[35:00] that means to us and you know it's
[35:02] something in your life and our lives you
[35:04] can tell if if there's just something a
[35:08] little missing and you just look and say
[35:12] Lord I just need a moment Lord I just
[35:15] need a moment Lord I just need some time
[35:19] you know sometimes with the the cares of
[35:21] life we can have the best the best plans
[35:25] of what we
[35:26] have May maybe in your time when you do
[35:29] your devotions of a morning or whenever
[35:32] you do your
[35:33] devotions then things will arise
[35:36] that it just doesn't happen that
[35:40] morning but you know I'm thankful that
[35:43] within that we always have to guard
[35:45] against it because it can start to
[35:46] become a string but we can always move
[35:49] back to it and realize that all it takes
[35:51] is just a moment whether you're sitting
[35:53] you're driving and say Lord am I want to
[35:57] invite you into this into this
[36:01] moment I desire your daily bread
[36:06] Lord I I need you Lord Lord lead me not
[36:09] into temptation Deliver Me From Evil
[36:12] amen we we always have that that
[36:14] privilege and you know it's just
[36:16] something about talking to him it
[36:18] Comforts us it Comforts us you know
[36:22] brother brand said it like this he said
[36:23] Jesus stayed in contact with his father
[36:26] through prayer
[36:29] and that's how we stay in contact with
[36:31] him amen amen you love him this
[36:35] evening and so good to be in the house
[36:37] of the Lord and good to be gathered
[36:40] together if you'd like to stand with us
[36:45] and I want to go back in here to pick up
[36:49] on on job and um looking at this thought
[36:54] we've been U dealing with on
[36:58] where the worrying and where job had
[37:01] come to in this with fear and I think I
[37:04] have just a couple uh maybe another
[37:07] place after this this service but we'll
[37:10] see but I want to uh look at this here
[37:14] just a little bit I I so
[37:16] enjoyed you know I enjoyed the the
[37:19] messages on
[37:21] hope I I so I will ask you to forgive me
[37:24] if I got a little beside myself but uh I
[37:27] really enjoyed those messages uh what
[37:29] the Lord give us you know I CU I I don't
[37:32] give them you know it's like brother
[37:33] brandham when he says they were uh the
[37:35] Collins they were looking at uh uh
[37:38] brother uh Neville and he was serving
[37:40] food in the Tabernacle and they got a
[37:42] little bit question what's he doing
[37:44] Serving food in the Tabernacle and
[37:47] brother brah said well what that is he
[37:48] said that was a was he brother Neville
[37:51] is preaching the same message that I
[37:54] preach and so this this food that we
[37:57] have is a perfect food to bring forth A
[38:00] Perfect Bride amen and I I'm just
[38:02] thankful God gives to us just what we
[38:04] have need of it and uh amen so I know
[38:07] when when I have a somebody that's
[38:09] waiting on me I don't want them sticking
[38:11] their finger in my plate and and tasting
[38:13] it but but I'll tell you here when we're
[38:15] talking about the word of God I want to
[38:17] eat with
[38:18] you amen I want to be a real partaker
[38:22] amen so in Job chapter 3 and verse
[38:25] 24 he said for my my sighing cometh
[38:29] before I eat and my roarings are poured
[38:31] out like the waters for the thing which
[38:35] I greatly feared is come upon me and
[38:38] that which I was afraid of is come unto
[38:41] me I was not in safety neither had I
[38:45] rest neither was I quiet yet trouble
[38:50] came so I'd just like to ask the Lord to
[38:53] help us once again in looking at this
[38:55] thought on overcoming coming fear and
[38:58] its effects and let's just bow our heads
[39:01] and let's just ask him that he'll just
[39:03] come and the author of the book and just
[39:05] speak to our hearts for what we have
[39:07] need of heavenly
[39:10] father Lord everything Lord is is spoken
[39:14] Lord in your word that you make all
[39:16] things beautiful in your time and how
[39:20] that Lord the writer would Lord write
[39:23] under inspiration and just to be able to
[39:26] declare that there there is a time for
[39:29] everything Lord and father to know that
[39:31] God that you're mindful of every season
[39:34] of life you're mindful of everything
[39:37] that we are facing and those things Lord
[39:40] that we lord would would go through Lord
[39:43] from the seasons of life to Lord
[39:45] changing Lord uh uh circumstances around
[39:49] us but father you're the one that stays
[39:52] constant Lord through it all as you said
[39:55] Lord through Malachi I'm God and I
[39:57] change not and Lord as you manifested it
[40:01] over and over in this generation and you
[40:04] still are manifesting yourself to be the
[40:07] same yesterday today and forever Lord
[40:10] that gives us a real strength and a real
[40:12] Comfort Lord that no matter what it is
[40:15] that we're facing you are the strength
[40:18] of our life Lord and you're the same one
[40:21] Lord that has brought us safely this far
[40:23] you'll take us Lord the rest of the way
[40:26] home so Lord we're looking to you father
[40:29] oh God once again this evening that you
[40:31] would just have your way in our midst
[40:33] Lord and come Lord and speak to our
[40:36] hearts Lord minister to us Lord I Lord
[40:40] have that which is laying before me Lord
[40:42] that we've studyed Lord and you would
[40:44] drop in our hearts Lord but father it
[40:47] takes you Lord to come and to breathe
[40:50] upon this word Lord and bring it to our
[40:53] lives Lord and just to guide us Lord in
[40:55] the things Lord that need to be said and
[40:58] to be spoken tonight and give us Lord
[41:01] the grace Lord I pray to receive it Lord
[41:04] and may we walk out of here Lord a
[41:06] different people than what we walked in
[41:08] Lord we love you and we thank you now
[41:10] father in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[41:14] amen God bless you as you're being
[41:16] seated
[41:18] amen I just want you to I would also
[41:21] covet your prayers
[41:23] we're uh I'll be here on Sunday and then
[41:26] right after that service I think some of
[41:28] our boys are going to head out to uh byc
[41:31] there on Saturday but then we'll go down
[41:33] on Sunday after service here uh for uh
[41:36] those those meetings there and I have
[41:39] some Services there to to minister to
[41:41] the young people and um I just really I
[41:45] I covet your prayers and um I think
[41:48] we're really living in a in a real
[41:50] moment in a real time and uh I think
[41:53] Satan he really he not only he's after
[41:56] each one he's after after young people
[41:58] and all alike and there's ways that
[42:00] Satan would even try to take things and
[42:02] want to bring confusion among the young
[42:04] people but I know the word's a a
[42:07] stabilizer and the word of God is our
[42:09] absolute to give us a real anchor and a
[42:11] hold a real experience a real Direction
[42:14] in our lives and and God knows of all
[42:16] the needs that would be uh gathered
[42:18] there you know there's a lot that when I
[42:20] was thinking about it today there's a
[42:21] lot goes through your heart uh even when
[42:24] you not only within those meetings but
[42:25] in other meetings and I look at and you
[42:27] know you just have such a a ride a wide
[42:31] array of of thoughts that come through
[42:33] uh for knowing that there will be so
[42:35] many different needs that are there but
[42:37] my prayer is God that you'll take every
[42:39] every counselor every Minister every
[42:42] individual that's there and Lord just
[42:44] come through there and minister to every
[42:46] single need and so we just I just ask
[42:49] that you would just join with us in
[42:51] prayer that the Lord will just have his
[42:53] way here in these in these services
[42:57] I want to in looking at this with
[42:59] overcoming fear and and its effect I've
[43:02] been drawing upon this from uh we've
[43:04] been drawing upon that from out of the
[43:06] message of perfect faith and I didn't
[43:08] put that quote up for you tonight but
[43:10] just where the Prophet is speaking of
[43:13] how that we understand that there are
[43:17] things that can come in our life just as
[43:18] much as he would say it in this way
[43:20] there's very key uh statements that
[43:23] he'll say even in perfect faith and
[43:25] he'll say the statement that the reason
[43:27] that that Faith came to the Lord Jesus
[43:30] was because he was the word and he would
[43:32] say when when you receive the word you
[43:35] become the word he would also speak to
[43:37] us and say you've got to be in that
[43:39] position in order for that Faith to come
[43:43] now we recognize that when that the
[43:46] faith of the Son of God or that faith
[43:49] that jod would write that we were to
[43:51] earnestly contend for we know that that
[43:53] Faith itself is God's Own Faith that's
[43:56] God's own life that's when where by the
[43:58] Holy Spirit our lives have been
[44:01] transformed and there now is a real
[44:04] Supernatural super sense of God's Own
[44:07] Faith living and moving in our life and
[44:11] then we realize that as we approach so
[44:13] many different things we are having a
[44:16] faith and God's desire is that we would
[44:18] have such a faith within his word and to
[44:22] just stand upon his word and then as
[44:24] we're standing there and in position
[44:27] then when it comes that there is a need
[44:29] that arises and when God would need or
[44:32] would would need or would come to drop
[44:35] something in our life then we are
[44:37] available as a channel to where that
[44:40] faith can drop for whatever need that we
[44:42] have and so sometimes you know cretion
[44:45] is certainly something that should
[44:47] always be a part of our life we Satan
[44:50] wants to constantly want to try to take
[44:52] us away from consecration but that's the
[44:55] real strength of a Believer is a
[44:57] consecrated life and a consecrated walk
[44:59] with God the Bible says regarding Enoch
[45:02] that before he was translated he had
[45:05] this testimony that he pleased God so it
[45:08] was a consecrated life and this is
[45:11] something that it brings us and puts us
[45:13] into position for those things that even
[45:17] when God would drop down into our life
[45:19] and things would come such as let's say
[45:22] you have need of of healing in your body
[45:24] you know the doctors and everything else
[45:27] that they've they've done and uh that
[45:29] can be done but yet as you're taking a
[45:31] hold and you've been holding on God's
[45:33] promise that by his stripes I'm Healed
[45:35] I'm the Lord that Health all thine
[45:37] diseases and you're just taking hold
[45:39] upon every one of those promises and as
[45:41] a Believer you should do that that's a
[45:45] faith that will say that I know God and
[45:48] I know him who made the promise and this
[45:51] is why that I'm holding on to that
[45:53] promise now we don't know exactly as
[45:55] we're standing there I don't know if
[45:57] it's going to come what way it's going
[45:58] to come I don't know the next moment I
[46:00] don't know but all that God would
[46:03] require of me and you is to stand with
[46:05] the faith in his word then we become a
[46:08] channel that's available for God to move
[46:11] through and job was a channel remember
[46:14] he was a Channel of inspiration for God
[46:16] to move through but because he wasn't
[46:19] receiving any inspiration from God
[46:23] that's where he got to worrying the
[46:25] prophet said when you get to in that
[46:26] that kind of a fix that's when Satan
[46:29] moves in to all of your friends he'll
[46:32] move into everyone around and then it
[46:34] starts to become
[46:37] accusing why here that worrying opens up
[46:40] and and then fear itself sets in and
[46:43] when fear sets in that's a bad situation
[46:46] brother Ram said if you had cancer I
[46:49] read this quote to you before if you had
[46:51] cancer but didn't fear it you would be
[46:54] in a really good shape he said but if
[46:57] you have fear well he said that's that's
[46:59] in a real bad shape because fear itself
[47:02] is torment now there's a difference
[47:05] between the fear of the Lord and the
[47:08] fear that Satan would bring there's a
[47:11] the fear of God is clean the Bible says
[47:14] it's a reverence to the things of God As
[47:16] a matter of fact without having a real
[47:18] fear of God you can never please God but
[47:22] this fear is a fear that came because of
[47:24] the fall and even as we would walk here
[47:28] in this realm and in these bodies we
[47:31] will have to battle it and resist it and
[47:35] overcome it and there's only one way
[47:36] we're going to be able to overcome it
[47:38] and that's by the word of God in our
[47:42] lives it's just like this we are
[47:45] commissioned to cast Satan out that's
[47:49] good that's what we're commission to do
[47:52] and the prophet when he takes this this
[47:54] scripture here in job uh the that we
[47:57] just read here where job said the thing
[47:59] which I greatly feared has come upon me
[48:01] and that which I was afraid of has come
[48:03] unto me he goes into this of how that
[48:06] this this fear he says it was this fear
[48:10] that actually brought the condition
[48:13] about in job's life his fear is what
[48:16] brought it to him he was scared it was
[48:18] going to happen and he says you know if
[48:20] you're afraid when you come in the
[48:22] prayer line it's not going to happen I'm
[48:24] not going to receive anything I'm not
[48:26] going to get anything then he says it
[48:28] won't now this to me is where's a this
[48:31] is a great Paradox when I look at this
[48:34] here was job a man that had such a hold
[48:38] on God and you know I'm using the
[48:41] prophet's words such a hold on God and
[48:43] he had a hold on God by divine
[48:47] revelation and yet this this fear that
[48:50] had come in and what job actually
[48:53] greatly feared it happened to him but
[48:56] you know that that in itself did not
[48:59] diminish one iota that he was a Son of
[49:02] God that's right it did not take away
[49:06] that that faith of that reality of what
[49:09] God had given to him because job still
[49:12] stood when the accusers come and stood
[49:14] and said I know where I'm standing on
[49:16] God's word he was job did not have a
[49:20] make believe
[49:22] Faith you know where we're looking at
[49:25] something other than the word of God his
[49:28] life was examined by the word and that's
[49:31] what gave job the strength to stand when
[49:34] his accusers were all around and you
[49:37] know like as one writer said it you had
[49:39] guys there that were actually automatc
[49:42] that would do surgery on I and trying to
[49:44] perform heart surgery on job in other
[49:47] words they had a lot of word but it was
[49:50] the wrong application and why was it
[49:53] being applied wrongly cuz they didn't
[49:56] know God the way job knew
[49:59] God that's what makes the difference
[50:02] that's why the token makes a difference
[50:05] the token raises the word of God and
[50:08] brings forth in your life as a believer
[50:11] that every word is yay and amen in him
[50:17] Hallelujah that is so good so fear
[50:21] itself faith is a substance fear is a
[50:24] substance it is torment right faith
[50:27] faith itself it produces a joy is that
[50:31] right fear fear being a substance it
[50:34] produces torment worry weary right dread
[50:39] fear itself can cause cause lives to
[50:42] avoid certain situations that's right so
[50:46] it's a real it's a real thing but I want
[50:48] to I I don't want to elevate fear I want
[50:51] to see I want you to see tonight we're
[50:53] here to elevate the almighty God these
[50:56] are things that we are are faced with
[50:58] like job was but God gives us Grace to
[51:02] live with a real strength and a
[51:04] fortitude in this hour I want to read
[51:07] here from Isaiah 12 and verse 1 and as
[51:10] we're reading from here I want you to
[51:12] think of how that you know even when a
[51:14] doctor is going to give you medicine the
[51:17] first thing that he tries to get you to
[51:19] do is get you to have confidence in that
[51:22] medicine and that's exactly because it's
[51:25] it's faith that does the healing and so
[51:29] God's desire be the word let me just say
[51:31] it like this the word is sufficient to
[51:34] the challenge that you face and God's
[51:38] Desire with his presence coming his word
[51:41] listen God could say what he needs to
[51:43] say even here tonight he could say it in
[51:45] one sentence but God takes through a
[51:48] whole part where you know here we are
[51:50] studying and laboring and praying and
[51:52] God will take through a wholeness of
[51:54] service to work to bring you and I to a
[51:58] faith to where our faith is increased in
[52:01] him not in a man in him amen are you
[52:06] hearing me that's good so notice I love
[52:08] this here this is even speaking of
[52:10] Israel's restoration but I want to draw
[52:13] for some places here in verse one in
[52:16] that day Thou shalt say oh Lord I will
[52:19] praise thee though thou was angry with
[52:21] me thine anger is turned away and thou
[52:25] comforest me praise the Lord that's so
[52:27] good why because the sin debt has been
[52:30] satisfied let me tell you something
[52:32] tonight you're not dealing with an Angry
[52:34] God hallelujah it's not God's anger or
[52:38] wrath that's bringing conviction it is
[52:40] the love of God that brings conviction
[52:43] because conviction leads you to the
[52:46] place of acceptance and righteousness in
[52:48] him that's why the prophet said I used
[52:51] to think that God was angry with me but
[52:54] Jesus loved me then I come to find out
[52:57] they're the same
[53:00] person see what a confession now in
[53:03] verse one is's no longer I'm no longer
[53:05] under the wrath of God I'm under the
[53:07] safety of God I'm abiding under his word
[53:10] his word has found me out his word has
[53:12] brought it to the reality the debt has
[53:14] been settled I know who I am as a
[53:16] Believer and it's settled that's the
[53:21] testimony verse two behold God is my
[53:25] salvation
[53:27] praise the Lord amen let me tell you
[53:29] he's your salvation even
[53:31] today when you needed saving from
[53:34] thoughts that were going through your
[53:35] mind he was your
[53:38] salvation when situations arose this
[53:41] week he was your
[53:44] salvation he is not was he is is my
[53:50] salvation that's so good I will trust
[53:53] and not be afraid for the Lord
[53:57] Jehovah is my strength and my song You
[54:01] may notice how that phrase is put
[54:03] together in the scriptures even when
[54:05] they come across the Red Sea and
[54:06] different places my strength and my song
[54:09] He's The Melody of my life you know the
[54:12] Bible tells us in the book of Colossians
[54:14] it tells us that how that the peace of
[54:16] God Is To Rule and reign in our life and
[54:19] it tells us in Colossians and Ephesians
[54:21] that making melody in our hearts singing
[54:24] Psalms and hymns let the word of God
[54:27] dwell in you
[54:29] richly there's a lot of things we can
[54:31] have dwell in our minds and going over
[54:33] in our minds you know how it is you from
[54:36] songs that God's delivered you from even
[54:39] from certain places you've been and all
[54:41] of a sudden you can just start hear in
[54:42] that tune and certain things will start
[54:44] coming back to you stanzas of that song
[54:46] what they'll sing next that's in the
[54:49] gate of memory in your spirit not your
[54:51] soul in your
[54:53] spirit but God has a way that when he'll
[54:57] come by and begin to move through his
[54:59] word and begin to sing over your life
[55:02] and begin to pulsate through your life
[55:04] it will take you from that condition and
[55:07] where you're at and bring you into that
[55:09] place to where I know that my redeemer
[55:14] liveth my he also is become my salvation
[55:18] now watch this in verse three therefore
[55:21] with
[55:22] joy shall you draw water out of the
[55:25] wells
[55:27] of
[55:28] Salvation many Wells but one salvation
[55:31] he is all things to us he has become all
[55:36] things all the Redemptive names of
[55:38] Jehovah are summed up and tied up in
[55:41] Jesus Christ he is my
[55:45] salvation amen there are rivers of
[55:48] Living Water is that right but is's one
[55:50] living water many
[55:52] rivers not many ways he alone is the way
[55:56] but he is all things to
[56:00] me now I want you to think of this here
[56:04] very carefully that when we're looking
[56:06] and approaching for things that we could
[56:09] see and be before us in our life things
[56:12] that we come up against things that we
[56:15] will face and you know God God knows
[56:19] just what to bring us to and when to
[56:21] bring it when to bring us to it he knows
[56:24] just when he's God's not in the business
[56:27] of overwhelming us to where we would
[56:29] pull back and just throw up our hands
[56:31] God brings us to the place where he is
[56:35] coming to uh where you and I come to a
[56:38] place to overcome in certain places in
[56:41] our life just like when he led them out
[56:43] of Egypt he didn't take them that
[56:46] certain way which would have been much
[56:48] closer he didn't do it they weren't
[56:50] ready for battle he took him through the
[56:52] Red Sea why did God take him through the
[56:54] Red Sea he want wanted to take a
[56:57] circumstance that looked impossible how
[57:00] do you get across this water when s when
[57:03] they are behind my back how do you do
[57:05] that God was doing that to teach them
[57:08] something that when you do come into
[57:10] battle I'm a way
[57:13] maker when something when the enemy us
[57:16] hot breath is hot on your Trail I'm a
[57:19] way maker keep walking our way make a
[57:22] way speak the word and go forward God
[57:25] was teaching teaching them yes along the
[57:29] way yes sir now in the so as God brings
[57:35] us to the places that we need to be
[57:37] brought to there's times that in our
[57:40] lives that we come into uh the
[57:43] situations and we everything sometimes
[57:46] it'll begin with a right mental attitude
[57:49] toward the promise of God that's where
[57:52] it always should begin you know F we've
[57:54] got after whatever news or whatever's
[57:56] come up we we got to come back around to
[57:58] a place to what God has said and God's
[58:01] word is true that's where we that's
[58:03] where everything has to start building
[58:04] this is our hope is in the Lord now
[58:07] notice and brother Bram says this I want
[58:09] you to listen this and as the eagle stir
[58:11] at his nest brother Bram says if any
[58:14] persons will take the right uh attitude
[58:18] uh towards any Divine promise that God
[58:20] has made it'll bring it to pass if you
[58:23] could take the right attitude towards
[58:24] what he said it'll bring bring it to
[58:26] pass no just the right attitude I've
[58:29] been I've seen sarom cancer leave people
[58:32] by the same thing wow the right mental
[58:35] attitude now remember it's not your mind
[58:38] or my mind that's doing it it's not mind
[58:42] over matter it's the word that we're
[58:45] taking
[58:46] in you got to be careful what we're
[58:48] taking in I mean we're living in a day
[58:50] and age you don't even have to go home
[58:52] to look up oh I got an ache here and I
[58:54] got a crook here and I got a
[58:57] let's see what my smart phone says right
[59:02] is that right but sometimes I understand
[59:04] we can we can look things up but if
[59:06] we're not careful friends sometimes the
[59:09] things that we'll start reading and
[59:11] looking at then it's just like there
[59:13] sets in upon us oh my I and I'm not
[59:17] talking about ignoring things I'm not
[59:18] talking about pretending that things
[59:20] aren't there but I'm just saying that
[59:22] there is such about and around us of
[59:25] things to where fear itself can come in
[59:28] through many different avenues like like
[59:32] this you're getting ready to fly
[59:33] somewhere and somebody comes up to you
[59:35] and says hey do you see that you see
[59:37] what happened just a little bit ago that
[59:39] plane dropped 27,000 ft right in the air
[59:41] just like
[59:42] that you got a choice whether you're
[59:45] going to accept that or
[59:48] not you understand there's things
[59:51] that'll come that way that you don't
[59:52] have no control over but you this is
[59:54] where you've got to know I know where
[59:56] God has called me
[1:00:00] to you got to know that the footsteps of
[1:00:03] the righteous are order of the Lord I'm
[1:00:05] trusting in the
[1:00:08] Lord yes brother R says maybe you won't
[1:00:11] be able to receive enough to deliver you
[1:00:14] all of a sudden listen very closely but
[1:00:16] he says if you can't receive enough
[1:00:19] Faith to be healed instantly then take
[1:00:22] the adopted baby route he said did you
[1:00:24] ever hear of the adopted baby now
[1:00:26] brother br will talk about this many
[1:00:28] places in the message but he says if you
[1:00:30] take a young woman she'll maybe be
[1:00:32] married she and her husband and she's
[1:00:34] scared she isn't going to have a baby
[1:00:38] she wants one and she's so scared she
[1:00:41] won't have it she won't because just
[1:00:44] like job said notice he's putting the
[1:00:47] scriptural principle what is it that's
[1:00:49] regulating it why that that woman will
[1:00:53] not become with child it's the principle
[1:00:56] because like job said the things that I
[1:00:59] feared the most come upon
[1:01:01] me that's why I don't think you should
[1:01:04] ever speak things out well I'm afraid
[1:01:07] this will happen I'm afraid this will
[1:01:08] happen I tell you what you might as well
[1:01:10] go ahead and open your mailbox it's
[1:01:12] coming don't don't speak those things
[1:01:15] well I tell you when is all this going
[1:01:17] to end when is all this don't don't
[1:01:19] welcome it
[1:01:20] in don't welcome it
[1:01:22] in don't welcome it in the fear itself
[1:01:27] if fear this is what brought this to job
[1:01:30] now the prophet is helping us to see
[1:01:32] this even in a contrast setting of where
[1:01:34] there's fear where she won't be able to
[1:01:37] have a baby where did this fear come
[1:01:38] from I don't know there's many different
[1:01:41] ways that fear could have come there
[1:01:42] could have been many experiences down
[1:01:44] through life maybe certain things that
[1:01:46] she's been told certain things that
[1:01:48] she's experienced I don't know maybe
[1:01:50] things that's come down through in their
[1:01:52] family but at any rate Satan is an
[1:01:55] opport tunist wherever that he can slip
[1:01:58] fear in he'll do it that's right notice
[1:02:03] he says but if the doctors you know
[1:02:05] probably there's nurses setting here he
[1:02:07] says you take that same woman and let
[1:02:09] her adopt a baby then she'll have one
[1:02:13] herself it quietens
[1:02:16] her now I tell you what if this what if
[1:02:19] this little lady says no I don't want to
[1:02:21] adopt a baby I don't want to adopt it I
[1:02:23] don't want to do it then there's
[1:02:24] probably she she may never be delivered
[1:02:27] of that fear but if she will adopt a
[1:02:29] baby what does it do the adopted baby
[1:02:32] begins to set her in the right emotion
[1:02:36] it begins to open those channels as her
[1:02:39] Focus are you hearing me her focus is
[1:02:42] off of her fear and her Focus becomes on
[1:02:45] the product and as their focus begins to
[1:02:49] happen then there's changes that are
[1:02:51] happening in her that allow her to open
[1:02:54] in order to receive
[1:02:57] I I'll read some things medically here
[1:02:59] in just a minute notice if you haven't
[1:03:01] got enough Faith to receive it right now
[1:03:04] as a
[1:03:06] miracle then take the adopted baby
[1:03:09] attitude I'll just go ahead and say it
[1:03:11] Lord I'm not too big to take the adopted
[1:03:15] baby I'm not too big however you want to
[1:03:18] do it Lord however it's going but I'm
[1:03:20] going to tell you this right here when
[1:03:21] situation I'm going to take God's
[1:03:24] promise and God's word because God's
[1:03:26] word is always right yes I'm the one
[1:03:28] who's
[1:03:29] wrong notice here's how you take that
[1:03:31] attitude lord it's mine because you
[1:03:35] promised it I'll go from here tonight
[1:03:38] praising you just the same as I was well
[1:03:43] watch what happens you'll receive it it
[1:03:46] has to happen God promised
[1:03:50] it hallelujah oh Hallelujah watch this
[1:03:54] if you can just feel just a least little
[1:03:59] speck of faith not a great big but a
[1:04:01] least little speck of faith that tells
[1:04:04] you you'll be all right you believe it
[1:04:08] and just go on thanking him for it oh
[1:04:11] watch this application notice he says
[1:04:13] they hadn't received the Holy Spirit on
[1:04:16] the day of Pentecost they were 10 days
[1:04:18] up there thanking the lord praising him
[1:04:21] for the promise of the Holy Ghost and
[1:04:23] all of a sudden it came like a Russian
[1:04:26] Mighty wi you believe it with all your
[1:04:31] heart
[1:04:32] [Music]
[1:04:33] hallelujah amen I'll take the adopted
[1:04:36] baby
[1:04:37] route Hall you know why it takes your
[1:04:41] focus off of you and your abilities or
[1:04:44] inabilities and it puts our focus into
[1:04:47] the god upon God who brings forth life
[1:04:51] do you realize that's why the preaching
[1:04:52] of the word is when you come and sit
[1:04:55] here this is not you deciding what tapee
[1:04:57] you're going to listen to this is not
[1:04:59] you deciding what quote or what
[1:05:01] scripture it's God coming on the scene
[1:05:04] and he's putting your focus on the word
[1:05:07] where it needs to be for your life
[1:05:11] that's why the prophet said the
[1:05:12] preaching of the word is to put our mind
[1:05:15] on
[1:05:16] Calvary
[1:05:18] Hallelujah that is so good it doesn't
[1:05:21] matter brother B goes on he says person
[1:05:23] in a wheelchair person with answer he
[1:05:26] says it doesn't matter heart trouble
[1:05:29] tubercular if the doctor has given up on
[1:05:32] you don't lose courage God is still on
[1:05:36] the throne that is so good yes sir oh my
[1:05:40] brother B says that in another place he
[1:05:42] said she's afraid she's not going to
[1:05:44] have a baby she won't have it but you
[1:05:46] let her adopt it and she'll have one he
[1:05:48] said the books claim nine out of 10 will
[1:05:51] do that and some of you I know you
[1:05:52] listen to a and my wife does we have
[1:05:55] we've had to listen to the Collins were
[1:05:58] family I I like them um but uh you know
[1:06:02] she here you you some of you that that
[1:06:04] that follow them in their and their
[1:06:06] music you you know the one is it is it
[1:06:08] Courtney Courtney her and her husband
[1:06:10] they were over in Thailand and went to
[1:06:12] adopt a baby during covid times and here
[1:06:14] they were stuck in the hotel had to
[1:06:16] quarantine for so long and everything
[1:06:18] else and do all of this well it wasn't
[1:06:20] but a short bit of time after they
[1:06:22] adopted that baby she had one
[1:06:27] I couldn't help but when I look at that
[1:06:29] I thought this exactly what brother
[1:06:30] bram's talking
[1:06:32] about so I I I I do enjoy their music I
[1:06:36] we just kind I kind of pick on my wife a
[1:06:38] little bit me and the boys you know but
[1:06:41] I really do enjoy enjoy them but I think
[1:06:43] they have some real inspired songs and I
[1:06:45] really enjoyed them but notice within
[1:06:48] this I I say it in that way that you can
[1:06:49] see these things that happens it says
[1:06:52] what brother B says it sets her body
[1:06:55] into the right emotion it puts her in
[1:06:58] the right attitude you know they've
[1:07:00] actually studies where they've done that
[1:07:03] will say that you know but that stress
[1:07:05] alone it'll say stress alone when they
[1:07:08] you know doctors have looked at this
[1:07:09] that stress alone cannot cause
[1:07:11] infertility but stress will interfere
[1:07:14] with a woman's ability to get pregnant
[1:07:17] it talks about how all of these things
[1:07:19] there was one a doctor had done one
[1:07:21] particular thing looking at fear and its
[1:07:23] effects on the body and how that there
[1:07:26] was a woman that actually had a fear of
[1:07:29] pain during pregnancy now she wasn't
[1:07:31] pregnant but she had a fear of pain from
[1:07:35] being pregnant and that fear because of
[1:07:38] coming into the the pregnancy and the
[1:07:40] and the delivery that fear actually
[1:07:43] closed her Fallopian
[1:07:46] tubes wow the doctor that was studying
[1:07:49] and looking at all of this they looked
[1:07:51] at they knew infection injury can cause
[1:07:53] those things to close but it I I never
[1:07:56] seen it like this but it was actually he
[1:07:58] says now we know that even emotional
[1:08:01] crisis and shock can close these tubes
[1:08:04] just as it will make one clench its fist
[1:08:07] let me tell you if that will happen that
[1:08:09] way when it comes to Natural conception
[1:08:12] what do you think the enemy would try to
[1:08:14] do when it would come to spiritual
[1:08:16] conception he would like to try to put
[1:08:19] such a stress and such attenion he'll
[1:08:22] try to also distract you he'll try to
[1:08:24] run you down he'll say it's not for you
[1:08:27] he'll put all of those things to try to
[1:08:28] do what get you in a place to where
[1:08:30] you're so tense but you cannot receive
[1:08:34] when you're tense But realize that the
[1:08:36] God who is speaking to you knows all
[1:08:39] about you it is God that will bring it
[1:08:42] to pass let me just say it to you don't
[1:08:45] ever you're not God is not a God that
[1:08:47] puts you under pressure to receive
[1:08:50] something this moment do this or do that
[1:08:52] God does not do that he presence brings
[1:08:57] us to
[1:09:00] yield because remember your
[1:09:04] experience is out of Satan's Eden your
[1:09:07] experience is predestinated from the
[1:09:09] hand of God brother Bram said the Holy
[1:09:12] Ghost is not schooled into you
[1:09:18] am Hallelujah but this this sh this This
[1:09:21] Woman's fear her deep fear of pain what
[1:09:24] it was they begin to find out it was her
[1:09:27] deep fear of pain that was associated
[1:09:29] with childbirth and these watch this
[1:09:32] these fears and images were placed in
[1:09:35] her when she was a
[1:09:37] child she's living under the effects of
[1:09:40] things that took place when she was a
[1:09:43] child now who put these images was it
[1:09:46] was it mom was it people sitting around
[1:09:48] was it things you know s and I you know
[1:09:50] I mean sometimes you almost you know in
[1:09:52] one way you feel sorry for you know
[1:09:54] young sisters they get around and
[1:09:55] talking other I tell you what man I
[1:09:57] would
[1:09:59] never you almost want to say let's leave
[1:10:02] God bless you we'll see you at church
[1:10:04] remind me to fellowship with you from a
[1:10:09] distance you understand what I'm saying
[1:10:11] you know I'm not saying that we're not
[1:10:13] you know to to be ignorant of things but
[1:10:15] I I think also sometimes it's things
[1:10:17] that we're we're also tested cuz we
[1:10:19] can't keep everything in a bubble to
[1:10:22] where it's all going to happen you know
[1:10:23] all of a sudden we rock up can you
[1:10:25] imagine husband walking up to his wife
[1:10:27] cuing her ears and saying come on let's
[1:10:28] go honey what are you
[1:10:32] doing so there's things that we we
[1:10:35] cannot close out it's going to be there
[1:10:37] we're going to be tested but God gives
[1:10:39] us Grace to overcome notice these
[1:10:41] spheres and images were placed in her as
[1:10:43] a child and how that even her
[1:10:45] reproductive system had actually come to
[1:10:48] a place to reacting to the fear and that
[1:10:51] power upon the mind you know what
[1:10:53] brother Ram's wife sister mey
[1:10:56] remember that when after um uh uh
[1:10:59] Rebecca had come the doctors had told
[1:11:03] him don't try to have no more
[1:11:05] children but God spoke to the prophet's
[1:11:07] heart when he was up there praying for a
[1:11:09] meeting he said oh God I'd like to have
[1:11:13] I'd love to have you know a son like
[1:11:15] Joseph I would name him Joseph so they
[1:11:19] have a baby here comes a baby but it
[1:11:22] ain't Joseph it's Sarah right
[1:11:26] right now when God had dropped that into
[1:11:29] the prophet's heart the prophet didn't
[1:11:31] say well I guess I got it wrong you know
[1:11:33] I mean it it must have been
[1:11:35] Sarah but he you see this is what I'm
[1:11:37] trying to tell you this was not when
[1:11:40] brother Brown prayed that way and God
[1:11:42] dropped that in his heart that wasn't
[1:11:44] brother brandom pushing himself out into
[1:11:48] something see that that's not Faith but
[1:11:51] faith when that when that perfect faith
[1:11:54] has come when that faith that substance
[1:11:56] for for that particular situ God dropped
[1:11:59] that it wasn't anything brother brandham
[1:12:00] created or brother brandham brought it
[1:12:02] down God had him read in the Bible he's
[1:12:05] reading in the Bible how many times his
[1:12:07] brother Brown and read on
[1:12:09] Joseph but in that moment inspiration
[1:12:12] struck him and his
[1:12:15] request and here comes Sarah remember
[1:12:17] how the nurses made fun say oh you must
[1:12:19] have mean
[1:12:21] Josephine but here was here was Sister
[1:12:24] brandom Sister meting brother R
[1:12:26] describes this of how that when here she
[1:12:30] was expecting and this is the time that
[1:12:33] you know it was Joseph and I they didn't
[1:12:34] know they didn't have all those things
[1:12:36] back then you know I guess to know and
[1:12:38] what whatever what whatever the gender
[1:12:39] of the baby was but you know four years
[1:12:42] had passed since that and his wife you
[1:12:44] know brother BR says we were real tore
[1:12:46] up and everything you know she was sick
[1:12:47] and nervous and brother Bram talks about
[1:12:50] how the the the lady who had been there
[1:12:51] to help deliver every one of the
[1:12:53] children uh you know and she was one
[1:12:56] that actually had been healed in a
[1:12:57] meeting of cancer and was actually on
[1:12:59] the list for somebody dying from cancer
[1:13:01] but God had healed her but she wasn't
[1:13:04] able to be there she'd been there all
[1:13:05] the other times but she wasn't able to
[1:13:08] be there because she was out of town her
[1:13:10] name was Sister Margie and so you know
[1:13:12] some things when things just aren't you
[1:13:14] know just we what we call normal this
[1:13:18] person's there this person's here and
[1:13:20] this and oh then brother Brown said then
[1:13:23] you had this he said where a lady was
[1:13:24] coming through and he said this woman
[1:13:27] was coming through and she'd made a
[1:13:28] statement that I needed to listen to her
[1:13:31] God was telling her to tell me something
[1:13:33] and if I didn't do this God was going to
[1:13:36] take the airplane out of the sky that I
[1:13:38] was riding on he said but it never
[1:13:40] happened he said I was out on a on a
[1:13:42] hiking trip and she said you know when I
[1:13:44] was out hunting trip he said when I you
[1:13:46] know I was going to be out there and
[1:13:48] going to fall off the mountain and and
[1:13:50] break my arm and Hunters would be out
[1:13:52] looking for me but he said was no word
[1:13:53] of it so but he said then when she
[1:13:56] couldn't get my attention that way she
[1:13:58] went up and she she sent word to my wife
[1:14:00] and said because your husband will not
[1:14:03] listen to me God's going to kill you
[1:14:05] during this child
[1:14:11] birth and brother Bram says it like this
[1:14:13] he says and it got to the poor little
[1:14:17] fellow it got to Sister mey here she is
[1:14:22] right she's the prophet's wife not just
[1:14:24] the prophet's friend right see fear
[1:14:27] doesn't look upon the door and say oh
[1:14:30] this is the prophet of the hour oh
[1:14:32] you're a believer in Malachi 4 fear
[1:14:34] doesn't look at it that way but here is
[1:14:36] a situation where her emotions and
[1:14:40] things are so
[1:14:41] tender and something that would you
[1:14:43] would look at how in the world could she
[1:14:45] even entertain that but you see
[1:14:48] sometimes the way the emotions and how
[1:14:50] that can be all set up and tensed within
[1:14:53] that moment in that time and it got her
[1:14:55] all worked up to the ram said he went
[1:14:57] out to the cave he began to pray and as
[1:14:59] he went out to pray he said he said the
[1:15:01] Lord told me go back to your car and
[1:15:03] you're going to find your Bible open and
[1:15:05] I want you to read where your Bible is
[1:15:06] open brother Bram said I got back to the
[1:15:08] car he said I looked he said and the
[1:15:10] Bible was open to where Nath had told
[1:15:12] David do all that's in your heart for
[1:15:14] I'm with you brother Bram said I left
[1:15:16] out of there he said I was weeping I was
[1:15:18] crying on my way home he said I got out
[1:15:20] of the car I put my arm around her and
[1:15:22] said it's going to be all right he said
[1:15:25] and that settled it
[1:15:32] Hallelujah fear came but God was the
[1:15:36] answer to cast that fear out and this is
[1:15:40] why that when we look at I want you just
[1:15:42] to think on in in these aspects of it in
[1:15:45] Deuteronomy chapter 2 when God would
[1:15:48] speak to Israel they're getting ready to
[1:15:50] come into the land and I want you to
[1:15:52] notice how how crucial it is that God
[1:15:55] would speak to Israel when they're
[1:15:57] coming into the L and he would remind
[1:16:00] them not only of what belongs to them
[1:16:03] but God lets them know that hey there's
[1:16:06] other Giants and I have taken down those
[1:16:10] other Giants for these other nations let
[1:16:13] me read it to you when the Bible says
[1:16:16] here in verse 29 or verse 19 of
[1:16:19] Deuteronomy 2 when thou comest nigh over
[1:16:22] against the children of Amon distress
[1:16:24] them not nor medal with them for I will
[1:16:26] not give thee of the land of the
[1:16:28] children of Amon any possession because
[1:16:30] I have given it unto the children of lot
[1:16:32] for a possession that was also accounted
[1:16:35] a land of giants Giants dwelt therein in
[1:16:38] Old Time and the ammonites called them
[1:16:41] zumans a people great and many and tall
[1:16:44] as the Anakin but the Lord destroyed
[1:16:47] them before them and they succeeded them
[1:16:50] and dwelt in their stad look the
[1:16:52] ammonites were not even the children of
[1:16:54] the promise
[1:16:55] right and they had Giants and God wiped
[1:16:59] them Giants
[1:17:01] out listen friends we're not the only
[1:17:04] place the bride is not the only one who
[1:17:06] experiences healings and miracles and
[1:17:09] signs and
[1:17:11] wonders that's why that healings
[1:17:13] miracles signs and wonders that's not
[1:17:15] the bride's
[1:17:17] Revival the bride's Revival is the word
[1:17:20] living inside of a people and yes
[1:17:24] miracle and and signs will follow them
[1:17:27] that
[1:17:30] believe Hallelujah but notice this has
[1:17:34] been they've been disinherited and these
[1:17:37] Giants these isum are just like the
[1:17:40] anakims verse 22 as he did to the
[1:17:43] children of Israel which dwelt in sire
[1:17:45] when he destroyed the horms before them
[1:17:47] they succeeded them and dwelt in their
[1:17:49] stad even unto this day and the aens
[1:17:52] which dwelt in hazam and even unto asah
[1:17:55] the the cims that came forth out of
[1:17:58] capter destroyed them and dwelt in their
[1:18:00] stead so no all of these other Giants
[1:18:03] that have been destroyed the anakims
[1:18:05] were not the only
[1:18:07] Giants but there had been people who
[1:18:10] were not even the children of God but
[1:18:13] they themselves had received enough
[1:18:15] Faith to take what possession God was
[1:18:18] going to give them is that right this is
[1:18:22] so here God what's why is God doing this
[1:18:25] he's letting them know I'm the same God
[1:18:28] for you what I've opened and I've showed
[1:18:32] you I'm the God to bring it to pass just
[1:18:35] as I have through
[1:18:36] them you see fear dominated that
[1:18:39] previous
[1:18:40] generation fear dominated him fear was
[1:18:43] greater than the love of God because
[1:18:45] God's love brings
[1:18:49] confidence is that right this is why
[1:18:51] when you look at the scriptures the
[1:18:53] scriptures called them men of
[1:18:55] War they were Men of War that was not
[1:18:58] occupied with the love of God there was
[1:19:01] fighting among
[1:19:03] them come on friends fighting among them
[1:19:06] putting down and cutting out and all of
[1:19:08] that stuff but this is why the love of
[1:19:11] God was not having preeminence right let
[1:19:14] me tell you the love of God is not some
[1:19:16] basic thing right the love of God is the
[1:19:21] Capstone is that right is God's sitting
[1:19:25] down upon his church
[1:19:28] am this is why well we could preach on
[1:19:31] that on the men of War there for a
[1:19:32] little bit but you see when it God God
[1:19:35] is not in the business of tearing down
[1:19:38] are you hearing me tearing one another
[1:19:39] down God is not in the business of that
[1:19:41] but notice we we may God help us to see
[1:19:44] the value of living in the atmosphere of
[1:19:47] divine love and choosing to bring every
[1:19:50] thought subject to The Obedience just
[1:19:52] like the prophet did when it came to the
[1:19:54] Hornets the maniac and the bull brother
[1:19:58] brand would say it like this he would
[1:20:00] tell us if you're the least Speck angry
[1:20:04] on the platform might as well walk
[1:20:07] off at least little speck angry don't
[1:20:09] don't approach that don't don't approach
[1:20:11] him don't talk about it just walk
[1:20:14] away and brother BR say like this you
[1:20:16] pray until you feel different in your
[1:20:19] heart and I love how he finishes that
[1:20:21] quote he said trust me I know what I'm
[1:20:23] talking about
[1:20:26] amen yes
[1:20:27] sir this is why the scripture said there
[1:20:30] is no fear 1 John 4:18 in love but
[1:20:33] perfect love casteth out fear because
[1:20:37] fear hath torment he that feareth is not
[1:20:41] made perfect in love right now that fear
[1:20:46] that God comes to settle that fear and
[1:20:49] bring a settling in our heart by the
[1:20:53] holy spirit that we know that our spirit
[1:20:57] beareth witness with his spirit that we
[1:20:59] are the children of God in other words
[1:21:02] my soul says Amen to every word of God
[1:21:07] when I walk the the Lotus when Aaron
[1:21:09] would walk it was bells and pomegranates
[1:21:12] when I walk my walk is an amen to the
[1:21:14] word of God not just when I'm in church
[1:21:17] when I'm outside of church it's a life
[1:21:19] that is in harmony with God because why
[1:21:22] it is his love that has come to me his
[1:21:26] love that has done a work in my life and
[1:21:28] I have received that love that love that
[1:21:31] I did not deserve that love that
[1:21:33] overrode every doubt that love that came
[1:21:36] and it moved in my life and what was it
[1:21:39] it caused me to repent of my sins it
[1:21:42] cost me to lay my life down and that
[1:21:45] love moved in little by little until
[1:21:48] eventually that love took its rightful
[1:21:50] position and my life is ruled and rained
[1:21:54] by the love of God I do only those
[1:21:57] things that's pleasing to him if I've
[1:21:59] done something that's off the love of
[1:22:01] God corrects me and my desire is to come
[1:22:04] in line with his word amen hallelujah
[1:22:08] and you see that keeps us in a
[1:22:12] position for perfect
[1:22:14] Faith this is why I like how brother BR
[1:22:17] would say these things over and over
[1:22:18] regarding the bull The Hornet and the
[1:22:20] maniac he would say it like this in the
[1:22:22] message love and regarding that of the
[1:22:24] bull and the and those things he said it
[1:22:26] was love little phrase I'm going to read
[1:22:28] here it was love that took the fear away
[1:22:33] and God seen me
[1:22:35] through did you hear it was love that
[1:22:37] took the fear away fear was there but
[1:22:40] fear can't stand in the presence of
[1:22:43] divine
[1:22:44] love fear had to back up is that right
[1:22:49] Amen in another place brother random
[1:22:51] talking about when that you know those
[1:22:53] Hornets came in the message love 1956 he
[1:22:56] says when th those Hornets had covered
[1:22:58] him over he said instead of being scared
[1:23:01] love come in and took its place now
[1:23:05] where did that love come from that love
[1:23:07] was already
[1:23:08] there but it was surrendering to the
[1:23:11] love of God that was in his
[1:23:14] heart it was the love of God coming in
[1:23:17] and coming forth it was invited the love
[1:23:19] of God was invited into the situation do
[1:23:22] you realize this is why the prophet
[1:23:24] would say this over and over through the
[1:23:26] message oh I wish I could live in that
[1:23:27] atmosphere all the time oh I wish I
[1:23:29] could walk in that atmosphere all the
[1:23:31] time because I love you you know how it
[1:23:33] comes in I've been in situations where
[1:23:35] my is such disagreement and I've just
[1:23:37] sensed his presence come right down and
[1:23:40] my it's everything is under control not
[1:23:42] my control but the control of divine
[1:23:45] love and it's such a peace it's such a
[1:23:47] rest that's what the prophet was talking
[1:23:49] about love came in and fear was gone
[1:23:57] amen let me just say this to you and to
[1:24:01] understand when we look at this
[1:24:04] sometimes we have to come back to these
[1:24:05] places to understand brother brandham
[1:24:08] lived a consecrated
[1:24:12] life are you hearing me now listen God's
[1:24:15] not called you nor
[1:24:17] me to do what brother Bram did that was
[1:24:20] the office God called him to do right
[1:24:23] but God's called us to be consecrated as
[1:24:27] Believers and as we remember Jude said
[1:24:29] keep yourselves in the love of God is
[1:24:32] that right so staying in that place to
[1:24:36] where love there's a place where Love
[1:24:38] Can can come on the scene fear can be
[1:24:41] done away because you know what fear
[1:24:42] would have caused fear would have caused
[1:24:44] brother Braham to do when he was
[1:24:45] thinking those thoughts in that Maniac
[1:24:46] he sized him up right right he was a
[1:24:50] boxer sized him up what was doing that
[1:24:52] fear
[1:24:54] right but he said I chose to think
[1:24:57] different thoughts and the kind of
[1:24:59] thoughts he started to look at is no
[1:25:01] doubt he said this is a good this is a
[1:25:03] good man he don't want to be this way no
[1:25:05] doubt he's got a family at home notice
[1:25:07] he starts entering in he starts
[1:25:09] interceding that man did not deserve if
[1:25:11] we'll look at it in what's being
[1:25:13] deserved he didn't deserve
[1:25:15] interceding but you see what was it it
[1:25:18] was the spirit of Christ that was having
[1:25:22] the right away to intercede for that man
[1:25:25] and it
[1:25:26] overcame Hallelujah that devil not the
[1:25:30] man the devil cuz remember remember when
[1:25:33] he fell across brother bram's feet the
[1:25:36] holy spirit said because you've accepted
[1:25:39] because you've challenged the Holy
[1:25:40] Spirit you'll fall across my feet the
[1:25:42] Holy Ghost feet that night was brother
[1:25:45] brandom's and remember when those out
[1:25:48] there there were in CS there were many
[1:25:51] that were sick and they were bound and
[1:25:53] and all kinds of afflictions and the
[1:25:55] prophet said when that happened they got
[1:25:58] up off the cops got out of the
[1:25:59] wheelchairs sickness left cuz they saw
[1:26:02] their Chief demon Was Defeated
[1:26:09] Hall it took the strength right out of
[1:26:14] them my thank you Lord so here we find
[1:26:17] it this is why David would say in Psalms
[1:26:20] 56:3 what time I am afraid I will trust
[1:26:23] in thee in God I will praise His word in
[1:26:26] God I have put my trust I will not fear
[1:26:29] what flesh can do unto me that's so good
[1:26:33] Hallelujah this is why then when we look
[1:26:36] at it and understanding fear one of the
[1:26:39] studies that was done to me I I look at
[1:26:42] these things I read it I think my
[1:26:43] goodness these are things that's
[1:26:45] happened down through the scriptures and
[1:26:46] it it says it like this just just bear
[1:26:48] with me it just one of the things it is
[1:26:50] one of fear sneakiest tricks is
[1:26:52] convincing us that the realm of
[1:26:54] possibility is more limited than what it
[1:26:57] really is that's good you remember the
[1:27:00] spies we're not able the realm of
[1:27:03] possibility was so
[1:27:05] limited but oh you let God take a hold
[1:27:08] of it and you look at like David David
[1:27:11] here is staring this big giant and
[1:27:14] David's look at him the rest of the
[1:27:15] Army's trembling in fear and David looks
[1:27:18] at him and says how can you miss
[1:27:21] him
[1:27:22] amen fear
[1:27:24] Faith finds things that fear will never
[1:27:27] ever
[1:27:28] see but faith will let you see the
[1:27:31] enemies a vulnerability the in his
[1:27:34] armor it'll let you see look the rest of
[1:27:37] them nobody else ever said he's an
[1:27:39] uncircumcised Philistine that's the
[1:27:41] first thing David called out and said
[1:27:43] who is this uncircumcised Philistine he
[1:27:46] realized I got a covenant with a
[1:27:48] covenant keeping God I know God by an
[1:27:50] experience this guy does not have a
[1:27:53] covenant
[1:27:57] Hallelujah the possibilities where the
[1:28:00] rest of them said how in the world can
[1:28:02] we overcome this David said how can
[1:28:07] we God is on our side this is the
[1:28:11] shortest guy in the
[1:28:14] bunch right no doubt David's wearing
[1:28:17] osers out there to the battle shortest
[1:28:19] guy in the
[1:28:21] bunch but he want about the size of the
[1:28:24] man he had allowed God to take over in
[1:28:28] his
[1:28:30] life the realm of possibility it wasn't
[1:28:34] a narrow thing the realm became wide
[1:28:40] open
[1:28:42] Hallelujah because that that that fear
[1:28:45] the illusion of fear it'll cause us to
[1:28:47] pull back from
[1:28:49] things it'll cause us to pull back from
[1:28:52] things it can actually create even what
[1:28:54] what what some of these in the study say
[1:28:56] fear of rejection and it'll just pull
[1:28:57] cause people to pull back I'm afraid of
[1:28:59] being rejected I'm afraid of being
[1:29:00] turned down I'm afraid they won't like
[1:29:02] me I'm afraid this right here those are
[1:29:03] real
[1:29:04] fears are you hearing me now just stay
[1:29:07] with me a minute God has never left you
[1:29:10] nor me as his children to just resolve
[1:29:13] our own fears that's right God said when
[1:29:16] things come up I'm going to be right
[1:29:17] there as a faithful parent and we're
[1:29:18] going to walk through this I want you to
[1:29:21] remember of who I have made you who it
[1:29:24] is that has called you come on now
[1:29:27] Hallelujah but you see sometimes it'll
[1:29:29] talk about of how that when a person
[1:29:32] comes into uh you know like fear and
[1:29:35] it'll be it could be passed on it says
[1:29:37] once you're raised in a Culture of Fear
[1:29:39] like that fear throughout daily lives
[1:29:41] poor it becomes poor mental and physical
[1:29:44] health because of it and and and people
[1:29:46] begin to leave fear driven lives and and
[1:29:49] children follow suit fear is contagious
[1:29:51] and we transmit it to the ones we love
[1:29:53] most that happened when those spies came
[1:29:56] back 10 of them brought up an evil
[1:29:59] report and it spread like
[1:30:01] wildfire they they started posting as
[1:30:04] soon as they got
[1:30:05] back we saw this and we saw that it
[1:30:09] spread and the Bible says the people
[1:30:12] were wailing outside of their tents as a
[1:30:14] matter of fact they had so received and
[1:30:18] fear had so gripped them they were ready
[1:30:20] to Stone Caleb and Joshua yeah that's
[1:30:23] right were there to encourage
[1:30:25] them hey if God be for us they're bread
[1:30:30] for
[1:30:32] usall are you hearing me now let's look
[1:30:35] at this here just a moment I got a few
[1:30:37] more minutes Deuteronomy 7:1 17 let's
[1:30:40] just let's just bring this down in
[1:30:42] realities of where we walk notice when
[1:30:44] they come into the land God has given
[1:30:46] them some direction God never said when
[1:30:48] you cross the River Jordan let me tell
[1:30:50] you something soon as you cross the
[1:30:51] River Jordan you'll never have a bit of
[1:30:53] fear
[1:30:55] soon as you're circumcised on the other
[1:30:57] side you'll never be fear come along God
[1:31:00] never said that
[1:31:03] am right God never said that God's word
[1:31:06] always stays true yes amen are you with
[1:31:09] me God God there's a lot I could say
[1:31:12] within that God don't need to God
[1:31:14] doesn't need to add to make himself
[1:31:16] something am he is his word that's
[1:31:21] notice in verse 17 if Thou shalt say in
[1:31:23] thine heart these nations are more than
[1:31:26] I how can I dispossess them do you
[1:31:28] notice if Thou shalt say in thy heart as
[1:31:30] a man thinketh in his heart so is he but
[1:31:33] God don't say you've already thought it
[1:31:35] in your heart watch this watch how God's
[1:31:37] approach Thou shalt not be afraid of
[1:31:39] them but shal well remember what the
[1:31:43] Lord thy God did unto pharaoh and unto
[1:31:45] all Egypt come on you you you're looking
[1:31:49] at that but I'm going to take you back
[1:31:51] in your memory and remind you of what
[1:31:54] you did but what God
[1:31:57] did the great Temptations which Thine
[1:32:00] Eyes saw the signs the Wonders the
[1:32:03] mighty hand the stretched out arm hey
[1:32:05] look they didn't have to look no further
[1:32:06] than their own bodies their shoes hadn't
[1:32:08] worn out their clothes had not become
[1:32:10] threadbear God had provided water God
[1:32:13] had provided Mana God had provided
[1:32:15] everything plus all the all of the great
[1:32:18] signs and wonders that were
[1:32:22] done whereby the Lord thy God brought
[1:32:25] thee out so shall the Lord thy God do
[1:32:27] unto all the people of whom Thou Art
[1:32:30] afraid moreover the Lord thy God will
[1:32:32] send the Hornet among them until that
[1:32:35] they are left till until they they that
[1:32:37] are left hide themselves from thee and
[1:32:40] be destroyed Thou shalt not be
[1:32:42] frightened at them for the Lord thy God
[1:32:45] is among you a mighty God and terrible
[1:32:47] what is he doing he's taking their
[1:32:49] attention away from what they're looking
[1:32:52] at as if Thou shalt saying this heart
[1:32:55] that these nations are mightier than I
[1:32:57] I'm going to take your attention and put
[1:32:59] it back where it belongs it is I the
[1:33:02] Lord that I brought me
[1:33:07] here and the Lord thy God will put out
[1:33:10] those Nations before thee by little and
[1:33:13] little down that thou mayest not consume
[1:33:16] them at once lest the Beast of the
[1:33:17] fields increase upon thee but the Lord
[1:33:19] thy God shall deliver them unto thee and
[1:33:22] shall destroy them with a mighty
[1:33:23] destruction until they be destroyed and
[1:33:26] he shall deliver their kings into thine
[1:33:30] hand and thou shalt destroy their name
[1:33:33] from under heaven I'm telling you I'm
[1:33:34] looking at spiritual kings that have
[1:33:36] been called to take care of these Kings
[1:33:40] in that spirit world let me tell you
[1:33:42] something where at one time the enemy
[1:33:44] once ruled your life with a certain ho
[1:33:46] now you are no longer under him but you
[1:33:49] are now ruling over that which once
[1:33:51] ruled you
[1:33:53] [Music]
[1:33:55] hallelujah what is it Kings have been
[1:33:57] delivered into your hand spirits of lust
[1:34:00] spirits of all these other things all
[1:34:02] they have been delivered and brought
[1:34:04] subject to what to the name of Jesus
[1:34:06] Christ Hallelujah his name is magnified
[1:34:10] in your
[1:34:14] life God told him in verse 25 the Graven
[1:34:17] image of their gods burn them with fire
[1:34:20] Thou shalt not desire the silver or gold
[1:34:22] that's on them don't take it lest thou
[1:34:25] be snared therein it's an Abomination to
[1:34:28] the Lord thy God neither shalt thou
[1:34:30] bring an Abomination into thine house
[1:34:32] lest thou be a cursed thing like it but
[1:34:34] Thou shalt utterly detest it and thou
[1:34:36] shalt utterly abort it for it's a cursed
[1:34:38] thing who was it that set the standard
[1:34:41] for what's cursed and what's not God
[1:34:44] that's right God's word set the standard
[1:34:47] is that right but you remember as long
[1:34:50] as Israel when they entered the land as
[1:34:53] long as they kept the word of God before
[1:34:55] him it was the ark that went before him
[1:34:58] the priest carrying it and the word here
[1:35:01] at the Jordan was open they were to
[1:35:03] follow the word into battle God would
[1:35:05] give them the battle plan would give
[1:35:07] them Direction you know God would give
[1:35:10] them Direction when they were going into
[1:35:12] Jericho I want you to burn everything I
[1:35:16] don't want nothing taken out of it but
[1:35:18] you know it would be it would be a time
[1:35:22] later that God would permit him to take
[1:35:24] the
[1:35:25] gold sometimes it's just waiting on
[1:35:28] God's Will and God's
[1:35:30] timing and God allowed that test to come
[1:35:33] but as long as Israel would keep the
[1:35:36] word before him they would keep the word
[1:35:38] above their ideas their opinions
[1:35:41] thoughts and actions and in their heart
[1:35:43] they were
[1:35:44] victorious but when they took what was
[1:35:46] forbidden it hindered them it stopped
[1:35:50] them they did not have perfect faith
[1:35:53] right to
[1:35:55] move they
[1:35:57] ran they ran from their enemies their
[1:36:00] strength was obedience to the word of
[1:36:02] God this is why I want you to say that
[1:36:05] the prophet would talk about one of the
[1:36:07] greatest curses he says among the
[1:36:09] church's fear he said you don't know who
[1:36:11] you are that's he says you know he says
[1:36:15] you're scared to death about about
[1:36:17] you're scared to death about so many
[1:36:19] things but if you realize who you are he
[1:36:21] said you don't know who you are you
[1:36:22] don't know who is sitting next to you oh
[1:36:24] that's my neighbor I I know him real
[1:36:26] well but he's a Son of God adopted by
[1:36:30] Jesus Christ into the family that's a
[1:36:32] daughter of God sitting next to you and
[1:36:34] who are you if you're a Christian
[1:36:36] believer you're a son and daughter of
[1:36:38] God what are you scared about no need of
[1:36:40] being scared as long as the devil can
[1:36:44] keep you scared that's all he wants to
[1:36:47] do he's got you right
[1:36:50] then if he can just keep you scared yeah
[1:36:55] Hallelujah my my let me just let me read
[1:36:57] one more place here God tells them in
[1:37:00] another place here's in in Deuteronomy
[1:37:02] 20
[1:37:04] verse1 when thou goest out to battle and
[1:37:06] against thine enemies see horses
[1:37:08] chariots and people more than thou be
[1:37:10] not afraid of them for the Lord thy God
[1:37:12] is with thee which brought thee up out
[1:37:15] of the land of Egypt and it shall be
[1:37:18] when ye are come nigh un the battle that
[1:37:20] the priest shall approach and speak un
[1:37:23] unto the children and unto the people
[1:37:25] and say here o Israel approach this day
[1:37:28] unto battle against your enemies let not
[1:37:30] your hearts faint fear not and do not
[1:37:32] tremble neither be you terrified how
[1:37:35] much how many ways can you say don't be
[1:37:38] afraid because of them notice God would
[1:37:42] have a priest a spokesman one that when
[1:37:46] the battle would come notice the priest
[1:37:48] was never uh sounding a trumpet of
[1:37:51] retreat it was always go
[1:37:55] forward go
[1:37:57] forward for the Lord your God is he that
[1:38:00] goeth with you to fight for you against
[1:38:04] your enemies to save you thank see this
[1:38:07] is an
[1:38:08] application that's not just spiritual
[1:38:10] but it's also as parents as parents we
[1:38:13] can take the hands of our children
[1:38:14] spouses one to another as one believer
[1:38:17] to another encouraging one another of
[1:38:20] the things sometimes that that we may
[1:38:22] not understand understand what what the
[1:38:24] situations and what's being done but God
[1:38:27] God brought them into these situations
[1:38:29] but he reminded them I'm right here with
[1:38:33] you amen are you with me God didn't keep
[1:38:36] them back from uncomfortable situations
[1:38:38] he was right there and it says I'm right
[1:38:40] here with
[1:38:42] you
[1:38:43] right oh my you know as I look through
[1:38:47] the Book of Joshua I'll just close on
[1:38:49] this I don't know if you've ever looked
[1:38:51] at it but to me as I've gone through
[1:38:54] even in the Book of Joshua you look how
[1:38:56] many times not just in the first chapter
[1:38:58] but throughout the Book of Joshua how
[1:39:01] many times that God would speak to
[1:39:04] Joshua fear not be Not
[1:39:07] Afraid many chapters it would happen in
[1:39:11] that way you know what God was showing
[1:39:14] you always when situations are put
[1:39:16] before us fear can be there to want to
[1:39:19] come to paralyze us but God always sends
[1:39:22] his word word right on time to meet the
[1:39:26] need for that moment and I'm grateful
[1:39:28] for it I'm grateful that God will send
[1:39:30] his word to where it all of a sudden
[1:39:33] maybe I've got my thoughts are going
[1:39:34] down a line and you know it's somehow
[1:39:36] Satan can get a hold of quotes and
[1:39:38] scriptures and he can nearly run you in
[1:39:39] the ground but you know when God takes a
[1:39:42] hold of that God might take a hold of it
[1:39:44] right through an anointed gift my maybe
[1:39:46] you're sitting listening to the prophet
[1:39:48] or or here you are listening to a man of
[1:39:50] God Minister and all of a sudden you're
[1:39:51] like I I just heard those quotes but he
[1:39:53] he he wasn't sounding like that before I
[1:39:56] just heard those scriptures you know
[1:39:57] what's the difference it's the anointing
[1:40:00] that's handling that word it's a word
[1:40:02] that's reminding you of who you are that
[1:40:05] even despite your circumstances you're a
[1:40:08] son and daughter of God and there is a
[1:40:11] way for
[1:40:13] victory
[1:40:15] Hallelujah am after it was all said and
[1:40:17] done and they came to AI after achen was
[1:40:20] cleared out then God would tell Joshua
[1:40:22] fear not and don't be dismayed but go on
[1:40:25] up to AI right it's yours it's in your
[1:40:28] hands let's
[1:40:38] stand let me just make this reference in
[1:40:41] in another place in
[1:40:43] Joshua a group of kings came
[1:40:46] together they came and all of their
[1:40:49] companies and they were as grasshoppers
[1:40:51] they were they were gathered together in
[1:40:53] a high place Miram m e r o
[1:40:58] m no wonder you know when you think the
[1:41:01] devil took Jesus up to a high mountain
[1:41:07] right you know Paul said we war against
[1:41:11] spiritual wickedness in high places
[1:41:14] right Paul would also write in Romans 8
[1:41:17] that neither height nor depth can
[1:41:22] separate us from the love of God Satan
[1:41:24] likes to try to present as though he's
[1:41:27] got an
[1:41:28] advantage that's
[1:41:30] good but
[1:41:32] listen with God on your
[1:41:36] side the advantage belongs to
[1:41:41] you if God be for us who can be against
[1:41:46] us it was on a high place maybe they had
[1:41:49] to they were looking and seeing them
[1:41:50] they were all gathered is it somehow you
[1:41:52] know they
[1:41:53] Satan makes way that he could they could
[1:41:55] just see see it
[1:41:57] all
[1:41:58] yeah they've already been through battle
[1:42:00] at their battle they've already come
[1:42:01] through Jericho already come through AI
[1:42:03] they've come through many places already
[1:42:06] right and God is telling Joshua even at
[1:42:08] this time in Joshua 11 fear not don't be
[1:42:12] afraid for tomorrow I'll deliver them
[1:42:16] into your hand
[1:42:17] right so what should I do tonight just
[1:42:20] go and rest
[1:42:23] just go lay down and rest Glory just

[1:45:56] would refer to the Holy Spirit as the
[1:45:57] enforcer of God's word and he said let

[1:53:48] all that but my wife was really sick is
[1:53:50] what I'm trying to tell you a lot of you
[1:53:53] remember
[1:53:54] that she was whiter than these
[1:53:58] walls she did not have strength in her
[1:54:02] [Music]
[1:54:04] body and there was a fear that had set
[1:54:07] in after
[1:54:10] that about not wanting to have a
[1:54:14] fear of having any more
[1:54:18] children that fear was real she didn't
[1:54:21] she didn't talk talk about it but it was
[1:54:25] there but one day if I don't get all
[1:54:28] this details right she can come and tell
[1:54:30] it at a different time but one day you
[1:54:33] know my wife she'll a lot of times I
