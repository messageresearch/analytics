in our hearts I need you Lord I need more of you you'll find over and over through the messaging many things just over the years and some things that just been pondering just looking at here even brother Branham you'll find him asking God lord I want more of that super sense Lord I Want More Love [Music] I want more of the Holy Ghost I want more faith because there's more to be had and we want to we're we're taking this mountain there's more there's more we feel that drawing in that that pull in our lives and you know sometimes situations even that that arise show us and what it shows is there's more of God for us there's more of God for us I just we just want to invite him tonight no matter what your need might be let's just let's just invite him and say brother Samuel this is a Thursday night service well Jesus doesn't know the difference between Thursday and Sunday and I'm glad about that I'm glad he don't make a difference let's just invite him say Lord just draw near you know what I have need Heavenly Father we love you Lord Jesus there's been songs that Lord have been expressed and sung here tonight that God though you could move upon a writer by inspiration and they would write words Lord and it would describe Lord what it is that they felt in their heart experiences the Lord that they have went through Lord and father tonight Lord we're not singing these songs from somebody else's experience but it's personal to us Lord Nobody Loves Me Like You Love Me Jesus Lord you're worthy o God of all praise and surely the goodness and mercy of God has followed me all the days of my life oh God it's personal Lord and we just love you Lord tonight we Lord take this moment Lord we want you to be welcome here Lord we want you to the Lord be welcome Lord to just speak to our hearts in a personal way we need more of you Lord may you just come Lord I pray and move speaker and hearer just outside Lord out of the way that you can have the right of way here tonight Lord Lord for every need that's gathered here we we go ahead and we commit it into your hands and Lord we invite you Lord because I'm sure the way that Lord the outcome that it would be the solution to it we know it's always you but I'm sure Lord it'll never be in the way that we're thinking Lord but God it will always be you Lord and we just ask that you would just come Lord in a special way no matter what the need or the circumstance is your god and your greater Lord you are the almighty God and Lord we just invite you tonight Lord have your way father in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen amen amen don't you love him amen let's look here in the scriptures in First Corinthians chapter 12 and verse 31. I'll just read one verse of scripture and we'll let you have your seats to be with you this evening and amen good to see different ones I know that uh were sick and able to be back here with us good to have brother Dave senior back here with us Dave Jr has been with us but it's good to have brother Dave senior here with us continue to keep sister Shirley in prayer and good to have uh brother Ryan and sister Rachel here back with us too they've went through a battle and so we just um we're so thankful it's you know it's good to feel good how many are thankful for that sometimes when you don't feel well boy it's good to feel good you know uh verse verse 31 here we'll read this and let you have your seats Paul said but covet earnestly the best gifts now Paul's just wrote the expression of the body the working of the Holy Spirit through many different gifts and Avenues in the body and it's a glorious thing as you see God moving supernaturally through those gifts and through his body that's something that as the body Believers we desire to see and that's where uh just like brother random puts it in the rising of the sun he says this is our desire is to see him glorified I said we don't want to see a church or anyone he said we want to see him glorified and so Paul here in the uh ending of this chapter but covet earnestly the best gifts and yet show I unto you a more excellent way amen may God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I want to just I want to just speak here on just a few moments on just a thought on yielding to Divine love because when we look at a useful life and knowing that as God used job in a very very special way we know it was a useful life as the prophet put it that he had been used of God and he had given himself to the Lord there's always a battle Satan is always coming in every way to in some way hinder the Avenue and the channels in our lives he can't stop God's word from being fulfilled but Satan busies himself just like a beaver would try to Dam up an area to keep water from flowing and Satan Works within that to try to hinder and this is where Paul is speaking to the Believers that the gifts are truly is something that was we see and the Supernatural and gone moving but Paul is also letting him know that don't underestimate this but as a matter of fact let this be what your focus is because if Divine love is not your focus then the gifts themselves are under the governance of what so it brings us to this place that everything in in everything concerning our lives in the church and our home and on and on it should be governed by love I I want my actions governed by love I want my attitude governed by love and that's something that just doesn't take place but if you see here tonight there's ways that we can place ourselves I believe that all through this building here tonight we can all say hey I want to have the advantage on this tonight I want to have the advantage and I believe God comes to speak to us so that we would have the advantage and the upper hand because the scripture has said very clearly and you realize in your heart if God before us who can be against us but to recognize that these are things that God is putting before us I show unto you a more excellent way so it's a way that's being set before us just like when God would open the way to Moses and he would show the way to Israel it wasn't the way that Israel journeyed was not necessarily what the man or we in our flesh or Israel would have chose but God knew what they were able to handle at certain times God knew that the Red Sea that that moment they would never have chose that you or I would never have chose the Red Sea but you see in every situation God is working and our testimony is being built and it's being built so that our faith rests upon the power of almighty God the only thing Israel had to do is yield to the word of God and when Moses spoke the word and the Red Sea was parted they walked through in obedience to the word that had been spoken God took care of their enemies God took care of everything else that was pursuing them God was just letting it be known that I'm the one who makes the way and if you just walk in my way I will open what needs to be opened I I'll take care of what needs to be taken care of and that really boils down to just trust and so as we think about the presence of God and his presence it manifests his character and his ways to us one of the things that brother Branham would point out in even a year prior to the opening of the seals and he would speak of how that all that God might come and open those those uh those seals to us and he says and when he does he said what it will be is a revealing of his divine nature and his character because there's only so much that a man a man can probe into but when God reveals himself in his fullness of his person of who he really is then he doesn't need a man to speak or to try to describe but God is there to make himself known his character and that's why that in our lives we are not called nor did God do it in a manner so that we would try to imitate brother Branham or someone else but God was letting us see that through this vessel that is yielded to me if you will yield to me no matter what your battles no matter what the situation even through all of the stages of maturity I will make a way for you so when we read these scriptures I'm going to go into First Corinthians 13 4 I want you to remember this as we read these scriptures that this is God's own character and life being made manifest through our lives as the children of God is that okay when we read these scriptures here that we're going to read in First Corinthians 13 4. we read them last week and I want to just start back into this and so it's not it's God's own character his life being made manifest you or I are the channels that God can pour himself into and make himself known through in our lives and so it brings it to this point if we just lay this for the background that you'll actually go through the whole message tonight and seeing it through this this perspective and that is it is in our trying or our striving but it's our yielding to him it's our yielding to him now in First Corinthians 13 4 here it says charity now this this charity this is God God is love this this scriptures that we're reading is not scriptures that a person can climb up and attain to outside of the Holy Ghost dwelling inside of you because that's what it is it's not a work of man this is the holy spirit man can love God in his spirit with feel your love but this is agape love this is the Holy Ghost operating through a surrender life and a vessel it's God taking us on so I want you to think of it it's not you it's not me it's God displaying himself charity suffereth law and this kind charity envious not charity vonneth not itself and is not puffed up it does not behave itself unseemly it seeketh not her own is not easily provoked and it thanketh no evil and you know that means to keep records and everything else rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth it doesn't matter if someone disagrees with you or not the objective is is I want truth to prevail and when I'm talking about truth I'm talking about the person of Truth himself I want to see righteousness prevail I want to see anybody fail I don't want to see anybody miss it if we have that attitude then we're falling off of what God is calling us to so it's sending the desire within us that look uh you know let me just say it like this uh the only the only place that you'll probably ever go that everybody agrees with you is a graveyard and that's because nobody can talk but here we are assembled together and you know what God's God's placed it in such a way oh I'm going to find a church that suits me or do we mean that I'm going to find a place that everybody thinks like I think agree like I agree good luck with that you can't even do that in your own home come on now but you see God designed it and said it that way for what purpose to show greenness in our life that we must have the sun to bake out all the greenness in our life Hallelujah oh my verse 7. beareth all things this is what it does it Bears all things believes all things hopes all things endures all things we were looking at that verse last week it just comes to my mind that's where you want I want to believe the best about a person yeah but the same you might be wrong so be it so be it oh you're wrong about this but I want to believe the best for somebody [Applause] is that right that's what that's how our lives should be well so and so I don't care what so-and-so said all right are you hearing me we're talking listen we're talking about being stewards of the grace of God and there's things that you and I have stewards over I've got stewards over be careful little ears what you hear we're gonna have to break out the Sunday School Song now do we but I tell you what it behooves us sometimes be careful little ears what you hear be careful little eyes what you see be careful little mouth what you say whoo charity I love this charity never fail us but where there be prophecies they shall fail to serve the purpose whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish okay now I I brother random makes this statement and I played this before the service and I want this is to me at the end of the service here in Divine in the message love and brother Ram is talking about the atmosphere that is coming to the building he's calling the people's attention that the atmosphere that they are sensing in right there at that moment in the meeting is different from when they walked in the building and and he's letting them know that what it is it's God projecting his love right now and he said it is the angels of God that are moving up and down the aisles now remember you say oh praise God the angels of God remember brother random tells us regarding Zacharias and Elizabeth who was John the Baptist parents he said it was an angel that visited them and in the Bible brother and said notice in the Bible it says that they were an upright people and he said if you want God to visit your home he said just as you entertain in your life in your walk with God you live an upright in life before God does that mean that you're mistake free no but it means that you recognize I've got an atonement and nothing has to linger or is going to linger I'm not going to let one Speck 11 build and build and build but we're going to take care of it yes we're in this flesh but it's not an excuse I want my place my whole my life to be a place that the holy spirit is welcome [Applause] oh my brother Brian said this I'm so happy and thinking of this I don't have this one listed there but I just want to refer to it and thinking of Charity never fail us I love this he said so happy that we can introduce to a dying shaking World under the impact of an atomic age Cobalt bombs sin but introduce a love that can never be stopped by any bomb or anything that's the power the power of divine love oh brother Samuel it's not working charity never fails are you hearing me the breakdown is not in Divine love the breakdown becomes with the instrument that Divine love is trying to be projected through it's us that want to keep ourselves as an instrument that Divine love can flow through is that right so we know that when we see this uh brother Branham even goes on in that quote there and I just I'm just referring to us I don't have it on the screen but he says and one he says here he is right now he's talking to the people at the end of the service here he is right now and his love is spreading forth and that's what makes you feel his love is spreading forth that's when it comes down to it it's God's love drawing Upon Our Lives now you and I have a choice we can either surrender to it I believe that's why Satan wants people to be so busy just check into church like we're checking in on the clock and check out I did my duty but that's not how we're to come to the house of God we're to be sensitive because maybe God wants to do something in your life is that right but God knows how to get attention to where it comes to a place that there's things that we are not going to be able to punch in and punch out we are going to have to labor and be desperate before God God knows how to bring us as his children into this place and I I just say if we can just go ahead and give ourselves to it but you know what I don't want to live my life in that way I don't want to just say God you got this time to work with me by this time I'm gone see ya I don't want to live that kind of life you say why because that is a life that's under the influence of the world come on friends we're talking about Sons and Daughters of God either the world is going to control you or you're going to control it is that right it's just like with everything in your life either you will be a master over it or it will Master you brother Brian said he's here right now and his love is spreading forth that's what makes you feel the way you do he's projecting his love to you now come here and he will show you his grace he will take all your sin away all your worry away all that's wrong with you he will make it all right so it comes down to yielding to the presence of almighty God now when you think of it it's yielding to the love of God being projected to us I I referred to a scripture last week of how that the Bible says that the love of Christ constrainteth us and that word constraineth as we looked at it last week it means to direct us to guide us to lead us I'm thankful for the leadership of the Holy Spirit see God's a father are you hearing me now God don't birth his children and say raise yourself the Bible said that a child left to itself bringeth its mother shame God is purposeful in raising and maturing his church brother man tells us like this taken Hebrews chapter 12 as in speaking of how that those who are born of his Spirit were are then after being born of his Spirit are trained to conform to His Image in their walk I'm glad he's a faithful teacher I'm glad he's there that God just didn't step back and say well you know what we're going to put you on autopilot you've been born again God doesn't work that way he doesn't even call you to work that way but he speaks to you and I and says mortify the Deeds of your body he lets us know there's a Warfare that goes on the spirit lusteth against the Flesh and the flesh against the spirit it's a Battleground that is going on is that right so we see there is a constraining by the love of God and to remember we have been bought with a price we're not our own is that right I mean there's some things that we can look at and say hey man I need God to take this well don't just let God have this problem or have this and have this situation and then tell him and other things hey I got this I know how to handle people preach with me now preach with me now I got this God I know how to do it but maybe what God is wanting and he's going to do is display the grace of God to where you step back and say wow I didn't even realize that that was in me in that way and watched the supernatural take place my day is something you're talking about walking on water sometimes I wonder if our Ambitions are on things that we'll never do come on now if God wanted you to walk on water then he'd have you walking on water but in the meantime he's calling you and I to walk over our first bird he's calling on us to tread over our feelings tread over our attitude to walk above that how can I do it Lord because he has Biden us to come and follow him so it's the love of God constraining us which is to control us I'm glad about that aren't you it's urging us we don't know what urging is we sometimes we have it in our homes wives there's the urge the husbands husbands urge the wise and who's been in that wall a little bit huh urging boy this is pain it looked awful nice on these walls urging sorry I don't mean to bring up bad things but you get what I'm saying the love of God controlling urging us see notice he it's not God going to say well I'm just going to override you no he's controlling us he's direct and urging us impelling us in the right direction and this is where that when we see this word Consecration and I really want to just step into that word tonight on the word consecration because when you think of this word consecration it's a word that means where something has been dedicated for a certain purpose like this church is consecrated for service dude we don't you know this church is not just well when we're not having service it becomes a multi-faceted room you know we're playing kickball and don't know this is a place that's been set aside for us for God to come down and meet with us and speak to us we've dedicated it that way we've dedicated that and dedicate our lives that way so if we think about how certain things can be dedicated in a certain way then it brings it down for our lives to where our lives if what we dedicate ourselves to that's where consecration is and I want you to remember brother random talking about the bull I'm just going to read some simple things here but there's some points in here that I will I'm just looking for the Lord to just draw and minister to us and he's talking about this bull that was there in the field when he walked upon it and he didn't Brothers didn't even know that that bull was there he didn't know matter of fact the last time he had heard about it was that bull was down on a different farm and remember it had actually killed a black man it had killed him so brother random you know now knowing he walks he walks across here and brother Brandon said here he come and something happened I wish that would happen all the time it just don't do it but when I see a real tremendous sick case and something happens now notice when I see a real tremendous sick taste so he sees a need and when he sees that need as it begins to enter in on that need that's there what does it do he says something happens it isn't it isn't man he said it's not man it's when God can get a hold of a man it's when it's consecrated that's what I want to be it's consecrated and God won't do that for me the pastor won't do that for me can I say this the Holy Ghost won't do that for me that's on me and you being consecrated to dedicate Hey listen you and I to work we have a choice of what we dedicate ourselves to yeah you know what he said by dedicate when we give our substitute when we place as a higher priority above something else that's what we dedicate ourselves to the holy spirit will not consecrate or do this for us but it will yield to him he'll lead us into a deeper Consecration and let me tell you something it's greater than just Bulls or Maniacs or Hornets but it will produce the love of God in your home it'll take situations on the job it will give you victory in your life brother said what's on the platform when the Visions happen what's when evil spirits what's what takes place it's a surrender to the Holy Spirit now see brother random could have just no he could have refused Divine love is coming in Divine love just didn't take brother Adam and put him if I can say this way you know put him in a full nelson or how you know or a headlock or you know a cradle mood he didn't come in and do that to him let me go let me go no but he had to surrender remember the Holy Spirit is a gentleman he's a gentleman and brother Branham had to surrender to him in other words to let Divine love have the right of way right it's kind of like those yield signs that they have getting on that nobody pays attention to yield means go faster and cut everybody else off come on you know what I'm talking about right so but yielding itself is where you're trying to merge in to the traffic so it's not us putting ourselves in the Forefront but with sins here is God's presence moving down and it's overriding our feelings it's overriding our thoughts come on friends we need the grace of God we need Divine love to step in in this moment that's not unchristianizing you that's letting you see of the resource that you and I have within us Satan will inject the thought and then turn around and accuse you for thinking it preach with me now he'll turn around and do that what's he doing anointing that old flesh what's he doing he knows if he can get at you that the yielding will shut down but if you can remember I am nothing without the grace of God and that thought came in but I dismissed that in the name of Jesus Christ talking about battling against spirits he comes in and takes over watch how he controls it just watch how it takes place it's God it's not man oh if we don't mean living that God let us live there oh my I want to be welcoming don't you notice Brethren said the Bull's standing there about 20 yards from me he rose here and he come great long horns oh brother Pam said This is the End now you'll realize when you read this in and you heard me go through this before brother Brown's thoughts when he begins to come in fear sets in in this moment this is the end of the Bible actually says it in that way in other places in the message this is the end now notice and instead of hating that bull it seems strange I love him notice it seemed strange so it was strange to the prophet standing there right now that he did not even feel angry towards that bull you know what he's letting us know this is not something that I did I did not strive or work myself up and repeat after me 20 million times I do not hate you I do not hate you I do not hate you don't take another no it was him yielding let me just say it like this let me just say this very plainly if he would have knew that bull was in there guess what he wouldn't have walked in there the Bible said not to tempt the Lord come on somebody the bad brother bam tells us Jesus don't clown for nobody [Music] if he'd have known that was there he wouldn't have walked in there Brother Robinson matter of fact if I'd had my gun and it wouldn't have been in my truck I'd have shot him is that right but you see this is God taking over I'm just going to say a plane God did not include this example that he's going to produce amongst the bride a bunch of bull Whispers Hornet Whispers you're like dog Whispers that ain't what God was trying to do who I'm going to be in a wild animal tamer I'm gonna do this and I'm going to do that it's like my dad said when there were different ones that came one to talk about in the Millennium or whatever more and you know the dad said well you go sleep with the lines and we'll find out tomorrow yeah because the Bible said the lion will lay down with the lamb is that right then at that time that's when it'll be if God chooses it sometimes we've been building it out there's experiences through this building right here where some of us would have been bitten by dogs or other things if not the grace of God had stepped into our lives but we didn't work that up [Applause] you see this is not erotic Christian Life a Christian Life is based on rest not but I got to do this and I've got to make this happen this is not what that is at all instead of hating that bull it seemed strange I loved him I wish I could explain it but let me tell you something brother you'll never come in contact with the greater force in this life than love yes sir I do know this is important I do not try to conquer Demons by kicking them how did Jesus do it hold your peace right right and come out he did not kick the objects where the where Satan had him bound yeah hello now I do not try to conquer demons I mean I've been in I've been in the places where I've had to sit on their legs while we prayed for them and and everything in in different meetings and case after case and situations coming but never was anything physically sometimes laboring for that for hours until that Spirit when it's finally exposed and it would leave but here's the thing I don't try to conquer them by kicking them notice well what do you do I love God but wait a minute the demons there how are you overcoming the demon because I love God because I cannot love God if I've got the wrong attitude towards that are you hearing me see Satan wants to draw us out in the flesh instead of hating the bull love is what God is God is love love moves god brother Brown goes on to say and why are people so tossed about he's talking about hearing a man you know standing up at a big tent and you know and and and and things he was talking about casting out evil spirits and this is an important Point brother Rams says I don't have no doubt about that but evil spirits are not cast out by cruel indifferent living the most powerful weapon there is in the world is love remember Satan is the god of force are you hearing me now but God by Divine love God overcomes how did Jesus defeat him in the Temptations by love come on you know I'm quoting to you by look see for us in our mind we're looking by love he loved God he loved the word he loved his father he loved above that situation you say well brother Samuel don't I love if you let down on your character and say well I believe the word but it's okay to act like this you're letting down because remember the word is not a letter but it's a character being revealed sometimes it didn't balance scripture it's about his nature and Satan what he wants to do because as soon as he can draw us out in the flesh I don't care Who We Are we're defeated as soon as he gets you out from behind the Fortress of the word and that's the word in our soul that's the reason of the times that we've had to repent is because we got out from behind that Fortress yeah this is why when brother Brown would go on to say it says when you see he says a person like that and he's talking about that maniac and I'm going to read about that in a minute he said but don't don't never think that it's the man it's the devil that's in the band notice where are we training our sights because all we see is a manifestation but it's not the man it's the devil if Satan can get his eyes what they treat me off for they're doing this or that he's doing this or he's that the way Satan wants is to get our eyes on flesh and blood and it's not about flesh and blood um God help us brother Branson goes on in this he says you never cast The Devil out by the wrong attitude Never by the wrong attitude if there's one little bit of anything in your heart against that person it'll never work one spec clogs up the channel is that right or brother Samuel then how in the world am I going to do that because sometimes I can't help when different things come in you may not be able to help when things come in but you do have jurisdiction over what you let's say there's a lot of people that can come and knock on your door tonight but you've got to be able and willing to let them in right somebody can come in and knock on the door and want to sell you a bunch of junk it's your you're the one that decides whether or not you're going to listen to it and you're going to buy it come on somebody and then you wonder how did this junk end up in my house because you let them in you listen to their spill and you bought it come on listen salespeople are slick I've had them when they find out they kind of probe around a little bit and I've come to her you know you recognize it and because I want to witness to people but I also realize I've been around different ones and want to sell me things and then they'll try to get me on the scripture you know what I'll sit there and witness to you but I ain't going to buy your product if I don't need it now that ain't puffing me up I'm just telling you if I don't need it I don't need it and I don't want it right but you know what I'm saying so you never cast out the Devil by a wrong attitude it takes love to do that Hey listen friends when brother Brandon developed that when that complex was developed he didn't go around and look for a complex come on but here it was after laboring and things being said being misunderstood things going on and notice he said I built myself a complex he never put that on the devil he said I build it but notice what he said he said I've got to stay around here and I have got to pray and seek God and you will find brother Branham after the message standing in the Gap as a matter of fact before he ever preaches standing in the Gap he preaches to a group of young people come follow me and he lets the young people he don't know let the whole cat out of the bag in that service but he lets him know he said I was on the wrong road he said but by his grace I'm back on the right Road you know what it was he was brought to that mountain range and said if you ever doubt come back here your name is wrote all over here oh let me tell you your name is founded in the Lamb's Book of Life if you want to know if God cares about you he's included it his presence makes it real this message is that mountain Reigns for you and I that lets us know when I look in the word of God if I get down if I get gloomy if I get discouraged I can look back through the sacred Sands and know that God has picked me up and revealed himself to me sometimes it's just that it's just that way because it isn't just well I'm going to speak that wrong attitude out of here I believe in speaking the word but sometimes I think sometimes we're wanting things without some real grunting it out in desperation not in not that it's about us but there were times there's times of desperation that God places us into um foreign you feel the feeling leave thank God what are you doing there's ground being gained what do I do keep praying because maybe within uh by the all of a sudden turns around at five o'clock in the evening hear that same feeling wants to come right back in there what do I do pray it right back out well he wants to come back the next day pray it right back out [Applause] [Music] I'm not going to say that it takes love to do that and love is the most powerful force it wasn't nothing wrong or anything like that but I just you know love is the most powerful force that there is in the world have you notice a devil is always hate hate is of the devil when people hate someone remember it's a terrible devil to despise or dislike you mustn't do that you mustn't do that true amen that's right that's right help me Lord Jesus notice brother Brown goes into this I'm talking about the maniac here he says now when it comes to these crisis I'm sure that we might label things in our life and they are crisis what is a crisis is when we need God we need God to move right we need God to move I don't care what it is it's a crisis come on Friends that one's Sovereign Grace now notice when we come to these crisis that's when Sovereign Grace steps in something happened in my life he's talking about that Maniac now I I I wish it would if it ever comes again that it'll never leave I only wish that there was some way that I had power this morning to project to this group of men and women here and he would never leave you like when the maniac at Oregon when he ran to the platform to kill me many of you read the book something happened there you've often wondered I guess how those things happen right you've often wondered it's something in the stead of despising that man though he was there to take my life now remember I think it was I don't know how many weeks ago it was but we took that scripture when it speaks of if they Smite you on the right cheek turn your other cheek right hello y'all didn't go to sleep on me now did you we weren't wearing a big help me Jesus moment right now okay but remember when it says you know if they want to take your uh coat give them your cloak also what the whole the whole objective within that whole realm of scriptures is is don't get caught up in the spirit they're Anointed with and coming at you in because there's times you've got to go to the union on your job and you're not backslid it isn't that well you're not really doubting you're really doubting God if you really have faith hey it's written in the law book it's part of the contract if it's there ain't no need for me to sweat about it talk to the Union steward and let's get things rolling it's talking about not coming under vexation because as soon as you come under the spirit that is being projected to you you're defeated is trying to draw draw us out it's something in the state of despising that man though he was there to take my life I love I just love how it's worded a Divine love set in for him brother did you work it up no were you I need Divine love right now no no it's set in what was it he was welcome he was welcome he was welcome at any time do you see why that the enemy battles your life in my life he wants to make us non-useful that's why he comes at you with the attacks he comes at you don't look at it well well if I could just get this out of the way if this person hadn't said this if this you realize what that's all about it's there to try to shut down the channel but if you can say God I need your grace I need Divine love to set in right now and right here I needed working right here first he called me a hypocrite and a snake in the grass ooh thousands of people sitting there spit in my face brother Brown dramatized that I was Drew back his fist and said I'll break every bone in your body talks about how people were sinned no doubt sitting that are setting out in that meeting we're sitting there but instead of despising the man Grace came in in a moment when I needed it let me tell you something when you and I needed Saving Grace came in [Applause] when we needed it we didn't work ourselves up to it we weren't worthy of it but Grace came when we had need of it I don't believe consecration that God is speaking about tonight is making ourselves worthy or working ourselves up but it's saying God let me be a channel because I don't know the next pasture I walk through there might be a bowl I don't know the next job situation I don't know in my family I don't know in the church I don't know here but in everything Lord I want to be a useful life to you Lord Hallelujah sometimes you might look at it and say well I didn't stop no bull maybe it wasn't a bull you were stumping maybe somebody on the job was watching how you were acting and they look back and say something's different now Dan come and talk to you about it but they've watched you for a while something's different how you're able to endure those things and take those things or because that what they realize is flesh alone can't do that right people can be pushed to a certain place right just how it is I love this next this next part Grace sets in and projected a Divine love into my heart I love that but Ryan I thought it was already in my heart it is but I'm saying it's already there but Grace stepped in when I I couldn't end there was no mustering of the strength I could not do what was called Grace stepped in and projected a Divine love into my heart that I could project to him and thought there stands a man like I am he likes to eat and drink and his family but the devil has him bound so the love of God constrained me and the man humbled himself and fell across my feet Grace stepped in When Love Was projected now was that man changed no Brethren tells us he he never was changed he wasn't delivered because he actually worshiped those spirits that's a whole different different thought but I want you to think about this I loved him now it's not loving the expression brother Graham didn't love to spit rolling down his face brother Ram did not love being called a snake in the grass it was not all I just love that no you don't that that's not being true I loved him what were you loving him that I realized beneath this darkness that is around him there is a real person that would not act this way whether they're Christian or not they would not act this way hallelujah what does that take that takes God it's like the man with the box of chocolates remember his wife was giving him all kinds of problems I know I preached on that for years but you know when every time when he'd come in from a meeting but being with brother random man all of a sudden she'd start and start in on those Pentecostal and it wasn't her it was a spirit right there was influence as she was under no doubt her church what they taught days of Miracles his past and all those other things she was she was under the influence of that but brother Brian remember he would get there out in the middle of the floor and brother said they would spin around and around and around and around him trying to cast that devil off of Brethren told him he said you go about it all the wrong way so sisters if you got a box of chocolates tomorrow that don't mean that you're got spirits on you it just means the husband's another boy I'm gonna butter her up good well not a lot of amens I mean sister should have been shouting praise breaking here or something I mean glory to God sending them amen's preach it brother Samuel but a box of chocolates what was it it was the expression of love you see sometimes when there's needs that we're praying for if it don't happen in the time frame or we don't feel well I don't feel they're still acting this way this is still going on remember charity never faileth oh but it's that no no no no no no this this right here had nothing to do with the bull with the maniac or with the Hornets it had everything to do with a man being consecrated to God and God being able to step in and when God stepped in he just yielded to it it was like stepping right into a channel just just flow with it that's that's how I I wanted to be Lord maybe my feelings or thoughts or where it would be a natural of despising but I want to be able to step into that channel and when the holy spirit moves down just just just run with it just go right with the love of God so attacking anything it'll never get anywhere you can't attack a spirit it won't it won't work that way it's simple care for one another this is where First Corinthians 14 1. let me just try to at least bring it down to this point right here first first Corinthians 14 1 follow after charity and desire spiritual gifts but rather that you may prophesy this is important follow after charity if you're going to follow pursue pursue after make your Pursuit your goal follow after charity oh it is Charity it's not something separate from God is love this is agape love this is God follow after that let that be your focus let him be the focus I want you to think of this this is why it's important on where we're keeping ourselves we are living we are living in a time of great busyness right but sometimes when we can all step back and really step back right now because you see it with young people you see whether that everything all across the board you can go into a restaurant and you see people sitting around a table and they're not even talking come on now we've got to be occupied we've got to be entertained I'm saying it in this manner because there's things that God has given us when we sat around a dinner table when we sat around with one another it should be an investing in one another Samuel that ain't very deep I'm not going to get to where I want to get to tonight but it's very true the art of conversation is almost lost and we were made listen that's where we were made and the conversations and what we would have with one another that's where there should be a release within our lives I can't get into all those things and chemicals and things in our body but Satan wants to hijack those things oh I've got so much going on I just need an outlet I just need this I I just need this and and we're in a busy time we're under pressure you see when it comes down to it at the end of the day at the end of the day what has it done for us I'm friends listen I don't believe that God's against some pleasure in our life but I believe we need to have restrictions are you with me I believe that we're a people we're talking about ruling and reigning in the Millennium I believe we are people that ought to be able to say to rule and Reign Over our own flesh Rule and Reign Even in our own homes it's what we keep ourselves to because it's not us working ourselves up into something but it's recognizing Satan would love to do nothing more than to clog up our lives it's what we're giving ourselves to and this is what Jude 1 verse 20 says beloved building up yourselves on your Most Holy Faith now who's building us up building up yourselves so it's you and I that's responsible it's like a person that says well I'm not growing so I'm not growing so I'll go here I'll go there I'll tell you what I'll just go to another church I'm not growing really you realize growing is not about the pastor the word comes forth but you've got to give yourself to God we have to pray we have to read we have to get into the things of God right everybody like in the days of Nehemiah everybody's got a section of the wall and with your family you have a section of the war that you're to be building with a sword in one hand and a trial in the other slapping on the bricks is that right everybody has their responsibility building up yourselves on your Most Holy Faith praying in the Holy Ghost it takes more than just praying over oatmeal I'm friends I'm not talking down to you I'm encouraging that it's not it's more than just a little here a little there but it's really seeking after God it's talking about a consecration in our life we want to see Divine love I'm telling you taking the Rapture it's going to be divine love taking the rapture what kept them out of the land brother Brahm tells us in turning northward what kept them out of the land became so much Division and bickering among brothers and cutting this one down cutting that one down cutting this one down that did not allow them to go into the land of Canaan it'll be divine love keep yourselves in the love of God looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life let me just end with this quote here I'm ending brother Brahm says I can't produce it I can't work it up God's got to give it I think that's important now you see this is why you and I have to press in this hour because even though you and I can look around and say huh what's this Spirit of entitlement around here and what's this and what's that it's all the spirits of the world but do you realize it wants to try to infiltrate Even in our lives and we're under pressure where we can become very weary from the toils of life and listen it is it's more than just even the laboring with hands the laboring with our minds or whatever more we're fighting against two hundred thousand thousand demons they've been released from the river Euphrates spirits on every hand that have been released against the Bride of Jesus Christ and you know what he wants to shut down it wants to shut down the moving of the Holy Spirit I'm not just talking about in the church I'm talking about in our individual lives he wants to shut down no matter where even you're at in your walk with God he wants to stifle it if he can I say God help me to have discernment help me to just stay in a place to where my eyes are anointed where I'm sensitive then I may not understand what's going on but I want to be sensitive enough to just step in the flow when Divine love is moving I want to step right into it and let's just go with it that's where I want to be Lord I want to be in that place to yield to it when it came brother Raymond did try to figure out about the maniac or the bull or the Hornets he just let go brother Graham tells us like this he says sin separate sin by separation talking about how God how the Divine love sin had separated that Divine love God told Adam and Eve not to eat those certain fruits and they did Sin brought separation and sin by separation brought hatred malice strife and envy what happened they separated from Divine love now God didn't that God didn't do this they separated themselves from Divine love so what happened it opened up because we're going to be a channel for something is that right we're going to be a channel we were made to be in channeled watch how brother M says this and when you separate from Divine love so if it's talking to me when you separate from Divine love then you can't overlook your brother's mistakes but but it's my brother's mistakes but I have no power to overlook them when I've separated from Divine love so what that lets me know if I can't Overlook my brother's mistakes my sister's mistakes they're not the problem I've got away from the source that gives me Grace to overlook it when you separate from Divine love then you can't overlook your brother's mistakes no more you gotta ball him out for it you can't Overlook sisters mistakes no more because you've got away from that Divine part that love part but if you really love the Lord Jesus if sister or brother does something to you oh well that's all right they didn't mean to do it that's the kind of love that Christ had father forgive them they don't know what they're doing I believe that that's the degree in the groom that's the degree in the bride see it's impossible for you or I that doesn't lay within this to overlook people's mistakes that doesn't lay in here I don't care how good your DNA is I don't care how much wonderful teaching you had in your home thank God for wonderful teaching but it takes Divine love to be able to over look oh my I wish I had more time to preach this right now said what if he had held my sins against me what an awful person I was but he loved me so well that he forgave me for them notice what did he love not my sins not my mistakes he loved me [Music] glory be to God when I was undone he forgave me he loved me a pure love and when Adam separated himself from pure love of keeping God's word in his heart when he did that these other faculties come in Malice Envy strife and hatred so whose fault was it notice Brother Brad and put it he didn't say that serpent no he didn't say oh that devil no when Adam failed to keep God's word in his heart if he would have kept God's word in his heart then he would have been able there would not this would not have entered malice in being strive but the Samuel is it that simple I believe it is I believe it is see it's remember it's always Satan's objective to try to make the atonement complicated brother grandma said like this he said God's not complicated it's just simple it's just giving ourselves to God say Lord this is your word it's like tonight when I look at this right here tonight I can just say Lord if if there's things that I'm kind of hung up on then you know what it isn't that it's that person I need to fall in love with you all over again I need to go deeper Lord let me go deeper deeper in the love of Jesus why because it is the Divine Love part that allows us to overlook and see this person see that person see this person oh God help us I want to yield to that tonight I believe that stream is Flowing right through here tonight I I just want to get in that stream and say Lord Here I Am Lord I just want to yield to that stream just to yield to what the holy spirit is moving Lord in my life let's pray Heavenly Father Lord how I thank you we thank you Lord oh God for the Simplicity Lord God of your word of your presence and how that you Lord come down in such a way to speak to us Lord and father right here tonight Lord I could say from my own life Lord and for this church Lord I want more of the love of God I Lord I want to step Lord in that channel Lord Lord when there are we can see needs that's all around us circumstances it's not just in the church Lord but in family and marriages and everything Lord oh God may we just Lord let's live in that place Lord to where our lives are consecrated sure we're going to make mistakes there's things Lord that is dying daily that we're going to have to say Lord forgive me but thank you Lord that there is a place that we could come to thank you for conviction Lord thank you that we have an advocate thank you that there's a perpetuation lord God for our sins Lord we're thankful Lord and father we just want to remain remain in that place Lord that you're always welcome Lord because Lord there's going to be moments where we're coming into a pasture Lord where a bull is there's going to be moments Lord where father there's a situation like this in Oregon Lord the Lord or let the Hornets father all these things Lord will be their Lord but oh God we don't have to fear we don't have to wonder Lord It's just Lord falling in love with you just Lord that Divine love oh I don't want to be separated from the love of God I don't want to be Lord pulled away when we get cold Lord and I'm Different Lord but all let us stay Lord just right up next to the fire lord God when our lives are worn by the presence of almighty God where the Holy Spirit can move down lord in our lives Lord where Grace could step in Lord and project Divine love into our heart that can be projected for the situation Nations Lord that would call for it Lord oh Lord Jesus I know Lord that just as the prophet with all these these things Lord he was not expecting them these things that happened he was not expecting him Lord he did not go that morning Lord with the wondering if I wonder if I'm going to cross and walk into a bull no but Lord he was walking with you Lord and father when there was a need Lord Grace stepped in I just happened to believe how Grace has stepped into our lives Lord to bring to us Redemption story I just believe that Grace stepped in for Abraham on Mount Moriah I believe it was Grace Lord that stepped in and provided the realm Lord God I believe Lord Jesus that it's Grace Lord that one of these days Lord oh Father it might be the hardest morning we've had we might be Lord God in a hard-pressing time but we'll look Lord in that mirror and standing behind us we'll be that loved one [Applause] oh Jesus Grace will step in Lord and we'll be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye oh God I believe that Lord for each of Our Lives Lord help us Lord help us Lord be very purposeful Lord and how that we give ourselves and we consecrate ourselves Lord Even in our homes and Lord Our Lives individually oh God that's a responsibility that the Lord falls upon our our hands and Lord we take your direction Papa your leadership Lord we want to Lord just be in that channel Lord that father on The Divine Love Can can step in Lord maybe it's to speak with a loved one of something that they're going through and Lord the love of God can step down and not taking sides with the wrongful feeling but the love of God would step down and bring it right back to the word to where that loved one can be stabilized and encouraged and strengthened Lord and their eyes can be lifted up Lord from looking at the problem and the circumstance Lord whether it be at school and the job or where no matter where it might be oh God that the love of God could step in Lord that Jesus Christ could be the object of our Focus Lord our attention Lord because charity never faileth the Lord we love you and we thank you Lord in Jesus precious name you know I don't know if I ever shared this with you or not but one of the brothers I don't know very you know very well my boys knowing my wife for once brother Hoover his brother Hoover's a deacon there brother Nathan brianson brother Hoover's grandmother was the nanny that brother Branham and sister meaty brought in to care for the children my sister meaty would travel with brother Branham during the time when the vision had been given about a coming child brother Branham took her around and began to show her the places in the house begin to show her certain things and different things to do and he took her he said you see that post right out there in the shower in the yard she said yeah he said I don't ever

hornets and I asked him to forgive me for disturbing their nest he said so don't ever let the children play near that post oh friends I believe that's what God has called us to I believe there's some posts that's in our lives that God has there's been things that has been drove down in our lives and God experiences where God's Grace has stepped in we're not without testimony we're not without witness Even in our own lives I know sometimes we look at a situation and think well my this situation is different but it still is still in need of God and the same God that allowed the post to be drove down for those Hornets is the same God for this because within it all you know what's actually taking place is we're becoming more useful more surrendered in his hands what the enemy meant for evil God has turned it for our good he's so good in me I just want to step in that channel is that how you feel I just want to step in I just want to go with it I don't want to I don't want to question it when he says move I just want to move I don't want to say Lord how is this going to work with the bull I don't want to I just wanna be in a place to where when it moves I want to go I want
