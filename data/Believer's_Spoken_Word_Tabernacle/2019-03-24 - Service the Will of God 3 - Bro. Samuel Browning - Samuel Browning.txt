character it's not lifeless it's his life amen that is a powerful name Amen we just thank God for His mercy amen this morning and so good to be together and we want to just go right into the word this morning that's just God will just just direct us here I want to go to First Samuel chapter 10 for samuel chapter 10 we want to move forward a little bit some things as the Lord will direct us will reach back and pick up on Saul as we continue to move forward here we have been looking at that thought on serving the will of God there's no way that we could serve the will of God unless it's made known to us and we know that God's mind and his will a lays here in print before us but without the Holy Spirit to reveal it we don't know his will concerning it so - think of it - potentially to have here within our hands to know the will of God or to have the will of God but yet how we need the Holy Spirit to actually reveal to us his will verse 17 and Samuel called the people together unto the Lord to miss me and said unto the children of Israel as the Cyndi's words thus saith the Lord God of Israel I brought up Israel out of Egypt and delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of all kingdoms and of them that oppressed you and ye have this day rejected your God who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your tribulations you know right here something's wrong it should it shouldn't have even had to have went even to this place because it's already been told before you've rejected the Lord but now right here this should there shouldn't have been anything else that should have been no other scriptures that should have just been you know what we had the wrong thought forgive us we were wrong it shouldn't nothing else should have had to been said because this of what has been declared you have this day rejected your God who himself saved you of all of your adversities and your tribulations well didn't God use men he did Nehemiah under inspiration called him saviors but it wasn't the men that delivered him it was the Lord God it was the Lord God and ye have said unto him notice you have said unto him nay but set a king over us now therefore present yourselves before the Lord by your tribes and by your thousands let's just let's just ask the Lord for his leadership this morning anybody like to be remembered in prayer god bless you dear Jesus Lord we stand here this morning Lord and this solemn assembly Lord a gathering Lord that your God but it's not called by man but a gathering Lord that has been assembled by you and Lord as you have expressed your God in your word that wherever two or three are gathered together in my name there will I be in their midst also Lord Jesus we need you this morning Lord we can read the word but we need more than that we need you to come Lord there are needs there are lives their hearts Lord we need direction and leadership and Lord we're depending on you that you would come your God speak to us Lord through your word this morning what I want myself just to be found hidden behind the cross Lord dear God that you could speak Lord according to the needs that Lord that are here upon our hearts Lord you know questions Lord you know it where every circumstance is every situation you know that Lord and we're mindful of it and we're mindful of our inability Lord dear God to actually come and meet that need though Lord it might be something when someone would Lord express a need maybe there would be a scripture or a quote we could actually mention that to him but Lord what really would need would be the Lord to actually speak to their heart and deliver whether it's that scripture that quote or whether it's just that expression of Christ in our life to reach out to him Lord God father we need you Lord so we ask that you would come Lord you who have taken the seals off your self Lord you have revealed yourself Lord God in this last day and to us Lord and in our lives and through us Lord we ask that you'll come Lord father may you just move upon our hearts this morning Lord God heal those that are sick in their body Lord just here in the request Lord that summer Lord not able to be here with us this morning Lord dear God knowing that Lord they would just give everything to be able to be in the house of God I pray that Lord that you would minister to their hearts this morning Lord may you minister to their lives mid-age of the Lord just pass right through the neighborhood where they're at Lord God and father we pray that Lord not only would you heal the sick and body among us this morning but Lord we pray that God that you would just heal and save Lord every sin sick soul Lord may you deliver the captive this morning Lord God may father you release the Lord God from any oppression Lord or depression Lord of the enemy father may the Liberty of the Holy Spirit Lord just moved your God throughout the hearts Lord of your children this morning Lord may the promises Lord oh God become so real before us Lord God and faith rise in our hearts Lord God Lord God to take those things Lord that belong to his Lord by faith father help us this morning we pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen god bless use your being seated I want to just keep on reading there if we could and I'll say it's been good to have brother David and sister Jessica here with us a little Michael and got to spend just a few hours there with them and certainly in privileged to be able to do that we want to continue here with verse verse 20 now I want you to watch this you find even in God's God's order of things which I won't dwell on so much this morning but you find that Saul has already he's been anointed king over all Israel in the presence of Samuel remember in the previous chapter the Lord Himself spoke to Samuel and let Samuel know that I'm gonna be sending a man to you out of the tribe of Benjamin and he'll be coming to you tomorrow and this is who you shall anoint to be over my people and you always find things when God would actually when someone would be moving into office it's always something that isn't all the way out in public but it actually takes place in secret first and then it comes forth to be made known and that's a pattern that you can go on with David and on and on but you look here of how that Saul has already he's been anointed to be king but now it's setting forth behold before the entire assembly and so now you know Saul and and sand Samuel you know the the anointing oil has already been poured out upon saw how be it it was poured out with a vial and not to dwell on it too much but you realize what a vial is a vial is judgment a vial is judgment so the outpouring of yet the Holy Spirit that of the vial of oil that is poured out upon Psalm is something that when you look at it he is not really under the judgment like the baptism of the Holy Ghost would come upon the soul and lift you and I above the judgment placing us in Christ but rather that vial itself as the anointing of the Holy Spirit would be poured out a person could have the Holy Spirit anointing their life and yet still not be converted so when we look at this and you find of how that it would go on here in verse 20 the Bible says when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near the tribe of Benjamin was taken and when he had calls the tribe of Benjamin to come near their families the son of maitre was taken and saw the son of Kish was taken and when they saw him they could not he could not be found therefore they inquired of the Lord further if the man should come he thinner and the Lord answered behold he hath hid himself among the stuff and they ran and fetched him fence and when he stood among the people he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward now remember back in the opening part of 1st Samuel 9 the Bible says that he was a goodly young man he was a goodly that word the very first time that those words are used goodly it's the same word that God would use in the beginning and behold God saw it was good so there were things that were arranged in the right way when we would look at saul saul was someone that when we would look at it he would no doubt be arranged but his arrangement maybe you know it's a handsome guy is a tall fella he was arranged according to what the people themselves wanted to see they were looking at now think about it it would not have been fitting within this particular place to God to present them some little ruddy boy at this time because that's not what they looked at as the strength to be able to fight against the opposing army they looked at it as strength that had been so moved to carnality that they looked at strength itself being that of size and and that of stature but you know what it is in size and stature on the outside that was what matters what matters is is how big is God on the inside because that's what it comes down to you can take a person you know when you look at it like this you can take a person that has you know known God for years and years and years and maybe they know the scriptures know the message and whatever more but yet they've not let God really have the right away within their life there's a lot of knowledge there's a lot of things that they know but yet when when we look at it that you can take a person that God has just taken ahold of that person's life and if that person can just forgive themselves in such a way and just you know yielding to God you watch how God can feel right down in that life and God can begin to open things within that heart you know they may not be able to speak a lot of deep things here and there but there is a life where they're living from a deep resource and let me tell you something they live a life that other people say you know what I know there's something different about them and I want that joy that they have it's not just the strictness by which we live it's got to be a joy that the real Holy Ghost produces within our life a real joy in the Lord now when you look at this how that you know here is Saul that's taken within this moment he's higher than you know all the people it looks like this is the guy now watch I want you to pay attention to the wording here if you look in verse 24 samuel said to the people see him whom the LORD hath chosen that there is none like him among all the people and all the people shouted and said god save the king then samuel told the people the manor of the kingdom and he wrote it in the book and he laid it up before the lord and samuel sent all the people away every man to his house there's a thing when samuel would start into this year he would begin to tell them the manor of the kingdom you know you can the Bible you well not the Bible but you know even the phrase that you can talk about of even how a tree leans many times it'll fall you can look at the direction and see a pathway sometimes the way things are going and notice Saul here he is that the direction that Israel is taking and how that Samuel under inspiration he can tell them this is going to be the manner of the kingdom when you look back in other previous places in the scripture here and I think of that what we just read in verse 24 see him whom the Lord had chosen that there is none like him among all the people you remember that God had already said in Deuteronomy 17 and God let him know when you come into the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee and shall possess it and shall dwell therein and shall say I will a king over me like as all the nations that are about me notice I will set a king over me and you find that inspiration that's the same inspiration when we trace it all the way back that led the rebellion in heaven it was a situation that when you when you look at this rebellion it is a situation where I will rose up you know you always look at how the enemy the enemy is never able to submit himself you realize that he's never able to submit himself but here he rises up with ambitions and this is exactly here the inspiration whereby that that Israel is being moved and God let him know this is what's going to happen when you come in the land I will set a king over me but notice in verse 15 it goes on to say thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee whom the Lord thy God shall choose now you know there's a big difference in setting a king over of who you chose and a king who God chooses you realize a bacon they were setting a king over them and it would perceive when we look at it through the Scriptures he would look at it then his goal that saw was the chosen of the Lord but reality God only picked out what it was that was the desire within the heart of the people I tell you right now they never would have accepted somebody who would have been ready somebody who would have been small they would never have accepted that there had to be somebody that would match the desire that would be there in their heart and they and they they chose this king you know we could say like this they voted and elected this king but that's why brother mem said dogs men are not elected into office they are anointed into office because it's different when God chooses that man and then God presents that man and the Holy Ghost says we recognize the choosing of Almighty God there's a great difference here within these searchers great difference the Bible goes on to say in acts 13 21 but here you know Paul is picking this up afterwards they desired a king and God gave unto them saw the son of Kish a man of the tribe of Benjamin by the space of 40 years they desired a king now remembers we we looked at this here that it was it was God's desire that God was going to set up a king over Israel but to see how that within it safe to knowing the plan of God here he gets ahead and he pushes Israel into this place for them that they begin to request something and but their request and the motivation that the mode is the desires behind it are not in line and in tune with God's desire oh my now watch out watch out this will take place here how that you know Samuel will go on in verse verse Samuel chapter 12 verse 6 the Bible says how that Samuel now is called the people and he says it is the Lord that advanced Moses and Aaron and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt you know you think about the scripture in the book of Hebrews when it speaks about even those who were appointed to that of high priest it said no man taketh this honor unto himself is that right it is not something that a man would take it unto himself but he whatever that God has in God's desire it is God making known his honor upon that life and it's God's choosing oh my this is exactly what you and I when we look at it we look for the honor of God which is his blessing his life to be poured out upon that word to vindicate that word and here God is letting it be known it is I that advanced Moses and Aaron they were not even looking for what God had called them to I'll tell you right now you know I look at it many times they're told in many situations sometimes you come across those who are looking for pastors I've just been very honest I said if you got a man that comes in here and he tells you that God has spoke to him and led him to take this church you better run from that guy right there because the reality is that that is not how it works it works when God works he works on bow yNN's when God was dealing with Moses he was dealing with the people at the same time that's how God works God wants to work in unity God does not want resistance God moves in such a manner of unity but to think how then Moses here he was he was out running here was Aaron they were not looking for this but God is the one who advanced it it's God who brought it about you know what is being brutally portrayed here all the way through this chapter of how that Israel would get in trouble and then God step on the scene when they repented and God would send to them saviors God would send to them those whom he had made himself known to them that they would lead them into battle you see God's people are not without leadership amen and God's leadership of the Holy Ghost is not something just like a loose cannon that's out here he works within a divine order God will never leave the order of his word never will he leave the order of his word so they think of how that Samuel here is the grace of God where that here God would even let them know that that I've been the one who has stood for you again and again I'm the one who has provided for you you see they've already heard this even in previous chapters but he's letting them know it again you would think that after this time that they would say wait a minute here there has been three services like this but instead it passed him right on by there was no connection with what was taking place oh god help us amen help us help you help me but not just set and dis hear things but hearing in a matter of deflection but let us hear it you know this is why brother man said in sudden secret going away from the church he said to get ready he said I've got to get myself ready and you've got to get yourself ready he said I can't be worrying about you and you can't be worrying about me he said you've got to take care of your Oh life glory be to God now to think of this here here look at look at this how that this is picked up here and you wonder within it that all of a sudden that this this request is made about a king and you find that in the midst here of verse 12 of 1st Samuel 12 the Bible says here when ye saw nay - what a name it means serpent when you saw that serpent the king of the children of Amon come out against you you said unto me may but a king shall reign over us when the Lord your God was your king Israel looks at an encroachment even in even in chapter 11 this is even beyond what we just read in chapter 10 but here there obviously was an encroachment of Nass even before what we actually begin to see in verse 11 - where that the people themselves remembered they're looking at how that the other nations are led out by a king but what they failed to recognize is that the Lord was king over them that the Lord was the one who was leading them in battle you know God's promise was even back there in Exodus 15 of what had taken place at the Red Sea God even said by that mighty act he said with this right here I will close the dukes of Edom to be amazed I will cause fear to come upon the people in the land in Exodus 23 God went on to say about the angel that I have set before thee to keep thee in the way and bring them to the place that I prepared for thee you know God said in that in that same place if you obey my voice you'll heed my word then I will be an adversary to your adversaries I'll be an enemy to your enemies oh my you see what a precious reality it is to be under the leadership of the Holy Ghost sure we have test sure we have try sure we have obstacles that come our way but you know what those obstacles do they only prove and give God opportunities they are platforms that God Himself can step forward and make himself known in our lives I tell you friends I just don't want to read about God that ain't going to get us in a rapture it takes a living God that same God he stood there night after night on the platform that same God that delivered that word that same God working among his people and in our lives it takes that same God moving in a lot no wonder brother Bev said you give me a church he said that is exercise to believe in miracles that are exercised to believe in the word he said I'll show you a church that the rapture will not be a hard thing for her because the rapture is not our efforts what a sad sad sad case here you said unto me a king shall reign over us when the Lord your God was your king now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen and whom you desired well I thought God chose him God did choose him but God chose him based on what they wanted you see when they didn't no longer want to heed and walk under the word and under the leadership of the Holy Spirit then God said I'll give you what you want but yet he pleaded with them you realized when God was pleading with them right here through Samuel they could have at that time said you know what I'm wrong I don't know what I was thinking about I'm wrong I'm wrong but they weren't even moved in that way and matter of fact they have even said the opposite nay we want our King Oh God now therefore the King whom you have chosen and whom you desired and behold the Lord hath set a king over you if you will fear the Lord and serve him and obey his voice and not rebelled against the commandment of the Lord then shall both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continue following the Lord your God but if he will not if you will not obey the voice of the Lord but rebelled against the commandment of the Lord then shall the hand of the Lord be against you as it was against your father's God don't make anybody serving God don't have no respect to persons it's very clear when we look even at Israel how that God let it be known if you obey me and follow me and heed to my Commandments heed to my word I'll be that enemy to you minimus I'll be the adversary to your adversaries I'll be on your side because you're on mine one thing that I want you to notice I know it's the obvious sometimes it's the obvious that's overlooked but there's one thing that's obvious in all these scriptures that we've read here over the past weeks they never once sought the Lord they never asked Samuel Samuel what do you think about this you see even though maybe services had continued they had heard Samuel and maybe it went on but they were not under the headship of the word it actually presented itself in a manner to where they didn't even seek God's advice home I wonder what they were resting on what were they relying on where were they resting were they resting upon some sensation were they resting upon a previous scripture well you know we're God's covenant people all of that is true all of that is true but all of that in its proper place they didn't even ask called they didn't even and when all the burdens went when even the enemy when they asked and the rest of them were coming up around them they didn't even send in a prayer request they didn't even lift it up and say hey I don't know what's going on here but we need help they were surrounded even in the midst of a temptation they did not even ask for prayer and say Lord we need help or friends don't ever let us get to a place of pride where it's so built upon who we believe that we are to where we fail to look to God to recognize every day we need him every moment we need him do you realize the spirit the climax of this spirit that began back there in that day on in that first church age and how that it leads into this time right here to where that in this age you've got the spirit where it raised us to a place where that of the a man the Holy Ghost is here among us and then you got the same spirit that says I don't have need of nothing you know to think of it we can have all the word and yet have nothing if we don't have him we missed everything because he's the one that gives life to this word without him this word is a dead letter it will help our lives how would we give heed to it it'll strengthen us but translation we must have that of the Holy Ghost to lead and guide and direct us in every moment let us not walk by just our own thinking of things or let us not walk just by little things that we see and say well I think this might be God's will you be sure it's God's will and if God doesn't confirm it then wait on the Lord we're living in a time you need to make sure you know where your footsteps are lenient they never asked God Lord helped me with my burdens you know God told him he told him as I read here in the previous scripture he told him the manner of the kingdom you know God not only totaled the manner of the kingdom God also had told him and told him in a previous chapter that one day you're going to cry out because of the king that you have chosen right being it didn't look like it but he said one day you're gonna cry out you you see what we find here is that God is faithful God allows us to make our own decisions and our own choices he allows it he permits that but God also says whatever the repercussions are I won't remove it but then again whatever the rewards are I won't remove them either those decisions and choices that we always have before us sometimes I know we take the scripture that you know and it's true whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap that is true and if a man souls bad he's gonna reap bad but if a man shows good he's gonna reap good sometimes the sowing that's going forth is not always evident in the generation and the time but it becomes known later on you with me now Paul himself we was not alive when that first church age started but the seeds that were sown it went forth and there was crop and moved all the way down down through time to where you and I are now and to think of it even in this hour where God has taken the messenger off the scene but yet the seed that had been sown that seed of the world that supernatural reality of the Living God you realize friends here we are standing here years and years later some 54 years later but you know what God is still the same God as a matter of fact he's greater now than he was then not because of people but brother man tells us over and over from the early parts of the later part he said this gospel it will be taken in a more powerful way he goes on to tell us I believe it's 1959 the reason of that is because we are coming closer and closer to the coming of the Lord it's not about you around its God fulfilling its word in his season God did not remove his power and then he expects us to get through puttering along that's not so at all God's demonstrated manifested power that was here before us it was to manifest himself as the Living God that our faith would be so divinely placed within that word in a perfect faith and the power of God to move behind it and make it live in our life you're not going to tell me that God took away the power God would be working contrary to his program the gift and that of a prophet yeah God took that away because what was needed to be done had been done had been done the seventh angel had finished his course oh my now think of this here God gave Israel the desire via their heart and you think of this of how they you know when you look at it so often you know we we quote and say God will give you the desire of your heart and that's true this is where brother Branham would tell us and does God change his mind about his word he said you'd be careful what your desire is because he said God will give you the desire of your heart be careful that desire because he said he promised to give you the desire of your heart and let your desire be the word of God let your desire be his will never your own will his will if you ask him for something and he don't give it you say thank you Lord you know what's good [Applause] because there are things that we might desire I'm not talking about sinful things those things that we can desire that would be godly but it all comes in time and season it is not to be manipulated and ordered by the hands of man it's to be ordered by God himself but desires desires ho God let our desires be to his word sometimes it's not it's not that the desire itself is wrong as we've looked at it sometimes it's the wrong season it's the wrong time it's the wrong way everything becomes God's provided way God's channel in God's time decisions and choices they have rewards they have consequences sometimes constant choices that we make we repo sometimes the choices that we make we don't just reap them for a day for an hour for weeks months sometimes as choices we reap for the rest of our lives let's give an example here I don't even have to go in very far but think of brother Branham himself the choice that he made his mother-in-law never forced him he made that choice you find over and over were the choice the hardness I can't even imagine it can't even imagine it but do you realize even after he's been married and with children here he stands there in Christ the mystery of God revealed opening and that mystery in were in that service and he makes the statement he says you know what he said every time I come back here God God God makes it hard on me and he said I believe what that is is because I failed to go you mean God would allow that to be you mean God would not remove every scar from a life you mean God would not remove all the consequences no because there's certain times and certain things that God loves to make His grace no you think about it if anybody could have crumbled he could have crumbled in that hour and matter of fact the flesh man the spirit man William Branham crumbled it was ready even when he stood there beside his little girl he said I was ready to say but he said to think if that typos hadn't been there he didn't defeat the devil with doctrine that day the devil he backed up with doctrine the devil is backed up with the Living expression and divine revelation of Jesus Christ that's anchored in the heart of the believer this world is not dying for doctrine this world is dying for the revelation of Jesus Christ doctrine does not convert Souls doctrine is the bark that comes on the tree after life has now went through it sometimes it's things so backwards where people have become so educated they've got barked but no life bars and no life barked but they bite rewards there are rewards for right choices there are consequences and to think of it Oh God you know friends even when you and I have made the wrong decisions because we have we've made decisions that were wrong sometimes you realize that right when you make it other times you recognize it down the road are you but see God in His grace if our heart stays with that desire Lord I want to be in tune with you then God will bring back what has when his permissive will he'll bring it right back in line to his perfect will but it won't be us it'll do it it'll be him because you and I as we came by the permissive will of God in this first birth remember it had to be him come by a virgin birth to now come to bring back that bringing us and leading us back into the perfect will of God I'm so glad about that aren't you I'm grateful for God's mercy to come and to deal with our lives to think of this of how that you know within that permissive will of God there's times as I said we can learn from it you know you think of how that brother branham learned from them when he went over to to Africa there that time brother BAM learned from it what did brother Graham learned he learned that I'm not gonna let Minister set my itinerary right even though brother Branham protested it and said no we shouldn't go this way but he was kind of trapped right he was kind of trapped but notice how that God moved in it didn't mean that notice that didn't mean that he wasn't going to suffer for it he did suffer for it he suffered for over six months with that amoeba but you know God was faithful to his word sometimes we we look at things you know and God has a way about instructing you and I and teaching you and I you know we can look at that you know we could point that out and you know we could have sat down you know the brother banura we could have been there you know and you know you're trying to a brother Ram you got this for me but here's why you got this amoeba you got this amoeba because of this and this and this and this and this and this that don't do nobody a bit of good the reality God permitted this because of his choice but when a heart is sensitive to God God will come and teach us even from that moment he will teach us four things that will come later in life so even those decisions and choices that have been wrong decisions and choices if we'll learn it and put it into his hands he but he said he makes all things work together for our good nothing everything is good but he'll make it work for good see this is where you want to just allow the Lord and I broad to minister there into your life with things that you know that you can see allow His grace to move down in our life to correcting those things maybe it's an attitude about an event maybe it's a thought about a previous event but if you allow the Holy Spirit to come down and just allow him to move in your life he will brood and brood over your life and bring it to that place that he himself desires to bring you to in your life Oh mother here look here and saw first Samuel 13 let's look here for a few moments the Bible says in verse 1 Saul reigned one year and when he had reigned two years over Israel Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel where of two thousand were with Saul in mcNeish and in Mount Bethel and a thousand were with Jonathan Gabala of Benjamin and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent and Jonathan smoked the garrison of the Philistines that was in gaiba and the Philistines heard of it and Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land saying let the Hebrews hear you know I think when you we read this here in the scripture brother branham you know he'll he'll take up on this particular verse and you run his quarterback into he into chapter 11 as well but just see how that Saul himself after a battle has been won and it was Jonathan that won the battle as a matter of fact even in other chapters it's Jonathan winning battles that's really that's really who's been winning the battles and you found some really interesting parts about Jonathan in his life but you look how thats all here he sounds a trumpet and you know brother branham said it like this he said how did God you know had moved there and he said then you find house all he sounds a trumpet and he says with that trumpet you see what saul has done he begin to get puffed up you remember there's three things rubra me talks about you know with with that of the ministry has to watch popularity money women and he vine was saul soul is always linked to this of popularity to that of pride you know when I read about saw as a man that I feel sorry for I know that I know that he made it but I feel sorry for him because he was a man that got put in position by people people that were unhappy people that were displeased people that were fearful and this man got forced into a position that was not for him that's a sad thing God doesn't need to force anything God places God places he don't have to force nothing and look out it's all here in the midst of it he he rises within this time and pride itself has rose to a place look what I have done you remember in a previous chapter here think of this of how that you know when you look at how that God would so set up that of a king now when you know when we look ahead you know when you think of how that God does it with that of job of Joshua well then you even look ahead to David in comparing it to this right here when you look even ahead to that time the Bible talks about how then men themselves gathered themselves to David you don't read about how but David was having to assemble people but it was were God himself that night Matt have been so anointed by God - God brought the Assembly around that gift that he had anointed him that life but you don't find that was so you find Saul he's got to blow the trumpet he's got to sound the trumpet he's gathering people unto himself now watch how he does it the Bible says in bins in believe it's first samuel 11 6 somewhere in there it speaks of how that here that saul at that time the bible says that when he he took an oxen and he any viewed it and he used that oxen in two pieces and he scented by the hands of messengers and he said whosoever cometh not forth after soul and after Samuel whoa that is a mistake right there after Saul and after Samuel it should have been after Samuel and after Saul even the order is wrong but notice what he's doing he's got to get a following he's got to get people to him now how can he get people to him how can he draw people to himself he's the king he's been anointed king it ought to be that the people would just be drawn there and placed by God but a hidden so shall it be done unto his oxen and the fear of the Lord fell on the people and they came out with one consent look at that the fear of the Lord came on the people why because the people feared Samuel he's using this leverage to draw people unto himself you know it's the same way that the word the way the word the way the message anything it can be used in a place but listen when it is Fuli drawn the battle god it is not drawing to that of a church he does not draw you to a personality listen to me now it does not even draw you in fear it draws you by divine love when anything itself draws people together by fear that it's not of God it's none of God the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom but remember the fear of the Lord it's trusting God our confidence is in him our confidence it's not a man but our confidence is in the Lord and to think of how that this would be drawn you know brother Ram would put it like this he said of how that this fear that would come upon you know the people because of Samuel and he deals with it in a stance he says you know the Holy Spirit is our judge behold the Holy Spirit he said not a Pope not a bishop or anybody to be a judge the Holy Spirit the person of God in the form of the Holy Spirit is our judge and our guide and yet within this the people would they would feel a sense of relief well hell you know if Samuels attach to it it must be alright but Samuel never told him to do this you find one thing that's present within Saul's life over and over he doesn't he doesn't and has not even to this place sought for the will of God never he's never sought for it you never find in any of the scriptures right here that we've read up to Betty ever called for the e fund where he ever called for the priest up to this point never what a dangerous place a dangerous place to feel as though he's got everything together we've got everything together they don't need to Ascot I don't need to ask God about this you see Saul had more listen to me now Saul had more confidence in his position I hope you with me he had more confidence in his position it's the same way whether it be King whether they pastor whether it be prophet whether it be husband whether it be wife whether it be deacon whether it be trustee on and on and on you can have confidence and your position and you operate simply because this is my position this is what's said to be done right here and you operate just by position if it's not by the unction of the Holy Ghost it's not even received as husbands wives dads moms pastor on and on and on we need his leadership we needed every step of the way we need his divine direction and God does not want things associated by fear even in that of our home God does not want our homes to be run by fear he does not want to church to be run by fear fear produces instability in people's lives divine love will take where fear is and divine love will actually cast out fear because the love of God is a sanctifying and cleansing love that is actually able to take even your own demeaning thoughts about yourself and the washing of water by the word is able to wash you and lift you in divine grace in what God says about your life God doesn't want nobody following him because of fear you know why because the first situation you run it doesn't want anybody by fear I don't want anybody come in this church by fear I don't people to fear me I want them to fear the Lord who stands behind it to respect that absolutely because that's where they're so but I don't want people to fear well well brother sending no it's fear the Lord not brother Samuel it's fear the Lord because he is always with us he's the one who's watching over it you see it don't matter with you you look at it you can come to church day after day or service after service and you look at how but the scripture would be a place right here that brother man tells us he said what they were warning here he said when they seem that join their they wanted just enough to say well God is with us but they want you to live how they want to live they want to do how they want to do I'll tell you we want to live how God desires us to live we want to walk according that word you know that's God's grace that God would open his pattern to you and I God would let you and I know what's acceptable in our lives that's God's grace His grace and His mercy he don't want to be just the judge just the one who is here when we're here one day out of the week or two days out of the week he wants to be with us day by day no overshadowing our life he's higher protection day by the moment after a moment he's the one who is our guide my look at this result the Bible says verse four I'm coming down and all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines and that Israel also was had an abomination with the Philistines and the people were called together after Saul to gilga and the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel thirty thousand chariots and six thousand horsemen people as the sand which is on the seashore in multitude and they came up and pitched in McMath eastward from behavin Beth even when the men of Israel saw that they were in a straight for the people were distressed then the people did hide themselves in caves and in thickets and in rocks and in high places and in tents and some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of GAD and Gilead as for Saul he was yet in gilga and all the people followed him trembling this is the result of a lack of headship the people are in fear here the enemy is approaching its fearful everything is fear all around I tell you your life is not meant to be ruled by fear the same I'm afraid I'll be deceived even that fear is evil we have a promise in the word but then says if you're afraid of that he said look up look up we have that promise God is faithful he will not allow us to be deceived if we're standing in him God will not allow that it is not God's will to operate with fear when you gotta watch out for this you gotta look out for that you gotta watch out for this you've got to look out for that you've got to watch out for this well tell me what I can look for well but I don't know about what you can look for but you know I know what you need to you know you need it wrong thing it's fear hiding in caves hiding you know people look at these people then this should have been where they are uniting together instead of uniting together they're drawn off they're getting in caves they're getting in heels this very much looks like what takes place in the Book of Revelations when he comes there and stands before preparing for Armageddon hide us from the face of the lab here they should have been a time but you realize this is what the wrong leadership and wrong headship what it produces when everything even when things themselves it has to operate within the right order and the right boundaries if it doesn't it produces instability this is why there must be stability in lives that stability of the Holy Ghost within a life where a man and it's planet in the Lord Jesus Christ by the baptism of the Holy Ghost that plants you and I in the world and while lives are established in God the same fear it's a same fear that came in on that first couple there in the Garden of Eden God made it clear in the book of Deuteronomy we read from the leadership that of the the king is to be under the word of the Lord he might have five Baker's this one has ten Baker's but he's is to be under the word of the Lord he's to seek after the will of God his heart is not to be like that of the heart of a king so much as the heart of a servant you'll find over and over and over in David's life Lord thou art my king David was King but he said Lord you're my king he put himself under the Lord you find for Samuel 10/8 this is just let me just refer to this point here God had told Saul through Samuel these were orders thou shalt go down before me to gilga and behold I will come down unto thee to offer burnt offerings and to sacrifice sacrifice --is of peace offerings seven days shalt thou tarry till I come to thee and show thee what thou shalt do you see we look at this as it opens resuming there and that and that chapter remember Samuel himself in likened to that of the Holy Spirit God's mouthpiece here Terry seven days and when I come I'll show you what you should do was it that Saul didn't know how to offer up the offering he did he knew how to do it precisely but he wasn't called for that didn't know how matter how much he knew he wasn't called for it but here is a test that has given him wait wait can you wait sometimes that's the hardest thing to do because our first nature is one that is probe that is a given it can be given to fear anxiousness pressure all sorts of things that can come up around us pressures even in things to where you can have scriptures quoted to you quotes quoted to you come on somebody to where it would operate and try to operate within pressure let me tell you something if Satan knew the plan of God regarding this about King then Satan he can also look at things about our lives and safety knows if our desire friends if our desire is to please God more than anything else in the world you know this is where you've got to discern every spirit amen the Bible didn't say every word has said every spirit because sometimes the word it can seem like it's right on but it's the spirit it's the spirit discerned try every spirit see if it be of God that's why I'm brother Ram will tell us in discernment of spirit he said you can see this man he said but why don't he said you look and say tried to discern the heart he said discern from his heart what he's trying to achieve for the program of God both how we need we need that discernment we need that leadership when we stand in times in her home stand in times to the church we need that leadership of the Holy Spirit do realize even at times when there's things that takes place even within family sometimes we feel the pressures and whatever more you might want to do this and maybe you should do this and maybe you should do that but friends all of those things that ought to be hold just a moment let's pray let's pray let's stop all the debating and reasoning and hashing and building bridges and this and that that ain't getting nowhere let's pray let's seek the mind of God because if we're not careful we'll bit it we'll build a bridge that seven feet tall ends up being a salt you with me ends up being a song something that pressures that's under you know and we all feel that we fill it as husband's we fill in his wives I feel there's a pastor you can feel all the sorts way you want to do this you want to do this you want to do this under that but the thing that I have to wait on is and you have to do the same thing we must wait on the Lord it's not just this is black and white gets wait on the Lord bible says in verse 8 he tarried seven days according to the set time that Samuel had appointed but Samuel came not to gilga and the people were scattered from him and Saul said bring hither a burnt offering to me and peace offerings and he offered a burnt offering notice he offered a burnt offering and it came to pass that as soon as he had made and on an end of offering the burnt offering behold Samuel came and Saul went out to meet him that he might salute him and Samuel said what hast thou done Saul said because I saw that the people were scattered from me so who was the offering about who was the offering about him it had nothing to do with the people it had nothing to do with the will of God this was about so Oh God because I saw that the people were scattered from me and that thou came us not within the days of Planet and that the Philistines gathered themselves together and McMath therefore said I the Philistines will come down now upon me to gilga I have not made supplication unto the Lord I forced myself therefore and offered how sad is that this I've forced myself so why did you do it well it was the right thing to do I should offer a burnt offering I should offer peas offerings so you missed the key ingredient you didn't wait on the Lord you've intruded into an office that does not belong to you you've walked into a place you've presumed you moved into adventure because it looks like I see a need the need is before us I must do this but the RAM takes us in the message Salone he says you know why don't you let your life be like that of David referring back to Psalm 62 my time is in your hand Lord you hold my future he said even regarding he said even ministering brothers he said brothers he said you know he said you see the need of the hour you see the condition of the hour he said in sometimes it gets to such a place you get impatient impatience never produces patience impatience never produces peace impatience leads to more impatience leads to more impatience but if you can stop where you've been impatient and say Lord forgive me help me to be patient help me to wait on you because they that wait on the Lord they shall renew their strength wait on the Lord and be the good currants look how this come you know the riders even even say like this he said the riders say like this they say it couldn't have been but even thirty minutes of when this saw offering would have been consumed let's just say it was even an hour but to think of it an hour even if it was five minutes or a half an hour but everything should have been this is what Samuel said he said he would be here and I'm not going anywhere I'm not doing nothing until he shows up Samuel as the Prophet puts it here being a type of the Holy Ghost we'll wait and see what he says what do you say what do you say Lord you see even within this in our life nowhere does God want any of us any of you to serve Him by force it's not his will that you have to force yourself to live right you have to force yourself to come to church you have to force yourself to read force yourself to play pray force yourself then that's not of God to have to do that you don't listen to me it's not God's desire in that way but instead look instead of trying to take things in your own hands well I'm gonna do this and I'm gonna do that just say Lord you change me Lord change my life to match your word let my desire Lord let it match your desire Lord God you come and deal with my heart change my heart let my heart be lined up with your heart Lord God when that gets going and the hearts get lined up the hearts get connected then brother and sister it's not a force thing to serve God it becomes a privilege it becomes an honor it becomes a joy oh it isn't sometimes that we don't have to drag this carcass here it isn't sometimes that we don't have to make it get down and pray but what I'm talking about is on the inside he is the delight of our life there's a power that's moved in on the inside we're no longer the same people but our desire is to please him sometimes look at this even when it came to Lazarus there we don't notice here he is they sit for Jesus but he's coming right on time he's coming right on time you see even within that the patience jesus said with patience possess your souls even in the midst of trials my goodness times were we're looking hard what Jesus is there an into this any better felt like it maybe it's just me it's learning into this and it crosses your mind but then what raise them and said the Lord you've been faithful all the way up even to now and the way you'll keep on going you've been faithful Lord sometimes it seems like things itself it just spirals and things themselves just coming about but when we wait on the Lord there's times oh I'm so glad I'm so glad that we would be so trained and may we be so trained to wait on the great on the Lord Jesus not be pressured not be moved but wait on God wait on God then you know it's called directing it's God putting your footsteps down then when your footsteps go down it's possession that's the value of waiting on the will of God then you know you've got Authority you've got authority to stand before your enemies I forced myself let's just stop here your soul I thought about this much over the past weeks and things self-will self-will Saul was willing all of this willing at all about you know the sad part about it is is that's the same way that even that Cain came and worshiped in the beginning it was by self will it was a time to worship so he came to worship but Abel came to worship by divine revelation there was an auction that was directing him and leading his life but here solid we find one thing that is so it's so true that God Himself when we if we operate by self will we have to continue by self will to try to maintain it becomes us maintaining the cause instead of the Lord maintaining the cause but if we're in his will then it's not us maintaining it's him it's him it's Oh let that be the desire of your heart let it be the desire of our life so times the waiting it comes right down even into the moment comes right down sometimes they're very crucial times in her life we feel pressures you fill them I feel but God never has called you and I to operate by pressure we operate by the will of God Lord what's your will on it what's your direction on it he's faithful in it so good let's pray or Jesus these are sobering sobering points and false the Lord we desire Lord from our hearts to so reflectable or Jesus Lord God every every moment within our lives Lord we need you I know we say that a lot we mean it Lord I pray Heavenly Father Lord we think of saw I look at it Lord my heart just so often Lord I think about it it just it breaks Sol never he never asked for that but it was the people's choice pressure Lord that had thrust him out into a place that was never ordained or God in our lives when we look at Saul's life or Jesus I don't want to just look at things the Lord as a pastor as a husband as a father throughout the rest of this congregation lord those Lord God that fulfilling more different attributes that you placed offices and so forth our desire Lord God is to be under your leading sometimes the Lord when you lead us well not sometimes when you lead us but when you lead us Lord sometimes it seems like it's slow but help us to be comforted in your leading not in how fast but that you're leading or God sometimes decisions and choices and things that we have to make the Lord your God help us sort help us Lord that we'll defer to you Lord help us Lord God I pray not to operate by pressures but may we look Lord to you may that be the value of our life or God how many times order we've been right here Lord where Saul is there's times no doubt Lord God every one of us we've been lured in situations we've made decisions sometimes in haste should have been more in prayer forgive us Lord Jesus help us lord help us to be more sensitive help us not to be confident or God in our office attribute of our life position what God could say like this even in our spiritual position as the bride of Jesus Christ but may our confidence be in unity we must know who we are that's true but as your prophet told us Lord and why Christ speak David's confidence was in the anointing of the word that was upon his life or Jesus this is our confidence pathways the Lord so no doubt Lord throughout the building here Lord we could we could spend Lord hours in days countlessly we could talk about Lord mistakes that we've made choices here and there sometimes things Lord that we reap scars and marks and everything else but yet Lord God when we can look and see that your grace that has watched over our lives Lord even in times where we've made decisions that wasn't always along your perfect will we even see it as we look ahead we see with david many times but the difference was David's heart was he desired to please you more than anything sometimes you'd have to deal with David you'd have to crack the hardness of the shell to reach that heart that inner part that which Lord God you choose the Lord you were able to make it through to reach David's heart [Music] Lord Jesus sometimes the journeys of life we can look at paths of life that have been taken that may we look Lord and realize may it be Lord that we focus on where that you have brought us from sometimes Lord there's things about the life it's part of the journey the person can ask why did I have wanted this decision why do I have to go this way why did I make the Lord even though it would be a decision that they themselves could say I know that that was not God's perfect will and when they've surrendered it lord to you you were able to move down and teach him mold shape or to wear that Lord God the mistakes the things about our life can then stand out as stepping stones to one another of your grace Lord help
