[37:29] [Music]
[37:46] let's just stand and go to the Lord in
[37:49] prayer before you open the scripture
[37:50] this morning Heavenly Father were
[37:56] thankful Lord to be here this morning
[37:59] Lord we looked forward Lord to the word
[38:03] and to hear from you Lord Lord we loved
[38:07] the scene we love the worship I know
[38:10] that you love us to worship You Lord
[38:12] Lord now we've come to the place where
[38:15] we're expecting you to speak to us Lord
[38:17] and I pray their God you'll anoint me
[38:19] Lord that you may be able to speak to
[38:22] the people encouragement and uplifting
[38:24] and strength and I pray in Jesus
[38:26] Christ's name Amen
[38:31] well you're standing if you could turn
[38:33] feed your Bibles to Genesis chapter 3
[38:36] and I want to read verses 8 through 11
[38:41] but I want to speak on this morning is
[38:44] something that you already know about
[38:47] I'm no doubt many of you already know
[38:49] and their Bible students of the Bible
[38:55] and maybe it might be something that
[39:00] would help the young people as well but
[39:02] I believe that it's something we can all
[39:04] glorify God in and what I want to speak
[39:06] on is in what body in what body shall we
[39:11] be in the resurrection
[39:35] y'all excuse me it must be a good
[39:39] message
[40:09] verse 8 and they heard the voice of Lord
[40:12] God walking in the garden in the cool of
[40:14] the day Adam and his wife hid themselves
[40:17] from the presence of the Lord God among
[40:20] the trees of the garden the Lord called
[40:23] unto Adam and sent unto Him where art
[40:26] thou
[40:27] and he said I heard thy voice in the
[40:30] garden and I was afraid because I was
[40:32] naked and I hid myself and he said who
[40:35] told me to doubt was naked house now
[40:38] eaten of the tree whereof I commanded
[40:40] thee that thou should us not eat may be
[40:43] seated in what body shall we be in it
[40:54] says they heard the voice of the Lord
[40:58] God walking in the garden who's ever
[41:02] heard a voice walk before God came down
[41:09] every evening and walked with them
[41:12] there's men with them and cool of the
[41:15] evening and what body did he come down
[41:18] and walk with them he couldn't come down
[41:21] as just the great all eternal God in his
[41:27] in his presence and just walk with him
[41:30] that way but he actually walked with
[41:32] them and they heard him walking in the
[41:36] garden he was walking and as the often
[41:41] he for come down because God who he
[41:47] really is the title of the form he
[41:50] really is I'm telling you a man can
[41:52] never be able to comprehend that's why
[41:57] that he had to come down and flesh in
[41:59] the body of Jesus Christ so that man
[42:04] could finally touch God
[42:11] one day the Lord appeared to Abraham and
[42:13] the plains of Mamre Abraham was setting
[42:17] out in front of his tent and he saw
[42:22] three men come walking and when he saw
[42:26] them approach I believe that his
[42:29] attention was drawn more to one than the
[42:31] other because he said my lord if I found
[42:39] grace in thy sight come and tarry with
[42:42] me let me fetch a little water to sit
[42:44] under the tree under the shade here let
[42:48] me fetch some meat for you to eat and
[42:51] sup with me that was not that was God
[42:57] but not in the form of the great LOM he
[43:02] had to take a form a body to come down
[43:05] and be able to set with Abraham and talk
[43:09] with him and he took on at the often II
[43:12] form
[43:14] it's the often ybody to be able to come
[43:18] down and walk and set with Abraham and
[43:22] talk with
[43:27] parents me to Exodus chapter 33
[43:42] I want to read verses 12 through 23
[43:58] and Moses said unto the Lord see thou
[44:01] sayeth unto me bring up this people and
[44:04] thou has not let me know whom that will
[44:08] send with me yet thou has said I know
[44:12] thee by name and thou has also found
[44:15] grace in my sight now therefore I pray
[44:19] thee if I have found grace in thy sight
[44:21] shew me now thy way that I might know
[44:26] thee but I might find grace in thy sight
[44:28] and consider that this nation is I
[44:32] people and he said my presence shall go
[44:35] with thee and I will give thee rest and
[44:39] Moses says here and he said unto him if
[44:42] thou if thy presence go not with me
[44:45] carry us not a pence for wherein shout
[44:48] be knowing here that I and I people have
[44:51] found grace in thy sight is it not in
[44:54] the Dow has goest with us so shall we be
[44:58] separated I am thy people from all the
[45:01] people that are upon the face of the
[45:03] earth the Lord said unto Moses I will do
[45:06] this thing also that thou has spoken for
[45:08] thou has found grace in my sight and I
[45:11] know thee by name and he said I beseech
[45:15] thee show me thy glory and he said I
[45:21] will make all my goodness pass before
[45:24] thee and I'll proclaim the name of the
[45:27] Lord before thee and will be gracious to
[45:30] whom I will be gracious and will shew
[45:33] mercy on whom I will show mercy and he
[45:37] said thou Canas not see my face for
[45:40] there shall no man see me and live the
[45:43] Lord said behold there is a place by me
[45:46] that thou shalt stand upon a rock and it
[45:48] shall come to pass while my glory passes
[45:50] by that I will put me in the cleft of
[45:53] the rock and will cover thee with my
[45:55] hand whilst I pass by and I will take
[45:59] away my hand and thou shalt see my back
[46:02] parts but my face shall not be seen what
[46:07] kind of a body
[46:10] did Moses see when God passed by now
[46:16] there was a reason that he said he would
[46:19] not allow Moses to see his face
[46:21] this was speaking of a time to come when
[46:24] God would allow man to see his face but
[46:31] he looked and there was at the off and
[46:34] he body standing there that Moses saw he
[46:38] said what looked like the back parts of
[46:40] a man oh one day he came walking across
[46:46] the stage brush field to our prophet and
[46:51] he saw a man standing there and brother
[46:56] branham said looked it was on his face
[47:01] and he said the closest that he has ever
[47:05] saw was a Hoffman's head of Christ -
[47:08] depicting what he looked like turn me to
[47:16] Psalms
[47:24] Psalms chapter 27 verse 5
[47:40] for in the time of trouble shall he hide
[47:44] me in his provision and the secret of
[47:47] his Tabernacle say hide me he shall set
[47:50] me upon a rock I really brand him read
[47:53] this scripture when he preached the
[47:54] message of the rapture and the time of
[47:59] trouble that is coming is the
[48:02] tribulation period and it said but will
[48:07] be hidden during that time in his
[48:09] pavilion the secret of his tabernacle
[48:14] then he said shall he hired me he shall
[48:17] set me up upon a rock that takes place
[48:21] when you receive Jesus Christ in the
[48:25] truth of this endtime you are in the
[48:29] secret of his Tabernacle in the secret
[48:33] what is the secret of his Tabernacle
[48:35] that he isn't dwelled in the third part
[48:40] of man his soul and in the soul you have
[48:44] a relationship with Jesus Christ and
[48:47] come to know him for who he is he
[48:52] reveals himself to you turns me to 2nd
[48:59] Corinthians chapter 5 and I want to read
[49:03] verses 1 through 10
[49:09] 2nd Corinthians chapter 5 verse 1 where
[49:13] we know that in our earthly house of
[49:16] this Tabernacle if our earthly house of
[49:19] this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a
[49:21] building of God and a house not made
[49:24] with hands eternal in the heavens now
[49:27] he's talking to this tabernacle he's
[49:29] talking about is a body there's a secret
[49:36] to this tabernacle for in this we groan
[49:40] earnestly desiring to be clothed upon
[49:42] with our house which is from heaven if
[49:46] so be that being clothed we shall not be
[49:50] found nected for we that are in this
[49:53] tabernacle do groan being burped not
[49:57] that we would be unclothed but clothed
[50:00] upon that mortality might be swallowed
[50:03] up in life now he that hath wrought us
[50:07] from the self same thing is God who also
[50:10] given unto us the earnest of the Spirit
[50:13] therefore we are always confident
[50:17] knowing that whilst we are at home in
[50:19] the body we are absent from the Lord I
[50:23] was talking about this Tabernacle this
[50:26] is an earthly tabernacle says if this
[50:30] body be dissolved we've got a body
[50:33] waiting on us that was not made with
[50:35] hands and it said there's something in
[50:39] us that longs not to be unclothed
[50:45] meaning from this body but to be clothed
[50:48] with the new body to be clothed upon
[50:52] with a body that's unlike this body and
[50:56] that it's a perfect body but as long as
[51:03] he said we're in this body were absent
[51:05] from him before we walk by faith not by
[51:09] sight
[51:10] Amen I'll tell you what that is the
[51:12] Christians walk that's the key to to
[51:15] understanding the Christians walk that's
[51:18] the key to overcoming is knowing that we
[51:20] walk by faith we're not walking by
[51:25] understanding of reasoning and anytime
[51:29] that something comes to you to try to
[51:32] get you to begin to reason about things
[51:35] no all that is is the enemy trying to
[51:38] work in that reasoning gate of your
[51:41] spirit to try to trip you up because we
[51:48] walk by faith not by things we see but
[51:53] we walk by things that we do not see
[51:58] blessed is he that hath not seen yet
[52:02] believes we are confident I say willing
[52:08] rather to be absent from this body and
[52:11] to be present with the Lord wherefore we
[52:14] labour that whether present or absent we
[52:16] may be accepted of him for we must all
[52:21] appear before the judgment seat of
[52:23] Christ that every one may receive the
[52:26] things done in his body according to
[52:28] what he had done whether it be good or
[52:31] bad the scripture just told us we're
[52:37] looking for a new body a tabernacle not
[52:41] this earthly tabernacle but a tabernacle
[52:44] that's not made with hands home from the
[52:49] heaven that's the body that you will
[52:54] stand there in on that day not this body
[52:58] this mistake written written badi
[53:01] we won't stand there in this body but
[53:05] all those who do not have the earnest
[53:08] and he said the earnest of the Spirit
[53:13] who we have brought us the self same
[53:16] thing who has also given unto us the
[53:18] earnest of the Spirit those who do not
[53:20] have that will stand there in the very
[53:23] body they committed the sin in they
[53:27] won't be able to deny what they done
[53:29] because they'll be standing there in the
[53:32] body they done them I don't know about
[53:35] you but I got things that's in my memory
[53:38] that I would rather not have in my
[53:39] memory I got things that I've done that
[53:42] I wouldn't want anybody to know anything
[53:44] about sin corruption of that old man who
[53:51] I've already buried but his deeds still
[53:56] remained in my memory and it was in this
[53:59] body that those deeds were committed I'm
[54:03] glad I won't be standing there in
[54:07] [Music]
[54:09] I'm glad that I will have a body not
[54:13] made with hands a body that is metric
[54:16] oldest in the body that's never made a
[54:20] mistake
[54:20] I give glory to God for you young people
[54:25] to give your life to God in a young age
[54:27] and and never went out to taste of the
[54:30] world
[54:30] I give glory to God for you and I
[54:34] encourage you keep going forward but
[54:39] even in that you know you won't want to
[54:41] stand there at the body you're in now
[54:44] for this body you make mistakes and in
[54:51] this body this body is an imperfect body
[55:01] it grows old you'd be surprised how fast
[55:07] time passes by pardon me
[55:26] it seems like that it was only yesterday
[55:31] that I was a young man here in this
[55:34] church it doesn't seem like and there's
[55:40] there's something in me that doesn't
[55:42] feel old I know that this body gives me
[55:49] aches and pains and this body reminds me
[55:52] that I'm not a young 19 year old boy
[55:56] anymore
[55:59] well there's something in me that's
[56:01] still that same person it doesn't have
[56:09] to do with what I'm physically you're
[56:13] not physically able to do now it has to
[56:16] do it there's just something in me but
[56:19] when I look in the mirror I see a
[56:21] stranger that's that's not me that's not
[56:27] who I was I knew when I was a young man
[56:35] I was gonna lose my hair and when I got
[56:40] married I was 19 years old just a month
[56:44] from being 20 and I would tell my wife
[56:47] up when I look at him and I said he's
[56:49] still gonna love me when I lose my hair
[56:52] and she would tell me I didn't marry you
[56:55] for your hair and that was hard for me
[56:57] to understand that because I was proud
[56:58] of my hair
[56:59] I spent time combing my hair washing my
[57:05] hair and making sure it was just right
[57:08] she said when she met me she said you're
[57:10] the first person I have ever met that
[57:12] couldn't walk past his own reflection
[57:13] without checking your hair
[57:21] make sure it was in place we'd get off a
[57:24] roller coaster and I would look for a
[57:26] mirror somewhere so I can check my Hara
[57:30] maybe that's one of the reasons I had to
[57:32] lose it I was too vain maybe but that's
[57:38] a young man I remember that's who I
[57:42] remember that I am and I feel like that
[57:47] I'm still that young man just trapped in
[57:49] an old body but I'm looking forward to
[57:53] one day breaking free from these bars of
[57:59] all these walls of clay that has me
[58:04] bound I'm looking forward from breaking
[58:07] free from that thinking on those things
[58:12] I couldn't help but think about my dad
[58:17] he's already broke free from his box
[58:20] bought that house of play hallelujah we
[58:26] were helped been helping my mom to move
[58:29] into their new home and she said she
[58:33] wish dad was here and I thought the same
[58:35] thing to enjoy it but then I thought the
[58:39] what he's enjoying now is far beyond
[58:42] this world far beyond that new home that
[58:46] new house he's in a new house
[58:48] house not meet with hands I thought
[58:58] about that song there would be a song
[59:00] that would be son from the person who
[59:02] has crossed the river Jordan is on that
[59:05] other side and maybe looking over the
[59:09] banister time back at their level said I
[59:12] wish you were here and I thought if if
[59:17] he couldn't speak back to my mom though
[59:20] she said she wish he would been here to
[59:22] enjoy it he would say I wish you're with
[59:25] me to enjoy this home
[59:48] to rid me to st. John chapter 5 I want
[59:53] to read verses 24 through 32 29
[1:00:17] verse 24 verily verily I say unto you he
[1:00:22] that heareth my word and believeth on
[1:00:24] him that sent me hath everlasting life
[1:00:27] and shall not come into condemnation but
[1:00:33] is passed from death unto life verily
[1:00:37] verily I say unto you that hour is
[1:00:40] coming now watch this he speaks of three
[1:00:44] resurrections in this scriptures the
[1:00:47] hour is coming so that's a time of
[1:00:51] Resurrection that yet coming and now is
[1:00:56] so that's a second time or another
[1:01:00] different complete different time of
[1:01:02] Resurrection when the dead shall hear
[1:01:05] the voice of the Son of God and they
[1:01:08] shall live so the one is he said is yet
[1:01:12] coming but there's one that's going to
[1:01:15] happen right then the end within the
[1:01:18] hour that he's there for the dead that
[1:01:22] word
[1:01:22] from the Old Testament that died under
[1:01:25] the blood of bulls and goats when Christ
[1:01:29] came forth from the grave
[1:01:31] they came forth to and they were
[1:01:36] glorified there with him and caught up
[1:01:40] with him into heaven but there's one yet
[1:01:45] coming that's the one we're waiting on
[1:01:47] that's the one word looking forward to
[1:01:50] is that resurrection that's yet coming
[1:01:54] that time yet when the dead shall hear
[1:01:58] the voice of the Son of God and they
[1:02:01] that hear it shall live
[1:02:14] whereas the father hath life in himself
[1:02:16] so hath he given to the son to have life
[1:02:21] in himself and have given him authority
[1:02:25] to execute judgment also because he is
[1:02:29] the son of man Marvel not at this for
[1:02:33] the hour is coming now here's the third
[1:02:35] resurrection he talks about for the hour
[1:02:38] is coming in the which that which all
[1:02:43] that are in the graves shall hear his
[1:02:46] voice now the ones that are going to
[1:02:50] hear his voice in this resurrection will
[1:02:52] wait on right now are those who have
[1:02:55] received eternal life that have passed
[1:02:57] from death unto life and they shall not
[1:03:02] come into the judgment because they've
[1:03:06] already been judged here before they
[1:03:09] died and went on so when they come forth
[1:03:13] in that resurrection they're not coming
[1:03:15] forth in a state in which they can be
[1:03:18] condemned in because they will not come
[1:03:22] into the condemnation but these he's
[1:03:25] speaking of here into 28 verse Marvel
[1:03:28] not for the hours coming which all then
[1:03:31] in a degrade shall hear his voice and
[1:03:33] shall come forth they that have done
[1:03:36] good unto the resurrection of life and
[1:03:39] they that have done evil unto the
[1:03:40] resurrection of damnation
[1:03:45] that is the third resurrection the
[1:03:49] resurrection of all the ones who
[1:03:53] resurrect in this resurrection we're
[1:03:56] waiting on are the ones that we will be
[1:03:59] changed with and caught up together to
[1:04:04] meet Christ in there those are the ones
[1:04:08] we'll be with at the wedding supper and
[1:04:11] we'll be there in a body and we'll set
[1:04:16] there and we'll protect of the wedding
[1:04:18] supper
[1:04:20] the marriage supper of the Lamb oh what
[1:04:26] a time of fellowship that will be
[1:04:32] there's a picture of my mother has that
[1:04:35] she's had since I was just a young boy
[1:04:37] and it shows a table and it's supposed
[1:04:41] to be the table of the marriage supper
[1:04:43] of the Lamb
[1:04:43] it seems like it just stretches on and
[1:04:46] on and on and on in the picture
[1:04:48] somehow when they made this picture they
[1:04:51] made it in such a way that it seems like
[1:04:54] the table is never in meat maybe many of
[1:04:57] you have solved such a picture and I
[1:05:00] think of that and I think you know I
[1:05:05] don't care who was sitting around me
[1:05:07] maybe I said that when I was here the
[1:05:08] last time I don't care who's sitting by
[1:05:11] me I just want to be there and I know
[1:05:16] this brother branham said and I think I
[1:05:18] read the quote to you when I was here
[1:05:19] last and when you receive Christ there's
[1:05:23] a place for you at that table he said
[1:05:28] where you'll pull your feet up under it
[1:05:35] but in the general resurrection the
[1:05:38] third one that he's speaking of those
[1:05:41] people they will miss they're going to
[1:05:45] miss the rapture they're going to miss
[1:05:50] the Millenium they'll miss the marriage
[1:05:53] supper and they'll miss the time of the
[1:05:55] millennium because they will not come up
[1:05:58] until after the thousand years has
[1:06:01] passed then shall all the Dead come
[1:06:05] forth those that have done good unto a
[1:06:09] resurrection of life you said could it
[1:06:13] be those that's done good and yet don't
[1:06:15] make the rapture yes because they were
[1:06:20] not in Christ they never had that
[1:06:24] complete relationship with Jesus Christ
[1:06:30] remember there is a foolish virgin who
[1:06:35] was virgin
[1:06:36] only lacked the oil and there are those
[1:06:42] that the Prophet spoke of he said that
[1:06:45] when that resurrection takes place the
[1:06:47] general resurrection there will be those
[1:06:49] that come up that have done good to the
[1:06:52] bride and have been good to the bride
[1:06:56] and the members of the bride will step
[1:06:59] forward and say father they were good to
[1:07:02] us they were good to me and they'll
[1:07:06] receive eternal life there but there's
[1:07:10] others because all comes forth and those
[1:07:13] that have done evil they come forth and
[1:07:15] they stand there in the body that they
[1:07:18] committed the evil in even these ones
[1:07:23] that come forth that have done good and
[1:07:26] come forth the resurrection of life they
[1:07:29] are standing there in the body they
[1:07:30] lived in here and then we receive
[1:07:36] eternal life with those that have done
[1:07:42] evil they stand there in the body that
[1:07:44] they committed the evil in and they
[1:07:50] won't be able to point a finger at you
[1:07:52] because you will not be there in this
[1:07:55] body you will not be there in this form
[1:08:00] it will be a full of flesh but different
[1:08:04] than what we are now then then it will
[1:08:07] be perfect it will be glorified
[1:08:26] I love preaching about this so in case
[1:08:31] you couldn't tell
[1:08:35] the Librium says this animus of who is
[1:08:38] this Mikasa dick and I've read a lot
[1:08:40] through this message of who's this
[1:08:41] Melchizedek fine these are many things
[1:08:45] it's a good message you want to listen
[1:08:49] to a message after hearing this go
[1:08:51] listen to that one when the theophany
[1:09:02] Moses seen him Exodus 33 2 he wasn't the
[1:09:07] apne Moses wanted to see God he had
[1:09:12] heard his voice heard him talk to him
[1:09:17] seen him in the bush there as a big
[1:09:21] pillar of fire and he said who are you I
[1:09:24] want to know who you are
[1:09:27] Moses said if you'll let me see you I
[1:09:31] would like to see your face and he said
[1:09:34] no man can see my face he said I'll put
[1:09:38] my hand over your eyes and I'll pass by
[1:09:41] and you can see my back but not my face
[1:09:44] and when he did it it was the back of a
[1:09:48] man it was at the often II then the word
[1:09:52] that come to Moses I am that was the
[1:09:56] word the word came to Moses in the form
[1:09:59] of a pillar of fire and in a burning
[1:10:01] bush the I am as the word from the
[1:10:07] theophany
[1:10:09] he came to Abraham as a man under the
[1:10:13] oak tree now look there came a man who
[1:10:17] they ever had three of them sat down
[1:10:20] under an oak tree three of them and
[1:10:22] noticed after he talked to Abraham why
[1:10:25] did he come ever have been one with
[1:10:29] promise and the message of the coming
[1:10:33] Sun and also he was gods
[1:10:37] profit that was trusting God's Word
[1:10:44] calling anything contrary as though it
[1:10:47] wasn't see how perfect the word is the
[1:10:52] word came to the prophet see there was
[1:10:55] God and at theophany the Bible said the
[1:10:58] word come to the Prophet and here was
[1:11:02] the word in the theophany now you say
[1:11:05] was that God Abraham said it was he said
[1:11:10] his name was he he called him out on him
[1:11:14] now Genesis 1 you find out in the
[1:11:17] beginning element created heavens and
[1:11:19] earth in Genesis 18 we find out that
[1:11:23] Abraham called this person and they're
[1:11:26] set there and talked to him and could
[1:11:28] tell him the secrets of his heart tell
[1:11:32] him that Sarah was thinking behind him
[1:11:34] ever have said its ello him he was in it
[1:11:38] the often e-form
[1:11:39] you get it now we find out that he was
[1:11:44] then in the theophany form he called him
[1:11:46] Lord God lol
[1:11:48] now in Genesis 18 we find that it's true
[1:11:53] and notice Abraham there was three of
[1:11:55] them together but when Abraham met the
[1:11:58] three he sent my lord
[1:12:00] but when lot down in Sodom two of them
[1:12:03] went down their lot saw two of them
[1:12:05] coming he said my Lords she what was the
[1:12:10] matter the first place luck was not a
[1:12:12] prophet that's right
[1:12:14] neither was he a messenger of the hour
[1:12:16] so he didn't have any revelation of him
[1:12:22] lot not being part of the bride that
[1:12:29] Abraham is the type of Abraham and Sarah
[1:12:36] typed those who are going to receive a
[1:12:38] body change
[1:12:42] lot types those who are not going to
[1:12:45] receive a body challenge before company
[1:12:50] in that resurrection lot the see was not
[1:12:56] a profit that's right
[1:12:58] neither was he the messenger the hour so
[1:13:00] he didn't have any revelation of him
[1:13:02] it's exactly right lot called them lords
[1:13:07] could have been a dozen of them and he
[1:13:09] still said Lords but no matter how many
[1:13:13] Abraham saw it was still one Lord there
[1:13:17] is God
[1:13:18] this was the Melchizedek notice after
[1:13:22] the battles over Melchizedek served the
[1:13:24] victorious child communion think of that
[1:13:28] part of himself now we want to see here
[1:13:31] in the types here in view the communion
[1:13:34] after the battle he gave of himself
[1:13:37] because the communion is part of Christ
[1:13:40] and after the struggle is over after
[1:13:44] you've done got yourself whipped out
[1:13:46] then when you partake of Christ and
[1:13:49] become part of this beam he serves us of
[1:13:56] himself that brings to light except you
[1:14:01] eat the flesh drink the blood of the son
[1:14:04] of man you have no life in you now we
[1:14:14] see the attribute sons of his spirit not
[1:14:18] enter into the ward form body but if he
[1:14:21] often he the body is subject to the word
[1:14:25] earnest waiting for the earnest change
[1:14:27] of the body now the difference between
[1:14:30] him and you as a son see he was at the
[1:14:34] beginning to worry speaking about Christ
[1:14:36] in morph a body he came in and lived in
[1:14:42] that in the person of Melchizedek then
[1:14:44] later we never hear no more of
[1:14:47] Melchizedek because he became Jesus
[1:14:49] Christ
[1:14:50] no cousin ik was the priest but he
[1:14:53] became Jesus Christ
[1:14:55] now you bypassed that you cook like Adam
[1:15:00] like me you became from the attribute of
[1:15:03] flesh to be tempted but when this life
[1:15:08] is finished here if this earthly
[1:15:10] tabernacle be dissolved we have one
[1:15:13] already waiting that's where we go that
[1:15:17] is the word now we can look back and see
[1:15:20] what we done now we don't understand it
[1:15:24] we never become the word we've just
[1:15:27] become the flesh man not the work but
[1:15:30] look and clearly makes it clear you will
[1:15:34] never be the word unless you were a
[1:15:37] thought at the beginning that proves the
[1:15:40] predestination of God you kept me word
[1:15:43] unless you're a thought you had to be in
[1:15:46] the thinking first but you see in order
[1:15:50] to stand temptation you had to bypass
[1:15:53] the theophany you had to come down to
[1:15:57] here in flesh to be tempted by sin and
[1:16:00] then if you stand all the father hath
[1:16:03] given me will come to me and I will
[1:16:05] raise him up at the last days see you
[1:16:08] had to be first so in order to be able
[1:16:14] to know you have that theophany body you
[1:16:17] first must have been in his thoughts if
[1:16:22] you if the person was not in his
[1:16:25] thoughts predestinated bride of in these
[1:16:33] ages and they don't have a theophany
[1:16:37] waiting now listen to this then after
[1:16:44] you've recognized the very word of God
[1:16:46] was eagle food then you left the other
[1:16:49] thing you have been formed into a living
[1:16:52] image of living God you heard from your
[1:16:55] theophany
[1:16:57] if the certainly body be dissolved we
[1:17:01] have one waiting how do I know I have a
[1:17:05] theophany because I heard this word and
[1:17:09] I recognize it to be true because in the
[1:17:13] face of all that are falling away from
[1:17:15] this endtime truth and they're turning
[1:17:17] their backs on it and walking away and
[1:17:20] saying things against it we still stand
[1:17:24] quiet because it wasn't just some new
[1:17:29] thing that we did it wasn't just some
[1:17:32] new traction that we do it was a
[1:17:46] revelation
[1:17:53] well devil I'm gonna preach it anyhow
[1:17:57] [Applause]
[1:18:13] that's just old body testified we heard
[1:18:24] from our theology it wasn't just us
[1:18:27] trying out something new we heard from
[1:18:37] something that let us know this in time
[1:18:41] it was true and people can say well what
[1:18:45] about this this seems like a discrepancy
[1:18:47] no aside what about this what about the
[1:18:53] parts in the scripture which seem to be
[1:18:55] if you would have been standing there on
[1:18:58] the date when he said except you eat the
[1:19:00] flesh of the son of man and drink his
[1:19:01] blood you have no part with him no life
[1:19:04] what would we have thought we look at
[1:19:08] that Scripture now we have understanding
[1:19:10] of that Scripture but they didn't have
[1:19:12] it then they didn't know and they
[1:19:16] weren't supposed to know until after
[1:19:20] Jesus was glorified then after he was
[1:19:26] glorified then they come to know what it
[1:19:28] meant
[1:19:30] they even when he served them communion
[1:19:34] they still hadn't caught the connection
[1:19:37] between except he deflesh the son of man
[1:19:40] and the communion they hadn't caught the
[1:19:43] connection he was until after where he
[1:19:45] was glorified that they got they
[1:19:47] received the earnest of the Spirit
[1:19:51] they couldn't receive the Holy Ghost
[1:19:53] until after Jesus was glorified
[1:20:01] and after you recognize the very word of
[1:20:04] God was eagle food you left the other
[1:20:06] thing and you know what I'm not going
[1:20:10] back to the other thing there I don't
[1:20:18] care how many go back I'm not returning
[1:20:21] back to that vomit I have received
[1:20:29] revelation that this is true and it goes
[1:20:32] beyond words and you know something just
[1:20:34] you don't have to be able to explain it
[1:20:37] in order to say I've received a
[1:20:39] revelation that is true somebody can
[1:20:43] come up to you and friends look some of
[1:20:45] them could come up and try to stump you
[1:20:46] this is the thing I have received the
[1:20:49] revelation that this is eagle food
[1:20:52] what's the difference between you and
[1:20:54] them you heard from your theophany
[1:21:00] that's why you know it's true not just
[1:21:05] because you heard it with these ears and
[1:21:09] understood it with this heart but
[1:21:13] because there was something of
[1:21:15] representation of you that was on the
[1:21:17] other side that's there waiting for you
[1:21:20] and it spoke to you there was a deep
[1:21:24] talk and a deep inside responded
[1:21:29] [Applause]
[1:21:35] hallelujah you heard from your theophany
[1:21:39] you say is that right brother Branham
[1:21:42] let's take a couple of Evil's and look
[1:21:44] at them for a few minutes there was a
[1:21:48] name a man called Moses everyone knows
[1:21:51] that a prophet is called the eagle in
[1:21:53] the Bible there was a prophet named
[1:21:56] Moses one day God called him and
[1:21:59] wouldn't let him go over to the land and
[1:22:01] he died up on a rock and the angels
[1:22:05] packed him away
[1:22:08] remember in Jude it speaks about the
[1:22:13] devil contending with Michael over the
[1:22:15] body of Moses why because he said the
[1:22:19] devil said I have a claim to all that
[1:22:22] dies under the blood of bulls and goats
[1:22:24] I am taking him captive there has not
[1:22:32] been a price paid for sin Michael
[1:22:45] wouldn't contend with him how did
[1:22:50] Michael just rebuked him and the Angels
[1:22:54] went ahead and pack Moses body away
[1:22:58] didn't don't argue with the devil
[1:23:01] don't try to reason it out with him
[1:23:04] don't even bother with it just go on
[1:23:08] because you know who you are why is this
[1:23:15] happening why is that happening why
[1:23:16] because you're in a body of flesh to be
[1:23:19] tested and there's times of sickness
[1:23:23] brother Adam said sometimes sickness
[1:23:25] comes on just to test your faith so that
[1:23:29] when you have loved that victory you to
[1:23:33] look back say nobody can tell me the
[1:23:36] spot so nobody can tell me he's not a
[1:23:39] healer because I have witnessed it by
[1:23:43] faith
[1:23:44] [Applause]
[1:23:59] there was another Eagle didn't even have
[1:24:04] to die he just walked across Jordan and
[1:24:08] God sent a chariot down and this roll of
[1:24:12] flesh he dropped it and rise and caught
[1:24:16] the everlasting prize eight hundred
[1:24:21] years later eight hundred years later on
[1:24:25] Mount Transfiguration here stood two men
[1:24:29] Moses body had been rotting for hundreds
[1:24:33] of years but here he was in such a form
[1:24:37] till even Peter James and John
[1:24:39] recognized him
[1:24:40] if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved
[1:24:43] if you're an attribute of God expressed
[1:24:46] here on earth you've got a body waiting
[1:24:49] after you leave this world their days
[1:24:53] was standing on Mount Transfiguration
[1:24:56] the theophany for they were prophets to
[1:25:00] whom the word came hallelujah this is a
[1:25:10] mess of questions and answers Co D book
[1:25:14] 6200 527 now here is another one the
[1:25:19] second is like this what manner of body
[1:25:23] were the wicked have in the last
[1:25:25] resurrection at the great white throne
[1:25:27] judgment that sinner will rise in the
[1:25:30] resurrection to be judged in a body that
[1:25:33] he has committed the sin in he'll have
[1:25:36] to stand the judgment in the
[1:25:39] resurrection resurrection is not a
[1:25:42] replacement
[1:25:43] it's a bringing up that which went down
[1:25:45] when Jesus raised from the dead he was
[1:25:48] the same body that went down he raised
[1:25:51] in that same kind of a body we rise in
[1:25:54] the same body that we go down in it's a
[1:25:57] resurrection not a replacement now the
[1:26:00] Bible says that we will be judged
[1:26:03] according to the sins done in the body
[1:26:06] even the wicked rises you'll be judged
[1:26:09] in that same body that he sinned
[1:26:11] the same thing now for the random speaks
[1:26:24] in another place that says you first
[1:26:26] must have a spiritual resurrection
[1:26:28] before you ever have a natural
[1:26:30] resurrection now
[1:26:33] they go down those that died here during
[1:26:38] this time in Christ they go down in this
[1:26:42] body that they've lived in but when that
[1:26:45] body comes up it's not replaced but
[1:26:47] there's something different about it
[1:26:48] there's gonna be something different
[1:26:50] about that body then let's read Saint
[1:26:56] John in Chapter 7 verse 37 through 39
[1:27:07] now we've been studying about the
[1:27:09] theophany as the body you receive when
[1:27:13] you leave here if you die and you leave
[1:27:15] here it's a body that you hear from when
[1:27:19] you receive this to be true and it's a
[1:27:23] body that you will have but it's not the
[1:27:26] body you will stand into the
[1:27:27] resurrection it's not that can we put it
[1:27:29] this way it's not the complete body
[1:27:39] in the last days that great day of the
[1:27:41] feast Jesus stood and cried and said if
[1:27:43] any man thirst let him come unto me and
[1:27:45] drink he that believeth on me as the
[1:27:49] scripture hath said out of his belly
[1:27:50] shall flow rivers of living water but
[1:27:54] this spake he of the Spirit which day
[1:27:57] that believed on him should receive
[1:27:59] where the Holy Ghost was not yet given
[1:28:02] because Jesus was not yet glorified
[1:28:06] Saint John 12 verse 16 these things
[1:28:14] understood not his disciples at first
[1:28:16] but when Jesus was glorified then they
[1:28:19] remembered that these things were
[1:28:22] written of him that they had done these
[1:28:24] things unto him so the disciples did not
[1:28:29] have complete understanding even while
[1:28:31] in Jesus was walking with them here on
[1:28:34] earth it wasn't until after he was
[1:28:36] glorified and they received the spirit
[1:28:40] which he said the Spirit will bring back
[1:28:43] to your remembrance everything that I've
[1:28:45] said unto you this look in st. John
[1:28:53] chapter 20 verses 14 through 17
[1:29:14] when she dust said she turned herself
[1:29:17] back and saw Jesus standing and knew not
[1:29:20] that it was Jesus Jesus sent her to her
[1:29:23] woman why weepest thou whom seekest thou
[1:29:27] she supposed him to be the gardener she
[1:29:31] saith unto him sir if thou hath borne
[1:29:33] him hence tell me where thou hast laid
[1:29:36] him and I will take him away and Jesus
[1:29:39] said unto her Mary she turned herself
[1:29:42] and saith unto Him rabona which means to
[1:29:46] say master and he said unto her touch me
[1:29:51] not for I am not yet ascended to my
[1:29:54] father but go to my brethren and say
[1:29:57] unto them I ascend unto my father and
[1:30:01] your father and to my god and your God
[1:30:06] so here he is risen from the dead
[1:30:10] and he is in a body but that body has
[1:30:15] not yet ascended to the Father that body
[1:30:18] has not yet been glorified all it did
[1:30:22] was resurrect the body that he had died
[1:30:26] in but he had not a sin unto the Father
[1:30:32] yet he said touch me not but then later
[1:30:37] when he appears to them later and Thomas
[1:30:40] says if it's you Lord let me touch the
[1:30:44] nail scars in your hands then he allowed
[1:30:47] them to touch him
[1:30:53] cover me to Romans 8 chapter 16 I want
[1:30:57] to read 16 through 23
[1:31:12] verse 16 the spirit itself bear witness
[1:31:14] with our spirit that we are the children
[1:31:16] of God and if children then heirs heirs
[1:31:19] of God joint heirs with Christ if so be
[1:31:24] that we suffer with him that we may be
[1:31:27] also glorified together for I reckon
[1:31:31] that the sufferings of this present time
[1:31:32] are not worthy to be compared with the
[1:31:34] glory which shall be revealed in us not
[1:31:37] to us but in us for the earnest
[1:31:41] expectation of the creature waiteth for
[1:31:43] the manifestation of the sons of God all
[1:31:46] of creation is waiting for us to be
[1:31:50] manifested in a body for the creature
[1:32:00] was made subject to vanity not willing
[1:32:02] but by reason of him who had subjected
[1:32:05] the same in Hope because the creature
[1:32:08] itself also shall be delivered from the
[1:32:11] bondage of corruption into the glorious
[1:32:14] liberty of the children of God for we
[1:32:18] know that the whole creation groaneth
[1:32:20] and travaileth in pain together until
[1:32:23] now not only they but ourselves also
[1:32:27] which have the firstfruits of the Spirit
[1:32:30] even we ourselves groan within ourselves
[1:32:35] waiting for the adoption to wit the
[1:32:38] redemption of our body message of
[1:32:45] expectation brother Branham says now we
[1:32:48] think be for the grace of God to know
[1:32:52] that one time we were aliens cut off
[1:32:54] from God without mercy without hope
[1:32:56] Christ died for us
[1:32:58] in our stead bearing our reproach and
[1:33:00] sins in his own body and knowing someday
[1:33:03] that he shall come we do not know what
[1:33:07] we shall be like but we know we'll have
[1:33:10] a body like his for we shall see him as
[1:33:14] he is and father that'll be a glorified
[1:33:18] body free from sickness and sorrow and
[1:33:22] partings and death
[1:33:24] our spirits grown for that deliverance
[1:33:28] so now he's speaking about a glorified
[1:33:31] body Philippians chapter 3
[1:33:53] first or to begin reading at verse 17 17
[1:34:00] down through 21 brother and be follow us
[1:34:04] together of me and mark them which walk
[1:34:07] so as ye have us for an example for many
[1:34:12] walk of whom I have told you often and
[1:34:14] now tell you even weeping that they are
[1:34:18] the enemies of the cross of Christ whose
[1:34:22] end is destruction whose God is their
[1:34:25] belly and whose glory is their shame who
[1:34:29] mind earthly things for our conversation
[1:34:34] is in heaven from whence also we look
[1:34:37] for the Savior the Lord Jesus Christ who
[1:34:41] shall change our vile body that it may
[1:34:44] be fashioned like his glorious body
[1:34:46] according to the working whereby he is
[1:34:49] able even to subdue all things unto
[1:34:52] himself so as he received a glorified
[1:34:59] body so shall we
[1:35:10] Romans 8:29 Romans 8:29 and 30 or whom
[1:35:21] he did foreknow he did also predestinate
[1:35:24] to be conformed to the image of his son
[1:35:26] that he might be the firstborn among
[1:35:28] many brother moreover whom he did
[1:35:31] predestinate them he also called and
[1:35:33] whom he called then he also justified
[1:35:36] and whom he justified them he also
[1:35:38] glorified now those that have died and
[1:35:46] went on and are coming up in this
[1:35:47] resurrection we're waiting on they are
[1:35:50] in a theophany form now then they come
[1:35:55] back here to what to receive a glorified
[1:35:59] body and what is that glorified body
[1:36:03] it's this flesh except that this flesh
[1:36:08] the sixteen elements that make up this
[1:36:10] flesh the molecules of it they're out of
[1:36:13] order that's why we grow old that's why
[1:36:18] we get sick that's why we suffer that's
[1:36:21] why we have pain is because the the
[1:36:24] alignment of the molecules was thrown
[1:36:27] off when man fell just as the molecular
[1:36:32] structure of the serpent changed there
[1:36:35] was a lecture structure of man that
[1:36:38] changed because the Bible said that God
[1:36:41] said in the day you eat thereof that day
[1:36:44] he shall die no man has ever lived a
[1:36:49] thousand years Methuselah lived nine
[1:36:52] hundred and some years he was the oldest
[1:36:54] one ever but no man has ever lived one
[1:36:59] day in that day that were born in that
[1:37:03] same thousand years we die why because
[1:37:10] of the fall
[1:37:13] we were not meant to die we were not
[1:37:17] created to die but we're being restored
[1:37:21] back to the original this body is
[1:37:29] suffers now but it was not so at the
[1:37:31] beginning this body feels pain now but
[1:37:36] it was not so at the beginning this body
[1:37:42] gets sick but it was not so at the
[1:37:47] beginning so in the resurrection that
[1:37:55] molecular structure of the body is
[1:37:57] changed back to the way God created it
[1:38:02] and all the aging disappears all the
[1:38:12] things of the body being bent over
[1:38:14] crooked or whatever it disappears and
[1:38:21] what is it then a glorified body a body
[1:38:25] of flesh that doesn't grow old that
[1:38:29] doesn't get sick that doesn't feel pain
[1:38:33] that doesn't feel sorrow that cannot die
[1:38:39] an eternal body that theophany therein
[1:38:46] is waiting to be clothed upon with flesh
[1:38:50] again but a glorified flesh hallelujah
[1:38:59] all right I got just a couple of more
[1:39:01] quotes here
[1:39:03] man
[1:39:09] questions and answers one 1954 paragraph
[1:39:15] 107 he says those whom he called he
[1:39:19] justified those whom he justified he
[1:39:22] glorified and every redeemed person in
[1:39:26] this world this morning that's under the
[1:39:28] blood of Jesus Christ filled with the
[1:39:30] Holy Ghost past everlasting life and can
[1:39:33] you not perish it is already in heavenly
[1:39:36] places with Christ Jesus and shall never
[1:39:40] come into combination already redeemed
[1:39:43] isn't that wonderful seeing already
[1:39:45] redeemed setting in heavenly places now
[1:39:48] with Christ and glorified already
[1:39:51] glorified you say brother bill does the
[1:39:56] scripture say that Jesus said that or
[1:39:59] the scripture says that were the wid
[1:40:00] riders Paul he said those who he
[1:40:04] justified he has already glorified those
[1:40:08] whom he fore ordained he predestinated
[1:40:10] those who he predestinated he justified
[1:40:13] and those whom he justified he has
[1:40:16] already glorified what is it
[1:40:19] oh my excuse me already glorified then
[1:40:24] if we are filled with the Holy Ghost our
[1:40:27] fibers and beings are already been
[1:40:29] preserved in God there is a glorified
[1:40:32] body already waiting and you have to go
[1:40:36] to it as soon as this is over those whom
[1:40:39] he's justified he's all ready glorified
[1:40:44] so we already have a glorified body
[1:40:48] who's he talking about now those of us
[1:40:51] that are alive and remain unto the
[1:40:54] coming of the Lord we have a glorified
[1:40:58] body what is it this body the molecular
[1:41:04] structure of its gonna change and when
[1:41:07] it does age fades
[1:41:13] all the signs of age is gone this body
[1:41:20] changes back into the perfect image that
[1:41:25] he saw you in about the age of 19 years
[1:41:28] old hallelujah thanks ash is one 1954
[1:41:39] paragraph 263 just state the very Lord
[1:41:44] Jesus that was back there in the days of
[1:41:46] the Apostles is right here now and it's
[1:41:50] just winding up the end of the Gentiles
[1:41:52] a great move is going amongst the
[1:41:55] supernatural believers because we
[1:41:57] believe that God is here just think
[1:42:01] you're glorified bodies right here at
[1:42:04] the Tabernacle now the presence of the
[1:42:08] Holy Spirit which is your glorified
[1:42:10] condition your glorified in Christ right
[1:42:14] now those whom he justified he glorified
[1:42:18] and your own glorified body is standing
[1:42:21] near you right now in Christ to give you
[1:42:25] strength like a charge going into a
[1:42:28] battery the holy spirits the holy
[1:42:32] spirits in you it's to charge your body
[1:42:36] to give you new strength to heal you
[1:42:39] from sickness that you've got to make
[1:42:41] you well so while we're in this state
[1:42:47] there is something in order to give us
[1:42:51] charge like to charge into a battery to
[1:42:54] heal this body from sickness why because
[1:43:02] there's something there that's
[1:43:04] testifying of an unsick body
[1:43:07] there's something standing there is
[1:43:09] testifying of glorious glorious state
[1:43:13] that he has for us in what body in what
[1:43:24] body that's the body we're waiting on
[1:43:32] I love reaching on this subject I'll
[1:43:40] tell you what I didn't know exactly what
[1:43:44] I was gonna preach this morning when I
[1:43:48] was out I was kind of between two
[1:43:50] messages and I didn't know which one and
[1:43:53] when I got here I just was sorting
[1:43:55] through my folder and felt pulled to
[1:43:59] open this one up these notes as they
[1:44:02] begin to read the notes the devil begin
[1:44:04] to fight me in the back I believe he was
[1:44:07] reading over my shoulder my nose started
[1:44:09] bleeding back there I prayed God stopped
[1:44:11] it from bleeding so I could read over my
[1:44:14] notes did that same devil you tried to
[1:44:18] stop it from coming forth but I was
[1:44:23] determined I needed that the more I knew
[1:44:31] that the more he fought me the more I
