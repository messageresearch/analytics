anything's able to able to happen amen no matter what our our needs are amen God is mindful amen all that we have to do is just believe amen mine it's just so precious amen I have what to say we I know I greeted you on Thursday night but we certainly appreciate your prayers while we were gone and uh we uh are just thankful I for brother Alex and brother Stephen and why they did a tremendous job and uh you know I I just hearing all the good reports well that just I'm just thankful amen you know when uh when even our um our children and our family go and you know there's things that I see like where doctors or different ones can help them and teachers and they say Dad I really like this teacher you know Zachary has certain ones that he met he said man I just really like them and to me it's precious when that connection is made because they're getting help amen and we're just we're thankful because it all comes from the Lord and we're just so grateful for that and amen and I think it's tremendous to be able to look Beyond a veil and be able to recognize God you know that's why when we look at it when the Lord Jesus stepped out on the road to Emmaus he began to walk with him their eyes were holding from him they didn't know it was him but he began to take his word and began to open his word their hearts begin to burn and then when he made as though he was going to go on the constrained said father said come stay with us he was still a stranger but they were bidding this stranger who had spoke to them and it so stirred their hearts no you've got to come in and when they invited him in then he made known who he was and through all of that he's the god that takes care of his word I'm glad he's watching over his word aren't you glad he's watching over over us and I love that scripture in the Psalms David said thou Hast exalted Thy Word above thy name and yet his name is called the word of God [Music] never varies never changes he's the same yesterday a day and forever aren't you glad that what he has said he will perform amen and that's the manifestation of his name that's his character that's who he's is so when we say the Lord Jesus Christ we know he's the faithful one amen the high priest our high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities amen you know when he came and got a hold of Our Lives he wasn't afraid to get his hands dirty he wasn't afraid to roll up his sleeves and go to work on us but he knew what it would take and and not only knew what it would take but how he's still working on us my mind what love is this what love is this amen we want to just offer a word of prayer here this morning brother Vivian you your children you'd like to have your children dedicated there to the Lord and so brother Vivian's children they are here from Chicago correct or Illinois Illinois so we want to just dedicate them to the Lord and so if we could as they will come and let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer if you'd like to come and so good to have you all here amen so good to have you [Music] you know you're sitting back there what's your name Ellie you know you look like your father I I it's okay you look God bless you what's your name Mario God bless you nice to meet you what's your name Esther wonderful God bless you good to have you all here amen we're just going to offer a word of prayer and you know just dedicating your lives to the Lord and just all of your goings all of your doings and just say Lord just be the Lord of every part of my life and we just want to dedicate ourselves to him he's watching over your lives you believe that amen let's just dedicate it to the Lord Heavenly Father dear God I realize that standing here before us Lord your stands young man young lady yes Lord a little girl and dear God with the desire of the father that their lives would be dedicated to you I'm grateful Lord that there's never anything Lord that's too late but God we can dedicate Our Lives to you we ask God that you would just Lord take each one of their lives Lord right where they're at in this stage in this season of their life and I pray that God that you would make yourself so real to them Lord may you keep your hand upon them Lord and watch over them Lord may you be the influence Lord when other things would want to come their way and may you be the source of influence God that would cause them to look Beyond Lord decisions that might be very pleasurable but they would look Lord to see where will this road lead me God I pray that you'll just move by your spirit that their feet would be turned Lord to your testimonies Lord Turn to You Lord and in simple simple obedience just to Lord follow you Lord heed to your voice each day each moment of their life Lord and God we ask that you'll fulfill your work in their lives we pray we ask it Lord as we dedicate their lives to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you so good to have you all and bless you amen [Music] amen God bless you amen if we could let's just stand and we want to go into the word of the Lord here this morning amen I want to say as you would turn with me if you would to Second Peter chapter one I just want to say I we didn't get to make many comments but boy I think that that porch is coming along really nicely it's looking really really good and we just so appreciate that and thankful to all the the brothers and the laboring and the work and I know brother Richie has been sneaking over here after his job and doing that and and uh well we just are are thankful to the Lord I know there's some others I don't mean to miss anybody but uh so even if you've held a nail God bless your heart amen and uh so we just everything together and and we we're a body we work together is that right brother Brian I've got just a little bit of just don't cut me out completely but just a little bit of ring here just you if you'll take care of that for me um sorry sometimes I don't know how we there's different adjustments that come and the sound men get blamed if there's anything that goes wrong but uh oh somebody just cut me out completely here so um let's read here in second Peter chapter one and verse 12. and I just want to read just this one verse of scripture here and um just take a little thought from here this morning wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though you know them and be established in the present truth I want to just read that again and Peter in these the scriptures that are preceding before here he's talking about a walk with God that is fruitful that's abounding in the grace of God but I just want to draw our attention here this morning in verse 12. where Peter is speaking to them regarding those things and says I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things how many of you like to be reminded I mean now there's sometimes I sometimes to be reminded of things I'm like I know I see it in front of me it says 35 miles per hour I'm going 35 miles per hour but you know and the turn's coming up I know the turn's coming up here some of you know what I'm referring to but there's times that we are thankful and I tell you when you make the right turn you know or you make the wrong turn you're like where was she at but it was good to be reminded isn't it and you know that's the thing with God God he comes to remind us not that it would become repetitive in where we can just simply repeat it but God comes to stir us up and there's a constant growing and developing in our life but this is where it all originates from though you know them and be established in the present truth and I want to just speak just one word this morning on established established and this word established here if you'll let me just read this before we just offer a word of Prayer it's it's to be established or established or steadfastly set it's to make stable place firmly set fast or fix to set one's face steadfastly remember Jesus when he was going to Calvary he set his face steadfastly those in Samaria got upset is that right but he said his face steadfastly keep the face turned it's to strengthen to make firm to render constant and confirm one's mind and that that not only is something that's done initially but this last part and there's no way we can look at this this morning but that continues to take place in our life God continues to establish us continues to make us stronger amen so let's just offer a word of prayer here this morning and I know we all have needs and let's just invite him to come by our way and just speak to us this morning Heavenly follower Lord we are so privileged Lord to God to be gathered together here this morning in your presence we just invite you Lord what a what a lord a wonderful atmosphere oh God and we know that that was not Lord the piano or the organ or any instrument that created that atmosphere but God there's a there's a a praise Lord in the hearts of your children there's a Thanksgiving Lord there's an expectation Lord and father it's you that we've come to Worship in spirit and in truth and Lord you dwell in the Praises of your people and we just invite you Lord this morning that you'll take control of Lord the speaker and the hearing God just move Among Us in a special way there's only one desire that we have is that you'd be glorified and that your word Lord would find its Mark Lord in our hearts and our lives Lord we love you and we thank you now Lord we commit Lord every every doing Lord we committed into your hands Lord in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you as you're being seated foreign when we think of this word to be established we recognize that it's something that it's not to be transient and just moved about and so when you think of this all through the scriptures God would always desire and would and would establish his Covenant he would establish his word and that word establishes to worry he confirms it and God God declares himself faithful and you know once God as God declares himself faithful uh that in itself is something that then where there comes an experience of Faith by an experience to believe God for every situation for every need and it's a work of God uh Faith itself is not the work of man it's God's work and so to be established and to think of how that God would his desire would be to bring man to this place of establishment and I want to go to the scriptures because to be established it would lead us here into the scripture of Matthew 11 28 and brother brown or the scripture says come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light remember God had an objective for Israel that they would come out of Egypt and they would be established in the promised land that would be the rest that would be the type of the Holy Spirit and to to remain there and we realize that that that in itself being a type of what God would do for us to bring us into the promised land of the Holy Spirit to where that we would become established in him established in the word of God and I I want to draw from as we look at this thought I'm going to read here a quite a a a piece out of the message why people are so tossed about and brother Branham is drawing from this here and I want us just to make just to draw from this a few moments brother Brian said I he said he's he was speaking to his wife he says the Christian faith is based solidly upon rest that's right a Christian is not tossed about a Christian doesn't run from place to place a Christian doesn't fuss and fume and worry about things a Christian rest it's all over it's all finished for the believer at Calvary I won't ask you to raise your hand but there's problem there might even be some things this morning that thoughts have come to you with things that you might have tomorrow that could be a little worrisome so it doesn't mean that worry can't come but for a Christian you have something on the inside that's able to tap the worry down that's what a rest is something so that when things do come there is that which is able to put it right back in its place so it's it's all I love this it's all over it's all finished for the believer at Calvary sickness may come disappointments but the Christians at rest knowing this that God's able to keep that which he has performed knowing no matter what the thing is or how it looks there's neither sickness sorrow death there's neither starvation or anything that can separate us from the love of God that's in Jesus Christ we're at rest Just Let The Old Ship toss any way she wants to The Anchor Holds brother REM said I come by on Harbor one time and I seen that we were flying in a plane and you know is when you're in a plane sometimes you can look down and he says coming down low there was a big old ship there and the sails had been let down you know and oh what a storm on the sea she was tossing and I seen that Old Ship there rocking back and forth and some waves that that would go in and some ways that would go under and everything and I said I wonder why that is and a fellow a fellow setting said it's got a sea anchor on it therefore the ship can't sink it can go through the waves but it can't sink because it's anchored he said I said oh praise be to God we got an anchor some waves we can go over some we can go under but regardless if the anchor holds so every wave we're not going to go over some we go under but it doesn't matter the anchor holds it isn't the ship doing the holding it's the anchor doing the holding it isn't what I am or what I will be or what I was it's what he is now and what he did for me and you it ain't what I can do it's what he has done now he's getting into this he'll go right into this of Faith itself my faith doesn't anchor in what the coming meetings will be my faith doesn't rest in any ability that I would have or upon what church I should join or what people I should associate with now many scriptures that we could just allude to here and I in many ways I'm just resting on the Holy Spirit to bring them to your attention and this is where that Paul could say in the opening of First Corinthians though I could have a lot of things gifts and everything else but if I do not have the love of God now God's love is not a peachy Philly powder sugary type thing God's love is a love that is based on his word is that right it's a it's a love that comes to minister and to deal with and to address and to meet and to overtake and to transform situations that's what the love of God does you say how do you know that because that's what he did for me is that what he did for you that's what the love of God is so when we see this you notice it doesn't rest upon anything it doesn't rest up on any uh associate or what any gift or anything but my faith anchors and rests entirely upon the finished work of the Lord Jesus Christ already been received God Justified him by raising him from the dead this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased and God raised him from the dead for our justification the Christian rest in that hope upon the stormy seas sure storms rise all kinds of troubles but were anchored that's all it'll never sink it can't sink remove the anchor and the ship is tossed about remove the anchor and the ship can sink but if the ship the anchor is set it doesn't matter if though it's on the wave under a wave doesn't matter the storms or it's calm the anchor is what holds constant and it's the anchor as Paul said that entereth within the veil Brethren said I've noticed now he draws from this he says I've noticed many Christians in my life to be up and down and I've wondered about that he said you find people who seem to be very religious seem to have such a deep desire and daily they search and hunt and seek for God and never come to any settlement of any kind to where they could ever be settled or Anchored In Christ what's he talking about being established and this I have learned to be an experience that is people of intellectuals he said now speaking of this there's two different types of Christianity he said seems strange and he can just follow me here he says I I don't want to say two different types but I want to say two different phases would be a better word to use not two types two phases the same Christianity but two phases of it and one of them is an intellectual or a mental conception of what God has said in his word and of Jesus Christ by the way of knowledge and the other is an ex experimental experience that God has given the man in his heart so intellects and then an experience that God gives a man in his heart the one intellectually is hungering he's feasting on God but his Feast doesn't hold out what's further I'm talking about when they would go to gather the manna right every morning they had together the manna and the Manna was coming down from heaven but that Manna they have were to eat of that Manna and then whatever they didn't eat that day than they were to burn that is that right that manner though if they kept it then it would canker and get worms in it is that right but the manna that fell on the very first day the first time the Mana ever fell when Aaron was instructed to go get a golden Homer of that Manna and take it into the holiest of holies that Manna never corrupted or conquered what is the manner a type of the Holy Ghost and you can look and say well the Holy Ghost that's God how could that ever conquer it matters where it's at if it's only on the flesh it'll go away if it's only in the spirit realm the mind the intellects it'll go away but if it's there in the soul in that predestinated Omer golden Homer of almighty God there is a keeping power of the Holy Spirit a seal of the Living God an anchor an experience an establishment that no matter what's going on your experience is the same today as it was yesterday your experience is the same tomorrow as it was a year ago what is it because it's an experience of the Holy Ghost in the depth of the Soul let me just say this to you many times people can have experiences and it has not reached the depth of their soul yet don't throw those experiences away those EXP [Applause] hears about you and he wants to do for you see I want scripture on that Jacob when he left to go to uh the land of of Rebecca's Kindred and to go there he meets God in Bethel the first time but he's not changed but God lets him know I'm the god that's your daddy talked about and the god that's your father Abraham talked about I am God what you've heard about what you know about I'm letting you know I'm that God that they talked about that presence that you sensed when Jacob when your father would or or Abraham or Isaac would talk about I want you to know that's who I am I am that God and I'm mindful of you and I'll bring you back to this place and Jacob came back to that place years later right 14 years later and he met God face to face and he wrestled it out right it went then into the depths of experience an establishment in his life did Jacob after that moment did was was Jacob the same no Jacob was changed is that right was Jacob then a perfect man as far as in all of his doings no I don't have time in the scripture to go through that but there's one thing that was for sure he had met God and he was established in the word of God and When Storms would tried to come and at different times you'll see where Jacob the Bible say in Jacob then another times it'll say Israel what is it it's the Israel is the part on the inside that has been redeemed by the strong one that's why there's got to be a establishment in our life that then brings all things subject to himself it's established so he says the other one seems to have Victory all the time there's nothing bothers them these memories just we just ready talked about the intellectual and then he talks about this one he says the woman experience had seems to have Victory all the time there's nothing bothers them they're just as solid and anchored as they can be no trials no storms bother them at all but they seem to have something about them that people who are Christians and trying to live for God admire that type of Christian and I've often wondered Lord what is it that these people have that others crave so much for and yet seen to fail to get it and I know that's a great Christian of all uh questions sorry of all of our hearts who have served Christ and I've never seen a person yet that ever once comes to him excepting afterwards they their life never seemed right to them anymore if they ever left Christ I just want to say that within this God has a provided way and I think of the scripture in the book of Jeremiah when here Israel is preparing to go into bondage and Jeremiah under the unction of the Holy Spirit God is is speaking to Israel of what they should ask for and when he's telling them ask for the old I don't have that up there I'm just referencing that as it's coming to me ask for the Old Paths ask for the paths to be restored what paths are we talking about we're not talking about dirt paths we're talking about the path of righteousness the path of Holiness the path that we're and has become obscure ask for those Old Paths let me just say this to you and I that this is something that God in his grace God made a promise to himself because he was not him saying to David you shall discover but he says David by inspiration said thou Wilt show me the path of life so it shows that the Old Paths are revealed by the person of almighty God thou Wilt show me the path of life so the Old Paths God knew even though in our heart there could be a craving there could be a longing and trying to find this and not getting settled here and trying to find this and not getting settled here there's only one place of settlement for a real believer and I'm talking about even as you wondered throughout the world you might have wondered through church through church from denomination to denomination but if you are ordained to be in the land of promise there is no satisfaction outside of the word of God because it's not a man that is calling you it's not a man that put that desire in you Sunday school thank God for it it didn't put it in you thank God for daddies and mommies and devotion but they didn't put it in you God put that desire in you and God knew you would be here in this hour can I just say what the prophet said he said God knew you would want the Holy Ghost how did he know that because you always were one of his Hallelujah glory be to God he knew it and he made a way that you would be able to receive it God's provided way it's God working it was God hearing through his word there was a call coming out of our life restore the Old Paths oh God Hallelujah and so when we see this to be established I want to go in the scriptures that we could to Colossians chapter 1. and look here for a few moments in verse 21. and I want you to watch this purpose and this objective that God has for our lives it's something that it moves it moves and has moved from the mind of God it is pulsated from the heart of God it came down that it it brought forth our lovely Lord Jesus Christ who paid the price in Redemption and it now pulsates through a body of believers and you verse 21 that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by Wicked Works yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblameable and unreprovable in his sight this is his working you can look at your life and say you don't know what I have in my life let me just tell you he ain't looking at you when he's dealing with you because if he's looking at you and he took into account all of our sin or every attribute and all unbelief he'd never deal with this but he's looking at a perfect sacrifice and that's why the word can come with such Authority beloved now we are the sons of God you don't all of a sudden come to a place and then he starts talking to you like a son or daughter of God he is bringing a word that is calling you and I to sonship to adoption as Sons and Daughters of God he's not all of us he's not calling you a pig and then turning around and calling you a sheep he's letting you know don't allow that nature of a pig to rule over you you're a sheep you ordained to be a sheep Let the word of God have the right away your doubt throw them down don't try to change it throw it down in his presence Hallelujah glory be to God I tell you friends that's why with the Gospel of Jesus Christ we can stand because it's the power of God unto salvation it is power to undo holds it has power to dismantle every form of Darkness it has power to overthrow all unbelief it has power to consume every attribute of sin glory be to God a few now this is verse 23 let's move into this moment if you continue this is very important in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the Gospel so there's a continuance just like when God takes a hold of a life justification they repent of their sins still the thing on the inside that brought forth all the habits still there right then you walk on with the word you begin to apply the blood how do I apply the blood you apply the word you apply it to your life there's things that you can see in your life and the Holy Spirit will call it out and identify those things sometimes we'll call it straight out other times it's just right there to you personally without even anything being said what do I do at that moment you take a hold of the word apply it to your life and say Lord I lay it down under for the glory of God now Lord clean it out of My Heart Lord what is that continuing continuing amen being in prayer with that listen this is a journey and a walk between you and God I know I'm speaking to all across the board but we're interested in one thing establishment and how the word even for lives that have crossed and are dwelling in the promised land that we continue to be established and grow it still takes the applying of the word right that's why brother Graham said you don't take the token it's the medicine and put the medicine on the Shelf you take the medicine and take it is that right glory be to God now if you continue in the faith grounded and settled so everything that God is doing every work of God that he does in your life is to further establish you for another move David said he's making my feet like Heinz feet God establishes my Goings God does that that's God revealing and speaking very personally to our lives now and be not moved away from the hope of the Gospel which you've heard which was preached to every creature which is under Heaven whereof Paul I am made a minister uh it goes on to say here who now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake which is the church whereof I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of God and then it goes in this is this is the Fulfillment of the word of God that we're called to even the mystery that have been hid from ages and generations but now it's made manifest to his Saints to whom God would make known what is the richest of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory so the Fulfillment that we are called to ordained to is that let Christ be the Fulfillment in our life that he would fill every fiber of our life but Christ would so dwell in our hearts there would be an assurance of the expectation of Glory that would look Beyond just this realm and be able to see that when it's all said and done I know in whom I have believed and I am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day who we will preach and I notice as he moves into this warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus and I I think of that as we were referencing there to that quote and even where Jeremiah restored to us the Old Paths that God is God's desire is that our lives would be established it would be settled we'll be grounded remember the Bible says walk in the light as he's in the light it didn't say skip in the light jump in the light running the light it said walk because when you walk it's one foot in front of another and what's God doing as you walk you come to that place and you're solid right there what did I do be solid in what God has revealed thus far what God has made known be established in that right now and say Lord as more that he will reveal to you and I because God can't reveal anything further unless we first walk in obedience to what he's already revealed is that right so here God opening his way now then we may present every man perfect that's a completion in Christ Jesus that's that's a perfect word of the new birth where unto I also labor striving according to his working which worketh in me mightily so Paul what's motivating you is it to have a big congregation no is it money no what's moving what's propelling you on what God had in his mind what was in his heart is pressed right there and the desire is is to see Christ enthroned in the heart of God's children where lives are established that no matter what comes or goes that life is established in Jesus Christ the life is not fixed on anything else it's established in Jesus Christ no matter if this one goes or that one leaves her mama leaves or daddy leaves my heart is fixed in God I have met him face to face established in him amen and that's a revelation that's not our intellect because if intellectually this makes sense there'll be something else come wrong that will intellectually seem to make better sense but remember every every every word that comes to you is a word that's coming not for your reasoning it's coming for your soul I want to walk under that word that brings Liberty a word of redemption a word of authority not a word that makes allowances not a word that makes excuses because that's not the word of God that's the word of man is that right so now to think of this here there is a fountain oh uh a fountain another man with references here and I just want to paraphrase it there's a fountain that's open in the House of David there's a fountain that's open in in the revealed word The Word of Promise in this hour a fountain that can take care of all cleanliness all all in Purity it'll take care of everything what will do that the blood of Jesus Christ amen you can go in one way when commens will go in Sinners you'll come out saved you'll go in sick you'll come out well going downtrodden come out disheartened weary tossed about by every little thing and you'll come out on the other side established that's the power of the blood of Jesus Christ that's the power of the holy ghost moving through amen the revealed word in this hour now notice what Paul would say in Romans 16 25. now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ according to the revelation of the mystery which was Kept Secret since the world began I want you to notice Paul here he is even asserting and then I think it's the chapter before this and he speaks of how that of the ministering of the word that has been committed to him to the Gentiles that the offering up might be acceptable unto God Sanctified by the Holy Ghost let me just say this there is no other gospel than the Gospel of Jesus Christ and that gospel was committed to Paul so any other thing that is to pattern or line up must match that pattern that was given it was a pattern that points back to the Fulfillment from before the foundation of the world and that word has never diminished that word cannot be changed men have tried to change it let me just tell you something if man would just be honest and say I don't have the power to live it but I need to meet God who gave this word instead of making excuses for why I can't live it why I can't walk in Victory I believe God will come down I don't want to believe it I know God will come down and make his word known [Music] oh my I say God let all the pretending and everything else and act in phariseeism and everything else be put aside God just once Honest Hearts that'll stand right there and call him on the scene and if you can't you never reach that place yet just be honest with God and say God send the power just now Lord [Applause] oh my to him Paul might have been the vessel but it's him the Lord Jesus that has power to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ according to the revelation of the mystery which was Kept Secret since the world began aren't you glad it's no longer a secret see when things are secret you could guess at it you could probe at it but when the secret is revealed the silence is broken right there's no more guessing it's now in plain view so when that which is in plain view then you can have a certainty upon your approach and to know that what God has said and he sounded that to my heart I can act upon that word by the authority of the voice that is speaking to me but now verse 26 let me get here but now it's made manifest and by the scriptures of the prophets according to the Commandment of the Everlasting God made known to All Nations for The Obedience of Faith to God only wise be glory through Jesus Christ forever now I don't I don't have this but I want to refer to it remember when Paul came to thee Philippian Jailer pardon me and remember the Philippine General the walls you know we were shaking down the Philippian Jailer asked Paul there was something about it God knew there was a predestinated seed down there true what knew that that's why that's why even Paul I can't go into all that the predestinated oil or orchestration of God but here's the Philippian Jailer he comes out of there and he asked them the question what must I do to be saved what must I do you see the scripture said all all the father has given me will come to me the scripture I read here in the beginning and Matthew come unto me oh you better have relating and I'll give you rest what's he saying come unto me get to him right Revenge said it's like offering coconuts on a tree and we built the fence so high you got to do this quit doing this quit doing this quit doing this we believe in Holiness we believe in approaching the things of God because sometimes a life can't understand why am I not getting anywhere because if you're not repentive in your heart you can't get anywhere with God but when the Holy Spirit strikes your heart come unto me all you that are heavy laden let go and let the holy spirit that is drawing you let me tell you has your leg go in that moment you'll find out that every hold of unbelief will let go of your life why because the power of the Lord is present to bring healing in your life not what must I stop doing what just believe it's like trying to take all the leaves off the tree that's just you but get down to the root of it say God deal with the root of it Lord come to him get to him move to him amen and he'll take care of that work and that's why brother random says Paul told him believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved he said get the faith of God back in the people so they'll know what to do and how to act Faith brings you back to a place do you know what to do and how to act sure I believe listen John laid the standard in his word there's Holiness is Holiness was not a Bible doctrine that brother Branham came up with Holiness has always been in the word is that right it's been restored in this hour this is an hour of restoration it's an hour of divine Separation by the Holy Spirit dwelling in vessels that he has chosen or ordained and assembled to himself it has always been and he does have to remind us there is things that's called out but I believe as a person gets close to God and they're looking to God it will affect your wardrobe it'll affect your attitude it'll affect your outlook on life why because it is the power of God unto salvation it changes a person's life what is it it's getting close to the faith of God and it'll influence how to act Hallelujah that's the face that's that that's the face that I want my book in or the book I want my face in I'll get it right there sometime right I don't want to be checking out what the current styles are and what this and I Lord I want my life to match your word I don't want to match the world I don't want to match the world I want to match the word of God is that right so the objective of faith is a settledness is to be at rest is to be at rest and that don't mean snoozing it means to be at rest in other words I'm settled there's nothing between I and my savior it's settled it's settled and you know that's God's desire it's not it listen that's not your desire it's God's desire because you are ordained to be a son and daughter of God and God Wants You operating with an authority and that comes by is being established that's why Brethren could make this this statement I'm just going to refer to a few places Faith itself he said doesn't come by fasting Faith doesn't come by praying or reading a book all of that's good but faith comes by a settled something in the human heart see it's a settled faith is a settled something it's not something that's worked up but it's settled I want you to think of this in the just for a moment as we read Psalms 119 verse 89. in Psalms 118 Verse 89. I got to looking this up on the med and today or I don't know if I'm saying it right but I'm not going to go into all that but I just got to just sometimes you're drawn to certain things I think I'm going to look this up here and I just feel impressed to do so but uh you know we all have well I don't want to say we all you know you have watches you have we have calendars we have things to keep time and you know when it comes to turning back our clocks or moving them forward and this isn't scriptural but this is just my thoughts my opinion I wish they just stopped that stuff and let's just let's just stay the same but I'm glad that we have our cell phones or just they go ahead and kick forward or they kick back and you know you don't have to go I mean you still have to go around the house and send all the rest of the clocks right now but uh you know there's something that with the word of God no matter what else goes on it remains constant it's always right on time right God has said it the Bible said that the heavens declare his handiwork right God's first Bible was wrote in the heavens when God spoke to job remember he refers him to even the constellations even to him who has the Seven Stars in his hand speaks in those manners and so here in Psalms 119 verse 89 I want you to see this forever O Lord Thy word is settled in heaven I love that it was already before he ever spoke it it was already settled in the mind of God it was already settled right the lamb Revelations 13 8 the lamb that was slain in the mind of God before the foundation of the world Ephesians 1 he had chosen Us in him when before the foundation of the world why we were in him we were part of this genus we were a part of him write his word has always been settled in heaven so God's not here on Earth like an author of a book in this time that has to submit his work and they edit it send it back or they reject it and then you have to send it back and edit it and send it back and take this person out no no God's word is settled and God has not asked anybody to edit his work man have tried to edit it but when you added it you're taking out part of God oh Hallelujah forever oh Lord Thy word is settled in heaven so if it was settled in heaven how could it not be settled in Earth that will be done in Earth even as it is in heaven Lord lead me to that same settledness that when you spoke it what are you asking Lord thy faith come Lord the same faith that said let there be and stood back and believed his own word let it be in this earth Lord forever O Lord Thy word is settled in heaven thy faithfulness is unto all generations thou Hast establish the Earth and it abideth there's been a lot of changing kingdoms a lot of changing influences but the Earth Still Remains the Same go away right even the stars and the moons and they can do all these predictions but you'll never find a timepiece like it right there's nobody out there you know standing out here on the lake and saying okay Tides go back right then nobody says Hey Tides come in nobody God has it already set up do you see God everything is set for our life and our walk with him the coming the growing the rising the following the everything is all set by almighty God God has already provided for you and I you and I were always a part of him and we come here in this time he has prepared a place for me and we have been this word has been ordained and prepared In This Moment Christ being revealed it is a place that has been prepared just as much as God knows there's some that like mountains some that like planes some men like water and some that don't God knew you would love this word god knew you would be identified with this word god knew you would press through all disappointments through all frustrations why because you're part of him [Applause] he knows you my goodness glory to God thou Hast established the Earth and it abideth they continue this day according to thine art ordinances for all are thy servants brother Brown comes in here and questions and answers 59. he says now death means separated and some of death in the body okay so my death death means separated now physically we separate from our physical sight because that's still sin right we bury our loved ones because the body itself is still sin still get sick is that right even even our spirit not our soul but our human Spirit right there'll be there's got to be a fading away of that God's already made a way you're always made to be a three-room house right so when the soul itself has as that Soul as it moves it moves right into that theophany that word body that's been right there by you the whole time is that right it's not traveling far out here it's just a step come on brother Brandon tells us he says right here in this building he said oh God let the glorified body that's standing beside them give them a charge this morning and this is why you are no longer foreigners and strangers not only to the Covenant but you now have you are and your representation Before the Throne of God and here you are you theophany is one that was some way far away out there is right here glory and then then that the orphany with the soul and that theophany then will come forth a glorified body a human body in a glorified condition not made of that between a man and woman but it will be that which will be by the word of God will we look the same we will look according to what we were between 18 and 25. come on God already had his family album set before the foundation of the world it's not like you and I finding out about our children and watching them grow God already took a picture of you when you were in your Perfection and that's why this word is calling you to that same Perfection he's not looking at what you are he's looking at his word he's looking at his word and he's speaking the blessings over your life what's happening with that come up hither come up come up because the whole Declaration of Revelations 4 come up Heather it's become the dwelling place Four and Twenty Elders becoming a tabernacle of the Living God it's a body on display surrounded by the Covenant of almighty God Hallelujah blessed be his name death means separated now physically we separate from our physical sight but that's still sin but our spirit is of God that can never be separated from God because we're a part of God we are brought back into that thought of God everything that God does is perfect and eternal and when God's very thoughts went out for a kingdom of people who would worship Him them very thoughts is eternal they can no more perish every word of God is eternal Jesus said Heaven's on Earth will pass away both heavens and earth may pass away but my words will never pass away they're Eternal with God and if you abide in me in my word abide in you we become a part of his word part of his life for we are flesh of his flesh bone of his bone and life of his life then we can no more perish than God himself could perish that's what the Holy Ghost is brother Brian talks about a little fella by the name right the same same quote of from Georgia brother Welch Evans you hear brother Brandon talk about brother Welch Evans quite a bit and this is just one of the places where the holy spirit will deal with these things in the settling Hearts establishing lives I want you to notice here he says a little fella from Georgia brother Evans he's been everywhere across the country he's a great supporter of my good friend oral Robertson he supported all his television cast down in there and a lot of things he did but he said to me the other day he said brother Branham I went over to brother Jagger's school I went everywhere I stayed there for three months I was hunting I went to the places each one of them and bring it back to the same thing I could never get a place where I had any Assurance if I do this or if I do that and what I might do here or am I or am I not see what it is is unsettled he said I went he went went to there to brother World he's looking for something to help him become established because you can't do anything unless you're you're settled right and so let me just say it's Satan's desire to keep you in an unsettled condition it's Satan's desire to even you know and some of the ways that he could even try to do that is where a person can you know they they can feel a release from the Forgiveness of their sins but they don't go on to the full baptism of the Holy Ghost and it becomes unsettled what am I doing what did I do and did I and it becomes unsettled but you see God's desire is to settle you let me just say this you're not ever going to get settled by going away from his voice right you have never get settled you can only be settled by the word of God and if you if your heart is open to the word of God God establishes his children is that right notice this he went all sorts of places trying to get Assurance he says and I I didn't have any says till I heard your teachings said then that settled it once for all and this is the scripture that the Holy Spirit was so impressing for the worshiper wants purged from his sins has no more conscience that means no more desire of sin he's passed from Death unto life and he's got eternal life inside of him dwelling there and can no more die than God can die exactly the Bible he's eternally taken care of because he's got eternal life why the inside man there's been a purging on the inside the old desire the old nature it's gone right it's not looking you can go to you're going to Oral Roberts remember brother random takes the same account in word made flesh India trip and a man has gone here and they tell him you got to speak in tongues speaks in tongues he says still and then they tell him you got to shout he shouts they go over here and tell him this tell him that and they're telling all sorts of things and they told him you know there's such a mess in your life I'm paraphrasing that you need to see a prophet you need to go talk to brother random and brother Brown stands right up there and says brother you don't need a prophet you just need to get straightened out and he took him back in his life and he says at one time in your life you used to love all those things of dancing and drinking and all the immorality and you know everything we're doing clothing and everything else he said but what happened to your life he said what happened what what took place in your life and the man began to rehearse when he was reading just a track and he said I seen what was in my wife's life he said but as I was reading this track somebody gave me a track and when I pulled it out it said where will you spend eternity now we know that the hell is not Eternal but it still was the thought on there and as he began to read that he said something rolls up in my heart even at that moment and repentance and all was made and he said there was something that came over me and brother Brandon said so from that moment he said all the rest of those things were gone he said yes he said brother you've had it the whole time and the man jumped off the porch and he said my I've had it the whole time what established him the word faith is not an emotion it's not a workup faith is a settled something that is in the heart declaring and knowing whom I have believed I have passed from death unto life I'm established in Jesus Christ by his power I just invite you this morning if you haven't met that God in that way let him invite him to establish don't don't be too proud don't have too much of a put on out front but invite him to establish you in that way and if there's things that in your life that you can look and say at one time my life was this way I could look this way and and you know don't look at all your mistakes you're always going to have mistakes now Disobedience to the word of God that's a different story we got to get down to the heart but I'm talking about mistakes that are made I'm talking about failures that's what the blood of Jesus Christ takes care of God's looking on your heart that's where from your heart it's to have that place to where that you know I've passed from Death unto life that God established that let God settle that to where your faith is settled in the word of God it's not an emotion I believe in emotions I believe in that right I believe in that I believe I I believe in all of that I give you many different quotes on it but but it's not faith is not based on that faith is based on a settledness in our heart that I know in whom I have believed that when everything is said and done the music is over the prayer benediction has been offered you leave out of here with a victory in your life the victory is not contingent upon the organ the piano or anything the victory is within you [Music] amen God bless you let's bow our heads hallelujahs our heads are bound amen and amen I wonder if there'd be a heart here this morning and say Lord be it unto me Lord let it be established Lord in my heart let my heart be established in you God bless you bless you let it be established in you Lord God bless you amen you know the Bible said let all of our doings our goings be established in him God's desire is for you and me to operate in a settledness in our life to where our lives are settled it's not dependent upon anybody else our walk is not dependent upon anyone else but it's centered in Jesus Christ it's an anchor if that's not been your case in your life if it's been up if it's been down in and out and in the world back out of the world let him establish you this morning but I I just say it to you like this invite him to your heart don't don't just do it because it's the right thing to do do it because he's speaking to you and say Lord from my heart from My Heart Lord establish me amen God bless you oh my let's just offer a word of prayer here Heavenly Father Lord as we bow our our heads Lord our hearts and your presence that's what your desire is Lord always been the objective is that we would come to a settled faith established Lord and then for every every single part of our life it's at rest ing in the finished work of calvary Lord I pray this morning I pray if there's one that's here Lord that hasn't come to that place yet may they walk under the anointing of the Holy Spirit Lord may they make their way out of their Pew may they make their way out of their circumstance by the grace of almighty God and Lord I'm not going to let anything Pride stand in my way I want to be established I want to be settled I don't want to put nothing on I don't want to act I want an establishment Lord God I pray right here this morning is your presence Lord Has Come Lord You're The God Who establishes just like you did with brother Welch Evans or in his mind Lord he was looking and he went to Oral Roberts he went to many different ones he was wondering he was looking Lord it was just like sister Bruce in her interview with the prophet oh God establishing it Lord upon Christ I pray that father grant that this morning [Music] Lord there's only one place for us to look and that's to you it's not to Lord any feeling any emotion it's to you to you granted Lord I pray here this morning Lord may that be the settledness Lord in every every heart here

your presence Lord in the name of Jesus Christ oh my what an opportunity [Music] a time to walk under the anointing you know that same anointing from the holiest of holies he's here this morning that same Pillar of Fire that divided himself on the day of Pentecost he's here this morning you remember before he came Peter walked with him Peter knew him but Peter under pressure ran from him but Jesus said when you're converted then strengthen your brethren then work to establish others what by the same power that you'll be established by that same anointing is here the same anointing of the Holy Spirit he said what must I do maybe you need healing in your body this morning maybe you need Deliverance remember there's a doctor's report and you need a settledness within that perhaps there's a settleness you need in your soul the anointing of the Holy Spirit is here by his word what do I have to do taking at his word don't wrestle with your circumstances you can't change them God is a God who takes situations that are void dark and Bleak and transforms them by his word don't wrestle with it just lay it down lay it down and just take the word and walk under the anointing of almighty God Walk under the anointing and the same anointing that brought forth a rod that that could not burying almonds or fruits or anything in the presence of the anointing of God you but it blossomed and brought forth fruit that's the presence of God that's the anointing of God it's not hard it's just from your heart just walk into it it matters we man just worship him if you'd like prayer this morning we'd be glad to pray with you [Music] God is mindful friends we want to move by the anointing of God is here when God has spoken to us we want to take that opportunity if you let fear hold you back it'll build greater the next time the wall becomes higher but it's a time right now to poke it to poke it I'm not going to be held back God is calling me it's not I'm worthy to walk in there but the worthy one has said come walk with me he's calling to me and I'm going to obey him I'm gonna I'm gonna take him out his word because he's not a man that he should lie or the son of man that he should repent Hallelujah glad lead us brother Brian [Music] yes Lord [Music] about holy Jesus Jesus name amen all Christ the son oh my let's worship Him [Music] he is sinking sand oh brother [Music]
