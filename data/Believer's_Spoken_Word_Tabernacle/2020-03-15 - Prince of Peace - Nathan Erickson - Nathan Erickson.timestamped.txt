[36:46] we just want to just so thankful for the
[36:50] mercy of God this morning so glad to be
[36:53] able to be here and I was glad I want to
[36:57] say I appreciate it brother Jerry
[36:59] ministering for us on Thursday night
[37:01] amen is such a wonderful word that the
[37:04] Lord delivered to our hearts and we just
[37:08] so appreciate him and sister Mina and
[37:10] being here with us and knowing that the
[37:13] circumstances and we want to continue
[37:16] just pray for them as they go back home
[37:18] tonight and we want to remember continue
[37:23] remember brother bill and the family in
[37:25] prayer and also for all the Sanchez
[37:28] family the losses has just been through
[37:32] you know and I think every I think as a
[37:35] church there's a lot that with that
[37:37] right there we had been through I just
[37:39] met with them just met with someone
[37:41] Friday and I said you know I kind of
[37:43] looked forward to this little time on
[37:45] Friday to meet I said with you all I
[37:48] said because this is the first meeting
[37:50] I've had this not dealt with death and
[37:53] dying it's been a solid month it's been
[37:56] a solid month and I just thank God for
[38:00] His grace that house that he has he has
[38:02] strengthened us and he'll continue to
[38:04] strengthen us each and every each and
[38:06] every one and that's where as a body we
[38:08] feel for one another we pray for one
[38:11] another and you know the reality of it
[38:14] is is that whether or not somebody goes
[38:16] to church here or not
[38:18] I don't know how many times even when I
[38:19] was still teaching school different ones
[38:21] would lose somebody my heart still goes
[38:23] out to them and I still pray for them
[38:25] and still pray for my because prayers
[38:28] itself I don't find that scripturally
[38:30] that prayers just stay if if I think
[38:32] they're a member of the bride of Jesus
[38:34] Christ or if they are go to this
[38:35] assembly with that they see that's what
[38:38] the real Spirit of God of this message
[38:40] come to do it come to deliver us from
[38:41] that organizational thinking amen
[38:45] to where even Paul as I mentioned to you
[38:48] the other night Paul would take and
[38:49] write in Timothy and say let us remember
[38:51] to pray for the Kings rulers and
[38:53] different ones who are in charge that we
[38:55] may live peaceably that scripture still
[38:58] applies because we're not praying to
[39:00] turn America around we're not praying
[39:02] for that so that scripture still has to
[39:05] be in effect Jesus Christ the same
[39:07] yesterday today and forever and we pray
[39:09] as long as we have to be here we pray
[39:11] that God would give them wisdom
[39:13] and you know some of the things right
[39:15] now we we don't know you know we see a
[39:18] lot of it around us where people is fear
[39:22] people are living in fear and I and I
[39:25] really believe it's it's it's something
[39:27] it's a condition it's almost like a
[39:29] litmus test where you see just a little
[39:31] something right now and it just sends
[39:33] the people off and everybody starts
[39:35] scrambling and you know if we understand
[39:38] the things that just common sense wise
[39:40] if you just go to the store buy what you
[39:42] need for the week like you normally do
[39:45] about what you need for two weeks then
[39:47] you go to the store and you know I think
[39:49] God for His grace and you know it's not
[39:53] like the word ignorant of things but at
[39:55] the same time we're not to be occupied
[39:58] to where that it becomes everything
[40:00] about our conversation you know I love
[40:03] your brother Josh way but if every time
[40:05] I talked with you and you talked about
[40:07] coronavirus I think you wouldn't be
[40:09] seeing me too much just gonna be honest
[40:12] with you I mean it's the truth I mean I
[40:14] don't want to add to me that's not
[40:16] fellowship I don't want to talk you know
[40:18] we there's times I'd keep up with it
[40:20] read it try to do what little things I
[40:22] can do here and there but it's not gonna
[40:23] I don't want that to occupy my life and
[40:26] it's wonderful I think how the Lord has
[40:28] spoke to us we find it over and over in
[40:30] his word we have peace and thank God for
[40:33] the peace that we have amen and you know
[40:37] the thing of it is and you know brother
[40:38] Scott you'd know this and being a doctor
[40:40] and things they've made it very clear
[40:42] abran P individuals have come out and
[40:44] said more people die from the flu 16,000
[40:48] deaths in a year and they said you're
[40:52] more likely to die from it they said if
[40:53] they would actually follow all of their
[40:55] announcements with make sure you get the
[40:57] flu shot but you know what there's a
[40:59] bigger epidemic than Korona more than
[41:02] the flu
[41:03] it's called sin and I'm glad there's an
[41:07] inoculation Mystere
[41:09] as affected this morning I'm glad about
[41:14] that aren't you
[41:15] hey man I'm so glad about that and in
[41:19] that inoculation we've got the promise
[41:21] then no plague shall come now that
[41:23] dwelling
[41:24] amen if it comes thank god we've got it
[41:28] we have a promise in the word of the
[41:30] Lord we want to I just want to announce
[41:33] to you we had put out that you know
[41:36] where we were going to have the
[41:38] fellowship and I'm just I'm making a
[41:40] decision and it's it's not because of
[41:41] coronavirus this was before all that I
[41:44] just made a decision I think as a church
[41:46] where the sisters everything of how
[41:49] they've labored and cooked and the
[41:51] resources we're just gonna cancel March
[41:53] and April's fellowship dinners and just
[41:55] save our energies and things for the
[41:57] time in May and so it had nothing to do
[42:01] with coronavirus because I still believe
[42:03] in praying over the food and sanctify
[42:05] everything sanctified through prayer let
[42:08] me tell you something probably some of
[42:09] the safest food you eat is that a carry
[42:11] and you don't know what some of that
[42:13] stuff is that the restaurants you go to
[42:16] hope brother Nathan preaches on faith
[42:18] now right but it's true so we we just
[42:22] you know we I want to just do that
[42:25] because and I want to say for the
[42:26] congregation I know that there had been
[42:29] the different ones that are even not
[42:31] here and money that was was given to
[42:34] towards the whatever's needed you know
[42:36] take care of it whatever is needed for
[42:38] food and different ones and your labor
[42:40] and and and cooking and the resources
[42:42] and just coming together as a body for
[42:45] both it was back to back I think within
[42:47] two weeks of one another and and I can
[42:50] tell you I was even at the one with them
[42:52] for for Liliana and I tell you it was it
[42:56] was a it was beautiful the spread that
[42:58] was there the food and how things were
[43:01] just done up and we want to say I thank
[43:02] you to sister Amanda and brother Aaron I
[43:05] appreciate all their labors a
[43:08] [Applause]
[43:14] sister Maya sister Amanda was right on
[43:17] it right away with sister when when
[43:19] Liliana had passed she was right on that
[43:21] and then also with sister Mary and so we
[43:24] just appreciate that them arraigned
[43:25] getting everything together the halls
[43:27] and things like that and just really
[43:30] appreciate that and as a body and so we
[43:35] March and April we won't have that and
[43:38] I've already instructed I instruct the
[43:40] song leaders every fall just don't have
[43:43] the people shake hands and it's simple
[43:44] it's just simple things you know over
[43:46] the flu and things like that you know
[43:47] and and and I told you on Thursday night
[43:50] and I don't mean this for a joke but if
[43:51] you haven't if you haven't been a
[43:53] regular hand washer start doing that
[43:57] godliness is next to cleanliness and I
[44:00] mean that I mean I don't mean that for a
[44:02] joke I can take you back into into
[44:04] chapters that are designated in the Book
[44:06] of Leviticus where God would not even
[44:08] allow the IFS of a vessel came in
[44:10] contact with something else it's unclean
[44:12] destroy it see God's not even though he
[44:15] said I'm the Lord that he loved thee but
[44:17] God didn't walk around and want us to be
[44:19] ignorant you say well that was all a
[44:20] type in a shadow but it still pertains
[44:24] it still pertains and we want to do what
[44:27] all that we can do that God has put into
[44:29] our our hands and even as we gather here
[44:32] I want to say thank you to brother
[44:34] Nathan and sister Cheyenne for being
[44:36] here sister Cheyenne thank you for
[44:38] letting him come all those times this is

[44:58] really appreciate them being here and
[45:00] coming and I'm just looking forward to
[45:02] the word of the Lord God knows what we
[45:05] have need of this morning amen so

[45:09] you and sister Cheyenne and you

[47:02] amen isn't that the truth this morning a
[47:05] man blessed to be the name of Lord God
[47:08] bless you it's so good to be with you
[47:09] again I always get so excited to come
[47:12] and be with the Saints here this this
[47:15] assembly really has a special place in
[47:17] my heart
[47:17] I just appreciate the warm welcome that
[47:19] we've always found here and we just
[47:23] appreciate and love you all in the Lord
[47:25] and how hard especially with the Sanchez
[47:27] family and this season of loss and we've
[47:30] been thinking and and praying for you so
[47:34] god bless you all
[47:36] let's go right to the word in mark
[47:39] chapter 4 and just want to thank for the
[47:41] Samuel for the invitation this morning
[47:43] the opportunity appreciate our brother
[47:49] Samuel
[47:52] we're gonna read a familiar story in the
[47:55] Bible here and mark the fourth chapter
[47:56] and I thought it was wonderful how the
[47:58] Lord even even even in the songs this
[48:03] morning inspired brother Brian with with
[48:06] the songs to just tie right into the
[48:09] inspiration it's on my heart this
[48:10] morning but I wanted it I want to spend
[48:12] a little time and I trust it won't keep
[48:14] you long this morning on this thought
[48:15] I've had on my heart on the Prince of
[48:17] Peace
[48:18] Prince of Peace amen amen and in this
[48:22] time in this season that we're living in
[48:23] this age there's one thing we have need
[48:26] of it's peace amen when when the world
[48:29] is falling apart
[48:30] people are tossed about and there's such
[48:33] a great pressure in this world amen but
[48:35] we have a source of peace this morning
[48:37] it's a mark 4 verse 35 and we find here
[48:44] that Jesus has been at the height of his
[48:46] ministry he's drawing the multitudes
[48:49] doing great miracles and and preaching
[48:54] great doctrines and mysteries and and
[48:57] and and here he's he's he's met with the
[49:00] multitudes and he's given parable after
[49:02] parable after parable but now he's come
[49:04] alone with his disciples and he's
[49:05] sharing things personally with them
[49:08] that's not for the public but just for
[49:10] his elect amen and now they're there
[49:12] they're taking a journey here Jesus and
[49:15] His disciples in verse 35 the same day
[49:18] when the evening was to come he saith
[49:20] unto them let us pass over unto the
[49:22] other side and when they had sent away
[49:24] the multitude they took him even as he
[49:26] was in the ship and there were also with
[49:28] him other little ships and there arose a
[49:31] great storm of wind and the waves beat
[49:33] into the ship so that it was now full
[49:35] and he was in the hinder part of the
[49:37] ship asleep on a pillow and they awake
[49:39] him and say unto Him master carest thou
[49:43] not that we perish amen anybody ever
[49:45] felt that way and he arose and rebuked
[49:48] the wind and saith unto the sea peace be
[49:51] still and the wind ceased and there was
[49:54] a great call and he said unto them why
[49:56] are you so fearful how is it that you
[49:58] have no faith and they feared
[50:00] exceedingly and said one to the other
[50:02] what man or a man is this that even the
[50:05] wind and the sea obey amen
[50:07] let's just pray give him glory this
[50:09] morning let's all pray together Heavenly
[50:12] Father we just thank you Lord for this
[50:13] time that you've set aside Lord - Lord
[50:16] to make this place available for us to
[50:18] gather together as Christians Lord in
[50:20] bonds of love father we're seeking
[50:23] refuge today from the storms of this
[50:25] life Lord Lord we know it's not in the
[50:27] world it's not in the systems Lord or
[50:29] the politics of this world the Lord
[50:31] pieces in you father pieces in our Lord
[50:33] Jesus Christ Lord and here you are
[50:35] present amongst us father you're not a
[50:37] far off Lord you've not forsaken us
[50:39] you've not left us alone but you're here
[50:42] in our midst Lord to bring us peace and
[50:43] I pray father that Lord hearts that are
[50:46] in turmoil and Lord those that have been
[50:48] suffering would be able to Lord have a
[50:50] moment Lord have a have an oasis a
[50:52] relief this morning Lord
[50:54] a moment in your presence Lord takes
[50:56] care of it all I just ask that you would
[50:58] be merciful to speak to us reveal your
[51:01] word to us Lord maybe in a greater way
[51:02] this morning father then we a greater
[51:05] understanding Lord along life's journey
[51:08] in Jesus Christ's name we dedicate
[51:10] ourselves to you
[51:10] amen amen god bless yous you're seated
[51:13] let's turn also to take our text here on
[51:16] the Prince of Peace to Isaiah chapter 9
[51:17] another very familiar scripture speaking
[51:20] of the coming of the Lord
[51:22] Isaiah 9 and verse 6
[51:29] amen
[51:40] and we find the prophecy here of our
[51:42] Lord in Isaiah 9:6 for unto us a child
[51:46] is born unto us a son is given and the
[51:50] government shall be upon his shoulder
[51:52] and his name shall be called wonderful
[51:55] counsellor the mighty God the
[51:57] everlasting father and the Prince of
[52:01] Peace of the increase of his government
[52:04] and peace there shall be no end upon the
[52:07] throne of David and upon his kingdom to
[52:09] order it and to establish it with
[52:11] judgment and with justice from
[52:12] henceforth even forever
[52:14] the zeal of the Lord of hosts will
[52:16] perform this amen
[52:19] the zeal of the Lord of hosts will
[52:20] perform this amen
[52:22] I think the Lord I just been studying on
[52:27] this Scripture you know and and and
[52:29] meditating on this this Prince of Peace
[52:30] and and one of my favorite one of my
[52:33] favorite types of studies in the
[52:35] scripture is to study on the names of
[52:37] God the names or the titles by which he
[52:40] calls himself and and maybe a year or
[52:43] two ago I had won on the Lord of Hosts
[52:44] that was so edifying to me but but you
[52:47] know these names of God there they're
[52:49] put in the scripture to reveal to us
[52:51] something about his character right he
[52:53] doesn't he gives himself these titles
[52:56] and all these things are all together in
[52:58] our Lord Jesus Christ but but he has
[53:00] these titles and he has these names by
[53:02] which he's called names like wonderful
[53:03] and counselor mighty God but but but
[53:06] he's called the Prince of Peace and it's
[53:08] revealing to us something about who he
[53:11] is and and his relationship to us as our
[53:14] Prince and our Prince that brings peace
[53:16] amen and so so so it's revealing an
[53:19] aspect of his character that he is the
[53:21] Prince of Peace now this scripture of
[53:23] the talking about a coming son to a
[53:26] child that's going to be born we know
[53:28] that speaking of the coming of the Lord
[53:29] unto us a child is born and that's a
[53:32] scripture that's been fulfilled we've
[53:33] had that he's calm he's been born into
[53:35] this world in a manger and and so if
[53:38] that part is fulfilled but then we find
[53:40] that there's more to this prophecy
[53:42] speaking of a son of David reign when
[53:45] he's going to take the throne of David
[53:47] and he's going to bring peace to the
[53:48] whole world
[53:49] amen and so there's the son of David
[53:51] ministry here in this same scripture
[53:53] amen but it's revealing these different
[53:56] aspects so it's an Advent promise which
[53:58] is a promise that's speaking of his
[54:00] coming so when he comes he's coming as
[54:02] the Prince of Peace a meant his presence
[54:05] his arrival his appearing amen is
[54:08] bringing peace so so so when we are
[54:11] looking for is coming when we're looking
[54:12] for his appearing looking for his
[54:14] presence amongst us then what we should
[54:16] find in our midst is peace amen a spirit
[54:19] of peace an atmosphere of peace and and
[54:21] so it's an Advent promise we find that
[54:25] same Advent promise echoed in
[54:26] Philippians chapter 4 and I'll just read
[54:28] it this morning that the Lord is at hand
[54:31] an Advent amen the Lord is at hand be
[54:34] careful for nothing but in everything by
[54:37] prayer and supplication with
[54:39] Thanksgiving let your requests be made
[54:42] known unto God and the peace of God
[54:44] which passeth all understanding Oh glory
[54:48] amen I just feel excited this morning
[54:50] the peace of God which passeth all
[54:52] understanding shall keep your hearts and
[54:55] minds through Christ Jesus amen
[54:58] hallelujah the Lord has see it's an
[54:59] Advent the Lord is at hand and he's
[55:01] coming with peace peace on earth and
[55:03] goodwill toward men
[55:05] amen not fear not worry not dread but
[55:07] peace and and joy amen but now but see
[55:11] the peace that he's coming he's coming
[55:12] and he's uttering in a great peace but
[55:14] it's a peace that passeth understanding
[55:16] amen and that's the wonderful thing
[55:18] about a Christian life is that we have
[55:21] access to a peace which is not really
[55:24] it's not in relation to our cares for he
[55:26] said for he said be careful for nothing
[55:29] don't worry about anything don't look at
[55:31] the circumstances the things that you're
[55:33] going through amen knowing that we go
[55:35] through trials and knowing we go through
[55:36] disappointments and heartaches and yet
[55:38] the peace that we have through the
[55:40] Prince of Peace is not it has nothing to
[55:43] do with our feelings or emotions or what
[55:46] we're going through but it's a knowledge
[55:48] that he is on the throne of our heart
[55:49] amen and all things are under his
[55:51] control
[55:52] amen it's a sovereign peace amen it's a
[55:55] rulership peace hallelujah oh it's a
[55:58] good news to the bride amen
[56:00] good news Advent a Shalom a good morning
[56:03] amen peace be with you the Sun's up amen
[56:06] we can see where we're going we can see
[56:09] clearly where we are and what we're and
[56:11] and then all these things all the
[56:12] sufferings of this present time are not
[56:14] worthy to be compared amen
[56:16] to the light that has been shed
[56:18] revealing the glory that is to be
[56:20] revealed in this pride amen it's a
[56:22] Shalom it's a peace that passes all
[56:24] understanding all all intellectual all
[56:27] reason all worry all doubt all emotion
[56:31] amen peace our peace is greater than all
[56:33] those things for it's not a peace that
[56:35] is a is in relation to our cares and our
[56:39] needs and whether our needs whether we
[56:41] feel like our needs are met or whether
[56:42] whether we feel like like like the world
[56:45] is secure our situation is secure it's
[56:47] not it has nothing to do with that this
[56:49] piece that we're preaching about we can
[56:51] have peace in spite of the circumstances
[56:53] in spite of the trials we can have peace
[56:56] in spite of all the conditions around us
[56:59] Christ is coming with peace his coming
[57:03] is with peace amen and and also it's a
[57:05] bit but you see this peace it's it
[57:07] passes all understanding do you see it
[57:09] his coming is not according to our print
[57:11] are our expectations when he comes when
[57:15] the God's doing a work it's never it's
[57:17] never according to our expectations
[57:19] brother Graham said in the world is
[57:20] falling apart
[57:21] they always turn God down because he
[57:23] doesn't come according to their taste to
[57:26] their taste didn't that's in that
[57:28] powerful that see when he comes it's not
[57:31] necessarily according to our taste the
[57:34] way that we think it ought to be the way
[57:35] the way that we think everything ought
[57:37] to end up though you know the outcome
[57:41] that we want amen is it's not always the
[57:43] way that the Lord does it is he said
[57:45] it's the same thing today it doesn't
[57:47] come in our theological taste but it
[57:49] comes in the way of the power of the
[57:52] demonstration of the manifestation of
[57:54] God's promise for the Aged amen
[57:56] beautiful quote amen but they refuse it
[58:00] they refused it then and they refused it
[58:02] today I'm just building to something
[58:04] here amen so bear with me they refuse it
[58:06] then they refuse it today because it
[58:08] doesn't meet the expectation of the
[58:10] according to the way that people expect
[58:13] it now now we understand that the
[58:15] message we understand that relation to
[58:16] the message that we're believing how God
[58:18] sent a prophet in the world rejected it
[58:20] but take that to our day to the bride of
[58:22] Jesus Christ amen believing that Christ
[58:25] is present in this bride and he's
[58:27] manifesting himself and revealing
[58:28] himself through this body these
[58:30] believers amen these sons and daughters
[58:32] of God showing a light to the world amen
[58:34] but what the world the world has missed
[58:36] it friends the world has rejected it
[58:39] they don't they have they don't accept
[58:41] it it's not according to their theology
[58:43] according to their tastes and that's the
[58:45] way that God works is never Amen never
[58:47] subject to our tastes and amen when that
[58:50] when this child that we read about when
[58:51] unto us a child is born when that child
[58:54] came it was a disappointment to a lot of
[58:56] people a man had brought a great
[58:58] disappointment to the way that God moved
[59:00] the way the God fulfilled his word was
[59:02] so a foreign to their taste because they
[59:04] were expecting a shining King to come
[59:06] and and we're in the temple veil and
[59:08] step out and announce himself to the
[59:09] high priests and put on shining armor
[59:12] and overthrow the Roman rule and all
[59:13] those sayings that and so there were a
[59:15] lot of disappointed people think about
[59:17] that now a lot of people disappointed
[59:19] yet it was a true fulfillment of the
[59:22] scripture the Pharisees were
[59:23] disappointed because he didn't endorse
[59:25] their religion amen he didn't care about
[59:27] their works and who their daddy was and
[59:29] where they came from what their position
[59:31] and and and their status and their
[59:33] dignity he had nothing he had no time
[59:34] for any of that amen and so it was a
[59:36] disappointment to them when Jesus came
[59:38] Judas was disappointed because Judas was
[59:41] a zealot and he was looking for
[59:43] something to happen in a political realm
[59:44] come on now he was he was expecting
[59:47] something to happen and God he thought
[59:49] God was going to work through politics
[59:50] and bring a great peace and it didn't
[59:52] happen France amen so what Judas he got
[59:55] disappointed because it wasn't according
[59:57] to his taste a rich young ruler was
[59:59] disappointed because he wasn't a dis
[1:00:01] respecter of persons Amen he didn't care
[1:00:03] about status didn't care about wealth he
[1:00:05] it wasn't he wasn't bringing those kinds
[1:00:07] of blessings and so and neither is the
[1:00:09] world satisfied with the advent of the
[1:00:11] bride amen because it's too humble it's
[1:00:15] too human
[1:00:16] amen for their taste and it might be
[1:00:18] even be to Pentecostal
[1:00:20] you see it when the breath see it's the
[1:00:22] same thing Christ and his bride amen it
[1:00:25] doesn't look like what we think it
[1:00:27] should look like it looks too weak it
[1:00:29] looks too human amen it looks too too
[1:00:32] too subject to the circumstances and the
[1:00:35] trials and the tribulations and even you
[1:00:37] and I it's not according to our taste
[1:00:39] some time because we're looking at our
[1:00:41] humility and our own humanity not
[1:00:44] recognizing God hides himself in such as
[1:00:47] that and is actually looking for a
[1:00:49] people that are so humble that the world
[1:00:52] will miss it and that's where he wants
[1:00:53] to hide his glory glory to God amen if
[1:00:57] you're home if you're weak this morning
[1:00:59] if you've got trials you've got
[1:01:00] struggles you're in the battle
[1:01:02] you're just where God wants you because
[1:01:04] that's where he reveals himself amen his
[1:01:07] strength is made perfect in weakness
[1:01:11] glory to God they're not the they'll
[1:01:14] never see the advent of the bride amen
[1:01:15] and that's why even people around this
[1:01:17] message have missed they have missed the
[1:01:20] awakening of the bride looking for a
[1:01:22] revival looking for something to come
[1:01:24] something off in the future some third
[1:01:26] pole that's going to come or some return
[1:01:28] of a prophet or something in the future
[1:01:30] but friends don't miss the awakening
[1:01:32] this morning hallelujah it's a shalom
[1:01:35] sunrise the rising of the Sun amen
[1:01:39] here and he's in his bride amen and we
[1:01:42] are in revival amen
[1:01:44] despite many times what our emotions are
[1:01:47] feeling and the things that we're going
[1:01:49] through and the burdens that we're
[1:01:51] carrying in this world yet we are what
[1:01:54] the word says we are hallelujah glory
[1:01:58] not even according to our taste looking
[1:02:01] at our trials and looking at the things
[1:02:03] that we endure but oh my it's not about
[1:02:06] you or I or the substance of these
[1:02:08] bodies or these human lives I I love
[1:02:11] this quote in Shalom brother Branham
[1:02:12] said talking about talking about
[1:02:14] creation he said Jesus could take he
[1:02:17] could take something that was created
[1:02:18] and he could multiply it Amen he took
[1:02:21] water he took some a creation of water
[1:02:24] and he turned it into wine amen he took
[1:02:27] her he took a little fish and he
[1:02:29] multiplied it he took a little he took a
[1:02:32] little bit of bread and and he
[1:02:33] multiplied it but look what he's done in
[1:02:35] this day I love how Bill Graham brings
[1:02:37] it out he said but in the last days when
[1:02:39] there's no sign of creation amen when
[1:02:43] there's no sign of creation he speaks it
[1:02:45] into creation anyhow what's he talking
[1:02:47] about
[1:02:48] he said he it shows he's the same God
[1:02:50] that was in the beginning he can create
[1:02:52] squirrels hey man he can create whatever
[1:02:55] he wants to because he's God hallelujah
[1:03:00] amen he's God so he can do what he wants
[1:03:03] to with creation if he can take nothing
[1:03:05] and turn it into a squirrel amen then
[1:03:08] you might be nothing and I might be
[1:03:10] nothing then he can take this creation
[1:03:12] and he can multiply it and multiply it
[1:03:16] Man Alive surrender to Jesus Christ amen
[1:03:19] the power of God will take that creation
[1:03:22] amen and make it multiplied of what it
[1:03:25] could ever be hallelujah he can bring
[1:03:27] out all the potential not your potential
[1:03:30] but all of his potential as a son or
[1:03:33] daughter of God it's all the potential
[1:03:34] the father is in this bride amen amen
[1:03:38] we got young people sitting here amen
[1:03:41] you don't know what you could be you
[1:03:43] don't you had you have no idea what God
[1:03:45] could do in your life amen
[1:03:47] surrender to God and watch him multiply
[1:03:49] and make things out of you you never
[1:03:51] thought were possible glory to God
[1:03:54] hallelujah because why because Brill
[1:03:58] Graham said he's God and he can do what
[1:04:00] he wants - amen he can create whatever
[1:04:03] he wants - because He is God so it's a
[1:04:06] sovereignty it's a sovereign creation he
[1:04:09] didn't solicit your opinion he didn't
[1:04:12] ask your idea he didn't ask what you
[1:04:14] thought about it he didn't hidden he
[1:04:16] didn't ever consulted you a what your
[1:04:18] opinion on what you thought you could be
[1:04:20] amen but he chose you
[1:04:23] amen he didn't consult you but he chose
[1:04:25] you and he predestinated you and the
[1:04:28] zeal of God shall perform in your life
[1:04:30] every word that a prophet spoke of a
[1:04:33] bride hallelujah all you got to do is
[1:04:36] believe it it's sovereign hey man Amen
[1:04:39] we're looking at these vessels that were
[1:04:40] living in and what are we but nothing
[1:04:42] but the the clay of this earth amen I
[1:04:45] was listening that message go awake
[1:04:46] Jesus and brother Brandon was dealing he
[1:04:48] was preaching that down in down in
[1:04:50] Louisiana he said what are you people he
[1:04:52] said you're nothing but Louisiana clay
[1:04:54] nothing but Louisiana clay or Texas clay
[1:04:57] all right or Ohio clay amen
[1:04:59] Amen nothing but the dirt of this way
[1:05:01] but what he said is but there's been a
[1:05:03] god of creation has taken this clay and
[1:05:07] built mud ships
[1:05:10] hallelujah friends amen you might be
[1:05:13] nothing but the dust of this earth but
[1:05:15] let God shape you let him have control
[1:05:17] of your life he'll make a mud ship out
[1:05:19] of you and you'll realize one day you're
[1:05:21] not the one at the helm Amen but he's
[1:05:24] the one steering the ship lorry to God
[1:05:26] and what are we we're actually vessels
[1:05:29] carrying about the body of Jesus Christ
[1:05:32] the Spirit of God the Prince of Peace
[1:05:35] amen everywhere that we go and just like
[1:05:38] these disciples not even cognizant of it
[1:05:40] many times a mud ship I just love that a
[1:05:44] mud ship amen amen
[1:05:47] or just a vessel just a vehicle for the
[1:05:49] Holy Ghost to take control and then he
[1:05:52] can steer it any way that he wants to
[1:05:53] and when we get a revelation Friends of
[1:05:55] who we are and what we have been called
[1:05:57] to be and who is the captain of the ship
[1:06:00] friends then it doesn't matter what
[1:06:01] waves we might steer through or what
[1:06:04] storms might come or great winds or
[1:06:06] trials or things that would assail us
[1:06:08] because he's in control and he's the
[1:06:11] master of every win the master of the
[1:06:15] sea glory to God amen
[1:06:18] multiplier you see so it's peace through
[1:06:23] preeminence what is he's that he's that
[1:06:25] he's the Prince of Peace now Prince
[1:06:30] speaks of rulership it speaks of
[1:06:32] authority see he's the captain of the
[1:06:34] vessel he's the one with the authority
[1:06:37] he's the one with the preeminence and
[1:06:39] it's peace through preeminence that's
[1:06:42] many times why we don't have peace
[1:06:43] because he's not the preeminent one not
[1:06:46] allowing him to be the sovereign one no
[1:06:48] no trust no faith no no no resting in
[1:06:52] him amen when we go through things in
[1:06:54] life's journey but in it but but that's
[1:06:57] the way that peace comes we look at this
[1:06:58] this story in the Bible of the Sea of
[1:07:00] Galilee how they came into this storm
[1:07:02] and I was just marveling about it here
[1:07:04] how here's Jesus Christ an actual advent
[1:07:07] of the Savior amen he's come in a human
[1:07:10] flesh
[1:07:10] he's come in a body
[1:07:12] and the world is so miss him his
[1:07:14] disciples have missed him not knowing
[1:07:15] who was in their midst
[1:07:16] amen and and and and it's such a mystery
[1:07:19] to them until when the waves came when
[1:07:21] the storm came even they begin to grow
[1:07:24] free they begin to they begin to
[1:07:26] question they begin to worry I say Lord
[1:07:28] do you even care
[1:07:29] amen and and and and I've been there
[1:07:31] friends in my Christian life amen when
[1:07:34] the waves come and when things we don't
[1:07:36] understand and we just wonder why it is
[1:07:38] the way why it has to be the way that it
[1:07:39] is and and and wondering Lord do you
[1:07:42] even care are you even are you in
[1:07:44] control where are you in all of this
[1:07:46] amen but yet his presence Amen never
[1:07:49] left for a moment Amen it might have
[1:07:51] looked like he was sleeping but the
[1:07:53] important thing was he was there and he
[1:07:55] was there then there was no wave that
[1:07:57] could seek that boat there was no storm
[1:08:00] that could tip it over as long as he was
[1:08:02] in the boat amen
[1:08:04] so we're resting not in our self not in
[1:08:07] the makeup of these mud ships not in the
[1:08:10] waves that we think we can crest but our
[1:08:11] rest is he's in the boat his presence on
[1:08:16] the inside gives us peace amen but you
[1:08:20] see but I was marveling at this
[1:08:22] situation because it's so it's so
[1:08:24] perfect to the day that we're living in
[1:08:26] how his disciples didn't understand
[1:08:28] everything that was going on maybe they
[1:08:29] were looking at the crowds getting
[1:08:31] smaller maybe they were looking at the
[1:08:32] critics rising up they were they looking
[1:08:34] at this one and that one and this
[1:08:36] struggle and this seemed like this
[1:08:37] unanswered prayer or whatever would be
[1:08:39] amen and becoming discouraged amen and
[1:08:42] I'm marveling they're on that boat and
[1:08:44] here's the one that the scripture said
[1:08:46] was going to be the Prince of Peace and
[1:08:48] he was going to bring peace to the world
[1:08:50] he was going to take the throne of David
[1:08:52] amen he was going to bring order to
[1:08:54] everything but they're in a storm
[1:08:58] there's no peace there was no peace in
[1:09:01] the world
[1:09:02] amen there was no peace on that sea but
[1:09:05] there was peace on the boat amen so you
[1:09:08] see Jesus brings the correction amen
[1:09:10] there they're saying where where's peace
[1:09:12] but Jesus said think not I'm coming to
[1:09:14] bring peace to this world he said I came
[1:09:16] not to send peace but a sword amen
[1:09:18] he said I came to divide I came to I'm
[1:09:21] not bringing peace it's not coming he
[1:09:22] said it's not coming
[1:09:23] this coming you're looking your thing
[1:09:25] about a son of David Rainey said but but
[1:09:27] but I'm not bringing peace to the world
[1:09:28] and neither is it today friends when we
[1:09:30] look at the state of the world that
[1:09:31] we're living in the message didn't bring
[1:09:33] peace to the whole world it brought an
[1:09:35] indictment but to us it was Shalom
[1:09:38] hallelujah amen because the message to
[1:09:41] the elect it's peace in spite of the
[1:09:43] storm in spite of the state of the world
[1:09:46] in spite of the temptations and the
[1:09:48] trial that we're going through he's in
[1:09:50] the boat so here there's peace there's
[1:09:53] peace where we are all see their
[1:09:55] expectation was all wrong and even the
[1:09:57] ones who heard his met came out heard
[1:09:59] his message Amen or they were there for
[1:10:01] the healing campaign that scripture says
[1:10:03] there are couples verses up how all they
[1:10:05] heard was parables they didn't couldn't
[1:10:07] understand it all it wasn't a quarter of
[1:10:09] their taste
[1:10:10] it wasn't according to their expectation
[1:10:12] Oh master don't you care that we perish
[1:10:14] amen but he said peace be still brother
[1:10:18] Breton said go away Jean he said he said
[1:10:20] you you you can awake him today amen
[1:10:23] however if you're one of those mud ships
[1:10:25] born-again Holy Ghost on the inside you
[1:10:28] can wake him amen you're going through a
[1:10:30] storm you can wake him today
[1:10:31] and brother Graham said it didn't have
[1:10:33] to be old master Oh master oh Jesus amen
[1:10:36] Oh in a panic and worried but just
[1:10:38] master amen Oh hallelujah
[1:10:41] and then he would rise he we can wake
[1:10:44] Jesus this morning Alleluia but not if
[1:10:48] you're looking at the circumstances in
[1:10:49] the world but look who's in the boat
[1:10:51] friends don't look at what the critics
[1:10:53] say about the message look at the Christ
[1:10:55] that's in this message the life that's
[1:10:58] in this message it'll bring you peace
[1:11:01] it'll bring peace it'll give you
[1:11:03] preeminence hey man amen and he rises up
[1:11:06] speaks peace to that storm because he
[1:11:09] was the master of the storm he's the
[1:11:11] Prince he was the Prince he see but they
[1:11:14] were looking for they were looking for
[1:11:16] what they thought I should be they
[1:11:18] thought I should be peace in the world
[1:11:19] they thought I should be peace in
[1:11:21] Jerusalem but it was peace on the boat
[1:11:23] amen because the prince was on the boat
[1:11:25] so friends don't worry when the
[1:11:28] circumstances don't match your
[1:11:30] expectations and I'm not just talking
[1:11:33] about our personal Christian lives I'm
[1:11:34] talking about this message this move of
[1:11:37] odd what this revival coming to this
[1:11:38] bride when it doesn't match our
[1:11:40] expectations it ought not to shake us a
[1:11:42] bit Amen because every every storm every
[1:11:45] every trial that said is to prove who's
[1:11:47] in the boat a man that's why that's why
[1:11:51] he brought a storm oh my and I love this
[1:11:53] quote an endtime evangelism brother
[1:11:54] brems said that see now think about art
[1:11:57] now change your expectation let the
[1:11:59] message change the way that we think
[1:12:01] this morning he said it seems like at
[1:12:02] the end time that the message and
[1:12:06] messenger both is about broke he said it
[1:12:09] looks like Satan is trying to rim wreck
[1:12:10] us it looks like we're defeated but
[1:12:15] don't you worry he said you know it's
[1:12:18] usually in that time when God steps in
[1:12:21] at the scene amen
[1:12:23] he's been watching for a long time amen
[1:12:28] and it's always in those weakest moments
[1:12:31] when it looks like the true message is
[1:12:33] just about defeated that's when God
[1:12:36] steps in and he lets the messenger and
[1:12:39] the message get to the end of the road
[1:12:41] and then he comes in and rides the high
[1:12:43] waves hallelujah amen that's what I
[1:12:47] believe
[1:12:48] amen oh that's the kind of God I sure
[1:12:51] Amen many times he seems like he's
[1:12:52] sitting back and just watching watching
[1:12:54] our reaction watching our faith watching
[1:12:57] our tests watching our trial but don't
[1:12:59] be afraid friends amen when it comes
[1:13:01] down to that weak moment when it comes
[1:13:03] down to the end it seems like it seems
[1:13:05] like it's all falling apart that's when
[1:13:07] he steps in and the master of the wind
[1:13:09] rides the high waves amen and the boat
[1:13:12] that you're in will never go under as
[1:13:14] long as he's at the helm he might steer
[1:13:17] you through a store and he might take
[1:13:18] you over some waves and down in his from
[1:13:20] valleys but he's in the boat and it'll
[1:13:24] never sink as long as he's in there
[1:13:26] amen amen the Prince of Peace amen as
[1:13:30] Christians we often look for peace and
[1:13:32] find a storm how many times are we
[1:13:35] looking for a looking for an answer
[1:13:37] looking for a peace looking for a
[1:13:40] looking for an oasis looking for a rest
[1:13:42] and we find another storm and another
[1:13:44] storm and another trial and another
[1:13:47] tribulation
[1:13:49] but not realizing that the piece is in
[1:13:52] us not in the conditions not in the
[1:13:57] surroundings not in the circumstances
[1:13:58] but in here amen
[1:14:01] oh if I go to prepare a place for you I
[1:14:04] will not leave you comfortless peace I
[1:14:08] leave with you my peace I give to you
[1:14:10] not as the world giveth let not your
[1:14:15] heart be troubled neither let it be
[1:14:16] afraid not as the world gives Amen not a
[1:14:21] worldly peace but his peace and what is
[1:14:24] it it's that comforter it's that holy
[1:14:26] spirit on the inside
[1:14:27] bringing us peace oh my you're not alone
[1:14:30] friends many times we feel like we're
[1:14:32] going through life's trials and we feel
[1:14:34] like we're going in alone like heaven is
[1:14:36] shut and God's not answering but but the
[1:14:38] but but what but all through the Bible
[1:14:40] he's given us the instruction he's given
[1:14:42] us the exam
[1:14:43] he took the three Hebrew children amen
[1:14:45] going into the fire and they didn't know
[1:14:47] if they were going to come out of it
[1:14:48] they had nothing to tell them that they
[1:14:51] were going to survive that ordeal but
[1:14:53] what they what but what the answer that
[1:14:55] they had was to just be still just take
[1:14:58] another step a man had come to find out
[1:15:00] the fire only served to prove who was
[1:15:03] with them the whole time a man the only
[1:15:05] thing the fire kigu was take away the
[1:15:08] bondage hey man you're not alone friends
[1:15:11] you might feel load you might not know
[1:15:13] what's around the corner
[1:15:14] but you're not alone you're not forsaken
[1:15:16] he's with you even in you even to the
[1:15:20] end of this world Lord of God you might
[1:15:23] be struggling with the Lord like Jacob
[1:15:25] struggle just wrestling sing God I need
[1:15:27] an answer I need I need something Lord I
[1:15:30] need a breakthrough I feel like I'm
[1:15:32] falling apart I feel like I'm coming
[1:15:33] down to the end of my last straw and
[1:15:35] what did the God do he let Jacob come to
[1:15:38] the very last straw amen brother Brad
[1:15:40] said God took Jacob wrestling with that
[1:15:42] angel and he took him to the very end of
[1:15:45] his human strength until he had come to
[1:15:48] just just the verge of death until his
[1:15:51] strength was gone he couldn't stand
[1:15:53] anymore couldn't walk right amen and
[1:15:55] wrestling with the Lord until brother
[1:15:58] Aaron said
[1:15:58] crippled and it was weak just like we
[1:16:01] get spiritually sometimes but watch now
[1:16:03] what came in the morning what came in
[1:16:07] the morning brother man said a fearless
[1:16:09] Prince hey manna and every Christian you
[1:16:12] might be wrestling with God today but
[1:16:14] just wait joy comes in the morning amen
[1:16:18] something's coming strength comes in the
[1:16:20] morning the joy of the Lord will be your
[1:16:22] strength hallelujah
[1:16:25] a fearless Prince I love it I love the
[1:16:28] way the prophet preaches that Amen one
[1:16:30] day what a difference one night can make
[1:16:33] just a couple hours in his presence
[1:16:36] until you've wrestled until you've just
[1:16:38] come to the end of the rope and then
[1:16:39] find within yourself a strength that
[1:16:42] will you didn't fake was there because
[1:16:44] it wasn't their friends it wasn't there
[1:16:46] when you were looking at your straight

[1:35:32] whatever stain we find ourselves friends
[1:35:34] to God be the glory I believe there's
[1:35:38] something special in the heart of the
[1:35:40] bride of Jesus Christ because of the
[1:35:41] love that she has for her bridegroom
[1:35:43] there's a trust there there's a perfect
[1:35:45] faith there in the one that has loved
[1:35:47] her the one that has nurtured her the
[1:35:49] one that has covered and protected her
[1:35:51] that when she has to go through
[1:35:52] something when she has to go through a
[1:35:54] trial there's just a strength in the
[1:35:56] bride of Jesus Christ a desire in the
[1:35:59] heart of a true believer say God I don't
[1:36:01] know what you're doing I don't know

[1:36:37] that's the bride of Jesus Christ amen
[1:36:40] when the storms come when the waves come
[1:36:42] to God be the glory
[1:36:44] he's in control he knows what he's doing
[1:36:46] God's got this friends he's got a
[1:36:49] purpose he's got a plan for it all amen
[1:36:53] doesn't always bring comfort to our
[1:36:56] emotions but it brings something to our
[1:36:58] heart a peace a rest now for him to get
[1:37:02] the glory it can't be yours or mine no
[1:37:07] for him to get the glory it's not going
[1:37:09] to be my opinion in your opinion the way
[1:37:11] I think it ought to be and the way we
[1:37:14] ought to run things around here No oh my
[1:37:17] he could never get the glory in that
[1:37:19] kind of environment France it's not
[1:37:21] going to be your church or my church or
[1:37:23] that ministry or this ministry or that
[1:37:25] one or this celebrity Amen or this
[1:37:27] politic it's got to be the word has to
[1:37:30] be the preeminent one
[1:37:31] amen amen that's why we have a wonderful
[1:37:33] fellowship with brother Samuel I believe
[1:37:35] in this church the word has the
[1:37:36] preeminence and never let it be friends
[1:37:39] don't ever think that you a men aren't
[1:37:41] important enough in your opinion or your
[1:37:43] idea or your direction or your vision
[1:37:46] amen to bring something that's not
[1:37:47] according to this word because it's not
[1:37:49] your work it's not a man's work not
[1:37:51] brother Sanders work it's God's work
[1:37:53] just let him work hallelujah let it be
[1:37:59] the preeminent woman friends Amen we've
[1:38:01] got to in this crucial hour we have got
[1:38:04] to keep the vision amen my heart for you
[1:38:06] though this morning a manicure hold fast
[1:38:09] to this vision hold fast to this word
[1:38:11] let it be the bridge now more than ever
[1:38:12] let it have the preeminence friends for
[1:38:15] the devil is raging he's brought up
[1:38:16] every storm he's tried to whip up
[1:38:18] everything trying to bring a division
[1:38:20] trying to bring disagreements trying to
[1:38:22] bring hurt feelings and everywhere he
[1:38:24] can get a foothold he's trying to come
[1:38:26] in and and split things up and pull it
[1:38:28] apart but friends when he has the
[1:38:30] preeminence when the Prince of Peace has
[1:38:32] the preeminence the devil will never
[1:38:34] have a foothold but you've got to give
[1:38:37] him the preeminence we can't just get
[1:38:39] distracted by earthly politics when we
[1:38:41] belong to an attorney
[1:38:42] kingdom an eternal Kingdom France amen
[1:38:45] and when we get over there it won't
[1:38:46] matter anymore who's who and who said
[1:38:48] what and what's going on there and what
[1:38:51] they're preaching down there and you
[1:38:52] know our church we shout and they don't
[1:38:54] and we sing this and they don't we don't
[1:38:56] have time for that friends amen it's too
[1:38:58] late of an hour not trying to do a work
[1:39:01] don't get distracted now keep the vision
[1:39:04] keep the word the preeminent one and
[1:39:07] watch what God's fixing to do I feel
[1:39:09] with everything that's in me that we
[1:39:11] aren't in to move friends there's
[1:39:13] something in the air
[1:39:14] amen I'm not just saying that to stir
[1:39:16] somebody up it's in my every thought
[1:39:17] throughout the day throughout the weeks
[1:39:19] in the months God is doing a work
[1:39:21] friends in this time in this season
[1:39:23] there's something happening with the
[1:39:25] bride the move is on for the bride I
[1:39:28] feel that Russell amen I know
[1:39:32] something's coming something's happening
[1:39:35] already
[1:39:36] amen amen I believe that I believe that
[1:39:40] so I'm not going to get caught up in
[1:39:42] this and caught up in that we got to
[1:39:44] rise above those things you know exactly
[1:39:46] what it is brother Bram said God created
[1:39:48] the wind and God created the water it
[1:39:50] was a work of God just like God brings
[1:39:52] the church God raised up a church God
[1:39:54] raised up a ministry God raised up a man
[1:39:55] or a woman or a deacon or whatever amen
[1:39:58] and God created it but what it is the
[1:40:00] devil got into that the devil got into
[1:40:03] that wind and brother Bram said that's
[1:40:05] the way it isn't believers sometimes
[1:40:07] they let down the bars the unbelief and
[1:40:10] their Satan comes in with a whirlwind
[1:40:12] causes fusses and stret and stews and
[1:40:16] arguments and everything that's the
[1:40:17] devil getting among people the Prince of
[1:40:19] the power of the air what a quote now
[1:40:23] those disciples should have said now
[1:40:25] there's something wrong here something
[1:40:27] wrong there lays the Creator right there
[1:40:30] right there but instead of looking at
[1:40:33] that personal presence of the literal
[1:40:35] life of Jesus Christ they were looking
[1:40:38] at the store looking at what the devil
[1:40:40] did devil will split a church raise up a
[1:40:43] critic bring a falling away amen
[1:40:46] some turmoil some drama some whatever he
[1:40:48] could do trying to take our eyes and get
[1:40:51] us looking at the storms of this life
[1:40:53] but the prints that's in this boat
[1:40:55] the
[1:40:55] Prince of Peace is greater than the
[1:40:57] Prince of the power of the air and there
[1:40:59] is nothing he can stir there is nothing
[1:41:00] he can bring up that our Lord cannot
[1:41:02] bring peace amen for he's the master of
[1:41:05] every storm friend you know what that
[1:41:07] means to me when he has the preeminence
[1:41:10] we can have unity in the church we can
[1:41:14] have resolution now you say now we got
[1:41:17] this bad situation this there that
[1:41:19] whatever you know I don't know what's
[1:41:20] what what you all deal with but people
[1:41:22] are people
[1:41:23] Amen and so this one rubs against that
[1:41:26] one and this rise up and this happens
[1:41:27] and there's this falling out of
[1:41:29] disagreement I believe with all my heart
[1:41:31] that because we have the Prince of Peace
[1:41:33] Amen that there can be a resolution
[1:41:36] there are no impossible situations there
[1:41:39] are there is nothing impossible
[1:41:40] there is no storm that he cannot master
[1:41:42] no matter how bad it looks no matter
[1:41:44] that you might feel like things are
[1:41:45] falling apart it's not going to fall
[1:41:47] apart there's someone who can hold it
[1:41:49] together let's wake him up wake him up
[1:41:51] in my life
[1:41:52] wake him up in your life say Jesus Amen
[1:41:54] I'm calling on you Lord be president be
[1:41:57] preeminent and speak peace to my sister
[1:42:00] oh that's why Ephesians 4 they're
[1:42:02] talking about this adoption endeavoring
[1:42:04] to keep the unity of the Spirit in the
[1:42:06] bond of peace what is that bond of peace
[1:42:08] one body one spirit one hope one Lord
[1:42:12] one faith one baptism one God and Father
[1:42:15] of all who is above all and through all
[1:42:17] and in you all if he's in you and he has
[1:42:21] the preeminence in you and he has the
[1:42:23] preeminence in me we might disagree
[1:42:25] bitterly but we can get through it
[1:42:26] flinch
[1:42:27] you got to believe it amen amen
[1:42:30] somebody somebody enter in on this with
[1:42:32] me we can't overcome these things we
[1:42:34] can't get victory over these sake we can
[1:42:37] get the resolution we can get the
[1:42:38] victory of course we can we have the
[1:42:41] Prince of Peace hallelujah friends we
[1:42:44] get so discouraged looking at the state
[1:42:46] of this world and there because there's
[1:42:48] no peace in politics and there's no
[1:42:50] peace in Jerusalem and there's no peace
[1:42:52] in the churches and there's no peace in
[1:42:54] this world but there's peace and you and
[1:42:57] I the Prince of Peace
[1:42:59] peace himself amen if you don't have it
[1:43:02] you can have it
[1:43:04] if there's a problem we can fix it a man
[1:43:07] if there's a stroke if there's a storm
[1:43:09] we can get through it France his speak
[1:43:11] peace amen
[1:43:13] remember that he is our peace who had
[1:43:16] broken down the middle wall broken down
[1:43:18] the wall of partition the one who
[1:43:19] brought you out of every denomination
[1:43:21] every background drug addiction amen
[1:43:24] alcoholism and and every other sinful
[1:43:26] state amen the ones that you were there
[1:43:28] out and some hypocritical Church you
[1:43:30] were worse off amen but but what but it
[1:43:32] was not something that was too great for
[1:43:34] God to come into the storm of your life
[1:43:36] and with him if he brought peace then he
[1:43:38] can bring peace now the same one Amen
[1:43:41] who calm the storms of your life and
[1:43:42] brought you into that boat and took you
[1:43:44] on this journey amen he's not left you
[1:43:47] he's not forsaken you
[1:43:49] amen he is our peace Oh
[1:43:54] brother Brad said what a safety it is
[1:43:57] today to know that the very God that
[1:44:00] made heavens and earth that may this
[1:44:03] dust that we dwell in these mud ships is
[1:44:06] sailing down life sea with us knowing
[1:44:10] that sickness and pain upsets us and
[1:44:12] death stares us in the face but what
[1:44:16] have we got to dread
[1:44:17] the very creator of these 16 elements
[1:44:20] that makes us up sails with us through
[1:44:24] every storm and every seed his truth can
[1:44:27] never fail he is with us and said lo I
