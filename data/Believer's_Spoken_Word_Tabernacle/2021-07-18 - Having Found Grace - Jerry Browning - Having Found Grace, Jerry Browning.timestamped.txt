[27:54] amen amen he is wonderful isn't he
[27:59] amen what a what a privilege and an
[28:02] honor it is to serve the lord jesus
[28:04] amen it was that song that we were
[28:06] singing amen behold elijah's god is
[28:10] here with us today amen it's it's
[28:13] it's a reality you know it's one thing
[28:15] to recognize
[28:16] what where god was and what god was
[28:19] doing
[28:20] but it's another thing to recognize
[28:22] where god is
[28:24] amen in order to go from where he was to
[28:26] where
[28:27] shall be you must recognize the present
[28:31] amen and god is present in his body of
[28:34] believers
[28:35] amen one thing that we can we can all
[28:37] agree on is that
[28:38] the message of the hour came to bring us
[28:41] into a relationship
[28:42] with jesus christ it came as a reality
[28:46] for you and i god manifested himself
[28:49] to reveal himself that he's the same
[28:52] yesterday today and forever
[28:55] what has that done for you and i it
[28:57] built our faith
[28:59] in the word of god amen we are we are
[29:02] standing
[29:03] like abraham stood amen we're a blessed
[29:06] people in this hour
[29:08] amen to be able to to recognize those
[29:10] things
[29:11] and to stand here and though you go
[29:13] through tests and trials and though
[29:15] there's discouragements that come
[29:17] i won't ask you to raise your hand but
[29:18] all throughout this building there's
[29:19] tests and trials and there's times that
[29:22] that maybe you felt like you were going
[29:23] to give up and you were discouraged but
[29:25] you must remember is that he that begun
[29:28] the good work in you
[29:30] he'll finish it amen and when you look
[29:33] at the tests and trials you know when we
[29:35] see him in in even in the right light
[29:37] and i think it becomes more and more
[29:39] clear as you recognize that in the midst
[29:41] of a test of trial where the frailty of
[29:43] our
[29:44] our vessel is exposed our humanity that
[29:47] includes your body your spirit but yet
[29:49] in the midst of that god's strength
[29:52] prevails
[29:53] and you can stand back and look and say
[29:55] you know what it's not i who liveth but
[29:57] christ who liveth in me
[29:58] and so then the test and the trial
[30:00] itself has come out
[30:01] and it's a blessing amen because once
[30:04] again it's shown
[30:05] that the deity of jesus christ is
[30:08] present
[30:08] in your life amen we just love him don't
[30:12] we
[30:12] amen sometimes we don't feel like in the
[30:15] midst of joy in the midst of test or
[30:17] trial but you know joy isn't about
[30:19] bubble dancing
[30:20] joy is a condition that rests upon i
[30:23] know
[30:24] in whom i have believed and i am
[30:26] persuaded that he
[30:28] is able to keep that which i've
[30:30] committed against that day
[30:32] amen we certainly just love you in the
[30:34] lord and just want to remind
[30:36] you and um out there in the

[37:20] the tears of love on his face
[37:24] he said i want to make you clean

[37:33] and as we opened up the door
[37:38] and the two of us walked in
[37:43] i was so ashamed

[37:51] but when i think about that room now
[37:55] i'm not ashamed anymore
[38:00] because i know my hidden sin
[38:04] no longer hides behind that door
[38:09] it was a place in my heart
[38:13] where even i wouldn't go

[41:47] i pray god that you would just lead us
[41:49] in that way
[41:50] lord supply the needs lord that you know
[41:53] that they have today
[41:55] lord we ask it in jesus christ's name
[41:58] amen
[42:00] i'd like to read from genesis chapter 6
[42:02] beginning at verse 1.
[42:34] what i want to speak on today
[42:37] is having found grace
[42:41] and it came to pass when men began to
[42:44] multiply on the face of the earth
[42:46] and the daughters were born unto them
[42:49] but the sons of god saw the daughters of
[42:51] men that they were fair
[42:53] and they took them wives of all which
[42:56] they chose
[42:58] and the lord said my spirit shall not
[43:00] always strive with man
[43:02] for that he also is flesh yet his day
[43:06] shall be a hundred and twenty years
[43:09] there were giants in the earth in those
[43:11] days
[43:12] and also after that when the sons of god
[43:15] came in unto the daughters of men
[43:17] they bear children unto them the same
[43:19] became mighty men which were of old men
[43:22] of renown
[43:23] and god saw the wickedness of man was
[43:25] great in the earth
[43:27] and that every imagination of the
[43:29] thoughts of his heart was only
[43:30] evil continually and it repented the
[43:33] lord
[43:34] that he had made man on earth and he
[43:36] grieved him at his heart
[43:38] and the lord said i will destroy men
[43:40] whom i have created from the face of the
[43:42] earth
[43:43] both man and beast and creeping thing
[43:45] and fouls of the air
[43:46] for it repenteth me that i have made
[43:48] them
[43:50] but noah found grace in the eyes of the
[43:53] lord
[43:55] these are the generations of noah noah
[43:57] was a just man
[43:59] and perfect in his generation and noah
[44:02] walked with god
[44:03] amen you may be seated
[44:12] the bible tells us the earth was filled
[44:14] with violence
[44:16] during this time it tells us that
[44:19] the earth was corrupt that all flesh
[44:23] had corrupted their way
[44:26] brother branham says if you ever notice
[44:29] whenever men begin to multiply
[44:32] people begin to get together great
[44:34] gatherings of people
[44:35] and remain and that city becoming
[44:38] populated more population
[44:40] the first thing you know it begins to
[44:42] bring in diversities for recreation
[44:46] from that it goes into gambling and from
[44:49] gambling into drinking and from drinking
[44:51] into prostitution and breaking up of
[44:54] homes and marriages and divorce
[44:56] and then murder and it keeps growing and
[44:58] growing and growing like a chain
[45:01] of no end but when god walked with man
[45:04] alone by himself
[45:06] he had favor with god but when
[45:09] man begins to multiply and begins to get
[45:12] others and others and others
[45:14] satan having more of a range to work in
[45:17] the man begin to believe a little bit
[45:19] leaning in this way and the other a
[45:21] little bit this way and then
[45:23] when satan comes in he just fires it on
[45:27] then it becomes this and that and
[45:28] imaginations begin to
[45:30] come great and then corruption sets in
[45:35] we know in the the bible tells us
[45:39] that the thing that hath been is that
[45:43] which shall be and that which
[45:45] is done is that which shall be done and
[45:47] that there is no new thing under the sun
[45:52] many times when we think about noah's
[45:53] day we think
[45:55] in terms of being more primitive
[45:59] but that's just the opposite of what it
[46:01] was
[46:02] the prophet tells us that noah's day was
[46:05] very advanced
[46:07] he says they could shoot rockets into
[46:09] the sky
[46:11] and know there was no moisture up there
[46:14] they if they could shoot rockets in the
[46:16] sky
[46:17] then that means they could build great
[46:19] ships themselves
[46:21] the prophet even said they had their own
[46:23] boats
[46:25] and then so
[46:28] it was it was not a primitive time
[46:32] but when god began to the reason a lot
[46:34] of people think of it being more
[46:36] primitive
[46:36] is because of the design of the ark
[46:41] and if you think about that age being so
[46:44] far
[46:44] advanced then when the people of that
[46:47] day would begin to see the ark being
[46:49] built to them
[46:50] it would have looked primitive it would
[46:53] not have looked
[46:54] like their ways it wouldn't
[46:58] it would not have looked safe to them no
[47:01] doubt
[47:01] in that day they had a ship that could
[47:04] not be sunk
[47:06] because there's nothing new under the
[47:08] sun so i'm sure
[47:10] you know today what the titanic is most
[47:13] remembered for
[47:14] is sinking
[47:18] and so noah began to build this but this
[47:22] ark was so great
[47:23] in size that it was an eyesore to the
[47:27] city no doubt
[47:29] looking the way it looked and being so
[47:31] large they could see it from everywhere
[47:33] in the city
[47:34] so they were constantly reminded that
[47:36] noah what's telling them
[47:38] it's going to do something that it's
[47:40] never happened before
[47:42] they were constantly reminded that noah
[47:44] was preaching to them
[47:46] that it's going to rain and notice that
[47:49] peter says noah preached
[47:51] 120 years and so you can imagine noah
[47:55] getting up
[47:56] maybe a year 100 and saying you know the
[47:59] sky looks clear today
[48:01] like it always has they said maybe
[48:03] noah's going to preach something
[48:04] different today
[48:06] and then he would say but i'm going to
[48:07] tell you something the sun's not always
[48:09] going to shine
[48:10] because it's going to rain yes there he
[48:13] goes again
[48:14] preaching the same thing again but
[48:18] it's because it was the message of the
[48:20] hour
[48:21] and that's what we've got to preach if
[48:23] we don't have something different to
[48:25] preach
[48:26] we've got the message of the hour to
[48:28] preach
[48:29] and the message of the hour is this
[48:31] message of salvation
[48:33] it is a message of escape it is a
[48:36] message of deliverance
[48:37] it is a message that will set you free
[48:40] it's a message that will take you home
[48:43] it's a message that will change you
[48:46] eternally
[48:58] and god in his sovereign grace looked
[49:01] down
[49:02] and saw noah now
[49:05] i want you to realize something it isn't
[49:09] the way i just said it would make it
[49:11] seem like that god was looking over the
[49:14] face of the earth and he saw all the
[49:15] wickedness and everything and all man
[49:17] and then after he decided he was going
[49:19] to destroy it then he noticed noah
[49:21] no noah was part of god
[49:26] there was a part of god in noah
[49:30] amen and so
[49:33] that's why noah found grace in the eyes
[49:36] of the lord
[49:38] and god in his grace
[49:41] not wanting anyone to perish really
[49:44] i know the bible says he was going to
[49:46] destroy man but he weighed a wave escape
[49:49] so that all that would believe
[49:52] would have a way to escape the prophet
[49:55] says
[49:56] he made a way of escape so that everyone
[49:59] of that age that desire
[50:02] to escape could escape
[50:17] and the bible tells us that that day is
[50:19] going to repeat again
[50:23] as it was in the days of noah
[50:26] amen the bible tells us so shall it be
[50:30] the days of the son of man they didn't
[50:33] eat they drank they married wives they
[50:35] were given in marriage until the day
[50:37] noah entered into the ark
[50:39] and the flood come and destroyed them
[50:41] all
[50:44] said it's going to repeat again but
[50:48] don't forget
[50:50] it also says as it was in the days of
[50:52] life
[50:56] in a days of lot if you recall
[50:59] when the two angels went down to bring
[51:02] lot out of sodom
[51:04] that the men of the city saw
[51:08] these two angels to them they appeared
[51:12] as men
[51:14] and they went to lot's house and said
[51:17] bring them men out to us so we can know
[51:20] them
[51:23] i know this isn't politically correct
[51:25] anymore
[51:26] as they call it but sodom was
[51:30] full of homosexuality
[51:34] and that's what's come upon this earth
[51:36] again today
[51:38] and in sodom there was nothing there's
[51:41] nothing new
[51:42] they had their rights
[51:46] they wanted their rights and they
[51:49] thought it was a right to them to have
[51:51] whoever they wanted
[51:52] and they wanted these men remember lot
[51:55] offered them his daughters
[51:59] and they were virgins and they were
[52:02] married
[52:05] his two daughters were married but lot
[52:07] said i'll give you my two daughters who
[52:09] have never known a man
[52:12] it meant that their husbands were
[52:16] homosexuals
[52:20] they said no we don't want your
[52:22] daughters we don't want your women
[52:25] we want those two men and the bible says
[52:27] they
[52:28] pressed so hard they were beginning to
[52:30] bust the door down
[52:33] and the angels had to blind them so that
[52:36] they could go out and take lot and his
[52:38] family with them
[52:41] but also it says remember lot's wife
[52:48] was too brought out but there was part
[52:51] of her
[52:52] that stayed back there and that was her
[52:54] heart
[52:54] [Applause]
[52:56] and she turned to look back and they
[52:59] were told don't even look
[53:00] back to see god's judgment friends we're
[53:04] going to be leaving this world
[53:05] and not even looking back to see the
[53:08] judgments of god that set in
[53:11] we're not going to be here when the
[53:12] tribulation period takes effect
[53:16] the prophet said cut me open fill me
[53:19] full of suffer
[53:20] and set me on fire but don't let me go
[53:22] through that tribulation
[53:24] it's going to be a terrible time but we
[53:26] won't be seeing it because we won't be
[53:29] here
[53:29] [Music]
[53:31] but lot's wife looked back because she
[53:34] didn't want to leave and there are
[53:37] people today
[53:39] that have heard this message and have
[53:41] come out with us
[53:43] but they're turning back and they're
[53:45] going back to the same
[53:47] pig walla they came out of they're going
[53:50] back to the denominations
[53:52] they're turning back away from the
[53:53] message they're
[53:55] they're getting on the internet and
[53:57] they're trying to
[53:58] tear apart and tear down anything
[54:01] associated
[54:02] with this message and with the profit of
[54:05] this
[54:06] hour it's happening again
[54:14] and she was turned to a pillar of salt
[54:25] look at the day we're living in see how
[54:29] bad it's getting
[54:31] it says in the days of noah there was
[54:33] violence
[54:34] in the earth
[54:38] doubt there was peaceful protests
[54:47] guess i should have put air quotes
[54:48] around that
[54:52] tearing down statues and tearing down
[54:55] different things
[54:57] and and setting things on fire and
[55:00] destroying buildings it's violence
[55:06] killing one another over what
[55:16] we're all human beings
[55:21] but you see
[55:24] the nature that's in the world
[55:28] it's different than the nature that you
[55:30] find
[55:31] in the lord
[55:35] that's right the racism you find
[55:40] out in the world you don't find that in
[55:42] the people of the lord
[55:48] don't bring them racial ideals into here
[55:52] because friends look if there is racism
[55:55] among the people of god then we're all
[55:57] in
[56:01] that's trouble there should be no racism
[56:03] among the people of god
[56:10] you want me to tell you whose lives
[56:12] matter the children of god's lives
[56:20] and he don't care what color you are he
[56:23] doesn't care what race you are what
[56:25] nationality you are
[56:26] he doesn't care what language you speak
[56:30] because the only reason we speak
[56:32] different languages is because of
[56:35] the tower of babel
[56:40] but we're going to go to a place where
[56:42] we'll all speak the same language
[56:45] [Applause]
[56:50] and it won't be a language that has
[56:52] slurs in it
[56:53] it won't be a language that has all
[56:55] these derogatory or curse words
[56:58] or any of this type of thing
[57:01] it'll be a pure holy language
[57:07] hallelujah oh hallelujah
[57:12] you know
[57:19] i just said those things to warn you
[57:21] watch those things that they don't creep
[57:23] into your mists
[57:30] because that's what satan would like to
[57:32] do
[57:33] is get that to creep into the churches
[57:35] and start tearing apart the churches
[57:44] noah found grace
[57:47] brother branham said that in that day no
[57:50] doubt they had
[57:51] a reno nevada or
[57:54] the likes thereof
[57:57] gambling and prostitution and
[58:00] drinking and all these things going on
[58:04] crime in the streets murder murdering
[58:06] one another
[58:10] we know where that started that
[58:12] murdering started back in the garden
[58:15] that murdering started back with cain
[58:20] who was of that wicked one
[58:28] hallelujah
[58:33] but there were scoffers in those days
[58:37] denying the words of truth
[58:42] denying that what mo noah was preaching
[58:46] was going to be a reality
[58:53] to them noah was preaching something
[58:56] that was
[58:57] a fantasy it was just something of
[59:00] fiction
[59:01] because up until that time the earth had
[59:04] been watered from a mist that rose up
[59:06] from the ground
[59:09] but god told noah it's going to rain
[59:13] in other words noah water's going to
[59:15] fall out of the sky
[59:19] and it's going to keep doing it for 40
[59:21] days and 40 nights
[59:24] and i'm going to flood the whole earth
[59:26] over
[59:27] how many has ever witnessed the flood
[59:29] somewhere where you lived or around or
[59:31] something
[59:34] it rains for days and days and the water
[59:36] raises up and then you start getting
[59:38] flash floods on the rivers
[59:40] and in the creeks that you used to be
[59:42] able to wade across now they're
[59:44] dangerous
[59:46] creeks that you could drive cars across
[59:48] and now
[59:49] they would take a four-wheel drive right
[59:51] down the creek with them
[59:55] we constantly in tennessee when we have
[59:57] flash floods there's always somebody
[59:59] losing a truck
[1:00:01] because we have a lot of those what i
[1:00:02] call underwater bridges
[1:00:05] you drive across the creek to get from
[1:00:07] one side of the road to the other
[1:00:10] and you drive through the creek and
[1:00:12] they're used to driving through these
[1:00:13] creeks and then they go to do it when
[1:00:14] the flash flood and the water's up
[1:00:16] and the next thing you know they're on
[1:00:18] top of their truck and they're having to
[1:00:19] go down there in boats to rescue these
[1:00:21] people
[1:00:24] and the thing about it is friends they
[1:00:26] got signs up
[1:00:28] that warned the people where these
[1:00:30] creeks are they got signs of warning
[1:00:32] them
[1:00:34] high water but
[1:00:37] people don't listen to warnings and
[1:00:39] that's what they're doing today
[1:00:41] there's warnings going out but people
[1:00:44] are not listening to the warnings
[1:00:46] [Applause]
[1:00:48] god they don't want to hear about
[1:00:49] there's coming an end to this earth
[1:00:51] they don't want to hear about that god's
[1:00:53] bringing judgment
[1:00:55] but it doesn't matter what they want to
[1:00:56] hear it's going to happen
[1:00:58] anyway
[1:01:00] [Applause]
[1:01:05] god gave noah a message of grace
[1:01:12] a wave escape salvation
[1:01:15] i'm so glad that i'm saved
[1:01:19] i'm so glad that i can say this morning
[1:01:21] i'm saved
[1:01:24] because it shows if you can say i'm
[1:01:26] saved this morning
[1:01:28] it shows you found grace in the eyes
[1:01:31] of the lord
[1:01:32] [Applause]
[1:01:36] noah found grace and god run away to
[1:01:39] of salvation for noah
[1:01:44] now we know that god knows
[1:01:47] everything it's his foreknowledge
[1:01:51] he knows who will and who won't god
[1:01:54] chooses according to election you
[1:01:56] believe in election don't you
[1:01:58] well you do if you believe the bible
[1:01:59] because it's in the bible
[1:02:03] and god knows everything that's going to
[1:02:06] happen
[1:02:07] so god knew in the days of noah he knew
[1:02:10] who was going to accept that message
[1:02:13] and he knew the vast majority was not
[1:02:15] going to accept it
[1:02:18] so god when he gave noah the dimensions
[1:02:21] to build the ark he gave him the
[1:02:24] dimensions that would
[1:02:25] house a family of eight and
[1:02:29] two of every animal that lived on the
[1:02:31] face of the earth
[1:02:32] and the bible says this it says bring
[1:02:36] into the ark male and female
[1:02:39] it didn't say bring into the ark a bunch
[1:02:41] of males
[1:02:42] bring to the ark a bunch of females if
[1:02:46] it had
[1:02:47] there have been more animals extinct all
[1:02:50] the animals would have been extinct
[1:02:56] he said bring male and female look i'm
[1:02:58] going to tell you something friends it's
[1:02:59] all throughout the bible
[1:03:03] but they don't want to believe it
[1:03:08] and if they continue to have their way
[1:03:10] about it
[1:03:11] they can arrest me for saying these
[1:03:13] things
[1:03:15] if they continue to either way about it
[1:03:17] they can force their way into your
[1:03:18] church
[1:03:26] i had a visitor come to our church
[1:03:29] i didn't know him it was somebody from
[1:03:32] the neighborhood
[1:03:33] but i didn't know him and i got up and
[1:03:36] preached that day and it just so
[1:03:38] happened that day that i preached on
[1:03:39] sodom
[1:03:41] i found out he got up and left i found
[1:03:43] out later
[1:03:45] he that he was a known homosexual there
[1:03:47] in that community
[1:03:51] well if i would have known he was a
[1:03:52] homosexual i'd still preach the same
[1:03:56] thing
[1:03:59] because i don't want that spirit in my
[1:04:00] church
[1:04:08] what they should have been doing was
[1:04:10] getting out in the middle
[1:04:12] of god's grace while there was grace to
[1:04:14] be had
[1:04:16] they should have got out in the middle
[1:04:17] of god's grace and cried for mercy
[1:04:26] there's going to come a flood noah
[1:04:29] but my grace is sufficient
[1:04:34] my grace is sufficient to take you
[1:04:37] through this flood
[1:04:40] hallelujah
[1:04:44] the lord never leaves himself without a
[1:04:46] witness
[1:04:51] it may come down sometimes to one man
[1:04:53] like noah
[1:04:55] but god's never without a witness
[1:04:59] it may come down sometime that you are
[1:05:01] the only one
[1:05:03] working in the place where you work as
[1:05:06] and you
[1:05:07] are the only witness of god there but
[1:05:09] god's never without a witness
[1:05:13] god always has a witness he always has
[1:05:15] somebody that he can say
[1:05:16] this is my servant he goes where i say
[1:05:20] go
[1:05:20] he goes when i say go he does what i
[1:05:23] tell you to do regardless of what
[1:05:25] anybody says
[1:05:26] he does it anyhow this is my beloved
[1:05:30] servant
[1:05:31] he always has somebody
[1:05:35] amen now
[1:05:38] brother branham said in that day just
[1:05:41] like today
[1:05:43] they were saying noah thinks he's the
[1:05:45] only one that's got truth
[1:05:50] noah thinks he's the only one that's
[1:05:51] going to be saved
[1:05:55] that's what they say about you
[1:05:58] what do you think you're the only one
[1:05:59] that's got the truth
[1:06:02] you think you're the only one that's
[1:06:03] going to be saved
[1:06:05] you know what the prophet's answer to
[1:06:07] that was he says
[1:06:09] these signs shall follow them to believe
[1:06:12] and he said that's not my word that's
[1:06:14] his word
[1:06:22] they would have said noah you think
[1:06:23] you're the only one that's gonna be
[1:06:24] saved he says well i'll tell you this
[1:06:27] only whoever gets in this ark is gonna
[1:06:29] be safe
[1:06:30] and i'm going to tell you something
[1:06:31] friends only those who get in christ
[1:06:34] are going to be saved not those who get
[1:06:37] in church
[1:06:40] but those who get in christ
[1:06:44] a pastor can't save you only god can
[1:06:47] save you
[1:06:50] jesus christ is the one who died for our
[1:06:53] sins
[1:06:53] amen the prophet can't save you
[1:06:59] jesus christ is the only one that can
[1:07:01] save you
[1:07:03] you've got to get into christ
[1:07:07] but what it was noah was given a message
[1:07:10] of grace
[1:07:11] and you know what they did they'd done
[1:07:13] despite into the spirit of grace
[1:07:17] they made fun of noah they mocked him
[1:07:20] they didn't believe
[1:07:22] they said we've got boats if it does
[1:07:24] flood we'll just get in our boats and
[1:07:26] we'll just float along with you
[1:07:28] but you see their boats weren't made to
[1:07:30] stand through the flood
[1:07:34] have you ever studied on gopher wood
[1:07:39] it's a very porous wood
[1:07:42] no doubt when they saw noah getting
[1:07:44] gopher wood to make the ark they thought
[1:07:47] this guy is really insane that's the
[1:07:49] last wood you'd want to make an ark with
[1:07:52] to make a boat but he wasn't making a
[1:07:55] boat
[1:08:00] but god told him you take pitch
[1:08:03] and you pitch it within and without and
[1:08:06] you see gopher wood being porous
[1:08:08] it soaked up all the pitch and made it
[1:08:10] impermeable to water
[1:08:12] [Applause]
[1:08:17] it become one with the pitch
[1:08:21] amen we've got to become one with this
[1:08:24] word
[1:08:26] this word is our ark this word this
[1:08:29] message
[1:08:30] is our way of escape
[1:08:31] [Applause]
[1:08:33] we've got to become one with christ
[1:08:36] hallelujah the bible says in hebrews
[1:08:40] for if we sin willfully after we receive
[1:08:42] the knowledge of the truth
[1:08:43] there remaineth no more sacrifice for
[1:08:45] sin
[1:08:46] but certain fearful looking for of
[1:08:49] judgment and fiery indignation
[1:08:51] which shall devour the adversaries he
[1:08:54] that despised moses law died without
[1:08:57] mercy under two or three witnesses
[1:08:59] of how much sore punishment suppose ye
[1:09:02] shall he be thought worthy
[1:09:03] who had trodden under foot the son of
[1:09:06] god and have counted the blood of the
[1:09:08] covenant wherewith he was sanctified
[1:09:10] an unholy thing and have done despite
[1:09:12] and to the spirit of grace
[1:09:15] the prophet says in sirs we would see
[1:09:17] jesus he said
[1:09:18] they tramped the blood of the covenant
[1:09:21] wherewith they were sanctified with
[1:09:23] and called it an unclean thing and done
[1:09:26] despite
[1:09:27] to the works of grace
[1:09:32] grace would have saved them the works of
[1:09:34] grace
[1:09:35] but they've done despite unto the works
[1:09:37] of grace there remaineth no more
[1:09:39] sacrifice for sin
[1:09:41] and people are doing despite to the very
[1:09:44] works of grace that
[1:09:45] that's called them to sanctification
[1:09:50] there's people that have come to this
[1:09:52] message friends
[1:09:54] and have turned their backs and walked
[1:09:56] away
[1:10:00] and and while they're doing it they
[1:10:03] sound
[1:10:04] ever so religious
[1:10:07] [Music]
[1:10:09] but then you know like everybody
[1:10:13] almost they post
[1:10:17] everything they do on social media
[1:10:21] so with their newfound revelation
[1:10:24] that goes beyond this message it now
[1:10:27] allows them to drink beer
[1:10:30] at least according to the pictures on
[1:10:32] social media
[1:10:38] it allows their women to wear clothes
[1:10:41] that they used to preach against
[1:10:49] they used to preach against skirts that
[1:10:51] had zipper in the front
[1:10:52] because they said oh it's a garment
[1:10:54] pertaining to a man but now they're
[1:10:55] wearing pants
[1:10:59] now they're wearing shorts
[1:11:05] what is it they're doing despite to the
[1:11:08] spirit of grace
[1:11:11] the grace where with god called them
[1:11:14] give them an opportunity they heard the
[1:11:17] words of truth
[1:11:19] they were enlightened
[1:11:26] with the truth now there remaineth no
[1:11:30] more sacrifice for their sins
[1:11:39] it wasn't noah's works that saved him
[1:11:44] it wasn't cause noah was a good moral
[1:11:46] man
[1:11:49] it wasn't because noah had never been
[1:11:51] thrown in jail
[1:11:53] it wasn't because noah was handsome
[1:11:56] it wasn't because he was better looking
[1:11:58] than the rest or
[1:11:59] belonged to a better church or had more
[1:12:02] money
[1:12:04] or belonged to a better organization
[1:12:09] it was god's grace that saved
[1:12:12] noah
[1:12:21] god's grace now
[1:12:24] why was it that noah found grace in the
[1:12:26] eyes of the lord
[1:12:27] we said because he belonged to god
[1:12:33] if you have found grace in the eyes of
[1:12:35] the lord
[1:12:38] it's because you belong to god
[1:12:42] [Applause]
[1:12:44] hallelujah it isn't because
[1:12:48] that you're you've been a good person
[1:12:51] it isn't because you've never done
[1:12:53] anything evil or wicked or
[1:12:55] or been in muck and mire of sin or
[1:12:58] was under some other kind of dogma of
[1:13:00] creed of a religion
[1:13:04] it's because of god's grace and you're
[1:13:07] here this morning because you found
[1:13:09] grace
[1:13:10] in the eyes of the lord god's extending
[1:13:13] grace
[1:13:15] and if you are here this morning and
[1:13:17] have said i
[1:13:18] have not found i don't know grace grace
[1:13:21] is being
[1:13:22] extended this morning
[1:13:28] the prophet gives a story about the
[1:13:30] little eagle we're all familiar with
[1:13:32] it about the little eagle they took an
[1:13:35] egg the farmer did and he put it under a
[1:13:37] hen and it hatched out this eagle in the
[1:13:39] barnyard
[1:13:41] and the eagle was down there and he saw
[1:13:42] the chicken scratching around
[1:13:45] they clucked he couldn't cluck
[1:13:49] they click click click look look but he
[1:13:51] couldn't speak their language
[1:13:53] it didn't sound right to him
[1:13:57] but it's all he'd ever heard right
[1:14:00] so it must be okay but it done something
[1:14:02] about it just ain't right
[1:14:05] but when that mother eagle flew over and
[1:14:08] she screamed
[1:14:11] there was something about that voice
[1:14:15] he had never heard that voice before
[1:14:19] but when he heard it that one time it
[1:14:22] brought something out in him and he
[1:14:24] screamed
[1:14:25] just like she screamed
[1:14:28] all of a sudden he's talking the same
[1:14:30] language she's talking he understands
[1:14:32] what's being said all the chickens
[1:14:35] around
[1:14:35] they didn't understand what was being
[1:14:37] said they didn't understand
[1:14:39] what what do you mean about seven seals
[1:14:40] seven church ages i don't understand
[1:14:42] that language
[1:14:43] but he understood it spoke something to
[1:14:47] him
[1:14:47] when it said i'll send malachi 4
[1:14:51] 5 before i destroy this earth that meant
[1:14:54] something to him
[1:14:56] he might not have been able to to sit
[1:14:58] down and explain it to you
[1:15:00] but something about it spoke to him
[1:15:04] something about it said i know that's
[1:15:06] true
[1:15:09] i want to know more i'm not satisfied
[1:15:12] yet i want more
[1:15:14] that's why jesus said if you knew who
[1:15:16] was talking to you
[1:15:17] you'd ask me for a drink and i'd give
[1:15:19] you a drink of water
[1:15:21] that you'd never thirst again i don't
[1:15:23] know why
[1:15:24] because it's an endless fountain of
[1:15:26] water
[1:15:27] it doesn't stop it keeps going on
[1:15:30] throughout eternity
[1:15:31] [Music]
[1:15:34] we don't know it all yet we might know a
[1:15:37] whole lot more than
[1:15:38] when we started out but there's still
[1:15:41] more to be revealed
[1:15:42] [Applause]
[1:15:44] not on this side the mysteries to be
[1:15:48] revealed on this side have been revealed
[1:15:51] but there is more that will be revealed
[1:15:53] once we
[1:15:54] go from this dimension to the next
[1:16:00] the half has not yet been told
[1:16:04] we talk about the body change of what
[1:16:07] we're going to be
[1:16:09] but i'm going to tell you something
[1:16:10] talking about it and thinking about it
[1:16:12] and
[1:16:13] and you know just uh dwelling on it
[1:16:17] ain't going to be nothing like it
[1:16:18] happening when it happens
[1:16:22] when it happens it's going to give you a
[1:16:25] feeling you couldn't get from thinking
[1:16:27] about it
[1:16:29] [Applause]
[1:16:30] hallelujah praise the lord
[1:16:34] every now and then i look back at
[1:16:37] pictures of myself when i was
[1:16:39] in my early 20s just so i'll recognize
[1:16:42] myself in the mirror one day
[1:16:51] what happened something in that eagle
[1:16:53] was quickened
[1:16:57] but the prophet says there has to be
[1:16:59] something there to be quickened
[1:17:03] there was nothing in them chickens to be
[1:17:04] quickened to that voice
[1:17:07] but there was something in that eagle
[1:17:08] that was quickened
[1:17:13] there was something in you to be
[1:17:15] quickened by when you heard the word
[1:17:17] of the hour
[1:17:20] and why was it that it was different for
[1:17:24] you
[1:17:24] because you found grace in the eyes of
[1:17:27] the lord
[1:17:28] because you belong to him
[1:17:31] hallelujah and you hath he quickened who
[1:17:35] were dead and trespassed in sin
[1:17:37] where in time past ye walked according
[1:17:39] to the course of this world
[1:17:40] according to the prince and power of the
[1:17:42] air the spirit that now
[1:17:44] worketh in the children of disobedience
[1:17:46] among whom also we all had our
[1:17:48] conversations in time past
[1:17:50] in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the
[1:17:51] desires of the flesh and of the mind
[1:17:53] and we're by nature the children of
[1:17:55] wrath even as others
[1:17:57] but god who is rich in mercy
[1:18:00] for his great love wherein he loved us
[1:18:03] notice
[1:18:04] loved us there wasn't a time that god
[1:18:06] came along and said i think
[1:18:08] i'll love you now he always loved you
[1:18:13] he loved you before the foundation of
[1:18:15] the world
[1:18:16] [Music]
[1:18:17] praise our god he loved you before you
[1:18:20] were a gleam in your daddy's eye
[1:18:25] he loved you before your great
[1:18:29] great great great granddad and grandma
[1:18:32] were ever even born he loved you
[1:18:37] he loved you with an eternal love
[1:18:41] it means he never started loving you
[1:18:44] and he's never going to stop loving you
[1:18:48] there's nothing you could do to make him
[1:18:50] love you more
[1:18:52] and there's nothing you've done that can
[1:18:54] make him love you less
[1:18:58] hallelujah even when we were dead and
[1:19:02] sins
[1:19:03] hath quickened us together with christ
[1:19:06] by grace you are saved
[1:19:08] and hath raised us up together and made
[1:19:10] us set together in heavenly places in
[1:19:12] christ jesus
[1:19:13] that in the ages that come he might
[1:19:15] shoot the exceeding riches of his grace
[1:19:17] in his kindness toward us through christ
[1:19:19] jesus
[1:19:20] for by grace are you saved through faith
[1:19:24] and that not of yourself it is a gift
[1:19:28] of god amen
[1:19:32] it is a gift of god
[1:19:37] now your character is not a gift
[1:19:41] it's a victory that's why you go through
[1:19:45] tests and trials and tribulations here
[1:19:49] think about it i'd rather go through
[1:19:51] some tribulations now
[1:19:53] than to be in the tribulation that's
[1:19:55] coming
[1:19:56] amen
[1:20:02] well that's another message
[1:20:06] hallelujah now i'd like to go to genesis
[1:20:10] chapter 18.
[1:20:23] genesis chapter 18 verse 1 and the lord
[1:20:26] appeared unto him in the plains of
[1:20:29] memory now
[1:20:29] speaking about abraham and sarah here
[1:20:32] and he sat
[1:20:33] in the tent door in the heat of the day
[1:20:37] and he lifted up his eyes and looked and
[1:20:39] lo three men stood by him
[1:20:41] and when he saw them he ran to meet them
[1:20:43] from the tent door and bowed himself
[1:20:45] toward the ground and said
[1:20:47] my lord if now i have found favor in thy
[1:20:51] sight pass not away i pray thee from thy
[1:20:53] servant
[1:20:55] let a little water i pray you be fetched
[1:20:57] and wash your feet and rest yourselves
[1:20:59] under the tree and i will fetch a morsel
[1:21:03] of bread and comfort ye
[1:21:04] your hearts after ye shall pass on
[1:21:08] for therefore are ye come to your
[1:21:11] servant
[1:21:12] and they said so do is thou a shed and
[1:21:15] abraham hastened to the tenant of sir
[1:21:17] and said make ready quickly three
[1:21:19] measures of fine meal
[1:21:21] knead it and make cakes upon the hearth
[1:21:25] and abraham ran into the herd and
[1:21:27] fetched a calf tender and good
[1:21:29] and gave it unto the young man and he
[1:21:33] hastened to dress it
[1:21:34] and he took butter and milk and the calf
[1:21:37] which he addressed and set it before
[1:21:39] them
[1:21:40] and he stood by them under the tree and
[1:21:42] they did eat
[1:21:45] god came down brother branham says he
[1:21:48] picked up some dust
[1:21:50] and some potash and and some
[1:21:53] petroleum and some other elements
[1:21:57] and he blew into them and made a body to
[1:22:00] step into
[1:22:01] then he made two bodies for the two
[1:22:03] angels that were with him
[1:22:07] and then they went to meet with abraham
[1:22:12] and abraham said if i've found favor
[1:22:15] in thy sight
[1:22:19] notice again it has to do with finding
[1:22:21] favor in the eyes of god
[1:22:23] finding grace in the eyes of god find
[1:22:25] favor in thy
[1:22:26] sight
[1:22:29] listen friends abraham had already found
[1:22:32] favor
[1:22:35] it shows that he had found favor because
[1:22:38] god
[1:22:38] came to him
[1:22:44] god came to him and then
[1:22:47] he said where's sarah your wife
[1:22:51] says he's in the tent behind you and he
[1:22:53] said
[1:22:55] i'm going to visit you about the time of
[1:22:57] life
[1:22:58] and sarah is going to have a son
[1:23:03] and the bible says that sarah heard it
[1:23:06] in the tent door behind him
[1:23:09] and said she laughed within
[1:23:12] herself in her heart now
[1:23:17] she laughed me an old woman
[1:23:21] my lord an old man and we're going to
[1:23:25] have a son
[1:23:30] and god they're
[1:23:34] eating bread drinking milk and eating a
[1:23:38] calf
[1:23:39] and butter and all these things and
[1:23:42] notice
[1:23:43] he said terry with me
[1:23:47] god and the angels waited there
[1:23:50] patiently
[1:23:52] how long does it take to dress out a
[1:23:53] calf
[1:23:55] takes a little bit of time then you got
[1:23:57] to cook that thing
[1:23:59] that takes some time you got to make
[1:24:01] those cakes and you got to bake them
[1:24:04] take some time
[1:24:08] god waited patiently
[1:24:15] hallelujah god waits patiently on
[1:24:18] us hallelujah
[1:24:25] and he said why did sarah laugh
[1:24:30] sarah denied it
[1:24:39] but friends what he did showed that
[1:24:42] abraham
[1:24:43] had favor with him he revealed the
[1:24:47] thoughts
[1:24:47] of sarah's heart
[1:24:52] and in our day in our
[1:24:56] age
[1:24:59] brother random stood on the platform and
[1:25:00] said if he's the same
[1:25:02] god that appeared to abraham
[1:25:06] and told the thoughts of sarah's heart
[1:25:09] that was behind his back in the doors of
[1:25:12] the tent then if he's the same god today
[1:25:14] he can do the same thing and brother
[1:25:16] branham turned his back to the audience
[1:25:19] and began to call people out tell them
[1:25:21] who they were
[1:25:22] and what they had an ailment with
[1:25:27] and then he turns around and said see
[1:25:29] he's the same god today
[1:25:33] what was it in the days
[1:25:38] when the son of man is being revealed
[1:25:43] and he revealed to abraham
[1:25:47] what he was going to do
[1:25:50] it shows that he had favor with god
[1:25:54] because god revealed himself to abraham
[1:25:58] he revealed what he was going to do to
[1:26:00] abraham
[1:26:02] god has come down and opened up your
[1:26:04] eyes
[1:26:06] in an age where people are spiritually
[1:26:08] blind
[1:26:10] and he's opened up your eyes and he's
[1:26:12] revealed this truth to you
[1:26:14] it shows that you have found favor with
[1:26:17] god
[1:26:18] it shows you are a favored people it
[1:26:21] shows you
[1:26:22] are a favored woman a bride to be to
[1:26:25] christ
[1:26:33] one man found favor with god brother
[1:26:35] branham said
[1:26:37] now i want you to notice that is the
[1:26:39] beginning of christianity of the church
[1:26:41] i want you to notice it wasn't because
[1:26:43] abraham was a good man
[1:26:45] it was because god elected and chose
[1:26:48] abraham
[1:26:50] it wasn't abraham choosing god it was
[1:26:53] god choosing abraham
[1:26:54] can you see it now as it was then so it
[1:26:58] is today
[1:26:59] it isn't you choosing god it's god
[1:27:02] choosing you
[1:27:06] if god has chosen you he chose you
[1:27:09] because you are have found favor in his
[1:27:13] sight
[1:27:17] and you didn't find favor because you
[1:27:19] were super religious
[1:27:21] you found favor because you were elect
[1:27:24] and that's why god called you and
[1:27:27] brother brahm said this might be very
[1:27:29] strong but i want you to notice
[1:27:31] immediately after election and choice
[1:27:35] it's separation from everything else as
[1:27:38] soon as he calls he elects and calls
[1:27:41] and then when he calls he separates from
[1:27:44] everything else as soon as he calls
[1:27:47] he separates you from everything that
[1:27:50] hangs on to you
[1:27:52] that proves it isn't a denomination it
[1:27:54] isn't two or three people together
[1:27:56] he expects every individual it's an
[1:27:59] individual affair with every person
[1:28:05] seek out your own salvation with fear
[1:28:07] and trembling
[1:28:13] you don't you don't get in because your
[1:28:15] mom and dad was good
[1:28:18] you don't get in because mom and dad
[1:28:20] loved you
[1:28:22] right you get in because
[1:28:26] god chose you it's an individual affair
[1:28:32] now that should be good news
[1:28:37] yes brother branham says
[1:28:40] that every baby if it dies
[1:28:44] goes to heaven is that right how many
[1:28:47] believes that
[1:28:48] right he said it could be born to the
[1:28:51] most
[1:28:52] wickedest two people in the town
[1:28:57] but if it dies as a baby it goes to
[1:28:59] heaven
[1:29:01] well i can tell you this people could be
[1:29:05] born to the two wickedest people on the
[1:29:07] face of the earth
[1:29:08] but that doesn't mean that they're not
[1:29:10] the elect of god and god can't call you
[1:29:16] you could be born to maybe the most
[1:29:19] religious
[1:29:22] person
[1:29:24] but it doesn't have anything to do with
[1:29:26] whether god's going to open your eyes or
[1:29:28] not
[1:29:34] you could be born to a denominational
[1:29:36] person you could be born to
[1:29:38] any kind of organization
[1:29:43] now i don't say that looking down on
[1:29:44] them
[1:29:47] they can only see what they can see
[1:29:55] i don't know how it all fits together
[1:29:56] but brother branham says god's got
[1:29:58] quarters and nickels and dimes and and
[1:30:01] pennies
[1:30:02] and he says don't throw them away they
[1:30:04] all make change
[1:30:06] he said they're all in god's economy you
[1:30:08] know i don't know how they fit
[1:30:09] but he said they do and so i just
[1:30:12] believe it
[1:30:14] but it doesn't matter what mom and daddy
[1:30:16] believe mom and daddy couldn't believe
[1:30:18] some dogma of something
[1:30:20] but it has nothing to do with god
[1:30:24] choosing you he chose you by election
[1:30:43] i was come to me about a brother
[1:30:47] i can't think of his name right now he's
[1:30:49] from south carolina
[1:30:53] but he
[1:30:57] he has a quite a testimony
[1:31:00] how his father killed his mother
[1:31:04] and he saw it happen
[1:31:07] and then he became
[1:31:11] on the streets became involved in gangs
[1:31:16] and became i believe kind of like an
[1:31:19] enforcer
[1:31:20] in a gang
[1:31:24] you come from a horrible horrible
[1:31:26] horrible experience
[1:31:28] and from a horrible life but one day god
[1:31:31] called him
[1:31:35] brother burley williams that's who i was
[1:31:36] thinking of
[1:31:39] and he passes the church and he's got
[1:31:43] quite a ministry for young people
[1:31:55] you ought to be thankful that god
[1:31:58] elected you
[1:32:00] you ought to be thankful that he called
[1:32:02] you
[1:32:05] amen amen brother brown said i
[1:32:09] thank god that i was elect
[1:32:15] i thank god he chose me i never chose
[1:32:17] him he chose me
[1:32:19] [Music]
[1:32:20] you never chose him he chose you
[1:32:23] no man can come to me except my father
[1:32:25] draws him first
[1:32:26] and all the fathers give me will come to
[1:32:29] me
[1:32:30] you see if god calls you he'll knock on
[1:32:32] your door
[1:32:34] and that's the time for you to come
[1:32:41] he doesn't knock on people's door all at
[1:32:43] the same chronological age
[1:32:47] different times different ages different
[1:32:49] seasons each one of you have your time
[1:32:51] in your
[1:32:52] your season for god to call on you
[1:32:56] some he calls young praise god
[1:33:01] i think god he calls some young and
[1:33:02] they'll never know the depths
[1:33:07] of the wicked vileness of this world
[1:33:16] i thank god my children
[1:33:21] never knew the wickedness that i got
[1:33:23] into
[1:33:25] and knew they never went down those
[1:33:28] paths
[1:33:30] and i thank god they didn't
[1:33:37] some he calls an older age
[1:33:42] he called one man at the age of 80.
[1:33:47] said you see that stick in your hand i
[1:33:50] want you to take it and i want you to go
[1:33:51] down to egypt and deliver my people
[1:33:55] [Applause]
[1:33:58] 80 year old man one-man army
[1:34:04] he wasn't going down there with his past
[1:34:06] knowledge of how to fight as a warrior
[1:34:10] he was going down there as a warrior for
[1:34:12] god
[1:34:13] he was going down there as a warrior for
[1:34:15] the i am
[1:34:19] hallelujah
[1:34:22] the thing you want brother brown says
[1:34:25] his favor with god

[1:34:29] calls you to do
[1:34:31] to shout scream cry ball anything
[1:34:34] it wants you to do anything the holy
[1:34:36] spirit puts on you
[1:34:37] you do it because you don't care you
[1:34:39] lost all that man-made stuff
[1:34:41] you're free in christ jesus the spirit
[1:34:43] of god has set you free
[1:34:45] and you're free in the power of god
[1:34:46] bathing in his beauty worshipping him in
[1:34:49] spirit and in truth
[1:34:50] you're a free person you took the word
[1:34:52] of god and it took a hold in your heart
[1:34:54] you don't care you're not ashamed you're
[1:34:56] not afraid
[1:34:59] hallelujah why because you found favor
[1:35:02] with god
[1:35:15] i like the story about the woman at the
[1:35:17] well
[1:35:21] one of the things i really like about it
[1:35:24] is that jesus said i have need to go to
[1:35:27] samaria
[1:35:29] amen hallelujah
[1:35:34] he had a need to go down there why
[1:35:36] because there was an elixir to god down
[1:35:39] there
[1:35:40] somebody that the father had chosen
[1:35:44] she was an adulterous woman she was an
[1:35:47] ill-famed woman
[1:35:48] she was one that other women looked down
[1:35:50] upon in the city
[1:35:52] she she was frowned upon she was you
[1:35:54] know they wanted to keep her
[1:35:56] away from their men
[1:36:01] she had to go to the well at a different
[1:36:03] time of the day
[1:36:05] and that was the time jesus chose to go
[1:36:08] oh hallelujah oh friends i'm so glad i'm
[1:36:12] saved
[1:36:13] hallelujah that's the time he chose to
[1:36:17] go
[1:36:18] and that's why he needed to go there and
[1:36:21] he said why
[1:36:22] is why his uh disciples went to go
[1:36:25] fetch some food to eat he went down
[1:36:29] to the well and this woman came and he
[1:36:32] said
[1:36:34] fetch me a drink of water
[1:36:38] and she said it's not customary for you
[1:36:41] jews to ask us samaritans you know the
[1:36:43] jews looked down with samaritans
[1:36:44] samaritan was half gentile half jew
[1:36:48] he looked down on us
[1:36:54] jesus didn't have a racial bone in his
[1:36:58] body
[1:37:04] jesus wasn't racial and neither are his
[1:37:07] people
[1:37:08] i don't know why that keeps coming up
[1:37:10] none of that's in my notes
[1:37:17] but he said if you knew who was talking
[1:37:20] to you
[1:37:21] amen you'd ask me for a drink see
[1:37:24] brother branham said
[1:37:28] god foresaw her amen
[1:37:35] oh hallelujah god foresaw you
[1:37:41] thank you father there is nothing you've
[1:37:43] done
[1:37:45] that ever surprised god
[1:37:49] tell you friends when i got that
[1:37:50] revelation it just
[1:37:53] did something to me amen brother branham
[1:37:55] said god
[1:37:56] chose moses he said you know he killed a
[1:37:58] man one time
[1:38:00] but god still chose him
[1:38:04] because that's who god had chosen he
[1:38:06] wasn't surprised by it
[1:38:08] right he wasn't surprised by anything
[1:38:10] that you've ever done
[1:38:12] he isn't he is surprised if you've
[1:38:15] backslidden
[1:38:17] if you've got cold on god he is not
[1:38:19] surprised
[1:38:21] he knew everything that was going to
[1:38:22] happen
[1:38:24] he allowed the things that happened that
[1:38:28] happened
[1:38:30] because there's nothing too great for
[1:38:32] him
[1:38:35] and he constantly reminds us of who he
[1:38:37] is
[1:38:38] and how great he is and of his love and
[1:38:41] his
[1:38:42] and his care and his mercy and his grace
[1:38:45] for us
[1:38:49] she was a predestinated seed
[1:38:53] that's why and friends she found grace
[1:38:58] in his eyes she found
[1:39:01] favor with him she couldn't find favor
[1:39:04] with nobody else in the town but she
[1:39:06] found favor with jesus
[1:39:11] hallelujah you found favor with him
[1:39:15] and he began to reveal his word to her
[1:39:18] she says our fathers
[1:39:20] say that your fathers say you worship in
[1:39:23] jerusalem are saying this mountains
[1:39:25] he said the time cometh and now is where
[1:39:27] you'll worship him in spirit and in
[1:39:29] truth
[1:39:31] he said go get your husband she said i
[1:39:34] have no husband
[1:39:35] he says you've spoken well for you've
[1:39:37] had five and the one you're with now is
[1:39:38] not your husband
[1:39:41] she said sir i perceive you're a prophet
[1:39:45] we know when the messiah comes that
[1:39:47] he'll do these things
[1:39:49] he said i'm he that speaks to you
[1:39:53] oh something quickened inside of her
[1:39:57] something came alive she recognized that
[1:40:00] he was the messiah that would have been
[1:40:02] promised
[1:40:07] the priest of the temple called him
[1:40:09] bells above yeah
[1:40:10] they said you cast out devils by the
[1:40:12] power of devils
[1:40:16] there was nothing in them that was a
[1:40:18] difference between her and them
[1:40:20] oh they could look and say the
[1:40:22] difference is she's an ill-famed woman
[1:40:24] and we're holy but the difference was
[1:40:28] there was a seed of god in her to be fit
[1:40:30] [Applause]
[1:40:33] she was a predestinated seed she was
[1:40:35] chosen of god
[1:40:36] she was elect
[1:40:41] god had foreseen her before the
[1:40:43] foundation of the world
[1:40:45] and he placed her name on the lamb's
[1:40:47] book of life before the foundation of
[1:40:49] the world
[1:40:52] your name didn't get placed on the
[1:40:55] land's book of life
[1:40:57] when you came and accepted salvation
[1:41:00] it was placed on the lamb's book of life
[1:41:02] before the foundation of the world
[1:41:07] hallelujah you didn't become seed by
[1:41:10] rebirth
[1:41:12] you were seed and therefore could be
[1:41:16] reborn
[1:41:19] said you weren't a pig or a or a dog
[1:41:22] and then became a sheep or an eagle said
[1:41:24] you always were
[1:41:25] a sheep
[1:41:32] only the elect can be reborn
[1:41:35] hallelujah praise the lord
[1:41:40] hallelujah
[1:41:44] we read in the bible in the first
[1:41:48] part of genesis about two boys
[1:41:52] i'm going to be closing we read about
[1:41:55] two boys
[1:41:59] cain and abel now brother branham says
[1:42:04] that their mommy and daddy taught them
[1:42:07] that it was fruit
[1:42:16] and so cain when brother brown said both
[1:42:20] boys wanted to find favor with god
[1:42:25] cain wanted favor with god
[1:42:29] so cain brought of
[1:42:32] everything that had been that he had
[1:42:35] yielded
[1:42:36] through his hard work in labor
[1:42:40] and made a beautiful altar made a
[1:42:43] beautiful sacrifice to god of
[1:42:45] everything that he had worked and toiled
[1:42:48] over
[1:42:52] and he comes up before god and he's
[1:42:54] waiting for god to come
[1:42:56] down and accept his offering
[1:43:00] and he looks over and he sees abel
[1:43:03] abel didn't he didn't
[1:43:07] build no altar like cain did he just put
[1:43:10] some rocks together
[1:43:12] and he brought a little innocent lamb
[1:43:14] over there
[1:43:15] and he took a rock and he bashed his
[1:43:18] brains out
[1:43:20] and he took a rock and he cut it and
[1:43:22] spilled its blood
[1:43:25] it was an awful looking mess
[1:43:30] and god came down and had
[1:43:33] honor unto
[1:43:36] abel's sacrifice
[1:43:40] but under cain's sacrifice
[1:43:43] god didn't have no honor
[1:43:49] abel found favor with god
[1:43:52] not because of his sacrifice
[1:43:57] abel found favor with god therefore was
[1:44:00] able to make the sacrifice
[1:44:05] see here's what i'm getting at the bible
[1:44:07] says
[1:44:08] by faith abel offered a more excellent
[1:44:12] sacrifice than that of king
[1:44:14] and brother branham said it was by
[1:44:16] revelation he said
[1:44:18] faith is a revelation and abel
[1:44:22] offered a more excellent sacrifice
[1:44:23] because god revealed to him
[1:44:26] it wasn't true
[1:44:29] he revealed to him that something had to
[1:44:32] die he revealed to him that it was blood
[1:44:35] that took him out of the garden
[1:44:38] he revealed to him that that something
[1:44:41] had to die in order for their nakedness
[1:44:44] to be covered
[1:44:49] that he had revelation of this
[1:44:53] shows that he found favor with god
[1:44:57] friends you didn't find favor with god
[1:45:00] because you come here to church
[1:45:02] you didn't find favor with god because
[1:45:04] you got real good or because you
[1:45:06] got dunked in some water and or
[1:45:09] something like that
[1:45:10] it wasn't because you got baptized it
[1:45:12] was because you belonged to him
[1:45:15] that's why you found favor with god you
[1:45:18] did all these things
[1:45:19] because you fight favor with god
[1:45:22] you did all these things because god
[1:45:24] revealed it to you
[1:45:26] it wasn't just being dumped in water it
[1:45:28] was going down in
[1:45:30] waters of baptism and and and
[1:45:33] and your sins being remitted from you
[1:45:37] [Music]
[1:45:41] hallelujah it was burying that old man
[1:45:46] and coming up a new creature in christ
[1:45:51] now there's people who don't have that
[1:45:52] revelation
[1:45:54] and they go down dry centers and come up
[1:45:56] wet ones
[1:45:58] nothing changed
[1:46:02] what changed you was god opening your
[1:46:05] eyes and revealing himself to you
[1:46:08] that shows that you have found grace
[1:46:12] in the eyes of the lord it shows
[1:46:15] that you have favor with god
[1:46:19] you could go out of these doors this
[1:46:21] morning
[1:46:22] there should be a joy in your heart
[1:46:24] knowing
[1:46:26] that you have favor with god
[1:46:30] hallelujah
[1:46:38] hallelujah
[1:46:41] it brings to me a whole
[1:46:45] new meaning to my grace to sufficiency
[1:46:50] amen my grace is sufficient for you he
[1:46:52] told paul
[1:46:54] paul said i've got a thorn in the flesh
[1:46:57] and i prayed three times that he would
[1:46:59] remove it from me
[1:47:01] but his answer to me was my grace is
[1:47:03] sufficient
[1:47:07] paul found grace in the eyes of the lord
[1:47:13] paul the bible says yet
[1:47:17] while he was breathing out threatenings
[1:47:19] on the church
[1:47:25] that god appeared to him
[1:47:29] in a pillar of light yes
[1:47:34] and paul recognized the supernatural
[1:47:38] and he said lord who are you
[1:47:43] he said i'm jesus whom thou persecuted
[1:47:49] it's hard to kick against the pricks
[1:47:55] you're coming to me
[1:48:00] paul was blinded by scales come over his
[1:48:04] eyes
[1:48:08] but jesus said i'm going to send a man
[1:48:10] to you
[1:48:11] amen and he's going to pray for you
[1:48:14] and the skills are going to come off
[1:48:15] your eyes and you're going to receive
[1:48:17] the holy ghost
[1:48:20] and then he went
[1:48:24] lord you want me to go down there to
[1:48:26] saul
[1:48:27] of tarsus he's the one that's been
[1:48:31] persecuting us
[1:48:34] well i've called him to do a great work
[1:48:36] for me
[1:48:39] yet while he was breathing out
[1:48:41] threatenings
[1:48:42] it didn't matter friends your past life
[1:48:46] don't matter
[1:48:48] hallelujah things that you've come from
[1:48:51] don't matter the times that you've lit
[1:48:55] candles and made offerings and
[1:48:57] and and all these different things none
[1:49:00] of those things

[2:00:41] [Music]
[2:00:53] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:00:57] amen praise the name of the lord
[2:01:00] amen you feel that way amen
[2:01:03] we are made out of the stuff that can't
[2:01:06] bluff
[2:01:07] amen it's a reality amen in our lives
[2:01:11] you know to me you you find one of the
[2:01:14] things
[2:01:14] that how the lord spoke to us today it's
[2:01:17] one of the things that that
[2:01:18] that satan fights so much
[2:01:22] on that of predestination
[2:01:25] there's a lot of things and and i'll
[2:01:27] just tell you there's not a lot that
[2:01:28] even believe it even how brother branham
[2:01:30] brought it
[2:01:31] but the reality of it is is that no
[2:01:34] sunday school
[2:01:34] no bible reading no parents no prophet
[2:01:38] no pastor put the seed of god in you
[2:01:41] he was always a seed of god
[2:01:46] amen just like that prodigal son when he
[2:01:49] he went his way but it did not change
[2:01:52] that he was a son
[2:01:53] he was always a son even when he had
[2:01:57] all types of stuff on him that nobody
[2:01:59] wanted to be around him
[2:02:01] he was still a son but the only way he
[2:02:03] could be recognized as a son
[2:02:06] is there would have to go a call out to
[2:02:08] him
[2:02:09] and the angel of the lord spoke to his
[2:02:11] heart and when he came in the presence
[2:02:13] of his father back into his homeland
[2:02:17] then that's when he can be recognized as
[2:02:18] a son and that's what the spirit of god
[2:02:21] first of all the spirit of god tells
[2:02:22] us we're sons and daughters of god it
[2:02:26] and you know it's just something about
[2:02:27] it that the spirit of god is
[2:02:29] he's not there to try to persuade us to
[2:02:31] convince us he speaks with an authority
[2:02:33] and it build there's a faith that rises
[2:02:35] within us that it's not
[2:02:36] us that's doing it it's the seed of god
[2:02:39] that's responding
[2:02:41] to the light of god and he's drawing us
[2:02:44] to him
[2:02:45] and into that place to where we can
[2:02:47] really be expressed
[2:02:48] who can take credit for anything i mean
[2:02:52] if if if the seed was put in you because
[2:02:54] when you read the bible then you've got
[2:02:55] something to do with it
[2:02:57] if it was put in you that well you know
[2:02:59] when when you came to the altar it came
[2:03:01] came in you that's not the scripture
[2:03:04] that's not the scripture at all
[2:03:06] but the reality is when you drop from
[2:03:09] your mother's womb
[2:03:10] that seed was in you then
[2:03:13] but the baby tells us in god rich and
[2:03:15] mercy when you took that breath of life
[2:03:17] right there it enters in amen
[2:03:20] and thanks be to god that he came
[2:03:23] looking for me
[2:03:25] amen i'll tell you what the word of god
[2:03:27] it it
[2:03:28] it dismantles all fear it dismantles
[2:03:30] every doubt it dismantles every question
[2:03:32] and it
[2:03:33] it removes the reality of is that what
[2:03:36] you were before in that first nature
[2:03:37] that's not who you really were
[2:03:40] that was a false image but the true
[2:03:42] image is now what's reflecting in your
[2:03:45] life
[2:03:45] what did that amazing grace amazing
[2:03:48] grace
[2:03:49] amen like mary when when the angel of
[2:03:51] the lord came to her
[2:03:53] and said thou art highly favored
[2:03:57] of god highly favored she was already
[2:04:00] blessed
[2:04:01] brother man tells us david was blessed
[2:04:03] before the anointing oil was ever paul
[2:04:05] poured upon him we were blessed
[2:04:09] amen aren't you glad why you couldn't
[2:04:10] fit into the world
[2:04:12] there's things you tried you tried you
[2:04:14] tried to fit in but there's just
[2:04:15] something about it
[2:04:16] you couldn't fit in because you're not
[2:04:18] of this world
[2:04:20] you never were of this world you were
[2:04:22] always
[2:04:23] a part of god amen
[2:04:26] i'm just so thankful for that aren't you
[2:04:28] amen how many just enjoyed the word of
[2:04:30] the lord this morning

[2:04:39] mercy and your grace

[2:04:50] you've got this in control

[2:05:50] just so move in their hearts even as
[2:05:52] they would rest lord in their pillow and
[2:05:54] and to recognize that there's a greater
[2:05:56] purpose lord in life than
