[25:07] special way
[25:09] take us Lord use us for your glory
[25:13] minister right there in their living
[25:15] rooms God or father you always come
[25:19] where you're invited Lord we just Lord
[25:22] want to just commit this service Lord
[25:24] now into your hands we ask it for your
[25:27] glory in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[25:32] god bless you this morning we want to
[25:34] turn right to the word of the Lord I
[25:36] want to go right to first Thessalonians
[25:38] chapter five this morning and we
[25:42] certainly want to greet each and every
[25:44] one of you in the precious name of the
[25:46] Lord Jesus and just just looking and
[25:52] expecting amen for great things that the
[25:57] Lord is going to do and we just want to
[26:04] begin reading here in the scripture in
[26:07] verse 1 of first Thessalonians 5 but of
[26:12] the times and the seasons brethren you
[26:16] have no need that I write unto you
[26:21] for yourselves know perfectly that the
[26:24] day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in
[26:29] the night for when they shall say peace
[26:33] and safety then sudden destruction
[26:37] cometh upon them as a has travail upon a
[26:42] woman with child and they shall not
[26:44] escape but ye brethren are not in
[26:48] darkness that that day should overtake
[26:52] you as a thief ye are all the children
[26:56] of light and the children of the day we
[27:01] are not of the night nor of darkness
[27:06] therefore let us not sleep as others as
[27:11] do others but let us watch and be sober
[27:18] that word term that would be used in the
[27:21] scripture sober it deals with one who is
[27:24] calm and collected in their mind for
[27:28] they that sleep sleep in the night and
[27:31] they that be drunken are drunken in the
[27:36] night so we see how Paul's bringing this
[27:39] this here of day and night those that
[27:44] are asleep those are awake and to
[27:46] recognize that there is a darkness it is
[27:49] a nighttime upon the earth as far as
[27:54] civilization you can look out your
[27:56] window we can look at it here and know
[27:57] that as far as in this physical day we
[28:00] see daylight but yet in the spiritual
[28:03] context of the setting of God's word
[28:06] it's night and that of the world itself
[28:10] is darkness where we are in the the time
[28:14] of night and it's ready for the breaking
[28:17] of the day that breaking of the day one
[28:21] who has Herald it be on coming of the
[28:24] morning star there's already been an
[28:27] announcement go out
[28:29] chalo
[28:30] we recognize that where we are so to be
[28:33] of the day is where that light the light
[28:37] that lighteth every man we have been
[28:38] born of that light the Holy Ghost as
[28:42] they have light in Goshen so we have
[28:45] light in our vessels the very the very
[28:49] first part of the scripture of the text
[28:52] for the rapture Psalms 27 1 the Lord is
[28:55] the light of my life so we have light
[28:59] there's an understanding there's life
[29:01] that has come to us so we are not
[29:04] sleeping
[29:05] groping wandering or even under a false
[29:08] expectation our expectation is of the
[29:12] Lord so Paul is saying here that for our
[29:16] lives let us watch and be sober we've
[29:19] been directed on what we are to be
[29:22] watching and expect enough so notice how
[29:25] he goes on in verse 8 but let us who are
[29:28] of the day be sober once again putting
[29:33] on the breastplate of faith and love and
[29:38] for an helmet the hope of salvation for
[29:44] God hath not appointed us to wrath but
[29:49] to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus
[29:53] Christ who died for us that whether we
[29:57] wake or sleep we should live together
[30:01] with him so we want to look here in the
[30:05] scriptures for and take this thought
[30:09] this morning for an helmet the hope of
[30:12] salvation so may the Lord bless you as
[30:15] we are is through the reading of the
[30:17] word and as you're being seated and you
[30:19] were there in your homes but I just you
[30:23] notice and here with a local assembly we
[30:25] took a little bit of a just under the
[30:28] Lord's leading just a little bit of a
[30:30] break there from when we spoke in the
[30:31] first part of March we've been dealing
[30:33] with the thought the crowning of our
[30:35] life and how that we were admonished as
[30:39] brother Branham would tell us in the
[30:41] Philadelphian age he said Jesus come
[30:44] in this in that particular quote he said
[30:46] Jesus comes in the time of trouble and
[30:48] that's when he comes and he's talking
[30:51] about the coming of the Lord because in
[30:53] the Philadelphian age they were
[30:55] admonished the admonishment of the
[30:57] Spirit is hold fast to that that which
[31:00] thou hast behold I come quickly and so
[31:03] when we consider the coming of the Lord
[31:06] remember in the in the in the minds of
[31:09] man man looks at the coming of the Lord
[31:11] and the Holy Spirit picks it up through
[31:14] Peter and says that that mind mind frame
[31:18] or that mindset of the carnal man
[31:20] looking at the at the scripture he looks
[31:24] at it in a manner it says all things are
[31:26] as they were such from the beginning see
[31:29] they don't recognize those things that
[31:32] are actually being done it doesn't mean
[31:34] that they don't know what's going on
[31:36] what's being reported this virus or this
[31:38] earthquake there it doesn't mean that
[31:40] they don't read those things but to
[31:42] recognize that for you and I it's not
[31:44] that we have to have everything put
[31:46] together and this is this but we know
[31:48] that every event like we looked at on
[31:51] Thursday God is at work and everything
[31:54] is setting the scene and God is moving
[31:57] right in the midst of his children even
[32:00] as we see this where the scripture said
[32:02] there would be earthquakes in divers
[32:04] places and we see that taking place
[32:07] we've seen that and see these are things
[32:10] that even as you look over time as we
[32:13] said the service as a goal the word old
[32:17] the carnal becomes even further hardened
[32:20] because you come through this ah nothing
[32:22] really took place and they keep moving
[32:24] along ah nothing took place it's just
[32:27] like through the nation here 9/11
[32:30] happened everybody goes to church
[32:32] everybody starts praying and you know
[32:34] but then after a period of time after
[32:36] that event fades and that fades from the
[32:39] mind of the people they go back and
[32:41] resume life is normal but for the bride
[32:44] of Jesus Christ if not for God's grace
[32:47] you are i we would be even in the same
[32:50] commission we would be even looking for
[32:53] many of the expectations that the
[32:54] ecumenical
[32:55] world is looking for they're looking for
[32:58] a revival but God has delivered the
[33:01] revival but the revival is not something
[33:04] of a gathering so much of people it's a
[33:07] revival of God's Word the Living God in
[33:10] the hearts of his children and so we
[33:14] know that we are by his grace in that
[33:17] moment and so these are things that for
[33:20] in our lives we are thankful to God for
[33:23] the unction of the Holy Spirit to know
[33:25] God is working all of these things are
[33:28] setting the stage it's just like when
[33:31] you go to a drama you watch a play
[33:33] that's on the stage and when you look at
[33:37] that state when you look at the play
[33:39] that's on the stage they have different
[33:41] props that are set up on the stage and
[33:44] they have it so if they're supposed to
[33:46] be in a tropical setting they'll have
[33:49] maybe fake palm trees or palm trees they
[33:51] drew and they'll have things that look
[33:53] like sand they're trying to get a
[33:55] background or a picture the setting
[33:58] established of where it's taking place
[34:00] and so we recognize that within the
[34:04] setting of the coming of the Lord it
[34:06] indeed is in the time of trouble we
[34:09] recognize brother Brennan would tell us
[34:11] like this I believe it in the message
[34:12] Jubilee year brother Bram said sin is
[34:15] going to continue to get worse and worse
[34:17] and worse he said do not expect it to
[34:20] get any better and so our expectation
[34:24] that's what we really want to hone in
[34:26] and deal with here this morning in this
[34:28] thought of the coming of the Lord
[34:30] because the Prophet had admonished us by
[34:33] the Spirit of God in the Philadelphia
[34:35] church age there when he took of that
[34:37] that scripture hold fast behold I come
[34:40] quickly and he expressed that and
[34:43] remember as we looked at it he spoke of
[34:46] that in time and of how he says take
[34:51] unto you the full armor of God and he
[34:53] says use every weapon that God has given
[34:58] you he said use every gift that God has
[35:02] given to the body so all of this God has
[35:06] provided all
[35:08] that we have meet up and I want to draw
[35:10] your attention here because in this
[35:13] scripture in 1st Thessalonians 5 a how
[35:16] when we reach back and we were speaking
[35:18] of this back in the first part of mark
[35:20] you recognize when the promise of the
[35:24] Messiah was to come remember that was
[35:27] the the Keystone the capping off of the
[35:29] Old Testament when he came Isaiah
[35:32] describes his coming as that of the
[35:35] helmet of salvation he was adorned with
[35:37] and he had for a breastplate
[35:40] righteousness as a breastplate now we
[35:42] know that we're to be clothed with the
[35:44] full armor of God but the Spirit of God
[35:47] through Paul who also wrote in Ephesians
[35:50] 6 of the armor of God wrote here and
[35:53] said that because of here the darkness
[35:57] and the night and how than in our lives
[35:59] we are to conduct ourselves we are
[36:01] admonished be sober and put on the
[36:05] breastplate of faith and love because
[36:07] remember faith and love are they go
[36:11] their kinfolks they go together and
[36:13] having on the breastplate is from within
[36:16] the heart doing what is right and that
[36:20] isn't just doing well you know the word
[36:23] says this but it's wanting to have the
[36:25] right attitude motive and objective
[36:28] behind all these things asking that God
[36:30] that everything would be in line with
[36:32] his mind so we look here the other part
[36:37] of it which we're dealing with this
[36:39] morning for an helmet the hope of
[36:42] salvation we understand that the whole
[36:44] armor of God is supernatural
[36:46] but notice how it spoke here for an
[36:50] helmet this is what you did take for the
[36:53] protective gear and brother branham
[36:56] would draft us into the greatest valuer
[36:59] fought and says notice this is the
[37:01] covering of the head it's the mind
[37:03] it's where decisions are made the
[37:06] covering of the helmet this is the
[37:08] battleground area so we're to have on
[37:11] foreign helmet use foreign helmet the
[37:15] hope of salvation and hear the word hope
[37:18] that is
[37:19] used here is that word which means to
[37:22] anticipate with a great deal of pleasure
[37:25] it's an expectation of good ah with
[37:29] joyful confidence and you notice it goes
[37:33] on with that of the hope the the earnest
[37:37] the expectation of salvation
[37:40] now this salvation we're not talking
[37:43] about well you know Lord I need you to
[37:46] say my soul he's already done that if he
[37:49] had if that reality hasn't come into
[37:51] your heart you can receive that this
[37:53] morning because even as he deals with
[37:56] your life remember he has to deal with
[37:59] your heart you can't get anything with
[38:00] God from God until you first believe
[38:03] that he is and that he is a rewarder of
[38:05] them that diligently seek Him so it
[38:07] takes God even dealing with the heart
[38:09] for you to even have an expectation to
[38:11] say Lord the Holy Ghost belongs to me so
[38:14] Lord I'm asking that you would fill me
[38:16] with the Holy Ghost you have to
[38:18] recognize the promises that belong to
[38:21] you before you can never have an
[38:23] expectation on the God who made the
[38:25] promise to come and fulfill it so then
[38:27] we look at this term of that of the
[38:30] expectation of salvation and this word
[38:33] used here in the scripture it deals with
[38:36] deliverance it deals with preservation
[38:39] safety deliverance from the molestation
[38:42] of enemies it deals with health it deals
[38:46] with a present possession that belongs
[38:49] to every Christian it deals with all of
[38:52] the benefits and the blessings that
[38:54] belong to us now and those that we are
[38:57] to come in to either as we go by the way
[39:01] of the grave or by that of rapture we
[39:04] have a sure promise because he have not
[39:07] appointed us to wrath
[39:09] we are not going through the tribulation
[39:11] we have already passed from death unto
[39:14] life the blood has already come to
[39:17] execute judgment upon the oppression of
[39:20] their own nature and has lifted and
[39:23] separated by the cleansing foe and
[39:25] imparted his life we have a token and of
[39:29] assurance that we are not appointed unto
[39:32] wrath we are to obtain salvation from
[39:36] the Lord the rapture belongs to us as
[39:40] believers because he the scripture goes
[39:43] on to say he made that way he died for
[39:46] us he made the way for you and I so that
[39:50] you and I we don't have to go to hell we
[39:53] don't have to pay for our sins we do not
[39:55] have to be parted from his presence as a
[39:58] matter of fact he has made a way that
[40:01] where I am there you may be also
[40:04] he made that way so our expectation is
[40:07] is that the Lord as I am in him and he
[40:11] is in me there is a union that has taken
[40:14] place that has given me a divine
[40:16] assurance I shall never be left alone
[40:19] having never alone let me just tell you
[40:22] this morning even when you feel alone
[40:24] you are not alone for the Lord is right
[40:27] there with you
[40:31] well glory be to God we are saved as I
[40:36] think like her you know one of the men
[40:38] that brother Branham would refer to I
[40:40] love this how aww pink who wrote the
[40:42] sovereignty of God he would write it in
[40:45] this way he said it is the fourfold
[40:47] salvation we are saved from the penalty
[40:49] power presence and pleasure of sin oh my
[40:54] we that is the salvation of the Lord and
[40:56] the salvation of the Lord is sure now I
[40:59] want to just like you know I'm just
[41:02] looking at this you know and sometimes
[41:05] there's things that kind of you know I
[41:07] are moving in our hearts and then the
[41:12] Holy Spirit just kind of you know picks
[41:13] it up and and we bring it forth but to
[41:16] think you know within this our lives
[41:19] brother Branham over and over you find
[41:23] when he's talking about the helmet of
[41:26] salvation he will speak of it in this
[41:29] term there's a few places where he'll
[41:31] actually kind of deal with it in the
[41:33] battle but this in this time he will
[41:35] find where he'll go on to say oh he says
[41:38] when I come to that morning when I come
[41:41] to that day
[41:42] when I would stand on the other side he
[41:44] said when he says I come to that moment
[41:46] and he said of my crossing he said I'm
[41:49] gonna take off the helmet of salvation
[41:50] he said I'm gonna undo the sandals upon
[41:54] my feet I said I'm gonna take the sword
[41:56] and I'm gonna put it back inside of the
[42:00] sheath and look what and this is what he
[42:02] says I didn't include him but it'll be
[42:03] in the notes that will get sent out he
[42:05] says when that takes place he says I
[42:08] know as I go through the valley of the
[42:11] shadow of death the morning star will
[42:14] come out to light the lane because
[42:17] remember he remember as David said in
[42:20] Psalms 23 he said yea though I walk
[42:22] through the valley of the shadow you
[42:25] can't have a shadow without light yea
[42:27] though I walk through the valley of the
[42:28] shadow of death I will fear no evil for
[42:33] thou art with me so we notice notice the
[42:37] the expectation is in that moment I know
[42:40] that he will be there I know the Holy
[42:44] Ghost will spread its wings and carry me
[42:46] across that terrible muddy Jordan I
[42:49] don't worry he's said in another place
[42:51] he will be there he will be waiting Oh
[42:56] glory he said he'll be waiting if you'll
[42:59] just trust in him don't worry he says I
[43:02] know he will be there why because that's
[43:07] the expectation so then as we realized
[43:11] that we would as until the time of our
[43:14] departure whether we go by the way of
[43:16] the grave our body change we must keep
[43:19] on this helmet as a matter of fact we're
[43:22] honest by the Spirit of God right here
[43:23] as Paul would make it as it's in
[43:26] Ephesians 6 and then picking it up here
[43:28] it is an absolute necessity all the
[43:31] armour of God is but within this how the
[43:33] Holy Spirit would highlight this in
[43:35] terms of where we are living in this day
[43:38] in the coming of the Lord for in helmet
[43:40] take for and helmet a protection over
[43:43] your head be expectation of deliverance
[43:47] so until that time where we receive the
[43:51] deliverance where we receive the
[43:53] redemption of body whether
[43:55] we go by the way of the grave or whether
[43:57] we go in that of the rapture in the
[43:59] meantime we need our helmet on and we
[44:02] need the sword in our hands we need the
[44:04] breastplate of faith and love expecting
[44:07] listen to me now expecting deliverance
[44:11] in every situation with faith and love
[44:15] because we are people of deliverance so
[44:20] we need true expectation now when you
[44:23] look in the scripture here that we read
[44:25] it takes for a helmet the hope of
[44:27] salvation the breastplate of that of
[44:30] faith and charity remember all three of
[44:34] these work together brother Branham
[44:35] would call these as it's mentioned in
[44:37] first Corinthians 13:13 and now abideth
[44:40] faith hope and charity these three but
[44:44] the greatest of these is charity we
[44:46] realize you can have faith you can have
[44:48] hope but if you don't have charity
[44:50] remember though you have faith to move
[44:52] mountains it is nothing
[44:54] and as brother Branham would tell us he
[44:56] said somebody can have such burly faith
[44:58] to where things will actually move on
[45:01] their behalf but he said if they don't
[45:03] have kindness or charity they will
[45:06] actually ruin their influence so he said
[45:09] these are three things brother man would
[45:11] take us to mount Transfiguration and
[45:13] mount Transfiguration remember is the
[45:16] very speaks even of the coming of the
[45:18] Lord where even we're in this right here
[45:20] where Christ himself
[45:22] right there the adoption of the son
[45:24] remember we are living in the adoption
[45:26] time of sons and daughters of God the
[45:29] same word that speaks of the groom
[45:31] speaks of the blind so to think of it in
[45:34] the very adoption and the adornment
[45:36] there because the voice of God is in the
[45:38] bride and to think of this right now it
[45:41] is Christ Himself that is there he is
[45:43] veiled in the midst of his bride and he
[45:45] is the one speaking through her is that
[45:48] right and what is present for that
[45:50] revelation for this adoption it is faith
[45:53] hope and charity that accompanies it the
[45:56] same way it did on Mount Transfiguration
[45:59] nor glory be to God
[46:00] this is coming together because right
[46:02] off of that mountain it moves right down
[46:05] to the revealing of the
[46:07] 44,000 and out into the millennium and
[46:09] in the future home so this faith hope
[46:11] and charity the Prophet would place it
[46:14] like this he would tell us these are the
[46:16] sufficient elements he would tell us
[46:18] these are the greatest things he would
[46:21] say these are the sufficient elements
[46:24] that are needed for the church and he
[46:26] said when the church has these three
[46:28] things
[46:29] there's not one problem he said that can
[46:32] stand before the church there's not one
[46:34] problem he said that they will be seen
[46:37] through why faith hope and charity
[46:39] because remember in order to have faith
[46:42] faith is a revelation is that right but
[46:46] you don't get a revelation without love
[46:47] so it first must be love must be the
[46:50] governing like it must be the governing
[46:52] of our lives it must govern our actions
[46:55] as believers we love Him because He
[46:57] first loved us that has become real
[46:59] within our hearts so now that love
[47:01] that's residing within our life what
[47:03] does love do love love itself when it
[47:06] comes to such a degree it moves into
[47:09] that place to where it is produces a
[47:11] perfect faith a complete trust a
[47:13] complete confidence in the Lord because
[47:16] faith holds within it is the revelation
[47:19] of the will of God
[47:19] and once God's will is revealed then you
[47:23] and I then have a real true hope we have
[47:26] a true expectation not something we've
[47:29] made up not something we've wanted to
[47:31] happen a way we wanted it to happen Lord
[47:33] I want you to do it this way no we are
[47:35] looking to the Lord and we are waiting
[47:38] on his divine inspiration remember as we
[47:41] said last week if even if God Himself
[47:43] does not speak and give us per se so you
[47:47] know your wife will be out of the
[47:49] hospital in two days and she'll send in
[47:51] a living room God can do that he still
[47:53] does that but if he doesn't speak in
[47:56] that way we still have a sure word of
[47:59] prophecy for he said the prayer of faith
[48:02] shall save the sick and God shall raise
[48:04] him up he said lay hands on the sick and
[48:06] they shall recover he said I bless your
[48:08] bread and water and I'll take sickness
[48:10] from among you and the Lord that he
[48:12] loved all banned diseases we have
[48:14] promise after promise after promise that
[48:18] sure and we can stand there and say lord
[48:21] I don't know how you're gonna do it but
[48:22] I'm standing right here on your word
[48:24] what is that that is for an helmet the
[48:28] hope of salvation Oh glory be to God in
[48:32] the highest so we need these three to
[48:35] move together because hope hope by
[48:38] itself will never do hope by itself is
[48:42] just hoping but it puts something way
[48:44] out in advance but faith says it's now
[48:47] but faith brother bran would tell us
[48:49] faith what a beautiful thing
[48:51] it's timid faith is is timid it's
[48:53] something that is delicate and how that
[48:55] God would so write this in here on faith
[48:57] hope and charity now let's look here in
[49:00] the scriptures a little bit this morning
[49:02] in this hope that you and I are to have
[49:04] and find within it that it is a part of
[49:07] the DNA the stock of believers down
[49:09] through time that have had this
[49:11] revelation on their heart Paul would
[49:13] write in Revelations 15 or Romans 15:4
[49:16] sorry whatsoever things were written
[49:18] aforetime were written for our learning
[49:22] that we through patience and comfort of
[49:27] the Scriptures might have hope I believe
[49:33] that and I'm a witness of that aren't
[49:34] you how many times that where the Lord
[49:37] has spoke to us through his word and God
[49:39] will minister right through his word not
[49:40] just when we're Church but even when you
[49:43] might be reading in your devotional time
[49:44] it can even be when you're walking along
[49:47] your knee you you've already read and
[49:49] hear the things that you're meditating
[49:51] on and all of a sudden here God will
[49:53] bring something right through the word
[49:54] that will absolutely address what is it
[49:57] it's the Living God he is just unfolding
[50:00] of his word and ministering to our
[50:02] situation why that we might have hope
[50:06] Romans 15:13 now the god of Hope fill
[50:11] you with all joy and peace in believing
[50:15] this is what real hope does the god of
[50:19] hope not man-made hope but the god of
[50:21] Hope fill you with all joy and peace in
[50:25] believing that you may abound in Hope
[50:29] through the power
[50:30] of the Holy Ghost so in other words our
[50:33] expectation becomes greater and greater
[50:36] the closer the longer we serve the Lord
[50:39] our expectation ought to be growing
[50:41] greater in our lives it should not be
[50:44] diminished it ought to be growing
[50:46] greater well then how can that be but by
[50:48] the God of hope that he will fill us
[50:51] with joy and peace in believing that we
[50:54] might abound in hope but remember you
[50:56] can't have hope without faith and faith
[50:59] cometh by hearing and hearing by the
[51:01] Word of God this is why that Jude would
[51:04] say building up yourselves on your most
[51:07] holy faith you have got to feed your
[51:10] experience you've got to feed your wall
[51:12] if you let your walk go down if you let
[51:15] your personal life go down your hope
[51:17] starts shrinking brother remember the
[51:20] god of Hope not your home not my home
[51:23] I'm not talking about something well I
[51:25] hope I get healed I hope that's not the
[51:27] kind of hope I'm talking about yes sir
[51:29] this kind of a hope says by His stripes
[51:32] I am already healed let the credit come
[51:38] around and say hey you want so and so
[51:40] claiming that and they died yeah they
[51:43] did but remember they got healed they
[51:46] just didn't get the healing in this
[51:48] dimension they got the healing in the
[51:50] other dimension hallelujah so the
[51:54] bounding of our hope so the parts of the
[51:57] abounding of our hope let's look at this
[51:59] just for a moment because remember we
[52:01] need this helmet of salvation
[52:03] throughout our walk with God and the
[52:05] abounding of Hope yes feeding on the
[52:07] word our personal experience with God we
[52:09] need to be drawing upon that now let's
[52:11] look at how that our hope would actually
[52:13] continue to abound to actually grow
[52:17] greater and greater verse 1 of Romans 5
[52:23] therefore being justified by faith we
[52:26] have peace with God through our Lord
[52:28] Jesus Christ by whom also we have access
[52:31] by faith into this grace wherein we
[52:37] stand and rejoice in hope of the glory
[52:41] of God
[52:43] now notice what Paul is saying here our
[52:45] rejoicing is in hope of the glory of God
[52:49] not in press and circumstances so much
[52:52] but it's rejoicing in an expectation we
[52:56] know where we are going we know in whom
[52:59] we have believed and we believe he is
[53:01] able
[53:01] so notice rejoice in hope of the glory
[53:04] of God and not only so but we glory in
[53:08] tribulations also knowing that
[53:11] tribulation worketh patience and
[53:16] patience experience and experience hope
[53:23] you mean brother Simon I just can't get
[53:25] on a mailing list and they just mail me
[53:27] more hope nope this is how hope abounds
[53:31] hope in order for hope to abound then
[53:34] there must be situations that would
[53:36] actually come about through tribulation
[53:39] patience itself would stand there and
[53:41] when you don't have an answer whatsoever
[53:43] but you're standing there and saying but
[53:45] God has given a word and I'm one of his
[53:47] children who are you housing on the door
[53:49] I don't know how it's gonna do it it's
[53:51] up to him how he chooses to fulfill his
[53:53] word I just want to have my heart and my
[53:55] eyes ready I want to have the
[53:57] breastplate of faith and hope I want to
[54:00] have that of that of the helmet of
[54:01] salvation on I want to be expecting God
[54:04] to come and fulfill his word Oh glory
[54:09] many times the reason we get
[54:11] disappointed is because we create
[54:13] expectations for God but remember those
[54:16] who have done that have always missed
[54:18] him the way that he comes now I'm not
[54:20] just talking about for John the Baptist
[54:22] I'm not just talking about the Messiah
[54:24] I'm talking about the way that he comes
[54:26] to our life on an individual basis there
[54:28] might be things that can be taken place
[54:30] in you're alive and you're praying about
[54:32] it brother BAM says when we pray he said
[54:34] you know he says weak to ourselves can
[54:37] make an idol out of God because we pray
[54:40] and we want it to happen in a certain
[54:42] way and because God doesn't answer that
[54:45] way though he answered he said he said
[54:47] but yet because he don't answer that way
[54:49] we will say he didn't answer he said but
[54:53] God is
[54:54] an idol man it's not up at door around
[54:59] God said I packed you around
[55:02] Alleluia remember he is not an idol but
[55:05] you remember we are his idols but we are
[55:09] not idols that he'll are dumb or as I
[55:11] can't see but we have been anointed our
[55:14] ears have been opened eyes have been
[55:16] anointed we are living images of the
[55:19] Living God well notice and rejoice verse
[55:23] has this goes on here and verse 5 and
[55:25] hope maketh not ashamed
[55:29] so how experienced how does hope how
[55:32] does hope continue - about tribulations
[55:34] been whose patience patience is that
[55:37] it's waiting on the word this is what
[55:39] God has promised I don't know how it's
[55:42] going to come but I know God so in the
[55:43] midst of it it is an experience when God
[55:46] has brought you through tribulation it
[55:48] is a personal experience through the
[55:52] midst of that time to wear that now Hulk
[55:54] can abound in your life the tests and
[55:57] trials are all part of the shaping and
[55:59] molding and making of our lives this is
[56:01] why Paul would go on and say hope maketh
[56:03] not ashamed because the love of God is
[56:07] shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy
[56:10] Ghost which is given of us so in other
[56:13] words we're not ashamed in when we come
[56:15] to it
[56:16] our hope it's not a hope that we have
[56:18] made it is not a hope but well I think
[56:20] it's gonna happen this way or or this is
[56:22] going to take place no when we go
[56:24] according to our own hope we end up a
[56:26] shame
[56:27] but let me tell you something when we
[56:29] have hoped through the word from God we
[56:31] are never ashamed as we're looking to
[56:34] the Lord because this type of this this
[56:37] type of a part that's based right here
[56:39] it is not something that is contrived of
[56:41] our own doing but rather it is the love
[56:44] of God notice we are hope it maketh us
[56:46] not ashamed why because the love of God
[56:49] is shed abroad in our hearts what does
[56:51] love produce the love produces faith
[56:53] it's a complete trust in him it's not
[56:58] trying to tell him how to do it
[57:00] how are you ought to do it it is not for
[57:02] us to try to instruct the Lord it's for
[57:04] us to let our
[57:05] mine be getting taken out of the way and
[57:07] let the mind of Christ step down on the
[57:10] inside so here we notice a many times
[57:14] it's our own thinking because God he is
[57:17] always faithful
[57:19] notice how David would write of this in
[57:21] psalm 62:5 my soul wait thou only upon
[57:27] God for my expectation is from him so in
[57:34] other words David is saying the
[57:36] expectation that I have in my life for
[57:39] the Lord it has come from him he has
[57:42] delivered to me in my life which has
[57:45] brought an expectation those of you that
[57:47] know this this is this right here this
[57:49] scripture is part of the text for the
[57:51] message to Lord it is part of that
[57:54] particular text that my soul weight only
[57:56] upon God it's not looking for who has
[57:59] the cutting edge the how does this
[58:01] person say in this or whose another it's
[58:03] not about that we are looking to the
[58:06] Lord for my expectation is from him
[58:11] notice David goes on and says Psalms 119
[58:14] 114 thou art my hiding place and my
[58:19] shield I hope in thy word now watch this
[58:23] part here has neighborhood right here in
[58:25] verse 16 he would ask the Lord we're
[58:28] talking about that we would have bad
[58:30] that our hope maketh not ashamed
[58:32] remember David said uphold me according
[58:35] unto that word app hope means give me
[58:37] and endow me with the strength Lord that
[58:40] is according to thy word to know that
[58:42] within every word to be fulfilled it is
[58:46] to be God come on the scene and it's God
[58:49] to fulfill that word prove it through
[58:51] our lives so David is asking Lord uphold
[58:54] me strengthen me according unto that
[58:56] word that I may live and let me not be
[59:00] ashamed of my hope so David here is
[59:04] unlocking that is the expectation David
[59:07] how is this going to come out I don't
[59:09] know exactly how it's going to come out
[59:11] but I know the Lord is with us just like
[59:14] when David was waiting on the Lord and
[59:15] wanted to know if God wanted him to
[59:17] pursue
[59:18] to the enemy remember as David was
[59:20] waiting he looked to the Lord and God
[59:23] answered him and David was able to go
[59:26] with faith expecting complete victory
[59:29] from the Lord is that right
[59:31] so notice to not be ashamed of my hope
[59:34] because remember our hope is not
[59:36] according to our thinking we have been
[59:38] taken the word and fashioning according
[59:40] to our thinking or this is going to be
[59:42] the outcome and this is going to be the
[59:44] way remember Bill Graham told us this
[59:45] over and over people he said have charts
[59:48] he said they've got this man's Elisha
[59:49] and this one and this one and this one
[59:51] they have all those types of things
[59:53] there is a certain part about it and
[59:55] sometimes it's just in human nature the
[59:57] way that people are made up some people
[59:59] themselves say if I'd say like this they
[1:00:01] are prone to conspiracy they think
[1:00:04] everything is a conspiracy of the
[1:00:06] government or this or that that is not
[1:00:08] what the message is about as a matter of
[1:00:10] fact the message is the direct opposite
[1:00:12] of any conspiracy I'm telling you it's
[1:00:15] the same spirit upon conspiracy theory
[1:00:17] is the same devil that has led a lot of
[1:00:20] people right away from this message
[1:00:21] because they begin to doubt things that
[1:00:24] are set right in front of them we're not
[1:00:26] to be caught up with that spirit of
[1:00:28] conspiracy we are to be caught up with
[1:00:31] the Spirit of Almighty God because there
[1:00:34] is no faith or no substance in the
[1:00:37] spirit of conspiracy oh but we can hope
[1:00:41] in the truth of the Lord and that we
[1:00:44] will not be ashamed is that right oh I'm
[1:00:48] glad aren't you I'm glad we don't have a
[1:00:50] big ol bowl of kool-aid up here and
[1:00:52] everybody's gonna drink it let's all
[1:00:54] hold hands and die together I'm glad
[1:00:56] that we're not drinking out of kool-aid
[1:00:57] brother I'm glad that we have been
[1:00:59] invited to the washing of water by the
[1:01:01] word where we can actually be cleansed
[1:01:04] and separated even in our thoughts and
[1:01:06] our thinking I'm feeling uh not only
[1:01:08] ourselves watch but every bit of our
[1:01:11] lives washed OH
[1:01:13] Psalms 119 49 remember the word unto thy
[1:01:20] servant notice remember the word Lord
[1:01:25] what you spoke to me your servant
[1:01:30] oh and look how David puts himself under
[1:01:32] the word I'm your servant Lord upon
[1:01:36] which thou has caused me to hope how
[1:01:41] many people could be reading even in
[1:01:44] that of let's say 1st Thessalonians 4
[1:01:46] 1st Corinthians 15 2nd Peter chapter 2
[1:01:49] how many could be reading that even this
[1:01:52] morning and yet reading it and even
[1:01:54] those that would be around and saying
[1:01:56] hold the rapture we're looking for the
[1:01:58] rapture of the church listen friends if
[1:02:00] not for the mercy of God you and I would
[1:02:03] not be resting on this rock in the right
[1:02:06] way it has been God fulfilling and
[1:02:09] keeping his word that the promise of the
[1:02:12] rapture has been unfolded through the
[1:02:15] message of the hour in this time we are
[1:02:18] not resting on the tradition of a manner
[1:02:21] we have been founded upon that which has
[1:02:24] caused me to hope it is the Lord that
[1:02:27] has released inspiration for me now it's
[1:02:32] my head lifted up above mine enemies
[1:02:34] thou has hid me in the secret of the
[1:02:37] tabernacle in that pavilion
[1:02:39] and you have set me upon a rock we have
[1:02:43] a sure foundation glory be to God that's
[1:02:47] why this message to you and I when we
[1:02:49] receive it in the right way it is the
[1:02:52] revelation of Jesus Christ to our lives
[1:02:55] personally brother you can never ever be
[1:02:58] the same again your soul has been set on
[1:03:02] fire Paul in prison you see here is
[1:03:10] testing here is tribulation here are
[1:03:13] things that we go through
[1:03:15] Paul was put into prison and notice here
[1:03:19] he is in prison he says for I know that
[1:03:23] this shall turn to my salvation through
[1:03:30] your prayer he's counting on the church
[1:03:35] praying
[1:03:36] and the supply of the spirit of Jesus
[1:03:39] Christ according to my earnest
[1:03:43] expectation and my hope that in nothing
[1:03:49] I shall be ashamed but that with all
[1:03:54] boldness as always so now also Christ
[1:03:58] shall be magnified in my body whether it
[1:04:02] be by life or by death what was Paul
[1:04:08] saying I have not put God in a box I'm
[1:04:10] not going to be ashamed according to
[1:04:12] their earnest expectation what I know is
[1:04:14] is the situation I'm in I'm trusting in
[1:04:17] him for salvation in the midst of this
[1:04:19] trial I'm trusting him for salvation in
[1:04:22] the midst of this situation and whether
[1:04:24] or not whether I live or whether I die
[1:04:26] he is my salvation and my expectation is
[1:04:30] in deliverance oh my he's never failed
[1:04:34] me and he can't fail me he's not going
[1:04:36] to start failing us and nothing shall I
[1:04:38] be ashamed oh my let's kind of maybe
[1:04:41] switch gear just a moment here romans 8
[1:04:44] verse 17 notice the promise and if
[1:04:47] children then heirs heirs of God and
[1:04:49] joint-heirs with Christ if so be that we
[1:04:53] suffer with him that we may also be
[1:04:55] glorified together for I reckon man that
[1:04:59] the sufferings of this present time are
[1:05:01] not worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:05:05] which shall be revealed in us your
[1:05:08] powers and the present testings and
[1:05:11] trial and tribulation they are not
[1:05:13] worthy to even be put on the same basis
[1:05:17] of what awaits us all
[1:05:19] what does Paul say he's got the helmet
[1:05:22] of salvation all and others are looking
[1:05:24] and saying Paul it's in a midst of a bad
[1:05:27] situation
[1:05:28] but Paul could say yet in the midst of
[1:05:31] it we have a real true expectation the
[1:05:36] sufferings that we're going through are
[1:05:38] not worthy to be compared to the glory
[1:05:41] which shall be revealed for the earnest
[1:05:43] expectation of the creature waiteth
[1:05:48] for the manifestation of the sons of God
[1:05:52] the earth is groaning the earth is
[1:05:57] groaning the earth is longing you know
[1:05:59] why the earth for Omaha the earth is
[1:06:03] just like you and I we were longing for
[1:06:05] life you might have south east and south
[1:06:07] displeasure when here did this and tried
[1:06:10] to satisfy everything but what it was
[1:06:12] there was a first down on the inside
[1:06:13] just like this earth has a thirst it is
[1:06:16] part of redemptions plan and remember as
[1:06:18] much as it had a longing within its
[1:06:21] heart God would actually begin to move
[1:06:23] upon that earth because the world itself
[1:06:26] is not the earth the world is the system
[1:06:29] that is upon the earth that's why
[1:06:31] there's got to come a change I'm moving
[1:06:34] out of that world or glory and why is
[1:06:37] the moving out of that world that there
[1:06:39] might be a cleansing that that kingdom
[1:06:41] of heaven might be set down upon this
[1:06:44] earth Oh glory it's waiting for the
[1:06:47] manifestation of the sons of God not
[1:06:49] something out there in the Millennium
[1:06:50] but right now for the manifestation of
[1:06:53] the sons of God we do not become sons in
[1:06:56] the Millennium it's right now we become
[1:06:58] sons if you if we can just capitalize on
[1:07:00] this for a moment
[1:07:02] brother branham it's not the Spirit of
[1:07:03] God it's not urging us says though that
[1:07:06] we're going around oh you're the
[1:07:07] manifestation of the sons of God you
[1:07:09] need to go around and do great signs and
[1:07:10] wonders no we do not do signs and
[1:07:12] wonders signs and wonders follow us they
[1:07:15] are a part that company behind our life
[1:07:17] but the reality of what sons and
[1:07:19] daughters of God is here's where the
[1:07:21] reality of the adoption of the Lord
[1:07:24] Jesus Christ moving in our life that we
[1:07:26] recognize like the prodigal son I always
[1:07:29] was the son and daughter of God
[1:07:31] I always belonged to him and the real
[1:07:33] reality and truth of election it breaks
[1:07:36] forth upon our life to recognize that we
[1:07:39] have always belonged to God I've always
[1:07:42] been a she but God has drawn me into his
[1:07:45] pasture and he has birthed me into that
[1:07:49] house the house of God the Word of God
[1:07:52] Jesus Christ
[1:07:53] I have been birthed into him he has
[1:07:57] brought me to his banqueting table his
[1:08:00] banner over me is loves glory waiting
[1:08:05] for the manifestation of the sons of God
[1:08:07] and his sons of God we stand in this
[1:08:10] hour on our god-given rights let me just
[1:08:13] tell you right now as the son and
[1:08:14] daughter of God you've got a right to
[1:08:16] stand right there even in your home I
[1:08:18] don't care how close that coronavirus
[1:08:19] would come I don't care what sickness it
[1:08:21] is I don't care what comes your way a
[1:08:23] troublesome fault or whatever more
[1:08:25] you've got a ride as a son and daughter
[1:08:27] of God just say I've got the token
[1:08:28] applied to this house and this body
[1:08:30] itself it is not my permanent
[1:08:33] inheritance but it's my possession there
[1:08:35] is no room for you in here there's no
[1:08:37] room for you here and there ain't no
[1:08:39] room for you here I'm telling you get
[1:08:41] out of here you don't got no right what
[1:08:43] is that that's a son and daughter of God
[1:08:45] that's exercising Dominion by the
[1:08:48] revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:08:50] that has come to you and I all glory for
[1:08:53] the creature was made subject to vanity
[1:08:56] not willingly not willingly God did not
[1:08:59] make this happen remember they had a
[1:09:03] choice in the beginning but God
[1:09:05] subjected it he placed this right here
[1:09:08] the choice before him but by reason of
[1:09:12] him who have subjected the same in hope
[1:09:16] see remember when the fall took place
[1:09:18] before there was atom molecule Stardust
[1:09:22] before even the coming forth were called
[1:09:26] here the word the issuing forth remember
[1:09:28] the word was already he is the word it
[1:09:31] was with God already it was already
[1:09:33] settled is that right so he has
[1:09:38] subjected the same in Hope because the
[1:09:41] creature itself also shall be delivered
[1:09:45] from the bondage of corruption whoa
[1:09:49] that's a truth ain't it
[1:09:51] amen the younger I got I mean the older
[1:09:54] I get you begin to recognize man more
[1:09:56] and more the corruption it is pains and
[1:09:58] eights and stretches and other things
[1:10:00] that you never had to think about before
[1:10:02] but what is it it's a bondage of
[1:10:04] corruption but thanks be to God
[1:10:06] Liberty's already come on the inside
[1:10:08] we've already been set free from the
[1:10:10] first birth and by the Dominion of the
[1:10:13] second birth of the set by the second
[1:10:14] Adam we have an authority and we can say
[1:10:17] I'm gonna lead you to a body change I am
[1:10:21] going to change you is that right
[1:10:24] remember Jesus he raised up his own body
[1:10:28] come on now hey man you know what I'm
[1:10:31] quoting from in the rapture he says I'll
[1:10:33] shall be delivered from the bondage of
[1:10:34] corruption into the glorious liberty of
[1:10:37] the children of God for we know that the
[1:10:40] whole creation groaneth and travaileth
[1:10:42] in pain together until now and not only
[1:10:45] they but ourselves also which have the
[1:10:48] firstfruits of the Spirit even we
[1:10:50] ourselves groan within ourselves waiting
[1:10:53] for the adoption to wit the redemption
[1:10:57] of our bodies you see you can tell you
[1:11:01] can tell by the life that's being lived
[1:11:03] if the helmet of salvation is on and if
[1:11:07] you've got sidetracked for some reason
[1:11:08] in your life maybe there's been business
[1:11:10] affairs and other things you've gone
[1:11:12] into traps and snares and listen friends
[1:11:14] traps and snares are not altogether well
[1:11:17] you know brother Simon I shouldn't
[1:11:18] started watching movies or heard this or
[1:11:20] that no no you underestimate the devil
[1:11:22] so much traps and snares can come in the
[1:11:25] form of family traps and snares can come
[1:11:27] in the form of things that will actually
[1:11:29] fall and you come right into it it don't
[1:11:32] look like saying don't seem like saying
[1:11:34] it seems like everything is alright and
[1:11:36] notice what happens it begins then has a
[1:11:38] trap to try to take away but God gives
[1:11:41] grace for you to say wait a minute here
[1:11:43] I have approached this situation without
[1:11:46] the helmet of salvation because remember
[1:11:48] the helmet of salvation it is made out
[1:11:51] of brass brass is divine judgment you
[1:11:55] are to judge every thought every
[1:11:57] situation we are to pass it through that
[1:12:00] of the economy of God and say is this
[1:12:03] going to draw me closer or is it going
[1:12:05] to take me away if it takes me away it's
[1:12:08] not of God I don't care how good it
[1:12:10] seems outright it seems how innocent it
[1:12:13] seems if it gets between me and Jesus
[1:12:16] it is what God wants for me to do I'm
[1:12:20] talking about adopted sons and daughters
[1:12:22] of God for we are saved by hope well I
[1:12:30] thought we would say by faith we are but
[1:12:32] remember faith is the substance of
[1:12:34] things hoped for faith gives faith the
[1:12:37] revelation places it there and we begin
[1:12:40] to expect we are saved by hope but hope
[1:12:46] that is not but hope that is seen is not
[1:12:48] hope for what a man seeth why does here
[1:12:51] yet hope for but if we hope for that we
[1:12:53] see not then why do we with patience
[1:12:55] wait for it now every one of us have him
[1:12:58] have either been in or we are in one or
[1:13:00] even and we're looking at the situation
[1:13:02] that we're in now throughout the world
[1:13:05] and to recognize that within it we are
[1:13:08] not we are not as the children of God we
[1:13:10] are not to be in a manner of where we
[1:13:13] are just defeatist in our minds you
[1:13:15] understand what I'm talking about
[1:13:17] we are not to be walking around and and
[1:13:20] defeated but we are saved by hope it is
[1:13:22] just like you could walk right into this
[1:13:24] church or right there in your living
[1:13:26] room you put on it you put on a message
[1:13:28] or you're listening to the word as it's
[1:13:30] coming forth right now you might be so
[1:13:32] low in your spirit you might be down you
[1:13:35] might be going through a hard time right
[1:13:37] now in the midst maybe of your body or
[1:13:39] the situation that is taking place but
[1:13:42] there is something that reigns within
[1:13:44] our heart that says I'm going to be
[1:13:46] saved by hope and what does that mean it
[1:13:48] means I've got an expectation I don't
[1:13:50] know how God's going to do it this
[1:13:51] morning but I know that God's got
[1:13:53] something for me and God's gonna speak
[1:13:55] to my heart he's gonna do something
[1:13:58] that'll help me and encourage me and
[1:14:00] lift me I'm not asking him to take me
[1:14:02] out of the trial
[1:14:03] I'm just asking him for the strength and
[1:14:05] the grace to go through that trial I am
[1:14:08] saved by hope I have an expectation when
[1:14:12] I come to the house of God when I'm
[1:14:14] listening to the message when I'm in
[1:14:17] Oh God he is gonna speak and meet my
[1:14:20] need that's the same kind of expectation
[1:14:23] for the rapture so you see why we need
[1:14:26] this helm and we're not waiting on the
[1:14:27] helmet to the moment before the body
[1:14:29] change no we have the helmet now and
[1:14:31] where to put it on use it this is live
[1:14:35] that Paul would go on to say rejoicing
[1:14:37] in hope this is how we're to live
[1:14:39] rejoicing in Hope now you listen if in
[1:14:47] our minds or our hearts we look at this
[1:14:49] Scripture and this seems like a walk
[1:14:51] Disney scripture to you first of all you
[1:14:53] need to repent you need to ask God for
[1:14:55] looking at Scripture and with unbelief
[1:14:56] you need to look back at the scripture
[1:14:59] and realize when Godhra had Paul wrought
[1:15:02] this by unction were to rejoice and hope
[1:15:04] it did not mean that we would know the
[1:15:06] outcome we don't know how things are
[1:15:07] going to come out we don't even know in
[1:15:09] this situation with that of the virus
[1:15:11] but you know what that's not what I'm
[1:15:12] drawing my joy from my joy has never
[1:15:15] been upon what the world can produce it
[1:15:17] is based on the Lord he is seeing us
[1:15:20] through and God through the luthier
[1:15:22] through all of it
[1:15:23] he is coming and may not be just not
[1:15:26] just talking about coming but you
[1:15:28] understand he is coming to minister and
[1:15:31] see us through so rejoicing in Hope but
[1:15:37] the reason a lot of this don't take
[1:15:38] place like verse 12 is because the
[1:15:40] helmet you know the only time that a
[1:15:43] helmet came off was for a period of rest
[1:15:46] but let me just say this to you we've
[1:15:48] entered into God's rest and we don't
[1:15:50] rest till we get me on the river you
[1:15:52] need that helmet on for every situation
[1:15:54] this is an hour you better be looking
[1:15:57] twice before you make a step you better
[1:16:00] be looking twice before you make
[1:16:02] commitments you better be looking twice
[1:16:05] why it's a time of such subtility such
[1:16:09] settlements that's all around I didn't
[1:16:10] say that to scare you I'm telling you as
[1:16:12] a child of God I believe the maturity
[1:16:14] has adopted sons and daughters of God we
[1:16:16] are evaluating our life I want to get
[1:16:18] closer to God I don't want to get
[1:16:20] further away I want to get closer to him
[1:16:23] right I want to live as the Prophet
[1:16:25] would say it
[1:16:27] so close to him till I know when he
[1:16:29] comes he'll take me rejoicing in Hope
[1:16:33] patient in tribulation continuing
[1:16:36] instant in prayer
[1:16:39] proverbs 10:28 the hope of the righteous
[1:16:43] shall be gladness but the expectation of
[1:16:47] the wicked shall perish
[1:16:50] Oh mah Psalms 135 I wait for the Lord my
[1:16:54] soul doth wait and in his word do I hope
[1:16:57] my soul waited for the Lord more than
[1:17:00] they that watch for the morning I say
[1:17:03] more than they that watch for the
[1:17:05] morning do you realize what David is
[1:17:07] saying the morning was a certain thing
[1:17:09] to come they had an appointed watchman
[1:17:12] that would be divided by three sections
[1:17:15] as I write three sections in the night
[1:17:17] and there would be one that would be
[1:17:19] waiting and watching for the morning to
[1:17:22] announce the heralding of the morning
[1:17:24] and David could say I wait for the Lord
[1:17:27] my soul doth wait and hope in his word
[1:17:30] what is he looking at it is waiting on
[1:17:33] God to fulfill his word o my brother and
[1:17:37] sister don't have a contrived idea don't
[1:17:40] have a contrived thought but wait on God
[1:17:44] to fulfill his word many times that's
[1:17:47] why people get disappointed about the
[1:17:49] Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is never
[1:17:51] disappointed anybody but sometimes when
[1:17:54] a person will go to ask in God the Lord
[1:17:56] Jesus I want the Holy Ghost they want
[1:17:58] God to come and put something on them
[1:18:00] but they're not willing to actually die
[1:18:02] and receive it would be like me holding
[1:18:04] up this bottle right here it's full of
[1:18:06] water and it would be like me to ask him
[1:18:08] brother Richard brother Richard pour
[1:18:10] some water in here he'd look at me and
[1:18:11] say you're nuts brother Samuel there's
[1:18:13] water in that bottle already but the
[1:18:15] only way that I can ask for a real
[1:18:17] feeling in this bottle I've got to get
[1:18:19] rid of the stuff that's on the inside
[1:18:20] and that comes according to his word and
[1:18:23] when we come according to God's Word
[1:18:25] remember it is never a question there is
[1:18:28] not one problem
[1:18:29] in god's word that he ever made with any
[1:18:33] little small claims or fine print
[1:18:35] beneath it but every promise of God is a
[1:18:38] and a man and the Spirit of God makes it
[1:18:42] real in that generation I'm waitin more
[1:18:49] than they that watch for the morning
[1:18:51] David said I know the Lord's I know the
[1:18:53] Lord's coming what brother Samuel what
[1:18:56] I'm praying for you know I got this real
[1:18:59] hard situation on my job and the way
[1:19:01] that I'm praying I'm just praying that
[1:19:03] you know I'm just praying God's just
[1:19:05] gonna move me out of the job
[1:19:08] or move my boss out of the way so I want
[1:19:11] you to pray with me in other words what
[1:19:13] you're saying is brother Samuel I'd like
[1:19:14] you like Aaron to lend your hands I'm
[1:19:17] gonna give you the gold and I want you
[1:19:18] to make a golden calf I want you to
[1:19:20] create an expectation of how we're gonna
[1:19:22] do this no sir it's God that must be the
[1:19:26] one we're expecting and let me tell you
[1:19:28] something the way that God fulfills his
[1:19:30] word as believers believers we as
[1:19:33] believers that by His grace have
[1:19:35] recognized him in the fulfillment of his
[1:19:38] word we will always recognize God in the
[1:19:41] fulfillment of his word I tell you
[1:19:46] friends that's a good you did good good
[1:19:47] checkmate right there to check and see
[1:19:50] is this something you're crafting you're
[1:19:52] trying to make because if you craft it
[1:19:54] and make it you have problems there'll
[1:19:56] be things that will follow you or you
[1:19:57] might be a child of God him indeed and
[1:20:00] saying Dean well you might love the Lord
[1:20:02] with all your heart but remember even
[1:20:03] for decisions that you make that would
[1:20:06] be bad decisions God don't snatch you
[1:20:08] out of bad decisions but you will have
[1:20:10] to pay you will have to go through it
[1:20:12] and ask God to help you and teach you
[1:20:14] and say lord help me not to be so
[1:20:16] hard-headed help me to be a little bit
[1:20:17] more sensitive help me to be a little
[1:20:19] bit more yielded Lord let it not be my
[1:20:22] way let it be your way Oh God
[1:20:26] well maybe I'm just preaching to
[1:20:29] everybody else I've done no I'm
[1:20:34] preaching to me and I maybe I'm just
[1:20:35] preaching no maybe it ain't nobody else
[1:20:37] probably nobody may be from our
[1:20:38] congregation cuz I don't know how well
[1:20:43] psalms 147 11 the Lord taketh pleasure
[1:20:51] in them to fear Him in those that hope
[1:20:55] in his mercy o that's what I want his
[1:21:00] mercy
[1:21:01] I'm glad every time his mercy has
[1:21:03] stepped in aren't you
[1:21:04] we've been in the midst of a trial or a
[1:21:06] test his mercy mercy walks in mercy
[1:21:10] steps into the situation his kindness
[1:21:13] home eyes the Hebrew would say it's just
[1:21:15] said his kindness his faithfulness oh
[1:21:18] his loving-kindness notice here is Paul
[1:21:21] let's Brignac over now into a time in
[1:21:24] his life he's near departure and Paul's
[1:21:27] given a little bit of testimony of God's
[1:21:29] grace in his life even prior to his
[1:21:31] departure because remember the helmet of
[1:21:33] hope of salvation
[1:21:34] we are expecting the Lord in every
[1:21:37] situation every trial every sickness we
[1:21:39] are looking to the Lord not some way
[1:21:41] that we're looking looking at it we're
[1:21:43] looking to him is that right we're
[1:21:46] looking for the coming of the Lord in
[1:21:48] our generation we know that this is the
[1:21:50] season of his coming
[1:21:52] so Paul now thinking and bringing it
[1:21:54] down to our everyday life because we
[1:21:56] need this for our everyday life and my
[1:21:59] first answer no man stood with me but
[1:22:01] all men for sick me I pray that I pray
[1:22:05] God that it may not be to their charge
[1:22:07] notwithstanding the Lord stood with me
[1:22:12] and strengthened me that by me the
[1:22:17] preaching might be fully known and that
[1:22:20] the Gentiles might hear and I was
[1:22:23] delivered out of the mouth of the lion
[1:22:30] it was not a literal lion that Paul had
[1:22:33] faced he's talking about the opposition
[1:22:36] of Satan to the gospel and he says I was
[1:22:40] delivered out of the mouth of the lion
[1:22:43] notice not from his glare not from his
[1:22:46] roar he said he had me in his mouth he
[1:22:51] had me in his mouth it wasn't just fill
[1:22:54] in his hot breath
[1:22:55] I felt his gums around it remember this
[1:23:00] line called Satan remember he don't have
[1:23:02] no teeth hello somebody he ain't got no
[1:23:06] teeth that's kind of kitty cats I like
[1:23:08] to pet the ones no head no teeth or
[1:23:11] claws but noticed I was delivered out of
[1:23:14] the mouth of the lion who delivered him
[1:23:18] same God to deliver David and the Lord
[1:23:21] notice from this testimony notice
[1:23:24] through tribulation patience experience
[1:23:27] hope abounding of Hope and the Lord
[1:23:31] shall deliver me from every evil work
[1:23:35] and will preserve me unto his heavenly
[1:23:38] kingdom to whom be glory for ever and
[1:23:42] ever amen
[1:23:43] you know Paul said every evil work even
[1:23:46] of what lays before me the Lord shall
[1:23:49] deliver me and he will carry me safely
[1:23:53] into his heavenly kingdom
[1:23:56] there's nothing can come my way until
[1:23:59] the purpose of God has been fulfilled
[1:24:03] oh now remember what I just read to you
[1:24:10] this is a testimony of Paul when he's
[1:24:15] getting ready for his heavenly departure
[1:24:22] remember will be read last week when
[1:24:24] they were in that ship all hopes was
[1:24:28] gone that we should be saved it was not
[1:24:32] something where Paul remember was
[1:24:34] wondering Lord am I yours Drive belong
[1:24:35] to you that's something right now let me
[1:24:37] tell you right now as the bride of Jesus
[1:24:39] Christ as
[1:24:40] everyone everyone that's listening on
[1:24:42] the sound of my voice it's a time to
[1:24:44] know where you stand and if you don't
[1:24:47] know where you stand you better ask the
[1:24:48] Lord Lord I need to get on some solid
[1:24:50] ground I need to know where I'm standing
[1:24:53] with you I need to know and be sure I
[1:24:56] need to be able to stand in the power of
[1:24:59] his might and I'm telling it really
[1:25:02] really straight now you need to know
[1:25:04] where you are standing in this hour
[1:25:06] because you see Paul in the midst of
[1:25:09] that time he had made that he remember
[1:25:11] he made the declaration they didn't know
[1:25:13] if it's going to be saved or not out of
[1:25:14] that they didn't know if there's gonna
[1:25:15] be shipwrecked or not but the word gave
[1:25:17] the Lord gave a word and delivered them
[1:25:19] now notice
[1:25:20] let me read here then another part here
[1:25:23] in 2nd Corinthians chapter 1 and our
[1:25:26] hope verse 7 of you is steadfast Wow
[1:25:30] our hope of you couldn't be because
[1:25:32] Paul's looking to flesh he's got to be
[1:25:35] confident into the revelation is that
[1:25:37] right knowing that as you are partakers
[1:25:40] of the suffering so shall you be also of
[1:25:44] the consolation you are more comfort
[1:25:46] what are the saying I've got the
[1:25:47] comforter but you are more comfort more
[1:25:50] comfort comes with more trials because
[1:25:53] it comforts you to know greater is He
[1:25:55] that's in you than he that's in the
[1:25:56] world you see God already knows it but
[1:25:59] he's letting you know it for we would
[1:26:01] not brethren have you ignorant of our
[1:26:03] trouble which came to us in Asia
[1:26:09] that we were pressed out of measure
[1:26:13] above strength in so much that we
[1:26:18] despaired that were despaired means to
[1:26:21] renounce all hope even of life beyond
[1:26:28] what that of a moral man could stand or
[1:26:32] take Paul said we just renounced all
[1:26:35] hope of life but we have the sentence of
[1:26:43] death in ourselves that we should not
[1:26:47] trust in ourselves but in God which
[1:26:52] raised the dead
[1:26:54] you know Paul was drawing upon the
[1:26:57] experience of the quickening power in
[1:27:00] his life that has raised up the son and
[1:27:03] daughter of God on the inside and Paul
[1:27:05] said he did what no one else can do this
[1:27:09] situation is nothing from the Lord
[1:27:12] though I woke in the midst of death it
[1:27:14] don't seem like there's any hope around
[1:27:17] me but I can go and stand on this
[1:27:19] assurance the same God who quickened me
[1:27:23] that I would pass from death unto life
[1:27:25] he's the same God to stand and deliver
[1:27:28] me in this hour who delivered us from so
[1:27:36] great a death and death deliver in whom
[1:27:41] we trust that he will yet deliver us ye
[1:27:49] also helping together by prayer for us
[1:27:51] that for the gift bestowed upon us by
[1:27:54] the means of many persons thanks may be
[1:27:56] given by many on our behalf
[1:28:07] let me read this scripture and we'll
[1:28:10] close
[1:28:16] Jeremiah 17
[1:28:19] verse 5
[1:28:24] thus saith the Lord cursed be the man
[1:28:27] that trusteth in man and maketh flesh
[1:28:31] his arm and whose heart departed from
[1:28:36] the Lord if God has ever touched your
[1:28:41] heart say Lord take me all the way I
[1:28:48] don't want my heart Lord to depart for
[1:28:55] he shall be like the heat this is a man
[1:28:58] who departs he'll be like a heath in the
[1:29:01] desert and shall not see when good
[1:29:05] cometh you realize a person that gets
[1:29:08] away from the presence of God listen to
[1:29:10] me friends it can sit right here in
[1:29:12] these pews but they get away from the
[1:29:14] presence of God they get away from from
[1:29:17] from a personal walk with God they get
[1:29:19] away they get the order of things men
[1:29:21] twist it around in their life you know
[1:29:23] this very thing will come out they can't
[1:29:25] even see good when it's coming to it
[1:29:27] even when there's correction that can
[1:29:29] come to their life they don't recognize
[1:29:30] it as good you say how in the world is
[1:29:32] good how is correction good the goodness
[1:29:35] of the Lord leadeth us to repentance
[1:29:37] David said I had fainted in the land of
[1:29:39] the living unless I had I had hoped to
[1:29:41] see the goodness of the Lord we want the
[1:29:43] goodness of Almighty God but you see
[1:29:46] when we ourselves we it's not God
[1:29:49] pulling us out God never ran Kane out
[1:29:51] Kane himself willfully walked out of the
[1:29:56] presence of God and you know what
[1:29:58] happened to him he became a wanderer a
[1:30:01] bag Aban and all how the Prophet would
[1:30:05] admonish us in growing greatest battle
[1:30:07] fought he said you don't want to be
[1:30:08] wandering stars we want to be divinely
[1:30:13] placed has he has wrote his word there
[1:30:18] in the heavens for he shall be like the
[1:30:21] heath in the desert and shall not see
[1:30:24] when good cometh but shall inhabit the
[1:30:27] parched places in the wilderness
[1:30:31] you know what happens where there's a
[1:30:32] lack of water you get prickly I said you
[1:30:35] get prickly the cactus needles
[1:30:37] themselves remember the Bible says that
[1:30:40] when he will come in that of the
[1:30:43] millennium he will cross the desert to
[1:30:45] blossom like a rose he'll take patch
[1:30:49] ground and there will be water needles
[1:30:53] on a cactus that actually should be
[1:30:56] better beautiful flowers but because of
[1:30:58] the lack of the environment but shall
[1:31:04] inhabit the parched places in the
[1:31:07] wilderness in a salt land and not
[1:31:09] inhabited but let me read our promises
[1:31:14] blessed is the man that trusteth in the
[1:31:18] Lord and whose hope the Lord is present
[1:31:26] tense the Lord is this man is blessed
[1:31:32] let's describe him for he shall be as a
[1:31:37] tree planted by the waters he's drawing
[1:31:43] from old and new Testament he's drawing
[1:31:48] and that spreadeth out her roots by the
[1:31:55] river
[1:31:56] how do roots get spread out through
[1:31:59] tests and trials is that right the
[1:32:03] shaking of tests and trials it causes it
[1:32:06] to loosen and it's allowing that
[1:32:08] loosening up so those root roots can
[1:32:10] continue to grow so what's happening the
[1:32:12] roots themselves has it continues to go
[1:32:15] the god of Hope and make you too bound
[1:32:17] remember it's moving those roots are
[1:32:19] moving what's into it it is moving even
[1:32:21] deeper and deeper it's drawing from
[1:32:25] sources that are not even visible to the
[1:32:29] eye but the roots are bowing down deeper
[1:32:32] and deeper and deeper is becoming more
[1:32:35] solid they become a Moore's
[1:32:37] a believer their experience with God
[1:32:40] becomes more sure more sure more sure
[1:32:43] they themselves are further grounded and
[1:32:56] shall not see when heat cometh the bill
[1:33:03] lets us know he's coming he comes the
[1:33:07] heat is going to come but that's why the
[1:33:10] roots grow deep because for the heat
[1:33:12] that's coming it prepares to endure when
[1:33:17] everything else around up here Saint oh
[1:33:19] my goodness I'll tell you this is
[1:33:20] terrible my man this is such a terrible
[1:33:22] time this is such a horrible time but
[1:33:26] for this one who's trusting in the Lord
[1:33:29] whose hope the Lord is he's gotten
[1:33:32] resources
[1:33:33] he's got spiritual food a new season
[1:33:35] that nobody knows nothing about it's
[1:33:38] like an Elijah tucked up there mother
[1:33:39] arrived by the brook of Cherith or glory
[1:33:42] and shall not see when he cometh but her
[1:33:44] leaf shall be green it testifies of what
[1:33:49] life life is present what do the leaves
[1:33:53] do it is the food making source of the

[1:34:05] of through the different openings on it
[1:34:07] where it'll actually take in the carbon
[1:34:09] dioxide that is out there in the air
[1:34:11] it'll take him the energy from the Sun
[1:34:14] and it actually has within it the
[1:34:16] ability to transform that to actually

[1:38:27] hope I shall not be ashamed because
[1:38:29] sometimes when we can get we get our
[1:38:31] hopes up and we get to looking for

[1:41:19] Watchmen looketh and waiteth for the
[1:41:22] morning he would know that the morning
[1:41:25] is certain so that watchman would be
[1:41:29] waiting he wouldn't even know the
[1:41:31] watchman would know what direction to be
