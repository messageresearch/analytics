[23:03] strength
[23:10] [Music]
[23:14] is
[23:17] [Music]
[23:44] amen i want to read here just a
[23:48] testimony from brother drake
[23:51] regarding his stepfather
[23:53] he's asking you just wanted to thank the
[23:56] church thank you for praying for my
[23:58] stepfather dave
[24:00] he passed away peacefully monday morning
[24:02] from heart failure although we were
[24:04] praying for his physical healing it was
[24:06] more rewarding to witness his spiritual
[24:08] healing through god's mercy
[24:10] please pray for
[24:12] my mother's salvation
[24:14] so we want to just continue to remember
[24:17] the family in prayer
[24:18] also remember as he requested his
[24:20] mother's salvation as well
[24:23] and
[24:24] sometimes the things that you know
[24:26] outcomes that we
[24:28] are looking for and anytime we pray we
[24:31] should always expect
[24:33] for god to answer and fulfill according
[24:36] to his word
[24:38] and he always does healing always comes
[24:41] and if you remember back i think was
[24:42] about a year a year and a half ago and
[24:44] we we took that little thought with
[24:46] healing and the four anointings and how
[24:49] that healing sometimes healing will come
[24:51] and my just a miracle just drops right
[24:54] in there then there's other times where
[24:55] healing comes and it's through a process
[24:58] and then there's another time where
[25:00] healing comes and it's the ox anointing
[25:02] and that healing is not on this side but
[25:05] on the other side
[25:06] so in any way there's there's no into
[25:09] the promises of god they are every one
[25:11] of them sure and amen and so we just
[25:15] thank god for his mercy i want to just
[25:17] continue to keep them in prayer also i
[25:20] want to ask that you would just continue
[25:22] to keep
[25:23] the soriano family in prayer as well as
[25:26] the uh
[25:28] the church there in the philippines and
[25:31] i've talked with uh sister cynthia and
[25:34] obviously as you can understand it's
[25:36] just something that's very
[25:37] difficult uh everyone
[25:40] you know everywhere you go there's a new
[25:42] first and uh she's asking prayer because
[25:44] she said i you know
[25:46] just being able to go back to church
[25:49] and uh to see everything and
[25:51] there's just just so much around that
[25:54] just would remind her of brother rowell
[25:57] and so much labor has went in there and
[25:59] so we want to just continue to remember
[26:01] them in prayer
[26:02] during this time as well that god will
[26:04] just continue to give comfort to them
[26:07] and
[26:09] i think that's about it also remember
[26:11] the uh
[26:13] the
[26:14] dinner on this coming
[26:16] sunday we've uh went ahead and we
[26:19] cancelled that for this sunday which you
[26:21] already received the email announcement
[26:24] about that as well so award willing we
[26:27] do have one uh there's one plan that's
[26:29] at the end of october right at the very
[26:32] end of october so
[26:33] we have that this one right here we lord
[26:35] willing we will we'll reschedule it
[26:38] for a later time
[26:40] so also want you to keep in mind lord
[26:43] willing with brother
[26:45] homer longoria you'll be here with us a
[26:48] few weeks
[26:49] i think it's the second weekend of
[26:52] october so if you'll just keep him
[26:55] in prayer
[26:56] those meetings that we have coming up
[26:58] there
[26:59] i don't think there's anything else that
[27:01] i'm forgetting but
[27:03] if there is hopefully it comes back to
[27:05] me
[27:07] i use every everything at my disposal to
[27:09] try to remember
[27:11] but
[27:12] we just want to greet you in the name of
[27:14] the lord tonight so good to be in the
[27:16] house of god together
[27:18] and so let's just stand if we would and
[27:21] let's just go to him in a word of prayer
[27:23] i'd like to thank the musicians amen may
[27:25] god bless you
[27:28] tonight
[27:29] amen let's just go to him in a word of
[27:31] prayer
[27:32] heavenly father lord as we approach
[27:36] the lord in this moment of the service
[27:39] lord knowing that dear god within
[27:41] ourselves lord
[27:43] there is no sufficiency in ourselves
[27:46] lord
[27:47] father it would be
[27:49] foolish for us to trust in ourselves
[27:52] we find over and over lord how that you
[27:55] would mention in your word
[27:58] that even when
[27:59] israel
[28:00] many times lord there would be times
[28:02] that they would go to
[28:04] lord rely
[28:06] upon lord egypt and upon horses and
[28:09] chariots and we know that's the world
[28:12] and we know that dear god that we're
[28:14] called in this hour lord not to rely
[28:17] upon any lord of our natural senses or
[28:20] spiritual senses but we are to rely
[28:23] upon you father
[28:25] to rest and to trust in you
[28:29] lord truly as the scripture said that we
[28:32] walk not by sight lord and that's more
[28:34] than just these natural eyes it's
[28:37] everything that's around us lord but
[28:39] faith looks to the unseen
[28:42] it stabilizes us lord it strengthens us
[28:46] it guides us lord
[28:48] it's the answer lord for every question
[28:51] it's the solution for every problem lord
[28:54] and we thank you for that because we
[28:56] know that lord that that faith that's
[28:58] operating within our life that's not our
[29:01] faith but it's the faith of the son of
[29:03] god
[29:04] who loved us and gave himself for us
[29:06] lord it's your own life that moves
[29:09] within us oh god that pushes our faith
[29:13] lord
[29:14] we thank you lord and we just ask that
[29:17] lord that you would just lord have your
[29:19] way tonight continue to minister to each
[29:22] and every need lord
[29:24] father every unspoken prayer request
[29:26] every spoken prayer request
[29:29] lord jesus we just ask that you'll
[29:31] continue to minister lord to every need
[29:34] lord in every situation oh god
[29:37] father we just invite you tonight lord
[29:40] that you just come lord be the speaker
[29:42] here tonight lord come take control lord
[29:45] i pray in such a special way and every
[29:48] need that we have lord we presented lord
[29:51] before you tonight
[29:52] and lord regardless lord of the text we
[29:56] know as believers lord that god that
[29:58] there is a pool within our hearts lord
[30:01] and you are mindful of those needs lord
[30:03] before there was even a flea or a gnat
[30:06] before there was an atom or a molecule
[30:08] you knew lord that we'd be gathered here
[30:10] tonight lord and father you've already
[30:13] made provision lord jesus so lord we
[30:16] rest and we trust the lord tonight oh
[30:19] god and we invite you lord to just come
[30:21] and minister in a special way help me to
[30:24] step aside help the congregation lord
[30:26] father laying aside all the toils and
[30:29] the weariness of this day and of this
[30:31] life lord and just to enter in for these
[30:33] next few moments into your presence lord
[30:36] we just love you father
[30:39] we just love you so much lord we ask
[30:42] your blessing upon the word now
[30:44] in the name of jesus christ
[30:47] amen
[30:49] amen god bless you let's read in in the
[30:52] in the scriptures here in first
[30:53] corinthians 13.
[30:57] i had a little bit of a
[30:58] just getting the notes back there and
[31:00] and you certainly can appreciate
[31:03] everything that's kind of being
[31:05] juggled around and
[31:08] do you have it up now brother brian is
[31:09] it available for me to send that
[31:13] that's okay if it's not just pull up the
[31:15] scriptures it'll be all right
[31:17] first corinthians 13 4
[31:20] you probably already knew we were going
[31:22] there
[31:24] charity suffereth long and is kind
[31:27] charity envieth not
[31:30] charity vaunteth not itself is not
[31:33] puffed up
[31:34] it does not behave itself
[31:37] unseemly it seeketh not her own and is
[31:40] not easily provoked and thinketh
[31:43] no evil amen may god bless the reading
[31:46] of the word as you're being seated
[31:49] i'd like just to continue to
[31:52] just dealing with this thought that
[31:53] we've been looking at here for
[31:56] for some time on honor in the home and
[31:59] taking it from this part that love does
[32:02] not behave itself
[32:04] unseemly
[32:05] and
[32:06] you know over and over as you go through
[32:09] the messages and if you haven't i would
[32:11] invite you to go through the messages on
[32:14] divine love when love is projected and
[32:16] just going through those messages over
[32:18] and over i i just can't tell you
[32:20] i won't just say over the years but i
[32:22] can say that even from last year since
[32:26] when we started looking at some of this
[32:28] on discerning the love of god as they
[32:30] just continued to go over and just
[32:32] continue to listen and to glean
[32:34] and you find that where brother branham
[32:36] will say it over and over again because
[32:38] it's very true
[32:40] you said if god offered me every gift
[32:42] that he had or he says i'll give you
[32:46] my divine love brother brahm said i
[32:49] would take divine love
[32:51] over every gift
[32:53] because if you have divine love then you
[32:56] have what's needed to actually
[32:58] cause the gift to be effective
[33:01] brother branham would say like this he
[33:03] says without love the gift is not
[33:05] effective
[33:06] and so we recognize that a gift itself
[33:09] is to get ourselves out of the way
[33:12] and that's something that regardless if
[33:14] it's a five ministerial office or it's
[33:16] of the nine spiritual gifts it still
[33:19] comes down to every part of our life
[33:21] that daily in our lives to be able to
[33:23] get ourselves out of the way
[33:25] because we're recognizing that the
[33:28] greatest enemy that we have is our own
[33:30] self
[33:31] sometimes we look and say well so and so
[33:33] pushes my buttons but it's your buttons
[33:35] that they're pushing
[33:36] and one day to recognize that those
[33:38] buttons will be gone
[33:40] and those buttons sometimes all those
[33:42] parts that are there is an opportunity
[33:44] for god to manifest his overcoming power
[33:47] through our life you see when god has
[33:50] come in by way of the new birth
[33:52] that it changes our nature our life is
[33:56] our life has changed it's it's such a
[33:58] depth within our life where there is
[34:01] it's it's no it's not us trying to live
[34:03] a christian life but it's christ himself
[34:06] now living
[34:07] in our in the midst of our life brother
[34:09] bannon would put it like this he said
[34:11] it's christ in the very control center
[34:14] of your life and he speaks through your
[34:16] lips he thinks the types of thoughts
[34:19] that he would think through your mind
[34:20] and he acts through your temperament so
[34:24] god setting down in the midst of our
[34:26] life divine love and and i tell you what
[34:29] a great thing that we could have and to
[34:31] have the the love of god and to know
[34:34] that that's the greatest privilege that
[34:36] we can have as a mortal is to be born
[34:38] again of the spirit of almighty god
[34:41] this this is a love that you and i when
[34:44] we speak of it with that of the divine
[34:47] love of almighty god and we look at it
[34:49] and we we recognize that the love of god
[34:52] it makes no exceptions and makes no
[34:54] compromise and it won't do that within
[34:57] us either
[34:58] it doesn't mean that there won't be
[35:00] times that we don't think wrong about
[35:02] something or we might say something
[35:04] wrong but remember the bible tells us
[35:07] grieve not the spirit of god whereby you
[35:11] are sealed until the day of your
[35:12] redemption so it shows that there can be
[35:15] a grieving you know brother branham
[35:16] would put it so plain that the grieving
[35:18] itself doesn't even have to be anything
[35:21] that we would say he said you can even
[35:23] go to start thinking wrongly and the
[35:26] dove will take its flight and as a
[35:28] believer there is there is that part
[35:31] about our life that's to be very
[35:33] sensitive and it's what we delight in is
[35:35] to be in his presence
[35:38] it's to be under under the aroma of the
[35:41] rose of sharon to be anointed with the
[35:44] opium of the lily of the valley it's
[35:47] because within that it doesn't matter
[35:49] what situation we come in in contact
[35:52] with we have confidence in the anointing
[35:54] of god that's upon our life
[35:57] and so when we are seeing these things
[36:00] that are before us and how that love
[36:02] itself does not behave itself unseemly
[36:06] or act unbecomingly we're aware as
[36:09] believers that behavior matters
[36:12] and there are things that we can say
[36:14] well these things some things are just
[36:16] automatic it's automatic in one sense of
[36:18] the word but yet it's also given to you
[36:21] and i to know how to possess our vessel
[36:23] unto sanctification and honor it's also
[36:26] given to us to recognize that there's
[36:28] certain thoughts that can come in but to
[36:30] don't let it reign in your mortal body
[36:33] paul would go on to say give no place to
[36:35] the devil pull down strongholds showing
[36:38] that these things as far as in those
[36:40] outer realms for when a person has
[36:43] really truly been converted born again
[36:46] of the spirit of god the nature of sin
[36:49] is gone from that life on the inside and
[36:53] it is the very nature of god that is
[36:55] being expressed and comes out and even
[36:58] when you or i would be in the wrong or
[37:00] even when we see something it could be
[37:02] somebody else that's in the wrong we
[37:04] don't desire anything to be between us
[37:08] and another child of god or for that
[37:11] matter even anyone who is in the world
[37:14] because the desire is to reflect the
[37:16] lord jesus christ
[37:18] so when we look at this behavior
[37:20] remember brother branham would talk
[37:22] about behavior and how that you can have
[37:25] lives that when god can begin to deal
[37:28] with alive and it begins to speak to
[37:30] that life and the life you know here the
[37:33] heart begins to surrender it repents and
[37:36] it comes to the lord still has all you
[37:38] know of the uncleanness about it and
[37:41] remember brother brown will take this
[37:42] and the message is hear ye him and he'll
[37:44] speak about it in the hidden life and
[37:47] other places of how that the behavior
[37:49] matters and the conduct of our life
[37:52] because the objective is to get into
[37:55] that secret place with almighty god and
[37:58] you see there's a word now think about
[38:00] this the conduct and behavior there's a
[38:03] word that comes to you and i to correct
[38:06] us every son that cometh to god must
[38:09] must receive correction in his life it's
[38:12] a spirit of god that deals with our life
[38:14] and as we re as we yield to what paul
[38:17] called the spirit of grace then god
[38:20] releases to you and i the strength that
[38:22] we have need of and there's a cleansing
[38:24] that comes in our life with the ultimate
[38:26] objective is to come into that place of
[38:29] a union with god to where that it's no
[38:33] it's not the struggle but now it becomes
[38:36] under the influence of almighty god
[38:39] who's there to guide and direct our
[38:41] behavior to where our behavior we become
[38:44] known as a christian
[38:47] simply by the actions from our life
[38:51] so when we recognize this that when when
[38:54] when when paul would write of this it
[38:57] does not behave itself unseemly and as i
[39:00] said you know we can look at things and
[39:03] there's not one of us in here where
[39:05] there's things that you haven't had to
[39:07] come back maybe you said something wrong
[39:09] or maybe it wasn't necessarily you said
[39:12] something wrong but in your spirit you
[39:14] were troubled and how you spoke
[39:17] something then then the conviction of
[39:19] the holy spirit will come upon your life
[39:21] and said go make that right
[39:24] you see what is it it's the love of god
[39:26] that will not compromise
[39:29] you see the love of god is always there
[39:31] to help us to discern motives and
[39:35] objectives
[39:36] and so when we're when we when we see
[39:38] this we we realize that it's it's this
[39:42] love that is a love that you and i can
[39:44] never ascend to but rather it's the love
[39:47] of god that descended down to you and i
[39:50] and came to you and i and drew us to him
[39:54] that we might be united with him
[39:57] now i want to go into a scripture here
[39:58] if you'll turn with me to ecclesiastes
[40:01] chapter 9
[40:02] verse 7
[40:04] and
[40:07] [Music]
[40:08] just turn with me to ecclesiastes
[40:10] chapter 9 verse 7.
[40:13] let me just let me if you don't mind let
[40:15] me just send this here to to brother
[40:17] brian so he can have some of this right
[40:19] here to display
[40:21] for us
[40:25] i love technology
[40:28] love it when it works
[40:32] well when it doesn't
[40:45] how many appreciate what brother brian
[40:46] does here
[40:49] amen i really appreciate that he i know
[40:52] he runs around and he does a lot of
[40:55] he does a lot of things
[40:57] and we just appreciate
[40:59] everything that he does
[41:02] it certainly makes it it makes it really
[41:04] nice if ecclesiastes 9 verse 7.
[41:08] now i want you to know how many believe
[41:11] in this life that god intended in this
[41:13] life for you to enjoy
[41:15] the labors of your hands
[41:18] that's all the way through we're not
[41:19] going to take scripture after scripture
[41:21] on this but it's all the way through
[41:22] from the old testament into the new
[41:24] testament and sometimes sometimes the
[41:27] the thought line of is that well a
[41:29] christian is to walk around and this is
[41:31] a christian's life is a is a molly grub
[41:33] that's not a christian's life
[41:35] if you're walking around like that
[41:37] something's missing
[41:38] are you hearing me now listen to me
[41:40] don't walk don't don't say oh no oh i
[41:43] might as well go set in my car no just
[41:45] listen you have a promise as a believer
[41:48] not that things won't come your way but
[41:51] you've gotten a promise an advocate that
[41:54] you can go to the lord jesus and you can
[41:57] ask him restore unto me the joy of thy
[42:01] salvation
[42:03] david never lost it is that right now
[42:06] sometimes the joy can depart when you
[42:08] look in the book of joel joy departed
[42:11] because the people begin to neglect the
[42:14] things that was needed and they had no
[42:18] meat offering no drink offering to bring
[42:20] and to offer up to god you see god does
[42:23] not want you and i coming empty-handed
[42:25] i don't know where this is going god
[42:27] doesn't want us coming empty-handed it
[42:29] ought to be when we show up here to the
[42:31] house of god i know there's times how we
[42:33] need encouragement we need strength but
[42:36] we should be growing as a people and a
[42:38] body of believers that when we are
[42:40] coming together we are coming with the
[42:42] sacrifice of praise we are coming with a
[42:46] meat offering to offer up you know what
[42:48] a meat offering is it's where the grain
[42:50] has come to fruition you say brother
[42:52] samuel well when the grain comes to
[42:54] fruition that'll be a rapture you've got
[42:56] to keep the type in its appropriate
[42:58] place the bible says that in revelations
[43:01] 10 verse 8 that i say unto you you must
[43:04] prophesy again and the word again means
[43:07] a cycle of harvest where you are reaping
[43:10] and you sow back and you reap and you
[43:13] sow back you see there is a continual
[43:16] harvesting that's going on and a sowing
[43:19] back
[43:20] sometimes there's nothing to offer
[43:22] because there's nothing been sewn in
[43:25] is that right
[43:26] i mean you there there it's just like
[43:28] within a service you get into service
[43:30] what you put into it
[43:33] you get even in every part of our life
[43:36] what we put into it my goodness you're
[43:38] getting quiet already
[43:40] but that's good teaching i mean it'll
[43:42] stick to your ribs real tight because
[43:45] many times on you know we we come in we
[43:47] come to a service and we're on my you
[43:49] know the atmosphere here in the
[43:51] atmosphere here but you got to remember
[43:52] you've got to bring down what god is
[43:54] doing and bring it down into your life
[43:58] we cannot just look into the mirror and
[44:00] walk away and forget what we have seen
[44:03] in that mirror let me just tell you
[44:04] something every time that we come to the
[44:06] house of god we come and our
[44:09] shortcomings are exposed if we're really
[44:12] looking correctly but god don't do it in
[44:15] a condemning manner he wants us to grow
[44:17] and to mature and you say how do i grow
[44:20] and i mature we take a good look in the
[44:22] word it's the perfect law of liberty and
[44:25] then we go to god in prayer and if
[44:27] there's things we need to repent of and
[44:28] say god help me to pick this up lord in
[44:31] my life change this in my life don't be
[44:33] ashamed to go to him he ain't ashamed to
[44:36] come down and speak to you and let you
[44:38] know where you need to pick it up at and
[44:41] god is here to minister what we have
[44:43] need of and strengthen our life and make
[44:46] the correction in our life
[44:54] i don't believe in socialism but that
[44:55] was free
[44:57] ecclesiastes 9 7
[44:59] go thy way look how this is rolled i
[45:01] love this this passage go thy way eat
[45:04] thy bread with joy and drink thy wine
[45:07] with a merry heart
[45:09] for god now accepteth thy work so how
[45:12] many know there's nothing like the peace
[45:14] of god
[45:16] you can have everything else in life but
[45:18] if you miss the peace of god you'll
[45:20] never be able to really enjoy the things
[45:23] of life the way you need to
[45:26] are you with me i tell you you've got
[45:28] the peace of god within your life in
[45:30] your heart it'll give you strength to
[45:32] face every adversity it'll give you
[45:34] strength you might have the worst job
[45:36] the boss can put you in the worst place
[45:38] but you've got a peace that passes all
[45:42] understanding
[45:46] my who cares if i'm not accepted
[45:48] anywhere else i'm accepted at home
[45:51] hallelujah for god now accepted thy
[45:53] works let that garments be always white
[45:58] amen unspotted from the world
[46:00] and let thy head lack no
[46:03] ointment
[46:05] oh my so always living and abiding under
[46:08] the anointing of the holy spirit keeping
[46:10] our garments from that of the world
[46:13] how many know your garments when we look
[46:15] at this in the scripture you know your
[46:16] garments when they would walk with the
[46:18] palestinian garments this is the thought
[46:20] remember as they would go along the
[46:21] roads there would be things that could
[46:23] be picked up along the robes but but let
[46:26] not your garments be spotted don't let
[46:28] it remain things sometimes you're around
[46:31] and things get picked up and and
[46:33] collected in our life that you're not
[46:35] even asking for of being collected this
[46:37] is why even when you come home and out
[46:39] of your workplace you need to take a
[46:41] good bath of sanctification and ask god
[46:44] cleanse me lord because there's spirits
[46:47] all around brother and sister spirits of
[46:50] criticism all types of filth and spirits
[46:53] that would like to attach itself to your
[46:56] life and bring anxiousness and
[46:58] everything else but you have a laver you
[47:01] have a privilege to go before almighty
[47:04] god is a priest of god and get a real
[47:07] washing and say lord i receive a washing
[47:11] and a strengthening in my life
[47:14] thanks be to god for the washing of
[47:16] water by the word
[47:18] ecclesiastes 9 9 notice this live
[47:22] joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest
[47:25] all the days of the life of thy vanity
[47:30] which he hath given thee under the sun
[47:33] all the days of divinity for that is thy
[47:36] portion in this life and in thy labor
[47:39] which thou takest under the sun
[47:42] verse 10 whatsoever thy hand find it to
[47:44] do
[47:45] do it with thy might
[47:49] how many remember where paul said
[47:50] whatever you do do it heartily as unto
[47:53] the lord
[47:54] is that right like brother brown when he
[47:56] told billy paul he said if you're going
[47:58] to be the best if you're going to be a
[47:59] bum be the best bum don't work a day in
[48:01] your life sleep in every day and
[48:03] everything else in other words don't do
[48:05] nothing half-heartedly give everything
[48:08] you've got let me just say it like now
[48:10] if you're going to serve god serve him
[48:12] with everything that's within you
[48:16] [Applause]
[48:19] because you've only got one moment one
[48:21] privilege one moment in time
[48:24] whatsoever thy hand find it to do do it
[48:27] with thy might for there is no work nor
[48:30] device nor knowledge nor wisdom in the
[48:33] grave whether thou goest
[48:36] so here in the scripture in verse 9
[48:39] as it is expressing to enjoy
[48:42] that which god
[48:44] has given god has provided there's
[48:46] things that we have labored for with our
[48:48] hands but the laboring remember we
[48:51] recognize that it is god that has given
[48:53] to you and i
[48:54] whether it's skills talents or whatever
[48:56] more and we should never bury a talent
[48:59] in the earth we should always whatever
[49:01] god has given to you and i we should
[49:03] dedicate it to the glory of god brother
[49:05] brown said he'll god will use anything
[49:08] that is sanctified and dedicated to his
[49:11] purpose
[49:12] brother graham said you may not just be
[49:13] able to whistle but if it's dedicated
[49:15] and sanctified to the purpose of
[49:17] almighty god god will use it for his
[49:20] glory
[49:22] so notice here in in this in the
[49:24] scriptures we looked at where it clearly
[49:26] speaks that the wife herself it is a
[49:29] gift from
[49:30] god
[49:31] my that that perspective it changes a
[49:34] lot of things to recognize that the wife
[49:37] herself is a gift from god notice in
[49:40] proverbs 18 22 whoso findeth a wife
[49:44] findeth a good thing now it didn't say
[49:46] whoever finds a woman there's many women
[49:50] but whosoever findeth a wife so this is
[49:52] different than just looking for a woman
[49:54] it's looking for a bride there's a
[49:56] choosing of a bride one that would have
[49:59] this attribute that would be reflected
[50:03] whoso findeth the wife findeth a good
[50:06] thing and obtaineth favor of the lord
[50:11] now thirsting for life brother rem would
[50:12] say it like this many times in many
[50:14] places he says it greatest thing god
[50:17] could give a man outside of salvation
[50:19] was a wife she was to comfort him to
[50:23] help him to bless him to console him and
[50:27] be a real companion to him
[50:31] now we read last time that we were
[50:33] together out of first corinthians 7 32
[50:36] 34 and i'm not going to read from there
[50:38] tonight but i want to refer to that you
[50:40] remember in the scripture where it
[50:41] speaks of
[50:42] those that were unmarried they you know
[50:45] they don't have any distraction or
[50:46] anyone else to care for they're able to
[50:49] attend unto the lord without any
[50:51] distraction there's no other care but
[50:54] whoever is married they themselves not
[50:57] only attending to the lord but must
[50:59] attend their to their spouse
[51:03] the bible says careth for how they might
[51:06] please them is that right now you see in
[51:10] reality when we look at this we
[51:12] recognize that how when the scripture
[51:14] states this there's always a right order
[51:17] in that of in that of pleasing brother
[51:19] brown called this order 1959 in 1963 he
[51:23] called it the order of overcoming and
[51:26] that is god is first your family is
[51:29] second and your last
[51:31] he said that's what jesus did he put
[51:34] himself last when he came here
[51:38] so that's the order of overcoming no
[51:40] matter what we face in life that is the
[51:42] order of overcoming so when god as we
[51:46] read here in the scripture the gift of
[51:47] god or that which findeth a wife that
[51:51] had obtained favor of god god will not
[51:53] give something to a man that would be
[51:56] would mean to replace uh the
[51:58] relationship or to hinder the
[52:01] relationship with him but rather in a
[52:04] real marriage it'll deepen the
[52:06] understanding even within the scripture
[52:09] and it's not necessarily the natural
[52:11] part of it but the spirit of god will
[52:14] work through that experience in our life
[52:17] to deepen that relationship and that
[52:19] care as it is between christ and his
[52:23] bride
[52:24] is that right it will it will deepen
[52:26] that i know you know even after uh
[52:29] my my daddy told me he said when
[52:30] suddenly says once you're married he
[52:32] said you'll find that there will be a
[52:34] deepening he said of the ministry he
[52:37] said there's things that you will begin
[52:38] to understand by experience you've read
[52:41] about you've preached but you will
[52:43] experience it even in a deeper way and
[52:46] there'll be more that even when you're
[52:48] ministering it by the understanding that
[52:50] god has given now i want you to think
[52:52] about this now you know understanding
[52:54] itself is not something we just get
[52:56] handed to us in a book
[52:58] but sometimes understanding comes
[52:59] through trial and error
[53:02] is that right i i know you know it's
[53:04] always kind of comical you know we
[53:06] always think you know how it is uh you
[53:08] know i think about let me just take it
[53:09] like this uh you know i tell you what
[53:12] with paul we were talking about this the
[53:13] other night i think it was you know paul
[53:15] being the firstborn i'll tell you boy he
[53:17] had to have a lot of grace with us he
[53:19] didn't know he had a lot of grace but he
[53:20] did because i tell you i mean we had we
[53:22] had men we had this guy even we had him
[53:24] so dressed up and we took him to the the
[53:26] doctor the first time the doctor said
[53:28] you're burning this boy up it's in july
[53:30] we didn't want him to catch a cold i
[53:32] mean there were so many things we were
[53:34] so tired about when benjamin came along
[53:36] we had now sat down in the lazy boy by
[53:39] the time that zachary came along we
[53:40] weren't just sitting in the lazy boy we
[53:42] already had it reclined and all the way
[53:44] back you know it's something about
[53:46] experiences you actually become more
[53:49] yielded and more resting and more at
[53:52] peace and there's things that you and i
[53:54] could never have known outside
[53:56] of experience there's a lot of things we
[53:58] can read about but you know there's one
[54:00] thing you can't read about and that is
[54:02] the sacrifice that goes with it and even
[54:06] at times when the feelings themselves
[54:08] are not maybe in that order but there's
[54:10] a desire within to fulfill that part and
[54:14] say lord help me in this area so
[54:16] understanding comes with experience you
[54:19] know it would be like me and for the
[54:20] aaron let me use you for an example it'd
[54:22] be like me just pulling you up and
[54:24] trying to say now brother aaron when you
[54:26] go out tomorrow and when you send them
[54:27] guys on the job here's what you really
[54:29] need to do buddy you need to just get
[54:31] them guys and you know tell them to
[54:32] replace that diamond blade you can tell
[54:34] by how i'm talking i don't know a thing
[54:36] of what i'm saying i've heard him talk a
[54:38] little bit about how he has to sign them
[54:40] guys and and you know they're so backed
[54:42] up right now as it is but you know what
[54:44] i have no business even saying nothing
[54:46] to him because i don't have a clue i've
[54:49] only heard him talk about it it'd be
[54:52] like me telling talking to you about
[54:53] siding i've only heard you talk about a
[54:55] little bit are you hearing me you see
[54:57] there's some things that we can hear say
[55:00] but brother when we're right in the
[55:01] midst of it that's when understanding
[55:03] comes let me tell you something god is
[55:06] the omniscient god he knows everything
[55:09] but brother he laid aside his splendor
[55:12] and came down and took up on the robes
[55:14] of earthly humanity that he might
[55:18] understand us
[55:21] oh my so understanding comes through
[55:24] humility
[55:25] through experience so now that same love
[55:28] it'll move and it'll guide see that same
[55:30] love of god that brought him down to
[55:33] earth it now moves in the depths of our
[55:36] lives to move and push our filial love
[55:38] because you don't get rid of filial love
[55:40] that's out there in those outer realms
[55:42] but the agape now sets down to push and
[55:46] move and direct and oversee that feeling
[55:49] of love
[55:50] you see because that feeling of love
[55:53] it's a love of self
[55:57] it is it's a love of self that we we we
[55:59] have to deal with this and battle with
[56:00] this every day
[56:03] well lord i say amen for everybody
[56:07] you know we're right and everybody's
[56:08] wrong
[56:09] i mean we were the only ones that got up
[56:11] on the right side of the bed i don't
[56:12] know what their problem is
[56:15] right
[56:17] offended well i'm not offended everybody
[56:19] else is offended
[56:22] loss is to lose sight of self brother
[56:25] that's one of the greatest victories
[56:27] is to receive that new birth on the
[56:29] inside
[56:30] to where you've completely come to a
[56:32] place of laying down that that that old
[56:35] man to deny the bible said deny oneself
[56:39] you can never take up the cross until
[56:41] you first deny yourself
[56:44] is that right so now the lord jesus has
[56:46] expressed it's daily taking up our cross
[56:49] daily and you see that that's even where
[56:52] it comes down when we're looking at the
[56:54] maturing even within our marriages and
[56:57] the marriage covenant is the losing
[56:59] sight of self to where it's not focused
[57:02] on fulfilling
[57:04] my needs or my wants or my this is it
[57:07] now the objective it becomes on the
[57:10] other person
[57:12] are you hearing me
[57:14] you know the very the very the very
[57:16] first thing well she did this or he did
[57:18] this that's the wrong things
[57:21] because why
[57:22] the scripture tells us we are to strive
[57:25] to accommodate
[57:26] ourselves to the interest of one another
[57:29] and we're talking about in the lord now
[57:31] are you hearing me
[57:33] this is where it's to be at it's not
[57:35] when you stop doing this and you stop
[57:36] doing that this isn't totally that's the
[57:38] wrong focus that that that that's not
[57:40] that's not even the root of the problem
[57:42] the root of the problem is somewhere
[57:44] along the line there's been
[57:45] misunderstanding come in love has gone
[57:48] away brother braham said it just like
[57:49] this when you fall out of divine love
[57:52] with god my if you can fall into divine
[57:55] love then evidently not that you lose it
[57:58] but you can fall out of it under the
[58:00] influence he said then you can't
[58:03] overlook your brother or sister's
[58:05] mistakes
[58:09] i know some of us don't have them
[58:12] but for those of us who have mistakes
[58:14] that was for us
[58:16] ecclesiastes 9 9
[58:18] live joyfully notice this live joyfully
[58:21] with the wife whom thou lovest all the
[58:24] days of thy life of thy vanity
[58:27] which he hath given thee under the sun
[58:30] all the days of thy vanity for that is
[58:31] thy portion in this life and in thy
[58:33] labor which thou takest unto the son so
[58:35] this phrase live joyfully
[58:38] it means to enjoy
[58:41] to enjoy
[58:43] it's and to enjoy this the actual live
[58:46] live and joyfully these words are the
[58:49] very or the come from the very hebrew
[58:51] word
[58:52] where it's used first
[58:54] and and they had life
[58:56] from genesis 1 genesis 2 life it speaks
[59:00] of life
[59:01] life itself
[59:02] you know you can tell sometimes when you
[59:04] can look at a
[59:06] we had a tree out there even behind our
[59:08] house we've got an oak tree and then i
[59:10] got this other tree and we've seen this
[59:11] other tree and my wife pointed it out
[59:13] you know she looked at it she said you
[59:15] know i think that tree is dying and you
[59:16] see the leaves just starting to wither
[59:18] on is there's a big old tree and i
[59:20] looked and said i i don't know i'm
[59:22] hoping it's not dying and she's looking
[59:24] at it i think it's dying
[59:26] and sure enough it's dying
[59:29] now what was the evidence you start
[59:32] seeing the leaves
[59:34] the leaves themselves start folding in
[59:37] like this
[59:38] is that right
[59:39] you know how it is even with certain
[59:42] plants and things around your house
[59:44] you have to forgive me i can only pull
[59:45] as god brings it to me but different
[59:47] things that we would plant whether it's
[59:49] you know at times with uh we have
[59:51] planted hydrangeas and some of you know
[59:53] with that them nice pretty uh sometimes
[59:55] the white flowers and things that come
[59:56] out on the bushes but you know those
[59:58] things even when you first plant them
[1:00:00] they require a lot of care
[1:00:02] they'll get droopy if you don't water
[1:00:04] them and when they get droopy you know
[1:00:06] it's time to water them
[1:00:08] now you look at them and you think oh my
[1:00:10] goodness i've messed this plant up no
[1:00:12] all they need is water
[1:00:14] that's all they need
[1:00:16] and then you start finding out that now
[1:00:18] that has to come until they get
[1:00:20] established
[1:00:22] now i don't mean that i still don't have
[1:00:23] to water them it's just the watering
[1:00:25] itself the roots have grown deeper no
[1:00:27] wonder god would say even in the old
[1:00:30] testament when a man was first married
[1:00:32] not even to let him go out to battle but
[1:00:34] go and and rejoice and delight thyself
[1:00:37] with the wife of thy youth no wonder god
[1:00:39] would place that in the word not that it
[1:00:41] ever should grow old but there's a
[1:00:43] necessary part to establishing that and
[1:00:46] a continual watering thereafter
[1:00:50] is that right there were things that
[1:00:51] came up you know we had some we planted
[1:00:53] some trees last year and
[1:00:55] some of them trees as they came up
[1:00:57] you know you start looking at different
[1:00:59] things and i i never dealt with these
[1:01:00] trees before some of you probably know
[1:01:02] i'm talking about them arbor vita trees
[1:01:03] or whatever and uh you start looking at
[1:01:06] them and immediately you know you say oh
[1:01:07] my goodness you know here here is a
[1:01:09] brown here's a brown leaf come up on it
[1:01:12] or i don't know how you call it a leaf
[1:01:13] or whatever it is and it comes up on i
[1:01:15] said oh my goodness i said honey take a
[1:01:17] picture of that and and go ask them
[1:01:19] people what it is we need to put in
[1:01:21] there you know because you you if you
[1:01:22] pull it up on dr google there's
[1:01:24] everybody in there and their mother
[1:01:26] that's got some kind of opinion you know
[1:01:28] stand on your head and spit nickels on
[1:01:30] it or what and everybody has all kinds
[1:01:32] of stuff so you want to go and find out
[1:01:34] from somebody who really knows what
[1:01:35] they're talking about so you're not
[1:01:37] buying a bunch of penny and nickel stuff
[1:01:39] you everybody know i'm talking about so
[1:01:41] you want to go to these things and you
[1:01:43] and so she looked at it and come to find
[1:01:45] out there were certain things that
[1:01:46] during that time of the year it's a time
[1:01:48] to fertilize and there's certain
[1:01:49] fertilizer it needs to go in the ground
[1:01:51] you say what in the world does this have
[1:01:53] to do with ever with this at all well
[1:01:55] i'll tell you what it has to do with it
[1:01:57] there is things now that you don't have
[1:01:59] to ask me at a certain time of the year
[1:02:01] every so many months i go out there and
[1:02:03] i fertilize and throw in that holly tone
[1:02:06] and those things underneath them trees
[1:02:08] so that it will actually leach down into
[1:02:10] the ground and so it takes away that
[1:02:11] yellowness but you know what my i don't
[1:02:13] want to wait till that yellowness comes
[1:02:15] back i've already seen it one time so i
[1:02:17] want to make sure it has the right
[1:02:19] nutrients this is how it is even in
[1:02:22] marriages we do not want to wait till
[1:02:24] there's yellowness and other things come
[1:02:26] by but we want to take that once we find
[1:02:29] out this is the nutrients that's needed
[1:02:31] we want to sow those nutrients that's
[1:02:33] the same way in our spiritual life not
[1:02:36] wait until there's times of yellowness
[1:02:38] or dryness but we realize we need the
[1:02:41] refreshing and the renewing of the holy
[1:02:43] spirit the nutrients in our lives and he
[1:02:46] understands that and he's more than
[1:02:49] willing to provide for our life
[1:02:51] because he enjoys
[1:02:54] doing that
[1:02:56] so it's to enjoy
[1:02:58] this living joyfully to enjoy
[1:03:01] one another
[1:03:02] enjoy one another's company
[1:03:05] to find the joy
[1:03:07] the joy in serving
[1:03:10] you know paul would even write about how
[1:03:12] that
[1:03:13] that they were helpers
[1:03:15] of the joy among the believers in
[1:03:17] thessalonica
[1:03:19] the bible says in ephesians 5 21 for no
[1:03:22] man ever yet hated
[1:03:24] his own flesh
[1:03:26] but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as
[1:03:28] the lord the church
[1:03:31] so to think of how that through that
[1:03:34] union
[1:03:36] with with god
[1:03:37] and how that paul would write of this as
[1:03:40] god would bring it down to where
[1:03:42] that a man and woman brother brandon
[1:03:44] remember he ties it that those spirits
[1:03:46] that were made back there before the
[1:03:48] foundation of the world
[1:03:50] that when a man and a woman would come
[1:03:53] together here and they're united here
[1:03:55] upon this earth though you see two
[1:03:57] people
[1:03:58] but it's actually those spirits that are
[1:04:01] uniting together because you could look
[1:04:03] and say i don't see one flesh i see two
[1:04:06] people but it's actually the spirits
[1:04:08] that are uniting together
[1:04:11] that that male and that feminist spirit
[1:04:13] it's uniting together just like it did
[1:04:16] right back there in the garden of eden
[1:04:18] when god himself performed the first
[1:04:20] marriage ceremony so then the reality is
[1:04:22] is that for the man when he would look
[1:04:25] there at his wife and to regard her as
[1:04:28] his own flesh just as much as if you
[1:04:30] know i would be careful with my with my
[1:04:33] hand you know when you're pounding in
[1:04:34] nails i remember smashed your thumb
[1:04:38] you have the best of you have done that
[1:04:39] one huh
[1:04:40] and you do that and you know you don't
[1:04:42] say
[1:04:42] come on man get over it
[1:04:45] come on no most of the time ow
[1:04:48] oh
[1:04:49] depending on how hard it was you know
[1:04:51] oh why you you there there's a thumb and
[1:04:54] the thumb itself there's there's a
[1:04:56] trigger because there's been a hurt that
[1:04:59] has happened and it's part of your body
[1:05:02] and nobody had to send you a public
[1:05:04] service announcement to know your
[1:05:05] thumb's been
[1:05:07] hit right you didn't have no no thing go
[1:05:10] off on your phone at night
[1:05:13] a yellow car has driven away with you
[1:05:14] know you didn't have none of those
[1:05:16] alerts you failed it
[1:05:18] right
[1:05:19] i mean you're that one with your thumb
[1:05:22] you felt it
[1:05:23] and so what do you do like when you get
[1:05:26] a pain in your body what do you do when
[1:05:27] you get a pain in your body you try to
[1:05:29] find a way of comfort to relieve that
[1:05:33] pain
[1:05:34] right i mean whether you take tylenol or
[1:05:37] motrin or you say brother samuel i pray
[1:05:39] okay we pray and take tylenol and take
[1:05:42] motrin don't try to get spiritual on me
[1:05:46] so you understand what i'm saying
[1:05:48] so there's what are we doing we don't
[1:05:50] like feeling discomfort we don't like
[1:05:52] feeling that we try to do what we can
[1:05:54] ain't that right brother mark we try to
[1:05:56] do that so here paul is writing on their
[1:05:59] inspiration that that's exactly how god
[1:06:02] ministers to you and i aren't you glad
[1:06:04] how god will come right around and
[1:06:06] minister to our lives i so appreciate it
[1:06:08] this past weekend how god came in such a
[1:06:12] very personal and precise way and
[1:06:15] ministered to our needs just what we had
[1:06:18] need of to encourage us and the right
[1:06:20] things and discourage us in the wrong
[1:06:22] things you know what he's doing he's
[1:06:24] ministering to our needs as a body
[1:06:26] aren't you glad when you're down he'll
[1:06:28] come and he'll minister he's
[1:06:30] not something that you're way off he
[1:06:32] senses it the bible says he is moved
[1:06:36] touched by the feeling
[1:06:38] of our infirmities
[1:06:40] you know what that tells me he's a
[1:06:42] sensitive god
[1:06:43] [Applause]
[1:06:45] and he's attentive to our needs
[1:06:48] is that right
[1:06:50] oh my i tell you when we can look at
[1:06:52] that and you say brother samuel i can
[1:06:54] never live up to that when we're not
[1:06:56] expecting god's not expecting us to be
[1:06:58] god but if we can just say lord how you
[1:07:01] reflect yourself lord and show your love
[1:07:04] to me let me be that yielding lord god
[1:07:07] to let that my life be a reflection and
[1:07:10] a channel that can minister that
[1:07:12] inspiration right here as it is in
[1:07:15] heaven so let it be in earth
[1:07:18] hallelujah our body we you know we
[1:07:20] address it when it's in pain and
[1:07:22] everything else and you think of how
[1:07:24] that paul would write it that that
[1:07:25] nourisheth and cherisheth it
[1:07:28] and you know because this goes on to say
[1:07:30] even as the lord the church
[1:07:33] you see
[1:07:35] how god himself he never hated us
[1:07:40] he never ever hated us
[1:07:43] there are times that there's you know
[1:07:44] there's a difference between anger and
[1:07:46] hatred
[1:07:48] is that right
[1:07:49] the bible would say let not the sun go
[1:07:52] down
[1:07:53] on your wrath
[1:07:55] is that right let it not go down
[1:07:57] make it right clear it out
[1:08:00] is that right
[1:08:02] so when we look at this
[1:08:04] we recognize there are times
[1:08:06] that how many know that there are times
[1:08:08] that god he's had to correct us
[1:08:12] there's times that god his presence
[1:08:13] would pull back from our life
[1:08:16] it isn't that he desires to do that but
[1:08:19] his presence pulling back from our life
[1:08:21] is that you and i might be able to
[1:08:23] recognize
[1:08:24] wait a minute wait a minute something's
[1:08:26] wrong here his presence isn't here in my
[1:08:30] life the way it needs to be i tell you
[1:08:32] if a person can walk by in their life
[1:08:34] and they are absent of the presence of
[1:08:35] god and it don't matter to them that's a
[1:08:37] sad shape
[1:08:39] because the greatest company that we can
[1:08:41] ever have is the company of the holy
[1:08:44] ghost amen and to have the fellowship of
[1:08:46] the holy spirit in our life and and
[1:08:49] walking with us and speaking to us
[1:08:51] guiding us directing us and ministering
[1:08:54] to our needs so there there is the
[1:08:56] leadership of god of how that in our
[1:08:59] lives he comes and he ministers he
[1:09:02] ministers he nourishes he cherishes us
[1:09:05] now in colossians 3 18
[1:09:07] let me just move to 319 for just
[1:09:10] um
[1:09:11] of the sake of scripture
[1:09:14] husbands
[1:09:15] love your wives and be not bitter
[1:09:18] against them
[1:09:20] now when all we read about all here in
[1:09:23] the scripture
[1:09:24] let me just say this to you paul is not
[1:09:27] writing this to a bunch of unbelievers
[1:09:30] he's not writing this to a bunch of make
[1:09:32] believers
[1:09:33] paul never said you know what i wouldn't
[1:09:35] have to touch none of this if you all
[1:09:37] just got the holy ghost
[1:09:40] preach brother samuel
[1:09:42] you see there's a balance when we talk
[1:09:44] about the automatic of the fruit of the
[1:09:46] holy spirit living out of our life
[1:09:50] but brother every day is a day of
[1:09:52] overcoming
[1:09:54] there's things you see in your life
[1:09:56] right now you didn't see last year but
[1:09:58] the spirit of god points it out why it's
[1:10:01] a jericho for waltz to come down it
[1:10:04] might be ai coming up it's a city that
[1:10:07] you have been commissioned to take it
[1:10:09] down because the baptism of the holy
[1:10:11] ghost is the land of overcoming
[1:10:16] is that right
[1:10:18] it's where overcomers
[1:10:20] are made manifest by the indwelling of
[1:10:22] the overcoming life
[1:10:27] glory whether it's sickness with trial
[1:10:28] whatever it might be notice husbands
[1:10:30] love your wives and be not bitter
[1:10:32] against them you know
[1:10:35] it's like like in this way of that of
[1:10:37] that bitterness of where i like how john
[1:10:39] gill john gill's an ancient uh you know
[1:10:41] commentary that how that he would write
[1:10:43] of this and look at it and just to pull
[1:10:45] that part out about bitter and he deals
[1:10:47] with how that it's not ruling with a
[1:10:49] rigor and tyrannical manner or behaving
[1:10:51] towards them in a you know in an
[1:10:53] ill-natured way or giving them bitter
[1:10:55] words
[1:10:56] or or denying them now notice what this
[1:10:58] happens instead not just not just doing
[1:11:01] the things that that would be wrong or
[1:11:04] displeasing now listen to me
[1:11:07] these are things it's evident when the
[1:11:09] spirit of god would move upon paul to
[1:11:11] write this he knows that in the marriage
[1:11:15] covenant and not so much to covenant but
[1:11:17] within a marriage that you have two
[1:11:19] people
[1:11:20] and there are two people that sometimes
[1:11:22] you're going to think differently
[1:11:25] sometimes you got two people i know this
[1:11:27] is news breaking news that have
[1:11:29] different temperaments different makeups
[1:11:33] sometimes they both the same way and
[1:11:35] they drive one another nuts but you
[1:11:37] understand there's things when we look
[1:11:39] at it here paul was writing knowing
[1:11:42] these things would be there by the
[1:11:44] spirit of almighty god you see what the
[1:11:46] holy ghost does through the word he puts
[1:11:49] things before you and i and and and in
[1:11:52] his word so that we might give ourselves
[1:11:55] to him and say yes lord this is what an
[1:11:58] overcoming life looks like
[1:12:01] how many know a picture is worth a
[1:12:02] thousand words
[1:12:04] is that right
[1:12:05] so you know a person can say oh i'm this
[1:12:08] i'm that a picture's worth a thousand
[1:12:10] words
[1:12:11] this is where the rubber meets the road
[1:12:15] paul was letting them know yeah in
[1:12:16] ephesians one chosen in class before the
[1:12:19] foundational world my they were shouting
[1:12:21] glory to god hallelujah i've been
[1:12:23] predestinated and he gets to ephesians 5
[1:12:25] and they know now
[1:12:28] but i believe as believers they were
[1:12:30] looking at that and there's something in
[1:12:32] the heart that says lord mold me and
[1:12:34] shake me this is an area of my life i
[1:12:37] need to grow here i need to overcome it
[1:12:40] why there's an overcoming life within
[1:12:42] the inside
[1:12:45] but notice not just giving them you know
[1:12:47] bitter words or exchanges are or this or
[1:12:50] that or curt gestures or whatever but it
[1:12:53] can also be denying them
[1:12:56] their affection or their care or their
[1:12:58] provision
[1:13:01] or using
[1:13:02] them so we all fail
[1:13:05] and disappoint one another
[1:13:09] isn't that right
[1:13:10] brother branham when he talks about even
[1:13:12] voting in officers
[1:13:14] okay
[1:13:15] he talks about it in
[1:13:16] um total total deliverance faith is a
[1:13:19] victory super sense messages that are
[1:13:22] not even church order brother brandon
[1:13:23] will lay in a lot of the things with
[1:13:25] officers voting officers in and brother
[1:13:27] brown would make him make a mention like
[1:13:28] that he said now i want you to remember
[1:13:30] he said these these are your deacons
[1:13:34] and he said they will make mistakes
[1:13:36] but they're your deacons
[1:13:39] now we ain't just picking on the deacons
[1:13:41] pastor
[1:13:42] trustees anybody else just as much you
[1:13:45] know it's different when they're up here
[1:13:47] playing you say wrong note
[1:13:50] oh wrong note how many wrong notes have
[1:13:51] we hit
[1:13:56] oh lord help us
[1:13:58] see we fail and we disappoint one
[1:14:00] another
[1:14:03] is that right
[1:14:04] this is where this is where we
[1:14:06] misunderstand one another
[1:14:09] nobody likes to be misunderstood
[1:14:12] but yet we can frequently misunderstand
[1:14:16] is that right
[1:14:18] this is where brother branham would
[1:14:19] express it in this way
[1:14:21] in uh questions and answers part three
[1:14:23] he said understand talk to your wife now
[1:14:26] brother-in-law's talking about relations
[1:14:27] and things here as well i'm not going to
[1:14:28] go into the whole quote tonight if one
[1:14:30] nature is to you and another nature to
[1:14:32] her talk it with her
[1:14:35] talk it with her i don't think it said
[1:14:38] text it
[1:14:40] nope nope
[1:14:41] then say text to her sit across the
[1:14:43] living room or across the dining room
[1:14:45] table and text her
[1:14:48] you know texting has re replaced
[1:14:50] communication
[1:14:53] preach brother samuel
[1:14:58] i'm telling you you try to do the same
[1:15:00] thing to him sister understand one
[1:15:03] another and be a real christian
[1:15:05] gentleman and real christian ladies and
[1:15:07] brother and sister with one another
[1:15:09] always remember this is very important
[1:15:12] always remember you're god's children
[1:15:14] you're from a royal family you're a
[1:15:16] royal blood there's no better blood in
[1:15:18] the world than yours that's right a real
[1:15:21] royal blood shows itself that's what it
[1:15:24] is it's royal all that believe it say
[1:15:27] amen
[1:15:30] yes sir show what you are i'm a son of a
[1:15:33] king i'm the son of a king my wife's a
[1:15:35] daughter of the king how would i treat
[1:15:37] the king's daughter how should she treat
[1:15:39] the king's son see what i mean be real
[1:15:42] genuine
[1:15:44] so nourishes no man ever hated his own
[1:15:47] flesh but nourishes and carefully
[1:15:50] protects and cherishes it
[1:15:53] so just as much as the nourishment
[1:15:57] you know
[1:15:59] nourishment we all need nourishment in
[1:16:00] our bodies is that right
[1:16:05] i mean if
[1:16:06] you know how it is
[1:16:08] you don't get nourishment
[1:16:11] they don't call it hungry they call it
[1:16:13] hangry yeah
[1:16:17] it's about
[1:16:18] lunchtime
[1:16:21] you know what i mean you look and say ah
[1:16:23] that ain't damn they just they need
[1:16:24] something to eat
[1:16:27] there's sugar dropping or this what you
[1:16:29] need nourishment is that right
[1:16:31] sometimes you you go without eating you
[1:16:33] get a headache
[1:16:34] you know what i'm talking about
[1:16:36] what is it it's a part of your body
[1:16:37] that's letting you know hey you're
[1:16:39] without something you need nourishment
[1:16:43] is that right that's the same what paul
[1:16:45] is dealing with there is a need for
[1:16:47] nourishment now from the looks of us we
[1:16:49] don't have a lot of problems with that
[1:16:51] so we need in our own natural body but
[1:16:53] the nourishment of how that paul would
[1:16:55] deal with this of how that it would be
[1:16:58] that that that should be within that of
[1:17:00] a marriage a nourishing of that where
[1:17:03] there's a nourishing you know in reality
[1:17:05] if you can look at this in the right way
[1:17:07] it's actually the care of the husband
[1:17:09] that'll further bring forth the wife out
[1:17:11] of the woman
[1:17:15] hey who brought the mystery out of your
[1:17:17] life that you were part of the bride of
[1:17:19] jesus christ
[1:17:20] who brought that out
[1:17:22] not a church didn't do that
[1:17:25] rules didn't do that
[1:17:27] come on now you remember as a young
[1:17:29] person rules don't do that it takes our
[1:17:32] love affair a personal experience a
[1:17:36] contact with the lord jesus himself
[1:17:41] he's the one that brought that out of
[1:17:43] our life it's the water of life that
[1:17:46] came from that seed to come into this
[1:17:49] seed to bring the nourishment to bring
[1:17:52] it to life
[1:17:54] hallelujah that's why we couldn't fit
[1:17:56] into any other church why the mystery in
[1:17:58] our life was to be a part of the bride
[1:18:01] of jesus christ and only the bridegroom
[1:18:03] appearing himself can release that and
[1:18:06] draw it and bring it into a reality
[1:18:09] it's the same thing the complimentary
[1:18:11] nourishing between a husband and a wife
[1:18:14] you see
[1:18:15] to cherish something
[1:18:17] is to provide a tender
[1:18:20] care a warmth to it no wonder god would
[1:18:22] say
[1:18:23] in there in the beginning that that that
[1:18:25] that a man shall leave his father and
[1:18:27] his mother and shall cleave
[1:18:30] unto his wife
[1:18:32] be the warmth be that which which
[1:18:34] fosters that part to to keep it in a
[1:18:37] place that it's receptive
[1:18:40] it's very important i want you to think
[1:18:41] about this with abraham
[1:18:43] who was it when we look at abraham god
[1:18:46] provided the nourishment
[1:18:48] that was needed for abraham to grow
[1:18:51] i mean if you look back in chapter 12
[1:18:53] you know abraham abram
[1:18:56] hard times
[1:18:58] hard times you you go down to egypt
[1:19:02] right right
[1:19:04] but then you find in genesis 13 got god
[1:19:07] allows situations to come up there's a
[1:19:09] separation a lot goes his way abraham
[1:19:11] sees the need for that and then here
[1:19:13] comes abram and god says rise up and
[1:19:15] i'll show you east west north south you
[1:19:17] understand it keeps on going
[1:19:19] but emperor abraham's growing the growth
[1:19:22] within abram was because of the
[1:19:24] nourishment that god was providing to
[1:19:28] him
[1:19:30] this is where this is why for you and i
[1:19:32] we are not a product of our own doing
[1:19:35] salvation is of the lord
[1:19:38] it is a product of his nourishment to
[1:19:40] our life
[1:19:42] he knows what you and i have need of he
[1:19:44] nourishes you and i because his desire
[1:19:47] is to see his own image being reflected
[1:19:50] in our life
[1:19:52] so he nourishes us with his word
[1:19:55] by his spirit is that right
[1:19:59] now i want you to understand this here
[1:20:00] don't misunderstand me when i say this
[1:20:02] but there's a maturing a growing into
[1:20:06] a becoming of a husband a wife father or
[1:20:08] mother than just an entrance into a
[1:20:10] marriage or receiving the blessing of
[1:20:12] children
[1:20:13] it requires continual nourishing and
[1:20:16] cherishing through the journey
[1:20:19] i think the example that the holy spirit
[1:20:21] had made he used before when we were
[1:20:22] talking about paul and our kids and
[1:20:24] things like that there's things that
[1:20:25] even now that you know to be able to
[1:20:27] understand as a husband and wife to
[1:20:29] understand one another better in in a
[1:20:32] better way to to to minister to one
[1:20:34] another there are there's a maturing
[1:20:37] that takes place within our life by the
[1:20:39] same are you saying maturing doesn't
[1:20:40] mean that we don't make mistakes i
[1:20:41] didn't say that are you saying maturing
[1:20:43] brother samuel it means that we don't
[1:20:45] disappoint one another i ain't saying
[1:20:46] that i'm talking about maturing itself
[1:20:49] is where that within our lives we
[1:20:52] recognize that within these things it's
[1:20:55] a nourishment that brings maturing you
[1:20:58] plant something or you have something
[1:21:00] out there that you know you put out in
[1:21:02] the garden or whatever more if you don't
[1:21:03] feed it and you don't water it and you
[1:21:05] don't put it in light it ain't gonna
[1:21:07] grow don't blame the plant
[1:21:11] are you with me and the other thing is
[1:21:13] there's certain plants you know azaleas
[1:21:15] and things like that there's certain
[1:21:16] plants that you grow you take hydrangeas
[1:21:19] you take different ones there's a
[1:21:20] certain ph in that soil every soil you
[1:21:23] might say man that all soil it's all
[1:21:25] dirt but there is a certain ph that must
[1:21:28] be present in order for that plant to
[1:21:32] provide its full potential
[1:21:35] and if the ph level is not right if it's
[1:21:37] too acidic you've got to bring it back
[1:21:39] to a neutral if it's too uh you know
[1:21:42] neutral and it needs more acidic like
[1:21:44] azaleas do you're gonna have to add that
[1:21:46] into the soil because that's what's
[1:21:49] needed in order to make it flourish you
[1:21:52] say how do you know that you've got to
[1:21:54] read the label
[1:21:56] come on now that's the same thing it is
[1:21:58] with those naturally god never meant for
[1:22:01] it to be it would be something of guests
[1:22:03] here and guests there you can know
[1:22:05] whether acid needs to be added or this
[1:22:07] needs to be added brother you you know
[1:22:10] there's things that you know your wife
[1:22:12] can tell you
[1:22:13] and you realize man this ain't hitting
[1:22:14] the mark
[1:22:16] whoo i mean you just think man this is
[1:22:18] this is bullseye
[1:22:21] it ain't bullseye
[1:22:23] so what do i do well you got to get a
[1:22:24] better gun no how about just go talk to
[1:22:26] the person who knows where the target's
[1:22:27] at and the bulls eyes at
[1:22:29] come on somebody brother samuel i'll go
[1:22:32] read a book save your time
[1:22:34] go go go talk to the professor
[1:22:39] hallelujah i mean you know otherwise you
[1:22:41] need to get somebody else's opinion for
[1:22:43] it
[1:22:47] let me try to let me try to come down
[1:22:49] here
[1:22:50] let me have just a few more moments
[1:22:53] so the great care
[1:22:56] within the within a marriage
[1:22:59] of how that even god
[1:23:01] would care and he nourishes our life
[1:23:04] even to where we're at right now
[1:23:07] god continues to provide the nourishment
[1:23:11] that's needed
[1:23:13] for right now
[1:23:15] just like when you hear you look at how
[1:23:17] that god will take
[1:23:19] in a service
[1:23:20] and how god will come and he'll certain
[1:23:23] things will be spoken and sometimes god
[1:23:24] will take a service and he'll deal with
[1:23:26] trials deal with tests and i mean how
[1:23:28] many times how many times have we heard
[1:23:31] messages on trials how many times have i
[1:23:34] preached messages on trials
[1:23:37] not only here but other places and you
[1:23:39] know god would but there's
[1:23:41] how how many times even in other other
[1:23:44] you know other needs and things that
[1:23:46] arise and so forth but god
[1:23:48] is ever mindful
[1:23:50] the bible says that the eyes of the lord
[1:23:52] run to and fro
[1:23:54] is that right so when we come to the
[1:23:56] house of god this is why sometimes it
[1:23:58] almost takes your breath away when you
[1:24:00] begin to realize
[1:24:01] he don't this man don't know me
[1:24:03] this is god
[1:24:05] because even though we know one another
[1:24:07] i'm talking about just being you even
[1:24:09] though we know one another but god
[1:24:12] knows the very thoughts of our heart
[1:24:16] you see god is so attentive
[1:24:19] to our needs
[1:24:21] to minister to what we have need of
[1:24:25] let me read just a few scriptures and
[1:24:26] then we'll we'll just close here
[1:24:29] how it refers
[1:24:31] in in deuteronomy uh chapter 11 i love
[1:24:34] these verses of scripture when it talks
[1:24:35] about the land and the watering
[1:24:37] you know in egypt they had to carry the
[1:24:39] water from one place
[1:24:40] to another they had to transport it but
[1:24:43] god let him know here if i can just jump
[1:24:46] straight to verse 12
[1:24:48] but god let him know this is a land
[1:24:52] which the lord thy god careth for
[1:24:56] when you hear when you think of land
[1:24:57] what is land it's where seed sown
[1:25:00] right
[1:25:01] in the in the scripture where it says
[1:25:03] and god put the man whom he had formed
[1:25:05] into the garden the word garden means
[1:25:07] bride
[1:25:09] a land which the lord thy god careth for
[1:25:12] the eyes of the lord thy god are always
[1:25:15] upon it from the beginning of the year
[1:25:17] even unto the end of the year his eyes
[1:25:20] are always upon it
[1:25:21] he's the one caring for it
[1:25:23] he's attentive to the land aren't you
[1:25:26] glad he's attentive to your life
[1:25:28] aren't you glad he knows just exactly
[1:25:30] what you and i we have need of and not
[1:25:32] just knows it but he ministers to you
[1:25:34] and i
[1:25:36] you ministers to you and i and you know
[1:25:38] sometimes let me just say something let
[1:25:40] me tell you something about him that's
[1:25:42] so precious
[1:25:43] he knows sometimes even though he knows
[1:25:45] what we need and he'll come to minister
[1:25:47] to it but he knows sometimes we're not
[1:25:50] really in the right humor maybe to
[1:25:51] receive it
[1:25:54] this is not even here we're just going
[1:25:56] to go with this and we'll close
[1:25:58] he knows that we're not maybe in the
[1:25:59] right humor to receive it
[1:26:02] so it ain't going to do no good to just
[1:26:04] sow it if the ground's not available to
[1:26:06] receive it
[1:26:08] so he must work on that ground
[1:26:11] so that it comes into a place
[1:26:14] of reception
[1:26:16] it might be through the toils of life
[1:26:18] it might be through things that are
[1:26:19] going through heartaches disappointments
[1:26:22] even questions of why or or things
[1:26:24] that's come about hey look elisha was
[1:26:27] not in a good humor
[1:26:30] is that right prophet of god an ordained
[1:26:33] channel of god to receive divine
[1:26:35] inspiration
[1:26:36] that would address the circumstance
[1:26:38] but because he was angry
[1:26:42] the channel was not available
[1:26:44] are you with me
[1:26:46] but elisha oh i love this boy elisha was
[1:26:49] a mature son of god he didn't say high
[1:26:51] and angry i ain't oh you know it's you
[1:26:52] hit you it's you making me better no
[1:26:54] it's you it's your fault no no he was a
[1:26:55] mature son of god
[1:26:57] i'm angry
[1:26:58] we'll give me a minstrel
[1:27:00] put some gospel music on we got to
[1:27:02] change this atmosphere who needs to be
[1:27:04] changed i do
[1:27:06] i need to be changed see this is what
[1:27:08] mature sons and daughters of god do that
[1:27:11] can look in the word and the word can
[1:27:13] show our shortcomings show what we have
[1:27:15] need of and we're not trying to shove it
[1:27:16] off or pass the buck on somebody else we
[1:27:19] see that lord i need my atmosphere
[1:27:23] changed
[1:27:26] that's taking responsibility
[1:27:28] glory be to god he is attentive to what
[1:27:32] you and i
[1:27:33] have need of
[1:27:35] in first samuel i'm closing
[1:27:39] you remember hannah's husband elkin
[1:27:42] remember
[1:27:44] here and he had another
[1:27:46] had another wife
[1:27:48] well i had two of them i don't know but
[1:27:50] he had another one
[1:27:53] and she had she had
[1:27:56] a lot of sons
[1:27:58] but hannah didn't have any
[1:28:01] hannah was barren
[1:28:03] right
[1:28:04] that bothered her
[1:28:06] she wept because of it you know why
[1:28:09] her desire was not to be barren
[1:28:12] she wanted to bear alcana a son
[1:28:15] a child
[1:28:17] see that that's where that's where the
[1:28:19] delight was is to bear a child you
[1:28:20] realize right now i don't even know how
[1:28:22] we're getting on this but do you realize
[1:28:24] there's a
[1:28:25] um
[1:28:26] there's an article i may speak on this a
[1:28:27] little bit at one point but
[1:28:29] there's an article that just was was put
[1:28:31] out here a few weeks ago and i looked at
[1:28:33] it
[1:28:34] where you find the young generation
[1:28:35] that's coming on right now and i'm
[1:28:36] saying young i'm not talking about 18
[1:28:38] years old i'm talking about 27 and on to
[1:28:40] 30 or whatever more where they're
[1:28:41] looking and they're already making plans
[1:28:43] we're not having children
[1:28:45] the scripture says
[1:28:48] it would come to that spot where they
[1:28:49] would say blessed are the paps that
[1:28:51] never gave suck and the wombs that never
[1:28:54] bear is that right that's end-time
[1:28:56] prophecy
[1:28:58] this is this is this is a an article
[1:29:01] that is right out there and they're
[1:29:02] interviewing the people and these
[1:29:04] individuals are you know what hey we
[1:29:06] don't want it we don't want to be
[1:29:07] bothered with it they're just right out
[1:29:08] on us with it they don't want to be
[1:29:10] bothered with it but you see
[1:29:12] it's within
[1:29:15] a woman a man and how that god will
[1:29:17] bring that about the fruit
[1:29:19] of their union think about hannah here
[1:29:21] this is what i want you to think about
[1:29:22] his attentiveness
[1:29:24] and that attentiveness
[1:29:26] of the husband
[1:29:29] elkanah sees what's going he sees
[1:29:32] and he's seeing this with anna
[1:29:35] with hannah sorry in verse 8. then
[1:29:38] elkanah
[1:29:39] her husband said to her hannah
[1:29:41] why weepest thou
[1:29:44] and why edith thou not
[1:29:46] and why is thy heart grief what is this
[1:29:48] he's attentive
[1:29:52] you see the cares of life let me just
[1:29:54] say this the cares of life
[1:29:56] life
[1:29:57] is life
[1:29:59] and do you know how it is there's
[1:30:01] sometimes where you just don't feel like
[1:30:02] you've got enough time in the day
[1:30:05] is that right hey listen moses dealt
[1:30:07] with that too
[1:30:09] it came time moses was so busy
[1:30:12] with what god had called him to do with
[1:30:13] the exodus
[1:30:15] that he forgot to circumcise his own boy
[1:30:19] is that right he forgot the very sign of
[1:30:21] the covenant
[1:30:23] you see things that we can become so
[1:30:25] busy with so i give that example as it
[1:30:26] comes to me it's not necessarily busy
[1:30:29] sometimes with the wrong things it's
[1:30:31] just simply that's
[1:30:32] busy
[1:30:34] this is why when brother you know when
[1:30:36] it comes down to let me just say like
[1:30:37] this it's always a litmus test
[1:30:40] if you don't have time to be in the
[1:30:42] house of god to read and to pray you're
[1:30:44] too busy
[1:30:46] we're too busy brother brown would tell
[1:30:48] us as ministers over and over the
[1:30:49] message influence voice of god in this
[1:30:51] last days over and over ministers don't
[1:30:54] ever get yourself too busy
[1:30:57] to where you can't get alone and hear
[1:31:00] god's voice now i don't believe that
[1:31:03] applies to ministers but i believe that
[1:31:04] applies to every one of us
[1:31:06] because satan's desires to get us so
[1:31:08] busy
[1:31:09] and the scripture talks about remember
[1:31:11] the seed being sown even in one place of
[1:31:14] it that even to where the cares of this
[1:31:16] life i understand we all understand
[1:31:18] there's times sometimes we go through
[1:31:20] weeks there's times there's seasons and
[1:31:22] things like that that things can you
[1:31:24] know go on whether it's here at the
[1:31:25] church or in your in your in in times in
[1:31:28] your job and things like that where you
[1:31:30] know things turn into from eight to 12
[1:31:32] hour days to seem like around the clock
[1:31:34] on something you think my lord if we can
[1:31:37] just get out of this season and you know
[1:31:39] it's a season lord give me strength but
[1:31:41] you see this is why in the other seasons
[1:31:44] it's a time to store up
[1:31:49] are you with me it's a time to store up
[1:31:52] because there's going to be times in our
[1:31:54] life that we need that stored up
[1:31:58] in our life
[1:32:00] now that don't mean i want you to come
[1:32:02] in and say i'm going to come every day
[1:32:04] for church so i can you know be gone for
[1:32:05] a month no don't take it down don't take
[1:32:08] it that way you understand what i'm
[1:32:09] saying
[1:32:10] we have to we understand that that's a
[1:32:12] principle now notice this he says
[1:32:15] am not i better to thee
[1:32:17] than ten sons
[1:32:20] my
[1:32:22] now the other one was provoking or the
[1:32:24] other the other wife was provoking her
[1:32:26] he took knowledge he took notice of this
[1:32:29] was going on his attentiveness and he
[1:32:31] speaks to her am i not better than 10
[1:32:33] sons now she's not going to say to him
[1:32:35] oh no
[1:32:36] you're terrible you're this no you know
[1:32:38] what it was his affection his care
[1:32:42] all of that
[1:32:43] to care for her
[1:32:45] but yet
[1:32:46] her desire was for
[1:32:49] a son
[1:32:51] and remember god had closed her womb for
[1:32:53] a certain time
[1:32:55] an appointed season
[1:32:56] god had an appointed seed to come
[1:33:01] but the attentiveness of this is close
[1:33:04] that attentiveness that was there
[1:33:07] let me tell you something i never forget
[1:33:10] i forget when brother brother monica
[1:33:12] kobias when he was ministering at the
[1:33:13] other we were renting renting that
[1:33:15] church
[1:33:16] and he was dealing with
[1:33:18] hezekiah and when hezekiah turned his
[1:33:20] wall his head to the wall
[1:33:22] and he began to repent
[1:33:25] it's oh god i need to set my house in
[1:33:26] order give me lord 15 more years that i
[1:33:28] can set it in order he realized the
[1:33:30] house was not in a position for him to
[1:33:32] pass
[1:33:34] so god gave him grace to set his house
[1:33:36] in order and never forget what brother
[1:33:38] monaco
[1:33:39] he stepped around he's standing up there
[1:33:40] by the altar how that was at the other
[1:33:42] church and he says god before any any
[1:33:44] tear could ever come out of here god
[1:33:46] already seen
[1:33:48] that welling up in the tear ducts
[1:33:50] back in his eye
[1:33:51] you know what you know what that speaks
[1:33:53] to me of god's attentiveness
[1:33:56] before we even would crowd before
[1:33:58] there's a moment of sorrow god already
[1:34:01] sees
[1:34:02] and he knows
[1:34:05] samuel then what should i do well
[1:34:08] i would just
[1:34:09] this is what i would do i would just
[1:34:12] look to him
[1:34:13] lord you know my need
[1:34:16] you know what i have need of now let me
[1:34:18] just share this with you brother braham
[1:34:19] said
[1:34:20] you find this over and over
[1:34:22] i said i was closing let's just let's
[1:34:24] stand
[1:34:27] i'll talk to you a few more moments
[1:34:30] but this is what i want you i want you
[1:34:31] to catch this here sometimes you look at
[1:34:33] situations and you and we can look at
[1:34:35] them and we say i don't know i don't see
[1:34:38] this or i don't see look god has not
[1:34:40] been speaking these things to overwhelm
[1:34:42] our lives or for us to walk out here and
[1:34:44] say oh i can't do this no this is god
[1:34:47] speaking to what lays within us
[1:34:49] what he has deposited of his own life
[1:34:51] and if he hasn't he's here to deposit it
[1:34:53] tonight
[1:34:55] and to receive that that this might be
[1:34:57] reflected he's not asked you and i or
[1:35:00] called us to do something
[1:35:01] that is impossible with us yes but not
[1:35:04] with him
[1:35:05] so we can give ourselves to him like
[1:35:07] brother brahm says over and over in the
[1:35:08] message desperation then uh just reading
[1:35:11] in another place in the message here
[1:35:14] brother brown says if you come here
[1:35:16] and you come up front
[1:35:17] and you say i don't know
[1:35:19] i tell you i tell you i just feel so
[1:35:21] terrible i feel so bad i don't know i've
[1:35:23] been prayed for so many times i just
[1:35:25] don't i don't know brother branstad you
[1:35:27] might as well go on home
[1:35:29] might as well go home
[1:35:32] in desperation well i don't know god
[1:35:34] wants to give me the holy ghost he'll
[1:35:35] give it to me he said just stay in your
[1:35:37] seat don't even come up
[1:35:39] why because everything is based on faith
[1:35:44] to believe him
[1:35:48] to believe what he has said in his word
[1:35:51] he will perform it he didn't ask you and
[1:35:53] how to figure out how how can this be
[1:35:55] how can that be but if remember a gift
[1:35:57] is to get ourselves out of the way
[1:35:59] if we can just say lord
[1:36:01] let me get myself out of the way
[1:36:03] that you can just come and
[1:36:05] fill up that empty part
[1:36:08] you know we might have to dig out a
[1:36:09] little bit dig this valley full of
[1:36:10] ditches we might have to dig dig dig dig
[1:36:12] dig but if we dig
[1:36:14] the rock
[1:36:16] is still in the land tonight
[1:36:18] the rock that can release that water
[1:36:19] right down through that channel he's
[1:36:20] still here what i have to do just dig
[1:36:22] out just dig out
[1:36:23] it ain't up to you to supply the water
[1:36:25] just dig out
[1:36:27] the water will come
