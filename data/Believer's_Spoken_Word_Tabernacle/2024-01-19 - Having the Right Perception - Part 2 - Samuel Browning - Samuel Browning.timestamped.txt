[38:21] Christ
[38:24] amen amen God bless you thank you
[38:27] musicians and brother
[38:30] Brian um let's go here in the scripture
[38:34] to job
[38:39] 23 want to say it just as
[38:43] uh what a weekend the lord gave
[38:46] us and uh just such a a wonderful time
[38:51] in the presence of the
[38:53] Lord um just so enjoyed Saturday even
[38:56] evening enjoyed that time and uh just
[38:59] was a real time of refreshing with the
[39:03] with the worship singing and the
[39:05] testimonies and U so enjoyed the
[39:09] ministering of the word uh I just uh
[39:13] with the thoughts and that God shared I
[39:16] I love I just love how the Lord just
[39:19] just brought everything so personal uh I
[39:23] I thought you know I I told brother
[39:25] Trevor on the phone just yesterday I
[39:27] said you know I said God brought it from
[39:30] the heavenlies and put it in a
[39:32] lunchbox I said that's what I love
[39:35] that's what I love God makes his word so
[39:38] simple and uh many many wonderful things
[39:41] I that God spoke to us and I just I know
[39:44] that I know that in our hearts one of
[39:46] the things that we would long to do and
[39:49] I think sometimes we the enemy likes to
[39:52] get us so busy sometimes with things but
[39:54] may we may we not let our mind Drift
[39:56] from the things that God has spoke to us
[39:58] on because anytime in any service when
[40:01] God comes like that to me it speaks so
[40:04] personal what that is when God brings
[40:06] his word it's God calling us over
[40:08] remember when brother bam said that uh
[40:11] he the the the the that crowbar was
[40:14] given and it ripped off the top of the
[40:16] mountain and he's told them he says look
[40:19] upon these things and then he went on
[40:22] off to the West I mean there was a time
[40:25] we understand that all symbolic the
[40:27] prophet passing on but what was given in
[40:30] this hour look upon that word and that
[40:34] which was uncovered and I look at that
[40:36] that every time that God speaks to our
[40:38] hearts that's God calling you and I to
[40:41] look on these things and there's things
[40:43] that sometimes we don't all together you
[40:45] know how it is we don't all together get
[40:47] it sometimes in one setting but there's
[40:50] things that little nuggets that we need
[40:52] to get in that setting that it'll stand
[40:54] out to us and uh for myself I I I sat
[40:58] there many times you know and I
[41:00] sometimes I'm just sitting and I'm
[41:01] taking I'm taking the notes sometimes
[41:04] the thought is so good I just write down
[41:06] uh uh one hour and 45 minute Mark so I
[41:10] can go back on YouTube and come back to
[41:12] this spot it's just I can't write all
[41:14] that that part down that thought but
[41:16] there's just so many good thoughts that
[41:19] God's expressed and he spoke to our
[41:21] hearts on that of alone and loneliness
[41:24] and so uh we just want to look here in
[41:27] the word of the Lord just for a few
[41:29] moments tonight back in job 23 and verse
[41:33] 13 and it says but he is in one mind and
[41:37] who can turn him and what his soul
[41:40] desireth even that he doeth for he
[41:44] performeth the thing that is appointed
[41:46] for me and many such things are with him
[41:50] therefore am I troubled at his presence
[41:53] when I consider I am Afra afraid of him
[41:57] for God maketh my heart soft and the
[42:01] almighty troubleth me because I was not
[42:05] cut off before the darkness neither hath
[42:09] he covered the darkness from my face and
[42:13] I just like to continue on that thought
[42:15] tonight on having the right perception
[42:18] so may God bless you and bless the
[42:19] reading of the word as you're being
[42:22] seated
[42:24] uh just feeling in my heart to stay with
[42:27] this this part of it tonight it was just
[42:29] really kind of torn between two parts
[42:31] even up to the moments back there and
[42:34] just looking at this thought on on
[42:37] perception and we often times know the
[42:40] word of of perceiving and sometimes that
[42:43] in itself is uh it's left open really to
[42:47] interpretation sometimes the way we can
[42:49] even uh look at events and uh and go
[42:54] about things is sometimes even from
[42:56] previous things that we've uh
[42:58] experienced In Our Lifetime and uh when
[43:01] we find that that I'm sure there's not
[43:04] one of us in here that hasn't at one
[43:06] time or another had the wrong perception
[43:09] about something and we whether it would
[43:13] have been something about you know of
[43:15] what God's thinking us concerning us or
[43:18] something about us or something we've
[43:20] looked at in the word maybe it was just
[43:22] a wrong perception of how that you were
[43:25] perceiving things that were going on at
[43:28] the job I know sometimes brother
[43:30] brandham talked about it and and I can
[43:32] relate to it as well sometimes you can
[43:34] look out on a congregation and if you
[43:37] simply sometimes just look sometimes at
[43:39] what you see it might look like that
[43:42] people are in complete disagreement with
[43:45] it but yet and sometimes you'll turn
[43:48] right back around and it'll be the very
[43:50] person or persons that will come up to
[43:52] you later not not just here sometimes at
[43:54] a meeting and it'll come up to you and
[43:56] say this is exactly what I needed to
[43:59] hear from God now in reality who was it
[44:03] that was the problem I know that seems
[44:05] odd that something like that could even
[44:07] be right here while I would be standing
[44:10] and ministering but brother Bram even
[44:12] tells us that even while he's standing
[44:14] and preaching he the sickness in his
[44:16] body he says I'm having to take the
[44:18] opposite thought of this right now to
[44:21] keep from pitching over this Podium so
[44:25] sometimes it's things that we look at
[44:27] you know and I thank God and I we come
[44:30] through those experiences in our life
[44:33] that where God would help us and you
[44:35] know does it mean that we'll never be
[44:37] tested in that again does it mean that
[44:39] we'll never have a thought that might
[44:41] not come in that would be wrong no it
[44:43] doesn't mean that at all but where it
[44:45] comes down to is that Lord help me that
[44:48] in everything that does come in let me
[44:51] try it by you because sometimes there's
[44:54] things that we can try the world we can
[44:55] can try the thought and we might have an
[44:58] absolute scripture that would absolutely
[45:01] speak or be expressive against that but
[45:03] then there's other times where the
[45:05] thoughts that come in we have to try it
[45:08] based on the very character and nature
[45:11] of almighty God so I ask that God would
[45:13] just help us and give us the grace that
[45:15] we need because we all have been in
[45:18] those times and places of the wrong
[45:20] perception and interpret things the
[45:23] wrong way and I'm thankful to God for
[45:25] his Grace that would bring us around
[45:27] just like I I read to you uh some quotes
[45:30] or a quote last week and to me it's
[45:32] always been an interesting study not a
[45:34] lot of quotes but there is a number of
[45:36] them is over the time of I used to think
[45:39] brother BR talks about how he says I
[45:40] used to think dancing in the spirit was
[45:43] wrong he said I used to think tongues
[45:46] was wrong and then I quoted one to you
[45:48] which brother Ram quotes over and over
[45:50] all the way through the seals he said I
[45:52] used to think God was angry with me but
[45:55] Christ loved me then he said I've come
[45:57] to find out another place I've come to
[46:00] realize that Christ is the very Heart Of
[46:03] God so to understand what God thought
[46:06] about me or thinks about you and the
[46:08] prophet would even quote that in the
[46:09] seals is to understand that God himself
[46:13] loved you and I so much that he was
[46:16] willing to condens send and become one
[46:19] of us to pay the price and to that he
[46:22] might impart his life back to you and I
[46:26] now this a perception it's a way of
[46:28] understanding something sometimes it's a
[46:30] mental impression of something or in way
[46:34] of interpreting something a quote that I
[46:36] read to you last week out of three kinds
[46:38] of Believers and I I think this is so
[46:40] fitting of how the prophet places it
[46:42] here and he says regarding job and job's
[46:45] thoughts as long as Satan can make him
[46:48] believe that his sickness was his God
[46:51] doing it he had job whipped it wasn't
[46:56] God doing it it was Satan doing it and
[46:59] the same thing today he'll try to tell
[47:02] you these trials and things as your God
[47:05] trying to put punishment upon you it
[47:08] isn't no sir it's Satan doing it and God
[47:13] permitting it to temper you probably no
[47:16] doubt different ones Brother Ray and
[47:18] others that worked in the steel mill we
[47:20] realize that what it means for something
[47:22] to be tempered it means to where it
[47:24] actually grows to a great place of of
[47:27] hardening or able to Bear because we we
[47:30] never want to be able the Bible doesn't
[47:32] say become hard but it says endure
[47:36] hardness as a good soldier so not to
[47:39] become hard and that in itself it really
[47:41] takes the work of the holy spirit that
[47:43] we would not become hardened and and
[47:46] bitter and with all of the cares and
[47:49] things that maybe that we could go
[47:51] through in life and I'll tell you one of
[47:52] the secrets for that is our relationship
[47:55] with almighty God we we need a continual
[47:59] refilling of the Holy Ghost and I want
[48:02] you to think about this that the Holy
[48:04] Spirit himself is God's Own love now let
[48:08] me just finish reading this quote and
[48:10] I'll move on he says what it is it's to
[48:13] make you see if you are tied to this
[48:16] Earth by the Earth cares or whether your
[48:20] Treasures is in heaven now I want you to
[48:22] think about this if God knows that I
[48:25] would somehow be tied to the Earth or
[48:28] there would be a strong pull if God knew
[48:31] that then why is it that God would want
[48:34] me to see that because I am a son you're
[48:37] a son or daughter of God and as a son
[48:39] and daughter of God God does not push us
[48:42] through a pipe or pull us through a pipe
[48:44] and say blessed is he that overcometh
[48:47] but the prophet tells us of all the
[48:49] promises that are laying before us he
[48:51] said but you have a decision yourself to
[48:54] make and the way that we show our faith
[48:58] in God is by the decisions we make
[49:02] regarding the promises based on who said
[49:06] it so to make you see whether you're
[49:09] tied to this Earth by the Earth cares or
[49:12] whether your treasure is in heaven for
[49:14] wherever your treasure is there you are
[49:16] also your heart is where your Treasures
[49:21] are now I want you to think about this
[49:23] in Romans chapter 5 the the Bible says
[49:26] therefore being justified by faith we
[49:29] have peace with God through our Lord
[49:31] Jesus Christ by whom also we have access
[49:35] by faith into this grace wherein we
[49:38] stand and rejoice in the hope of the
[49:41] glory of God and not only so but we
[49:45] glory in
[49:47] tribulations also knowing that
[49:51] tribulation worketh patience so there's
[49:54] absolutely no other way for our patience
[49:57] to grow outside of tribulation now think
[50:01] about that even when you look at the
[50:03] stature of a perfect man brother B will
[50:06] talk about it and I don't know how far
[50:08] he put his fingers apart when he's
[50:09] preaching is your life worthy of the
[50:11] Gospel but he says your patience starts
[50:13] out about this long and he said then
[50:15] eventually it gets to be this long I
[50:17] don't know how how far apart he put his
[50:19] fingers but I get the gist of it is that
[50:21] our patience will actually grow but you
[50:24] see patience itself like all the other
[50:27] virtues never grow unless there is a
[50:31] contrast to it or opposition so all of
[50:34] those things with those virtues they
[50:36] actually grow in our life and that of
[50:39] adding to it deals with an actual
[50:41] increase so and not only so but we glory
[50:45] in tribulations also now I don't know
[50:48] about you but I still look at that and
[50:50] say God help me to recognize it and to
[50:52] be able to glory in tribulations now now
[50:55] I'm not worshiping the sickness I'm not
[50:57] worshiping the trial but what it is in
[51:00] the midst of it is to know coming to a
[51:03] place to understand that when
[51:05] tribulation comes around that
[51:07] tribulation is in no sign of God's
[51:10] disapproval toward me his our only sign
[51:14] of approval is our Acceptance in the
[51:17] Beloved and if there's anything that's
[51:19] out of line God will let you and I know
[51:22] about it in other words our worship it's
[51:25] our rejoicing the way that we would
[51:28] conduct our life as Believers does not
[51:31] cease when tribulations come our way if
[51:34] there was something to where that as a
[51:36] life could run right back out into the
[51:38] world oh this was a hard time or this
[51:40] situation came or and you know sometimes
[51:42] there are great great situations that
[51:45] can come when you think about it I think
[51:47] back when I was a Believer or a
[51:49] Christian starting out in my journey
[51:51] there were things that came around in
[51:53] that very part of it that tested and
[51:56] things would come that was very
[51:58] disappointing things that didn't go
[52:00] exactly the way that maybe I wanted it
[52:02] to go or was thinking it was going to go
[52:05] or praying about it but when it all
[52:07] comes down to the end of the way God
[52:10] himself already knew that but God
[52:13] allowed that moment of testing and
[52:15] trying not to show to himself but for
[52:19] God to bring out in our lives that trust
[52:22] in him and that you and I might see
[52:25] there's something deeper than my
[52:27] abilities that's holding on this is
[52:30] something greater than me going to
[52:32] school and saying well I'm not going to
[52:33] get caught into bad jokes I'm not going
[52:35] to get caught up in the swearing with
[52:37] the boys again I'm not going to get in
[52:39] I've been there done that but it had to
[52:41] come something to where there was
[52:43] something down in my heart what was it
[52:45] it was a desire that though I didn't
[52:48] understand what was going on my love for
[52:50] God was greater than all of my
[52:53] understanding it was greater Than My
[52:56] reasonings it was greater than all of my
[52:58] wants I could cry because my wants were
[53:02] not being fulfilled I could weep but yet
[53:04] down on the midst of it there was an
[53:07] anchor something that was holding and
[53:10] that was the love of
[53:12] God now what I just gave you in a may
[53:15] maybe a measure of paragraph I could not
[53:18] have explained that at that time when I
[53:21] was disappointed and things didn't go I
[53:23] couldn't have explained it that way but
[53:24] it just goes to show you it isn't about
[53:27] how much you can explain God lets you
[53:29] know what he's done after he's done it
[53:32] and you can look back at it down in your
[53:34] life and say there was something greater
[53:37] there than my
[53:40] abilities oh my and not only so we glory
[53:45] in Tribulation knowing that tribulation
[53:47] worketh patience and patience
[53:51] experience and experience hope so you
[53:54] know when you have been patient
[53:57] throughout the and what what allows us
[53:59] to be patient
[54:01] faith faith yeah and faith is not about
[54:05] knowing how things will happen or when
[54:08] that that's not faith faith just says
[54:10] God said
[54:12] so God said so I just was reading today
[54:15] where the Prophet said when you can take
[54:17] God at his word in a place of God said
[54:20] so then he said it opens up a stream
[54:23] between you and
[54:25] God it's just that simple God said so
[54:30] it's not about me God said so and if
[54:33] God's made a promise I am don't have the
[54:36] ability to bring myself in the condition
[54:39] for that promise to be fulfilled but the
[54:42] same God who spoke it is the same God
[54:45] that brings the conditions how does he
[54:47] do that by our hearts being surrendered
[54:50] how is my heart surrendered because as
[54:53] God speaks to us we realize this is
[54:56] God's mind this is God's thought this is
[55:00] God's interest concerning my
[55:04] life and it brings
[55:08] faith my
[55:10] my an experience brings hope and hope
[55:13] meaning an expectation that I don't know
[55:16] how through so through ex examples and
[55:18] situation just like the older veterans
[55:20] that are here tonight there is when they
[55:23] would come and you could talk with them
[55:25] that have been serving the lord for a
[55:28] great number of time they've been
[55:29] through a lot of Trials they've been
[55:31] through a lot of heartaches they've been
[55:32] through a lot of disappointments they've
[55:34] had a lot of times where God said no
[55:36] they've had a lot of times where
[55:38] situations did not turn out the way they
[55:41] thought they would turn out but in the
[55:42] midst of it all there was something
[55:45] deeper within their life that held them
[55:48] and that was the love of God to where
[55:52] that they themselves can stand and
[55:54] expect God to fulfill his
[55:57] word how can you do that when you have
[55:59] prayed and maybe this situation in your
[56:02] home did not go according to how you
[56:04] prayed well just because I was looking
[56:06] for it to happen this way or this
[56:08] timeline or this time frame has that
[56:11] doesn't mean anything to do with God's
[56:12] word if there's anything that's wrong it
[56:15] was my perception regarding it
[56:19] Hallelujah now let me just stop here
[56:21] think about when John when here he sees
[56:24] the Lamb of God he said Behold the Lamb
[56:26] of God it was identified by the pillar
[56:28] of fire and John himself after that's
[56:32] left he as he said to his disciples go
[56:35] ask if he's the one when he's down in
[56:36] prison or do we look for
[56:39] another now how could a man that would
[56:42] stand there in the midst of that time
[56:44] say such a thing like that this is why
[56:47] when brother Brandon preaches the
[56:48] Forgotten beatitude he takes that
[56:51] scripture and it's a beatitude that's
[56:53] actually stuck in the middle of of other
[56:55] scriptures blessed is he that is not
[56:58] offended in me and notice John himself
[57:02] did not have the right
[57:06] perception but yet what he spoke was
[57:08] right on the
[57:10] money is that right it was right on the
[57:13] money but the word came to John and let
[57:16] John know that go tell John what you see
[57:20] taking place and when John could hear
[57:24] what was taking place what did it do it
[57:27] opened up or it changed his
[57:32] perception hallelujah how I feel is God
[57:36] let my perception always be open to
[57:41] you cuz sometimes you know I understand
[57:44] where the Prophet as he tells us and I
[57:46] always love this quote out of what shall
[57:48] I do with Jesus called Christ and
[57:50] brother BR says if you can get a vision
[57:53] of a perfectly he person standing in
[57:56] front of you he said then you walk step
[57:58] by step by step until you become that
[58:02] person and that is very that that is
[58:05] right on but how how the whole part the
[58:08] whole path of the journey how all of
[58:10] that comes out I don't know that Faith
[58:12] doesn't have to
[58:14] know Faith does not need to know all the
[58:17] steps along the way faith is simply God
[58:21] said so that's
[58:23] it right that's now job listen job has
[58:29] not heard or received a change of
[58:32] thought from God I read we read those uh
[58:35] groups of scriptures last week where job
[58:38] himself the things that he his
[58:41] perception of of things that are taking
[58:43] place in his life but his perception was
[58:47] wrong right job had an
[58:50] anchor he had an anchor and where he
[58:53] stood he stood on what God had
[58:57] revealed let me tell you something you
[59:00] stand you're tested you and I are tested

[59:10] this word that word is to become flesh
[59:12] in our life and the only way it can

[1:03:40] on oh that's God's Sovereign Grace and
[1:03:44] it has to take over it's got to it's
[1:03:46] God's nature God can't do nothing else
[1:03:48] but do that
[1:03:50] amen I want to go to Ruth chapter 1: 19
[1:03:58] here is
[1:04:00] Naomi and Ruth coming back home or has
[1:04:04] already
[1:04:06] departed in verse
[1:04:08] 19 so they two went until they came to
[1:04:12] Bethlehem and it came to pass when they
[1:04:14] were Come to Bethlehem that all the city
[1:04:16] was moved about them and they said is
[1:04:19] this Naomi and she said unto them call
[1:04:22] me not Naomi call me Mara for the
[1:04:26] almighty hath dealt very bitterly with
[1:04:29] me I went out full and the Lord hath
[1:04:32] brought me home again empty why then
[1:04:35] call ye me Naomi seeing the Lord hath
[1:04:39] testified against me and the almighty
[1:04:42] hath Afflicted me so Naomi returned and
[1:04:46] Ruth the moabitas her daughter-in-law
[1:04:48] with her which returned out of the
[1:04:50] country of Moab and they came to
[1:04:53] Bethlehem in the beginning of barley
[1:04:56] Harvest now there's many wonderful types
[1:04:59] in there and I I I love preaching types
[1:05:02] but I I just want to just speak of one
[1:05:05] point and one thought here brother B
[1:05:08] takes an in there about Naomi in the
[1:05:11] message the kinsman redeemer and I want
[1:05:12] you to think about this Naomi her
[1:05:15] husband and their boys had
[1:05:18] left the land that God gave them they
[1:05:22] had an inheritance in this land and
[1:05:26] remember brother brand would say this
[1:05:28] over and over we see it in the scripture
[1:05:30] every time a Jew got out of Palestine
[1:05:33] they got in trouble because that's the
[1:05:36] god-given
[1:05:38] land and any time you or I get out of
[1:05:42] what God has given us is going to be
[1:05:46] trouble now we understand friends that
[1:05:49] not every time is when tests or trials
[1:05:53] or things come our way we understand
[1:05:56] that that is not always when things uh
[1:05:59] adversity comes is it correction but
[1:06:02] neither do we want to just walk with an
[1:06:05] assumption or have a perception an
[1:06:08] imagination in our heart that well
[1:06:10] everything is okay we can look clearly
[1:06:13] in God's word and say lord it's not just
[1:06:16] about what I feel but is everything that
[1:06:19] is laid out before me am I living
[1:06:22] according to all that you have said Do
[1:06:25] Is My Life walking in obedience with you
[1:06:29] now they got outside of the land and we
[1:06:32] understand what took place here amalec
[1:06:34] her husband passes on you know her sons
[1:06:37] that married those two moabite women Ora
[1:06:41] and Ruth they passed away too and then
[1:06:44] you find that when they both are coming
[1:06:47] with Naomi and they're going to go back
[1:06:49] into the land you know there was a an
[1:06:51] affinity and a tithe that they had there
[1:06:53] you know a resp responsibility that
[1:06:54] wasn't wrong to have that kind of a
[1:06:57] responsibility to want to care for their
[1:07:00] mother-in-law but it was something to
[1:07:02] where that only took was one word from
[1:07:04] Naomi to say go back to your land
[1:07:08] because what if I could even bear any
[1:07:11] more Sons would you still be old enough
[1:07:13] to receive him it took just one little
[1:07:15] word of discouragement for orpa to
[1:07:20] say yeah that's good by
[1:07:25] but for
[1:07:26] Ruth think about it I want you to think
[1:07:29] she's a
[1:07:30] moit hallu there's a curse over
[1:07:35] them she does not know what beholds or
[1:07:39] what awaits
[1:07:40] her she does not have any promise
[1:07:44] seemingly in the land that's true amen
[1:07:48] amazing but she is moved Hallelujah
[1:07:51] brother Brandon would say like this she
[1:07:53] had a vision
[1:07:55] oh yeah it was a decision she made right
[1:07:59] here in chapter one The Prophet says
[1:08:02] that actually later on got boaz's
[1:08:07] attention her simple simple statement of
[1:08:11] your God will be my
[1:08:13] God your people will be my people where
[1:08:17] you stay I'll stay where you go I'm
[1:08:21] going to go that simple statement of
[1:08:24] obedience of simply saying Lord I am
[1:08:28] just going to take you at your word amen
[1:08:33] amen Naomi comes back in and her
[1:08:37] announcement she's told the people
[1:08:38] they're all well they're all glad to see
[1:08:40] her oh it's so good to see you Naomi and
[1:08:43] Naomi comes back
[1:08:45] in but she says call me
[1:08:48] Mara there's been through bitter
[1:08:51] experiences we understand this with the
[1:08:53] Jews and coming back into their land and
[1:08:56] even in the time we're standing of
[1:08:57] barley Harvest but to think how the
[1:08:59] prophet would speak of it like this
[1:09:02] Naomi wondered in the kinsman redeemer
[1:09:04] she wondered how many of you and I have
[1:09:07] wondered yeah why has the hand of the
[1:09:11] Lord been so cruel to me my
[1:09:13] daughter-in-laws God has cast me out I'm
[1:09:16] an outcast I don't know what I ever done
[1:09:20] but I'm an
[1:09:21] outcast now to think about this I don't
[1:09:24] know what I ever done but yet we realize
[1:09:27] we understand that there was a part in
[1:09:29] it that Naomi and their family left to
[1:09:33] go into another land right you know you
[1:09:36] would look at and you would consider why
[1:09:38] isn't Naomi the only one that comes back
[1:09:40] or the one that's returning well in
[1:09:42] order there had to be somebody that
[1:09:45] would be able to bring Ruth in right it
[1:09:48] had to be that of a gentile Gentile had
[1:09:51] to be that of coming through a Jew and
[1:09:53] then a gentile would come in but you
[1:09:55] know re Ruth it would not have been
[1:09:57] enough for Ruth and Ruth's husband to
[1:10:00] have come back in the land because she
[1:10:02] would have still have been seemingly
[1:10:04] like an outcast but God himself would
[1:10:07] bring it and Lead it to a place to where
[1:10:10] here Naomi is coming back in with her
[1:10:13] daughter-in-law she does not know all
[1:10:16] that is going to transpire she cannot
[1:10:18] just walk in there and say I'm taking my
[1:10:21] inheritance back but God has made made
[1:10:24] provision so in all of her wonderings no
[1:10:27] doubt it seemed strange the prophet said
[1:10:31] sometimes it seems strange the way that
[1:10:33] God will lead us to do certain things he
[1:10:37] said but we find out when it is in the
[1:10:39] predestinated plan of God there is
[1:10:42] nothing can stop God's plan from coming
[1:10:46] to
[1:10:48] pass look at this God was working his
[1:10:52] program but he didn't have have to
[1:10:53] explain it to Naomi right we understand
[1:10:57] what took place between Ruth and Boaz
[1:10:59] and even how that Ruth herself would
[1:11:01] come and you know here here She is she
[1:11:04] comes into a field Ruth herself does not
[1:11:07] even know whose field this is or even if
[1:11:10] she did she still doesn't know the
[1:11:12] significance of
[1:11:14] him and when she comes into the field
[1:11:17] Boaz begins to notice her day after day
[1:11:20] and bohas tells those of the Reapers he
[1:11:23] says I want you to leave handfuls of
[1:11:27] meal that she might pick it up it was
[1:11:30] little handfuls that she gathered it was
[1:11:34] Promises of God that she was gathering
[1:11:38] she still does not have any promise she
[1:11:41] doesn't know what's going to come next
[1:11:43] but she is obedient to what is before
[1:11:48] her that's what God calls you and I to
[1:11:50] do it's sometimes the greatest thing the
[1:11:53] Great greatest compliment that we can
[1:11:55] give God remember brother B says the
[1:11:57] greatest compliment is to believe God
[1:12:01] because what God has said is true that's
[1:12:04] the greatest compliment so how do we
[1:12:06] believe God we believe him and it shows
[1:12:09] in
[1:12:11] obedience and here she's taking up these
[1:12:13] handful after handful and then we
[1:12:15] understand as What It All Leads to to
[1:12:18] where that here Ruth herself ends up
[1:12:22] coming into the C
[1:12:24] through that Union with Boaz and brother
[1:12:27] brand was saiding like this God was
[1:12:28] working his program because all things
[1:12:31] work together for good to them that love
[1:12:33] God no matter what it
[1:12:37] is I'm sure there's a lot of things
[1:12:39] that's may be taking place whether it's
[1:12:41] family whether it's other things we
[1:12:43] would not have chosen things to occur
[1:12:45] the way they did or thought about them
[1:12:47] in that way but God knows exactly what
[1:12:50] to do to get you and I or even others
[1:12:54] into a place where he can speak to
[1:12:59] them I'm glad he don't ask me because I
[1:13:02] would tell him no I don't want that
[1:13:04] done but yet you know what something
[1:13:06] about I believe with my heart that there
[1:13:08] is something greater inside of me and
[1:13:11] inside of you like it was for Hatty
[1:13:13] Wright Hatty Wright could have asked for
[1:13:15] material things she could ask for a
[1:13:17] million dollars she could ask for her
[1:13:20] her little sister
[1:13:22] Edith who dealt with that that condition
[1:13:25] the whole time and brother Bram would
[1:13:27] say over and over I don't understand why
[1:13:29] God hadn't healed her brother BR say
[1:13:32] that in tapes but yet she could ask for
[1:13:35] that and the prophet standing there and
[1:13:36] letting her know what you can ask for
[1:13:38] your mom your dad all these other things
[1:13:40] but what she asked for was something of
[1:13:43] an eternal
[1:13:45] value brother Samuel what do you say I'm
[1:13:48] saying like this that there may be the
[1:13:50] way that when we're looking about
[1:13:52] praying for our loved ones instead of
[1:13:54] praying for God to bless them ask God
[1:13:58] lord deal with their hearts to where
[1:14:00] they come to a place that they recognize
[1:14:03] they need you I don't care maybe how
[1:14:05] downtrod they are or how successful they
[1:14:08] are bring them to a place Lord that they
[1:14:11] realize without you they're
[1:14:16] naked yes sir because why that's the
[1:14:19] more eternal
[1:14:22] part
[1:14:24] amen oh God help us let me try to let me
[1:14:28] try to move on here Mark chapter 16
[1:14:31] verse
[1:14:33] 17 I want to read this scripture here A
[1:14:36] Familiar scripture to us as Believers
[1:14:38] and we believe Mark 16's inspired we
[1:14:41] believe these
[1:14:42] scriptures we believe this we're
[1:14:45] Witnesses of this right here and these
[1:14:48] signs shall follow them that believe in
[1:14:50] my name shall they cast out devils they
[1:14:53] shall speak with new tongues they shall
[1:14:56] take up serpents and if they drink any
[1:14:58] deadly thing it shall not hurt them they
[1:15:02] shall lay hands on the sick and they
[1:15:04] shall recover oh yes oh yes those are
[1:15:09] the general orders and they've never
[1:15:12] [Music]
[1:15:14] changed
[1:15:15] hallelujah what that says right there is
[1:15:18] there's anything that gets between a
[1:15:21] Believer and the promise God has
[1:15:24] equipped you and I with victory in our
[1:15:27] lives to overcome
[1:15:30] it
[1:15:32] amen I want to deal with that last
[1:15:34] little part just a few moments here and
[1:15:37] they shall
[1:15:39] recover brother brandham you know when
[1:15:41] you go through and listening to the
[1:15:42] messages a trial the trial a court trial
[1:15:46] you know brother Bram will take those
[1:15:47] messages and uh dealing
[1:15:50] with uh these fellas in there by the
[1:15:53] name of Mr unbeliever Mr skeptic and Mr
[1:15:59] impatient brother br will take it down
[1:16:01] through Abraham's life Noah's life and
[1:16:03] all
[1:16:04] this you'll find brother brandham in the
[1:16:07] midst of that message sitting out now he
[1:16:08] said I'm just he said this isn't me this
[1:16:11] is I'm just saying what the prosecutor
[1:16:13] would say in other words I ain't even
[1:16:15] started yet as the defense
[1:16:18] witness oh I just love those little
[1:16:21] things like that pH glory be to God but
[1:16:25] you know brother B says how that Noah
[1:16:27] you know Noah was given a promise 120
[1:16:30] years how that it was it was you know
[1:16:33] rain was
[1:16:34] coming and rain and you know God and
[1:16:37] Noah was given that promise and brother
[1:16:39] Brandon would tell us you know like this
[1:16:41] of how that the defense went us you know
[1:16:43] standing because Noah faced every one of
[1:16:46] these things before him brother BR calls
[1:16:49] it like this he says Noah he wants to
[1:16:52] wants to also let this court know that
[1:16:55] Mr unbeliever Mr skeptic and Mr
[1:16:59] impatient tempted him all
[1:17:03] along are you hearing me they did not
[1:17:06] look at Noah and say he's a prophet of
[1:17:08] God with a word they tempted him all
[1:17:15] along everything let me let me tell you
[1:17:17] something these the way all of this
[1:17:20] right here these are supernatural beings
[1:17:24] when the prophet's calling him Mr
[1:17:25] unbeliever Mr skeptic and Mr impatient
[1:17:29] he goes on and says these are
[1:17:31] Supernatural
[1:17:33] characters they're
[1:17:35] demons don't ever just think that a
[1:17:38] thought is a thought a thought is a
[1:17:41] spirit it comes from somewhere and
[1:17:45] project it in your
[1:17:48] mind this is why brother Brandon when he
[1:17:50] would preach that message three kinds of
[1:17:52] believers and lay it all the way out
[1:17:55] well you know it would be very easy I'm
[1:17:56] sure everybody would say well man I'm a
[1:17:59] Believer and I trust that we can always
[1:18:01] identify with that but I love how the
[1:18:03] prophet comes at the end of that message
[1:18:05] it's a about the last uh 18 minutes of
[1:18:08] that message and brother Brandon begins
[1:18:10] to go into prayer and he tells the
[1:18:12] people he says look out of what's been
[1:18:14] preached today if you find yourself in
[1:18:17] one of these other categories he said
[1:18:20] I'm standing here to offer a prayer of
[1:18:24] intercessory I'm here to pray and that
[1:18:27] there's something that you find in your
[1:18:29] heart or your life that won't line up
[1:18:31] with God's word but you say Lord I see
[1:18:33] it in your word I don't understand it
[1:18:36] but I want to believe it he said why
[1:18:38] don't you raise your hand and will offer
[1:18:40] prayer right
[1:18:44] now what are you saying brother Samuel
[1:18:47] that the devil is not the amen God is
[1:18:50] the amen and your condition right now
[1:18:54] even a category or even something that
[1:18:56] can be in your mind or in your body is
[1:18:59] not the finality but God In His
[1:19:02] Marvelous Grace can give such strength
[1:19:06] can breathe such inspiration such Faith
[1:19:09] to move from one category to another to
[1:19:12] move a life from sickness to health
[1:19:16] sinner to
[1:19:17] Saint and let me just say this to you
[1:19:20] this wasn't brother brandham going out
[1:19:22] on a limb he's standing on the word of
[1:19:24] God you say what word is that back in
[1:19:26] John chapter 17 father I would that they
[1:19:29] would be with me where I am
[1:19:32] also and that prayer of intercession by
[1:19:35] the Lord Jesus was reflective of where
[1:19:38] you and I were before the before the
[1:19:40] world begin in the mind of
[1:19:43] God so we're not out on a limb we're
[1:19:45] right in the word even where Paul could
[1:19:48] say I pray that your understanding being
[1:19:51] open Hallelujah
[1:19:53] yeah Hallelujah tempted him all
[1:19:58] along but being a prophet knowing that
[1:20:00] God could not lie he held on to the word
[1:20:04] regardless praise the Lord Brother BR
[1:20:07] tells us of how that Noah conflict
[1:20:10] between God and Satan Noah got in the
[1:20:14] ark door was shut remember God called
[1:20:17] them from inside the ark come in God
[1:20:20] closed the door and then when they got
[1:20:22] inside the door and it was closed all
[1:20:24] shut up Noah said tomorrow morning wait
[1:20:26] boys it's going to rain now I'm quoting
[1:20:29] what the prophet said in conflict
[1:20:30] between God and
[1:20:31] Satan and no rain
[1:20:34] came second morning Noah had said it's
[1:20:37] going to rain tomorrow boys no rain
[1:20:41] third day no rain the fourth day they
[1:20:44] almost got their smartphone out and
[1:20:45] looked on
[1:20:48] YouTube calling they were about to look
[1:20:50] up doubt the sign you know
[1:20:53] then here came the fifth day H boys it's
[1:20:55] going to be
[1:20:57] tomorrow and then oh the next day it's
[1:20:59] going to be tomorrow brother Samuel
[1:21:01] don't that bother you at all not at all
[1:21:03] because it shows a Believer when God has
[1:21:06] said something I'm not looking for it
[1:21:08] way out in the future it's right
[1:21:10] here faith is
[1:21:15] now if it ain't here tomorrow then I'll
[1:21:18] be looking for it to next day if it
[1:21:20] ain't there the next day I'll be looking
[1:21:22] for the next day if it ain't there at
[1:21:24] breakfast I'll be looking for it at
[1:21:26] lunch if it ain't at lunch I'll be
[1:21:27] looking for it at
[1:21:29] dinner and if you eat a midnight snack
[1:21:31] I'll be looking for it at the midnight
[1:21:36] snack ain't nothing wrong with
[1:21:40] that that's having the right perception
[1:21:43] the prophet said Believers when they
[1:21:45] receive a promise from God they're on
[1:21:47] their
[1:21:51] toes
[1:21:54] I wonder how many times Mr skeptic come
[1:21:57] along to him and said you ain't no boat
[1:22:00] builder you're nothing but a
[1:22:02] farmer who told you you could build a
[1:22:04] boat
[1:22:06] rightow well according to my abilities
[1:22:09] I'm disqualified but according to what
[1:22:11] he
[1:22:14] said I wonder how many times Mr skeptic
[1:22:18] looked at him and said H what do you
[1:22:21] think this is going to do putting a
[1:22:23] window clear up there three
[1:22:26] floors what in the world are you
[1:22:30] thinking getting wood wood that is so
[1:22:33] soft right soft to where he couldn't
[1:22:37] even take one test or trial without
[1:22:40] breaking oh but what you don't know it
[1:22:43] will not be the wood itself of its own
[1:22:45] fibers that will withstand the test and
[1:22:48] trials it will be the pitch of the
[1:22:50] atonement that is so wo into those
[1:22:53] fibers that will give it the ability to
[1:22:57] ride in the waters of
[1:23:00] judgment Skeptics coming to him Mr
[1:23:03] impatient how long you going to spend on
[1:23:06] that floor well I'm going to stay here
[1:23:09] until God tells me to move to the next
[1:23:11] floor how long are you going to continue
[1:23:14] to pray about that in your life I'm
[1:23:15] going to stand here claim that promise
[1:23:17] and pray about this until he tells me go
[1:23:20] to the next floor
[1:23:24] you see how do we defeat the enemy by
[1:23:27] standing on the word that God has given
[1:23:31] you don't have to explain it you don't
[1:23:33] have to have a whole Litany of quotes to
[1:23:36] do it or a whole thing of scriptures
[1:23:39] stand on the word that God has given
[1:23:42] [Music]
[1:23:45] you I wish I could preach right
[1:23:51] now
[1:23:53] they shall
[1:23:54] recover brother B takes them three guys
[1:23:57] Mr unbeliever skeptic and Mr impatient
[1:24:00] he talks about all them guys coming
[1:24:02] through you know Mr unbeliever he goes
[1:24:04] out right away brother B says ain't
[1:24:06] nothing to it and then he talk about how
[1:24:08] that you know Mr skeptic said you know I
[1:24:10] I went down to a meeting they were
[1:24:12] preaching the word and here I am sitting
[1:24:14] you know five years later I suffer with
[1:24:17] this for 15 years and 5 years later and
[1:24:19] I still got it so he just throws it
[1:24:22] aside right well there ain't nothing
[1:24:24] wrong with the
[1:24:25] promise there ain't nothing wrong with
[1:24:28] God then brother BR tells us even Mr
[1:24:31] impatient he said Mr impatient even set
[1:24:33] in the service and God under the
[1:24:34] anointing where it said if you shall say
[1:24:36] to this mountain be thou removed and if
[1:24:38] remove and don't doubt in your heart he
[1:24:40] said Mr impatient actually looked down
[1:24:42] at his legs and said legs you're not
[1:24:44] going to be crippled no more in the name
[1:24:46] of Jesus Christ but a little bit of time
[1:24:49] went by and Mr impatient said you you
[1:24:52] know what I got under that inspiration
[1:24:54] and there ain't a bit
[1:24:59] changed that's good this is this and
[1:25:01] this is I'm just paraphrasing the words
[1:25:03] actually quoting what the prophet said
[1:25:06] to me this is very powerful of how that
[1:25:08] things a pi can come under the
[1:25:10] inspiration and yet what it comes down
[1:25:12] to it really doesn't matter if you feel
[1:25:15] anything or not it's about when you're
[1:25:17] willing willing to stand on God's word
[1:25:19] it drops in your heart and you say you
[1:25:21] know what this is my promise I may not
[1:25:23] feel no different I may not feel
[1:25:25] anything but God said it and if I need a
[1:25:28] feeling God will give me a feeling he'll
[1:25:30] give what I have need
[1:25:33] of Hall think about that little woman we
[1:25:37] talked about her last week that little
[1:25:39] woman you know of the that uh of the
[1:25:42] zerath and here she was down there you
[1:25:45] know brother Bram would say it in one
[1:25:47] place of the message that it seemed it
[1:25:49] seemed like to her that God had forgot
[1:25:53] about her she was a real believer he
[1:25:57] said it would seem like to her she's
[1:25:58] pray she's standing on the word and yet
[1:26:01] God is
[1:26:02] silent I tell you we know where that
[1:26:05] stands as Believers there's sometimes
[1:26:08] where here you're praying about things
[1:26:10] and blessings might be dropping all
[1:26:12] around
[1:26:13] you but not on
[1:26:16] you sometimes God comes to test Us in
[1:26:19] that way to see what will you do
[1:26:24] will you still love me just as
[1:26:26] much will you trust me oh my oh I'm glad
[1:26:32] that God brings us into these moments to
[1:26:34] help us reflect friends I'm glad about
[1:26:37] he's a father and he's training us he's
[1:26:40] teaching us chastening itself is not all
[1:26:45] about correction matter of fact that
[1:26:47] word chastening it deals with the whole
[1:26:49] training of the child it's it's God
[1:26:52] training you and I God teaching you and
[1:26:55] I that's right brother Bram said
[1:26:59] sometimes this is out to be certain of
[1:27:00] God I'm just trying to Lord have mercy
[1:27:02] time I don't know where time goes he
[1:27:05] said how to he be certain of God brother
[1:27:08] BR said that little woman she knew that
[1:27:10] he was God and as the barrel went down
[1:27:12] down down down circumstances got worse
[1:27:14] and worse all the time but God was
[1:27:17] letting it get that way he just loves to
[1:27:20] do that he loves to put your faith to a
[1:27:23] test to see how you act on it let you be
[1:27:27] anointed and prayed for then make you
[1:27:31] worse say come on Satan put him to the
[1:27:34] test I know he believes me bless God
[1:27:38] forever oh my put him to a test now I
[1:27:41] know he took my word for it brother B
[1:27:43] said could he say that about
[1:27:46] you wow
[1:27:49] yeah I want to refer this
[1:27:53] refer this in a situation let me just
[1:27:56] say it like
[1:27:58] this when we think about times a lot of
[1:28:01] these things we think how in the
[1:28:02] world when you sometimes maybe could
[1:28:05] look back to the martyrs before you
[1:28:06] think how how in the world could I have
[1:28:09] done that there you you would have done
[1:28:13] that there just like you're doing it
[1:28:16] now the prophet tells us he said through
[1:28:19] your daily
[1:28:20] striving it's the same
[1:28:22] faith of the crowns of the
[1:28:27] martyrs God gives like brother B will go
[1:28:30] on to say he said for every one of them
[1:28:31] polycarp and the rest he said God gave
[1:28:34] he gives Supreme
[1:28:37] Grace for the Supreme
[1:28:40] hour you see what it is sometimes listen
[1:28:43] don't let the devil worry you and go
[1:28:45] well I don't know if I got rapturing
[1:28:46] faith I don't know it listen when you
[1:28:49] have need of rapturing faith it will
[1:28:52] will be
[1:28:54] there you say give me scripture on that
[1:28:56] glad you asked Genesis 22 Abraham said I
[1:29:00] am the lad are going to go Yonder and
[1:29:01] worship and come again how do you know
[1:29:04] that Abraham because God told me to go
[1:29:07] offer him up and he gave everything he
[1:29:09] had yes and Abraham heard the ram caught
[1:29:14] in a Thicket God gave rapturing faith
[1:29:18] when it was needed yes God giv
[1:29:22] what you have need of when you have need
[1:29:24] of
[1:29:29] it

[1:29:33] have just a few more moments please
[1:29:35] there's a sister this this testimony is
[1:29:38] been a testimony that uh listening
[1:29:41] through the message and out of the
[1:29:43] message OD Oddball and I I'm not going
[1:29:45] to maybe uh read it or maybe I should
[1:29:48] read it out of the message Oddball cuz I
[1:29:50] don't want to butcher it up but out of
[1:29:51] the message Oddball and brother R's
[1:29:53] talking about out of Chicago and he says
[1:29:54] how many know
[1:29:56] sister I don't know how to pronounce
[1:29:58] that name but say it againi putti that
[1:30:02] sounds like coming from a really Tiano
[1:30:05] from Chicago from
[1:30:07] Chicago yeah she had a mental nervous
[1:30:11] breakdown just recently very very bad
[1:30:14] but the morning in Chicago at the
[1:30:16] Christian business Men's breakfast I
[1:30:18] told the sister under the inspiration of
[1:30:20] the Holy Spirit she came back to one
[1:30:22] side and she couldn't hold herself
[1:30:24] together and I said sister you won't get
[1:30:27] over it right away but you're going to
[1:30:30] be well I said it'll either be 18 months
[1:30:34] or two years right in that bracket
[1:30:37] you'll be made well now the other day he
[1:30:40] says while speaking with her I heard her
[1:30:42] testifying so happy the happiest she had
[1:30:45] ever been in all her life she was riding
[1:30:48] in a car she had no peace the Pres
[1:30:51] presence of God seemed to have departed
[1:30:53] from her of course it was mental nerve
[1:30:57] you know and all of a sudden it returned
[1:31:00] with a great flow of joy and the power
[1:31:03] of the Holy Spirit was upon her she wept
[1:31:07] she cried she had a great time three or
[1:31:09] four weeks ago or month she and I heard
[1:31:11] her Testify the Sunday before laugh and
[1:31:13] said brother Brandon when I got back I
[1:31:15] marked down and took that tape and it
[1:31:18] was exactly 18 months to the day if she
[1:31:22] could take a
[1:31:24] promise take a tape and say God made a
[1:31:28] promise to me on this tape how much more
[1:31:31] you and I we could pick up our phone
[1:31:34] listening to a message listening to a
[1:31:36] scripture and it's inspired to you and I
[1:31:39] I tell you what I believe I'd put that
[1:31:41] thing on my screen my lock screen I
[1:31:44] believe I'd put it on my Opening screen
[1:31:46] I believe I put it as a notification as
[1:31:49] a reminder that God had me in
[1:31:55] [Applause]
[1:32:00] mind I wish I could just preach on that
[1:32:08] point how many knows that sometimes
[1:32:10] things don't always don't always happen
[1:32:13] the way that we think it's going to
[1:32:18] happen Bria if you jump down to that
[1:32:21] paragraph it says says it's in the
[1:32:22] message the unchangeable god it says now
[1:32:24] the thing is with the people it's that
[1:32:27] paragraph says now the thing is with the
[1:32:29] people now he's talking about taking
[1:32:31] God's word Above This taking his word
[1:32:33] planting the word and watering
[1:32:37] it said many times you said we want to
[1:32:40] make an idol out of God we ask God to do
[1:32:44] something and then he must do it just
[1:32:47] the way we ask it or we'll say he never
[1:32:51] answer answered when we do that we waken
[1:32:55] we weaken our faith in God and we weaken
[1:33:01] Our Testimony when we do not take him at
[1:33:05] his
[1:33:09] word God always
[1:33:12] answers yes ask and you shall receive
[1:33:16] seek and you shall find everyone that
[1:33:19] asks will receive everyone that seeks
[1:33:23] shall find everyone that knocks it'll be
[1:33:26] open to them that's the only way that
[1:33:28] I've always found it that I can get
[1:33:30] anything from God is take him at his
[1:33:33] word believe it the way he sends
[1:33:37] it he said now if we do not take it just
[1:33:39] the way that we think or it don't come
[1:33:42] that way we've built God as an idol he's
[1:33:45] got to answer just according to our ways
[1:33:48] or well it's just no good he didn't
[1:33:50] answer us God answers in many
[1:33:55] ways he answers in Peculiar ways times
[1:34:00] and everything is
[1:34:03] odd
[1:34:12] Hallelujah yes
[1:34:16] sir my this is why my even with all this
[1:34:21] with looking at at this let me just let
[1:34:23] me just stay with this part of it here
[1:34:25] tonight I remember when brother remember
[1:34:27] when brother Brandon was called to go
[1:34:28] down to
[1:34:29] miltown and uh he heard that crying of
[1:34:32] that little lamb in the midst of all
[1:34:35] those Thorns M Town was Georgie Carter
[1:34:40] brother Brandon went down down there and
[1:34:41] I I've been privileged to go down there
[1:34:44] been privileged to see where that little
[1:34:45] church was at and see where that house
[1:34:47] was at and we parked right there in
[1:34:49] front of it and and look at that those
[1:34:51] those moments you know it kind of gives
[1:34:53] you a visual of the things that you know
[1:34:56] because all of us sometimes when you
[1:34:57] read things we all get in our minds how
[1:34:59] things may be looked and things like
[1:35:01] that and that's just natural you know
[1:35:03] there a part of it to us but anyhow
[1:35:06] brother Bram when he goes down there he
[1:35:07] he don't he doesn't understand every
[1:35:10] every step of the way when he gets down
[1:35:12] there and you know uh one of the
[1:35:14] brothers there Mr Wright or brother
[1:35:16] Wright actually said I got to go down
[1:35:17] that way and sell some things anyhow at
[1:35:19] the market so brother Bram when he goes
[1:35:21] around you know there's something about
[1:35:23] a a church and he goes to that church or
[1:35:25] he goes by that church and you know
[1:35:27] something kept saying to him go over to
[1:35:29] the church go over to the church and
[1:35:33] brother Bram said you know I I'm just
[1:35:35] going to let me stand here till I uh
[1:35:37] till you go up on the hill he told
[1:35:39] Brother Wright that and he said um he
[1:35:42] asked brother Wright he said are they
[1:35:43] having Church there NOP and then now in
[1:35:46] in this message here I think I got this
[1:35:47] one this part in Brianna brother
[1:35:50] brandham says out of that message faith
[1:35:52] is the Sixth Sense he said I tried to
[1:35:54] open the door and the door wouldn't come
[1:35:56] open now
[1:35:58] remember he has received a voice that
[1:36:00] said go over to that
[1:36:02] church so well you don't just go over to
[1:36:05] the church just probably stand
[1:36:07] outside he goes over
[1:36:10] it and it won't come open he said
[1:36:13] heavenly father and this is what I want
[1:36:14] you to know it's very simple heavenly
[1:36:16] father is there something about this
[1:36:18] church the reason you called me is this
[1:36:21] Church what's all wound up in the brush
[1:36:24] is this what you're hollering miltown is
[1:36:27] this where you want me open that door
[1:36:29] for me I took a hold of the door it
[1:36:32] wouldn't
[1:36:33] open
[1:36:35] wow but I thought the Bible said when
[1:36:38] you pray believe what you have that you
[1:36:41] receive it that's true but it's
[1:36:44] according to how God gives
[1:36:47] it there was nothing wrong with the
[1:36:49] prophet praying that and saying the Lord
[1:36:51] is this it why did you send me over here
[1:36:53] and he prays and that he reaches to open
[1:36:55] the door and it don't come open you know
[1:36:57] why that was not the way that God was
[1:36:59] going to open the
[1:37:01] door about that time some man came
[1:37:04] walking around the church said how do
[1:37:06] you do I said how do you do sir do you
[1:37:08] want in that church yes sir I got the
[1:37:11] key and he opened the
[1:37:13] door so just because something hasn't
[1:37:17] moved when you prayed stay where God has
[1:37:21] told you to
[1:37:24] go he's got somebody and it ain't a man
[1:37:27] it ain't somebody like that but God
[1:37:29] knows how to bring the key that you'll
[1:37:31] recognize this is the
[1:37:33] key this is how I get
[1:37:39] in let me just read this last quote is
[1:37:41] that all
[1:37:50] right
[1:37:52] Oh
[1:37:53] Glory brother Brandon here in the
[1:37:55] message believe in God I I love this
[1:37:58] quote he said if God come down and
[1:38:01] healed me positive right out with a
[1:38:06] miracle it wouldn't be as great as it
[1:38:09] would if I can see the promise of God
[1:38:13] and take it into my
[1:38:17] heart that right there when you make a
[1:38:20] statement like that especially here
[1:38:22] amongst Pentecostal peoples that right
[1:38:24] there that
[1:38:26] perception but see what we're talking
[1:38:28] about is Royal Seed of Abraham Abraham
[1:38:32] went for 25 years sure Abraham has his
[1:38:36] ups and downs but Abraham believed god
[1:38:40] what happened as Abraham get back up his
[1:38:42] faith he's looking to God and God's
[1:38:45] directing him and his faith would grow
[1:38:47] stronger and stronger and stronger as a
[1:38:50] matter of fact brother B said when I get
[1:38:51] the feeling gloomy and
[1:38:54] blue he said I read Romans
[1:38:57] 4 and in this very very quote right here
[1:39:00] brother Brian that I read after he gets
[1:39:01] done reading Romans 4 this is the
[1:39:03] statement I don't have it up there but
[1:39:04] this is what he makes After reading
[1:39:06] Romans 4 where Abraham staggered not at
[1:39:09] the promise of God he said I could just
[1:39:11] hit the devil in the face with that for
[1:39:13] 365 days a year you're a liar this is
[1:39:16] the word and I'm
[1:39:18] healed amen that's right doesn't matter
[1:39:22] what I feel like doesn't matter what it
[1:39:23] looks like
[1:39:25] amen they shall lay hands on the sick
[1:39:28] and they
[1:39:30] shall
[1:39:33] recover could we stand
[1:39:36] together brother Bram says if he come
[1:39:38] down and healed me positive right out
[1:39:40] with a miracle it wouldn't be as great
[1:39:41] as if as it would if I could see the
[1:39:44] promise of God and take it into my heart
[1:39:48] stand there and I can say Jesus is is
[1:39:52] now healing me for I have accepted his
[1:39:56] word it's in my heart he is now
[1:40:00] interceding for me before the father I
[1:40:03] shall be well there is what God loves
[1:40:09] stand there on his word and say it's
[1:40:12] right he is healing me now every
[1:40:19] day
[1:40:22] what a perception
[1:40:24] yeah what a perception
[1:40:28] yeah sometimes the way things like I
[1:40:30] said they didn't haven't worked out the
[1:40:32] way
[1:40:33] that maybe I thought they'd work
[1:40:36] out hav't worked out and when things
[1:40:38] that I've prayed for hasn't come exactly
[1:40:39] how I thought it was going to
[1:40:42] be I know I'm speaking we speaking for
[1:40:45] everybody
[1:40:46] here that's right when whether it's been
[1:40:50] healing
[1:40:52] whether it's
[1:40:53] been praying for
[1:40:56] deliverance even for someone praying for
[1:40:59] some sometimes things itself they don't
[1:41:01] they you know what it is God shows us
[1:41:04] that he's still
[1:41:06] God and our perception sometimes we've
[1:41:09] all been there we maybe maybe even here
[1:41:12] tonight if we could just looking at and
[1:41:13] say Lord the thing I want to do is I
[1:41:17] might have an expectation but the thing
[1:41:19] that I want more than any anything else
[1:41:21] in the meantime while I'm waiting on you
[1:41:25] to fulfill that promise that you have
[1:41:27] made to me I just want to fall more in
[1:41:30] love with you Lord just let more of the
[1:41:34] love of
[1:41:36] God let it just come down more into me
[1:41:38] Lord yes Lord give me the strength I may
[1:41:42] need make me help me to be more patient
[1:41:45] help me the Lord through the me meantime
[1:41:48] while I'm waiting and through this test
[1:41:52] as I see the right perception it's not
[1:41:54] that you dislike me more than somebody
[1:41:56] else God doesn't have favorites in his
[1:41:58] kingdom God doesn't do
[1:42:01] that God doesn't do that God loves his
[1:42:06] children amen all the same offices gifts
[1:42:10] that that's not that's not a
[1:42:12] determination of God's love it's just
[1:42:14] those those are things that go into the
[1:42:16] body as God sets and there's
[1:42:17] responsibilities that comes with it but
[1:42:19] as far as God's love
[1:42:21] his love is elective his love is not
[1:42:24] more for for this person than it is for
[1:42:27] you God's love is the same for each one
[1:42:31] of his
[1:42:32] children but if in the midst of this
[1:42:34] time if you you know look friends even
[1:42:36] in this moment as I think we've looked
[1:42:38] at this if we can find ourselves in this
[1:42:40] place that we find thoughts and other
[1:42:42] things like that coming in say God I
[1:42:46] want what the prophet said an
[1:42:49] overflowing baptism
[1:42:51] of love I want
[1:42:54] more I want more of the love of
[1:42:59] God let's just bow our heads in a word
[1:43:01] of
[1:43:03] prayer heavenly
[1:43:07] father my Lord how that you have taken
[1:43:10] this
[1:43:11] [Music]
[1:43:13] tonight you know
[1:43:15] Lord every need and you know the hearts
[1:43:18] of your
[1:43:19] children
[1:43:21] Lord as I sat there Lord even earlier
[1:43:23] and left the office here and then on my
[1:43:25] way back here Lord my heart just
[1:43:28] burdened Lord which way do I
[1:43:31] go Lord I certainly believe with all my
[1:43:35] heart that you gave us Lord the that
[1:43:38] final nudge that was needed
[1:43:43] Lord Lord I Thank you I I don't want to
[1:43:47] take time but I realize that Lord years
[1:43:50] and years years
[1:43:51] ago it would have been Lord a greater
[1:43:55] struggle maybe there would have been
[1:43:56] something Lord I would have just taken a
[1:43:58] message cuz I was so nervous and went
[1:44:00] and preached
[1:44:01] it Lord You've you've helped
[1:44:04] me you've taught me Lord through various
[1:44:07] things and I'm still learning
[1:44:10] Papa Lord maybe through this Lord just
[1:44:13] that little bit of an Insight that your
[1:44:15] children could
[1:44:16] see sometimes Lord that things that we
[1:44:18] may not have a clear Direction or a
[1:44:21] clear
[1:44:22] answer we know where we're to be but I
[1:44:24] don't know Lord I'm standing seemingly
[1:44:27] like a fork in the road I I don't know
[1:44:29] Lord which direction but Lord if we can
[1:44:31] just
[1:44:32] stand just stand still Lord and just
[1:44:36] look to you and father you make known
[1:44:39] your will you you give that unction that
[1:44:41] we need Lord for that
[1:44:43] moment father there's needs that have
[1:44:47] we've read and that's upon hearts
[1:44:50] there's prayers Lord that's been prayed
[1:44:53] maybe there's hearts Lord here tonight
[1:44:55] that they have received a promise from
[1:44:58] you and like that little sister from
[1:45:01] Chicago that the prophet tells us about
[1:45:03] at the end of the
[1:45:05] Oddball you could have you could have
[1:45:08] told her when she was going through that
[1:45:12] time right then and there it could have
[1:45:14] just ceased but I believe Lord you
[1:45:17] included that not just so you could
[1:45:19] prove
[1:45:21] her stand as a
[1:45:22] Believer Lord I I want to believe I
[1:45:26] believe that you included and allowed
[1:45:28] these examples to be included for
[1:45:32] us you did it for us Lord that we can
[1:45:35] look in your word and like the prophet
[1:45:37] talks about how that prosecutor over and
[1:45:40] over wants to bring all kinds of
[1:45:41] accusations against you and say that you
[1:45:46] you failed to keep your word but yet
[1:45:49] Lord in even in that portion of
[1:45:51] scripture they shall
[1:45:53] recover you never gave a
[1:45:56] timeline you never even said how that
[1:45:59] recovery would take place but all
[1:46:02] healing comes from you Lord yes it does
[1:46:06] so may we lord like the prophet said
[1:46:08] when in that opening of that quote Lord
[1:46:11] because we don't we don't want to put
[1:46:13] you Lord in a place to where you've got
[1:46:14] to answer things the way that we think
[1:46:16] it's got to be Lord I know sometimes in
[1:46:19] our Humanity certain things every one of
[1:46:22] us Lord we've wanted certain things
[1:46:24] maybe to be a certain way sometimes it's
[1:46:26] because we looked at maybe it was more
[1:46:28] glorious that it would be this way it
[1:46:30] would bring more glory to God and yet
[1:46:32] father your Prophet would stand there in
[1:46:35] believing God I believe that was
[1:46:36] preached over in Pennsylvania here and
[1:46:38] he would stand there and tell us there's
[1:46:41] nothing even more greater than even if
[1:46:44] you were to heal us positive right now
[1:46:46] by a miracle there's nothing more
[1:46:47] greater than to be able to take your
[1:46:49] word and stand on that promise and say
[1:46:52] even now he is healing
[1:46:55] me oh God I believe that tonight that
[1:46:59] Lord that not only for the healing and
[1:47:01] the body but I believe God as your
[1:47:03] children that we can stand here tonight
[1:47:05] and say even now I a part of this
[1:47:09] Rapture I'm a part of Jesus Christ I I
[1:47:13] may not see everything yet but I I'm a
[1:47:16] part of it I'm a part of it I know where
[1:47:19] my heart is that I I know I I I see in
[1:47:22] my life I see his life coming out I I
[1:47:25] know his desires are moving through me I
[1:47:29] know what I
[1:47:31] was and I know what I am now I may not
[1:47:35] be what I want to be or what I should be
[1:47:37] but I know I'm not what I used to
[1:47:39] be so even now the Rapture is working in
[1:47:46] me oh God help us Lord I pray
[1:47:51] if there's one Lord that hasn't received
[1:47:53] Lord of that love of God Lord in their
[1:47:56] heart would you just Lord right now Lord
[1:48:00] Lord God just in the
[1:48:03] Simplicity of taking you at your word I
[1:48:06] hear how your Prophet would say it at
[1:48:08] the end of three kinds of Believers he
[1:48:10] said if you from the very bottom of your
[1:48:12] heart can mean it from the depths of
[1:48:14] your heart receive it right
[1:48:17] now Lord granted I pray
[1:48:21] granted Lord we want to stand like that
[1:48:25] Mama deer
[1:48:26] stood that one Bert's heart when Mama
[1:48:31] deer came out there and stood knowing
[1:48:34] that that Hunter was there knowing that
[1:48:36] the sights was on her she could smell
[1:48:38] him she knew it was there but the
[1:48:41] Instinct in her was drawn out when she
[1:48:45] heard that call of a baby deer of a fawn
[1:48:50] Lord God as your children in this
[1:48:52] hour father may we not look Lord for so
[1:48:56] much that it has to be walking on the
[1:48:58] water of this but lord it's simply even
[1:49:00] in everyday life standing on the word of
[1:49:05] God when the enemy would want to come
[1:49:07] and say that don't apply to you there's
[1:49:09] an instinct that rises on the inside but
[1:49:12] God has said so maybe when co-workers
[1:49:15] and workers maybe people at school maybe
[1:49:18] family Maybe different ones things could
[1:49:22] be said but there is an
[1:49:24] instinct that'll rise from the
[1:49:27] inside now Lord your Prophet called
[1:49:30] those instincts that was in the geese
[1:49:31] that would cause them together the cows
[1:49:33] together in the middle of the field when
[1:49:35] there's going to be an earthquake he
[1:49:36] said I call that
[1:49:39] God Lord Jesus that's what we call it
[1:49:41] Lord It's you
[1:49:44] father it's you that we love help us
[1:49:47] Lord I pray may you Lord I I pray I I
[1:49:51] need more Lord I'm not ashamed to say
[1:49:55] that you know that's Lord something I've
[1:49:57] been praying and I ask Lord God I need
[1:50:00] more of the love of
[1:50:02] God more of it Lord I Want More Lord of
[1:50:06] that overflowing abundance Lord just
[1:50:10] taking over my life Lord flooding
[1:50:13] through Lord all my perspectives and
[1:50:17] perceptions let it just be Jesus
[1:50:21] granted Lord help us I pray
[1:50:23] tonight thank you Father thank you for
