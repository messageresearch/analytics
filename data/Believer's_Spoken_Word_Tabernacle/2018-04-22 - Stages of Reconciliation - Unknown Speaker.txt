like I've been I was battling in the first part of March and then even throughout this week and coming into yesterday I'm not complaining I'm just asking for your prayers I I had they went in there yesterday I got there such a place and you know you're hearing that everything and they said I had bronchitis and I'm saying I feel like I'm not even getting over this you know don't worry I'm not

things just got going you know and but we certainly just so we're so appreciative of the mercy of God I tell you what a what a wonderful time we're living in I really mean it just the word of the Lord just continues to become more and more real more more simple more simpler I just love how it just God just continues to condon send and make himself known to us and we just thank God for that good to see each and every one of you I know we have some visitors and maybe I'm overlooking of where they're at but god bless you it's good to see you with the brother/sister keener god bless you have a baptism today brother Jose gonna be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and so we want to thank God for that I'm also gonna ask that you just remember me in prayer that goes right now I've been scheduled to be down in some meetings in Blacksburg Virginia since back in January but I just need I need a touch from the Lord just a that I need a touch from God with the Lord just to give me strength if that's to do that in the meantime brother Boaz Romero live he will be here next next Sunday so I'll be here Lord willing with we'll be here together on Thursday but sometimes I don't see something you want Thursday and so I just kind of want to let you know that just if you would just keep that in prayer that the Lord will be mindful or is a number of Ministers there will be where brother Shawn Martin is hosting the meetings and I know we'll be there together so I think that's about it it's good to be here well let's let's look into the word this morning if we could let's open the Colossians chapter 1 and just see how the Lord will just guide us here you just pray for me this morning I'll try to preach boy it sounds like I'm complaining doing it I'm asking for your help this morning Colossians chapter 1 verse 12 we'll read just a few verses of Scripture then we'll just ask the blog Lord's blessing verse 12 in Colossians 1 giving thanks unto the Father which hath made us meet and that word meet there has made us able to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light so we were ordained to this but we needed him to bring us to our inheritance who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sins who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature for by him we're all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist let's just bow our heads for a few moments Heavenly Father Lord you see Lord God here this morning as we have Lord come together Lord with one purpose on mind Lord your God we want to draw closer to you so we ask that Lord knowing that as you have given to us in your word it says draw nigh unto God and He will draw nigh unto you and father we realize that that's just simply even the turning of our thoughts and where Lord even in our thoughts and our hearts we welcome you Lord then father you're able to move down Lord through those channels and speak to us and draw us closer to you you're able to remove Lord and dissolve anything that would be a hindrance Lord you're able to so speak and move upon our lives to give us the authority that already lays within us but you are able to make it known to us Lord to be able to rise above Lord everything I pray that you'll help us this morning may you come and take me as a speaker Lord and take your your people Lord take us together Lord may you just be glorified and our midst and in our lives Lord and just speak your word to our hearts we pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen god bless you may be seated if you don't mind if you keep your Bibles open there or follow along with me I want to I want to speak on a thought here has just been a very prevailing fought over for quite a long time but on reconciliation but I want to just deal with it in the in the thought line this morning on stages of reconciliation with a real direction on the cost of it you know this is a time that we're living in in this world where there's a lot of things that are being brought together and you there's a lot of things that are moving together even very quickly and yet within it all when we look at what with reconciling there is a there's a great there's a cost that must be met in order to reconcile many times when you you look at one of the top reasons why that there are just lower these the monitors just a tad Bend just a tad because I do need them just attend one of the main causes and one of the things that we find that even when marriages themselves are dissolved they they term that there are irreconcilable differences that means things that they cannot come together on so we recognize that within that and when we think of that within marriage just in the natural there is definitely differences and we see those differences as a matter of fact we see faults and mistakes everything else and within that it really truly takes the grace of God and to be able to move those parts together to where that differences themselves to where it becomes reconcilable because if it's not reconciled then the difference continues to remain there and it remains to be a point of contention a point that doesn't allow a further uniting and so there's stages to all of that there first of all has to be an acknowledgment of the wrong that's done there's got to be not just an acknowledgement of it but coming from from deep within to allow those things to move and then allow the healing and to allow things for reconciliation to come I'm not gonna deal so much with all marriages today I what I'm dealing with is this and I trust that the Lord will help us to be able to see that how that these things it moves in every facet in every part of life of how that this is applied in everything because I believe this with all my self I believe it with all my heart I always have believed it this way it's where I'm minister it I don't believe let me just give an example I don't believe that the seals are just doctrine if it's just stays as doctrine Satan can run haywire but it's got to come to where that word that comes forth it must come to a discernment and application in our lives to be able to expose sin that's the real Ministry of the word that it gets down into our lives because if as far as doctrines and mysteries look we all enjoy that but it's good God's desire was that these things would become an application in our life not something that we just fellowship about but through the application we actually are coming in under the blood into fellowship of the mystery itself which is Christ so that's that's that's the whole there's an objective there's a purpose here so when we look at this let's just move on into the word here and just allow the Lord just to speak to us in verse 18 continuing on it says he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence so his desire to have the preeminence he himself took it upon himself to bring this about to where he might have the preeminence for it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell you think of this at how that God God created himself a body to come down and dwell in Jesus was not the second person because you you're not redeemed in order to be redeemed it's very simple if you have your watch that's in a pawn shop that belongs to you and you have to go to the pawn shop and get the watch out you are redeeming what belongs to you so that is exactly with God it was God coming down creating a body a tabernacle that he purposed to reveal himself with the whole purpose in order to die that he might redeem you and I so there's a purpose within it when you think of it here the Lord Jesus in the very we could say peak of his life he's thirty three and a half years old he doesn't die of old age but here he is as the Lamb of God here God comes down and takes upon this body this tabernacle that he's created for this purpose to where Paul would pick it up and he says when he bringeth the Sun into the world he said lo a body hast thou prepared for me and we know that the son coming into the world this is the word this is God condescending from the supernatural from that of invisible God coming into the supernatural the image of the word and then from the word here coming and coming down and the word becoming flesh it's God condescending the whole time to be come from word to flesh so all of it is God condescending and this is a part I want you to catch this now and maybe let me just drop this with you reconciliation requires condescension so in order to count in sin and what you think of this in order to come dance it we can look at this and we can see God came down came down and he created a tabernacle to dwell in I want you to think of this this body that God created and came and lived in how unfitting in in in one aspect of it because here God had to create a body that would come through and by the woman because of the fall and in that body here is age the age the wrinkled memory when they looked at him and he said before Abraham was I am and they said you're not a man more than 50 years old you think you look older I look old differently the burden it was so age him to wear but in this God here created a tabernacle that he could come in and dwell among you and I in order to redeem us but it's we need to look deeper and we need to look further back than just the expression here in this tabernacle and this condescension we need to recognize that that condescension first began in the very mind of God it was not something that just came here in time humility already was there in God God had already laid it out that I I'm gonna come down and redeem and bring my children back to myself it was all part of his plan but this condescension it all starts with humility it's the same way in our lives it's not just a happening it starts inwardly the Bible says in first Timothy 3:16 without controversy great is the mystery of godliness God was manifest in the flesh Jesus Christ is God God was manifest in the flesh not a portion the very fullness he was justified in the spirit seen of angels preached unto the Gentiles believed on in the world and received up into glory so when we look at this at this Scripture that weird well it on for it please the father that in him should all the fullness dwell we recognize that coming here to the River Jordan and how that here is the Lamb of God here is this tabernacle here's the temple there's the son of God and here he is coming to the River Jordan and we see how that God has everything is lining up where God has a messenger on earth that's identifying the time and he's calling the people to repentance he's pointing them he's preparing the way and then here steps forward the tabernacle the dwelling place where God is going to take his abode in order to redeem then through this we find very a very important part that this reconciling in order to reconcile it's to bring together like nature's reconciliation cannot take place without like nature's so there must be like nature's now the Spirit of God would move upon the prophets it wouldn't the Spirit of God would move upon the elect of God down through time who were looking for the lamb to come or what had been revealed to them but they never had experienced redemption in the reality of where that God himself would take up residency in their life and fully quicken the seed that couldn't be done the Spirit of God would move upon him then it would pull back but here at the River Jordan as he said on whom thou see the Spirit descend and remain the same is he so when we look at this in must be like nature's the Dove would have never let down on a wolf is that right these are very this some familiar terminology to you the Dove would have never let down on a wolf so it had to be like nature's come together now here the only one that could do that here God steps forward and God is reconciling himself with man as he takes his body he takes the very son he takes him to himself and here God steps into that vessel and God himself that's is why that in itself is the greatest event to take place because if that had not taken taken place then we would have never we would not have been redeemed so in order for us to be redeemed first of all like natures this had to be reconciled God had to reconcile with man God had to become one of us so it's a stage here showing that only like natures and that this is a parallel this is a parallel and we don't want to just leave it in a spiritual level here we see it on the day of Pentecost when they went up there to the upper room the word I want you just to catch this the word when Christ Himself when the Lord Jesus rose from the grave he began to assemble and he came and appeared to his disciples the Bible says apostles who were chosen and had began to make himself known to them after million many infallible proofs and instructing them on things concerning the kingdom of God for forty days now I want you to watch the effect of this word the effect of the word here going forth we see it moves to a place to where we then have a hundred and twenty vessels that now are going to the upper room and the Bible declares to us that they were of one mind at a one accord so the word itself coming forth after the blood has been shed is a word that is setting the people in order for full reconciliation so just the recognition of the word was not reconciliation yet it is a stage of it to recognize that he raised from the grave hope this is him that was not full reconciliation but it was a necessary stage so there's stages of reconciliation there's a parallel to all of this it's the same way when it comes to our homes it must be like nature's was getting quiet in here now said but saying it's easier to part the Red Sea but this is what I want you to see God has so put us together even though we're different as far as in our makeup and how God would bring together a husband and a wife but how do you say well blow seven when this a situation has come up or this thing how does it come to a place of light natures it comes to back to the resolve of the right purpose what's the purpose where's the where's the unifying tie because there's all there's many things that can come that can try to dissolve even that union but see everything has to work it has to be it has to work now you can look at like this and say I need God to make my wife to where she's a little bit more tender wonder who he's gonna use I need God to work on my husband he needs to become a little bit more lamb-like wonder who God's gonna use see when we're looking at this in part of reconciliation it all starts with there's a need there's a need then it moves as we said before before condescension that we see condensation that we see has to have already started within where the person was condom sending within who that's that's the real that's the real real reality it's condescension within then it manifest without is that true with the word we first have to humble ourselves and condon send within to the word then it's manifest without the the woman the syrophoenician woman look remember what the Lord Jesus said I'm not even sent to your dogs but what did she do she conned and send it how did she conned in sin whence what she spoke out she this is where she was at in her heart she placed herself lower and she received she received in what we see is oh how she condescended she placed herself down but where did that begin inwardly she was in his presence and inwardly she condescended sometimes you may not see the results that you want to see sometimes we want to take our hands and try to do this but listen all of this out here is not is not where things happen it happens to where we see things but the reality is it must start here and then come out here has I start in here so here let's look at these stages here in second Corinthians 5:18 I'm just gonna move just real quickly over to this in 2nd Corinthians 5:18 it says and all things are of God who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ so all things are of God this is this is God's doing this is not your doing or my doing this is God's doing well you know I wanted to be I wanted to be saved and that's why Jesus Christ came the reason that you had a desire is because that was already in you God already placed that there in you and God stirs up that desire of which is a first and that thirst can try to be satisfied by many other things and yet leaving a person empty because there's only one thing that can truly quench that thirst and that desire that is within that God is placed there and that is God himself hallelujah so all things are of God who hath not what should watch this who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and hath given to us the Ministry of reconciliation now here here's here's this Ministry of reconciliation I'm not going to deal too much on that this morning to wit to wit that God was in Christ so in order for there a Ministry of reconciliation remember it's being reconciled to God so it must be God in the ministry reconciling his people unto himself is that right so it wasn't God reconciling people to Paul they weren't being reconciled to Cephas they weren't being reckoned reconciled to Apollo's but they were agents his Amen they were agents of God as Paul could say we are ambassadors be reconciled to God as we stand in Christ's stead so you could have someone who just loved Paul and they missed it it's not to be reconciled to Paul but through the ministry that is given that's revealed the real revelation breaking is where there comes a union between the vessel the individual and Christ oh my to wit that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself here was this like nature's coming together he was reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them I ask you a question in this country let's just look in this country do they come out and do they come out and get you and just say you're guilty of this crime in your going to prison for the rest of your life they don't do that there first of all there is an indicted there's an indicted and you wait you know in a holding cell or how you're out on bond or whatever more until there's a trial that comes about God answer if anybody think of this the Bible says that the law itself entered entered that sin might be exposed that was the purpose so where God could say this is guilty gone and pointed that out but notice when God came down reconciling the world unto himself he was not imputing their trespasses in them because here time where the payment is going to be made the actual time of judgment will come at the white throne judgment for those who neglected the Lord that will come because there has been a a price that's been paid for an individual for each and every one that you don't have to remain in that condition you can go free it's already the debt has already been paid so God and Christ were reconciled here together the Bible says in verse 21 of 2nd Corinthians 5 for he hath made him to be sin for us he made him to be there was a transfer of our sin upon him he was not only the light the the scapegoat he was the life goat he was that where our sins were placed upon him he was not sinful the Bible said he who knew no sin but it was transferred upon him hallelujah that we might be made the righteousness of God in him now as it moved back in here to colossians chapter 1 i'm trying to get somewhere here i want you to just follow me with this here and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him i say whether they be things in earth or things in heaven when he was offered up and the blood touched the ground there and he descended down into the lower parts of the earth he reconciled those who were waiting in paradise they had been they had they had come to a place where they were resting in the bosom of Abraham the promise awaiting the coming Sun awaiting the the promised land and here they were waiting and what does he come to do he comes to minister the word of reconciliation that my blood has been shed the price has been paid and then he makes this known to the disciples to those as he's with them appearing to them bringing their confidence within the word that they then themselves might walk in and be fully reconciled they were not reconciled just walking with him hope you're with me it's not enough just to walk around where he's at that's not reconciliation reconciliation is for him to bring you in him there's a stages of reconciliation it's God declaring his mind notice this here he couldn't die as God he couldn't die as God he had to become a man a spirit can't bleed spirit can't die but he had Almighty God God had to condon sin and take up on a robe of flesh and step in that there had to first of all and how did he do that he did it by his word little by little there were portions of word that were laid out all the way from the Garden of Eden and here himself bringing all the word together and he moves in steps right into that word he reconciled all the portions all the promises all the scriptures all the prophecies here a were reconciled right there concerning the Messiah hallelujah he was ordained to that and you say men he didn't have to do that it wasn't him reaching for straws and trying to make his place in the word this is what's his position lo I come in the volume of the book to do that which is written of me this was his place this was as a position and so when the spirit moving down it flows out naturally it's not something he had to make happen the light nature's had brought a union and now here God is flowing through that's always the key like nature's oh my someone someone someone had to be willing to pay the penalty think about that that's that's that's that's me it's tremendous somebody had to be willing to pay the penalty think of this here's Barabbas taken Barabbas don't have a good reputation if there's anyone that he might say huh he can extinguish him from society this guy's been a troublemakers whole time he's got a record down at the police station but he couldn't pay the penalty well who was gonna pay the penalty it's gotta be a guilty the guilty one has got to pay who is this tight in here in there thinking huh the guilty one has got to pay but who who could pay the guilty couldn't pay it had to be the innocent one pay the price when we get to looking at ourselves and our relationships and everything else I'll be the first to tell you I cannot stand to say I'm an innocent one but it causes us to search because within our hearts there's a desire to be reconciled Oh when there's a little something that's come between me and my wife oh brother when we've had some heated discussions oh you do you want me to act or what but there's something that moves I'm not putting myself as an angel there's times boy you want to take your I was right on this this is right that's right you're the head of the house let the wives be subject unto the husband and all things but watch how the word when it's being quoted to you watch what it does to your spirit what it does to your spirit will tell you the source of where it's coming and be careful that you don't reconcile you say well I'm reconciling with the word but watch what it's doing to your spirit because what it's doing to your spirit will tell you who it is behind the voice if thou be the Son of God is that right what was he trying to do the spirit was that Satan was trying to cover himself by the word and calls the Lord Jesus to be reconciled to his wants but how do what does the Prophet always say he said he didn't clown for the devil when we heed we he did that voice we're clowning I'll say Amen for everybody Lord I'm any man but you see how that was in it in order to pay the penalty somebody even if they're innocent one he who knew no sin became why why in order to reconcile he was not imputing your trust passes are my trust men say hey wait a moving with reconciliation Ellison did that mean that the Lord Jesus said you don't have to repent of anything you know nothing no no it but it was see it began in here see if the heart of God was not on display you could have never repented you understand what I'm saying but the heart of God here God empties himself out now that you might be drawn to him and say Lord Lord I come to you you're not coming in sir lord I don't know if I can I don't know if I can see his submission has drawn from you said Lord forgive me oh my you love him 1st Timothy chapter 2 verse 5 for there is one God and one mediator between God and men the man Christ Jesus God came down created that body and was able to stand in the gap for you and me was able through this to here hand here holy God here on the sinner this was the link to restore this link doesn't just restore you I'm just a sinner say back no no no no no this restores you back to the place where you were we're all things that were against you our struggles the Holy Spirit coming ministers that breach to you and I that the deed is clear you have the abstract the man Christ Jesus look at this who gave himself a ransom for all who gave himself see this wasn't forced he couldn't be forced to do that it couldn't be something you know saying you know what he had to be he had to give himself he had to willingly give himself for what for a ransom a ransom for all for all to be testified in due time my let me go on so here's a redeemer its redeemer becoming flesh God had not only wrote his Bible in the heavens he showed this all in the heavens but then God himself he showed the plan of redemption of reconciliation throughout all throughout the whole scriptures but God had spoke to the prophets he had revealed himself to Abraham he had made himself known to Moses all of these were portions of the word that were all pointing to him when he would come but yet none of them none of those within it were able to bring about the redemption and look think of this let me just make this statement here and work with this a moment the word itself is spoken what Moses saw when Moses remember when Moses saw he said he says let me see your face is that right let me see your face and here God comes down and he speaks he says no man could see my face and live but what Moses sees ask God puts him on the rock he says there's a place by me he puts him on the rock and he puts his hand over him and then now once he's passed by in that in that image that supernatural image here he passes by and here what he sees Moses sees the hind ER parts of a man but you see even though God had appeared in many forms he had appeared hid coming down with the orphan II he appeared in flesh but yet none of those comings were the comings of redemption they all pointed to it and so each one of these words the word expressing it was a vision being expressed but visions don't bleed you with me visions don't bleed but the vision has got to become manifest the word that was spoken all of those things that were spoken in type that word must become blood in order to fully reconcile the word had to become blood in the message masterpiece the Prophet says the perfect image the god man God in morphe had changed from Supernatural to the vision and the vision was projected into the image so you catch as he's bringing the whole condescension down he changed from the supernatural to the vision now the vision is projected into the image and the image was smitten so that the supernatural could taste the feeling of death God can't die but God needed to taste death God's perfect masterpiece he couldn't do it in Moses he couldn't do it in the prophets Isaiah who has solved the Saul's till he was solved two pieces he could not do it in the prophets they were stoned he could not do it because he couldn't feel it there was just a portion of him but in this perfect masterpiece he was the fullness of the Godhead bodily he could not only project Moses he could project his entire being into this person and taste death for the whole human race God's perfect masterpiece God so inspired by seeing it he become the Redeemer of all ages to speak for those in the backgrounds who have been before and now hold mine when the Lord Jesus arias is speaking as he's pardon me it's narrowing down the purpose of the love is coming it keeps on honing in it keeps on honing in as it gets closer and closer his purpose you see the more of his the maturing of the purpose was in his life to that place he is begin to see how things themselves begin to recede things begin to fall off the scripture talks about how that you know Bible says many of the disciples walked with him the more you begin to see as it's narrowing down to the purpose that things that was once around and hung on no longer are hanging on and listen to me that's the same way in our life not only has a bride body but it's the same way in our life individually of where we are in the body of Jesus Christ that as we are moving further on into that purpose of God then you fire that there are things that the Holy Spirit is pointing out but at the same time he's pointing out he is releasing to you the authority that is already in you to climb above those things why it's a honing in on the purpose we're not down here at the width of it we're at the narrowing of it and the narrowing of it there's a greater focus there's a greater sharpening there's a grate it's not it's it's honed in its zeroed in on the target you find the Lord Jesus look at this friends this was not just this was not a man who was just all he was so poised and he was so focused in pilots Hall and when they pulled beard out of his faith no no this is greater than that he was so locked in and it was so moved in his heart of what the purpose of God was to wear listen he had been revealed he knew his purpose all along but he became more one with that purpose and that purpose being expressed in his life brother Sam how can you say that because even when he himself is pray my soul is troubled keep me from this hour but yet for this hour came I into the world see it's honing in this is where the Lord Jesus could say in this time in John 12 now is the judgment verse 31 now is the judgment of this world now shall the Prince of this world be cast out and I if I be lifted up from the earth will draw all men unto me if I be lifted up he couldn't die on the earth he couldn't die in the heaven he had to die in the expanse in between and that's where he comes to receive you and I in the rapture it's in the expanse he has made a way that he might bring his body back to himself hallelujah he is that bridge hallelujah the heavens were opened glory be to God hallelujah I will draw a minute to me this word draw means to draw to impel inwardly draw in life in that vessel unto himself I don't know if this life's been drawn because it lives the same life he left a sacrificial life a life lived by the word and it's not you doing it it's him doing it the whole secret the whole secret see the people even in that time what does this talk about the son of man must die what is this they were saying that but the whole presentation the whole presentation where the one of the the one of the great secrets is the presentation in his death just stay with them gonna hone in on this point here this was one of the great secrets was the presentation in his death what you think of this coming back to this thought visions don't bleed but the vision must become flesh the word must become black when Abraham went up there to the mountain he was walking up with his promised son and he gets up to the mountain and he's told take your only begotten Son and offer him on the Mount that I will show thee God directs into this place Abraham walks in complete obedience once you think of this these things that we have heard for so many times but how did the profit zeroes right in on this and he says about that time when Abraham was getting ready had the knife in the air and was getting ready to take Isaac's life he said the Lord said stay your hand and he said immediately he's so ram caught in a thicket and the Prophet emphasizes it over and over he said how could a ram be up there in that mountain with the jackals and every other predator that could have taken that Ram but it was caught by its horns its strength God so became one of us he got caught and humanity the religious jackals the religious jackals tried to take him they took counsel together to try to kill him but they couldn't take him he was under the foreknowledge and counsel of God reserved for being provided offering for you and I the whole secret is in the presentation of his death his death was not a forced event but here he escapes many times but now he comes into a place he's submissive in death it's a stage of reconciliation where did where did this begin what we see on Calvary where what we see on Calvary is only a manifestation of a victory that was already hallelujah it was only a manifestation of a decision that had already been made it wasn't a decision that was lightly made if it's possible let this cup pass from me there wasn't that he didn't love you and I listen to me it was his love that kept him there and submitting himself in prayer that was the love of God listen to me that was the love of God that was God himself moving in the promise of the word to equip his son for the fulfillment the love of God how is the word fulfilled by the love of God glory be to God Philippians 2:7 look at these scriptures he made himself of no reputation took upon him the form of a servant Almighty God come down and become in the form of a servant he took upon himself the form of a servant this is all humility that started in now being displayed and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man listen to this he humbled himself there was a war going on Hebrews 5/7 he was heard in that he feared was strong tears and crying the Prophet brings a likeness he said he was contending with himself who do you contend with who do I contend with so I brother brems says when you even get a thought to think I got a right he said the Holy Spirit the dove just takes its flight who are we contending with it's our will vs. God's will but I got news for you today greater is He that is in you if you're born of the Spirit of God you have within you the authority to rise as a son to rise as a daughter how do I rise the way up is down down so when the word goes forth the word strikes here see God is doing moving in our life the same way he himself has moved down he starts in here and comes out and being found in fashion as a man can I have just a few more moments let me just come to this point and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself look at this and became obedient unto death remember the secret is in the presentation of the death he became obedient unto death even the death of the cross every moment in his life think of it when even they pressured him about going the last rest tomb and good this time the one whom thou lovest he was a lot of pressures that came his way there were pressures from his brethren John seven to declare himself out openly nobody has a gift like this and won't declare it openly he's getting pressure all around he's being pulled every which way and he's also bearing all these reproaches where people say he's nothing but you know this this mockery upon his laying all these things listen to this listen listen all those things were only items to try to divert him from the purpose let me tell you friends all of these things if we can really step back and zero in there are things that come our way that only try to divert us from the purpose I want to be very clear on this I'm not talking about putting your hands over your eyes and pretending and ignoring that's not what God did but what I'm saying is is that it starts here where in here there starts a desire to do what becoming a light nature become analyte nature that's the stages of reconciliation he became obedient unto death where was this happen where did this happen at Oh bill sent me oh this is happening pilots halt no no what gave him the strength to stand in pilot saw was what took place in that garden that is where the lamb prevailed that is where the lamb over came that is where the lamb took the book was where surrendering not my will that will be done he's becoming obedient unto death the innocent there's a transfer that's being made because it's it's a reconciliation here he is overcoming in the garden there was a fall in the Garden of Eden and here he comes in the Garden of Gethsemane there was a fall in that garden there's an overcoming in this garden garden is figurative of bride it's a special designated spot in which the king might come and find his rest and he overcame in Gethsemane and Gethsemane is the squeezing the Olive Press what's being squeezed out it's the last parts of his will the last parts of his will is being squeezed out that the purpose might be fulfilled you remember what I read to you on Thursday night when brother Bram talked about the incident within his own life when his when his wife was taken in his and his daughter remember what brother had said he said it was too much Branham and me and God had to squeeze out all of that that's the same with you and I he said God had to squeeze out too much Branham he thinks because the purpose of God had to be fulfilled it's too much and you and me and God keeps squeezing keep squeezing what's he doing he's bringing us to a place for our will to be so completely completely submitted to him that's what Abraham pro-trade in Genesis 22 I must stay off of the Hackman obedient unto death he overcome their brother Bram says it like this hiding himself in simplicity now he hid himself in the death of Christ but manifested himself in the resurrection he hid himself in the death of Christ Satan did Noah was the one look at this Satan not here I took Abel I took this one I took this one I stone this one I took this one but now here comes one and remember the prophet dramatizing it he said how Satan is watching him carry this cross and the blood spots are growing they're merging to one big spot he said in Satanist and they're saying this can't be the Son of God this can't be the Son of God the Son of God wouldn't take this but the Prophet comes back around he said but sons of God will put up as long as they know they are doing the will of God how could he do it because it was revealed to him his purpose and he had so surrender to the purpose that nothing else mattered nothing else mattered that's the same way it is in our lives it's yet to be that place that nothing else matters [Applause] we'll save you time put my hands on I'm not talking about that I'm talking about where it says nothing else matters this cannot remain if it's divisions and you don't listen to me divisions in your home divisions among you hear what much to do you must listen to me listen to me it must begin in here in here it's not something and say ok oh here here we'll do this and do this and oh honey I'm sorry you know oh just so ignorant I'm just so this or that you begin here here it's got to be condescending here did he just go to Calvary and yet were dead in our sins no it was a real real condescension it was real it's a stage of reconciliation I said I'm closing and I have on narrowing it down I'm zeroing in can we move and go back to Isaiah 53 and look at a couple verses of Scripture here Isaiah 53 and I'm gonna close on this we'll pick it up next time watch this in Isaiah 53 verse 10 yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him he hath put him to grief he willingly submitted when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days you're the manifestation of those days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand look at verse 11 all the rest of them are gathered around there and they're watching if they'll be the Son of God come down off the cross come to this all of this but there was a greater audience beholding one who was there that was tasting the feeling of death and he shall see the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied what was it it was revealing what was in him revealing what was in him by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities therefore will I divide him a portion with the Great and he shall divide the spoil with the strong he said how the same I know he bore our iniquities but how am I supposed to bear iniquities how am I supposed to do this oh he bore iniquities but then he came and he speaks to us what does he make known to us what does he do to you and I how what is this Ministry of reconciliation is to make known to you and I the debt has already been settled and it calls us to repentance to recognize he has already Borum away and even listen to me even when we are within our families when we are among in our church among among among different one maybe in your work placing your families their outs all of these things is it how do I it's not you bearing it but it's you bringing that very part of and saying Lord this is my desire I don't want this to be here so how do you how do we move through that remember how did he bring us to reconciliation not by imputing our trespasses but he came to pay the debt and sometimes in the paying of the debt is simply the coming in a humility and said hey you know what can we talk can we can we talk yeah you know there's some things here that I I want to resolve that right there is bearing what does it what is moving in reconciliation its stages its stages where does it start not with the physical action it starts here that's why it always starts with in a same Lord set my heart right if my feelings are not right Lord in listen it doesn't do any good it doesn't do any good if my feelings are not right it doesn't do any good in my family the church look I'm a human but this is one thing that I do by God's grace and I'm more even more acutely aware of it and that is the feelings Lord I don't want things in my heart I mean that I don't want things in my heart if there's something there that's hidden bring it to light Lord why would that be because that's his desire moving upon what he placed in my heart to be reside reconciled fully because from this reconciling of my soul it'll lead to the reconciling of the rest of this Tabernacle he shall see he shall see you see what you might look at a situation sometimes in your home and you might think how in the world how you might look at how in the world Oh somehow look at this look at this pattern where does it begin here when Lord shall see the travail when God sees that desire stirred up Lord more than anything Lord you watch God move you watch God move God moves by his word or Jesus father throughout our time and our gathering here this morning Lord Jesus you're the only one who can really really really truly bring your word to a place in our lives and our hearts Lord Lord to it it finds its place and it drops there Lord I pray this morning as I and Lord offer prayer for each and everyone myself included Lord or Jesus if we miss this stage of reconciliation that it's through death it comes with the cost we could not die to pay the penalty but because you were willing to die then you who are the greater you lead us to a place of dying to ourselves to where we might die that old nature that old man might die and that hidden man that's been there down beneath the darkness might be brought to light Lord we recognize as we see here this morning reconciling it comes with a price blood had to be shed and it can only be by the sacrifice of life you sacrificed your life being as you spoke to us if any man will deny himself let him take up his cross and follow me daily If any man love a father mother brothers sister more than me he's not worthy to be my disciple a word calling for reconciliation Lord within our hearts this morning I pray God if there's one that's here that doesn't know you they didn't they've never surrendered their life to you but yet they
