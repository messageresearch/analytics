[34:01] awesome God.
[34:04] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[34:08] [Music]
[34:09] Amen. Amen.
[34:16] It's quite overwhelming when
[34:18] you, you know, you step back and you
[34:21] look at God's grace over our lives.
[34:23] Amen. and how that before that even we
[34:26] were really fully
[34:28] aware, God was always aware. Amen. He
[34:32] always knew right where we
[34:34] were and coming clear from the mind of
[34:37] God. You know, these are things that's
[34:39] just beyond what our mind is able to
[34:42] comprehend. But I'm glad it's not based
[34:44] on what our minds can comprehend.
[34:47] There's a part by the God's grace that's
[34:50] given to us to be able to believe
[34:52] that. And that's the confidence that we
[34:54] have. You know, that's the that's the
[34:57] great thing with seeing that in the
[34:59] scripture of God's predestinated
[35:02] plan. It takes away all uncertainty.
[35:06] When we can see that God's plan is
[35:08] certain, everything that's taking place
[35:11] even right now, Brother Brand would make
[35:13] this statement over and over. He says,
[35:15] "Has God lost
[35:17] control?" No. He said God's permitting
[35:21] all of these agencies to work and
[35:25] everything is working right according to
[35:28] God's divine plan.
[35:31] To me that's the greatest thing we can
[35:33] do is get into the plan of God which is
[35:36] his word which is Christ.
[35:39] You know that's why I love the statement
[35:41] that the brother Brown had made to
[35:43] brother Brandham there in Shreport when
[35:46] brother Brandham was ministering in
[35:47] those closing services in ' 65. He said
[35:51] brother Brandham he said if people could
[35:53] only see what it is that you're trying
[35:55] to say and get in it. He said every
[35:59] problem would be done away with. It
[36:02] doesn't mean there wouldn't be problems.
[36:04] It's just you've got a confidence that
[36:06] he'll see me through. Amen. Amen. Don't
[36:08] you love him this morning? Amen. It's so
[36:11] good to be together. Amen. In his
[36:13] presence. And so we so appreciate that.
[36:15] Want to remind you, Lord willing, this
[36:18] this um evening here at 5:30, we're
[36:21] going to have a fireside fellowship. And
[36:24] we brother Shane had already checked it
[36:26] out. And so we're thankful for that and
[36:28] to be able to have that. And
[36:31] um man, this weather temperature going
[36:34] back and forth is something else, ain't
[36:35] it?
[36:37] Um, this morning I was sitting on the
[36:40] I'd been up since early. I was sitting
[36:42] on the couch with a blanket fireplace
[36:44] on. My wife comes out and she I said,
[36:47] "Honey, did you just turn the air
[36:48] conditioner on?" She said, "Yeah." I
[36:49] said, "I've got the fireplace on." I
[36:51] said, "It was 41° early this
[36:54] morning." But, um, I'm thankful one day
[36:58] this this earth's going to be lined back
[37:00] up.
[37:02] Amen. And I'm I'm glad we're going to a
[37:04] place we don't have to worry about
[37:06] furnaces and air conditions. I you know,
[37:08] we won't have to worry about PA
[37:09] equipment or nothing, you know. Amen.
[37:11] We're what a what a what a place we're
[37:13] looking forward to. And just want to say
[37:15] we're so thankful to have um Brother
[37:17] Jerry and Sister Mina and uh Michael and
[37:20] and Teddy. How'd you get that boy away
[37:23] from his mama and daddy?
[37:27] But it's good to have them here with us.
[37:29] And um so we're just so good to have
[37:32] each and every one. Good to have the
[37:34] Beamits back. I know they
[37:36] were in a nice sunny state of Florida.
[37:39] It was a brother Aaron. They had to plan
[37:42] that for his um his parents. And so at
[37:45] least that was the excuse he gave me.
[37:47] But um but we're just we're thankful to
[37:50] have them back. Thankful to have each
[37:51] and every one of you. I know different
[37:52] ones we've got as things come up. But
[37:54] it's always good to be together, isn't
[37:56] it? To me, it's always good to see one
[37:58] another and just just be together in
[38:00] service. Amen. So, um we want to um just
[38:05] take here just a few moments um of time
[38:08] here this morning. I'm going to ask my
[38:09] mom if she'll go ahead and come forward.
[38:12] And uh so this wasn't uh she didn't know
[38:16] anything about this or else she'd have
[38:17] been planning it.
[38:18] [Laughter]
[38:26] So, I I want to um That's okay. You want
[38:29] to come on up here?
[38:33] She does that to me. Yes.
[38:36] Oh goodness.
[38:38] So, we I wanted to um we wanted to give
[38:42] her just a a token and and it is her
[38:45] birthday coming up and I know every one
[38:46] of you have things to say about uh you
[38:49] your mom and that would be very fitting
[38:51] and I'm not really doing it so much
[38:53] about the birthday here but just to look
[38:56] for an opportunity. We had uh been able
[38:58] to recognize different ones that's been
[39:00] among us for all these years and has
[39:03] labored and um just a little something
[39:06] that um truly words itself could never
[39:09] really repay the the gratitude um for
[39:13] all the sacrifices and I say this on
[39:15] behalf of um myself and the church for
[39:17] all the years for um for believer spoken
[39:20] word tabernacle um from the secret from
[39:24] the secretarial labors uh that she's
[39:26] done and she did a lot of that behind
[39:28] the scenes and musical talents and uh
[39:31] remember when she had to matter of fact
[39:33] she took um lessons and she could
[39:36] already play but she brushed up a lot of
[39:39] things and I remember um in order to be
[39:42] able to play uh for us when the church
[39:45] was just starting in the YMCA and and
[39:48] then um you know over on Gary Avenue and
[39:51] the reason I remember had she brushed up
[39:52] on piano lessons cuz I had to sit in the
[39:55] back of the car in
[39:56] Lima for for a long time. But I'm but
[40:00] what I'm thankful for to me that was
[40:01] very minimal compared to the sacrifice
[40:03] that what she had to make. And we're
[40:05] thankful for that. Uh because uh brother
[40:08] Bill remembers how it was at times on
[40:09] the third on the Wednesday night
[40:11] services he had nobody. And it was it
[40:14] was truly ac cappella. And so uh we so
[40:17] appreciate that. And the and also you
[40:20] know the hearty amens. Uh she's always
[40:22] been one to really get in the services.
[40:24] It's just how mom's natured and but also
[40:26] the sleepless nights of prayer and uh
[40:29] perhaps you know most of all being a
[40:31] faithful companion to um to my dad and
[40:34] pastor James Browning from the beginning
[40:36] until this very day. We were looking at
[40:38] it and my wife and I were talking about
[40:40] it. mom um you know well you'll know
[40:43] sooner or later her birthday coming up
[40:45] this week and it's a great milestone but
[40:47] she was 37 years old when they started
[40:49] pastoring and uh and I say when they
[40:52] because you know brother Bam tells us
[40:54] God calls when he calls the man he calls
[40:55] his wife and it's the truth as well
[40:59] because they're that that burden to be
[41:00] there and we just so appreciate that and
[41:02] she stood right there beside him and
[41:05] from the seen and unseen contributions a
[41:07] lot of things we saw and we didn't see
[41:09] and everything that's been made. But I
[41:10] want to say on behalf of all of us, we
[41:12] are eternally grateful. Amen. And we
[41:15] love you. Amen. So appreciate you.
[41:20] Amen.
[41:23] Amen. Amen. So, it's actually been a
[41:26] blessing to to meet everybody and to be
[41:29] part of it and to watch it from the
[41:31] beginning and to where it's gone now.
[41:33] And then when brother Browning stepped
[41:35] down and turned it over to brother
[41:37] Samuel and sister Kim and all stepped
[41:39] in, we just thank all of you and it's
[41:41] been a real beautiful journey. I thank
[41:43] you for it. Love all of you. God bless
[41:45] you. Amen. God bless
[41:46] [Applause]
[41:59] you. She'll send me texts. She always I
[42:01] always get a text from mom before
[42:03] service mid mid midday on Thursday. I'm
[42:06] praying for you and I am looking forward
[42:09] with expectation. And then I'll get that
[42:11] on Sunday mornings and and then on you
[42:13] know after the service she'll tell me oh
[42:15] what a wonderful service. Now sometimes
[42:16] I think she's stretching the truth
[42:18] because I'll tell her I felt like many
[42:20] times I feel like scrambled
[42:21] eggs but she's always been you know
[42:24] encouraging in that way as well. And so,
[42:27] um, I just want to say we just so
[42:29] appreciate all that she's done. And then
[42:31] this coming week, she turns 80 years
[42:33] old.
[42:35] I pray if God carries Yep. I pray that
[42:38] I'm that spry. Yep. And able to move
[42:41] around at 80 years old.
[42:44] Amen. That's that that that would be my
[42:46] prayer. But I'm I'm looking forward to
[42:48] the rapture. How about you? I said,
[42:50] Lord, I I'm looking forward to that.
[42:52] Amen.
[42:53] So, we're just going to just get ready
[42:55] to welcome Brother Jerry. And I hope
[42:57] hope that was all right. I just thought
[42:58] that, you know, there's so many
[42:59] different ones that's been real pillars
[43:01] through the years for us here. And I
[43:03] think it's just so fitting uh to to
[43:06] recognize that. And so, we just so
[43:08] appreciate that. We appreciate every
[43:10] every one of you. I mean that every one
[43:12] of us have a part in what God is doing.
[43:15] And so, we just so we so appreciate
[43:17] Amen. the Lord so much.
[43:20] So, are you ready?
[43:23] Okay. So, I mean, glad to have brother
[43:25] Jerry here with us.
[43:33] God bless you. It's good to be here with
[43:35] you this morning.
[43:38] Um, first, let me say this. I, uh, I
[43:42] went through several years, you know,
[43:44] you knew from my testimony with
[43:46] suffering from mental illness. Uh during
[43:49] those times I didn't sing and uh I was
[43:53] having trouble with my hands so I really
[43:55] couldn't play the guitar back then but
[43:57] my hands are getting better and God's
[43:59] completely healed me of the mental
[44:01] illness and uh I know I gave my
[44:04] testimony here a little over a year ago
[44:07] and that but uh his healing power just
[44:10] kept working in me and uh I've uh I've
[44:14] been restored completely.
[44:20] So, I'm so thankful for that. I'll tell
[44:23] you,
[44:24] if you ever been bound by something, you
[44:27] know what it's like when you get freed.
[44:29] Yes, sir. And I've just been rejoicing
[44:32] because God has just set me so free from
[44:34] all that, you know. And uh it was uh
[44:38] demons tormented you you know and uh
[44:42] people say well demons can torment
[44:45] somebody that's filled with the Holy
[44:46] Ghost. Brother Ram actually said that.
[44:48] He said that a manuh he said could be
[44:51] born again. And he said demons torment
[44:55] him and put him out of his mind. He said
[44:58] but it has nothing to do with his soul.
[45:00] His soul is still uh redeemed. His soul
[45:03] is still filled with the Holy Ghost. And
[45:06] but I I believe we got a we serve a
[45:09] risen savior with a power today that can
[45:12] deliver us and heal us from all the
[45:16] sicknesses that that Satan can send our
[45:19] way. And I'm so thankful for that. Uh so
[45:23] you just prayed. I haven't played in a
[45:24] long time. So I've been practicing a
[45:26] little bit. But uh there's a couple of
[45:29] songs I want to sing today. I'll perhaps
[45:31] sing one now before I preach and then
[45:33] one afterwards.
[45:35] Uh so you just uh bear with me and uh
[45:38] but this song uh these are a couple of
[45:41] songs that my son Nathaniel introduced
[45:43] to the group back home and uh this
[45:46] particular song means so much uh because
[45:50] to me it speaks of you know you go
[45:53] through hard times sometimes you go
[45:55] through hard trials and battles and
[45:58] things you know but uh and like Jesus
[46:02] said there's times when people speak ill
[46:04] love you and tell lies on you and
[46:06] everything else. But he says when
[46:07] they're doing that, rejoice in that day.
[46:10] And so I wanted to sing this song uh for
[46:16] you. Lord, I thank you for sunshine. I
[46:20] thank you for rain. I thank you for joy
[46:23] and I thank you for pain. It's a
[46:26] beautiful
[46:29] day. It's a beautiful day.
[46:36] Lord, I thank you for sunshine. I thank
[46:39] you for rain. I thank you for joy and I
[46:42] thank you for pain. It's a beautiful
[46:47] day. It's a beautiful
[46:51] day. It's a beautiful day.
[46:57] Sometimes when life is
[46:59] [Music]
[47:01] good, but troubles come my
[47:05] way. Whenever it happens, Lord, I thank
[47:10] you for this day. And when I'm feeling
[47:18] troubled, I lift up my hands and pray
[47:22] that your will be done in the rain or
[47:25] sun.
[47:27] Oh, it's a beautiful
[47:30] day. Lord, I thank you for sunshine. I
[47:33] thank you for rain. I thank you for joy.
[47:37] I thank you for praying. It's a
[47:39] beautiful
[47:41] day. It's a beautiful
[47:45] day. It's a beautiful day. Lord, I thank

[49:02] [Applause]
[49:19] Amen. I'm a little rusty on the guitar.
[49:22] But
[49:23] uh you know it says make a joyful noise.
[49:26] I was happy while I was resting.
[49:29] So
[49:31] amen. Praise the Lord. It's it's good to
[49:33] be here in the house of the Lord with
[49:35] you again. And and I just thinking as my
[49:38] brother was recognizing my mom, he
[49:41] mentioned she was 37 when uh started the
[49:45] the church here pastoring and that and I
[49:48] was uh I was 19.
[49:52] And uh I I was 19 that that was it was
[49:56] actually
[49:58] uh the Sunday previous to Labor Day. Uh
[50:03] 1982 was the very first service that we
[50:07] had and it was over at the family Y and
[50:11] uh we uh had the first service there and
[50:14] we had to we had to pull the curtains.
[50:17] the room, the one whole wall was just
[50:19] nothing but glass. And we had to pull
[50:22] the curtains because there was people
[50:25] going swimming in the pool while we were
[50:27] having service and they were walking by
[50:29] in their bathing suits, you know, and so
[50:30] we had to pull the curtain and that. And
[50:33] uh I I remember that first service very
[50:36] much. And I I remember many that were
[50:38] there. I I remember you, Sister
[50:40] Stephanie. You Sister Stephanie showed
[50:41] up first service in a sundress. And and
[50:45] so I I I remember that. And uh Amen. and
[50:49] Sister Rita and and I I remember Sister
[50:51] Joe and brother Herb and and and
[50:54] different ones, you know, that that were
[50:56] there. And uh the ones that that started
[50:59] to come in and uh you know, we uh uh I
[51:04] was just a boy. I was just a kid. I was
[51:06] just 19. And uh you know I uh uh mom and
[51:11] dad they lived uh down around Salina,
[51:14] Ohio and were traveling up every weekend
[51:18] you know and uh so I uh I started going
[51:22] over to these sisters that come I
[51:24] started taking my wife me and sister
[51:26] mean we go over to their house to visit
[51:28] them and meet their husbands and uh and
[51:31] so I just found out whatever their
[51:34] husbands was what their interest was uh
[51:36] uh you
[51:38] if it was pitbulls or whatever it was, I
[51:41] that's what I talked about, you know,
[51:43] and uh I never talked about, hey, you
[51:46] you're a sinner. You need to get saved.
[51:48] You need to come to church. I just went
[51:50] over and just was a reflection of the
[51:52] life as best I could. And you know, it
[51:56] it it you know, the Bible said we're to
[51:58] be salty. Our lives be salty. Not not
[52:00] what you say necessarily, but you're let
[52:03] your life be salty. And I'll tell you
[52:05] what, if there's anybody out there
[52:06] thirsting after Jesus and you've got
[52:09] Jesus, you know, there is a path to
[52:11] life. And so, uh, you know, it just I
[52:15] remember that of really fond memories,
[52:18] you know, and I was 19, you know, I'm 62
[52:21] years old now. And so, uh, you know, I
[52:24] know some of you that's older than me,
[52:26] you probably look at me and say, "Well,
[52:27] you're not that old." Well, I tell you
[52:29] what, I feel old. And, uh, and I feel
[52:32] old every Every night when I climb into
[52:36] bed and and I I climb into bed and I
[52:39] moan and groan because I I feel pain
[52:42] from the relief of the pressure of
[52:44] standing on my legs and uh you know and
[52:47] then when I go to get up I moan and
[52:49] groan because I'm feeling the pressure
[52:50] coming back on them old legs and and you
[52:53] know you you ache and everything else
[52:56] and and it takes you forever to recover
[52:59] you know of anything you try to do you
[53:01] know and uh if you do some kind of labor
[53:04] outside working on your roof or
[53:06] something like that. Well, you feel like
[53:08] you got run over by a truck and uh you
[53:11] know and I just uh so a lot of years has
[53:15] went past a lot of waters went under the
[53:18] bridge. Amen. But I'll tell you this
[53:21] friends, you know, I feel like that on
[53:24] the outside, but I don't feel like that
[53:26] on the inside. On the inside, I feel
[53:29] young, you know, and when I look in the
[53:32] mirror, you know, I see a stranger
[53:34] because in my mind, I don't look like
[53:36] this. In my mind, I look like I looked
[53:38] when we started this church. And and I
[53:42] had hair back then, by the way. And uh
[53:45] so, uh you know, so and one day, you
[53:49] know what? One day, uh this outside body
[53:52] is going to match that again. Amen.
[53:56] We're going back. Amen. Hallelujah.
[53:58] Let's pray and then we'll we'll stand
[54:00] and read the scripture. Heavenly Father,
[54:02] we thank you to be here this morning,
[54:04] dear God. And we ask, God, you to guide
[54:06] us now through your word, dear God, in
[54:08] this message you've laid in our heart,
[54:10] dear Lord. And we ask that you would
[54:13] receive all glory and honor in Jesus
[54:15] Christ's name.
[54:17] Amen. I want to read my text from John
[54:20] chapter 3:es 1-8.
[54:23] And uh
[54:25] uh what what I want to title this this
[54:28] morning is you must be
[54:30] converted. Now many times we say you
[54:33] must be born again, but I want to go
[54:35] into a little more depth on what that
[54:37] means. And so I entitled it you must be
[54:41] converted. Amen.
[54:43] Uh there was a man of the Pharisees
[54:46] named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.
[54:49] The same came to Jesus by night and said
[54:51] unto him, "Rabbi, we know thou art a
[54:53] teacher come from God. For no man can do
[54:55] these miracles that thou doest, except
[54:58] God be with him." Jesus answered and
[55:00] said unto him, "Verily, verily, I say
[55:02] unto you, except a man be born again, he
[55:05] cannot see the kingdom of God."
[55:07] Nicodemus said unto him, "How can a man
[55:09] be born when he's old, can he enter the
[55:11] second time into his mother's womb and
[55:13] be born?" Jesus answered, "Verily,
[55:15] verily, I say unto you, except a man be
[55:17] born of water and of the spirit, he
[55:20] cannot enter into the kingdom of God.
[55:22] That which is born of the flesh is
[55:24] flesh. That which is born of the spirit
[55:26] is spirit. Marvel not that I say to
[55:28] thee, you must be born again. The wind
[55:31] bloweth where it listen, and thou hears
[55:33] the sound thereof, but canth tell whence
[55:36] it cometh, and whether it goeth. So is
[55:38] everyone that is born of the spirit."
[55:41] Amen. You may be seated.
[55:44] There's another scripture I would like
[55:46] you I'd like to read to you as you're se
[55:48] being seated. It's Luke chap
[55:55] 22. And we're going to read verses
[56:00] 31-34. And the Lord said, Simon, Simon,
[56:03] behold, Satan had desired to have you
[56:07] that he might sift you as wheat. But I
[56:10] have prayed for thee that thy faith fell
[56:12] not. And when thou art converted, and
[56:15] that word there, converted, you look it
[56:17] up in the the Greek, it means turned
[56:21] about strengthen when when thou art
[56:24] converted, strengthen thy brethren. And
[56:26] he said unto him, Lord, I'm ready to go
[56:29] with thee both into the prison and to
[56:31] death. Peter was very honest and sincere
[56:34] here. This is exactly what Peter's
[56:37] thought was. Peter wasn't, you know,
[56:39] telling a fib or something. This is
[56:42] Peter believed what he was saying. Yeah.
[56:45] He was very sincere about
[56:47] it. And he said, "I tell thee, Peter,
[56:50] the shall crow this day before thou
[56:54] shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me."
[56:57] Amen.
[56:59] Now he he says that Peter he says you
[57:04] when you are converted now you you
[57:07] realize that uh Peter he had been called
[57:12] friends he he he had been called by
[57:14] Jesus he'd been drawn by the father
[57:16] Peter was saved you know Peter Peter was
[57:20] sanctified
[57:22] because Jesus remember Jesus I believe
[57:24] it's in Matthew 10 Peter says father I
[57:27] sanctif ify these that that you've
[57:30] called unto me through thy word. So he
[57:33] was sanctified. Peter was commissioned.
[57:36] Peter the gift of being uh of preaching
[57:40] was all had already been manifest and
[57:42] being used. Peter went out and preached
[57:45] in Jesus' name. Peter healed the sick in
[57:48] Jesus' name. Peter Peter uh uh uh cast
[57:52] out devils in Jesus' name. Peter raised
[57:55] the dead in Jesus's name. You know, uh
[57:59] all actually all of those remember he
[58:01] sent the 70 out and they were doing
[58:03] this. They were doing all of these
[58:05] works. Also remember in their midst
[58:08] among them also doing the same thing was
[58:11] Judas.
[58:13] That's good.
[58:17] He was doing all of these things, but
[58:20] then Jesus looks around him and said,
[58:22] "You're not even converted yet.
[58:30] He recognized and actually said that
[58:33] Peter had faith. He says, "I pray." He
[58:36] says that that uh uh thy faith fell not.
[58:41] Peter had faith.
[58:46] But Jesus said, "But when thou art
[58:48] converted, strengthen the brother."
[58:51] Now what does this word converted means?
[58:53] Brother Brandham says that word
[58:55] converted means to change
[59:00] to be changed. You know many times we
[59:02] use the word converted meaning somebody
[59:05] changes from one religion to the other.
[59:08] Preaching. Yeah.
[59:10] But but but this is more than just
[59:13] changing religions.
[59:15] This is not just uh turning over a new
[59:18] leaf. That's right. Amen. You know, many
[59:21] people, friends, what they do, they come
[59:23] to God and and actually their commitment
[59:26] isn't really any deeper than like a New
[59:29] Year's resolution.
[59:32] They they make a promise. I'm going to
[59:34] change. I'm going to do better. I'm
[59:36] going to quit doing these things that I
[59:38] know is wrong, and I'm I'm going to live
[59:40] better. And here's the thing. For for a
[59:43] time, they can actually pull it off.
[59:45] Brother Benham said, but brother Benham
[59:47] said that what they're doing is they're
[59:50] impersonating.
[59:53] Hallelujah. But there's nothing to hold
[59:56] them.
[1:00:03] Hallelujah.
[1:00:04] Brother Random said he was talking in
[1:00:07] the message of Israel in the church and
[1:00:08] he said talking about Billy Graham and
[1:00:10] some of them would go and preach in
[1:00:12] places and they would say you know we
[1:00:14] get 20,000 converts in two weeks. He
[1:00:17] says and then two weeks later would come
[1:00:20] back he says and we can't find 20
[1:00:23] and and brother Brandham said to them
[1:00:25] said well they wasn't converted
[1:00:28] and they said well they accepted Christ
[1:00:30] as their personal savior. Brother said
[1:00:33] they're still not converted. They're not
[1:00:35] converted until to convert means to
[1:00:38] change.
[1:00:41] And then he brings out in this message
[1:00:43] about Peter. Peter believed. He'd been
[1:00:45] baptized, been given power to heal the
[1:00:47] sick, cast out devils, raised the dead.
[1:00:50] He says, "But then the night before the
[1:00:52] crucifixion, Jesus told him, when you're
[1:00:55] converted, strengthen the brethren."
[1:00:57] right? Done all these things and wasn't
[1:01:01] born again. Now, when we use the term
[1:01:04] born again, you say, "Oh, yeah, I know.
[1:01:06] He hadn't received the Holy Ghost yet
[1:01:07] because they hadn't went uh, you know,
[1:01:10] to uh the upper room and been endued
[1:01:12] with the power from on high." So, so we
[1:01:14] know that. But make this connection here
[1:01:16] that Brother Brandham's making. He
[1:01:18] preached, he believed, he was baptized.
[1:01:22] Look friends, brother Rab said you can
[1:01:24] shout, you can dance, you can do all
[1:01:26] these things, speak in tongues. He says,
[1:01:29] but that's not your proof that you have
[1:01:32] been converted, born again, actually
[1:01:36] sealed by the Holy Ghost of promise.
[1:01:40] Hallelujah. That's right. Remember the
[1:01:43] 70 came back and they were actually
[1:01:45] shouting and rejoicing that the devils
[1:01:49] were subject to them. And Jesus said,
[1:01:52] "Don't rejoice cuz devils are subject to
[1:01:54] you." He said, "But rejoice because your
[1:01:57] names are written in heaven."
[1:02:01] Hallelujah.
[1:02:04] Hallelujah.
[1:02:05] Friends, look, you can get the a
[1:02:10] baptism, let me say it this way, of the
[1:02:12] Holy Ghost out on your spirit realm and
[1:02:15] on your flesh. That's what makes people
[1:02:17] look shouting and dancing. That's
[1:02:19] wonderful. Brother Graham says, "I
[1:02:21] believe in it, but it's not the
[1:02:23] evidence."
[1:02:26] I want you to realize something,
[1:02:28] friends. The baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:02:30] to the bride is the baptism without
[1:02:33] sensation.
[1:02:38] I'm not against sensation. I'm not
[1:02:40] against emotion. I'm an emotional
[1:02:42] person.
[1:02:44] I can't get happy without showing it.
[1:02:48] Right.
[1:02:50] That's good preaching. You know, some
[1:02:52] people get upset and they just get quiet
[1:02:55] and walk off and don't say anything.
[1:02:56] That's not me. I'm
[1:02:58] sorry. I'm an emotional person. I I I
[1:03:01] show it. So, I'm not against emotions,
[1:03:04] but the emotions are not your proof.
[1:03:07] That's right. Anybody can get emotional.
[1:03:10] That's right. Yeah. That's right.
[1:03:12] friends. I I've been in services where I
[1:03:14] have seen people that and I'm not
[1:03:17] talking about Pentecostal or
[1:03:19] organizations out here and all that. I'm
[1:03:21] talking about so-called message uh
[1:03:24] proclaimed churches. I've been in
[1:03:27] churches where they used music to get
[1:03:30] people riled up to dance. I danced with
[1:03:33] them.
[1:03:35] I was 15 years old out there dancing in
[1:03:39] the aisle. said, "Did you feel the
[1:03:42] presence and power of God?" I sure did.
[1:03:46] But I wasn't changed. That's right.
[1:03:49] That's good.
[1:03:51] I've seen them perform miracles
[1:03:56] and then turn around and walk away and
[1:03:58] leave this
[1:04:00] message. That's right. That's right.
[1:04:02] Walk completely away from even serving
[1:04:05] Jesus Christ.
[1:04:07] and yet perform miracles, friends, that
[1:04:09] I witnessed with my own eyes.
[1:04:14] I was in a service one time. They
[1:04:15] carried a man in on a stretcher.
[1:04:18] He couldn't even
[1:04:20] walk. He He had injured his back.
[1:04:23] Couldn't move. They carried him in on a
[1:04:25] stretcher, carried him up there in the
[1:04:26] front. The the the pastor came down and
[1:04:29] prayed for him, and off that God he came
[1:04:31] and ran around that church. I chased
[1:04:33] him.
[1:04:36] I was 15 years old.
[1:04:40] I've also saw the complete auditor side
[1:04:46] where they got people that try to use
[1:04:48] quotes and things from church order to
[1:04:50] completely squash all the motions.
[1:04:54] Don't dare say amen out loud. Wow. I
[1:04:57] remember we were attending a church like
[1:04:58] that once and and my dad got kind of
[1:05:01] happy during the service, you know, kind
[1:05:03] of rejoicing while the preacher was
[1:05:05] preaching and afterwards the deacon come
[1:05:07] up there and said, "I thought we was
[1:05:09] going to have to come down and set you
[1:05:10] down."
[1:05:12] Why?
[1:05:14] That's good.
[1:05:18] That's good.
[1:05:20] I was in a camp meeting one time. Me and
[1:05:23] my brother was sitting. We were sitting
[1:05:25] with my dad at this camp meeting and
[1:05:29] brother Biscll was preaching. All right.
[1:05:31] Now, the majority of the folks at this
[1:05:33] camp meeting, they was quiet folks. Some
[1:05:36] of them had come from this quiet church
[1:05:38] that I told you about. And and so they
[1:05:40] didn't believe in all this displaying
[1:05:42] stuff. And I'll tell you what, brother
[1:05:44] Bis got to preaching and I couldn't keep
[1:05:47] my seat. My brother couldn't keep his
[1:05:48] seat. We kept jumping up and amen and
[1:05:50] standing up and and amening him and
[1:05:52] things, you know, and all that, you
[1:05:54] know, and uh and people were just
[1:05:56] looking and looking and looking, you
[1:05:58] know, and and so another brother was
[1:06:01] from my church was visiting too. He
[1:06:02] said, he said, the deacon come up and
[1:06:04] said something to me. He said, "How come
[1:06:05] the deacon didn't come up and say
[1:06:06] something to you and your brother?" I
[1:06:07] said, "Cuz he saw my dad sitting there."
[1:06:11] Yes, sir.
[1:06:13] But you know what? Here they were just
[1:06:15] kind of sitting there like that and
[1:06:16] brother Bill Cook preaching. After a
[1:06:18] bit, brother William said, "What's the
[1:06:20] matter with you people? Every one of you
[1:06:21] should be on your feet."
[1:06:25] You can rejoice. I believe in rejoicing
[1:06:27] the word, friends. Yes, sir. But I'll
[1:06:29] tell you what, I've seen people rejoice.
[1:06:31] Devils can rejoice.
[1:06:35] That's not the evidence that you
[1:06:36] actually have been converted and filled,
[1:06:40] sealed with the Holy Ghost of promise.
[1:06:44] That's so good. Brother Brandham says it
[1:06:48] it has to be something
[1:06:52] supernatural that happens down inside
[1:06:55] your soul.
[1:06:57] It's a supernatural thing. Yes, sir. You
[1:07:00] know, you you know why people want to
[1:07:02] point to tongues or they want to point
[1:07:04] to, you know, I look, I have heard
[1:07:05] message preachers get up and say, "Boy,
[1:07:08] I tell you, I felt like rain falling
[1:07:10] down over me when I got the Holy Ghost."
[1:07:12] Maybe they did. I don't know. But that's
[1:07:15] not your evidence. I had another one get
[1:07:17] up and say, "Boy, I tell you what, a
[1:07:19] chill went all the way up my spine when
[1:07:21] I got the Holy Ghost."
[1:07:25] I was amazed sitting out there thinking,
[1:07:28] "And you believe this message and that's
[1:07:30] what you're telling these young people."
[1:07:32] It was at a young people's meeting.
[1:07:34] Yeah, brother. That might have happened,
[1:07:37] but that's not your evidence.
[1:07:39] That's right. That's good.
[1:07:43] Good. Hallelujah.
[1:07:46] The evidence says something changes down
[1:07:49] in here.
[1:07:51] Not just something not you just changing
[1:07:54] something on the outside. Look in in in
[1:07:56] in in in Ezekiel God said I'll give you
[1:08:01] a new spirit.
[1:08:04] Brother says many people come and they
[1:08:06] get that they come up they get saved.
[1:08:09] They get sanctified. He said, "And they
[1:08:11] and they get the new spirit and they
[1:08:13] think that's the Holy Spirit." He said,
[1:08:15] "That's not the Holy Spirit."
[1:08:18] He said, "That's just God giving you a
[1:08:20] new spirit." He said, "With your old
[1:08:23] spirit, you couldn't get along with your
[1:08:25] neighbor."
[1:08:26] He said, "Some of y'all couldn't even
[1:08:28] get along with yourselves
[1:08:31] with that old
[1:08:32] spirit." He said, "So, you sure couldn't
[1:08:34] get along with God or the Holy Spirit in
[1:08:37] you. God couldn't give you the Holy
[1:08:39] Spirit until he gave you a new spirit.
[1:08:41] The new spirit in your triune being.
[1:08:45] That's right. That's good. That's so
[1:08:47] good. And people get that and and they
[1:08:50] feel good.
[1:08:52] You know, and and they get, you know,
[1:08:54] what happens, friends? They come in and
[1:08:56] actually the this the the spirit of of
[1:09:00] the devil that's in them or on them, it
[1:09:03] leaves. The Bible says it leaves on its
[1:09:06] own. That's right. That's right. That's
[1:09:08] good preaching. That's right. Yes, sir.
[1:09:11] Yeah. And then here's this vessel. It's
[1:09:14] been called, justified. It's been
[1:09:16] sanctified, cleaned out. The unclean
[1:09:18] spirit has gone out of a man, right?
[1:09:23] But then the unclean spirit, the Bible
[1:09:25] says, it walks in dry places and finding
[1:09:28] no place to rest, says, "I'll return
[1:09:31] again to mine house." Amen. And it comes
[1:09:34] back and it finds this house, this body,
[1:09:37] finds it cleaned, scoured out, but it's
[1:09:41] still empty.
[1:09:43] The good man of the house hasn't moved
[1:09:46] in. Nobody has taken their abode there.
[1:09:49] That's good. That's so good. This person
[1:09:52] comes to church, friends. This look,
[1:09:55] read the message. Brother Bam talked
[1:09:57] about why people are so tossed about.
[1:09:59] Right. You see people up and down in
[1:10:02] they come into church and boy they get
[1:10:04] on fire and look they are sincere and
[1:10:07] they'll they'll say just like Peter
[1:10:09] said, "I'll go all the way with you."
[1:10:12] And they mean it in their heart. They
[1:10:14] believe they mean it.
[1:10:17] But the problem
[1:10:18] is that house stays empty. They don't
[1:10:22] have an anchor in their soul. They don't
[1:10:25] have nothing in there to hold them.
[1:10:28] [Music]
[1:10:31] That's so good.
[1:10:33] I was talking to somebody one time, you
[1:10:35] know, and and they were talking about an
[1:10:37] individual uh that they knew and they
[1:10:40] said it was one their son-in-law and
[1:10:43] they were saying, "Look what he done and
[1:10:45] all this and he went out and he he
[1:10:48] committed adultery. He had done all
[1:10:49] these other things and everything else."
[1:10:51] And I I said, "Well, he didn't have the
[1:10:53] Holy Ghost." Right? And and this person
[1:10:56] said to me, "Well, no, no, he had the
[1:10:57] Holy Ghost." Said, "But he lost it."
[1:11:01] See, their their whole thing was his
[1:11:03] proof to whether he had it. The
[1:11:05] supposedly spoke in tongues. Said, "But
[1:11:07] he lost it." And so, I didn't argue
[1:11:10] nothing. I just asked I said, "How about
[1:11:13] what is what about Ephesians 4:30 where
[1:11:16] it says, "Grieve not the Holy Spirit of
[1:11:18] God, whereby you've been sealed until
[1:11:20] the day of your religion or your
[1:11:23] redemption.
[1:11:25] sealed into the day of your redemption.
[1:11:29] That that caused the individual to kind
[1:11:30] of stop and really think and consider
[1:11:32] that they they were a Bible reader, you
[1:11:35] know,
[1:11:39] look friend, that this was somebody that
[1:11:43] that didn't really know this end time
[1:11:44] truth. But here, I'll give you something
[1:11:46] to shock you. There's people that say
[1:11:48] they believe this message and this end
[1:11:49] time truth that believe people can lose
[1:11:51] the Holy Ghost. Yeah,
[1:11:55] I've sat right in the home where where
[1:11:57] men accused their pastor of losing the
[1:12:00] Holy Ghost because he got a little upset
[1:12:03] at one of them talking in the back room
[1:12:05] with them.
[1:12:09] I I spoke up and I said, "Brothers, hold
[1:12:12] on. Hold on. You can't lose the Holy
[1:12:14] Ghost."
[1:12:17] I said, "It said you are sealed into the
[1:12:19] day of your dreams." You're sealed.
[1:12:22] Yes, sir. And they said, "Well, what
[1:12:23] about brother Bram saying about, you
[1:12:25] know, that that that nature and then and
[1:12:27] the dove will take its flight." I said,
[1:12:28] he was talking about the presence.
[1:12:31] That's totally different than the Holy
[1:12:33] Ghost. The pre God can pull his presence
[1:12:36] back from you to correct you, get your
[1:12:38] attention. But once you've been born
[1:12:40] again, once you've been converted, you
[1:12:43] are sealed.
[1:12:45] [Applause]
[1:12:47] Friends, listen. If it is, if you could
[1:12:50] lose it, then what confidence do we have
[1:12:54] that we'll even be able to make it?
[1:13:00] How could we say that it was the title
[1:13:02] deed? How could we say that it was the
[1:13:04] proof that we're going to have a body
[1:13:07] change if we could lose it?
[1:13:13] I can't believe message preachers, some
[1:13:15] of them preaching things like that. Wow.
[1:13:17] I'm not downing them, friends. I pray
[1:13:19] that God will open their eyes to it. Cuz
[1:13:22] I'll tell you this, friends. Look, if
[1:13:25] you're preaching wrong to your
[1:13:28] people and the people are feeding on
[1:13:30] something that's wrong, you know, you
[1:13:32] know what the what Brother Bam said? He
[1:13:34] said, "False teachers bring false
[1:13:37] births." He said, "False prophets bring
[1:13:40] false births." They bring a birth to the
[1:13:44] church.
[1:13:45] They bring a birth to something else.
[1:13:50] That's good.
[1:13:52] Listen, listen to the message brother
[1:13:54] Bam preached about path of life. Brother
[1:13:56] Bam goes into and he talks about here's
[1:13:58] that unic down there and he's reading
[1:14:00] the scripture. All right. And Philillip
[1:14:03] comes and sees him and Philip says
[1:14:05] understand what thou readest
[1:14:08] and the unic says how can I except some
[1:14:11] man guide me? Yeah,
[1:14:14] brother goes in that into a message
[1:14:16] called a
[1:14:17] guide. How can I except some man guide
[1:14:20] me? Brother said there is a path of
[1:14:24] life.
[1:14:26] Amen. Now, no man, no preacher can
[1:14:30] actually uh give you or make you born
[1:14:33] again.
[1:14:35] But it's the word of God that you're
[1:14:37] birthed by. And if that and if that word
[1:14:40] is coming through a vessel that hasn't
[1:14:43] been born again and birthed, then that
[1:14:46] vessel can't bring you to a birth.
[1:14:50] You cannot get birth through a through
[1:14:52] the the word coming through a preacher
[1:14:55] that ain't been born again.
[1:14:58] That's right. Amen. That's right. That's
[1:15:00] right. So good. My dad always taught me.
[1:15:04] He said, "Look, these these preachers,"
[1:15:06] he says that they they they've got wrong
[1:15:09] spirits on them. He says, "And they go
[1:15:12] out and they they they they commit
[1:15:14] adultery. They do all these things on
[1:15:15] the side in secret nobody knows about."
[1:15:18] He said, "Then they come in and preach
[1:15:19] to the people." He said, "When that word
[1:15:21] is going out from them, that spirit's
[1:15:23] going out from them, too." He said, "You
[1:15:26] watch that spirit show up on people in
[1:15:28] the church." Wow. That's right. That's
[1:15:31] right. Brother Random said, "Many times
[1:15:33] people take on that man's spirit rather
[1:15:35] than God's spirit."
[1:15:39] That's right.
[1:15:41] So good.
[1:15:43] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:15:48] The path of life. Friends, look, I'm
[1:15:49] going to tell you something. You've got
[1:15:51] to be sitting under a ministry in this
[1:15:54] end time that's actually born again.
[1:15:58] Amen. It don't matter how good they can
[1:16:01] preach. It doesn't matter how much it
[1:16:04] makes you happy and rejoice to hear them
[1:16:06] preach.
[1:16:09] We have witnessed and seen men around
[1:16:12] this message. Really great,
[1:16:16] tremendous preachers,
[1:16:18] good speakers,
[1:16:22] turn around and walk away from this
[1:16:24] message.
[1:16:27] Absolutely. Yeah. And then they they
[1:16:30] actually show their colors because they
[1:16:32] can't just walk away. They've got to put
[1:16:35] out videos or or or write stuff online
[1:16:39] and post things that's anti the message.
[1:16:44] Trying to expose it is wrong. Expose the
[1:16:47] prophet is wrong.
[1:16:53] [Music]
[1:16:54] And yet they were great, tremendous
[1:16:56] preachers.
[1:16:57] men would different churches would
[1:17:00] invite them in to preach special
[1:17:02] meetings and things like that and the
[1:17:04] churches would get backed out from
[1:17:05] people coming all around to come and
[1:17:07] hear him preach.
[1:17:15] People say, "Well, you a preacher could
[1:17:17] preach and not have the Holy Ghost."
[1:17:20] Gifts and callings are without
[1:17:21] repentance.
[1:17:24] Yes, sir. Let me give you a message
[1:17:27] title. False anointed ones at the end
[1:17:29] time.
[1:17:31] Hallelujah.
[1:17:34] Hallelujah.
[1:17:37] Oh, they're called. Now, there's been
[1:17:39] many out there we say, well, you know
[1:17:41] what? They weren't even
[1:17:45] called. My mom used to say, well, we
[1:17:48] came out and said there was many of
[1:17:49] them. She said that were what did it
[1:17:51] say? Mama called and papa sent and some
[1:17:54] just packed up their bags and went.
[1:18:00] That's good. That's good. But there
[1:18:04] there's many they actually born with
[1:18:06] that gift in their life.
[1:18:10] I'll tell you what friends, you take
[1:18:12] somebody that's born with a gift to
[1:18:13] preach in their life, they are the best
[1:18:15] salesman in the world. Yeah, buddy. You
[1:18:18] put them with a Kirby in their hand and
[1:18:21] they'll sell it to
[1:18:25] you. Put them on a car lot.
[1:18:29] Sold. Why? It's a gift that's
[1:18:34] there. Now, I'm not selling you
[1:18:36] anything. What I got's free. How can you
[1:18:39] help? How can you help but buy into
[1:18:41] that?
[1:18:43] All you got to do is accept it. Receive
[1:18:45] it. Friend, there ain't nothing you got
[1:18:47] to do.
[1:18:50] The Holy Ghost, being born again, being
[1:18:52] converted, it don't cost you nothing.
[1:18:55] It's without money and without price.
[1:18:57] It's a promise.
[1:19:00] [Applause]
[1:19:02] It is a gift to you. It's not something
[1:19:06] you got to earn.
[1:19:09] Now, of course, you got to come the way
[1:19:11] of the word to it.
[1:19:14] Repent.
[1:19:17] repent, be baptized,
[1:19:21] but see, many people do that and then
[1:19:23] they stop right there.
[1:19:26] And they come in and they're rejoicing
[1:19:28] in church with you. And friends, they
[1:19:30] they can be here for for months or they
[1:19:32] can be here for years or or whatever.
[1:19:34] Look, friends, I have sojourneyed with
[1:19:36] people in this message over the years
[1:19:38] I've been in it that sojourned them many
[1:19:40] years and next thing you know, they're
[1:19:43] gone. I like if anybody was going to be
[1:19:45] there and stay, they were. Now, sure,
[1:19:47] we've seen the fly by nights come. You
[1:19:49] know, they're in today and out tomorrow.
[1:19:54] You know, it grieves us when we we have
[1:19:56] people come in and we accept him in as
[1:19:58] our brother or our sister, you know, and
[1:20:00] and and and they're our friend, you
[1:20:03] know, and and and we feel like we're
[1:20:05] traveling together, you know, and then
[1:20:06] it grieves us. Not that that we feel
[1:20:08] like they done something against us, but
[1:20:10] it grieves us because we see they've
[1:20:13] walked away from something so awesome.
[1:20:18] And what did they give it up for?
[1:20:21] Nothing.
[1:20:24] That's amazing. Death.
[1:20:28] I have had people leave the church
[1:20:33] because they, you know, they didn't want
[1:20:36] to give a $100 a month for
[1:20:40] tithing. And I said,
[1:20:44] "Well, you
[1:20:47] know, Judas sold out for 30 pieces of
[1:20:50] silver."
[1:20:54] Some people sold out, brother Bam said,
[1:20:56] for a lot less.
[1:20:58] Some people sell out for things that
[1:20:59] ain't even money.
[1:21:06] Let me tell you something. Legalism,
[1:21:09] brother. Listen, Paul talks about
[1:21:11] legalism in Colossians the 2 chapter.
[1:21:15] Paul says this, "Taste not, do not,
[1:21:17] drink not, eat not." You know, that's
[1:21:20] not what this is.
[1:21:23] It's not a bunch of don'ts. That's
[1:21:25] right. Amen. That's right. I'll tell you
[1:21:28] what, a a legalistic religion.
[1:21:32] It It centers on telling you all the
[1:21:36] things you can't do. Yeah. As a law laid
[1:21:40] down as a law.
[1:21:43] That's good. So good.
[1:21:46] But the thing about it is people can do
[1:21:48] those things. And you say, "Well, are
[1:21:50] they wrong or right or what?" Look, like
[1:21:53] for instance, women don't cut your hair,
[1:21:55] wear long hair. They can do that. Wear
[1:21:58] long dresses. They do
[1:22:02] that. Men have your haircuts and
[1:22:05] different, you know, the different
[1:22:06] things we can lay out that that we
[1:22:08] realize. We say, "Well, this is message
[1:22:10] doctrine. This is message teaching. This
[1:22:12] is teaching doctrine of the Bible."
[1:22:15] And they can keep all those things. Many
[1:22:16] message people, they keep that. They
[1:22:19] come in to the message, you know, and
[1:22:22] they get sanctified and they just start
[1:22:24] keeping a set of laws.
[1:22:30] And that's what's preached to them.
[1:22:36] I went to a church years ago, friend.
[1:22:38] Every Sunday night, I had to go up to
[1:22:40] the altar and get saved. It's what I
[1:22:43] felt like.
[1:22:46] If you didn't come up to the altar,
[1:22:49] people in the church looked at what's
[1:22:50] wrong with you.
[1:22:54] This wasn't a Pentecostal church. This
[1:22:57] was a message church. I'm not throwing
[1:22:59] off on
[1:23:02] him. I used to feel so
[1:23:05] condemned. Say, "Were you making
[1:23:07] mistakes and all that?" Yeah, I was. And
[1:23:08] I can also tell you this. I wasn't born
[1:23:10] again and I didn't know it.
[1:23:18] Every Sunday night, I was up there
[1:23:19] weeping and crying, saying, "God,
[1:23:21] forgive me."
[1:23:24] Sure, if we make mistakes, we ask God to
[1:23:26] forgive us.
[1:23:29] But I'm going to tell you something,
[1:23:30] friends. You can live a victorious life
[1:23:33] in God.
[1:23:35] You're going to make mistakes. You're
[1:23:37] going to you're going to see. Here's the
[1:23:39] thing, friends. When you are born again
[1:23:42] converted, this old boy don't get
[1:23:44] converted.
[1:23:47] That's why the Bible says we can't come
[1:23:50] and meet the Lord in this body of flesh
[1:23:54] that we're living in.
[1:23:57] This flesh cannot inherit the kingdom.
[1:24:02] That's why we need a body change. We
[1:24:05] need a new body to match the new us on
[1:24:08] the inside.
[1:24:12] And when you are truly born
[1:24:15] again, sealed by the spirit of promise,
[1:24:18] that is your evidence that you're going
[1:24:20] to have that body change because this
[1:24:23] body has got to match what's happened on
[1:24:26] the inside.
[1:24:29] That is your evidence that one day
[1:24:31] you're going to step from this human
[1:24:33] spirit into a theophony. Amen.
[1:24:38] Amen.
[1:24:41] But in the same scripture that Paul
[1:24:44] covers that in in in second
[1:24:47] Corinthians, you go drop on down and
[1:24:50] then Paul goes into talking about those
[1:24:53] who don't get converted.
[1:24:56] And he said on the day of judgment,
[1:24:58] they'll stand there before God in the
[1:25:02] bodies that they sinned in. That's
[1:25:04] right.
[1:25:06] Yeah.
[1:25:10] But he said, "If this earthly tabernacle
[1:25:13] be dissolved, we've got a house waiting.
[1:25:16] A house not built with hands." Amen.
[1:25:18] Hallelujah. Prepared by God for us. A
[1:25:20] new body.
[1:25:23] Friends, look, this old body has done
[1:25:26] some really awful things. But this old
[1:25:29] body, I'm going to drop this thing. It's
[1:25:31] going to have it's going to have a
[1:25:33] jubilee molecular change.
[1:25:41] All these molecules has got out of sync,
[1:25:44] you know, out of orbit that causes me to
[1:25:46] get sick and be subject to the
[1:25:48] sicknesses and things of this world, all
[1:25:51] that's going to be brought back into the
[1:25:52] right correct orbit. Amen.
[1:25:56] Molecules are going to realign and my
[1:25:58] body's going to change and I'll never
[1:26:01] die. My body will never die.
[1:26:05] I've already been changed and can't die.
[1:26:07] Hallelujah.
[1:26:09] I just We just need to have a body
[1:26:11] that'll match that.
[1:26:14] Hallelujah.
[1:26:16] Praise the Lord.
[1:26:19] Brother says this in in the message of
[1:26:22] Israel in the church. He says not any
[1:26:25] fleshly demonstration or emotion, amen,
[1:26:29] is your evidence. He says something has
[1:26:32] got to happen down here that you have
[1:26:35] been changed and it changes your nature.
[1:26:40] Amen.
[1:26:42] Now you know look in the message why
[1:26:45] people so talks about brother talks
[1:26:47] about these people as I was saying they
[1:26:48] they come in and they they seem like
[1:26:50] they're rejoicing seem like they're
[1:26:51] believers going on and and they're there
[1:26:53] with you and that and the next thing you
[1:26:55] know they're out and then sometime
[1:26:59] they're back and then they're out and
[1:27:02] then they're back and every time they're
[1:27:04] like I know I got to get back in church.
[1:27:06] I just want to get back in church.
[1:27:10] Some of them, the thing is, friend,
[1:27:12] they're just it's just cycling because
[1:27:14] they get tired of the stuff they're
[1:27:15] doing. They get tired of what's
[1:27:17] happening. They get actually get tired
[1:27:19] of facing the consequences of what
[1:27:22] they're doing.
[1:27:24] And that's how this whole world is
[1:27:25] today. Nobody wants to be responsible
[1:27:27] for their own actions. They don't want
[1:27:30] to pay the consequences. If you ask them
[1:27:33] to pay the consequences, then all of a
[1:27:35] sudden there's something wrong with the
[1:27:37] police force. There's something wrong
[1:27:38] with the judge. You're be not being
[1:27:41] fair.
[1:27:47] I'll tell you this friends, none of them
[1:27:49] arguments that they present today is
[1:27:52] going to hold up on the day of judgment.
[1:27:55] They are not going to be able to come up
[1:27:57] before Almighty God and say, "You're
[1:27:58] just slinging out women.
[1:28:01] You're just being prejudice. You're
[1:28:03] you're you're just being this. You're
[1:28:05] being unfair.
[1:28:11] Brother Bam says this. He said, Brother
[1:28:13] Bam talks about and friends, he says
[1:28:16] there's a man-made homemade fig leaf
[1:28:20] religion.
[1:28:23] I preached on that some time ago and got
[1:28:25] to pointing at different quotes of
[1:28:26] brother Brandham bringing that out and
[1:28:28] brother Brandham saying about people
[1:28:31] that are teaching their children this is
[1:28:34] the way and this is how you do it. this
[1:28:36] is how you accept it. He says, "And
[1:28:37] they're teaching them wrong."
[1:28:40] I got to look that night. I thought
[1:28:42] about all the people around this message
[1:28:44] teaching their kids, look, as long as I
[1:28:46] love you and you love me, you can be
[1:28:48] there.
[1:28:50] Live like a devil, it's okay. I love
[1:28:52] you.
[1:28:55] All that ever loved brother Brandham
[1:28:58] and brother Vam L is going to be there
[1:29:00] on that day.
[1:29:08] They take isolated quotes.
[1:29:13] Jesus said, "If you love me, keep my
[1:29:16] commandments." I can tell you this,
[1:29:18] friend. If they can't even live the
[1:29:19] messages that Brother Brandham brought,
[1:29:21] they don't love him. That's right.
[1:29:28] Brother Brandham talked about people
[1:29:29] like that. He said, "These young people
[1:29:31] being taught things like that." He says,
[1:29:34] he says, "They're going to be
[1:29:36] disappointed on the day of judgment." He
[1:29:38] said, "On the day of judgment, they're
[1:29:40] going to be standing there saying, I
[1:29:41] have a right to be up
[1:29:43] there because of what they were taught
[1:29:48] deceived
[1:29:50] by the by the previous generation of
[1:29:53] message believers.
[1:29:59] Why? Why do people do that? It's their
[1:30:02] filio love. Yes, sir. They they so want
[1:30:06] their loved ones, their children and
[1:30:07] wants to be saved that they give over to
[1:30:10] their emotion. They give over to the
[1:30:13] gate of affection in their spirit which
[1:30:15] can be affected by the devil.
[1:30:20] Infected by the devil actually. Yeah.
[1:30:23] The devil can inject thoughts into
[1:30:25] there. Look at this. Brother Brandham,
[1:30:27] when his his wife was dying, he said she
[1:30:29] was laying down in the mor.
[1:30:32] Right. And he said, and he was standing
[1:30:34] there by his little baby, Sharon Rose,
[1:30:37] and she was dying. He said, the devil,
[1:30:39] he said, come and begin to talk to me.
[1:30:41] He says, and he was saying, look here,
[1:30:44] your baby's dying. Your wife's already
[1:30:46] dead down there in the morg. He said,
[1:30:48] your daddy died. He said, your brother
[1:30:51] died. all these things and you say God
[1:30:53] loved you. Brother Bam said what he was
[1:30:56] doing was he was working on this outer
[1:30:58] man. He was working on this outside and
[1:31:01] he said I got to reasoning on the
[1:31:04] outside of what the devil was telling
[1:31:06] me.
[1:31:07] He said but then something down in here
[1:31:09] spoke and said where did you come from?
[1:31:14] How did you get here? How did you even
[1:31:17] get to this? You came from a bunch of
[1:31:18] drunkards. That's right.
[1:31:21] Who brought you here? Who gave you that
[1:31:22] wife? Who gave you that child? Who gave
[1:31:25] you your life? Brother Adam said, he
[1:31:28] said, when that come up, he said, I
[1:31:30] said, though he slay me, yet will I
[1:31:32] serve him. There was something. What
[1:31:34] happened that supernatural that had made
[1:31:37] that change on the inside of him? It
[1:31:39] spoke out. Come past this outer court,
[1:31:42] came past this outer realm and spoke
[1:31:45] out. Broke through the realm that Satan
[1:31:48] could affect. Out came something that
[1:31:51] Satan couldn't touch.
[1:31:54] Praise God. Satan can't get to your soul
[1:31:57] when it's been sealed by the Holy Ghost.
[1:32:00] You're sealed to the day of redemption.
[1:32:03] People come in friends and brother
[1:32:06] Brandham said and people why people so
[1:32:07] tossed about said the problem is you
[1:32:09] know they come in he talks about the the
[1:32:11] the three room house right he says you
[1:32:14] know we've got and you know brother
[1:32:16] Brandham I'm breaking it down in a way
[1:32:17] because he would say I'm in a mixed
[1:32:18] audience so I'm going to break it down
[1:32:20] this way and he says we've got he says
[1:32:23] the kitchen he says and you sit there
[1:32:26] and you eat and things he said then you
[1:32:28] move on in to the living room he says in
[1:32:32] the living room you have fellowship. He
[1:32:34] said, "But then you go on into the
[1:32:36] bedroom and that's where you have the
[1:32:38] relationship." And he said, "That's the
[1:32:40] way that the that that it was set up.
[1:32:42] God had Moses to construct the
[1:32:46] tabernacle in the wilderness according
[1:32:47] to this." There was the outer court,
[1:32:50] friends. It was subject to the elements
[1:32:53] of the of the of the earth.
[1:32:57] If the sun was shining, it was bright
[1:32:59] and glorious and a beautiful day. When
[1:33:01] the sun went down, it was dark out
[1:33:03] there.
[1:33:06] People that live out there and their
[1:33:08] friends, they're up one day and down the
[1:33:10] next. They're affected by everything
[1:33:12] that's coming and going. My dad used to
[1:33:14] always say, "Don't be a thermometer." He
[1:33:19] said, "Be a thermostat."
[1:33:21] He said, "A thermometer is affected by
[1:33:24] the atmosphere, but a thermostat can
[1:33:26] create an atmosphere.
[1:33:28] [Applause]
[1:33:37] Then you move on into the next room, the
[1:33:39] inner court, the shoe bread, the
[1:33:41] countersticks, and it's lit up by the
[1:33:43] light from those seven candlesticks.
[1:33:46] Right? Sometimes it gets a little smoky,
[1:33:48] gets a little dim in
[1:33:50] there. People come to that, they've been
[1:33:52] justified. They're out here to the fin.
[1:33:54] They came on into sanctification. And
[1:33:56] many people stop there. They get a new
[1:33:59] spirit. They feel great. They feel free.
[1:34:02] They feel relieved because the unclean
[1:34:04] spirits left.
[1:34:07] But they never go on into the holiest of
[1:34:10] holies where the relationship with God.
[1:34:13] A personal relationship between you and
[1:34:17] God has to take place.
[1:34:20] Let me take you to another scripture.
[1:34:22] Matthew chapter 7. In Matthew chapter 7,
[1:34:25] Jesus says, "Many will come to me in
[1:34:28] that day." Talking about the day of
[1:34:29] judgment. Many will come to me in that
[1:34:31] day and say, "Lord, Lord, have not we
[1:34:34] done all these mighty works in your
[1:34:36] name?"
[1:34:38] Brother Adam said, Jesus never denied
[1:34:40] they done the works.
[1:34:43] That's good. But he looked at him and
[1:34:45] said, "Depart from me, you workers of
[1:34:48] iniquity,
[1:34:49] for I never knew you.
[1:34:54] Now you take that to what what is the
[1:34:56] meaning of that word in in the biblical
[1:34:58] sense that God used it. It was having a
[1:35:02] relationship.
[1:35:04] That's good. I never knew you. You never
[1:35:07] came on in to the Holies of Holies. The
[1:35:10] bedroom. Brother said, "Look, God is
[1:35:12] longing for somebody to come make love
[1:35:15] to him.
[1:35:18] You never come in and died out to this
[1:35:22] flesh. Amen.
[1:35:25] Hallelujah. That's so good.
[1:35:28] You got to die to go in there. Amen. And
[1:35:31] you got to want it. I'll tell you this,
[1:35:34] friend. I don't look, I don't know you
[1:35:37] people here today, your your status of
[1:35:39] where you are with God, but but let me
[1:35:41] tell you this, friend. Look, don't sit
[1:35:43] here and feel condemned if you're
[1:35:44] sitting here and thinking, "I don't got
[1:35:46] the Holy Ghost." Get it.
[1:35:53] It's a promise to you.
[1:35:59] Look, get desperate. Right.
[1:36:03] Listen, I had some things happen in my
[1:36:05] life some years
[1:36:06] ago, many, many years ago. And uh it
[1:36:11] caused me to question
[1:36:14] myself. And I'd also saw some preachers
[1:36:18] that I had confidence
[1:36:20] in. They they' done things that came out
[1:36:24] committing adultery and things. And it
[1:36:26] really throw me for a loop.
[1:36:28] and and I looked and and and and there
[1:36:31] was something that had happened in my
[1:36:32] life that made me start doubting
[1:36:35] myself. And so I I started searching,
[1:36:38] God, I got to have an answer to
[1:36:41] this. And so I I thought, well, how can
[1:36:44] I overcome these things that that that
[1:36:45] that I'm falling prey to, these traps?
[1:36:49] How can I overcome it? So I thought,
[1:36:50] well, I go to the message, how can I
[1:36:52] overcome? And so I listened to that
[1:36:54] message, how can I overcome? Wonderful
[1:36:56] message. It didn't answer my question
[1:36:58] that I
[1:37:01] had. So, why didn't it answer your
[1:37:03] question? I didn't have what it took to
[1:37:05] do that.
[1:37:08] So, I still had this
[1:37:10] question. So, uh I
[1:37:14] uh as it kept going on, I thought, you
[1:37:17] know, this is the thing. It was kind of
[1:37:20] I don't have the Holy Ghost. I ain't
[1:37:21] been born again. So, you've been
[1:37:24] preaching? Yeah, I'd been preaching. I
[1:37:26] started preaching when I was
[1:37:29] 21, but I realized I'm not born
[1:37:33] again. If I was born again, I wouldn't
[1:37:35] have done this
[1:37:37] stuff. Lord, I got desperate and and and
[1:37:40] and I went on a trip down to West
[1:37:42] Virginia, you know, and and my
[1:37:44] grandmother way back then, she was still
[1:37:46] alive. And and and I went and stayed at
[1:37:49] her house uh in Danville, West Virginia.
[1:37:51] And she had a little room I stay in up
[1:37:54] upstairs. And I went up there, friends,
[1:37:56] and I got desperate before God, and I
[1:37:58] got to praying. And I said, "God, I know
[1:38:01] I ain't got it, and I got to have it.
[1:38:02] I'm gonna die without it. I don't want
[1:38:05] to do all these other things. I don't
[1:38:07] want to fall prey to these things that I
[1:38:08] have fell prey to before. God, I know I
[1:38:11] ain't got it. I got to have it. I want
[1:38:14] it. And I ain't quitting until I get
[1:38:16] it." And friends, I prayed and I prayed
[1:38:19] until I got so tired, I couldn't stay
[1:38:21] awake. And I fell asleep.
[1:38:24] Next thing I knew, I woke up. I stand in
[1:38:26] the middle of the floor and I I was
[1:38:28] shouting and praising God and and so I
[1:38:31] thought, "Well, no." And so I just kept
[1:38:33] on praying. I started praying again.
[1:38:35] Lord, I got to have it. This ain't good
[1:38:36] enough for me. Just feeling good ain't
[1:38:38] good enough, God. I got to have it. I
[1:38:40] got to have an assurance that I got it.
[1:38:45] I got to know that I know, God. I got to
[1:38:47] have something. You know, this is the
[1:38:49] thing about us as humans. It's why
[1:38:51] people they want to base it on an
[1:38:54] emotion or or you know a feeling an
[1:38:57] experience they had in their feelings or
[1:38:59] they want to base it on speaking in
[1:39:01] tongues or somebody they want to base it
[1:39:03] on something that's tangible to the
[1:39:06] human reasoning
[1:39:10] look no if reasoning could give you the
[1:39:14] evidence that you have the Holy Ghost
[1:39:16] then reasoning can also tell you you
[1:39:19] ain't got it right amen
[1:39:22] And I already told you you if you get
[1:39:24] it, you can't lose it. Reasoning can't
[1:39:26] take it away from you. So reasoning
[1:39:28] can't give it to you. You know that old
[1:39:31] song we sing, the devil didn't give it
[1:39:33] to me, and the devil can't take it away.
[1:39:37] [Applause]
[1:39:39] Hallelujah. So I look, I I it can't be
[1:39:42] because of of preaching, praying, people
[1:39:46] getting healed. It can't be because of
[1:39:48] miracles. It can't be because I felt
[1:39:49] happy. It can't be because I spoke in
[1:39:51] tongues to rejoice. It can't be that. I
[1:39:53] got to have an assurance that goes way
[1:39:55] beyond anything that I can actually be
[1:39:58] reasoned out of.
[1:40:00] That's right.
[1:40:06] I friends look I was desperate. I said,
[1:40:07] "Look, I don't want to do things I've
[1:40:10] done before. I need God. I need
[1:40:12] something that is going to hold me that
[1:40:14] I got confidence. I want an
[1:40:16] ultimate
[1:40:18] I want an anchor. I want to be I want to
[1:40:21] be anchored in the rock.
[1:40:25] I don't want an anchor that's just
[1:40:27] dragging along the bottom of the ocean.
[1:40:30] I want something that gets a hold of
[1:40:32] something. I want something to get a
[1:40:34] hold of me.
[1:40:38] I was uh sometime later after that, I
[1:40:41] was down I was preaching in Florida at
[1:40:42] St. Augustine at brother Homer Brown's
[1:40:44] church and uh he he was always busy in
[1:40:48] his office and I stayed with him in his
[1:40:49] home. He had a little single wide
[1:40:51] trailer. I was staying there with him
[1:40:52] and his wife and so sometimes during the
[1:40:54] day I had to keep entertain myself, you
[1:40:56] know. So, he had spoken word books all
[1:40:59] over the house, you know, and so I think
[1:41:02] I found one on the back of the toilet
[1:41:04] and uh and I picked it up and I just
[1:41:06] started to read it, you know, and uh and
[1:41:09] and and as I got to reading it, I
[1:41:10] thought, "Oh, man. I got to read this
[1:41:12] whole thing." And and and so I went to
[1:41:14] brother Homer, I said, "Brother Homer,
[1:41:15] you got another one of these? I need to
[1:41:17] keep this. I need a copy of this." He
[1:41:18] said, "You can have that one, brother."
[1:41:20] The message was, "And knoweth it not."
[1:41:24] Boy, you can get a lot just from that
[1:41:26] from that
[1:41:28] title.
[1:41:30] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. In that message,
[1:41:34] Brother Bram talks about he says, "You
[1:41:36] take a woman that's out here not
[1:41:38] dressing right, wearing shorts and hair
[1:41:40] bobbed off and everything else, but she
[1:41:41] spoke in tongues." Said, "Try to tell
[1:41:43] her she ain't got the Holy Ghost."
[1:41:46] See that? That's He said that's her
[1:41:48] ultimate that she spoke in tongues.
[1:41:51] You're not going to convince her she
[1:41:52] ain't got it. See, here's the whole
[1:41:54] thing, friends. If somebody thinks they
[1:41:55] got it, then they're not going to know
[1:41:58] they need it. And if they don't know
[1:42:00] they need it, and they don't got it,
[1:42:01] they're not going to get it.
[1:42:07] Didn't the Bible say, "Knock and the
[1:42:09] door will be open. Ask and you shall
[1:42:11] receive. Seek and you shall find." If
[1:42:13] any man thirst, if they ain't thirsting,
[1:42:16] they ain't getting nothing. They ain't
[1:42:17] going for nothing. Right.
[1:42:21] We don't get up and walk over to the
[1:42:23] refrigerator to get a drink of water if
[1:42:24] we ain't thirsty. Right.
[1:42:31] Course I know sometimes you start
[1:42:33] getting dehydrated. You don't know
[1:42:34] you're thirsty and you are thirsty. But
[1:42:36] all of a sudden it hits you and you're
[1:42:38] like, "Boy, now I got to have it."
[1:42:39] Right.
[1:42:43] I look I had a discussion with a with a
[1:42:48] preacher and this preacher he was one he
[1:42:50] had actually fell into sin and I and and
[1:42:53] and I was going and visiting with him. I
[1:42:55] was preaching to his church and things
[1:42:57] and uh I was you know I felt really bad
[1:43:01] for him. You know first I thought
[1:43:03] everybody was judging him real bad you
[1:43:05] know being very judgmental. I thought
[1:43:07] look we all make mistakes.
[1:43:11] But more I got to looking at he was very
[1:43:13] one that got me to questioning how in
[1:43:15] the world could this man have the Holy
[1:43:16] Ghost and have done what he did if if a
[1:43:19] man could do that and have the Holy
[1:43:20] Ghost what in the world what assurance
[1:43:21] do we got?
[1:43:24] Because I was looking at me if he could
[1:43:26] do that with the Holy Ghost and man I
[1:43:27] ain't got a
[1:43:31] chance. So I I was preaching there and I
[1:43:34] and I and I brought out something about
[1:43:36] what brother Bham talked about body,
[1:43:39] spirit, soul,
[1:43:42] the three room triune being.
[1:43:47] After the service, preacher come up to
[1:43:50] me and he said, "Brother," he said, "you
[1:43:53] got that wrong." He says, "It's body,
[1:43:55] soul, spirit." He said, "The spirit is
[1:43:58] the most inner part."
[1:44:01] And I said, "Well, I just read right
[1:44:02] here." Brother Random said, "It was the
[1:44:04] soul."
[1:44:05] And so, you know, we had this long
[1:44:07] discussion and everything. And uh so I'd
[1:44:09] come back home. So I I went uh you know,
[1:44:13] back then we had dot matrix printers and
[1:44:15] you know, computers with a caveman in
[1:44:17] there chiseling stuff out in stone. And
[1:44:20] uh and so I I I went and what I did was
[1:44:23] I just I typed in three words into the
[1:44:26] folio views, the version we had way back
[1:44:28] then. I typed in three words, body,
[1:44:30] soul, spirit. I just typed in three
[1:44:32] words. No quotations, no nothing else.
[1:44:34] Just them three words. And then I just
[1:44:36] hit print
[1:44:37] all. And so here with that dot matrix
[1:44:40] printer. Y'all remember them? Any Yeah.
[1:44:43] Come scrolling out of there, you know,
[1:44:45] and uh when it all got all scrolled out
[1:44:47] there, had to fold it all up, you know,
[1:44:49] break all the the whole edges off the
[1:44:52] thing and, you know, and then going
[1:44:53] through had this whole scroll list. And
[1:44:55] I just started reading through it. And
[1:44:57] that when you print back then when you
[1:44:58] would push print all it started with
[1:45:01] whatever the first message was where it
[1:45:03] was mentioned like if it was
[1:45:05] 1956 that those three words were
[1:45:07] mentioned then it started in 1956 and
[1:45:09] then it started printing them in
[1:45:11] chronological order by date by by year.
[1:45:15] And so it went from 1956 all the way
[1:45:17] through say
[1:45:19] 1965. So I just started reading through
[1:45:21] it. Here's what I discovered. Everywhere
[1:45:25] that brother Brandham mentioned that
[1:45:27] prior to March of 1963, y'all know what
[1:45:31] happened in March of 63?
[1:45:33] Everywhere he mentioned that prior to
[1:45:35] March of 1963, the opening of the seals.
[1:45:40] Brother Brandon put the spirit as the
[1:45:42] innermost part. Yeah.
[1:45:45] But without fail, after those seals were
[1:45:48] opened, every message, every paragraph,
[1:45:51] every time he mentioned those three
[1:45:53] words, he put the soul as that innermost
[1:45:56] part.
[1:45:59] Now, this brother that I was having this
[1:46:01] conversation with, he went to the
[1:46:02] message of uh uh greatest battle ever
[1:46:05] fought. Believe it was preached in 1962.
[1:46:07] And in that message, brother Brandon
[1:46:09] puts the spirit as the innermost part.
[1:46:11] He puts those five gates in the realm of
[1:46:13] the soul.
[1:46:15] 1962.
[1:46:17] But now after 1963 when the seals were
[1:46:19] open, brother didn't do it that way.
[1:46:21] Brother man put them five gates in the
[1:46:23] spirit. And the soul is the innermost
[1:46:25] man. He said was controlled by either
[1:46:27] faith or doubt, belief or unbelief.
[1:46:30] So good.
[1:46:32] And so I when I showed this to that
[1:46:34] brother and told him, he said, "Well,
[1:46:35] brother, look," he said it both ways, so
[1:46:37] it doesn't really matter. You say it
[1:46:38] your way, I'll say it my way.
[1:46:41] Well, I'll tell you why it matters. That
[1:46:43] individual hadn't been born again, and
[1:46:46] he thought he was born again because he
[1:46:48] was dependent on an experience he had in
[1:46:51] his spirit realm.
[1:46:55] Yeah, that's good.
[1:47:01] Some years later after that, I was
[1:47:03] visiting another country, a place where
[1:47:05] one of the places he had been accused of
[1:47:07] doing wrong. And I was visiting there
[1:47:09] and I actually ended up taking a flight
[1:47:11] down to another island with a pastor
[1:47:13] from there that was involved in
[1:47:15] confronting that that particular brother
[1:47:17] about what he did over
[1:47:19] there. And he he he told me the whole
[1:47:22] story. The story didn't match what I had
[1:47:25] been
[1:47:30] told. Look, I'm telling you, I'm not
[1:47:32] trying to run nobody down. This is what
[1:47:34] my focus is on. Look, if somebody
[1:47:36] doesn't know they got it, I don't care
[1:47:38] how many years they've been preaching. I
[1:47:40] don't care how many meetings they have
[1:47:42] hosted. I don't care how popular or how
[1:47:46] well known they are in this message. If
[1:47:48] they haven't been born again, and if
[1:47:50] they can go out and not have something
[1:47:53] to hold them and commit adultery or
[1:47:55] something, then they were never
[1:47:57] converted.
[1:48:01] I'm not trying to be bad. I'm trying to
[1:48:04] open your eyes so you don't get Look, I
[1:48:06] I know you said under a great ministry
[1:48:07] here. And I'm not preaching anything new
[1:48:09] to you.
[1:48:11] But maybe somebody here needs to hear
[1:48:13] it.
[1:48:14] You know, sometimes we got to feed the
[1:48:16] sheep. Sometimes we got to feed the
[1:48:17] lambs.
[1:48:20] Hallelujah.
[1:48:26] Let me read this to you. This is in the
[1:48:29] message and knoweth it not. And this is
[1:48:30] what just answered that question for me.
[1:48:33] He said, now he said, he said, you see,
[1:48:38] here is the outside flesh. He said, I'm
[1:48:40] speaking to a mixed audience. I'm going
[1:48:41] to speak as your pastor, as your
[1:48:43] brother. Here's the flesh. It's weak. He
[1:48:47] said, a little lady walks down the
[1:48:48] street. Some young man just in his young
[1:48:50] age when he's 17, 18, 20 years old, 25,
[1:48:54] 30, walks around there and this young
[1:48:57] lady comes twisting every form of her
[1:48:59] body, walking with a pair of high heel
[1:49:01] shoes on, her stuck out in the front and
[1:49:04] back and dress is that high above her
[1:49:06] knees or or a pair of shorts on. He
[1:49:09] said, "Look at here. Here's this little
[1:49:11] lady twisting herself down the street.
[1:49:13] Here's a young man. His eyes catch it.
[1:49:16] He's a church member.
[1:49:18] He's a Pentecostal. He's whatever he is.
[1:49:21] But the first thing you know, there's no
[1:49:23] hold post in there.
[1:49:28] She'll say, "Hello.
[1:49:30] He's got curly hair, kind of nice
[1:49:32] looking, straight shoulder young man,
[1:49:34] maybe tried to live,
[1:49:35] right?" And and she started walking up
[1:49:38] to him. Now listen to this. This is what
[1:49:40] really opened it up for me. even a
[1:49:43] preacher.
[1:49:47] The first thing you know, he said, "What
[1:49:49] is it?" He says, "Is this out here?"
[1:49:51] That flesh desire and that spirit down
[1:49:54] here. Now, he's not talking about the
[1:49:56] Holy Spirit. He's talking about the
[1:49:57] spirit of the man is anointed saying,
[1:50:00] "Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it."
[1:50:03] But what will it do? It'll move right
[1:50:05] around there and hold. There it goes.
[1:50:07] First thing you know, he's trying to
[1:50:08] make a date with her. Wow. Wow. Wow.
[1:50:12] Even a preacher.
[1:50:18] He's guilty of committing adultery
[1:50:20] whether he touches her or not. But a
[1:50:23] genuine bornagain son of God, amen, he
[1:50:26] you can't do it yourself. It's totally
[1:50:28] impossible for a red-blooded male to
[1:50:31] walk before a female like that without
[1:50:33] something taking place. But when there
[1:50:36] is something on the inside, that little
[1:50:38] born again, something in here, though
[1:50:42] that man might have shouted, spoke in
[1:50:44] tongues, jumped, danced, everything
[1:50:46] else, anointed with the spirit, done all
[1:50:48] the signs and wonders that God said in
[1:50:50] there by his spirit. Jesus said, "Many
[1:50:53] will come to me in that day and say,
[1:50:54] Lord, haven't I prophesied in your name?
[1:50:56] Haven't I cast out devils in your name?"
[1:50:58] And he said, "Depart from me, ye that
[1:51:00] work iniquity." What's iniquity?
[1:51:01] Something you know you shouldn't do, and
[1:51:03] you do it anyhow. Depart from me, ye
[1:51:05] that work iniquity. I never even know
[1:51:09] you.
[1:51:11] But down on the inside, man, if that
[1:51:13] little tiepost is in there, that seed of
[1:51:16] God that was predestinated before the
[1:51:18] foundation of the world, I don't care
[1:51:20] what takes place, it holds him. It there
[1:51:25] to stay. Hallelujah. Let me just read
[1:51:28] that last sentence again and throw that
[1:51:30] back there with people who think you can
[1:51:32] lose the Holy Ghost. It's there to stay.
[1:51:36] Hallelujah.
[1:51:37] Hallelujah.
[1:51:44] Think about this, friends. Think about
[1:51:46] if you was trying to tie off a boat out
[1:51:49] in the
[1:51:50] water and and you tied that thing to
[1:51:53] something that's floating.
[1:51:56] You ain't got no tie, folks.
[1:52:00] That boat's going to float wherever that
[1:52:02] float goes.
[1:52:05] But boy, if you if you anchor that thing
[1:52:08] off somewhere, you tie it into a rock,
[1:52:11] get a hold of something that ain't going
[1:52:12] to move.
[1:52:15] Tie it off to a post on the pier that's
[1:52:17] poured in concrete that can't move. That
[1:52:20] boat ain't going nowhere. Amen.
[1:52:25] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:52:27] You ever notice this? You You look at a
[1:52:29] boat and somebody got an anchor. They
[1:52:31] don't put that anchor on a fishing line.
[1:52:36] That's good. They don't tie that anchor
[1:52:38] with a piece of thread.
[1:52:42] They don't go get a spool of thread out
[1:52:44] of mama's sewing box and tie off that
[1:52:46] anchor.
[1:52:48] Friends, look, they tie it off with a
[1:52:51] rope that's going to hold or a chain.
[1:52:54] And if it's with a rope, you know, you
[1:52:56] just can't tie any knot.
[1:53:00] If there was any sailors in here, they
[1:53:01] could tell you that there's a whole art
[1:53:03] to tying
[1:53:09] knots. But friends, look at
[1:53:13] this. That anchor is going to hold if
[1:53:16] it's if it's got a hold of something
[1:53:18] that ain't going to move. Boy, there's a
[1:53:19] scripture I got to have. I got to find
[1:53:21] it. It's got to be down in here
[1:53:22] somewhere. Hallelujah. If I can't find
[1:53:25] it, I'll just paraphrase it. Hallelujah.
[1:53:35] All right, I'll just paraphrase. I wish
[1:53:37] I find it. I really, but you remember
[1:53:40] Jesus speaking and Jesus talks about
[1:53:43] that if you build your house on the rock
[1:53:48] or if you build your house on the sand.
[1:53:52] That's good. He said, "If you build your
[1:53:55] house on the sand, then the storms will
[1:53:57] come."
[1:53:59] He says, "And the house will fall. And
[1:54:01] great will be the fall thereof. But if
[1:54:04] that house is built on a rock, he said
[1:54:08] the storms can come your way.
[1:54:11] Everything can come your way. Satan can
[1:54:13] throw everything he's got at you, but
[1:54:17] that house will stand because it's
[1:54:19] founded on a rock." Amen.
[1:54:21] Amen.
[1:54:25] Jesus said, "Who do men say that I, the
[1:54:27] son of man, am?" Well, some say that
[1:54:29] you're liar. Some say you're one of the
[1:54:31] prophets. Some, but who you say? Peter
[1:54:34] speaks up and says, "Thou art the
[1:54:35] Christ, the son of the living God." He
[1:54:37] said, "Flesh and blood hath not revealed
[1:54:39] this to you. But my father which is in
[1:54:41] heaven, and upon this rock I'll build my
[1:54:44] church, and what? The gates of hell
[1:54:47] cannot prevail against it.
[1:54:50] [Applause]
[1:54:53] Amen. Isn't that something? He didn't
[1:54:55] say hell can't prevail against it, which
[1:54:57] we know he can't, but he actually
[1:54:59] specified the gates of hell.
[1:55:05] Brother Bham said, "In this last day,
[1:55:08] the gates of hell have been opened, and
[1:55:11] Satan has loosed every demon power from
[1:55:14] hell out against this bride.
[1:55:21] But when the enemy comes in like a
[1:55:24] flood, the Lord will lift up a standard
[1:55:26] against
[1:55:30] Hallelujah.
[1:55:32] Every time under the the first to the
[1:55:34] fourth seal that a power from Satan was
[1:55:37] loosed, there was an anointing loosed
[1:55:40] from God to for the people to overcome
[1:55:44] that.
[1:55:46] That's so good. God, that's so good.
[1:55:49] Look, greater is he that's in you. Look,
[1:55:51] look at the scriptures. Amen. The
[1:55:53] scriptures testify left and right of
[1:55:55] this. Greater is he that's in you than
[1:55:58] he that's in the world.
[1:56:08] that's in the world. When you've got
[1:56:10] that born again, not friends, look,
[1:56:13] you're not out there not a court eating
[1:56:15] mana that's going to pass away. People
[1:56:16] eat that mana and they rejoice, they
[1:56:19] shout, and everything else, they go out
[1:56:20] the door and by Monday they're down in
[1:56:23] the dumps again.
[1:56:26] But I'll tell you what, if you ever get
[1:56:27] into that holies of holies, amen, here
[1:56:31] is the rest wherein I'll cause the weary
[1:56:33] to rest. I am the Sabbath. I am the Lord
[1:56:37] of the Sabbath.
[1:56:39] You have an experience with the Sabbath.
[1:56:42] The Lord of the Sabbath. And it brings a
[1:56:44] rest to you. Yes, sir. It doesn't do
[1:56:47] away with all of the issues and
[1:56:49] circumstances that come against you in
[1:56:51] your flesh out here. Yeah. But it gives
[1:56:53] you friends a peace and rest that you
[1:56:56] can stand in the midst of it. You can
[1:56:59] stand right there when the when Satan
[1:57:01] gives you reasoning that you got no way
[1:57:03] around it in your mind that tells you
[1:57:06] you ain't going to make it. You're lost.
[1:57:07] Look at you. God don't love you. God
[1:57:09] don't care. Look what happened. Your
[1:57:11] wife died. Your baby's dying. Your daddy
[1:57:13] died. Your mama died. All this. Though
[1:57:15] he slay me, yet will I serve him.
[1:57:21] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:57:24] Preachers leave this message and they
[1:57:26] start putting videos out on YouTube and
[1:57:28] everywhere else, you know, trying to
[1:57:30] say, "Look, you be the judge. You reason
[1:57:32] whether this is right or not, this
[1:57:34] message." And what the prophet said here
[1:57:36] about that, you know, he said that these
[1:57:38] men died on the bridge. You can't find
[1:57:40] that anywhere in in in in the news
[1:57:43] history
[1:57:46] anywhere. So all of a sudden, they don't
[1:57:48] believe anymore.
[1:57:51] You know what? I don't even got time to
[1:57:53] waste listening to their argument. Say,
[1:57:56] "Yeah, but what if they're right?" They
[1:57:57] ain't. See, how do you know they ain't
[1:57:59] right? You ain't never heard them. Cuz
[1:58:01] something supernatural has happened down
[1:58:03] in here, sir.
[1:58:07] Friends, and I'm going to tell you
[1:58:08] something. That supernatural that
[1:58:10] happened down in here, it didn't come
[1:58:11] from some denomination. It didn't come
[1:58:13] from from some church. It didn't come
[1:58:15] from some man. It came by God from the
[1:58:19] end time word of God. the truth that was
[1:58:22] delivered to this bride in the end
[1:58:24] times.
[1:58:25] That's right. Brother said there's two
[1:58:27] kinds of Christians or he says two
[1:58:29] phases actually of Christians. He says
[1:58:30] there's the intellectual conception.
[1:58:34] Friends, look, I I grew up, you know, I
[1:58:36] I first grew up in in organization when
[1:58:39] I was real little and I I can remember
[1:58:40] all of it. I can remember the shouting,
[1:58:42] dancing, speaking in tongues, all those
[1:58:43] things. And I'm not I'm not throwing off
[1:58:45] on them, but I remember all that. I also
[1:58:48] remember coming into this message till
[1:58:50] being real
[1:58:51] young. I remember listening to brother
[1:58:54] the tapes of brother Brandon when I was
[1:58:55] just a
[1:58:58] child. I remember the very first time I
[1:59:00] was sitting over in Cleveland, Ohio on
[1:59:02] West 94th Street up upstairs on a porch
[1:59:05] in in a little child's lounge chair. You
[1:59:07] know, me and my mom and dad and dad
[1:59:09] brought his real to real tape player out
[1:59:11] there on the porch and we were listening
[1:59:12] to brother Brandham and the first time I
[1:59:14] heard brother Brandham talk about when
[1:59:16] that man in the checkered shirt.
[1:59:20] Yeah, that's good.
[1:59:23] Boy, I tell you what, when I became a
[1:59:24] teenager, somebody said, "Hey, brother
[1:59:27] Biscll is going to be speaking over in
[1:59:29] Lima." Said, "Uh, we're going to go."
[1:59:31] Said, you know, he's the one brother
[1:59:32] Bannon mentioned in there about that
[1:59:34] checkered church. I said, "Bro, I can't
[1:59:35] wait to get there.
[1:59:37] I got there and he came out in his suit.
[1:59:39] He must have went and got that thing
[1:59:40] tailored fit, you know, somewhere from
[1:59:42] I'm not talking about off the rack at
[1:59:44] Coohl's,
[1:59:46] but it was a nice nice suit. I
[1:59:49] wonderful. I love nice suits. But I was
[1:59:54] disappointed. Some years later, I went
[1:59:56] up and asked him. I told him, I said, "I
[1:59:58] was disappointed first time I heard you
[2:00:00] speak when I was a teenager." I said,
[2:00:01] "Because you did not have that check at
[2:00:02] church."
[2:00:05] He said, "Brother Jerry, I don't even
[2:00:07] know what happened to that checkered
[2:00:11] shirt." But you know, friends,
[2:00:14] hallelujah. Oh
[2:00:17] my.
[2:00:18] Hallelujah. I had an intellectual
[2:00:21] conception. I I I heard these things of
[2:00:23] the message and things. Brandon, I
[2:00:25] believed Brother Brandon was a prophet.
[2:00:27] I believed it was true. There was no
[2:00:29] time ever in my life, even when I would
[2:00:31] backslide, that you could convince me
[2:00:33] that he wasn't the true prophet of God
[2:00:35] or that this end time message wasn't the
[2:00:38] truth or that maybe I needed to go try
[2:00:40] some other church or religion. That
[2:00:42] never worked with me.
[2:00:45] But yet, all I had was an intellectual
[2:00:50] conception. And that's that's why I had
[2:00:52] nothing to hold
[2:00:56] me. But brother Ram says there's the
[2:00:59] intellectual conception, but then
[2:01:00] there's that supernatural that happens
[2:01:02] down in your heart, your soul. It
[2:01:04] happens down in there and it converts
[2:01:06] you.
[2:01:08] It changes the soul. A new life is born.
[2:01:13] It it brings to life. Look friends, a
[2:01:16] preacher doesn't put the seed gene of
[2:01:18] God in you. No,
[2:01:21] you if you are a seed gene of God,
[2:01:23] you've always been a seed gene of God.
[2:01:25] You are born here, born into this world,
[2:01:29] born in iniquity, shaped in, you know,
[2:01:31] born speaking lies, shaped in iniquity.
[2:01:34] But friends,
[2:01:36] listen, you were born with that seed
[2:01:38] gene of God in you. Amen.
[2:01:41] Amen.
[2:01:42] Real quickly, brother M said, "What's
[2:01:44] the difference between the the priests
[2:01:46] down at the temple in Jesus day and the
[2:01:47] woman at the well?" She was an illame
[2:01:50] woman.
[2:01:52] Said, "But what was the difference
[2:01:53] between them?" He spoke to the priests
[2:01:54] and they called him Beloveub, the prince
[2:01:56] of devils. Spoke to her and she said,
[2:01:59] "Sir, I perceive thou a prophet."
[2:02:03] Goes down into the city and says, "Come
[2:02:05] see a man that's told me everything I
[2:02:07] ever done. Is not this the Messiah?
[2:02:10] Brother said, "What was the difference
[2:02:11] between them?" He said, "The priest down
[2:02:14] at the temple had no representation in
[2:02:16] here." There was no seed gene of God in
[2:02:20] there.
[2:02:21] When that word struck it, it had no
[2:02:23] effect. There was nothing to bring to
[2:02:25] life. But when it struck that ill thing
[2:02:28] dead in her sins woman, it struck the
[2:02:31] same gene of God that was on the inside
[2:02:33] of her soul. And it brought that to
[2:02:35] life.
[2:02:42] She didn't call him a devil. She said,
[2:02:44] "This is a Messiah."
[2:02:48] Friends, I don't even know if that woman
[2:02:50] could read. I don't even know whether
[2:02:52] she'd ever read the scrolls or not.
[2:02:56] She was actually an outcast, a
[2:02:57] Samaritan, half Jew, half Gentile.
[2:03:01] It didn't matter. I like what Jesus said
[2:03:03] to his disciples before he went down. I
[2:03:05] got need to go by there.
[2:03:08] Why? There was a redeemable soul there.
[2:03:12] [Applause]
[2:03:14] If you were a child of God, you were a
[2:03:17] redeemable soul. You might have been
[2:03:19] born in sin. I don't care what you did
[2:03:21] in this world. But there was something
[2:03:23] down in there. All it was waiting for
[2:03:26] was the light of God to strike it and
[2:03:28] you came alive in your due season.
[2:03:32] That's being converted.
[2:03:34] that's being changed.
[2:03:38] Paul says, "A new creature in Christ
[2:03:40] Jesus." That's so good. And then Paul
[2:03:44] talks about creation. I got to close.
[2:03:46] See, Paul talks about creation. It says,
[2:03:49] "All of creation groanth and dwellth
[2:03:51] together, waiting for what? The
[2:03:54] manifestation of the sons of God." Amen.
[2:03:59] To which the body change. Amen. to win
[2:04:03] this outside realm, friends, is changed
[2:04:07] to match the change that happened in
[2:04:09] your soul. If you have been converted,
[2:04:12] if you have been born again, friends,
[2:04:15] you got something that's going to hold
[2:04:17] you.
[2:04:19] I'll tell you, the devil used to always
[2:04:20] try to convince me, not that the message
[2:04:22] is wrong, but that I wasn't one of them.
[2:04:27] You ain't going to make it in the
[2:04:29] rapture. Anytime I couldn't find mom and
[2:04:32] dad, first thought hit my head was, "Oh
[2:04:34] man, a rapture took place and I missed
[2:04:41] it." Brother Dan Daisley, y'all remember
[2:04:44] him? He gave a testimony years ago and
[2:04:46] he said he he was out, you know, he went
[2:04:48] around evangelizing. He was out driving
[2:04:50] and he said and he was out with actually
[2:04:52] Brother Henry Green. The two of them
[2:04:54] were out together. So they stopped at a
[2:04:56] gas station to fuel up, you know, he
[2:04:57] went into the bathroom. He said, "It
[2:04:59] came out and he couldn't find Brother
[2:05:00] Henry
[2:05:03] anywhere." He said, "And the devil said
[2:05:06] to him, uhhuh, the rapture happened.
[2:05:09] Your pastor was taken and you didn't
[2:05:11] make
[2:05:12] it." He said, "At first that thought hit
[2:05:15] me." He said, "Then I thought, wait a
[2:05:16] minute, I'm here." He said, "You lying
[2:05:19] devil. If the rapture took place, I
[2:05:20] wouldn't be here either."
[2:05:25] That's right. God. Hallelujah.
[2:05:28] I'll tell you friends, when you've been
[2:05:29] converted on the inside,
[2:05:32] the devil can't tell you you ain't going
[2:05:34] to make it cuz you know you're not
[2:05:35] dependent on your works. My evidence is
[2:05:39] not my good works.
[2:05:42] Amen.
[2:05:43] Look what Paul said. When I would do
[2:05:45] good, evil's present.
[2:05:47] We We got to fight this flesh every day.
[2:05:50] We got to die to this flesh every day.
[2:05:53] This flesh would make mistakes. We got
[2:05:55] to repent of of of the mistakes of this
[2:05:58] flesh that we fall prey to
[2:06:04] now. But don't count everything up as
[2:06:06] being a mistake.
[2:06:10] Preacher goes out and commits adultery.
[2:06:12] He didn't make just make a mistake. He
[2:06:14] didn't have the typost.
[2:06:20] People make up things. Preachers make up
[2:06:22] things, friends. what their homemade
[2:06:25] religion around this
[2:06:27] message. They they preach people their
[2:06:29] opinion of things instead of actually
[2:06:31] just staying with the truth of the word.
[2:06:35] They take where it says uh a woman
[2:06:38] shouldn't wear a garment pertaining to a
[2:06:39] man. Then they get up and they preach,
[2:06:40] look, you sisters, if you're wearing a
[2:06:42] jean skirt with a zipper in the front,
[2:06:43] that's a garment pertaining to man.
[2:06:45] Y'all take that off. Well, that preacher
[2:06:47] that preached that, friends, he's out
[2:06:48] set on social media at a picnic table
[2:06:50] drinking beer now and don't even believe
[2:06:52] this message.
[2:06:54] man-made dogmas.
[2:06:57] We ain't living by that stuff. But I'll
[2:07:00] tell you, if a change is happening here,
[2:07:02] friends, this outside will dress like
[2:07:06] what happened on the inside.
[2:07:10] You don't look, I don't get up and start
[2:07:12] preaching, hey y'all quit cutting your
[2:07:13] hair. Hey, y'all wear don't wear pants.
[2:07:15] Hey y'all do this. Hell, let's get born
[2:07:18] again.
[2:07:20] Amen.
[2:07:22] Amen. Years ago, my dad was pastoring
[2:07:24] down another area and there was a young
[2:07:27] couple that come to God. They had two
[2:07:28] little children and and and the woman
[2:07:30] came in. She had a a skirt way up above
[2:07:32] her knees, you know, and she wore on big
[2:07:34] old baldy ear bobs on her ears and short
[2:07:36] hair and everything, you know, and and
[2:07:38] and some old, you
[2:07:40] know, sister better than now come up to
[2:07:43] my dad and said, "Uh, Brother Brown, you
[2:07:46] want me to go over and tell her she
[2:07:47] shouldn't be wearing that stuff and
[2:07:48] straightening her out on that?" My dad
[2:07:49] said, "No, you leave her alone."
[2:07:52] He said, "When she gets born again, when
[2:07:54] God gets a hold of her, that'll change."
[2:07:57] And you know, Brother Bam said this.
[2:07:59] Brother Brandham's likened it like this.
[2:08:00] He said, you know, in the fall when the
[2:08:03] leaves drop off the tree cuz Brother
[2:08:06] Brandham was asked the same question.
[2:08:07] People said, "We need to get them up and
[2:08:09] get these people around the altar and
[2:08:10] get them to stop dressing and wearing
[2:08:12] these things, you know, before they can
[2:08:13] get the Holy Ghost." Said, "No." He
[2:08:15] said, "Look, when a tree drops, look, I
[2:08:17] I've got we live in the woods and we've
[2:08:19] got a lot of different types of trees,
[2:08:21] but I'm going to tell you something
[2:08:22] about a beach tree. A beach tree is very
[2:08:25] stubborn about letting go of its leaves.
[2:08:28] They It'll hold its leaves all through
[2:08:30] the winter all the way up to
[2:08:36] spring." Brother Bam said, he asked the
[2:08:39] man said, "Do you have to go out there
[2:08:40] in the spring and pick off all them dead
[2:08:42] leaves still there before the new leaves
[2:08:44] will come out?" He said,
[2:08:46] "No, when the new leaf comes out, the
[2:08:49] old leaf falls off." When that person's
[2:08:52] born again, friend, them old leaves are
[2:08:53] going to fall off. They'll dress right.
[2:08:55] They'll act right. They'll live right.
[2:08:56] But it won't be because they're living
[2:08:58] by a set of rules and laws and legalism.
[2:09:02] Something that can't hold them.
[2:09:04] That's right. That ain't what saves you.
[2:09:07] What saves you is is having Jesus Christ
[2:09:10] on the inside.
[2:09:12] Amen. Amen.
[2:09:15] Hallelujah. Oh man. Praise the Lord.
[2:09:18] Let's stand here. I ain't ever going to
[2:09:19] stop. You know what it is, friends? I've
[2:09:20] had this message burn on my heart and I
[2:09:22] ain't preached at home yet. And as a
[2:09:24] pastor, you know, I preach at home a lot
[2:09:26] of times. I preach in series. So I I'll
[2:09:29] start out, you know, and and
[2:09:32] preaching a message and I may be on that
[2:09:35] thing for months.
[2:09:39] So I can't preach it all to you today.
[2:09:46] Let me give you a quick
[2:09:47] testimony. I don't know how long I
[2:09:49] preached today, but however long I
[2:09:51] preached should prove to you that God
[2:09:53] had healed me mentally and has restored
[2:09:56] me.
[2:10:05] When I was going through that and I was
[2:10:06] trying to push and try to try to act
[2:10:08] like I was preaching, I had trouble
[2:10:10] getting 30 minutes in.
[2:10:12] And a lot of times I was just reading
[2:10:13] off paper.
[2:10:19] I started cycling through old notes of
[2:10:22] stuff I had studied in that and just cuz
[2:10:24] I couldn't even feel like I could get
[2:10:25] inspiration for anything else. I'll tell
[2:10:28] you what now, friends, you can't shut me
[2:10:31] up. God set me free. He healed my mind.
[2:10:34] He set me free from that. I'm telling
[2:10:36] you, I'm rejoicing.
[2:10:39] Hallelujah. I know what it's like to be
[2:10:42] set free from sin. I know what it's like
[2:10:44] to be set free from that old man of
[2:10:46] Jerry. You
[2:10:48] know, but now now I know what it's like
[2:10:52] to be to be delivered from something.
[2:10:55] You know, people got a stigma about it.
[2:10:56] They think, well, you know, heart
[2:10:58] disease, uh, uh, sugar diabetes, uh,
[2:11:01] high blood pressure or cancer even or
[2:11:03] whatever. You know, look, mentalness is
[2:11:06] illness, too. It's an affliction of the
[2:11:09] devil just like those others
[2:11:11] afflictions. Yes, it is. But friends,
[2:11:14] he's the Lord thy God that healthth all
[2:11:17] our diseases. And that is a disease.
[2:11:20] Hallelujah. Look, many times that
[2:11:23] disease gets triggered by trauma that
[2:11:25] happens in your life. That's right.
[2:11:28] That's right. Men experience PTSD that's
[2:11:31] been in war and wartime situations and
[2:11:34] and saw horrible things and they
[2:11:36] experience post-traumatic stress
[2:11:39] syndrome
[2:11:41] and and it throws them back to where
[2:11:43] they feel like they're right back to
[2:11:45] where they were when they saw that and
[2:11:47] that happened to witness. Look friends,
[2:11:48] that happened to me when I I was the one
[2:11:51] discovered somebody who had committed
[2:11:52] suicide,
[2:11:55] right?
[2:11:56] Man, I suffered from that really bad.
[2:12:02] God delivered me. Yes, he did.
[2:12:04] Hallelujah. I read what Brother Brandham
[2:12:07] said. Uh he said when I'm driving down
[2:12:09] the road, he says, "I keep a cross
[2:12:11] hanging on my mirror in my car." Right.
[2:12:13] And and and he said, "I I just looked at
[2:12:15] that cross and I plead the blood." You
[2:12:17] know, and and so when when I read that,
[2:12:20] I thought, "Well, okay." So I went out
[2:12:22] and I got me a cross. And you know, I
[2:12:24] was a soldier. So I went out and got me
[2:12:26] a cross that was a a camouflage cross,
[2:12:28] you know, and uh and I I put that on a
[2:12:31] piece of raw hide and I I put it around
[2:12:33] my neck. And any time that that start
[2:12:36] coming on me, I start feeling that I I'd
[2:12:37] grab a hold of that cross there, you
[2:12:39] know, and I'd say, "Lord, I'm pleading
[2:12:41] the blood." Now, it wasn't no virtue in
[2:12:43] that cross. That's right. There was no
[2:12:45] virtue in that that little piece of
[2:12:46] metal. That's right. But there was
[2:12:48] virtue in what I believed.
[2:12:51] Yeah. And I believe if that helped the
[2:12:54] prophet, it helped me. But it was
[2:12:56] actually the word of God through the
[2:12:58] prophet.
[2:13:01] Oh, I tell you what, friends. His word
[2:13:03] to set you free.
[2:13:06] Hallelujah. I don't want to go back into
[2:13:08] my testimony here. Let me sing this song
[2:13:11] to you. Amen. If I can.
[2:13:13] Amen. Goodbye yesterday. I'm living in
[2:13:17] the light of a new day. I won't waste
[2:13:20] another minute on my old ways. Praise
[2:13:23] the Lord. I've been born again. Goodbye

[2:14:19] lived in. Goodbye yesterday. I'm living
[2:14:24] in the light of a new day. I won't waste

[2:14:30] the Lord. I've been born again. Goodbye
[2:14:34] yesterday. The spirit of the Lord is
[2:14:37] upon me. Hallelujah. These picss are
[2:14:40] breaking right and left. Hallelujah.
[2:14:42] I'll just sing it. They're playing it.
[2:14:43] Amen. Hallelujah. Goodbye yesterday. I'm
[2:14:48] living in the light of a new day. I
[2:14:51] won't waste another minute in my old
[2:14:53] ways. Praise the Lord. I've been born

[2:15:12] You rescued me out of the mess I was in.

[2:15:18] sing. Now I'm dancing on the grave that
[2:15:21] I once lived in. Goodbye yesterday. I'm
[2:15:25] living in the light of a new day. I

[2:15:58] Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. God bless you.
[2:16:02] Amen. Praise the
[2:16:05] Lord. Hallelujah.
[2:16:11] Go ahead, brother. Born again. There's
[2:16:15] really been a change in
[2:16:22] me. Oh, born
[2:16:25] again just like
[2:16:29] Jesus said.
[2:16:34] Oh, I've been born again and all because

[2:22:00] one far above this world and all its
[2:22:13] carals Lord
[2:22:15] Jesus be with me.
[2:22:21] Lord, I want to live each day as it
[2:22:24] would be the last one. Oh, far above
[2:22:28] this world. It's
[2:22:35] gone. Hallelujah. Let's sing that. He
[2:22:37] touched me. He touched me. Oh, I was
[2:22:41] shackled by a
[2:22:46] heavy burden.
[2:22:50] I was
[2:22:52] beneath a load of
[2:22:56] guilt and
[2:23:01] shame. Oh, but within the hand of
[2:23:07] Jesus touched
[2:23:10] me.
[2:23:12] Oh, and
[2:23:14] now I am no
[2:23:17] longer the
[2:23:20] same.
[2:23:23] Oh, he touched me. Oh, like that with
[2:23:26] Jacob. Oh, oh, he touched me.
[2:23:34] and
[2:23:36] all the joy that floods my
[2:23:42] soul. For I know that
[2:23:46] something has
[2:23:49] happened. And now, oh, I
[2:23:55] know he touched
[2:23:59] me and
[2:24:01] made me whole.
[2:24:05] [Music]
[2:24:07] And ever
[2:24:09] since I met his
[2:24:13] flesh
[2:24:15] savior. And ever
[2:24:19] since he cleansed
[2:24:22] me, he
[2:24:24] [Laughter]
[2:24:27] whole. Oh, I shall never
[2:24:33] cease to praise my
[2:24:37] All through our
[2:24:39] life, every expression,
[2:24:42] hallelujah, is the pulsation of that
[2:24:46] life
[2:24:48] for he touched me. Thank God.
[2:24:54] Oh, he touched
[2:24:56] [Music]
[2:24:58] me and
[2:25:02] know the joy that bless my
[2:25:08] soul. All because I
[2:25:11] know something happened.
[2:25:16] And now, oh, I
[2:25:22] know he touched
[2:25:25] me and
[2:25:27] made me
[2:25:30] whole. Let's sing that. Ever since Ever
[2:25:36] since I met his
[2:25:40] fleshless
[2:25:43] savior. And ever since he cleansed me,
[2:25:50] he made me whole.
[2:25:56] And I I'll never
[2:26:00] cease to praise
[2:26:04] him.
[2:26:06] I'll
[2:26:07] shout it while
[2:26:11] turning. She
[2:26:14] rose. Why? Because he touched
[2:26:19] me.
[2:26:21] Oh, he touched me.
[2:26:27] and
[2:26:29] all the joy that floods my
[2:26:35] soul. For I know that
[2:26:39] something wonder has happened.
[2:26:43] And
[2:26:44] now I
[2:26:48] know he touched
[2:26:52] me and
[2:26:55] made me
[2:26:57] whole. It is well. It is well. It is
[2:27:01] well.
[2:27:06] When
[2:27:08] peace
[2:27:09] like a
[2:27:13] river
[2:27:17] attendeth my way.
[2:27:22] When
[2:27:25] sorrows like
[2:27:27] sea
[2:27:29] below
[2:27:34] ro
[2:27:36] for whatever
[2:27:40] [Music]
[2:27:42] Oh yes,
[2:27:43] [Music]
[2:27:46] you have taught me to save
[2:27:52] It is well. It is
[2:27:54] well. It is
[2:27:57] well
[2:27:59] with my
[2:28:05] soul. It is
[2:28:12] well with my soul.
[2:28:20] Oh, it is
[2:28:24] well. It is
[2:28:27] well with my soul.
[2:28:32] Oh, let's just worship him now. Let's
[2:28:35] thank him.
[2:28:36] No
[2:28:40] Satan should
[2:28:42] buff it, though
[2:28:48] trials should come.
[2:28:51] Faith
[2:28:53] is blessed
[2:29:05] assurance that
[2:29:08] Christ
[2:29:10] have
[2:29:13] regarded my
[2:29:16] help.
[2:29:17] Unless you
[2:29:19] stay and have Yes, sir. Shed his own
[2:29:27] blood
[2:29:28] for my
[2:29:33] soul. Oh,
[2:29:35] hallelujah. It is well.
[2:29:41] is well
[2:29:43] with my soul.
[2:29:48] With my soul. Oh, with it is well. It is
[2:29:54] well. It is well. It is well with
[2:30:00] my Yes,
[2:30:02] Lord. Hallelujah.
[2:30:05] Oh glory my
[2:30:09] sin. Oh the
[2:30:13] bliss of this
[2:30:19] glory. Oh hallelujah.
[2:30:23] My
[2:30:24] sin
[2:30:26] not in
[2:30:28] part
[2:30:30] but the
[2:30:40] whole
[2:30:42] you I'm crucified with you.
[2:30:46] [Music]
[2:30:47] There
[2:30:49] is no more.
[2:30:53] Praise the Lord. Oh,
[2:30:56] praise the
[2:30:59] Lord. Oh my
[2:31:03] soul. Hallelujah. Oh, could we just give
[2:31:06] him a wave offering? It is well. Thank
[2:31:10] you, Lord Jesus. It is well.
[2:31:14] Oh, with my soul. with my soul.
[2:31:23] It is
[2:31:26] well. It is
[2:31:30] well with my soul.
[2:31:36] Hallelujah.
[2:31:38] Oh, and
[2:31:41] Lord. Hey.
[2:31:44] Yes sir. Oh yes.
[2:31:47] Amen.
[2:31:49] [Music]
[2:31:53] Beside when the
[2:31:56] clouds
[2:31:58] be rolled
[2:32:00] back
[2:32:03] as strong.
[2:32:09] All the
[2:32:12] trump
[2:32:14] shall
[2:32:16] resound and the
[2:32:20] Lord
[2:32:21] shall receive. Even so,
[2:32:27] even
[2:32:29] so. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm
[2:32:33] ready. Hallelujah.
[2:32:39] Oh, it is well.
[2:32:43] Yes, it is well. The blood's been
[2:32:47] applied with my soul. The token is
[2:32:51] presenting in my soul.
[2:32:56] It is well. It is well. It is way
[2:33:04] with my soul.
[2:33:09] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:33:12] Hallelujah.
[2:33:14] Oh, thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:33:19] I tell you friends, when you I I know I
[2:33:22] say it quite a bit, but it's very true.
[2:33:25] Where would we be without the message of
[2:33:27] the hour? Amen.
[2:33:29] And when when you know this by now from
[2:33:31] me saying it, the message of the hour is
[2:33:34] it's more than books or tapes. And
[2:33:35] that's not really what it is. It's
[2:33:37] Christ. Amen. That's who the message is.
[2:33:40] Yes, it is.
[2:33:43] And to bring the whole purpose of the
[2:33:45] gospel is relationship.
[2:33:48] Is to bring a
[2:33:50] settleness. Is to bring it to where it's
[2:33:52] no longer I that liveth, but Paul that
[2:33:55] but Christ that liveth in me. Amen.
[2:33:59] That's the whole
[2:34:00] objective. And I think it was just so so
[2:34:03] beautifully spoken this morning. Amen.
[2:34:06] And the urgency. And I I
[2:34:09] just I know that the Lord just didn't
[2:34:11] come down and just speak to us in this
[2:34:15] way just to take our time up. He doesn't
[2:34:18] do that.
[2:34:20] But God is mindful of our needs.
[2:34:24] And you might say, "Well, Brother
[2:34:25] Samuel, why don't you why don't you pull
[2:34:27] on people?" Because a lot of times if
[2:34:28] you pull on people, you have to continue
[2:34:30] to pull them. But when the word goes
[2:34:33] forth and brings conviction, that's how
[2:34:35] it happened on the day of Pentecost. It
[2:34:37] was not a preacher pulling them to
[2:34:39] pulling them. I'm going to count it
[2:34:40] down. No, that that those tactics only
[2:34:43] work so long. But see, when the word
[2:34:46] went forth, the question came from the
[2:34:48] people, what must we do to be saved?
[2:34:51] Conviction strikes the heart. And I I
[2:34:53] just say, you know, just as the Lord
[2:34:55] brought it so clearly here this morning,
[2:34:57] you know, the word doesn't come to
[2:34:59] condemn, it comes to bring conviction.
[2:35:02] And then when we can look, when we can
[2:35:04] be honest with God and look at where
[2:35:06] we're
[2:35:07] at, then God can begin to move on our
[2:35:10] heart to actually bring our heart into
[2:35:13] the condition it needs to be. Right. You
[2:35:15] know, Brother Brandham made one simple
[2:35:17] statement when he's talking about that
[2:35:18] of of that soul and that nature and
[2:35:21] souls in prison now. He said as soon as
[2:35:23] he can get that soul, that first nature
[2:35:26] to agree with the word, he quickly moves
[2:35:29] in and kills it. Amen.
[2:35:32] Because God, that's all God needs is
[2:35:35] that that that place to come to that
[2:35:37] moment to where it moves in in that way
[2:35:39] and begins to agree with the word. And
[2:35:41] you know what? For everyone in here
[2:35:43] that's already been born again by the
[2:35:45] spirit of God, you know how that's come?
[2:35:47] Because the spirit of God, it's worked
[2:35:50] through justification, sanctification,
[2:35:52] and then him moving on your life. It
[2:35:54] leads us to the slaughter like it led
[2:35:57] the lamb to the slaughter. Hallelujah.
[2:35:59] It's the same Holy Spirit leading us to
[2:36:01] what? The separation. When you we see
[2:36:03] that in our life, there's things that
[2:36:04] come forth. That's God's grace. You know
[2:36:07] why? To bring us to a place of a
[2:36:09] certainty in this hour. I tell you, I
[2:36:13] know the Lord well enough to know he
[2:36:15] would come down and speak that if it's
[2:36:17] just for one person. Yes. Amen. Amen.
[2:36:21] But how true that is that once it gets
[2:36:24] on the inside, it'll reflect itself on
[2:36:27] the outside.
[2:36:30] And you might you might wonder and say
[2:36:32] well why did you know why when I'm
[2:36:34] listening to the message and why is it
[2:36:36] at times when it's being preached about
[2:36:38] dress and clothing all of things when it
[2:36:40] is said in that way it's not that that
[2:36:43] is the objective dress and clothing and
[2:36:45] this that's what it is. We're living in
[2:36:48] an age of mixture.
[2:36:51] We're living in an age where this word
[2:36:54] has been hacked all to pieces.
[2:36:57] [Music]
[2:36:58] And the reason God comes down is not to
[2:37:01] point us to that as an objective, but to
[2:37:03] show that there's not been a full true
[2:37:07] conversion and a relationship with him.
[2:37:10] I'm glad for that. Aren't you? Amen. I'm
[2:37:13] glad the Holy Spirit comes down in such
[2:37:15] a way to speak to our hearts so
[2:37:17] personally. Cuz I tell you right now,
[2:37:19] the rapture is on us. Yes, it is. We're
[2:37:21] we're we're living in the final moments.
[2:37:26] You might say, "Brother Samuel, if it if
[2:37:28] it carries another five years, we're
[2:37:30] living in the final moments."
[2:37:32] And not one person in here has the
[2:37:34] promise of tomorrow.
[2:37:37] This is why today is the day of
[2:37:38] salvation. This today is that moment and
[2:37:41] that time when the word of God has
[2:37:43] spoken to our hearts. I tell you, every
[2:37:45] one of us, it's a time to take
[2:37:46] inventory, take account because you know
[2:37:50] what? When you're at rest with your walk
[2:37:52] with God, I mean, when it's a rest where
[2:37:54] you can, your life is founded in the
[2:37:57] scriptures, then you know what? You
[2:37:59] become a channel for the Holy Spirit to
[2:38:01] work through to others. And that's what
[2:38:04] we are to be, branches. Branches. Is
[2:38:07] that right? So God's whole purpose is to
[2:38:10] settle us. I I thank God for that for
[2:38:13] that message this morning. Amen. Amen.
[2:38:16] And let's let's act upon it. It's one
[2:38:18] thing to hear it, but the prophet took
[2:38:20] two messages and spoke hearing,
[2:38:23] recognizing, and acting on the word of
[2:38:25] God. We got to do something with what
[2:38:28] we've heard. Amen. Amen. I think brother
[2:38:33] brother Jerry gave an example. There's
[2:38:35] many I there's many I could go
[2:38:36] throughout this this including myself
[2:38:40] that where really the change took place
[2:38:42] was not within the four walls of a
[2:38:44] church
[2:38:46] but it's when God begins to deal with
[2:38:47] your life and many times brother Bram
[2:38:50] you'll hear this and I want you just to
[2:38:52] listen carefully it's now when the heart
[2:38:55] there's a lot of sisters in here that's
[2:38:56] been in labor all right and you know
[2:38:59] sometimes they put sometimes to get
[2:39:01] they'll get labor going they'll get that
[2:39:03] drip going they say we got to get it
[2:39:04] going. That's what the preaching of the
[2:39:06] gospel does. It gets it going. Now, it
[2:39:10] may not happen here within these four
[2:39:13] walls in this next moment, but it's like
[2:39:14] the prophet when those came forward in
[2:39:16] adoption part one, he looked at many of
[2:39:19] them as they stood there and he prayed
[2:39:20] and he said, "And you watch your life a
[2:39:22] few days from now."
[2:39:25] Why? Because their heart had been open
[2:39:27] to the word of God. Their heart had been
[2:39:30] set to a place of travail. So just don't
[2:39:32] let this word pass away here this
[2:39:34] morning. Take that word and say, "God,
[2:39:36] that's what I want in my life."
[2:39:38] And I want more of it. I want more of
[2:39:41] it. I want more of him. I want more of
[2:39:44] him. I want less of me and I want more
[2:39:46] of him. But don't settle for anything
[2:39:48] less than a full conversion. Amen. Amen.
[2:39:52] Because that's what this message it
[2:39:54] produces. Don't you love the Lord?
[2:39:58] God is so good in he is. Amen. And sure,
[2:40:01] it's good to be good to be together here
[2:40:03] this morning. Amen. And you know what?
[2:40:05] I'm looking forward to the testimonies
[2:40:06] that come right out of this service
[2:40:09] because God's promised his word won't
[2:40:11] return back to him void.
[2:40:13] God puts service after service after
[2:40:15] service together to where it all comes
[2:40:17] down. All we can say is it's been
[2:40:20] God. Is that right? God's putting it all
[2:40:24] together. Amen. God bless you. I want to
[2:40:27] remind you that the fireside fellowship
[2:40:30] this this evening at 5:30. Amen.
[2:40:33] Certainly be good. Might need to bring
[2:40:36] your jacket and bring a bring a chair.
[2:40:40] Um let's just bow our heads in a word of
[2:40:43] prayer.
[2:40:46] Father, collectively, Lord, from our
[2:40:48] hearts, I believe I can stand here,
[2:40:50] Lord, and say on the behalf of each one
[2:40:54] of us in here, thank you.
[2:40:58] Lord, we thank you for the word that was
[2:41:01] delivered here this
[2:41:05] morning. Lord
[2:41:08] Jesus, that's your desire for our lives
[2:41:11] as relationship.
[2:41:14] Your prophet told us if we could just
[2:41:17] even to be able to imagine. He said like
[2:41:21] a pipe and there's such force wanting to
[2:41:25] come down through that
[2:41:27] pipe. He said that's how the Holy Spirit
[2:41:30] is wanting to get into your life
[2:41:34] fully.
[2:41:35] Lord, we don't want to just walk under
[2:41:38] an anointing of a church. We don't want
[2:41:41] to walk
[2:41:42] around where it's at. We want to get
[2:41:45] beneath the
[2:41:46] blood. I pray, Father, right here this
[2:41:50] morning, Lord, as we just move from the
[2:41:54] presence of this building and one
[2:41:56] another, but never from your presence.
[2:41:58] Lord, I pray here this morning, may dear
[2:42:01] God, there be further travailing pains,
[2:42:06] Lord, to every heart and every life,
[2:42:09] Lord. each one that Lord would be in
[2:42:12] need of that. And Lord, if they're
[2:42:13] unaware of that, may you make them aware
[2:42:15] of that. May they Lord take with courage
[2:42:18] and stand before you and say, "Lord,
[2:42:20] with all of my heart, I want my life to
[2:42:24] be filled with you, Lord. I want to be
[2:42:27] fully converted. I want to be fully
[2:42:29] changed, Lord. I don't even want, like
[2:42:32] the prophet said, a big toe out from
[2:42:34] underneath the blood." We want it all.
[2:42:38] And we're so thankful to know that Lord,
[2:42:40] what the blood of bulls and goats could
[2:42:42] never do. It could never divorce sin, it
[2:42:44] could never take care of something. It
[2:42:47] could never take care of that blood that
[2:42:49] wouldn't allow an
[2:42:50] illegitimate born child in. But that was
[2:42:54] before the blood of Jesus Christ
[2:42:57] came. Now there's something strong
[2:43:00] enough. Lord, every one of us fell under
[2:43:02] that category.
[2:43:04] We were in need of something that was
[2:43:06] strong enough to be able to take care of
[2:43:09] sin's question to be able to take care
[2:43:12] of that first nature. Lord, now
[2:43:15] Father, you don't wrestle with us. You
[2:43:19] don't fight with us. You only ask us to
[2:43:23] believe, to ask him. So Lord, I pray,
[2:43:27] Father, may you just continue to move in
[2:43:30] every heart and every life for your
[2:43:33] word. it will accomplish and cause to
[2:43:36] prosper to that which it's been sent and
[2:43:39] received and it'll produce. How we thank
[2:43:42] you for that.
[2:43:44] Father, we love you. Ask you'd go with
[2:43:47] your children, Lord. Be with them as
[2:43:48] they go into this, Lord, the next work
[2:43:52] week. I know many, Lord, of us have a a
[2:43:54] holiday tomorrow and things, but may you
[2:43:56] just be with each one in a special way,
[2:43:59] Lord.
[2:44:00] [Music]
[2:44:01] Father, we love you. We appreciate you
[2:44:06] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:44:08] Amen. God bless
[2:44:10] you. Amen. I heard Paul Paul already
[2:44:13] said it and I would like to echo it. I
[2:44:15] certainly want to thank all of
[2:44:17] the not only the veterans but many that
[2:44:20] gave their lives that we enjoy the
[2:44:21] freedom that we have right here today.
[2:44:24] But I'm thankful also for that ultimate
[2:44:25] sacrifice. Aren't you? Amen. Of the lamb
[2:44:28] of God. Amen. And ain't God good? Amen.
[2:44:32] God bless you. You're dismissed in the
[2:44:33] name of the Lord.
[2:44:36] Even though my spirit is low and it
[2:44:40] seems I can hardly go, but
