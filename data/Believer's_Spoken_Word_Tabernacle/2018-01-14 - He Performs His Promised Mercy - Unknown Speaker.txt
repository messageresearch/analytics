morning and which really what a precious a precious testimony that that is when we can truly have that confession that it is indeed wealth that is that is a very very precious reality we just want to say greetings to our visitors here this morning may God bless each and every one of you and I won't try to call you by name because I believe in somebody out but we want to just remind you we'd sent out the email in regarding to that of the rescheduling of brother George Smith where he was supposed to be here with us this past Thursday and Friday and then from the weather so that's been rescheduled February the 8th and February the 9th to ask you to keep that in prayer also I think it was mentioned as well but let's keep the Costello family and prayer brother bill Costello brother passed away suddenly yesterday so let's remember them in prayer just comfort them in this time also for brother Davis he over the crest is here but mister crest the Lord willing we'll be going home on January the 23rd that's been that's been a month's ordeal it's been there but yet within it all God has been proving himself many UPS many downs but yet in the midst of it God has proven himself faithful let's just continue to hold our sister up in prayer before the throne of God I I always admonish you in doing that because sometimes when we see someone maybe they can finally make it here and it's like we'll let up on praying with if God would have let up on Peter when Peters shackles would have been off he still was in prison but they kept praying until he showed up there at the house I believe when God God's desire that when we go when we're praying for things we want we know that God's desires for full deliverance and so let's continue keep sister crescent prayer she's doing very well brother David had text me in regards to the therapy that she's been going through and even within the lungs just a clear report on that so we give the door sister Carmen Bosley in prayer as well she's recovering there at home I know that as I spoke to her last night and even her husband Michael had called me and they just they just were astounded by breath during the time of the food and different ones that's when over with them and even as sharing the food that was broadened going over and praying with her that was just you know the thing when you would come down to fit into these times like this we are a body if the greatest Dettman that we can do is operate independently amen we are a body and and the work of how God moves within our lives in it that's it's a witness you know we can speak about a lot of things but this was this has been such a witness and her husband had called me there on the phone on Friday and he said I I don't know what to say I don't know what to say he said I've never seen this before in my life so you know it the one thing we won't we definitely want to ask God to help us to be tender and be sensitive to the needs of one another within the body amen and sometimes you know as we've said before it's not just even food but even through things that you can have others that are here that maybe you don't know they're going through anything physically or whatever but just sometimes a kind word sometimes a car sometimes just a phone call sometimes just the text and you know just something like that that God can really speak and encourage his people with and I'm so thankful for the body of Jesus I watch you I'm think I'm so so thankful for not only the part that's here but I think before the body of Jesus Christ around the world amen we want to before as we turn our attention to the word we want to lift the mission offering this morning and and then go right into the word so if the brothers will come if you'd like to stand with me and musicians I'm finished we'll go right into the word from here also would we mention to you that as it comes as you just would remember it continue remember the column brother the Collins family and the Thompson family in prayer and that the Lord would just continue to to strengthen them as it comes to your heart just continue to to keep them in prayer amen so let's just pray here Heavenly Father Lord as we turn our attention Lord God to you Lord into the word this morning Lord we stand here in great need Lord because without you Lord Jesus were as helpless as helpless can be father the Lord we're looking to you that you would just Lord and move on the scene among us in a very special and very personal way Lord that you would just come Lord and fulfill what you have determined and desire to be fulfilled in this service Lord may our faith Lord may it rise within you Lord and may you grant to each and every part in every life Lord those desires that Lord that they have in you I pray that Lord that you would just receive all the glory Lord just meet us Lord here this morning Lord God as we Lord desire to look into your word and we know that we need you Lord to to take us in Lord and that our understanding would be open father Lord we pray that as we lift Lord this mission offering now Lord we ask that God that you'll take father and Lord that you would multiply and direct it or God the Father Lord by your spirit Lord Jesus we pray Lord we just want to give you all the honor and glory Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen as we look here in the word here for a few moments let's go to Luke chapter 1 verse 67 I just pray that the God will just help me to deliver this this morning the part of this as he is so pressed it on my heart in in Luke chapter 1 verse 67 I'm just gonna read these scriptures here just to take a background and set a direction of where we're going to go and his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost and prophesied saying blessed be the Lord God of Israel for he hath visited and redeemed his people and hath raised him up and horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David as he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets which have been since the world began that we should be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all that haida to perform the mercy promised to our fathers and to remember his holy Covenant the oath which he sware to our father Abraham that he would grant unto us that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemy might serve him without fear in holiness and righteousness before him all the days of our life may God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I'd like to just take a thought from here and we've really been the mercy of God I'd like to look at that thought on that he performed his promise mercy and when we look at it here in the scriptures where we would draw this from in verse 72 and verse 73 that God's coming in the fulfillment of his word all that he has spoken and everything has has spoke to one great achievement that that God would have and we see how that everything you know God and how that he would direct the prophets and and his servants everything was so focused on this coming of of salvation and of this Redemption that God had promised and when we look at it the that this the performing of the mercy that is promised I I think of the scripture here that is just just so precious that had just been looking at in Micah 7:20 and hear Micah at the end of this chapter he says thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob and the mercy to Abraham which thou has sworn unto our fathers from the days of old and I'll tell you without God's mercy you and I would stand hopeless if it was not for the mercy of God so when we look at that that performing of his mercy that mercy that was promised we we recognize that it's God he's coming to fulfill his word God is not going to do something outside of his word now we understand that God when God reveals his word that God can add to that revelation by unfolding more of an understanding that lays sealed within that revelation such as when he gave the revelation of the coming son and of that seed and God continued to unfold all that was within that revelation of the promised Messiah and how that you know it would come through Abraham and then how that here coming through that of the of the lineage of David God is is unfolding all that was within that revelation at first and he unfolds when it is necessary that his people would need to know these things and be directed by that word yet we know that it's God after the word has been spoken God Himself comes behind his word to fulfill that word and to confirm it and when we look at this of the great mercy of God I think of how that when I've studied and been just studying this on for weeks of of the great mercy of Almighty God and many of the of the writers and things like that or the rabbi's and different ones they refer to this great mercy of God of the word that is used in many instances of his sad which is his goodness and his faithfulness and his kindness but yet it's as as that would be emphasized that it's not just a steadfastness we we we are thankful that God is faithful to his word but yet if that faithfulness is without love a steadfastness of loved and the faithfulness itself we would all be dissolved and swallowed up but there must be a steadfastness in love and in other words God is not fulfilling his word out of mere duty it's just something that he has to do that that's not how God fulfills his word when God fulfills that this promise to you and and confirms it to your life as he's confirmed it to our life when he moves - you know - to move within your life that's God fulfilling his word not out of duty he's fulfilling it out of his love to his word and how that you have given yourself to that word to say Lord I believe what you said and I believe that that's from me Lord and God moves with it with a great love to fulfill his word and I'm grateful for that and we look at that one of the things that has stuck out to me within that of thee of the riders as hound that when we look at the mercy of God one described the mercy of God to be likened to that of the glue of the Covenant if there was not anything that would hold to the Covenant more mercy itself it brings where God Himself is not just committed to his word but I want you to think of this for a moment just let me drop this for a moment if God is fulfilling his word and he's having to look at everything all of the mistakes and all the failures and everything else if there's not a something that is present where God Himself is able to fulfill his word then here is God coming to fulfill his word and here he is having to overstep all of these all of these faults all these mistakes all these shortcomings but it's within him to take care of all of these things I hope you're with me this morning on that that another words God cannot go ahead and fulfill his word with the grudge God cannot fulfill his word was something in his heart are you with me so it so there must be that of a resolve for God to be able to move forward and fulfill his word because as God is dealing with humanity but yet God is looking deeper than just your flesh or my flesh he's looking down into the depths of our heart and that's the whole thing that God desires to woo to himself and we find that within here that God Himself begins to make a way and I'll refer to different places in the scripture here but if we find that God himself makes a promise here in genesis 3:15 after the fall has come about God makes a promise and this promise is in his mercy they Adam and Eve at that point we started to look at a little bit last week but they didn't deserve this but yet God steps forward and he performs his mercy in that he says I will give I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed and it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel God himself already he's promised now within just this verse of scripture think of this just this one verse of scripture lays even they-they fulfillment and the whole advent of the Messiah within this verse of scripture steps out not only that the Gentile ages but men in the millennium the future whom all because of this scripture here God uttering his word and it is by virtue of a promise there is nothing in this promise that contains if nothing there's no if in this promise but God has declared I will then you find of how that God he moves you know after the dealings in the times of Noah and God he moves to deal with an Abraham and that's what to work with here this morning of how that God dealing with Abraham's life because here God has said he's going to perform and we know that he did that but we see even the culmination in our day and time and even after were taken off of the performing of the mercy that is promised there to Abraham and to the patriarchs and to all the father's all that oath that he had made and we see in in Genesis 12 verse 1 where God speaks to Abraham and verse 1 and verse 2 and verse 3 and God lets him know I get the out of the land or the country from your kindred and from your father's house and unto a land that I will show thee and I will make thee a great nation and I will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing and I will bless them that bless thee and curse them that curse thee and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed right here just even within the very first three verses which we know were already uttered to Abraham when he was down there in the earth of Chaldees God has already laid down there is and there is an issuing in of promise right here that is not an issuing of if but God has said I will this is God himself it when you notice I will it's not we will but I will God's not needing the we it's that I'm gonna perform this I will do this so all of those things that are laid out and and brother Brennan puts it like this and the message the masterpiece he said we begin now taking man he began now taking man from his covenants of saying that if you will I will and he began with the man called Abraham and he gave to Abraham a covenant unconditionally and every time he would start a masterpiece Satan would get in because the word when he started with Abraham he said I've already done it now this is unconditionally not that if you will I will but I've already done it he said now the great sculptor he is deep termined to have this masterpiece this is God's perfect will this is God's determination it's not it didn't enter in with will yet God never here and even in the very beginning in the Garden of Eden God gave His Word and God even in the giving of that word the conditions if you will do this then I will do this if you will do this I will do this everything it was based on a condition but here God has given his covenant unconditionally non conditionally doesn't mean that there's nothing for us but yet be unconditional part is that he himself is the performer of his own work he's the one who makes the promise he's the one the performance but yet it requires us to believe but you and I can not even believe unless he gifts us to be able to believe so it's all coming back to him but he's determined to have this masterpiece and he goes on and talks about our Abraham from the patriarchs he said now what God was doing he's rebuilding the masterpiece that is fallen you know you would think that even go directly when building the masterpiece that was fallen you would think that he would do it directly to making a man once again or bringing forth that image but God remember his image everything all of God's works they have foundation they have foundation is that right yet God doesn't move outside of the foundation of his word anything that God does he moves by the foundation of his word so God just did not start and start immediately with working and laying in the imagery of the body there but God is laying a foundation now we see the the you know the the counter to that even when you look in the book of Revelation when it talks about that beast that is sending you know in and out of the pit and it had no foundations there's nothing to base it on but see God Himself he has a foundation when God doesn't work there's a foundation and he wants this to be very clear that the film son of his image and masterpiece is going to be the foundation that is rooted in faith in love in grace and imperfection all of this is going to be a foundation I'll tell you that is the foundation and the cornerstone of Jesus Christ himself that is the foundation of which the Church of the Living God is built upon is the very election and faith and grace and love and perfection of the Lord Jesus Christ God has set forth this foundation got a foundation so God as he's preparing that foundation and you you look at how Abraham of where God has said I will and I will and you know we were understand that Abraham himself he's ordained this is what I want you to keep in mind I want you to keep that in mind of this mercy of God it being the glue to the Covenant here is Abraham and God speaks to him he's down in a condition that is not a condition that would merit nor would it invite that of God speaking to him but God speaks to Abraham and Abraham begins to respond he he's uniting with that voice he walks out of the land and yet or out of there of the earth Cal DC comes into the land of promise as much as Abraham is ordained I want you to catch this as much as he's ordained he's got to come God's provided way then may seem like an awful simple statement but just because he's ordained does not mean that God is going to pass by certain things in his life what is that the mercy of God the mercy of God is not passing over your difficulties your problems all your troubles that is not God's mercy passing over but his mercy is to supply the antidote and what is needed in order to bring about what each Oh glory be to God so he had to come God's God's provided way and he did come God's provided way he showed it was displayed it was displayed that it was of the four donación of Almighty God he display of the prevailing power of a gene of God laying in a life it actually displayed that and showed and here you find Abraham here he comes into a situation he's in the land and I know these things are familiar but I want you to just take account of this he's in the land and a famine comes up and Abraham goes down he begins to go down into Egypt and sojourn there God never told him to go down there God never let him to go down there but Abraham walking by his own natural sights and you know what this is what Abraham this is a part of Abram this is what Abram there's no doubt about it this is what he's always done when trouble has come are you with me see these are the thing maybe his daddy was that way as well maybe his great grandpappy was that way all of this but you see God did not make a choice in time the choice was made before anything else existed yet God chose his word and his word will prevail [Applause] so he's acting he just is a normal action flight from something just take off and run and it goes down and he tells the lie that he tells but I want you to notice this I want you to think of this for him this is something might seem so simple but I want you to consider this what if God had not showed up to Pharaoh what if God had not showed up to Pharaoh you say by the Samuel the mercy of God would have overrode no God's mercy does not override his word his mercy works in unity with his word as a matter of fact that mercy is his own person the angel of his presence that's his mercy Amen to come and and bring that word into fulfillment but notice here's Abraham I wonder what Abraham was doing he saved as far as maja you know my life is spared I'll tell you everything is good truth man that was a tight fix my goodness I'm glad we got out of that but you see God's looking beyond Abraham's not seeing the seriousness of this because what he doesn't know God knows God knows that Sarah is the appointed wound Sarah his part of the promise God knows that but in the midst of it see Abraham could not even keep what God gave him the deep God never told him to leave the Lamb Abraham could not keep that he ran from that but yet in the mess and mercy of God the grace of God the Prophet calls it like this he said the grace of God appeared to Abraham how did it appear to Abraham by declaring to Pharaoh the woman you have she belongs to that man that was God's grace it was not Abraham Abraham wasn't over there oh god please Lord send a visitation to pharaoh lord please send a visitation let me tell you something this was not abraham's determination this is god's determination amen as far as with abraham this would have been it but god is determined and God's grace moves in his mercy in the fulfillment of that word I tell you you know it's like the Prophet puts that he says Abraham tested God's patience and he said we test God's patience that's the truth God told him one thing and he went and did another thing if it was just God just looking at his word and mercy was not there it would have been done but you see God has confidence that he is the one and he will bring forth what are you spoken hey man you believe that we are part of that word that word that God Himself that word has God spoke his word we were there in him we were represented in that word its Christ God will have a fulfillment to that I want you to watch this here you know brother Branham talks about in this in the message of grace is that Abraham was supposed to stay in that land but he went down into the you know Philistines he went down there to sojourn to get out of the famine things was a little hard up in his country so he went down there to sojourn down there with him he done exactly what God told him not to do but yet the grace of God appeared to him and kept favor from taking but King from taking his wife he said Abraham said it's my sister he lied about it listen now but yet the grace of God held him because he repented he was willing to repent why was there mercy why was mercy kept why was mercy held he was willing to repent not because he was perfect but he was willing to repent and anybody that's willing to repent the grace of God still goes for you the grace of God is searching for you and that goes for year.the backsliders this morning the grace of God is still looking for you if you'll just repent God's grace is sufficient I want you to look at this in the scripture for a moment I don't read anywhere in this scripture nowhere do I read in here where we find Abraham as it were coming before God and saying Lord forgive me for telling that lie boy how do I got the sleepers awake now most of you don't find this you don't find it in the scripture as far as the words that said but you said by the same I believe he repented sure you do I do too but how do we know that he repented is repentance me just coming and say brother he not forgive me I'm wrong I'll forgive me brother Enoch and I continue to do the same thing that's not repentance you see I can have the right words and it looks like man this guy repented but if you if your actions don't change you ain't repented come on somebody this is here God is laying out the plan of his mercy you want mercy mercy is not lip service mercy is not I'm sorry because a lot of people are sorry but they're sorry for the way things turn out you understand that's called worldly sorrow I'm sorry that things are the way they are the way they are my life that's not repentance that's worldly sorrow but godly sorrow sorrow if unclear pendants are repentance that's not to be repented of glory be to God and it shows it shows itself in a life is that right Abraham notice in Genesis 13 here Abraham goes up in verse 1 out of the land of Egypt he takes his wife he takes all he had lot with him into the south and in verse 4 notice he in verse 3 sorry he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel under the place where his tent had been at the beginning between Bethel and hey I under the place of the altar which he had made there at first and there Abram called on the name of the Lord what did he do he went back he repented he went back to where the reprove ER had reproved him and he went back to where he knew God spoke to him you see it ought to be something that was in a life if God's not speaking to you that ought to bother you if he don't bother you that God ain't talking to you there's something wrong if my wife wasn't talking to me man I tell you what I need me up I'm not talking about honey to-do list and everything else but those things come part of the love package too but you understand what I'm saying if she wants it if there's things that she wasn't expressing to me if there's things like the Prophet would tell us in Corinthians book of Corrections he said if my lives and my wife would not come and put her hand upon mine and express her love to me he said I would begin to question and say what's wrong now I know we look at it and say well brother sandal it ought to be that of the husband expressing to the wife that is true but the wife can only reciprocate the love that she is shown or expressed to how do we love the Lord we don't love him with our own love we love him with the love that he has expressed through us it is reflected back to him listen you mean I gotta put my hand on him and and tell me what a good provider he is and tell him about this and tell him about that I know that man is full of faults I know but so are you so am i come on now but yet remember the scripture says not you dwell in the praises but he dwelleth in the praises of his people how did the Prophet tell us to get his attention when we're praying when you're praying he says begin to just start with a little worship I love you appreciate you in or whoosh start solution you'd be surprised you might get biscuits instead they're burnt them things these good my gonna be in tight in here now then we do now to stop this gear right here but here God Abraham noticed God doesn't tell him where to go God didn't tell him where to go but yet Abraham knew this is where God spoke to him and he has not spoke to me in a long way you see God's desire is continued to have communion when our lives not just draw us to a church not bring us to a gathering his desire is to so employ our lives and to have Dallas ship with you and I and hear this expression is repentance is to turn from and turn unto and move to what God is calling us back to and yet you find that within this right here God himself he still doesn't speak to Abraham Abraham comes here in warships he comes right back to the place where he has left God and he begins to worship but yet God doesn't speak to him because there's still something that is there that God told him to get rid of before so once again the grace of God now watch mercy mercy is not going to come all the way over and say hey for him I love you so much oh my Abraham you're so precious oh my a more have your one of my sons Abraham I come my eyes covered I can't see nothing you're doing huh that's not mercy that's called disgrace but mercy is going to deal with this Mercy's going to deal with this problem so what mercy does mercy allows strife to enter into the camp whew strife between Kurtzman's why if there had not been that strife I wonder if the strife had not been there would Abraham have separated within that time but God had to allow a situation to arise that Abraham could say this ain't gonna work you choose where you want to go I'm going the opposite way what was Abraham doing he was reflecting what was written in him God had already spoken now he's dying to it he's done the grace of God appears and the strife itself is allowed to arise but notice how Abraham handles the strife Abraham didn't say you're a hitchhiker you ought to be happy I just brought you along no Abraham doesn't despise him but Abraham let's neighbor him recognizes that this cannot this type of a union cannot go on it's not moving in Abraham's life God can't tell he wants to do jobs already spoke in this water and now it's up to Abraham to act in faith in his word and even when God can look and say I see lot still with you but yet God Himself will not just come right down and make a visit and say hey lots still here your daddy's dead but lots still here God didn't come down that way but God allowed a situation to arise and Abraham discerned it this cannot go on what's happening here God's performing mercy Jamie Brown think of this the Prophet places it like this I don't know if I had this port up there not been out of Abraham's covenant confirmed in 1961 builder says God told him to separate himself away from his kindred away from his people but Abraham he said like an ordinary man God never run him out or back to his homeland for doing it but Abraham never did yet blessed of God until he separated himself from all his people he didn't get run out of the land what kept him from being run out of the land mercy you say well how could mercy it if this is what God is calling for because God is able to look down into the depths of Abraham's heart where you and I right now could have we were to look at it lord have mercy in legal astern Sweden wrote him off but Nehemiah said concerning that by inspiration in Nehemiah 9 that god looked down upon Abraham and found that he had a faithful heart it was not the mistakes that God was allowing to him God saw the faithfulness of his heart he not only believed but he also received divine assistance to be able to believe that's the same thing for you and I he never did get blessed of God until he separated himself from all his people God kept back the blessings came back to bless things until L Abraham would respond correctly to the Word of God oh my oh that's that my desire is the Lord I want to respond correctly I want to respond right this morning I want to respond if you tarry another day I want to respond right tomorrow I want to respond right why's that the blessings themselves will continue to flow in my life hola he took his father along you know friends as I said it does something if we don't if we're if I we're not living in that place to where our delight is in the Lord and we're looking for the Lord every day you know he didn't just come to church and look for God well I'm waiting for God to show up and he comes the church God wants more than that God wants to have a relationship with you he wants to show up and visit you not just during the daytime he'll visit you at the nighttime he'll visit you in the early morning God will visit you there in your house he'll visit you there on your job this God's desire is to have a relationship with you not a church life a church life you can turn on a church life you can turn off but that ain't what God came for this is not the mercy of God if that's all God wanted we wouldn't need mercy but we need mercy we need mercy what to lead us to that desire that God has oh my can we find after Abraham here he separates he separates from lot and after he separates the Lord said unto him after he was separated from lot lift up now thine eyes and look from the place where thou art northward southward eastward and westward for all the land which thou seest to thee will I give it into that seed forever and I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth so that if a man can number the dust of the earth then shall thy seed also be numbered arise walk through the land and the length of it in the breadth of it for I will give it unto thee last time Abraham had this right here it was down in the earth Caddy's when God spoke to him and that God God speaks to him when he comes into the land and God shows him the land this is the this is the next time that he has communication directly from God now he gets a sign from God as we said down there with a row where God's grace appears and does not allow Pharaoh to take Sarah his wife but yet right here God is letting it be known that now through this separation God's desire is for that separation and through that separation God Himself will make his word known further to Abraham not because he deserves it this is the glue of the Covenant sticking right here I wonder what if God did the way you and I did you've held out from Genesis 12 4 or 5 and you've been okay you went down into Egypt look at you and you kept locked expect me to talk to you now what have you done that's worthy of it this is where mercies need it not on our works not on our works if it was by our works listen friends we wouldn't have nothing to do even with one another that's the truth because we disappoint one another you would say a man I'll say a man for you we disappoint one another but yet here is the love of God His mercy moving down his mercy it's not saying I'm gonna tolerate this Abraham I'm just going to go along with it huh you're not pretend to didn't even happen no God is dealing with him he's bringing him along notice how faith itself you know faith has a way of displaying itself it displays itself it shows itself in works works according not according to the works of man but it is the works according to the divine promise abraham listen to me now abraham could have done a lot of good things here in genesis 13 he could have given lot the most joy slang lot you can have this plot you can have that man the moisture slain you'd say mine what a good guy but there had to be coupled with that separation because that was a work required by the word but in order for that work to be done see Abraham could have just done it but yet it had to be something to wear abraham was united with the promise of god and it was not something out of just i have to do it but it was out of love love out of what love to who love to the one who called him faith will display itself in works notice how that god when he he speaks here you find you find such a beautiful reality within Genesis 14 where Abraham himself here is he he goes after you know these kings five kings and and you know are these four kings they've overthrown the five and here Abraham arms his servants and he goes after them he doesn't even hesitate he doesn't think he doesn't stop and have prayer and fast about it but he goes right after it and it shows what authority that a man has when he's separated unto the gun to God when a man is separated various authority from God to act upon that word he didn't have to pray about it Abraham looked at it this is the land that God had given me by promise Lots part of that land I'm going out after him look at this his trained servants born in his house he armed him these servants go out they're born in his house they're armed with the whole armor of God they're going out into this battle as far as those kings in those armies they may more that mask Abraham but it's not about in number Abraham did not consider the number Abraham did not even consider what he was up against what was Abraham looking at this is God's Word what's happening mercy mercy in the Covenant has brought forth this part in Abraham's life that God knew was there the whole time and Abraham now is looking at a situation and instead of becoming so encompassed by what he sees he looks at what the promise that was made and he acts upon that promise my look at this the great campaign when he returns and how that God moves there and and visit and God visits him there you know here making himself known Melchizedek the priest and king of the Most High Most High God and he visits Abraham and and he blesses Abraham he who had the promises he blesses him and and notice Abraham even in the midst of this time Abraham is tempted he's tempted he's tempted to take riches of this world he's tempted to take riches for his service he's tempted to take earthly things but Abraham says I will not even take so much as a shoe lasted let's now have said thou has made Abraham rich he's been tested he's being tempted there's things that's alluring him and you know we can look at it Genesis that very part in Genesis 14 it brings it right down into our life can we be content with what God has given to us hey man can we be content I'll say there null in the natural I say it in the spiritual we don't you don't have to add anything to this message you do you hybridize it you don't have to add anything to it to make it glamorous or glorious God himself has vindicated it we don't have to bring back Nilson add this and add that God Himself gave a clear direction and a vindication he has included and given to us all that is necessary that's why the Prophet would ask the question are we sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst gonna need this God I need this I just say God perform your word because he performs his word than everything that he is everything that he has given and in accordance with his word he's there and he's there to use at his at his Liberty to minister to our lives everything is there healing deliverance all the gifts everything is better within him in the word my water what a reward you know God couldn't tell Abraham Abraham don't take that don't take that Abraham don't take that good god oh god was silence he allowed him to be tested what's gonna happen but Abraham by the grace of God remember how was he able to turn that down he realized the principle that he was living his life life was a principle that was not for self hello he did not think himself when he went after a lot he was not living for himself but how God comes on the scene in Genesis 15 1 and God rewards God rewards him the Bible says after these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision saying fear not Abram I am thy shield and by exceeding great reward let me tell you Abraham anointed were the promise of God going down there under that word there wasn't a king to Kentucky that wasn't a sword there wasn't a spear there wasn't an armed man that could have touched him you know they're after the commanding generals they're after the leaders are after those things after there wasn't one contention it wasn't that he was just walking along and saying my name is Abraham and my or Bruce and I know that but I'm trying to get a point across Abraham himself went down there by way of the word but it was not an act it was in faith to the word and faith demonstrated itself in the works that were shown there and Abraham as did the rest of his trained servants they fought in that's the same way when the Lord Jesus Christ Himself came to this earth a man he pursued the enemies even unto death and the Prophet said even unto Dan is the lowest parts of Hill he went to the lowest parts of Hill he paid the sin debt for you and I he was tempted he was tested in all points such as we have it wasn't an act when he had to turn his head it wasn't an act when he was tested it was a reality but it all overcame he overcame I am thy shield han - you know I'm your protection I am your buckler I am your strength and I am your reward not what the kings of this earth can give you I'm your reward I'm your reward a reward is that which is given for one who is faithful so God Himself by His mercy has to have been able to forget forgive all those things that Abraham has done and move on those remember he just can't come and do his word by duty it must be from his heart you said well the how in the world could Abraham's for his faults his failures and mistakes because when that word itself is made known that word coming to past is Christ its Christ that a standing Miriam that were for that word to be able to call out of Abraham's life to atone for his sins it was able to stand there and convict him and Abraham could repent let me tell you it does no good to bring conviction and reproof if there ain't no repentance there right but conviction and reprove it ought to lead to repentance because the goodness of God leadeth to repentance if Abraham would have walked around like many folks do without any conviction we wouldn't be reading about him today this one because of his flesh but it was God's faithfulness but there was a part within Abraham that could respond and be convicted oh brother Samuel ha was convicted long ago you need to be walking conviction every day of your life I'm not saying condemnation I said conviction when you walk in real godly conviction you watch the things you do you watch the things you say you watch the life that you live that's real godly conviction conviction is not just something under sanctification or under justification conviction is a part of our life all the way he believed God here God lets him know of what is to take place the word of the Lord came to Vinh verse 4 this shall not be thine heir but he that shall come forth not out of thine own bow that err and he brought him forth abroad and he looked now toward heaven told him to look toward heaven tell the Stars if thou be able to number them and he said so shall thy seed be and he believed in the Lord and he powdered it to him for righteousness watch this he believes what God has said and it's counted to him for righteousness if we could just pause for a moment we could ask the Lord Lord is Abraham fully where you want him to be no but yes he is no yes he is as far as in your eyesight no but in my eyesight a finished product I am bringing him to the image that I've known of him all along but Lord what about this and what about this what about that I know that but all that right there I'm chiseling away he makes us known to Abraham now watch what Abraham does Abraham so in tune with God here he he asks God what God desires to make known to him Oh in verse seven he said unto him I am the Lord that brought thee out of ur of Chaldees to give me this land to inherit it and he said Lord God whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it he's not doubting he believed God so in believing God he knows there's a fulfillment of that promise he knows that when God makes a word of promise God comes to confirm it God confirms his wireless signs and wonders following so he's asking for God to come and confirm that word that's just what God wanted him to do and here look at this how that Abraham i watch so what's how this is going on the mercy of God Abraham notice what's happening in this covenant Abraham is the mind of Christ though not fully dwelling in him yet but yet he's being drawn and you find him operating under the mind of Christ God tells him to lay out all of these sacrifices cut lay the sacrifices out and he opens them up the birds they were not to be divided but then all of a sudden here in verse 11 the Bible says fowls came down upon the carcasses and Abram drove them all he here is Abraham operating in tune with the mind of Almighty God what is this this is mercy Abraham recognizes if this right here that God is laying down to confirm the covenant there can't be one part missing it can't even be a peck see everything has got to be hearing must be the fullness in order to God to come and confirm it so Abraham God didn't telling me Abraham did something and surely the vultures but Abraham knew this right here God had told me to laid this out and the vultures were coming and he knew they would pick those things away but Abraham stood there and he shooed the vultures away what if he hadn't shooed the vultures away there would have been no confirming let me tell you something friends shooing the vultures away is not just for the stage of sanctification we can apply it very very very deeply and very clearly there but in each and every part of our life it's Satan that would like to take word away from us promises away from us but as the seed of Abraham we must stand there upon that word we're always standing on God's Word when there's something that tries to take away something that is our god-given right we have an authority surely the fowls I don't care who it is we have an authority you understand we're dealing with spirits these are the fowls of the air it was spirits shooing them away you realize if that had not been shoot away here in this hour there would not have been a token that would been a deliverer to you and I the token would not be delivered over a carcass that was worm hole eaten and looked like Swiss cheese but the only way is that that living Lord Jesus Christ the very fullness of himself it had to be him there had to be a call for the fullness and to believe that God is the same in every aspect in every part of his word his spinder on that where will is he doing driving away them fowls that spirits that were coming in religious spirits but he stood there to drive them away but you and I might enjoy the blessing and the promise that we have in Christ right now that was promised us but this was necessary he kept the fraud vultures away that's our God and trust us to keep the vultures away notice how that God comes along it makes the promise with him there in Genesis 15 lets him know that it's going to be an error out of your own bowels which we read but then here you come into the chapter of the women the chapter of sorry I and Hagar you come into a chapter here to where there's misunderstandings you come into a chapter here where self-will asserts itself you come into a place to where the Prophet would call it the great trial to where that Sarah herself would suggest to Abraham because in looking at her condition there's no way that III perhaps what God will do it might be that he'll give a seed through that of my handmaid she had no word to stand on but what's this this even shows look at the weakness that's here and here in the midst of this misunderstanding you realize that Ishmael himself was a misunderstanding that's why the Prophet could take us in 1964 look elated Jesus he said Abraham did not even look to the misunderstandings of the promise come on somebody there's a lot of things you can look at our misunderstandings of the promise but God is still God and the profit Center like this Abraham did not become focused on the misunderstandings Ishmael was a misunderstanding right but notice the mercy of God the mercy of God didn't take your smell say okay look you know Abraham because you all you know repented of it we'll just forget about it no Ishmael still afflicting to this day there's certain things that you could wish and say my wish I'd have never done that in my younger days there's certain things you would have never saw certain things you never partake off certain things you wish you never been around or this would happen or that would have happened why it still haunts and you look at it look at it even when God gets a hold of a life you take a lot than maybe it's been so lived within the world it's so hard and you can see the hardness upon a person's life from where they lived in the world one day when God gets ahold of their life you know all of a sudden change their skin and give them nice baby skin and take away all the hardness Scott doesn't do that but those things are reminders that grace has found you amen sometimes you look at situations in your life you look at failures you look at you look at scars but remember what scars are scars are not open wounds but scars are evidence that healing has come when I was wounded but now I am healed [Applause] every one of us in here there's things scars we wish we didn't have scars can sometimes be words that's been said he Vince that's happened you don't feel like you can even get beyond but I'll tell you there's a greater one there's a greater one than your memory and your ability here this morning there's one that not only forgives and forgets but there's one who can take the very steam of those words that were spoken you see friends sometimes these things when you look think about brother Brad talked about even sister Rosella you never said here sister Rosella beautiful complexion and beautiful skin Oh What did he say she looked at him and said I wish I looked like medium the hardness of her life that she had lived God didn't take that away sometimes seeds that are sown God don't take those seeds away mercy don't always take things away but sometimes there's things that remain that God can remind you if it wasn't for me you see he takes it to such a place for you and I can see there is no way but him it's not fathomable here not here but it's believable here but look how Sarah look what Sarah said in in in genesis 16:5 my lord Sarah in noticing what has taken place Sarah I said unto Abraham my wrong be upon thee not me thee my wrong it's her wrong but her own would be upon Abraham how can be mercy she's married God is looking at him and holding him responsible Sara notice how Sara opted God would have wiped her right out but it was her marriage her Union to Abraham and Abraham bore this sin if it would have been on her God would have removed her but that's the same way it is with you and I if it was not for our union with Jesus Christ our mistakes would put us right out but I'm not talking about living a defeated life I'm talking about when we're walking within this word but you and I are subject to mistakes but God's grace remains sufficient that ought to make you live more convicted that ought to make you live more thankful when you get that understanding it causes you to live with greater conviction and it's not about can't do this can't do that it's I love him more that's the kind of conviction I don't want to do anything that would displease him oh ma notice the Prophet says it like this I gotta read this pyrius in prayer in 1964 he said Lord forgiving our sins we pray that you'll not look at our misunderstandings our ignorance concerning the things that we should know that you'll forgive us for that and remember us just human beings father were subject to all kinds of mistakes and troubles thou art the infinite infallible everlasting God we pray that you'll be merciful to us and granted to us the blessings that we asked for for we ask it in Jesus name Amen your God makes known let me just just for time let me just move Genesis 17 here the mercy of God's moving how that God lets him know the Covenant that I'll make between you and me he lets it be known that in verse 17 verse 7 to 17 he said I'll establish my covenant between thee and thy seed after thee in the generations for an everlasting covenant to be a God unto the into thy seed after thee promises and there the the land were in your stranger verse 19 here God notice how God honing this in he's not deviating from the original revelation he's honing it in and God said Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed and thou shalt call his name Isaac and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant and with his seed after him and here think and look at the mercy of God after this is spoken Abraham laughs so she is of old age and me bear a son he laughs what held in that time he's not laughing at God but he's looking at his own his own self oh my can't be refined to other places look at this other places before we've already shown where Abraham's looking at the word he goes after a lot he takes a promise but see this is requiring a greater faith this isn't just believed God sent a prophet this is requiring a greater faith this is not just faith of well I'll be repenting my sins and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it's requiring a greater faith a greater faith is required so God how do we know we understand all moves upon the scene and he brings that that dissolving that leading to Abraham now notice here he comes and begins to talk to Abraham Sarah's in the tent you're familiar with this and how that that angel makes makes that declaration the angel the Lord standing there is God standing right there and making a declaration that at this time at the point of time in this year in the year Sarah I shall have a son what he spoke back there he's here to fulfill it it was a word there but notice how quick it came right quickly to the fulfillment and confirmation of that word he wasn't just gonna stay around as a word I hope you're hearing me now it wasn't just gonna stay around as a word and just rejoicing around the word but that word was spoken to become flesh thank God for the word but of all we're doing his washer been around a word and whoops have been around the ladder I'm telling you friend there won't be much there but it's worshiping around the living Lord Jesus Christ that's the word himself he points us to a living reality of confirmation of himself in his church to overbeat a car hallelujah oh no he didn't stop there when the seventh angel went off the scene he didn't stop that's the beginning I said that's the beginning there is not there's not gonna be another message coming now it's time for that message and that message is writing itself out in the hearts of the people the same Spirit of God the same angel the Lord that brought the word and delivered the word is the same age of the Lord leading the Church of the Living God what a comfort that is you didn't get in that you see you can worship around the word that's been given and miss what it's all about they were down there worshiping around the word that had been given and Paul found them and said have y'all heard had you heard that they're been here have you heard received the Holy Ghost I believe Dobson the prophet I said have you received the Holy Ghost I didn't ask if you could read I didn't ask if you could put it together I didn't ask if you can make sense I'm asking you has there been a change in your life have you been with entire or is it just acknowledgement of facts doctrines fountain look John's disciples John had disciples is that right they were gathered around that word John was trying to tell him you boys are missing it there's the Lamb of God is that right her brother Samuel they were walking right was the Lord not they they were not if they stayed with John to stay with John is to walk on with the word that came from John John the physical man would have been by the wayside but that word went on and that where had become flesh right there in the water it changed from the Prophet to his prophecy lorry be to God he meant Christ residing within the hearts of his people here's Sarah isn't she laughs how can this be she sees her condition how is this going to be look at me I'm old he's old both of us these things have ceased to be between us how is this going to be not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord how's this gonna happen he said I will Sarah laughs and God called her out on it oh my it seems to be the betting ground of the promise but you see the mercy of God held right there the mercy of God did not just say okay Sarah your unbelief will just bring it forward no he deals with it the mercy of God is there the word that has been given between Genesis 18 and when Isaac himself comes along there in Genesis 21 there has been a dissolving of all doubt then have to send another message the message that God came and vindicated himself the promise that was given God vindicated it and shearling under that vindication dissolved her doubt mercy I know this is simple oh it's so simple this morning but the reality of it is friends if it's not for the mercy of God the glue of the Covenant you and I would not make it our mistakes and everything as good as a good week as you can try to have yet it's all filthy rags in his sight because when you go to start trying to stack your goodness up before God as though that Lord I've done something good dad does not appease God whatsoever he looks for one thing and that's the blood tag do you have the life that token on this play because the token on display brings the desire in your life to the forefront and that faith declares itself in the works this is why God could have smote her here but she is identified in Abraham a brother brand could say like this he says when backsliding he said I wish somebody would have asked me a question on backsliding today he said there's no no way at all for you to keep out of it I know people can make these things and they give license you know I've had people stand and quote to me and said you know brother Samuel I can't help you no I drink you know everybody makes mistakes and I stand straight up and said that's a lie you can't help it if you got the Holy Ghost he is an overcomer you can't make excuses on the word and sometimes that don't make it you have friends or calls people to get mad at you but the thing about it is I'd rather you be mad at me now let me tell you the truth then standing there at the day of judgment and want to point a finger in my face I want to be honest with you because that's a real joy the real joy is the Holy Ghost that's the life of God but you backslide and he said you backslide to the people in the church but not before God you backslide on Christ but you don't because when you sin you're gone but you're constantly falling Paul had to die every day over the same I don't send your friends listen you realize this goes even to your attitude entertaining thoughts against people come on now let's dig a deep now but not when I'm not guilty dips and I'm not guilty this and I'm not guilty of this sounds like that woman brother ran was reaching on you know he's reaching out said you've reached a lot unbelief she's afraid God she's their brother an amen brother answer Wow you know I didn't even touch her they said her she the biggest gossip in the city and I'll mind you when the Prophet stood there in Toledo fruit buns cafeteria and here he was looking at this woman here she was in the condition he was in he was a recipient of mercy but he was not willing to extend it at that time so God had to have a conference with this prophet cuz his prophet will always recognize his word and that the prophet of the Holy Ghost is in you and you're born you'll recognize his word - he pulled him to the side and he began to show him the earth how it's covered with blood and every time of where he would send there was a bumper of blood brother rather quickly he repented of what his thoughts because he said right there I was criticizing her he said any of the eyes of God this is where it really gets down in the eyes of God I was just as bad as she was whoo you made a critical spirit as the same thing as a striptease same thing Oh glory no you can't classify sin sin is sin it's unbelief but that's why we need the mercy of God to wear when God would speak to our hearts and deal with arts quickly turn from that thing so God forgive me that is not becoming to me as a temple of the Holy Ghost for that to be there girl to be to God and God visited here look how God takes Abraham I'm closing here Genesis 22 yeah the climax of it God Abraham here think of what Abraham all did these chapters of where Abraham's been through Abraham has personally here he has been walking he's standing on the Word of God to bring him to where he's at in Genesis 22 what grace it's taken what mercy if not for mercy he would have been rode off way back there in Genesis 12 as a matter of fact it would have been before Genesis 12 he would have been rode off in Genesis 11 Genesis 11 yes because Genesis 12 once said the Lord had said the Lord had said God had spoke to him down there but he only made one little move to her own but the grace of God held mercy covenant mercy he sells him take that only son Isaac the one whom thou lovest get up into the land of Moriah and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee Abraham we know as he comes on in verse in verse 5 Abraham said unto his young men as they drew near he he saw the place and he tells the young men abide here with the ass and I am the lad will go yonder and worship and come again oh my Abraham what's Abraham standing on he's standing on God's Word it's not just where God has said take an offer up thy son but he's going here with faith in the word God made a promise that this son that I will give thee through Sarah will be your heir and I will establish my covenant with him and he had their seed throughout each generation he's standing upon that word here's this word Abraham acting in faith on that word he takes Isaac up there to the mountain he doesn't know he doesn't know that there's gonna be Iran there he doesn't know that he doesn't know how this change is gonna come about but he knows that God has told him where to go to so he's walking up there by faith Abraham had to have seen this by vision it had to be something that Abraham because the Bible said he seemed the place afar off it was a place that God had made known to him he reckoned this was the place God's talking about right here he's walking up there taking his only Son the love of his life the strength of his life his heir the one in whom the promise that God has made here's the one Abraham is being brought into such a declaration of complete obedience will it be everything will it be everything what was he showing that's exactly what the bridegroom would be oh the word walking in all the obedience to the word and all that the bridegroom is this bride is to walk in full obedience to the word not a part of the word but a full obedience Calvary listen Calvary was not just so that we could come and live you know good lives and have peace all for is listen those things are all wonderful but it's for redemption and not just redemption of the soul but redemption of the body it leads to a full reconciling all the way back home and here God uh ters out after Abraham he says God will provide for himself a lamb look is so in tune with God he'll provide for himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they went both together we see how that god of the angel of the Lord it called to Abraham to stay his hand but then in Genesis 22 and 20 25 22 15 and 16 he calls unto Abraham the second time and he said by myself have I sworn saith the Lord because thou has done this thing though it's not withheld thy son thine only son that in blessing I will bless thee and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the seashore and dies seed shall possess the gates of his enemies and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou hast obeyed my place that's what was happening the whole time Abraham was obeying his voice his word but ever as the word would continue to open it would require a greater faith but for a greater faith Abraham couldn't work yourself up into that God had to provide that so with that word that God was expressing God was also quickening that word to Abraham and that's why what we must have is that quickening the Lord the Spirit of God coming and quickening that word two hearts quickening into our hearts quickening it to arts this is this promise you and I are living by this promise right here this morning the seed it has come and it has possessed the gates of the enemy there was a necessary transaction at the gates and he met the transaction is that right we met the elders at the gate and there was a transaction at the gate he settled the transaction at the gate and the close he settled the transaction at the gate he told the Church of the Living God that the gates of Hell cannot prevail against it there's not a transaction of handle that can come against this church and because of that heroes on the Easter morning the gates of hell could not keep him the gates of the grave could not keep him the gates of death could not keep him and he arose and he led captivity captive and captivity captive being led up there they spoke and those that were there within the gates they said open up all ye everlasting gates and be ye open up who is this King of glory see they were able to say they were waiting in paradise for the transaction to be made but the transaction had been made they had been living for that transaction and here they were they arose there that morning it was not him that gave the direct does another hear the declaration is the Lord mighty in battle they said the Lord mighty in battle who is it that says he is Lord the Holy Ghost in you says he is Lord [Applause] he's the risen Christ in you Christ says I am the risen Christ so whatever whatever the need is the transaction has already what's needed has already been fulfilled in Christ all that we have to do is go to the gates with authority to receive and a juror Satan he must give transaction has been made for any promise of God in every promise of God the necessary transaction has already been made I'll say it this simple there are no excuse to walk out of here living below your privileges whatever your need is friends and I mean it because God knows how to speak to you personally and bring a need up before you in your life but just take that need and say I'm standing here with my token I'm standing here with my token the token that he has given me and I'm standing at the gate because the token speaks that the transaction has been fulfilled and he's there to back up that word you stand on that word and he's there to make that word alive and real to you not a word that you got to take from a preacher or anybody else God wants that word to be flesh in you to where it's pulsating like a stream of life through your life you're loving these are our promises not because we deserve them not because we're we're good because he's good because he's faithful and he clothes us by His mercy he'll called us to repent he directs us when we're wrong it's him that gives us a grace to live with a real genuine conviction not a conviction of fear but a conviction is says Lord that my walk be pleasing to you what I want my life to please you I love you I don't want to do anything Lord that would displease you in any way but I want my life to be a fulfillment of your life let's pray Heavenly Father Lord your word has been given this morning Lord dear God we just Lord we give ourselves to you Lord we know that father you have you have confirmed your word Lord as a minister as a preacher Lord I could stand your Lord under the inspiration and Lord speak Lord those things that Lord that you would place upon my heart and give to the Lord it takes you Lord to to further come Lord as we surrender to that and Lord for all that all of the needs and the desires Lord that your children have in you you made this so clear before us Lord God that you are our victory Lord that that victory the victory triumph Lord your victorious word it triumphs no doubt Lord Abraham many times would have been rode off Lord maybe we could have looked at Abraham said boy I don't think he's gonna make it but Lord God your mercy held and father as your prophet as he spoke to us and we read that Abraham was willing to repent when he was wrong lord I pray this morning that you would grant to every heart that's gathered here Lord father under my voice Lord that father if there would be anything that would be lacking in any life if there be any need Lord that is there and I believe there are needs here this morning Lord I believe that Lord and I'm asking God that father as we can be as sincere Lord God as we can be and we ask you to help us be more sincere Lord that father that the promises Lord that you are are calling us to Lord that father that we might walk with a greater faith Lord a greater conviction Lord oh dear God a greater assurance lord I pray that father that you will just lord have your way Lord to minister Lord to the needs of your people Lord let there not be one Lord that father though though you would have spoke to him Lord they might look at things and say well I went down to Egypt and I've so turned but Lord may they recognize this morning Lord that grace holds for them that Lord all they have to do they have to repent Lord not just words but father as that that breaking up that reproving their Lord in their heart Lord where they're broke up Lord may they turn to you Lord and say father I want to walk on with you Lord I want to move on I want to move deeper in you Lord God I I don't want to just Lord and lay around more the confines of a church Lord ER or just to be associated Lord around the message but lord I I want to move into you lord I I want that depth of walk Lord in you Father and I pray that God that you'll grant that Lord father for every Lord and I prayed through God this morning that you just Lord as your word was coming this morning and Lord just feeling so moved and pressed Lord of how that mercy itself Lord like the glue of the Covenant Lord holding for us Lord to lead us in the guidance Lord when we have Lord erred when we went wrong even within our faults Lord as things that you are pointing out today our feelings Lord attitudes sometimes Lord a lack of forgiveness Lord all of those things Lord it just Lord it comes all around to one thing Lord of sin and we just ask God that Lord here this morning that father may we Lord take Lord and hear of that word and and the things that you've dealt with the song Lord may we Lord stand there Lord at the gates this morning Lord and may we confess our sins Lord God father Lord to know that you are faithful and just to forgive us Lord and father the reason why would I Ibrahim confess that why would Abraham turn from that because of the promise that you had given him and that's why I Lord our life then why why we confess why the Lord repentance the Lord would be extended to us Lord why that would would we repent Lord it's because Lord God of your grace and your love the Lord would wrap around our hearts to draw us to you Lord how we thank you this morning I pray that God that you'll just Lord take your word put it together in every heart Lord father you know how to bring it all together make it Lord so
