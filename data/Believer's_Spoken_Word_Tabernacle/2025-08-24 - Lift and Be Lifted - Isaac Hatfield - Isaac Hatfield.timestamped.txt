[17:29] and I struggle
[17:31] now and then.
[17:34] But victory
[17:36] with Jesus
[17:39] is always so sweet.
[17:45] If I could go to the places
[17:50] I've already
[17:53] been,
[17:54] I would do it
[17:57] all over
[17:59] again.

[18:08] &gt;&gt; that he's brought me through.
[18:12] climb each mountain
[18:15] I've already
[18:17] climbed.
[18:21] Every step I have traveled, he's been
[18:26] faithful
[18:28] and true.
[18:32] So I'll walk them
[18:35] again by his side.
[18:41] every moment,
[18:43] every mountain,
[18:45] every mile.
[18:49] And many times there was a struggle,
[18:54] trusting what I could not see.
[18:58] But each time
[19:00] he worked all things for my good.
[19:07] So I would walk by his side through
[19:12] every triumph and trial.
[19:18] Every moment,
[19:21] every mountain,
[19:23] every mile
[19:27] I would face every moment
[19:31] that he's brought me through.
[19:35] I'd climb each mountain
[19:38] I've already
[19:41] climbed.
[19:44] Every step I have traveled,
[19:49] he's been faithful and true.
[19:55] So I'll walk them again by his side.
[20:02] [Music]
[20:03] Every moment,
[20:06] every mountain,
[20:08] every mile,
[20:12] every step I have traveled,
[20:16] he's been faithful and true.
[20:24] So I'd walk them
[20:27] again by his side.
[20:33] Every moment,
[20:35] every mountain,
[20:37] every mile,
[20:44] every moment.
[20:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:46] &gt;&gt; Every mountain,
[20:49] every mile.

[21:26] And I don't regret
[21:30] one time.
[21:33] I've trusted
[21:36] in his word.
[21:39] And I've seen the years go by.
[21:46] Many days without
[21:52] Oh, but I don't regret
[21:56] a mile.
[21:59] I've traveled
[22:02] for a special. Sister Bethy's got a
[22:05] special for us this morning as well.
[22:06] Bless us with a special. So, let's just
[22:08] sing this one more time. She comes.
[22:10] Lord, I don't regret a mile.

[22:22] and I don't regret
[22:26] one time

[22:32] in his word.
[22:35] Well, I've seen
[22:38] the years go by
[22:42] many days
[22:44] without
[22:46] a song.
[22:49] But I don't regret
[22:52] a not one mile that I've traveled
[22:58] for.
[23:00] [Music]

[24:08] like year, year and a half, um, I was
[24:10] dealing with some real like health
[24:12] issues and, um, and they just kind of

[24:17] this song kind of at the beginning of
[24:19] when it all started. And now, you know,
[24:22] when I sing it, it just has a whole new
[24:23] meaning. And I've I've met him in this
[24:25] way now. And and if you're sick or

[36:47] &gt;&gt; All my life you have been so so good.
[36:56] Every breath
[36:58] I am able.
[37:01] [Music]
[37:03] I will sing
[37:06] of the goodness
[37:08] of God.
[37:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, amen. I will sing
[37:14] of the goodness
[37:17] of God.
[37:19] Oh, can you praise him this morning?
[37:22] Amen. Has he been good to you?
[37:25] Amen. He brought you through another
[37:26] week. Amen. He's kept you. Amen. and
[37:30] he's brought you out of this world to
[37:32] serve him and believe. Amen. The word
[37:34] for your hour. He's been so good to us.
[37:36] Amen. He's healed our bodies. He's saved
[37:39] our souls. And we're so thankful this
[37:42] morning to serve a living God. Amen.
[37:45] Amen. It's just so good to be with you.
[37:47] Amen. We just love this assembly so
[37:49] much. We love your pastor, Brother
[37:51] Samuel, and just trusting the Lord's
[37:53] blessing them there this weekend where
[37:55] they're at. and just appreciate his
[37:57] confidence to have us be here this
[37:59] morning. We just pray the Lord give us
[38:02] grace. Amen. As we approach his word.
[38:05] Amen. And so if you have your Bibles,
[38:08] Amen. We'll just go straight to the word
[38:09] and turn to the book of Numbers, chapter
[38:12] 21. And Amen. It's good to have family
[38:16] here this morning.
[38:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. We got to spend some time with the
[38:21] Hannah family. And I'm sure, of course,
[38:24] we love Brother Brian, Sister Gracie,
[38:26] our our family, and uh my wife got to be
[38:30] here this morning with our little boy.
[38:32] And so, our hearts are full this morning
[38:35] for what the Lord has done. Amen. Has he
[38:37] brought you out of something? Amen. Have
[38:40] you ever been in a dark pit and the Lord
[38:42] lifted you out? Amen. It'll put a song
[38:45] in your heart. Amen. to know where he's
[38:48] neither is there any water and our soul
[38:49] loathth this light bread and the Lord
[38:52] sent fiery serpents among the people and
[38:54] they bit the people and much people of
[38:56] Israel died therefore the Lord came to
[38:59] Moses and said we have sinned for we
[39:01] have spoken against the Lord and against
[39:03] thee pray unto the Lord that he take
[39:05] away the serpents from us and Moses
[39:08] prayed for the people and the Lord said
[39:10] unto Moses make thee a fiery serpent and
[39:13] set it upon a pole and it shall come to
[39:15] pass that everyone that is bitten when
[39:17] he lookth upon it shall live. And Moses
[39:19] made a serpent of brass and put it upon
[39:21] a pole. And it came to pass that if a
[39:23] serpent had bitten any man when he
[39:26] beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.
[39:28] And we'll go to the book of John. Couple
[39:31] quick places here in John 3. And you
[39:34] don't have to turn there if you don't
[39:35] want to, but we're going to read out of
[39:37] the 12th verse here. says, "If I have
[39:39] told you earthly things and you believe
[39:41] not, how shall you believe if I tell you
[39:43] of heavenly things, and no man hath
[39:46] ascended up to heaven, but he that came
[39:48] down from heaven, even the Son of Man
[39:52] which is in heaven." And as Moses lifted
[39:54] up the serpent in the wilderness, even
[39:56] so must the Son of Man be lifted up,
[39:58] that whosoever believeth in him should
[40:00] not perish, but have everlasting have
[40:03] eternal life. For God so loved the world
[40:05] that he gave his only begotten son that
[40:07] whosoever believeth in him should not
[40:08] perish but have everlasting life. In
[40:12] John 12 just a few pages over in the
[40:14] 27th verse
[40:18] it reads now is my soul troubled and
[40:20] what shall I say? Father save me from
[40:23] this hour before this cause came I unto
[40:27] this hour. Father glorify thy name. And
[40:30] then there came a voice from heaven
[40:31] saying, "I have both glorified it and
[40:33] will glorify it again." The people
[40:36] therefore that stood by and heard it
[40:37] said that it thundered. And others said,
[40:39] "An angel spake to him." Jesus answered
[40:42] and said, "This voice came not because
[40:43] of me, but for your sakes. Now is the
[40:46] judgment of this world. Now shall the
[40:48] princes of this world be cast out, and
[40:51] I, if I be lifted up from the earth,
[40:54] will draw all men unto me." This he
[40:56] said, signifying what death he should
[40:58] die. And the people answered him, "We
[41:00] have heard out of the law that Christ
[41:02] abideth forever. And how sayest thou the
[41:04] Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is the
[41:08] Son of Man?" Then Jesus said unto them,
[41:10] "Yet a little while is the light with
[41:12] you. Walk while you have the light, lest
[41:14] darkness come upon you. For he that
[41:15] walketh in darkness, knoweth not whether
[41:18] he goeth. While you have light, believe
[41:20] in the light, that you may be the
[41:21] children of light." These things spake
[41:24] Jesus and departed and did hide himself
[41:26] from them. Amen. And if we could just
[41:28] bow our heads real quick for a word of
[41:30] prayer.
[41:32] And if you have a need, just lift it
[41:34] before the Lord. Heavenly Father, we
[41:36] just want to come before you this
[41:38] morning, Lord. And we just want to say
[41:40] how we love you, Father. We just want to
[41:42] say how we thank you, Lord, for what
[41:45] you've done in our lives, Lord. You've
[41:47] brought us through so much, Father.
[41:49] You've kept us in hours of of testings
[41:52] and trials. Father, you've kept us in
[41:54] hours of sickness. You've kept us in
[41:57] hours of bondage, Father. Lord, and
[41:59] you've brought us here this morning,
[42:01] Lord. And you brought us through many
[42:03] battles, Father. And Lord, we're here to
[42:06] testify that you're a mighty God, Lord.
[42:08] And that you're the same yesterday,
[42:10] today, and forever. And all things are
[42:11] possible with you this morning, Lord.
[42:14] So, we invite you to come into this
[42:15] meeting, Lord, to pick up these words
[42:18] which we've studied, Father, and inspire
[42:20] them and quicken them to our hearts, I
[42:22] pray, as we fellowship with you. and
[42:24] we'll be sure to give you the glory in
[42:26] Jesus name. Amen. You may have your
[42:29] seats this morning.
[42:33] Amen.
[42:35] If we could just take a little text out
[42:37] of that. We're kind of staying in our
[42:40] Exodus study a little bit, but we jumped
[42:43] over to Numbers. So, but we're in that
[42:45] same channel of thought. And so, we'd
[42:47] like to speak out of that this morning
[42:50] on lift and be lifted. Lift and be
[42:53] lifted. And we find that the children of
[42:55] Israel were on their journey. The Lord
[42:58] had brought them through the Red Sea.
[42:59] The Lord had done mighty works amongst
[43:02] them. And they were constantly
[43:04] complaining. They were constantly
[43:06] murmuring. They were constantly always
[43:08] brother Paul looking for something to
[43:11] nickpit and and say my they were always
[43:14] comparing their journey with what they
[43:16] had in Egypt and saying this isn't the
[43:18] same. We had better food. Amen. We don't
[43:21] like this mana. We don't like that. that
[43:23] we don't have a constant source of
[43:25] water. We don't like these things.
[43:27] Constantly complaining. Amen. When when
[43:29] when they were feeding from heavenly
[43:31] mana when God would water them out of
[43:34] that rock in the wilderness and they
[43:35] were always finding something to
[43:37] complain and murmur after. And so they
[43:40] were uh would be released snakes that
[43:42] would come and bite them as a judgment
[43:44] for their murmuring and they're
[43:45] complaining against God and against his
[43:47] prophet. Amen. And brother Brandham said
[43:50] in this day that would be like saying,
[43:51] "Well, why do we have to go to church
[43:53] every Wednesday or Thursday? Why do we
[43:55] have to go to church every Sunday?"
[43:57] Constantly finding something to murmur
[44:00] about and complain about and say, "Well,
[44:02] it was better in in in this place. It
[44:04] was better in in this city. It was
[44:06] better, you know, when I used to be out
[44:08] in the world." and you're always looking
[44:10] back and and so we don't want to have
[44:12] that attitude of murmuring and
[44:13] complaining or else that's how you can
[44:16] get snake bit and a little bite of
[44:18] jealousy or a little bite of uh
[44:20] bitterness will get you. A little bite
[44:21] of of you know anger and hatred will
[44:25] begin to slip in in those moments of
[44:27] murmuring and complaining. Amen. So we
[44:30] want to be thankful. Amen. And we want
[44:32] to look to the one that's leading us
[44:34] because when they murmured and sinned,
[44:36] Amen. And it it it brought them into a
[44:39] condition where I mean they were at the
[44:41] door of death. They were they were
[44:43] complaining. They were sinning and they
[44:45] were sick. It was they were they were
[44:47] they were struggling on both fronts if
[44:49] we could say it. They were both sinick
[44:51] and sick in their body because those
[44:53] snakes and had bit them. And and when
[44:56] those snakes bit them, they had
[44:57] physicians in the land. Brother Brandon
[44:59] would say, but he said they didn't have
[45:01] a physician for that bite. Amen. They
[45:04] they might have had, I mean, a a certain
[45:07] qualified uh doctor for a certain thing
[45:10] and this and that, but nobody nobody was
[45:12] there to that was qualified to treat
[45:15] that snake bite because that snake bite
[45:17] represents sin and death that would
[45:20] bite, amen, this world. Amen. And
[45:22] nothing could treat it, amen, except
[45:24] Jesus Christ. Amen. A a and we have
[45:27] psychologists and we have amen church
[45:30] lodges and we have amen all these
[45:32] programs and 10step plans and those
[45:34] those are okay but they're not going to
[45:36] treat that sin bite amen of death that
[45:40] come in the garden of Eden Amen and put
[45:42] its mark upon this world amen that we
[45:45] would be born in sin and shaped in
[45:47] iniquity and come into the world
[45:49] speaking lies amen because that serpent
[45:51] the devil amen he has had his trail
[45:54] throughout the Bible where He's tried to
[45:56] destroy sons and daughters of God. Amen.
[45:59] And he got into that seed of the
[46:01] serpent. Amen. When he come through Eve.
[46:03] And since then, he's had a dominion over
[46:06] this world. Is that right? He's the god
[46:09] of this evil age. Amen. This is Satan's
[46:11] Eden that we're living in in our natural
[46:14] flesh because, Amen. Of what happened,
[46:17] Amen. in the Garden of Eden where he put
[46:20] his his fang marks upon this world.
[46:22] Amen. And now he's constantly trying to
[46:25] bite us, amen, with sickness and
[46:28] constantly trying to bite us with sin
[46:30] and constantly trying to bite us, amen,
[46:32] with with false doctrines. And any way
[46:35] that he can get his venom into the
[46:37] children of man, amen, he'll do it. He's
[46:40] not a respector of persons. Amen. But
[46:43] his mark has been put upon the people in
[46:46] this hour. Amen. But God, rich in mercy,
[46:49] said, "I will not leave you in that
[46:52] condition." Amen. But I will raise up a
[46:55] brass serpent which will be a symbol
[46:57] unto you. Amen. That you don't have to
[46:59] stay where you're at. He said you're
[47:01] guilty. Amen. You're absolutely guilty
[47:04] of murmuring and complaining. Amen. And
[47:07] you're unlawful people. Amen. But you're
[47:10] a circumcised people. And I will make a
[47:12] way. Amen. That you might escape from
[47:14] your Amen. Your death penalty. That you
[47:16] might escape. Amen. From your sickness
[47:18] and from your sin. And I will raise up a
[47:20] brass serpent. Amen.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; Oh my. So Moses began to construct it
[47:25] out of uh maybe a mosquite tree and he
[47:27] said maybe brass from the helmets of the
[47:30] Romans or something that they had won in
[47:32] battle. And he begins to put it together
[47:35] as an end sign that they might look to
[47:37] it. And and it's been prophesied in
[47:40] Isaiah 5 that an end sign would be
[47:42] lifted up. And brother Brandham taught
[47:44] us an end sign is something that you
[47:47] look to. It's a commemoration like like
[47:49] a flag that you look to to say that
[47:51] we've won and this belongs to us and
[47:54] this is ours and uh an end sign was
[47:57] lifted up in Noah's day as an ark and it
[48:00] was lifted up in Moses ministry as a rod
[48:02] in his hand. I mean, but you see that
[48:04] ends sign travels throughout the Bible
[48:06] because it doesn't just stay in one spot
[48:09] because it's all pointing to the perfect
[48:11] end sign Jesus that would be raised on
[48:14] the cross. Amen. So, it's only types.
[48:17] Amen. But it was lifted up as a type,
[48:19] amen, in the wilderness with the
[48:21] children of Israel that they might look
[48:23] to the end sign and they might live.
[48:26] Amen. They didn't have to, amen, dig in
[48:29] their pockets and fork out any money,
[48:31] brother Dave. They didn't have to, amen,
[48:33] get on their knees and a a and do some
[48:35] sort of penance or mean enter into some
[48:38] sort of limbo or purgatory. I mean, they
[48:40] didn't have to mean they didn't have to
[48:42] put their name on a book or shake a
[48:43] hand. The only thing they had to do was
[48:46] look to the symbol on the on the cross
[48:49] and live. Amen. Only look and live.
[48:52] Amen. Amen. I I like what our brother
[48:54] Brian pointed you to when you were
[48:56] reading prayer requests. That's Amen. a
[48:58] perfect example of what Moses was doing,
[49:00] saying, "Look and live." He's saying, "I
[49:03] know you've made mistakes. I know you've
[49:04] had failures." Amen. You don't have to
[49:06] sit here day and night and worry about
[49:09] how you're going to fix it and how
[49:10] you're going to pay for it and what
[49:12] you're going to do to fix your mistakes
[49:14] and fix your family heritage. He said,
[49:16] "Don't worry about any of that. Just
[49:18] look, Amen. and live. Just look to just
[49:21] look to the symbol of atonement. Oh, and
[49:24] be resurrected from your struggle."
[49:27] Amen. But but but it matters how you
[49:29] look
[49:31] &gt;&gt; because because brother Brandham said
[49:33] some of them wouldn't look at all and
[49:35] they wouldn't receive anything and some
[49:36] of them would only look onto it as being
[49:38] an idol and they wouldn't receive the
[49:41] benefit because they didn't look right.
[49:43] But brother Brandham said when the true
[49:45] believer come out there and looked upon
[49:46] that serpent with spiritual revealed
[49:49] truth and mean that serpent being it was
[49:51] in the form of a serpent it represented
[49:54] sin already judged. Amen. That serpent
[49:57] was a symbol that God was in the camp.
[50:00] Amen. But if they only looked upon it as
[50:02] an idol, they wouldn't receive the
[50:04] benefit from it. Amen. But if they
[50:07] looked with spiritual revelation, they
[50:09] would see that that represented that
[50:11] that serpent. Amen. From the garden,
[50:14] Amen. that was judged in the garden.
[50:16] Amen. It was showing that sin is already
[50:19] been judged. Amen. Your mistakes have
[50:22] already been judged. Now, now the
[50:25] fundamentalists, brother Brandham would
[50:27] say, you know, they might have walked
[50:28] out and and they wouldn't they would
[50:30] look upon it and say that this was never
[50:32] spoken of in scripture. Brother Brandham
[50:35] said God can do things sometimes that
[50:37] aren't even spoken of in scripture. I if
[50:40] you're looking fundamentally, I mean,
[50:42] but the true believer can read between
[50:44] the lines with with revelation, amen,
[50:47] and see the mind of God that he's
[50:49] setting a type. Amen. But the
[50:51] fundamental says, "Oh, I I've studied
[50:54] the scrolls from front to back. I never
[50:56] seen this." Amen. This is fanaticism.
[50:58] This is just idol worship. And they
[51:00] missed the blessing. Amen. That was
[51:02] laying right before them. Amen. Just
[51:04] like they missed Jesus when he came.
[51:06] Just like they missed brother Brandham.
[51:08] Amen. Because they looked at it through
[51:10] fundamental eyes without spiritual
[51:13] revelation. But when the believer walks
[51:15] out and looks upon that symbol, he says,
[51:18] "That is my atonement. That is the
[51:20] judgment of my sin. That is my
[51:22] breakthrough into health. That's my
[51:24] breakthrough into deliverance. That's my
[51:26] breakthrough into joy and peace this
[51:28] morning. Amen. Because you're looking,
[51:30] Amen. different than the unbeliever
[51:32] looks. Brother Brandham said they'll
[51:34] come in the prayer lines. He said if
[51:36] they just look upon this as being
[51:38] Belzeub, they'll get Beelzebub's reward.
[51:41] But if they look upon this as Christ,
[51:43] then they'll get Christ's reward. Amen.
[51:46] You access the blessings of God through
[51:48] your approach to God. Amen. Wasn't that
[51:51] how blind Barameus accessed him when he
[51:54] called him, "Thou son of David, have
[51:56] mercy upon me." Amen. But when the
[51:59] serenician woman tried that, it wouldn't
[52:01] work until she called him Lord. Amen.
[52:04] Because that was his, amen, her approach
[52:07] through revelation. Amen. To the
[52:09] promises of God. Amen. And it matters
[52:12] how you approach the promises. It
[52:15] matters how you look. Amen. Because if
[52:17] you're looking at the promises in this
[52:19] Bible as something you have to earn or
[52:22] something you have to attain or the Holy
[52:24] Ghost is something you got to pound out
[52:26] of an altar, amen, you're going to live
[52:28] a very frustrated and discouraged life.
[52:31] But if you look upon the promises, amen,
[52:33] that Jesus paid for them at Calvary and
[52:36] the bloodbought promises belong to you
[52:38] and you have a right to purchase every
[52:40] promise of God. When you start looking
[52:43] that way, amen, it'll open up a whole
[52:45] new world to you. And you'll say, "Amen,
[52:46] it's my right. It's my inheritance.
[52:49] Healing is mine. Deliverance is mine.
[52:52] Oh, salvation is mine. My If you just
[52:57] come to church this morning and all
[52:59] you're looking at is a man up here
[53:00] spitting, amen, and sweating, amen, and
[53:03] a and you come every Sunday and you just
[53:06] see brother Samuel and you just sit
[53:08] there and say, "Well, well, well, preach
[53:10] me happy." or or impress me. Amen. If
[53:13] all you see is the four walls, if if all
[53:15] you see is the church trouble and the
[53:17] the struggles and the heartaches. Amen.
[53:19] You'll go back out the door the same way
[53:21] that you came in. But you say, "Lord,
[53:24] change the way I look." And you'll walk
[53:26] through those doors and you'll say, "The
[53:27] angel of the Lord accompanies the
[53:30] message always." And he's here this
[53:32] morning to meet my need. And the angels
[53:34] are encamped round about those that fear
[53:36] him. Oh, if God could give us eyes to
[53:38] look, I believe the pillar of fire is in
[53:40] the building this morning. Angels are
[53:42] surrounding you where you're sitting.
[53:44] Amen. And the voice of God still speaks
[53:46] through the five-fold ministry. Amen. If
[53:48] you take the veil off and you begin to
[53:50] look the way God intended you to look,
[53:53] you'll see a supernatural possibility
[53:55] this morning for God to come down and
[53:58] meet your need in a very personal way.
[54:00] Amen. You got to get your eyes off the
[54:02] struggle. You got to get your eyes off
[54:04] the man. That's why when people look at
[54:06] this message, amen, they walk away
[54:08] because all they ever saw was the
[54:10] mistakes. All they ever saw was the man.
[54:13] All they ever saw was this and that.
[54:15] Amen. But they never looked through
[54:16] revelation long enough to see that this
[54:19] is the revealing of the son of man. This
[54:21] is the coming of the Lord. Amen. But if
[54:24] they ever met that dissolver of doubts,
[54:26] oh, he would lead them through the
[54:28] scriptures and show them this message is
[54:30] nothing but the truth. Oh, but they
[54:33] don't take the time to look and that's
[54:35] all they ever see. Amen. But I I I I I
[54:39] like how Peter had to do it on Mount
[54:42] Transfiguration
[54:44] when God was adopting his son and
[54:46] lifting him up on a holy a holy God was
[54:49] there on the mountain and he was
[54:52] adopting him and there was Peter, James,
[54:54] and John. Amen. And there was Moses,
[54:56] Elijah, and Jesus. And God was adopting
[54:59] his son. And it was a supernatural
[55:01] moment. And Peter said, "Oh Lord, let us
[55:03] build three tabernacles. One for Moses,
[55:07] one for Elijah, and one for you, Lord."
[55:09] Amen. But Brother Bam showed us that
[55:11] Moses represented the law. And the law
[55:14] was a policeman that would only put you
[55:16] in jail. And and Elijah represented
[55:19] justice. And he said, "I don't want
[55:20] God's justice. I want God's mercy." Oh.
[55:24] But in a moment, amen, a voice spoke out
[55:26] and said, "This is my beloved son, and
[55:29] who I am well pleased. Hear ye him." And
[55:32] Peter looked again. And when he looked,
[55:34] he saw Jesus only. Amen. That's how you
[55:37] got to look at this message. Some people
[55:39] look and all they see is a bunch of
[55:40] rules and regulations. All they see is a
[55:42] bunch of justice and judgment, and
[55:45] tribulation. Amen. But look again, and
[55:47] you'll see Jesus only. Amen. Christ has
[55:50] descended. Get your eyes off of the law.
[55:53] Get your eyes off of the justice and
[55:55] look oh to Jesus only. Salvation this
[55:59] morning comes through Jesus only. It's
[56:01] not Jesus plus your works. It's not
[56:03] Jesus plus your goodness. It's not Jesus
[56:06] plus Amen. how many times you read your
[56:08] Bible a day, how many hours you spend in
[56:10] prayer. It is only through the blood of
[56:13] Jesus that we look this morning and find
[56:16] our salvation. Oh my. Look and see Jesus
[56:20] only. Amen. And that's why people
[56:24] criticize the way we worship and the way
[56:26] we shout. I mean, because when they
[56:28] look, all they see is a bunch of holy
[56:30] rollers. All they see is a bunch of
[56:32] Pentecostals.
[56:33] Amen. But brother man said, "You better
[56:35] be careful calling someone a holy roller
[56:38] that's doing what you should be doing."
[56:40] Amen. He said, "And if the name of
[56:42] Pentecost offends you," Amen. If the
[56:44] name of Pentecost will dampen your
[56:46] spirit, he said, "That kind of spirit
[56:48] ought to be dampened." Amen. because
[56:50] they're looking through the veil of a a
[56:53] of a a tradition or through a
[56:54] denomination and they don't see that
[56:57] it's the living God in our midst. Oh,
[57:00] but you say, "Why do you worship,
[57:01] Brother Isaac?" Because I looked like
[57:04] David looked and I see more than an
[57:07] emotion. I see the word returning into
[57:10] our midst and it's putting me in the
[57:12] spirit because this is what the believer
[57:14] has looked for for thousands of years.
[57:16] And we see it, Brother Brian. The word
[57:19] has returned back into this age and it
[57:21] puts us into a dance like it made David
[57:23] dance. I see like Peter looked and said,
[57:26] "This is that which was spoken of by the
[57:28] prophet Joel. I will restore saith the
[57:31] Lord. I look like Miam looked and the
[57:34] task masters which once tried to plague
[57:36] my life are dead in the sea behind me."
[57:39] That's why we worship. That's why we
[57:41] dance. We are looking into an unseen
[57:43] realm. Amen. Brother Brandham said at
[57:46] the pool of Bethesda, they said it's
[57:48] just the wind causing the waters to
[57:50] blow. But he said, "Not to them. To
[57:52] them, it was an angel of mercy troubling
[57:54] the water." Oh my. Brother Brandham told
[57:58] a doctor one time, he said, "Sure, in
[58:01] one sense, they're excited, but can you
[58:03] just can you excite your nerve by
[58:05] yourself?" No, it takes something to
[58:06] excite that nerve. And he said, "It's
[58:08] that Holy Spirit coming amongst us and
[58:11] then feeding us and giving us eternal
[58:13] life." Oh, but if you don't if you don't
[58:17] take time to look, you'll never see it.
[58:19] And you'll criticize it and speak
[58:21] against the move of God. Oh, but if
[58:24] you've ever broke through that veil,
[58:25] you'll never criticize it. You'll never
[58:27] you'll you'll see it for what it is.
[58:30] Amen.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandt said that man preaching
[58:32] the social gospel will stand on the
[58:34] outside of the door and look in and call
[58:36] it a bunch of holy rollers. But he said
[58:39] that man and ever once breaks through
[58:41] that veil said you'll never call them
[58:43] holy rollers no more.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; It's a veil over the eyes not allowing
[58:49] them to look a way.
[58:53] And that's why we say God take the veil
[58:56] from off of my eyes.
[58:59] Amen. I don't want to look at my brother
[59:01] and sister and just see mistakes and
[59:04] failures and faults. I don't want to
[59:06] look and see squables and fightings and
[59:08] hurt. Amen. Because what difference does
[59:11] it make? Amen. We're all going to die
[59:13] one day and God's given us a life here
[59:16] together. Amen. Where we can fellowship.
[59:19] Amen. Not have the attitude of if I can
[59:21] just get even. If I can just get even
[59:23] with this one. If if I can just have the
[59:25] last say. Brother Brand said, "Choose
[59:27] life."
[59:29] He said, "Choose life. For if we
[59:31] wouldn't forgive our brother, how much
[59:33] more would the heavenly father not
[59:35] forgive us?" Amen. We don't want to hold
[59:37] a knot. We don't want to look through
[59:38] that lens. We want to look through the
[59:41] lens of the blood. Amen. We want to look
[59:44] through the lens of the word. We want to
[59:47] look through eyes of understanding
[59:50] because we've been given another set of
[59:52] eyes. You know, brother Brandham taught
[59:53] us that seeing is understanding. Amen.
[59:57] Amen. He said, "Some people say that
[59:59] seeing is believing." He said, "No,
[1:00:02] that's not right. Understanding is
[1:00:04] believing." Because the Bible said,
[1:00:05] "Except a man be born again, how shall
[1:00:08] he see or understand the kingdom of
[1:00:11] God." So, we've been given not a natural
[1:00:14] eye to look and believe with, but we've
[1:00:16] been given a spiritual eye, the six
[1:00:18] sense,
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; faith, and in a spiritual sense to look
[1:00:23] past the natural senses. Amen. and see
[1:00:25] with eyes of understanding. Uh uh that's
[1:00:28] how Moses looked through the same window
[1:00:30] that Pharaoh looked through. Amen.
[1:00:32] Because by faith Moses saw the children
[1:00:35] of Israel and esteemed the reproach of
[1:00:38] those children greater than the glories
[1:00:40] of Pharaoh and the glories of Egypt. By
[1:00:43] faith he looked out the same window.
[1:00:45] Amen. But he saw differently than
[1:00:47] Pharaoh. Amen. He saw a group that he
[1:00:49] wanted to become a part of. Amen.
[1:00:52] Brother Brandham speaks about John Ryan
[1:00:54] who was blind. You all know the
[1:00:56] testimony. And he began to testify of
[1:00:58] his healing. And they were ready to
[1:01:00] throw him in an insane asylum because
[1:01:03] they thought he was crazy. Amen. For
[1:01:05] testifying when his eyes were closed
[1:01:07] shut. But brother Brandham said he's
[1:01:09] seeing with another sight. Amen. Amen.
[1:01:12] We've been given another sight that we
[1:01:14] might look through. Amen. That we might
[1:01:16] see the promise. Amen. The Bible said
[1:01:18] that they would have eyes and see not
[1:01:21] and ears and hear not. But in Ephesians
[1:01:24] 1:18, it says, "The eyes of your
[1:01:26] understanding being enlightened." Amen.
[1:01:30] So, it's possible that you could have
[1:01:31] eyes and see not. But the more important
[1:01:34] thing is that the eyes of your
[1:01:36] understanding would be enlightened that
[1:01:38] you might see with another sight the
[1:01:41] promises of God. And that happens when
[1:01:43] you're born again. Brother Brand said
[1:01:45] that new birth makes you a candidate for
[1:01:48] association with the unseen realm. Amen.
[1:01:51] And when you receive that new birth, you
[1:01:53] become a two-fold being and mean. One in
[1:01:55] the natural and one in the spiritual.
[1:01:58] And mean that you could look through the
[1:02:00] eyes of understanding. And this morning,
[1:02:02] if you come looking through the eyes of
[1:02:04] the natural man, I mean, you say, "I
[1:02:06] understand that there's a lot of
[1:02:08] struggles. I I understand there's a lot
[1:02:10] of heartaches. I understand that it
[1:02:12] doesn't look very good." But you
[1:02:14] understand by the onseen that all things
[1:02:17] are possible. You understand because
[1:02:20] he's here in five minutes. Amen. There's
[1:02:23] not a situation in the building that
[1:02:25] couldn't be changed. I understand by my
[1:02:28] eyes of understanding. Amen. That he's a
[1:02:30] healer this morning the same as he was.
[1:02:33] Amen. In brother Brandham's day. Amen.
[1:02:35] And I choose to lean not to my own
[1:02:37] understanding. Amen. But to lean on the
[1:02:40] promises of God. Amen. Sometimes you got
[1:02:43] to get your focus back cuz there's a lot
[1:02:46] of distractions trying to get your focus
[1:02:48] on the wrong thing. Trying to get you to
[1:02:50] focus on just your job alone or your
[1:02:52] your school alone. Those things are
[1:02:54] okay, but Satan's trying to get your
[1:02:56] focus. Amen. Just like he might have got
[1:02:58] them in in the book of Numbers just to
[1:03:01] focus on that snake bite. Say, "Well, it
[1:03:04] hurts pretty bad." Well, well, look,
[1:03:06] it's it's bleeding. There's gut blood
[1:03:08] gushing from it. And if all if if that
[1:03:10] was all they ever looked at, they
[1:03:13] wouldn't look, Brother Brian, and see
[1:03:15] that B serpent sitting on the pole.
[1:03:18] Amen. So that's why you got to get your
[1:03:19] focus back on the word of God. Amen. And
[1:03:22] look to what the Bible says.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what those 10 spies had to
[1:03:28] do. Amen. They had to choose to look
[1:03:30] away. Amen. From the giants, amen. To
[1:03:33] look to the land that God had promised,
[1:03:36] Amen. that they were going to possess.
[1:03:38] Amen. And they looked away. Amen. From
[1:03:41] the symptoms. They looked away from the
[1:03:43] giants. And they looked to the promise.
[1:03:46] Amen. Just like Jonah had to do in the
[1:03:48] belly of a whale. Amen. He had to look
[1:03:50] away from the bells from the whale's
[1:03:53] belly and the lying vanities and say,
[1:03:55] "Once more, Lord, will I look again to
[1:03:58] your holy temple?" Amen. Once more will
[1:04:00] I choose to look away from the symptoms.
[1:04:03] Amen. Uh Bethany found this quote the
[1:04:05] other day. I thought it was powerful. is
[1:04:07] that it depends on what you're looking
[1:04:08] at. If you're looking at your symptoms,
[1:04:11] they'll be there. But if you look to
[1:04:13] God's word, symptoms will have to
[1:04:16] vanish. Amen. I believe this morning
[1:04:18] there is the possibility that you can be
[1:04:20] right smack dab in the middle of
[1:04:22] something and you don't even see it.
[1:04:24] Amen. You say, "Amen. Don't you see,
[1:04:26] brother Isaac all the trouble? Don't you
[1:04:28] see all the all the churches and all the
[1:04:30] bickering and all this and that?" No, I
[1:04:32] have chose to look. Amen. I see it with
[1:04:35] these eyes. But thank God we've been
[1:04:37] given eyes of understanding. Amen. That
[1:04:39] we could focus our vision on the word of
[1:04:41] God and say, "I see Jesus. I see a
[1:04:44] rapture." Amen. Just ahead. I see a body
[1:04:47] change. I see prodigals coming home. Oh,
[1:04:50] there's power in looking away. Amen.
[1:04:53] Because brother Bram said, Amen. that
[1:04:55] those messengers, the each age would
[1:04:57] look away from the previous church and
[1:05:00] look to that pillar of fire and they
[1:05:02] would walk into a a a new age into
[1:05:05] Methodist and Pentecost into Luther. He
[1:05:09] said, but the children would come behind
[1:05:11] them and instead of looking forward,
[1:05:13] they would look back to what they came
[1:05:14] out of and they would go right back to
[1:05:17] the same thing. A mean because you go
[1:05:20] the direction that you're looking. And
[1:05:22] when but didn't brother Brandon teacher
[1:05:24] sat with the boy riding on the bicycle
[1:05:26] and all the boys that looked to the left
[1:05:27] and the right that's exactly where they
[1:05:29] went. But the boy that looked to the end
[1:05:32] went to the end of the road. Amen. And
[1:05:34] so there's power looking away. Amen.
[1:05:36] From the belly of the well and looking
[1:05:39] to the temple that God has raised up and
[1:05:41] say, "Oh God, I'm choosing to look away
[1:05:43] from my symptoms." Amen. Because if you
[1:05:46] look at your symptoms, that's the
[1:05:47] direction you're going to go. If you
[1:05:49] look at the trouble, that's the
[1:05:51] direction you're going to go. Oh, so
[1:05:53] look up, friends. Amen. Because that's
[1:05:56] the direction we want to go this
[1:05:58] morning.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Looking away and looking again to
[1:06:02] the promise of God. Amen. I I You say,
[1:06:05] "I've looked wrong, brother Isaac. I
[1:06:07] I've been looking at the wrong thing."
[1:06:09] Then you can look again. That's what
[1:06:12] Jonah said. It says, "Yet will I look
[1:06:14] again toward thy holy temple." And
[1:06:17] brother Brandham said that that
[1:06:18] scripture prophesied and mean that the
[1:06:21] world wouldn't see him but yet ye shall
[1:06:23] see me. He said there it is. That's
[1:06:25] proof you can look again. Amen. Elijah
[1:06:30] when he was promised a it was going to
[1:06:32] rain and he had Gahazi go out and look.
[1:06:35] You know it was the seventh time before
[1:06:38] he ever saw any sort of change. But he
[1:06:41] kept looking again and looking again.
[1:06:44] And by the seventh time, he said, "Oh, I
[1:06:46] see something." Off in the distance, "I
[1:06:48] see a cloud the size of a man's hand."
[1:06:51] And when Brother Brandham said this
[1:06:53] morning, if that little thing has
[1:06:55] touched your heart and says, "I need
[1:06:57] that." That's that little sign the size
[1:07:00] of a hand of a man. Amen. Something in
[1:07:03] your heart this morning is saying, "I
[1:07:05] need my joy back. I need my peace back.
[1:07:08] I need my family back. But I just don't
[1:07:11] see it." Brother Isaac, that's a sign
[1:07:13] right there. If you just look in the
[1:07:15] distance, there's a little cloud about
[1:07:17] the size of a fish coming over the
[1:07:19] horizon. And if you just keep looking,
[1:07:21] that cloud will become a thundercloud.
[1:07:24] And all of a sudden, it's going to rain.
[1:07:26] Amen. The promises are going to rain
[1:07:28] upon your life. Amen. Because you just
[1:07:30] kept looking. Amen. To that ser that
[1:07:33] brass serpent. You just kept looking to
[1:07:35] the promise and it'll pour out
[1:07:37] everything that you have need of. Amen.
[1:07:40] asked what brother Brandham had to do
[1:07:41] when that cloud picture was taken in
[1:07:43] 1963. He said, "Amen, a spiritual
[1:07:47] revelation had to cause him to turn it
[1:07:49] to the right." He said it was at the
[1:07:51] wrong angle, but when he turned it to
[1:07:53] the right, he said, "That's my Lord up
[1:07:56] there." And because sometimes you're
[1:07:58] looking at things through the wrong
[1:07:59] angle. Oh, you know, Brother Brandon
[1:08:02] said there was that cloud picture. I
[1:08:03] think it was in Germany. is that if you
[1:08:05] were off at a distance, it looked like
[1:08:08] it looked like thunder clouds, dark,
[1:08:10] stormy clouds, but when you got down and
[1:08:12] kneelled and looked up, it said it was
[1:08:14] angel's wings beating together. Amen.
[1:08:17] Because it was the wrong angle. Oh,
[1:08:21] amen. If you're looking at your trial
[1:08:23] through the wrong angle, you're going to
[1:08:24] say, "What's wrong? Is God judging me?
[1:08:27] What have I done to deserve this? Does
[1:08:28] he not love me? Has he forgotten me?"
[1:08:30] But he said, "No, it's just blessings in
[1:08:33] disguisement." Amen. It It's just my
[1:08:36] angel's wings gathering you onto myself,
[1:08:39] putting you through a test and a trial
[1:08:41] to show you how much I love you. Oh, you
[1:08:45] got to look at the right angle.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; To them that are looking for him, will
[1:08:50] he appear the second time? To them that
[1:08:53] are looking, that's how you unlock the
[1:08:56] blessing. Look and live.
[1:09:00] Look to the atonement and live. Get your
[1:09:03] eyes off of everything else. Look away
[1:09:06] from everything contrary and look and
[1:09:09] live this morning.
[1:09:11] Amen. We're here to lift it up. They
[1:09:14] said, "What are we lifting? Are we
[1:09:15] lifting ourselves? Are we lifting our
[1:09:18] our church? Are we lifting this or
[1:09:19] that?" No, we're here to lift Christ. I
[1:09:23] mean, because Satan had a plan to lift
[1:09:25] himself.
[1:09:27] You'll find it in Isaiah 14. It says,
[1:09:30] "How art thou fallen from heaven, oh
[1:09:32] Lucifer, son of the morning? How art
[1:09:34] thou cut down to the ground which did
[1:09:36] just weaken the nations?
[1:09:39] For thou hast said in thine heart, I
[1:09:41] will ascend into heaven. I will exalt my
[1:09:43] throne above the stars of God. I will
[1:09:46] also I will sit also upon the mount of
[1:09:48] the congregation in the sides of the
[1:09:50] north." Now, this is Satan's heart. This
[1:09:53] is his boast. I will ascend above the
[1:09:55] heights of the clouds. I will be like
[1:09:57] the most high. Yet thou shalt be brought
[1:10:00] down to hell to the sides of the pit.
[1:10:04] You see, this was where sin began in the
[1:10:07] in heaven. Brother Brand said it didn't
[1:10:09] just begin in the garden. It began in
[1:10:12] heaven when Satan began to try to exalt
[1:10:15] himself against God. And he he he had an
[1:10:18] ambition to be like God. He wanted he he
[1:10:20] had a a plan, a purpose, a desire that
[1:10:23] he would be exalted above the stars or
[1:10:26] brother Brandon would say above the suns
[1:10:29] of God that the sons might worship him.
[1:10:32] He had a great desire to build himself
[1:10:34] in Eden. Amen. That he could have his
[1:10:37] own Eden where he would be the center of
[1:10:39] worship. Amen. And brother Brandham said
[1:10:41] that he has succeeded in carrying out
[1:10:43] his threats and explaining away amen
[1:10:47] from the people in every age the value
[1:10:49] of God's promised word to that age. Now
[1:10:53] we want to see at who this person was
[1:10:55] that was speaking. Brother Brandham
[1:10:57] teaches us that it's Satan. Amen. But
[1:11:00] but he says that Paul saw the same one
[1:11:03] that Isaiah saw in 2 Thessalonians 2,
[1:11:06] which brother Brandham uses to speak
[1:11:08] about the first horse rider, the white
[1:11:11] horse rider, the antichrist spirit.
[1:11:13] Because in 2 Thessalonians 2, it says,
[1:11:15] "Who opposeth and exalteth himself above
[1:11:18] all that is called God or that is
[1:11:20] worshiped, so that he as God sitth in
[1:11:23] the temple of God, showing himself that
[1:11:26] he is God." That's that Antichrist
[1:11:27] spirit. Brother Bram said that Paul and
[1:11:29] Isaiah saw the same one. Amen. And we
[1:11:32] also see it in the book of 2 Chronicles
[1:11:35] 26 how there was a man named Uzziah.
[1:11:39] Amen. Who got a little bit Amen. Too big
[1:11:42] for his britches. I I guess we could say
[1:11:44] I don't know where that came from, but
[1:11:46] Amen. I guess you say that here maybe.
[1:11:49] Amen. And he got a little bit exalted
[1:11:53] above I mean what he should have been.
[1:11:55] And he went in to offer incense which
[1:11:58] was the position of the priest. And he
[1:12:00] tried to take the position of the priest
[1:12:02] and exalt himself above. Amen. His
[1:12:05] position. Amen. And leprosy struck him.
[1:12:08] Amen. And he was cast down and the sin
[1:12:11] of leprosy because he tried to exalt
[1:12:13] himself. Amen. And brother Brand said
[1:12:15] that's what the denominations have done.
[1:12:17] It's selfexaltation.
[1:12:19] Amen. And they've been struck with the
[1:12:21] leprosy. Amen. of unbelief because
[1:12:23] they've lost their grip on the word and
[1:12:26] tried to exalt creeds, tried to exalt
[1:12:29] themselves above the word. I mean, isn't
[1:12:32] that what the serpent did in the Garden
[1:12:34] of Eden when it said, "You shall not
[1:12:36] surely die, trying to exalt himself
[1:12:39] above the word of God." And brother
[1:12:41] Brandham said, "That's what the Catholic
[1:12:43] Church is doing." They say, "We are the
[1:12:45] voice regardless of what the word says."
[1:12:48] and they've exalted themselves into a
[1:12:51] position until they've placed the
[1:12:53] authority of the church above the
[1:12:55] authority of the word. And they make
[1:12:58] their offers and to men and women
[1:13:00] saying, "Come to our church and we'll
[1:13:02] give you a better position. Come and
[1:13:04] we'll give you more money. Come and
[1:13:06] you'll have more popularity. Come and
[1:13:09] you'll be exalted." Amen. In our in in
[1:13:12] our great denomination. Amen. But
[1:13:15] there's a principle in the Bible that
[1:13:16] says that he which would try to exalt
[1:13:19] himself shall be abased. And I'm so glad
[1:13:23] that this scripture says and that
[1:13:25] whosoever shall exalt himself shall be
[1:13:27] abased. Amen. It says yet to that Satan
[1:13:30] up in heaven thou shalt be brought down
[1:13:33] to hell to the sides of the pit. In Luke
[1:13:36] 10 it says and he said unto them, I
[1:13:38] beheld Satan as lightning fall from
[1:13:41] heaven and he was cast out. Amen. from
[1:13:44] his position in heaven. Amen. To be a
[1:13:47] base down into the form of a serpent.
[1:13:51] Amen. But he that is humble shall be
[1:13:53] exalted. Amen. So that's why we're not
[1:13:56] here this morning to exalt ourselves.
[1:13:58] That's why we're not here to just exalt
[1:14:00] a man or exalt a church or establish
[1:14:03] ourselves. Amen. But we are here amen a
[1:14:06] as message believers to establish the
[1:14:09] word in the hearts of the people like
[1:14:11] Paul commanded us to do. He said, "I
[1:14:13] came not in excellency of speech or in
[1:14:16] wisdom." Amen. But he came to establish
[1:14:19] the word in the hearts of the people,
[1:14:22] not to exalt ourselves. Amen. But you
[1:14:25] let God do the exalting. Oh, but he
[1:14:28] which humbles himself to the word of
[1:14:30] God, Amen, shall be exalted in due time.
[1:14:35] Amen. But Satan always tries to exalt
[1:14:38] himself and he ends up humiliated.
[1:14:42] He ends up in a place of great humility.
[1:14:46] Amen. But when Jesus came, he came in
[1:14:49] humility and he was exalted. Amen.
[1:14:53] That's our Amen. That's our our antitype
[1:14:57] of the brass serpent was Jesus when he
[1:15:00] came on Calvary. Amen. Now, if we could
[1:15:02] just if we could just follow the path of
[1:15:05] the son of man for a moment, if you'll
[1:15:08] give me grace. Here was this son of man.
[1:15:11] Amen. And he was dwelling there up in
[1:15:13] heaven. Amen. But there was a a a
[1:15:15] scriptural prophecy that the son of man,
[1:15:18] amen, must be lifted up. Jesus said,
[1:15:20] "Even so must the son of man be lifted
[1:15:22] up." And there he was going to come down
[1:15:25] to to Calvary and be a type of that
[1:15:27] brass serpent. And brother Brandon said,
[1:15:29] "People, you know, don't understand how
[1:15:31] that serpent could be a type of Jesus."
[1:15:34] He said it was a type in this. It was
[1:15:36] absolutely dead. Amen. It was no life
[1:15:40] left in it. It was crystallized there on
[1:15:42] that pole in the book of Numbers. He
[1:15:44] said that's why it was a type of Jesus
[1:15:46] because when he came, he absolutely died
[1:15:50] on the cross. And when he absolutely
[1:15:53] bore your sin and your iniquity and
[1:15:55] judged it on the cross of Calvary, he
[1:15:59] hung on a tree that he might take the
[1:16:01] curse, amen, off of your life. Amen.
[1:16:04] We're not looking to the tree. Amen.
[1:16:06] We're looking to what hung on the tree.
[1:16:08] our Jesus. Amen. Our savior that hung on
[1:16:11] the tree and came in humility. The Bible
[1:16:15] says, "What and if you shall see the son
[1:16:17] of man ascend, Amen. up where he was
[1:16:20] before." Amen. In John 2, and no man
[1:16:24] hath ascended up to heaven, but he that
[1:16:26] came down from heaven. So you see, Jesus
[1:16:29] was in heaven. He existed in heaven.
[1:16:32] Amen. But he humbled himself and was
[1:16:34] made lower than the angels that he might
[1:16:37] be abased. Amen. That he might lift up
[1:16:40] sons and daughters of God. And when it
[1:16:42] was prophesied that he was going to be
[1:16:45] lifted, so must the son of man be lifted
[1:16:47] up. When ye have lifted up the son of
[1:16:50] man, ye shall know I am he. These are
[1:16:52] all scriptures in the book of John. The
[1:16:54] hour come that the son of man might be
[1:16:58] glorified. If I be lifted up, I will
[1:17:01] draw. Signifying what death he would
[1:17:04] die. And now is the son of man
[1:17:06] glorified. And God is glorified in him.
[1:17:11] You see, Jesus came, the son of man, and
[1:17:14] descended from heaven. But he come to be
[1:17:17] glorified again and lifted up on
[1:17:19] Calvary. And in the garden of
[1:17:22] Gethsemane, brother Bram said that Jesus
[1:17:24] fought it out with Satan in the garden
[1:17:27] of Gethsemane. and won back the Eden.
[1:17:30] Oh, glory to God. Satan had been
[1:17:33] building himself in Eden. Amen. For
[1:17:35] thousands of years, amen. But the son of
[1:17:37] man came in a path of humility and
[1:17:40] fought it out in the garden and he won
[1:17:42] back the Eden. Amen. For his spiritual
[1:17:45] seed that they might have a place to go.
[1:17:48] And when he went to Calvary, Amen. He
[1:17:51] bruised the head of that old serpent.
[1:17:54] Amen. That had come, Amen. from the
[1:17:56] garden that was cast down out of out of
[1:17:58] heaven and that had been trying to bite
[1:18:01] sons and daughters of God. Amen. From
[1:18:03] the beginning, amen. Of the garden of
[1:18:06] Eden. Oh, but our son of man came down
[1:18:09] and put his foot upon the head of that
[1:18:11] thing and bruised that old serpent
[1:18:14] devil. Amen. That had been trying to
[1:18:16] destroy sons and daughters and was
[1:18:18] lifted up on the cross that we might
[1:18:20] have something to look to and live.
[1:18:26] I I this is powerful to me what I just
[1:18:28] was finding this quote you know the
[1:18:31] first person and when begin to look to
[1:18:33] him before he ever even drew his last
[1:18:35] breath that thief on the right before he
[1:18:39] ever drew his last breath and then you
[1:18:41] see it matters how you look because
[1:18:43] there was two thieves and brother
[1:18:44] Brandham said there was four people
[1:18:46] hanging on the cross that day oh my he
[1:18:50] said there was Jesus and Judas God and
[1:18:52] Satan and there was a thief on the left
[1:18:55] and there was a thief on the right,
[1:18:56] brother and sister. But when that thief
[1:18:59] and on the left said, "If thou be the
[1:19:02] son of God, take us down." And brother
[1:19:04] Bram said, the other one said, "Lord, we
[1:19:06] do justly getting punished, but you've
[1:19:08] done nothing. Remember we remember me
[1:19:11] when you come into your kingdom in that
[1:19:14] day." Amen. The seed of Satan went with
[1:19:18] Judas down into the pits. Amen. But the
[1:19:21] man on the right went with the son of
[1:19:23] man. Amen. to paradise that day because
[1:19:26] he chose to look a through the eyes of
[1:19:29] understanding and say, "Lord, oh, have
[1:19:32] mercy on me. Have mercy on me, Lord.
[1:19:35] Give me a pardon. Give me your grace,
[1:19:37] Lord." And pardon was released to the
[1:19:40] one that looked upon him as a pardoning
[1:19:42] God. Oh, Brother Brham said, "He came
[1:19:44] from heaven down to hell that he might
[1:19:47] take us from hell back up to heaven."
[1:19:50] Oh, what a son of man. What a
[1:19:53] condescension. Amen. To come down and
[1:19:55] lift up a bride. Oh, into glory. Amen.
[1:19:59] But it didn't stop there. Amen. But he
[1:20:01] went to the regions of loss. Amen. And
[1:20:03] he was going to play the role of a high
[1:20:05] priest. And the Bible says that he
[1:20:08] prophesied that they would receive
[1:20:09] power. It said when he had spoken these
[1:20:12] things while they beheld, he was taken
[1:20:14] up and a cloud received him out of their
[1:20:17] sight. But while they looked steadfastly
[1:20:19] toward heaven, as he went up, behold,
[1:20:22] two men stood by them in white apparel,
[1:20:24] and said, "Which also said, Ye men of
[1:20:26] Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into
[1:20:28] heaven?
[1:20:30] This same Jesus, which is taken up from
[1:20:33] you into heaven, shall so come in like
[1:20:35] manner as ye have seen him go."
[1:20:39] Brother Brand said that ascension was
[1:20:40] one of the greatest days that there ever
[1:20:43] was because since the Garden of Eden,
[1:20:46] heavens had been shut off from mankind.
[1:20:49] But there dominion that belonged to
[1:20:52] Satan, our high priest came with his own
[1:20:55] blood and he began to ascend back up to
[1:20:59] the to the right hand of God. Brother Br
[1:21:02] said he came to the lowest. Amen. But
[1:21:04] God set him up on a pinnacle. God set
[1:21:06] him up so high that he would have to
[1:21:09] look down to see heaven. And he come
[1:21:11] down and he tore everything that Satan
[1:21:14] had ever built. I mean, he tore the
[1:21:17] dominion of the devil. He tore the veil
[1:21:20] of sickness. He tore the veil of sin. He
[1:21:23] tore the veil of worry. He tore the veil
[1:21:26] of depression. He tore the veil of
[1:21:28] anxiety. And the channel of the Holy
[1:21:31] Ghost is open this morning. Brother
[1:21:32] Brandham said he came homeless to make a
[1:21:35] way for homeless men and women. Brother
[1:21:38] Brham said he rent the veil that you
[1:21:40] could be saved. He rent the veil that
[1:21:42] you've committed adultery if you have
[1:21:45] cursed. If you've done anything wrong,
[1:21:47] he rent that veil for you. That stick
[1:21:49] that Satan holds over you. He rent it if
[1:21:52] you'll only receive him. You see what
[1:21:55] Jesus did in his ascension? He rent the
[1:21:58] veil. Amen. that Satan's Eden had
[1:22:01] blocked off God from fellowshipping with
[1:22:03] his people from the Garden of Eden. But
[1:22:06] when Jesus came down and paid the shed
[1:22:09] blood, he rent the veil of that stick
[1:22:12] the devil's been holding over you. Oh,
[1:22:15] that old stick that he tries to beat you
[1:22:17] down with day after day after day and
[1:22:20] say, "You're never going to be good
[1:22:21] enough. You're never going to amount to
[1:22:23] nothing. You're never going to go in a
[1:22:25] rapture. You're never going to make it
[1:22:27] to that marriage supper. You're never
[1:22:29] going to. You're never going to. You're
[1:22:31] never going to. Have you ever heard that
[1:22:32] voice? Amen. But the veil of that voice
[1:22:35] was rent on the day where Jesus shed
[1:22:38] that blood and became a high priest.
[1:22:40] Amen. For your Amen. deliverance. Oh,
[1:22:43] but it didn't stop there. Amen. But the
[1:22:46] next time Stephen saw him when they were
[1:22:48] stoning him and killing him for standing
[1:22:51] for the word, he said, "Behold, I see
[1:22:53] the heavens opened and the son of man
[1:22:56] standing on the right hand of God."
[1:22:59] Ephesians 1, which he wrought in Christ
[1:23:02] when he raised him from the dead, and
[1:23:03] set him at his own right hand in the
[1:23:06] heavenly places, far above all
[1:23:09] principality, far above all power,
[1:23:12] might, dominion, and every name that is
[1:23:15] named, not only in this world, but also
[1:23:17] in that which is to come, and hath put
[1:23:19] all things under his feet, and hath give
[1:23:22] him to be the head over all things to
[1:23:24] the church. Psalms 97 says, "Thou, oh
[1:23:26] Lord, are high above all the earth. Thou
[1:23:29] art exalted far above all gods." Oh, he
[1:23:33] was exalted and above every
[1:23:35] principality, above every power, above
[1:23:38] every dominion, above every name that
[1:23:41] could ever be named and put at a right
[1:23:44] hand where he would begin to intercede
[1:23:47] upon your confession.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. our sons and daughters. Amen.
[1:23:51] Brother Ray, could come back into
[1:23:53] fellowship and begin to speak the word
[1:23:55] again over their situation. And when he
[1:23:58] was lifted up, Amen. when he was lifted
[1:24:01] up above everything that the devil had
[1:24:04] established, there is a way by one
[1:24:07] spirit, you can be baptized into one
[1:24:09] body that if Jesus is above it, so are
[1:24:12] you. Amen. Because if you are in Jesus
[1:24:15] and Jesus is above it, then you can live
[1:24:18] above it, too. Amen. He come to lift
[1:24:21] sons and daughters back into a seat of
[1:24:23] authority. He come to lift you into
[1:24:25] heavenly places with him. He didn't come
[1:24:28] to lead you down and in a world of
[1:24:31] torment, but he says you can have
[1:24:32] dominion over your flesh. You can have
[1:24:35] dominion over sin and you can have
[1:24:37] dominion over the devil. Oh, I say this
[1:24:40] morning that you can live as high as you
[1:24:43] can lift my Jesus. Amen. Because if you
[1:24:46] only lift this message to just another
[1:24:49] church, you'll never be able to rise
[1:24:50] above, Amen. sin. You'll never be able
[1:24:53] to rise above a halfway life. You'll
[1:24:55] never be able to rise above the makeup
[1:24:57] and the high heels and the and the
[1:24:59] depression and the anxiety. You'll never
[1:25:01] be able to rise above it. But if you
[1:25:03] lift it up into a place where it is the
[1:25:05] revealing of the son of man, then
[1:25:07] brother, you can go so high above those
[1:25:10] things and it'll lift you into the place
[1:25:13] of a joint air. It'll lift you into a
[1:25:15] place of adopted sons. It'll lift you
[1:25:18] into a place of a manifested son or
[1:25:21] daughter of God. It'll place you on a
[1:25:23] throne of overcoming. Oh, because that's
[1:25:26] where I'm placing him. And when I place
[1:25:28] him down here, then I'll go down there.
[1:25:31] But if I place him where he really is,
[1:25:33] oh, you can rise into a seat of
[1:25:36] authority and go where you belong. Amen.
[1:25:40] That's why I'm lift the answer above the
[1:25:42] problem. Amen. Lift the answer above the
[1:25:45] situation. Amen. Lift the answer above
[1:25:48] what you're going through. Amen. And
[1:25:50] say, "Well, mine's a hard case, Brother
[1:25:52] Isaac, but it said every name." Amen.
[1:25:55] So, you can name your devil. You can
[1:25:58] name your struggle. You can name your
[1:26:00] trial this morning. And I say that he is
[1:26:03] above it.
[1:26:05] He's above depression. He's above
[1:26:08] anxiety. I mean, he's above sickness.
[1:26:11] He's above cancer. He's above blood
[1:26:14] sugars, amen, that are off and blood
[1:26:16] pressures. He's above, Amen. Amen. every
[1:26:20] sickness that you could think of. He's
[1:26:22] above the spirit of suicide. Amen. We
[1:26:25] just had a young boy in our camp. Amen.
[1:26:28] He He fellowships with our church. Amen.
[1:26:31] Quite a bit. Amen. And he was Amen. He
[1:26:34] said, "I've always struggled with my
[1:26:35] faith." He said, "I I didn't even
[1:26:39] believe in heaven." He said, "I thought
[1:26:40] that was something that was created a
[1:26:43] few millennia ago to cope with the
[1:26:45] thought of afterlife. I didn't even
[1:26:46] believe I He said, "I would I would cry
[1:26:49] myself to sleep almost every night
[1:26:51] thinking about what what would happen
[1:26:53] after he died. I I would go down to I I
[1:26:56] would cry myself to sleep. I I would
[1:26:58] struggle even so much till Amen. before
[1:27:01] Amen. before camp, he got out a pen and
[1:27:03] paper and was going to write a note."
[1:27:05] Amen. But he he couldn't go through with
[1:27:07] it. But he was that low. Amen. But he
[1:27:10] came to the the camp. Amen. And he would
[1:27:12] fall asleep in the services and sit
[1:27:14] there. Amen. Amen. Like a bump on the
[1:27:16] log. But something drew him into that
[1:27:19] prayer line. And when he went through
[1:27:20] that prayer line, it said it was like
[1:27:22] God was speaking straight through every
[1:27:24] minister. Amen. He said he'd been
[1:27:26] through prayer lines after prayer line
[1:27:28] and he never felt a mean that. But God
[1:27:30] met him in that prayer line and he felt
[1:27:32] the weight lift off of him. He said, "I
[1:27:35] felt the presence of God and it felt
[1:27:37] like love." Amen. He He had long shaggy
[1:27:40] hair. I mean, he's got a fresh haircut.
[1:27:43] He said the the worldly desires are
[1:27:45] gone. He said the suicidal thoughts are
[1:27:47] gone. Amen. Because my God has been
[1:27:50] lifted above the spirit of suicide. My
[1:27:52] God has been lifted above the spirit of
[1:27:54] depression. My God has been lifted above
[1:27:57] those belittling thoughts and those
[1:27:59] tormenting devils. Oh, my Jesus has been
[1:28:03] lifted above every anxious thought.
[1:28:06] Amen. Amen. Give it over to Jesus. Amen.
[1:28:09] It's time that you stop carrying it and
[1:28:10] you put it in the hands of the one who
[1:28:13] was meant to carry it. Amen. Let go and
[1:28:15] let God carry your burden. Mother, let
[1:28:17] go. Father, let go and let God. Amen.
[1:28:20] Carry your anxious thoughts. Take no
[1:28:22] thought for tomorrow. Tomorrow will take
[1:28:25] thought for itself. Amen. Commit it to
[1:28:27] God. Oh, he's over every backsliding
[1:28:30] devil. There was another young man who
[1:28:33] had got away from the Lord from our
[1:28:35] church. I mean, he was he said he
[1:28:37] planned a vacation to Florida and he
[1:28:39] said he planned it over two Sundays just
[1:28:41] so he can miss two services cuz he
[1:28:43] didn't want to come to church. Amen. It
[1:28:45] was getting pretty bad. Amen. We were
[1:28:47] hearing things he was saying. Amen. That
[1:28:49] it was just blowing people away the
[1:28:51] stuff that he was saying. Amen. But he
[1:28:53] said that brother Wayne preached a
[1:28:55] sermon and he was speaking just in a
[1:28:58] passing moment about how God will make
[1:29:00] somebody in in a bar, you know, speak to
[1:29:02] you about Jesus. And while he was down
[1:29:05] there in Florida, there was something
[1:29:06] happened at a Waffle House, he said. And
[1:29:08] he just went in there to just to talk to
[1:29:10] him about what had happened. I don't
[1:29:11] know what it was. And said while he was
[1:29:13] in there, and when that weight waiter, I
[1:29:16] believe it was, be to speak to him and
[1:29:18] he said he had tattoos, I think, long
[1:29:20] hair, long hair, looked like a hippie.
[1:29:22] said he wouldn't expect him to speak to
[1:29:24] him about Jesus, but he started telling
[1:29:26] him over and over again, "God is testing
[1:29:28] you. God is testing you." They're in a
[1:29:30] Waffle House in Florida. Amen. God
[1:29:33] remembered his son and he said, "God is
[1:29:36] testing you." And he came back to
[1:29:37] church. Amen. And he's been coming to
[1:29:39] church. Amen. Ever since pretty
[1:29:41] consistently, he went to the camp and
[1:29:43] God met him in that camp. Amen. And
[1:29:45] brought a deliverance to his life. And
[1:29:47] now he's coming to church. I mean, he's
[1:29:49] serving the Lord. Amen. Because our God
[1:29:52] is above that backsliding devil. Amen.
[1:29:55] Our God is above. Amen. Every devil.
[1:29:58] Amen. Amen. Put the name of your devil.
[1:30:00] I say, "My God is above it." You say,
[1:30:03] "What are you doing, brother Isaac?" I'm
[1:30:04] lifting Jesus higher. Amen. My Spencer,
[1:30:08] one of his favorite songs when we're
[1:30:09] pushing him on the scene, he says,
[1:30:10] "Higher, higher." And then he'll start
[1:30:12] breaking out in a song. Higher, higher,
[1:30:15] higher, higher. Cast your burdens onto
[1:30:17] Jesus. I mean, I I I think that's pretty
[1:30:19] good. Amen. If you want to go higher,
[1:30:22] Amen. start start pushing the swing
[1:30:24] higher. And then if you want to go
[1:30:26] higher, start lifting Jesus higher.
[1:30:29] Amen. Higher. Higher. Lift him out of
[1:30:31] history. Lift him out of the history
[1:30:33] books. Lift him out of yesterday. Lift
[1:30:36] him out of last week. Amen. Lift him out
[1:30:39] of last month and say, "Jesus, you are
[1:30:41] the same yesterday, today, and forever."
[1:30:45] Oh, that wave sheath was waved in the
[1:30:48] life of Jesus. I mean that wave sheath
[1:30:50] and brother Brandham would teach us was
[1:30:52] the first one to come to maturity and
[1:30:54] then and it showed that the rest of the
[1:30:56] field would come to maturity and Jesus
[1:30:59] was the first one to come to maturity
[1:31:01] and he was waved on the day of Pentecost
[1:31:03] and that the same spirit that dwelt in
[1:31:05] him might dwell in a bride and that he
[1:31:08] could say the same works that I do shall
[1:31:10] ye do also because I live ye live also.
[1:31:14] that the same one that brought me to
[1:31:16] maturity is going to bring a bride to
[1:31:18] maturity. And what happened in Jesus
[1:31:21] ministry, the sick were healed. Amen.
[1:31:24] The blind saw. Amen. The dead raised.
[1:31:27] The deaf heard. Amen. Amen. The lame
[1:31:30] walked. Amen. But it said it would be
[1:31:32] waved again in this last day. Amen. And
[1:31:35] brother Brandham, I believe, was the
[1:31:38] first son in this evening time to come
[1:31:40] to maturity. Amen. Because the son of
[1:31:42] man was being revealed in him and he was
[1:31:46] raised up and saying be the same spirit
[1:31:48] that would dwell in a prophet. Oh, if it
[1:31:51] would get in a bride, amen, it would
[1:31:53] lift you also. Amen. And in brother
[1:31:56] Brandon miss in his ministry. Amen.
[1:31:59] Squirrels appeared, missing eyes
[1:32:01] appeared. Amen. Storms were spoken out
[1:32:04] of existence. Amen. And because amen, he
[1:32:08] was the first son to come to maturity.
[1:32:10] Oh, it shows. Amen. That we can too
[1:32:14] because the same one, oh my, dwelling in
[1:32:17] a bride will lift you into that same
[1:32:20] level of maturity. Amen. That born sons,
[1:32:23] field sons could speak and their word
[1:32:26] would be backed. Amen. Even so must the
[1:32:29] son of man be lifted up. Amen. We're
[1:32:31] going to we're going to we're going to
[1:32:33] bring out final few points here. Amen.
[1:32:36] Amen. But we're following that path of
[1:32:38] that son of man. Amen. And here he is.
[1:32:40] Brother Brandham said he's here tonight.
[1:32:44] He's still lifted up. He was put into
[1:32:46] the grave. And God lifted him up. And
[1:32:49] his spirit is among us tonight doing
[1:32:51] signs and wonders. Do you believe it?
[1:32:54] And brother Brandham said in one
[1:32:56] meeting, he said uh yesterday,
[1:32:59] they were building platforms for
[1:33:01] President Kennedy and for President
[1:33:04] Nixon to see who they would elect as
[1:33:07] their great president. He said,
[1:33:08] "Tonight, I'm building a platform for
[1:33:10] Jesus Christ that we might elect him as
[1:33:13] savior that we might elect him as our
[1:33:15] healer." Amen. And he lifted up the son
[1:33:19] of man in his ministry. Amen. Did he not
[1:33:22] say it was he down at the river that
[1:33:24] day? Amen. It was he that said, "As I
[1:33:27] was with Moses, so I will be with you."
[1:33:29] It was he, amen, that said, "The
[1:33:31] neverfailing presence will be with you
[1:33:33] wherever you go." It was he. And when
[1:33:36] that came and put the sword in my hand
[1:33:38] in Sabino Canyon, it was he. It was he
[1:33:41] that gave me the vision of that cloud
[1:33:42] like a triangle. It was he. It was he.
[1:33:45] It was he. Brother said that's where
[1:33:47] they missed it. And when they couldn't
[1:33:48] see that he wasn't the son of man, but
[1:33:51] he was a son of man revealing the son of
[1:33:54] man. And when he came to the end of his
[1:33:55] road, he said, "I must decrease, but he
[1:33:59] must increase. And my ministry is to
[1:34:01] declare him. He is here." As it was in
[1:34:05] the days of Sodom, so will it be at the
[1:34:07] revealing of the Son of Man.
[1:34:11] Sarah, why do you laugh in your heart?
[1:34:15] She's behind you in the tent. Brother
[1:34:17] Bram said, "I've been having my back to
[1:34:19] the audience every night this week. I
[1:34:22] forget which meeting he was in." Amen.
[1:34:25] Amen. So close that people would say he
[1:34:28] was the son of man. But he said, "No,
[1:34:30] who is this Melzdc?"
[1:34:32] And who is this? Amen. Who am I
[1:34:35] revealing? It's the son of man being
[1:34:38] revealed. Amen. I I like this because
[1:34:42] Oral Roberts would lay his hands on
[1:34:45] everybody. He would tell him to touch a
[1:34:46] radio or touch this or touch that.
[1:34:48] Brother Brandham said it was a point of
[1:34:50] contact. He said that's wonderful or you
[1:34:53] know anything that you can have a point
[1:34:55] of contact. But brother Bram said, "Now
[1:34:57] to my meetings, it's a supernatural
[1:35:00] being that's absolutely in the meeting
[1:35:03] and you can see it moving." Brother Bram
[1:35:05] said, "My ministry is not a personal
[1:35:07] contact to each one. It's to lift up
[1:35:10] Jesus Christ so everyone can see his
[1:35:14] presence." Oh, glory. People criticize
[1:35:17] brother Brandham for not praying for
[1:35:19] enough people. But I'm glad he didn't
[1:35:21] because he was doing something. He said,
[1:35:23] "I can't do that for each one because my
[1:35:25] ministry is different. My ministry is to
[1:35:28] lift up the son of man so that others
[1:35:30] might see his presence. Oh, my ministry
[1:35:33] is to declare him and lift him up that
[1:35:36] those would have a hunger to see Jesus
[1:35:38] could see him." Oh, amen. But you know
[1:35:42] what they did in the book of Numbers?
[1:35:43] They begin to worship the image of that
[1:35:46] brass serpent. They begin to worship
[1:35:48] that end sign. Amen. until God would
[1:35:51] have to destroy that and they would have
[1:35:53] another insign raised up. Brother Bram
[1:35:55] said the next place it would go was the
[1:35:57] pool of Bethesda. Amen. Where it would
[1:36:00] be raised up again. Amen. In the book of
[1:36:02] 2 Kings 18, the prophet Hezekiah had to
[1:36:05] come and destroy that brass serpent
[1:36:08] because they were worshiping it as an
[1:36:10] idol. Oh, and Brother Brham says it in
[1:36:14] the God rich in mercy. Amen. They begin
[1:36:17] to worship denominations. And I'll say
[1:36:19] this, they begin to worship Brother
[1:36:20] Brandham. They begin to worship the
[1:36:22] image. I mean, the gift that was raised
[1:36:25] up. Brother Brandham said, "Thou hast
[1:36:27] ordained this gift." He said they would,
[1:36:29] he said, "If the brass serpent was here
[1:36:31] today, they would be traveling from all
[1:36:33] over the world to see it." But brother
[1:36:35] Brandham said, "Thou hast ordained this
[1:36:37] gift." Amen. And they're traveling from
[1:36:40] all over the world to see it. Amen. Not
[1:36:42] to Amen. To those that looked with
[1:36:44] understanding, he would say it's not to
[1:36:46] not to lift up a gift, but the gift is
[1:36:48] to vindicate that his presence is here.
[1:36:51] Amen. But they begin to idolize the gift
[1:36:54] and worship the gift. And they begin to
[1:36:56] idolize the brass serpent. And brother
[1:36:58] Bram said, "What we need on the scene
[1:37:00] today is a prophet that will destroy the
[1:37:04] idol of denominations that thinks
[1:37:06] they're going into heaven upon belonging
[1:37:08] to some creed or denomination. it needs
[1:37:10] to be destroyed, burn up and thrown
[1:37:12] away. Amen. Go he begin to show how
[1:37:15] those church ages and mean they were
[1:37:17] begin to idolize them and say I belong
[1:37:19] to this and I belong to that and I
[1:37:22] belong and and this is where I go and
[1:37:25] this and that and brother Brandon said
[1:37:27] we need a prophet and to destroy it. He
[1:37:30] said that might have been good for that
[1:37:32] journey but it's not going to work for
[1:37:33] this journey. Oh glory. I mean, Luther
[1:37:37] was lifted up as an insign for his
[1:37:39] journey. But that's not the end sign for
[1:37:42] today. I mean, the Methodist in sign was
[1:37:44] lifted. The Pentecost in sign was
[1:37:46] lifted. But brother Brandham said, "Oh,
[1:37:48] that a prophet must come to destroy all
[1:37:51] those other images and point us to the
[1:37:55] image for today." And brother Brandham
[1:37:57] said, "God rich in mercy has sent back
[1:37:59] the Holy Spirit upon us and vindicating
[1:38:02] his word tonight as he promised he would
[1:38:04] do. God promised he would do these
[1:38:06] things. Oh, so what do we look to in
[1:38:09] this hour?
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; The prophet did not destroy
[1:38:12] denominations
[1:38:14] without pointing us with to something to
[1:38:16] look to.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham said or the Bible said,
[1:38:20] "Neither shall they say lo here or low
[1:38:23] there, for behold the kingdom of God is
[1:38:27] within you." when he said to the
[1:38:28] disciples, "The day will come where you
[1:38:30] shall desire to see one of the days of
[1:38:32] the Son of Man and you shall not see
[1:38:35] it." I mean, they'll say, "Lo here and
[1:38:38] low there." Oh, glory to God.
[1:38:42] Brother Brand said they'll say, "Lo here
[1:38:44] in the desert, low here in Phoenix."
[1:38:47] Amen. He said they'd get blood in the
[1:38:48] hand. Say, "Lo here. Lo there. Lo here.
[1:38:52] Lo, come to our church. Lo, come to our
[1:38:54] denomination. Lo, look at me. Low. Look
[1:38:57] at this. Low. Look at how many members
[1:38:59] we have. Low. Low. Amen. But brother
[1:39:02] Brandham said, "Don't look low here and
[1:39:04] don't look low there." Amen. But look
[1:39:07] up. And brother Brandon pointed us up.
[1:39:10] Amen. That in 1963 when that cloud
[1:39:12] descended, he said, "That's my Lord up
[1:39:14] there." He said, "Don't look low here or
[1:39:17] don't look low there. But if you want to
[1:39:18] know where to look in this hour, look up
[1:39:21] and see. The Son of Man has descended in
[1:39:24] this age. The son of man is here. Amen.
[1:39:27] He said, "He which has gone up." Amen.
[1:39:30] In a cloud. If you have the picture, you
[1:39:32] can show it. He which went up in the
[1:39:34] cloud shall come again in like manner.
[1:39:37] And as he went up and brother Brand
[1:39:38] said, I saw another mighty angel come
[1:39:41] down from heaven clothed with the cloud.
[1:39:44] He's looking to the right. And the
[1:39:46] inside that was lifted up on Calvary.
[1:39:49] The same way he went up, he came down
[1:39:51] clothed with the cloud. looking to the
[1:39:54] right to pardon and those who would
[1:39:56] receive his pardon and grace. Oh, look
[1:39:59] up friends. The son of man is here. Oh,
[1:40:02] he came from heaven. He came down to
[1:40:05] Calvary. Amen. He came down to the
[1:40:08] regions of the lost. He went up to the
[1:40:10] right hand of God. Oh, but he his body
[1:40:13] is still there. Amen. But his appearing
[1:40:16] has come down clothed with a cloud.
[1:40:19] Amen. What do we lift now? Amen. It
[1:40:22] won't do any good to lift the Baptist
[1:40:24] church now. He's not there. It won't do
[1:40:27] any good to lift the Methodist church
[1:40:28] anymore. He's not there. It won't do any
[1:40:31] good, Amen, to lift Brother Brandham
[1:40:35] anymore as more than a prophet because
[1:40:38] he's not here. He played his role. Amen.
[1:40:40] But if you want to know what to lift in
[1:40:42] this hour, lift up the son of man. Lift
[1:40:45] up the presence of Jesus Christ. lift up
[1:40:48] this message with all of your hearts and
[1:40:50] it'll lift you. Oh my. I mean, you see
[1:40:53] the danger of that deity snake bite. I
[1:40:56] mean, it'll get people to look to the
[1:40:58] future for something that's coming.
[1:41:00] Brother Brandham's going to return. It's
[1:41:02] off in the future, but they're not
[1:41:04] looking the right way. It's a snake
[1:41:06] bite, a deity, devil. Amen. But the
[1:41:09] bride has caught the revelation. Amen.
[1:41:11] That when brother Brandham left the
[1:41:12] scene, I mean, he didn't go with him,
[1:41:15] but he said, "I must decrease that. He
[1:41:17] must increase. Oh, the son of man is
[1:41:20] here. Where is he, brother Ray? He's in
[1:41:23] a bride body. Amen. The son of man
[1:41:26] ministry. Oh, the at the voice of the
[1:41:30] seventh angel. The mystery of God should
[1:41:32] be finished. Amen. Christ is the mystery
[1:41:35] of God revealed. And this great mystery
[1:41:37] which is Christ in you, the hope of
[1:41:40] glory.
[1:41:42] Oh friends, I'm here to lift up Jesus.
[1:41:46] I'm here to have a lifting service.
[1:41:48] Amen. Lift up the message of the hour.
[1:41:51] Amen. Lift up the promises of God. Lift
[1:41:54] up the answer above every problem.
[1:41:57] But you know what? You want you you
[1:41:59] might have to if you're going to have to
[1:42:01] have a lifting service. Amen. We might
[1:42:04] have to have a casting down service
[1:42:06] first. I mean, because that old devil
[1:42:08] was going to be cast down to that lake
[1:42:10] of fire. But the Bible also says,
[1:42:13] "Casting down imaginations and every
[1:42:16] high thing that exaltth itself against
[1:42:19] the knowledge of God, and bringing into
[1:42:21] captivity every thought to the obedience
[1:42:24] of Christ." And it's time, friends, to
[1:42:26] cast it down this morning. It's time to
[1:42:29] cast down every imagination. It's time
[1:42:32] to cast down every reasoning that would
[1:42:34] exalt itself against the word of God.
[1:42:36] It's time to cast down, I mean, every
[1:42:38] devil that's trying to hold you back.
[1:42:40] Amen. from who God is lifting you to be.
[1:42:44] It's time to cast down those thoughts.
[1:42:46] It's time to cast down those murmurings
[1:42:48] and complainings. It's time to cast
[1:42:50] down, Amen. every anxious devil, every
[1:42:53] devil of depression. Amen. Because
[1:42:55] that's where he belongs under our feet
[1:42:58] this morning. Amen. When brother Brandon
[1:43:00] was in South Africa, he said, "Whoever
[1:43:02] will accept him as savior, cast down
[1:43:04] your idols." And he said 30,000 raw
[1:43:06] heathens cast down their idols until it
[1:43:09] was like a dust storm in there. I mean
[1:43:11] from the amount of idols that were cast
[1:43:13] down and my Bible says what agreement at
[1:43:16] the temple of God with idols. Oh, I'm
[1:43:19] telling you every thought contrary to
[1:43:22] this word that's tried to exalt itself
[1:43:24] in your mind and say that you're never
[1:43:26] going to make it and say that your
[1:43:28] children are never going to return. Say
[1:43:30] that you're always going to be this way.
[1:43:32] This is just your makeup. This is who
[1:43:34] you're going to be. I say cast down.
[1:43:36] Amen. Every thought cast down. Let God's
[1:43:40] word be true and every man's word be a
[1:43:42] lie. Amen. Because oh while Satan's
[1:43:45] going down and we're going up. Oh glory.
[1:43:50] You know the Bible says that we would
[1:43:51] look narrowly upon him and say, "Is this
[1:43:54] the guy? Is this the guy that tormented
[1:43:56] us? Is this the guy that kept us up at
[1:43:59] night? Is this the guy? Is this the guy?
[1:44:02] This little fellow.
[1:44:05] Oh, how the tables are going to turn.
[1:44:07] Because you know it's that same devil
[1:44:09] and Goliath that would look upon David
[1:44:11] and say, "You're nothing but a dog. Are
[1:44:14] you the guy that they sent? You're
[1:44:15] ruddy. You're nothing but a a youth." Is
[1:44:17] this the guy? Oh, but what a day it'll
[1:44:20] be. Amen. What a day it'll be. Amen.
[1:44:23] When we look down at that devil in the
[1:44:25] same way that Goliath looked at David
[1:44:26] and say, "Are you the guy? Are you the
[1:44:29] guy that exalted yourself above the word
[1:44:30] of God? Are you the guy that kept me up
[1:44:33] at night? Are you the one that gave me
[1:44:35] nightmares? Are you the one that tried
[1:44:36] to plague my life? Are you the one that
[1:44:38] tried to hold me down? Amen. But now
[1:44:40] you've been a base to a pit of hell, but
[1:44:43] I'm going home to glory. I'm going in a
[1:44:45] rapture. I'm going home. Amen. To be
[1:44:48] with my Lord. Amen. While Satan is going
[1:44:50] down, Amen. We're going up. Oh, this
[1:44:54] world will always take you farther than
[1:44:55] you want to go. Sin will always take you
[1:44:57] farther than than you want to go because
[1:44:59] when the devil is lifted, he destroys
[1:45:02] and he tears down. But when my God is
[1:45:05] lifted, he has the ability to lift.
[1:45:08] Amen. Like he lifted Joseph from the p
[1:45:10] to the palace. Amen. Like he lifted
[1:45:13] Amen. Tamar. Amen. From her position.
[1:45:16] Amen. Toh the lineage of Judah. Like he
[1:45:19] lifted Rahab. Amen. Like he lifted Ruth.
[1:45:22] Like he lifted Esther. Like he lifted
[1:45:24] the prodigal son. Amen. From a Amen.
[1:45:27] rags to riches. Amen. He still has the
[1:45:30] power to lift this morning
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; because I don't care how low you are. If
[1:45:35] you're a son or daughter of God, Amen.
[1:45:37] He will not lose a one of his. Amen. But
[1:45:40] he will lift you out of where you're at.
[1:45:42] And he will draw you unto him. Oh my.
[1:45:46] Brother Brandon talks about that woman
[1:45:48] at the well. Amen. And he talks about
[1:45:51] how God did a transplanting. Oh, he
[1:45:54] said, "If you only knew how close you
[1:45:56] were to the fountain of life, I'd give
[1:45:58] you waters." Amen. That you knew not, I
[1:46:02] would give you waters to draw. Amen.
[1:46:04] That you never thirst again. But I'm
[1:46:06] going to transplant you. Amen. From a
[1:46:08] woman that's been married five times.
[1:46:10] And I'm going to put you, Amen. in
[1:46:12] relationship with the son of man. Amen.
[1:46:15] Where I'll be your husband. I'll be your
[1:46:17] Lord. I'll be your father. And I believe
[1:46:20] we serve a transplanting God this
[1:46:22] morning. He can pluck you up out of your
[1:46:24] sickness, out of your sin, and he'll
[1:46:26] plant you by the rivers of the waters of
[1:46:28] life. Well, you'll never run dry again.
[1:46:31] He'll put you in that veil. Oh, he'll
[1:46:33] put you in that holiest of holies. Amen.
[1:46:36] Where the soundproof room comes on and
[1:46:38] you don't hear that devil no more. You
[1:46:40] don't see that devil no more because he
[1:46:42] said, "If I be lifted up, I will draw
[1:46:45] all men unto me." Why are we lifting it
[1:46:48] this morning? And then because we're
[1:46:50] connected to it. Oh, glory. Amen. You're
[1:46:54] lifting what you're connected to.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because if he's lifted up, he's
[1:46:58] going to draw all those that are
[1:47:00] connected to him. Amen. Like brother Ran
[1:47:03] told that story about that great magnet
[1:47:06] coming through that that room. He said
[1:47:09] it picked up all the pieces, Amen. that
[1:47:11] were connected to it. Amen. But it
[1:47:13] didn't pick up the shavings of aluminum
[1:47:16] because they weren't connected to it.
[1:47:18] Neither did it pick up the iron because
[1:47:20] it was bolted down. But that which was
[1:47:23] connected to it was lifted. Amen. He
[1:47:26] said the greatest magnet is this simple
[1:47:29] gospel today. Amen. And it only picks up
[1:47:33] what's connected to it. Amen. That's why
[1:47:35] it didn't pick up your neighbor. That's
[1:47:37] why it didn't pick up the church member.
[1:47:40] That's why it didn't just pick up the
[1:47:41] denominations or the organizations
[1:47:44] because they were not magnetized to it.
[1:47:46] But brother Brandon said, "The strength
[1:47:48] of this headstone is going through the
[1:47:51] church like a magnet." Amen. That cloud,
[1:47:54] that headship has descended and it's
[1:47:56] going through the church like a magnet
[1:47:59] to pick up his bride from every age.
[1:48:01] Amen. And the denomination stay bolted
[1:48:04] down and the world stays bolted down.
[1:48:06] But to those who are drawn to the
[1:48:08] message of the hour and that great
[1:48:10] magnet has come to lift you up out of
[1:48:13] your condition and draw you on to him.
[1:48:16] If I be lifted up, I will draw those
[1:48:19] that are connected to the word. Oh,
[1:48:22] brother Brand said, that's why there
[1:48:23] always been something different about
[1:48:25] you. That's why since you were a little
[1:48:27] boy or girl, there was always something
[1:48:29] over your life. Amen. That made you
[1:48:31] different that you couldn't fit in with
[1:48:32] the rest of the world. It was because
[1:48:34] you were filtered. Amen. To be
[1:48:36] magnetized to the word and the word of
[1:48:39] and the word alone. Oh, because you
[1:48:42] weren't connected to the world. You were
[1:48:44] connected to a theophony.
[1:48:46] Oh, you are justified and you're already
[1:48:49] glorified. Brother Brandham said that
[1:48:52] old that glorified body is here in the
[1:48:54] building this morning. He said it's like
[1:48:56] that magnet. Amen. That comes and every
[1:48:59] once in a while it charges you and it
[1:49:01] charges you for healing and it charges
[1:49:04] you for deliverance. It's my theophony.
[1:49:06] Amen. And I'm magnetized to it. Amen.
[1:49:09] And it's going to come. Brother Bram
[1:49:10] said those mystic lights which they're
[1:49:13] calling UFOs, they said one of those
[1:49:15] days, one of the light, one of those
[1:49:16] lights is going to come down and pick
[1:49:19] you up and take you back to where you
[1:49:21] came from. Oh, you came from God and you
[1:49:24] came in a humble path. You bypassed your
[1:49:27] theophony. Oh, but that magnet come and
[1:49:31] begin to call your name. And when you
[1:49:33] recognize this message as eagle's food,
[1:49:35] you heard from your theophony and it
[1:49:37] begin to draw you unto him and draw you
[1:49:42] out of your condition. Oh, I'm connected
[1:49:44] to it this morning. I hear it calling
[1:49:47] me. Come up higher. Come up above it
[1:49:49] all. Oh, I'm connected to that absolute.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; I'm connected to this word and this word
[1:49:57] only.
[1:49:59] Brother B said, "God, give us men that
[1:50:00] are connected only to the word
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; because if you're connected to the word
[1:50:06] and a denomination, I mean, you'll never
[1:50:08] be able to properly lift the message of
[1:50:11] the hour because you'll always be
[1:50:13] filtering it through what a man says you
[1:50:14] can preach or what a man says you can do
[1:50:17] or what a man says about this or what a
[1:50:19] man says about that." Amen. But if
[1:50:21] you're connected only to the word, amen,
[1:50:24] then you have the liberty, amen, to lift
[1:50:26] up Jesus Christ, amen, from alpha to
[1:50:29] omega, amen. Amen. You say a balanced
[1:50:31] preacher, amen, should study all these
[1:50:34] people and should study all these books
[1:50:36] and should study all these things. Amen.
[1:50:39] I say no. I say if you want to be a
[1:50:41] balanced preacher, study this Bible from
[1:50:44] Genesis to Revelations and study this
[1:50:46] message from 47 to 65 and preach it in
[1:50:49] the spirit that the prophet preached it.
[1:50:51] And when I'm not looking to be balanced
[1:50:52] according to this world, I say, "God,
[1:50:54] balance me according to the word of
[1:50:57] God." Because Burb said that this simple
[1:51:00] gospel is still the greatest drawing
[1:51:02] card that there is in the world. He said
[1:51:04] if they would get away from just
[1:51:06] preaching theology and creeds and
[1:51:08] dogmas, Amen. And then they just preach
[1:51:10] the simple gospel. It would draw all men
[1:51:14] unto him. I mean, not draw to this
[1:51:17] church, not draw to that church, not
[1:51:20] draw to this denomination, but draw unto
[1:51:22] him. Oh, it's the preaching of this
[1:51:25] message. And it's simplicity that will
[1:51:26] draw this bride. Amen. It's not, Amen.
[1:51:30] We don't draw crowds. Amen. Through
[1:51:32] programs, Amen. We're not looking to
[1:51:34] draw them, Amen. through proceliting.
[1:51:36] We're not looking to draw them, Amen.
[1:51:38] just through a gift or just through
[1:51:40] music. Amen. But we are looking to
[1:51:43] preach the gospel because the word is
[1:51:45] what draws this bride. Amen. Brother
[1:51:48] Bram said, "You might bring more pigs to
[1:51:50] the pen." Amen. But we're not looking to
[1:51:52] bring pigs. We're looking to bring
[1:51:54] eagles. And this word is what's going to
[1:51:56] draw the eagles. Oh, that's what
[1:51:58] attracts this bride. It's the word.
[1:52:01] Amen. I'm thankful for all the other
[1:52:03] things. Amen. But give me the word
[1:52:06] preached in simplicity and power. That's
[1:52:08] what draws my heart. That's when I turn
[1:52:10] on that tape. It starts to draw me out
[1:52:12] of my bad mood. It starts to draw me out
[1:52:15] of my mind battles. It starts to draw me
[1:52:18] because I'm connected to it. And it's
[1:52:20] saying, "Come up higher, my son. Come up
[1:52:23] higher, my daughter. You were not meant
[1:52:25] to live in that cage any longer. I broke
[1:52:28] the door off. Come out of her and come
[1:52:30] into the heavenlies where you belong."
[1:52:33] Oh, preach it in simplicity. Don't water
[1:52:35] it down. Amen. Preach it. Preach Christ.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Testify of Christ. Oh, because
[1:52:42] that's what's going to draw.
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; That's what's going to draw this bride.
[1:52:47] Oh, that's what's going to lift us out
[1:52:48] of this world.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; That's what's going to lift us out of
[1:52:52] our prison. We're not here to put down
[1:52:55] people. We're not here to say you're not
[1:52:57] doing this right. You're not doing that
[1:52:59] right. Brother Bram speaks about how
[1:53:02] that dispensation of legalism,
[1:53:05] Amen, paraphrasing, it ended when Jesus
[1:53:07] died on the cross. Now we have a blood.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Bram said, you say, "If
[1:53:13] you shout, if you if you shout, you've
[1:53:15] got to shout, you've got to dance. If
[1:53:17] you don't shout, something's wrong. If
[1:53:18] you don't dance, something's wrong." He
[1:53:19] said, "That's legalism.
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; If you don't do this, if you don't do
[1:53:22] that, if it's just a bunch of rules and
[1:53:24] regulations, that that's legalism."
[1:53:27] Amen. But if you just preach the power
[1:53:29] of God and its simplicity,
[1:53:33] Amen. And if somebody ever connects to
[1:53:36] that magnet, oh, it'll take care of
[1:53:38] itself, friends. Amen. I believe in
[1:53:41] preaching, modesty, clos line. I believe
[1:53:43] in all those things. Amen. But that that
[1:53:45] that the main thing is that that magnet,
[1:53:48] Amen. connects to that source. Oh, and
[1:53:51] the change will come from the inside
[1:53:53] out. It won't be a man drawing you then.
[1:53:57] Oh, it's the father drawing you home.
[1:54:00] All that the father has given me will
[1:54:01] come to me, but no man can come except
[1:54:03] the father draws him first.
[1:54:06] That's why brother Brandon, brother
[1:54:08] Brandon made alter calls like I think
[1:54:10] nobody I've ever heard. But he didn't
[1:54:12] believe in that old beating them over
[1:54:15] with your mother, your mother did this,
[1:54:18] your mother's going to be so sad and
[1:54:20] this and that. He said it's the word
[1:54:22] that does the drawing.
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So when brother Brandon
[1:54:25] would make his altar calls, it would be
[1:54:28] the preaching of the word would be the
[1:54:30] drawing power that would bring them,
[1:54:34] Amen, to conviction. It's not a man
[1:54:36] drawing you.
[1:54:38] It's not a man. Why are you still here
[1:54:41] this morning? Is it because of a man? Is
[1:54:44] it because Brother Samuel texts you
[1:54:46] every Monday and says, "Hey, don't leave
[1:54:48] this week. Don't don't don't leave. I
[1:54:51] need you to I need you to be here."
[1:54:53] Amen. I need you. I need you to fill a
[1:54:55] seed in the church. No. Just because you
[1:54:58] got a pastor that preaches the message
[1:55:01] and something in you keeps you coming
[1:55:03] back on Thursdays, keeps you coming back
[1:55:05] on Sundays because the father is drawing
[1:55:09] his children onto himself. He's drawing
[1:55:13] them out of the world and drawing them
[1:55:17] unto himself. I mean, we're not here to
[1:55:20] put to put people down. Brother Brandham
[1:55:23] talked about people fussing and fighting
[1:55:25] and said taking communion with each
[1:55:27] other and then getting on the telephone
[1:55:29] and talking bad about this one and
[1:55:30] talking bad about that one. He said he
[1:55:34] now sometimes a prophet gets straighter
[1:55:37] than a lot of us might even do. He said
[1:55:40] if you don't got nothing good to say
[1:55:42] don't say nothing at all. Have you heard
[1:55:45] that before? I mean a prophet's saying
[1:55:47] you're going to be you're going to be
[1:55:49] held accountable for it. Basically, I I
[1:55:51] got the quote. But but you see, that's
[1:55:53] not our attitude, friends, to to put
[1:55:56] this one down. But he said, when you see
[1:55:57] your brother in a ditch,
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; I mean, you put your hand down to lift
[1:56:00] him out and not pick up the phone. Lord,
[1:56:04] help my brother. Lord, help my sister.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; Lord, I don't want to be snake bit.
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be bitter.
[1:56:13] I don't want to be I I don't want to be
[1:56:16] have hatred in my heart. I don't want to
[1:56:18] come to the house of God and sit there
[1:56:20] and I can't seem to draw from the word
[1:56:23] because my heart is so full of other
[1:56:25] things. Oh, but he said that rock oh
[1:56:31] could draw that antidote could draw that
[1:56:34] poison out of a wound.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. That that that rock of ages. Amen.
[1:56:39] When that wound was put on it, it could
[1:56:41] draw the poison out of that wound. And
[1:56:43] he's still here this morning to draw all
[1:56:47] the poison out of your life and lift you
[1:56:50] up and draw you unto him.
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you thankful for it this
[1:56:55] morning?
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't you stand to your feet?
[1:56:59] Amen. It's a deep calling to the deep.
[1:57:01] It's it's it's
[1:57:05] uh it's lifting you above the shadows.
[1:57:08] It's drawing you into his blood that he
[1:57:11] shed on Calvary. It's drawing you out of
[1:57:15] your condition. Brother Brandon would
[1:57:16] say,
[1:57:18] he said it's like a nut and a bolt.
[1:57:22] And he said that
[1:57:25] he said, "See, God is here to thread it
[1:57:27] up.
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; Those those that are here, this is you
[1:57:30] listening at the word that the rest of
[1:57:31] the world thinks is crazy. They are the
[1:57:33] bolt. God is here to thread it up. draw
[1:57:37] you right out of your sickness. It's a
[1:57:40] promise of the word. Just remember,
[1:57:42] it'll start tightening. I will draw
[1:57:44] them. If I be lifted up, I'll draw them.
[1:57:48] He'll draw out of you. He sure will. You
[1:57:52] say, "I feel like I'm at the end of my
[1:57:54] road, Brother Isaac. I feel like if I I
[1:57:57] can't hardly go on another day." Amen.
[1:58:00] But brother Bram said it's at the end of
[1:58:02] the road that there is that real spirit
[1:58:05] of God there to take over that at that
[1:58:07] time and lift you up.
[1:58:09] Amen. When Peter was drowning in the
[1:58:11] waves and said, "Lord, save me or I'll
[1:58:14] perish." And that strong right hand
[1:58:16] lifted down and lifted him out of the
[1:58:19] waves and in the path of duty you might
[1:58:22] fall. And brother Brandon said, "We have
[1:58:24] the same right and desperation to call
[1:58:26] out, Lord, save me or I'll perish. Lord,
[1:58:29] if you don't do something, I'm going to
[1:58:32] perish. Lord, if you don't save me, oh,
[1:58:35] but we serve a lifting God. Nothing else
[1:58:38] can lift. I mean, a denomination might
[1:58:41] lift you temporarily. Amen. But all
[1:58:43] those kingdoms are going to be destroyed
[1:58:45] when God's Eden is fully restored and we
[1:58:49] step out again on this earth in a great
[1:58:52] millennium.
[1:58:53] Amen. But right now, I believe he's here
[1:58:56] to lift us up
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; out of everything that we're going
[1:58:59] through. And then, amen, when we see
[1:59:02] that cloud appear, the Bible will tell
[1:59:04] us to lift up your heads
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; and look up for our redemption drawth
[1:59:09] nigh.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. That is that what you want to do
[1:59:12] this morning?
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Lift up your heads. Amen. Look up.
[1:59:18] Amen. There's a drawing power in the
[1:59:20] building this morning.
[1:59:22] And as they play something, if you just
[1:59:24] close your eyes, bow your heads.
[1:59:33] Amen. Maybe you've been looking at the
[1:59:34] wrong things this morning.
[1:59:37] Maybe your focus hasn't been right. You
[1:59:39] want to say, "Lord,
[1:59:41] help me to set my focus back right. Help
[1:59:44] me to look back to your promises. Lord,
[1:59:46] I've been looking at the struggles. I've
[1:59:48] been looking at the heartaches. Lord,
[1:59:50] help me to look back to your word.
[1:59:54] Focus my eyes, Lord.
[1:59:57] Maybe you've been snake bit this
[1:59:58] morning. You feel like that venom of the
[2:00:02] enem is trying to destroy your life.
[2:00:05] That venom of
[2:00:08] of murmuring and bitterness and no
[2:00:13] respect for authority and
[2:00:17] no respect for headship.
[2:00:21] Oh my maybe that venom tried to get in
[2:00:24] and say this message isn't really the
[2:00:26] truth. Brother Brandham was a good man,
[2:00:28] but but but it's not it's not my
[2:00:31] absolute. It's not I think it's it's
[2:00:34] just another another good man with
[2:00:36] another good ministry. But Amen. Maybe
[2:00:39] it's a Amen. It's a snake bite.
[2:00:43] Amen. That snake bite maybe of fear,
[2:00:46] depression.
[2:00:47] Amen. trying to destroy your life.
[2:00:50] Oh, but he's here to draw you up this
[2:00:52] morning. Say, Lord, I want to come up
[2:00:55] higher this morning. I'm not satisfied
[2:00:58] where I'm at, Lord Jesus. I I'm in a pit
[2:01:01] this morning. I'm in a dark place. I'm
[2:01:03] in a struggle. I'm in a heartache, Lord.
[2:01:06] I want to come up higher.
[2:01:09] Oh, heavenly father, we thank you for
[2:01:12] your grace this morning, Lord Jesus.
[2:01:15] Father, we thank you, Lord, that you
[2:01:17] condescended
[2:01:19] that great son of man, Lord, come down
[2:01:22] out of heaven to take on flesh, Lord.
[2:01:25] And then you went up to Calvary and paid
[2:01:28] the price and rent the veil in two,
[2:01:30] Lord. But you didn't stop there. You
[2:01:32] went up to the right hand where Steven
[2:01:34] saw you lifted up above every
[2:01:37] affliction, every every name, every god,
[2:01:40] everything, Lord. Lord, but you didn't
[2:01:43] even stop there. But Lord, in this age,
[2:01:46] oh, you came again in like manner,
[2:01:48] Father, to draw a bride unto yourself.
[2:01:51] Lord, I believe that magnets's in the
[2:01:52] building this morning. Father, I believe
[2:01:55] the preaching of this message is still a
[2:01:57] magnet today. It may not draw the pigs,
[2:02:00] but Lord, it'll draw the eagles. And
[2:02:02] Lord, that word may be drawing a son or
[2:02:05] daughter this morning. They may be in a
[2:02:07] real struggle. They may be in a real
[2:02:09] heartache, Father. They may be in the
[2:02:11] darkest place they've ever been. And
[2:02:13] Satan's amen fangs are latched in them
[2:02:16] trying to pull him down. But Lord, you
[2:02:18] destroyed, you bruised the head of that
[2:02:20] serpent at Calvary. Father, Amen. You
[2:02:23] didn't just hit it in the foot. You
[2:02:25] didn't just hit it in the leg, but you
[2:02:26] hit it in the head that the rest of the
[2:02:29] body might be destroyed. Amen. That we
[2:02:31] wouldn't have to live under the rule of
[2:02:33] Satan's Eden. But Father, we could be
[2:02:35] lifted up above Satan's Eden and live in
[2:02:38] an Eden of the restored word where the
[2:02:40] message, Amen, comes and cleanses us
[2:02:43] from every contrary thought, from every
[2:02:45] contrary thinking, Lord, this morning.
[2:02:48] Amen. Father, we are having a casting
[2:02:50] down moment, Lord, where we're casting
[2:02:52] down every thought contrary to your
[2:02:54] word. We're casting down our mind
[2:02:57] battles. We're casting down our
[2:02:59] disagreements. We're casting down our
[2:03:01] faults with our brother and our sister.
[2:03:03] We're casting down, Lord, because our
[2:03:05] desire is to be lifted. Our desire is to
[2:03:08] rise with you, Father. We don't want to
[2:03:10] stay where we're at, Lord. We're
[2:03:12] looking, Father, to a body change. We're
[2:03:15] looking to freedom in your presence.
[2:03:17] We're looking, Lord, for our children to
[2:03:19] be filled with the spirit and our
[2:03:21] prodigals to return. Lord, we're
[2:03:23] looking, Lord, for spoken word, Lord, to
[2:03:27] go out and and draw the promise onto,
[2:03:30] Lord, sons and daughters of God who
[2:03:32] speak with authority. Father, we're
[2:03:34] looking for every word in this Bible to
[2:03:36] come to pass, Father. Oh, draw us, Lord.
[2:03:41] Oh, draw us, Lord. We lift you in the
[2:03:43] highest place this morning. We lift you
[2:03:46] at above it all, Father. And we're
[2:03:49] asking, Lord,
[2:03:51] that you help us to lay aside every
[2:03:53] weight. That your drawing power might
[2:03:56] take us into a higher height than we've
[2:03:59] ever been before.
[2:04:01] In the name of Jesus Christ,
[2:04:04] I pray.
[2:04:06] Oh, amen.
[2:04:09] Hallelujah.
[2:04:10] Amen. Do you have something, Brother
[2:04:12] Brian?
[2:04:16] Open the eyes of my heart, Lord.
