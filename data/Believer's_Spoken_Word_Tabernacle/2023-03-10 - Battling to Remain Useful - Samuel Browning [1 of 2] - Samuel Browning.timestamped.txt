[34:14] Lord overtake me
[34:17] amen more of more of you less of me
[34:20] amen
[34:23] my I just
[34:25] I tell you what a privilege it is for us
[34:27] to even
[34:29] be able to come to that place to
[34:31] recognize we need more of him
[34:35] I need you Lord I can't do nothing
[34:37] without you
[34:39] I need you I need more of you
[34:43] that's what real
[34:44] that's what real maturity is about it's
[34:47] it's about us realizing that
[34:49] our dependency on him not that we have
[34:52] become ragdolls because you know with
[34:55] the Ragdoll you can't do nothing
[34:59] but if we yield to him this is the
[35:01] direction he's going we just give our
[35:03] hand to him this way
[35:05] he's going this way we give our hand to
[35:06] him this way
[35:08] remember how brother Branham traumatized
[35:09] it over and over of putting on the
[35:11] jacket
[35:12] he said you take a little boy he can get
[35:14] his arm in one hole but then he'll Spin
[35:17] and spin and spin trying to get his arm
[35:20] in the other hole
[35:22] he said but if we'll just put our hand
[35:24] in his hand
[35:26] he'll guide it into the whole that's
[35:29] what the REM said overcoming
[35:32] [Music]
[35:34] my it's overcoming isn't I am standing
[35:39] out like this no it's surrendering to
[35:41] him and then it's he through us
[35:45] overcoming
[35:47] and we're Overcomers
[35:49] and you know what really you say well
[35:51] how is that he's the one that's
[35:52] overcoming because really what we've had
[35:54] to do in order for him to manifest is to
[35:57] overcome our own will
[35:59] and that's the victory
[36:01] that's what led to Calvary that's where
[36:04] the victory was in Gethsemane
[36:07] that's what brought the unity between
[36:09] God and man once again
[36:11] and that's the same thing not only as it
[36:13] leads us to the new birth but in every
[36:15] aspect of our life is when we can get
[36:18] ourselves out of the way
[36:21] how many know there's a sometimes
[36:23] there's a continual wrestling
[36:25] there's a wrestling it doesn't go away
[36:27] Paul said in Galatians 5 that the flesh
[36:31] lusteth against the spirit capital s
[36:36] then he goes and brings it the other way
[36:38] there's a wrestling that goes on but oh
[36:41] my as we're in his presence
[36:44] it gives us strength
[36:46] we're in contact with him to yield this
[36:50] outer man and yield Our Lives to God
[36:54] amen because really it's not God coming
[36:56] through our flesh it's God operating
[36:58] through that ordained channel in our
[37:01] life
[37:02] that's that soul that come predestinated
[37:04] from God
[37:05] and then it operates it God manifests
[37:08] his will through every other channel of
[37:10] our life we need him
[37:12] we need him I I need him I need him
[37:15] every moment I need for everything that
[37:16] God has called us for we need him
[37:20] amen
[37:22] let's just go to him in prayer heavenly
[37:25] father as we bow our hearts
[37:28] this evening Lord
[37:30] how wonderful it is to be gathered
[37:32] together with the brothers and sisters
[37:34] Lord of like Precious faith
[37:37] and father we pray that God not only in
[37:39] the visible but the invisible audience
[37:41] we ask that God that may your spirit
[37:44] Lord just go forth Lord to minister to
[37:47] our needs
[37:49] for God as we read in your word and we
[37:51] Are Witnesses Lord for we have received
[37:54] of Lord ministering Spirits or God that
[37:57] have been set forth to minister to us

[38:31] for I'm certain that there are things
[38:33] that we lay aside now that God even as

[38:40] we walk out as changed people Lord

[39:08] I want to just read verse 2 and we'll
[39:10] let you be seated I want to remind you

[39:30] Longoria to minister for them and so uh
[39:34] just ask that you just keep us in prayer
[39:35] and we'll certainly be remembering you
[39:37] in prayer that God will just have his
[39:40] way Amen in both in both places so
[39:43] we want to look here into the word of
[39:45] the Lord and also brother Stephen of
[39:47] Bali from Uganda you know brother
[39:50] Stevens a good friend he's been here at
[39:52] the times when he comes to the states he
[39:54] does come through here and so Lord
[39:57] willing next Thursday he'll be in here
[39:59] to minister for us the word of the Lord
[40:01] so just looking forward to that and so
[40:05] we just want to make ourselves
[40:07] him in ready for that amen you're
[40:09] excited for the word
[40:11] amen verse 2 amen can a man be
[40:15] profitable unto God
[40:17] as he that is wise may be profitable
[40:21] unto himself
[40:23] and if I can read one more scripture
[40:26] this is the question remember in life as
[40:29] in there's some few other statements
[40:30] that a life has made regarding this that
[40:33] I read to you some weeks ago
[40:35] and this is an account where God which
[40:39] we're familiar with in verse 8 of Job
[40:41] chapter 1.
[40:43] and the Lord said unto Satan hast thou
[40:46] considered
[40:47] my servant job that's that's a powerful
[40:51] statement
[40:53] for God to be able to call us his
[40:56] servant remember what a servant is it's
[40:59] not a Slave
[41:01] it's one who gives himself up to
[41:04] another's will
[41:06] that's what a servant is when it says in
[41:08] Philippians he took the form of a
[41:10] servant give ourselves up to another's
[41:12] will so hast thou considered my servant
[41:15] job that there is none like him in the
[41:19] earth a perfect and an upright man oh my
[41:23] goodness does that mean that job was
[41:24] Flawless yes and no
[41:29] he was not Flawless in that he was a
[41:32] perfect man where he made no mistakes
[41:35] but he had a perfect sacrifice
[41:39] and job's confession was in the
[41:42] sacrifice
[41:44] if there was anything that came job's
[41:46] way that would somehow take him away
[41:48] from what the sacrifice was saying job
[41:51] quickly went back to where his life
[41:53] could say the same thing the sacrifice
[41:56] was saying that's Grace isn't it
[41:59] he was a perfect and upright man one
[42:01] that feareth God
[42:03] and to skeweth evil that word askeweth
[42:06] means he would depart the evil coming
[42:08] and he would turn from the evil amen may
[42:12] God bless the word as you're being
[42:14] seated tonight I told the brothers I
[42:16] text them and I said you know I I gave
[42:18] him the title
[42:20] some time ago today and a useful life
[42:23] but I said you know hold on I don't know
[42:25] if I'm going to leave that title on
[42:27] there or not you know and sometimes I
[42:29] Can Begin accused of had other brothers
[42:32] of my friends tease me for sometimes the
[42:35] long titles that I would give and I try
[42:36] to be very short with him to be
[42:38] purposeful but that's just how my mind
[42:40] operates but if I could tonight if we
[42:43] think of it and I know they probably
[42:44] already have that there is a useful life
[42:46] but if we could tonight I'd like to just
[42:50] because I know they'll have to title it
[42:51] on the um
[42:53] service later on but maybe brother Brian
[42:56] brother Sean them can write it down and
[42:58] that is remaining
[43:00] useful
[43:03] to the Lord
[43:04] remaining useful because we're talking
[43:07] about a useful life and as these things
[43:10] have just continued to open and unfold
[43:12] here before us I I want to say it in
[43:15] this way I actually at one point had
[43:17] thought maybe I would title it the
[43:19] battle for usefulness and because that
[43:24] still pertains in there because any time
[43:27] and when God uses a vessel Satan is
[43:32] always there to try to hinder it
[43:35] and remember remember what being useful
[43:38] is
[43:39] God he pours himself into our weaknesses
[43:43] he doesn't use our weaknesses but when
[43:46] our use our weaknesses are surrendered
[43:49] to him he pours himself in and then he
[43:54] uses himself
[43:56] and that's how when Paul was received
[43:59] that Revelation from God that my
[44:02] strength when God said to Paul my
[44:04] strength is made perfect in weakness
[44:08] that's on according to our mind and I
[44:11] just say when I say ours I'm including
[44:13] myself
[44:14] that our time of where we feel like that
[44:17] we are of the Apex and the greatest
[44:20] strength is when we feel like we've got
[44:22] everything under control
[44:24] and everything is just right in you know
[44:26] right going just exactly the way it
[44:29] seemingly ought to go and but yet that's
[44:31] the time that where our strength is
[44:33] actually at the maximum
[44:35] but it's when things itself is out of
[44:39] our control
[44:40] it's when the tests and trials it comes
[44:42] through many different ways remember
[44:44] Peter recorded the trials and
[44:47] temptations Peters said manifold
[44:50] Temptations if need be so many that
[44:53] means a variety in how things will come
[44:56] to us and so just to remember it's God
[44:59] using himself and we we want to remain
[45:02] as a useful Channel
[45:04] and that's a battle
[45:06] brother Branham remember as even he
[45:08] stood on the platform
[45:10] it was a battle
[45:12] you remember when the Holy Spirit told
[45:14] him there's a test coming for you
[45:17] warned him now what did Brother Branham
[45:19] do when that test was presented or as
[45:21] far as when God told him that he availed
[45:25] himself
[45:26] in prayer
[45:29] and by availing himself in prayer here
[45:32] in a meeting how this how because God
[45:35] didn't let him know this is what it's
[45:37] going to be God did not let him know the
[45:39] scenario but here right there sitting
[45:42] there on the front row was a young man
[45:44] and a young lady making out right in the
[45:46] service
[45:47] and the Holy Spirit told him said say
[45:50] whatever you will and that's the way it
[45:51] shall be
[45:52] remember brother Branham he spoke to him
[45:54] he says please don't do that into the
[45:56] house of God don't don't do that and
[45:58] he's brother Brahm addresses them on
[45:59] that he did not know that that was the
[46:02] test did not know that was coming but he
[46:04] knew there's a test that's coming to
[46:07] Avail myself and I'll just say it in
[46:09] this way to me if we take from that and
[46:11] I believe when I look through the
[46:13] message of the hour when I'm studying
[46:15] when I am listening I don't just look at
[46:18] things as isolated events like oh let me
[46:20] rehearse this about brother random no I
[46:23] believe God was saying something to you
[46:24] and I that we don't know where a test is
[46:27] coming from but one thing let us Avail
[46:30] ourselves in prayer
[46:33] because that's the only thing that's
[46:35] going to give us the right direction at
[46:37] that moment
[46:39] is being so taken with his presence to
[46:43] where brother random could speak to
[46:45] those and says you know he could have
[46:47] there could have been a consuming of
[46:49] them they went on after what he said and
[46:51] continued to do that but notice the
[46:53] grace of God that swept in there when
[46:56] the prophet said you know I forgive you
[46:58] for that notice God's grace that swept
[47:00] in for the rest of that meeting
[47:02] how powerful it was
[47:06] I think of when we look at this that I
[47:09] come back to this this out of that day
[47:11] at Calvary and I've been you know I've
[47:13] been just drawing from this here for
[47:14] weeks on end and that's just been a a a
[47:17] just a powerful message just going
[47:20] through and I want to go back into that
[47:22] here tonight and just to dwell on these
[47:24] things just a little bit and brother
[47:26] Brown says the first thing I want to say
[47:28] Jesus never lived for himself I want you
[47:32] to think about that tonight what does it
[47:34] mean to live
[47:36] his life was spent for others
[47:39] that's perfectly eternal life
[47:42] when you say you go to church and you do
[47:46] good things that's fine but when you
[47:49] live your life to yourself
[47:51] you haven't
[47:53] eternal life
[47:56] eternal life is living for others
[48:00] it proved it when it come in the Lamb of
[48:02] God he lived and had eternal life
[48:05] because he did not live for himself
[48:09] we're going to look at a few of these
[48:10] things in just a moment he lived for
[48:13] others and you receive eternal life by
[48:17] receiving that day and you don't live
[48:20] for yourself no more you live for others
[48:25] now brother Brahm is immediately going
[48:26] to go into
[48:28] ways that were tested whether we're
[48:31] going to live for ourselves
[48:33] or live for others next paragraph
[48:36] someone said how can you stand to let
[48:39] somebody call you such bad names it's a
[48:42] choice
[48:43] you're going to live for yourself or
[48:45] you're going to live for them that's
[48:46] calling you bad names
[48:48] it's a choice
[48:49] you don't live for yourself you live for
[48:53] others why
[48:55] that you might redeem that man
[48:59] you become sons and the trouble of it is
[49:03] the church has forgot they were Sons I'm
[49:07] glad that there's Grace to take away
[49:09] that Amnesia aren't you
[49:12] you're a son you're taking Christ's
[49:15] place you're a son so don't live for
[49:18] yourself live for others
[49:21] well brother Branham
[49:23] I can live for this brother
[49:25] because he sure is a nice man
[49:28] that's not it
[49:29] I'm going to tell you this here
[49:31] brother Brandon was not just preaching
[49:33] us a message he lived this message and
[49:36] he had to live it time and time and time
[49:38] again
[49:40] because every one of us know that hey
[49:42] that's no problem to live for certain
[49:44] people I mean because why I mean it's
[49:48] just it's smooth it's just it's nice
[49:50] it's velvety it's it's just man it's
[49:54] just we're just going up we're going the
[49:56] same direction there's no ruffling
[49:58] there's no
[50:00] but you know what there wouldn't be any
[50:03] character molded
[50:06] and it's through some of these moments
[50:08] of where the greatest Redemption is
[50:10] released
[50:15] I want you to think of this because we
[50:17] all can identify this I can live for
[50:19] this brother we have no doubt you
[50:20] probably I got the list right now
[50:22] brother Sammy
[50:25] right
[50:26] in your workplace
[50:29] in your family
[50:31] come on now every every family not every
[50:34] every family has and I'm just going to
[50:37] say this every family has some
[50:39] dysfunction
[50:42] even the brownings
[50:50] I say that because Christ is the
[50:52] standard
[50:59] we
[51:00] to live for others so even within family
[51:03] it's easy and family to live for some
[51:06] than it is for others
[51:11] yeah now watch this next statement
[51:14] live for that man
[51:17] who hates you
[51:19] amen amen amen
[51:22] live for that person who would kill you
[51:26] if they could
[51:28] that's what they've done to him they
[51:32] killed him and he died that he might
[51:35] save them
[51:37] that's eternal life
[51:39] and when that's in your bosom you're
[51:43] facing heaven then
[51:45] but you sacrifice your own things and
[51:48] give them up like the sheep gives its
[51:51] wool and you look on towards Calvary so
[51:53] I want to I just thinking and meditating
[51:57] over the weeks and looking at this and
[51:59] really pronounced here how do you live
[52:03] for a person that hates you and would
[52:06] kill you
[52:07] how do you live
[52:10] well I get up of a morning and I put on
[52:12] my clothes and I brush my teeth and I
[52:14] you know I no no
[52:15] it's more than than breathing and eating
[52:19] and everything is to live it's beyond
[52:22] that because we have to do that
[52:25] so it's beyond the things of our natural
[52:28] when when brother Brahm is talking about
[52:30] it's more than just being a human and
[52:32] breathing but it's living with such
[52:34] freedom from our heart where the love of
[52:38] God is dwelling and it's flowing that we
[52:40] could be a Channel of God's mercy and
[52:42] let me tell you it will take nothing
[52:45] less than the presence of God and divine
[52:48] love to make that manifest to live
[52:52] nothing less than that it will take the
[52:56] presence of God of these whole things
[52:58] there's nowhere that I will get to even
[53:00] where uh even tonight and some other
[53:02] things but I will tell you in the
[53:04] battery of quotes that I have here and
[53:06] dealing with all these things there is
[53:08] one common denominator prayer
[53:12] prayer
[53:14] don't ever underestimate prayer brother
[53:17] random called that one of the greatest
[53:18] weapons that God gave us as the Church
[53:21] of the Living God
[53:24] Hallelujah so it's it's being free in
[53:27] other words free from everything that's
[53:30] come to you so you are not responding
[53:33] under the response that has come to you
[53:37] God I don't want to be a reflection of
[53:40] their hatred I want to let the love of
[53:42] God dissolve that let it be like taking
[53:44] the arrows that love can come forth I
[53:48] tell you what that will take more than
[53:51] Humanity
[53:52] that takes God
[53:56] that's what they've done to him
[53:58] he became the sacrifice for their sin
[54:00] once you think of this he sacrificed
[54:03] himself his rights in order to remain a
[54:06] Living Sacrifice
[54:08] I want you to think about this of
[54:10] sacrificing our own things
[54:13] surrendering in his presence you know it
[54:15] could be
[54:16] I know they always you know he kind of
[54:18] joke around that sometimes the people's
[54:20] biggest nerve is the one that leads the
[54:21] pocketbook
[54:22] but but some of the times you know
[54:24] there's a lot sometimes we can be very
[54:26] good in those areas but yet sacrificing
[54:29] our own things is forfeiting our rights
[54:34] we can have a right and be right in what
[54:38] could be done but we have to measure it
[54:41] is that what God would have me to do
[54:45] is that how that I live
[54:50] now you know tonight I'm not just
[54:51] preaching things to you
[54:53] as to preach it as reading it from a
[54:55] label
[54:56] but the things that I preach I've had to
[54:59] live and live
[55:02] you're not looking at a perfect man
[55:03] tonight but you're looking at one who
[55:05] God has given Grace to
[55:08] you're looking at one that has had to
[55:10] and I believe across this audience
[55:11] tonight that's had to wrestle in moments
[55:14] like this
[55:17] and sometimes I haven't had the
[55:19] opportunity just to sit down but I've
[55:21] had to stand up and face it
[55:25] hello
[55:26] now that is and I don't want any I'm not
[55:28] asking for anything from you like Oh
[55:29] Brother Sam you no no what I'm trying to
[55:31] say to you we're in this together
[55:34] right so you see I don't do I don't look
[55:36] down to oh if you only had it like I had
[55:38] and you oh you ought to know how the
[55:39] pastor have no no no no I have my trials
[55:42] you have your trials
[55:43] God does not want my trials to be your
[55:45] trials neither does he need your trials
[55:47] to be my trials
[55:49] trials are personally
[55:52] is orchestrated out like a paper out of
[55:54] a file cabinet oh this is Samuels
[55:58] this is his trial
[56:00] right God God does not say oh you got
[56:03] the white out this was meant for Carlos
[56:04] but I think it'd be good for Samuel
[56:05] white out no no every trial
[56:10] listen
[56:12] predestinated from the hand of God
[56:15] because you know what God knows what
[56:17] lays inside of us and he knows what he's
[56:20] trying to bring out remember Brethren
[56:22] tells us when he talks about trials he's
[56:24] not the author of confusion
[56:33] a sheep you think of a sheep has rights
[56:36] and he can forfeit its rights which is
[56:39] its wool
[56:40] and if it forfeits those rights think
[56:42] about that woo
[56:45] I've had some nice suits that are made
[56:46] out of wool
[56:48] some fine worst of wool right I've had
[56:51] some nice hunting clothes where there's
[56:52] some wool in it it'll
[56:54] Brothers they use Carhartts right wool
[56:58] socks they'll tell you one layer of wool
[57:00] socks
[57:01] I mean not the kind that say wool but
[57:04] you look and it says blend
[57:07] fakes
[57:09] but if you have a hundred percent wool I
[57:11] remember I I wouldn't wear rubber boots
[57:13] when it went into hunting and I know
[57:14] they may not seem very spiritual but
[57:15] just listen to the point about wool I I
[57:17] went into Cabela some years back and it
[57:20] was probably six seven years ago and I
[57:21] said I you know walking back through the
[57:23] I I get tired of getting my feet wet
[57:25] when I walk through water and stuff and
[57:27] they said well try these rubber boots I
[57:29] said but they're only 800 gram of
[57:30] thinsula they said what kind of socks
[57:33] are you wearing oh you know I wear two
[57:35] or three pairs of socks I said but I
[57:37] want my toes when my toes get cold I'm
[57:39] gone I'm inside I don't nothing can warm
[57:41] them up and then what the lady told me
[57:43] all you need is one pair of a hundred
[57:45] percent wool socks
[57:48] she was right about that
[57:50] that's what I have in my hunting bag
[57:52] when I go hunting I have done 100 in the
[57:54] world because the wool pulls the
[57:56] moisture away it does all of that I say
[57:58] it in this manner so you bring it to me
[58:00] when wool had to be surrendered look at
[58:03] the benefit to you and I look at the
[58:06] benefit that sheep is not benefiting
[58:08] from surrendering its rights but I'm
[58:11] benefiting from it
[58:13] the wool that has been surrendered I'm
[58:16] benefiting from that
[58:19] Matthew 5 38.
[58:22] you have heard that it hath been said an
[58:25] eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth I
[58:27] know that might be a family thing
[58:30] right
[58:31] an eye for an eye and a tooth for a
[58:33] tooth
[58:34] but I say unto you and I want you to let
[58:37] me just let me Rook with these
[58:38] scriptures here a minute
[58:40] ah because but I say unto you that you
[58:43] resist not evil now that phrase is where
[58:47] you're not striving
[58:49] against it
[58:51] now let me just work with it here in a
[58:53] minute but whosoever shall Smite be on
[58:56] thy right cheek
[58:58] Square them up
[59:03] right come on now
[59:06] my mother said that don't happen brother
[59:08] Brown tells us explaining the healing of
[59:10] Jairus daughter he said he let somebody
[59:12] call you a hypocrite and he said you
[59:13] want Satan come whisper to your flesh
[59:16] get even with them the flesh Whispers to
[59:18] the spirit get even with him but by the
[59:21] time he gets down there to the soul the
[59:23] soul said Vengeance his mind saith the
[59:25] Lord
[59:26] that's why we
[59:34] were doing starving the white dog it's
[59:37] only feeding the black dog
[59:41] hmm
[59:43] wow but whosoever shall smite thee on
[59:46] thy right cheek turn to him the other
[59:48] also now let me just work with this a
[59:51] minute and if any man will sue thee at
[59:53] the law take away thy coat let him have
[59:56] thy cloak also
[59:58] and whosoever shall compel thee to go a
[1:00:01] mile
[1:00:02] go with him Twain
[1:00:04] give to him that asketh thee and from
[1:00:07] him that would borrow thee turn not thou
[1:00:11] away
[1:00:12] so what is Jesus saying here
[1:00:15] let's balance this out what's he saying
[1:00:18] oh they're suing me I just throw my
[1:00:20] hands up and just give it to him is that
[1:00:22] what he's saying
[1:00:23] don't worry I got a quote
[1:00:26] is that what he's saying
[1:00:28] they're gonna Sue and
[1:00:30] take your straw hands up and say glory
[1:00:32] to God we're going to fulfill it no
[1:00:36] because the Bible also says don't be
[1:00:38] slothful in business
[1:00:41] are you hearing me
[1:00:43] what is Jesus saying here that we would
[1:00:46] resist evil in other words don't come
[1:00:49] under the same vexation that they are
[1:00:54] coming at you with
[1:00:55] Let me Give an example God in Simplicity
[1:00:58] brother Brian stands there when they are
[1:01:00] rededicating the Tabernacle after that
[1:01:02] other portion has been uh built onto and
[1:01:05] brother random makes it clear that he
[1:01:07] said Satan tried to take it by a fire
[1:01:10] the Tabernacle then he said there was a
[1:01:12] man doing work and the man uh made a
[1:01:15] false claim as though he fell and he
[1:01:17] broke his foot or whatever and tried to
[1:01:19] take it away in deceit there's a lot of
[1:01:21] types spiritually there but I want to
[1:01:22] stay with this what brother Brandon was
[1:01:24] dealing with is that the Tabernacle they
[1:01:26] didn't say well we're just going to give
[1:01:29] the Tabernacle up you know we were
[1:01:31] smitten on the right cheek we'll just
[1:01:33] give him the Tabernacle well it is it's
[1:01:35] actually saying it's saying don't come
[1:01:38] under the Same Spirit they are under
[1:01:43] if somebody crosses over on your
[1:01:46] property line you've got laws to protect
[1:01:48] that if somebody does something on your
[1:01:52] job you've got a union you're a part of
[1:01:55] come on Church
[1:01:57] come on then you're not Holier by saying
[1:01:59] well bless God I'm just going to take it
[1:02:01] that ain't being holy
[1:02:03] the scripture is telling us don't come
[1:02:06] under the same fighting antagonistic
[1:02:09] vexation of spirit that they're under
[1:02:12] you can maintain your rights and still
[1:02:15] be a child of God you want an example
[1:02:18] Paul was in a Philippian jail he said
[1:02:20] wait a minute what you've done to me is
[1:02:23] unlawful to be done to a Roman citizens
[1:02:27] I know my right in the bargaining
[1:02:29] contract section 5432
[1:02:32] right see this is scriptural this is
[1:02:35] standing in a balanced way just not
[1:02:38] under their same influence
[1:02:41] Matthew 5 43 now notice you have heard
[1:02:44] that it has been said Thou shalt love
[1:02:47] thy neighbor and hate thine enemy
[1:02:51] but I say unto you love your enemies
[1:02:56] bless them that curse you
[1:02:59] do good to them that hate you
[1:03:02] and pray for them which despitefully use
[1:03:05] you and persecute you ah help me Jesus
[1:03:10] great big help me Jesus
[1:03:12] is that right
[1:03:14] notice these are all notice it's
[1:03:17] Expressions that are counter to what is
[1:03:21] coming our way love your enemies
[1:03:24] bless them they curse you you bless them
[1:03:29] do good to them that hate you
[1:03:32] pray for them that despitefully use you
[1:03:35] and persecute you my mama what are we
[1:03:39] talking about remembering that we're
[1:03:40] Sons
[1:03:42] the church has forgot they are Sons we
[1:03:46] are remembering we are Sons
[1:03:49] amen think about this in verse 45 why
[1:03:52] that you might be the children of your
[1:03:55] father which is in heaven for he maketh
[1:03:59] now notice that you might be the
[1:04:00] children of your father which is in
[1:04:02] heaven so all of that from verse 44 that
[1:04:05] you might be the children of your father
[1:04:07] which is in heaven notice what Jesus is
[1:04:10] saying is not do all of this and then
[1:04:14] you'll be children of God that's not
[1:04:16] what it is we are children of God by the
[1:04:20] spirit of God bringing that new birth in
[1:04:23] our life
[1:04:24] he's talking about the display of our
[1:04:28] sonship the display of of that placement
[1:04:32] of that adoption that we might be the
[1:04:34] children of Our Father which is in
[1:04:36] heaven in other words we are conducting
[1:04:38] ourselves in this earth
[1:04:41] as if we were there already
[1:04:46] by the time you say what do you mean
[1:04:48] when you understand that even in the
[1:04:50] Millennium that there will be those this
[1:04:51] is all the way through the Old Testament
[1:04:53] prophets there will be those Michael
[1:04:55] writes about it Zephaniah Zechariah on
[1:04:57] and on there will be those brother Brown
[1:04:58] pulls it up in the adoption series there
[1:05:00] will be those that will not come up to
[1:05:02] Worship in the Feast of Tabernacles and
[1:05:05] during that time of the Millennium as
[1:05:07] sons of God we will speak out and say
[1:05:09] because you have not come up you will
[1:05:11] receive no rain
[1:05:14] now think about it the Rapture is not
[1:05:16] going to change Us in that way that kind
[1:05:19] of character has got to be molded right
[1:05:21] here right now
[1:05:22] that it's not a vindictive way of you're
[1:05:25] not getting no rain it's letting them
[1:05:27] see the urgency there's no rain because
[1:05:30] you're leaving out the important part
[1:05:32] and that is to assemble at the house of
[1:05:35] worship
[1:05:36] [Applause]
[1:05:38] you fail to assemble you get no rain
[1:05:44] that we might be the children of your
[1:05:46] father which is in heaven brother Sammy
[1:05:48] what are you saying boot camp
[1:05:51] that's where we're in right now Boot
[1:05:52] Camp
[1:05:53] Dylan boot camp
[1:05:56] Hallelujah for he maketh notice for he
[1:05:59] maketh his son to rise only upon those
[1:06:03] that are good and he sends Reign upon
[1:06:06] only those that he likes
[1:06:10] no
[1:06:12] he maketh his son to rise on the evil
[1:06:16] and on the good and sendeth Reign on the
[1:06:19] just and the unjust so you could look
[1:06:21] let's watch this you could look at it
[1:06:23] and say but Lord you're not making a
[1:06:25] difference I'm good they're evil this is
[1:06:29] just and this is unjust but notice God
[1:06:31] himself is not even making a difference
[1:06:35] in the way that he dispels his light and
[1:06:39] the moisture
[1:06:40] you know what he's saying that's the
[1:06:42] call for you and I
[1:06:45] come on now say help me Lord let's Let
[1:06:47] It Drop on down Lord help me not to be a
[1:06:50] sun regulator
[1:06:52] I'm going to give son to brother Shane
[1:06:54] but not brother Dave
[1:06:56] uh buddy I'm going to give you the
[1:06:59] darkness
[1:07:04] [Laughter]
[1:07:06] I'm going to give you some rain you now
[1:07:09] I'm not going to give you no rain
[1:07:11] that's that human sticky part
[1:07:17] and if you belong to God you won't be
[1:07:19] able to get by with that
[1:07:21] you will be miserable matter of fact
[1:07:24] many scriptures I can point to it will
[1:07:26] be tormented until you begin to act the
[1:07:29] right way
[1:07:30] that's scriptures
[1:07:32] so in other words it's not up to me or
[1:07:35] you to decide who gets Sunshine who gets
[1:07:38] rain it comes out upon all
[1:07:41] [Applause]
[1:07:44] so it's not spotty it's selective ground
[1:07:47] but it's surrendering into the hands of
[1:07:50] God and I'll tell you that kind of
[1:07:52] reflection of the Heavenly into the
[1:07:54] Earthly
[1:07:55] that requires a different love than
[1:07:58] human love
[1:07:59] can you say Amen to that
[1:08:02] for if you love them
[1:08:05] which love you
[1:08:08] what reward have you
[1:08:11] do not even the publicans the same
[1:08:15] if you salute your brethren only
[1:08:18] what do you more than others do not even
[1:08:21] the public and so
[1:08:24] but Jesus is saying you're
[1:08:30] you're Ohio you know I can live from
[1:08:32] this brother I can live for this sister
[1:08:34] Jesus said you ain't no different than
[1:08:36] the rest of these religious people
[1:08:39] do the same thing
[1:08:41] but we ought to be as children of our
[1:08:43] heavenly father
[1:08:45] oh I got a right but you forfeit your
[1:08:48] rights
[1:08:54] be you therefore perfect even as your
[1:08:58] father which is in heaven is perfect
[1:09:00] that that word perfect it means to be
[1:09:02] under full development and immaturity I
[1:09:05] tell you I think it's time to throw down
[1:09:06] the kid games
[1:09:08] come on church I think it's time to stop
[1:09:11] acting childish
[1:09:14] but if I don't get my way or if things
[1:09:16] don't go my way then I'm gonna act like
[1:09:18] this it's only display either there's a
[1:09:22] lack of something there or it's not come
[1:09:25] to maturity
[1:09:27] come on when I was a child I dearly
[1:09:30] doubted with things of a child but when
[1:09:32] I became a man I put away childish
[1:09:35] things
[1:09:37] are you hearing me now
[1:09:40] now I want you to watch how brother
[1:09:41] Brown will pray about this and God
[1:09:43] hiding himself in simplicity
[1:09:47] powerful statement
[1:09:48] he said I pray he's praying for the
[1:09:50] people Lord God I pray you'll bless them
[1:09:52] I pray that this very night will find
[1:09:54] the peace of God in each of their hearts
[1:09:56] that they will be so filled with your
[1:09:59] spirit that they'll have faith to
[1:10:02] perform Miracles and the church said
[1:10:04] Faith to live a Godly life
[1:10:07] and to live a life so sweet that when we
[1:10:11] are spoke evil of they speak not back
[1:10:15] evil
[1:10:16] that they can return a kiss for a slap
[1:10:20] now that don't mean
[1:10:24] you know what a kiss is welcoming
[1:10:26] welcoming
[1:10:28] welcoming
[1:10:32] that they can return good for evil
[1:10:37] granted Lord make men to be humble make
[1:10:39] them to come to know you in the power of
[1:10:40] your resurrection and may your death not
[1:10:42] be in vain to us in this generation I
[1:10:44] found that so remarkable let us be so
[1:10:46] filled with your spirit we all would
[1:10:48] take the first two parts to perform
[1:10:49] miracles to live a Godly life thank God
[1:10:52] for that but to notice the then filling
[1:10:54] of that spirit is that we might also be
[1:10:57] able to return good for evil
[1:11:02] now I don't know about you I I
[1:11:03] appreciate that my faith can take a hold
[1:11:06] of this but the times when evil comes I
[1:11:10] don't like
[1:11:13] I don't like that I don't I'm not
[1:11:15] standing up here tonight saying glory to
[1:11:16] God evil has come my way I hate evil
[1:11:21] I hate those types of things you hate to
[1:11:23] be misunderstood you hate those things
[1:11:25] like that not the people you hate those
[1:11:27] types of things but thank God for grace
[1:11:30] that in the midst of it that there is a
[1:11:33] conquering power that we can give
[1:11:35] ourselves to
[1:11:37] so that the evil does not conquer us but
[1:11:40] rather we conquer it
[1:11:44] so there's a real Display of Power
[1:11:46] notice this in First Peter chapter 2
[1:11:48] verse 19. for this is think worthy if a
[1:11:51] man for conscience toward God
[1:11:53] endure grief suffering wrongfully for
[1:11:58] what glory is it if when we be buffeted
[1:12:01] for it your faults you take it patiently
[1:12:04] we've all been there right
[1:12:06] yeah I mean except for everybody all the
[1:12:07] you know well I don't make no mistakes
[1:12:09] brother Samuel that's the biggest
[1:12:10] mistake you made
[1:12:12] I mean what is that when we make a
[1:12:14] mistake or we heir to take that
[1:12:16] patiently that you know there's a part
[1:12:19] of a growing right there but when you do
[1:12:21] well and you suffer for it you take it
[1:12:24] patiently this is acceptable with God
[1:12:29] let me just say this to you God permits
[1:12:33] everything that comes our way
[1:12:43] sometimes we are so we can get so
[1:12:46] perplexed about if this could have been
[1:12:48] this and this wouldn't have done this
[1:12:49] and this then this and this and and
[1:12:51] everything we what we we because you
[1:12:53] know why we don't like trouble
[1:12:56] now I'll just say it again if you like
[1:12:58] trouble you need the Holy Ghost
[1:13:00] because what you've got is trouble in
[1:13:02] your soul
[1:13:03] and you need the Holy Ghost
[1:13:05] but a real believer does not like
[1:13:07] trouble at all
[1:13:10] does not enjoy it does not Delight in it
[1:13:13] not only in receiving it but never to
[1:13:17] inflict it upon others either
[1:13:19] hello but God permits things to come our
[1:13:22] way sometimes it seems so strange and we
[1:13:25] can look and say well if this hadn't
[1:13:26] happened and that happened but God
[1:13:28] permits things you know we don't
[1:13:29] understand the things many times that
[1:13:31] God is working out but any time that God
[1:13:34] permits something to come our way God is
[1:13:38] molding Our Lives
[1:13:40] in Victory
[1:13:44] notice for even here unto you we were
[1:13:47] called
[1:13:48] because Christ also suffered for us
[1:13:50] leaving us an example that we should
[1:13:52] follow his steps so he's our example
[1:13:55] watch this who did no sin
[1:14:00] neither was guile found in his mouth so
[1:14:03] if deceit had been found in his mouth
[1:14:05] such as deceit guile would be to say
[1:14:08] something
[1:14:09] but it'd be different down here
[1:14:11] so there wasn't any deceit in his mouth
[1:14:15] remember David said let the words of my
[1:14:17] mouth and the meditation of my heart be
[1:14:18] acceptable in my sight so neither was
[1:14:20] God found in his mouth who when he was
[1:14:23] reviled
[1:14:26] reviled not again
[1:14:29] when he suffered he threatened not but
[1:14:34] committed himself to him that judgeth
[1:14:37] righteously Allah this whole part this
[1:14:41] right here of committing himself to him
[1:14:43] that judgeth righteously you know what
[1:14:46] he did he took everything that had come
[1:14:48] against him
[1:14:50] and the word committed means is to
[1:14:52] actually deliver oneself into the hands
[1:14:56] of another
[1:14:58] so the Lord Jesus actually he was able
[1:15:01] to deliver himself not just when he
[1:15:05] Lazarus was raised from the grave not
[1:15:07] just when he walked on the water but
[1:15:09] when all of this accusation had come
[1:15:11] against him he was able to deliver
[1:15:13] himself into the hand of him that judges
[1:15:17] righteously now think about it
[1:15:19] everything all the rest of them did even
[1:15:21] when he prayed on the cross for
[1:15:24] forgive him
[1:15:25] they don't know what they're doing
[1:15:30] oh you're talking about Victory and love
[1:15:32] divine
[1:15:33] who his own self bear our sins in his
[1:15:37] body on the tree that we being dead to
[1:15:40] sin should live under righteousness by
[1:15:43] whose Stripes you were healed for we
[1:15:45] were as sheep going astray but are now
[1:15:47] returned unto the shepherd and Bishop of
[1:15:50] your souls
[1:15:51] our brother Rand talks about this in the
[1:15:54] church and its condition
[1:15:57] how many know in the scripture we read I
[1:15:59] think last week we read in the scripture
[1:16:00] in Ephesians 5 where it says grieve not
[1:16:03] the holy spirit of God whereby you are
[1:16:04] sealed
[1:16:06] grief not that that comes down upon us
[1:16:09] grieve not
[1:16:11] now I want you to think of this grieve
[1:16:13] not now notice the dove itself brother
[1:16:16] Brown would put it like this he says now
[1:16:17] just walk meekly quietly humbly gently
[1:16:20] and the dove will lead you but whenever
[1:16:23] you go to listening to that gossip
[1:16:27] well how do you listen to gossip where
[1:16:29] you give an ear to it
[1:16:32] hello
[1:16:34] but when you go to listening to that
[1:16:36] gossip whenever you go to getting that
[1:16:39] temper up whenever you go to thinking
[1:16:41] you've got a right to do this and that
[1:16:43] but God just takes her flight and goes
[1:16:46] on away
[1:16:47] then you don't have it anymore
[1:16:49] and yet here she is she's sitting right
[1:16:51] out there on the limb of Peace waiting
[1:16:52] for your nature to be changed so no
[1:16:55] disgrieve not the holy spirit of God so
[1:16:57] what happens the dove of God just pulls
[1:16:59] back from her life if as a believer
[1:17:02] as a believer I'm telling you you
[1:17:05] recognize when you grieve the spirit of
[1:17:07] God
[1:17:09] that's not a mystery you recognize that
[1:17:11] his presence pulls back from your life
[1:17:14] that
