So I pray, Lord Jesus, you to help us remember that, Lord. Help our faith to not be based on what we see or a doctor's report or maybe if we're praying for a loved one if they get meaner and matter and a hornet meaner in a snake.

In the house of the Lord. And certainly trust that the Lord will just come by our way once again this evening and just just speak to our hearts. God knows our needs. &gt;&gt; He knows what we have need of. Amen. So let's just approach him in a word of prayer here tonight. Heavenly Father, Lord, as we come before you, Lord, and with a heart, Lord, just full of thanksgiving, Lord, no matter, Lord, the conditions, Lord, of life, no matter the circumstances, our hearts are filled with thanksgiving, Lord. Father, even how Paul would direct us by your spirit that Lord even when we would make our petitions known and Lord things that we have on our heart and Lord he would express on to be thankful Lord giving Lord thanks unto you and Lord truly we have so much to be thankful for Lord &gt;&gt; Lord truly if there was not one more thing that you did Lord in our lives when you got a hold of us, Lord, and you melted our hearts down, Lord, and changed us, Lord. Oh, Father, &gt;&gt; that's where there's a real thanksgiving, Lord. &gt;&gt; It's an assurance, Lord, that moves in our hearts that no matter, Lord, the circumstances, Lord, there's a faith that governs, Lord, in our lives. And we're just so want to say thank you, Lord. Thank you for bringing us all together safely tonight, Lord. And I thank you for each and every one, Lord, of my brothers and sisters, Lord. And Father, all the effort and sacrifice that's been made, Lord, to put forth the effort, Lord, in being here. And Lord, we just ask that you would just now just as you're here, Lord. May you come and speak to us, Lord. Minister to our needs, Lord. You know what we have need of, Lord. And may you just, Lord, give to us, Lord. that which is Lord on your heart for this moment Lord. And may we Lord just Lord just be tender Lord just to hear from you Lord what it is that you want to say Lord. We just commit this service into your hands. We ask that you would forgive us Lord for our shortcomings Lord. And Father ask that the presence of God might just move for every need that's gathered here right now Lord. Father, we just commit this service into your hands in the precious name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. God bless you musicians. Amen. Thank you so much. I want to go right into the scripture here this evening. in Galatians chapter 3 and verse 26. Amen. Here in the beginning of the scripture it says for ye all are the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus. For as many of you has as has have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ. Now, we know that there is a water baptism, but the water baptism when we're baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, that's we know that that's a a declaration of a clear conscience towards God. And those are that's where we are are making our identification with him. But then how God comes down and God makes his identification with us is when he does what no man can do and that's he baptizes us into himself. &gt;&gt; You know sometimes where I've asked maybe the deacons or someone else to say could you help me uh maybe to take care of this or so forth. But you know what? God has never pushed placed this on anyone else because no one else could do it. But God is the only one that baptizes and can baptize his children into his body. &gt;&gt; Now, he'll work through his body, but it's all him doing it. &gt;&gt; So, good, &gt;&gt; right? So, there is neither Jew nor Greek. Now, watch how Paul brings this. There is neither Jew nor Greek. There is neither bond nor free. There is neither male nor female. For ye are all one in Christ Jesus. And if you be Christ, then are ye Abraham's seed and hes according to the promise. Amen. May God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated. I want to continue to try to tie up this portion of the thought where we've been looking at here. But um before I get into that, I know that uh perhaps many of you uh if not all have already heard that yesterday evening uh brother Ed Bisll went home to be with the Lord and um such a certainly a gallant a gallant soldier and uh a real witness and testimony uh of the message and um perhaps you know each one of us it's was the Lord that through brother Bisll's life that would touch our hearts in many different ways. um myself uh as I think I expressed that even on Sunday without even um you know you don't know what's coming but I expressed that of even how that uh through some of the services that even I had watched on videotape and how my heart was so encouraged even where certain things as a young man and um certain places and um you know uh messages that brother Bisll would speak. I remember one of the uh being there in the North Carolina camp meeting and one of the um I guess iconic messages he spoke, let us run. I was right there as a boy and um you know not really you know knowing the full impact of things but you know later on when God would really take a hold of my life well that that that message would have a real real significant real meaning. And but I remember sitting in those meetings as a young boy and I remember the prince of God coming down in those meetings in 1986 and how that when brother Bisco also took a message and spoke on the inspiration comes to the inspiraable and uh just speaking of God's inspiration poured out in this generation and uh just so many wonderful things you know and that's just me uh personally among many others um you know and but I so appreciate brother Bisll was certainly uh one that was a real um mission-minded and he had a burden upon his heart. You know, you you'll hear him, brother Brandham will refer to him in many many places in the message. And I appreciate the testimonies that brother Biscll had shared and even in coming into uh the latter years of life when he would uh even go into that of the brown bear and begin to speak of that and he took time and dealt with and dealt with all of that and bringing out that background uh within that time. And you know there was um uh many things when we um you know you look at it I always one thing I always appreciated too about brother Bisco is that because I I certainly believe this that anything we do for the Lord we don't want to do anything less for him than we would do for our own home. &gt;&gt; We want to give 100%. And that's a very thing that brother Bisco everything that was was done and I I don't say that to elevate brother Bisco. just say that that's I believe that that's when God lays on our heart to do something. We just don't want to do something just just anyway. We want to believe God and look to God and know that God is a supplier. God supplies all of our needs and God has a way and he he does those things. And so uh I just always appreciated that appreciate you know the mission that was all those the burden that was set with a real burden was to get the message out. And I certainly believe that that is something that has certainly been able to be accomplished. And so we're just thankful for that. And we want to remember um you know, brother Biscll's family and the church there uh in prayer. And I know that he had been um you know dealing with some things there for for a few years but uh still nonetheless you know that's a real patriarch and there of that assembly and how God used uh brother Bisll within in that assembly to um gather uh those individuals together. As a matter of fact many of them including like brother Tom Ray, brother Tom Ray who's the pastor now. These were individuals who were druggies on the street. And brother Biscoll opened his home and he he actually had a house and he brought all of them together and he and his burden was it was to minister to these young people. And so now these young people are no longer the young people but now they're uh the older ones. But brother Bisco had such of that that burden. Brother Bisco, you know, so many different things that you know you you you see um and you hear within it that was so good. so many uh different things that um I just had received you know just at different times listening to admonition and things like that with ministers and just really one who's been through um a lot of in the journey and just being an encouragement and I I didn't altogether always hear that being there directly to hear him I would have to hear that sometimes by a recording but nonetheless I'm thankful uh because I you know I look to me there's there's other men that I you know that God places in your path and sometimes It's not that I, you know, they won't say too much. Some of the the brothers I would have as mentors, they don't say too much, but I but I've been cute enough to just watch them watch how watch how they approach certain things and and how they go about it. And I'm so thankful that God has has faithful men within within the body. And I'm grateful that God has among us as a believer's faithful one another that we're not just have to look to men or ministry, but it's the same Holy Spirit that challenges our lives to be a reflection and that's the same working of the Holy Spirit in our lives one to another. And so I really believe that with all my heart. And so I just want to say that was just such a uh this morning when uh when I'd received that news and I know it was from yesterday but uh just so many of the different testimonies just coming in on the text thread there today uh from things from how God had used brother Bisco in so many different ways but you know here we are and and we're going to continue on. We we press on towards the coming of the Lord. Um it's sure that you know we're we're very close at at any time and at any any moment um we're certainly living in that time. So we want to take a look here once again in this thought of pursuing uh the right thing. And when we see this within how that Paul would uh lay this out in the scripture, what when we see just looking back at that scripture, Paul would he would have to deal with so many different things that were among the believers uh within that hour. You had as he mentioned in the scripture there, you had Jew, you had Greek, you had bond free, male and female. And God never did away with any of that as far as Jew or Greek or bond or free. As a matter of fact, Paul would even admonish those who would come into the body and maybe they were uh bond or slaves. And it's not how in our terminology or think of it, but many times like even when I've been into the Philippines and other places, they'll have a maid or a house uh attendant servant that just completely focuses on the house and keeping the house and, you know, fixing meals and things like that. and it works for that employment and it just sometimes of being in other countries in that way. And yet Paul would would admonish even the believers to be mindful in that hour even how their attitudes and their thoughts towards one another and to think how God would take as we've been looking at this a gathering and a group of people that is so diverse and so different but God himself would come into every heart into each life and through the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's what unites us together. It's not it's not our backgrounds. A lot of times we can be united by, oh yeah, I've been through that. Oh, I've come through this. Oh, you lived in that area of Lorraine. I lived there, too. Oh, you went to that school. I did, too. Those are backgrounds that we can talk about in fellowship. But yet, there's got to be a deeper fellowship than just the things we have in common upon just this one realm. There's got to be a fellowship that's deeper. Because when there's things that we don't see eye to eye on or we don't see eye to eye with one another and even of those that we might seem to see exactly eye to eye given enough time, sat around long enough, there's things you're going to find that you'll disagree with. And so God God permits all of all of this. And you know, if God wanted to when he gave us the Holy Spirit, he could take every little bit uh and and make every one of us to where we would all think the same way. And you would say, "Well, brother Samuel, that that should really be just a given." If it was a given, then Paul would not have to write an admonishment or Peter and say, "Be of the same mind." &gt;&gt; Where Paul would have to write even in the in the opening of Philippians chapter 4. And he would remind two sisters in the church to to be mindful to be of one mind. And evidently, whatever it was, they were made might have been kind of getting off to themselves, but the spirit of God would call them back into that place. And it didn't mean that we're all thinking the same thing because we're not always going to think the same way. But if we're looking at the same thing and our focus is on the right thing and we're looking and that is him. It's not one another, it's him. And if we're looking to him in all things, then that's what's going to stabilize us and give us the grace that we have need of through the love of God to be able to overlook and not even pay attention and focus on the differences. So when Paul is dealing with this on this on the unity uh within the body and I certainly believe that that's something that's worth pursuing. Paul would write in 1 Corinthians 12 and verse 12 he says for as the body is one and hath many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is Christ. For by one spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free, and have been all made to drink into one spirit. For the body is not one member, but many. And then Paul would go on and say, for we being many are one bread and one body, for we are partakers of that one bread, which does that life. What has made us one is not because we're all a part of the same church. &gt;&gt; It's not because we all everyone even to whatever degree subscribes to believing the message. That's not what makes us one. &gt;&gt; What makes us one is Christ in every individual heart. &gt;&gt; That's what makes us one. And that's what gives the that's what it brings the unity. And then that's where we draw the strength to approach unity with the right perspective. &gt;&gt; When we're not working to get unity in in a in a horizontal realm, the horizontal itself that there is an effect. If we're lined up vertically with God in the right way, then that will have an effect and will even give us the wisdom and the grace, whatever's needed on the horizontal plane. &gt;&gt; But yet all the way through with the scriptures, Paul would admonish this uh by the spirit of God. Ver verse four of Ephesians 4, there is one body and one spirit even as you are called in one hope of your calling. So notice, brother Brandham makes a statement. He says, "When one member suffers, all members suffers." What God is coming to one of these days, brother, is a church without spot or wrinkle. He's coming to a spiritfilled church that divinely love of God so welded to their hearts together that they'll walk as one. Right. &gt;&gt; Not that not that they the oneness is dealing with that they see everything you know that's the great that's the great that shows the greatness of God among us &gt;&gt; is where there can be there can be differences but the differences is not what we focus on &gt;&gt; because there are there we always know that it's just like in your marriage you don't focus on the differences if you focus on the differences pretty soon it's going to become a divide. Right. &gt;&gt; It's it's what it's not just something well you know well this just happens. It happens because things are being focused on differences and let me tell you when differences start to matter. Differences start to matter when you get away from God's presence. The very first thing when you when things start standing out and you find yourself getting a little, you know, critical here or whatever more, that's a sign. Not that the other person, they might be as wrong as wrong can be, but what that's a sign of is you're out of your God-given place. And that is to dwell in the love of God. &gt;&gt; That's why Jude said, "Keep yourselves in the love of God." &gt;&gt; Amen. keep our lives submerged in him in with in in in in in his life. So notice it's this is what God's coming after uh church that spiritfilled divinely love of God so welded uh their hearts together that they'll walk as one. So when you know uh there's many in here different ones that you know uh when the in order to weld or what when things are welded together there's got to be some heat. There's got to be things that that bring two or more parts together. And you know when God it ain't like you know when we look at whether you know it's a fabricated uh moore deck or it's a you know you see beams on a building and you can tell where that weld is at. If you look in those steel buildings you can see where in and the beams sometimes you can look on bridges and you can see where they had to weld those parts together. But when God welds our hearts together it's not something that sticks out like a sore thumb. But what it is, it's Christ in the heart of each individual. And it's actually not us uniting with one another. It's Christ uniting with himself. &gt;&gt; So it's not something that is not all together like standing out as a joint that's been welded, but it is it is manifested in that there are hearts that are united by the love of God. Now I want to just say it in this way that you know this is why that you know in in the presence of God it you know many times as we can come into God's presence and we should but we realize that it's it's got to be more than just us coming to a service or just coming into his presence and you know our thoughts are changed a little bit but it's it's got to come even to a place to where there's evaluation that on. I need there's got to be something deeper if it's not there. Something that's deeper than just a a a feeling, but a but a depth in my life that no matter when I leave out of the presence of one another, that love is abiding in my heart. And that love is what is motivating me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that love what I'm talking about is God. That part of God, the Holy Spirit in our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want you to think of this. Brother Bram says in in here in 1955, he says, "We are brothers. We might disagree upon different things, but we're still brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; We love each other when the love of God is in our hearts. even being enemies, if we have any, which we probably have, but still we love them anyhow because no matter what estate they're in, they're God's children fallen, but they're God's children. Yet, &gt;&gt; I want just I mean just just to meditate on that just a moment. Differences. God even allows differences even as you know you can sit down as I said before and talk long enough. I could sit down with another minister long enough. I've sat down at breakfast and and and and speaking across the table and just, you know, just just establishing fellowship and those things and there can be things that are said and you say, "Brother Samuel, what do you do at that moment?" Well, I'm not there to correct everybody. &gt;&gt; I don't jump to correct people. &gt;&gt; You see, within it, there might be something if we're fellowshipping one pastor to another and I can look at it and they can kind of they can enough to get the hint. I can't go along with that. &gt;&gt; Right. Right &gt;&gt; now, it isn't that I'm right, but I've got to have confidence on where I'm standing because when someone says something, that's where I want to say, well, how how are you drawing that from scripture? &gt;&gt; Do you understand what I'm saying? I I want to know where you're drawing that from scripture. And if you're drawing that from scripture, I want to know where's the quote we're standing on. &gt;&gt; That's good. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because if brother Brandham did not go into that and did not say that I'm not walking after him. We we've been delivered from presuming. &gt;&gt; You see the message the message God brought a message and that prophet. It's not his mind. It's he's that vitro needle that's put on the record to release God's thoughts. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not exalting brother Random, but it's simply recognizing the voice of who it was that spoke through that prophet. Now, if a person wants to stand upon that, we're not I'm not going to argue with that. Let's just go ahead and let's serve God. But you know what? There's a part of it when we should be able to talk about things. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And if talking about things, then we can't have breakfast anymore because of a disagreement. Something's wrong somewhere. Are you hearing me? Something's wrong somewhere. Let me just tell you, you have to fight that tendency within your flesh. Because when the Holy Ghost has come, the love of God is not in your flesh. &gt;&gt; It's not in your spirit. The love of God is in your soul. &gt;&gt; That's why the love of God has got to be in your soul. Because the prophet tells us and Christ revealed in his own word, you can love God and go to hell. because he said by your spirit in the human spirit. People just have a love of God, but it's not a revelation. It's not a real seal of the Holy Spirit. It's not a real love for God, for his word. It's just enamored with a personality, enamored with just his presence and oh, his presence, how it makes me feel. But it's not about it. That's still selfish. But when the love of God is there on the inside, you're there for him. Your your pursuit is for him. Your pursuit your love is for him is for the word. And whatever the word would ask of your life, Lord, so be it in my life. &gt;&gt; That is amen. &gt;&gt; That's a love in our life that no test, no trial can ever overthrow. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's why it's got to be deeper because because just in the spirit realm, it's a wonderful place, but it's got to go deeper. Now I'm speaking that because there can be across the board and how God would encourage every heart, every one of our hearts because I certainly believe if Paul could write through the scriptures under the inspiration of God and admonish the the believers that they he was already seeing God's love expressed through their life. But he would minister to them and and challenge them that it would abound more, that it would increase more. &gt;&gt; So, it shouldn't be that that's a sign. If it's if it's something that's pulling back, something's wrong, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Something's wrong. And and let me just say this. There's nothing wrong. We can we can look at one another, but it's not one another. Right? &gt;&gt; If we're pulling back, it's not because of somebody else. It's because we're living outside of the source of strength that is that we were meant to live by. &gt;&gt; Woo! Man, I didn't know how we were getting here. &gt;&gt; Listen friends, this is where God coming to en encourage us. You might say, "Well, that don't sound very encouraging." But it's to look at, you know, if you approach problems the same way that you've always approached them that it's somebody else, you're going to always get the same results. &gt;&gt; But you've got to recognize as a son and daughter of God. We've got to bring this word into flesh. &gt;&gt; And it's not up to me to do it or you. It's up to us to yield. And if sons and daughters of God are going to rule and reign upon this earth, then we got to start and rule and reign over this part of the earth that we are placed in right now. &gt;&gt; There's no ruling or reigning when we feel good. &gt;&gt; There's no ruling or reigning when everything's going our way. Everybody's thinking our way. Everybody's, you know, just just catering. That's that's that that's not it. But the challenge is when love when divine love will really show itself is when everything else around us is not going our way. &gt;&gt; And I'm not even talking about in disagreements. I'm talking about even in those moments where we don't feel like it or the conditions are not present &gt;&gt; that make us feel loving. &gt;&gt; How many thankful for the love of God? Now watch, I read this scripture to you last week, but I want to move from here and and jump forward. Paul is writing to them at Lady Oia at the churches there in Asia Minor and he said that his he he that their hearts verse two might be comforted, encouraged, being knit together in love. If there ever was an hour and a time that we need encourage, we need encouragement. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? We need every one of us need encouragement. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you just don't you don't realize the the pressures of things that that that that people can be going through. And it's not about you know you you uh discerning that or or thinking of it's just to realize as a body just as much as you would take care of your body and you would supply certain things that are needed. You know certain things are needed. Sometimes you do things without it even having to be thought. You you you think about when you're at the store, I'm going to buy things for lunch. You think you go you go to the store, we've got to we've got to provide, you know, for this for for dinner, one or more. You're thinking ahead, &gt;&gt; right? You're thinking of your own body. Of course, your family as well, too. But that's the same thing, but in a greater way for us as a body of believers that that God would would desire to minister through to through us to one another encouragement. Anybody ever been discouraged? &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Sometimes sometimes the discouragement can come even from the toils of life. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Just just from the pressure just from not even when maybe approaching certain things you know as a family or one or more how do I approach this? How do I go about this? And sometimes you're you're waiting you're praying and you're looking to go for an answer. You know, the Bible tells us in the book of Galatians, "Be not weary in welloing." &gt;&gt; For if we faint not, we shall reap. &gt;&gt; Oh God, if there's ever an hour that we need that encouragement and strength, oh God, let that encouragement, it's not going to come from out there. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm not knocking anybody from out there, but I'm saying that God has put this body together. That encouragement should be a vital part in the body. Amen. &gt;&gt; Sure, we we can have, you know, you have different ones and you know, I've had people even when I was working, well, you you ought to go do this, Sam. You ought to go do this. You'll be good at this. You'll be fine at this. You'll be good at this. You'll be good at that. But you know what's different with all that? It's all things that is encouraging based on what can just be seen with a carnal carnal understanding. It's not something that's spiritual. &gt;&gt; That's why we want to be careful even what we're encouraging. We don't want to we don't want to encourage someone out of the will of God. Just look at this. Being knit together in love and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding to the acknowledgment of the mystery of God and of the Father and of Christ, in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. &gt;&gt; That's good. Why would Satan want disunityity? &gt;&gt; I mean, let's just go the opposite brother Brandham did in the church age book when when it said bringing out the revelations, thou hast not known the depths of Satan. Brother Brham says, how we understand it is go back to see what is the depths of God. So to think within this, why would Satan want disunityity? Why would he battle against this? Because it's through when unity is there and it doesn't you know when you have to press through and unity because here what leads what comes from that in unity is God unveiling more of himself not only to us but in us and through us. &gt;&gt; We grow in these times. Listen to me now. It's wonderful as we come to the house of God. But your growth is not altogether here. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; You're admonished by the ministering of the word. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; The word will point out areas in our life as Christ comes. Oh, this is where I need to be given my attention to. You know how it is when you sit down and you might think certain things are important, but God comes back around or in a group of individuals who sat down and you realize what you're looking at and are tunnel visioned on is really not what we need to be tunnel visioned on. and God will bring our attention to what we need to give ourselves to. And it doesn't when we give ourselves to it, that's the start of yielding to it and saying amen to the word of God. And when we're yielding and saying amen to the word of God, then God can begin to deal with our life and we can begin to see as Paul is pointing out right here, there's an assurance of understanding. What's happening when our hearts are are knitted together in love? There's an assurance of understanding. You know where you where you're standing. You know where you're standing. &gt;&gt; It's when things get out of line in a person's life &gt;&gt; that causes them to get indifferent with somebody else. &gt;&gt; It's not the other person. &gt;&gt; It's okay if you don't say, "Amen. I'm just going to I'm just dropping this in here tonight. It's this is this is this is this is meat on the bones. Yes, it is. &gt;&gt; These are things that when through that, you know, when let me just tell you when you know you're you're in fellowship with God, there's nothing between you and God. There's nothing in your heart. There's no unforgiven. There's no grudge. Everything is cleared out. Everything is clean. You know where you're standing. You're open. You're available. And you know what? There is a strength. There is a strength of God's love operating in your life. It doesn't matter what comes your way. Where you're drawing your strength from is from him. &gt;&gt; Really good. &gt;&gt; See, I'm not we're not putting this to highlight Jew or Greek, bond or free, male or female. Well, I have to be this brother. I have to. No. No. Every one of us have access in the body that we have been baptized into. &gt;&gt; Every one of us have access if we're in the body and the love of God is in our hearts. &gt;&gt; Amen. unto I wish I had more time to spend on that to the acknowledgment of the mystery of God of the Father and of Christ. To be able to recognize Christ in your life to be able to see him working in your life to know what his expectation is of our lives. Surely he didn't save us and fill us with the Holy Ghost that we would just sit around. &gt;&gt; And you understand what I mean by sit around. I mean to where we become complacent. But that's not it don't work that way. The prophet said in stature of a perfect man the opening quotes he said anyone who has ever come in contact with God and in part of his divine nature you can't get enough of him. You want to know more about him that you might become more like him. &gt;&gt; And brother Random uses an example. He said it's like I told my wife. He said that I love her so much. I just like the puller inside of me to be that much more closer. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; There's a desire. I want to be more like him. &gt;&gt; Is that your desire? &gt;&gt; I I want I want his life, his patience. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; His virtue, his temperance, &gt;&gt; his life, his godliness. I want that. That's that's that's that's what we're called to in this hour. You may never walk on the water. Don't let that become your ambition. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's why Paul said, "Though I speak with tongue and men angels," he wasn't diminishing anything as we've been saying. What he was saying is is the right thing to be focused on that actually gives value to any gift &gt;&gt; is the love of God. &gt;&gt; Notice as Paul would write here, think about this. knitted together. Paul wrote in another place, tempered together. Now watch this. As a body as we refer to this as a body and Paul speaking of this of why he would give the ministry to we all come in the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. Now see God God works. He starts from the foundation of faith of supernatural revelation by the new birth. And God builds his church as he builds every individual. And God is bringing us all growing up into Christ in all things. Now, where do those things come? Brother Brandon will spin all the way the countless number of times and he'll refer back, you know, to stature of perfect man and blasphemous names as a real key. and he opened these things. He says, "You don't put peacock feathers in a blackbird." &gt;&gt; He said, "You first must be born again. Then those feathers come out on their own &gt;&gt; as we will yield to that." So, it's Christ working in our life bringing there's a maturity and in this hour, this is the hour of sons and daughters of God to come into full adoption. This is the hour for the capstone itself to set down in rapturing grace. I know we're under the effect of it, but when that capstone absolutely sets down, not in symbol form, but when it sets down, the rapture goes, &gt;&gt; we've received a capstone revelation to bring us what? into position into condition to mature the church of the living God and to draw us up unto him in all things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know that those are not my words. That's the prophet's word. He said when that capstone when this church has finally come to its place, the capstone sets and up we go in rapture. So I want you to think of this here in Ephesians 4:15, brother Ram or Paul says, "But speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things. Growth is not overnight, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It's not overnight. &gt;&gt; But growth is ongoing." Let me just say this to you right now. No matter where you're at, you've never come to an end of growing in your patience. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; You've never come to an end of growing in virtue. &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, your faith, Brother Samuel, your faith, yeah, Paul pointed out in in the Thessalonian church, your faith aboundeth. &gt;&gt; See your faith, that's why brother Bram 1965, wings of a snow white dove in prayer. Oh God, those seven angels that descended there that morning. Oh, what has dropped from that revelation has led me to a faith I never had before. &gt;&gt; See, his faith was growing. &gt;&gt; Growing by what? It wasn't the things that was going on, but it was how God had revealed himself and making himself known. And the prophet experiencing that in in his own life, it brought him to that place. Same thing with patience. Same thing with virtue. Same thing with temperance. Same thing with all these. It continues to grow. But I just want to stay focused here on this with of this of the love of God and the body. And I want you to watch how this is mentioned which is the head even Christ. So we're under his under his leadership. It's it's God that is cultivating our lives. It's God that's working on our lives. When you plant, look at even what I had. We planted out here last year and we went and planted this out here, rolled out the black tarp and we put that out and we begin to plant those plants. I'm going to tell you, I'm glad that we did it because when I go around and take take a little break of a day, I want to go around and check the plants. I check for weeds. Let me just tell you something about weeds. You find this at your own home. I have found weeds. How I how this happens, I can't explain it. But I have found weeds that look like hydrangeia plants, &gt;&gt; the leaves. And I start looking them and when I look, I keep walking by and I think that don't look the same. Something's different. I start looking. Weeds can come up so subtly. &gt;&gt; I've watched this. I've watched it when it comes to my roses. I've watched it when it comes even right out here. How that happens, I don't know. It would be easy if they had all stood out like a sore thumb. But you have to go around. You have to inspect. You have to even loosen up the soil. But even with weeds that I've went and pulled, and I know some of the other brothers have have done some of the things, they just thankfully they did pull up pretty easy. But there's an ongoing keeping of that bed. If it wasn't kept or around your house, eventually the weeds would take over. All right. &gt;&gt; This is why that within that within that garden, within the bed, within our lives, it's something that's to be tended to that Christ will remain preeminent in our lives and our lives do not become full of weeds. &gt;&gt; We're gardeners, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Adam was a gardener. &gt;&gt; Christ himself a gardener. So notice, from whom the whole body fitly joined together, and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love. So the body you think about this when this within the body there is so much connective tissue in the body and one of the one of the things that is spoke of right here is how that every joint supply and you know when joints that's where a lot of times where arthritis will set in something has affected in that whether it's your knees your hips your back. It's places where there's multiple things that come together. And those joints, all those parts, it's not just the joint that holds those bones together, but there's tendons, tendons, there's ligaments, there's there's even tissue that you know that connective tissue within our body that we can say, I want to get rid of all the fat. You can't. Some of you going to be blessed by this. You need a certain measure of fat. Yeah, &gt;&gt; some of that connective tissue keeps vital organs in their place. &gt;&gt; You see, some things that we're we can try so hard and we don't even think about. We're thinking about this bone or thinking about that, but that bone would not even and the muscle and everything, you know, it needs the muscles to move. The bone don't move on its own, but there has to be the connective tissues. And you know what says to my feet to move here and even how even walking downstairs or anything we've committed that many times to subconscious you know where all of that has originated the movements it's not my foot that's telling my brain to move it's the head that's giving the direction to the body &gt;&gt; right and if something gets out of line maybe something kind of deadens that for a little bit I never forget the time that you know I think it was back in 2006 when I woke up on that um uh Sunday morning and I couldn't even sit. Uh there was such fire that was going right down my leg. I couldn't sit. I just walked back there. I couldn't even set in the in the car. I had to ride in the back here so I could preach and kneel. And then I got home. I couldn't even set. I couldn't set at all. Finally that night, I I I I just put my I pushed right here against my hip. And when I did, I was able to go eventually go to sleep. But when I woke up the next morning, I had a gate in this foot. The foot was just that was scary. &gt;&gt; I thought me, I was going to get on a road on on on the treadmill and I'm going to run it out. That was a sight to see. You see what happened when that way that way that took place. But you know what? What would happen? And obviously it did. Everything came back. the feeling within it. The doctor when I went to him, you know, I told him that that day when I went, it was fire going down my down my leg. I had to drive the doctor. Oh, I was just weeping cuz it was it was like fire. It felt like I was standing in fire going down my leg. And he said, Sam, he said, there's many different athletes that get that. He said, and different ones, he said, it'll come back. Now, I appreciate good doctors &gt;&gt; and our ultimate trust is in the Lord. But what I'm trying to say is is that because something had taken place in there, which is from the sciotic nerve and all of that coming down there, it had affected the way that I was walking. But I had to get that back. &gt;&gt; And sometimes the things that when we're looking at our life, we experience difficulties, we experience hurt, you experience disappointment, you experience things. That's what has come is to try to cut off and try to hinder. But listen, God has called you for a purpose. &gt;&gt; And you can't lose sight of that purpose. And that purpose is to serve him. &gt;&gt; That's how you have to look beyond your disappointments. And when conditions are no longer the right kind of conditions or the feel-good conditions, we've got to look beyond that. And that takes the grace of God. &gt;&gt; That's true. Listen friends, there's nobody, you know, well, well, I know this person, they're a strong fortitude. It's got to be more than a strong fortitude of mind. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; It's got to be more than that. So, this this this tissue that would connect the body together. And what we're dealing with is how the love of God is what brings the body together. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, &gt;&gt; it's the love of God. That's why why that allows it to be flexible, to be moved, to be moved upon, and for the Holy Spirit to move throughout the body. Let me just tell you something. If my hand or my foot decides that, you know what, I'm not going to do this. It's still a part of the body, it may decide, I'm not doing this. I don't want to do this. What it's doing is it's hindering the rest of the body. &gt;&gt; That's why everything has got to be checked. every motive, every attitude and it has to come back away from me and back on Christ and his body, his body, every decision, things that are done should be about the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's victory, friends. That's overcoming. We talk about the lion's den. How much how great that that's that's that is a a testimony for God's grace in our life. Surely our feelings, God, the power of God is able to put our feelings in subjection. &gt;&gt; Should we have feelings? You should. &gt;&gt; Without feelings, we would be a terrible people. &gt;&gt; It'd be terrible if we didn't have feelings. It'd be like different ones. Even I've talked to uh different ones that said, you know, they didn't have any taste. Still, Lord, I'm glad I got taste. I'm I'm just I'm not I'm just saying I'm really thankful. I'm glad I got taste. I'm glad I can taste my food. I'm glad I can taste my coffee. &gt;&gt; I mean, I I never never had lost that, but I I'm thankful to God for that. &gt;&gt; Because when you lose some sort of a feeling, my that's a dangerous situation. But notice if it's the head itself that would absolutely control everything. I want to read this scripture here and then let me just try to tie some things together. The Bible says, "And above all these things, put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness, and above," in the amplified version, "And above all these, put on love and enfold yourselves with the bond of perfectness, which binds everything together completely in ideal harmony." You notice the scriptures even from last week and this week coming into this of where is coming down to it what joins us and unites us together is the love of God. &gt;&gt; It's the love of God that holds us holds us together. It's the love of God in our heart that that love of God when it's in our heart it cannot be overthrown. &gt;&gt; Disappointed. Yes. discouraged, yes. Cast down, yes, but not forsaken. &gt;&gt; Right? The love of God cannot be overthrown. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It doesn't fail. Remember we preached on that charity never faileth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When charity, when the love of God is even the pursuit in our lives, no matter what rises, pursue, follow after charity. And I'll tell you had to deal with some things and you know other times and the person said you know I I called them don't worry they don't go here they didn't go here and I begin to just talk and you know just working with a person working with the individual and then you know I have a call you know that you know from somebody else and you know that kind of involved with something or what more and I just said you know and just trying to reach this and trying to reach reach out to for this and and and so forth. I don't want to get into any any specifics, but I remember as the individual said, "Well, I don't feel too loving right now." I appreciated him being honest with me. &gt;&gt; I don't feel too loving, &gt;&gt; fellow brother in the Lord. But I knew I knew what it was is that the situation and what was present was like a gut punch. &gt;&gt; And that gut punch that came up, they were simply being honest. They were not discrediting that the love of God was not needed. But what they were witnessing and before them and now having to deal with, they knew it was going to take a great supernatural work of the Holy Spirit from within their hearts. And let me just tell you something. I witnessed God do that &gt;&gt; for the whole situation. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; I witnessed God do that. to witness God move within such a supernatural way. That's why friends when we stand here that there's nothing that's beyond God if our hearts are willing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If our hearts are willing, I say, God, make our hearts willing. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; This is the bond. This is this is what holds everything together, &gt;&gt; not how many miracles we have. Not how much faith we have. &gt;&gt; Charity, &gt;&gt; the love of God is what holds everything together. &gt;&gt; Do we do we believe in miracles? We do. Do we need M? We need, you know, when you're standing in need. But this is what holds together. &gt;&gt; That's right. Now I want to just come into this on this scripture because it's putting on it's sinking into and certainly like a garment the love of God in our soul is more than where we can sink into the love of God. Lord I want more. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the first place of starting that I want more is recognizing not only my need, but there's some things, Lord, that I'm seeing that's causing me to say I need more of you. Now, we're going to have feelings, but I don't want them feelings being preeminent. &gt;&gt; Not excuses for them, &gt;&gt; not making place for them, but calling them out for where they are. And when we can come to that place, then it allows God to move in a greater way. Why? Because we're being honest. &gt;&gt; We're being honest because just to say, "Lord, I need more of you." Actually, it's we dying more to self and more of his love. Us sinking more into him. &gt;&gt; Now, watch this. Brother Brandham takes this and I I'm just gonna just kind of jump to this point here. Brother Bram takes in in blasphemous names and he's dealing with brotherly kindness which is the the word and what God has given even to this hour. And when brother Bram comes into this, he's going through a dream that Sister Shepherd had a year prior. And in her dream, she was wondering whether she had the Holy Ghost. And in this dream, I remember a prophet receives it. In this dream, she saw a man standing here and you have this rock box. And the rock box, it's got, you know, a rock box, it's got holes in it. It's like almost like a crate. And here was a great man, the prophet interprets it, the messenger of the age, pouring into that rock box, the revelation of the hour. And through that rock box, the revelation, the Holy Spirit pouring down through there, that rock box could not hold that. And brother Brandham interprets that. He said, "That's why there's no such thing as a Holy Ghost church." He said inside of a church you can have you got people that are spiritfilled. You you have renegades and on and on. He goes all through the whole thing because what it is is the spirit of God is come to seal. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; And so brother Brandon was talking about how that's poured down. He said she was wondering does she have the Holy Ghost? And he said these five streams of grace, five streams of water came down and it ran over her feet. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he said what that is, he said, is that her faith that had started out to believe God, intellectual faith, but when the Holy Spirit hit that faith, it's a spiritual revelation upon this rock. I will build my church. I'll build my individuals. And brother Bam deals with that and and and and and places that there showing her where she's at as well as the Holy Spirit that's been coming down through. And the Holy Spirit, he's sealing he they're bringing new birth, new creation to his children. Everybody okay on that? But then in the dream, the same messenger, because this is where we're at, he has a bucket of honey and he pours in the honey. And when he pours in the honey, remember the water would not stick. The water just runs through and seals &gt;&gt; those that are to be sealed. But the honey when it's poured in, remember what was said, this will stick. Right? &gt;&gt; Just stay with me a minute. &gt;&gt; Stick in terms of what? Remember this is the age they without us cannot be made perfect. &gt;&gt; It's this in this hour the love of God, brotherly kindness being poured that will seal the whole entire church of the living God together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It makes it stick. The prophet said it's a seal that seals all the ages together &gt;&gt; in this age. That's why they are without us cannot be made perfect. Now listen, &gt;&gt; brother Brand then brings that now brings it into a practical measure where we see brotherly kindness in our own lives. And he says, "Now the honey represented brotherly love, brotherly kindness, which is this age." He said, "I just got through telling you of brotherly kindness, the age that we live in now." Now you might say, "Look, I sure don't like Brother Neville. I sure don't like brother Jones. I don't like brother so and so and something like that. But just let something happen to him, brother. Your heart is broke. &gt;&gt; It just nearly killed you. See, we can obtain brotherly kindness and feeling for one another. &gt;&gt; Did you catch what he was saying here? Oh, I may not like this. I may not like that one. He didn't say not love them. This is not this is not footnotes to take and say, "You know what? This gives me the right for a grudge." &gt;&gt; Or, "You know what? This gives me the right to live on my own little island. This is not This is not what gives us the right to say, you know what? I don't like anybody here at this church. I'll go find another one." You find another one, you'll find out. &gt;&gt; You'll find out eventually. Give it time there and eventually it'll be the same way. And you begin to realize it's not people. &gt;&gt; Yes, there's all humanity that's here, but every one of us have a part in it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not saying that to hold anybody here. I'm just trying to say that we all have the humanness which within it. And it's not everything that we in our own selves, we're walking around as the absolute. And everything I've done is perfect. And everywhere I go, it's just thus sayith the Lord. For every step I take and and the pillar of fire is always on me. and I'm eating donuts with the angels every morning. That's not true. &gt;&gt; It's not true. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham didn't even talk like that. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Brother Brandham had to deal with things even in his own life. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I can take you through year after year after year after year where he would say, "I I am determined never to have another negative thought again." 1956. Come around to 1960 and he would say the same thing again. You know why? It was an ongoing work in his life because humanity all around challenged that &gt;&gt; because one sure thing if we're walking with God as we say we're walking then we'll act like God &gt;&gt; we'll live like God &gt;&gt; and we won't be taking the he found in the temple those who sold merchandise going around and kicking this over and tipping this over and tipping that well I'm acting like Jesus. We can obtain brotherly kindness and feeling for one another. We can obtain that. &gt;&gt; How many believe that? &gt;&gt; Well, brother Samuel, I already have that. But there's more. &gt;&gt; There's more. &gt;&gt; What about for those that you don't like or your personality just doesn't dovetail with? Well, brother Samuel, I stay away from that. I'm going to read the rest of this quote in just a moment. &gt;&gt; If we've got to stay here till 10:30, I'm going to read the rest of this quote. &gt;&gt; This is not about putting us down. It's God wanting us to grow up into him in all things. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. Amen. &gt;&gt; But to maintain in a group of people. Notice how brother Ram says that there he makes this statement to maintain it in a group of people. Why? Because in a group of people you have people that here have been sealed and you have others that are in journey &gt;&gt; to be fully converted sealed. &gt;&gt; Let's just let let me say this. Then you'll have others they'll never come to it whatsoever. Now listen, brother Bam tells us in every kind, every gathering, there's three kinds of believers. &gt;&gt; And brother Samuel, why do you preach as though everyone will? Because I don't know who is &gt;&gt; and who's not. And that's what I love. I love to hold that for each one. Well, you might be holding wrong. I'm never holding wrong. I'm never holding wrong. I've never ever I never felt like, oh, I wasted time by trying to encourage this one. I have never wasted any time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; So within all of that, here we stand. But wouldn't wouldn't it be incredible? Brother Ram says it. He says it like this in 1954 question Answers. He said, "If all the veil could be taken down, every one of us would be filled with the spirit of God. There'd be no arguments among us, no disagreements among us." Now, what is Brother saying? Is it that we're all all of a sudden always going to be able we're always going to see everything eye to eye? That's not what he's saying at all. But what he's saying is is that there would not be any lasting divisions. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; You see, we can sit right here, but we shouldn't sit here and have foxholes between us. &gt;&gt; Well, I've got my trench right here. We It shouldn't be that way. Brother Samuel, what do I do about it? Let me ask you, what did God do about it for your life? &gt;&gt; You and I were enemies unto him. &gt;&gt; Matter of fact, the prophet says unlovable like the scriptures. &gt;&gt; We did not merit the love of God. Right. &gt;&gt; But if the love of God is in our heart, there is a strength, a hidden power in our life that unites us with one another even above every dislike, above every disagreement, above every fault, above every mistake, above all of that. It's the love of God because we know even in our own lives, we are standing in need of the mercy of Almighty God. But to maintain it in a group, that's this is the this is the challenge. Now, brother Rab says, "Why do you care for that brother?" Because you broke bread with him here at the altar as you will tonight. You fellowship with him. You shook his hands. You worship with him. He's your brother. And he might do something in the flesh that you would disagree with. Cause you just kind of stay, which you ought to do, but shun him a little bit. I may say, "Help me, Lord." &gt;&gt; You know what would cause you to do that? To say, "Help me, Lord." The same as it would me because it's the head drawing upon our lives. He's wanting to draw us up more into himself. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; And you know where the first it all starts with is Lord, help me. &gt;&gt; Help me, Lord. See, God isn't condemning. It's here to grow. Now, others could say, "Ah, that isn't even needed. That isn't even necessary. Bless God. We're right in the midst of revival and faith and works and every But if there's no love, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; If it's division, &gt;&gt; sometimes division can be sown by statements that can be made to exclude our church. What we believe statements that can be said that actually divide. And what I find is is when this is where I look at many of these things. I look when I look for these things, friends, where I look at with studying the message, I look and I look at things and I think brother Brandham never even made statements that way. Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham never made certain definitive statements that would actually cause brethren like that to just separate. As a matter of fact, it was quite the contrary. Brother Brandham never compromised in his doctrine, but brother Brandham would minister and preach the word to unify the people together. Why? Knowing that there were hearts within there that were ordained to eternal life, but in the bottom of your heart, if something happened to that brother, it would just nearly kill you or that sister. Brother Ram said, "I'm an old man. I was once young. Now I'm old. I've seen it down through the age. hear people say, "I won't have no more to do with him." And something happened to that man and nearly kills him. He thinks, "Oh, God, I let my precious brother go without making friends with him." See, it's brotherly love. It looks like it won't stick, but it does stick. The honey, &gt;&gt; it sticks. &gt;&gt; See, it don't look like it will stick. I sure don't like Brother Neville. I sure don't like Brother said we ought to do that. Well, always we're going to have our preferences. &gt;&gt; I know you hear me say, you've heard me say this over and over as the Lord would bring this. We have our preferences. We have certain things. But this is where we can either choose to focus on what unites us together or focus on what divides us. I want you to listen to this. Brother Bram talks about this in, you know, everpresent water from the rock. Who says if you're really in love, you just can't wait till Sunday morning comes. You got to get down there with them. We get to leave. And the people of God, they don't bore you. They're brothers and sisters. As I used to say, you get as thick as sorghum molasses on a cold morning. It don't run. It just stays together, you know, clings tight. That's a rude expression, but it's trying to let you know what I mean. You stick together. And the colder it gets, the tighter they stick. And that's the way it ought to be with us. &gt;&gt; Rather says, "What we love each other is not because that we're somebody, but it's the Christ in one another that we love." You see, it's the God that's in our beings that we love. &gt;&gt; Oh, how we love to come together. I want you to think about this of just sticking together. Brother Bram will take this and I'm I'm closing. Brother Bam will take this on and he says, you know, he takes and talks about Moses and Zapora, a marriage. And he says here, Zapora had a little temper. Moses, he said, he had one, too. I mean, think about Moses. Moses writes of himself. Of course, it wasn't Moses thoughts. It was God's. Moses was the humblest man. It wouldn't be like you or I, you know, posting on Instagram, you know, your name and I'm the humblest person. Uh, it wasn't Moses thoughts about it. It was it was God. You know what the you know what the Bible humblest or meekst? You know what meekness means? Give place to. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's good. &gt;&gt; He gave place Brother Bram said, "How do you know?" He said, "That that little wife," he said, "that God gave you and that maybe that little temper or this or that." He said, "How do you know?" He said, "That ain't your cross to bear." And vice versa. He said, "But stick together." Now, you know how you stick together? He was talking about, you know, because this is this is a sticky part of us. That's not what he was talking about. Sticking like getting on one another's nerves, &gt;&gt; but he's talking about sticking together. What is it that would cause it to stick together? Well, if the if it's all about conditions, conditions change &gt;&gt; with time, &gt;&gt; right? Conditions change with time. &gt;&gt; I listen friends, I I' I've been I've been here long enough this past year. What was it this past year? 23 years that I've been pastoring here. I've been here long enough to where where where where people can come. This was the utopia. This is the this. Just give it time. &gt;&gt; Give it time. It's not that we're bad people here. You understand what I'm saying? Just give it time. Once you get around things, oh, if the conditions are right, everything's just right. But remember, conditions are going to change. You know why? Because eventually, you're going to get to see humanity. &gt;&gt; And the real reality is, you've got to think back. Listen to me now. You've got to think back. Did you make your choice based on humanity &gt;&gt; or was it a revelation? That's how it is in marriage. Because if it's not a revelation, you let the conditions just fade. You let it just fade right out and finally we're just looking for anything to split and go our own ways. &gt;&gt; But if there's a real revelation in our heart, &gt;&gt; amen, &gt;&gt; then you know what? That's something that allows us to stick &gt;&gt; through thick and thin. &gt;&gt; Don't worry, I ain't put no bars on the doors. I ain't trying to keep people here. I'm trying to I'm trying to stay within the focus of Do you understand what I'm saying? that if we're not, we cannot be right with God and be wrong with one another. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It can't be. We can't. Well, I'm growing so much. We can't we can't grow as we ought to grow in the stature of God if there's things that we're allowing to be between us. &gt;&gt; And you know, let me just tell you what that is. It's just the enemy. &gt;&gt; And when I say just the enemy, you got a calling for what it is. &gt;&gt; That's my brother and that's my sister. Let me tell you something. Let me just tell you something. When the enemy tries to come my way and give me a give me a thought and you know you're able to tell, wait a minute, you're not going to run down my brother. You're not going to run to my sister. Say, "Brother Sam, what do you do?" I call their name out in prayer. &gt;&gt; That's exactly what I do. I'd call their name out in prayer. &gt;&gt; My brother, I'll call my name, call their name out in prayer. You know why? If they, you know what? Thank you, devil. Because I almost forgot about brother so and so or sister so and so. Man, you're a big help today. Thank you. And you begin to pray in that way. But if you don't do that and you let it linger, oh, how it can build in your spirit &gt;&gt; and instead of giving that glass of water so gentle to the person at the table here and they're like, "What did I do? What did I do? &gt;&gt; Take these pills." You what? What did I do? It wasn't even anything about what they were doing. But what it is is that a thought had come in &gt;&gt; and we entertained it. And that's why Paul said, "Let not sin therefore reign exercise kingly reside in your body lest you obey it. &gt;&gt; Cast it out. &gt;&gt; Cast it out. &gt;&gt; You love him. &gt;&gt; Let's stand." Say, Lord, bind us together. &gt;&gt; Bind us together. You know, we don't want to be, every church truly has a doctrine, but we don't want to be known by doctrine. our lives and what God has called us to believe. But what we want to be known by I think the greatest the greatest thing that we can have. Brother Brandham would you know even say it among the believers the church there in 63 in church order. He said now the church he said I appreciate the quality of the spirit that's here. He said, ' Now when I say quality of the spirit, he said it isn't that we've got more shoutings than everybody else. He said, ' Matter of fact, we got less. He said it ain't that we've got more gifts. He says, matter of fact, we got less. He said, but what it is, it's the quality of the spirit &gt;&gt; that's among us. But Ram wasn't putting anything out on shouting. He wasn't putting anything out on all those other things. But it's the quality of the spirit. You know, the enemy, Satan's desire is to attack those things around us. Remember, as I said, it's not us. Oh, I know this one is and this one's not. This one's elect, this one's not. You don't know that. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, Brother Brandham was asked a question. Brother Brandham, I want to be able to come up on a person and know whether they've got the Holy Ghost. Brother Brandham says, "Stop." &gt;&gt; He said, "You're not going to know that. See, it's not about it. Let me just say it like this. Let me say it like this. Let me say this. What if you did know this person is not elect? What if God would allow you to even know that it shouldn't change our action &gt;&gt; towards them in one degree? Jesus knew about Judas &gt;&gt; the whole time. &gt;&gt; Now, I don't believe there's any Judas here. I preach and I stand upon this word. I believe each and every one to be going in the rapture. &gt;&gt; That's how I let that that's just how I preach it. That's how I look at it. Because let me tell you something, fruit can change in a split-second time. &gt;&gt; Lives can change in just a moment's time. And sometimes lives can get in a place lives where you can say, "I wonder what's wrong with this person." Maybe they've come through a hard maybe they come through a a hard moment in their life. &gt;&gt; Maybe the fruit isn't just all of a sudden just turning out like it needed to be. It don't mean that they're not a real believer. They might just be going through a hard time, &gt;&gt; a difficult time in their life. Maybe there's a time where there's a lot of sewing that's going on. They're watering it. All those things change. Seasons change so quickly. But may God help us in this hour. &gt;&gt; Lord, may the love of God be the theme of our lives. &gt;&gt; May it be the theme of our lives. &gt;&gt; Brother Samuel, you you could be wrong giving somebody the benefit of the doubt. I'd rather be wrong. &gt;&gt; I'd rather he right there. &gt;&gt; I'd rather heir because you know why? There's others that word, it's going to take an effect. That's &gt;&gt; right. God's word will have its victory in our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, how we we just Lord, looking to you tonight, Lord, and my just Lord, as some of these places and parts, Lord, that you've taken us into just to remind us, stir up our pure mind by way of remembrance. Call us, Lord, and draw us, Lord, into a to more more of yourself, Lord. More of you. Help us, Lord, I pray, dear God, as Lord, even as we look across your word and we find our hearts challenged, every one of us, Lord, you've seen, Lord, our hands that was lifted and raised to say, "Help me, Lord." Father, we we have to battle, but that's overcoming. That's overcoming. But Lord Jesus, help each and every one of us that's here. May Lord, every one of our hearts be so full of the love of God. And Lord Jesus, help us that Lord, we will sink deeper into the love of God. That bond of perfectness, &gt;&gt; that's what unites us together. It's not our personalities. Though, Lord, a lot of times we can gravitate toward certain personalities that we might be drawn to, and that's okay. But Lord, when it stops being okay is when that's where we stop. But Lord, as you've drawn us together as a body, we're different and you've done that by design. Every one of us, Lord, that's standing here, we have a part &gt;&gt; in the economy of God. Help us, Lord. I pray, oh God. May we may we look to you no matter, Lord, what we would feel about it. May we look to you, Father. Cuz it's not been any man that puts us into this place. If it's not any man that put us into the body, it's you. And Lord God, help us. Help us to stand in our position. Oh God, I pray Father tonight, may the love of God, the great honey, Lord God, that would cause it to stick together, cause a a bride body that's been being built down through the ages to come together in rapturing grace. Lord God, in an age where hatred would come to such a place, yet the love of God, the person of Jesus Christ to be made manifest in your fullness in a bride body. Lord Jesus, we believe everything that you have for us. But Lord, within all of that, as you would heal us, miracles among us, Lord. Oh God, I pray father grant Lord that every one of our hearts Lord just to be Lord overtaken by the love of God. Lord to become more like you, more and less of ourselves, Lord, less of Samuel and more of God. Help us, Lord. Lord Jesus, if you wanted it, you could have put together a group of people where we would somehow have every single thing in common. But you didn't do it that way. I think about it, Lord, how that you put the body together. You put some, Lord, maybe they would they have vision. they can see things and what's to be done. Then you have others, Lord, that maybe might be a little bit more passive and you use each one of those parts. What if we all were exactly the same? What if we all were passive? Nothing would get accomplished. But what if Lord that every one of us were that a vision and having this this this way my once again we wouldn't get anything accomplished but Lord you have placed the body together by design you've gathered a group of people and Lord we need each other &gt;&gt; we need the Christ in one another. Help us, Lord. Help every Lord, from every young person to middleage, older. Help us to be &gt;&gt; what you would have us to be. You don't want us to be like nobody else. You want us to be yielded that you can be yourself through us. Lord, help us. Lord, forgive us, Lord, of our shortcomings. I pray forgive us Lord as the prophet would go through that in brotherly kindness Lord in the times where we may have pulled back and we shouldn't have forgive us Lord help us Lord to override our feelings help us Lord to not allow things to build but oh God help us Lord feelings are real that's true but God may we not make a monument or an idol out of feelings. But oh God, give us grace. Help us, Lord. Sometimes, Lord, things just do not disappear overnight. It isn't because we just say, "Well, I'm not going to feel this way, Lord. It's quite the contrary. It's where you lead us and we find ourselves in need. Lord God, I need more. &gt;&gt; I need more. Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, I don't want that feeling. I don't want that to come around.
