Hallelujah let's just Spar heads in a word of prayer this morning you have a need upon your heart I know we've taken requests before the Lord but perhaps you have a need on your heart even would raise that same need up before the Lord maybe another need knowing that God he is mindful he cares he really he cares let's just approach it's thrown here this morning Lord Jesus there is none other no other God but the Lord father Lord Jesus we hear this morning Lord gathered Lord by you into your presence Lord and Lord you know every every need you know father and Lord we just would ask Lord this morning that you would help us Lord that father to even be able to catch you speaking to our hearts and to discern it Lord in the measure Lord that you would have us Lord to to understand it Lord we need you Lord we need that the grace of God lord to move Upon Our Lives this morning that Lord for it would surely go over us Lord if it's not Lord for you coming Lord and breaking your word to our hearts Lord and and doing Lord of work in our lives so we know that the word of God lord when it is preached oh God by the Holy Spirit Lord that there is an effect Lord because in your word is a transforming power Lord oh God that has that word It Goes Forth Lord it moves into our lives and Lord though we would not feel anything at all but Lord we know that the kingdom of God cometh without observation Lord and that kingdom of God lord is then Lord God not just in Lord neat and drink but it's in word and power Lord so father we ask the Lord God that you would just Lord have preeminence here Lord we we commit Lord every every single need we place them before your throne Lord and we believe and are looking Lord God that you would come Lord upon that request and that need Lord that our faith would rise into such a place Lord to where when there would be anything that would rise or speak against it Lord we would be Lord as that children of Abraham Lord that would Lord not entertain anything that would speak contrary Lord but such a Faith Lord that would reside within our hearts Lord and so we're asking Lord that may you the power of God Lord come Among Us Lord through the word Lord and speak to our hearts oh God may we be strengthened Lord and equipped Lord May father your word have free course here this morning Lord the Holy Spirit coming behind the Lord and backing up the word oh God lord as you give it Lord father you know every need Lord and as you have met each and every one of your children Lord you didn't meet Gideon in a burning bush but you met him Lord and where Gideon was prone and come to a place to ask Lord he asked that you would wait Lord while he went and draw and brought a sacrifice Lord you met him and you did for Gideon just what you did for Moses just what you did for Abram Lord you made yourself known to them in that personal way Lord and it forever changed the course of their life Lord father we asked this morning Lord that you will change Lord courses of life oh God here this morning we ask the Lord that we would be further change Lord in your presence Lord May there be a greater blending together Lord God of positive and negative Lord oh God where the flesh is becoming word and the word is becoming flesh Lord oh Father we just asked the Lord that you have your way Lord now Lord May oh God is the blood Lord that blood is speaking Lord for us Lord we're just praying oh God for every need Lord that now the Lord is brought before your throne Lord we place it there Lord because father you are above all things Lord Jesus you're above every situation Lord and Lord we're just asking Lord God right now may that great peace and consolation Lord that presenting it to you Lord You Lord who is the answer Lord and the dissolver Lord and the settler of all disputes Lord we place it in your hands Lord we commit it there Lord we ask it now Lord that you'll have your way father anoint Lord the speaker and here together may we be as one unit Lord we pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen let's go to Exodus chapter 17. verse verse 8. Exodus 17 verse 8. I I'm gonna go ahead and forewarn you I did not send them my notes today because there's just so much and uh that doesn't mean I'm Gonna Keep you here it's just there's so many points of when things and I just want to I just just want to do it go about it in that manner but there's so much here that within this in every part of the word when God gets a hold of the word there's so much within the word and you know the objective that we have is not that we try to squeeze every every last drop out of every scripture out of every word but we want for the season and for the moment what God has for us amen because if God tarries God will bring us back into these places and we'll visit them again is that right when when God made himself known to to Isaac Isaac did not go around and start digging new wells is that right when God revealed himself to Isaac see this is the difference when God revealed himself to Isaac as he did to Abram I am the Lord God of thy fathers notice he did not go start another well he kept digging he went back and he dug the same Wells that his father Abraham daughter and he didn't try to call him a different name he called him the name that his father called him why because the what that same God had been revealed to him and so he knew and this is where we stand here we want to dig in the same Wells that our father has dug in understand we want to dig in the same Wells when God has sent a message in this hour we don't have to create new wells we dig in the same Wells amen because in there is water Hallelujah that's a separate thought but this is powerful amen verse 8. then came amalek and fought with Israel in referred him and Moses said unto Joshua choose out men I like that you told Joshua choose out men Glory it's the holy spirit that selects that selects and brings forth his children these what these men are to do go out and fight with amalek tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand so Joshua did as Moses had said to him and fought with amalek and Moses Aaron and her went up to the top of the hill and it came to pass when Moses held up his hand that Israel prevailed and when he let down his hand amalek prevailed but Moses hands were heavy and they took a stone and put it under him and he sat thereon and Aaron and her stayed up his hands the one on the one side and the other on the other side and his hands were steady until the going down of the Sun and Joshua discomforted amalek and his people with the edge of The Sword and the Lord said unto Moses write this for a memorial in a book and rehearse it in the years of Joshua but I will utterly put out the remembrance of amalek from under heaven and Moses built an altar and called the name of it Jehovah Nissi for he said because the Lord has sworn that the Lord will have war with amalek from generation to generation amen we want to continue to look at the thought this morning keeping deity in our midst may God bless you as you're being seated bless his word I want to touch on a few places here from from last week and um as we look here the that which Moses was holding there in the air the scriptures in verse 9 say it refers to it as the rod of God and we've seen of how that in Exodus 4 it was a rod that Moses had in his hand from the shepherding of the sheep and tending to flocks when they were there in the wilderness and there's no doubt about it Moses had no idea that God was going to take a simple stick and use a simple stick he had no idea but but God works he hides but he also reveals himself in simplicity you think about it how many times did uh shamgar walk over the ox goat he didn't know where the ox code was at but in the midst of that moment the ox gold became more than just an ox goat it became a tool in the hand of a son of Abraham who was yielded to God who made the Covenant and the promise of God coming through that yielded vessel took an instrument and drove back thousands and brother bam takes that short little scripture in shamgar is because samgar got to thinking he says shamgar got to thinking about his family he got to thinking of I've planted these crops and about the time the crops are being ready to be harvested here they come and yet here God comes along and get and shamgar begins to remember that he is a son of Abraham very very much the same way with Samson in Samson's life you know he here he is in the midst how many times maybe he's walked over you know I don't want to say he's necessarily walked over that Jawbone of an ass over and over but to say that maybe when he had maybe looked at it before if he had looked at it or saw it or whatever it was things that would be common then and something you would say see laying around but in that moment there was a need that arose and it was God that directed him because Samson nobody would have thought about picking up the Jawbone of an ass and going out there to defeat the enemy it would have been too brittle who how could this have how could this have withstood the enemy at that time but it wasn't the Jawbone of an ass so much as it was a Son of God a son of Abraham that was yielded to the Lord in that moment it we see Samson himself you know it's painted so clear to us uh through the the eyes of this hour through the messenger that he's Samson was not some great big muscular man that was all stretched out there God God didn't need Earthly muscle God still don't need Earthly muscle you don't not meaning our Earthly strength it fails it's look look here in the example what what an example that is a type here you see how that Moses his hand is up with the rod of God but notice as as time goes on his hands begin to go down it gets heavy and he needs others to to keep it up and it shows that man in himself in just his his human strength is not able to hold it up it takes one greater he who is the strength Giver himself see God allows this Victory to be displayed but then yet in the midst of this God also lets it be displayed that there has got to come a greater raising up of this Rod of God there's got to come a greater raising of it up and it's got to be one that not only could raise it up but one that could hold it up that that would be maintained what is it the Simplicity just like the Jawbone just like the Arts gold just like that of this rod and God makes known to hear to to to Moses he asked Moses what is that in thine hand and here what in the midst of that time when the rod is cast down upon the ground it's in it's in his hand but now he must take it in his hands so Moses hereby the word The Authority now that that Rod is cast down it becomes a serpent and as it goes up on the ground then God speaks to Moses again and says reach down with thine hand and take it up what is hand it's panned is power and authority so he's instructing him do this take it up with thine hand so when we we look at this of when we're seeing it of how that this rod in itself it was a rod that would go about and Moses no doubt it used to direct sheep for many time but yet it was going to become a rod of judgment in the hand of Moses and notice let me read how the prophet says it once again in this great servant Moses he said as Moses went with the Judgment stick before him that same stick tonight to the church is Jesus Christ so now he's he's bringing that type now showing that the same stick is Jesus Christ if those Egyptians could have ever got that little simple stick out of Moses hands they'd have had him whipped but they did not recognize that that was a that was a rod of judgment and it was something that to them it was simple see listen now what what would it what would have even caused it to wear if I can just speak just for a few moments freely remember what would it have been where they would have not said well let us have your stick instead it because they had they had those of magicians jammies and jambres that they could throw down their sticks and they became serpents it wasn't that Egypt listen to me now it wasn't that Egypt didn't have signs and wonders are you with me they had signs and wonders but what it is is that within Egypt those signs and wonders were not being given in a manner to bring Liberty those signs and wonders among the people only kept them in bondage because one wanted to do they looked simply at the signs and the Wonders and it kept them worshiping other deities other gods and if I can say it very clearly in this manner it keeps people with signs and wonders and other things and we believe let me just say this real clear We Believe signs and wonders follow the believer that's part of the Church of the Living God is that right that's part of the Bride of Jesus Christ because what he did in the groom he does in the bride he's the same yesterday and Forever The Works that I do shall you do also but those works are not just limited nor confined to just signs and wonders and miracles because remember that even through the manifestation of Miracles then there are those who can take back and instead of when the doctrine begins to go off they'll point the people in a manner and say at least we get results are you with me now you know I'm coming from what is it it's a power that's holding the people but yet when you see it that within God there is a people that are a part of that word that are ordained to come in Union with that word and they in themselves there's something that's lacking they see healing they see Miracles they see things but yet they recognize there is something that's missing because there's got to be something where there is a power that can come and bring an overcoming life I don't want just healing in my body it's got to be healing of the Soul amen there's got to be a power that packs full Deliverance amen something that doesn't keep in bondage but it delivers see that kind of power being manifested binds people to the vessel are you with me but the power of God when it's coming through the word it binds and unites people to Jesus Christ in a love affair that's Liberty a simple stick out of Moses hands they'd have had him whipped they couldn't talk Moses out of that they couldn't get it away from me let me say this to you to the real believers to the Church of the Living God there's not enough explanation that can take the Holy Ghost there's not enough that can take the deity of Jesus Christ from the life of a Believer I don't care what kind of reasoning comes and well they believe Jesus just as much and they believe but they can't get that little spit out of your hands that which has been laying here in the word but now hear what we see that same Mighty God Rising can't get it out we don't need any more we don't need any more move of God we don't need they can't get that simple stick out I'll tell you brother and sister we still need the moving of the Lord let me say this the preaching of the word of God the Gospel of Jesus Christ brings the Holy Spirit on the scene amen we we don't need a rehearsal of History we need that same God present to our young people and people coming into this church to where they when they come face to face and they recognize something is different they recognize that God is present they recognize that God who gave the word who wrote the word who made the promise is alive and real and wants to fulfill that promise that's necessary because history never produces power but the God who knows history is the god who makes himself known as the I am present amen and the I am takes care of History when the devil look at this when the devil could ever get the deity I'm saying it like you can read it I'm so used to that when the devil could ever get the deity out of the name of Jesus Christ he's got the church whipped get the deity out of the name not just having the name of Jesus Christ but he wants to take the power the deity the literal life out of the name notice he he says as the Judgment stick went before Moses to take the judgment to bring the Judgment so does the name of Jesus go before us to take our judgment it stands our Judgment of sickness stands our Judgment of death stands our Judgment of trouble he has already stood for us I watch watch I want you to look at this here as we were reading in in Exodus 17. God after this discomforting of amalek here the Lord God told Moses I don't want this to be forgotten I don't want it to be forgotten but God what amalek did and God said what I want you to do I want you to write it down into a memorial I want you to write this down and then after it's wrote I want you to rehearse it into the ears of Joshua so I don't just want it to be something that he just reads come on somebody but I want I would be rehearsed in his ears in other words what is written must be spoken and Joshua has one that's going to have ears to hear and not just going to be able to have the ears to hear that he can finish what has been wrote no no that's not what we're talking about we're not talking about stars on a chart in Sunday school we're talking about where then that when that is rehearsed in the ears of Joshua as something that rises within Joshua in every time that it remains to remembrance what amalek has done to do what deal with amalek glory be to God notice this in verse 14. know that God said rehearse it in the ears of Joshua so it's got to be told in the ears of Joshua but we got to look at a key part here for I will utterly put out the remembrance of amalek from under heaven you will God's letting him what is God doing he is committing himself to his word he's committing himself that he alone is the one that will deal with amulet and is he alone that'll put amalek out of remembrance God wants him remembered but yet he wants to put it out of remembrance oh he won't say he wants it to be remembered but then he said I'm going to put it out of remembrance y'all with me now right Hallelujah because in verse 16 because the Lord has sworn that the Lord will have war with amalek from generation to generation now God he he puts this he puts this down in Deuteronomy 25 even in 200 Deuteronomy 25 17 and God would hear they're getting ready to come into the land here is is preliminary counsel that's being given and and there to be remembered of this right here and you know sometimes you look there's things that you and I don't want to remember is that right but there are things that we do need to remember come on somebody and God here he could have wrote this at the beginning of Deuteronomy 1 but instead now it comes toward the latter part of Deuteronomy and right in here he he asked in verse 17 remember what amalek did unto thee by the way when you were come forth out of Egypt Verse 18 how he met thee by the way look what he did and smoke behind most of thee even all that were feeble behind thee when thou was faint and weary and he feared not God let me say it like this here here is Israel they the the the rod of God has just been used to smote The Rock in the wilderness that they would have drink and here is amalek amalek is not going to attack the front he ain't gonna attack the Middle where amalek is coming amalek as a scripture identifies and God wants to remember that he attacked the weak he said I want it remembered all those that were feeble behind thee when thou was faint and weary oh Jesus then I preach now you might feel this morning I don't feel very strong but God is mindful of you you might feel weak but God is mindful of you he was not having them remember amulet because amalek attacked the strong he was saying remember amulet because amulet did not even fear me and he came against those that were weak those that were feeble you know what God was saying if you want to pick a battle with me and my people come to me [Applause] amen don't mean don't go around and check my children and come at them and attacking weakness but if you've got something come to me glory be to God oh Stay With Me Now Stay With Me Now glory be to God God help me to Pace myself when the Lord noticed God said after the Lord has given the Lord God had given you rest from your enemies in the land when you have received rest from your enemies in the land but I want you to rise up and I want you to remember amalek you get over in the land don't you get comfortable and forget about him cause I ain't forgetting about him [Music] let me tell you something when God has given a word and God releases his word his promise for that generation that word is not just something that's to be spoken in that generation and we somehow Rejoice around that and forget about it there is a purpose when God sends his word and when God visits a generation there is a purpose that is had within it amen there's a reason within it that word when it comes what is it it is the very word that has already been written and laid out by the prophet if we can say it in that manner and the same one who is the prophet and the prophesy what does he do he rehearses it in the ears of Joshua he rehearses it in the ears of his body what don't just become complacent that this message that God has sent us is not just another move remember Emily remember amulet remember Emily remember ambulance because I have remembered you you are my son of Promise born in this son than daughter that's after the flesh but you are mine and high I'm not going to forget my promise sin has got to be dealt with it can't be forgotten nor swept under the rug you see the scriptures are clear and I don't want to dwell on this point a lot this morning but the scriptures are clear that God visits the iniquity from generation to generation it increases it multiplies is that right we we see that that where when and even in the household of David I don't want to elaborate so much upon that this morning but you see how God will he addresses and he deals with that so sin itself has got to be dealt with you can't just you can't Overlook it you can't make excuses for it it can't be forgotten it's got to be dealt with it is that right and there's only one that can deal with it and that's him but he only can deal with it through willing vessels now think of this here came one amalek even to where that in numbers 24 when Balaam is moved by the spirit of God and Balaam here God begins to speak there through Balaam and he begins to speak about how that there is a star going to rise out of Jacob he begins to speak of this this which is coming this coming one you see God even made Balaam testify of it he borrowed balaam's lips I hope you're with me God can borrow and listen friends I'm not throwing everybody out as bailing but what I'm telling you is God can take things can take words and can take those things that are inspiration that has dropped even in songs and other things but yet there is such a significance and a depth of meaning among the children of almighty God the elect of God it has such a meaning My God is Awesome but I don't sing my God is awesome because when I come to church will I get all cleaned up again and when I go back out I live filthy and then I come back into church and I get all cleaned up again I'm not saying that that's the way that the guy who wrote it that went about that but I'm telling you my God is awesome because there is a power that is able to save to the uttermost it's able to bring a cleansing down on the inside and you're aware that Christ himself becomes merged and Blended in and United in the life of the believer and it is God then working himself and his will through your life that's awesome um so here the prophet as he takes us in the seventh seal he says it's an old battle that started way back Beyond Time and and and Satan and his angels was kicked out and then they come to earth and the battle set in again what is this remembering what amalek has done Hallelujah because he broke down from where she was isolated behind the word of God and from that very hour Satan won the battle over God's word because one of his subjects the weaker let down the bar what is this amaleks attack the weak and the feeble you're with me now so here remember Satan never came to Adam first time first Timothy 2 Adam was not deceived because why Adam was the word you can't deceive the word glory be to God is that right so he came to the church who came to the woman that which had been taken out of him but yet her womb had not been sealed yet and he begins to come to the weaker that's what the scripture says in the book of Peter it lets us know give honor unto her as unto the weaker vessel is that right so here God is pointing this out he even points that God's care look Ephesians 5 husband and wife God is pointing out the care that the husband the strong one you ought to be the strong one let me just stop for a moment you ought to be the strong one I'm not talking about everything's my way and we do it this we bless God God's given me to be the head of the house and God's called you to be a bully too a dictator come on somebody her brother Sammy you are preaching so well no I'm dealing with amulet I'm dealing with family yes sir because you see Christ himself who is the strong one the mighty one notice how Paul would direct how the strong one is to care for the weaker one you and I did not have what was needed to be able to overcome but the strong one prevailed and he prevailed and overcome he gave to us the spoil of the victory Glory notice Eve broke down that barrier and that's exactly how he won the battle every time by what reasoning reasoning reasoning he gets in the reason gets to imagination well you know God's a good God and God understands and God this and got that it's amazing you know that when I go to the bookstore I don't see your name on a new Bible version maybe you've got your own you know app and you've got your own table version now come on Friends people have their certain quotes and they have their certain things that they like let me tell you we ought to be able to take off the word of God let me tell you this is exactly how the spirit of God spoke in this hour in the Easter seal had the spirit of God standing there in the prophet he said he that cannot take the full word of God is a sinner they called Jesus and said you'll be else about and Jesus said if you cannot believe me believe the works they testify me and the prophet comes around again at the end of the message and he says he that cannot believe and to take and accept that fluid of God is a sinner let me tell you something receiving the full word of God does not end with the prophet the full word of God must be born into existence in the lives of his people are you with me oh you're saying we recognize that just recognizing God sent a prophet doesn't deal with Emily you're with me you can find things that that that can be shown out to cover up amalek not the spirit of God doing that come on somebody we're talking about a depth that's here A Life That's to be produced not just the half the blood but you must apply the blood and when you apply the blood then the life will come how do I apply the block believe what the word which is the blood of Jesus Christ is issuing for it believe that word and surrender to it and the spirit of God will come right behind it because one of his subjects let down the bar from the word but much we could speak even within that you know friends were all we were faced we're faced each and every day in every part in our life the whole thing of in the enemy's advancement in approach he doesn't he won't come to you necessarily when you're in your strong times you understand I'm not talking about your soul now I'm talking about times when you feel strong man but he'll come in those times to try to make advancement on you I'm not talking about dragging you out in sin oh brother the same I I couldn't help but he drugged me back out to the BART no you weren't sealed in no no you weren't sealed in that's just the truth because to make it any other way we've got a powerless gospel we've got a powerless atonement we got a power this Holy Ghost you're going to say man or not because this word did not come with that power amen he said you're to be you're to receive that Holy Ghost and be Witnesses of me unto the uttermost parts the prophet himself he said he talked about here he is he's standing in the message of perfect Faith he also brings it up in uniting time and sign he stands in perfect Faith he says you think I don't get gloomy spells too you think I don't get moody I'm talking about the prophet of God I'm talking about the flesh he that was born after Charles and Ella Branham I'm not talking about the Son of God brother Branham are you with me just like you getting Moody watch and he says that's when Satan comes at me when I get myself all overworked and I get weak it comes at him with thoughts nobody cares about you and what did the prophet say he looks back and he looks over the congregation here's people that stayed around for a second service well I'm not preaching a whole enough Joshua's holding up Moses hands today we still got some time on that thing God just put some things on back but here he is he looks around and he sees people that drove at such a distance and here they are standing people who are standing faithful what does it do it encourages him and he said I'll turn right back around and tell Satan look at that look at that you need to just pick up your phone once a while and say look at that text Buddy let me read it to you I saved it in a file so Samuel you're crazy maybe I am but I have files that I have saved words of encouragement cards that have been given over the year and you know what I'll get them out and read over many many times oh brother Samuel that that's carnal is it when the prophet said he would get down he said he would go into his den room and he would look around at each one of those trophies and he would remember the hunt well the prophet could not only remember that in remembering the hunt but when I could begin to look back on that it's a reminder to me I believe that God is moving whether I see it or not but when I can read that in the testimony of the lives that is the objective that burns within my heart is that the gospel has first place and preeminence in the hearts of the people and is producing in them that same victory that's worth rejoicing here God remembers my Lord I don't know where time goes [Laughter] my God he lays it out [Music] when the when the situation has come God remember he goes down through in dressing he comes to the man the man passes to the woman and the woman said well the serpent beguiled me and and then God comes and he lets it be known in Genesis 3 15 that that I'm going to put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed see God God knew that there had to be and there is only one remedy to deal with amalek God even would have it rewrote by Moses and referred to a country of amaleks in Genesis 14 before amalek was ever born you with me he won the amalekites but it was called the country of amalekites why God already prophetically knew that expense that the amalekites that they would reside in but God also knew that I that is the country that belongeth to my seed and to my children and they shall be dispelled glory be to God now watch this there's no lasting Victory like here's Moses his hands up it will go down human strength what's that like it's like the law right holding up real good then it gets heavy why because there's not human strength can't do it you see friends human strength might keep it up Taryn and might keep it up there for years and all of a sudden it goes down it can't be human strength that that's not what serving God is all about serving God is where he becomes the indwelling within our life and then we are his servants by sonship or daughters in his economy by the new birth there's no lasting victory within this measure watch this how the prophet will remember how the brother Brown will tell us over and over he says when God told Joshua and them to come into the land he told them you destroy all the inhabitants is that right Donnie said don't you even leave a baby now come on now let's not get all hung up like the secular world destroying the babies God's letting something be shown here if you let a little malachite grow he'll grow to be a big amalekites come on somebody time don't change nothing don't change but there must be one step into time and when one steps into time one from eternity he's the one that can bring a change in time that lasts for eternity Hallelujah so get rid of those little amalekites we could name him but we'll wait in Exodus 17 which we read let me just show you this in Exodus 17 Moses they were discomforted that day by the edge of the sword they were not completely eradicated because God said remember it write about it and rehearse it in the years of Joshua when it came time to go over into the land the children of Israel rebelled against the word of the Lord the report was brought back the land is as God said it would be but but Joshua but Moses you you said that God met you there at the burning bush and and you said that that God said that he would bring us into a land that flows with milk and honey and you would that we would drive up yes that's what God Said but their focus they started focusing on things as though God evidently missed this God didn't see this no what what it is is that as you move in the promise his strength moves through you he gives you strength listen now let's just make it very simple when God deals with your heart through the preaching of the word he brings conviction to a heart and a person is drawn to repent of their sins and receive Jesus Christ as their savior is that right that's the strength of God coming to meet you in your weakness you rise in that strength and repent is that right then that strength it preached put you in a place to where that now the word can begin to move in your life and the blood coming and being applied it brings a sanctification right what is that Grace providing strength for you to come to what God is calling you to then that same strength it moves you along into a further work of God's grace and strength to wear now that he births within you his own life and you become merged with him in a union and then as you're in that union he gives you strength day by day by day what is it it's him in you increasing in you what Israel failed to do under Joshua in taking the entire land the Holy Ghost In You Christ in you is taking the whole land the land was a choice spot is that right the land was a designated spot that the Messiah would come and reveal himself in that land that's why Israel had to come out of of Egypt and come into the land because in the land then the promise of the Messiah would come to pass so the whole journey was about the Messiah coming to pass and the Messiah would be God himself stepping down into a body form it was a designated land and through that designated land notice here there was a need because when God himself coming here Among Us God is not going to forget about his Covenant and so God remembering his Covenant watch God remembering this Covenant that he pulled write it down God remembers it by himself coming according to his word he comes job said man born of a woman is a few days old full of trouble right so here God remembering what that he is the one who will utterly put out of remembrance amulet that he alone will do this he is remembering his Covenant for he comes through and by and the Flesh and Blood coming he recreates a blood cell that he might come a body that he might come and dwell in what's he doing remembering when God became one of us he's remembering his Covenant is a memorial that's being rehearsed amen the Bible says rehearse this in the ears of Joshua is that right here when when Simeon the Bible says that Simeon a man full of the Holy Ghost that's the first thing full of the Holy Ghost it was revealed to him why the holy ghost that he should see he should not see death until he seen the Lord's Christ what was he doing he wants to see the culmination of the promise of the Messiah that was coming that that word was to come again and be materialized and come completely in human flesh what is it son of man are you with me Christ's coming down and stepping right in the midst it's God revealing himself is it no Marvel this is not coincidence in this hour how many times the prophet in the earlier part of the ministry and continued to pick it up how Simeon was led by the spirit of God he's not just talking about somebody being led by the spirit he's speaking of the hour where Christ himself is becoming personally identified not just through the prophet's life but in a many-membered body hey man that's a rapture that brings a rapture right so in looking at this God when he come remember the Scriptures it lays Out For unto us a child is born is that right unto us a child is born and and and and the uh unto us the son is given the government shall be upon his shoulder his strength see the strength and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end there was a need for a redeemer see look at this how did all of this works with Israel Israel refuses to go into the land the amalekites come down and discomfort Israel what was it Israel letting down the bar Israel was letting down the bar how are they letting down the bar by doubting God they doubted that God was able to perform what he said and because of that it caused him to let down the bar is that right here's the word when God has given a word you'll be tested on that word you're tested on that word when God is given his word to your life into your heart you're going to be tested on that he's going to come at you every time there's an event listen friends with what God desires to do in your life don't think the devil ain't going to bring up every failure and everything else don't think he's not going to try to do that but you have got to remember there is a covenant in place there is a blood that packs within it Saint to find power there is a life that is present that brings total and complete deliverance there is blood on The Mercy Seat [Music] you've got to remember those things that pertain to you amalekites came down here they are these guys are still hanging around in the Book of Judges in Gideon's time malachites these guys keep showing up like springtime ends first Samuel 15. Here Comes Here Comes the word of the Lord by Samuel to Saul so I'll go down there and kill again uh he just said kill all of them this was God's word but you see Saul shows the weakness of man the weakness of man Saul spares him he spares also choice sheep and other things too he's got an excuse for it you with me Saul's got an excuse we'll let that marinate over a few weeks here you find David in first Samuel 27 when David is down there when he had run from Saul and he's there in the land of Philistines when they gave him the country of ziglak here he goes and he uh invades all of these uh the gurusites the garasytes and the malachites you find then in first Samuel 30. here the amalekites come down and take David's wife when they're away in battle is that right so what I'm just trying to show without elaborating on all those things is you see that there was no lasting victory they're not able to get rid of these things they keep coming back I hope somebody hear me this morning there's only one thing that can get rid of the amalekites and that's the Lord himself I will utterly put out of remembrance there's only one thing that can release within the individual prevailing power and that is Christ himself in you glory be to God everybody all right we're just getting started [Applause] just read I'm So Glad You Came Back [Laughter] God bless you we really are I'm not just teasing we really are we love you sister that's how God the virgin how that God makes us known that God he's got he creates himself he's going to give himself a son back so he can't take something that's already of this creation of this race but God creates himself a blood cell he creates himself a body that he himself alone apart from the woman apart from a sex act that he himself has created and that's a virgin birth because why because then by that he can come and he can claim that part of the Earth you see he wasn't trying to claim all the Earth right then he was just trying to get that part of the earth he had created that Palestine part because if he can get that Palestine but he redeems and brings to himself that son that he has created through that son he can redeem the rest of the Earth [Applause] [Music] what's he doing he's dealing with amalek oh my as he's baptizing here comes down out of the heaven the heavens are open here and see the Holy Ghost descending in the form of a doubt it latched down upon that Temple it comes to claim what it alone has created and brought forth this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased to dwell in what is it it's God who was overshadowing and bringing forth the body it was in the womb there it was a word that was their prophecy that was there throughout that time and now notice how the word was moving and the word had come into a place of where now it was in the womb but that word itself it had to be born out of that womb of a church and that word had to stand here and the spirit of God standing right there in the midst of that word in its fullness you with me that is why the Rapture itself could not come to the lady of seeing age per se The Headstone could not set down on that lady of sin age brotherly kindness but it must be the coming of The Headstone that draws up those who are identified in his life all the way down through and it brings you and I into a place of the Holy Spirit right there where it is Christ himself now remember he releasing his life not just a baptism of the Holy Ghost but the person of Christ himself now dwelling in his fullness in a bright body where he is having the preeminence you know how the prophet says in Spoke original words words original C what's he doing in that message he is dealing with remembering remember remember and he began what the spirit of God doing the spirit of God is showing all the way down through time where the failure has taken place in the seals what do what has been as he himself is being revealed and it reveals what shall be who is it Christ he which once which is and which shall come what's he doing he's revealing that Cassie that sin can be swept under the rock or forgotten about Sin must be repented of it that's the end of the age it says I would that word hot or cold bezelius therefore and repent if it repentance is called then it shows a supreme sacrifice he has stepped forward as the amen of God in Revelations 3. I hope you're with me I don't have time to read I'm just going to quote you're going to pick it up now as it's coming and he stands as the amen of God in this age and he is calling the age to repentance every age has been called to repent us because there has been elect children down through every age and it is God himself that has made it known he's dealing with amulet and it's not something new that he's doing but he's pointing us back to the finished work of calvary Romans 8 3 that the law itself was weak in the flesh but God himself came in the likeness of sinful flesh and condemned sin in the flesh that we might receive the spirit of Life the spirit of righteousness the righteousness fulfilled of the law in our lives what righteousness or righteousness that is not something says I could do this but I better not do it I wouldn't do this but they said I can't do it that's not righteousness of God that's self-made righteousness but the righteousness of God which is there given by the spirit of righteousness and Holiness himself is the same Lord Jesus the righteous one himself living in the midst of his children whereby your cleansed you are Sanctified and filled with his spirit and you no longer want the things of the world the world is dead what is that that's dealing with Hamlet that's why the rod of God is not laid in a museum I don't want you to be a museum he don't want you to be a stone Idol he don't want you to be a wooden image the Bible said that they that speak unto them are lacking unto him why because the image can't hear you can't hear either but the image of Jesus Christ speaks and his children are able to hear his voice they hear the words of the wild underwear that has been given down Through the Ages God has made real in this hour through his Prophet that this is the time this is the culmination lay aside every sin and every weight that does so easily be set us and let us run this race of patience looking unto Jesus who's the author and the finish of our faith it's a doing calling to remembrance Prophet stepping forth in this age think of it he steps forth in this age he says what is this where people where's rugged Christianity where is it he said people become so entangled with entertainment they'd rather he said they'd rather stay home and I Love Lucy and I have other things that's a problem friends when people don't want to come to the house of God you got a love problem oh brother Samuel I know I know you can use that quote going to church don't save you but there's more quotes that go with it as well it ain't a building that saves you ain't in a building that bled for you but it's a preaching of the Gospel of Jesus Christ that not only saved your soul but it keeps you clean keeps you straightened up keeps you lined up you know why because it doesn't speak to lamalek it addresses the real son and daughter on the inside that that son and daughter of God raises up and says aha amalek trying to advance in weakness I got you you're trying to scramble upon feebleness what does he do he manifests himself as your strength glory be to God he remembers his Covenant when he became one of us he remembered his Covenant by becoming and and making a body and then through that body through the offering of that body up for you and I and then the sending back of the Holy Spirit it is God himself showing the whole Plan of Redemption is God showing I have remembered I have remembered and listen it was not something that God just learned but remember just as God could lay out and know what the country and called the country in Genesis 14 8 the country of the amalekites it's the same Lord God that knew had knowledge of that there would be a need of a lamb so God himself in his mind before the foundation of the world he laid for himself he becoming the atonement for his own children how could he become the atonement for you and I he can only become the atonement by he himself becoming one of us and the lamb was slain before the foundation the world God was already mindful think of it that in the work and in the midst of this hour here you find that notice after what was done in the book of Exodus 17 now let me just try to bring bring it down here you find that how that they lifted up that Banner the rod of God and there an altar is built they begin to worship worship around that Victory worship around that strength but then we've seen how that that Victory itself does not continue to last Every Generation and each time it's got to be Revisited it's the same thing now even though that there the answer has come for it every generation must receive that same true experience every young person no matter born of of holy ghost-filled parents are not must receive that same experience to know about the message to know that it's truth is not the experience but to have that word that life living in you to where he is everything to you I'll tell you right now that's the love of God dwelling in your heart but you see without that in your life you look at it as though it's human strength you can go and approach things for a long time you say well brother Samuel shouldn't I go ahead and continue in the word you should continue in the word if you realize that you're lacking within that you should but remember continuing in that word is looking for God to come and fulfill that word and say Lord you made this promise Lord and I am prostrating myself before you you who gave the word it doesn't matter how big their malachites are it doesn't matter how big the sons of Annika are it all that matters is you made the promise and I believe that I am a part of that promise I was ordained in this age for that promise to take a hold of my life and for that promise to reflect itself through me you believe that let me tell you something Prophet can't do it for you Pastor can't do it for you Church can't do it for you let me go and say it like this Jesus Christ himself standing here and flesh can't do it for you either You Must Believe you've got to believe it is for you you've got to believe that this promise is mine there'll be all kinds of opposition that's true but don't look at the opposition look at God who made the promise it isn't a position that's going to give you the promise it is God who made the promise he glorifies himself in you as you receive the promise and the promise becomes light in you it is God glorify himself in his word in you that he is greater than all opposition you love him the Virgin birth produced the necessary product right I love how the prophet says in the message breached he said here we were we were all out on a limb he said I've got you out on a limb right now we needed a redeemer he said but let me sound the trumpet to you the Virgin birth produced the product notice sound a trumpet what does a trumpet do it's letting you know you no longer have to remain a Slave it is a sound Ransom has come not just the shedding of his blood but this is the time and the Fulfillment of the word just as the time of Jubilee everything must coincide he himself who is the Jubilee his own life it has sounded out because he himself has given him his life as the very Ransom and that life speaks the blood the blood of Abel the law said you're guilty right the blood of Abel it it condemned Cain but the blood of Jesus you all right with this the blood of Jesus the prophet tells us in the message token I love how he says it he said but the blood of Jesus can take care of Cain notice how he's applying this and approaching it he said so you old Cain if you've been a doubter of the word why don't you come on over here and let the blood change you is that right because there's Abel inside a king Cain will always try to suffocate Abel but when Abel receives the power of God within him he's able he's able I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me Abel is able Evil by what Abel by the strength of God within it's God dealing with amulet from generation to generation here is God he don't forget this he don't forget see he's dealt with it been going down Through the Ages but now when it's time for the closing out of all things here he comes and Revelations 10 1. I see a mighty angel his hands were lifted up to the heavens but a very important point about his head was a rainbow Hallelujah what is it he's got his mind on his Covenant he has remembered his Covenant he has remembered his word amen what does he come forth to do he's come for us to bring about that change not just within the soul but that which leads to the very change of the body he came listen now he had to come and reveal himself in son form let me come back now I'm trying to come back to this and try to he come and revealed himself in some form claim that part of the Earth is that right now through claiming that part of the earth now he's Redeeming the rest of the earth through the shedding of the blood and now the Holy Spirit going out down through the dispensation of the Son of God the Holy Spirit has been going out and it's been collecting all of the subjects right but now comes now the transition from Son of God to Son of Man what now coming a son of man notice it's Christ himself has he stepped in and there he used a little body of a Kentuckian in the message unveiling of God in 1964 the prophet said oh I've been keeping this from you for all these years now veiling Christ but it didn't stop there in the message Harvest Time the prophet said all that seed that went in the ground that seed has got to come back up again and he said what is that seed coming back up again that is the mature Harvest of the life that's been planted it's that life that has brought the other seeds to maturity and now what is it there is a people upon the Earth under the ministry of the son of man it's the same life reproduced back in the people once again living that same life it's the son of man being revealed Christ in you the hope of glory because as one was raised from the Earth and he was waved that son of man here he was waved showing what there's more to come but now at the end at the end of time here at the blending of Eternity now comes forth a message with full power packs within it full Deliverance calls us back think of think of think of think of these titles spiritual amnesia think of the title it calls the people back to say why are you living the way you're living why are you living Beneath Your Privilege why are you living beneath this what does he say you don't know who you are so he didn't say you got to escape this world and then you'll be victorious no no what has he started with you started with that of that of that slave who was in bondage that slave was was in bondage but when the people came to look at that slave they saw that slave and they said you feed him different no do they sleep different no why is he stand out among all the rest oh because his daddy listen it's not just enough that his daddy is a king he's got to know his daddy is a king and when he knows his daddy is a king when that's revealed it affects his life you might still be in slavery but it's free right here he's a free man right here and he can look at that and say amalek you've already been dealt with your change is on its way same in you right he comes to redeem the he comes to redeem that small part but then from there the rest of it he takes he takes the rest of it is that right and leads it to a complete change it's him in you Christ the hope of glory it's him that has and is manifesting how that he has dealt with amalek that is why the coming of the Holy Ghost in This Hour is the coming of the abstract to the title deed these are not just words this is a reality the abstract is the answer to the sin question the abstract strikes off all leans you know what that means right there's nobody can rise up and say oh oh by the way there's an overdue tax bill too late the abstract has searched it all the way back oh there's an overdue water bill no there's not that sounds like the accuser of the brethren come on somebody but when you know that abstract you know down within all the prophets said and standing in the Gap he said oh my when that love of Christ has so struck your soul in the tenderness of Jesus Christ he said the world is dead to you you're not trying to see how much you can live in the world you're not trying to see how close you can get but the world it's it's dead to you he said as a matter of fact it it's something that to you you want to get so far away from not how close you can get seeing the tenderness of Jesus Christ then it's his strength in you his strength in me in his mind is on his Covenant and there's a people who have been admonished by the spirit of God go take the little book that is open in the hand of the angel who standed up there upon the land and the Sea go to him how would you know to go to him there's got to be eyes on Earth that he has come to you with me this is revelation 7. that sounds to Revelation 7 and the sounding points you to the mighty angel right Christ be with you till we meet again right Christ who is Christ is the deity of almighty God Christ revealed in his word by his power in his people revealed there is nothing that is too great for him nothing a people that is to go take that book listen friends you can't take that book with sin still send nature in your life you can't do I'm not putting nobody down I'm telling you the truth you can't take it by sin nature if there are things about your life that you know that are holding you back ask God say Lord cleanse Me Lord give me Lord God that power in the rod to where my life is not just a rod but where's the power inside of it amen I don't want to keep dealing with the same amalekites showed you that in the scripture keep coming back keep coming back keep coming back keep coming back keep coming back I believe with all my heart there's a maturing but I don't want to preach just a maturing because if you haven't been born again you can't never mature is that right unless you're born again you can't add virtue knowledge Temperance or whatever more it's putting peacock feathers in are you with me you got it it's got to be a birth and then when the birth it rises from there sure there's a maturing sure there is an increasing of his strength and his power and his authority in our life absolutely watch this in the scriptures my my let's just close time Joshua was down there fighting the battle keep this in mind here's Joshua down here fighting the battle Aaron and her are holding up his hands the prophet puts it like this in the message stand still and he says he says it like this he says the children were fighting and the sun was going down and the great warrior Joshua when the sun was going down he needed some more time now watch Moses my servant is dead right he's over here fighting this Joshua's fighting in the land right now but although Moses has passed off the scene his message is now coming from prophecy into fulfillment right through the administration of Joshua it's the same Angel of the Lord it hasn't changed when when when when when when Moses was God let him know I'm going to sin before you and then Moses said who is it that thou has said thou with sin with me right God reveals the same Angel of the Lord see God's letting himself know I haven't left you I haven't abandoned you he lets Moses know that I've sent my angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring the end of the place that I prepared for thee is the same Angel of the Lord God here the messenger goes off the scene but here Joshua got moving in a mini-membered body that same Angel of the Lord moving now as Joshua comes up upon Jericho I said this to you before Joshua didn't fight the bottle of Battle of Jericho by just knowing a quote because there was not any quote word for word that ever said go around a city seven times but the god of the message the god of Moses Joshua knew not just the print come on somebody to let her killeth the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life you might be looking for an answer and you're just looking for a letter answer but you say well what do you mean I'm just looking for a letter answer because the spirit of God when he reveals himself he'll never reveal contrary to the letter but he'll reveal himself by his same characteristics and he revealed himself to Joshua and Joshua recognized him but here's Joshua fighting a battle he needs more time the sun the sun is going down he needs the sun to stand up can't you see when the sun was going down and the enemy was going to Prevail and Joshua recognized no the sun can't go down this battle has got to come to a complete victory [Music] as a Joshua in this hour the Church of the Living God who the promise has taken hold on it might look like that the sun would start to go down but there is a people that the day star has arose in our hardship Hallelujah and that day started rising in the hearts of sun stand still amen what is it the life becoming greater more powerful becoming greater it's Christ himself dwelling in our midst the son of man himself and the prophet said it like this and God was in the Battle and Moses hands was up as it were Moses the man was dead but his hands were still up because there was one on earth a vessel of people that that Revelation had caught a hold in and that Revelation in them was not just another horn on the Ram's Head but now the full power coming together the lamb standing in full View and what is it Moses hands are lifted up Calvary lifted up the real reality of redemption the throne The Sovereign that message what is it his hands are lifted up the abstract living out through you is the lifting up of the banner they abstract in you is declaring Jehovah Nissi my life worships at the altar that he has revealed himself he has revealed himself to me in me that he is greater he is my answer to the sin question Hallelujah oh my I believe that was all my heart he's here yes he is he's here dwelling in a many membered body he comes right here right through his word to bring a change in a life yes sir you don't have to wait till the end of a service that same God while the word is coming forth that change can come just like that absolutely but remember God is Sovereign he'll meet you and he meets you personally in a way that there is sacred Sands of Grace that you're able to stand on and no devil can put his dirty foot on those sacred Sands of Grace where you know that you've met God there is a strength within you that though you may get grow weak but there's a strength on the inside of you there are hands inside of you that have never went down there is hands inside of you that can never go down I'm telling you this Mighty Angel his hands are lifted up [Applause] amen this Christ this Holy Ghost Christ in you the hope of glory he that is in you greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world Hallelujah he's brought you forth out of the muck and gone all the mud that was packed into you but he has moved upon your life where there was darkness and water covering your life but the spirit of God has moved on your life to draw you forth and now you are a Lily that expresses his life that life that was hidden there the whole time what is that that's him coming who has dealt with Hamlet from generation to generation he's the same yesterday today and forever his power is still the same Hallelujah hallelujah amen he still delivers he still heals the sick he still cleanses he still feels with the Holy Ghost Hallelujah amen is the right of God that is Hell over the people of God what is that Rod of God the wave chief [Applause] amen it's Christ waved over the people it's not going down because it's him he is the standard in US Jehovah Nissi Banner standard inside rallying point I just witnessed I'm watching the Civil War presentation and a little thing we went to and here the guys were speaking to us saying you know they got rid of the drummers after a while because the guys could not hear tell the difference between the drums and the sounds of guns essentially what they went to was bugles because bugles didn't sound like gunfire but bugles would let you know which way to move and he said you know those swords that They carried on the side he said those swords he said now this is the thing that's different for us and for them those swords he said were not sharp those swords were not used to slice people and so forth they were more ceremonial but in the midst of the battle this is what I want to draw your point to he said in the midst of the battle they couldn't hear the commands but they would find their leader he said because they had the leader would have the sword and he said notice how the Sun Shines off the sword and find their leader in which way the sword was pointing that's the way there to go Hallelujah and the sword of the word doesn't know Nanny retreat for the spirit of the living creatures is in the wheels is that right and everywhere they went they went forward and the word itself now that's what we're looking at Jesus Christ notice they can look up to the hill and Moses hands being lifted up they were gaining strength they were fighting and we see that sword what is it it's the light reflecting off the sword the sword is being held up Oh Glory God who raised up that sword God who gave the sword God Grace provided the sword the prophet just had to put his hands up that's the same thing with you and I all you got to do is put your hands up you put your hands up the sword comes down you put your heart up the hand the sword comes down because then you're saying I Surrender but he himself steps into your life and Through Your Surrender he becomes your strength he becomes your power and you become his glory it's about it I say this friends to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ let God let God do let him move let him prove what he himself has already done and Desiring to come and do let's pray Lord Jesus there's no more Lord that my strength Lord is gone but Lord I realize you have spoke to us today you have made yourself known that it's only you alone deals with amalek nobody else cantame amalek can't tame him there's only one way Lord God and that's for you to deal with him well it's sitting right here this morning no doubt here under my voice some Lord that may be streaming others that would hear the message maybe in another time father I pray this morning Lord God if there's one that's sitting here in our midst Lord that father that doesn't know you in that way I pray that Lord God that this will be the turning point of their life Lord that they would see just how great your curious Lord but you're not more pointing out or picking on weakness or feebleness Lord but father you deal Lord God with the very depths of man in the soul Lord to where you bring it in a reality that we receive Lord and endude with strength life A Love Affair Lord that goes down to the inside or true that sitting right here Lord also speaking to many the Lord no doubt Lord they have already crossed they've put Lord they've been placed into that land that land of adoption Lord started with their soul it'll lead to the very change of the body the Lord it's not saying the Lord that lives and hearts cannot be tempted that's true look at me tinted Lord but father we're in the love of the world is passed away from within Lord it's something that Lord God where there's a resistance against him there's no desire Lord the desire of the world Lord Jesus I believe that that's your intention your purpose that father that you would make known that you are still the same God you're mindful Lord of your word where men Lord have misconstrued it and I don't just say men because it wasn't just men acting on their own accord but Lord where that the enemy has always wanted to try to displace pervert the real true birth the Lord God we see down Through the Ages where men Lord God where that message would go forth they would lift it up Lord by strength Luther lifted it up Lord in justification the Lord God there had to come a greater strength a greater more of the same power into sanctification then more of the same power Lord in the restoration of the gifts and then Lord God more of the same power but now coming in completion in fullness the finishing of the mystery of God Lord Jesus this is the very moments Lord God that all creation has longed in his longing form it's what Lord God that you've longed for Lord Jesus to one day see us Lord God Brian Lord coming down the aisle Lord Hearts have already been United In A Love Affair but yet that groom is going to see that bride dressed in a wedding dress he's going to see her in a garment that he's never saw her in before the Lord unlike unlike us you already saw us in this garment picture of us Lord Lord God then you place that negative there's a pawn there's a negative that's made off of a positive that negative is submitted down here into this Earth Lord but when it's quickened it begins to develop in our life it doesn't all the way look like the complete picture Lord but it continues to develop in our life same way it is the Lord God with every child of God it's that life within us Lord that's developing at first Lord there's a there's a lot of things that can be Lord kind of looks a little fuzzy remember kind of looking at certain things and so forth but Lord God the more that that negative begins to move Lord and begins to Lord come forth that image that's there on the negative made off of the positive continues to become more clear that's the way your life is in US lord it's your strength moving through our weakness Lord it's your strength Lord moving through US Lord to wear things Lord God that once tempted us bothered us the Lord God it grows in our life develops in our life and we grow stronger Lord more and more what we find Lord God is that has you moved in Lord to our soul and we find Lord God by the effects of that new birth we have received the strength to be able to bring this outer man in line with the word of God by your strength by your strength Lord I pray this morning Lord God Lord you will just have your way make your word Lord just further personal Lord as we move into another part of the service make it further personal Lord to each life in each Heart Lord what they would have need of in their life Lord maybe lord it's something Lord that Lord had just trouble the Lord something Lord God the Lord I pray that father May Lord God from within pulling the Lord from that depth of the Lord they don't have that depth within Lord may they receive that this morning and father then from that depth Lord within their soul lord of your life within them in them bringing their life into subjection granted Lord by that inward desire Lord you are our Perfection Lord you are our strength Lord Jesus Lord God I pray that father for each and every one of us Lord we realize the Lord God that it isn't something Lord Jesus that when you Lord have done such a complete work doesn't mean that Lord God that we're not going to have to fight and we're not going to have to battle we are but Lord may we keep every weak place may we keep it covered with the blood of Jesus Christ any feeble area Lord God may we recognize the Lord that it's not sometimes just the area Lord but it's things that contribute help us Lord I pray thank you Lord Jesus granted this morning Lord for every need in the name of Jesus Christ amen Hallelujah now let's stand if you'd like Hallelujah could we just worship him here just a little bit amen just just loving you know this part of the service sometimes I know I've I've kept you a little bit longer here I know that I've got a clock right in front of me here friends listen this is more important than anything else in life it's not it's not about hearing me that's not what I'm talking to you about I'm talking about the word right here that word is more important it's strengthening it's what God does within our life it's this very thing that God can come right back a line around and you don't know what you're going to face this coming week or what you might face coming up but God knows about it he knows and God is mindful he's merciful to give to you what you have need of in your life I encourage any one of you if you don't know the Lord Jesus Christ your savior I encourage you to receive him as your lord and savior if you've not repented I encourage you to repent if you've never been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I encourage you to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that then he can move so fully and freely we in your life to come down and complete that work that he desires to do let's just worship him let let the reign of the Holy Spirit now just let it come and just let it soak down upon that seed you see if you just if you just take a seed a seed's awful hard seed is hard but when you you plant a seed the first thing to tell you to do is water that dirt real good because as you water that real good it actually encloses that moisture around the seed and it's actually that moisture that closes around the seed that'll actually soften and cause that part that is around the seed to begin to give way and then what is inside that seed the pulp and The Germ can actually start to come forth though it's under the ground it's not seen it's not visible it's not heard but it can start to come forth now we realize it's not the organ it's not the piano it's not the drums it's not the guitar it's not the music
