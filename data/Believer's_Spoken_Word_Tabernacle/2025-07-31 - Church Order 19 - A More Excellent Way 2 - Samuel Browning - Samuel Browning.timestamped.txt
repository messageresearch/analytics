[36:20] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[36:23] Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's just go to
[36:25] him in a word of prayer tonight.
[36:28] Heavenly Father,
[36:30] &gt;&gt; truly Lord, that's
[36:33] &gt;&gt; Lord, the resolve in our hearts, Lord.
[36:37] Dear God, many times Lord along this
[36:40] journey
[36:42] we find ourselves Lord in that place
[36:44] that no matter what no matter Lord what
[36:48] we would even feel like
[36:51] but to praise you Father
[36:54] Lord realizing that it's not just the
[36:57] what we would say through our lips yet
[37:00] that itself would require a sacrifice
[37:04] but each and every day of our lives Lord
[37:07] is a to be a praise offering to you,
[37:11] &gt;&gt; Lord, for how that you have swept down
[37:13] in your grace, moved upon our lives,
[37:16] Lord, drawn us to a place of surrender
[37:19] and submission, Lord, and how that you
[37:22] would come in and take complete control
[37:25] in our lives, Lord.
[37:28] Oh, Father, you've changed us, Lord,
[37:31] from what we were,
[37:33] &gt;&gt; every desire of our life, Lord.
[37:36] Oh God, and brought about, Lord, just a
[37:38] real genuine faith in your word.
[37:41] Why shouldn't we praise you, Lord?
[37:45] &gt;&gt; Father, here we, oh God, have such an
[37:48] opportunity that's granted to us, Lord,
[37:50] to worship you, Father, not only, Lord,
[37:53] here, but daily as our lives of praise
[37:56] would go up. Lord, to think how David
[37:59] would write of this many times. Pope
[38:02] Peter would write of it that oftent
[38:04] times Lord it would be the praise that
[38:07] would be offered up. It would be a
[38:09] sacrifice
[38:11] Lord through situations, through
[38:13] circumstances of life, through times
[38:16] Lord I wonder how many times that you
[38:18] come down right here in this services
[38:21] and you know Lord that Father are
[38:24] feeling how things are conditions of
[38:27] life and we would have a right Lord to
[38:31] just say I I'm so overwhelmed I I I I
[38:34] can't worship I'm just so overwhelmed
[38:36] but Lord this sacrifice
[38:39] of praise
[38:42] as David would speak of even the calves
[38:45] of our lips. Let there be an offering of
[38:48] praise, Lord. Let our hearts, our lives,
[38:51] let everything within us, Lord, praise
[38:54] you, Father, no matter the circumstance,
[38:57] Lord, because we know that God, you are
[39:00] in control, Lord. And father, not only
[39:03] do you have the circumstance under
[39:05] control,
[39:06] &gt;&gt; but most importantly, you have us
[39:09] &gt;&gt; in your hands, Lord.
[39:12] &gt;&gt; Oh God, how thankful we are, Lord. We
[39:15] pray, heavenly father, that once again
[39:17] that you would just come among us in a
[39:19] very special way, Lord. Speak to us, I
[39:22] pray, Father, through your word. Just
[39:25] guide us, Lord, on what is to be said,
[39:27] Father.
[39:28] May you just Lord speak to our hearts in
[39:31] a special way. How we thank you Lord for
[39:34] moving upon so many needs Lord among us
[39:37] Lord. Oh God, we want to say thank you,
[39:40] Father. Lord, the different requests,
[39:42] Lord, that's went out here, Father, even
[39:44] over the last month and a half, Lord.
[39:47] Different requests, serious needs, Lord.
[39:50] But oh God, how we're so thankful, Lord.
[39:53] So thankful, God, for your mercy, Lord,
[39:56] for each one, Lord. Oh, I thank you,
[39:58] Father, for God, Lord, moving on the
[40:01] scene for Elamine, Lord. I thank you for
[40:04] that, Lord. I thank you father for just
[40:07] moving Lord for sister Irma Lord. Thank
[40:10] you Lord for touching our sister Lord
[40:12] and restoring her Lord and Lord God back
[40:15] to us Lord. And we thank you for your
[40:18] mercy Lord. Oh God thank you Father for
[40:21] touching Marco's life Lord for moving
[40:24] for him Lord. Oh God many of these
[40:27] situations Lord things could have went a
[40:30] much different way but Lord it was your
[40:33] mercy Lord.
[40:36] Oh God, help us Lord,
[40:39] we want to say thank you, Father. Thank
[40:42] you for your mercy once again in Jesus
[40:45] name.
[40:46] &gt;&gt; Amen and amen.
[40:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you tonight. Amen. We
[40:54] &gt;&gt; certainly want to say it's good to be
[40:55] back home and uh
[40:58] we want to turn our hearts right into
[41:00] the word and so thank you for your
[41:03] prayers. And I know there was wonderful
[41:06] services while we were away and the Lord
[41:08] just moved upon many different needs and
[41:11] so thankful for that as well. And um so
[41:15] we just want to take a take a look here
[41:18] just a little bit more this evening
[41:21] in the word of the Lord. And I want to
[41:23] go into 1 Corinthians 12 once again and
[41:26] pick up with here on these in these
[41:29] verses.
[41:31] And Paul would write, "Now ye are the
[41:34] body of Christ and members in
[41:38] particular,
[41:40] and God hath set some in the church."
[41:42] Now, these are the he's Paul's going to
[41:44] deal with offices and gifts. And God
[41:48] hath set some in the church. First
[41:51] apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly
[41:55] teachers, after that miracles and gifts
[41:58] of healings, helps, governments,
[42:01] diversities of tongues,
[42:04] and then he says in verse 29, "Are all
[42:08] apostles?
[42:10] Are all prophets?
[42:12] Are all teachers?
[42:15] Are all workers of miracles?
[42:18] Have all the gifts of healing? Do all
[42:22] speak with tongues? Do all interpret?
[42:24] Now, you're aware of where Paul was at
[42:27] just right previous to these verses of
[42:29] scripture. He's dealing with the body
[42:31] and how that God has so set the body
[42:34] together in every member of the body,
[42:36] even bestowing more honor upon the
[42:40] unbecoming parts of the body. And how
[42:43] that God would so do that. but yet
[42:45] showing that for each and every one of
[42:47] us there is a part in the body of Jesus
[42:50] Christ. How many believe you have a
[42:51] part?
[42:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:53] &gt;&gt; And I believe God makes known that part.
[42:55] God will make known the part. Sometimes
[42:57] we're looking for a certain thing. And
[42:58] as a matter of fact, brother Braman says
[43:00] it like this in the message. He said God
[43:02] usually has to drive us into the right
[43:05] part that he has for us. I think that's
[43:09] incredible. Drive us into that place.
[43:12] Brother Bram talks to one one brother
[43:14] who is standing there in the tabernacle
[43:16] at one point in time. And that brother,
[43:18] you know, is kind of struggling with his
[43:19] purpose and his part. And brother Bram
[43:21] just stops and he tells him, he says,
[43:23] "Brother," he says, "I believe," he
[43:24] said, "if you'll you see how God has
[43:26] used you within singing." He said, "If
[43:29] you'll just yield to that," he said,
[43:30] "that's what your part is in the body."
[43:34] And yet the man, no doubt, he was he was
[43:36] trying. I just had heard even a
[43:37] testimony. It took me back to that quote
[43:39] where someone was talking about that and
[43:41] I thought how incredible how that man
[43:43] was actually looking at some other part
[43:46] in the body. And yet God's grace would
[43:49] bring such a relief to his life to
[43:51] realize that something that maybe he was
[43:53] inclining or looking at that that's not
[43:55] what God had at all for him. You talking
[43:58] about a rest and what that would be.
[44:00] It's almost sound like a a balloon going
[44:02] off
[44:05] &gt;&gt; because it wasn't something we realiz in
[44:07] anything God has for us, any part, any
[44:09] purpose, we don't ever have to push our
[44:11] way in or make our our way. The Bible
[44:13] said, "Every gift maketh room for
[44:16] itself." Amen. So, let's look here in
[44:19] verse 31. I love this. says, "But covet
[44:22] earnestly the best gifts, and yet show I
[44:27] unto you a more excellent way." A more
[44:31] excellent way. And if the Lord will help
[44:32] us, I want to just speak once again here
[44:34] tonight on this part of a more excellent
[44:37] way. May God bless you and bless the
[44:39] reading of the word as you're being
[44:40] seated.
[44:45] I realize that um when we as we look and
[44:49] have looked over these things in many in
[44:51] many times that we understand that we've
[44:55] you never grow beyond God's word or
[44:58] whatever or what that God has placed
[45:00] within the church. It still has a place.
[45:03] It still has a part within the church.
[45:05] And yet sometimes men, and I don't
[45:08] believe men would do it in a manner to
[45:11] be wrong, but sometimes they maybe can
[45:14] begin to place emphasis on things above
[45:19] other things in in the word of God and
[45:21] begin to look at it. And one of the
[45:23] reasons that that would be is many times
[45:25] that the human being, the prophet tells
[45:27] us, even how we're made as human beings,
[45:30] we are drawn to that of the
[45:32] supernatural. Even you see this out here
[45:34] among many of the people and they'll
[45:37] look at all the the phenomenal. You'll
[45:39] see things to where that I never forget
[45:41] we went through Gettysburg and here we
[45:43] were and a couple times and they're
[45:45] promising these tours in Gettysburg
[45:47] where there would you know to be
[45:49] sightings of ghost and everything else
[45:51] and you see people that are drawn to
[45:52] that
[45:53] &gt;&gt; and and that's not even the truth and
[45:55] you we we understand we have
[45:57] understanding of that you know as the
[45:59] prophet would even teach us on that but
[46:01] yet there's a part of it that even as
[46:04] I'll say as believers that we're drawn
[46:07] to that of the supernatural natural. And
[46:09] yet the scriptures are so clear to us
[46:11] that where the Bible tells us that we
[46:14] are not to seek after signs and wonders
[46:17] and miracles, but yet they follow the
[46:20] believer. The greatest sign and wonder
[46:22] that can follow your life or my life is
[46:24] that we're a believer. Is that the seal
[46:27] of the living God, remember a seal, it
[46:29] shows coming and going. That's the
[46:31] greatest testament that we can have. And
[46:34] I think how brother Brandon would say it
[46:35] in Kinsman Redeemer when he would talk
[46:37] about those handfuls of purpose and he
[46:39] would say, "God, let every once in a
[46:41] while a miracle. Let something happen
[46:43] among us. Every once in a while, Lord,
[46:46] just to let us know that you're among
[46:48] us." Now, could God do that every single
[46:51] service? He could. Could God do it every
[46:53] single day of our life? He could. But
[46:56] there's a measure of it. And God knows
[46:58] the measure. It's not regulated by man.
[47:00] But God wants our lives to walk with
[47:03] such a trust in him to where when we
[47:06] don't feel him, we don't see him.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; Yet there is a trust in his word and
[47:12] what he said because he said it.
[47:15] Even when you don't have any word about
[47:18] maybe a sickness or an illness or a
[47:21] situation, you don't even have any word
[47:23] that's dropped to you where God has
[47:26] given a specific order, but yet you have
[47:28] the general orders that says they shall
[47:30] lay hands on the sick and they shall
[47:32] recover. We can stand upon God's word
[47:35] and that actually that's the greatest
[47:37] achievement that could ever be had is
[47:40] God bringing a people in this hour to
[47:43] believe him for what he has said. Does
[47:46] God give us divine assistance? He does.
[47:48] God knows exactly when when what you and
[47:51] I have need of and when we have need of
[47:53] it. But yet building us to such a place
[47:56] to where in our lives our confidence is
[48:00] in him and he is the word. And so when
[48:03] we consider this on that of a more
[48:06] excellent way, you know, Paul was not
[48:09] taking the church away from gifts, but
[48:12] he saw that where that the people were
[48:15] resting. They were resting their
[48:16] experiences. They were resting who they
[48:18] are. And they were they were resting
[48:20] upon these things. So much so to where
[48:23] that even when it would become into
[48:26] services that they felt like in times
[48:28] that they had to do this, one has a
[48:31] psalm, one has a revelation, one has a
[48:33] this and they really felt that way. And
[48:36] you know, God doesn't want us to live in
[48:38] a manner of uncertainty or confusion or
[48:42] condemnation. But Paul would be led by
[48:44] the spirit of God to go down and begin
[48:47] to place that and give the order and the
[48:49] appropriate times for these things to be
[48:52] released within the body. And I believe
[48:55] as as the prophet taught us that he
[48:57] says, you know, you do have control of
[48:59] the Holy Spirit. So the Holy Spirit is
[49:02] it that that that whole part of being
[49:04] led by the spirit of God is not a
[49:06] Pentecostal idea which it is an idea
[49:09] that well I'll just do whatever when the
[49:11] spirit of God comes upon me. But the
[49:13] prophet taught us that we actually have
[49:16] control. Now control is different from
[49:19] quenching because quenching would be to
[49:21] where it's just completely stifled
[49:23] altogether. But control operates within
[49:27] the divine prescribed order of God's
[49:30] word. And there's a place of safety
[49:33] within that. That's why brother Bam
[49:34] tells us even he said you might feel
[49:36] like shouting and you're right in front
[49:38] of the president of the United States.
[49:39] He said you realize that's not the time
[49:41] to do that. He said you might break out.
[49:44] You might be in a courtroom and he said
[49:46] it moves upon you to speak in tongues.
[49:48] He said but you realize that's not the
[49:49] right place to do that. He said there's
[49:53] a proper time and place. So it brings us
[49:55] to understand we do have a control and
[49:58] that control is not quenching. It's just
[50:01] releasing it at the right time. It's
[50:03] kind of like you have a garden hose and
[50:05] you're hooked up, you know, to the to
[50:07] that of the hose. You know when to
[50:08] release it. You don't release it when
[50:10] somebody's sitting in a chair that's
[50:12] right there. You wait till you get by
[50:13] and get over to your flower pots and you
[50:15] release it. You've got a hold of it. And
[50:18] that whole releasing of it is knowing
[50:20] even when to yield to the spirit of God.
[50:23] I'm glad that God deals with us that
[50:25] way. Aren't you? It's to alleviate
[50:27] confusion and to bring and to to give us
[50:30] a place of real rest so that we're not
[50:32] walking in a place of condemned or I
[50:35] should have done this or I should have
[50:36] done that and I should have. But I'm so
[50:37] thankful that God leads us in that way
[50:40] and brings a real settleness in our
[50:42] heart. So when we look at this of a more
[50:44] excellent way and this whole word way it
[50:46] appears many times in the scriptures but
[50:48] it's actually a road or a traveled way.
[50:52] It's a a traveling or a journey. It's a
[50:54] course of conduct a way a manner of
[50:57] thinking, feeling or deciding. Now you
[51:00] know when when we um we we flew to Texas
[51:03] and we didn't drive. That's that's too
[51:05] long of a drive for me. I mean it gets
[51:07] beyond eight hours. That's that's
[51:08] pushing it. That's just me. But I I'm
[51:10] just I know there's I've got I've got
[51:12] buddies and friends, they like to drive.
[51:13] I I I just I like to get in. Don't like
[51:15] to have to worry about it. Fly me there
[51:17] and fly me back. But you know, when you
[51:19] you look at it, you when you if I were
[51:21] to drive to Amarillo or Columbus or
[51:23] Bluton or wherever, you know, there's
[51:25] many ways you can take you got a choice.
[51:28] I mean, you can go the highway, you can
[51:30] go the back roads, you can go country
[51:32] roads. It's like sometimes when I'm and
[51:34] I'm going to Jeffersonville or down to
[51:36] Louisville or whatever, sometimes it
[51:38] most of the time it'll take me down 58.
[51:39] If I have to go over and get gas over at
[51:42] Sam's Club or Costco, it'll a lot of
[51:44] times put me on the turnpike, route me
[51:46] over to 71, then drop me down. But a lot
[51:49] of times from my house, it'll take me
[51:51] right down 58, may split me off on 89,
[51:53] 250 to 71. But long story short, I'm
[51:57] going to get there. But you see what God
[52:00] when he's speaking here, he just does
[52:02] not say that this is one of the more
[52:05] excellent ways. But there is this is the
[52:09] excellent way. And we know that that the
[52:11] way we're talking about is Jesus Christ
[52:14] and it is the word.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; And so we always know we're safe when
[52:18] we're abiding in the word. And this is
[52:21] this is the way that God has set. So
[52:23] this way it's really it's not an
[52:25] optional. It's not like power power, you
[52:28] know, I know anymore power windows and
[52:29] doors. I I was talking to some people
[52:31] here. Uh I think my boys and some others
[52:34] we were talking about it. Man, it used
[52:35] to be optional. You used to thought you
[52:37] were, man, good if you got a car that
[52:40] had power windows in it. Power door
[52:42] locks was good because you didn't have
[52:44] to reach across to try to unlock that
[52:46] door for whoever's getting in. But now
[52:48] it's a lot of those things are just
[52:49] standard, you know, that come on a car.
[52:51] Even when I remember, you know, having a
[52:53] tape deck in a car and uh you young
[52:56] people, we'll show you what that is. But
[53:00] that was special.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; You look for those things. and even
[53:03] having heating and air conditioning in
[53:05] the car. Now, they don't even look for
[53:07] heating and air conditioning. They want
[53:08] to see not even any more heated seats.
[53:10] They want to see, does this have cooled
[53:11] seats, too?
[53:14] &gt;&gt; Man, how things have come a long way.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; Pretty soon, I'm thinking it's going to
[53:18] have hands that'll reach out and massage
[53:19] your back.
[53:22] That'd be nice, wouldn't it?
[53:24] &gt;&gt; But, you know, when we look at this,
[53:26] this is not an this is not an optional
[53:28] way. But it's like this with God. God
[53:31] never um he never demands anything but
[53:35] he is showing us the proper way and the
[53:38] proper channel that it is not a gift
[53:42] plus love but it is the love of God in
[53:44] our hearts which is the Holy Spirit and
[53:47] we operate by the love of God. Whether
[53:51] there is a a a gift in our life, a
[53:53] church gift or an office in our life of
[53:56] apostle, prophet, teacher, whatever it
[53:58] might be, we want the very the very
[54:00] basis of our life is to be based on
[54:04] divine love. The love of God that God
[54:08] loved me and he gave himself for me. And
[54:12] now that love is what's resting in my
[54:14] bosom. And whether I ever preach again
[54:17] or not, I know he loves me. whether I do
[54:21] anything else or not, I know he loves
[54:23] me.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; Is that all right?
[54:26] &gt;&gt; So, it's not it removes it then from
[54:28] anything of of works or anything that we
[54:30] would do. Yet, works shows forth our
[54:33] appreciation for what God has done for
[54:36] us. And we always want to be in that
[54:37] place. I know I've said this a lot here
[54:39] over the past years, but it's very true.
[54:42] We always want to be a channel that's
[54:45] available and open to God. And that's
[54:48] that's the thing that when God spoke
[54:49] about Job, he was a dedicated channel.
[54:52] And I don't want to be a dedicated
[54:54] channel to carry, you know, garbage. I
[54:56] don't want to be a dedicated channel for
[54:58] the NFL. I don't want to be a dedicated
[55:00] channel for sports. I don't want to be a
[55:02] dedicated channel for gossip. I don't
[55:04] want to be a dedicated channel for, you
[55:05] know, a grudge. I don't want to be a
[55:07] dedicated channel for bitterness. I want
[55:09] to be a dedicated channel for the love
[55:11] of God.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; That's what I want to be because that's
[55:14] where God can move into. And the prophet
[55:16] said that is a channel that faith can
[55:18] move into. And that's what we are
[55:21] looking for is that rapturing faith.
[55:24] It's going to move in the final
[55:26] quickening. One of these days, one of
[55:28] these moments, it'll move in. I just
[55:30] want to say one of these moments it'll
[55:32] move in the final quickening in that
[55:34] moment.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It wasn't Adam. It wasn't
[55:37] Abraham that provided the ram. God
[55:39] provided the ram. The only thing for you
[55:41] and I is to stay faithful to God's word.
[55:43] And so there's the right pursuit. This
[55:45] is what Paul was speaking of the right
[55:48] pursuit within this. And you know this
[55:51] is where Paul would write after uh uh
[55:53] chapter 13 follow after charity and
[55:57] desire spiritual gifts but rather that
[56:00] you may prophesy that which would would
[56:03] edify. But notice follow pursue it. Let
[56:07] you say, "Well, brother Samuel, if if if
[56:09] charity, which is the agape love, God's
[56:12] own love, and which is who God is, if
[56:15] that's dwelling in my life, then why
[56:17] should I pursue that?" Well, first of
[56:20] all, we always have to examine, is it
[56:22] dwelling in our lives? And if it is
[56:25] dwelling in our lives, we want more of
[56:28] it. And we want more of it to take over
[56:31] more of us.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; We need more. We need more in this hour
[56:37] than we had the previous hour.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; We need more now. It's going to take
[56:41] more now. As a matter of fact, the
[56:43] prophet said it would take perfect love
[56:45] to make it there.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; And so, we need, we see it, even God,
[56:51] you know, God allows things to arise
[56:54] around us uh to bring us to the reality
[56:58] that we need more of the love of God in
[57:01] our lives. And you know really what it
[57:03] is, it's not putting something on on the
[57:05] outside, but Paul writes of it in
[57:08] Colossians and he says put on or sink
[57:11] into. He writes it in Ephesians 2. So
[57:14] it's us shrinking in or moving or
[57:18] submitting to the love of God in our
[57:20] life and allowing God's love to step
[57:22] forward. That's what happened with the
[57:25] bull in the pasture.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; That's what happened with the hornets.
[57:28] Remember, brother Ram said, he said, "If
[57:30] I'd have been next to that shed with
[57:31] them hornets, I had a can of hornet
[57:33] spray." I wonder how many other hornets
[57:35] got blasted.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; They was in the shed. Brother Ram never
[57:39] said, "I went in the shed and got rid of
[57:40] my hornet spray after that." Are you
[57:42] hearing me?
[57:44] &gt;&gt; And the same thing about the bull.
[57:45] Brother Bram told us if he'd have known
[57:47] that bull was in that pasture, he
[57:48] wouldn't have walked there. So, we we
[57:50] we're not here to prove anything.
[57:51] Brother Brandham wasn't trying to prove
[57:53] something. If brother Brandon would have
[57:54] walked into that pastor trying to prove
[57:56] something, it would have already been
[57:58] the wrong motive and wrong objective.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; Is that right? And the love of God will
[58:05] not produce the wrong the wrong motive
[58:08] and wrong objective.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; Right? So then when we're looking at
[58:12] this with divine love within our lives
[58:15] that you know I would say that there was
[58:17] no doubt believers setting in
[58:19] Corinthians you know that maybe they
[58:22] hadn't been used to speak in tongues
[58:23] maybe maybe they you know they hadn't
[58:25] not not one of the you know gifts that
[58:27] like brother said milling throughout the
[58:29] body following this one the night maybe
[58:30] never again following this one the night
[58:32] never again then there might have been
[58:33] those that you know they they didn't
[58:34] have any ministerial any church office
[58:36] there was nothing like that and man here
[58:38] they were they they were looked at as
[58:40] maybe simple believers. But God through
[58:43] his word would bring it that the body
[58:45] God has so set the body together that
[58:48] one part of the body is not to look down
[58:51] or look up to another part of the body
[58:53] but every member of the body is working
[58:57] together with one unity and one purpose.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:03] Yes.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; My what a relief that would have been to
[59:06] th to those believers in that hour to
[59:08] realize that you know what that I may
[59:10] not be gifted in this way or up to this
[59:12] point God that that gift that would be
[59:14] milling through the body has not fallen
[59:16] on me. So then then they they could rest
[59:19] in that place that you know what it it
[59:21] isn't that I ever have to do anything.
[59:23] You you may never walk on the water. You
[59:25] may you may never be used in a certain
[59:27] capacity but it does not matter. Your
[59:29] life is being used in the greatest
[59:32] capacity to be a testimony of Jesus
[59:35] Christ.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; That's so good.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; Because let me just tell you, there's
[59:42] many that have great gifts
[59:45] &gt;&gt; and are not even in the bride.
[59:49] There's many ministering gifts that have
[59:52] been TV evangelists been others have
[59:55] been have had great gifts and some of
[59:58] them the things that that what it turns
[59:59] out to be. I'm not what I'm trying to
[1:00:02] say is this is where the prophet was
[1:00:04] saying is that we don't chase after
[1:00:07] gifts.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; We don't even chase after the
[1:00:11] supernatural. We believe in the
[1:00:13] supernatural
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; and to have a discernment and to
[1:00:16] recognize that within that oil that a
[1:00:19] gift itself can operate. But a gift is
[1:00:22] not a signification that that is a
[1:00:26] spiritfilled
[1:00:27] individual.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; The prophet taught us that. He said,
[1:00:33] notice in the Pergamian age, he said
[1:00:36] Jesus never did put emphasis on the
[1:00:39] works. He knew if the people got the
[1:00:43] word that the works would follow the
[1:00:46] word.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; And the word is not the letter. The word
[1:00:50] is the person of Jesus Christ.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit is not something
[1:00:56] separate from the word or greater than
[1:00:58] the word. The Holy Spirit is the word
[1:01:02] himself.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; That's why we are born of the word which
[1:01:06] is the spirit.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why we can't be filled with
[1:01:12] the spirit of God and disagree with the
[1:01:14] word.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; Because this Holy Spirit is the spirit
[1:01:19] of truth.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; So the right pursuit. What are the
[1:01:24] things that that we're pursuing? Watch
[1:01:26] how brother Brown would say this in 1958
[1:01:29] here in the church order message. She
[1:01:30] said, "I think first that every member
[1:01:33] or every worshipper of the Brandham
[1:01:35] tabernacle should be so much in divine
[1:01:38] love with each other until their hearts
[1:01:43] would long for each other
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; when they have to go away to leave each
[1:01:50] other at the service at night." He said,
[1:01:53] "I'm a true believer in divine love."
[1:01:55] Right.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; And you know, one thing that's good is
[1:01:59] when we can read the word of God and we
[1:02:02] can take the grace of God that comes to
[1:02:05] us with a good courage and stand and
[1:02:07] even to look at a quote like this and
[1:02:09] say, "God, help me."
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; Because we're not here for a show.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; We're not here just to say amen to the
[1:02:19] word because it's right.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; We're here saying amen to say so be it.
[1:02:24] and that our lives would be examined by
[1:02:26] the word of God.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; And there might be other things that's
[1:02:30] come into that way and maybe our feeling
[1:02:32] is not there within that way. And then
[1:02:34] the spirit of God, we can invite him
[1:02:36] according to his word and say, "Lord,
[1:02:38] create that in me. Lord, I want to sink
[1:02:40] deeper into the love of God in my life."
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; I think we all would look at this and
[1:02:46] agree that within all of this here, we
[1:02:49] could all say, "Amen." that every
[1:02:51] member, every worshipper first be so in
[1:02:53] love. But you realize that even when we
[1:02:56] look at this in 1 Corinthians 13, and I
[1:02:59] could have read all the different uh
[1:03:01] attribute expressions of divine love
[1:03:03] tonight, but I I'm not going to do that
[1:03:06] because we don't want you even chasing
[1:03:08] after to try to obtain an attribute.
[1:03:12] Rather, let it be divine love, the
[1:03:14] person of Jesus Christ himself. And then
[1:03:18] from him will come the patience. From
[1:03:21] him comes longsuffering.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; So you see, it's not something I'm
[1:03:25] reaching out to. Sure, we want the word
[1:03:27] to examine us and say, "Lord, I need
[1:03:29] more patience.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; I need to be more long-suffering. I I
[1:03:33] need Lord, I I I need to go through my
[1:03:36] file cabinet because I'm keeping too
[1:03:37] many records on people.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; That's good. That's good."
[1:03:41] When somebody brings up their name
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; and we come out with the same feeling
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; as we had 20 years ago,
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; something's wrong. We need to deal with
[1:03:51] that file. But you'll never deal with it
[1:03:54] without them inviting the blood of Jesus
[1:03:57] Christ. And the way you invite it is to
[1:04:00] remember what the blood did for you
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; and what it's still doing for you. It'll
[1:04:06] take care of that file. Now, it won't
[1:04:09] strip it out of your memory, but it'll
[1:04:11] no longer allow it to be that anointing
[1:04:13] that's there that will manifest that
[1:04:16] offensive grudge and that resentment,
[1:04:18] but it will deal with that.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; You say, "Why did that even have to
[1:04:23] happen?" God's got to have situations
[1:04:25] that he can take and lives
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; and he can manifest his victory through
[1:04:31] your life and my life. And we no one no
[1:04:34] one will stand there on that day and
[1:04:35] said, "Well, if id have just had a
[1:04:37] perfect run, if id had perfect parents,
[1:04:39] if id had a perfect church, if I'd have
[1:04:40] had a perfect pastor, if id had a
[1:04:42] perfect this, if I'd have had a perfect
[1:04:44] this, if id had a perfect this, there
[1:04:46] will be nobody, no excuse on that day
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; for why anybody missed it
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; and why they couldn't live a victorious
[1:04:55] life."
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you friends, there's no
[1:04:59] complex. There's no situation. I don't
[1:05:02] care what somebody's done. If you're a
[1:05:03] son of daughter of God, you always were.
[1:05:06] And you're always in charge.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; If you allow it to rain over your life,
[1:05:11] that's your choice.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; That ain't nobody else's choice.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; That's your choice.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; But God has provided a bleach to take
[1:05:20] care of those things.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; God has provided grace.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; Depends on what you want to keep up.
[1:05:27] like that little like that little woman.
[1:05:29] She you know she brought uh she brought
[1:05:32] you know one of the generals was there.
[1:05:33] I think it was General Lee. She brought
[1:05:35] him down and man she brought him down.
[1:05:37] Come here. I want to show you a tree.
[1:05:38] Got back over there and showed him a
[1:05:40] tree. This tree was riddled with bullet
[1:05:42] holes. It was a mess. It was one of her
[1:05:44] favorite trees. And she said she got him
[1:05:47] back there. Now the war is already over.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; I know sometimes in the south they don't
[1:05:52] know that but it's over.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; That was just a little That was just to
[1:05:57] get you smiling.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; General Lee stood there and looked at
[1:06:02] that tree and this woman was going on
[1:06:04] and on about them Union soldiers and
[1:06:06] everything else. She said, "What do you
[1:06:08] think?"
[1:06:10] He said, "Cut it down and burn it.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; That's what you do to it."
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; Because this tree was a reminder to her.
[1:06:22] Sometimes, listen friends, we got a
[1:06:24] choice over what we allow to be kept in
[1:06:27] our lives.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; But you can't do it, you can't do it
[1:06:32] with human love.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; You can't take things out of your life
[1:06:37] with human love.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; It takes the love of God.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; It takes the love of God.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; My my my my
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; follow after charity. So it isn't
[1:06:52] something putting on and oh my you know
[1:06:54] we're going to we got a machine back
[1:06:56] there and you know you run through it
[1:06:57] and we'll just it just sprinkles that
[1:06:59] powdered sugar. Well, it's like I told
[1:07:02] them there in Texas if there's things
[1:07:03] that's not genuine. I said forgive me
[1:07:05] but I couldn't think of any other
[1:07:07] example. I said it's like putting
[1:07:08] homemade icing on a storebought cake.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; I don't like storebought cakes. They're
[1:07:16] made with oils that tear me up. I
[1:07:19] but you get what I'm talking about,
[1:07:21] friends. If you like storebought cake,
[1:07:22] fine. Fine. That's okay. That you can
[1:07:24] eat your storebought cake. But I think
[1:07:25] you need to get you get what I'm talking
[1:07:27] about. Is that when it's not something
[1:07:29] that God's asking us to put on?
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; Divine love is not something that's put
[1:07:34] on. You can't put on divine love. Divine
[1:07:37] love must come from that hidden source
[1:07:41] of the love of God himself.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's what happened on the
[1:07:48] platform. That's what happens in our
[1:07:50] lives. This is why brother Bra would say
[1:07:52] in questions and answers on the Holy
[1:07:53] Ghost. He said, "Here's the way the
[1:07:55] church is set up in a Pentecostal
[1:07:57] church. If I was pastoring this church,
[1:07:58] I tell you what I would set it up if I
[1:08:00] could be here all the time as the
[1:08:02] pastor. I would subscribe to every gift
[1:08:04] in the Bible."
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; Well, I believe in saying what he said.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; Not only every non-spiritual gift, but
[1:08:12] here's the prophet.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; He's ascribed to every gift that's in
[1:08:15] the Bible. He still believed in pastors.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; It wasn't in parenthesis that they had
[1:08:20] to only sit down and push play.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; This is what this is what the prophet
[1:08:25] stood for. It was restoring the true
[1:08:29] apostolic gospel.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; It was bringing and tearing down the
[1:08:34] veils where Satan wanted to put up
[1:08:36] veils. In other words, he wants to try
[1:08:38] to get things between God and his
[1:08:41] people. And God sent the message in this
[1:08:44] hour. And the message is not the idea of
[1:08:46] William Brham. The message is Jesus
[1:08:49] Christ.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; A true reflection from the throne of
[1:08:55] almighty God.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet said, "Don't you
[1:08:59] ever let anything get between you and
[1:09:01] that word."
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Keep the pathway clear. Feelings,
[1:09:06] whatever it is, don't let anybody,
[1:09:07] person, a personality, don't let nobody
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; get between you and that word.
[1:09:14] in relationship, whatever it is, keep
[1:09:16] that clear.
[1:09:19] Tell believers first to be baptized in
[1:09:22] the Holy Ghost.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; See, when we're then in Christ, it's
[1:09:27] Christ he has set in the church.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; It's God's working.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; Right? Remember, brother Bam would tell
[1:09:33] many of those young men that they would
[1:09:35] become enthused
[1:09:38] and inspired
[1:09:40] and they would do we go now and go seek
[1:09:43] after gifts. Brother Ram said, "Don't do
[1:09:45] it. You only make yourself a stuffed
[1:09:48] shirt."
[1:09:50] Now listen, when you could look at that,
[1:09:53] what would be a a a commending thing for
[1:09:56] maybe a young person, man, because we
[1:09:58] got young people all around that, you
[1:10:00] know, they want to be like these
[1:10:02] basketball stars or football stars or or
[1:10:05] whatever more or other things. But, you
[1:10:08] know, I think it's a wonderful thing to
[1:10:10] be enthused or inspired. I remember
[1:10:12] brother Tim Puit tells that when he was
[1:10:14] just a a real young boy. He went he was
[1:10:16] in brother Bram's meeting and man, he
[1:10:17] was there. He knew right there in his
[1:10:19] heart, I I want to be a preacher. He
[1:10:20] went and got a suit and had a Bible and
[1:10:22] everything else. Of course, you know,
[1:10:23] God's done the work and proved it all
[1:10:24] out. But what I'm saying is is that
[1:10:26] everything itself, you know, there's
[1:10:28] times where there's enthusiasm, but we
[1:10:31] always want to allow our enthusiasm to
[1:10:33] be placed under the word.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; Enthusiasm is zeal.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; We always want it to be under the word
[1:10:40] of God. Is that right?
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; Because if it can't come under God's
[1:10:45] word, then it's not needed. Right?
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; It only it's needed when it submits and
[1:10:51] operates under God's word. That's why
[1:10:53] you know even in this hour the ministry
[1:10:55] in this hour Ephesians 4 must come under
[1:10:59] the anointing of Malachi 4.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? That's why another
[1:11:04] message won't work.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; An idea. That's why we're not just
[1:11:08] preaching scriptures.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; We're preaching the light of the word
[1:11:13] from the scriptures.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; We're not left to our own devices. We're
[1:11:17] not left to wondering. We're not left to
[1:11:19] our own understanding. It is God that
[1:11:22] has come down. The mind of Christ that
[1:11:24] is set down in this hour. And I say,
[1:11:26] "Thanks be to God for a word in this
[1:11:29] hour that gives you and I a real
[1:11:31] direction and a liberty. It is an
[1:11:33] anointing upon our life."
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; And that anointing is Christ.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; Before Aaron and them could ever
[1:11:41] minister, they had to come and be washed
[1:11:44] by the prophet. Is that right? washed by
[1:11:46] the water of the word.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; And I think those are things that you we
[1:11:51] evaluate, we look at closely. Remember
[1:11:53] remember what Paul said in the Ephesian
[1:11:56] age. He said that thou hast tried them
[1:11:59] tried them that called themselves
[1:12:02] apostles and has found them to be false.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; Now, how did they try them? Did they
[1:12:09] bring a tribunal? Did they bring them
[1:12:11] up, you know, and you know, and where
[1:12:13] they're, you know, like like a court?
[1:12:14] No. No. They they they know what it was
[1:12:16] is the prophet told us they simply
[1:12:18] looked at what was being said and said
[1:12:21] the prophet Paul never said that
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; you're saying something contrary to
[1:12:30] Paul. Well, brother Samuel, don't you
[1:12:31] think I ain't got a thought coming and
[1:12:34] neither do you.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; I'm not here to preach my thoughts.
[1:12:38] We're not going in a rapture by our
[1:12:40] thoughts. It's his thoughts. As a matter
[1:12:41] of fact, what changed our lives is his
[1:12:44] thoughts.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; That's always a real key to me. Don't
[1:12:48] you think? No, no, no. I don't want to.
[1:12:49] No, no. It ain't about what I think.
[1:12:50] We're not here to reason. We're not It's
[1:12:52] not a group of men. God delivered us out
[1:12:55] of the camps of man of what do you think
[1:12:58] and what do you think? God sent us a
[1:13:00] message to bring us into his camp. And
[1:13:04] we've got to go beyond our own camp
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; and into the camp of the supernatural
[1:13:09] God
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; who performs his word.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; So when we look at this, watch in the
[1:13:18] scripture here, you see, because we
[1:13:21] understand that when we're looking at
[1:13:23] this that divine love that God is love.
[1:13:26] So I want let's just read a few
[1:13:27] scriptures here. The Bible tells us in 1
[1:13:30] John 4 and verse 7, beloved, let us love
[1:13:33] one another. Now that word is agape.
[1:13:38] Let us love one another. For love is of
[1:13:40] God. And everyone that loveth is born of
[1:13:44] God and knoweth God. And he that loveth
[1:13:48] not knoweth not God. For God is love.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:56] Now when we we understand that this love
[1:14:00] that we're talking about that is
[1:14:02] speaking of here Paul's not talking
[1:14:03] about felio love
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; but he's talking about agape love which
[1:14:08] is God himself God's own life God's own
[1:14:11] nature and you and I could not get to
[1:14:14] that we man in himself could not express
[1:14:18] that purity that's the purity of love
[1:14:21] because from there it comes all the way
[1:14:23] on down to where we're at in filio and
[1:14:25] goes all the way on down as the prophet
[1:14:27] said into that of filth.
[1:14:30] That's a stream of love. But you and I
[1:14:33] could not get back into that place. But
[1:14:35] it was the love of God that came down
[1:14:39] for you and I.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; It was the love of God. What brought him
[1:14:44] down for you and I? Not because that our
[1:14:47] condition was lovable.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; It was that which was beneath all of the
[1:14:54] condition. Right?
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; God did not feel our condition. He
[1:14:58] didn't like our condition.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; He didn't like But he loved us. What was
[1:15:05] it that he loved? He loved that part.
[1:15:07] That part which is of himself, that's
[1:15:10] what he came to redeem.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; Because once you get that part in order,
[1:15:15] and once that part comes back in line
[1:15:17] with God, then the rest of it will line
[1:15:19] up under the authority of a manifested
[1:15:22] son and daughter of God.
[1:15:27] Now notice in this was manifested the
[1:15:30] love of God toward us
[1:15:35] because that God sent his only begotten
[1:15:37] son into the world that we might live
[1:15:41] through him. herein is love. Not that we
[1:15:46] loved God, but that he loved us and sent
[1:15:50] his son to be the propitiation for our
[1:15:54] sins.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; I tell you, this is a glorious
[1:15:58] revelation right here.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; The revelation of Jesus Christ is the
[1:16:03] new birth to you personally.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; It's a revelation of God's love.
[1:16:08] Remember the prophet said, "Oh," he
[1:16:10] said, "I always used to think that God
[1:16:12] hated me, but Jesus loved me." He said,
[1:16:14] "But one day I found out they're the
[1:16:17] same person."
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Is that right? God bringing that to a
[1:16:22] reality and a rest in this hour. And
[1:16:24] John, think of this. Let me remind you
[1:16:27] who this is. Let me remind you who's
[1:16:29] writing here. You say, "Brother Samuel,
[1:16:32] it's the Holy Spirit." I agree with you.
[1:16:34] But it's the Holy Spirit that has
[1:16:36] control over a man who wanted to call
[1:16:38] fire down out of heaven.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; That's how he was. Are you hearing me?
[1:16:45] That's how he was.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; Things weren't going his way. Fire
[1:16:50] coming down on heaven. He wanted to use
[1:16:52] that from what Elijah did. Remember
[1:16:55] Jesus set his face and was not going to
[1:16:57] turn in and they weren't going to
[1:16:58] receive him. And John, the first thing
[1:17:00] he does is, "Shall we call fire down out
[1:17:03] of heaven?" And what did Jesus say? He
[1:17:05] said, "You know not what spirit you are
[1:17:08] of."
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; I tell you friends, this is always a
[1:17:12] place of discernment. Because the spirit
[1:17:15] of God is not about zapping and
[1:17:17] dissolving. A spirit of God is always
[1:17:20] that which is in tune to the word and
[1:17:23] not getting sidetracked. Right.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; Things come and go. Differences.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; Differences come and go. Is that right?
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; I don't believe we bury them in the
[1:17:35] backyard. I believe I believe it's dealt
[1:17:36] with by the grace of almighty God. I
[1:17:39] believe the blood of Jesus Christ is to
[1:17:41] deal with these things. Do you believe
[1:17:43] that?
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:46] Glory be to God. I think you know I I I
[1:17:49] think it's time. Stop carrying things
[1:17:51] that you've carried for all these years.
[1:17:54] I mean, you ain't going to get no medal
[1:17:55] at the end of the day.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, you carried a grudge longer than
[1:17:59] this one.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; You carrying an offense longer than this
[1:18:02] one.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; You ain't going to get no you ain't
[1:18:04] going to get no medal at the end of the
[1:18:05] day.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; But it's right now is the opportunity.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; Let me just tell you what'll happen. You
[1:18:11] won't get a medal. But the Bible says
[1:18:13] every one of us must appear at the
[1:18:15] judgment seat of Christ and will have to
[1:18:17] give an answer. Why did you hold on to
[1:18:20] that grudge and hinder
[1:18:24] Why was you always making trouble? Why
[1:18:27] was that? And you'll have to give an
[1:18:28] account for that. Now, I'm not going to
[1:18:30] say a person is lost. I'm talking about
[1:18:31] the judgment seat of Christ, not the
[1:18:33] white throne judgment.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? You know, I I I
[1:18:38] don't want to be there as you know, you
[1:18:39] were always a problem. You were always a
[1:18:41] troublemaker. You were all all you did
[1:18:42] was hold offenses. All you did was hold
[1:18:44] grudges. This is how you're known. I
[1:18:46] don't want to be there standing in that
[1:18:48] way
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; because I believe in the achievement of
[1:18:54] the love of God and what it produces
[1:18:56] through our lives.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; You see, God allows situations. As I
[1:19:01] said earlier, he allows things to come
[1:19:03] our way.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; You know why? He does it to prove his
[1:19:07] love through our lives.
[1:19:10] So, you mean God has not called me to
[1:19:12] straighten everybody else out? Dear
[1:19:14] Lord, if everybody could just think like
[1:19:16] me,
[1:19:18] thank God we don't.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; Thank God you don't think all like me.
[1:19:22] Thank God.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, I know if you think your
[1:19:26] thoughts are absolute, I mean, but I'm
[1:19:28] just saying I thank God. I I thank God.
[1:19:30] God has made it in such a way that the
[1:19:33] love of God prevails in our lives.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know what? Let me tell
[1:19:38] you what's more supernatural. It's more
[1:19:40] supernatural to lay aside an offense
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; than it is for healing to follow.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; It's more supernatural to lay aside a
[1:19:49] grudge than it is to walk on water.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; Because walking on water, listen, that
[1:19:55] may be a wonderful thing. You might be
[1:19:57] edified and everything else, but to lay
[1:19:58] aside a grudge is to allow the Holy
[1:20:01] Spirit to clear and make a pathway for
[1:20:04] himself to be expressed through your
[1:20:06] life.
[1:20:08] And God's not going to send the prophet
[1:20:10] again. The prophet is here, the Holy
[1:20:12] Spirit, the spirit of truth, a discerner
[1:20:15] of the thoughts and intents of the
[1:20:16] heart.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; So good.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; So the emphasis, you know, anytime you
[1:20:23] have an emphasis,
[1:20:26] emphasis on something, and an emphasis
[1:20:28] is a special importance or value,
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; right? It's kind of, you know, it's just
[1:20:33] like a doctrine or it'll lay on a
[1:20:36] certain e emphasis and people become
[1:20:39] known by that doctrine. Whatever the,
[1:20:42] you know, the the terminology is and
[1:20:44] everything else that goes with it become
[1:20:46] they become known by that. It becomes a
[1:20:48] point of emphasis
[1:20:51] and and and so it it begin what does it
[1:20:53] do? It begins to make a name. A name is
[1:20:57] a character,
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; right? that you become associated with
[1:21:00] this group or this thing or this move.
[1:21:03] You have this expression. Why it becomes
[1:21:06] and many times sometimes people here
[1:21:08] they're going many times they're going
[1:21:10] right along with it. Don't even know
[1:21:11] what's going on. You know what? Why are
[1:21:12] you doing this? Cuz everybody else is
[1:21:14] doing it.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; Everybody else is believing it.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; That's called herd mentality.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; That's what that's called.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Doing something because somebody else is
[1:21:25] doing it and you just think it's the
[1:21:26] right thing to do.
[1:21:29] The Bible said, "Let all things be
[1:21:32] proven."
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; Is that right? And hold fast to that
[1:21:36] which is good.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. Woo.
[1:21:42] So, an emphasis. Listen. Watch how
[1:21:44] Brother Ram says, the world's dying for
[1:21:46] love. That's the fountain that God's got
[1:21:49] open. You said I want to ask you the
[1:21:51] greatest of all the gifts that's in the
[1:21:52] local body and we put so much emphasis
[1:21:56] on speaking with tongues interpretations
[1:21:58] first is wisdom and brother Ram goes
[1:22:00] right on down within that part and he
[1:22:02] says but then after that is if you don't
[1:22:04] have wisdom how can you operate your
[1:22:05] knowledge he said and he says if you
[1:22:07] haven't got knowledge you won't know how
[1:22:09] to have peace I think we found an answer
[1:22:14] for a lack of knowledge my people perish
[1:22:19] Notice he says you've got to put first
[1:22:22] things first, not on evidences, upon the
[1:22:26] spirit, God.
[1:22:29] It's incredible. Here it is. I'm reading
[1:22:31] 1957. This is Saskatoon. Brother
[1:22:33] Brandham says the same things in his own
[1:22:35] church. And in 1965, Satan's Eden.
[1:22:38] You've heard me refer to this
[1:22:41] hundreds of times where brother Brandham
[1:22:44] says, "I heard it's been said around
[1:22:46] here. Why don't brother Brandham preach
[1:22:48] on the Holy Ghost?"
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; And I've also said this multiple times.
[1:22:53] Find me a tape. Find me a message that
[1:22:56] he don't preach on the Holy Ghost.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; Find me a message.
[1:23:02] But even in his own church right there
[1:23:04] in Brandham Tabernacle, why are people
[1:23:07] asking that? Because they're still
[1:23:10] looking
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; back to a different light
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; and they still have not been delivered
[1:23:17] or come fully into that place. Remember
[1:23:20] Malachi 4, birth pains. The church is to
[1:23:23] be delivered of a new birth.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; It's not taking Ladyosa Pentecost even
[1:23:29] though we're in the Ladyian age. It's
[1:23:31] not taking Pentecostalism and putting it
[1:23:34] in the vat and mixing the message up
[1:23:36] with it. No sir, it the Bible is clear.
[1:23:39] The message is clear. Burn that old
[1:23:42] leaven with fire.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; The shuck is not what we want. The seed
[1:23:49] passed through the shuck.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; So in other words, we don't have to have
[1:23:54] shucks and shucks and shucks and shucks
[1:23:56] and shucks. Shucks. Did you have
[1:23:58] service? Shucks. No. Shucks. Shucks.
[1:24:00] shuts. Everything is on shuts. Oh,
[1:24:03] brother Sam, you're taken away from the
[1:24:05] moving of the spirit. I am not. But
[1:24:08] Pentecost, remember, it was the
[1:24:10] restoration of the gifts, but it was not
[1:24:14] the restoration that was promised.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; The restoration that was promised is
[1:24:20] that the seed would come forth in its
[1:24:23] full original power and glory that could
[1:24:27] take all the word.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:29] Pentecost couldn't take all the word.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; Pentecost couldn't take setting the
[1:24:33] gifts in order.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; They couldn't take any of that at all.
[1:24:36] It was just whatever I feel led to do
[1:24:38] and I feel led to do this and I feel led
[1:24:40] and I feel led and I feel led and boy
[1:24:42] however I feel led to do and I feel led
[1:24:43] and I everything becomes
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; and you look and think well all of the
[1:24:49] feelings and leadings surely
[1:24:52] the Holy Spirit won't lead you outside
[1:24:54] of his word. Right.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; Well, I just felt led at that moment to
[1:24:59] speak in tongues. Surely, surely he's
[1:25:02] not going to lead you in a moment to
[1:25:05] overstep the boundaries of his word he's
[1:25:07] given.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; Because if he'll do that for that, where
[1:25:12] does it stop?
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; What other word will he break?
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; But he don't break his word. He's a
[1:25:20] spirit of truth. His word never fails.
[1:25:23] He's God. And you know our confidence is
[1:25:25] he'll always come according to his word.
[1:25:27] That's why you can be sitting right here
[1:25:29] tonight and have a need in your body and
[1:25:31] you don't have a direct word. You don't
[1:25:33] even have a feeling. But there is a a
[1:25:35] resolve in his word that it says that by
[1:25:38] his stripes I am healed. I'm the Lord
[1:25:40] that health thy diseases. And you can
[1:25:42] rest your faith right there and with
[1:25:45] patience wait for it to come to pass.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Well, brother Samuel, they
[1:25:53] might step from this dimension in the
[1:25:55] next dimension, it's healing.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; Whether it's the lion, the ox, the man,
[1:26:01] or the eagle, it's all healing.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; Am I right?
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's standing on God's word.
[1:26:09] That's why the prophet said, "If I was
[1:26:11] standing here, greatest bountif,000
[1:26:14] and every one of them died," he said,
[1:26:15] "I'd be back on the platform the next
[1:26:17] night."
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; What are you talking about? What,
[1:26:21] brother Samuel? What is that all about?
[1:26:23] That's about faith in God's word.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet, let me finish
[1:26:27] the quote out of Satan's Eden. He said,
[1:26:29] "Don't," he said, "what it is the Holy
[1:26:32] Ghost is the person of Christ in you
[1:26:35] quickened, made alive to every word for
[1:26:38] this age." He said, "Don't watch it so
[1:26:41] much in demonstrations, but watch it in
[1:26:44] action."
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Cuz you know why demonstrations can be
[1:26:48] just a moment?
[1:26:51] just a moment. That's why Paul said,
[1:26:52] "Though I have faith to move mountains,
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; though I can speak with tongues, though
[1:26:57] I can have demonstration,
[1:26:59] but it's the action."
[1:27:01] Are you hearing me? It's the action.
[1:27:03] It's when everything is going wrong.
[1:27:05] It's your action.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; It's when everything you feel on the
[1:27:08] mountain, it's your action. You see,
[1:27:10] it's not you acting, it's the Holy Ghost
[1:27:12] acting through you.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; That's the action of the word. Oh my
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; friends, I rejoice in this.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; Don't you?
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; I rejoice. It's a settling in God's
[1:27:24] word.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; God's brought us to a place to where
[1:27:27] we're not chasing evidences and
[1:27:30] demonstrations. That's no sign. But the
[1:27:33] only sign it is is genuine faith in
[1:27:37] God's word where our lives have been
[1:27:39] changed and our desires match God's
[1:27:42] word.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:46] Notice the prophet said as he's dealing
[1:27:49] with this. He said, 'You know, we we put
[1:27:50] so much emphasis on these things, upon
[1:27:53] great healing, revivals, and miracles
[1:27:55] being worked. He wasn't against them.
[1:27:57] He's talking about we put too much
[1:27:59] emphasis on them.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; He said, "But many will come to me in
[1:28:02] that day and say, Lord, have I not cast
[1:28:04] out devils in your name? Have I not done
[1:28:05] many mighty works?" And I'll say unto
[1:28:07] them, "Depart from me, you workers of
[1:28:09] iniquity. I did not even know you."
[1:28:14] They were used to preach.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; They had many mighty signs and wonders.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; And like the prophet tells us in the
[1:28:24] church age book, he said, when you go to
[1:28:26] start pinning them on the word, they'll
[1:28:28] always fall back to the same argument.
[1:28:30] We get results, don't we?
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:37] So, notice he said, "What a
[1:28:39] disappointment that will be."
[1:28:41] I don't know about you, but I don't want
[1:28:42] nobody to miss it.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; I don't want nobody to miss it.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; If you do, you need to you need to you
[1:28:49] need to say, "Lord, let my heart be
[1:28:50] right."
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I don't want nobody to miss
[1:28:55] it. This is why God sent his word. This
[1:28:57] is why the ministering of the word is so
[1:28:59] what? We don't want to miss it. Listen,
[1:29:01] the rapture is not a haphazard affair.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; Like, well, you know, I'm around the
[1:29:06] message, so you know, I just it's just
[1:29:08] going to happen to me. It ain't a
[1:29:09] half-hazard affair. the rapture. The
[1:29:11] prophet said he's coming for those who
[1:29:13] not not believe in his coming but are
[1:29:16] living for his coming.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; Because if we really believe it, we live
[1:29:20] for it.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:24] He says, "Now notice love, God's love,
[1:29:27] it'll take the place of speaking in
[1:29:30] tongues, and that's all right. It'll
[1:29:32] take the place of gifts and wonders and
[1:29:34] signs and everything else." I know you
[1:29:37] you get into dealing with saying this
[1:29:39] quote and then you you get what it is.
[1:29:40] You get complexes that come out firing
[1:29:44] long list of quotes and things and well
[1:29:47] never done away with the gifts. Brother
[1:29:48] Bram wasn't even saying that right here.
[1:29:50] He's talking about what comes back to
[1:29:53] the real important thing. You know
[1:29:57] friends, that's why you know what that's
[1:29:58] why I believe just preach the message.
[1:30:00] It don't need to be manhandled.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; Preach it. God will vindicate it. God
[1:30:06] will see this word gets to where it
[1:30:08] needs to be. He don't need my help. He
[1:30:10] don't need your Si. He only needs our
[1:30:13] womb to receive it and believe it.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; Listen, God has the anointed cherubams
[1:30:21] watching over his word. And when the
[1:30:24] spirit of God has come into our life, we
[1:30:26] are anointed right there with those
[1:30:29] cherubams. And our life is not facing
[1:30:31] away from the word. Our life is facing
[1:30:34] with the word. And no matter where the
[1:30:37] spirit of God moves, it moves us
[1:30:40] forward.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; So if there's something that's moving us
[1:30:45] backward, that ain't the spirit of God.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; It might be fear coming along. Oh, I
[1:30:51] fear I fear we left this or I I'm afraid
[1:30:53] we need this. I'm We don't need anything
[1:30:55] to prop the word up.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; We don't need anything to make the word
[1:30:59] more powerful than what it already is.
[1:31:01] Amen.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? That's why brother
[1:31:03] Brandon when he made the statement in
[1:31:04] the Pergamian age, he said, "I wonder if
[1:31:06] we are sufficiently impressed with the
[1:31:08] word in our midst."
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; Are we impressed enough with it? Or do
[1:31:12] we have to try to bring other things
[1:31:14] into it and build other things around
[1:31:16] it? Yeah. Yeah. It's the word, but but
[1:31:18] but no, it's not but but but it's the
[1:31:20] word himself that's among us.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; The living word. I'm not talking about a
[1:31:26] letter. I'm talking about the living
[1:31:28] Lord Jesus Christ. the promise that he
[1:31:31] made. That's what the message of the
[1:31:33] hour is. It's the promise that God made
[1:31:37] for this hour.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; Notice he says, "If you haven't got love
[1:31:45] to accompany that, what good does the
[1:31:48] signs do you?"
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; Right? You haven't got love. Like
[1:31:54] brother talked about that Pentecostal
[1:31:56] kitten, keep petting it this way,
[1:31:58] everything's all right.
[1:32:02] It'll just move. Oh. Oh, it just moves
[1:32:04] so good. Rub it the wrong rub it the
[1:32:06] other way.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; Where'd that come from? It was there the
[1:32:12] whole time.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; It was there the whole time. You see,
[1:32:15] divine love is what's got to accompany
[1:32:17] these gifts.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; Because why? The gifts must be
[1:32:21] submissive to the word.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; That's what makes it submissive. If it's
[1:32:26] not divine love, it will become selfish.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; It will become about self.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; And that's where brother Bram says,
[1:32:38] don't pull your gift away from the body.
[1:32:41] Let it blend
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; with the body.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, let it blend. I'll let it be put it
[1:32:47] right up here in the corner. I want my
[1:32:48] gift. No, no. God wants it to blend.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; He wants it to blend.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; He wants it to blend. How many of you
[1:32:55] that's what I want to do? I want to
[1:32:56] blend.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Notice notice it'll take the
[1:33:02] place. He didn't say it would do away
[1:33:03] with tongues. It'll take the place.
[1:33:06] It'll be the love of God setting down.
[1:33:08] And the love of God is what is in
[1:33:10] supreme control.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; If you haven't gotten love to accompany
[1:33:14] that, what good does the signs do? God's
[1:33:17] tried to do it across the nations, but
[1:33:18] it wouldn't work. the greatest of all of
[1:33:21] the gifts. He talks about the greatest
[1:33:23] of all the gifts that you know he says
[1:33:25] that there is is wisdom. The second is
[1:33:27] knowledge. If you haven't got knowledge,
[1:33:28] you haven't got wisdom. And how can you
[1:33:31] control your knowledge?
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; Remember brother Ram talks about I think
[1:33:34] it was Morris Ungram. I think that's the
[1:33:37] right name. You know that or I I know
[1:33:40] where the message is at. Remember
[1:33:41] brother Bram talks about he said when he
[1:33:43] closed that door they were sitting in
[1:33:44] that hall and brother Bram talks about
[1:33:46] how they closed that door and those men
[1:33:48] the way they were doing with the trinity
[1:33:49] and everything else not up in Chicago
[1:33:51] but in another place he closed that door
[1:33:53] and he started in on them men he said
[1:33:55] you bunch of ignorammes
[1:33:59] said you know he had a lot of knowledge
[1:34:01] he said but if he only tempered a little
[1:34:02] that with a little bit of love
[1:34:05] he said he called them everything you
[1:34:07] know just ignoramises and everything
[1:34:09] else but if he would have just tempered
[1:34:10] it with a little bit of love. Now
[1:34:13] notice, hallelujah, seek the first
[1:34:16] things first. We've gone after gifts.
[1:34:20] We've gone after this. We've gone after
[1:34:22] that because the supernatural was done.
[1:34:27] But brother, don't seek gifts. Seek
[1:34:29] don't seek favor with the denomination.
[1:34:31] And let me just tell you something. You
[1:34:32] might think we're beyond denominations.
[1:34:35] Yep. God has brought us out. But
[1:34:36] denominations is not a brickandmortar
[1:34:39] building.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; It's a spirit.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; It's a spirit of exclusivity.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; If you're in our fellowship, if you
[1:34:47] believe like we believe, if you have in
[1:34:49] the ministry that we have in, if you do
[1:34:52] this and you do this, let me just say
[1:34:53] this to you. If I was invited to preach
[1:34:56] in a return ministry church and I felt
[1:34:59] led of the Lord to go, I would go there
[1:35:01] and try to be a help to those people.
[1:35:03] And let me tell you, I would not blast
[1:35:05] return ministry.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; If I was invited to go and preach, I
[1:35:11] don't even know if there's I think
[1:35:12] there's a few Seven Thunder churches
[1:35:14] maybe left and other things like that.
[1:35:16] But it it and I'm not against going
[1:35:18] because you say, "Well, you know why?
[1:35:20] Because there's some of God's sheep."
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; There's some of God's sheep. It might be
[1:35:25] off here or off there. Listen, friends,
[1:35:27] there's got to be a place of certainty.
[1:35:29] I'm not up here wondering am am am am am
[1:35:31] am am am am am am am am am am am am am
[1:35:31] am am am am am am am am am am am am am
[1:35:31] am am am am am am am am am am am I
[1:35:32] standing on the right grounds." I mean
[1:35:33] you you can't have that as a pastor. You
[1:35:35] can't even have it in your own homes.
[1:35:37] Well, I don't know if I'm right. Maybe
[1:35:38] I'm wrong. Maybe I'm right. Maybe. You
[1:35:39] can't have that. It's got to be a
[1:35:41] certainty. But that certainty can't be a
[1:35:43] man-made certainty. It's got to be a
[1:35:45] certainty that goes beyond the reasoning
[1:35:48] of that man and beyond your reasoning
[1:35:50] because God will say things and do
[1:35:52] things that many times is not even
[1:35:54] reasonable.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:59] Tell me opening a sea is reasonable.
[1:36:02] Tell me. Tell me taking down walls and
[1:36:05] leaving one part up with with a little
[1:36:07] harlot on it. Tell me that's reasonable.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; Tell me the last time you ever seen that
[1:36:12] done. Tell me the last time when a river
[1:36:14] is flooded its banks that it was ever
[1:36:16] parted.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; Tell me that that's reasonable to cross
[1:36:20] it at the most flooded time.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; But God has a way
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; of doing things that's unreasonable.
[1:36:28] You know why? Because sometimes, not
[1:36:31] intentionally, we can get to leaning
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; to our own understanding.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; And God has a way of so working to draw
[1:36:38] us away
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; from our own understanding.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; You know what does that love?
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; Not what he demands.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; His love.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; My lord. My lord. So here we have notice
[1:36:54] brother Brandon says we've gone after
[1:36:55] gifts because the supernatural done. But
[1:36:57] brother, don't seek gifts. Don't seek
[1:36:59] favor with the denomination. Seek the
[1:37:01] love of God.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; So it's not about trying to get in with
[1:37:04] a group and him with a special
[1:37:05] fellowship. Oh, if I can get in with
[1:37:07] this or if I can get in with that, the
[1:37:09] only thing I'm interested in getting in,
[1:37:10] I'm interested in getting in more with
[1:37:12] him.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; That that's what I want to do because
[1:37:15] everybody that the the desire that I
[1:37:17] have, if everybody else has that desire
[1:37:19] and getting in with him, my goodness,
[1:37:20] we'll have a good old time. But you see,
[1:37:22] sometimes individuals can compromise on
[1:37:25] things to get into certain fellowships.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; They want to preach in certain areas.
[1:37:29] They want to do certain things. And so
[1:37:31] there's certain little things that they
[1:37:33] value. And maybe God doesn't even want
[1:37:36] them or to use their gift even in around
[1:37:38] in that place. God uses his gifts as he
[1:37:43] sees fit
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; and to whatever frequency
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; he wants to use them.
[1:37:50] God can use a man and all of a sudden
[1:37:52] that frequency is over.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; It's done. God's used God's God's worked
[1:37:57] through that that gift and that office
[1:37:58] into that place to where it's come to
[1:38:01] that place that it's enough.
[1:38:04] The right emphasis.
[1:38:07] So let's look here at the right emphasis
[1:38:08] here just just a moment. Let me let me
[1:38:11] guess. Let let me just try to close on
[1:38:12] this here on the right emphasis because
[1:38:15] there's a lot of emphasis and sometimes
[1:38:17] emphasis
[1:38:20] is the way things are said sometimes.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; Sometimes the way things are said such
[1:38:27] as getting done with a service,
[1:38:30] preaching has gone forth and now here
[1:38:32] will come an individual and my now we
[1:38:37] want to we want to be careful. We want
[1:38:38] to be still. We want to see if God will
[1:38:41] say something. Hadn't he been saying
[1:38:43] something?
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; You see, one little thing like that has
[1:38:48] become a point of emphasis.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; And without it being said, if if it was
[1:38:52] down, say, "Wait a minute. Are are you
[1:38:54] are you saying and placing a gift? If if
[1:38:56] it's a discernment, a gift of prophecy,
[1:38:58] by the way, it's got to be tried by two
[1:39:01] or three.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; I don't care if the man's had 10 out of
[1:39:05] 10. If this is 10, if this is number 11,
[1:39:08] it's to be tried.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; Don't matter who it is. Don't matter
[1:39:14] what's been happened, it's to be tried.
[1:39:15] I'm not saying that to be indifferent.
[1:39:17] I'm saying that because that's the word.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; And it's also the very thing that
[1:39:21] brother Brandham went to brother Neville
[1:39:22] about under the direction of the spirit
[1:39:24] of God because people were going and
[1:39:26] always wanting to pull something out of
[1:39:28] brother Neville. Pull something out of
[1:39:30] brother Neville.
[1:39:36] You think friends sometimes the wrong
[1:39:39] emphasis can get placed
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; and people are chasing after this
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; this man to pray after me. This one let
[1:39:47] me tell you sister you may not be able
[1:39:50] to get where anybody is but God's called
[1:39:53] you to pray for your children
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; to pray for your needs
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; and you are thought of just as much in
[1:39:59] the economy of God. Brother Brandham
[1:40:00] would spin countless quotes over and
[1:40:03] over so that the people didn't look when
[1:40:05] a service or a great meeting was over as
[1:40:08] though it's all over. Brother Brandham
[1:40:10] said you're a pastor. These other
[1:40:12] ministers, he said, "You as a daughter
[1:40:15] of God or a son of God." You know why?
[1:40:17] This message was not about highlighting
[1:40:20] a personality.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; It was to lift up the name of Jesus
[1:40:24] Christ. Not any other name, not any
[1:40:27] other church. It's to lift up Jesus
[1:40:30] Christ.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; That's a love of God.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; That's the right emphasis is Christ.
[1:40:37] Remember, Brother Brandon talks about
[1:40:38] voice of healing. He said, "I've got a
[1:40:40] problem with voice of healing." That was
[1:40:41] originally Brother Brham's magazine. You
[1:40:43] know,
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham was deceived into
[1:40:46] turning over. Oh, that may bother you,
[1:40:49] but it's true. He was deceived in
[1:40:50] turning over. He even knew, when I say
[1:40:52] deceived, he really wasn't deceived, but
[1:40:54] what it was, he knew what was coming.
[1:40:55] that a man was coming to present for him
[1:40:57] to sign over his tent in that magazine.
[1:40:59] And that man was supposed to be his
[1:41:01] friend.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; And brother Bram went ahead and signed
[1:41:04] it over. Look how brother Ram this this
[1:41:06] You understand what I'm saying? I look
[1:41:07] at the quality.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; I look at the quality of the spirit. He
[1:41:10] could have got up and exposed that man.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; Told that these papers were about
[1:41:17] something else other than what they were
[1:41:19] about. But look at it.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; If your enemy takes your coat,
[1:41:26] Give him a cloak also. Couldn't
[1:41:27] remember. I was going to say hat.
[1:41:31] And don't give him the kind. Don't give
[1:41:32] him the one you going to give to
[1:41:33] Goodwill. Give him the one that
[1:41:40] Brother Brand was brother Brandon
[1:41:41] magazine. You see, Brother Brham didn't
[1:41:42] get up and say, "Uhuh,
[1:41:45] now the Lord showed me that you were
[1:41:47] coming in here and and this is what you
[1:41:49] were going to do and and this is He
[1:41:51] could have.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; He knew it,
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:41:54] They thought they were deceiving him. He
[1:41:56] knew it,
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; Let me get back to my point. The Voice
[1:42:01] of Healing magazine, he said, "You know
[1:42:02] what the problem is?" He said,
[1:42:03] "Everything he said in their magazine,
[1:42:05] he said, they keep on writing about and
[1:42:08] this man prayed for this such and such
[1:42:09] and this and this man prayed for this
[1:42:11] and this and this and this happened and
[1:42:13] and you know what some of the miracles
[1:42:14] they were writing about? They were
[1:42:15] writing about Brother Brandom." But
[1:42:16] brother Brandham, he took issue with it.
[1:42:19] He said, "The problem is they're lifting
[1:42:21] up too many other names." He said,
[1:42:23] "There's only one name that's the
[1:42:25] biggest name, the greatest name. That's
[1:42:27] the name of Jesus Christ."
[1:42:30] That's the heart of this message. This
[1:42:33] message never came to put emphasis on a
[1:42:37] city, on a church, on a personality.
[1:42:40] This message is the lifting up of the
[1:42:44] Lord Jesus
[1:42:46] Christ.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:52] Andraise.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; You think the love of God ain't
[1:42:56] powerful?
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; Look what the love of God did when it
[1:42:59] took a little old Kentucky man didn't
[1:43:03] even have a seventh grade education.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; A man that had complexes probably that
[1:43:08] this building wouldn't even be able to
[1:43:10] hold. When he would walk down one side
[1:43:12] of the street, people would walk on the
[1:43:14] other side. Didn't want nothing to do
[1:43:16] with him. You think there wasn't a
[1:43:18] testing and an overcoming in his own
[1:43:20] life, but you watch how the spirit of
[1:43:22] God overcame even the temptations to put
[1:43:26] forth William Brandham that Jesus Christ
[1:43:29] might be put before the people. I don't
[1:43:31] know about you, but I look at that right
[1:43:33] there and I see the victory of Calvary
[1:43:37] not just in William Brandham. I see the
[1:43:39] victory of Calvary through you and I.
[1:43:42] Above every complex, above every family
[1:43:45] strain, above every hurt, above things
[1:43:48] that's took place, I see the prevailing
[1:43:50] power of the love of God and what it
[1:43:52] will do.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; To where his resolve was, there's no one
[1:44:02] ever cared for me like Jesus.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; There's no greater friend. Amen.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; Then he
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; and he operated
[1:44:12] from that reality
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; And that's what was brought to you and I
[1:44:18] this message
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; of divine love
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; which love is what produces
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; faith.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; And faith gives us a confidence
[1:44:32] in every situation
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; that he loves me.
[1:44:37] and I love him.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; And that masters the circumstance.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; You love him tonight.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; Lord willing, we'll pick up here again
[1:44:49] on the right emphasis.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; Thank God for his mercy.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; Thank God for his mercy.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; Thank God for the love of God.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see friends, this is where it
[1:45:01] all comes in. To be based from
[1:45:02] everything in our life is to know that
[1:45:05] we've passed from death unto life.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; To know what we was and what we are now.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; It wasn't you or me that came looking
[1:45:15] for God.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; No. Amen.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; So, brother Sam, I had a desire, but
[1:45:18] that desire wasn't your desire.
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; That was God's desire.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; That was God's desire working in your
[1:45:26] life. And as a matter of fact, the
[1:45:27] prophet said you as the spirit of God
[1:45:30] would begin to move upon that word in
[1:45:31] the fulfillment. He said that is what is
[1:45:33] making the pool upon your life in this
[1:45:35] hour. It's the spirit of God that's
[1:45:38] pulling us, drawing us into perfect
[1:45:40] obedience. It wasn't you seeking God
[1:45:42] out. God sought you out.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; God sought you out, not you seeking God
[1:45:48] out.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:51] Oh my. Can I read this quote to you? I
[1:45:53] know I said I was going to I was going
[1:45:54] to close. Let me just read this to you.
[1:45:56] Let me let me read just a little part of
[1:45:57] it. I I promise I won't read it all.
[1:45:59] I'll try not to. He said, 'When we were
[1:46:02] sinners, I wanted to read scriptures,
[1:46:03] but I I want to read this here. When we
[1:46:05] were sinners, alienated without God in
[1:46:09] the world in that muck of mud, as I
[1:46:11] talked this morning, God come to us.
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; God sought you. You never sought God.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; No man can come to me except the father
[1:46:23] draws him first.
[1:46:26] You
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; understand it wasn't you. It's not your
[1:46:28] desire. It's not even what you wanted.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; It's God's desire.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; Direct quote, great warrior David. He
[1:46:37] said it wasn't your desire that you're a
[1:46:39] Christian this morning. You are a
[1:46:41] Christian by God's desire.
[1:46:45] [Applause]
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; So, I'm not going in a rapture by my
[1:46:50] desire, even though I desire that. I'm
[1:46:53] going in a rapture by God's desire.
[1:46:57] It's God seeing to it. It's God bringing
[1:47:00] correction in my life. It's God giving
[1:47:02] me the grace that I need right now. Cuz
[1:47:04] it's God's desire, not my achievement.
[1:47:08] The rapture is not your achievement.
[1:47:11] It's not a church's achievement. It's
[1:47:13] not a prophet's achievement. The the
[1:47:16] rapture is the achievement. For he said,
[1:47:18] "I will present to myself
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; a glorious church
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; without spot, wrinkle, blemish, or any
[1:47:29] such thing."
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; Won't be any denies. Didn't I, Lord?
[1:47:38] Didn't I? Didn't I? Didn't I deny?
[1:47:42] Didn't I? Didn't I? Didn't I?
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; Nope. Won't be in that.
[1:47:48] Didn't you, Lord?
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; Lord, when I felt like giving up,
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; didn't you come, Lord?
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; When I felt like, Lord, I was nothing,
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; didn't you? Pour out your sanctifying
[1:48:02] love.
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; Lord, when thoughts were overwhelming
[1:48:06] me, didn't you?
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; Didn't you, Lord?
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:13] Maybe we're standing there and in that
[1:48:14] and just pouring out praises before his
[1:48:16] throne. Somebody else say, "Hey, wait,
[1:48:18] wait, wait, wait. I I I got some praise
[1:48:20] to pour out here,
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; Lord. When I was lost, didn't you found
[1:48:24] me?"
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; Lord, when I felt like nobody didn't
[1:48:29] love me, but didn't you, Lord?
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; Didn't you, Lord? Didn't you, Lord? When
[1:48:34] I felt like I couldn't make another
[1:48:35] step, didn't you, Lord?
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother. You're talking about the
[1:48:41] praises and the anthems ring.
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; No wonder David said in the Psalms, "He
[1:48:47] hath created Zion to praise."
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; Our lives are a praise. He has built up
[1:48:54] our walls.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Stone upon stone, word on
[1:48:58] top of word, life on top of word. He has
[1:49:01] built him, his body, his dwelling place.
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; That we would show forth the praises.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand.
[1:49:13] Brother says, "Look at this. God came
[1:49:16] down in that muck.
[1:49:19] In that muck, he became one of us.
[1:49:23] Body of humiliation.
[1:49:27] Let me bring it on down. He came right
[1:49:29] down in the muck we were in."
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, he did.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; He came right down right to where we
[1:49:37] were.
[1:49:38] cuz he knows we surely didn't have the
[1:49:40] confidence to even lift up our head.
[1:49:44] But God came right to where we were. I
[1:49:46] don't know what pig pin you were in. Oh,
[1:49:49] you could be sitting right in the
[1:49:50] message church. And the message church
[1:49:51] is not a pig pin, but we could be living
[1:49:53] in a pig pin in our lives,
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; but the spirit of God will come right
[1:49:58] down right where we're at. And you know
[1:50:00] what he begins to do? He begins to make
[1:50:02] known his love to us of what he did for
[1:50:06] you and I. You know the one thing that's
[1:50:08] so powerful about the love of God, the
[1:50:10] love of God when it's projected, it does
[1:50:14] not project to us that it that he felios
[1:50:19] our condition or he likes the things
[1:50:22] that are being manifested. No, no. But
[1:50:25] the agape love looks beyond all of that.
[1:50:28] And that's the real love of God. Right?
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; That's how God tells us to love agape
[1:50:34] one another.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; And if we're agape, if we're under that
[1:50:38] direction of agape love, then the spirit
[1:50:40] of God can direct our felio love in the
[1:50:44] right way.
[1:50:48] Man, I if I get going on this, we'll
[1:50:50] just have to sit back down.
[1:50:55] That ought to create a perfect love.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Look what you was and look what
[1:51:02] you are.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes we spade too long on
[1:51:05] that comma.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; Look what you was.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; A comma means a brief pause for you to
[1:51:11] turn around
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; and look what you was.
[1:51:15] Not looking back. Oh, I was this. I tell
[1:51:17] you, I don't know. Oh, man. Yeah. And
[1:51:19] the devil. Yeah. Look, you've done so
[1:51:20] much. You've done too much. You did
[1:51:22] this. You did. No. No. But then by
[1:51:24] pausing, the whole thing is is to look
[1:51:26] what you are now.
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; You didn't do this.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; This is not a church life.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; A church life is like good homemade
[1:51:36] icing on store-bought cake.
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; But it's got to be something that starts
[1:51:43] on the inside. You know what? Anytime
[1:51:46] I've watched I I've watched my my my
[1:51:49] sister-in-law Mina. I've watched her
[1:51:51] amazing making cakes. I mean, she could
[1:51:53] just she she could put them all out of
[1:51:55] business with the cakes she makes. and
[1:51:57] so so meticulous that that gift fell
[1:51:59] straight from Sister Mary and just
[1:52:00] working with all those things and such
[1:52:02] intricate. She had a cake that looked
[1:52:03] just like a basket. It looked like too
[1:52:05] good to eat.
[1:52:08] But she knows I love that buttercream
[1:52:10] icing that's made on that cake. But you
[1:52:13] know when she would make the cakes I
[1:52:14] would go in there when I'd be down there
[1:52:16] and you know what you make the cake
[1:52:18] first.
[1:52:19] Them cakes are sitting out and cooling.
[1:52:22] All you can think about is once they get
[1:52:24] icing on them. Now, I know some people
[1:52:25] don't like icing. I'll pray for you. But
[1:52:27] you know what? A cake for me, it's got
[1:52:30] to have some icing on it.
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; It's like trying to eat pancakes without
[1:52:33] syrup.
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; Once again, is that any spiritual thing?
[1:52:38] No. Can we differ on that? Yeah. You
[1:52:40] might baptize yours and someone may not.
[1:52:42] That's kind of like someone liking this
[1:52:43] kind of music and someone not liking
[1:52:45] this kind. It's preferences.
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Right?
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; But you see, you you got to let that
[1:52:52] stuff you got you got to let it come
[1:52:53] around and then eventually they'll make
[1:52:54] the icing. And see, that's how the
[1:52:56] spirit of God works in our life. Divine
[1:52:58] love works from the inside
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; out.
[1:53:02] This is why it's not something we take
[1:53:05] and smear on on the outside. Well, I got
[1:53:07] to have more patience and and we're
[1:53:09] smearing it on on the outside.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; Ain't going to work.
[1:53:13] It
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; ain't going to work. You can have divine
[1:53:15] love even in your soul, which is where
[1:53:16] it has to be. That's
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; right. It has to be there
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; for the rapture. That's the seal of the
[1:53:22] living God.
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; But but even when God begins to deal
[1:53:25] with our lives and we realize we need
[1:53:26] more patience, what it is is God's
[1:53:28] calling us to come deeper in fellowship
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; with him.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; See, putting on that garment, sinking
[1:53:36] into it so that it's him that's more
[1:53:38] visible. It's not your patience. It's
[1:53:41] not my patience.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; It's God's patience. That's where the
[1:53:44] scripture said, adding increasing
[1:53:47] patience, increasing virtue in our
[1:53:50] lives.
[1:53:52] Look what you was and look what you are.
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; What did that? Somebody that loves you.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; I wish I had the strength to put the
[1:54:03] emphasis the prophet did right there
[1:54:04] with that exclamation point. What did
[1:54:06] that? Somebody that loves you. Oh, you
[1:54:08] mean it wasn't me. It wasn't my work.
[1:54:10] It's what you yielded to.
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; You couldn't help it.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; Are you understanding? You couldn't help
[1:54:16] it.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; There was things that you and I were in
[1:54:19] that we loved.
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; Hello. We love the world.
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; We were in the world because our nature
[1:54:28] was like that.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; But what started to turn our nature?
[1:54:34] The Holy Spirit.
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. His word never changed. You
[1:54:39] might have sat in a message church for
[1:54:41] 20ome years. God never changed his word,
[1:54:44] never changed the message. He changes
[1:54:46] our thinking about it.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; And you know where that thinking is? In
[1:54:50] our heart.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; What did that? Somebody who loves you.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; And can't you have faith in what he's
[1:54:59] promised you? Then real genuine love
[1:55:02] will create a confidence in his love.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He caught me when I was
[1:55:10] nothing. I'm still nothing, but I'm in
[1:55:12] his hand. He caught me and he loved me
[1:55:14] when I was unlovable. He loved you when
[1:55:17] you was unlovable, but he changed you.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; Think about that.
[1:55:22] Think about that. You, you and I, we
[1:55:25] were unlovable. And remember, the
[1:55:26] prophet tells us he had to give us a new
[1:55:28] spirit so we could even get along with
[1:55:29] ourselves,
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; right? And a new heart, new way of
[1:55:33] thinking. God had to do that. God did
[1:55:35] that. But he didn't stop there. Aren't
[1:55:37] you glad? He said, "Then I'll put my
[1:55:39] spirit down there." That's right,
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; God. The way he has been opened up and
[1:55:42] then I'll put my spirit in the midst of
[1:55:44] you and I'll cause you to keep my ways
[1:55:46] and walk in my word.
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Just like the colored
[1:55:50] sister said at the time of her
[1:55:52] testimony, "I'm not what I ought to be,
[1:55:54] not what I want to be, then I'm not what
[1:55:57] I used to be."
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; She knowed she had come somewhere,
[1:56:03] something had happened, and that's the
[1:56:05] way it is.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:09] not what I was. I'm not what I want to
[1:56:11] be. But I know one thing for sure.
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; I'm not what I used to be.
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; And with that revelation right there
[1:56:21] gives us the strength
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; and confidence to master the
[1:56:26] circumstances
[1:56:28] that would be faced in our lives.
[1:56:31] Whether it's complex, whether it's
[1:56:33] offense, whether it's healing, whatever
[1:56:35] it is, sir,
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; might be a loved one, a loved one that's
[1:56:38] gone wayward toward, it gives us
[1:56:40] confidence
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; in his word.
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; And it creates a perfect faith in the
[1:56:46] midst of that circumstance to trust God,
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; look beyond. Don't you love him?
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Let's just pray.
[1:56:57] Heavenly Father.
[1:57:01] Oh God, no wonder
[1:57:03] when they would go,
[1:57:07] the songwriter who would write the song,
[1:57:11] the love of God.
[1:57:14] No wonder, Lord, that inspiration like
[1:57:16] your prophet tells us,
[1:57:19] men that are inspired,
[1:57:22] they come to a real fine line
[1:57:25] in their minds
[1:57:28] in those times. very very crucial moment
[1:57:32] to be able to break back into that place
[1:57:34] of reality or back into that place
[1:57:38] because that man in under that
[1:57:40] inspiration
[1:57:42] how that can go in many different ways
[1:57:44] and here he was he wrote on the wall
[1:57:49] of a insane institution sitewart the
[1:57:53] love of God how rich and pure
[1:57:57] just another testimony
[1:57:59] that the love of God never fails.
[1:58:03] That man's mind might have failed
[1:58:05] natural.
[1:58:07] There might have been heartaches in his
[1:58:09] life. I don't know. I I don't know the
[1:58:11] story about his life.
[1:58:14] The writer, Lord, it's it's unknown, I
[1:58:16] believe.
[1:58:18] But that just goes to show as your
[1:58:20] prophet said that certain things could
[1:58:23] come around our way. He says it like
[1:58:24] this in the message testimony. A fever
[1:58:27] might come and cook our brain. But
[1:58:29] that's why it's important to accept the
[1:58:31] Lord Jesus while we're in our right mind
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; because the Lord though that man's mind
[1:58:38] maybe how he would have been declared
[1:58:41] maybe the what he was dealing with. I I
[1:58:42] don't know. But I do know this that once
[1:58:45] the seal of the living God has come on
[1:58:48] the inside,
[1:58:50] your prophet says, Lord God, even as a
[1:58:52] person, he talks about even some as they
[1:58:54] would get older and maybe lose their
[1:58:56] mind. He would talk about somebody going
[1:58:58] completely insane in the demonology
[1:59:00] series. He said, "But if that seal, if
[1:59:02] that seal of the Holy Ghost is upon that
[1:59:04] soul, that don't have one thing to do
[1:59:06] with that soul." Oh God, I'm so glad for
[1:59:09] the message of the hour.
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:14] Lord, to me that's a living proof that
[1:59:18] charity never fails.
[1:59:20] Certain things about our lives, even
[1:59:22] things right now that we're able to do,
[1:59:24] if you Terry, we won't be able to do
[1:59:26] them after so long a time and so long of
[1:59:29] years,
[1:59:30] but charity
[1:59:32] never fails.
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; The love of God in that man's life, he
[1:59:37] would yield and come under that
[1:59:38] inspiration and begin to write. The love
[1:59:40] of God,
[1:59:42] how rich and pure, how measurless and
[1:59:46] strong, it shall forever more endure the
[1:59:50] saints and angels song. Oh God,
[1:59:55] I pray, Father,
[1:59:57] Lord, if there's one here tonight that
[2:00:02] has not come to that place to really
[2:00:04] know the love of God, the love that you
[2:00:08] have for them.
[2:00:10] May they look away, Lord. I pray.
[2:00:14] May they catch a glimpse
[2:00:17] of how that you came down
[2:00:20] and you took upon flesh,
[2:00:23] made in the likeness of sinful flesh,
[2:00:25] became one of us,
[2:00:28] that you might understand us.
[2:00:32] But the top priority is that you might
[2:00:34] redeem us.
[2:00:36] You might pay the price and make a way
[2:00:39] that we can come back
[2:00:42] into your presence, Lord.
[2:00:46] Oh God. Hallelujah. Where the blood of
[2:00:49] bulls and goats could never do away with
[2:00:53] sin.
[2:00:54] It only could cover.
[2:00:58] But God, it spoke through the innocency
[2:01:01] of those animals that there would come
[2:01:03] an innocent one who would die for the
[2:01:06] guilty.
[2:01:07] Oh God, how we're so thankful. May that
[2:01:10] revelation break, Lord, over the life
[2:01:12] and heart tonight. May they see it was
[2:01:15] not a demand.
[2:01:18] This lamb, his life was not demanded.
[2:01:24] Hallelujah.
[2:01:25] Glory be to God.
[2:01:27] The Bible said, "For the joy he endured,
[2:01:30] for the joy that was set before him."
[2:01:34] Glory be to God.
[2:01:37] Glory be to God.
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus,
[2:01:42] you endured the cross. You endured the
[2:01:44] humiliation. You endured that. Lord God,
[2:01:47] you endured
[2:01:49] that time of separation
[2:01:52] for the joy that was set before you.
[2:01:55] that you would look ahead in time and
[2:01:57] see the result
[2:02:00] of that decision where it would take
[2:02:03] darkness and where darkness was and
[2:02:05] lives that were under sin, under the
[2:02:08] muck and gum of this world, Lord God,
[2:02:11] and in despair, but the light of
[2:02:13] Almighty God would move down, Lord God,
[2:02:15] and break chains. illuminate hearts and
[2:02:18] lives, Lord, and lead us from under the
[2:02:21] grip where Satan was holding us. and
[2:02:25] bring us into the kingdom of your dear
[2:02:26] son. You saw the joy, Lord God,
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; of what would be produced through and by
[2:02:33] the renting of the veil, the opening of
[2:02:35] that blood cell and the sending back of
[2:02:37] your life. You saw the joy, Lord,
[2:02:41] our lives being transformed.
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; You saw the joy.
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; You looked beyond the cross.
[2:02:51] And because you went to Calvary,
[2:02:55] we now Lord
[2:02:57] by the grace of God
[2:03:02] have been accepted in the beloved
[2:03:05] the spirit of God coming and making real
[2:03:08] to us. I wasn't there. I wasn't there
[2:03:13] 2,000 years ago as far as in this
[2:03:15] corporal body, this physical body, but
[2:03:18] we were in you then.
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:22] We were right there in you then.
[2:03:24] We went to the grave in you. And when
[2:03:27] you got up on that Easter morning, we
[2:03:29] got up with you.
[2:03:31] Every one of the attributes,
[2:03:34] genes of God
[2:03:36] were right there. As your prophet said,
[2:03:38] he made me pay for my sins. Right there,
[2:03:41] Lord God. And now the spirit of God is
[2:03:45] sent back to make it real to us, Lord,
[2:03:47] to raise us from death unto life. What
[2:03:51] What is this? What is it that has come
[2:03:53] among us? The love of God.
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:57] &gt;&gt; Rich and pure.
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; Not the idea of a man,
[2:04:02] not the emphasis of a man,
[2:04:06] but the love of God himself
[2:04:08] and the grace of God calling out grace.
[2:04:12] grace unto it
[2:04:16] that there's no situation,
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; no condition,
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; that grace
[2:04:23] is not able to take care of.
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; Oh God, thank you Lord. Thank you for
[2:04:30] finding us, Lord.
[2:04:32] Thank you for spend Lord sending your
[2:04:34] spirit after us.
[2:04:36] &gt;&gt; I want to bring it right here tonight.
[2:04:37] Thank you for finding us in our
[2:04:39] thoughts. Amen.
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; Thank you for finding us, Lord, through
[2:04:42] this week and through this day, Lord
[2:04:43] God.
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, Lord. Thank you, Father.
[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, for your mercy.
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory be to God. Maybe you got a
[2:04:57] need on your heart. You just want to
[2:04:59] make it known by an uplifted hand to the
[2:05:01] Lord. Lord, my confidence is in you,
[2:05:03] Lord.
[2:05:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, God. Your word, Lord. You're not a
[2:05:07] man that you should lie.
[2:05:09] God, your word cannot fail cuz you
[2:05:11] cannot fail.
[2:05:13] &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm trusting in you, Lord.
[2:05:15] Whatever that need is, that that
[2:05:17] petition, our love, reaching back to him
[2:05:21] and faith is mastering that it's over.
[2:05:23] And I know and faith is not about
[2:05:25] knowing how.
[2:05:27] That's not what faith is. But faith is
[2:05:31] just that simple deposit. It's a
[2:05:34] substance
[2:05:37] of things hoped for, expected.
[2:05:41] We're expecting you, Lord, according to
[2:05:44] your word. Glory be to God.
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[2:05:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; Granted, Lord, I pray, Father.
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord. Even among our families,
[2:05:56] among our homes,
[2:05:58] help us to put the right emphasis. Lord,
[2:06:01] &gt;&gt; yes, Lord,
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; help us to put the emphasis in the right
[2:06:04] things. Lord, help us not to put the
[2:06:06] emphasis upon natural things of this
[2:06:08] life. We have to have natural, Lord, as
[2:06:11] far as education and other things we
[2:06:14] have to do. That's true. But Lord God,
[2:06:17] as your prophet would tell us over and
[2:06:19] over, and I think two messages, God's
[2:06:21] power to transform and power
[2:06:22] transformation, he said, "Don't ever let
[2:06:24] education become your God."
[2:06:29] Lord, I believe you've given us skills.
[2:06:31] I believe you've given us talents,
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; but I want it all to be under you, Lord.
[2:06:39] &gt;&gt; I want it to be under you. Granted,
[2:06:41] Lord,
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; in our homes, may every mother, every
[2:06:44] father, may we put the right emphasis,
[2:06:46] Lord,
[2:06:49] emphasize the right things.
[2:06:51] emphasize not only the word but
[2:06:53] emphasize the character of Christ with
[2:06:56] our children, our loved ones. May we
[2:06:59] emphasize
[2:07:01] the right things, Lord.
[2:07:04] So Lord,
[2:07:06] be the emphasis through us.
[2:07:10] How many would ask that? Lord,
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; be the emphasis
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; of my life.
[2:07:16] Be the emphasis of my life. Lord, let it
[2:07:20] be Christ
[2:07:22] and Christ alone.
[2:07:25] Hallelujah.
[2:07:27] Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:07:30] Could we just Could we just take just a
[2:07:31] few moments to worship him? He I know he
[2:07:33] deserves more than that and I've kept
[2:07:34] you. I've went a little longer here. Go
[2:07:37] ahead.
[2:07:39] We bow our hearts.
[2:07:44] We bend our knees.
[2:07:48] Oh spirit come make us humble.
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; Oh yes Lord
[2:07:57] we turn our eyes
[2:08:01] from evil things.
[2:08:05] Oh Lord we cast Lord.
[2:08:11] So give us clean hands.
[2:08:15] Give us pure hearts.
[2:08:18] [Music]

[2:12:25] &gt;&gt; Many different needs Lord that's among
[2:12:27] us. There's many that's went up. Prayer
[2:12:30] request uplifted hands.
[2:12:34] And Father,
[2:12:36] those needs, Lord, that we've brought
[2:12:38] before you, Lord, even this prayer
[2:12:41] cloth, Lord, that I've preached with and
[2:12:42] I hold in my hand, Father, I pray, dear
[2:12:45] God, Lord, as we stand here,
[2:12:49] your prophet would say it over and over.
[2:12:51] We're not St. Paul, but you're still
[2:12:54] God.
[2:12:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:55] &gt;&gt; And Lord, I I say it tonight. I'm not
[2:12:57] St. Paul. I'm not William Brandham, but
[2:13:01] you're still God.
[2:13:02] And we're your children, Lord.
[2:13:05] &gt;&gt; Now, Father, I pray God the same
[2:13:07] quickening power
[2:13:09] &gt;&gt; that Lord has changed our lives, Lord,
[2:13:12] turned our lives around, dear God. I
[2:13:15] pray, dear God, that Father, as this is
[2:13:18] applied, Lord, God, may every evil
[2:13:21] spirit be driven back, Lord God.
[2:13:24] &gt;&gt; May the grace of God move down, Lord, I
[2:13:26] pray in that room, Lord God. May the
[2:13:28] spirit of almighty God just move and
[2:13:31] take control, Lord God. Grant him, Lord
[2:13:34] Jesus. But Lord, as your prophet said,
[2:13:37] he said, there's an old God dishonoring
[2:13:40] proverb that says that God helps those
[2:13:42] who can that that'll help themselves. He
[2:13:44] said, but no, God helps those who cannot
[2:13:47] help themselves.
[2:13:49] &gt;&gt; And Lord Jesus, you see this need, Lord
[2:13:52] God. Now, Father, you're still the same
[2:13:56] light that penetrated that darkness
[2:13:58] there, Lord, in Genesis 1. You're still
[2:14:00] the same God, Lord, that moved back the
[2:14:02] darkness in our lives, Lord. Father, as
[2:14:05] Paul said, some at one time we were
[2:14:07] darkness, Lord, but now are we light in
[2:14:09] the Lord. So, Father, our confidence,
[2:14:12] our rest, Lord God, is Father, in the
[2:14:14] grace of God that Lord drove back the
[2:14:17] darkness from our life, Lord. and where
[2:14:19] the light of God has come in Lord to
[2:14:21] illuminate our lives. I pray heavenly
[2:14:24] father may the great value of Calvary
[2:14:26] Lord God and your resurrection Lord your
[2:14:30] word that you've sent in this hour Lord
[2:14:32] God may it Lord I pray God move Lord in
[2:14:36] a very special way Lord may the waves of
[2:14:39] the Holy Spirit Lord I pray move Lord in
[2:14:43] this moment for this need you see the
[2:14:46] need Lord of this young lady's life and
[2:14:49] we ask it now Lord for your glory we ask
[2:14:52] it Lord Lord, in the name that's above
[2:14:54] every other name, the name of the Lord
[2:14:56] Jesus Christ. For there is no higher
[2:14:59] name. There is no greater name than the
[2:15:02] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. It is
[2:15:04] through that name that every devil must
[2:15:06] bow, every demon must bow, Lord God. For
[2:15:09] it is through that name, Lord God, that
[2:15:12] hell was defeated, the grave was
[2:15:14] conquered, Lord God, and the victory was
[2:15:17] won, and the Holy Spirit was sent back,
[2:15:20] Lord. So in the name of Jesus Christ,
[2:15:24] &gt;&gt; house of hell give way
[2:15:26] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[2:15:30] glory of almighty God.
