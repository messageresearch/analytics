where the Philippian Jailer was told believe on the Lord and thy and thy house shall be saved and the prophet tells us he says what it is as soon as you believe there is a faith that is released to you that will lift you above the things of the world it's a faith that comes from God it lifts us so it's not us it's not me quitting this quitting that no it's God's faith moves in and it lifts us above that and it's where our whole the whole point is God working to bring our will in line with his will and that's all we want to do tonight we just want to yield to the Lord and just let God have his way I want to say it's it's so good to see the young people that are here I know there's been sickness in different places and we've had dealt with some even in the assembly but it's good to be

uh to many others so it's just been a great blessing and it's such an honor for him to be able to be here with us and we just want to pull on the gift of God and and so um we want to have brother Paul

song it was 16 years old when I fell in love the the Lord got filled with the Holy Ghost and it's a privilege always to tell the young people that that God got a hold of me then and changed my life I wouldn't trade my journey for anything and it really was I can say it was that it's not it wasn't books and tapes and even Bibles it's it's the person of Jesus Christ that became real to me through the word through the message through my Bible but I met a person I fell in love with him and that's that's what it needs to be praise the Lord can you say amen amen praise the Lord [Music] why do they leave isn't this message still the same why do they see for something more than Simplicity why do they turn turn their backs on you oh Lord why do they ear for something more your truth is what I follow it'll still be true tomorrow what I believe was not the work of any man his kingdom can be Shen all this glorious Foundation While [Music] others here I [Music] I know you said I know you said there's a great falling away I know they try I know they try to complicate what you say but in my soul but in my Soul I'm sure of the rock I stand upon one thing I know one thing I know I will your truth is your truth is what I follow it will still be true tomorrow but I believe was not the work of any man his kingdom can be shaken on this glorious Foundation While others fall Here I Stand On Christ the Sol like I stand all of the ground is [Music] seeking fall while fall while fall while fall while LS Falls fall here I stand yes here I stand your truth is your truth is what I follow it'll

other here I stand prise the Lord let's stand together tonight praise the Lord what I believe is not the works of any man open our Bibles to Isaiah 1 tonight if you would excuse me Isaiah 6 Isaiah 6 and verse one every can everybody hear got it okay all right all right Isaiah 6 we're going to read together Isaiah 6 tonight verse one and God bless you all thanks for inviting me you know uh there's so many good great young ministers now I I rarely get invited to youth things anymore and if I do I defer it to somebody else like brother Nathaniel I've heard some good things about his courtship teaching we want to hap him over brother Samuel's done youth things for us I'm getting too old for this but I like to hang around the young people because I can stay young I love young people so thanks for inviting me tonight the pastor in the church I appreciate it so much but yeah I'm I'm deferring to some of this you know brother Alex is here and these guys young blood coming up boy they just have a lot more energy and I'm just excited about the army that God's raising up you know somebody said the other day said I don't know what we're going to do if that one brother if he if he goes off the scene I don't know what the bride's going to do I say what I said the bride's going to be just fine that's it the bride will be just fine he always has the fful ministry to take his people and you know brother vman says he said Luther had one light and then they come further and advance in the word Wesley had one Pentecost and he said now the message has advanced beyond that and then he said if there is another generation they will go beyond us can you say praise the Lord so God's in charge of the Holy Ghost is in charge of all this and so but we do appreciate you so I hope I hope I can share something tonight out of the word of God would be a blessing to you an encouragement to you in your journey and uh it's a challenge these These Times is a challenge for young people there's many challenges there's many things that we can talk about but we love you the lord loves you and he knew that you would be here in this time in these challenging situations and so he he knows all things and he knows how to take care of you during these times and lead you to the right things just one verse here Isaiah and verse one in the year that King Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple father may you bless your word tonight may you just be with us Lord and come near us and Lord through your word when it's lifted before the people then Lord the the P your the person steps in and you're able to give Revelation you're able people to come near the youth Lord and Lord when they meet you as a person something just becomes real in their heart and there's a foundation LED in laid in their life and Lord we just pray that you help us and you strengthen us Lord and give us Grace tonight for this service in Jesus name amen God bless you ask you to pray for our wife my wife I just dropped here at the motel she's having some sickness there and so just remember her in prayer she wanted to be here tonight and she's listening so remember her in prayer if you would I want to speak about Isaiah a little bit tonight but not just Isaiah and what he went through here but I think it would be a good uh text Brother Bram took this text and talked about young people a little bit under the message influence and he read this scripture there's much that we can learn out of the life here of these two young men and so I I want to look at this just a little bit tonight I trust it'll be a blessing to you in the year King Uzziah died I saw also the Lord so that particular year in uh in Isaiah's life was a a a special year it was uh you know I'm sure he had his whole life but this particular Year God had some changes for Isaiah and he came to a turning point in his life Isaiah came to a turning point in his life and God ordered certain things to happen that he didn't expect with his buddy his friend Uzziah they had grown up together and so he come to this year and that says a lot in the Scripture it says a a lot about what's what's going to happen as Isaiah said in the year that King Uzziah died someone a friend had gone on and and he had rebelled and he had took taken a different direction that even Isaiah didn't catch what was going to go on in his life he he took a different direction but it was a good thing because he said in the year that he died that would seem like a bad thing but the only good thing about it is that it ran Isaiah towards the temple and it ran him into the temple and he says in the year that that happened I saw the Lord in this year this tragic thing happened but it there was a good thing that come out of it because I ran towards the Lord and I saw the Lord and he caught a vision of the Lord can you say praise the Lord praise the Lord and sometimes we have certain things happen in our life that we don't understand or maybe it's very hard to go through and uh certain situations it might be a domestic situation or it might be a church uh tension situation and and don't be fooled all the young people see this thing going on in the church or going on in the in the message or whatever they're not fooled they watch things they see things and there's some good there's a lot of good that happens but sometimes the devil's working and there's negative things and don't think the young people don't see that they don't they don't see that going on we're not going to pretend that it doesn't go on but you see sometimes things happen in our lives that are they bring an end to something they they they they bring something that we didn't expect it to happen but always be looking for the Lord and always be running towards the Lord during those times because God may have something better for you down the road so sometimes it's a loss of a friend sometimes things can happen and we may may not even like what happens but often it turns out the very best thing that can happen to us God may have something better in mind let me say it this way God always has something better in mind can I get an amen the god that we serve always has something better in mind for you than what you have now the god that we serve always has something better down the road so now in our trials in our misunderstandings in our things in our life process it may be a loss of a friend it may be a loss of a relationship it may be breaking up I don't know what what could take place but we must always be careful that we're not realizing what God can do during those times now you know I'll just use an example when we had years ago when we had a lot of people maybe exiting and people going this way and that way and bringing seeds of Doubt Upon Our precious message when that happened you know the good thing that come out of it is it drove people to find out what they [Music] believed can you say it's a bad thing to lose people but it drove people to get in the word and get closer to Christ and find out what their Foundation is matter of fact my daughter that song actually came out of that time where things were uncertain and people exiting and different things that song came out of that because it drives you to realize what Foundation you're on and to make a declaration your truth is what I follow it'll still be true tomorrow and what I believe is not the works of any man this is anchored in God's God's stability and God's faithfulness to his people and in this generation he sent a message because he was faithful to God's people the message is exactly what we needed amen but sometimes out of our trials and sometimes out of things that we lose uh God always has something better he can remove things out of our life but then he can bring something better and we're thinking I want that I want that I want this but he can have a better life for you and you think you have it good but he has something better in store I love a god like that I love to serve a God that I that the expectations can be high because he has something better for us young people he's got something better for you young people he has great things in store for you I has not seen or ear have heard what he has prepared for them that love him and it's just that we love him you know got to go through a whole seminar of something it's those that really love him and it's the people that love him really love him I have not seen what he's prepared for them I can serve a god like that I can love a god like that the expectation is high Bible says every good and perfect gift comes from the Father scripture says Jesus said I come come that you might have life but not just life I come that you might have life more abundant I can serve a god like that I can fall in love with a god like that that he not only wants us to have life but he wants us to have Abundant Life oh blessed be his name Hebrews says about the Old Testament Saints and these all having obtained a good report through faith receive not the promise God God having provided some better thing can I get an amen some better thing for us look how those Heroes of the Old Testament my what they but we we we we we learned about them in Sunday school and they just my there're just wonderful people and what they had they had God but yet he says they're waiting on us they can't be perfect without us and all that was held up because why God had something better for us God had something better for you amen I love a god like that so there's good and there's better and uh I would rather have that which is better I'd rather have a life that's better in fact when you surrender to the Lord God has his very best in mind for you whatever you can come up with will never be as great as what God can give you sir if you're looking for a wife which a lot of you are young you shouldn't be looking for a wife but if you're looking for one you can come up with a lot but what God has in mind is better yes sir looking for a husband uh you can come up with a lot of things but what God has in mind is better that's right and it's the best for you that's right can you say praise the Lord breakups can be bad and I just looking at Isaiah's life here and so God takes this close friend off of the scene he gets lifted up in Pride he takes a direction and your friends will do that sometimes they'll take a direction you're going you know I I don't know why he's taking that direction we were buddies we were friends we were and we were honoring God and we were serving the lord we were on the front row together we went to camps together and then sometimes that that friend just starts to take a turn they get lifted up in Pride or they take a turn in another Direction and you're feeling uncomfortable with you what what's going on and and and so there has to be a a breakup sometimes and sometimes the breakup Your World falls apart it's a difficult thing I want remind you that early on in Abraham's life who is our Father Abraham he had to order a separation from family they were there was contention started to happen because lot and his wife's heart had got their eyes on towards the world and so they didn't know what the tension but God said God ordered a separation Abraham said I love you lot I love you but but you're going to have to choose a way there's going to be have to be a separation and we don't like that because we get emotionally get CH attached but you know what some of the best things that can happen is sometimes a separation from the wrong friend right from the wrong influence and if you're not willing to separate and God's leading you that way then you might run into more trouble but sometimes God is loving you to separate that relationship because he's got something better in mind for you Abraham and so you know breakups you know you have a a boyfriend break up with you sometime and we've dealt and talked to a lot of young people and we have some in our church and they form relationships and there's nothing wrong with that but if if it starts to have fruit of the wrong thing then some and it gets worse sometimes then you got to step back and look and I give them advice if they're asking for my advice I give them say listen this this this Union is not producing the right thing this is not a good thing and then there's a breakup and it's all terrible breakup especially breakups are terrible if you've quickly given your heart too much to that person because the way the heart works is that you God made us a certain way and so if you really quickly bond in the wrong way I try to teach young people there is a bonding that should happen first and that's spiritually you both have the Holy Ghost you can Fellowship on what the Lord's showing you you have a connection and a Oneness about the Lord first you connect in the soul first the world's got it all backwards and they connect physically first the first night they're connecting physically the devil has messed it all up but you connect spiritually first with that person something happens and then as you grow in your relationship and courtship then you begin to bond emotionally and begin to talk about different things and you start getting closer and things and so that's a real that can be a real good thing if you're going on it's the will of God but if you make Bonds in your emotions and your mind too quickly and it's not the will of God it's awful hard to break those bonds that's right and why is that because that's the way God's made us he's built us to bond with a mate someday spiritually emotionally and physically after the wedding day I just want to I just want to bring that up the bonding if we if we all forgot the bonding physically is after you said I do I should get better amens than that now now this is still the truth right the world has messed it all up it's messed with our mind but listen a couple should Bond spiritually first matter of fact brother BR says you better get a boy with the Holy Ghost he'll mess your life up it'll be hell on Earth for you if you have to wait until you're older you wait until you get that boy that's got the Holy Ghost until you find that girl that has the Holy Ghost that's right cuz your worst miserable day as a single person is better than a wrong marriage right woo take your worst day of being single and said no I don't I don't have anybody I'm a girl and I'm becoming an old maid well how old are you well I'm 20 years old and I feel like an old maid and there's nobody out there for me there's nobody I've had them tell me this in my office there's nobody out there I just feel like I'm going to get left out and all my friends are getting married and and I just I I feel I know what it is to be despised and rejected of all [Applause] men I'm feeling this right now all I can be myself right I'm already doing it so I know what it is there was one older girl she was uh about 40 years old and she wasn't married yet 35 I think and she said you know what I'm I'm I'm I'm actually making a request there's going to be no men bearers at my funeral and they said why because they wouldn't take me out when I was alive and they're not going to take me out when I'm [Applause] dead oh and then there's a breakup and because you form bonds the breakup is harder you didn't give yourself no exits you didn't say let's let's just take this slow and see if it's the will of God first young people through social media they can move pretty quick in a relationship and parents don't know about it Pastor don't know about it you know we got guys saying I love you within the first two weeks or third week I'm just going to say it those are strong words that's right they're not to be cheapened that's right and I don't think that you should use that term to somebody that you don't know you're going to make a commitment to and it's it's quiet because it becomes normal to just I love you I I think I love you you think you better know and all these guys are making these commitments with girls and nobody knows what's going on and they're saying I see a future with you and all these other comments I can just see the vision of us together and he's only known her two weeks he don't have a job he barely brings his Bible to church and he's he's making what I call bonding comments with that girl and I think if you make bonding comments I think you be ought to be ready to back it up with a commitment and if you don't if you're not ready you have no business playing with that girl's heart girl you have no business playing with that guy's heart that's right because girls can do the same thing oh they get all Twitter baed and oh I think he likes well how long have you known him I just met him at church but I'm going he came through the cafeteria and I dropped my my scarf and he picked it up and he gave it to me and walked off and I think he's the one he's he's so Christlike I see that character in him what's his name I don't know but I just feel like this is the one girls are just as bad they're worse and giving their heart too quickly to somebody you know a guy just says a few things and she's ready to order the flowers for the wedding sometimes sometimes a breakup as hard as it is is the best thing that can happen to you abely because God has a blueprint for your life and if that's not the one I went with a couple girls and I I actually thought this was going to go the right direction and God just stepped in and if I hadn't been obedient and follow through with my prayer and say I got I want your will Lord I'm neutral I'm neutral you better be neutral when you say it because when God orders a separation then then and here's another thing you treated her like a sister you treated each other like a brother and sister and you have no regrets to the relationship you don't have to go and repent of a bunch of stuff you keep it General you keep it brotherly sisterly until God leads you to the next step and you can step on a firm foundation that I believe I can step into courtship and step into engagement because God has God has led me to this person this is none of this is in my notes but I'm giving it out anyway but if you give your heart too quickly uh and then there's a breakup my it's just terrible and people go through distraught depressing times you know when there was a breakup with a boy in the church breakup with a girl and the girl's going through weeks of depression she's on the couch and she's she's you know eating ice cream every night she's eating gallons of ice cream and you know and she tries to call the guy and says you you know you're the reason for the Teardrops On My Guitar right now and you know and and then he calls back and said I don't really care here's a quarter call somebody who cares he's singing that back to her and I can't believe you treat me that way we I thought this was it he said because you you you formed bonds too quickly that's right and I don't care how much you think sometimes it's the right thing let God give you time to show you that it's the right thing one of God's greatest assets to show his will is time and the more time you can give something the more he can give you green lights or red lights and if you get red lights you better stop it's a good idea it's going to be an accident Hallelujah sometimes if you're listening God is calling for a separation and it's the best thing that can happen there are other breaks up breakups in life besides a guy and girl though God orders a separation from Abraham God orders breakups breakups from influences that are not good for you Uzziah was turned out to be not a good influence for Isaiah and he was blinded by this friendship that he was getting off track and as long as he stayed friends with him he could I would just go and say it both of these men needed a vision of the Lord they were good boys but they needed to catch God's vision and i' say that until you catch God's Vision you better be leery of relationships and friendships that lead you away God may be ordering that because why when God ordered separation from Uzziah and actually took him out of Isaiah's life Isaiah and this is what the prophet said Isaiah got his eyes on off of Uzziah yes sir can I get an amen once he got his eyes off of that influence and off of Uzziah then he can run to the temple and get his eyes on the Lord and actually catch a vision young people you need to catch the vision the vision for this hour the vision of the message first you got to catch God's Vision both of these men young men needed to catch the vision right many young people in our message need to catch the vision they're good kids they're good kids God bless you for your obedience to what the message says but you if you don't catch the vision of this message then it'll never be like it really should be God actually in his grace removed Uzziah out of the eyes of Isaiah so he could catch a vision of the person of the Lord hallelujah and he can see how to approach the Lord he could see those things breakups can be other than just guys and girls God orders breakups sometimes he we break he breaks us up from emotionally connecting with the wrong things God orders breakups from what you're feeding on you're feeding on the wrong thing on your phone and it's an influence don't tell me it's not an influence don't tell me it keeps you from being closer to the Lord there's certain things on your phone that take home in private you have it in privacy but listen sometimes God through the ministry speaks to your heart and he's ordering a separation or a backing off because that thing is influencing your life that's right and if you're addicted to it which by the way they're calling that an addiction now right it's not drugs and and uh you know all these other things but they're calling these things addictions they're actually addicted to it they're addicted to their phone they're addicted to social media it's a new addiction God doesn't want us to be addicted to anything except him can I get an amen Paul said I won't be under the power some things might be expedient for me but all he says all things are lawful some things are not expedient but I will not be brought under the power of any of those things and if you're being brought under the power and influence of something that's where it becomes wrong and God orders a breakup not just from guys and girls sometimes but a breakup for you feeding on the wrong thing and break up the emotional part that goes with it and you might cry you might Rebel for a time but the ones God orders these separations it's a good thing and most of the time he has something better on the horizon for you when we grow up we start oh I love this I love this God gave me this the other night when we begin to grow up and really love the Lord more deeper we start thanking God for not only what he gives us but for what he takes away really good there's a song about it somebody wrote it and I I don't know it but I pulled it up when we start thanking God for what he took out of our Lives amen and not just thanking for what he gives us amen we're starting to grow up because he will take things out of our Lives amen he will well the first thing is take sin aren't you glad he took your sin I'm glad he took that that away from me wash it in the sea of forgetfulness there's a host of things that not God doesn't give us that God takes away from us right and we cry and we hate to lose we lose a loved one we lose a friend we lose the things of the world God Cuts those things from our life and we shouldn't be crying we should be thanking God we should say Lord if this draws me closer to you then I'm glad you cut that out of my life oh I love that praise the Lord we thank God for not only what he gives us but what he he takes away because God in his Loving Grace as I was preaching to my church this morning God in his loving grace is constantly molding us and making us he won't give up on us and we Rebel sometimes and we don't want his forming in his hands to form you know my daughter Ellie is here tonight is she awake my daughter Ellie I play with her all the time Josh and Ry are building a home so they're living with us and that's a benefit because I get Ellie to wake me up every morning in my own house and it's a lot of fun but we do a lot of things together don't we Ellie and one of the things is we get into this thing of of playing with slime I don't know why slime is so important to these young kids but it's become a phenomena slime she wants to watch YouTube videos of people I don't get it but you know what I do it and I play slime with her because she she's my granddaughter and but there's this new thing and they just love to watch people I said what's what the psychological thing going on here because these V these videos are so popular people with their hands in slime just just doing things with it and I'm going what is the deal she likes it and also she likes to play SL so we've been playing quite a bit and the other day I was playing with her and so I she likes to make snakes and different things with it I lately been uh building pyramids with a little piece of slime and I you know she doesn't know what a pyramid is but Papa that looks pretty nice and so she so but when I'm finding I'm learning something through this which is a good thing because I don't see the value of slime at all but the Lord's showing me the longer I spin with that and the longer I keep forming it that pyramid if I just leave it but if I spend an hour with it and I keep gently just touching my finger on and just moving getting all that and making it smoother it gets smoother and smoother and it starts to war and I'm no artist you know can't do this stuff I don't know how to take a I don't have to draw a picture of anything but if I keep working at this slime it really starts to look really really good and it looks good because Ellie says it looks good I make pyramids don't I honey I make pyramids does it look good it it looks good and but as as you allow God to keep forming you and the more time you give even as a young person to keep doing his work it's starts to look beautiful right said w wow I I start complimenting myself this looks pretty nice this this is a nice pyramid you know I could start doing this for a living I said because I took time with it I said ell how you how do you like this and you know what she does she comes over and she goes she sure does so I got to start all over I wonder if God sometimes takes what we're forming and he just goes splurts [Applause] out so let me do this let me do this and he starts over again that's the loving God isn't it he forms us he molds us and he takes away things that are not good for us young people never underestimate what God's doing in your life to take things away from you to get you away from influence that evangelist come in and blasted these things and blasted some of these things and this worldly dress and all this don't don't look at it bad it may be God speaking to you to shed something all your life so you'll run towards God and you have a closer relationship with him through the message we have had light shed on this story of Isaiah and Uzziah I won't get into it tonight I I'll just read one quote but it's more than a story Isaiah and Uzziah is more than a story and it proved that when the prophet talked about it our life is hidden here in this mystery of Isaiah and Uzziah uh our life is hidden when we read the Old Testament when we read the New Testament when we read these types and shadows Christ and his bride Christ is the word Christ is the book and the bride is the words in the book so when we read these stories this one I'm talking about tonight our name our life our spiritual life is written in these Mysteries that's why brother BR takes this message influence so much our day is being lived out in the written stories of the Bible our days being living out and under this Min uh mystery it's real simple and that is we must catch the vision of the Lord seeing the Lord is above all things am that's right good amen is that simple tonight seeing the Lord is above all friendships it's above all entertainment it's above all things in your life that you catch a vision of the Lord changed his life forever changed his vision he knew what he was doing he knew his commission and he went about that Commission because he seen a vision of the Lord I think it's a wonderful thing two men one called to be a prophet one born a prophet and then one called to be a king and they were good guys in Fellowship they were working together they played together they grew up as boys attending church together maybe going to camps together and these two do not have a history of being in the world but in the ranks of the true people of Jehovah this is an example of many of you young people they're not worldly guys that grew up in the world they grew up in the ranks of those that believed in Jehovah God and they were friends and they were both doing it and actually Isaiah could see God honored his kingship of Uzziah because he was obedient to the Lord it was all good it was going good and God even though Uzziah didn't have a vision even though that there wasn't fur something further his life God honored what he did young people God will honor your respect for the word even until you see things God will honor that but I just want to say it's not quite enough until you catch the vision of why you do it it's not deep enough yet it's not good enough yet until we catch the vision and so these two don't have a history of being in the world but they're but they're both in a position that they would come into both being blessed and and and and then they come into their positions very rare positions only there was only 16 uh Old Testament prophets and there's 42 Kings and so now these two young men had the potential now to enter into these positions that were very rare 16 prophets and 42 Kings and they're called uh to a special calling young people tonight you have a special calling you have been chosen by God God has a deeper purpose for your life say well I'm only 13 years old I don't understand all this but listen let me tell you God has a blueprint for your life God has a purpose for your life God has something for you to do God wants you to catch the vision for this hour because I believe you're a part of that vision and you have to catch it to see what God wants you to do but there's a lot of potential when I'm in youth meetings there's so much potential and there's so much energy there's so many things that can be done for the kingdom of God can you say Amen not to waste a life going for the things of the world that's a waste everybody else is doing that everybody else is part of those statistics I don't want to be a statistic of the world I don't want to be I want to dare to be different God has a different calling of man and when you compare yourself with the kid at school or sometimes even somebody around you and say I want to be like that I want you go through those early years of the teens and you're having an identity crisis you don't know who you are yet and that's a struggling time for a team that's the best time to say Lord you show me Who I Am Lord let me look in this book of redemption which by the way this book of redemption that was that had the seals off of it it's the book of redemption but it's the book of identity yes sir that book is a book of identity you start to look in that message and that word that's been open you start to see who you really are you start to see your TR and girls will find their true identity as a Godly girl in that book of redemption guys will find what a real man is a real man of God in that book of identity because what God did as Satan took 6,000 years and destroyed the image of a woman destroyed the image of a man God said I will restore that's right look what God has blessed us with with this book of identity that we can feed on right in the middle of people not even knowing whether they're a guy or girl or not can't even figure out which bathroom to go to how Satan has Twisted the minds of young people and even young children they're teaching it in the schools I say we needed something we needed God to come and give us what a real man is what a real woman is can you say Amen oh this message is dos and don'ts this no no no you missed it you missed it our God knew what we needed in this hour I say God knew what the young people needed this is the book of identity well how do you know it was a book of identity because when it was opened they've all began to worship number one can you say Amen we've been redeemed back to God and thou Hast made us Kings and Priests it's a book of identity I'm not some something of the world God's making me into something God's molding me into rulership and that means that the world doesn't control me through the Holy Ghost I control the world come on now friends come on you know the word the title deed Adam lost it he had control of things instead of things controlling him when he lost that title deed he lost all that power to be able to control things he lost it but when the seals were open God's handing that book back to the people [Music] again Redemption comes into the power of things not controlling us but us controlling things and you young people are blessed in this generation because this isn't just a words of a seventh grade education and just that preacher that's preaching it every Sunday you got to catch the vision because this is far deeper it's deeper than just a prophet it's about Christ the person of Christ it's deeper than just a preacher it's the vision for this hour this message is a vision it's God's Vision so I pray you'd raise your hand tonight say God help me to catch the vision that's my message to you tonight Lord let me everything is catching that Vision seeing the Lord of this message there's the message but then there's the lord of the message there's the Christ of the message and some people get all dis disappointed and the reason is is because they don't see the Christ in this message they only see the outside of it they see it as a dress code they see it as I don't know what all people see it as but God has to give you a vision of Christ the Lord he's the Lord of this message praise be to God I'm excited about what the Lord is doing I'm excited so the these two boys had a really good history to start but later things changed the prophet praised the early life of yiah Uzziah he was a hero to him but then Pride came in he become self- secured self uzai become self-willed self-centered God can't find a way to the heart when a man becomes self-centered and lifted up in Pride become know it alls I know more than everybody I know more than preacher I've had 18yar olds tell me and they know things they know more than their parents they know more than the pastor now they're going to tell everybody what to do I figured it all out you go that direction too far and you move your heart away from God dealing with you because you don't know everything what's the kid come into early teens here and he said you concluded my dad doesn't know anything he doesn't know a thing still saying it at 21 yeah it's about that whole thing I got two sons and you know I I was talking about this last week in Edmonton I thought boy it's just all the stages they all go through and God gives us Grace just to deal with all the seasons and the stages there's nothing wrong with seasons and stages Jesus went through all of them Jesus was a teenager Jesus was a baby why didn't God come just send Jesus go right to Calvary because he had to live out what we would live out Lord you ought to be glad young people when you go to pray struggling as a teenager you go to pray Jesus understands you because he's been here done that got the T-shirt yeah yeah he's been here yeah you ought to be thankful when we go to pray and wonder if God understands you he understands because he was tempted in every Point like we so when we go to pray he understands what you're going through he understands depression he understands being tempted by women he understands being temp tempted by the devil so we can go to him because he lived out every stage of life that we would go through that would be difficult he lived that out so that he can understand his people can you say amen and so so now we should be following him not become self-centered like Uzziah did and when he did it turned bad he put himself in the wrong Authority you know the story but one thing about this they both lacked the vision of the Lord they still had not caught the vision of the reality of God they both needed that in their lives you can be a great young man and a great young woman doing good things but something deeper is to catch the vision of this hour the message of of the hour the Lord of this hour and when you do it will humble you CU When Isaiah caught the vision it humbled him and you will begin serving the lord in a different way and in a deeper way praise be to God I'm going to skip some of this and skip to the end a little bit but listen I'll say just one thing we really need to make sure so many examples I can give not just in young people so many examples through the years of History this message even with preachers you better make sure that you have the vision of what this message is because even preachers can take the people off track and you look at how they go that direction point the people to themselves or all these different moves movements and sometimes you have to say does that man have the real Vision in humility of the Lord of this message amen yes sir hallah huah families unravel sometimes they're going good and then everything unravels and sometimes there just way too much religion in something and people have not caught the vision yet right there's there was a story of a girl she she grew up in this message even in our area over there she's not there now and she grew up in a real it wasn't all her fault she grew up in a real um inbalanced uh picture of the message and it just was real rough on her her but then she had the opportunity to serve the Lord and get past that she didn't she went out and I think she had two or three uh relationships and the world really messed her life up and then she just started to run away as far I don't want to hear she got bitter I don't want to hear Brother braham's name I don't want to hear about the Lord she just become real bitter about it and she ran for probably 10 years she ran from it and she said you know what I'm so sick of this she was in a certain area still had message people I want to go to the furthest place away I don't don't even want to be around people like this I don't want to ever hear it again she moves to California and she I think she gets a cleaning job at a lady's house and she starts cleaning that and then one day this lady sits down and she says have you ever heard of anybody called William brandom that's what I try to get away from she did she got angry in her heart and she goes well well yes you know and and then she begins to tell unfortunately she begins to tell all of her past history and I want to get away from that it's a cult she just goes on and on but this lady had become so positive she didn't even know hardly the message yet but she had heard such positive things it didn't affect her she said well from what I've seen and heard uh God's really doing something in my life as I keep looking at thisen remember now it's not William brandom it's she's met God and that's the distinction yes sir she was already catching the vision this is not about a man this is that I need God I need the Lord in my life this is becoming real to me and you know what happened her influence was stronger than the girl that grew up in the message that didn't have the vision of the message and so she through their testimony for the love through Fellowship she restored this girl's confidence and faith in the message amen moved back to her area got re-baptized and from what I understand serving the lord today with all of her heart why she caught the vision she was blinded by all the stuff that happens in our ranks but you can't be blinded by what goes on this is more than just a a books and tapes this is more than William brandham this is deeper than that this is the vision of this [Applause] hour God brought his vision for this day through the mouth of a prophet but now that Prophet has done his job went off the scene but you young people can still catch the vision amen one great lesson here in Isaiah and I'm trying to just you know I I really don't know what I'm trying to do I'm trying to find a place to end but I I trust this is a blessing for the young people tonight one of the great lessons taught Isaiah and you must learn it tonight watching someone else too much and depending on somebody else too much sir this is a walk with the Lord with you and God and though you go to the camps and though you have friends that's wonderful but don't you ever try to go in on the coattail or go on your friend and you're we're going in together you're not going in together unless you have the right thing yourself you're not going in on the coattail of your parents you're not going in on the coattail of your pastor you're not going in because your pastor is is the pastor your dad is the pastor you're not going in because you go to all the message camps sir that's right this is an individual thing between you and the Lord this is a vision from the Lord you have to see him oh I I remember years ago I don't have this in my notes but I know this is just may not be relevant but it is to me when I one of the grandsons of brother bisco years ago I was in a I was in a uh a Minister's meeting I think you were at one of them Brother Sam and I was in that Minister meeting and brother Bisal was talking about his grandson and all these years and he was only about 14 but he says he ran to him at the car and all these years he's heard these things he grew up in it and he says Grandpa Grandpa I see it I see see it and he couldn't say anything else but I see it Grandpa I see what you're trying to say and he was so excited well what have you seen I don't know I just see it he couldn't explain it all but he's seen the Lord of this message he's he caught something boy 14 years old that's a blessing and he's gone on I could tell you his name but he's serve the Lord he's uh he's done great in the Kingdom of the Lord doing something for the Lord but at 14 he said I see itl I see everything you're preaching and it's not about Grandpa it's about the lord of the message that's right I saw also the Lord I don't know if I might be preaching some people are looking at me real funny I don't I'm not here to become your enemy I hope I'm preaching everything okay and on the word of God but listen now don't get mad at me listen it might be convicting to realize you've been in the message many years in the ranks going to all the meetings you can get excited all you want to but the question is have you caught the vision of the Lord in humility that's right that's right yes sir because then you're not worried about being accepted in the message being seen that's right yes sir not worried about being seen you're not worried about a position wash positions wash away yeah sir yes sir so what does God have me to do doesn't have to be a position when it becomes all about positions the me who's the greatest preacher and who who's the convention speaker we're we're go becoming denominational that's right yes sir that's right God help us yes sir the third poll is to lead us out of out of the things that are a public show the vision is I seen a big tent but it didn't end in that big tent it ended in that little room I'll meet you in there that's right that's right it's not end to with a big bang around the country and a Big Revival around the country it's not supposed to end that way and brother I don't understand why you say I mean why is that that because he's so used to and all the preachers are used to all these healing campaigns and everything's so visible and God did it all God can be visible but I'm just letting you know this relationship in the third pole is not that visible it's between you and God yes sir yes sir he asked the angel he said I don't understand that and so every Vision has to line up with scripture and he took that he says did not our Lord say did not our Lord say that when you pray don't pray out here go into your closet and the father that sees and secret will reward you openly now you're talking the bride's Revival part of it part of it but don't eliminate it this will be no public show but it'll be ever bit as powerful it's sacred it's a sacred place yes sir that she brings and I've been hungering lately Lord take me there take me there Lord preached about it for years but Lord if I'm lacking anything take me into wherever I'm not here trying to interpret it tonight I'm not interpreting the brides Revival I think we should do that sir we shouldn't be seeking for what God's going to do we should be seeking the type of relationship with God that he can do whatever he wants to do and I'm saying Lord take me there take me deeper take me you know that new song take me deeper take me deeper Lord take me there Lord I'm not trying to interpret what it is I'm saying Lord take me there brother Braham says you see that King that had he had made an example before Isaiah and Isaiah seen that King as soon as he got out of his calling well God smoted him with Leprosy and then Isaiah thought what must I do Uzziah was dead he had leaned heavy on his arm Isaiah lean on the arm of Uzziah and he thought he was gone what would he do life itself was gone can you imagine now Isaiah is thinking life itself is gone I've lost my buddy I've lost my friend life is gone for him nearly so what did that young Prophet do he made his way down to the temple to pray he fell down at the altar he cried out if that's if you're going to cry over that not a pity party he cried out to God that's a good crying sometimes God lets the very props be knocked out from under us sometimes he lets sickness strike us he lets disappointments heartaches strike us sometimes he does that to get you where you'd be influenced by the gospel be wise enough to catch it I'm reading brother brandom here be wise enough to catch it don't be stupid enough to walk away from it notice Isaiah know that he must find something different so what did he do he went into the temple he raised up his hands he cried out to God he fell into a vision and as he fell into the vision he saw God Amen not a throne down here but lifted up up God Amen he saw the Lord and his testimony was that in that year it was a special year to me even though I lost my friend but that year is significant because when I lost this I saw the Lord I Saw the Lord hallelujah brother bradam couple places says about the young people uncertain sound 1960 I just wish I was a young fella again 18 20 years old and know what I know and maybe I could stand up a little longer and visit a few more and or something like that for the kingdom of God's sake you listen in you young people this morning that's young and got a lot of Youth in you yet and not family ties and things may God let you see the vision of the hour that we're living in yes yes Lord you don't got a lot of responsibilities you don't got a lot of things you get married you get kids your time is cut in half with every kid it gets cut even more kids got time for yourself right now you got time to serve the Lord with all your heart didn't Paul say it 1 Corinthians 7 he said though those that are unmarried careth for the things of the Lord more you have more time to do that he that's carth he that's married care for the things of his wife and responsibilities and and so you got a day season coming when you get married things will change a little bit but seize the opportunity that's right to catch the vision now right the responsibil come and you know the startling thing that comes on you when you when you realize that a bill comes in and it's got your name on it on what bad people they sent me a bill utility bill I say yeah son that's right Welcome to the Real World yeah and I so I go into their homes now and you you as kids get over you gotta you got to shut up and you got to quit saying things because they know everything like the kid I know I know it and then he got 27 28 H my dad may know a little bit and then they get 40 because when they were 5 years old my dad knows everything when they're 14 he doesn't know very much when they're 21 he doesn't know anything when they're 29 they're saying he might know a little bit and when they're 40 my dad knows everything I don't mean to mock young people hey be you be yourself but you know I go through their houses and I just flip lights on I just FP all the lights on [Applause] secretly secretly but it's a little bit of payback it's things I can't say nothing to them you know because you try when they you know when I had two bodybuilders in my house two bodybuilders they were bodybuilders young dad I you I can pin I can bench I guess this I can bench 250 I well pick up your socks you know you know it's it's really real you know yes sir and one of my sons is getting ready to get married and so you just do things behind the scenes you can't say anything to them but I took his fiance and I felt it important I felt this was a mission of mine to show his fiance to show his room to her I know I know but it's it's things that we have to do to pay back a little bit and and seriously I mean it's I felt that she should know this this is reality this is the guy you're going to marry I know you're in love and you're Twitter ped oh this guy's the best thing but can you just come with me for a minute and look at this room it's a lot of fun raising kids teenagers I I don't regret any of it it's a lot of fun it really is but going back to what brother Bram says you get busy in life things you don't have an opportunity like you have now I'm 10 I'm eight I'm I'm 13 doesn't matter you've got an opportunity to really serve the Lord really being linked up with the Lord real close and many of you are doing doing that and I can see that saying what how can I be used in in the you know that's wonderful praise God but say Lord let me catch the vision right yes and then he goes to 65 when he's speaking to the the young people the graduates come follow me and he says Lord Jesus youth men and women for tomorrow if there is a tomorrow we must train them Lord we feel the burden if anybody wants to know this is a quote that brother Barry and I have have used for 30 some years now as the basis for our retreat in training young people not only should they have the preaching of the Holy Ghost to get an experience but brother Bram says we must train them we must train them as well we must teach them the principles of God don't bash teaching it's part of the word Sir W praise the lord we must train them this is what we use to quote as our basis we must train them like there will that he said we must train them like there will be a tomorrow if there's not a tomorrow then today is the day we feel that burden to train them like there will be a tomorrow so we pray heavenly father that they'll catch the vision now and see and hear that great Eternal invitation come and follow me May each of them Lord turn aside from the things of the world and this more mortal fringy life may young men and women even tonight may they catch the vision for this hour may God remove other things out of your life so you can see the Lord I might say this to end on tonight because it's it's relevant to catching the vision and you know when he says a vision we know prophets when you look up Vision in in Websters it talks about a trance that someone can go into and that's a prophet the Lord takes him into Vision to see things he's specially built for that but the other part of the meaning says to catch a revelation or to catch a revealing so we may not be a prophet to see it like he sees it but the same vision he catches and speaks we catch it by Revelation sir okay so we can all catch the vision and what supernaturally revealed Paul told Timothy Paul was the prophet and then Timothy underneath him he caught the same vision as Paul I have no man like minded he caught the vision so he didn't have to be a prophet say Lord show me a vision like brother brandom you may not be a built for don't ask for that if you're not built for it but you can catch the vision that was sent through the prophet to live it out right I mean this respectfully what's more powerful the one who catches it and sees it and speaks it or the ones who live out the vision that's sir you're the ones called to live it out you're the ones to live about the drama for this hour you see the enemy you see everybody in the drama but I'm not the enemy I'm on the good side in the in the picture for this hour and I'm living and what's more powerful than even a prophetic Vision didn't Jesus say that John was the least in the Kingdom of John he said but he that's least is better than he Abol TR amen not belittling the prophet I'm just saying we lift up that gift so much but you don't realize the vision that he brought is to be lived out in a bride lived out in the new generation I was just preaching this morning about Israel being caught there on the mountain for 38 years they went surrounded a mountain all kinds of immaturities and Fighters and all the and God finally said it's I it's time to stop surrounding this mountain it's time to turn northward but he had already said before because some of you are Fighters because some of you have disobeyed and went up and down I won't even let that generation go in and brother says when the old Fighters die off I'll take the new generation and I'll take them northward and they'll really come into what this message is the promise of this message sir but I wanted to say something before I close about um television the the achievement naturally for every age will have a type to where the Lord's taken the bride how many knows that and so we find then that what is science has achieved in the 20th century when they developed the television it and in this that Century the natural achievements of Sci AR science are a type of what's going on spiritually in the bride so you I know you know that but did you notice as time goes on they keep coming out with screens on TVs that become more and more clear all the time what makes up the picture on a television screen is small dots called pixels and on a traditional analog TV screen there's an effective pixel resolution of 210,000 pixels that's an analog one of the first televisions to bring out the new digital screens have advanced so much they contained about two million now that was 10 years ago two million pixels so so what what's happening now in science is they keep developing developing to put more pixels in there and the more pictures you have the clearer the vision is somebody shout praise the Lord this generation this vision's got to be crystal clear to them and I looked it up last night the new 4ks and I'm not preach promoting TVs here of course but the new 4ks have gone now and they have 8 million pixels in them wow and you go through those stores you see it wow is that ever Crystal Clear praise the Lord what happens in science is happening through the message in the early days maybe this message and what it was it wasn't so Crystal Clear but I can tell you it's coming clearer and clearer and clearer and clearer because God by Revelation just keeps putting more pixels in there and when I go to the message now I don't read it like I did 20 years ago I'll tell you I'm seeing it a lot more clear the Lord's becoming more real to me it's becoming Crystal Clear what his desire is hallelujah that's my heart tonight that's what the message and God's grace is making it more clear and more clear how many of that's been in the faith a little while can say it's becoming more clear yes that's a television that's a television science what they come out with but you see there's a much greater television Prophet C where there is no vision the people perish that's right when God sends a prophet he sends a vision to the people right and when they send that Vision write the vision make it plain clear write the V habac write the vision make it plain give it millions of pixels so what so the people can run they'll not be weary let them run with this message I pray God will raise up an army friends in these young people and fill them so full of the Holy Ghost and this word becomes so pickle perfectly clear that there arises a stir on them to run with this message the young men shall faint the young men in Isaiah will fall but he says he that Waits on the Lord God shall renew the youth he'll renew their strength and they shall Mount up with wings as Eagles hallelujah hallelujah well glory be to God you've been real welcoming tonight if a you here's some resolves young people if you if a Uzziah fails in my life I'm I'm going to run to his Temple or if I've been under the influence of someone or something and not the Lord and his presence then I confess it tonight God forgive me forgive me let me stop that right now let nothing be an influence that's keeping me from the vision of the lord lord open my eyes this year to catch the vision your vision what do you want me to do I can't ask that for you but I'm just just leading you on this is what you can bring before the Lord let my Uzziah die in my eyes let my history be washed away and Lord let me see you only a sister sang a song this morning at the service and he's is really good a good lyric but the course said I've come to the place in my life I have an audience of one amen that's good it's about me and the Lord I'm not trying to please everybody else I'm not putting on a show to everybody else I have an audience of one let all the Uzziah die in my life let my history be washed away let me see Only You Lord become the center of my life wash away my past yes I'm going to keep my eyes on the Lord can you say amen and not on people if you got your eyes on people you'll be disappointed keep your eyes on the Lord be careful how much you put your eyes on the uzas he has the next chapter God has the next chapter for your life because the he's the author of the biography of your life he's holding the next chapter and I can trust the future when I know that he has the book for my life he has the story and so I can trust every next chapter when I know he's the author of my book amen can you say Amen blessed be his name let him be the cner let him be the sinner brother Bill my friend here tonight my associate going overseas we have taken a lot of trips together he's so precious to me I've been praying for you brother Bill I know you're going to get on the other I believe you're going to get on the other end of this and he's he's talking and he'll be singing and God's given him his voice back cuz I still want to take him to Honduras and he interpret for me some there a truth you need to know tonight brother the bill and I taken many mission trips but we're both not missionaries we both have to stay real close to motels that have the golden arches within the distance we've been into some things we took a 10day trip one time and uh we usually stay in the cities but we said okay we'll come out to some of the small churches boy it was rough and there was a lot of bugs and a lot of things and food and things and it's just it's just rough we're not missionaries we come into this real poor place and I like to tell this story we come to and brother Bill you know the thing with him he's got this statement brother Paul we go forward so I'm just I'm getting sick on the food brother Paul we go forward for brother so we'll go down to the restaurant in the motel and order a bunch of french fries and a lot of Pepsi and try to get our stomach straightened out now you may not think it straightens it out but it does it brings the stomach back to normality fries ketchup and Pepsi my wife will not let me have those things here but brother Bill and I we need it to stabilize our stomachs we go forward brother when we're riding you know eight hours in a truck and going like this the entire time I look over at him say we go forward brother Paul got in this real poor Motel it was is this the best motel in town it's the best Motel poor Nicaragua Nicaragua was very poor and I'm getting to a point with this listen we didn't never went to those places unless we caught the vision of this hour that's right and wanted to preach it to the Spanish people because the vision is always greater am than the trials I tell pastors that because pastors can get burdened too but I got to remind them the vision you're preaching this is God's vision and the vision is bigger than the people's problems I needed that one today this is not our vision this is the Lord's and the vision will always be greater and bigger than any other problems right we get into this thing where I'm sitting in the lobby of this place and I said brother Bill can you go ask the man the manager if there's any roaches here if the roaches are low or high or whatever he goes up and talks in Spanish and says and the manager goes yeah yeah yeah no no no roaches no roaches I just sprayed I had them spray yesterday he's saying this in Spanish and brother bill says they just sprayed yesterday it's no problem it's no so he goes on negotiating the motel room for the night and while I'm sitting in the lobby this roach comes from the inside across the Lobby floor right in front of me we're talking big and it's it's walking it's like he's string I said Bill Bill I thought you said they sprayed look at this and he asked the manager and Mar said yeah yeah he leaving he [Applause] leaving that's what he said he leaving I sprayed he leaving I am not a missionary I am not a missionary and we slept there and there was roaches and other things crawling around the ceiling through the night that's right but we're still here we survived oh I just love the Lord just been on a trip with brother Alex back to hondurus in January he get a little taste of it he's probably a missionary I'm not I don't know yet but uh thought you thought I give these yeah he's not so sure he's a missionary now because I give these brothers a little experience you know but we're looking for Miss missionaries to go so I can send them and I don't have to go excuse me for just taking that story but I love brother Bill and I love you and I love to be around the body of Christ I love to be around young people you guys are great and follow the lord ask him Lord just let me catch a vision simply

the the ups and downs the troubles in people the troubles with me oh I'm I would have never make it except as a young man at 16 I caught the vision of what this is I went on those mission trips God gave me and brother Bill we prayed for a few years there we baptized many young people it was a Revival in the young people showing the vision of the Lord for this hour listen I'd never been able to make it except I caught something right this is bigger than me it's bigger than you I pray my prayer tonight is that you catch the vision of the Lord and He he become the center center of my [Music]

our heads and pray together tonight if there's something that you want to draw closer to the Lord tonight you want to just draw nearer to him then you you should pray that prayer and speak to the Lord tonight and even if you're not a young person you should speak to the Lord you should let him know your desires and articulate it from your lips and say Lord this is something I need more of you I need to catch more of your vision maybe you've caught it but you need it become clear how many would raise your hand Lord make your vision clear put more Revelation pixels in there Lord Make It

me know you [Music] are me know you on [Music] you Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord thank you Lord Jesus amen I certainly believe that the Lord has really spoke to our hearts tonight you know I just love how the word the message of the hour it come to do away with all the veils that's why that it it we're not looking and seeing the Lord Jesus Through The Eyes or the lens of someone else when God sends a prophet it's the eyes and God has provided for himself so we're not looking at brother branham's ideas brother bram's thoughts it's not brother bram's opinions it's thus sayith the Lord that's right and so we're seeing Christ for who he really is and as we look at him we find out who we really really are that's right and then when we can catch that as the Lord was saying tonight on catching that Vision you know there's one thing about it that if you have to take your eyes off of Christ to find anything in life a mate a job or anything it's not the right thing for you that's right but everything that God has for you right it should be where you have to continue and you're looking so deep in that Vision till you see his will because every part of God's will what he has in that Vision will never take away of what he has for you and himself in your life yes it will only be a complimenting and an adding to it yes that's why in Real Marriage it doesn't take away it brings everything and all these other attributes everything begins to work in such a proper Channel with a vision of the lord it's not a struggle it brings us into a real rest and I tell you with everything the God's will just God wants to make his will so clear to you and I and I thought there's a lot of points that was so good I I love the teaching I love where it gets down to where that these are things that you can take and apply right in your life you know I I I love I love all that God has for us I love the great bouquet I love the the great EV Evangelistic Services all that has its part there's all all those parts to play but I love the teaching when it gets down because after it's all said and done and you come out of a meeting you come out of a camp you've got to know how to apply the word you've received and you've got to know how to live it and God directs Us in such a way when we've met the person of Jesus Christ my I I so enjoyed it tonight because like the prophet said he said Paul never met a book he met the person of Jesus Christ and when you met him then he becomes the absolute and the word becomes the absolute in our life and then we see the message as the absolute because it's not one taken away from the other it's all Christ being unfolded ain't that beautiful then it's not it's not about dos and don'ts it's actually seeing him for who he really is and seeing yourself for who you really are I tell you there's nobody who can tell you and I who we really are like God can the world the world cannot the world wants to pull this way and pull that way but I'm so thankful for a Clear Vision in this hour I I'm so thankful for that as you heard brother Paul go through that even when he was speaking them latter parts of the mission trips there's a lot of test there's a lot of Trials there's a lot of things that come our way and let me just tell you things are going to come your way whether you serve God or not there's people that have hardships that don't serve God but I'll tell you what when you're serving serving the lord and you've got him first I tell you God will bring you out on top every single time when you put God first God will bring you through and every test every trial all that he brings you through he's molding and making more out of your life he's bringing forth more of him and less of us my every step of the way God gives us the courage gives us the strength this is why I believe this message it comes to bring stability in our life it brings stability to where that even when you don't feel God's presence you've got to have a stability on the inside that you know that you know that you know because there's times you don't feel his presence is that right it's a lot of times it's been said it's very easy to live Victorious inside of Youth Camp but it's when you come out of that that's it it's it's it's when you come out of it that you've got to have that vision of him and that's what stabiliz and that that's the whole goal of this messag you might say well how is that different from every other church because every other Church wants you to catch the vision of some man somewhere else of what his slant and angle is on the word of God but the God sent a message to remove all the veils so you're not running to somebody else and say hey what did what what did Brother Bram say right here what did Brother Bram mean right here what what did so so me God removes all veils you've got direct access am to God right I love that I love that he's a personal God you know what he's never failed me I failed him a lot i' I've failed him a lot but he's never failed me amen God is so good and it's all the principle of yielding and just as the Lord spoke to each of your hearts and I tell you I believe God spoke to everybody's heart here tonight I know he did mind we want to go deeper Lord I want that Vision to become more clear a vision and see myself in that vision and catching that Vision in this hour amen don't you love him how me appreciate brother Paul [Music] [Applause] amen amen you know Brother Paul's he's just a wonderful singer and I and I enjoy his singing But if I had to choose between his singing and his preaching I enjoy his preaching I like his singing but that that's me I I just I enjoy when I enjoy when things get down to the Practical nuts and bolts I love I love that I love when it gets down there amen amen don't you love the Lord amen amen so good to be in his presence tonight amen could we just bow our heads in a word of prayer father thank you for your mercies Lord Lord I once again as we have gathered here and I'm sure the young people I'm sure that they're very very aware of this Lord and may you make it even more real of your love to them your care for this moment Lord Jesus that God that you you knew the time you knew the season you knew the hour you knew the complexities of life not only where they would be Lord as teenagers and maybe in 20 years old and 20 one on and on you knew all of that and you came to understand all of that and you sent a message Lord it was a great care package to express that you really care and Lord we thank you Father for your mercies to us in this hour once again tonight you have made known Your Love upon your children Lord I pray that God that even from this moment this meeting May the hearts Lord from what you've spoken the words let them just resonate Lord just dropping down even on notes that's been taken Lord and things that Lord would just set a trajectory Lord From This Moment Lord just a vision oh God just Lord with a determination that I just want to see the Lord just high and lifted up above every above every sin above every habit above everything in my life whatever that he asked of me I want to let go and I want to let the Lord have his way I want to let him take me deeper and deeper in him because he is worthy of all the praise of everything of all the entirety of our life Lord be with your children tonight Lord be with them Lord bless the different ones Lord as they've come bless Lord as they go on their ways and traveling Lord I pray that Lord You' just bless your servant tonight brother Paul Lord as he labored this morning Lord and then coming here Lord and delivering his heart I thank you for it Lord I Thank you for brother Paul I thank you for the gift Lord
