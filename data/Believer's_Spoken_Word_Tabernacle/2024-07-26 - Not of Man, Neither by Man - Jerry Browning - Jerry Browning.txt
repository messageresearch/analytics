Enlighten us from it their God and strengthen us Lord feed your people tonight I pray and we ask you to receive all glory from this service in Jesus Christ's name amen hallelujah amen uh I'd like to turn if you would to Galatians chapter 1 and we're just going to read the chapter here I I was telling brother Samuel I actually earlier today was looking over things and had studied was putting together some notes and then as the day went on I just wasn't feeling it and uh so I got here and went back and that and so we uh the Lord just directed me to something else and that so uh I want to preach here from the Galatians 1 we'll just maybe take it like a little ible study tonight and what I'd like to title it is not of men neither by man praise God not of men neither by men all right so here Galatians 1 the first chapter Paul uh writes Paul an apostle not of men neither by men but by Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him from the dead and all the brethren which are with me unto the churches of galatia Grace be to you and peace from God the father and from our Lord Jesus Christ who gave himself for our sins that he might Deliver Us from this present evil world according to the will of God and our father to whom be glory forever and ever amen I Marvel that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel which is not another but there is some that trouble you and would pervert the go uh the gospel of Christ but though we are an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be ACC cursed as we said before so say I now again if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have reive let him be accursed for do I now persuade men or God or do I seek to please men for if I please men I should not be the Ser servant of Christ but I certify you Brethren that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man for neither received it uh for I neither received it of man neither was I taught it but by the revelation of Jesus Christ glory for ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews religion how that beyond measure I persecuted the Church of God and wasted it and profited in the Jewish religion above many my equal in my own Nation being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers but when it pleased God who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace to reveal his son in me that I might preach him among the Heathen immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood neither went I up to Jerusalem to them that were Apostles before me but I went into Arabia and returned again into Damascus and then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter and ab Bo with him 15 days but other the apostles saw Li none save James the Lord's brother now the things which I write un you behold before God I lie not afterwards I came into the regions of Syria in Sicilia and was Unknown by faith unto the churches of Judea which were in Christ but they had heard only that he which had persecuted Us in times past now preacheth the faith which was once he destroyed and they glorified God in Me amen you may be seated Hallelujah I uh you know I'm not coming you to tonight to bring to you some uh something perhaps you haven't heard or uh some profound Revelation that you don't already have but I I look at the the time that we're living in and I I look at the uh the things that are going on not so much you know of course we look at things that's going going on in the world and and the the sin that seems to be increasing and the cup of iniquity is getting close to being full in this in this uh time and and so we know that it we're close to the end we're close to the coming of the Lord but more than that you those things they don't really affect us the Believers of this end time truth but one of the other things that we can see that uh you know of course the the the religions of the world the denominations and that wouldn't be able to see these things because they you know they they don't have the truth what they have is by men it did it is man-made uh you know they could they read the same Bible that we read but they they though uh their Doctrine from those things has all been created by man and and and when you think about it and look at it especially over time their doctr on a lot of things has changed in a lot of the denominational churches especially in those that at one time were called the Holiness churches their doctrines and views on a lot of things has changed their view on Holiness uh uh dressing and and and different things like that they've changed you know and uh and the reason they did is because the people want preachers to tell them what they want to hear they want to be able to live whatever life they want to live and still feel like that they're okay and Justified and so you know as the scripture said it would it would happen in these last days where they would Heap to themselves teachers having itching ears in other words people preachers that was going to tell them what they wanted to hear you can cut your hair you're still okay you can wear pants you're still okay you men can do this and that and the other and you're still okay you know and and and and so they a lot of those uh denomination they've changed their views on those things yes sir you know I can tell you this from my own experience from uh the the nomination that my family was associated with uh you know at one time I'll tell you friends they they taught Holiness and that to a thing that you would not have went in their churches back then and seen people dress the way you will go into their churches and see them dress today and I'm not just talking about you know you say well yeah maybe they they you know of course they have uh at one time it the women would have never come into church uh wearing pants they would never even have wore that stuff at home I'm talking about some of these Holiness denominations and things so we can look at that and see they've changed because now now they come in wearing pants suits and all that and I'll tell you it don't stop there you know I don't know the last time you've ever been in some of any of those churches and that but I'll tell you this you can go into some of them and you wonder my goodness this don't look any different than being out here on the street this doesn't look any different than than than all the uh uh you know I don't know uh Hollywood movie stars and everything else it's all these symbols out there in the in this sinful world today they just dress just like them you know and so we see that as changed but that's not something that really affects us the the end time uh Believers of this end time truth but what we can actually see is that there has been things that has changed in people who claim to believe had claimed to believe this message at one time oh yeah and the Bible has prophesied that it would happen that everything that could be Shak would be shaken and and there was there was actually prophesied in the scriptures there was going to be an exodus of people from the truth and and we've seen that people walking away that perhaps sojourned with us uh as message Believers for many years and hear uh people and preachers and and and and and officers in the church and everybody there a lot of them has turned their backs on the message and walked away you know some of them turn their back on the message and go out to a denomination some of them turn their back on the message and just go out to the world some of them turn their back on it and they and they they but they still remain religious you know and and that but uh but what is important is that you actually have a revelation that this is the truth because if you have that Revelation you know and the thing about it is friends it's not something that's that mysterious there is it's actually a revelation of the scripture and God has actually come and Vindicated those things over and over again and when you look here in in Galatians you find that Paul there's like six chapters here in Galatians and Paul all throughout Galatians he's dealing with the fact that the galatian people had began to listen to other Brethren that came amongst them and were actually uh uh uh you know presenting things to them with the truth that had been preached to them and actually leading them from the end time message you realize that Paul was not just a great missionary Paul you know Apostle Paul was actually the messenger to the first Gentile Church age and so Paul was a prophet and Paul was the prophet Messenger to the first church age and so God gave him the Revelation that was going to start the foundation for this Gentile bride and so Paul here as he's dealing with this galatian church he begins to tell them look first of all Paul's saying look I want you to realize this what I've got I didn't get it from man Glory Hallelujah I didn't go up and talk even to the brothers in Jerusalem to get this this Revelation true he said I got this from God himself the Lord revealed this to me he said I didn't go confer with flesh when God came and gave me a sign and and and and God was coming to reveal him son not to me but in me Glory yes sir amen and so Paul begins to deal with them you you started listen to these men that they're mixing a leaving with the truth and he says look God has delivered you unto Grace and you're wanting to go back to the law right right he says God's delivered you to grace that your righteousness is by Jesus Christ and you're wanting to go back to the to your own works of the law to to have to to bring yourself to be righteous and he says that no man can be saved by the [Music] law so these were the things that Paul was dealing with and and these were the so-called message Believers of that day yeah and Paul saying you've begin listening to this one and that one and that he says they've crept in Paul actually says in one place I wish I could I could get them out away from you right right right yeah amen but Paul and when Paul speaks about these men then here he starts it out he says let them be a cursed now that is actually some very strong language that Paul is using you know uh a curse that word a curse it actually is a word uh that that is translated from uh uh the Greek uh Paul actually uses it in 1 Corinthians uh 16 when he says if any man love not the Lord uh uh the Lord Jesus Christ let him be uh anatha Maranatha and Paul uses the Greek words for that and what that means is it it's let the man be a curse uh is what uh anath means uh and maratha means our Lord cometh or will come soon and so Paul uh used this as very strong language but like I said there was these men that had creeped in and they were were trying to lead people away from the truth the message that that had been brought to them by the prophet messenger of that day and so Paul says let them be and he uses this this Greek term here for a curse but actually when you look at the complete translation of of that it actually means to withdraw and separate yourself from these individuals don't Fellowship them it said to draw and separate from all who love not the Lord Jesus Christ all that love not the end time truth you know that actually and look friends I'm not talking we realize we we've got to witness to people we got to bring people in and all that you know but I'll tell you friends there is a line that individuals can cross and we have we have seen that in the ranks of the message where not only just people but actually even preachers that had come in that were supposed to be god-called preachers preaching this end time truth have actually turned did a 180 on it and and and it's and that's not enough for them when they leave they got to make videos and they got to post things online and they got to you know and get all this out here to I'm going to tell you what friends let them be a curse don't watch their videos don't read their stuff you say are you afraid that I could be persuaded no if you are elect you will not be persuaded but why waste your time right if this has been revealed to you look friends this message has been revealed to me it has been revealed to me that William brandham was the end time messenger and prophet of God that was to bring and fulfill the promises of God in the word and restore to this end time bride the the truth that started at the beginning with the first messenger Paul right why do why these different people leave it because it never was a revelation to them and I'll tell you this friends if they're not elect seed of God it's impossible for them to ever get a revelation of it that's it you say why did they stick around so long brother bam said they got an intellectual conception and if that's all any anybody's got an intellectual conception they can be talked out of it they can be reasoned out of it so here in Galatians chapter one Paul begins to express to the people look that I'm the messenger that God has sent and and then he says look I've been Vindicated God has Vindicated me right and and he said look I didn't get this from man God gave this to me amen amen that's the true Hallelujah Paul you know uh Paul actually had been uh trained uh prior to God coming and speaking to him and revealing these things to him Paul had been trained by the great teachers uh of the Jewish religion brother benam said the thing was they were all great teachers of the religion he said but every one of them were carnal he says and everything Paul had been taught was actually man-made you say yeah but Paul talked about uh you know he was schooled in the law and the keeping of the law and all that but you realize friends they had so took the the the religious teachers and things of that day had so took and resculpted the the the the writings in the Old Testament the prophecies and the law on that to when the the Fulfillment of them was coming to pass when Jesus Christ came on the scene they had so resculpted the word that they and the prophecies that they claimed to believe that they didn't even recognize those prophecies coming to pass they didn't even recognize that all of the things that the law and shadows and types that it pointed to was coming to pass when Jesus Christ was [Music] born that's why you see so many of the the you try to sometimes talk to uh perhaps maybe even denominational people or or preachers or teachers within their religions and that and and they they don't want to they don't want to hear you no you try to try to offer a book of of brother Brandon one of his messages I ain't reading that and and and the thing is they are so they're they what they believe is man-made it's been took the scriptures has been took and re and been sculptured and reformed to become whatever their beliefs of and their particular religions are today within their own denomination like brother Ram says none of them can even agree with one another God says he says when God comes he ask one minut who's he going to judge by is he going to judge by the Baptist or the or the Pentecostals or is he going to you know judge by what which one of the religions he going to take to judge people by brother man says he's ain't going to judge by any of that it's all manmade he says he's going to judge it by his word and this is what Paul was presenting to the galatian church I've delivered to you the pure word prise God so anybody that's coming into you and telling you something different than what's been preached right don't listen to them let them be a cursed that's right separate yourself from them Paul was ruled he knew the Old Testament so when when the light appeared to him and he said Lord who are you he recognized that light had to be the Lord amen he said Lord who are you and the voice said I'm Jesus whom thou persecuted right so at Paul's like well this is all I know but I believe what what this voice I know that is the Lord I believe this light I know it's the Lord so then Paul went off for three years to Arabia and brother ROM said what he did was said Paul began to go back over the Old Testament the writings of the laws and the prophets and everything right he says until he saw Jehovah of the old was Jesus of the new and he said he didn't confer like he said he didn't confer with Peter James John or any of them up in Jerusalem after God spoke to him but he went off and he got alone with God and brother B said when he came back he was preaching the same thing they were [Applause] preaching you know as as Ministers of this gospel this end time message that God has called we we don't get on the phone all the time and and or emailing and texting and everything else trying to so what do you think about this what do you think about that hey what how are you looking at this right here and that I mean sure we like the fellowship and when we get together we'll we'll talk some things of what we're we're seeing and things and if we got a question we'll ask one another and that but we're not actually checking around all the churches to see hey look we all got to be on the same thing now here you know we we all got to be presenting this just right the same way here but when you go to look and if you know I don't actually do a lot of listening out in other places a little but I know and it's fine if you do but uh you know but when I do I see they're all preaching the same thing I'm preaching I have somebody I have a one of the ministers God called comes to the church and that begins to preach and the people are sitting there in the seron say we just heard Brother jury preach on these these say some these same things praise the Lord I've got people in my church you know that they there are certain ministers they like to listen to regularly as well you know and and that and and and and they'll come and they'll tell me hey you preach this and this and this brother Donnie's been covering services on it your brother's been preaching on this this one you know brother Tim puit or this one or that one or whoever you know and I like well see what it is we're not conferring with one another but we're all conferring with the same one Hallelujah because friends just as much as man can take the Bible and twisted there's been many preachers that's done that same thing with this end time message they'll take this quote and that quote and twist that's where all these doctrines that they ran off onto tangents over the years came from they they took certain quotes and ran off on things you you can look now here we stand uh 2024 look back at if any of you are aware look back at some of the doctrines that was going on during the 70s and 80s and you think man now that those are crazy God's got God took the prophet and now he's got seven men here and those seven men are the Thunders that God's going to use and you've got to be with these seven men to get the real re of this message and that that sounds insane today yeah but I'll tell you what back in the 70s there was people flock into that right right when when God begin to actually as a truth there at the beginning of the 80s God be you seen the real God called ministers to move and they begin to see look hey look the seventh seal was revealed right amen true and they begin to see look what brother Ram's Ministry was it was what was Luke 17 and 30 right when when it was the appearing of the son of man right brother brandham was preaching these things back in the 60s right amen and and even before and brother Bram you know but by the time it it came into the 60s brother Ram stood there and he was Sav now Luke 17:30 as it was in the days of lot so shall it be in the days when the son of man is being uh is being revealed and he and he said now and you know a lot of people focus on oh yeah lot and Sodom and all brother said no no here's what you need to focus on as the Believers there was one that stayed back there with Abraham that's right amen amen yeah he said there was two Messengers he said they went down there to get lot out of Sodom and brother benam the two modern day ministers he said that were going down to Sodom but he said now there was one that stayed back there with Abraham and he said he stood there with his back to the door of the tent and told the thoughts and intents of Sarah's heart and he said and we've been promised that again in this day amen and then he stood there finally one service had his back to the to the people and he be to call people out and in discernment tell them their names who they where they were from what sickness they had in that and then he turns back around fa the people and says is that not the same God that stood there with Abraham with his his back to the door of the [Applause] tent God promised to vindicate this and do this again he says and God's doing it again so you know we begin to see look the word has actually been opened amen it is important it look it was important in Paul's day to have for them to have a revelation that Paul was that messenger and that's why Paul begins to introduce this here that way uh talking speaking toward himself and the Vindication how God had Vindicated him and that he he speaks about that here in in the beginning of Galatians because it was important for the people to realize and have a revelation of who he was so that they could didn't have revelation to look at that God had gave him what he was saying so then they they could get a revelation that was the truth that it wasn't just some other man's ideology of it amen amen Paul says in 1 Corinthians 11 for this I have received of the Lord praise God thank you brother brandom referring to just that portion of Paul saying for this I've received the Lord then he says this what I just spoke to you about about Luke 17 and3 and he said the son of man is prophesied to be revealed he said and what kind of a revelation will it be it'll be a revelation of his living after being crucified for 1900 years and is raised from the dead and is alive with us he'll be revealed and he says look you don't need to interpret the word the word interprets Itself by bringing it to pass that's right and he says and it the word don't need any interpretation it's doing it itself revealing Christ in the promise of the age that's exactly what will come on the scene in this age sure sure and it did amen and when you get and it friends look there was there's many people that go around saying they believe brother brandom's a prophet but then when you begin to watch him you realize they're saying they believe it but evidently they don't got a revelation of it because how can you believe that brother Brandon was the prophet Messenger to the age but you believe in St at home listening to tapes CU that's not what the prophet [Music] preached how can you how can people claim they believe he's a prophet but then they they don't believe God really uses the five-fold ministry anymore brother venam never preached that look in the days when Jesus Christ came they were claiming Abraham as their father right the prophet Abraham's our Prophet we're his children Jesus said no you know if you were his children you'd do his works that's it if you believe the prophet Abraham you would do what the prophet Abraham said you would do his works and he said and and you seek to kill me he said this did not Abraham right so you know people saying I believe the prophet but friends they don't really walk according to what he preached look I've got folks that is around the area where I'm at that they believe it is good enough for them to just believe that brother brandham was a prophet and say well I love brother brandom that means I'm going to be there I've been there almost 26 years and some of them have never darkened the door once but they walk around saying they believe brother brandom was a prophet and they well I love brother brandom I'm going to be there because it said all that he ever loved and all that ever loved him is going to be there and friends and and there's a generation of people that the thing about it was that's what their mom and dads did their mom and dads never went to church claim to believe the message and they never went to church so so that was the example the children had but I can tell you this it wouldn't matter what the example was if there was a Le seed inside of an individual were there they would actually catch the truth irregardless of what Mom and Dad said because you you look at many of you here there's some of you sitting here today you're not following this message cuz Mommy and Daddy did some of your mommies and daddies they were they believed other things and we're other religions and I'm not trying to be disparaging or or down on them but I'm saying God revealed this to you you might have been raised in in some other Church some other denomination or or or or even by worldly people but here you stand believing the end time truth why because God revealed it to you friends and look it it wasn't just a revealing like as of understanding of knowledge right but there was something Supernatural that happened in your life TR friends I'll tell you this people talk about you know this preacher you know he he's made videos and said uh I I'm going to show you all these things that William brandham said that happened and that that never happened and and you can check all these things out and you be the judge and all that I don't even want to watch what the guy's got to say that's right why CU I'm going to tell you this friends something happened in me and it wasn't it wasn't because my mom and dad had tapes in the home I had to get the Revelation for myself I had to have a personal experience with Jesus Christ in my own heart and I'll tell you something friends I look at that and I'll and I've actually even told people years back I said look if my mom and dad and everybody I knew turned their backs and walked away from this it would not affect me a bit because I've got a personal revelation that this is the truth and I said and it's not a revelation of an standing or or boy I know a lot of great Mysteries something happened in me it changed my life and when I see this message and read the things and hear the things the prophet says I'm seeing my identification who I am hallelujah hallelujah the Bible said he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet right receiveth a prophet's reward right oh yeah I believe it you know I I had a lot of people talk to me there speculations on this and that but I'll tell you what I can just take you straight to what the prophet said in in the church age book brother mam said once prophets in the Land once more God will reveal the truth as he did to Paul in the days of the seventh messenger in the days of the lean Age The Messenger will reveal the mysteries of God as revealed to Paul he'll speak out and those who receive that prophet in his own name will receive the benefit effect of that prophet's Ministry and he said and they that hear him will be blessed and here's the benefit effect and become heart of the Bride in the last day that's mentioned in Revelations 22:17 the spirit and the bride say come Hallelujah brother Adam said look friends I'm going to tell you something I I look at these things that that Paul said and how he pointed his Vindication then I look at the Vindication that we look friends look I I don't get these people they that try to point at these things about well the bridge and all this and that and the other I'm going to tell you something friend I don't care what they say that all happened yeah the angels and and and and the cloud and all that all happened look Life Magazine didn't take a picture of an imagination right amen you know some sometimes you know uh like well coming up driving up here you know it got daylight when it got daylight we had our two our grandchildren with us and and one the rose was looking out the window and she saw this cloud and she said that cloud kind of exe resembles a certain certain kind of animal to me that wasn't what this was this wasn't somebody looking at a cloud and saying kind of think it looks like a turtle I kind of think it looks like a horse or I kind of think it looks like this brother R said take that cloud a picture of that cloud and he and turn it up on his side and it match the Hoffman head of Christ exactly Hallelujah people say oh brother Brandon wasn't caught up in that believe what you want you say how do you know you weren't there what what did you see you know how I know because friends it's been revealed to me that what God revealed to him when he was caught up by them seven angels is what it's been revealed to me through the word that he preached I don't just look at what he said in the message and say Okay I accept what he said I see what he said in the message in the word because that's what brother randam pointed to brother Ram look friends this end time message it was not of men neither was it by manall this the the re revelation of the seals remember brother brandom he would talk about he he was actually he did look at what some other preachers and different men had said about this and that and he said and many of them he said said about that first horse rider they said oh that was Christ cuz it you know was on a white horse and all this and that and brother Ram said you know he was looking at those things and then the Lord revealed to him no no that wasn't that was the Antichrist he had a bow and no arrows amen amen and was white because it was an innocent looking Doctrine at the time right right amen but then look down through all those four horse riders and see how it progressed because it was the same horse rider it was just as it changed colors it was because it was representing how that was progressing amen hallelujah yes sir praise God hallelujah and look friends this isn't look there are people that have uh that follow certain religions in the world and they follow some some of them have men that they claim to be their prophet of their religion right right and and they follow them but you know many of them it has been pointed out uh some of the the actually uh very ungodly things in the ways that they lived right you know and uh but I'm going to tell you this friends God Vindicated this end time prophet and you're not going to find in any type of uh filth and dirt and ungodly things that's right remember the the angel spoke to him and said don't ever drink smoke or defile your body in any way that's right but God didn't just after God had that spoke to brother brandom he didn't just leave that in brother bram's hands and leave it up to him every time that the Flesh of William brandham would go to look at his life story and everything said he his daddy would call him a and everything else he'd say give me that bottle and he'd go to take a drink and here it come that Whirlwind come boy that that wind come and he would drop it and go of crying right God was protecting that why because God was going to be bringing the end time truth bringing the the the Mysteries that were hidden and the actual uh truth that actually had been lost during the Dark Ages the truth of the godhead friends look we know Martin Luther you know he he took the first step stepping away from the the the Catholic church and that but Martin Luther was still the trinitarian god hadn't revealed that yet God promised a prophet in this end time that would be the voice that when that voice begin to sound all the mysteries of God that had been hidden would be revealed Hallelujah we we've got some people claim to be message Believers stumbling around some of them they don't believe the seventh seal was open right right that's true and they go and they read the seal book and they listen to the tape and they say well look what he says right there it wasn't open well look at everything he said right there look what he says right there at the end of he goes perhaps I've said too much Satan can't know what this is if he does he'll do great damage then you don't even got to go listen to him just go read the titles of the messages begin to be preached by the prophet from that time on read the titles Rapture Christ the mystery that God revealed future home my it just goes on and on on what was it friends look I'm going to tell you something the seven seal wasn't just a happening the seven seal was a person that's good it was Christ that that that Lamb of God that actually had the book that was worthy to have the book and worthy to loose the seals that came every night and opened each seal [Music] hallu there's been many people I can remember when I was a little boy I was sitting we had a we had service and and this has nothing to do with that church or any of the Brethren don't take it that way but because this was back in the the early 70s and and that and so uh we we' had church that morning there was a visiting Ministry in we had a dinner and we went to the the dinner you know and and uh the the brothers were still there and and there was preachers all sitting at this table fellowshipping and uh and and I guess maybe all the the other children had already left you know maybe they went to go get ready for the service or whatever that we was going to have for that night and so but there was no other kids there so uh I went over sit down at the table with the preachers and I just sit on the end you know but I was taught right I kept my mouth shut and just listen now you know I told my mom about this reason I said there was a lot of things they were saying that I didn't understand the words they were saying at the time and because they were talking about the third pool and I thought they were saying p l not p l and so I was like I don't know what these swimming pools are going to be you know but I listened anyway but the thing about it was friends this is what I did pick up all them sitting there talking they didn't know what the third pool was either they were all speculating you think it could be this and you think it could be that and well speak limbs into existence and and these different things like that but now you know and it was there all the time amen but now we look and all of a sudden we're seeing it's been brought out by the five4 ministry that's been brought out over o over this you know these I don't know recent 40 years or so and they're saying look brother ROM said the third pull was the opening of the seals yes amen it was the opening of the [Applause] [Music] word and now of course he talks about the manifestations of the third pool and all this but brother benam he he said look this was the opening of the word it was the revealing of the seals Hallelujah it just came a season for God to to begin to inspire that to to the elect his elect his bride in this day and say hey look this is what it is looking Hallelujah friends look you say brother Jerry how you talked about that has been revealed to you I'll tell you what happened friends the third pull worked in me I had a third pool work that worked in here it was the same thing that happened to that little fish it was the same thing that brought that squirrel squirrels into existence it was the same thing that spoke to the storm and told to go back where it came from what was it it was a work of God it was a new life it was a new creation in my life it was a resurrection that took place in my soul just like it did in that little fish sir am sir friends those things are great but I'm telling you I and you are a manifestation today of the third pool Hallelujah amen amen that's why nothing of these other people got to say and everything's ever going to sway me that's right that's the truth hallelujah praise the lord it's been revealed to me brother brandom didn't get this from some man it was revealed to him by God Amen right God caught him up those Angels Came caught him up the Lamb of God came and revealed those seals there amen there's one man that uh that you know a preacher that turned his back on this message and walk away I happened to know his daddy his daddy had been in brother Bam's meetings and all that and I I talked to another man that that is about my age that was actually close with this elderly man and he asked this elderly man he said look during your time he said you saw this great evangelist and you saw that great evangelist you saw this man saying he was a Healer you saw that one saying he was healer he says and you was in brother branham's meetings he says he say what was different about it to you and this this brother whose son turned around and left the message later this brother said because he never missed right that's right every time he said thus sayith the Lord it happened exactly hallu Hallelujah he said you're I was in all these other meetings of all these other so-called great men and that he said but I want to tell you what the difference was I'll tell you what it was never a man spake like this man hallelujah praise the Lord you know brother Brandon he would he would make statements at different times saying you know I'm really not a great speaker you know and he says you know I'm not I I'm not real organized with with by speaking I'm not really educated and he says some of these preachers here they're much better preachers than me right friends look God wasn't sending us a a grand uh I don't even know the word to use other than speaker you know somebody that very good auditory and all that whatever and that that wasn't what God was sending us it wasn't the voice of the man it was the voice behind the voice that was the voice we're hearing that's the voice we're still hearing today that is still the voice that speaking through God's called fivefold Ministry of this end time truth today it's still the same voice hallelujah hallelujah that's right remember the Bible says in the Book of Revelations it said the voice singular of many Waters so it's it's many preaches within this five-fold ministry but it's the same voice and because it's the same voice then you can see when brother Brandon points this out in Revelations where it says the spirit says come and the bride says come he said in the last day he said the prophet and the spirit and the bride will be saying the same thing he says and what they say will have already been said hallelujah hallelujah who is the final voice to the final age yeah like I said there's a singular voice it's Christ but who is who is God using in this final the final time in this final leads the final voice is bride that's righten yeah all right the seventh seal look at Christ The Mystery of God revealed brother Ram said God had a threefold purpose he said his first purpose was he wanted to reveal himself to his people and he said he couldn't reveal himself that way as the great Jehovah God that that uh uh uh occupied all time space and Eternity said but he actually wanted to come down he said and identify himself with man in flesh he said he wanted to uh to identify himself with human beings right so he came down and became one of us so he says the first fold of that three-fold purpose was God coming down and revealing himself in Christ hallah thank you God Jesus said I'll not leave you comfortless he said I go I go to the father but I I I'll send the comforter to you and he said I'll come again go Terry in Jerusalem until you're in Du with power from on high brother said the second purpose of his three-fold purpose he says was to have the preeminence in his church his body the bride the Believers he said the second one was to come and live not just in Christ in flesh but to live in his people hallu then he says the third purpose of the threefold purpose of God he says is to restore the kingdom Hallelujah friends look I'm part of that third or that that that second part that's happened in me that's happened in you Christ is living in meise the Lord look I don't care what anybody else believes there's nothing they got to say that's going to change what happened in me I think about what Paul said I didn't get this from man neither was it by man amen and I think of that little saying the world didn't give it to me and the world can't take it away these the these carnal intellectual believers they didn't give me this Revelation and they can't take it away hallelujah praise be to God hallelujah and I believe God's having his preeminence in his Believers and I'll tell you something friends when I look around and I see all these things happening like I've told you around the end time truth and all that friends you know that just that lets me know Lord I I'm seeing that's fulfillment from the scripture that's right so it lets me know how close we are to the Fulfillment of the promise that actually speaks of us the Believers not just people that are still alive but the Bible says alive and remain amen you say what do you mean by that well Jesus said only those that endure to the end friends we're we're enduring to the end hallelujah praise God we're not being swayed by any of these things hallelujah amen look I I could go over and I could I could show you how that the bridge happened I could show you how all these other things happened and all that but the thing about it is friends you know you know I actually took a service back when uh the was somebody that had come out and they were talking about this whole thing about the bridge and I took a service at home and I actually uh played some some uh audio on on our our system of of people that were interviewed back during the time when brother brandham was here uh there was a man there in Jeffersonville that that they interviewed him and and he was talking about his family and his grandmother talking about she saw that happen with that bridge and those men die in that y you know and the man said look you wonder why they didn't get put in the news and everything else he said those companies and different things he want that in there look at our news media today you can't trust it today why do you think you could have better trusted it all back then all the time hallelujah praise the Lord friends look I'll tell you we're at the threshold of the the restoration of the Kingdom we're at the threshold of the Fulfillment of the third fold purpose of God restoring of the Kingdom hallelujah hallu hallelujah oh my there's so much I can say about that there's so much friends that the restoring of the Kingdom we have such a part in that amen our body changes part of that Hallelujah the Rapture the marriage supp of the Lamb all that is part of that the Millennium it's all part of that the the time of the Judgment that's yet to come that's all part of that hallelujah we're at the threshold today we are hallelujah hallelujah now is not the time look friends how does the scripture say that once you put your hand to the plow don't look back now ain't the time to look back amen hallelujah let's stand hallelujah hallelujah Heavenly Father
