[37:07] Father I know I don't have to look
[37:09] beyond my own
[37:12] life what looked like to be impossible
[37:15] and what
[37:16] was things that uh others could look at
[37:19] and say well Sam because that's what
[37:22] they they knew me as
[37:25] oh this is just a time this is just just
[37:27] a season but you know when you meet God
[37:32] face to face it was no longer just a
[37:37] season right it changed amen the desires
[37:42] the nature on the inside
[37:45] changed once we meet God fully in that
[37:48] way just full surrender just fully
[37:51] surrendering then he fully comes in and
[37:55] there's a difference it's not us making
[37:57] a difference it's god making a
[37:58] difference and I'll just say it like
[38:00] this that I can just remember when I
[38:02] looked at my life and I thought my all
[38:06] the times that I tried all the times
[38:08] that I failed and that was standing
[38:10] right before me but I'm so thankful that
[38:14] in that moment God's grace swept down
[38:17] and it's to accept what he did it's to
[38:21] accept what he did at Calvary and that
[38:25] Calvary calvary's not a stop stopping
[38:27] point Calvary is a way that's been
[38:30] opened that we can
[38:33] walk into that place with him where we
[38:36] could not get to God God came to where
[38:42] we were yeah and he he made a way as
[38:46] Paul said in the book of Hebrews he he
[38:48] made a way and Calvary made a way oh my
[38:51] I'm so thankful for Calvary aren't you
[38:55] amen Calvary made a way for us for us to
[38:57] have our Calvary our death to self a
[39:01] real dying that Christ might be born in
[39:05] our lives amen don't you love him
[39:07] tonight my it's just such a joy to serve
[39:09] him a't it amen God bless you amen it's

[39:44] it's good to have Colton here with us
[39:46] and honestly I don't know how I forgot
[39:47] his name because I Call On Him enough in

[39:51] meetings and so so good to have each of
[39:53] you here amen so good to be in the house
[39:56] of the Lord in it amen I know um we're

[40:02] you hadn't heard the news uh we brother
[40:05] joshu and sister Sharon they welcome
[40:08] their little boy little Stephen and so
[40:11] we're thankful for
[40:13] that and uh just want to ask you just to
[40:18] continue to keep them in prayer they're
[40:19] doing well uh they're doing very well
[40:23] so really keep them in prayer also I
[40:26] think the prayer request that was uh
[40:28] made mention here regarding uh sister
[40:31] Carmen sister Irma's Father which would
[40:33] be brother Carlos's father-in-law um
[40:37] he's in the hospital he's not doing well
[40:40] and um he needs a real touch from the
[40:43] Lord uh I was asking Brother Carlos you
[40:46] know uh where everything stands as far
[40:49] as even when in his life and he said
[40:51] he's he's given his life to the Lord and
[40:53] so we are thankful for that and um
[40:57] they've given right now he just had got
[40:59] a call and that's probably why he's not
[41:00] here he just had got a call they've only
[41:02] given him uh 24 hours now the thing of
[41:05] it is is that that's all the doctors
[41:07] know and so we just want to be in prayer
[41:11] and we know that nothing's impossible
[41:13] with the
[41:14] Lord remember like we preached on Sunday
[41:17] where it looks like there's no hope
[41:20] that's when God steps
[41:25] in God all the way through the script
[41:27] scriptures all the way through the
[41:28] scriptures God is one who comes and
[41:31] breathes hope into these situ an
[41:34] expectation why because of God because
[41:37] of him amen let's just let's go before

[44:56] father we pray
[44:57] in Jesus
[44:59] name amen and amen amen God bless you
[45:04] thank you
[45:05] musicians if you would turn in your
[45:07] Bibles with me I'm going to just
[45:11] read a verse of scripture here and then
[45:15] we'll allow you to be
[45:18] seated and I want to the Lord will help
[45:21] us tonight I'd like to speak to you on a
[45:25] thought we've been dealing with this on
[45:27] the on the mind and you know we were
[45:30] looking at that part in in job where
[45:34] Satan was really U making job think that
[45:38] it was God who was putting all of this
[45:41] on him it was God that was doing it and
[45:45] yet it was really only God permitting it
[45:49] but it was Satan doing it numbers of a
[45:51] lot of scriptures where job speaks of
[45:54] what he's actually uh believing at that
[45:58] moment but remember the prophet said as
[46:00] long as job as he could make job think
[46:04] that way he had him whipped yeah and so
[46:08] when we're looking at this we understand
[46:10] that remember Peter would take and write
[46:12] in the scriptures very familiar
[46:14] scriptures as Believers uh we take these
[46:17] scriptures and we are strengthened and
[46:19] encouraged when we go through tests and
[46:21] trials and frankly with tests and trials
[46:23] you're either in one coming out of one
[46:26] or heading into one it's it's one or the
[46:28] other because this is part of our
[46:30] molding grounds while we're here and uh
[46:34] I don't mean to be the the trumpeter of
[46:35] good news or bad news but but it's it's
[46:38] true those are the molding places that
[46:40] God permits to take our way and this is
[46:42] why that Peter would write beloved think
[46:46] it not strange when that fiery trial has
[46:49] come to try because sometimes we think
[46:52] my you know it seems like you're
[46:53] blindsided where did this come from and
[46:55] where where did this but remember the
[46:57] prophet also told us in Victory Day He
[46:59] said when God gives you a trial that's
[47:02] showing he's got confidence in you so
[47:04] good you know we we many times put the
[47:07] confidence out here in well if God
[47:09] allowed me to walk on water and if God
[47:11] allowed me to pray for the sick and all
[47:13] those things have their part and they
[47:14] have their place but when God permits a
[47:16] trial to come your way that's God's sign
[47:19] of
[47:21] confidence oh my see if we can just Lord
[47:24] let that just let it drop down to the
[47:26] fifth rib but I I mean just Let It Drop
[47:29] there you know amen let's read this
[47:31] first verse of scripture 1 Peter chap
[47:34] 1:13 Peter said wherefore gird up the
[47:39] loins of your
[47:41] mind I'm sorry I didn't give you a
[47:43] chance to turn to
[47:45] it two services in a row bad
[47:49] habit wherefore gird up the loins of
[47:53] your mind now notice this is not
[47:55] something that God's going to do do for
[47:57] us but we have access and God equips us
[48:01] to be able to G our minds with the right
[48:03] things wherefore gird up the loins of
[48:06] your mind be sober and hope to the end
[48:10] for the grace that is to be brought unto
[48:13] you at the revelation of Jesus Christ
[48:16] amen may God bless you and bless the
[48:18] reading of the word as you're being
[48:20] seated I'd like to just speak here for a
[48:22] few moments on overcoming in the
[48:25] Battlefield of the Mind
[48:27] overcoming in the Battlefield of the
[48:29] Mind I certainly believe that we're
[48:31] we're Overcomers we're not survivors but
[48:35] we are called to be Overcomers and in
[48:38] order to be an overcomer we've got to be
[48:40] have battles that are faced that we Face
[48:43] things that are before us it's kind of
[48:45] like a testimony you can't have a
[48:48] testimony unless there's been a battle
[48:51] but you know a testimony itself is that
[48:54] result of of a battle that is taken
[48:57] place and a victory that has been won
[49:00] and notice how that Peter would write of
[49:02] this and this phrase you find it
[49:05] throughout the scriptures of giring up
[49:08] thy loins and Peter would write of it in
[49:10] terms of the mind and the whole point
[49:14] within this is when we and ourselves our
[49:18] mind we you know we' have to go back and
[49:21] to think of how that the the Bible is
[49:23] written it's an Eastern book and it's
[49:25] written in this term where you'll find
[49:27] gird up the loins you'll find that
[49:29] giring because they wore they wore the
[49:32] long garment and that long garment was
[49:36] it had to be where they would take the
[49:38] Garment there from the back and the the
[49:39] men they would take it and they had a
[49:41] belt or a GLE here and they would pull
[49:44] that up that that part they would pull
[49:46] from behind and so that it would their
[49:49] way would not be impeded or hindered in
[49:52] order to be ready to move it was a place
[49:56] to where they can actually you're in a
[49:57] place of of strength because uh of where
[50:01] that the source of strength you know how
[50:03] it is even in your uh with your hips and
[50:06] things like that there's so many things
[50:07] that you and I we depend on with our
[50:10] hips and you sometimes you don't think
[50:12] of it after so long of a time but if you
[50:14] start getting a little trouble in your
[50:16] hips or something but that's a real
[50:17] source of strength that is there within
[50:21] even in your body and how that they
[50:23] would be admonished to take this like
[50:25] when in AA would tell Gesa take my staff
[50:29] G thyself and run and take the staff to
[50:32] the baby you would find that each one of
[50:35] these times it was to remove any
[50:38] hindrances that would be in the way
[50:40] remember when they were to eat the the
[50:42] Passover there in the in Exodus 12 it
[50:45] said they were to eat it with their feet
[50:47] shoden with a staff in the hand and with
[50:51] themselves being girded ready to go at a
[50:54] moment's notice and you know in this
[50:56] time and an hour we're living in the
[50:59] scripture would speak of it in Ephesians
[51:02] 6:14 just one part there of our armor it
[51:05] would tell us how to stand with this
[51:08] armor on having your loins gir about
[51:11] with truth so this is this is the giring
[51:15] that we we want we want our loins gird
[51:18] about with truth this is a place to
[51:20] where that if you can think of it in
[51:21] this way that that first every thought
[51:25] itself it can be in like a seed I I
[51:28] don't know about you but there's there's
[51:29] places that even when I look around my
[51:32] flower bed there at the house there's
[51:34] areas where I have had to deal with
[51:36] certain weeds and I don't know where
[51:37] they come from I honestly I didn't plant
[51:40] those weeds there but there's other
[51:42] parts of the house I never have to worry
[51:44] about those weeds but it's in certain
[51:46] areas you know and then and then there's
[51:48] times where you have what always Marvels
[51:50] me and and just please bear with me a
[51:52] moment on this what always Marvels me is
[51:55] how that that they're they're can be a
[51:57] weed that's growing and it will actually
[51:59] be a weed that when its leaves actually
[52:02] look like the plant that it's growing in
[52:05] I've marveled at that how that we have a
[52:07] weed and it's growing right in the midst
[52:09] of a hydran I have to look I'm looking
[52:11] at that leaf and I'm saying that doesn't
[52:13] that that doesn't look like the rest of
[52:14] the leaves but you know just in passing
[52:16] they don't catch it sometimes it's went
[52:19] for a period of time and finally I'm
[52:20] pulling that weed up and it's went like
[52:22] this it's this tall it's but it's
[52:24] something because you don't notice it
[52:26] because of how that it Blends in if it
[52:28] was something so obvious and there are
[52:31] weeds that are very obvious but you see
[52:33] Satan doesn't come to attack us on the
[52:36] obvious things Satan wants to just
[52:39] sometimes just have a little seed all it
[52:41] can take is it can be blown through in
[52:44] the wind and then we take that seed and
[52:46] if you begin to take that seed in and
[52:49] just to dwell on that seed it begins to
[52:52] give it the nourishment that's needed
[52:54] and you'll find it begins to affect even
[52:57] the way that you will look at things and
[53:00] the way that even that you will conduct
[53:04] yourself just stay with me here this is
[53:06] why that even when you think about let
[53:09] me just let me just stop here for a
[53:10] moment when you think of it in this time
[53:13] remember when the prophet was standing
[53:15] right up there and here was his little
[53:17] little baby and here she was she she was
[53:21] she was passing and and there you know
[53:24] there was his wife you know and where
[53:25] she had passed remember brother Bram
[53:27] tells this and he tells in a few places
[53:29] especially in 1965 and I want you to
[53:32] listen very carefully he says here I was
[53:35] standing there and Satan he said about
[53:37] that time came right up next to me and
[53:40] he said huh and that's how he's going to
[53:44] do
[53:46] you look what you've done when you came
[53:49] in you Ste you slept in your work
[53:51] clothes in the chair you went and prayed
[53:53] for the sick and he said uh you know
[53:56] know and how they were healed God healed
[53:58] them and he began to go through a whole
[54:00] list of things and this is what I want
[54:01] you to catch the prophet said everything
[54:05] that he was saying was
[54:08] true you see where that's at the Gate of
[54:11] reasoning reasoning is a gate of
[54:14] judgment are you with me yeah see Satan
[54:17] see listen even within things within
[54:19] even how that comes remember how Nathan
[54:22] remember when David was in his wrong in
[54:25] his error Nathan never just bust in the
[54:27] door and said hey you were with basba he
[54:30] didn't do that you know what he did he
[54:33] came in that service he took his text
[54:37] and he began to stir up that gate of
[54:39] judgment and he got it to a place to
[54:41] where when David said that man is
[54:45] guilty finally Nathan stepped back and
[54:47] said you're the man see what happened
[54:50] the the gate came
[54:52] open God even says in his word come let
[54:55] us reason together reasoning is fine as
[54:58] long as it's with God's word but once it
[55:02] is against the word of God we turn it
[55:06] down God's word is above every other
[55:08] word heavens and earth will pass away
[55:11] but my word shall never pass away let
[55:14] God's word be truth and every man's word
[55:17] be a lie so if there's anything that
[55:20] comes in your mind that wants to exalt
[55:23] itself above the word of God cast it
[55:26] down I don't care if he's coming and
[55:28] he's wanting to point out your faults
[55:30] you hang to the word of God and you
[55:33] stand upon the word because as a
[55:36] Believer you've got grounds to stand on
[55:39] yes sir Hallelujah I just read here here
[55:44] just just here the other day brother BR
[55:46] was talking in the message having
[55:48] conferences he said there was a man he
[55:50] said here he what he said he would get
[55:51] saved and he said all of a sudden he
[55:53] said he get out here he said the devil
[55:55] start working on his mind and he said
[55:57] and he said he would go back and forth
[55:59] with the devil well I know I'm saved and
[56:01] and I know that and he said finally he
[56:03] said that old man he said he got tired
[56:05] of all that and he said I'm going to
[56:06] tell you what I'm going to do he said
[56:08] I'm going to get an old knob and I'm
[56:10] going to drill it right here in the
[56:13] ground because I have met God's
[56:15] requirements I am saved and anytime
[56:18] devil this is what he said anytime devil
[56:21] you ever come back to me and say that
[56:23] I'm not saved I'm going to point you to
[56:25] this knob in the ground when you tell me
[56:28] the Holy Ghost is not for me I'm going
[56:30] to point you to this knob in the ground
[56:33] when you tell me healing is not for me
[56:35] I'm going to point you to this knob in
[56:36] the ground let me tell you something God
[56:39] gives you a place where you can point to
[56:41] his grace touching your
[56:43] life and you operate from that Grace
[56:46] where God has begin to deal with your
[56:48] life and you know what it does it
[56:50] doesn't get weaker it only gets stronger
[56:53] you know why you're feeding your
[56:54] experience
[56:56] Lord
[56:59] hallelujah having our loins G about with
[57:02] truth remember brother brah said
[57:03] everything he was saying was the truth
[57:06] and finally brother Braham said it like
[57:08] this I want you to think of this these
[57:11] words had come in through the gate of
[57:14] reasoning and it come down through there
[57:17] and the prophet said I was about ready
[57:19] to say if that's how he's going to
[57:23] be you see it was made it in the mind
[57:27] had come into the Mind here and where
[57:30] that here in the gates of reasoning but
[57:32] he said there was something that rose up
[57:35] from the inside and said though he slay
[57:38] me yet I'll serve him and that wasn't
[57:41] that wasn't brother brandom as far as to
[57:44] point him to him and his strength his
[57:46] strength Came From Within when he was at
[57:49] a point of of breaking yet the word you
[57:53] cannot deceive the word
[57:56] the word spoke in that moment this is
[57:59] why David could say in Psalms 27 the
[58:02] Lord is the strength of my life I don't
[58:06] have to ask you but there's all through
[58:08] here that there's times that you have
[58:10] felt like uh you just felt like what's
[58:12] the use and and just giving in but there
[58:14] is a strength that keeps pressing you
[58:18] onward that's strength is not you I
[58:21] don't care how Resolute you are as a
[58:23] family you have no glory in this at all
[58:26] it is God's glory in your
[58:29] life it's God who gives us the courage
[58:32] to press
[58:36] on Hallelujah notice in this time in
[58:40] this day like the prophet would say it
[58:42] in this way and I just want to refer to
[58:44] a few of these places before I go
[58:46] further in diving into this but just
[58:48] just to listen here just for a moment I
[58:51] I don't have these up there I want you
[58:52] just to listen to them brother BR said
[58:54] in a day brother when there's all kinds
[58:56] of isms and fanaticism it's time to G
[58:59] yourself with the truth and Jesus said I
[59:02] am the truth and it says you got to know
[59:05] where you're standing and you have to
[59:08] know as you know where you're standing
[59:10] you've got the whole armor buckled on
[59:13] it's gir about buckled down good and
[59:15] tight and pulled down with the truth of
[59:18] God's word anchored in your heart all
[59:22] devils in hell can't upset you then
[59:25] you're able to go meet Satan and say
[59:27] it's written and Satan can say oh did
[59:30] you take up servants no sir but I
[59:31] believe Jesus Christ uh did you do this
[59:34] stand no sir but I received the baptism
[59:36] of the Holy Ghost Buckle it about and
[59:39] GED with truth oh that's in Redemption
[59:42] by power brother Bram said that big belt
[59:44] and and you know I don't have a picture
[59:46] of the Armament here but it's a big belt
[59:48] that will hold everything together if
[59:51] that belt gets loose then everything can
[59:54] start sagging on that armor
[59:56] but the belt's got to stay tightened up
[59:59] are you hearing me it's got to stay
[1:00:01] tightened up and sometimes the belt gets
[1:00:03] loose and you got to reach down and
[1:00:06] tighten
[1:00:06] up that right watch this brother Bram is
[1:00:10] talking about and he says you notice
[1:00:11] when you begin to feel like you're
[1:00:13] slacking or the devil says it's no use
[1:00:16] reach down and tighten up the belt a
[1:00:19] little bit pull up the sword a little
[1:00:21] tighter in the hand and go forward like
[1:00:24] that be ready for the March so you know
[1:00:28] there's times when we're going to feel
[1:00:30] like we're slacking and the devil says
[1:00:32] it's no use that's the time to reach
[1:00:36] down and tighten up the
[1:00:39] Buckle that's the time now listen we got
[1:00:42] all we got a lot of things all around us
[1:00:45] we got a lot of things that would like
[1:00:46] to try to fill our mind but let me just
[1:00:50] say this to you it is your
[1:00:52] responsibility and my responsibility as
[1:00:55] what we feel and place in our
[1:00:59] minds now watch this in the scripture we
[1:01:02] read for our text wherefore G up the
[1:01:04] loins of your mind and be sober and hope
[1:01:08] to the end for the grace that is to be
[1:01:09] brought unto you at the revelation of
[1:01:12] Jesus Christ now you know that before
[1:01:14] there can ever be any battle that's
[1:01:16] actually put in Array we want to talk
[1:01:18] about this Battleground a moment this
[1:01:21] battleground of where actually forces
[1:01:23] will meet one another is what they call
[1:01:26] No Man's Land and greatest battle ever
[1:01:28] fought brother B says there has to be a
[1:01:30] place selected there's a mutual ground a
[1:01:34] no man's land that they fight here at
[1:01:37] this place they they just don't one
[1:01:39] fight over here and one down here and
[1:01:41] one run over there there's a Battlefront
[1:01:43] where they meet and test their powers
[1:01:46] and where each Army tests its strength
[1:01:48] against the other Army and mutual
[1:01:50] meeting place now he says when the great
[1:01:53] battle started on Earth there had to be
[1:01:55] a mutual meeting place there had to be a
[1:01:59] place selected for the battle to begin
[1:02:02] and for the battle to rage and that
[1:02:05] Battlegrounds begin in the human mind
[1:02:08] there is where the battle starts the
[1:02:11] human mind was chosen for the place of
[1:02:13] the battle where it was begin and that
[1:02:16] is because that decisions are made from
[1:02:20] the mind and from the
[1:02:22] head it's a Battleground now watch this
[1:02:25] he says the Battlegrounds where you've
[1:02:27] got to meet your enemy is in the mind
[1:02:29] you've got to make your choice it meets
[1:02:34] you in paragraph 70 he said decisions
[1:02:37] are made in the mind the head there is
[1:02:40] where Satan meets you and the decisions
[1:02:43] are because that God made a man that
[1:02:48] way see there's a way God God made us
[1:02:52] that way remember when he when when when
[1:02:54] he came when Gabriel
[1:02:56] came with that announcement to Mary the
[1:02:59] Bible said she cast in her mind what
[1:03:02] manner of saying this was and remember
[1:03:04] the first thing that that remember the
[1:03:06] angel Discerning that and it begins to
[1:03:09] point her to the scriptures to do what
[1:03:12] he begins to settle her mind praise God
[1:03:16] are you hearing me now because you see
[1:03:18] what happened when he points to settle
[1:03:20] her mind it brings her to a place to
[1:03:22] where she's now opening to the word
[1:03:25] that's coming to her it's not that she
[1:03:28] didn't believe Isaiah 9:6 Isaiah 7:14
[1:03:32] she did but you see when the word itself
[1:03:35] was beginning to point and say you are
[1:03:38] what the word was talking about then in
[1:03:42] her mind she's Tre troubled what's going
[1:03:44] on here but the word listen this is the
[1:03:47] power of the word it comes to change the
[1:03:50] atmosphere it comes to change the
[1:03:53] situation it is the spirit of God just
[1:03:56] like Genesis 1 he brewed over the Earth
[1:03:59] to change the
[1:04:02] conditions thank when Satan came to Eve
[1:04:05] what did he have to do first get her to
[1:04:07] open her
[1:04:08] mind before the ACT took place it had to
[1:04:12] be received in the
[1:04:14] mind oh my this is why even with we talk
[1:04:18] of the new birth the new birth is not
[1:04:20] bypassing the mind but it's receiving
[1:04:23] the word in our mind and we're receiving
[1:04:27] that word that has the authority and The
[1:04:29] Power Within it to drop down and change
[1:04:33] our lives completely it's a bomb when it
[1:04:36] drops down it'll clear everything out
[1:04:39] when we can just say Lord be it unto me
[1:04:42] oh Lord I give my life to you Lord take
[1:04:44] anything out Lord that's unlike you I
[1:04:46] just want to serve you Lord with all my
[1:04:49] heart with all my life Lord cutting
[1:04:51] everything out Lord and the word will do
[1:04:56] that 1 Peter 4:1 for then for as much
[1:04:59] then as Christ ha suffered for us in the
[1:05:02] flesh arm yourselves likewise with the
[1:05:06] same mind for he that hath suffered In
[1:05:09] the Flesh hath ceased from sin then he
[1:05:12] no longer should live the rest of his
[1:05:14] time in the flesh to the lust of men but
[1:05:18] to the will of God Amen so the mind that
[1:05:21] we that Peter is writing of here is
[1:05:23] talking about the mind of Christ talking
[1:05:26] about God's own life this is how this is
[1:05:29] how we fight our battles this is how
[1:05:32] that we approach everything let it be
[1:05:34] passed through the mind of Christ we
[1:05:36] want to arm ourselves with that mind arm
[1:05:39] ourselves with that life that word in
[1:05:42] our life that's what we want we don't
[1:05:44] want it just in our knowledge we want it
[1:05:46] in the midst of our life where we're
[1:05:48] living from that realm and listen
[1:05:51] friends there's things that we come to
[1:05:53] that we maybe don't have exact ly the
[1:05:56] answer to situations can come and they
[1:05:59] can take us by surprise but let me just
[1:06:01] tell you there's nothing that takes God
[1:06:03] by surprise but it's up to you and I to
[1:06:07] bring every thought in subjection to The
[1:06:10] Obedience of Christ and give no way
[1:06:14] allow the devil to give no excuse no
[1:06:17] reason of why that this could be
[1:06:19] remember we are sheep you've got rights
[1:06:21] but if you're a sheep you'll forfeit
[1:06:23] your rights right we've got rights to a
[1:06:26] lot of things but remember when we as
[1:06:29] Lambs we are willing to lay our rights
[1:06:32] down for
[1:06:35] him brother BR says in Satan's Eden he
[1:06:37] said I want to speak to you on something
[1:06:39] or bring something to Enlighten you to
[1:06:41] the promise of God for this age he said
[1:06:43] something not something that somebody
[1:06:45] else was in some other day but them
[1:06:47] things are all right but we all refer to
[1:06:49] those things but I thought I would try
[1:06:51] to bring something to your mind with the
[1:06:53] scriptures that's written here that
[1:06:55] would en lighten you to know make you a
[1:06:57] better soldier in the field that you're
[1:07:00] fighting in now to learn the tactics of
[1:07:03] the enemy so that you can block
[1:07:05] everything before it gets to you did you
[1:07:07] catch that block it before it gets to
[1:07:10] you so it's coming at you but you want
[1:07:13] to be able to block it well how do you
[1:07:16] block it you block it with a word when a
[1:07:19] man is going to fight he wants a
[1:07:21] sparring partner that is going to fight
[1:07:23] like the man he's going to fight
[1:07:27] and so this is why God lays his word in
[1:07:30] sometimes we can set right here are you
[1:07:31] hearing me now we can set right here and
[1:07:34] we can think my you know that's
[1:07:35] wonderful and that's tremendous and
[1:07:37] sometimes we can look and you know but
[1:07:39] God's what God's wanting to do is that
[1:07:41] word to come down in our life and come
[1:07:44] to a place of application because
[1:07:47] there's going to be situations that come
[1:07:50] that that cause us to come to a place of
[1:07:53] applying the word of God in our
[1:07:58] lives it comes to that the word must be
[1:08:01] applied the word was meant to be live
[1:08:04] now so we want to keep those punches off
[1:08:07] of us we want to learn the tactics of
[1:08:09] the enemy he says that's the main thing
[1:08:11] is to learn to keep the punches off of
[1:08:14] you as much as you can amen so if he
[1:08:19] wants to that yeah a punch is going to
[1:08:21] come as far as to connect with you but
[1:08:24] you've got to have something in there
[1:08:26] where there's a strength to get back up
[1:08:29] it's a strength to keep on to keep
[1:08:31] pressing on but the main thing is is
[1:08:33] steady to keep the punches off of
[1:08:37] us now watch this when we think of it
[1:08:40] when you think of this message that
[1:08:41] brother BR preaches in Satan's Eden he
[1:08:43] deals with the reasonings and how that
[1:08:46] you know intellectual gospel where you
[1:08:49] know he says how that you know how he
[1:08:51] talks about how that a man you know had
[1:08:53] had a particular um aori him before him
[1:08:56] and the man he said when his crowd came
[1:08:58] out he said that man's crowd he said oh
[1:09:00] my they were you know just dressed to
[1:09:02] the nines and my just intellectual just
[1:09:06] I mean great you know theologians and
[1:09:08] things and he said when my crowd begin
[1:09:10] to come in of where the those who were
[1:09:12] coming to the meetings where brother
[1:09:13] Brandon was ministering he said you had
[1:09:15] people on Cs and stretchers and you know
[1:09:18] they didn't look like much or anything
[1:09:20] else he said they came and they sat down
[1:09:22] and he said but God be to move on the
[1:09:24] scene and to touch lives and heal lives
[1:09:28] begin to restore you see you see what
[1:09:30] the difference is the word was meant to
[1:09:33] minister to every part of man this word
[1:09:36] never came to massage our mind it never
[1:09:40] came to uplift an ego but the word of
[1:09:43] God itself came to uplift that part that
[1:09:46] God knew before the foundation of the
[1:09:49] world that you and I were Sons and
[1:09:51] Daughters of God you and I may not have
[1:09:53] ever come in in a wheelchair in our CAU
[1:09:55] but spiritually we were bound we were
[1:09:57] wrecks we were miserable we needed a
[1:10:00] living God we needed something more than
[1:10:03] just religion we needed something more
[1:10:05] than church we needed the Lord Jesus
[1:10:09] Christ we needed a living God a living
[1:10:12] God who makes himself
[1:10:14] real we needed God in a real way sir in
[1:10:19] that same message Satan's eaten brother
[1:10:21] Bram also takes up that point where he
[1:10:23] says I understand around here I hope
[1:10:26] you're I hope you're with me I'm talking
[1:10:28] about how we GD our loins about with
[1:10:30] truth it's knowing where we're standing
[1:10:32] brother BR says I I understand he said
[1:10:34] around here he says it's being said 1965
[1:10:37] Satan's Eden why doesn't brother Brandon
[1:10:39] preach on the Holy Ghost that's always
[1:10:41] been a quote on Marvel of thought find
[1:10:42] one service where he
[1:10:45] doesn't see what it was it was the age
[1:10:48] it was an overlapping it was looking
[1:10:51] back to isus of Pentecost and here you
[1:10:54] had the word being delivered isusa was
[1:10:57] not the
[1:10:59] restoration no that was gifts coming
[1:11:01] back but the restoration was back to the
[1:11:04] word himself the promise that the son of
[1:11:07] man Christ in his fullness would return
[1:11:10] once
[1:11:10] again is that
[1:11:13] right understand brother Brown he's not
[1:11:15] he's not preaching on the on on the Holy
[1:11:17] Ghost brother Brown says oh he says
[1:11:18] here's the answer he says here's what it
[1:11:20] is he said the Holy Ghost is the person
[1:11:23] of Christ in you that's Quicken to every
[1:11:26] word for this age don't watch it he said
[1:11:28] so much in demonstration watch it in
[1:11:31] action right are you hearing me there
[1:11:35] can be a lot of demonstrations in the
[1:11:37] house of God but what matters is the
[1:11:39] action That Goes Forth even on the
[1:11:41] outside are you hearing me see it's
[1:11:43] taking it back to the word because the
[1:11:45] word itself will always be the word the
[1:11:48] word will always act like the word the
[1:11:49] word will always behave according to the
[1:11:52] word oh my I love that this is keeping
[1:11:55] the punches off of us now notice in
[1:11:58] Romans 6:7 for he that is
[1:12:01] dead is freed from sin that's that's so
[1:12:04] important he that is dead is freed from
[1:12:06] sin now if we be dead with Christ we
[1:12:09] believe that we shall also live with him
[1:12:13] knowing that Christ being raised from
[1:12:16] the dead dieth no more death hath no
[1:12:19] more dominion over him for in that he
[1:12:22] died he died unto sin once but in that
[1:12:25] he liveth he liveth unto God likewise
[1:12:29] reckon now Paul wasn't a southerner this
[1:12:31] is the word likewise reckon ye also
[1:12:35] yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin
[1:12:39] but alive unto God through Jesus Christ
[1:12:42] Our Lord that word reckon this is what
[1:12:44] it is it's a word that deals with
[1:12:47] reality if I and I don't know how to
[1:12:50] pronounce that word reckon that my bank
[1:12:52] account has $25 in it it has $25 in it
[1:12:56] otherwise I'm deceiving myself this word
[1:13:00] refers to facts not
[1:13:03] suppositions likewise reckon yourself in
[1:13:06] other words think this is exactly what
[1:13:09] God has made away for me let me tell you
[1:13:12] something he does not have to go back to
[1:13:14] Calvary to pay for one sin or one
[1:13:17] failure he doesn't have to take one more
[1:13:20] strip to heal somebody
[1:13:22] else he said I'm the Lord that for for
[1:13:25] us all th iniquities I'm the Lord that
[1:13:27] heal us all thy diseases he did it once
[1:13:31] and for all and you and I are
[1:13:34] beneficiaries of that work at
[1:13:37] Calvary it's not what you're looking at
[1:13:40] you're looking at the lamb it's to

[1:15:00] scripture you see Romans
[1:15:04] six I love the book of Romans I love all
[1:15:07] the Bible I guess I can't say one but
[1:15:10] you know Romans six is a real
[1:15:12] sanctification chapter but
[1:15:14] sanctification doesn't end with
[1:15:16] sanctification sanctification goes
[1:15:19] on are you hearing me so this is not a
[1:15:21] chapter we cross out of and we we never
[1:15:23] go back into it the very next chapter is
[1:15:25] the chapter that I read to you last week
[1:15:27] out of Romans 7 where Paul said when I
[1:15:29] would go to do good evil is
[1:15:31] present is that right so watch this this
[1:15:34] this is just this is application in
[1:15:36] verse 12 let not sin what is sin
[1:15:40] unbelief what is unbelief anything
[1:15:43] that's against God's
[1:15:45] word hallelujah now the devil can say
[1:15:48] well you know it isn't that God's Not A
[1:15:51] Healer but he's not your healer he's a
[1:15:53] liar because let let me tell you
[1:15:55] something you did not read in the
[1:15:56] scripture where it just had a list of
[1:15:58] names and you had to try to find your
[1:15:59] names he he included it all in there I'm
[1:16:02] the Lord that Health all thy diseases by
[1:16:05] his traps we were healed I'm part of
[1:16:08] that we my name is in that we amen it I
[1:16:12] was the reason that he came from glory
[1:16:14] and came down and paid the price I was
[1:16:17] the reason brother Roco he got up on
[1:16:19] that Easter morning I am that reason
[1:16:22] Hall
[1:16:25] yes
[1:16:26] Hallelujah let not unbelief anything
[1:16:31] contrary rain in your mortal body you
[1:16:34] know what something is this word to rain
[1:16:36] it means be it's basilio which means to
[1:16:38] exercise like a kingly
[1:16:43] approach I don't feel like this and then
[1:16:45] all of a sudden the actions start going
[1:16:47] down we start listening to that and we
[1:16:49] get down I I don't feel like I'm saved I
[1:16:52] I don't feel like much of a Christian
[1:16:53] let me tell you something God God wants
[1:16:55] to build and his desire is to stabilize
[1:16:58] every life and every heart amen are you
[1:17:01] hearing me that's God's desire then you
[1:17:03] know what the only way that'll ever be
[1:17:05] EST established is by the word of God
[1:17:08] it's the word of God that builds your
[1:17:09] life up listen I'm not reading something
[1:17:11] off the back of a cough sir I'm telling
[1:17:13] you the word of God that I've
[1:17:15] experienced in my own life it takes the
[1:17:17] word to build your life
[1:17:20] up Hallelujah this is why why do you
[1:17:22] think Satan wants to try to feel your
[1:17:25] mind with so many other
[1:17:26] things we can get the feeling
[1:17:28] comfortable in our walk with God and we
[1:17:31] begin to get so close so many other
[1:17:34] things are gathered around in our mind
[1:17:37] that we think on WE dwell on and
[1:17:40] eventually we start talking
[1:17:41] about see this is why the scripture said
[1:17:44] this is our charge gir up the loin of
[1:17:47] your mind gir your loins about with
[1:17:50] truth that's our charge
[1:17:56] Hallelujah yes sir neither now what why
[1:18:00] don't rain don't let it rain in your
[1:18:01] mortal body that you should obey it in
[1:18:03] the lust thereof neither yield ye your
[1:18:07] members as instruments of
[1:18:09] unrighteousness Unto sin but yield
[1:18:11] yourselves unto God as those that are
[1:18:14] alive from the dead and your members as
[1:18:17] instruments of righteousness unto God
[1:18:20] for sin shall not have dominion over you
[1:18:23] for ye are not under the law but under
[1:18:27] grace
[1:18:28] amen questions and answers part four if
[1:18:32] the case may be that the devil is
[1:18:35] placing thoughts in your mind about a
[1:18:37] certain thing how may it be overcome or
[1:18:40] got rid
[1:18:42] of you ready for this deep one take the
[1:18:46] very vice versa from
[1:18:48] it because the devil's a
[1:18:51] liar that's good if the devil makes you
[1:18:54] think you know if you know you're a
[1:18:57] Christian and he tries to make you think
[1:18:59] you're not a Christian just take the
[1:19:01] Versa and say I am a Christian as long
[1:19:05] as your experience matches in God's word
[1:19:08] say I'm a Christian and anything else
[1:19:12] the same way that's great yeah good goes
[1:19:15] on down in paragraph 69 same same quote
[1:19:19] God grant you're overcoming ever who you
[1:19:21] are may your thoughts just go right back
[1:19:23] the other side and say I am a Christian
[1:19:26] I am a believer Satan you have no hold
[1:19:29] on me now watch this brother BR the very
[1:19:32] next quote says frankly I'm standing
[1:19:34] here right now saying the same thing to
[1:19:36] keep from fainting right here at the
[1:19:38] pull pit I've almost fainted four or
[1:19:41] five times I've almost pitched over the
[1:19:43] pull pit that's the truth God knows
[1:19:44] that's right now he wasn't getting ready
[1:19:46] to pitch over because he didn't think he
[1:19:48] was a Christian he's talking how Satan
[1:19:50] is battling him even in his mind in his
[1:19:53] body he's feeling the weakness within
[1:19:55] his body and he's standing at his post
[1:19:58] of Duty and Satan is there attacking him
[1:20:00] and he's getting ready feels like to
[1:20:02] pitch over four or five times and he
[1:20:04] said I'm having to take the exact
[1:20:07] opposite of it you see it applies to
[1:20:09] every part in every phase of our life
[1:20:12] when Satan you know one of the ways that
[1:20:13] you always know that it's Satan that's
[1:20:15] talking is you can always tell when he
[1:20:18] comes it never comes with encouragement
[1:20:21] it never comes in a way to point you to
[1:20:24] Calvary he don't want you to see
[1:20:27] Calvary are you hearing me he don't want
[1:20:29] you to see that there is a way back he
[1:20:31] do not he does not want you to see that
[1:20:35] there is one who is standing on your
[1:20:37] behalf but you know what when the spirit
[1:20:40] of God will come and tell us we're wrong
[1:20:42] there's something on the inside that
[1:20:44] rises up we're pointed to Calvary and
[1:20:46] because the word of God is hidden within
[1:20:49] our hearts by the new birth there's a
[1:20:51] desire that rises up and saying Thank
[1:20:53] You Lord God for your mercy there's a
[1:20:56] repentance that goes out of our heart
[1:20:58] forgive me Lord for my wrong Lord is
[1:21:01] that right thank God for that thank God
[1:21:04] for that convicting power there on the
[1:21:07] inside that'll convict us when we're
[1:21:08] wrong but Satan when he comes he can
[1:21:11] take a hold of the same quotes same
[1:21:13] scripture but you'll always feel an
[1:21:15] oppressive condemning pressure and
[1:21:18] spirit behind it because Satan cannot
[1:21:20] offer you any
[1:21:22] atonement is that right and the other
[1:21:25] part the brother Brown lays it down so
[1:21:27] clearly when your experience matches
[1:21:29] God's word you're able to stand right
[1:21:31] there and say I am a Christian matches
[1:21:34] it by what that you hit seven days out
[1:21:36] of seven no but that your life itself on
[1:21:40] the inside my desires is for him that's
[1:21:45] so he is my all in allwe
[1:21:50] hallu oh my brother brandom you know and
[1:21:53] he's asked even another Place talking
[1:21:55] about overcoming remember brother R
[1:21:56] would tell us on overcoming you've got
[1:21:58] to recognize the devil and every one of
[1:22:00] his tricks not just that well the devil
[1:22:02] that's just some bad thought no the
[1:22:04] Devil is a is a is a real being just as
[1:22:06] much as the Holy Spirit when it said
[1:22:08] when he the spirit of Truth has come
[1:22:11] it's a real being a holy spirit is a
[1:22:14] real being it's the person of Christ so
[1:22:17] where thoughts themselves I know I've
[1:22:19] said this to you many times but thoughts
[1:22:21] themselves are not just random things
[1:22:23] that just come flying by our away it's
[1:22:25] Spirits that's trying to get at us
[1:22:28] that's what it is it's Satan wanting to
[1:22:30] get at us he's one to one to try to th
[1:22:33] and hinder you realize this is why Satan
[1:22:36] knew what was coming on the road to
[1:22:38] Abraham and Sarah's tent who do you
[1:22:41] think stirred up that fight in the tent
[1:22:43] that
[1:22:44] morning come on friends who do you think
[1:22:48] stirred that up when here they were
[1:22:49] fussing and and they had you know a good
[1:22:51] fuss but you know what they didn't know
[1:22:54] what was coming down the road but Satan
[1:22:56] was trying to get it stirred up so that
[1:22:58] they would miss their
[1:23:02] visitation is it no Marvel how Satan
[1:23:04] will try to get get to us right before
[1:23:09] service every time Saturday night Sunday
[1:23:13] morning Thursday Every Time come on now
[1:23:17] but for all you perfect ones I'll just
[1:23:18] fellowship with the rest for just a
[1:23:20] moment how Satan wants to try to get at
[1:23:23] everything and try to punch at
[1:23:25] everything you know why he's afraid of
[1:23:28] that word coming and being received in
[1:23:31] our
[1:23:32] lives cuz the word will expose him the
[1:23:35] word will cast him
[1:23:37] out oh my there's a real devil and then
[1:23:40] to recognize in order to overcome it
[1:23:43] you've got to recognize that the god in
[1:23:45] you is greater and mightier than he is
[1:23:47] that the one in you has already overcome
[1:23:50] him and by his grace you are more than a
[1:23:53] match for him There's real overcoming
[1:23:56] when you
[1:23:58] recognize you're able to look back
[1:24:00] across your
[1:24:01] life and you see not what I used to
[1:24:05] be are you hearing me I'm I'm telling
[1:24:08] you what the prophet said here this is
[1:24:10] how this is how you recognize you can
[1:24:12] look back and realize hey I'm not what I
[1:24:14] used to be there's no condemnation in my
[1:24:16] life there's no opposition to the word
[1:24:18] of God the my my spirit and the spirit
[1:24:21] of God there is an agreement with the
[1:24:23] word of God then you're able to look
[1:24:25] back and when you can see that are you
[1:24:27] hearing me when you can see that then
[1:24:29] the prophet said then you realize you've
[1:24:32] overcome because how can you be defeated
[1:24:35] when the Overcomer is inside of you
[1:24:39] you've already
[1:24:43] overcome but so many times we get to
[1:24:45] looking at other
[1:24:48] things and to realize wait a minute who
[1:24:50] brought me where I'm at right here who
[1:24:53] changed my life who changed my desires
[1:24:56] who changed my nature who did this and
[1:24:59] you begin to Fellowship on the Overcomer
[1:25:03] and
[1:25:07] overcoming there's things no doubt that
[1:25:09] you and I come to you come to I come to
[1:25:12] things in your life right now that
[1:25:13] you're facing
[1:25:15] battling right and you know what you
[1:25:17] could have never faced it
[1:25:20] before it's just like when they go
[1:25:22] through brother Bram would liken it when
[1:25:23] they were doing the battle of the Civil
[1:25:25] War in this nation and brother BR would
[1:25:27] take it and how he would say it like
[1:25:29] this you know how did Grant take
[1:25:30] Richmond how did different ones take you
[1:25:33] know as they're going through a
[1:25:33] progression of a battle when you look at
[1:25:35] even when Joshua came into the promised
[1:25:38] land they didn't go and you know take
[1:25:40] this one and and then go over here but
[1:25:43] they there there was a taking of Jericho
[1:25:45] then it went to AI it just kept on
[1:25:47] unfolding all the way through because
[1:25:50] remember what Canaan represents it's a
[1:25:53] land of overcoming
[1:25:56] come on now it's a time of
[1:25:59] battle it's a time of War let me tell
[1:26:02] you something this is why Satan will try
[1:26:04] to come and he'll try to come right at
[1:26:06] you and try to talk you out of what God
[1:26:09] has already put in your
[1:26:11] life don't you lay your weapon down
[1:26:13] that's why the prophet could turn around
[1:26:15] said brother Nev don't you ever lay that
[1:26:17] weapon of the word down Satan will try
[1:26:19] to make you doubt your weapon your
[1:26:22] weapon is sufficient you might say I've
[1:26:24] been rebuking him all day keep cutting
[1:26:26] at him chop a hole through him it might
[1:26:30] be this small right now keep whing with
[1:26:32] that word I know what God did for me I
[1:26:35] know what God has done in my life you
[1:26:37] keep whacking at it the prophet said
[1:26:38] that's what Abraham did he said when
[1:26:42] that old gloomy Spirit came that he says
[1:26:44] it like this that gloomy spooky Spirit
[1:26:46] came around Abraham and wanted to try to
[1:26:49] taunt him he said Abraham took the sword
[1:26:51] he said he whacked it if it stayed there
[1:26:53] whacked it again again whacked it again
[1:26:55] he said he poked a hole poked a hole and
[1:26:57] eventually the hole got
[1:27:05] bigger
[1:27:07] sometimes we get
[1:27:09] tired we get
[1:27:12] weary yeah we get weary but remember
[1:27:16] listen to me your
[1:27:19] feelings are not your
[1:27:22] absolute I love to feel the Pres of God
[1:27:25] yeah I do but your feelings are not your
[1:27:28] absolute your absolute is the word of
[1:27:31] God
[1:27:32] am there'll be times in your life when
[1:27:35] you're walking remember the prophet said
[1:27:36] it like this he said when I was a young
[1:27:39] Christian he said Satan he said would
[1:27:41] beat me around the stump on my
[1:27:46] feelings he said he would you know come
[1:27:48] he said I'll tell you he said Till I
[1:27:50] finally learned he said it ain't based
[1:27:52] on my feelings it's based on the word of
[1:27:55] God that I have met God's requirements
[1:27:59] that's
[1:28:01] settled
[1:28:03] right this is this is the strength and
[1:28:06] as we're giring the loins of our mind as
[1:28:09] we come to these things this is how we
[1:28:11] take fears doubts there's things that we
[1:28:14] deal with of things that God brings us
[1:28:17] to deal with complexes fears we didn't
[1:28:19] even know was down in there that's true
[1:28:22] things that he brings us but you know
[1:28:23] what but remember God would does not in
[1:28:26] the business of overwhelming you and I
[1:28:28] he's in the business of displaying his
[1:28:30] overcoming power through our
[1:28:33] lives so the only way we can take these
[1:28:35] areas is as we come to them and as we
[1:28:38] come to them we take the word of God
[1:28:40] when one Rises its head we chop it off
[1:28:44] brother Ram tells a
[1:28:45] story about a
[1:28:47] man that he said you know he had a dream
[1:28:51] and the devil was a little bitty old
[1:28:53] thing and run up to him and and said you
[1:28:56] know it said boo and he jumped back and
[1:28:59] the devil got bigger boo he jumped back
[1:29:02] and the devil got bigger finally the
[1:29:05] devil got as big as he was was going to
[1:29:08] overcome him he know he had to fight
[1:29:11] with something so he looked around and
[1:29:14] he couldn't find nothing to fight with
[1:29:16] kind of sounds like
[1:29:18] Samson sounds like
[1:29:21] shamgar Hallelujah he just picked up the
[1:29:25] Bible and he and the devil said boo he
[1:29:27] said boo right back notice he picked up
[1:29:29] the Bible and the devil said boo he said
[1:29:32] boo back and the devil got little and
[1:29:34] little and little and finally he beat
[1:29:37] him to death with the
[1:29:40] word notice he picked up the Bible yes
[1:29:43] sir and he began to boo back to the
[1:29:46] devil you know what that symbolize that
[1:29:48] ain't you holding on to this leather or
[1:29:50] imitation letter it's you taking a hold
[1:29:52] of the word and standing in there on the
[1:29:54] word regardless of how you feel
[1:29:56] regardless of any other thought it's
[1:29:59] casting down every imagination and
[1:30:02] holding God's word to be the truth and
[1:30:04] say Boo devil these are my promises boo
[1:30:07] devil take a hold of that word and stand
[1:30:10] there Toe to Toe with Him Glory
[1:30:13] Hallelujah Hallelujah you know what the
[1:30:16] word puts him down to size for what he
[1:30:18] really
[1:30:20] is hallelujah this is where the
[1:30:22] scripture says in Ephesians 4:27 neither
[1:30:27] give place to the devil that means don't
[1:30:31] give him don't give him any place it'd
[1:30:33] be like you know if we appear on the
[1:30:36] platform somebody said hey you know what
[1:30:38] we'd like to bring bring a a fish tank
[1:30:40] and put it up here
[1:30:42] sorry no we' like to just put one right
[1:30:44] here we can we can put one right here we
[1:30:46] put a fish tank right here sorry you're
[1:30:48] not going to put one right
[1:30:50] here but but it's an empty space it's
[1:30:54] sitting for fish
[1:30:55] tanks you're not going to put one in
[1:30:57] here are you hearing me neither give
[1:31:01] place to the devil that means give
[1:31:03] license or a place some means of
[1:31:08] authority of
[1:31:10] acting now remember remember this cannot
[1:31:14] take place unless we permit
[1:31:18] it right it can't it can't it can't come
[1:31:21] in it cannot happen unless we permit it
[1:31:23] now listen what the prophet says here
[1:31:25] just I want you to listen let me just
[1:31:26] drop this in if Satan can get through
[1:31:30] there if he can get by all these
[1:31:33] conscience and things he gets right down
[1:31:34] here in the end of the spirit in the
[1:31:37] mind you'll never look at one of them
[1:31:41] until first you have to let him in here
[1:31:43] you have to let him in do you realize
[1:31:45] what he's bringing you and I are the
[1:31:47] ones in
[1:31:48] control we're in control of the thoughts
[1:31:51] that we
[1:31:52] receive sometimes we wonder why does it
[1:31:54] seem like that that that this is why
[1:31:56] there's a weakness why why does it seem
[1:31:58] like I I you know that things are are
[1:32:00] just a little weak it depends on what
[1:32:02] you're taking in it depends on what
[1:32:04] you're feeding on sometimes we ready
[1:32:07] we're ready to go out man I'm ready to
[1:32:08] go out for battle and War we don't go
[1:32:10] out to battle and War on hype are you
[1:32:13] hearing me well I'm a Son of God I'm a
[1:32:14] Son of God you don't go out to battle on
[1:32:16] hype right you go to battle with the
[1:32:19] word of God Amen yeah are you hearing me
[1:32:22] it's wonderful to be encouraged and we
[1:32:24] should be encouraged right it's just
[1:32:26] like when we and I played football we
[1:32:28] had pep rallies at times on Friday and
[1:32:30] oh man everybody you know in the stands
[1:32:32] and things you'd walk through the
[1:32:33] gymnasium or Auditorium man they were
[1:32:35] all hyping but let me tell you something
[1:32:37] going out there was not based on their
[1:32:39] hype there had been practice all week
[1:32:43] long studying play studying film taking
[1:32:47] tests on different movements of the
[1:32:49] opposing defense and offense it was a
[1:32:51] grueling task right so it wasn't the pep
[1:32:55] rally that made me ready it's the word
[1:32:58] of
[1:33:01] God hallelujah I want you to think of
[1:33:05] this here he says you have to let him in
[1:33:08] then when he gets in he's got control
[1:33:12] now watch what he'll do he'll begin to
[1:33:14] use the
[1:33:17] conscience he begins to use this Outlet
[1:33:21] taste feel smell hear imaginations
[1:33:26] conscience memory reasons affections
[1:33:30] he'll when he gets in now how does he
[1:33:33] want to use them he wants to use them to
[1:33:36] put separation between you and
[1:33:40] God he wants to use him well yeah he's a
[1:33:43] Healer but your
[1:33:47] case he'll want to get in upon memory
[1:33:50] well remember remember how many times
[1:33:52] you failed him
[1:33:56] then he'll want to get in upon the Gate
[1:33:58] of affection he'll want to get in upon
[1:34:00] every one of these Gates now listen if
[1:34:02] he gets in he begins to use those Gates
[1:34:06] Right are you understanding me because
[1:34:08] one of these days we we will not have to
[1:34:10] have a stinger taken out of memory one
[1:34:13] of these days we will not have to have
[1:34:15] where I don't where where no longer the
[1:34:17] thoughts and things like that and
[1:34:18] memories one of these days why it will
[1:34:20] all be cleared away when we step from
[1:34:23] this dimension
[1:34:24] into that other dimension we will not
[1:34:26] receive another human Spirit we will
[1:34:28] have a theoy it will replace that human
[1:34:31] spirit and then we take upon a glorified
[1:34:34] body of what a body of this earth when
[1:34:37] we come back cuz we're always meant to
[1:34:39] live in a three- room house because
[1:34:41] we're not going to be walking around
[1:34:43] with all these memories that's right are
[1:34:46] you hearing me but you see how Satan
[1:34:48] just likes to be so selective if you
[1:34:51] start entertaining it he can get right
[1:34:53] in there say well you're not that good
[1:34:54] of a Christian you know you're not that
[1:34:56] you're not that good he can start
[1:34:58] working on that and the prophet would
[1:35:00] take it he said don't you let him stand
[1:35:04] anywhere GL he can start to stand there
[1:35:08] and want to accuse you what's he trying
[1:35:10] to do hinder you and it start to affect
[1:35:13] you you know how it affects you it'll
[1:35:15] affect you in your prayer life it'll
[1:35:16] affect you in your approach to the word
[1:35:18] it'll affect you in coming to the house
[1:35:20] of God because why he's trying to come
[1:35:23] against faith in your
[1:35:26] life listen friends that's why it's so
[1:35:28] important to have the soldier to have
[1:35:30] the Holy Ghost the word of God down on
[1:35:33] the inside not just in our mind that can
[1:35:35] go away quickly the prophet talked about
[1:35:38] that woman who was a Sunday school
[1:35:39] teacher she you know she dressed saintly
[1:35:42] and godly and everything but she got in
[1:35:44] a neighborhood and started going to
[1:35:46] another church where they guess they
[1:35:48] dress scandalously and she begin to see
[1:35:50] certain things and here she is looking
[1:35:53] at how they're addressing and said well
[1:35:54] if they can do it I can do it too it was
[1:35:57] presented in her mind in reasoning
[1:36:00] that's right if she would have had the
[1:36:03] good man of the house there Faith the
[1:36:05] word of God the word of God would have
[1:36:07] stood right against that and said but
[1:36:10] it's not right and not fit woman should
[1:36:13] be dressed in modest apparel that
[1:36:16] doesn't mean what's the latest on GQ or
[1:36:18] whatever the magazine is it means free
[1:36:20] flowing un
[1:36:22] clinging on and on we could go within
[1:36:25] there in the script you see but
[1:36:26] reasoning caught a hold of it if she
[1:36:28] would have had something down there on
[1:36:30] the inside it would have stood against
[1:36:33] it I'm was going to preach as it's
[1:36:35] coming to me there might have been
[1:36:38] things that even as sister sometimes
[1:36:40] there's certain things that you bought
[1:36:41] and you realize when you got it home
[1:36:44] something just ain't right
[1:36:46] here something just ain't right I I
[1:36:48] don't feel right in this what should I
[1:36:50] do don't reason with it just take it
[1:36:53] back yeah are you hearing me don't
[1:36:57] reason with it you because listen it's a
[1:36:59] holy spirit of God that's trying to
[1:37:01] protect you he's the word he watches
[1:37:04] over you and I you can take up something
[1:37:07] and you know reasoning can strike well
[1:37:09] this ain't that bad or this ain't that
[1:37:10] bad but then there's something about it
[1:37:12] that I just can't feel settled within it
[1:37:15] don't reason with it amen that even
[1:37:18] comes friends even the way that we can
[1:37:20] approach even serving God don't try to
[1:37:23] reason with things well you know God
[1:37:25] will accept this and God's okay with
[1:37:27] this and God's all right with this
[1:37:29] listen don't accept reasonings anything
[1:37:32] that reasons against the word let me
[1:37:34] just say what the prophet said is your
[1:37:38] enemy
[1:37:40] anything that reasons against the word
[1:37:42] of God is your enemy and anything that's
[1:37:44] for the word is your
[1:37:50] friend oh my
[1:37:55] he began to
[1:37:56] use let me just try to finish this part
[1:37:59] tie it up he began to use all those
[1:38:02] different little channels as long as he
[1:38:04] could get in that's why Satan listen
[1:38:07] Satan can use
[1:38:11] imagination oh yeah Satan can put in my
[1:38:13] mind you know what brother Aaron's got
[1:38:14] something against you you know why he's
[1:38:16] setting on
[1:38:18] you brother Aon might be
[1:38:21] tired now what happens if I entertain
[1:38:23] that if I entertain it a thought then
[1:38:27] begins to register and then I'm the one
[1:38:29] who starts acting
[1:38:31] funny and I've created all this has been
[1:38:33] created because just a thought has come
[1:38:36] he's got something against me I know it
[1:38:38] I could tell by how he looked he might
[1:38:40] be hungry and tired it might had nothing
[1:38:44] to do with me it might just be what he's
[1:38:45] looking at in terms of that he's really
[1:38:48] trying to focus in on the word maybe
[1:38:50] he's you like this or something but you
[1:38:52] see look you see how Satan can do
[1:38:55] that and then what's he trying to do get
[1:38:57] right in there and when he if it can let
[1:38:59] him in like yeah you know what other any
[1:39:01] other time he'd be smiling I mean his
[1:39:03] smile would be covering up everything
[1:39:05] nose eyes and everything else he'd be
[1:39:07] smiling there is true you see if I go
[1:39:09] along with
[1:39:11] that who will it affect it'll eventually
[1:39:13] affect him but it'll affect
[1:39:17] me yep I'll go to bed with it at night
[1:39:20] I'll drive with it woo getting somewhere
[1:39:24] but I'm not going to go all there
[1:39:26] tonight but see when he can get into
[1:39:29] this he can get into it if we let him
[1:39:32] into those Outlets I don't know about
[1:39:35] you but I just want to put up the sign
[1:39:36] CU it's already there no
[1:39:38] trespassing no trespassing no
[1:39:41] trespassing right brother BR says he's
[1:39:44] got to come in your mind first and you
[1:39:45] have to accept it it can batter against
[1:39:49] you but it can't get to you until you
[1:39:51] accept it you know what that batter
[1:39:53] means constantly blows repeated blows
[1:39:58] not just insinuation these are
[1:40:01] blows lot of hot
[1:40:03] air hard blows let me let me let me tie
[1:40:06] this up
[1:40:10] here this is where these things and this
[1:40:13] is where it starts friends listen I I
[1:40:15] know I I I know I we we we come here and
[1:40:18] here we are set and sometimes this the
[1:40:20] most comfortable most relaxing place
[1:40:21] that we've had all week
[1:40:24] sometimes this the most restful time
[1:40:27] right I don't want you to bring blankets
[1:40:29] or nothing like that here you know and
[1:40:30] pillows but I mean it's sometimes the
[1:40:33] most peaceful most relaxing because
[1:40:34] we're going like sometimes you it's just
[1:40:35] times you're going like a house on fire
[1:40:37] and things on your mind and everything
[1:40:39] and you know but as we're going along
[1:40:41] and I want you to think about that of
[1:40:43] having our loins G about with truth and
[1:40:46] GD up the loins of our
[1:40:48] mind and it matters the things that we
[1:40:50] feed on I I know we hear that said an
[1:40:52] awful lot but it's very true remember
[1:40:54] this Battleground is called No Man's
[1:40:59] Land it's kind of like on this stage as
[1:41:03] I was saying moments
[1:41:04] before we can put on this stage if this
[1:41:08] is a room we can put up here whatsoever
[1:41:11] we
[1:41:12] choose we can fill it with what we
[1:41:14] choose we can fill it with you know
[1:41:16] having a butcher block having a buffet
[1:41:18] table we can fill it with whatever we
[1:41:20] want but there are some things that you
[1:41:21] would just simply say as I was saying
[1:41:24] about the fish tank and other things you
[1:41:25] would say it don't belong there it don't
[1:41:28] belong fish tank is fine at your house
[1:41:31] in front window whatever the Butcher
[1:41:33] Block fine in your kitchen but it don't
[1:41:34] belong up
[1:41:35] here right don't belong up here having
[1:41:38] like a whole Pantry up here a shelf
[1:41:40] that's filled with cereals and
[1:41:41] everything else don't belong up
[1:41:42] here right there's just certain things
[1:41:44] that don't belong but you know who it is
[1:41:46] that
[1:41:47] determines what gets put there in our
[1:41:49] mind us
[1:41:55] sometimes we we we should be praying
[1:41:57] listen we should be praying for
[1:41:58] Revelation that's true but let me just
[1:42:01] say this to you it's kind of like when I
[1:42:03] go through and I'm getting ready to to
[1:42:05] minister and there's things sometimes
[1:42:06] that it's like I've told you sometimes
[1:42:08] these thoughts and things we're coming
[1:42:10] to it's it's taken months to finally get
[1:42:12] into something of this part but you know
[1:42:14] as I come to it I just go through and
[1:42:16] I'll just study quotes and quotes and
[1:42:19] scriptures you probably think man you
[1:42:20] got them all included no I don't but
[1:42:23] I'll just go through and study and study
[1:42:25] and stud you know why I just want to
[1:42:27] fill my mind right now I want my heart
[1:42:29] to be filled but I want my mind you know
[1:42:31] why because I want the Holy Spirit if
[1:42:33] there's something that he decides to
[1:42:35] pull out and retrieve that I don't have
[1:42:37] in this outline he knows what we have
[1:42:40] need of I want him to be able to
[1:42:43] retrieve it so don't worry about trying
[1:42:45] to make sense out of it just just F your
[1:42:47] mind with the things of God fill it with
[1:42:50] truth when truth has come to your life
[1:42:53] life gge yourself with that truth when
[1:42:55] the word comes to encourage you and
[1:42:57] strengthen you on what you ought to be
[1:42:59] looking at just don't let it pass by but
[1:43:02] take it right up next to you and say
[1:43:04] I'll take that thank you Lord you know
[1:43:06] what that's doing that's taking up the
[1:43:08] Bible and saying boo
[1:43:12] devil let me read this in
[1:43:14] closing BR says when you get to thinking
[1:43:17] about Divine Healing get to thinking
[1:43:19] about Christ keep him on your mind
[1:43:24] if there be any praise if there be any
[1:43:25] virtue the Bible says think on these
[1:43:27] things isn't amazing how you can sit in
[1:43:29] church and the devil have you going down
[1:43:31] the uh the aisles of Target Walmart
[1:43:36] maybe not Target but but just around the
[1:43:39] corner ain't it amazing he can have you
[1:43:41] thinking man this must be the problem at
[1:43:43] working this is how we're going to solve
[1:43:44] it isin't it amazing right here how
[1:43:46] Satan want you know why because your
[1:43:49] mind is a place that God wants it to be
[1:43:52] right on the word to receive the
[1:43:55] word this is why it's so important even
[1:43:57] as we come into the house of God we come
[1:43:59] in in prayer I I know sometimes friends
[1:44:02] we come in on Thursday nights we come
[1:44:04] from our workplace we come from other
[1:44:06] things and we've got the cares of life
[1:44:07] and what but whatever you can do even
[1:44:09] when you're on the way here say Lord let
[1:44:13] my heart be prepared for you Lord let it
[1:44:16] be prepared for you this is why the
[1:44:18] singing the music is all into a place to
[1:44:20] get us settled to help us and help us to
[1:44:23] enter into that place of worship for the
[1:44:24] word to be able to come forth if any
[1:44:27] thought comes by well maybe it couldn't
[1:44:28] be so get it off your mind right quick
[1:44:31] think on things that's positive never
[1:44:35] let a negative thought pass through this
[1:44:38] is what's key don't let it stop anyhow
[1:44:42] if it starts to keep your thoughts
[1:44:45] positive Jesus don't think sitting there
[1:44:49] in the wheelchair that you're hopeless
[1:44:51] and helpless you're not not don't let
[1:44:54] that negative thought ever pass through
[1:44:56] don't let it anchor you can't help it
[1:45:00] from going through your mind but don't
[1:45:02] let it
[1:45:04] stop like the old farmer said I can't
[1:45:07] keep the birds from flying over my place
[1:45:09] but he had a double barreled shotgun and
[1:45:11] said I can sure keep him from roosting
[1:45:13] so do you the same thing and you too
[1:45:16] don't let them Roost let them pass right
[1:45:18] on through here's the shotgun both new
[1:45:22] and old Testament a double barrel and
[1:45:24] it's very good too it keeps them
[1:45:29] away the promises of God that's why we
[1:45:32] want to Avail ourselves with the word of
[1:45:35] almighty God we can't keep thoughts from
[1:45:38] passing through but we can keep them
[1:45:40] from
[1:45:41] rooting this is where the scripture said
[1:45:44] let not sin therefore rain in your
[1:45:46] mortal body don't let it remain don't
[1:45:48] let it anchor down don't let it start
[1:45:50] building the nest one piece of straw
[1:45:51] another piece of straw another piece of
[1:45:53] straw another p and pretty soon there's
[1:45:54] a stronghold pretty soon there's a place
[1:45:56] that's given pretty soon there's a place
[1:45:58] that's created a place that's given
[1:46:00] there this is where we want to stand and
[1:46:02] hold the word of God and any thought
[1:46:05] that comes in contrary to the word of
[1:46:08] God you may not even have a written
[1:46:10] scripture on it but you know his
[1:46:12] character you know his character and you
[1:46:15] look at that and you say the way that
[1:46:16] thought come that's not according to the
[1:46:18] character of the Lord Jesus you know why
[1:46:19] you know him you know him to be the same
[1:46:23] Lord Jesus you have been acquainted and
[1:46:26] and connected and United with the
[1:46:28] character of Jesus
[1:46:30] Christ don't you love him don't you just
[1:46:34] want to Just Surrender everything and
[1:46:35] all that you got Lord let every part of
[1:46:39] my life let's just stand together let
[1:46:41] everything and all that is Within Me
[1:46:43] Lord let it be fully surrendered to you

[1:49:55] something there's someone that picked up
[1:49:57] our
[1:49:59] debt we didn't even have the money
[1:50:01] they're wanting a credit card that could
[1:50:03] cover sin debt but he paid the price he
[1:50:06] shed his blood and he sent back the Holy
[1:50:10] Ghost to seek you and I out and bring
[1:50:13] conviction to our heart to point out to
[1:50:15] us this is what I did for you on Calvary
[1:50:18] this is why I rose on that Easter
[1:50:20] morning this is why I sended it high
[1:50:22] over every reprint and parity and over
[1:50:24] all of those things and sent back the
[1:50:26] holy spirit this is why for
[1:50:30] you I just say it like this tonight if
[1:50:33] you don't know him what an opportunity
[1:50:34] to really Surrender Your Life to him and
[1:50:37] it's an opportunity to say Lord let the
[1:50:40] word go down on the
[1:50:42] inside Lord let it fall to the inside
[1:50:46] let it and Lord let my life I want my
[1:50:50] life I want that responsib
[1:50:53] possibility of ging it about with truth
[1:50:56] cuz you're not going to do that for me I
[1:50:59] have to do
[1:51:00] that I want to take that I said Lord I
[1:51:04] want to pick it up remember when you
[1:51:06] begin to feel slack the prophet says and
[1:51:09] the devil says it's no use I won't ask
[1:51:11] you to raise your hands but probably the
[1:51:13] devil has told you it's no use you know
[1:51:17] how you're to respond at that time
[1:51:19] tighten it
[1:51:20] up pull the sword a little tighter to
[1:51:23] you tighten it up with truth I am one of
[1:51:27] his I belong to him amen you you've got
[1:51:30] you've got a right to tighten that up

[1:51:38] with that real determination and
[1:51:41] surrender in our hearts Lord I'm going
[1:51:44] to surrender my
[1:51:47] time I'm going to surrender my
[1:51:51] thoughts I'm going to surrender Lord
