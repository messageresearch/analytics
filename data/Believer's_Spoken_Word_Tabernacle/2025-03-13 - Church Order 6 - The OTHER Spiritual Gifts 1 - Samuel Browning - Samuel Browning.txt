did you send that to me on that that was on telegram right yeah all right praise the Lord sister Rosanne had a testimony she sent in I had it pulled up here but you know how these phones can be sometimes so but just wanted to read this this you can go ahead and have your seat this will take just a second and then I'm sorry have you stand upside down so much but read this testimony and then we'll read the other prayer request and we'll go right into prayer for but just wonderful prayer request uh wonderful testimony here from sister rosan she said uh here I'd like to share a testimony of God's incredible healing power last Thursday about 2 hours before church service I bent down and I pinched a nerve in my back the pain was excruciating and every move I made with my right hand arm leg or foot shent sent a sharp stabbing pain radiating from the center of my back despite the agony I attended Thursday night church serving uh church service praying fervently and trusting God to touch my body and bring healing yes sir although I experienced some relief during the service the pain persisted when I returned home for about two consecutive nights I was an absolute torment I was unable to sleep due to the pain would jol me awake it every just the slightest movement would jol me awake I had to work the next day but I was in so much pain that I could barely function relying solely on my left arm perform my duties as I cared for our resident she work in a nursing home right sister works in a nursing home I was desperate for Relief so I reached out to Sister Browning and asked her the number for a chiropractor she recommended Dr Brennan but unfortunately he was unavailable till Tuesday I couldn't wait that long because it the pain so I contracted another chiropractor joint chiropractor right on 58 and they too couldn't see me however they referred me to Dr Rick uh shiow and who saw me immediately after work he took x-rays diagnosed the pinch nerve and adjusted my back and neck he assured me that I should be feeling better the next day that same evening Sister Kim reached out to check on me unaware of my situation just to let me know that she loved me and that she was praying for me I decided to share my experience what was going on with her and she expressed her sympathy promising that she would pray for me the next day I returned to work but unfortunately there was no improvement uh in fact the pain seemed worse however I decided to push through I used both my hands despite the agony and pain Sister Kim checked in with me again that Saturday night and I updated her on my condition she reassured me that she'd been praying for me all day and we continued to do so that same Saturday night something happened as I turned in bed I realized the excruciating pain was gone I took deep breaths because before even deep breaths were causing immense pain so she takes a deep breath and while taking these deep breaths the pain just wasn't there discomfort but no pain I just knew that God had touched me praise God and I immediately thought of Sister Kim who had been praying for me and was the only one who knew about what had happened to me from my work I knew she prayed with me uh prayed for me with compassion and sympathy I could tell I recalled her own experiences with the kidney stones not too long ago and the immense pain that she had had to endure I believe that her prayers born out of her own understanding of suffering were the most powerful intercession I could have received and I wondered if God would had allowed Sister Kim to go through those trials so she could pray for me in my time of need maybe her experience was not just for her but for me as well so that I could receive my healing and victory I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to Sister Kim for her prayers of compassion I pray that God reward her with a life free from kidney stones from here on out and I thank her for being a vessel of God's healing power to know to flow freely into my life thank you sister Kim and God richly bless you amen amen praise God Amen Hallelujah how many's glad for God's healing power praise God he's still in the

ultimately he knows what what needs to be brought out of it and you know it's something how God we stand in amazement as a people of God how God can take one subject and we we've we've learned this by

giving us Grace that we could be in our right Minds Lord once again thank you for the weather Lord the way that's been made for us we thank you for a place that we can gather and Lord just where the word of God can go forth where we as a people Lord that you have redeemed through and by your blood a place that lives Lord might find rest and shelter under the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ that Lord you would speak to us and Lord minister to our lives that our lives Lord as we hear the word then the word coming in Lord and just Lord moving everything out that would be contrary and anything

Lord to be able to hear and to receive father we just give this service Lord into your hands now in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen amen if you'll turn with me let's go to 1 Corinthians chapter 12 and uh certainly ask you Lord Lord willing just to if you would keep us in prayer the meetings there with brother stepen um brother Isaac Hatfield will be here Lord willing on Sunday to minister amen for us and um Lord willing will will be ministering there with brother Steven's dedication meetings on Sunday morning so uh that is unless I can get be here and just tell him to stream it there so but we appreciate brother Stephen and it's just a he's such been such a blessing to us and I I feel we got cheated in February when he was here and uh not able to to speak uh but we are God knows all things and so we want to just continue to keep them in prayer amen I want to read here without any further delay beginning in verse one and Paul said now concerning spiritual gifts Brethren I would not have you ignorant you know that you were Gentiles carried away unto these dumb Idols even as you were LED wherefore I give you to understand that no man speaking by the spirit of God calleth Jesus a cursed and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost now there are diversities of gifts but the same spirit and there are differences of administrations but the same lord and there are diversities of operations but it is the same God which worketh all in all but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all or to profit all amen may God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I'd just like to take just a a thought here tonight and that is the other spiritual gifts and um I'm not I tonight I'm just going to take one of them and I just just really have so enjoyed the study upon the different gifts coming down through here and uh I think that would be probably tonight would serve us well to be able to get through one gift with some of the things I want to lay in here in the beginning and uh I certainly have been enjoying the things that the Lord has been uh speaking to our hearts you know the one thing about it when the word comes it just it comes to bring further Clarity and Direction amen man to our lives and to our hearts and so we when we look at this because so often and so much of the time is you know we spent about three services and I'm not altogether finished I want to deal with another part of that when we've been looking uh with the gifts and just and just looking at some things within maturity but I want to cover this first because uh many of the times we like I said when we think of gifts and a lot of times when I think is stated when individuals will bring up certain quotes and things of the prophet and say well you know the the nine spiritual gifts ought to be in the church but I think many times what is in is in a person's mind is that of tongues and that of Prophecy and the reason that would be even very natural and very common because Paul when he dealt with the Corinthian Church how many scriptures and how much did he deal with tongues and prophecy and like such of these other GI gift we're going to deal with there's a portion of a scripture that is given to it but yet these gifts themselves are the best gifts and they're actually where we'll begin tonight is with that of of what is the prophet calls the best gift that gift which is is the best out of it all and is absolutely the necessity out of it all but I want to just draw back to our our scripture here tonight think things that we I know when we go through this and we read through it and when we look at this that we read here in our text to know that there are diversities of gifts of how that gifts themselves that would be such a variety you can think about whether you even to think of just kitchen tools you can think of even as I had those office tools stapler tape and all those things like that they're they're so diverse what each one is needed for And So within all of it everything even within the gifts that God has set within the body they are so diverse in other words God if he wanted it all if all that he needed would have been tongues then that's all he would have given but God seemed fit to it to give you and I nine spiritual gifts now the prophet says it in this way he says you know God he said he gave us his word and he said now if it was me if I gave you my word and you didn't believe it he said well that would be it he said but that's not God God gave us five ministerial offices those are predestinated gifts that come from God from his forn knowledge of God and God gave that to go into the word to begin to you know break into a channel for what purpose to build our faith to see whatever we have need of it's already finished and then the prophet would say it like this again he said and then if we still can't get it that way he said God has set nine spiritual gifts in the church because he's interested in us getting it now I'll say it in this way brother Bram takes it up in the message Oneness also in marriage of the lamb and he speaks of how that you know when a h a young lady would be uh here she is courting and then you know here she would receive uh an engagement ring and brother Bram types that engagement ring that she would receive as that of the gifts that is given to the church and the reality of it is is that God let me just say it in this way you and I by the grace of God not by any goodness of our own or any of our own merits but it was predestinated by God as the prophet said when he speaks there in the church age book and he says this this special Revelation is built for a special class of people and let me just say it that takes that takes all all of our credibility away if I can say that it puts it all on the grace of God we're living in the time and the hour we're in and God has seen to it that you and I would be able to walk with a real truess and ass aury of our heart and that we as his bride we receive like that of that engagement ring we receive every gift that God has for us I'll just say it to you like this there might be a lot of things that you know where Satan is always trying to get in and trying to bring scarecrows and everything but let me just tell you no matter what has taken place no matter what false or no matter what this God gave the word and if God gave the word then he's big enough to watch over it and so we don't have to go into fear and lock things up and close it off but if we just if we just you know in a manner of just being in prayer and just and just let God let the word itself so place things and place our lives then you know what God will do what God sees fit to be done and one thing that's different about our lives and our hearts how we thank God for the gifts we thank God for everything and all that he does and I've said this to you as as your pastor to me I believe in all that God has for us there's not one thing going to be taken from me it's not going to be taken as long as I'm the pastor it's not going to be taken from this church I believe in prayer lines I believe in speaking in tongues I believe in Prophecy I believe in everything that God has given I believe in shouting I believe in everything I believe in Liberty in the house of God is that right we we believe in that because the word of God has come into a place and to bring a liberty in our hearts but there's one thing about it that we see the value of is that we could have like Paul says I can have all of these gifts and not just tongues and prophecy but I can have the gift of knowledge I could have the gift of wisdom I could have all these gifts but if I miss the most important thing Divine love which is the Holy Ghost I've missed it all and so to understand that part of it that we understand that not one of these gifts is an Evidence of a life being filled with the spirit of God but the prophet said it in this way he says I will say that the manifestation of the spirit that it is an evidence that the spirit is there manifesting through a vessel but we know what the true evidence is the Bible said when the spirit of Truth is come he'll lead and guide us into all truth it's when the spirit of God has brought an absolute New Creation on the inside and the amen is from your soul yes it that's the real evidence of the Holy Ghost that has never changed through the word and that evidence is to be able to receive the word and you say how do I know I'm receiving it because it lives out through your life Hallelujah there's nothing within that would disagree with the word of God that's the real true evidence aive because remember the word word itself is not is not altogether the Bible but the word is the person of Jesus Christ it is the Holy Ghost and that's why when we look at in the Scripture it says that there are three that agree in one the water and the blood and the spirit they agree in one we can be justified without being Sanctified we can be Sanctified without being filled with the Holy Ghost but you but but we can't be filled with the Holy Ghost and not have the others that are before that this is why John would say that there are three uh that that that these three are one the Father the word and the spirit so this is why that a person can never ever claim to be spirit filled they they can but we if they're spirit filled and yet resist and reject the word that's an Evidence coming out that's saying something different and this is why over and over through the message of the hour which it's all scripture that once that of the holy spirit is come that that soul will punctuate every word with amen because we're living in the hour of the amen so then when we recognize this the great difference even within our lives is that even when God would send eler and he would go under the direction of Abraham to get a bride and when he went to go and get a bride he he followed the wisdom and the and the leadership that Abraham gave and he prayed according to how Abraham told him of what he was to do and here comes Rebecca and when Rebecca came on the scene remember they begin to speak and they begin to talk and and then finally she declares who she is and when she declares who she is this is where elaser begins to worship oh that God has been merciful to my master how that God is so directed eleazer into that place that it wasn't something that he had to go through a phone book he didn't have to you know hit Instagram he didn't have to do you know a survey on Facebook he didn't H he he didn't have to do that he just had to be led by the Holy Ghost and when he came there remember he they you know he made known to to them to her parents and so forth and Brethren that you know uh you know the damsel uh I you know please let me have leave and and bring her with me uh to my master uh you know his son Isaac and and you know and how that when when they said well no just just wait 10 days but he said no we we we don't have time to wait until the tribulation she's got to be ready to go now and so when when the call was given remember they said well let's just call her she's of age and so when now she comes and she says they asked her Rebecca what's your decision and she said I will go you know that that's the simplest thing decision is so powerful sometimes we we can we can uh allow things to be made so complicated you know all it takes for the word to start working in your life is to make a decision and to agree with the word and the word has a way of dis manling holds and fears and doubts and and all of that and and you know the thing of it is is that here she came and you know she got up on the camels and you know that she had watered and so forth but my point is is that eleazer gave gifts unto her Brethren and them and they were content with that but Rebecca knew that where those gifts come from there is one who is waiting for me there is one that has sent these gifts my way and that's the thing that is in tune with the bride of Jesus Christ that all of these gifts it ought to be one thing that I should see I should see him very clearly it's him that I want to see when everything is all said and done if God carries and and we and we are not privileged to be a part of that glorious morning that I believe is on us at any moment to think of it that whether it's at our last passing a breath but to think that what the glory is is not of any gift that's wor through our life or anything in that way but to know that standing there that as we have to come through that door I know him in the power of his resurrection that's the real Victory is to know him amen so then with these diversities of gifts you know there's so many uh of the of these gifts as we look at them and they're and they're always so diverse and that to think of it as the gifts are diverse even we as God's people are so diverse there's such a variety and God chose and ordained it that way even as Paul would call it where the spirit of God would be in tabernacling in a people of God he would call it the manifold wisdom of almighty God how that God is displayed in such a variety and you know we might think well this this brother's odd or this sister's odd but who knows they might think you're odd but let me just tell you like the prophet said regarding Solomon's Stone he said there was a temple he said there was a place in Solomon's Temple for every odd acting Stone there you go so if you think you're a little bit odd and the devil wants to try know you there's a place for you in the economy of God and you know we don't we didn't have to we don't have to push our way and fight our way the Bible said every man's gift maketh room for himself now I believe not only that scripture I don't only preach that scripture when it comes to the ministerial offices I believe that real gift on the inside is that Soul the prophet taught us about he said it's that soul and things that are to be that the spirit of God there's something there that the spirit of God is able to Quicken and agree with the word of God that's the real gift of God I'll tell you aren't you thankful the real gift makees room for itself we just let God have his way then God will make himself known am so there's differences also of administration you know different orders among the body of Believers and God has that setup you know God made it very clear to us you know that how he has set up even within the five ministerial offices sometimes we refer to it as fful Ministry and uh you know that's a term brother bam will use scoffield will use in the notes and and and recognizing that differences of administration we see that very clearly you know that's a very key point of the differences of administration because you know the thing of it is the prophet said when God sends the light of the hour he sends it through that messenger and then from that messenger come men that are Faithfully taught to carry that message on now I don't believe that Faithfully taught is sitting down at a chalkboard or a computer but I believe it's the spirit of God the same unction of the Holy Spirit I believe it's getting in the same vein and the same that's a privilege that you and I have not just as the ministry but as that word is being preached you and I are being brought in the channel of God's Own thoughts so then our own lives the way our lives are conducted are actually God's thoughts concerning his word being reflected and manifested in our life there's a difference of administration in recognizing God has that profit for the age and then the rest of the ministry in this age that we're in God sent the prophet of Malachi 4 to anoint Ephesians 4 and this is why that every true Ministry look God has not put the ministry is not on the same plane the ministry has come under Ephesians 4 comes under Malachi 4 because when Aaron and the priest were to come and worship remember they had to come before Moses and Moses had to wash them right and he had to clothe them with the wisdom that God had given is that right so now what would be coming forth and that washing is the washing of Water by the word it's washing away our ideas washing away our thinking but you know what how beautiful it is when we're right in our position you know what I'm so thankful to me when I look at that I I don't want that position I'm just grateful to be under the ministry that God has given us just like every other age what a place of safety it is to abide Under The Canopy of God's word and you know what I mean by that you don't have to try to figure nothing out no it's just like this I I'm just going to say this when brother bam you know sometimes you know individuals can get this and they take it way off you know uh and brother R says you know take the things you're hearing and take it back to the scripture now he's not telling us you know be careful because I might be a deceiver there might be some things that's what he's speaking to us about is because this is a scriptural Prophet that is announcing to you and I to get into the same channel of thought because God what is a prophet that is a chip off of the diamond that gets made into a vrola needle that gets put on a record to release what's been canned in that record and God sends a prophet down then it's not the prophet in him s it is God's gift and God through that releases his thoughts that's been sealed in the word differences of administration and those are things that for us by God's grace that God gives us the the the ability to be able to recognize those different Administration those boundaries that God would set there you know within within a protection there's differences of operations and Paul would write this that let every man prophesy according to the proportion of faith that he's given God's given to everyone a measure is that right and so to recognize that you know God's the one that he's the one that that that determines even the extent of that gift being operated and let me just say it to you like this God can have a Ministry and that Ministry itself might be one that might be used once every so many years then God will have you know a gift that maybe you know may maybe it's a pastor and God might utilize that gift to minister in other places but God may not do that to to each and every one does that make anyone above one another not at all it's God that set these differences of of operation so it's not man that determines this now I will say this to you that you know sometimes uh humanness and and so forth can get in there and that's why Paul said let don't be striving for vain Glory you know in other words pushing and trying to you know VI like that like electioneering for a position that's where it comes back every man's gift will make room for itself and you know what here is the beauty of it is what God is whatever God has called you and I to do if we'll operate within that there is a peace there is a rest there is safety there is protection because what it is it's abiding within God's will for our lives and then we find this of the the manifestation of the spirit and and you know it's all the everything that Paul would write about it's all for the edification of the body it's not to satisfy uh somebody's uh you know feeling of spirituality no the manifestation of the spirit is given for the profit of all or that the body itself would be profited and so God you know this is the thing that God will do uh because the five ministerial gifts those are for ordained by God man comes here here well if he's a pastor he came here with that gift in him if he's a Prophet come here with that gift in him any part of of the ministry but the nine spiritual gifts are in the body and the prophet said it can be on this one tonight and never again and then you'll hear Brother Brown say in the message you'll hear him I've read to you some quotes where he's talking about how God was using Brother Neville and then he'll talk about brother Hig and Bam and then he'll talk about Junior Jackson and and he'll speak of them and you know how they have you know this this gift of speaking in tongues and so forth but you know what it comes down to is is no matter what it is whether it's one of the nine spiritual gifts or five ministerial you know God will will will entrust you and I with something and then he'll stand back and watch our conduct with it he wants to see how that we'll handle it because this is the very thing now this is exactly what brother bamy goes into bringing that out God will watch that conduct because everything must be kept to where that he's glorified amen and so God oh I'm glad he watches over that aren't you I'll just tell you right right up front if there God seen something within me that was not glorifying him I'd say Lord take me take me down take me down correct me take me down lord I don't want anything that takes away from you because you know why when you and I leave out of this building from these times that we gather you've got to face real issues in life right you've got questions that are before you've got needs with family and whatever more we need to see the Lord Jesus we need to hear from him we we we don't have time friends for personalities we only have time for one and that's God I I I think I pray God let that be the fading out in this hour from every personality and let us only see Jesus so when we look at this of how that a diamond itself the prophet says you know God's like a great big diamond and that diamond has been chipped or it's cut in such a way a true cut diamond reflects many rays of light and when we see in the church so many different gifts of the Spirit it's only the Reflection off of the real diamond and one may seem a little peculiar to the other but it's the way the diamond reflects the light so God does that also in the way he reflects a gift in the Bible one as a gift of knowledge one as a gift of tongues another as a gift of something else but it's God reflecting these lights and they are lights that's gathered in one person and that's almighty God now brother B goes on and talking about this in many places about the diamond and he's just he's showing us how that you know that it it reflects it's just it's the same coming from the same source as as I just read it's God reflecting through these lights but brother Bram would speak to us there in the message gifts and he says concerning he said even among the Pentecost OST he said these is where this is where individuals have got the gifts mixed up because they have put an emphasis on certain gifts and said if you do this then you got it if you do this then you got it and they've put that that they put those emphasis up on those things and that's where things were mixed up but let me just tell you something God knew what was coming in this hour God knew that he would restore and isua Street was not the restoration of the word it was not the long promised restoration but Aus stre was the restoration of the gifts right the supernatural moving Among Us once again but remember there are four messengers of death that ate away the tree in Joel chapter 2 and there's four messengers of life and that fourth one is the evening light it is Christ himself come down and making himself known not only through the ministry of Malachi 4 but now it's Christ impersonated in his bride once again where it is no longer two but these two have become one Hallelujah God himself has announced it there through that of the message where God spoke through the prophet in that of God hiding and revealing himself in Simplicity and the prophet said my first Duty for coming out of here was to marry a couple there in the back oh he says I trust that that is a type of what that God has called me to do in this last day think of it it's the announcement it's the call to the temple of God and then he steps forward that night to announce the breach what is the breach the breach is Christ himself the holy spirit that ties you and I back in to our inheritance it's Christ coming into his Temple amen am amenu Oh Glory and in his Temple is just like it was back there they had Snuffer dishes they had all of these utensils gifts that were needed for service and God has all of these in the body of Jesus Christ don't you love him for that is't that beautiful how God has it all put together oh my you know all of these things it comes to serve one great purpose this is why with the scripture I'm just going to give you a few scriptures here the Bible said he that he in John 7 that would believe on me had the scripture said out of his belly shall flow Rivers pearl of Living Water one in Psalms chapter 1 and verse three talking about this blessed man he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water Rivers non-spiritual gifts flowing out of the one same Source the same God and you you know you would look at that and the prophet as he goes into that and restoration the brid tree but I remember we've always got to keep in mind what are these gifts for because remember Satan is always tempting he tempted the Lord Jesus to try to get him to clown for him you say what do you mean by clown well I'm not talking about putting on a bozo suit with with a red nose but I'm talking about Satan was wanting him to do what he wanted him to do but the Lord Jesus though in the midst of Temptation he stood on the word of God and I want to just say it in this way that how God knows that within this hour there is a people on Earth that this is the brid tree that God had promised that he said I will restore where Satan himself when he ate he be to start on this right after the day of Pentecost it went for for a space of years there and then by the time it got to the Ephesian age she was already a fallen woman Satan had be to eat on that fruit and then he went from the fruit and took on the leaves and then he tried then he stripped the doctrine he can get into the life but the thing of it is that Satan ate all of that away but he forgot one thing you cannot stop the word from coming back and reproducing itself cu the life is in the roots and God said I will restore all not just some of it all amen he won't just be you know look like a Pentecostal Church of you know how it was back there in Acts two and you know like some rebuilt car that may have a a Ford motor and has a Chevy hood and that's not what God promised God promised that this bride would be hitting on 16 cylinders she would be a word bride through and through she would have she would have a word engine on the inside amen her life would be built and founded on God's holy word all the way through he said I will restore all the years and God has restored his word in this hour and the restoration of the word does not do away with the gifts among the body amen man's idea can do that but not God's word am but neither does man's theology exalt the gifts it's got its place the ministry that God has sent in this hour we recognize when there's a need then we move by the spirit of God and God will see fit to it to give us what we have need of abolutely thank you Lord oh friends that's why this seven seal the prophet said it's a relaxing time right are you hearing me we've entered into the rest of God that doesn't mean that you know somehow that we just you know like throwing confetti up in the air no it means that recognizing that God he has watched over our life all along it's God that has made a way time and time again it is God sovereignly that has known our need it is God that has ministered over our life and then to recognize wait a minute I didn't make none of this happen I didn't search myself it was not I who found this message it's not I who changed my life you know what when you begin to rehearse those things and remember it was God that brought you out of the iron furnace then you know what that does when you see it in that way you understand his miracles cuz you are one of his miracles Hallelujah and you're able to walk there's with there's a rest and you know what a rest is it's a confidence what is a confidence it's a faith and what is Faith built on love trust hallelujah hallelujah that is so good oh don't you love him God sent these gifts because he's there is fruit in this tree that's to be made manifest let me tell you the fruit is the fruit of the word and so God the purpose that he sent these these gifts is to keep the church clean amen am you know what God said I'm going to I'm placing this in there I can speak through them through my word I can speak through them through when they're Reading Writing devotion they're listening to the message in the cool of their room but I have set this there that just in case something gets a little off along the way I have set for my bride nine spiritual gifts because if something gets out of the way I know their desire is to please me and to bring forth fruit unto God so God himself is responsible amen and over his body oh brother we're not under denominational order no sir we're not under the isms of man we're under the leadership of the pillar of fire Hallelujah let me tell you we're under the same leadership that what it was when they came out of Egypt and Moses needed to know what to do the prophet said where Moses got all that he needed his leadership he got it out of that logos Pillar of Fire and he brought that down and it gave leadership to the people oh my I'm so glad that God speaks to our hearts aren't you I'm glad that God gives leadership to our lives so here we come 4 to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom notice the word of wisdom so a Word of Wisdom that is given that remember it's not remember even with all of these gifts from tongues prophecy all of them it's not about what we think the prophet even said it like this when it come to a gift of healing he said many times I would look at somebody and say oh God I want to just go pray for them and that they would get well he said but the Holy Spirit would not allow me to do it and he would direct me over to this one and it may not even be that that serious of a need and you say where is that in the scripture it was at the pool of Bethesda Jesus stepped over one stepped over another stepped over another went to a man who had a condition that wasn't going to kill him oh brother and sister you know if we can just step back and look at that you see God's sovereignty in it all look God knew right where you and I were laying he knew right where you and I were at brother I'm glad this is not the compassion of of human I believe in human compassion I thank God for human compassion but I'm grateful for the compassion of God and you know what it is it's the compassion according to his word by election I'm grateful for the compassion of God that yes stretched out for those who would not even believe in Divine Healing but God would provide medicine and doctors that is so good I tell you you talking about love you talking about love that could stand there for people said I don't even believe in God and God desire to help Humanity in such a way oh my Hallelujah oh but a word of wisdom so it's not our thoughts it's not our thinking it's not man's thoughts it's a word of wisdom and there's only one true source of this kind of wisdom amen now remember the Bible tells this in Ezekiel chapter 28 that Satan was full of wisdom as well but Satan's wisdom is a deviation from the word of God is that right Satan's cunning and and and you know th way I mean look look look look look this is why the prophet said that within it all even all of these gifts not just tongues not just interpretation not just prophecy but even a Word of Wisdom when it comes down to it at the end of the day we must have the Holy Ghost that's what matters at the end of the day and so to understand that that the wisdom of God when it comes down it's never going to lead you away from God's word is that right God even told him in Deuteronomy 13 there can be prophets that will they will show signs and wonders and they'll hit right on the mark but he said if they then watch what comes out of their mouth if it seeks to take you away from the word it's a false prophet I don't care how I don't care how punctual the signs and wonders are you listen to the teaching of the word by their fruits their teaching you shall know them that's why the prophet said in the Harvest Time think of this think of this title 1964 Satan can hand out gifts by the handfuls wow now A Word of Wisdom everybody ready the prophet says if you'll notice the routine of the gifts the first is a gift of wisdom the first is the gift of wisdom that is the best gift of the group if you don't if we don't have wisdom we won't know how to use knowledge it's the second gift that's now let me just lik it in this way there's things no doubt that every one of us have let things slip out of our mouth and we could said I wish I'd have had some wisdom over that knowledge wouldn't have said it at that time wouldn't have said it in that way we had knowledge but it's wisdom we want wisdom to be over the knowledge this is why God gave wisdom it's the first gift that he even talks about now he says if we can't use the second gift without wisdom how are we going to use the last gift of interpretation or the next or the last speaking in tongues our Zeal has eat up our wisdom and our Zeal for our denominations and our enthusiasm now listen don't let that word denominations trip you up denominations is a framework of thinking this is where this is where even in a even in a way of thinking of well this is the way I look at it and this is the way and and then watch watch here's one thing we can disagree but there's another thing that if when we disagree and then things begin to lead away from the word by reasoning that's no longer just something that we don't see and disagree there's somewhere along the line we never want to be led away from the word denominations did not start in some school somewhere it starts with a deviation from the word and so our our Zeal for our denominations and our enthusiasm has eat up the wisdom off the vine brotherly love oh Lord have mercy what does Brotherly Love have to do with it everything you know what Brotherly Love is being able to put yourself in the other person's shoes who's wronged you that's a direct quote statue of a perfect man that's what Brotherly Love Is is being able to do that now let's just be honest there's not one of us in our natural abilities that really would have the level to be able to do that outside of it being by the spirit of God and even then it's a wrestling that goes on but you know what he already prevailed in one Garden that was only a sign he was going to Prevail in this Garden is that right the word will have its way glory be to God that's why how the word comes in in Revelations 10 8-1 it comes down into the garden there's a oh there's a churning going on a wrestling match that's going on but remember he will prevail yes he will amen there's an Abel buried beneath that can is that right oh man there's an Israel that's greater than your Esau glory be to God notice that it eat up the Zeal eat up wisdom the Zeal what Zeal it's it's going after things it's doing this without the wisdom of God but God knowing what we have need of he says the first gift in the line of gifts is wisdom the second is knowledge and if you don't have wisdom how do you know what to do with knowledge seek the best things first wisdom and if you ain't got wisdom what can you do with knowledge speaking in tongues or these other things it takes wisdom it takes God's wisdom and Solomon said call it your mother he says what did they do the Pentecost was received speaking in tongues and they made a denomination out of it and they went and said this is it I mix multitude with them now think about the time that we are living in in this hour we're living in the Time of Our God has called a people out of denominationalism now God couldn't call you and I out of denominationalism by denominational ISM right right but it had to be the free word it had to be the word himself he was put out right he was put out and here he is on the outside and and he here he is knocking you know here at at at the door but now it's turned to individuals because the church put him out so God is calling individuals out he's calling Our Lives to be open unto him and notice if he's calling us out out he's going to take us into something the scripture said in Luke Luke 17 it said as it was in the in the days of lot coming out and right so shall it be in the days of the son of man and as it was in the days of Noah it was a coming out and a going in so God is calling us out of see this is why that if somebody wants to call you out and you know run down whether it's church or run down the message ask them what they have for you instead amen right where are you taking me don't be just taking me to to just you know follow your little way no where are you going to where are you taking me to show me that'll say a lot right there and if they say freedom what you realize and know is that they have been in bondage the whole time because they never did get the new birth and the Commandments of God first John chapter 5 the Commandments of God were Grievious unto them that's are you hearing now I'm not sliding God can reach down and turn their life right around but let me just tell you something I have no desire to go back to what God brought me out of I don't have no desire look the bridges have been burnt I don't got things saved in the closet just in case you know I better keep these like you know the prophet says that we hang them up in the closet just in case I don't have the goods that's not listen you just let God listen if you're here tonight in that place say God burn it out of my heart because he burns it out of your heart don't worry you'll get it out of your closet is that all right you see that it works with the inside God Will Take Care it takes care of the inside it'll it'll come off it'll work its way to the outside but that is wisdom of how that God would move among us to bring us out and to bring us in this is why the scripture says that Joshua was full of the spirit of wisdom because this ministry it's a placing in the body and so it's looking at remember oh my you you have this gift or you do this or or they'll say oh no you don't do anything I don't want to be like you yeah be very careful because those that you that may not be visible they may never stand on this stage at any point but let me just tell you something are the nuts and bolts that's right that hold this thing together in prayer are you hearing me brother BR said the success of my meetings and pulled back that curtain and those that were praying I'm not saying those that stand up here don't have a part but I'm just saying is is don't despise the day of small things that's right what God has called called you to do is a vital part and nobody can take your place but Satan wants to try to minimize things and be like this and be like that but the spirit of wisdom helps us to recognize what God has for us and let him Place us where he wants us to operate because we'll never be a success anywhere else other than what God has called us to operate is that right so to understand that that part of it that when God has placed and and bring brings these forth all in its time this is why that we need that Spirit of wisdom Solomon asked for wisdom every time through through the all of the quotes that I have studied with this just isolating gift of wisdom and gift of healing and then you know breaking it up into different words so that it's not grouped and just going through every time the prophet will come back to this this of wisdom that God gave to Solomon now I just want you to understand this we see this he wasn't born with this wisdom sir but when he saw the task that was before him God God placed here his father in his life and his father told him this is what you need to ask for and it had to be something that was just more than him repeating words something had to drop in Solomon's heart that he could see the burden and the need and he realized dear Lord right I'm I'm unfit to do this on my own I mean think about it it's overwhelming I don't know how you felt but I mean I felt like you know you you've come to that place you know here when you get married you think oh dear lord I you know I thought I had all the p's and q's together and you go along and you realize oh wait a minute I don't and and you you know why because it's it's schooling right that's right you could read all the books to your blue in the face oh absolutely right it's like you could read all the journal abstracts about you know about uh parent in and doing this and doing that but when Boots get on the ground that's when you have to live it out right and I'm not saying that there's nice little things that we can draw from little things and little articles and and those things here and there that we come but we recognize God I need wisdom right hey isn't that what manoah asked he said ask the angel to his wife to come back ask that man to come back Hallelujah and he came back and he asked him how shall we order this child's life that is so you see what he was looking for it man had all these Ambitions and all these things of man here's a child and you know what we're going to do with him and with this or her or whatever more but then God makes known it's a him God didn't get his pronouns mixed up either that's right he's clear all right that's right and and notice he asked him and said what how shall we order his life oh my you see this is what listen I'm not saying we don't need teaching of the word we do I believe in teaching of the word and I believe that as we're praying and we're asking God for wisdom and Direction our life this is just one of the small channels that God can work through he can come right in your prayer closet he can come right while you're listening to the message he can come right through another brother or sister that you're unsuspecting that's why you don't want to try to put him in a box you might try to put him in a box and get all discouraged and walk out in the vesb and God's Got the Word of Wisdom that you need and you're walking out there having to care of your bottom lip oh he he didn't read the right text and God you didn't you know Lord you didn't and and God's got it all in control he's got it all in control so notice he asked God this is I need wisdom I need wisdom and understanding to lead this people amen and he asked God for that with this in mind Unity amen that it would be wisdom because the wisdom that comes from god it works to hold together in unity to the promise is that right and this is where that when we see this that you know Solomon you can read this later on you Bible readers you're familiar with it in First Kings chapter 3 you know in verse 9 he wrote about requesting this and you know because in Solomon I mean it it must have hit him and I think it continued to hit him as he went on but because you know why we're dealing with humanity and listen friends even with the attribute of God in our life that attribute is still surrounded by humanity and there is diverse matters that at times in the humanness of life that can be entangling complicated and don't even have a black and white answer we need wisdom that's so true you see many times God's people do not get in trouble with black and white where we need help is with the gray areas that's where Satan wants to try to come in and snag and trap and punch and and that's why the word comes to expose where Satan has wanted to ens snare Us in Gray areas amen that's so good now let's look at Solomon here just for a moment in First Kings 3 and verse 16- 23 I I'm not going to put this one up there but I just want to refer to it remember there two women who came they were harlots they both had given birth at the same time that's right and one of them went to sleep or rolled over on their child and their child died so in the middle of the night the one whose child died went over and took the other one her child and replaced it with her dead child right and then when this one woke up she looked at that and said this isn't mine this isn't mine 't there something mama knows which ones are hers boy Lord Jesus isin't it something that mother our New Jerusalem that Holy Spirit that we are born of that great Eagle of God he knows who belongs to him Hallelujah he knows his hallu that's why this message keeps going and keeps going listen friends that's why it's went into our lives it might have hit first your human spirit and here mama Eagle said no no that's not it there's my Eagles down there on the inside and Mama Eagle that quickening power kept dealing with that son and daughter of God on the inside to do what call you out of this Pond of mud that we were put in and what comes out a Lily and what are lies what are the flowers of the lies it speaks of [Applause] [Music] Resurrection my my glory so Solomon this dispute has come up so Solomon looks and he says bring me a sword speak it to the two women bring me a sword they brought a sword before the king and the King said divide the living child in two give half to the one half to the other then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king for her bows yearned upon her son and she said oh my Lord give her the living child and in no wise slay it but the other said let it be neither mine nor thine but divided then the king answered and said give her the living child and in no wise slay it she is the mother thereof the one who said give it give it to her that's whose child that is what was that a word of wisdom a situation that we did not have something to go by here turn toap after so and so how do I be baptized no it wasn't written this wasn't written there this was a situation that came up amen that we needed a word of wisdom so notice brother Brams talks about this and I love just let me just read this a little bit he said when Solomon the son of David when he took the throne well he never prayed that God would give him so much but just wisdom to know how to govern and hold hold the people together that's what the real wisdom of God the real wisdom of God isn't isn't you know showing or displaying it's for one purpose Lord Grace that the people might be helped governed and held together holding to the promise of God no wonder the prophet said how that the pastor himself it should be the wisdom operating in his life cuz he tells us over here in the message of the absolute he's got to have an absolute that he holds over that congregation an absolute of the reality of Jesus Christ he tells us in power of transformation he said it takes the leadership of the Holy Spirit to keep a group of people together in harmony and let me just tell you that ain't no easy task it takes the leadership of the Holy Spirit not a Tutti Frutti not a sweet powder sugary guy it takes the leadership of the Holy Spirit are you with me it and to for what purpose holding to the message of the hour amen because Satan's all listen Satan's distractions is to try to get you away from your Liberty from the message that he'll use any little thing that's where you want to that's where we want to discern him now notice within this and let's bring it down here just for a few moments here in the local body you know Paul would write of this of and he speaks to the Corinthian Church and he said dare any of you having a matter against another go to law before the unjust and not before the Saints do you not know that the Saints shall judge the world and if the world shall be judged by you are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters know ye that we shall judge Angels how much more that pertain to this life if then you have judgments of things pertaining to this life set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church and he said I speak this to your shame is it so that there's not a wise man man among you know not one that shall be able to judge between his brethen now you say brother Samuel that says judge and judges also to discern and the prophet tells us that even with this a Word of Wisdom he said that discernment works right with it but brother goeth to law with Brethren that before unbelievers he said that's an utterly a fault among you because you go to law with one another why do you not rather take wrong why why do you not rather just post it on Instagram no they don't say that why don't you rather just suffer yourselves to be defrauded nay you do wrong and defraud and that your brother it just becomes endless cycle right two wrongs don't make a right is that right I know that's a simple saying but it's true it's a simple one but you notice Paul he he would write of this because there's situations that would arise that we would need a Word of Wisdom there's situations that AR rise that even like brother Brandon mentions here and I've read this quote to you I'm not going to do it again tonight but he speaks of how when somebody would come and say you know what job or what church do I take do I take this church or do I take that church and and brother Brandon would just tell us he said well that's something that's going to have to come through another ministry that's something now God can use tongues he can use interpretation he use he can use whatever gift but look with even in this right here sometimes these are things right here that are not seen seemed to be so spiritual let me tell you I've watched God work through the word of wisdom and you know at the time it didn't maybe all of a sudden seem so spiritual but you watch how God things that God would speak and say and things would come to pass and work right out I was talking with brother Brian here just uh I don't know if it was a couple weeks ago or whatever he was at the house for the youth meeting or pick a kids up and we were talking about when he had he had two jobs he was between and uh you know he he liked both jobs but actually one he wanted a little bit more and you know we're sitting there and I'm just going to tell you you you know this right now I'm not going to make nothing up I don't I don't have to put on nothing for nobody and I'm going to just tell you a pastor is not a prophet I know sometimes that can get people they they they can get spoiled and think it's got to you got to show a vision way if God wants to do that he can do that yeah if God wants to show a dream he can do that God wants to do he can do that however God whatever is is needed in that moment but then again there's things that you can come to and you just have to say you know what let's just pray about it and we I remember at the the latter part of we were sitting right there we actually sitting over in the conference room at the time and we were sitting there and you know I didn't know what to tell him we I listened to the situation and all of a sudden and I don't even know how now how together how it all came out but it came out in such a way of what a fleece of what to be laid before that company uh the next day and you know what I got a call the next day and here he was he's like hey they said they would pay for this insurance up to this part and they would do this and they would do that you know God knows what we have need of when we have need of it now God didn't have to do that in a back room you know with with just us together he could have gained that answer right across here but it's not up to us to determine that but I'm also glad that God is so mindful that he won't just say you didn't get it through the preaching of the word tough luck wow that's so good that's not God God is interested in helping his people he's interested let me tell you something he's more interested than sometimes when we've just thrown in the towel on something that we've been praying about but let me just tell you you might have felt like you threw in the towel but let me remind you Daniel The First Time You Prayed he heard your answer might be held up but the answer's on the way and God's Got reinforcements to come your way that's right that's right right woo glory to God man I'm glad God's not like us and says that's it befriended no but he said I'm your friend you're my friend God calls us his buddies his bride but the wisdom is the best of the group that's so good the best I'm that that particular quote let me let me close on this Prophet would refer to these two scriptures in the Book of Revelations he said when he even makes that statement because how that God would say here is wisdom let him count the number of the Beast and I don't have to go through all the quotes with on that then notice verse 17 or 179 here is the mind which hath wisdom and brother Brandon would say it in this way he says now you find all through these Church ages here pulling out the Holy Spirit speaking how those gifts would be working in the last days we've got Gifts of healing working oh it's going good well brother there's other gifts that's just one of them that's just a little minor thing here's a here's a far greater gift right here which would be the best the gift of the Holy Ghost of wisdom to put the word of God together and to share show the church where we're standing than to just get somebody healed we said we all want to be well but I'd rather have my soul well than my body well anytime let me just say this to you that wisdom that God has given without me prolonging the time you can go into the Book of Daniel and it speaks of how God filled Daniel and the others with wisdom but Daniel had wisdom that was given by God that even the others didn't have that level of administration are you with me Daniel had a different a level of administration as the prophet in that time and God would speak to him even how the wisdom of God in Daniel when the king dreamed a dream and said which one of you astrologers can interpret this dream and they said well King tell us the dream y'all know the story tell us the dream he said yeah I'd give you the time you'd been making something up so he sent a decree right kill every one of them but here was a man that was full of wisdom and wisdom holds for Life tell the king don't be so Hasty there's a God who can reveal these [Applause] things you see what it is the gifts it's all about edifying it's about life edification to the church and here God gave Daniel that wisdom and remember man they just oh they thought Daniel they they even made an image wanted to worship Him and Daniel told him he said look God didn't give this to me has known that I'm more than anybody else God did it to preserve life can you run with me just a few moments God has given this end time Revelation to you and I to preserve our life for Rapture because we're not in the place of interpreting Daniel's image but we're in the hour the stone is fixing to come in and the prophet said God in his Mercy has sent a Ministry to catch while the Stone is coming in a catch of people away Hall call us out of that image unto the Beast call us out and we see the you big toes have already been here kof and isah Hower and God has sent a word wisdom Hallelujah life to lead us out to safety amen and you know what that's done in our life sister Rosanne you know what that's done in our life young Brothers you know what that's done in our life let me tell you what this wisdom coming down from God has done it has put the church in order amen it has put our lives in order as a matter of fact when God came down and he the wisdom of God said you ready get your instrument up getting ready to go and here's the symphony is on the scene and here is one who is in the original Spirit of the composer standing as a director under the inspiration and begins to take and the Symphony of God that's on Earth in that time begins to beat out in Harmony and in order and you got this one little guy in the back with these symbols he's waiting there waiting there waiting there waiting there waiting there he's got to wait there for 15 minutes he's he's waiting there waiting there but he knows his part his part might only be one but he's got his part and wisdom has brought his Zeal under subjection to the word of God and he realizes the word the order of the word has not Tak Tak away my Liberty but it has given me liberty in the freedom and boundaries and walls of the word of God hallelujah that's wisdom amen yes it is hallelujah let me tell you what this does it shows in your life 100% when the Queen of Sheba after all her questions was answered brother Brian she got up there and she watched even how the servants walked up the stairs she watched how they served meat things that we would think man it ought to be something grandiose if this is the wisdom of God these are people I mean these servants would be walking around and spitting out quotes left and right they would be talking Mysteries left and right the Mysteries have come they have been unfolded and you know what it's all about it's about you it's about you and Christ becoming one it's about Christ the wisdom of God taking preeminence in our life in our walk the way we conduct ourselves in our homes the way we want act with one another we are taking our position yes Hallelujah by the wisdom of God abely you love him absolutely let's pray heavenly father thank you for your mercy tonight Lord father we thank you for Lord just your loving kindness to us your mercy your grace Lord to speak to our lives in such a personal way thank you Father we Lord oh my we see the blessing the effect of this of the wisdom of God coming Among Us Lord I'm so thankful that there's a Word of Wisdom amen that not only you've delivered to the Church of the Living God but the spirit

in here Lord may we lord I pray those that even would be listening under the sound of my voice Lord father truly we never put anything any evidence upon any any gift but Lord May our lives this is

things together like a puzzle where we're trying to beat one piece together and make this fit and make that fit no that's not how it works lord it's not our wisdom it's your wisdom just like the prophet told us Lord with tongues and interpretation it's not our thoughts it's God's thoughts that moves down and speaks there through Us in another language then it is God's thoughts that catch and
