[37:50] august 1st happy anniversary
[37:53] amen
[38:02] i can't hear you it's a few more years
[38:04] of being soon
[38:06] amen the word of god speak as a pastor
[38:09] come to me
[38:10] where did god speak
[38:13] would you pour down like
[38:17] [Music]
[38:29] you're in this
[38:35] [Music]
[38:44] word of god's feet
[38:47] [Music]
[39:09] is
[39:13] [Music]
[39:32] it isn't a privilege to serve the lord
[39:35] amen it's a real
[39:38] no matter like the song that that i know
[39:40] somebody else wrote it but brother bill
[39:42] sings it god is good all the time
[39:45] and all the time god is
[39:48] good
[39:50] no matter what the situation is
[39:53] that's something that we have we have by
[39:55] the grace of god that the holy spirit
[39:58] the love of god is placed in our heart
[40:00] is the real joy of the lord
[40:03] it's not a joy that the world gives
[40:05] because that that joy fluctuates
[40:07] depending on how the nasdaq is doing and
[40:10] how the 401k is doing and how you know
[40:12] our bank accounts that that's the world
[40:16] but the joy of the lord is what sustains
[40:18] us
[40:20] through the midst of tests and trials
[40:21] even
[40:23] when we would get down in our spirit
[40:26] there's a joy within we've got ground
[40:29] and it's good ground
[40:31] to stand upon and to know that
[40:35] i am his
[40:36] and he is mine
[40:38] he's leading me through this
[40:40] that's real joy
[40:44] joy is not bubble dancing i i believe in
[40:46] dancing but real joy
[40:49] is that which is a constant all the way
[40:51] through our life it doesn't matter if
[40:53] the sun is shining or not
[40:55] we might like the sun to shine we might
[40:57] like certain seasons
[40:59] but the joy of the lord i'm so glad it's
[41:01] not dependent
[41:03] upon our
[41:04] feelings the joy of the lord
[41:07] is god
[41:09] himself
[41:11] that's why when nehemiah could speak to
[41:14] the people
[41:15] they would begin to
[41:17] weep and they'd begin to cry we believe
[41:19] the word should deal with our heart the
[41:21] correct way
[41:23] to come to god is first in repentance
[41:26] is that right
[41:27] but then as they begin to
[41:29] as they were crying then the spirit of
[41:30] god caught the transition
[41:33] and said
[41:34] this is a time of joy
[41:37] it's a time of the feast of the
[41:38] tabernacles and you realize right now
[41:40] we're living in the feast of tabernacles
[41:43] these are temporary
[41:45] dwellings
[41:47] is that right
[41:49] and it is the work of the joy of the
[41:51] lord who is our strength
[41:54] in our lives
[41:56] who stabilizes us

[47:19] jesus christ
[47:21] amen
[47:23] amen if you'll turn with me in the
[47:25] scriptures here
[47:26] to psalms 23
[47:36] psalms 23
[47:38] and a very familiar passage of scripture
[47:42] and i would like to read that entire
[47:45] passage of scripture
[47:47] before we're seated
[47:50] it says
[47:51] a psalm of david
[47:53] the lord
[47:54] is my shepherd
[47:57] i shall not want
[48:01] there's there's some mighty
[48:03] big words there but
[48:05] this is an experience
[48:07] david's declaring the experience
[48:11] from
[48:12] his heart
[48:14] the lord is
[48:16] my shepherd
[48:19] i shall not want i'm satisfied
[48:22] i'm content in him there's nothing
[48:24] that i want
[48:25] besides him
[48:28] and all that i have need of is found in
[48:30] him
[48:32] he maketh me
[48:34] to lie down in green pastures
[48:37] he
[48:38] leadeth me
[48:39] beside the still waters
[48:42] he
[48:43] restoreth my soul
[48:46] he
[48:47] leadeth me
[48:48] in the path of righteousness for his
[48:51] name's sake
[48:53] yea though i walk through the valley of
[48:55] the shadow of death
[48:57] i will fear
[48:58] no evil
[49:00] for thou art with me
[49:02] thy rod and thy staff they comfort me
[49:07] thy prepow preparest a table before me
[49:12] in the presence of my enemies
[49:14] thou anointest my head with oil
[49:18] my cup runneth over
[49:21] surely goodness and mercy
[49:23] shall follow me all the days of my life
[49:27] and i will dwell
[49:29] in the house of the lord
[49:31] forever
[49:33] amen may god bless you and bless the
[49:35] reading of the word as you're being
[49:36] seated
[49:39] and wonder if you turn with me i think i
[49:41] have it on the screen as well
[49:44] in john chapter one and verse one and i
[49:46] want to just read these scriptures
[49:49] to lay some background of some
[49:52] what we'll try to move into here this
[49:54] morning
[49:58] and i'd like to speak here on a thought
[50:03] and i just i gave the brothers the title
[50:06] the lord is my shepherd
[50:08] but i would like to also if i could have
[50:10] a subtitle in that
[50:12] who is your king
[50:15] who is your king
[50:21] and john 1 1
[50:24] in the beginning was the word
[50:27] and the word was with god
[50:30] and the word
[50:32] was
[50:33] god
[50:35] not something separate
[50:37] not something different
[50:39] but the word
[50:41] was god
[50:43] the same was in the beginning with god
[50:45] and all things were made
[50:47] by him
[50:48] and without him was not anything made
[50:52] that was made in him was life
[50:56] and the life was the light of men
[51:00] in first john chapter 5 verse 6 if i may
[51:03] read that as well first john 5 6
[51:07] this is he
[51:09] that came by water and blood
[51:12] even jesus christ
[51:15] not by water only but by water and blood
[51:18] let me just stop here for a moment if he
[51:21] came only by water we're still in our
[51:24] sins
[51:26] there's no way of escape but john
[51:30] under the under the unction of the holy
[51:32] spirit is declaring
[51:35] there has come a perfect blood that is
[51:38] not
[51:39] contaminated
[51:41] of the fall
[51:42] but this is the blood of god peter
[51:45] records it the blood of christ
[51:49] is that right
[51:50] john writes it in john 1
[51:53] who has loosed us
[51:55] from our sins
[51:57] how could there be a loosening not by
[51:59] water only
[52:01] but by water
[52:02] and by blood
[52:04] not of the blood that was already here
[52:07] from the fall contaminate but god
[52:10] created
[52:11] a blood cell
[52:13] in order to satisfy the ransom for you
[52:18] and i
[52:22] this is he that came by water and blood
[52:24] even jesus christ not by water only but
[52:27] by water and blood and it is the spirit
[52:31] that beareth witness because the spirit
[52:33] is truth for there are three
[52:37] that bear record in heaven the father
[52:40] the word and the holy ghost can you read
[52:43] this last part with me these three
[52:47] are one
[52:50] they're not
[52:51] they're not they're not separate
[52:54] it's the same
[52:56] god all along
[53:00] the father the word which is the son
[53:04] and the holy ghost these three are ones
[53:06] so you can't
[53:08] you can't have the father without having
[53:11] the word
[53:13] you can't have the word without having
[53:16] the holy ghost and you can't have the
[53:18] holy ghost without having the father and
[53:21] without having the word you can't have
[53:23] it
[53:28] and there are three verse eight
[53:31] there are three that bear witness in
[53:34] earth the spirit
[53:37] and the water and the blood
[53:40] and these three
[53:42] agree in one
[53:46] justification
[53:48] will you repent of your sins
[53:50] and you're baptized in the name of the
[53:52] lord jesus christ the name
[53:55] of our sacrifice
[53:57] he who shed his blood for me he who has
[54:00] dealt with my heart and has spoken to me
[54:03] that is justification that's the water
[54:07] the water the preaching of the word is
[54:10] what brings you to the realization of
[54:14] your sins and brings conviction it's the
[54:16] waters of separation
[54:19] and the blood is that which sanctifies
[54:23] us
[54:24] his life as the spirit of god moves into
[54:28] that life and the heart begins to just
[54:30] take the word and just yearning just to
[54:33] live by that word and the word begins to
[54:36] cleanse and purify and sentiments all
[54:39] the work of the holy spirit and then the
[54:42] spirit himself who's been working all
[54:45] along moves and comes to the inside of
[54:50] that life that vessel that he's prepared
[54:53] then these three agree in one because
[54:56] you can be justified
[54:58] without being sanctified
[55:01] you understand justified a person can
[55:04] receive the lord jesus christ as their
[55:06] savior and still
[55:09] be of the world because what what made
[55:12] them do it in the first place is still
[55:13] in there
[55:15] they're smoking their drinking their
[55:16] adultery and all those things are still
[55:18] in there but you see there's a start
[55:21] where the spirit of god begins to deal
[55:23] with that life
[55:24] sanctification is what
[55:26] cleans out the vessel
[55:30] is that right
[55:32] it's the holy spirit it's not our works
[55:34] listen to me now it's not our works it's
[55:37] a holy ghost doing the work it's us
[55:40] yielding to him
[55:43] is that right he's preparing the pathway
[55:46] for himself
[55:48] he doesn't need our help all he needs is
[55:50] our yielding
[55:53] notice if we receive so you could be
[55:56] justified and sanctified and not re and
[55:59] not have the holy ghost
[56:03] it takes it takes a complete work of
[56:06] redemption
[56:08] of justification sanctification
[56:11] and the baptism of the holy ghost
[56:14] you see this is why
[56:16] when you when you when you take things
[56:19] of the world
[56:20] and of the world and teachings and
[56:22] brother jerry i believe he referred to
[56:23] this on thursday nights out of the
[56:25] message you must be born again false
[56:27] teachers bring false births
[56:30] this is why when a person can say here
[56:32] they come in and say well i've accepted
[56:34] the lord jesus christ and the tenants of
[56:37] that church say oh you're born again no
[56:40] that is not born again you first must
[56:44] hear the truth this is scripture
[56:47] after you've heard the truth
[56:50] you are sealed with the holy spirit of
[56:53] promise
[56:54] is that right
[56:55] when paul came to them paul came to some
[56:58] good uh
[56:59] baptist or whatever you'd call it up on
[57:01] acts 19 and said have you received the
[57:04] holy ghost
[57:05] since
[57:06] he believed
[57:08] because this is why the confusion
[57:10] when you find where lives are looking at
[57:13] well i've believed and i must be born
[57:15] again no born again is where there is an
[57:18] absolute change on the inside
[57:22] to believe it starts with that but you
[57:26] must go all the way
[57:34] if we receive the witness of men the
[57:36] witness of god is greater for this is
[57:38] the witness of god which he hath
[57:40] testified of his son
[57:43] let me just let me just say just some
[57:46] inspiration here from a couple weeks ago
[57:48] and then throughout the course of this
[57:50] past week and on monday and i'm just
[57:52] setting and
[57:54] i'm just as i've been going through the
[57:56] adoption series and some things we're
[57:58] dealing with on the midweek service
[58:00] and
[58:01] i'm just just pondering many of these
[58:04] things of where that we're standing in
[58:06] this moment and brother branham begins
[58:08] to even in the adoption series of part
[58:11] three it'd be good here over the course
[58:13] of because i don't know if i'll get
[58:14] finished here this morning but to go
[58:16] back and listen to that message he
[58:18] preaches it twice but listen to the one
[58:21] right before he preaches the adoption
[58:23] then you can listen to the other one but
[58:25] brother branham is pulling this
[58:27] inspiration because when he preaches the
[58:29] rejected king he's just had a visitation
[58:34] beyond the curtain of time
[58:37] and what took place there in that moment
[58:39] brother graham said i cannot be the same
[58:42] william branham now brother branham
[58:43] didn't get born again again
[58:45] but there was an experience in the
[58:47] presence of god that it didn't it didn't
[58:50] diminish but it actually stirred up and
[58:53] just made it even more clear and it
[58:56] caused desperation and
[58:59] perseverance to rise within his heart
[59:02] you see that's what every true
[59:04] experience and that's why we need
[59:07] experiences in the presence of god
[59:11] we can't live off of yesterday's
[59:14] experience you say i've had an
[59:16] experience with god if you've had an
[59:18] experience with god where your life has
[59:20] been changed and you pass from death
[59:23] unto life then there is a hunger to have
[59:26] more
[59:27] experiences with god and you must have
[59:31] more experiences with god
[59:34] it's not enough just to have one you see
[59:36] that's not the heart of a believer
[59:40] it's a desire i want more experiences
[59:43] with god
[59:44] because in those experiences there is
[59:47] change that takes place
[59:49] brother and sister we have an access
[59:51] this morning
[59:53] an audience with a king there's no not a
[59:56] middle man
[59:57] we have one mediator between god and man
[1:00:00] and that's the man christ jesus god
[1:00:02] himself came down he is our high priest
[1:00:06] we're not we don't have a middle man in
[1:00:08] the building this morning our high
[1:00:10] priest the holy spirit is right here
[1:00:13] this morning
[1:00:16] and we can take our request to him
[1:00:19] give it to him and you know and brother
[1:00:22] branham when he speaks of this in in the
[1:00:24] rejected king i i want to go into this
[1:00:27] and i want this thought as we would look
[1:00:29] at that who is your king
[1:00:32] and david declaring here the lord is my
[1:00:35] shepherd
[1:00:36] brother branham picks this up here
[1:00:39] and he says i don't have this on the
[1:00:41] screen because i'm just going to pull
[1:00:42] from things
[1:00:43] it's it's here
[1:00:45] and and this is right out of the summer
[1:00:48] church age and brother braham says just
[1:00:50] as the early church
[1:00:52] started out under the pure ministry of
[1:00:54] the holy spirit with signs and wonders
[1:00:58] manifestations such as prophecy tongues
[1:01:01] interpretation wisdom knowledge healing
[1:01:04] so in the days of israel when they left
[1:01:05] egypt they were under the leadership of
[1:01:08] the spirit of god manifesting in gifts
[1:01:11] god was the leader of the people
[1:01:16] now listen to this
[1:01:17] actually he was their king
[1:01:21] he was a father king he took care of
[1:01:25] israel like a man cares for his family
[1:01:28] he fed them
[1:01:30] fought their battles smoothed away their
[1:01:32] difficulties and settled their problems
[1:01:35] he just busied himself over them they
[1:01:39] were the only nation to which he was
[1:01:42] truly god
[1:01:43] no wonder
[1:01:45] that that moses could could could
[1:01:47] emphasize this
[1:01:50] to that new generation that it rose up
[1:01:53] to go into the land to remind them
[1:01:56] that you have the lord god so nigh unto
[1:02:01] you that in all things that we call upon
[1:02:03] him for so all of this of how god was a
[1:02:06] father king he busied himself he was
[1:02:09] their king he he fought their battles
[1:02:11] that did not mean and i think we
[1:02:13] understand this it did not mean that
[1:02:15] they were sitting on the sidelines and
[1:02:17] doing their own thing it meant that they
[1:02:20] completely trusted god and they trusted
[1:02:23] his leadership they were engaging with
[1:02:26] god god was engaging with them and when
[1:02:29] needs arose they didn't they were
[1:02:32] looking to god notice god had come so on
[1:02:35] the scene
[1:02:36] he had made himself known i am your
[1:02:39] provider i know they didn't really get
[1:02:42] it when they first left egypt and and
[1:02:44] you know they left and they got out
[1:02:46] there and you know there was a mixed
[1:02:47] multitude that's sure but sometimes
[1:02:49] those things can kind of pervade and and
[1:02:52] how it is around but notice when it came
[1:02:54] to the red sea and they saw there uh of
[1:02:57] of the taskmasters in egypt that was
[1:03:00] coming after him to try to bring him
[1:03:02] back in bondage notice here god is is
[1:03:06] showing and making himself known that
[1:03:09] god is a waymaker and god is going to
[1:03:12] stand right there and open away that
[1:03:15] wasn't just for that moment that was to
[1:03:17] build their faith that no matter what
[1:03:20] comes around my way he's the same god
[1:03:23] and it ties back to the blood of the
[1:03:26] lamb being provided it ties back to the
[1:03:29] unleavened bread it ties back to the
[1:03:31] lamb that i am sustained by that they
[1:03:34] can look back and say god provided a
[1:03:36] sacrifice for me
[1:03:38] god provided a way through the red sea
[1:03:40] for me and they could look to god no
[1:03:43] matter what the need was god was
[1:03:46] declaring i am your everything
[1:03:51] all that you have need of i am your
[1:03:54] everything i want to do for you
[1:03:59] but one day
[1:04:02] they got to looking around
[1:04:04] now god knows what's in the heart of man
[1:04:07] because in the book of deuteronomy
[1:04:09] chapter 17 he said when you get over in
[1:04:11] the land
[1:04:13] and you start looking around
[1:04:15] and you're going to battle
[1:04:17] then you will say in your heart
[1:04:19] we need a king like the other nations
[1:04:24] which we need to be like them
[1:04:27] see same way it wasn't eden it was an
[1:04:30] inlet of the eye
[1:04:31] satan began to get eve to focus there
[1:04:34] and through that focus it was more than
[1:04:37] just a sight but that i itself is that
[1:04:40] of the mental the reasonings and taking
[1:04:43] and taking it in there to the mind let
[1:04:45] me say this to you the mind itself does
[1:04:48] not have life in it but the mind itself
[1:04:51] is a womb to the spirit you can either
[1:04:54] take in or take out you know why the
[1:04:56] devil battles so hard and why that the
[1:04:58] greatest battle ever fought is in the
[1:05:00] mind because it's in the mind where
[1:05:02] decisions are made
[1:05:05] and every one of us got decisions to
[1:05:07] make before us it doesn't matter where
[1:05:09] you're at in your christian walk with
[1:05:10] god you all we all have decisions to
[1:05:15] make
[1:05:16] and god ain't going to make them for us
[1:05:18] right he didn't make the decision for
[1:05:20] mary mary made a decision what she did
[1:05:24] under that anointing that anointing
[1:05:27] removed fear removed doubt and brought
[1:05:29] her into cooperation with the vision
[1:05:32] that was before the foundation of the
[1:05:34] world
[1:05:36] that's what the holy spirit is set for
[1:05:38] to bring us in cooperation that we might
[1:05:41] come into position that god can fulfill
[1:05:43] his word through our lives
[1:05:47] but one day they got to looking around
[1:05:50] and they saw the philistines and other
[1:05:52] nations and kings over them i want you
[1:05:54] to catch this
[1:05:55] it caught their eyes
[1:05:57] and they decided
[1:05:59] that they ought to humanize
[1:06:01] their
[1:06:02] leadership so they wanted a king
[1:06:05] now god was going to listen this now now
[1:06:09] god was going to humanize the leadership
[1:06:12] himself in the person of the lord jesus
[1:06:14] christ but they
[1:06:16] got ahead of him
[1:06:20] the whole fall itself took place in the
[1:06:23] beginning because
[1:06:24] at that moment where satan began to
[1:06:27] interpret multiply and replenish the
[1:06:30] earth and then what's he doing moving
[1:06:32] the people ahead of god's program
[1:06:37] god's program ain't defeated
[1:06:41] god's program did not suffer a blow
[1:06:44] dumb devil what he failed to recognize
[1:06:47] is is through that would release the
[1:06:50] redemptive attributes of jehovah god
[1:06:56] hallelujah he was all before there was
[1:06:58] ever a sickness he was already the
[1:07:00] healer
[1:07:01] before you and i were in need of
[1:07:03] deliverance he was already the deliverer
[1:07:08] glory be to god
[1:07:10] notice this they thought so they they
[1:07:12] wanted to humanize their leadership so
[1:07:14] they wanted a king now god was going to
[1:07:16] humanize the leadership himself in the
[1:07:18] person of the lord jesus christ but they
[1:07:20] got ahead of him and satan knew the plan
[1:07:23] of god so he put it in the hearts of the
[1:07:25] people to get ahead of god the word
[1:07:30] let me just say this and this applies
[1:07:32] you can put it in your lunchbox and take
[1:07:34] it with you home
[1:07:35] never will the spirit of god
[1:07:38] bring about anxiousness in your life
[1:07:41] i gotta make this decision that dude
[1:07:43] writing that right then the first thing
[1:07:45] to do i'm just giving you stuff to put
[1:07:46] in the lunch box step away oh brother
[1:07:49] samuel i'm really trying to decide what
[1:07:51] color of paint you say god's considered
[1:07:53] about and concerned about those things
[1:07:55] god's considered and concerned god rich
[1:07:58] in mercy god he said is interested in
[1:08:01] everything you anticipate in
[1:08:05] that's how much god is interested in we
[1:08:07] we're believers are we not we're not
[1:08:10] people that all of a sudden come to
[1:08:11] church and take god out of a locker and
[1:08:14] put him on and hang him back up but this
[1:08:17] is alive this is a reality this is a
[1:08:20] real substance in our life we're not a
[1:08:22] christian on thursday and somebody else
[1:08:25] any day of the week we are christians
[1:08:28] every day of the week
[1:08:32] not because we've made ourselves that
[1:08:34] but because our king has declared his
[1:08:38] kingship in the throne of our heart
[1:08:45] and they approached samuel
[1:08:47] i'm just going to read this and
[1:08:50] they asked for a king samuel was so
[1:08:52] dismayed you know this as a bible reader
[1:08:54] he was dismayed in his heart
[1:08:58] now
[1:09:00] samuel you know he took it a little
[1:09:02] personal
[1:09:03] but the reality because he was god's
[1:09:05] spokesman
[1:09:06] samuel's heart was for the people
[1:09:10] remember
[1:09:11] he learned
[1:09:12] he learned what it was
[1:09:15] to heed to the voice of god when god
[1:09:17] would call his name he learned what he
[1:09:19] was just just come in the presence of
[1:09:22] god and silence himself and say here i
[1:09:25] am
[1:09:27] he learned that
[1:09:29] samuel knew what he was that it ain't my
[1:09:31] thoughts these people need
[1:09:33] they don't need my thoughts
[1:09:40] oh god let it ring through every
[1:09:42] building let me tell you something
[1:09:43] friends thank god for our families but
[1:09:46] in our families in our homes in our
[1:09:48] lives what we need is the voice of god
[1:09:52] not well this is how brownings do it
[1:09:54] this is how hernandez is doing this is
[1:09:56] how sanchez is do it this is how the
[1:09:58] hannahs have always done it this is how
[1:10:00] no what we need is the voice of almighty
[1:10:03] god because we are of a different family
[1:10:07] tree
[1:10:08] [Applause]
[1:10:12] because there's some rascals in the
[1:10:13] brownings and if not for the grace of
[1:10:16] god
[1:10:19] right here too
[1:10:21] right here too and you can go ahead and
[1:10:23] look in the mirror and i say a man for
[1:10:25] him every one of us
[1:10:27] it isn't that oh boy i'll tell you what
[1:10:30] there's some real good people it's the
[1:10:32] holy ghost
[1:10:34] there is none
[1:10:36] good but god
[1:10:41] [Applause]
[1:10:47] but samuel that's pretty simple i know
[1:10:48] but i just got to say it as he gives it
[1:10:51] god had been leading his people
[1:10:54] listen this through this consecrated
[1:10:56] scripture vindicated prophet
[1:10:59] and he felt that he had been rejected
[1:11:02] he gathered the people pleaded with them
[1:11:04] not to turn away from god
[1:11:07] who had carried them away who had
[1:11:08] carried them like children think of it
[1:11:10] god god carried them like children
[1:11:14] that's the scripture
[1:11:16] as a father doth this child
[1:11:18] god carried them at times when they
[1:11:20] couldn't walk
[1:11:23] we'll pick that up in some of the family
[1:11:24] services here but god carried them
[1:11:27] as a father to care for his children
[1:11:30] when the times hey listen he does the
[1:11:32] same thing for you and i
[1:11:34] there's times where we can't walk
[1:11:36] and he comes along and he carries us
[1:11:39] we have never got too big to come into
[1:11:41] the arms of jehovah we still need the
[1:11:46] leading and the care of almighty god
[1:11:49] hallelujah we're not of this spirit here
[1:11:52] that says i have need of nothing but
[1:11:54] we're able to stand there and say lord i
[1:11:56] need you to pick me up right now lord
[1:12:00] [Applause]
[1:12:01] you're my king i need you to pick me up
[1:12:04] right now
[1:12:06] oh god i'm glad i'm with number with
[1:12:09] people who believe that god is that
[1:12:11] personal and who know him to be that
[1:12:13] personal
[1:12:14] he's not setting way off his hand has
[1:12:17] been stretched down to us in this
[1:12:19] generation this word has become flesh in
[1:12:23] this generation the arm of the lord hath
[1:12:26] been revealed
[1:12:29] the power the strength the glory
[1:12:32] of god has been revealed and his eye is
[1:12:35] present to guide us
[1:12:39] god personified in his people
[1:12:47] he gathered the people he pleaded with
[1:12:48] them not to turn away from god
[1:12:52] he couldn't see samuel couldn't make the
[1:12:53] decision for him
[1:12:55] he couldn't say
[1:12:57] you're not going to do this
[1:12:59] he knew
[1:13:01] samuel knew
[1:13:03] their decision
[1:13:05] he knew that it was wrong
[1:13:08] because it was
[1:13:10] with the wrong
[1:13:11] motives
[1:13:13] the wrong objectives
[1:13:15] it was looking at something else
[1:13:19] and let me say this to you
[1:13:21] if you've got your eyes on anybody
[1:13:23] you better make sure it's christ that
[1:13:25] you're following
[1:13:26] [Music]
[1:13:27] you better make sure they're following
[1:13:28] christ well my mama you better make sure
[1:13:30] mama's following christ
[1:13:32] well my dad you better make sure daddy's
[1:13:34] following christ
[1:13:35] well my pastor you better make sure your
[1:13:37] pastor is following christ
[1:13:40] paul said follow me as i follow christ
[1:13:45] in other words with that same
[1:13:47] surrenderedness and sensitivity and
[1:13:50] desire for his leading you're to follow
[1:13:53] in the same way
[1:13:57] we're just saying what are you saying
[1:13:58] i'm saying it's time by god's grace for
[1:14:00] certain cycles to be broken
[1:14:03] and i'll tell you who's the cycle
[1:14:05] breaker is the holy ghost
[1:14:07] he breaks all kinds of strings and
[1:14:09] everything else that can be right down
[1:14:11] in a family and this this family's been
[1:14:13] like this but the holy ghost comes down
[1:14:15] on the sea brother what does he do he
[1:14:18] takes us and we are grafted into the
[1:14:20] tree of life and we begin not to produce
[1:14:23] our natural fruit but we have overcoming
[1:14:26] strength and grace and it's the fruit of
[1:14:28] jesus christ that begins to move
[1:14:31] throughout our life
[1:14:33] all grace
[1:14:39] he prospered them
[1:14:41] blessed blessed them
[1:14:43] but they persisted
[1:14:45] they said to samuel i want you to notice
[1:14:47] how brother brown just paraphrases this
[1:14:49] right from the scripture
[1:14:51] you've never been wrong in your lead
[1:14:53] you have never been dishonest in your
[1:14:55] financial dealings you have done your
[1:14:57] best to keep us in line with the word of
[1:14:59] the lord
[1:15:00] we appreciate the miracles
[1:15:03] wisdom provision and protection of god
[1:15:05] we believe in it
[1:15:07] we like it and furthermore we don't want
[1:15:10] to be without it
[1:15:12] it's just
[1:15:14] that we want a king
[1:15:17] to lead us into battle how's that old
[1:15:18] saying go
[1:15:19] you want your cake and
[1:15:21] eat it too
[1:15:26] we like we we we don't want the miracles
[1:15:28] to stop we don't want the signs and
[1:15:30] wonders we don't want the blessings we
[1:15:32] don't want all those provisions
[1:15:34] but it's just
[1:15:37] we want a king
[1:15:39] to lead us to battle
[1:15:41] well pray tell how do you think you won
[1:15:43] them battles
[1:15:45] because you weren't skilled as soldiers
[1:15:49] we're not talking ratios that make sense
[1:15:52] one sends a thousandth of light
[1:15:54] two ten thousand that doesn't make sense
[1:15:58] humanly that don't make sense we're
[1:16:00] talking about a group of people they did
[1:16:02] not have that of
[1:16:04] weaponry but they had a greater weapon
[1:16:10] hallelujah they had the word of the lord
[1:16:13] that had been delivered to him they had
[1:16:15] a greater weapon
[1:16:19] now of course when we go out to battle
[1:16:22] this is them talking when we go out to
[1:16:24] battle it's still our intention to have
[1:16:26] the priests go ahead with judah
[1:16:28] following and we will blow the trumpets
[1:16:30] and shouting so in other words it all
[1:16:32] looks the same
[1:16:34] we don't intend to stop any of that
[1:16:37] but we want a king who is one of us to
[1:16:40] lead us
[1:16:41] that's the problem
[1:16:45] we needed a king to lead us who's one of
[1:16:48] us but
[1:16:49] not one of us
[1:16:50] not one who has the same nature as us
[1:16:55] but we need one
[1:16:56] who's greater
[1:16:59] we need one who's a real king that's
[1:17:01] what we really need
[1:17:02] are you with me those are my words
[1:17:05] and god said to samuel see they have not
[1:17:07] rejected you but they've rejected me
[1:17:11] from ruling over them
[1:17:14] so you see they had all this other thing
[1:17:16] that you know the songs were going for
[1:17:18] can i just bring it on down they were
[1:17:20] still opening up the hymnals to amazing
[1:17:22] grace they were still opening you know
[1:17:25] the hymnals i shall not be moved and all
[1:17:28] of the hymns and our mighty fortresses
[1:17:31] are god and all the songs they were
[1:17:33] still singing and conducting their
[1:17:35] prayer services and they still had signs
[1:17:38] and miracles and things among them but
[1:17:40] what they failed to realize is when you
[1:17:43] reject him you've rejected everything
[1:17:48] and songs and signs and miracles without
[1:17:52] him
[1:17:54] mean nothing
[1:17:57] he
[1:17:58] is what means everything.
[1:18:05] that's why when brother branham could
[1:18:06] stand in the church ages and say when
[1:18:08] people you know they're pulling this way
[1:18:10] about gifts and pulling this way and
[1:18:12] it's so clearly laid out in the message
[1:18:14] of the hour
[1:18:16] and he makes a statement he says i
[1:18:18] wonder are we sufficiently impressed
[1:18:22] with the word
[1:18:23] in our midst
[1:18:28] the chasing after all these other things
[1:18:31] when if you have him all these other
[1:18:33] things are there
[1:18:36] and your life is not lived based on
[1:18:39] those things
[1:18:40] but your life is lived from him for he
[1:18:43] is the bread of life
[1:18:46] he is our life
[1:18:50] oh my little did they realize when they
[1:18:52] were asking god to let him be like the
[1:18:54] rest of the world they were rejecting
[1:18:56] him because god had ordained that his
[1:18:59] people act different from the world how
[1:19:01] many know that's true
[1:19:03] god has ordained that his people act
[1:19:06] different from the world
[1:19:09] it's like the saying goes if it if it
[1:19:11] barks like a dog walks like a dog
[1:19:14] it's a dog
[1:19:18] that ain't really anything real hard if
[1:19:20] it meows and it you know presses around
[1:19:22] and curls its tail and one or more it's
[1:19:24] a cat
[1:19:25] how do you know it by its
[1:19:27] characteristics
[1:19:29] and the characteristics are only a
[1:19:32] testimony of the character of life
[1:19:35] that's on the inside
[1:19:38] well let's bring it on down if it looks
[1:19:41] like a son of god acts like a son of god
[1:19:44] talks like a son of god lives like a son
[1:19:46] of god then it's a son of god
[1:19:53] a life that's lived
[1:19:55] by the word not god had ordained that
[1:19:57] his people act different from the world
[1:19:59] they are not of the world and they don't
[1:20:01] look like the world they don't act like
[1:20:03] the world they are crucified under the
[1:20:05] world and the world is crucified unto
[1:20:07] them
[1:20:11] second corinthians 6 17 verse 17 to 18
[1:20:15] wherefore come out from among them and
[1:20:16] be you separate saith the lord and touch
[1:20:19] not the unclean thing
[1:20:21] and i will receive you and will be a
[1:20:24] father unto you and you shall be my sons
[1:20:27] and daughters saith the lord
[1:20:30] almighty so there's a difference
[1:20:36] let's say that together there's a
[1:20:38] difference
[1:20:39] let's say it again there's a difference
[1:20:45] god made a distinction between light and
[1:20:47] darkness in the beginning
[1:20:51] god made a distinction in egypt the
[1:20:54] bible says when it came time for the
[1:20:57] death they know angel to pass by
[1:20:59] and the blood of the lamb was to be
[1:21:01] taken and applied upon the lentils and
[1:21:04] the doorposts that the bible says that
[1:21:07] they will know how the lord doth make a
[1:21:10] difference
[1:21:12] it's not you making a difference it's
[1:21:14] not you making yourself different please
[1:21:17] understand me that'll only last for so
[1:21:19] long because it's your strength
[1:21:24] well i i want god to be the king of my
[1:21:26] life but he can't be king while you're
[1:21:29] still in power
[1:21:34] you understand
[1:21:35] you can't pick and choose from the word
[1:21:37] and declare him to be your king because
[1:21:39] it is not you can't add or take away
[1:21:41] from it and the word be the king in your
[1:21:44] life
[1:21:46] hello somebody
[1:21:49] you see
[1:21:50] this is why
[1:21:52] when it comes up to it then the bible
[1:21:54] says you see the one difference between
[1:21:56] israel and the rest of the nations was
[1:21:59] god
[1:22:00] you put god to one side and israel was
[1:22:03] like any other nation
[1:22:05] when samson cut off his hair he was like
[1:22:08] any other man
[1:22:10] right
[1:22:13] he whipped thousands of philistines
[1:22:16] went in his hair being a nazarite vow
[1:22:20] under the spirit of god coming upon him
[1:22:24] it was not samson's strength
[1:22:28] samson didn't look like arnold
[1:22:30] schwarzenegger
[1:22:34] samson was not on bodybuilding usa
[1:22:38] he was a curly-headed little shrimp
[1:22:42] you say brother samuel how can you say
[1:22:43] it well first of all because the prophet
[1:22:45] said it
[1:22:46] second of all the pattern in the
[1:22:48] scripture says god will never share his
[1:22:51] glory with nobody
[1:22:55] god didn't need the human strength of a
[1:22:58] man it was a man that was small but he
[1:23:00] was yielded and when the spirit of god
[1:23:03] said go pick up that jawbone he just
[1:23:06] obeyed and in obedience he leveled them
[1:23:09] philistines
[1:23:10] [Applause]
[1:23:11] you don't have to be a great big
[1:23:13] somebody or you got to be as a yielded
[1:23:16] vessel in obedience to god and there's
[1:23:19] not a devil can stand before you
[1:23:26] hallelujah
[1:23:28] notice this
[1:23:29] he said when samson cut off his hair he
[1:23:32] was like any other man
[1:23:34] you put the leadership of the holy ghost
[1:23:36] aside
[1:23:38] and the church is nothing but the world
[1:23:41] with god's name attached to it
[1:23:44] the world and the church are all of the
[1:23:46] same lump just like jacob and esau were
[1:23:49] of the same parents but the spirit of
[1:23:51] god
[1:23:53] makes the difference
[1:23:55] it doesn't matter if you call yourself a
[1:23:58] christian
[1:23:59] anyone
[1:24:00] can do that
[1:24:08] glory yeah when i you when i'm laughing
[1:24:11] i'm just enjoying the word is that all
[1:24:13] right
[1:24:14] like brother dan daisley said he said
[1:24:15] when i laughed he said what it is
[1:24:16] there's a big old feather on the inside
[1:24:18] it just it goes back and forth and just
[1:24:19] kind of tickled me i just appreciate how
[1:24:22] the word comes out and talks to you
[1:24:24] hallelujah i'm just you know when i come
[1:24:26] in and preach i'm just like i am at home
[1:24:28] or like i am in my office i ain't no
[1:24:30] different except i may be well i can't
[1:24:32] say i don't scream as loud but you know
[1:24:34] it's just a wonderful thing when the
[1:24:36] word it speaks to us
[1:24:38] it doesn't matter if you call yourself a
[1:24:40] christian anyone can do that the point
[1:24:42] is whether or not you have the spirit of
[1:24:45] god in you for without the spirit you're
[1:24:47] a reprobate you're none of his
[1:24:51] now may i may i just drop this here in
[1:24:53] john 14. let me just try to to lay this
[1:24:57] in here in john 14.
[1:25:01] you see in the message before i read
[1:25:03] this
[1:25:04] in the message
[1:25:06] first in 1965
[1:25:09] brother brabham says you can tell
[1:25:13] you can tell who's on the throne of your
[1:25:14] heart
[1:25:16] by the desire
[1:25:17] you have within you
[1:25:22] because
[1:25:24] that of christ on the inside of that
[1:25:26] life it'll produce a desire for more of
[1:25:29] god
[1:25:32] i know that's simple but i like that's
[1:25:34] what the message is the message made it
[1:25:36] very simple it's in the scriptures right
[1:25:38] here can we read in john 14 chapter
[1:25:41] john 14 and verse 18. now there's three
[1:25:43] portions of scripture but i'm just going
[1:25:44] to read this one i'm going to read here
[1:25:46] a few verses and i i just want to just
[1:25:49] read these
[1:25:50] and coming to a point
[1:25:52] i will not this is the lord jesus before
[1:25:55] his departure i will not leave you
[1:25:59] comfortless
[1:26:02] i will come to you
[1:26:05] now here
[1:26:06] they're hearing a human voice
[1:26:09] but it's not a human voice it's god
[1:26:13] speaking through that veil that i am
[1:26:17] going to come to you
[1:26:24] yet a little while and the world seeth
[1:26:26] me no more
[1:26:28] but you see me
[1:26:30] because i live you shall live also
[1:26:34] i'm gonna pay the price and they didn't
[1:26:37] understand this at that time
[1:26:40] is that right and you and i didn't
[1:26:41] understand it until god began to deal
[1:26:43] with our heart and then the holy ghost
[1:26:45] comes and guess what he makes it more
[1:26:47] and more and more real to your heart
[1:26:51] is that right
[1:26:53] but because i live and that i have rose
[1:26:57] up on that easter morning that i triumph
[1:26:59] over death hell in the grave
[1:27:02] because i live you shall live also
[1:27:05] you see the word was prophesying of its
[1:27:08] coming in the flesh and lives of the
[1:27:12] believers you shall live also well i
[1:27:15] thought i am alive but we're not alive
[1:27:17] in christ we are walking around as dead
[1:27:21] men
[1:27:23] alive to the world
[1:27:27] but we're dead
[1:27:30] that soul that liveth in pleasure
[1:27:34] it dies is that right
[1:27:36] the pleasures of sin is but for a
[1:27:39] season
[1:27:41] right
[1:27:43] hallelujah we all can listen for him i
[1:27:45] don't care i don't care who your daddy
[1:27:46] and mommy is
[1:27:47] we all come into this world by that
[1:27:49] first birth
[1:27:51] we got another king on the heart
[1:27:55] we have a king that's there because of
[1:27:57] the deception that took place in the
[1:28:00] garden of eden let me ask you a question
[1:28:03] why did it have to be a virgin birth
[1:28:08] that ain't just something thrown out
[1:28:10] there
[1:28:12] why did it have to be a virgin birth
[1:28:14] free
[1:28:15] from
[1:28:16] human instrumentality
[1:28:19] tell me why it had to be that way
[1:28:22] because it had to be a blood that was
[1:28:26] not tied to that of the fallen race
[1:28:30] but god created a blood cell god came
[1:28:34] down and he didn't borrow an egg from
[1:28:36] mary but god supplied sperm and a a body
[1:28:42] has thou prepared for me
[1:28:45] you know why he was doing that he was
[1:28:47] doing it for our redemption
[1:28:50] that he could pay the price that you
[1:28:52] could set in a meeting like this under
[1:28:55] the anointing of the holy ghost and say
[1:28:58] boo devil you've kept this from me long
[1:29:01] enough and i am not going to stand for
[1:29:03] it no longer
[1:29:06] i realize that my redemption is more
[1:29:09] than going to a church my redemption is
[1:29:13] a union with jesus christ
[1:29:16] where the king of glory
[1:29:18] writes in in power
[1:29:24] hallelujah
[1:29:26] verse 20.
[1:29:29] can you just bear with me on these
[1:29:30] verses
[1:29:32] at that day
[1:29:35] say out that day with
[1:29:36] me that's this day
[1:29:41] ye shall know
[1:29:43] the understanding notice jesus was
[1:29:45] prophesying he knew there was going to
[1:29:47] come a falling away he knew that that of
[1:29:50] that white horse rider would enter in he
[1:29:53] knew they would surrender the creeds not
[1:29:55] the real elect
[1:29:57] are you hearing me now not the real
[1:29:59] elect
[1:30:00] every one of those seven ages they've
[1:30:04] received their baptism of the holy
[1:30:07] spirit
[1:30:08] because seven days you must eat
[1:30:11] unleavened bread
[1:30:14] are you hearing me
[1:30:15] so god god gave his word in that age now
[1:30:19] just stay with me a minute god gave his
[1:30:21] word in that age but yet we realized
[1:30:24] after the after things had begun to fall
[1:30:27] right there as they entered that
[1:30:28] ephesian age there were other things
[1:30:30] that began to enter and there was truth
[1:30:33] that was lost but when god begin to
[1:30:35] restore
[1:30:36] that first part of unleavened bread is
[1:30:39] that of where that the just shall live
[1:30:41] by faith
[1:30:43] but when men added their own ideas to
[1:30:46] luther's message then it became leavened
[1:30:51] long as they stayed with the word that
[1:30:53] god gave that was unleavened bread
[1:30:57] amen
[1:30:59] is that all right
[1:31:01] it's the same now in this time we are
[1:31:04] not living by partial
[1:31:06] light
[1:31:09] well i thought there should have been a
[1:31:10] bigger amen than that
[1:31:12] if there's anything we should have been
[1:31:13] shouting and dancing on it should be
[1:31:14] that that reality
[1:31:17] because we have received in this hour
[1:31:20] not the mind of a man
[1:31:23] we have received a perfect
[1:31:25] interpretation of the word of god
[1:31:28] delivered by the holy ghost himself
[1:31:31] [Applause]
[1:31:35] you see this is that time of adoption
[1:31:39] this is that urgency
[1:31:41] that the prophet ties in with the
[1:31:42] rejected king and he said god in this
[1:31:45] hour is going to raise up men that are
[1:31:49] anointed with the same spirit of god
[1:31:51] that had come back to the word that the
[1:31:54] church might be positioned in its
[1:31:56] adoption
[1:31:58] your rightful position
[1:32:02] my
[1:32:04] my my
[1:32:05] i feel like shouting a little bit
[1:32:09] glory be to god
[1:32:10] you shall know that i am in my father
[1:32:13] and ye and me and i in you
[1:32:15] he
[1:32:16] that hath my commandments
[1:32:18] and keepeth them he it is that loveth me
[1:32:22] so god's speaking to your heart
[1:32:26] to take that word
[1:32:28] and begin to nourish begin to feed upon
[1:32:30] that word
[1:32:31] begin to pray over the word you're
[1:32:33] receiving
[1:32:34] in the services no matter where you're
[1:32:36] at
[1:32:37] but even in those that are even in your
[1:32:40] beginnings of your journey is taking
[1:32:42] that word in you see friends listen if
[1:32:44] the word stops here
[1:32:48] it does you no good
[1:32:52] oh brother samuel i want to leave i want
[1:32:54] to live deeper
[1:32:56] you take the word that god is
[1:32:57] ministering to us
[1:33:00] there's things that we can read in the
[1:33:01] word of god and we know
[1:33:03] thou shalt not do this and thou shalt
[1:33:04] not do that but god promised that he
[1:33:07] would provide shepherds
[1:33:09] and apostles and prophets and teachers
[1:33:10] and that is for as the prophet said the
[1:33:13] scriptural teaching and setting it
[1:33:14] together of the word of god
[1:33:17] we need the discernment of the holy
[1:33:19] spirit
[1:33:20] is that right so within within that that
[1:33:24] being said then we take that word into
[1:33:26] our life and and if it's only just
[1:33:28] coming to church we are missing the part
[1:33:31] and we're not doing what we should be
[1:33:32] doing and that's why the word's not
[1:33:34] having the effect that it should be
[1:33:36] having
[1:33:44] let me read on
[1:33:46] and he that loveth me
[1:33:48] shall be loved of my father
[1:33:50] o glory
[1:33:52] and i will love him and will manifest
[1:33:54] myself to him judas saith unto him not
[1:33:56] iscariot lord how is it that thou will
[1:33:59] manifest thyself unto us and not unto
[1:34:01] the world how are you going to do this
[1:34:04] jesus answered and said if a man loved
[1:34:06] me
[1:34:09] who's a me
[1:34:11] it's a person
[1:34:14] right
[1:34:14] a person
[1:34:17] if a man loved me
[1:34:20] the person of jesus christ who is that
[1:34:23] the holy ghost who is that the word in
[1:34:26] the beginning was the word and the word
[1:34:27] was with god
[1:34:29] if a man loved me
[1:34:34] he will keep
[1:34:35] my words
[1:34:39] so here god beginning god dealing with a
[1:34:42] life god dealing with our hearts if a
[1:34:43] man love me he will keep my words
[1:34:47] and my father will love him
[1:34:51] and we will come unto him and make our
[1:34:54] abode with him oh i love that wish i
[1:34:57] could preach on that ween hour we will
[1:35:00] make we will come unto him and make our
[1:35:03] abode with him brother samuel that's two
[1:35:05] separate people it is not the father the
[1:35:08] word and the holy ghost these three are
[1:35:12] one
[1:35:14] it is the spirit and truth they that
[1:35:17] worship god
[1:35:19] must worship him in spirit
[1:35:22] and in truth
[1:35:26] just to have the word without the spirit
[1:35:29] is not perfect worship
[1:35:31] just to have the spirit without the word
[1:35:34] is not perfect worship but must worship
[1:35:37] him in spirit and in truth that's
[1:35:40] the king
[1:35:44] he that loveth me not
[1:35:47] keepeth not my saying in other words
[1:35:48] just kind of just disregard them
[1:35:52] and the word which you hear is not mine
[1:35:54] but the father fathers which sent me
[1:35:57] see he is the word
[1:35:59] he is the word made flesh
[1:36:02] the promise made alive and vindicated
[1:36:07] these things i've spoken to you unto you
[1:36:10] being yet present but the comforter
[1:36:14] which is the holy ghost
[1:36:16] whom the father will send
[1:36:19] in my name
[1:36:22] now i'm not just talking about somebody
[1:36:24] just saying the name of jesus christ the
[1:36:27] name is the characteristic of a person
[1:36:31] i know it's very simple when i was
[1:36:33] teaching school
[1:36:34] and they could say you got i won't call
[1:36:37] them names but you got so and so i want
[1:36:39] to know
[1:36:40] is that
[1:36:42] so and so i want to know the surname
[1:36:45] because i know a lot of these
[1:36:47] what's the surname and sometimes you
[1:36:49] hear the surname oh lord jesus help me
[1:36:53] sometimes you hear the surname and it's
[1:36:55] like
[1:36:56] glory to god they might have been worse
[1:36:59] you don't even know though you know what
[1:37:00] i mean because sometimes you want to
[1:37:01] know who is this you're talking about
[1:37:04] and that when we talk about the holy
[1:37:07] ghost the comforter he sends in his name
[1:37:10] what is his name the bible says
[1:37:12] revelations chapter 19 on his vesture
[1:37:15] was wrote on king of kings lord of lords
[1:37:19] and his name
[1:37:20] is called not his but it's called the
[1:37:23] word of god so when the word of god is
[1:37:26] being preached that's the name of god
[1:37:32] he's writing in in power
[1:37:39] [Applause]
[1:37:40] oh i want to preach on the dollar zion
[1:37:42] here a moment
[1:37:43] [Music]
[1:37:45] glory be to god in the highest
[1:37:48] but the comforter which is the holy
[1:37:49] ghost whom the father will send in my
[1:37:51] name he shall teach you all things and
[1:37:54] bring all things to your remembrance
[1:37:57] whatsoever i have said unto you
[1:38:01] he letting him know the things that you
[1:38:02] don't understand you'll understand when
[1:38:05] he has come
[1:38:07] and i am your parent i am your father i
[1:38:11] am your king i'm gonna lead you into all
[1:38:13] truth
[1:38:15] you don't have to be frustrated you
[1:38:17] don't have to try to find your own way
[1:38:19] i'm your king i'll lead you i'm here to
[1:38:21] take care of you i'm here to lead you
[1:38:24] all the way i am your comfort i am your
[1:38:27] shepherd
[1:38:29] hallelujah
[1:38:31] [Applause]
[1:38:33] who is our king the lord jesus christ
[1:38:38] the holy spirit has come down to take
[1:38:42] his rightful position
[1:38:44] in our hearts
[1:38:47] let's pray
[1:38:50] heavenly father
[1:38:54] lord
[1:38:56] this
[1:38:57] is our desire
[1:38:59] everyone lord as we are gathered here
[1:39:03] may this be a question
[1:39:05] that is very
[1:39:07] very clear
[1:39:08] clearly answered
[1:39:10] in the heart of every person
[1:39:13] who is your king
[1:39:15] who is your king
[1:39:17] lord
[1:39:20] we declare from our hearts
[1:39:22] i can declare from my heart
[1:39:25] as a redeemed subject
[1:39:27] there's a life that's been changed
[1:39:29] as a life others can join me lord with
[1:39:32] this and it's a testimony to others
[1:39:34] sitting here that your grace is
[1:39:36] sufficient lord
[1:39:38] that at one time we were under the
[1:39:40] domain of another
[1:39:42] kingdom
[1:39:44] lord moved about by the prince and power
[1:39:47] of the air
[1:39:48] but o heavenly father
[1:39:51] we didn't seek you out
[1:39:53] you came and sought us out lord
[1:39:56] just as a shepherd will
[1:39:58] go you laid it out in your word a
[1:40:00] shepherd would leave the 90-9 and go
[1:40:03] hunt down that one
[1:40:05] lord you have been and you are still so
[1:40:09] personal
[1:40:10] in each of our lives
[1:40:13] then lord when we had went astray
[1:40:15] you came and you found us
[1:40:18] even lord even now
[1:40:20] when lord of heart our life
[1:40:23] though
[1:40:24] they may go astray in their spirit
[1:40:27] or in their mind
[1:40:29] but you restore us
[1:40:31] our soul
[1:40:33] oh god
[1:40:35] how how how precious
[1:40:38] this is more than just a scripture
[1:40:42] this is my life
[1:40:44] this is our life the lord is my
[1:40:48] shepherd
[1:40:50] i shall not want
[1:40:52] i may have many needs but i shall not
[1:40:55] want
[1:40:56] because he's the one who's leading
[1:40:59] he's my shepherd he knows just
[1:41:02] what i have need of
[1:41:04] lord how you've rode into our lives
[1:41:07] with such grace and sweetness
[1:41:10] and authority
[1:41:12] and dismantling lord the hold of
[1:41:15] that former kingdom that king that was
[1:41:18] there that influence upon our life that
[1:41:22] lord
[1:41:23] caused us to
[1:41:24] act like the world oh
[1:41:26] there may be lives lord that never drank
[1:41:29] at all never smoked or maybe they never
[1:41:32] ran around at all maybe there's a maybe
[1:41:34] lord sitting here that it could be such
[1:41:36] a pristine life but it's it's more than
[1:41:38] that lord
[1:41:39] it's more than good morality it's more
[1:41:42] than well i made always this best choice
[1:41:44] in lord thankful that there's not scars
[1:41:47] that's there but
[1:41:49] that in itself
[1:41:51] that life
[1:41:53] is still in need
[1:41:55] of a change
[1:41:57] of kingship
[1:42:00] lord to where when
[1:42:02] the king of kings
[1:42:03] has come to the inside is moved in that
[1:42:06] life
[1:42:08] that life is no longer lived
[1:42:11] for itself
[1:42:13] no longer lived
[1:42:15] for its own desires but
[1:42:18] it's you lord
[1:42:20] it's you that we live for
[1:42:22] it's you that we love lord
[1:42:25] it's you lord it's your
[1:42:26] your word lord it's it's all of you we
[1:42:30] we love you
[1:42:32] lord i pray if there's one here this
[1:42:34] morning
[1:42:35] that it's not been that way in their
[1:42:37] life and they
[1:42:38] there's another
[1:42:40] there's another answer that they have
[1:42:42] when it's declared who is your king
[1:42:44] may they begin right here in this moment
[1:42:47] lord to entertain you
[1:42:49] if you love me

[1:44:37] that's me
[1:44:39] who is your king i i can't answer that
[1:44:42] the prophet can't answer that nobody
[1:44:44] else can answer that only you can answer
[1:44:46] that who is your king
[1:44:49] you see that's what this this message
[1:44:52] never came
[1:44:53] to make a man a king
[1:44:56] are you hearing me
[1:44:57] it never came to make a manna king a
[1:45:00] church a king
[1:45:04] this message came to declare
[1:45:07] who our king is
[1:45:10] and that he is here
[1:45:14] that choices that have been made to
[1:45:16] keep him out from the people
[1:45:18] sow everything off and and keep him
[1:45:21] veiled from the people
[1:45:24] but he has come
[1:45:27] and he has rent the veil
[1:45:32] just as he rent the veil where he tore
[1:45:35] down the middle wall of partition he
[1:45:37] himself came in this generation
[1:45:40] to bring sons and daughters of god back
[1:45:43] into full adoption
[1:45:45] back into a place that you can know god
[1:45:47] as a personal god
[1:45:50] not as a church relationship
[1:45:52] not as a scribe of tenets and we believe
[1:45:55] this and we believe that and we believe
[1:45:56] this it's more than that
[1:45:59] that's not who jesus is jesus christ is
[1:46:02] a person
[1:46:04] [Music]
[1:46:05] hallelujah
[1:46:07] and just as much as that seed life will
[1:46:10] move within your life and you allow it
[1:46:12] it will produce
[1:46:14] every word
[1:46:16] that is given right here
[1:46:18] because if that is the life of the word
[1:46:21] working in your life
[1:46:27] that's why when you hear
[1:46:29] the term the message
[1:46:31] this is not
[1:46:33] a term that's been coined by william
[1:46:36] branham
[1:46:38] that's a scriptural term
[1:46:41] are you with me the bible says in the
[1:46:43] book of haggai hag the lord's messenger
[1:46:46] spake in the lord's message
[1:46:49] same i am with thee
[1:46:52] it's a message not from a seminary amen
[1:46:56] it's a message from the throne of god
[1:46:59] the seven stars are in his right hand
[1:47:02] what are they doing they are reflecting
[1:47:05] him into the church
[1:47:07] [Applause]
[1:47:09] it's him that's being revealed to you
[1:47:11] and i not a church teaching a church
[1:47:14] teaching will leave you in your sins
[1:47:18] it'll leave you struggling and fighting
[1:47:21] and trying to get it because why it's
[1:47:23] based still on that first kingship
[1:47:27] [Applause]
[1:47:30] this is why
[1:47:31] when people come to a place and oh this
[1:47:33] is too tight for me
[1:47:35] this is too hard
[1:47:37] i gotta find a church that allows us to
[1:47:38] go to movies
[1:47:40] i gotta find us a church that it's all
[1:47:41] right to flirt with women i gotta find
[1:47:44] us a church where it's all right to
[1:47:45] smoke and drink you can find one
[1:47:49] but remember when you do that you reject
[1:47:51] him
[1:47:53] you can find plenty of them
[1:47:55] but remember the reason they got to
[1:47:57] looking at the world
[1:48:00] and if you look at the world wherever
[1:48:01] you look at
[1:48:02] is where you're going to go
[1:48:05] are you hearing me you say what are you
[1:48:06] saying i'm saying get back in step
[1:48:08] get your eyes off the world
[1:48:11] get back in step
[1:48:12] [Applause]
[1:48:13] satan can try to send distractions in
[1:48:16] your life loved ones and everything else
[1:48:18] oh we ought to pray for our loved ones
[1:48:20] but don't get your eyes
[1:48:23] on anything but jesus christ

[1:48:43] that's right down the lunchbox teacher
[1:48:44] and right there it brings a rat down
[1:48:46] where the rubber meets the road you
[1:48:48] don't have to try to be anxious and
[1:48:49] looking for this and looking for that
[1:48:51] get your eyes off facebook get your eyes
[1:48:53] off twitter get your eyes off all that

[1:50:38] [Music]
[1:50:40] everybody say with me he's a person
[1:50:44] he's not a doctrine he's the person of
[1:50:46] jesus christ
[1:50:48] that's why we're not trying to learn
[1:50:50] people anything we're not trying to
[1:50:51] learn people but it's to meet jesus
[1:50:53] christ
[1:50:55] and when you meet him you've got
[1:50:56] everything
[1:50:58] you've got all you have need of
[1:51:00] you've got strength that when trials
[1:51:02] come up you've got a power on the inside
[1:51:05] like an engine on a boat that's able to
[1:51:07] cut right through the reeds
[1:51:09] there might be times you'll get stuck
[1:51:11] but you've got a power on the inside
[1:51:13] what is that power it's the king
[1:51:17] [Music]
[1:51:18] and when this word has come by your
[1:51:21] pathway to something about a believer
[1:51:24] that seed on the inside says
[1:51:26] who is this king of glory
[1:51:29] [Applause]
[1:51:30] who is this king of glory you say
[1:51:32] brother samuel that's that that's way
[1:51:34] off up there but remember when he
[1:51:36] entered he entered according to the path
[1:51:39] of the word you and i are in the path of
[1:51:43] the prophesied word and when the word
[1:51:45] has come across our pathway we don't
[1:51:48] know how to describe it we don't know
[1:51:50] what we don't know how to put it into
[1:51:51] words but something rises in our hearts
[1:51:55] who is this king of glory
[1:51:59] the lord
[1:52:00] mighty in battle
[1:52:03] [Music]

[1:52:13] whole of sin he breaks the yoke of
[1:52:15] bondage he tears down the walls of fear
[1:52:18] he destroys doubt and unbelief and he
[1:52:20] gives a real assurance i am the
