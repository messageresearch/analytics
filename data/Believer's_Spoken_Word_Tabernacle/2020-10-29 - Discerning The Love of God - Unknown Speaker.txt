stand you can fly in a higher place do not struggle by grace set your wings to the winds of faith watch the eagle in the sky he does not struggle he does not strive for the power that makes him rise

matter what the circumstance might be no matter the situation no matter what the need is lord may our eyes be looking and focused on you i pray that god that for every need that's upon the hearts those that the visible and the invisible audience i asked lord that you would come very personally and minister to our hearts in a very special way lord may you just help me help me to get out of the way lord that lord you could take take my life take the gift you placed in my life lord as an instrument lord to speak through lord lord we just ask that you'd forgive us if there's anything we've said or done thought in any way that would be displeasing to you lord our confession is lord we love you we need you lord god we ask the lord that tonight your god may you just move according to every need lord that's upon the hearts of your children dear god may our faith rise lord in you i pray we love you and we thank you now father in jesus precious name amen amen it's your turn with me in first corinthians chapter 14 and we'll say it's good to be in the house of the lord and i want to welcome sister stephanie fowler and amen from the family that's there amen god bless you so good to have you and if there's any other visitors tonight god bless you as well i want to just read just one verse of scripture and then we're just we'll let you have your seats tonight in first corinthians chapter 14 and verse 1 and paul would write in this in this manner follow after charity and desire spiritual gifts but rather that ye may prophesy i want you to notice this let me read it once again notice what paul was drawing the attention of the believers to follow after charity this word follow right here it's a word where it's it's used metaphorically to pursue to seek after eagerly earnestly endeavor to acquire so follow after charity pursue it let that be the goal the focus let that be in all things of what is ever before us i said god help us in every heaven amen follow after charity and desire spiritual gifts but rather that you may prophesy amen i'd like to speak to you tonight or at least begin to on discerning the love of god may god bless you as you're being seated brother branham would mention in the message god projecting his love and he would say it like this one poet wrote if the ocean was all ink and the skies was a parchment and every stalk on earth was a quill and every man ascribed by trade to write the love of god above would drain the ocean dry or could the scroll contain the whole those stretched from sky to sky he said i've often thought this great poet that wrote this ever since by faith i saw that stream i want you to pay close attention these words ever since by faith i saw that stream thy flowing wounds supply redeeming love has been my thing and shall be till i die he goes on to say and if i think he said if one thing is needed in the great universal church of god tonight is love we do not need other things as much as we think we do and all these other things our emotions our gifts they're all wonderful and to god we give praise but if those gifts are not governed by love then they're not effective love should govern the home love is the greatest force that was ever put into the power of man that's an awful big statement the force the love is the greatest force that was ever put into the power of man to recognize that if you have been born of the spirit of god you have been endowed with this great power of the love of god now think of it it's put into our hands so when something is put into our hands that means we are going to have to use it a home that's not disciplined or governed by love is not much of a home if the husband and wife doesn't solemnly love each other they cannot trust each other that's why i think that instead of resting our faith upon some emotion which it's all right or some gift which that's all right like shouting speaking with tongues or with other things that we saying take for example say that we have the holy spirit when we do this those things are all right but if we would come back to the principle love first and then those things i think our church would progress a lot faster if we would get god first and god is love now we hear so much about this and this is a term that uh you see that in many things in many ways the enemy has perverted what real true love is the way that love is viewed is in this world that we live in now it's sappy soupy guppy you know when you speak powdered sugar flies you know and it's just but yet that's totally contrary to the love of god there's times the love of god does bring and it produces a real sweetness and a tenderness in our life but the love of god will never in itself condone sin the love of god will never be exceptive of sin but the love of god is able to look at a condition where there is sin or where there is something that's wrong and it's able to wait on the leading of the holy spirit the love of god the dove of god that rests in its heart that lord should i say something should i do something or is it the greatest thing that's for me it's a test that will i have the right attitude and will i pray for that other person and be just as much a brother and a sister to them as i would be to anybody else it really puts it in perspective when you think that when it came down to the disciples they asked among themselves is it i lord who would betray you to think the lord jesus knew who it was but he never acted nor treated judas any differently as so to signal this is the guy that's what the love of god does amen i want more of that don't you now notice how the lord jesus because when we look at this thought the discerning of the love of god we recognize that it requires it's just something more than us just reading scriptures as it is with in everything but we recognize that it must be that where we need the holy spirit to actually be able to perceive the love of god to be able to discern it and not only to discern it for our own lives and our own soul but we also have to have that same discernment when it comes to appropriating that in many different situations because sometimes things can come our way and we're as blindsided as blindsided could be and this is where we need the help of the holy spirit the discernment of the spirit of god now notice the lord jesus here in john 13 34 a new commandment i give unto you now if you think of this term a new commandment i give unto you this is not a commandment per se that could have been given though it was spoken in the law thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself but now it comes to a place to where that now it moves into a place to where that they would actually be able to fulfill what what is actually being required or a commandment that they would give themselves to this a new commandment i give unto you that ye love one another as i have loved you that ye also love one another now notice to what degree as i have loved you by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if you have love one to another when i read this i think of how that brother branham when he would stand there in the message humble thyself and you know he would speak for a little bit then brother vale would come and then brother branham would would finish off humble thyself and one of the things that was mentioned within that message that brother brown said that the community that was there that they would ask brother branham and say how in the world do you get the people to have such love among themselves how is it that they have such love among among themselves how does that happen now you and i both know if you listen to the message and you catch that there are burdens that brother branham himself will go through with the church there are things that brother branham will say like i think super sense brother brahms said you know brother neville just seems like he's not able to say this to the church he said it just so happens i can come back and say it and he's bringing correction to the church where there's little isms and disagreements and little things that went wrong brother brahm even talked about how that when he had come back into time into town he was actually going from this brother's house to this brother's house this sister's house to this sister's house trying to get things that was divisions and trying to bring them resolved there's many many things that you read within the message you say brother santa brother samuel what are you actually saying i'm telling you the brand of tabernacle was not a perfect utopia but what matters is is that if you're in perfect fellowship with a perfect god you've got the perfect holy spirit that's able to lead us by the perfect love of god then we have what we need to meet the challenge and to deal with every situation that would arise so when we look at this we we look at it because it is not something that can be legislated or governed you even think of it in the time that we're living in they can write all the laws that they want to write you can never legislate morality you can never legislate and say well you should treat this person differently or this person differently laws do not do that matter of fact brother branham when he addresses the things that are going on in the south and the message third exodus he said they're trying to legislate laws to take things out of people that the law itself has packed into them and he talked about those ministers that were rising up and they're you know dealing with and taking these things and working he said what it was it's a trick of the enemy to keep those people talking with the black people he said it's a trick of the enemy to keep them from what they really need and that's the real true baptism of the holy ghost i'm so glad that god comes down the mind of christ that helps us to see what the real issue is hey look let's not leave that there let's bring it down into our life we need the mind of christ operating in our life to really see what's the real issue here what's the real need because we recognize we're not fighting flesh and blood our warfare is not flesh and blood but we fight against spiritual wickedness against spiritual powers we are fighting against devils but we are more than conquerors amen so this new commandment it it is the love of god now notice this commandment that's given this is not like moses who receives the commandments but yet moses within his heart he himself has not experienced the full uh change that you and i have experienced by the baptism of the holy ghost it was still the law was out here and still the blood was there but this is different in the man christ jesus law and mercy was met grace and truth was met and here was not the blood out here and the law here but here it was operating in one vessel and this is what god's promise was that i will write my commandments upon your law upon your heart upon your mind and i will set forth within your life this is exactly what the lord jesus was expressing here because it would be this the love of god that was right here walking in flesh he was the very expression of god's love to us it was the love of god that created that body it was the love of god before there was adam stardust or molecule the very love of god before there was ever a devil the love of god already made provision in the mind of god revelations 13 8 that the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world it was the love of god was the provision that would govern that would oversee and he himself is the very expression of the divine love of god so the love of god in christ it's god's love coming back into humanity for god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself now to think it was this same love that was expressed to us he manifested his love toward us you know it's one thing it was no doubt that jesus himself he knew he was loved of the father did he not he said my father loveth me and i love him i do not come to to serve my own will i come to serve his will that is one thing that he knew the love of the father but you see in knowing the love of the father it put him in a place that he was not there to serve his own needs he was there to serve the purpose and the needs of his brethren oh my now to think of it as that love was manifested toward us that same love would come into the body of believers and become the very soul governing authority of his body because as his body we are we are indeed like as adam's side was open and what was taken out of adam was a rib and then it was multiplied cell on top of cell life on top of life and here was presented to adam this was his wife that which was taken out of him so we know that the true church of the living god is the wife of god and how is the wife she is subject reverent to him in all things she believes his word she reflects him she brings forth children that bear his image now notice let's look at this here in first john 4 7 beloved let us love one another for love is of god now i want you to think of this who is he writing to well there's he's writing to the beloved of god now indeed we understand that yes there can be and there is three kinds of people in every church but remember when we read this in the scripture do not read this as though that god when all of a sudden inspired john to write this to the unbeliever or he inspired it to the make-believer no this the word is given to the believer you see the make-believer doesn't really see the point in well you know everything's all right i'm doing okay and the unbeliever says ah that ain't even necessary but the believer says lord help me lord help me lord that i can live that word help me lord that that word can become effectual in my life why because the desire in the life of a believer is to please him so notice beloved let us love one another for love is of god and everyone that loveth is born of god and knoweth god big big word knoweth god able to perceive god to discern him to know him remember the the pharisees they looked at him they said you'll be else above and you've got a devil but here was a little woman that nobody would have come to the well at the same time she came and she came there and jesus he had an appointment that was arranged it was on the appointment book of god's word he was there on a mission he was there glory be to god to recover that attribute that was in his mind in his thinking he was there to minister to her and notice when he reveals himself to her she she leaves her pot she runs and said come see a man that's told me all that i ever done what a different reaction you know why she perceived god was in christ now notice you know brother branham would say it like this in god projecting his love he said love you know it's in two different words two different meanings filio and a gopal now that menophilia that's the love that you would have for your wife agapo is the love the divine love now the love that you have for your wife and the love of god is so contrary somebody say contrary just listen the love that you have for your wife if a man would insult her you'd kill him on the spot with that kind of a love a feeling of love but with agapa love you'd pray for his soul not after you killed him that be the difference i mean say help me lord amen help me lord that would be the difference and notice you see be operating between filio and agape love because many can read the scripture and say well i love god but notice brother random here is setting forth from the scripture there's a difference between filial love and agape what is that filial love looks out for self-interest agape love looks out for the interest of others oh my it is it is a love that actually projects glory be to god it's a love that projects value you see sometimes you look at things and you say i don't see no value in that hey look and look at your life and look at my life who would have thought what kind of value late in our life but god saw the value of us there you might look at a piece of land and say there ain't no gold there why do you pay that much there ain't no natural resources there but god said oh my if you only knew down there on the inside it's some real gold there's some real diamonds on the inside and he purchased the land in order to bring forth that expression oh what love now notice there's two different types of love and i'm almost sure that many of us has been deceived with having filial love and thinking it's agape love filial is an intellectual now intellectual when you think of it just don't think of of mind remember intellect works in the emotional realm the spirit realm it deals with even that of the emotion because it's dealing in the spirit realm agape love comes from the heart that's human love this is why when a person says i love god okay you love god but you see it depends on where is the love of god and what love are they speaking of a person can love god with their mind but yet what comes out in the life it does not reflect the word of god it actually will take and say well that don't matter this doesn't matter you know that really don't this these things are necessary but the agape love of god is so in tune and harmony with the holy spirit because that's what it is it's so in tune that it's following his leadership and his direction it's not something that we say one thing and we live a different way that's the difference between filio and agape love so that's human love affectionately love and godly love godly love doesn't question human love reasons but godly love doesn't it's perfect in its trust it produces faith when you really love now first john 4 8 continuing he that loveth not notice knoweth not god for god is love he is not able to perceive he has not perceived god he has not known him in this was manifested the love of god toward us because that god sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him think of it god in in one way look at it god god was not god was not in need it was you and i who were in need god was not guilty we were guilty we were born into this in this measure there is we needed help to get out the law was not good enough thank god for the law the law spiritual law is holy but the law couldn't get us out it was weak through the flesh we needed the righteousness of god god's own life the very love of god god is love we needed the love of god glory to step down and become manifest to you and i oh my that god sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him herein is love not that we loved god but that he loved us it wasn't that's how i was searching for god no god was searching for you not that we this is love knows this is the basis and what is god setting forth here scratch what you've looked at before that's conditional love is it a form of love it is but it's a form of love that's dropped down agape love is up here god's desire was not just to come down here but his desire was to come down that he might bring us back to where you and i belong we belong in that of the agape love it was only in the agape love that the real expression from our life as sons and daughters of god could really come out feeling a love can never do it no matter how much a pastor loves us no matter how much all these other things it takes the agape love of almighty god to move down and that to be captured and lift us up into that place where we can be recognized as sons and daughters of god oh my think of it herein is love not that we love god but that he loved us and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins my my what love huh amen buddy beloved if god so loved us we ought also to love one another no man hath seen god at any time if we love one another god dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in us his love comes to a completion comes to an end how does that happen because his love that is projected to you and i that came through him by the perpetuation and how that his love is there it is unfolded it is revealed it comes to you and i what does it do it brings about that perfection what is a perfection it's the end of you and me and the beginning of the son and daughter of god it's the beginning of the real you and me on the end time it's the real you and me that was there all along that was struggling and wanting to come forth it was that part like jacob that spiritual part but what brought it forth not law law does not bring it forth it takes the love of god to bring it forth love will correct us love will point out our faults love will say you're not measuring up but when that love of god is made known it is perceived by the spiritual mind they discern it hey there's a higher plane that i can live on i don't have to walk down here live down here there is a higher place that i can live aren't you glad that god comes and shows us there notice this is the effect of divine revelation the the effect of divine revelation is where that the unseen no man has seen god at any time but the only begotten of the father he hath declared him right he became visible in jesus christ well guess who god's becoming visible in now you his attributes as a matter of fact when he fought of you and me brother braham tells us in future home that was god thinking of himself becoming tangible his attributes his children god don't have a family he is a family it is god himself his life his genes divided his life imparted among his children he himself god is a family we are part of the family of god notice it is that unseen which is now visible by divine revelation in the heart of the believer you see this is how we know that it's divine revelation because divine revelation pacts within it a power it's the power of the true covenant that reveals itself through our lives in order to bring forth what the word is spoken now revelation it releases to us that power and that authority where we're no longer walking by just these eyes right here but we are walking by eyes of faith it is that which is so taken a hold and gripped our hearts and our life it affects everything when somebody can say hey what happened to you you see they don't know what took place but you have now come in contact with the unseen realm and once you come in contact with the unseen realm by the holy spirit brother and sister you can never be the same you walk still in this temple you'll live still in this visible world but what you are is a reflection in the visible world of the invisibles oh glory verse 13 hereby know we that we dwell in him and he in us because he hath given us of his spirit in romans 5 5 it would express beloved hope maketh not a shame because the love of god is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost which is given to us so it's shed abroad how what is the love of god it is the holy ghost it is god himself god is love it is that which is poured into our hearts now how does it pour it into our hearts remember you and i were like a glass dirty glass and god came by our way and picked us up what picked you up love picked you up and then the same love did what cleaned you up that same love sanctified you took away the love of the things of the world and then what did that same love do it made way for itself to be poured fully into our life to where now the love of god is shed abroad or poured forth in our life by the holy spirit in first john 2 15 love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him once again a person can say they love god and indeed they may indeed love god filial spirit mind but you see when the love of the father is come which is the love of god which is the holy ghost the love of the world is gone is that right oh my that's a promise you just reach up and take a hold of that's one of those you say that's mine that's mine thank you lord so when we try to find this and look at it so we're seeing that the love of god coming in it's god's own life that comes in to us it is that love that comes to his children now you know when we look at it we know there's a great difference between a law and a love affair uh brother branham would give the example many times over and he would deal with how that you know regarding he and sister meeting he said when i go overseas media does not set me down and say bill now let me tell you something you better not be fooling with any other women you better not be doing this you better not be doing taking any of them out you better not be he said she don't have to do that neither do i have to say media and you know repeat the same thing vice versa he said what it is he says the love that i have for her she don't have to worry and i know the love that she has for me so you don't have to worry you see law itself it creates contention it creates a part of where is there any confidence it does not produce trust but the love of god setting forth within the heart and the life what does it bring it brings confidence it brings trust it does not bring slavish fear this is why brother brown would say oh brother when the love of god has come into your heart it'll drive these all these things you don't have to worry about smoking drinking and running to bioscopes notice how he said when the love of god has come into your heart it will drive out all those other things this is love is so much greater it takes the place it drives it out it's not worrying about oh my am i going to smoke am i going to drink no the love of god drives it out and the love of god takes its place oh my you don't have to worry about smoking drinking and running to buy scopes that be movies so you all might understand that when the love of christ comes into your heart you wouldn't do nothing to hurt him not walking around saying oh they're narrow-minded and they're this way and that way you just let the love of god strike you once those things die your whole affection is placed on christ you've got eternal life then when you believe him when you really believe him and get married to him and die out to the things of the world god projects his love and his love makes you what you are [Music] i just believe that my love toward my little sweetheart it's made her what she is that meal can laugh and blush and everything else but i believe that this is exactly where the scripture it isn't about me but i believe that with the way the bible talks about that husbands love your wives never says wives love your husbands it says husbands love your wives why because the wives now don't get caught up on that now it's following all the way into the scripture now now watch and husbands love your wives why why how does that happen it has to be a projection of the life of the husband that's projected to the wife and the wife herself is made like the moon to receive that ray that comes out from the sun and reflect that light in the absence of the sun glory so when even we're not around one another there is a light of divine love that reflects in the midst of a darkened world think about it it is the love of god that has made us what you and i are it doesn't matter if we're in church or without a church it doesn't matter if you put them down in babylon like daniel they're still going to be a christian this is what love the love of god produces oh glory be to god verse 14 and we have seen and do testify that the father sent the son to be the savior of the world you see what i mentioned earlier if if i if there was no expression of my love i just feel pulled to come back if there was not an expression of that of really bringing that around she would have no confidence whatsoever she would come i really can't cook that good i really now she don't walk around and say hey you know what you ought to taste what i can eat she ain't she ain't that kind of a person she don't walk around i'll tell you what you ain't never tasted a cake like mine i don't know if i want to that is not how that's not how it is but to think about it it is a love this is what ephesians 5 it's a sanctifying cleansing positioning love it ain't saying oh these are the best biscuits and you know they're like a burnt offering with when you know with steam and smoke wrong that's not what we're saying we're being true and genuine but it is a love that works to minister and build up not tear down my let's get back to verse 14. and we have seen and do testify that the father sent the son to be the savior of the world whosoever shall confess that jesus is the son of god god dwelleth in him and he in god and we have known this perception to be able to discern we have known and believed so this knowing is more than just us perceiving because to perceive and to know you know it's one thing the greeks said knowledge is knowing facts but the jews said to really know something it must be operative in a person's life and this by the way you might say well i'm not hebrew you really are hebrew you realize that when spiritually speaking abraham was a gentile come on now abraham was a gentile but the reflection of his life they called him abraham the hebrew hebrew meaning one who is from beyond glory be to god so we are the real spiritual hebrews of god one who is from beyond glory be to god and we have known and believed the love that god hath to brother branham to the pastor to my wife to my husband to the church what's it say to us this is personal personal we have known and believed the love that god hath to us god is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god and god in him you see those scriptures that we just had read it speaks of testify speaks of confess remember to testify and confess means to say the same thing it's living a true confession of the love of god that burns within our heart at the coming of the revelation of jesus christ that it was for me he came he was crucified for me he took my sins to hell he rose on that easter morning for me he sent back the holy ghost for me and he sent the message to me be knowing i would live in this generation that he might make himself his love known to me and god has given me grace i have that i might know and believe my reason believe receive the love of god for me all glory it's such a powerful thing to receive the pardoning grace of almighty god the pardoning love of god by the new birth into our soul then you realize what we have inside of us we have received a part a portion of the partner and he if he was a partner for you and me then he's a partner in us and through us he operates with pardon and grace in our life are you with me when offenses come grievances come the partner's there on the inside he's there to help us in those times but when the flesh wants to pull in a certain way and depending on your makeup it might be pulled more that way than others but every one of us still need the same grace of god and operating of the love of god in our life to think of the grace and mercy of god because the reality offense is you ain't going to stop offenses from coming the bible said offenses will come oh brother oh if i could just go to a church where there's no offenses i know the very perfect one i don't know if they've got one up up and down on this road i don't think i've seen it i've traveled up and down this road but i know around in here they've got some graveyards pretty close to here and those first church of the graveyard nobody talks about nobody nobody says anything nobody even thinks differently of anybody it's a perfect church you know why it's dead where it's alive satan wants to get in and try to cause confusion that's where satan gets he starts to tremble when he sees a body that's coming together in unity under the headship of the love of god that's where satan he's busy to try to break it up not where it's dead but he comes to try to make it indifferent because if he can throw a little something in the stream to plug it up a little bit he says my goodness there's no way i can stop it if i can just hinder it slow it down but i believe tonight that we are here as believers to say god if there's anything in the stream of my life lord let it be cleared out lord god don't let there be anything that hinders the flow of the love of god in my life why because we value him we value his body notice verse 17 herein is our love made perfect that's a paradox i'm not going to go into that hirion is our love made perfect how is it our love it was his love now we've received it we've become the very expression of that love remember husbands love your wives even as christ so loved the church we now have received that love just like when god promised the woman i'll give thee a seat the woman has no seed but once god gave her seed she said that's my seed is that right herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness confidence in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world notice as he is there brother aaron where he's seated there on the right hand of the majesty on high sitting on the throne of god he is seated in power sent back the holy ghost which is the power of god the dunamis of god the love of god operating in our life think about it he is there in the unseen but notice the power of god has been released back to the children of god upon this earth now look remember this perfection we talked about some weeks ago what perfection is it when we have come under the blood and the life that was in that blood that token has come back upon you and i there is therefore now no more condemnation to them that are in christ jesus glory be to god who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit there is no fear in love but perfect love cast out fear because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love look at this we love him not a doctrine not a teaching we love him well how can you love him because he has been made manifest to us you see it just didn't stop like many saw jesus a galilean oh who is this guy who is this but you see that didn't bring no results no change is that right hey listen apollos was preaching in the upper coast acts 19 he was preaching that jesus indeed was the christ but it never changed them it did not bring the holy ghost but once paul came and paul said uh how are you all baptized asked him have you heard have you received the holy ghost since you believe we never heard none we never heard of that see a junction of the word had already taken place but you see even though a junction of the word had taken place and it seemed like they were out of the loop they may not have been walking in step at that moment but you can't get them out of the mind of god god knowing that they were in his mind god said no i won't lose one i'll make sure my word gets to my children i will not lose one of them so it was more than just recognizing that jesus was the christ but it is to recognize that it was indeed god in christ remember this was something that even it stumbled even the believers in that day they couldn't understand he talks this way it says this says that they didn't even recognize they couldn't recognize it was god in christ even though that seed would speak up that was in peter on the inside it was not there remember until as it's walking on the road of emmaus he begins to reveal himself that indeed not only is he the same jesus but he reveals himself in the fulfillment of the prophecy and it's to tie them in because they need to recognize him not just the coming of the messiah they must recognize that the coming of the messiah is indeed for the outpouring of the love of god the holy ghost so we know him we love him because he first loved us isn't that wonderful oh my to think of it in the very mind of god even right now we stand as sons and daughters of god the mediator has come amen he who knew no sin became sin that when we might be made the very righteousness of god in christ he took upon my sin that i might become his righteousness i don't care how you want a word that that ain't a fair trade but i'm so thankful he did [Applause] i'm so glad he did hallelujah think about it brother man says god cannot see no sin in you as long as your confession is in christ jesus he goes on someone said to me sometime i go if i believed a thing like that i would turn on the steam i'd paint the town red i'd go to every dance hall i'd get so drunk and everything because bill graham said why you're already secured in christ what difference does it make you see you wouldn't want to do that does sammy do you drink i sure do i drink all that i want to drink i just don't want to drink let me get that sound bite you see you do all you want to do you just don't want to do it the desire what it is you want to please scott yeah no my i said that shows you haven't got it if the love of god ever struck your heart in the tenderness notice in the tenderness of jesus christ you would be so in love with him the world would be dead as your sin that's how you know you have the holy spirit not because you could scream shout speak in tongues whatever it is but when sin becomes dead and you're alive in jesus christ oh love of god how rich how pure first timothy 1 5 now the end the completion the perfection the end of the commandment is charity out of notice out of a pure heart and of a good conscience and of faith unfeigned paul goes on and writes in romans 13 8 oh no man nothing but to love one another for he that loveth god hath fulfilled the law for this thou shalt not commit adultery not kill not steal not bear false witness not covet and if there's any other commandment it is briefly comprehended in this saying thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself worketh no ill to his neighbor therefore love is the fulfilling of the law who's the end of the law christ is that right he fulfilled the law he met the requirements glory be to god galatians 5 13 for brethren ye have been called unto liberty only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another for all the law is fulfilled in one word even in this thou shalt love by neighbor as thyself first thessalonians 4 9 as touching brotherly love you need not that i write unto you for ye yourselves are taught of god to love one another amen the expression of what god has expressed to you and i his love and now that same love of god is an inside teacher the spirit of truth the love of god the holy ghost all speaks of the very same person it teaches us aren't you glad i'm glad it teaches us because sometimes teaching is where you got to correct things that are wrong sometimes it has to say that's a little jaded a little slanted towards you and what does it do the love of god on the inside aren't you glad it's inside aren't you glad it's set abroad oh lord god let my life be so wrapped in the love of god let me be more sensitive to the love of god oh my to think of this this is so contrary to the pharisees remember jesus called them out their righteousness their perfection was they loved everybody only the only little hidden print it's like the fine line right if they love me if they don't love me i don't love them that's what the law produced that's right yet the law would say thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself but a new commandment god would give glimpses of this through the prophets oh my i can't go there god would give glimpses of this of how they would lay their lives down when the revelation would strike their life think of it when god told moses step aside they've already seen all kinds of the supernatural they see me move out of the way moses i'm going to get to him step aside moses said if you touch them you've got to come through me first you can't touch them god unless you come through me what was it it was the atonement what was the atonement it's the revelation of the promise the love of god was in moses heart when they were as wrong as wrong could be it rose up first john 3 10. in this the children of god are made manifest and the children of the devil whosoever doth not righteousness is not of god neither he that knoweth neither he that loveth not his brother now look in the old testament under the law a man was righteous by doing righteously right but under the new covenant by the holy spirit remember it is not man's righteousness it's the righteousness of god which is the love of god which is the holy ghost it's the righteousness of god that is fulfilled in our lives so it is not us oh i'm going to be righteous no it is doing righteous because there's come a change on the inside that brings forth righteousness a son and daughter of god it's not what we're struggling i think as a song when i came up here if i'm not mistaken as he was talking about not our struggle it's our yielding whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of god neither he that loveth not his brother now notice how the spirit of god and john will tie these two together the righteousness of god and the love of god goes hand in hand for he says notice no whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of god neither he that loveth not his brother now i want you to think of this we understand in the scripture of the fruits of the spirit galatians 5 and we we recognize the fruits of the spirit love and gentleness and meekness and temperance and kindness and longsuffering all of those things are genuine fruits of the holy spirit but to recognize that a person could have fruits of the spirit and yet really not have the righteousness of god or be accepted of god the only way when john is speaking of this here it goes hand in hand it is to be walking in the word for your day having the revelation of the love of god because it's christ may manifest to you and when that's made manifest to you what does it do when the quickening power comes into our life what does it do it brings forth the works of god through our life it is god's holy spirit his move his working bringing forth the works of god through our life and what does that also display the love of god because it had to take the love of god to bring about the quickening the change in our life so you can't separate them that's what brother branham could say is tremendous he says christian science they exercise more love than anybody i know of and yet they deny jesus christ being divine he says there's only one evidence of the holy spirit that i know of and that's genuine faith in the promised word of the hour remember they asked jesus what must we do then we might work the works of god believe on him whom he hath sent that is the work of god what will it do it'll bring forth the works of god within your life and by bringing forth the works of god how could you be affected by the love of god the love of god shed abroad in your heart and not express that same love because when it's him the real holy ghost in a person's life when they're born again it is a christ a part of christ that is seated seated there in the life of that individual where that seed has come into divine expression oh glory so genuine faith yeah genuine faith in the revealed word of the hour oh my you see let me just read you a few more statements he said when it come to fruits of the spirit talking about the pharisees they could show more fruits of the spirit than jesus ever could they failed to see that he was the promised word of the hour iran said you know and never find maybe more gentler guys love but what kind of love there's a lot of people can express love i don't mind failure i mean you you like people being nice to you in the store and you know nice to you when they're serving your food and everything else and don't you all appreciate that well if you don't something's wrong with you i appreciate that it's nice every once in a while as i stood there you know in china and we had to we had to you know go through shanghai and we're going through there and brother jerry and i must have went through i think it's four or five different checkpoints you talk about such a heaviness when we were going through there i couldn't wait to get on that plane and get out of there we barely made it we were there for hours we thought man have plenty of time to get a coffee and everything else not so they went through our bags i don't know how many times we went through i don't know how many checkpoints when we got out of there i looked over at him and we sat down a plane i said you know what's funny i never seen one of them guys smile or girls i said you know i even tried to be a little friendly you know go up to the death of my what a busy day ain't smiling at all [Music] then i get over the philippines and brother rojo says brother samuel he said you realize they've actually got billboards up in china because they don't know how to smile it's to teach them how to smile oh my looks like some of y'all could use that billboard too notice this think of it the love that they can manifest love that kind of priest oh my that kind of priest they could do all of that but this that that was not even though they could exhibit all of that this is not what god was talking about it's the love of god it's the love of the father and what does that do it directs it into the word and it sees the brethren it sees that that is of the family it reaches out to others where many would say what are you doing here like the pharisees thou was altogether born in fornication but jesus saw what was beneath him just like the woman at the well and he reached to what the need was in her life for this is the message that you have heard from the beginning that we should love one another amen aren't you glad the message hadn't changed still the same message we should love one another not has cain who was of that wicked one and slew his brother and wherefore slew he him because his own works were evil and his brothers righteous condemnation is a bad thing sometimes i've seen that condemnation i've seen it work what happens is it would be the greatest thing if a person would actually get free of that condemnation they'd stop tearing other people down because you know if you're already down then what it is you got to tear other people down but this is how this is what cain did because it wasn't happening in his church he had to tear the other one down preach it because if it wasn't about him then he had to tear it down that's king's religion but abel said i didn't give it to myself i didn't i i didn't you know i didn't one trying to figure it out as a matter of fact i was just walking along and just thanking the lord and god dropped it down in my heart abel you see that lamb yes papa i want you to bring that to me which lamb you want papa i want the best one hallelujah i know you can discern what's the best glory marvel not look at this marvel not my brother just gave me a few more moments if the world hate you and that's something how we would be admonished if the world hate us and remember the love as it's speaking of here in one case we experience that from the world we experience grievances offenses we experience all that we experience all of it from believers make believers and unbelievers but just because we experience an offense does not make somebody a make-believer and an unbeliever and we're a believer hello let me repeat that just because somebody offends us doesn't mean they're they're a make-believer and unbelievable right let me say it again marvel not my brethren if the world hates you we know that we have passed from death unto life because we love the brethren he that loveth not his brother abideth in death whosoever hateth his brother is a murder now this is not just oh i love the brethren oh i love the brethren and been living any kind of life living a life that's contrary to the word that's not what that is that's still intellectual emotional trying to bring the love of god down into that place no the love of god will operate and display itself under the headship of the word because that's what the love of god really is oh my he that loveth not his brother abideth in death whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer remember brother bram says you can kill a man without having a knife in your hand you can just kill his influence what should i do if you don't have nothing nice to say don't say nothing at all some of you got that he that loveth not his brother abideth and death whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him hereby perceive notice perceive we the love of god because he laid down his life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren samuel i just don't know if i can do it sure you can yeah sure you can jesus said i have power to lay my life down and i have power to raise it up again he had the authority to lay it down and he had the dutimus to raise it back up again let me close on these verses if a man first john 4 20 if a man say i love god and hateth his brother he is a liar for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen how can he love god whom he hath not seen wow and this commandment have we from him that he who loveth god loveth his brother also think of this scripture here this whole scripture reading begins with in verse 1. beloved what manner of love is this that the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of god it does not appear but we shall be but we know when he shall appear we shall be like him amen and every man that hath this hope in him purifyeth himself even as he is pure i don't know about you but i'm so grateful there is a purifying oil on the inside when i've had feelings that are not right and you have to maybe things that's been said shouldn't have been said aren't you glad there's a purifying oil on the inside that brings conviction to your life that says uh-uh that wasn't right just just how you said that that wasn't just right the words might have been right but just how you said it wasn't just exactly right it's a purifier aren't you glad yes you know what that is that's the love of god that's the holy ghost that's the love of god laying his life down for his brethren oh my don't you love him i know it's challenging every time i read this i've preached out of these scriptures and gone all the way through it every time i read it it challenges me to no end but samuel are you a hypocrite no not at all but i just see how i can live much closer to him and i see how sticky this guy is right here i see that but on the inside i see where that spiritual mind is growing it's discerning through its through experiences greater is he greater is he that's in me that's in you than he that's in the world what is it the love of god the love of god let's pray heavenly father how thankful we are oh love of god how rich and pure how measureless and strong it shall forevermore endure the saints and angels song what a theme lord redeeming love has been my theme and shall be till i die oh god help us tonight father i pray i first lord would want to pray if there's one that doesn't know you whether they're streaming maybe they're sitting here lord i pray that may the love of god just reach soul to their hearts tonight may you minister to them lord that redeeming love if there's one lord that does not know you [Music] oh god in that of a real love affair would you just minister to them tonight lord may you just just wash away every thought every servile thought every thought of fear slavery but may the lord god see you see the love of god lord jesus your desire is to set down in the midst of their life to direct them to control them to guide them to come in as the dove of god would come in in a love affair where it's no longer as paul could say i believeth but christ liveth in me lord i ask tonight that is this love that we have perceived this love that you have bestowed upon our life we could not be recognized though we were sons and daughters of god but we could not be recognized when we were away like the prodigal the lord god it was you that beckoned us to come home it was you lord god that would make yourself known to us this great love of god this great love is prominent right under inspiration what great love wherewith he loved us while we were dead in our sins he quickened us raised us up lord jesus we stand here tonight throughout this assembly lord i'm sure there's hearts the lord would want to be remembered in prayer say lord god with all of my life all of my heart lord [Music] i want that cleansing oil i want lord a continual purifying of my life i don't want to let lord offenses and grievances i don't want to things let things mount up in my life lord god [Music] i want the love of god to be reflected through my life as it was through the life of our lord jesus i want to reflect him that is unseen i want to reflect him visible in this world oh lord god [Music] think about it in times where churches and different ones lord god just taking parts away of your word they don't want you no more they want doctrines they want creeds they don't want you the lord jesus we want you you're the love of our life lord god you're the will in the middle of the wheel lord god you're the one who has set our life in motion lord god we love you lord jesus lord we want to say tonight thank you for opening our eyes we know we had absolutely nothing to do with it lord oh god you opened our eyes that we might see if it hadn't been for you opening our eyes lord god it would have passed right by us but oh how we're thankful lord god the testimony that we can hold in our life the love of god is perfected in us coming to completion bringing forth what you've called for lord god we love you lord help us lord help us [Music] help us lord as we walk in this world we face things from the world we come in contact rubs shoulders with unbelievers lord of times experiences with make believers and only you know who is what that's what i'm glad about but it doesn't matter believer make believer unbeliever we want to have that same love of god the love of god that stands on the standard of your word not a love lord that is goofy and oozy a love that is compromising but a love that stands on the standard of the word that's what the love of god did the love of god did not compromise but the love of god is the very life of god the righteousness of god the righteousness of the law of your own life now come upon the worshiper not a compromise you've raised the standard in us lord the standard is raised help us lord in the name of jesus christ amen don't you love him amen is that your request lord help me amen to come away from this service as we started to look at this tonight discerning the love of god i don't want to just go away in any service and any what's been ministered but lord i i want to be captured by i want to be like like they take a camera and they'll take a camera and they'll set it out and maybe they want to you know capture and time lapse and they want to capture that with the sky and the passing of the stars and you've seen it it looks like the stars are flying 100 miles an hour how does that happen because they took the aperture of the camera the eye [Music] and they opened it how does light come in the body through the eye and as we're looking at him opening up our lives what does it do it's him moving into our life i want to capture what god is doing what he's saying what he's expressing i want to capture that in my life capture it not about not not up here i want it to be captured down here i want to be changed effectual have that before in my life amen oh blessed be the

amazed there's only one thing left to say wasn't that love [Applause] wasn't that love as he laid there in the tomb he did just what he came to do wasn't that love wasn't that love but then he rose up from the grave so that we could live today wasn't that love oh wasn't that love wasn't that love how he left his home above and he died on calvary or just to save someone like me every day i'm still amazed there's only one thing left to say wasn't that love it wasn't that low one last time wasn't that love how he left his home above and died just to save someone like me every day i'm still amazed there's only one thing left to say or wasn't that [Music] [Music] there's only one thing left to say wasn't that love or wasn't that love
