[42:05] sing it once again.

[42:32] there is none like you. I search for all
[42:39] eternity

[42:45] there is none like you.
[42:51] [Music]
[42:55] Praise the Lord.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; That's the truth, isn't it?
[42:59] &gt;&gt; It's nobody like Jesus.
[43:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; Nobody like the Lord.
[43:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:07] &gt;&gt; That scripture I just um keeps
[43:10] resonating in my heart for some time is
[43:13] where it speaks of the
[43:15] chief cornerstone
[43:18] and um says he is precious. We read it
[43:21] in our text last week, but it's just a
[43:23] lot of things just meditating. And you
[43:26] know, when you
[43:28] you see what God has done for you,
[43:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:30] &gt;&gt; And what he's done in your life truly,
[43:32] that's where you could say he's
[43:34] precious.
[43:35] &gt;&gt; He's precious. Where where he brought me
[43:37] from, where he what what he what he did
[43:39] in my life. He's precious.
[43:42] &gt;&gt; He is precious. He is
[43:44] &gt;&gt; so precious. So wonderful. Amen. Don't
[43:47] you love him this morning?
[43:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:50] Amen. So good to be gathered together.
[43:53] Um
[43:55] I'm just going to uh ask you if you
[43:57] would like to just have your seats just
[43:58] for a few moments. I
[44:02] want to
[44:04] we didn't get to actually do it at a
[44:07] time that we normally would uh and that
[44:09] was actually to have prayer with those
[44:11] of the the students and kids and
[44:14] different ones that are going back to
[44:16] school, college and so forth. And so we
[44:18] would certainly like to to do that and
[44:20] we certainly know that um even in the
[44:24] time and the day and age that we live in
[44:26] um it's always been where we trusted the
[44:29] Lord and each time when they uh walk out
[44:31] of our our homes and it's not just for
[44:35] um the the craziness of the world that
[44:38] we see and it's when you see all of that
[44:41] you see things just things that's taken
[44:43] place this week and you know you you see
[44:46] situations and you realize that it's
[44:50] spirits.
[44:51] &gt;&gt; It's not people, it's spirits.
[44:54] &gt;&gt; And that's the things that within this
[44:57] within this this time that we are living
[45:00] in, it's a a time where the lid has been
[45:04] taken off of hell.
[45:07] And remember we sometimes when we step
[45:09] back from this this is also in the midst
[45:12] of the glorious revelation that is to
[45:14] catch our hearts away change our lives
[45:17] yet at the same times it brings um
[45:20] clarity to where we're standing like in
[45:22] Psalms 27 where David David speaks in
[45:26] the midst of that time that everything
[45:28] is all around him to try to consume him.
[45:33] See, these are things, events and things
[45:35] happen that would like to even to
[45:37] swallow us up and things that take
[45:39] place, things that would like to get in
[45:42] your mind and where fear could set in
[45:46] and nervousness and everything else. And
[45:49] you know, and I think this is where we
[45:50] just have to just continue within this
[45:52] time to know this. God has placed us
[45:55] here in this hour and his word is more
[45:59] than enough. It's sufficient to see us
[46:02] through. That doesn't mean that we
[46:04] don't, you know, use wisdom within
[46:06] things. But I know that I know this one
[46:08] thing for sure that God has not left us
[46:11] here helpless. And to put also in the in
[46:15] the perspective, the prophet would tell
[46:17] us and he would take us in scripture to
[46:20] show us and we we see this more and more
[46:24] and more. The prophet saw it in seed
[46:26] form. He saw these things in seed form
[46:29] that you and I are seeing in harvest
[46:31] time. And where he could say just as it
[46:35] was in the days of Noah that the people
[46:38] had to get in the spirit of destruction
[46:41] in order for destruction to come.
[46:44] Likewise must the people of God get in
[46:47] the spirit of God for rapture.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; So there's a there's there's there's two
[46:53] forces. There's two powers as the
[46:55] prophet brought it, you know, at work.
[46:57] And so within all of this, even as we
[47:00] are children, they go to school. And I'm
[47:01] not just talking about with evil and
[47:04] things like that of violence. I'm going
[47:05] to tell you some of the greatest evil is
[47:07] some of the uh seeds that are sown
[47:12] &gt;&gt; um within, if I can say it this way,
[47:15] these petri dishes called colleges.
[47:19] There's so much things that are and so
[47:22] and I say that because you you know I I
[47:23] I have a license to say that I I went
[47:26] clear to have a masters and there's a
[47:28] lot of things that it just had to throw
[47:30] out the window. There was a lot of
[47:32] things there was things that I looked at
[47:34] and I felt at the time I thought if I
[47:37] made statements like you're making here
[47:39] I don't know if I'd be allowed to walk
[47:41] the streets but you just so you you you
[47:44] see certain things that are happening
[47:45] within this time and I'm not we have to
[47:47] go into those places you have to go in
[47:50] or in order to get your certificate but
[47:52] I always want to just say it to you like
[47:53] this that your certificate your degree
[47:55] the way that I always looked at it is
[47:57] that that was printed on there as far as
[48:00] from a knowledge, but when I looked at
[48:02] it, that was already in me.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; That is so good.
[48:05] &gt;&gt; Because whatever God has called you to
[48:07] do, it's already in you.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; That's how God spoke when he spoke
[48:12] concerning the tabernacle in the
[48:14] wilderness when God had Moses up there
[48:16] in that cloud. And he says, I filled
[48:19] Bezel with the spirit of wisdom and
[48:21] understanding and skill. So, I believe
[48:24] this. He's Jehovah Gyra. How many
[48:25] believe that? So God doesn't place us in
[48:28] this earth without the skills that he
[48:32] already placed within us
[48:34] &gt;&gt; that then is God just lead us into the
[48:36] right places that that that can I can
[48:39] start to realize what you have for me
[48:41] because really even what he has for you
[48:43] the career and all those things God will
[48:45] work through all of that but yet our
[48:47] main purpose is to serve God if we serve
[48:50] God as a as a builder we serve God as a
[48:53] nurse we serve what however we serve God
[48:55] but that's just part of the occupation
[48:57] that God gave us that we could be able
[48:59] to stand here and provide for ourselves
[49:02] and actually it's not us providing for
[49:04] ourselves it's Jehovah Gyra
[49:07] &gt;&gt; God placed those skills within us and
[49:09] then those things begin to be harvested
[49:11] and then we find because everything in
[49:13] our life I always told the boys I said
[49:16] you we are with our priorities and
[49:18] things a lot of times your school and
[49:19] your times get taken up right now
[49:21] writing papers and all of that but you
[49:23] got that kind of stamina right now when
[49:26] you get older, some of the things start
[49:28] slaying down. But just remember,
[49:29] everything you're doing is with the
[49:31] priority is that I want to be in the
[49:33] house of God. I want to be free. I want
[49:35] to serve God. And that's the whole thing
[49:37] within this life. We want to just keep
[49:39] this life so that this life is not it's
[49:41] always trying to encroach on us anyhow,
[49:43] right? The best that we can do. It's
[49:44] always wanting to encroach and get on
[49:46] our minds and get in our spirits and all
[49:48] those things. So, we always have to to
[49:49] to to push back on it where we say,
[49:52] "God, help me to at least be in the
[49:54] right place and the channel of what
[49:55] you've had have for me." And uh I
[49:58] believe that God's mindful of that.
[50:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you believe that?
[50:02] &gt;&gt; I believe that with all my heart.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so, um uh please don't think
[50:07] that I'm throwing off on any
[50:08] universities or anything like that at
[50:10] all. I'm not at all. But I just simply
[50:12] say it. There was a when I was a young
[50:14] man and God had got a hold of my life
[50:17] and when I came home and I remember uh I
[50:21] was just watching a message and it was a
[50:23] VC it was on a VCR tape. Um, some of you
[50:26] have to know remember what that is, but
[50:29] uh, it was a message that Brother Biscll
[50:31] was preaching and the message title was
[50:34] taking the battle to the enemy's camp.
[50:37] And I never forget, I was sitting there
[50:38] in the living room and brother Biscll
[50:40] just stopped and he says, "You young
[50:41] people," he said, "let me admonish you,
[50:45] go in there, get what you need, leave
[50:48] the other stuff, and get out."
[50:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; And that's exactly how we feel. There's
[50:53] a lot of that. We we do what we need to
[50:55] do and get out. It's like when you go
[50:57] for training, right, on your job. You go
[50:59] for training on your job, you'll hear a
[51:01] lot of stuff. You hear a lot of
[51:03] different things. Say, "Lord, help me to
[51:05] get what I need and leave the filler
[51:08] behind."
[51:11] Amen. And God is so mindful, Amen. for
[51:15] all of our needs. Don't you love him?
[51:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. So good to be in the house of the
[51:20] Lord. And it's so good to have uh Sister
[51:22] Joy Keith here with us, Sister Gloria's
[51:25] mom.
[51:28] And so we appreciate that. I want to say
[51:30] we so enjoyed that time together on uh
[51:33] Friday evening. And uh my it was a good
[51:35] time of good time of fellowship and uh
[51:38] the the finally the fire felt right.
[51:42] Amen. So um but we just thank the Lord
[51:44] for that and we'll try to plan one here
[51:46] for October as well. and um because I
[51:50] think there's some good snacks that we
[51:52] could eat in October. We're getting
[51:53] close to apple picking time. So, it's a
[51:55] it's a good time to excuse to have a an
[51:59] apple crisp, you know. Amen. I want to
[52:02] say it's good to have brother Roco back
[52:03] with us here. Amen.
[52:09] And uh Sister Suzanne, praise the Lord.
[52:11] Sister Suzanne Keenir, how God just
[52:13] moved down for her. Amen.
[52:17] And there and if I forgot somebody else,
[52:19] listen, it's not because you're not
[52:20] important. We've had so many things in
[52:22] and out, but I want to say uh it's so
[52:24] good to be together. And I see different
[52:26] faces, different ones back. I see Sister
[52:28] Ogre, Sister Brun, different ones. And
[52:30] it's so good to be back together. Amen.
[52:33] In the presence of the Lord. But if we
[52:35] could, let's just have uh if the young
[52:37] people would would come at this time, if
[52:39] parents, if you'd like to come as well.
[52:41] And um we just we want to have prayer
[52:45] with them in this time and just
[52:48] certainly ask for God's mercy and ask
[52:52] for God's guidance and his hand upon
[52:55] their lives. Amen.
[52:59] You know, I I look across them with the
[53:01] young people and things and you know,
[53:05] God had there was skilled men that was
[53:08] down in Babylon, young people. The Bible
[53:11] tells us in the opening chapter, many
[53:13] times we read about Daniel and with
[53:15] Daniel in the lion's den and Daniel
[53:17] under the leading of God interpreting,
[53:20] you know, the vision as God would give
[53:21] them. But some of the opening scripture
[53:23] says these young men were skilled
[53:27] &gt;&gt; in science. That's what it says. Math,
[53:31] &gt;&gt; right?
[53:31] &gt;&gt; They were skilled. So, I'm just going to
[53:34] say it like this. God God has all of
[53:37] that in his kingdom. And God entrusts
[53:40] you with what he's placed in your life.
[53:42] And everything you want to do is is
[53:44] Lord, with all of my life, I want to
[53:47] give you glory. I want to I want to
[53:50] bring glory to you, Lord. I want you to
[53:52] have your way in my life. Amen. Let's
[53:55] just let's pray together. Heavenly
[53:58] Father,
[53:59] Lord, how we thank you, dear God, for
[54:01] these young people, Lord, as they are,

[54:15] their journey with you, but the desire
[54:17] is, Lord, that you would not only watch
[54:20] over them, give them wisdom, give them
[54:22] the grace that they need. Lord, I pray
[54:25] that you would just keep your hand upon
[54:28] them. I see as parents standing here

[54:35] other things oh God may you just watch
[54:38] over each one I pray Lord God let it be

[54:44] asking God that Lord that you would give
[54:46] them favor Lord that Father as their
[54:49] lives even being a witness where they go
[54:51] because there's others out there Lord
[54:54] that are longing that are thirsting for
[54:56] life oh God, I pray that Lord, may you
[54:59] just, Lord, make yourself known through
[55:02] their lives, Lord. Lord, give them
[55:04] strength, Lord, and and just, Lord, the
[55:07] understanding that's needed as they go
[55:09] into a class. Give them favor with their
[55:11] professors, with their teachers, Lord,
[55:14] with their peers, oh God. I pray, Lord.
[55:16] And may you just, Lord, keep them, Lord,
[55:18] and in their minds, oh God. May the
[55:21] discernment of the Holy Spirit, Lord,
[55:23] just be there with them, Lord, to
[55:25] discern, Lord, that which is needed,
[55:27] that which to study and take notes on
[55:30] and prepare for a test, Lord. And that
[55:32] you know that will be, Lord, resources
[55:34] they'll draw from later in Lord, in
[55:36] their journey should you tar. We ask God
[55:39] for your protection, your hand of
[55:41] protection Lord upon their lives Lord
[55:44] God day in and day out Lord I pray God
[55:46] and upon these schools and these
[55:48] facilities Lord these places Lord where
[55:51] even they would go Lord we pray God for
[55:53] your mercy Lord. Oh God may their lives
[55:57] just be a real beacon of hope Lord I
[55:59] pray we love you and we thank you Father
[56:02] in Jesus precious name.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless each of you. Hallelujah.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:11] Amen. Let's go ahead and stand.
[56:14] Amen.
[56:23] Want to
[56:27] I want to begin here
[56:30] um in Revelations chapter 1.
[56:34] just a um
[56:37] a real
[56:39] burden. I actually thought I was I was
[56:41] ready to go. And um then I got home on
[56:45] Friday evening and just some things I
[56:47] just couldn't
[56:49] uh just couldn't uh turn loose from. And
[56:52] so I began to write notes before I would
[56:54] go to bed and so I could get up and
[56:56] begin to bring
[56:59] a little bit of a different direction
[57:02] with it.
[57:04] And so let's read here
[57:07] and for in Revelations chapter 1 and
[57:09] verse one, the revelation of Jesus
[57:12] Christ which God gave unto him to show
[57:16] unto his servants things which must
[57:18] shortly come to pass. And he sent and
[57:22] signified it by his angel unto his
[57:25] servant John,
[57:27] who bare record of the word of God, and
[57:30] of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of
[57:33] all things that he saw. Blessed is he
[57:36] that readeth, and they that hear the
[57:38] words of this prophecy, and keep those
[57:41] things which are written therein, for
[57:43] the time is at hand. John to the seven
[57:46] churches which are in Asia. Grace be
[57:50] unto you and peace from him which is and
[57:52] which was and which is to come and from
[57:55] the seven spirits which are before his
[57:57] throne. In verse five, and from Jesus
[58:01] Christ, who is the faithful witness, and
[58:03] the first begotten of the dead, and the
[58:06] prince of the kings of the earth, unto
[58:09] him that loved us, and washed us from
[58:12] our sins in his own blood, and hath made
[58:17] us kings and priests unto God and his
[58:21] father. To him be glory and dominion
[58:23] forever and ever. Amen. Amen. God bless
[58:27] you. As you're being seated, would you
[58:30] um would you turn with me to second
[58:33] Corinthians?
[58:36] Just turn in your Bibles with me to
[58:37] second Corinthians.
[58:48] And in verse verse 14,
[58:54] Paul writes, "Be you not unequally
[58:57] yolked together with unbelievers, for
[59:00] what fellowship hath righteous with
[59:03] unrighteousness?
[59:04] And what communion hath light with
[59:06] darkness?
[59:08] And what concord, or what agreement hath
[59:11] Christ with Belia? Or what part hath he
[59:14] that believeth with an infidel? Verse
[59:18] 16. And what agreement hath the temple
[59:20] of God with idols? For ye are the temple
[59:24] of the living God, as God hath said, I
[59:28] will dwell in them, and walk in them,
[59:31] and I will be their God, and they shall
[59:33] be my people.
[59:35] Wherefore come out from among them, and
[59:39] be you separate, saith the Lord, and
[59:42] touch not the unclean thing, and I will
[59:45] receive you, and will be a father unto
[59:48] you, and you shall be my sons and
[59:52] daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.
[59:56] And I want to just draw just a little
[59:59] further here this morning from that
[1:00:01] thought of being redeemed to serve his
[1:00:06] purpose. And brother Brandham would
[1:00:09] would say it like this in regarding the
[1:00:11] scriptures we read in Revelations
[1:00:14] chapter 1. And he would take that that
[1:00:17] part from where that the declaration is
[1:00:20] is that he hath made us kings and
[1:00:23] priests unto God and in his father. And
[1:00:25] I want to just say this that that in
[1:00:27] everything that God um has done, God
[1:00:32] wants to make that such a reality
[1:00:36] by a revelation in our heart that just
[1:00:38] settles us and brings an authority in
[1:00:41] our life that goes beyond all of our
[1:00:44] reasoning capacity, all of our
[1:00:46] imagination,
[1:00:48] everything to where that should anything
[1:00:51] we become troubled in our spirit, there
[1:00:54] is an author authority on the inside
[1:00:56] that we are living by an anchor that
[1:01:00] holds within the veil wherein that we
[1:01:02] are not able to be moved away but rather
[1:01:05] we have the strength to pull all of
[1:01:08] those other areas into subjection to
[1:01:10] what God has declared and said in our
[1:01:13] lives. And so when we look at this to be
[1:01:16] of a king and notice how that in both of
[1:01:19] these places it would say uh in this
[1:01:23] place that he hath made us kings and
[1:01:25] priests and to see that how that with a
[1:01:29] king itself a king is one who is a ruler
[1:01:33] and the prophet would bring that out
[1:01:35] very clearly to us of what that would
[1:01:37] speak to us that we have been placed
[1:01:40] into a position of authority over sin.
[1:01:44] over the world, over the devil, and over
[1:01:47] the flesh.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; You're not you're not a trotten down
[1:01:51] something. And and this is where we have
[1:01:53] to now we rely on the revelation from
[1:01:56] God that actually holds the real
[1:01:59] identity of who we always were.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; The darkness that was over our life, the
[1:02:06] how things were described, that's not
[1:02:09] who we were. But where we were was that
[1:02:12] seed, that son of God, son or daughter
[1:02:15] of God that was hidden beneath that
[1:02:18] darkness. All it took is for the grace
[1:02:20] of God to come along our pathway and for
[1:02:23] God to lead us into that place to where
[1:02:26] through his blood, there is a
[1:02:28] sanctifying, a cleansing, and then God
[1:02:31] moves in to raise up that part of
[1:02:33] himself as a son and daughter of God.
[1:02:36] And then that son and daughter of God
[1:02:38] begins to reflect that revelation that
[1:02:42] God has placed in their hearts. And then
[1:02:44] that's where that through our lives
[1:02:46] there's a pressing through uh beyond
[1:02:49] sin, beyond the world, all of the
[1:02:52] pressures of beyond that of the flesh. I
[1:02:54] mean, you're sitting here this morning.
[1:02:55] No doubt. Maybe some of you are, some of
[1:02:58] you are not, but some perhaps you had to
[1:03:01] actually put yourself in a place and
[1:03:03] say, "I'm going this morning." Amen.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; You had You're sat here and you've had
[1:03:07] to say, "You know what? Uh, these hands
[1:03:10] don't belong to you, but these hands are
[1:03:12] mine."
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; So, I I need I need I need to borrow. I
[1:03:16] need to use these hands to worship the
[1:03:18] Lord.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, sure. God looks on our heart, but
[1:03:22] you know, it's just like this. How can
[1:03:24] you know when you when you see within
[1:03:26] our heart, how much greater it is when
[1:03:28] God can see what is in your heart being
[1:03:30] actually expressed out through the
[1:03:32] members of our body. What a what a
[1:03:34] glory. You talking about a victory and
[1:03:36] how he just he stands back and he looks
[1:03:39] at that and says, "I know what they're
[1:03:40] going through. I know what they're
[1:03:41] dealing with. I know what opposition. I
[1:03:44] know what they face. And I'm seeing the
[1:03:46] sacrifice." And God's just taking in
[1:03:48] that sacrifice that's being presented
[1:03:51] through our lives. Why? Not because we
[1:03:54] feel like it, but because he's worthy.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; Every moment. He is worthy. Yes.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; And with that, here you are as a king,
[1:04:03] as a ruler, putting your flesh in
[1:04:05] subjection. When thoughts come in your
[1:04:07] mind with situations, as a king, putting
[1:04:10] your your mind in subjection,
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; So, you are a you are a you are a king,
[1:04:17] a ruler. You're let me just say this to
[1:04:19] you. You're not a pusharound.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; You're a ruler.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; And I want to say it in this way. Even
[1:04:28] even as God when God would begin to deal
[1:04:31] with your life, it's not all of a sudden
[1:04:34] as though that you don't have any disc
[1:04:36] uh no I Lord I don't have any authority.
[1:04:38] But you do. When God begins to deal with
[1:04:40] your life, you've got an authority to
[1:04:42] make decisions and say I'm not going to
[1:04:45] stay here no longer.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to stay here no longer.
[1:04:49] That that's the presence of God drawing
[1:04:51] that from our life. And so then this
[1:04:53] other aspect that I want to deal with in
[1:04:56] here this morning is that of a priest
[1:04:58] and how that within the priest the
[1:05:00] prophet said he has made us priest and
[1:05:03] priest unto him offering the spiritual
[1:05:06] praise of sanctified lips spending our
[1:05:11] lives as a sweet offering unto him
[1:05:13] worshiping him in spirit and in truth
[1:05:17] interceding and petitioning priests and
[1:05:20] kings unto our God. No wonder the world
[1:05:23] does not appeal to us. We are a peculiar
[1:05:26] people. Uh maybe odd and strange acting
[1:05:29] to the world, but this word peculiar
[1:05:31] means we we uh we are under ownership.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; The seal of God has come upon our life.
[1:05:39] And you know what? I'm not a prisoner as
[1:05:41] far as oh, I'm in prison. No, I'm a
[1:05:43] prisoner of love.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; And this is not I I'm free. You're free.
[1:05:48] You're free. You can do whatever you
[1:05:49] want. It's just the change of the desire
[1:05:52] on the inside has come upon your life. I
[1:05:56] don't want to do anything that's of the
[1:05:59] world or against the word. So it's
[1:06:01] you're not being held under a law.
[1:06:03] You're walking by grace.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; That's so good.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; So we are peculiar people that's zealous
[1:06:11] unto good works. When God makes
[1:06:13] something known, when God reveals
[1:06:14] something, we want to move. We want to
[1:06:16] act upon it because our desire is we
[1:06:18] want to please him. We have been
[1:06:21] recreated in him to be children like
[1:06:25] unto our father.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; Recreated,
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; not something made and made over. We've
[1:06:31] been re recreated. There's a new
[1:06:34] creation on the inside
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; by God himself coming down and becoming
[1:06:40] one of us.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; The blood being shed and the life coming
[1:06:44] to our lives. And I want to just kind of
[1:06:46] just work with that here a little bit
[1:06:48] here this morning because you understand
[1:06:51] that everything that you face and you
[1:06:54] deal with in life, even when you come
[1:06:57] through oppositions, when you come
[1:06:59] through heartaches, when you come
[1:07:01] through situations, there is a ground
[1:07:04] that you must not leave. It's a ground
[1:07:07] you must bring every thought to. It's a
[1:07:09] ground you must bring every uh uh every
[1:07:12] situation and come back on. come back
[1:07:14] into those grounds. And the grounds I'm
[1:07:16] talking about is the sacred sands of
[1:07:19] God's grace.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; What God has done in your life, how he
[1:07:23] has revealed himself to you. Don't don't
[1:07:26] get trapped by trying to get out in your
[1:07:28] reasoning. Bring make sure the enemy,
[1:07:31] he's can't step foot on those sacred
[1:07:33] sands. Are you hearing me? He can't step
[1:07:35] foot there. But if you will bring every
[1:07:37] situation there, God is the one that
[1:07:40] will uncover and unfold, even the
[1:07:43] snares, even the traps, even everything
[1:07:46] that the enemy has sought. Every weapon
[1:07:49] that he has sought to try to use against
[1:07:52] you.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; In the presence of God, in the shikina
[1:07:55] light, it unravels.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; Untangles all those things. Praise the
[1:08:00] Lord.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; Sometimes that comes where you're taking
[1:08:03] in prayer,
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; waiting on God,
[1:08:07] not moving and acting hastily,
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; not making rash judgments, not drawing
[1:08:13] conclusions without coming into his
[1:08:15] presence.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; Right? That's being a king and a priest
[1:08:20] and ruler within the temple. I'm not
[1:08:23] going to let anything reside in this
[1:08:24] temple
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; that's unlike him.
[1:08:27] Now I want to come into this place here
[1:08:30] for what he's done for us because God
[1:08:33] would tell to would tell Israel in
[1:08:36] Deuteronomy to remember where God
[1:08:39] brought you from.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; It's it's very important you you never
[1:08:43] let me tell you friends you never get
[1:08:45] beyond that memory. You realize where
[1:08:48] God has brought you from. And it's not
[1:08:50] just where he took you out of the world
[1:08:51] and he filled you with the Holy Spirit,
[1:08:53] but even after he's filled you with the
[1:08:55] Holy Spirit, how he's brought you a
[1:08:57] mighty long way.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; Must never remember. And sometimes you
[1:09:01] you know you can look back and consider
[1:09:03] and say my where he's brought me from.
[1:09:05] And it's truly you are saying it's him
[1:09:08] that has brought me to where I'm at. He
[1:09:10] didn't pull me. He didn't push me. But
[1:09:12] his grace came and melted my will to
[1:09:16] surrender more to him. and it's him
[1:09:18] that's brought me here. And so when
[1:09:19] you're standing there, all the glory is
[1:09:22] going to him.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; That's so good.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Now, God is a leader.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; God doesn't entrust things and just ask
[1:09:33] you and I to do something that he
[1:09:36] wouldn't do himself.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:38] God himself is the one when he uh makes
[1:09:43] requirements and in in his word.
[1:09:45] Remember when he God came, he took his
[1:09:49] own laws, his own word upon himself.
[1:09:53] God did that because he is the word.
[1:09:56] Every law that he gave, there was not
[1:09:57] one law escape but he himself, he came
[1:10:00] down. He is the lawgiver. Remember the
[1:10:02] spirit of God is the same. It's the same
[1:10:06] spirit of God that wrote with a finger
[1:10:08] the ten commandments and men man could
[1:10:12] not his nature was not aligned with what
[1:10:15] was wrote there. But God said I will
[1:10:19] make a new covenant. And that new
[1:10:22] covenant that God would make would come
[1:10:25] through and by the atonement. It would
[1:10:27] require the atonement. It would require
[1:10:29] an innocent one because you and I were
[1:10:32] standing guilty. We were helpless.
[1:10:34] There's no way that we can get to God.
[1:10:37] But God came down and became one of us.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; That's why Paul said he is our peace.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; Peace, yes, is an attribute, but it's a
[1:10:49] real expression of who he is. That he
[1:10:52] has brought and ministered peace to you
[1:10:54] and I. He is one that claims peace over
[1:10:58] our life. that you don't have to war and
[1:11:01] struggle and fight and wrestle against
[1:11:03] sin. He is our peace. He's the satisfier
[1:11:07] of the need. He's the satisfier of that
[1:11:10] situation. He is our peace.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, sure. When he comes to proclaim
[1:11:18] peace, it stirs up war.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; That's good. Because every time when the
[1:11:22] gospel trumpet sounds, every message
[1:11:26] that God ever dropped,
[1:11:28] every all the way through the ages,
[1:11:30] every one of those ages when a gospel
[1:11:32] trumpet sounded, it it it was noting war
[1:11:36] was on. And what was the war? The war
[1:11:38] was against the kingdom of Satan.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; You understand? It's God. You and I,
[1:11:47] even down through those ages, they
[1:11:50] didn't know where to turn to. But God
[1:11:52] knew who his children were in every age.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet could stand there
[1:11:57] in the message the rapture and say, "You
[1:11:59] hear these men making statements about
[1:12:01] the promise of the hour, the message of
[1:12:03] the hour." He said, "What that is is God
[1:12:06] has made a promise in his word
[1:12:08] concerning this day." And he goes on to
[1:12:10] say, "We wouldn't even know where to
[1:12:13] look if not for the Holy Spirit that has
[1:12:16] guided us to these principles." You see,
[1:12:18] it's the Holy Spirit that has even
[1:12:21] guided you here this morning. It's the
[1:12:23] Holy Spirit. Listen, friends, you didn't
[1:12:25] come in contact with this message by
[1:12:27] chance. And it wasn't you coming in
[1:12:29] contact with the message. It was the
[1:12:31] message coming in contact with your
[1:12:34] life.
[1:12:37] And the message is not an idea.
[1:12:41] The message is the revealing of the
[1:12:44] person of Jesus Christ.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; That's why that opening text, the
[1:12:49] revelation of Jesus Christ, it's not
[1:12:52] lost through those seven stars. But
[1:12:55] those seven stars are shining in the
[1:12:58] darkness of night. They have no light of
[1:13:01] their own, but they are in his right
[1:13:03] hand of authority and power. And it is
[1:13:06] God that is illuminating the pathway for
[1:13:10] you and I to come back into fellowship
[1:13:13] with God. Amen.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; So the seven stars never take away from
[1:13:20] his glory. But the true seven stars are
[1:13:24] there to reveal, reflect the light from
[1:13:28] the ho from the holiest of holies.
[1:13:31] Reflected onto the labor, a place where
[1:13:34] there's cleansing. Reflect it back to
[1:13:36] Calvary to show there is a way. And this
[1:13:40] is that way to get back into fellowship.
[1:13:42] It's a way that's calling us, get back
[1:13:45] under the blood.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; God
[1:13:52] would not ask you and I to do something
[1:13:54] the prophet says it over and over that
[1:13:56] he himself
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; was unwilling to do.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; I want you to hold that thought here
[1:14:02] this morning. It's key.
[1:14:05] God as he asked us and through Paul,
[1:14:09] Paul announcing this to the Corinthian
[1:14:12] church in that hour and to all believers
[1:14:15] down through time of calling them to the
[1:14:18] place that their their vessels, their
[1:14:22] lives are not to be given to to idolatry
[1:14:26] or or fellowship with darkness, but how
[1:14:29] God begins to deal with our lives and
[1:14:32] where you know there's sometimes listen
[1:14:34] friends where there's associations that
[1:14:36] need to be cut off.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; Let me just tell you something about the
[1:14:40] workplace. There was good people I
[1:14:42] worked with, but it got to a spot that
[1:14:45] I'll tell you right now. I stopped going
[1:14:47] in that break room.
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; You know why? Cuz I kept cuz I got tired
[1:14:51] of feeling dirty.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; Because of the insinuations that would
[1:14:56] be made.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; All the cracks and that that's their
[1:14:59] normal language. I'm not I'm not I'm not
[1:15:01] downing them. That's their normal
[1:15:03] language.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; That's normal for them. Just like I'd
[1:15:07] put butter on my bread. But it's up to
[1:15:09] me that I can continue to go before God
[1:15:13] and say, "Lord, cleanse me, Lord. Oh, I
[1:15:15] just feel so terrible." Or as a son and
[1:15:18] daughter, begin to realize, "Wait a
[1:15:19] minute here. I can avoid that whole
[1:15:22] thing alto together."
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; You say, "What is that?" That's being a
[1:15:27] king.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; It's being a king.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; So good. Because you know why? You you
[1:15:33] exert that as a king because you're a
[1:15:35] priest
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; and you're meant to give spiritual
[1:15:38] sacrifice to God. And as a king, you are
[1:15:40] meant to hold it like Nehemiah that
[1:15:43] nothing encroaches upon worship for that
[1:15:47] is what you were created for.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So that's there's a
[1:15:52] discernment. God, give me the
[1:15:53] discernment that I need
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; in these times. Give me the discernment,
[1:15:57] Lord, that we need. So God speaking to
[1:16:00] them that you know that what what what
[1:16:03] agreement at the temple of God and he's
[1:16:05] calling them out come out be you
[1:16:08] separate from the unclean thing I will
[1:16:10] be your father uh you shall be my sons
[1:16:13] and daughters saith the Lord Almighty
[1:16:18] now God as I said he's a leader
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; and let me just say this with redemption
[1:16:24] he showed it all the way down through
[1:16:26] the scriptures Right?
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; He wanted to show that
[1:16:31] it was in bits and pieces all the way
[1:16:34] down. It was Christ all the way through.
[1:16:37] It was a scarlet cord all the way
[1:16:39] through.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; And so God himself,
[1:16:43] he comes down and becomes one of us.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; I want to just say, let me just read
[1:16:50] this this scripture here and trusting
[1:16:52] all this, it'll come together. I got a
[1:16:54] few more places that I want to read from
[1:16:56] here, but notice in in Titus 2 11, for
[1:17:00] the grace of God that bringeth salvation
[1:17:04] hath appeared to all men, teaching us
[1:17:06] that denying ungodliness and worldly
[1:17:09] lust, we should live soberly,
[1:17:12] righteously, godly in this present
[1:17:14] world, looking for that blessed hope and
[1:17:17] the glorious appearing of the great God
[1:17:20] in our Savior Jesus Christ, who gave
[1:17:23] himself down for us. Now, I want you to
[1:17:24] notice this. When Paul's writing this,
[1:17:27] he's not putting them as though this is
[1:17:29] two separate people. These are two
[1:17:31] separate personalities. A great God and
[1:17:34] our savior Jesus Christ and is a
[1:17:36] conjunction. Jesus Christ, our savior,
[1:17:39] is the flesh is the embodiment of God
[1:17:42] becoming our savior, our redeemer. Amen.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; When the fall took place in Eden, he
[1:17:53] never sent another.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; He came himself.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; There were others who said, "I'll take
[1:18:01] the T." Nope.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; I've had an appointment with them
[1:18:05] evening after evening, and I'm going
[1:18:08] down. But father,
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; there is a fall that has taken place,
[1:18:13] but they are still my children. No
[1:18:16] matter if they're in a fallen condition,
[1:18:19] I'm going down.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; Nothing could keep him back from his
[1:18:26] children. Why? Cuz his children are a
[1:18:28] part of him.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; Nothing could stop that.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; I tell you as a parent, you ought to put
[1:18:40] that on your fifth ribbon and say, "I
[1:18:42] claim them right now, Lord.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; Wherever they're at, I claim them.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; I claim them, Lord."
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; But, you don't know where they're at.
[1:18:49] They're not off limits for the presence
[1:18:50] of God.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; The prophet tells us the angel of the
[1:18:54] Lord went to the pig pin and dealt with
[1:18:58] the heart of that prodal son.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Sam, you're making some
[1:19:06] wine. No, I'm not making wide out
[1:19:08] claims. I'm claiming what belongs to me.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm claiming each one. I'm
[1:19:16] claiming those that have bachelin. I'm
[1:19:18] claiming those. I'm holding on because
[1:19:21] why? God is rich in mercy.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God never came down to run
[1:19:29] his children down. He came down to not
[1:19:32] only investigate. He wasn't snooping
[1:19:34] around. He came down
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; because there was a need
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; and that need demanded the coming of the
[1:19:42] Lord
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; in your life in my life. The need in our
[1:19:48] life demanded the need demanded the
[1:19:52] coming of the Lord in our life.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; We needed more than a church.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; We needed more than a knowledge. We
[1:19:59] needed more than good principles. We
[1:20:02] needed the coming of the Lord in our
[1:20:04] lives.
[1:20:06] [Applause]
[1:20:07] [Music]
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; And God didn't short change it. He
[1:20:11] didn't send somebody else.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; He came himself.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; He became one of us.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Samuel, let me just
[1:20:25] say it." What's very important because
[1:20:28] when you recognize that the Holy Ghost
[1:20:31] in your life in my life is nothing less
[1:20:34] than God himself moving into another
[1:20:38] form
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; but the very life of the sacrifice now
[1:20:42] tabernacling and flowing and a creative
[1:20:45] work in our life to do the same works
[1:20:49] that Jesus did. What are those same
[1:20:50] works? A life that's lived by the word.
[1:20:53] Amen.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; A life that is now come in contact with
[1:20:58] God
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; by the spirit of God. And when God
[1:21:02] listen when you have come in contact
[1:21:04] with God, you now have become a
[1:21:07] candidate.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; These are the words of the prophet of
[1:21:10] association with an unseen realm in the
[1:21:14] supernatural. Amen.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; Hey, if there's people on earth, which
[1:21:18] they are, being motivated by the
[1:21:20] supernatural, and they're being drawn to
[1:21:23] give themselves to images, and this
[1:21:25] earth is being filled with violence
[1:21:28] through them, then God's got to have
[1:21:30] some people like Noah whose hearts are
[1:21:33] given to God, and God is projecting and
[1:21:37] revealing the right vision of his word.
[1:21:39] And that vision of his word is that he
[1:21:42] would be preeminent the first place the
[1:21:45] Lord in your life. And there is a vision
[1:21:48] you're walking by.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; We're not walking wondering.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; But it is God revealing.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; It's waiting on God,
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; Lord, for the next step. While I'm in
[1:22:02] this step, Lord, let me let me if this
[1:22:04] is where I'm at right now, let let me
[1:22:05] let me let me draw from you everything
[1:22:09] and loosen myself from everything
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; that's unlike you so that there more of
[1:22:16] God might come.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; So this how God would make himself known
[1:22:24] to us in this time. This is why brother
[1:22:27] Brandham would take this of how God
[1:22:30] becoming one of us and his love that
[1:22:33] he's had for us and he says now I want
[1:22:36] you to think you are sons and daughters
[1:22:38] of God. This is out of the kinsman
[1:22:40] redeemer messages. You are sons and
[1:22:43] daughters of God. And he says regarding
[1:22:47] and he says who has received the Holy
[1:22:49] Ghost. He said, "Now, if you're an orpha
[1:22:51] bunch and you've turned away, but you
[1:22:53] know, if you've went on through to the
[1:22:54] Holy Spirit, you become sons and
[1:22:57] daughters of God." And he says, "Now,
[1:23:00] sons and daughters, who has the most
[1:23:03] power before God?" What is it? Is it an
[1:23:06] angel? An angel's a servant. They're his
[1:23:08] servants. What are you, his son and
[1:23:11] daughter? Who has the most power in
[1:23:13] heaven? A sinner that's been saved by
[1:23:15] grace or an archangel that's standing by
[1:23:18] his right side. The sinner the sinner
[1:23:21] that's been saved by grace has more
[1:23:24] authority in heaven than the archangel
[1:23:27] that stood by his side without sin cuz
[1:23:31] he's a son and a son has more authority
[1:23:35] than a servant of course.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. This next part, oh my. Oh, we
[1:23:43] forget what we are. We forget many times
[1:23:47] what made us what we are. After we
[1:23:50] become what we are, then we forgot how
[1:23:53] we got here.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; Oh God, I say God, send a fresh
[1:23:59] remembrance, Lord,
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; over this congregation into every one of
[1:24:03] our hearts. Lord, you say, why? when we
[1:24:06] can remember that and just consider that
[1:24:08] it was the supernatural. It was God who
[1:24:11] came. It was God who moved across our
[1:24:13] life. And so now now look at your
[1:24:16] situations. Look at what you're asking
[1:24:18] God for. Look at your prayer request.
[1:24:20] And when you look at your prayer
[1:24:22] request, you'll not be looking at it
[1:24:24] through the eyes of your reasoning,
[1:24:25] through the eyes of imagination, through
[1:24:28] the eyes of conscience, but you're
[1:24:30] looking at it through the eyes of the
[1:24:32] supernatural God by a faith that looks
[1:24:36] to the unseen and close those things
[1:24:39] that are not as though they are.
[1:24:54] Now there was there was sacrifices
[1:24:58] that were made. God gave those
[1:25:00] sacrifices.
[1:25:02] In Hebrews chapter 10, it speaks of how
[1:25:05] the law having a good having a shadow of
[1:25:07] good things to come. not the very image
[1:25:10] of the things can never with those
[1:25:12] sacrifices which they offered year by
[1:25:14] year continually make the comers there
[1:25:16] into perfect. For then would they not
[1:25:18] have ceased to be offered. In other
[1:25:20] words, if they met what was due, those
[1:25:23] sacrifices, well, that would have been
[1:25:25] perfect. But they weren't perfect. But
[1:25:27] you say, well, why did God give them?
[1:25:29] God gave them because of his desire to
[1:25:33] have fellowship.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:25:35] And through those things, through every
[1:25:38] one of those examples of the bulock of
[1:25:41] the turtle duck, all of those, God made
[1:25:43] gave an example of his desire and his
[1:25:46] longing for fellowship. You know, God
[1:25:48] would even make it so clear. If you
[1:25:50] can't afford this, if you can't afford
[1:25:52] this, then this is what you can bring.
[1:25:55] You know why? Because God said, I'm not
[1:25:57] going to let anything of what you're
[1:25:59] able to provide stand between us and
[1:26:02] fellowship. Amen.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; So, it had really had nothing to do with
[1:26:07] how much means we had. It's how willing
[1:26:10] we were to surrender what we did have.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Woo! Glory be to God.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; You say, "What is that?" That's God.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; That's God.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; I'm gonna get to that in a minute.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; That's God.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; It's God leading us out. It's God
[1:26:32] through through through through types
[1:26:34] and and shadows. It's God relaying. It's
[1:26:37] God saying to you and I that I love you.
[1:26:39] You're my son. You're my daughter. Don't
[1:26:42] let anything stand between us.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, there's no reason for
[1:26:47] you to let anything stand between you
[1:26:50] and God. Well, I've failed and I've went
[1:26:52] astray. I failed God this many times.
[1:26:54] Don't let that stand there. Satan's
[1:26:56] trying to make that roadblock into a
[1:26:58] mountain. But I say, who art thou, oh
[1:27:01] great mountain
[1:27:05] before Zerubabel,
[1:27:07] whose hands have laid the foundation?
[1:27:10] And welcome back the chief cornerstone.
[1:27:12] Who are you?
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? As sons and
[1:27:17] daughters of God that have a firm
[1:27:18] foundation, sealed with the spirit of
[1:27:21] God, you're standing as sons and
[1:27:23] daughters of God to speak to the
[1:27:25] opposition of darkness.
[1:27:28] Who are you?
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; Not what. Not what. Not what. Who?
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; Paul never said, "What shall say?" He
[1:27:36] said, "Who shall separate us?"
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; Spirits that want to get in there. It's
[1:27:41] a spiritual warfare.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is where we come as
[1:27:45] kings.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Let me
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. As kings, we've been seated.
[1:27:58] We're riding in authority. The Holy
[1:28:01] Spirit has lifted us. We're we're we're
[1:28:04] riding under the in the authority of the
[1:28:06] Holy Spirit. And yet, as a priest in our
[1:28:09] lives, we are walking,
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; holy cha holy, holy unto the Lord.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. Who did this? He did
[1:28:19] it.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; Let's remember how we got here.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:26] Notice with all this when God came down
[1:28:28] he he took the innocent one in Genesis
[1:28:31] he threw in the clothing the garments so
[1:28:34] they could come and stand in his
[1:28:36] presence. God would would make this
[1:28:37] known of the shedding of the blood of an
[1:28:40] innocent one all the way through the
[1:28:42] scriptures. Job Job offered up a burnt
[1:28:44] offering every morning he did this per
[1:28:47] adventure. My children they have gone
[1:28:49] astray. They have they have sinned.
[1:28:51] Maybe they're, you know, whatever I
[1:28:53] what's maybe something that's come in
[1:28:55] their life. But he offered up the burnt
[1:28:56] offering continually. You know why? He
[1:28:58] had confidence
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; in God. God made a way that Job could
[1:29:04] approach him through. And Job could
[1:29:06] stand there on that burnt offering and
[1:29:08] know this is what God has revealed to
[1:29:11] me. And I'm standing here upon this
[1:29:14] burnt offering. Job was tied by
[1:29:17] revelation to God.
[1:29:20] [Applause]
[1:29:24] You think daily the enemy didn't try to
[1:29:26] pound to Job and say you're just going
[1:29:28] through the act. Job said it might feel
[1:29:30] like that, but there is an action of
[1:29:32] faith that's coming from my soul.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; And that king on the inside is said, I
[1:29:38] need to borrow the hands for the priest
[1:29:40] within me.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; I need to borrow your lips so I can tell
[1:29:47] him how much I love him.
[1:29:52] Excuse me. I need to borrow your feet so
[1:29:54] I can dance how I feel in my soul.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; Kings and priests.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. For them would they not have
[1:30:09] ceased to been offered but in those
[1:30:11] sacrifices
[1:30:12] because the worshipper would have
[1:30:13] remembrance conscience. The desire would
[1:30:15] still be there. He would go in and offer
[1:30:17] it up. But he left with the same desire.
[1:30:20] But he was able to have fellowship. He
[1:30:21] had made confession. He had laid his
[1:30:24] hands upon that sacrifice. Listen
[1:30:26] friends, you've got to fully become
[1:30:29] identified with the word. You've got to
[1:30:31] apply the blood. Listen, if you want the
[1:30:34] spirit to come, you must apply the
[1:30:37] blood.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; And when you apply the blood by faith,
[1:30:41] then the spirit will come to as a
[1:30:44] witness. The blood has been applied. You
[1:30:46] say, "What do you mean?" Take the word
[1:30:48] into your life.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; Apply it to your life.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; There's things you know that's not
[1:30:58] right.
[1:30:59] Ask God to cleanse you.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; Lord, take that desire away.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; And lay it down, Lord, in the name of
[1:31:06] Jesus Christ.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; Say, "Brother Samuel, I've laid it down
[1:31:11] a number of times, but lay it down. Quit
[1:31:14] taking it back up. and lay it down in
[1:31:16] the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; That personal revelation though, God
[1:31:25] gave him a revelation
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; of this type. And listen, there was some
[1:31:31] who went through the motions. Yeah.
[1:31:34] Remember you you can read in in Isaiah.
[1:31:36] Isaiah said, "Your feast and your
[1:31:38] sacrifices have become a stink in my
[1:31:40] nostril."
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; Right? Even Saul got caught up with, "We
[1:31:44] got to have a sacrifice. We got to have
[1:31:46] a sacrifice." Man, what? Where's Samuel
[1:31:50] at? Where's Samuel at? Oh, he's running
[1:31:54] so late. Where's he at?
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; He was so focused
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; on the sacrifice that he failed to see
[1:32:02] what was greater, obedience.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; That is so good.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; And this is where that man got to. They
[1:32:09] begin to offer sacrifices without
[1:32:12] sincerity.
[1:32:14] That's why God just doesn't want our
[1:32:16] form. He doesn't want a ritual. Remember
[1:32:18] the Bible said in this day it would be
[1:32:21] forms of godliness but in the know then
[1:32:24] lacking the power, lacking the strength,
[1:32:27] lacking the Holy Ghost, lacking the
[1:32:29] seal, but have a form.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, we don't want to be conformed. We
[1:32:33] don't want a form. We want the living
[1:32:35] reality.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; We want Christ. dwelling in our lives.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; And those it was revealed to when
[1:32:44] Abraham offered, when Job offered, when
[1:32:47] all of those elect down through the
[1:32:50] ages, you say elect. The prophet takes
[1:32:53] us to the scriptures.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; When Jesus rose, the Bible said, "And
[1:32:59] the graves were open and many."
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "Notice, not all,
[1:33:04] many." Yeah,
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; it was that elect that laid down there
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; when they offered that lamb. Let me tell
[1:33:10] you something. They were looking for the
[1:33:11] coming of the Lord
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; because that revelation told them.
[1:33:16] That's why Job all the way through the
[1:33:18] book of Job. Job himself, you can't get
[1:33:21] him to relinguish
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; the perfectness of his sacrifice and
[1:33:26] what the sacrifice has done for him.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; You You can't tell. You know what? You
[1:33:30] can't separate Job from his sacrifice.
[1:33:32] It'd be easier to stop the sun.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; That's the power of divine revelation.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; You have become a part by revelation.
[1:33:43] It's the spirit of God coming into your
[1:33:46] life and you become one. You become
[1:33:48] merged. It's united together.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; So what you're speaking is not something
[1:33:53] different than who you are.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; They were looking for it by revelation.
[1:34:02] That's why when he went down to the
[1:34:04] lowest parts of hell with your sins and
[1:34:07] my sins, Ezekiel looking out the window
[1:34:10] said, "That's him. The wheel in the
[1:34:12] middle of the wheel." Abraham said,
[1:34:14] "Sarah, Sarah, I I I know. I know
[1:34:15] Abraham. I'm looking over your shoulder.
[1:34:18] That's the one that came to our 10
[1:34:19] door." Yeah. Yeah. And not only did he
[1:34:21] come to our 10 door, remember I told you
[1:34:22] he met me on the plains after the battle
[1:34:25] was over.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; Daniel said, "Hey, hey, wait, wait."
[1:34:30] Yep. That's him. That's the one who came
[1:34:31] in the lion's den. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep.
[1:34:33] Yep. Yep.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; You see, they were offering the lamb
[1:34:38] with an expectation.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, that's what revelation
[1:34:43] does to your life. It transforms you
[1:34:46] from dead carnal works.
[1:34:49] The blood of Jesus Christ has purchased,
[1:34:52] opened up for you and I a new living way
[1:34:56] into the holiest of holies to purge us
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; from dead works.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; To a to a life to this there's an
[1:35:03] expectation.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; I'm looking for him.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; I'm looking for him to come on this need
[1:35:09] that I'm praying about. I'm looking for
[1:35:11] him to come in our church. I'm looking
[1:35:13] for him to come in my home. I'm living
[1:35:15] for the coming of the Lord.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. I'm expecting God.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; I'm expecting him to fulfill his needs.
[1:35:23] I don't care what the devil wants to
[1:35:24] whisper in your mind and say, "Oh, you
[1:35:26] know that that's a little way out there
[1:35:28] and you've been praying about that a
[1:35:29] long time." It matters not how long
[1:35:32] you've been praying about it.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; Don't ever stop praying about your loved
[1:35:38] ones.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; Don't ever do that.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; You keep holding on. You keep calling
[1:35:46] out to God.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; Different ones that we see even right
[1:35:50] here maybe around the church or backslid
[1:35:53] don't keep don't stop from calling out.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; Be as a priest intercede for them.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; They might be under some of the greatest
[1:36:02] bitterness and the enemy may have tried
[1:36:05] to sour them and and tried to come
[1:36:07] against them. But I'll tell you what
[1:36:08] will defeat that is you entering in in
[1:36:11] prayer and your life, my life becoming
[1:36:13] more sweetened with the rose of Sharon,
[1:36:16] the dew of Herman, the lily of the
[1:36:19] valley, the shakina of glory.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; Amen,
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; brother Samuel. They just need a
[1:36:26] lecture. They don't need a lecture.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; You got to stop thinking in earthly
[1:36:31] terms. You'll only get earthly results.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; Pray. Pray and pray and pray. When I
[1:36:40] don't see him here, keep praying.
[1:36:42] [Music]
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So this revelation he taketh
[1:36:52] away my my lord. My lord. Notice this.
[1:36:55] It said, "But in those sacrifices
[1:36:57] there's remembrance again made of sins
[1:37:00] every year. For it's not possible that
[1:37:02] the blood of bulls and goats should take
[1:37:04] away sins. Wherefore when he cometh into
[1:37:06] the world, he said, "A sacrifice and
[1:37:08] offering thou wouldest not, but a body
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; hast thou prepared me."
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; God prepared his own temple.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; His dwelling place,
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; God,
[1:37:23] as the prophet could say, let me just
[1:37:25] read you a few statements.
[1:37:28] He says regarding the word becoming, he
[1:37:32] says the word was made human being
[1:37:35] became our kinsman. He became what I was
[1:37:40] so that I might through his grace become
[1:37:41] what he is.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; God became man. He became kin folks. And
[1:37:46] he couldn't be God and us sinners. So we
[1:37:48] were separated him, God, us sinners,
[1:37:51] creations of his creation, created
[1:37:53] beings of his creation because we
[1:37:55] couldn't be kin folks there. If God just
[1:37:57] remaining there within that form, God
[1:38:01] and here, you and I sinners, but
[1:38:04] somebody had to span the breach
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; and you and I couldn't get here.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; But God himself came down to where we
[1:38:14] were.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; He was made, the Bible said, in the
[1:38:19] likeness of sinful flesh.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; You want to know what God thinks about
[1:38:23] you? He was willing to come and be made
[1:38:26] like you
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; and me.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; Want to know if he loves you? Well, I
[1:38:31] don't know if God loves you. God came
[1:38:34] all the way down and took on a body of
[1:38:36] humiliation.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; And he didn't stop there. He went to
[1:38:43] Calvary. And in the middle, in the midst
[1:38:46] of this time of spanning the breach, he
[1:38:49] manifested the victory through the
[1:38:53] temple that God had created.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; Stay with me now.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; He was manifesting
[1:39:00] the purpose that God intended for man to
[1:39:04] walk in.
[1:39:06] What had been examples and types and
[1:39:09] shadows now the antitype is standing
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; here as Jesus could stand in the temple
[1:39:15] and say if you could know it when they
[1:39:19] were debating about oh you've healed one
[1:39:20] on the Sabbath day oh the gold on the
[1:39:23] altar all the and Jesus said you've got
[1:39:25] it all wrong
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; you've got it all wrong what did he say
[1:39:28] what was it that was clouding their
[1:39:30] judgment
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; they left out mercy Yes,
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; that's good.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; How many know that as a Bible reader?
[1:39:38] Jesus pointed out, he said,
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; "You've forsaken the most omitted in one
[1:39:42] place." He says, "The most important me
[1:39:44] matter me measures love and mercy,
[1:39:47] right?
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; On which all the law and the prophets
[1:39:50] hang." Because listen, if everything
[1:39:52] that was wrote here, if there wasn't
[1:39:54] mercy and grace, which there was, God
[1:39:57] expressed his mercy to Israel down
[1:39:59] through the time and then when God came,
[1:40:02] he was full of mercy. This was God's
[1:40:05] expression of mercy.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; Are y'all right? We're just going to go
[1:40:10] ahead and preach.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; When Israel had failed and then and and
[1:40:14] the and and the golden calf and then
[1:40:17] there came a cleansing. Remember who's
[1:40:19] on the Lord's side? come stand by me.
[1:40:20] And there they came. Every one of them
[1:40:22] came over there and they stood by on the
[1:40:25] side of the of the word that was
[1:40:26] vindicated. God opened up the earth and
[1:40:28] he swallowed that of the earth. Now
[1:40:30] listen, he didn't swallow up every bit
[1:40:32] of Chorus household cuz there were still
[1:40:34] some of his boys left over in the book
[1:40:35] of Psalms. And let me tell let me just
[1:40:37] preach a little bit on that and then
[1:40:38] I'll get back over here. When you look
[1:40:40] at that, when it said how that these
[1:40:41] boys would write some songs, let me tell
[1:40:43] you something. And when you read that
[1:40:44] song that says it's the from the sons of
[1:40:46] Kora, I want to tell you that those
[1:40:49] young men, they had to battle through
[1:40:51] every accusation where the devil would
[1:40:53] say, "You're just like your daddy.
[1:40:55] You're just like this." But they
[1:40:57] themselves had a revelation that pierced
[1:41:00] beyond their family genealogy.
[1:41:05] Let me tell you what it was. It was God
[1:41:07] who laid hold on their life. All they
[1:41:10] could say is what God said.
[1:41:13] And it brought out a new song.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; Thou art worthy.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; Thou art worthy. I'm not the son of
[1:41:21] Kora. I'm not the son of this. I'm a son
[1:41:23] of God.
[1:41:25] Lord,
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; there was a song sealed in their lives
[1:41:31] [Music]
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; that no matter of muck and gum and
[1:41:34] everything else through the family tree
[1:41:36] could silence that voice
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; that was meant to be sounded through
[1:41:42] their lives
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; as a testimony. No matter what your
[1:41:45] background is, God is greater than your
[1:41:47] background.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; Cuz your background, your real
[1:41:50] background goes farther than your
[1:41:52] background.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; Chew on that one. We'll talk later. It
[1:41:56] go I'm talking it goes back before time.
[1:41:58] I'm talking back in the mind of God.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; That's where you and I came from.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; And so in order to redeem you and I, God
[1:42:08] himself stepped from glory and became
[1:42:11] one of us.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; That's why when God made made himself
[1:42:18] known to Abraham, consider this. Then
[1:42:22] here was Melzdc, king
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; of Salem and priest of the most high
[1:42:28] God.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; See, he who was king and priest would
[1:42:33] become one of us
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; to release and make us kings and
[1:42:37] priests.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; That's why the really with that of
[1:42:40] Melzdc is not so much a priesthood, a
[1:42:43] new order, yet it is a priesthood, but
[1:42:45] it's actually life, eternal life. We
[1:42:49] have been brought into the person of
[1:42:52] eternal life by one spirit. Everybody
[1:42:54] with me?
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; We are baptized into one body.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; We have been brought in here. He sought
[1:43:00] you and I out.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; We didn't know our names was in the
[1:43:04] ledger.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; We didn't know our names was in this.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; We didn't even know even when it came to
[1:43:11] message of the hour. We didn't even know
[1:43:12] that. We didn't even know about that.
[1:43:14] You might have sat here for years
[1:43:16] message of the hour. maybe repeated it
[1:43:18] and God finally he breaks the seals off
[1:43:21] of your life cuz he's already broken the
[1:43:23] seals off the book and he takes the
[1:43:27] seals off of your life. How does he do
[1:43:29] that? By anointing your eyes with the
[1:43:32] eyes of the Holy Spirit
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; to look beyond yourself,
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; beyond what you see in the mirror every
[1:43:41] morning and to look with eyes of faith.
[1:43:44] I believe what God said.
[1:43:48] The Bible said, "Let the redeemed of the
[1:43:51] Lord say so."
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; They that he hath redeemed from the hand
[1:43:58] of the enemy.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; I am his son.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; I am his daughter.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; He has redeemed me.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He has brought me back to
[1:44:11] himself.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:15] That's why when the Holy Spirit through
[1:44:17] the word of the hour begins to lay claim
[1:44:18] on your on your life, you can never be
[1:44:20] satisfied until it's a full surrender
[1:44:23] and God has filled you fully. You know
[1:44:25] why? That's God's desire. That's
[1:44:27] redemption claims. If there's something
[1:44:29] that belongs to you, you're you're
[1:44:31] willing to fight for it. You'll stand
[1:44:33] right there and God himself is standing
[1:44:35] faithfully right there and saying,
[1:44:37] "You're mine.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; You might have gone away, but he says
[1:44:40] you're mine.
[1:44:42] You get back in the presence of this
[1:44:44] light and the light said this is home.
[1:44:46] This is where you belong. I am that I
[1:44:48] am. You belong to me.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; I say, "Praise be to God."
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; Let's give him a praise offering.
[1:45:05] You're worthy, Lord.
[1:45:18] Hallelujah.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Shake somebody's hand beside
[1:45:24] you and say, "I am redeemed."
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:40] Hallelujah.
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; I'm redeemed, buddy. I'm redeemed. I'm
[1:45:46] redeemed. Y'all come over here. I'm not
[1:45:48] coming down there. I'm redeemed. I'm
[1:45:50] redeemed.
[1:45:51] [Applause]
[1:45:58] Now
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; here stands the mighty God veiled in a
[1:46:07] temple of humiliation
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; where Greeks would say we want to see
[1:46:11] Jesus.
[1:46:13] Philillip knew where to take him. They
[1:46:17] got there and all they saw was a human
[1:46:20] temple.
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; That's so good.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; All they saw was the veil that
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; had a Kentucky vernacular.
[1:46:29] [Laughter]
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me now?
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; Well, no. I'm not making him Jesus.
[1:46:35] Don't you dare think that. What I'm
[1:46:37] trying to tell you is is that's the
[1:46:39] glory of the redemption through the
[1:46:41] blood. That God was able to so procure
[1:46:44] or to bring to himself a people that he
[1:46:47] could reflect himself through
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; unhindered.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; This is the hour of the revealing of the
[1:46:55] son of man
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; through a son of man. Amen.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; And God has always chose to hide it be
[1:47:03] behind badger skins.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; But but not while they were alive. You
[1:47:08] know, you you can't have a live badger
[1:47:10] and God step behind there.
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; But God knows how
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; to bring death to that badger nature
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; that's ruling over one of his children.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me now? The word is a
[1:47:24] discerner.
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; The word separates you from you.
[1:47:29] It separates that badger nature from a
[1:47:32] son and daughter of God.
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; And that's why that badger nature wants
[1:47:36] to run, wants to pull away, but that son
[1:47:38] of God begins to get a little warm
[1:47:39] underneath the presence of the Lord. And
[1:47:41] and then in the rain, hold on a minute.
[1:47:44] We ain't going nowhere here. And that
[1:47:45] badger, oh my, he's he's getting
[1:47:47] nervous. He's get he's getting nervous.
[1:47:48] Why? The light is exposing him.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? He's getting
[1:47:53] nervous. I got to get out of here. I got
[1:47:54] to He's trying to move away, trying to
[1:47:56] put thoughts through your mind and
[1:47:57] trying to get you. But notice as a son
[1:47:59] of God just standing right there in the
[1:48:01] presence of the sen. Oh, it's just
[1:48:03] something about it. As he begins to warm
[1:48:06] in that presence, what's happening?
[1:48:07] There is an authority that is rising in
[1:48:10] that sun that will lead him to a place
[1:48:14] of full surrender.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; That's the truth.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; Now, here was the Lord Jesus. I could
[1:48:22] have read this to you, but you you've
[1:48:24] read in your Bible.
[1:48:27] Here stands the Lord of glory
[1:48:30] in a temple of humiliation.
[1:48:33] He is declaring
[1:48:35] the purpose. He's restoring that of what
[1:48:38] he meant man to be,
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; a dwelling place, God's place of rest,
[1:48:44] God's place of habitation.
[1:48:47] And so here he lays aside his splendor.
[1:48:51] He comes down and he becomes one of us.
[1:48:55] Sure, he goes through all of the
[1:48:58] pressures. Tempted like we like we're
[1:49:00] tempted. Pressures why? That he might
[1:49:03] understand us.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; So he's gone through all of that. As he
[1:49:07] stands there in the temple, the Bible
[1:49:09] says he came into the temple in John 2.
[1:49:12] It also speaks of it in Mark. Speaks of
[1:49:13] it in Matthew. And he came into the
[1:49:16] temple, the earthly temple that was
[1:49:18] there that had been patterned all the
[1:49:22] way back from heaven to Moses
[1:49:26] there. Solomon now here with Herod's
[1:49:29] temple all of this the pattern it had
[1:49:31] been in heavenly pattern but it had got
[1:49:34] away from the heavenly purpose.
[1:49:38] They were going through the sacrifices
[1:49:40] going through the motions. But when
[1:49:43] Jesus came, the Bible says when he came
[1:49:47] there in John chapter 2, let me just I
[1:49:50] want to refer to this here so I don't
[1:49:52] miss a word in there. In John chapter 2,
[1:49:56] when he reads this, he comes into the
[1:49:59] temple.
[1:50:04] You're like me. I'm always running my
[1:50:05] mind. Matthew, Mark, Luke, John.
[1:50:15] John chapter 2.
[1:50:22] Yeah. Yeah. Here. Verse 13. And the Jews
[1:50:25] Passover was at hand. And Jesus went up
[1:50:27] to Jerusalem and found in the temple
[1:50:29] those that sold oxen, sheep, and doves
[1:50:33] and chargers of money. And when he had
[1:50:36] made a scourge of small cords, he drove
[1:50:38] them out of the temple, and the sheep
[1:50:39] and the oxen, and poured out the
[1:50:41] changers money, and overthrew the
[1:50:43] tables. And he said unto them that sold
[1:50:45] doves, take these things hence, and make
[1:50:48] not my father's house and house of
[1:50:50] merchandise.
[1:50:52] And his disciples remembered that it was
[1:50:54] written, "The zeal of thine house hath
[1:50:58] eaten me up."
[1:51:00] Jesus and the Jews answered him and
[1:51:02] said, "What what sign showest thou,
[1:51:04] seeing that thou doest these things?"
[1:51:08] Jesus answered and said, "Destroy this
[1:51:10] temple and in three days I will raise it
[1:51:13] up."
[1:51:14] And you know, they they didn't
[1:51:16] understand that. But I I want to I want
[1:51:18] to draw your attention to this
[1:51:21] because
[1:51:23] when you consider
[1:51:25] all of the doves, all of the animals
[1:51:29] that were there,
[1:51:31] it was made possible
[1:51:34] by the priests permitting in the court
[1:51:36] of the Gentiles
[1:51:38] them to come and to sell
[1:51:41] these sacrifices.
[1:51:44] so man could take his money and go
[1:51:47] purchase a sacrifice. And the reasoning
[1:51:52] was Jehovah requires blood.
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; He wants worship. And in order for us to
[1:51:58] worship, there's got to be blood.
[1:52:02] There's got to be a sacrifice. So the
[1:52:04] priests were providing that opportunity
[1:52:09] that way for the people.
[1:52:12] Yeah, that's good.
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; Now, just stay with me here.
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram says in the message paradox,
[1:52:22] I just want you to listen to this. He
[1:52:24] said they had some, you know, Jehovah,
[1:52:26] Jehovah requires a lamb for your sins,
[1:52:28] and now you didn't have to raise lambs.
[1:52:30] They had sellers go up there in the
[1:52:32] courts, make little cages, put lambs in
[1:52:34] there that you could take your income
[1:52:35] that you've made and made not of lambs,
[1:52:38] but you made something else to keep our
[1:52:40] economy going.
[1:52:42] So he says, "But God didn't want your
[1:52:44] money. He said a lamb and you went and
[1:52:46] bought a lamb."
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; He goes on in 64 when their eyes were
[1:52:52] open. He said, "See, they were
[1:52:53] marketing."
[1:52:55] You said they didn't have to raise
[1:52:57] lambs. The priests made a way that they
[1:52:59] could clear their soul according to the
[1:53:02] word of God. And they built little cages
[1:53:04] out there in the courts. Now, I want to
[1:53:06] say this. These priests could argue and
[1:53:08] say, "What are you doing? You are
[1:53:10] robbing these people from worship.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; You've loosened all these sacrifices. We
[1:53:17] know for sure you're a false prophet
[1:53:19] because Jehovah required these
[1:53:22] sacrifices.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; Looks like controversy.
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; Looks like confusion.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; But little did they know here was the
[1:53:34] Lord of glory
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; standing
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; in this human temple. absolutely
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; restoring
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; and was to reclaim not just the purpose
[1:53:43] of that temple
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; but through that would show how he would
[1:53:49] reclaim every one of his children.
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; Let me just say this to you.
[1:53:57] God himself.
[1:53:59] Religion. Religion is not a convenience
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; where there's no sacrifice required, no
[1:54:05] no labor, no toiling of their own, but
[1:54:07] simply purchasing a lamb. Meaning had
[1:54:10] been lost. But God's desire for man to
[1:54:12] have fellowship was through the shedding
[1:54:14] of the blood by revelation. Like God
[1:54:17] entrusted your possession. In other
[1:54:19] words, remember Blind Barnameus? When
[1:54:22] Blind Barnameus was going to offer that
[1:54:24] lamb and the priest said, "Not that
[1:54:26] lamb.
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; We've got a substitute for you." He
[1:54:30] said, "I never promised God a
[1:54:32] substitute.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; I promise God this lamb."
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; You know what that was in in in
[1:54:38] Barnameus's heart? That wasn't just a
[1:54:40] story. That was an expression of God's
[1:54:44] heart.
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; God didn't send a substitute. Amen.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; He didn't send somebody else to take
[1:54:50] your place.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; God himself came down and took our
[1:54:56] place.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; He came among religion. He came among
[1:55:01] the denominations. He came among the
[1:55:04] churches. He found substitutes. Yes.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; If you're good enough, if you can do
[1:55:10] good enough, if you can say say enough
[1:55:12] rosaries or whatever they're called or
[1:55:14] Hail Marys or or whatever they're
[1:55:15] novenas, whatever they are they're
[1:55:16] called. If you can do this, you're going
[1:55:17] to put your name on a book. You're not
[1:55:19] saved by putting your name under a book.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; You're not saved by an association with
[1:55:24] a group of people. There's only one
[1:55:26] place of safety and that is under the
[1:55:29] blood.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? That's why
[1:55:34] denominations judgments on them cuz
[1:55:37] they've rejected the blood.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; You say, "How can you say that?" Look at
[1:55:41] the lives that are projected out of
[1:55:43] there.
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; It's not the life of the word.
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; I'm not Listen, there's good people in
[1:55:49] there. They've been led astray. I'm not
[1:55:51] speaking against the people. I'm talking
[1:55:53] about the system.
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; It's a walled up system.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; And here God steps down.
[1:56:04] even in the end time. And what he finds,
[1:56:07] what did he find in some of our lives?
[1:56:10] Rituals
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; tied by religions,
[1:56:16] becoming ceremonious on Easter,
[1:56:20] becoming religious on Christmas. Where
[1:56:22] did he find in our lives? I trust he
[1:56:25] still doesn't find us just living out
[1:56:27] ceremonial lives
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; just to just, oh, it's Sunday again. No,
[1:56:32] every day should be a Sunday.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; But it's not an SU day. It's an S day.
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; And what do you mean by that, brother
[1:56:38] Samuel? I mean that the life there's a
[1:56:41] life that you live no matter whether
[1:56:43] you're inside of these four walls or
[1:56:45] not. It's not just that you're under the
[1:56:46] anointing of the Holy Spirit. You have
[1:56:48] the anointing of the Holy Spirit in your
[1:56:50] life that is anointing that word in your
[1:56:52] life to live out Christ.
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; He found in the temple. He found them.
[1:57:00] You don't have to raise a lamb. Just buy
[1:57:02] one.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; You You don't have to. There's There's
[1:57:06] one for you to buy.
[1:57:12] But God never came or sent a substitute.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; God came himself.
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; He's a leader. Remember what I said in
[1:57:19] the beginning? He's a leader.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; He never asked you to do something that
[1:57:23] he has not willing to do himself.
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; So good.
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; He did not send second best. He did not
[1:57:30] send something else.
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; He didn't even take of what was already
[1:57:35] here.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; The search was made and no man was found
[1:57:38] worthy.
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; He didn't take of what was here because
[1:57:43] all of that blood was polluted. Every
[1:57:46] man stood in need of redemption.
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; You and I stood in need of redemption.
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; There's no such thing as a holy man as
[1:57:57] the Holy Ghost in the man. Right?
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; So notice within this contaminated they
[1:58:06] made that they made the tradition the
[1:58:08] commandments of God tradition.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; It was like when you can read this when
[1:58:15] you get home in 2 Samuel chapter 24 and
[1:58:18] verse 18. Don't worry I'm coming down
[1:58:19] but don't don't close me out yet. This
[1:58:20] is this is important.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; Remember God's a leader. That's right.
[1:58:24] Come on now.
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; You can read this when you get home in 2
[1:58:27] Samuel chapter 24
[1:58:30] and verse 18-2.
[1:58:32] The ark
[1:58:34] was down in the house of Aroni. Orana
[1:58:41] of Onan I believe it was.
[1:58:44] And there's a plague that's come upon
[1:58:45] the land of Israel.
[1:58:49] And David is moved to offer a sacrifice.
[1:58:54] And he's to go to by the threshing floor
[1:58:58] of this man.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; And he comes into that threshing floor.
[1:59:02] Listen to me. I want you just follow
[1:59:03] this here just a moment.
[1:59:06] The man shows up and says, "Take it, my
[1:59:09] king.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; Take all of these take all of these
[1:59:13] offerings
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; and stay the plague."
[1:59:17] David said, "Nay,
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; I will not offer unto my God
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; that which cost me nothing."
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; You see, to be a worshipper, there's a
[1:59:31] cost.
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; To come back into fellowship with God,
[1:59:34] there's a cost.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; And that cost was made by God himself
[1:59:39] coming down and paying the price so that
[1:59:42] you and I, you and I, you and I might
[1:59:45] pay the price. by surrendering our own
[1:59:47] lives.
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; This is why Jesus before he ever went to
[1:59:51] his cross said, "If any man will take up
[1:59:53] his cross and come after me and follow
[1:59:55] me,
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; If he wants to hang on to his life,
[1:59:59] he'll lose it.
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; But if he's willing to lose it,
[2:00:01] surrender it, then he shall have life."
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; See the here it is. It's it's presented
[2:00:08] the the the here with with with where it
[2:00:11] was at the threshing floor of Arana, the
[2:00:13] Jebusite. offered him and David said,
[2:00:15] "No, I'm going to buy it of you."
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; This was this was an example. What we
[2:00:23] just read in John chapter 2, what we're
[2:00:25] reading here is an example of what God
[2:00:28] has done for you and I.
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; God doesn't do anything that he had
[2:00:33] asked us to do something that he hasn't
[2:00:35] already done and made a way you and I
[2:00:37] couldn't even die to ourselves. We could
[2:00:40] not be born again until the blood was
[2:00:43] shed and the Holy Spirit has come back.
[2:00:45] There was no way made into the Holiest
[2:00:48] of Holies.
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; So good.
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; They couldn't get back in fellowship
[2:00:52] with God. I'm not talking about
[2:00:54] religion.
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about a relationship.
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; That's so good.
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; You said, "I'll buy this threshing
[2:01:03] floor."
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; Well, here you can take the offerings.
[2:01:06] No,
[2:01:08] I'll buy the offerings.
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; And God made purchase.
[2:01:14] God laid down his own life.
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, he did.
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; He thought more of you,
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; your fellowship. Let me tell you his
[2:01:23] last request in John 17, the last
[2:01:26] request that he made of the father,
[2:01:29] grant that where I am,
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; they may be also.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; What was that? That was the heart's cry
[2:01:37] of the father all along. I want them to
[2:01:39] be where I am.
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; Do you understand where he is? He wants
[2:01:44] you to be under the blood. He wants you
[2:01:46] to be in fellowship. He wants to so
[2:01:48] change your life and be in fellowship
[2:01:50] and communion with you. He wants to
[2:01:52] deliver you from the bondage of
[2:01:54] religion.
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; To where that you're a living
[2:01:58] expression.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; Wherefore come out from among them.
[2:02:01] Separate.
[2:02:03] &gt;&gt; Separate. that the prophet said he's
[2:02:05] calling Abraham's seed to separate from
[2:02:07] seed, taste, feel, smell, hear, separate
[2:02:09] from reasoning, conscience, imagination,
[2:02:12] affections. Come out Abraham and live
[2:02:14] with me.
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; That's what God did.
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; See the way that God is required. He
[2:02:24] didn't want just any lamb.
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:02:27] &gt;&gt; He don't want any other sacrifice. Well,
[2:02:29] Lord, I've done this. I Lord, you don't
[2:02:32] know what I do for my community. That's
[2:02:33] wonderful. I'm not making light of that.
[2:02:36] But you don't merit your way into the
[2:02:38] kingdom of God.
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; Lord, you know what I've done for this
[2:02:41] one? You know what I've done? All those
[2:02:42] things are wonderful. That's wonderful.
[2:02:45] But what does that have to do with
[2:02:46] salvation?
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; If that's what was required, if that's
[2:02:50] what was required, then surely God would
[2:02:54] never had to become one of us.
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; Calvary then would have been, what was
[2:02:58] Calvary? Just a show? Was Calvary just
[2:03:01] something that we sing a few songs
[2:03:03] about, something that we get emotional
[2:03:05] about? Or did Calvary have a meaning?
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me, church?
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; Is the grace of God just something that
[2:03:13] we're enamored with and and we've been
[2:03:15] painted a picture as though that oh, the
[2:03:18] grace of God, it allows me to get by
[2:03:19] with my sin. That's not the grace of
[2:03:21] God.
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; I'm here to tell you that's a wrong
[2:03:24] picture. What the grace of God comes to
[2:03:26] do is give you and I what we did not
[2:03:29] deserve.
[2:03:31] &gt;&gt; We didn't have what was necessary to
[2:03:34] make the sacrifice. But God himself came
[2:03:37] down and became the sacrifice that you
[2:03:40] and I might willingly offer
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; our lives
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; to him.
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; Our all
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; the way we talk, the way we act, the way
[2:03:52] we dress. I'm not just talking about
[2:03:54] something out here, but I'm talking
[2:03:56] about what's in here comes out through
[2:03:58] here.
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; You can't you that that's called
[2:04:01] confusion. If you say you're something
[2:04:02] here and something else is out here,
[2:04:04] that's called uncertainty. That's called
[2:04:06] confusion. That's called Babylon.
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; Because there's two there's there's two
[2:04:13] different voices.
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; But that voice has got to be clear. And
[2:04:17] the voice of the blood is a clear voice.
[2:04:19] When the voice of the blood has struck
[2:04:21] your soul, it cries out, "Redeemed." And
[2:04:24] through your life, it is declared, "You
[2:04:26] are redeemed. You are a Christian. You
[2:04:28] are a believer. You're a son of God."
[2:04:30] And the seal of the living God upon your
[2:04:32] life. A seal like a notary seal on a
[2:04:35] document. You can fill it on the front
[2:04:36] and on the back. In the coming and the
[2:04:38] going, you are a son of God,
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; a daughter of God.
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[2:04:46] &gt;&gt; Remember, he didn't ask you to do
[2:04:47] something he has not done himself. He
[2:04:49] the son of man whom the father has
[2:04:51] sealed.
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; Gave his stamp of approval, his
[2:04:54] vindication. This is my
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; son.
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; Hear you him.
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; Just say it in this way. God himself
[2:05:05] restored that. It's got to be the lamb
[2:05:08] of your life.
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; You're all that you're willing to lay
[2:05:12] down.
[2:05:14] Lord, I do this and do. Remember, God
[2:05:16] told Saul,
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; obedience
[2:05:21] is better than sacrifice.
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; Listen, friend, I'm just going to tell
[2:05:25] you, I don't want to stand there on that
[2:05:27] day and I don't want to trust in my
[2:05:30] works.
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; You understand what you trust in your
[2:05:33] works? You got a lamb that you're
[2:05:35] offering instead of taking the lamb.
[2:05:37] Right.
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; And the Bible said there will be books
[2:05:41] open. If you miss the rapture, books are
[2:05:45] open at the white throne judgment with
[2:05:47] no blood present.
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; And judgment is based on what you have
[2:05:53] done.
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; What you have heard?
[2:05:56] &gt;&gt; How have you how have you how have you
[2:05:58] responded? Because listen, do you
[2:06:00] realize when when when when for a person
[2:06:03] to stand there on that day, it's already
[2:06:05] they've already had a grueling reality
[2:06:07] of missing the rapture and missing it
[2:06:09] all the way through.
[2:06:11] &gt;&gt; But then to stand there again in that
[2:06:12] time, I want you to I want you to
[2:06:15] understand this here, friends, that if
[2:06:17] you even if you I wouldn't want to stand
[2:06:19] there on my works.
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; Your works will never merit it.
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:06:27] Oh, I I I I've had this felt this
[2:06:29] anointing that'll never merit it. It's
[2:06:31] got to come all the way down to the soul
[2:06:33] to where you accept God's provided way.
[2:06:37] &gt;&gt; You accept it. Don't Don't try to
[2:06:38] wrestle whether you're worthy. I'll just
[2:06:40] go ahead and tell you, you're not
[2:06:41] worthy. Neither am I worthy. You
[2:06:43] couldn't be worthy enough. You can't
[2:06:45] make yourself worthy enough. God's not
[2:06:47] asking you to make yourself worthy. He's
[2:06:50] asking you, will you accept my provided
[2:06:52] way?
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And not another lamb, not a
[2:06:56] different lamb. This is the lamb.
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; That's why this revealing of this
[2:07:02] message is not a revealing of another
[2:07:04] lamb. It's not another Jesus.
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; It's the revealing of the lamb of God.
[2:07:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; The lamb of God who hath already taken
[2:07:15] away the sin of the world. It's the lamb
[2:07:17] of God being revealed. His life being
[2:07:19] revealed and tabernacled inside of a
[2:07:22] group of people. his victory pulsating
[2:07:24] through their lives.
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; Behold the lamb of God.
[2:07:29] Do you love him?
[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; Remember, God didn't require you to do
[2:07:38] something
[2:07:39] &gt;&gt; that he's not willing to do
[2:07:42] &gt;&gt; and has done himself.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; He didn't send the substitute.
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; So, he doesn't want you to give him a
[2:07:48] substitute.
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; Lord, I I'll give you my strength.
[2:07:52] Samson gave him his strength.
[2:07:55] &gt;&gt; Lord, I'll give you my mind. That's
[2:07:56] wonderful. But God wants more than your
[2:07:58] mind.
[2:08:00] &gt;&gt; He paid the price of redemption for your
[2:08:03] soul.
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; Because if God carries long enough, this
[2:08:07] body will corrupt and go by the way of
[2:08:10] the grave. And that human spirit will
[2:08:13] break up. And the soul, which is what's
[2:08:15] been the real value the whole time,
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; that's good. That is what's going to
[2:08:22] matter.
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; Coming to that of the rapture. What is
[2:08:26] the rapture? The rapture is the
[2:08:28] harvesting of the treasure that's within
[2:08:31] the earth.
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; That's so good.
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; God already knows. Just like a person
[2:08:37] said, "Oh, I know there's oil here. I
[2:08:38] know there's gold here." What do they
[2:08:39] do? They mark out that whole place,
[2:08:40] don't they? They know there's oil here.
[2:08:42] Oh, there's precious ore. There's
[2:08:43] precious mine. God knows in his word
[2:08:46] there's precious gold. There's a people
[2:08:48] that's to come out under my name's sake.
[2:08:50] There's to be a people without spot,
[2:08:52] wrinkle, or blemish. And what has God?
[2:08:53] God has already marked the boundaries of
[2:08:56] his word through predestination. And no
[2:08:58] wonder, like David, you can say, "The
[2:09:00] lines have fallen concerning me in
[2:09:02] pleasant places."
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:05] &gt;&gt; I find myself within this gold mine of
[2:09:08] God's word, of revealed word. What's he
[2:09:10] going to do? He's going to harvest
[2:09:13] &gt;&gt; harvest
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; his seed
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; back home. Yes.
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; A people
[2:09:20] that where were the purpose
[2:09:23] has been restored
[2:09:25] back in their lives.
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; Let me just say this to you.
[2:09:31] God entrusted you and I with this
[2:09:34] message
[2:09:37] to even be able to see this this deep
[2:09:40] call to him. Let me just drop this when
[2:09:41] I say this right here.
[2:09:44] I I want to encourage you. If you're not
[2:09:47] listening to the message,
[2:09:49] &gt;&gt; you need to get into it.
[2:09:51] &gt;&gt; That's good preaching.
[2:09:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, I listen to a lot of singing.
[2:09:55] Singing is wonderful. But get into the
[2:09:57] message.
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; Let me just tell you something. Let me
[2:10:00] let me tell you the power of this
[2:10:01] message. If you get into this message
[2:10:02] and say, "God, make yourself known to
[2:10:04] me.
[2:10:06] &gt;&gt; Lord, you know what I have need of." And
[2:10:07] he does. And he has just what we need,
[2:10:09] the bread and wine. That's right.
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; I said he has just what we need, the
[2:10:12] bread and wine.
[2:10:13] &gt;&gt; You just you to give yourself to him.
[2:10:15] Oh, brother Sam, I don't understand
[2:10:16] everything. Just turn away that
[2:10:17] scarecrow of the enemy
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; because it's not about your natural
[2:10:21] mind.
[2:10:22] &gt;&gt; But it's get yourself get into this
[2:10:24] message. Listen, friends, that's what
[2:10:26] we're ministering. We're preaching when
[2:10:28] we're talking about the message. We're
[2:10:29] talking about the revealed scripture of
[2:10:31] the hour.
[2:10:33] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. God's here to
[2:10:34] lead you instead of going around the
[2:10:36] same mountain over and over and over and
[2:10:38] over and over. Get into the message.
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; Open it up on your phone.
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; If you want to know, brother Samuel,
[2:10:47] what are some messages?
[2:10:49] Text me.
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; Text somebody else. Text some of these
[2:10:52] others who came in years and years ahead
[2:10:54] of me. Text text different ones. You
[2:10:56] don't even have to just text me. But
[2:10:57] here's what I'm going to tell you. Just
[2:10:59] put it on.
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; And you put it on, you start listening
[2:11:02] to it. You watch. It's not the voice of
[2:11:04] a Kuckian that's changing your life.
[2:11:08] It'll drive away that gloom, that
[2:11:10] darkness, that confusion. You know why?
[2:11:13] Because it is the light of God.
[2:11:17] [Applause]
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; It's a voice. Though you might hear a
[2:11:21] Kentucky vernacular, but that voice that
[2:11:23] you're hearing is the thoughts of God.
[2:11:26] The Bible says in in the book of
[2:11:28] Revelations, "Come out from among her,
[2:11:31] my people."
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; Right? And be not partaker. Brother
[2:11:36] Brandham said that voice as it sounded
[2:11:38] in heaven, he said what it was is the
[2:11:41] messenger on earth that was proclaiming
[2:11:43] that same message was so inclined with
[2:11:47] heaven that it was echoing back through
[2:11:50] heaven.
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Samuel, I can't wait to get
[2:11:56] to heaven. Heaven has come down.
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:04] Oh, sure. I'm expecting to go to heaven,
[2:12:07] but heaven has come down. Heavenly
[2:12:09] places are right here among us this
[2:12:11] morning.
[2:12:13] &gt;&gt; If all of hell has been emptied out,
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; then all of heaven has come down.
[2:12:22] &gt;&gt; You know why?
[2:12:24] &gt;&gt; Because now there's a battle that's
[2:12:25] raging.
[2:12:28] &gt;&gt; Forces of darkness
[2:12:31] &gt;&gt; against that of light. the pressures you
[2:12:34] feel,
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; the battles you go through,
[2:12:38] things that would like to silence that
[2:12:40] voice in your life, tests, trials.
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; But let me just tell you something. That
[2:12:46] voice inside of your life is a voice
[2:12:49] that's been sealed there.
[2:12:51] &gt;&gt; God,
[2:12:52] &gt;&gt; and God himself has anointed and
[2:12:55] released you like he did Isaiah.
[2:12:57] Everybody with me?
[2:12:59] &gt;&gt; You've come into the temple of God. And
[2:13:02] in God's presence,
[2:13:04] you begin to see your weakness. You
[2:13:07] begin to see
[2:13:08] &gt;&gt; your need.
[2:13:10] &gt;&gt; No wonder, brother Brandham says in that
[2:13:12] message, he said, "Will you take a
[2:13:14] journey with me to the temple this
[2:13:16] morning?" He said, "I'm not talking
[2:13:18] about over to Jerusalem. I'm talking
[2:13:20] about your heart."
[2:13:23] &gt;&gt; Go to that place. And then you say,
[2:13:25] "Whoa, Lord, woe is me. I'm a man of
[2:13:28] unclean lips."
[2:13:29] And God knows how to take care of that.
[2:13:32] &gt;&gt; He sends a He send what does he do? He
[2:13:34] didn't He didn't He didn't chastise
[2:13:35] Isaiah. He went and got what the need
[2:13:38] called for.
[2:13:40] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, your situation in your
[2:13:42] life is an opportunity for God to make
[2:13:45] his glory known.
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Samuel, I got this habit.
[2:13:49] But that don't look at that habit any
[2:13:51] longer as though that this is, oh, this
[2:13:53] is what I've carried all this time. This
[2:13:54] is what I have. But now, go ahead and
[2:13:56] start confessing it. This is an
[2:13:58] opportunity for the glory of God to come
[2:14:01] down in my life.
[2:14:03] &gt;&gt; It's an opportunity. Somebody else might
[2:14:05] have dealt with this, might have dealt
[2:14:06] with this way, but God, I'm going to be
[2:14:08] your witness as an overcomer that the
[2:14:11] grace of God is greater than this habit.
[2:14:13] It's greater than this besetting sin.
[2:14:15] It's greater than this weight.
[2:14:19] He's inspiring you. He's not leading you
[2:14:22] out on some goose chase.
[2:14:25] &gt;&gt; Come on. And he's not leading you out
[2:14:27] into the wilderness to a big bowl of
[2:14:29] Kool-Aid.
[2:14:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, amen.
[2:14:31] &gt;&gt; This isn't a cult.
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; This is the gathering of eagles.
[2:14:35] &gt;&gt; We've been gathered to the fresh carcass
[2:14:37] of the word. It's this word that's
[2:14:40] changing us. And all we see is Jesus
[2:14:42] Christ.
[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; It's him that's changing our lives.
[2:14:48] &gt;&gt; Lord, I'll be your witness.
[2:14:51] &gt;&gt; I'll submit that. Whatever that is in my
[2:14:53] I'll submit it to you, Lord. You're
[2:14:54] greater than this.
[2:14:56] &gt;&gt; I'm going to go ahead and say it as a
[2:14:57] son and daughter of God. You're greater
[2:14:59] than this situation in my life.
[2:15:01] &gt;&gt; You're greater than this need. And I'm
[2:15:03] going to go ahead and say I'm free.
[2:15:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:05] &gt;&gt; Brother Samuel say I'm free.
[2:15:08] &gt;&gt; I'm free because he has said I am free.
[2:15:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:12] &gt;&gt; This isn't mind over matter. It's saying
[2:15:14] what the word is saying.
[2:15:16] &gt;&gt; I'm free. I'm a son and daughter of God.
[2:15:19] &gt;&gt; I'm purchased. I'm bought with the blood
[2:15:21] of Jesus Christ.
[2:15:26] And I'm not going to give him a
[2:15:27] substitute.
[2:15:28] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[2:15:29] &gt;&gt; The days of substitutes are over.
[2:15:33] &gt;&gt; I want to give him my all.
[2:15:36] &gt;&gt; I want to give him my all.
[2:15:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:39] &gt;&gt; He gave his all
[2:15:41] &gt;&gt; for you.
[2:15:42] &gt;&gt; He gave his all for me.
[2:15:44] &gt;&gt; They offered him. They offered him.
[2:15:48] &gt;&gt; Hey,
[2:15:50] worship me. I'll give you all the
[2:15:51] kingdoms of this world.
[2:15:54] &gt;&gt; He was tempted. The prophet said he was
[2:15:56] tempted. He was tempted because he knew
[2:15:59] what to lay wait for him. He was
[2:16:00] tempted.
[2:16:03] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:16:05] &gt;&gt; He drew back.
[2:16:07] Get behind me, Satan.
[2:16:10] &gt;&gt; Thou shalt worship the Lord God only.
[2:16:18] Let me tell you, if the Bible says he
[2:16:20] endured for seeing the joy that was set
[2:16:22] before him, you know what that joy was?
[2:16:24] That joy was that you might have joy.
[2:16:27] &gt;&gt; That I might have joy.
[2:16:29] &gt;&gt; Where I was bound, I was covered over
[2:16:32] with darkness that I might have joy.
[2:16:33] That you might have joy. You know why he
[2:16:35] stood? You know why he did that? When he
[2:16:36] was offered to take the easier way. You
[2:16:39] know why he did that?
[2:16:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:16:43] [Applause]
[2:16:45] Hallelujah.
[2:16:48] &gt;&gt; That's why he did it.
[2:16:49] &gt;&gt; He didn't do it for himself cuz it
[2:16:52] wasn't the easy way. It was the harder
[2:16:54] way that he chose.
[2:16:57] &gt;&gt; Thou has chosen the harder way.
[2:17:01] &gt;&gt; And that way is my way.
[2:17:05] &gt;&gt; And because of this choice, a huge
[2:17:08] portion of heaven
[2:17:11] &gt;&gt; awaits thee.
[2:17:15] He could have given an easy a
[2:17:17] substitute, but he gave himself.
[2:17:23] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you,
[2:17:25] &gt;&gt; he doesn't want substitutes. He wants
[2:17:28] you.
[2:17:30] &gt;&gt; He shed his blood
[2:17:33] that he might bring you back to himself.
[2:17:35] And the spirit, the life that was within
[2:17:37] that blood would go and begin to sound.
[2:17:41] The priest would ride the land. The Holy
[2:17:43] Spirit moving throughout the land has
[2:17:45] been sounding that trumpet and saying,
[2:17:47] "You're free.
[2:17:49] &gt;&gt; You're free." But but Lord, I got this I
[2:17:52] got this habit. I got this situation in
[2:17:54] my head. You're free.
[2:17:56] &gt;&gt; You're free. What do you mean? Just drop
[2:17:57] it. Just drop it.
[2:17:59] &gt;&gt; When you hear the trumpet, the trumpet
[2:18:02] is the authority to drop it.
[2:18:05] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me this morning? This
[2:18:07] isn't a good message. It's God letting
[2:18:09] you know what belongs to you.
[2:18:14] &gt;&gt; It's been broke up all over the board.
[2:18:16] It's not about a good message. It's God
[2:18:18] speaking to our needs.
[2:18:20] &gt;&gt; He doesn't want just half. He'll take
[2:18:22] what you're giving. But he wants all of
[2:18:24] you.
[2:18:26] &gt;&gt; If you'll give your all, he gave his all
[2:18:28] for you. And he will pour himself into
[2:18:31] your life.
[2:18:34] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[2:18:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:36] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[2:18:43] I say what he did for you, what he did
[2:18:45] for me, he's deserving of it all.
[2:18:49] &gt;&gt; He made a way
[2:18:51] &gt;&gt; for you and I.
[2:18:55] &gt;&gt; I tell you friends, this is a moment
[2:18:56] this morning.
[2:18:58] &gt;&gt; If you need if you need God, you need
[2:19:00] the spirit of God. You need a touch in
[2:19:02] your life this morning. I'm not pulling
[2:19:04] on you. I'm just telling you right here.
[2:19:06] God has come down.
[2:19:08] &gt;&gt; And I could tell you he totally when I
[2:19:11] came back home Friday, I got home. You
[2:19:13] all know we got home late on Friday.
[2:19:14] Those you know we were there. We got
[2:19:16] home late on Friday and I could not I
[2:19:18] got off to myself. Things begin to turn.
[2:19:20] The outline was already together. Things
[2:19:23] I was already moving under that
[2:19:24] inspiration, but God began to turn it.
[2:19:26] And all of these things I couldn't
[2:19:27] hardly sleep Friday to Saturday. I was
[2:19:30] upset. I couldn't wait to get it all
[2:19:31] being bringing these parts in together
[2:19:33] because I'm telling you why this was not
[2:19:35] this is not just a message. I don't want
[2:19:37] to just preach messages. I'm interested
[2:19:40] in souls.
[2:19:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:19:43] &gt;&gt; Brother Sam, you may not be a good
[2:19:44] speaker. I'm not trying to be a good
[2:19:45] speaker. I'm trying to win souls. I'm
[2:19:48] trying to lives that lives would give
[2:19:50] their all for him who gave his all for
[2:19:52] us.
[2:19:53] &gt;&gt; God, look what God did in this hour. He
[2:19:55] brought a man that didn't even have a
[2:19:57] seventh grade education and stood before
[2:20:00] great doctors.
[2:20:02] &gt;&gt; You think he didn't have to overcome the
[2:20:04] humiliation in his flesh?
[2:20:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:08] &gt;&gt; And stand there when he couldn't even
[2:20:09] pronounce certain words
[2:20:11] &gt;&gt; and these men behind him could pronounce
[2:20:13] those words. They could go right through
[2:20:15] them.
[2:20:17] &gt;&gt; But you know why? Let me tell you why
[2:20:18] God chose to do it that way. so that you
[2:20:20] and I could look at that and say, "God,
[2:20:21] if you took it to where we cannot even
[2:20:23] pronounce words, we may not even know
[2:20:25] those words, but if I can recognize God,
[2:20:27] if I can recognize who's in my midst, if
[2:20:29] I can recognize him, then I can re have
[2:20:31] whatever that I have need of in him,
[2:20:34] there's a longing I can have that
[2:20:37] &gt;&gt; God took a man that didn't have a
[2:20:39] seventh grade education to show his
[2:20:41] glory.
[2:20:42] &gt;&gt; To show you and I it doesn't take your
[2:20:44] intellect. God never wanted your
[2:20:46] intellect.
[2:20:49] &gt;&gt; Denominations are harvesting intellect,
[2:20:52] reasoning.
[2:20:53] &gt;&gt; I'm not I'm not throwing them down, but
[2:20:56] they can only operate what they're
[2:20:57] under.
[2:20:58] &gt;&gt; But God never came to harvest that. The
[2:21:01] Lamb's book of life came to call lambs.
[2:21:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:09] &gt;&gt; The names of the lambs
[2:21:12] &gt;&gt; on the lamb's book of life. Remember
[2:21:16] predestination before he came to the
[2:21:19] river Jordan,
[2:21:20] &gt;&gt; he was already a lamb.
[2:21:22] &gt;&gt; John said, "Behold the lamb of God."
[2:21:25] &gt;&gt; See, the Holy Spirit laying claim on
[2:21:27] your life. You're mine. You've always
[2:21:30] belonged to me. You're my lamb. My sheep
[2:21:33] know my voice.
[2:21:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I say this morning, Lord, I
[2:21:41] want to give my all.
[2:21:44] I want to give my all.
[2:21:47] &gt;&gt; I want to give everything that I am,
[2:21:48] Lord. Hallelujah. Wherever you might be
[2:21:52] within your walk with God. Hallelujah.
[2:21:54] If you listen, if you want prayer here
[2:21:56] this morning, I'm here to pray with you.
[2:21:58] We're here to We're here to pray.
[2:21:59] There's other Listen, and it's not just
[2:22:01] me standing here, but all through this
[2:22:02] building, this is priest of God,
[2:22:05] &gt;&gt; and we're here to pray. We're here that
[2:22:07] that same that same breakthrough that
[2:22:09] took place in our life that it might
[2:22:11] take place in your life.
[2:22:13] Hallelujah. What What are you going to
[2:22:14] do? I'm going to give my all. I'm going
[2:22:16] to lay aside my pride. I'm going to lay
[2:22:18] aside everything else. I'm going to lay
[2:22:20] everything down because giving my all to
[2:22:22] him, he gave his all for me.
[2:22:25] &gt;&gt; I want him to have all of me.
[2:22:28] &gt;&gt; I want him to have everything that I am.
[2:22:30] I want to rededicate my life to him.
[2:22:32] &gt;&gt; I want him to have all of my life. I
[2:22:35] want him to be the preeminent and one in
[2:22:37] my life.
[2:22:38] &gt;&gt; Lord, I lay aside everything. I lay down
[2:22:41] all all of my failures. I lay aside
[2:22:43] everything, all that I am, Lord. I lay
[2:22:45] it all down at your feet.
[2:22:47] &gt;&gt; Thank you, God.
[2:22:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:22:50] &gt;&gt; That's it. If you want to come, come on.
[2:22:52] Hallelujah. You need prayer right around
[2:22:54] here this morning.
[2:22:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:22:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're here to offer prayer.
[2:22:58] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, friends. This place, this
[2:23:00] building that God gave us, these bricks
[2:23:02] could have been used for anything. They
[2:23:04] could have been used for a dance hall.
[2:23:06] They could have been used for a
[2:23:07] courthouse. But God chose that these
[2:23:09] bricks came here and God would call a
[2:23:12] group of people inside of here. Oh, I
[2:23:14] know somebody else built this, another
[2:23:16] organization, but God gave it to us as a
[2:23:19] place that he would come down and meet
[2:23:21] with you and I and draw us back to
[2:23:23] himself in a complete relationship. God
[2:23:26] gave us these grounds. God gave us this
[2:23:28] building that our lives that we might
[2:23:30] come in fellowship with God and be
[2:23:32] living testimonies of the living God.
[2:23:36] Hallelujah.
[2:23:37] &gt;&gt; G.
[2:23:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:23:39] &gt;&gt; No wonder the devil has fought me so
[2:23:41] hard here this morning. Not here. Not
[2:23:43] here. Not in here. No wonder. All the
[2:23:45] way through. But I appreciate your
[2:23:47] prayers. God has breakthrough.
[2:23:51] You love him this morning.
[2:23:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh friends, you know I'm not
[2:23:56] working anything up. I'm put I'm just
[2:23:57] want to draw you to him. I want to draw
[2:24:00] you to him. May maybe you need to make a
[2:24:02] fresh consecration. Maybe you've got
[2:24:04] some things built up in your temple.
[2:24:06] Maybe there's some things that there. It
[2:24:07] may not be oxen. It may not be other
[2:24:09] things. But maybe there's some things
[2:24:10] that you got in your temple that the
[2:24:12] Lord is just revealing and saying, "Hey,
[2:24:13] wait a minute here. I want complete
[2:24:15] perfect worship. You've allowed
[2:24:17] business. You've allowed this. You've
[2:24:18] allowed this. You've allowed so many
[2:24:20] different things to get in there." But
[2:24:22] what is he doing? He's giving you the
[2:24:24] strength.
[2:24:26] &gt;&gt; It's not him coming through with the
[2:24:27] scourge.
[2:24:28] &gt;&gt; True. But as a king,
[2:24:31] &gt;&gt; a ruler, you're stepping forth like
[2:24:33] Nehemiah and saying, "Not going to go
[2:24:36] inside these walls."
[2:24:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:38] &gt;&gt; Not going to go in here. This is made
[2:24:40] for worship.
[2:24:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:24:42] &gt;&gt; Devil, my mind might be a no man's land,
[2:24:45] but it ain't meant for you.
[2:24:48] &gt;&gt; Them mind battles and everything else,
[2:24:50] it was meant for you.
[2:24:52] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to tell you, if it's a no
[2:24:53] man's land, then you know what that
[2:24:56] means? You got an opportunity to fill
[2:24:58] it. That's right.
[2:24:59] &gt;&gt; Praise God,
[2:25:00] &gt;&gt; brother Sam. I have to keep filling and
[2:25:01] keep filling it.
[2:25:02] &gt;&gt; There you go.
[2:25:03] &gt;&gt; It's like when you get things and all of
[2:25:05] a sudden you make a Goodwill run. What
[2:25:06] do you do? You bring more stuff in your
[2:25:08] house. Then you make another Goodwill
[2:25:10] run. Bring more stuff. I'm going tell
[2:25:11] you, that's what you got to do with your
[2:25:12] mind.
[2:25:14] &gt;&gt; Let your mind be filled with the things
[2:25:16] of God. Don't let the devil fill it.
[2:25:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:25:18] &gt;&gt; You fill it with the things of God.
[2:25:19] Amen.
[2:25:20] &gt;&gt; Don't just walk out of a good service
[2:25:22] and just walk out under a good
[2:25:24] anointing, but go walk out of there and
[2:25:25] say, "Lord, as a king, I have been
[2:25:28] instructed to keep this temple
[2:25:31] &gt;&gt; in working condition."
[2:25:35] &gt;&gt; As a priest under Melzdc.
[2:25:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That I'm not living for this
[2:25:41] life. I'm living
[2:25:42] &gt;&gt; for that life which is to come.
[2:25:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:25:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:25:46] &gt;&gt; Can we just sing that and sing that
[2:25:48] song? I love him because he first loved
[2:25:51] me.
[2:25:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:25:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:25:55] &gt;&gt; I
[2:25:58] love him.
[2:26:01] I
[2:26:04] love him
[2:26:08] because
[2:26:10] he first
[2:26:13] love me
[2:26:18] and purchase
[2:26:21] my
[2:26:23] salvation
[2:26:25] [Music]
[2:26:29] on
[2:26:35] tree.
[2:26:37] One more time. I
[2:26:41] love him.
[2:26:45] I
[2:26:48] love him
[2:26:51] because
[2:26:54] he first
[2:26:57] love me
[2:27:00] and purchase
[2:27:04] my
[2:27:06] salary.
[2:27:17] tree.
[2:27:20] Jesus
[2:27:21] is the sweetest
[2:27:24] name I know.
[2:27:30] And he's just the same
[2:27:35] [Music]
[2:27:36] as his lovely
[2:27:40] name.
[2:27:43] That's the reason why I love him so.
[2:27:53] Lord Jesus
[2:27:56] is the sweetest
[2:27:59] name I know. Paul, come up here and help
[2:28:03] me out, please. Jesus
[2:28:06] is the sweetest
[2:28:10] name I know.
[2:28:15] And he's just the same
[2:28:21] as his lovely
[2:28:24] name.
[2:28:26] [Music]
[2:28:27] That's the reason why I love him so.
[2:28:38] Lord Jesus
[2:28:41] is the sweetest
[2:28:44] name I know.
[2:28:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:28:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:28:52] &gt;&gt; I wonder if we just couldn't in this
[2:28:53] moment just just join in prayer together
[2:28:56] and then I want to pray for these needs
[2:28:58] and I want to pray if there's other
[2:29:00] others that would love prayer or like to
[2:29:02] have to have prayer here this morning. I
[2:29:04] want us just to pray for one another
[2:29:06] right now. Maybe you're sitting next to
[2:29:08] a brother or a sister or a brother to

[2:29:46] would come to my mind, I lay it down. I

[2:29:50] vessel, as a temple of the living God.

[2:30:40] in the garden when it was in the time of
[2:30:42] crisis in the time of adversity
[2:30:44] when the fall had taken place. But Lord
[2:30:47] God, you would not allow the conditions,
[2:30:48] Lord, to stop you cuz the conditions do
[2:30:51] not change that it's a son and daughter
[2:30:53] of God that's there underneath those
[2:30:55] fallen conditions. But Lord, you came to
[2:30:57] break the clouds back, Lord. And I pray,
[2:30:59] heavenly father, for my brother, Lord,
[2:31:01] that I have my hand on, Lord, for every
[2:31:03] one of these sisters, Lord, for every
[2:31:05] one of these young people, Lord. I pray,

[2:31:09] of God this morning, Lord, break back
[2:31:11] every cloud, Lord. Break back every
[2:31:13] hold, Lord. Every demon of oppression,
[2:31:15] Lord God. Every spirit of darkness,
[2:31:17] Lord. Every bit of gloom, Lord God. I
[2:31:20] pray, Father, every voice, Lord, of
[2:31:22] confusion, Lord, I pray in the name of
[2:31:24] Jesus Christ, Lord, the blood of Jesus
[2:31:27] Christ, rebuke that enemy, Lord God, and
[2:31:30] that hold, Lord, that would want to be
[2:31:31] placed and to hinder, Lord, that life,

[3:00:52] light. I want to thank you Jesus.
[3:00:59] You have saved
[3:01:01] my life.
[3:01:04] You brought me from the darkness
[3:01:08] into glorious
[3:01:11] light.
[3:01:14] Hallelujah.
[3:01:20] &gt;&gt; Don't you just love him? Amen.
[3:01:22] &gt;&gt; I know I probably asked you that 50
[3:01:24] times today.
[3:01:26] &gt;&gt; But you know what?
[3:01:28] &gt;&gt; You love him more, don't you? Now,
[3:01:31] &gt;&gt; but you know, he's never he's never
[3:01:33] increased his love for you. He's loved
[3:01:36] you the same all the time.
[3:01:39] &gt;&gt; We're just finding more and more about
[3:01:42] the love
[3:01:43] &gt;&gt; that he's had for us. Amen.
[3:01:47] &gt;&gt; Now, I want to say just in this moment,
[3:01:49] you know, you you know, you know how
[3:01:51] quick you know how quick it is to get
[3:01:54] back into fellowship with God. That's
[3:01:56] &gt;&gt; right.
[3:02:00] &gt;&gt; You hear brother Bam say
[3:02:02] &gt;&gt; they're in the prayer line.
[3:02:04] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[3:02:05] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now, if there's something in
[3:02:07] your life that's not right," he said,
[3:02:08] "be before you get up here," he said,
[3:02:10] "because the angel of the Lord will call
[3:02:12] that out." Yeah.
[3:02:13] &gt;&gt; You know why the angel of the Lord would
[3:02:14] call that out?
[3:02:16] &gt;&gt; Not to embarrass.
[3:02:18] &gt;&gt; But the angel of the Lord, the reason he
[3:02:20] would call out sin or anything is
[3:02:23] because what he's what he's announcing
[3:02:25] is that you don't have no right on my
[3:02:27] son or daughter.
[3:02:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[3:02:29] &gt;&gt; That's what it is. It's not a shame.
[3:02:31] It's not shaming.
[3:02:32] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit doesn't shame.
[3:02:34] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[3:02:35] &gt;&gt; Conviction. You know what conviction is?
[3:02:38] Is where you realize as a son and
[3:02:39] daughter of God, I don't have to live
[3:02:41] beneath this any longer. That's right.
[3:02:44] &gt;&gt; I don't have to I'm I'm living beneath
[3:02:45] my privileges.
[3:02:47] &gt;&gt; Brother said, "Here's what you do." He
[3:02:49] said, "Before you get up there,
[3:02:52] this is how much.
[3:02:54] Step out of line.
[3:02:57] Make it right from your heart and then
[3:02:59] get back in line."
[3:03:01] [Music]
[3:03:05] &gt;&gt; That's so good.
[3:03:06] &gt;&gt; You hear a voice that said, "Get back in
[3:03:08] step. You were out of step.
[3:03:11] &gt;&gt; Lord, forgive me.
[3:03:12] &gt;&gt; Get back in step.
[3:03:16] &gt;&gt; That's how quick
[3:03:18] &gt;&gt; fellowship
[3:03:19] &gt;&gt; is restored.
[3:03:22] &gt;&gt; That's how quick it's restored.
[3:03:25] &gt;&gt; And once it's repented of,
[3:03:29] &gt;&gt; it's gone.
[3:03:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[3:03:32] &gt;&gt; The enemy would want to bring it up,
[3:03:33] it's gone. Right?
[3:03:35] &gt;&gt; How many times, brother Ram, stand there
[3:03:36] in a meeting and you have individuals
[3:03:38] and they were wanting in their mind they
[3:03:40] wanted to come back. They wanted to come
[3:03:41] back and they were there were things in
[3:03:44] their life they were they were ashamed
[3:03:46] of, they were sorry for the Holy Spirit
[3:03:48] called him out and said, "By the way,
[3:03:49] you got sinus condition and the Lord
[3:03:51] just healed you. And by the way,
[3:03:52] brother, your sins are forgiven you."
[3:03:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:03:57] &gt;&gt; And brother Bram stopped multiple times.
[3:03:59] He stopped. He said, "Wait a minute.
[3:04:01] That wasn't what I said. But the same
[3:04:04] one who said that that sinus condition
[3:04:08] and you're healed is the same one who
[3:04:12] said your sins are forgiven you.
[3:04:16] &gt;&gt; Said to that person you've wanted to get
[3:04:18] to a place where you could put your foot
[3:04:20] back on. You've wanted to get to a place
[3:04:22] where you could come back home.
[3:04:26] &gt;&gt; How many times brother Brandham stood
[3:04:27] right there to that person and says,
[3:04:28] "You want to come back to God?" Yeah. He
[3:04:30] said, "You're back."
[3:04:34] [Music]
[3:04:35] &gt;&gt; Why?
[3:04:36] &gt;&gt; Why?
[3:04:38] &gt;&gt; It's your heart.
[3:04:40] &gt;&gt; The heart of God came down to be able to
[3:04:44] rescue our heart.
[3:04:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[3:04:47] &gt;&gt; And you are a people after God's own
[3:04:49] heart.
[3:04:51] &gt;&gt; You came from him. You're going back to
[3:04:54] him. All right.
[3:04:56] &gt;&gt; How many can say right now, I'm giving
[3:04:59] him my all.
[3:05:02] &gt;&gt; I'm giving him my all.
[3:05:04] &gt;&gt; You know what? This week, give him your
[3:05:06] confession.
[3:05:08] &gt;&gt; Just take just take those lips and say,
[3:05:10] you know what? These lips were not meant
[3:05:13] to speak negative things.
[3:05:16] &gt;&gt; I can't live this. I can't do this. But
[3:05:18] you go forward from here and saying, I
[3:05:20] am a daughter of God. I am a child of
[3:05:23] God. The Holy Ghost is mine. This is
[3:05:25] under my feet. Whatever it is, don't let
[3:05:27] that confession stop.
[3:05:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:05:31] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Samuel, what what are
[3:05:32] you talking about?" I'm talking about
[3:05:34] you taking the word of what God has
[3:05:36] spoken and you watch the word transform
[3:05:38] your life.
[3:05:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[3:05:41] &gt;&gt; This isn't mind over matter.
[3:05:43] &gt;&gt; This isn't positive thinking. It's a
[3:05:45] positive word from a positive God made
[3:05:48] positive by his presence that is coming
[3:05:50] to a people that says, "Amen. That's my
[3:05:53] promise.
[3:05:56] &gt;&gt; Did you want to try to take it away?
[3:05:58] Nope. I'm not going to take it away. You
[3:06:00] get up tomorrow morning and it feels
[3:06:02] like a Monday morning.
[3:06:06] &gt;&gt; Still mine anyhow.
[3:06:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[3:06:09] &gt;&gt; You know why? You're a king in that
[3:06:11] moment.
[3:06:11] &gt;&gt; And as a king, you're not going to
[3:06:14] infringe in this temple.
[3:06:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[3:06:16] &gt;&gt; Because I'm a priest and I'm going to
[3:06:18] worship.
[3:06:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:06:21] Hallelujah.
[3:06:23] &gt;&gt; You're kings and priests.
[3:06:28] &gt;&gt; The enemy said, "Well, you ain't much of
[3:06:29] a daughter of God." You know what a
[3:06:31] ruler says? Shut up.
[3:06:34] &gt;&gt; Shut up. I am what I am by the grace of
[3:06:37] God. I am what he said I am. Let the
[3:06:40] redeemed of the Lord say so.
[3:06:45] &gt;&gt; And as a ruler, you're standing there
[3:06:47] over that temple.
[3:06:49] You know the you know the they had
[3:06:51] guards in the temple.
[3:06:52] &gt;&gt; Lord
[3:06:53] &gt;&gt; and you know what them guards were for
[3:06:54] in the temple is to keep that temple
[3:06:56] from others coming in there and
[3:06:58] infringing in it.
[3:07:00] &gt;&gt; Why? So that the priest could do what
[3:07:02] they were called to do.
[3:07:03] &gt;&gt; And you are a king and a priest. You've
[3:07:06] been authorized as a son and daughter of
[3:07:08] God to tell the devil. If the devil is
[3:07:10] anywhere in your life out from under
[3:07:12] your foot, he's out of his place. Amen.
[3:07:18] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[3:07:21] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm through preaching. I'm just
[3:07:22] exhorting.
[3:07:23] [Music]
[3:07:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:07:27] &gt;&gt; I tell you friends, pin the devil right
[3:07:30] in and just wedge him in. Don't let go.
[3:07:32] Your victory. Listen, your victory.
[3:07:34] Don't let don't release it. But let that
[3:07:36] victory take it into your bosom.
[3:07:39] &gt;&gt; Take it into your life. No matter what
[3:07:41] the need might be here this morning,
[3:07:42] take it in. Just surrender it all.
[3:07:44] Surrender all your thoughts. Surrender
[3:07:45] all the negativity and let the Holy
[3:07:47] Spirit come in and do what he desires to
[3:07:50] do in your life.
[3:07:52] &gt;&gt; And then watch his transforming power in
[3:07:56] your life.
[3:07:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:07:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:07:59] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[3:08:01] &gt;&gt; We stand on that.
[3:08:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:08:03] &gt;&gt; We'll say right now, amen.
[3:08:05] &gt;&gt; And we're right in his presence. And the
[3:08:07] prophet said, there's no higher court of
[3:08:10] appeal than the presence of God. Yeah.
[3:08:14] &gt;&gt; When God has said, when God has spoken,
[3:08:16] let every other voice keep silent.
[3:08:20] &gt;&gt; God is in his holy temple.
[3:08:23] &gt;&gt; You love him this morning.
[3:08:25] &gt;&gt; That's 51 times.
[3:08:27] &gt;&gt; Jubilee plus one.
[3:08:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:08:32] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. He said, "Preach." Here
[3:08:34] we go now.
[3:08:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:08:39] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[3:08:42] Hallelujah. It's all because of the lamb
[3:08:44] of God. This liberty we have, not just
[3:08:48] in here, but that liberty. Why? Your
[3:08:50] worship, your worship is based on the
[3:08:52] liberty that he's brought in your life.
[3:08:55] &gt;&gt; Nobody can worship him like you can.
[3:08:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. To whom much has been
[3:09:01] forgiven.
[3:09:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:09:05] [Music]
[3:09:07] &gt;&gt; And he forgave me of much.
[3:09:09] &gt;&gt; Hey, he forgave you of much, too. I
[3:09:11] don't care if you were a Sunday school
[3:09:13] person. He forgave you of a lot, too. He
[3:09:15] forgave you of your old nature.
[3:09:17] &gt;&gt; Being proud that you had more stars than
[3:09:19] everybody else in Sunday school. He
[3:09:20] forgave you of that. He came down and
[3:09:22] touched our lives.
[3:09:26] &gt;&gt; My my my I said, "Praise be to God."
[3:09:30] &gt;&gt; I say, "Worthy is the lamb."
[3:09:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's worthy.
[3:09:36] He's above every demon. He's above every
[3:09:39] habit. He's above every situation. He is
[3:09:42] the Lord of glory. His name is above
[3:09:44] every other name. I don't care what
[3:09:47] disease it is. His name's above it.
[3:09:51] &gt;&gt; I don't care what family stream it is.
[3:09:53] His name's above it.
[3:09:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:09:58] [Music]
[3:10:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:10:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:10:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:10:08] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[3:10:10] My past is clear. My future's clear.
[3:10:15] Sister Dalton, I was going to display
[3:10:17] this today. I could send it out on our
[3:10:20] thread and in the email. Sister Dalton
[3:10:22] had a question. Brother Brandham, I was
[3:10:24] born illegitimately.
[3:10:27] So, they brought the question in the den
[3:10:29] room. I've got the handwritten letter
[3:10:30] right here.
[3:10:32] Brother Brandham, he went through it.
[3:10:34] You heard him say it in the message,
[3:10:35] too. He said, 'W what it is is not one
[3:10:37] of them could enter into the
[3:10:38] congregation of God for how many
[3:10:40] generations? He said what it was? It was
[3:10:42] the blood of bulls and goats. There
[3:10:43] wasn't a blood strong enough
[3:10:46] &gt;&gt; that could take care of that.
[3:10:49] &gt;&gt; And in this letter, I'll send it out to
[3:10:50] you here this week. In this letter,
[3:10:52] Brother Brandon writes on the bottom of
[3:10:53] it,
[3:10:55] he says, "Sister Dalton,
[3:10:58] don't let this trouble you no more."
[3:11:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[3:11:01] &gt;&gt; The new birth
[3:11:03] &gt;&gt; corrects it all.
[3:11:05] Hallelujah.
[3:11:06] [Applause]
[3:11:08] &gt;&gt; There's a blood.
[3:11:10] &gt;&gt; It's strong enough.
[3:11:13] &gt;&gt; It's strong enough to break every hold.
[3:11:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:11:17] &gt;&gt; When you apply the blood to your life,
[3:11:18] it's strong enough to break every hold.
[3:11:20] There might be stains that Clorox can't
[3:11:22] get out of your clothes, but the blood
[3:11:24] of Jesus Christ, it can loosen every
[3:11:26] hold.
[3:11:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:11:28] &gt;&gt; And you know what it does? It sends it
[3:11:29] right back on the accuser
[3:11:32] &gt;&gt; who's responsible for it in the first
[3:11:33] place. He's got a lot to answer for.
[3:11:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:11:39] &gt;&gt; But I'm free.
[3:11:41] &gt;&gt; We're free.
[3:11:42] &gt;&gt; Are you free today?
[3:11:44] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[3:11:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:11:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. I I'm so happy.
[3:11:50] &gt;&gt; I I don't know what I I don't know. I
[3:11:52] feel like running or cartwheeling. I I'm
[3:11:54] just so happy right now. You say,
[3:11:55] "Brother Samuel, why?" Because of what
[3:11:57] he's done in my life. I know where I'm
[3:12:00] standing. You know where you're
[3:12:02] standing. There's a flag that's strong
[3:12:04] enough.
[3:12:05] [Music]
[3:12:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:12:10] &gt;&gt; Your loved one,
[3:12:13] lift them right now before God.
[3:12:15] &gt;&gt; Say, "Lord, you know right where they're
[3:12:16] at."
[3:12:17] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Hallelujah.
[3:12:18] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, I walk up and down here
[3:12:20] praying for different ones, loved ones,
[3:12:22] young people
[3:12:24] sitting right here. I call their name
[3:12:25] out.
[3:12:28] &gt;&gt; You know what? I know the enemy can hear
[3:12:30] it in another dimension. And I let him
[3:12:32] know, you got to take your hands off of
[3:12:34] them.
[3:12:35] &gt;&gt; They're coming home. I don't care what
[3:12:37] kind of condition they're in.
[3:12:39] &gt;&gt; God, give the parents strength. Let them
[3:12:41] give them fortitude. I know the enemy
[3:12:43] try to trouble their mind. Give them
[3:12:44] strength, Lord. And Satan, take your
[3:12:46] dirty hands off of them.
[3:12:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:12:48] &gt;&gt; That's my sister. That's my brother.
[3:12:50] They're God's children. They're his
[3:12:52] daughter. They're his son.
[3:12:55] &gt;&gt; I believe that. Don't you?
[3:12:57] &gt;&gt; We're witnesses of that.
[3:13:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're expecting.
[3:13:02] &gt;&gt; We're expecting it.
[3:13:04] &gt;&gt; My my my Turn around. Just shake hands
[3:13:07] with somebody. Say, just let him know
[3:13:09] how much you love him.
[3:13:12] &gt;&gt; I'm going to have to pass this off.
[3:13:16] God bless you.
[3:13:17] [Music]
[3:13:33] Well, once like a bird in prison I
[3:13:38] dwell. No freedom from my sorrow I fell.
[3:13:44] Well then Jesus came and he listened
[3:13:47] unto me. Oh well glory be to God. Oh he
