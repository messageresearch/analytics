[40:42] um we're believers. Amen.
[40:45] &gt;&gt; And uh so brother Ram as he told us he
[40:47] said if you're a believer then there's
[40:49] nothing impossible with you.
[40:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because because of him nothing

[41:06] week it is, he's still the same God.
[41:08] &gt;&gt; We we don't come to church differently
[41:10] on Thursday than we do on Sunday. God is
[41:13] the same God at all times. Amen. And we
[41:16] so appreciate that. So enjoyed the songs
[41:19] and um so we just want to turn our
[41:22] hearts here just in this further part of
[41:24] the service just right into the word of
[41:27] the [music] Lord. So let's just go to
[41:28] him in a word of prayer and then we'll
[41:30] get right into the word tonight.
[41:33] Heavenly Father,
[41:35] how thankful we are for your mercies,
[41:37] Lord, once again this day.
[41:41] Lord, we have truly so much to be
[41:43] thankful for,
[41:46] dear God, for all that you have done for
[41:49] us. And most importantly, Lord, when we
[41:52] think of that, yes, there's been a lot
[41:57] ways that Lord, that you have provided,
[42:00] not only physically,
[42:02] oh God, in touching us, strengthening
[42:05] our bodies, but
[42:07] how we are so thankful that God, that
[42:10] you brought us to yourself.
[42:13] We're thankful that you found us, Lord,
[42:16] because Father, it's through that, Lord,
[42:19] that there's a real strength that comes
[42:22] into our hearts. It's a confidence,
[42:26] Lord, that is not produced by anything
[42:30] that we have done, but it's the grace of
[42:33] God.
[42:34] Lord, I pray tonight that you would just
[42:38] come by our way, Lord, once again, Lord,
[42:41] as we're gathered here, Father, to come
[42:43] to hear from you. That's what we want to
[42:46] hear from Lord. We want to hear from
[42:48] you. We ask that you would speak to our
[42:50] hearts, Lord, through your word. For all
[42:53] the different needs, Lord, that have
[42:55] been read, spoken and unspoken. Father,
[42:58] we just commit it all into your hands.
[43:01] We ask oh God that knowing that there
[43:04] are many needs Lord that's among us
[43:06] needs upon our hearts and we commit
[43:08] every one of them into your hands Lord
[43:11] we thank you for your mercy Lord
[43:14] we ask that God you'll just come and
[43:17] just take your word and speak to our
[43:19] hearts Lord and just commit myself Lord
[43:22] to you and this congregation and may you
[43:25] just have your way we pray in Jesus
[43:28] precious name amen Amen. Amen. God bless
[43:32] you. And
[43:34] let's go right into the [clears throat]
[43:36] scriptures here tonight. And I want to
[43:39] just move into this portion of
[43:41] scripture.
[43:43] Amen. And uh [clears throat]
[43:46] look at a little bit of where we were uh
[43:48] last week. And
[43:59] Amen. So good to see each and every one
[44:01] of you. And um [clears throat]
[44:05] Brother Brian had already mentioned that
[44:08] with where things will change, but I had
[44:10] looked at it here just to even a little
[44:12] bit ago that as far as where the ice and
[44:15] so forth. For those of you that'll be
[44:17] driving to early in the morning, I think
[44:20] at about 5 and 6 in the morning is when
[44:22] that is supposed to drop. The
[44:24] temperatures very very quickly. So, it's
[44:26] just going to continue to go down, but
[44:28] we're good here. [laughter]
[44:30] And so, I know maybe some of the the
[44:33] kids are thinking, man, you know, don't
[44:35] do a rain dance for for ice. You do you
[44:37] do an ice dance, you know, but uh but so
[44:41] just uh we just want to pray. And I I
[44:44] was saying, you know, I trust that
[44:45] there's enough salt that's been down on
[44:46] the road. And I know some places I've
[44:48] been, I've walked more on salt than I
[44:50] have on the concrete. And so we just
[44:53] trust the Lord and just just ask each
[44:55] and everyone just be careful there in
[44:57] the morning and the Lord will just watch
[44:59] over us. So that doesn't mean I'm going
[45:02] to keep you tonight.
[45:04] [laughter]
[45:07] So let's read here verse 14. Amen. In
[45:11] first John, we have seen and do testify
[45:16] that the father sent the son to be the
[45:20] savior of the world. And whosoever shall
[45:23] confess that Jesus is the son of God,
[45:27] God dwelleth in him, and he in God. And
[45:32] we have known and believed the love that
[45:35] God hath to us.
[45:38] God is love, and he that dwelleth in
[45:41] love dwelleth in God, and God in him.
[45:46] And herein is our love
[45:50] made perfect that we may have boldness
[45:53] or confidence in the day of judgment.
[45:57] Because as he is, so are we in this
[46:01] world. There is no fear in love, but
[46:04] perfect love casteth out fear, because
[46:09] fear hath torment, and he that fearth is
[46:13] not made perfect in love, and we love
[46:16] him because he first loved us. Amen. May
[46:22] God bless you. Bless the reading of the
[46:24] word as it's being seated.
[46:26] [clears throat]
[46:28] I want to just continue to pick up this
[46:31] uh thought here just for a few moments
[46:35] tonight and moving forward. Um and when
[46:39] we are looking [clears throat] here in
[46:41] these scriptures that we have read
[46:44] in our text to see how that John would
[46:48] write of it and maybe I'll just pull it
[46:50] back up. We have seen and do testify.
[46:54] This this word seen is the uh same word
[46:58] that would be used where John would say
[47:01] we have known and believe. So it's what
[47:04] God has revealed
[47:06] to them. And this is where John is able
[47:08] to write with such an assurance and such
[47:11] a confidence because not only to be able
[47:14] to perceive what God has done and that
[47:17] to be revealed but then to believe that.
[47:20] And the only way we can really believe
[47:22] it and it becomes something that is real
[47:24] personal is when God would reveal this
[47:28] personally to our hearts that what he
[47:30] has done for us in that becoming our
[47:34] redeemer and our savior. And so when we
[47:38] look at this, this is the whole uh
[47:41] objective of the gospel of Jesus Christ
[47:44] is to bring that revelation. The very
[47:47] first opening scripture in the book of
[47:49] revelation is the revelation of Jesus
[47:52] Christ. This is the whole goal of what
[47:55] God is to bring to the heart and life of
[47:58] the believer. And then through that
[48:00] revelation taking hold within a person's
[48:03] heart, it will bring about an absolute
[48:06] change within their life. And it will
[48:08] create a faith that will actually reach
[48:11] to govern circumstances in their life
[48:14] that can come up. It will also be
[48:17] through that revelation where there will
[48:19] be a continual unfolding then of the
[48:21] very character and the nature of Christ
[48:24] becoming more and more one with him. And
[48:28] so when we're looking at this, God's
[48:30] desire within our hearts is that we
[48:32] would stand with confidence. God does
[48:35] not want us to be unsettled in our walk
[48:37] or in our in where we are with him. God
[48:40] always is interested in that bringing
[48:43] that of stability and where that we
[48:45] would be in our walk. There's always
[48:47] that place to where we can actually know
[48:50] where we're standing with God. And so I
[48:54] want to just kind of come back into this
[48:56] here just a moment and read this
[48:58] particular quote that we have read here
[49:00] a few different times. And brother Bham
[49:03] says it like this. He says, "We we know
[49:05] that drinking and carrying on is sin,
[49:07] but the whole thing is because of
[49:10] unbelief because if you believe God and
[49:13] Jesus Christ to be his son, you are
[49:15] absolutely not going to do those things.
[49:18] He that's born of God does not commit
[49:21] sin or a practitioner of it. You must
[49:26] believe and the whole thing lays in
[49:29] faith. He that heareth my words and
[49:31] believeth on him that sent me has
[49:33] everlasting life and shall not come into
[49:36] condemnation, but already passed from
[49:38] death into life. And brother Bram says,
[49:41] you believe that to be the truth, there
[49:43] it lays. There isn't nothing else you
[49:46] can do but only believe.
[49:49] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; And if you believe, then them little
[49:53] immoral things will just drop off like
[49:57] that. As you believe, you become love
[50:01] &gt;&gt; and love is God. And you begin to wind
[50:04] yourself into Christ. And then and then
[50:07] these other things, you don't have to
[50:09] quit doing them. They just quit
[50:12] themselves because how why would that
[50:15] be? The lifeline to them or the desire,
[50:18] the appetite is cut off.
[50:21] So if there is no more desire for it,
[50:24] then it will not no longer be there. And
[50:28] so then the the simplicity, you don't
[50:30] have to quit doing them. They'll just
[50:32] quit themselves. There's just no desire
[50:35] to do it because the worshipper having
[50:37] purged has no more conscience or desire
[50:40] of sin. And so when we look at this this
[50:43] real purging and the cleansing that
[50:46] comes in our heart and we can see what
[50:49] God has done within our life to be able
[50:52] to actually catch a hold of the love of
[50:54] God and be able to see, you know, many
[50:57] can look and even when it starts in our
[50:59] life to begin to see how that God would
[51:02] come down and through that of salvation
[51:05] that God had become our savior. But then
[51:08] to see that it was more than just uh
[51:11] knowing and accepting him in the in the
[51:13] in that of Lord forgive me of my sins
[51:16] and to know that but then that it would
[51:18] come into the depth of what his coming
[51:20] was about in order to produce a
[51:23] sanctified life, a separated life to
[51:25] where it would bring about a
[51:27] relationship. And I I understand that
[51:30] there's things that when even as a
[51:32] person would come to serve the Lord,
[51:34] there's a lot of things you want to know
[51:36] and things of Lord I I don't want to do
[51:38] this or I don't want to do that. I don't
[51:40] want to do anything that would displease
[51:42] him. And that that's something that
[51:43] never it never departs from your life.
[51:46] It's something that would continue on.
[51:48] And it it moves into a place. So let me
[51:50] explain it to you like this. It moves
[51:52] into a place within your life to where
[51:54] that everything you begin to find the
[51:58] evaluating decisions you'll make based
[52:00] on how will this affect my walk with
[52:03] God. How will it bring influence? So it
[52:06] will it becomes to a question to where
[52:08] that it's not so much is this right or
[52:11] is this wrong. You begin to live your
[52:13] life based on how will this affect or
[52:16] take up my time or take up my walk. How
[52:19] will it affect my walk with God? This is
[52:21] where the deepening of the love of God
[52:23] within our life that you can see that I
[52:26] just he said my life just he said you
[52:28] just get so full of God it just pushed
[52:30] all those other things out
[52:31] &gt;&gt; and you see it wasn't something that
[52:33] anybody told him uh you know you can't
[52:36] ride your motorcycle because there's
[52:37] nothing wrong there's nothing wrong
[52:38] against it then your life begins to be
[52:41] weighed on it's really living a life
[52:43] that's pleasing unto the Lord so once
[52:46] the Holy Spirit has come then your life
[52:48] comes into that channel of how that I
[52:50] might be able to please him and to serve
[52:53] him better. And so, you know, when
[52:56] brother Brandham would would take this
[52:58] over and over, you're familiar through
[52:59] the message that, you know, God's desire
[53:02] and through the scriptures is not that
[53:04] we would u serve him under a slaveike
[53:07] mentality. And I realized that sometimes
[53:09] that even as I said when God first gets
[53:12] a hold of a life and sometimes it can be
[53:14] from what we've come out from under
[53:16] maybe previous teaching or other things
[53:18] and sometimes it's not even that it's
[53:20] just our own perception and we come into
[53:23] a place and it's like that we are are
[53:25] living our lives as though that it's at
[53:28] any moment that oh if if I do something
[53:31] or if I do this and and and and
[53:33] everything is then it's just under a
[53:36] slaveike mentality. ity. Now, let me
[53:38] just say this to you. You can be a
[53:40] fullyborn son of God and still have a
[53:44] slaveike mentality.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; And that's one of the objectives that
[53:50] God wants to clean that out because that
[53:52] can never bring about in our life what
[53:55] God would lead us to. Because slaveike
[53:59] mentality is based on if I do this, I
[54:02] feel like this. If I do this, then God
[54:04] loves me. You can never change God's
[54:07] love for you.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; You know, you or I, our love will grow.
[54:12] That's true. And our love grows is the
[54:14] more that we'll believe him, the more
[54:16] that the love that the love of God will
[54:19] move within our hearts. But in reality,
[54:21] it's not that God loves you anymore now
[54:25] tonight where you're sitting than he did
[54:27] when you was so far out in the world.
[54:29] The love of God was the same because his
[54:32] love goes clear back before there was
[54:34] Adam, stardust or molecule. And it was
[54:38] his love that led him even in the mind
[54:41] of God to where that he would make a
[54:43] propituation before there was any atom
[54:46] stardust molecule before there was ever
[54:49] any angels before the devil became the
[54:52] devil and led the others astray. God
[54:54] always loved you. And the degree that he
[54:58] loved you was so that he would a would
[55:00] absolutely or it would be displayed that
[55:03] he would absolutely make a way for you
[55:07] and that God would bring it about so
[55:09] that you and I might come back to a full
[55:12] relationship with almighty God. So you
[55:16] know there's a lot of things and I
[55:17] realize there's times and we go through
[55:20] and I'm not saying that we would not
[55:22] focus on our walk with God. I believe
[55:24] you begin to see the value of things
[55:27] within your life. You begin to see the
[55:29] value in your walk with God of
[55:31] overcoming your flesh and putting your
[55:34] flesh in subjection. So just in case you
[55:37] haven't known it that even when the Holy
[55:39] Spirit comes, the flesh man is never
[55:41] going to reach over into the soul man
[55:43] and shake hands and say, "We're
[55:45] buddies."
[55:46] &gt;&gt; It'll never. The prophet said, "It's a
[55:48] constant war until the day you're set
[55:51] free." This flesh don't like to pray.
[55:53] The flesh don't like to go to church.
[55:55] Flesh don't like to read. As a matter of
[55:57] fact, you have to tell your flesh even
[55:59] in times when you don't feel like
[56:02] listening to a message. You don't feel
[56:04] like praying. And you come to a place to
[56:06] realize press beyond that feeling. It's
[56:09] a barrier and to press beyond that. And
[56:12] you you understand you many of us have
[56:14] been serving the Lord long enough that
[56:16] you realize in pressing beyond that, you
[56:18] don't let that barrier stand there to
[56:20] define you. whether or not you are a
[56:22] Christian or a believer or not. You
[56:25] begin to recognize and begin to discern
[56:27] the tactics of the enemy and to
[56:29] understand that there's feelings that
[56:31] will always be there. But that's not
[56:33] what you live your life by is your
[56:35] feelings because you're going to have
[56:37] good feeling days, you're going to have
[56:38] bad feeling days. But remember, the love
[56:41] of God never changes. It never
[56:44] fluctuates based on the stock market. It
[56:47] don't change anything about you. As a
[56:49] matter of fact, even though like the
[56:51] prophet said, you would go astray, he
[56:53] still stands right there to welcome you
[56:55] back.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; My So if we can just God help us to
[57:02] even, you know, even here tonight with
[57:04] every one of us that that love would so
[57:07] deepen in our hearts for what God has
[57:10] already done for us. Because this quote
[57:12] that I just read to you, it is not about
[57:14] anything that God has to do for us. It's
[57:18] about us accepting what God has already
[57:21] done for us. I I pray that God will help
[57:24] it to be so real and make it so real to
[57:27] each of our hearts to where brother
[57:29] Brown would use this over and over
[57:30] about, you know, himself going overseas.
[57:33] And he says, "What if every time that I
[57:36] set before I went to go overseas, we
[57:38] were going to be separated and, you
[57:40] know, Sister Mey set him down. I'll tell
[57:42] you what, Bill, if you ever even flirt
[57:44] with with another woman or you do this
[57:47] or if I I'll tell you what, I you will
[57:49] find your bags on the doorstep when you
[57:52] get home. And then Brother Bram says,
[57:53] "Well, let me tell you something." And
[57:55] brother Bram says, "What kind of a home
[57:58] &gt;&gt; right
[57:59] &gt;&gt; would that be?"
[58:02] But you so brother Rammy as he goes into
[58:04] that and he says now he says she'll
[58:06] never she'll never it that will be not
[58:09] something that would ever happen if I if
[58:12] I love her like that what way what way
[58:15] that I would love her like that that I
[58:17] would would even though that she might
[58:19] forgive me uh I could get by with that
[58:22] she would forgive me but I would not
[58:24] want to do that to hurt her
[58:28] &gt;&gt; and so brother Brown would say this he
[58:30] would he would apply this principle that
[58:33] you and I might be able to relate to
[58:35] this to be able to see that though God
[58:38] could give a person and say you know
[58:40] what if you want to go smoke go smoke if
[58:42] you want to drink go drink if God would
[58:45] say something like that to you or me
[58:47] that would literally scare me to death
[58:50] &gt;&gt; what do you see in me Lord that you
[58:52] would think I want permission to do that
[58:55] &gt;&gt; I don't want to do anything like that
[58:57] that those things the desire have been
[58:59] taken from my life. And so, it's not
[59:02] that we're not doing those other things.
[59:04] It's not, oh, I'm dressing this way cuz
[59:07] if I don't dress right, then sure is the
[59:09] world, Brother Samuel's going to blast
[59:11] it. And if I don't if I if I do this and
[59:14] then so and so is going to say this. You
[59:15] you're living beneath your privileges.
[59:18] You need to understand what the love of
[59:20] God has done for you that it's so far
[59:23] greater than any pleasure that you can
[59:26] have in life. It will bring you such
[59:28] satisfaction. As a matter of fact, it
[59:31] will bring you THE ULTIMATE ACCEPTANCE
[59:34] THAT NO MATTER IF YOU NO MATTER HOW MANY
[59:36] LIKES or dislikes on Facebook or
[59:38] whatever more, you will have the
[59:40] ultimate acceptance when that revelation
[59:43] of Jesus Christ has broke into your
[59:46] heart. Sin flees from your life.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; This is why brother Brown when he would
[59:53] say that my heart, he says, I don't
[59:55] believe my heart would let me do it. Now
[59:56] watch how he goes on right after making
[59:59] those statements. He says, "When I look
[1:00:01] at my Lord and see he died yonder on
[1:00:04] Calvary, the lovely for me, the unloly,
[1:00:08] he, the pure for me, the impure to save
[1:00:13] me from a death of sin and an eternity
[1:00:15] in hell. Something in me, if I could get
[1:00:18] by with it, I don't want to do it. I
[1:00:21] love him." He said, "Yes, sir. I love
[1:00:24] him. Even if I thought if I'd go do it
[1:00:27] and he'd forgive me. I don't want to do
[1:00:28] it anyhow. I don't want to do nothing to
[1:00:31] hurt him. I love him too much. That's
[1:00:34] what we have to have. It's something in
[1:00:38] your heart love.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, it it don't condemn me to smoke. You
[1:00:42] know, I I drink a little. I Well,
[1:00:44] brother, you don't love him. Something's
[1:00:47] happened if you really love him.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said, "I used to have a
[1:00:52] person in the Baptist church." He goes
[1:00:54] on in this quote. They said, "This
[1:00:56] person would constantly ask me," Brother
[1:00:57] Brandham, do you think it's wrong to
[1:00:59] smoke? Do you think it's wrong to drink?
[1:01:02] And Brother Brham says, "You know, I
[1:01:03] wrote this little answer in my Bible."
[1:01:06] And in this answer or response to it,
[1:01:08] Brother Bram said, I wrote, "Don't ask
[1:01:10] me foolish questions. Make this up in
[1:01:14] your mind. If you love the Lord with all
[1:01:16] your heart, you won't smoke, chew, drink
[1:01:19] any shine." He said, "That still holds
[1:01:22] good tonight. So you see it what matters
[1:01:25] is where is the depth of God's love in
[1:01:29] your life.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; See remember the prophet tells us he'll
[1:01:33] say the altar is in your heart. Then
[1:01:34] he'll say the altar is in your mind.
[1:01:36] It's not conflicting because as the man
[1:01:39] thinkketh in his heart so is he. And so
[1:01:41] God will meet you right there. And a
[1:01:43] person can absolutely catch a hold of
[1:01:46] the love of God and repent of their sins
[1:01:50] and yet still have the same desires in
[1:01:52] their life that they always had. What
[1:01:54] what is the need? It's for the love of
[1:01:56] God to go deeper in their life and for
[1:01:59] them to go deeper in God's love. You
[1:02:02] see, the only way that that will come is
[1:02:05] is really submitting ourselves to the
[1:02:07] Lord and saying, "God, make it more real
[1:02:10] to me. make it more sure TO ME BECAUSE
[1:02:12] FLESH AND BLOOD ain't going to give it
[1:02:13] to us. It ain't going to be something
[1:02:15] that's taught into us or schooled in us.
[1:02:17] As a matter of fact, the prophet said in
[1:02:19] Satan's Eden, your new birth is not
[1:02:21] schooled in you or taught in you. It's
[1:02:23] predestinated from the hand of God from
[1:02:26] before the foundation of the world. So
[1:02:28] God knows the very moment and the time.
[1:02:30] God's not taken back by it and said,
[1:02:32] "Oh, let me get a picture here cuz I
[1:02:33] didn't know it was going to happen here.
[1:02:35] I didn't know it was going to happen
[1:02:36] like that." As a matter of fact, within
[1:02:38] even and many lives, God has to bring
[1:02:40] the realization to your heart of even
[1:02:43] what has already taken place in your
[1:02:45] life when the desire of the world has
[1:02:48] fled from your heart. So if you love or
[1:02:50] a person still loves the world, it's
[1:02:53] just not went deep enough yet. But the
[1:02:55] reality is as we will believe, we become
[1:03:00] love.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; And so what does that do? Well, you
[1:03:03] know, it'll actually produce a
[1:03:05] confidence and a trust in our life as we
[1:03:09] walk. It will actually produce that
[1:03:12] trust. Love will a faith that when we
[1:03:15] walk and no matter what circumstances,
[1:03:18] no matter what situations arise, there's
[1:03:21] a love that holds steady in the midst of
[1:03:24] it all. And that is the love of God that
[1:03:27] has been placed in our hearts. Now I
[1:03:29] want you to look here in the scripture
[1:03:31] of Ephesians 3. And Paul would write it
[1:03:34] in this way and say, "I desire that you
[1:03:37] faint not at my tribulations for you
[1:03:40] which is your glory. For this cause I
[1:03:43] bow my knees unto the father of our Lord
[1:03:46] Jesus Christ, of whom the whole family
[1:03:48] in heaven and earth is named, and that
[1:03:51] he would grant you according to the
[1:03:53] riches of his glory to be strengthened
[1:03:56] with might by his spirit in the inner
[1:03:59] man, that Christ may dwell in your
[1:04:02] hearts by faith, that ye being rooted
[1:04:06] and grounded in love.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; So notice how Paul writes this. his his
[1:04:12] prayer is that the the children of God
[1:04:15] would absolutely come to know the depth
[1:04:18] of God's love that that that Christ
[1:04:21] would dwell in our hearts by faith being
[1:04:25] rooted and grounded in love may be able
[1:04:28] to comprehend with all saints what is
[1:04:31] the breadth length depth and height and
[1:04:35] to know the love of Christ which passeth
[1:04:38] knowledge that you might be filled
[1:04:41] filled with all the fullness of God. Now
[1:04:44] unto him that is able to do exceeding
[1:04:47] abundantly above all that we ask or
[1:04:50] think according to the power that
[1:04:52] workketh in us. Unto him be glory in the
[1:04:55] church by Christ Jesus throughout all
[1:04:58] ages world without end. Amen. Now this
[1:05:02] last part of it unto him that is able.
[1:05:05] All of this is is that reality that what
[1:05:08] the re what the being rooted and
[1:05:11] grounded in the love of God and that
[1:05:13] that in itself will lead to a faith
[1:05:15] dwelling in our hearts then as we
[1:05:18] approach the circumstances and
[1:05:21] conditions of life and no matter what it
[1:05:23] is maybe you're praying for a loved one
[1:05:25] maybe there's situations at home maybe
[1:05:27] there's a financial need maybe there's a
[1:05:30] lot of things even when we look even
[1:05:32] into our own lives and know that God's
[1:05:34] desire is is a deepening of his own life
[1:05:38] within us. In other words, that our life
[1:05:41] is lived day by day to be conformed to
[1:05:44] the image of almighty God. So, and so in
[1:05:47] that in that regards when God gave us
[1:05:49] the new birth, he didn't just all of a
[1:05:51] sudden say, "You're done with patience,
[1:05:53] boy. You're patient. You're ready to
[1:05:55] go." No. The new birth puts us into the
[1:05:58] place to start to grow up into him in
[1:06:01] all things. Is there a measure of
[1:06:03] patience? Yes. Is there a measure of
[1:06:05] faith? Yes. Knowledge? Yes. Virtue? Yes.
[1:06:07] All of those things in a very small
[1:06:09] measure. But within that, it now comes
[1:06:13] into the place to where we would become
[1:06:15] more and more into his own image. And
[1:06:18] God will only actually bring us and lead
[1:06:21] us into those places as he would reveal
[1:06:24] it. And we can actually see and submit
[1:06:27] and surrender our lives. You say, "How
[1:06:29] long will that go on?" Until we're
[1:06:30] changed.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. until we're changed. And when
[1:06:34] we're changed, remember when whether it
[1:06:37] we passed and go before or by the way of
[1:06:39] the grave or it is at the consummation
[1:06:42] of the rapture. To me, it's a great
[1:06:43] miracle of how that the character itself
[1:06:47] what God has so placed within everyone
[1:06:50] of the hearts of the believer has come
[1:06:52] to the perfection of what God has called
[1:06:55] for even within that stature of a
[1:06:57] perfect man. That in itself is
[1:06:59] absolutely I mean to see how God is
[1:07:02] working and bringing us all into that
[1:07:04] place of to become more and more like
[1:07:07] him. And who doesn't want to be more
[1:07:09] like him? That's what real love does. I
[1:07:12] want to be more like him. And it isn't
[1:07:14] so much becoming more like him in great
[1:07:16] big things. It's in the little things.
[1:07:19] It's in each one of these aspects of our
[1:07:21] life. But what will actually lead and
[1:07:24] bring those things about in our life?
[1:07:25] Well, first of all, there's got to be a
[1:07:27] love there because if there's not a love
[1:07:29] there, then he's not going to be able to
[1:07:31] talk to us and really speak to us in
[1:07:33] that way and call for a greater depth.
[1:07:35] As our husband of faith, of knowledge,
[1:07:38] of virtue, of temperance, but as our
[1:07:40] husband, when the word will come forth,
[1:07:43] we recognize the word has not come to
[1:07:45] destroy us. It's not come to condemn us,
[1:07:48] but the word has come to bring to light
[1:07:51] little areas that maybe were not brought
[1:07:53] to light before, but as we're walking in
[1:07:56] the light and not only walking in it,
[1:07:58] BUT OUR LIVES BECOME FILLED with more of
[1:08:01] that divine light and as the love of God
[1:08:04] taking over IN OUR LIFE, LITTLE things
[1:08:06] that were little things before, now they
[1:08:09] stand out in a greater way. What's doing
[1:08:11] that in our life? It's the love of God.
[1:08:14] When you read in Ephesians 5, that love
[1:08:16] that of a husband that would have for
[1:08:18] his wife, like the love that the Lord
[1:08:20] Jesus has for us, it is a sanctifying
[1:08:23] love. Not a not a put down, not a
[1:08:25] condemning. It's a love that is
[1:08:27] cleansing and it's looking to raise us
[1:08:29] up. Not raise back raise up that first
[1:08:31] birth, but raise up that attribute that
[1:08:34] he came to redeem that that would come
[1:08:37] back fully into the expression of all
[1:08:40] that God has called for. And it's a
[1:08:43] confidence within our lives because
[1:08:45] there's many things that God will
[1:08:47] actually would ask of us and we could
[1:08:49] look and say, "Lord, you sure you got
[1:08:51] the right guy? Lord, how how how would I
[1:08:54] be able to do this?" But it all comes
[1:08:55] back to not by power, not by might, not
[1:08:58] name it, claim it, but by my spirit,
[1:09:00] sayeth the Lord. It's all about us
[1:09:02] recognizing our weaknesses in his
[1:09:05] presence.
