Lord Lord around the word of God lord we've not come together around a letter we've come together Lord in your presence around the Living Word of God lord we need to hear from you this is our desire Lord is that Lord that you would move L God the man part aside that you would take the gift Lord that you placed in my life and you would speak oh God to our Lord I ask that you'll help me to get out of the way Lord I I do all that I can but the greatest Lord is just to get out of the way that's what I want to do that you might just step forward and every need that's Behind These uplifted Hands Lord that's a need upon my brother or sister's heart whether they're in the visible audience or that invisible that's streaming that's a need that's on their heart Lord dear God that's all been in included in the atonement every every answer is in you Lord even in the questions and even in things that Lord just seem to be so impossible where we're trying to find answers to things but Lord we're thankful that God that there's a rest within our heart and that's our confidence is Lord you know our needs and Lord you're you're able to direct us Lord and to minister to our hearts and to meet that

We Believe L God tonight you are faithful and true Lord we are standing there as Believers lord well time and time again oh God you have proven yourself Lord proven your word Lord I think how David

and minister to every need tonight we pray we ask it now Lord all things for the glory of God Jesus amen God bless you just going to read a verse of scripture let you seat 1 Corinthians 14 verse one just one verse of scripture Paul says follow after charity and desire spiritual gifts but rather that you may Pro notice the order once again follow after charot that word follow means pursue it seek after eagerly earnestly Endeavor require follow after charity and desire spiritual gifts rather that may God bless you BL I want to just kind of speak to you here just a moment before I get into preaching time um you know where everything most of you get any updates you know where things are virus out there um we thank God Mercy can't think enough God watched over us and no different ones in this assembly as had I just also appreciate touch of the Lord and how God has moved for the assembly because you know everything itself uh sometimes things can be thought to be a myth until it comes to your door and the thing of it is is what we we I think where we've we've had to be at and I'm just saying we as far as those are gathered here in this assembly whether over the Internet or here there's so many things that we you want to know certain grounds to stand upon you want to know certain approaches it's like when you go to the doctor you you don't want a doctor to really to mess around you want them to be straightforward you want them to tell you say hey we're going to start you on this medicine this medicine it may not work you come back they're able to be honest and say well you know um we should have maybe taken this course or that course and the unfortunate thing that we find ourselves even chartering through here um we do not find any any help whatsoever from even those that are around it you hear this hear that and we a lot of the things has been political dump actually had to kind of sort that's not anything you don't even have to be old you can be even even the the kids see it's just just things that if in this time if you didn't hate politics Will after this uh but it's just because the thing that should be is that it's said it's a real thing we're not fearful of it we know that God God knew this was going to be here God provided faith that was not just to address that but most importantly rapturing Faith this just happens to be one of the one of the one of the parts along the way and we have to kind of navigate through I want to just encourage you within it as a congregation we're going to get through this we're going to get through um anything else otherwise you keep it to yourself because I'm really not interested because you know and I'll just say it I don't mean to be I'm not saying things to be arrogant or sarcastic but I don't uh I look at things in the positive way that's way we should look I'm not looking looking at it with a pie in the sky I believe that we're going to get through this we're going to get back to the place to where and I long for it to where that we're able to hug one shake one another's hand to be able to have fellowships things like that not not to worry about that we listen in all of that right here this is where we also have to keep our Focus because a lot of these things come you know sometimes you get to thinking about it it can just because if you think about it in terms say will we ever get back to this will this ever happen you go to thinking on that right there that can really get you down that can get you down but you've got you have to look at it in the manner that look even God knew this would be here and God is seeing us through I tell you if if anything else at all it's one of those things that just don't be looking at updates and a lot of things but look but being in prayer be in prayer that God would this is a devil it's a demon that God would send this right back to Hell uh you know these are things that when we're when we're we're looking at it and that's what I'm praying for I believe that I'm I'm I know I know I'm standing on the word of God and brother brandom would even tell us he would say regarding cancer he said they would have already found a cure for cancer if we would have been more sincere in our prayers so it really challenges our heart you've seen how brother banam rejoiced when they came out with the polio vaccine I'm telling you these are things that I'm just saying from my heart I have thanked God for what he's done and keeping his hand upon us as an assembly and I will say this I thank you for that and I thank you I've said that many times I thank you that you haven't disregarded things when it's been out here and been in one another's face everything else it's hard on us that goes completely against the principle of the word of God of how that you know where to love one another and to you you it's just something about that that you just you love to be able to express that that love and that kinship it means something to be able to reach out and shake hands with somebody or to be able to hug them around the neck and say brother I love you or a sister to a sister God bless you Sister I just really appreciate you and these are things that you know that we will we will God will see us he's seeing us through this and he will see us through this our Focus within it our strength is looking to him through all of this and just just leaning and just trusting just trusting in Him things that I've really myself I've really looked at as as as a pastor and just trying to take a lot of inventory over things uh over the course of uh this whole thing and um the one thing that seems to be so prevalent that where things sometimes will spread out is when there are uh informal moments and yet that's not always a guarantee but what I mean informal moments where here we are here and we're we're pretty much we're separated you know and so forth and we we have been able by the grace of God within this building that we have here to be able to social distance and yet in many other cases you know a lot of times in Social Gatherings people just and it's just common and normal where people would go up to one another and you know they forget about everything and they're you know just the six foot is completely eliminated and everything else is going on you know and and the precautions still aren't taken and uh I'll just say it like this you know germs are everywhere germs everywhere so Samuel what are you saying I'm saying that every time I get a shopping cart I go grab one of them wipes am I afraid no I just don't want somebody's germes on that handle why why have them on there I mean it doesn't I'm I don't want to get sick I don't like I don't like stuff I don't and uh I've been sick you've been sick our trust is in the Lord don't you I trust you to be mature in this things that our trust is in the Lord is that right it's just like if if there's a a den of snakes I trust Lord but I ain't going to walk in a dent of snake right I mean you know these are things that God has showed us and even through the messages that even as we started in March and April God brought many things to us to show this uh in these things and you know I want to say this that we've we had some times here where there's been some kind of a sometimes here and it's not intentional I do not believe it's intentional where we've had some times where maybe things people have seated a little little closer or they' set a little closer and I don't believe that's been intentional at all sometimes you sit down and somebody's been at the bathroom and you don't even realize it but really for the most part when I look out across it I really I see that where we've been spaced and the distance and all that has been there and we're just trying to do everything that we can do there's been many churches that have had breakouts and different things in some instances where some of them they have no idea how in the world that that it even happened I'm grateful to God and what we've worked for is is I I want to stay open I want to stay open and I want to do all that we can and it's going to take it'll take a little bit more for us maybe during this time we're looking at through I think the middle of uh even December but I think you know as I told you before that means if if I had to come here to the house of God and wear a brown paper bag I want to be in the house of God I want to be here I I want to be gathered together with with the saints of God and and look whether I'm preaching or I'm not preaching preaching it's just something about being together with the children of God so if that's what we have to do we you know we have to do that so I want to encourage you uh to to wear to wear the mask I know sometimes that gets hard but I want to encourage you to do that I know some of you may not even be prepared you know and you've been coming in with and I I I've sat back there and I've watched it in Services you've came in with them and you've done exactly what's been done even at restaurants come in with them you've left and gone to the bathroom with them come back with them on and all that and I know there's some that can't it's Exempted from for health reasons and and please I I'm not even into the scientific part on this you understand I I'm not this or that I'm not even trying to sort that out I don't even want the the data on that I don't I'm not trying to sort that all the way out one thing that I that I that I do know is is when I have we've looked at different brothers that has worked face to face with some people uh they themselves I know it's been the hand of God watched over them and it has been God's hand some of them have worked theyve worked 12 straight hours in a CO unit right here in this assembly and yet they but you don't see them when they when they've been in the midst of that that's why you hadn't seen them for weeks because they're right in the midst I know their masks are a little different than our masks but uh I just we we need to work together in this time everybody okay am so uh don't let don't let that you know hinder you we want to do what we what we can we want to be able to come together the other thing is if something happens let's say you know that maybe you're seated something happens in your seated a little closely please don't be offended at the deacons I've asked them I watched them here back in July when we when they they were just they did such a tremendous job God just on the Fly seeding people I sat right back there and watched it I told him after service I thought I said my goodness how you all operated and they just such a team so please don't be offended if they tap you on the shoulder and that might be your favorite seat but maybe God wants you to take your anointing and go to a different seat that day so don't be offended just let's just try to work together through this here and um we're going to get through it we're going to get through it amen and I like I told you I'm not saying that as a pie in the sky I believe that I believe that and we are going to get through this we're going to have where we'll be able to have the fellowships and I'll be able to you know hug your hug your neck brothers that is and uh you know shake your hands things like that and U so you it's such a habit you know uh that I think brother Bill standing out there one time and I don't know when it was brother Bill maybe it was in U oh my maybe it was in uh May or or something time in June and and I just just walked out of here right off the platform and brother Bill stand out there I said God bless you brother Bill I rest up my hand he said brother Samuel remember and you know it's just something about it this is this and and I feel like this attack has been an attack to try to in many ways try to dis unify the body of Jesus Christ it's tried to come against a lot of the principles that are set forth but this is where we we we we want to just have a real our faith we're looking as we've been preaching on Sundays here we're looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith that's where we get strength you focus on all this and I'm just going to be honest with you brother Samuel do you read everything no no do you keep up on everything no no I really don't I read little bits here and there but because a lot of the things anymore you know it and if you don't know it you can't see it already a lot of those things out there I don't know how else to say it I don't have I don't have confidence that the news and everything else I don't have confidence it's sad that we have to say that but it's true because you we trying to even of the months leading into us getting back together we'll preach in a minute don't worry in the months of us getting back together I I'm trying to go through all kinds of information trying to sort through information and then being on the phones with different people trying to sort all that through and uh it just is it's that in itself is an adventure trying to sort through it all but I'm thankful to God for his mercy and I just want to encourage each and every one of you let's keep pressing forward let's keep pressing forward and let's keep let's keep our Focus here on the end because soon and very soon we're going to see that amen so when we come here into the into the scripture tonight and we begin to look at this a few weeks ago and it struck my heart when we're looking at that which is of the spiritual part and and and I want to look at that Discerning the love of God once again how that Paul would write here to follow after charity Paul is giving given that this is to be the object if there's one thing that you're to be looking at and to be pursuing after and to giving yourself to it's charot which is the love of God which is the spirit of God which is the Holy Ghost because the Bible would would speak very clearly to us let no man love the world nor the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in it the Bible tells us God is love is that right over in the book of Timothy he has not given unto us spirit of fear but that of Power of Love of a sound mind so we recognize that that when we're speaking of this charity this is not a love that is based or is derived from Human love human Love Is fial Love and then it goes on down into that rotten love that becomes everything else but here charity is that which is of god and it is that where God himself self where the Bible says God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son the Bible would tell us that God commended his love toward us in first John it would say here we see his love manifested to us this was a love that man as the Believers down through the Old Testament there would be glimpses of the love of God how that it would be demonstrated it would actually be expressed in the light of the prophets when God would come and Israel would go astray the love of God would move down to project himself his love his character and his nature in that message that was calling Israel back to the character and the desire that God had for their life that was the love of God and and many times we find that when we speak of Discerning the love of God that many times love itself within the view and light of the world it's everything is just Ooey and gooey and you feel good and nobody says anything like this and everybody is just you know every is just going along that's not that's not real love because remember the Bible says a true friend a true friend will also tell you where you're wrong is that right and the Bible says they that are wise are able to take rebuke and profit from it so we understand even at the very closing age uh in that age we're living in the that last closing Gentile age as many as I love I chasen and rebuke is that right be zealous therefore and repent it's love that lets us see our error love that lets us see our wrong but you see the love of God just does not point out the error and the wrong but he projects this is where you are to be and this is where you are and so his love has a way that it does not come to just Place us and cut us off here it corrects Us by letting us see this is where you need to be but you're living well Beneath Your Privilege and he comes to correct me we say God help me Lord let me climb into that place Lord Jesus that's the love of God you see the love of God would also be as it would Paul would write by inspiration in Ephesians 5 and he would write it with the mystery of of of Christ and his bride and say that that love that is projected it is a cleansing and sanctifying love I'm glad for that tonight because it cleanses from me even thoughts that that can arise that I would have about myself and God would say that is not my thoughts concerning you and his love is a sanctifying love it just comes in it it cleanses it it moves and it brings it actually brings about and draws out of us what God knows is within us this is the power of the love of God and so when we look at this this is why that in our lives when we think of it of how the song would be wrote redeeming love has been my theme and it shall be till I die love is to govern and this is where Paul as he's wrote here to to to the Corinthian Church uh remember this was a group of people when Paul in this group of scriptures here when he's writing to them and giving them the direction for their life and their order remember the they were showing up and one had a revelation one had a Psalm and one had a song and one had this and Paul said hey you know you appreciate seeing uh the gifts and things in the body but Paul let he draws them back to a place let everything be done unto edification and edification it's self is not blowing somebody up with a lot of hot air that's falsehood but edification is the holy spirit coming in the word and taking the word and ministering to you and I what is real strength real courage not just somebody coming under an anointing and then you get out there and you meet the devil and you backtrack but real real edification is it edifies it builds up and there's only one that can build up and that's the Holy Ghost because we are not the workmanship ship of any man or any church we are the workmanship of the Holy Ghost it is God edifying remember these works that come out of our life they were already within us like the Apple like the leaf that is within the apple seed what happens his life comes his word comes to draw out and manifest these works we were already ordained to so this is we are his workmanship we can take no glory or no credit for her own I think of how brother Brandon would say even when it came uh to the examples of the maniac you know in in Oregon where brother B said I I didn't despise the man when he came across the platform when he's there with the bees you know out in the yard and you know brother Bram said if IID have known they were there before I'd have had a can and sprayed them and things like that but you see even with that from the bees and also the bull and other situations even in his home brother Ram spoke of how that love itself came on the scene and took over and brother B said how you know within that it was Sovereign how God moved down but it had to be a heart and a life that was yielded to the love of God you see you got to be tapped into the source you cannot get electricity unless you are wired to the source and that's the same way it is with the love of God and even if you're Li wired to the source you got to make sure there is not a ground that comes in it sometimes you can have you know everything wired properly in your house but if maybe a light fixture that's around the shower or something like that it gets a little loose gets a little down moisture gets in there sometimes you get a short and you're wondering why is this fuse going out why is this happening because there is some elements that are affecting that circuitry and the flow of that electricity this is why that Jude would write to us and say keeping yourselves in the love of God it would admonish us that this is something where there is uh continual struggles uh in in that that we would stay within the love of God keeping our hearts in that so when we when we we see this uh here I think how Paul would write in 1 Corinthians 1613 he says watch ye Stand Fast in the faith quit you like men be strong notice the next verse let all your things be done with charity the Bible says and all you do in word or deed do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and remember he came to manifest the name of the father Jesus was a human name he took for Redemptive purposes right but the name itself was more than just the name Jesus the power behind that is the life that same name was proclaimed when Moses was hidden in the Rock and he pass by and proclaim the name of the Lord and Jesus could say I have manifested thy name unto those thou Hast given me his name is who he is who he is he is the word it is his life it is him this is who he is your name is your character right so let all things be done with Charity in 1 Corinthians 12:13 Paul admonishing after writing of all the gifts and placing order covet earnestly the best gifts and yet show I unto you a more excellent way Paul has admonished them to desire carefully the best meaning that which is the most useful and serviceable to the body Paul writes very clearly there are some things that if done such as he says if there's tongues and no interpretations who's edified you're edified but nobody else is right and Paul he sums it all up that let everything be done unto the edification of the body I want you to notice this the focus of edification is for the body you see the body is what God himself had in his mind his body his bride that that Temple that Dwelling Place those who were the genes of his body chosen in Christ that would be born of his spirit and they would make up his body his bride his wife you and I are standing in an hour where the marriage Revelations 19 the marriage of the Lamb has come this is a time we're down through 2,000 years here the building of the Bride body we know restoring back to that place it's a time where we see that the body that all the focus is to be in edifying the body of Jesus Christ in other words that everything is the things are not about you or it's not about me it's about my brother it's about my sister it's about the body so that means the focus here's it deals with Paul is dealing with that the focus of their life and walk with the Lord would have a true substance and a meaning that's not self-seeking or self-reliant but rather self-sacrificial with love governing the life behind every person whether gifted or not with the desire to to please the Lord walking in his word and harmony with my brothers and sisters you see Paul is putting he comes into a place now that we're going to read in 1 Corinthians 13 and he's putting he's taking the focus of the Corinthian Church they're seeing the supernatural done they're seeing gifts but yet what Paul is saying is is that we need to have first things first and that is Charity should be first the love of God should be first the Holy Ghost should have the oversight within it that's what Paul is bringing them back to he's letting going to let him know here as we read in a few moments without that everything you could do no matter how great it is it's nothing so it doesn't matter how gifted or whether person's gifted or not there might be a person that can sit right here in this assembly and they don't seem like seemingly say a peep at all but they are steadfast they are faithful they are live their life is a living witness their mouth it's not their mouth that testifies so much their life testifies brother Brandon tells us something like this he says you ought to be such a Christian I believe this that you don't have to your neighbor doesn't have to ask if you're a Christian your neighbor just Knows by watching you I'm talking about the Life of Christ This is not something that is put on that like a coat you take it off and and and you know when you leave church and then you put it back on so many times you run into people sometimes on the job one morning and they say well you know uh you know uh oh my religion I got to lay my religion down if you can lay it down it's not very powerful because when the love of God has come it's it's power brother it's not something you even want to lay down it's who you are it's what directs your life it's what causes you to turn your head it's what sets your life In Motion what is it the love of God not a law the love of God 1 Corinthians 13:1 though I speak with the tongues of men and of of angels and have not charity I'm become a sounding brass or a tingling symbol and though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Ministries that's preaching understand all Mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all Faith so that I could remove Mountain I tell you that's some that's some Faith are you with me remember Jesus said if you have faith the size of a grain of mustard seed you say to this mountain be thou removed plucked up and cast into Yonder sea and here Paul writing under divine inspiration he's bringing it back and he says though you have faith to move mountains without charity it's nothing it's not that mountains weren't being moved right but he's trying to bring it back to a place there is got there the focus and the achievement is by the love of God in the word of God in the body of Jesus Christ God helps me to make that clear and have not charity I'm nothing and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned have not charity it proth me nothing you know what Paul said you can give you you can give you can hand out to people and hand out to people but if you haven't turned your life over to God fully it's nothing you said can that be possible can a could a person actually preach or speak in tongues and and their life they've never surrendered their life you've seen it right in the word look at balum balum prophesied balum said a star shall arise out of Jacob that wasn't and balum but notice here how the spirit It Came Upon him but balum down on the inside was false because he stood against the work of God what God was doing that right in Israel there was a there was a Brazen serpent in the camp sure were those people did those people have mistakes and everything else sure they did even to where bao would take him around in a place and say come over here let me show you the hinder parts of Israel but remember even though listen to me the prophecies themselves were right on the dot but bam was a false prophet why he spake against the work of God he lent himself he he lent himself to that let me just rephrase that for a moment here the prophecies that were given was in indeed here the spirit of God but yet he's a false prophet cuz he's he's coming against and he works to mingle the coming against it is to mingle and to try to join it together and notice notice balum he begins to preach a love message bring them all up there the moabites women started dancing and here lust rose up that's what the Bible says lust rose up you know Israel shouldn't even went to that Feast the Bible says not we are not to be yolked with the world when you recognize that there's people in the world you see their objectives you see their motives sure there's things that we try with the objective to try to win other lives and every life you look at I trust you do this is how I look at it God is this a potential seed you put across my path and if it's not a seed maybe it's one that they're just to be stirred in in that category that they belong in but let my life and testimony of you Lord let it be something that sets them in motion that's a desire that's how I feel when I'm talking with people we don't know that but see here he he begin to preach but you see that was a message of Baum was preaching of love but it lacked the Center focus and that was the real love of God which is the word of God keeping the word of God what did it bring sin immorality uncleanliness and that brought the Judgment of God is that right it brought the Judgment of God upon Israel because God won't play with sin so here even to see this Jesus said here he said many will come to me in that day they're going to say unto me Lord Lord have not I prophesied in thy name done many wonderful works and he will say depart from me I never knew you never had a relationship with you you knew me you used my anointing but you never allowed my life to become the center of your life you profited from my anointing come on now you you know you preached and the gift I plac your you recognize the Bible says gifts and callings are without repentance Elvis Presley will give an account for how he used that gift yeah even the men that and people who write songs if that's what you call them nowadays and other and everything else uh and I'm talking about even some of the Christian artists and whatever more you see you give an account you give an account with the gift of how you use a gift you must be a steward of the gift in your life you have to be a steward Steward is keeping that gift here coming into this place uh Jesus you know would would would express it that many many can come will come to me and say have not I done all these things but where did Jesus say he takes them back to a place to recognize that a wise man will hear my sayings and do them and he is like a man who builds his house upon a rock then he takes another man who will not do the will of God because it's going to cost him and so then what then what transpires he builds his house upon the sand storms are going to come same storms are going to come are you hearing me the same storms are going to come we're not exempt in here from whether it be cancer or whatever more we're not exempt from that we're not exempt from other things it's just like when all this virus and whatever broke out we're not exempt from that are you with me we're not exempt from from these things and and whatever more but you recognize that within it the rains and and the floods we're not exempt from you know where people here walking and then all of a sudden they depart and they want to speak evil of the way of God we're not we're not exempt from that rains com Storms Come floods come all those things come but what makes the difference where your life is founded if it's on Sand it'll give way it cannot stand the rain it can't stand the storm or the wind but if it's founded on the Rock brother let the storms come let the rain come let the wind blow we've got a place of safety it's a refuge it's an anchor that when it's howling outside there is an anchor in my soul that I know that I know that I know I have been redeemed I have been Bor of his Spirit and the love of God abiding in my soul says he's got it in control this is why I'm just going to refer to some of these places this is why when brother Brandon would he in preaching the message a token he would talk about just let me paraphrase it don't try to find me in it he just would talk about when it came to applying the blood in Exodus 12 and he said there could have been one who was a priest or whoever he was and he looks at and says uhuh I'm not going to do that I'm not going to ply that blood I don't want to be identified with that it didn't matter how much of a priest that man was I don't care who he was are you with me Jesus stood right in the face of Nicodemus right come on now that's a good man man you couldn't put your finger on his life but Jesus didn't look at him in his you know his attire and they had that you know their blue tassels and everything like that Jesus didn't say oh this guy's a Pharisee he's a religious he said you must be born again you know some of the toughest roughest nastiest meanest devils are religious Devils that's a truth so no matter how much that a man you know where where he's at how much he give to the poor think about it right somebody giv to the poor sacrificing their body but if it's not the love of God in their heart it's not even reckoned to Europe like I had a lady one time at work you know they always want to ask the spir spiritual question hey hey Sam come here for a minute you know I got this big check and you know my ex-husband he had a hard time and you know so what I thought I would do is I thought I would take my ties out of there and he had a hard time and I thought I would give my ti to him what do you think I said you did wrong but he needed help I said that tithe is God's money you want to help him get in your other pocket and get give him some money out of that come on now the Bible said why will a man rob God how did we get there notice you see this is why brother B would narrow it right down he said I'm nothing he takes that whole scriptures we read I'm nothing until the token's been applied until this token this light brother Andrew was preaching about this last week we've been we've been ministering about this that's been the theme how can how can I not preach and this be the theme no matter what angle what service it's an experience with God there has to be something what is that experience to where inside of here you pass from Death unto life times you see people can have many experiences and then you see no transformation in their life and you would wonder and say well they know they they felt that God was real but that experience was to let them know I am real why do you think when God would come in the meetings and discern the thoughts and intense of the heart and declare that I'm the same Lord Jesus that that rose up on that Easter morning and ascended back he's doing the same works that he said he would do he's the same one that stood there in flesh before Abraham's tent door why was he doing that to build the faith of his elect children in the word to receive and ask for what belonged to him Hallelujah he makes known to you and I in this generation what belongs to us by manifesting his word this token this life where there's been a change on the inside of your life that's why Paul would say think about the deception Paul would talk about they receive not the love of the truth is that right so when we think of this of even that of the love of God and remember when Jesus remember they they always wanted to ask him questions and try to trap him and they would ask him what's the greatest commandment Jesus said the Lord thy God is one is that right he would say the Lord our God is one Lord and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all by heart soul mind body strength in other words all of you God don't want part of you he didn't bring a partial Redemption right he don't bring partial Deliverance when he comes he brings hope he his works are complete are you with me amen he there is a complete work and notice here even when Jesus would would respond in this here in the scriptures here the Pharisee The Scribe the lawyer would respond after Jesus would say and you know the other is like is like so Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself because how can you love God whom you've not seen and not love your brother it's working contrary to God's desired goal and even an enemy how can you not love your enemies I'm talking about something that's much deeper than our feeling of love I'm not talking about something that just is walking up and ooey gooey and oh I love you I love that's not what I'm talking about I'm talking about a love that really praise a love that Jesus said pray for your enemies how can you love your enemy well I just be honest with you if let's say Brother Carlos you're not my enemy buddy but if Brother Carlos did something one more I don't love what he did but as far as that man on the inside I love that man but I don't love what he did but to love that man on the inside that's what brought God on the scene in Portland Oregon to be so in contact with God and to have the love of God in such a place think of it brother brandham himself he was not standing there to be seen look at when he's there in deep C to De you can watch that you can see that right here the discernment taking place think about it this is not a a Benny hen or a smiley Texon or somebody trying to get money but it stand there and say steps up to the platform say is I'm not here to be seen I'm not here for your money it is not a show the gift of God is not a show it's for the body of Jesus Christ that the body might be edified that the body might be built up in the work of God not furthering an organization God doesn't want to further no work of man is interested in his his work this is why that scribe Pharisee lawyer he said that is true Lord that is true and it's greater than all the whole burnt offerings that can be given to fulfill that but love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and love thy neighbor as thyself is greater than every sacrifice that can be given you see it's to be the underlying theme of our life the love of God is you realize love love will push Faith to do things Faith does not push love love pushes Faith so it's looking at the motive and the objective the love of God is Not erratic it operates according to the program of of God according to the will of see when anything is done no matter how good or how righteous it may seem without the the love of God motivating and directing it and backing it up it's about self just no other way to cut this cake it's about self the love of God will always direct us in humility according to the word of God according to the will of God sometimes we've got to wait but the love of God remember the Bible says the love of God constrain us sometimes it's just like it's it's bubbling right there on my lips what should I do Jesus help me to keep my mouth shut and it isn't necessarily you ain't going to speak truth but there's sometimes listen this is why the Bible says a word spoken in season you need words that are spoken in season you say God what help me to be in contact with the season with your loved ones wife home husband on and on and on and on and on co-workers help me to be in season you see it's self sacrifice this is Charity charity has nothing to do with self look what look at the operation of Charity I sanctify myself for their sakes he came down he came down and took upon a robe of Flesh he did not go to to a palace he said the foxes have a den holes places to lay their head but the son of man has no place the one who could have made himself a reputation was the very one when healing took place he said keep it down go go go go go go to the temple and do what Moses said to be offer he was not drawing attention to some who was it the focus notice this is what the very Ministry of Jesus Christ when he was here in a human body I love how brother Ram puts it it was the god of Glory come down to reveal the glory of God it was God showing himself God had a vest or we could say it like this Jesus Christ was the canvas that God was able to portray the great portrait of his life and of his nature it was a port that is it's breath it's depth it's height it's overtake self sacrifice you see it's self-sacrifice that brought the love of God into our hearts it was him that led us to die look every one of us that are married married in here tonight in order to really be married and United you had to die had to be a part of you to die and after you get married you got to keep on dying certain little things that you recognize that might be pet peeves you recognize after a while uhuh I'm not those are not going to be pet peeves no longer they're still pet peeves but we just don't feed them doggy treats you get what I'm saying we do no longer put them up there and value what this is a step well you learn right you let go of things I then what do they say the phrase somebody a gentleman the other day in the parking lot you know stopped me and I helped him load something in his truck I seen you out there was a little difficulty I have him open load some cabinets he said I'm doing all this for my wife he said you know how they say happy wife happy life he he sounded happy about it too you know but but the reality is is that you know in the things that we do you know Peter said let the husband honor the wife as as unto the weaker vessel is that right that doesn't mean that she's controlling you that doesn't mean she's leading you around but what it simply means is that you're bestowing that honor she's the queen of the home how do we get here follow after charity that's how we got here it's care it's ministering there into different needs now let me just let me just let me just try to TI this up here brother Brandon would would talk about here throughout the message and he would say this this over and over he said as far as when it comes to gifts he said we've tried said a lot of times there's been gifts that and a a lot of times he said people try to judge people by gifts think about gifts is it's a supernatural work oh that's a supernatural work but friends let me tell you something a gift itself that doesn't tie you closer to Jesus Christ you better get away from if it's a gift that's working to draw you closer to itself the flesh you better run every gift that is operating by the love of God is for one achievement it's for the body of Jesus Christ for the glory of God and it's that our faith would be tied into Jesus Christ not to where we're running back to this person or running back to that person no no no the gift the gift itself this is why think of it when when when when brother Bram would tell us judge he says many people judge people by gifts but he says if we don't use them in the right way that we're intended for them to be used they can do more harm than good how many churches have been split up with people's feelings I got a vision about this or I got a tongue about this and I got but they don't have wisdom listen knowledge is being able to see certain things and what did the prophet tell us in Christ the mystery he said there's a lot of things that are not called out right here because if it was called out it would cause Penitentiary offenses see that's wisdom that's the number one gift right there wisdom you with me that's the first one to mentioned that's the gift that's mentioned and that's it though all of out of the nine spiritual the eight can operate tongues itself the other eight can be operating and are operating right in a body and you may not even know it unless somebody wants to broadcast it God used me to do this and do this do that that's a bragger woo I ain't even there yet you see there are a lot of things that God God don't want you spreading around that's between you and him hello somebody you see this is where brother Bron think of this statement let me read a few of these he said I would rather see Brotherly Love existing among the church if we didn't have one case of healing or anything else you see the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness Faith meekness Temperance against such there's no love oh my brother BR said I'm just going to I'm going to keep moving through this he said I would rather have the Life of Christ in me to live sweet and Victorious that I would all the gifts of healing the gifts of prophecies and all them other gifts just give me Jesus let me live the life the life is what I want to live I want to live so others will know you know what I'm talking about there is people who are gospel hardened they are burnt on religion and the gospel they've seen enough fake preachers come on preach with me they've seen enough fake Christians yeah preach brother Samuel they've seen them live one way in church and in the PO and live like Hypocrites at home preach brother Samuel you see when this is why we desire not it's not gifts we desire that life let me live such a sweet and Victorious Life in Jesus Christ is that right I'd rather have that than all the gifts brother said if here he said if I came to the Lord Jesus he said as a sinner and he he said boy I'll give you the gift to preach I'll give you the gift of tongues I'll give you the gift of Prophecy I'll give you every one of these gifts or I'll give you real Divine love in your heart he said I would tell him give me real Divine love because charity never fail where all these other things are they will cease but the love of God in your heart one day glory be to God I'll preach my last sermon one of these days you'll sing your last song on this side cuz you'll be singing over there understand one of these days but let me tell you something one of these days will be your last test will be your last trial one of these days will be the last day it'll be the last time you touch the alarm clock it'll be the last time but brother let me tell you something the love of God that's come into your life that pulsates in your heart that makes you love God you love his word you give yourself to him you live in this word that same Holy Ghost the love of God will pack you into the love of God what will take us there in rapturing faith the love of God it says why we don't judge our life brother BR would say it in a prisoner he said don't judge judge your life by how how much power you had to perform Miracles don't judge yourself by how much knowledge you have of the word but always judge yourself look back and take inventory of what kind of a fruit that the life you presently live now is bearing apple trees bear apples orange trees bear oranges here in Galatians 56 the Bible lays very clearly faith it works by love love is the power of God the creative power of God that works or operates in the heart of the believer again Faith remember it Faith itself is sight to be able to look Beyond it gives sight to look Beyond and and to look to look up when brother Brandon would take this and he would preach the token September of 63 then that night he would tell them in the message token he said tonight I'm going to preach on love and he preaches the message desperation and he lays it out clearly he says what we find he said among people is a lack of the love of God and he said when there's a lack of the love of God it declares itself in lack of desperation people just kind of just going through kind of going through motions you see listen if we can try to take this and sum it all into one place it's to know the ground that you're standing is the love of God my wife is not afraid if she Burns a cake she burns my shirt or if something happens during the day and she doesn't get dinner on I'm not going to throw her out of the house no better she's not afraid of me you with me she's not afraid of me she's not doing that boy I better have this if I don't have this going to be I tell you what's the truth oh my S she's not this is not how it's up could I be disappointed yeah may be disappointed but you see it's not operated on a law neither does that mean that she takes advantage there's things sometimes that comes up there's things sometimes that maybe she gets a little her energy is just dep pleas maybe not able to do this not I'm just using examples I'm not trying to use an he understand so don't Oh Sister Kim just do an example to say the point of it's not by law what do you mean whether I sing or whether I preach I am Christ the love of God is settled in my heart I know that I've been redeemed whether I'm whether whether whether I do anything I don't have to do one more thing and that's settled like that that it's the love of God the love of God it's operating a man doesn't care if he's the one preaching or not person doesn't care if they're the one singing a special or not they would it wouldn't even maybe someone say hey you you we got too many specials W you sing on Thursday Thursday but I'm a Sunday singer Thursday though we could sing that choirs would ask that Angels would say could we join that off I'll Cherry so a man can have all knowledge and put it all together without charity everything that could be done without charity is nothing this is why the scripture admonition of every everything that's done in the church everything that's done in our life follow after charity and when listen this is where the spirit of God comes by his word to deal with our lives when he's drawing a light you realize as he draws our life into a real a real Born Again experience you realize what that is drawing the love of God Jesus said If any man love me he will keep my he says and the father and I they one we will come and make our Abode in him why will he come and Unite with someone who doesn't love it's falling in love with you and the love of God see this is where the pursuing after the love of God let the love of God be the theme of church I'd rather that be I'd rather that be know I think how brother BR would say in church order he said he said the Tabernacle here he said is not known he said out there and among other places because we have more gifts than anybody we don't have more gifts he go lays out all that he said but what it is a quality you I want you to catch this that quality of spirit same thing in Humble thyself brother Bram it takes us back into the days when the church was started and he said there would be people that would come up and they would see the congregation of people say how do you get people together what they were watching is they said them people love one Jesus said if you have loved one for another then will all men know you are my disciples thank God that's been the testimony but we don't we don't want that to become the tradition you know what that comes from hearts that are dedicated full of the Holy Ghost it's true I'm going over my time and you know what sometimes you have to bear with people who are not Believers not been born again and never will be born again they're anointed for trouble preach brother Samuel but it's the test the love of God will you allow that to bring division or the admonition in Christ the mystery cling that much closer stay with your pastor stay with that word the word what's the word doing binding you to Christ who is the strength and resource of our Liv follow after charity follow after it pursue it eagerly if the love of God is abiding in your heart then you know that and yet still it's following after charity what you getting ready to do let the love of God what how should I look at the situation put the love of God and look at the situation through the love of God it'll guide your actions it'll guide your thinking it'll give you patience Heavenly Father oh God how we are so thankful for the love of God as a songwriter would write Lord maybe as they come they could play that old love of God how rich and pure how measureless and strong it shall forever more endure the Saints and Angels song God is your love that brought you down to earth it was your love that stepped in with the fall had taken place in Eden Love Came oh God you moved down in Moses we see the love of God right there Lord we see clearly that the love of God it doesn't work outside of the word of God it comes by the the word of God he works in harmony with the word of God with the body of Jesus Christ it works according to that purpose and that achievement to recognize that Lord even how your Prophet would place it and I love the statement he makes he says it like this he says it was love that drove you oh God let love so Drive our hearts Lord let love Drive our hearts Lord let it be that oh God that motivates and directs us Lord let it be that Focus Lord oh god of looking Lord to the love of God may you guide us Lord as your children direct us Lord may I pray God for every every person Lord whether young or old whatever age I pray God May the love of God just so move upon their hearts Lord that God that they themselves would recognize the love of God that Lord your desire Lord to make yourself so real to him that Lord for any that's just been in a church life Lord to where it's just been dos and don'ts we can do this and we can't do that or we can do this but may they come to know the love of God where the Bible says his Commandments are not not Grievous but it's a love affair it's a desire to please him we do what we do because we love you and we love you because you first loved us Lord we who are the unlovable you love us oh God before there was Adam start D from molecule [Music] I was there I'm one of those morning stars who were shouting for Joy one of those that you would take job back and say job where Were You Who were shouting over the salvation of the Lamb there's a way that's been made for us oh God when I think of it Lord and to keep that may Lord God we not let that depart I know tests I know trials I know toils of Life many things come Lord try to take our Focus away from that but oh let us remember let us remember how the love of God came to us and brought us out of the world took the world out of us and placed the love of the father in us oh God no righteousness of our [Music] own it's you what love is this what love is this oh God let that be Lord within every heart redeeming love if there's one here tonight or one Lord God over the internet that does not know and has not received that love of God I pray tonight God I encourage him Lord that they would know the love of God that they would know it Lord God that of any gift or whatever that could be done it doesn't matter even if it's a gift that's being done for you but God may it be really searched out that it's the love of God that's behind it Lord because Lord a real gift a life a life is to be yielded into your hand tokens of Your Love Lives oh God that you touch the Lord Jesus and it's a love affair it's a [Music] relationship oh God I pray tonight Lord if there's one that does not have that Lord may they earnestly contend for it may they lay aside everything else Lord may they seek for that Earnest may they recognize may they not try to go one step further Lord but may they say God I need to have the love of God in my soul I can't make it one St further I'm tired of me trying to live it I want the love of God I want that in My Heart Lord God like your Prophet talked about that mother deer when that call was made like that little Fawn was in distress and that Mama charged right out of the thicket she looked around she knew that Hunter was there but it drew something in her that attribute of mother God there's a greater call that's going out it's not a distress call but it's a call to the soul that is distressed that says come unto me all ye that are heavy laden and I will give you rest oh God I ask in the name of Jesus Christ
