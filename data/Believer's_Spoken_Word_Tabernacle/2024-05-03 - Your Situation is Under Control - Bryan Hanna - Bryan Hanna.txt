they're struggling with Lord you know father Lord we just want to thank you tonight Lord we love you and we appreciate you Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen amen let's all turn tonight to Exodus 14 and verses 13 and 15 amen it was good to go to Virginia this past weekend being around many Believers and they said there was around a thousand people there at the tent meeting so we just had ourselves a time there and it was uh it definitely gets you on fire for God being around that many people and hearing the word like that that that anointing just comes down in there because there's so much expectation cuz people travel for Miles just to come hear the word of God and amen and if you've never done that or if you think you're too old I don't think you're too old there was definitely old people there and you know and uh you know they were having themselves a time so amen maybe your look of fire went out a little bit that that'll definitely ignite it put some gasoline on it amen amen as we uh open up this service with some scripture just some things that have been speaking out to me and the message why Christ speak that brother brandom preaches um and it says and Moses said unto the people fear ye not stand still and see the Sal ation of the Lord which he will show you today for the Egyptians whom you have seen today you shall see them again no more forever and then skip down to verse 15 and it says and the Lord said unto Moses wherefore criest thou unto me speak unto the children of Israel that they go forward amen so brother brandom says he first he prophesize that the Egyptians that they see they're going to see no more and then two verses later he's crying out to the Lord what what am I going to do what am I going to do amen but just want to go down to um Isaiah I gave him the scriptures back there so hopefully they can pull them up for you and brother Brennon brings these scriptures out and uh I just they really touched me and spoke to me Isaiah 469 and10 it says remember the former things of old for I am God and there is n none else I am God and there is none like me declaring the end from the beginning and from the ancient times the things that are are not yet done saying my counsil shall stand and I will do all my pleasure and then one more 2 Thessalonians [Music] 2:13 but we are bound to give thanks always to God for you Brethren beloved of the Lord because God hath hath from the beginning chosen you to Salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth amen so the god that clares the end from the beginning has chosen you from the beginning amen amen you may be seated and I begin to think about these scriptures and I tell you what brother Brandon's a preacher I have these mamist books that uh my father-in-law recommended and they bring out scriptures and that brother brandom references to and and he he goes into these scriptures and I just begin to think a God that declares the end from the beginning has chosen you from the end from the beginning and no wonder why Satan's mad tonight because this whole life is rigged our life is rigged Satan can do whatever he wants but God has chosen you before the foundation of the world Amen so good amen in John 637 it says all that the father hath given me shall come to me and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out and this is the Father's will that has sent me that all that which he hath given me brother BR said past tense I shall lose nothing but shall ra raise up in the last day Amen brother brandom said God cannot draw you unless there is a reason God has got a purpose for for you being here in this Leo Dean age the the last age the darkest age that it's ever been if you can only be get to that place how much trouble you would save God and yourself too amen and my title tonight is your situation is under control amen yes sir and brother Braham says in the message why cist speak now the Holy Spirit has one message speak the word go forward that's right don't cry to me that's the word speak it and move forward thus sayith the Lord that's the message of the Holy Ghost and a lot lot of things today a lot of us are still in that infant stage when God has sent a perfect message in this hour a a a people that's supposed to take a Rapture and we're here here still crying out to God being infants you know I remember brother Samuel saying James browny posted a picture of a grown man sitting in a high chair sucking on a bottle and we may think that's funny but how how is it to God when you know when literally Moses prophesied that the Egyptians that you see no more are going to be destroyed forever when he just passed scriptures just spoke flies into existence spoke fleas frogs spoke to Creation caused the sun to stop shine shining but then he gets to the Red Sea and he prophesies and then he cries what am I going to do what am I going to do brother bandam said oh is if that isn't if that isn't human nature when we come to a trial when God has done so many things for us we get to a test and a trial and then we cry out to Lord what am I going to do what am I going to do but that's what Satan's objective is tonight he wants to fog your mind he wants to block everything that God has ever done for you and he wants you to forget about all the all the things God has brought you through amen and Moses crying out I just referenced to that he he already proved proved what you say will happen I'm with you and here the circumstances Rose in a moment what must I do what must I do hey Lord what must I do do you hear me and he already ordained him and Vindicated him and he proved and worked everything through him and brother brandom said Moses was actually crying out for thus sayith the Lord he wanted thus sayith the Lord and um brother Braham said Moses's call was thus sayith the Lord and a lot of people you know a lot of people listening to the message of the hour today I've heard so many times you know well brother brandom you know that wasn't thus sayith the Lord that wasn't thus sayith the Lord but his very own Vindication calling was thus sayith the Lord know amen and that's the same thing for you if God is calling you tonight that's your thus sayith the Lord you don't need God to do a special sign you don't need to say oh let this Robin you know show up and do this for me or any you know sorcery or witchcraft that they want to say it is you know but we believe in the word of God Amen that's everything that God goes by is the word of God amen amen but brother bam said Moses forgot he predicted the end of the very Nation he was brought up in he goes I hope you understand huh so brother Bram is now picking up typing himself with Moses and I'll get to that here in a a little bit but Moses forgotten brother brandham starts to talk about Moses's faith and how faith is being paralyzed and brother brandham goes through that he said faith is great uh big great muscles with hair on its chest amen and and I begin to think of the word paralyzed what happens when you when you become paralyzed you can't move anymore the muscles that you did have become weak they become flabby and you forget to how to move and and that's when Satan likes to attack when your when your faith is paralyzed that's when Satan likes to move in and brother Bram said what what causes that to happen paralyzing Faith he goes when you when you doubt any word of God just like Eve in the beginning she doubted that one word doubting that one word will paralyze your faith that's right and he said well why can't I do that I ought to do it you know so and so does this why can't I do it you know so and so is in the message you know cutting their hair why can't I cut my hair so and so is wearing high heels in the message why can't I wear high heels in the message you know and you say oh that's brother branham's opinion but his very call was Vindicated his message was thus sayeth the Lord he didn't need to see say thus sayith the Lord after every sentence well brother Brandman says I believe how many hands want to raise up and say I believe the message of the hour amen hallelujah either your faith will paralyze your the glamour of the world or either the glamour will paralyze your faith Faith now you have to take one or the other just like the first sermon I I spoke God doesn't like mixers amen it's either his word or it's not his word amen if you're guilty of the least you're guilty of the whole amen you see the Bible don't change God God don't change he's the unchangeable God and then he begins to talk about lot and how lot and Abraham you know they were on their journey together going to you know Canaan and but then they started to have you know those hard times and then Abraham had to separate from lot but during that time Abraham made that fatal mistake going down to Egypt because of hard times and um I don't know if brother Brandon said this or not I just remember that um I might have been brother Donnie but um just when I was listening to him when I was younger he said that that situation which with Egypt actually influenced lot to go down to Sodom so your decisions that you make with your family with your friends you know your close loved ones you know situations that you make you know in your home you know maybe watching a dirty movie with swearing on it may influence your children down the road to do wrong things amen so true amen I don't think it should be a strange thing like brother Samuel said many times that the the message should be playing in our home amen that's good pre so hard times um begin to rise up so so Abraham but Abraham learned from that that first time in Egypt and then but Sodom lot went down to Sodom and Abraham wanted to keep his eyes on the promise and when he didn't when he kept his eyes on the promise like the last service I was saying he always stayed prayed up looking for that visitation amen but lot wanted prosperity in Sodom but his faith was so paralyzed he didn't see that fire now notice this his faith was so paralyzed he didn't see the fire that was going to destroy that very sword of life he was so consumed with the things of the world what was trying to make his own life prosperous instead of looking to the word of God that he was missing the very signs the message of the hour for his day go by same thing with with Noah's Ark you ever just think to yourself Noah's building this huge Ark and all these animals are going in too 2 by two you think people would wonder why are those animals going in but they were so busy and consumed with the world that they missed the very sign the message for their day amen I don't I don't want to be one of those people amen amen and uh brother brandom also talks about the woman at the well her faith her faith was so great that when the very Messiah discerned her heart she began to cry are you the Messiah you're that one that the Bible has spoken of the prophets that have spoken about but when Jesus discerned the Pharisees heart they called him beel up amen that's true same with David and Saul they were both anointed you know but one was man's Choice which was Saul but David was God's choice man's Choice failed first he was anointed with the the vial of oil but David was anointed with the the Horn of oil amen and when they came against the Philistines in the next chapter after David was just anointed they come to that that that battle with the Philistines and Goliath Saul saw a big old great giant 10 n feet however tall he was and I remember my father-in-law studying and he said Goliath had a 30-foot reach couldn't even 30 feet out with how how tall he was his wingspan his Spear and his shield 30 foot reach Saul saw a giant but when David went to battle he went into into into dancing because he knew he took the word of God he his faith wasn't paralyzed he had he had Jesu those five Stones fa a it Faith amen and brother brandom said he began to uh swing that sling amen then that stone went a th000 miles per second and struck the very not per mile per second and struck struck that that Goliath in the head and amen and and I just like how David David even spoke of the outcome before it even ever happened he said today I'm going to cut your head off amen and that's that's what faith is Faith doesn't look at the present time faith brother brandom types it as binoculars binoculars are to look a far off Amen brother BR says you don't use binoculars to look to see what time it is right you don't use that but you use binoculars to look way off for you see for you see faith is what God wants done oh I hope this goes in faith doesn't look at the present time Faith doesn't see this here Faith looks to see what God wants and looks accordingly that's what faith does it sees what God wants and what God wants done and Faith operates through that amen and faith faith picks up God's binoculars amen both sides you got to look through both sides the old and the New Testament amen and some binoculars just come preset they don't come with the adjustments but some binoculars come with those adjustments that's why some people can't you try to explain this message to them I you know I I have many people I've witnessed to and I've spoken to them around I was like why can't they see this why can't they see the message of the hour but they don't have those adjustments like you know like we do we're we're predestinated we have we have Malachi 4 who came in our age who came in our day to adjust our sights were off we were seeing three we were seeing blurry Visions amen but God came by and brought Malachi for and was able to tune our sights amen we're able to look far off not not at the situation at hand you may be going through a hard time with maybe work or a a loved one where it just looks like they're not going to come to the Lord but look to the promise amen amen and also too brother brandham also brings out with Moses and Pharaoh he looked out there so Moses and Pharaoh looked out going back to the same um with the children of Israel Moses and Pharaoh looked out the very same window uh Pharaoh seing nothing nothing out there but a bunch of mud handling people slaves prison being killed every day beat with whips made fun of their religious beliefs called them fanatics but when Moses looked through them he looked at them and said that's God's blessed people that's right his eyes didn't fall on the glamour of Egypt it fell on the promise of God Amen and that's what he was commissioned to do amen hallelujah and also bringing out the this I love the story of Esther this just just came to came to my mind and just how she was so directed when the king asked for his first wife to come she didn't come to him and that's what the the denominations are today when God's making a call those denominations rejected you know rejected Jesus Christ so God you know in Revelation I can't remember 18 he said come out of her my people God's calling a bride not a girl not a baby he's calling a mature bride amen and that's why I've been listening to this message why Christ speaks so many times brother BR he said speak a baby can't cry or a baby can't speak an infant cannot speak it's a mature word bride amen and that's what God has called us to do in this hour amen but I just love you know we've heard the the story of Esther so many times that she began to you know the king made an order to try to get another bride and they came to uh the Chamberlain haii and she was the only one who asked what the king liked amen they were the ones the others she had the binoculars amen she had that desire to be adjusted we have that desire to be adjusted amen amen when when the message comes and it rubs you the wrong way and you tighten up and you don't want to be adjusted that that's the wrong spirit amen um Esther wanted to be adjusted and she began to she found favor in the sight of the king and the only reason she found favor in the sight of the king is because she put on the Royal apparel amen and she was instructed by hegi which is our Malachi for tonight amen and I just loveed it it the scriptures are just so perfect you can't make this stuff up it said Esther was brought into the King's house the 10th month the seventh year yeah there you go of the king's Reign amen good yes sir amen and that's when we begin to rain when God sent uh Revelations 10:7 amen yes sir amen so but they're begin to have a situation arise with Esther you know we know um hmon had evil intentions you know destroying the Jews he hated Jew the Jews he hated Mori and he began to plan plan something to destroy the Jews and Esther got word of it amen but brother bandam said look at tomorrow instead of today look at the promise instead of Glamour look at the people instead of the organization see God did that and I just love in in the story of Esther she she comes and wants to make her request to the king but it's it's death if you come to the king without being without being called amen sir but in my opening scripture it says no man can come unto me unless the father draws him amen so brother brandham said it was death to go into the holies of holies now it's death to not not go in amen so she made her request before the king and the King took down his golden scepter amen that was deity coming down to earth in Revelations 10:7 it says a mighty Angel has come down deity has come down deity is not in heaven anymore deity is on the earth amen and his bride yes sir so she began to make her request and I just I just love it Esther had them to come to a banquet hmon and the king and whenever you make your request you know just say hey s why don't you why don't you just come along I'm going to make my request in front of the king amen but it it just struck me that Esther didn't make her requests the first the first day she had the one banquet but then she's like let me wait till tomorrow and like I said brother Bram says look at tomorrow instead of today there you go look at the promise how of today Christians rely on their senses and what they can see and what they can understand instead of faith I believe something in Esther do you know led her not to make her request that day that's and after that first meeting that banquet hmon got so mad he got a you know his heart was hardened just like pharaoh and God like I said God is declares the end from the beginning this is all a setup so hmon haymon's heart got so hardened by his wife and his friends he went and built some Gallows to hang morai amen I just want you to see how perfect God is if Esther would have made her F her request the first day The Gallows wouldn't have been built hmon so Now esther made her request the second day and she exposed hmon and those very Gallows that hmon built was his own hanging amen so just wait on the Lord don't be in a rush God has as a perfect timing look with those binoculars don't look at the clock of present time just wait on the Lord he'll direct you he'll lead you and guide you he'll give you the things to say to pray what to do our footsteps are are ordered of the Lord amen amen amen isn't God good tonight yes amen and you know like I said and the Lord hardened the heart of pharaoh the king of Egypt and he pursued after the children of Israel and the children of Israel went on on the high high hand and that's just what God does he he waits time is nothing to God God waits for the ex brother B said God Waits For The Darkest Hour the darkest moment to come on the scene amen just like he did with the three Hebrew children amen they um they look to the promise of God they they built a statue of of Daniel you know a lot of people today want to build a statue of brother Brandon but we're not here to bow down to any man we're here to bow down to the King of Kings which is the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen I I believe brother bram's a prophet more than anybody you know anybody criticizes brother brandham just you might as well just walk away from me cuz I'm probably not going to be nice you know but I don't I don't worship brother brandom you know I worship my Lord and Savior amen amen but like I said the the three Hebrew children didn't look at their condition they didn't look that the king made it seven times hotter we're here in the seven Church age the darkest Church age it's ever been the heat is great amen but we got to look to the promise tonight amen and what did they begin they they remembered the law of Moses not to bow down before any Idol God said I am the Lord your God Thou shalt have no Gods before me for I the Lord am a jealous God Amen I believe I believe they begin to remember the the law of Moses the prophet that they they that they read about amen and they they begin to say if if it be so our God whom whom we serve is able to Deliver Us from the burning fire furn fiery furnace and he will deliver us out of thy hand oh King but if not be it known unto thee O King that we will not serve thy Gods nor worship the golden image which thou has set up you think the devil stopped right there no no he did not That's what Satan does he'll take you he'll take you all the way he'll keep pushing even even when he's been defeated so many times you think he he would have realized by now amen he tried to kill that seed all along even he killed he killed Jesus Christ on the cross he brother Braham said he he couldn't even catch that Revelation that Jesus Christ was was the Messiah the chosen one and me he lost that battle he went down Jesus went down to Hell kicked the door open took his keys you know brother B I said he think he slapped them and then and then left and and and Satan still tries to come at us amen that's just how dumb he is amen amen just remind the devil that's right Jesus shows up at The Darkest Hour amen it was seven times hotter not only seven times seven times hotter the most mighty men that were in his army Nebuchadnezzar to bind the three Hebrew children to cast them into the the burning fiery furnace so then they began to walk to that fire furnace and even those mighty men that were pushing them perished amen and it's only by the grace of God we're still standing here in Le oia amen we're we're still in our own right Minds we don't have the reprobate Minds people literally going and saying the things that they're trying to pass and and all the laws in Congress amen mighty men that we thought of are Fallen amen their minds are corrupt amen but I just love this quote it's a little lengthy but he said here comes another angel who is he let's see maybe he's Michael let's think he's Michael that great angel that stands in the presence of God I can see him draw a sword say master look down there one more step see listen one more step and it's death right before them have you considered them God said yes let me go down there we'll see who's boss when we get down there I believe he could have done it don't you I can hear him say Michael you you have obeyed me since that day since the day I've created you but I can't let you go because I'm going myself this is a man-sized job amen aren't you glad Jesus or God became man amen exposed his humanity and became one of us Amen brother Bram says my I I can see him Rise Up from his seat his robes dropped around him walked out there and say way back there in the north I can see a great big white Thunderhead I can hear him say come here amen every everything in heaven obeys him and that man thinks he knows more than he does you see so he can't obey him I I can see him come here East Wind north south and west get under this Thunderhead I'm going to drive you like horses this morning he take that big Thunderhead stepped out like on a chariot reached up and got a great hold of a zigzag Lightnings out there in the skies cracked it across the sky King neb King Nebuchadnezzar could hear it down on the earth down there and about that time he passed by the Sea of Life brother Bram said he picked up a palm leaf when they when they had when they had their last step into that fiery furnace there was one like this like unto the Son of God standing Fanning away all the breezes like that Hallelujah and this is what I love he was and what they were doing in the fiery furnace brother Braham says that Fourth Man was talking over the future with them amen hallah amen he's God today he knows all things amen amen and that's what the message of the hour has come today the mighty Angel has come down through brother brandom the son of man revealing a a son of man revealing the son of man telling us our future amen we're going to a future home amen he's pointed us to where we where we've come from amen amen and just bringing it down to our day brother Brandon and why Christ speak he talks about the Finland boy and how you know how many people brother brandham told people two years prior to write write it in their Bibles of the description of the boy what the layout was you know the mountains the rocks and everything and that boy laying there dead clothes torn bloody coming out of his eyes ears and nose limbs broken he was in a horrible condition just like we were born in leod deia Born speaking lies born in sin it types the last Church age with that boy being in the worst condition he could ever be Revelations 3:17 the last Church age is the worst one of all knowest not that thou are wretched miserable poor blind and naked amen are you seeing the type there amen I remember many of you remember that little boy raised up in Finland and I just love this quote and then and then from the dead been killed by an automobile and I stood there on the side of the road and brother B said he he looked at the little boy that was dead and he just began to walk away and he says but I I turn and look back and he said something grabbed me on my shoulder and I turned back and looked amen and that's what Malachi 4 has done today turning our hearts amen we would have we would have walked away from this message we we would have missed all the signs brother brandham literally looked at the boy prophesied just like Moses and he he was literally going to walk away but God in Mercy put his hand on his shoulder and turned his heart amen and that's what God has done to us today in Le O deia he's he's turned our hearts back to the word amen hallelujah and brother B says I begin to recognize that little boy his haircut his his clothes that mountain and then he the the two brothers with him he he's like hey go get your Bible and and read it back to me amen Lord and I looked around and they're exactly brother Braham said exactly the way the Holy Spirit had told me two years before is a situation under control when all you wrote All you wrote in your Bibles Across the Nation that it would happen amen that very prophecy wrote in scri in people's Bibles typing prophecy wrote wrote in Bibles our Bible today Luke 17:30 the son of man Revelations 10:7 the voice of that that angel Malachi 4 turning our hearts John 14:12 verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father this is one of my one of my favorite scriptures recently if ye abide in me and my words abide in you Hallelujah you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you that's the condition you have to be in if ye abide in me and my words abide in you brother B says then ask what you will amen not cry but speak Amen brother Bron said I said there is nothing there it is nothing can stop it the situation is already under control the faith that was within my heart was anointed oh if I could only explain that the the faith that God God had told me it never failed the situation is under control now here's exactly what I showed you two years ago and here it is laying just exactly in order the only thing I love this brother B said the only thing you have to do the only thing left now now is to speak the word once you realize the time for your day once you realize God has drawing you and that this this message is for you and that God has revealed that whatever comes your way God will be with your with you just like he said with Moses I will I will be with your mouth amen and brother Braham said that's the only thing left was to speak the word amen amen what's what's your situation tonight amen try not to look at the present day what's going on right now just like the Hebrew children Esther even Samson David you can I mean you can type everyone out Faith looks a far off God's promise amen amen there's there's been so many signs around us you know things that have happened not to just say oh that's wow that's that's pretty cool you know brother Brandon prophesied that wow you know but th I believe those seven visions that he had in 1933 with musolini invading Ethiopia and his own people turned on him you know Hitler and coming to a mysterious end and those isms combining into one communism and brother brandom said watch Russia and they weren't even called Russia at the time they were called Soviet Union and man then he talked about the driverless car right and then the moral problem mostly with women how they got the right to vote and how they're dressing and then the last or the second to the last one uh a woman rose up in America you know he said he didn't know if it was a woman or the Catholic church but there there was a minister over I think in Africa or something but a denomination and he actually played brother Brand's vision of this sixth one brother brandham says he's seen a president or vice president dressed in purple and there on the video was Camala Harris standing in purple raising her hand being sworn in there's only one Vision left and that's America and Ashes we're we're at the very end have can you see the signs around us just like the Finland boy amen can you see the Mounds in place the the boy laying there Dead all these all these Visions my my father-in-law had um his uh his sister go through every message and count how many prophecies brother brandom said how many um discernments and there were over 8,300 and not one time was brother BR not brother brandham but not one time was God ever wrong because it wasn't brother brandham it was God and brother Brandon amen but Israel right now in in their current state right now it's just a size signs of the time amen and brother brand said and it anoints us when we see that we're living in the last days see lot's Faith was so paralyzed he couldn't see these signs but AR aren't you aren't you grateful you can see these signs amongst us to find out all these signs that we're seeing see being taken place that spoke of in scripture would take place in the the last days all the way from Heaven to political Powers the nature of people the demoralization of the world among the women and how they could do in the last days and how the men would do and how the churches would do how the nations would do and how God would do and see it all laying right here before us amen amen let's all stand tonight and just want to as musicians to come and just to read a few more things here man but brother brandham spoke about you know the the world's condition about all those prophecies but what did he what did he speak about the bride what her condition would be he goes now remember this this is in the church age book let's um sing um the battle of the Lords K of d k of d now remember this Christ in the true church is in a condition of the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist spe would come in the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and Powerless it exposes Satan revealing his Works attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting discrediting of God's word right down to the time he is cast into the Lake of Fire amen so see that's that's how what Satan does he's going to come to the very end but don't be discouraged brother Bram says he fights that he can't stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for and what she can do and that she can do the Greater Works here it is brother Braham said she will be an invincible Army if they can get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework it's either God working or it's either Satan working and I I'm just so grateful for this message that has exposed Satan we're able to see the signs even the and even The Temptations in your life I mean just even listen to the greatest battle ever fought I mean this world is literally going insane if this world would just I know they're not going to but if every doctor physician every person can listen to that message this world would be a whole different place if they would have just accepted the message of the hour this world would have been a whole different place God's spirit discern him withstand in the Antichrist spirit saan will be powerless before her and brother bam said I'm so glad that a man can live so close to God till the devil don't know what to do with them amen pharoh or uh Moses just kept speaking that word in Egypt to where Pharaoh finally said just get out of here amen and one of these days we're just we're just going to keep speaking that well we are speaking that word right now but one of these days says just like just get out of here and once once we I believe there's people on Earth that are realizing who who who we are and this Rapture is going to happen any moment brother bam said the bride will not be here when a a nuclear bomb or an atom bomb goes off amen oh God I wish that every sick person here this morning that feels the holy spirit in in in our presence now could realize that that's the evidence of prayer that you you prayed has been answered in the presence of God every man who wants the baptism of the Holy Ghost he goes if you'd feel that little Grand feeling saying I believe that's the truth you he brother bam says you take that he goes That's the evidence of an answered prayer amen just that that little faith that may rise up in your heart when you're praying for a situation brother bam said that's the start of an answered prayer you know you may have a loved one that's out in the world or a condition where it looks all hope is lost or you know something you may be have struggled with for years but that that little faith that begins to rise up just like Hatty rice says I that's that's nothing but the truth and she she spoke salvation for her two boys I believe it was amen and I just have uh my testimony [Music] [Music] um I was going to read this last time but um just felt to read it today something brother Samuel spoke I was sitting back there doing video streaming and I was struggling with something in my life for years I went up and got prayed for many many times tried to speak it myself but um one service on a Thursday and I I believe it was the Lord that spoke I'm going to I'm going to tell you I was doing things that you know were not good I'm very ashamed of but I'm just thankful for the grace of God that's so good you know I I thought my situation you know was out of control not under control that's right would I ever be delivered I had that desire but would I ever be delivered and if you have that desire of a loved one or you know something you're struggling with you know I just want to see if this you know just bless this with you brother Samuel one day said even the things you are contending in fighting right now remember I am with thee I will strengthen I will help Thee I will overcome through you Hallelujah I will manifest my overcoming power I will strengthen you and that thing that you fought with and contended with I will make known my glory and you shall see there is no more contention for I the Lord have helped thee that is so good amen that that's my God tonight Hall [Music] amen he's guided me all all my days you know Satan has tried to take my life you know car accident and tried to you know speak lies about my life and many things try to destroy my life through certain things but you know I'm I'm just so grateful for this message you know when when people just criticize this message walk away from it it it uh it just breaks my heart because I know what it's done for me it's it's it's not some man that did has some cool stories but it's a it's a reality reality to me that that burning bush that Moses walked up to I've experienced in my life amen amen amen let's just all pray tonight if you have a need that
