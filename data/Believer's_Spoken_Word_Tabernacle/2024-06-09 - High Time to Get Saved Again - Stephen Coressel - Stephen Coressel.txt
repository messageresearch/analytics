sometimes and shakes you a little bit that you don't even know what to say that might have happened to me just now because you guys just I never heard this song before in my life but I liked it but it's even more powerful especially with the words and things like that and what I'm preaching this morning in case you're wondering what my title is It's called high time to get saved again High time to get saved again and uh we're going to talk a lot about this song this morning and uh isn't it just so amazing God can do things like that you know you know that really encourages me as well do you know why because I'm a man just like you so you know I got my own mistakes I got my own problems if God came to me and said hey you're going to have to take care of all these people good luck I'd be like buddy I can't even take care of myself let alone anybody else but aren't you thankful we just put ourselves in the hand of God and he's going to take care of all of it amen he's the one that runs the Church of the Living God he's the one that runs the services amen aren't you thankful for that I know I am I'm so thankful that he's always in control he's always listening he's always paying attention to where we're at amen amen does God have to do things like that no not necessarily but he does it anyways to let us know he's listening amen o well I'm ready to have church amen you ready to have church amen I'm excited amen if you have your Bibles we wish you open up to Romans 13 uh Sur it's good to be with you all again and uh we just love you all in the Lord and I'm glad to have my wife here with me my kids had a I guess they still wanted to go camping I don't get that brother but but that's okay more power to them I suppose and uh surely love the Lord amen and we just appreciate this time with you all we appreciate your pastor as well we love them in the Lord and uh we're we're so thankful to be able to be able to fellowship with you all and uh and we do de in a grand privilege we read greetings from Brother Wayne and them at trood as well we just love you all so much amen Romans 13 we're going to start at verse 11 Romans 13 we want to start at verse 11 the scripture reads and that knowing the time that now it is high time to awake out of sleep for now is our Salvation nearer than when we believed the night is far spent the day is at hand let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of light let us walk honestly as in the day not in ranting and drunkenness not in clamoring and wanness not in strife and envying but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ and make not provision for the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof can we bow our heads for a prayer most gracious kind Heavenly Father we just thank you Lord Jesus for your grace and your mercy Lord we're so thankful For Your Love To Us oh God as the Bible says here in his love not that we loved God but God loved us and gave himself to be the appropriation for our sin sins and Lord to know that kind of love that while we were yet sinners you die for us and that was you commending your love to us oh God I pray we don't doubt that love in our lives anymore but to know that it's of assurity and it's a and it's a steadfast hope that we can hold on into our hearts that it wasn't God didn't love us based on us but he loved us based on him that he wanted to do it and he said he would love us and so that's why we gather together Lord that's why we're all here Lord just to hear from you God we believe you're already working in the midst of this service Lord we believe with all of our hearts Lord and we just ask you Lord whatever you have for us oh God we're just going to lift our hands and accept it from you Lord say God speak to me God use your word and just Minister unto me Lord what I have need of oh God we yield this service and we surrender into your hands now in the name of thy son our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ the bride set together amen God bless you you may be seated excuse me just pray for me this morning my throat just feels Just a Touch weak um like I said I'm going to preach a message called it's high time to get saved again it's high time to get saved again now that might sound a little strange as I say it may sound kind of confusing but you know brother Bram said one time that sometimes we have to say things in a little bit of a different way to to present it in a different light so it more clinches with us it becomes a little bit more real to us sometimes we have to go outside of the box to see what's in the box and uh you know brother brand would preach a message called a thinky man's filter he got it from a cigarette box right you know you always got to pay attention because God's always uh God's always speaking you remember something the The Whole World's made by God the whole world declares God's glory yeah man made it up man messes it up but listen they can only pervert what God's already created you even look in Hollywood and I don't mean to mention Hollywood or nothing but but you look at anything that's even remotely successful in one sense a lot of times those storylines and things are like are based around self-sacrifice or sacrificing for somebody else or forgiveness and things like that why there's a movie uh again I don't bring up movie there is a chrisan movie from the 70s about the life of Jesus called The Greatest Story Ever Told and why is it called the greatest story because it literally is The Greatest Story Ever Told remember brother B did teach us that the gospel is a drama amen It's a drama of God expressing his attributes towards us and what was one of those attributes how much he loved you see see oh we just I said in my prayer so we're going to go down it amen when the Bible says he commended his love love towards us okay in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us okay what is God trying to express to us he is not necessarily trying to express that he does love you though he does he's trying to show you just how much he loves you amen why because it says in Romans 5 he said for a good man somebody might die for a good man and even for a righteous man some would even dare to die but God is going to show you how much he loved you in that why are you were yet a sinner Glory why you weren't even looking for it even him knowing all the mistakes and failures you were going to make he still died for your sins you can't write it any better than that amen you see this is a drama amen God is trying to express these things to us and so sometimes we have to say things in a little bit of a different way for us to approach something that we all do deal with and that's what I want to kind of do so like I said this title may seem strange because you might sit there and go brother Stephen you're saying it's high time to get saved again do you mean I need to get saved again I mean what are you trying to say and I think that's a fair question so what I'm first going to talk to you about is what I'm not talking about what I first want to express to you is when I say it's high time to get us saved again I want to First tell you what I'm not talking about if you do have that first quote in 61 in questions and answers brother Braham says something pretty interesting here he said he said well he said I want to say something this is somebody talking to brother brandom he said you I've heard you say that if a man was once saved that he could never be lost okay and what did Brother Ram say to that he said I said that's exactly what the scripture said and listen I know this can be hard for us to graas sometimes because we do look at this through human eyes you have to understand something if God ever saves somebody they can't lose that you hear me that's right now listen you need to throw your flesh out the door you need to throw your opinions out the door okay if God ever saved anybody that that means they can never lose that can I can I say it like this for a second do you think God Wast his time no I don't think God Wast his time amen so if God came down and saved somebody guess what they're saved and they can't lose that and your Prophet said that's exactly what the scripture says he has eternal life and shall never come into condemnation or judgment but has already passed from Death on life I said that's what that wasn't me said that that's what Jesus Christ said now isn't that something yeah see and I'm going to tell you something it's so hard for us to grasp our minds around this sometimes it can be hard for us to understand this fully because we'll look at it and go but look how they're acting look what they're doing okay but I want to present it like this just real quick just so you can understand it a little bit it is not so much that when somebody is acting wrong that ever they were saved or not the issue was or that they that they are God saved and lost their salvation the issue is were they ever saved to begin with that's good you see so what is fruits what is manifestation it's evidence of salvation but you do remember something about this real quick and now we're going a little bit different okay you remember repentance is a work of the Holy Ghost you hear me repentance is a work of the Holy Ghost so just because somebody has failed God and got caught up in a sin or something like that or did something terrible does not mean that they're out of the will of God still now if they don't repent and justifying themselves ah something's wrong but listen if somebody does mess up and they come and say I'm wrong I Repent how many times should you forgive them how many times should you forgive them how many times he going to do that I know you know where I'm going cuz Jesus was asked the same question wasn't he that's right how many times should I forgive my brother till seven times said nope till 70 time 7 amen I guess there's not a limit then you see we have to stop looking at Mercy and this salvation through our eyes because we're not doing the saving preach at brother Stephen that was so good we're not doing the saving it's not my salvation that makes you let you get in it's his amen so if God Saves somebody who are we to say he can't that was so good amen who are we to decide who gets a make it or not we're here to build God's kingdom not our kingdom oh well I feel it we're not here to preach we're not here to build a message Kingdom either right all right come on did you know brother bam didn't actually build a kingdom himself right the kingdom was already here did you see it it was already here amen it's Jesus Christ Kingdom you remember Jesus Christ never left the church he may have let the church World they may have put him out but God never let the left those who believed in him in the Book of Revelations the Bible says the son of man walked in the midst of the golden candlesticks what is the golden candlesticks brother B taught us what it types it's the seven Church ages he never left the church ages he never left the the church the church left him to the point of he's outside the door knocking isn't he but do you know he's still knocking think about they put him out what did Jesus do glory to God you ought to thank God for the mercy and Grace of almighty God I feel like if we had the opportunity to do it we would have put him out too you know brother bam said we would acted the same way like Eve but this eve and the last day is pre predestinated not to fall that's good that's good amen not that we couldn't fall we're predestinated not to do it is because of God's grace and mercy Hallelujah and when Jesus Christ was put out of the church ages what did he do he didn't keep walking did he Glory he turned around and started knocking he still wanted us to come in oh you see what I'm saying it's uh the the the the mercy of God is far past trying to figure it out right so then why do we spend time doing it listen now I'm going to talk about you for a second why do you spend so much time trying to figure out the salvation of God in your life am I really saved or not am I really going to make it or not why do you spend so much time doing that when the Bible says whom the son of man has set free is free indeed so what he said you know what blood brother said in the church age book he said do you know how you know know God loves you he said because he said so that's what he said because he said so cuz he said he did so why isn't that enough you see what I'm saying amen we always question these things we always get nervous about it am I going to make it or not if God ever saved you once you are still saved tonight right or today you're still you were saved last night and you're still saved now still thank you amen so I'm talking about what I'm not talking about that's good when I say high time to get saved again we're not talking about getting more salvation somehow when God saved he's better at it than us when God does something it happens amen do you know how powerful this salvation is let's put in a little bit of context amen we're going to we're going to talk about a little bit about Saul and David's relationship okay because you look at Saul Saul was called of God to be king of Israel okay but listen Saul did some pretty bad things he did some pretty rough things first off he disobeyed God and try to justify why he disobeyed God yeah saying you know remember Samuel came the prophet came and said I hear the bleeding of sheep he said oh the people made me do it see excuses right blamed everything else by him he he was the king you know what I mean he wasn't some beggar he was the King right he was the king of the nation he could have told the nation we're not going to do it right but he said oh the people maybe do it this maybe do it oh we could use the money all these things right so he was openly disobeying God true amen not only did he you know how much he disobeyed God do you know how much he did you find out later uh Samuel will call him the enemy of God Amen he couldn't even hear from God anymore the spirit of God was departed from him I wonder what the church World thought of him would have Saul would have walked in the back doors here today the Bible says that the spirit of God departed from him and it was so departed from him he had to get a help from a witch yeah that's good a witch of Endor that's how far down he went that's good that's good amen remember and remember that witch got nervous cuz she remember he disguised himself so she didn't know it was the king at the time and said well hey you're going to get me in trouble here don't you know the king said there should be no Wizards and witches right and that's the very guy who made the rule to make her scared was calling for a witch to help her so look at this he's disobeying God he's such a hypocrite I needan such a one I mean a big one this isn't just like lie on your IRS form listen okay you know what I mean who knows you know whenever you do your taxes you don't even know if you did them right you don't know what's going to happen right IRS calls you and says hey you owe $110,000 what are you going to say about it you know what I mean so but this is more of this is way bigger than just a little hypocrite amen and we know what's going to happen to Saul later Saul's going to turn into a murderer remember he may not succeed but he did try to kill David not once not twice three times he tried to kill this guy because of Envy did you know Saul even tried to kill his own son yeah isn't that something I mean this is terrible and the spirit of God left him amen he couldn't even hear from God anymore getting a witch to come and bring up Samuel now remember this Samuel was somewhere cuz Samuel does come up remember that amen there is life after this amen just cuz you die don't mean it's the end of it remember B taught us that amen death is just changing where you're your real changing where you're at amen doesn't change who you are you remember that right if you're saved now you'll be saved then if you ain't saved now you won't be saved then he doesn't get better after death only for those who accepted him amen so Samuel was somewhere and that witch brought it up amen and guess what brother Ram taught us Samuel was still a prophet he was still a prophet and what did he say listen what would the church have said about this man Saul what would the church said oh they've been a little nervous to church I'm preaching now I hope you're with me listen I've Been Around Church people quite a bit you can't hide from me I know how this stuff works that's true one little thing happened and boom get them out the door they shouldn't be sitting in here don't you know what they did don't you know what they did sure they probably did sure they probably deserve it too remember you will reap what you sow we're not talking about that amen I've said it like this before amen you can be saved but you eat moldy bread you might get sick from it didn't make you any less saved that day you just shouldn't have ate the moldy bread it's the same thing amen you do bad things you reap bad things yeah okay when you do bad things you'll reap them amen Saul reaped Saul did everything wrong ends up dying a horrible death loses in battle and so forth loses his family loses it all but when Samuel came up Amen brother bam taught us this this is the scripture brother bam uses to teach the lesson of once saved always saved that's good this is the story he uses when Samuel came up he said you and your sons are going to be with me just one little sentence there I even had I reread it up in my office just to make sure I had it fresh in my mind I had to read the passage three times cuz I missed it just one little line yes you will be with me that's so wherever Samuel's at that's where where Saul is amen don't you see once you get saved when God Saves you you're not even strong enough to get you out of it amen think about it how saved was Saul how saved was he he was he was so saved as a murderer a liar disobedient to God and he still made it that's right think about it how I hope you understand what brother Stephen's trying to say what am I not talking about okay when I say get saved again I'm not talking about you need more salvation okay when God Saves somebody he saves him for good when God saved listen you listen you are not a mistake you are not a failure in God remember salvation is of the Lord he's the author and finisher of our faith don't you don't you say he started it you didn't even start faith God did the Bible says you're even saved by faith and that Faith was a gift of God so God gave you the faith to believe and then now he say he started he said he's going to finish it and you're going to sit there keep trying to pull your hair out all the time oh it's so hard to be a Christian oh I'm not saying it's not listen when you start thinking with this with your flesh of course it's difficult that's right when you take your Works your body of works and everything you've done uh you know I've always wanted this you remember when brother BR went beyond the current time and he was you know well how over old he was probably 4550 I can't remember exactly but you think about it you know he s in the bed you know he's fraying about he said Lord I haven't done enough for you right if I he said if I'm going to do anything for you Lord I better start now and you think to yourself what do you mean yeah look at all you've done look what this man done and look what his effects of his ministry do today it still affects us is it that's why this message is so amazing can you say Amen those quotes were spoken 60 years ago and somehow when God takes a quote and you can feel the anointing hit amen amen and you go what it still works today still somehow that's why you know why it's because that was God's message it wasn't brother bams it was God's message it was the word may flesh for our day amen glory to God and Hallelujah but you do know even brother Bram dealt with this idea amen and he was and they're going I haven't done enough for God yet look at that he was looking at everything he's done at things like that and he realized H still not good enough you know I wonder if we do that sometimes too when you think with this of course you're going to fail oh yeah of course it seems impossible but I'm going to tell you something you need to quit this and just look at this just look at this this has the power to change you it sure does this has the power to do it I I've told people that all the time oh you know it's been so hard to serve the Lord I asked him did you read your Bible today there you go well no well yeah I guess it is there you go is that so surprising brother BR was asked right how do you get closer to God read your Bible and pray every day what do we always seem to forget listen just so you know I'm throwing myself in with you I have failed God in this too amen I've seen how different my days was when I opened this versus not I've seen how my days were different amen and then you sit there and go oh man it was so hard it was so hard to be a Christian today oh boy and you didn't even didn't even go to the source of Christianity you're not even supposed to do it by yourself why you keep doing it by yourself then that's good PR you know they even you know you you see those things at Walmart they have the pictures now right if something too big hey you need somebody to help pick it up amen right you got to get you know double team whatever those pictures are you ever see them and you're supposed to get two people for heavy lifting and you're sitting there trying to pick it up by yourself and God is just a phone call away amen call them up call them up tell them what you want Jesus is on the main line now you know where that song comes from right it's the idea of when they had to used to do the old phones right it's not it's hard to relate now because we don't do the operator anymore but back in the day you had an operator and they're the ones that connect phones well if somebody was already calling that person they couldn't push you in it was already in there right and the song is telling you that there's nobody in the way there's nothing in the way for you to call Jesus that's Jesus is on the mainline there's nobody in the way you can get right there as soon as you want to call him bam he's there he's ready to listen he's ready to hear what you need amen he's on the main line there's nothing in the way for you to talk to God Amen nothing in the way for you to do it amen you love the lordo God is good can you say Amen am so I hope we understand I got some scriptures to say this but we're going to just keep going because I feel good amen so I hope you understand what brother Stephen is saying what I'm not saying now when I say it's high time to get saved again I'm not asking you to find more salvation right not asking you to uh you need another salvation because when you messed up you lost the first one God didn't waste his time on you you are not a mistake to God God don't mess up you know what I mean God don't mess up amen he can take your messy life and make it the will of God isn't that so amazing amen I think I shared this with you last time about Jonah you remember the story about Jonah amen Jonah messed up everything yeah he was supposed to go to tarus he went or neeva and he went to Tarsus he walked the opposite direction amen but God took his mistake and made it the will of God isn't that something God took away he didn't do what God told him to do and yet Jesus will take that story and say as Jonah was in the whale's belly for three days and three nights shows how the son of man be in the heart of the earth did you know Jonah's the only type of the Resurrection do you know Jonah was representing that so you remember what a type is type is more than just connecting scripture it's a prophecy types and shadows in the Old Testament were Prophecies of the New Testament so Jonah was expressing a prophecy of what was going to happen to Jesus later and it was such a prophecy Jesus quotes it as one as a reflection of his own Ministry now think about this for a second how did Jonah end up in that whale's belly that's right by doing what God told him not to do did you know why Jonah was in that whale did you know why he didn't go Anya first he tells you later in Jonah 4 why he did it he said because he understood God was a merciful god yeah and he knew if he went there and and presented the word he knew they get saved and he didn't want them saved that's pretty hard to hear amen it almost sounds like Jonah's the villain of the story a little bit he did not want to save them but God wanted them save so much he said too bad Jonah not even Jonah a prophet could stop God trying to express mercy and salvation to somebody that's what God does to people who try to stop salvation throws them in a whale's belly you need to go down there and think for a second you need to go down there and think for a second and what did go and God took that attitude of that Prophet yeah God took that mistake that mess up I mean he he was not acting according to how God wanted to do it that's right amen his attitude his personal opinion if you will what he thought was no I don't want them saved right and God said you're going there because I want them saved it was completely opposite and yet God took that attitude in that story and transformed it into a type of the resurrection of Jesus Christ amazing that's amazing God is so amazing ain't he don't ever downplay the grace and mercy of almighty God that's right God is good at it God can take mess ups and I'm talking about major mess ups I'm talking about bad things he can take horrible things and transform them into the will of God that you'll look back and you won't even be able to find the mistakes anymore of just how great God was amen God Amen so that's I hope you understand what I'm saying it's the time to get saved again I'm not talking talking about what God did in your life I'm not talking about that I'm not talking about salvation so then you would say well then brother Stephen if that's not what you're talking about then what in the world are you talking about and I think that's a fair question I think that's good remember as I said we looked at Saul and we looked at everything Saul did and the mistakes he made and we know that David become Kings after you know so amazing about the Bible it's even amazing the Bible records these stories of these mistakes these mans have just so you know people always want to question whether the Bible's true or not this is one of the vindications of the Bible just so you know is that it's not just a historical account of Israelites you know how we know that because Israel wrote about all the bad things they did then there's no nation that when they get their own history books write about all the bad stuff that's right you know when I was in public school amen and we learned about American history we didn't read about all the Native Americans we killed come on now you know brother B said there's blood on the flag you know brother said that right absolutely because of what we did to the Indians but did you know I never learned that in American classroom I didn't learn that in an American history book you had to you had to kind of dig a little bit and you find out oh boy we weren't the best people were we amen all I read about was Pocahontas and John Smith you know what I mean right oh yeah they love for us to come and take over their lands and put buildings all over the place they really wanted us to do that yeah right you know what I mean you see what I'm saying a country doesn't write about their own mistakes and their own history books amen and yet you look at the Bible they're writing about all these things why it's not a histor it's not just a history book of the Israelite people it's God's word being spoken to us and God is showing us a comparison here between Saul and David here yeah showing you something about salvation showing you something about what's going on just how powerful salvation can be yeah but like I said this is what I'm trying I'm getting to what I'm talking about amen is that when you looked at Saul despite what Saul could do he could never lose his salvation amen now he did lose the benefits of it sure amen he lost the presence of God didn't he and remember this David saw that David saw what happened to Saul and Saul and David still respected Saul isn't that so amazing what a great attitude David had you know what I mean towards somebody listen might be a lesson for oh now oh that felt good that's a lesson for us can you say Amen you go that look how David treated Saul that even though this man tried to kill him three times he wouldn't touch the Lord's anointed wouldn't even touch him matter of fact when that man came and said he cut off the head of Saul well that guy thought he was going to get a pretty good penny from David hey you know David I took out your enemy right when the world looked at David and Saul they thought they were enemies true but that's not how David felt about it Oh Glory to God isn't that so wonderful but I you want to become an invincible Army it's not about just how big and tough we are in faith and things like that Saul and David were an invincible Army so much that Satan couldn't even separate him Hallelujah David never looked at Saul any different David was a part of an invincible Army I'm going to take that home and study it later that's good that is so profound to me because that man have thought they were enemies so much that he cut Saul's head off and said hey David look what I did for you he said how could you raise up the hand against the Lord's anointed and he had that man slew that man who slew Saul thought he was doing David a service found out he was actually cursing David David never looked at all like that once help me Lord can you say Amen am towards one another towards each other towards them out there how do you look at them how do you act towards them hallelujah boy I I've been preaching a lot about this lately so you forgive me about this amen don't ever condemn the world for the things they do that's all they got that's right of course that's all they got you go oh you're surprised they're a sinner it's like it's like somebody jumps in a pool and you're trying to wonder why they're wet well of course they're wet they fell in the pool that's right oh look at all these Sinners out there of course they're Sinners that's all they got the only they they'll make it is for salvation what you have and don't forget that I say we be like David amen let's be like David in this regard anyways because there's some other regards we're going to find out here in a little bit amen because David ends up getting caught up and he starts doing some bad things that even Saul did and did you know David was actually half more successful than Saul remember Saul tried to kill David right he tried to but he failed right but then and all of a sudden David one time caught a gliss of a woman amen and he wanted that woman you'll find out later when Nathan approaches David later about it Nathan said if you would have asked I would have gave it to you that's what Nathan says he Nathan tells him if you would have just sought the Lord and got it you could have had anything you wanted yeah and that's why brother Ram said if he would have asked for basba he would have gave it to her wow but he decided to go a different route didn't he and just took her that night and all of a sudden guess what she's with child David Goes uh-oh remember he's King though remember that yeah this ain't just some joeo doing it this is the king of Israel amen remember we're all human you remember that we're all human that's from the pulpit to the back now you got to reap what you s don't me wrong about that but never for get about mercy and Grace David was the king and he also sudden impregnates this lady and so what he just tried to do oh wouldn't it have been different if he would just came out and apologized wouldn't it just been different no he didn't do that did he he's like I gotta hide this I got to do this secretly I gotta hide it you remember something you never are hiding from God you're never hiding from God oh you might hide from me amen you might hide from Pastor you may hide from Mommy and Daddy but you're not hiding from God later on you got to find out Nathan calls him out said what you've done secretly God's going to punish you openly so we know that's why David is doing this he's trying to hide it secretly and what does he do what does he do he's going to send a riah to battle oh no wait I'm sorry I skipped a step didn't he he first tried to get Ariah home to trick him a take a break buddy everything's okay and this remember arah was actually one of David's Mighty Men one of his closest one of those Gentiles that came with him you go and he just sat on the porch just sat on the porch he said how can I have pleasure with my wife knowing what my brothers are doing out there whoa hey orai is a good guy wow he was worried about his friends out there look how great this guy is yeah wow respecting the nation respecting what his calling was as a soldier respecting his other the soldiers he said I ain't doing nothing I ain't with my brothers out there like that now da you think that would have pricked David's heart there yeah there you go well look how great this guy's acting look what I'm doing oh I should repent that didn't happen did it so what did what did David do isn't this something David sends a letter to joab says I need you to do something for me did you know David didn't send a letter to just that oh anybody he didn't send it to everybody did he he sent it to the one guy he knew get the job done David knew what he was doing David knew what he was doing send a letter to Jo out put him on the front line take care of it joab said got it boss sure enough arriah goes to battle there and dies in the battle battle David waits for a little bit then takes bash Sheba ah everything's huny Dory everything's good nothing wrong oh look how great he is I'm not like that Saul over there do you realize this is pretty just as bad way anything salt did yeah same boat same issue and all of a sudden one day I hope you can put yourself in the story a little bit there's a reason why God put this in the Bible there's a reason why right nowed cuz I have no doubt we've all been a David like this no doubt whatsoever that we've all had David moments amen but listen if you're a Son of God it won't say hidden it won't St hidden if you're a child of God he's going to fix you and sure enough Nathan shows up amen Nathan the prophet shows up says you know what I kind of want to read it now amen it's first it's uh it's either 1 or 2 Samuel 12 wow you know why uh I was actually just rereading it and then somehow I memorized the location so I want you to read this with me if you don't mind 2 Samuel 12 verse one 2 Samuel 12 and verse one the scripture reads and the Lord sent Nathan unto David and he came unto him and said unto him there were two men in one city the one rich and the the other poor the rich men had exceedingly many flocks and herds but the poor men had nothing save one little amb which he had brought and nourished up and he grew up together with him and with his children and did eat of his own meat and drink of his own cup and lay in his bosom and was unto him as a daughter boy God laying on thick yeah he is sure is isn't he laying on thick look how much important this was to this man yeah verse four and there came a traveler unto the rich man and he spared to take of his own and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd to oh I'm sorry and there came a traveler unto the rich man I wonder who this traveler was who is this traveler cuz watch what this rich man's going to do for this traveler and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd to dressed for the wayfaring man that was come unto him but he took the poor man's lamb and dressed it for the the man that was come to him wonder who that traveler was I wonder if that mind battle comes in your mind sometimes it wasn't him was it it wasn't the rich man it was the traveler that came by and he wanted to take care of the traveler not so much take care of himself so who actually want who actually wanted that lamb the wayfaring traveler The Traveler he's dressing it for the traveler you see what happens to us sometimes you'll get a a traveler in your mind a waying person in your mind a thought in your mind and what happened you started entertaining it you started giving a life with your thoughts and your actions and what happened all of a sudden you're killing your best friend see it wasn't actually David though you see you see that in that scripture there I hope you can see that there came a traveler unto the rich man it's not the rich man just wanted another sheep a traveler showed up and wanted that lamb but then the traveler the the man didn't want he when the rich man went to give a lamb he took the lamb from the other person entertaining that wa that traveler that's what happens to us we entertain things contrary to the word that's how you get caught up in this stuff that's how David got caught up in it amen and so then he asked him and dressed a man and then vers five watch and David's anger was greatly kindled against the man and he said to Nathan as the Lord liveth the man that had done this thing shall surely die now who's the one that actually took the lamb though was it the traveler it was the rich man and so David was upset boy David was mad I think you should be mad did you see though he thought he'd done this secretly so who could know what he actually did look when David judged the situation that Nathan just presented he condemned himself he knew what was going on was wrong David knew the rich man knew this was wrong amen anybody looking at the story knew that the rich man is the bad guy in the story you can tell yeah the traveler may have tricked him maybe or something amen he might have get caught up in something but who did it so no wonder David was upset David was mad presented this story and go there's no way that man should die to death verse six and he shall restore the lamb 44 because he did this thing and because he had no pity wow boy yeah yeah he laid it on thick didn't he oh he's righteous look how great I am d already forgot what he did verse 7even and Nathan said to David Thou Art the man Thou Art the man thus sayith the Lord God is I know the king and deliver thee out of the hand of Saul so forth we're just going to stop there Thou Art the man so see not only what David did was so horrible amen it was so terrible what he did not only was it that terrible when David judged the situation he judged himself wrong to Die the death he should restore he should be taken cuz he had no pity that came out of David's mouth so not only does David know this he knows what was wrong he know he did it secretly he know he was wrong and like I said he wasn't much better than Saul at this point amen but I'm going to show you his reaction to it if you don't mind turn to Psalms 51 that's good Psalms 51 that's a good Psalms 51 I want you to read this with me again I'm trying to present this in such a way I'm trying to tell you what do I mean when I say it's high time to get saved again what does it mean what do I talk about because look David's got a lot of problems right now don't he and remember he's going to reap a lot from this he's going to reap aot he's going to lose that child he's going to lose that child even when he tried to fasten save the child's life still wasn't enough so he's going to reap what he got from this but I want to show you how he reacted to something he did like this it's in Psalms 51 and just so you know in case you ever wondered I don't know if you ever read the little things in the beginning part before verse one but it says to the chief musician a Psalm of David when Nathan the prophet came unto him after you are gone in to basba so this Psalm is a direct re reaction to what what Nathan told him amen and when he was finally faced with his sin amen and remember he actually was going to say I I should die the death and I'm done what did God say I departed your iniquity from me amen oh isn't that amazing how saved are we that we get so nervous you know what I mean and why am I preaching this you're going to see in a little bit amen we use these sometimes in the excuse to stay in depression to St nervous and anxiety that's good and situations will happen all a sudden you're shaking getting nervous I think it's time for you to get saved again amen get back to what saved you that's good amen it wasn't these situations these bad times that got you saved Jesus Christ was the one that saved you you go yes sir cuz this is what happens to David here and remember he saw what happened to Saul he saw that when Saul left a of God an evil spirit came on him and all of a sudden David finds himself in the same situation he finds himself a murderer an adulterer a thief he was coveting his neighbor's things he was against the word of God he's finding himself in the same situation and so he's going is the Lord going to depart from me is an evil spirit going to come upon me then that's good and watch what he says verse one have mercy upon me oh God according to thy loving kindness according to the multitude of thy Tender Mercies blot out my transgressions Wash Me thoroughly from my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin did you know he is saying it's his sin oh that's a big deal right there there you go yes it it wasn't anybody else's fault it wasn't the Traveler's fault it wasn't the soldiers fault he threw away the excuses yeah that's good blot out my iniquity there you go my transgressions sir amen verse three for I acknowledge my transgressions and my sin is ever before me listen this is difference between Saul and David here what is David trying to do he's trying to get saved again he's trying to get saved again but it's not getting more salvation he's trying to get back to what he already had the traveler came and threw him off maybe and what does he has to do he has to get back to where God saved him then there you go I hope I'm preaching amen it see you never lost your salvation you never lost it but sometimes Satan will come and try to throw you off course try to throw you try to focus on people focus on situations focus on disheartening and and and just shakeups and so forth you got to get back to what saved you that's you got to say to yourself it's high time to get saved again there you go I'm going to skip down to verse 10 Psalms 51:10 create in me a clean heart we know this song Don't We and renew a right Spirit within me watch what he says in verse 11 cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy hope Holy Spirit from me why is he praying this cuz he knew what happened to Saul he knew what happened and he found himself in the same situation I wonder if that happens to us sometimes oh you're acting good around Saul during the beginning of your life listen I'm going to preach that just for a second okay I'm going to bring it real real okay when you get first Saved it's the greatest time in your life yes I know it was for me when I was first Saved I was a house on fire in a windy day yeah amen I there was nobody I wouldn't witness to I'd bring it up right even if they didn't ask I'd bring it up I got everybody mad at me though I found out real quick people don't like serpent seed people just don't like it now see when I first found out Ser seed I loved it I was said this is the greatest thing I ever heard and I was so on fire I told everybody but what happens when you start living a little bit yeah there you go what happens when we start living a little bit and start walking some of these trials yeah what happens shoulders start slumping a little bit what happens your knees start getting feeble a little bit and and in one sense I'm not necessarily blaming you for it it's life life can be tough sometime we got to go through trials and things like that and disc discouragements to build us up God knows what he's doing amen he knows what he's doing with David here it's not like David surprised him with this but remember maybe God sent David through this to teach us a lesson of his attitude towards what he did compared to Saul and that's what's going to dri and and David is looking at this and going yeah I'm messed up but I know there's one thing I can't miss and that's the spirit of God God don't depart from me take not thy Holy Spirit from me that was the difference between Saul and David when David finally met his sin and condemned himself he ran to the sight of God and went back to when he was saved amen hallelujah that's so good yes sir verse 12 restore unto me the joy of my salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit David still admitted he was saved he still admitted he had salvation but what did he lose the joy of it the feeling of it the thing about salvation that stir you up a little bit sometimes I know you ain't saved by feelings amen but don't throw the baby out with the bath water I like feeling good in God don't you I don't want to come to church and be all sad and depressed every time I show up I want to feel God I don't want to lose the joy of my salvation when God saved me I want to still shout about it the Bible says in Job 38 when the morning Stars sitting together and the sons of God shouted for Joy what was the Joy about the joy of thy salvation Hallelujah that's a good connection that was pretty good wasn't it praise the Lord Jesus amen when they were shouting for Joy what were they so happy about it wasn't all the nice cars they were going to have or the big houses but that God was going to them amen Lord they were shouting for Joy amen they were happy for that salvation what did David lose he didn't lose his salvation he lost the joy of it and he recognized that and he ran to the side of God to get it back can I say something to you if you're getting a little too depressed you forget what it means to be happy as a Christian yeah you need to get fall flat on your face and get right with God get back to God none of this stuff none of what you're going through is worth Lo worth losing the joy of the Lord that's right right there is nothing hear me are you hearing me there is nothing worth losing the joy of the Lord hallelujah yes sir there's nothing worth it right your bitterness has never been worth it that's good well I thought we were supposed to be all happy and everything here I am though [Music] man you being right is not worth losing your joy uhhuh true that's good you hear me yeah you cuz you know I know how that bitterness Spirit works the first step to bitterness is justifying it yeah you got to justify it Satan knows if it doesn't make any sense why be bitter about it but when he can start making it make sense oh they did hurt you didn't they yeah oh look what they did to me see what is the first step to bitterness oh this is all free I hope you understand God's talking amen what's the first step to any bitterness he's got to justify it convince you of it makes sense don't it that's what he did to Eve makes sense reasoned with it makes sense don't it you ought to feel bad about this kind of makes sense don't it you being right is it worth losing your joy of your salvation bitterness has never been worth it why what is bitterness it's an unforgiving Spirit there you go that's what bitterness is it's an unforgiving spirit yes sir and if you can't forgive did you know you can't believe that's right I'll give you some homework it's in perfect Faith go right after the scripture reading brother Bon makes one sentence that a part of me wishes he would have preached the whole message on but he makes one sentence he said faith is based on forgiveness yes he did faith is based on forgiveness so if you can't forgive you can't believe and do you see why David's praying this restoring to me the joy of my salvation I don't need why because because if he doesn't have the joy something's replacing that Joy then it could be shame condemnation remember you're not supposed to be under a condemnation spirit either God forgave the sins of the whole world you ain't that bad your mistakes weren't that bad God's grace is still stronger than you your sins ain't stronger than God's grace amen so you don't SP so you see what I'm saying if there's no joy then it's being replaced by another spirit amen it's re being replaced by condemnation it could be replaced by bitterness and none of that stuff is worth what it's supposed to be there the joy of the Lord the joy of the Lord is my strength thank you Lord I just remembered it amen so if you got no joy that's why your knees are feble it's why you getting scared about everything that nervousness spirit is coming in yes it is why do we get depressed you know what I mean I want you to think about it from the outside perspective okay just for a second okay you know if somebody promise you're going to live forever and everything going to be hunky dory and you get sick he's going to heal you he's going to take care of you and everything like that amen you'd be like well then if he covered all my bases what's there to be nervous about you know what I mean and so then if you do start to become nervous though don't you feel that be a little weird from look at it from the outside for a second wait a minute that guy owns everything and he just told you he's going to take care of everything so then somebody would look at you go why are you getting so nervous true and think about it why don't you look at yourself for a second why do you get so nervous that's good right why do you get so scared it can't be because God has failed you because God don't fail anybody has God ever failed you I can tell you something God's never failed me that's right oh I have failed God oh yeah plenty of times yes sir but God has never failed me once and so I want to make sure you understand what I mean when I say it's high time to get saved again I am not talking about whether you're saved or not but look what David lost when he forgot about his salvation when he got on the Wayward side if you will and did what he did amen what did he have to get back to not salvation no but he had to get back to the Joy the feeling of being saved I have so many quotes on this but I if you guys don't mind let me just read one quote for you and we'll call it amen watch what brother said it's in letting off the pressure in uh 62 watch what brother Bram says here 62 it's towards the bottom of the sermon just so you know it's the second to last quote brother said letting off the pressure I want you to read this with me he said now we you must continue with the faith that you have when you feel the presence of the Lord is with you you know what I mean listen like I said you're not saved by feelings I get it there's going to be times when you don't feel nothing you're going have to stand on the word that's going to happen Okay but surely when you feel him you ought to be standing too you know what I mean it's okay hear me church it's okay to feel [Applause] godall it's okay to be happy to be a Christian amen I really like how he says that I'm G to say it again I think now you must continue with the faith that you have when you feel the presence of the Lord is with you now many people wonder what happens they seem like they're healed and then after a while they don't feel that way but it's because that when prayer is made and the presence of is with you Faith mounts up and then when Faith leaves well then something happened to you you must remain with that Faith right what is he describing when the faith mounted up okay it's not like you got more faith but Faith was put up to a place where you're like all things are possible right you're going all things are possible and you're in the presence of God then when you start to leave it what happens oh Faith kind of like I said you didn't it's not lowering the amount of faith faith moved it's not mounted up there anymore and you're going oh wait a minute since it's not mounted up anymore uh something wrong no brother man said something happened he said and what does he say to do he says You must remain with that Faith don't never let that feeling leave you don't never let that feeling leave you what was David doing he wasn't trying to get more salvation he was trying to get back to the joy of his salvation the feeling of it you know what I mean when you feel saved I'm not just talking about when you have to say you're saved amen and that can work don't get me wrong you're supposed to do that you're not saved because of feeling but listen it's okay to have a god with skin on sometimes too you know what I mean as as that you know that boy said one time with that Mama coming up in the attic and and that mama said well son don't you know we believe in God don't worry about the thunder we're Christians we believe in God he said yeah but it's nice to have god with skin on sometimes that's why yeah you believe in healing don't you but sometimes it's okay to come up for prayer cuz sometimes you need a god with skin on see both are just as true it's okay amen and listen sometimes you're going to have to stand there I'm saved do you feel like it nope but I know it's the word but you can't do that forever and sometimes you're going to need God on your side and sometimes you're going to be by yourself and your faith mounted up when you were first Saved right and you're going to be sitting there going man Lord this has been rough I'm I'm going to testify to you right now there's a reason why I'm preaching this this morning may not be for you but it's for me cuz we go through rough things don't we we go through tough situations and you're sitting there trying to figure it out and you keep focusing on the situation so much you kind of forget that God's in it all the time and you kind of forget sometimes wait a minute we're still we still win you know what I mean I'm still saved even if I mess up this situation a 100 more times I'm still going to make it amen [Music] and sometimes when you're in the trenches you kind of forget about this sometimes and that's why I'm saying it might be high time for you to get saved again get back to what it meant when you were first Saved brother B said that one time oh the times when I was first Saved that's you know what I mean and I know I can testify like that I kind of wish I can go back to that guy amen I think I've testified this to you before I you know I I one of my gifts is I got to huge memory I just remember a lot and so when I read the Bible I can almost tell you what it's going to say before it even says it and it's just what God gave me right but what can happen to me sometimes is I'm easily bored then it could be hard for me to read this and I know that sounds tough for a preacher to say but I'm just being honest with you if there's a fault I have it's being too honest sometimes to be honest with you but the reason why I say that is that one time I prayed I got down on my knees and said God I wish I could forget the Bible I've said God I wish I could forget everything so I can go back and read it again so I could go back and read it again yeah and listen sometimes you need to go back to when you were first Saved go back to that moment get back in that feeling you know what I mean when you were first reading it when you were first seeing it amen get back to that point amen yeah we go through tough times don't we Church amen we go through the ringer sometimes and sometimes it's the only thing you can think about and it's so clogs your mind you ever been there sleepless nights you keep thinking about it over and over and over again amen if you're not thinking about it you're just sitting there like a vegetable you know just trying to figure it all out amen we've been I know I've been there y so I'm trying to tell you what you should do in this situations when you find yourself there why don't you just get saved again go back to that certain scripture that spoke to you you know I got one you know what it is it's job 38:7 it's what I just quoted to you earlier it's the first scripture I ever read in my life that I read it and I finally saw myself in the Bible when the sons of God shouted for joy that was the first time I looked and said that's me that's me see go back to the those scriptures that spoke to you go back to that message you what message I go back to oh listen you're going to have to forgive me church I'm betting a little bit now okay I just feel so at Homer sometimes I get in trouble because of that you know what I mean letting off the pressure 62 in June oh no it's not letting on PR it's super sign super sign and I go back to that quote sometimes you just have to listen to it again because it takes me back to an experience I had when I was first saved that was one of the first sermons I heard and brand was actually remember when he raised that baby in Mexico um and so the next day the the papers interviewed him and he's talking about that and a Catholic Catholic journalist interviewed him says you believe our Saints could raise the dead too brother B said well that' be hard because they're dead right how can a saint raise the dead when you can't be a saint until you're dead right right so he said what's your opinion of the Catholic Church brother REM said I'm sorry you asked me that and he said and he said uh do I got to answer it he said i' like to hear you brother said it's the highest form of spiritualism there is there you go and he said what do you mean he said well all these gods and goddesses that you pray to he said they're dead yeah Mary and all these people they're dead so you're just praying to dead people yeah and the reporter said well Mr brandham Christ Jesus Christ died and you worship Him He said but he raised again on the third day and he's alive now he said [Applause] amen now I tell you that story to tell you what happened to me when I first heard that CU I was driving to work DMP going on 66 North in a green Focus yeah I still remember everything and when I heard that come up on my thing I just had a jubilee in my car I was in both lanes ditches having the time of my life I I'm saying that because God is taking me back there for my sake right now and I'm so thankful for what the Lord did for me and I have no doubt you got testimonies in your life that sometimes you're going to need to go back to go back to when you were first Saved what it felt like get back to that feeling again cuz I'm want to tell you something church and I'm going to close with this I'm going to invite the musicians up oh you forgive me church I went way long didn't I you forgive for that let me tell you something though this is just brother Steven a little bit life don't get easier no sir the more you go through life the more you're got to find out it's just going to get harder and hard and can I say something as Christians it's kind of expected to happen remember brother Ram said you did not got you did not get saved to be on a picnic right you got saved to be a soldier amen so I'm going to tell you something life don't get easier so but instead of trying to figure out how to make it easier for yourself you need to spend more time trying to say okay Lord how do I deal with it yeah that's good that's real good you start praying God I'm not praying for the burdens to disappear but I'm praying for the shoulders to Bear them yes amen yes sir I'm not praying for everything to just disappear but Lord I'm praying for the strength to hold up still Lord the Bible says when a righteous man falls he falls seven times but Lord I need the strength to get up again yes sir cuz you supposed to keep getting up like I said life ain't going to get any easier remember Isaiah remember Isaiah in the Bible he's he he he had a brother one time he thought was going to be great Hezekiah he thought he was a great king and this King did do some great things the Bible says that Hezekiah did that which was right in the sight of the Lord but that one time he walked into the temple try to take the priest's office leprosy was found out on his forehead and he died a leopard brother bam tells us in letting off the pressure or I'm sorry identification that he said that uh Isaiah looked up to Hezekiah and all a sudden he got confused yeah said wait a minute how could this great king do something like this how could this great man do something like this see Isaiah was looking too much at the man depending on men depending on man to fulfill everything and when that man failed seemed like all of Isaiah's World failed that brother Ram said he was trying to figure it out all of a sudden one day he's praying and guess who showed up the Lord and the angel showed up the train filled the Temple what's that train is that smoke the incense fill the temple and all sudden can you imagine put yourself in Isaiah's shoes you're looking up and you see Angels there seeing the Lord high and lifted up and the angels had their faces covered their feet covered saying holy holy holy is the Lord where was ezekiah it was nowhere to be found it was the Lord high and lifted up oh yeah and when Isaiah saw this as he was struggling about some other man guess what happened to him all of a sudden Isaiah forgot about Isaiah oh I'm sorry Isaiah forgot about Hezekiah all of a sudden Isaiah forgot about him and guess what he was in need of prayer all of a sudden what' he say as soon as he saw that what did he say Lord I'm a man of unclean lips glory and I dwell in the house of unclean lips what did he found out none of us can do it Hallelujah none of us all of us have been failures all of us fail when he looked at Hezekiah when the Lord showed up he forgot about him he said Lord I'm I'm that man now I'm the one that needs God's help I stand in the knee of prayer and aren't you glad the vision didn't stop amen cuz what happened one of the Angels took a live coal from the altar Glory took a live Co and touched his lip and what did he say he said thou are clean glory to God you're not going to be clean by a man's testimony you're not going to be cleaned by somebody else's reputation you're cleansed by the blood of Jesus Christ who died for your sins and I'm telling you it's high time to get saved again back to [Applause] [Music] that we love the Lord let's bow our heads for a prayer most gracious kind Heavenly Father Lord I just thank you Lord for this morning's service Lord I Thank You Lord For Your Grace and your mercy and your love towards us oh God I thank you Lord that we're not saved by a man's opinion or may has reputation but we're saved by

blood of Jesus Christ restore unto us the happiness that came with it yes we now know Lord we never lost it we've never lost our Salvation yet but Lord we're done using excuses to stop that Joy being in our life praise the lord we want to be happy Lord we need we need your mercy and Grace and joy and love just just to fall upon us this morning Lord to speak to our hearts Lord to remind us of when

thankful for it I pray if anybody's got that bitterness Spirit they they throw it out in the name of Jesus they put it upon the altar of fire lord when when the sin offering was offered to Israel when it was put upon the uh the the the the altar of sacrifice it was burnt completely I pray we put that bitterness that envy that condemnation Spirit put it upon the Altar and let it be burned completely

things we're going to need more of you Lord than ever there's been before God we got to get rid of all these things all the doubts and Fears let them all be burnt in the presence of God let your love

feel your presence Lord God I pray nobody would let this chance go by them God but they know of assurity that the Lord is here with them the Lord is trying to work on them God is speaking to them and God is more than willing to take all their pain and their suffering God is willing to be their helper yes Hallelujah pray we give it all to you now Lord oh I can't stand that depression lord I can't stand that worrying I can't stand that nervousness Lord I even feel like your spirits saying that how much you despise those Spirits Lord how much you hate it when we give in to worry CU When we do we're forgetting your promise Lord that you said I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me that all things are possible to them that believe I'm here Lord God as myself to die to my insecurities to die to my fears to die to my depression Lord because I want the promise to become alive in my heart and in my world Lord God lord I can just feel your spirit you just e those things

in God Lord created me a clean heart create me a clean heart get rid of the filth get rid of the unbelief Lord create in me a clean heart let not thy Spirit depart from me Lord amen let your Holy Spirit just overshadow us right now Lord oh I pray as the church of living God we just lift our hands and we just say unto the Lord Jesus Lord r down upon us Lord r down upon us Lord let your spirit just come down upon me Lord continue to mold me and change me Lord let the fear go away Lord oh maybe not today but tomorrow Lord I'm going to need it Lord let not this feeling depart from me then Lord let not this fear come upon me Lord L God I'm going to believe in your word Lord I'm going to trust in you Lord God the Bible says that he has freely given us all things in Jesus Christ he has freely given to us and I'm going to take it Lord I'm going to accept the joy I'm going to accept the freedom that comes being a Christian Lord hallelujah and we're going to give you more of our time I'm throwing away my my excuses lord it's not anybody else it's not that traveler it's me Lord It's Me that allowed that bitterness to come in it's me that allow that condemnation to come in and now Lord I'm offering it on upon the altar of sacrifice and I pray that I allow the Holy Spirit to burn it out of my [Music] heart I thank you Lord God for your mercy and your grace Lord I stick my fear upon the altar as well Lord God lord create in me a clean heart created in me Lord I need you so much more in this day than I've ever needed you before Lord help us Lord to be more of a Christian to

don't need a seven part sermon to teach you how to be happy you know how to do it yes sir so when you start missing that Joy what's wrong there's something wrong in your spirit and that's what David

sometimes we got to get back to do what it meant to be saved amen the feeling in our heart did you feel even a little bit it this morning I hope my testimonies and listen I had to go back for myself this morning too I had to get back to when I was saved again I didn't realize how much I needed it just from a personal standpoint and I hope you did the same thing this morning you went back to some of those old testimonies that you can't explain right you can't understand you may not even you go how that possibly have happened but it did didn't it and here you are proof that it did happen and you can go back and say Lord if you did it then you did it then Lord then you still do it for me today so that's what I meant when I said it's high time to get saved again aren't you glad for his Saving Grace aren't you glad for the grace of almighty God we're so so thankful for it aren't we church amen I'm going to tell you something it's good to say that here but what what I want you to do

okay my God saved me amen you want me to close service okay we're going to go ahead and dismiss you but I'm still going to Worship the Lord a little bit just so you know I feel great this morning I appreciate you all let me be a little bit me this morning because I've been saying how preachers are humans I was a little human to you this morning I needed it myself to get back to get saved again a little bit amen so I just feel like praising the Lord for what he did in my life saving me if you would have seen me 15 years ago you would have said there ain't no chance for that man but God looked at me and said I'm going to make a miracle out of [Applause] him can I say something to your mommy and daddies real quick just so you know this okay sometimes it can be hard those what those kids do they're going to mess up but did you know I was that kid and did you know I had a daddy praying for meise the Lord and did you know my dad had nothing to do with it when I finally got saved there you go and yet he was still praying on me there's one thing I'm I I'm going down this road for a reason one thing you got to make sure you do don't ever doubt God don't ever bring a condemnation Spirit ever Hallelujah there's one thing my dad never did to me me he never condemned me once for anything I did and I mean I did some pretty bad stuff but my dad never condemned me and God was able to fulfill that promise in my life you wonder if God can say because of a daddy's prayer he just preach to you this [Laughter] morning that manifestation of that promise preached to you this morning God don't fail you hearing me God don't fail so take that with you amen I want you to take these with you God don't fail his word amen God don't fail amen you love the Lord let's go bow our heads word of
