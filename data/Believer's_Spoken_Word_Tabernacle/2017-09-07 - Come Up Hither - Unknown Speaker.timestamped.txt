[44:15] that the Lord
[44:17] have given to us for us to gather again
[44:20] this evening
[44:23] um
[44:24] I will start tonight by just uh
[44:29] showing for the world
[44:32] condolence
[44:34] to the entire church
[44:37] because what happened here we got the
[44:40] information back home
[44:42] a personal way of our precious brother
[44:47] James Browning the pastor of the church
[44:50] and uh
[44:51] the congression said I should make sure
[44:54] to extend their condolence to all of you
[44:58] we really sympathize with you
[45:01] and uh
[45:02] just this morning
[45:05] but I some will pick me from
[45:07] Pennsylvania and were coming then
[45:09] he told me also about uh sister Betty
[45:12] the wife of brother Doug in fact it was
[45:16] a blow to me
[45:18] but
[45:19] you know you some when it happened like
[45:22] this you feel some inward pains when
[45:26] especially loved ones you know they go
[45:29] like that
[45:30] but there is a Blessed assurance
[45:33] that that is not the end but surely we
[45:37] have a hope that those loved ones that
[45:40] have gone on we shall see them once
[45:42] again
[45:43] and that is what we are all waiting for
[45:46] and the bible say that we are going to
[45:49] be with them as Jesus Christ is coming
[45:51] to pick all of us away
[45:53] and as we will see him coming so shall
[45:55] we ever be with him with all these loved
[45:58] ones so with once again sympathize with
[46:01] all of you but let us continue to let
[46:03] our faith build up
[46:06] amen because this body
[46:08] must break down
[46:10] Hallelujah and that is what we are all
[46:12] yearning for
[46:14] God bless all of you
[46:15] amen shall we just
[46:19] be on our feet at this time
[46:21] and uh
[46:25] have a word of Prayer
[46:29] dear Lord Jesus Christ
[46:33] today
[46:34] is another day that you have made for us
[46:39] the bible say that we should live in it
[46:41] and rejoice
[46:43] we thank you for what you've made us to
[46:45] be
[46:46] father ignore our mind
[46:49] is not our power
[46:51] it's not anything that we have done by
[46:53] our own selves
[46:54] but it just the grace that you bestowed
[46:57] on us before the foundation of the world
[47:00] We Appreciate You king of kings and Lord
[47:02] of lords
[47:04] I am very thankful Lord unto thee
[47:06] tonight for bringing me safely
[47:08] to brother Samuel an entire congregation
[47:10] here
[47:12] father you promise US that we're two or
[47:15] three will be gathered in your name
[47:17] you'll be right in the midst of your
[47:19] children
[47:20] therefore tonight Lord we pray oh God
[47:23] let us fill your presence O Lord come
[47:26] and speak your word to us father that we
[47:28] may be better people than we have
[47:30] entered in tonight
[47:31] Grant the Lord Jesus Christ and let your
[47:34] word come and heal the sick Lord let it
[47:36] come and roll the burden of your
[47:37] children away
[47:39] we thank you Father and in the end we'll
[47:41] give you glory in adoration
[47:43] we actually Lord in Jesus Christ's name
[47:46] amen
[47:50] shall we just turn our scriptures to
[47:51] Revelation chapter 4.
[47:58] Revelation chapter 4 we read verse 1 um
[48:01] to five
[48:03] and then also
[48:05] we will read chapter 11 verse 11 to 13.
[48:12] Revelation chapter 4.
[48:15] after this I looked and behold the door
[48:18] was opened in heaven
[48:20] and the first voice which I had was as
[48:23] it were of a trumpet talking with me
[48:26] which said come up hither and I will
[48:30] show thee things which must be hereafter
[48:33] and immediately I was in a spirit and
[48:36] behold a throne was set in heaven and
[48:39] one sat on the throne
[48:40] and he that suck was to look upon like a
[48:43] Jasper and a sudden stone
[48:46] and there was a rainbow round above the
[48:48] throne inside like onto an emerald
[48:51] and round about The Throne were Four and
[48:53] Twenty seats and upon the seeds I saw
[48:56] Four and Twenty Elders sitting clothed
[48:59] in white any heart on their
[49:02] heads crowns of gold
[49:03] and out of the throne proceeding
[49:05] proceeded Lightnings and tenderings and
[49:08] voices
[49:09] and there were seven lamps of fire
[49:11] burning Before the Throne which are the
[49:14] seven spirits of God
[49:18] chapter 11
[49:20] verse 11 to 13.
[49:27] and after three days in half the spirit
[49:30] of life from God entered into them and
[49:34] they stood upon their feet and great
[49:36] fear fell upon them which saw them and
[49:38] they heard a great voice from Heaven
[49:40] saying unto them come up hither and they
[49:43] ascended up to heaven in a cloud and
[49:46] their enemies beheld them and the same
[49:49] hour was there a great earthquake in the
[49:51] 10th part of the city fell and the
[49:53] earthquake were slain of men and in the
[49:56] earthquake were slain of men seven
[49:58] thousand and a Remnant were afraided and
[50:01] gave glory to the god of Heaven
[50:04] may the Lord that is blessing to the
[50:06] reading of his word amen shall we take
[50:08] our seat
[50:15] amen we are always grateful to the Lord
[50:19] especially in this time
[50:23] that the world don't know where they
[50:26] have reached
[50:28] uh they don't know what is happening
[50:32] they are just living in the world
[50:35] but we thank God
[50:37] that we know where the world has reached
[50:40] Hallelujah
[50:42] tonight I'm speaking on a topic come up
[50:45] hither
[50:49] come up hither
[50:52] and this this is an invitation
[50:57] and this invitation
[51:00] was God's Own invitation
[51:04] that is Jesus Christ invitation
[51:09] and this invitation
[51:10] a non for any other person
[51:14] but to you
[51:17] Hallelujah
[51:19] that invitation is your invitation
[51:22] and no invitations are meant for so many
[51:25] many reasons
[51:28] no
[51:29] you'll be a very privileged person when
[51:32] somebody will invite you for for dinner
[51:35] because everybody like food
[51:38] oh yes I like it you like it
[51:43] Hallelujah you know so when you are
[51:46] invited for dinner I mean or for a feast
[51:49] you realize that though it means you are
[51:52] very important to that person who is in
[51:53] throwing the invitation to you
[51:56] it showed kind of love
[51:58] if someone loves you he will invite you
[52:03] come and dance with me
[52:05] Hallelujah you know that's the reason
[52:07] why this part of Jesus Christ spoke
[52:10] about the past the man that threw a
[52:13] party and invited some people and they
[52:15] give him excuses it didn't go well with
[52:18] the man
[52:19] because he was such a man that he loved
[52:22] those people he invited them and he
[52:24] prepared
[52:25] you know to to make them happy but day
[52:28] 10 the invitation upside down
[52:32] you know that is why the bible say that
[52:34] he asked his servant to go into the
[52:37] hedges to compel people I mean compel
[52:40] them to come
[52:41] because
[52:42] the feast was meant to be consumed
[52:46] Hallelujah and here we are
[52:49] that God
[52:51] is throwing an invitation to us
[52:54] you see that you're a very important
[52:57] person
[52:58] so long that God is concerned
[53:00] Hallelujah now
[53:03] the prophet made us to understand that
[53:06] John represents the bride
[53:09] and for that matter if John says that
[53:12] he saw
[53:15] when you look up into heaven as he heard
[53:17] the voice called him a door was opened
[53:20] in heaven
[53:21] and the first voice which he had was
[53:24] like a trumpet talking with him which
[53:27] was calling him that John come up either
[53:32] oh my God have mercy
[53:34] I pray that
[53:36] you put yourself in the shoes of John
[53:39] right now
[53:40] for you to realize that that invitation
[53:42] is not for John Baptist for you
[53:45] according as the prophet put it
[53:47] you know
[53:49] and now we know
[53:50] that in the beginning
[53:53] it was the desire of God to live with
[53:56] his people
[53:58] God did not create Adam to separate
[54:01] himself from him
[54:03] God created Adam so that he will have
[54:06] Fellowship always with him
[54:08] that is why the bible say that at the
[54:10] cool of the day the Lord with his sin
[54:13] into the midst of his people and the
[54:16] Lord preached the word because that is
[54:18] whereby we have fellowship with one
[54:20] another
[54:21] he preached a word and they respond amen
[54:24] until sin entered into the Garden of
[54:27] Eden
[54:28] and a separated man completely from God
[54:32] but what happened
[54:34] the originality of God's plan was that
[54:37] he would live with his people
[54:39] so even though sin broke that Fellowship
[54:44] it has always been in the mind of God
[54:46] that he will restore man back to that
[54:48] Fellowship again
[54:50] amen and amen you know like the prophet
[54:52] says that if you hear if you hear and
[54:56] the siren of ambulance rushing somebody
[54:59] to the hospital he said it was because
[55:00] of what the woman did in the Garden of
[55:02] Eden
[55:04] yes sir
[55:05] that brought death
[55:07] because God said that the day that you
[55:10] eat that thing you will die
[55:14] they ate it and they died
[55:17] Hallelujah well you say that but Adam
[55:21] was 930 years yes he was 13 30 years but
[55:25] still he died that same day
[55:29] because when the Lord thousand years
[55:32] it's one day
[55:35] So Adam was not even one day before the
[55:37] Lord
[55:40] Hallelujah
[55:41] but you see anything that the Lord has
[55:45] purpose to do there is nothing that can
[55:47] change his mind
[55:50] here we are now so many problems on the
[55:53] side
[55:55] okay so many problems some summer summer
[55:59] on medication because of what happened
[56:01] in the Garden of Eden
[56:02] some are dying because of what happened
[56:04] in the Garden of Eden some are facing so
[56:07] many problems disaster here or there
[56:11] recently we were there when we had the
[56:13] hurricane whatever they call it that
[56:15] that destroy uh Hustle Princeton I don't
[56:19] know how you pronounce that word
[56:21] amen who's there
[56:23] whatever it was look at what happened
[56:26] now they have once again another one
[56:29] coming
[56:31] and they said it's going to hit the
[56:32] Caribbean and then it is going to turn
[56:34] around and come to Florida
[56:36] what is happening
[56:38] disaster there Hallelujah disaster here
[56:42] disaster there because you know the
[56:44] nature like the prophet said they say
[56:46] the thinking of man has continued to be
[56:49] evil
[56:51] he said the mind the conscious of man
[56:53] has become white like snow or like
[56:56] leprosy you know so when man you know
[56:59] have that thing within him there's
[57:01] nothing good that will come the way of
[57:03] man
[57:05] it's always destruction
[57:07] okay Isaiah say that all tables are
[57:11] filled with vomit
[57:13] there is nowhere clean
[57:15] but what I love is that in the midst of
[57:18] all this in the midst of all this
[57:20] confusion in the midst of all this
[57:22] destruction that is coming up on Earth
[57:24] the Lord has prepared a place for you
[57:27] amen yes sir that is the Blessed assures
[57:30] us that is what settles my heart that
[57:34] after all I know that I'm a Child of God
[57:36] I know that you are a child of God
[57:38] hallelujah so God have prepared a place
[57:40] for you
[57:41] because it has come to a time that God
[57:46] decide that no I can no longer deal with
[57:49] my people again on this act
[57:52] I can no longer deal with them and that
[57:55] was the state that John rich and don't
[57:58] look at he said that done now come up
[58:00] either come up to me now
[58:03] because I am fed up of this world
[58:06] amen you remember
[58:10] in those days when
[58:12] Sodom was filled with sin and
[58:16] you know the bible say that even natural
[58:19] affection loved them
[58:22] and it was so much thinking in the nose
[58:25] of God
[58:27] and God said I know I can no longer stay
[58:29] there let me come and destroy
[58:31] and he came and destroyed the cities
[58:35] Hallelujah
[58:36] and when John also found himself in that
[58:40] situation
[58:42] dot this Antichrist Spirit was so much
[58:46] jeered against him
[58:47] they tried to kill him they tried to
[58:50] destroy him but they tried and tried and
[58:53] tried but the power of God was still
[58:55] vested in John
[58:58] until they banished him to the Island
[58:59] Apartments
[59:00] we all know the story
[59:02] so as the Lord appeared to John on
[59:06] island of Patmos it was a time for God
[59:10] to take him out from the Earth
[59:13] after he showed you whatever he was
[59:15] going to do through the seven Church
[59:16] ages praise the name of our God now he
[59:20] says come up hither and I will show thee
[59:23] things which must be hereafter
[59:27] it means there are still things that God
[59:31] was going to show John
[59:33] and that time he would not allow John to
[59:36] be on this Earth
[59:38] but you must come up
[59:42] Hallelujah he must come a brother sister
[59:45] at this time
[59:47] I say it is time for the bride to go up
[59:52] whether you believe it or not I say
[59:55] tonight it is time
[59:56] for the bride to go up
[59:59] Hallelujah
[1:00:00] look at what is happening in the in the
[1:00:03] in the Middle East now
[1:00:05] you know that the Jews have taken over
[1:00:08] the Temple mount
[1:00:11] yes I think that's July or something
[1:00:13] like that
[1:00:15] they took over the place and they
[1:00:16] hoisted the flag of David over there
[1:00:19] declined the whole world that place
[1:00:21] belonged to them
[1:00:23] and yes it belongs to them too
[1:00:26] that took over the place it must be
[1:00:29] taken up
[1:00:31] you understand that yes because if I
[1:00:34] have a mansion or I have a home and I
[1:00:37] travel and you go and occupy it
[1:00:40] doesn't mean that it belongs to you
[1:00:42] you are just a squatter
[1:00:45] when I come back I have every Power to
[1:00:47] take over my possession
[1:00:49] and that's exactly what is happening now
[1:00:53] and we all know that there's a prophecy
[1:00:55] to be fulfilled
[1:00:57] because that Abomination that make a
[1:01:00] desolate
[1:01:01] standing in the Holy place it must go
[1:01:03] out
[1:01:05] Hallelujah and when it goes out
[1:01:08] what is going to happen
[1:01:11] that is a term that the two prophets are
[1:01:13] going to be up here
[1:01:15] Moses and Elijah
[1:01:18] to do what to reveal Jesus Christ to the
[1:01:21] Jews
[1:01:22] that Jesus Christ that they rejected
[1:01:24] they are going to reveal Jesus Christ to
[1:01:26] them
[1:01:27] and that is where you and I I don't know
[1:01:31] whether we should be here to see that
[1:01:32] then
[1:01:33] remember
[1:01:35] when Joseph decided to reveal himself to
[1:01:38] his brethren
[1:01:40] he hid his wife and children in the
[1:01:43] palace
[1:01:46] so if it is time brother my sister for
[1:01:49] the Moses and the Elijah to appear to
[1:01:51] the Jews then it means the wife of Jesus
[1:01:54] Christ we must go to the Palace
[1:01:58] amen that is why God knew very well that
[1:02:02] John it is time I have to reveal myself
[1:02:04] to my people you cannot be here for me
[1:02:06] to do that so come up
[1:02:09] amen and amen oh what a wonderful time
[1:02:12] brother my sister now we know very well
[1:02:16] that these things are hidden from the
[1:02:19] wise and the prudent
[1:02:22] and it's revealed to us babies
[1:02:26] and the Bible said that every soul
[1:02:28] cement right in the eyes of the Lord
[1:02:31] Hallelujah
[1:02:33] brother my sister it is not something
[1:02:36] that we have studied so much
[1:02:39] it's not something that we paid money
[1:02:41] for
[1:02:43] it's just the grace of God
[1:02:46] hallelujah it's just the grace of God
[1:02:49] our faith is not based upon what we we
[1:02:52] know
[1:02:54] it's built upon the Revelation that God
[1:02:57] gave to us
[1:02:58] and that of Revelation is what we are
[1:03:01] building our faith on
[1:03:02] amen remember where Jesus Christ Paul
[1:03:05] the disciples
[1:03:07] and he asked them a question he said who
[1:03:10] do men say that I am
[1:03:13] and some of them were speechless
[1:03:16] and some say that well they say you are
[1:03:19] Elijah they say you are wanna one of the
[1:03:23] prophets who have come back some say
[1:03:25] that you are Jeremiah and all that Jesus
[1:03:28] said well done
[1:03:30] that is what they are saying but you as
[1:03:34] my disciples what do you see
[1:03:40] amen what do you say are you just
[1:03:44] following me like those group
[1:03:47] who were following me because I fed them
[1:03:50] with food and fishes
[1:03:54] amen some of them were following Jesus
[1:03:57] Christ because of food
[1:03:59] until one day he saw them coming like
[1:04:01] that and he told Peter look they are
[1:04:03] coming because they thought that I'm
[1:04:04] going to give them food again
[1:04:06] Hallelujah
[1:04:09] but he says who do you say I am as my
[1:04:12] disciples
[1:04:14] then the revolution struck Peter
[1:04:16] and he looked to his face
[1:04:18] he said you are the Christ the son of
[1:04:21] the Living God Amen and listen to what
[1:04:24] Jesus Christ said he said Simon
[1:04:28] flesh
[1:04:30] and blood have not revealed this to you
[1:04:32] but my Father which is in heaven has
[1:04:36] revealed this to you and Upon This Rock
[1:04:40] I am going to build my church and the
[1:04:42] death of fire can never Prevail against
[1:04:44] it
[1:04:45] so the Church of Jesus Christ was built
[1:04:48] upon revelation
[1:04:50] amen
[1:04:52] that is why
[1:04:54] we cannot be deceived
[1:04:58] no brother sister we cannot be deceived
[1:05:02] the Antichrist cannot deceive us
[1:05:05] Hallelujah
[1:05:07] we are more than that
[1:05:09] you know that is when John says that he
[1:05:12] saw four beasts around the throne the
[1:05:15] prophet said that these were true gods
[1:05:18] they were guiding the Bride of Jesus
[1:05:20] Christ because the Antichrist is very
[1:05:23] cunning you know he is so deceptive that
[1:05:27] he can change himself and come like a
[1:05:29] like like like he you know
[1:05:31] if they have been able
[1:05:35] to build schools
[1:05:37] if they have been able
[1:05:39] to build hospitals
[1:05:42] if they have been able to send charity
[1:05:44] to places will you say it is bad
[1:05:48] no I don't think so
[1:05:51] because the school that they have built
[1:05:53] our children are attending the schools
[1:05:56] the hospitals that they are built we go
[1:05:59] there for treatment
[1:06:01] Hallelujah they give charity to the poor
[1:06:05] so it is good
[1:06:07] but it's very Kenny
[1:06:10] it's very deceptive
[1:06:12] very deceptive brother says
[1:06:15] if you don't take time you'll be caught
[1:06:16] up into it
[1:06:18] that is why the guides were around the
[1:06:22] throne
[1:06:23] and the Bible called them beasts
[1:06:25] the prophet said it is power
[1:06:29] they caught the attention of the Bride
[1:06:32] to see what the Antichrist is doing
[1:06:35] amen if you build me a screw
[1:06:39] I'll attend the school my children
[1:06:40] attend the school if you build me a
[1:06:42] hospital
[1:06:43] and uh I'll go for there for treatment
[1:06:46] and only to Lead Me to Hell what good
[1:06:49] does that do to me
[1:06:52] what good does that do to me
[1:06:55] Hallelujah so that that the bees were
[1:07:00] there
[1:07:02] creatures
[1:07:04] they are faced like a lion
[1:07:06] like an ox
[1:07:07] like a man like a flying eagle they
[1:07:11] protected the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:07:14] Hallelujah anytime the Antichrist will
[1:07:17] make a move they call the attention of
[1:07:18] the Bride
[1:07:20] come and see
[1:07:24] one time we saw
[1:07:25] the Articles coming with a white horse
[1:07:29] dress in white
[1:07:31] holding a ball without an arrow
[1:07:34] deceiving the people
[1:07:36] and many people thought that it was
[1:07:38] Jesus Christ
[1:07:39] but thank God for the revelation of the
[1:07:41] Seven Seals
[1:07:43] Hallelujah we realize that it was nobody
[1:07:46] but the devil deceiving the people
[1:07:49] because they think that when you wear
[1:07:51] white shirt then you are righteous you
[1:07:54] know white is very clean everybody know
[1:07:55] that what is fine
[1:07:58] like a minister said back home say that
[1:08:02] when your wife is going to kiss you
[1:08:05] ask her what kind of keys is that
[1:08:09] because we have so many kinds of kisses
[1:08:14] some of the kisses are for betrayal
[1:08:19] some are for love
[1:08:22] an example is What Judas is Carrot did
[1:08:25] Jesus Christ
[1:08:28] was the good kiss
[1:08:30] it was case of betrayal
[1:08:34] so if the Antichrist come and kissing
[1:08:37] you say I love you my brother I love you
[1:08:39] my sister ask ask him which which one of
[1:08:43] the kisses is that
[1:08:46] is this for is this for a true love or
[1:08:48] this for betrayer
[1:08:50] or this is a kiss to Lead Me to Hell
[1:08:53] Hallelujah
[1:08:56] Hallelujah the elect cannot be deceived
[1:09:00] and you know he keep changing himself
[1:09:03] as per the spirit that is governing the
[1:09:05] people at that particular time
[1:09:08] until the fourth time when he was coming
[1:09:10] he makes all the colors the bread the
[1:09:13] wine the black and everything so it
[1:09:15] became pale to deceive completely
[1:09:18] but little did he know that at that same
[1:09:21] time God was using the the spirit of the
[1:09:23] eagle
[1:09:28] to see where as far as he saw in the
[1:09:32] skies so clearer you see on the ground
[1:09:34] here
[1:09:35] so anywhere the Antichrist would change
[1:09:38] his color the eyes of the Lord is there
[1:09:41] to see
[1:09:43] praise be the name of our God hallelujah
[1:09:47] amen and amen now so he called he
[1:09:50] invited John to come up to see the thing
[1:09:53] that he was going to do and also to see
[1:09:57] the destruction that was coming upon the
[1:09:59] Earth he said don't come up
[1:10:02] that is what I love he said come up John
[1:10:05] I cannot do this whilst you are on this
[1:10:07] Earth
[1:10:09] I cannot pour destruction on this Earth
[1:10:11] whilst you are here
[1:10:12] so come up from among them
[1:10:16] to where I am
[1:10:18] oh my brother
[1:10:20] and my sister
[1:10:22] I believe
[1:10:24] you have ears to hear right now
[1:10:28] that that invitation is you
[1:10:31] is for you right now that God is calling
[1:10:35] amen
[1:10:37] now these 24 elders
[1:10:40] God willing Sunday if God permit will go
[1:10:42] into that
[1:10:44] into details but let me give just a gist
[1:10:46] of or what I want to put across here is
[1:10:49] it the 24 Elders they fall and they
[1:10:52] watch it
[1:10:53] why did they fall and worship
[1:10:56] they fell and worshiped because
[1:10:59] the ministry of the four living
[1:11:02] creatures
[1:11:04] was made in manifest
[1:11:07] and in the manifestation of their
[1:11:09] Ministry was where the Sons and
[1:11:11] Daughters of God came back to God
[1:11:15] we find out that in the ministry of Paul
[1:11:19] we believe that he used the spirit of
[1:11:21] the Lion
[1:11:22] okay to hold on the check to establish
[1:11:25] the church
[1:11:26] until he was bold enough
[1:11:28] to say what I have laid
[1:11:32] If any man come and change it let him be
[1:11:36] attached
[1:11:38] that was that was Paul
[1:11:40] he was he was so sure he knew very well
[1:11:43] that it was not himself but it was the
[1:11:47] Lord
[1:11:49] he said I didn't come with you with
[1:11:50] enticing west of man's Wisdom
[1:11:53] but I came in the power and the
[1:11:55] demonstration of the Holy Spirit
[1:11:57] therefore the foundation that I have
[1:11:59] laid if anybody come the person should
[1:12:02] make sure that he's building upon that
[1:12:04] same Foundation
[1:12:05] what I've said if I come back and change
[1:12:09] it let me be a cash
[1:12:12] and if any man also come and change it
[1:12:15] even if an angel come from Heaven to
[1:12:17] change it let him be a case
[1:12:20] oh beloved
[1:12:21] you know how many people are cursing
[1:12:23] themselves today
[1:12:27] people say that
[1:12:29] women are also anointed to preach
[1:12:32] women are anointed to be pastors
[1:12:34] do they know that they are cursing
[1:12:36] themselves
[1:12:38] because Paul
[1:12:40] say that a woman cannot be
[1:12:44] and if they say that a woman can be it
[1:12:46] means they are cursing themselves
[1:12:49] Hallelujah
[1:12:51] if Paul say that women should have done
[1:12:53] themselves in mother's apparel
[1:12:56] with Jennifer sadness with sobriety
[1:12:59] and today people say or churches say
[1:13:03] that women that it doesn't matter what
[1:13:05] you wear
[1:13:07] it doesn't matter what you wear but to
[1:13:10] Paul it matters
[1:13:13] therefore the blood testing themselves
[1:13:17] amen
[1:13:19] what are we brother sister where are we
[1:13:21] at now we are in the word of God
[1:13:25] and if you are in the word of God then
[1:13:27] it means we are in God
[1:13:29] we and God we are inseparable
[1:13:33] nothing can separate us from the love of
[1:13:36] God
[1:13:37] that is why Paul says that what shall
[1:13:40] separate me from the love of God what
[1:13:43] nothing
[1:13:44] nothing
[1:13:47] because you are part of God
[1:13:50] and God is part of you
[1:13:53] that is why beloved God can not leave
[1:13:57] you on this Earth
[1:14:00] that is why he's throwing an invitation
[1:14:03] he is throwing invitation to you come up
[1:14:05] here
[1:14:07] before I do what I want to do to
[1:14:08] understand
[1:14:15] perhaps you are the nose of God
[1:14:18] right now as I came
[1:14:21] and you didn't see my nose will you
[1:14:22] recognize me brother Bill
[1:14:24] you wouldn't recognize brother Daniel
[1:14:27] so no there's not a Daniel I know
[1:14:29] that nothing I know he has nose
[1:14:34] Hallelujah
[1:14:36] perhaps when I came my head was not up
[1:14:42] okay
[1:14:43] and how can I come without my head he
[1:14:45] said brother somewhere else oh God we
[1:14:48] have brother Daniel here with us again
[1:14:49] and brother Daniel get up from the back
[1:14:51] and it's coming I don't have a head
[1:14:54] how do you know me that I'm Danielle
[1:14:58] brother
[1:14:59] any road that we play in the Lord
[1:15:03] it was funded before the foundation of
[1:15:05] the world
[1:15:07] God has a purpose for your life in the
[1:15:09] church
[1:15:11] ended being believer in a church you
[1:15:13] have a responsibility to carry out in
[1:15:16] the church
[1:15:18] because you are part of God
[1:15:20] and that part of God nobody can fix it
[1:15:23] you have to fix there
[1:15:26] Hallelujah you have to be on your
[1:15:30] position
[1:15:31] and do as the Lord wants you to do
[1:15:34] hey man
[1:15:37] now let me read this quickly
[1:15:40] from the prophet
[1:15:43] he said after the check Ages was over
[1:15:46] and everything was come ready or made
[1:15:49] ready the setting of the fourth chapter
[1:15:52] here the church edges was was done
[1:15:57] he had done left the Earth
[1:15:59] you see remember
[1:16:01] the voice that spoke to him behind him
[1:16:03] in the serving goddess candlesticks the
[1:16:06] work was finished and now that same
[1:16:09] voice was speaking up in heaven
[1:16:11] what was it he had done redeemed his
[1:16:14] people
[1:16:15] his utterly work was finished and he was
[1:16:18] in glory calling to John come up Higa
[1:16:24] Hallelujah
[1:16:27] I remember
[1:16:29] the prophet said that
[1:16:31] the day that the last bride member would
[1:16:34] believe
[1:16:35] the Rapture will take place
[1:16:40] I wish that he believed right now
[1:16:48] number coming right now
[1:16:53] because the bride is fed up of this
[1:16:56] world
[1:16:59] Hallelujah the world
[1:17:02] any longer
[1:17:05] their ideas has come to an end
[1:17:09] their science is circulating right now
[1:17:12] it's going round they don't have any
[1:17:14] place to go again there's nothing left
[1:17:17] for this word but destruction
[1:17:19] Hallelujah but God will not do that once
[1:17:23] you are here brother sister
[1:17:25] he must call you out from this mess
[1:17:29] to the place that he has prepared for
[1:17:31] issue
[1:17:34] amen
[1:17:35] now the prophet says that he had not
[1:17:38] redeemed his people
[1:17:40] it means he has finished redeeming his
[1:17:43] people
[1:17:44] God is not saving his people he had
[1:17:48] already saved them
[1:17:50] we are not just manifesting we are just
[1:17:53] taking our positions Hallelujah that is
[1:17:56] why our eyes must be open
[1:18:00] our ears must be open our hearts must be
[1:18:04] open to the world
[1:18:06] amen
[1:18:07] his ugly work was finished

[1:18:43] amen and amen
[1:18:47] oh my if they had the voice of the
[1:18:49] trumpet
[1:18:50] notes what John said
[1:18:53] he said
[1:18:55] it was like a trumpet that took with me
[1:18:58] and said come up here
[1:19:01] come up here

[1:19:05] I have shown you the church edges on
[1:19:07] earth now come up here I am going to
[1:19:10] show you something taking place up here
[1:19:13] you see Christ
[1:19:15] had left Earth then
[1:19:18] he has gone up into Glory
[1:19:20] the church Edge was through
[1:19:23] showed that his Spirit was finishing
[1:19:27] and he got into glory and was calling
[1:19:29] for John to come up
[1:19:31] oh glory be to the name of our God
[1:19:35] the work of God is finished on this
[1:19:36] Earth
[1:19:39] I remember the prophet said that we are
[1:19:41] living in a borrowed time
[1:19:43] since from that time
[1:19:45] he said that we are living in a borrowed
[1:19:47] time how long is that borrow time going
[1:19:50] to be about time
[1:19:53] how long
[1:19:56] Hallelujah I said we live as if there we
[1:19:59] have so much years ahead of us it is
[1:20:03] right here now
[1:20:04] the Rapture is hanging on us
[1:20:07] it just hanging on us a circulating
[1:20:09] brothers and sisters don't look far
[1:20:12] look around you that you see the Bears
[1:20:16] of the Rapture hanging over you
[1:20:19] oh God have mercy
[1:20:24] Hallelujah
[1:20:28] that is why
[1:20:31] as believers
[1:20:32] it is time that we should not joke
[1:20:35] with our faith
[1:20:37] as Believers this time that we've got to
[1:20:40] ask ourselves questions
[1:20:43] this is the time
[1:20:45] that you should experience the power of
[1:20:48] God in your life
[1:20:50] by loving one another
[1:20:54] Hallelujah
[1:20:56] will you tell me that a brother step on
[1:20:59] your toe
[1:21:00] and for so many years you could not
[1:21:02] forgive him
[1:21:04] are you sure you can enter into the
[1:21:06] Rapture without sentiment in you
[1:21:12] the prophet says that the only thing
[1:21:14] that is going to make us enter into the
[1:21:15] Rapture is love
[1:21:18] and if my brother step on my toe he must
[1:21:21] just step on my toe and I'm I'm not able
[1:21:24] to act rightly forgive
[1:21:27] and I'm saying that I'm going to the
[1:21:28] Rapture which of the raptures am I going
[1:21:30] to
[1:21:32] which which of them
[1:21:36] Hallelujah
[1:21:38] this is the time brother my sister we
[1:21:41] should come up
[1:21:42] from anything that is drawing us back
[1:21:46] there's a time we should break any link
[1:21:49] of unbelief from us
[1:21:53] this is the time we should take Church
[1:21:55] attendance very seriously
[1:22:01] because their Prophet I always repeat
[1:22:03] that wherever I go
[1:22:05] he said this word that we are feeding on
[1:22:07] it is this same way that will break our
[1:22:10] body
[1:22:11] this word
[1:22:12] it is this word brother
[1:22:14] the power the Heat
[1:22:16] the Dead the night that you come and
[1:22:19] feed on God's word as you keep packing
[1:22:22] the word into your soul that word will
[1:22:24] break your body one of these days
[1:22:27] the Heat
[1:22:28] the heat the heat the anointing the
[1:22:31] power
[1:22:34] Hallelujah yes sir that's some word
[1:22:38] it is God
[1:22:39] who is the word
[1:22:41] because in the beginning was the word
[1:22:43] the Word was God and the Word was God
[1:22:45] and the word become flesh is that not it
[1:22:48] and dwelt amongst us
[1:22:51] sometimes when we say it dwell among
[1:22:53] cash then we think that he is dwelling
[1:22:55] between brother Samuel and my precious
[1:22:57] brother here
[1:22:59] they dwell in your soul
[1:23:03] your soul dwell amongst us
[1:23:06] the heat will break your body
[1:23:10] hallelujah look at the foul
[1:23:14] the foul lay egg
[1:23:17] they're found don't hatch the egg
[1:23:20] you know that
[1:23:22] but the the only thing the foul has to
[1:23:25] do is to make sure it pooped over the
[1:23:27] egg
[1:23:29] so why it brewed over the egg the Heat
[1:23:32] okay from the body the skin you know
[1:23:36] make the the the the air to form
[1:23:39] chickens
[1:23:41] and then it will come to a Time
[1:23:43] the chicken will grow in that shell
[1:23:46] and it could no longer remain over there
[1:23:49] so the chick itself make a way and it
[1:23:52] breaks
[1:23:53] not the handbraking that the eggs
[1:23:57] and that's exactly what we are going to
[1:23:58] do
[1:23:59] that word that word that message of the
[1:24:02] hour the pillar of fire where the glory
[1:24:05] of God is as we pack the word it will
[1:24:08] break our bodies one of these days
[1:24:12] Hallelujah so what can you convince me
[1:24:15] that you can choose to stop coming to
[1:24:18] church you stay at home and feel that no
[1:24:20] brother sister it is not like that the
[1:24:23] bible say that forsake not the Assembly
[1:24:25] of ourselves together
[1:24:28] us it has been the manner of son
[1:24:31] as we see the day approaching I I always

[1:24:58] now
[1:25:00] immediately
[1:25:01] after he showed the end of the age of
[1:25:04] his work year
[1:25:06] he went on up into heaven
[1:25:08] and said
[1:25:09] I will show you what is going to be
[1:25:12] hereafter
[1:25:13] after the church edges
[1:25:16] he said John
[1:25:17] I can't talk to you down there no more
[1:25:21] because I've left them there I've come
[1:25:25] up here so you to come up
[1:25:28] and the prophet said amen
[1:25:30] and I'll show you what is going to take
[1:25:33] place Hereafter oh my
[1:25:35] God he caught up in the vision
[1:25:37] amen
[1:25:39] how dear friend
[1:25:41] when John was caught up and see Jesus
[1:25:44] said write in a book what you have seen
[1:25:48] and give it back
[1:25:50] send it back to the churches
[1:25:53] Paul was forbidden to speak about it
[1:25:55] remember that Paul was caught up into
[1:25:57] the third heavens
[1:25:58] and he was not permitted to to even say
[1:26:01] what he saw
[1:26:02] but when John saw it he was commanded to
[1:26:06] write it in a book
[1:26:07] and send it to the seven churches
[1:26:10] oh Hallelujah it will stand that God was
[1:26:14] revealing himself to his people
[1:26:16] amen and I'm always happy that God put
[1:26:19] me in this age
[1:26:20] Hallelujah where the seals are open and
[1:26:23] the thing that happened in Paul's time
[1:26:25] when poor people didn't understand today
[1:26:27] with good understanding of those things

[1:26:31] opened in our time

[1:27:23] Paul touched on Melchizedek
[1:27:26] but Paul was not able to explain to his
[1:27:30] people
[1:27:33] but we are the prophet in our time
[1:27:37] who told us who Mexico was
[1:27:40] until today the intellectuals
[1:27:43] the right reverence
[1:27:45] the Bishops they don't know even who met
[1:27:48] his other was
[1:27:50] they will argue
[1:27:52] about Melchizedek
[1:27:54] some will say that well he was a man he
[1:27:59] was a king of silent and you see uh you
[1:28:02] see you see they see but they don't see
[1:28:05] anything
[1:28:10] you see you see you see you see
[1:28:14] who was Melchizedek
[1:28:16] who is this America
[1:28:19] Hallelujah
[1:28:21] he has not beginning of days he has no
[1:28:23] end of days
[1:28:25] he are not father he has no mother
[1:28:29] and there is only one that qualifies for
[1:28:31] that and that is God our almighty God
[1:28:34] hallelujah
[1:28:36] Hallelujah you need a prophet to tell
[1:28:39] you this
[1:28:40] other or not you also say you see you
[1:28:44] see
[1:28:45] you see you see but at the end of the
[1:28:48] day you don't see anything
[1:28:52] Hallelujah
[1:28:53] Jesus Christ
[1:28:56] Arceus in this new testament
[1:29:00] so he was in the Old Testament
[1:29:04] same Jesus Christ
[1:29:07] he said Jehovah of the Old Testament is
[1:29:10] Jesus Christ of this new testament
[1:29:13] there's no question about that
[1:29:15] we are serving God by revelation
[1:29:18] and how can you have the Revelation
[1:29:19] without a prophet
[1:29:22] praise be the name of our God
[1:29:24] look at what we are today
[1:29:26] today everything is pointing to one
[1:29:31] thing
[1:29:33] the world is going one way
[1:29:36] and the bride is going another way
[1:29:40] we go where the Lord have designed
[1:29:44] and nobody can stop us
[1:29:48] but their world cannot come the way we
[1:29:50] are going
[1:29:52] Jesus said that the ways are too
[1:29:56] he said one is brought
[1:29:59] and many people there
[1:30:01] are found
[1:30:03] and that leads to destruction
[1:30:06] but there's another one that is very
[1:30:08] narrow
[1:30:09] very narrow way
[1:30:12] and it's few people
[1:30:15] and even a few people we have to be very
[1:30:17] careful because the road is very narrow
[1:30:20] that is why I should make sure that I
[1:30:22] will not step on my brother
[1:30:24] thought even even though by mistake if I
[1:30:27] step on your foot brother Malachi will
[1:30:29] you forgive me
[1:30:30] are you sure you forgive me very well so
[1:30:33] you don't say that well brother Daniel
[1:30:35] step on my foot and say he didn't
[1:30:36] apologize so I'm not I'm not going to
[1:30:38] forgive him
[1:30:39] oh
[1:30:40] no even if I don't do any sign of you
[1:30:44] know you have to forgive me
[1:30:46] it is your duty to forgive me
[1:30:49] I do not mind Beauty to beg you to
[1:30:51] forgive me
[1:30:53] Hallelujah are you catching it now
[1:30:56] you are it's your duty to forgive when I
[1:30:59] offend you
[1:31:02] you have to call my attention even to
[1:31:04] read but Daniel have you seen what
[1:31:05] you've done to me oh brother I'm sorry I
[1:31:08] didn't take note of it
[1:31:10] right now
[1:31:11] but sometimes
[1:31:13] we will not do that
[1:31:15] and we put that within us
[1:31:19] and from that day my brother become my
[1:31:22] enemy my sister become an enemy and you
[1:31:26] say that you are going into the Rapture
[1:31:28] what kind of the Rapture is it
[1:31:32] which one
[1:31:33] which one
[1:31:35] I don't think is this one I'm talking
[1:31:37] about
[1:31:41] amen
[1:31:42] hallelujah okay let me continue a little
[1:31:45] do I have time
[1:31:49] amen
[1:31:51] he says see how the resurrection will be
[1:31:54] it will be in a moment in the window of
[1:31:57] an eye that clears sounding voice and he
[1:32:00] will summon the church calling come on
[1:32:05] that Grace summoning voice oh he said
[1:32:08] God help me to hear it that day
[1:32:12] the prophet said that God help me to
[1:32:14] hear that day
[1:32:15] but today you are hearing it right now
[1:32:19] that sound of invitation is on right now
[1:32:22] God is calling you right now he said
[1:32:25] come up either
[1:32:28] Hallelujah
[1:32:33] the Bible says that
[1:32:37] through one man's sin came into the
[1:32:39] world
[1:32:40] and by one man also
[1:32:43] sin has been taken away
[1:32:47] and that is why we see Jesus Christ
[1:32:50] being our offered General
[1:32:52] leading us in a battle
[1:32:55] that we are fighting in this world
[1:32:59] you see our welfare are not Khanna
[1:33:01] but the almighty through Jesus Christ
[1:33:05] I agree that sometimes many times things
[1:33:08] will come your way
[1:33:10] it's a battle
[1:33:13] it's a battle
[1:33:15] but when the problems come your way when
[1:33:18] the troubles come your way tonight I
[1:33:20] want to advise you don't look to the
[1:33:22] troubles
[1:33:23] don't look to the the problems but look
[1:33:26] to the promises of God
[1:33:28] Hallelujah and there you are much on the
[1:33:31] Conqueror
[1:33:33] you say our they Almighty through Jesus
[1:33:36] Christ
[1:33:38] Mighty through Jesus Christ
[1:33:40] not Mighty through our efforts
[1:33:45] not make it through our Monies
[1:33:49] through our intellectuality
[1:33:51] but it's mighty through Jesus Christ
[1:33:55] so we offer only to look on his promises
[1:33:59] what
[1:34:00] will he do about it
[1:34:03] oh Lord there's my situation father I
[1:34:05] just committed into Almighty hands
[1:34:07] I sit down and see what the Lord is
[1:34:08] going to do
[1:34:10] I used to advise bringing back home that
[1:34:13] sometimes we pray concerning certain
[1:34:16] things and people will be dejected they
[1:34:19] don't even concentrate when they come to
[1:34:21] church because there's a problem there's
[1:34:22] a trouble I know sometimes very
[1:34:24] difficult
[1:34:25] but will you let that thing weigh you
[1:34:27] down
[1:34:29] will you let it go take your faith away
[1:34:32] I said brother you cannot do anything to
[1:34:34] solve that problem
[1:34:36] because if you can do it why don't you
[1:34:38] do it straight away
[1:34:40] you can't do it so what do you think
[1:34:42] about it until sometimes they don't even
[1:34:45] know whether they are in church
[1:34:48] or they are outside
[1:34:53] praise the name of our God
[1:34:55] our God is able
[1:34:58] and more than able
[1:35:00] to do exiting abundantly
[1:35:02] than what we ask
[1:35:05] amen
[1:35:08] now notice oh he finishes work in Earth
[1:35:13] on Earth
[1:35:14] and he has he has taken his church
[1:35:17] and now he sends the judgment
[1:35:21] the world rejected him
[1:35:23] and his son is judgment
[1:35:25] he and his church has gone to Glory
[1:35:29] oh my
[1:35:30] John under Patmos island the revelated
[1:35:33] to the church
[1:35:34] has been the type of the church which is
[1:35:37] lifted up into Glory he said come up
[1:35:39] here
[1:35:40] and I'll show you things hereafter
[1:35:43] oh my you say he represented the church
[1:35:45] yes sir
[1:35:46] to everyone that hears this word
[1:35:50] John represented him
[1:35:53] amen
[1:35:54] John was the representative of the blood
[1:35:56] of Jesus Christ
[1:35:59] testimony of the word
[1:36:01] he was a witness of the baptism of the
[1:36:05] Holy Ghost
[1:36:07] with their personal fellowship with
[1:36:08] Christ
[1:36:10] and he represented the entire church
[1:36:13] that every man
[1:36:16] or woman
[1:36:17] boy or girl
[1:36:20] that ever believed in Christ
[1:36:23] and accept him on the same grounds he
[1:36:26] will be summoned someday
[1:36:31] let me repeat that please maybe you
[1:36:32] didn't hear
[1:36:34] he says
[1:36:36] he was a witness of the baptism of the
[1:36:39] Holy Ghost
[1:36:40] with a personal fellowship with Christ
[1:36:44] and he will presented the entire church
[1:36:46] and that is done
[1:36:49] we are representing Jesus Christ right
[1:36:51] now as we speak here
[1:36:54] we Are Witnesses of the Holy Spirit
[1:36:58] if somebody don't know the Holy Spirit
[1:36:59] you must show the person the Holy Spirit
[1:37:02] because the holy spirit is in you
[1:37:06] amen the holy spirit is in you
[1:37:12] Hallelujah
[1:37:14] we are the representative of the Holy
[1:37:16] Spirit the ambassadors of Heaven
[1:37:20] Hallelujah so he says he represented the
[1:37:24] entire church that every man or woman
[1:37:27] boy or girl that ever believed in Christ
[1:37:31] and accept him on the same grounds he
[1:37:34] will be summoned some of these days
[1:37:37] and I said praise God to that
[1:37:39] because I believe the word
[1:37:42] I believe that someone that Christ gave
[1:37:44] to John
[1:37:45] I believe the entire scripture
[1:37:47] everything that is listed in the word I
[1:37:50] believe it so I become what a believer
[1:37:52] of that word and the prophet is saying
[1:37:55] that boy girl man or woman who believe
[1:38:00] that one of these days he will be
[1:38:03] summoned
[1:38:06] I know you catch it now
[1:38:08] Hallelujah
[1:38:10] so what about right now if you say come
[1:38:12] up either
[1:38:17] come up either right now
[1:38:20] who is going to go
[1:38:22] I am going to go
[1:38:25] Hallelujah and I know you are going to
[1:38:26] go
[1:38:28] nobody will be left here
[1:38:30] why
[1:38:33] because you believe the same thing John
[1:38:36] believed
[1:38:44] amen
[1:38:46] come up hither and he caught up before
[1:38:49] the tribulation
[1:38:50] remember the tribulation time hasn't set
[1:38:52] in yet
[1:38:53] sir
[1:38:55] these are not retribulation
[1:38:57] the hurricanes and whatever whatever
[1:38:59] they call it the tsunamis and they are
[1:39:02] not tribulation
[1:39:04] your tribulation have not set any yet
[1:39:07] we are here
[1:39:09] the holy spirit is here so the
[1:39:12] tribulation cannot set in
[1:39:14] but
[1:39:15] the dirt that the church will be
[1:39:18] ruptured
[1:39:19] we take the holy spirit away from the
[1:39:21] side
[1:39:22] there the Antichrist will help is
[1:39:24] freedom to rule whatever they want to
[1:39:26] rule but that will be our back case
[1:39:29] we don't think about that we think about
[1:39:31] what we are going to see in heaven
[1:39:35] oh brother
[1:39:36] and my sister
[1:39:38] I just want to assure you
[1:39:40] that something has been prepared for you
[1:39:45] and it is for you
[1:39:47] it is for me
[1:39:49] and it's a style
[1:39:51] that will go and enjoy it
[1:39:54] our lovers are not going to be in vain
[1:39:58] Paul says that if people die
[1:40:02] and that is the end
[1:40:04] and the believer also die and that is
[1:40:06] the end then he said that we will be the
[1:40:08] most miserable people
[1:40:11] but there's Blessed assurance
[1:40:14] I said there's a Blessed assurance
[1:40:16] that one of these days the things that
[1:40:19] we have been saying singing about
[1:40:21] singing about talking about preaching
[1:40:24] about we are going to see it reality
[1:40:29] oh brother my sister sometimes there's a
[1:40:32] song Back Home say if I if I have a if I
[1:40:35] have thousand mouth
[1:40:37] and I have thousand tongues
[1:40:40] to sink the glory of God

[1:40:46] the most happiest person on this Earth
[1:40:49] with thousand mouth and thousand times
[1:40:53] to sing the goodness of God to sing
[1:40:56] about Jesus Christ
[1:40:57] Hallelujah brother my sister
[1:41:01] the war has ended
[1:41:04] and we are going to take our Glory
[1:41:07] amen those four living creatures
[1:41:12] the Bible says that
[1:41:15] when they give glory to the Lord
[1:41:18] the 24 elders
[1:41:22] they removed their crowns
[1:41:24] and they Bow Down
[1:41:26] and they worship God
[1:41:28] why will come to that government Sunday
[1:41:33] amen there is a reason for that
[1:41:36] why why would they worship and they sing
[1:41:39] the Praises Thou Art where the Thou Art
[1:41:43] Worthy O Lord
[1:41:46] to receive glory honor and Empire
[1:41:50] father has created all things and for
[1:41:54] thy pleasure they are and were created
[1:41:59] the border and they worship God
[1:42:03] during the ministry of these four living
[1:42:06] creatures
[1:42:08] and all these qualific creatures they
[1:42:11] are Ministry manifested within the seven
[1:42:14] Church edges
[1:42:17] you understand so therefore anytime a
[1:42:21] Ministry go off
[1:42:22] it gather the children of God
[1:42:24] anytime a mystery is graffiti it gather
[1:42:27] the children of God anytime a mission is
[1:42:30] revealed he gathered to the children of
[1:42:31] God until the seventh consecutive Church
[1:42:33] against was fulfilled
[1:42:35] and now God have his bride
[1:42:38] ready
[1:42:40] for the goal
[1:42:42] amen
[1:42:43] and it is the Joy or the desire of these
[1:42:48] 24 Elders to see to it that the ministry
[1:42:52] of Christ has been made manifested
[1:42:55] that's the reason why they were
[1:42:58] rejoicing
[1:43:00] amen remember
[1:43:03] that when John opened saw the book open
[1:43:06] and he found out that his name was in
[1:43:09] the book didn't he shout he shouted
[1:43:13] he shouted and the Bible said that
[1:43:15] immediately at the 24 others saw the
[1:43:17] book open then the bow down and they
[1:43:20] worshiped God
[1:43:21] yes because the Bride of Christ's name
[1:43:24] was going to be mentioned
[1:43:28] and they served the Lord
[1:43:31] and if you serve the Lord you must serve
[1:43:33] the queen
[1:43:36] Hallelujah you see why they were
[1:43:39] rejoicing oh I don't want to run God
[1:43:41] willing we are going to go into things
[1:43:44] amen but my joy tonight for you is
[1:43:47] brother
[1:43:48] I see that you are part of the
[1:43:50] invitation
[1:43:52] you are part of the invitation
[1:43:54] that invitation that Jesus Christ have
[1:43:56] thrown
[1:43:57] I say you are part of it
[1:44:00] therefore why don't you honor that
[1:44:03] invitation
[1:44:06] one thing one thing for somebody to
[1:44:08] invite you and it's another thing for
[1:44:10] you to honor the invitation
[1:44:12] Hallelujah the most important thing is
[1:44:16] the honoring of the invitation
[1:44:20] because if you don't honor the
[1:44:21] invitation what will happen perhaps the
[1:44:23] person who waste every effort to prepare
[1:44:27] something for you
[1:44:29] you understand that
[1:44:31] that is why in this end time brother and
[1:44:33] sister right now as we are living we
[1:44:36] must be very very careful of any step
[1:44:38] that we take as Christians
[1:44:41] my advice tonight
[1:44:44] assess your life
[1:44:48] I believe all of us will be Christians
[1:44:50] brother I believe all of us to be
[1:44:52] Believers my sisters
[1:44:54] the prophets say that we have three
[1:44:55] kinds of Believers yes I know that I
[1:44:57] believe that
[1:44:58] but whom am I going to point finger that
[1:45:00] you are an unbeliever
[1:45:02] or you are a believer and this one is I
[1:45:05] mean who can do that
[1:45:07] no brother all of us we see ourselves as
[1:45:09] Believers and for that matter my advice
[1:45:13] is that check everything that is within
[1:45:15] you
[1:45:16] anything that you know is going to be a
[1:45:18] hindrance
[1:45:19] for your goal as per the invitation put
[1:45:23] it aside
[1:45:25] don't let anything hinder your movement
[1:45:28] don't carry any weight to suppress you
[1:45:32] be lighter brother sister be light take
[1:45:35] every get this thing away from you
[1:45:39] amen
[1:45:43] it's just the grace of God
[1:45:45] that we are all Christians
[1:45:49] we didn't fend for it
[1:45:52] and sometimes
[1:45:53] people think that when we say grace uh
[1:45:57] Grace is that well Jesus have saved me
[1:45:59] so for that matter I can do anything
[1:46:01] that I want no Paul says that God forbid
[1:46:04] it
[1:46:07] God forbid it Grace is something that
[1:46:10] you ought to do but you are not able to
[1:46:12] do and somebody do it for you
[1:46:17] if I come and meet a very big gutter and
[1:46:20] I cannot cross over
[1:46:22] and I stand there I'm crying who helped
[1:46:24] me crossover
[1:46:26] and perhaps I see somebody come
[1:46:30] a very big giant
[1:46:31] he has long legs to cross over
[1:46:35] and then he will take me by my hand and
[1:46:38] move me across
[1:46:39] wouldn't I be happy
[1:46:41] I'll be very happy
[1:46:44] I will be very happy and I think I'll
[1:46:46] never even think of going by that way
[1:46:48] again
[1:46:50] that is what Christ has done for us
[1:46:53] we were born in sin we worshiped in
[1:46:57] iniquity that is why we came to this
[1:46:59] world lying doing so many things that
[1:47:02] were not you know enough you know good
[1:47:04] to do but the grace of God Rich us
[1:47:08] and God brought us to himself and God
[1:47:11] washed us and he made us clean
[1:47:14] Hallelujah
[1:47:16] that is why the angels and the 24 Elders
[1:47:20] were praising God
[1:47:22] they were praising God because of you
[1:47:24] because that you have believed on the
[1:47:27] Lord Jesus Christ they were praising God
[1:47:30] the Bible said that when a soul come to
[1:47:32] the Lord
[1:47:34] Heaven the angers Go Happy
[1:47:37] and they sing praises and they praise
[1:47:39] your brother sister right now because of
[1:47:41] you go and see heaven
[1:47:44] they are rejoicing
[1:47:46] they are praising they are magnifying
[1:47:48] God that is why you don't have to let
[1:47:52] them down
[1:47:56] don't let them down
[1:47:58] Let the Praises go on in heaven
[1:48:01] any step that you take it sounds holy in
[1:48:05] heaven
[1:48:06] because we're a holy Child of God
[1:48:09] Let It Go on that way
[1:48:11] and I'm looking to that day
[1:48:14] when all will be well
[1:48:18] and who all will be someone
[1:48:20] the Bible said that we are going to sing
[1:48:22] new song
[1:48:24] Hallelujah I said a new song
[1:48:27] and the angels will not even have any
[1:48:30] idea about it
[1:48:33] they will not understand
[1:48:36] we are going to sing about our
