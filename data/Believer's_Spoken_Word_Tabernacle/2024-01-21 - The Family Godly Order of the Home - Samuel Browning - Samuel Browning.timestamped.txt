[36:44] services I walked over last Sunday
[36:47] evening after Brother Kyle Nicholson was
[36:49] sitting there from Brother Paul's and I
[36:50] walked over and I said Brother Kyle I

[37:29] in a word of prayer and we certainly
[37:31] want his guidance

[37:35] Father Lord we just want to say that we
[37:38] love
[37:39] you we appreciate you
[37:42] Lord and we lord just are so
[37:47] thankful God that you have allowed us
[37:50] Lord to where that we can gather
[37:52] together here this
[37:54] morning brothers and sisters of like
[37:56] precious
[37:57] Faith Lord there's one there's one goal
[38:00] there's one
[38:02] desire that we would have and that is
[38:05] Lord we want to see
[38:07] you Lord our desire is to stand there
[38:11] Lord that our lives would
[38:13] be on that moment Lord of The Rapture to
[38:18] be changed Lord from Mortal to
[38:21] immortality our hearts Lord are longing
[38:25] Lord for that moment moment Lord oh God
[38:30] may you just Lord once again this
[38:33] morning may we take a another step
[38:36] higher Lord may you come and just speak
[38:41] Lord to our hearts what we have need of
[38:44] Lord there's things that you've laid on
[38:46] my heart through study and meditation
[38:50] prayer but Lord it will take you to
[38:52] bring it it'll take you to put it all
[38:55] together Lord
[38:57] I'm asking Lord that the same
[38:59] inspiration that dropped with just the
[39:01] simpleness of the thought I want to
[39:04] follow you father that's the greatest
[39:08] privilege that I've ever had Lord is to
[39:12] be led by you
[39:14] father as Sons and Daughters of God
[39:17] that's a privilege
[39:20] Lord oh God may we just lay aside Lord
[39:23] now all of our thoughts and lay aside of
[39:26] all the cares of the world because we
[39:28] can't solve them right now anyhow but I
[39:31] believe father that you can give such an
[39:35] assurance Lord you can give an answer
[39:39] you can give us peace Lord in every area
[39:43] and over every decision now may you just
[39:46] come I pray Lord be the speaker and
[39:48] hearer may you minister to every need
[39:50] those that are even not able to be here
[39:52] this morning would you just minister to
[39:55] their needs Lord I hear that Lord with
[39:57] sister Michelle and the foot Lord you
[40:00] know the battle that's been there Lord
[40:02] where times that infection Lord has
[40:04] wanted to travel from the foot up the
[40:06] leg and Lord how that you've intervened
[40:09] Lord time and time again and we're just
[40:12] asking for your mercy once again Lord
[40:14] that you would move Lord for our sister
[40:16] move for the other needs some Lord that
[40:19] oh God that you see Lord not here this
[40:22] morning Lord I just ask that you would
[40:24] move for their needs Lord we pray in a
[40:26] special way come and Lord help us now in
[40:30] the name of Jesus Christ amen amen God
[40:34] bless you amen musicians
[40:38] and the songs My just
[40:41] wonderful um Psalms
[40:45] 127 and uh I just want to read through
[40:49] that scripture or that
[40:51] chapter Psalms
[40:55] 127
[41:09] a song of degrees for
[41:12] Solomon except the Lord build the house
[41:16] they labor in vain that build it and
[41:20] except the Lord keep the city The
[41:23] Watchman waketh but in vain
[41:27] now notice in all in both of these parts
[41:30] of this scripture unless it's the Lord
[41:33] who's building it unless it's the Lord
[41:36] who's keeping the city now I certainly
[41:39] believe that and I believe we agree
[41:41] together that he is the author and the
[41:44] finisher he's the one who is who builds
[41:48] his church he said Upon This Rock I will
[41:50] build my church and I certainly believe
[41:53] I believe we do together that he is also
[41:56] the the one that directs us on areas
[41:59] that need to be
[42:00] kept and without him we would be in a
[42:03] heap of
[42:05] trouble and we certainly need him verse
[42:08] two it is vain for you to rise up early
[42:12] to sit up late to eat the bread of
[42:15] Sorrows for so he giveth his beloved
[42:18] sleep that's connected with that first
[42:20] verse Lo children are inheritage of the
[42:24] Lord and the fruit of the womb is his
[42:28] reward as arrows are in the hand of a
[42:31] mighty man so are children of the youth
[42:35] and happy is the man that hath his
[42:38] quiver full of them as I've said before
[42:42] I've got a quiver on my compound bow
[42:45] that holds six arrows and I've got a
[42:48] quiver on my crossbow that holds
[42:51] three seems like my quiver was
[42:55] three
[43:00] they shall not be
[43:02] ashamed but they shall speak with the
[43:06] enemies in the gate if the Lord would
[43:09] help us here this morning I'd like to
[43:10] speak on the family and godly order of
[43:13] the home may God bless you and bless the
[43:16] word as we're being seated I sometimes
[43:21] uh you uh can really wrestle sometimes
[43:25] the way that the thought itself
[43:26] originally comes um and I just maybe a
[43:29] little insight here and you just have to
[43:31] take my word for it that sometimes it's
[43:33] the thought of it that and how that it
[43:35] comes and how that the Lord will drive
[43:38] and direct the thought and actually
[43:40] doesn't end up being the title but it
[43:43] ends up being the underlying theme
[43:45] within it and though the title itself is
[43:48] The Godly order of the home because
[43:49] we're going to deal with a lot of things
[43:51] with order Blueprints and things like
[43:54] that but there's the word that I don't
[43:56] know how extensively that I'll go into
[43:58] it here this morning but a word that has
[44:00] just been moving in my heart and that's
[44:03] the word of
[44:04] passion uh because anything that we uh
[44:08] there's there's something that every one
[44:10] of us are passionate about and you know
[44:14] you just if we we sit down and we we
[44:16] talk about it and I just as I was
[44:19] fellowshipping with a brother here the
[44:20] other day on the phone and uh just uh
[44:24] some things are being shared and some
[44:26] things and I said you know it's one of
[44:28] those things that as we set and we talk
[44:31] it's it's something that you know you
[44:33] can talk a little bit about this and you
[44:35] could talk a little bit about this and
[44:37] let me just use example with um with
[44:39] brother Joey and sometimes where brother
[44:41] Joey's been here and I've come out of
[44:42] the office and in the earlier parts of
[44:44] the hunting season and I come out
[44:46] sometimes to catch him when he's coming
[44:48] out of the woods and and you know I'll
[44:50] ask him you seeing anything back there
[44:52] or you know what's going on you know and
[44:55] uh and then you know we'll go from
[44:57] talking about deer CU we we both like
[44:59] deer hunting and then it'll get around
[45:01] to uh talking about the Lord and it
[45:03] isn't something that we've had to
[45:05] program and brother Joey says oh now the
[45:07] alarms went off we've spent 10 minutes
[45:09] on deer hunting and now it's time to
[45:12] talk 20 minutes uh on the things of the
[45:14] lord it's just it's natural to gravitate
[45:17] to those things because within it all
[45:20] there's a lot of things that interest
[45:22] that we might have and a lot of things
[45:24] that we can even have passion about but
[45:27] if the very source and what would be the
[45:31] center of our life if the passion is not
[45:34] the things of God then the order itself
[45:38] is wrong and so we all we want we know
[45:41] that that with the passion itself it's
[45:44] uh it's something that we certainly uh
[45:46] know that we must have and I I believe
[45:49] that a passion itself it'll it'll
[45:51] certainly come from an absolute um but I
[45:54] wanted to read this this statement that
[45:56] brother Bram makes here within a home
[45:59] and as he says this in the life story
[46:01] and he's talking about his from his own
[46:03] home he says home is not the house it's
[46:07] the order of the house that makes the
[46:10] home that's what makes home no matter if
[46:13] it's a shanty whatever it is if the
[46:16] order is right on the inside and godly
[46:21] it's more of a home than if you had a
[46:24] palace somewhere right said I'd rather
[46:26] live in a shanty and be happy than to
[46:28] live in a palace and be
[46:32] unhappy and I think that we can we can
[46:35] agree to that we might want different
[46:37] things and look at things but to realize
[46:40] that uh no more than it's the suit that
[46:42] makes the preacher it's not the home
[46:45] itself or the house that actually makes
[46:48] it home there can be many houses
[46:51] themselves it can be a house that might
[46:54] be very attractive on the the outside
[46:56] and the way it looks but it might be
[46:58] very cold on the inside and so the very
[47:00] thing itself that separates and what
[47:03] really makes it a home is that of the
[47:06] order and that it's Godly on the inside
[47:09] aside everything else from the cares of
[47:11] the world and and of this life and we
[47:14] aside everything else from the cares of
[47:16] the world and and of this life and we we
[47:19] work to keep it in a place like that
[47:21] that is a reverence that a place that
[47:23] God will come and speak to our Liv lives
[47:26] because there is a value in our hearts
[47:29] that goes beyond just this life and what
[47:31] we see we realize this life is really
[47:34] not about this life this life is about
[47:38] that life that's coming and so to
[47:40] capture that and to see that how within
[47:44] a household and I I think to set it in
[47:46] this manner here that if we look at in
[47:49] our lives and I I would say this like as
[47:51] Sons and Daughters of God that we uh
[47:54] recognize that it's something that God
[47:57] the way that if God would spend such uh
[48:00] such detail on order within his house
[48:03] Paul would write of it in Timothy God
[48:06] would send his prophet in this hour and
[48:08] speak to you and I even on things within
[48:11] Church order and things that you know I
[48:14] was not even aware of until I I stood
[48:16] there and the brother was taking us
[48:18] through uh the brandom Tabernacle there
[48:21] and we spent about two hours with that
[48:23] brother and they were talking about some
[48:25] things that when you hear Brother Bram
[48:26] talking about not talking in the
[48:29] sanctuary and other things like that you
[48:31] come to find out that those things were
[48:33] going on when the when the Tabernacle
[48:35] itself even when things first were being
[48:38] built and went on for a period of time
[48:40] but there were adjustments that were
[48:41] made there and those were things I
[48:43] didn't know I didn't know about but you
[48:44] see what it was is there's adjustments
[48:46] of things that brother Bram himself he
[48:49] began to see and begin to make and begin
[48:51] to Value remember because you know how
[48:54] it is if if we're just talking about
[48:56] every sort of thing before you come into
[48:57] the house of God you can't just come
[48:59] into the house of God and turn on a
[49:01] switch uh those are things that you know
[49:04] there's a preparation I just had a
[49:06] individual share with me here the other
[49:08] day and say you know I see and I note a
[49:10] difference when there is a moment that I
[49:12] can just have on some instrumental music
[49:15] and just have some prayer before I enter
[49:17] into the house of God there's a
[49:18] difference and I I believe we've come
[49:21] here for with a real desire we listen
[49:24] we've not just come here just to fill a
[49:26] block of time we've not just come here
[49:28] just merely because it's a duty we've
[49:30] come here to receive from God we we want
[49:34] we want our lives as it were it's like
[49:36] updates on your phone that sometimes
[49:38] they need to be done in order to prevent
[49:42] bugs that are there in order to prevent
[49:44] uh security breaches and other things I
[49:47] believe that's what the spirit of God
[49:49] comes to speak to our lives because
[49:51] there is a continual building and a
[49:54] growing that's going on on it isn't so
[49:56] much of of ourself that's being built
[49:59] it's actually us being torn down so that
[50:02] he might be built up in our lives so you
[50:05] have except the Lord build the house and
[50:07] that's why when the spirit of God comes
[50:09] and deals with our life we're here
[50:11] together that we want to grow in the
[50:14] things of God I my heart's desire is
[50:16] that God himself that his life would
[50:19] just growing in my life in our lives
[50:21] together and so this is where it comes
[50:24] in to accept the Lord build the house
[50:26] they that labor labor in vain unless God
[50:29] comes and he is the one speaking to our
[50:31] hearts and there's something in our life
[50:33] that just surrenders to him and don't
[50:36] try to figure it out Just Surrender and
[50:37] say Lord be it unto me according to Thy
[50:40] word and I'm just going to lay upon that
[50:42] Lord I'm going to lay myself before you
[50:45] in that area that you've spoken to me so
[50:48] personally until that that area I see
[50:52] God flowing through my life that's how
[50:55] God builds his church and that's also
[50:58] how the holy spirit will warn Us in the
[51:02] gates of our life and helping us to see
[51:05] that there's some gates that we need to
[51:07] kind of pick up on there's encroachments
[51:09] of the enemy there's things that's out
[51:12] there and unless God keeps the city my
[51:15] it would go I mean it could slip right
[51:16] under the cover as the prophet told us
[51:19] in the first seal he speaks of that
[51:21] Antichrist Spirit he said as far as in
[51:23] our smarts he can out do any of us but
[51:26] he said there's one that he cannot outdo
[51:30] sir and that's the Holy Ghost what a
[51:32] comfort that is to us as Believers So
[51:36] within that of a household for God I
[51:38] certainly believe that not only uh we
[51:41] look at it for this this place here but
[51:43] I believe in a household for God Even in
[51:45] our own homes we look at it that there's
[51:47] three things I just want to mention it'd
[51:49] be a place where the holy spirit is
[51:51] always welcome I think that's up there
[51:54] on the slide a Place separate from Sodom
[51:57] a place where preparations are made to
[52:01] leave this world so that's the whole
[52:04] that's the whole purpose of what's going
[52:05] on inside of our household where the
[52:08] holy spirit is always welcome amen amen
[52:13] it's separate from
[52:15] Sodom and it's a place where
[52:17] preparations are made to leave this
[52:20] world brother Brandon when he walks back
[52:22] into the Tabernacle in the time of
[52:24] dedication he says I certainly deemed
[52:26] this one of the highlights of my life to
[52:28] be in the Tabernacle again this morning
[52:31] to see its beautiful structure and the
[52:34] Order of the children of God setting in
[52:37] his house today and it goes on to say
[52:40] and I always wanted to see a place
[52:42] correctly in order and for God to
[52:45] worship with his people and we can only
[52:48] do that not by a pretty building but by
[52:52] a consecrated life is the only way we
[52:57] can do
[52:59] that so it's it's not I mean we
[53:02] appreciate the structure I believe with
[53:04] all my heart that uh we want to do the
[53:07] very best that we can do not only to
[53:09] keep it up but in any way of what we can
[53:11] do because I certainly believe that
[53:14] whatever if there's things we do or we
[53:16] don't do it speaks of what we think of
[53:18] the Lord sure does brother Bram himself
[53:21] when he talked about the way the
[53:23] Tabernacle went and not in the building
[53:25] of and things like that he says it shows
[53:26] what they thought of the ministry so
[53:29] it's very important the things that we
[53:31] do I he not talking about himself but
[53:33] he's talking about the ministry that God
[53:34] has given and so I think it's very
[53:36] important that we understand that
[53:37] there's things that it's it's that the
[53:40] value that we have and I'm thankful that
[53:42] God's given us a place I remember back
[53:45] in the days when we had to pack things
[53:46] up and pack and pack them and take them
[53:48] down I remember stretching speaker wire
[53:50] into different uh rooms in order for
[53:53] people to be able to hear over there on
[53:54] G Avenue we had people sitting in the
[53:56] nursery the car the I remember that and
[53:59] I remember having to get there sometimes
[54:01] the other church was a little later
[54:02] getting out and that's okay I mean and
[54:05] that we're renting from and we'd have to
[54:06] get in there and you know carrying the
[54:08] speakers putting them on the the post
[54:10] and the stands and I think you know
[54:11] brother brother Elmer Dalton he welded
[54:14] those stands that we had and made him to
[54:16] fit in that building and then we had
[54:18] wires and some of you remember that we
[54:20] had wires and running it and then after
[54:22] the end of the service wonderful service
[54:24] well you had to have strength to take
[54:26] them big speakers down and pack
[54:28] everything up I'm really thankful that
[54:31] God's given us a place that when there's
[54:33] a burden on our heart to have a meeting
[54:35] we don't have to ask somebody and say
[54:37] you think we can have Friday night or
[54:38] Saturday night I think it's a blessing
[54:40] that God has given us a place where we
[54:43] can have have Services when we want to
[54:46] and even be able to host meetings and
[54:49] let others and invite others to come in
[54:52] I think that's a great blessing it's not
[54:53] to make us something but I look at it if
[54:56] God's given us something then let's use
[54:58] it for the kingdom of
[55:00] God so as he said the only way we can do
[55:04] this is not by a pretty building but by
[55:06] a consecrated life so I really I think
[55:09] as we can hone in upon that and and to
[55:12] understand there are are blueprints
[55:14] anytime you do any sort of building you
[55:17] know there's there's blueprints you've
[55:18] got to go by um you know those have to
[55:21] be approved those drawings got to be
[55:23] approved by the city and or Township
[55:26] whomever it is that you're going by and
[55:28] then then you have to abide by those
[55:30] blueprints you you can't get blueprints
[55:33] approved downtown at the city of
[55:35] Lorraine and then you have an approval
[55:37] for a ranch and then all of a sudden you
[55:39] decide you know what I think I'd like to
[55:41] make a Colonial House twostory it don't
[55:43] work that way or to say you know what I
[55:46] think you know what we're going to do
[55:47] we're going to change and move the
[55:48] garage from this side to this side no
[55:50] you got to stay with the blueprints
[55:52] that's been submitted and I'll just say
[55:55] say it like this God has not asked you
[55:57] or I to come up with the
[56:01] blueprints that's been sometimes that's
[56:03] been the problem down Through the Ages
[56:05] where they've taken something out of the
[56:07] scripture and said this is the blueprint
[56:09] but the problem is it don't line up with
[56:11] the rest of God's word that's right you
[56:14] see if we if we even take a scripture
[56:16] let me give you an example like the
[56:18] Pentecostal say well you know here it
[56:20] was when the Holy Ghost fell they spake
[56:22] in tongues and they want to take that
[56:23] scripture and make it absolute the
[56:26] problem with that you might have a
[56:27] scripture but it doesn't hold continuity
[56:31] with the rest of the scripture and God's
[56:34] thought is not something that is broken
[56:37] into pieces it is a
[56:42] continuity yes sir so a blueprint God
[56:45] himself sets us sets the blueprint for
[56:48] you and I brother bam when he would
[56:50] speak marriage of the Lamb
[56:52] 1962 he says we have have the material
[56:56] on Earth to make the bride ready yes
[57:00] amen and that material is the word that
[57:04] material is the spirit of the Living God
[57:08] and so when we think of that blueprint I
[57:11] want to just read this to you out of 1
[57:13] Chronicles 28:9 because the Psalms we
[57:15] read it's speaking it's an expression of
[57:18] not only that to Solomon I love that a
[57:21] song of degrees there's we I believe
[57:23] there's higher Heights in God
[57:25] and thou Solomon my son know thou the
[57:29] god of thy father and serve him with a
[57:33] perfect perfect means
[57:35] complete that's what perfect means
[57:37] because you can't be perfect I can't be
[57:39] perfect than myself but we want to be
[57:41] complete you say well what do you mean
[57:43] by complete that means that when I'm
[57:45] conviced and conviction comes and I'm
[57:47] wrong I want to be complete and say Lord
[57:50] forgive me I don't want to give no place
[57:52] to the enemy that's right and with a
[57:55] willing mind for the Lord searcheth all
[57:59] hearts and understandeth all the
[58:01] imaginations of the thoughts if thou
[58:04] seek Him He will be found of thee but if
[58:07] thou forsake Him He will cast thee off
[58:10] forever now watch this take heed now for
[58:13] the Lord hath chosen thee to build an
[58:16] house for the sanctuary be strong and do
[58:20] it I don't know about you but I always
[58:22] find this incredibly interesting when
[58:25] God is calling us to do something he
[58:28] follows it and with an admonition be
[58:31] strong and do
[58:32] it it lets you and I know it's going to
[58:36] take more than just our human
[58:40] resiliency our human strength because
[58:44] even as the book of Isaiah said even the
[58:48] youth will grow
[58:50] weary even the youth will faint so even
[58:54] though young people people have such
[58:55] strength and man stamina and you know
[58:59] are able just to go and uh but yet God
[59:02] says even in this part your human
[59:05] strength alone is not enough to achieve
[59:10] the purpose of God and to stand that so
[59:13] good it's going to take his strength
[59:16] moving behind your strength and God
[59:19] wants to use your strength as a young
[59:21] person he wants to use the stamina
[59:23] that's why the Bible say said what a
[59:25] blessing it is for the Youth to Bear the
[59:28] the uh the Yoke in their youth
[59:30] Hallelujah right it's a blessing for
[59:33] that to take the strength and to have
[59:35] that stamina but yet we want to make
[59:37] sure that it's under the strength and
[59:40] the governance of almighty
[59:42] God be strong and do it so what a what a
[59:45] charge for Solomon then David here's
[59:48] what I want you notice this in verse 11
[59:50] then David gave to Solomon his son the
[59:53] pattern and he gave him the pattern of
[59:56] all of these things go down to verse 12
[59:59] and the pattern of all that he had by
[1:00:02] the spirit of all of these other things
[1:00:05] and so the pattern itself this was not
[1:00:08] something that David it had been become
[1:00:11] like you know well Mama thought this and
[1:00:14] daddy thought this and we'll just put
[1:00:16] this together and we'll we'll see what
[1:00:17] no David what he was passing to Solomon
[1:00:22] was something that had been revealed to
[1:00:24] him by the spirit and what he was
[1:00:27] admonishing Solomon is Solomon you've
[1:00:31] got to have the same experience what God
[1:00:33] has given me you yourself must receive
[1:00:37] this pattern and it be revealed to you
[1:00:40] by the spirit that this is absolute
[1:00:43] don't cut any Corners don't make any
[1:00:46] adjustments to it just stay with it even
[1:00:49] when it seems like it doesn't make sense
[1:00:53] stay with it amen why because if you
[1:00:56] build a house and you don't build it
[1:00:58] according to the blueprint you're going
[1:01:01] to have to tear it down and start all
[1:01:04] over is that right so it's got to be
[1:01:07] built according to the blueprint First
[1:01:11] Kings chapter 10 now let's let's just
[1:01:13] make kind of a Quantum Leap here to this
[1:01:15] place of here is Solomon and here's a
[1:01:18] here is Solomon after uh the house of
[1:01:21] the Lord has been built 7even years in
[1:01:23] building the house of of the Lord and
[1:01:25] then he built his own house which was 13
[1:01:28] years in building it I want you to
[1:01:30] notice though I want you to notice the
[1:01:32] priority that Solomon himself his
[1:01:35] priority was upon God's house first his
[1:01:39] own house
[1:01:41] second am are you hearing me he didn't
[1:01:45] build his own house and say well once I
[1:01:47] get my house built then I'll focus on
[1:01:49] the house of God sometimes the things
[1:01:52] God asked us to do do not make sense our
[1:01:57] order of because our order of thinking
[1:02:00] is is that let me get rid of this and
[1:02:02] let me get out of this and let me do
[1:02:03] this and then I'll serve God you got to
[1:02:06] come back to realize why is the mess the
[1:02:09] first place that it is you don't get out
[1:02:11] of a mess or out of a situation by
[1:02:14] resting on the arm of flesh on your own
[1:02:16] abilities on your own way to figure
[1:02:18] things out because that's what happened
[1:02:20] in the first place you've got to put God
[1:02:23] first and when God is first then God can
[1:02:26] bring everything else around the way
[1:02:29] that it ought to
[1:02:32] be yes
[1:02:34] sir so here here is Solomon and notice
[1:02:38] the Queen of Sheba from from such a
[1:02:41] distance the Bible speaks that she's
[1:02:44] heard of what's taking place and the
[1:02:47] Bible says it like this and when the
[1:02:49] Queen of Sheba had seen all of Solomon's
[1:02:52] wisdom and the house that he had built
[1:02:54] now think about remember brother Trevor
[1:02:56] was he was uh who was he talking to was
[1:02:58] he talking to you about you're a house
[1:03:00] Builder and you're saying I'm a house
[1:03:02] Builder and and you know you think about
[1:03:04] and he said okay he said so where's the
[1:03:06] where where's the
[1:03:10] fruit where's the fruit remember he was
[1:03:12] preaching on that in the morning of the
[1:03:14] all
[1:03:14] alone so it it's same things that this
[1:03:18] wasn't just something that was said but
[1:03:21] what was said it it was something that
[1:03:24] moved in her heart of the testimony of
[1:03:27] others that had been there and so it
[1:03:30] wasn't just something of the imagination
[1:03:33] it was a reality so when these people
[1:03:36] were expressing this of what they
[1:03:38] witnessed what they saw taking place she
[1:03:42] came and she saw it
[1:03:45] right and I believe I believe we believe
[1:03:48] together that serving the lord it's
[1:03:51] something where it ought to be listen
[1:03:53] the token the life of God the Holy
[1:03:56] Spirit the love of God all the same is
[1:03:58] something that should show coming and
[1:04:02] going it shows in office
[1:04:05] life it shows in school life but Sam
[1:04:09] what are you saying I'm saying that we
[1:04:11] don't take off or just uh take off
[1:04:14] serving God and hang it up for Sunday or
[1:04:17] hang it up for Thursday but serving the
[1:04:19] lord I'm saying this in a in a manner
[1:04:22] you catch it serving the lord Lord is a
[1:04:25] life inside of you where you are giving
[1:04:29] yourself daily to his will not your own
[1:04:36] will the reality of the Gospel is that
[1:04:39] our lives brother Bram says in Statue of
[1:04:41] a perfect man he said God's burden for
[1:04:44] my heart and what's upon with this
[1:04:46] message is to build
[1:04:50] powerhouses of the Living
[1:04:53] God powerhouses isn't always how we
[1:04:56] think about things it's Walking In step
[1:04:59] with God's word it's putting God first
[1:05:02] in
[1:05:09] everything verse five now watch
[1:05:13] this and the meat of his table and the
[1:05:17] sitting of his
[1:05:19] servants so she's seeing all
[1:05:21] this and the attendance of his ministers
[1:05:25] and their
[1:05:26] apparel and his cup bearers and his
[1:05:29] Ascent by which he went up under the
[1:05:32] house of the Lord there was no more
[1:05:35] spirit in her this is what I want you to
[1:05:38] catch she was there and she saw the
[1:05:42] display of the wisdom of Solomon in the
[1:05:46] courts of the
[1:05:47] king but the wisdom of Solomon was not
[1:05:51] confined to just the courts of the king
[1:05:55] it wasn't confined to when service was
[1:05:59] just going on it wasn't confined just to
[1:06:02] Solomon but Solomon by yielding to the
[1:06:05] Lord that wisdom itself it came down and
[1:06:09] it had an effect to wear even the meat
[1:06:12] on his table what they're eating and
[1:06:14] partaking of in their home Hallelujah is
[1:06:16] so Hallelujah yes sir what we eating and
[1:06:20] partaking in the home even the way that
[1:06:23] the position iing of the
[1:06:26] servants God is interested in see
[1:06:29] details speak of God God is in every
[1:06:33] little aspect of it even the attendance
[1:06:36] of the servants even the apparel even
[1:06:38] the clothing what they wor it showed
[1:06:41] whether they had received the wisdom of
[1:06:43] God or not and not just received it you
[1:06:46] see it would be one thing listen what if
[1:06:48] she said what if the Queen of Sheba it
[1:06:51] comes and where she sees somebody going
[1:06:53] along maybe they've got on the right a
[1:06:55] power apparel here they are holding the
[1:06:57] right meat but it's just like there's
[1:06:59] something about it it's just not right
[1:07:01] in their Spirit there's like a complaint
[1:07:03] there's like a a critique there's like a
[1:07:05] man I don't like all this I don't like
[1:07:07] having to wear this I don't like having
[1:07:09] to do this and I don't know why Solomon
[1:07:11] thinks all this is so important and all
[1:07:13] of these things even if they wouldn't
[1:07:15] have said it out here it would have
[1:07:17] picked it up oh yes oh yes because your
[1:07:21] life you know these quotes your life
[1:07:25] your life your testimony speaks
[1:07:28] louder than any
[1:07:32] words is that right look at this did to
[1:07:36] her there's no more spirit in
[1:07:38] her
[1:07:40] my I I think if there's anything in this
[1:07:43] hour that if there ought to be and is
[1:07:46] any lives in any people upon Earth to
[1:07:50] where others can see they don't have to
[1:07:52] go out to Colorado Springs Colorado to
[1:07:54] know what a family is they can look and
[1:07:57] see there are families that are founded
[1:08:01] upon the revelation of Jesus Christ in
[1:08:04] this
[1:08:08] hour I'm asking you to pray for me right
[1:08:11] now because these are things that when
[1:08:14] we as we speak on them and burden
[1:08:15] there's a lot of things i' I could just
[1:08:17] I would love you to stay here for hours
[1:08:19] because there's a lot more of things to
[1:08:21] unpack with us but we can only begin one
[1:08:23] Journey at a
[1:08:25] time and I mean that in a manner that
[1:08:27] we're all here to
[1:08:29] grow you see when we've come to hear the
[1:08:32] word of God this is not about you're
[1:08:34] wrong you're right this is not listen if
[1:08:36] that's how you're hearing the message
[1:08:37] you're hearing it completely wrong we're
[1:08:39] here the prophet said over and over to
[1:08:42] take inventory of our own
[1:08:45] lives hallu yes sir anybody ever heard
[1:08:49] of the story of the emperor new
[1:08:52] clothes
[1:08:55] you know what that was they sold here
[1:08:58] they they came to this individual just
[1:09:01] in case somebody Haden and they they
[1:09:03] wanted to tell them all these wonderful
[1:09:05] clothes the clothes you got on to that
[1:09:06] Emperor and nothing and Men you ought to
[1:09:08] see these clothes and we're going to
[1:09:09] sell these clothes to you and we're
[1:09:11] going to make them and I'm going to make
[1:09:12] this outfit for you and everything well
[1:09:15] there wasn't
[1:09:17] nothing and here you have the emperor
[1:09:20] walking out there
[1:09:22] naked and he's he had clothes
[1:09:26] on I tell you friends let me just let me
[1:09:28] just say the reason that I I mention I
[1:09:31] say that it's easy your life my life
[1:09:36] could look ever so Godly if you compare
[1:09:39] it to Lady
[1:09:40] OA but you're not comparing it to the
[1:09:43] right
[1:09:45] thing we're not to get adjusted in this
[1:09:48] world it's to take that word and say God
[1:09:50] if there's things how God deals with our
[1:09:52] Heart Lord my life I see it's not lining
[1:09:55] up Lord but I want my life to be lined
[1:09:59] up it's an individual Affair
[1:10:03] amen oh my then there was no more spirit
[1:10:06] in her you see that in order that whole
[1:10:09] home was ordered and operated by the
[1:10:11] wisdom of God that's so good oh my now
[1:10:16] as she goes on to say I I just got to
[1:10:17] skip a few of those things she says how
[1:10:21] be it in verse 7 I believe not the words
[1:10:23] until I came and my own eyes had seen it
[1:10:26] and behold the half was not told me thy
[1:10:28] wisdom and prosperity exceeded the fame
[1:10:31] which I heard happy are thy men happy
[1:10:34] are these thy servants you mean the
[1:10:37] wisdom of God could bring happiness in
[1:10:40] the home yes that's good yes if it's
[1:10:45] handled in wisdom that's right the
[1:10:48] wisdom remember the wisdom that Cometh
[1:10:50] From Above I'm quoting James now the
[1:10:53] wisdom that Cometh From Above is
[1:10:57] pure full of Mercy right is that right
[1:11:03] that's why when the prophet when he
[1:11:04] labors in the token message and takes
[1:11:07] that latter part and labors within the
[1:11:10] home he says apply it with
[1:11:14] confidence apply it with an
[1:11:17] understanding apply it he said that
[1:11:19] there would be an
[1:11:21] atmosphere that would be created that
[1:11:24] they would fall
[1:11:29] into happy
[1:11:33] happy oh my you see we're living in an
[1:11:36] hour in a thing where you know I'll just
[1:11:40] say Satan the God of this evil age it's
[1:11:44] everything about and the things that is
[1:11:46] supposedly set forth to be happy it a
[1:11:49] making nobody happy there's more
[1:11:51] Depression more anxiety more suici side
[1:11:53] among young people oh yes that's true
[1:11:57] and you know I'm just what I've looked
[1:11:59] at was the the statistics over it if I
[1:12:01] can get the word out over the past
[1:12:03] couple years over in
[1:12:06] places in what we would call affluent
[1:12:09] communities oh
[1:12:11] yes oh yes Perry Ohio is one of them and
[1:12:15] they can't figure out what's going on
[1:12:17] with the middle
[1:12:19] school that's
[1:12:21] right that's right
[1:12:24] you know I'm thankful to God that God
[1:12:28] has given us Grace in this
[1:12:31] hour but we want to receive that Grace
[1:12:35] amen because let me say this to you as
[1:12:37] parents and every one of us as brothers
[1:12:39] and sisters God has entrusted you and I
[1:12:43] you might be the person that puts the
[1:12:45] meat on the table maybe I'm the person
[1:12:47] who Bears a cup maybe another person is
[1:12:50] a person who serves something else pulls
[1:12:52] out chairs no matter matter what it is
[1:12:54] whatever part whatever purpose you have
[1:12:56] to play Let the wisdom of God flow
[1:12:59] through your life as a father as a
[1:13:02] mother as a husband as a wife say Lord
[1:13:05] don't ever be ashamed Lord we need your
[1:13:07] [Music]
[1:13:12] wisdom they were ring around the gift of
[1:13:15] God how many knows brother Brown will
[1:13:16] say that word over and over
[1:13:20] rallying brother Brown let me just read
[1:13:22] a few of these quotes before I as I move
[1:13:24] on brother Bram talks about how they he
[1:13:27] says you know in the days of Solomon was
[1:13:29] a golden age for Israel because all the
[1:13:30] people with one Accord rallied around
[1:13:32] the great gift that Solomon had from God
[1:13:35] he said I wonder what would take place
[1:13:37] tonight if all the churches in the
[1:13:38] United States would rally around the
[1:13:41] gift that God has give us that is the
[1:13:44] Holy Ghost God's gift what if all the
[1:13:48] churches would break down their barriers
[1:13:51] and would rally around the great gift of
[1:13:54] Godly brotherly love and the baptism of
[1:13:58] the Holy Spirit it would be the greatest
[1:14:00] defense this nation could have it would
[1:14:03] be better than all the scientists and
[1:14:05] atomic bombs and so forth that they
[1:14:07] could invent that's what God wants us to
[1:14:10] do how many want to do what God wants
[1:14:12] you to do amen all of us in our
[1:14:15] different denominations now we're not in
[1:14:17] different different denominations but to
[1:14:20] understand every one of us are diverse
[1:14:22] and
[1:14:24] different your makeups are different
[1:14:28] every gift in the body is different we
[1:14:31] are
[1:14:34] different and I don't mean that in a
[1:14:36] negative way like she's different I
[1:14:39] don't mean it like that but it's to
[1:14:42] recognize one another as brothers and
[1:14:45] sisters rallying around this great gift
[1:14:48] of God which is the holy ghost that
[1:14:51] comes with power and manifestation and
[1:14:55] demonstrations of his presence God's
[1:14:57] wisdom coming down then there would not
[1:15:00] be one cruel word spoken against any
[1:15:03] move of God we'd all be one one great
[1:15:07] big bundle of Godly love that's what
[1:15:10] it's going to take for the church to go
[1:15:12] in the Rapture oh
[1:15:14] yes that's good I want you to think of
[1:15:17] this scripture in in Proverbs 16:7 I'm
[1:15:19] not going to ask you to raise your hand
[1:15:21] but this scripture here and you're
[1:15:22] probably reading it as I'm talking but
[1:15:25] every one of us you've got
[1:15:30] enemies and this just so you understand
[1:15:33] now I'm not trying to bring up bad
[1:15:35] memories but I this is what I want you
[1:15:38] to
[1:15:40] understand you're always going to have
[1:15:43] enemies but it's what are you going to
[1:15:45] do about it cuz the Bible said love your
[1:15:48] enemies pray for them that do
[1:15:51] despitefully use you I mean that part of
[1:15:53] the scripture that wouldn't be hard if
[1:15:55] we don't have no
[1:15:57] enemies it wouldn't be hard to pray for
[1:15:59] somebody who despitefully uses us if
[1:16:01] they didn't despitefully use us we just
[1:16:04] glory to God Amen Lord then it comes
[1:16:08] down on our part we're like o I think I
[1:16:11] need to pray about that before I pray
[1:16:12] about that I need the discernment I
[1:16:14] really need
[1:16:16] discernment remember we want to follow
[1:16:18] the blueprint but watch this watch this
[1:16:20] in Proverbs 16:7 when a man's way
[1:16:24] please the Lord he maketh even his
[1:16:29] enemies to be at peace with him how many
[1:16:32] know that within Israel that when Israel
[1:16:34] came in the land there' be times when
[1:16:37] the enemies would get stirred up what
[1:16:40] what was it called the en what was it
[1:16:42] that caused the enemies to get stirred
[1:16:43] up and come over it's when man's ways
[1:16:49] were no longer pleasing
[1:16:51] God and God would allow the enemies to
[1:16:55] rise up that's right so when a man's
[1:16:58] ways please the Lord it isn't God saying
[1:17:02] now I'm going to go in and I'm going to
[1:17:03] change the heart of that enemy God can
[1:17:05] do that but there is a principle that's
[1:17:07] right here that when things arise like
[1:17:11] this we in our lives just like when you
[1:17:14] go to a doctor you tell the doctor
[1:17:16] symptoms right you tell them symptoms
[1:17:20] and then they hear your symptoms listen
[1:17:22] to your heart do all these other things
[1:17:25] then they make a diagnosis based on
[1:17:27] symptoms so I I know that maybe a lot of
[1:17:30] things right now it deals with uh and I
[1:17:33] hate to say it because I know there's
[1:17:34] real doctors out there but sometimes
[1:17:36] things are just treating symptoms
[1:17:38] instead of really getting down to what's
[1:17:40] the root of the
[1:17:41] problem and see sometimes where God is
[1:17:44] at God is making things known as far as
[1:17:47] symptoms but if all we do is just say
[1:17:51] well this symptom is being made known
[1:17:53] and I need an AED to take care of this
[1:17:55] when a symptom you see a symptom and
[1:17:57] God's making it known say Lord help me
[1:17:59] to look deeper Lord because that symptom
[1:18:02] is only something that's coming out from
[1:18:05] a different
[1:18:08] cause well that's just the wisdom of God
[1:18:11] for us to be able to look so when a
[1:18:13] man's ways please the Lord he maketh
[1:18:15] even his enemies to be at peace with him
[1:18:19] prise the Lord hallelujah that's why
[1:18:22] when things rise on the job consider are
[1:18:25] my ways pleasing the Lord I don't have
[1:18:27] to wonder and say well I wonder I can
[1:18:30] come right I come right back to the
[1:18:31] blueprint and say have I varied off of
[1:18:34] the blueprint and really begin to seek
[1:18:37] God lord where has there been a varying
[1:18:40] because this is your word when a man's
[1:18:42] ways please God he maketh his enemies to
[1:18:45] be at peace with
[1:18:49] him
[1:18:51] or or
[1:18:53] you can become the Donut King and donut
[1:18:56] Queen yeah trying to appease him ask
[1:18:59] Israel how far that's
[1:19:02] gotten you you see these are principles
[1:19:04] within God's word I I I know God can
[1:19:07] change hearts of people's lives but to
[1:19:10] understand this what took place brother
[1:19:12] Bram says in the days of Solomon he said
[1:19:14] he goes on in the next quote all the
[1:19:16] nations feared Israel instead of trying
[1:19:19] to make war with them they brought in
[1:19:21] peace offerings
[1:19:23] they were not afraid so much of their
[1:19:25] man they were afraid of that God that
[1:19:28] they were in unity
[1:19:31] with it's like in the The Six Day War
[1:19:34] how many testimonies when you you read
[1:19:37] of that and hear of mosha Diane and all
[1:19:40] them with Israel listen friends these
[1:19:41] are not just Fly by Night things God
[1:19:43] said he'll stand with
[1:19:46] Israel is that right and to think of how
[1:19:50] that even when Israel did not not I I
[1:19:53] say this respectfully and by numbers did
[1:19:56] not have a chance but you have that to
[1:19:59] where there's Egyptians I believe it was
[1:20:01] or syrians forgive me right now they got
[1:20:03] out of their tanks and ran away because
[1:20:07] they saw the pillar of fire
[1:20:12] Hallelujah I'm telling you you don't
[1:20:14] have to fight your own
[1:20:18] battles if you put God first God will
[1:20:21] fight your battles
[1:20:24] Hallelujah hall hallelujah God will make
[1:20:27] your enemies be at peace and bring peace
[1:20:34] offerings that's not just applied to a
[1:20:37] father to a mother that's of a home
[1:20:40] right that's in school that's among
[1:20:42] young people that's among their all of
[1:20:45] us
[1:20:50] right wow we could preach on that one
[1:20:52] for a little bit but let's let's let's
[1:20:55] go I want to just say the next the other
[1:20:59] the part of what it
[1:21:02] brought this reality there in that home
[1:21:05] it brought a confidence it brought an
[1:21:07] assurance and it brought a stability
[1:21:09] look how brother Brandon words this in
[1:21:11] 1959 Queen of
[1:21:13] Sheba he said every traveler would come
[1:21:15] by that's Pastor Israel would say oh you
[1:21:19] should go up there and see those people
[1:21:21] they're just as bold as they can be they
[1:21:24] know there's not a
[1:21:27] flaw about their
[1:21:29] religion that's the way we want to
[1:21:33] believe it there's nothing wrong with
[1:21:36] the holy spirit it's a perfect gift of
[1:21:39] God to the church amen now think of what
[1:21:43] the early church it was the same thing
[1:21:45] the early church did when the Holy Ghost
[1:21:47] fell the Bible tells us in Acts 2 also
[1:21:50] comes over in Acts 4 that they sold all
[1:21:53] of their possessions and they had things
[1:21:56] in common they had singleness of heart
[1:21:59] now remember brother brandham himself a
[1:22:01] man challenged brother bandham on that
[1:22:04] particular scripture and said that was
[1:22:06] the biggest error and the biggest move
[1:22:09] that the whole that the early church
[1:22:10] made and brother BR said how can the
[1:22:13] Church of the Living God be led by the
[1:22:16] spirit of God and make an error like
[1:22:18] that he said well brother brandom look
[1:22:20] what happened they didn't have no homes
[1:22:22] to go back to when trouble came do you
[1:22:25] see what this was actually speaking of
[1:22:27] is when our lives to be so dedicated and
[1:22:31] devoted to God to where I'm not going to
[1:22:33] be tied down by anything of this life I
[1:22:37] may have to work I have a job but my job
[1:22:40] is not going to be my owner I will not
[1:22:42] be subservient and allow the world the
[1:22:46] riches and anything of this world to
[1:22:48] control my life amen are you hearing me
[1:22:54] I'm not going to allow that to happen oh
[1:22:55] brother Samuel you just don't understand
[1:22:57] remember what I said before I cannot
[1:22:59] labor and preach on this this morning
[1:23:01] but many times the way that we try to
[1:23:03] solve problems is we go about the arm of
[1:23:07] Flesh well I'm just going to get myself
[1:23:09] out of debt so I'm going to work work
[1:23:11] work work or work wait a
[1:23:13] minute you didn't get yourself out of
[1:23:15] debt by obeying the Lord or get yourself
[1:23:16] in debt by B obeying God too many
[1:23:19] scriptures that's so good that didn't
[1:23:21] happen just by doing so you're not going
[1:23:23] to get out of debt by doing it on your
[1:23:27] own you've got to come back to the
[1:23:29] scripture seek ye first the kingdom of
[1:23:31] God now I realize when I say things like
[1:23:34] this that's where it gets down to
[1:23:36] whether or not you actually trust God
[1:23:37] and believe it or not that's good yes
[1:23:41] sir but it you know it's a choice
[1:23:43] friends look look the only thing I can
[1:23:45] do I I preach the word there's going to
[1:23:47] be an elect there's going to be a bride
[1:23:49] I believe listen I preach as everybody
[1:23:51] is going I stand I pray pray I labor
[1:23:53] within that manner I refuse to leave
[1:23:56] hoof behind you might say brother Samuel
[1:23:58] why are you ministering like that why
[1:24:00] don't you just let me alone listen if
[1:24:02] you're here you're a part of this
[1:24:03] assembly and God lays the burden to
[1:24:06] bring this word you are part of this and
[1:24:08] the burden lays on my heart I long to
[1:24:11] see lives and hearts that'll stand there
[1:24:14] on that day I trust that I'm there when
[1:24:17] every one of you and I get to hear you
[1:24:19] walk before the
[1:24:21] throne
[1:24:24] glory be to God hallelujah
[1:24:29] hallelujah Glory
[1:24:31] Hallelujah I get excited
[1:24:35] now watch this first Corinthians 11:1
[1:24:40] notice what Paul said now remember they
[1:24:41] were bold this was something that was
[1:24:43] exemplified they were bold there was no
[1:24:45] flaw in their religion you know there's
[1:24:47] something about it a confidence an
[1:24:49] assurance a stability that even as a
[1:24:52] young person that brother B said you're
[1:24:54] getting ready to take a chemistry test
[1:24:55] he said slip in there of a morning and
[1:24:57] say dad while we're over the breakfast
[1:24:59] would you pray for me this morning he
[1:25:01] said you watch if it don't turn out
[1:25:03] better God will take things like that
[1:25:06] cuz let me just tell you something I
[1:25:07] hated chemistry now I don't mean to
[1:25:09] offend nobody else and you know my other
[1:25:10] son over here this guy can pick this
[1:25:12] stuff apart left and right and
[1:25:13] everything that was not my forte my
[1:25:16] forte was geology I loved rocks if it
[1:25:18] was science and all that right there but
[1:25:20] this is what I'm trying to tell you is
[1:25:22] that there's things that you will face
[1:25:23] in life that chemistry itself will seem
[1:25:26] like a peanut but it will be the
[1:25:29] experience of what God did for you on a
[1:25:31] chemistry test that'll help you when you
[1:25:34] have another test in your life when you
[1:25:36] have another situation it is training
[1:25:39] and teaching them and putting the order
[1:25:42] that if we we look to the Lord Jehovah
[1:25:46] is our strength he is our Heth he is our
[1:25:51] stabilizer
[1:25:56] 1 Corinthians 11:1 Paul said be you
[1:25:58] followers of me that means
[1:26:01] imitators even as I also am of Christ
[1:26:06] now I Praise You Brethren that you
[1:26:08] remember me in all things and keep the
[1:26:11] ordinances as I delivered them to you so
[1:26:15] not just of the word but even the
[1:26:17] ordinances even my ways even all of
[1:26:20] those things so not just keeping word
[1:26:22] but you saw the word exemplified before
[1:26:26] you but I would have you to know that
[1:26:28] the head of every man is Christ and the
[1:26:32] head of the woman is the man and the
[1:26:34] head of Christ is God see how that
[1:26:38] wisdom is supposed how God has ordained
[1:26:41] for it to travel down God has ordained
[1:26:44] for it in that way now I want you to
[1:26:46] watch this there's a message if you
[1:26:48] haven't listened to it in a while
[1:26:50] there's actually a couple I'd like you
[1:26:51] to listen to but one I'd like you to
[1:26:53] listen to it's only about 27 minutes
[1:26:54] long but what house will you build me
[1:26:57] I'd like you to listen to that that I've
[1:26:58] been I've been I've went over that and
[1:27:00] over that and over that but not just
[1:27:02] recently but but before but I want you
[1:27:04] just to to listen to that just take it
[1:27:05] in be good to something you listen to
[1:27:07] and talk about husband and wife reflect
[1:27:10] on with family but I want you to watch
[1:27:11] how brother brandom here is speaking
[1:27:14] regarding brother Green's appointment in
[1:27:16] coming there to Arizona cuz remember
[1:27:18] brother Perry green moved from Texas to
[1:27:20] Arizona now watch he said is I I want I
[1:27:23] don't want to take brother Green's time
[1:27:24] here because I heard brother green
[1:27:25] several times speak and I certainly was
[1:27:28] influenced as he brought the word of the
[1:27:31] Lord to us and so humble about it what
[1:27:34] an example that was set for all of
[1:27:37] us I know sometimes we have our
[1:27:40] favorites and I know sometimes our
[1:27:41] favorites we want to spiritualize it but
[1:27:43] really God has a
[1:27:46] diversity God has a diversity and just
[1:27:48] so you understand deciel level has
[1:27:51] nothing to do with the an
[1:27:53] anointing I mean I I am who I am you
[1:27:55] know brother Trevor is who he is and
[1:27:57] brother Nathan brother Brian every one
[1:27:59] of we're all different I I you know the
[1:28:01] way that I study I go about things it's
[1:28:03] different from somebody else I I just
[1:28:05] can only be who God has made me to
[1:28:09] be right same thing for you if you're
[1:28:11] not then you're you're you're an
[1:28:14] impersonator man but you know when you
[1:28:17] think about it it ought to be something
[1:28:19] to where we ought to be able just to be
[1:28:21] a able to receive from the Lord remember
[1:28:24] brother bam text us there and why and
[1:28:26] why people are so tossed about he comes
[1:28:28] to the end of that message and he's
[1:28:29] talking about the anointing of the
[1:28:31] spirit of God he said that the anointing
[1:28:33] itself is supreme power and control and
[1:28:36] he spoke of how that when the Lord Jesus
[1:28:38] read it and set down precious words
[1:28:41] proceeded from his life if you really
[1:28:43] consider it most of the preaching of the
[1:28:45] Lord Jesus it certainly was not like
[1:28:47] me he was sitting
[1:28:50] down and he wasn't sweating right that's
[1:28:53] right that's scripture is it not but
[1:28:55] sometimes our minds our ideas of it's
[1:28:57] got to be now listen well once again we
[1:28:59] might have our certain preferences but
[1:29:01] we need to make sure we're not just
[1:29:04] looking at the vesture on the outside
[1:29:07] because let me just tell you something
[1:29:09] your your life your soul cannot feed on
[1:29:13] emotion that's a direct quote your soul
[1:29:16] feeds on the word of
[1:29:19] God 100% is that right I mean I I you
[1:29:22] know I can say it I I'm emotional but it
[1:29:24] don't feed on emotion it feeds on the
[1:29:27] word of God how did we get here I
[1:29:30] certainly was
[1:29:31] influenced as he brought the word of the
[1:29:33] Lord to us and so humble about it now
[1:29:36] watch he says I don't get the word from
[1:29:38] the Lord is maybe it would come in
[1:29:39] Revelation as it's been sent now this is
[1:29:41] what brother green said I don't get it
[1:29:42] as it's been sent but I like to
[1:29:46] stress upon what has been said like when
[1:29:50] Paul wrote something in the Bible I come
[1:29:53] here to stress upon what he said I have
[1:29:56] no message only just to stress on what's
[1:30:01] already been said from the
[1:30:04] Lord said that's remarkable for a young
[1:30:06] fell to say that I'd say Amen there many
[1:30:09] many more young fellas could take advice
[1:30:11] from this and stop trying to correct the
[1:30:14] Prophet come on now stop trying to say
[1:30:18] that you know this is his opinion and
[1:30:19] this is this round I'm not going back to
[1:30:21] denomination
[1:30:23] Sorry God has given a message where his
[1:30:26] thoughts have come down to you and
[1:30:30] I so notice what brother green said my
[1:30:34] position is to
[1:30:36] stress what's already come says it twice
[1:30:40] now if that's the position there at
[1:30:43] brother Perry as the pastor CU really
[1:30:46] any other Ministry we don't have any
[1:30:48] other message to preach than the message
[1:30:50] that God has given us us that's not been
[1:30:53] manhandled and to stress means to give a
[1:30:56] particular emphasis or an importance to
[1:31:00] a point statement idea that's been made
[1:31:03] in speech or writing now I'm asking you
[1:31:06] as parents what do you stress
[1:31:10] on oh brother Samuel my job no no you
[1:31:12] misunderstood what are you stressing to
[1:31:16] be
[1:31:19] important oh brother Samuel
[1:31:22] my child's education I can preach on
[1:31:24] this CU I got three
[1:31:25] boys my child's
[1:31:28] education but what about their
[1:31:31] soul what about their soul they might be
[1:31:34] the smartest CEO might end up being this
[1:31:37] and being that but whatever you stress
[1:31:40] as important listen friends we can't say
[1:31:42] one thing and do another that's right
[1:31:44] that's called
[1:31:48] confusion it's what we stress that
[1:31:51] that's important now I believe I believe
[1:31:54] in our children I believe they ought to
[1:31:56] I believe in you know our kids getting
[1:31:57] good grades as far as when I say good
[1:31:59] grades I believe they ought to try I
[1:32:01] believe there's everything they ought to
[1:32:02] put forth within their school but I am
[1:32:05] not living just for them to get through
[1:32:08] college right we got quiet we I'll come
[1:32:12] out here and preach then I'll come down
[1:32:13] there if I need to that's not what we
[1:32:16] I'm living about God is a
[1:32:19] provider you realize when God called me
[1:32:22] away from my job to stand here and take
[1:32:24] this post you realize even of everything
[1:32:27] that there and I'm not saying this to
[1:32:29] look at me but everything that had to be
[1:32:32] forsaken oh yeah an insurance plan right
[1:32:36] come on now things that if you ask me
[1:32:38] how my boys going to get to school and
[1:32:40] how's this going to be and how's that
[1:32:42] going to be I could tell you I don't
[1:32:44] know how but I know what he told me he
[1:32:48] said if you keep your heart and your
[1:32:50] mind centered on me
[1:32:52] I'll take care of everything you have
[1:32:53] need of hallah not everything I want
[1:32:57] just what I need and I want to go on
[1:32:59] record He's been
[1:33:01] Faithful he has been faithful but once
[1:33:05] again sometimes it's the way we think
[1:33:07] about things and we stress about
[1:33:12] it man I wish I could spend more time on
[1:33:15] this some you're like come on keep going
[1:33:17] keep going move
[1:33:20] on
[1:33:23] you see your kids my kids my boys too I
[1:33:27] can preach on these things not only
[1:33:28] because of my boys but I've been here
[1:33:31] I've went through I've went through this
[1:33:33] is school I knew what it was like to
[1:33:36] come to midweek service have to go home
[1:33:38] and then I got to take a test the next
[1:33:40] morning I know what that's like your
[1:33:43] friends I'm not trying to put rules and
[1:33:44] governance I'm saying what are we
[1:33:47] stressing what are we stressing you say
[1:33:50] well that don't mean very much
[1:33:52] watch oh yes it'll start with just a
[1:33:54] test oh yes and then over and over it'll
[1:33:58] eventually carry on in the adult life
[1:34:00] I'm too tired I'm too weary I can't do
[1:34:02] this I can't do that why it's because of
[1:34:05] what was taught back
[1:34:07] there that's right wo we got a little
[1:34:10] quiet there but that's all right it's
[1:34:12] all
[1:34:13] right I know where I'm
[1:34:16] standing stress and it's what we stress
[1:34:19] on I wonder if Solomon did Solomon just
[1:34:21] stress on certain parts in the word was
[1:34:25] it certain things that he just stressed
[1:34:26] on or was it all of it let me tell you
[1:34:28] what kind of material Solomon went with
[1:34:30] Solomon himself did not just pick any
[1:34:33] material to put into the building but
[1:34:35] Solomon himself even chose things of
[1:34:38] that of the Cedars of Lebanon he chose
[1:34:41] that of gold you know these are things
[1:34:43] that had to be brought in to the land of
[1:34:46] Israel he chose things of materials that
[1:34:51] really
[1:34:52] displayed what he thought of God Amen
[1:34:55] brother that's so good watch what
[1:34:58] brother Bram says in the message one
[1:34:59] this is all the way through the message
[1:35:01] brother BR said I don't believe there's
[1:35:02] any marriage can be what it ought to be
[1:35:04] without a union between husband and wife
[1:35:07] and God they'll bring up children in the
[1:35:09] world make them illegitimates give them
[1:35:11] cigarettes whiskey play cards in their
[1:35:13] side drink liquor before them you know
[1:35:15] what I never understood I never
[1:35:16] understood why parents that could stand
[1:35:18] there and swear in front of their kids
[1:35:20] and would get on their kids for swearing
[1:35:22] I thought this is the it's a this
[1:35:25] nonsense they would get on their kids
[1:35:27] for smoking cigarettes and they smoked
[1:35:30] them they would get on their kids and
[1:35:32] for drinking and they
[1:35:34] drink I don't know about to you but that
[1:35:37] seems like confusion to
[1:35:42] me no matter how loyal they are to their
[1:35:45] marriage vows that's sexually that's
[1:35:46] flesh but there's a spirit in there that
[1:35:49] Spirit of a sinner Papa and Mama no
[1:35:52] matter how loyal to their children will
[1:35:54] come well you say I know men and women
[1:35:57] that don't teach their children that and
[1:35:59] wasn't
[1:36:00] Christians the very thing of not leading
[1:36:05] them to Christ was the wrongest thing
[1:36:09] they could ever do besides the other not
[1:36:12] to lead them to
[1:36:15] Christ now he didn't say lead him to
[1:36:17] Sunday school I believe Sunday school is
[1:36:19] good he didn't say lead him to youth
[1:36:21] meeting I believe youth meeting is good
[1:36:24] he didn't say just lead him to church
[1:36:26] that's good but lead
[1:36:28] them no don't just drop them off lead
[1:36:31] them it's leading in every facet of Life
[1:36:36] leading through every stage leading
[1:36:38] through every season everybody with me
[1:36:42] amen watch this in Psalms 128 verse one
[1:36:46] I just want to make sure my mic didn't
[1:36:48] go out Psalms 128 verse1
[1:36:52] how many want to be
[1:36:53] blessed amen blessed is everyone that
[1:36:57] fearth the Lord that's reverence him
[1:37:00] that walketh so walketh in his ways not
[1:37:03] not just see the reverence will
[1:37:06] translate into
[1:37:08] action watch this verse two for Thou
[1:37:11] shalt eat the labor of thine hands happy
[1:37:14] shalt thou be and it shall be well with
[1:37:18] thee that is so good how many remember
[1:37:20] when Israel God rebuked him for
[1:37:22] worshiping ba remember that you remember
[1:37:25] what ba what they started doing they
[1:37:27] started worshiping ba and calling out
[1:37:29] that our crops are failing we can't
[1:37:31] figure out what's going on so we got to
[1:37:33] find a god we've got to find a book
[1:37:35] something on fertility we've got to find
[1:37:37] a God
[1:37:40] why you know why they needed to do that
[1:37:43] they had
[1:37:44] forsaken the ways of the
[1:37:46] Lord and they started to have to
[1:37:49] scramble to try to compensate in other
[1:37:51] areas but let me tell you something
[1:37:52] there's nothing that beats the plan of
[1:37:56] putting God first nothing nothing even
[1:37:59] compares to it there ain't nothing you
[1:38:01] can put on the table nothing compares to
[1:38:03] fearing the Lord and walking in his ways
[1:38:07] is that how you feel amen notice verse
[1:38:10] three thy wife shall be as a fruitful
[1:38:12] Vine by the sides of thine house thy
[1:38:16] children like Olive plants round about
[1:38:19] thy table this speaking of Life behold
[1:38:23] that thus shall the man be blessed that
[1:38:27] fearth the Lord that is so
[1:38:30] good I'm not going to read Psalms 1 we
[1:38:33] could read that but I you understand
[1:38:35] where it says that regarding that man
[1:38:36] his Delight is in the law of the Lord
[1:38:38] and in his law he doth meditate day and
[1:38:39] night but I just say it in this way
[1:38:42] everything that we do it's a
[1:38:44] choice even when the word comes forth
[1:38:48] even from times of counsel back there
[1:38:50] whether it's back there on the phone it
[1:38:52] always comes down to it I don't make
[1:38:53] decisions for
[1:38:55] nobody these are choices that we make
[1:38:58] you don't make choices for me we all
[1:39:00] have choices to make and that's is why
[1:39:03] that within the choice every one of us
[1:39:05] have the choice as to what you want to
[1:39:08] see in the church you have a choice as
[1:39:12] to what you want to see in your home and
[1:39:16] in your life you have a choice of that
[1:39:19] that's what you choose well Brother Sam
[1:39:21] I want to see remember brother B says we
[1:39:23] can only not by a pretty building but by
[1:39:25] a consecrated
[1:39:29] life Lord I want to see more of you in
[1:39:31] the church then ask God to say Lord I
[1:39:34] want to see more of you here first amen
[1:39:38] am this is where it
[1:39:40] begins this is where it begins Revival
[1:39:42] begins in a personal way amen God moves
[1:39:46] in a personal way Lord I want more of
[1:39:50] you is that right right can I have just
[1:39:52] a little bit more
[1:39:54] time notice this in Ephesians
[1:39:57] 6:4 the Bible said fathers provoke not
[1:40:00] your children to
[1:40:04] [Music]
[1:40:07] wrath Lord have
[1:40:15] mercy I got to go on I'm not going to
[1:40:17] preach that
[1:40:19] part but bring them up in the nurture
[1:40:24] and
[1:40:25] admonition of the
[1:40:28] Lord that right there the first part of
[1:40:30] that verse it kind of sometimes can
[1:40:32] depend on what season of Life your
[1:40:34] children are in yep not saying that
[1:40:37] there's always an exception for it but
[1:40:40] sometimes as they get older and you know
[1:40:42] when they get to certain ages I
[1:40:44] mean I mean they've told the world how
[1:40:47] to
[1:40:48] spin and and this is how things just you
[1:40:51] know they they my you know and and of
[1:40:54] course if we're not careful as
[1:40:56] parents we end up like Jacob putting on
[1:40:58] a coat of many colors and get in trouble
[1:41:00] for
[1:41:02] that I can't preach on that
[1:41:06] today it's true Jacob's Brothers you
[1:41:09] know they had issues with Jacob but Jake
[1:41:12] I mean with Joseph but Jacob didn't help
[1:41:13] that
[1:41:14] either I said Jacob didn't help that
[1:41:17] either that's true are you with me he
[1:41:19] didn't help it that's he didn't help
[1:41:22] him why you say that because even
[1:41:24] Prophet told us down there when when
[1:41:26] when Joseph was in that prison house he
[1:41:28] said he felt like he was a great
[1:41:33] guy so these are these are things that
[1:41:35] we we stay on a tight when it's on it
[1:41:37] and we jump off here and apply it over
[1:41:38] here but to understand that there's
[1:41:40] things that even in that oh how we need
[1:41:42] God's grace I I don't want to lay on
[1:41:44] that the to this morning but bring them
[1:41:47] up in the nurture and admonition of the
[1:41:49] Lord right I want to ask you to raise
[1:41:52] your hand but how many of you and I I
[1:41:54] want to just give an example I thought
[1:41:55] this is a good example of how that when
[1:41:57] you're taking and we're talking on the
[1:41:59] things of the Lord you know when you
[1:42:01] have a Bible study and you talk on the
[1:42:03] things of the Lord I believe if there's
[1:42:04] anything we should be talking about with
[1:42:06] our families it should be on the things
[1:42:08] of the Lord now once again I'm going to
[1:42:11] go ahead and say it because I think I
[1:42:12] have to qualify it is that it doesn't
[1:42:14] mean that your house is a
[1:42:17] monastery that you know you don't have
[1:42:19] to say that
[1:42:21] canest thou pass the salt shaker to me
[1:42:24] and where every single conversation is
[1:42:27] I've got to have a scripture got to have
[1:42:29] a quote that's not we're talking about
[1:42:30] that's not that's not even life that's
[1:42:33] not even life and you there's no there's
[1:42:35] no substance to it that's not wisdom
[1:42:37] flowing but notice when is a time to
[1:42:41] talk about things like brother Ram's
[1:42:42] talking about with his little little
[1:42:44] kids right here now I want you to let me
[1:42:46] read this to you so you see where
[1:42:47] brother Ram's talking about doing Bible
[1:42:49] study my he's not even talking about
[1:42:52] doing it around the table what what's
[1:42:53] what he does he said every evening when
[1:42:55] I'm home in the message Elisha the
[1:42:57] prophet after everything's cleaned out I
[1:42:59] take my girls and give them a Bible
[1:43:01] study I put them in the car wow Bible
[1:43:05] study in the
[1:43:08] car I love this it breaks down all
[1:43:12] formalities you see it puts things
[1:43:14] friends so that we realize it's part of
[1:43:16] our life that's what God that's what it
[1:43:17] is to serve the Lord he is our life and
[1:43:21] right around wife and baby and I give
[1:43:23] them questions like who was Elijah what
[1:43:25] was he right quick them little
[1:43:27] six-year-old 8-year-old girls say
[1:43:28] tishbite yep I'd say how do you know
[1:43:31] that how could you tell if you'd meet
[1:43:32] him today what kind of man was he oh he
[1:43:34] was a hairy man had leather around his
[1:43:36] loins little Rebecca and Sarah would
[1:43:38] holler out just keep drilling that into
[1:43:42] their
[1:43:43] minds well brother Samuel I don't want
[1:43:45] to force nothing down him you think the
[1:43:48] world is doing
[1:43:49] that yes sir that's right do you think
[1:43:54] the world and school is all of a sudden
[1:43:56] pulling back no I don't want to put my
[1:43:57] agenda I don't want to are you kidding
[1:43:59] me right the world through every Avenue
[1:44:02] our kids have certain things even as I
[1:44:04] told some of the young ones with with
[1:44:06] the children and things right now I said
[1:44:07] look you're already there's things that
[1:44:09] you will have to approach at a much
[1:44:11] younger age than what I
[1:44:12] did from the time that I were married I
[1:44:15] went from the big old bulky you know
[1:44:17] cell phone you had to have a red wagon
[1:44:19] behind you to pull it behind you then
[1:44:20] you go to these little smartphones we
[1:44:22] have
[1:44:24] now sometimes I think they're smarter
[1:44:26] than us but notice just keep drilling
[1:44:29] that into their minds drilling it
[1:44:32] constantly that's what you do to your
[1:44:34] children mother brother BR says quit
[1:44:37] running around all over the city and
[1:44:38] gatting about now that that part right
[1:44:40] there can be interpreted let let let
[1:44:42] this part be what's what's the most
[1:44:44] important give your children Bible
[1:44:46] lectures and things that's the thing to
[1:44:50] do
[1:44:51] he goes on he says all these societies
[1:44:53] and post and all these other things you
[1:44:55] see sometimes the busyness within our
[1:44:58] life if we would sit down and say how
[1:45:00] much of this is really
[1:45:04] edifying Christ in the life of our child
[1:45:07] in the life of our home even in your
[1:45:10] life if we just would evaluate
[1:45:14] that he said I believe I've heard my
[1:45:16] expression of you heard my expression of
[1:45:18] women preachers he said I might have to
[1:45:20] crawl back on it but every mother is a
[1:45:22] preacher God gives her a little
[1:45:24] congregation at home to preach to just
[1:45:26] keep going you get it first and go right
[1:45:29] with your children notice you get it
[1:45:30] first and then go right with your
[1:45:32] children Brother Sam me what are you
[1:45:34] saying listen I'm saying that the things
[1:45:36] that God even has spoke to you today in
[1:45:39] church talk about them right right those
[1:45:42] are things that'll start even a a Bible
[1:45:44] study those are things you don't have to
[1:45:47] go and say well I got to study this out
[1:45:49] no just talk about what God is doing
[1:45:51] right now in your heart what God's doing
[1:45:53] in your life because listen it's between
[1:45:57] you and the Lord that's your experience
[1:45:58] between you and God nobody can talk
[1:46:00] about that like you can and just
[1:46:03] fellowshipping on those things right
[1:46:04] there and watch God's presence watch the
[1:46:07] enrichment in your home watch how his
[1:46:09] life just flows through it don't have to
[1:46:11] be something way extravagant out here
[1:46:14] it's just make him
[1:46:16] aart and if there's things that God's
[1:46:19] dealt with your life
[1:46:21] let me tell you there's times I've
[1:46:22] gathered we our family's been gathered
[1:46:24] right around there in the living room
[1:46:25] and so our time then for devotional I
[1:46:28] just have to tell them hey look there's
[1:46:29] some things right here what was what was
[1:46:31] what we heard ministered here or this
[1:46:33] was said there or did you hear this
[1:46:35] right here and I heard brother BR say
[1:46:36] this or something but I'm calling their
[1:46:38] their attention to it in a manner to say
[1:46:40] this is where we need to pick it up this
[1:46:43] is how I feel God dealing with my heart
[1:46:45] this how God dealing with my life amen
[1:46:49] you see what it is it's all Al as I've
[1:46:51] told them as young men I said you're
[1:46:53] going to be leading homes one day right
[1:46:55] oh
[1:46:57] yes you're going to be leading homes
[1:47:00] you'll be husbands you'll be fathers and
[1:47:02] you got to lead that home and everything
[1:47:04] has to come back to it's coming back to
[1:47:07] the word of God it's not what we're
[1:47:08] trying to search brother Samuel I'm not
[1:47:10] a preacher you don't have to be a
[1:47:11] preacher you don't have to be a preacher
[1:47:13] just just just be a believer who loves
[1:47:16] God more than anything else and God will
[1:47:18] give you the wisdom that you have need
[1:47:20] of when you need
[1:47:23] it yes sir you'll do
[1:47:26] it man on man oh man where does time
[1:47:34] go see some of you didn't know what time
[1:47:36] was you having such a good
[1:47:41] time now that's psychology right
[1:47:46] there notice let me read let me let me
[1:47:48] try to close this out here
[1:47:51] and here some time ago brother Bram said
[1:47:54] I was reading an article where there was
[1:47:55] a
[1:47:56] home and five boys was born in this
[1:47:59] home just really hone in on this their
[1:48:02] oldest one got old enough to go to the
[1:48:05] Navy and off to the Navy he went the
[1:48:07] second one followed the next one until
[1:48:10] all the whole five went away to the Navy
[1:48:13] So a family with five boys one oldest
[1:48:16] went to the Navy second end up all of
[1:48:19] them went to the Navy there was no
[1:48:20] Marines sorry brother Carlos or navy men
[1:48:23] in their family the mother and father
[1:48:26] couldn't understand just why these
[1:48:29] people these boys everyone wanted to go
[1:48:32] to the Navy there was a combing
[1:48:35] investigation hope it wasn't a senate
[1:48:37] committee made of this and come to find
[1:48:40] out in the
[1:48:42] bedroom wow bedrooms are important
[1:48:44] aren't they wow yeah yes
[1:48:48] sir bedrooms are they not the off limits
[1:48:52] of token application they're under this
[1:48:56] roof are you hearing me this is not your
[1:48:59] little domain you put whatever color
[1:49:02] siding you want on outside of your
[1:49:06] room oh brother
[1:49:09] Samuel and come to find out you see
[1:49:11] friends lot brother Trevor was preaching
[1:49:13] on these things the Lord was taking him
[1:49:14] on that of alone that part of being
[1:49:17] alone is not
[1:49:19] Godlike when Jesus went to get alone he
[1:49:22] didn't mean alone to himself he went to
[1:49:26] get alone apart from all the cares of
[1:49:30] life and get into the presence of his
[1:49:36] father
[1:49:38] is yes sir all right
[1:49:42] now in this bedroom there was a
[1:49:45] beautiful big picture hanging up there
[1:49:47] of a big ship sailing on a quiet calm
[1:49:50] sea and it so impressed the boys as they
[1:49:54] went to bed at night looking at this
[1:49:57] picture it was on their mind to sail
[1:50:00] that quiet soothing sea and along the
[1:50:04] morning when they Rose the first thing
[1:50:06] they could look at was the ship making
[1:50:09] her way through the quiet calm sea and
[1:50:11] it impressed the boys so that each one
[1:50:13] become a sail so they went to bed
[1:50:16] looking at it they got up looking at it
[1:50:19] you know what that reminds me of in the
[1:50:21] Tabernacle they had the light the lamps
[1:50:25] and trimmed them in the
[1:50:27] morning they checked on them in the
[1:50:30] evening they offered the lamb in the
[1:50:32] morning they offered the lamb in the
[1:50:36] evening I'm going to open my day with
[1:50:39] Jesus I'm going to close my day with
[1:50:42] Jesus because he is Alpha and Omega
[1:50:46] there may been some things in between
[1:50:48] but he is Alpha and Omega
[1:50:53] amen now watch what brother Brown says
[1:50:56] if a picture of a ship will impress boys
[1:50:59] to become Navy men Sailors of the sea
[1:51:03] what art the picture of the Lord Jesus
[1:51:05] Christ
[1:51:06] do always have the right thing before
[1:51:10] your children bring up a child in the
[1:51:14] way that it should go bring it up teach
[1:51:17] it
[1:51:18] right it'll certainly won't depart from
[1:51:24] them I think there's no greater picture
[1:51:27] I love the Hoffman's head of
[1:51:29] Christ i i i there's something
[1:51:34] about having that picture in your home
[1:51:37] oh is something about having the
[1:51:41] picture of the pillar of
[1:51:44] fire God had his picture taken with
[1:51:48] us something very important about
[1:51:51] that brother brandham mentioned those
[1:51:54] things brother Bram speaks of you know
[1:51:57] even our Bible having our Bible
[1:52:03] open it's
[1:52:05] important that it's more than just a
[1:52:08] picture on a
[1:52:09] wall but our
[1:52:12] lives every each one of us are to be an
[1:52:15] example this goes beyond just father and
[1:52:18] mother and all of us today when we talk
[1:52:19] about about a home we're talking about a
[1:52:20] church we're talking about a family
[1:52:22] we're talking about every one of us that
[1:52:23] every one of us listen every one of us
[1:52:25] our lives are
[1:52:27] influencing someone
[1:52:29] else and if there's anything at all if
[1:52:32] there's anything that would be out of
[1:52:34] order if there's anything from our lives
[1:52:39] I am so thankful that God is mindful
[1:52:43] enough to say hey let's get this back in
[1:52:46] line so the wisdom of God can and flow
[1:52:50] through your life as I intend for to
[1:52:54] do I'm grateful that's what this that's
[1:52:57] what the ministry and the word when
[1:52:59] preaching here and dealing with this
[1:53:00] with on families and things like this
[1:53:02] and by God's grace I plan to do this
[1:53:04] every
[1:53:06] month these are things that are very
[1:53:12] important everything's important there's
[1:53:14] not but you understand we can fly so
[1:53:17] high up here in Revelation but if they
[1:53:20] don't come down here and shoe
[1:53:22] leather we're missing
[1:53:24] it we're missing it we it this this
[1:53:28] gospel God came these things that God
[1:53:30] shows us that's God letting us know his
[1:53:32] love his care concerning our lives let
[1:53:36] me just say this if there's been
[1:53:38] anything that has been a hasb been I can
[1:53:41] give you quote after quote where the
[1:53:43] Prophet said Let It Be A has been and
[1:53:46] start fresh right here amen that's one
[1:53:49] thing you you find from the presence of
[1:53:52] the Lord is as we come to him there's
[1:53:54] things that God deals with our life and
[1:53:57] there's Corrections that can be made I
[1:53:59] want to receive this Grace amen I want
[1:54:02] to walk in this Grace amen these are
[1:54:05] things right now to order our lives and
[1:54:07] let me just say this maybe you look and
[1:54:09] and this word these are things I'm just
[1:54:11] speaking to you from my heart sometimes
[1:54:13] there's things I've realized over the
[1:54:14] years from when I first started to
[1:54:15] Pastor sometimes the enemy can come and
[1:54:17] just haunt people when I go to start
[1:54:19] preaching on families let me just tell
[1:54:21] you something you're not getting Stones
[1:54:23] thrown from Brother
[1:54:25] Samuel if there's anything that's
[1:54:27] condemning you that ain't the spirit of
[1:54:28] God he don't
[1:54:30] condemn come on now he convicts that's
[1:54:33] good yes sir the Bible when the Bible
[1:54:36] says all scripture is given by
[1:54:37] inspiration for reprove correction
[1:54:40] reprove and rebuke I love the word
[1:54:41] correction the word correction there
[1:54:43] means healing
[1:54:45] restoration wow that's what correction
[1:54:48] is That's So Good so correction is not
[1:54:50] you're just we're wrong but correction
[1:54:52] says look this is where we're not
[1:54:54] hitting the Mark here's the Mark we're
[1:54:55] supposed to hit let's get there so we
[1:54:57] fix our eyes on the Mark we need to be
[1:54:59] aiming
[1:55:00] towards I say God I want my eyes because
[1:55:03] what means more to me than anything is
[1:55:05] this Rapture amen that means more to me
[1:55:08] than anything what means that that life
[1:55:10] I want to see that life I want to see it
[1:55:12] in every life and every heart just where
[1:55:14] there's just such a as I said that word
[1:55:16] today such a passion between you and God
[1:55:18] it's something that that it's just a
[1:55:20] it's just boiling up in your life to
[1:55:22] where when you're outside of these walls
[1:55:24] it don't end when Music Stops it don't
[1:55:27] end when Church stops you you take the
[1:55:29] things and Lord you spoke to me Lord you
[1:55:32] ministered to my heart and to know he's
[1:55:35] right there to walk with you he doesn't
[1:55:37] stop back there at that door he doesn't
[1:55:40] stop at that door he don't just stop out
[1:55:42] here at the end of the parking lot he
[1:55:44] goes with you amen that's right amen and
[1:55:48] you can take that word in your life
[1:55:50] thank you Lord and for every every home
[1:55:53] to be built oh it first starts here with
[1:55:56] him building your life right let him
[1:55:58] build let him build let him make his
[1:56:00] home in your life how do I do that just
[1:56:02] surrender surrender it to him surrender
[1:56:04] it all to him give it all to him let him
[1:56:06] build himself in you and like Solomon he
[1:56:09] built the house of the Lord in seven
[1:56:11] years then he started on his own
[1:56:14] house this is what's important because
[1:56:17] if I can get this right here if this is
[1:56:20] under his influence then he'll help me
[1:56:22] know what I need in my house if I this
[1:56:25] house is under his influence then the
[1:56:27] other things in my house will be just
[1:56:29] where they need to
[1:56:31] be you love him yes sir amen God bless
[1:56:35] you amen could we just have a word of
[1:56:38] prayer together and I know we're not
[1:56:41] shaking hands one another but maybe as
[1:56:42] families are sitting next to one another
[1:56:45] brothers or sisters if you uh I mean
[1:56:47] brother to brother obviously everything
[1:56:49] respect respectful but could we just lay
[1:56:51] hands on one another would that be all
[1:56:52] right and let's just offer a word of
[1:56:55] prayer because we are we we're a family
[1:56:58] we are a family as a church we are
[1:57:02] family we are family we are a body of
