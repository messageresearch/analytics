[29:40] in Exodus chapter 15
[29:54] exodus chapter 15
[29:57] verse 22
[30:02] I want to just
[30:04] read here beginning in verse 22
[30:11] and so Moses brought Israel from the Red
[30:15] Sea and they went out into the
[30:17] wilderness of Shur and they went three
[30:21] days in the wilderness and found no
[30:23] water and when they had come tomorrow
[30:26] they could not drink of the waters of
[30:28] Marah for they were bitter therefore the
[30:32] name of it was called marna and the
[30:35] people murmured against Moses saying
[30:39] what shall we drink and he cried unto
[30:43] the Lord and the Lord showed him a tree
[30:47] which when he had cast it into the
[30:50] waters the waters were made sweet and
[30:54] there he made for them a statue and an
[30:57] ordinance and there he proved them and
[31:00] said if thou wilt diligently hearken to
[31:04] the voice of the LORD thy God and will
[31:07] do that which is right in his sight and
[31:09] will give ear to His commandments and
[31:12] keep all his statutes I will put none of
[31:15] these diseases upon thee which I have
[31:18] brought upon the Egyptians for I am the
[31:21] Lord that healeth thee amen may God
[31:25] bless you bless the reading of his word
[31:27] as you're being seated tonight I want to
[31:29] continue with that thought on the Lord
[31:32] sweetens bitter waters and just to
[31:38] really draw our attention here within
[31:42] the the scriptures I I'm just so
[31:47] thankful to the Lord how that God he
[31:50] makes known his love and care and when I
[31:52] I look back and I see throughout the
[31:56] scriptures you know these are not just
[31:58] stories they are not just examples that
[32:02] happen but they are witnesses of God his
[32:08] abiding presence and his faithfulness to
[32:11] us as his believing children and I'm
[32:14] grateful for that
[32:15] that God would lead will give us these
[32:18] expressions that we can see and we
[32:21] are partakers of that in our own lives
[32:23] these these the bitter waters that they
[32:27] were brought to would be a
[32:28] representative of the test and the
[32:31] trials that that we would go through as
[32:34] as the people of God and tests and
[32:37] trials were aware that that a test and
[32:39] trial is not anything that is is not a
[32:43] punitive it's not punishment but a test
[32:46] and trial is therefore our molding and
[32:49] our shaping many of the times you know
[32:52] we we I believe as believers we would we
[32:55] gravitate to the place to examine our
[32:59] lives and say Lord is there anything
[33:01] that I've done within this is there
[33:04] anywhere that I'm falling short because
[33:07] brother Brennan would tell us that there
[33:08] is a tension that comes with being a
[33:11] believer in uniting time and sigh and he
[33:13] said you don't release tension you
[33:15] actually add tension to your life
[33:17] he said because as a believer he said
[33:19] you know when you were in the world you
[33:21] just went about your everyday life and
[33:23] everyone you didn't care but he said
[33:25] when he said you become a Christian he
[33:27] said the tension about your life is
[33:30] constantly every moment you are
[33:32] wondering am i pleasing to my Lord and
[33:35] brother branham would go on to put that
[33:38] out and he said it's like the automobile
[33:39] engine here is a belt that goes around
[33:42] all of the pulleys there and that belt
[33:44] itself is the kree is such attention and
[33:48] it's needed in order to make the car go
[33:51] down the road and brother Graham would
[33:53] come back around and say after all he
[33:54] said see Christian to us attention is a
[33:57] blessing to us as Christians it's a
[34:00] blessing that within our lives you know
[34:03] that the very first thing that we would
[34:05] think of is say Lord is there anything
[34:07] wrong is there anything out of step in
[34:10] my life because within that to know that
[34:13] God is faithful he God does not hold
[34:16] things from you and I he he does not
[34:19] keep anything back but if there is
[34:22] something that has has come up that is
[34:25] where where there is a correction that's
[34:29] coming God is faithful to guide us
[34:32] within correct
[34:33] because remember within this correction
[34:36] itself is not the joy god does not get
[34:40] joy from bringing correction but what
[34:43] God receives joy from is when the
[34:45] correction becomes reflected in our life
[34:48] and our lives become disciplined to the
[34:52] word and so this is the whole this is a
[34:54] whole purpose of it and as a believer we
[34:57] we have that tendency and maybe some
[35:00] more with a makeups and things that we
[35:02] have but yet within it to know that when
[35:04] our hearts are poured out like that and
[35:06] there is nothing that God would bring
[35:09] before us within our hearts then we can
[35:12] stand there and and to know that God he
[35:15] is directing everything he's over at all
[35:18] anyhow even when it's correction God's
[35:20] over it he's still in control but to
[35:23] realize that trials they are not they
[35:25] are not punishment that has come our way
[35:28] but rather it is directed by the hand of
[35:31] the Lord to think Israel in this
[35:33] scripture that we're reading here they
[35:35] are in the pathway to come into the
[35:39] promised land
[35:40] they're in the wilderness and there is
[35:42] many ways to go about and type it that
[35:44] when we recognize that they were coming
[35:47] into the promised land
[35:48] that would belong to them the promises
[35:52] and their inheritance that that was
[35:54] there within the land for you and I we
[35:57] we are dwelling in the promised land of
[36:00] the Holy Ghost in the revealed Word of
[36:04] the our baptized by one spirit into the
[36:08] body of Jesus Christ and we also are on
[36:12] our way to the promised land but it's
[36:14] not the promised land where there is
[36:16] wars and fighting but the promised land
[36:19] I'm talking about is in my father's
[36:21] house are many mansions the promised
[36:24] land that I'm talking about is is that
[36:26] as he said in Revelation 3:21 that as I
[36:30] overcome even as I overcome and I'm set
[36:32] down with my father in his throne
[36:34] so shouting you as you overcome sit down
[36:37] with me in my Father's throne we also
[36:40] have the promise that this corruption
[36:42] shall put on incorruption we have the
[36:44] promise that this vow
[36:46] body but the same God who changed our
[36:49] soul will also change this body to
[36:52] matchless on the inside we have that
[36:55] promise that we are coming into because
[36:58] we are not in a junction remember
[37:00] brother Brannon would point it like this
[37:02] in the future home and he would tell us
[37:04] he said the church is not called to a
[37:06] junction like Luther like Wesley and
[37:09] like that' Pentecost but we're not at a
[37:11] junction we are coming to the full
[37:13] promises of God what the others have
[37:17] waited and they have held fast to in the
[37:20] coming of the Lord the coming of the
[37:22] Lord is upon us
[37:23] there's not another age to come this is
[37:26] the age that the rapture is promised a
[37:28] man Enoch was the seventh from Noah it
[37:31] is promised in this hour the rapture to
[37:35] the Church of the Living God so in the
[37:37] meantime when we look at all these
[37:39] promises those are are very wonderful
[37:41] and they are glorious promises that
[37:44] pertain to us in this hour as the
[37:47] overcomers and yet to realize that there
[37:50] is the need through our journey just as
[37:54] God was taking Israel through the
[37:56] journey here this moment when they came
[37:59] to bitter waters was a moment for God to
[38:03] actually express his love and his power
[38:06] and it was for God to teach them and to
[38:09] train them now you know when we realize
[38:12] it you and I every experience we come
[38:15] through is to prepare us for another
[38:18] experience and another experience but
[38:20] all of those together are preparing for
[38:23] us to sit with him in his throne it is
[38:26] all preparing so it is all molding of
[38:29] our character and there's no other way
[38:32] for character to be molded other than
[38:34] through suffering and so when we look at
[38:37] this let me just take a few places in
[38:39] the scripture here tonight in first
[38:41] Peter chapter 1 verse 3 blessed be the
[38:44] God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[38:46] which according to his abundant mercy
[38:48] hath begotten us again unto a lively
[38:51] hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[38:55] from the dead aren't you glad it's a
[38:57] lively hope
[38:58] we've got a lively expectation by the
[39:01] resurrection of Jesus Christ from the
[39:03] dead because as he raised so have we
[39:06] raised in him so notice we this is the
[39:10] lively expectation we have to an
[39:13] inheritance incorruptible and undefiled
[39:16] and that fadeth not away reserved in
[39:19] heaven for you I want you to understand
[39:22] this has been reserved for you and it is
[39:26] still reserved for you the body is
[39:29] waiting all mine just as our spiritual
[39:33] body is being molded here in molding
[39:36] into the word image brother Bram
[39:38] suggests as there is a little spirit
[39:40] that comes next to the woman when she's
[39:42] getting ready to give birth
[39:44] he says for that spiritual body gets
[39:46] mere he said while we are being formed
[39:49] here there is a body that is prepared to
[39:51] theophany for when we step out of this
[39:53] line we go right into that theophany
[39:56] body God has everything prepared and
[39:59] arranged because within the theophany
[40:02] there would be no temptation but God
[40:05] here in this lifetime this is the
[40:08] proving grounds it's where everything is
[40:11] proven and and to think of how that all
[40:14] of this here the Bible goes on to say in
[40:17] verse 5 who are kept by the power of God
[40:20] through faith unto salvation ready to be
[40:23] revealed in the last time you wonder how
[40:25] you're sitting here this verse holds the
[40:27] answer you've been kept by the power of
[40:29] God you see the power of God in your
[40:32] life is not just power for you to stand
[40:35] when the enemy makes an affront but it
[40:37] also is power by that of life for you to
[40:40] be able to stand when circumstances
[40:42] around you are breaking all around you
[40:46] and to be able to stand and for his life
[40:48] to be reflected in our lives whether
[40:51] we're out whether we're down it is the
[40:54] life of Jesus Christ that is on display
[40:56] in our life there's no other way to
[40:58] explain it we have been kept and are
[41:00] kept by the power of
[41:03] amen it is faith that is the victory all
[41:06] mine and verse six now watch this
[41:08] wherein ye greatly rejoice we rejoice in
[41:14] that duly though now for a season
[41:23] you ever heard things where people say I
[41:26] hope we have a fall this year I
[41:28] hopefully have a spring this year I hope
[41:31] we have a hopefully have it you know
[41:33] this year hope it just don't go straight
[41:34] to winter people like transitions we all
[41:36] do right
[41:37] we like transitions because sometimes it
[41:40] seems like we don't have a fall we don't
[41:42] have a spring it seems like it goes from
[41:43] cold straight to hot right but yet
[41:46] sometimes if we're looking at that in
[41:48] terms of tests and trials I'd like to
[41:50] have a short spring sometimes I'd like
[41:53] to have a short fall sometimes but it's
[41:56] just a season and you know one thing
[42:00] about a season brother William you don't
[42:02] ever know I know our calendar says
[42:03] summer starts on June 21st we'll tell my
[42:07] skin when it was boiling back there in
[42:09] Memorial Day that summer starts in June
[42:11] 21st you with me but all that is set up
[42:14] on the lights in the heavens with me so
[42:19] now seasons themselves are just periods
[42:22] of time and remember even when Jesus was
[42:27] tempted the Bible says that the devil
[42:29] departed from him for a season so though
[42:35] now don't remember we greatly rejoice
[42:37] we've got a promise that's what we're
[42:41] rejoicing about though now for a season
[42:44] if need be and it ain't up to us to
[42:49] determine if it's necessary he's the one
[42:55] if need be ye are in heaviness through
[42:58] manifold temptation look at this word
[43:01] heaviness its to make sorrowful to
[43:04] affect with sadness cause grief to throw
[43:06] into sorrow and to make one uneasy calls
[43:09] him a scruple so why is this heaviness
[43:12] come about I'm rejoicing we're rejoicing
[43:14] and looking and what the promises that
[43:17] we are coming into but yet there is a
[43:19] heaviness at times that can surround our
[43:22] lives by the trial notice and then near
[43:26] the Bible says manifold temptations and
[43:28] there's many ways that Trials come our
[43:30] way there's a there's afflictions that
[43:32] can come in our body there is situations
[43:35] that can arise on our job there's so
[43:37] many different ways through many
[43:39] manifold temptations but notice the
[43:41] Bible says that the trial of your faith
[43:46] being much more precious than gold that
[43:49] perishes and though it be tried with
[43:51] fire might be found unto praise and
[43:54] honor and glory at the appearing of
[43:57] Jesus Christ whom having not seen you
[44:00] love in whom though you now you see him
[44:03] not yet believing you rejoice with joy
[44:05] unspeakable and full of glory receiving
[44:09] the end of your faith even the salvation
[44:10] of your souls so the trial of our faith
[44:14] our faith is more precious than gold
[44:17] let me just say it like this how would
[44:20] you know what you've really got unless
[44:22] it's put to the test
