[32:00] the different requests I know that were
[32:01] mentioned and uh want to say it's good
[32:04] to have well my father-in-law and
[32:07] mother-in-law they we didn't have church
[32:09] on Sunday so you didn't you didn't miss
[32:12] them but they wouldn't have been here if
[32:14] we'd had church and uh so they just
[32:17] everything kind of just suddenly hit
[32:19] them but U they've their many days
[32:21] removed but um this just there's a lot
[32:25] there's so many different things that
[32:27] are it's going on I just was in contact
[32:29] with brother
[32:31] Brian um Brian Hannah and
[32:35] um he's just it's really been difficult
[32:38] he's he's just getting over whatever it
[32:42] is Sister Barb seemed like she's got
[32:43] over it and then it's kind of went kind
[32:45] of seemed like it's kind of come back so
[32:47] and it's just you know we've had things
[32:49] like that kind of different you know
[32:50] it's just I don't even know how many
[32:52] different strains of the flu there are
[32:54] out there or whatever more when we can
[32:56] call every one of those Devils names
[32:59] but um it's just so much that is around
[33:02] but I I just uh certainly want to
[33:05] encourage you just to have prayer and I
[33:08] know you are but just as we can get it
[33:10] out when requ requests come in during
[33:12] the week we try to get it out and and I
[33:15] tell you
[33:16] if you know if I'm in need I I I want to
[33:19] get it out to the body um that to me is
[33:23] not being selfish I I've Got Confidence
[33:25] in your prayers and uh I so appre
[33:27] appreciate that and so we we certainly
[33:30] pray pray for one another and hold one
[33:32] another up in prayer and I know there's
[33:34] there like I said there's many that are
[33:35] dealing with it sometimes even some that
[33:37] won't uh they they don't come because
[33:40] maybe they've been exposed in the work
[33:42] and they're just kind of looking at
[33:44] things so let's just keep one another in
[33:46] prayer and really just you know just
[33:48] make it a matter of prayer the Lord will
[33:50] just just move for us in a special way
[33:52] we we really need a real touch from the
[33:55] Lord and um I want to also uh ask a
[33:59] prayer request I didn't get a chance to
[34:01] have this wrote down but um it's from
[34:03] Brother Sam rice from the Believers up
[34:05] there in Connecticut and um he'd asked
[34:08] that I remember um his uh friend in
[34:12] prayer Mike Gambier he has a a form of
[34:15] cancer and the Lord just really moved
[34:17] through that to um witness to that uh to
[34:22] that individual and he's been coming he
[34:24] was there uh when I was there and I got
[34:26] a chance to talk with him and his son uh
[34:29] after the service that day and kind of
[34:32] ran out there and tracked them down so I
[34:33] could talk with them and um they just
[34:37] asking that we would keep them in prayer
[34:39] as well because uh they're really
[34:41] looking at water baptism in the name of
[34:43] the Lord Jesus that's up in Connecticut
[34:45] and so um just remember them in prayer I
[34:48] know they're they're tuning in here

[35:35] one of you that're able to come out and

[36:00] will just just really speak to our
[36:02] hearts and and help us here
[36:05] tonight amen let's let's go here to
[36:08] Romans chapter 12 and I I wanted to read
[36:11] verses 1 through three but I just going
[36:13] to cut straight to verse
[36:15] four and Paul says for as we have many
[36:19] members in one body and all members have
[36:23] not the same office so we being many are
[36:27] one body in Christ and everyone members
[36:31] one of another having then gifts
[36:35] differing according to the grace that is
[36:38] given to us whether prophecy let us
[36:42] prophesy according to the prop
[36:44] proportion of Faith or
[36:47] Ministry let us wait on our ministry now
[36:51] this isn't that particular phrase there
[36:53] brother Bram will use that throughout
[36:55] and he'll use it in the question and
[36:57] answers on the Holy Ghost Church order
[37:00] 63 and he's dealing with that within
[37:03] each of our lives especially if there's
[37:05] those that would be um I want to say
[37:08] prone to be gifted uh in how that God
[37:11] has moved upon their lives and brother
[37:13] Braham he uses that term let us wait on
[37:16] our ministry we always want to be not
[37:18] just when it comes to gifts but we
[37:20] always want to be available to God let
[37:23] me just give you an example like this it
[37:25] would just be like for example if this
[37:27] coming weekend you know here brother
[37:30] George I he comes in the back office on
[37:32] Sunday morning he or calls me I can't
[37:36] talk now I pray that don't happen but
[37:40] you know there's there's got to be
[37:41] something to where and Paul would speak
[37:43] to us even as ministers to be in season
[37:45] and out of season but we I just say it
[37:47] in this way we always want to be ready
[37:51] you ever been in situations where you
[37:52] just don't feel ready and sometimes
[37:54] sometimes there's things that will come
[37:56] up that it just totally takes us you
[37:59] know we might you might be on the job or
[38:01] something comes up maybe they the way
[38:02] the morning has went or the day has went
[38:04] all of a sudden you get a call from your
[38:06] wife or somebody and you realize my I've
[38:08] really got to go to prayer about this
[38:10] well don't get defeated about because of
[38:14] what however the morning went just look
[38:17] to the Lord at that moment and say Lord
[38:19] forgive me if there's anything that I've
[38:21] I've said or done I make myself
[38:24] available to you Lord so don't just
[38:26] don't don't don't get caught up in the
[38:29] oh you know I wish I would have been
[38:30] more ready but just because sometimes
[38:32] things take us they take us unawares is
[38:35] that right but then there's other times
[38:36] when we know when we're coming to the
[38:38] house of God I want to be ready I want
[38:41] to be ready for what God has for me I
[38:43] don't know what God has but I I know I
[38:45] know he has something for me it might be
[38:47] to encourage me it may not be exactly
[38:49] the answer that I'm looking for I I just
[38:52] want to be ready I want to be available
[38:54] and that's where brother Bram and Paul
[38:56] was writing this let us wait on our
[38:58] ministry so for he that teacheth on
[39:02] teaching or he that exhorteth on
[39:05] exhortation let's just bow our heads in
[39:07] word of prayer Heavenly Father Lord we
[39:11] just want to say thank you for this
[39:12] evening thank you for my brothers and
[39:14] sisters Lord as the sacrifice that they
[39:18] Lord have made to be here father Lord

[39:32] hearts and help us to understand Lord

[39:37] you have given us to understand and I
[39:40] ask that Lord that you would just help
[39:42] me Lord give me the grace that I could
[39:44] just get out of the way that you could
[39:46] speak to our hearts and just speak and
[39:48] minister to our lives according to what

[39:53] every one Lord those different requests

[40:46] Lord we ask it father For Your Glory in
[40:50] Jesus precious name amen amen God bless
[40:54] you as you're being seated
[41:00] I want to I want to just pick up
[41:02] something here before I move forward in
[41:06] the subject here this evening and I want
[41:09] to I've I've kind of modified and had to
[41:12] add a few things to this on the flow of
[41:14] the service and I want you to as we've
[41:17] been dealing with some of these things
[41:19] on Church order these are just some
[41:21] things that as we said we just just as
[41:23] the Lord would lead us and just to
[41:25] minister upon these things these are
[41:27] things some of these things I know there
[41:28] are things that we know but I'll tell
[41:30] you even as I go back through things as
[41:32] God would lead us there's things that I
[41:34] just begin to see more clearly and uh
[41:37] things that I believe that as God just
[41:40] inspires to our hearts to help us as an
[41:43] assembly there's some things even
[41:45] tonight that I'll Minister on tonight
[41:47] that that really and I there's no way
[41:49] I'm going to get finished with it but I
[41:50] want to be able to lay certain things
[41:52] out and be able to start into it on what
[41:55] would even be a a Target and a direction
[41:57] for our lives and we talked about last
[42:00] week with on our approach and how that
[42:02] we when we come together and you know I
[42:05] I don't want you to be on pins and
[42:07] needles when you come together um you
[42:11] know I've been in situations like that
[42:13] too where you don't even know where to
[42:14] move or whatever more you have a some of
[42:16] you some of you communicated things to
[42:18] me where you've actually been in places
[42:20] in churches where you've got it's almost
[42:22] like uh the gastle is walking up and
[42:25] down the aisles you know and it's it's
[42:27] it's you know but that but I want to
[42:29] just say it like this every church is
[42:32] Sovereign but sovereignty I want to just
[42:35] I I don't want to deal with this so much
[42:37] tonight but sovereignty does not exempt
[42:40] us from the doctrine of the
[42:43] word sovereignty is sister Carmen God
[42:46] bless you good to see
[42:47] you sovereignty is like when brother bam
[42:50] talked about they did the penny March
[42:52] you dropped in like 25 pennies if you're
[42:54] 25 years old that's sovereignty that's
[42:57] not a doctrinal issue so it's not
[43:00] something of well that's a right or
[43:01] that's a wrong there's certain things
[43:03] there's certain things within
[43:04] sovereignty within the guidelines but
[43:07] one thing that is not really in question
[43:10] or that could be said well we're not
[43:12] going to believe this part of the
[43:13] message we're going to believe that part
[43:14] of the message that that's not
[43:16] sovereignty that's that's just called
[43:18] not going with the word but there are
[43:22] sometimes little peculiarities of
[43:23] certain things that might be a little
[43:25] different just like when we go visit
[43:26] another assembly you go to another
[43:28] assembly and but just go therefore with
[43:31] that purpose that Lord I've come here to
[43:33] receive from you it might do things a
[43:35] little bit different it's just like when
[43:37] when people come here and I certainly
[43:39] appreciate the respect or whatever more
[43:41] because if anyone did pull me toide I
[43:43] would just have to say you have to mind
[43:45] your own business this is this is an
[43:48] assembly and this is sovereignly this is
[43:50] what God has given us here and so even
[43:53] in in speaking this and I don't say that
[43:54] to be crude I'm just saying that you
[43:56] know cuz I understand sometimes I know
[43:59] that there you know can get up sometimes
[44:01] a person and they feel like they need to
[44:03] go and correct everybody and and they
[44:05] have it the best way but you know God
[44:07] knows even when you look at when I've
[44:09] been to places around the world they'
[44:11] been you know into Africa been the
[44:13] Philippines there things can be run and
[44:15] moved a little differently within there
[44:17] and even when you go into services but
[44:19] you'll find one thing that the spirit of
[44:22] God is the same sometimes the way things
[44:24] will will be done but you know what that
[44:26] you just you just get right in it you
[44:27] get right in the groove and I remember I
[44:29] was sitting in the Philippines the one
[44:30] time and brother roel leaned over to me
[44:32] and I was I was due to come and speak
[44:35] you know and and he leaned over to me
[44:37] and he said he said I'm sorry he said
[44:39] all the the specials that are going I
[44:41] said that's all right we'll just roll
[44:42] with it we're we're here let's just roll
[44:44] with it you know because I'm not going
[44:45] to get upset I don't want to I don't
[44:47] want to become a constricted Channel
[44:49] let's just roll with it we'll just see
[44:51] what God will do and I think that's the
[44:53] same thing that within our lives
[44:55] sometimes when we come to the house of
[44:56] God Satan is always in in in a way to
[44:59] want to try to distract us he knows
[45:01] what's coming he knows the word he knows
[45:04] what'll be ministered and he knows that
[45:06] even though it is something that uh that
[45:09] can be said that would be a great
[45:11] benefit to our lives and a help to us he
[45:13] knows just how to distract us you know
[45:15] he knows how to all of a sudden just
[45:16] drop a little thought in or maybe a
[45:18] certain song or maybe a piece of
[45:20] equipment or a sound or or something and
[45:23] just remember that he's always busy to
[45:26] try to get in and try to distract and
[45:29] this is why that when we're looking at
[45:31] reverence and I I want to if God would
[45:33] help me not tonight but another time
[45:35] looking at that on a broader Spectrum
[45:37] with reverence and respect and how that
[45:40] we look at things even deeper in the
[45:42] house of God with with things but to
[45:44] understand that there are there are
[45:46] things that when we like brother BR says
[45:48] when we come in out there I I don't know
[45:50] how many times and I want to just say
[45:52] this here when I'm back there many times
[45:54] in my office sometimes I'll have my my
[45:56] earbuds in and listening to music other
[45:58] times I'm not I'm just so focused and
[46:00] all of a sudden I hope that's okay
[46:02] brother Carlos all of a sudden I'll hear
[46:03] Brother Carlos's voice you know he's got
[46:05] like a booming voice you know he's he's
[46:07] about like this tall but he's got a
[46:08] booming voice like it's it's it's big
[46:11] and I'll hear that I'll hear them kind
[46:12] of chuckle a little bit and I hear
[46:14] Brother Bill and you know what it so
[46:16] warms my heart when I when I hear them
[46:19] out here and I hear the people some
[46:21] sometimes sister Stephanie's gathering
[46:22] in and they're out there just sitting
[46:24] right out there fellowshipping and I'm
[46:26] one I want my best to come out and greet
[46:28] him but I know that I I need to just
[46:30] there's a lot of things in front of me
[46:32] but what I'm saying is out there where
[46:33] brother BR says in here in the sanctuary
[46:36] this is where it's we we want to be
[46:39] reverent and only talking when
[46:41] absolutely necessary and as I said there
[46:43] are certain things that are absolutely
[46:45] necessary for the sound guys and Tech
[46:47] Guys and other things like that there's
[46:49] certain things that are necessary but
[46:52] like brother B says if there's something
[46:53] you have to say you can tap someone and
[46:55] we can greet One another out there in
[46:57] the foyer and I don't want it to be to
[46:59] where I mean obviously we're not it's
[47:01] not like we're having a fellowship
[47:02] dinner out there but also when we're in
[47:04] the foyer it's something that I I I
[47:06] don't want you to be where it's
[47:08] coldness it's never been that we we
[47:11] should greet one another because I've
[47:13] been places where you don't get
[47:14] greeted and then I've been at places
[47:17] where soon as you come to the door
[47:18] there's somebody right there and they're
[47:20] moving you all the way they're moving
[47:21] you through but there's a it's just
[47:23] greeting one another we I I think one
[47:25] way there's one thing of we look back
[47:27] even what Co did covid was one of those
[47:30] things that worked to destroy Fellowship
[47:33] things that we had worked so diligently
[47:35] on to bring people together but it it so
[47:38] worked against that and I think if
[47:39] there's one thing at all I don't have a
[47:41] problem with someone saying God bless
[47:42] you it's good to see you it's wonderful
[47:44] to see you and just you know and and but
[47:47] I think we understand and I hope those
[47:49] things were clear if it wasn't you can
[47:51] you can ask me but I think those are
[47:52] things are very are very clear we don't
[47:54] want people walking in here like robots
[47:56] and other things like that that's that's
[47:58] not how I want the the order of things
[48:00] to be I want it to be because listen as
[48:03] even it's been right now there is
[48:05] there's different ones that have come
[48:07] here sometimes they visit a couple times
[48:09] throughout the year and and I've heard
[48:10] others that come as strangers I never
[48:12] asked them this but they would tell me
[48:14] other pastors that would come and visit
[48:16] what a wonderful atmosphere and a
[48:19] freedom of worship there is and it would
[48:22] make the statement I just just had it
[48:23] made here just a there's just some some
[48:26] months ago what a what an atmosphere of
[48:29] of divine love I never asked him that
[48:31] and I I realized that that's not
[48:32] something that this building
[48:35] did that's something that moves from our
[48:38] hearts and that's what we always want to
[48:40] be I mean we always want that to be an
[48:43] emanating from our hearts we want it to
[48:45] be because first of all where does that
[48:47] come from it comes from God's love
[48:49] deposited in our life and we love him
[48:52] and then as we love him in that
[48:54] expression then there's a love for one
[48:56] another we love to see one
[48:59] another so in this flow of the service I
[49:03] also wanted to mention that you know
[49:04] there's times that if you you know even
[49:06] in needing uh to see me or anything like
[49:09] that just if you let the deacons know or
[49:11] you can text me or call me and say
[49:13] brother Samy do you mind after the
[49:14] service or something like that I I'm
[49:16] always available I'm available if
[49:18] there's something that I can't do or I
[49:19] see we need more time I'll always let
[49:22] you know on that but I just wanted to to
[49:24] set that forth I'm here we're always
[49:26] available and I want to touch this just
[49:28] a little bit before I dive into the
[49:30] subject here tonight on the flow of
[49:32] service and I've kind of broke this up
[49:34] more into like four parts here because
[49:36] that's really what it is and and that
[49:38] with the pre-service the one thing that
[49:40] I want to start here uh tonight and
[49:42] really kind of work with to bring to
[49:45] bring understanding in this because
[49:47] we've heard these things sometimes I've
[49:49] mentioned it a few times and we've
[49:51] talked about it but I want to deal with
[49:53] this part right here where gifted
[49:54] individuals meet and just to say it in
[49:57] this way we're not there
[49:59] yet but to understand how the prophet is
[50:03] placing it in the things that he's
[50:04] saying because sometimes it's been said
[50:07] well when they get completely mature but
[50:09] I I can see quotes that where the
[50:11] Prophet and go through these things and
[50:13] I'm not get through it all tonight but
[50:15] to show where all of this is at and to
[50:18] where that things can can actually be
[50:20] able to get to because with this here I
[50:23] I've also included this here cuz the
[50:25] financial report and that not something
[50:27] that is very spiritual but I'll say this
[50:31] if we don't get the bills paid we won't
[50:33] have no place together and so these are
[50:36] things that even injecting that there I
[50:39] we used to have I used to have it where
[50:40] they would put it in you know maybe
[50:42] before I came out or whatever more but
[50:44] you know brother Shane he had mentioned
[50:45] it kind of it brought it to my attention
[50:48] and after the first service and I
[50:49] appreciated that and I said yeah that's
[50:52] something I've been thinking about to
[50:53] try to get it down here as soon as we
[50:55] can and that's prior to the start of
[50:57] service if you have a even a testimony
[51:00] that's to be given that's when Sunday
[51:02] school would start but the financial
[51:04] report this Sunday uh the brothers are
[51:07] going to to give that very very quick
[51:09] just a few minutes that's all it is and
[51:11] it'll be before the service starts but
[51:14] we have to work that in and that's
[51:16] something only quarterly that we'll do I
[51:18] don't want and it's also things that I
[51:20] really don't want that out and over the
[51:22] Internet waves I don't want that out
[51:23] that's that's just inside housekeeping
[51:25] and there's no other place to really to
[51:27] fit that in so I trust that that is okay
[51:30] and then you know we I want to work here
[51:33] just a little bit and you're going to
[51:35] see this you're going to see what I have
[51:37] down here with messages and what I'm
[51:39] dealing with down here on this because
[51:41] I'm working to bring these two things
[51:42] here together where brother Bram says
[51:44] gifted individuals are to meet and
[51:46] you'll see how brother bradam is dealing
[51:47] with this as I get into this tonight but
[51:50] then also before everything could get it
[51:53] to where brother Brown him he had it
[51:54] like that before but before he could get
[51:57] it back to the back to this place where
[51:59] they met an hour 45 minutes beforehand
[52:02] we have it right here and after the
[52:04] ministering of the word where if it was
[52:08] tongues or interpretations or anything
[52:10] of that nature was to be given is that
[52:14] clear I just want to take my time and
[52:16] kind of drag my feet a little bit and
[52:18] just lay these things in so I want to
[52:19] just deal with tonight the order of
[52:23] spiritual gifts at least to start on
[52:25] this and and this is is a it's a great
[52:27] subject and I want to pull from where we
[52:29] are reading in the book of uh Romans and
[52:32] then let me just start in here on first
[52:35] 1 Corinthians 12 and Paul said there are
[52:38] diversities of gifts but the Same Spirit
[52:41] there are differences of administration
[52:44] but the same lord and there are
[52:46] diversities of operations but it's the
[52:49] same God which worketh all in all but
[52:52] the manifestation of the spirit is given
[52:55] to every man to profit with all to in
[52:58] other words it what God has dispensed or
[53:01] given it's to profit or to edify the
[53:05] body it's all about the body now he says
[53:09] for to one is given by the spirit the
[53:12] word of wisdom to another the word of
[53:14] knowledge by The Same Spirit to another
[53:17] Faith by The Same Spirit to another the
[53:20] gifts of healing by The Same Spirit to
[53:22] another the working of Miracles to
[53:24] another prophecy to another Discerning
[53:26] of spirits and to another diverse kinds
[53:29] of tongues and to another the
[53:31] interpretation of tongues but all these
[53:34] worketh that one and the self-same
[53:37] spirit dividing to every man severally
[53:41] as he will Paul goes on to say for as
[53:44] the body is one and hath many members
[53:48] and all the members of that body being
[53:50] many are one body so also is Christ for
[53:55] by one Spirit are are we all baptized
[53:57] into one body whether we be Jews or
[54:00] Gentiles whether we be Bond or free and
[54:03] have been all made to drink into one
[54:05] spirit for the body is not one member
[54:09] but many now you're familiar with this
[54:12] as script as Bible readers where Paul he
[54:16] he lays these things in with with the
[54:19] Corinthian Church where where he's
[54:21] letting them know that every member of
[54:25] the body it has its place and I I you
[54:29] know there are many things within the
[54:32] body we you know we Paul describe things
[54:35] in there that we see being used hands
[54:40] ears nose eyes but there's a lot of
[54:43] parts of the body uh there's many
[54:46] systems within the body and those
[54:48] systems work together if you didn't have
[54:51] systems that were in such as you know
[54:53] that of the circulatory system and resp
[54:56] system and brother Joshua you could help
[54:58] me out here all of those different
[55:00] systems are working together yet some of
[55:02] them are
[55:04] unseen yet they're unseen to the eye but
[55:07] you're seeing the effect of it right now
[55:09] you know that my heart is working
[55:11] because you can see the evidence it's
[55:13] kind of like you you've never seen the
[55:15] wind but you see the effects of the wind
[55:19] right you see the the leaves blow and
[55:22] that's the same thing that even
[55:24] throughout the body there are many
[55:26] different parts and you know it's one of
[55:28] those things that like remember when
[55:30] brother bradam uh those that were young
[55:32] men brother Bram would talk about they
[55:34] you know they were so enthused they were
[55:36] they were zous and and they said brother
[55:38] Ram should we go should we go seek for
[55:40] gifts brother Ram said no no no no no no
[55:42] he said you only become a stuff sh he
[55:44] said just he said just give yourself to
[55:47] the Lord just just continue to yield to
[55:50] the Lord take that Zeal and channel it
[55:52] in that way of a surrender so every one
[55:55] of us has a part there's things that's
[55:57] not even mentioned in here as far as
[56:00] singing and and so many parts within the
[56:03] body uh where God has given each of us a
[56:07] Ministry I could just take a time on
[56:09] this and and preach on this on just on
[56:11] how God has so sat within the whole body
[56:15] yet each one has an individual Ministry
[56:18] and God doesn't want us chasing after
[56:21] this or chasing after that remember the
[56:23] prophet takes the time during the
[56:24] adoption series and said that's the
[56:27] problem he said Ephraim is wanting to
[56:29] raise corn in manasseh's corner but God
[56:33] has has called us individually yet it's
[56:36] part of a body to work together for one
[56:40] purpose and that's the edification of
[56:43] the body of Jesus Christ and so when we
[56:46] look at all of these parts coming
[56:48] together I I think of these two words
[56:50] what an entrustment when I read those
[56:52] scriptures and what a
[56:54] responsibility because every every one
[56:56] of us that have been baptized into the
[56:59] body of Jesus Christ with his Spirit we
[57:03] have that order by God let us wait on
[57:06] our
[57:08] ministry we have we've been entrusted
[57:11] those gifts are right here in the
[57:16] body because you understand when we when
[57:19] we have been baptized into the body of
[57:23] Jesus Christ those gifts are already
[57:25] there in the body
[57:26] body Now watch how brother Brandon would
[57:29] would bring this around and and he and
[57:32] he says it in this way in the angel and
[57:34] his commission he says in the body of
[57:36] Christ through all these nine spiritual
[57:38] gifts any group of people any Gathering
[57:41] of Holiness people that believe in
[57:44] Christ has the right to have the nine
[57:47] spiritual gifts it circles through the
[57:50] body it's in the body it's not a Praying
[57:54] individual it'll be on this one here
[57:56] night and that one the next night and
[57:58] maybe over here another time so notice
[58:01] it's in the body it's circling through
[58:04] the body and yet you'll find brother
[58:07] Brandon mentioned things like just
[58:09] reading here in Gabriel's uh the the 70
[58:12] weeks of Daniel and brother Bram he'll
[58:14] say things such as like with brother
[58:15] higin botam he usually has the gift of
[58:18] tongues and brother B will speak to that
[58:21] in that well you know it usually or or
[58:24] because because why these are in
[58:26] individuals where that maybe it's been
[58:28] it's been that of tongues or prophecy
[58:30] has seeming to be prominently moving
[58:33] through them but the prophet said it's
[58:35] here in the body it's circling through
[58:37] the body so that that is different than
[58:41] five ministerial gifts the five ministri
[58:43] of gifts those are gifts that you are
[58:45] born with that gift in you you're born
[58:49] with that whether it's a a pastor a you
[58:52] know teacher evangelist Prophet you're
[58:54] born with that gift within you it is not
[58:56] something that that comes in you even
[58:58] those that are a songwriter those who
[59:00] sing specials gifts and callings are
[59:02] without repentance meaning the gift was
[59:04] in you before you ever
[59:07] repented this is why that the many of
[59:10] the songwriters that have yielded their
[59:13] talents to writing
[59:15] songs that have led young people and led
[59:18] others astray they'll have to answer for
[59:23] that never forget when I sat there in a
[59:26] music class that I was in uh for going
[59:29] through Elementary teaching and and this
[59:31] my my teacher was there I guess he liked
[59:33] the
[59:34] Beatles or something because he was
[59:37] overhead after overhead displaying all
[59:40] these songs that he wrote and only I
[59:41] could think of is is when he's talking
[59:43] about all these songs that they wrote
[59:45] and especially that of the one I don't
[59:47] want to call his name oh I can think of
[59:49] his oh God thousands of songs that's
[59:52] nothing to brag on that's sentences
[59:56] because of while they've yielded a
[59:58] talent that God gave them but yielded it
[1:00:02] in the wrong direction yeah oh God be
[1:00:08] merciful notice brother Bron says the
[1:00:12] this person can pray the prayer of faith
[1:00:15] tonight and maybe it's on this one over
[1:00:17] here the next night it's a gift that's
[1:00:21] in the body working around to you all
[1:00:24] Milling through the body body nine
[1:00:27] spiritual gifts this one might prophesy
[1:00:30] tonight and he says this is where we get
[1:00:32] in trouble you'll find brother ROM we'll
[1:00:35] continue to bring this point up over and
[1:00:38] over this is where we get in trouble one
[1:00:40] might prophesy and tell the truth that
[1:00:43] doesn't make you a prophet it might
[1:00:45] never come to you
[1:00:47] again it may never it may never move
[1:00:49] through that person again but you see
[1:00:51] brother brandom is bringing the
[1:00:53] difference prophecy does not make
[1:00:55] something one a
[1:00:57] prophet prophets are born are born of
[1:01:01] God the gift was within them but
[1:01:03] prophecy and then this can become the
[1:01:05] danger that when something has been
[1:01:08] spoken through a life and let's say that
[1:01:11] it is indeed has been judged and proven
[1:01:14] to be true it does not mean that from
[1:01:17] henceforth everything that comes out of
[1:01:19] their mouth is thus sayith the Lord
[1:01:22] every time it's got to be checked when
[1:01:26] it's
[1:01:27] prophecy that's where it gets in
[1:01:30] trouble that's what the prophet would
[1:01:35] say and he's bringing let me just let me
[1:01:38] continue to lay this in here in the
[1:01:41] message expectation the prophet says
[1:01:43] these gifts and callings are without
[1:01:44] repentance there is Spirits that's in
[1:01:47] the church that's true such as gifts of
[1:01:50] Prophecy healing and so forth so it's a
[1:01:52] spirit of God but he's
[1:01:54] Diversified so it can move through
[1:01:57] within that of Prophecy or tongues or or
[1:01:59] healing but they're in the entire body
[1:02:03] they may fall upon one person tonight A
[1:02:05] Prophecy it may not never fall on that
[1:02:08] person again it might be somewhere else
[1:02:10] in the body and those Spirits are
[1:02:12] supposed to be judged let one speak and
[1:02:16] two or three judge said Paul brother BR
[1:02:19] says now those are the spirits of the
[1:02:22] gifts that's in the church but the only
[1:02:24] person that has a right to say thus
[1:02:27] sayith the Lord is a Vindicated Prophet
[1:02:30] you never seen anybody judging Isaiah
[1:02:32] Jeremiah or those people they were
[1:02:35] prophets for ordained and born in the
[1:02:37] world to be prophets and they foresaw
[1:02:40] The Thing by a vision and then said thus
[1:02:42] sayith the Lord for the Lord had already
[1:02:44] said
[1:02:45] it now why when brother Bram would go
[1:02:49] into this he's going into this for a
[1:02:52] certain reason first of all he is the
[1:02:55] Church age
[1:02:57] messenger and furthermore has being the
[1:03:00] church age messenger God himself had
[1:03:03] promised to restore us back to the faith
[1:03:06] of the
[1:03:07] fathers because restoration of the gifts
[1:03:11] never produced a
[1:03:14] bride it was a part A further part of
[1:03:18] here the
[1:03:19] supernal being declared among the people
[1:03:23] now remember brother Ram tells us that
[1:03:25] even Martin lther Luther he spoke in
[1:03:27] tongues but he said I won't teach it in
[1:03:29] my church because he said if I do
[1:03:31] there'll be people chasing after that
[1:03:34] instead of after The Giver himself
[1:03:37] remember even brother Ram talks about
[1:03:39] even how when Dwight Moody he was
[1:03:41] preaching and he broke into speaking in
[1:03:43] tongues he was in such an inspiration
[1:03:45] and he he asked God Lord please forgive
[1:03:48] me for for for speaking that and and you
[1:03:50] know these are men it wasn't their
[1:03:52] season or their hour but I'll say the
[1:03:55] things that they said are still
[1:03:57] applicable to this day because you see
[1:04:01] friends this is where that even within
[1:04:04] when we look at these spiritual gifts
[1:04:07] it's very very very crucial because the
[1:04:09] prophet will say it in multiple places
[1:04:12] questions and answers on the Holy Ghost
[1:04:13] is one place he said you he said
[1:04:16] everywhere the children of God
[1:04:18] congregate the devil congregates as well
[1:04:22] Spirits are because remember when God in
[1:04:25] job called the sons of God together
[1:04:28] Satan walked right up in that Gathering
[1:04:31] so we're not ignorant of that and it's
[1:04:33] not to scare us but if we're just
[1:04:35] reverent to God and looking to the Lord
[1:04:38] and realizing whenever he wants if he
[1:04:42] however God wants to use me I don't need
[1:04:45] to do anything not one thing to make
[1:04:49] myself more pleasing to him his blood
[1:04:52] has already did all that was necessary
[1:04:56] huah but if he should see fit if there's
[1:04:58] something or some way that he can use me
[1:05:01] Lord I want to be available I don't want
[1:05:04] to have to say Lord sorry you can't use
[1:05:06] me today you'll have to get somebody
[1:05:09] else I want to be available it's kind of
[1:05:13] like your favorite coffee cup and
[1:05:15] somebody has got in your house and used
[1:05:21] it and drink their favorite Coke
[1:05:23] beverage out of it and here you go to
[1:05:25] get your mug that is a it's just it's
[1:05:27] just that's what makes the coffee taste
[1:05:29] good and you go and look in the sink and
[1:05:31] somebody has used it and it's not
[1:05:36] available this is why within our lives
[1:05:40] we always want to be available and not
[1:05:42] just in the house of God but how do you
[1:05:44] know a life that we might not come
[1:05:46] across out here tomorrow Lord I always
[1:05:50] want to be
[1:05:51] available I want to be available to you
[1:05:54] this is where the Prophet when he
[1:05:55] speaking of it he goes on to say
[1:05:58] intested faith produces goods CU he
[1:06:01] keeps on bringing this whole thing up
[1:06:03] and he says he calls some of us to
[1:06:05] preach some of us to teach some of us
[1:06:08] with different spirits of operation
[1:06:10] there's nine nine spiritual gifts in the
[1:06:12] local body there's a gift of Prophecy
[1:06:15] that could be on any person in here
[1:06:17] tonight and may be never on them again
[1:06:21] that just comes and goes I'll tell you
[1:06:24] what that understand in does for me is
[1:06:27] it can get the devil off of your back
[1:06:29] because when you get to look and say
[1:06:31] well I maybe I haven't been used like
[1:06:33] this in a way in a while maybe God has
[1:06:37] only used you in a certain way for a
[1:06:39] certain time right I mean even with John
[1:06:42] the Baptist for he went went for how
[1:06:44] many years and he was only used for six
[1:06:47] months the Lord Jesus and his ministry
[1:06:50] 30 years but he was only used three and
[1:06:52] 1/2 years yeah is that right
[1:06:56] it's kind of like this forgive me I know
[1:06:58] I'm very very simple I could have put a
[1:06:59] picture up there but I thought no I'm
[1:07:01] just going to do this and bring out my
[1:07:02] little little little bag of things that
[1:07:04] I have in my office back here I want you
[1:07:07] to notice every one of these things I've
[1:07:09] got in
[1:07:10] here I've got a carpenter's knife
[1:07:13] sometimes I need that for things I have
[1:07:14] to
[1:07:15] open I don't use this for
[1:07:18] counseling only when it has blades and
[1:07:20] I'm just
[1:07:20] eing I got scissors I got a stapler
[1:07:25] I have the Post-it notes which Lord
[1:07:28] knows I need those all the time almost
[1:07:31] remember to read your Post-It note you
[1:07:32] have to make a post- notee for you
[1:07:33] posted notes I got a pen these are all
[1:07:37] instruments it's like
[1:07:39] gifts they're right there in my office
[1:07:43] if if I take a notion and something
[1:07:45] comes up and I I I need to trim
[1:07:48] something out or I have to cut something
[1:07:49] I know where to go I've got the scissors
[1:07:52] they're already in a position they're
[1:07:53] not just you know laying around these
[1:07:55] aren't just in a bag like I have them
[1:07:57] here like when I go to brother Shane's
[1:07:59] house I don't take the bag and say Hey
[1:08:00] Brother Shane let me show you what I've
[1:08:02] got in here let me show you all these
[1:08:03] gifts I don't do that the gifts have
[1:08:05] come they're in position in my office
[1:08:09] you see that you see what I'm saying
[1:08:10] putting them in that way and so when I
[1:08:12] have need of my pen it's there I don't
[1:08:16] need my pen all the time I don't go into
[1:08:19] a day when I come here on on on the six
[1:08:23] days out of the week I do not come in
[1:08:24] here and say today I got to use my pen
[1:08:26] if I don't use my pen it's not been a
[1:08:29] successful day in the office I don't
[1:08:32] know that day might be mainly just on
[1:08:36] the computer which that's generally of
[1:08:39] all the hours it's here within that and
[1:08:41] you know I've got other markers in there
[1:08:42] that I use and you know what this thing
[1:08:44] I I think I use this today for one thing
[1:08:47] but that's the first time today this
[1:08:48] stapler has been used in a long
[1:08:52] time you with me but it's things that it
[1:08:55] just so in other words I I don't I you
[1:08:57] know the stapler or I'm not saying oh I
[1:09:00] I didn't have a day in the office
[1:09:01] because I wasn't able to use the stapler
[1:09:03] today it's there and when I need to use
[1:09:07] it it's for a purpose I don't just walk
[1:09:09] through the office just clicking away
[1:09:11] and Staples going everywhere all over
[1:09:13] the floor see I I did that once when I
[1:09:16] was a kid but I'm no longer a
[1:09:19] child I know when to use
[1:09:22] it uh you know I'm not I'm not enamored
[1:09:24] with it like oh I've got a stapler yeah
[1:09:27] first I mean you know especially some of
[1:09:28] the nicer staplers and things you can
[1:09:30] have and you know then when you become a
[1:09:32] teacher and you get one like this and it
[1:09:33] opens you're like oh man wow that's a
[1:09:36] neat man there's more I can use it to
[1:09:38] make bulletin boards which I never was
[1:09:40] good at I can do all of that right there
[1:09:43] but you know after a while I I I don't
[1:09:46] come in and study this no more it's
[1:09:49] there when I need it I use it and that's
[1:09:53] the same way that God through these
[1:09:57] gifts God uses it as he needs
[1:10:01] it it might be once
[1:10:04] twice a
[1:10:07] year in some of these that I'm going to
[1:10:09] speak about tonight so it isn't
[1:10:12] something that it it has to be it's as
[1:10:16] needed so this is where it comes down
[1:10:20] the our rest is in the Lord Jesus
[1:10:23] Christ if I never had another good day
[1:10:26] I'm
[1:10:27] saved brother R said if I never preached
[1:10:30] again I'm going to heaven so I'm I'm not
[1:10:33] resting on a gift I'm not resting on a
[1:10:36] feeling I'm resting on I have met the
[1:10:39] that that's that saving redeeming work
[1:10:41] and it's here in my heart I love him
[1:10:45] he's the love of my life his word is
[1:10:47] what I desire to
[1:10:49] [Applause]
[1:10:52] follow is that all right
[1:10:55] it just comes and goes it's as he sees
[1:10:58] fit it's not us determining it oh if it
[1:11:02] doesn't go this way it's it's not been a
[1:11:03] good service no when he comes and he
[1:11:07] comes through so many different
[1:11:09] ways this is why brother BR you know
[1:11:12] when he talked about teaching sometimes
[1:11:14] I know man I'm kind of getting off here
[1:11:15] a little bit I need to stay a little
[1:11:17] more focused but sometimes you know
[1:11:19] teaching has taken such a bad rap
[1:11:22] sometimes and the reality of it is the
[1:11:25] prophet tells us he takes us in the
[1:11:27] scripture and he says many don't
[1:11:29] understand what the anointing is he said
[1:11:31] the anointing is not running all over
[1:11:33] the building which I'm not against
[1:11:35] running but he said anointing is knowing
[1:11:37] how and when to
[1:11:40] act and he said the Lord Jesus he said
[1:11:44] here he did he stood up read a scripture
[1:11:47] and sat down and wonderful words
[1:11:50] proceeded from his mouth I'm wondering
[1:11:52] how many of our meetings if someone sat
[1:11:55] down on the platform and
[1:11:57] preached you see sometimes where God
[1:11:59] brings us to because sometimes we want
[1:12:02] to be careful we're not getting caught
[1:12:04] up in somebody else's
[1:12:06] Spirit we're getting in the spirit
[1:12:08] because somebody else's spirit will
[1:12:09] never heal me it'll never touch me it'll
[1:12:11] never deliver me but if I can get in his
[1:12:13] Spirit enter into the spirit of the
[1:12:17] word you understand what I'm saying
[1:12:20] because when the word is meant to have
[1:12:22] an effect upon our lives right we can
[1:12:25] leave out and say it's a good service
[1:12:27] but the real results of it being a good
[1:12:29] service is that the word it has become
[1:12:32] good it has changed our lives it's
[1:12:35] working it's outworking in our lives
[1:12:37] that's the purpose when we come to the
[1:12:40] house of God and that the word might
[1:12:42] have an outlet to work
[1:12:44] through we want to be available I want
[1:12:46] to be
[1:12:48] available available to God can we say
[1:12:52] that available available I that's what I
[1:12:55] want to be I want to be
[1:12:59] available brother brah is talking about
[1:13:01] these gifts and he says it you know in
[1:13:03] the one place in questions and answers
[1:13:06] on the Holy Ghost he says it like this
[1:13:07] he says you know he said sometimes see
[1:13:09] brother Bram was seing so many things of
[1:13:11] how that when the gifts were being done
[1:13:13] and he's seeing it throughout all in not
[1:13:15] just in the Tabernacle but he's seeing
[1:13:17] it throughout all other churches you
[1:13:19] said brother Samuel I thought that you
[1:13:22] said sovereignty was for the local
[1:13:23] church for for every
[1:13:26] pastor but I'm talking about a
[1:13:29] prophet as a pastor I don't go correct
[1:13:31] another
[1:13:32] Pastor that's their Church that'd be
[1:13:35] like me coming into your home and
[1:13:37] correcting your children that's
[1:13:40] wrong right it'd be like me coming
[1:13:42] coming to you as a husband and stripping
[1:13:45] you down in front of your wife that's
[1:13:46] wrong you're the leader of that home I
[1:13:48] don't ever want that image to be
[1:13:51] tarnished are you with me there's a way
[1:13:54] we work but we're dealing with a prophet
[1:13:57] a prophet is sent to bring and place the
[1:14:00] church in order and we're not talking
[1:14:04] about in this ministry and Ephesians 4
[1:14:07] Prophet we're talking about a prophet
[1:14:09] like that of
[1:14:11] Moses we're talking about an end time
[1:14:14] Prophet that God declared I will send
[1:14:17] unto you Elijah the prophet and Elijah
[1:14:19] came on the mountain by the word he had
[1:14:22] a vision of the word and that's what a
[1:14:25] Prophet has a prophet the prophet says
[1:14:27] goes beyond the emotion of the people he
[1:14:30] goes beyond the music he climbs up into
[1:14:33] the Realms of God and he hears what has
[1:14:36] already been
[1:14:38] said and Echoes it to the Church of the
[1:14:41] Living God that's the gift of a prophet
[1:14:44] he's a Seer he's an eagle and he brings
[1:14:47] it down into the church and now what is
[1:14:50] in Heavenly becomes
[1:14:52] displayed through the Earthly in an
[1:14:55] orderly way this is why even on the
[1:14:58] mountain Elijah never brought his own
[1:15:01] stones but what was there it was
[1:15:04] assembled back
[1:15:06] together God led him what to do so this
[1:15:09] is why when the prophet would say it in
[1:15:10] this way he says in questions and
[1:15:12] answers on the Holy Ghost and I don't I
[1:15:15] I didn't I just want to reference to
[1:15:17] this this this particular statement on
[1:15:19] being available brother Bram says when
[1:15:23] that comes into the congregation and he
[1:15:25] says that tongues he said you be
[1:15:28] reverent and he said because you might
[1:15:32] be the one that gives the
[1:15:37] interpretation you be
[1:15:39] reverent because it's because I don't
[1:15:42] want to I can't dive into those parts
[1:15:44] tonight it's so hard not to get into all
[1:15:46] these other parts as
[1:15:47] you but all of those things it's not
[1:15:50] things of what we're even thinking even
[1:15:52] when it's spoken in tongues it's not our
[1:15:54] thoughts about things even the
[1:15:57] interpretation interpretation is not
[1:16:00] what is not our Impressions
[1:16:02] interpretation is where we hear it in
[1:16:04] our native
[1:16:06] language and speak it
[1:16:08] out that's interpretation it's not
[1:16:11] feeling of what I feel like the church I
[1:16:13] feel like no no it's
[1:16:17] clarity now look how brother brandham
[1:16:20] brings this
[1:16:22] here bringing all these things together
[1:16:24] as Paul would say concerning spiritual
[1:16:26] gift Brethren I would not have you
[1:16:29] ignorant I'm thankful for that aren't
[1:16:32] you you know it's evident when Paul
[1:16:34] would be dealing with the Corinthian
[1:16:36] Church and bringing this correction and
[1:16:40] guidance now he admonished him the very
[1:16:42] the chapter one when he opened up he
[1:16:44] said the testimony of Christ was
[1:16:46] confirmed in you you are you have not
[1:16:48] come behind in any gift yeah all
[1:16:50] utterance they they had the gifts among
[1:16:53] them now I want just I want to just ask
[1:16:55] you this question here I know brother
[1:16:57] Brad will say this over and over he says
[1:16:59] how that you know Paul never had to
[1:17:01] speak to the Ephesian church about the
[1:17:02] gifts and he never had to speak to this
[1:17:05] church but I look at it this
[1:17:08] way if this hadn't been an
[1:17:12] issue what what what what leadership
[1:17:14] would we have had you see God takes
[1:17:17] things that that can become that that we
[1:17:19] look at oh this shouldn't be and this
[1:17:21] this issue no no God takes it and solves
[1:17:24] it out right he solves things out for
[1:17:27] you and I he brings that because in
[1:17:29] reality every Church Ephesus included
[1:17:33] had its weaknesses and its strengths
[1:17:37] galatia thessalonica it's it's right
[1:17:39] there I I don't have time for that but
[1:17:42] each one had their strengths and
[1:17:43] weaknesses just like you and I as
[1:17:45] individuals have our own strengths and
[1:17:47] weaknesses just like a husband and a
[1:17:50] wife we all have our strengths and
[1:17:52] weaknesses in other words we're all
[1:17:55] flowed human beings in need of God's
[1:17:59] divine
[1:18:00] grace and God takes things that
[1:18:04] sometimes you and I say oh it shouldn't
[1:18:05] be this way and we revisit it and we and
[1:18:08] God comes in and he speak to our hearts
[1:18:10] so personally in our lives listen You'll
[1:18:12] Find as I go through some of these years
[1:18:14] in here you'll find where the Prophet is
[1:18:17] going through and having to revisit
[1:18:19] these things again and again and you'll
[1:18:22] find that it's not just at the time
[1:18:24] Tabernacle but he's speaking in many
[1:18:28] different locations because he's the
[1:18:30] prophet to the age if you can understand
[1:18:33] this there's places that when I when I
[1:18:36] would go in to minister as a as a guest
[1:18:38] Minister I don't go in as a pastor yet
[1:18:40] that's the gift in my life that a lot of
[1:18:42] that will will come forth even in the
[1:18:44] approach to the word but I'm not there
[1:18:46] to Pastor those people there's certain
[1:18:48] places I won't even Venture I won't even
[1:18:50] go into because I'm not their Pastor
[1:18:53] there's certain places and things that
[1:18:54] we stand that to me is the reverence for
[1:18:58] the
[1:18:59] pulpit are you with me I'm I it's there
[1:19:02] as God would lead to edify to encourage
[1:19:04] the people and that's and this is where
[1:19:06] we're at so notice we want I want to be
[1:19:08] thankful for the correction that God had
[1:19:10] given and notice Paul says this follow
[1:19:13] after charity and desire spiritual gifts
[1:19:16] but rather that you may prophesy so he's
[1:19:19] telling them what to put first go after
[1:19:21] charity and then desire spiritual gifts
[1:19:23] but rather that you may
[1:19:25] prophesy even so for as much as you are
[1:19:28] zealous of spiritual gifts seek that you
[1:19:30] may excel to the edifying of the church
[1:19:34] now I want to look at this this word of
[1:19:37] pro prophecy or to prophesy and this is
[1:19:39] what Paul is referring
[1:19:41] to this is where it is it's a discourse
[1:19:45] emanating from divine inspiration and
[1:19:48] declaring the purposes of God now
[1:19:52] tongues and the interpretation of T is
[1:19:56] prophecy okay so this is what true
[1:20:00] prophecy is its discourse emanating from
[1:20:03] divine inspiration declaring the
[1:20:05] purposes of God and here's the way it
[1:20:07] goes by reproving and admonishing the
[1:20:11] wicked comforting The Afflicted and
[1:20:14] revealing things hidden this is why God
[1:20:18] has placed this in the
[1:20:21] church now brother bradam will take this
[1:20:25] very thing right here with prophecy and
[1:20:27] who better to disclose or to discuss
[1:20:30] this than a prophet because he says the
[1:20:32] way that it does here on the platform he
[1:20:36] said you've never seen it repeat
[1:20:38] scriptures it's a direct
[1:20:42] message that's the same way that
[1:20:46] prophecy as a spiritual gift will work
[1:20:50] through the
[1:20:53] body is that all
[1:20:57] right so I thank God for that I thank
[1:21:01] God for that the prophet lyans are like
[1:21:02] this he said he said take for example he
[1:21:04] says you've got someone here and they're
[1:21:06] coming for prayer and they they Lord I I
[1:21:09] brother BR I don't know or brother
[1:21:10] Neville I don't know what's going on you
[1:21:12] know and so he says God has one has a
[1:21:15] gift in the body and if that that gift
[1:21:17] is there to go down maybe there's
[1:21:19] something in that life they've got to
[1:21:22] make
[1:21:23] right and God will use that I tell you
[1:21:26] that's not to embarrass people that's to
[1:21:29] help God's
[1:21:31] children think about that little lady
[1:21:33] who was a Sunday school teacher her
[1:21:35] husband was a deacon across
[1:21:37] town and both of them have been guilty
[1:21:41] of
[1:21:42] adultery and she had so said well I
[1:21:45] asked God to forgive me she couldn't
[1:21:46] figure out what was going on in her life
[1:21:48] she was such a nervous wreck and
[1:21:50] everything else about her life and
[1:21:53] finally when the angel of the Lord came
[1:21:54] the one day the prophets told meeting go
[1:21:57] get her and bring her to the office here
[1:21:58] at the house and when she came in the
[1:22:00] spirit of God uncovered where her
[1:22:03] problem
[1:22:05] was you know when I read that story I
[1:22:08] say God thank you for your mercy it was
[1:22:11] God freeing that little
[1:22:14] lady she wanted to be free she did what
[1:22:18] she thought and there was also a fear if
[1:22:20] I disclose this said she had pressed it
[1:22:23] down there so far but God had that of a
[1:22:28] prophet that he used in that moment to
[1:22:30] go down there and
[1:22:32] remove what was hindering
[1:22:35] her that's the same
[1:22:37] way one of the channels that prophecy as
[1:22:41] one of the nine spiritual gifts will be
[1:22:47] used brother Bram goes through that in
[1:22:49] different ones now watch in Hebrews
[1:22:52] chapter 7 brother Bram says when you go
[1:22:54] into to a
[1:22:56] meeting and you know you go in there and
[1:22:58] there's a bunch of tongues and
[1:22:59] interpretations and somebody raises up
[1:23:01] and keeps quoting the scripture that's
[1:23:04] carnal now one thing you're not going to
[1:23:06] find I want don't want to dwell on this
[1:23:07] tonight but just things that I've just
[1:23:09] you know you Ponder on you look at I've
[1:23:11] never found brother brandham un
[1:23:14] christianized one person who was out of
[1:23:18] line some weeks ago I just woke up early
[1:23:21] in the morning it just began to come
[1:23:22] back asz I was just looking at that I
[1:23:24] thought even how brother brandham when I
[1:23:26] can show I if God gives us opportunities
[1:23:29] later on to show you even times after he
[1:23:32] said certain statements he'll be out
[1:23:34] preaching somewhere else and somebody
[1:23:36] will interrupt but he'll never say
[1:23:38] anything negative about that he'll say
[1:23:40] oh he says let's be reverenced because
[1:23:42] evidently the Holy Spirit wanted to say
[1:23:44] something because he broke in on the
[1:23:46] message that was out of order right but
[1:23:49] look how the prophet handled
[1:23:51] that he never called it of the devil
[1:23:55] right I want you to watch that to me I
[1:23:58] watch the character I watch his approach
[1:24:00] I watch I watch all of these things as
[1:24:02] it comes and watch he said that's that's
[1:24:04] carnal God said for us not to use vain
[1:24:07] reputations what about him if he wrote
[1:24:09] it here once you believe it he don't
[1:24:11] have to say it again tongues and
[1:24:13] interpretations is right but it's to be
[1:24:16] a direct message to the church and to
[1:24:18] somebody not just carnal and things like
[1:24:21] that so it's not like brother says
[1:24:24] somebody asked brother BR should I be
[1:24:26] baptized he said that's wrote in the
[1:24:28] word the Lord is coming that's in the
[1:24:31] word that's I'm right on for a preacher
[1:24:34] to be saying
[1:24:35] that but not
[1:24:38] for that to be called prophecy because
[1:24:41] that's not
[1:24:45] prophecy Now watch how Paul writes this
[1:24:48] in 1 Corinthians 14:23 I'm trying to
[1:24:51] move Paul said if therefore the whole
[1:24:53] church be come together into one place
[1:24:55] and all speak with tongues and there
[1:24:57] come in those that are unlearned or
[1:24:59] unbelievers will they not say that you
[1:25:01] are mad but if all prophesy and there
[1:25:05] come in one that believeth not or one
[1:25:07] unlearned he is
[1:25:10] convinced of all he is judged of all and
[1:25:15] thus are the secrets of his heart made
[1:25:18] manifest so falling down on his face he
[1:25:21] will worship God and report that God is
[1:25:24] in in you of a
[1:25:26] truth so when we look at this no one
[1:25:29] this is remember now let me just let me
[1:25:31] move a little bit this is one of the
[1:25:33] parts of Prophecy because it's also used
[1:25:36] to comfort The Afflicted but here to
[1:25:39] convince it's to tell one's fault which
[1:25:42] is what I was just talking about right
[1:25:43] here if there's something that's laying
[1:25:46] in a life God has a way of doing
[1:25:51] that and I can't read it here to you
[1:25:54] tonight but brother brandham was so
[1:25:55] thankful when he returned home and he
[1:25:58] saw that gift of Prophecy working in
[1:26:00] brother Neville's life and brother Brown
[1:26:02] says it like this God has sent me some
[1:26:05] relief some help here at home so when
[1:26:09] I'm home I can
[1:26:11] rest there had also come correction
[1:26:14] brother Neville that's a different story
[1:26:17] but the main thing is that here in the
[1:26:19] here in the word even judged to be
[1:26:22] judged see it has to be judged
[1:26:24] everything to investigate to examine to
[1:26:27] inquire in a forensic sense you know in
[1:26:30] a forensic sense it's going down and
[1:26:32] examining it so when something is just
[1:26:36] said it comes right out and says uh
[1:26:38] brother Shane do not go to your job
[1:26:41] tomorrow this and this will be you don't
[1:26:43] receive that it's got to be judged
[1:26:48] first that's scripture you saying well
[1:26:51] it called it right out by name it must
[1:26:53] be judged that that's the scripture two
[1:26:55] two out of the three must judge it see
[1:26:59] this is why for more gifts gifts is not
[1:27:01] just tongues interpretation there's got
[1:27:02] to be that of
[1:27:04] discernment among us to be able to
[1:27:08] discern it it doesn't matter how clear
[1:27:11] it is or how this it's went so so that
[1:27:15] that that's a part of it where it's got
[1:27:17] to be judged that's God's protection
[1:27:19] don't you thank God for his protection I
[1:27:22] thank God for his protection that he
[1:27:23] gives us as a body his word never comes
[1:27:26] to take anything away from us it's
[1:27:28] protection for our
[1:27:30] lives can't you see friends why it
[1:27:33] behooves us you see this is why and even
[1:27:35] for these things in this manner you
[1:27:37] can't you see why it behooves us that
[1:27:38] the love of God has to be preent in our
[1:27:40] life can you imagine what if what if the
[1:27:43] gift of discernments in your life and
[1:27:44] somebody raises and speaks in tongues
[1:27:46] and prophecy comes out but you've got
[1:27:48] something against that
[1:27:51] person can you see this listen is not
[1:27:54] even about what if there even is no if
[1:27:56] there's not even any of the nine
[1:27:58] spiritual gifts we don't want anything
[1:27:59] in our heart because the Rapture is
[1:28:01] greater than anything when we stand
[1:28:04] there on that day we're not going to be
[1:28:06] thinking about differences right that's
[1:28:08] true that's why it's
[1:28:10] important this was just a little side
[1:28:13] note but just like when the time zone
[1:28:14] I've worked with the song leaders and
[1:28:17] musicians and and others I said look
[1:28:20] every time when you come and you're here
[1:28:22] make sure your spirit is clean
[1:28:25] I've Got Confidence in your walk with
[1:28:28] God but you make sure your spirit is
[1:28:30] clean don't don't bring anything within
[1:28:32] your spirit let it be cleaned out let
[1:28:34] things be settled out let everything be
[1:28:36] settled out because why if not that can
[1:28:38] taint it can twist things that's in my
[1:28:42] life as a pastor as a
[1:28:44] minister but I don't believe it's just
[1:28:46] for me I believe it's for all of us I
[1:28:48] say God let us not live below our
[1:28:50] privileges let Lord let me go deeper in
[1:28:52] the love of God that it'll dis places
[1:28:54] those things it isn't me trying to tear
[1:28:56] them out of my life it's more of the
[1:28:59] love of God displaces
[1:29:02] it the secrets those things which are
[1:29:05] hidden in the life that are brought to
[1:29:07] light and this is why when Paul would
[1:29:11] say it in this
[1:29:13] way and Paul would write If any man
[1:29:16] speak in an unknown tongue Let It Be by
[1:29:18] two or three at the most and that by
[1:29:21] course and let one interpret so Paul is
[1:29:24] letting it be known right here that even
[1:29:26] if
[1:29:27] it's I think I said this the a couple
[1:29:30] weeks before maybe it's a fourth one or
[1:29:32] fifth one no no two or three Let It Be
[1:29:36] by
[1:29:37] course by course meaning if it's tongue
[1:29:40] and Paul's dealing dealing with tongues
[1:29:42] and interpretation here it comes here's
[1:29:44] the interpretation here's the tongues
[1:29:47] interpretation tongues interpretation
[1:29:49] and that's it
[1:29:55] that's the word isn't
[1:29:56] it but if there be no
[1:29:59] interpreter let them keep silent in the
[1:30:01] church and let him speak to himself and
[1:30:03] to God and let the prophet speak two or
[1:30:05] three and let the other judge this is
[1:30:07] the thing let the other judge and if
[1:30:10] anything be revealed to another that
[1:30:12] Seth by let the first hold his peace for
[1:30:16] ye may all prophesy one by one that all
[1:30:18] may learn and all may be
[1:30:22] comforted and the spirit of the prophets
[1:30:24] are subject to the prophets
[1:30:30] sorry now notice Paul would write this
[1:30:32] here and I've always when I Ponder this
[1:30:34] and look at this here Paul would say
[1:30:37] Brethren covet to prophesy in other
[1:30:39] words desire not not as though that
[1:30:42] chasing after but why because prophecy
[1:30:45] is what edifies the
[1:30:48] church it it it it either goes down and
[1:30:51] and makes known what is what's hinder
[1:30:55] ing or it can comfort and I want to just
[1:30:58] say this to you I've seen this I've
[1:31:02] witnessed it in our
[1:31:05] assembly at times spot on the
[1:31:09] money this building that we're in right
[1:31:12] now on this
[1:31:13] property some of you don't remember you
[1:31:15] weren't attending here at the time but
[1:31:17] on a Wednesday
[1:31:18] service and there
[1:31:20] was there was times of things that there
[1:31:23] there was a little bit of
[1:31:25] contention about oh I don't think we can
[1:31:28] do this I don't think we can not not
[1:31:30] among all but just things that was just
[1:31:31] kind of not not among the majority of
[1:31:33] the congregation but there were just
[1:31:35] some things and the spirit of God at the
[1:31:38] end of the service moved down there and
[1:31:42] spoke right out called my dad by name
[1:31:46] and laid everything out just has it
[1:31:48] would be that we would come into this
[1:31:50] property how many of you remember that
[1:31:52] we're there
[1:31:54] not many many people I do it was a
[1:31:56] Wednesday night you remember it it was a
[1:31:58] Wednesday night never forget it in my
[1:32:00] life it was spot right on the money it
[1:32:03] happened exactly because us standing
[1:32:06] here in this property it was a
[1:32:08] miracle you know this is why that you
[1:32:11] know businessmen go to a certain place
[1:32:13] and we come to a certain extent but when
[1:32:15] we're dealing with things of God and
[1:32:17] sometimes there's things I'm not talking
[1:32:19] about making bad decisions but I'm
[1:32:21] talking about when God gives a vision we
[1:32:23] follow the
[1:32:25] vision oh God was so I'm so glad for
[1:32:28] that aren't you notice this brother BR
[1:32:31] no he's going into this and I want to
[1:32:33] just I'm not going to read every one of
[1:32:34] these quotes here but I want to go
[1:32:36] through one quote here tonight and then
[1:32:38] I'll just try to I'm just going to pull
[1:32:41] off brother Bram keeps on laying this in
[1:32:44] remember when I I told you about in the
[1:32:46] flow of the service brother Brown keeps
[1:32:49] speaking of how that he had at one point
[1:32:52] in time the church church was in order
[1:32:55] in the terms of where the gifted people
[1:32:58] were meeting in the
[1:33:00] pre-service so it wasn't something that
[1:33:02] brother bam never had he experienced it
[1:33:05] he saw he saw the benefit of that he saw
[1:33:08] that now notice as he's he's he's
[1:33:10] speaking of this he speaks of it clear
[1:33:12] back here in 56 he's going in other
[1:33:15] earlier parts of the message and he's
[1:33:17] talking about how that they would come
[1:33:18] in for their Ministry and they would sit
[1:33:20] in the church and be quiet and maybe
[1:33:23] there'd be message that would be
[1:33:25] received and two or three with the
[1:33:27] spirit of discernment would discern it
[1:33:29] to be right or would say no it's not of
[1:33:33] God but brother Bram picks this up in a
[1:33:35] second-handed robe and I've have
[1:33:37] included this here for you Brooklyn New
[1:33:39] York this wasn't the Tabernacle but he's
[1:33:42] speaking in Brooklyn New
[1:33:44] York and I say this because for for
[1:33:47] individuals that would just say Well
[1:33:49] church order and what brother R said
[1:33:51] about the gifts was only for brandom
[1:33:52] Tabernacle
[1:33:54] many of these quotes and throughout
[1:33:57] brother bram's preaching around the
[1:33:59] United
[1:34:00] States because he's the prophet of the
[1:34:04] hour set the set it in order brother BR
[1:34:07] goes on to talk about that which I said
[1:34:09] before there's a quite quite a vast
[1:34:11] difference between a gift of Prophecy
[1:34:14] and a prophet I I've covered that let me
[1:34:16] jump to the next part of that he says in
[1:34:18] our Tabernacle at home when I first in
[1:34:21] our Baptist Church when I received the
[1:34:23] bapt AP ISM of the spirit and was called
[1:34:25] into the ministry we tried to seek out
[1:34:27] God for the spiritual gifts we had all
[1:34:30] the people that come who were gifted
[1:34:33] people maybe an hour before the service
[1:34:35] ever started now you couldn't do that
[1:34:40] unless you had people that were gifted
[1:34:43] and that was sought out and made known
[1:34:46] now when brother brandom was talking
[1:34:47] about seeking them out he's not talking
[1:34:49] about taking questionnaires right you
[1:34:51] know what this is where
[1:34:54] for for us us even in our lives we don't
[1:34:57] have to make anything happen the prophet
[1:34:59] tells us they're right here in the body
[1:35:01] the only thing we have to say is is Lord
[1:35:03] I want to be
[1:35:05] available I want to be available Lord to
[1:35:08] how whatever you want to use me and I'll
[1:35:09] just say it in this way if there's one
[1:35:11] thing that Paul stressed that we should
[1:35:13] seek after more than anything that's
[1:35:16] more of the love of
[1:35:19] God because when we brother BR says when
[1:35:21] we've got perfect love then you'll have
[1:35:23] perect perfect
[1:35:25] gifts so notice brother Bram goes on and
[1:35:29] I want to just kind of read through this
[1:35:30] here he says and the gifts of the Spirit
[1:35:33] is one would speak in unknown tongues
[1:35:34] and another give interpretation it could
[1:35:37] not be just a quoting of scripture
[1:35:39] because God don't use vain
[1:35:42] repetition yay I the Lord am coming yay
[1:35:44] I the Lord I'm
[1:35:46] coming I know that right that's not a
[1:35:49] direct message to the church
[1:35:53] it's got to be
[1:35:56] direct you say what what kind of direct
[1:35:58] this you got an example the prophet over
[1:36:00] and over I've got multiple quotes just
[1:36:03] exactly he says as the angel of the Lord
[1:36:06] was here on the platform that
[1:36:09] direct like brother brandham when he put
[1:36:12] that out there over and over he said oh
[1:36:13] brother brandham oh brother R you're
[1:36:15] putting us on the spot and the prophet
[1:36:17] said ain't I on the spot every
[1:36:21] night See's he's dealing with the
[1:36:23] sincerity and the reverence of those
[1:36:27] gifts
[1:36:29] right now notice he goes on and he
[1:36:31] saying now he says it must be some
[1:36:33] direct message to the church and then if
[1:36:35] it was to the church before it could be
[1:36:38] received in the church they had to at
[1:36:41] least three spiritual gifts there that
[1:36:44] was to call them like judges to judge
[1:36:46] and then three people with the gift of
[1:36:48] discernment in the Bible it's
[1:36:51] called and one would raise up and say
[1:36:54] it's of the Lord another one raised up
[1:36:56] it's of the Lord now brother br's
[1:36:57] talking about when he had them they were
[1:36:59] gathering prior to service he had a
[1:37:01] there was a place a room that was
[1:37:03] reserved you'd have them in there and
[1:37:05] one would raise up that's of the Lord
[1:37:06] what was said that's of God another one
[1:37:08] raises up it's of the Lord so two out of
[1:37:11] three declares it's of the lord it's
[1:37:14] wrote down it's put here on the
[1:37:18] pulpit watch he says so then the
[1:37:21] messages was taken down and then placed
[1:37:23] placed on my desk it couldn't be now
[1:37:26] like Jesus is coming soon we know that
[1:37:29] we know that it would be something like
[1:37:31] this watch's this
[1:37:33] example tell thus sayith the Lord tell
[1:37:36] brother Jones to get away from that
[1:37:38] place where he lives for it's near a
[1:37:40] railroad track for tomorrow at 2:00
[1:37:43] there's going to be a wreck there and
[1:37:44] his house will be destroyed that's a
[1:37:47] direct
[1:37:48] message but before brother Jones can
[1:37:51] receive it
[1:37:53] it's got to be
[1:37:57] judged oh brother
[1:38:00] Samuel this is just killing
[1:38:03] everything I say it like this if there's
[1:38:05] anything the word kills then it needs to
[1:38:08] be killed buried and forgotten
[1:38:12] about God never came to kill the message
[1:38:15] never came to kill the gifts it came to
[1:38:17] put him in order because we're not
[1:38:19] rallying around
[1:38:21] gifts we're rallying around the gift of
[1:38:25] the Holy Ghost the person of Jesus
[1:38:31] Christ or tell brother brandham that
[1:38:34] tonight there'll be some someone come in
[1:38:36] here from a certain place that's got a
[1:38:37] certain disease be dressed in a certain
[1:38:39] way and he shall go to them they'll be
[1:38:41] brought in tonight by ambulance and tell
[1:38:43] them that this thing that's against them
[1:38:46] thus sayith the
[1:38:48] Lord if those messages were taken down
[1:38:50] the witnesses witness that it was the
[1:38:52] Holy Spirit it was then laid on the
[1:38:54] pulpit and then the church began gather
[1:38:57] and all the gifts would have done their
[1:38:59] part in the meeting there was nothing
[1:39:02] taking place then but the singing of
[1:39:03] hymn so now brother Bram is laying this
[1:39:05] in that went from the
[1:39:07] pre-service now into the song
[1:39:10] service brother Bram says and when I
[1:39:12] came out to speak which when I was in
[1:39:14] the room they'd press a button a red
[1:39:16] light would come
[1:39:17] on I'd been in there maybe all afternoon
[1:39:20] praying and walking with the message of
[1:39:21] the Lord on my heart and before I made
[1:39:23] the message or preached from the
[1:39:25] platform on the pull pit these these
[1:39:28] messages I read them off then went on
[1:39:30] with the message and then after the
[1:39:32] message the altar call if these things
[1:39:35] that were written on there came to pass
[1:39:37] we thank the Lord and praised him for it
[1:39:40] if it didn't come to pass they had a
[1:39:42] cleaning up time there was an evil
[1:39:44] spirit among them cuz God don't tell
[1:39:50] lies brother BR says and that's the way
[1:39:52] the gift should be
[1:39:54] operated and then all this stuff that
[1:39:57] goes on in the name of the gifts would
[1:39:58] be called
[1:40:00] out and no one wants an evil spirit on
[1:40:03] there to lie and to do those things they
[1:40:05] want the real there's a real Spirit you
[1:40:07] don't have to have that kind of a spirit
[1:40:08] God's got a real spirit for you so you
[1:40:11] don't want them things that the devil
[1:40:12] would give and that's the way the gifts
[1:40:16] should be operated I don't know why I
[1:40:18] got double slides in there and if that
[1:40:20] was wrong then all those people repented
[1:40:22] and prayed and
[1:40:24] did I say that one
[1:40:25] already they prayed and fasted and went
[1:40:28] before the Lord till that Spirit got off
[1:40:30] of them and all of them and the
[1:40:31] witnesses and the ones who discerned it
[1:40:33] so not only the person who who the
[1:40:36] interpretation but everyone that
[1:40:38] discerned it all of them it's an evil
[1:40:43] spirit this is why you know when you we
[1:40:46] this is why the the carefulness within
[1:40:48] things let me just say this to you you
[1:40:50] think evil spirits won't try to give me
[1:40:52] inspiration
[1:40:55] that's why everything when I when I
[1:40:57] receive something let me just tell you
[1:40:58] something it isn't something you say oh
[1:41:00] oh I felt that inspiration that was of
[1:41:02] the
[1:41:04] devil you can try to psych people out
[1:41:06] but that ain't the truth you have to
[1:41:09] take it all back to the word I want to
[1:41:12] see it from Genesis to Revelation when I
[1:41:14] can see it all the way through but if
[1:41:17] there's one hang up on that
[1:41:19] inspiration that didn't come from God
[1:41:22] right and I can say thank you Lord get
[1:41:25] that out of here you say oh how could
[1:41:28] that be well let's look at the prophet
[1:41:29] of God how many times the angel of the
[1:41:31] Lord visited him he had more visitations
[1:41:34] than what anybody's had but yet here he
[1:41:37] is over in Cairo Egypt and he's getting
[1:41:40] ready to go to Israel and the spirit of
[1:41:42] the Lord is speaking to him but he don't
[1:41:44] know it's the spirit of the Lord he's
[1:41:46] asking Lord is that you telling me not
[1:41:48] to go right is that right he asked him
[1:41:51] three times that he stepped over in the
[1:41:53] hanger yeah not the coat hanger you know
[1:41:56] where the airplanes come out he stepped
[1:41:58] over there took his hat off and he says
[1:41:59] Lord is that you talking to me you see
[1:42:02] this is why I I love I love that
[1:42:04] transparency it just goes to show us we
[1:42:06] don't base anything on a feeling it
[1:42:08] might feel exactly like when the spirit
[1:42:10] of God has spoke to us but judge even in
[1:42:13] your own life judge everything not by
[1:42:16] how it feels you judge it by the word
[1:42:20] amen and if you're not sure wait until
[1:42:24] you're
[1:42:25] sure because God's not going to fault
[1:42:28] you for wanting to be
[1:42:34] sure is that all
[1:42:36] right brother BR says they were if it
[1:42:38] wasn't they were all wrong and we had to
[1:42:40] get the thing cleaned up that's the way
[1:42:41] the gifts should be operated in the
[1:42:43] church to my opinion now I know people
[1:42:46] might say well that's his opinion I'll
[1:42:48] take his
[1:42:49] opinion we got a Vindicated Prophet I'll
[1:42:52] take his opinion
[1:42:54] that's the way it worked wonderful in
[1:42:56] our Tabernacle at home watch this if
[1:42:59] that would work in a Baptist Church it
[1:43:01] surely ought to work in a Pentecostal
[1:43:03] Church certainly ought to it's just the
[1:43:06] sincerity you must respect those gifts
[1:43:09] and give them a place and everything
[1:43:10] where they should be brother BR said
[1:43:13] it's the Bible the Bible's the blueprint
[1:43:14] just how it should be put together how
[1:43:16] they should operate then you'll have no
[1:43:18] trouble at all nowhere everything will
[1:43:20] move just exactly in the will of the
[1:43:22] Lord look at that statement if he wants
[1:43:25] anything
[1:43:27] said he will speak it and give the
[1:43:30] interpretation of it and set it out and
[1:43:32] it'll happen just exactly to the minute
[1:43:34] the way God said it
[1:43:36] would God wants to use the scissors
[1:43:38] he'll do
[1:43:39] it if he wants to use the stap for
[1:43:42] tonight he'll do it if he don't need to
[1:43:44] use any of them tonight he don't have to
[1:43:46] use any of them
[1:43:48] tonight is that right
[1:43:52] true brother Bram says it like this I
[1:43:54] let me just have just a few more moments
[1:43:56] here I want to just tie I want to bring
[1:43:57] this down to a certain point and then
[1:44:00] and then I'm off brother BR he goes on
[1:44:02] once again here in Southern Pines North
[1:44:04] Carolina on that same thing that I've
[1:44:06] just went through and read to you but at
[1:44:08] the end of this quote he says put your
[1:44:09] church in that kind of order and watch
[1:44:13] what Pentecost Rises to that's the way
[1:44:16] Paul had it done that's the way it's
[1:44:18] done in the
[1:44:19] scripture and he goes on of how things
[1:44:21] you know are not just people just
[1:44:23] standing up just in the middle because
[1:44:24] brother Bram seen that people standing
[1:44:25] up in the middle of preaching and
[1:44:27] everything else and it was actually
[1:44:29] that's what was taking place even there
[1:44:32] at home in the Tabernacle and brother
[1:44:35] Bram goes on in in different places
[1:44:37] there within the
[1:44:39] scripture uh within the message but I
[1:44:42] want to just this word here and I let me
[1:44:45] just wrap this up tonight brother Bram
[1:44:46] uses this
[1:44:47] term accumulating he's he's he's
[1:44:51] speaking in in Daniel 70 weeks and I'll
[1:44:53] read it to you Lord willing next week he
[1:44:55] said we're beginning to see the gifts
[1:44:58] accumulating Among Us he said and we see
[1:45:02] them to where that things are actually
[1:45:06] they're being wrote down and it's coming
[1:45:09] to pass and so brother brandham is
[1:45:11] getting he's longing that it can
[1:45:14] actually come back to a place to where
[1:45:16] they can be able to meet before service
[1:45:20] cuz he's he's admonishing them all the
[1:45:22] way through all all the way through 64
[1:45:24] this is your part in the body it's a
[1:45:28] needed
[1:45:29] Ministry but you see this is what I want
[1:45:32] to say in the
[1:45:34] meantime the order still applies in that
[1:45:39] if one speaks in tongues pray that he
[1:45:42] may prophesy or interpret right if
[1:45:44] there's no interpreter which would be
[1:45:46] prophecy then don't speak at all but if
[1:45:48] it's prophecy it's got to be a direct
[1:45:50] message and it comes in its rightful
[1:45:54] time so it' be just like what we would
[1:45:57] have right here we're we're not in the
[1:45:59] place right now to have have get a side
[1:46:02] you know and designate a
[1:46:05] room perhaps God will bring that about
[1:46:09] before the the Rapture that's a
[1:46:11] Target but right now just like when
[1:46:14] brother bram's talking about the
[1:46:15] Tabernacle there's got to be an
[1:46:17] accumulating of gifts because if you
[1:46:19] have someone speaking in tongues you
[1:46:20] also have to have someone interpret
[1:46:22] right and if you have that you also have
[1:46:24] to have that which is able Gifts of
[1:46:27] discernment so that has to has to work
[1:46:30] together but in the meantime they're
[1:46:32] still here in the body and it isn't that
[1:46:34] God is you know God's put out but at the
[1:46:37] same time we don't want to be racing or
[1:46:39] trying to chase after gifts I'll tell
[1:46:41] you this if we just fall more in love
[1:46:43] with him
[1:46:45] then if if he wants to use us for
[1:46:47] something he'll make that known to us
[1:46:50] let let let him bring these things
[1:46:52] around let him bringing around in his
[1:46:54] own time just like in a service in its
[1:46:57] rightful time because let me tell you
[1:46:59] it's necessary these are necessary Parts
[1:47:02] because we God would never put them in
[1:47:04] the body if they are not needed in some
[1:47:13] way look how brother Bram he says this
[1:47:15] concerning his sister let me read this
[1:47:18] one to you is this all right I told you
[1:47:20] I I I really mean it I'm going to read
[1:47:21] this quote and I'm done
[1:47:23] let me just let me just show you this
[1:47:24] what brother bram's dealing with right
[1:47:26] here and showing you that right now
[1:47:28] where it's at it would it would take
[1:47:31] place after the ministering of the word
[1:47:34] after the word has been ministering the
[1:47:36] spirit of the prophets is subject unto
[1:47:39] the prophets watch how brother Ram says
[1:47:40] this he's just come out to the platform
[1:47:42] and and he says now he says now that at
[1:47:45] first he was just getting ready to speak
[1:47:47] to the people and this sister broke into
[1:47:48] speaking in tongues he said did you
[1:47:50] notice the interpretation didn't come to
[1:47:53] the word our sister was anointed with
[1:47:55] the Holy Spirit no doubt watch brother
[1:47:58] BR didn't un christianize her right she
[1:48:00] in the brandom time this she was out of
[1:48:02] order but he didn't UNC christianize her
[1:48:04] watch how he does this our sister was
[1:48:06] anointed with the with the spirit no
[1:48:08] doubt but she had given the message
[1:48:10] after the word had come in brother bam
[1:48:12] had just come to the pl the platform he
[1:48:13] was just praying and getting ready to
[1:48:15] come in it's just a little bit from the
[1:48:18] order of the thing now that was all
[1:48:19] right sister dear ever who you are watch
[1:48:22] out brother br brother BR is a gentleman
[1:48:25] because you know why the holy spirit's a
[1:48:27] gentleman he he just he just let it be
[1:48:29] known right there I thank God for this
[1:48:31] example he says now he said that's a
[1:48:33] holy spirit upon you he says it's hard
[1:48:35] to hold it like that I know or when
[1:48:38] you're be saying something and it's all
[1:48:40] right but you probably felt it even
[1:48:43] before that we started you know before
[1:48:45] we started to preach but that's the
[1:48:46] reason it comes back when the spirit's
[1:48:49] working the spirits of the prophesied
[1:48:52] the prophets you see that's you maybe
[1:48:55] the Holy Spirit anoints you again I hope
[1:48:58] he does just after the service is over
[1:49:02] talking about after the ministering of
[1:49:04] the word the prophet said I hope he
[1:49:06] anoints you again you watch the
[1:49:09] interpretation come because it could
[1:49:11] could be straight in order then but
[1:49:13] we're just approaching the word here now
[1:49:15] that was really God it really was I
[1:49:17] believe it and I feel it with all my
[1:49:19] heart because I felt the back come to it
[1:49:21] you see
[1:49:23] but it wasn't time and it's got a
[1:49:25] message to the sister for the church but
[1:49:28] here's where he's working his
[1:49:30] message now you see he won't confuse
[1:49:36] himself he puts all things in order
[1:49:41] don't you love him so there's a Target
[1:49:44] there's some things that I want to God
[1:49:46] will help us You' like to stand I want
[1:49:50] to just wanted to continue to work with
[1:49:53] that just a little bit as the Lord and
[1:49:55] just pressing on my heart
[1:49:57] and just dealing with
[1:50:00] this on the order of spiritual gifts
[1:50:04] because I tell you
[1:50:06] friends whatever God put in the
[1:50:09] church it's still in the church God
[1:50:12] never intended for it to be taken
[1:50:15] away I know I know you know
[1:50:19] I've I've heard it said where when you
[1:50:22] get sometimes to things like this and
[1:50:24] you start really things start having to
[1:50:26] be you know put in order in a way and
[1:50:28] you go into that then it's you know
[1:50:31] sometimes you'll have things where
[1:50:32] people say oh you're you're just trying
[1:50:34] to stifle the move of
[1:50:38] God anybody any real son or daughter of
[1:50:42] God don't want to stifle the move of
[1:50:44] God but there God has an order he has a
[1:50:48] timing he has a place and we want
[1:50:53] we want we want whatever is needed we
[1:50:56] want we want God to work in his own way
[1:50:59] in his own time and like i' I've said to
[1:51:02] you right here my wife and I were we
[1:51:04] were just it was I think it was last
[1:51:06] night I I think it was last night or
[1:51:08] maybe the night night before we were
[1:51:10] sitting there in a living room and she
[1:51:12] had had on a message and after we got
[1:51:14] out out of dinner and and I was sitting
[1:51:17] there and I was just studying and she
[1:51:18] was she had on this she had on the
[1:51:20] message he cares do you care and and I'm
[1:51:22] just just continuing looking over um the
[1:51:25] quotes and things you know after supper
[1:51:27] i' left here and I just I wanted to
[1:51:28] continue to look over things and all of
[1:51:31] a sudden I said I looked at her I said
[1:51:34] did you hear what the prophet just said
[1:51:35] on there you know it just seemed like it
[1:51:37] caught me and what it was there was a
[1:51:40] sister who had come up to be prayed for
[1:51:45] but she had a burden for somebody else
[1:51:48] in the
[1:51:50] congregation and the prophet said did
[1:51:52] you see that how that went when she went
[1:51:55] back and laid her hands on that other
[1:51:58] sister she went by there I stopped at I
[1:52:01] told my wife I said you see what that
[1:52:03] was I said that was one of the gifts
[1:52:06] working in the
[1:52:08] body right there God moving and placing
[1:52:12] that in somebody's heart in here they
[1:52:14] went by they had a burden somebody else
[1:52:16] had a need and it was so moved upon
[1:52:18] their hearts you see the things that
[1:52:20] we're covering we're looking at here
[1:52:22] here with tongues and interpretation
[1:52:24] look this is one of the things that Paul
[1:52:26] dealt with the most within the book of
[1:52:29] Corinthians I don't know but I would say
[1:52:32] that probably that they would look at
[1:52:34] tongues and Ma you see the supernatural
[1:52:36] it would be a very Supernatural
[1:52:38] occurrence but I want to just say to you
[1:52:40] every one of those gifts are
[1:52:43] Supernatural and tongues itself is the
[1:52:46] least wisdom is what
[1:52:50] is the top because because without
[1:52:52] wisdom we don't know how to operate
[1:52:54] anything wisdom knowledge on down but
[1:52:57] don't you thank God for his mercy God
[1:53:00] knows what we have need of he knows how
[1:53:02] to speak to our hearts I I thank God for
[1:53:06] for his Mercy let's just bow our heads
[1:53:08] on a word of
[1:53:09] prayer Heavenly
[1:53:11] Father
[1:53:14] Lord I so thank you Lord for your
[1:53:18] mercy I thank you Father for your
[1:53:21] leadership and your gu guidance Lord in
[1:53:23] our lives in this
[1:53:25] hour thank you Father for the
[1:53:28] [Music]
[1:53:29] clarity Lord Jesus sometimes Lord were
[1:53:33] these things that
[1:53:35] we we revisit Lord as you would lead
[1:53:39] us I find the propit Lord throughout the
[1:53:42] number of
[1:53:44] years within the
[1:53:46] message not just
[1:53:49] throughout the country and different
[1:53:52] places as he would
[1:53:53] speak but even right there Lord at his
[1:53:56] home
[1:53:58] Church things would be Revisited Lord
[1:54:02] even to where it would come down to a a
[1:54:06] time to where when the word
[1:54:09] would after the gifts had been
[1:54:12] accumulated you come down to a real
[1:54:14] testing
[1:54:16] time whether they would
[1:54:19] heed to the correction and Leadership of
[1:54:22] the world
[1:54:23] word or they would just go their own
[1:54:27] way Lord
[1:54:30] Jesus I feel like Lord that the prophet
[1:54:34] said he said anything I need to be
[1:54:37] corrected in I want to be
[1:54:40] corrected he said the Holy Spirit within
[1:54:43] my life that puts me in that place I
[1:54:46] want to be when I'm wrong I want to be
[1:54:49] right I want to be corrected Lord
[1:54:53] I thank you Father
[1:54:54] for speaking to our hearts taking us I
[1:54:57] want to say Lord I Thank you for even
[1:55:00] just within this
[1:55:02] time just as you've been leading me Lord
[1:55:05] and combing back through certain things
[1:55:07] even things that I've put before you
[1:55:09] Lord you know in prayer and I've asked
[1:55:11] you Lord I need
[1:55:15] understanding
[1:55:16] father you've not failed
[1:55:20] Lord in your time
[1:55:22] in your time
[1:55:24] Lord You've spoken you've given us the
[1:55:27] leadership that we
[1:55:29] need Lord Jesus help us I
[1:55:33] pray if there's one thing Lord that we
[1:55:35] want if there's one thing Lord that we
[1:55:39] could set our sights
[1:55:42] on as a body of Believers those that are
[1:55:45] gathered here those on the internet Lord
[1:55:48] that are streaming those Lord that would
[1:55:51] tune into to this service if there's one
[1:55:53] thing that we can set our sights
[1:55:56] on May It Be the love of
[1:56:01] God because Lord without Divine
[1:56:05] love these gifts have no
[1:56:09] value there's no it's divine love that
[1:56:12] gives value to the gift no matter how
[1:56:15] that a man could
[1:56:17] preach that's not what a value is it's
[1:56:20] not a value how he could put together
[1:56:22] scriptures and quotes that's not the
[1:56:24] value the value is the love of
[1:56:29] God this is why Lord even when it comes
[1:56:31] to a home as a husband
[1:56:35] wife how that Lord here within the
[1:56:38] church it's to be governed by
[1:56:42] love Lord we're not seeking for
[1:56:46] gifts we're seeking for more of
[1:56:49] you and Lord just like those little
[1:56:52] little utensils I brought out of my
[1:56:54] office I use them from time to
[1:56:57] time sometimes Lord I've went my office
[1:57:00] I had no idea that I was going to use
[1:57:04] that particular
[1:57:06] utensil I went in there today Lord there
[1:57:09] something I had to print
[1:57:11] out and then I wanted to staple it and
[1:57:14] put it in a file I had no idea did not
[1:57:17] even go into my office in there and
[1:57:19] print that out with a mind I'm going to
[1:57:22] staple
[1:57:24] this Lord neither neither do you want us
[1:57:29] that we would be focused on
[1:57:31] anything but you

[1:57:50] more Lord I'm not interested in being a
[1:57:52] better preacher I'm interested Lord I
[1:57:54] want more of the love of God to have
[1:57:57] more longsuffering more
[1:58:00] patience I want more of the holy spirit
[1:58:03] that I could be more of a servant Lord
[1:58:05] to your
[1:58:07] people I want more of the love of
[1:58:11] God lord being able to look at
[1:58:16] differences and have Lord such a a love
[1:58:19] for one another oh God help us
[1:58:23] help us Lord help us through our
[1:58:25] families through this church Lord God

[1:58:34] word from the other
