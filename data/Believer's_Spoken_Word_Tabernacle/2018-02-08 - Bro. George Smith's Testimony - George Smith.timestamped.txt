[43:52] we're just thankful to be here we had to
[43:55] reschedule once we're not gonna let the
[43:57] devil get us down again but if you have
[44:00] your Bibles let's open our stand and
[44:03] open our scriptures to Acts chapter one
[44:08] and appreciate the music you got some
[44:12] real good musicians here family
[44:21] straightened out here in a minute
[44:22] Acts chapter one and verse six this is
[44:26] after the resurrection
[44:27] it says when their their former come
[44:29] together so they didn't stay home did
[44:31] they they got together
[44:33] get that straight they came together and
[44:38] they asked of him saying Lord well at
[44:41] this time well you know at this time
[44:43] restore again the Kingdom of Israel
[44:45] now here's people that's been walking
[44:47] with him and this is the biggest
[44:51] question they could come up with it's
[44:54] just like us they had wives and
[44:56] mother-in-law all in and stuff and they
[44:58] they had this political question
[45:00] unbelievable and he said it is not for
[45:03] you to know the times or the seasons
[45:05] which the father had put in his own
[45:08] power but you shall receive power after
[45:11] that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and
[45:13] you shall be witnesses unto me both here
[45:16] in Jerusalem over there in Judea over in
[45:18] Samaria and unto the uttermost part of
[45:20] the earth all the way to Ohio it didn't
[45:25] come in a parachute
[45:26] somebody had to come over here and bring
[45:29] the gospel amen and it's still going on
[45:33] tonight
[45:34] let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you
[45:36] for your grace to us tonight we thank
[45:38] you that we can be surrounded by people
[45:40] that our blood washed people that enjoy
[45:43] the presence of the Lord the good music
[45:45] and Lord we just pray that you would
[45:47] come amongst us now make yourself real
[45:49] to your people Lord as we go down the
[45:51] memory lane one more time to relate the
[45:53] history the things that have come our
[45:57] way we pray that it be a blessing to
[45:58] someone the Lord that we could have
[46:01] fellowship around your word and the Lord
[46:03] that we could go from here and say it
[46:05] was good to be in the house of Lord be
[46:07] with each one you're the one that can
[46:09] bless you're the one that can reward the
[46:10] sacrifice help us in Jesus name Amen
[46:13] you may be seated so I'm not an
[46:20] entertainer although it's okay to laugh
[46:22] in church okay we're not legalists we're
[46:25] not you know those other kind of people
[46:27] but I'm just trying to be a faithful
[46:29] witness of a mighty message that we have
[46:31] and from this scripture that we read it
[46:35] does the same thing about an attorney
[46:36] Jesus Christ is our attorney and he's
[46:41] the only righteous one and it doesn't
[46:43] say anything about a judge we're not to
[46:46] be
[46:47] you know we're not judging things we are
[46:49] fruit inspectors we see things that
[46:52] aren't right we just you know try to
[46:53] help it we don't have all the answers
[46:55] the pastor didn't have all the answers
[46:57] and so we a a lot of times you know when
[47:03] we're at especially in the summertime
[47:05] when the windows are open we're at the
[47:06] house and we hear the neighbor talking
[47:08] on the phone and so we only hear half
[47:12] the conversation right but we are the
[47:18] wise and prudent people of the 21st
[47:21] century so we we make up the rest of it
[47:25] and then we pass judgment and then we
[47:28] get ourselves in a lot of trouble so
[47:30] we're not attorneys we're not judges
[47:33] we're only witnesses and to be a witness
[47:35] you had to be there now what somebody
[47:38] told you about but you have to have the
[47:39] experience yourself so we trust that you
[47:42] can learn something from what we're
[47:45] gonna speak here tonight just gonna kind
[47:47] of get together get acquainted you know
[47:50] that you can fill in the blanks and take
[47:53] away the cobwebs of some of the things
[47:55] you've heard or what you don't
[47:57] understand about the testimony but I'm
[48:02] the eagle that was born in the Baptist
[48:04] chicken yard
[48:05] I wasn't born in the Eagle Nest like
[48:09] some of you I wasn't born in the
[48:11] Catholic nest how many was Baptist be
[48:15] honest a few honest people but we trust
[48:26] that you'll learn something that we can
[48:28] you know be the overcomers that the word
[48:30] says we are now we're not going to be
[48:32] here all night we'll be out before
[48:34] before 10:30
[48:35] promise because we're gonna come back
[48:38] tomorrow night right
[48:39] Lord will oh yeah so don't try to say it
[48:41] all tonight but my parents were both
[48:46] Americans got to set that straight
[48:49] especially for the Latinos here and the
[48:51] people in South Carolina that said well
[48:53] it's okay mixed marriage because man
[48:55] brother branham gave his daughter to
[48:56] Mexican no that's not the way it worked
[49:02] my father was from Kansas City Missouri
[49:04] and my mother was from Tucson Arizona
[49:06] but my grandfather came from England you
[49:09] know just like me okay so they met in
[49:14] Bible School over in California way back
[49:18] they were married in June of 1944 and
[49:22] immediately went to Mexico
[49:24] because there still is today
[49:27] tribes of people around the world they
[49:31] don't have any idea of Jesus Christ here
[49:34] we come to church you know three times a
[49:36] week we hear it on the radio TV every
[49:37] place but there's places that don't know
[49:39] the gospel yet and there's places that
[49:42] don't even have a written language so
[49:45] back then there was more they've made a
[49:46] lot of progress but they they joined up
[49:50] with the Wickliffe Bible Translators and
[49:52] went into Mexico to find this tribe up
[49:55] in the mountains of Chihuahua which is
[49:56] about 300 miles south of El Paso and
[49:59] they went up in there not knowing one
[50:01] word of Spanish much less that other
[50:03] language and they went as far as the
[50:07] truck would go then they got on these
[50:09] horses that they had hired and went for
[50:12] days up into the mountains now today
[50:14] there's roads go through there but this
[50:15] is almost hundred years ago and so they
[50:19] were up there trying to locate these
[50:23] people and first you have to establish a
[50:27] dictionary they have nothing written
[50:29] it's only verbal you know and so they
[50:32] would have to you know point to
[50:35] something how do you say this and try to
[50:37] sound it out and make up well that takes
[50:40] a long time I'm an eyewitness that my
[50:43] father wasn't that patient and take my
[50:46] word for
[50:48] but he was up there for probably three
[50:51] years and so as happens in new homes the
[50:55] baby's going to be born well they came
[50:57] back on the horses came back out of the
[50:59] mountains instead of going up into the
[51:01] United States they went to the
[51:02] headquarters of that outfit down in
[51:04] Mexico City and that's where their first
[51:06] child was born in late August 1945 that
[51:11] was me so we got that straight
[51:16] eventually I was the first of ten
[51:18] children yeah and so there was five boys
[51:24] and five girls God knows what he's doing
[51:28] you can hear on tape or the brim says
[51:30] God provides for what he sends well by
[51:35] 1952 my father had moved to the east
[51:39] coast of Mexico over by the Gulf of
[51:41] Mexico and that's where I started the
[51:44] elementary school because that's where
[51:47] we lived and so here I was in the school
[51:50] with Mexicans and and I was the only guy
[51:53] that spoke English course I spoke
[51:54] Spanish by then to some you know raised
[51:56] right with him and this was all God's
[51:58] plan of getting a foundation in two
[52:02] languages and my mother not knowing why
[52:04] but she she had a rule at the house and
[52:07] that was in the house you speak English
[52:10] and out there he speaks Spanish now we
[52:13] did not know the word discrimination yet
[52:15] okay so relax it was simply to keep the
[52:19] languages separate all you people
[52:21] Frederico Lord help you but you have to
[52:28] keep the languages separate now
[52:30] I didn't know why back then but then
[52:33] later we'll get to the story why it was
[52:35] important so here I was the missionary
[52:39] son you know with my brother and sisters
[52:41] at the time and and every service every
[52:44] three times a week at least we're in
[52:45] churches right on the front bench and
[52:47] eventually when I was about nine years
[52:49] old I realized that the gospel it wasn't
[52:52] just for all these people was for me too
[52:54] you know because the scripture says that
[52:56] all have sinned
[52:58] all the Smiths children all the brownie
[53:01] children all the brand until drew
[53:03] they've all sinned and in short of the
[53:07] glory God's glory God's over there we
[53:09] can't get there without Jesus Christ so
[53:12] that was my first revelation and so I
[53:16] received the Lord Jesus the Savior and I
[53:18] was baptized in the Baptist Church on
[53:20] Easter Sunday of 1955 now you already
[53:24] know how old I am amazing I still
[53:26] remember all this right now but the
[53:29] Lord's been good to us well we were like
[53:34] say it was in elementary school all
[53:36] Spanish my mother was teaching us at
[53:38] home a little bit of home school but
[53:40] when I got out of the sixth grade my
[53:44] parents made an executive decision
[53:45] without consulting me and they sent me
[53:48] to Texas to live with the family of
[53:50] Baptists and seventh grade on you know
[53:53] well that was interesting
[53:56] so we lived in several places and
[53:59] finally in January of 62 I ended up with
[54:05] my grandfather in Tucson Arizona and so
[54:08] we were in school there and I was like
[54:12] halfway through the 10th grade I think
[54:13] but no when I went there and so this was
[54:16] a big school there's like 2,500 kids and
[54:18] and this is way back you know 60 to 63
[54:22] when the girls were skirts no shorts at
[54:26] school there was respect it's a
[54:28] different world today you all know that
[54:30] now back then it wasn't though there
[54:33] wasn't the choice issue so we have home
[54:34] school though there's no whole school
[54:35] there wasn't part of the plan
[54:37] there was Christian school the Baptist
[54:40] Church had a Christian school eventually
[54:41] but the the thing was that my dad had
[54:46] this idea first of all he he said we
[54:50] have a democracy here I have the vote no
[54:54] simple now somehow he raised ten
[54:56] children with no rock-and-roll no
[54:58] premarital sex no drugs so he had
[55:01] something going you know
[55:03] and so uh we he had this idea of the the
[55:08] Christian school which so those were his
[55:09] friends that operated the Christian
[55:11] school but he said you know what I see
[55:14] is that when when kids go to the public
[55:16] school they're gonna hear things they
[55:19] shouldn't hear they're gonna get their
[55:21] lunch stolen their things are gonna
[55:22] happen and you you kind of you know gear
[55:25] yourself for it but you go to the
[55:28] Christian school some of the same things
[55:30] happen but you don't expect it there so
[55:33] the solution is family prayer and then
[55:36] no matter where the kids go they're
[55:37] gonna be okay and no television okay so
[55:44] being in high school I had a lot of
[55:47] friends and at the time I was the what
[55:51] do you call it the assistant choir
[55:52] director at the at the Baptist Church
[55:54] and I was in school it's amazing news
[55:56] Akande so forth so all of a sudden in
[56:00] January of 63 I started I saw this other
[56:03] girl at school you know somebody who was
[56:05] different and so I had a lot of friends
[56:08] and so this one girl that I knew she
[56:09] said now you're you're so picky
[56:12] you know you we noticed you don't hardly
[56:14] date anybody and when you do it's only
[56:16] one date and so but we know just the
[56:21] girl for you and so I said well where is
[56:24] she
[56:25] well she so they're getting on the bus
[56:26] and so the next day I'm at Rebecca
[56:29] Branham and sure enough most beautiful
[56:32] lady on the planet you know and so you
[56:34] know how it is you know how was you stop
[56:36] shopping right that's the one
[56:39] and so um and so I found out that her
[56:43] her own she had an older brother Paul
[56:46] this could be a problem
[56:47] but then when I met him he was a skinny
[56:49] kid like me it didn't matter and so she
[56:52] just when I met her then she said well
[56:54] we have to meet my dad okay
[56:56] well being the missionary's kid I had
[56:58] met a lot of preachers so I mean another
[57:00] preacher wasn't a big deal well the
[57:02] miracle is that God had moved these
[57:03] people from Indiana to Arizona 1800
[57:06] miles away and put him a block and a
[57:08] half from my house
[57:10] so that's more evidence of
[57:12] predestination I didn't have to go
[57:16] hunting it was right there so so I go up
[57:21] in meet Reverend Brenham and he was very
[57:25] nice he was in the backyard didn't have
[57:27] a shirt on he was working with the
[57:28] plants or something and and she
[57:30] disappeared she left us alone
[57:32] Wow and so um we we talked a little
[57:36] while and I don't know what he said I
[57:38] didn't record that didn't think he knows
[57:40] no pictures but when we finished talking
[57:44] I was there for a purpose and I wanted
[57:46] to date his daughter and here I was
[57:49] about 17 years old and so in the process
[57:53] of this few minutes talking he said well
[57:55] sure you know I had permission well at
[57:58] that point I had the victory but he had
[58:00] the problem because there were some
[58:02] other guys that were kind of waiting
[58:04] their opportunity and believe it or not
[58:06] one of them was our friend
[58:08] Mike Seaver he looked a lot different
[58:11] than 63 but anyway yeah I didn't find
[58:18] that out there bout five years ago and
[58:24] so and so what I what I found out a long
[58:28] time later in that short conversation he
[58:32] was deserted me what just discerning
[58:34] what he was looking at right he was er
[58:36] not passed the whole future and that's
[58:38] why he could confidently say yeah you
[58:40] can go out with her so since you guys
[58:42] aren't prophets then don't be trying
[58:44] that you will fail okay so let's move
[58:50] along here and so also I didn't have a
[58:54] fancy car I just had it I had a five
[58:56] year old Ford pickup they didn't have
[58:59] dual cab back then I didn't have
[59:01] electric windows didn't have a lot of
[59:03] things I don't think you had turn
[59:05] signals you know and and I thought and
[59:09] her brother had this brand-new red Chevy
[59:11] oh I look pretty bad but her dad had a
[59:14] Ford station wagon
[59:16] so even down
[59:18] and the fact is that when they first
[59:21] moved Arizona they lived in an apartment
[59:24] farther away but when I met them they
[59:26] lived like a block and a half from my
[59:27] house but when they moved from Arizona
[59:31] from Indiana to Arizona
[59:32] they had already lived in the same house
[59:34] since 1948 till 1962 and during that
[59:38] time of course life was you know has a
[59:40] certain rhythm and the church and the
[59:43] family and friends and so forth and the
[59:46] piano teacher was across the street so
[59:48] every time when everybody went in
[59:51] Rebecca would come home from school she
[59:53] would practice her piano it was just a
[59:55] short you know kind of like the organ is
[59:57] just a spinet piano it wasn't big piano
[1:00:00] so when they moved Arizona
[1:00:02] they moved by vision they didn't take a
[1:00:04] vote we think I would go no they he said
[1:00:07] we're going so they left they didn't
[1:00:08] know how long they're gonna be gone it's
[1:00:11] all they took was their clothes so they
[1:00:13] get to Arizona and there's no church
[1:00:15] there's no friends there's no trees
[1:00:19] there's no piano well it didn't take her
[1:00:22] very long to find out that the girl at
[1:00:24] the corner had a grand piano and her
[1:00:27] mother was a piano teacher so she would
[1:00:29] gravitate down there when she could and
[1:00:31] and so then that's the girl that
[1:00:35] actually introduced us anyway so one day
[1:00:38] brother branham is taking his family to
[1:00:40] supper and he's you know they got three
[1:00:42] children so he looks in the back seat
[1:00:43] his station wagon there's only two
[1:00:44] where's Rebecca
[1:00:45] well she's at the corner figure up down
[1:00:47] there so he stops at the corner to pick
[1:00:50] up Rebecca to go to supper and this is
[1:00:53] before I met him and so he he goes up to
[1:00:58] the door and he hears this music well
[1:01:02] yeah there was two girls on one piano
[1:01:04] and play it and so Rebecca comes down on
[1:01:08] the bass and the other girl was up at
[1:01:09] the top of the piano and so he knocks on
[1:01:12] the door real loud now this wasn't down
[1:01:14] at the cross and there wasn't any of
[1:01:16] those songs we just sang it was a movie
[1:01:18] theme you know and so he knocks on the
[1:01:23] door and so eventually she comes to the
[1:01:25] door and now he didn't sure his belt off
[1:01:28] why when they get you
[1:01:29] no he was a balanced individual he knew
[1:01:32] how to treat people
[1:01:34] okay so all he said was it's time to go
[1:01:38] so we go she didn't hear another word
[1:01:41] about her for two months now when you
[1:01:44] hear about it on tape and think 64 he
[1:01:47] tells about some of this stuff he tells
[1:01:49] about how all the music and you think
[1:01:51] she's you know rock and roll band
[1:01:53] someplace no they're just do girls not
[1:01:54] piano but he tell us about the piano and
[1:01:59] how that all you know the world and he
[1:02:01] says but then she met George and he's a
[1:02:03] Christian huh
[1:02:04] so I was part of the picture didn't even
[1:02:07] know it you know and so what happened so
[1:02:10] during that time to transition from you
[1:02:12] know the piano to go into church with me
[1:02:15] because there was no church I was taking
[1:02:16] her to the Baptist Church yeah and so he
[1:02:19] was happy that she was in church
[1:02:20] sometimes he went with us yeah William
[1:02:23] Brandon went to Baptist Church because
[1:02:24] there wasn't any other Church there and
[1:02:26] he could say meant a part of the word so
[1:02:29] when you're on vacation in Florida you
[1:02:30] don't think there's a church around
[1:02:31] there's a church on every corner
[1:02:33] yeah just going through worship the Lord
[1:02:36] it's okay let your light shine and so I
[1:02:42] heard I was taken to church and he was
[1:02:45] he was thankful you know well life goes
[1:02:48] on and early June of 63 he's gonna he
[1:02:53] had a service in Tucson you can hear it
[1:02:56] on tape
[1:02:56] and so first time I'm seeing this you
[1:02:59] know now in the meantime he didn't give
[1:03:01] me a big stack of tapes to listen to he
[1:03:03] didn't give me an hour read this book no
[1:03:05] he just he could see that there was a
[1:03:07] seat in there there was gonna blossom
[1:03:09] out you know eventually and so he was
[1:03:11] very patient and so here I'm in this
[1:03:14] service and for the first time I'm
[1:03:17] seeing the ministry Wow different you
[1:03:22] know we don't do this the Baptist Church
[1:03:23] but it's all Bible there you couldn't
[1:03:25] you couldn't couldn't stick a pin
[1:03:26] anywhere and so I remember going home
[1:03:29] that night and and I said Lord this is
[1:03:31] either just straight from you or it's
[1:03:34] the greatest deception ever hit the
[1:03:35] planet you know but it was of God and
[1:03:38] God began to you know open my mind and
[1:03:40] to see that it's all Bible
[1:03:42] and of course I here I am the firstborn
[1:03:45] of this missionary family and they've
[1:03:48] got plans that I should go to Bible
[1:03:50] School and go in the same steps that
[1:03:52] they've been in and you know and here
[1:03:54] I'm taking this detour how others start
[1:03:56] wringing their hands what do we do you
[1:03:57] know of course they knew this name see I
[1:04:00] never heard that name before I did you
[1:04:02] know a lot of people today don't know
[1:04:04] about the name of William Branham well I
[1:04:06] had never heard that name so I wasn't
[1:04:08] scared of him and in here I was dating
[1:04:10] his daughter and my parents well they're
[1:04:14] trying to be nice because they know it's
[1:04:16] real they could see the reality of it
[1:04:18] but yet they can't just pitch in with it
[1:04:19] because they're good Baptist you know
[1:04:21] you got relatives like that and so they
[1:04:24] had a little bit of problem with that
[1:04:26] but when he was home he would take time
[1:04:28] to explain things you know we could talk
[1:04:30] about scriptures and things he loved to
[1:04:33] talk about the scriptures so he was a
[1:04:35] real friend and I was always welcome at
[1:04:38] their house I didn't have to sneak in
[1:04:39] the back door and come to the front door
[1:04:40] you know and so you might say well what
[1:04:43] attracted you to this ministry well it
[1:04:45] wasn't sitting in the benches watching
[1:04:47] the miracles you know I enjoyed that but
[1:04:50] what I saw in it was the fact that by
[1:04:54] the time I met this man I had already
[1:04:56] read my entire Bible twice now you can
[1:04:58] read your Bible this year if you just
[1:05:00] get your priorities straightened up they
[1:05:02] got they got a list over there at the
[1:05:04] Bible bookstore it's on the Internet
[1:05:05] you read certain verses every day by
[1:05:07] Christmas you've read it all so I had
[1:05:09] done that and he enjoyed reading or
[1:05:12] talking about the scriptures so what I
[1:05:15] saw in this man was somebody that was
[1:05:18] actually living the spirit of the
[1:05:20] Scriptures not because he went to Bible
[1:05:22] School but because it was real God was
[1:05:25] living through the man you know and so
[1:05:27] that's that was what I tracked me to
[1:05:30] this and so in like in 64 I think it was
[1:05:33] that I I wrote my letter
[1:05:34] you know resignation to the Baptist
[1:05:36] Church thank you very much but take my
[1:05:38] name off I got better things to do and
[1:05:41] so of course I enjoyed seeing the
[1:05:46] supernatural I wasn't trying to figure
[1:05:48] out how to do it it's just a blessing
[1:05:50] but the fact that it was the same spirit
[1:05:53] because you know brother Branham says
[1:05:54] you want
[1:05:55] to God read your Bible and pray we might
[1:05:59] get into that tomorrow with some more
[1:06:01] clues you know but one thing that I
[1:06:04] learned along the way was what I call
[1:06:08] the prophetic dimension now we have the
[1:06:11] scriptures where where Elijah and his
[1:06:13] his helper they're you know they were in
[1:06:14] the house and he says then go outside
[1:06:16] and see what's going on it goes out
[1:06:18] there there's all these horsemen all
[1:06:19] these soldiers and guns you know their
[1:06:22] spears and things and he comes banks is
[1:06:24] all we got a problem and all these
[1:06:26] people out there and now I didn't get
[1:06:28] all upset and smack him no he just put
[1:06:30] his hand on it the Lord opened young
[1:06:31] man's eyes and so he goes back out all
[1:06:34] those angels come from they were there
[1:06:36] all the time it's another dimension you
[1:06:39] know we can't see in that dimension
[1:06:41] because we're not geared for it but it
[1:06:43] is real and so brother Brent lived in
[1:06:45] that dimension over half of his time you
[1:06:48] go come you know and so because he was
[1:06:53] built that way
[1:06:54] so it's just something faster than the
[1:06:57] bench were in now but for example when
[1:06:59] he was in in Houston in the in the
[1:07:03] meeting there in January of 1950 it was
[1:07:05] a 10-day meeting and during this time
[1:07:08] there was the Baptist preacher that
[1:07:10] thought it was his job to prove that
[1:07:12] this was all false and that nobody
[1:07:14] should be listening and no they could've
[1:07:16] been a bunch of noise so brother
[1:07:17] Bosworth who's helping brother Branham
[1:07:19] at the time said that you know we need
[1:07:22] to we need to answer this man when you
[1:07:25] do it we need to do something because
[1:07:26] people are getting upset and brother
[1:07:29] Brent said no we're not gonna waste one
[1:07:30] night on one guy when hundreds need to
[1:07:32] be prayed for him and so brother
[1:07:37] Bosworth finally convinced him that he
[1:07:38] could handle it very carefully so
[1:07:41] brother Brent said okay go ahead and but
[1:07:44] don't you know so doesn't get ugly so
[1:07:47] fine so they they program this this
[1:07:50] meeting and where they had a building
[1:07:53] for eight thousand now they got a
[1:07:54] building for thirty thousand because a
[1:07:55] lot of people came to town to back up
[1:07:58] divine healing you know they want to see
[1:08:00] the show you know well the the night of
[1:08:06] the meeting brother Branham was gonna
[1:08:07] stay in hotel okay you guys
[1:08:08] take care of that I'll be back tomorrow
[1:08:09] well but the Holy Ghost says no you must
[1:08:12] go okay so he goes to church him and his
[1:08:15] brother and his wife and little Rebekah
[1:08:17] four years old hmm very important so
[1:08:21] they're going there now he says he
[1:08:22] disguised himself somehow I don't know
[1:08:24] what he looked like or what he did but
[1:08:25] somehow he got in there nobody knows him
[1:08:27] he goes way up in the balcony where he
[1:08:29] can see down the aisle and he's up there
[1:08:31] with his family and so this is going on
[1:08:34] down here and on the platform and we're
[1:08:37] kind of putting several tapes together
[1:08:38] to get the whole story here but he was
[1:08:44] up there watching and on the platform
[1:08:48] brother
[1:08:49] Bosworth says to the to the Baptist he
[1:08:53] said now I've got one question the 7
[1:08:57] compound names of Jehovah in the Old
[1:08:59] Testament a Redemption can we place
[1:09:01] those on Jesus Christ yes or no Oh think
[1:09:05] about this if I say no then there's no
[1:09:08] salvation and if I say yes that
[1:09:10] incorporates divine healing so he was a
[1:09:13] little bit of a bind you know well they
[1:09:16] had their bit of an argument and so
[1:09:19] finally at the end brother Bosworth says
[1:09:21] I believe are the rims in the building
[1:09:24] somewhere so he can come down and
[1:09:26] dismiss the audience so when he gets up
[1:09:28] now first of all you got to remember
[1:09:30] Rebecca is 4 years old it's the first
[1:09:32] time that she had sat with her dad in
[1:09:34] church all the other services she's
[1:09:38] sitting there with her mom and these
[1:09:39] other little girls who sit another
[1:09:40] daddy's lap her daddy's up here so here
[1:09:43] she is proud as all get-out you know and
[1:09:45] so then he gets up to come down here
[1:09:48] well he puts her in his seat and so she
[1:09:50] could see down here you know
[1:09:51] and so he comes down carefully he says
[1:09:57] on tape that there were so many sick
[1:10:00] people there he said cases that would
[1:10:02] make the heart or an Iron Man melt
[1:10:04] that's pretty serious
[1:10:05] that's not toothache you know and so um
[1:10:09] he said in 500 Usher's made a way for me
[1:10:12] to get down here okay well he gets down
[1:10:15] here and of course they had the
[1:10:17] professional photographers over here
[1:10:18] taking pictures because the Baptist was
[1:10:20] supposed to win and
[1:10:21] pictures would be the proof and you know
[1:10:23] he's right so they're taking pictures
[1:10:26] well as he's speaking the pillar fire
[1:10:30] comes in now on some tapes he sounds
[1:10:33] like there were some people that saw it
[1:10:35] but most of them didn't but we have the
[1:10:37] picture so when these guys go to develop
[1:10:40] their film that's the only picture they
[1:10:41] came out amazing okay so time goes on
[1:10:45] years later
[1:10:47] Rebecca's listening to the tape like
[1:10:49] like you would and she says to her mom
[1:10:51] now you know mom I was there and you
[1:10:53] were there did you see those five
[1:10:55] hundred Usher's I didn't see them and
[1:10:57] her mom says those weren't rushers those
[1:10:59] were angels well that's interesting so
[1:11:05] so then brother Branham you know he
[1:11:08] tells later he says you know the it's
[1:11:11] it's best if you have the picture
[1:11:12] because the real thing could come in
[1:11:13] here you guys could fool you so it's
[1:11:16] best to have that picture now the people
[1:11:18] that make fun of it well they're just
[1:11:19] signing their ticket to go somewhere
[1:11:21] else you know and there's one to tape or
[1:11:24] I think two or three occasions when he
[1:11:25] tell them tell us about this that he's
[1:11:28] got this lady coming in the prayer line
[1:11:30] and she's got her picture that she
[1:11:32] bought out front you know her Bible and
[1:11:34] he says oh I see you have a picture so
[1:11:36] he starts talking to her about the
[1:11:37] picture to establish the you know the
[1:11:39] relationship there in the discernment
[1:11:41] and he says um you know I've got a I've
[1:11:44] got a testimony on my desk at home where
[1:11:46] this lady was in the hospital and she
[1:11:49] was dying but she had that picture on
[1:11:51] the nightstand and by the hospital bed
[1:11:54] and the lady's testimony is that as she
[1:11:57] was praying the light comes off the
[1:11:59] picture came over her and she was healed
[1:12:01] went home now that's happened a lot of
[1:12:03] times throughout these last 50 years in
[1:12:05] different places so it is quite
[1:12:07] important but that's just one one case
[1:12:11] of the prophetic dimension where he
[1:12:13] could see things that you can't see
[1:12:16] brother Brennan explains that for
[1:12:18] example I see a prophet is also a seer
[1:12:20] so a seer can can look and see things
[1:12:23] and come back and tell us like when
[1:12:25] there's a big construction site they
[1:12:27] don't want people you know nose in and
[1:12:28] getting in a way they put the big fence
[1:12:30] around well a prophet seer can couldn't
[1:12:33] look over the fence and see this stuff
[1:12:35] okay now the challenge is I got to go
[1:12:37] back and tell these people but how much
[1:12:39] of this do I tell them and what words do
[1:12:41] I use and so that's what this message is
[1:12:43] all about where brother bran was
[1:12:44] relating to you what the whole picture
[1:12:47] is about okay
[1:12:50] there was another occasion when in 1960
[1:12:54] when is when his mother-in-law died now
[1:12:57] we all know that the mother-in-law his
[1:12:58] most precious person because of one for
[1:13:00] the mother-in-law we wouldn't have the
[1:13:00] beautiful wife right okay so the
[1:13:06] mother-in-law dies and so there they
[1:13:08] have the funeral of course wanted to be
[1:13:10] the good husband you know do everything
[1:13:11] right
[1:13:12] he's got his wife there and she's crying
[1:13:14] you know at the house and he said well
[1:13:16] honey what's wrong well bill she's so
[1:13:18] far away and everything he says no look
[1:13:21] I can't open your eyes you just have to
[1:13:23] believe me she's sitting right there on
[1:13:25] the sofa
[1:13:25] they're always far away is you want to
[1:13:28] put them in another place he says when
[1:13:31] you when you die and go to heaven you've
[1:13:34] got a million miles away right there
[1:13:36] just another dimension I'm saying well
[1:13:39] on December 29th of 1963 I visited the
[1:13:43] random Tabernacle for the first time and
[1:13:45] because you know when you're in love now
[1:13:48] we're all in love with her wife right
[1:13:50] you should be I'll come back with
[1:13:54] marriage counseling but when you're in
[1:13:59] love and your girl goes away for two
[1:14:01] weeks it's like five years just as you
[1:14:03] can see the end of it so I hitched a
[1:14:06] ride here they're either going away for
[1:14:08] Christmas in 1963 and so I hitched
[1:14:11] driving some other believers and I
[1:14:12] showed up you know Sunday morning the
[1:14:14] church and so he's preaching and and so
[1:14:18] then during the lunch time you know
[1:14:20] between services we went to lunch and
[1:14:22] and of course he knew that we Rebecca
[1:14:24] and I both were in music program at
[1:14:26] school and they in a church so he said
[1:14:28] look George tonight at the service I
[1:14:30] want you to sing me sing at the brand of
[1:14:33] tabernacle yeah I want you to say well
[1:14:35] what would I say well we're gonna have a
[1:14:36] prayer line tonight so it'd be nice if
[1:14:38] you sang that song then Jesus came well
[1:14:41] I've never heard that song and Rebecca
[1:14:43] had never played it but we learned it
[1:14:45] and you know she played and I sang that
[1:14:48] night
[1:14:48] he was very proud that his little girl
[1:14:50] had played in church because she was
[1:14:52] playing a lot of classical music and so
[1:14:55] here she was in church but anyway then
[1:14:57] he came out and preached look away to
[1:14:59] Jesus
[1:14:59] yeah well time goes on 1964 we graduated
[1:15:05] from high school together and it's very
[1:15:08] proud day because you know here our
[1:15:11] parents were sitting there together and
[1:15:13] a whole thing about graduation and he
[1:15:15] said finally a brand of us graduated
[1:15:17] because before that they were all
[1:15:19] they've quit school and went to work you
[1:15:21] know so here one graduate is very very
[1:15:23] proud day for him in July of 64 you can
[1:15:28] hear the tape of the mighty God unveiled
[1:15:32] in Philadelphia now when you went to
[1:15:34] church with brother Branham you know
[1:15:35] when you rode in the car then you would
[1:15:37] get there and church is already going on
[1:15:39] he would come in time to you know preach
[1:15:40] she's not going to be there for all the
[1:15:42] preliminaries so when they get there
[1:15:45] well it's it's it's brother Branham and
[1:15:47] Billy Paul and then Rebecca and her
[1:15:49] friend Betty well so they get here and
[1:15:51] there's no chairs so it was a big hotel
[1:15:54] so up in the Meza net you know like in
[1:15:55] the Florida half up there they had some
[1:15:58] like a railing so they put some chairs
[1:16:00] up there so Rebecca and her friend they
[1:16:02] sat up there and watched
[1:16:03] so when brother n came in it had a big
[1:16:05] long table and all Roberts were speaking
[1:16:08] before he did so brother brems sits down
[1:16:11] beside him you know beside the beside
[1:16:14] the podium and while brother Roberts is
[1:16:17] speaking brother bran reaches out and
[1:16:18] just kind of touches his coach you know
[1:16:20] and so then he gets up and preaches that
[1:16:22] mighty message and so then as they're
[1:16:25] leaving to go back to the hotel Rebecca
[1:16:27] says I saw what you did and he said oh
[1:16:33] assist that was the nicest coach you
[1:16:36] know probably some $1000 sitting at the
[1:16:38] time and he looked down he had on his
[1:16:40] his you know 2995 from Sears and the
[1:16:45] coat didn't match the pants you know
[1:16:47] what it wasn't supposed to be like your
[1:16:49] pastor I mean that we did this on
[1:16:50] purpose
[1:16:53] but but his visit was just a shade
[1:16:57] different one was darker brown or
[1:16:59] whatever and he felt kind of embarrassed
[1:17:01] but the point is the they're both
[1:17:03] ministers both both sent from God but
[1:17:06] one had a gift the other one actually
[1:17:09] had something to say but the appearance
[1:17:10] wasn't all that great he just had to say
[1:17:12] something yeah it's not a message
[1:17:14] whereas old Roberts had to have
[1:17:16] everything just perfect and all
[1:17:18] gold-plated and everything and it was a
[1:17:20] gift but it wasn't to perfect the bride
[1:17:22] you know so some of those things that
[1:17:26] that you know I learned along the way
[1:17:29] another place you'll find where brother
[1:17:32] M says now he was in a big High School
[1:17:34] Auditorium you know big curtains behind
[1:17:36] him and at the end of the service he
[1:17:37] said now I want to show you the reason
[1:17:40] for the success of these meetings which
[1:17:42] everybody thinks it's the great gift and
[1:17:43] because he's a prayer warrior which is
[1:17:45] true but he said I want to show you the
[1:17:47] reason so they really stood the curtains
[1:17:48] and back here behind the curtains was
[1:17:51] old John Ryan out there stretched out
[1:17:53] praying yeah so those are some of the
[1:17:56] things that that I learned along the way
[1:17:58] and it just makes the message more real
[1:18:01] you know now we do have to say a few
[1:18:04] things about the courtship it or I can
[1:18:05] tell you all the secrets we couldn't
[1:18:08] have dates during the week because we
[1:18:09] were in school you know and when we did
[1:18:12] go out and she had been by 11 o'clock
[1:18:13] and so I think it was either the first
[1:18:16] of the second date that you know we've
[1:18:19] been out and they come home and so they
[1:18:21] lived you know you know an apartment and
[1:18:25] so I just kind of there's no traffic you
[1:18:27] know 10:30 at night so I just kind of
[1:18:29] eased up parked on the wrong side of the
[1:18:31] road and so we're just sitting there
[1:18:33] talking a little bit well here comes
[1:18:35] this car with the bright lights on and
[1:18:37] so I blast the bright lights and the
[1:18:41] lights go down wouldn't you know it it's
[1:18:43] brother branham holding right behind me
[1:18:45] in part you know
[1:18:47] he had a lot of grace but you know a lot
[1:18:52] of people found out that he had a
[1:18:54] telephone obviously you know but back
[1:18:57] then we didn't have the wireless and we
[1:18:59] didn't have our little little friends
[1:19:01] there you know home and so we only lived
[1:19:06] a block and a half away but we still
[1:19:08] like talk on the phone just what people
[1:19:10] are and so at my house we had the black
[1:19:14] phone on the wall with a dial you know
[1:19:15] and he had to kind of see wouldn't be
[1:19:19] the best time because my dad had this of
[1:19:21] course raising all his kids
[1:19:22] he said now look the telephone is not
[1:19:25] for visiting telephone is only for
[1:19:27] communication okay got it
[1:19:30] but when he needed to visit that was
[1:19:32] different so I had to kind of gauge my
[1:19:37] time when I could use it you know so at
[1:19:40] the prophets house brother branham's
[1:19:41] house they had they had the phone but it
[1:19:44] was the touchstone you come out with
[1:19:45] that now wow that's nice but it's still
[1:19:47] stuck to the wall you didn't have the
[1:19:49] wireless and so a lot of people found
[1:19:52] out his number and they would call for
[1:19:53] everything I mean he had a lot of
[1:19:56] patience because you know I don't care
[1:19:59] what color car you buy or you got to
[1:20:01] think we'll go to the dentist you know
[1:20:02] there's some common sense that he used
[1:20:04] but he was really nice but you don't he
[1:20:10] got fed up too so he's looking at the
[1:20:12] phone one day well on the bottom of the
[1:20:13] phone there was this dial he could turn
[1:20:15] if you turn to one way the ringer got
[1:20:17] louder if you turned guiltily it the
[1:20:19] ringer goes off well guess what he
[1:20:21] turned it off
[1:20:23] so when when somebody's calling you can
[1:20:26] hear ringing here but you can't hear
[1:20:28] ringing over there because it's turned
[1:20:29] off and he he just had the idea that
[1:20:31] well they'll figure it out and they'll
[1:20:33] call Billy Paul get an appointment you
[1:20:34] know they're supposed to but Rebecca
[1:20:37] says well what are we going to do you
[1:20:39] know I said it's real simple you set
[1:20:43] your watch just like mine right there
[1:20:44] okay
[1:20:45] now I'll see the things are okay at my
[1:20:49] house but you know it's seven o'clock
[1:20:51] I'm gonna call you now
[1:20:53] phone's not gonna ring thanks to your
[1:20:55] dad but if at seven o'clock
[1:20:59] you pick it up I'll be there so she'd
[1:21:01] pick it up and you know real quietly cuz
[1:21:03] nobody heard the phone ring hello and so
[1:21:06] I had this big little long cord so she'd
[1:21:07] go off and hide in the closet we could
[1:21:09] have some privacy so love conquers all
[1:21:14] now I had this like say had this 59 Ford
[1:21:20] truck okay it was not brand new but it
[1:21:23] was clean you know
[1:21:24] well Road ramen is kindness he said
[1:21:26] where he's my car well he had this 1955
[1:21:29] Cadillac brought along as this building
[1:21:31] is wide you know and it had a big v8
[1:21:36] engine and we had to buy the expensive
[1:21:39] gas for it yeah thirty-six cents a
[1:21:42] gallon
[1:21:43] we could put twenty-two cents a mike
[1:21:45] truck you know and
[1:21:47] okay the reason he had this Cadillac he
[1:21:50] wasn't a person he liked a car that
[1:21:55] would be functional he traded his Ford
[1:21:58] station wagon every two years because of
[1:21:59] high mileage he liked something that's
[1:22:01] gonna work well the Christian
[1:22:04] businessmen bless their heart they
[1:22:06] thought that he should have a Cadillac
[1:22:07] he kept on no I don't want a Cadillac
[1:22:09] well brother organ bride who is the
[1:22:13] International treasurer of the
[1:22:14] organization he would get his new
[1:22:16] Cadillac every year you know October or
[1:22:18] so and so when he was getting DLitt when
[1:22:23] he got delivery of his 1956 Cadillac he
[1:22:26] got two of his flunkies they said no
[1:22:28] take this car from California driver to
[1:22:30] Jeffersonville and don't talk to nobody
[1:22:32] just give them the keys and come home
[1:22:34] okay so they
[1:22:35] take the car and they take it over there
[1:22:37] and and so brother Ren comes home the
[1:22:40] week or so later Wow where'd this car so
[1:22:43] he puts it in the garage
[1:22:44] you don't nobody see it it puts in the
[1:22:46] garage is there for like six months
[1:22:47] until he put a little piece in the paper
[1:22:50] yeah I'm gonna be driving this blue and
[1:22:52] white car and it's not bought with your
[1:22:54] money
[1:22:54] there was a gift and kind of disclaimer
[1:22:56] read on well so that's what they drove
[1:22:58] out to Arizona along with the station
[1:23:00] wagon and so we could you know we take
[1:23:01] it on a date well it's huge car and so
[1:23:07] you know with the expensive gas but that
[1:23:09] we could drive it to church and things
[1:23:11] you know news it was nice and flashing
[1:23:13] but Rebecca told him one time about
[1:23:16] being in a restaurant they were in a
[1:23:18] restaurant eating lunch one day and so
[1:23:20] as they're sitting there with over to
[1:23:22] another table was a policeman and he had
[1:23:24] ordered his food so what by the time is
[1:23:26] just as his food is coming to the table
[1:23:28] his radio started blasting and he was
[1:23:31] needed so he dropped everything and took
[1:23:33] off the lights flashing and so
[1:23:36] everybody's kind of nervous and brother
[1:23:37] Graham said it's nothing to worry about
[1:23:39] over there a few blocks little boy fell
[1:23:41] out of a tree and broke his arm he's
[1:23:42] gonna be okay so Rebecca said no we knew
[1:23:45] that everybody's daddy didn't do that
[1:23:47] yeah but okay we come to May of 16 in
[1:23:55] 1964 the Lord showed him that you're
[1:23:59] gonna stay here you know you need to
[1:24:01] find a house and settle down here in
[1:24:03] Arizona so he started looking for a
[1:24:07] place and he said the Holy Ghost
[1:24:09] directed him right to the just one house
[1:24:11] it's on a cul-de-sac and this old fella
[1:24:13] had built these three houses and not
[1:24:15] finished and then kind of a what'd he
[1:24:18] call it where you finish it yourself
[1:24:21] gonna get a better price well you I'll
[1:24:23] expect homes so he he saw this house and
[1:24:28] instead of the eaves going off you know
[1:24:30] like this building here where it blocks
[1:24:32] the view the eaves went up in other
[1:24:34] words there was a slanted roof and you
[1:24:36] can see the mountain so well so he liked
[1:24:38] that and it had space out there to build
[1:24:40] on the dinner room that he always wanted
[1:24:41] so he really liked it and so as they're
[1:24:44] making the deal
[1:24:46] he's standing in the doorway looking out
[1:24:48] in the the builders the outside looking
[1:24:51] in they're standing there talking
[1:24:52] well Joseph's about seven or eight years
[1:24:55] old at the time and so he's running his
[1:24:57] finger up the door jamb you know like
[1:24:59] kids do and headed for the you know the
[1:25:02] where the lock goes in so brother Bray
[1:25:04] understand they're talking and as he's
[1:25:09] talking he reaches in takes out his
[1:25:10] knife keeps talking to a man he just
[1:25:13] sticks there in that hole he comes out
[1:25:15] with a scorpion and joseph was headed
[1:25:18] right for it you know so that's that
[1:25:20] other dimension see he knew it was there
[1:25:22] he knew how to get to it a lot of that
[1:25:24] kind of stuff happened a lot of times
[1:25:26] there was a case when in Jeffersonville
[1:25:31] the church that one of the members live
[1:25:34] next door to a church Christ man so he's
[1:25:37] always asked him you need to come to my
[1:25:38] church this Sunday you don't come well
[1:25:40] finally one Sunday the church Christ man
[1:25:41] says okay I'll go with you tonight so
[1:25:43] they come to church and it was communion
[1:25:46] night okay so closed communities when
[1:25:49] it's just us well open can be used if
[1:25:51] you say you're a Christian you've
[1:25:52] received the Lord then you can come down
[1:25:53] have communion also if you don't even go
[1:25:54] here so they have open communion and so
[1:25:57] they're all you know that rose standing
[1:25:59] there taking the communion and this mr.
[1:26:02] Hill the church Christ man his testimony
[1:26:05] is that as he's standing there with his
[1:26:06] friend and you know in the communion
[1:26:08] line he heard brother Neville say to
[1:26:11] brother Branham brother Branham we ran
[1:26:13] out of wine what we're gonna do that's
[1:26:16] kind of embarrassing you know and so
[1:26:17] brother Brent says well we'll just pray
[1:26:19] that's no problem
[1:26:21] so mr. Hill you kept one eye open see
[1:26:23] what's going on and so as brother brems
[1:26:26] praying the little church little glasses
[1:26:28] filled up with wine not from water from
[1:26:31] nothing you know and so so then we get
[1:26:36] into 1965 I get the may of 65 okay I
[1:26:40] didn't have I didn't have a job I didn't
[1:26:44] have a car I didn't have a house didn't
[1:26:46] have any money but I thought I needed a
[1:26:48] wife
[1:26:51] you know I was young I've learned a few
[1:26:55] things these years but anyway so I go up
[1:26:58] to talk to brother bran of course had to
[1:26:59] figure out when he's home when he's not
[1:27:00] real busy you know on stuff and so we go
[1:27:04] in we talked for a while and just the
[1:27:06] two of us and so he's tell me all about
[1:27:08] the meetings and all the different
[1:27:09] places he's been the bunch of stuff and
[1:27:11] so finalists in the program this is all
[1:27:13] wonderful but I've come without you know
[1:27:16] particularly thing I wanna talk about oh
[1:27:17] hold that be well he's looking right
[1:27:20] through me you know and I said well you
[1:27:24] must have noticed that I really like
[1:27:25] your daughter and I'd like them I'm here
[1:27:28] to ask for your permission your blessing
[1:27:29] that we could get married oh then things
[1:27:33] changed
[1:27:34] he said no look I'm gonna give you
[1:27:38] permission to be engaged but don't even
[1:27:41] think about marriage until you both have
[1:27:43] the baptism the Holy Ghost because you
[1:27:45] see all these other cases around here
[1:27:47] well let it be a lesson well from that
[1:27:50] I've come up with a saying today that I
[1:27:53] tell girls everywhere there's worse
[1:27:56] things than going through life single
[1:27:58] just look around okay well so that was
[1:28:04] in May and then in June they took off
[1:28:09] again for the summer you know
[1:28:10] jeffersonville and that's when he
[1:28:12] preached the anointed ones at the end
[1:28:14] time I was sitting like from here to the
[1:28:15] Oregon Washington preach that but it's
[1:28:18] just going over you know years later
[1:28:20] when it started make sense and so I you
[1:28:23] know again I hits back there and so I
[1:28:25] was there for a couple of weeks when
[1:28:26] he's preaching some of these messages so
[1:28:28] we come down to April first
[1:28:31] I'm sorry August first which was a
[1:28:33] Sunday and I knew we were going to be
[1:28:36] going to to back to Tucson I was gonna
[1:28:38] ride with him going back and I said you
[1:28:40] know I asked him that Sunday afternoon I
[1:28:43] said now would it be possible that
[1:28:45] there's time for you to baptize me
[1:28:47] correctly before we go back to Arizona
[1:28:48] oh sure
[1:28:50] well he'd been waiting almost three
[1:28:51] years for that you know and so there was
[1:28:53] a he was glad to do it well so we go
[1:28:57] down Monday morning and he asked his
[1:28:59] brother brother doc to get
[1:29:01] few witnesses to be sitting out there
[1:29:03] and so we come into the back street he
[1:29:06] didn't have a shirt on he's a little bit
[1:29:07] embarrassed because a couple of ladies
[1:29:08] there and so he baptized me correctly in
[1:29:11] the tabernacle well it turns out that's
[1:29:14] the last person he baptized we didn't
[1:29:16] know that then you know and so now we're
[1:29:20] back in Tucson August of sixty-five and
[1:29:24] by then I had the baptism
[1:29:27] I had the girl you know pretty much
[1:29:29] secured and and and had a car a nice car
[1:29:38] used cars and so we're driving around
[1:29:41] one day in the car and I don't know how
[1:29:44] we got to the subject but he says no
[1:29:46] George if you ever get the opportunity
[1:29:48] to go to Israel your Bible will be a
[1:29:50] brand-new book well that's interesting
[1:29:52] but I wasn't thinking about Israel I'm
[1:29:54] saying about the girl it got to be
[1:29:56] honest so sure enough eight years later
[1:30:00] after a whole lot of things happen we
[1:30:03] went the first time in Israel Wow
[1:30:05] the Bible's real here's what happened
[1:30:08] you know here's Sea of Galilee here's
[1:30:09] all this all these things and so he was
[1:30:13] I think he was seeing something wasn't
[1:30:16] just you know vain words he was seeing
[1:30:21] something then get me started well so I
[1:30:24] went the first time in 73 and in 1984 we
[1:30:28] started taking you know small group so
[1:30:31] this past November at strip number 37 so
[1:30:34] we know where everything is and how many
[1:30:37] wants your pastor to go
[1:30:39] [Laughter]
[1:30:41] we're gonna have to do better than that
[1:30:44] but it's it's a real blessing to go over
[1:30:47] there now fact his brother Bram never
[1:30:50] went Israel there's no evidence they
[1:30:52] everywhere now he'd read about it he
[1:30:53] knew people from there but when we're
[1:30:56] over there and when we might no play a
[1:30:59] portion of a tape or something
[1:31:00] well the Israeli guide says he was never
[1:31:03] here huh he talks like somebody's been
[1:31:05] here a hundred times he's describing
[1:31:07] things in detail you know and so he says
[1:31:10] yeah he's a prophet no doubt yeah so the
[1:31:13] he's seen these stuff by vision so when
[1:31:15] you hear him tell things on tape he's
[1:31:17] not making it up now he wasn't a
[1:31:21] religious person but he was he was a
[1:31:24] natural-born Irish storyteller they can
[1:31:29] get into the colors and you're right in
[1:31:30] the driver's seat but he's seen things
[1:31:32] he's seeing all those things well in
[1:31:37] September of 65 we were in the meeting
[1:31:42] and in Phoenix because he preached a lot
[1:31:44] of times in Phoenix for the Christian
[1:31:45] businessman well so at this meeting in
[1:31:48] Phoenix sister Rebecca had a real good
[1:31:51] friend her name is back then was sure
[1:31:54] and Riley and so Sharon's dad was a song
[1:31:57] leader or something and so they were
[1:31:59] friends a similar age and so Rebecca
[1:32:01] comes into the big hotel lobby there
[1:32:03] where the meeting was and she's flashing
[1:32:05] her ringing on and and so Sharon says
[1:32:08] but Rebecca
[1:32:10] he's Baptist or she fell to tell that
[1:32:14] guy she was seeing was an atheist but
[1:32:19] and so Rebecca says yeah but Danny likes
[1:32:21] him there's the end of the argument you
[1:32:27] know excuse me ma'am
[1:32:32] well the fact is that in September of 65
[1:32:43] I'll see all during since since the
[1:32:45] beginning 65 they're working on this
[1:32:47] house but in the carpet and painting a
[1:32:50] bunch of different things
[1:32:51] well brother Perry greens mother living
[1:32:53] in Beaumont Texas was a seamstress so
[1:32:56] she got involved making all the drapes
[1:32:58] for the house so in September brother
[1:33:01] Perry was out in Tucson putting it the
[1:33:03] drapes and have had some services so
[1:33:06] brother Branham says to him not to me
[1:33:09] but he said to brother Perry it looks
[1:33:11] like this kid's gonna be my son-in-law
[1:33:12] why don't you take him home and pray for
[1:33:14] the Holy Ghost now why didn't brother
[1:33:16] Brennan just put his hand on me be done
[1:33:17] with it
[1:33:18] it wasn't God's plan God has a way of
[1:33:21] doing things and only he can arrange the
[1:33:24] details so brother Greene says so are
[1:33:28] you working no well come on home with me
[1:33:30] well how many of you knew brother Perry
[1:33:32] yeah well the way he would tell things
[1:33:35] sound like he had this big ranch you
[1:33:37] know he had nothing we we get down there
[1:33:42] and he lived in three rooms behind the
[1:33:44] church you know so anyway my room didn't
[1:33:48] have air conditioning that's when I
[1:33:49] learned about humidity Beaumont Texas
[1:33:53] summertime and so about the second or
[1:33:58] third day that I was there brother
[1:34:02] Richard Blair came over from Louisiana
[1:34:04] to use brother Perry's phone to call
[1:34:06] brother Branham about some problem so
[1:34:08] when he called in brother brand was
[1:34:09] already out of the house but they
[1:34:10] promised when he comes back he'll call
[1:34:12] you so these two guys are sitting there
[1:34:14] by the phone waiting most of the day I
[1:34:16] was over in my room reading my Bible and
[1:34:20] so at some point I thought yeah but it
[1:34:26] was thought to be praying maybe we could
[1:34:28] just pray together I didn't know why it
[1:34:29] was there nobody told ah nobody told me
[1:34:31] I was there
[1:34:33] I was just there as a visitor and I
[1:34:35] thought it'd be good if we prayed so we
[1:34:37] go into the Sunday School room we kneel
[1:34:39] down at a branch we're praying and while
[1:34:41] we're praying it seemed like that the
[1:34:43] sky was was you know when it's cloudy
[1:34:44] and then there's the rays of light come
[1:34:47] down through the clouds well that's what
[1:34:48] it seemed like I could see in my mind
[1:34:50] you know and so one of these rays is
[1:34:53] coming to me well just within a half a
[1:34:56] minute the phone rings well so we were
[1:34:59] finished praying so brother green goes
[1:35:00] answers phone and it's brother Branham
[1:35:04] calling for the Blair but he said but
[1:35:06] first let me talk to George so I took
[1:35:09] the phone and greeted him he said Oh
[1:35:10] George let me be the first in
[1:35:12] congratulating you on receiving the
[1:35:13] baptismal Holy Ghost
[1:35:14] oh so that's what that was and he knew
[1:35:18] that was he knew I was pretty
[1:35:20] hard-headed you know and he was helping
[1:35:22] me out to identify what had happened
[1:35:24] well so all these years later it's not
[1:35:27] so much his words about it but the fact
[1:35:30] that God is actually doing something and
[1:35:31] it's better every day you know well so I
[1:35:36] was that was one of them so it's in
[1:35:40] Texas well the next day I get a letter
[1:35:41] from my mother or a call from my mother
[1:35:43] in Tucson and she had a letter from
[1:35:45] President Johnson that they needed me in
[1:35:47] the US Army oh okay so I went back home
[1:35:50] flew home and within a week I was a
[1:35:53] soldier with Holy Ghost so God does
[1:35:56] everything right on time you know yeah
[1:35:58] and well so I'm in a diamond down there
[1:36:04] in Louisiana and in Fort Polk and then
[1:36:06] in the army and brother brems preaching
[1:36:09] in November there in Shreveport so
[1:36:12] Rebecca come down we went up there to
[1:36:14] the meetings well on Saturday I had a
[1:36:16] few minutes with him now at that point I
[1:36:18] was just a just finishing basic training
[1:36:21] I didn't know what they were gonna do
[1:36:22] with me if I was gonna be you know what
[1:36:25] and and there's some hot spots on the
[1:36:28] earth you know there was Selma Alabama
[1:36:31] and there was Watts California and there
[1:36:33] was Vietnam and so I you know whatever
[1:36:37] God wanted I didn't care but I just you
[1:36:39] know I just wanted him to pray so I'm
[1:36:42] just talking to him he didn't even pray
[1:36:44] he said don't worry
[1:36:46] footsteps of the righteous ordered of
[1:36:47] the Lord well the burden rolled off I
[1:36:51] got back to the army they made me a cook
[1:36:56] so I could I can take care of me and a
[1:36:59] few others you know well so that was
[1:37:03] November of 65 and then then in December
[1:37:09] well then the family's gonna house is
[1:37:11] finished now still an apartment so the
[1:37:14] family is going to go back to two of
[1:37:16] Indiana for the Christmas holidays but
[1:37:18] they're gonna leave Rebecca in Tucson to
[1:37:20] move all the stuff into the new house so
[1:37:23] when they come back from Jeffersonville
[1:37:25] they go right to the new house that was
[1:37:27] the plan so I was home for like two
[1:37:29] weeks for Christmas from from the army
[1:37:31] and so brother brems gonna leave now
[1:37:34] when he travelled he'd like to leave
[1:37:37] early he didn't care everybody goes to
[1:37:39] sleep all day he wants to get there so
[1:37:42] at six o'clock he's moving and and so
[1:37:46] another thing is that he if he was
[1:37:48] traveling by himself or was a Billy Paul
[1:37:50] he was just wear some blue jeans and
[1:37:52] boots or something you know didn't
[1:37:53] matter but if he's traveling with the
[1:37:54] family he'd dress up a little better you
[1:37:56] know find her clothes and another thing
[1:38:01] is that when he when he packed his
[1:38:02] suitcase the Bible is always the last
[1:38:03] thing in because he says on tape nothing
[1:38:06] goes on top of a brother
[1:38:07] that's God's and print and we don't put
[1:38:10] nothing on top so I wasn't gonna get him
[1:38:13] at five o'clock and go say goodbye I was
[1:38:15] gonna go in the night before you know so
[1:38:17] I went up the evening before and so I'm
[1:38:21] in the room with him and and I noticed
[1:38:23] on the chair by the door was the was the
[1:38:26] the blue jeans
[1:38:27] it was rougher clothes and such was his
[1:38:31] way of doing things that I had to ask
[1:38:32] why why is this how come he wear these
[1:38:35] clothes well a guy never knows when he
[1:38:37] might have car trouble well I knew that
[1:38:40] this guy never had car trouble because
[1:38:42] he kept it in perfect condition so I
[1:38:44] didn't say anything he didn't say
[1:38:46] anything but within 24 hours he was in a
[1:38:48] bad head-on collision in West Texas and
[1:38:51] so we were out eating it
[1:38:55] we were guests at brother Perry house
[1:38:56] that evening when we got the call and so
[1:38:59] on Sunday we flew over there you know
[1:39:02] because the wreck happened on Saturday
[1:39:03] evening so on Sunday we flew over and we
[1:39:07] were there at the hospital and he was in
[1:39:09] intensive care and had to trake Ian's
[1:39:12] they couldn't talk at the head bandaged
[1:39:14] there's a pretty bad situation and the
[1:39:19] of course there's people everywhere you
[1:39:21] know there's quite a few people there
[1:39:22] was no cell phone so they're putting
[1:39:24] coins in the phone and reporting back
[1:39:26] home what they seen heard and a lot of
[1:39:28] opinions going on and oh it can't happen
[1:39:30] and this and that well I'm just watching
[1:39:32] all this and so I'm in the intensive
[1:39:37] care where he was there was 12 beds and
[1:39:40] I got in to see him once because you'd
[1:39:43] only be in there like five minutes you
[1:39:44] know and so after during the days that
[1:39:49] he was there all the other eleven beds
[1:39:51] got well moved on but on the evening of
[1:39:54] December 24th God said that's enough
[1:39:58] took him home and it was very traumatic
[1:40:01] we didn't expect that but God knows what
[1:40:05] he's doing because while he was here we
[1:40:08] were just going to this meeting and that
[1:40:09] meeting and watching nobody's paying
[1:40:11] attention what he said you know the
[1:40:13] church age book had just come out and it
[1:40:16] came out in December and he left within
[1:40:18] 30 days so wasn't even people studying
[1:40:20] that yet and there was there was no
[1:40:23] folios there was no computer you know
[1:40:25] these big old tapes and and it goes by
[1:40:27] you think you heard something and maybe
[1:40:29] you didn't you didn't well anyway he he
[1:40:34] definitely suffered a lot but God had a
[1:40:37] plan you know and the fact that he left
[1:40:43] on that day well that was God's plan we
[1:40:46] were like the disciples wouldn't
[1:40:47] despondent know now what I'm gonna do
[1:40:49] nobody's could take its place you know
[1:40:51] that's when we had to get Benny you know
[1:40:54] get serious every guy that's got to pray
[1:40:56] for himself now we got to get serious
[1:40:57] okay what did he actually say I mean
[1:40:59] it's glorious message from God well
[1:41:01] let's see what he said but he said right
[1:41:03] on this one tape said you're going to
[1:41:04] find out one of these days that when you
[1:41:06] go to heaven you don't fly off somewhere
[1:41:08] else
[1:41:08] you're still right here just in another
[1:41:11] dimension faster than this
[1:41:14] okay so then they they transported the
[1:41:18] body over to Jeffersonville and we flew
[1:41:20] over there I couldn't stay for the
[1:41:22] funeral because it wasn't a blood
[1:41:23] relative I had to get back to the army
[1:41:25] so on the December 29th they had the
[1:41:28] funeral but sister Brandon was hurt so
[1:41:30] bad in the accident she couldn't decide
[1:41:33] whether the burial should be in Tucson
[1:41:35] or in Jeffersonville
[1:41:37] you know there's no life out there or
[1:41:38] what the church is and so the funeral
[1:41:43] director said don't worry I can play
[1:41:46] shank take care of you know when you all
[1:41:48] decide then we'll have a burial well you
[1:41:50] know the word says in 2nd Timothy 1:7
[1:41:52] for God has not given us the spirit of
[1:41:54] fear but of power love and a sound mind
[1:41:57] and in Philippians and the peace of God
[1:42:00] which passes all understanding all past
[1:42:04] all the things you can understand shall
[1:42:06] keep your hearts and minds through
[1:42:07] Christ Jesus so we learn to listen and
[1:42:09] we learned to pray and I wasn't there
[1:42:12] they're there they're out there by their
[1:42:13] self you know I was far away in the army
[1:42:15] and so God was on the scene and then so
[1:42:22] I mean I mean you know the army learned
[1:42:24] how to cook which it's a whole other
[1:42:27] story but they're good recipes just got
[1:42:31] people don't care you know
[1:42:33] so when I'm finishing the cook school
[1:42:36] part then I've got my papers where I'm
[1:42:39] going next
[1:42:39] well I knew God had done something for
[1:42:42] me and I knew God Sutton did something
[1:42:44] for Rebecca so I thought now's the time
[1:42:46] to pop the question I stood in line at
[1:42:49] the army base but my quarters in called
[1:42:51] her and I said hey yeah let's get
[1:42:54] married next Tuesday ok let's do it so I
[1:42:58] went home and we had a private ceremony
[1:43:00] at the house with the families and then
[1:43:03] we took off on a honeymoon back to
[1:43:05] Jeffersonville where they've got the
[1:43:07] burial planned for Monday August the
[1:43:10] 11th there April the 11th and so we're
[1:43:14] there for that now that Monday was a
[1:43:17] rainy day
[1:43:18] okay and Billy Paul had always kept
[1:43:22] a relationship with his grandmother
[1:43:24] sister hopes mother but she was a very
[1:43:26] difficult person very hard never went to
[1:43:29] church never saw her cry just you know
[1:43:31] well those kind of grandmas so when he's
[1:43:34] going to the burial he takes his two
[1:43:36] little boys and leaves him with his
[1:43:38] grandmother while he goes with his wife
[1:43:40] to the burial just a couple blocks away
[1:43:42] and it's raining so when he comes back
[1:43:45] to pick up his little boys for the first
[1:43:48] time he sees grandma wiping her face she
[1:43:51] said even the heavens weep for that man
[1:43:56] so we left that day
[1:43:58] flew to California and on the 15th of
[1:44:01] April I flew off to Vietnam for one year
[1:44:04] no phone no Skype no vacation only
[1:44:08] letters so when you get a letter oh oh I
[1:44:10] get those letters not to smell let me
[1:44:12] know there were two me there weren't all
[1:44:14] those other guys I'd golf someplace now
[1:44:16] to open up room read it myself I could
[1:44:18] read between the lines if that was the
[1:44:20] only communication we had these guys
[1:44:21] today they got skypes like they're
[1:44:23] living across the street you know so
[1:44:25] anyway I came back from the Army and I
[1:44:29] finally got out in October of 67 and
[1:44:33] immediately went to work with
[1:44:35] translating the message for spoken word
[1:44:37] got busy with translation process and I
[1:44:40] didn't know a lot of you know I didn't
[1:44:43] know everything at that point I had to I
[1:44:44] had to do some studying and okay the
[1:44:46] accident goes here the comma goes here
[1:44:48] and you know to make something readable
[1:44:51] for all those people out there that want
[1:44:54] to know what he said it's one thing to
[1:44:56] open your Bible yeah God says you sent a
[1:44:57] prophet well there is okay what do you
[1:44:59] say well if you don't have anything to
[1:45:00] give them you know so missionary working
[1:45:03] incorporates a lot of stuff so um and
[1:45:06] we're not like the the people that come
[1:45:08] to buy - to your door you know I'm
[1:45:11] talking about
[1:45:12] we're not out to get everybody in this
[1:45:15] church we're just looking for those
[1:45:16] Eagles that are out there don't know
[1:45:17] there he goes and so the life is what
[1:45:20] shows they want to know why do you have
[1:45:23] long hair
[1:45:23] well don't be telling brother Graham
[1:45:25] said so that's no that's that's not
[1:45:26] that's not a good answer you got to go
[1:45:28] on first Corinthians you got to know
[1:45:29] this scripture says we are scripture
[1:45:32] believers and see when we go to Israel
[1:45:35] here we are here's the the the Orthodox
[1:45:38] ladies they dress just like you they
[1:45:40] have a nice long here all the little
[1:45:42] girls have pleated skirts beautiful
[1:45:43] people and then there's all these stupid
[1:45:45] Christians that are dressed any which
[1:45:49] way you know and then there's us
[1:45:51] so they wonder who are you people you
[1:45:54] look like our people
[1:45:55] so I finally realized the right answer
[1:45:58] we are the Orthodox of the Protestants
[1:46:00] oh okay yeah okay so we're married like
[1:46:10] saying that was March 30th of 1966 and
[1:46:14] so then I was gone okay okay so gonna
[1:46:17] fast-forward 40 years okay now we moved
[1:46:21] over to Tennessee in 1999 and so within
[1:46:27] a couple of years
[1:46:29] Rebekah start developing what ended up
[1:46:32] being a tumor so she finally found a
[1:46:35] doctor that would take care of it and so
[1:46:37] she had a cancer operation and she's
[1:46:40] very sick so the tumor was attached to
[1:46:42] the kidney so when they took the kidney
[1:46:45] and the tumor out her besides a football
[1:46:47] so then she only had one kidney well
[1:46:49] this went on and by 2006 she was quite
[1:46:53] ill she had been through three or four
[1:46:55] major operations and you got to realize
[1:46:58] this wasn't just somebody down the
[1:46:59] street this is a lady that had been
[1:47:01] living with William Brannon for 20 years
[1:47:03] she knew what faithless you know what
[1:47:04] miracles were and so but I can see that
[1:47:09] each day things were getting worse when
[1:47:10] everything could medically and everybody
[1:47:12] was praying you know and so I said no
[1:47:16] look you know that God could heal you
[1:47:17] but you'd like new you know what
[1:47:19] miracles are but if God chooses to take
[1:47:21] you then you just get with your dad wait
[1:47:24] for me there okay
[1:47:26] well within a few days we had a call
[1:47:31] from a sister back in West Virginia and
[1:47:34] friend of the family and so she said you
[1:47:38] know today I was getting up from lunch
[1:47:39] and it's getting up from the table and
[1:47:42] there was a vision right there you know
[1:47:44] and she said in this vision I can see
[1:47:46] brother Brandon preaching and all these
[1:47:48] people he's preaching faith and there's
[1:47:50] prayer line everything's going on and in
[1:47:52] the midst of it he points to me yeah one
[1:47:55] dimension to the other a new little
[1:47:58] sister thank you for praying for my
[1:48:00] daughter Rebecca until George not to
[1:48:03] worry everything's gonna be okay well
[1:48:05] then you start paying attention you know
[1:48:07] and so and he said you know Hebrews 13:8
[1:48:12] is still in effect yeah well sure enough
[1:48:16] October went by November 28th the Lord
[1:48:19] called her home we have the funeral on
[1:48:21] December 4th and I remember saying Lord
[1:48:24] you see my situation keep me busy keep
[1:48:29] me balanced keep me focused so we've
[1:48:33] been very busy and trying to stay
[1:48:36] focused on the resurrection and stay
[1:48:38] balanced because there's all kinds of
[1:48:40] things to you know take off and so God
[1:48:46] knows what he's doing and you know for
[1:48:48] every one of us there's a line in the
[1:48:50] road someplace now we don't know where
[1:48:52] it is we've heard about a guy that died
[1:48:55] at 22 years old this morning that's
[1:48:57] terrible
[1:48:58] some people you know if you get the
[1:48:59] paper you know they didn't all die 96
[1:49:01] and so there's a line for each one of us
[1:49:04] you just got to stay ready you see and
[1:49:08] we won't go past that line now we were
[1:49:11] married for just over 40 years and three
[1:49:14] children got three grandchildren and we
[1:49:18] moved to several different places but
[1:49:20] the fact is that the missionary work is
[1:49:23] still going on there's a lot of work to
[1:49:26] do you know I was over in Africa a few
[1:49:29] years ago here's the church huge Church
[1:49:32] Sunday School 4700 people present
[1:49:36] that's 4700
[1:49:38] Bibles 250 oh man we gotta help these
[1:49:41] poor people you know so I was talking to
[1:49:43] the pastor he said no look you see this
[1:49:46] church we're building this church
[1:49:47] capacity 7,000 people this is with our
[1:49:51] money
[1:49:52] we have money and it's not drywall it's
[1:49:54] all over enforce concrete so there's
[1:49:56] plenty of money here he said and they
[1:49:59] sell Bibles right there these people
[1:50:01] can't read because when they're 78 years
[1:50:05] old they're already out there scratching
[1:50:06] for diamonds it's such an area you can't
[1:50:08] just buy a ticket and go there you have
[1:50:10] to have a letter invitation stamped and
[1:50:13] sealed to even buy your ticket in the
[1:50:15] first place so very interesting area
[1:50:19] well anyway so I'm preaching to these
[1:50:22] 6,000 people on Sunday because more came
[1:50:25] in you know it's kind of like here they
[1:50:26] weren't all here 7 o'clock were they and
[1:50:30] so we sold like 6,000 people and
[1:50:34] speaking through a translator and so as
[1:50:37] soon as we finished the pastor jumps up
[1:50:39] he says now wooden brother George is
[1:50:40] coming back but does anybody have any
[1:50:43] questions you can imagine so they
[1:50:47] started giving their questions and in
[1:50:49] the translation and translation of the
[1:50:50] question they were no hurry to go didn't
[1:50:53] matter if I was starving they didn't
[1:50:54] they weren't hurry and so the only
[1:50:57] question I remember this one sister
[1:51:00] passed up a question well since the Lord
[1:51:01] took your wife why you still wearing the
[1:51:03] ring they notice everything you know
[1:51:07] and so I said that's because my
[1:51:11] commitment to Rebekah wasn't until death
[1:51:13] do you part is for eternity okay okay
[1:51:17] so God is definitely keeping us busy
[1:51:20] there's a lot to do but my humble advice
[1:51:23] for you married people make her laugh at
[1:51:27] you every day
[1:51:29] just keep her happy I didn't always do
[1:51:33] it but it's the way it works and you
[1:51:36] know people are watching your life they
[1:51:39] were their watch and they see what
[1:51:40] happens you know and we see that there
[1:51:44] was people in brother Browns day that
[1:51:46] that caused him a lot of grief because
[1:51:48] they thought he was Jesus Christ and
[1:51:49] they even
[1:51:50] start baptized in his name and bunch of
[1:51:52] stuff well and we want to kind of put
[1:51:55] them down but is anybody confused you
[1:51:57] with Jesus Christ this week if they Wow
[1:52:00] there goes an angel you know so the
[1:52:04] scripture says by this shall all men
[1:52:06] know that you're my disciples it's not
[1:52:08] if you weren't across not if you got a
[1:52:10] certain belt buckle know the life and
[1:52:13] the love you have one to the other so
[1:52:15] they're watching as we have loved one of
[1:52:17] the other they know that Christ is with
[1:52:19] us now I got a friend out in in Arizona
[1:52:24] he doesn't speak very good English at
[1:52:25] all so we always communicate in Spanish
[1:52:27] but he called me one one Sunday morning
[1:52:31] or earlier it was then summertime
[1:52:33] there's three hours difference and so he
[1:52:35] was crying I said what's wrong and he
[1:52:38] said well I just woke up I had this had
[1:52:39] this dream and said in this dream I was
[1:52:42] in heaven I was talking about LeBron him
[1:52:44] we were talking sin away he doesn't
[1:52:46] speak Spanish you don't speak English
[1:52:47] yeah but we were communicating real well
[1:52:49] so it's another language some kind and
[1:52:53] so we were talking and he said that as
[1:52:59] they were talking he was noticing it
[1:53:01] right there with brother Brown was this
[1:53:03] girl you kept looking at her Wow that's
[1:53:06] Rebecca and she gave him big smile on
[1:53:08] she said you tell George I'm right where
[1:53:11] he told me to wait though it is real
[1:53:14] yeah so we'll talk more about the
[1:53:18] missionary work tomorrow maybe his Lord
[1:53:20] tarries but it's wanted to share this
[1:53:22] one quote here with you brother Roman
[1:53:24] says years ago there was a writer Fanny
[1:53:26] Crosby and she was blind and she didn't
[1:53:28] sell her birthright to the world she you
[1:53:30] know she was a different kind of woman
[1:53:32] and said they came to see her one day
[1:53:34] and they said why don't you write modern
[1:53:36] poetry and write songs for in the
[1:53:38] entertainment world and she said I give
[1:53:39] all my talent to God oh you believe that
[1:53:42] there'll be a heaven and that you're
[1:53:45] gonna be there oh yeah yeah I'm going
[1:53:47] I'll be there and he said when you get
[1:53:50] there if you're still blind
[1:53:52] how will you know him she said I'll feel
[1:53:55] the nail scars in his hands and she got
[1:53:58] up went into the other room and then
[1:54:02] when she did she raised her hands
[1:54:03] and begin to praise God and when those
[1:54:06] people have left in other words you know
[1:54:07] that mustard changed did a song struck
[1:54:09] her she said I shall know him I shall
[1:54:11] know him and redeem by his side I shall
[1:54:14] stand of course we all know the song he
[1:54:16] says and today brother sister
[1:54:18] she's walking the streets of glory with
[1:54:20] far better sight than anybody on earth
[1:54:22] ever had she sees him she knows him and
[1:54:25] is standing redeemed by his side and if
[1:54:29] I would ask her tonight Fanny Crosby
[1:54:31] what does Christ mean to you now he said
[1:54:35] she would sing this song for me
[1:54:36] something like this past me not the
[1:54:39] gentle Savior that's what he means to
[1:54:41] the believer so if the song leader can
[1:54:44] come up and help us musicians will sing
[1:54:47] that song past me not o gentle Savior
[1:54:49] and Lord bless you and we will see you
[1:54:53] back here tomorrow Lord willing

[2:02:49] Oh
[2:02:57] [Music]
[2:03:10] praise the name of the Lord you know I
[2:03:13] was preaching and some services here
[2:03:15] back in the first the other part of last
[2:03:17] year and was a brother I walked into his
[2:03:19] office and I seen this this little the
[2:03:24] picture that he had and I said man I
[2:03:26] really liked that and he said I had that
[2:03:28] made and I said man I really like that
[2:03:30] he said well you know what you can take
[2:03:32] it with you I wonder what I loved on it
[2:03:35] was is there as it said it says we don't
[2:03:38] change the message the message changes
[2:03:40] us you see we we speak of this and this
[2:03:45] terminology message seems to be a new
[2:03:48] that terminology and you know people in
[2:03:50] the world and the church will say well
[2:03:51] what do you mean about message but the
[2:03:53] reality is it's not a new message it's
[2:03:56] the same original message of Calvary
[2:03:59] it's the message of the true atonement
[2:04:02] it's not what has God all mixed up and
[2:04:04] polluted and convoluted with things but
[2:04:06] it's the same original message and that
[2:04:10] is of God's life being placed back
[2:04:14] inside the worshiper aren't you grateful
[2:04:16] to God amen that our eyes have been
[2:04:19] opened that God would bring us back into
[2:04:21] a place to where we can have a real
[2:04:24] relationship with him you know it's it's
[2:04:28] one of the things the Bible says that
[2:04:30] that in they that call upon the name of
[2:04:32] the Lord they shall be saved but how can
[2:04:34] they how can they call in whom they have
[2:04:36] not heard how can they call in whom they
[2:04:40] have not heard they they must hear first
[2:04:42] of all and to think of that that
[2:04:44] ministering of the name is not just
[2:04:46] saying the name of Jesus Christ
[2:04:47] but it's that living person his
[2:04:49] character that's his name when that
[2:04:52] comes down there's no mistaking of them
[2:04:55] something of an imagination
[2:04:57] it's his life it's him that's being
[2:05:00] introduced aren't you glad aren't you
[2:05:02] glad it's not it's not some idea of a
[2:05:05] man that we
[2:05:05] introduced - no no this this messaging
[2:05:07] is not the ideas of William Brennan this
[2:05:10] message is a message of the expressed
[2:05:13] thoughts of Jehovah that's exactly what
[2:05:16] it is
[2:05:17] amen ministering to you and I and you
[2:05:19] know what means something to you and I
[2:05:21] because we were and our thoughts of God
[2:05:24] it's not something that we can explain
[2:05:26] we can't explain why we believe it oh
[2:05:28] well you know by the salmon I believe it
[2:05:30] because I've read it and this makes
[2:05:31] sense that's all intellectual that's all
[2:05:34] intellectual God doesn't make sense I'll
[2:05:39] just put it to you like that it's not
[2:05:41] something that makes sense we don't
[2:05:43] become believers because it makes sense
[2:05:44] there's a necessary step but we are
[2:05:47] believers true believers when we have
[2:05:50] been born of the supernatural that's
[2:05:54] where it becomes a living reality within
[2:05:56] us aren't you grateful you know the
[2:05:59] Bible says in mark chapter 16 I'm not
[2:06:01] gonna preach but in mark 16 it says he
[2:06:04] that believeth and is baptized shall be
[2:06:07] saved but you know that baptize there is
[2:06:09] not just talking about water baptism in
[2:06:11] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that's
[2:06:13] the same word that's used when my candor
[2:06:16] would use it when it says by one spirit
[2:06:18] we are all baptized into one body
[2:06:21] that's a baptism up here there's men
[2:06:23] that can stand here and they can put you
[2:06:25] down as you submit to it but there's
[2:06:28] only one that can put you in the body by
[2:06:30] the spiritual baptism and that's
[2:06:32] Almighty God himself
[2:06:33] aren't you glad he's never too busy he's
[2:06:36] never missed one baptism he's never had
[2:06:41] the Deacons do it he's never had other
[2:06:43] men it's only him that can do this
[2:06:45] aren't you grateful for that amen the
[2:06:49] Shepherd the Prophet tells us the
[2:06:50] Shepherd is always present when they use
[2:06:53] our given birth amen don't you loving
