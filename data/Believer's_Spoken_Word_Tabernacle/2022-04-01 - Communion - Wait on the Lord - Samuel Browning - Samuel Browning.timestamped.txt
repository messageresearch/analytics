[40:51] amen
[40:53] amen if you turn with me in the bible to
[40:56] psalms 27
[40:58] i'd like to go there
[41:00] just for a few
[41:04] moments okay
[41:23] i'd like to read at verse seven
[41:25] if you go
[41:26] to that to that place
[41:30] david said here
[41:32] oh lord
[41:33] when i cry with my voice
[41:36] have mercy also upon me
[41:39] and answer me
[41:41] when thou satist seek my face
[41:44] my heart said unto thee
[41:47] thy face lord
[41:49] will i seek
[41:51] hide not thy face far from me
[41:54] put not thy servant away in anger
[41:56] thou hast been my help
[41:59] leave me not neither forsake me o god of
[42:02] my salvation
[42:04] when my father and my mother forsake me
[42:07] then the lord will take me up
[42:09] teach me
[42:11] thy way o lord and lead me in a plain
[42:14] path because of mine enemies
[42:16] deliver me not over unto the will of my
[42:19] enemies for false witnesses are risen up
[42:22] against me and such as breathe out
[42:25] cruelty
[42:26] and i had fainted unless i had believed
[42:29] to see the goodness of the lord
[42:31] in the land of the living
[42:34] mr verses i want to just draw our
[42:36] attention to this verse
[42:37] wait
[42:38] on the lord
[42:40] be of good courage
[42:42] and he shall strengthen thine heart
[42:46] wait i say
[42:48] on the lord
[42:49] amen i'd just like to speak just a few
[42:52] moments on that thought on weight
[42:54] on the lord may god bless the reading of
[42:56] the word as you're being seated
[42:59] i wonder if you also wouldn't turn with
[43:01] me i don't have it up there but if
[43:03] you'll turn with me to isaiah chapter 40
[43:07] and
[43:09] i had it in there a little bit further
[43:11] down but i'm just going to go ahead and
[43:12] read that and perhaps pick up on that
[43:14] here in isaiah chapter 40
[43:18] and verse
[43:24] verse 28. or 27.
[43:29] why sayest thou o jacob and speakest o
[43:32] israel my way is hid from the lord
[43:35] my judgment is passed over from my god
[43:38] hast thou not known
[43:40] hast thou not heard
[43:42] that the everlasting god the lord the
[43:45] creator of the ends of the earth
[43:47] fainteth not neither is weary
[43:50] there is no searching of his
[43:52] understanding he giveth power to the
[43:55] faint
[43:56] and to them that have no might he
[43:59] increaseth
[44:00] strength
[44:02] even the youths shall faint
[44:05] and be weary
[44:06] the young men shall utterly fail
[44:09] so we see even in this scripture that
[44:12] even to have
[44:13] strength of youthfulness
[44:15] is not enough to stand
[44:18] even in this hour
[44:20] there needs to be a greater strength now
[44:22] notice verse 31 we'll draw from there
[44:25] but they that wait
[44:26] upon the lord
[44:28] shall renew their strength now
[44:31] this is not a question if it will happen
[44:34] but the bible says they that wait
[44:37] on the lord
[44:38] shall renew their strength
[44:40] and you see
[44:42] god places it in such a way that you and
[44:45] i would know
[44:46] not only how
[44:48] but that to come into a place that we
[44:50] are waiting on the lord in other words
[44:52] there's a certainty
[44:54] you know it's like any of you that have
[44:55] went you've traveled on an airplane or
[44:59] maybe some of you traveled on a bus or
[45:01] you you've been in places that you know
[45:04] you need to be at this certain gate or
[45:06] this place at a certain time
[45:09] because that's where the departure or
[45:10] the flight or where this is going to be
[45:13] see god announces in his word just as
[45:16] much and that's those things we know in
[45:18] the natural
[45:19] a gate where a flight's going to take
[45:21] place anybody who's flown you flies at
[45:24] all you know that can change in a
[45:26] heartbeat you can be sitting there and
[45:28] they can move it clear to another
[45:29] terminal
[45:30] so that there's no certainty in that
[45:33] but there is a certainty in god's word
[45:36] to where when god has made a promise
[45:38] that we can wait on the lord
[45:41] and we when we wait on the lord then we
[45:43] will come
[45:44] his provided approach his way
[45:47] and when we come according to his way
[45:49] and his approach under his leading then
[45:52] it's all his working
[45:54] and so we can have a confidence god
[45:56] would lay out in his word that there's a
[45:59] certainty that we're waiting on the lord
[46:01] so let me read that in verse 31 again
[46:03] but they that wait on the lord shall
[46:06] renew their strength and they shall
[46:09] mount up with wings as eagles they shall
[46:13] run and not be weary and they shall walk
[46:17] and not faint
[46:20] so
[46:21] if we can ever look at it in a time in
[46:23] our life as we're thinking about in
[46:25] communion in prayer and in our lives as
[46:28] we walk daily with the lord if there
[46:31] ever is a time in an hour
[46:34] of a people that would be in need of a
[46:36] renewing it would truly be the people of
[46:38] god in this hour
[46:40] we we have such a precious promise from
[46:43] the word of god
[46:44] that not only is the baptism of the holy
[46:47] ghost it's one feeling but there is many
[46:50] many refillings
[46:52] and we need that we need a continual
[46:55] refilling of the holy ghost
[46:57] and so when we're looking at this
[47:00] waiting on the lord there's a certainty
[47:03] that comes from the presence of god and
[47:05] i think in a day in an age that we are
[47:08] living in we are constantly
[47:10] taxed with uh that of impatience all
[47:14] around us
[47:15] uh we want things coming and moving in
[47:18] such a quick pace it's almost like we
[47:21] can't take it when the lights are red
[47:23] and oh now it's the turn signal to go
[47:26] green and all of the things that are
[47:28] around us and you realize that things
[47:30] that are there those stop lights have
[47:33] been there for how long but the things
[47:36] that we even have around us that wants
[47:38] to further put that pressure where we
[47:40] can at the at just a few few fingers we
[47:44] can look something up and all of a
[47:46] sudden you know and then if it's not
[47:47] coming up we're looking at the
[47:52] come on come on come on come on come on
[47:54] come on come on come on
[47:56] now i know i'm not the only one that
[47:58] feels that way sometimes and you think
[48:00] oh no do i have to go you know the route
[48:02] or the or unplug this and plug this back
[48:04] up because you're expecting when you
[48:07] look something up that it's going to
[48:08] come up there but yet all of those
[48:10] things that move in such a way of of
[48:13] instant instant instant and it puts us
[48:15] in a way that sometimes we get in that
[48:18] we get in that frame framework of how
[48:21] we're looking for god to come on the
[48:23] scene and fulfill the promises of his
[48:25] word you know there's things that we can
[48:28] we can look at and say well this is the
[48:30] time or this is the moment but god holds
[48:33] every season in his hand
[48:36] god holds that in his hand and even the
[48:38] season of when god will give an answer
[48:41] to the promises that he has given and
[48:44] made to us i want to read this this
[48:47] quote here tonight
[48:49] i'll refer to others but i want to read
[48:50] this and brother branham is talking
[48:52] about of communion and this is out of
[48:55] the message remembering the lord he says
[48:57] one of many times i've wondered if that
[48:59] when we use the if we don't use the word
[49:02] just right of communion commune means to
[49:05] talk to to commune with and i wonder if
[49:08] really when we meet together like this
[49:10] in heavenly places if that isn't if if
[49:13] that isn't communion that we are
[49:15] communing with god and talking to him
[49:19] now if you remember things that we even
[49:21] had spoke on before where brother adam
[49:23] will say in the same year he'll speak of
[49:26] even when you come to listen to a
[49:28] minister giving his message you're not
[49:30] communing with that minister but when we
[49:32] come to the house of god
[49:34] we're here to commune with god but our
[49:37] communion is not limited to here
[49:40] but we are here to
[49:42] the petitions and the desires that we
[49:45] have were here that god would minister
[49:48] to the very needs of our life we're here
[49:51] in a place to be sensitive to hear from
[49:54] god and you know think of god in his
[49:57] mercy when brother branham would stand
[49:59] there on the platform and he could see a
[50:01] person they were getting ready to miss
[50:03] what god was actually speaking to them
[50:07] and he said oh god help me help me lord
[50:10] give me their name lest they miss that
[50:13] you are speaking to them see sometimes
[50:15] it's in a place notice the grace of god
[50:18] that god would call that person's name
[50:21] out setting in the audience so that they
[50:23] might recognize that god what he's
[50:25] speaking to it's them personally and
[50:28] when we come to set here we come to
[50:30] commune with god there's questions
[50:33] there's needs there's desires there are
[50:35] and all of it has to do with the
[50:37] promises that god has made concerning
[50:41] our lives what he's given in his word
[50:43] and we're here to commune with him we're
[50:45] here to to have fellowship we're here to
[50:48] hear from almighty god
[50:50] and so when we look at this brother man
[50:52] goes on and he says he says if we would
[50:55] just sit still and let him answer us
[50:58] back and he said many things many things
[51:01] one of the horrible things that i do i
[51:04] try to do all the talking
[51:06] and not sit still long enough for him to
[51:08] answer me back and we do that so many
[51:12] times in prayer
[51:15] that what's our voice we're the ones
[51:17] talking now notice what he says here i
[51:19] think if we would get off of our heart
[51:22] what's in it
[51:24] and express ourselves to the lord jesus
[51:27] and then just kneel
[51:29] and just be still a while and just see
[51:31] what he would say
[51:34] back to us
[51:35] because
[51:36] prayer is communion remember as we've
[51:38] been looking at entering in to
[51:40] fellowship with god and coming into that
[51:43] place of communion because ultimately
[51:46] it's god's desire true fellowship is
[51:50] under the blood of jesus christ where
[51:53] that life has come back upon us and
[51:55] there has been a transformation and the
[51:58] communion is not somewhere out there but
[52:01] it has now come into that place in the
[52:03] very soul of man where god can speak to
[52:07] that life god can commune with our lives
[52:10] think of it adam in the beginning could
[52:12] not have fellowship with the monkeys he
[52:14] couldn't have fellowship with the
[52:16] elephants adam could only have
[52:18] fellowship with one of his kind
[52:21] and god can only disclose his heart his
[52:24] secrets to his bride
[52:27] because nobody else would want to know
[52:29] those things but he discloses his heart
[52:33] to those who have a desire to know him
[52:36] to walk with him to please him and god
[52:40] unfolds himself to the believer and
[52:42] there is a union between the believer
[52:45] and christ to where we're no longer
[52:47] twain but we are one
[52:50] and there's a restoring of that
[52:52] communion which is the fellowship inside
[52:55] of man
[52:57] now when we so when we're looking at jew
[52:59] to just be still for a while and and we
[53:02] can all say amen to this that we are in
[53:05] a time of busyness or it can be busy and
[53:09] life can become so busy and you become
[53:12] so occupied and to where even when you
[53:14] have your moments and your time you feel
[53:18] i'm just wore out i'm just depleted
[53:21] is that right
[53:23] and whether it's physically or mentally
[53:25] there is a lot there's a lot of pressure
[53:27] and even from the toils and tasks of
[53:30] life to where that within it that it
[53:33] would cause us to to just you know move
[53:36] around ever so quickly but notice the
[53:39] scripture and i always when i i think of
[53:41] the scripture here in james 1 where the
[53:44] scripture says let every man be swift to
[53:48] hear
[53:49] i always think of what brother john
[53:50] lafontaine always spoke he said god gave
[53:53] you two ears and one mouth not two mouth
[53:56] and one ear
[53:58] god gave us that for a reason to be
[54:00] swift to hear so hearing
[54:03] is to be before the speaking and to know
[54:06] that how that god would so so arrange
[54:09] that that so many times for us to listen
[54:11] and that scripture goes on to say slow
[54:13] to peak slow to speak slow to wrath for
[54:16] the wrath of man worketh not the
[54:17] righteousness of god every one of us
[54:20] here no doubt at some time have tried to
[54:22] finish our wife's statement or our
[54:24] husband's statement we know exactly
[54:26] where they're going
[54:28] and yet we don't
[54:30] i wasn't going there i wasn't going in
[54:33] that direction but we're so quick to go
[54:35] this way or i think i
[54:37] and everything we're so quick to respond
[54:40] to something when that is totally
[54:42] contrary to the things of god it is true
[54:46] we are to be as the bible would say quit
[54:48] quit be strong like man but that means
[54:51] to stand resolute with faith upon god's
[54:54] promise not to act in haste
[54:57] there's times of haste where we move on
[54:59] the promise of god god has made this
[55:01] promise and we take it but yet there are
[55:03] there are the times in our life as the
[55:06] scriptures so many would say wait on the
[55:08] lord that it's not in our in our
[55:11] interest or in god's desire that we
[55:13] would move so hastily to where we're
[55:16] moving without real solid authority
[55:21] notice brother branham was speaking in
[55:22] this same same quote about about being
[55:25] in prayer for things in our lives
[55:28] he said sometimes he's speaking of what
[55:30] we just read there if we would just
[55:32] kneel and be still for a while sometimes
[55:34] he says i've done that
[55:36] and my whole opinion
[55:38] was changed
[55:40] see one thing i love about brother
[55:41] branham he's very honest he's very
[55:43] transparent
[55:44] he doesn't say i've always done that
[55:47] he just said it in the quote above one
[55:49] of the horriblest things i do
[55:51] come on friends
[55:53] and even right here he says and
[55:54] sometimes i've done that because there's
[55:56] also the pressures of life that come
[55:59] just stick with me sometimes i've done
[56:02] that and my whole opinion has changed
[56:06] i'd go ask him something now lord these
[56:09] people really they got something i i
[56:11] believe they want me over here and i
[56:13] just start praying and first thing you
[56:16] know i'm just satisfied that that's the
[56:18] lord's will
[56:20] but after i pray
[56:21] if i just linger a little while
[56:24] then it's changed
[56:26] my
[56:28] but how many times after that
[56:30] well yeah
[56:31] i just started praying and i just feel
[56:33] like it's god's will
[56:35] praise god get the bags packed can't
[56:37] call the mortgage come all these things
[56:39] and yet we haven't lingered to see what
[56:42] does god say about it
[56:44] we're living in a world which always has
[56:47] been where man has went by feelings the
[56:49] fall took place because of what satan
[56:52] was able to project to eve a word that
[56:55] was contrary to the word of god and
[56:57] remember how brother rabbi spoke of it
[56:59] he touched her he began to speak to her
[57:01] and her mind imagination come everything
[57:04] was moved by feelings and feeling
[57:07] there's nothing wrong with feelings but
[57:08] the church of the living god does not
[57:10] walk by feelings we walk by faith
[57:16] not feelings
[57:18] because sometimes our feelings
[57:20] we have to always check our feelings
[57:23] and one of the ways that the prophet is
[57:25] laying this out right here is to check
[57:27] that that after he's prayed and my just
[57:30] such a no doubt a wonderful atmosphere
[57:33] but he's lingered a little bit
[57:35] because that lingering is speaking to
[57:37] god lord what do you say about this
[57:40] i'm leaning this way but what do you say
[57:43] about it
[57:44] you see all together he says sometimes
[57:47] somewhere else just commune with the
[57:49] lord and oh what a glorious fellowship
[57:52] just to get get down and talk and
[57:54] commune and wait for him to talk back
[57:59] how many say help me lord
[58:02] help me lord and wait for him to talk
[58:04] back
[58:05] absolutely wait for him to talk back
[58:08] and to think notice brother brown goes
[58:10] on to say this and to think of what a
[58:12] great person that is you're talking to
[58:15] that that's a powerful statement what a
[58:17] great person that you're talking to
[58:20] we're talking to the king of kings and
[58:22] the lord of lords
[58:24] there there's there's no such thing as a
[58:26] secretary in heaven this isn't the
[58:28] second man in charge this is god himself
[58:32] great person that we would have an
[58:35] audience with a privilege that even he
[58:37] would speak to us and say ask
[58:40] ask
[58:41] an opening ask ask ask
[58:45] and think what a great person that is
[58:47] you're talking to the creator himself
[58:49] and communing with him who put your life
[58:52] in this volcanic ash that you're living
[58:54] in and then someday you'll have to leave
[58:57] there and then it's in his hands where
[58:59] it goes from there you have the
[59:01] privilege now to make your choice which
[59:04] way that soul goes when it leaves and
[59:07] what a wonderful thing to commune with
[59:09] him upon the basis of his promises then
[59:13] hear him commune back to you and say
[59:15] it's all well
[59:17] that really expresses it right we don't
[59:19] have to look to a creed we're not
[59:21] looking to dogmas only thing we have to
[59:24] do is just know that he witnesses back
[59:26] his word and it's settled then the
[59:29] burdens roll away
[59:30] i think that that's this is i read this
[59:33] right here and it just suppresses upon
[59:35] my heart to think of it when we are
[59:38] communing with god wait on the lord and
[59:40] be of good courage when god makes known
[59:43] his promise to our life personally we've
[59:46] got assurance that we can wait and have
[59:48] an expectation on god to come and
[59:51] fulfill that promise we can commune with
[59:54] him on the basis of his promise
[59:57] you realize brother graham says that has
[59:58] a life you know a life can try to quit
[1:00:01] drinking or quit smoking and brother
[1:00:02] branham he just says it so plainly in a
[1:00:05] manner he says with all those things he
[1:00:07] said you must believe the whole thing
[1:00:11] lays in faith he that heareth my words
[1:00:14] believeth on him that sent me hath
[1:00:16] everlasting life and shall not come into
[1:00:18] condemnation but has already passed from
[1:00:20] death unto life he said do you believe
[1:00:23] that's the truth there isn't nothing
[1:00:25] else that you can do but only believe
[1:00:28] and if you believe then the little
[1:00:31] immoral things will drop off
[1:00:33] as you believe you become
[1:00:36] love
[1:00:38] and love is god and you begin to wind
[1:00:41] yourself into christ and these other
[1:00:44] things you don't have to quit doing them
[1:00:46] they just quit themselves because
[1:00:50] there's no more desire to do it
[1:00:53] you wind yourself into him you're
[1:00:55] becoming love see you're fellowshipping
[1:00:58] upon the promises of god the promise
[1:01:00] that god has made in this hour let's
[1:01:03] take back in luther's day they could
[1:01:05] commune with god upon the promise of
[1:01:08] that just shall live by faith
[1:01:10] in wesley's day commune with the blood
[1:01:12] that sanctifies in that of pentecost
[1:01:15] they could commune with the promise of
[1:01:18] to think of the restoration of the gifts
[1:01:20] the coming of the holy spirit to think
[1:01:22] at this hour you and i are communing and
[1:01:25] can commune with god upon that promise
[1:01:28] of the holy ghost on the seal of the
[1:01:30] living god you see god has made promises
[1:01:34] to you and i and made them so real that
[1:01:37] we can commune and talk to god about
[1:01:39] these things
[1:01:41] we're communing with god about the
[1:01:43] promise of the rapture
[1:01:45] even so come lord jesus
[1:01:48] there's a communion going on there's a
[1:01:50] back and forth what god is disclosing
[1:01:53] but it's on the basis of his promise and
[1:01:55] notice all of these bases as we speak of
[1:01:58] as you're communing with him and upon
[1:02:01] the basis of his word what god is
[1:02:03] speaking to your heart no matter where
[1:02:05] you're at here tonight
[1:02:06] there is a communion that can take place
[1:02:09] and god's desire is for it to move down
[1:02:11] into the very depths of your life if
[1:02:13] it's not there yet
[1:02:15] are you hearing me there's a word that
[1:02:18] god has given you can commune upon the
[1:02:20] basis of his promise the basis is coming
[1:02:23] under the blood as the word is speaking
[1:02:25] to us us surrendering and us looking to
[1:02:28] god and praying over these things and i
[1:02:30] just it just kind of keeps on coming
[1:02:32] back around if you don't commune upon
[1:02:35] the basis of the promises you won't go
[1:02:37] nowhere
[1:02:40] you've got to commune upon the basis of
[1:02:42] his promises
[1:02:44] not just come to the house of god and
[1:02:46] say my that was a wonderful touch but
[1:02:48] that touch should stimulate you to
[1:02:50] commune on the basis of the promises of
[1:02:53] almighty god and look for and answer
[1:02:56] god's witness to come back upon your
[1:02:59] life
[1:03:00] because as you commune on it and be
[1:03:02] honest with him there's things in your
[1:03:04] life sin and habits and unbelief he will
[1:03:07] dissolve those things he will clean it
[1:03:10] out as you will commune with him upon
[1:03:12] the promise
[1:03:14] i think it's fitting because we look in
[1:03:16] the scripture
[1:03:18] the bible would say in the book of
[1:03:20] hebrews chapter 10 verse 35 cast not
[1:03:23] away therefore your confidence which
[1:03:26] hath great recompense of reward for you
[1:03:29] have need of patience
[1:03:32] that after you have done the will of god
[1:03:34] you might receive the promise for yet a
[1:03:37] little while and he that shall come will
[1:03:40] come and will not terry
[1:03:44] you know think about when we're looking
[1:03:46] at patients and that's a that's a great
[1:03:48] that's a great big one right there
[1:03:51] you think about patience think about
[1:03:53] time and talking
[1:03:56] you know in your home and every
[1:03:58] everybody has you know like i said time
[1:04:00] things sometimes things could be crunch
[1:04:02] time or whatever more but can you
[1:04:04] imagine
[1:04:05] and let's just take
[1:04:07] talking to the lord
[1:04:08] and put it in a manner as like we would
[1:04:10] talk to our spouse or our children
[1:04:12] and say you know what
[1:04:14] okay i've got about 10 minutes here and
[1:04:17] so come on
[1:04:18] come on just just cut cut to the chase
[1:04:20] let's go stop i don't need all the
[1:04:21] background just cut to the chase on this
[1:04:24] wow
[1:04:26] you would find you know you know what
[1:04:28] you would find
[1:04:29] never mind we'll talk about it later
[1:04:32] right
[1:04:33] all right she's not interested
[1:04:37] it wouldn't he wouldn't go anywhere
[1:04:39] and see
[1:04:40] it's not something that we say sometimes
[1:04:43] you don't have to say it it's demeanor
[1:04:44] of your body but think about it to god
[1:04:47] that god can speak and know even within
[1:04:50] our spirit of where we're at and you
[1:04:52] know here we're stirred and you know the
[1:04:54] first thing to do is you know what lord
[1:04:56] i just need to get settled i just need
[1:04:58] to get quiet sometimes we're wanting an
[1:05:00] answer and we look like a troubled sea
[1:05:04] and we're wanting god to sit down on a
[1:05:06] troubled sea and sometimes we're
[1:05:07] thinking well if i go to put on music or
[1:05:10] if i do this that's going to take time
[1:05:12] but that very moment of conditioning our
[1:05:14] heart to come into a place of communion
[1:05:17] to where you could spend 40 minutes and
[1:05:19] the sea is just bubbling and shaking or
[1:05:22] you can take that time and let your
[1:05:24] spirit get set alright and begin to
[1:05:27] think about him and just worship him and
[1:05:29] invite him to come and in just a few
[1:05:32] moments of time that right there is real
[1:05:35] communion with him
[1:05:40] so we don't want to put god on a
[1:05:42] schedule
[1:05:44] lord you can talk to me but you've got
[1:05:46] to fit it in in this time
[1:05:48] but you see this is the blessedness of
[1:05:50] community because communion itself to a
[1:05:52] believer
[1:05:54] when we have come back into fellowship
[1:05:56] with god it is not something that's
[1:05:58] reserved to just a thursday night a
[1:06:00] sunday morning or a designated time in a
[1:06:04] prayer closet
[1:06:05] but in we become available or should
[1:06:09] allow ourselves and to be available that
[1:06:12] at any moment that he desires to speak
[1:06:15] to us that he's welcome he's able to
[1:06:18] come and to speak to us that's the
[1:06:20] fulfillment of praying without ceasing
[1:06:24] it's not just confined to just
[1:06:27] like traditional moments
[1:06:29] but when we look at it think of one of
[1:06:31] these ways because i could say for
[1:06:33] everybody here we've all prayed
[1:06:36] and we've waited for answers
[1:06:39] let me just say it to you like this
[1:06:41] sometimes waiting on your knees
[1:06:43] you could wait there
[1:06:45] and you might wait to the early morning
[1:06:47] hours
[1:06:48] and you've not got no answer
[1:06:51] you see communion is is where you're in
[1:06:53] a place to where god is able to answer
[1:06:58] in whatever manner he chooses
[1:07:01] it's to become sensitive to his voice
[1:07:05] now watch how brother branham takes this
[1:07:07] because you're in prayer and he talks
[1:07:09] about simeon we know that simeon here
[1:07:12] was the bible says he was a devout man
[1:07:14] and he was waiting
[1:07:16] for the consolation of israel and the
[1:07:18] holy ghost was upon him
[1:07:21] he was waiting
[1:07:22] and brother branham puts it brother puts
[1:07:24] it in this manner this is a way to
[1:07:26] approach this he's saying simeon who is
[1:07:29] our character tonight
[1:07:31] something just told him to sit down a
[1:07:34] little while
[1:07:37] just sit down a little while
[1:07:39] and he says you know brother ramsay says
[1:07:40] we are going so fast sometimes we ought
[1:07:43] to set down just a little while
[1:07:47] phones aside
[1:07:48] ipads aside
[1:07:51] hello
[1:07:52] just sit down for a little while we
[1:07:55] ought to sit down we run and say a
[1:07:58] little prayer for me mama papa children
[1:08:00] jump up right quick and we don't stay
[1:08:02] down there long enough for god to talk
[1:08:04] back to us we do all the talking and we
[1:08:07] don't give god a chance to talk
[1:08:11] somebody called somebody was talking
[1:08:13] one time and they were you know
[1:08:16] it wasn't anybody here so don't nobody
[1:08:17] go looking around but somebody told i
[1:08:19] never heard this term given to anybody
[1:08:20] but you know they were talking about you
[1:08:22] know this one that one they said yeah
[1:08:23] when you're when you fellowship with
[1:08:25] them they ain't fellowship it's
[1:08:26] domination they just dominate the
[1:08:28] conversation so they call dominators
[1:08:31] come on
[1:08:32] [Laughter]
[1:08:34] he just dominated man they got the floor
[1:08:36] uh-huh wow wow my yeah
[1:08:40] yeah well
[1:08:41] i wonder sometimes if we don't do that
[1:08:43] to god
[1:08:45] we dominate the camera i got to get this
[1:08:47] out i got to get that out i forgot to
[1:08:48] pray about this and there are so many
[1:08:50] needs and requests to pray about let
[1:08:53] alone looking in our own lives
[1:08:56] but like brother graham said if we could
[1:08:57] just get what's on our heart get it out
[1:09:01] and then just sit still
[1:09:03] instead of looking at prayer as though
[1:09:05] it's something that of like a list and
[1:09:07] i've got to get through this and if i
[1:09:09] don't get through this if i don't pray
[1:09:11] for brother bill or i don't pray for
[1:09:12] brother brian or i don't pray for
[1:09:14] so-and-so and this mean if i if i don't
[1:09:16] do that listen we are a
[1:09:18] body let me tell you something if i had
[1:09:21] every need i'd have to write it down on
[1:09:22] a notepad
[1:09:24] but there are times those needs listen i
[1:09:27] hope you don't get offended they don't
[1:09:28] come up right before me when i'm in
[1:09:30] prayer there's other needs that come up
[1:09:32] what do you do i go right to that need
[1:09:34] and i begin to pray to that need that
[1:09:37] drops in my heart because what i've
[1:09:39] learned is that not only when i'm on my
[1:09:41] knees or laying on my face there in my
[1:09:43] office i've learned that god will speak
[1:09:45] to me on the roadways or maybe i'm in
[1:09:47] the store and another need comes up i
[1:09:50] pray for it right there because right
[1:09:52] there is where it drops in my heart
[1:09:56] hallelujah
[1:09:59] oh glory be to god
[1:10:02] notice he says we do all the talking and
[1:10:04] we don't give god a chance to talk
[1:10:08] i want you to watch how brother brown
[1:10:09] has expressed this with simeon i love
[1:10:11] this
[1:10:12] he said simeon just waited and he sat
[1:10:14] down in one of those priest office and
[1:10:16] he closed the door and locked himself in
[1:10:18] he said all of a sudden he said i can
[1:10:20] see simeon reach and pick up the
[1:10:22] scripture
[1:10:23] the brotherhood said you know the holy
[1:10:25] spirit feeds
[1:10:27] on the word of god
[1:10:29] that man shall not live by bread alone
[1:10:30] but by every word that proceeds out of
[1:10:32] the mouth of god he said that's what's a
[1:10:34] matter with the church that's what makes
[1:10:36] the church in its anemic condition is
[1:10:39] because it doesn't take time to feed on
[1:10:42] the word of god the church is hungry
[1:10:46] so to feed on now feeding is much
[1:10:48] different than listening but feeding is
[1:10:50] where you're taking it in and just
[1:10:52] laying yourself open before the word of
[1:10:54] god and allowing god just to speak to
[1:10:57] your life you know you might be walking
[1:10:59] around you might be exercising you might
[1:11:01] be doing other things you might sit
[1:11:02] right in front of of you know while
[1:11:04] that's being played but the main thing
[1:11:06] is is that you're feeding on the word of
[1:11:08] god say brother samuel what are you
[1:11:10] saying i'm saying don't let it be a
[1:11:11] religion that i've got to listen to one
[1:11:13] message a day that's religion
[1:11:17] be a feeder on the word
[1:11:20] because you could listen to it and be a
[1:11:21] critic of everybody else but if you feed
[1:11:24] on it that word changes you
[1:11:28] we're taking because notice an anemic
[1:11:31] condition is a lack of blood
[1:11:34] like i was talking to a brother the
[1:11:35] other day and he was talking about you
[1:11:37] know it doesn't go here but another
[1:11:38] minister in another place and he's
[1:11:40] talking about how that you know they
[1:11:41] were having you know he says i don't
[1:11:43] even crave chicken no more he said i
[1:11:45] don't crave it no more he said the only
[1:11:46] thing he said i'll crave his beef i said
[1:11:48] you know why you're craving that because
[1:11:50] you're low in iron
[1:11:53] you can eat chicken all day long but
[1:11:54] chicken don't have the iron to put into
[1:11:56] you you got to eat red meat
[1:11:59] well i feel like a steak right now
[1:12:02] all right chicken chicken chicken
[1:12:03] chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken
[1:12:04] chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken
[1:12:06] but you got to eat red meat
[1:12:11] put more on the menu honey
[1:12:14] or answer and it's an anemic condition
[1:12:16] it's got to be the living word of god to
[1:12:19] feed on that word
[1:12:21] to feast on it to pray over it to
[1:12:23] commune with god of the things that we
[1:12:26] are hearing and that we are receiving
[1:12:28] brother graham said you went to a doctor
[1:12:29] and that doctor you know looking at this
[1:12:31] big old stout looking man and said sir
[1:12:33] i'm sick he said well what's your
[1:12:35] symptoms well he said i'm just so weak i
[1:12:37] can't hardly pick my hands up he would
[1:12:39] ask him some some of the conditions and
[1:12:41] he would begin to say are you eating
[1:12:43] regular well i eat a half a cracker day
[1:12:45] before yesterday you're just hungry you
[1:12:48] need strength and you need to eat
[1:12:52] he said that's what's a matter with the
[1:12:53] church we just read a scripture a little
[1:12:55] verse on sunday morning and we ought to
[1:12:58] have our head in this word every minute
[1:13:01] we have to spare take a lot of times and
[1:13:03] laying something else aside to read that
[1:13:06] word you see laying something else aside
[1:13:09] there's always something to be put in
[1:13:11] its place
[1:13:13] is that right i mean you know you don't
[1:13:16] have to look around your house or your
[1:13:17] life to try to find things to do
[1:13:21] right it's always like saying i'm not
[1:13:22] going to do this this week that'll be
[1:13:24] next week
[1:13:25] and when i get the next week i'll make
[1:13:27] sure i moved it to the following week
[1:13:29] you just change the date on your
[1:13:30] reminders and it automatically kicks it
[1:13:32] down
[1:13:33] but you see there's always something
[1:13:35] there to try to take its place
[1:13:37] this is where as simeon in that moment
[1:13:41] as brother brown would dramatize that he
[1:13:43] set steel
[1:13:44] and he picked up a scroll brother bram
[1:13:46] said he began to pick up isaiah 9 and 6
[1:13:49] and he began to read over that scroll
[1:13:52] that was a promise that god even had
[1:13:55] revealed thou shalt not die until that
[1:13:58] seed the lord's christ see what's he
[1:13:59] doing as he's being sensitive now he's
[1:14:02] feeding upon the promise that has
[1:14:05] already been revealed to him and as he's
[1:14:07] feeding upon that promise at about that
[1:14:10] time brother braham said the holy spirit
[1:14:12] spoke to him and said stand up get up
[1:14:14] out of your seat open the door and walk
[1:14:17] on out there where i'm going to lead you
[1:14:19] you see he received an answer he was
[1:14:22] looking to god he was praying he was
[1:14:24] waiting on god what was he praying about
[1:14:27] he was praying about what had already
[1:14:30] been revealed to him
[1:14:31] he wasn't praying oh i hope i don't miss
[1:14:34] it oh i hope i don't miss it when he
[1:14:35] comes oh no no that's not how he's
[1:14:37] praying wait on the lord be of a good
[1:14:40] courage and he will strengthen thine
[1:14:43] heart he was not praying in a manner of
[1:14:45] oh i might miss it i don't know that's
[1:14:47] uncertainty he's praying god has
[1:14:50] revealed this to me what did prayer do
[1:14:53] prayer keeps him in an atmosphere of
[1:14:56] contact with god to where god can say at
[1:14:58] any time stand up and walk out there
[1:15:00] because prayer is nevertheless not my
[1:15:03] will thine will be done
[1:15:08] glory be to god thou will be done on
[1:15:10] earth even as it is
[1:15:12] in heaven
[1:15:14] now notice in this scripture that we've
[1:15:16] referred to many many times out of
[1:15:19] matthew 6
[1:15:21] when thou prayest enter into that closet
[1:15:24] and when thou shut the door pray to the
[1:15:26] father which is in secret and thy father
[1:15:29] which seeth in secret
[1:15:31] shall reward thee openly
[1:15:34] the bible would say in james 4 7-8
[1:15:37] submit yourselves therefore to god
[1:15:39] resist the devil and he will flee from
[1:15:42] you
[1:15:44] draw nigh to god and he will draw nigh
[1:15:47] to you cleanse your hands you sinners
[1:15:49] and purify your hearts you double-minded
[1:15:51] so the promise is draw not to god and he
[1:15:55] will draw nigh
[1:15:56] unto us
[1:15:58] now when you you consider even the the
[1:16:01] promises of the word of god we recognize
[1:16:05] that we can so close the door
[1:16:08] to where that your meditation and
[1:16:10] everything it becomes on the things of
[1:16:13] god
[1:16:14] now you know we would love i would love
[1:16:16] to think i you know i've been in times
[1:16:18] where
[1:16:19] meditation because meditation is part of
[1:16:22] prayer as well
[1:16:23] to where it's just it's just moved then
[1:16:26] throughout the day that no matter then
[1:16:28] where where i'm going it's just just how
[1:16:30] things just continue to drop and just
[1:16:32] communing with god and there's always
[1:16:35] then there's times and moments and
[1:16:37] things and you know you want to so guard
[1:16:39] that because you don't want that channel
[1:16:41] broken
[1:16:42] but then there's times when there's
[1:16:43] things you got to deal with in life that
[1:16:45] comes up and the channel it can be a
[1:16:48] little interrupted but it is but it
[1:16:50] isn't stopped up
[1:16:52] you come into a place and how god is
[1:16:54] able to move right back down and speak
[1:16:56] right to your heart but it's an
[1:16:58] opportunity it's a blessed time and an
[1:17:01] opportunity having fellowship with
[1:17:03] almighty god
[1:17:05] that god would speak to us and speak to
[1:17:08] us about his word the things that we're
[1:17:10] hearing even as god is ministering the
[1:17:12] things we're hearing in the message as
[1:17:14] we're taking them in and just just
[1:17:17] meditating on those things praying about
[1:17:19] those things like with simeon there when
[1:17:22] simeon himself he he picked up that of
[1:17:24] isaiah 9 6 and brother brown said here
[1:17:26] was he here's what came out of simeon oh
[1:17:29] i wonder who he could be talking about
[1:17:31] in isaiah 9 and 6. you see there was a
[1:17:34] relationship it wasn't just print he was
[1:17:37] communing
[1:17:38] it was meditating there's things that
[1:17:40] god says in in a way that would open you
[1:17:43] and i out to where that we're able and
[1:17:45] we would sit there and just take in what
[1:17:48] god is saying
[1:17:50] think of these scriptures here i i'm
[1:17:53] going to just refer to these scriptures
[1:17:55] here very quickly we've we've talked
[1:17:57] about them quite quite a bit and there's
[1:17:59] more to be said about them but think of
[1:18:01] just just when's the last time
[1:18:03] that we've
[1:18:05] just sat down
[1:18:07] just to listen to a message
[1:18:11] i mean i i can answer that but i'm
[1:18:12] talking about just to sit down just to
[1:18:14] just to just to listen
[1:18:17] just to pray
[1:18:19] let me just say it like this in our
[1:18:21] homes i can speak to parents those are
[1:18:23] coming up and so forth
[1:18:25] don't let the voice
[1:18:27] of the prophet be a foreign thing in
[1:18:29] your home
[1:18:31] brother samuel i listen to the message
[1:18:33] but let that i can tell you right now
[1:18:35] when there was a youth meeting here
[1:18:37] about back it was back in november and i
[1:18:39] took it we took a little thought and i
[1:18:41] just i played i played exactly what i
[1:18:43] was dealing with on choices and
[1:18:45] decisions and i played a clip from souls
[1:18:47] in prison now
[1:18:49] of how the prophet they're going to hell
[1:18:52] and that vision of hell and i played
[1:18:54] that i'm telling you there was an
[1:18:56] anointing came in to that living room
[1:19:00] we had service that night it didn't stop
[1:19:02] even after everybody left
[1:19:04] we had service right there that night
[1:19:07] you say brother samuel what are you
[1:19:08] saying there is an anointing upon the
[1:19:11] word of god
[1:19:13] it should not be a foreign thing you say
[1:19:16] are you telling me to be purposeful i'm
[1:19:18] telling you that if we let every other
[1:19:20] thing go on and things be played in our
[1:19:22] house it ought to be that the voice of
[1:19:24] the prophet of god should not be a
[1:19:27] foreign substance in our house
[1:19:29] you ought to be a conscious effort
[1:19:31] because listen we are under the effect
[1:19:34] not of a kentuckian's voice we're under
[1:19:37] the influence of the voice of almighty
[1:19:40] god in this hour
[1:19:42] amen we need to give that priority we
[1:19:45] need to have that time
[1:19:47] is that right
[1:19:48] we must just just set back and just
[1:19:50] behold
[1:19:51] just behold the bible says that the lord
[1:19:54] is that spirit and we are changed from
[1:19:57] glory unto glory even as by the spirit
[1:20:00] though as we are beholding in a glass as
[1:20:02] we're looking in and taking into account
[1:20:05] of our own lives there's a changing
[1:20:07] that's going on as we're yielding to him
[1:20:10] that's a communing
[1:20:12] that's a communing that's going on
[1:20:16] this is why even the scripture and i
[1:20:18] just referred to this over the months
[1:20:20] out of psalms 27 4 of what david's
[1:20:23] speaking that he had desired and the one
[1:20:25] the thing that david said that he would
[1:20:27] do is to behold the beauty of the lord
[1:20:30] and to inquire in his temple
[1:20:33] now in these scriptures alone
[1:20:35] it requires us
[1:20:38] being still
[1:20:41] it requires us being still
[1:20:44] it requires us looking into now
[1:20:47] understand what i'm saying by still i'm
[1:20:49] talking about being still in here
[1:20:52] laying aside all the things of the
[1:20:54] busyness and things that god help me
[1:20:57] help me with everything that we have
[1:20:59] going on
[1:21:01] and i know i'm speaking right down where
[1:21:02] we live tonight
[1:21:04] because there's this because with life
[1:21:06] itself whether we like it there's more
[1:21:08] responsibilities that come
[1:21:11] everything within life life itself is of
[1:21:14] responsibility
[1:21:15] and to just be able to step back and
[1:21:18] just to just to really just to take
[1:21:20] account let the word of god just speak
[1:21:22] into our lives not just here in church
[1:21:25] but outside a church
[1:21:28] mom dad you need to be in the message
[1:21:31] well brother samuel i you know listen
[1:21:33] there's no excuse we can have you have
[1:21:35] it right on your phone
[1:21:37] and you see you can say well i don't
[1:21:38] understand everything but don't let that
[1:21:41] don't let the enemy give you that excuse
[1:21:43] just get into the message put it on
[1:21:45] listen to listen to what god has spoke
[1:21:48] to us in this hour allow it to change
[1:21:50] your life i'm not speaking of something
[1:21:52] i'm not i don't know about when god got
[1:21:54] a hold of my life i laid in that message
[1:21:58] i put on tape after tape after tape did
[1:22:02] i understand everything no
[1:22:05] but it was life that was in there
[1:22:08] i just availed myself put it on put it
[1:22:11] on put it on put it on put it on in the
[1:22:13] car i kept putting it on avail myself
[1:22:16] because and there was something there
[1:22:18] was a hunger a desire for the word of
[1:22:21] god
[1:22:23] and you're feeding on that word it
[1:22:25] brings change there's relationship
[1:22:27] there's communion that takes place
[1:22:29] there's things to pray about
[1:22:35] my much much more that we can say within
[1:22:37] that but just
[1:22:39] our life
[1:22:41] you know we can
[1:22:42] this isn't us trying to do things
[1:22:45] but it's but it's our lives yielded to
[1:22:48] god
[1:22:50] it's our lives being yielded to god
[1:22:51] being open to the lord being yielded to
[1:22:54] his life in his presence he will bring
[1:22:57] the promise to pass
[1:22:59] if we'll yield ourselves to him
[1:23:03] see this is this is where
[1:23:05] brother brown could say
[1:23:07] if you'll just stay close to god
[1:23:09] just love him just live for him live a
[1:23:11] pure holy life live and pray every day
[1:23:14] keep yourself
[1:23:16] refreshed
[1:23:18] in his presence and god will take care
[1:23:22] of the rest of it
[1:23:24] it's staying refreshed in his presence
[1:23:27] remember the scripture
[1:23:29] i'm coming down here
[1:23:32] when aaron's rod was taken
[1:23:36] and placed into the whole list of homies
[1:23:41] it's when it got into the presence of
[1:23:44] almighty god
[1:23:46] that what it was all along
[1:23:49] become
[1:23:51] manifest
[1:23:53] it was an almond branch the whole time
[1:23:58] but when he got into the presence of god
[1:24:00] you see going in there
[1:24:02] would dissolve all doubts
[1:24:05] it would end every dispute
[1:24:07] it would it would it would quench
[1:24:10] every battle
[1:24:12] and it would take that in there
[1:24:14] and in just a 24-hour period of time
[1:24:19] that rod
[1:24:20] would bud
[1:24:22] blossom and produce almonds
[1:24:26] now let's just be honest that's just how
[1:24:29] quick it is when you can get into the
[1:24:31] friends of god how quick that god can
[1:24:34] change your life
[1:24:36] it's just how quick that god can change
[1:24:38] our attitude our outlook in a situation
[1:24:41] just getting into his presence if we can
[1:24:44] just put our life into his hands
[1:24:47] getting in his presence like brother
[1:24:49] brown said at first i felt like man i'm
[1:24:51] going to go and take this meeting but
[1:24:53] the more as i prayed and i waited and
[1:24:56] lingered a little longer everything
[1:24:58] changed
[1:25:00] what was it just dwelling in his
[1:25:02] presence just sit there and just soak it
[1:25:05] up and say what is it lord that you say
[1:25:08] about this
[1:25:11] you see the church world they're the
[1:25:13] ones telling god what they want
[1:25:18] i want the blood and i want this but i
[1:25:20] don't want him telling me how to dress i
[1:25:21] don't want to tell me how to live i
[1:25:23] don't want there they're the ones
[1:25:24] telling him this is what we'll do
[1:25:27] but don't you touch our lives
[1:25:29] don't you require any of this other
[1:25:31] stuff
[1:25:33] but we believe in the blood
[1:25:36] see they tell god what to do
[1:25:39] they tell god we're going to do this
[1:25:41] we're going to go do this and we're
[1:25:43] going to go do that
[1:25:45] brother graham tells us in perfect
[1:25:46] strength he said so many times he talked
[1:25:48] about people setting up tents and
[1:25:49] everything he said so many times people
[1:25:52] go and they do things in their own
[1:25:55] strength
[1:25:57] and any time we ever do anything in our
[1:25:59] own strength it ends in frustration
[1:26:04] because we're looking for results and
[1:26:06] we're not getting them because it's our
[1:26:08] strength but it's not our strength that
[1:26:10] god uses it's our life yielded to him
[1:26:14] it's his strength that's perfect it's
[1:26:16] his strength and moves through the
[1:26:18] church of the living god and his
[1:26:20] strength is his word the holy ghost made
[1:26:23] manifest and in the lives of the people
[1:26:26] it's that alive moving through
[1:26:29] when it got into his when he got into
[1:26:30] the friends of god
[1:26:32] it changed
[1:26:34] that rod it blossomed it budded it
[1:26:36] yielded almonds
[1:26:39] you know god gave a promise
[1:26:42] to israel
[1:26:43] he gave it to
[1:26:45] to jacob
[1:26:48] he also gave the same isaac spoke of
[1:26:50] this
[1:26:51] to esau too but remember esau could care
[1:26:54] less about all that was said
[1:26:57] but something that god told
[1:26:59] jacob
[1:27:00] it might seem so small so minuscule
[1:27:05] but it's a great blessing
[1:27:06] and he said in genesis 27 28 god give
[1:27:09] thee the dew
[1:27:11] of heaven
[1:27:12] i wish i could really preach on that
[1:27:14] right now but god give you the dew of
[1:27:17] heaven
[1:27:18] the dew itself
[1:27:20] it falls
[1:27:23] in silence
[1:27:25] it settles down
[1:27:28] in the night
[1:27:29] but the dew doesn't come during the day
[1:27:33] it comes at night when everything gets
[1:27:35] quiet
[1:27:36] gets settled
[1:27:38] and it's at peace
[1:27:41] this dew of promise many scriptures but
[1:27:45] god
[1:27:46] would make a promise i will give to thee
[1:27:49] the dew of heaven because it's the dew
[1:27:51] of heaven after that rain has went forth
[1:27:53] in the beginning the dew that would come
[1:27:55] upon herman the dew upon mount zion the
[1:27:58] dew upon the land of israel that would
[1:28:00] bring the refreshment to the seed that
[1:28:03] had been planted and the seed would come
[1:28:05] forth
[1:28:06] under the refreshment
[1:28:09] and the dew itself is a place of
[1:28:12] quietness it's a place of rest the dew
[1:28:15] brother would bring it in and type it is
[1:28:16] what falls
[1:28:18] in the holiest of wholeness
[1:28:21] it's the presence of god that moves down
[1:28:24] upon our lives
[1:28:26] and brings a real
[1:28:29] refreshing
[1:28:31] it's a do that brings a change
[1:28:34] in our life
[1:28:36] now think of this
[1:28:38] this do
[1:28:39] something that could be
[1:28:41] looked at and scoffed at and looked down
[1:28:43] on but this do
[1:28:45] is what would bring a refreshing to a
[1:28:47] life
[1:28:48] this do is what would bring a renewing
[1:28:51] to a life
[1:28:52] let me just leave you with this
[1:28:57] brother branham says
[1:28:59] in the message elisha the prophet i
[1:29:00] don't have it up there just just listen
[1:29:04] he says oh he says
[1:29:05] that early morning when the dew settles
[1:29:07] down
[1:29:08] there's something about the quietness of
[1:29:10] the night alone
[1:29:12] the dew falls
[1:29:13] and it freshens
[1:29:15] if we could only get quiet and alone
[1:29:17] with god
[1:29:18] how that do would strengthen us it would
[1:29:20] take the wilt
[1:29:22] out of us and make us fresh
[1:29:25] how many of you ever went out in a rose
[1:29:27] garden or you went out among flowers in
[1:29:29] the morning
[1:29:31] there's such a fragrance
[1:29:33] that's there
[1:29:34] lilies
[1:29:37] honeysuckles all the just there's an you
[1:29:39] can set on your porch
[1:29:41] i think about at times even at our other
[1:29:42] house i would sit on the porch and
[1:29:44] sometimes even just have my window open
[1:29:46] right there in the morning and all of a
[1:29:47] sudden that it was just just that
[1:29:48] fragrance of those lilac bushes that i
[1:29:50] had planted in different
[1:29:52] places around the house
[1:29:54] it was just oh it was so it was such a
[1:29:56] fresh smell
[1:29:59] and it would come from the morning
[1:30:02] you see it's the dew that would fall
[1:30:04] and the manna would fall upon the dew
[1:30:07] remember it was the dew that gideon said
[1:30:10] lord
[1:30:12] if you want me to go in this way let the
[1:30:14] dew fall upon the fleece
[1:30:17] then he would put the fleece out again
[1:30:19] and said let the fleece be dry and the
[1:30:21] dew fall around the dew brought answer
[1:30:23] to get in
[1:30:25] it brought it was a quietness it settled
[1:30:28] it
[1:30:28] you see with that quietness even when we
[1:30:30] look at the dew of the holy ghost
[1:30:32] falling into a life it doesn't mean that
[1:30:34] that person is alive and they're just
[1:30:36] setting you know lifeless but there is a
[1:30:38] something that brother brahm says it
[1:30:40] falls into our life that we know
[1:30:43] we know
[1:30:45] the person can say well they really got
[1:30:47] something and maybe they really didn't
[1:30:48] get something all the way down into
[1:30:50] their soul
[1:30:51] are you hearing me
[1:30:53] then there's other times you can say
[1:30:54] well i don't know about but remember
[1:30:55] when the dew moves down to the inside
[1:30:59] it's the dew that brings change
[1:31:04] in that place of surrender and
[1:31:06] refreshing
[1:31:10] the brand says oh he's talking about
[1:31:12] getting out among them flowers
[1:31:15] he said oh i said god
[1:31:18] in the run of the day and in the run of
[1:31:19] the days
[1:31:21] if i get
[1:31:23] all wilty
[1:31:25] and indifferent
[1:31:27] let me lay in your presence in the
[1:31:28] quietness alone with you
[1:31:31] then i come out fresh again
[1:31:33] anybody say yes lord
[1:31:35] if i get wilty
[1:31:37] and indifferent
[1:31:38] let me just go lay
[1:31:40] in your presence lord jesus
[1:31:43] oh he might have said that's what god
[1:31:44] wants to do with a fragrance
[1:31:47] of prayer

[1:31:52] by the blood of the lord jesus

[1:37:44] may we lord god i pray and really put
[1:37:46] that initiative in to get along with you
[1:37:49] lord god
[1:37:51] to get along with you
[1:37:52] your prophet said sometimes he would go
[1:37:54] drive down the back roads till he would
[1:37:56] get a loan all to himself
[1:37:58] but he put that in to get along
[1:38:02] i realized lord that every day of our
[1:38:04] life we can't go out on the back road
[1:38:06] somewhere
[1:38:07] but lord may we stay in that place
[1:38:11] of fellowship of communion
[1:38:13] and when we sense the things lord just
[1:38:15] aren't right
[1:38:16] just like it would be between a husband
[1:38:18] and a wife lord god or a family
[1:38:21] it would call together a conference
[1:38:23] [Music]

[1:38:29] for fellowship help us father i pray
[1:38:33] granted lord

[1:48:30] i had on my heart
[1:48:32] and i've watched how god has come and
[1:48:34] taken that gift
[1:48:36] and spoke directly
[1:48:38] and he didn't call it out word for word
[1:48:40] but it would be the answer
[1:48:41] [Music]

[1:48:46] i'm not the only one who's had that
[1:48:47] witness
[1:48:49] of how god has taken that sometimes god
[1:48:51] will use the pastor sometimes god will
[1:48:53] use another gift sometimes god can use a
[1:48:55] song
[1:48:58] but the point is
[1:48:59] is to be open and you know
[1:49:02] he always
[1:49:03] answers
