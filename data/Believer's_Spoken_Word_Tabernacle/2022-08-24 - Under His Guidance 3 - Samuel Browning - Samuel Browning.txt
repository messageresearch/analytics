bless you this evening if you'll turn with me to joshua chapter five so good to see you this evening and certainly a different day of the week but i'm glad that he's god each day of the week amen i'm glad that he's gone each day amen so we just as you're turning there in joshua chapter 5 verse 13 i certainly just covet your prayers as we thursday here leave out for from mexico there and then the services that the lord will just have his way and what god has in mind we just want to get in tune with his mind amen for what he has so i just certainly just asked that you'd just be in prayer and we'll certainly miss you i already miss you and i'm not even gone amen may god just come by and just just do something really special for us amen joshua chapter 5 verse 13. the scripture says and it came to pass when joshua was by jericho that he lifted up his eyes and looked and behold there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand and joshua went unto him and said unto him art thou for us or for our adversaries and he said nay but as captain of the host of the lord am i now come joshua fell on his face to the earth and did worship and said unto him what saith my lord unto his servant you know that's as we were looking at that last we can come to that point that's right there that's really where the battle was won there was the battle right there and it was one when joshua recognized who he was standing in the presence of and surrendered himself to the lord and the captain of the lord's host said unto joshua loose thy shoe from off thy foot for the place where on thou stand us is holy and joshua did so amen may god bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated just like to continue on that thought on under his guidance knowing that every promise that god has given to us as paul could say as we are in christ is yea and amen there's no there's no uncertainty with the promise of god or any promise and there's nothing wrong with with any promise or anything wrong with god but always the battle is us getting ourselves out of the way so many times in in and this is something that it happens it's not just daily but it happens in many situations many things that sometimes that we can try to take the word of god and we can try to will a situation to happen and when and go we know god will never come and do that because it'll be that would be to our glory we don't sometimes see it in that way and we need god to help us to be able to see that it's not us willing something to be done but it's surrendering our will to his will because he it's him to come and perform his word in our life and i know we we hear of this and we we speak of it and there's been many examples that we have given to it you know even over the time and over the years but it's always something good to come back to that it's it's always about us getting our own selves out of the way and when you consider that this here of jericho and what was before them it was the first objective but you know with everything that god lets to be placed before us god's saying something through every experience and one of the very the very first experience they come through after crossing the jordan being circumcised partaking of the passover eating of the old corn of the land after this the very first thing they come to is jericho a situation that's before him that it it looks as though if you're looking at the walls and looking at everything joshua doesn't know how it's going to come to how how they're going to take that sitting but he he knows by the grace of god that god has said i've given you everything in this land it's been years since those words were even uttered think of even how that god would speak through abraham that they would dispossess the inhabitants of the land and then god sends his messenger down there with a message and and you know the the applying of the blood of the lamb and begins to make these promises real real clear to them that let them know i'm bringing you out of this land and we're going to take you in taking you into a land that's flowing with milk and honey and and every every place that your foot treads upon i've already given it to you and and and when we we recognize that within it joshua had that that strong consolation that god has already given us the this of jericho but he's looking at the obstacles of what's before him and and when it comes to it the real obstacle itself is not what we're looking at that's not really the obstacle but the obstacle itself that we find many times that is a lot stronger has within a lot of of a greater mortar than any walls of jericho that's our own thinking our own will many times is put together with a lot we've we have pieced things together and put it together in it and yet god brings us every situation that god brings us to and let me just say it like this even situations that we in ourselves have created yet even in that god still desires to make his glory and his power known to you and i and god takes that because we're not a people that is perfect in ourselves there's mistakes there's failures there's things that we can even as we could get in the flesh of looking at things but yet if we can come back and yield to god and say lord i don't know in this situation i'm just going to step back and i'm going to give it into your hands and the greatest the greatest victory there ever is is yielding our lives to the lord it's yielding every step of the way that's the greatest battle that we have and to think of within this when here god makes himself known to joshua the same god who veiled himself in the pillar of fire is now standing here before joshua as a man and he announces who he is i am come now for this purpose not that you would tell me what to do or how to do it but i'm come in this situation to lead you in this battle god already knew what was out before him but joshua going out before the walls of jericho looking at him can you think of what thoughts would have crossed through his mind because he was a man of like passion such as you and i that can look at situations and the thoughts that would come and joshua knew brother ram tells us like this joshua had built and worked with that type of thing even down in egypt he knew the strength of those walls he knew how thick they were if anybody could rehearse or know what he was up against joshua knew that but joshua in looking at those walls and all those thoughts that could be coming to him but yet in the midst of all of that there was here how god showed up and god announced i'm here to lead this battle you know there had to be something already before god even had showed up that let god know it's time to step down there is a heart that that desires to be led by god there's a life that desires to be like i believe that's our heart's desire we want to be led by god more than anything and god help me that if my will is in the way help me lord god that that could be identified then help me to surrender lord melt it down to where it can be your will that's stepping down in joshua he's now here he is once he recognizes who he's in the presence of he he now as he falls to the ground he begins to worship and the voice comes forth forth loosened by shoes because the ground where you are standing is holy ground that ground was like any other ground but what made it holy ground is because almighty god was standing there on that ground and he noticed that loosening of the shoes what god was announcing to joshua that anyway that you had any thought about this situation i want you to loosen yourself from that thought of how this is going to be done and you see when god you or i can look at that many times and we could say how do i do that it's simple in this regards when god has said loosen my shoe we can say lord i take liberty with what you have said and i loosen myself from these thoughts because it's not a natural thing that's taking place it's just like if i could say you know to brother bill i could say you know to brother drake or brother shane or brother gamer i could say to anybody you know sometimes when you could be down i could say well brother carlos don't be down well it's not it's not that that we couldn't say that but there's got to be something within that there's supernatural to direct it in order to move and to change that situation and when god has made a statement in his word when he says lay it aside lay aside every way lay aside everybody setting sin when god says loose thy shoe then there is an authority of almighty god that is there if we'll just heed to that and say lord i loose my shoes i loose my will i loose this unto you there is a supernatural presence of almighty god with an authority to loosen us from going our own way hallelujah i'm glad about that i'm glad about that because we need his loosening in our lives and with every situation coming in what a what a moment of reverence as as the shoes are are loosened and taken off and begin to look and to recognize who was there remember god told moses when moses came up there to the burning bush and he was attracted to that to that site because here was a bush that was on fire yet was not consumed it was a miracle it was a paradox and it attracted moses now notice what it did it didn't just get moses up there on the mountain but that was also signification that god was drawing moses beyond moses there had to be something greater than the natural because the first exodus took place with god leading moses in an exodus beyond his own will that was where the victory was won that was where everything every miracle that was ever done in egypt was because that moses came to that moment and recognized in the presence of god i'm helpless lord i can't do this lord i need you lord jesus we need your strength we need your guidance and recognizing who he's in the presence of if we can just recognize that the victory is already won if you recognize you're in the presence of the mighty god then the victory is already won i don't care what rises up where is the mighty god that's standing there before us and reverence ourselves to that loose and oh god loosen my will loosen my thoughts concerning this because when we're honest there's many times of thoughts and things that we can say it's not that we have a question with god sometimes it's the way and the approach sometimes we get in the way and sometimes the way that god lets us if god himself doesn't altogether let us know how it's all going to come about not one person in here not one of us not one of us would elect to have go through a trial our flesh would never our flesh would never never desire that because you know what a trial is where the flesh weakness is displayed but when weakness and you say well then if if through that weakness that's when deity is displayed how can that be because when weakness is surrendered to god and coming back and recognizing that god has this in control you know what that is that's called worship when you can say lord i don't know what's going on but i know you've got it in control that's worship you're worshiping him brother branham tells us when we're standing in a store or something and we're able to speak to someone and say hasn't the lord may given us a beautiful day that's worship worship is not limited to where when music is going on but worship is something daily out of our life it's giving praise to god and even in the midst of that remember when paul said when paul could not understand what was going on remember he prayed three times that you know that it would come and go with his eyes and what he was seeing and he prayed thrice and finally god let him know that paul this is is is is my i have permitted this to come about but in the midst of this i want you to know paul that even though you feel weaker actually it's in these times that i am the strongest in your life my goodness that is beyond our natural thinking about things every one of us like to feel like when we i mean everybody likes to next to have that feeling of like when you're on the mountaintop and you've got everything in control everybody likes to feel that because it's something that just kind of it is a comfort to us but the thing that is not as comfortable to us is when we don't feel like we got everything in control but if you can recognize that there is a god that even the things that you and i didn't even know about and know all these other all these other avenues but he's always in control of every situation and all he asks for you and i to do is is yield and to recognize that and when we can do that paul said i will glory in my infirmities paul was not walking around and saying praise god i can't see praise god this affliction's on me that's not what it was when that affliction came paul said i'm going to turn up my praise i'm going to worship god this is not going to control me now listen it doesn't mean that you know bubble dancing i believe in that but what it was paul said this is not i'm not going to let it get me down i'm going to worship and you know what it says i will glory that the power or the tent of christ might set up on my life our flesh don't feel like glorying in that but remember what not glorying in our infirmities we're glorying in the sovereign providence of the omniscient god who knows all things he is omnipotent he's working everything sometimes you can look or i can look and think why why am i going through this but you recognize god has a testimony in each of our life there's a testimony that god has to be able to to give witness to give testimony to give encouragement to think about how god would allow you and i to go through things in order to give a testimony and an experience and a help to everyone else you believe that jesus standing there remember in john 14 and philip asked him said show us the father and that suffices that that'll that'll just that'll satisfy us and jesus when he speaks to him remember what he says he says how long have i been with you and you're asking me show us the father now what's he direct he's not notice where jesus here he is the word when there's a question it's a word question and notice what the word made flesh does it identifies itself by the word jesus could jesus has he unfolds this he he declares that that it's not the things that you're hearing it's not my words it's the father's words and it's not me that's doing the works it's my father that dwelleth in me he's the one that's doing the works and he's announcing then that you believe that you recognize that it's not me it's not a man this is not a natural thing but this is our heavenly father who's actually being declared and is right here among us why was he announcing that because when they can recognize that it is the almighty god that is standing present it stabilizes them that's what stabilizes you and i let me say something one thing we can pray about many times we can get into a place all we're doing is praying about this need and praying about this need i'm talking about even some of the same thing in our life and you know what you don't find you're getting anywhere you know why because we can't be focused on that we need to call him on the scene and ask god lord make yourself known you understand what i'm saying we keep we and these are times where even with prayer it isn't that we don't ask god lord that you would speak lord that you would die but we need him to come on the scene joshua went out there to know how are we going to take this battle and when he's going out there in that manner what joshua needs to see is that the same god is right there with them think of this in joshua chapter 6. i want to read this the bible said that jericho in verse 1 of joshua 6 jericho was straightly shut up because of the children of israel none went out none came in and the lord said unto joshua see i have given into thine hand jericho and the king thereof and the mighty men of valor so i've given them into your hand now joshua already had the certainty knowing that that jericho is what god desired them to take but now god is speaking to joshua and letting him know i've given it in your hand every inhabitant of this city i put it into your hand and you shall compass the city all you men of war and go round about the city once and thus shalt thou do six days and seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of seven ram's horns and the seventh day you shall compass the city seven times and the priest shall blow with the trumpets and it shall come to pass that when they make a long blast with the ram's horn and when you hear the sound of the trumpet all the people shall shout with a great shout and the wall of the city shall fall down flat and the people shall ascend up every man straight before him think of a song that we sing in this very old song learning to lean learning to lean because in every situation every trial every test and everything that comes to us it's really coming to a place of learning to lean we can we can something can come and it can come before us and we can be vexed about it we can look at it but in that of all the vexation and looking at all that has to come back to a place to say lord i'm going to trust in you lord it's learning to lean upon him and we know as we grow in the lord that doesn't become less it becomes more the closer we get to him the more that we recognize our insufficiency it's getting close to him and we recognize our need for more of him in need of his leadership this is why paul when he would write in the scriptures let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus let this mind be in you now you know when you have when you have been born again of the spirit of god you have received the mind of christ you have received that in your soul but we recognize that that is something that each day each moment of our life we have to let the mind of christ let him have preeminence we have to allow him to have the first place he has the first place but we have to let him have it every time that we've repented it's because we haven't let him have first place and you know there's something listen there's things that make it easier because let me say this just in case you don't know this thing has not been redeemed yet this thing this thing doesn't want to read this doesn't want to pray this doesn't want to listen to the message it does not want to do those things this is not saved no matter how long you've been serving god it doesn't matter it doesn't all of a sudden become easier but now the battle what you recognize as a mature believer is is that this thing i cannot allow this to rain because it takes me away from contact with god to where that the mind of christ is not operating as it should be it didn't mean you're gonna because when you've been born again you're not gonna go live in sin there's a there's one on the control tower there's no desire for sin but you see what happens is is putting ourselves in a situation that the mind of christ can have preeminence in our life that's why we're reading the word we take our bodies our lives and sit down we read and we pray and we're praying you know even throughout the day as god has spoken to us and listening to the mess what are we doing we're putting ourselves in a place and bringing it to where that the mind of christ might have the right of way i think of this statement here the greatest thing if i just gave that statement to you and say what would you say would be the greatest thing that you could ever see in your life probably a lot of different things that we would say because we have we have in our mind sometimes the way that we think about the greatest things it would be you know to walking on the water and that's a great thing because that's not that's not i mean i don't know about you i don't know the last time you walked on the water i walked on the water you know you know i mean so it's a great thing remember even when peter stepped out of the boat he asked the lord jesus bid me to come to you oh my we could preach on this now you peter just didn't take right out but he could have had faith to do that but it's an example to you and i that as we see the lord and what how god is moving we can ask him and say lord bid me because there is authority that comes with his voice when he says something we can step out on it because it's his voice that gives us the strength to defy all the elements and all the laws that are there it's the strength in his voice and that's the same way it is in our life as it was with peter look at that that's a great thing and it was a great thing and even in the midst of it when peter began to sink at least he cried out and said lord save me lest i perish so the same god that had given him authority to step out on is the same god that after fear had come in faith had been loosened from his life that same god came there and brought an authority and raised him up you didn't have to swim to the shore you have to swim back to the boat this the same god was right there hallelujah the greatest thing what would we say is the greatest thing let me let me read to you what brother randall says the greatest thing that i've ever seen in my life is just submit yourself to god and walk in the spirit day after day and how he'll lead you and he'll guide you to do things that's the greatest thing to be led by the spirit of god and if that's the greatest thing which it is to submit it's a submitting of our will there's a battle that goes on there's thoughts that come in there's even when you're going to do what's right the enemy can come and try to torment you in your mind sure he can is is not that's not an exemption no matter who you are or where you are saying i think how brother brown made a statement uh when he went over and he preached you know brother brown preached blind bartimaeus many times but one of the times brother brown says here he stands at the end of that message and after what god has done in that service and he says over there in the hotel how he says that satan has tormented my mind and telling me the people aren't going to get it they're not going to understand this they're not going to take this but brother bram says see look at that right there you see it's overriding that because satan knows even how we're made up sometimes and things can come in our mind but it's it's and you say how do we discern it well the voice of god will never bring condemnation god's voice will never bring fear it'll never bring fear that's binding to you like that that's not what god's voice does the voice of god releases you and i it's satan that works that way and that's one way to discern and you might say well i hear thoughts coming to me and they seem like they're in my voice but you discern those thoughts by the word and what i'm talking about by the word i'm talking about by the word you discern the characteristics of them think of this in the scriptures in hebrews 11 by faith the walls of jericho fell down now faith is what it's a revelation of god's will it's a revelation that before we see anything that this is the will of god now let's just be honest there's things within that we come face to face with that we don't have the same unfolding that joshua had where joshua seen the walls fall down but what is enough is that joshua seen it god opened to him by vision and then joshua could come back and say the victory belongs to us and that's the same way that the lord jesus has done and he does time and time again that you and i cannot see it already done i want you to understand seeing it already done is not faith as far as understand seeing all the outcomes of it this is going to happen like this this is going to happen like that this is going to happen that we don't don't always see that those are things sometimes that's very rare that it happens in that way but we walk by faith by knowing god this is the pathway that you're opening i prayed about this i've looked to you for direction lord and above everything else if it's not your will you know you still know how to close everything off lord because ultimately in everything i want your will above it all i might be a little disappointed but i want your will my disappointment i'll get over there but your will lord that's what i want because i desire that you be glorified because i can't make this happen but lord you're more than able to bring it to pass by faith the walls of jericho had fallen down but the the bible says after they were compassed about seven days now think about this the walls are going to fall you see it's one thing to say the walls are going to fall and then somebody comes and tells you here comes joshua back in the camp he announces he has to gather together the camp and let them know jericho belongs to us you've known that god has spoken and here's how the lord is going to do it how is that joshua shall we get our crowbars ready to go no let me tell you how it's going to happen this is what he said he said we're going to shout and the walls are going to fall i wonder i wonder to the minds when that first was said right there if the mind itself likes sarah when it came when sarah heard thou shalt conceive and sarah could say we've been trying this for a long time and to no avail sarah knew the hindrances she knew the obstacles but it wasn't her body that was the obstacle [Applause] it wasn't her body that was the obstacle her eye her body was no problem for god but god came down to deal with sarah's unbelief because the unbelief was greater than any barrenness of her womb and that's why god has come down now as the captain of the large house in this generation is to deal with the unbelief he didn't he didn't send a portion or a part he came himself he is here among us [Music] and he's letting you and i know that there has been down through the ages there's been parts of that of man but in this time i made a promise at the revealing of the son of man that i would come in my fullness and the mind would set down upon the people do you understand what we have access to we have access to the mind of christ this is why the scripture in john 14 show us the father brother adam's just not quoting bible verses he's announcing under the inspiration by the revelation that is given to him he is the one who's been here all alone this ministry is not william branham it's the ministry of the son of man not a church to lead us not an idea to lead us but as captain of the lord's house am i now come that's what the whole unfolding of the seventh seal is it's revealing the christ who always was has always been here and now he is declaring his glory among his people hallelujah it's the same god he didn't leave us he's right here with us remember as he reveals himself by his word he comes and he speaks to our life listen right here tonight in a thursday service a sunday service it doesn't matter hearing god himself makes himself known that i'm still captain of the lord's host now it comes to you and i will we allow him to have his rightful position and say lord i don't understand how a shout is going to bring down walls but i trust you lord god hallelujah oh glory to the carnal mind it was foolishness i mean come on when's the last time you shouted something down right foolishness joshua knew about them walls if any of you want to talk to anybody about walls and all the metrics and physics and everything else joshua knew that you see what that shows that the things that you and i come face to face with there's a lot of times there's things that you and i come face to face with and we can look at and say well i know this or i know that and i know this but god says there is a greater understanding here than your understanding amen you're not just you're not just you know we like that little mechanic he was putting this here and putting that little wire there putting this little wire here testing this testing that you know you can all say well at least he was doing something but to think he was doing this doing that doing this doing that and here came up a man in a suit and tie and looked over in that open uh uh under the hood and he spoke to him and said why don't you take this wire and touch it here just by looks here's a mechanic maybe grease up to his elbows shirt all rolled up he works on cars for a living but here comes one up there and when he takes the wire and touches that the problem's soft now he's got a choice that little mechanic could have looked at the suit and the suit itself he could have said who are you but he was in such a place was that he heeded what was said and when that started it caused him to ask who are you he said i am the engineer who designed that engine and that's why the prophet could announce there is a man here that can turn on the light it's jesus christ the son of man right here among us we can try to touch this to this to this to this to this to this to this to this but if we'll just let him direct us he knows how to tell us touch this to this in the midst of it joshua after hearing this he couldn't only he didn't lean to his own understanding he could have you realize he could have do you realize he had to override his own understanding because his understanding knew about the walls right just like a you know when a doctor or a nurse or they can only give you the understanding that they have all this could never be your eyes will always be this way it's just gonna they're only giving you the understanding they know but there's a greater understanding that sets down where does that understanding come from it comes from the captain of the host of the lord hallelujah and inspires you inspires you and anoints you and others can look at you and even to your own way of thinking it sounds crazy are you hearing me it sounds crazy this is gonna that god is my healer i'm not gonna this right here is passing from my life are you hearing me this is where you we have to go beyond our own thinking have to go beyond what we see because what we see is not real it thanks we think it's real are you hearing me that's why i like the definition that brother ernie of illinois came up with with fear he said here's what fear is it's false evidence appearing real it's true isn't it things come in you know and my goodness you entertain the thought and everything else they have you in such a work up in no time you entertain it what happened was it shows you that thoughts themselves are not just empty little things it's spirits it's spirit so if satan works that way i don't know about you but i want to fill my mind with thoughts of god i just want to fill it up he said brother samuel i can't remember it it ain't about remembering at all i just want if there's going to these airwaves are going to be filled with things i want it to be filled with the things of god whether it's music the word of god i want it to be filled with the word of god to where that do when i do get out there in the public my life has become so full and filled up with god because remember our minds are in no man's land so with that no man's land it depends on what are we going to fill it with whatever you fill it with will affect you sometimes it isn't even watching the news or looking at this sometimes it's entertaining you can get to looking at your own insufficiencies and not looking at them through the blood of jesus christ you say how do i do that you can say lord i'm nothing without you i have failed you lord many times but your grace is sufficient lord that you would teach me lord you would strengthen me within all this sometimes god has to allow you and i to see that we in ourselves are nothing we don't have this all together oh glory be to god joshua got out to himself graham said he went out to meditate and pray sometimes that getting away is not all together maybe getting away from the house sometimes it's getting away from us if i can get away from samuel right you can get away from carlos you get away from bill you get away from richie he said how do i do that how do i get away is it just getting along with god how do i get along with god just begin to look to him and begin just to worship him begin to worship him you might feel so inadequate you might feel so oh lord i i'm such a failure i judge you but don't don't entertain that in that way but look to him and say lord you're worthy begin to worship him because he is the worthy one when we begin to get away from our own selves our own thinking that's why i said when we're praying sometimes and i'm speaking from experience i know i'm preach preaching to people within that experience as well sometimes there's things that we can pray about and we're praying about this need maybe it's family or something else and we're praying about it or it's things you know these particular needs in the church or this particular answer and we're praying or praying and so we become soul within that right there that we really don't get away from our own thoughts about it instead of saying lord as we can pray and commit it to god and we pray and begin to pray just begin to worship him because that's what's going to invite him because let me tell you something no matter what the situation is god is greater than that situation you first have got to start with that god you're greater than this problem you say brother samuel what is that well that's called not looking at the scene but looking to the unseen i want you to remember that they had to go around these walls of jericho for seven days and for six days they had to go around one time now these people knew they're not gonna fall on the first time around it was already enough to accept and believe that of what god had said because never has walls fallen down walls are going to come down by the sound of a trumpet a shout that doesn't line up right and let alone going around those walls remember jericho is shut up nobody's coming in or out and i wonder when they went around after the first day they go back they come the second day i wonder if they just didn't start hearing now maybe nobody was you know coming out real bold and saying look at these guys maybe they just you know smirks i wonder what was being said because when they walked around there do you understand there was a battle going on every step every journey around that wall was a testimony and was a confession the bible says that he had put everything under his feet howbeit we see not all things under his feet but it goes on to say seeing that we have an high priest seeing that we have a high priest who can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities let us hold fast to our profession that the first day around nothing happened and they knew nothing was going to happen second day around nothing happened but let me tell you though there wasn't any walls that was falling down but every day walls was crumbling in their lives faith was being built in the promise of almighty god joshua saw the vision and he announced it by the word of god he spoke by the revelation of his faith are you hearing me he spoke by the revelation of his faith and there were for those lives that god would inspire that word and they would simply let go of their thoughts and start marching around jericho they overcame the mockery they overcame every thought that would come into their mind what are you doing here you know how silly this looks you know what i'm talking about you know what i'm talking about they weren't just walking around they were there this is battle this speaks to you and i that even when you know god's will satan is not going to back up and say whoa paul knows the will of god he knows the will of god satan is there to try to rattle you [Applause] he wants to try to draw you out i wonder how many things were being said off the walls when it came to the fifth day the wickedness and what it was on the sixth day the enemy thought my goodness i've got this but here came the seventh day and on the seventh day something was different israel was marching around these walls not once not twice they marched seven times around the wall identifying this is the completion there was not a shout that went forth before the ending of that seventh age seventh day but at the ending of that seventh time notice all seven trumpets sounded in unison every thunder sounded all altogether and what did that thunder do that thunder brought a revival in the lives of the bride of jesus christ [Music] every voice sounded in unison and when that sounded they knew it was time for them to shout and what were they shouting they were shouting what the trumpets had sounded it was a shout of victory [Music] and the walls came down [Applause] at the trumpets and the sounding of the shout let me tell you the shout has brought down every wall satan could think he's got things walled in on your life maybe a sickness maybe a habit you can think he's got it walled in but it's no match for god amen the captain of the lord's host is here it might have escaped and like brother brown said it's walled to the doctor but it's not walled to god so daily what were they doing daily they were walking with a confession that this promise is mine daily they were walking step by step how's this going to be how's it going to be god made it known and it was beyond that of the natural mind where did that all come it all come through prayer right he came through prayer joshua knowing this is the certainty that he comes back to ask the father anything in my name and i'll do it lord what's what's your will in this lord what's your will now think of this think of the other part let me close with this the walls fall flat amazing here's a little lady by the name of rahab her house is on the wall walls falling flat that's a huge thing but her house remains as a matter of fact her house has been so established that when it came time joshua tells the men go in and get rahab and her family she could feel the walls rocking swaying giving way but she was on a firm foundation she had a token of the living god of the same captain of the lord's house that had revealed himself to joshua she had a token and she had operated under that token to get her family in there and when the walls were rocking her house was on a solid rock it shows that in the midst of the test or trial and what you're praying about everything else can be rocking and reeling all around you but you've got an anchor in jesus christ it goes beyond the natural mind that's why when we pray father that are in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth even as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread give me the strength lord what is needed in this day give me lord the nourishment of your word of the holy spirit lord what's needed in this moment lord and lead me not into temptation lord but deliver me from evil father that is the kingdom the power and the glory forever and ever amen that's what we need no matter the situation friends listen no matter the situation what we really need that makes it so simple it's just a simple statement he makes in great warrior joshua joshua went to pray and he met the captain of the lord's host and when he met him that was it that's what we really need to be seeking for no matter no matter what what is taking place around us no matter what adversity no matter what obstacle no matter walls whatever it is we say lord let your will be done lord here lord you you lord i i need to see you father and i believe we see him i believe he comes and he he speaks to us through his word he performs his word as he said he would do but we can just take a hold in that you know sometimes we can we can fail to see what god is doing in the midst of a service and how that he's coming and he's pulsating right through his word it's pulsating to our heart sometimes we don't catch that pulsation or rather we don't give it preeminence like we should we still entertaining our problem still entertaining what's there instead of taking that pulsation as it begins to pulsate in our lives i'm the lord i'm the lord that healeth thee i'm the lord your deliverer i'm the lord who gives the holy ghost and the and it begins to pulsate in our lives and then we can start looking back at the problem but don't don't look at the problem you'll never get anywhere by looking at it you have to look to the unseen let me tell you friends there's no situation nothing that's too great for god if god would have told joshua go up to the door and the doors will fall down that still would have been a miracle but god takes things that are so ridiculous to the mind that you just don't make sense to the mind but that's where god is able to declare his glory and his power and it's not just for that moment because there's going to be more walls you'll come up against there'll be other situations you come up against and it looks oh that's very thick oh that's a thick wall brother sammy you don't know how i'm telling you my son's a thick guy no but there's nothing that's too great for god but like joshua the first thing we have to say is lord what would you have your servant do and the first thing as he worships and he says that the first thing is stop your ways take your ways off the shoes take your ways off lord why do i need to take my shoes off just release your ways to me and god doesn't have to tell you and i this is you know this is going to happen this way and god doesn't have to do that he doesn't have to tell us like we look in our directions when we're on a trip you're going to go five miles on on you know 58 you're gonna make a right onto jones road and you're gonna that's not how god works it's trusting him the bigger wall than the walls of jericho was the wall of joshua's own will that was a bigger wall than the walls of jericho that held more impossibilities than the walls of jericho coming down the walls of jericho coming down were nothing compared to joshua's will it's our will it's the battle and the lord jesus in the garden of gethsemane he prayed three times so you know what that shows there's a wrestling and there's a war and remember the war is with our own will while we're wrestling with our own will demons are encamped round about spirits are encamped around about remember just like samson right there in the time of the arena where the most philistines were slain all were mocking and laughing at him when the lord jesus was in the garden of gethsemane brother bram says every demon out of torment was gathered all around it was like a great coliseum so the wrestling everything everything was put before him he knew what awaited him with the crucifixion and he prayed knowing nobody else could take his place he knew that sounds pretty personal don't it nevertheless not my will thine will be done goes comes back again and he prays the same prayer goals comes back again praise it the same time if the lord jesus had to pray that three times how much more for you and i many times where we fail is is after one time we feel like i still feel the struggle that don't mean you're defeated it just means you're putting your will in subjection so what do i do go back and pray again say lord god let my will die lord to your will listen i feel my will surging again what do i do go once again say lord not my will thine will be done but too many times we give up too quickly and our own will gets in the way is that right sister mercy used to sing a song lord keep me in your will so i don't get in your way right because when we're not in his will we're in the way right but may we submit our wills to him lord help me help me lord that my will can be so surrendered to your will in every situation it's not just a one-time thing it's situation after situation and remember that's where the battle was won and let me just ask you how was that battle won how was that battle won jesus was not quoting scripture to himself he could have right he could have because we're told let the redeemed of the lord say so let the weak say i am strong he could have done that but how was that victory won through prayer so then it lets us see that prayer is really us humbling ourselves to the will of god that's where real prayer is real prayer isn't that we have said paragraphs and lord i've called everybody's name out but real prayer is when we can come to the place to recognize we're in his presence it might be when you're in your prayer closet it might just be that you recognize when you're driving down the road there's one in the truck with you there's one in the car with you and you begin to worship him and entertain his presence oh there's victory isn't there let's pray heavenly father lord you are so merciful and so mindful lord in every need each situation lord that lord could ever be placed before us i think lord that every one of us here that's gathered in this building lord tonight whether lord we are before a jericho have been before a jericho or they'll be a jericho lord every thing that's always right before us and lord sometimes it isn't the things that we look at sometimes or we get in trouble that we say oh that's impossible sometimes lord where we get in trouble is where we think we can do something about it god help us lord lord i pray for everyone in here including myself help us lord jesus that god that we can recognize each moment our need for you lord not just when lord the situation or or lord an obstacle arises that may we lord take in our lives daily give us our daily bread lord that we would live and fill our lives with the word of god david said i have set the lord always before me and i shall not be moved because he is at my right hand he is my strength in my life i've set him before me oh god lord whatever that situation whatever that means may we look away to you tonight lord may we see only you lord may we put footsteps around those walls lord maybe situations lord in a family god may we put footsteps of the love of god may we lord follow your way i'm sure lord that that brother his name slips my mind right now lord but him and his wife did not lord she always was very despairing disparaging against lord of his walk with you that of the pentecostal movement she always had something to say and it wasn't her it wasn't her lord but how that lord the enemy had been able to come in there and his way of doing it was to grab her pull her out in the middle of the floor and he was going to cast that spirit off of her and it was a spirit but that wasn't the way to cast it off her that was not how those walls were going to fall but your prophet was able to take the brother aside and lord more than just what the prophet gave thank god there was a heart that was willing to lay down his own way his own will his own thinking and he said the next time get a box of chocolates and when you go into her and she starts on that [Music] just give her those box of chocolates tell her you love her lord when that brother came back to brother branham this is the testimony he said brother branham my home has been revolutionized it wasn't the chocolates that did it but god it was that of a surrendered will to your will lord we've all been there maybe tonight that god where we've taken things we've wielded and we've known that a situation oh this this needs this this needs to be changed this needs to be reversed but all we find is lord our will and all it is doing it doesn't bring any release but father tonight you're here with a real simplicity a simplicity that lord even tonight that no matter what the situation is you're not here to give step by step by step like turn go out of the parking lot make a left-hand turn go up to the first street make a right come to the second stop sign make a left and no but you're here tonight and may our wheels be melted in your presence and say lord like that little mechanic i'm tired of touching the wire here touching the wire there it's been me what do you say lord what do you say lord i say tonight lord that one of the greatest things that we could request and ask of you is speak my lord speak my lord that that was the victory the victory itself is surrendering our will that's the victory that's where lord is your prophet as he placed it there in the message the breach he takes us to the garden of gethsemane and zebra it declares to us right there that's where the lamb wrestled it out and prevailed right there that's the same way lord in our lives it's wrestling it out lord oh god may our will be melted lord may we lord as we step away even tonight from this service may we recognize lord the value of just talking to you throughout the day may we see the value the lord of being in the house of god see the value of lord listening to the message of the hour even at times we put it on and we think i'm doing this housework or i'm fixing this or i'm painting this may we just lord recognize even we put on that lord that gospel music that our lives are being saturated lord with you help us lord i pray help us lord may our will be melted lord surrendered to your will father that's the real prayer lord that's the real prayer lord so many times lord is needs and situations lord arise but that's my prayer is lord what's your will in this i can look at something but i want to know what your will is in it lord how would you say to how how should we do this lord how do we approach this because you know your sheep by name you know them lord each person you know our lives so personally granted lord i pray oh lord in the name of jesus christ thank you lord amen you know i just i just so appreciate the lord how that he would speak to us in these things because we could look at and we could think of the walls of jericho and maybe you see in your own life you see in your life you say well brother samuel i've got this particular maybe it's a condition in your body or something you know and your spirit or something and you could look at it and say well sam you know i you know here i've got to take medicine for this but don't look down don't look down on yourself that's that's that's not god doing that that's walking around jericho putting footsteps around it now you and i may not look at it as glorious as we would like to see this i wonder how many people think about the young man the young brother where they sold everything to come to the meeting because that boy had that growth and when they got there and came across the platform the angel of the lord speaks through the prophet and tells them this is what's wrong with your little boy there's an old country doctor who can perform this surgery now i wonder how many others right there on the platform where the angel of the lord just as he came and just sovereignly just spoke in that moment you have to you have to step back and remember god already knows all things god is not acting now contrary to his word god is acting according to his word but think about what that man felt like i've often put myself in those shoes when i've read that story many times i've reflected on that because you feel like when brother braham said he was disappointed you feel that think about what brother branham must have felt knowing what this man he had had they sacrificed to come to that meeting but you know there is a statement that the greatest surgeons in the nation at that time mayo clinic and they had made a statement concerning this boy this situation is inoperable nobody can operate on it i don't know about you but to me i look at these things and i see it in a spiritual context god let it be known that these who were regarded as the most astute and affluent and the most uh sublime of surgeons and god said i've got a little old new name country doctor that can do that what was god letting you and i know that it doesn't take a name to do something god was letting us know that it doesn't take something big or what we look at in our minds and say oh yeah that's acceptable here he's walking on the street he's down i know you know this testimony maybe some don't he's walking on the street the next day down and here's a lady who comes and the lady as she comes across she says what's wrong with your little boy he begins to tell her and she says oh you know what she said there's a right outside of town here there's a there's there's a doctor right outside of town here you got to go out on this road and you know he he operates on those things and you know what the man did this is brother brown telling it in the story i love it the man just kept walking right after that but he got a block away and he realized wait a minute what was said last night on the platform and what this woman just said he turns around and he runs and he says ma'am where did you say that doctor was amen you know what he was doing he had to submit his will to god's will his will is no different from what you and i would have wanted we want to see our children well you want to see this or our bodies to feel well and and to look at it in that way we would be looking at it let me tell you what the glory was is he was will he was able by the grace of god to surrender his will to the will of god and the surgery was performed and the baby was made whole it may not happen the way we think it's going to happen but don't let that stop you from marching it may not be going like you think it should be going but don't let it stop you from marching you keep going around it no matter if it's the little smirks and the smirks become to here you are again how long have you been waiting on this when's the last time you were prayed for haven't you been prayed for that about three or four times what are you gonna do keep marching what are you doing i'm just building i'm not my faith be built but don't worry there's a seventh day with seven trumpets and you're gonna shout in the meantime say what the word says confess what he has said and watch god bringing us into position for the walls to come down you love him tonight amen throw and be the god marching let's stand go ahead lead us hallelujah marching on [Music] my [Music] god's son [Laughter] [Music] a reflection of your love [Music] let your love shine through me [Music] oh just leave me lord i'll follow [Music] [Laughter] [Music] let your words speak to me speak to me show me what i've never seen [Music] for before i want to be a witness but you

surrender all [Music] [Music] oh i'll tell you how i think we could just all sing that song day in and day out lord let go and let god have his way not being some things we can look back and just seeing this is part of the battle plan just for us to come to that place and sing lord let my will be dissolved lord let my will be dissolved in every situation lord let my will be dissolved amen don't you love him tonight amen hallelujah let go and let god [Music] [Music] let oh [Music] [Applause] have his wonderful way let go and let god [Music] [Music] today god bless you tonight you're
