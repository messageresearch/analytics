[37:16] Lord. You are awesome in this place.
[37:22] Mighty
[37:24] God, let's all stand tonight. You are
[37:28] awesome in this
[37:30] place of a
[37:33] [Music]
[37:35] father. You are worthy of all
[37:39] praise. To you our lives we
[37:43] raise. But you are awesome in this
[37:47] place. Mighty God. Sing it once again.
[37:51] Oh, you are awesome in this place,
[37:56] mighty
[37:59] God. Lord, you are awesome in this
[38:04] place of a
[38:09] father. You are worthy of all
[38:14] praise. To you last we raise.
[38:20] You are awesome in this place, mighty
[38:25] God. One more time. You are awesome in
[38:31] this place, mighty God. Oh, he's worthy
[38:37] tonight. You are awesome in this
[38:42] place, a father.
[38:47] Father, you are worthy of all
[38:51] praise. To you our lives we
[38:56] raise. You are awesome in this
[39:00] place. Mighty God,
[39:06] you are awesome in this
[39:09] place. Mighty God.
[39:14] Hallelujah.
[39:17] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[39:20] Oh, hallelujah.
[39:23] He's worthy of all the praise that we
[39:25] could ever give him.
[39:27] I know that every day that we live, when
[39:29] we
[39:30] walk, there's a praise about our life.
[39:34] And I thank God
[39:35] that for the grace he's given us, others
[39:39] would love to have hands to raise.
[39:42] that they have their own way that maybe
[39:45] they're not able to do that. But to
[39:47] think what a privilege it is to worship
[39:50] the Lord.
[39:52] And you know the reality of it is is
[39:54] that
[39:55] really only those can worship him that
[39:59] really know who he is.
[40:02] It's true worshippers that worship him
[40:04] in spirit and in truth. Amen. And when
[40:08] he's been revealed to you personally,
[40:11] there's a
[40:12] worship that comes out of your life.
[40:16] No wonder I love how the scripture when
[40:18] David would say, "Praise waiteth for
[40:22] thee in Zion, oh God."
[40:24] While the rest of the world and
[40:26] everything else, they it's rallying
[40:29] around what they do, right? even among
[40:32] churches rallying around their their
[40:36] thoughts and their ideas. But I'm so
[40:39] thankful that the rally of our hearts is
[40:43] around the true gift of God, the Holy
[40:46] Spirit. To see him for who he really is.
[40:51] And when we see him for who he really
[40:52] is, all you can see is the grace of God
[40:54] for your life. And to realize it's it's
[40:58] not of works. It's not anything that we
[40:59] could ever do or ever have done to merit
[41:02] his favor. It's the unmmerited favor of
[41:06] Almighty God. And truly, it's his grace
[41:08] that has come by to grace our lives that
[41:12] we can even accept what he's already
[41:15] done. And that's what we're here
[41:17] tonight. We're worshiping him in a
[41:20] finished work. Praise God. And even in
[41:23] our lives, no matter where you're at in
[41:25] your life
[41:26] tonight, we're worshiping him for not
[41:29] only what he's done, what he's doing,
[41:31] but what's going to be added in our life
[41:34] tonight. And you know, the real reality
[41:36] is it's not so much that it's going to
[41:38] be something that's going to so so much
[41:40] come to be added. It's what the Holy
[41:42] Spirit's going to do that will actually
[41:44] cause us to release what he's already
[41:46] put in us.
[41:48] Because every leaf, every apple, it's
[41:50] already in that seed.
[41:53] The only thing now is for us to get out
[41:54] of the way. That's that's the holy thing
[41:57] is Lord, let more of the word. As the
[41:58] prophet said, as we receive the word, we
[42:00] become the word. Amen. Let the Holy
[42:03] Spirit flow through us tonight. Let it
[42:04] just flow. Let it Lord, just let me be
[42:06] part of the conduit. Let me be part of
[42:08] the channel tonight. Amen. Let's get
[42:10] into that channel in one accord. And I
[42:12] tell you, there's nothing nothing. The
[42:15] prophet said it in one place in greatest
[42:17] valley. He said, "If we all can get in
[42:18] one mind and one accord, there'll not be
[42:20] one person that's desiring the baptism
[42:22] of the Holy Ghost, healing, and so
[42:24] forth, not one thing will be withheld."
[42:26] Amen. And you know the reality, you
[42:28] don't have to wait till a certain time
[42:29] of the service. He's God all the way
[42:32] through. He knows your needs all the way
[42:35] through. And we just want this is the
[42:37] greatest thing that I think about it in
[42:39] this hour that he can come among us and
[42:44] be himself.
[42:46] You ever been to somebody's house and
[42:48] you know you can't be yourself? you get
[42:50] around them and you're like,
[42:52] I'm not really at liberty here to, you
[42:56] know, you just
[42:59] But when you get around somebody that
[43:01] you can be yourself, and I know I'm
[43:02] talking about things in the natural, but
[43:04] how much more the Lord Jesus,
[43:08] you know, the message of the hour has
[43:10] made a way. Amen. That's Christ. He's
[43:14] made a way for himself to come and be
[43:17] himself. How many want that tonight and
[43:19] say, "Lord, just be yourself here
[43:21] tonight. Make yourself at home, Lord.
[43:24] Every avenue of my life, every door of
[43:26] my life, every channel, Lord, I'm
[43:29] available. Lord, speak to my heart
[43:32] tonight." And just let him go deeper in
[43:34] every one of our lives. Let him go
[43:37] deeper. Amen. So good to have brother
[43:40] Jeremy and Sister Hannah, as Paul had
[43:41] mentioned. It's good to have brother
[43:43] Nathaniel, Brother Randy. It's good to
[43:45] have brother Randy on American soil.
[43:49] Amen. But we so appreciate Brother Randy
[43:51] and Sister Alice. Appreciate all your
[43:53] years of service. Appreciate all your
[43:55] labors. Amen. I mean
[43:59] that. Amen. We Let's invite Brother
[44:01] Jeremy and we want him to just have his
[44:04] liberty here tonight. He's no stranger.
[44:06] I Brother Randy He's been over there to
[44:08] brother Randy's a a number of times I
[44:09] guess in the past. I didn't even know
[44:11] that. Uh but you know, we met one
[44:14] another down at U BYC and I think it's
[44:17] been two or three years ago now and uh
[44:20] we just really just so appreciate his
[44:23] spirit. When you get around someone, I I
[44:25] want to catch their spirit, you know,
[44:26] and see how see how they are and and uh
[44:30] he he's got a wonderful ministry. And
[44:32] that's, you know, the anytime when you
[44:34] hear that kind of a compliment come,
[44:36] it's because somebody's been able to get
[44:38] out of the way. I I don't care whether
[44:40] somebody takes their jacket off. I don't
[44:42] care whether they're fiery. I I don't bo
[44:44] I want to hear from God. Amen. Because
[44:46] God comes in many different forms,
[44:50] but his nature is always the same.
[44:53] And so I don't mean to build I'm not
[44:56] building brother Jeremy up, but I want
[44:57] to say he knows this. I have I really
[44:59] appreciate his gift and I appreciate how
[45:01] God uses him. God, every one of us,
[45:04] ministers that are standing here and
[45:05] every one of us, we're all unique in the
[45:07] way that God has made us. And you know,
[45:09] the greatest compliment even as young
[45:10] people, you know, the greatest
[45:12] compliment every one of us can ever give
[45:14] give to the Lord is simply be who God
[45:17] has made us to be
[45:20] because the Lord Jesus just wants to be
[45:22] himself through your life. I say, Lord,
[45:25] just fill at home. Amen. Brother Jeremy,
[45:28] come, brother. We're we're so so
[45:30] thankful to have him here. You are

[47:32] here, but you do. And so, Father, we
[47:35] surrender our hearts, our minds, and the
[47:38] busy schedule of our lives, Father, and
[47:41] just the questions that we may have,
[47:44] Lord, and ask that you would just come
[47:47] as you would and speak to our hearts.
[47:51] We know the enemy will try to do
[47:52] whatever he can through this service to
[47:55] get to our
[47:56] minds to pull us aside. But Father, if
[47:59] we'll just sit at your feet now. Amen. I

[48:21] when we leave this place, Father, we'll
[48:23] know it was you and not a man. Father,
[48:26] it's more than a song that is sung, more
[48:28] than music that is played, how loud, how
[48:30] quiet we are, Father. As long as we can
[48:33] get in touch with you and break through
[48:34] the atmosphere of oursel Lord, we thank
[48:37] you, Father, for all of these things in
[48:40] Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Can we just do

[50:33] Don't you? Not just in a church service.
[50:36] This will be over, but I want my entire
[50:39] life to be used by him. Wherever we may
[50:41] go, wherever we may do, let's let his
[50:44] presence rule our life. Amen. And it's
[50:47] good to be here tonight. And uh good to

[50:52] familiar. Brother Andy, Brother
[50:53] Nathaniel. It's been a while, but it's
[50:55] good to see y'all. And uh the rest that
[50:57] are not familiar, it's good to see you.
[51:00] And I know that he's here to deal with
[51:03] our hearts. And uh you don't know me in
[51:05] a sense of how I am. And so if I was to
[51:09] tell you that what the Lord has let upon
[51:12] our heart tonight would be different,
[51:13] you wouldn't even know who I am. But,
[51:16] uh, I don't
[51:17] normally use this in an an atmosphere or
[51:20] a setting of evangelizing or going
[51:22] around, but for the last week, I
[51:24] couldn't get away from this thought
[51:26] tonight. So, I just trust that the Lord
[51:28] has a plan for it. And so, if I seem
[51:31] nervous above and beyond, it's because I
[51:33] am. And I just want to be in his in his
[51:36] will tonight. So, we'll try to jump
[51:39] right into this uh tonight. And uh I
[51:42] don't know if I have this set for you
[51:43] can if it's up here how this works or if
[51:46] it's ready to go. Um bear with us on
[51:49] this. But uh 1 Corinthians chapter 10 is
[51:53] where we want to turn
[51:54] to. And I do want to say it's a
[51:58] privilege to be here. And brother
[52:00] brother Sam and
[52:03] uh I done forgot his wife's name. Sister
[52:06] Kimberly. Sister Kimberly. Sister Cam.
[52:09] Something like that. I'm horrible with
[52:11] names, but it's a privilege to to be
[52:14] here and it's good to to to know him and
[52:17] to meet him and such a kindred spirit
[52:20] and just trust that tonight that we can
[52:22] uh be a help in any way that we can.
[52:24] This is different in the sense that it's
[52:26] uh normally when I go I evangelize and
[52:28] I'm kind of all over. But tonight we're
[52:30] going to I just feel to deal with the
[52:32] individual, the heart to kind of get to
[52:35] the personal side of things because I
[52:37] believe in a Holy Spirit that can change
[52:39] you and can do something for you. But
[52:41] you have to be honest with God. And
[52:43] we've dealt with this. I know I know
[52:45] brother Randy, brother Nathaniel,
[52:46] brother brother Sam and ministers,
[52:48] pastors have dealt with this situation.
[52:50] But perhaps something would be said
[52:52] tonight that will help us along our way.
[52:56] 1 Corinthians chap 10:12 says,
[52:58] "Wherefore let him that thinkketh he
[53:01] standeth. Take heed lest he fall. And
[53:05] there hath no temptation taken you, but
[53:07] such as is common to man." I like this.
[53:11] But God is faithful. Amen. who will not
[53:14] suffer you to be tempted above that you
[53:17] are able, but will with the temptation
[53:20] also make a way to escape that you may
[53:23] be able to bear it. Notice you're still
[53:27] going to have to go through these
[53:28] things, but he's going to help you get
[53:30] through it.
[53:32] Verse 14 is very important. We'll end
[53:33] with this. Wherefore, my dearly beloved,
[53:36] flee from
[53:38] idolatry. God bless you. You can be
[53:41] seated.
[53:42] a complex
[53:45] situation. This is very and I I hope
[53:47] that I'm not messing it up with this
[53:49] microphone here. I hope it's all okay.
[53:52] Uh if we take a look at this thought and
[53:55] we and we deal with our individual life
[53:58] and how we and how we understand, we
[54:01] want to we want to look at this and say
[54:03] what is a complex? Again, it is a a
[54:05] complex is a group of emotionally
[54:08] significant ideas that are entirely or
[54:11] partially
[54:13] repressed causing a psychological
[54:16] conflict and leading to abnormal mental
[54:19] states or behavior. It is also an
[54:23] exaggerated reaction to or preoccupation
[54:27] with a subject or situation. You could
[54:30] look at this also known as a hang-up.
[54:32] How many ever heard that you've got
[54:34] hang-ups? Something that you're dealing
[54:36] with. So, we we want to take this this
[54:39] understanding and we're dealing with the
[54:41] mind. And I know it seems like in some
[54:43] idea ranks of the message, it seems like
[54:45] if you start dealing with the mind,
[54:47] people start running. They they kind of
[54:49] get kind of get afraid. You're you're
[54:51] going to be psychological. Well, I'm
[54:53] just going to go back to the greatest
[54:54] battle ever fought is in your mind. And
[54:57] so, I want to remind and I'm not just
[54:59] taking an isolated quote. I'm taking an
[55:01] entire sermon. And then and then also
[55:04] you can look through the entire message
[55:05] and see that through the prayer lines a
[55:07] lot of times brother Brandham was
[55:08] dealing with those types of situations
[55:10] those hang-ups that people had that
[55:12] could not set them free. They were
[55:13] expecting brother Brandham to do it for
[55:15] them. Just like when someone goes to the
[55:17] church or someone goes to camp meetings
[55:18] or some they're they're expecting that
[55:20] atmosphere or that meeting to change
[55:23] them whereas they come and they have
[55:25] actually built a fortress that they're
[55:28] not aware of. So we really want to tie
[55:31] some key parts of this scripture to our
[55:33] thought. Uh the warning here. If you
[55:36] think you are standing
[55:39] firm, be
[55:41] careful. Speaks to the illusion. Is that
[55:44] just me or is that just you? Is it me?
[55:46] It might be this microphone. If I have
[55:48] to change, I will. I don't want to. You
[55:50] said there's a microphone down
[55:52] here. Let's try this.
[55:56] I feel like I'm exploding everybody out
[55:58] there and I don't want to do that.
[56:07] So, we're got two hands going here. All
[56:10] right, let's try this. So, again, we
[56:12] want to start this. We want to tie this
[56:14] together. The warning, if you think
[56:15] you're standing firm, be
[56:18] careful. Speaks to the illusion of
[56:21] selfsufficiency.
[56:23] I I really want that to sink in of what
[56:25] self-sufficiency is. Now, complexes
[56:28] thrive in blind spots. They're not
[56:31] always out there. They thrive in these
[56:33] blind spots. A blind spot. Now, you
[56:35] understand this in the aspect of
[56:37] driving, but a blind spot is an area in
[56:39] which a person lacks
[56:42] understanding or
[56:44] impartiality or where their view is
[56:46] obstructed. So, even with today's
[56:49] technology, you can be driving down the
[56:51] road and you get so calm and so used to
[56:53] your your your surroundings. You you've
[56:56] seen a car pass by and in your mind
[56:58] you've seen them before, then they pass
[56:59] by you, but you didn't see the other one
[57:01] behind you. They immediately get in that
[57:03] blind spot. You think you're aware of
[57:06] it. You think you're aware of your
[57:07] situation and you begin to move or
[57:09] change direction. And as soon as you
[57:11] change that direction, what do they do?
[57:13] Blare their horn at you. And so a lot of
[57:16] times we find that we we come to a
[57:18] church service or we we get into a
[57:20] situation where we're ready to change.
[57:22] We're ready to make a difference. We're
[57:24] ready to change who we are. We're going
[57:25] to be a better wife. We're going to be a
[57:26] better husband or whatever it may be.
[57:28] And then we we begin to do that. And all
[57:30] of a sudden, here comes the horn.
[57:34] There's a complex that's in that blind
[57:36] spot that's always going to be there to
[57:38] remind you that puts you back into that
[57:40] same situation. And so as we look at
[57:43] this, this truly becomes noticeable with
[57:45] the well, I've already overcome this
[57:47] issue. I've already overcome this. I've
[57:49] already, you know, I've already said
[57:51] that this is an issue. I've already said
[57:52] that this is okay. And we feel that we
[57:54] have taken care of it. But every time we
[57:56] go to make certain moves, the horn is
[57:59] blasted in that blind spot. Now,
[58:02] spiritual or emotional
[58:04] complacency can mask unresolved wounds.
[58:08] How many people actually sit in the
[58:10] service with unresolved wounds? We're
[58:13] talking 10, 20, 30 years and every time
[58:16] something you you know you sit there and
[58:18] especially in services the enemy begins
[58:20] to back up and you don't feel like you
[58:22] felt before as if everything's okay. I
[58:25] don't need need to make a change. I
[58:27] don't need to do these things. But it
[58:29] masks these unresolved wounds. And then
[58:31] we have to admit our dependence for the
[58:35] help or the wounds will never heal.
[58:38] That's right. That's so good. I don't
[58:40] care how much we know of this mess and
[58:42] how much we've been in it, we have to
[58:43] admit our dependency upon his word and
[58:47] that we even need help. In fact, tonight
[58:49] if we don't recognize our own issues,
[58:52] then we will leave with that complex.
[58:55] Oh, I'm jumping ahead. Perhaps you want
[58:57] me to, but I I let's just look real
[59:00] quick at this simple questions and
[59:02] answers here is actually ask brother
[59:04] Brandon. When a person realizes that he
[59:06] has an inferior complex or some sort of
[59:09] complex, how may he overcome this?
[59:13] Should it be if he was the only child
[59:15] causes in his early youth? Now, we can
[59:17] look at that last part, but I really
[59:18] want to focus on that first part. How
[59:20] can he overcome this? Now, the answer is
[59:23] very simple. Take exactly the opposite.
[59:27] That's good. I I want that. Sometimes it
[59:30] seems like it's so simple. Well, if I
[59:32] just keep going to the altar, if I just
[59:33] keep doing the same thing and doing the
[59:35] same thing, well, that that's madness
[59:37] really. Brother Brandham says go the
[59:38] opposite. If you're always wanting your
[59:40] way and that one little, if you don't
[59:43] like this word, he said it. That one
[59:45] little brat that wants and I didn't take
[59:47] it out. So, that one little brat that
[59:50] wants to always have everything your
[59:52] way. You realize sometimes you're
[59:53] actually doing that by holding on to
[59:55] your complex.
[59:57] You have built something in your life
[59:59] and you're actually you think you're in
[1:00:01] control, but you're not in control. Says
[1:00:04] turn right back around and give
[1:00:06] everything you've got the other way. If
[1:00:09] you're selfish and you want to hold
[1:00:11] everything, hold what? All of the past,
[1:00:14] all of those things. You feel like
[1:00:16] you're in control. Listen, I want to
[1:00:18] make it home. I and but I don't want to
[1:00:20] I'm not here to make it by the skin of
[1:00:22] my teeth. I'm not here to to to make it
[1:00:25] wi, you know, with a frown on my face
[1:00:26] and barely getting by and moping and
[1:00:28] groping. The only time I get happy is
[1:00:30] when I have coffee. That's not the way I
[1:00:32] want to live my life. The only time I'm
[1:00:35] happy if if this happens or that right
[1:00:37] song comes on. Listen, that becomes
[1:00:39] emotional and based upon my feelings and
[1:00:42] not upon the word of God. So he says, if
[1:00:44] you're selfish and you want to hold
[1:00:46] everything, then start giving away
[1:00:47] everything you got. You see, do
[1:00:49] whatever. Just go the vice versa, and
[1:00:52] that's the way to overcome. Anything is
[1:00:55] an antidote. Now, I know you already
[1:00:56] read that five times over, but I was
[1:00:58] going to finish it anyways. I I don't
[1:01:00] want to hurt your feelings, but little
[1:01:02] brats turn into big brats.
[1:01:05] Come on now. It's just the way it goes.
[1:01:08] If you don't get it taken care of, you
[1:01:10] become Hey, come on, spouses. You've
[1:01:12] seen it in your own spouse and you've
[1:01:14] seen it in your own self. Sometimes you
[1:01:17] got to have your way and then you begin
[1:01:18] to pout and you begin to mope and then
[1:01:20] the children are this and that. I mean,
[1:01:22] I'm not here to offend. I'm just saying
[1:01:24] if we don't take care of a situation, it
[1:01:27] becomes a complex situation.
[1:01:30] And I don't care how spiritual I am. I
[1:01:32] don't care how many times I've I've read
[1:01:34] the Bible or I've listened to the
[1:01:35] message. If I don't allow God to come
[1:01:39] into my heart and change who I am, I'm
[1:01:42] still going to be what the prophet
[1:01:43] called a brat.
[1:01:46] Now, I'm not giving you the authority,
[1:01:48] young people, to say that word if your
[1:01:49] parents don't like it. I'm not saying
[1:01:51] that. And I'm not calling you that
[1:01:53] either. If you want to leave saying you
[1:01:54] are, that's on your own self. Now, look
[1:01:56] at Saul. Saul's
[1:01:59] insecurity festered.
[1:02:02] Wasn't Saul anointed?
[1:02:05] But the his insecurity festered into
[1:02:07] paranoia
[1:02:09] because he refused to confront his fear
[1:02:13] of inadequacy. Now I know we can
[1:02:15] overspiritualize everything but I want
[1:02:17] to deal with the human element. Listen,
[1:02:20] you can be here and you can have an
[1:02:22] anointing in your life and you can have
[1:02:24] listen you can see visions and dreams
[1:02:26] and all types and be have an anointing
[1:02:28] but Saul with an anointing still got
[1:02:31] paranoid. That's right.
[1:02:35] And he allowed that paranoia to then
[1:02:37] step into, well, I'm going to do it this
[1:02:39] way, and I don't care what anyone says,
[1:02:42] and then I'm going to make the
[1:02:43] decisions. And then God said, you know,
[1:02:45] it's over. You know the story. I'm going
[1:02:46] to turn to someone else.
[1:02:51] Overconfidence blinds us to our
[1:02:54] vulnerabilities.
[1:02:56] We don't, oh, we're not vulnerable.
[1:02:57] We're the bride.
[1:03:01] We're the bride of Jesus Christ. We're
[1:03:02] the we have no
[1:03:05] vulnerabilities. I don't I feel like
[1:03:07] there's a question on how you're taking
[1:03:08] that. You're still a human being. That's
[1:03:11] right. And without and you because of
[1:03:13] that and you're still in the old coat
[1:03:16] and because you are, you have
[1:03:18] vulnerabilities and you need to
[1:03:20] recognize what they are and you need to
[1:03:22] give them to the Lord. And you can't be
[1:03:24] overconfident in yourself. And you can't
[1:03:26] be overconfident in your knowledge. And
[1:03:28] you can't be overconfident in your
[1:03:30] shout. And you can't be overconfident in
[1:03:32] your quietness. You've got to be
[1:03:34] confident in the word and what he says
[1:03:36] for you. That's something you have to
[1:03:38] take. So notice as he got into this
[1:03:40] situation, we find where uh where this
[1:03:42] really begins to play out in this
[1:03:44] situation. It says, "And the women
[1:03:45] answered one another as they played." So
[1:03:48] here we come. They're coming back from
[1:03:49] victory. Can I just put this? They're
[1:03:52] coming back from a a camp.
[1:03:55] de demons were slayed. And I mean, there
[1:03:57] was some there was some good stuff going
[1:03:59] on over here. And the women answered one
[1:04:01] another as they played and said, "Saul
[1:04:03] has slain his thousands. Hey, glory.
[1:04:05] He's slain his thousands." Uh-oh, but
[1:04:08] there's
[1:04:09] more. And David his 10 thousands.
[1:04:13] Well, now if we were in the right frame
[1:04:15] of mind and we were in one mind and one
[1:04:17] accord, we wouldn't care who slayed the
[1:04:20] most.
[1:04:21] we would just be glad that there were
[1:04:23] some demons that were slain cuz it
[1:04:26] doesn't matter how how many it's done as
[1:04:28] long as I can get one soul to Christ.
[1:04:30] But you see Saul in his
[1:04:32] insecurities was very wroth and the
[1:04:36] saying displeased him and they said they
[1:04:39] have ascribed unto David 10 thousands.
[1:04:43] Well, why didn't they say anything about
[1:04:45] my sermon?
[1:04:49] Well, why didn't they say anything about
[1:04:51] my song? Why aren't they saying anything
[1:04:53] about our church? Don't they know we're
[1:04:56] Come on.
[1:04:58] He was He was upset. And they and to me
[1:05:01] they have ascribed but thousands.
[1:05:04] I mean, come on. In that complaint his
[1:05:07] victory. And he was complaining in the
[1:05:09] middle of a victory.
[1:05:12] And what can he have more but the
[1:05:15] kingdom? I mean, here he is. Because of
[1:05:19] his complex,
[1:05:22] because of his paranoia, he lost the
[1:05:25] sight of the true victory. He lost the
[1:05:27] sight of the goal of camp anyways. He
[1:05:30] lost the sight of the goal of church in
[1:05:32] the first place or why we sing or why we
[1:05:34] play music or why we even come to the
[1:05:36] house of God. It has nothing to do with
[1:05:37] Saul. It has nothing to do with David.
[1:05:40] It has nothing to do with even the
[1:05:41] soldiers. is the fact that God gave them
[1:05:44] the authority to have victory.
[1:05:48] And it became a complex situation.
[1:05:51] Oh God, I hope I can get through this
[1:05:53] tonight. And Saul eyed David from that
[1:05:59] day forward. And we're not talking about
[1:06:01] eyeing David, isn't Oh, look at this
[1:06:02] guy. He's great.
[1:06:06] No, I'm going to keep my eye on this
[1:06:08] guy.
[1:06:10] That's good. That's good. see where we
[1:06:12] run into because of these situations. I
[1:06:14] got to keep going. Because of this
[1:06:16] happening, because of this situation,
[1:06:18] let's look further in this. No
[1:06:20] temptation has overtaken you except what
[1:06:24] is common to mankind. So, you're not
[1:06:26] alone in this. Complexes like guilt,
[1:06:29] jealousy,
[1:06:30] inferiority are an ancient human
[1:06:33] struggle. You're not alone.
[1:06:36] You're not the only person that goes
[1:06:38] through this, right? No, this is common.
[1:06:41] but will with the temptation also make a
[1:06:44] way to escape that ye may be able to
[1:06:47] bear it. So listen, you're still I don't
[1:06:49] care how many times you've went to the
[1:06:50] altar, how many times you've went
[1:06:52] through situations, you're still going
[1:06:53] to go through these things, but when you
[1:06:55] give it to the Lord, he will make a way
[1:06:58] through it. The question is is who is
[1:07:01] sitting on the throne in your heart?
[1:07:04] That's what we want to get to. Who is
[1:07:06] sitting on that throne? So you're not
[1:07:08] alone in this. And often God will use
[1:07:10] the ministry to confront the issue.
[1:07:15] That's where the human element begins to
[1:07:17] be like,
[1:07:18] whoa, who is this guy? That's right.
[1:07:22] Well, it's only it's only brother
[1:07:23] brother Sam or brother Brown. I mean, I
[1:07:25] mean, he knows all my
[1:07:26] problems. No one's ever said that. It's
[1:07:30] only brother Nathaniel, right? You've
[1:07:31] never heard that before, brother. You've
[1:07:33] never heard that. You know my
[1:07:35] problems. No. God will use. Notice this.
[1:07:39] Notice even in this situation where
[1:07:40] Nathan confronted David after his
[1:07:44] Basheba moment.
[1:07:46] Well, David had a decision to make.
[1:07:50] And you see a lot of times God will use
[1:07:51] that. Well, then I love even as a
[1:07:53] pastor, I love when when an evangelist
[1:07:55] will come in or a minister will come in
[1:07:57] and I haven't said nothing about the
[1:07:59] problems in the situation and all of a
[1:08:01] sudden he starts going right down the
[1:08:02] line of it. I'm just sit back there
[1:08:04] going, "hm, don't you see what's going
[1:08:05] on?" It's not just because I know it.
[1:08:07] It's God knows it. God knows these
[1:08:10] things. And so you look at this
[1:08:12] situation and you find that David had a
[1:08:14] decision to make. And when God uses that
[1:08:17] ministry or God uses the word, even you
[1:08:20] can turn on a message and listen to the
[1:08:22] message and it's relevant at that
[1:08:24] moment. You open the word of God and
[1:08:27] you're like, I needed that. And
[1:08:29] sometimes it's a spanking. Sometimes
[1:08:31] it's not the joy of the Lord is my
[1:08:32] strength. Sometimes it's like you need
[1:08:34] to get right.
[1:08:36] And then you come to the house of God
[1:08:37] and you come with a worship and an
[1:08:39] atmosphere and everything seems good and
[1:08:41] then all of a sudden the pastor comes
[1:08:43] and he gets right down into your house.
[1:08:47] What is it doing? It's bringing
[1:08:49] selfawareness to your situation.
[1:08:52] We got to quit just looking into the
[1:08:54] clouds and get focused on the the task
[1:08:57] that's at hand. So think about this. So
[1:09:00] we go back to the scripture says
[1:09:01] wherefore my dearly beloved flee from
[1:09:05] idolatry. So what is this speaking of?
[1:09:07] This is dealing with the situations of
[1:09:09] the heart or idols of the heart because
[1:09:12] idolatry is not just pagan statues.
[1:09:16] It's misplaced dependency.
[1:09:21] I want that to be in that in your heart.
[1:09:22] I don't want to just get through it.
[1:09:24] It's misplaced dependency.
[1:09:30] So complexes if we allow them to
[1:09:32] complexes then begin to uh uh we begin
[1:09:36] to idolize them such as the complex of
[1:09:39] control. We want to have control over
[1:09:41] everything or validation or approval.
[1:09:45] It's all right that we want to have some
[1:09:46] sort of control but because we these
[1:09:49] complexes are in our life we start going
[1:09:51] through this then self-reliance or
[1:09:54] resentment uh uh I could just go through
[1:09:57] these quickly. guilt. Comfort zones.
[1:10:01] That's a big one. All of them are big
[1:10:03] actually. But comfort zones because we
[1:10:06] get comfortable with something. We get
[1:10:08] comfortable with one way. It has to be
[1:10:10] this way. It has to be that way. And if
[1:10:12] we don't get it, our whole mood changes.
[1:10:14] I mean, why didn't you cook it the way I
[1:10:16] wanted it to be cooked?
[1:10:18] Then that transfers to the church. Why
[1:10:21] didn't you preach it the way I wanted it
[1:10:22] to be preached? You didn't sing that
[1:10:24] song the way I like it to be sung. And a
[1:10:26] comfort zone becomes something that
[1:10:28] actually we idolize the way we want it
[1:10:31] to be.
[1:10:34] And then it be it takes the the the
[1:10:36] frame of worship.
[1:10:38] And then we've got success. I find so
[1:10:40] many people that the that with the true
[1:10:43] desire to want to support and to do the
[1:10:45] right things, then success becomes their
[1:10:47] idol. Fear becomes an idol. How could
[1:10:49] fear become an idol? But it does. It
[1:10:52] does. And then the the the knowledge
[1:10:54] becomes it. the entitlement. I deserve
[1:10:57] this.
[1:10:59] Listen, we deserve nothing.
[1:11:02] I I'm not trying to put you down
[1:11:03] tonight. I know we fight different sides
[1:11:05] of the spectrum where you got to try to
[1:11:06] get people the balance of bringing them
[1:11:09] back. No, you're not that low. God is
[1:11:11] trying to bring you here, but then we
[1:11:12] got to get the other side over here
[1:11:14] where they're just all up in the clouds
[1:11:15] and we're this and we're that and they
[1:11:17] have no idea really what they are.
[1:11:18] They're just listening to what they're
[1:11:20] being told that they are.
[1:11:22] And we deserve this. We deserve nothing.
[1:11:25] We're not entitled to anything but death
[1:11:27] really when it comes down to it. And
[1:11:29] then, oh my, this one's a tough one. I
[1:11:32] don't I almost should we take that one
[1:11:34] out? No. Because victim mentality is one
[1:11:38] of the biggest things that affect both
[1:11:40] your marriages. It affects the church
[1:11:43] relationships. And you know this
[1:11:44] statement, I don't remember where it
[1:11:46] came from, but hurt people hurt people.
[1:11:49] Yeah.
[1:11:50] Y you don't realize we don't realize
[1:11:52] that we do it, but we were we were
[1:11:54] Listen, I'm not saying that what what
[1:11:56] happened in our past did not hurt, but
[1:11:58] it doesn't entitle us to hurt somebody.
[1:12:01] Listen, then then all of these things
[1:12:03] become a fortress in our life. And we go
[1:12:06] service after service and after service,
[1:12:09] you might even raise your hands and you
[1:12:11] might even sing and you might even uh
[1:12:13] say amen to the word of God. But we
[1:12:15] don't realize that we're actually
[1:12:17] surrounded by our own fortress
[1:12:20] of complexes.
[1:12:23] And so, but what does it Bible tell us
[1:12:25] here? It says that we the weapons of our
[1:12:28] warfare are not carnal. They're not
[1:12:30] worldly, but mighty through God to the
[1:12:33] pulling down of strongholds. Now,
[1:12:36] stepping back a little bit here, the
[1:12:38] word flee, because it says flee
[1:12:39] idolatry, right? means actively
[1:12:42] rejecting patterns that enslave.
[1:12:47] You take the word flee. It's not just
[1:12:49] it's not just sitting there and you know
[1:12:51] how sometimes we get in church and we
[1:12:53] feel like we're willing it. We're just
[1:12:55] like
[1:12:57] No, you have to actively reject it. You
[1:13:01] have to reject the patterns. You know
[1:13:03] the patterns in your life.
[1:13:06] Good. the patterns and the triggers and
[1:13:09] the things that often explode. And these
[1:13:12] often escape notice because they
[1:13:16] masquerade as personality traits.
[1:13:20] This is just my personality. This is the
[1:13:23] reason why I react this way. Get over
[1:13:25] it. This is who I am. Don't you know
[1:13:27] this? And by now, we've expected our
[1:13:29] spouses to just accept it.
[1:13:34] And it's it's my personality. It's who I
[1:13:37] am. It's It's my nature. There's
[1:13:40] scripture for that.
[1:13:44] That's so good. I mean, come on, church.
[1:13:47] Think about this in in a translation
[1:13:49] here. It says the weapons we use in our
[1:13:51] fight. So, it's not just coming to
[1:13:54] church and expecting the pastor or the
[1:13:56] evangelist to fight for you. How many
[1:13:59] went through the prayer lines, brother,
[1:14:01] and expected brother Brandham to do it
[1:14:03] for them? But as soon as they got there,
[1:14:05] they recognized it was put back on them
[1:14:08] to have the faith. It was put back on
[1:14:11] them. But what is that? The think about
[1:14:14] what faith is the substance.
[1:14:18] And these complexes are taking the place
[1:14:21] of our faith. They are the substance
[1:14:24] that is taking our faith away. So we
[1:14:26] come and we have no substance of faith
[1:14:29] and we think that that that prayer will
[1:14:32] fix it for us and we go from service
[1:14:34] after I've seen 20 years, 15 years, two
[1:14:38] years. Hey, listen. One week is enough.
[1:14:43] The weapons we use in our fight are not
[1:14:45] the world's weapons, but God's powerful
[1:14:47] weapons which we use to destroy
[1:14:50] strongholds. We destroy false arguments.
[1:14:54] So these complexes are false arguments
[1:14:58] against the true word of God.
[1:15:01] And you have to you have to fight for
[1:15:03] yourself in this. And what I mean by I
[1:15:06] know the Lord fights our battles. I
[1:15:07] understand that. But he has given you a
[1:15:09] weapon. He's given you his word. He's
[1:15:12] given you the
[1:15:13] authority to resist the devil and flee.
[1:15:17] Not just hope that he goes, but resist
[1:15:20] him. And then we find that we have to
[1:15:22] cast down these imaginations. I know
[1:15:24] you've read this already. And every high
[1:15:26] thing that exaltth itself against the
[1:15:29] knowledge of God and bringing into
[1:15:31] captivity every thought to the obedience
[1:15:34] of Christ. Why? Because you have been
[1:15:36] held captive by these complexes.
[1:15:40] That's so good. They're the ones that's
[1:15:42] been holding you captive. And we cannot
[1:15:44] allow that. what it is. We think about
[1:15:46] the destructive power of these complexes
[1:15:49] distort reality
[1:15:52] and they fuel sin and they will hinder
[1:15:56] your spiritual growth. So true. So it
[1:15:58] distorts the truth
[1:16:01] in our lives. And and I really want us
[1:16:03] to think we are molded and shaped by the
[1:16:06] family we come from. And again this
[1:16:10] brings us to complex situations. Now, I
[1:16:13] know everybody's family's
[1:16:15] perfect, so just let me get through this
[1:16:17] part and spit out the seed, but really,
[1:16:20] we're all born and shaped in iniquity.
[1:16:22] So, we have to fight our past and we
[1:16:25] have to fight. We can't put the blame on
[1:16:27] them. We have to realize that that thing
[1:16:29] is moving through us and we have to
[1:16:31] fight it. And I'm going to bring us a
[1:16:33] and I tried to kind of condense some
[1:16:35] quotes here because God help us tonight
[1:16:37] on getting through this. But it takes
[1:16:39] the power of God to begin to overcome
[1:16:42] this. Now, I like this and I want to
[1:16:44] bring this and I want to read this
[1:16:46] together if we can. Now, Brother
[1:16:48] Brandham uses this. He says, "Now, this
[1:16:50] young fellow's parents, his mother is
[1:16:52] German. No reflection on the German, but
[1:16:55] there is a strain in that family, and
[1:16:57] that is they'll just sit and you can
[1:16:59] talk to them, and they'll just stare you
[1:17:01] right in the face." Now, don't look at
[1:17:03] anybody tonight.
[1:17:06] I know who he's talking
[1:17:08] about. Uh-huh. See this girl's uh uh uh
[1:17:12] sister, the mother of this boy, her
[1:17:14] sister, I have come down the street many
[1:17:17] morning and this young lady be sitting
[1:17:19] out in the yard. I say, "Good morning to
[1:17:20] you." She'd just look at me and I'd stop
[1:17:24] and I'd say, "Sure a fine morning."
[1:17:30] How many's ever done that in the church?
[1:17:32] Oh, yeah.
[1:17:33] and and you thought that they hated your
[1:17:34] guts. Notice Brother Brandham here just
[1:17:37] said, "I just kept trying." And what did
[1:17:39] he put it on? That's just who they are.
[1:17:43] Okay. So, a a surefire morning. She'd
[1:17:45] just stand and look right at you. An
[1:17:47] intelligent woman. I'd say, "Come up and
[1:17:49] see us sometime." She'd just stand and
[1:17:52] look. Well, her brothers are that way.
[1:17:54] Father and mother is that way. Now, the
[1:17:57] father of the boy is strictly an
[1:17:58] Irishman. Moody, hightempered, highrung.
[1:18:02] Again, keep your eyes on the
[1:18:05] quote. This whole family like that
[1:18:07] except one another out of the family or
[1:18:10] one other out of the family
[1:18:13] converted. This father and mother both
[1:18:16] are Christians filled with the Holy
[1:18:17] Ghost and they have brought this young
[1:18:19] man up in the way of the Lord. And now
[1:18:22] the young man is about 17 or 18 years
[1:18:24] old, something along there. Very fine
[1:18:26] kid and has been a real model boy at
[1:18:29] home. Nice kid. and he's got a brother
[1:18:31] that's just vice versa. So here he's
[1:18:34] explaining how one has already been
[1:18:36] changed one but the other being raised
[1:18:38] in the same home, same family, same word
[1:18:41] of God is not that way yet. See, but the
[1:18:45] girls, the mother's family lives close
[1:18:47] to a fine church. But do you think
[1:18:49] they'd ever come over there? No. And
[1:18:52] they know it's right, but it's just not
[1:18:55] in them to ask forgiveness
[1:18:58] or ask pardoning. They just won't do it.
[1:19:01] Notice as I highlighted, it's just not
[1:19:04] in them.
[1:19:07] Now, the genes in the father, I told you
[1:19:08] the quotes long, but we're here, so
[1:19:10] let's get it over. Now, the genes in the
[1:19:12] father and the mother of this boy, no
[1:19:14] matter how much they are converted,
[1:19:16] still remains the flesh that's been
[1:19:19] interbred out of this boy, out to this
[1:19:22] boy. Notice that even the conversion of
[1:19:25] the parents didn't change the fact that
[1:19:27] that young man had to fight that battle.
[1:19:31] So, so you you we can't just look at
[1:19:34] them and just expect that they'll figure
[1:19:36] it out. They need to know fathers what
[1:19:39] you went through. They need to know
[1:19:42] mothers what you went through in a
[1:19:43] sense. I mean, you don't have to bear
[1:19:44] all your dirty secrets. That's not what
[1:19:46] I'm saying. But I'm saying they need to
[1:19:48] understand that family line
[1:19:50] so they will know how to fight it and
[1:19:54] defeat it.
[1:19:56] I I I slowed down here because I want
[1:19:58] you to understand this. We sometimes
[1:19:59] overspiritualize it and just say, "Well,
[1:20:02] if we just lead them to this, they'll
[1:20:04] figure it out." But then that young
[1:20:06] person is fighting it and they think
[1:20:07] they're all alone in it. My mom didn't
[1:20:09] go through this. My dad didn't go
[1:20:11] through this.
[1:20:14] Notice what it said here. Therefore, the
[1:20:16] boy has got a complex in him. Just like
[1:20:18] from his mother's family, and they are
[1:20:21] not forgiving, they will not apologize.
[1:20:23] And that's where the boy stands. Now, I
[1:20:25] said to the father, no matter how much
[1:20:27] you've raised him up, said now look at
[1:20:29] you out of your family. All of them
[1:20:31] drink and fighting, shooting, and
[1:20:32] cutting and so forth. Says, now look at
[1:20:34] your family. To the mother, they're a
[1:20:36] bunch of people just sit there and won't
[1:20:38] speak. Very independent and so forth,
[1:20:40] irreverent to religion. But I said, it's
[1:20:42] not you. You're the only one of all your
[1:20:46] sisters and brothers and you are sweet,
[1:20:48] kind, and forgiving. What does that and
[1:20:52] your tree, part of that family tree, you
[1:20:55] yet you have received the Holy Ghost. He
[1:20:58] said you're part of that same family
[1:20:59] tree. But the difference is is you
[1:21:01] received the Holy Ghost.
[1:21:04] That's the thing that made you tender
[1:21:05] and sweet. It's not your people anymore.
[1:21:08] It's your Christ that lives in you.
[1:21:13] That's what we're trying to lead us to
[1:21:15] is lead it into you. And I said to the
[1:21:17] boy, "Look at your family. Practically
[1:21:18] all of them are drunks and so forth." I
[1:21:20] said, "And how moody and hightempered
[1:21:22] and highrung, but you're not. You're
[1:21:24] kind, forgiving. What is it?" The Holy
[1:21:26] Spirit. You're no more what you are.
[1:21:29] It's Christ in you. And I said, I said,
[1:21:31] "Now that same thing has to happen to
[1:21:34] your son."
[1:21:37] Last part of this quote, this is very
[1:21:38] important. And the father raised up and
[1:21:41] said, "My son went to the altar. He was
[1:21:43] baptized correctly in the name of Jesus
[1:21:45] Christ." And water baptism in the pool
[1:21:47] said, "I know my son has come to
[1:21:49] Christ." Notice the answer. I said,
[1:21:51] "That may be all right." All the outward
[1:21:53] emotions or motions, he might be
[1:21:56] identified as a believer with the
[1:21:59] believers. But until he is regenerated,
[1:22:03] born again, I'd advise that young man to
[1:22:06] never marry a woman. He'll make hell on
[1:22:09] earth for her until that gentle, sweet,
[1:22:12] forgiving spirit of Christ comes in.
[1:22:16] Then that will be a paradox in itself to
[1:22:18] take the very nature of a boy that's
[1:22:20] bred between father and mother. And yet
[1:22:23] in his intellectuals, he is trying his
[1:22:26] best to overcome it.
[1:22:29] He can't do it. He'll never overcome it.
[1:22:32] Christ will have to overcome it. When he
[1:22:34] lets Christ in, oh brothers and sisters,
[1:22:37] you got to understand this. You've got
[1:22:38] to let him in. Then he's already
[1:22:41] overcome. Then it'll be a perfect
[1:22:42] paradox. When a man is born of the
[1:22:45] spirit of God, go back just a little bit
[1:22:47] of what he said. He said, "I advise that
[1:22:49] he not marry
[1:22:52] until it's taken care of."
[1:22:55] Why is it wrong to teach that?
[1:22:58] Is it wrong to let them? Because listen,
[1:23:00] marriage will not fix it for you.
[1:23:04] Because then you get married and you
[1:23:05] think, "Well, it's not working. Maybe if
[1:23:07] we have kids, it'll it'll it'll settle
[1:23:09] us down." No, now you're bringing the
[1:23:11] kids into the situation.
[1:23:14] And then we go to the pastor that's
[1:23:15] tried to encourage and help you along
[1:23:17] the way, and we're boohooing and crying
[1:23:19] about our situation. He's like, "Why
[1:23:20] didn't you listen to the Holy Spirit
[1:23:22] some years ago?" See, that's why we've
[1:23:25] got to come to this realization. We need
[1:23:27] a change in our lives. A regeneration.
[1:23:30] Marriage will not fix it. children will
[1:23:32] not fix it. A different grasp will not
[1:23:34] fix it for you. You've got to come to
[1:23:37] God yourself.
[1:23:40] Oh God, help us to do that. So you and I
[1:23:42] will never overcome this complex on our
[1:23:45] own because these are strongholds. These
[1:23:48] strongholds are psychological, spiritual
[1:23:51] complexes. And strongholds are
[1:23:53] entrenched patterns. They're entrenched
[1:23:56] patterns of thought, belief, or behavior
[1:24:00] that opposes God's truth. They're
[1:24:03] entrenched in your life.
[1:24:05] So, I want that to really sink in.
[1:24:07] Complexes become mental
[1:24:10] fortresses requiring supernatural
[1:24:13] strategy. Absolutely. Absolutely. This
[1:24:15] is a mental fortress in our life that is
[1:24:17] not just overcome in a sense. Now I
[1:24:20] believe at any moment that if you are uh
[1:24:22] uh honest with God even sitting in your
[1:24:25] pew tonight if you hear the word I mean
[1:24:27] the go back to the book of Acts and they
[1:24:29] were pricricked in their heart from what
[1:24:31] the word being preached they didn't have
[1:24:33] to wait to the end they were pricricked
[1:24:35] in their heart let the word do the
[1:24:37] change let the word do the pricking oh
[1:24:40] God help us to understand that so we
[1:24:42] think of these things in our life and
[1:24:44] and these uh these strongholds that
[1:24:46] entrench patterns and and what it does
[1:24:48] is it keeps the husband not being able
[1:24:50] to be honest with the wife and the wife
[1:24:52] not being able to be honest and we can't
[1:24:54] be honest in church that these things
[1:24:56] are tearing us down.
[1:25:00] Oh God help us with this to work in the
[1:25:03] process of the destruction of these
[1:25:04] strongholds. You have to identify that
[1:25:07] lie. That's so good. You need to
[1:25:11] identify that lie. Well, I've been in
[1:25:13] this for so long. I don't have anything.
[1:25:15] Listen, we don't You ever just had
[1:25:17] something rise up? Even in the middle of
[1:25:18] a service, something just kind of rise
[1:25:21] up in you and you're just like, "What is
[1:25:22] that odd feeling?" That could be a
[1:25:24] complex, right? It could be something
[1:25:26] that'll rise up and or maybe you hear a
[1:25:28] name or you hear of a situation and it
[1:25:31] begins to rise up and then it changes
[1:25:32] the spirit. It changes the atmosphere.
[1:25:36] You've got to identify the lie and you
[1:25:38] cannot hold on to them no matter how
[1:25:41] true they may seem. Amen. Notice you've
[1:25:45] got to bring it to light. But all things
[1:25:48] that are reproved are made manifest by
[1:25:51] the light. For whatsoever doth make
[1:25:54] manifest is light. In this translation
[1:25:56] you and when all things are brought out
[1:25:58] to the light, then their true nature is
[1:26:03] clearly revealed. What is the true
[1:26:05] nature of what we're holding on to?
[1:26:09] Even the prophet himself built up a
[1:26:11] complex
[1:26:13] simply by his desire to help people.
[1:26:17] So from a good thing, he built up a
[1:26:20] complex. I didn't have the quote down,
[1:26:22] but you can go search it out. He he says
[1:26:24] it straight up. His desire to help
[1:26:26] people. He lost feeling for them. Even
[1:26:29] at time got frustrated and had to stop
[1:26:31] preaching, angry that they would not
[1:26:34] heed the message.
[1:26:38] I'm so glad that we had a prophet that
[1:26:39] was transparent.
[1:26:41] Yes, sir. I I don't know why we have to
[1:26:44] put this facade that we're perfect and
[1:26:46] that we're the best and that we're this.
[1:26:47] No, we are human beings that need God.
[1:26:51] We have no problem with asking for
[1:26:52] prayer because of a heart condition or
[1:26:54] this. But when what about the battles of
[1:26:56] the mind? It's like that's taboo. We
[1:26:58] can't we can't Oh, man. You you've got a
[1:27:00] problem. We all have problems. Even the
[1:27:04] prophet of God admitted he needed
[1:27:05] something in his life. He needed a
[1:27:07] change. He had built up that complex. We
[1:27:10] can be in this for years and years and
[1:27:12] build up a complex by just trying to do
[1:27:14] good.
[1:27:17] And complexes thrive in secrecy.
[1:27:21] Absolutely. And self-reliance.
[1:27:23] Absolutely. Yes, sir. Now, I this was a
[1:27:26] long quote, so I condensed this just to
[1:27:29] bring this. In the sermon, An uncertain
[1:27:31] sound, brother Brandham shared the
[1:27:33] inspiring story about a lady named
[1:27:35] Margaret. A bright and beautiful
[1:27:38] 18-year-old girl was faced with a severe
[1:27:40] mental health
[1:27:42] crisis. Despite her intelligence and
[1:27:45] deep faith, the pressure from her peers,
[1:27:47] now her her sister was firm on the word.
[1:27:51] Basically said, I don't care what they
[1:27:53] say. I think I think it was even said
[1:27:54] they can just go basically jump in the
[1:27:56] lake. I'm going to serve my God. But yet
[1:28:00] she, this young lady raised in the same
[1:28:02] family, built up a complex because of
[1:28:06] that peer pressure. Well, why aren't you
[1:28:08] like us? Why won't you do this and why
[1:28:10] won't you do that? And just the
[1:28:13] simplicity of peer pressure, she built
[1:28:16] up a complex that put her in an
[1:28:18] institution for two years. And by the
[1:28:22] time the news got to brother Brandham,
[1:28:24] you remember brother Brandham said it
[1:28:25] was an old girlfriend of his and it was
[1:28:27] her daughter. And by the time it had got
[1:28:29] to her, they said that I believe the
[1:28:31] next day, I'm going to say Monday
[1:28:32] perhaps, I could be wrong on that, but
[1:28:34] by the next day, they were going to move
[1:28:35] her into a padded facility where
[1:28:38] basically would be no hope for her. And
[1:28:40] so, Brother Brandham goes there and as
[1:28:42] he as he goes to that situation and he
[1:28:44] walks into that room and he begins to
[1:28:46] talk to her, nothing would change. And
[1:28:48] he kept saying, "God, I mean, basically,
[1:28:50] unless you come in, I can't do anything
[1:28:52] about this." Then all of a sudden he
[1:28:55] remembered uh uh whether God began to
[1:28:57] deal with him about this that she always
[1:29:00] wanted to marry a preacher.
[1:29:03] And when he spoke to her about that
[1:29:05] desire that was in her heart, something
[1:29:08] came in the room
[1:29:11] and changed and said, "Thus saith the
[1:29:14] Lord, it's over."
[1:29:16] Miraculously, now after that moment,
[1:29:18] he's like, "Why did I say this? Why did
[1:29:20] I say that?" just by going into the
[1:29:23] desire of her heart for a godly thing.
[1:29:26] It broke through a
[1:29:29] 2year situation, a complex, and within
[1:29:32] the end of that day, I believe it was
[1:29:34] the end of that day, Brother Huff called
[1:29:36] and said, "Listen, we're we're taking
[1:29:38] her home. It's already done." Now, my
[1:29:41] question is, is how did a pretty
[1:29:44] 18-year-old get into that condition?
[1:29:48] It started with a little complex.
[1:29:52] that turned into a fortress.
[1:29:56] And we don't realize and I want us to
[1:29:58] really think about this. This is just a
[1:30:00] I I want this to be put into our mind of
[1:30:03] a complex and we build just by the
[1:30:06] simple complex or pressure otherwise or
[1:30:10] what I mean is the pressure of being
[1:30:12] questioned of why you believe this why
[1:30:14] won't you do this and why won't you be
[1:30:15] that it built up in her by that complex
[1:30:18] and within two now you don't have to be
[1:30:19] in an insane asylum
[1:30:22] to be in this condition
[1:30:25] that's good I I want that to really sink
[1:30:27] in you don't have to well thank God I'm
[1:30:28] not in to say I'm
[1:30:31] okay. No.
[1:30:34] You might have this right now.
[1:30:38] So, let this really come
[1:30:40] in. Many times people build these
[1:30:43] fortresses thinking it is a protection.
[1:30:47] But quite literally, they have done the
[1:30:49] enemy's work and sieged themselves.
[1:30:54] I'm going to protect myself. I'm going
[1:30:56] to keep arms linked. I'm going to do
[1:30:57] this. I'm going to but what you've
[1:30:58] actually done is you've done the enemy's
[1:31:01] work. And so this metaphor of a mental
[1:31:03] fortress captures the entrenched defense
[1:31:07] nature of psychological complexes. And
[1:31:10] these strongholds are not passive
[1:31:12] quirks, but the active systems. They're
[1:31:15] active systems of thought, emotion, and
[1:31:18] behavior that resist truth and preserve
[1:31:23] bondage. So you're literally going
[1:31:26] against the word of God thinking you're
[1:31:28] protecting yourself and so you have
[1:31:30] entrenched yourself in this complex of I
[1:31:34] was victimized by this situation and I
[1:31:36] don't want to allow myself to go through
[1:31:38] that again so I'm going to protect
[1:31:40] myself and what you've done is you have
[1:31:42] built your own fortress.
[1:31:47] That's good. God help us to understand
[1:31:49] this. So what is the architecture of a
[1:31:52] mental fortress? Is this okay on time? I
[1:31:54] I don't know where we're at. What is the
[1:31:57] architecture of a mental fortress? So,
[1:32:00] we think about this. It is a complex uh
[1:32:03] or a complex operates like a castle
[1:32:06] built to protect lies.
[1:32:09] And then the walls. So, what are the
[1:32:11] walls? Walls are core false beliefs such
[1:32:15] as I must be
[1:32:17] loved. I'm inherently unworthy.
[1:32:21] They're false beliefs. These are walls
[1:32:23] that I mean, they're false beliefs of
[1:32:25] something that you need, something
[1:32:27] that's there, and you build it off. I
[1:32:29] I'm unworthy. I I got to be loved. And
[1:32:31] and and so I'm going to protect myself.
[1:32:33] I I don't want to ever be hurt like that
[1:32:35] again. And so we build up these walls of
[1:32:38] false beliefs. And then the moes that
[1:32:40] are around it, that waterway is
[1:32:42] defensive behaviors such as avoidance,
[1:32:46] people pleasing, and addiction. Right?
[1:32:49] People turn to addiction and they don't
[1:32:50] realize that even in the well, I'm not
[1:32:52] out there doing worldly things, but yet
[1:32:54] we have an addiction in our life.
[1:32:57] Something that uh that keeps us to avoid
[1:33:01] that situation again. We we want we we
[1:33:04] literally bury our head in the sand, not
[1:33:07] willing because we don't want to get
[1:33:08] hurt again. So, we've dug it around us.
[1:33:11] I'm not going to let people I'm not
[1:33:12] going to let this happen again. And and
[1:33:14] then we become people pleasers. We're
[1:33:15] not truly honest. We're just whatever
[1:33:18] somebody wants me to do, I'm going to do
[1:33:19] that. All right. And it's a def and
[1:33:22] they're defensive behaviors. And then we
[1:33:24] have the guard towers. And these are
[1:33:26] triggers that reinforce the complex such
[1:33:30] as FOMO. You know what that is? Fear of
[1:33:32] missing out or fear of being left out.
[1:33:35] They left me out.
[1:33:38] And so now because of that, I've been
[1:33:41] triggered. Message people don't get
[1:33:44] triggered. Either that or you're full
[1:33:46] triggered
[1:33:48] tonight or simply mistaken perception.
[1:33:54] You thought they said something, but
[1:33:55] they actually didn't say that. You
[1:33:58] thought that they meant it this way, but
[1:33:59] it was actually because you're in this
[1:34:02] castle. You're in this fortress that you
[1:34:04] built.
[1:34:06] Well, that's what they meant.
[1:34:12] You know, every fortress has to have a
[1:34:14] ruler.
[1:34:16] That's good preaching.
[1:34:18] What's
[1:34:19] sitting in the middle of our fortress
[1:34:22] ruling us?
[1:34:25] See, what is this? If we if we really
[1:34:27] look at this a ruler, a root sin or
[1:34:31] wound such as pride, fear, rejection
[1:34:34] that governs it.
[1:34:36] I'm not going to allow myself to be
[1:34:37] hurt. So this pride begins to rule our
[1:34:41] life. It be and it's sitting there in
[1:34:43] the heart of our fortress in the heart
[1:34:45] here and it's sitting on that throne and
[1:34:47] it governs our reactions. It listen
[1:34:50] we'll be we could be okay for two weeks
[1:34:52] and then all of a sudden something will
[1:34:53] happen that'll trigger it. I mean I'll
[1:34:55] even be as simple as this. You've ever
[1:34:57] been you ever sitting in your home on
[1:34:59] your easy chair or recliner or whatever
[1:35:01] it is and everything is okay. You had a
[1:35:04] good day. Uh, the the food was good. The
[1:35:07] laundry's done. I'm I'm dealing with
[1:35:09] both sides here. The laundry's done. The
[1:35:11] kids didn't back talk. The grandkids
[1:35:13] were great.
[1:35:15] That's good. You actually had a good day
[1:35:18] at work. And you're sitting there and
[1:35:20] you're, "Oh, thank the Lord for all
[1:35:21] that." And all of a sudden, thought
[1:35:23] comes
[1:35:24] and it triggers. And within five
[1:35:27] minutes, you're fuming. Yeah. and your
[1:35:30] wife or spouse who 10 minutes ago was
[1:35:33] like, "Man, this is a great evening."
[1:35:35] Comes in. This is the right time to ask
[1:35:37] him or her a
[1:35:39] question and they come right in there
[1:35:42] because it's been great. And they ask a
[1:35:44] question like, "What do you mean? Wait a
[1:35:46] minute. What just happened here?
[1:35:47] Everything was okay 10 minutes ago.
[1:35:50] We got something in our mind
[1:35:53] because listen, peace hasn't been ruling
[1:35:55] in our heart. I want that. Oh God, help
[1:35:58] us understand it's otherwise saying
[1:36:01] pride or self-identity or selfworth. So
[1:36:04] think of the scripture that that comes
[1:36:06] here. Pride goeth before destruction and
[1:36:08] a hotty spirit before a fall. What is it
[1:36:11] saying that it is leading you to
[1:36:13] destruction? Self-identity, self-worth.
[1:36:16] I have to identify this way. I have to
[1:36:18] react this way. This is how people
[1:36:20] expect me to do. I'm from the north. I'm
[1:36:23] from the south. I'm from the east. I'm
[1:36:24] from the west. And that's the way
[1:36:26] everyone expects me to be. Listen,
[1:36:28] brother Brandham talked about going to
[1:36:29] different parts of the states. It's like
[1:36:30] it's a different country. Amen.
[1:36:37] But that's okay. We can be different.
[1:36:40] And not be against.
[1:36:42] But no, because if we're not careful,
[1:36:44] pride or fear or rejection is actually
[1:36:47] sitting in the
[1:36:49] heart in that throne and it rules us.
[1:36:52] Right? So, if we can expose the true
[1:36:56] nature of this issue, then we can break
[1:36:58] these walls down.
[1:37:00] Because you realize that complexes
[1:37:02] actually keep people from church. That's
[1:37:04] right. Complexes keep people from the
[1:37:07] house of God. So, and so, and they
[1:37:09] literally get sick.
[1:37:12] That's good. Yeah. Yes, sir. I I know
[1:37:15] what it's like that that complex. Well,
[1:37:17] I mean, brother, I'm just going to use
[1:37:19] you because this is your church. I mean,
[1:37:22] I I mean, brother Sam said this and and
[1:37:25] I just can't believe that he said that.
[1:37:26] I'm not feeling well tonight.
[1:37:32] I had a brother say this and this is so
[1:37:34] true. The more you miss, the easier it
[1:37:36] becomes.
[1:37:38] True. It hurts at first,
[1:37:41] but the more the easier it is. And so it
[1:37:45] keeps us from it. But your human weapon
[1:37:47] is not adequate to beat this fortress.
[1:37:49] So moralism won't do it.
[1:37:52] Well, if I try harder, I will be try
[1:37:55] harder to be good. What does trying
[1:37:56] harder to be good do? It ignores the
[1:37:59] heart's idolatry.
[1:38:01] And we are there trying to push down
[1:38:03] these walls with our good deeds and our
[1:38:06] messagisms.
[1:38:09] I'm not against you. I I don't think I
[1:38:11] need to fix that.
[1:38:15] If you didn't catch that, I I pray for
[1:38:17] you.
[1:38:20] But we we can't just fix it with our
[1:38:22] good deeds and and trying to be better
[1:38:23] and all of these things because it
[1:38:25] doesn't work. This idea of trying harder
[1:38:28] to be good, it ignores it. Notice what
[1:38:30] 1st Samuel 15:20. Oh, I done messed up
[1:38:32] and went to the earth. Well, that's
[1:38:33] okay. And Samuel said, "Hath the Lord is
[1:38:36] great delight in burnt offerings and
[1:38:37] sacrifices as in obeying the voice of
[1:38:40] the Lord. Behold, to obey is better than
[1:38:43] sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat
[1:38:45] of rans." Because what do we bring to
[1:38:47] God all the time? Hey, I went to church.
[1:38:50] I turned on a message today. I listened
[1:38:53] to good songs. I listened to good music.
[1:38:55] And we be we we begin to bring our
[1:38:58] sacrifice because I guess it's a
[1:39:02] sacrifice to come to church.
[1:39:06] Take that as you will. I get it. It's
[1:39:08] our sacrifice, but come on. It's not
[1:39:10] that type of sacrifice
[1:39:13] to listen to the message of the hour to
[1:39:15] open up the word of God to to come to
[1:39:18] the house of God and to worship him in
[1:39:20] spirit and in truth. And I get it. Not
[1:39:21] every service is going to hit a home
[1:39:23] run.
[1:39:26] Your pastor goes through battles, too.
[1:39:29] Maybe. Yeah. He said, "Yeah, I didn't
[1:39:31] even have to ask him."
[1:39:34] Hallelujah.
[1:39:35] [Music]
[1:39:37] earthly strategies, willpower, therapy,
[1:39:40] distraction often attack them, but those
[1:39:44] those they attack the moes and the
[1:39:46] towers, but they still will leave the
[1:39:48] fortress intact. It's like putting Advil
[1:39:50] on a headache. Well, you feel good for a
[1:39:53] little bit. Come to the house of God.
[1:39:55] Good atmosphere, good presence. Man, I'm
[1:39:58] feeling pretty good, brother. You sung
[1:40:00] that song right. I actually enjoyed it
[1:40:02] this time.
[1:40:05] popped the
[1:40:06] Advil. By the time they got home, the
[1:40:08] tires were screeching, the Warhawks were
[1:40:10] flying, and the kids were running.
[1:40:13] [Applause]
[1:40:16] Advil wore off. It's apparently not
[1:40:18] extra
[1:40:19] strength. What are you doing? You cannot
[1:40:22] bring it by your moralism, by your good
[1:40:24] deeds. You have to have a true
[1:40:26] conversion.
[1:40:28] Oh my. I want that to really sink in our
[1:40:30] heart. And look at this quote. It says
[1:40:31] there's a little place in the heart that
[1:40:33] nothing will fill it but God. And man is
[1:40:36] thirsting for something and that real
[1:40:38] thirst is for God. Listen, pride ain't
[1:40:40] going to do it. Uh fear ain't going to
[1:40:42] do it. All of those things aren't going
[1:40:44] to do it. It's not going to fill it up.
[1:40:45] And nobody's got a right to quench that
[1:40:47] Holy Spirit thirst with giving it to the
[1:40:50] devil for the things of this world.
[1:40:52] You've got no right trying to hide that
[1:40:54] thirst by joining a church. God's the
[1:40:57] only thing that'll fill that up. Well,
[1:40:59] oh, praise God. I don't have to go to
[1:41:00] church anymore. That's not what he said.
[1:41:04] It's not enough, brothers and sisters.
[1:41:06] God's the only thing that'll fill up
[1:41:07] God. The Holy Spirit is the only thing
[1:41:10] that can satisfy that thirst. And Jesus
[1:41:12] said, "Blessed are they that do hunger
[1:41:14] and thirst for righteousness." And it's
[1:41:17] God trying to get to the human heart.
[1:41:22] Oh, God help us. And the devil tries to
[1:41:24] quench that by letting them drink
[1:41:26] theirelves to death or run themselves to
[1:41:28] death or do something else. But God
[1:41:30] created man to have that holy thirst.
[1:41:33] And if you won't take God, then you'll
[1:41:35] have to take something else to kind of
[1:41:38] appease
[1:41:40] that calling. And that's what makes a
[1:41:43] man that way. See, God made him to be a
[1:41:45] king. God wants to set on your heart's
[1:41:49] throne. And you've got no right to let
[1:41:52] the devil put the put the things of his
[1:41:54] makings in you. been led. And let me say
[1:41:56] this, there's nothing that will satisfy
[1:41:59] it. He's being repetitious here. For
[1:42:01] those that don't like
[1:42:03] repetition, there's nothing that will
[1:42:06] satisfy it. But God, you can do what you
[1:42:09] want to drink yourself crazy, but you'll
[1:42:11] never satisfy until Christ takes his
[1:42:14] place in that human heart.
[1:42:19] So, what am I here to do? Listen, he's
[1:42:20] not just wanting you to look the part,
[1:42:24] but he desires all of you. A personal
[1:42:27] relationship that is built from a heart
[1:42:30] of worship and not an act of worship.
[1:42:34] He's not wanting you to act tonight.
[1:42:36] He's looking for your heart. Do you
[1:42:38] think about it? The phrase heart of
[1:42:40] worship refers to a profound and
[1:42:43] intimate connection with God where
[1:42:45] worship goes beyond ritualistic
[1:42:48] practices and evolves into a way of
[1:42:51] life. So it's not just here I'm going to
[1:42:53] put on an act of worship tonight to make
[1:42:55] people think that I'm okay. But it is a
[1:42:58] life of worship. It is a life a personal
[1:43:01] relationship that goes beyond where your
[1:43:03] worship is not uh uh decided upon your
[1:43:07] circumstance. That's right. So what does
[1:43:10] it do? It involves it. It emphasizes the
[1:43:12] importance of the motivations and
[1:43:15] methods behind our actions rather than
[1:43:17] solely focusing on the actions
[1:43:20] themselves. So you're worshiping, but
[1:43:22] why? There you go. You're here, but why?
[1:43:27] You listen to a message, but why? You're
[1:43:29] studying, but why? You need to know your
[1:43:33] motivation behind it. God, help us to
[1:43:36] keep our motivation in the heart. So,
[1:43:38] you've got to go beyond the idea of
[1:43:40] having self-help or just believe in
[1:43:42] yourself. Oh, believe in yourself
[1:43:44] because believing in yourself alone
[1:43:46] reinforces the reinforces the lie that
[1:43:50] we're self-sufficient. So, I don't want
[1:43:52] you to just believe that you can do it
[1:43:54] tonight. You need to believe what the
[1:43:55] word said about you. And the only way
[1:43:58] you can do that is it is expose the lie
[1:44:01] that's been in your heart so long that
[1:44:03] created that fortress and go beyond
[1:44:06] believing in yourself. Because how many
[1:44:08] people go home after a service believing
[1:44:10] that they'll do it.
[1:44:13] I believe I can. I believe I can. But
[1:44:16] what do we find? We've got to trust in
[1:44:18] the Lord with all thine heart and lean
[1:44:21] not unto thine own understanding. and in
[1:44:23] all thy ways acknowledge him and he will
[1:44:26] direct thy paths. Be not wise in thine
[1:44:29] own eyes. Fear the Lord and depart from
[1:44:32] evil. So what this is doing is this
[1:44:34] causes people to turn worldly thing to
[1:44:37] worldly things. When they have
[1:44:40] selfbelief then they turn to worldly
[1:44:42] things to help drown out the struggles
[1:44:46] thinking it is helping them but it is
[1:44:48] actually taking them further from God.
[1:44:51] And it's not always bad things because
[1:44:53] we'll sit here and think, well, I'm not
[1:44:54] doing this bad thing and this bad thing.
[1:44:56] But anything that takes the place of God
[1:44:59] is that worldly thing. Then we turn into
[1:45:02] this other idea of avoidance which is
[1:45:05] numbing pain and it entrenches that
[1:45:08] stronghold. If I can just keep myself
[1:45:10] busy or into things, it's going to help.
[1:45:14] I'm going to run from my problems. I'm
[1:45:15] going to keep myself in my work. I'm
[1:45:17] going to keep myself in my home duties.
[1:45:18] I'm going to keep myself in this. and
[1:45:20] we're constantly running from the
[1:45:22] situation trying to numb the pain and
[1:45:25] we'll never fix it. But notice what it
[1:45:27] says here. Be careful about nothing. But
[1:45:29] in everything by prayer and supplication
[1:45:31] with thanksgiving, let your requests be
[1:45:34] made known unto God. So you need to get
[1:45:35] honest with God tonight.
[1:45:39] Like the old song that I I love to sing,
[1:45:41] no more pretending. I can look good when
[1:45:43] I want
[1:45:44] to. That's what that song says. I can
[1:45:47] look good when I want to. I I know the
[1:45:49] right things to say. I can cover up what
[1:45:51] I don't want you to see, but he sees it
[1:45:53] anyway. Maybe I think I can fool you.
[1:45:56] Maybe I'm fooling myself. I've got to
[1:45:58] change. And I don't know how, and I need
[1:46:01] your help. No more pretending.
[1:46:05] That's what we've got to come to this
[1:46:06] understanding. I can't pretend anymore.
[1:46:08] I need to give everything to him. I I
[1:46:10] don't want to just keep myself busy. I
[1:46:12] want to give everything to him. So, what
[1:46:14] do we have to do? We have to begin to
[1:46:17] lay siege to the enemy. The enemy's laid
[1:46:20] siege to us. We did it ourselves. We
[1:46:23] sieged ourselves in our complex. We kept
[1:46:26] ourselves out of anything the Holy
[1:46:28] Spirit could do for us.
[1:46:31] And now it's got a time to turn the
[1:46:32] tide. We need to lay siege to these
[1:46:35] complexes in our life. And what is the
[1:46:37] way? What is a what what can we do? The
[1:46:39] Holy Spirit is a military specialist.
[1:46:43] There you go.
[1:46:44] The spirit infiltrates the heart,
[1:46:47] dismantling strongholds through
[1:46:49] conviction and renewal. We're not here
[1:46:52] to condemn anybody because we've all
[1:46:54] been here. But we've got to let that
[1:46:56] Holy Spirit break through our heart and
[1:46:58] infiltrate that. So what so we must have
[1:47:02] open hearts. How how can we say this?
[1:47:04] Look what David did after all he did.
[1:47:06] Search me, oh God, and know my heart.
[1:47:09] Try me and know my thoughts and see if
[1:47:11] there be any wicked way in me. and lead
[1:47:14] me in the way of everlasting. You think,
[1:47:16] well, God already knows. He does, but he
[1:47:18] wants you to be honest with him. He
[1:47:20] listen, he's a gentleman.
[1:47:22] He's not forcing himself on you. This is
[1:47:25] not fear tactics. This is not making you
[1:47:27] run to an altar. This is making you want
[1:47:29] God because you want to be over. Not
[1:47:32] just because you're tired of the
[1:47:33] problems, not just because you're tired
[1:47:34] of those things, but you love him. You
[1:47:37] fall in love with Jesus over and over
[1:47:40] again. And no matter what happens, you
[1:47:43] will leave this place knowing I'm going
[1:47:44] to face battles. I'm going to face
[1:47:46] trials. You know, somebody may step on
[1:47:48] my toes. Somebody may look at me wrong.
[1:47:51] Somebody may say something that will
[1:47:53] offend me. But you know what? I'm not
[1:47:55] going to let it get me anymore.
[1:47:57] Why? Because you've let the Holy Spirit
[1:48:00] come in your heart. And so, what do you
[1:48:03] begin to do? You begin to use these
[1:48:05] things. Uh uh and I really want this to
[1:48:08] to to die in in our or dive in in our
[1:48:11] heart. We have to expose those lies with
[1:48:14] scripture. So we look at David and David
[1:48:17] countered guilt with repentance grounded
[1:48:20] in God's character. That's good. He
[1:48:23] encountered that guilt. He didn't run
[1:48:25] from it, right? He did not run from it.
[1:48:29] He did not run from it. I'll say it
[1:48:30] again. He did not run from it, but he
[1:48:32] encountered Yes, he made mistakes.
[1:48:35] You remember when he was questioned and
[1:48:37] and the prophet comes out and he says,
[1:48:39] you know, uh uh after the the Bath Sheba
[1:48:42] situation and the prophet basically
[1:48:45] reeled him in.
[1:48:47] [Music]
[1:48:48] That's right. That man deserves to die.
[1:48:52] Oh, how many times have we done that?
[1:48:57] Thou art the man.
[1:49:00] Talk about a turn of events.
[1:49:04] But notice whenever he did
[1:49:06] this, and we can we can go in all
[1:49:08] different situations, but this scripture
[1:49:10] means something. Create in me a clean
[1:49:12] heart. Listen, I don't want to just have
[1:49:16] a white wall, this this
[1:49:18] fortress. I want you to create in me a
[1:49:21] clean heart, oh God, and renew a right
[1:49:25] spirit within me. Cast me not away from
[1:49:27] thy presence, and take not thy holy
[1:49:28] spirit from me. Restore unto me the joy
[1:49:32] of thy salvation and hold uphold me with
[1:49:35] thy free spirit. You have to identify
[1:49:38] those lies and encounter them with a
[1:49:42] truth such as a lie. I'm all alone.
[1:49:45] Nobody's there with me. Encounter it
[1:49:46] with the promise where Hebrews 13:5
[1:49:49] says, "I will never leave you nor
[1:49:50] forsake you." You've just encountered a
[1:49:53] lie with a truth. That's why you we want
[1:49:55] you to study the word of God and not
[1:49:57] just wait for the pastor or the
[1:49:59] evangelist to bring it for you. You
[1:50:00] study it so you can encounter those lies
[1:50:03] in your life with that truth. Amen. Oh
[1:50:06] God, I want that to sink in. Search us,
[1:50:09] Lord. And so as we begin to look at this
[1:50:11] situation uh we begin to see uh as we've
[1:50:14] already read this this scripture about
[1:50:16] search me, oh God, but lies begin to
[1:50:19] collapse when deprived of mental
[1:50:22] supplies. The more we supply those
[1:50:25] things, the more we fuel that lie. But
[1:50:28] when we siege that lie with the truth,
[1:50:30] that lie begins to collapse. So when you
[1:50:33] come back to the heart of worship, we
[1:50:36] begin to use worship as a trench buster.
[1:50:40] Not just an act, you can look the part,
[1:50:43] but if there's no heart there, are you
[1:50:45] really breaking down those walls?
[1:50:48] Because what does true praise do? True
[1:50:50] praise shifts the focus from the
[1:50:53] fortress to God's supremacy.
[1:50:56] When you actually, and I'm not just
[1:50:58] talking about acting it out. I'm talking
[1:51:01] about true worship. Worship in your car,
[1:51:05] worship in your home. You don't even
[1:51:07] have to have a sound of a note.
[1:51:10] When was the last time you were driving
[1:51:12] down the road and the spirit of God came
[1:51:15] in that car and you begin to weep in
[1:51:17] that presence? What does it do? It
[1:51:19] begins to shift that focus from that
[1:51:22] fortress to him.
[1:51:25] Paul and Silas, you be they worshiped in
[1:51:28] prison in a prison that they did not
[1:51:30] even deserve.
[1:51:33] Listen, you might not even deserve to be
[1:51:35] where you're at, but because of your
[1:51:36] humanity, we've done this. But worship
[1:51:39] him in that prison and see what God can
[1:51:42] do. And when they, not only that, when
[1:51:45] God began to move in that moment, in
[1:51:47] that worship, and in that atmosphere,
[1:51:49] they didn't break out of that prison and
[1:51:51] become all selfish. No, that jailer was
[1:51:54] out to take his own life. But their
[1:51:56] desire was for the heart of God. And
[1:51:58] they led that jailer to the Lord.
[1:52:00] Listen, brothers and sisters, when we've
[1:52:02] got to get back away from our fortress
[1:52:04] and realize that somebody may walk
[1:52:06] through that door tonight that'll need
[1:52:08] God. someone off the streets, someone
[1:52:11] that doesn't know anything about this
[1:52:13] message. Let's never lose a heart to get
[1:52:15] this message out.
[1:52:20] God, help us. Help me, Lord. Singing or
[1:52:23] meditating on God's victory, even in the
[1:52:26] midst of the battle where we can sing,
[1:52:28] I'm going to see a victory. And it seems
[1:52:30] like we may not see victory in sight,
[1:52:32] but we know the word of God says that
[1:52:33] we're victorious through him. We can
[1:52:36] have the same spirit of Shadrach,
[1:52:37] Meshach, and Abedneo with no promise of
[1:52:39] relief from those flames. But we're
[1:52:41] going to keep our eyes not on an image,
[1:52:44] but our eyes right to the fire. Listen,
[1:52:46] if you don't show up in there, I know I
[1:52:48] will see you on the other side. Wherever
[1:52:50] God is, it doesn't matter what it is.
[1:52:52] We're not in this message to get out of
[1:52:54] problems. We're in this message to get
[1:52:56] through them with Jesus Christ. Listen,
[1:52:59] the Holy Ghost will not take you from
[1:53:00] your problems, but it'll take you
[1:53:02] through them. We've got to get back to
[1:53:04] trusting him and get these complexes out
[1:53:07] of our life. Listen, even now if we're
[1:53:09] not careful, we're trying to push it
[1:53:11] back and think it's not me. I say, God,
[1:53:14] let's bring those things to light. Let's
[1:53:16] expose them tonight.
[1:53:19] Your children need it. Your
[1:53:21] grandchildren need it. Your brothers and
[1:53:24] sisters need it. You need it. I need it.
[1:53:28] I want victory tonight. I don't want to
[1:53:30] go back to the motel tonight holding on
[1:53:32] to those things and holding on to those
[1:53:33] fears. If I had those, I want to be able
[1:53:35] to leave this place and say, "By your
[1:53:37] grace, I am free. There is no chain that
[1:53:41] is strong enough to hold me down.
[1:53:44] I'm going to see a victory." And the
[1:53:45] devil comes in and says, "But you're
[1:53:46] surrounded. I don't care what I'm
[1:53:47] surrounded, but these are how I This is
[1:53:49] how I fight my
[1:53:50] battles." I like that song. This is how
[1:53:53] I fight. Even if it looks like I'm
[1:53:55] surrounded, I'm surrounded by him.
[1:53:58] This is how do you fight your battles?
[1:54:00] Are you going to mope and complain? No.
[1:54:01] I want to surrender my heart to him.
[1:54:04] Listen, I could stand here tonight and I
[1:54:05] can tell you things that I've been
[1:54:06] through in my life. I can tell you
[1:54:08] testimonies of where I've tried to take
[1:54:10] my own life and yet God would show up
[1:54:12] right on the scene. I I'll never forget
[1:54:14] the moment. And I'm just I'm going there
[1:54:15] because the Lord just brought it. But
[1:54:17] I'll never forget he was not too long
[1:54:19] ago where it seemed like brother Sam
[1:54:21] everything was falling apart in my life.
[1:54:23] I had got into such a condition in my
[1:54:25] mind, such a condition in my heart where
[1:54:27] I couldn't even see my wife. I could not
[1:54:30] even see my children. All I could see
[1:54:32] was the problem. All I could see were
[1:54:34] there was no way out. And I was
[1:54:35] ministering in this condition. But God
[1:54:37] would intervene and he would come
[1:54:38] through. You see, you're not the only
[1:54:40] one here. You don't know what a pastor
[1:54:42] what he's going through when he's
[1:54:43] preaching or a minister what he's going
[1:54:45] through or a pastor's wife or even you
[1:54:47] sitting here tonight. You can be saying
[1:54:49] amen or shouting and still going through
[1:54:51] these battles. But I want you to know
[1:54:53] he's here tonight to go beyond. And I'm
[1:54:55] not trying to work you up tonight. I
[1:54:57] want to tell you that there is something
[1:54:59] that goes beyond just the psychological,
[1:55:02] something that goes beyond the flesh.
[1:55:03] But you've got to let him in to your
[1:55:05] heart. You've got to let peace get back
[1:55:08] into that throne room again.
[1:55:12] You've got to let peace sit on that
[1:55:14] throne again. The peace that passes
[1:55:16] understanding. The only real peace that
[1:55:18] I have, dear Lord, is in you.
[1:55:21] And I'll never forget that moment and I
[1:55:23] was in that home and my wife and I we we
[1:55:25] were going through some things and we
[1:55:27] had a discussion and y each and every
[1:55:28] one of y'all know what a discussion
[1:55:30] means
[1:55:31] sometimes. We had a discussion and and
[1:55:34] it just and it just exploded in my
[1:55:37] heart. I'm just I'm a horrible father.
[1:55:39] I'm a horrible and she didn't have say
[1:55:41] anything to
[1:55:43] this here. Satan's fighting it, but I'm
[1:55:45] not I'm going to keep going. And here
[1:55:47] and so here we find this situation where
[1:55:49] I I'm not the right husband and I'm not
[1:55:51] the good parent. I'm not the good father
[1:55:52] and I'm not a good pastor and I'm not a
[1:55:54] good this and I just said that's it. I'm
[1:55:56] I'm I'm going
[1:55:58] I set everything down. I put my my wife
[1:56:01] knows I don't go anywhere without my
[1:56:03] phone. Don't go anywhere. Ran a business
[1:56:05] at the time and so everything that I had
[1:56:07] I took with me. It was a Saturday night
[1:56:09] and that Saturday night I wasn't going
[1:56:10] to be ministering. Brother Jr. was going
[1:56:12] to be ministering and I I I set
[1:56:14] everything down and I was heading out to
[1:56:16] my vehicle. I'm not going to tell you
[1:56:18] other details, but I was heading to do
[1:56:21] that to take my life. I was just I'm
[1:56:23] done. That's Satan had got me into that
[1:56:25] position.
[1:56:27] And I walked out the door and when I
[1:56:29] walked out the door, I seen uh I think
[1:56:32] it was was uh Ethan. Was it Ethan? Seen
[1:56:36] Ethan. And this just struck me as I
[1:56:38] walked through and I was heading to the
[1:56:40] truck and he turn and he and he never
[1:56:42] usually says anything to me too much. I
[1:56:44] mean, he's cordial, but he's just Ethan.
[1:56:46] He is who he is. And and he walks behind
[1:56:48] me and all a sudden he says, "Hey, Dad."
[1:56:50] I turn around, he says, "I'll see you at
[1:56:52] church." Wow. And I was like, "Okay, I
[1:56:56] I'll see you there." So, I get in my
[1:56:57] vehicle and I and I drive and I I go to
[1:57:01] a park and I go to a park and I'm
[1:57:03] sitting in the truck and I'm just
[1:57:05] battled, broken. And I'm not here to to
[1:57:08] to say anything about just just in this
[1:57:10] condition, bad condition. And I I I go
[1:57:14] out and I start writing and when I begin
[1:57:16] to write, the pen breaks. How does a pen
[1:57:18] break?
[1:57:20] Find another go to write again that pen
[1:57:23] breaks again. I can't even in my mind
[1:57:25] I'm like I can't even write a note.
[1:57:29] It's how far I'm at. I can't even write
[1:57:30] a note.
[1:57:32] And nobody's there. Nobody's at the
[1:57:35] park. It's clear as day. And then all of
[1:57:38] a sudden, somebody pulls right up next
[1:57:41] to me.
[1:57:44] I'm like,
[1:57:46] really? You got the whole park?
[1:57:51] And then all of a sudden it starts a
[1:57:52] downpour like cats and dogs. Why do we
[1:57:54] say that? I don't
[1:57:56] know. But in in Texas it was a big pour.
[1:57:59] Wow. And the guy gets out and he starts
[1:58:01] walking his dog in the
[1:58:05] rain. Who walks their dog in a downpour
[1:58:08] like that?
[1:58:12] I'm like, forget it. I I'm just I'm just
[1:58:14] going to leave.
[1:58:16] So, I get I I I turn on the vehicle and
[1:58:18] and and I and I start driving down the
[1:58:20] road and all of a sudden I see coming
[1:58:22] another direction. I see my son, my
[1:58:23] other son, Eli, and he's coming from the
[1:58:25] church. They just got finished mowing
[1:58:27] and I seen his eyes and I see my and
[1:58:29] just this connection like what is going
[1:58:33] on? And then I finally just said, you
[1:58:36] know what? I'm just going to go to the
[1:58:37] church. And I go to the church and I
[1:58:38] just just lay before God and I'm just
[1:58:41] struggling and I'm battling and I'm
[1:58:42] fighting.
[1:58:44] don't know what's going on. Meanwhile,
[1:58:47] my wife on the other side, normally when
[1:58:49] I leave or something like that goes on,
[1:58:51] she just goes into this kind of panic.
[1:58:54] Where's he at? What's going on? He left
[1:58:55] his phone. She tells this testim her
[1:58:58] side of the testimony to where she she
[1:59:00] says, "I went to bed and took a
[1:59:04] nap." Because there was a piece in her
[1:59:06] heart that God had put that no matter
[1:59:09] what it was, I'll see him again.
[1:59:12] That night I get to church. Brother Jr.
[1:59:14] not knowing the situation, I had to lead
[1:59:17] worship that night.
[1:59:22] So I I say I had to. That's the way I
[1:59:24] felt.
[1:59:26] But something inside of my heart said,
[1:59:27] "You're going to go worship and you're
[1:59:28] going to lead worship no matter what." I
[1:59:29] said, "Okay." So I go up there and we
[1:59:31] have this
[1:59:33] tremendous service. I get back and I sit
[1:59:36] down and literally brother J.R. preaches
[1:59:38] right down every aisle of my heart. not
[1:59:42] knowing.
[1:59:44] We're not out of this. We're not immune
[1:59:45] to this, brothers and sisters.
[1:59:48] And I sat back there and that night,
[1:59:50] God, without anyone knowing, I seen I
[1:59:54] heard my son say something. I seen the
[1:59:57] voice or seen the eyes of my other boy.
[2:00:00] Guy walks a dog in the middle of the
[2:00:02] rain. You say, "What does that matter?"
[2:00:05] God did everything he could to keep me
[2:00:07] and to keep pushing me where I needed to
[2:00:09] go.
[2:00:11] down on my knees in prayer.
[2:00:14] And that was to me. You say, "What does
[2:00:16] that matter?" You see, ever since even
[2:00:18] before I was born, Satan has done
[2:00:20] everything he could to try to take my
[2:00:22] life. They told they told my mom and
[2:00:25] dad, "You need to abort him, because
[2:00:28] he's going to kill you, my mom, and he
[2:00:31] will not even be he will not even be
[2:00:34] able to live. He will be a vegetable."
[2:00:38] And this doctor doesn't believe in
[2:00:39] abortion. He just said, "I'm trying to
[2:00:42] save your life." My mom and dad chose,
[2:00:44] as you can tell, not to do
[2:00:46] that. Call me what you want to call me,
[2:00:49] but I'm here. I want you I want to tell
[2:00:52] you this that you are not alone. And I
[2:00:55] could allow myself to be caught up in
[2:00:57] all kinds of of complexes and all kinds
[2:01:01] of things that I'm not good enough, I'm
[2:01:03] not this, I'm not that. and and and I
[2:01:06] grew up trying to have be the have the
[2:01:08] perfect uh uh this and the perfect this
[2:01:10] and preach the perfect way and sing the
[2:01:12] perfect way. And then here we go. I'm
[2:01:14] gonna have to say this and then here we
[2:01:15] go. Winter Youth Retreat comes
[2:01:18] along and I've sung a song my whole feel
[2:01:21] like my whole life called Praise You in
[2:01:23] the Storm. It's just been my anthem.
[2:01:25] Yeah, that's good. And so, Brother Matt,
[2:01:28] brother Matthew Watkins asked me to
[2:01:30] sing. I'm like, why? I'm not a young
[2:01:31] person. Just leave me alone. You're
[2:01:33] going to sing this. So they had me sing
[2:01:35] that song. So I get up there just like
[2:01:37] normal and I'm like, "God, help us, you
[2:01:39] know, let let it be a blessing." And I
[2:01:41] and I start the song out and I start to
[2:01:43] sing and all of a sudden, and I'm not
[2:01:45] kidding when I say this, my mind was
[2:01:47] attacked. Those keys became white and
[2:01:51] black. No notes in my mind. And the
[2:01:54] words were gone.
[2:01:57] I didn't know uh I I didn't know it from
[2:02:00] anything, brother. It was like You might
[2:02:02] know algebra. I don't that is like
[2:02:03] algebra to me and I've played that song
[2:02:05] my whole life and I'll never forget
[2:02:06] saying God I'm not going to let the
[2:02:08] devil win and I bowed my head and I said
[2:02:11] God please bring it back now I'm
[2:02:12] panicking
[2:02:14] dying inside because the atmosphere was
[2:02:16] there and people were worshiping and all
[2:02:18] of a sudden silence
[2:02:21] the whole entire audience the music
[2:02:27] nothing God ble bring it back God bring
[2:02:29] it back and little by little it began to
[2:02:32] come back the ver the the song the tune.
[2:02:34] So I finished playing out the the tune
[2:02:36] of that song the first verse and then
[2:02:39] came in in the in the in the chorus and
[2:02:41] everyone just joined in and the
[2:02:44] atmosphere came through and broke
[2:02:46] through.
[2:02:48] Hallelujah. Now I want to say this. I
[2:02:49] left that place that that piano feeling
[2:02:53] defeated.
[2:02:55] I just did this in front of the
[2:02:57] Leontaine. They're music people.
[2:03:01] in front of brother Kenny Slacka. I was
[2:03:03] a failure.
[2:03:07] And I go home, I go to the to the room
[2:03:09] and I I call one of my my my pastor
[2:03:11] friends and I told him the testimony.
[2:03:14] Well, it wasn't a testimony to me at the
[2:03:16] time. I told him what happened and he
[2:03:18] said, "You know, you had to
[2:03:22] fail. You had to fail." Really? He said,
[2:03:26] "Yes." He said, "Because if all they see
[2:03:28] is perfection,
[2:03:30] What are they going to do when they
[2:03:31] fall?
[2:03:34] What are they going to do when they make
[2:03:35] a mistake and they see everybody out
[2:03:37] there playing the song just right and
[2:03:39] singing it just right and everything's
[2:03:40] perfect and you know the ministry is
[2:03:42] just right. Listen, we're going to make
[2:03:44] mistakes and we're God's going to allow
[2:03:46] things to happen in our life because
[2:03:47] someone else needs it. Someone else
[2:03:50] needs to know that they're not alone. I
[2:03:52] did say, "Why me, Lord?"
[2:03:55] I'm not going to lie. I I wasn't in an
[2:03:57] instant moment of, "Oh, praise God." But
[2:04:00] I was like, "Okay, thank you, Lord. You
[2:04:02] had you used me in that moment and
[2:04:05] whatever it did and whatever it didn't
[2:04:07] do, but it's for your glory." Listen, we
[2:04:09] are not all here to have that perfect uh
[2:04:12] facade in front of everybody. We're
[2:04:14] broken people. We're hurt people. We've
[2:04:16] been through things in our life, but we
[2:04:17] need to be honest about it, not victim
[2:04:20] about it. Honest about it, not to throw
[2:04:22] it mud in people's face. But if the sun
[2:04:25] therefore shall make you free, you are
[2:04:28] free indeed.
[2:04:30] So it doesn't matter what happens in
[2:04:32] your life, how hard you fall flat, if
[2:04:35] you are that righteous person, you will
[2:04:38] pick yourself up no matter what because
[2:04:40] God will give you the strength to do so.
[2:04:43] I don't care how complex the situation
[2:04:45] is. There is a God that's still in the
[2:04:48] wall breaking business. He is still in
[2:04:51] that complex breaking business.
[2:04:55] Hallelujah. I want to bring it to a
[2:04:57] close with this.
[2:05:00] The hurt or question of the past can no
[2:05:03] longer have a hold in your life when the
[2:05:04] Holy Spirit is active.
[2:05:07] And when the thoughts of people still
[2:05:09] affect you, when you think of an
[2:05:11] individual or when you think of a
[2:05:12] situation and it's still doing something
[2:05:14] here, that's a sign something's still
[2:05:17] not right.
[2:05:19] We cannot allow these little things to
[2:05:21] come in because they may seem small and
[2:05:24] it may seem like they're little and
[2:05:26] they're nothing, but they become
[2:05:28] fortresses that we hold for years and we
[2:05:30] will never be able to help like we can.
[2:05:35] We can break free.
[2:05:38] I want to read the Lord gave us this
[2:05:39] quote right at the very end.
[2:05:42] Like the musicians to
[2:05:44] come just play something softly.
[2:05:48] Brother Brandon makes this statement. He
[2:05:50] says, "How many can just
[2:05:52] feel that God's forgiven you and the
[2:05:56] dove of peace will set on your heart
[2:06:01] again." Just flew back. Just now took up
[2:06:06] her place and the Holy Spirit just moved
[2:06:09] back and said, "Child of mine, I've been
[2:06:14] wanting to love you all the time. you
[2:06:17] just wouldn't let me do it. I can't
[2:06:20] dwell with your old selfish spirit. But
[2:06:23] now that you've surrendered it, I've
[2:06:26] come back to your heart this morning.
[2:06:32] He can't
[2:06:33] dwell when we have something else
[2:06:35] sitting on that throne.
[2:06:38] But he wants to come back. You can have
[2:06:41] peace that passes understanding. And I'm
[2:06:43] not talking about feeling good tonight.
[2:06:45] Listen, I don't want you to just leave
[2:06:46] feeling good. I want you to leave
[2:06:49] changed. Amen. What's the point of all
[2:06:51] this tonight if we still just leave with
[2:06:54] that little chip on the shoulder or that
[2:06:56] little question in the mind or that
[2:06:58] little odd
[2:07:01] feeling? He said, "Leave that gift at
[2:07:04] the altar. Go back. Take care of it,
[2:07:08] whatever it is, and then come back."
[2:07:13] Let's bow our
[2:07:15] heads. Only Jesus can satisfy your soul.
[2:07:20] There is nothing here tonight. There is
[2:07:22] no emotion. There is no feel good. There
[2:07:24] is no
[2:07:26] uh I I don't even know what else to say.
[2:07:29] There's no human element that can change
[2:07:32] what he can do just like
[2:07:34] that. However long we've been in this, I
[2:07:36] I I want you to just child of mine, do
[2:07:39] you know how much he loves you? You have
[2:07:41] to make that personal with you. Child of
[2:07:44] mine. He's calling you that child of
[2:07:47] mine. You wouldn't let me do it. I I
[2:07:49] wanted to come in. How many times I
[2:07:51] could have made your whole life and
[2:07:53] you're uh so much peaceful even in the
[2:07:56] midst of that
[2:07:57] battle. But you keep reverting back to
[2:08:00] the past. You keep going back to these
[2:08:01] things and you're holding on to them and
[2:08:03] you think that they're going to help
[2:08:03] you, but they're not going to help you.
[2:08:05] and you're going through all of these
[2:08:07] things and the pastor has counseledled
[2:08:09] and and you've had situations here and
[2:08:12] situations there, but you still are
[2:08:14] holding on tonight. He said, "You just
[2:08:16] got to let it go so I can child of mine.
[2:08:19] I want to come in, but will you
[2:08:21] surrender that
[2:08:23] throne? Let me come back and sit in it
[2:08:26] tonight." However complex your situation
[2:08:29] is, I can break it.
[2:08:33] Don't act it tonight. Live
[2:08:36] it. Heavenly
[2:08:40] Father. Only you can do
[2:08:43] it. Forgive me, Lord, for my humanity,
[2:08:47] Lord, at times, Father, if I got on the
[2:08:49] way. But may the word may it have gone
[2:08:52] forth to the very depths in the person
[2:08:55] person of every heart.
[2:08:58] [Music]
[2:08:59] We get beyond our who we are and our
[2:09:02] makeup and our our
[2:09:05] personalities and we hold on to these
[2:09:08] things. We say this is who I am. But
[2:09:11] Lord, if you set us free, we're
[2:09:15] free. There's so many scriptures of
[2:09:18] changing. Lord, let us be changed
[2:09:20] tonight. not to look better or act
[2:09:23] better, but Father, we're no matter what
[2:09:27] comes our way, the old trigger
[2:09:29] points are
[2:09:31] gone. Would you come in tonight?
[2:09:35] You are the perfect one and the only one
[2:09:37] in this building tonight that is
[2:09:39] perfect. And we're striving. We're
[2:09:41] looking to that maturity and growing.
[2:09:43] Lord, forgive us all of our
[2:09:48] failures and draw us closer to you. As
[2:09:51] our heads are bowed, would you just be
[2:09:52] honest with him tonight? You don't have
[2:09:55] to if you don't want to. You don't. You
[2:09:56] can lift him in your heart. This is not
[2:09:58] just a a a religious movement that I
[2:10:00] want to do. Just going by the
[2:10:02] leadership. I would you lift your hand
[2:10:04] to him and say, "Lord, there's something
[2:10:06] in my heart that you know. I want to
[2:10:08] surrender it to you." Listen, I'm going
[2:10:11] to even keep my eyes closed because I'm
[2:10:12] not here to look who's responding. I
[2:10:14] don't care. I just want to know the
[2:10:17] heart.
[2:10:19] It's not about the response in the sense
[2:10:21] of what we see with our eyes, but it's
[2:10:24] the response of the heart. Lord, I'm
[2:10:26] tired of that sitting on the throne of
[2:10:28] my heart. I want you to sit. I want you
[2:10:30] to come in every every room and clean
[2:10:33] everything out. I don't want a speck of
[2:10:35] dust from the past. I know I'm going to
[2:10:37] go through battles and I know I'm going
[2:10:38] to face these things again. Of course,
[2:10:40] you are. But when you have him on the
[2:10:42] inside, he'll get you through it. Lord,
[2:10:45] I surrender that to you tonight.
[2:10:48] I surrender that to you tonight.
[2:10:52] Now, I hope the meaning of the song that
[2:10:54] we sang just a minute ago, break me,
[2:10:56] Lord,
[2:10:58] and bless the broken pieces. Let's sing
[2:11:01] that again if we can. May it be
[2:11:03] something
[2:11:05] different. Can we just stand together?
[2:11:09] Consume me
[2:11:13] Lord with the fire of your
[2:11:20] spirit.
[2:11:22] Consume me
[2:11:27] Lord and make me more like
[2:11:34] you. Break. Do you know what you're
[2:11:37] singing? Break me
[2:11:40] Lord and bless the
[2:11:44] broken
[2:11:46] pieces of
[2:11:48] my
[2:11:50] life. This is what he wants to do. Let
[2:11:54] me be
[2:11:58] used
[2:11:59] Lord
[2:12:01] by you. Can you do it from here now?
[2:12:05] Please go beyond this.
[2:12:07] Oh,
[2:12:10] consume me Lord.
[2:12:14] Hallelujah. With the fire of your
[2:12:18] [Music]
[2:12:21] spirit.
[2:12:23] Consume me,
[2:12:27] Lord, and make me more like you. Lord, I
[2:12:34] mean this from my heart.
[2:12:37] Break me
[2:12:41] Lord and bless the
[2:12:44] broken
[2:12:46] pieces of my
[2:12:53] life. Oh, let me be
[2:12:58] used
[2:13:00] Lord
[2:13:02] by you. Can we just do it one more time
[2:13:04] now before we change the song? Oh yes.
[2:13:08] Hallelujah. Consume. Sing it out church.
[2:13:14] Hallelujah. With the
[2:13:17] fire. It's not just about one person.
[2:13:21] Focus on the supremacy of him.
[2:13:23] Now let him walk up down the aisles of
[2:13:26] our heart. Let him speak to you
[2:13:29] directly. Make me more like
[2:13:34] you. Oh, won't you
[2:13:38] break me,
[2:13:42] Lord? And bless the
[2:13:45] broken
[2:13:47] pieces of my life.
[2:13:53] [Music]
[2:13:55] Oh, let me be
[2:13:59] used
[2:14:01] Lord
[2:14:03] by. Hallelujah. Again, don't fall into
[2:14:06] the trap of religion to where you just
[2:14:10] feel
[2:14:11] good. I'm trusting that you've made your
[2:14:14] way with God. That's what I'm doing. I'm
[2:14:17] trusting that I have to. Brothers,
[2:14:19] pastors, evangelist, ministry, you know
[2:14:20] this, right? We trust that God that
[2:14:24] they've met God. It doesn't matter what
[2:14:27] I've just
[2:14:28] said. Unless you meet God for yourself,
[2:14:32] it won't have any effect. But I do want
[2:14:36] to change the song. I want to change it
[2:14:37] to this. Give me the key of A because no
[2:14:40] matter what your past says and what your
[2:14:42] fortress, what it looked like before, I
[2:14:44] want to sing this if I can. I hope we
[2:14:47] can catch this. I am
[2:14:51] redeemed. I've been bought
[2:14:55] with a
[2:14:57] price for
[2:15:00] Jesus has changed my
[2:15:04] whole life.
[2:15:08] Oh, if
[2:15:12] anybody asks
[2:15:14] you just who I
[2:15:19] am. Won't you tell
[2:15:22] them? Tell them I've
[2:15:25] been redeemed. Would you let that change
[2:15:28] happen tonight? Oh yes, I
[2:15:33] am redeemed.
[2:15:36] Hi, brother
[2:15:39] Sam. A price for
[2:15:44] Jesus. He's
[2:15:46] changed my whole life. Oh, I like this
[2:15:50] part. Now, come on, tell them who you
[2:15:52] are. Oh, if
[2:15:56] anybody asks
[2:15:58] you just
[2:16:01] who I am, you can tell
[2:16:06] them that I am
[2:16:12] redeemed. One more
[2:16:14] time singing. I
[2:16:17] am redeemed.
[2:16:21] I've been bought
[2:16:23] with a
[2:16:26] price.
[2:16:29] Jesus has changed my whole life.
[2:16:37] And if
[2:16:40] anybody asks
[2:16:43] you just
[2:16:46] who I
[2:16:48] am, you can tell
[2:16:52] them I
[2:16:54] am redeemed. Oh my. One more time.
[2:16:59] Hallelujah.
[2:17:00] Singing. I am.
[2:17:03] [Music]
[2:17:05] Oh yes. time. But we
[2:17:12] for
[2:17:13] Jesus. Oh, he's changed my whole life.
[2:17:19] My whole
[2:17:21] life. And if
[2:17:26] anybody asks
[2:17:28] you just
[2:17:31] who I am,
[2:17:35] Tell you
[2:17:37] [Music]
[2:17:42] got any rivers? Got any
[2:17:45] rivers? God any rivers?
[2:17:49] Hallelujah. You
[2:17:53] thank
[2:17:57] uncrossable God. any
[2:18:02] mountains you cannot
[2:18:05] run
[2:18:09] through. God
[2:18:13] specializes in things
[2:18:17] thought impossible.
[2:18:19] [Music]
[2:18:22] And he will
[2:18:25] do what no
[2:18:28] other power can
[2:18:32] do. Oh God in near
[2:18:37] rivers you thank
[2:18:41] God uncrossable.
[2:18:47] God, any
[2:18:49] mountains that you can
[2:18:54] tal
[2:18:55] through. Oh, but here's the good news.
[2:18:59] God
[2:19:02] specializes in
[2:19:05] things
[2:19:07] [Music]
[2:19:10] impossible. And he will
[2:19:13] do what? no
[2:19:17] other power can
[2:19:23] do. I believe the Lord is here. Don't
[2:19:26] you? Hallelujah. I believe he's already
[2:19:28] been doing the work.
[2:19:31] And I certainly if you would want
[2:19:33] prayer, hey, that's no sign of
[2:19:36] weakness. We're here to we're here to
[2:19:40] leave out of here different.
[2:19:43] We're here to leave out of here closer
[2:19:44] to God. Right. So, whatever it is, if if
[2:19:47] it's already been met, oh, how we
[2:19:49] worship the Lord, but let's just enter
[2:19:51] that in and
[2:19:53] just if we need prayer tonight, let's
[2:19:55] move into that
[2:19:57] place. But let's not leave out of here
[2:19:59] the same.
[2:20:03] God, any
[2:20:06] rivers that you think
[2:20:09] are uncrossable.
[2:20:14] H God in any
[2:20:18] mountains that you can can't tunnel
[2:20:26] through. But God
[2:20:29] specializes. He's the answer.
[2:20:33] It's
[2:20:34] the
[2:20:37] impossible. And
[2:20:40] he will
[2:20:42] do what no
[2:20:46] other can
[2:20:48] [Music]
[2:20:51] do. Sing that. He touched me. Shackled
[2:20:55] by.
[2:20:56] [Music]
[2:21:06] Oh, thank you Jesus.

[2:22:27] know he touched
[2:22:31] me and
[2:22:34] made me whole.
[2:22:41] And ever
[2:22:43] since I've met this
[2:22:47] blessed
[2:22:52] savior and ever
[2:22:55] since
[2:22:57] he's Lord, thank you father. Thank you
[2:23:01] for your mercy Lord. Thank you Jesus for

[2:23:26] Lord
[2:23:28] for he touched me. Yes.

[2:23:37] me. Thank you,
[2:23:39] Jesus. And
[2:23:43] oh, the joy that floods my
[2:23:51] soul. For I know
[2:23:55] something has
[2:23:58] happened. And now
[2:24:01] And I
[2:24:04] know he touched
[2:24:08] me and
[2:24:11] made me
[2:24:17] whole in the presence of Jehovah.

[2:26:38] Thank you, Lord. Oh, how do you
[2:26:41] describe?
[2:26:47] Oh, how do you describe?
[2:26:52] That's right.
[2:26:55] A love that goes from east to west

[2:28:19] you
[2:28:20] an awesome
[2:28:23] God. You
[2:28:25] are. That's when words are not
[2:28:29] enough to tell you of our
[2:28:33] love. Just listen to our heart.
[2:28:39] Words could
[2:28:40] fall. Oh, with the words.
[2:28:46] Yes, Lord Jesus.
[2:28:48] [Music]
[2:28:49] Oh, from these lips of mine.
[2:28:57] No. If I had a thousand more
[2:29:03] years, I would still run out of time.
[2:29:12] So if you listen to my heart,
[2:29:19] Lord, every being will say,
[2:29:27] Lord, I thank you for the
[2:29:30] life. Thank you for the truth. Thank you
[2:29:37] for the way.
[2:29:42] So listen to our
[2:29:50] hearts. Hear our spirit
[2:29:55] sing. Yes.
[2:29:58] A song of praise and that
[2:30:04] flows from those you have redeemed.
[2:30:13] And we will use the words we know to
[2:30:19] tell you what
[2:30:22] an awesome God you are. Hallelujah.
[2:30:28] [Music]
[2:30:30] Hallelujah. Glory.

[2:30:57] Lord, if I had a thousand years,
[2:31:05] I would still run out of
[2:31:09] time. Hallelujah.
[2:31:13] If you listen to my heart. Oh yes
[2:31:18] [Applause]
[2:31:20] Lord. Every beat will
[2:31:25] sing.
[2:31:27] Lord I thank you
[2:31:30] for thank you Lord. I thank you for the
[2:31:34] truth. Hallelujah. I thank you for the
[2:31:38] way.
[2:31:43] So listen to our
[2:31:50] hearts. Hear our spirit
[2:31:58] sing. Song of praise that
[2:32:05] flows from those you have redeemed.

[2:32:12] Oh, and we will use the words we know
[2:32:19] just to tell you what
[2:32:23] an awesome God that you
[2:32:27] Hallelujah. That's words are not
[2:32:31] enough just to tell you all of our love.
[2:32:36] So listen to our hearts. Hallelujah.
[2:32:40] Could we just sing it without music?
[2:32:44] So listen to our
[2:32:46] [Music]
[2:32:51] hearts. Hear our spirit sing.
[2:32:57] [Music]
[2:32:59] Bring a praise that
[2:33:01] [Music]
[2:33:05] flows from those you have
[2:33:08] [Music]
[2:33:12] redeemed. And we will use the words we
[2:33:17] know to tell you what
[2:33:22] an awesome God you are. And when words
[2:33:29] are not
[2:33:30] enough to tell you of our
[2:33:34] love, then listen to our
[2:33:38] heart with music.
[2:33:42] So listen to our
[2:33:49] hearts. Hear our spirit sing.
[2:33:55] [Music]
[2:33:58] A song of praise that
[2:34:01] flows. A song of
[2:34:04] praise from those you have redeemed.
[2:34:11] Yes, Lord. Oh, and we will use the words
[2:34:16] we know to tell
[2:34:20] you.
[2:34:23] Awome
[2:34:25] God, you
[2:34:27] are when words are not
[2:34:33] enough. My
[2:34:35] love, listen to Run to the run to the
[2:34:40] father.
[2:34:42] So when words are not enough
[2:34:47] to tell you of our
[2:34:50] love, listen to our heart.
[2:34:58] [Music]
[2:35:02] I've carried a burden
[2:35:08] too long on my own.
[2:35:11] [Music]
[2:35:14] I wasn't
[2:35:18] created to bear it alone.
[2:35:24] I hear your invitation.
[2:35:29] [Music]
[2:35:30] to let it all go. Lord, I see it now. I
[2:35:36] lay it down. And I know that I need you.
[2:35:43] I run to the father. I fall into grace.
[2:35:49] I'm done with the hiding. No room to
[2:35:53] wait. My heart needs a surgeon. My soul
[2:35:58] needs a friend. So I run to the father
[2:36:02] again and again and again again and
[2:36:06] again.
[2:36:10] Yes. Amen.
[2:36:15] Oh, I've carried a burden.
[2:36:21] Yes, Lord. Too long on my own.
[2:36:26] Oh, I wasn't
[2:36:31] created to bury it
[2:36:36] alone. Oh, I
[2:36:42] invitation to let it all go. Well, I see
[2:36:47] it now. I'm laying it down. And I know
[2:36:52] that I need you. So I run to the father.
[2:37:00] I fall into grace. I'm done with the
[2:37:04] hiding. No reason to wait. My heart
[2:37:08] needs a searching. My soul needs a
[2:37:12] friend. So I run to the father again and
[2:37:17] again and again and again.
[2:37:30] Oh, oh Lord, you saw my
[2:37:34] condition. Oh yes, you had a plan from
[2:37:38] the start.
[2:37:41] Oh, your son for redemption.
[2:37:46] Yes, Lord. the price for my
[2:37:51] all and I don't have a
[2:37:55] [Music]
[2:38:00] compet. I don't
[2:38:03] understand. I can't
[2:38:05] comprehend. All I know is I need you. I
[2:38:12] run to the father. I fall into grace.
[2:38:17] I'm done with the hiding. No reason to
[2:38:21] wait. My heart needs a surgeon. My soul
[2:38:25] needs a friend. So I run to the father
[2:38:30] again and again and again and
[2:38:34] again.
[2:38:37] Oh.
[2:38:40] Oh.
[2:38:42] Oh. My heart said in your sights long
[2:38:49] before my first breath. Running
[2:38:55] into your arms. He's running to life
[2:39:01] from death. And I feel this rush deep in
[2:39:07] my chest. Your mercy is
[2:39:12] calling out just as I am. You pull me
[2:39:18] in. And I know that I need you. I run to
[2:39:25] the father. I fall into grace. I'm done
[2:39:30] with the
[2:39:31] high reason to wait. Oh, my heart needs
[2:39:36] a search. My soul needs a bread. So I
[2:39:40] run to the father again in and again and
[2:39:45] again and again.
[2:39:48] Fall into grace.
[2:39:51] Done with the
[2:39:52] hiding reason to wait on. My heart found
[2:39:57] a search. My soul had found a friend. So
[2:40:01] I run to the father again and again
[2:40:05] again and again and
[2:40:11] [Music]
[2:40:21] again. Praise the Lord Jesus.
[2:40:25] Thank you,
[2:40:25] [Music]
[2:40:28] Lord. How many could just say to the
[2:40:31] Lord, "Father, I've been helped. I've
[2:40:35] been ministered to." Hallelujah.
[2:40:40] Isn't he so gracious to come by our way?
[2:40:45] You know, there's many things that you
[2:40:47] can see this and this is really a lot of
[2:40:51] where Brother Jeremy was at
[2:40:53] tonight. And it's to be honest in God's
[2:40:57] presence. You know, it's the safest
[2:41:01] place that you can ever be.
[2:41:04] [Music]
[2:41:07] When the Holy Spirit begins to open
[2:41:09] things in our life and begins to go down
[2:41:11] things that there's no psychiatrist
[2:41:14] could uncover this.
[2:41:18] And even if they could, they couldn't
[2:41:20] fix it.
[2:41:21] There's no psychologist that can get to
[2:41:23] those places. I'm not against, like
[2:41:25] brother Ram said, everything, all those
[2:41:27] helps. I'm not against that. But we need
[2:41:30] more than a psychiatrist and a
[2:41:33] psychologist.
[2:41:34] I I'll just be honest with you. I don't
[2:41:36] need I don't need a man to diagnose my
[2:41:39] problems. That's right. God can work
[2:41:42] through the agency of a man, but it has
[2:41:44] to be God. Because when God does it, he
[2:41:47] has a way that he doesn't make us walk
[2:41:51] into areas by ourself. So true. He goes
[2:41:55] right there and he's holding our hand
[2:41:57] the whole time. That is so true.
[2:41:59] Hallelujah. It might be Jericho in your
[2:42:02] life. It might be AI in your life. It
[2:42:04] might whatever that point is. Yes, sir.
[2:42:08] He's there with you. Amen. Sometimes
[2:42:11] it's things that can be so deep from the
[2:42:14] past. And we as we're still we still
[2:42:17] live in these shells and these pest
[2:42:20] houses, you know, if if we were just
[2:42:24] blocks of wood or stone, well, you can
[2:42:27] kind of deface those a little bit and
[2:42:29] everything on the outside. But we're
[2:42:32] complex beings. That's right. And
[2:42:35] there's things at times that can happen,
[2:42:38] situations in life, sometimes when it's
[2:42:40] young, sometimes middle.
[2:42:43] Constantly, we're going to have to
[2:42:45] continue to present ourselves under the
[2:42:49] washing of water by the word. There's
[2:42:52] nothing that can expose and minister to
[2:42:55] the depths in our life like the Lord
[2:42:58] can. Absolutely. I tell you, we're not
[2:43:02] alone. Amen. We're not helpless.
[2:43:06] We're not
[2:43:07] hopeless because of him.
[2:43:11] That's why in the midst of the
[2:43:13] situation, no matter what it's been, you
[2:43:16] can look to him tonight who has taken a
[2:43:19] hold of your hand to go right down into
[2:43:21] that place in your life. And like the
[2:43:23] prophet told the one sister across the
[2:43:25] prayer line and why Christ speak, he
[2:43:27] said, "The power of that complex has
[2:43:29] been broken just now." Hallelujah.
[2:43:31] Hallelujah.
[2:43:33] She wasn't aware of the break, but he
[2:43:35] identified that breakage and she said,
[2:43:38] "Will you think I'm going to be all
[2:43:39] right?" He said, "Sister, go from here
[2:43:44] and thanking the Lord and let your
[2:43:48] testimony be positive for what God has
[2:43:51] done.
[2:43:53] [Music]
[2:43:56] I'm glad he cares."
[2:44:00] And I wonder in the midst of this this
[2:44:02] generation as the prophet, this is one
[2:44:04] quote that always stood out to me out of
[2:44:06] Grass Valley Jehovah Gyra series. The
[2:44:08] prophet closing it out. He said, "I pray
[2:44:11] that God will let me come back here and
[2:44:13] set up a tent someday." He said,
[2:44:15] "Because I've seen your honesty with
[2:44:18] God." And he said, "When you're honest
[2:44:20] with God, it's unlimited of what God can
[2:44:24] do.
[2:44:26] [Music]
[2:44:28] Hallelujah.
[2:44:31] You know, there's a lot of things in our
[2:44:33] life throughout our lives we've kept
[2:44:35] hidden. Maybe it was around people when
[2:44:37] I was in school. Didn't want them to
[2:44:39] know certain things. Didn't want them to
[2:44:40] know I was
[2:44:42] poor. Didn't want him to know those
[2:44:44] things. But you know, this is different.
[2:44:46] In his presence, there's not a
[2:44:49] demeaning. There's not a condemning.
[2:44:52] Conviction, but not condemning.
[2:44:55] I'll tell you, every time that he
[2:44:56] convicts, Calvary is what comes in view.
[2:45:01] I'm your way. I'm the truth. Not what
[2:45:04] you've heard, not what you've been told,
[2:45:06] not what you felt. I am the truth of
[2:45:08] your life.
[2:45:10] [Music]
[2:45:12] That's what Calvary means. That's what
[2:45:15] the resurrection brought to us.
[2:45:18] I am your truth. Amen. I am the way.
[2:45:24] Glory be to God. You know what's
[2:45:27] happened tonight? This has taken a hold
[2:45:28] of that word. It's been poking holes in
[2:45:31] that cloud.
[2:45:33] Hallelujah. That cloud of gloom and
[2:45:36] doubt and whatever tried to swirl around
[2:45:39] that sword, that word, you've been
[2:45:40] taking that word and poking holes in it.
[2:45:42] And the prophet said in greatest battle
[2:45:44] ever fought, he said, you poke a one
[2:45:46] hole in it, it still don't go away. He
[2:45:48] said you keep poking, you keep striking,
[2:45:50] you keep striking until you break the
[2:45:51] whole thing back. What is it that's
[2:45:54] breaking it back? It's faith in the word
[2:45:56] of God. It's accepting what God has
[2:45:59] already done and said about you. I say
[2:46:02] tonight, you ought to lift your foot up
[2:46:04] and put anxiety under your foot. Put
[2:46:06] depression under your foot. Put that
[2:46:08] complex under your
[2:46:10] foot. On the bottom of your foot, write
[2:46:13] the name Hmon complex. And begin to
[2:46:16] stomp that
[2:46:17] thing.
[2:46:19] Hallelujah. Because why? We're in the
[2:46:21] feast of pure M. There's a pure life, a
[2:46:24] pure blood, a pure Holy Spirit by a pure
[2:46:27] word. Glory be to God. Oh my. Oh, we're
[2:46:31] not worked up. We know where we're
[2:46:33] standing in his presence.
[2:46:36] It's because of him.
[2:46:40] This lovely one who's in our midst.
[2:46:45] Oh, hallelujah.
[2:46:47] Can we just worship him just for a
[2:46:49] moment? Just take a moment.
[2:46:51] Thank you, Jesus.
[2:46:55] Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord.
[2:46:58] Oh, thank you, Lord Jesus, for your
[2:47:01] mercy,
[2:47:02] Lord. Thank you for your care, Lord.

[2:47:48] Lord.
[2:47:49] Father, we've Lord contacted one another
[2:47:53] and Lord, plans have fallen into place,
[2:47:56] but I believe dear God, that this night,
[2:47:59] Lord, was arranged before the foundation
[2:48:02] of the
[2:48:03] world. You knew, Lord Jesus, the needs.
[2:48:06] You knew we would be here, Father. And
[2:48:09] Lord, you're so mindful, Lord. Oh
[2:48:12] God, you're not like King Ahazarus. You
[2:48:15] know the need in our life. You know,
[2:48:18] Lord Jesus, even the attempts that Hmon
[2:48:21] has tried to make, Lord. But Father, you
[2:48:24] and your grace, Lord, and Father, as
[2:48:26] standing as Esther, we've been
[2:48:28] encouraged, Lord, by the message of
[2:48:31] Mori, Lord, that we can recognize who we
[2:48:34] are, Lord God, to encourage that we're
[2:48:37] here for it, Lord, in such a time as
[2:48:40] this. And God, you have given us grace
[2:48:42] right through this service, Lord Jesus.
[2:48:45] To expose our enemy in the presence of
[2:48:49] the king.
[2:48:51] Glory be to God.
