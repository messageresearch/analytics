praise the Lord Saints our god reigns Psalm 2113 says be thou exalted Lord in thine own strength so will we sing and praise thy power on Saturday October 10th sometime between 2 and 3:00 my son Ben was involved in a catastrophic car accident he was in the right hand lane on I 271 going northbound doing uh 70 miles an hour for our reasons we still do not know Ben's car rammed into the Concrete Construction barrier on the passenger side the car then Carin off of that barrier sliding across the road slamming into an OD do truck and the force of that the force of that sent the car spinning back across the road slamming back into the concrete uh barrier facing in the opposite direction my son was not under the influence of any narcotics or alcohol I am Overjoyed to report that there was not any loss of life my son's passenger walked away from the accident with a broken nose and some bruising the ODOT workers were nowhere near the truck and when the car was going back and forth across the highway uh there were not any cars in the area my yes it's it's it's amazing it's it's amazing my son however suffered serious but non-life-threatening injuries he has six broken ribs on his right side dislocated hip dislocated knee torn MCL and Patell ATT tendon crash tore all of the ligaments in his NE in his left knee then has compound fractures to his pelvis which took a n and a half hour surgery to piece back together with screws uh the surger was only expected to take six hours but uh there was more damage than what they had anticipated uh for the first 48 Hours he was an ICU and he was on all kinds of pain medication they finally put him on Fenton all of all things and uh not even that was um able to amarate his uh his pain um all he could do was just lay there and moan and um I couldn't touch his forehead I couldn't stroke his head I couldn't hold his hand I couldn't talk to him um all he could do is just lay there and moan and his mouth was just quivering like he was cold but of course we know that was from the pain he has had six surgeries in four weeks with at least one possible two more surgeries to his left knee as you can tell by the pictures this is not a crash anyone would survive one of his orthopedic surgeons said that this has been the worst crash he has ever seen friends the pictures uh do not do it justice I had a chance to see the car in person at the impound lot my wife and I went there to retrieve some of my son's belongings and when we walked up to the car now friends I'm I'm not bragging or anything I'm a pretty tough guy I've been through a lot of things I got to hide like a rhinoceros believe me but nothing is nothing prepared me to see that car in person uh it it was just I I I don't have words to describe it you you would have to see in a person to realize her renous this accident was the driver's side was completely destroyed um how he escaped with no injuries um to his head his neck his brain his spinal cord he had no internal injuries to any of his organs how he escaped without that um I know we use the word a lot but it's the only word I have it was a miracle it's an absolute Miracle we were also sent the photos the police took and um if you can believe it those pictures were more disturb in than the ones you see on um on the screen in one picture there's a picture of my son from his mid mid arm here down to his feet still in the driver's side of the car um I recognized his pants I recognized his uh recognized his sweatshirt and U yeah that was that was really tough to see that was really tough to see another picture was um another picture was taken from the back of the car about 10 15 feet uh the police took and you could see his head slumped over on the right hand side and uh yeah that was pretty tough that was pretty tough to see uh I'm not ashamed to admit that I wept uncontrollably uh it was it was it was tough it was tough but but [Applause] God but God rich in Mercy had my son covered P his back however you want to say it and he pull that kid out of the car he pull that kid from the Jaw of death because believe me that car was a death trve and he gave me back my son yes yes yes yes praise the Lord Saints Our God Reigns as if that wasn't a big enough blessing God again showed himself to be might beyond my comprehension there was something else that happened as a result of this accident it was something that I did not expect that I did not see coming in a million years God chose to make it happen now my son and I have always been close uh but we weren't as close as brother Samuel as with his sons we were kind of friendly close we'd hug each other you know when he'd come and go but there was no there was no real real closeness like a father should have a son and that's my fault uh when he was growing up um I had a lot of personal problems and I just couldn't be the father to my children his mother basically raised those children she went to every hockey game she went to every band concert and she went every softball game she went to every parent and teacher conference and not one time not one time did she ever utter a mumbling word at one time that's my little Queen she's been My Little Queen for 40 years she quite a woman quite a woman but something happened in the in in the ICU after that accident that would forever change our relationship now at the same time Ben is dealing with unspeakable pain he has this personal problem rear its ugly head at a very inopportune time and it it compounds the the trouble he's in I mean he's depressed he's guilty he's afraid and then his personal problem comes in out of the blue and gets dumped into his lap he's trying to deal with all this in addition to chronic pain at one point he's laying in his bed and he's just staring straight ahead to where the TV's [Music] at his lips starts to quiver his face gets that blotchy pink color when you're when you're about to cry and he turns his head slowly to the left and he looks at me with those beautiful green eyes of his looks me straight in the face and he utters the words Dad I need your advice I have not heard those words come from that boy 29 years dad need your advice I knew right then I knew immediately something momentous that just happened I knew right then that God did something that I had spent years and years and years trying to do God at One Moment In Time healed the breach between my son and my son I can tell you friends all of the years of Shame all of the years of Agony all of the years of disappointment all of the years of anger at myself all of the years of despondency because I had given up that I would ever have that kind of relationship with him I was willing to accept whatever I had it was better than not having him at all all of that in a moment in time was gone God ended my personal help what had been my personal help for years he ended it right there [Music] um I've had many experiences with the Lord my my life please don't think that I'm bragging or I'm trying to show off or I'm flapping my angel wings at you but he's done some incredible things in my life since I was four years old um just some Monumental things nothing that he has ever done for me this is the greatest thing that God has ever done for me it's the greatest things ever done for me he did something I was unable to do he did something I spent years trying to [Music] do it's the greatest thing he's ever done for me no wonder the hym writer could write how great thou art thy power throughout the Universe displayed no wonder the song

what a wonderful privilege it is to worship Him isn't you know to the reality is the Bible says when he had opened the seven seal all heaven was silent I tell you these uh the brothers and I know that one thing for sure they they really take it very very serious and I really appreciate that because at leading into worship there's an atmosphere that's created and it's not the song leader does it but it begins there with even that and us coming with an expectation and I just appreciate that the musicians just yielding because amen we're only here just for a few moments amen and there's things that God will do here in our midst that's so important that's Eternal you believe that amen we're we're going to uh prepare to lift a love offering and so as the brothers would come uh at this time and I know there's already those that uh well want understand there's already been some that's been coming in and so forth so and we had told you about that uh from even some weeks ago but we just wanted to lift that today I also also want to remind you as the brothers are coming to do that next Sunday well this coming Thursday brother Timothy aong from GH West Africa will be here with us and that's been a few years since brother Timothy was here and um brother Timothy um he's he had been in the states uh even last year and the year before but he had dealt with uh prostate cancer so the Lord has has healed our brother and so he's been able to come back around and so brother Timothy contacted me I said absolutely we we'll we'll make room for you I just we love brother Timothy amen he's such a the the ministry is just such a blessing um I also have a real special request to that I I'm going to continue to remind you but um brother joshu you know uh he and sister Sharon were married back in February and how did God intervene Ved for her to have that interview to be able to come here it was nothing short of a miracle am now that interview he's over there right now and that interview is going to take place on November 22nd so I I just want us just to continue to fervently pray we know it's a miracle of where it stands right now but I said we're not going to stop praying until her feet are on this soil amen so that's the day before Thanksgiving when she has that interview but I just want to continue to remind you in the upcoming services so as we just prepare to lift the love offering and just pray over this and as well as the word that the Lord would speak to our hearts this morning Heavenly Father Lord as we come to this moment in the service Lord we're thank thankful for your grace and mercy upon Our Lives Lord we certainly Lord it echoes from our hearts Lord there's a Hallelujah that comes from our soul lord there's a thank you Lord Jesus for your grace and your mercy Lord father we love you Lord what a privilege it is Lord just to Lord to worship you in spirit and in truth Lord we want to say we don't we don't want to take that for granted Lord how your presence Lord how that you come Among Us Lord oh God you you come Among Us Lord to move Lord upon our needs to encourage us Lord to change lives Lord oh Father may you just come Lord this morning once again take us a speaker and hearer together anoint us Lord may we just be Lord just reserved to speak only what it is that you desire to say Lord You've placed certain things Lord on my heart and I just ask that God you'd give me the grace to step aside that we can hear from you this morning Lord I pray that you'll bless this love offering Lord that Lord is we're about to lift and I know Lord there's that which has already gone into it Lord and I pray that you'll bless your children Lord father we certainly aren't a aren't a wealthy or a rich group of people Lord but Lord we're just thankful in what little little Lord that we have Lord that God we can place it Lord into your hands and to know that God father it's you that Lord that takes Lord the little Lord there's much in it Lord now may you just guide and direct Lord we pray father bless your children Lord as they would sacrifice Lord and they do sacrifice may you bless them Lord bless us this morning in your presence Lord as you would come and speak to our hearts once again we love you and we thank you father in Jesus name amen amen God bless you um I want to say boy doesn't this look nice and uh brother um brother Sean and and brother Brian Holden have certainly labored quite a bit and I'll say that uh when uh brother Sean has to tap brother Brian come in on some of the technical part but as far as all the research and I mean there's there's things Beyond this what you see in order to make this happen there's things down here there's thing wiring that's been run and uh different things to make it um uh usable even to where when we need to plug in up here we can plug in and and have it run so it's widescreen and uh you might you know you might think well why did we have to go to the the WID screen screen well you know even when most some of the brothers come in with PowerPoint or if I want to do something I always have to think because all of your setups now want to go strictly to widescreen and have been for years so uh it's it's nice to be able to have that and so brother Brian hopefully doesn't have to sweat too much when you know you always love about brother Brian there's no question what he's thinking when a problem is solved you but I I I I trust that there's been that of the burden being able to take off of him and brother Brian's always one of those if I tell him I have a slide or I have something to show hey hey hey I I need it give me your iPad give me your I want to test this I I want to check this out so I appreciate that don't you amen I I really appreciate that so amen well we love you in the lord it's certainly good to be good to be back home good to be back with you and uh just so thankful for your prayers as we were gone and uh we just want to turn our attention to the word of the Lord this morning and ask if you'll turn with me in Revelations chap 12 and uh I want to also say I just so appreciate I've seen uh little Aaron here sitting on the front row and my goodness that is you know I I I didn't I didn't ask him to sit on the front row but it's one of those things that here he's he's made that that move and I really appreciate that and just getting in and and I'll tell you um he's one that I can always uh among the young people we on our Bible study there on uh on on the Friday nights Aron's always one I can count on to get the discussion going and I really enjoy that there's a lot of good points and a lot of things that he has to you know grasp and and say and then we start probing around with the other young people people but I really I really appreciate that amen and uh brother Brian Jr came and did the Bible study for us on sun on on H Friday evening and my just a wonderful job and we certainly had a wonderful time uh together there so uh my it was just it was really good verse uh Revelations 12 and and verse one now I'm just going to go ahead and warn you I'm not going to dive deep into this on Revelation 12 but I just want to bring together certain certain parts of showing where that the Church of the Living God where we're where we are standing in this hour and uh the thought that I want to speak on uh today is living in the Realms of Grace Living in the Realms of Grace So in Revelations 12 verse1 and I say that because there's a lot of you could go into every one of these little points and we could spend a month of Sundays on it but we just want to get to the point here verse one and there appeared a great Wonder in heaven a woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of 12 stars and she being with child cried travailing in birth and pain to be delivered and there appeared another Wonder in heaven and behold a great red dragon having seven horns uh seven heads and 10 horns and seven crowns of upon his head we we know that's Rome right and his tail drew the third part of the stars of Heaven the prophet of God comes and takes that in verse four and he tell takes that word tail and it's t a l e it's not a literal Tale But it's the tale the lie that he told his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and did cast them to the earth and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to to be delivered for to devour her child as soon as it was born so who was it that tried to destroy the Christ child who was that that came after him am I in a Bible Church it was Rome right Satan and Satan and in inspiring and was coming after verse 5 and she brought forth a Manchild who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron and her child was caught up unto God and to his throne may God bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I want to just uh just just to refer here just a few moments here within Revelations 12 so you kind of get my direction that I I want to go here in looking back at that first verse there appeared a great Wonder in heaven a woman we know that represents a church clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of 12 stars now that sun itself it it represents the dispensation of grace and the moon the dispensation of law out of questions and answers law having a shadow brother Bram says it like this this woman was travailing she was going to bring forth a child and she was standing there the sun rising at her head the moon going under her feet it's done passed away she's done live through the dispensation of law so the moon spoke of that of the law Paul speaking seeing have having the Shadow the law had a shadow of good things to come just a shadow the sun was the perfect and now they can't both Shine the same time the law could hang but it won't shine because the gospel outshines it the moon can hang here 12:00 in the day and you have to look very close to see it because the sun's so much brighter till it just outshines it it may be still hanging there to show that it was last night but its light's done gone that's the law the Law's light has done gone and live now it's a gospel of dispensation of grace and the power of the Holy Ghost and the resurrected Jesus Christ manifesting himself in a greater light than that so as we we see that as the as we open up it it it you know many of scripture have a compound meaning in one part of this here scripture it speaks of the Jewish Orthodox Church of where that little Remnant there was a little Remnant who was expecting and waiting on the Messiah brother Brown takes that even in the message birth pains and he'll actually call them out by name you had Simeon you had Anna just a small little group that was actually waiting on the consolation of Israel yet we could have asked you could have asked many others of the Pharisees and different ones throughout and say are you really waiting but you know there's the difference between knowledge and Revelation Revelation itself is what really Burns in your heart it's a it's a reality it's something that's more than just a form or a tradition or just what you know is right but there's a reality and even under the law there was a measure of reality that could be given to the children of God that they could expect and look forward in their day in their time to this coming promise of the Messiah and so they were awaiting for this of the Messiah which which here she brings forth uh the the the child she brings forth Christ and then then after his his uh crucifixion and rising from from the dead and sending back his life now that same life operates in the early church how many remember in the scripture I think it's 2 John
