[40:22] there's no one

[40:29] mercy once again this morning so
[40:32] so glad to be able to be gathered
[40:33] together god has made a way that we can
[40:36] be here this morning
[40:40] certainly wasn't expecting this as far
[40:42] as these thursdays we've had to cancel
[40:45] god's been
[40:46] very gracious to us over the past number
[40:48] of years i don't really remember
[40:50] some of the last times we had to cancel
[40:52] services
[40:54] so
[40:55] i'm just thankful to the lord
[40:58] thankful for his leadership and his
[40:59] guidance on everything in our lives
[41:02] but it's just good to be together
[41:05] and these are these are times that we
[41:08] we take and we value
[41:10] very deeply
[41:12] because in these times that we come
[41:14] together
[41:16] it's more than just seeing one another
[41:19] yet brother bram says when the love of
[41:20] god is in your heart he says you long
[41:23] to go
[41:24] where others are
[41:26] and fellowship
[41:28] because it's you're a part of the body
[41:31] it's a part of the body of jesus christ
[41:35] and that's something that you or i
[41:36] didn't do in ourselves that's a work of
[41:38] the holy spirit
[41:40] that brings us into that place
[41:43] you know
[41:44] just like if i spoke to an individual
[41:47] not too long ago
[41:48] i said if you just imagine in this way
[41:51] if you sat down to type anything out on
[41:53] the computer and your left hand said you
[41:56] know what
[41:58] uh
[41:59] i'm not gonna i don't feel like this
[42:01] today i don't feel like touching keys
[42:02] today and i'm just going to take take
[42:04] the day off
[42:08] you can't do that
[42:10] you can't do that
[42:12] it's there's times in our life that you
[42:14] know what when we come to the house of
[42:16] god let me just be honest sometimes it's
[42:19] easy
[42:21] are you hearing me sometimes it's easy
[42:23] then there's other times you've got to
[42:25] press
[42:27] and i'm not just talking about burnt
[42:29] toast burnt eggs electrics out
[42:32] i'm not talking about that i'm sometimes
[42:33] i'm talking about where you're pressing
[42:36] beyond even thoughts
[42:39] pressing beyond things that come your
[42:41] way
[42:42] and i want you to understand this we're
[42:44] living in an hour in an age
[42:47] when when the prophet of god would take
[42:49] and deal with the characteristics that
[42:51] are in the age around us
[42:54] you know
[42:56] those spirits are real
[42:58] the spirit of that pressure that the
[43:00] prophet identified of the ladies and age
[43:02] is a pressure of soft easy living that
[43:06] would seem
[43:07] contradictory a pressure to be soft easy
[43:10] living but think of it the pressure that
[43:13] comes to where
[43:14] to to come upon us to just cave in at
[43:17] certain things
[43:19] well this is required this is oh i just
[43:21] don't i don't know if i can or i don't
[43:23] know and listen
[43:24] let's just be honest the scriptures
[43:26] identify this
[43:28] the flesh is weak
[43:30] the spirit is willing
[43:32] the flesh is never going to be a
[43:33] cheerleader for us to the things of god
[43:37] the flesh is never going to be a
[43:38] cheerleader but the flesh is going to
[43:40] always be against us
[43:44] but the brahm uses countless
[43:46] stories and once again going into
[43:48] different things and we recognize we're
[43:50] here this morning it's been a battle and
[43:54] we're engaged in a battle
[43:56] right here this morning as the word will
[43:58] come forth there is an engagement in
[44:00] battle
[44:02] we've come to do battle this morning
[44:05] we've come amen to announce to satan
[44:08] once again you're defeated
[44:12] and to announce to him you showed up at
[44:14] the wrong meeting
[44:17] that's the kind of people were to be you
[44:19] showed up at the wrong time
[44:21] this is the wrong time
[44:23] god tarries tomorrow showed up at the
[44:25] wrong time
[44:28] amen
[44:29] amen and amen
[44:32] i just want to as we go to the throne of
[44:34] god in prayer once again there's a
[44:36] request that came in for
[44:39] my aunt linda
[44:41] and
[44:43] they they had to she went back into the
[44:45] icu and they put her
[44:47] [Music]
[44:49] with on that bipap you know she had the
[44:50] double lung transplant and there's just
[44:53] um
[44:54] she's doing very well her body has
[44:56] accepted
[44:57] the lungs but i'm going to say this to
[44:59] all of us as a church and i've said this
[45:01] over and over not just when it comes to
[45:03] my lender or anybody else but when we
[45:06] hear when you hear someone else who's
[45:08] sick in the congregation and you hear
[45:11] oh there's improvement what should i do
[45:14] put your foot on the gas a little bit
[45:15] more
[45:17] don't take it off just put the foot on
[45:19] the gas a little bit more
[45:22] because victory is right there in sight
[45:25] so we want to go before the throne of
[45:27] god and take
[45:28] take our sister linda in prayer because
[45:30] i tell you god has certainly kept his
[45:32] hand upon her and provided for her
[45:36] you know i like paul said this morning i
[45:38] miss seeing her set back there and just
[45:40] her hands in there and just worshiping
[45:42] and
[45:43] you know just just
[45:44] just weeping in the presence of god
[45:47] but
[45:48] we'll be gathered together here
[45:50] amen again we believe that god he is
[45:53] working and god is mindful
[45:56] god didn't bring her this far
[46:00] is that right
[46:03] i also want to remind you this morning
[46:05] as we
[46:06] as we go in prayer also the fellowship
[46:08] dinner following the service
[46:11] and we just want to just turn our hearts

[49:20] amen
[49:22] amen don't you love him
[49:25] amen let's turn in our bibles to haggai
[49:27] chapter one
[49:56] i'm just going to read verses one and
[49:57] two and then i'm gonna i'll ask you you
[49:59] can be seated then
[50:01] but verses verse one in the second year
[50:04] of darius the king and in the second
[50:06] month
[50:06] in the first day of the month came
[50:09] the word of the lord
[50:11] by haggai the prophet unto zerubbabel
[50:14] the son of shatil governor of judah
[50:17] and to joshua the son
[50:20] of joseph the high priest
[50:22] saying
[50:24] thus speaketh the lord of hosts saying
[50:28] this people say
[50:29] the time has not come
[50:31] the time that the lord's house
[50:35] should be built
[50:36] may god bless you bless the reading of
[50:38] the word i'd like to continue reading
[50:40] there if that'd be okay
[50:45] in verse 3
[50:47] the bible says then came
[50:50] the word of the lord
[50:52] by haggai the prophet saying and i want
[50:54] you just to just to catch this very
[50:57] clearly
[50:58] this was not
[51:00] haggai
[51:02] simply
[51:03] quoting
[51:04] what jeremiah had said
[51:07] this was not simply
[51:09] haggai
[51:10] just
[51:11] quoting what isaiah had spoken
[51:15] the word of the lord
[51:17] is the inspiration of the holy spirit
[51:20] that takes what has already been said
[51:24] and declares this is now
[51:28] it takes the spirit of god to come and
[51:31] to bring the word
[51:33] present
[51:35] when he revealed himself to moses at the
[51:37] burning bush
[51:39] he revealed himself as the i am
[51:42] and god will always come and reveal
[51:44] himself as the i am that's that's what
[51:46] he wants to do that's how he comes to do
[51:49] it and that's what we must have in our
[51:51] lives
[51:52] we must have this is why even in in
[51:55] praying as we i've been looking at it on
[51:57] thursday nights
[51:59] give us this day our daily bread
[52:02] and we recognize that that that daily
[52:04] bread we're not talking about wonder
[52:06] bread and nickel bread or french bread
[52:08] or italian bread we're talking about the
[52:10] bread of life which is the staff of life
[52:13] which is the holy spirit which is the
[52:15] word of god made manifest give us this
[52:18] day our daily bread give lord what is
[52:21] needed in my life you know what i have
[52:24] need of lord
[52:25] give to me lord my daily bread yes
[52:30] and so when we look the word of the lord
[52:32] came by
[52:34] haggai the prophet saying now they had
[52:36] the writings
[52:38] but god remember god uses the agency of
[52:42] man
[52:44] now
[52:45] when we look at how that the word of the
[52:47] lord it comes to them and i want to just
[52:49] just go through these verses here just
[52:51] for a few moments
[52:53] notice it says in verse 4
[52:56] is it time for you
[52:58] o ye to dwell in your sealed houses and
[53:01] this house lie waste now i want you to
[53:03] notice
[53:04] the word of the lord the discernment is
[53:07] coming by the word of the lord
[53:09] when the word comes it comes to ask
[53:12] questions not so much that we and
[53:15] ourselves would answer but the word
[53:18] comes with a question for us to reflect
[53:20] who do you say this is
[53:23] he wasn't asking instruct me that what
[53:26] the ministry is that's going on that's
[53:28] not what he was saying when the message
[53:30] was preached in this hour is this the
[53:32] sign of the answers it wasn't a question
[53:35] what do you all think it was god works
[53:37] by questions to cause us to reflect
[53:41] 1964 who do you say this is who is this
[53:45] who is this jesus these are questions
[53:48] that are asked to reflect and consider
[53:51] presently what's taking place
[53:56] so
[53:57] there must come a discernment of the
[53:59] word of the lord and it's got to come
[54:02] and god uses he uses that agency of man
[54:05] now notice in verse 5.
[54:07] now therefore thus saith the lord of
[54:10] hosts consider
[54:12] your ways now here he is
[54:15] this this is already
[54:18] this is not something that's secretive
[54:20] as far as like we're going to uncover
[54:22] things that's in your life but now he's
[54:24] what he's calling him to look at is look
[54:27] at the things that are taking place and
[54:29] i want you to look at him so to think
[54:32] the grace of god would be able to take
[54:34] the people into a place to where now the
[54:37] people can stand and actually begin to
[54:40] watch how their lives have been
[54:42] unfolding
[54:43] and be able to see
[54:45] right where they're at
[54:47] i tell you there's a lot of places we
[54:49] can receive invitation to that we would
[54:51] gladly and man the flesh would say i'll
[54:54] be there
[54:55] like hey
[54:57] samuel today we're going to have steak
[54:58] and lobster tail i'll be there what time
[55:00] you need me to be there let me pick
[55:01] anything up for you
[55:03] but then there's other things that we're
[55:05] invited to
[55:07] that the flesh is not always willing
[55:13] and this is something right here the
[55:15] flesh isn't willing
[55:18] the flesh isn't who isn't willing to
[55:20] come and now where weakness
[55:23] where fault is where things are at but
[55:26] notice the word the word is not
[55:29] contacting the flesh because if the word
[55:31] was contacting the flesh the people
[55:33] would say i don't need to hear this
[55:36] you understand man i i'm working like
[55:38] crazy i don't need to hear this right
[55:40] now
[55:41] but the word of the lord not a letter
[55:44] not a letter the spirit of god the word
[55:47] of the lord
[55:48] is coming and it's contacting the people
[55:51] of god who are the people of the promise
[55:54] it's making a connection and even in
[55:57] that moment to energize them to be able
[55:59] to step into that place
[56:03] if i can say it this way a prophetic
[56:05] realm
[56:08] remind you you and i where we are
[56:10] standing in this hour this this book of
[56:13] revelation
[56:15] the whole book
[56:17] the whole book
[56:18] it is to be revealed
[56:21] only to a special class of people
[56:24] brother branham would say it in this way
[56:26] in that same quote it'll take one with
[56:29] prophetic insight
[56:31] so there had to come
[56:33] a prophetic ministry as ordained by god
[56:36] but remember the prophetic ministry was
[56:39] only to declare where we are at to show
[56:43] us who is present and this is the way to
[56:45] enter in to full relationship
[56:49] is that right
[56:50] the prophet is the veil but you must go
[56:52] behind the veil
[56:55] right the veil is used to declare
[56:59] god is present
[57:02] it's an unveiling of god and it unveils
[57:04] unfolds to you and i that the god who
[57:08] always was is present and he's still the
[57:11] same with the same power same
[57:13] deliverance same healing same baptism of
[57:15] the holy ghost it declares he is here
[57:18] now
[57:21] is that right
[57:24] because in no other age look at every
[57:26] other message to every other church age
[57:28] behold i come quickly behold i come
[57:30] behold but in this last age he said i'm
[57:32] here i stand at the door and not
[57:35] i'm personal right there before your
[57:38] heart knocking at your hearts
[57:41] amen this message it's the coming of the
[57:44] lord
[57:45] it's bringing the coming of the lord
[57:47] down into earth and vessels to prepare
[57:50] for
[57:51] that physical coming
[57:56] is everybody okay
[57:59] thus saith the lord
[58:01] a host consider your ways
[58:04] you have sown much
[58:07] and you bring in little
[58:09] you eat but you have not enough you
[58:11] drink
[58:12] but you're not filled with drink
[58:15] you clothe
[58:16] but none is warm
[58:18] he that earneth wages earneth wages to
[58:21] put it into a bag
[58:23] with holes
[58:25] thus saith the lord of hosts consider
[58:28] your ways
[58:30] i'll say this the word of the lord
[58:32] it's discerned and now it's asking them
[58:36] to reflect consider your ways
[58:38] he's is asking see the word comes while
[58:41] even the word is coming forth even in
[58:43] this moment it's asking you and i will
[58:46] we agree with the word
[58:50] will we take sides with the word
[58:52] remember when brother branham preached
[58:54] that message taking sides with jesus he
[58:56] was making an announcement i'm taking
[58:58] sides with jesus
[59:02] and he lays a lot out in that message
[59:04] for even how that has churches what he
[59:07] sees that coming on he says as the early
[59:09] church started i believe that as that
[59:12] that original branch now comes forth
[59:14] that there will be churches ministry all
[59:17] of those ministerial offices then he
[59:19] breaks it down into the family in that
[59:21] service and he speaks of how he says we
[59:24] don't know how long he'll tarry but we
[59:26] may must make arrangements for our
[59:28] children that are coming on
[59:31] what is all of that that is done by
[59:34] taking sides
[59:35] with jesus
[59:38] so it always the word always comes to a
[59:41] place of agreement you see the word can
[59:43] never move any further in our life
[59:45] unless we agree with it
[59:48] not reason with it agree with it
[59:51] notice he goes on to say in verse 8
[59:54] go up to the mountain and bring wood and
[59:57] build the house and i will take pleasure
[59:59] in it and i will be glorified saith the
[1:00:01] lord so he's letting him know this is my
[1:00:03] will
[1:00:05] this is where i'm pleased
[1:00:08] this is this is where my pleasure
[1:00:11] this is serving my will you see what
[1:00:13] he's letting him know in verse 8 this is
[1:00:16] where you let down
[1:00:19] this is where you've let down through
[1:00:21] pressure
[1:00:22] through conformity
[1:00:25] this is where the letdown has come
[1:00:28] notice in verse 9 you looked for much
[1:00:31] and lo it come to little and when you
[1:00:33] brought it home i did blow upon it
[1:00:37] why
[1:00:38] saith the lord of hosts because of mine
[1:00:41] house that is ways and you run every man
[1:00:44] unto his own house god is occupied with
[1:00:48] his house
[1:00:49] let me just say this his house is not
[1:00:51] made of brick and mortar
[1:00:54] his house is a living mystical body of
[1:00:58] jesus christ
[1:01:00] his house is his word his word is the
[1:01:03] temple where the saints come together
[1:01:06] and worship faith worships in the temple
[1:01:09] of the revealed word
[1:01:11] is that right yes
[1:01:13] so it comes he's calling us god is
[1:01:16] zealous
[1:01:17] let me tell you friends not too many
[1:01:19] people this is why you find
[1:01:21] organizations this is why you find uh
[1:01:25] people on the sidelines because not too
[1:01:27] many people have are built and desire
[1:01:30] this
[1:01:31] so many come to a place and say this is
[1:01:34] enough that's a little overboard that's
[1:01:36] a little too much you're asking for but
[1:01:38] you see god is not going he's not going
[1:01:40] to pet us god's not going to say to you
[1:01:42] or say well you know what i'll lessen a
[1:01:44] little bit you're right this is a hard
[1:01:46] age man it's a bad time pandemic's on
[1:01:48] and whatever gimmick's on and man we'll
[1:01:50] just we'll let we'll loosen it god don't
[1:01:53] operate that way but in the midst of
[1:01:56] chaos in the midst of situation god
[1:01:59] sends his word to bring order to bring
[1:02:02] deliverance to give strength to his
[1:02:05] children to stem the tide and stand toe
[1:02:08] to toe in the face of adversity and say
[1:02:11] is that the best you got
[1:02:16] come on church
[1:02:18] oh come on now
[1:02:21] therefore heaven over you is stayed from
[1:02:24] dew
[1:02:26] and the earth has stayed from her fruit
[1:02:28] and i called for a drought upon the land
[1:02:31] and upon the mountains upon the corn
[1:02:33] upon the new wine upon the oil and upon
[1:02:35] that which the ground bringeth forth and
[1:02:37] upon men and upon cattle and upon all
[1:02:40] the labor of the hands
[1:02:42] oh my
[1:02:44] you're talking about an awakening
[1:02:48] an awakening
[1:02:49] because can you imagine what was on the
[1:02:51] text threads or the facebook posts or
[1:02:53] the twitter accounts being blown up of
[1:02:56] hashtag under persecution
[1:02:59] hashtag i'm trialing it hashtag and god
[1:03:02] lets them know this ain't persecution
[1:03:06] this ain't persecution this isn't
[1:03:08] trialing it
[1:03:10] what's happening i have permitted this
[1:03:13] because you have put other things ahead
[1:03:17] of me
[1:03:19] simple that's what god said that's
[1:03:21] what's going on see god doesn't want him
[1:03:23] to be confused the word comes so that
[1:03:26] we're not walking around in confusion
[1:03:28] and you know given out well i'm under
[1:03:30] trial and i'm under persecution and well
[1:03:32] this is coming my way there are all of
[1:03:34] those folds as we started looking at
[1:03:36] last week there are many folds to
[1:03:39] chastening but in this avenue god is
[1:03:42] bringing correction i mean as a parent
[1:03:44] you we wouldn't be much of a parent if
[1:03:46] you don't correct your children
[1:03:49] come on friends ain't much of a parent
[1:03:51] and i'm not talking about when they get
[1:03:53] on your nerves i'm talking about
[1:03:55] correction with if this goes on like
[1:03:57] this now
[1:03:58] god help us when they get older
[1:04:02] come on friends if they throw a temper
[1:04:04] tantrum now they'll be throwing a temper
[1:04:06] tantrum when they get older
[1:04:09] preach brother
[1:04:11] think a will
[1:04:14] so the question arises this is where the
[1:04:16] question arises
[1:04:19] god has let them know
[1:04:21] hey
[1:04:22] all this that you've been putting out
[1:04:24] there
[1:04:25] it's been me i stayed the dude
[1:04:28] i stopped all this
[1:04:30] your labor you weren't lazy you were
[1:04:32] working like crazy
[1:04:34] even your money when you brought it in
[1:04:36] your income has been increased but when
[1:04:38] it's been laid down
[1:04:41] i blew upon it
[1:04:43] now god permitted it
[1:04:46] now once you think about this you say
[1:04:48] man by the same if that's awful strong
[1:04:51] correction is never something
[1:04:54] that's enjoyable
[1:04:55] for the season
[1:04:58] it's never enjoyable for the season but
[1:05:01] afterward
[1:05:03] it'll yield present
[1:05:05] pleasant fruits
[1:05:07] afterwards those that would be exercised
[1:05:09] by it i want you to think of it are they
[1:05:11] going to
[1:05:12] to receive the correction
[1:05:15] of the word of god
[1:05:17] this is really unfolded pretty plain
[1:05:19] before
[1:05:21] i feel like this is i don't just feel i
[1:05:23] know by the leading of the holy spirit
[1:05:25] that this is this is so present with
[1:05:27] where we're at in this age
[1:05:29] let me just say this to you friends
[1:05:31] every one of us in here this is why the
[1:05:34] holy ghost is not an option
[1:05:36] the holy ghost is not an option in our
[1:05:38] lives personally by the new birth and
[1:05:41] the holy ghost is not an option in our
[1:05:43] services
[1:05:44] the holy ghost is not optional daily
[1:05:47] living by the word of god and praying
[1:05:49] it's not an option
[1:05:51] it's an hour to be very very fervent you
[1:05:54] say why do you say that because we need
[1:05:57] the discernment by the word of almighty
[1:06:00] god without his discernment we're just
[1:06:03] like these individuals are we begin to
[1:06:05] call things okay good and all this is
[1:06:08] going on instead of really identifying
[1:06:10] what's the real problem going on here
[1:06:14] i want to say this
[1:06:16] how many people look uh psalm 73 asap
[1:06:20] asap was a let's say a song leader he
[1:06:22] was a leading musician there in in in in
[1:06:24] in the time of of david
[1:06:27] he began to look at everybody else man
[1:06:29] these guys are prospering man this is
[1:06:31] good the green bay the green bay tree
[1:06:34] prospers
[1:06:35] man look at them everything the wicked
[1:06:37] look how they're doing it man the test
[1:06:40] and the trout
[1:06:41] asap said he got his eyes on that and he
[1:06:43] said my foot had slipped
[1:06:47] he got his eyes on the wrong thing
[1:06:48] because it looked like man they're
[1:06:50] prospering they're everything going
[1:06:52] their way everything looks good but asap
[1:06:54] said once i came into the sanctuary
[1:06:59] then i understood the end of that you
[1:07:03] see just looking at it in the natural it
[1:07:05] looks like everything's going their way
[1:07:08] man that because this flesh always wants
[1:07:10] the easy way
[1:07:12] this flesh does every one of our flesh
[1:07:15] it don't matter what your dna is every
[1:07:17] one of our flesh wants the easy way
[1:07:20] but takes god there thanks be to god
[1:07:22] there is a part of himself on the inside
[1:07:25] when he would make himself known in this
[1:07:28] hour that would rise up and choose the
[1:07:31] harder way
[1:07:32] and every moment every moment every
[1:07:35] moment is choosing the harder way
[1:07:38] every day of our life is a choice
[1:07:40] every moment of our life is a decision
[1:07:43] choosing the harder way
[1:07:46] are you hearing me now
[1:07:48] overcoming is not us being pulled
[1:07:50] through a pipe
[1:07:51] it's choices we make
[1:07:54] sometimes we make the choices that are
[1:07:55] good other times we make the choices
[1:07:58] that are wrong
[1:08:03] oh my
[1:08:04] you might be thinking boy
[1:08:06] can't wait for fellowship to start
[1:08:13] but this the question arises
[1:08:15] are they going to receive correction
[1:08:16] from the word because i want you to
[1:08:18] think the rich young ruler
[1:08:20] he came jesus loved him
[1:08:23] jesus said it like this putting it in
[1:08:25] the words of the prophet and the message
[1:08:27] come follow me
[1:08:28] you said he was a model young man
[1:08:31] a respectful young man
[1:08:33] he would be a young man that probably
[1:08:35] somebody would say boy i'd like my
[1:08:36] daughter to date that guy he's a he's a
[1:08:38] he's a he's a worker man he's got a good
[1:08:41] 401k i don't care if he's got a 401k i
[1:08:44] don't care if he's got diamond studded
[1:08:46] wheels does he got the holy ghost
[1:08:50] because all those other things will
[1:08:52] perish
[1:08:53] but if you've got true riches on the
[1:08:55] inside let me tell you something
[1:08:56] there'll be glory in that castle brother
[1:09:00] there'll be glory there'll be joy
[1:09:02] unspeakable there'll be a stabilizing in
[1:09:06] that home when testing trials comes
[1:09:08] there's an anchor there's an anchor and
[1:09:11] absolute that that home is held together
[1:09:13] by the presence of almighty god
[1:09:16] oh my
[1:09:19] think of it this correction because the
[1:09:20] richer and ruler he went on
[1:09:22] man he he's after after face to face
[1:09:25] with the lord jesus he went on he said
[1:09:27] man everything's going good
[1:09:29] he started building bigger barns
[1:09:32] is that right
[1:09:33] come on the prophet of god ties those
[1:09:34] two together
[1:09:36] he brings that two together
[1:09:38] brother man brings us to the place to
[1:09:40] show us he said notice what he said when
[1:09:42] he lifted up his eyes in hell it came
[1:09:44] back to him when he was in hell and
[1:09:46] that's what hell is really a torment is
[1:09:49] when a person has to reflect and it's
[1:09:51] before before him before him you had an
[1:09:53] opportunity you had a choice you didn't
[1:09:56] move on it you didn't act on it that's
[1:09:57] torment
[1:10:01] because hell isn't the lake of fire hell
[1:10:04] is the place
[1:10:05] like the county jail
[1:10:08] indictment has been made and it's
[1:10:10] awaiting the trial of the white throne
[1:10:12] judgment
[1:10:13] is that right god never sins god never
[1:10:16] sends a man into that place of the lake
[1:10:18] of fire without the first being a tribe
[1:10:22] is that right
[1:10:24] so i'd say it like this
[1:10:26] it's a blessing
[1:10:28] god bringing correction to our life
[1:10:31] and when we can agree with it
[1:10:34] and yield to it
[1:10:40] you see the real problem that was going
[1:10:42] on in the lives and the hearts
[1:10:45] because how many knows is faith that
[1:10:47] operates
[1:10:48] every promise of god
[1:10:50] it's faith that operates your life
[1:10:54] faith is
[1:10:56] what an awakening they had when this
[1:10:58] would come forth to their life
[1:11:01] because
[1:11:02] the real problem was a lack of faith
[1:11:05] now that would seem in our in our in our
[1:11:08] minds how could it be a lack of faith
[1:11:10] they were standing against the
[1:11:11] adversaries in the beginning but
[1:11:13] remember in the message perfect faith
[1:11:15] brother random takes us to peter
[1:11:17] stepping out of the boat and he said
[1:11:19] peter when he stepped out of the boat
[1:11:22] had substance faith
[1:11:26] are you hearing me now
[1:11:27] but he started looking at the waves and
[1:11:30] he began this is the words of the
[1:11:32] prophet begin to lose
[1:11:34] substance
[1:11:37] why his focus was on the wrong thing
[1:11:41] and the focus at first was it's him
[1:11:45] it's him i want to go to him i want to
[1:11:47] go and lord bid me to come come peter
[1:11:50] stepped out of the boat not even not
[1:11:52] even hesitating but as he started to
[1:11:54] walk the waves around him rising up he
[1:11:57] started to focus upon the waves
[1:12:01] the word that spoke to him and said come
[1:12:04] peter that word was above every wave
[1:12:10] it didn't even stop these begin to
[1:12:11] consider here i am i'm there i'm walking
[1:12:14] in a place that this is not even
[1:12:16] conventional to thinking but what was
[1:12:19] happening the more that he entertained
[1:12:21] it
[1:12:22] he began to lose substance faith
[1:12:29] peter one thing about peter wasn't too
[1:12:31] ashamed to raise up his hand and say
[1:12:34] help me lord save me lest i perish
[1:12:43] oh glory brother bantam you're aware you
[1:12:46] take the message desperation brother
[1:12:47] brown will take that exact thought and
[1:12:49] he'll apply it with hearts and lives
[1:12:51] that have been struck with sickness then
[1:12:53] he'll also apply it to lies that he said
[1:12:55] they've come a mistake has been made
[1:12:57] he'll also apply it we're lives that
[1:12:59] haven't went fully on into the baptism
[1:13:01] of the holy ghost but he's bringing it
[1:13:03] and he says may i encourage you this
[1:13:05] morning to take a hold of the promises
[1:13:07] of god that belong to you because satan
[1:13:10] is nothing but a bluff
[1:13:13] i'm tell you this word is not a backup
[1:13:15] plan
[1:13:18] this word is not a compromising word
[1:13:20] this word is a said this belongs to me
[1:13:23] it belongs to the kingdom of god and i'm
[1:13:26] here to take what rightfully belongs to
[1:13:29] me no peace treaty get the peace tables
[1:13:31] out of here because we ain't making no
[1:13:34] peace pack
[1:13:40] it's like a situation like this could
[1:13:41] arise around our lives think about it in
[1:13:43] the natural
[1:13:45] sometimes the things that arise and we
[1:13:47] think
[1:13:48] man what's going on in our body
[1:13:51] right
[1:13:52] and of course you know we go to resident
[1:13:54] dr google
[1:14:02] or better yet some of us try to
[1:14:05] i'm feeling a little sick um you got
[1:14:07] antibiotics
[1:14:11] i agree with you boy you could stand up
[1:14:13] here and rebuke that right now couldn't
[1:14:14] you
[1:14:16] nursing man
[1:14:20] come on now
[1:14:21] sometimes you know we're you know
[1:14:23] looking at things here and there and and
[1:14:25] friends we all know this one of the
[1:14:27] things that's just like with all the the
[1:14:28] medicines and things like that it only
[1:14:30] many times it works and it's only
[1:14:32] masking
[1:14:34] what conditions are on the surface and
[1:14:36] never really getting down to what's
[1:14:38] going on inwardly
[1:14:41] you see when you sit down with the
[1:14:42] doctor that you tell the doctor i'm
[1:14:44] having a pain here i'm going to cramp
[1:14:45] there i'm having this or i'm getting
[1:14:46] dizzy here i'm getting you know and you
[1:14:48] know they're saying they'll they're
[1:14:49] they're listening to what you're saying
[1:14:51] there's also things maybe pressure
[1:14:53] points whenever you know what i'm
[1:14:54] talking about you they can only respond
[1:14:57] upon what you are sensing or feeling
[1:14:59] outwardly then they begin to then take
[1:15:02] that and apply their knowledge to try to
[1:15:05] determine what is causing these outward
[1:15:09] symptoms
[1:15:11] well well well well we are in the
[1:15:14] presence of dr jesus
[1:15:18] i'm telling you there's no doubt if we
[1:15:20] could re-read haggai chapter one they
[1:15:23] were taking the tylenols nothing wrong
[1:15:25] the advils and somebody else's
[1:15:27] antibiotic and oh man i got this is
[1:15:29] going on and this is going on what they
[1:15:31] needed was is some real examination
[1:15:35] to get down to what's going on
[1:15:39] sometimes when you hear the ministering
[1:15:41] of the word the chastening of the lord
[1:15:43] that brings correction on getting slack
[1:15:46] and you know coming to the house of god
[1:15:48] praying and reading let me tell you
[1:15:50] something that is not a minister trying
[1:15:52] to get you to measure up with their
[1:15:54] standard this is the standard of the
[1:15:56] word and it's things that you can see
[1:15:58] outwardly that speak there's something
[1:16:01] going on inwardly
[1:16:05] and the only way god can help us we've
[1:16:07] got to be honest with him
[1:16:11] hallelujah friends
[1:16:13] oh my i want you just to think of this
[1:16:16] in haggai chapter 5 verse 1
[1:16:19] the bible said then
[1:16:21] the prophets
[1:16:23] haggai the prophet and zechariah the son
[1:16:25] of edu
[1:16:26] prophesied unto the jews that were in
[1:16:28] judah and jerusalem in the name of the
[1:16:31] god of israel even unto them
[1:16:34] then rose up jerubal the son of shatil
[1:16:37] and jeshua the son of josedec and began
[1:16:40] to build the house of god which is at
[1:16:42] jerusalem and with them were the
[1:16:44] prophets of god helping them
[1:16:47] now i want to just say this i want to
[1:16:48] say it to you
[1:16:50] this scripture here in ezra five
[1:16:53] is the parallel of what's taking place
[1:16:54] in hagiai one
[1:16:56] hadiyai and zechariah were not major
[1:17:00] prophets they were minor prophets
[1:17:04] but they were moved by the word of the
[1:17:06] lord and notice it wasn't a new word
[1:17:10] it wasn't a new vision
[1:17:12] it wasn't a well we can't do it this way
[1:17:14] so we'll go around this way no god won't
[1:17:17] change his program
[1:17:20] god's program remains the same
[1:17:23] when god instituted or brought forth
[1:17:25] even the program there on the day of
[1:17:28] pentecost remember that's the same
[1:17:30] program that is applied right now in
[1:17:33] this present time that you and i are
[1:17:35] living in
[1:17:38] let me give me a little bit more juice
[1:17:39] up here brothers
[1:17:41] so i want you to think of this the
[1:17:43] prophets they spoke in the name the
[1:17:44] characteristic
[1:17:46] the very character of almighty god
[1:17:50] the name of god this is his word
[1:17:52] revealed calling it back that this is
[1:17:55] what god expects to be done now once you
[1:17:57] think of this for a moment think of this
[1:17:59] they need an examination by the word
[1:18:03] they don't need a pep rally
[1:18:05] pep rally ain't going to do it
[1:18:08] they need an examination by the word i
[1:18:10] hope you're hearing me now the word of
[1:18:12] god when the spirit of god is moving
[1:18:14] it's not a pep rally it's a time for
[1:18:17] examination in our lives
[1:18:20] is that right you can be right under the
[1:18:22] anointing of the holy spirit but you've
[1:18:24] got to welcome him in and welcome it in
[1:18:27] to examine in your life it's not just
[1:18:29] about boy that was a good service my i
[1:18:31] felt the presence of god it's about
[1:18:33] bringing it home and saying god where am
[1:18:36] i at in my life where in my life can
[1:18:39] there be growth lord
[1:18:43] these are the prophets standing here it
[1:18:45] would be this right here would be the
[1:18:48] equating like that of the ministry of
[1:18:51] ephesians 4 under
[1:18:53] under the ministry of jeremiah
[1:18:56] under the ministry of daniel
[1:19:00] see god is a god of order
[1:19:03] like when micah came up there and they
[1:19:06] brought mike up there remember ahab said
[1:19:08] i don't want him up here
[1:19:11] i like all these guys that pat me on the
[1:19:13] back tell me what a good guy i am i hate
[1:19:15] that guy every time i go to hear him he
[1:19:18] gets wrapped down in my life that was
[1:19:20] the chastening of the lord
[1:19:24] and ahab despised let me tell you what
[1:19:26] that was it was the spirit of grace
[1:19:29] grace listen grace is not what the
[1:19:32] church world defines it grace defines
[1:19:34] the everything the church world defines
[1:19:36] grace and what is it it's a prostitute
[1:19:40] it becomes an unclean woman it becomes
[1:19:43] somebody that can show up to church and
[1:19:45] live any other kind of life oh god's got
[1:19:47] a lot of grace that's not true grace the
[1:19:50] bible says there in hebrews 12 let us
[1:19:53] have grace that we might serve him
[1:19:56] acceptably it's grace that comes that
[1:19:59] tells us where we're wrong it's grace
[1:20:01] that comes down and brings correction in
[1:20:04] our life that's grace
[1:20:07] but it all depends on whether we'll
[1:20:08] receive that grace
[1:20:13] that's not how the world defines grace
[1:20:18] but i don't think there's any i know
[1:20:21] there's no better mri
[1:20:23] than the word of god
[1:20:26] i know a lot of people i've been through
[1:20:28] the tube myself you know
[1:20:29] you go in there and they had to you know
[1:20:31] look at my back you know about 16 years
[1:20:33] ago you've been they tell you to bring
[1:20:35] music in or whatever more and you know
[1:20:36] you're in that tube and it's
[1:20:43] your god help me
[1:20:47] but that's what we need by the word of
[1:20:48] god
[1:20:50] we need an mri that can get an imaging
[1:20:53] that sees all around
[1:20:57] friends listen that's not comfortable to
[1:21:00] our flesh but this is a time to discern
[1:21:02] between the flesh and the spirit
[1:21:06] the flesh will never side with the word
[1:21:08] but the inner man on the inside there's
[1:21:11] a desire to line up with that word
[1:21:14] there's times where you got to tell your
[1:21:15] flesh shut up and sit down
[1:21:20] and i'm talking about your feelings my
[1:21:22] feelings our attitude you got to say
[1:21:24] shut up
[1:21:26] i'm put in charge here not you
[1:21:29] they that are the sons of god are led by
[1:21:31] their feelings no that's not what it
[1:21:33] said that might be the new whatever
[1:21:35] translation but then but the real word
[1:21:38] of god said the spirit of god is led the
[1:21:40] sons of god are led by the spirit of god
[1:21:43] is that right
[1:21:45] we need that mri the word of god in
[1:21:47] hebrews 4 coming down
[1:21:50] and really bringing discernment
[1:21:52] into our lives
[1:21:54] piercing getting down to where it's at
[1:21:57] to expose and and what's going on
[1:22:00] remember you know i've made this
[1:22:02] statement to you here throughout the
[1:22:04] times that we've been ministering and
[1:22:07] uh you know just just as we're going
[1:22:09] just following his leading
[1:22:11] but brother branham you're aware of how
[1:22:12] brother brandon would take about this
[1:22:14] nation that we live in
[1:22:16] and he ties it together even with
[1:22:18] organizational life he says
[1:22:20] we're living off of a past reputation
[1:22:25] i mean this nation still calls
[1:22:27] themselves a christian nation what a lie
[1:22:31] yes sir
[1:22:32] it's not a christian nation
[1:22:38] but why are they doing that they're
[1:22:39] looking back to something
[1:22:43] but god never respects
[1:22:46] goes by and judges us based on what we
[1:22:50] were it's what we are now
[1:22:54] because remember brother brown picks
[1:22:55] that that quote up and he says god never
[1:22:58] respected israel for what they was it's
[1:23:02] for what they are now
[1:23:06] this is why let me just say it like this
[1:23:10] when they said the time has not come
[1:23:14] that was their thinking
[1:23:17] that was not god's thoughts
[1:23:20] their thoughts their reasoning have
[1:23:22] begin to take preeminence in their life
[1:23:24] look at the result
[1:23:26] the result of reasoning in the beginning
[1:23:29] led to the fall
[1:23:30] the results of reasoning leads to
[1:23:33] pushing the promises of god away because
[1:23:37] man is looking at can he bring the
[1:23:40] promise to pass it's not can man bring
[1:23:43] it to pass it's god who made the promise
[1:23:45] it's god who'll bring it to pass all god
[1:23:48] asks for his lives that's willing to
[1:23:50] yield and submit and surrender and like
[1:23:53] mary be it unto me lord
[1:23:56] according to that word god never asked
[1:23:58] you and i to fulfill the word
[1:24:00] god is the one who interprets the word
[1:24:02] by bringing it to pass he's the one that
[1:24:05] fulfills it and the bride remember pick
[1:24:07] up your pen and write the bride knows
[1:24:10] that it must be him inside of her
[1:24:13] fulfilling the word of god
[1:24:19] so a past reputation that's why
[1:24:22] we must be the people of now
[1:24:25] somebody say now
[1:24:27] there's a lot i wish i could preach a
[1:24:28] message
[1:24:29] i've looked at that for
[1:24:30] a long time the people of now
[1:24:35] in one time a vision
[1:24:36] no longer vision prophecy fulfilled
[1:24:40] is that right standing at the river
[1:24:42] jordan what was one time prophecy
[1:24:45] now was history
[1:24:48] is that right
[1:24:49] brother random identifies that and what
[1:24:50] is the attraction on the mount he said
[1:24:52] what was one time prophecy remember it
[1:24:54] was being announced prophecy then he
[1:24:57] could be able to declare standing at
[1:24:59] that moment it's no longer prophecy it's
[1:25:01] history
[1:25:03] it's taken place now
[1:25:05] that word moves into the bride body
[1:25:11] so if we're the bride of jesus christ
[1:25:13] the word manifested in this hour and
[1:25:14] that's
[1:25:16] that's the manifestation of the hour
[1:25:18] is the bride of jesus christ
[1:25:20] yeah that's that's a man
[1:25:23] then
[1:25:24] now
[1:25:25] are we the sons of god
[1:25:28] now is the time of salvation
[1:25:30] now
[1:25:31] is the time of rapture we're not living
[1:25:33] in the time of promise we're living in
[1:25:34] the time of fulfillment now
[1:25:39] that's that's how
[1:25:40] our lives
[1:25:42] listen friends if we can really take
[1:25:43] this in and i'm just
[1:25:45] just just following here
[1:25:47] we really take it into our lives and
[1:25:49] live our lives
[1:25:51] now
[1:25:53] living every moment
[1:25:55] is if he came the next moment
[1:25:58] we're living close to him
[1:26:00] we're people of the now
[1:26:04] let me tell you friends in this hour
[1:26:07] i'd be very straight
[1:26:09] but loosely following the lord you're
[1:26:12] going to be left behind
[1:26:15] you've got to get all the way into jesus
[1:26:18] christ
[1:26:21] i'm not just talking about going along
[1:26:23] with it mentally and saying we believe
[1:26:25] it remember a doctor looks at symptoms
[1:26:29] you can't ignore symptoms
[1:26:33] right i know sometimes we you know we go
[1:26:35] around and we have symptoms that when
[1:26:37] did you take something did you do this
[1:26:39] hey you need to go see the doctor i
[1:26:40] don't want to see the doctor
[1:26:42] right unless we don't want to go through
[1:26:44] the trouble because we might say you
[1:26:45] need some tests done
[1:26:47] come on friends it happens you know
[1:26:51] somebody looks and says hey that's days
[1:26:53] off work man
[1:26:56] nobody wants to do it
[1:26:58] you know where there's tests in right
[1:27:00] injecting dye and twisting this here and
[1:27:02] doing this here and doing that there
[1:27:06] but if they're interested in you've got
[1:27:08] to get to the root of the problem
[1:27:11] that's what this message came to do
[1:27:13] is to really get to the root of the
[1:27:15] problem
[1:27:17] so brother samuel how can you say that
[1:27:19] because in revelations 3 they believe
[1:27:22] the spirit says i'm rich and i don't
[1:27:24] have need of nothing
[1:27:29] let me preach now can i preach
[1:27:31] that same spirit is a spirit of this age
[1:27:34] it doesn't stay out there and say well i
[1:27:37] don't leave the barriers of the
[1:27:38] methodist church i won't leave the
[1:27:40] barriers of the catholic church that
[1:27:42] same spirit comes right amongst this
[1:27:44] message
[1:27:47] i've got the message i've got a computer
[1:27:49] i've got the quotes i know the message i
[1:27:51] know who are you same spirit i am rich
[1:27:54] and increased with goods and i don't
[1:27:56] have need of nothing
[1:27:59] in other words i don't need rebuke i
[1:28:02] don't need chastening i don't need
[1:28:04] corrected i get the leading of the holy
[1:28:06] ghost from myself
[1:28:12] heaven sounding sweeter
[1:28:15] it's true friends
[1:28:17] we're living in this time those are not
[1:28:19] that's not comfortable it's not even
[1:28:21] comfortable having to say it and preach
[1:28:24] it but it's necessary in this hour
[1:28:28] these walls don't keep spirits out
[1:28:31] your knowledge of the message don't keep
[1:28:34] demons away
[1:28:35] it takes the living presence of the
[1:28:38] living fire of almighty god baptizing
[1:28:42] you on the inside in your soul
[1:28:47] come on friends
[1:28:50] the same cherubim that stood there at
[1:28:52] the gate in eden and would not permit
[1:28:55] entrance back to the tree of life that
[1:28:58] same anointing are you hearing me now
[1:29:01] that same anointing is upon the bride of
[1:29:04] jesus christ
[1:29:06] it's a bride that's standing there upon
[1:29:09] this word oh she's terrible as an army
[1:29:12] with banners
[1:29:14] a beautiful arrayed in the righteousness
[1:29:16] of jesus christ but she's going to stand
[1:29:19] on the word of god and the word will not
[1:29:22] be compromised because she's promised
[1:29:25] there is a rapture on
[1:29:38] daniel curry i remember brother brown
[1:29:40] talked about daniel curry
[1:29:46] that's why
[1:29:47] i think how the lord's put it very close
[1:29:48] to us here we don't need a picture we
[1:29:52] don't need a picture we need a mirror
[1:29:56] i need a mirror a mirror that shows the
[1:29:58] now
[1:30:02] because there's a lot of things we can
[1:30:03] talk about of the past
[1:30:08] i want you to think of this
[1:30:10] there was victories in the past
[1:30:12] but you got to have victory today
[1:30:16] you don't get victory today from
[1:30:19] living off victories in the past
[1:30:23] that's only a mirage
[1:30:25] that only comes down to what it is in
[1:30:26] haggai one where you know what they're
[1:30:28] just going day by day listen you're not
[1:30:30] meant just to live well just i'm just
[1:30:32] living day by day if i can just oh i
[1:30:35] tell you church just i want you all just
[1:30:37] to have a praise break with me i made it
[1:30:39] to church this morning shame on you
[1:30:43] nobody feels like well glory to god you
[1:30:45] made it to church this morning everybody
[1:30:47] had the press to be here
[1:30:50] ain't no pats on the back for that
[1:30:53] if you really love god you will be in
[1:30:56] the house of god you'll do everything
[1:30:59] you can to be here not because of these
[1:31:02] walls but because of him
[1:31:05] him
[1:31:06] him and you see the value
[1:31:08] of that in our lives
[1:31:14] i know we're living in an hour right now
[1:31:16] where streaming has substituted
[1:31:18] in-person worship
[1:31:20] but that is not scriptural
[1:31:23] preach brother samuel oh i will
[1:31:26] i will
[1:31:27] it has not and we see it all around it
[1:31:30] has wanted to substitute i'm telling you
[1:31:32] the devil's a sly he's a sly fellow
[1:31:36] what's he trying to do isolate and cut
[1:31:38] away from the body of jesus christ
[1:31:42] let me tell you something i felt the
[1:31:44] presence of god my wife testified to it
[1:31:46] when i had to stand here and preach to
[1:31:48] empty pews and a few brothers that were
[1:31:50] here you know with me at that time and
[1:31:52] different ones running slides she could
[1:31:54] testify to it as well as some of you all
[1:31:56] and i remember sister anna you know
[1:31:58] saying to me the the question one time i
[1:32:00] said brother sammy you're preaching like
[1:32:02] there's a whole house full there i said
[1:32:03] well you know what it's just how god has
[1:32:05] sovereignly worked it at that moment
[1:32:10] god sovereignly worked it at that moment
[1:32:12] needs were being met are you hearing me
[1:32:14] now
[1:32:15] but you recognize that within all of
[1:32:17] this right here there was god had given
[1:32:19] grace and we felt the presence of god
[1:32:22] but friends we are ordained to be a body
[1:32:25] of believers
[1:32:28] now i realize i realize you can preach
[1:32:30] on these things and you know sometimes
[1:32:32] people get ruffled they get all this and
[1:32:34] that and then you have my you know start
[1:32:36] coming for a while then fade back around
[1:32:38] but real listen the reality is a doctor
[1:32:41] is only identifying symptoms
[1:32:44] we're not giving tylenols and advils
[1:32:46] we're trying to point you there's
[1:32:48] something lacking there there's
[1:32:51] something in the way be sure that you've
[1:32:54] taken the medicine fully in your life
[1:32:58] when they give you medicine you know how
[1:33:00] they usually tell you 10 days right
[1:33:02] 14 days sometimes you look at those
[1:33:04] pills they could graces how many times a
[1:33:06] day 42 times a day 10 days
[1:33:10] here you are walking around with your
[1:33:11] home depot homer bucket got my pills
[1:33:13] with me today
[1:33:16] right
[1:33:17] come on let's be honest now
[1:33:19] oh by day four we're like
[1:33:22] i'm feeling pretty good man
[1:33:25] no no sniffles i'm good to go
[1:33:28] we'll pull back from that antibiotic
[1:33:30] still got six days left
[1:33:34] sometimes the symptoms come back
[1:33:37] then again the other time the thing that
[1:33:38] hit us is only stronger the next time
[1:33:40] and more resistance
[1:33:42] because it didn't get killed off all the
[1:33:44] way before are you healing me now
[1:33:46] this is why when brother adam preaches
[1:33:48] the message token in jeffersonville he
[1:33:50] refers in the beginning middle and in to
[1:33:52] the token being the medicine that is
[1:33:55] right before us and if you take the
[1:33:57] medicine fully into your life it's there
[1:34:00] to apply to every situation that comes
[1:34:04] by it'll address let me tell you
[1:34:06] something these pills brother are not
[1:34:08] some cheap generic pills these pills
[1:34:11] pack the original potent power of the
[1:34:14] holy ghost i'm telling you these pills
[1:34:17] brother they are full of the antivenom
[1:34:20] that reacts and takes on that serpent
[1:34:22] bite that curse that was there in our
[1:34:25] life if we could just take the medicine
[1:34:39] so brother samuel i'm saying we need to
[1:34:41] evaluate what we're doing
[1:34:43] we need to evaluate what we're doing we
[1:34:44] need to listen friends this is the bible
[1:34:47] we need to speak plainly
[1:34:49] in the book of habakkuk write the vision
[1:34:51] plainly that he that readeth may run
[1:34:54] god wrote it plainly in this hour he
[1:34:56] interpreted it plainly
[1:34:58] why that we might rotten
[1:35:01] there's a time in an hour we must speak
[1:35:03] with vagueness with not vague but
[1:35:05] plainness in this hour
[1:35:13] daniel curry my goodness how did we get
[1:35:15] away from daniel curry
[1:35:18] but i want you to think about daniel
[1:35:19] curry just for a moment i
[1:35:21] this was drawn to this even some weeks
[1:35:23] ago just thinking
[1:35:25] because daniel curry
[1:35:28] remember he the brother bram dramatized
[1:35:31] that he stood before
[1:35:32] the gate
[1:35:35] and he's it's a drama
[1:35:37] standing there and
[1:35:40] you know comes the angel comes to the
[1:35:41] gate and says who are you
[1:35:43] i'm daniel curry okay let me looking in
[1:35:46] the
[1:35:48] let me see here see
[1:35:50] curry
[1:35:55] we don't find anything here and we know
[1:35:57] this is a drama
[1:36:01] but he's standing there
[1:36:03] brother bram says about that time how
[1:36:04] daniel curry described the dream
[1:36:07] he said he was taken
[1:36:09] into the presence of that light and he
[1:36:10] said that light
[1:36:12] became so bright
[1:36:15] and in the presence of that light as he
[1:36:16] stood there
[1:36:18] this is daniel curry his testimony of
[1:36:20] the dream he said
[1:36:22] when he was asked
[1:36:23] pointed questions
[1:36:25] did you ever lie
[1:36:27] did you ever steal
[1:36:29] did you ever
[1:36:30] and he said
[1:36:32] i thought
[1:36:34] i had never
[1:36:35] but in the presence of that light
[1:36:39] i realized i had
[1:36:42] so what does light do it exposes
[1:36:48] he said i thought on and on daniel curry
[1:36:50] went i thought i thought but i realized
[1:36:53] this is why
[1:36:55] that we must have the light of the hour
[1:36:59] shining down in our lives
[1:37:02] i never forget my daddy one time went to
[1:37:04] a
[1:37:05] situation that people that weren't
[1:37:08] you know they
[1:37:10] you know they lay out a church didn't
[1:37:12] want to come in and they've got you know
[1:37:13] a tongue to give and a prophecy to give
[1:37:15] and everything
[1:37:16] and so my daddy just went there and he
[1:37:18] told him he said look he said any
[1:37:20] prophecy or tongues that's for you
[1:37:23] that's for you don't bring them into the
[1:37:25] church that's for you now my daddy went
[1:37:27] against tongues in prophecy he believed
[1:37:29] in it
[1:37:30] but for you to sit home and then come in
[1:37:31] like you're more spiritual than
[1:37:32] everybody else though anything you get
[1:37:34] from god that's for you
[1:37:35] look in the mirror and recite it
[1:37:38] you know my dad was a he could be very
[1:37:40] plain spoken but god had him here for a
[1:37:42] reason and for a purpose and for a
[1:37:43] season
[1:37:45] is that right but here's what was said
[1:37:48] you know my dad mentioned to the to the
[1:37:50] to to the individual and i'm saying this
[1:37:52] plainly not to disclose things privacy
[1:37:54] i'm showing you i want to show you
[1:37:55] something is pressed on my heart that
[1:37:57] when my dad said you were he said
[1:37:59] brother bannon tells us not to forsake
[1:38:02] from the scriptures not to forsake to
[1:38:03] assemble ourselves together if you've
[1:38:04] got the love of god in your heart you
[1:38:06] can't wait for those church doors to
[1:38:07] open
[1:38:09] and the individuals rose up and said
[1:38:13] that doesn't bother me when he says it
[1:38:16] but when you say it it makes me mad
[1:38:22] credible in there
[1:38:24] why what's the difference when the word
[1:38:26] is standing in flesh
[1:38:28] and discerning now
[1:38:31] conditions
[1:38:33] i tell you only the bride can stand in
[1:38:35] the now
[1:38:37] the now isn't an easy place to stand
[1:38:40] but now is a place of examination by the
[1:38:43] word
[1:38:44] as many as i love not as many as love me
[1:38:48] as many as i love
[1:38:50] i chasten and rebuke
[1:38:54] be zealous therefore and repent
[1:38:58] it's about the word coming down and the
[1:39:01] word bringing discernment in reality i
[1:39:04] think back on that time with my dad my
[1:39:06] daddy wasn't against he's trying to help
[1:39:08] the individual to see the present
[1:39:11] conditions we are in
[1:39:15] of course we're living even in a greater
[1:39:16] time right now 2022. everything you do
[1:39:19] it's got to be politically correct
[1:39:22] right
[1:39:24] everything's got to be you know
[1:39:25] sweetened with powdered sugar powdered
[1:39:27] sugar and they call that love listen
[1:39:29] friends love is corrective we can be we
[1:39:31] can go to the bush and beat the leaves
[1:39:33] off of it and never address the mites
[1:39:36] that's eating on it we've got to address
[1:39:39] what's eating on the bush
[1:39:44] when symptoms are coming up in our life
[1:39:46] sin is coming out i'm not talking about
[1:39:48] going out and grabbing a fifth of
[1:39:50] whiskey or running out to the bar room
[1:39:52] i'm talking about unbelief and unbelief
[1:39:55] displays itself when it doesn't walk
[1:39:58] according to the word of almighty god
[1:40:02] simple things that god has asked us to
[1:40:04] do
[1:40:05] and it's up to us whether or not
[1:40:08] that will we will heed to it
[1:40:11] can i have just a few more moments
[1:40:17] i want you to understand this
[1:40:20] their expectation
[1:40:25] my friends i thank god for his mercy for
[1:40:27] our lives
[1:40:28] can you think what
[1:40:30] these are people of god but just wait
[1:40:33] they've got the promise of deuteronomy
[1:40:34] 28 if you hearken unto my voice if you
[1:40:38] follow my commandments diligently i will
[1:40:40] bless your seed i will water your land i
[1:40:43] will provide the dew from heaven oh the
[1:40:46] blessings of god i will
[1:40:48] all those natural blessings
[1:40:52] and they were in the process of thinking
[1:40:55] you know what i just need to do more
[1:40:57] i need to do more
[1:40:59] i need to do more
[1:41:01] and what they what really they they got
[1:41:03] away from
[1:41:04] is surrendering to the will of god
[1:41:07] can i preach for just a moment when
[1:41:09] brother branham preaches the message
[1:41:11] enticing spirits
[1:41:13] hear me now
[1:41:14] brother brown when he preaches that
[1:41:15] message he talks about people they'll go
[1:41:17] for gifts
[1:41:19] they'll study intensely
[1:41:21] they'll fast he said they'll do all of
[1:41:24] that instead of surrendering to the word
[1:41:26] of god
[1:41:27] because to surrender to the word of god
[1:41:29] you've got to surrender your nature and
[1:41:32] your will
[1:41:34] all the studying all the fasting all the
[1:41:36] praying now i'm talking on things that
[1:41:38] your eye would look at and say man what
[1:41:40] are you talking about doing when you
[1:41:42] want people to study when you want
[1:41:43] people to fast when you want him to do
[1:41:45] this but under under the headship of the
[1:41:49] world
[1:41:50] not in place of
[1:41:54] we're not saved by works
[1:41:57] it's by grace through faith are you
[1:42:00] saved
[1:42:03] we don't earn we don't earn god's favor
[1:42:06] we don't earn his merit but when we are
[1:42:08] redeemed this is out of the message to
[1:42:10] preach when we've been redeemed we no
[1:42:13] longer want our own choice
[1:42:17] he has been our choice and that's all
[1:42:20] that matters
[1:42:21] when something comes along in our life a
[1:42:23] thing that's presented and maybe we
[1:42:26] can't see it all together we gather as a
[1:42:28] family husband is praying and saying now
[1:42:31] how is this going to affect our life
[1:42:36] it's evaluated that way we are people of
[1:42:39] the now
[1:42:44] they had an expectation
[1:42:46] brother gabriel they were confused god
[1:42:48] promised us in deuteronomy 28.
[1:42:52] i mean the crops are bad there's no do
[1:42:54] god promised this
[1:42:56] but god
[1:42:58] comes by way of his word
[1:43:00] to show them
[1:43:02] i gave my word
[1:43:03] but there's necessary conditions that
[1:43:05] must be met
[1:43:07] for that word to be
[1:43:08] fulfilled now you and i could not meet
[1:43:11] them conditions on our own
[1:43:13] god don't give it to you and i and say
[1:43:15] hey guess what the conditions are god
[1:43:18] sends his word
[1:43:20] he declares that word and he declares it
[1:43:23] not just by speaking it but by
[1:43:25] demonstrating it
[1:43:28] demonstrating he's a now god
[1:43:30] he demonstrates his word his presence as
[1:43:33] it comes down to our lives personally
[1:43:34] and then as we will yield and surrender
[1:43:36] it transforms us
[1:43:39] to do what meet the conditions
[1:43:42] for that word to be
[1:43:44] fulfilled
[1:43:46] we could go to this with abraham and
[1:43:48] sarah so forth it took god coming on the
[1:43:50] scene
[1:43:52] is that right abraham had received the
[1:43:54] message abraham was god's messenger is
[1:43:56] that right
[1:43:58] anders and the same god who spoke to
[1:44:00] abraham at the beginning
[1:44:02] that same god came there and stood in
[1:44:05] flesh
[1:44:07] and said i'm going to write it again i'm
[1:44:09] going to count in pharah's flesh i will
[1:44:12] visit her according to the time of life
[1:44:15] the same god who has veiled here now
[1:44:17] with the same god will be veiled in
[1:44:20] sarah's life
[1:44:22] what was it what does it do what what
[1:44:23] would hinder this what would hinder
[1:44:25] isaac from coming doubt in sarah's heart
[1:44:28] if thou sayest to thy mountain and don't
[1:44:30] doubt in thy heart the word came to deal
[1:44:32] with doubt
[1:44:35] was sarah not the promised one
[1:44:38] was she not the promised chosen womb
[1:44:42] are we not the chosen womb the prepared
[1:44:45] ground of god
[1:44:48] but god comes himself to deal with and
[1:44:51] bring us into the rightful condition to
[1:44:55] where doubts are dissolved and there's a
[1:44:57] same one present this morning that was
[1:45:00] there in the time of the babylonian
[1:45:02] kingdom the holy ghost is a dissolver of
[1:45:05] all doubts
[1:45:10] everything had to come back to the right
[1:45:12] order
[1:45:13] had to come back to the right order
[1:45:16] i want to say this
[1:45:18] deuteronomy 28 about the natural
[1:45:20] provision last week
[1:45:22] i think we stopped on that part
[1:45:25] where god was speaking to the people
[1:45:28] seek you first the kingdom of god and
[1:45:29] all these other things
[1:45:32] will be added to you deuteronomy 28
[1:45:35] was of their natural provision
[1:45:37] here's what god was saying
[1:45:40] god said i want you to know my benefits
[1:45:43] you know when you sit down to
[1:45:45] to go for a job you want to know what
[1:45:46] are the benefits on this job
[1:45:48] when you're getting paid this and this
[1:45:50] well he's a he's a who comes to god must
[1:45:52] believe he's a rewarder and them that
[1:45:54] diligently seek him right and there's
[1:45:56] benefits forgetting on all his benefits
[1:45:59] right
[1:46:01] but you see the benefits was god was
[1:46:03] letting them know you just put me first
[1:46:05] the focus is upon my work the focus is
[1:46:08] upon my kingdom and everything else i
[1:46:11] will ensure it doesn't hinder
[1:46:14] you
[1:46:16] i'll provide for you
[1:46:19] i'll cause your enemies to be at peace
[1:46:21] with you
[1:46:23] yo you mean god they're going to be my
[1:46:25] buddies and they say they'd be your
[1:46:26] buddies i said i'll cause them to be at
[1:46:27] peace with you
[1:46:30] how does that happen by seeking first
[1:46:33] the kingdom of god and then all these
[1:46:34] other things i'll bless you around i'll
[1:46:36] drop the dew i'll do all these other
[1:46:38] things will be added unto you
[1:46:44] so the ultimate and necessary condition
[1:46:46] is faith
[1:46:49] faith
[1:46:51] and satan's objective
[1:46:54] is always to try to come at faith
[1:46:56] remember as we look to just made those
[1:46:57] comments in the beginning on losing
[1:46:59] substance
[1:47:00] is to try to come
[1:47:02] and try to disrupt faith
[1:47:05] he can come that way
[1:47:07] with thoughts and you can entertain
[1:47:08] those thoughts
[1:47:10] listen now he can also he comes in a way
[1:47:13] there's traps
[1:47:14] set all around
[1:47:16] but the focus is not on traps
[1:47:21] you there's the devil has traps
[1:47:22] everywhere
[1:47:23] i'm not going to read all the quotes
[1:47:26] but there's traps all around and you
[1:47:28] will stumble and you do stumble but
[1:47:30] remember what a trap is it's not
[1:47:32] something with a sign on it that says
[1:47:34] hey
[1:47:36] hermano carlos there's a trap right here
[1:47:40] just come right up this way and
[1:47:43] no
[1:47:44] what is a trap i'm not a trapper
[1:47:48] i'm not trapper zachary we ain't going
[1:47:51] there
[1:47:52] you want a trap you can call brother
[1:47:53] wayne up here he'll help you
[1:47:56] but a trapper i've watched the guys i've
[1:47:58] seen the videos on what they do they got
[1:48:00] to boil the traps you got to take the
[1:48:02] scent off of them
[1:48:04] and then you've got to bring them in an
[1:48:06] area where that person walks
[1:48:09] animal walks
[1:48:12] don't read into anything
[1:48:15] you have to but you can't you know
[1:48:18] let me polish this trap up
[1:48:21] you've got to place it
[1:48:23] so as though there's no alarm
[1:48:27] to what's going on
[1:48:31] no scent
[1:48:33] nothing to give it away
[1:48:35] it's just like
[1:48:38] you know an animal i've watched them
[1:48:40] watch the deer come out watch them right
[1:48:42] around the blinder
[1:48:48] bobby you know what i'm talking about
[1:48:49] man
[1:48:51] hey brother bobby told me a long time
[1:48:52] ago first time he took me honey said you
[1:48:54] close your eyes
[1:48:56] you hunker
[1:48:57] you're just like the guy standing out
[1:48:58] playing hide and seek close your eyes
[1:49:00] hope they don't see you
[1:49:04] but a trap
[1:49:06] it's so easy
[1:49:07] to walk into it
[1:49:11] but don't be focused on traps like
[1:49:14] i don't want to make a mistake no keep
[1:49:16] your eyes on him
[1:49:18] if you keep your eyes on him
[1:49:21] he'll guide you through
[1:49:23] and you keep your eyes on him that
[1:49:26] if you
[1:49:27] fall into a trap get your eyes on him
[1:49:29] he'll see you out of that trap
[1:49:35] because we're not going to be well you
[1:49:36] know i'm going to be free from traps but
[1:49:37] neither are we saying oh well i can't
[1:49:39] look no we reckon that traps are always
[1:49:41] all around
[1:49:42] but sometimes the way traps come
[1:49:45] remember
[1:49:46] i i know i've i've experienced a lot of
[1:49:48] things seen a lot of things over the
[1:49:50] years as a pastor and coming in even to
[1:49:52] a few years before you know taking over
[1:49:54] here in the assembly i've seen traps
[1:49:57] i've seen traps come around until i just
[1:49:59] decrease it just a little bit right just
[1:50:01] a little bit
[1:50:02] i've seen them just i've seen it
[1:50:04] decrease here
[1:50:06] or seen things to where the traps would
[1:50:08] come in many different forms
[1:50:11] and one of the things that i've watched
[1:50:13] and how traps and things can come at
[1:50:15] times is when things get out of
[1:50:18] god's divine order
[1:50:21] can i read this quote in closing
[1:50:25] brother brown i'm in two places in the
[1:50:26] message he deals with what's an
[1:50:27] overcoming life
[1:50:29] and he talks about the order
[1:50:32] he says any christian
[1:50:34] will think of others
[1:50:36] before himself i'm on the second
[1:50:37] paragraph of god using his gift
[1:50:40] any christian will think of others
[1:50:41] before himself
[1:50:43] every christian
[1:50:45] tries
[1:50:46] to put god first
[1:50:48] i'm not gonna get all the way through
[1:50:49] this one
[1:50:51] hope you understand i as in looking at
[1:50:54] these things and the spirit of god just
[1:50:55] picks them up
[1:50:56] tries to put god first you know what
[1:50:58] that tells me brother brian it's a
[1:51:00] trying it's an effort it's not just a
[1:51:02] automatic
[1:51:06] it's true
[1:51:07] that when the holy ghost has come there
[1:51:09] is a holy life that's lived out
[1:51:11] automatically
[1:51:12] let me just put it to you like this
[1:51:14] there's certain doors that you can come
[1:51:16] to like right here
[1:51:17] this door is not like the supermarket
[1:51:19] door
[1:51:21] you know how the supermarket door does
[1:51:22] you can walk up to it
[1:51:23] [Music]
[1:51:26] you walk in with your hands in your
[1:51:27] pockets and then there's some doors if
[1:51:29] you do that
[1:51:32] right you can kind of get used to doors
[1:51:33] being open right
[1:51:35] and then what if it says automatic door
[1:51:37] and here you are you want yeah honey
[1:51:38] that's good pow
[1:51:42] what said it was an automatic door
[1:51:46] you see there's some things in the word
[1:51:47] of god that's just like peter it was
[1:51:50] automatic doors
[1:51:52] when it opened in the prison and then
[1:51:54] there's other things
[1:51:55] that we have to open
[1:51:58] there's things that we have to do that
[1:52:00] god will not do for us
[1:52:02] god won't god won't come to the house of
[1:52:04] god for us
[1:52:06] he won't pray for us
[1:52:08] he won't read for us he won't get into
[1:52:10] the message for us
[1:52:13] no no no no no what kind of father would
[1:52:15] he be
[1:52:17] man we'd be really spoiled wouldn't we
[1:52:22] i'm gonna read this one we just end
[1:52:24] tries to that that that tells me it's a
[1:52:27] battle
[1:52:28] and that just tells me and how many
[1:52:30] knows it's a battle
[1:52:32] it's a battle don't get down because
[1:52:34] it's a battle
[1:52:35] it is a battle
[1:52:38] let me just drop you this when god came
[1:52:41] there in the message of haggai he said
[1:52:43] the lord of hosts host means army that's
[1:52:46] gathered for war
[1:52:49] it's a battle
[1:52:51] every day is a battle every moment is a
[1:52:53] battle
[1:52:55] and you or i can get weary because of
[1:52:58] the battle but remember who your
[1:53:00] strength is
[1:53:04] your strength is the lord
[1:53:09] it's got to be a strength friends on the
[1:53:11] inside i believe i think all of us
[1:53:13] believe in here i believe in
[1:53:15] rededication of our lives
[1:53:17] i believe as we come to the house of god
[1:53:19] when the word's coming forth it ought to
[1:53:21] cause us to come to a place of
[1:53:23] examination we want to rededicate our
[1:53:25] lives when i'm listening to the message
[1:53:28] it brings me into that place
[1:53:30] sitting there the other morning in the
[1:53:32] wee hours listening to the message
[1:53:34] indictment brothers i was sitting right
[1:53:36] there at the end of the message with my
[1:53:38] hands up with the prophet god i want to
[1:53:41] fully consecrate my life
[1:53:47] hallelujah
[1:53:48] i mean you might be at work you may not
[1:53:50] be able to do that but right away you're
[1:53:51] listening to a work right there in your
[1:53:53] heart you say man lord that's me lord
[1:53:55] jesus that's me lord so be it lord god
[1:54:01] think of the words when the prophet came
[1:54:04] from beyond the curtain of time
[1:54:08] just keep
[1:54:10] pressing
[1:54:12] just keep
[1:54:14] pressing
[1:54:16] just keep
[1:54:18] pressing
[1:54:19] limb now
[1:54:21] now
[1:54:22] press on little bride press on little
[1:54:25] lily press on
[1:54:29] you look in your life and as i said we
[1:54:31] believe in
[1:54:32] rededication but friends listen
[1:54:35] throughout this congregation those are
[1:54:37] streaming those
[1:54:39] be very honest before god have you had
[1:54:41] an original dedication in your life
[1:54:46] i don't say that to be indifferent i
[1:54:47] don't say that to be mean i don't say
[1:54:49] that to say that the whole of this
[1:54:51] congregation
[1:54:52] everyone knows where they're at but it's
[1:54:54] an hour
[1:54:56] it's an hour of now
[1:54:59] has there been an original dedication in
[1:55:02] your life
[1:55:03] see rededication isn't when we come to
[1:55:06] church and then we go back in the world
[1:55:08] and oh we get cold and we go back to our
[1:55:10] own ways that's that's not rededication
[1:55:14] re-dedication is a re of what has
[1:55:18] originally taken place in a life
[1:55:22] and we need rededication
[1:55:25] but we also need
[1:55:26] an original dedication too
[1:55:32] and every time god
[1:55:33] dedicated
[1:55:35] his temple his work
[1:55:38] he dedicated it
[1:55:41] by himself
[1:55:44] by his presence coming down
[1:55:46] to where nobody
[1:55:48] could add or take away from it
[1:55:51] even the priest could not minister in
[1:55:52] the time of psalm nobody can add or take
[1:55:54] away from what god does when the fire of
[1:55:57] god comes down it not only cleanses but
[1:56:00] it sets that life on fire
[1:56:05] you see
[1:56:07] the rededication as we go through times
[1:56:10] and things in our life and we need to
[1:56:12] rededicate our lives we must rededicate
[1:56:15] our lives we have to look
[1:56:17] and really take inventory in our life to
[1:56:19] see
[1:56:20] what's going on
[1:56:24] it's kind of so it's so bringing it
[1:56:29] not real shouting well sometimes it's
[1:56:31] not real shouting but his presence is
[1:56:33] still here very sweet
[1:56:35] it's very sweet
[1:56:37] very sweet and very tender
[1:56:39] it's the same tenderness that brother
[1:56:41] graham talks about
[1:56:42] and standing in the gap when that
[1:56:43] revelation of jesus christ strikes your
[1:56:45] heart and the swin the sweetness and the
[1:56:47] tenderness
[1:56:48] of his person
[1:56:50] the love of the world is gone
[1:56:53] there's no desire for the things of the
[1:56:54] world but the desire and the love
[1:56:58] is for him and to him
[1:57:00] and you know i i can't
[1:57:02] i can stand and
[1:57:03] i can be honest with you you know
[1:57:05] there's times and things that throughout
[1:57:06] throughout the years when i've
[1:57:08] sat in that office sometimes corrections
[1:57:11] come right there in that office of
[1:57:12] things i've had to
[1:57:13] say sometimes waiting sometimes a
[1:57:15] situation that comes which that's no
[1:57:17] different that's that comes as a pastor
[1:57:19] within that certainly not things that i
[1:57:21] enjoy doing at all
[1:57:24] but even right here as we come together
[1:57:26] whether it's
[1:57:27] for the samuel standing here
[1:57:30] or we have another minister that comes
[1:57:32] in
[1:57:33] it's the holy spirit
[1:57:35] that's speaking to our lives
[1:57:42] and this is where we want to say god
[1:57:46] i want to take this home
[1:57:49] i want to take this home i
[1:57:51] want my life
[1:57:54] to be further changed
[1:57:57] i don't want to come i don't want to i
[1:57:58] don't want to leave here the same way
[1:58:00] that i came in
[1:58:03] i don't want to leave here because
[1:58:04] friends it takes a love affair
[1:58:08] down on the inside
[1:58:11] many people love god
[1:58:13] in their spirit
[1:58:15] in their mind
[1:58:18] but to love him
[1:58:20] from your soul
[1:58:23] that's the love of god
[1:58:25] that's the work of the holy spirit
[1:58:27] that's the shekinah glory that's the
[1:58:30] anchor
[1:58:31] that's the thai post that's the absolute
[1:58:34] that's the real baptism of the holy
[1:58:35] ghost
[1:58:37] and it puts us in motion
[1:58:40] for him
[1:58:43] think about that and we just stop here
[1:58:45] to today
[1:58:49] but that thought will we receive
[1:58:51] correction i
[1:58:52] i myself i want to stand
[1:58:55] i want the word to examine my life
[1:58:58] not just when i come here
[1:59:00] i want an examination when i'm in prayer
[1:59:02] and i tell you right now there's things
[1:59:04] as i was fellowshipping with my wife and
[1:59:07] just a little little time and we were
[1:59:09] fellowshipping and i told her i said you
[1:59:10] know honey i said one of the things i
[1:59:12] said that i'm so grateful for
[1:59:15] they said it may not sound like a lot i
[1:59:17] said but i can look back
[1:59:19] and i can see in when i look back in my
[1:59:22] life and i can see
[1:59:24] things and tell me when god as my walk
[1:59:27] first going with the lord certain things
[1:59:28] that you could see in your life
[1:59:30] you just be very honest pride
[1:59:34] see it's what i how i identify when god
[1:59:36] brings it out now for somebody else they
[1:59:38] pride but see there's things that god
[1:59:40] can bring certain things out
[1:59:42] in our lives
[1:59:43] so brother simon how could you be
[1:59:45] thankful because what i'm thankful for
[1:59:47] is i can see that
[1:59:49] and i can know that i need his grace
[1:59:51] right now
[1:59:53] to be able to stand within certain
[1:59:55] things and and see certain things and
[1:59:58] but to have a heart
[2:00:01] that's willing
[2:00:02] to be corrected
[2:00:05] that's what i told my wife i said i
[2:00:06] thank god
[2:00:08] that to be able to rejoice in to see my
[2:00:12] weaknesses
[2:00:15] because you know why
[2:00:17] he's my strength
[2:00:20] all that does
[2:00:21] is bring to my attention these are
[2:00:24] channels
[2:00:25] i want to flow through
[2:00:29] lord these are my weaknesses but if
[2:00:30] you'll surrender if you surrender your
[2:00:32] weaknesses
[2:00:34] to me
[2:00:36] then i'll pour my strength through your
[2:00:38] weaknesses
[2:00:41] aren't you glad for that
[2:00:44] oh my

[2:01:38] that is you fought more
[2:01:41] of them than you did of your own blood
[2:01:46] for you were willing
[2:01:48] to give
[2:01:50] your own blood
[2:01:52] to purchase
[2:01:53] our ransom
[2:01:58] now lord jesus

[2:02:36] audience
[2:02:38] i speak lord throughout this
[2:02:39] congregation

[2:02:44] and it's for every one of us
[2:02:46] no matter
[2:02:48] where we're at in our walk but i i pray
[2:02:51] god i pray
[2:02:54] may there be such
[2:02:56] a desperation that strikes
[2:02:59] in every heart
[2:03:04] to live now

[2:03:48] may it resonate lord in every heart and
[2:03:50] every life
[2:03:54] god
[2:03:55] the strongest person in here lord
[2:03:58] mentally or physically is no match
[2:04:02] for the strength of satan in this hour
[2:04:06] your prophet puts it in the message
[2:04:08] contest satan is powerful and he's
[2:04:10] getting more powerful
[2:04:13] [Music]
[2:04:17] but there's an answer for that
[2:04:21] and that answer is yourself lord
[2:04:24] that word of the living god coming on
[2:04:26] the inside
[2:04:28] where a vessel lord is
[2:04:30] emptied up lord
[2:04:33] but now to get that space filled
[2:04:40] filled with the holy ghost
[2:04:42] to be full
[2:04:43] of the spirit of the living god a
[2:04:46] surrender may be such a determination
[2:04:49] lord
[2:04:50] if things of this world lord that's
[2:04:53] wanted to come in our sisters lord our
[2:04:55] brothers lord
[2:04:57] whether clothing make up lord things of
[2:04:59] this world looking at things there
[2:05:01] shouldn't be i pray right now lord they
[2:05:03] would just rise lord god in the very
[2:05:07] pulsation of the holy spirit
[2:05:10] and go to war against that lord
[2:05:13] may they be like david and step off the
[2:05:16] hill this morning and say today

[2:05:22] granted lord
[2:05:24] may they lord come to that place lord
[2:05:27] may there be a facing a showdown lord
[2:05:30] may there be a raising of goliath's head
[2:05:32] lord in their life
[2:05:34] i pray god may it be such a press
[2:05:38] the bible speaks to us lord that the law
[2:05:40] and prophets were until john
[2:05:42] now came the fulfillment of that
[2:05:45] and in the fulfillment of it grace
[2:05:48] is displayed the word made flesh and it
[2:05:51] announces to us that every man must
[2:05:54] press
[2:05:55] press
[2:05:56] into the kingdom of god
[2:05:59] it's not something that's given we must
[2:06:02] press we must take hold we must lay hold
[2:06:06] we must take that which god you have
[2:06:08] placed before us and declare this
[2:06:11] rightfully belongs to you as my son as
[2:06:13] my daughter god i pray this morning
[2:06:16] right now if there's one show lord here
[2:06:19] or streaming lord that's never come into
[2:06:21] that original dedication

[2:06:25] care if they're old don't care they've
[2:06:27] been around this message all their life
[2:06:30] but if they've never had an original
[2:06:32] dedication in their life lord may this
[2:06:34] be a moment lord god that father not
[2:06:37] only my words lord under your
[2:06:40] inspiration that would pray this prayer
[2:06:42] lord but may their heart lord be
[2:06:45] inclined o god to the pulsation of the
[2:06:48] holy spirit to say yes lord god i want
[2:06:51] that original dedication of the baptism
[2:06:55] of the holy ghost i want that lord i
[2:06:57] must have that pillar of fire lord in my
[2:07:00] life oh god
[2:07:03] granted lord i pray
[2:07:05] oh jesus
[2:07:07] may lord god that same holy spirit move
[2:07:10] down lord into those lies
[2:07:13] may this be a moment lord that sets it
[2:07:16] in motion lord god
[2:07:21] oh granted lord jesus
[2:07:25] maybe they've waited around maybe they
[2:07:26] waited and waited they become
[2:07:28] discouraged things have come their way
[2:07:30] but here you've come to let them know
[2:07:32] like you did lord in haggai one want
[2:07:35] mercy and grace to us lord

[2:08:24] that very innocent very very very
[2:08:26] innocent

[2:09:32] in to do this
[2:09:34] and the enemy that would creep in lord
[2:09:37] to try to discourage your people
[2:09:40] and the enemy lord that would come in
[2:09:42] to try to just cause them to take a back
[2:09:44] seat
[2:09:46] to just become
[2:09:47] disheartened to become just sitting down
[2:09:50] and just kind of going along with the
