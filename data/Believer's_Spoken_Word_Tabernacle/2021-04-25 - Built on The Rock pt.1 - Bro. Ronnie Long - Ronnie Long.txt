come together and be together and um we just want to say so thankful to have brother ronnie and sister felice that the lord has made a way for them to be with us here this morning and they come to us from from bluffton from brother ray erickson's and i met brother ronnie and sister felice we met them a few years ago had some meetings we were together and just since that time just just had wonderful times of fellowship and i just really love i really love brother ronnie's spirit i love that of his family i love his stand for the word and it's his first time being here with us and we want you to feel at home we want him just to take his liberty and god'll just just come down and just take the gift and you realize that it's god coming to minister to our needs you have the control on the gift of god the man of god has studied and he's looked at things that god's put on his heart some things that you don't even have in his notes you don't even know why did i have this down why did i feel drawn this way but god had you and me in mind god's so mindful god is so mindful of every little detail he doesn't leave anything out so whatever your need is this morning know that god is mindful so we hear that but i want you to understand that god is mindful of your need this morning this service though i when i contacted brother romney some months ago to come and see if he'd be available god already knew this service would be here before the foundation of the world god knew we would still be here god knew that brother ronnie would be standing here and god know you and me would be sitting there and most importantly that he'd be right here in our midst god knew that so this is not a coincidence it's been arranged by god it says the prophet would just direct us and how god would teach him and how those things would be spoken to us to where whoever has to be sitting in that chair the glasses have to be right here this one has to be right here we don't have to try to get nobody into that place it's god in his sovereignty that orchestrates everything amen and i love that i love that that's a that's that's a real rest that we have in the lord so we just as we invite brother ronnie to come and just to take his liberty here this morning that the holy spirit would just have complete control i also want to say it's good to have sister pansy here with us and certainly our heart as over the the past weeks of sister pansy we certainly have stood with you and grieving and we just want you to know and just to express our our our deep felt sorrow and know the words continuing to hold you up in prayer amen we love you and appreciate you so glad to have sister michelle back here with us of god's mercy for our sisters of course we're glad to have brother bobby and chrissy as well but [Applause] if you haven't been here in a few weeks we're glad to have you too amen let's just let's just pull on the gift of god this morning amen i'm just i'm just really just looking forward to what god has for us amen here this morning let's just sing the song what are you playing right now jesus draw me close amen let's see let's just sing that as our brother comes oh jesus [Music] [Music] around me faded jesus [Music] do you [Applause] [Music] lord foreign christ [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] lord jesus christ [Music] [Applause] to worship [Music] amen said our prayer this morning just to draw closer to him just to be in communion with him and that sweet harmony and in his presence that only he can he can move that way and only he can speak that way and only he can touch our heart that way it's it's our desire that we could be closer to him amen good morning it's good to be in the house of the lord with you all this morning and um i've been here in service before but it's our first time here to speak and so we just really appreciate for the samuel and and asking us and the confidence and we certainly appreciate his ministry and uh just watching how how god moves and there are things that take takes place and services that that only you know you know things that are spoken that are spoken to the secrets of your heart and i know brother samuel is a gifted brother and i've watched that gift work even in my life and uh we were at some some meetings out in new mexico brother samuel was ministering and it really wasn't him it was the holy spirit and there were people in that room that i i know their lives uh they're my family i've been related to them my whole life and and just watching the lord just directly speak to situations that he'd never met them before and never talked to them before but it was just the lord speaking to those needs and i trust that the same thing could happen this morning that we could just just look to the lord to speak to our hearts this morning and amen it's good to have my wife with me this morning and we're going to try to sing a song wonderful songs if i wasn't sure on what direction to head that song service would have put me back in line but i think we're in the same channel brother amen amen will this pick me up if i just use this here yeah okay just hold that well we're not super talented so help us out amen our first time singing this one [Music] every time i try to make it on my own [Music] on there was jesus i couldn't see it then but i can see [Music] [Applause] [Music] searching [Applause] [Music] in the broken pieces [Applause] every moment where i've been and where i'm going even when i didn't [Music] [Applause] know [Applause] [Music] for this man who needs amazing kind of [Music] grace [Music] so i thank god every day there was jesus [Applause] every moment where i've been and where i'm going even when i didn't know [Music] was [Music] buried in the broken pieces even when i didn't know [Music] is even when i didn't know it what could it say [Music] [Music] jesus [Applause] praise the lord amen praise the lord this morning built on that rock amen praise the lord thou hast searched me and knew thou knowest my doubt sitting in my uprising thou understandeth my thought afar off that passes my path and my lying down and art acquainted with all my ways for there is not a word in my tongue but o lord thou knowest that all together appears thou hast to set me behind and before and lay thy hand upon me such knowledge is too wonderful for me it is high i cannot attain unto it whether shall i go from thy spirit or whither shall i flee from thy presence if i ascend up into heaven thou art there if i make my bed in hell behold thou are there if i take wings if i take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea even there shall thy hand lead me and thy right hand shall hold me if i say surely the darkness shall cover me even the night shall be light about me yea the darkness hideth not from thee but the night shineth as the day the darkness and the light are both alike to thee for thou hast possessed my reigns thou has covered me in my mother's womb i will praise thee for i am fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous are that works and that my soul knoweth right well in the uh amplified there that fearfully and wonderfully translate to to intricately my substance was not hit from thee when i was made in secret and curiously rod in the lowest parts of the earth thine eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect and in thy book all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them how precious also are thy thoughts unto me o god how great is the sum of them if i should count them they are more in number than the sand when i awake i am still with thee amen may we just bow our heads jesus we love you lord father we just lord we look for you this morning to come father we feel you here lord we lord we feel your presence among us father and the songs have been sung and praise is lifted on high father but now it's your time father lord to speak lord we just want to move ourselves out of the way lord just let us open our hearts to you father lord even you even now father in our trials and our moments father lord you can speak to each need in the building father lord you know each situation going on in each life lord and father i pray that you just lord circumcise the lips father your servant father this morning god may your word just come forth lord with power and demonstration lord as jews orchestrated it before the foundation of the world father lord there are trials that walked in this door father but there's a there's an answer dwelling already in the building father lord we just look to you as the author and the finisher this morning god we pray in your name jesus christ amen you may be seated amen brother samuel already set me up he just kind of took my intro there but we weren't here by chance we're not here just because there's nowhere else to be but god has already ordained this i mean down to the color of the shirt and the color of the tie and yes and uh and even even through through you know we never would have thought you know a couple years ago we'd be sitting in a brother shane god bless you with the masks on you know we never would have thought that a couple years ago but here we are but god saw it's not a surprise to god and he saw us here in this situation and in this time and everything is perfectly in place but it's all according to god's plan and it's a setup all right come on now it's just a big setup and we think we're just walking through this life and we're just going ahead with the without we're just pushing through with our troubles and our styles but but i just want to tell the devil something this morning it's a setup you maybe walked in here thinking you had the upper hand on somebody but it was all a setup from the time that you started with that cancer and the time that you started with that depression it was just a setup for a moment in time where you could be defeated where where that devil would be defeated where that devil would be put in its place it was all just a setup according to the timing of god and i believe we're walking in perfect time with god's word there's nothing out of place and nothing out of cater nothing out of step for his words perfect amen and everything he does is perfect and there's a season and a time for everything there's a time for a cleansing but there's also a time for action i believe we're we're in a in a time and in an age where we are doing things that nobody else has ever been required to do before much like mary where where she was to bring forth a promised word when there had been women of old age bring forth and sarah had been had brought forth and hannah had brought forth but mary was required to do something that nobody else had ever done and it was bring forth the promised word i believe that's us this morning we are going to manifest the promised word of this hour and we're not just here with with our own inabilities by chance but god has intricately made us that way he crafted us that way with our with our inconsistencies and our own failures and our own faults but yet he made us that way so his strength could be made perfect through our weaknesses amen and i believe that we all have one thing in common and that's we're all too weak to get it done but god who is rich in mercy have placed within us that overcoming power and it's already laying within the church the prophet of god said that that everything that we have need of your healing you're rapturing faith your overcoming power is already laying within you yeah i think my if we could just realize what is already what we already possess abraham was told you're the possessor of all things it was already in abraham he just needed the revelation to know he's talking about me brother he's talking about me if you can just put your name in that scripture he's talking about i am the possessor of all things just think about an infinite god with infinite capabilities he can create a molecule he can create a speck he can create whatever he wants the earth we're standing on the air we're breathing and yet maybe he missed it with you no i don't think so not not my god but he made you exactly the way you are to fulfill an exact purpose in this hour and there's nobody nobody that can take your place you might think that your neighbor might be more qualified or your pastor might be more qualified but there's nobody that can fill your shoes there's nobody that can have your testimony and god is just looking for a surrendered somebody to make his will come forth he just needs a body that will say here am i send me lord i'm not worthy woe is me i'm a man of unclean lips i don't deserve it i didn't i didn't earn it but here in my lord let me be a living epistle written in red of all men filled with the holy ghost and power living this word to make it manifest in this hour he made each of us perfectly just perfectly we look at ourselves in the mirror and my goodness isn't there things we would change if it were up to us oh man then we start we get into our personalities oh man but god didn't make him
