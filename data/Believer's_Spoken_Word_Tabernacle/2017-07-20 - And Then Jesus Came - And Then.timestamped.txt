[35:50] Christ and giving all the glory to God
[35:53] amen
[35:56] amen
[35:58] I want to read from Matthew
[36:03] chapter 8 verses 14 and 15.
[36:28] and when Jesus was coming to Peter's
[36:31] house
[36:32] he saw his wife's mother laid and sick
[36:35] of fever
[36:37] he touched her hand and the fever left
[36:39] her and she arose and ministered unto
[36:42] them
[36:42] may be seated
[36:44] what I'd like to speak on tonight is
[36:46] then Jesus came
[36:49] then Jesus came
[36:53] here
[36:56] late
[36:58] Peter's mother-in-law
[37:00] sick with a fever there was nothing
[37:02] anybody could do for her
[37:04] there was no nothing that uh
[37:09] could break that fever
[37:12] and Jesus came
[37:16] and he didn't
[37:18] put on any big boisterous front or
[37:21] anything like that
[37:23] he just reached out the Bible said he
[37:25] just reached out and touched her hand
[37:29] that's all we need tonight is a touch
[37:31] from him
[37:33] amen we need a touch from him
[37:36] I think of
[37:38] blind Bartimaeus
[37:40] he was sitting along the roadside he was
[37:43] begging
[37:44] he was blind he couldn't see
[37:48] where the random said he was
[37:51] old
[37:54] blind miserable shivering cold and needy
[37:59] said he was an outcast to the public he
[38:01] was Outcast socially
[38:05] but then Jesus came along
[38:08] and when Jesus came along
[38:10] he received his sight
[38:12] remember he was crying thou son of David
[38:15] have mercy on me
[38:18] and they tried to they tried to quiet
[38:20] him trying to get him to to quit yelling
[38:24] like that but the more they tried to
[38:26] quiet him the louder he yelled
[38:30] thou son of David have mercy on me
[38:34] thou son of David have mercy on me thy
[38:37] son of David had mercy on me he was
[38:40] determined
[38:42] to be heard
[38:45] and Jesus heard him
[38:47] said bring him here
[38:49] they said come the master you come
[38:53] he said what what should I do for he
[38:55] said that I might receive my sight
[39:03] thank you
[39:04] Jesus said thy faith have made thee
[39:07] whole
[39:09] and he received his sight
[39:14] I think about
[39:16] John Ryan
[39:20] blind man and brother branham's time
[39:26] he came and was prayed for
[39:29] brother random said you're healed and he
[39:31] went
[39:32] forth from there
[39:34] and he still couldn't see
[39:38] but he went around
[39:40] got back in the line brother Brown said
[39:43] you're already healed
[39:44] then he said he caught something
[39:47] he was from a Catholic background he
[39:50] felt there was something he had to do so
[39:52] brother Ram says you go confessing by
[39:55] his stripes I'm Healed
[39:57] and so John Ryan went forth
[40:00] and every it said he he sold papers on
[40:03] the corner and he would say extra extra
[40:05] you Read All About It by his stripes I'm
[40:08] Healed
[40:10] yeah
[40:11] and everywhere he went he would tell the
[40:13] people buy his stripes I'm Healed
[40:16] you know the story that one day he went
[40:18] into the barbershop
[40:20] he was in there and the barber was
[40:22] cutting his hair and the barber began to
[40:24] make a little bit of fun and said I
[40:26] thought you got prayed for he said yes I
[40:28] did
[40:29] he said but you still can't see
[40:32] Don Ryan said by his stripes I'm Healed
[40:38] and he jumped up out of that chair
[40:40] because his eyesighted came what
[40:43] happened there
[40:44] brother random talks about how that he
[40:47] had prayed for people and then they were
[40:49] waiting on their healing and he talks
[40:52] about two women they were waiting for
[40:54] their healing and they lived up in the
[40:57] same area the same place
[40:59] and said they just kept confessing that
[41:02] they were healed
[41:04] brother Brown said what were they
[41:06] waiting on they were waiting on the
[41:07] angel of the Lord to come
[41:09] and fulfill the word of God
[41:13] John Ryan was waiting on Jesus to come
[41:16] he had already been healed
[41:19] but then Jesus visited him that day when
[41:22] he was sitting in the barber chair and
[41:23] out the door he ran
[41:25] he said the barber was running after him
[41:28] there was The Barbers Abram just some
[41:29] flapping on John Ryan him running down
[41:31] the street saying I can see I can see I
[41:34] can see
[41:36] [Applause]
[41:41] I often think in the Bible about the man
[41:44] who lived in the tombs
[41:47] how he was
[41:50] possessed by devils
[41:54] so many Devils that they called
[41:56] themselves Legion
[41:58] the Bible never ever even tells the
[42:01] man's actual name
[42:03] because the spirits the demons had so
[42:06] much control over him that even when he
[42:09] got to Jesus he couldn't speak of
[42:11] himself
[42:13] the demons were in such control
[42:16] they would bind him with chains and he
[42:19] would break the chains asunder
[42:21] they would uh
[42:24] uh try to restrain him and no matter how
[42:27] many men it was they couldn't restrain
[42:29] him
[42:32] physically Jesus couldn't have
[42:35] restrained him either
[42:41] but there was more
[42:43] than just a man that came
[42:46] this was Jesus a son of God
[42:50] and when he came
[42:52] I believed there was something
[42:54] a part of this man that that even though
[42:59] he was possessed by so many Devils there
[43:03] was the part of him in there that wanted
[43:05] to be free
[43:09] and I believe that's what brought him to
[43:12] the feet of Jesus when Jesus came and
[43:14] landed on the shore there
[43:20] and the devils
[43:23] said why have you come to torment us
[43:26] they beseeched him not to torment him
[43:30] but Jesus said because Jesus said come
[43:33] out of him
[43:36] and remember they asked Jesus could they
[43:37] go could he cast could they go into the
[43:39] swine
[43:42] history says that
[43:44] that Guardia there where this man was
[43:48] that they their economy was largely
[43:51] based on raising pigs
[43:55] and when these Devils went into this
[43:58] wine why they ran them right off into
[44:01] the lake
[44:02] and they all choked the Bible said
[44:09] Jesus came and done
[44:11] and delivered this man
[44:16] and he caused him
[44:18] to have such a joy he wanted to follow
[44:20] Jesus
[44:23] but the other people that lived around
[44:25] there they had caused them fear when he
[44:28] came
[44:32] and they wanted him to depart from their
[44:35] coasts
[44:40] Jesus laughed
[44:44] but he told the man to stay and go tell
[44:47] everyone what had happened to me
[44:50] can you imagine him going back to his
[44:53] home the way Jesus instructed him and
[44:55] telling everyone
[44:56] look I'm free
[44:58] the people the Bible says the people
[45:01] could see that the man was there in his
[45:04] right mind
[45:05] yeah
[45:08] but
[45:10] they were fearful
[45:12] and he had destroyed their economy
[45:19] and so they didn't want him there
[45:27] they had
[45:29] he wouldn't fit within their Church
[45:31] order
[45:37] they didn't want the move of the spirit
[45:40] of God in their midst
[45:45] Jesus won't stay wherever he's not
[45:48] wanted
[45:52] churches say they want him
[45:54] but there's those that bind the service
[45:58] up and the people up so much the Holy
[46:01] Spirit couldn't even move among them
[46:07] but to those
[46:08] who want his presence to those who long
[46:12] for the move of the spirit
[46:14] and Jesus comes
[46:16] and he moves among us
[46:18] [Applause]
[46:30] in the mighty conqueror brother Branham
[46:32] said
[46:34] when he was here I see a picture of
[46:36] demons as a possessed a young man
[46:39] and all the military force and might and
[46:41] the law
[46:43] could do was to bind him in Chains and
[46:45] he was so strong with this demon power
[46:47] on him he could break the chains of
[46:49] slender
[46:50] there was no way to conquer him
[46:52] the evil spirits had drove him from
[46:54] among Mankind and he made his home out
[46:57] in the tombs
[46:59] and whosoever passed by this way he
[47:02] conquered them
[47:03] all but one day there was a little man
[47:06] down the road the Bible said there was
[47:08] no beauty that we would should desire
[47:10] him maybe a little stoop shouldered man
[47:13] with hair hanging down around his neck
[47:17] and this demon thought here's the time
[47:19] I'll overcome that little fella
[47:21] and they possessed that man and out in
[47:23] the road they went to meet him and when
[47:26] they run to conquer him when he raised
[47:29] his eyes they changed their tune
[47:33] foreign
[47:34] instead of trying to conquer him they
[47:36] said thou Holy One Of God why do you
[47:38] come to torment us before time
[47:40] they know they had met their match the
[47:44] Great Mighty conqueror of heaven was
[47:46] standing present
[47:49] he wasn't physically big enough to break
[47:51] the chains he was not physically able to
[47:54] hold a man who the demons had possessed
[47:57] but in him was the power of almighty God
[48:01] who the demons has to bow to and he
[48:06] conquered this enemy that Adams Race
[48:08] Hereafter who are bound with such a
[48:11] spirit has the privilege of taking the
[48:13] name of this Great Mighty conqueror and
[48:16] calling him out
[48:22] y'all have seen
[48:24] my son-in-law Brother David Horner come
[48:27] and visit among you and sing and testify
[48:32] but I recall a day
[48:34] when he came to the church
[48:37] and he was sitting on the back row
[48:39] and he was so full of devils
[48:42] foreign
[48:47] and as I was preaching that day it
[48:51] seemed like the Holy Spirit just kept
[48:53] pulling me back and directing me to him
[48:55] to finally I think everybody in a place
[48:58] realized he's not preaching to anybody
[49:00] but David
[49:03] and so I just quit looking at everybody
[49:05] else I just looked straight at David and
[49:07] preach the rest of the message
[49:14] and then the Holy Spirit came down
[49:17] anointed me and spoke through me and
[49:19] said
[49:20] you know nobody ever loved you like
[49:22] Jerry did
[49:28] and then I said I didn't say that to
[49:30] embarrass you he says oh brother Jerry
[49:32] you didn't embarrass me
[49:35] and then he came up the aisle
[49:40] but he came up I went down he said he
[49:43] wanted to be free
[49:46] I began to pray for him
[49:49] and the spirit moved and began to call
[49:51] those Devils out by what they were
[49:54] and then it came down to the one who was
[49:57] the chief devil among them
[50:00] it is tried to pull him from my grasp
[50:05] and
[50:06] I just grabbed tighter on him you know
[50:09] how you would do it just pulled him in
[50:11] tighter where he couldn't get away
[50:17] and I said you have no power
[50:20] to come out of him
[50:22] and he began to make a noise like he was
[50:24] throwing up
[50:25] and he kept making this noise
[50:29] and out it came
[50:31] and he was free
[50:35] and you've seen you've seen the witness
[50:38] of it when he's come here to visit you
[50:40] he's a different man now he's filled
[50:43] with his Spirit but it's God's spirit
[50:46] Hallelujah
[50:49] he was bound but then Jesus came and
[50:53] said the captain free
[50:55] [Music]
[51:04] oh
[51:06] I think of another person who was bound
[51:09] by devils
[51:11] the Bible said she was bound by Seven
[51:14] Devils
[51:16] her name was Mary Magdalene
[51:23] and the Bible said she was healed of the
[51:26] evil spirits
[51:30] set free
[51:35] think about it
[51:38] there she was living the kind of life
[51:40] she was living and being being
[51:42] influenced by these Seven Devils to live
[51:45] the way she was living
[51:48] the 10 she was set free one day
[51:52] and all she knows from then on was to
[51:54] follow Jesus
[52:01] one time
[52:03] there was a woman
[52:05] in the Bible that had a blood issue
[52:08] and
[52:10] the Bible says for 12 years
[52:15] for 12 years she had this Blood issue
[52:24] you imagine her
[52:27] 12 years
[52:29] how weak
[52:31] she would be
[52:40] but then Jesus came
[52:44] and she reached out and touched the Hem
[52:46] of His Garment
[52:50] and he said who touched me
[52:53] this I was told there's so many people
[52:55] around why would you say who touched you
[52:57] you're brushing up against so many
[52:59] people
[53:00] he said no I first I see virtue I feel
[53:05] virtue that has gone from me
[53:11] then when the woman the Bible said
[53:13] scenes she couldn't hide
[53:16] she came forward trembling and said it
[53:18] was me
[53:20] and Jesus said thy faith has made thee
[53:23] whole
[53:26] but the Bible said as soon as she
[53:28] touched the Hem of His Garment the blood
[53:30] flow was fast
[53:34] it stopped
[53:41] we were
[53:43] my family was going through
[53:45] dark time
[53:48] one of the children we had adopted about
[53:51] 16 at the time
[53:55] and
[53:56] he was just bringing a lot of stress on
[53:59] us
[54:01] take off and stay out till 3 A.M in the
[54:04] morning sneak out the house wouldn't
[54:06] come back
[54:10] wouldn't do any wouldn't do anything we
[54:13] told him
[54:18] and it was far worse than what I can
[54:20] describe to you here the things that was
[54:22] going on
[54:25] and it brought such a stress on my wife
[54:30] till her blood issue wouldn't stop
[54:36] she went to doctors
[54:38] and they were trying to figure out what
[54:40] was wrong with her
[54:43] and the doctors couldn't find what it
[54:45] was
[54:52] and she would get weak
[54:55] when we would go walking she could walk
[54:57] a little bit and then she'd have to stop
[54:59] and rest she said I'm weak my heart's
[55:01] just pounding
[55:07] you imagine losing so much blood the
[55:10] word they have to give you iron and give
[55:13] you blood transfusions and and so on
[55:18] and it just wouldn't stop and they
[55:20] couldn't figure out none of the doctors
[55:22] figure out what it was
[55:25] within one day
[55:27] a door opened up
[55:30] for this young boy to go back and live
[55:34] with his birth mother
[55:36] and when he left the blood issue stopped
[55:41] now it wasn't just him leaving it's
[55:44] because Jesus came on the scene he was
[55:47] the one that directed all that it was
[55:49] because Jesus brought all this about
[55:52] and it stopped it
[55:54] when we went through that I thought more
[55:56] and more about that woman in the Bible
[55:59] and what she must have been going
[56:01] through what she felt being so many
[56:03] years
[56:06] the doctors brother random said she went
[56:09] to doctors and positions couldn't figure
[56:11] it out
[56:13] but then Jesus came
[56:17] Hallelujah
[56:19] I tell you friends I don't know what I
[56:21] do my life if Jesus didn't come
[56:30] brother random said when Jesus received
[56:33] the Holy Ghost the devil took him out
[56:35] into the Wilderness 40 days to tempt him
[56:39] he says it in the message Victory Day
[56:43] preached in
[56:45] 60 1963
[56:47] April the 21st 1963 Victory Day
[56:53] and he said but then the word came
[56:58] and said get me behind me Satan
[57:02] see Satan was there quoting the word
[57:05] wouldn't cast herself down off this
[57:07] Pinnacle for the Dozen the word say that
[57:10] he's given his angels charge over you
[57:12] lest you dash your foot against the
[57:13] stone
[57:15] but then the word spoke
[57:19] thou shall not tempt the Lord thy God
[57:25] brother random said
[57:30] it was v-day
[57:34] it was vide Victory Day
[57:38] he said
[57:41] he comes to every v-day
[57:48] anytime we have a victory in our life
[57:50] it's because Jesus came by
[57:55] [Applause]
[58:04] the Bible talks about a man who came to
[58:06] Jesus was bidding Jesus to come to his
[58:09] home because his daughter lays sick
[58:12] while he was bitten Jesus to come that's
[58:14] when the woman touched the hymn of Jesus
[58:17] garment
[58:20] and then
[58:21] after Jesus spoke to the woman then a
[58:24] servant from the man came and said don't
[58:26] trouble the master anymore your
[58:29] daughter's dead
[58:31] and Jesus said
[58:33] only believe
[58:37] only believe
[58:41] and he went to the house and they were
[58:43] well in the morning and and crying
[58:48] and he said she's not dead she sleeps
[58:50] remember the Bible said they laughed him
[58:53] to scorn
[58:58] he just put him out
[59:04] reminds me of brother when I'm saying
[59:07] that
[59:08] about him and brother Neville going
[59:10] trying to pull different people in he
[59:12] says we're pulling them in and God's
[59:14] kicking them out
[59:19] he ran out all the unbelievers he'll
[59:21] always run out all the unbelievers
[59:31] you don't have to worry about them they
[59:32] won't stay in your midst very long
[59:38] then he took her by the hand
[59:41] and said daughter arise
[59:44] she rose up and he said give her some
[59:47] meat to eat
[59:51] Hallelujah
[59:54] she there she laid but brother I've said
[59:57] then Jesus came
[1:00:08] there was a leper
[1:00:12] the Bible talks about
[1:00:23] they came to Jesus kneeling down and
[1:00:25] said if thou will make me clean
[1:00:30] Jesus put forth his hand and touched him
[1:00:39] Jesus said I will be thou clean
[1:00:43] and immediately he was cleansed of his
[1:00:46] leprosy
[1:00:52] in Mark the seventh chapter it talks
[1:00:55] about a young man
[1:00:57] young boy
[1:00:58] was deaf and dumb it was deaf couldn't
[1:01:01] hear and he couldn't speak
[1:01:05] and they brought him before Jesus the
[1:01:07] Bible says Jesus Took and stuck his
[1:01:10] fingers in the boy's ears
[1:01:12] and then spit on his hand and and struck
[1:01:15] it onto the boy's tongue
[1:01:19] and the boy was healed
[1:01:24] then Jesus came
[1:01:27] he couldn't
[1:01:28] hear
[1:01:30] he couldn't speak but then Jesus came
[1:01:34] and it changed his life
[1:01:44] Jesus charged them
[1:01:46] don't go away go straight away don't
[1:01:48] tell anyone but the scripture said the
[1:01:51] more he charged them the more they told
[1:01:53] him till they noised it abroad
[1:01:57] that he could even heal the death and
[1:02:00] the dumb
[1:02:10] possessing the gates of the enemy
[1:02:11] brother Brenham says
[1:02:13] the Royal Sea was born
[1:02:16] he was tempted in every manner like we
[1:02:19] are just as you have to be tempted so
[1:02:23] was he
[1:02:26] the devil quickly taken him when he
[1:02:28] received the Holy Ghost Into the
[1:02:30] Wilderness for 40 days and nights to be
[1:02:33] tempted and when he come out
[1:02:36] and at his death they drove Nails in his
[1:02:38] hands and spit in his face
[1:02:41] and he went through every sickness
[1:02:44] but when he was here on Earth he proved
[1:02:46] he could conquer sickness
[1:02:49] when Peter's wife mother lay sick of
[1:02:51] Halsey he touched her hand and the fever
[1:02:53] left her
[1:02:54] when the leper cried at the gate unclean
[1:02:57] unclean if you will you can make me call
[1:03:00] he said I will be thy whole he conquered
[1:03:04] and took the Gate of leprosy he took the
[1:03:06] Gate of fevers he made every every
[1:03:10] nature obey him he was the Seed of
[1:03:13] Abraham the Royal seed the one promised
[1:03:16] was given to
[1:03:18] through him Abraham all the seed that
[1:03:23] followed him up to the Royal seed and
[1:03:25] all the seed after him God promised is
[1:03:29] true he conquered sickness he conquered
[1:03:32] Temptation when the enemy spit in his
[1:03:34] face and smote his Jaws he turned the
[1:03:37] other side
[1:03:38] when they jerked his beard in his face
[1:03:40] and spit on him he never riled back he
[1:03:42] conquered a gate of Temptation and took
[1:03:45] it
[1:03:45] then you say my temper wouldn't let me
[1:03:48] do it you Seed of Abraham yes sir he
[1:03:53] conquered it for you
[1:03:55] when he was riled up he riled not back
[1:03:58] when he was made fun of he held his
[1:04:00] peace when he was called the devil he
[1:04:03] held his peace
[1:04:05] he had one business and that was the
[1:04:07] father's business and he went about
[1:04:09] doing that
[1:04:11] and then finally they took him to a
[1:04:13] cross
[1:04:14] death had to face him all the rest of
[1:04:17] them had conquered Seas they had
[1:04:19] conquered nature they had conquered
[1:04:21] Lions they had conquered fire they had
[1:04:23] conquered everything but death
[1:04:26] but here was one beating in his brain
[1:04:29] his veins and they had
[1:04:32] he had the Conquering power of death
[1:04:36] so they took his hands and stretched him
[1:04:38] out and nailed him to a cross they beat
[1:04:40] him they striped him till his bones
[1:04:42] stared at him but when he did
[1:04:47] and they'll they done it all that they
[1:04:50] could do
[1:04:51] that struck him so now I'll take you
[1:04:55] like I did Joshua I'll take you like I
[1:04:58] did Daniel
[1:05:00] I'll do all this because I'll make you
[1:05:03] die
[1:05:05] and he died to the son got ashamed of
[1:05:08] itself
[1:05:09] he died until nature got ashamed and
[1:05:12] failed to operate the sun went down in
[1:05:15] the middle of the day the Stars wouldn't
[1:05:17] come out he died until the elements were
[1:05:20] so black you couldn't see the hand
[1:05:22] before you in the middle of the day
[1:05:24] I imagine nature said let me die with
[1:05:26] him
[1:05:28] brother
[1:05:29] when that devil sent his precious Soul
[1:05:32] into the bottomless pit of Hell
[1:05:36] there the gates opened
[1:05:40] imagine hell
[1:05:46] there was a place and the Bible calls it
[1:05:49] in the Old Testament A Place Called
[1:05:50] Paradise
[1:05:52] but it was a prison
[1:05:55] where all those that died under the
[1:05:57] blood of bulls and goats were held
[1:06:00] captive
[1:06:03] but then Jesus came
[1:06:06] into the pits of Hell Jesus came
[1:06:10] and he set the captives free
[1:06:14] on the third day when he arose they
[1:06:17] arose with him
[1:06:21] Hallelujah hell had no power over him
[1:06:26] remember in the scripture in Revelations
[1:06:28] he said stood there and he said I have
[1:06:30] the keys of death and of hell
[1:06:36] Hallelujah
[1:06:37] he conquered death hell in the grave
[1:06:52] message of what thinking of Christ
[1:06:55] he said
[1:06:57] if I should ask little Georgie Carter
[1:07:00] laying Yonder what thinking of Christ
[1:07:03] laying there nine years and eight months
[1:07:05] without even a stick of Hope
[1:07:08] then Jesus came along and made her
[1:07:10] perfectly well

[1:27:25] how many knows that when Jesus comes the
[1:27:28] situation don't stay
[1:27:30] as it was
[1:27:32] it don't stay the same
[1:27:34] you know when you look in every
[1:27:37] situation how that the Lord was leading
[1:27:39] tonight God was declaring
[1:27:42] sovereignty
[1:27:44] it wasn't any of those that was within
[1:27:48] the scripture
[1:27:49] that was Worthy of him to come by their
[1:27:53] way
[1:27:54] their need their situation was beyond
[1:27:57] any hope
[1:27:58] I would say here tonight that even if
[1:28:01] you feel like you have your situation
[1:28:04] under control that's a sign it's out of
[1:28:07] control
[1:28:09] there is no control outside of the Holy
[1:28:13] Spirit
[1:28:14] there is no control outside of the Lord
[1:28:17] there is no Deliverance outside of him
[1:28:20] no healing outside
[1:28:22] [Music]
[1:28:25] I think of when here today has been
[1:28:27] resonating in my heart in the past the
[1:28:29] past two days
[1:28:31] the scripture that brother Jerry
[1:28:33] referred to it here tonight
[1:28:35] and I've been thinking about I couldn't
[1:28:36] get away from it tonight the whole time
[1:28:38] today this could get away
[1:28:40] was with jairus's daughter
[1:28:42] [Music]
[1:28:44] you know when he made an effort
[1:28:47] to get to where Jesus was
[1:28:50] because he heard about Jesus he knew
[1:28:54] that's the only hope
[1:28:56] but in the midst of him calling
[1:29:00] the Bible says there was one who came to
[1:29:02] him
[1:29:03] and told him he said that daughters dead
[1:29:06] why trouble us thou the master any
[1:29:09] further
[1:29:10] I'm going to tell you your need is not
[1:29:13] any trouble to the master
[1:29:15] your situation is not any trouble to him
[1:29:18] as a matter of fact your need your
[1:29:20] situation what you have need of is what
[1:29:23] has made his reputation
[1:29:28] is healer he's a deliverer he's a savior
[1:29:31] Redeemer he's a god he's a shepherd your
[1:29:35] need is what allows him to make himself
[1:29:37] known to you
[1:29:40] who he is
[1:29:42] so anything that any thought that comes
[1:29:44] around I
[1:29:46] prayer before why trouble is not reject
[1:29:49] that thought
[1:29:51] and take the words of the Lord Jesus
[1:29:54] that he spoke to Jairus and he spoke to
[1:29:56] him be Not Afraid only believe
[1:30:01] fear will paralyze it'll keep you
[1:30:03] but faith from the word of God tonight
[1:30:06] that has went forth it directs you to
[1:30:09] that overriding
[1:30:12] gracious
[1:30:13] goodness of the Lord Jesus Christ and no
[1:30:16] matter your situation
