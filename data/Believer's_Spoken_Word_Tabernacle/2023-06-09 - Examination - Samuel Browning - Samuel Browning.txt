good to be in the house of the Lord and good to be gathered together amen this evening and certainly thankful to the Lord for his Mercy that while we were gone and I know you had some wonderful Services here and that's God amen God is is God and we're so thankful for that amen and we just are so grateful for his God's faithfulness you know and that's something that we so appreciate and we just miss you and I know it has only gone for a week here but uh still we missed you very much and uh a beautiful place we're at in in Arizona and uh to me is probably the second most beautiful place to this where we're at in Ohio now I know some people like other certain places but to me I I second time being there and my I just love the mountains that are not Hills they're actually mountains and I just love or kind of love the the temperatures and things and most importantly you know there's places sometimes you go there places but God's people are there and that's what makes the place and then there's sometimes when you go there's nice places and God's people are there and so this is one of those places that I can say that it's a nice place and there was God God's people are there and certainly a lot of things that are there a lot of struggles a lot of you know uphill battles and things that they themselves have to face but I certainly want to say to you I appreciate your prayers for the service as we we pretty much hit the ground running and by God's grace we were able to get our flights in last night and got in late about one in the morning and some things you know from all of this smoke from you know the Canadians don't know how to use matches yet and uh so we we told sister Sue we're going to take some uh we're going to keep sending Smokey the Bear you know things to him you know but uh you know and but regardless of all things I'm just thankful we're thankful to be back home and and uh thankful for your prayers the Lord just did marvelous things there in the in the services from the uh opening night there even until the closing so different reports are still coming in and we just it you you are part of it you may not have been there physically but you were a part of it with your prayers and so I want you just to know that even brother Dale and the congregations there asked me to bring greetings back to you here and so uh we want to go into the word of the Lord and just have a thought in our heart thank you musicians and God bless you amen if we could let's just stand and we want to I want to go right into the word of the Lord and just to read in job 23. we we begin looking at this a little bit the last time we were together and I want to just look over many scriptures brother Branham will take this chapter and this chapter is referred to uh quite a bit in the message I have heard but now I see and a lot of the same principles that you will see you know principles are things that are based upon and how things operate sometimes we're just you know sometimes we're just thankful that things are operating but God also wants us to know as Believers the principles that cause things to operate uh brother in the middle of the message how many of you listen the message humble thyself in 63. very short message and in the middle that message uh it's it's a a message that they have brother Vale come up and speak for a few moments and brother Vale takes a thought I and brother Branham comes and capitalizes on it right after that in the second part of that message and he takes uh Mark 16 and he takes the scripture and he says what makes it work and why it doesn't work and those are the things that when we look at principles in God's word I mean you and I many times we look at things and I when I've when on my computer when I press power I want it just to work I want to be able to search and get my documents going and studying I just want it to work on my phone I just want it to work but sometimes there's things that we have to go in the background of it and God wants us to understand the principles of it because there's other times that things arise and we become frustrated why isn't this working and so God's desire because the Sons and Daughters of God we are built with an authority to know our position so we just want to read here for a few moments in job 23 and verse 1. then job answered and said even today is my complaint bitter my stroke is heavier than my groaning so job is still under the burden all that I knew where I might find him that I might come even to his seat I would order my calls before him and fill my mouth with arguments now job was not saying that he was going to be arguing with God but job knew where he was standing and job knew that when he would stand before God there was not a hesitation job would be able to say Lord I've done everything that you have asked me to do I think that's powerful that's very powerful that's how the Ram came into existence on Mount Moriah I've done everything that you've asked me to do that's the key of the rapture and that is something that it's not my efforts doing it as far as because I could do things simply because I knew it was the right thing to do but for the bride it's more than just doing something because it's the right thing in my heart says Lord I want to please you see that's when it's genuine and that's where there's Peace So notice he says I would know the words which he would answer me and understand what he would say unto me will he plead against me with his great power no but he would put strength in me and there the righteous might dispute with him so should I be delivered forever from my judge behold I go forward but he's not there and backward but I cannot perceive him on the left hand where he does work but I cannot be holding he hideth himself on the right hand that I cannot see him but he know it the way that I take and when he hath tried me I shall come forth as gold brother Brian just just a Teensy bit knock it down right here just a Teensy sorry but he know it the way that I take it I want to just draw emphasis on that how could job know the way unless God had revealed the way you ever been in a situation where you you guessing at something and you don't know is this right is this how something's to be done that's not either you can't be certain you're waiting at the end to see is this right is that right that's where faith comes in faith is a revealing of God's way faith is a certainty that I know what God has said I've there is already an assurance in my heart he knows the way that I take because he's revealed the way to me the way that I'm walking he's revealed it I couldn't have found it without him so job is expressing of the grace that's come to him when he had tried me I shall come forth as gold my foot hath held his steps his way have I kept and not declined neither have I gone back from the Commandment of his lips I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food Heavenly Father tonight as we just come to you Lord in these moments that you have given to us we ask that you would come Lord and speak to our hearts in a very personal way tonight Lord those that are gathered those that Lord would stream this Lord those that would archive it I pray that God that your word it will find its Mark Lord and may our lives and our hearts God be strengthened and encouraged and enriched by your presence Lord your visitation Lord in our lives we give ourselves to you now in the name of Jesus Christ amen God bless you as you're being seated here for a few moments I want to just read to you a a quote out of the message be certain of God and brother Branham would speak this uh multiple times but I want to just draw from here a point that we want to look at tonight and he's praying and he says Lord bless Thy word as it goes forth and may the Holy Spirit capture our minds and our thoughts and prepare us for his visitation as we have asked him to come I would say God grant that you're tonight we can have a lot on our minds a lot of thoughts but God may you come and capture our minds and and our thoughts for we do not come to the house of the Lord to be seen or to see but to learn of thee and to Know Thy nature and thy way and thy causes that we might be able to face the problems of life with a real Assurance being certain of God and I want to speak tonight simple thought on a word examination and we look upon here in the word and we can see that there is a certainty that job already through all of these chapters and it doesn't diminish whatsoever of where that his faith is in God job does not know what is happening he doesn't know what's going on God has not let him know this and as a matter of fact God is silent in a moment through all of this now the course of time that this is over I I don't have that right here before me to be able to reference how many moments days weeks and time was this then all of this was taking place the duration of it but in the midst of it all there was a faith that was solid upon what God had said and this is the thing that we want to look at here tonight is is Faith itself and we so often hear we've from this Pulpit from many pulpits from throughout the scriptures the trial of our faith and we want to ensure that our lives and our hearts are in the position that faith can then operate because God's desire is that we know exactly at all times where we are standing in him the scripture would say in Hebrews 11 1 faith is the substance of things hoped for of what's expected and it's the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report and it goes on to say through faith we understand it doesn't say that we explain but we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear we are not believing that what we believe tonight because we can't explain it there are many uh solid profound agnostics that can stand in the face and can debate so clearly upon the scriptures and yet are not able to take all of God's word and you might say well they would say that the word of God is infallible it is one thing to say that the word in print is infallible but then when that word is become flesh to denounce it is then to take away from this word that we claim to believe and yet we really don't believe it so to believe the word is not only to believe the written word but it's to believe the manifested word of God for when God's word is being manifest no man can do that in himself it must be God come and the inspiration of his spirit that actually manifests the word and bring it to pass that's how we see God that's how we know God that's how we know his will his desires for our life is when he comes and begins to reveal his word and speak to our hearts in a very personal way through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear you ever had situations in your life you knew it's going to happen but you couldn't explain how or when it's just something where there's been a healing maybe it's a loved one a son or daughter and there's just something it's just drunk I can't explain it but I know it's on the way I know it's on the way that is faith faith is not what we can explain faith is the substance of things that we are looking for and expecting and then there's an Evidence it's not just something that's unseen but Faith declares itself even through our actions through our lives that I'm expecting this without faith it's impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him I want you to think back to where in the beginning of this The Book of Job and job warning then coming into job 2. of how that God was actually expressing to Satan that I've got a man up on Earth that I can that that I have confidence not in job's flesh but confidence in who job really was and he was through that life of the sacrifice that job was identified in God had confidence in his word you realize when God gives you or I a test or trial it isn't that he has confidence in our flesh because there are times through the trial that our flesh can question our flesh can't complain our flesh can cry we might as well be honest but God has confidence in that part which is really himself that is which is part of him this on the outside is not the Son and Daughter of God but the Son and Daughter of God is that part on the inside that God brings forth by the new birth that's why the Holy Spirit leads us to the place of a real New Birth it's God leading his children into the place in order for his life to come and Quicken fully that seed on the inside and what does it do it raises up a new creation not the old man reformed no but the spirit of God quickening power comes that there might come a transformation changing from one form to another is that right so here was a man a just man not in not not in that the job was in every way perfect but God declared imperfect how could job stand perfect because of job's confession was in the sacrifice that God had revealed job did not try to debate with it whether he was worried or not job's faith when confidence was in that sacrifice so when God was looking down and said have your concerned considered job he is a perfect man God was beholding job through the sacrifice let me just say to you tonight he's beholding you and I through the sacrifice let me just say to you as well no matter where you're at in your walk with God God couldn't even deal with you if there wasn't Blood On The Mercy Seat you might say I'm not worthy of him dealing with me no one not one of us have been worthy of his Mercy in dealing with us but there has been a perfect sacrifice and God is moving through that sacrifice to deal with you and I to dismantle our own doubts about ourselves to say me how could I ever be a Christian how could I ever be a believer it is the inspiration of God pouring through the sacrifice [Music] what kind of a man this was I'll tell you what kind of a man he was it was bright material I'm looking at Sons and Daughters of God that are the same caliber of people tonight God could bestow a confidence on him and he knew brother said that he would not Twist from his word or from his being job was a man that would carry out God's Commandments to the letter and Satan knew that too and when God said you can you can touch him you can touch all this round but don't you take his life and brother Brandman used these words and he says Satan stretched that as far as he could stretch it he turned his closest friends against him is that right family against him his wife her breath was strange to him is that right now that speaks volumes right there they broke all things right in there even in the midst of closeness of things but yet in the midst of it God had confidence that his word would stand the test and the trial in job's life but the RAM would say it like this I want to break in on this and I've heard but now I see he said when a man or person has once really come in contact with god with that genuine revealed faith that God is there's nothing no time nowhere can ever separate that man from his God Paul said there's no Strife no hunger no pearls neither living creatures or death or anything can separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus you are securely anchored in him because you were ordained to that life you didn't Merit it it was God in his grace even to brawl you and I to him to correct us to lead us into that place how would we no one is acceptable if God himself did not reveal himself to you and I that's Grace that we might receive that Grace and our lives be corrected by their Grace how is that how is that you were ordained for this life you ordained for it Satan thought he could twist him around a little bit puff him up make him do it but you see job with this perfect revelation of God and who God was and how God loved him it doesn't matter then I know how all of this is going to work out but to know who God is and I know he loves me oh yes Jesus Loves Me Not Just song but it's a Simplicity in our life as children of God [Applause] and this for me he's not only dealt with my life he deals with my life he ministers to my heart but he shed his own blood for me and he sent back the Holy Ghost for me I know he loves me I may [Applause] [Applause] not he waited no matter what the circumstance was he waited for his faith to be cons confirmed because he had had a grip on God a revelation Now watch how brother Ram will take this when the sick people that's in the building the crippled people or you that have a need of God when you can get that type of a revelation that you are Justified when you are actually justified in asking the thing that you're asking for and believe that he is a rewarder of those that diligently seek after him there's nothing can ever separate you from that Faith that's anchored to you but first it has to be revealed to you how many know that not only is the new birth of Revelation but for every need that God needs in our life it's God continuing to reveal himself right brother Brandon would tell us that the biggest part of our faith is mental faith right and he would tell us the night before he preaches this message he would tell us don't throw mental Faith away he said because mental faith if you can stay right with that that'll take you in to that Supernatural faith right the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass brother random called that the adopted baby cannot have a baby of their own but then they adopt a baby there's an example here and there's an example right now you know of a certain music gospel music that we we listen to my family but at any rate here it is they adopted a child and it's exactly I told my wife the other day I said that's exactly what the prophet said because you know what happens with the adopted baby it takes the pressure off they can begin to relax they can begin to rest and that's why God gives his word it's not about what you think what you see or what you feel it's to take the word and confess the word that has come to you he is the high priest of our confession right brother Ram said you confess it you keep saying it until you believe it is that right he would go on to say in the Inner Man this the inside man that runs the ship not the outside man that's out here looking it's the inside man that makes him move but he said it's got to come from here down here and brother Randall would tell us over and over and over what is it he said continue to confess God's word that's why when you've ever come for any promise of God you confess it and you stay right with it because God when he made a promise he does not lie and when God has confirmed that promise to you that's for you to take a hold of that promise and say God I'm going to stand right here because you've revealed this promise and you'll come through every area of my life till that word becomes flesh in me Hallelujah mark 11. let's go into some of these principles here and hear Jesus they're passing by and the Bible says in Mark 11 21 and Peter calling to remember and said unto him Master behold the Fig Tree which thou cursed is withered away remember it had leaves but it didn't have figs right it was showing it shouldn't even had leaves but it was showing leaves so the leaves is why Jesus came to look for figs although he knew it wasn't time for figs so what was he dealing with he's getting down to the matter of things that would be truth from within now watch what he deals with here in verse 22 and Jesus answering and said unto them have faith in God remember he's calling look master that the Fig tree's dried up and he says have faith in God what was Jesus speaking to the life the life you see it indeed him address the outside and the leaves with her he did not say leaves wizard that's why you can try to change yourself on the outside and it's like trying to put on new leaves but let the spirit of God go down to the very root and then it's not changing leaves the life that was supplying to those leaves those attributes of unbelief Trey's up why because the very root is cursed then New Life takes hold and then there are new leaves that come on amen what does that the word of God addressing the issue in our life for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart and I want you to notice this shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore I say unto you what things soever you desire when ye pray believe that ye shall receive them and ye shall have them and when you stand praying forgive if you have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven May forgive you your trespasses but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses and brother Ronald would stop right after that scripture in perfect faith and say to you and I faith is based on forgiveness now watch what he's saying and it's not just us forgiving others remember Jesus is dealing here in verse 25 and 26 with things that can hinder the principle work of faith that sometimes we it's understanding what's going on what's happening but it's a moment to examine our lives and knowing that all of this that as we are standing and we're always we are tried within this not just within the body of Believers here we are tried among our families we are tried in our jobs these are things these are just some areas that the enemy would like to place doubt in our heart you're saying well I don't doubt the word I don't doubt that God is but you see when there are things in verse 25 and verse 26 that are not where they ought to be that is doubt in the heart and the mountain can't move are you hearing me now so this is where brother Brown watch how he says this faith is based on forgiveness then and then it's these we said this morning it's not a perfect faith Trump were trying to get the people the church into the place to where we could really see Apostolic times moving Among Us that's what we all hunger and it's just laying right at the door we see it but we want to see more of it watch how he says it we want such a flow that it'll be a help to us and US flow out to others I want to see more of him and me I want to see more of him and me I want more of his life not just not just from me I want his life I just want to be a channel that his life can flow as a testimony to others he did it for brother Sammy he'd do it for anybody I want his life to I want it to be a Channel of encouragement of and refreshment of where it can it can encourage faith not not even maybe that if something that I have to say but just just his presence just being a conduit for his presence to be able to come is that right non-examination these things as I'm just pouring over you know it and looking and this particular chapter I have just I've meditated and very pondered since well probably since it was it has been since late last fall and some other things that I just you know in putting things down and looking out in this in this job 23 but I want to just deal with this part this thought on examination and you know there's re routine examinations that we have to go through sometimes whether it's our health or there's Building Inspections and everything else and those of you that know you work in factories and other places too there's certain times where even that they do mandatory shutdowns one of the brothers that I went with that I would travel to to be in order to go into Mexico last year that brother works on the the petroleum big petroleum plants it's very very dangerous of the things they do but it's where they have only certain amount of time that the petroleum companies are able to shut down and then they have to go through and do all of these maintenance things that are to be done pressurized and it's all of those things I couldn't even begin to relay all of it here tonight but it's enough that it has to be examined it's not just well we think we got a problem that's one thing but this is what we're talking about where there's routine examinations we know that even when we are looking at this this is why let me just say it like this this is why that we do not forsake to assemble ourselves together because the word of God has come to examine Our Lives now I hope you understand what I'm saying here I when we and I speak here in other places that the holy spirit will give utterance I'm not against streaming but I'm against streaming when it takes the place of us putting in perseverance to be in the house of God I think we're falling short when we could be here but instead we say well it's you know I'm a little tired I'm a little weary but you know there Comes A Time you you show what side you're on there's a time to persevere we're living listen we're living in an age an age of where everything is easy and let me just say it like this if you can apply the same model or mode of well you know I'm just a little tired I'm not going to go to the family picnic or I'm just a little tired I you know I'm not going to go to work today you know I'm just I'm just feeling a little bit back but if we in ourselves will push ourselves in other areas of our life that are not even the main reasons we're here for God did not bring us here upon this Earth in order for us to work are you hearing me church I'm not if if you know if I was so against it we wouldn't even have the streaming but I see to where that there are things and it's to to to admonish this is why we come to the house of God and I understand the thought can be asked well what's the difference if I'm sitting at home we're a part of a body yeah it's just like you going to a restaurant with all of us and you decide you're going to go sit in the corner of the restaurant and say well I went out with everybody to the same restaurant right that doesn't seem right you see being here being a part of the body I know I've talked not only to others but I've experienced it myself it's not the same as being here being in his presence and it's I know God has given Grace at moments when I've had to be in other places and I've sensed his presence as I've streamed the service but you know what if God wanted to use me to pray for somebody else I can't reach my hand through my phone my hand won't go through my iPad my hand won't go through the computer but God I am a part of the body I'm a conduit I want to be here in the atmosphere of the holy spirit for a routine examination [Music] I know I've used some I've used some of these doctors and situations where I speak to them on the phone I know they got clinics now where you go and you've been on the screen but it's not the same as having a doctor say come here all right or the doctors put it put the stethoscope breathe in breathe out not the same they cannot do that they can only go by what I'm telling them but when I'm in the presence of my doctor he can see more than what I'm telling him [Applause] he can look deeper into those things oh my he's not just writing out a generic prescription but he's dealing personally understand you see so it has streaming it has its place and that's not even a point here in my notes it has its place but I think this is where we must examine how are we using it are we using it so we can do other things on midweek service are we doing it well well outstream Thursday night on Friday morning how are we using it that's a necessary examination are you hearing me it is not about us making the word convenient for us it's us being available for him is that right talking about examination the Bible said forsake not to assemble yourselves together because the Bible tells us that the trial of our faith is more precious than gold is that right and many times those are scriptures that can be spoken or said or proclaimed in the midst of adversity and it's very true but yet it all has to come down to there are many forms of adversity trials test and then there's also chastening we must find where we are in order for faith to declare God is we must find where we are in order for Faith to declare and be certain of God because we could be declaring it's a oh this is a trial of my faith and yet there's nothing coming out of our life we continue in the same way let me tell you when God molds a person through a trial we're never the same it's more of us how many testimonies I have tonight on that less of me and more of him so that's the outcome of a trial so God bringing us into a purpose or to the principle we want to be certain of God that our faith is positioned to wait on the Lord even when he's silent because God will break his silence but in the meantime we want to have faith that is waiting in silence brother Brown says it like this in perfect Faith Abraham had to believe just what the voice told him and when he was a hundred years old 25 years later he was Stronger believing it than he was 25 years ago when it was give to him he believed it and he staggered knotted the promise of God through unbelief but was strong giving praise to God knowing that he was able to perform what he had promised and that's the way everyone must be that way let me just let me just comment on this just a moment Abraham what where and what brother random is referring to he had to yield to what the voice was saying Abraham even after the now the corrections misunderstandings of the promise you realize there was a period of time that Abraham had to wake up in the camp and see one before him that he realized I listened to my wife right he had Ishmael before him right he had all of these things that the enemy could try to come upon him and say look at you you failed time and time again you've tried to do things in your own way you've run down to Egypt you told a lie down there look at you you lost a lot he could the enemy could try to pour it on you say well brother saman what was it that Abraham was able to resist in a faith because his faith at the beginning came from hearing God speak to him so when the word would come and bring correction to Abraham's life Abraham not did not repent just because it was wrong his heart sent a man to the word of God and He Walked In God's word and that's why when the enemy could come there to accuse him he could stand Justified because he knew I am done all that God has said do when God said repent I have repented because my desire is to please the Lord principles for Faith to operate notice he says You must come with an unfailing faith believing that God made the promise but now you have to be in a position to have that Faith so be in a position to have that faith and that's what we're going to talk on to receive that faith First Corinthians 11 28. but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup let me just pause for a moment faith is sovereignly given let me just deal with this a moment when the New Birth has come it is where the faith of God that's been coming and influencing our faith has now come into the place there's come a uniting now it's not just us living by our own faith but now it's God's faith behind our faith when our faith would fail his faith abideth faithful is that right that's what Paul said I'm living by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me so there's a a faith that that that is operating from within and in situations in our life when it comes to a medical and financial all the different needs situations that can arise loved ones and things like that there's things that we could go and say well I'm just going to speak it and this is going to happen this way and we can find ourselves all frustrated because remember a word is sovereignly given by God no I don't understand there's a confession and we confess the promise of God but to speak and say this is how it's going to be that's a word that's sovereignly given from God is that right we can't I I we I can't work myself into it you can't we can't we can't pull it out we can't pull it out of anybody brother Brown remember he had people wanting to try to pull it out of him brother Brandon he'll just come and do this and if you'll just come it's that's not God was showing us that's not how he operates right there's some right motives there's right objectives with in everything so then we find that with this on faith think about when sister meedy was in this situation the tumor had come up in her life right you know the background the situation and what she had said to brother Brandon I don't want to deliberate on that for because that's not the point I want to make the point I'm looking at is here she comes to that place of where that she's the day before surgery and the Holy Spirit drops down in the hotel room in Shreveport and though and and and and brother Brown begins to make known to God Lord she stood between me and the public she's on my shirt she's and my clothes she's never said this Lord all of these things and the Holy Spirit said stand upon your feet and how you say it it shall be that's how it shall be and he spoke that word and then he called sister media he said tell him to give you one more examination what happened Faith dropped at that moment so don't let the enemy tell you that you don't have faith already from where you're standing but every situation must be God revealing his will and his word in that situation we're not wrong for saying by his stripes I'm Healed that's his word right brother random said he says this right here is even more sure the division yes is that right it doesn't matter the perfect faith God has already said it why was the Visions to declare that God is and what God has said that he steal God to keep his word that's why God made himself known in this generation that's why God continues to make himself known to you and I let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup examine yourselves whether you be in the faith and prove your own self so notice this examining of ourselves it really takes a lot of honesty to examine ourselves now I'm not talking about the examining to where we put ourselves in a rabbit hole that's not what I'm talking about when God's word comes and as the Lord is dealing with our life and for us to examine ourselves in the light of God's word is not an invitation of condemnation but it is to examine ourselves that there might be certain things corrected it would be like this what if I just threw this shirt on and I never looked in the mirror and maybe there was a big old spot that was right here and then here I get up here tonight and then I have people looking at the spot instead of looking at me I don't know which one would look worse but anyhow you get the picture but you see a lot of things you will put on and you examine in the mirror you look at it first I maybe look at how my battalion's position look at certain things and you you checking it out what are you doing examining yourself if you look and you see a spot on your shirt you don't say oh there's no spot on my shirt no you change your shirt and listen this is the grace that God gives you and I to examine ourselves not to condemn ourselves examine ourselves so when we understand that here Faith must have we want Faith to have a Clear Channel for so it's available faith can flow through it this is why David said if I regard Psalm 66 18 if I regard iniquity in my heart the Lord will not hear me right if there's iniquity things that we know that's not right God will not hear us not only will he not hear us but it doesn't matter how anointed the man is that will pray for us same thing all right the prayer does not Cast Away the iniquity you have that Authority are you hearing me tonight you have that Authority but see how Satan wants to bring fear you see how deceitful Sin is Sin Works to bring fear to bring doubt to bring confusion to cause you to back away from the presence of God and God's desire is that we would stand in his presence Justified that's why the scripture could say my little children I write unto you sin not but if we sin we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous he is the perpetuation of our sins and not of our sins only but of the whole world so what are you saying there's no excuse the doors are open the windows are open [Applause] there's a sacrifice that's already been made if I regarding iniquity in my heart the Lord will not hear me but verily God has heard me he has attended to the voice of my prayer First John 3 20. 40 of our heart condemn us God is greater than our hearts and knoweth all things beloved if our heart condemn us not then we have confidence toward God and whatsoever we ask we receive of him because we keep his Commandments and do those things that are pleasing in his sight you see this is where when we're looking at principles the position for Faith to operate through how how did that faith of Elohim reproduce itself in Abraham's life because Abraham walked with God and all that God asked him to do every correction every word Abraham continued to present himself in an examination before God so examinations and screenings are a part of our lives in the natural it's like maintenance checkups to ensure that things are running into individual capacity you know you don't keep up with your car it'll affect major parts right you don't take account of regular Parts in our body it can lead to affect other things is that right don't worry this is still a church it's not a clinic but you see it's everything that we would be in good health this is why David could say in Psalms 26 2 examine Me O Lord and prove me trauma Reigns in my heart search me o God Psalms 139 and know my heart try me and know my thoughts that's my desire why I want to remain in that position God if there's things that need to be uncovered uncover it is that right see why why we're in the midst of a test or trial remember tests and trials are permitted by God not as correction chastening is his correction right and these are the things that with when we're in the midst of a tester trout like job was we want to be in a position for Faith to operate and wait on God we don't want to be tied down where there's iniquity bubbling up and there's things that are just not uh the checkups aren't going right let me say this to you let me go on let me let me go on verse 24 and see if there be any wicked way in me and Lead Me in the way Everlasting you know I I know I'm speaking there's plenty of medical things here maybe we could open a clinic all these medical individuals in here God bless you thank you you know a wellness exam it's a preventative care and you know as you start getting into my it seems like from whenever in the beginning you know when you are I remember the earliest times of my life I I I actually remember my mom worked she worked on the second floor the first floor of that building was the health department I hated going by those stairs there was a little nurse that she was about this tall little gray-haired woman but boy she could pack a punch with a with a felt like it was a bazooka but it was a shot hated them shots and you know when you're you're getting those shots when you're at a young age it seems like they keep on you know they're like you know and here they are the little kids are walking you know and they give you a sucker like that's supposed to you know replace getting shot up like that but you know they give you like because when you're going to school you they have your shot records and all this right here you know we don't want you passing rabies to the next person and all this I mean you know it's things they're trying to do as preventative right then you come into all other times of your life you start getting older and they start saying um time to start having this screening done time to start having this screening done time to start having this screening done time to start having this screening done and by the way in the middle of all these screenings go ahead and pick out your burial plots you know what I'm saying not and bringing this down to our individual walk with God many times it's Wellness exams that people don't want because what is it it becomes fearful what if they find something then it'll give you more time perhaps they can address the situation before it spreads in the church I mean spreads to your I mean spreads to other things in your life they can address it before it eventually affects your whole family and affects you it's called Wellness examination talking about standing in a position for Faith to be a lot of times you know how it is you come into that examination they check your height and you hope that the scale isn't working that day maybe some of you do I don't know and look at that and I think you know and they're sliding out you think man this come on now let it stop right there nope come over here oh and there's more you know and they're checking you know why because as they're checking with our aides they're checking the height they're checking weight and the other thing they do with I'm not talking about when we're sick I'm just talking about Wellness when we feel good you know I'm not sure not many of us go to the doctor when we feel good why are you here I mean I'm here for a wellness check that's called a health nerd nah I'm not discouraging that I know there's a lot of things that come along in that way there's a lot of brothers that actually have been benefited even in the brother I just spoke for uh where they're able to go through and he had an open heart surgery and just doing phenomenal but I I say it in this way that there are things that they begin to look at with family history they begin to review the medical oh you see what it is is that it begins to look at that you've had a problem with forgiveness in your family so we need to let the word hone in on this because though you can be connected with the Tree of Life but you don't want your natural to rule over the spiritual other Can Be Strings and channels and things that we want to look at and say God in my life I don't know about anybody else in my family but in my life the cycle stops here right here the Cycle's broken we're not going to go through the recycle of Revival and death right here the cycle stops right they ask you to bring a lot of copies of medical records and you know current medications you're on you come to the house of God there's things you're praying about in your own life I Trust You Are Lord there's things that I I want to Lord grant me overcoming in this area of my life Lord I need strength in this room in my life I need direction and Discerning my life you're coming there are needs that you have and you're praying and you're bringing your needs before God that's a wellness examination but then there's times when the doctor can find something through that Wellness examination and he says hey we need to do something here like my father-in-law said him back there they did the they did an open heart surgery but you know before they did that open heart surgery and I remember many different things with my dad as well before they just you know took him out and put him on the table and every he had to go through some other tests to make sure when they did that it would take effect so sometimes God deals with our life in areas but he has to examine how is your blood doing how is your life doing where is your walk with God and what's he doing he'll begin to examine our ears what if your ears been entertaining what have your eyes been seeing what has your mouth been speaking what has your mind been dwelling upon where is your heart at in this situation well have your feet man where are your goings he begins to examine why so that we might be in a perfect position for the procedure to take effect a position for Faith to be able to stand and say I'm certain I've done all that he's told me to do everything he's brought to my attention I've made it right I confess that I I've lined myself with him that faith might have a channel to operate through what a privilege what a privilege to be examined by the Holy Spirit but REM said so many times in my life he said I've had to trace down through my life turn over stones and find is there anything Lord that's out of line because if our heart condemns us God won't hear us if we regard iniquity in our heart now maybe sitting here tonight there's you know there's nothing in your heart nothing in our hearts but this is a principle to understand if there is anything in our life and let me just say this God is not one you've heard me always say this he doesn't make you guess the Bible said if our heart condemns us God is greater than our heart and you know what God has a way of so dealing with our lives to help us that our life there's a walk and there's a balance with him we want to stay in a place I just close on this tonight to where our lives are a channel that faith can flow through a channel that where we're able to stand when God is silent we can say God I'm standing here waiting on you to confirm my faith because my faith is fixed in you Lord and you know to the of the of the grace that's given that if there's anything that's out of line this is the grace that's given to us like it was to Abraham we are seeds of Abraham if there's anything make it right you've got to make it right with somebody go make it right with somebody there's things that has to be confessed and made right make it right before God if there's something God's dealt with your life on make it right with God and then you're able to stand there and say I know where I'm standing I know where I'm standing God in his grace dealing with our life bringing us into that position is that where you want to be that's why I want to dwell I want to dwell in that place sensitive to his presence when there's things that isn't working right I wanted I will lord it's not you that's not working it's me see we want to have a faith to where it's not just oh this trial that I'm in and it may not be a trial friends I don't say that to condemn or put anybody down but I think sometimes we call all adversity trials and tests and all adversity is not trials and tests some adversity is chastening it's correction that God wants to come and get our attention that we not turn our attention on everybody else but in our own self is that the spot on my shirt I'm not looking at your shirt I'm looking at my shirt I'm not looking at your time looking at my time I'm looking at who I am beholding in the mirror is that right because every man must rise and fall to his own master and so we recognize it let every man examine himself and we can stand there in the word of God and allow the Holy Spirit to just examine and when I say allowing him say yes Lord be it unto me and allow the spirit of God just to come down and if there's anything that's not right God will come right down as we invite him through a real repentance what does he do he cleans it out that we might have a channel that's why even in any promise of God that you're seeking for you might be seeking for the Holy Ghost you might be seeking for healing all of those things is Faith revealed but let me just say to you what do you do after you come to a routine exam what do you do I mean for those of you that have insurance what do you do after you go to a doctor's visit do you just take the paperwork and say throw it on the table I know sometimes we don't like what the doctor is going to say to us he starts looking at our weight oh you know we're wanting to hear words that are pleasing years doing so well my your physique is perfect you're BMI is precious instead when they start getting along them lines we know when they start dealing with certain areas they're going to start messing with our diets they're going to start telling us about things that we are enjoying we like but you know what there comes a time that we have to come to that place and listen to what the doctor is saying now I'm talking about Dr Jesus tonight he ain't like the political machines of this nation that tells you don't eat eggs and then they come back and eat eggs and don't eat butter and don't this G I'm God and I change a lot are you hearing me it don't matter what form sin is still sin there might be more forms of it but it's still sin and what does he deal with these things that can affect and hinder our lives what do we do with routine results what do we do when we come to the house of God when we leave out of here do we come for an examination to examine to let take the word that's coming and come across our lives or always sitting there saying you better not say nothing about my way he better not if he starts touching this you see what it is you already know you got a problem you already know you got a problem and now you got a complex about your weight or the ACT who's doing that the devil let's expose him it's a spirit it's not you let's call him out for who he is what do we do with routine exams I want to say it might Strip Me Down that God help me being unto me Lord according Thy Word if my let me bring it break over into natural if my natural part is still saying yeah but I like these certain things Twinkies I hate Twinkies but let me just say Twinkies somebody might like them Twinkies oh I like Twinkies then you know what I would say God take the desire from Twinkies from my life that's how honest I would be I'm let word be added on top of word the doctor has revealed that Lord I don't want to go that way I see if I continue to eat Twinkies where I'd be I see if I continue to go that way where I'll be Lord take that desire out of my life what are you asking you're asking for the word not to change your leaves you're asking for the word to go down to the root in your life what do we do with those routine results how do we respond with them I say this keep coming keep coming let's do checkup after checkup let's keep saying Amen to every word of God why that the heart procedure will take an effect that there will be nothing in our heart that will hinder God's word from flowing through our lives if we've got vows that are clogged up let's let him who's present to able to unclog and dissolve every part of our life Hallelujah we got one here oh before they ever did a heart transplant God already said I'll give you a new heart attack and a new spirit Hallelujah a new way of thinking blessed be his name Hallelujah let's just bow our heads amen anybody who want to be remembered in prayers the musicians are coming hallelujah amen I got my hands up let's pray together let's just take the the precious words of Dr Jesus oh it's the same doctor bag that Dr Moses had same prescription no matter what a role was in the camp I'm the Lord that healeth all that diseases forgive us all thine iniquities notice how God placed that first oh God how we desire to be channels imposition that faith can flow I believe that's what the word has brought us to in this hour that's God's desire coming to you and I let's pray father your word Lord you've sent your word and it will not return back to you void Lord You've spoken very personally to our hearts not to condemn us but that God that not only tonight that we would examine our lives but to realize that every time as we're coming to the house of God and each day in our lives it's examining ourselves Lord not condemning ourselves but taking the word the standard of the word and examining ourself by you Lord help us Lord even in the areas of our life that God would be uncomfortable may we Lord put our hand in your hand and God walked down through every Corridor in our life Lord father every area every channel that Faith itself might be able to flow and move through our lives for we ask it now in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen amen don't you love him for the Brian's seeing something that's on your heart brother amen if you'd like to stand you're more welcome to amen if you'd like prayer tonight be

begins to talk about iniquity he talks about that dealing in his life with the tax case takes a good period of time in that service and brother Bram comes to the end of it and he's asking for the people he said I wonder how many he said would be willing to stand and say God I've got iniquity but I'm asking you to forgive me it's things that I'm standing in need of and how the Holy Spirit would would beckon those things sometimes you know it's things that we can look at and we can try to say well this really don't matter that don't mean too much but you know everything matters everything matters the Bible tells us the little foxes spoil the vine and so everything matters and brother Brian will come to the end of that this is what I want you to see he said you know sometimes even how God can take situations he said even iniquity and through that draws closer to him now I've listened to that multiple times and I just was listening to it again on the way in on the on the on the first leg of the flight yesterday and how brother Brown said you know what it is how God will draw us closer he said because we realize if God take would take his hand off our lives for a moment where would we be you know it makes us to realize God I want every part of my life in your hands come on every part of my life in your hands Lord every part Lord covered Overlord just cover it over with prayer cover it over with confession just cover me with Jesus Lord let my life don't let me walk thinking I I feel all right right now but just let my life stay covered with Jesus covered over with confession covered over with prayer covered over with the word cover it over with the spirit heal me oh Lord and I will [Music] oh save me and I will be saved [Music] yes Lord oh Lord oh and I will be for God the one I pray today oh you are the one I pray [Music] Hallelujah let's just we want to just go to the Lord in prayer amen and just as we're being dismissed presence of one another I want to just say we know different ones of you have been to see sister Doris and she's right out there at the Ava Avon Cleveland Clinic right off Nagle Road it's the rehabilitation part so it's beyond the hospital and I know she had spoke to me even of different ones that have come and I think sister Caroline you were even there last night as well and and you know friends what those what that means in the midst of this moment and so we were there this morning and early this afternoon and you know we want to continue to pray for sister Doris through this through this time and that God will just see her through and I gave the testimony as I stood there today son and daughter was in the room and I gave the testimony of where God brought my dad through where he had lost all form of speech could not even move his right side and God completely restored him and so God is still the same and God cares sometimes friends the way God works we may not understand but I just say that in the midst of this right here as we stood there today just just to minister to encourage to strengthen and I know that I know that God has everything in control and so you know we want to continue to pray for him sister Doris God will just move for her and touch her she still with the problems with the walking but there's been improvements as far as able to touch now the with her left hand the index finger to the nose we say praise God every every it will take every inch every footstep is possession so we thank God for that and then it is every step by step as things continue to come along and for the mark and sunny and Olivia were there and you know she was wanting to talk to me and I said you you know I was wanting to tell her you know you don't have you don't have to say much at all but I know she has to that's part of the therapy they had they they were telling her mom taking a deep breath now and talk Ed then her voice got louder when she would take that in so just continue to pray for him and uh you know as uh go out and you know make your way out and visit her uh her and brother Mark I know it it means a lot and uh you know just to just to be there and just to encourage him and they pointed out the flowers and those different things so amen God bless you amen you know what the Bible said he's not quick to forget our work and labor of love and the Bible says his brother Brahm tells us and actually his brother Neville was praying and brother Neville in the midst of the prayer five identifications of the Church of the Living God he said God let us remember and go and minister to others that are in hard trials in in tough moments knowing that we ourselves will come into hard times as well just want to be a channel and we want to pray for the Holy Spirit just to move our sister I know there's many other and I know there's different other needs as well that are among us that are just as important there's no need that's less important every need God looks at it the same way you know I just heard brother Branham say today I was pulling out and I was listening to the message again be certain of God just going back through it and and brother REM said think about it God knows about your needs and my needs and he said if the Bible said he was mindful of a sparrow said you could take a whole bunch of sparrows and put them together he said and nobody would even give you a penny for him he said because you could find out what's what's a value to a sparrow and he said to think he knows everything about a sparrow and he knows everything about you and I that just blessed me so good I was pulling out there in the traffic it blessed me so I said Thank You Lord how you think about us Lord that if you know all of that of a sparrow how much more aren't you glad amen Paul would you come dismiss Us in the word of Prayer dear crying gracious Heavenly Father Lord how we just love you tonight Lord Jesus how we thank you Lord for the word that you brought to us Lord Jesus through your servant tonight Lord Jesus said Lord Jesus for a re-examination lord Jesus for examination orgies of Our Lives Lord Jesus and how that your word Lord Jesus it Lord it cuts even the very morals of our our bones Heavenly Father Lord Jesus and how it just or that your word Lord It's like a sword Lord divides Lord Jesus and cuts us Lord Jesus and it shapes us and Moses unto who you want us to be
