hallelujah amen and amen amen how true that is tonight amen a testimony that not only what he has done but what he's doing and he will do great things amen you know I just just listening to the prophet again here today and how that he was just speaking of sheep and brother Bram talked aled about he said you know when they brand those sheep he said every brand that the that the Sheep wear it matches the print that's in the hand of the shepherd so that what's on the sheep is in the hand of the shepherd Hallelujah he said you know you could take a shepherd and he said you can have cattle they can have goats and sheep and they said well you know brother Bram asked you said well how does that work and those men said well you know being a Shepherd they'll kind of be able to know how to work with the different ones but they said just stick around at nightfall and watch what happens and at nightfall the shepherd went out and when the shepherd begin to speak at nightfall the goats didn't respond cattle didn't respond but the Sheep responded because the Sheep are seeking for safety so there's one thing that that sorts out sheep and that's his voice Jesus said my sheep know my voice and I'm known of them aren't you glad to be able to hear his voice I tell you that's the greatest treasure there is to be ble to hear his voice and to have a heart that's tuned into it to say be it unto me Lord according to thy will that is a great great value in this hour Amen to be able to hear his voice amen we just thank God for his Mercy tonight so thankful for the opportunity he's given us to be able to gather together anden so thankful to have friends and visitors here with us and different ones but we're just we're looking forward to What the Lord Has for us every time we come together God has something special for us amen God does call a meeting just to call a meeting I know we sometimes we get used to Thursday Sunday but you know those are only prescribed times that we have but God is the one who calls the meeting amen so we just want to welcome brother Cadre and so thankful Amen brother Cadre is here with us tonight and we just want to pull on the gift of God Amen so as our brother would come and make his way here to minister the word of the Lord amen we just want him to obey the Lord and just a the liberty and for the Holy Spirit most importantly that he would have the right away here tonight I believe we've all come here with one purpose and it should be the purpose is I want to leave closer to God than when I came in sir and sometimes that closeness is just letting God help us to sort out whatever it is that's got between him and us we still feel the pull but you know how it is when you can get all those other things cleared out then that magnetism that channel becomes even stronger and God is present to guide us as we come to House of God May our lives and our hearts when we leave out of here tonight our hearts have been set on fire amen anything that's in between us we've been able to say everything has been cleared out and God has the right away amen that's what we want here tonight amen for he have done great things oh he great for

Lord bless his family church family in Jesus name we pray the church say amen amen the church say hallelujah hallelujah oh my is isn't God good isn't God good amen praise the Lord amen we certainly enjoyed all the worship let's turn to Genesis chapter 32 amen good to see everybody thank God for all of you that are here Genesis 32 we're going to kind of um Jump Around in here a little bit by God's grace let's start at verse um verse n Genesis 32 and N if you have a amen the Bible says and Jacob said oh god of My Father Abraham and the god of my father Isaac the Lord which Sith unto me return unto thy country and to thy Kindred and I will deal with Thee I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies and of all the truth which thou has showed unto my servant for with with my staff I passed over this Jordan and now I am become two bands deliver me I pray thee from the hand of my brother from the hand of Esau for I fear Him lest he will come and smite me and the mother with my children let's drop down to verse 204 and Jacob was left alone and there Wrestled a man with him until the breaking of day breaking of the day and when he saw that he prevailed not against him he touched he touched the hollow of his thigh and the hollow of Jacob's th was out of joint as he wrestled with him and he said let me go for the day breakthe will not let thee go except thou bless me and he said unto him what is thy name and he said Jacob and he said my name shall thy name shall be called No More Jacob but Israel for as a prince has has thou power with God and with men and has prevailed hallelujah amen may the Lord bless reading of his word you can have your seats as you as you're sitting let's turn over I'm thinking about the scripture let's turn over to Mark chapter 5 St Mark believe that's what I want chapter five St Mark chapter 5 and verse um let's just read verse 24 Mark 5 and 24 and Jesus went with him and much people followed him and thronged him and a certain woman which had an issue of blood 12 years and had suffered many things of many Physicians and had spent all that she had and was nothing better but rather go worse when she heard of Jesus when she when she heard of Jesus came in the press and touched His Garment for she said if I may touch but his clothes I shall be whole amen may the Lord had a bless him to the reading of his word L amen you know by the grace of God tonight I want to um use for a subject uh the point of Conta the point of contact amen that's and I know as Believers I know I'm not the only one who feel like this but to me the most important thing in my life is to know that I have an audience with God to know that when I come to church God is here when I'm at home God is here when I'm in my car God is here in the most important times of my life when I really need to touch God he's available for me to touch him amen amen and you know church I believe that we are to have a mindset amen that uh uh God wants to be touched Hallelujah yes sir Hallelujah God wants to provide your needs God wants to heal your body God wants to deliver you God wants to restore your joy that's who he is amen but you know church if we would for a moment tonight just think about the the point of contact Hallelujah and you know if I can let's let's let's go over to 1 Samuel uh Chapter 30 first 1 Samuel chapter 30 and you know this is the scene where David and his men you know they they came back from Battle and when they came back their children and their wives were gone you know their sons were gone their daughters were gone and their wives were gone and you know you think about this this this this scene right here you know what happened uh uh to David's men and and David wasn't a result of sin in their lives Hallelujah sometimes you'll go through things because God wants to show who he is and you know one thing about David amen David was a man who had already had contact with God so when situations arose he didn't just act wildly Hallelujah he didn't just say I'm going put this in my own hands but what he did see the thing about a point of contact it makes you to remember Hallelujah it helps you to remember Hallelujah when you're in a certain scene you know uh uh but two weeks ago by God's grace I was flying out of the airport in Carolina and as I as I do most of the time I'll you know when I'm gone I'll just park my car there and and and and so I won have to wait on nobody when I get back Hallelujah so when I'm there cuz after I preached and and I'm back home I don't want to get the phone call where you at that aggravates me where you at you knew what time my plane was Landing we already worked this out you shouldn't be on the highway you should be there waiting on me hallelujah amen but that's neither here or there but Hallelujah but that's just a little insight amen Church you know as I got there like I normally do I parked in a longterm parking and and I'm going down following the arrows where you say there's a opening and as I'm going down I see a bus a bus is coming and I know Hallelujah that this is their parking lot so I yielded Hallelujah I yielded to give the bus to ride away I want you to understand something tonight this church belongs to you and whether you realize it or not the devil has to get out of your way the devil has to yield the right away because this worship belongs to you the word of God belongs to you the atmosphere belongs to you and whatever attribute of Christ is in the building tonight belongs to you and Satan has to get out of the way but you got to know who you are Hallelujah you got to know what's taking place and you know church as as I and I and I saw that she didn't judge it right and as she be to turn I said this lady is going to hit my car now there was one thing I could do I could blow the act crazy and try to move out the way or I could brace myself for impact and you know what Hallelujah brother Samuel there are too many too many people in church getting out of the way when God is trying to make a contact he sees exactly where you are he knows exactly Hallelujah where to hit you but there's too many of us afraid of the contact but I want you tonight to brace yourself Hallelujah because there's something that God wants to do in this building with you now are you ready to be touched by God or is this just another Thursday night church it was a regular old day I had been to that parking lot Hallelujah time after time after time but this time something different was going to happen something was going to contact me in a way Hallelujah I wasn't ready for and church as she turned she hit my bumper and then then the rest of the the rest of the bus begin to scrape the side of my car and I'm like this woman didn't ah now if that was me 20 years ago or a little bit longer than that come on now I've been on the other side a long time now Hallelujah you know it's a blessing when you've been serving God longer than you been in the world Amen that's a blessing Hallelujah I got more on the other side now Hallelujah that other person is just a vague memory Hallelujah in church Hallelujah as as as as you know she hit my bus and and and I begin to think amen if this was me years and years ago before I made contact that situation would have been different Hallelujah maybe I would have jumped out of my car because there was a time I was in love with my car oh that's good that's a good that was a time when I dressed it up Hallelujah when I put those shiny spoks on it and those clean wheels har and that nice paint job and those humps in the top and those gold buttons going around with that booming music inside I was in love with something that couldn't love me back [Applause] [Music] oh my I wonder how many people are still in love with things that cannot love you back the world will never love you back the devil will never love you back social media will never love you back right Hallelujah there are things that you come in contact with that really has no benefit is just there for a space and time to deal with your memory and church if that was me back then back in those days when I was so in love with my ride Hallelujah I would have begin to act the fool cuz I would have said you know all the time I put into this all the money I spent and you just going to hit it Hallelujah she didn't deliberately hit it but because of the state I was in all right back then because of the state I was in I would have been looking to blame somebody Hallelujah for what was taking place in my life oh my and too often things are happening around the world things are happening inside the church and instead of us looking at ourselves we want to blame somebody else with all God is trying to do is make a contact Hallelujah remember I said David didn't do any wrong his men didn't do any wrong but God was F to show them something hallelujah oh my that's so good hallelu yes sir Lord Oh Praise the Lord and church as I as I look and I begin to let me get this right right quick well don't worry about it let's go church when I when I look and I begin to see the scene and and now uh uh uh my car has been hit and this is the first time I've ever been in an accident in that car and now uh my Bumper's messed up my my my Fender's messed up and I'm looking at this and then something came over me and said hey I wonder how she feels so you know what I did church I went over to her and I said hey and I could see she was a little nervous I didn't know how long she was on the job and I begin to ask her how long you been on the job and all these things and she said about a year Hallelujah you know sometimes people be on probation for about a year hallelujah or maybe 90 days or whatever it was but God hallelujah put in my spirit I want you to go make her feel better there you go yes sir even though she hit your car I want you to go make her feel better Hallelujah I think about this church how often somebody's done you wrong and oh come on now how often somebody in church has said something bad about you or did you wrong Hallelujah and you sh them the next time you see them Hallelujah church I know two prominent preachers who were fussing Hallelujah one was fussed against the other and the other didn't really want to fuss and now they had a chance to come to a meeting in this area and everybody knew that they were fussing Hallelujah one of one one one was openly destroying the other brother's character and influence all open and the other one he was just taking it and now they're getting to this wedding they had this wedding and everybody's looking cuz both of them are there and they said brother what are you going to do when you see him he said when I see him I'm going to embrace him because he's never experienced this kind of love before hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah church love can conquer demon power love can shake the enemy loose how do you operate in those times of adversity Hallelujah but look I went over to her and I said hey hey don't worry about me I'm good I ain't one of those people who going to say my neck my back that's good Hallelujah I begin to tell her there was something in me that said reassure her give her Assurance let her know everything is going to be all right and you know I went over to her like I said and I said hey I'm good I I ain't worried about none of this I say my back ain't hurting my neck ain't hurting ain't nothing hurting all I want is my car to get fixed and I said you know what the company you work for got plenty enough money to do it I said so don't you worry about nothing Hallelujah they ain't hurting they they shouldn't take nothing out your check this is the city and they got plenty of money Hallelujah and as I begin to talk to her she started to smile what was happening Hallelujah the spirit in me was making a contact Hallelujah the spirit of God was making a contact with the person Hallelujah who may have felt a little down in that moment may have felt a little distraught in that moment church what do you do when you meet [Music] unbelievers that's good good that's good you we got to we got to help this service go along a little bit better Hallelujah cuz I think sometimes we just come to church and it's just another Thursday night and and you know and we're going to uhh sit back and listen for the word no I want a little bit more out of you tonight is our God good I said is the Lord good has God been good to you is God worthy so we ought to be able to say Amen to the [Applause] word yes sir we come to church like we've never heard gospel preaching before and we sit there so-called Discerning no you become a hindrance what do you deserve hallelujah how many times have I been here amen you should be on the front line saiding come on brother DS pre I'm like Paul I ain't got no heresies I might be a maniac and that's the way I worship Hallelujah but I love [Applause] God do we come here to see God I said do we come here to see God this ain't no insurance seminar I don't work for State Farm but I'm a vessel of God and I've come to be used I've come to get out the way and it's up to you to work this gift that is standing before you it's up to you to work this gift that is standing before you and the only way to bring God closer is to say is to say it's for you to [Applause] say hallelujah you know amen is a magnet for God to talk to your situation God cannot resist those words God cannot stand back Hallelujah when you begin to say Amen because amen means so be it Hall so when I'm preaching and you agree you say Amen that means you're amen and the word is being preached and when you say Amen that means be it unto me be it unto me according to what is being said Lord be it unto me Lord have your way and I say Amen to the word hallelujah hallelujah Church remember I said going back to that time when you made contact Hallelujah when we first made contact we didn't have a problem with saying amen no that's right [Applause] we was ready to come to church we was ready for the word to start some of you was once on the front row and as soon as you heard God talking to you you said uhoh that one was a little too slow that was a little too slow some of y'all ain't with me yet Hallelujah some of you are a little too slow Hallelujah Church think about it Hallelujah if God I I I said this other night how the prophet of God he will say and I love saying this because I believe it doesn't just apply to brother brandham amen he said Hey what if I was to tell you he was talking about the reaction of the people and the faith of the people and he made this statement he said what if I was to say God was up there preaching in the [Applause] suit oh my oh my what if God he said what if God was up there sitting in that suit in this suit preaching to you H sir Church what was he really saying he was really saying it's God in Me preaching to you so it really is God up here in the suit talking to you and you're feeling stimulation for Revelation that ain't me doing that that's the quicking power that lies within your seed woo [Applause] W and if that seed ever comes in contact with something that can germatize it it will make it say [Music] Amen oh my so church as my car got hit everybody all right my car got hit and then I begin to talk about her and all these things I begin to think amen at that point of contact there were all kind of spirits present amen there were all kind of there could have been spirits of anger Hallelujah cuz all kind of things were happening now her the her supervisor comes out and he he comes up to the to my car and all these things and he says what happened and I tell him and he said yeah that's exactly what she said but that wasn't what was on my mind after I talked to her I had a flight to catch right Hallelujah I had a flight to catch and I had about an hour and 15 minutes to get inside and get checked in and all these things and get back to the back Hallelujah and this man was taking his sweet time and there was a spirit saying he need to hurry up you got to get out of here you need to make him hurry up I don't get religious on me now you know how you talk when you trying to get to work and you make maybe a little bit late and that person gets in front of you who don't got a care in the world and there's something inside you saying I wish you get out the way and it starts with a horn get out what is that that's a spirit making contact with you oh oh my oh my you already late so what's going to happen if you just get there late you already late you can't make up the time Hallelujah so you might as well sit in the car and pray about the situation instead of getting all aggravated because you know what's going to happen after you horn that person and that person get out the way because there's a spirit on you and Satan wants to feed that Spirit he'll put somebody else in front of [Applause] you what's happening you've made contact with the wrong spirit [Music] but one of you driving Hallelujah and this person gets in front of you and they're driving crazy or driving slow and you say help them Lord then a spirit of peace comes over you and no matter what happens you've made contact with something that'll keep you calm and you never know Hallelujah that spirit that may have wanted to rush you Hallelujah maybe five miles down the road before you got to your turn there was an accident but you made contact with the right spirit that kept you come so you wasn't in a hurry so what happened you missed your [Applause] accident you can't tell me God don't work like that sometimes he keeps you calm for your own [Applause] good because Satan has traps he has things he set up for us [Music] hallelujah but if you get under the wrong Spirit Hallelujah you'll make contact with the things that Satan has out there for you oh my and you know church as I as as as a the man he says he wrote down information this and that he says now I got to call the police I said call the police see in my state when something happens on private grounds there's no ticket giving out they just write it up and change contact and you be gone he says no I got to call the police now I'm like oh my God that spirit is still trying to get on me I didn't pass this test but he's still lingering church let me tell you something Satan is a buzzard and he's always lingering he's always circling yeah you came through that battle but he's still circling Hallelujah you apologize to that sister but he's still circling circling Hall you and that brother made it right but he's still circling why because he's a [Applause] buzzer Eagles don't Circle they attack Hallelujah see you only Circle when it's dead Hallelujah have to make sure it's dead but an ego wants something that's alive it has to be moving it has to be jiggling and doing something that way that Eagle attacks he attacks something that's alive Hallelujah but Satan is AB bosard so he's always circling what is he doing he's studying the situation that's good and the enemy knows if you truly haven't forgiven that person yet that's so good oh oh oh oh so he'll allow another situation to arise because you've made contact with unforgiveness oh it's too late now of blood loose and you thought this was going to be a regular night no God wants you to forgive Hallelujah you've come here time and time again with hatred in that in your heart for that person but now it's time to let that go it's time to let it go it's time to let it go it's time to let it go and once you let it go you will feel better Hallelujah that's the reason why people come to church and it's so hard for the spirit to move because there are other Spirits making contact even right now where I'm preaching there's a spirit trying to contact you either it's God or it's the [Applause] devil sir Hallelujah and I can tell by the grace of God who's contacting you by the way you respond to the word right yes sir here we go here we go y that certainly doesn't look like a person who's made contact with [Applause] God you say brother you trying to excite the people no think about it contact with God he who knows all he who holds the world in his hand he who's the auor of joy peace Hallelujah he Hallelujah who knows everything he who omnicient has all the power in his hand if you make contact with [Music] that if you make contact with that kind of God how could you ever hold your peace he said if you don't worship me the rocks are Crow this is what the prophet of God says he says hey now we worshiped Hallelujah we had a good song service but what good is that if we don't make a contact with God we sung some good songs some songs that we love and you know and we worship and everything but what good is that if the Fire doesn't come down on our Altar and consume our sacrifice oh that [Applause] everybody all right so the man police officer comes he says hey what happened I told him he says okay I got to see what she said I said hey how long this going to take I got to catch a flight let me back up a little bit her supervisor when I asked him I said hey I got about an hour to get to my flight somebody going to give me another ticket he said oh no uhuh that ain't got nothing to do with us y'all can imagine what was going through my mind I'm in Charlotte Airport I got hit by a Charlotte bus transportation I paid my money Hallelujah to the Charlotte Airport and now you're going to tell me that what I'm being hindered up by is not accountable oh my that that that that sounds like a person sitting in church who hasn't been filled with the holy spirit yet they never want to be accountable they never want to hold themselves accountable it's everybody else's fault it's the way brother Diggs preaches Brother Sam didn't say this right in counseling he took my wife side or he took my husband's side he took the children's it ain't nobody else fault hallelujah it's always somebody else's fault it ain't never my fault I ain't did nothing wrong I ain't the reason why we going through [Applause] this church if you haven't realized tonight God is trying to break the chains off of somebody's life God is trying to deliver you from a spirit that's made contact with you and we're not strangers to that taking place in this church Hallelujah we've seen demons cast out in this church we've seen smoking demons be cast out Hallelujah in this church we've seen alcohol demons cast out in this church we've seen religious demons cast out in this church so we have already made contact with a real God hallah and I don't know about you when I come here I expect nothing but the same thing Hallelujah Hallelujah Lord leave all your problems at home and here is the hour of uh celebration and deliverance Hallelujah in here the things of God are more relevant hallelujah amen Satan belongs under our feet so anyway the police officer he comes and I says hey I got to catch a flight and you know like I say back to this other guy the other guy oh no we can't help you I'm like what I just got hit by your bus and I got a flight in your airport oh no we can't can't help you you know I I'm just telling you what I can do sometimes God will put us in situations where we have no control hallah no doubt some of you are in those situations right now you're in a situation that you can't control Hallelujah maybe it's with your family or maybe it's with your job or maybe it's with your pastor it's amazing to me people come to church and think they can control the shepherd no he's here for your benefit Hallelujah he's here to help see you through and the day you realize that the better off you'll be and and I'll say this if he's not the one that you see leading you you're in the wrong church amen don't stay here and be a problem go someplace else and get help Hallelujah because if you stay here and be a problem to him you're a problem to me you're a problem to to him and to her and to him and to her and to everybody else that sees him as Shepherd you become a problem to all of us and you wonder why people looking at you strange can't yes sir brother Samuel we into some stuff tonight but I want you to understand something holah I'm not being arrogant and I'm not being rude but the scripture says whom God loves loes he rebuking Jason whom God loves he will correct Hallelujah so church if I'm stepping on your foot Hallelujah if I'm on your toes tonight and I ain't one of them preachers who walk light I like my shoes to make some noise Hallelujah if I'm stumping on your toes tonight Hallelujah let's just understand something it's the grace of God if God comes and reminds you of your life and reminds you of your error and the things you doing wrong or even reminding you of your personality while the word is being [Applause] [Music] preached because that's what we try to do y'all know that there's a rumor in the message there's a rumor it travels from from from it's all the way down in the South it travels all the way in the north the West the East all over the place there's a rumor that goes out and it's it's been circling as long as I've been in the message as long as I've been in the word a rumor and some of you have heard it but some of you have have succumbed to the rumor but if it's a rumor that mean it ain't true amen there's a rumor that travel the world it's it's all over the world in the message h and the rumor is white people don't shout hallelujah oh y'all thought I was going to say something deep you thought going to say something deep you thought I was going to say something deep no it's a rumor it's a rumor that white people don't Rejoice white people don't Amen in the word white people don't stand on their feet white people don't give God thanks why people don't shout hallelujah now I want to know if that's just a rumor now I don't know about you but I didn't seen this one get down I didn't seen him get down before Hallelujah I didn't seen them get down before Hallelujah I didn't see them shout I didn't see them Dan it's too late you got some in here already that believe in shout I didn't see him worship but you ain't white [Music] Satan been lying all through Ohio Hallelujah but today that Li has been exposed it's been exposed that lies came down what it

matter where you come from Hallelujah when it because of the things of God we're built to [Applause] Rejoice amen hallelujah Hall so you been lying and some of you fail to the LIE come to church with your old quiet personality oh boy oh boy you mean to tell me I've been preaching 45 minutes hard and you ain't move one time you know what I call that I call that mannequin worship you ever look in the store and see a mannequin you walk by an hour later it's still in the same position you walk down the road it's raining it's still in the same position the wind is blowing hard it's snowing right it's below 40 it has no life it has no emotion and the proph of God say anything without emotion is dead and you need to bury it Oh Brother D is trying to excite the people would you rather me EXC F you or put you to sleep there's a rumor hallelujah amen there's another rumor Hallelujah about black people here we go and they say oh we just a bunch of radical Pentecostals there's a little bit of Truth to that one Hallelujah radical yes but not by Pentecost denomination by Pentecost Revelation hallelujah hallelujah amen amen and some of you fit into my church Hallelujah I feel like I'm at home because this ain't about color it's about Revelation Hallelujah it's about Revelation since we hitting the rumors they say Hispanics are emotional on brother this is the question emotional about what Hallelujah because everybody so afraid of emotion and they'll say oh this this is that's too radical and this is that and this is that and the prophet of God says he says when the Holy Spirit comes it brings an emotion he didn't say it was emotion he say it brings an emotion what happens is something that stands you up on your feet and say Amen to God Amen to God Lord I love you Lord I Thank you Lord you've been good to me and if you want to get mad at my emotion because I'm grateful I'm sorry Glory Hallelujah remember the spirit is neither Jew nor Gentile so it's not black it's not white

some just pie the word don't worry about what I'm doing just pie the word you know what I tell people I tell people I say he you ought to try it sometimes you ought to try just standing up and saying amen am you ought to try sometimes just in your seat raise both of your hands and say hallelujah you might say bro D but then I'll be manufactured nothing I'll be manufacturing something that's if you try to make it something Hallelujah but if you just comes and just say hey Lord you're worthy Lord You're wor you're worthy of a Hallelujah Lord you're worthy of a thank you Jesus Lord I'm not going to add anything else to it I'm just going to give it to you Lord I'm going to give you my Hallelujah yes sir you ought to tried sometimes it's very liberating it and you you may be a little too

that's right sir oh my I did something I never did in church before I gave the preacher a high five and I smiled when it happened hallelujah praise the Lord amen amen you say what is this all about the prophet of God says when you're looking for a certain thing in church you have to create that kind of atmosphere right right that's a good one and we're creating an atmosphere of Faith an atmosphere of Liberty an atmosphere of Joy where we can make contact with the attributes of God hallelujah now if you have a need in this place Hallelujah if you make a contact with God he's obligated to touch that [Applause] need sickness in your body Hallelujah make contact with Jehovah Rafa Hallelujah Church the man says everybody all right yes sir can't see the clock got a glare on it Church

abundantly above you asking for and I was like Lord just help me to make it to the plane on time please God and I'm gone I get there they loading the plane church I got on the plane and God is so

there God let it sit there a little bit longer just to make sure Kayla I sit down and get [Applause] cable church I'm about to close how many believe it church 1st Samuel chapter 30 everybody all right 1st Samuel 30 while we notice the story when David came back Hallelujah and the Bible says let's let's let's let's just start at verse five it says and David's two wives were taken cap did a h and the jite and Abigail the wife of nabal the camelite and David was greatly distressed look Church the first thing that tried to get on David he was very distressed in his moment his wife was gone his children were gone his sons and daughters were gone and his captains his soldiers their children were gone but church sometimes we got to remember we got to go back we have to reflect on what God has done but look church when we go back and read we go up a little bit the Bible says uh in in in verse two it says it had taken the women and C the women captive and were therein they slew not any either great or small but carried them away and went on their way see sometimes when situations happen we overreact and ain't nobody been hurt the Bible says the women were taken captive the children were gone and there was nobody hurt and the people hallelujah we follow this on down Hallelujah the Bible says that David was grieved why because the people thought of stoning him anger was there grief was there oh my church let's keep reading and David was greatly distressed for the people spake of stoning him because the soul of the people was very was was grieved oh my now there's a spir a spirit of grieving there they were angry they were distressed and they were grieved over what the Bible said nobody was harmed nobody was hurt wow but what begin to happen their imagination begin to forerun the situation that's right there you go their imagination begin to make contact with something that never took place and how often our imagination gives us a scenario of what could be that never took place [Applause] why not let your imagination create something that's good for you instead of creating something that's bad for you Hallelujah and immediately in those moments Hallelujah their imagination thought about Hallelujah distress and grief oh my they were angry they were distressed they were grieved and they wanted to Stone David why because they were thinking of her hurt and pain but it already said nobody was hurt how often do we create scenarios that are not real we make contact we make contact in the spirit world with something that doesn't belong to you we make contact with spirits of unbelief because our imagination is creating a scenario right do me a favor brother turn that air down it's kind breathing on me look let's keep reading I'm g go over this again he says and David was very distressed for the people spake of stoning him because the soul of the people was grieved every man for his son and for his daughter but look in the midst of all that going on David begin to remember Hall and the Bible says and David encouraged himself so good he begin to overcome the grief he begin to overcome the anger and the distress and all the atmosphere that the people were creating by remembering the hand of the Lord and the Bible says David begin to encourage himself how did he encourage himself I guarantee you he begin to go back to Goliath yes sir some of you need to go back to your Goliath and what God did to your Goliath when it looked like the situation was impossible God put your giant in your hand God put that problem in your hand you spoke to it and you destroyed it I guarantee you David went back to the bear when the bear took the Sheep Hallelujah and David encouraged himself I guarantee you David went back to the lion and the sheep and David encouraged [Applause] himself I guarantee you David went back to when the Ark of the Covenant was coming back into the camp Hallelujah and he encouraged [Applause] himself am oh my that's my alarm for y'all I was in South Africa preaching and the atmosphere was like this and his Spirit was so high just like this when it was over with I was like what happen to my long I was talking to the brother I said man I had a time set brother Brian I said I had a time set he said yeah while you was preaching it went off and I came up to it and cut it off while you was walking [Applause] around I hope ain't nobody cutting the switch off tonight it's somebody cutting the switch y there somebody want more of God tonight I'm about to get out the way Church in moments of distress be careful what you make contact with David Hallelujah the Bible says he encouraged himself when grief was there when anger was there Hallelujah when distress was there the Bible say David encouraged himself David begin to go back Hallelujah he's probably started thinking about the Mighty Men God gave him W he probably begin to think about the people he was worshiping with Hallelujah he started to think about the people he was worshiping with amen he probably was thinking about the people he was worshiping with cuz one day David went out to fight Hallelujah Goliath the children of anak and one of Goliath Brothers had a new sword and he said I'mma kill David and the Bible says a Bishi came up behind him and and he said don't you ever come out here by yourself again David begin to encourage himself David begin to think about there's somebody in here that got my back somebody got my back tonight somebody's fighting with me tonight [Applause] thank you Lord next verse in the midst of all that next verse and David in quiet of the Lord that was his point of contact that's good that's so good it wasn't the distress no it wasn't the anger it wasn't the grief the Bible say David encouraged himself and then he inquired of God saying see he had such in a relationship with God David was like Lord what do I do do I pursue or not right knowing that whatever God says is going to happen that's the kind of people we should be let's inquire of God before we do things let's inquire of God before we believe Satan's lies and David inquired and the Lord saying shall I pursue after this troop shall I overtake them [Music] right see David wasn't going out there to play around sir he knew if he asked of God God was either going to tell him stay still or go and Conquer right that's right Hallelujah we ain't playing with the devil Hallelujah either you going to stay still or you going to go and Conquer Hallelujah in the name of the Lord and he said hallelujah amen he said shall I overtake them and he answered him pursue for thou shall surely overtake them and with the whe without fail recover all would that mean if God made that word to you tonight a reality what if God is saying to you pursue believe in me and I guarantee you you'll recover all Hall but first of all you got to inquire of God because there's a thing sometimes we ask God when we already know what we want to do right and then our intentions are not pure that's very good we say God oh lord lord should I marry this person you know Lord Lord should I just want your will but I really really want them you ain't being honest with God no sir that's what bam did Lord should I go all this people or should I stay but I really really want to go God said no don't go he go back he say I can't say what the Lord told me to say they say hey I give you some more money well I I don't know if God was sure let me go back and ask him again see he had them made contact with the wrong spirit and that thing was stronger than listening to the will of God that's right be careful for what you made contact with it'll overpower your decision I need to close church if we go back to Jacob in Genesis 32 is one of the first places where Jacob really got down and me business with God right all before then he was just using his gifts right that's I tricked myself out of this David was the first trick in the Bible David could trick I mean not David uh Jacob Jacob was the first trick he could trick you out of anything he hey hey you hungry you hungry just give me your birth right Daddy this is me Esau feel my arms chicken a everybody down to his father-in-law setting up the cattle making the big ones over the spider ones over here hey father-in-law I boy I got you some good ones over here tricking everybody trick trick trick that's right but then one day God told him I want you to go back home I want you to go back home and face everything you did one day you got the faceal s Hallelujah it wasn't so Esau he had to face he had to face himself all the stuff he did he had to face himself Hallelujah and now I'm I'm about to close don't get nervous and now he comes back he sends some gifts he send something to ease the welcome and send it down to Esau Esau send it back I don't need what you sending hallelujah hallelujah yeah I'm of ishmail side but we rich too Hallelujah he said hey send it back I don't need it and they send it back to Jacob they say Esau is coming with 400 men and he send your gifts back he don't need it job oh my God now look what is he afraid of in my closing he's making contact again with his past oh boy yes sir and it's his past where he come from all the things he all the things he've done and all the things he came up against and now he's looking at his past and his past still has a hold on him he's afraid of his past Esau is coming I did Esau wrong you know what he was you know what he was hearing church when he left all he could hear was Esau saying I'mma kill you right that's right he got the birth right and he riding he riding I'mma kill you oh you can hear I'mma kill you you ever been in the mountains and you say something in an echo as far as you can go that's probably how it was with Jacob he riding away Esau say I'mma kill you right and he couldn't get away from it as many times he said it it echoed I'mma kill you yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah now he's remembering he's thinking about his past and that fear is overcoming him again he's made contact with that past the only thing he can do now he's been quoting it all his life the god of My Father Abraham the god of my father Isaac now it has to become his God right that's right it's not just brother brenham's God it has to be your God it can't just be brother de's God it has to be your God it can't just be brother Samuel's God it has to be your God or any other preacher you might listen to it has to be your God hallelujah whatever you stand in need of tonight it has to be from your God and the Bible says Jacob he sends his wife this way C that way Hallelujah why did he separate the family because of fear fear his imagination is taking over the situation he said oh my Esau going to come and he can kill me and my whole family I'm going run a little bit further Esau didn't come to kill right that's right he didn't come to kill but Jacob Hallelujah he had to get to this place where he could meet God good that's part two to this message maybe another time but because of his past he can't escape it only thing he know how to do is call on the god of his fathers yes to be that same God for him and he get down on his knees and he starts to pray like never before he starts to cry and call out to God like never before until an angel appears before him wouldn't that be a blessing to you tonight if you would pray so earnestly Hallelujah so effectual and fervent that Angels would appear in the building tonight well let me tell you something Church they're already here you just can't see it with your natural eye ministering Spirits are already here tonight will to touch you Hall if you would just say amen hallelujah hallelujah church and he prayed and he prayed and the angel came and and Jacob just he he didn't just stand back and say wow this has never happened to me before but he grabbed hold of it he grabbed hold of and he wrestled with it and wrestled with it angel trying to get loose wrestle with it wrestle with it trying get loose rle with it rle with it the Bible says that he prevailed against [Applause] God does y'all bible say that my Bible say he Prevail over God he wrestled with God so much did the angel say hey turn me loose the daylight is coming Jacob said no not until you bless me the angel had to touch him on his thigh Hallelujah that was the only way Jacob was going to lose grip oh my that's so good oh oh my would you want to get a hold on God so much till he change your walk hallelujah hallelujah wouldn't you want to get a hold on God so much to he change your approach Hallelujah wouldn't you want to get a hold of God so much till he change your name change your name to match your [Applause] future that's what he did for Jacob he changed his name from Suppa and CER to Israel Prince with God amen hallelujah he changed his name to match his future and so did God do for us I no longer call you church but I call you bride bride means that you are a wife hallu Hallelujah GL Hallelujah you've been picked out by God you've been serenate by God you've been destined to go into the bed chamber hallu and when Jacob rose up he was different come on musicians I'm closing he was different he walked with a limp and everybody could see there was something different about him he had what what happened it was the point of contact right he didn't come to church the same anymore and now he has a testimony that on people ask him what happened to your thigh he goes back and he say that's when God touched me see he could encourage himself just like David by that touch on his thigh BR what are you saying everybody in this room should have an experience that you can go back to and say that's when God touched me that's when I was changed and from that point I was never the same everybody should have that kind of contact and if you don't what hinders you the holy spirit is here [Applause] tonight the holy spirit is here tonight to make contact amen you might have come said I'm do my religious Duty you know I supposed to be to church on Thursday night but tonight God wants to make contact amen but do you or are you still going to jump out of the way cuz you don't want to be changed remember there are two things about a contact you can get into an accident and not be affected by it cuz there's sometimes you get in an accident offender bender and you're like oh man I just get my car fix that what happened to me it didn't affect me personally it affected my car but don't you know you can get in an accident that you will remember for the rest of your life oh yes oh yes because it may hurt your back and every time you try to lift something you like oh man then somebody ask you what happened

the water's troubled it's a time it's a moment to really step in I tell you right now I I wouldn't even worry about time I wouldn't worry about time the needs that we have are greater than the time the situations and things that God has personally come down here tonight and called out brother Cadre don't know but God knows God knows our hearts yes Lord and when God makes those things known you know what he's trying to do just like when he came down in the garden he said Adam Adam we're out there God knew where Adam was hiding behind he could have went right to the bush but God by his voice comes down and calls to us to try to draw us out I tell you just as much as it could move in your heart when you hear him speaking at first there's a fear that could want to come to hold you back on it but let me tell you that's not the right Spirit you want to y to the spirit who's unfolding and making known that Spirit that's one to try to keep you back the spirit of God does not give us excuses he gives us reasons for Liberty that's right that's what we want more than anything else is Liberty all the way I tell you tonight if there's something anything that's unresolved tonight it would ought to be like the night like when Moses stood there and said whoever is on the Lord's Side let him come stand by me Moses represented the word and if there's anything that's unresolved tonight let me tell you something looking even around this room visible but even in the invisible there is a host that's saying that is saying press on Amen Hallelujah I'm for anybody that's willing to admit their wrong and get right with God I'm willing for anybody that's ready to take God at their word amen hallelujah let's leave out of here with full victory tonight don't let nothing hold you back Hallelujah I'm going to turn up my praise and I'll drown out the down holding my shield of faith and I feel no alarm Lord Jesus that's when the enemy comes comes like a blood I'm going going to raise up my standard and I'll over going to turn up my PR I'm going to turn up my praise and I TR out the down holding my Shi the face and I feel no alarm that's when the eny comes when he comes in like of BL I'm going to raise up my standard and overcome well the devil can you hear me this a lot is for you you see you have no power over what I go through oh Victory may be in Jesus Jesus lives in me you so I'm going to turn of my praise and I'll show you what my faith I'm going to turn up my praise and I'll shout out the down holding my Shi of Faith oh God and I feel no alarm that's when the enemy comes yes he does like f I'm going to raise my standard [Music] [Applause] and amen I'm going to let you be dismissed anybody that you feel to go remember the last statement you think of balum of what happened with balum and I we've seen this that the longer if there's something you put off the stronger and the harder it gets true the longer you put anything off the stronger that Spirit gets yes it does it just keeps pushing it and pushing it and pushing it and pushing it it's a time don't don't don't make excuses I just I feel in my heart before they started to sing that even again as we went into that thought about that with balum don't don't put anything off but the same you trying to pull any I'm not trying to pull on anybody if the word don't move you nothing will and I say that with love in my heart CU not an emotion it's not a string on a piano it's not an organ that'll move you it's not your favorite song if that's all it is then that's what it's going to take every day of your life is a certain key a certain song a certain preacher a certain feeling that's not what moves us if the word of God doesn't move us then we're unmovable but it ought to be the word of God that's drawing and moving and Upon Our Hearts and the greatest compliment we can do is take a stand upon that word sometimes God requires us to move move out from where we're at because if not it becomes harder and it becomes stronger right brother Samuel have you seen that I've seen it I've watched where those spirits will build and build and build and build and it takes one step of Faith to break that hold you watch the Liberty that will come amen I know that's the truth and I know God has spoken here tonight I tell you what for any heart or any life if you leave out and you're not free it's not God God's fault God has spoken tonight he has spoken tonight amen God has spoken amen hallelujah so we'll let you be dismissed those of you that would like to stay in worship I'm just I
