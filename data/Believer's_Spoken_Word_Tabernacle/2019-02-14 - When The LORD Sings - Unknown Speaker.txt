precious what God has done and what the Lord is doing is such a precious precious reality to recognize that you know the song that we're so familiar with the anchor holds and we see that it's a reality there is something greater than our ability that's holding us it's a truth it's it's a great reality of what God has done and is doing in our lives hey you mister karma it's good to see you tonight sister god bless you that's that's an answer to prayer right there amen god bless you it's real good to see you tonight and your deceit and every one of you amen we want to turn our attention to the word of the Lord tonight and just ask that God will just come and just take control in the service here tonight and just speak to our heart we all have needs we all have needs and you know as much as we could try to when we would hear a need to try to speak to it and yet if it's not under his unction and direction even our greatest attempts would be futile but all it takes is his presence all it takes is him coming by and there is things that are able to open and answers to come that even that we and ourselves would not have even thought or even put together but in his presence he opens and he makes known his way and just to always remember he never slumbers or sleeps he knows exactly all of our needs and for us as believers this is not just a phrase this is a reality amen let's just stand and we'll look right into the word of the Lord we want to go right to Exodus 15 and I want to read just a little bit from there tonight Exodus 15 and would just read a few verses of Scripture here to begin with verse 1 then saying Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the Lord and spake saying I will sing unto the Lord for he hath triumphed gloriously the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea the Lord is my strength and song and he has become my salvation he is my god and I will prepare him and habitation my father's God and I will exalt him the Lord is a man of war the Lord is his name Amen let's just bow our heads if we could together and let's just pray just one for another and just that God will just come and speak to us tonight Lord Jesus as we Lord are just Lord so thankful in our hearts that you have given us Lord an opportunity Lord to be here in the house of the Lord your God as I think Lord I look over the congregation Lord I see sister

the unction of the Holy Ghost tonight Lord father we ask it Lord made us sick be healed tonight Lord God Father Lord may Satan's hold if there be any may it be dismantled tonight or God and may the Holy Ghost just Lord move among us freely Lord in a real personal way tonight we pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen god bless yous your being seated I'm gonna ask you tonight if you'll just kind of bear with me here we you know when you get to looking at something I am eight tonight just kind of run in the looking at things that are laying prophetic in the scripture and you find that things that here with in Exodus 15 fifteen that were actually smoking that were part of the prophecy don't worry I've got that my great that was given even concerning of Israel coming coming into their position into the land even now and you find that there are men there are other parts that were even typed and spoken here even of in Exodus 15 but you know I want to look at at the part that here you find in the book in this first stage of the journey and that of Exodus of how that God has brought Israel and he has taken care of of their enemies and we look at a song like last week we looked at that particular phrase the Lord is my strength and my song and that very thing is that he's not just a part of the song he is the song he is the melody and that's the very word he's the melody he's the heart he's the theme it's not it's not something within this song that you have to wonder who are we talking about it's very clear he's the he's the song he's the melody of our lives and when you think of it you know you look at songs when songs are being sung you know you come in to a service and we know that within a service you know the songs itself it goes before the battle and we can see many times you walk into a service and how that the songs and I believe that we need the leadership of the Holy Spirit in every part of the service it's things that not just among the song leader but we need it among the congregation and I believe that that that's something that we welcome and we recognize that their God his desire is that we would worship Him in spirit and in truth and to recognize that we each have a great participating role and it isn't so much so that you know that maybe you don't have as you would think maybe the greatest voice or maybe your voice isn't it or or what-have-you but it is where that you yourself are coming in and you are blending and giving your all with what's going on you may not be in as I said maybe having the strength to sing and it may be that maybe some songs or so forth and a new song is introduced but yet even as that would come along you us when we come in here we look for one purpose we're here to worship the Lord even the songs of Zion that are sung we're here to come into that place and say as we singing it and Lord just making it real to me and entering into those songs and we realized that this is not a show this is not anything that's a put-on and we're not interested I'll say it like this I believe that even when you look at musicians and everything else we want to do our very best unto the Lord but to remember that you know it's always important it's just like when you're singing we're not here that we hit every note just right because when we get worried on that we're worried about ourselves we're not worried that we get everything else right what we are worried and what we're not worried but what we're focused on is is we want to follow the unction of the Holy Spirit sometimes you come into a service and there's what you don't realize is that there's all types of spirits that's battling because if the enemy can get things thrown off from the very beginning then what he looks at is that our focus would be upon that and then it prevents what he knows God is going to do because you see Satan himself cannot stop what the man of God under inspiration is receiving from God and Satan has enough to know that when that inspiration is coming and that where he can look over you know the shoulder and so forth and see it as you're studying knows the things I'm putting down and everything else and he recognizes that if this word if it's having its free course it's gonna bring deliverance in lives it's gonna bring help so Satan will try to do everything he can to try to hinder that or to try to dismantle it but it's this is where that we as people of God and maybe you know tonight as I speak maybe two more mature Christians and things in this manner to heckle this that within all of our hearts let us recognize that when there are tough times that come up when there's things that we're notes aren't hitting just right let's have that heart of a comfort and an understanding and say I'm gonna get right in there and I'm gonna just blend right in with this I'm gonna pull right on I'm not going to say why didn't you hit the right note why didn't you do this right why I'm just following him now why didn't you do this right but you see we can look around but remember here it's not us hitting the right note of singing the right note that is perfection perfection is him the perfect one coming in our myths and him ministering to our lives so what that means is sometimes it's for us to wear that we have to come in and in order to be a part of the service we've got to be willing to give ourselves there's times where you know you you might look at something to wear that how a service or maybe how songs and how God has directed you know the song leader and so forth even those who sing specials to to have a burden you know to sing a song and you know when you come in it's always a choice that you can you know maybe you don't feel like you know it worshipping it's just something that you just seem like that man I mean you know you're down you're discouraged it seems like everything that's been against you now I've been there I know I know what that's like as well where you don't feel like that but yet in the midst of that time there's something that within you to recognize that if you can just yield and override that that you know that just like what God did for Paul and Silas it wasn't that the situation became more comfortable it's that they themselves begin to embrace and they begin to worship God now you know when we read the scriptures brother ray we don't know how that all started out we know brother Ram talks about maybe that you know he said it was just like a foot tap or whatever more but what you don't know is here's what started that all out maybe it was just something where Paul would look at Silas and say ain't God good we don't know but we know something itself had to be a source to ignite it now you know the way I look this and I think God helped me that even when I don't feel like it that if there is something that is rough that is taking place help me Lord God not to pull back but help me to move right in their shoulder the burden that if it's hard for somebody lifting it like if we were lifting this piano and I see somebody struggling I want to move right into that place and pick that up because I know there is a part within that for me and and I believe that when we look at with Paul and Silas look what happened you see they were able to move beyond their afflictions and to think about the clothing stuck to their back you know how it is when you got a cut on your arm a cut on your knee or a cut and you let fabric dry in there that's not comfortable but to think about it they press beyond the unpleasant and uncomfortable circumstances why did they do that because he was worthy you see that was the testimony he was the song of their life and it invited the Lord the presence of God came on the scene so when you look at it when you come into a song service and I just used as the example the Lord would give me you know you come into it and we come as the Bible says I believe in Acts chapter 2 verse 1 it's a phrase that's used in the book of Acts a few times there and it's called one Accord it's not always the same word that's used throughout the New Testament but it's a word that begins with an H or ill you know a million dollar word there Hamas Satan or something like that but what it deals with is hound that there are many notes and yet those notes themselves surrendered and brought together then they they come together in an harmony and you know you're a note I'm a note every one of us and it depends on do we want to withhold our note or let our note blend with the rest of the music and you see that's how it is within a song service of how that we come in and we've got a decision to make are we going to blend in with worship now the devil will always fight you on the way to church he'll fight you throughout the week he'll fight you the devil even when you get here he'll fight you he'll try to get your mind all the things even while the word is going forth he'll try to fight you on it but this is that you have to say no my note belongs to the Lord it's here on this music sheet and I surrender it with the Lord like we said last week you and I we may not know exactly what's going on in the service and we look at it and it seems like my you know maybe my needs not even being addressed and maybe you do not have what would be like a need that you've really put out there but you've come to worship God you've come knowing that the Lord is mindful of your life but it might be a time in our life that we stand here and we say you know what I'm just going to pull on the gift of God because I know that there are needs within this assembly so right now even though that this might not be the strain or the Avenue over exactly where I'm living but still I've been there and I know that God is speaking and there's needs that's here tonight and this whole service is not just about me it is about the body of Jesus Christ the family of job and I'm a part of so I'm gonna lend my note I'm gonna yield myself and allow the Spirit of God to bring the melody from this service and bring victory to the people of God so when you look at this it takes it really takes the work of the Lord you know brother Carlos he'll never override you he'll never ride your brother Adam he'll never come brother bill say give me your note he wants our notes of our lives surrendered to him so God will work and so prepare a service to where that he is ministering not to bring all to us but he will bring it in such a manner to where you and I it's undeniable that God has been in our midst it will require something out of us for you and I to be able to yield and give of our lives but as we yield all we have to do is yield you and I cannot make it happen all we can do is yield but when we yield to him then think of it it is like a channel of faith a faith bank that is building within the building and the Spirit of God is moving to bring deliverance to bring you know to bring all the answers and to what questions or needs that's in our meeting here tonight and I look at this within the thought line and I think of how that God would deal with when we look at the faithfulness of the Lord God is faithful can you say amen to that he is faithful no matter what it is that we are facing or have faith he is faithful and I want to look at this tonight and examine the faithfulness of the Lord in bringing Zion Israel back to her homeland because remember Israel she is a Titan the Israel in the natural is a type of spiritual spirit spiritual Zion that of the bride of Jesus Christ and then you have that of natural Zion natural Israel and I want you to look at this here as we're looking in Exodus you find this was a time not of where that they were a sad but this was a time of victory but I want to remind you of something when they were standing on the shore here in Exodus 15 moments before this they thought their lives were going to be overtaken it they thought they were going to be snuffed out by the armies of the beasts but you see here God used that and aligned all that up it was nothing but an ambush - a lure Pharaoh and his army - a time of defeat and so when you look at it this was a time of rejoicing you know sometimes in our lives there is a song that may not be within maybe a certain tempo it might be a slower song but don't hang on there just have faith in the God because the Lord will turn you're farther along into I'll fly away are you with me now he knows exactly when to change the temple and the time because every song has high notes and low notes yours your life has high notes and low notes you can't play only low notes a piano it has high and low amid all of those work together to bring the beauty of the music and our tests and our trials they work together with the victories with everything in our life to bring forth the glory of Almighty God now I want to look at this tonight here and I want to speak the thought when the Lord sings when the Lord sings you know you got a choice when singing is going on if you're going to enter into that song or not Isaiah 62 verse 1 for Zions sake I will not hold my peace and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest until the righteousness thereof go forth has a brightness and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burnin and the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness and all the kings that glory and thou shalt be called by a new name which the mouth of the Lord shall name thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the Lord and a royal diadem in the hand of God thou shall no more be termed forsaken neither shall that land anymore be turned desolate but thou shalt be called hepzibah and I'll and Beulah for the Lord the lightest in thee and thy land shall be married you see God's desire is that the land would be very not just to have the word but that there would be those who are ordained in that word have their place in the world that we would be Mary for what so that the very richness of the land might yield her strength in manifestation in our lives because remember we're talking not just about Israel but we're talking about our lives as well just so to think about this I want you to notice the words the Lord Himself is bringing this about it's God himself that's bringing it about and he will not rest until his word is fulfilled he's faithful now to think of this the name will be changed to reflect the change in Israel to recognize that even the changing of the name reflects the change even within our lives there is things that God can see even in the depths of our life to where when our name has been changed when we have taken upon his name it's a reflection of what he did and that we are a part of that and part of that family so to see how that even their land will no longer be termed Forsaken and desolate think about this they were out there out of where the promises to think of how Israel was out of where the promises when they were down in Egypt but God had to bring them out of Egypt and get him into the land in order for the Messiah to be made manifest among them he couldn't happen everything itself had to be lined up here it's the same thing for you and I the Prophet asks the question in a third Exodus he said God gave the Holy Ghost as the land for the people to dwell in and why are we out of the land you see God one of the people his desire that there is a people that are married in that land they are united in that word to what their inheritance lays within that land now I want you to think about this here he goes on to saying this in the scripture they shall be called my delight is in her that's what hepzibah that my delight is in her and not land is married you see God is in a time here of singing the elect of Israel gonna be united with the promises of God what's this for as a young man marries a virgin so shall thy sons marry thee and as a bridegroom rejoices over the bride so shall thy God rejoice over V what is he doing he is rejoicing over his work God's rejoicing now over his work we are his workmanship and when Israel has been brought forth there and then to see how God moves within Israel it's God rejoicing over her he said I've sent Watchmen upon thy walls o Jerusalem which shall hold their peace which shall never hold their peace they are not ye that make mention of the Lord keep not silent and give him no rest till he established until he make jerusalem a praise in the earth gallery I don't care who comes against it you cannot over throw it he will not rest many others break Pat's and everything else but remember he will not rest till he established and he make jerusalem a praise in the earth that goes clear into the millennium clear into the future hope he will not rest the elect sons think of this now the scripture said for as a young man marries a virgin so by sons so shall the sons marry thee think of it elect sons coming under the unction of the Holy Ghost I hope you're with me tonight you see for many that don't recognize even what is taking place there's thoughts there's all types of of things even among the Jewish people but to see the unction that is taking place where sons where there are many there's multitudes coming back but remember within the multitudes that are coming back there is an elect 144,000 within that whole bunch you see there there is that friends I'm telling you right now it is a problem throughout the earth where you see that the Jews themselves in one year alone thirty thousand going back to Israel there are all kinds of groups that are helping them and but the help of the Lord I'll get into that here in a little bit according to the scriptural prophecy and you see that the unction there of sons coming back and where the desire is is to come back to the land and God giving them a heart for the land a heart to return there a heart to leave their occupation and where they were grown up and born and to come back home I'm asking you who gave you a ransom to come home who put it in your heart to come home sometimes you look and you see a light word one gone here or gone there but let me tell you something you hold it before the throne of God and listen to me it has to be the Spirit of God sending the Holy Spirit out after him that he would bring an option that they returned back home that some shall marry thee throw repeater God spiritually Israel returning think about this in Zephaniah chapter three verse fourteen saying o daughter of Zion shout o Israel be glad and rejoice with all the heart o daughter of Jerusalem the LORD hath taken away thy judgments he hath cast out dine enemy the king of Israel even the Lord is in the midst of thee thou shalt not see evil anymore your glory better sister not just as this to natura Israel coming but this is the happening of what he himself has done in our life spiritually oh my he had taken away my judgments how he became our judgment he became our perpetuation glory be to God he cast out the enemy he didn't just escort him out remember there was a strong one that had a hold on our life but a stronger one came one stronger than him overtook him and spoil his Goods and threw him out of your life and he moves on the inside and that's why the testimony is greater is He that is in me than he that is in the world you see this is what happens when the Lord sings when he sings his presence falls Oh glory in that day it shall be said to Jerusalem fear thou not into zoos and design let not thy hands be slap the LORD thy God is in the midst of thee is mighty he's mighty the Lord who is in our midst he's mighty he's not puny he's not weak he's mighty the Ministry of Malachi for the ministry itself the prophetic ministry is to make known to you and I he is here for you with me it wasn't that after then God takes the Prophet off the scene listen friends it's not a prophetic ministry as far as what we were looking at in that hole that's got to continue on it's the same Holy Ghost it's the angel of the Lord that you and I had been brought into contact with the same Living God he did not diminish those heard he didn't diminish at all but we recognized him to be mighty he will save he will rejoice over thee with joy he will rest in his love he will joy over thee with singing bringing bringing prophecy together bringing the notes of our lives bringing and bringing it uniting it together it's caught himself in our midst the Lord Himself singing over us he's resting in his love this is how that he ministers to you and I in the rest is that it's not your works it's my rest look at this in verse 18 I will gather them that are sorrowful for the solemn assembly who are of thee to whom the reproach of it was a burden and that wonderful I will gather them now there's multitudes gathering but there are those who are part of those multitudes that he's bringing back there God knows who belongs to him then you're recognized here in Israel flooding back into the land in thousands in droves not to think of it has they're coming back into the land and how that the Spirit of God would be moving within this time I believe it's the Spirit of God with all my heart that is moving them back into the land now remember what the prophet has told us in the message invisible union of the Bride of Christ he said God cannot send a message until the people themselves desire to line up with the world he said and when their people desire to line with the word then God will send a message at that time I believe with all of my heart as the Lord is singing and he's drawing all of this back to Jerusalem just as he has drawn us and drawing every one of his children to him of the bride now I believe with all of my heart that the Spirit of God even as it is moving here among that of Israel there is a gathering that is taking place of the elect within that time I believe that with all my heart now notices here he goes on to say who are of thee to whom the reproach of it was a burden behold at that time I will undo all that afflict thee and I will save her that halted and gather her that was driven out notice I will I will it's God doing the gathering amen God has been the one gathering you know sometimes listen friends we look at things and we you know we should pray we ought to pray but remember it's not you and I that can make things happen if you set it over and over you can't save your children we are responsible to teach them that the presence of God would be manifested before that like Moses himself but people that shield renew the presence of God they knew the statutes the judgments they knew all of that but yet it took a greater one to come on the scene and bring them into the land and you know when we look at it that's what we have to recognize and realize that with each and every one that it takes God moving upon their heart it takes God gathering them if it's not God gathering them then it's just our own efforts but if we can look to the Lord you know what I mean sometimes you see different ones and maybe you ain't seen him for a while and all of a sudden you maybe you'll see them trickle back into church and you look at and say Lord is this you Lord God to know that friends they wouldn't be here unless there was something kneeling with their heart and then you look at and you say the Lord would you just continue Lord to move upon their life because you see God himself knows how to get a hold and bring his children unto himself he knows how to gather his children think about this what if your children come here and yet they could follow all the rules they could follow all the doctrine they could follow all that and yet they themselves were not born again would they be a help to the church in one way yes in another way no they would actually be a hindrance because within it they really do not see that they themselves must be lit on fire with the Holy Ghost that it's deeper than doctrines that it's deeper than following this that's deeper than all those things everything is necessary dress code holiness all those things but listen friends you can have all of that and without an experience you're lost you must have a new birth and experience with Almighty God and it takes God drawing upon the heart together his children unto him Oh glory be to God now watch this here that doesn't mean then we leave them alone it means we still witness we're friendly we reach out to him we encourage them we pray for right because remember here that he has no hands but our hands and blood Ram was quick to point out to us from the scripture if the salt has lost its Savior that how that salt itself cannot say unless it is brought in contact sometimes come in and contact with things that need saving that which is around it is very uncomfortable but remember it's the salt must be brought in contact to bring to savor come on somebody oh lord have mercy I don't want to fellowship with this I don't want to be with this I don't want to be polluted how about having confidence in the Holy Ghost in your life I'm not talking about going out and running with sinners and everything else but I'm saying it like this right here to recognize that it might be the very sounding of the shofar of your life that will actually get a hole of your family's life and to recognize and others within the Assembly the very presence of God in the mating from your life you need to recognize greater is He that is in me than he that's in the world look to God for his leadership don't trying to make it happen look to him for his leadership it doesn't matter how many have looked at these scriptures these prophecies but remember it's no man that can make this happen he said I will God will use men as instruments but he's the one doing the work that I was driven out and I will get them look at this I will get them praise and fame in every land where they have been put to shame at that time will I bring you again even in the time that I gather you for I will make you a name in a praise among all the people of the earth when I turn back your captivity before your eyes saith the Lord God's promise the veil is going to be lifted you realize there was a greater captivity than their captivity out there it's the captivity where the veil was over their heart because once the veil is removed then Liberty sounds right that's real true Liberty not just coming back to the land but the real true Liberty is where the veil is removed from their hearts now look at this in Zechariah chapter 12 verse 1 the burden of the word of the Lord for Israel saith the LORD which stretcheth forth the heavens and lay at the foundation of the earth and form a--the the spirit of man within him behold I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about when they shall be in the siege both against Judah and against Jerusalem who will make I will make God is in control and God is permitting and has permitted Israel but very nation to be a trembling cut to be something that you better just trying to maybe say the words just right because you know they're so interested in this peace agreement and this and and everything else God has allowed it and made it to be that way you find it even here in this nation where you have people now that have been elected into offices speaking out against Israel saying very very things that are in office very anti-semitic right against right against Israel then you have those even in the own party that are calling them out on it you know and standing upon those things you see there's such a dividing it's a trembling cup everybody's trying to be so politically balanced and and what do we do and and not tell you what frenzy you know what you can take it for how you want it but I'll just say like this we know that there had to be a certain character and caliber of a person we know it had to be God to come to a place to where that all these things even that embassy moving back to Jerusalem it could not have been upon a political puppet it could not have been somebody who was wishy-washy with a jellyfish backbone it could not have been somebody like that I'm not condoning we don't condone the man the character whatever more I'm not glorifying that I'm just telling you it could not have been anything else see the Spirit of God moving behind to bring that type of a decision in that time for a person who does not care what the rest of the world thinks Darren tell you some of the wishy-washys we've had would never have done that he said what brother Samuel it's the Spirit of God that's right but remember the Spirit of God even in this age keep in mind the Prophet said he fits the characteristic and makeup of the man out that age to catch the people of the age you see god himself knows how to so arrange those things if it's not for anything more other than our president that's an office right now it was to bring this very part around right here let me tell you something Cyrus was never a believer Cyrus was never known and recognized to be a believer but yet he was called my shepherd he was called mine anointed as a right this is what Cyrus was called it was not because that he was a believer it's because he would be an instrument a tool in the hand of God to recognize his commission Oh God if a man like that can be moved to recognize his commission what about you and I in this hour to recognize the commission of the Holy Ghost the word that would move upon our life hallelujah ho ho glory be to God I will make Jerusalem a trembling cup and in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome son for all people you know what that means the Spirit of Christ in you makes you a trembling cup to others it makes you burdensome they don't know where to place you they don't know how to classify you they want to know what organization do you belong to and when you do not pronounce one of the solidarity of names that are united together they do not know how to place you and then they look at you and they listen then they'll come around you and they say well don't judgment you said I ain't said a word to you you know what it is it's the conviction of the Holy Ghost by the standard in your life that actually brings conviction in their life it isn't you as a person but it's a very presence of Almighty God it's the law singing prayers over you it is his presence there where the Lord is bringing for joy and it brings conviction to them they don't even know why they hate you and though some of us bringing stuff on ourselves I'm saying that what is not recognized is because of the standard of Christ within our lives if we act like smart alecks and we get treated bad Wayne's suffering for God we're suffering from our own mouths come on friends and in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people all that burden themselves with with it with it shall be cut to pieces though all the people of the earth be gathered together against us so here is speaking even that in a time of Armageddon now let's brake on over to verse 4 here in that day saith the Lord I will smite every horse with astonishment that's power beasts are power right and his rider with madness furious I who will do it I will and I will open my eyes upon the house of Judah and I will smite every horse of the people with blindness same God what he did to the student to the Syrians they were blind to that of Elijah and Elijah let him ride into Israel oh I got a preach a minute here you see the enemy when he comes upon our lives with tests and with trials what he doesn't realize it's a blindness he's being led right into an ambush he's been led right to a place for God himself to come on the scene her mother and sister are faith don't diminish our faith grow stronger our roots grow deeper our hearts magnify the Lord glory be to God God does that whoa look here now and the governors of Judah shall say in their heart the inhabitants of Jerusalem shall be my strength in the Lord of Hosts their God the governors the rulers the men who are in power this is what they shall say in their heart whose whispering to them the Lord the melody song is starting to be sung oh yeah no what's this here he's putting it into their heart think about this the Bible says that God had put into the heart of those 10 horns those 10 Kings he put it into their heart to give their Kingdom their kingdoms unto the Beast who did it dub did it the same God that did that that's the contrast to this here were God putting it into the hearts of the governors of Judah I'll stay with me now here the Lord is placing into the hearts to call for a regather enough of Israel who puts it in your hearts together together who's brought us together this is not an assembly of man come on somebody this is not Satan's synagogue this is an assembly that has been called by God himself making his word alive and real in our hearts you and I didn't even know that we were a part of this but you see God in this hour he's singing in that song and as the notes of that song you and I are a part of that music sheet and it strikes our heart and it begins to move in our life and then here we find ourselves gathering gathering and you know what we don't stop General Mills just way we don't stop gather we gather Thursday's we gather Sunday's we don't even stop gathering as a matter of fact even in the rapture we're gathering we're all getting together amen that comes up missing ones here and there what is it gathering you see we're part of the gathering unto Him glory be to God think of this here the burden there now I want you to watch this here how can we we look at this to think Israel a little a little small nation as it is but God would put in I just was you know looking at some things reading some different things the burden to pay for relocation and placement in the land by the governors of the land it would be like different ones that maybe we're away from here let's say maybe like sister Rita when you were down in Kentucky and here you know you're not able to come back and we say you know what we will send the money we will send the moving truck we will send everything all you need to do is come you would say thank you Lord right to see nothing this isn't just one person this is God putting this burden in the hearts of the governors to pay for them to relocate Oh glory be to God you see here this is the exact statement here that was taken the Jewish the politicians there they believe this is their words that the Jewish future is only within Jerusalem let me tell you something the bright future is in Christ the word this is our future this is our Jubilee we're not politicians but we are delegates of that new city and God has put in the hearts of the delegates to say let's get together let's get together let's get together verse 6 in that day will I make the governors of Judah look what he'll make a mess and heart of fire among the wood and like a torch of fire in a sheath you know what father is fires heat fire catches on revival flowers consuming fire sets things on fire you can have the wood here and have the fire but when you get them together the wood is what brings the kindling to the fire you see it's God putting it in the hearts of the governor see their music their notes they're yielding to God in the midst of this time think about it everything is against them everybody all around is against them but yet within the midst of it they are moved by the unction of the Holy Spirit do you realize there's two songs going on there's a song right now that God is bringing Israel back in we understand our song as well but to recognize that this whole earth itself is under a religious song even right now that is even a song that is against like Psalm 62 say they want to somehow say that they love him but they want to tear him down from his majesty you with me they want to destroy and take away the effects of the gospel of Jesus Christ they they hate him like a torch of fairness chief and they shall devour all the people round about on the right handed on the left and Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own place even in Jerusalem I'll tell you right now we know that God put it in the heart of the Zionists to come back there and for a language that was dead for a language to be resurrected for that language to come back again of the Jewish language for that - God - put it in the hearts of men and women to stand back there and say this language must come back I say who put it in the heart God put it in their hearts and here they stood there as honest you see it was notes of a song that they themselves were a part of they many of them they never lived lived he even see Israel becoming a nation but you see their lives were necessary stepping stones that even those that returned and when they occur Israel could be recognized as a nation there were those who in a head and they gave their lives by the burden of the Lord in their hearts and in those who gave their lives were driven back by the tender hand of Jehovah their lives given paved way for what we're seeing right now how about you and I there's been many that's paved the way for you and I to enjoy the blessing that we enjoyed tonight to enjoy the presence of God many that labor many that have given their life but you and I might enjoy and be able is here this melody in this hour oma may it be a ring in our hearts God let my life be so live to wear that I live to see Lord you're coming if not Lord let my life be a stepping-stone let it be that that will pave the way I say this is marvelous this is the Lord's doing it's a burning of the hearts to return back God's using the governors of Judah I don't know if I can pronounce this word sometimes I forget words but the Jewish people who make their how'd you say alia Alia their holiday ah means to emigrate to come home you see they're not just leaving a country there's a difference between emigrate and emigrate emigrate focuses on the foreign country you left emigrate means you're focusing on your home you're coming home say that say that word again run the rain alia this is immigrate to come back home we're not focused on where

our hearts and say come out of her my people and be gathered back unto me Amen girl repeated Radha Symphony striking up here it is the music sheet that's laid here all this time and now the original

the anti-semitism the Muslims that are rising up against them but you see what all those tests and trials and persecutions is just to cause them to think about going home sometimes when there's things didn't pour it on your loved ones it's God letting things rise up so they start thinking about home [Applause] they begin to think that in my father's house the servants have it better oh lord have mercy I didn't in real time the Lord shall save verse 7 the tents of Judah first not the glory of the house of David and the glory of inhabitants of Jerusalem do not magnify themselves against Judah
