One more time. What a friend. Oh, a friendly Jesus. All our sins to bear. What a privilege to Oh, everything to God. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Pardon me as dealing with an update here and it's a little different for me. Um, I want to u just certainly want to say uh how we so appreciated the meetings this weekend &gt;&gt; and God was so good to us and just uh the word of the Lord was so uh so rich and &gt;&gt; you know there's many um areas sometimes that we God will have us to uh traverse through once again and come through and uh everything is always on time. Amen. With God. And God knows just what what what you and I what we have need of. And um we so thank so thank God for brother Trevor being here with us and just what a great blessing it was and great encouragement. Amen. And so um uh we also I want to uh remind you uh to continue to keep Sister Rachel in prayer as well. Sister Rachel Atkins. Um, I realized last week I called her sister Rachel Hannah. I'm glad brother Ryan didn't come through the phone and just my mind I I I but but everyone knew and but I am so thankful for how God's grace and bringing her through. Brother Ryan was just just texting me of how that um still a little dizzy and a little nausea. And so sometimes, you know, with the healing process, uh we don't know exactly how all of those things um are are to work out, but we know one thing that God is still in control. And and God is one as he's seen Peter all the way outside the city. He's the same God to see sister Rachel all the way through this. Amen. So, we want to just continue to hold her up in prayer uh just as diligently as we were when the requests were going out on the thread. And um also want to ask you to uh remember brother Jeremy Shriner and brother Danny Stemann in prayer. They um have arrived in India there yesterday and they're going to be there in uh India for about 12 days and ministering. So, we want to just remember remember them and um the Lord will just use them in a in a very great way to be a blessing to uh the bride in that part uh where where God would have them to minister. And also, I know you I think Paul said something about this coming weekend, just try to stay alert. So, um you know, uh sometimes when we've um I think it was last Thursday when we had to cancel, you know, I uh you I had to get out and do some things. Uh I was out on the roads and looking. I said, "Man, maybe I think we might have been able to pull through on this one, you know." But you you know, at the same time, I I know sometimes you get it right, sometimes you don't, and sometimes you wear on the side of caution, but what I was really concerned about because there were certain roads last week that when I started coming closer going north on 58, the roads were horrible. So, it just went from clear blacktop to where you had cars just pushed over. to my wife. I said it was just like something changed just like that going, you know, past Bob Evans, Chick-fil-A, and things like that. So, um, but anyhow, you know, we're we're thankful that God permitted that we could have service in the weekend. So, just be alert for that. Just be watching, you know, there on the phone. And, um, you know, we're not going to keep you guessing till 10:00 a.m. in the morning. We won't do that because just like uh Sister Stephanie and I see she's not here this evening but sister Stephanie is one she told me she said if you have any inclination let me know because she said I'm I'm leaving at about 6:30 in the morning on Sunday to make the way there because she she comes in here and she cleans and uh and uh so same thing on Thursday. So we'll try to be really on top of that and looking at it. Amen. Well, let's just stand and we'll just see how this how this runs here. So, let's um let's go here to Romans chapter 5, Brian. I don't know if I'm doing it correctly or not. um either screen mirroring. It's it just was a new update. So maybe in my um go back in my Benjamin, go back in my bag and on one of the cases you'll find my my mini and just bring that out to me. I didn't just do this, by the way. This was uh I've had this here before me, but um so Romans chapter 5 and just uh let's maybe have to bear with me here till we can get that out here and get that other part hooked up. Romans 5 and I want to read just five verse of scripture there. Uh therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of God. And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also, knowing that tribulation workketh patience, and patience experience, and experience hope, and hope maketh not ashamed, because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, which is given unto us. Amen. So, thank you. So, I want to maybe look here just tonight and I'd like to just speak on a thought on accumulation of godly confidence. So, let's just go to the Lord in a word of prayer tonight and let's just look to him. Our heavenly father, Lord, we are so thankful God for your mindfulness and your faithfulness, Lord, through every part of our lives, Lord. And we just, Lord, commit, Lord, every part of this service now into your hands. We thank you, Father, for just the the time, Lord, to gather and to worship, Lord. Oh, God, for our worship, Lord, it's it's not in vain. We are worshiping Lord with a thanksgiving from our heart for God the grace that you have God given to our lives and just to see what you are doing Lord and Father you're working in our lives oh God how we so thank you Lord even as we pour through Lord those Lord what you spoke to us this weekend Lord how we are so grateful Lord for your love and your care Lord we thank you father for every one of the gifts, Lord, that you have sent, Lord, to us. We need them, Lord. And we, Father, are so thankful, God, for your mercy. We ask that you would just be with the different needs, Lord. Sister Rachel, continue to give her strength in her body. I know Brother Rocco, Lord, still recovering, Lord, in his body. And, oh God, different needs, Lord, among us. May you just, Lord, minister to each one, God. May you give strength, I pray, Lord, to your children. Lord, be with brother Jeremy, Brother Danny Steamman there, Lord. May you, oh God, just give them such a a strength, Lord, physically and oh God, just use them, Lord, as channels, Lord, God, to minister, Lord, to those needs that would be present there, Lord. that it would be so undeniable Lord that God that you have been mindful and your care and Father for what you have done Lord all the glory will go to you. We ask Lord for your blessings now upon the remaining part of the service. Lord, I pray God together that myself and the congregation. We want to be just one with you, Lord. And just help us, Lord. I pray tonight that we can so get out of the way, Father, that God, that the thought that you've placed in our hearts could just be conveyed, Lord, by you. That would be my desire, Lord. May you come, Lord, the spirit of truth and just speak to our hearts now in Jesus precious name. Amen. Amen. God bless you as you're being seated. So I want to uh look here here in this um in this moment from the uh looking at that thought on accumulation of godly uh confidence because we know that even as we walk on in our journey uh with the Lord Lord, that there is is a confidence. And when you think of confidence, I want you to think of trust. And I want you to think also faith. And I want you to think of love because it all uh works to great works together in a great in a great harmony. And we we understand that even as the as the prophet would would teach us that it is love that actually is what produces faith. And this is where that even as we uh look here at at the word of God and to know that um in God's word that God would express um his word to our hearts. But God his desire is that we would see him. And that's that's that's the whole cusp of it all is that we would see him. We would recognize his presence. We would recognize his love and his desire for our life. And brother Brandon will take this within um within the message thy house and he will uh deal with this and looking at it in terms of that of a relationship. And he said, "I was telling my wife the other day of just how much that um that I had loved her." And he says, "You know, I guess it's okay for me to talk about this in public." He said, "And and she just began to speak about Bill. You know, I'm getting fat and turning gray." And you know, Brother Bram had away with words, didn't he? And uh and he said, you know, he he he told her, he said, it it really wouldn't matter no matter to what degree of size and hair and all this like that. He says, because it's based on love. And he says, you know, and he begins to give counsel even to the young ones that are sitting there because this is a house meeting. And he says there, but there's something about you that you love her. And that's the same thing. There's something about him that you love him whether he's handsome or not, whether she's pretty or not. Uh that really doesn't matter whether you love them just the same. But you know, and I know we could deal with this part of it because sometimes with young people when we're talking about they say, "Well, is there a part of attraction?" And sure, there's a part of attraction. But the one thing that you begin to look at is deeper than what can be the attraction out here is when you begin to get to know the character and that person and that individual. and they might be a real royal uh character, but maybe it just something as you're praying and you're waiting and you're looking to God, you just can never get settled on that. And God God knows just how to lead us. You know, he every time with God's will, the dove of the Holy Spirit is always accompanied right there. And so God knows just how to lead and to guide us. and what what really matters even as the the message of the hour would take us to really see that it's really character that really matters and when you you think of that even in terms of the message of the hour you recognize that the message itself it's Christ being revealed and remember it's still the same parallel of Isaiah 53 he still is despised and rejected of men when the when the scripture was wrote there on Isaiah 53 it never said he will be despised Ed, it says he is despised and rejected of men because Christ was rejected in Noah. Christ was rejected in Isaiah. Christ was rejected in Jeremiah. But among the elect, they received the servants that God sent. So then they received the word of God and they received that portion and they received God's blessing to their life. But it was Christ in those men. So it's looking beyond the frame and the veil and it's looking in that's where within the the message of the hour when we express that and as we've been just laboring within that that it's it's not uh confined it's not a group or collections of doctrines. It's not how well we can recite something but it's meeting the very person of Jesus Christ. And that's what really matters within a life because that's what really holds and that's what really brings stability through all of the tests and trials because life is filled with test and trials and we're not we're not uh as far as troubles they they have troubles out there we have troubles as well but the difference is is where you're anchored and you know in whom you have believed &gt;&gt; and so brother Brown picks this up and he says you know he says now within In that he says a marriage itself based anything uh outside of that it'll never be successful. It'll never be happy. He says you know he says you can get around one thing and friends a conversion outside of the same thing won't last either. When you go to church and say I'm going to join church and going to be baptized. If that isn't coming from a heart of love to God yonder it'll never go nowhere. All you'll do is join church and be baptized. &gt;&gt; See, the the objective is is to fall in love with him. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon makes a very key statement in restoration of the bride tree. He says, "Let him he says all you have to do is yield and he will take you to your healing. He will take you to the baptism of the Holy Ghost." And see, it becomes it it it's it's where God reveals his love. That's where that even when John I just think back to that scripture. I love how John writes that in first John that herein have we known and believed the love that God hath to us. &gt;&gt; I'M YOU CANNOT NO WONDER with the the the man who was writing the love of God how rich and pure. THERE'S NO WAY in our mind to wrap our natural or finite mind around it because the love of God is so much deeper. It's so much greater. IT'S NOT A LOVE that's even based upon the conditions of time. It's a love that originates from eternity that reaches into time AND BRINGS DELIVERANCE AND CONTACTS US BACK to the representation and whom that God knew that you and I always were. It brings us into that real relationship with him. So, you know, this is why that brother Brandham goes on to say, he says, "Now, when you're converted to Christ, a love to Christ, then you accumulate a faith in Christ like you would to your wife or to your husband. You accumulate a faith that you walk in that faith. It just something about it that anchors you there." So, he goes on to say, "That's the same way it is about Christ." And what Christ says, you believe it and you just stay right with it. And that's the way it just raises you up right above it. And God brings it to pass and fulfills his promise. If thou will believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, thy and thy house shall be saved. And I would just say it in this manner that if you haven't listened to this message in a while, thy house, and you're praying for loved ones, I tell you, you talking about a message to go and listen to and sit down and just brother Brandon, just speaking in that with that group that's there in Typton, Georgia, there's so much application on how to approach things in faith with our family and to hold on to the promises of almighty God. And you so there is an accumulation of faith within our lives. There's there's more there's a faith that is greater or should be greater in our life and in our walk now than what it was than when we first believed. And to be you know to accumulate there's a there's a lot of things that when we uh look at this with accumulation it is it's a gathering of things. And I think probably we would be maybe uh professionals on some of this because we accumulate certain things. Everybody has something you kind of accumulate. You know, we sometimes it's not it's sometimes it's things that I'm going to save this for later. I'm going to save this for later. I'm going to save this for later. What are those screws to? I don't know. But we may use them, you know. And and I understand sometimes it all depends on um where where people have come from. &gt;&gt; Like my mama Brown, she froze everything. She froze even Halloween candy and she would pull it out and well I don't have to describe all it but you know she came through those times of the depression. So you know the it just become a a natural thing and you know that's the wild sometimes if you maybe you know you have maybe a little more than what you had before you still you look at things in a still in the same light and you're just like my I don't want to get rid of this. I don't want to get rid of this and you might need this and so uh but my point is is not for us to look at one another but my point is is that we understand what accumulation is and accumulation is not something that just takes place like massive halls all at once. &gt;&gt; It's things little by little by little by little. &gt;&gt; And that's the same way it is with our faith, our walk with God. There is an accumulation. And it's not something that we are sensing even in that moment and even sometimes the circumstances through the tests through the trials and even how God would direct us in his word we're not even uh seeing the whole picture but it isn't until we've come to that place and being able to look back and we can see my Lord Jesus how that you have brought me to where I am and we also are appreciative appreciative of his leadership in these moments OF JUST HIS NUDGES here and there and how he's there to guide us and we appreciate and it's building a faith within our life to where we walk within that confidence. SO IT'S NOT A MAN-MADE CONFIDENCE. IN OTHER WORDS, THIS IS NOT A CONFIDENCE THAT COMES BECAUSE I CAN PUT two and two together, but it's a confidence that has accumulated because of the love of God. And we are witnessing that in our own lives through all of our shortcomings. We're witnessing it how God will minister to us in the very needs in our life where he'll come into times of devotion where he'll come right through the messages and here we are listening to a message and God WILL DROP SOMETHING RIGHT DOWN AN ANSWER that we've been praying about AND WE WATCH GOD'S CARE AND AS WE TAKE that in what we're doing through a RELATIONSHIP IT BUILDS a faith and an accumulation that cannot be schooled led into us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It comes through experiences. It comes through time. And so this accumulation, I want to just say it in this way that the accumulation of this faith, it will happen and it will never be greater than the love of God that's able to support it and guide it. Amen. So this is why when brother Brandham would always as Paul would make the distinction between um that of faith to move mountains or from gifts of healing, working of miracles, gifts of faith all the way through there and brother Ram will put that distinction in the message desperation among other places showing us that there can be great faith that can even be utilized uh even when it's not a sincere heart. And you would say, "Well, how could that be not a sincere heart?" Because when it's not sincerely lined up and grounded with God by a real birth. &gt;&gt; And so where this faith that we're talking about, it's a faith that Paul wrote of where Paul said, "The the life that I'm now living, I'm living by the faith of the Son of God." This is the same faith that Jude said we're to earnestly contend for. This is the same faith that Paul wrote in Romans 12 that God had dealt to every man a measure of faith. This faith that we're talking about is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that sixth sense that drops into the heart of an individual that you may never maybe your calling isn't to lay hands on people. MAYBE THERE'S YOU MAYBE THERE'S NOT a calling yet. I believe everyone that as a believer you're going to be you're be called to do that at some point or another. But I think you understand what I mean is is that there may not be things that you would be uh called to do out here, BUT YET THE CONSTANT STANDING and believing in God's word and a FAITH THAT HOLDS STEADY THAT EVEN WHEN GOD SAYS NO, YOU STAND right there and YOU LOVE HIM JUST THE SAME. So in other words, your love is not dictated or determined based on uh how how good the bank account is or how good things are going at home or how good things are going. BUT BUT BUT THERE HAS GOT TO BE a real a love. And I know ALL OF THOSE THINGS CAN HAVE TRIED TO AFFECT AND TRY TO INFLUENCE, BUT IT'S A FAITH THAT HOLDS STEADY THROUGH THE MIDST OF IT ALL. SURE, you may get down. Sure, you may feel like I can't put one foot in front OF THE OTHER. BUT THAT'S WHY IT'S GOT TO BE A FAITH THAT'S GREATER than intellectual faith because AN INTELLECTUAL FAITH, IT ONLY TAKES A MATTER OF TIME AND IT can be blown right out. BUT WHEN IT'S FAITH THAT'S GROUNDED THAT THERE IS IT'S FOUNDED ON A ROCK, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT COMES YOUR WAY. THERE MIGHT BE STORMS, THERE'S TRIALS, THERE'S WIND, THERE'S ALL SORTS OF THINGS, BUT IT CANNOT TAKE AWAY THAT EXPERIENCE THAT'S FOUNDED ON A ROCK. CAN DO IT. SO GOD WILL ALWAYS HOW GOD IS WORKING WITH ALL of this is that the accumulation of this confidence and I want you to think once again of this linked together with love. It'll never be greater than the than the love of God is able to support it and guide it in OUR LIFE BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT produces faith is REAL TRUE LOVE. NOW REMEMBER, BROTHER BRAM STARTS IT JUST JUST JUST STARTING OUT WITH EVEN LOOKING at where you were and where you are now, &gt;&gt; right? Brother Bram takes THAT IN PERFECT FAITH BECAUSE HE SAYS FAITH IS BASED on forgiveness. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? SO YOU'RE ABLE TO SAY LIKE THE PROPHET SAYS, "LOOK WHERE YOU WERE. LOOK WHERE YOU ARE." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHAT DID THAT somebody who loved you? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. AND HE SAYS THAT OUGHT TO create a perfect faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, BY DOING WHAT? LOOKING AT WHERE that he has taken YOU FROM AND WHERE YOU ARE. AND SURE, ALL of us can say tonight that, you know, I'm not what I want I ought to be. I'M NOT EVEN WHAT I WANT TO BE, BUT I'M NOT WHAT I USED to be. All right. &gt;&gt; AND IT'S GOOD TO KNOW TO HAVE THAT declaration in our HEARTS BECAUSE WE ARE PRESSING ON THE UPWARD WAY. &gt;&gt; THERE IS AN ACCUMULATION. There is accumulating. And we want to be accumulating the right things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because I can tell you in this life we can accumulate the wrong things. &gt;&gt; This flesh. Remember the prophet says that even after the new birth has come, he says that sticky carnal nature is always going to bother you until this life has been fully developed &gt;&gt; out &gt;&gt; from that new birth until we go. But you know he also told us in the message ashamed that when we don't abide in the presence of God that's when we also get prickly and you know we we all can fellowship from this area because I think even sister Judith you all in Cleveland probably have it too. doesn't make much sense to me. But at any rate, when they when we have the recyclable trash and and and and it seems like every single night we have trash collection the next morning is windy. &gt;&gt; You almost want to say, "Everybody just dump your trash right back here on my patio. I'll just pick it up." That's a little sarcasm, but you know, the thing of it is you you know, I I get I get the some of the principles and I I understand some of that. But what I'm saying is is that THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT get collected. There's things that all the way through the hydrangeas on either side. I look out there in the in the in the woods and you know, from where they're building across the way and man, there's just big sheets of that Tyvec that are just blasted up against trees BECAUSE WHAT IS IT? IT WOULD HAVE KEPT ON GOING, BUT THERE'S THINGS that caught it. &gt;&gt; And this is why that in our LIFE THAT STICKY PART AND THOSE THINGS ABOUT OUR LIFE, IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE THERE. But this is why we have to have TO BE FIRMLY AWARE. IT'S SO EASY FOR US, THE FLESH PART, TO CATCH THOSE THINGS that are carnal. &gt;&gt; So and so said this to me, so and so didn't do this. my husband said this or my wife said this or so and so didn't shake my hand or this and we CAN GO RIGHT ACROSS THE BOARD AND IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL we accumulate the wrong things. &gt;&gt; AND ONE OF THE SIGNS THAT WHEN your accumulation is going the WRONG DIRECTION IS HOW is your love to the Lord? Now, ONE WAY TO MEASURE HOW YOUR LOVE is to the LORD IS IS HOW IS YOUR LOVE toward one another? &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; See, THAT'S WHERE THAT'S WHERE WE KNOW, AM I RIGHT WHERE I NEED to be, even within THE PRESENCE OF GOD. YOU SAY, "HOW DO I KNOW THAT I'M RIGHT WHERE I NEED TO BE?" TO WHERE YOU'RE NEVER LOOKING DOWN ON SOMEONE ELSE. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IF YOU'RE EVER LOOKING DOWN, YOU'RE IN the wrong position. But always even even in situations to where we bring uh needs to the Lord IN PRAYER, WE'RE LIFTING UP AND SAYING, "GOD, MY BROTHER, MY SISTER, YOU KNOW THE NEED, LORD, THAT'S PRESENT IN THEIR LIFE, LORD. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GOING THROUGH. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'VE BEEN THROUGH. I DON'T KNOW WHY MAYBE THEY'VE RESPONDED THIS WAY, BUT YOU DO, LORD. THAT'S MY BROTHER. THAT'S MY SISTER, LORD. MINISTER TO THEIR NEEDS, LORD, AND CONDITION MY HEART, LORD. All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; SO, IT'S SIMPLY TO TRUST GOD. THIS LOVE, it'll remember, IT'S IT'S LOVE THAT PUSHES OUR FAITH out onto the battlefront to stand. And it's trust and confidence in his word simply because he said it. And that's through that comes through fellowship with him. It's got to is a peace that passes all understanding. a faith that'll master THE CIRCUMSTANCES BY STANDING ON WHAT GOD HAS SAID. NOT NOT THAT YOU KNOW HOW. THAT'S NOT MASTERY OF THE CIRCUMSTANCE. BUT MASTERING THE CIRCUMSTANCE IS KNOWING in whom you have believed. &gt;&gt; MASTERING THE CIRCUMSTANCE DOES NOT EVEN MEAN THAT YOU'VE GOT YOUR PRAYER ANSWERED THE WAY YOU'VE PRAYED. BECAUSE IN HEBREWS 11, IN THE HEROES OF FAITH, THERE WERE SOME WHO WERE KILLED, TORTURED. YES. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME? NOT ALL WERE DELIVERED FROM THE MOUTH OF THE LIONS. &gt;&gt; BUT THEY ALL HAD A TESTIMONY AND IT WAS ALL VITAL AND IT WAS ALL JUST AS GREAT AS THE OTHER. &gt;&gt; It's the hall of fame &gt;&gt; of faith and of trust of confidence. They, the Bible tells us in the book of Revelations, they loved not their own lives unto death. &gt;&gt; Not until death. They didn't come right up to the point of it and then pull back, but unto they submitted &gt;&gt; all the way through. &gt;&gt; That's really good. Let's look at a few scriptures here. &gt;&gt; In Ephesians 3:17, Paul said that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love. So to dwell in faith, being rooted. So I there's A SOURCE THAT I'M DRAWING from because when you're ROOTED AND GROUNDED, YOU'RE DRAWING from an unseen source. And listen, this is why uh I think about, you've heard me share this before, that even within uh plants and things like that, like when we had these planted out here and then and then these planted, when we would would water them, you're wanting not a it doesn't matter if you get the leaves or not, but it is it's a slow watering that will actually absorb in the ground because what it's being done, it's teaching THE ROOTS TO GO DEEP. &gt;&gt; IF YOU JUST WATER A LOT ON TOP, IT TEACHES THE ROOTS JUST TO STAY ON A SURFACE LEVEL. AND THIS IS WHY GOD TAKES US. WE NEED, listen to me now, we need experiences. THIS IS WHY WE NEED WE AND GOD CAN DO IT ON A THURSDAY NIGHT. HE CAN DO IT ON A SUNDAY. GOD CAN DO IT and you know, just like AT A YOUTH CAMP. BUT GOD DOESN'T WANT EVERY SERVICE. IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A YOUTH CAMP SERVICE. &gt;&gt; EVERY SERVICE. YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE THAT THOSE THERE IS A NEED FOR THAT. GOD IS INTERESTED IN BUILDING PEOPLE'S FAITH AND TO BRING ABOUT A REAL BIRTH AND A REAL EXPERIENCE. AND THAT'S HOW HE WANTS TO DO EVEN IN EVERY SERVICE. BUT YET, THERE'S ALSO GOT TO BE TRAINING AND TEACHING &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD DOESN'T WANT TO LEAVE YOU AS JUST A NURSERY PLANT AND SAY, "WELL, I'M JUST TRYING TO WORK ON EVERYBODY ELSE." GOD IS WORKING ON ALL ACCOUNTS AT THE SAME TIME AND HE'S TEACHING us by his spirit to go deeper. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because there's storms. &gt;&gt; And there's also a source that we're to draw from that when dryness comes because you'll have dry seasons in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You will. Every you don't have you don't have every season's not a wet season. So God teaches us to go and trains us to go deeper. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So there's stability that even when in our lives you don't feel him when you're praying when you have to come and you're coming to a service and you're pressing more. It's not a service that's almost like sometimes how brother Brian describes it like brother Brian will say you know at times man I I can just be up here and say hey uh let's you know let's sing this song boom it's ready to explode there's all all of those moments right and then there's other times where you feel like you're the ox of the team and you're pulling and you're pulling but every one of those is everything each one is DIFFERENT AND WE CAN SAY WELL THIS ONE SHOULD DO THIS AND this one SHOULD DO THAT BUT GOD IS TRAINING LEADING US TO THAT THAT WE ARE TO DRAW FROM THAT UNSEEN SOURCE TO WHERE THAT WHEN EVEN WHEN EVERYTHING ELSE AROUND US THERE MIGHT BE DRYNESS BUT YOU ARE TAPPED IN TO JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND THERE'S A FAITH AND A CONFIDENCE THAT YOU CAN STAND THERE that no matter what situation rises or even as God would minister to things in our hearts and our lives there is a faith that is residing there. Because how many know it's true that there's times when situations come up, you don't have time to go and say, "Well, I'm going to go pray through." &gt;&gt; You don't have time for that. Jesus never said, "You know what? I'm going to go pray through. So, you all just wait at the front of the boat and I'm going be back here praying through." No. He knew who he was. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'll say it in this way. It It's not sliding prayer, but it's saying that contact and that constant fellowship with God and all of that. Don't put it on a time ratio, but stay in contact with him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Stay in contact with him. Be ready at all times. Even in those moments just just ready to just for to step in and you know, well, brother Samuel, I feel unworthy. Why? Well, brother Sam, I haven't had time in prayer today. Really? What kind of time are you gauging? Are you saying you haven't had an hour? So, show me a scripture that'll make you worthy after an hour. &gt;&gt; SEE, THAT'S MAN'S TRADITION. &gt;&gt; THAT'S HINDRANCES. AND WHAT THAT IS THAT HINDERS GROWTH. &gt;&gt; AND IT'S THINGS THAT SOMETIMES THAT WE HAVEN'T EVEN BEEN TAUGHT. IT'S JUST THINGS THAT WE FEEL. &gt;&gt; I know I can go through quotes or I can go through scripture. Oh sweet hour of prayer. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. LOVE THAT SONG. Oh to kneel in prayer. RIGHT. AND WE WE HAVE THOSE THINGS. AND SOMETIMES IT'S NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT AS FAR AS OH WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TIME WITH GOD. WHAT IT WHAT IT'S SPEAKING ABOUT IS THAT THERE IS TO HAVE A MOMENT WITH GOD. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT ITSELF IT GROWS. YOU BEGIN TO REALIZE THAT IT'S NOT LIMITED TO JUST WHEN YOU'RE ON YOUR KNEES THAT YOU CAN STAY AS PAUL SAID IN THAT CHAPTER WHERE IT'S A CHAPTER OF BATTLE PRAYING WITHOUT CEASING. &gt;&gt; Tell me how that's done if you've got to be in your prayer closet the whole time. Well, brother Samuel, what he was saying is is don't cease to be in your prayer closet. HE'S SAYING PRAY WITHOUT CEASING. PAUL WOULD SAY STANDING. But David WOULD SAY LAYING. RIGHT? SO IT'S A CONSTANT STAYING in a state of prayer. That's why the prophet said regarding Abraham when he saw them coming, he said Abraham kept himself in an atmosphere of prayer at all times. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We got to get going here. Peace be to the brethren and LOVE WITH faith from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. SO NOTICE HOW BRINGING THIS TOGETHER and love with faith. &gt;&gt; Paul says, "And the grace of our Lord WAS EXCEEDING ABUNDANT WITH FAITH and love which is in Christ Jesus." PAUL SAID, "HOLD FAST the form of sound words which thou has heard of me in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus." He goes on, "NOW I WANT YOU TO THINK OF THIS HERE. THE DESIRE OF FAITH and how faith and love operates together." And notice this commenation in these three points in in in Fameon. says, "Hearing of thy love and faith WHICH THOU HAST TOWARD THE LORD Jesus and toward all saints." He says the very same thing in the NEXT TWO CHAPTERS. SO there there is there IS NO WAY FOR US TO HAVE THE FAITH in the right way to THE LORD JESUS AND NOT HAVE LOVE UNTO ALL the saints because I would say within that all that all reccluded all. Right? &gt;&gt; It even INCLUDED THOSE THAT RUBBED YOU a little bit and you rubbed them. &gt;&gt; BUT IT WAS A LOVE. SEE, LOVE IS NOT ABOUT THAT. WE ALWAYS SEE EYE TO EYE. BUT IT OUGHT TO BE SUCH A LOVE THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE NOTICEABLE. OH, THIS ONE HAS SOMETHING AGAINST this one. OH, THIS ONE HAS A PROBLEM HERE. HOW DO YOU KNOW IT'S STANDING OUT? IT OUGHT TO BE LOVE THAT IS GLUING AND BRINGING US TOGETHER. BECAUSE LET ME TELL YOU, IF OTHERS CAN NOTICE IT, THE DEVIL NOTICES IT AND HE'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO POUR IT ON AND THERE'LL BE AN ACCUMULATION IN the wrong way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is why we need not only the discernment of the Holy Spirit, but we need, oh God, let our hearts just be right in tune and submission to your will. James chapter 2:5, remember James is writing in a very pastoral letter about how there were differences being made. you know, with this one right here. You know, they've got a powerful 401k. Uh they drive a Cadillac, they do this. You sit right here. And then they have another one over here that maybe they're riding a red wagon to church. Uh you sat down there on the stool. &gt;&gt; See, they were making after evil thoughts. &gt;&gt; I know sometimes that we Let me just preach a little bit on this. Sometimes we can say, "Brother Samuel, that's very kindergartenish." But sometimes if we're not careful, you can start to place people because they check this box, they check that box, they check this box, they check this box. But what's most important is is you don't know if they've checked the box of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And you know what? There ain't no way for you to know. &gt;&gt; That's why when brother Brandham was asked the question, "Brother Brandom, I want to be able to tell if somebody's got the Holy Ghost." Brother Brandham said, "No, brother, that's not something for you." &gt;&gt; Right. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I don't know why somebody would even be worried about that. &gt;&gt; The Bible said, "Let every man take account of HIS OWN &gt;&gt; HIS OWN SELF." &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY WITHIN A SERVICE, DON'T LET THE DEVIL DISTRACT YOU AND GET YOUR EYES OVER HERE. LOOK, LOOK, FRIENDS, AS THE PASTOR OF THIS ASSEMBLY, I'VE GOT A RESPONSIBILITY FOR EVERYONE THAT COMES HERE AND LOOKS TO THIS THIS PLACE AS YOUR HOME CHURCH AND MYSELF AS YOUR PASTOR. I'VE GOT A RESPONSIBILITY. BUT LET ME JUST TELL YOU, WHEN THE WORD IS COMING FORTH, MY HEART IS OPEN BEFORE GOD. I'M NOT HERE LOOKING and saying, "Well, this one, THIS AND THIS ONE, THIS." CAN YOU IMAGINE YOU WALK OUT OF SERVICE, WHAT DID YOU GET? WELL, THIS ONE, THIS, and this one, that. AND THEN I ASKED YOU, "WHAT DID YOU GET?" &gt;&gt; AND IF ALL YOU CAN SEE IS SHORTCOMINGS, &gt;&gt; YOU NEED TO ASK GOD for a real refilling of THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; I'M BEING SERIOUS, FRIENDS. WE CAN THEN THAT THAT CANNOT BE A PART OF OUR LIFE AND THEN EXPECT TO BE A A LIFE THAT EVEN OUR FAMILY WANTS TO BE around &gt;&gt; because your picking won't stop with one person. &gt;&gt; It'll keep on going. &gt;&gt; But God help us. &gt;&gt; God help us. WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE. I DON'T CARE IF IT'S A PERSON that they walk IN HERE 15 MINUTES LATE. I WANT TO ENCOURAGE THEM. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU HEARING ME, FRIENDS? BECAUSE IT MAY NOT BE THAT WAY THE WHOLE TIME, BUT I WANT TO ENCOURAGE THEM IN THEIR WALK WITH GOD. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; That's why Paul, this is why JAMES WROTE THIS. HATH NOT GOD CHOSEN THE POOR of this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him? That's why I've said this. I've given brother Carlos a rose many times. I APPRECIATE HIM STANDING OUT THERE AND GREETING AS PEOPLE ARE COMING IN. I APPRECIATE THAT BECAUSE THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE I'VE BEEN PLACES WHERE YOU'RE NOT GREETED AND THE PROPHET TELLS US THE DEACONS ARE TO GREET AT THE DOOR &gt;&gt; AND WELCOMING THE PEOPLE IN. SEE, THAT'S PART OF THE SACRIFICE THAT THE DEACONS have to make. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; THAT'S PART OF THE SACRIFICE JUST LIKE TRUSTEES HAVE IT AND MUSICIANS HAVE IT. THEY HAVE THE THERE'S ALL OF THAT THAT PART THAT GOES INTO IT TO GREET PEOPLE, TO ENCOURAGE ONE ANOTHER. BROTHER, I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU. GOD BLESS YOU. IT'S SO GOOD TO BE HERE. SO GOOD TO SEE YOU. ENCOURAGE THEM BECAUSE LISTEN, WHATEVER NEEDS TO BE DONE, it will have to be a God thing. &gt;&gt; See, you have to be able to stop and think and think, if my life and my testimony and what I'm saying, is it encouraging people? &gt;&gt; I want to be an encouragement. &gt;&gt; I sure do. I want to be an encouragement to somebody. I want to be encouragement to God's children. So you notice, rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom, which he had promised to them that love him. FOR IN JESUS CHRIST, NEITHER circumcision avaleth anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith which workketh by love. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I think that when we consider this of how the faith and love working together through the scriptures, remember Paul would write of how charity never faileth. He would remind us of the three that's always a part of the fulfillment of God's word, hope, faith, and charity, and remind us that the greatest of these is charity. Brother Brandon would say it like this. He says, "Love the Lord with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, with all your strength, and faith will accompany that love." ABRAHAM HAD TO LOVE GOD to believe him. Do you love him? And more you love him, the more faith will accumulate. Right. &gt;&gt; See, this is why that in this hour when we we think OF HOW THAT GOD HAS DONE IN THIS hour with with loosening the seals from off of the book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; THE THE SEVEN THUNDERS THAT OF GOD, GOD'S VOICE, GOD revealing his word, his secrets, revealing his WORD TO OUR HEART. WHAT IS THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF THAT? IS TO BUILD a rapturing faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. AND IT IS THROUGH THAT THAT PREPARES the church, GETS IT IN ORDER, GETS IT READY FOR THE GOING HOME. THAT'S THAT'S WHAT GOD IS DOING WITH THIS WORD THAT HE'S GIVEN. AND THIS IS WHY THAT IN THIS HOUR THAT THE BRIDE, WHAT IS DIFFERENT IS THERE IS A FAITH WITHIN THE BRIDE THAT IT'S NOT AN INTELLECTUAL FAITH. IT IS THE SAME FAITH THAT WAS ONCE delivered to THE SAINTS BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT THE MINISTRY OF MALACHI 4 WAS ALL ABOUT. THE PROPHET SAID HE WILL SEW THE ENTIRE REVELATION ALL THE WAY ON DOWN. HE SAID HE WILL ALSO IT WILL BE A RESTORING OF BIBLE FAITH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's what the ministry of the word in this hour has done to bring us back to a Bible faith. to simply be able to stand on God's word because he said it. &gt;&gt; So the more you love him, the more faith will accumulate. Now I I like uh brother Brandham, you know, he applies this real quickly. He goes into this about with Abraham here with El Shadi. Now you know when you think about the the uh that of how God would reveal himself to Abraham as El Shadi, God reveals and makes known to Abraham. Abraham, come next to me and draw from me into you what's needed to produce. &gt;&gt; Think about this. It was Abraham. He was walking all the way through his journey. We looked at this a couple weeks ago when he was going THROUGH HIS JOURNEY. HE HAD HIS UPS AND DOWNS. &gt;&gt; HE HAD HIS SHORTCOMINGS. But within IT ALL, YOU COULD NOT GET ABRAHAM AWAY FROM THE PROMISE THAT GOD GAVE HIM. &gt;&gt; HE KEPT GOING. &gt;&gt; HE KEPT COMING BACK. YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE HE COULDN'T ESCAPE THE PLAN AND PROGRAM OF ALMIGHTY GOD. NO MATTER WHERE HE WOULD GO, IF ABRAHAM WENT DOWN WHEN HE WENT DOWN TO EGYPT, HE COULD NOT BE COMFORTABLE DOWN THERE IN EGYPT. WHY? THAT WAS NOT WHERE HE BELONGED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; GOD REMOVED COMFORT TO GET HIM BACK INTO THE LAND. AND THAT'S THE SAME THING THAT GOD DOES WITH YOU AND I. HE'LL REMOVE COMFORT TO GET US BACK TO WHERE WE NEED TO BE. AND NOT JUST BACK TO WHERE WE NEED TO BE, but to continue to walk on with him. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what he did with Lot. He allowed the circumstances to arise. But you know, when a baby, you know, brother Abraham called said God's word is his breast and he brought he brought Abraham up close. And Abraham, you know, when like a child can be fretting, man can be so tore up, but they just get next to mama. And it's not the nourishment. I know sometimes a man, THEY COULD EAT A HOUSE DOWN, BUT IT'S NOT SO MUCH THE NOURISHMENT WHAT CALMS IT. IT'S THAT CLOSENESS, THAT INTIMACY, THAT RECOGNIZING THAT SAME HEARTBEAT &gt;&gt; THAT WAS THERE in the beginning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AND THAT JUST BEGINS TO CALM THEM AND AND then they're taking in the nourishment and they're AND THEY'RE JUST THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY JUST, YOU KNOW, THEY'LL just go right to sleep. AND SAME THING THAT GOD, THIS IS WHY GOD BRINGS YOU AND I. HE WOOS US UP NEXT TO HIM. AND HERE COME AND FOR WHAT PURPOSE? TO SETTLE US IN OUR FRETTING, IN our weakness, IN TIMES IN OUR LIFE, IN OUR JOURNEY WHERE IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THAT MY THAT EVERYTHING AROUND US IS SPINNING. BUT GOD KNOWS HOW TO DRAW us &gt;&gt; to where he'll settle us. &gt;&gt; True. This is why that even when Abraham, look how that Paul would write this in in Romans 4, he considered not his own body now dead. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Abraham no doubt got to a spot where he had to think about getting out of bed. &gt;&gt; It wasn't which what foot goes first that comes later. It was just thinking about getting out of bed. Then he would see the hunchback. Then he would also not only see HIMSELF BUT SEE SARAH. And it wasn't like things was climbing upward, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; BUT THE BODY WAS FAILING, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; THE EVERYTHING AROUND HIM THAT HE COULD SEE WITH HIS SENSES. AND WHEN HE COULD HEAR SARAH GO, "OH, SNAP, CRACKLE, POP." &gt;&gt; OH, &gt;&gt; ABRAHAM, I I I'll get breakfast for you as soon as I can get over there. Don't worry, dear. I can't even straighten up right now myself. &gt;&gt; EVERYTHING AROUND THE SENSES, THE SENSES, EVERYTHING AROUND THEM WAS TOTALLY CONTRARY TO THE PROMISE THAT WAS ON THE INSIDE. &gt;&gt; BUT THE PROMISE ON THE INSIDE IS WHAT allowed Abraham to look beyond his senses. &gt;&gt; AMENISE &gt;&gt; AND CONSIDER NOT. IN OTHER WORDS, he never took them in. He never looked at them and brought it in line with God's word and said, "Huh, I wonder my this is, you know, I'm it's getting worse. It's not getting better. It's man, my pain, everything is getting worse. I'm more of a hunchback." NO, NO. ALL ALONG HE WAS DRAWING FROM THAT WORD. BUT NOTICE NOTICE HOW ABRAHAM'S JOURNEY, THE PROPHET TAKES IT IN Genesis 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. HE TAKES IT ALL THE WAY UP INTO THAT PLACE OF GENESIS 18 AND SHOWING THE PROGRESSION OF THE CHURCH of the living God and even you and I as an individual and how that faith is being accumulated &gt;&gt; and God is moving and working and he's operating within our lives. I know this is very very simple but the prophet would say it just like this in perfect faith. It says when he was 100 years old 25 years later he was stronger believing it. &gt;&gt; He didn't get weaker. He got stronger. And Jehovah Gyra says he still believed it stronger than he did the first place. 25 years to keep building. and he had 25 years to keep building more faith onto it. So there was a building an accumulating that was going on within his life. I we can look and you if you all you see is Abraham's failures you're missing seeing the accumulation &gt;&gt; because you don't go from Genesis 12 to Genesis 22. But that what we see in Genesis 22, it was within that seed the whole time. &gt;&gt; It was there the whole time. And even through look look friends, EVEN THROUGH HIS FAILURES. YOU THINK HOW HOW COULD HOW COULD FAITH GROW EVEN THROUGH MY FAILURES? BECAUSE GOD EXPRESSES HIS LOVE AND HIS CARE FOR YOU to bring you back to teach you TO SPEAK TO YOUR HEART. AND YOU CAN SEE THIS IS A LOVE THAT YOU CANNOT ESCAPE. &gt;&gt; IT'S A LOVE THAT'S NOT BASED ON YOUR WORKS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; It's not based on your merits. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's based on him. &gt;&gt; And that's that's wonderful because if it's if it's on you and I, boy, there's a problem. &gt;&gt; It's always been a problem. Anytime there was a covenant that it was based on part of it with man. But this is why it's an unconditional covenant &gt;&gt; and it's a God who is fulfilling his word in our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes God has to bring us back into a place to where we will yield. And he's letting us know, look, I've only asked you to be the channel. I'm the one doing it. &gt;&gt; I'm the one doing it. &gt;&gt; Can I have just a few more moments? Let me just try to move let me try to move through this this part of it here. You can read these these portions of scripture later on. But just looking in in the in that of of the church in Thessalonica and even what a what a beginning it had. What a when I say a rough beginning, I mean such where it was such a test right there and how that everything came about for this church and how that it was birthed right out of Paul and the missionary journey right there. But Paul would write of, and I'm just going to kind of skip through this. Paul would write and acknowledge their work of faith, their labor of love, and their patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ. And knowing, brethren, beloved, your election of God. Now he's pointing out their faith even as Paul would go on in THIS SAME CHAPTER OF HOW THAT THE TESTIMONY of their faith is even reaching to others. So their faith THERE'S A IT'S A SOUNDING OUT SO THAT PAUL IS actually taking account from others of the effect of the gospel on their life because the effect of the gospel on their life has made its way and touched others. And Paul is writing about the work of faith wherein that they turned to God. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE'S WRITING ABOUT THEIR LABOR OF LOVE IN THAT THEY SERVED the living and true God. HE'S WRITING OF THEIR PATIENCE IN THAT THEY WERE WAITING. They they they came into a place of waiting. They were waiting with faith for that of his return. Notice this in the scripture. I'm just I'm just just dealing with this this portion. Paul writes of how that Timothy brought the report of their faith and charity back to him. How they were comforted and that all of the affliction and distress by your faith that you stand fast in the Lord. I think what a what a testimony because I want to just say it in this way. We know there's always there always can be an attack. But friends, it's easy when everything's on a mountain. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; It's easy when everything's going just right. &gt;&gt; But fruit's not produced on the mountain. That's right. &gt;&gt; God never even wanted us to even say, "Well, you just seek for mountaintop experiences." God doesn't want you living by mountaintop experiences. &gt;&gt; Mountaintop experiences have significance in the scriptures. They are significant moments. But what God does on a mountain, he prepares you for what's coming in the valley. What God did in Genesis 22, he prepared Abraham for Sarah's departure at the bottom of that mountain. &gt;&gt; Same thing with the Lord Jesus on Mount Transfiguration. Prepared him as he came back down. Here was all the troubles. God prepares you in mountaintops for the valley. But the valley is where it expresses what God is doing in our lives. And what a testimony I think of like when you know you read of this and you hear of sister Stadill if you remember and I've referred to this many times where for her she looked at her own LIFE LIKE BROTHER BRANDHAM my baby &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; God God didn't send you over here to PRAY FOR HIM I MUST NOT HAD THAT MUCH FAITH AND BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS no sister you had great faith &gt;&gt; because when God decided to bring your baby on home you remain remained faithful. &gt;&gt; That's great faith. &gt;&gt; Because as I said in Hebrews 11, everything doesn't always go the way that we are looking for it to go. &gt;&gt; Look at this here in verse n. For what thanks can we render to God again for you? For all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before God night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your faith and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith. Paul when he writes this of perfection he's dealing with completeness and maturity. &gt;&gt; Paul's recognizing where they're at. IN OTHER WORDS, PAUL'S NOT EXPECTING THEM TO BE WHERE he is right now. BUT HE KNOWS THAT THERE'S GOT TO BE THAT OF ENCOURAGEMENT AND THE WORD HAS GOT to be laid before them. THERE'S GOT THERE'S GOING TO COME EVEN AS there is afflictions and TESTS AND PERSECUTIONS. BUT EVEN AS THE WORD IS BEING DELIVERED AND AS THEY'RE SUBMITTING TO THAT WORD, THERE WILL BE A PERFECTING of their faith. It'll be there a dissolving of more of more of self. It'll be a completeness. You see the lack of faith when Paul is speaking of this here, he's not speaking of a lack of a new birth. He's speaking of a growth. Let me just let me let me just pick up maybe one more scripture here right here. The very next scripture. Now God himself and our father and our Lord Jesus Christ direct our way unto you. And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another and toward all men even as we do toward you. Let me just say this. Paul was writing this in green. This was an example. Paul might have said, "Maybe I want to go to the Ephesian church more. Maybe he had his preferences kind of fit, you know, Ephesian church, but this was love being expressed. See, sometimes when we're love, listen, uh I'm thinking back from Friday night, I guess what it is, is not about helping little old ladies across the street, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; There's a part of that. But it's about a love like PAUL IS LOOKING AT EVEN HOW GOD WOULD BE SO ATTENTIVE TO THE NEEDS AND THE CARE THAT'S RIGHT HERE &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT AMONG THE PEOPLE AND HOW GOD WOULD TAKE PAUL AND USE PAUL AS A VESSEL TO MINISTER TO THOSE NEEDS. I think I don't I can't remember the saying exactly then you know was I think somebody made the statement about missionary work they said we're so busy looking to send somebody to Ecuador instead of looking next door. I think that's how it went. But you know, it's always like, "Oh, WAY OVER HERE." BUT WHAT ABOUT HERE? &gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT IN YOUR HOME? WHAT ABOUT RIGHT HERE? EVEN LOCALLY, NOTICE GOD MAKE you to increase and abound in love toward one another. In order for that to take place, for love to grow, well, yes, there does have to be some there'll be some differences, but that's not the only way love grows. Love also grows that as we suffer together. Love also grows even as we're we're praying for needs, we're we're looking to God and we are even as in the taking in of of God's word. that love is is growing even in situations that can seem so hard and so difficult. &gt;&gt; Even God can allow. Remember the prophet tells us this in why Christ speaks 63. He says, "You just wait right after a good meeting." He said, "Satan, it'll be just a few days and Satan will be turned loose on that congregation." &gt;&gt; Now, that's not a quote that I have on my refrigerator. That's not a quote that I look that I'm just like I don't I don't I don't focus on that. But what I do know is is because Satan is going to be permitted to come and test to see where did that word fall? &gt;&gt; Did it just fall in our minds? Did it just fall in our spirit? Or has it fallen down or bringing us to a place to say, "Oh God, let it drop in me, Lord. let it drop in me. So, there's a growing I I'm just going to stop with this scripture. We'll pick it up next week. To the end, he may establish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even our father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints. Paul's not speaking of a of a perfection that's the result of the new birth or a perfection as as though that someone lacks it, but rather it's the working of the Holy Spirit in one's life. It's God dealing, ministering to our lives. It's the Holy Spirit coming through the word, dealing with us, admonishing us in order to bring us to a place of perfection. I don't mind telling you as I stop here tonight. I think back to when God first got a hold of my life. You you don't you don't see all the growth that's going to be ahead. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And and just being very honest that you know, we don't start off spiritually mature. We come through all &gt;&gt; of the stages. We come through all of those places and there's things that we we don't see yet about OUR LIFE. AND I'M GLAD BECAUSE IF WE SAW ALL OF THE PERFECTING THAT WAS GOING TO TAKE PLACE AND ALL THAT WAS REALLY NEEDED, you wouldn't be able to enjoy your salvation. &gt;&gt; BUT SEE, GOD DOES IT LITTLE BY LITTLE. IT'S AN ACCUMULATION. WHY? because he's not interested in destroying you. &gt;&gt; But he wants you to joy and enjoy his working in your life, &gt;&gt; even through all your shortcomings, through even where the word the the clarity of the word is like, "Oh, I never seen it like that before." And when you say, "I never seen it like that before." WHAT WHAT YOU REALLY REALIZE IS IS that it stabilizes you. That that that's there. That's the effect. When you see something like you never seen before, I mean, what a blessing it was on Saturday night. &gt;&gt; What a blessing it was on Saturday night with with with the service and you BEGIN TO SAY, "MY, I I DIDN'T SEE THAT. I HEARD different ones say, "My, you know, I WISH I WOULD HAVE HEARD THAT, YOU KNOW, YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS AND years ago." But, you know, aren't you thankful for it? &gt;&gt; And I'm going to SAY IT LIKE THIS RIGHT HERE. LET ME SAY THIS THAT WHEN YOU LOOK BACK, LISTEN TO ME. WHEN YOU LOOK BACK OVER YOUR LIFE, IT WASN'T THAT, "OH, GOD, I WAS FUMBLING AROUND. LORD, I I WAS I I I WISH, LORD, THERE'S A LOT OF REGRETS AND THINGS, YES, THAT WE HAVE, BUT THERE'S A LOT OF WAYS AND PLACES THAT YOU'VE PASSED THROUGH THAT GOD'S GRACE HAS BROUGHT YOU THROUGH. AND YOUR LIFE IS A TESTIMONY OF GOD'S GRACE THAT THROUGH IT ALL, THE PROMISE OF GOD REMAINS SURE." &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND EVERYONE HAS A TESTIMONY WITH GOD. IT DOESN'T ALL LOOK THE SAME. GOD DON'T WANT A SEARS AND ROBOT HARMONY HOUSE. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But there's ONE THING THAT IS THE SAME. The new birth is from death unto life. &gt;&gt; WE DON'T GROW INTO THE NEW BIRTH, BUT THE NEW BIRTH IS A SOVEREIGN ACT BY ALMIGHTY GOD. BUT FROM THERE, &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH, &gt;&gt; we grow. Right? &gt;&gt; This is why remember how the scripture when it tells us Paul writing to the natural fathers, he says, "Don't exasperate. Don't provoke your children to anger lest they be discouraged." &gt;&gt; Parents, don't make a move. I think I got a little something up here. But you you realize that there's times that even within parenting, you could say something And there's times to say something. But you also realize that there's the times and depending on even how each one is natured. You say, "Oh, brother Samuel, it's blanket." God doesn't treat treat this congregation like a blanket. He says he knows every sheep by their character. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; God knows how to approach us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; His character will never change. The mask might look different, but his nature always remains the same. &gt;&gt; It's always the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. He knows how to bring us to himself. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; You see this IS THAT'S THAT'S PART OF GOD'S LOVE. &gt;&gt; GOD DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT. IN OTHER WORDS, GOD'S NOT GOING TO DEAL WITH YOU LIKE HE DEALS WITH BROTHER RICHARD. &gt;&gt; Brother Richard's nature a certain WAY. BROTHER GOMEZ IS NATURED A CERTAIN WAY. BROTHER JOHN CARLOS ON AND ON. BUT GOD'S GOING TO DEAL WITH US &gt;&gt; IN OUR own way. &gt;&gt; And if we can see that, what love is that? &gt;&gt; What condenses? I know he CAME DOWN AND BECAME ONE OF US, BUT HE still is manifesting himself as a servant, &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; to you and I and to our needs to minister to us. You know, when we can see that, you know what that does? That accumulates faith. &gt;&gt; There's a love that you you see you pick up in that that accumulates faith. It's not a faith that you walk as though that oh, I've got everything under control, but it's a faith that you realize and you're resting in his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God, this is all his workmanship in that accumulation of a godly confidence in our lives. There's places he brings us to now and brings us to things within our lives right now. I know. I know. Like I said, I felt like when God got a hold of my life, I felt like boom, man. I'm rapture ready. &gt;&gt; I'm ready. I'm ready to go, you know, and I don't think you should, you know, you should joy. As I said, you enjoy your salvation. But then God begins to bring you along and begin to look back and you as he's working in your life, you begin to realize, oh Lord, oh my. But als those moments are very necessary also &gt;&gt; because you know why humility allows him to move. &gt;&gt; He's not interested in shaming us. He's interested in that there would be an accumulation of godly confidence &gt;&gt; because we're looking for the rapture &gt;&gt; we're looking for the rapture. Do you love him? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's just stand and have a word of prayer. Hallelujah. Maybe we could just just pray for let's pray for one another because certainly every one of us are we are in journey and I know I may ask this a lot but I believe we're always in God's will as we're praying for one another. God would just continue to build and Lord laying his word and and help us to be help us to be sensitive to that Lord. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we are so thankful, dear God, as we can look into your word and just to see your love and your care that you have to us, Lord. Oh, Father, within these two places, Lord, of faith and and love, God, how it works together to bring a real confidence. Lord, I know that even as Lord God, throughout this congregation, there's many things at times, Lord, that we've prayed for and maybe it didn't come or go the way that we were looking for it. But I thank oh God of how that is there is a confidence that Lord that has has kept throughout the whole time. Lord I can also remember as a young boy when we were gathered over there on Gary Avenue. I remember I still remember that service Lord where that that lady got right up out of that wheelchair. I remember that service as a just a boy. That's the last time we ever saw her. Lord, I don't I don't fault them for that. I know, Lord. There's those that come for the fishes and loaves, but maybe they just weren't ordained, Lord. But father, how how is it when I think of little Edith Wright and I think of Lord even the prophet would point out of that sister in that wheelchair. He would speak of it in I believe it's power transformation refer to it in that first message of the oddball and he said we've prayed but don't know why that God has not healed her as of yet but he spoke these words and I never forgot about it. You said what a beautiful character that she has. Lord, it certainly is all in your hands. And even in those settings, we know, Lord, there is absolutely nothing impossible with you. And if we're believers, your prophet told us in spiritual food and due season, he said, "Then you as a believer, there's nothing impossible with you either." that Lord, we also we're aware that God, you're going to have testimonies that are going to stand there and say, "I looked for my healing, but I never received it on this side." But they stood faithful &gt;&gt; to you, Lord, because there was a love that carried him beyond any lack of understanding. love that would take a hold of faith by the hand and say, "I I don't understand. I've we've prayed for this and prayed for maybe our little girl or prayed for a boy or this or that and and how things have went." And yet, Lord, we know that even within daily living, there's a faith just daily living, Lord, of daily striving. Even right here tonight, we would never never equate ourselves with the martyrs. Never. But yet, Father, your prophet would tell us we're living in a more deceitful age. He said, because back then they could, they knew their enemy. He said, but right now it's such a deception. It's come under the name of church and religion. and how that Satan so subtly would like to just take from the people of God the great riches and treasures that God that you have for us and what you've delivered to us. Father, I pray for each and every one of my brothers and sisters tonight. Dear God, may our roots go deeper in you. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Give us strength, Lord, if you Lord, as you send the mountaintop experiences, let our hearts be captured. Let God the preparation move in our lives that God will anchor us &gt;&gt; in the valley &gt;&gt; to bring forth fruit. Oh father, may the Lord God the faith and love just Lord growing Lord in our lives just knowing Lord there's a lot of times it's just not us sitting around. It don't grow just by sitting around and and listening. Yet faith does come by the word. But it's where many of these things, Lord, it also is coupled together through experiences, through situations that you permit in your infinite wisdom to come our way. even Lord through some of our poor decisions. But help us. Help us, Lord, perfect what's lacking, Lord, in our faith. Make us, Lord, as Paul wrote there in that first epistle to the Thessalonans. But Lord, make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, even as we do toward you. Father, I pray, grant that, Lord God, for our assembly, Lord. Grant, Lord, not only our assembly, but Lord, the bride around the world, oh God, how that Lord, the enemy is just, dear God, always was always working to try to break confidence in the word and trying to bring division. Sometimes, Lord, it's not even recognized in that way. But help us, Lord, help us to be sensitive. And not only that, but help us Lord to look beyond. And Lord Jesus to look to you in all things. Cuz sometimes the things that you allow us to see, I wonder if you're not looking and testing to see what our attitude's going to be towards it. Are we going to go and talk about how wrong they are? at least to what we feel how wrong they are. Or are we going to take it to you in prayer? &gt;&gt; Lord God, help us. I pray &gt;&gt; make us, Lord, if Paul could write that to that church, that's to our lives as well. Make us to, Lord, increase and abound in love one toward another. Father, even right here, God, among the young people, among, Lord, every age, oh God. Lord, how I thank you, dear God. Oh, I've got, Lord God, I've got friends, Lord. I've got great friends in other other places, Lord. But, Father, you didn't call me to pastor in other places. I've got good friends, but right here, right here, this is my family. Not just my natural family, but God, this is that portion that Father, you've put in my heart to care for, to pray for these needs. And Lord, I don't believe you didn't just do that here. That's not just in my heart, but Father, in the hearts of your children. &gt;&gt; Dear God, help us, Lord. Make us to increase, Lord. &gt;&gt; May the Holy Spirit, oh God, just so teach us. Help us, Lord, through every circumstance. It always isn't pleasant, but Father, may we always be sensitive to your teaching, knowing that God, you're there wanting to perfect us. Help us, Lord. Make us more like you. May there be God. I pray even in this year. May our lives may there be more of an accumulation of godly confidence and emptying out of other things and accumulating the right things. Lord God, I want to make more room. I want to empty up. Lord God, guide us. Direct us. If there's things, Lord, that we're holding on to, maybe it's things that we know of. Lord God, may we ask you for grace and say, "Lord, I want to let go of that. I don't want to carry that no more. I don't want to I don't want to have that part of this of my life reserved for that. I want to let it go. Grant it, Lord. Give me grace. Help us, Lord. I pray &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Give me a heart that's filled with love. Oh, and make me more like. Oh Jesus, make me more. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Jesus, make me more like thee. Oh, and give me a heart that's filled with love. &gt;&gt; Make me more like. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord Jesus. Yes, Lord. The &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus, make me more like thee. Give me a heart that's filled with love and grace. Make me more like thee. Make me more like thee. Oh Jesus, make me more like thee. Jesus, make me like thee. Lord, give me a heart that's filled with love and make me more thy Lord. Give me a heart that's filled with your love and may be more. I want to live the way he wants me to live. I want to give until there's just no more to give. I want to love till there's just no more love. I could never ever love my Lord. Oh, I want to live the way he wants me to live. I want to give until there's just no more to give. I want to love to more love. I can never ever I want to live. I want to live away. He wants me to live. I want to give until there is just no more to give. I want to love love to be there is just so love but I can never ever love. I want to love until there is just no more. I could never ever create in me a clean heart. Oh God, let renew a right spirit within me. Create in me. Oh create me a clean heart. Oh God, &gt;&gt; and renew a right spirit within me.
