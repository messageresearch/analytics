precious faith amen you love the Lord this morning amen amen I know we have God bless you have some visitors god bless you certainly welcome you this morning and we have different ones that are out sickness and then some are also on vacation some different things but we're so grateful to have brother Jia Vaughn Prakash here with us and the Javan Prakash is no he's no stranger among us you know when you get to looking at it you you realize how much time has passed by when brother Jia Vaughn can point out he said when I first met you your daddy your family it was that Greece age so you know it says a lot of times past you know and under the bridge that's 30-some years ago it's like 30 33 33 years ago or so you know but God has been so good to us and we just think the Lord you know for what the Lord is doing you know it sometimes we can only see what we are aware of right here and I believe that we need to expect God to move in our midst and in our lives and we must see that but yet to see that it's the same God sovereignly working throughout his bride his people that he has called for his namesake throughout the world it's a sovereign work of God that's not the ingenuity of man you know it's amazing when you you talk sometimes to those from other places and you know from other things of organizations and things like that and they wonder how in the world is this done well it's simple it's God it's it's not it's not our worry it's just a burden that he's placed on her heart to dedicate our lives to him and it's in his control whatever part that were to play do you realize in a puzzle how many of you have ever put together a puzzle I'm not gonna ask you if you completed it but I you know you you might have been there to kind of see it and you look at it that you know you started looking for pieces there's certain things that you start looking at and one of the first things that you start with on a puzzle is what the border and say God Himself set the border for our life he set the border the parameters in Christ and every piece and every part every piece has a significant partner you can take if there is a missing of one piece on a puzzle and you've labored to put that puzzle together you can look at that puzzle and say oh it's beautiful but just that one piece so you see every piece is important its Christ in you that I need its Christ in me you need we need one another as a body and the body itself is the very reflection of the Lord Jesus Christ because he is the perfect and complete thought of God and we are a part of that thought of him and so every little part is significant to think of it if not for Christ within you my life would be incomplete so as a body we need one another and the purpose is is that he might receive all the glory in the beautiful how God has put his economy together it's just it's so wonderful how God has arranged these things and this morning we want to take up the the mission offering as we're preparing to turn the service to to brother Javon this morning and he has some things to show you and we just can't wait to not only to look at that and to see the work that's going on over there but also that to hear the word of the Lord that's what we've come today how many believe God has something special for you I believe that with all my heart you know I heard somebody say it like this you know there's times that meals were being cooked you know there's times when my mom cooked meals before I went to college and there's some of them Mills you know I just didn't value I looked at all no not meatloaf again carrots you know but one but you know what it was regardless she was thinking of my needs so there was meals being prepared now sometimes now it's different I asked my wife honey what's for dinner tonight then I didn't ask so much now I'll ask but you see what it is is even when I didn't ask she was still mindful and she's still prepared aren't you glad that God is mindful aren't you glad he's mindful of our needs no matter in the midst of everything he's been preparing just what we have need of amen god bless you this morning Heavenly Father Lord as we Lord plan to lift here this Lord a mission offering or God this morning Lord we ask that God that you were just so richly and abundantly or God blessed the hearts of your people Lord as they lay aside and sacrifice for Lord we realized though we might be from different places and different continents and things sometimes that we cannot always see and do not always hear but yet father we have this confidence that our desire and our hearts longing in the Lord is for your coming and Lord to see that your kingdom father would be furthered in the hearts of your people until Lord this world receives Lord it's change we are raptured from here Lord Oh God to that great wedding supper law were many of the soldiers or God we will set down Lord across that which has been prepared for us Lord and then to think Lord here we will turn oh God in that millennium Lord to reign and rule with you Lord for a thousand-year honeymoon and then Lord the future home Oh father what glorious things Lord await us Lord so has people of expectation Lord oh god we are expecting this morning Lord because we know that God you are continuing Lord your work in us Lord and father until that moment Lord of the climax of the rapture the change of our bodies Lord we desire Lord to keep pressing Lord so lord may you guide indirect Lord these the offering Lord this morning may you multiply it Oh God Lord according to the needs of your children we pray father Lord we ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for your glory amen amen god bless you this morning village Yvonne I'm going this these voltages we'll put

you know after that you know the country was divided and the Pakistan was in India Bangladesh was in India you know and after they left you know the country was divided as and today you know Pakistan is number one enemy to us you know the country of India but anyhow you know there are a lot of Christians even in Pakistan rhesus brothers and sisters you know and pray for them also you know and so India is one of the oldest country upon this earth if you read in the book of Esther it's mention about India King Ahasuerus was ruling 127 provinces that was from India to Ethiopia majority goes to hitlerism 85% believes in Hinduism second majority goes to Muslims Islamic people and the third majority goes to Christians only five percent Christians and majorly goes to Catholics and very few genuine Christians but still the Indian government is not happy with the Christians by 2021 22 they want to wipe out Christianity in India and change the name of India to Hindustan you know like Pakistan Afghanistan you know so they want to do that and they are very serious about that you know and recently the arrest of two of our pastors and put them into prison and I'm sorry to say you know I am proud to be an Indian but our country is founded on the bride being our ibe bride you know unless you pay a bribe you will be same place you know you have no chance to go up or you know or you know take care of your jobs so everywhere we have to pay bribe and anyhow you know we we have to pray a paper I've you know to bring those preachers out you know and so there was no help by His grace you know I want to thank you know and so pray for the ministry in India and I know I come from a very poor family and I know what is hunger being I know what his power demeans you know and God helped me in 1982 we started with ten orphaned children ten orphaned children I told brother Sam God blessed me with a good job in pharmaceutical company in Bombay and that's the place you know and still we were staying in a small place in in hurts in a you know very small like a very poor place and no battle in the house but in like children ten by ten ten by fifteen square feet you know me and my wife and three children and plus ten orphaned children you know I'm telling this for the glory of God what God has done in our lives and today God blessed us but same time you know we came through lot you know and I know what his power demons I know what his hunger means you know and that's the reason God helped me you know to study started orphanage with ten children and today we have you know by the research there are 150 orphans boys and girls in three places and also we have old aged 50 and we have 200 lepers you will find the majority of the third world countries in every third world country you will find lepers we don't find lepers here you know I am coming since 235 years I never found one will ever hear but you know the the leprosy you know from the third world countries you know sixty

I already said here a few times you know and so maybe there are some new people you know they don't know but you know I come from you know Hinduism idol worshiper I was an idol worshipper believing in many gods and goddesses and one day God spoke to me God sent somebody told me about to make it shot God send somebody you know and I heard the gospel I believed the gospel I was dying on deathbed I

there in South Africa you know and he's also there now so people call him late Nelson Mandela or late president but precious brothers and sisters I want to tell you today 2018 years back Jesus Christ died on the cross of Calvary but not even a devil called him led Jesus or let Christ we are not worshipping the Jesus Christ there once if in the Living God is the Alpha and Omega is the king of kings and Lord of lords is the creator of heaven and earth praise the name of the Lord nobody like him hallelujah if you are worshiping the Lord Jesus you are not worshiping the late Jesus Christ you are worshiping God who is alive praise the name of the Lord hallelujah oh praise the name of the Lord hallelujah what a blessed people we are we are the children of the Living God praise the name of the Lord hallelujah recently I met one Muslim man you know in one of the restaurant I introduced myself I'm a Christian pastor in a minister you know and the missionary and he was a it was a strong Muslim man and he was he was I don't believe Jesus Christ died on the cross I said you don't believe that he said no way he married Mary Magdalene and he was in Kashmir in India you know and his you know his people are living there his children grandchildren they're living I said brother what to say you know Muslims are hard nuts you can't change them unless is used by the Almighty God you know and in India it is very hard to convert Muslims you know to Christ you know but I heard recently you know in Pakistan there are a lot of Christians you know converted from Muslims you know but anyhow I'm talking about India you know India over there afraid of their religion they're afraid of their community you know and there was occasions you know and one young lady you know two young ladies one was a Christian and she was sharing about Jesus Christ to the another young lady who was a Muslim you know and she accepted Christ and you know the parents killed both of them her brothers killed you know both of them so this day you know it's dangerous you know but thing is this you know if they are chosen by God if they're called out by God only it's possible otherwise they're hard nuts you know we can't change them except God you know so this is brothers and sisters you know coming of the Lord is very near and today you know this present government is acting like a you know King the number catalyser you know at the time of Shadrach Meshach and Abednego they are forcing you know to come back to Hinduism and maybe I told you last time you know it was the news in the newspaper if myself if I accept it is if I accept the the Hindu gods or Hinduism I'll get $10,000 cash in my hand anyhow that is not going to help me because I am NOT a nominal Christian I am NOT a hidden I am not in a denomination man I am the child of the Living God praise the name of the Lord hallelujah where there is ten thousand dollars or ten million dollars that's not going to change me brother Sam that's not going to change me you know and then another in the newspaper they said if a Muslim man if II accept the Hinduism he or she will get every individual get fifteen thousand US dollars you know I don't want to talk about others but you know thank God you know because I'm the child of the Living God thank God I am no more hidden worshipper thank God I am the child of the Living God praise the name of

telling this for the glory of God there's the name of the Lord so this morning time I would like to share with you about the complete obedience to God complete obedience to God now God came you know this Abraham and Sarah they were old and God promised them they will have a son you know and you know and you know about Isaac they waited for 25 years they waited to have one son 25 years now he's a human being we want everything quick quick quick but they waited for 25 years my precious brother prays the brothers and sisters you know and after 25 years God blessed her with one son Isaac he was hundred she was 19 you know but God changed her I'm a goddess living is a living God is alive he's not like other gods after 25 years when he was hundred when she was ninety God prepared them to have a child which was impossible which was impossible he couldn't in human history but thank God that's why I said we are serving the Living God yesterday today and forever is the same girl never changes he's the creator of heaven and earth - the people are making him turn God second God Father Son and the Holy Ghost oh they are not three they are not two you know when you believe in Trinity like the prophet of God said Trinity came from the bottomless pit when you believe that Trinity when you believe in two guards or three guards I want to tell you as a man of God you're a worse than a heathen because the heathens they believe in many cars but the Bible said praise the name of the Lord since the prophet of God came into this world you know we opened the Bible the Bible is we can understand there are many great people they couldn't understand the Bible but today by the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ through Malachi 4 5 and 6 we can understand the Bible very well if you read the Bible every day if you pray go to your knees God is not going to hide anything from you because we are is bride we are his wife praise the name of the Lord hallelujah you know the Catholics they say Mary is the Queen of Heaven but today is a man of God I want to tell you I want to declare and I am The Queen of Heaven praise the name of the Lord hallelujah you are the Queen of Heaven you people are the Queen of Heaven praise the name of the Lord because you love the Lord because in the book of Isaiah it says your creator is your husband he's our husband he's going to prepare a place for us our days are numbered sometimes we say that you know the day will the saturn's days are numbered even our days are numbered this is not a public place for us this is not the permanent place for us or we are going to return back to our country very soon praise the name of the Lord hallelujah this world is not suitable for branch of Jesus Christ this world is not suitable for you and me this is the wrong place we are living there strangers they are just strangers they are traveling with Christ Jesus praise the name of the Lord but the time is coming my precious brother senses there is no much time left don't look for another years and years and here's a no sir because in the sight of God the two here two thousand years is just like two days so his coming is not going to turn race tournament we how to have faith in God like Abraham he had a faith you know when God said Abraham behold Here I am and he said take now thy son thine only son Isaac whom thou lovest and get thee into the land of whom Maurya and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountain which I will tell thee off you know when God told him take your only son he could have he could have brought a lot of excuses he could have brought a lot of excuses he could have said Lord Lord all these years people called me as a man of God men of God and if I take my son and kill him you know people will call me the murderer killer Lord I'm not going to do that I'm sorry I'm sorry then you could have told the Lord if I take Isaac and sacrifice him do you think his mother is going to keep quiet he could have told him Lord said I will kill me yeah because no mom is going to keep shut her mouth you know if somebody's taking her child you know her baby you know work effort for sacrificing no mommy's going to keep quiet if any mom is giving quite that means maybe she she's a stepmother or maybe she's a different person you know but the real mother of child she will never keep quiet no no no I believe you know brother Sam maybe I'm wrong you know I think you abraham maybe he didn't tell his wife if you were not told you know I'm taking Isaac to sacrifice him he said no way no way you can't do that he's my triangle precious brothers and sisters but what happened this man of God he was a complete obedient man to God he kept first God in his life praise the name of the Lord so on the third day here the Bible says you know on the third day oh my and Abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his ass and took took two of his young men with him and Isaac his son and claimed the wood for the burnt offering and rose up and went unto the place of which God had told him then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place of our afar off and Abraham said unto Him his young man a mighty here with the ass I and the lad will go yonder and worship and come again to you what a great faith what a great faith precious brothers and sisters today we need faith without faith it is impossible to please God without faith we cannot live such sensible life in this world without faith we are not Christians without faith there is no way going into the rapture without faith you cannot go into the kingdom of God without faith you can't be a Christian of course there are many Christians in the world you know whole world the majority of Christians are more than windows Eden's you know but those kind of Christians you know we are not those kind of Christians thank God for His grace and mercy today we need to pray for the Christians in this world you know they need Christ they need revelation thank God for the revelation of Jesus Christ thank God for the message of the other to the bill thank God for the profiting of a generation thank God for the molokai four five and six praise the name of the Lord hallelujah we are a blessed people with the revelation of Jesus Christ and that is why today you are here race tournament there are millions millions of Christians in this world they don't know about Christ only for the namesake you know they have a cross here you know they claim the Christians and they have Christian names they claim they're Christians but you know according to Scripture you know the people who have Christ here if we have Christ here young brothers young sisters children even though you are born in a Christian family you need Christ you you need to believe in God you need to have faith in God you need to repent of your sins you need to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ according to X 2:38 there are many baptisms in this world but that's not going to help you there is only one true Living God and his name is Lord Jesus Christ in the name of Jesus Christ praise the name of the Lord that's the true baptism then you have to be filled with the Holy Spirit that's very important without the Holy Spirit there's no way going into a kingdom of God without a Holy Spirit there's no victory for you and you can't be a Christian without the Holy Ghost today we need Holy Ghost precious brothers and sisters anyhow this man was a man who was completely obedient to God are we obedient to God today do you have Jesus Christ you gave first preference in your life today that's a hard job you know that you know that's a hard job you know to give first preference to God in your life but today if you're a child of God you are a people of God if you have the revelation of Jesus Christ you must have Jesus Christ your first preference in your life the precious brothers and sisters you know that's very important this man Abraham he got a first preference for God in his life then everything after God everything after God I told Sam you know coming from the air but I said you are you're my guy but you are the second guide you

beach california priestesses then god was so pleased with complete obedience God had tried his patriarch a brown was a great patriarch president a Muslim and there was a trial period for Abraham he had tried his servant and every son that cometh to God must be what tried tested if you are a true child of God you will be tried if you if you are a true child of God God will just in you like we parents you know we want our children to walk in the in the will of God you know sometimes sometimes we have to test on them you know if they are not chastening your children something's wrong with you we need to teach them the way of God we need to teach them how to walk with Jesus Christ with God we have to teach them how to read the Word of God we have to teach them how to you know walk in

they all love the Lord praise the name of the Lord hallelujah I thank God for His grace and mercy but anyhow every child who comes to God there is a Nobel in the Bible without any problems without any trials was there no you will never find nobody in the Bible everybody went through trials and God was chastening to get right with God praise the name of the Lord hallelujah that's where that many following when the trial comes many far away God must be what pride chastened so yeah like wheat we Cheston our children God does that they that were that many follow me because we can't stand at trial person come to the altar in time of the revival and you will watch just little while and the hot trials began to come Jesus plainly taught it said the sower went forth sowing seed some fell by the wayside some fell into strana ground and among stones and thistles and the others fell over the good ground and he said that's the way the world went goes out some here's the word go out everybody here's the world you know but sometimes when they go out you know birds come along and pick it up see they don't do no good at all they are examine our lives today this is brothers and sisters you know what kind of seed we are mmm praise the name of the Lord hallelujah and some here's the word and go out and birds coming along and pick it up and see they don't they don't do no good at all I just come up overnight oh they were going to do great things but when the trials began to come it shocks them down but some goes all the way over into the good ground and that brings forth a hundredfold that's why the Abraham was you know hundredfold he was a believer he was believing in God praise the name of the Lord hallelujah and he put God first in his life and that's what we need to do today praise the name of the Lord Abraham was old also he was like a human being like you and me he never he never fell down from heaven huh he was also human really like you and me he was he went through lot you know but still he was standing with God still he was having faith in God even though he was going to so many trials and problems nothing could change him because he was chosen of God he was called out it was predestination and that's what we are press the name of the Lord you are predestinated you are chosen you are called out you are sealed the prophet of God said in one of the message God already sealed his people we need to trust in the Lord and walk with God praise the name of the Lord let God help us every patriarch every child of God it was obedient there is the name of the Lord oh my then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place afar off an abra ham said unto his young man abiding here with ash I and the lad will go yonder and worship and come again to you what a great faith precious person sister today we need great faith he talked many times about the faith but a lot of people they don't have the faith we need faith today trust in the Lord believe in the Lord with our whole heart praise the name of the Lord hallelujah huh he said and come again to you he said he never said I will I will come you know he said the boat are going and after worshiping the Lord you come back praise the name of the Lord and Abraham took the wood and the burnt offering and laid it upon Isaac his son and it took the fire in the in his hand and the knife and they went both of them together together you know this many little little little little wood it's not going to burn the body of Isaac in India you know weak you know Hinduism believes in burning the body you know and they have lot of wood sometime you know you know 110 - tons you know because - you know - burn the body little little you know little wood is not going to help now the Bible says he let the wood on Isaac you know how heavy it was how much heavy it was because the little words it's not going to burn him not Abraham knows that you see you know there must be you know lot of heavy wood he let it on no children if you are in a place of Isaac what do you say you are daddy what kind of man you are you don't have mercy on me how can I take this big load of wouldn't and

have warned his dad what are you doing are you senseless this is true too heavy do you think I'm animal but he could have said that but he was dedicated his life to God today young people need to dedicate their lives to God today we all need to dedicate our lives to God and be obedient to God obedient of parents obedient to the elders this boy and even though he was a strong the Prophet said he was 15 years old young man he was not a little baby but he called he could have spoke bad you know to his dad you could have insulted him he could have talked you know but he was obedient child praise the name of the same message I was preaching in one of the church in Kentucky few years back I want to share this dad and son son was sitting here in the front dad was sitting there deciding

said Behold the fire and the wood but where is the lamb for a burnt offering it was it says Abraham said my son God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they went both of them together both of them together and in that church the Sun you know you know God spoke to father and son because there were ten years they were not talking to each other for 10 years and that's where dad was

he's studying you know the daughter will come and child she was five years old and you know and every time she comes and trouble then what is this dad what is this then what should I do that was that dad what he thought he was having a world map in his office and he knows that she's going to you know ask questions and she won't give me time to study you know under little children they don't know anything you see and he got the world map I don't have world map you know but uh you know yeah he what the world map and turned it into pieces many pieces many pieces and he called his daughter sweetie come here honey even married to small small pieces and gave it to her okay this is a world map I'm giving it to you you know and you you put it together he knows that he's not going to do that

that this is your world map that was shocked honey how you you are not expert in geography have you did this and with smile on the her first face that you know that there was a map of there was a picture of Jesus Christ behind the map [Applause] there was a picture of Jesus Christ on the map that helped me to put it together oh that was his sermon you know next day he was so happy you know Oh precious brothers and sisters you know god is great oh my god is great praise the name of the Lord today we need Christ in our life just place Jesus in his right place and your life will be in order if we can place Jesus Christ in first place and that will keep your life in order a lot of people that don't have Christ in their life so it is hard for them to you know walk in his footsteps but today if we can have Jesus Christ not into our knowledge not into our mind brain but we need Christ here in our heart praise the name of the Lord lot of people say I'm in the I'm in the message I mean I'm in the message are you in the message that's a good thing to be the message but do you have message in your life praise the name of the Lord today we need message what is message Jesus Christ is the message lot of people the talk against the message a lot of people that try to find mistakes with the Prophet a lot of people they try to find mistakes with the message but precious brothers and sisters it's dangerous first thing you know of course there are so many preachers you know great preachers they preached on the pulpit for thirty years forty years you know twenty years but today they are no more because they speak against the Prophet they try to find mistakes with the Prophet of course prophet was a man he's a human being you know everybody makes a mistake nobody's perfect now people are taking the the place of God and try to judge others in a lighter way it is dangerous to touch the anointed of God as far as I know the prophet of God he has done great things while he was walking on this earth and he never harmed anybody nobody can stand and say oh brother branham didn't come to me no he never harmed anybody he was the humblest person upon this earth so if you talk against him God is not happy you're in Vegas place so many people try to find mistakes with the message and the talk against the message but today I want to tell you the men of God this message is a nothing to do with William Marion Branham this message belongs to the Holy Ghost when you try to find a mis-text with the message message is nothing but it's the Word of God and the Holy Ghost when you talk about against the Holy Ghost message you are talking against the Holy Ghost there is no forgiveness here or there that's what the Bible says don't speak against the Holy Ghost don't speak against the men of God whose anointed of God don't take God's place don't be judged we are not judges what we are by His grace we need to pray for others very easily they talk against the men of God and I did of God they don't understand they're in a dangerous place let God help us my precious brothers and sisters oh my let us have Christ in our life it was obedience to God sure you know they want they went together and they came to a place where God had told him and Abraham built an altar there and let the wood in order and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood oh my god young man fifteen years old young man you know you could have attacked his dad but when Abraham was binding him you know he was like a lamb he never said a word to his dad that why you're doing this to me and why you want to kill me while you're doing this to that you know he never said anything he was like a damn good lamb he became a lamb you know pressure brothers and sisters I'm trying I'm traveling in this country's Western countries in the United States and America in in in Canada in Europe and many places God gave me opportunity to visit them you know you know I'm sorry to say you know I have seen so many lions and God is not happy with the Lions he's happy with the Lambs we need to become lambs we need to become dowse God loves the Lambs that's the reason the Almighty God left his throne glorious throne he came to this world as the Lamb of God he took your place and my present and the people in the world he died on the cross of Calvary he sacrificed his body on the cross of Calvary it was the Almighty God creator of heaven and earth nobody can kill him sometimes we say oh the wrong wrong killed him or you know but you know Jews are Israelite in heresies and services he is the Almighty God you know he gave his life for you and me nobody could have touched him but he dedicated his life he came to fulfill the scripture he died on the cross for you and for me he was buried and third day rose again 40 days he was upon this earth after resurrection and fortieth day is gone intuition she ascended into heaven and 50th day he came back to us through the Holy Spirit and is in our lives today he's in our heart today praise the name of the Lord hallelujah thank God for this wonderful church wonder place wonderful place Tabernacle that we all God gave us to all we can come and worship the Lord and sit here and this can protect us from the rain this can protect us from the you know winter this L can protect us from the Sun thank God for this wonderful tabernacle but his grace and mercy page that I want to know but we have Jesus Christ in our life in our heart we are the real temple of God you are the genuine temple of God anyhow here time is running almost one o'clock I'm closing it now I I believe in time I always take 45 minutes one over but because of that you know so it took a little more time I'm sorry about that you know anyhow so here in message called paradox prophet Christian 62 he says Abraham when he was on top of the mountain with his only child only child oh my god waited for 25 years only child Oh Abraham Sarah loved him like anything you know and brought him up you know and you know took care of him you know for everything only child one day God comes and says Abraham take your child take your son and and and you know sacrifice anyhow he waited for 25 years he had waited for 25 years to get the child and then when the child was about 14 years old sorry 14 years old I said 15 God told him what is what was he doing this for now to confirm that God keeps his word no matter how is unreasonable it seems he still can perform and make a paradox he said take this little 14 years old boy of yours take him up on the mountain and offer him up for a sacrifice and he took him up under the mountain he was a man of faith Abraham was a great hero faith he knows what God told him before he gave Isaac to him he said can you come can you count the sand on the ocean he said no Lord not possible I will make your like a sand your generation praise the name of the Lord hallelujah Abraham knows you know even though he sacrifice it God is going to raise him he knows that and that's the reason he never cushion God he was not Oh an obedient to God praise the name of the Lord here knowledge system and now if that him being then about a hundred and fifteen years old I Brown was 115 years old waited 25 years on the boy and here the boy and he was going to destroy the only evidence he has of seeing this promise of God to the father of the nation's ever taking place and then he asked to destroy that that the reason he called the place Jehovah Jarrah but when he was just about ready to fall on line with the complete obedience and the holy go holy spirit caught his hand maybe there was a knife in his hand you know to kill ice and the prophet of God said ready to fall in line with the complete obedience to God the Holy Ghost the Holy Spirit came caught his hand and Ram britta'd behind him hooked by its cones in the wilderness what was it a paradox he was he was trying to you know you know sacrifice him you know that maybe the Holy Ghost chemical and only desire maybe Ibraham is doing Princeton you know the story what I'm talking about here now you may be you heard many times you know many maybe you read the Bible you know praise the name of the Lord hallelujah is Jehovah Jireh he's the great provider is the king of kings and Lord of lords is the mighty God understand each and everything in your
