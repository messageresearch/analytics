========================================

and Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob the heirs with him of the same promise for he looked and maybe seen Abraham was not looking for the Promised Land neither was Isaac or Jacob Abraham sojourned in the land of promise Isaac was born in the land of promise Jacob was born in the land of promise amen god bless you buddy and so he wasn't looking Abraham he was looking for a city it said whose builder and maker is God what Abraham was looking for was heaven man the promised land brother Brennan told us type the Holy Spirit well that wasn't what he was looking for he was looking for heaven turned me to Philippians three verses 2021 or our conversation is in heaven from whence also we look for the Saviour the Lord Jesus Christ who shall change our vile bodies that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body can save man according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself so if Abraham was looking for heaven where is heaven Abraham wasn't looking out into the Stars he wasn't looking out into space Abraham the Bible said was sojourn in the land of promise and he was looking for heaven first thing I want to say Evan is a real place turn me to John chapter 14 I want to read verses 1 through 3 here's the words that Jesus spoke on the night before he was crucified and he says let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there you may be also so twice in three verses Jesus calls heaven a place and he means that when he says my father's house he's talking about heaven and what he means is it's just as real as any place that you could think of here on earth it's as real as the place that you call home it's a real place filled with real people now when the people pass from this life they die as we say they pass away or are asleep in Christ then they pass into another dimension a dimension of immortals and they don't pass into a place where there's houses of brick and mortar and paint and all these things but what he's talking about when he says in my father's house he's talking about another body where the scripture says that if the earthly tabernacle be dissolved we have one waiting and so the place that you go is more of a condition it's a body changes it's changing and that's where they go before they return and are raised from the dead a house not made with hands is what Paul says in 2nd Corinthians it's a body heaven we know is the dwelling place of God I'm gonna refer to many scriptures and to save time I'm just going to read them to you and I won't I won't give you time to turn to Rose it it'll take us a while to get through it otherwise I've had many scriptures here before me but Matthew 18 and 10 it says take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones for I saying to you that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my father which is in heaven amen so that's where the father is is in heaven and the angels that are the guardian angels they always behold the face of the Father the throne of God is in heaven in Matthew 34 5 and 34 it says but I saying do you swear not neither by heaven for it is God's throne in acts 7 48 49 it says howbeit the Most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands as saith the Prophet heaven is my throne and earth is my footstool what house will you build me saith the Lord or what is the place of my rest Hebrews 8:1 says now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum we have such an high priest whose is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven and from what we read earlier from flippy ins three-and-twenty we see our citizenship is from heaven Abraham journeyed as a pilgrim and a stranger and that's what we are here we're living in this realm but we're not of this realm the bodies that we inhabit are of this realm and but but we're not of this realm and we're waiting for the Lord Jesus to come to catch us away the Bible actually hints that heaven is not that far away whether Branham says it directly that heavens not that far away many times people think you to travel to heaven you've got to go way up beyond the sky somewhere but early Christians knew and we can see it by the scriptures that they would immediately when they pass from this life they would immediately pass into heaven or a realm of heaven in the message of Christ revealed his own word brother branham says you're going to find out one of these days that when you go to heaven you don't fly off somewhere else you're right here you're still right here - just in another dimension faster than this right through this room is coming color every color shirt dress whatever you got on is eternal laying right on the records going around and around the world every time you bat your eyes it's right on record watch television will prove that brother batam says when a person is born there is a record put on to record that person's life and he says at first there's not much sound but then as you grow then it becomes things you spoke things you do and as you come into the age of accountability then there's a recording of that and brother Graham said then when a person dies that tape gets put into God's library and then when the judgement comes that tape will be pulled out and played everything that was ever said everything that was ever done he said everything you ever thought but thank God for the blood of Jesus Christ that cleanses and erases anything as we seen Thursday night from all of our mistakes all of our faults our sins our failures will be erased by the blood of Jesus Christ I wouldn't want to stand there on that day without that but the rhythm says in one place he was afraid not knowing what heaven exactly was he was afraid at first he didn't want to just be a spirit floating around he said he wanted to be a man all the time wherever he was and then he had a vision one morning he woke up in bed and he had a vision and he said he in that vision he says I went to another dimension somewhere and he says when we leave this body were not spirits God's got another type of body where we're just as real as we are here Paul tells us something amazing about the gospel and what it's done for us in Hebrews 12 22 through 24 he says but we ye are coming to Mount Zion unto the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem to an innumerable company of angels to the General Assembly of the Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to God the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect and to Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel Paul is comparing Mount Sinai to Mount Zion and in the time we know of Moses Moses would go on Mount Sinai to get into the presence of God and to hear from God and remember one time that the children of Israel said they wanted God to speak directly to them and so they draw near and to Mount Sinai and it talks about there being thunderings and lightnings and earth shaking and they they were fearful and they said no let God speak to you Moses and then you just come tell us what he said had to say but in this verses that we read the writer or Paul uses a Greek word that means to come near or to approach closely he uses it several times when he says to an innumerable company of angels to a General Assembly of the Church of the firstborn to the judge of all to the spirits of just men made perfect and he uses this phrase many times and what he's saying but now we're in Christ we are in heavenly realities think of what he's saying heavens not that far away we're not that far from angels we're not that far from love lines we're not that far from God we're not that far from Jesus Christ itself heaven is a real place where Jesus is and it's not far away from us Amen pulses and visions tune one through seven he said you have he quickened who were dead in trespasses sin you say ma'am he's quickened us we were dead in trespasses and sin but we've been quickened what is it that that seed of God that we you were born with that was on the inside of you has been quickened and brought to life we're waiting for a quickening of this body we're in time passed she walked according to the course of this world according to the Prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation in time past in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh another mind and we're by nature the children of Wrath even as others but God who is rich in mercy amen for his great love we're in he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by grace ye are saved and has raised us up together and made us to sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of His grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus pardon me in second Corinthians twelve verses two through four Paul speaks about the third heaven and says he was caught up into paradise and heard unspeakable words which were not lawful for man to utter into the third heaven so what we're looking at there are realms of heaven there are different dimensions we here on earth on we're in this mortal realm but there are dimensions that are below us I don't mean into the earth but I mean on us God scale there are dimensions going this way and there's dimensions going that way and we live in in between in them in among dimension of mortals now in that dimension you take there's a great conglomerate of blackness and gaiety and muck and sin and divisions of the world but all at once you might see a light somewhere brother madam said that light that you see in the mists of that darkness is a Christian in the midst of all the darkness in this mortal realm he says you'll see a light here and there and that is the Christian but men that are in this realm they are influenced by these other realms they're glowing this way brother Branham says there's the round the first realm is the realm of the dead the Unruh generated man lost unjust souls of men and then the dimension beyond that he says this dimension of demons and then the dimension beyond that is the dimension of hell going the other way you have the first dimension of the saved of those that are under the blood of Jesus Christ who died and who will rise again beyond that you have the next dimension which brother Branham said was the dimension of angels and then the next dimension above that he says is the third heaven where God is he says men that are here in this mortal realm they're affected by one dimension or the other he said this side comes from God that side comes from the devil and it affects mortal beings in this realm and he says those that are in darkness are influenced from beneath and those that are the lights are influenced from above when you leave this earthly dimension you pass one way or the other into a realm of spirits into a realm either of the just or the unjust brother branham spoke about when he was shot and he was dying and he says I was laying there when the doctor done away with me and I felt myself sinking into a dark eternity looked like and I hollered papa Oh Papa helped me there was no Papa there mama helped me there was no mama there all God helped me there was no God there it was just endless horrible old nightmare burning blazing hell would be a pleasure being up beside that and falling on through there I thought oh my over and over like this and I got in a place of smoke and dark and sick and all such a feeling it was death on me and I could see these women coming up to me and they had some kind of painted eyes like that and that was about 40 years ago but I still remember it and they were going ooh ooh ooh and I said am I to be here forever yeah it's just forever he said old God if you'll let me out of here I'll never be ashamed of you again I'll never be ashamed God please give me a chance the first thing you know I felt myself coming back up and the doctor was alarmed because my heart had only beating 17 times to the minute I doesn't let out all my blood and everywhere laying in my own blood where the brand saw the dimensions of the law hell the dimensions of hell talks about when he had moved out to Tucson and his wife went to JC Penney store and she was shopping and he sat down to wait and coming up either escalator was these two women and he said they had paint on their eyes and he said they were talking in another language he believed it was Spanish but when he first heard them and saw them he thought that he was back in that place again hell and I wanted to say from this those individuals were influenced by wonderful side of the dimensions or the other and from what brother branham said he saw we can see what dimensions that influence is strong message of fellowship you said now if you speak of heaven or when we die that we go off someplace where you can't even see can't you see that God has hid the glory from the natural eye we are setting here in heavenly places now the Holy Spirit is here now Christ is here and the body that we receive when we go out of here is here we got we go into another dimension into a blessed place with the Lord Jesus in return and at the return of Christ in his physical body come back to earth he spiritually turned back and picked up a brand-new body that's going to live forever if people can get the ideal right now of angels walking up and down the aisles of Christ the Son of God moving around in the building you're in his presence we are seated in heavenly places heaven is moving around us just in another dimension brother Brown said that's faster than ours the Bible doesn't give a lot of description of heaven but it does give us some images and pictures comparisons to life here on earth Psalms 33:13 said the Lord looketh from heaven acts 1:8 through leaven says but we ever see but we shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and all Judea and into Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth as Jesus talking to the cyclist and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight and while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up behold two men stood by them in white apparel what happened they appeared from that other dimension which also which also said Ye men of Galilee why stand ye gazing into heaven this same Jesus which was taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven he saved man he's going to come in like manner he's coming again Paul says in Philippians 1:21 through 23 for me to live is Christ and to die is gain but if I live in the flesh this is the fruit of my labor yet what I shall choose I want not for I am in a strait between stew having a desire to depart and to be with Christ which is far better Paul says he's caught between the two he's here doing the work for Christ but he longs to leave here and be with Christ so we see the father's house there's a city designed and built by God Hebrews 11 and 16 tells us it's a better country turned me to revelations chapter 21 now I'm going to read a few verses here and I'm going to skip some verses because there's a lot of words of jewels and things that I don't even know of and can't pronounce so if you want later you can go and reread this whole chapter but what I want to look at is the description of the city verse two and I John saw the holy city to New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and I heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of God is with men and he will do well with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain where the former things are passed away they say praise the Lord verse 18 and the building of the wall of it was Jasper and the city was pure gold like in the clear glass verse 21 and the twelve gates were twelve pearls every several gate was of one pearl and the street of the city was pure gold as it were transparent glass and the city had no need of the Sun neither of the moon that's in verse 23 two shining it for the glory of God did lighten it and the lamb is the light thereof verse 25 and the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day for there shall be no night there glory verse 27 and there shall in no wise enter in anything to defile it nor whatsoever worketh abomination or maketh the lie but they which are written in the Lamb's Book of Life now from the Scriptures and from songs that we've heard were all familiar with the the city the streets being paved with gold we've got songs that's a sir so I want you just for a moment before we go on to imagine something imagine that you were a very wealthy person and you possess must riches and you had a lot of gold and let's say that you somehow were able to take that gold with you when you left here you realize when you got to heaven the only thing you would have would be pavement John writes about the cities paved with gold and I don't doubt his words I believe they're literal I believe they're simply him reporting what he saw and but I also believe that it was meant to tell us that something that we here in this slide hold as having great value is going to be used to pave the streets with their it's a city built by God in a great city it will be filled with God's people what would that city be like won't be no pollution the sky will be clear no crime no violence no criminals will ever enter there there won't be no greedy politicians there won't be no drug pushers there won't be no drug users there won't be no child molester there won't be any potholes in this city we won't have to worry about power outages for the lamb is light there revelations 22 verses one through three and he showed me a pure river of water of life clear as crystal proceeding out of the throne of God and of the lamb and in the midst of the street of it on either side of the river there was a tree of life which bare twelve manner of fruits yielded to her fruit every month and the leaves of the trees were for the healing of the nation's this tree spanned the river is what this is saying was this one tree but it says it spanned the river verse three and there shall be no more curse Alleluia right now our bodies every time we look in the mirror testifies of us that we are living under the curse as far as in this physical body this body is subject to the curse that's why we're we die we our bodies is dying as we grow older it gets to a point where our body slows down on the reproduction of cells until eventually it stops but there will be no more curse there'll be no more dying there will be no more sorrow no regret no remorse all bitterness will be gone you got to get rid of that bitterness here you you can't hold on to that all your failures will be left behind suffering will be redeemed and rewarded there won't be any eyeglasses no braces no wheelchair no false teeth no bald heads no hearing aids there won't be any crutches there won't be any need of hospitals there won't be no need of doctors there won't be no more nursing homes because we don't grow old there it's one of the things I tell my oldest daughter all the time I tell her promised me when I get older you will not stick me in a nursing home I I do not like those places they're one of the most sad places on earth you asked me my daughter works in one every day there won't be no need of paramedics nobody's gonna need CPR won't be no aspirin won't need it no Tylenol accidents over cancer utterly obliterate heart attacks won't be any no one grows old and feeble there's another thing you won't find in heaven Cemetery because no one dies no funerals if you make it to that city you'll live forever a man who's in heaven right now well we've said pretty much that already God we know is in heaven the Lord Jesus we know that the Bible tells us there are maryada of angels and I'm sure you know that there's the Angels have different classifications and categories and jobs that they perform and do we can see that clearly by the scripture and I believe that every true believer that has been washed under the blood of Jesus Christ by accepting him as their Savior and filled with the Holy Ghost born again all the born again will be in that first dimension of heaven and when they rise again then those who are alive and remain will be changed and we will have a little time with them here before we pass on into the next dimension to meet Jesus Christ in the air as the Bible says but I wonder what that will be like when they arrive I wonder I know that the born-again believers will see will be able to see the resurrection of the dead they'll be able to see loved ones that's come back but I don't think the world will be able to see and I believe that will be changed into a body that the world won't be able to see oh but you know what it makes me think also those that won't be taped those that will be left here in this dimension of the mortal and will have to go through the three and a half years of tribulation friends I don't want the plan B what if I don't make it I'll make it through the tribulation no sir I don't want a plan B I want to make it a man brother branham spoke about the tribulation and he said cut me open build me full of sulfur and set me on fire but don't let me go through that tribulation telling how horrible that it will be Bride of Christ will be caught away I believe that children who are died before the age of accountability they go to heaven brother branham actually says all babies if they died go to heaven before the age of accountability I'll personally I don't have anything really to back this up so if you think otherwise it's all right it's not something that's going to hurt either one of us but I believe that people that are born with mental disabilities that don't have the ability to be able to understand I believe they're going to be there and be in our right mind because it was being brought into this room into this body something took place before the birth and they were born that way but I don't believe that's the real them no more than I believe you can look at one another and say well I see the real you the real me doesn't look like this I remember what I look like I can't wait to go back I can't wait to be young again well I've got a lot more to say on that second Corinthians five and seven you're nine pardon me where we walk by faith not by sight we are confident I say and willing rather to be absent from the body and present with the Lord wherefore we labour that whether present or absent we may be accepted of him not everybody is gonna make it to heaven the Bible clearly defines there are the same there are the laws there is no in-between category now I want to put this in here where the Branham talks about the elect and he talks about he gives an example of like cutting out a pattern of a dress and he says when you cut it out there is part of that cloth is ordained to be part of the dress but he says there's a remnant and you don't do away with that it still was part of the cloth it just wasn't ordained to be part of the dress and brother branham likens that unto the difference between those that are the elect the Bride of Christ and those that actually have received Jesus as their Savior and are saved remember the foolish virgins they were still virtuous they were saved they just didn't have the Holy Ghost and there's a time when they will come to receive their inheritance but just looking from among the saved and the lost people are either going to spend eternity in heaven or spending eternity in hell my job is not to decide who goes to heaven and who goes to hell I'm in cells not administration but I am sure one thing those that do not accept Jesus as their Savior will not have a chance of being God knows us completely and intimately and what I want to answer was how are we gonna know each other in heaven because we're going to be changed let's say you met someone you've come in and you've just met someone here now and let's say they're in their 70s they're not gonna look like that when they received the body change the how do you get to know you live with your husband and wife yeah in your memory you can have remembering what they look like in that but what you've grown accustomed to is what they look like now on you except that in this nature I'm as being them how you gonna know well one thing's for sure we're not going to no less in heaven than we know here one thing's for sure we're going to no more in heaven than we do here Paul says in first Corinthians 13:12 for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as also I am known Psalms 31 39 verses 1 through 4 Psalm 139 verses one through o Lord thou has searched me and known me thou knowest my down setting and my uprising thou understand that my thought afar off thou compass my path and my lying down and our great and art acquainted with all my ways for there is not a word in my tongue but but lo o Lord thou knowest it all together David is right here God knows us very intimately God we know his word is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart we we have imperfections in this life but those imperfections are going to be removed this life causes us to cover up now not just physically I'm talking about but I'm talking about emotionally many times people cover themselves because of the sin it's over sin will be lifted then we can be ourselves without the imperfections don't shame no embarrassment individual personalities survive into eternity brother Branham says one place says that God takes your personality who you are your makeup and he uses that for his glory God's made you like you are he wanted you to be like you are God didn't just throw the clay there and say well let's just see what comes of it brother Brennan says in one place he said he bred this one to that one and this one to that one and this one to that one until he got the right ting in the bell who you are the way God wanted you to be and when we leave here will still be the way God wanted us to be so the essence of who you are survives into eternity hallelujah just vastly improved by the grace of God I believe well know each other intimately and I take this from the scripture when Peter James and John were on Mount Transfiguration they recognized Moses and Elijah now they didn't recognize them because there had been some paintings of Moses and Elijah that had their likeness down there may have been paintings but who who would know what they looked like years hundreds of years have passed how did they recognize Moses and Elijah they weren't wearing name tags there was something about each one of those men that made it evident of who they were there was something they recognized you realize what was happening was here was a opening of another dimension and here steps out Moses and Elijah and there's still Moses and Elijah brother Brennan says Saul got back slid and God wouldn't answer his prayer and he went to the prophets and the Providence couldn't tell him anything and he went to the Urim and Thummim and there was no lights to flashed across it and so he disguised himself and went to the Witch of Endor and then he asked her to bring up the spirit of of Samuel and when she called him up she bowed down herself and cried I see God's rising from the earth and brother man said Samuel was still a prophet he was still Samuel and Saul recognizing but not only that he knew Saul some people have said Saul was lost Saul was not lost he just back slid but remember Samuel said today you and your son are gonna die in battle and then you're gonna be with me so he couldn't be lost because they were going to be where Samuel was but my real point was Samuel was still a prophet he was still sandal and Elijah and Moses when they stood there on Mount Transfiguration they were still prophets and Moses wasn't an old man like he was when he delivered led the children out of bondage he was a young man again but there was something about him that he was still Moises Alou yeah Peter James and John recognized him even though they had never saw him before I believe I know that will recognize many of you here in this assembly know the testimony of my father and how when he was on the table there before the doctors he rose up out of his body he was taking it to another dimension and said he was trying to see everything and he described how the flowers were they are more beautiful than any flowers did you ever see here in this world and there was many people coming and he was trying to look and see him he said but there was a young man that was standing in front of him and he says every time he would move the look around who said that young man would move over into his line of sight and this went on for a little bit till finally he looked directly at the young man and when he looked at young man the young man smiled and when he did my dad said he knew that was his dad we'll know them they'll know hosts the last time that my grandfather Browning saw me I was 12 years old you'll know me on that day or I think about what Heaven's like and I think about it in the life story brother branham told about how his wife hope was passing and they had pulled a sheet up over her he went to go in the room the nurse that I was going with you to brother and said no I wanted going alone he goes in and he shuts the door and he walks over and he pulls the Sheik back and he said she was gone but he took a hold of her and he said hope well just speak to me one more time and speak to him and he shook her and then he said he screamed hope and when he did her eyes come hope you know what she says why did you call me back and I think about it she had two babies here in this realm and a husband but she said why did you call me back and I want to read this team she says old bill you've preached about it honey you've talked about it but you don't realize what it is I was being taken home by a group of white angels it was like an oriental thing with big birds flying from tree to tree so peaceful the Benham says I believe with all my heart she was going into paradise he says understood by the bedside restraints that have passed and watch them reading loved one that no one else could see what was happening they were dying they were leaving this mortal realm they were beginning to see into that next dimension I remember my being with my mother's dad my grandfather Brown and I remember one time going with him down to the barbershop and we got there there was somebody that came up and I know I don't remember a lot else but I do remember this thing I remember my grandfather asked him saying young man have you ever thought about where are you going to spend eternity yeah that's never left I don't know all of you here today I know a lot of you but I don't know wall where are you going to spend eternity are you gonna go to that place of beauty and rest are you going to go to that place which hope was describing said you've preached about it you've talked about it but still don't understand what it is it's greater than anything that we can describe it's greater than any words that I have used this morning to try to tell you about a heaven that's still great are you gonna go be going over those great atarax brother madam says those fall falling into eternity there in the voice of many waters the voice of the ministers that spoke in the meetings you said here where the word was spoke where you could have given your life to the Lord but you refused the word that was coming for this may be said I still got time I'm young I've got plenty of time there was a man that I know that I remember when we were just kids and uh we just found out the other day he's uh he was just a few years older than me found out the other day that he had something like a boil or something that was on his side and he didn't take care of it and somehow something Stephanie for something said in and he died but he had a half brother who went down to seem to try to get there before he died and when he got there he was on life support and he went in and he tried to see if he could speak to him and he told him he said if if you've ever prayed you need to pray now you need to talk to the Lord and get right he said he didn't see any sign and he had to make the decision moving off life he's gone he's passed there's no prey in the mouth there's no buying them out if he was counting on getting right with God before he passed he didn't get that opportunity it happened too I don't believe Eve knew that he was gonna die you just we had no promise of tomorrow we have no promise of how long but I will tell you this also when Christ comes from the dead in Christ rise all those that are the born again will be changed but those that are not born again will not be changed I want to be amongst the Zbornak our heads is there anyone here this morning say brother I I'm just so unsure but I want to spend eternity in heaven I don't want to go to that place brother branham described was so you want to raise your
