here Lord I invite you Lord to this Pulpit Lord to be the speaker here this morning Lord You're Here Lord and we just want to just give you the preeminence Lord and all of our thoughts and everything Lord we desire you to receive Lord full preeminence Lord this morning may you receive all honor and glory to yourself Lord Comfort every heart Lord in every life Lord we ask these things Lord in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen amen and amen amen let's turn in our Bibles to Romans chapter 8. amen Romans chapter 8 I'm just going to read a few verses of scripture here verse 31. down through verse 34. Romans 8 31 it says what shall we say to these things if God before us who can be against us he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justifies who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died yea rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession for us amen may God bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I'm just going to speak your thought the Lord just is so oppressed on my heart and while I was speaking here on Thursday the inspiration just came right in the midst of that service and then he just and then it just continued to just pick that up on things on Friday morning and I want to just speak on this thought I'm still here he's not finished I'm still here he's not finished the way he came on Thursday night within it was that it was him speaking I'm not finished yet some of you no doubt whether you streamed or you were here you caught that part and how that that transition was in there and you know you just just obey him so I'm still here he's not finished and that was something that I thought Aunt Linda that when you text me I had already been studying this was or had already been here at the church for a number of I don't know hour hours or already more and I thought when she texts me about being here on Sunday and here the Lord's already laid this here on my heart but it's for all of us I mean who can arrange this but God so when you draw this from some of the places on Thursday evening where brother Branham is speaking of this on all things because we we has freely given us all things and one of the things that he has given us is he has even given us death even death as brother Bram says even death we possess death he said think of it possess death he says yes sir it Minds us now remember the minds us of God before us who can be against us he hath free he had delivered his son freely delivered him for us so the whole the whole purpose he's delivering himself that the word itself might come to pass in our life that's the whole work of redemption so now he says yes sir it Minds us so it's minding the purpose of God he said well Glory I done forgot about the explosion of the gun remember brother Branham had had a gun that they had bored out the the barrel for him and brother Branham went out to shoot that gun in the range and the gun itself exploded when he went to shoot it and he talks about how the boat on that gun actually flew clear down to the deer concert Innovation club that was quite a ways away and the barrel shot out 100 yards and he says I'm just he's thinking about that explosion that just had happened he says Why didn't it kill me because he couldn't that's why God wasn't ready he could come as much as he want to but he can't take you Glory he said I paid my debt to that a long time ago and when I believed on Jesus Christ who's Alive forevermore now death listens to what we say he said you say brother Branham a possessor of death he said absolutely Paul said that he we possess it when they were fixing to cut off his head he could say oh death where is your sting where is your sting show me where you can scare me death said I'll squeeze you down I'll put you in the grave you'll rotten canker he said but oh thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ yes sir death Hell In The Grave I possess it all because he conquered it all for us I'm a possessor all right that's good freely giving us all things to where that death death even Minds us because there is a purpose in our lives to be fulfilled now when we look at this brother Brandon when you know make also the statement if you'll just bear with me a moment to just kind of lay this and he's talking about this once again and he says how he says Satan tried to kill me but he can't do it until God is ready for me to come home then I'm ready to go at that time now watch what he says there's some more sick to be prayed for or something to be done now notice here he is he's locked in I'm still here he's not finished yet Hallelujah he goes on in another place and he makes a statement God wasn't through with me yet he says it in another place he says after this explosion the doctor says to him I don't see how your head or shoulders can be on after that explosion so brother bam said I feel by that that the Lord wasn't finished with me yet and maybe he wants me to try to speak a little bit more for his people to try and help and he said I'm here to do all I can do to make life a little easier for you and to try to help the best that I know how so you'll pray for me I'm sure so here he is placed in this he is looking at God spared my life and he's here it is captured knowing Satan would have taken his life but he recognizes within that I'm still here God's not finished so it wasn't I'm just I'm still here and then goes to look at Earthly things that I can still do Earthly things I can still fulfill my bucket list that's not what it's about he said I'm still here he's not finished with me yet because our life is not about us our life's not about us that's what that's what Satan brought to Eve in the beginning is to bring and introduce an anoint with selfishness to where we live for self but because God himself came down and paid the price of redemption blood was shed that now when you and I can be dealt with our life surrendered and the Holy Spirit coming in to bring forth a new man a new woman a son and daughter of God on the inside that then is delivered of selfishness we have to battle it daily but we are delivered of it from within our life from within that new birth because our desire is to do only those things that please him so when we recognize I'm still here he's not finished yet so it's about him why I'm here it's about him so let me just say it in this way Satan would love to send us to a premature grave let me just work with this thought just for a few moments you remember when the disciples Jesus sent them away and they were gone away in a ship to the other side this was after the feeding of the five thousand and they get on the the sea and then there Rises a storm on the sea and brother Bram goes in to describe this Forest that how that Satan begin to blow his poison breath upon the Water because he was going with an intention I'm going to sink them I'm going to drown them and so the waters were responding to that poison breath that's being blown upon them of Satan but remember here in the midst of that time the Bible tells us that Jesus came to them walking upon the Water he came to them and they began to cry wow what is this is it a spirit but he made known to them it is I be not afraid Satan wanted to sink them he wanted to drown them he wanted to take them to a premature grave we without me having to really Define premature we realize that it's something ahead and Before Time so his desire was to do that and but remember when we think of the Lord Jesus brother Brown would point it out he said how did he climb the ramparts of Glory he is seated there at the right hand of God seated in power and authority he's watching over his church uh you know even when they took Peter that time and they were looking like it looked like Peter's life He's Surely a goner but God wasn't finished with Peter yet and it was the church notice how God is working the church is praying for life we are always in the will of God when we are praying for life okay are you hearing me we're always in God's will when we're praying for life it doesn't matter what the situation looks like we are always in God's will when we are praying for life I go through many examples there but brother Brown's Ministry but in any and any rage hear that hear the disciples were praying they had gathered there and they were praying and remember the angel of the Lord went and went right to where Peter was at and loosened him from the inner prison and led him out of the city and then directed him back to the house there and when Peter went and he knocked there at the house remember as he's there you know they've been praying for it but it's so overwhelming to them they opened the doors Peter oh there must be what is this you see what it shows you and I that even in the humanity sometimes we're praying but it shows there's something deeper than our Humanity that's praying it's a son and daughter of God that's on the inside as a matter of fact when we pray in the name of Jesus Christ it is Jesus himself praying through US ask the father anything in my name and I'll do it they were astonished oh my goodness the prayer has been answered in this way [Music] Hallelujah they thought for sure Peter's already entered into the theophany and come back to visit us but it wasn't that way God was not finished with Peter yet Hallelujah so when we see this Brethren would talk about them on the on the on the sea and he said how the devil he saw God saw that the devil was about ready to get him and he said the devil is about ready to get you off brother I'm talking he says it's just about ready you're going to a premature grave some of you going as a sinner if you don't repent some of you will go premature because Satan sickness has set in and gripped the life out of you now notice what he's saying he's saying that there that there is a premature grave and he said some of you are going to go that direction as a sinner if you don't repent I think as a church we should know but sometimes we have to in mind of what is repentance repentance is just not sitting in a church repentance is not just acknowledging what's truth repentance is where you are crying out to God forgive me Lord I am a sinner and I need saving that's repentance it doesn't matter how good you are because no matter how good we are our goodness is nothing but filthy rags in his sight the Bible tells God had commanded man everywhere to repent that's one of the greatest things that God ever brings along our pathway is repentance that's what Jesus Christ being set forth when he's preached in the reality of his person it's something that grips your heart it's not listen we all can be here and we all have experience no doubt you can come across and people sometimes they are repentive but the repentive is not godly repentance they are worldly repentive in other words they're just sorry for the situation they're in oh my wife left me or this happened to me oh this is so terrible and it is terrible but that's not repentance repentance is you recognize I need God I need God Hallelujah sometimes God will allow situations to bring us into a place drive us to where the purpose now can be fulfilled notice in future home brother Brian once again I want you to watch High words this year he said Lord we pray that you would forgive our sins and maybe turn our attention toward the Eternal things and the life that lays Beyond this Mortal reach we pray that you'd give us your directions of how we must turn and what we must do in the future even in the presence now he said Lord there's many sick and needy in the land listen to this and they haven't completed their Journey and our great enemy not only our enemy but your enemy has come to beset them and to stop their life and descend them to a premature grave and we're asking for them today that you and your mercy and Grace Lord will extend their days to the allotted time and you would think wait a minute here God we're praying and asking God to extend our days until the allotted time that's why when even when you see sister Linda standing right here when she tells you they would get given up on her are you hearing me even when she said uh you know I was ready tell them call Hospice as a matter of fact she said that but prayer went up prayer went up did you hear me prayer went up you want to know if God answers your prayer look what was standing in front of you God answers your prayer well you say that was brother and sister so and so you tell that lion devil to get off your shoulder that's right brother Sammy I'm not that strong a Christian let me get some quotes going right now brother random told us that he said God showed you and I that when the weakest Christian would go to their knees in prayer Satan trembles let the devil say you're nothing but a weak Christian but I got a great big God he's done a great work in my life he's working in my life it's not me answering prayer I'm looking to him he's the one that directs the issue you just ought to square your shoulders back and say food devil come on Friends Hallelujah so we'll extend their days remember job said that our days are determined our months are with thee there was God God has that all set forth as far as this this journey in time God has that we can't cross those bounds but remember what job would say turn from him turn from him that that he might accomplish his day as a hireling as a servant and we certainly are thankful for the mercy of God that realizing why we're here I'm still here he's not finished God did not keep me here so that all of a sudden I'd Excel to be the CEO of the company that's not why I'm here that's not why you're here oh God has kept me here that you know that I might purchase a big Ranch that's not why you're here I we are here because he's not finished there's a script apart in this drama that only you are the one that can fulfill it because it's him fulfilling it through you and you can't go off stage until this part has been fulfilled so our being here now I want to just draw this in very clearly our being here is all centered around the purpose of God in fact brother Brandon would say it so clearly indeed if Jesus Christ if we fail if in this lifetime everything else that we do and we fail to repent and be born of the spirit of God he said we have failed the purpose that God brought us on Earth for that's the purpose to be to be born of his spirit so when the purpose of God is fulfilled then we go home that's why sometimes we can't understand I could go through a litany no matter you know from ages and things like that that you and I could look at and think that doesn't make sense I mean from servants and ministers and young people you could think of things it doesn't make sense right Sister Mariah if I'm not mistaken it comes to my mind now there was just uh wasn't in the 28 at the end of 2019 a young sister in Arkansas was lost in a car accident well how old is she 16. I slipped my mind there's those things because I remember standing there youth retreat praying for the groups of sisters that had come from that and different ones and how that they you were dealing trying to deal with those things along with other things that were taking place at that time our mind our mind cannot comprehend sometimes because when we're looking at the purpose even in all of our efforts we look at the purpose sometimes in our own humanity and look let's just be honest and be real okay we love the fellowship of one another even though the purpose of God is finished and that one has went on that steel does not replace us calling him on the phone texting them and saying hey meet me for a coffee that does not take that away but it's something we're able to draw strength from we're able to draw strength from to know that the purpose of God has been fulfilled I can't understand it there's no way I would even try to to try to explain those things even when like I said it comes to ministers and everything else and so forth that it's went on to me in my own mind certain things would not make sense but it's in God's Great economy so while we are here why are we here we are here to serve God's purpose now brother Brown would bring this out in the message things that are to be and speak of how that our life has been pre-planned by God and brother Bram will pick that up and he'll deal with how that in our lives that we were within our father and our great great grandfather remember the scripture tells us that when Abraham met Melchizedek the Bible picks it up in Hebrews 7 and tells us that while Levi was yet in the loins of Abraham and Levi that was his great great grandfather but it was attributed that he paid tithes unto Melchizedek so it was recognized that when it would come to pass he would also recognize God in his generation as well it shows that as brother Brown would tie that in our life was pre-planned but in order for that to come forth in order for our lives to come forth brother Raph says you were in your father you didn't know it neither did you know him at that time but then you were put in the betting ground in the womb of mother through holy wedlock and then you become a person expressed in the image like your father then there's fellowship and it goes on speaking of how God's eternal life moving in to your life and he said there's a Son of God you had to be in him always that Gene of your life spiritual life tonight was in God the Father before there was even a molecule and you're nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in God as a Son of God now you're expressed after his word has come in you notice this you're expressed after not before after his word is come into you to light up this age you are the expression God's life in you because you are a son and daughter of God he said you get what I mean you are now in the lock into this right here you are now made you're setting in in this church tonight because your duty is to express God to this nation this people and this neighborhood where you associate your duty my duty is to do what Express God to express God now faith brother Brown would pick this up again in modern events being clear by prophecy and he's dealing with how that Moses was born with a purpose and he's bringing it on down into our lives and he's talking about that that Fellowship between we were always in our father he said but our father could not have any fellowship with us from a matur Earthly father he said you were there but you didn't know it you knew it not but you was manifested that he might fellowship with you so there's no way then for him to have the fellowship with you until you are manifesting but we were in God's thinking in his thinking we aren't we will always were the Eternal thoughts of God because his thoughts of himself yeah when God thought of you and me what God was thinking of is himself becoming tangible it wasn't God existing with his family it's God becoming his family hallelujah it's Jehovah Jireh moving and drawing and operating and moving into the lives that he has already ordained it's just like when you're getting ready to let's say buy a piece of furniture or you're gonna you know maybe there's a certain picture you're looking at or whatever more and yeah you know what you try to do is you try to make room I guess you do you try to make room for it why because you've already got it in mind you know today's the day we're bringing that picture home you know husband may not know why is this wall Bear right here ah there's something up the sleeve there's a picture coming to that wall now you look in our lives there was a place that was already reserved to recognize and receive God in this hour that place was God himself it laid there is a seed as a dormant but it was a womb a prepared ground that God had made ready that he would receive him in this hour in order to be displayed because God coming into our life is not something that gets put on the back shelf but when God comes into the Life by a real born-again experience Our Lives become the display case of Jesus Christ in this hour are you with me Hallelujah and there is a fellowship with him now brother I'm saying it like this if you're a son and daughter of God you were in God all the time he knew what bed and time you'd be planted so now you're made a creature a Son of God manifested son or daughter of God you ready for this hello you're manifested son and daughter of God to meet the challenge of this hour to vindicate the true and living God of this hour the message that's coming forth in this time that's what you have been ordained for now you and I on our own can't meet the challenge but when him he has come in and we are made a new creature there has stepped in by the new birth it is God operating through his word Heaven and Earth will pass away but my words shall never pass away it is God vindicating his word in this hour it's one thing for somebody to say this message has been revealed to me but it's another thing when you can have a Vindication in your life this is why when the prophet would start with the seals he said not only is he here revealing these seals but he's here vindicating it and he continues that same pattern all the way through and lets you and I know if there is a true Revelation then it must be followed by a true vindication very much who's vindicating it it's God vindicating his word Hallelujah Brian give me a little bit of more juice up here so the whole purpose of being here is to express God but Sammy you mean my whole purpose ain't to build up my 401k no I mean the Bible tells us The Prudent man looks before the future but your life is not wrapped in your 401k if it is you might want to make sure you've got some beneficiaries listed there because you may not get a chance to enjoy it that's not to scare you but do not plan on things that are so fragile do not plan and we shouldn't make plans but do not invade you say well how can I not make plans and yet not invest well when we're investing we have to understand what is it that should be the number one investment in our lives what's the number one investment seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness that's not a One-Shot deal that keeps on moving in our lives brother random when he said I'm still here he ain't finished not that I'm not finished not that oh you know what I'm still here you know what I'm not finished I wanted some more barbecue I wanted some more steak I wanted some more and that's not why God extended his life he's realizing it why how does he realize this because he has been born of the spirit of God and what motivates his life you say that's because he was a prophet then you're telling me he has a different life in him than what you and I have access to I don't believe that I believe the same way that word the way that life operates there it'll operate in the rest of the body and not only do I believe it I am a witness of that I'm an experiencer of that that it operates in our lives that even when I don't feel like it there is something that's bubbling up within my soul that helps me and says you need to pray boy you need to read boy you need to listen to the Earth you need to call this you need to do this even when my flesh says against it not against the word but there's something that rises up aren't you glad there's something that can Rise Up In You then when there's things that could be we could say relatively harmless but the spirit of God can rise up in you and say be careful don't get entangled don't get entangled because why you ever see anybody fishing with a tangled up line what's the first thing you do foreign let's restring this thing and knot it up and get the things on there right it can't it's hard to fish with a tangled up line that's the same thing it's hard it's hard to be a fisherman with a tangled up line it's hard to serve god with a tangled up life come on now now listen don't go pointing fingers at somebody else oh if it weren't from my husband if it weren't for my don't blame nobody else on you being Tangled Up do you realize you can live just as Victorious as you desire to live in Christ stop letting the devil tell you that the atmosphere is out here if you've entered into the holiest of holies what difference does it make if the sun is shining what difference does it make if the candles get blown out in the Holy place you've been lit with the Shekinah Glory of Almighty gods don't you let the devil tell you your Victory is dependent on this you have access to Victory in Jesus Christ Hallelujah notice how Paul could write this in first Timothy chapter 4 and he would write of how in his time this is preparing for departure and Paul would say at my first answer no man stood with me all men forsook me I pray God that it will not be laid to their charge notwithstanding the Lord stood with me and strengthened Me That by me the preaching might be fully known and that all the Gentiles might hear and I was delivered out of the mouth of the Lion how many knows God still delivers from the mouth of lions blind Devils lined God still delivers from the mouth of the light what was the Lions to do to try to consume him try to take his life prematurely but notice where his testimony is God delivered me from the mouth of lions Verse 18 I love this and the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work and will preserve me unto his Heavenly Kingdom now when Paul writes this remember he's just wrote about this above how that he was stoned and left for dead he was also telling them hey you might want to watch out put a bulletin on the on on the church bulletin board and put the guy's name under there Alexander the copper Smith because he did me much harm wisdom would say you know what wherever he's at right there just kind of go around it not Shun from it but see God is alerting the church in that hour but Paul after he's wrote this when Paul was stoned for death who delivered him God delivered him just what Paul was talking about Deliverance Deliverance wasn't that God was just picking him up like a puppet and he wasn't going to have no trials he didn't have no heartaches remember Paul wrote in the scriptures what I read to you on Thursday he wrote to those in Corinth I was in death plural often off it wasn't just a one-time deal if Paul if we were given testimonies in church whoever who's had a near-death experience you would be able to say you know what sorry the rest of y'all Paul took up the whole testimony service because it had been Time and Time and Time and Time Again well no doubt sitting right here today there's been people been delivered from near-death experience there's no doubt even things that we and I don't even know of and you might say why me I'll tell you why you're still here because he's not finished with you I'll tell you what I can answer that question you're here because he's not finished with you maybe you're not ready to go and God has paired your life because you're not ready to meet him you're still here he's not finished with you yet [Applause] Oh Glory and the Lord will preserve me unto his Heavenly Kingdom this is why when brother random would pick it up about the wise men and he would talk about how the wise men brought those three gifts they traveled through all those lands where the ishmaelite bandits were and when you think of it how they traveled through all that it is really quite mind-blowing when you consider how that they went through all of that with these gifts and the treasures that they had but yet and not being robbed what was that it was the hand of God upon the gifts that they had are you hearing me now in Washington the men so much as it was the gifts they held they were inspired by God to bring those gifts oh help me now they had had a prophet down there and Daniel if you were to ask Daniel Daniel could sit there and Babylon and say I don't even know I'm here I don't know why God has brought me here I don't know why God has given me favor here while the rest of the Hebrew is there why has God giving me favor here brother Brian goes in to tell us because Daniel was there with a message knowing there would be those there in that time and Daniel was announcing to them there is a coming Messiah and a star shall arise out of Jacob and that word alone that would be there through that time would be something that would set within the hearts from this generation into that generation until there was a group of wise men that would be inspired by the inspiration of God that was being poured out upon that generation and they were moved to come with these gifts um but the Bram says do you understand it why God he said has watched over this gift in this lady of cnh he said he says to your church church do you understand it why God has watched over this gift now this is at the end of 63. this is a almost a year later after explosion seals have been opened and he's announcing to the church trying to get him to see hey when we look back here at the wise men and see how God watched over them all the ishmaelite bandits and everything else but they had a gift something that God had put in their hearts that would declare who he was frankincense in service the gold deity that have murdered the bitterness of death all of those gifts would declare him on Earth let me tell you something you are ordained by God in this hour you are ordained to declare almighty God while the rest of the world could say he still is not the same uh you know these things in sin and sickness all it's too deep it's too bad but there is a God that your life gives a testimony and a witness and Satan would love to Snuff it out Satan would love to take it but he can until that purpose has been served years purpose and serving to God you may not realize it it might be to your neighbor it might be to that factory worker someone along the way but God is so fit in it that your life is purposed here to declare him that's why brother Brandon could say that's why God has protected it the way he has and he will protect it until his purpose is served now remember in the scripture where it speaks to you and I in second Corinthians chapter 5 that if this Earthly Tabernacle this body that we're in that's so frail if it be dissolved we have a tabernacle already waiting it'd be like for those of you who were selling your house and you purchased another house what you're doing is is simply changing addresses you're moving from one house into another house so moving from your Earthly house into that house that's already been prepared for you now I don't want to deal with that this morning but in the meantime notice how Paul would write of that that what we are going to in other words we have everything in the world to look forward to are you with me now listen let me just let me just put this on that does not mean that we walk around here in life and say oh Lord I I just want to go home I want to just Lord I want to go home and be with you and your wife said honey come sit down on the couch with me no I just want to go home and be with the Lord that's part of the work come on now the body calling you know call hey come on let's let's sit down for some fellowship but no I just want to go home to be with the Lord we want to go home and be with the Lord but God has never anointed you to go to a premature grave God has never anointed you to wish your life away I know look look when job was going through things job got to a spot in his test and his trial shows the weakness that can come in our Humanity when Joe can say oh I wish the day had never come that they said a man child is born job even with a trial that took place his breath to his wife became strange you know what I'm speaking of it became strange there was nothing there between the trial was so overwhelming but God in his grace God and His grace are you hearing me now job didn't know what was going on but the prophet tells us he stood flat-footed that didn't mean he ran everywhere else he stood flat-footed but God has brought me this far I don't know what he's doing right now but I am going to wait on him I'm gonna wait on him Hallelujah so in the minion in the meantime in the meantime when all of this is taking place we recognize this you see this is why the Liberty God has not anointed us to go in that way are you hearing me Church listen all out here in this world it isn't just here all around us depression and anxiety and everything oppression all those things are around it's not just you know where Satan coming you know a children of God hello but what I'm trying to tell you by his spirit is that you're here he's not finished yet you've got a right to back that devil up and say wait a minute here I'm not wishing my way along my life away God's got a reason that I'm here there's a purpose that I'm to serve are you with me all these things is real depression's real anxiety is real but let's not make it a poster God on our walls are you hearing me church we don't want to worship those things oh brother Sammy if you only understood it I may not understand it to the level of self but neither do I minimize it but I am going to exalt the Lord Jesus because I know that he's the one that helps you he helps me daily and these the one we need to have confession for I don't feel like that's the very time you need to confess so Paul is saying let me just read what Paul goes into in second Corinthians 5 6 we are always confident knowing that while we are at home in the body and absent from the Lord we walk by faith and not by sight we are confident I say willing rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord wherefore we labor that whether we that whether present or absent we may be accepted of him for we must all appear before the Judgment seat of Christ this is not the white Throne judgment the Judgment seat of Christ is where we all appear before and give account that everyone may receive the things done in this body according to what he hath done whether it be good or bad I want to hear him say well done right I don't want to be like the teacher handing back and say hey why'd you skip these problems well those problems are too hard I want to get done I want to go to recess I want to go lunch that's the most important thing for school lunch right pizza day walking taco I know my lunch stuff from school and the teacher looks and says what are you doing we don't want God to stand there on that day and say hey not in fear of us being turned away at the Judgment seat of Christ but God's saying why did you why did you why did you not press a little bit more why did you let little things get in your way hello that's part of the Judgment seat of Christ I'm not preaching on that today but there's a part of it because sometimes we just think man everything is gone no we'll give an account oh God help us I want him to say Well done but I don't want to hand him a multiple choice for C is the only one circled likelihood sees the right answer I I there's going to be things on there problems I'll have before me brother Ray that I will not know the answer to some of them I'll have to pray and wait and wait and wait I'll come to church expecting the answer I'll pray I'll put on a message I'll be sitting there and I'm waiting for the answer and sometimes the answer comes in a way that I'm not even expecting but thanks be to God he alerts me to it oh letter A thank you Lord and we normally thank God for the answer but we're thankful Lord thank you for helping me to just be patient Lord thank you for helping me to not look around and man everybody else going out to recess I'm the only guy in here right now this is why when brother Bram said we he said we want that report to go back to Papa and that report to go up that your son his whole thoughts is upon you he's trying to do everything he tries to do is try to please you he's so interested in your affair till it's hard to hold him down help us Lord I'd rather be just a little overzealous about the father's Kingdom than to have no Zeal at all for it I'd rather overwork brother Brandon says there's a Church of Christ preacher said one time I'd rather wear out than rust out that is a lot of Truth he said I'd rather die in the harness he said you can't do anything any worse then neglect to try it's like you telling somebody hey you know maybe they could use your skills at this job oh no they couldn't they could they couldn't at all they they don't they don't pay enough they couldn't do this how do you know well you know they call so and so they go how do you know well because you know how do you know you don't know hello somebody Hallelujah you can't do nothing any worse than neglect try in other words I'd rather die trying are you hearing me I'd rather die trying let us do all we can with what you have to do with so God doesn't want you and I looking at somebody else oh if I could only preach like that brother or if I could only sing like that sister or if I can only testify like that brother if I be who God Made You because God's made you that certain way for a certain reason Hallelujah this is why look what Look What the Lord Jesus would say remember when they went to Gold let me just kind of move through these quickly when the Lord Jesus they went and here he is getting ready he's gone he's had a had a meeting there with a woman at the well and you know the things that took place there uh they went to go get some food some meat and when they came back the Lord Jesus here he is they were asking him eat master and the Lord Jesus said I have meat to eat that you don't know of they started looking around what's he talking who came in did he get me did he have some did he have something put in the backpack was there something who who came and fed him he was he was letting them know there's something higher than natural meat there's something there's a higher purpose than natural purposes are you with me he said my meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work in John 5 36 he said I have a greater witness than that of John for The Works which a father hath given me to finish the same works that I do bear witness of me that the father hath sent me so had given me to finish now notice how is he finishing these works now remember Jesus is not walking around just doing as he pleases are you hearing me he's not just walking around you know I think I'll heal this one you know what I think I'll go down there to Lazarus house you know what I think I'll go over here to the pool of Bethesda Jesus was not walking like that this was a restoring of what was lost in Eden where man had gone out from under the full preeminence of God in his life and here he is as a son of God the Son of God Jesus answered John 5 19. you're familiar with it verily verily I say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father doing so what was coming to pass was what he was seeing the father doing then do what the son likewise so here look think of this you think Satan wasn't trying to distract him hello you think Satan wasn't trying because you and I look at things and we think man I feel like I've battled distractions I feel like the enemy comes at me he faced that same thing so don't let the devil run you down he faced that same thing he faced Temptation such as you and I face sometimes we look at Temptations and we're thinking about all the wrong immoral things even the temptation to be less diligent dilatory just uh you know you know it's the program of God I'll make it I just you know we become that we battle through those Temptations Jesus had to battle those same things distractions to try to do what let's just be simple so everybody understand it he gives me an example I'm going to give it you ever been in a game with somebody or been some event and you got somebody sitting next to you and wants to talk your head off and you're there to watch the game and they're talking about this and talking about hey you see this and hey you see that buddy if you didn't want to see the game go find somebody else that don't want to see the game because I'm missing things all of a sudden the crowd stands up and whoa yeah yeah give me five man good good job man you're like what are we doing this for you're like just sitting there you know why you got distracted you got distracted and all it takes is just a small moment to get distracted and Satan studies you and I I said he studies you and me he knows our weak points oh we still got them he knows our weak points and he works upon that to try to distract us oh preach with me now hmm but what he seeth the father doing God helped me to stay locked in we find ourselves drifting a little bit Lord forgive me help me to be locked in when we get up of the morning Lord help me to being locked in brother Samuel what are you doing I don't trust this guy this guy is not for me but this guy on the inside is going to lead this guy to a body change I've got to listen to the Inner Man and sometimes the inner man says shut up shut up you ain't you pretend like you're my friend and you're my buddy you're only that when all the blessings are coming down but how are you when the blessings aren't coming down remember I'm not with you for the ride you're with me for the ride brother Samuel they'll able to lock you up hey I don't care it's a reality distraction to try to get us distracted from seeing what's going on now he'll come in very steadily he'll come in very slowly with things that can seem so harmless things that you and I we would not question is sin not so whatsoever but if he can just somehow get our attention just for a little bit maybe it's things where family man and family families right in line in order with God but maybe it sings within those things that can be where they're not sinful but he just says all I got to have is just a moment to keep them distracted but I'm grateful to God let's just brag on him I'm grateful to God that there's a greater attraction and I'm grateful that there is the grace of God that when we have become a little bit distracted I'm grateful for God's grace that will preach Andre sit down and say hey boy get back in step get back in Step listen it's not you keeping you it's God keeping you I'm still here because he's not finished hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh like brother Adam said he said God I said I never believed the church was a haphazard event Jesus never came to Earth in a haphazard way he never died in a haphazard way he came for a purpose and that purpose was to fulfill the Commandment of God that he might purchase to himself a church without spot wrinkle or blemish now that same what we read in earlier scriptures reflects through the bride he said I'm come the reason I'm here I've got a work to do my meat is to do the will of him that sent me to finish his work you see here was an anointing of his life the Redeemer anointing is the Redeemer about a redeemer anointing is anointing now as it moves in this hour is to finish the work the Bible said in Romans 9 28 for he will finish the work somebody said he will say it like you believe it he will he will finish the work and cut it short in righteousness because a short work will the Lord make upon the Earth that's this message of the hour Philippians 1 6 being confident of this very thing that he which he done a good word till the day of Jesus Christ so what are we going to do Hebrews 12 1 wherefore sing we are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily be sent us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith now says let us run the race of what patience endurance so things hardships and different things will come but run the race with patience and sometimes there's trials that comes our way and when sometimes things comes our way it's God letting us know there's some things you got in your life that you think are pretty valuable but God begins to let light be shown upon it and you realize but this is heavy this this thing's weighing me down keeping this bitterness in my life man it's weighing me down it's keeping me out of Fellowship this lack of forgiveness Lord have mercy I got to get this thing out of my life what is it it is God bringing light upon that so that you and I might release that weight hello now because why it's a finisher anointing Upon Our Life That's the anointing of this hour the hands of jerubbabel have laid the foundation his hands shall also finish it we are living in the finishing time this is a finishing message the mystery of God should be finished it is the finisher anointing of the Redeemer in our midst it's what keeps moving you and I the Bible when we read that hear that song I Feel the pull then the other one brother Paul wrote something keeps holding me it's wrote with the expression it's God at work in our life [Applause] Paul could say in Acts chapter 20 verse 24 none of these things move me neither count I my life dear to myself so that I might finish my course Paul said I can't take Timothy's course I can't take time discourse I've got to finish my course my course I've got to finish it and so all these things that are happening Paul we're coming after you Paul we're going to kill you Paul we're going to do this Paul we're going to do that Paul what did he say because there was an absolute he was so yoked with the word of God he said I don't even count my life dear to myself in other words I've esteemed the working of almighty God more than my own life foreign so that I might finish my course what's that what's that say yeah with joy like brother jewelry oh brother Sammy don't you want to know what I'm going through oh family gather around let me tell you about the joy of the Lord joy of the Lord that sounds like the complaints of you don't you put that off of the joy of the Lord understand we all go through things I'm not diminishing anyone listen friends I'm not putting anyone up diminishing yours or putting I'm not doing that at all but I'm trying to say do you realize it may not be a Bible verse or a quote that gets your family it might be the joy of the Lord matter of fact I'm sure that's what it'll be in your life this message is not a book it's not a tape it's Jesus Christ your duty my duty is to express God if you're not full with joy you need to come back and get a refilling and you know what even if it went down about that much I'd say it's a good time for a good refilling [Applause] it's time for a good refilling oh yeah absolutely friends listen the joy of the Lord doesn't mean bubble dancing I believe in being I and listen friends I believe in being enthused about the things of God but the joy of the Lord that even in the midst of trial there is a joy that passes your understanding it's a joy what is it it's the strength not your strength not your DNA it's the strength of almighty God that in the face of adversity that you know who you are you know in whom you believe it stabilizes you in the middle of that situation I'm still here he's not finished with me yet Hallelujah I want to be able to stand like Paul on second Timothy 4. 6 I'm now ready to be offered that word offered means It's My Life to be poured out as a drink offering I'm ready for my lifetime you know why because that's what Paul's life was that's not just Paul that's the call of every believer it's pouring out our lives for him oh if brother Brandon was here I'd just do something good for him he said if you want to do something good for me do something for one of my children I'm not his I'm not his physical child but I am a product of this message amen the Holy Spirit has come and brought forth and brought forth what a son and daughter of God and we want to we want to do something good sometimes we're looking oh I want to do this what for do unto the least of these my brother then you have done it unto me I wonder if when we stand before the Judgment seat of Christ and we stand there and the Lord says I tried to anoint you to call that brother come on friends I'm not trying to be getting scared I'm just preaching this right now I wonder if we can say oh but Lord but but you said you were too busy I'm still here he's not finished with me yet he's not finished as far as being finished my life as far as capped off yeah but that doesn't mean that everything's oh I've been sealed that no no it's now now what's happened when the Holy Ghost has come it is power for service not power for sin power for service I have fought a good fight I have finished my course I have kept the faith let me read you one more scripture I don't know this scripture this scripture has stood out to me for years I don't know maybe I'm just simple that way but a scripture out of First Corinthians 15 where we look behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep and you read through all that glorious transformation of the body of Believers oh my the moving from the terrestrial to the celestial and we read of all that the very last verse let's read it verse 58. therefore my beloved brethren be ye steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord I look at that scripture I've looked at that for over and over in that chapter Paul is riding with an inspiration that what we're looking for we've got a great expectation but until that moment let's be unmovable let's be steadfast are you with me let's be steadfast unmovable not compromising and abounding growing abounding in the work of the Lord he's not I'm still here he's not finished what is it there's work to be done oh brother Sammy you're right I've got to really work on my 401k I've got no no no you're missing the point you're missing the point if you focus on the right things first everything else God will direct you on that are you hearing me but if you get that ahead of God oh friends that's a dangerous scenario it's got to be God's kingdom first it's got to be that spiritual meat first and notice abounding in the work of the Lord for you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord how many remember this that little lady and I'm closing here on this let me remember that little lady she got on her heart to do something for the Lord and what she wanted to do what came on her heart she was a wash woman and she got on her heart to go rent this stable This Barn and clean it she got in there and she cleaned it out of all the manure all the straw she got in there because a burden was on her heart to have a meeting now she wasn't the one who's going to conduct the meeting but she got on her heart to rent that place and clean it and they had a brush Harbor meeting right there that in that night and you know who came out of that meeting here came in here came in a boy with long hair bibbed overhauls and fell across the altar by the name of the white Moody you know her name no we don't don't know her name but here here She was she got a burden and think of it she's serving the lord all these I don't know how long of a time all those years but at that moment here everything just moved in and hear what came out of that a Dwight Moody who won countless Souls to the Lord as an instrument used by God no doubt there was times that she might have Brethren picks it up in Victory Day or that day on Calvary she might have looked down in her life I'm just a wash woman what can I do look at me am I I can't even speak writer I can't do this right I look we all have our flaws all right we all let me just put it this way we all have our excuses of why God can't use us right it'd be like me holding up my iPad and show you how many pages that I'm staring at you go oh my goodness don't worry I Don't Preach out of that many pages but you'd look at oh my goodness that's sometimes when we get before God and we offer him all the excuses of why we can't do it but remember it ain't your abilities it's doing it are you hearing me I'm still here not because of my abilities you're not here because of your abilities I'm still here because he's not finished God bless you brother Liz I'm still here because he's not finished then I would say like this even here here's another day here's another moment Lord what would you have me do today help me Lord today I would just start the day out I would start out like that Lord help me today Lord if there's things the Lord that I need to unpack out of my life weights things that's weighing me down things that that I've allowed to come in that's weighing down my family weighing this down Lord help me I don't want these weights that start slowing me down I want to run this race with patients because we are the final runners you can look behind you there ain't nobody else behind you the batons in your hand but there's a cloud of many witnesses and that cloud of many witnesses could testify and say he did it through me he used me despite all of my weaknesses despite all of my flaws and my failures he received the glory through my life I stand as a witness and what is it it's the word in this hour where the seals have been taken off and there is voices yeah of many thunderings that are saying you can make it keep pressing keep pressing I'm still here he's not finished [Applause] Hallelujah maybe for him maybe this morning he want what he wants to do is he wants to finish your life he wants to cap your life with the Holy Ghost maybe this morning is to bring your life into a place of repentance and then again it's to encourage our lives that to continue and say hey don't allow those distractions in your life things that he brings up I don't have to call him out but he by coming right up next to you there's things that you can realize this is holding me back this is holding me back and it ain't somebody else it's me allowing it to hold me back because really holding you back is about putting a restraint on God and you can look at and say don't need this I don't want no restraints on Jesus let's pray Heavenly Father Lord Jesus I'm still here you're not finished Lord throughout Lord this building here this morning God even those that would be streaming those that Lord would archive it later on I believeth on my heart Lord Jesus you have called and spoke to our hearts every one of us we even see a testimony stand before us Lord how that you so arranged it knowing Lord that even in my heart I started over here to study on something Lord that you had put on my heart just a week and a half ago and so forth that's been continuing with the thought that you moved that Lord that inspiration moving Lord these moments are pre-planned by you I'm still here you're not finished now Lord I pray that God that your mercy will move Lord as you have been through this service God May hearts and lives Lord may we lord earnestly reflect upon our life and see the purpose Lord what we are here for Lord God I pray right now if there is a heart that does not know you Lord Lord maybe they know about you but they've never really repented Lord never really surrendered their life to you to say Lord I am a sinner Lord I need you Lord God lord I want you Lord Jesus to be my savior Lord Lord I want Lord I want that work I want that reality lord I can't explain it all but God that peace that I sense that that reality Lord God that is moved Lord and tugged upon my heart that's what I desire Lord I want you granted Lord may they realize maybe not knowing all the times that Lord where Satan has conspired to take them to a premature grave that may they take this opportunity because after all that's what life is life is an opportunity it's an opportunity Lord to serve you to serve your purpose we don't know how long our Earthly purpose is Lord just as on Friday when speaking to the young people speaking about Garnet Peak Lord where the Prophet would take and speak of Garnet's life Garnet was an 18 year old boy when he passed away and to thank Lord God of in his life polio had come into his life your Prophet was able to tell us it was polio that drove him to you to where that Lord God he could come to that place of what's a real purpose in life Lord God his Earthly Journey was finished purpose at 18 years old but the purpose of God had been served and Garnet was awaiting and went on to heaven Lord Jesus may we take Lord God that opportunity this morning I pray father for our lives Lord there's lives no doubt sitting here this morning Lord that the desire that you would have we're still here because you're not finished there's a further work Lord a further step in our life a further yielding to you Lord God more than Lord just of repentance but a life that Lord God as it you begin to move and to clean that life Lord God as they begin to yield Lord to your presence and God you begin to clean that life and to the place Lord to where that you cap it with your presence with your spirit to where their life Lord becomes a full expression of you Lord we'll never be perfect in ourselves but it becomes a Perfection of your own life working through us not what I not not Lord God Desiring of things of the flesh but as Paul would write where we walk after the spirit the desire is to please you Lord God Lord I pray that you'll help every one of us in here Lord knowing Lord God that it's Satan's objective and desire he would love Lord to distract us from the purpose that we are here for but God we're under the we're under the finishing message we're under Lord God the finishing anointing God let it move in our hearts Lord God may it move in our lives Lord Jesus maybe things have come around that we've allowed Lord God to get in the way Lord forgive us Lord I pray help us Lord God as faithful Runners help us Lord that God what you have spoke to our hearts we know what the weights are sin that does so easily be said is Lord God let us Lord take under the authority of your voice and lay it aside right here this morning Lord let our hearts be United Lord with you Lord with your desire with your will God I pray that Lord help us to run not as distracted people but it's people that are running with a real Divine attraction in our lives Lord may you give strength Lord and courage May Lord God his Hearts would look to you may you restore their Joy Lord as Paul could say I'm here to finish my course with joy may the Lord God realize they're still here I think Lord is what my Aunt Linda said right here her request the Lord God when she was asking you for her healing she said I want to live for my family I want to live for them Lord God it's her heart's desire is to see them Lord God walking Lord in the light of this hour oh granted Lord God we're still here Lord we're not here Lord to make more money we're not here Lord to do things Lord God that would extend the Earthly Kingdom no no no no no no I'm still here you're not finished so Lord our hearts cry out Lord what would you have me do help me Lord to be more surrendered help me Lord help me not to be distracted Lord help me not to become so busy with my life that I look not upon the things of others because that's not what you did having cares having needs yet Lord God you looked upon the needs of others what God is you were bringing to my attention even last week and I think as I was Lord walking here in the middle of this aisle Lord God and praying and it struck my heart that the things that we do it's not about us it shouldn't be it shouldn't be whether I fell a ship or not well I don't need Fellowship but maybe my brother needs Fellowship maybe my sister needs encouragement It Ain't About Me it's about the body because the body when Paul came there on the road to Damascus you said why do you persecute me he's talking about the body it was Christ in body form Lord that's the same way now help us the Lord this flesh the Lord God is so weak we're not here to brag it up but it's true Lord and forgive us many times Lord God we have succumbed to that Lord God instead of pressing Beyond it this is not an easy walk it's not something Lord that comes easy as a matter of fact the further we go in time the more that we will have to press like never before press to pray press to read press to be in the house of God press to be in Fellowship we will have to press harder and harder and harder help us Lord I pray help us Lord God give us Lord may we lord receive lord of the strength the right influence Lord help us God I pray because we're still here you're not finished Lord maybe I have overlooked a line on the script maybe there's a part on the play I Remember in school sometimes Lord when they would tell me what my part is and we would read around the classroom and I'd try to find all my parts so I did not look foolish if I missed it and I looked through there and try to pick out all my parts in that in that textbook but sometimes Lord it'd get to a spot and I thought they look at you realize at that moment or that what's happening is that part I thought I had all those parts and I missed a part Lord help us help us Lord give us Grace for every part Lord every line maybe it's not even a line maybe it's just an expression Lord I'm convinced with all my heart it's not so much words it's the expression of Jesus Christ that gets the attention of others Lord help us Lord May Our Lives preach Faithfully may it preach Faithfully Jesus Christ help us Lord and they say Lord help me help me Lord help me Jesus [Music] with all the Hearts Let's just determine Lord I'm going to serve your purpose Lord under your will under your will I'm going to serve your purpose Lord I'm still here you're not finished help me Lord help me Lord help me to just be sensitive maybe it's just for that maybe it's just for for that last little moment but Lord help me to just be sensitive for that moment I'm still here Lord what would you have me to do what soul would you happen to go to Lord who is it Lord remember my family who is it Lord I'm still here he's not finished is that how you feel this morning yeah I'm still here he's not finished amen if you'd like to stand you could stand let's just let's just worship him let's just enter in just let's just worship him his word has come forth let's just let the spirit of God just saturate that word as you pulsating in our hearts I'm still here he's not finished Lord water that in Lord maybe there's things that as God is watering in it's so important in this watering moment that it would water and strengthen that maybe it's something that you need to just let go of and he's here to water that just strengthen you just just a refreshing of rain coming down upon that seed of the word I'm going to send largest Rain On Me Lord I want to just let the rain just let it fall on me I want to worship Lord I want to water that word

I wanted to see that service not the service but I wanted to see the service where Ryan had come up for prayer when he got on from that internship and I went back and I started listening to that part of it and I clipped it out and that's the very song We were singing you made a way and when as we were closing that song out you made a way you see him coming right into the picture frame to stand right here brother Brian started singing the song he's got it all in control I had that song in my heart and I was going to tell brother Brian sing this song you can catch it on video I looked at him

brother Samuel and we had prayer and that song God's got it all in control you know you might be standing here today as all of us were maybe there's others he's still the Waymaker you might wonder in your life this morning how could I how could I ever get me on this thing or this or that but he's a savior he made a way and the goodness of God leads you to repentance see God Made A Way and he dealt with Ryan's heart oh I'm so glad about that aren't you because it's one thing for God to deal with our hearts it's another thing to receive it but he received the way that God had made and I think about that how pressing it is if you're standing here this morning you haven't made that decision this is a moment to make that decision you're still here because he's not finished he wants to finish he wants his purpose to be fulfilled in your life and he wants to fulfill it I'll tell you he'll do for your life what you could not even dream possible Satan comes as a thief and Robert to kill and to destroy but he said I'm come that you might have life and have it more abundantly that's beyond imagination what you can even imagine glory be to God I'm glad he's a Waymaker this morning aren't you he's a Waymaker oh Hallelujah I know in this in this lifetime I know I could speak with family I won't be able to pick up my phone on the morning say hey how's this going and I get a text back from him but the same guy I got a test coming up okay buddy I'll be praying for you today and then I know I won't be able to do that but I know one of these days along with others I've seen I've got that confidence I'll see him as far as in this Earthly Journey oh it's sadness it's sadness but you know what God Made A Way and God was announcing I've got this all in control I mean I've got it in control I'm glad God has everything in control Hallelujah let's just pray Lord Jesus I pray that father here this morning Lord if there's one heart that God that you're dealing with Lord that has not surrendered to you you pressed on My Heart Lord now I ask Lord God that you would move for that life those lives just like you moved on Ryan's life Lord there was a surrender to your call granted Lord
