[25:17] work
[25:17] amen and so I wanted to come true here
[25:22] to visit brother san but he told me he
[25:24] was gone so but I said you can come
[25:27] anyway I'd like for you to come in and
[25:30] to take two just to replace him as he
[25:35] heard he's in New Mexico I've talked to
[25:37] him today
[25:38] so here we are so we were heading to
[25:43] brother Paul's in Toledo this weekend
[25:46] for some special meetings and also for
[25:48] the tri-state Youth Service on Sunday
[25:50] night so I knew that the sound was not
[25:53] too far so I said stem want us to come
[25:56] by and see you but I see the sons and
[25:59] the church amen so without further delay
[26:03] well turn in our Bible tonight in the
[26:04] book of Genesis chapter 4 verse 16
[26:09] tonight I want to speak on the ideology
[26:13] of Satan's Eden and as a subtitle I want
[26:16] to call it calling upon the name of the
[26:19] Lord it's quite of a different maybe a
[26:22] unique topic but I've preached a series
[26:25] back home and I preached it at different
[26:27] places and it's been a blessing and I
[26:30] want to share it with you actually it's
[26:32] a couple of service that I'll compress
[26:34] into one and so I will skip a lot I just
[26:37] try to give you the main the main point
[26:40] here just for you to get a thought so
[26:43] Genesis chapter 4 verse 16
[26:49] and Cain went out of the presence of the
[26:54] Lord and he dwelt in the Land of Nod on
[26:56] the East of Eden and Cain knew his wife
[27:00] and she conceived and bare Enoch and he
[27:02] build the city and called the name of
[27:04] the city after the name of his son Enoch
[27:06] and his brother's name was Jubal and he
[27:08] was the father was all such handle the
[27:10] harp and organ and Zilla she also bear
[27:13] tubal-cain an instructor of our every
[27:15] artificer in brass and and aaron and the
[27:18] sister of tubal-cain and Naima
[27:21] let's turn also in the book of first
[27:23] Corinthians chapter 7 book of 1st
[27:32] Corinthians chapter 7 we'll just read
[27:37] one scripture here verse 31
[27:49] if you there say Amen and they that use
[27:52] this world as not abusing it or the
[27:55] fashion of this world passeth away now
[27:59] the word here abusing comes from the
[28:02] Greek word it's Catholic I am a witch I
[28:05] don't know how does to say it but it's
[28:08] just it means
[28:09] abusing is to use much or excessively or
[28:12] to be consumed by use so the Bible says
[28:17] and they that use this world we all use
[28:20] this world we all came drove drive car
[28:23] use cell phone use computer we have we
[28:26] are not from this world but we are in
[28:29] this world just going through and so we
[28:33] have to use it but the Bible says here
[28:35] it's a warning to us that that those
[28:37] that use this world as not abusing it or
[28:40] to excessively use it or to be consumed
[28:44] by use Amen let's borrow a head Lord
[28:47] Jesus we want to thank you tonight that
[28:49] we are gathering your presence in your
[28:51] name and Lord we want to take for you to
[28:53] take control over every spirit tonight
[28:55] and we want you to come forward with
[28:58] your word and we want to surrender
[28:59] ourselves for a thought everything that
[29:01] we are Lord and may you come through the
[29:03] preaching of the word tonight to bless
[29:05] edify and and and and and bring more
[29:08] light on our path we pray in Jesus name
[29:10] Amen amen you may be seated and as you
[29:13] see that you can turn in John 7 chapter
[29:16] 17 verse 13 will be more in line tonight
[29:20] in the more like of a modern event made
[29:23] clear by prophecy type of sermon John
[29:26] chapter 17 verse 13
[29:34] John chapter 17 verse 13 here Jesus is
[29:38] saying basically what I said a few
[29:40] minutes ago and now I come let's give to
[29:48] verse for sake of time let's skip to
[29:51] verse 15 and I pray not that thou
[29:54] shouldest take them out of the world but
[29:56] thou thou shouldest keep them from the
[29:59] evil they are not of the world even as I
[30:02] am NOT of the world sanctify them
[30:04] through thy truth thy Word is truth and
[30:07] Dao has sent me into the world even so
[30:11] have I also send them into the world and
[30:13] for their sake I sanctify myself that
[30:17] they also might be sanctified through
[30:19] the truth amen
[30:22] and so the Jesus saying here that is
[30:26] prayer is not for us to be taken out of
[30:29] this world but to be kept from the evil
[30:33] and so I wanted go into a study tonight
[30:38] in basically on the ideology of Satan's
[30:43] Eden because since we have to live in
[30:45] this world we have to be careful of the
[30:48] mind that's in this world Jesus says we
[30:52] have to be kept from the evil and so we
[30:55] are using this world we are walking in
[30:57] this world you know there's different
[30:59] religion that has tried to separate
[31:01] themselves from the world and not use
[31:03] technology and stay back into the the
[31:06] old tools and and run the farm with you
[31:09] no telephone and no technology no
[31:12] tractors and basically be a secluded but
[31:15] that's not the will of the Lord the Lord
[31:18] says he was not taking us out of the
[31:20] world and even Paul saying that we are
[31:22] we will use the world but let's not be
[31:25] consumed by the world so tonight I want
[31:30] to do a little bit of study on the
[31:32] mothering because actually we are going
[31:34] through some major change right now in
[31:36] our civilization and I want to in light
[31:39] to put some light onto it as a help and
[31:42] I'm going to name
[31:44] lot of tools that we are using a lot of
[31:46] devices want to talked about and uh
[31:49] we're coming to a point where we cannot
[31:51] avoid using them
[31:52] I can imagine long time ago when they
[31:55] were using horses and buggy when the
[31:57] first car came
[31:58] I'm sure the Christian was like no I'm
[32:00] not sure about that should we should we
[32:02] go there or should we stay back and keep
[32:04] horses and after a while maybe they they
[32:07] had to surrender and start using car and
[32:09] I'm sure that every advanced and
[32:11] Technology Christian always been careful
[32:14] is they're trapped in there and and
[32:17] wanted to be on the safe path amen
[32:21] because Jesus says keep them from the
[32:24] evil so in this world there's a lot of
[32:26] evil but we have to find a balance
[32:29] without within using it without being
[32:31] consumed by it and that's a fine line
[32:34] which the Holy Ghost should lead every
[32:36] one of us amen
[32:37] now in the sermon God God's power to
[32:41] transform the Prophet says to show where
[32:44] civilization has come from basically the
[32:46] verse that I've read to you in Genesis
[32:48] chapter 4 talking about when Cain left
[32:50] the presence of God that's where they're
[32:53] starting to building tools that's where
[32:55] technology started we know that the book
[33:00] of Genesis is a book of seed a man and
[33:02] so Adam was simple people and Abel was
[33:05] simple and Seth were simple people but
[33:08] Cain when he left the presence of golly
[33:10] built a God he built a city starting
[33:13] build tools and instrument and
[33:15] technology the first hammer the first
[33:18] shovel all these things were great
[33:20] technology then I can see Adam you know
[33:24] tilling the soil with his hand and
[33:25] probably had it his hands are bleeding
[33:28] and and he's looking at on the other
[33:30] side and he see Cain with this with his
[33:32] hammer and his the shovel and and the
[33:35] tools and he was doing his feel and a
[33:37] half a day that was technology back then
[33:41] and so we know that's in the in that
[33:43] lineage and so the profit is showing us
[33:46] here to show where the civilization come
[33:48] from I don't know if I can use this yes
[33:51] thank you brother I know it's been a
[33:52] little bit challenging so thank you for
[33:55] your so we're gonna move forward to
[33:59] where we are right now here praise the
[34:03] Lord
[34:03] so mr. Schouler civilization has come
[34:05] from some of the message God's power to
[34:07] transform basically the Prophet is using
[34:09] Genesis chapter 4 verse 16 to say this
[34:12] is where civilization started
[34:14] dr. Scofield here in my Scofield Bible
[34:16] it says the first civilization noticed
[34:18] and so he's talking about at all the
[34:20] instrument and all the civilization is
[34:22] so genesis of the book of seeds and so
[34:25] and we know we are at the end time right
[34:27] now and so everything that started in
[34:28] the book of Genesis were we're reaping
[34:30] right now and it's at the climax of
[34:34] everything the devil wanted to have
[34:35] everything to devil want it to do it's
[34:38] right now we're right in the middle of
[34:39] it amen and and there's a print as a
[34:42] prophecy that the right shall overcome
[34:44] this age she will have the Christ will
[34:47] have the victory and at age true his
[34:50] bride a man so the Prophet is saying
[34:53] here that he had 6,000 years of
[34:56] deceitful rule and so in Satan's Eden he
[35:01] says that that Satan took over in
[35:04] possess a garden in Eden himself he took
[35:06] it over and now he had 6,000 years of
[35:09] deceitful rule deceiving the people
[35:11] God's children and he did them because
[35:13] they were based on free moral agency and
[35:15] Satan wanted and he took it over and he
[35:18] had six thousand years to build up his
[35:21] Eden has God at six thousand years to
[35:24] bring his Eden to our closing by deceit
[35:27] they seep of the word or the people now
[35:30] establish his own Eden in it in this
[35:33] earth and sin now he's saying is using
[35:37] deceit now us Christian we won't be
[35:40] deceived of not because that we are
[35:42] smart
[35:45] we're not smarter than two people out
[35:48] there actually I think that there's much
[35:50] more smarter people out there that we
[35:53] can be the reason why we won't be
[35:55] see it's because the word will discern
[35:58] the condition of the h and we need the
[36:02] word tonight to show the light because
[36:04] we had a prophet in this age who
[36:06] prophesied a lot of the things that's
[36:09] going on right now now the Prophet now I
[36:12] want to in light something and to bring
[36:14] a little meaning here on the word
[36:16] ideology the word ideology it's a system
[36:20] of general ideas constituional
[36:23] philosophical and political doctrine at
[36:26] the base of an individual or collective
[36:30] behavior so in ideology it's it's what
[36:34] will define the way you behave it's also
[36:39] a set of representations in which men
[36:42] live their relations to their condition
[36:44] of existence either your culture way of
[36:48] life or your belief now the Word of God
[36:51] is much more than an ideology it's the
[36:54] Word of Life but with that it will
[36:57] define the way we relate to this world
[36:59] the way we live and so in the Word of
[37:03] God there is an idea there's an it's the
[37:06] idea of God but if God has an idea now
[37:09] Satan as one as well and we want to be
[37:12] able to identify what it is exactly to
[37:15] be able to identify where Satan comes
[37:17] from where he is right now and where
[37:20] he's going I'm sure there's a lot of
[37:22] thing I'm going to say tonight you never
[37:24] heard before or probably may be and I
[37:27] want to put light tonight on a major
[37:30] shift and I'm not talking about in our
[37:34] civilization that's happened 10 years
[37:35] ago or happened 15 years ago but I'm
[37:38] talking about in the last year in the
[37:42] last two three years something is going
[37:44] on it's it's flooding our life in a
[37:47] different angle and but we don't see
[37:50] that it's all related together to bring
[37:53] about a major change that our
[37:55] civilization will never be the same
[37:57] anymore and it's changing not only the
[38:02] individual behavior but the collective
[38:05] behavior because now especially with
[38:07] social media
[38:08] it's not about ourself anymore but it's
[38:11] about what everyone think about what
[38:13] you're doing you'll take it you'll take
[38:16] a corporation who misbehave with their
[38:19] employees somebody will put take a
[38:21] picture put out on Twitter and say look
[38:23] at this company what they're doing and
[38:25] then there'll be a social uproar and the
[38:27] company will back back up and hire the
[38:31] guy again and apologize and it's so it's
[38:33] everything is about collective behavior
[38:36] it's no more you can do your little
[38:38] thing on the corner without being
[38:40] noticed because now everything ends up
[38:42] on the web and everybody criticize and
[38:44] it gets in the newspaper and on the TV
[38:48] and there there's a lot of pressure on
[38:50] the government on the police on this
[38:52] issue we should not tolerate this we
[38:54] should not be have nothing to do with
[38:57] that anymore
[38:58] and we can see the atmosphere right now
[39:00] changing where we could easily see a
[39:03] persecution setting against a Christian
[39:06] with that type of environment we're
[39:08] living right now so this is exactly the
[39:11] ideology that's establishing right now
[39:14] now a little bit as a background because
[39:17] I'm not started yet
[39:18] I want to show you that the Prophet is
[39:22] saying power of transformation that
[39:24] Satanist sprays sprayed us with is us is
[39:28] poison poison spring and that spray is
[39:32] the spray of modern understanding
[39:34] education science and civilization the
[39:39] very things that we cherish so much did
[39:41] you ever stop to think that our great
[39:43] enemy in the natural life today amongst
[39:45] the nation is communism what is the god
[39:48] of communism civilization and education
[39:52] science so the god of communism is
[39:58] science
[40:00] we know now and of course you know I'm a
[40:03] Canadian but tonight I'm gonna talk
[40:04] about America and when I say America
[40:06] wants you to I want you to include in
[40:09] your mind Canada because it's all the
[40:11] same well you might have a little bit
[40:13] difference here a little bit of a
[40:14] difference there but at the end of the
[40:16] day that that change is happening in
[40:20] America and it's changing around the
[40:22] world I just come back from South Africa
[40:24] and I did preach this sermon and they
[40:27] going through the same change over there
[40:29] I did talk to the pastor says hey you
[40:31] going through this are you going through
[40:32] that are you people facing this I mean
[40:34] I'll never it's the first time I went to
[40:37] Africa and so I didn't know this is are
[40:40] you facing this are you facing that as
[40:42] you people struggle with this yes
[40:44] brother yes brother so it's the same
[40:45] thing
[40:49] everything is global now so it's not
[40:51] about a country anymore
[40:52] so it's not about us or Canada or
[40:55] whatever it's it's it's Satan on a
[40:58] global scale amen so I don't want you I
[41:01] don't want you to think this has a can
[41:03] eight coming from a Canadian tonight but
[41:05] coming from a Christian who wants to
[41:07] just share the Word of God and the
[41:09] revelation of the hour amen
[41:11] so I want you to see here that the
[41:14] Prophet is talking about science and I'm
[41:16] going fast and through these things
[41:18] because I want to move quickly to our
[41:20] topic tonight but it's basically that
[41:22] communism is not it's not political but
[41:25] it's the spirit and it says America is
[41:28] eat up with it it's in the churches it's
[41:30] in the people it's in the business it's
[41:32] everywhere communism the spirit of it
[41:35] it's in schools it's in homes everywhere
[41:38] what does communism lay on science
[41:43] education that's their God whatever
[41:48] happens in a society then you'll listen
[41:51] to CNN or Fox or whatever TV station and
[41:54] then they'll bring an expert there's a
[41:57] hurt quake they'll bring an expert
[41:59] there's a there's a flu spread in a
[42:04] certain area who do they bring on the TV
[42:08] do they bring a minister to to pray for
[42:10] the nation
[42:11] no they bring an expert
[42:13] and so we just don't realize how much we
[42:15] lean on science how much America and
[42:18] across the world
[42:19] everything there's a crisis somewhere we
[42:22] bring somebody who's educated and we'll
[42:25] lean on science to to tell us how we
[42:28] should think and how we should view the
[42:31] situation and so this nation is entirely
[42:35] even though the people are going to
[42:37] church they don't want to hear what gods
[42:39] that want to say they want to know what
[42:41] science says and so the prophet in the
[42:45] fourth vision he had prophesied a major
[42:48] change now I don't have time tonight to
[42:50] show how that's how that change came
[42:54] about but I'm probably just trying to
[42:56] paraphrase it but you're the Prophet at
[42:58] seven vision and the fourth vision was
[43:01] about the Ford vision showed the great
[43:04] advances in science that would come
[43:07] after the Second World War so the
[43:10] Prophet have seen in 1933 the great
[43:14] advances in science that would come
[43:18] after the Second World War and that
[43:21] great advance in science came majorly
[43:25] true the USA and one of the reason is
[43:30] because all the pious and the elite of
[43:33] scientific of Germany all these SS and
[43:37] the doctors and the highest level they
[43:40] were smuggle in the u.s. the Nuremberg
[43:43] trial was just a theater they just
[43:48] brought those guys that didn't want them
[43:50] anyway but they it was called Operation
[43:53] Paperclip
[43:54] and they brought 1500 scientists from
[43:57] Germany the reason why the u.s. did that
[43:59] it didn't want Russia to get their hands
[44:02] on them and so they brought him in the
[44:04] US and actually the first leader of the
[44:07] spacial spatial program was was a
[44:10] annexed Nazi forgot his name tonight but
[44:15] he was deleting and he was the father of
[44:17] the of NASA he was a German and you all
[44:21] the spatial program was X people from X
[44:25] see and so the great advance in science
[44:29] came and was led by the US now it's
[44:35] changed here so I want you to remember
[44:38] this and so the prophet saw here the
[44:41] great advancing science that will come
[44:44] after second world war because basically
[44:46] when when the Second World War started
[44:49] British Empire had bases everywhere they
[44:53] were in Palestine they were in South
[44:55] Africa they were ever in Australia they
[44:58] were ruling in many many places but when
[45:00] the Second World War ended British
[45:03] Empire collapsed and the u.s. took over
[45:05] and that's why you have military base US
[45:08] military base across the world it's
[45:10] because they are running the world today
[45:13] and this is a this is the fulfilling of
[45:15] the prophecy of Revelation 13 when the
[45:18] Bible says then then I saw another beast
[45:21] rise up from the earth you know the
[45:24] first beast rose up from the water which
[45:26] was Europe the Vatican from many many
[45:29] people but the second V the prophecies
[45:31] was USA rose up from the earth where
[45:34] there was no people and exercise the
[45:38] authority and the power of the first
[45:42] piece so if you think about Rome the
[45:44] first beast who had who had soldiers
[45:47] everywhere around over the known world
[45:49] then and they were exercising Authority
[45:53] now the u.s. is not spreading democracy
[45:56] overseas that's a lie there are
[45:58] basically exercising the authority of
[46:01] the Vatican that's the Bible and and
[46:04] that's where the money comes from and
[46:06] that's worth exactly forcing every
[46:09] government they'll either over troll
[46:12] government invade nations to make sure
[46:15] that the country will align with the
[46:18] Vatican's banking system and so Libya is
[46:22] one of them they try to overthrow in
[46:24] Syria they did it in Iraq they're trying
[46:26] to in Israel out right now and they keep
[46:28] trying to overthrow government after
[46:30] government to bring these countries in
[46:33] line.we Rome for the money actually in
[46:39] Libya Gaddafi was trying to open the
[46:42] world not a world bank but a central
[46:44] bank for Africa based on gold and I
[46:49] would that would have freed Africa from
[46:51] the World Bank which is run by the
[46:54] Vatican and so because cat if you try to
[46:57] do that what they do they bombed the
[46:59] country they kill them basically killing
[47:02] everyone who is not worshiping the Beast
[47:06] now there's many way you can worship the
[47:09] Beast the nation has to worship the
[47:11] Beast with the currency people as to
[47:15] worship the Beast you know we know
[47:17] there's the mark of the beast which is
[47:18] where there's a religious smart but
[47:21] there's many many many aspects of that
[47:24] global worship of the Vatican this is
[47:27] just a little parenthesis but just to
[47:31] show you how the US America is leading
[47:36] the world in every in every way except I
[47:42] don't have time to go through this
[47:44] tonight except you know the Prophet
[47:47] prophesied three curtains the bamboo
[47:50] curtains China the iron curtain Russia
[47:54] and a purple curtain which is room but
[47:58] now who exercised the authority of Rome
[48:00] it's the Prophet says watch that purple
[48:03] curtain rising in the United States
[48:06] because that's where Rome is raising his
[48:09] head it's true the US Empire and and and
[48:13] have chewed all this military base
[48:14] around the world that is why you know
[48:17] the Prophet said that in 1960 prophesied
[48:20] three curtains you're still reading the
[48:23] newspaper and it's still about the US
[48:25] Russia and China
[48:27] we're in 2019 and it's still this is
[48:30] still mainstream front-page event u.s.
[48:35] against China u.s. against Russia three
[48:38] curtains purple curtains
[48:41] Iren bamboo China Russia US Vatican NATO
[48:46] name it this is all the same thing now
[48:52] we've been warned by this message that
[48:56] Satan would invade America in the world
[48:58] true Hollywood amen
[49:02] now we've seen that and we have quotes
[49:08] we have quotes here that says then you
[49:11] notice he couldn't get in here to the
[49:13] ministry so the Phase II done was to
[49:15] come into Hollywood out there he set up
[49:17] his headquarters over here in Hollywood
[49:20] the devil landed back here a few years
[49:23] ago 15 or 20 years ago that since 54 so
[49:26] he's talking around the 30s with his
[49:29] great army and when in hit Hollywood
[49:31] California and he's invaded the United
[49:34] States with his demon powers now for
[49:38] years and even I started preaching 20
[49:39] years ago and I did preach a whole lot
[49:42] about you know the influence of music
[49:43] influence of the movies and radio and
[49:46] all this stuff that comes from Hollywood
[49:48] and the Prophet has warned us and and
[49:50] that and I and we put so much and Wow
[49:54] I'll put it on me tonight while I was
[49:57] preaching and warning people something
[50:00] else came up from the same area and we
[50:04] didn't notice it now if I show you these
[50:08] icons I'm sure I'm sure you know about
[50:11] all these now
[50:15] I want to show you something here as I
[50:19] said we're going through a major shift
[50:21] in our civilization right now if you
[50:24] look at all these icon and I will make a
[50:26] list shortly
[50:28] they are basically changing the way we
[50:33] go about our life now the Prophet says
[50:39] here again an invasion of the United
[50:42] States is again warning us the political
[50:44] world is gone our nation is broke
[50:47] remember that brother branham said thus
[50:49] says the Lord our nation is dibala SHhhh
[50:51] it'll never rise she is gone like all
[50:54] the rest of the nations it's the
[50:56] greatest nation in the world standing
[50:58] today but it's the very seed of the
[50:59] devil has been planted into the hearts
[51:02] of the people how he'd come into
[51:04] Hollywood how it got it out into the
[51:07] people and begin to to this and you
[51:09] can't call you can't tell them nothing
[51:11] and I skip one paragraph she is gone she
[51:15] is invaded the spirit of communism ice
[51:19] took over now the spirit of communism
[51:22] what it is is Education and science not
[51:26] God science
[51:28] amen so he's talking about the invasion
[51:31] of the United States true Hollywood but
[51:35] now he's saying something here he's
[51:37] talking about the spirit of communism
[51:39] have we seen communism in the movies
[51:41] what is it where is that spirit of
[51:44] science well here it is
[51:50] want to show you this picture here or
[51:53] California and we know it Hollywood is
[51:56] around this area but there's another
[51:57] area and we know that
[52:01] the Prophet is said that Satan has
[52:03] establishes a headquarters now if you
[52:06] study that's not my topic but Lord
[52:08] willing I'll preach on that's Saturday
[52:10] night at brother Paul their progress the
[52:13] progression of Satan's seat because the
[52:15] Prophet when he's talking about Satan's
[52:17] seat Babylon or Satan's headquarters
[52:20] it's always the same way it means the
[52:22] same thing it's basically where the
[52:24] devil has his headquarter and the
[52:26] prophets essence and seven Church ages
[52:28] he says his headquarters for a natural
[52:31] thing not just like spiritually
[52:33] symbolically you know really like quite
[52:37] really far like indirect no the Prophet
[52:39] says is headquarters for the you human
[52:43] affairs like he was in Babylon of
[52:47] Nebuchadnezzar then he moved to Prague
[52:51] Anna's then he moved to Paris Rome Paris
[52:54] and then he landed in Hollywood the
[52:57] Prophet he said he said he's set up his
[52:59] headquarters there actually they even
[53:02] have in Hollywood a court named bad of
[53:05] the Babylon court and to have that huge
[53:08] Ark with all this Babylonian symbolism
[53:13] and in the movie and the occult errs a
[53:15] lot of satanic occult signs and is a lot
[53:19] of Babylonian because it's the same
[53:22] spirit people think it's not witchcraft
[53:24] they think it's it's entertainment it's
[53:27] not entertainment it's witchcraft they
[53:30] don't realize it because in Africa in
[53:33] Haiti my father-in-law is a missionary
[53:35] in Haiti goes there often and the voodoo
[53:38] is not entertainment it's a real
[53:40] religion it's really it's a real satanic
[53:42] worship but in America everything is
[53:45] disguise under entertainment Harry
[53:48] Potter and this movie about zombies and
[53:50] drinking blood in movies it's
[53:53] entertainment but it's real witchcraft
[53:55] don't even don't don't even touch this
[53:57] don't even look at that kind of thing
[54:01] it's pure witchcraft it's just a way to
[54:03] introduce it to the form of
[54:05] entertainment
[54:06] now there's another city

[56:46] take you away from this world but I want
[56:48] you to be keep or kept from the evil one
[56:54] amen
[56:58] I'm preaching to you tonight I got an
[57:00] iPad sitting there a MacBook sitting
[57:03] there is still an a paper look to touch
[57:07] its paper it's actually you know when
[57:10] you turn it there's a noise and and when
[57:12] you turn it you can read the next page
[57:14] it's called a paper Bible it's still
[57:16] available but now everything becomes
[57:21] electronic right so our life is
[57:24] different now
[57:28] Tesla has done a major shift in how the
[57:34] car industry works now if you think that
[57:38] all these corporation has what we want
[57:41] to call it spontaneous success I don't
[57:45] believe in spontaneous success in
[57:48] America you know it's the land of dream
[57:51] it's the land where you can establish
[57:54] invent something create something you're
[57:57] a genius and you become rich overnight
[57:58] we like to think that United States is a
[58:01] country like that but I don't believe it
[58:04] I don't believe it so there's a lot of
[58:07] smart guy who has invented amazing
[58:10] things that died on the shelf because it
[58:14] was not part of the plan our
[58:18] civilization is led by Satan if you
[58:23] believe that Steve Jobs
[58:24] really invented a computer in his garage
[58:27] and changed her world with it you're
[58:32] still a dreamer why did he sell his
[58:35] first computer $600 in 66
[58:39] if was just a spontaneous success if you
[58:44] believe Mark Zuckerberg invented
[58:47] Facebook into college and overnight he
[58:51] was able to buy millions and millions of
[58:53] dollars of servers to become a worldwide
[58:57] network in a couple of years you're a
[59:00] dreamer this is not spontaneous success
[59:04] this was we called programs success
[59:08] people don't know that Facebook was
[59:10] funded by the CIA you didn't know that
[59:14] that's not conspiracy theory that's news
[59:16] Forbes Forbes magazine tells you that
[59:19] Mark Zuckerberg went out the CIA would
[59:22] have Facebook would never be in
[59:24] existence all the millions of dollar
[59:26] came from the CIA basically because they
[59:29] know that US we are dreamers we like to
[59:32] believe that a young boy in a college
[59:35] invented that and so because we swallow
[59:37] that such so easily like wow man like
[59:41] this guy he wanted to to to meet girls
[59:44] in college so he invented this
[59:45] networking now it's a worldwide thing
[59:47] imagine everybody can achieve everybody
[59:50] can have a success no this is program
[59:52] success it's made by design
[59:56] why the CIA invested in Facebook if you
[1:00:00] don't know about spying but that's
[1:00:01] another topic how big how Google became
[1:00:07] overnight to a company like that it was
[1:00:09] funded by the NSA
[1:00:12] that's the spying agency of the US this
[1:00:15] is not conspiracy this is a real
[1:00:17] financial news just people are not
[1:00:19] looking into it it's just like oh okay
[1:00:22] and it's a Ron it to help Google now
[1:00:24] Google isn't everything it's in cars as
[1:00:28] algorithm it's Anna medical field it's
[1:00:31] you name a certain area Google is in it
[1:00:33] already and is leading Netflix has
[1:00:39] changed the way people look at movie
[1:00:41] Tesla has changed away you know we talk
[1:00:44] about driverless car Tesla brought a
[1:00:48] major shift with his auto pilot Adobe
[1:00:52] changed the way we manipulate picture
[1:00:54] Huber changed the way we taxi around
[1:00:57] used to be it was just hell a taxi pay
[1:01:01] five bucks cash an untraceable ride
[1:01:04] uber brought it to another level there
[1:01:06] now every ride there's a trace
[1:01:10] even in Quebec the taxis industry was
[1:01:14] all legalized by Union it was a well
[1:01:17] protected business you became like
[1:01:19] criminals and they forced the government
[1:01:22] how come a company who lose by the way
[1:01:25] you bur lose a billion not a million at
[1:01:29] nine hundred and sixty million dollar
[1:01:31] they lose every three months
[1:01:36] they just went on Wall Street 44 $45
[1:01:41] stock and there kept their stock even
[1:01:46] though they're losing Fame so they're
[1:01:48] making pretty much they have
[1:01:52] they're losing 1 billion every three
[1:01:54] months and they're still in business
[1:01:55] where the money comes from
[1:01:58] it's Silicon Valley I want you to see
[1:02:01] the big picture tonight
[1:02:03] all these corporation are touching every
[1:02:06] area of our life to change it but I want
[1:02:11] to show you the link between all that
[1:02:13] tonight Airbnb is changing is
[1:02:15] challenging the hotel industry will they
[1:02:17] succeed they will because it comes from
[1:02:20] Silicon Valley Instagram Instagram has
[1:02:24] changed the way we see ourselves the way
[1:02:26] we broadcast ourselves Facebook Twitter
[1:02:29] is the same thing it used to be that a
[1:02:32] young girl would have a new dress and
[1:02:33] she would have to to have some approval
[1:02:37] or some reflection of how does she look
[1:02:40] she would basically have to get out of
[1:02:42] our room and walk in the living room and
[1:02:46] parade a little bit like so mom what do
[1:02:49] you think mommy's like yeah
[1:02:58] like your likes our unlikes came from
[1:03:03] your home
[1:03:03] and that's the way it worked it that's
[1:03:06] where you in and you could bring this to
[1:03:08] the next level and let's say you got
[1:03:10] dad's approval mom's approval you come
[1:03:11] to church and then after church your
[1:03:13] glass like you're waiting for all the
[1:03:15] your friends to say something right
[1:03:16] you're waiting for likes now Facebook
[1:03:19] has brought it to another level or
[1:03:21] Instagram where now is friends friends
[1:03:24] it define what friends doesn't mean
[1:03:27] anything anymore right so it's it's it's
[1:03:31] this we call major psychological change
[1:03:35] toxic change because people the new
[1:03:38] generation is becoming mentally mentally
[1:03:42] challenged or insane because of the way
[1:03:45] they reflect themselves the way they get
[1:03:47] their creation appreciation they
[1:03:49] measured himself with people they don't
[1:03:50] even know the community has become so
[1:03:53] big now it's everyone and it's nobody
[1:03:57] it's not little changes it's huge
[1:04:00] changes but it's all happening at the
[1:04:03] same time
[1:04:04] twitter twitter has brought that where i
[1:04:09] was talking about a collective behavior
[1:04:12] you're not happy about something in the
[1:04:14] restaurant you find a rap in your
[1:04:15] chicken burger put it on twitter the
[1:04:19] earth's gonna shake it used to be you
[1:04:23] find a rapping your burger and you just
[1:04:25] go back home crying nobody will ever
[1:04:27] know about it and the restaurant could
[1:04:30] serve that every week and there would be
[1:04:32] no hurt quake but now it's not about
[1:04:35] individual behavior anymore it's about a
[1:04:36] collective behavior and it's by design
[1:04:39] it's by design because they have a view
[1:04:43] to where they want to bring that society
[1:04:46] there's an ideology behind that that's
[1:04:49] my topic tonight
[1:04:51] now eBay I always hate it even
[1:04:55] because eBay you know these days
[1:04:58] after a while you know they new people
[1:05:00] hate it to bid so you had this instant
[1:05:02] buy right by now but the Buy Now was
[1:05:05] always too expensive I never liked eBay
[1:05:09] because I didn't never like to bid and
[1:05:11] have to wait three days to see if I
[1:05:13] could purchase it
[1:05:15] to see if you win your bid and then you
[1:05:17] have to restart over I didn't like it
[1:05:19] but when Amazon came oh my goodness I'm
[1:05:23] prime so if he Bay didn't get you Amazon
[1:05:30] got you cheap now two days later you
[1:05:36] don't two days later is now when you
[1:05:38] realize you win the bid now two days
[1:05:39] later it's in your mailing box it's
[1:05:42] yours you don't like it put a stamp on
[1:05:48] it and send it back for free it brings
[1:05:53] shopping to another level I like it um
[1:05:58] and as you see I'm not afraid of
[1:06:01] technology I'm quite you know a built
[1:06:04] website I use Photoshop I make video I'm
[1:06:06] a I'm I'm like that I learned quickly
[1:06:08] I'm not afraid of that I use these
[1:06:11] devices I learned so fast but when I
[1:06:12] made that study I was shocked you know
[1:06:17] that study could come from someone who
[1:06:19] doesn't know about nothing about
[1:06:20] technology and he can barely use a
[1:06:22] microwave with a dial on it I always
[1:06:27] laugh about my mom because she has this
[1:06:29] one is dial on
[1:06:33] now the brothers talking to you tonight
[1:06:36] is well versed in technology but when I
[1:06:40] made that study I was shocked I remember
[1:06:42] I mean my office studying and I let me
[1:06:45] back in my chair and I roll back and I
[1:06:47] was like whoa
[1:06:50] and now that's not exciting anymore
[1:06:52] because I understood there's a religion
[1:06:55] behind that and I got there hurry up
[1:06:57] okay so the other half we know but I
[1:07:02] won't spend too much time on it because
[1:07:04] the first half is really what's changing
[1:07:05] our life but of course no computer would
[1:07:07] run without Intel or AMD which is from
[1:07:10] Silicon Valley HP computer electronic
[1:07:13] art II a sport pioneers in video games
[1:07:16] they change the way we play you know
[1:07:18] youssef these little flimsy boring
[1:07:21] little game until EA sport came of
[1:07:24] course nowadays Ubisoft there's those
[1:07:25] big big big big company but EA sport
[1:07:27] from Silicon Valley really the
[1:07:30] electronic art really opened up with
[1:07:31] Cisco all the server's all the the
[1:07:33] switches all the anyway all these
[1:07:37] corporations and probably much more I
[1:07:39] forget probably much more now let's move
[1:07:41] on to what's really behind it I really
[1:07:44] had to move quickly I'll skip some of
[1:07:45] the thing but I think I got your
[1:07:47] attention
[1:07:48] how many have heard this term before
[1:07:52] raise your hands okay we got two person
[1:07:55] who heard the term trance humanism I'm
[1:07:58] French so I'm making a big effort here
[1:08:02] transhumanism term is it weird
[1:08:05] everywhere I go I ask the term and it
[1:08:08] will always have like a few hints coming
[1:08:10] up people say they know what's is it the
[1:08:12] rest of it never heard of the term
[1:08:15] and that is the religion that's behind
[1:08:19] all these corporations they don't they
[1:08:22] all believe in that they all push it and
[1:08:25] all their technology they're pushing is
[1:08:28] run by this idea of transhumanism now
[1:08:31] let's let's find out what it is
[1:08:40] the pioneer of this idea transform an
[1:08:43] ism was Nikolai
[1:08:46] Theodore ah've was a Russian Orthodox
[1:08:49] Christian philosopher who was part of
[1:08:51] the Russian cosmicism movement and a
[1:08:54] precursor of transhumanism punitive
[1:08:57] advocated radical life extension
[1:09:00] physical immortality and even
[1:09:03] resurrection of the Dead using
[1:09:05] scientific methods
[1:09:10] gone and more of this description
[1:09:13] transhumanism is an international
[1:09:16] philosophical movement that advocates
[1:09:18] for the transformation of the human
[1:09:20] condition by developing and making
[1:09:23] widely available sophisticated
[1:09:25] technologies to greatly enhance human
[1:09:29] intellect and physiology
[1:09:34] transhumanism consider
[1:09:37] certain aspects of the human condition
[1:09:40] such as disability suffering illness
[1:09:43] aging or death as undesirable
[1:09:48] Trane's animism is the promotion of the
[1:09:51] improvement of the human condition
[1:09:52] through life enhancing technologies
[1:09:55] aimed at eliminating aging and
[1:09:58] increasing intellectual physical or
[1:10:02] psychological capacity
[1:10:07] and I probably lost you but stay with me
[1:10:14] so it's basically the use of science to
[1:10:18] embedder
[1:10:20] humanity
[1:10:22] but more than humanity the human body
[1:10:27] basically saying that as we were created
[1:10:30] we are not enough
[1:10:33] but we need science and technology to be
[1:10:36] smarter to perform more to be more
[1:10:40] effective basically saying that the way
[1:10:43] we were created is not enough
[1:10:49] now he got it runs much deeper than that
[1:10:51] so let's just follow me
[1:10:55] transhumanism is article inspired
[1:10:58] academic and popular interest GT Bernal
[1:11:01] a crystal it crystallographer at
[1:11:04] Cambridge wrote the book the world of
[1:11:07] flesh and the devil that must be a
[1:11:09] really good book the world of flesh and
[1:11:11] the devil in 1929 in which he speculated
[1:11:15] on the prospect of space colonization
[1:11:17] and radical changes to human bodies and
[1:11:21] intelligence true Bionic implants a
[1:11:24] cognitive enhancement these ideas have
[1:11:28] been common transhumanists themes ever
[1:11:31] since I'll pause you because maybe you
[1:11:35] don't follow me and if with everything
[1:11:39] I've read here you don't follow me yet
[1:11:41] it's on purpose
[1:11:44] now let's go back to the first computer
[1:11:47] the first computer I think was IBM and
[1:11:50] it was it was in a big big big hall and
[1:11:53] it was super big making a law to eat
[1:11:57] heat and was not the shadow or the power
[1:12:02] that I have in this phone right it's
[1:12:07] nothing that I could take with me after
[1:12:09] that they brought it to another level
[1:12:10] that's where Apple invented the personal
[1:12:13] computer they brought it from such a big
[1:12:15] machine to such a smaller one that you
[1:12:19] could have in your house but then that
[1:12:21] was not enough because we don't know the
[1:12:24] endgame we just follow along but tonight
[1:12:28] you're about to discover where they want
[1:12:30] to go with that and that's where you'll
[1:12:32] have to decide where you want to stop
[1:12:36] because we follow along you know if if I
[1:12:40] was here today and you have no clue
[1:12:43] where I'm going and where I want to be
[1:12:45] one of what I want to do you follow me
[1:12:47] but if somebody comes from home and he's
[1:12:50] sitting here tonight he's like watch it
[1:12:52] people are ignorant they don't know
[1:12:54] Steve you know you follow me following
[1:12:58] me of course your pastor trust me so you
[1:12:59] trust me so you follow me alone
[1:13:02] right but let's say nobody knows me and
[1:13:04] I'm starting a sermon in that but if
[1:13:07] somebody knows me and he knows what kind
[1:13:10] of a doctrine I'm trying to establish he
[1:13:12] sees where I push my pawns he says look
[1:13:16] you push this here it's like a chess
[1:13:18] game if you don't know if you don't know
[1:13:21] how to play chess
[1:13:22] you pretty much realize you're how do
[1:13:24] you call it checkmate now you call it
[1:13:25] when it's finished checkmate
[1:13:28] okay if you play a good again against a
[1:13:31] good player you're not a good player
[1:13:33] you realize you checkmate when he says
[1:13:35] checkmate he's like oh my goodness
[1:13:37] suddenly no it was not sudden when he
[1:13:41] move his first pawn he knew where his
[1:13:44] last pawn would be and you'd be dead but
[1:13:48] if you don't know how to play you like
[1:13:50] be moving this is like oh and you're
[1:13:54] having fun right I know there's a lot of
[1:13:57] that just Larry here I'm sure and the
[1:14:01] guys pretty saunas like soups like oh
[1:14:03] and you're having fun until he's like oh
[1:14:07] no that's not fun anymore
[1:14:10] now you had fun until the last hit
[1:14:13] that's not fun anymore
[1:14:14] well science is the same thing we are
[1:14:18] playing along and when that's what am i
[1:14:21] and when I did that study and I back off
[1:14:23] in my chair I didn't have fun anymore
[1:14:25] the guy was like
[1:14:27] ah that's the checkmate thing that's
[1:14:31] where they're going so that's what this
[1:14:34] is what I want to show you tonight so
[1:14:36] they brought the pork a big computer
[1:14:38] fill your room personal computer that's
[1:14:40] quite heavy to bring but you at least
[1:14:42] can put in your home then they brought
[1:14:43] the laptop right laptop you can carry in
[1:14:46] a bag but still you know there were that
[1:14:48] thick heavy and then they put it smaller
[1:14:53] and then they came with the tablet and
[1:14:54] then know that the phone first
[1:14:56] you know the phone used to be a thing
[1:14:59] you could talk with it was amazing you
[1:15:02] basically could dial and you could talk
[1:15:06] we know that nobody talks on the phone
[1:15:08] anymore
[1:15:09] because we use it for every other reason
[1:15:11] than to talk right but it used to be you
[1:15:15] know a device's where we could talk now
[1:15:17] they brought the personal computer to in
[1:15:21] this is much more powerful than the
[1:15:24] first big computer you brought in your
[1:15:26] home who costs a towels at $3,000 and
[1:15:29] can do nothing like this can do but they
[1:15:35] didn't stop there then they brought the
[1:15:38] watch and that's where they changed the
[1:15:40] name they call it wearable technology
[1:15:43] it's not technology you carry anymore
[1:15:46] it's now technology that you wear will
[1:15:50] this be finished in no the endgame is
[1:15:54] not to wear it
[1:15:57] and honestly for myself even before I
[1:16:00] was aware of that
[1:16:01] when they came with that Apple I like
[1:16:05] the Apple product I think they're
[1:16:06] they're good and they all synchronized
[1:16:07] together blah blah blah but when they
[1:16:09] came to the Apple watch I'm right now
[1:16:10] I'm not wearing that I just don't want
[1:16:13] to wear a computer so I can't I've still
[1:16:15] have this needle even though I'm well
[1:16:18] versed in technology I'm still using
[1:16:20] this regular watch because in my mind I
[1:16:26] don't know if something inside of me
[1:16:27] just said and and if you have one it's
[1:16:29] all fine it's just my opinion nothing
[1:16:31] spiritual but it's something just in
[1:16:33] suddenly clickers like this is going too
[1:16:36] far now I didn't know what I know now
[1:16:39] but now I realize why I felt this way
[1:16:42] now
[1:16:43] after that they brought the Google
[1:16:45] glasses I mean you've heard about the
[1:16:48] Google glasses well some of you heard
[1:16:50] about it do you know why did you release
[1:16:52] it on the market because they say people
[1:16:54] are not ready for that because now the
[1:16:56] Google glasses is those glasses you wear
[1:16:58] where you have a screen here where you
[1:17:00] talk to show me this Rhodri little and
[1:17:03] you have pretty much face time you can
[1:17:06] Skype you can talk to people it's a
[1:17:08] computer that you wear on your cleats
[1:17:09] and on your glasses and you just do this
[1:17:11] and you basically how your computer is
[1:17:13] there it's technology you wear so the
[1:17:16] watch the glasses and then it kind of
[1:17:19] stop and Google Google pull the out of
[1:17:22] the market that's why you didn't hear
[1:17:23] about it because people were not buying
[1:17:25] it because humanly speaking people are
[1:17:27] people are not moving fast enough for
[1:17:30] where they want to go and they've
[1:17:33] started to give that a sell down into
[1:17:35] corporate and company you know you're
[1:17:37] working on the chain production and you
[1:17:38] have your glasses and you have a
[1:17:40] question and it answers to you and so
[1:17:42] they work they use it at their at the
[1:17:45] job
[1:17:45] now let's you move on quickly so that's
[1:17:47] the idea of transhumanism is to now
[1:17:51] since we have all these devices have you
[1:17:53] realized something is happening to us we
[1:17:55] forget things all the time
[1:17:57] we need reminders for everything like
[1:18:00] remind me to breathe I mean almost
[1:18:04] right we and so as we are weakening
[1:18:10] technology is filling in
[1:18:12] now how why are we getting more weak
[1:18:16] well the prophets spoke about hybrid
[1:18:19] food our body tearing down Christian
[1:18:23] body as non-believer is no different
[1:18:26] where we're falling apart prophets
[1:18:29] talking about our rot the brain cells it
[1:18:31] comes to a place where the whole nation
[1:18:33] the whole world not only this nation but
[1:18:35] everything everywhere mentally gone
[1:18:37] neurotic nervous even Christians are
[1:18:40] nervous we have peace in our hearth but
[1:18:43] two-zip physically we we have that
[1:18:46] tension it seems like we cannot cope
[1:18:48] with with what we used to cope we used
[1:18:51] we seems like we cannot take the
[1:18:52] pressure and so technology is filling in
[1:18:55] technology is feeling it
[1:18:59] and something is going on as we're week
[1:19:02] name we rely more and more on science
[1:19:05] and it becomes that it answers every one
[1:19:08] of our needs
[1:19:10] and okay it's fine but I want to in
[1:19:14] light to you the spiritual trap in there
[1:19:17] because there is evil in that we want to
[1:19:21] discern to evil are you with me man is
[1:19:24] rotting in their flesh if they're going
[1:19:26] through the middle age between 2025
[1:19:28] years their brain cells are running to
[1:19:30] so basically prophet says we aren't even
[1:19:31] mentally weakening because of food so
[1:19:34] they basically destroyed our food to
[1:19:36] make us weak after that to give us the
[1:19:39] remedy they wanted to give us to us to
[1:19:40] start
[1:19:43] this doesn't happen by chance this is
[1:19:45] this happens by design
[1:19:47] now the first self-described
[1:19:50] transhumanist met formally in the early
[1:19:53] 1980s at the University of no Le Satan's
[1:19:59] headquarters the University of
[1:20:02] California Los Angeles which became the
[1:20:04] main center of transhumanists thought
[1:20:11] and they made like a TV program Breaking
[1:20:15] Away 1980 experimental film which the
[1:20:17] theme of humans breaking away from their
[1:20:19] biological limitations and the earth
[1:20:22] gravity as they head into space so
[1:20:25] transhumanism thought is to break away
[1:20:27] from our biological limitations and to
[1:20:32] flee in space go to Mars go to the moon
[1:20:36] and and so is that's why the Nazi were
[1:20:40] leading the space program because that
[1:20:42] ideology came from the Nets he came from
[1:20:45] the Babylon so it's all it's a satanic
[1:20:48] thing and deer call that's why you have
[1:20:50] so many movies and so many stories about
[1:20:53] about alien invasion and in in in space
[1:20:59] travel in Star Trek and Star Wars and
[1:21:02] everything about space and
[1:21:05] it's a bunch of nonsense so an old story
[1:21:10] just to let you to see that the seed has
[1:21:12] been laying long time ago we didn't see
[1:21:14] it
[1:21:15] 1931 amazing story publishes the Jameson
[1:21:18] satellite and Neal are joined story
[1:21:19] about a man whose corpse is sent to
[1:21:21] orbit where he stayed stays close to
[1:21:24] absolute zero for millions of years on
[1:21:26] still a race of cyborgs discover it
[1:21:28] discover it defrost it and install it in
[1:21:31] the body of a robot so you know why
[1:21:35] wildest nay froze his body he had cancer
[1:21:39] he asked for his body to be froze when
[1:21:41] you heard about that body got freeze
[1:21:44] waiting - waiting for science to
[1:21:46] discover the cure for cancer
[1:21:49] Walt Disney was a big transhumanism 30
[1:21:53] degree 33 degree Freemason a cultic
[1:21:57] satanic dissing a should be out of every
[1:22:00] Christian home they planted the seed of
[1:22:03] transhumanism long time ago talking
[1:22:06] about robots talking about all kinds of
[1:22:09] nonsense influencing seeding a new
[1:22:11] generation to go in that direction but
[1:22:14] that's not my topic we got all kind of
[1:22:17] movie that went through the years
[1:22:18] Frankenstein
[1:22:21] Robocop whoops it switched to my
[1:22:23] computer and switched to yours
[1:22:27] Robocop Terminator transformer all these
[1:22:30] movies what's happening with these
[1:22:32] movies wall-e
[1:22:33] its movies that basically you
[1:22:37] emotionally attached to a robot that's
[1:22:40] like a human being
[1:22:42] the robot is talking he has almost
[1:22:45] emotion he's a Nero and at the end of
[1:22:47] the movie he dies and you feel pain and
[1:22:50] you feel sorry for a machine that's
[1:22:52] dying that's what we call subliminal
[1:22:55] message but it's to make the ditch
[1:22:58] between robots and human beings to make
[1:23:01] it more narrow to bring mixed feeling
[1:23:04] that we start feeling emotion we because
[1:23:07] naturally we feel resentment towards
[1:23:09] robots and stuff like that a machine
[1:23:13] that talks to us now every day you call
[1:23:15] to the bank you're talking to a machine
[1:23:18] it's a robot of course I have no arms no
[1:23:20] legs but it's a robot we will will
[1:23:23] discover I have to hurry up but we will
[1:23:25] discover what's there what's the
[1:23:27] intelligence behind that
[1:23:30] now I told you that Tesla you know Elon
[1:23:34] you know heard about Elon Musk I'm sure
[1:23:37] you heard about him because he's he's
[1:23:40] smart to play with social media and he
[1:23:42] likes to make shocking declaration to
[1:23:45] get a lot of publicity but he's not just
[1:23:48] the one who supposedly invented Tesla
[1:23:51] cars or he's maybe just the front face I
[1:23:54] don't know I just don't believe
[1:23:56] everything they're telling because
[1:23:57] they're lying half of the time but Tesla
[1:24:00] is not about the cars only but he's also
[1:24:03] have another company called space X
[1:24:07] so he's talking about promoting cars
[1:24:10] that will drive a robot will pretty much
[1:24:12] drive you which fulfill the prophecy of
[1:24:15] a prophet long time ago the events of
[1:24:19] Science Buddies all saw promoting we
[1:24:21] intend to launch launched people to Mars
[1:24:23] in 2014 so I easy remember now the
[1:24:28] transhumanism thought is space travel
[1:24:32] and challenge are Bialik biological
[1:24:35] limitation by science
[1:24:39] and you unmask is doing both
[1:24:44] doing these cars and he has space six
[1:24:49] for space travel which I don't believe
[1:24:53] is really possible I believe there's a
[1:24:56] lot of lying into that NASA NASA has
[1:24:59] been caught lying so many times and but
[1:25:04] no wasting of time and conspiracy theory
[1:25:07] we'll find out the truth on the other
[1:25:08] side but I don't believe there's a lot
[1:25:10] of truth in what they're saying and the
[1:25:12] reason why you want to know why all the
[1:25:16] space travel is nothing else than a new
[1:25:19] Tower of Babel as judgment is coming
[1:25:24] Genesis 11 I've said that for years
[1:25:28] all that matsa foolishness of Mars and
[1:25:30] space travel and going to Star Wars Star
[1:25:34] Trek all that nonsense it's all
[1:25:36] imagination but as they said build us a
[1:25:41] city and a tower whose top may reach
[1:25:43] unto heaven
[1:25:46] and so by fear of judgment they wanted
[1:25:49] to build a tower that could touch heaven
[1:25:51] so they could flee judgment and that's
[1:25:54] exactly the idea behind all of you are
[1:25:56] trying of course they're trying all
[1:25:58] they're trying of space travel but there
[1:26:01] are so many of the video they put out
[1:26:03] there that are fake and they are so
[1:26:05] badly faked
[1:26:06] um I'm not a video specialist but I do I
[1:26:09] do enough video montage and enough
[1:26:12] photoshop to be able to to see when it's
[1:26:15] badly faked and it's weird that they can
[1:26:18] have so much billion that's I can have
[1:26:20] billions of dollar and make so peep or
[1:26:22] poor fakery video me and my son we
[1:26:27] borrowed the IMAX you know NASA are
[1:26:30] really big on NASA you say nuts and
[1:26:33] that's how I don't know you to say that
[1:26:34] in French we say NASA then s its Lisette
[1:26:38] that's why I struggle
[1:26:41] they like to be an IMAX pretty much they
[1:26:44] like to they like to do a lot of
[1:26:46] promotion about their what they're doing
[1:26:48] because they want to feel the people's
[1:26:50] mind with that died this idea that we
[1:26:52] can reach Evan
[1:26:54] now so I we've all rode me and my son a
[1:26:59] bunch of imax DVD of all the launch of
[1:27:02] the telescope and the lunch of this and
[1:27:05] launch of that satellite and we put that
[1:27:07] on the computer and you know frame by
[1:27:10] frame analyze it and we had we were
[1:27:12] laughing we were laughing pretty much
[1:27:15] 80% of the stuff they were doing is just
[1:27:17] fake is just doing in a pool anyway
[1:27:20] that's not the topic but it's just a
[1:27:21] bunch of nonsense now if you don't
[1:27:23] believe me the prophets saying here the
[1:27:26] next slide see science they can trying
[1:27:29] to go to the moon and that's another
[1:27:31] Tower of Babel so they all these
[1:27:34] different things dispute Knicks in the
[1:27:36] race to get up there in the moon and so
[1:27:40] the Prophet I saw the spirit behind that
[1:27:42] and even steven epp concet you know the
[1:27:45] hurt is so fragile we need to escape
[1:27:47] so basically they're looking for a
[1:27:50] millennium in this space they want to
[1:27:51] escape fragile earth and we want to
[1:27:55] escape fragile earth as well but there's
[1:27:57] this only one way to get out of there
[1:27:59] hallelujah we'll go beyond the state the
[1:28:07] space station if it exists alright next
[1:28:12] quote
[1:28:14] and we believe that we're living in that
[1:28:17] type of they now when sputnik's are in
[1:28:19] disguise and the modern tower and of
[1:28:21] Tower of Babel is being in making they
[1:28:24] fly to the moon so the Prophet
[1:28:25] identified a spirit of Babylon behind a
[1:28:28] space program and that's exactly what it
[1:28:31] is mo so as astronaut or astronauts are
[1:28:35] freemasons and so there's a lot of
[1:28:37] witchcraft behind that if America would
[1:28:41] rally around Jesus Christ you would
[1:28:43] never have to worry about Russia coming
[1:28:45] in or nothing else coming in they would
[1:28:46] have to expend all expend all of our
[1:28:48] money and times making I draw hydrogen
[1:28:50] bonds and trying to fly over the moon
[1:28:52] with another Tower of Babel I like what
[1:28:54] he says to fly around the moon with the
[1:28:56] Tower of Babel like you understand what
[1:29:00] he means
[1:29:01] Alleluia that's that's the simple way to
[1:29:03] put it you fly around the moon with a
[1:29:05] Tower of Babel
[1:29:06] I want to see that fly but that's that's
[1:29:09] what he calls it that rocket he calls it
[1:29:11] a Tower of Babel it's a lie did they
[1:29:13] ever succeed in Genesis 11 did they
[1:29:16] succeed they never succeed they will not
[1:29:19] this time
[1:29:20] it can't babylon cannot succeed amen
[1:29:22] let's move on just showing you quickly
[1:29:25] all these movies making you friends with
[1:29:28] all that with them and so when we
[1:29:31] transformer Terminator Robocop
[1:29:34] short-circuit wall-e
[1:29:35] in gold Iraq and all these his movies
[1:29:38] making you friends with robot amen
[1:29:41] now many believes in the compatibility
[1:29:44] between human minds and computer
[1:29:46] hardware with the theoretical
[1:29:49] implication that human consciousness
[1:29:51] would one day be transferred to an
[1:29:54] alternative media a speculative
[1:29:56] technique commonly known as download of
[1:29:58] the mind basically your mind would be
[1:30:00] like a computer program you could basic
[1:30:02] able to download your mind on your hard
[1:30:05] drive put it simple
[1:30:07] okay so you think that's far stretch
[1:30:09] wait you just don't know what's going on
[1:30:12] how many have heard about the term
[1:30:15] Android before you've heard about
[1:30:19] Android yeah okay you've heard about it
[1:30:21] all right
[1:30:22] what's an Android
[1:30:24] you know what it's an Android it is
[1:30:27] it's a robot in a form of a human being
[1:30:31] there's that way that's why they called
[1:30:33] their phone this way
[1:30:36] they call it Android because it's a
[1:30:39] robot in a form of a union beam and so
[1:30:44] it's been for years they're planting
[1:30:46] seeds but b-but but they're moving their
[1:30:48] palm but we went on the word they're
[1:30:49] going so we don't realize but now when
[1:30:53] we bring all this together suddenly we
[1:30:55] realize oh my goodness this is all part
[1:30:57] of a big plan of course this is not
[1:31:00] Google Android's smashing or bashing
[1:31:04] because either Microsoft Apple it's all
[1:31:07] the same game let's move on quickly
[1:31:11] I got a skip a lot so I did talk about
[1:31:14] the Google glasses now so I can skip
[1:31:19] that if you've never seen that this is
[1:31:21] this is what we call wearable technology
[1:31:23] but it doesn't stop there they want to
[1:31:25] bring it much more uh the next step is
[1:31:28] implant and that's not far stretch
[1:31:31] that's just out our door now in the book
[1:31:34] of Psalm 139 verse 13
[1:31:40] it says for thou has four sets my rains
[1:31:43] Dallas cover me covered me in my
[1:31:46] mother's womb I will praise thee for I
[1:31:49] am fearfully and wonderfully made
[1:31:53] marvelous are thy works and that my soul
[1:31:56] knoweth right well as we have more and
[1:32:03] more technology we feel more dumb every
[1:32:08] day we have a smart phone a smart
[1:32:12] computer a smart car as smart microwave
[1:32:14] a smart oven everything becomes small
[1:32:17] around us and we feel dumb it's true
[1:32:24] even if you're good at it
[1:32:28] you feel done because he's so smart in
[1:32:31] you and if you can't use it you feel
[1:32:34] even more dumb but the Bible says that
[1:32:41] you are fearfully and wonderfully made
[1:32:45] this is what God says about you amen my
[1:32:55] substance was not hid from me when I was
[1:32:58] made in secret and curiously wrought in
[1:33:00] the lowest parts of the earth Dyan eyes
[1:33:02] did see me my see my substance yet being
[1:33:05] unperfect in thy book all my members
[1:33:07] were written which is continuous were
[1:33:09] fashion with us yet was none of them how
[1:33:12] precious are also thy thoughts unto me O
[1:33:16] God how great is this some of them
[1:33:20] hallelujah praise the Lord so this is
[1:33:24] what God is saying about us he's not
[1:33:27] saying challenge your biology called
[1:33:29] limitation with devices that's not what
[1:33:32] he's telling about it he says the way I
[1:33:34] made you my first thought of you was the
[1:33:37] right thought and of course we're also
[1:33:42] looking for a body change we know we are
[1:33:45] weak we know we are limited we know
[1:33:47] we're not even the shadow of what Adam
[1:33:49] was Aemon you think about Adam
[1:33:54] compatibility know everything he could
[1:33:56] do we're not even the shadow of what he
[1:33:58] was the first human being created but
[1:34:00] we're not looking for all that
[1:34:02] artificial even though we're using it
[1:34:04] but the Bride of Christ is not looking
[1:34:06] for an implants in the body the Bride of
[1:34:08] Christ is looking for a body change so
[1:34:14] transhumanism is preaching body change
[1:34:17] to go to space but the message of the
[1:34:20] hour is preaching body change to go in
[1:34:22] the rapture
[1:34:24] hallelujah amen
[1:34:29] is that close so close but so far
[1:34:34] amen hallelujah
[1:34:38] let's move on don't be excited yet I
[1:34:40] will
[1:34:42] you'll get another down I got you down
[1:34:46] for a couple of minutes now I got you up
[1:34:47] now let's go down again how many knows
[1:34:51] what this is oh my knees use it raise
[1:34:53] your hand then okay how many who's never
[1:34:55] used that never raise your hand really
[1:34:58] high somebody never used this though
[1:35:02] nobody's going to rapture my son Church
[1:35:04] I go we have few hands I mean there's
[1:35:06] hope it's a hopeless Church they all use
[1:35:09] that okay it's a joke now have you ever
[1:35:17] wondered what's behind that window we
[1:35:23] never thought about that right we're
[1:35:25] just asking questions
[1:35:27] when you go through this page what are
[1:35:29] you doing we call it a query the query
[1:35:32] is a question you're seeking something
[1:35:36] you want an answer
[1:35:38] where do you go Google
[1:35:45] a man and then
[1:35:51] we get a quick response you know when
[1:35:53] they start I don't know I don't think
[1:35:54] they do that anymore when it started the
[1:35:56] Google page they would tell you how many
[1:35:58] millions of answer you got in how many
[1:36:00] in a split second so they would tell you
[1:36:03] in a split second you got 22 million
[1:36:06] answers bragging how fast he would
[1:36:11] answer you pretty much competing with
[1:36:14] another high intelligence who's not as
[1:36:18] fast he could be as fast but he said to
[1:36:22] us in his word
[1:36:23] they'd wait upon the Lord now Google is
[1:36:30] using the other way and that's why they
[1:36:33] were bragging when they started
[1:36:35] it's like point zero zero zero five mili
[1:36:38] second 22 million answer now if you ever
[1:36:42] wonder well the answer is and we've been
[1:36:45] using Google for quite a while the
[1:36:47] answer behind
[1:36:51] Google page is what we call AI
[1:36:53] artificial intelligence
[1:36:57] now AI
[1:37:02] usually when they talk about it they
[1:37:04] always say all the the algorithm the
[1:37:07] algorithm which is pretty much Matt's
[1:37:10] mathematic equation of course it is our
[1:37:14] brain will count it's like a processor
[1:37:17] now so basically when you ask in
[1:37:20] question here
[1:37:22] there's an intelligence behind to make
[1:37:26] it simple from now until the end of the
[1:37:28] service I will call it AI
[1:37:32] now as we realize we rely more and more
[1:37:35] on AI
[1:37:37] because now when we drive you want to
[1:37:41] fastest road where do you do
[1:37:44] you google map who's running Google map
[1:37:47] ai ai uh scan all the streets speed
[1:37:52] lights traffic
[1:37:56] that brother brought me to the airport
[1:37:58] this morning and he's still using his
[1:38:00] old Garmin and I'm with my my my phone
[1:38:04] and like brother don't take this bridge
[1:38:08] Google's telling me that you go Google
[1:38:13] selling me there's a traffic jam on the
[1:38:15] bridge your old Garnon doesn't know it
[1:38:18] your Garmin telling you the fast road in
[1:38:21] better condition but it doesn't know
[1:38:23] when the worse happens
[1:38:24] now we laugh but basically Google knows
[1:38:27] this artist Ai knows the end of the road
[1:38:30] when you don't know this is how powerful
[1:38:34] it is it tells you there's an accident
[1:38:37] there don't go there does it sound like
[1:38:39] you like God would for tell you
[1:38:41] something
[1:38:41] don't take this road today there'll be a
[1:38:44] crash take this room but God would show
[1:38:46] you a vision so the AI knows the future
[1:38:51] now there's another app i was using
[1:38:53] google map a whole lot apple map doesn't
[1:38:55] work it's it's really bad so i was using
[1:38:58] google map and my son comes here today
[1:39:00] and he is using Waze and I started using
[1:39:03] Waze now ways is amazing because ways
[1:39:05] you can tell I want to be at the airport
[1:39:07] tomorrow at 8:00 then you're gonna tell
[1:39:09] you base based on all the traffic of the
[1:39:12] day before if you want to get there the
[1:39:14] airport at 8:00 on the on the on a
[1:39:16] Tuesday morning today was a Thursday
[1:39:18] morning you want to be the airport at
[1:39:20] 8:00
[1:39:20] you leave two hours before according to
[1:39:22] the traffic pattern of that day that
[1:39:25] time that time of year I was like wow
[1:39:30] every time we're like this we are amazed
[1:39:36] what we could see we could sing to AI
[1:39:39] I'm amazed you amaze me again you
[1:39:46] brought this new device on me of course
[1:39:51] we sing in church but we never get
[1:39:52] excited as much as when we are truly
[1:39:55] amazed I guess I just saved 30 minutes
[1:39:59] on this on the road today I'm amazed
[1:40:06] we're laughing huh
[1:40:08] and I want to show you that
[1:40:11] subconsciously someone is competing to
[1:40:16] be a provider someone is competing to
[1:40:20] bring the answer someone is competing
[1:40:22] that when you cry the answer he knows my
[1:40:29] name he hears me when I cry
[1:40:36] my subtitle tonight is calling upon the
[1:40:38] name of the Lord
[1:40:45] am I still using it yeah but when I did
[1:40:48] that study I realized Oh
[1:40:51] that can't rent turns into something
[1:40:53] spiritual where I relied more and more
[1:40:57] on science and less and less on God and
[1:41:00] that's exactly the idea of Kane when
[1:41:03] Kane in Genesis 4 left the presence of
[1:41:06] God he built a city and why for to
[1:41:09] supply all his need because in a city
[1:41:11] you got the guy who works metal you got
[1:41:14] a guy who sells milk you got a and a
[1:41:16] city is built to supply you left God God
[1:41:20] was no more his provider and the seed
[1:41:23] idea of a city and the Prophet says is
[1:41:26] the beginning of civilization
[1:41:29] now we're on the climax of it it nothing
[1:41:33] has ever been as it was as it is right
[1:41:36] now and all I'm talking about is devices
[1:41:39] and stuff that's happening in the last
[1:41:41] year's just a couple of years and it's
[1:41:43] moving fast and our Abbot's is changing
[1:41:47] quickly
[1:41:49] I don't know what store you have it
[1:41:51] maybe uh yeah Walmart would be maybe
[1:41:54] something similar back home we have what
[1:41:56] we call Kenny's entire Kenna's entire is
[1:41:58] like a Walmart but more with a lot more
[1:42:01] car parts and stuff I don't even go
[1:42:03] there anymore for car parts because it's
[1:42:04] too expensive and soaked behavior change
[1:42:07] we don't supply our needs we don't look
[1:42:10] for the answers at the same place we
[1:42:13] don't wait anymore now we we have a
[1:42:17] query and if it spins too long it used
[1:42:24] to be you take the phone you dial the
[1:42:33] young people you don't know that it was
[1:42:35] a it was a dial phone you have to put
[1:42:37] your finger there's a video I met a
[1:42:39] father took a phone like this and gave
[1:42:41] it to his young boy who says how do we
[1:42:43] use that they had no clue how to make a
[1:42:45] phone call with a dial that's a funny
[1:42:49] one so it's basically becoming a
[1:42:52] fellowship where we're walking and in
[1:42:57] him
[1:42:58] now that the Prophet foreseen AI
[1:43:03] I think he did he didn't call it
[1:43:06] artificial intelligence but he gave it a
[1:43:08] name as you know a prophet in the Bible
[1:43:09] would gave name to something that was
[1:43:12] not invented yet like Israel will come
[1:43:14] back on the wing of an eagle well it was
[1:43:15] not an eagle but he was a plane right
[1:43:18] and so a prophet would give because the
[1:43:21] word is not invented yet but he saw a
[1:43:24] season and so he gives he put words on
[1:43:26] what he sees for us to understand and he
[1:43:30] says here and I said then sign is going
[1:43:32] to be so great men is going to get so
[1:43:34] smart till he will invent so many things
[1:43:36] until it's going to make a nut
[1:43:38] automobile that looks like an egg that I
[1:43:41] have like a glass on top of it and he'll
[1:43:43] be controlled by some other power than a
[1:43:47] steering wheel and they've got to car
[1:43:50] that other power that's driving the car
[1:43:53] is a I saw I saw it eating you and I was
[1:43:58] not human intelligence driving the car
[1:44:00] it was some other power driving it now
[1:44:02] we know these are called smart car drive
[1:44:05] by artificial intelligence the Prophet
[1:44:09] SAW now he a focused a lot on the car
[1:44:13] and we did as well because he said car
[1:44:15] we thinking car and as we waited for the
[1:44:18] car we've been bombarded by smart phone
[1:44:21] smart computer smart they smart that
[1:44:23] well we're waiting for the egg-shaped
[1:44:24] car and and it's all we're looking but
[1:44:27] that's not what he said he said science
[1:44:30] to be so great
[1:44:31] he will invent so many things it's not
[1:44:35] just about the car the car is the way to
[1:44:38] summarize the generation the generation
[1:44:42] will condition of the age the car is the
[1:44:46] sign of a big condition you're with me
[1:44:53] so now it's it's not a phone it's a
[1:44:55] smartphone not a car it's a smart car
[1:44:59] it's not a battery now it's a smart
[1:45:01] battery everything is smart because now
[1:45:04] it's not it doesn't just fulfill what
[1:45:06] it's supposed to do basically it now
[1:45:09] analyzes a smart battery will detect
[1:45:12] your battery how much it can take and it
[1:45:15] will adjust itself if you don't have a
[1:45:17] smart battery and you plug it you can
[1:45:19] burn it because he will just blow your
[1:45:21] your battery but a smart battery will
[1:45:24] detect will analyze it's smart it thinks
[1:45:29] so we are and this is just a start but
[1:45:33] now every aspect of our life we used to
[1:45:37] have a piano an organ but now the
[1:45:40] keyboard is a smart piano
[1:45:43] so think about every devices everything
[1:45:46] becomes smart
[1:45:48] it's science
[1:45:51] let's meet move move move move come on
[1:45:53] brother Steve people have to get up
[1:45:55] Friday morning amen
[1:46:02] let us define an ultra-intelligent
[1:46:05] machine as a machine that can surpass by
[1:46:08] far all delay intellectual activities of
[1:46:10] every man even intelligent ones machine
[1:46:14] machine design being one of these
[1:46:16] intellectual activities an
[1:46:18] ultra-intelligent machine could be
[1:46:20] design could design even better machines
[1:46:23] then there would be then an indisputable
[1:46:27] explosion of intelligence and the
[1:46:29] intelligence of the men would be left
[1:46:31] far behind
[1:46:32] so the first ultra intelligent machine
[1:46:36] is the latest invention that men needs
[1:46:38] to realize 1965 basically saying that
[1:46:43] what they need to invent is a smart
[1:46:45] computer that will take over and then
[1:46:49] that
[1:46:51] artificial intelligence will invent the
[1:46:53] rest because it will surpass human
[1:46:56] intelligence to such a level now we
[1:46:59] don't realize I got to skip some of the
[1:47:02] thing but I just want you to see that
[1:47:04] this is not just a new idea this is 1965
[1:47:08] this is this has been there Satan has
[1:47:10] been wanting to push this push that for
[1:47:13] so long
[1:47:16] you wake up one morning to find that
[1:47:19] your brain has another functional lobe
[1:47:21] invincible this auxilary lobe answers
[1:47:24] your questions when information beyond
[1:47:26] the scope of your own memory suggests
[1:47:29] plausible lines of action and ask
[1:47:31] questions to eye light relevant facts
[1:47:34] you quickly find yourself on the new
[1:47:36] lobe to the point of stopping to wonder
[1:47:38] how it works you just used it this is
[1:47:41] the dream of artificial intelligence
[1:47:43] April 1985 we're there right now he is
[1:47:50] do you have to go to the computer then
[1:47:52] you start asking questions to your phone
[1:47:54] and now your phone is in your pocket
[1:47:55] you're asking question to your watch
[1:47:59] right what's the next step he was the
[1:48:02] glasses and what's the next step implant
[1:48:04] you think that's a far stretch already
[1:48:06] right now people are getting implants
[1:48:11] they're having articles on there
[1:48:14] the latest article I just shown to the
[1:48:16] people of my church because I preached a
[1:48:17] series back home and then a couple of
[1:48:19] weeks ago they had an article on the
[1:48:21] topic and and the guy was talking about
[1:48:23] it he was waving his said satanic symbol
[1:48:25] they're shown to the church and to the
[1:48:27] people at the church this look he's
[1:48:29] talking about implants and look at the
[1:48:31] sign he's waving in an occult sign
[1:48:34] there's just to show you that this is a
[1:48:36] satanic agenda
[1:48:40] after several decades with the rapid
[1:48:42] advancement of communication technology
[1:48:44] everyone will have a brainwave receiver
[1:48:46] in their ear which directly and
[1:48:49] accurately conveys what other tinks on
[1:48:51] themself and vice versa that's a mother
[1:48:54] in facebook what everybody thinks of
[1:48:56] themselves of the other what I think
[1:48:59] will be known to everyone there is no
[1:49:00] longer an individual consciousness only
[1:49:02] the will of humanity as a whole
[1:49:05] 1960 this is a global idea so you often
[1:49:09] time you have pictures like this to talk
[1:49:12] about the AI so that's pretty much the
[1:49:14] brain behind all this now what we don't
[1:49:17] realize is that every aspect of society
[1:49:20] now will be or is controlled by AI
[1:49:24] that we don't realize now what they call
[1:49:27] what they want now even Montreal they
[1:49:28] want to become a smart city you've heard
[1:49:31] about the term smart city all the lights
[1:49:33] are synchronize you stop at a light it
[1:49:36] analyzed okay there's more car here turn
[1:49:38] red turn green have you ever wondered
[1:49:40] why you have to stop at midnight on red
[1:49:42] light when there's no cars and what do
[1:49:45] we say is that stupid they're gonna make
[1:49:49] it smart and so it's all and so what we
[1:49:54] don't realize that every aspect of
[1:49:57] society
[1:49:58] iwase Road building thermostat
[1:50:03] everything is linked to a brain that
[1:50:07] control every aspect of society now I
[1:50:10] could do another sermon about
[1:50:12] controlling people
[1:50:15] because that people are so happy that
[1:50:17] that monster will turn against the
[1:50:21] people and it will become the prison
[1:50:26] because now you know the Prophet says
[1:50:28] you don't want to be a foolish virgin in
[1:50:30] the day as a tribulation because he says
[1:50:32] they will be hunted like dogs try to
[1:50:36] hide as a Christian in the days of
[1:50:39] tribulation where you can't buy you
[1:50:42] can't sell you can't have a taxi ride
[1:50:45] with loose change because you need a
[1:50:47] credit card you need a ubirr account
[1:50:49] there's nowhere to go nowhere to stay
[1:50:52] everything isn't everything there's a
[1:50:54] trace to everything this is where it's
[1:50:58] the grid it's right now it's upon us of
[1:51:01] course us we'll be out of here so that's
[1:51:04] why this pearl I've privacy thing and
[1:51:07] all this conspiracy which is not
[1:51:09] conspiracy it's reality why did NSA why
[1:51:12] did CIA funded all that why did why did
[1:51:15] the CIA funded Amazon and Jeff Bezos
[1:51:19] millions of dollar to develop their AI
[1:51:23] so the CIA is working with Amazon real
[1:51:26] news not conspiracy theory real
[1:51:28] financial news the CIA is working with
[1:51:31] Amazon why it's it's a one day this
[1:51:34] gonna turn against humanity we have what
[1:51:36] we call fast
[1:51:37] we got no now we have smart homes get in
[1:51:41] the house open the oven raise the
[1:51:44] temperature and all these devices all
[1:51:46] connected you got that that's already
[1:51:48] exist
[1:51:50] there's a funny video where the guy
[1:51:51] comes back from the dentist and his
[1:51:53] voice recognition he wants to enter in
[1:51:55] his home but I was I was mouth he comes
[1:51:58] back from the next okay open the door
[1:52:01] oh brother lord I don't recognize that
[1:52:04] real quick open the door and now he's
[1:52:09] freezing in his home regular temperature
[1:52:11] and now you raised the music it's cold
[1:52:14] river temperature raise the volume raise
[1:52:17] repose which will raise the volume and
[1:52:20] so yeah we talked about advancing now
[1:52:26] they bring another stage where than I
[1:52:28] don't think we have these devices in the
[1:52:31] home which is waiting and listening it
[1:52:35] knows your voice I did a demo back home
[1:52:37] at my church my phone was on my desk it
[1:52:40] on the pulpit and I activated the voice
[1:52:43] thing because I hate it it's not
[1:52:44] activated but for the meeting I've
[1:52:46] activated and I was far from the Pope in
[1:52:49] us there's a Siri what about the
[1:52:51] temperature tomorrow temperature
[1:52:52] tomorrow will be probably and I put the
[1:52:54] mic I said to the guy at the sound booth
[1:52:56] I said said when I talked to my phone
[1:52:58] you and so the microphone was on my
[1:53:00] phone that we have a pulpit microphone
[1:53:03] it was on my phone and I was talking and
[1:53:05] so the voice started a ringing the
[1:53:07] speaker and I had a church saw me
[1:53:09] talking with my phone and it recognized
[1:53:11] my voice and I said you could try to
[1:53:12] talk to my phone II would never listen
[1:53:14] to you because it knows my voice because
[1:53:17] it does a voice sampling and it would
[1:53:19] not listen to any voice come in outside
[1:53:21] of my own so he knows my name
[1:53:25] he knows my voice he hears me when I cry
[1:53:30] is is so close voice recognition and I'm
[1:53:35] asking question he's answering me and
[1:53:37] I'm calling now I'm getting I'm closing
[1:53:39] I'm getting to this does this thing
[1:53:42] calling upon
[1:53:46] when we because now it's all
[1:53:48] voice-activated you got the Google thing
[1:53:50] and you know what they're selling there
[1:53:52] they're almost giving it to you now it
[1:53:54] used to sell a big prize now you got
[1:53:55] Costco 40 bucks there they almost
[1:53:58] they're gonna give it to you because
[1:53:59] they want you to have it on your table
[1:54:00] sitting there of course because its
[1:54:03] first of all it's listening all the time
[1:54:04] so it's a major spying tool but not only
[1:54:08] that it's just that it's it's that smart
[1:54:10] environment where you rely on artificial
[1:54:13] intelligence you're cooking how many
[1:54:14] eggs should I put in this pancake you
[1:54:16] should put this many eggs in your paper
[1:54:18] well thank you ah should that cake of
[1:54:22] 450 or 300 a according to this website
[1:54:26] you should put your oven at 400 degrees
[1:54:27] all Thank You Siri for this what did I
[1:54:31] put on my grocery list last week last
[1:54:33] week you put this on your groceries ooh
[1:54:36] okay mind me to put this and you're
[1:54:38] talking you're having fellowship with a
[1:54:41] machine in your kitchen
[1:54:47] that's not tomorrow that's now that's
[1:54:49] that's now now I talked about Elon Musk
[1:54:55] Tesla SpaceX well he's not just in that
[1:54:59] but he's also he has a company named
[1:55:02] neuro-link
[1:55:03] AI for your brain Elon Musk I'm about to
[1:55:06] announce the new ruling product that
[1:55:08] connects your brain to computers so Elon
[1:55:12] Musk once the space travel design
[1:55:16] electric car of course to save the
[1:55:18] planet because there's a make any
[1:55:19] pollution co2 is a big big pollution
[1:55:24] it's a joke no I won't get started on
[1:55:29] co2 because that's a joke anyway so he's
[1:55:33] making cars that drive by itself flies
[1:55:36] to the moon and wants to connect our
[1:55:38] brain to a computer
[1:55:40] that's transhumanism that's exactly what
[1:55:44] this name was pushing Elon Musk Steve
[1:55:47] job all these guys Silicon Valley
[1:55:49] Hollywood Satan seed bagging on you were
[1:55:53] running it
[1:55:56] now you know and in closing you know
[1:56:00] what got my attention
[1:56:01] what really stroked me who strike me
[1:56:05] past tense present tense always confused
[1:56:08] I was listening when when Apple released
[1:56:13] a new product product they invite all
[1:56:15] the people to the Church of Apple in
[1:56:17] California and they all gather together
[1:56:19] and worship all get excited and you got
[1:56:28] to know me I'm sarcastic sometime okay
[1:56:32] any sin he said a word here in he's
[1:56:36] talking about series now Siri is that
[1:56:38] the AI of Apple now every company Google
[1:56:41] has is is a Google Amazon as is its Alex
[1:56:45] so every big corporation in Silicon
[1:56:48] Valley has their own AI I think one day
[1:56:52] they're gonna merge together and it's
[1:56:53] going to be a one big god but for now
[1:56:56] they have all they're all little gods
[1:56:57] and he's talking about how to use Siri
[1:57:02] how much he improving this and then he
[1:57:04] said when you want to invoke Syrian
[1:57:05] either this invoke Syria now the word
[1:57:08] invoke in English is not really it
[1:57:11] doesn't have like you're just religious
[1:57:12] twist to it but in French
[1:57:15] in French if you want to say the French
[1:57:18] Bible says calling upon the name of the
[1:57:20] Lord is invoke a Voki lasagna are you
[1:57:23] French your fonts it a vocalist again so
[1:57:28] invoke is call upon
[1:57:31] so I'm a French and I hear him invoke
[1:57:35] Siri and he raises Helen when you want
[1:57:37] to invoke Siri his sharp is like boom
[1:57:40] like what and it's the first time I got
[1:57:44] that the religious taste of that ol
[1:57:48] thing I never saw it before
[1:57:50] I never saw it about you know you ask
[1:57:51] questions serious like no Siri remind me
[1:57:55] tomorrow Siri what's the temperature
[1:57:57] tomorrow you know you're just asking
[1:57:59] question but when he said in folk then I
[1:58:00] realized why does he him what he says
[1:58:02] use that time and raise his head like
[1:58:05] that and then I realized
[1:58:07] there's more to this that's where it
[1:58:10] leant it leads me to the my step to the
[1:58:12] study I'm doing it and it's basically
[1:58:14] how to invoke Siri on iPad Pro now Siri
[1:58:17] now to make it quick but in in
[1:58:20] witchcraft everything is reversed the
[1:58:22] black is white the white is black rock
[1:58:24] and roll music you play in Reverse you
[1:58:26] hear a lot of time you'll hear
[1:58:28] demonic voice so in witchcraft a lot of
[1:58:30] thing is reversed so if you reverse Siri
[1:58:32] it's iris and iris is the god is the
[1:58:36] Greek god of communication so it's a
[1:58:39] demon
[1:58:41] so serious Siri reverses iris is a God
[1:58:45] that you invoke so it's not just
[1:58:48] technology and it's not I still use it
[1:58:53] but we want to be able to identify the
[1:58:57] evil behind it as they move their pawns
[1:59:00] okay this is where they're going and we
[1:59:03] want to use that as a warning we don't
[1:59:06] want to be ignorant of Satan's devices
[1:59:08] expert says humans would one day love
[1:59:11] our artificial intelligence AI as it
[1:59:14] were as a god because the technology
[1:59:16] will be much better than us while former
[1:59:18] ubirr and Google engineer Antony Levin
[1:59:21] dusky creates a new religion based on
[1:59:23] artificial intelligence experts say
[1:59:25] religion will not fail as people tend to
[1:59:27] venerate understanding supreme or
[1:59:29] supreme understanding so there's an
[1:59:32] article here the rise of the machines
[1:59:34] AI will be worship like your God one
[1:59:37] warned experts so this engineer from
[1:59:40] uber and from Google because of course
[1:59:42] they they all you know go from companies
[1:59:45] to companies II and and so he started a
[1:59:47] church and it's called the AI Church
[1:59:50] it's called a God but religion the new
[1:59:53] Church of the AI God is even creepier
[1:59:55] than I imagined so and we even have
[1:59:59] pictures like this you know where the
[2:00:02] Michelangelo pictures where God gives
[2:00:04] life to Adam but now it's it's AI gives
[2:00:07] life to human being and so it's it's the
[2:00:10] spirit behind it there's a religious
[2:00:13] things behind it
[2:00:16] now I close for real
[2:00:21] in the same chapter that I've read about
[2:00:26] King
[2:00:28] Kaine call upon is technolog technology
[2:00:32] on verse 26 and to Seth to him also
[2:00:36] there was born a son and he called his
[2:00:38] name eNOS and then became then began men
[2:00:42] to call upon the name of the Lord he got
[2:00:48] the son of the serpent
[2:00:50] and you got the Son of God and he calls
[2:00:55] in the same chapter one is cast away
[2:00:59] from the presence of the Lord and relies
[2:01:02] on his technology and the other one is a
[2:01:05] simple shepherd and he calls upon the
[2:01:09] name of the Lord he invokes the Lord let
[2:01:14] me finish with this
[2:01:17] a couple of scriptures Psalm 116 I will
[2:01:21] take the cup of salvation and call upon
[2:01:24] the name of the Lord I will offer unto
[2:01:28] thee to sacrifice of Thanksgiving and
[2:01:31] will call upon the name of the Lord have
[2:01:35] we've not maybe sometimes fall in the
[2:01:38] trap to so quickly call upon technology
[2:01:42] ask question to Google we're not
[2:01:46] thinking about God and you think okay
[2:01:50] asking question about how to fix that
[2:01:51] lawnmower is one thing but have you ever
[2:01:55] watched a survey Google will put out a
[2:01:57] survey sometime of the type of question
[2:01:59] people ask to Google people are asked
[2:02:02] life-changing decision should we have a
[2:02:06] third child and then Google will give
[2:02:10] you this statistic and say you know our
[2:02:14] sibling and it and it will answer to
[2:02:16] your question will bring up studies and
[2:02:18] people will rely on a I should I go take
[2:02:22] this job in that city well this city is
[2:02:24] well known for this well known for that
[2:02:26] the AI does just not answer you about
[2:02:29] fixing a lot more or or how to reboot
[2:02:31] your computer or how to change a part in
[2:02:34] your car people are relying on AI for
[2:02:39] life-changing decision because they
[2:02:42] don't they don't have anyone to guide
[2:02:45] them they don't have anyone to call upon
[2:02:50] it used to be a non-christian would ask
[2:02:53] his father and ask his brother his
[2:02:55] brother-in-law his boss his co-worker
[2:02:58] but now people know that Google is way
[2:03:00] smarter than your coworker Google knows
[2:03:03] much more than my own father but what
[2:03:08] about us Christians do we rely on a
[2:03:11] supreme intelligence
[2:03:14] are you there do we rely on the supreme
[2:03:17] intelligence that knows us before the
[2:03:20] foundation of the world that we were in
[2:03:23] his thoughts before the foundation of
[2:03:25] the world and we will be with him with
[2:03:27] all eternity and he knows the DN before
[2:03:30] even when it starts of course there's
[2:03:36] little simple things that we rely upon
[2:03:38] you know what's the best road to take
[2:03:41] and we use it but let's not be consumed
[2:03:44] by it
[2:03:44] let's not excessively you use it as it
[2:03:48] wants to invade our life and be sitting
[2:03:50] on our table all day and asking
[2:03:52] answering every kind of questions that
[2:03:55] we have and and we talk more to the
[2:03:58] phone and we spend time in prayers it's
[2:04:05] not true it's not a blaming game tonight
[2:04:07] it's to expose the evil in this world
[2:04:10] Jesus says I will not take you out of
[2:04:13] this world but I want to keep you from
[2:04:15] the evil and there's an evil one into
[2:04:18] all these devices there's a religious
[2:04:20] spirit demonic religious spirit that
[2:04:23] wants to replace God that's been
[2:04:25] Lucifer's dream all along and the
[2:04:33] Prophet has warned us that he's invading
[2:04:35] true California he's invading it's a
[2:04:38] satanic demonic invasion and he said in
[2:04:41] every homes and we were thinking
[2:04:43] television but now what's a TV obviously
[2:04:47] what's a TV
[2:04:50] TV now is better than Internet there's
[2:04:54] more trash on internet that you can
[2:04:56] watch on a TV there's much more filth on
[2:05:00] internet that you can you can you can go
[2:05:03] in a hotel room and skip all the channel
[2:05:05] if you don't pay for those movie those
[2:05:07] bad one but if you just switch channel
[2:05:09] you'll never get as much filth that
[2:05:13] internet but we don't have a TV but we
[2:05:17] have internet right I have internet and
[2:05:21] it's been a truck for me it's been a
[2:05:23] trap for I'm doing youth camp I'm doing
[2:05:26] brothers meeting it's a trap for
[2:05:28] Christians but it brings good it brings
[2:05:33] good but it brings such a load of bad
[2:05:35] but Jesus wants to keep us from the evil
[2:05:39] he wants us to call upon his name but
[2:05:42] how much these devices slowly and some
[2:05:45] time really fast they replace our time
[2:05:47] of consecration they replaced a family
[2:05:50] altar and and we reboot we start we
[2:05:53] reestablish family altar we push these
[2:05:56] things aside three months later we were
[2:05:58] fall back in the same trap we have to
[2:06:00] reboot again we it's a constant fight
[2:06:02] and we have to be aware of what we're
[2:06:05] fighting against
[2:06:08] hello closing Romans 10 is one of my
[2:06:13] favorite for whosoever shall call upon
[2:06:16] the name of the Lord shall be saved
[2:06:23] the musicians can come now shall be
[2:06:27] saved we understand it are the great
[2:06:29] salvation Redemption that let's bring
[2:06:31] let's agree tonight on the compound
[2:06:33] meaning he can save us from any
[2:06:36] situation as Google can save us
[2:06:39] sometimes from calling you up on an
[2:06:41] expensive repair guy and save us from
[2:06:44] the little bitty things that we're going
[2:06:46] to search and find a solution but the
[2:06:48] calling upon the name of the Lord can
[2:06:50] put us out of trouble
[2:06:52] you got financial problem call upon the
[2:06:55] name of the Lord because whosoever shall
[2:07:00] call upon the name of the Lord not may
[2:07:03] be but shall be safe and the Lord will
[2:07:09] not brag that he brought to you twenty
[2:07:11] two million answer in that split second
[2:07:14] but he'll brag you that I brought you
[2:07:17] one answer in a week in a day in one
[2:07:22] hour
[2:07:22] sometimes it's instant we have witness
[2:07:25] people I prayed and right away somebody
[2:07:27] knocked at my door others I prayed and I
[2:07:30] waited and I waited and I begged the
[2:07:32] Lord and a year later Lori answered we
[2:07:34] got Abraham you waited 25 years the Lord
[2:07:37] doesn't bride on a split second 22
[2:07:39] million answers he's got one answer and
[2:07:43] it's his perfect will and they not wait
[2:07:46] upon the Lord we'll get an answer why
[2:07:51] because in my distress I don't have it
[2:07:54] anymore to Samuel 22 in my distress I
[2:07:57] call upon the name of the Lord and cried
[2:08:00] to my god and neaten he did hear my
[2:08:03] voice out of his temple and my cry did
[2:08:07] enter into his ears
[2:08:12] and I could go even further saying that
[2:08:14] sometime you're calling upon and then
[2:08:16] there's no signal you're in a dead zone
[2:08:19] a dead zone we hate it but with Jesus
[2:08:26] there's nowhere you can go with have a
[2:08:28] dead zone you see on this highway big
[2:08:35] banner of the rise in greatest coverage
[2:08:37] sprint greatest cover everybody says
[2:08:39] they have the greatest coverage but
[2:08:41] nobody has even the shadow of the
[2:08:43] coverage of our Lord Jesus Christ every
[2:08:48] time you look in your soul you have five
[2:08:50] bars they want to implant five g's he
[2:08:55] has far better than that it's the fast
