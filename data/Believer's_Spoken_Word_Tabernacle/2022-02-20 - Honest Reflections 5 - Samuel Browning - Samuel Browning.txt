brother samuel again [Music] is [Music] is [Music] there's no one no one like our lord jesus amen we're just so thankful for his mercy once again this morning so so glad to be able to be gathered together god has made a way that we can be here this morning certainly wasn't expecting this as far as these thursdays we've had to cancel god's been very gracious to us over the past number of years i don't really remember some of the last times we had to cancel services so i'm just thankful to the lord thankful for his leadership and his guidance on everything in our lives but it's just good to be together and these are these are times that we we take and we value very deeply because in these times that we come together it's more than just seeing one another yet brother bram says when the love of god is in your heart he says you long to go where others are and fellowship because it's you're a part of the body it's a part of the body of jesus christ and that's something that you or i didn't do in ourselves that's a work of the holy spirit that brings us into that place you know just like if i spoke to an individual not too long ago i said if you just imagine in this way if you sat down to type anything out on the computer and your left hand said you know what uh i'm not gonna i don't feel like this today i don't feel like touching keys today and i'm just going to take take the day off you can't do that you can't do that it's there's times in our life that you know what when we come to the house of god let me just be honest sometimes it's easy are you hearing me sometimes it's easy then there's other times you've got to press and i'm not just talking about burnt toast burnt eggs electrics out i'm not talking about that i'm sometimes i'm talking about where you're pressing beyond even thoughts pressing beyond things that come your way and i want you to understand this we're living in an hour in an age when when the prophet of god would take and deal with the characteristics that are in the age around us you know those spirits are real the spirit of that pressure that the prophet identified of the ladies and age is a pressure of soft easy living that would seem contradictory a pressure to be soft easy living but think of it the pressure that comes to where to to come upon us to just cave in at certain things well this is required this is oh i just don't i don't know if i can or i don't know and listen let's just be honest the scriptures identify this the flesh is weak the spirit is willing the flesh is never going to be a cheerleader for us to the things of god the flesh is never going to be a cheerleader but the flesh is going to always be against us but the brahm uses countless stories and once again going into different things and we recognize we're here this morning it's been a battle and we're engaged in a battle right here this morning as the word will come forth there is an engagement in battle we've come to do battle this morning we've come amen to announce to satan once again you're defeated and to announce to him you showed up at the wrong meeting that's the kind of people were to be you showed up at the wrong time this is the wrong time god tarries tomorrow showed up at the wrong time amen amen and amen i just want to as we go to the throne of god in prayer once again there's a request that came in for my aunt linda and they they had to she went back into the icu and they put her [Music] with on that bipap you know she had the double lung transplant and there's just um she's doing very well her body has accepted the lungs but i'm going to say this to all of us as a church and i've said this over and over not just when it comes to my lender or anybody else but when we hear when you hear someone else who's sick in the congregation and you hear oh there's improvement what should i do put your foot on the gas a little bit more don't take it off just put the foot on the gas a little bit more because victory is right there in sight so we want to go before the throne of god and take take our sister linda in prayer because i tell you god has certainly kept his hand upon her and provided for her you know i like paul said this morning i miss seeing her set back there and just her hands in there and just worshiping and you know just just just weeping in the presence of god but we'll be gathered together here amen again we believe that god he is working and god is mindful god didn't bring her this far is that right i also want to remind you this morning as we as we go in prayer also the fellowship dinner following the service and we just want to just turn our hearts now into the things of almighty god we're gathered here for a purpose let's just now approach his throne once again can we just go together heavenly father lord we thank you for this moment that we have lord father we know that it's just but a moment that lord that we have when we come and we gather here lord and father we're so thankful god as i look around the congregation lord this morning to see lord a perseverance lord to see a pressing in their lord to know that god has hearts and lives lord have pressed even in this moment lord beyond feelings beyond doubts even beyond discouragements lord now father we're asking lord this morning that you will come lord it's not hard to ask these things because you promised it lord in your word but we would ask o god that you would come lord and do the exceedingly abundantly above all that we could think or even ask we ask that you will come lord and minister to every single need that's here in such a personal way oh god to where when we would walk out of this meeting here lord it's as though oh god you have walked personally with each and every one of us lord as you walked with the two down to the road of emmaus lord for we're not strangers lord we're not we're even lord greater than friends we are your brethren lord there's been a change in relationship and i pray this morning lord may there be a change in relationship oh god may the holy spirit lord just have such the right way in this service lord and as we're gathered here together lord we're mindful god of different needs lord among us lord where sickness lord has wanted to come lord we're reminded oh god of lord how our prophet has taught us lord that satan and his imps bring sickness and disease but we as the army of the living god are commissioned and charged to cast satan out so lord we stand together unified lord under the blood covenant of the lord jesus christ and lord we send the enforcer the holy spirit that god you would go forth lord into that hospital room lord you would move lord god i pray right now lord upon those levels lord in her body may there be an expelling of that seal too lord and may oh god the very virtue of the living god just strike in that body this morning lord let it be an atmosphere that is charged in that room lord of love of courage and ability o god granted lord we pray this morning lord may you lord just give such strength lord to our sister linda lord and for every other need and every other request lord we ask that god you and move into such a really personal way father minister to the needs of your children lord physical and spiritual healing this morning we pray we ask it lord in the name of jesus christ amen amen don't you love him amen let's turn in our bibles to haggai chapter one i'm just going to read verses one and two and then i'm gonna i'll ask you you can be seated then but verses verse one in the second year of darius the king and in the second month in the first day of the month came the word of the lord by haggai the prophet unto zerubbabel the son of shatil governor of judah and to joshua the son of joseph the high priest saying thus speaketh the lord of hosts saying this people say the time has not come the time that the lord's house should be built may god bless you bless the reading of the word i'd like to continue reading there if that'd be okay in verse 3 the bible says then came the word of the lord by haggai the prophet saying and i want you just to just to catch this very clearly this was not haggai simply quoting what jeremiah had said this was not simply haggai just quoting what isaiah had spoken the word of the lord is the inspiration of the holy spirit that takes what has already been said and declares this is now it takes the spirit of god to come and to bring the word present when he revealed himself to moses at the burning bush he revealed himself as the i am and god will always come and reveal himself as the i am that's that's what he wants to do that's how he comes to do it and that's what we must have in our lives we must have this is why even in in praying as we i've been looking at it on thursday nights give us this day our daily bread and we recognize that that that daily bread we're not talking about wonder bread and nickel bread or french bread or italian bread we're talking about the bread of life which is the staff of life which is the holy spirit which is the word of god made manifest give us this day our daily bread give lord what is needed in my life you know what i have need of lord give to me lord my daily bread yes and so when we look the word of the lord came by haggai the prophet saying now they had the writings but god remember god uses the agency of man now when we look at how that the word of the lord it comes to them and i want to just just go through these verses here just for a few moments notice it says in verse 4 is it time for you o ye to dwell in your sealed houses and this house lie waste now i want you to notice the word of the lord the discernment is coming by the word of the lord when the word comes it comes to ask questions not so much that we and ourselves would answer but the word comes with a question for us to reflect who do you say this is he wasn't asking instruct me that what the ministry is that's going on that's not what he was saying when the message was preached in this hour is this the sign of the answers it wasn't a question what do you all think it was god works by questions to cause us to reflect 1964 who do you say this is who is this who is this jesus these are questions that are asked to reflect and consider presently what's taking place so there must come a discernment of the word of the lord and it's got to come and god uses he uses that agency of man now notice in verse 5. now therefore thus saith the lord of hosts consider your ways now here he is this this is already this is not something that's secretive as far as like we're going to uncover things that's in your life but now he's what he's calling him to look at is look at the things that are taking place and i want you to look at him so to think the grace of god would be able to take the people into a place to where now the people can stand and actually begin to watch how their lives have been unfolding and be able to see right where they're at i tell you there's a lot of places we can receive invitation to that we would gladly and man the flesh would say i'll be there like hey samuel today we're going to have steak and lobster tail i'll be there what time you need me to be there let me pick anything up for you but then there's other things that we're invited to that the flesh is not always willing and this is something right here the flesh isn't willing the flesh isn't who isn't willing to come and now where weakness where fault is where things are at but notice the word the word is not contacting the flesh because if the word was contacting the flesh the people would say i don't need to hear this you understand man i i'm working like crazy i don't need to hear this right now but the word of the lord not a letter not a letter the spirit of god the word of the lord is coming and it's contacting the people of god who are the people of the promise it's making a connection and even in that moment to energize them to be able to step into that place if i can say it this way a prophetic realm remind you you and i where we are standing in this hour this this book of revelation the whole book the whole book it is to be revealed only to a special class of people brother branham would say it in this way in that same quote it'll take one with prophetic insight so there had to come a prophetic ministry as ordained by god but remember the prophetic ministry was only to declare where we are at to show us who is present and this is the way to enter in to full relationship is that right the prophet is the veil but you must go behind the veil right the veil is used to declare god is present it's an unveiling of god and it unveils unfolds to you and i that the god who always was is present and he's still the same with the same power same deliverance same healing same baptism of the holy ghost it declares he is here now is that right because in no other age look at every other message to every other church age behold i come quickly behold i come behold but in this last age he said i'm here i stand at the door and not i'm personal right there before your heart knocking at your hearts amen this message it's the coming of the lord it's bringing the coming of the lord down into earth and vessels to prepare for that physical coming is everybody okay thus saith the lord a host consider your ways you have sown much and you bring in little you eat but you have not enough you drink but you're not filled with drink you clothe but none is warm he that earneth wages earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes thus saith the lord of hosts consider your ways i'll say this the word of the lord it's discerned and now it's asking them to reflect consider your ways he's is asking see the word comes while even the word is coming forth even in this moment it's asking you and i will we agree with the word will we take sides with the word remember when brother branham preached that message taking sides with jesus he was making an announcement i'm taking sides with jesus and he lays a lot out in that message for even how that has churches what he sees that coming on he says as the early church started i believe that as that that original branch now comes forth that there will be churches ministry all of those ministerial offices then he breaks it down into the family in that service and he speaks of how he says we don't know how long he'll tarry but we may must make arrangements for our children that are coming on what is all of that that is done by taking sides with jesus so it always the word always comes to a place of agreement you see the word can never move any further in our life unless we agree with it not reason with it agree with it notice he goes on to say in verse 8 go up to the mountain and bring wood and build the house and i will take pleasure in it and i will be glorified saith the lord so he's letting him know this is my will this is where i'm pleased this is this is where my pleasure this is serving my will you see what he's letting him know in verse 8 this is where you let down this is where you've let down through pressure through conformity this is where the letdown has come notice in verse 9 you looked for much and lo it come to little and when you brought it home i did blow upon it why saith the lord of hosts because of mine house that is ways and you run every man unto his own house god is occupied with his house let me just say this his house is not made of brick and mortar his house is a living mystical body of jesus christ his house is his word his word is the temple where the saints come together and worship faith worships in the temple of the revealed word is that right yes so it comes he's calling us god is zealous let me tell you friends not too many people this is why you find organizations this is why you find uh people on the sidelines because not too many people have are built and desire this so many come to a place and say this is enough that's a little overboard that's a little too much you're asking for but you see god is not going he's not going to pet us god's not going to say to you or say well you know what i'll lessen a little bit you're right this is a hard age man it's a bad time pandemic's on and whatever gimmick's on and man we'll just we'll let we'll loosen it god don't operate that way but in the midst of chaos in the midst of situation god sends his word to bring order to bring deliverance to give strength to his children to stem the tide and stand toe to toe in the face of adversity and say is that the best you got come on church oh come on now therefore heaven over you is stayed from dew and the earth has stayed from her fruit and i called for a drought upon the land and upon the mountains upon the corn upon the new wine upon the oil and upon that which the ground bringeth forth and upon men and upon cattle and upon all the labor of the hands oh my you're talking about an awakening an awakening because can you imagine what was on the text threads or the facebook posts or the twitter accounts being blown up of hashtag under persecution hashtag i'm trialing it hashtag and god lets them know this ain't persecution this ain't persecution this isn't trialing it what's happening i have permitted this because you have put other things ahead of me simple that's what god said that's what's going on see god doesn't want him to be confused the word comes so that we're not walking around in confusion and you know given out well i'm under trial and i'm under persecution and well this is coming my way there are all of those folds as we started looking at last week there are many folds to chastening but in this avenue god is bringing correction i mean as a parent you we wouldn't be much of a parent if you don't correct your children come on friends ain't much of a parent and i'm not talking about when they get on your nerves i'm talking about correction with if this goes on like this now god help us when they get older come on friends if they throw a temper tantrum now they'll be throwing a temper tantrum when they get older preach brother think a will so the question arises this is where the question arises god has let them know hey all this that you've been putting out there it's been me i stayed the dude i stopped all this your labor you weren't lazy you were working like crazy even your money when you brought it in your income has been increased but when it's been laid down i blew upon it now god permitted it now once you think about this you say man by the same if that's awful strong correction is never something that's enjoyable for the season it's never enjoyable for the season but afterward it'll yield present pleasant fruits afterwards those that would be exercised by it i want you to think of it are they going to to receive the correction of the word of god this is really unfolded pretty plain before i feel like this is i don't just feel i know by the leading of the holy spirit that this is this is so present with where we're at in this age let me just say this to you friends every one of us in here this is why the holy ghost is not an option the holy ghost is not an option in our lives personally by the new birth and the holy ghost is not an option in our services the holy ghost is not optional daily living by the word of god and praying it's not an option it's an hour to be very very fervent you say why do you say that because we need the discernment by the word of almighty god without his discernment we're just like these individuals are we begin to call things okay good and all this is going on instead of really identifying what's the real problem going on here i want to say this how many people look uh psalm 73 asap asap was a let's say a song leader he was a leading musician there in in in in in the time of of david he began to look at everybody else man these guys are prospering man this is good the green bay the green bay tree prospers man look at them everything the wicked look how they're doing it man the test and the trout asap said he got his eyes on that and he said my foot had slipped he got his eyes on the wrong thing because it looked like man they're prospering they're everything going their way everything looks good but asap said once i came into the sanctuary then i understood the end of that you see just looking at it in the natural it looks like everything's going their way man that because this flesh always wants the easy way this flesh does every one of our flesh it don't matter what your dna is every one of our flesh wants the easy way but takes god there thanks be to god there is a part of himself on the inside when he would make himself known in this hour that would rise up and choose the harder way and every moment every moment every moment is choosing the harder way every day of our life is a choice every moment of our life is a decision choosing the harder way are you hearing me now overcoming is not us being pulled through a pipe it's choices we make sometimes we make the choices that are good other times we make the choices that are wrong oh my you might be thinking boy can't wait for fellowship to start but this the question arises are they going to receive correction from the word because i want you to think the rich young ruler he came jesus loved him jesus said it like this putting it in the words of the prophet and the message come follow me you said he was a model young man a respectful young man he would be a young man that probably somebody would say boy i'd like my daughter to date that guy he's a he's a he's a he's a worker man he's got a good 401k i don't care if he's got a 401k i don't care if he's got diamond studded wheels does he got the holy ghost because all those other things will perish but if you've got true riches on the inside let me tell you something there'll be glory in that castle brother there'll be glory there'll be joy unspeakable there'll be a stabilizing in that home when testing trials comes there's an anchor there's an anchor and absolute that that home is held together by the presence of almighty god oh my think of it this correction because the richer and ruler he went on man he he's after after face to face with the lord jesus he went on he said man everything's going good he started building bigger barns is that right come on the prophet of god ties those two together he brings that two together brother man brings us to the place to show us he said notice what he said when he lifted up his eyes in hell it came back to him when he was in hell and that's what hell is really a torment is when a person has to reflect and it's before before him before him you had an opportunity you had a choice you didn't move on it you didn't act on it that's torment because hell isn't the lake of fire hell is the place like the county jail indictment has been made and it's awaiting the trial of the white throne judgment is that right god never sins god never sends a man into that place of the lake of fire without the first being a tribe is that right so i'd say it like this it's a blessing god bringing correction to our life and when we can agree with it and yield to it you see the real problem that was going on in the lives and the hearts because how many knows is faith that operates every promise of god it's faith that operates your life faith is what an awakening they had when this would come forth to their life because the real problem was a lack of faith now that would seem in our in our in our minds how could it be a lack of faith they were standing against the adversaries in the beginning but remember in the message perfect faith brother random takes us to peter stepping out of the boat and he said peter when he stepped out of the boat had substance faith are you hearing me now but he started looking at the waves and he began this is the words of the prophet begin to lose substance why his focus was on the wrong thing and the focus at first was it's him it's him i want to go to him i want to go and lord bid me to come come peter stepped out of the boat not even not even hesitating but as he started to walk the waves around him rising up he started to focus upon the waves the word that spoke to him and said come peter that word was above every wave it didn't even stop these begin to consider here i am i'm there i'm walking in a place that this is not even conventional to thinking but what was happening the more that he entertained it he began to lose substance faith peter one thing about peter wasn't too ashamed to raise up his hand and say help me lord save me lest i perish oh glory brother bantam you're aware you take the message desperation brother brown will take that exact thought and he'll apply it with hearts and lives that have been struck with sickness then he'll also apply it to lies that he said they've come a mistake has been made he'll also apply it we're lives that haven't went fully on into the baptism of the holy ghost but he's bringing it and he says may i encourage you this morning to take a hold of the promises of god that belong to you because satan is nothing but a bluff i'm tell you this word is not a backup plan this word is not a compromising word this word is a said this belongs to me it belongs to the kingdom of god and i'm here to take what rightfully belongs to me no peace treaty get the peace tables out of here because we ain't making no peace pack it's like a situation like this could arise around our lives think about it in the natural sometimes the things that arise and we think man what's going on in our body right and of course you know we go to resident dr google or better yet some of us try to i'm feeling a little sick um you got antibiotics i agree with you boy you could stand up here and rebuke that right now couldn't you nursing man come on now sometimes you know we're you know looking at things here and there and and friends we all know this one of the things that's just like with all the the medicines and things like that it only many times it works and it's only masking what conditions are on the surface and never really getting down to what's going on inwardly you see when you sit down with the doctor that you tell the doctor i'm having a pain here i'm going to cramp there i'm having this or i'm getting dizzy here i'm getting you know and you know they're saying they'll they're they're listening to what you're saying there's also things maybe pressure points whenever you know what i'm talking about you they can only respond upon what you are sensing or feeling outwardly then they begin to then take that and apply their knowledge to try to determine what is causing these outward symptoms well well well well we are in the presence of dr jesus i'm telling you there's no doubt if we could re-read haggai chapter one they were taking the tylenols nothing wrong the advils and somebody else's antibiotic and oh man i got this is going on and this is going on what they needed was is some real examination to get down to what's going on sometimes when you hear the ministering of the word the chastening of the lord that brings correction on getting slack and you know coming to the house of god praying and reading let me tell you something that is not a minister trying to get you to measure up with their standard this is the standard of the word and it's things that you can see outwardly that speak there's something going on inwardly and the only way god can help us we've got to be honest with him hallelujah friends oh my i want you just to think of this in haggai chapter 5 verse 1 the bible said then the prophets haggai the prophet and zechariah the son of edu prophesied unto the jews that were in judah and jerusalem in the name of the god of israel even unto them then rose up jerubal the son of shatil and jeshua the son of josedec and began to build the house of god which is at jerusalem and with them were the prophets of god helping them now i want to just say this i want to say it to you this scripture here in ezra five is the parallel of what's taking place in hagiai one hadiyai and zechariah were not major prophets they were minor prophets but they were moved by the word of the lord and notice it wasn't a new word it wasn't a new vision it wasn't a well we can't do it this way so we'll go around this way no god won't change his program god's program remains the same when god instituted or brought forth even the program there on the day of pentecost remember that's the same program that is applied right now in this present time that you and i are living in let me give me a little bit more juice up here brothers so i want you to think of this the prophets they spoke in the name the characteristic the very character of almighty god the name of god this is his word revealed calling it back that this is what god expects to be done now once you think of this for a moment think of this they need an examination by the word they don't need a pep rally pep rally ain't going to do it they need an examination by the word i hope you're hearing me now the word of god when the spirit of god is moving it's not a pep rally it's a time for examination in our lives is that right you can be right under the anointing of the holy spirit but you've got to welcome him in and welcome it in to examine in your life it's not just about boy that was a good service my i felt the presence of god it's about bringing it home and saying god where am i at in my life where in my life can there be growth lord these are the prophets standing here it would be this right here would be the equating like that of the ministry of ephesians 4 under under the ministry of jeremiah under the ministry of daniel see god is a god of order like when micah came up there and they brought mike up there remember ahab said i don't want him up here i like all these guys that pat me on the back tell me what a good guy i am i hate that guy every time i go to hear him he gets wrapped down in my life that was the chastening of the lord and ahab despised let me tell you what that was it was the spirit of grace grace listen grace is not what the church world defines it grace defines the everything the church world defines grace and what is it it's a prostitute it becomes an unclean woman it becomes somebody that can show up to church and live any other kind of life oh god's got a lot of grace that's not true grace the bible says there in hebrews 12 let us have grace that we might serve him acceptably it's grace that comes that tells us where we're wrong it's grace that comes down and brings correction in our life that's grace but it all depends on whether we'll receive that grace that's not how the world defines grace but i don't think there's any i know there's no better mri than the word of god i know a lot of people i've been through the tube myself you know you go in there and they had to you know look at my back you know about 16 years ago you've been they tell you to bring music in or whatever more and you know you're in that tube and it's your god help me but that's what we need by the word of god we need an mri that can get an imaging that sees all around friends listen that's not comfortable to our flesh but this is a time to discern between the flesh and the spirit the flesh will never side with the word but the inner man on the inside there's a desire to line up with that word there's times where you got to tell your flesh shut up and sit down and i'm talking about your feelings my feelings our attitude you got to say shut up i'm put in charge here not you they that are the sons of god are led by their feelings no that's not what it said that might be the new whatever translation but then but the real word of god said the spirit of god is led the sons of god are led by the spirit of god is that right we need that mri the word of god in hebrews 4 coming down and really bringing discernment into our lives piercing getting down to where it's at to expose and and what's going on remember you know i've made this statement to you here throughout the times that we've been ministering and uh you know just just as we're going just following his leading but brother branham you're aware of how brother brandon would take about this nation that we live in and he ties it together even with organizational life he says we're living off of a past reputation i mean this nation still calls themselves a christian nation what a lie yes sir it's not a christian nation but why are they doing that they're looking back to something but god never respects goes by and judges us based on what we were it's what we are now because remember brother brown picks that that quote up and he says god never respected israel for what they was it's for what they are now this is why let me just say it like this when they said the time has not come that was their thinking that was not god's thoughts their thoughts their reasoning have begin to take preeminence in their life look at the result the result of reasoning in the beginning led to the fall the results of reasoning leads to pushing the promises of god away because man is looking at can he bring the promise to pass it's not can man bring it to pass it's god who made the promise it's god who'll bring it to pass all god asks for his lives that's willing to yield and submit and surrender and like mary be it unto me lord according to that word god never asked you and i to fulfill the word god is the one who interprets the word by bringing it to pass he's the one that fulfills it and the bride remember pick up your pen and write the bride knows that it must be him inside of her fulfilling the word of god so a past reputation that's why we must be the people of now somebody say now there's a lot i wish i could preach a message i've looked at that for a long time the people of now in one time a vision no longer vision prophecy fulfilled is that right standing at the river jordan what was one time prophecy now was history is that right brother random identifies that and what is the attraction on the mount he said what was one time prophecy remember it was being announced prophecy then he could be able to declare standing at that moment it's no longer prophecy it's history it's taken place now that word moves into the bride body so if we're the bride of jesus christ the word manifested in this hour and that's that's the manifestation of the hour is the bride of jesus christ yeah that's that's a man then now are we the sons of god now is the time of salvation now is the time of rapture we're not living in the time of promise we're living in the time of fulfillment now that's that's how our lives listen friends if we can really take this in and i'm just just just following here we really take it into our lives and live our lives now living every moment is if he came the next moment we're living close to him we're people of the now let me tell you friends in this hour i'd be very straight but loosely following the lord you're going to be left behind you've got to get all the way into jesus christ i'm not just talking about going along with it mentally and saying we believe it remember a doctor looks at symptoms you can't ignore symptoms right i know sometimes we you know we go around and we have symptoms that when did you take something did you do this hey you need to go see the doctor i don't want to see the doctor right unless we don't want to go through the trouble because we might say you need some tests done come on friends it happens you know somebody looks and says hey that's days off work man nobody wants to do it you know where there's tests in right injecting dye and twisting this here and doing this here and doing that there but if they're interested in you've got to get to the root of the problem that's what this message came to do is to really get to the root of the problem so brother samuel how can you say that because in revelations 3 they believe the spirit says i'm rich and i don't have need of nothing let me preach now can i preach that same spirit is a spirit of this age it doesn't stay out there and say well i don't leave the barriers of the methodist church i won't leave the barriers of the catholic church that same spirit comes right amongst this message i've got the message i've got a computer i've got the quotes i know the message i know who are you same spirit i am rich and increased with goods and i don't have need of nothing in other words i don't need rebuke i don't need chastening i don't need corrected i get the leading of the holy ghost from myself heaven sounding sweeter it's true friends we're living in this time those are not that's not comfortable it's not even comfortable having to say it and preach it but it's necessary in this hour these walls don't keep spirits out your knowledge of the message don't keep demons away it takes the living presence of the living fire of almighty god baptizing you on the inside in your soul come on friends the same cherubim that stood there at the gate in eden and would not permit entrance back to the tree of life that same anointing are you hearing me now that same anointing is upon the bride of jesus christ it's a bride that's standing there upon this word oh she's terrible as an army with banners a beautiful arrayed in the righteousness of jesus christ but she's going to stand on the word of god and the word will not be compromised because she's promised there is a rapture on daniel curry i remember brother brown talked about daniel curry that's why i think how the lord's put it very close to us here we don't need a picture we don't need a picture we need a mirror i need a mirror a mirror that shows the now because there's a lot of things we can talk about of the past i want you to think of this there was victories in the past but you got to have victory today you don't get victory today from living off victories in the past that's only a mirage that only comes down to what it is in haggai one where you know what they're just going day by day listen you're not meant just to live well just i'm just living day by day if i can just oh i tell you church just i want you all just to have a praise break with me i made it to church this morning shame on you nobody feels like well glory to god you made it to church this morning everybody had the press to be here ain't no pats on the back for that if you really love god you will be in the house of god you'll do everything you can to be here not because of these walls but because of him him him and you see the value of that in our lives i know we're living in an hour right now where streaming has substituted in-person worship but that is not scriptural preach brother samuel oh i will i will it has not and we see it all around it has wanted to substitute i'm telling you the devil's a sly he's a sly fellow what's he trying to do isolate and cut away from the body of jesus christ let me tell you something i felt the presence of god my wife testified to it when i had to stand here and preach to empty pews and a few brothers that were here you know with me at that time and different ones running slides she could testify to it as well as some of you all and i remember sister anna you know saying to me the the question one time i said brother sammy you're preaching like there's a whole house full there i said well you know what it's just how god has sovereignly worked it at that moment god sovereignly worked it at that moment needs were being met are you hearing me now but you recognize that within all of this right here there was god had given grace and we felt the presence of god but friends we are ordained to be a body of believers now i realize i realize you can preach on these things and you know sometimes people get ruffled they get all this and that and then you have my you know start coming for a while then fade back around but real listen the reality is a doctor is only identifying symptoms we're not giving tylenols and advils we're trying to point you there's something lacking there there's something in the way be sure that you've taken the medicine fully in your life when they give you medicine you know how they usually tell you 10 days right 14 days sometimes you look at those pills they could graces how many times a day 42 times a day 10 days here you are walking around with your home depot homer bucket got my pills with me today right come on let's be honest now oh by day four we're like i'm feeling pretty good man no no sniffles i'm good to go we'll pull back from that antibiotic still got six days left sometimes the symptoms come back then again the other time the thing that hit us is only stronger the next time and more resistance because it didn't get killed off all the way before are you healing me now this is why when brother adam preaches the message token in jeffersonville he refers in the beginning middle and in to the token being the medicine that is right before us and if you take the medicine fully into your life it's there to apply to every situation that comes by it'll address let me tell you something these pills brother are not some cheap generic pills these pills pack the original potent power of the holy ghost i'm telling you these pills brother they are full of the antivenom that reacts and takes on that serpent bite that curse that was there in our life if we could just take the medicine so brother samuel i'm saying we need to evaluate what we're doing we need to evaluate what we're doing we need to listen friends this is the bible we need to speak plainly in the book of habakkuk write the vision plainly that he that readeth may run god wrote it plainly in this hour he interpreted it plainly why that we might rotten there's a time in an hour we must speak with vagueness with not vague but plainness in this hour daniel curry my goodness how did we get away from daniel curry but i want you to think about daniel curry just for a moment i this was drawn to this even some weeks ago just thinking because daniel curry remember he the brother bram dramatized that he stood before the gate and he's it's a drama standing there and you know comes the angel comes to the gate and says who are you i'm daniel curry okay let me looking in the let me see here see curry we don't find anything here and we know this is a drama but he's standing there brother bram says about that time how daniel curry described the dream he said he was taken into the presence of that light and he said that light became so bright and in the presence of that light as he stood there this is daniel curry his testimony of the dream he said when he was asked pointed questions did you ever lie did you ever steal did you ever and he said i thought i had never but in the presence of that light i realized i had so what does light do it exposes he said i thought on and on daniel curry went i thought i thought but i realized this is why that we must have the light of the hour shining down in our lives i never forget my daddy one time went to a situation that people that weren't you know they you know they lay out a church didn't want to come in and they've got you know a tongue to give and a prophecy to give and everything and so my daddy just went there and he told him he said look he said any prophecy or tongues that's for you that's for you don't bring them into the church that's for you now my daddy went against tongues in prophecy he believed in it but for you to sit home and then come in like you're more spiritual than everybody else though anything you get from god that's for you look in the mirror and recite it you know my dad was a he could be very plain spoken but god had him here for a reason and for a purpose and for a season is that right but here's what was said you know my dad mentioned to the to the to to the individual and i'm saying this plainly not to disclose things privacy i'm showing you i want to show you something is pressed on my heart that when my dad said you were he said brother bannon tells us not to forsake from the scriptures not to forsake to assemble ourselves together if you've got the love of god in your heart you can't wait for those church doors to open and the individuals rose up and said that doesn't bother me when he says it but when you say it it makes me mad credible in there why what's the difference when the word is standing in flesh and discerning now conditions i tell you only the bride can stand in the now the now isn't an easy place to stand but now is a place of examination by the word as many as i love not as many as love me as many as i love i chasten and rebuke be zealous therefore and repent it's about the word coming down and the word bringing discernment in reality i think back on that time with my dad my daddy wasn't against he's trying to help the individual to see the present conditions we are in of course we're living even in a greater time right now 2022. everything you do it's got to be politically correct right everything's got to be you know sweetened with powdered sugar powdered sugar and they call that love listen friends love is corrective we can be we can go to the bush and beat the leaves off of it and never address the mites that's eating on it we've got to address what's eating on the bush when symptoms are coming up in our life sin is coming out i'm not talking about going out and grabbing a fifth of whiskey or running out to the bar room i'm talking about unbelief and unbelief displays itself when it doesn't walk according to the word of almighty god simple things that god has asked us to do and it's up to us whether or not that will we will heed to it can i have just a few more moments i want you to understand this their expectation my friends i thank god for his mercy for our lives can you think what these are people of god but just wait they've got the promise of deuteronomy 28 if you hearken unto my voice if you follow my commandments diligently i will bless your seed i will water your land i will provide the dew from heaven oh the blessings of god i will all those natural blessings and they were in the process of thinking you know what i just need to do more i need to do more i need to do more and what they what really they they got away from is surrendering to the will of god can i preach for just a moment when brother branham preaches the message enticing spirits hear me now brother brown when he preaches that message he talks about people they'll go for gifts they'll study intensely they'll fast he said they'll do all of that instead of surrendering to the word of god because to surrender to the word of god you've got to surrender your nature and your will all the studying all the fasting all the praying now i'm talking on things that your eye would look at and say man what are you talking about doing when you want people to study when you want people to fast when you want him to do this but under under the headship of the world not in place of we're not saved by works it's by grace through faith are you saved we don't earn we don't earn god's favor we don't earn his merit but when we are redeemed this is out of the message to preach when we've been redeemed we no longer want our own choice he has been our choice and that's all that matters when something comes along in our life a thing that's presented and maybe we can't see it all together we gather as a family husband is praying and saying now how is this going to affect our life it's evaluated that way we are people of the now they had an expectation brother gabriel they were confused god promised us in deuteronomy 28. i mean the crops are bad there's no do god promised this but god comes by way of his word to show them i gave my word but there's necessary conditions that must be met for that word to be fulfilled now you and i could not meet them conditions on our own god don't give it to you and i and say hey guess what the conditions are god sends his word he declares that word and he declares it not just by speaking it but by demonstrating it demonstrating he's a now god he demonstrates his word his presence as it comes down to our lives personally and then as we will yield and surrender it transforms us to do what meet the conditions for that word to be fulfilled we could go to this with abraham and sarah so forth it took god coming on the scene is that right abraham had received the message abraham was god's messenger is that right anders and the same god who spoke to abraham at the beginning that same god came there and stood in flesh and said i'm going to write it again i'm going to count in pharah's flesh i will visit her according to the time of life the same god who has veiled here now with the same god will be veiled in sarah's life what was it what does it do what what would hinder this what would hinder isaac from coming doubt in sarah's heart if thou sayest to thy mountain and don't doubt in thy heart the word came to deal with doubt was sarah not the promised one was she not the promised chosen womb are we not the chosen womb the prepared ground of god but god comes himself to deal with and bring us into the rightful condition to where doubts are dissolved and there's a same one present this morning that was there in the time of the babylonian kingdom the holy ghost is a dissolver of all doubts everything had to come back to the right order had to come back to the right order i want to say this deuteronomy 28 about the natural provision last week i think we stopped on that part where god was speaking to the people seek you first the kingdom of god and all these other things will be added to you deuteronomy 28 was of their natural provision here's what god was saying god said i want you to know my benefits you know when you sit down to to go for a job you want to know what are the benefits on this job when you're getting paid this and this well he's a he's a who comes to god must believe he's a rewarder and them that diligently seek him right and there's benefits forgetting on all his benefits right but you see the benefits was god was letting them know you just put me first the focus is upon my work the focus is upon my kingdom and everything else i will ensure it doesn't hinder you i'll provide for you i'll cause your enemies to be at peace with you yo you mean god they're going to be my buddies and they say they'd be your buddies i said i'll cause them to be at peace with you how does that happen by seeking first the kingdom of god and then all these other things i'll bless you around i'll drop the dew i'll do all these other things will be added unto you so the ultimate and necessary condition is faith faith and satan's objective is always to try to come at faith remember as we look to just made those comments in the beginning on losing substance is to try to come and try to disrupt faith he can come that way with thoughts and you can entertain those thoughts listen now he can also he comes in a way there's traps set all around but the focus is not on traps you there's the devil has traps everywhere i'm not going to read all the quotes but there's traps all around and you will stumble and you do stumble but remember what a trap is it's not something with a sign on it that says hey hermano carlos there's a trap right here just come right up this way and no what is a trap i'm not a trapper i'm not trapper zachary we ain't going there you want a trap you can call brother wayne up here he'll help you but a trapper i've watched the guys i've seen the videos on what they do they got to boil the traps you got to take the scent off of them and then you've got to bring them in an area where that person walks animal walks don't read into anything you have to but you can't you know let me polish this trap up you've got to place it so as though there's no alarm to what's going on no scent nothing to give it away it's just like you know an animal i've watched them watch the deer come out watch them right around the blinder bobby you know what i'm talking about man hey brother bobby told me a long time ago first time he took me honey said you close your eyes you hunker you're just like the guy standing out playing hide and seek close your eyes hope they don't see you but a trap it's so easy to walk into it but don't be focused on traps like i don't want to make a mistake no keep your eyes on him if you keep your eyes on him he'll guide you through and you keep your eyes on him that if you fall into a trap get your eyes on him he'll see you out of that trap because we're not going to be well you know i'm going to be free from traps but neither are we saying oh well i can't look no we reckon that traps are always all around but sometimes the way traps come remember i i know i've i've experienced a lot of things seen a lot of things over the years as a pastor and coming in even to a few years before you know taking over here in the assembly i've seen traps i've seen traps come around until i just decrease it just a little bit right just a little bit i've seen them just i've seen it decrease here or seen things to where the traps would come in many different forms and one of the things that i've watched and how traps and things can come at times is when things get out of god's divine order can i read this quote in closing brother brown i'm in two places in the message he deals with what's an overcoming life and he talks about the order he says any christian will think of others before himself i'm on the second paragraph of god using his gift any christian will think of others before himself every christian tries to put god first i'm not gonna get all the way through this one hope you understand i as in looking at these things and the spirit of god just picks them up tries to put god first you know what that tells me brother brian it's a trying it's an effort it's not just a automatic it's true that when the holy ghost has come there is a holy life that's lived out automatically let me just put it to you like this there's certain doors that you can come to like right here this door is not like the supermarket door you know how the supermarket door does you can walk up to it [Music] you walk in with your hands in your pockets and then there's some doors if you do that right you can kind of get used to doors being open right and then what if it says automatic door and here you are you want yeah honey that's good pow what said it was an automatic door you see there's some things in the word of god that's just like peter it was automatic doors when it opened in the prison and then there's other things that we have to open there's things that we have to do that god will not do for us god won't god won't come to the house of god for us he won't pray for us he won't read for us he won't get into the message for us no no no no no what kind of father would he be man we'd be really spoiled wouldn't we i'm gonna read this one we just end tries to that that that tells me it's a battle and that just tells me and how many knows it's a battle it's a battle don't get down because it's a battle it is a battle let me just drop you this when god came there in the message of haggai he said the lord of hosts host means army that's gathered for war it's a battle every day is a battle every moment is a battle and you or i can get weary because of the battle but remember who your strength is your strength is the lord it's got to be a strength friends on the inside i believe i think all of us believe in here i believe in rededication of our lives i believe as we come to the house of god when the word's coming forth it ought to cause us to come to a place of examination we want to rededicate our lives when i'm listening to the message it brings me into that place sitting there the other morning in the wee hours listening to the message indictment brothers i was sitting right there at the end of the message with my hands up with the prophet god i want to fully consecrate my life hallelujah i mean you might be at work you may not be able to do that but right away you're listening to a work right there in your heart you say man lord that's me lord jesus that's me lord so be it lord god think of the words when the prophet came from beyond the curtain of time just keep pressing just keep pressing just keep pressing limb now now press on little bride press on little lily press on you look in your life and as i said we believe in rededication but friends listen throughout this congregation those are streaming those be very honest before god have you had an original dedication in your life i don't say that to be indifferent i don't say that to be mean i don't say that to say that the whole of this congregation everyone knows where they're at but it's an hour it's an hour of now has there been an original dedication in your life see rededication isn't when we come to church and then we go back in the world and oh we get cold and we go back to our own ways that's that's not rededication re-dedication is a re of what has originally taken place in a life and we need rededication but we also need an original dedication too and every time god dedicated his temple his work he dedicated it by himself by his presence coming down to where nobody could add or take away from it even the priest could not minister in the time of psalm nobody can add or take away from what god does when the fire of god comes down it not only cleanses but it sets that life on fire you see the rededication as we go through times and things in our life and we need to rededicate our lives we must rededicate our lives we have to look and really take inventory in our life to see what's going on it's kind of so it's so bringing it not real shouting well sometimes it's not real shouting but his presence is still here very sweet it's very sweet very sweet and very tender it's the same tenderness that brother graham talks about and standing in the gap when that revelation of jesus christ strikes your heart and the swin the sweetness and the tenderness of his person the love of the world is gone there's no desire for the things of the world but the desire and the love is for him and to him and you know i i can't i can stand and i can be honest with you you know there's times and things that throughout throughout the years when i've sat in that office sometimes corrections come right there in that office of things i've had to say sometimes waiting sometimes a situation that comes which that's no different that's that comes as a pastor within that certainly not things that i enjoy doing at all but even right here as we come together whether it's for the samuel standing here or we have another minister that comes in it's the holy spirit that's speaking to our lives and this is where we want to say god i want to take this home i want to take this home i want my life to be further changed i don't want to come i don't want to i don't want to leave here the same way that i came in i don't want to leave here because friends it takes a love affair down on the inside many people love god in their spirit in their mind but to love him from your soul that's the love of god that's the work of the holy spirit that's the shekinah glory that's the anchor that's the thai post that's the absolute that's the real baptism of the holy ghost and it puts us in motion for him think about that and we just stop here to today but that thought will we receive correction i i myself i want to stand i want the word to examine my life not just when i come here i want an examination when i'm in prayer and i tell you right now there's things as i was fellowshipping with my wife and just a little little time and we were fellowshipping and i told her i said you know honey i said one of the things i said that i'm so grateful for they said it may not sound like a lot i said but i can look back and i can see in when i look back in my life and i can see things and tell me when god as my walk first going with the lord certain things that you could see in your life you just be very honest pride see it's what i how i identify when god brings it out now for somebody else they pride but see there's things that god can bring certain things out in our lives so brother simon how could you be thankful because what i'm thankful for is i can see that and i can know that i need his grace right now to be able to stand within certain things and and see certain things and but to have a heart that's willing to be corrected that's what i told my wife i said i thank god that to be able to rejoice in to see my weaknesses because you know why he's my strength all that does is bring to my attention these are channels i want to flow through lord these are my weaknesses but if you'll surrender if you surrender your weaknesses to me then i'll pour my strength through your weaknesses aren't you glad for that oh my let's pray heavenly father lord jesus i i thank you this morning lord i don't know lord i don't know what we would do without you lord just as i expressed moments ago lord it takes discernment personally by you coming to our lives to bring things to bring things out more to expose things and i thank you father for your love thank you for your mercy lord as i stand here oh god with this the congregation this morning lord the very purchase of your blood that is you fought more of them than you did of your own blood for you were willing to give your own blood to purchase our ransom now lord jesus is that with that value that you have bestowed upon our lives [Music] and father we we move lord god under under this word lord that speaks of that value in our lives god you won't allow anything to be mixed with that value but father that it would be fully displayed in our lives lord i realize i speak lord to a mixed audience i speak lord throughout this congregation lord and it's for every one of us no matter where we're at in our walk but i i pray god i pray may there be such a desperation that strikes in every heart to live now [Music] work now while it's day live in the now right now now we are the sons of god not to put off for another moment not to put off to another camp meeting not no now now now now is the day now is the time not not put it back well if my dad hadn't been like this my mom no now there's a there is the i am that i am that is present to deal with the now that can settle settle all disputes oh god may it resonate lord in every heart and every life god the strongest person in here lord mentally or physically is no match for the strength of satan in this hour your prophet puts it in the message contest satan is powerful and he's getting more powerful [Music] but there's an answer for that and that answer is yourself lord that word of the living god coming on the inside where a vessel lord is emptied up lord but now to get that space filled filled with the holy ghost to be full of the spirit of the living god a surrender may be such a determination lord if things of this world lord that's wanted to come in our sisters lord our brothers lord whether clothing make up lord things of this world looking at things there shouldn't be i pray right now lord they would just rise lord god in the very pulsation of the holy spirit and go to war against that lord may they be like david and step off the hill this morning and say today you've spoke your last words granted lord may they lord come to that place lord may there be a facing a showdown lord may there be a raising of goliath's head lord in their life i pray god may it be such a press the bible speaks to us lord that the law and prophets were until john now came the fulfillment of that and in the fulfillment of it grace is displayed the word made flesh and it announces to us that every man must press press into the kingdom of god it's not something that's given we must press we must take hold we must lay hold we must take that which god you have placed before us and declare this rightfully belongs to you as my son as my daughter god i pray this morning right now if there's one show lord here or streaming lord that's never come into that original dedication i don't care if they're young you don't care if they're old don't care they've been around this message all their life but if they've never had an original dedication in their life lord may this be a moment lord god that father not only my words lord under your inspiration that would pray this prayer lord but may their heart lord be inclined o god to the pulsation of the holy spirit to say yes lord god i want that original dedication of the baptism of the holy ghost i want that lord i must have that pillar of fire lord in my life oh god granted lord i pray oh jesus may lord god that same holy spirit move down lord into those lies may this be a moment lord that sets it in motion lord god oh granted lord jesus maybe they've waited around maybe they waited and waited they become discouraged things have come their way but here you've come to let them know like you did lord in haggai one want mercy and grace to us lord father throughout this building lord this morning you spoke to us about traps oh it's so easy this quote lord i went to start reading on the old order of overcoming it's set forth brother ram tells us tries to put god first that's what i try to do he said then your family comes next then ourselves are last sometimes lord the traps we get into they're not traps of things lord that we would look at lord god when it would come so much that it's noticeable sometimes lord the traps are things that comes around family other things that very innocent very very very innocent but remember that innocency there's a power behind it and that power is to take away oh god i just want to say thank you father i pray god throughout this congregation lord of rededicating of our lives [Music] oh we can sit around and we can talk about the good old days we can talk about the camp meeting but that's now that don't do nothing for us what was in the past what is right now [Music] we can talk about oh my how i was last year no no right now how are we right now oh god you haven't come to condemn us but you've come to expose the enemy because it's an enemy that would creep in to do this and the enemy that would creep in lord to try to discourage your people and the enemy lord that would come in to try to just cause them to take a back seat to just become disheartened to become just sitting down and just kind of going along with the things of life but i believe here this morning god your presence you're here to entertain us lord your prophet takes us in the message fundamental foundation of faith and he says the holy ghost is here to energize us to help us to see that our purpose is not just to go to work come home read the newspaper go to bed get up the next morning go through the same cycle no our purpose is we're channels [Music] branches to be energized by the holy ghost now satan you have thought that you were hidden [Music] but i'm here to tell you you are exposed hallelujah just as much that day when you'll be exposed before leaders of nations and they will say this is the guy who did this you're exposed this morning your fear your doubt your ways you're exposed we don't side with you we side with the word of almighty god and the word speaks against you you're not our friend you're our enemy we're not here to make peace we're here to declare war hallelujah glory peter god in the highest blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah o the lord of hosts the word of the lord has come oh god thank you for your word thank you for this evening message that you've sent to us lord oh what a glorious light it is lord to show up and expose and lord bring a real evaluation in our life [Music] granted lord help us father i pray in jesus precious name jesus precious amen hallelujah let's just worship him a little bit i know we got a fellowship dinner but i let's worship him a little bit here he deserves more than a whole lot a little bit but let's let brother adam tells us when that word has come forth and i i know it's it's been corrective [Music] but this is the thought will we receive correction friends let's not reason it let's receive it let's allow the holy spirit to water down it upon our lives water upon our lives [Music] amen reconsecrating our lives to his purpose hallelujah could we just worship him here just a few moments let the holy spirit let him just rain down and upon that seed that word amen just keep on keep on seeking him keep on talking to him right now this is a time right now a real intimate time it's a time just to continue to really just pouring your heart out inviting him in it's a time where if there's things to be repented of there's time to lay down the life it's a time for the holy ghost to move in fully this is a moment in a time after the word has gone forth to invite the word himself to come in and do what he declared and what he has made known he did not just take us away this morning by way of vision and show us things that we can see in our own lives and then to just leave us there no no no no but he lets us know i i am that way i am your strength i am your life i am your light i'm your all and all i'm your all-sufficiency abraham i'm the lord god almighty hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord i am the strength that you need just take hold take hold oh they'll shady control the strength from their shady eye down whatever the need is this morning draw from el shaddai [Music] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh god oh lord jesus [Music] thank you lord thank you father for speaking lord thank you lord for these services lord you've been taking us
