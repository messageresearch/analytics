see each and every one of you let's just let's just turn our our hearts to the lord in a word of prayer and we just want to be remembering all those needs that you've already taken to the lord in prayer and maybe there's a special request that's on your heart knowing that god he's mindful he knows and he cares amen let's just let's just go to him heavenly father lord we come lord to this this moment in the service lord dear god we thank you father for lord the songs of zion that's went for thank you dear god for lord the reality lord of which you have so touched our hearts lord dear god we thank you father lord that you've made a way for us lord jesus and dear god we just asked lord that tonight lord there's many requests that's been read across this pulpit there's many requests lord that upon the hearts of your children lord perhaps some that were not even wrote down maybe lord something that's just lord very personal to their heart maybe it's lord a question lord dear god we just asked tonight that you would come in a real special way lord your god you know how to answer and how to minister to needs lord in such a way that's it's beyond our our thinking lord you can come and though the words themselves may not be said but yet the spirit of god will so move to reveal that this is your answer so lord we just just want to invite you that you would come lord any lord decision that lord would be weighing upon the hearts of your people i pray tonight god may it just be committed into your hands lord may they receive just a rest lord within that just to lord that it's in your hands you're the one who's guiding you're the one who's directing it oh god and we just asked the lord that your spirit would just just come lord as we would look in your word and may you break the bread of life to us lord dear god we can read we can look at it lord but unless you come lord jesus it only becomes us looking at it lord but we ask that you come lord and just as lord let the word be inspired to our hearts oh god let it just lord come lord with with your anointing upon it and that it would find its place lord within our hearts and our lives we just ask lord that you'll just heal those lord that dear god that may be a little lord down in the spirit lord heal those that lord in their body lord that might be lord experiencing a discomfort of pain lord of sickness lord we just ask that you'll just come in a special way lord whether they be gathered here or whether lord over that of the internet we know lord god that you're not bound to this building lord god and we just pray that lord that you'll just take control now lord may father you speak to our hearts lord and may our lives oh god be challenged and encouraged lord and may the holy spirit o god just come lord in such a measure lord i pray lord that if there's any hearts without you that god they might be failed lord and father that your presence would come lord and refill every one of us lord we pray we just ask these things lord for your glory in the name of jesus christ amen amen if you'll turn with me to matthew 11 once again matthew 11 verse 28 amen we want to go right right back here into the scripture just trying to pick up some of the things that from some time that the lord just really pressed when when the inspiration itself was really dropping here and i want to if we could just look at this three verses of scripture here and the lord jesus as he says come unto me all ye that labor and our and our heavy laden and i will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light amen may god bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated i want to just look at the the thought here tonight on being yoked with christ and we find that here in the scripture that the lord jesus he's giving an invitation and i think that's the most glorious glorious thing that god would give to us is an invitation and you know the invitation is very very personal of how that he would invite us that our lives could be changed and then molded to match his own character and he's the one that's given the invitation he's inviting us that that we might uh yield that he might do what only he can do and when we think of this here the lord jesus as he's bringing this together here when we look at it he's tying together this of of the rest of god and that also of the yoke and showing that his his rest it is where it is that where it is a complete finished work and it's him that is performing what he has already spoken in his word what he already saw concerning you or i and so within that rest we we recognize that this rest israel was given a rest as far as a day that they were to uh to keep in memorial to uh the the finished works of god and we recognize that this this rest itself is where god would pour out of his own life and where that the very burden of sin would be lifted from the life because there's there's no way that a person can actually serve god under the lord of sin so there has to be a relieving of that burden and of that load of sin and we recognize that god there's no one and no one could do this but god came down and he became flesh and he himself became our burden bearer he he took our sins there in gethsemane were there where the decision was made when every all the demons of hell were gathered around and there in the garden of gethsemane the decision was made the battle was won the overcoming was set forth there in gethsemane nevertheless not my will thy will be done we recognize that the scripture would tell us that jesus endured the cross despising the shame of it for the joy that was set before him so the cross he he endured the cross despising the shame because it was what was set before him that joy and that is that his own life the achievement of his life coming to bring you and i loosening the very burden of sin from our life that we might be united with him let me just say it like this that burden of sin you understand that there's been times that in your life and so forth where maybe you've had a disagreement with someone or or something has come up maybe there's been something that's been done maybe you've been wrong and yet it sometimes can be uh hard to maybe look at that person or to see that person or you feel funny of how am i going to respond to them or maybe you did something that you know i shouldn't have done that's a condemnation you're feeling and you're not feeling a liberty and that that is on a very natural level but how much greater on a spiritual level to where that the where that the enemy the one who has laid the traps the one who has ensnared it and because of that first nature then he would come and want to bring condemnation and say well there's no hope for you you can't go on or and and look at your life but it's to recognize that god never expects you nor requires you to serve him under condemnation but quite the contrary he comes to lift and remove that condemnation so that you can serve him freely so you're not serving him under a burden of sin and the real burden of sin is not all the sins that's been committed it's the nature on the inside that is contrary to the word and that's why paul said that the carnal mind is enmity against god because the carnal mind is always about what it can do and i can do this and i can do that the carnal mind is enmity to god but it is the spiritual mind and the only way that we can have a spiritual mind is the holy spirit begins to awaken us to his presence to his reality that there's one here that's greater than me or as jesus could say there's one in the temple that's greater than the temple there's one greater than our own will greater than our own a morality greater than our own strength there's one who is greater and this is why that that when we look at the rest of god and jesus his invitation is come unto me and you will find rest for your souls that rest that where the labor cease and jesus brings us together and he brings it in a manner that would be very familiar the rest the the the hebrews knew about the rest the jews knew about the rest but now he brings it even into a place that they would understand that his rest that entering into that rest is to become yoked with him now when you think of a yoke we know that uh a yoke itself as jesus is placing here we we recognize that that is that is what goes upon that of oxen or beast of burden or bullocks and and there's a wagon where there's a plow there's there's a service to be performed now in this country here uh you'd be kind of hard-pressed to find uh the bullock and the oxen and them pulling the carts but you know when i was in the philippines that was nothing to see that it was nothing to go by uh the rice fields and see the water buffalo uh the that of the the oxen of the bullet and here it is it's it's harnessed to a plow and maybe there's a little boy behind it or or you find one that's pulling a carton a cart of maybe a produce that's going into the area the even though the the the ox itself it has power and the ox itself is built to be able to pull that wagon with the produce or the plow or whatever but there's got to come that which will tie together that oxen to the load to the burden to the plow to the wagon and there's only one thing that can do that and that's a yoking together and the yoke itself is that which which brings uh the uniting together and this is where jesus could say and he brings together the yoke of the word and the rest of the holy spirit because within the yoke if we just simply put it in this manner the yoke is the word amen it's the word but in order to be you in order to be really yoked when he's saying take upon take my yoke upon you he's this is an invitation you take my yoke upon you but the only way that yoke can be taken is it is necessary that the spirit of god is the one who brings the harnessing to the world you see we can carry the bible we can carry the message we can know it we can quote it but that's not being harnessed to it to be harnessed to the word to actually take the yoke upon is where our life actually reflects the life of the word and we've been united by the holy ghost that's not a work of man that's not a work of man you could have every man in the world pray for you a man can't give you the holy ghost it takes god to give you the holy ghost but god never overrides our sovereign will many times we want to see things change or we want to see this life change and listen we ought to pray and what we're praying for we're looking to the god of what he has done in our life he's the same god that brings the change in other lives is that right the word the word will never override our will it will not do it it must be a surrendering of our will nevertheless not my will thy will be done amen is that right so now think back to the to the services we were looking at on thursday and on sunday and when jesus here he is standing and he reveals himself as the lord of the sabbath what was that given as a rest of the memorial of a finished work here the lord jesus stands within that moment and he speaks to the man with a withered hand he speaks to the man that has an infirmity he speaks remember to the one who does not have any eyes he spits upon the ground makes clay puts it on him and now the man receives his sight we find on and on that many of the miracles and creation and restoring of life but i want you to understand this the withered hand did not come and be made whole because simply the word was spoken then the man did not get up off of the clock simply because the word was spoken the eyes did not come about simply because the word was spoken there had to be a belief in him who was speaking and obeyed now the man could not was not had his eyes he himself did not put that a clay upon his life but obedience is citing in in unison and confession to what the word is saying so this is it's very important the word it will never override our own will and jesus would set it forth in the uh set forth in the gospels we can go back in the old testament james will pick it up and we find on and on that no man can serve two masters he's either going to love one and hate the other it's impossible to serve two masters and so when we when we think of this i want to just take this example that uh that the lord through this this message the ever-present water from the rock and i want you to look how we as we're going through this tonight this is just what stood out to me some weeks ago when looking at this thought on what burden and looking at god's working with israel to bring israel out of egypt that was all god and i don't think there's anybody here that would dispute that israel got in a place hey they were comfortable in egypt for a long time but eventually things started to tighten down there's things that started to become personal to them they started to cry out they were praying but now their prayers the changing of the prayers remember god doesn't hear it's not in our prayer that the words that god hears that's not what god hears god hears the motive and objective of our heart it's what's behind the heart that's why you know you know when we're praying that's why brother brown talked about the little boy that just said the abcs he said because i don't know what words to say but he said and brother branson after all it's not our words that he's listening to it is the motives and objectives of our heart now i want you to think of this journey here was israel down in egypt god was working on their heart and the same time that god is working on their heart he's also working on moses heart it's god working to bring this together now brother bran said now when israel was over in goshen just having a glorious time the sun never went down the plagues never struck them while they were just having a glorious time just like you did when you first got saved everything the birds sang different everybody was sweet oh my everything was dandy when you first got saved he's talking about when your life you you you've repented and you you come to that place to say lord forgive me of my sins and you take him as your savior you know sometimes we get so far out that we forget the simplicity that we still have access to that that the unloading and and the removing of hindrances in our life still operates with that simple same principle and that is to confess which is to repent and say lord forgive me and it's a release of a burden but here notice as he says the birds sing different everybody was sweet oh everything was just dandy when you first got saved then come the trying time the chastening sanctifying time sanctifying yourself from the things of the world laying aside the weights that does so easily beset you you a man you had to stop your smoking stop your drinking stop you're going to the pool room your all night card parties all those things you had to sanctify yourself from them by the faith in the blood of jesus christ sanctifying yourself now i want you to catch this very simple but how is that sanctifying how is it sanctified it's faith in the blood of jesus christ it's faith in that not faith in yourself you're not looking at yourself of what you can do or can i read this or can i quit this and you know ten days without cigarettes and five days without looking at that on the internet this is not this is not self-reformation people with strong constitutions brotherhood tells the cis and the message perfection sometimes there's people with strong morale constitutions they can quit doing those things but that is not what we're talking about we're talking about the sanctifying power in the blood to look to the lord and say i've got this in my life lord but i'm asking you lord to cleanse that lord and i know that in that one all-sufficient offering there lays authority and power and cleansing to set me free it's applying the blood are you with me you women he says you had to let your hair grow out lengthen your dresses and act like different than you was it's sanctifying time many times they'd rebel and go back well that's not a child of god a child of god looks straight to calvary and knows that it's for his good what jesus endured for what the joy that was sent before him amen and brethren goes on he says now then that process of time there's where the great falling away come in israel when the great crowding in time people begin to fall away from one side to the other then in their chatting when we wish we were back down in egypt ourselves loathe this light bread in other words if i could take it historically now that's what they said now in the modern day it would be oh every wednesday night prayer meeting every sunday morning back to church what do we hear the same thing the preacher stands up and preached and songs and gone back see then you're just going as a line of duty you're not a worshiper a worshiper goes there to worship to express his self before his god to praise god for his goodness to every word he hangs on to it let me just preach and speak to speak a few moments here sometimes i'll say it like this you know it's just like maybe i heard brother brian tonight i thought it was i thought it was wisdom of what was spoken as i was sitting back there that sometimes there's things you can pick that up then maybe there's things that people are kind of heavy in a congregation but i thought it was wisdom to say hey let's look to calvary because you know what every one of us come in heavy times every one of us come in times that we're down but you know there's a place that we can look to there's sometimes when you started the morning you maybe were not planning on this evening that you felt down or you felt this but let me just say to you like this this is where real overcoming and victory takes place it's even when you don't feel like worshiping there's something in your heart that says he is worthy it's not something that the song leader has to do i think that was wisdom of what brother brother brian did he took and he pointed your hearts to calvary to show you that victory to encourage you [Music] i mean you know if you're not doing it you already know you're not doing it but you need encouraged in it once you do it it's encouraging you to overcome amen and i know that's not something that well it's not real deep but it's something that's very practical it's things that we must do it's we're living in a time where we must override our feelings we're living in a time where we cannot you can't walk by your feelings we've got to walk by faith well the atmosphere don't feel right we'll be part and create the right atmosphere let it be a challenge that where the challenge was at and hear the lord and man this is rough you know brother brian's out of key he got this one too high or this one or one even more and we've all been there and we've all done that it's just your voice ain't up here behind this perhaps some aren't the on key at any time but you understand what i'm talking about every one of us you have we have in those times but this right here we're not coming here as a line of duty i'm not here because i'm admonished by the scripture or admonished by brother branham i'm coming here because i love the lord amen [Applause] it's just like a love affair he says if you was going with the girl because you knew it was duty or you go with the boy but you know mama wants me to go with this guy but i just can't stand him you don't get nothing of him coming to see you or it's the same way about the girl the boy the boy to the girl you go with her she bores you mama wants you to go with her because she's the type of girl that mama likes see it bores you there's no love affair but you don't care you don't want to clean up you don't want to go see her oh boy well that's a horrible thing when he's coming to see you you just wish he'd hurry on and go home he said that's the way it is why does he preach so long what about all this stuff and everything see you're not in love brother sister this is the real culprit this is the reason of falling away this is the reason where lives are up and down and in and out they're not in love with jesus christ if you ever fall in love with him that's it amen if you're just in love with an emotion there'll be times you don't feel emotional there'll be services that maybe aren't swinging from the chandeliers i like all of that but there's going to be times when that word is coming and god is breaking some things and then it's a real test not of wow you know i wonder what the service was like today i wonder why it wasn't like this god's not interested in in in in duplicating a previous service or this service the whole thing in every service he wants to be worshipped powerful things took place on the sabbath stretch out by hand it's simple obedience to the word amen how many times were lives then even after the word has gone forth it's the effect of the word that has been believed and obeyed and remember the angel of the lord still visits neighborhoods of believers oh my it's a difference between a love affair and a law and you know he says but when you really begin to hang on to every word the spirit gave you he said as a warning this morning hanging on to every word that might be what he was talking about holding on its eternal life every word of god it's a joy to go to church under any circumstance mask or no mask you see friends a lot of things even itself it shows up it shows up a lot of the childness the immaturity i might be spanking but it shows up these things well i don't feel this way i think this way and i don't think this way that's childishness it's a joy to go to the house of god under any circumstances at least that's what my holy ghost did for me i mean your druggist may have altered the prescription on you but i got the full intoxicating portion [Applause] whether it's hot usually is here cold indifferent whether the people are fussing oh lord growling not here lord whatever they're doing it's still a joy to hear the word of the lord it just depends on what your focus is you're in love then with the pastor no don't say that then you're in love with brother brown don't say that then you're in love with the bible don't say that it says then you're in love with christ you love to go to church [Applause] the king being in love with christ well honey you know here sunday morning again i i guess we have to wash up the youngins and get down there my it's boresome see you're not in love but if you're really in love you can't wait till sunday morning comes you've just got to get down there with them and the people of god they don't bore you they're brothers and sisters well brother samuel i don't see no movement i don't see this well you know what there is a cure for that criticalness it's called the holy ghost and if you've got a little dry in a little part where your leaves have turned into stickers there is a fountain that is open in the house of david come on friends criticalness does not produce growth it does not invite the holy ghost in the service to work with the lives of people criticalness is not an attribute of being yoked with the holy ghost man where'd this come from somebody must stuck something on my notes here but notice how with israel remember israel god was feeding them manna from hannah hannah and hope from heaven and it became burdensome to him this bread it become brother brown goes on to say it became burdensome this old light bread well what do we care about this old light bread our souls load this stuff everything's wrong this old manner that falls every night we'd rather have some garlic and leek out of egypt let me just tell you something i can say this and i believe i can speak to hearts that have also crossed over i can speak to life that's on the way even when i was in journey into the promise i didn't want to go back to garlic and leaks i didn't want to go back to the things of the world i have been relieved of those burdens i didn't want to go back there no more so what do we do go on amen take the manner that's falling to death go out and get it you receive strength and go on what is the manner it's a type of the bread of life it's a time of the holy ghost calling with the holy ghost as he's falling in the service go out and get it go out and get it say thank you lord jesus take it into your life there's a refilling of the holy spirit said see their hearts wasn't ready for the journey when one man or woman begins to complain about going to church and they get so tired of going to church they're not ready for the journey there's something wrong somewhere he says you're getting ready for the journey and i want you to watch how he brings us down here he says you're getting ready for the journey you're ready to go in the promised land the testing time and but there is the danger ground the wilderness the testing times israel in their testing time they got the quarreling and fussing and loathing over the bread they wanted to go back to egypt they started complaining brother brown goes into that they're complaining about moses and you know is he leading us right and so forth and he goes on to say that but if you at the very end of that but if you're really determined to stay on the road stay right with this leader of the holy spirit stay right with the word if you stay with the spirit it'll keep you in the word it'll take you right down along the line the path of the word don't be afraid of it it won't hurt nothing it'll just help you if you are hurt it heals all the hurts the holy spirit will you can't have two different yokes at the same time you can't be yoked to god and yoke to the world matter of fact god you can't god will not even place the yoke upon you when you're still yoked with the world but it is god's desire to bring us it's a sovereign work of the holy spirit you see that never leaves our lives it's god sovereignly working in our life just as he would say uh you know when he would speak there through paul to the corinthian church and he would say be you not unequally yoked with unbelievers in all through that scripture what fellowship has the temple of god with that of of the children of belong the very the simple part is is that when god is working in your life and i don't even care if you're a person you know maybe you say well i've crossed on over into the promised land but remember when it is in an atmosphere where your faith is stirred to take a promise and believe it but remember words create atmospheres there's things out there that you can become wrapped up in that creates an atmosphere within you that instead of that seed word coming to past in your life it takes away it diminishes what god has called you to remember that's why i don't think anybody here i i you know i can always remember i mean it's even now not just when i was working there's times here i come out of the office and you know it might be a time where the inspiration of god has just come down and it's one of those times where it's just the floods are open and they're just trying to capture i don't want to go nowhere even after capturing it hours later walking out i don't want to go nowhere i just don't want to go i don't want to go and see all those sights and see all those things and be around and those other i just don't want to do it sometimes we have to do that there's things where you get up tomorrow morning and here you know after a service you don't you don't necessarily want to maybe go into a certain environment you don't know what that environment is going to be why because you sense that and when you go into it it's not something you're willfully doing but you recognize say god let the word that i have received lord i don't want it taken out of my life you see it's not the same as if you leave out of here and you go right back with worldly friends or you go over to you know the aunt and uncle's house that every other word it's a swear word and you know one thing starts from running down the boss then they start running down their uncle then they start running down the hat then when you leave they run you down and then you know that spirit gets on you and you want to start running everybody else down very simple but you see the simplicity we're wanting god to do things but yet god asks of us how serious are you and he says come out from among them oh god take me out from among them god said you come out from among them what is it it's faith in his word and this is his promise he says and touch not the unclean faith you know what's unclean you know what you need to separate from how do i do that by faith in the blood of jesus christ and the promise is i will be a father unto you you will be my son you'll be my daughter i will walk in you that's his promise yes jesus also spoke of this yoke when he said that any man that will follow me let him deny himself take up his cross and follow me now when we think of a yoke you know a yoke probably most of you have an image in your mind you've probably seen it whether it's children's books or whatever more sometimes it's wooden and you know like i said for us we don't see a lot of this when we go out you know you know within the uh communities and things like that that were around even among the amish when we would go down there i don't see uh much oxen around at all i see like the big draft horses that they'll have out there pooling the plow and things like that and they're harnessed up but a yoke itself when a yoke would be placed upon this uh this oxen in order for that yolk because of being wood and and so forth the the it is so built to where when the oxen will begin to go forward that the that it will actually move right into position but between that of the ox and that of the yoke there is a lining that goes in there and that lining is what is known as swaddling cloth it's that which actually it works to protect the oxen and to uh make it so that the yoke itself that it is uh you know harnessed by that the yoke itself it doesn't chafe it or you know bring a disturbance upon its neck or you know and and hinder it from accomplishing what it needs to accomplish let me just say it like this the burden you bear is to do the burden you of he god is building you to bear his burden and that's the changing of your nature it's actually it's actually it's not listen to me now it's very simple it's not just lord we forgive me of this you confess all your sin but it's not just removing sin he's relieving the burden of the nature that is in opposition that's where forgiveness comes to a greater depth are you with me because a person can be forgiven but yet what was in them that made them do those things is still there but god's desire is to remove what made those attributes or those things god wants to remove that no person can do that i'm gonna try this in my life it's faith you see who's the one who's lifted up he's the one who's lifted up it's not what i stopped i hope you understand what i'm saying when i say it's not what i stop what you stop it doesn't mean that we sent around and you know here it was we were just like this and said well you know lord you just go ahead and take it lord i'm just waiting i'm just yielded that's not yielded no amen he said come unto me he said take my yoke upon you he's offering it we have to take it amen but you see what faith does faith is eyesight faith is vision faith sees victory faith says you know what he rose he triumphed over principalities over every power the grave couldn't hold him think about it the greatest paradox took place on that easter morning and he demonstrated to you and i this is the power of my resurrection it's the power that i paid the price so i could come and release that back into your life hallelujah god is not coming and he hasn't come to repair our fallen character he comes to do away with that so somebody can look at you and say oh yeah oh you're so-and-so but that's how i remember when you did this in high school oh yeah i remember when you did this but what they fail to recognize is that which was on the inside that nature that life that was there that is no longer there god didn't come in and beat it out of us or you know pull on us or yank us remember it's sovereign love working in our life by his divine power then our will might be surrendered to him the bible says and i want to just just move in these last few points here from this i tell you brother and sister we in this age and in this time we were in a mess i just say it like this i i recognize more and more every day as i just thank god god and you see the reality the purpose of the message we were in a mess we were in confusion you know what babylon is confusion you know what confusion is you don't know where you're standing you can i can talk to some that would be of distant of a kin and the confusion that they would have is they look and they see lives that have left the church i'm talking about in their organizations they left the church and and they're looking at their lives and saying but but so-and-so spoke in tongues i know they had the holy ghost and they spoke in tongues so and so prophesy let me just tell you something my heart i rejoice for the truth that god's brought because it has brought such clarity you recognize brother and sister the holy ghost is the spirit of truth he bears record of the truth he said i am the truth the life and the way. truth is not an idea truth is a person and the confusion is is well i sing i seem to speak in tongues or i sing this or i've seen so and so preaching i don't understand what happened to their life or what became of their life you see god had to bring clarity in this hour that our faith would be based and built upon the world for rapture amen [Applause] god committed listen to me god committed himself when he makes a promise in his word he said behold i will send elijah unto you god made a promise in his word in revelations 10 7 that he himself would descend he would take the sails off the book where man had sealed up the presence of god and the real baptism of the holy ghost god said i will come when god gives his word he is wrapped and tied and obligated to that word [Applause] hallelujah we didn't open our eyes god has opened our eyes and the opening of our eyes it stings at first it's got to bring conviction are you with me you don't get nowhere without confession confession is true repentance the word says this is wrong you say that's wrong lord i want to be lying with your word that's true repentance lord i'm weak in this hair in my life come on let's balance it in the word let the weak say i am strong let him who feels down say i can do all things through christ who strengtheneth me amen are you with me tonight these are promises you have access to even before being filled with the holy ghost you've got to have a promise and a word to stand on to approach the holy ghost the holy ghost is a person it takes the word to build faith in the person of the word himself let me just try to bring this together here this god brings this to you and i and the prophet would take multiple services and preach from ezekiel 36 impersonation of christianity if you ever listen that message it'd be good why is it some christians find it so hard to live a christian life this is the titles of the message but he's bringing this from this scripture you see listen to me now god does not go up and send a message to condemn amen that's not why the preaching of the word it doesn't come to condemn if you took even the first part of the message and said oh my he's preaching on me remember no no don't take it that way recognize and say god that's what i want to be i want to be lined up like that god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world condemnation comes when those reject it but for those who receive it liberty comes notice here ezekiel 36 this is the whole journey of the birth it's god working in your life to justify you justify you are free you are clear in believing amen he rose for your justification notice in verse 26 if i don't read it we won't get to it a new heart also will i give you this is a work of the holy ghost this is why paul says we are his workmanship you're not here the the the uh edition of a church it's his working right he said i'll give you a new heart i'll give you a new spirit a a new spirit will i put within you now you might say well ezekiel's a prophet he's preaching to israel when they're an exile remember a prophet is an eagle as we took a little pause here on a couple weeks here in the midst of that series we're looking at remember a prophet is one who is picked up ezekiel was not seeing the day he was living in ezekiel was seeing our day when hearts would be hardened amen you'll see as we read through this and i will take away so he says i'll give you a a new heart also will i give you and a new spirit will i put within you why do i need a new spirit because you couldn't even get along with yourself see what it is remember he's not wanting to work a contrary to you he's wanting you remember it's our will surrendering to his will so he said i'll give you a new spirit i'll give you a new heart a new heart is a new way of thinking amen before the word just passed you right by a new way of thinking is things that now you look at and say why did i see it before why didn't i say this or when it is what is it new heart who gave you that new heart god did it what's he doing he's preparing to yoke you up it's all a preparation amen just like those amish guys that are down there and um is it mount hope i think it's mount hope on fridays when they do the they bring those race horses in there you know and oh bessie went from eating oats and running the track to she's going to be pulling some things and they're watching these horses they're studying them right they don't just take the horse and all of a sudden put it on a buggy they'll tie it behind the buggy and take it back to their house they want to see how it's going to respond but there's a reason they bought it they believe there's qualities in it those qualities might not all the way be coming out but you take one who knows that horse you or i could say my that's a pretty one wow that's a nice one whoa that's real shiny and that guy says who in the world is this that's not how you choose a horse you don't choose a church based on how beautiful it is does everybody in the church have are they all astounding everybody got their teeth and everything that's not how you choose a church you choose a church back is the holy ghost present leading us in the way of this hour [Applause] god said i'll take away the stony heart out of your flesh think about it you ever try to sow seed on stone you can't do it remember when we had we built our other other house and we had to go through and take all the stones out of the yard right guess your job that was and then one you know there was great big ones i would have loved if there was great big ones i thought my you know we're going to get the rock hound over here with you know the bobcat and get it out and the one guy came over and he said those are 57s you have to rake those out rick i said are you sure i don't want to rake that whole yard but i had to rank them i tried to get every one of them out but i could you know why because when you go to sow seed seed will not grow on top of those stones it's got to find ground where it can bury and die and bring forth and that's where god himself changes your stony heart where at one point you'd say i really want to go to church or a new spirit says ah i really want to go to church but god comes in and he changes your heart he changes your way of thinking he changes your spirit where you're not contrary but he changes that what's he doing he's preparing to yoke us to him look at this verse 27. see many people stop at a new heart in a new spirit this is why the up and down the in and out all over the board friends i'm not saying that to be critical i'm not saying that in regards to people here i'm saying in regards to all throughout even this church this is what i'm responsible for right but so many times this is where we need to go on in verse 27 and i will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them so the lining that we must have the swaddling cloth is that of the holy ghost that's when the word itself we can really be harnessed anybody ever had experienced you know any chafing or hey you know you had chafing on your skin or other things like that maybe chapped lips or maybe you're in the cold when things come up and you you got to keep all that lip balm and everything else or your hands in the winter time you know you're washing what they think about this year what's coming on i mean between the soap and the and the antibacterial stuff or whatever more you might as well just create a bubble and walk around and live in if you do what they say right but what happens with your hands you keep washing them right it's good to have washed hands but after some period of time they start cracking right and you wonder if you're shaking is that flesh i'm shaking brother or is that a leather glove and that's chafing it hurts after a while right shaping sometimes it can hurt maybe there's been sometimes maybe you had a shoe and you know you wanted to be in style don't wear no socks and you get that little blister on your heel it's okay you that doesn't regard whether you're spiritual or not but it's just what god will give me to get a point to you and when after that you're like oh i just sit down while you all go shop i'll sit down while you do this see it's chafing what does chafing do it eventually hurts it stops you from doing what you plan to do a new heart and a new spirit is a wonderful thing but then when the testing time comes and somebody expressed you and say hey i heard that you're making a start for god or i heard you were doing this sir i heard that you were going to this church i heard this right here what did you say well i went up there you know because you know my husband my mom and them invited me and and this and that you say a new heart a new spirit yeah what happens is it's not been fully yoked and the thought of having to answer somebody else i'm just don't you understand this they may not benefit the rest of you but this is from a few weeks ago it's been laying here a chafing where it hurts after a period of time this is this this is let me just say it like this bringing these points together this is why we need the holy spirit god himself to bring the lining to the yoke we need the new heart we need the new spirit but we in all of that is preparation for the fullness of the lining of the holy spirit let me just say what the lining isn't the lining isn't i'm just going to take a summation of quotes here the lining isn't the new heart in the new spirit that'll only last so long new way of thinking about the word a new feeling wow just just feels so good why did god do that so that you could walk up and receive what he has for you that's the holy ghost because you can't go to him if you know you got condemnation on your life the lining isn't emotional that's not what lines it but i'm saying many times people come and they get emotional and then after a period of time they start chafing it starts going away when pressures come hey why are you letting your hair grow out now well um you know um dr um you know dr youtube said that it's the minerals and the nutrients and it is this and is it that i'll tell you what just say it like this god's dealing with my heart right what's happening there faith muscles are growing yes neither is it just the line the lining is in experiences you understand well i'm getting we're playing music up here but it's not just experiences i want you to listen to me now you could take the onrious person or maybe not an ordinary person and they come and set in a service and the holy ghost starts falling maybe as the songs are being played may they just come under and say praise god thank you lord and this and that and and going on and my goodness and the holy spirit falls on them but you see if they don't surrender it's only been an experience without a change and that can bring confusion to a life because they can think i had this experience i had this great feeling i had this great emotion or a person could say maya shouted i don't understand it but you see when the word comes it it does away with confusion and gives clear direction so you recognize it's wonderful to shout we believe in something we believe in entering in but remember it's about a surrendered will amen it's surrendering of our will it's not our works either but that doesn't mean like you see me sitting up here a while ago that my hands are just crossed inside take it from me lord amen dear lord right he's not going to come and wrestle it away the wrestling between jacob and the angel lasted as long as jacob's will when jacob finally released his will then god touched him there there his will his strength finally diminished so the lining isn't the new heart and the new spirit it's not emotion it's not experiences it's not your works we believe in all that right are you with me we believe in all that you understand but the lining is this is what the lining is it's feathers of love is the words of the prophet it's the love of god in our heart it's not us doing it out of a fear amen it's the love of god it's not us trying to say well i know i need to stop cutting my hair i know i need to you know i need i need to stop wearing my shorts or i need something all of that is part of the new heart and the new spirit and you're looking to god but remember don't just rest in yourself you rest in him and say lord i take what you've said in your word i accept this and i walk forward lord with this so the lining is the love of god it is joy it's peace and it's sweetness in the holy ghost it is the power of god in you performing amen it's where we cease that's what the rest of god is it's where we cease and god steps in and it also is to be filled with hallelujahs the yoke brother brown would say like this let me just move through this here what used to chafe what used to chafe no longer chafes people can say whatever they want to say about you remember the bible says when you became companions as paul would said with those who are so used those as you begin walking in the way you endured a great flight a great flight of afflictions reproach comes your way what is that testing time now listen to me you see i don't believe i'm speaking to people tonight i'm just going to take this and i believe this i'm not speaking to people tonight and if anything the holy spirit would warn if anybody has been here for years and you're living in that condition don't keep going that way because just having a cleaned up life doesn't mean you're full of the holy ghost the holy ghost is the love of god in your life and if you've got to tell somebody you're a christian if you've got to announce it then you don't have the speaker on the inside it ought to be the love of god in your life that there's no question who's first in your life if there's going to be a question you might say well samuel you mean at times we don't get down or times we do this sometimes i think we're calling things in the wrong way we're looking at things saying well i just get down or i just do this a little bit or i just do this a little bit friends we've got to be honest with ourselves we're at the door between time and eternity we cannot keep playing around we can't keep looking at it and making excuses for a lackluster life we've got to say god fill me with the holy ghost let the love of god come into my life amen where it's a love affair it's not something you're doing out of a duty or if i don't do this god's gonna get me if i don't do this you're living in a slave mentality that's a state of fear perfect love cast out fear that's what the lining of the holy ghost does it's the internal part that keeps everything on time like the great wheels you know watch he said i'll put my spirit in you it's no longer what you have to do it's the love of god at one time you did what you did because i'm supposed to do this and this is what i want to do and i want to say it like this it's wonderful to have the new heart and new spirit and to have that where you're saying lord i want to line up with your word what do i keep doing take the admonition of the holy spirit he's admonish you keep walking keep yielding and keep applying that word with the objective lord i want my life to be filled with you i want to be yoked with the word i don't want to just carry it under my arm but i want to be united with you lord where it's the love of god on the inside you're not doing it because it's a law but his own nature has wrote his word in your life it's not you struggling it's not you doing it you're trying to bring it to pass but it's good inside of you let me just tell you he's with you hallelujah you take the word and you apply it in your life and when something comes by your way oh oh you're looking like an old grandma or you're this or you're that oh you think now let me just tell you something if you're thinking that oh brother samuel i've got the holy ghost you're just preaching to people that don't have the holy ghost you're missing a great part of this service because it still takes the same application of the word it takes us to recognize that we need our we need him every step of the way it's just like this when you take a promise of god you're born again filled with the spirit of god and you take a promise of god maybe god has spoken to you and said i've healed you and you stand upon that word and somebody else maybe a next of kin can say really why are you still coughing that way why are you still feeling that way why is this still going on but you see you're not taking their word it's not based on your emotions it's based on thus saith the lord he puts the feathers on the cross somebody can say something about you something can happen in the church people in the job or whatever but you'll pack that burden to calvary he said my yoke is easy my yoke is easy my yoke is easy and my burden is light before his spirit comes in the burden can seem very great you'll feel the pressures that can come around you but when his life has come it doesn't mean that you don't feel the burden it doesn't mean that at times that if family or others come around and they say something it doesn't mean that there won't come a heaviness or things around you but the difference is you've got a place to take it to you've got a place where you can take the burdens and that's the calvary brother brown would always use this in every one of these parts where he deals with this where i've just referenced here in the last few moments and you always tie it right back in to samson you know brother branham would zero us in because you know children's bibles and whatever more they got sampson being some like arnold schwarzenegger just some big muscular guy and just and the prophet of god would come and say regarding samson [Music] he was a curly-headed little shrimp mama's boy i don't feel bad now no i ain't shrimp i've never been a shrimp but he said brother samuel why why would that be important to put out there because it was not the natural strength [Music] as a matter of fact if you look even somebody who would have natural strength that's still a paradox to be able to smite that many philistines that's still a paradox but then you take a curly-headed little shrimp [Music] it really becomes even more of a paradox because you can look at that and say that guy don't have anything naturally that you could look like he could whoop one philistine but you see the scripture tells us what samson's strength was the bible says the spirit of the lord came upon him [Music] that's the strength of israel that's the strength of our life that's the strength of the church is the holy ghost [Music] that's where samson brother brown would take this example and say it's like samson when they tried to gate him in there in in gaza he packed up the gates of that city and took the gates and carried them off this is what when things come your way tests come your way this is the blessedness this is where is no it's not a thought about deserting it's not a thought about oh my what have i gotten into oh no so-and-so is going to say this oh no what i'm trying to say to you there's witnesses all around not just me but there's witnesses all around here and you're going to be a witness too of what it is to say i know his burden is light [Music] to where when they would come to you brother brown would say they'll come and they would say hey how come you're not smoking no more how come you're not doing this no more you see when god is so dealing and so moving in their life having the right of way it's come to a place to be able to set down in that life then their answer comes i found a treasure not about not talking about what you gave up or what went out of your life but you talk about the treasure that you found because that's what it's been about that's who it is that's who our life that's what it's about it's about him this is what it really is to be yoked with christ because the truth of the matter is the surrendering of our will makes way for him to come in and live his life through us who's doing this he is he is i don't just believe that i know he's here i know he's here and i say this tonight and as we but go into prayer think of what the blood of what the blood of jesus has done on your behalf [Music] it paid the sin debt as long as the blood was sealed up in that body guilt was still over the human race nobody could go free in the right way but when that blood cell was broken there was a voice that came forth out of that blood [Music] to proclaim liberty and our lord jesus went to the cross and he said the final words three words it is finished [Music] this is what he comes to do finish what he started you never gave yourself i never gave myself a new heart a new spirit we didn't do that but he did we yielded and god began to work in our life so they're saying i feel different i feel lighter i feel you know even the word i don't i can't say i understand everything what do i do keep walking with god when i say walking with god walk with that vision and that purpose to know that the god who tapped you on the shoulder the god who's dealt and removed a stony heart and put in a heart of flesh gave you a new spirit that is all so that he might put his spirit in you that's the objective then you become yoked with christ let's pray anybody like to be remembered in prayer tonight amen as we go to the lord in prayer god bless you god bless your hands heavenly father lord jesus this is the greatest greatest desire it's the greatest delight of our life it's what real joy is is being yoked with you lord lord through the foolishness of preaching you chose to save lord your god to take and to speak to our hearts in such a personal way lord i know tonight i'm not only speaking to hearts that lord is your you're wooing to their hearts lord into a real depth in their life lord you're the one who's wooing you're the one who's drawing but i also believe lord in our hearts that lord is around this congregation tonight the lord you're wooing our lives in our hearts your wooing hearts that lord that whether here over the internet will archive the service that maybe lord they've been maybe they've been around church for years good people fine people [Music] the lord they need the holy ghost now i pray lord may they recognize your goodness to them [Music] lord there's in our lives even for those of us lord that has been sealed been yoked with you lord sometimes there's been things lord we need a refilling of the holy ghost jude would admonish us by the spirit of god say keep yourself in the love of god praying in the holy ghost your prophet would
