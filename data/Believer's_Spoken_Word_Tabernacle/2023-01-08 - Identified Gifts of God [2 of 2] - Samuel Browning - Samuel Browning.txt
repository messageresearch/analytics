know God's mindful of every need God doesn't rank our needs and say this one's less important but I'm glad with him every need he looks at it just the same way because he never made any any special differentiation he just said I'm the Lord that healeth all done diseases I'll take care of it all I don't need to name him I just I'm above it all and I take care of it all so let's just let's just

so Lord we lift our brother up and Lord every other request that's here this morning Lord Lord you see Lord in our bodies Lord some are not with us Lord some are returning Lord and just the Lord

accomplished all that needs to be accomplished May our faith Lord just rise in that place as we just give ourselves to you this morning Lord minister to every need we pray father help us to each and every one step aside and out of the way in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen don't you love him and so good to be in the house of the Lord once again and it's good to see each one of you and um it really is because sometimes we go through things you know and we're we're out and we're in different uh you know when you get into this time of the year there might be certain things that we look forward to in this time of the year but sickness is not one of them and um you know it's just one of those things sometimes that God brings things back to your mind and you know as you maybe don't feel as well and you know you start thinking about other needs you've been praying for a request that have been continually made known you say oh my Lord move for that move for that situation or move for that need you know and you know God God brings us into those times those are little reminders you know I don't know how how you feel you know but uh you know it's it's funny I was talking to my wife about this and you know just from some weeks back and I said you know when you when you get this it's odd because you go from feeling well to where you're battling whether it's sinus or whatever and I said you thoughts start coming in your mind like wow what was it like to feel uh completely you know where you're not walking around and you know you know what I mean talking funny and everything you start thinking like that and you're you know your sleep and everything's broke up but it's in those it's amazing how just in that moment of time we think we think in that way and I tell you what I I believe that's only just a little bit of what really when that life has entered into our hearts there's a groaning there's a release that life to witnesses that there's a there's a landing on the river amen there's something more real you know and uh it just it caused us many times just to go into prayer you know for others and we see those needs and I just as you're turning into scriptures to Matthew chapter 2. um I just ask you just to if you just just bring praying in your heart for me this morning I really didn't last night I don't feel bad or nothing like that it's just sometimes Saturday nights are always sometimes a little rough and it was just a little bit um and more different and I know I'm speaking to others too that no doubt didn't get any sleep or rest as well so may God just help us together this morning amen what it is I don't want to get in the way that's always my that's always my desire I don't want to be in the way um remember the meetings next weekend with brother Trevor Edmond on Sunday um the regular service in the morning and then the youth service in the in the afternoon there at five and uh you know everything we look at the weather I tried to look at the weather um you know and really I don't like to do any too much of anything in January here in Ohio um but um you know brother Trevor was going to be up this area any household we just wanted to go ahead and do it so look we'll keep a look on that and and uh like just like when brother Wayne was here I think the first part of November and you know even the older ones you you came and you helped and you pulled on the on the gift of God and we're just expecting amen great things from the Lord Amen brother Trevor was here with us last last January and brother Trevor just has a wonderful Ministry really has worked really right down there at brother Nathan Bryant's with the young people but in the youth camps uh to me just brother brother Trevor is just a tremendous tremendous brother and just has a to me a real precious gift with even with the young people so amen let's just let's just pray about that will you do that amen now how many are going to pray for me when I preach this morning okay I run needed Matthew chapter 2 verse 9 only a few verses will let you be seated the scripture said when they had heard the king they departed and lulled the star which they saw in the east went before them till it came and stood over where the young child was and when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy remember that star it had it was already leading them supernaturally and when they went to Jerusalem well the star went out there wasn't they even in Jerusalem they didn't know what was taking place but you see God was guiding and directing the wise men the Magi he was guiding them and they had been on a two-year journey and God was directing them a man to this place and so when they leave Jerusalem here they they see the star once again and begin to Rejoice verse 11. and when they were coming to the house they saw the young child with Mary his mother and fell down and worshiped him and when they had opened their Treasures they presented unto him gifts gold and frankincense and myrrh being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod they departed into their own country another way amen may God bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I just um really with just some time here from back in the first part of December just some things that the Lord was just relay just dealing with my heart and a lot of groupings of messages that I've been listening to and just really you know sometimes it's uh you just are looking always in all times looking to God that the Lord would help you to be able to convey the things that he's inspiring and and putting forth in that moment and I want to just speak here just for a few moments on identified gifts of God identified gifts of God and I think that when we are looking at this I want you to hold something in your heart here then I want to just say that as as a believer we are equipped to identify to fulfill and to display the word of God we are equipped for that for that very purpose and I say that as we look at God's divine orchestration within everything and we think of we think of gifts the Bible would say regarding gifts it would say that gifts and callings are without repentance we we realize that repentance itself doesn't even bring the gift even if a person is a preacher or song it's already in them it's without repentance and so we understand that that that can be present there and that's the same way it is with the real gift of God that we want to speak of here is that even of our soul which is the attribute of almighty God that's what the prophet would identify in things that are to be says that's the real gift is that soul that come from God because it's that part that what the quickening power has come in order to Quicken and make alive it becomes a place that Christ himself can reflect his own life and his glory through and that's what we desire in our life there's something there's a longing there's a drawing there's a desire within our hearts and you know sometimes we desire well when many times we want to convey or have our thoughts conveyed and I'm sure probably you're like me many times I sometimes I feel like well I don't have the words to say what I'm thinking or how to put all this together and I'm not just talking about ministering but sometimes when you're trying to express something but I'm glad that God looks deeper than what words or words we can or cannot come up with but God looks down into our heart I always think about that little boy who was praying you know and the guy walked by the field and said all you're saying is your ABCs and he says well he said I I don't know exactly what to say he said but I figure if I send up the alphabet he'll know he'll know what words by looking at my heart and and that's how we feel we we come into times even in prayer and other times and I'll just say many times Lord I know what's on my heart but I don't even know how to articulate and I'm glad that God you know God's not about the these and the vows I appreciate you know the King James Bible but God is not asking us to be a V and a thou and that we've got every word just right I think like brother Branham talked about when he went to pray you know when brother Brahm said I didn't even know how to approach him so he wrote a letter dear sir and you know the reality of approaching God it's just that simple we don't have to put on any vernacular or try to put something on or you know well I can quote this and quote just just talk to him like you talked to your buddy I I we understand there's a right approach we understand and that's a reverence we're coming to him that he knows just what we have need of and we can speak to him in a relationship we're not strangers we're not foreigners he is our friend amen we are his children we are his offspring so I believe with all of my heart that these are things that sometimes that what we cannot articulate but yet our thoughts will will be expressed and so when you think about our thoughts and trying to formulate or trying to even describe of what Jesus Christ would mean to you and I and and what it would mean to us even in this moment even thinking about the wise men as they were on their Journey you remember that here on that Journey when they saw supernaturally that star and you know it's the same God who led the children of Israel and God knew well the rest to everybody else it passed over observatories it it passed right through and let's just say for example in that hour they might have had a Life magazine that would have taken a picture of it but and people could have you know awed about it but it didn't have the same significance for everybody else it didn't have the same meaning it didn't have the same holder or the same pool or the same draw but but to these men it was something different when they saw the unusual and the phenomenon they were directed right back to the writings how did God will move in our lives to direct us back to the word the Bible said he'll bring all things back to our remembrance and how that they were drawn back to that place of knowing that there was a man Among Us by the name of Daniel now they didn't live in the time of Daniel but there was that that how that God had kept that word alive right there in the court and they would go back to that and there was that event and they could see that is what was spoken the scripture a star shall arise out of Jacob and they were moving under that under that direction and it was something that moved in their heart upon the gifts and what they were to bring in that time you know God didn't have to tell them as far as to come down and say you bring this and you bring that that no more than he had to do that and when it came to building the Tabernacle in the wilderness God never had to tell them you give the black onyx stones and you give the goat hair and and you give the blue and and you give the red God didn't have to tell him the only thing that happened was is when the vision could be made known then through that Vision being opened the inspiration would strike the hearts of the people and they would begin to release what they had in their treasures and you know the tremendous thing about it is they didn't have to go get something they only had to release what was already in their possession glory be to God oh my think about this how brother Banner would place it in this way he said the things that we bring to him identifies what our thoughts is about him he said if you believe it with all your heart every word of it you'll identify it by giving all that you have to it but if you believe it's a good place to associate with better people around church and things like that then you know just a few social hours with the congregation or something but if you believe it with all your heart how many believe with all their heart if you believe with all your heart then you give everything that's in you to it and it identifies you that you truly believe the message that you believe it to be the truth now you know brother Brandon goes into this how some people can say I can only believe this much or I can only believe this much and he begins to break that down between you know and referring back to the message that he's preached just some time ago on Believers make Believers and unbelievers and and to recognize that you know that not one person or in that category can help or change or be something different than than they already are but but to a Believer there's something that longs for God uh you know it's just one of those things that it's not ever comes to its place for a believer that says I've had enough but there's something with a believer that says I want more now there's sometimes where there's things that we in our Humanity can allow other things to get in the way but as a Believer we can never be satisfied when we allow the world to get between us and God it'll never satisfy something's just not right you it doesn't feel right it's just not right and then you know they say what do we have to do we'll step right out of Jerusalem and just start looking for the star again because the same God that has guided you this far he's here to guide you the rest of the way and these gifts that they had in that hour it was these gifts were so fitting they were just exactly that would describe the very the very one who was upon Earth in that time the deity being that of his own life it was God that was tabernacled in his creation it was that of Frankincense which would be that of service unto the the word of God unto almighty God Jehovah's servant and it would be murdered that it would be that of a of death and a dying and to bring a ransom for you and I and to bring Redemption and this is why when brother Brandon would point this out and it's so it's so important because Satan hates this Revelation that God and Christ are one he hates that Revelation because his desire the reason he hates that is because God in Christ are becoming one and that being manifest it is a a signal to the believer that this is my portion oh my like David said our lines have fallen in Pleasant places this is my portion that's what belongs to me what is it it's God's own life God and Christ are one amen this is why when we look at the scripture brother random would say Jesus was God in the form of man I want you to listen to this statement now he said he wasn't nothing less than God he was God manifested in flesh he was the creator in his own creation and then he repeats in about a few two or three times listen this he was the creator in his creation by the creation for the creation he was the creator in his creation by his creation for his creation it all comes back to God in the whole thing he was the cree Creator in so much that he was God he was a being on earth a being of time which would mean that he must have had a beginning therefore he created himself a body to live in Mary never produced that nobody else produced that you you say what are we saying well look what we want to say is what God was saying with what he did God was letting us know that I don't need you to produce anything but I already have provided for myself and the only thing I need you to do is just release to me when you recognize me just release what I've already placed in you glory be to God we didn't bring this about thank God for Sunday school thank God for the message of the hour being played in our homes thank God for devotion thank God for all of that but that is not what has brought this about in our life as far as the deposit of that seed we were always Sons and Daughters of God whether you were in Sunday school or you weren't in Sunday School some of us didn't have the choice of the backgrounds that we come from but oh now how thankful we are for the grace of God that has found us and brought us to himself therefore he created himself a body to live in God himself created a body for himself that by his creation he might save the Lost creation that he had created so the body of Jesus Christ is the building and Tabernacle of the Living God remember when Paul was on the road to Damascus and hear the light hear the pillar fire showed up he who are you Lord he said I'm Jesus who you persecute we know that he had already the death burial Ascension and the Holy Ghost had come back the same life that was there dwelling in that body the same God was now dwelling in a body of Believers that he had redeemed and assembled together remember when Jesus said Upon This Rock I will build my church so the Church of the Living God is the building and the Tabernacle of God that is built by divine revelation as a matter of fact the whole coming of the Lord Jesus was was purposed for Redemption he is the savior of the body is that right Peter would describe it like this that we are Lively stones that are built up a spiritual house Paul would say it like this we are building and fitly framed together as a habitation of God through the spirit and how would you want to say it like this it is God that is orchestrated every aspect and the coming to our position he has orchestrated every member to come into its ordained position he's not left that to a man you see even in the vision when brother Brown's communicating of how that God would reveal a vision of this baby is going to be healed or this person even though it was declared in the vision brother Randall could not tell anybody you go sit here put the handkerchief here put the put the glasses there but the same God heal which was which is and which shall come that same God was there and what was it it was God moving in segments of time to bring everything in position the prophet showed us when he went up there to pray for that little baby you know that time he rushed in right away and prayed for the baby and the baby was actually more sick but after he prayed for it what was God showing God wasn't just showing that to the prophet that was showing you and I we still battle with impatience in our life we still battle when we look at our own life or maybe on the lives of others but God was showing you and I and reminding us us you must be patient because whatever I have spoken I will fulfill it in my season and in my time that's the same way with every member of the body same way in every individual aspect in our lives oh God help us to be energized by that every member think about it is ordained every member of the body of Jesus Christ he is ordained in position and guided by the Holy Ghost yeah you know brother Brown will pick this up but science sets it out as well when they can take cells from from embryo cells from an unborn fetus and they'll inject those cells and brother Brandon would pick it up he said of wow he said there's an intelligence that will cause the thyroid cells in that embryo to go to the thyroid and the liver will go to the Livery you see what it is is how it's orchestrated by almighty god brother van would say it like this some intelligence guides those animal cells exactly to the right place that intelligence accepts those cells and puts them in the right place let me just say this the same intelligence that does that in the natural body is the same shall be light glory be to God it's the inspiration of God that moves down in the hour to catch the people of the hour and his seed Not seeds but seed is that right and his seed being that of the royal seed of Christ and that's why the promises God makes known those promises in each time and every generation and this is if I can just refer to it like this this is why with the bride of Jesus Christ brother Brown would say in plain language the bride of Christ was in the mind of God eternally though not expressed until each came forth in the designated decreed season and as each member would come come forth it'd become expressed and took its place in the body and though this pride is the literal spoken word see Bride she is feminine in designation she is also called the body of Christ it's apparent that she ought to be called that because she was predestinated in him she comes from the same Source was eternal with him and is now manifesting God in a many-membered body whereas once God was manifested in one member even our lord Jesus just Christ remember the purpose was is God desired to get back in man that's Fellowship right there God desired to get back into man and that fellowship with man and then through that then restore everything back as it was you know the Bible would say in First Corinthians chapter 12 for the body is one I know we know these scriptures but it's very key here the body is one and hath many members and all the members of that body being many are one body so also is Christ for by one Spirit one intelligence are we baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit all like that so the spirit of God is not we're looking at our class he's not looking at rich or poor he's not looking at your background as far as in this life no he's looking much deeper he's looking to that into that of the depths of what really belongs to him amen so notice for the body is not one member but many so the body I mean you can look just at your body there is every member is diverse I mean you know the hand that looks different than the from the foot and the leg and even the internal organs within the body and yet each one has its distinct purpose you know there's not one member no matter how small or maybe insignificant it cannot say to another member of the body you are not needed or you are insignificant now you know the hand will not understand what the heart does and the heart's not necessarily going to understand you know maybe what my kidneys do or or you know the arm or the muscles or others of the things but each one has its parts you know there's things going on in me and you right now that you don't see but you know his heart's pumping you know his is his lungs aren't working you can tell that right now though you cannot see my lungs or see my heart but yet I am benefiting from them and yet every one every one of our members in the natural is so diverse one from another and that's the same way it is in the body of Jesus Christ sometimes those are some of the biggest Hang-Ups that we have is with the differentiation or the diversity within the members but we must come back and focus on it is the Oneness of Jesus Christ that is working in a many member body amen we are all different and we all have different purposes I mean you can even line up this platform with pastors and every Pastor is going to be different and we're all going to have our own peculiarities as well as here within this congregation and in an understanding that God has said it that way oh my you know uh let me just say it like this sometimes the very things that we are we are trying to get rid of and God is letting you and I know you're not going to get rid of that part about you it's going to bother you until the change of the body but what I have equipped you with is my life so that you might recognize it and and recognize greater is he that's in you that's overcoming right sometimes we're praying and I want this corner I want that gone and I'm talking about the weaknesses or the things that we can look at in our makeups or our temperaments but remember those are opportunities for overcoming so the whole thing is God becoming tangible let me just try to hurry here it's all as as Ephesians would say every one of us is given Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ in Romans 12 3 Paul said I say through the grace given to me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly evidently that's something we had to be reminded of in the back there in the days of Paul they had to be reminded of it and we have to be reminded of it right sometimes not letting this go on as according as God hath dealt to every man The Measure of Faith in Romans 12 6 he's given us gifts differing according to the grace that has given us whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the proportion of Faith so God has dealt to every man a Measure of Faith you know it's just like that when it comes into Israel coming into the land you remember when God is just a beautiful study but when God would actually go through and begin to identify the different tribes of Israel and he there would be characteristics that would be uh about them you know this would be over here but corn and oil and on and on it's just just a beautiful thing maybe God will allow us to take it some time and and bring it down and show it into our own natural lives because if you could take every one of the tribes of Israel and you put a problem before him and you surround every one of them with the 12 tribes you will have 12 different perspectives on how to solve that problem why because they are all unique and there's El different it's diverse there would be certain things that Ephraim would approach him and NASA would approach different Judah would approach it different but you see God himself has so orchestrated and in that way that we need all of those perspectives that are under the leadership of one goal we do not if we got a goal that we start pulling away well I'm better than brother Joy because I see it this way or I'm better than brother then somehow we don't have the right goal somehow there's been a different Spirit that's entered in there and what that spirit is actually causing us to do is to stop and to block what God has called us to do we are a part of the body we are not the body we are a member in the body and God desires to use and move and flow through our lives as we'll yielded to him oh my sometimes the things that can get us hung up on other people is our thoughts about things and what's trying to straighten them out and figure this out and figure that out and in the sand at the same time Satan says gotcha because I've stopped your yielding to the throne of God I've got you looking at this worrying about this and worrying about that oh if we can realize the same intelligence that's dealing with my life Lord help me not to get my mind in things but to let me be under the same intelligence Lord because the same intelligence that is guiding me the same one that guided the wise men is the same one guiding my brother the same one guiding my sister well Mom this is why we cannot take one another's position that's why another brand would even tell us this is why he brought the adoption message that's one of the reasons he said is because how Joshua had divided up the land by divine inspiration coming under that same inspiration he says we always got that one is trying to take the other person's place or one is trying to say if you don't do it like I do it you're doing it wrong of course I'm sure we probably don't deal with that but anyhow they call them micromanagers I think that's what it is right Supernatural inspiration that's exactly what we are are Guided by and to think about when we would come here in this moment these these wise men were Guided by the inspiration of almighty God not only in their Journey but in what they were bringing and brother Brown would ask the question like this he said what are we doing here where do we come from or what business do we got being here we wasn't put here just by chance we were put here for a purpose and we must serve that purpose now can I can I be very clearly if your purpose was to be an art an artist or an art teacher let me guess where you what you'd be doing you're not going to find out the purpose by hanging down after you know at the local McDonald's joint you're going to be going to school for right so in other words in order for those purposes to come out it's got to come into His presence and see God knows that God knows that you or I can never find him he from the beginning has always been the one coming and searching out his children that's exactly right and every time when God makes known the purpose the longer you stay in the prince of God the more overwhelming and the more impossible that the purpose be schemes to be that you and I are called to fulfill but here's the secret if we'll just stay in the presence the same God that's unfolding the purpose is the same God to fulfill it so we want to just look at that here just a moment the Bible says that when these wise men came in Matthew 2 verse 11 I want you to notice when they came and they saw the young child not the baby the young child remember when when those wives when the Shepherds came it was in its infancy is that right but now when the wise men come it's standing on its feet it came as an infant this even this bride was born in infancy the prophet could point out an end time seed sign he said five stars have aligned in the heavens what is it it's an infant church that has been born upon this earth oh my it's the bright body of Jesus Christ but now when you and I as the word is bringing us and moving into that maturity the bride is not an infant the bride is not a toddler this same word that brought this church to a birth my mama it's the same word that's bringing this world into a birth pains this same word is the same word that has brought them a charity within just those few years to say not she will be him but she is him [Music] so it goes from infancy until where the bride is standing upon her feet Amen Let us be glad and rejoice for the marriage of the Lamb has come you don't marry an infant right you you you you you don't you don't do that and that Jesus wasn't going to do that either so it must be a fully matured woman that has come upon the scene by the presence of his life so notice the Bible says that when they fell down now notice when they got here I want you to catch this they have the gifts and those gifts are going to identify him and it's going to identify what they think about him it's also going to identify that truly they did see the supernatural because of what they are yielding and surrendering but before they ever presented their gifts they did something very important they fell down and worshiped you know there's a lot of times they're saying this is a real key there's things that we are Desiring in our life I don't say that there's not one person here that wouldn't say Lord I want more of you I want more of you in my life and we know what that entails that requires us giving more of ourselves and sometimes we can become so mechanical in those things and we fail upon the principle of the way that everything comes about is recognizing his presence and don't make it like as though caught up in the business of Life hurry up come on I gotta get this done come on put this in my life Jesus come on hurry and get this that's not how he works anybody else want to see it like that Lord I guess I'm the only honest one maybe in me and a couple other people right sometimes we want to see things we want to see things so quickly but the key what's the first thing is recognizing his presence what do I do when I get in his presence Fall Down and Worship Him he is worthy notice Revelation 5 when the book is taken what do you see it is a worship of King lamb that breaks out what do you see when it was revealed to the Shepherds it was the god lamb among them and they begin to worship the angels that sang were the morning Stars those same Angels now were singing upon Earth because Redemption what was in God's mind has now come down to the Earth and just so you understand that your life and my life is a song the Bible said when he took the book they sung a new song right and any song everybody knows this you don't just play a song with high notes every song has a mixture of low notes and high notes and even in this journey the new song does not remove the low notes but what it is it's victory in the low notes is victory in the high notes it's victory working when I don't feel like it's working if Victory is still working it's victory that draws me to submit myself it's victory it's a victory of Calvary that's working in my life that brings me to fall down and to worship you see this is a characteristic of the attributes of God all the way from Genesis to Revelations when you think about it Abraham when Abraham recognized this is somebody different I've seen a lot of men pass this way but this is difference Abraham had been in contact with God and Abraham recognized this is Elohim that has come down what did he do he ran out fell down on his face and began to worship him and you know what he told him don't leave we'll make supper for you you know what he's trying to do keep him around right you know how it is you want to seep out of your house don't serve them nothing oh Lord Brother Sammy you just bringing down offenses now right but Abraham said hey I want you staying around I want you to abide here just sit down right here we're gonna we're gonna get a calf and you know dress it and milk and on and on and think about when Moses got into the presence of the Bernie he turned aside to see the burning bush he's seeing this bush is on fire yet it's not consumed and he draws an ear to it and when he gets near God instructs him take off your shoes for the grounds you're standing on his Holy Ground And when God begins to make himself known in that hour and one he is calling Moses to do Moses begins to make it known to God with his stuttering his slow tongue I am not going to be able to do what you are calling me to do but let me just tell you something right now God don't take no for an answer boy that would preach I'll tell you God just don't take no for an answer you know what he's going to do he's going to overwhelm you with his presence the things that you can look I don't know God's just going to overwhelm you with his presence what's he doing our faith is being built not in the enticing words of man's Wisdom our faith is being built in the power of almighty God when Joshua wanted to know how do I take down Jericho he goes out and he meets the captain of the Lord's House he thinks he's a man just like any other ordinary man he draws his sword out and said whose side you're on because if you're on the wrong side your head's coming off right but immediately when he identifies himself I am come now as captain of the Lord's host I come to lead this Army into battle Joshua falls down and worships him you see that's an attribute of a Believer when they recognize they're in the presence of God they'll fall down and begin to worship Him and you know what God's not there say come on present the gifts present the gifts no no he brings us forth first by worship you know I tell his presence draws an ear in prayer it's just to worship Him think about it even in Revelations 1 John falls down I don't have time to to keep going on all those examples but I want to draw you back to this point here that I read some moments ago that God in his creation by his creation for his creation that same deity and you know just as it was rejected then deity was rejected that same deity is rejected and has been rejected all down Through the Ages as a matter of fact when they rejected deity that's when when the Jews finally at that moment and Paul after the presenting even of the Gospel you know of the death bearing resurrection and now the outpouring of the Holy Ghost once the Jews turned that aside but the Gentiles Rejoice God closed the door right there upon the Jews or or breaking away and now going fully into the Gentiles for this time and we know he's getting ready to turn as well back to the Jews but you see it was rejected deity and one is rejected deity you know it's one thing you know to recognize how that God had come down to come and pay the ultimate price but you know now to recognize what all of that was about is so that that same deity might come and live in Tabernacle in our lives and you know the Bible said that even in the day that you and I are living in that they would have a form of godliness there's a big difference between religion and a birth right religion can go on and it's only a covering but there's never really addressing the root and problem and the issue it never brings forth a relationship and this is why brother Brown would say when it comes to accepting deity and expressing back the same kind of a gift like the wise men did you are identified by your gift that you give your entire being to it to identified deity I like that don't you giving our entire being to identify deity then you identify yourself with deity by giving all you are what you are to deity himself so so you're not giving yourself to the man whom deity is displayed through but it is deity you're giving yourself through remember when the Greeks they said we would see Jesus and here Philip brings them to Jesus and all they saw was a man right that's all they saw but Jesus let them know that that there will come a time that that will be revealed or May known the disciples their sight was beyond the flesh because remember faith is not what you see here faith is what you see from here because they recognize even when Peter couldn't even explain it Peter was not even born again yet but there was that part on the inside of Peter which was a gift that was placed in him before her before the foundation of the world his name was on the last book of life and it just was in the prince of God and it just erupted and spoke out at that moment Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God glory be to God hallelujah oh my oh sure Satan tried to discourage Peter and take him away and say look what you've done you've turned away you cursed him you did this you did that but you cannot get away from the calling of God you cannot get away from his purpose the enemy will try to lay all sorts of things on you he'll try to Cloud it up but let me tell you something he cannot hinder nor stop nor prevent the supernatural from coming after every one of God's children he can't do it I don't care all the traps I don't care all the isms he cannot stop God from getting to his children I tell you what is that that's a supernatural intelligence that's an intelligence that looks beyond all my fault and sees my need oh it's the same way with Christ in this day you believe that it's deity among the people that's that's what the message of the hour it was declaring here that's why the message of the hour it's not just not another Ministry it's a message from the Throne of God we're in the end time and now where Christ himself would step in his fullness the full deity of God was on display and it is still on display in a mini-membered body you say that person that person oh no don't judge me about the badger skin the badger skins once held a mean old Badger that Badger skin itself in once hold an animal animalistic man animalistic woman or it was a mean and cantankerous thing but you know what God didn't try to change the badger all God said is I gotta get on the inside if I can take out the nature of that Badger and change it there to the nature of a lamb I'll have a lamb being made manifest through Badgers Millions you'll repeat a god what is it deity on display amen it's the same deity on display and we give ourselves to it freely Lord I give myself to you because that is the only real gift that you and I can give is give ourselves because he already gave himself amen just to give our whole entire selves but I don't want to hold nothing back to you I don't want to hold nothing back I want to give it all to him and we look at all this that was placed in the life you know from the deity the uh the gold and the deity and the frankincense frankincense you know when you read in the scriptures frankincense um frankincense was one of those things that the only way you got frankincense probably some of you done study on this when you get frankincense it's the only way you get it is a tree has to actually be smoked and cut and it is the frankincense that'll run out of the cut it'll ooze out of that and then they'll go back and collect that frankincense and they'll Store It Up in places and allow it you know to just kind of uh you know um you know move into a better uh get into you know that state the hardened State and so forth and and more and more of a useful moment so here you have that of frankincense and to think about it he was wounded for my transgressions rules for my iniquities he made a way so that you and I might receive power for service we wanted to serve God but we needed power for service we needed something greater than our intellect and God provided there through the deity the frankincense and the myrrh and to think about it it just doesn't stand just doesn't happen one time but that deity empowers or places Us in service to serve his purpose which comes forth as we die to ourself and his life flows through Us by his creative Life coming through his creation it's continual dying to ourselves that's continual dying to ourselves this is why the scripture in Romans 12 would say present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service be not conformed to the world but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind that you might prove what is a good and acceptable and perfect will of God I want to just just just put it here in this manner I got this point I got one more point but I want to make this point here it's a continual presentation you realize that the children of Israel the sons of Israel would have to come and present themselves three times a year these to Passover feast of Pentecost I believe and then that Feast of of the of the end Gathering I I think I've got the feast right there but it's it's here when you when you bring it down what it comes down to is Son of Man Son of God Son of David so in all through in every dispensation and all that has been called for down through the Gentile ages it has been the Holy Spirit he that happened here let him hear what the spirit say to the church once you've been doing it's been calling the children of God to present themselves in his presence is that right now notice if there is a continual presentation to take place so it's not just something that we we we do and you know and well we we do and now now we're good to go but it's something there's a longing within us there's a desire there's a yearning to grow I I mean you know how this is with um with children you know uh maybe some more than others but you know they they want they want to kind of progress and do things you know and when it comes time to maybe do the you know get their license well you know if 14 years old don't want to go sit in the truck or sit in the car and he all started up for you after they get their license you'll be starting their car for them I mean it wears off right there's certain things that you you you look at it that when we're always we're looking there's a desire to grow there's a desire and I want more and Lord I I desire more of you and that's why brother Graham said that after in in the message power transformation he said look he said after we have been filled with the Holy Ghost as we have well now we want the mind of Christ to be in us that'll transform us from the Natural Things of life and be brought to do the perfect will of God by the transformation of God's spirit by his word now I know sometimes we can look at it and think well that's a One-Shot deal brother Samuel no it's not a One-Shot deal once we have been born again we have come into the body of Jesus Christ now it's us dying and yielding that the mind of Christ might operate through us and it's us that has to yield it's us that has to give God he's a gentleman he's a husband remember within that the desire is is that we would yield to his leadership because we all know it's our thoughts to get us in trouble right I mean you know you get a pain oh I got a pain here I got a pain there I got a pain here let me go to Dr Google and Dr Google says if you got this if you got that if you go are you feeling like this well you know what I think I am I think I am I you know what I think oh you know you might have oh Lord not the c word oh Lord no oh right what is it what we've entertained well we've come in the presence of and entertained has brought fear if it'll do it that way and that in that manner oh my I pray to God that God's stirring our hearts up that we can say I got to go to Dr Jesus I I got to know he's speaking to my heart he's speaking to my life do you feel like this yes Lord I love you uh do you want to follow my word I do want to follow your word do you want to see more of me I do want to see more of you and what's happening there it's building faith and confidence in him as we continue to present ourselves in his presence the Bible says in Proverbs 18 16 a man's gift maketh room for him and bringeth him before Great Men now think about it it's not the man who does it it's the gift that maketh room and it is the gift that brings him before Great Men so a gift is what a whole gift a gift is about getting ourselves out of the way now we all could agree a pastor that's a gift and the gift is to get itself out of the way that God might Shepherd through that gift not try to be an evangelist or a prophet or whatever no just just do according to how God let God operate and flow through that gift that channel evangelist whatever it might be same way with any of the nine spiritual gifts that are in the body but I want you looking at it you and me to look at this in the manner of a gift maketh room for itself to remember what the real gift is it is the gift of that soul that come from God and the Holy Spirit is what is sent in this earth to draw you and I out and to bring that nature into a Divine expression so every gift maketh room for itself you know think about it brother Rand will talk about this about brother ruddle in the adoption series and he talks about how brother rutle you know brother Ram's telling their brothers he said look he said I got some Churches if y'all if you don't feel like pastoring and so forth and he pretended to begin to talk about you know talking about brother ruddle and he said you know brother ruddle saying oh brother Brandon I can't talk real good and I you know brother goes through it on tape right there and brother remember said you know what brother he said my goodness he said yeah I can't get up there and preach I I can't even talk and brother Brown said have you heard him now brother Adam said it like this he said he was so backward he said I I just can't talk brother Adam brother I said you ought to hear him now you don't know what you can do until you let the Holy Spirit get a hold of you see it's not us telling God what we can do it's God letting you and I know this is what I can do you hear what he said it's not what you can do it's what he can do so that means there's somebody in the way and that's me and a gift is to be able to get ourselves out of the way you know what Joseph I love this in the in the in the message of prisoner of Jesus Christ but the RAM talks about Joseph and how Joseph I mean you know what happened with Joseph where he was you know his uh sold into slavery and he was there in prison and brother Brown begins to talk about in that message of prisoner and be a good message to list two if you haven't in a while but the brand begins to talk about it of how that Joseph was sitting there in the prison and he said how that Joseph became a total failure to himself I want you I want you to take this in context here he became a total failure to himself he was in a situation nobody would listen to him unbelievers would not believe his ministry was of none effect people turned their head wouldn't pay attention to him in prison they'd walk on down the street he said but and God kept him a prisoner until the will got rolled up tight and then God said here's my man says Glory total failure exclamation point see what you and I look at is total failure of just I feel like a failure and the giving up is not throwing in the towel but giving up is his Lord I heard of me trying it's with every aspect in our life and God allows the situations all the crime that Joseph did in prison all the thinking all the overcoming that he had to overcome where his Brethren had threw him in a pit where his Brethren had did all that it was an overcoming for Joseph through all of that and in his thinking he had become a total failure Now watch how brother Brown says this I love this part in the message brother Graham says God came to him in prison like he did Paul like he did the rest of them and God used the gift that he had given him to get him out of there so what was Joseph's ticket out of prison the gift that was in him the whole time the gift that was in him is what God used not Joseph God used it to get him out of there oh you hearing me now it's the gift within your life as a son and daughter of God it's us surrendering to his presence not just for the new birth to come but for every step in phase of our journey it's God using the gift as we can yield as we can surrender what is it it's God using the gift by his Spirit you say what's the gift it's his word it is God using his word in our lives to get us out and one of these days it'll be the final departure because this is a bit this is the worst prison house than the prison that Joseph was in but remember it was in that prison house he became a failure which is very important you can never we can never go any further until we recognize ourselves a failure you know what real maturity is you know you've heard me say this now for years real maturity is not where you come to a place that I don't make mistakes any longer real maturity is not where you or I come to a place to say I don't need to pray as much anymore I don't need to read as much anymore real maturity is not we're all I've got this cover no real maturity is where we recognize our need of him is greater than what we ever recognized before that's what real maturity is that we recognize Lord I need you every step of the way Lord that's what real real maturity is and we don't need more of him no real maturity says I need more of him why we see ourselves as a total failure without him and then we're a prisoner where we can be surrendered to his working and his leading and then when we come into that then we are coming into a place of a ruler where we can come into position now let me just try to move here into a place I want to get to this last Point here real quick and I want to just deal with this I hope this all coming together as he just leading I but I want to talk about that gift just a little bit continuing continual presentation us continuing to present ourselves in his presence a lot of things will try to stop that a lot of things can try to block it we can let things know we can go right through this room and we can all give examples of things to wear things that we've allowed whether it's traps or other things that has come up that's blocked us from getting in his presence now it's not just it's not just coming it's his presence is not just confined right here but his presence is to go with us we can abide in his prayer you can have the busiest day on the job but you can be in his presence you can invite his presence and and just invite him to come in and say Lord I want to abide in your presence and allow him to work on your life you know remember you and I are not the ones determining thyroid cells go to thyroid kidney cells go to kidney cells so you know what that means brother Aaron it isn't you it isn't me Brother Richard it isn't you it is in me brother Bill it isn't you it isn't me saying hey Lord put the word over here Lord put the word over there there are times we do not even know what to say but our thoughts are expressed as we will yield that gift in his presence and say Lord I don't even know exactly what to say or how to say it but Lord God I just want to be in your presence because in your presence is fullness of joy in your presence I am changed from Glory unto Glory so I am here Lord just to present myself once again let me deal with this last one very quickly one of the things that we deal with no matter what stage that we are in in our walk with God is overcoming the intimidation of our inabilities we can be intimidated by our inabilities that doesn't that doesn't cease the new birth doesn't do away with that Humanity part of it but remember depending on where you and I dwell what dog we feed the most what presents and the things we give ourselves to it's either going to build Faith or it's going to build doubt that's all choice and so when I think of it think about brother Branham you know you've heard me refer to this on the midweek services in the message go tell when God is confirming to him the third phase of his ministry the third pool brother Brown has a sinus infection that's real bad medicine can't touch it and so forth brother ram calls it an ash Heap that he was on brothers were coming to pray for him nothing was breaking and finally the Lord spoke to him and brother Brown was talking about this third phase of his ministry and I love how brother Brown was so open before us because what God was calling him to that of that of the spoken word where it would be the revealing of the word coming forth here in our midst that's what would get a hold of Our Lives that's what would change our lives that's what would uh uh divide to us our inheritance because that's our position in the word but you realize on the greatest thing Brother Carlos that's where Satan came to attack him and brother Brown was sitting right there and brother Brahman was was looking at it I don't want to fail I don't want to be a failure I don't want to fail I don't want to be a failure well any any one of us would look at things like that and we still do look at things like that anybody ever had had an impression of the Lord go say this or go speak this or go say this to the brother or go say this to sister and you didn't do it well you don't have to raise your hand but I'll raise your mind right and sometimes we come to a spot finally recognizing you know what instead of wrestling with it I'm just going to do what the impression is said to do I'm gonna I'm gonna move and I'm gonna act upon it because sometimes we're thinking about what are they going to say what the result's going to be and what is this and what is this and we're looking at that what is that it's overcoming the intimidation of our inabilities this is the pest house this is part of overcoming this is an everyday every moment every hour overcoming and brother Branham finally when the Lord spoke to him remember what brother Ram started thinking about he thought about George General Patton and he also thought about uh General Eisenhower and he talked about general you know General Eisenhower I think it was that said hey if I put a bullet in a gun it don't go off gonna take that one out and put another one in if that don't go off take it out put another one in I'm going to keep putting bullets in because it's going to fire and it's going to hit the target now think of it simple natural things when it came to war but the Holy Spirit would pick that up and well as without a general patent telling them when he had men coming to the front line and running Patton said don't send me no more boys up here you send me some men that are willing to fight and the Holy Spirit began to take them examples and then he spoke to the prophet and said I have already confirmed this third pull to you but do you need to accept accept it and you know what brother random lack into two brother Brown likened it to a man that has heard the gospel preached service after service after service year after year after year but finally comes to replace to press beyond the fear of failure and say you know what I'm going to accept what he has said I'm going to accept what God is saying because God isn't asking me to do it it's God asking me to surrender the gift that he might achieve think about the problem when he stood there and here even in the first coming there because when brother Adam accepted it let me go back to the third pool when brother by Adam accepted that he said Lord then I accept it the sinus condition broke the condition broke think about when the angel of the Lord came to brother Branham at first gave him his original commission what did Brother Graham say when he told him you're going to be praying for kings and this and that and whatever but the REM said I told him I would not be able to do that but this ain't like your boss at work I know you might say well you don't know my boss no but I'm telling you Jesus ain't like that but see Jesus Don't Force because Jesus ain't asking us to do it he's asking us yield and let me do it that's listen that's the secret in overcoming in every battle and every trial this is why because I had just a few more moments think of Gideon here's Gideon you know you know we can look through the scriptures and no doubt as Bible readers you look through it and sometimes you see man it looks like one just pow came up overnight pow like a David and pow like this sometimes we forget how long suffering God was and is with us when God's had to correct us of things that we have finally matured into and come to the realization hey this is pretty important I need to be doing this come on Friends we can all look back honestly back down through our lives we can see where God has brought us to think of where Gideon was standing Gideon looked at himself and he's and he's and and when God spoke to him there the angel of the Lord that followed the message Gideon looked around and said a mighty man of Valor Guinea and said who else is here God began to tell him what what he called him to do and Gideon that complex that he had I mean his family had a complex you got the wrong you're talking about Manassas you're talking about by the time you mean that when God deals with our life that there's complexes that we have to overcome yeah and even after we've been born again sometimes we can still develop them brother bam said they can be easily built he identified it in his own life what is it it's overcoming it's overcoming and here we're getting now look what Gideon did get in you know everything get input get in what do you do in the presence of God he said wait right here he presented the Flesh and the broth the prince of God came down and consumed it then we have the fleece due on the fleece next night do all around it none on the fleece God did it then when it came down to you know going down to smack the midianites remember there had to be a trimming down but then when it came down for that that battle because see everything along the way God was equipping Gideon every every time in his presence remember the altar of Baal was tore down then more would keep keep taking place the more that he presented himself in God's presence and then finally God told him I want you to go down to a tent down here because I want you to hear a dream that's going to be told you know in the middle of everything because we know the outcome what what took place is Gideon became so inspired what was happening there was a growing taking place to where you took a man who was a coward but God brought out the mighty man that he saw there the whole time and God brought that man into position to where when the enemy took off in that battle the two leaders Gideon pursued after him Gideon said the gas is down to the floor and we're not stop until we get these guys I think that's what it is about our lives how God will work and move in areas of our life of things that you thought I never pursue like that but God you let God take a hold you stay in God's presence you'll find yourself putting the gas on the floor and pursue it after your enemies God never got angry God never got angry with Gideon God never said I put it on the fleece there now you want it on the grass and not the fleece you don't read God getting angry you don't read God getting frustrated you don't read God being impatient what's God doing he's working with one of his children to bring them in position and God is Not shaken by our complexes God is Not shaken by our intimidation of our inabilities God is not moved by that he has confidence his word will come forth if we'll only abide in his presence this quote I'm going to quote to you here this is what pressed on me here even was I've meditating on this how many remember the little woman she was a very an ill-famed woman Mary Magdalene how many remember Mary Magdalene she saw him sitting in Simon's house now she did not know how she was going to get to him you know she went and got the ointment the alabaster box you you recall that but she doesn't even know how am I going to do what I'm being led to do how am I going to do that and you know what brother Brahms says I think this is such a to me such a direction for you and I that she went forth to do what the pulsation of Faith had struck her heart to do and brother Brown said she went to do it without knowing how she was going to do it oh God I believe that's where we come to I believe that's something where we where we should live is not worrying about how am I going to do it but when he pulsates to our heart just to get into his presence he'll make a way he opened up her tears and he washed his feet she didn't know brother Joey how is it going to happen all she knew is inspiration is striking me go minister to him and when she got there in her in his presence what was in her was released in his presence or was it and identified gift of God how many get weary I got both my hands up I may get weary anybody get weary in well doing this is my last in part of that last point you get weary right you get worried the Bible tells us that in Galatians 6 be not weary in well-doing for if we if we continue if we're sowing the right things and we shall reap the Harvest so it's warning us you can get weary you you can get faint those things can happen within your life but this is why coming back into his presence and saying Lord I need a fresh refilling of the Holy Ghost I need a fresh refilling because what a refilling does it's a Revival within our life that cleanse and cleans out all of maybe trash and things that's built up in our life sometimes I don't think of trash so much as things of the world so much as Sin but sometimes it's just our own dwellings and not dwelling in the prince of God it begins to become accumulation of things that doesn't lend itself to us yielding it calls us to do what I want to draw back I want to draw back but you see what that is that's Satan's trap because Satan is afraid of you getting in his presence Satan knows if he can keep you out of his presence he can trap you he said I see there wasn't nothing to it I'll look at you you've allowed this and look at you you've allowed this to come in and look you've been there and he can point to so many things well you've let down on this and you've let he can point what's he trying to do he's trying to keep you from where you rightfully belong you belong in the prince of God it's God who is your maker it's God who is your Redeemer it's God who knows all about you it's God is the one who moves and works in your life it's God who builds faith in your life for him to work but sometimes we get weary we get weary and I don't care how you know no matter where it's at you get weary but this is why we need a refilling that's why we need a refilling of the Holy Ghost Lord is clearing out a realigning getting the distractions and that refilling isn't just like a plugging up and well plug up that we recognize Lord now just simply entering back into his presence right here you're already in his presence but just to acknowledge it and do what what do I do before you try to present anything just fall down and worship him thank you Lord for speaking to me I'm unworthy that you would come by my mouth but I recognize your presence Lord what are you doing you're doing just exactly what it runs in the family to fall down and to worship him you'll know when to release the gifts you'll know and to release your heart you'll know when to release it but let's just worship Him invite him in that's what brother Brown could say in images of Christ I love that statement in the message brother Rams says while this Tabernacle is going through a Revival I want a Revival in my own life I love this statement he says I want more of the Holy Ghost to take over more of William Branham and here's why here's why so that I can be more of a servant like he was not I want more of the Holy Ghost so I'll be able to walk on the water I'll be no I want to be more of a servant Lord I need more I want to refill it for what frankincense because it all comes in that package Grace for us to die to ourselves frankincense to be put in service and deity to be displayed in our life what Grace has given to us let's pray Heavenly Father Lord God as we are the Lord drawn into these moments Lord I'm so thankful Lord that we can come and we can gather in your presence Lord and the Lord that not only do you know what our needs are but even in the times Lord that we do not even know what to say or how to say it
