[33:59] moses ran
[34:01] from all of egypt but when he got in the
[34:03] presence of god
[34:05] five minutes in his presence
[34:07] it unleashed a courage and a strength to
[34:10] turn around and walk off of that
[34:12] mountain and face everything that seems
[34:16] so insurmountable
[34:18] and that's the god we're serving here
[34:19] tonight
[34:21] he's the same god right here tonight no
[34:24] matter what you have before you he's the
[34:27] same god tonight all he needs is just a
[34:30] moment
[34:31] that's all he needs
[34:33] amen so as we look into the word and i
[34:35] just want to remind you this coming
[34:37] sunday the lord willing brother jack
[34:39] duff will be here ministering
[34:41] the word of the lord and so we're just
[34:43] looking forward to that as well i ask
[34:45] you just to keep that in prayer
[34:47] and let's go here and we're going to
[34:49] read it's a few verses of scripture here
[34:51] verses 1 and verse 2 and then i'm going
[34:53] to skip to verse 13 and 14.
[34:56] verse 1 it says and it shall come to
[34:58] pass if thou shalt hearken diligently
[35:01] unto the voice of the lord thy god
[35:04] to observe and to do all his
[35:06] commandments which i command thee this
[35:09] day
[35:10] that the lord thy god will set thee on
[35:14] high
[35:15] above all nations of the earth
[35:19] and all these blessings
[35:21] shall come on thee and overtake thee if
[35:24] thou shalt hearken
[35:26] unto the voice of the lord thy god verse
[35:30] 13
[35:31] and the lord shall make thee i want you
[35:34] to notice that word the lord shall make
[35:37] thee that word make is it it deals with
[35:39] the creative work of god
[35:43] the lord shall make thee the head
[35:46] and not the tale
[35:48] and thou shalt be above only and thou
[35:50] shalt not be beneath
[35:53] if that thou hearken unto the
[35:55] commandments of the lord thy god
[35:57] which i command thee this day to observe
[36:00] and to do them
[36:02] thou shalt not go aside from any of the
[36:04] words which i command thee this day
[36:07] to the right hand or to the left to go
[36:09] after other gods
[36:11] to serve them
[36:13] may god bless you bless the reading of
[36:15] the word
[36:18] i would like to continue to speak on
[36:20] that thought we were looking at the last
[36:22] time on the midweek service on when
[36:23] prayer changes
[36:25] this has been a thought that going into
[36:28] when we started with prayer there back
[36:30] in january this particular thought has
[36:32] just been one of those parts of just
[36:34] waiting
[36:35] on on the leading of the lord of when to
[36:38] bring and when to move into this
[36:40] avenue of it and
[36:42] we know that when we're looking at this
[36:44] here in in deuteronomy chapter 28 it's
[36:47] very important that
[36:49] our placement
[36:50] and our position in christ
[36:52] is that which is given to us by god
[36:56] before the foundation of the world
[36:58] and that when we see the book of
[37:00] deuteronomy you see the book of joshua
[37:02] it was a type of what we
[37:06] could come to as believers
[37:09] in the word of god in this day that
[37:11] we're living in that there would be a
[37:13] positioning and a placement in christ in
[37:15] our life and to think when we see this
[37:18] here that there is no there is no way to
[37:20] come into position
[37:22] or authority outside of the word
[37:25] but it is the word that brings us into
[37:27] that place that brings us into that
[37:29] authority and brings us to that position
[37:32] that god has for our life so
[37:35] god was declaring here the power of the
[37:38] word that would move in the life of the
[37:40] believer and i i want you to keep this
[37:42] in mind
[37:43] that when we read here in the scriptures
[37:45] as god has said through moses if you
[37:48] keep my commandments and it's more than
[37:51] just keeping a letter because you know
[37:53] you can you can take the bible home with
[37:56] you and we know the bible is the is the
[37:58] mind of god in printed form but i want
[38:00] you to remember that it's more than just
[38:02] a letter we're talking about the person
[38:05] of jesus christ
[38:07] see when you recognize that the word
[38:09] itself is a person that is not just
[38:11] something that you hear at church it's
[38:13] not just something you're hearing or
[38:14] you're reading but you realize he is a
[38:17] person and that he comes to work his
[38:20] word in our life see god is a gentleman
[38:23] he won't do anything in our life without
[38:26] being invited to do it and god speaks
[38:29] his word by his presence then it comes
[38:31] to us to invite him as we say amen to
[38:34] the word of god we say so be it lord we
[38:37] are inviting god to come in and to
[38:40] fulfill his word in our life and it's
[38:44] not something we leave at church but
[38:46] it's what goes with us it's a living god
[38:48] it's a living presence that's right here
[38:51] with us each and every day of our life
[38:54] it's god who's working and bringing
[38:56] about change within our lives so it's
[38:59] the person of jesus christ and it lifts
[39:02] you in authority it gives you dominion
[39:06] and it places us as a son and daughter
[39:08] of god and i want you to think of this
[39:10] scripture here in first corinthians
[39:12] chapter 1 and verse 23
[39:15] and which says we preach christ
[39:18] crucified and unto the jews a stumbling
[39:21] block and unto the greek's foolishness
[39:24] paul's letting him know that if christ
[39:26] is not crucified we have no access into
[39:30] authority and into a position
[39:32] we we are we are still just going about
[39:35] just by by a word that is given to us
[39:38] there's no authority we've not come into
[39:40] position but because christ has been
[39:42] crucified and that sacrifice has been
[39:45] accepted the holy ghost has come back
[39:49] upon the believer to bring us into
[39:52] christ
[39:53] and just as he has been exalted and
[39:56] seated on the throne in our lives christ
[39:59] becomes exalted in our lives
[40:03] so we preach christ crucified and unto
[40:05] the jews a stumbling block and unto the
[40:08] greek's foolishness but unto them which
[40:10] are called both jews and greeks christ
[40:14] the power of god and the wisdom of god
[40:17] because the foolishness of god is wiser
[40:20] than men
[40:22] and the weakness of god is stronger than
[40:25] men
[40:26] for you see your calling brethren how
[40:29] that not many wise men after the flesh
[40:32] not many mighty not many noble are
[40:35] called but god hath chosen the foolish
[40:38] things of the world to confound the wise
[40:42] and god had chosen the weak things of
[40:45] the world to confound the things which
[40:48] are mighty and base things this is weak
[40:51] things of the world and things which are
[40:54] despised hath god chosen yea and things
[40:58] which are not to bring to not things
[41:01] that aren't now this is not
[41:04] this is not
[41:05] our way of thinking
[41:07] remember god said my thoughts are higher
[41:11] than your thoughts
[41:13] my ways are higher than your ways if it
[41:17] would have been up to us we would have
[41:18] never
[41:19] chose a couple in whom the woman was
[41:23] sterile and unable to receive seed
[41:27] but god already not then but before the
[41:31] foundation of the world all of these
[41:33] parts that were there with abraham and
[41:36] with sarah i wonder how many times that
[41:39] sarai we noticed sarah
[41:42] after her name changed after god did a
[41:44] work in her life but i wonder how many
[41:46] times before that that she could look at
[41:49] other women and say why can't i have a
[41:52] child
[41:54] she did not understand why do i have
[41:57] this weakness about my life why do i
[42:00] have this situation why is this me and
[42:03] sometimes let's just be real we can get
[42:05] into pity parties
[42:09] this was not this this in sarah's life
[42:12] was not the result of a choice by father
[42:15] mother or grandfather this was not the
[42:17] result of a choice that she had made
[42:20] this how she came into
[42:22] this earth and you and i would not have
[42:24] made that choice you and i would not
[42:26] have made a choice to have a man be
[42:30] known as a mighty man and take down the
[42:32] midianites who was known to be a coward
[42:37] by the name of gideon
[42:40] right you and i would never have chosen
[42:42] when you read in hebrews 11 you're not
[42:44] reading when we read the heroes of faith
[42:47] you're not reading about great big
[42:50] people in this earth you're reading
[42:52] about lives that came to a place in
[42:55] their life to know i am nothing and i
[42:59] cannot complete this task that god has
[43:03] called me to because god's word is a
[43:05] supernatural word spoken by a
[43:08] supernatural god that must be fulfilled
[43:11] by him
[43:12] so it's a life that is born of the
[43:15] supernatural and yielded to the
[43:17] supernatural that's the working of the
[43:20] person of christ it's not you and i that
[43:22] make ourselves anything
[43:27] god has chosen
[43:29] the weak things of the world he didn't
[43:30] say that he did not choose any that were
[43:32] mighty or noble but even those like
[43:36] moses who were mighty
[43:39] who were noble god had to bring him to a
[43:42] place to where they realized
[43:45] humanness is a failure
[43:49] human ability can never accomplish the
[43:52] purpose of god if i could just take on
[43:55] that tonight i'd love to preach on that
[43:57] for a while
[43:58] human ability will never satisfy the
[44:01] requirements of almighty god
[44:05] we cannot serve his purpose on human
[44:08] ability on what we do this is why it's
[44:11] more than just i do this i don't do this
[44:14] i do this i don't do that that's a
[44:17] letter
[44:18] but the person of jesus christ is a
[44:21] living person that goes with you
[44:27] right
[44:28] it's there that dwell it's him dwelling
[44:31] in our life that we seek to please we
[44:34] seek to yield our lives and to his
[44:37] working
[44:38] so here god lays all this out in verse
[44:41] 29 it comes down here's the conclusion
[44:44] of it that no flesh
[44:46] should glory in his presence
[44:49] moses i'm calling you to deliver a
[44:51] message
[44:53] again
[44:54] to talk talk
[44:56] well
[44:56] the bible said he was of a slow tongue
[44:59] right he didn't have a speech language
[45:02] pathologist to help him out there god
[45:04] put it that way
[45:06] you and i would have said there needs to
[45:08] be somebody who can speak
[45:10] if he's called to deliver a message but
[45:13] god didn't call him based on his human
[45:15] ability god called him because he was a
[45:18] chosen vessel of god
[45:23] hallelujah
[45:24] and faith that faith that was so
[45:27] inspired into his heart that god is
[45:31] faithful
[45:32] that worked in moses life to where there
[45:35] is no flesh
[45:37] that can glory in his presence
[45:40] but of him this is where it all comes
[45:42] down to
[45:43] but of him are ye in christ jesus who of
[45:46] god is made unto us
[45:50] wisdom he is our wisdom
[45:53] we have no it's not no wisdom on our own
[45:56] he is our wisdom
[45:59] he is our righteousness because our
[46:01] righteousness alone is filthy rags
[46:05] is that right i'm talking about his life
[46:09] inside of us he is our righteousness he
[46:12] is our sanctification
[46:15] he is like the oil in the dove where the
[46:18] oil works from the inside out to keep it
[46:21] clean
[46:22] when stuff gets stuck on it there's an
[46:24] oil of power on the inside that works to
[46:27] the outside to help deliver us from this
[46:30] sticky one
[46:33] are you hearing me now
[46:35] and he is our redemption
[46:39] all of these parts this is who he is
[46:42] outside of him there is no redemption
[46:45] and redemption is being brought back to
[46:48] the rightful owner
[46:51] you didn't belong to the devil you
[46:53] belong to god
[46:55] are you with me you didn't belong to the
[46:57] devil and all of a sudden god come down
[46:59] and paid the price and now you're
[47:00] redeemed that's not redemption
[47:03] redemption is you come back to the
[47:06] rightful owner
[47:09] and that's what god came to do
[47:12] through jesus christ and that's why he
[47:14] sent the holy ghost to bring us back to
[47:17] that rightful position
[47:19] that according as it is written
[47:21] he that glorieth let him glory
[47:25] in the lord
[47:27] now brother branham takes this up and i
[47:28] read from this quote the last time
[47:31] to you all the questions in answers 59
[47:33] i'm just going to refer to some places
[47:35] and he's letting it be known that why
[47:38] and brother ban will keep moving into
[47:39] this of
[47:41] when israel came into canaan
[47:43] they come into the promised land
[47:46] there were wars that they had to fight
[47:48] there were battles
[47:50] but yet this land is where they belonged
[47:54] it was the rest that god had promised he
[47:58] would bring them to
[48:00] but they had battles they had things
[48:02] that had to be overcome things that they
[48:04] had to fight through is that right
[48:07] and brother brown would say it in this
[48:08] way he says
[48:10] you know he says egypt is the world they
[48:12] were called out of and the wilderness is
[48:14] where they were sanctified a called out
[48:17] church and canaan is where they settled
[48:19] down with the holy spirit because they
[48:21] still had wars and if you don't believe
[48:23] you have wars just get the holy spirit
[48:26] once
[48:28] now listen what are you doing what do
[48:30] you do in canaan
[48:33] is there resorts in canaan
[48:36] here's the spiritual resort
[48:38] and you just go to this resort you go
[48:41] behind this wall they'll bring you
[48:42] kool-aid and tea and everything else you
[48:45] want you just sit around there's no
[48:47] resorts in canaan
[48:49] but canaan
[48:51] is there we're battles there's
[48:52] temptations there's trials there's and
[48:55] and we're not immune from those things
[48:57] but here is in time of occupying what
[49:00] belongs to us
[49:04] is that right
[49:05] they were possessing their rights they
[49:07] were possessing their rights and they
[49:09] could not possess their rights till they
[49:12] got into
[49:14] canaan
[49:15] canaan being a type of the holy ghost
[49:18] is that right i'm just laying these down
[49:20] purposely very slowly they didn't own
[49:22] anything in the wilderness but when they
[49:24] come into canaan they had rights and
[49:26] we've got rights when you receive the
[49:27] holy ghost you're in canaan you have to
[49:30] fight for it
[49:32] every inch of ground you have to fight
[49:35] for
[49:37] every promise that god has made not one
[49:40] promise is ever and ever will be handed
[49:43] to us
[49:45] but every promise
[49:47] there is going to be a fight and satan
[49:50] is always there to stand as an
[49:52] opposition against the promise of god
[49:56] he's always there to tell you why you're
[49:57] not worthy why it doesn't belong to you
[50:00] he's always standing there as an
[50:03] opposition you say what do i do listen
[50:05] to the voice of the one who made the
[50:08] promise that has brought you face to
[50:10] face with the promise and stand there
[50:13] and call that devil a liar you've got a
[50:16] god who has spoke to you and you can
[50:18] stand on that word
[50:20] that's fighting for your rights it's
[50:23] fighting for what belongs to you the
[50:25] holy ghost is not just handed it is a
[50:27] gift but you've got to fight you've got
[50:29] to press beyond your own unbelief you've
[50:31] got to press beyond your own doubt
[50:34] you've got to press beyond humanness
[50:38] it's oppressing
[50:40] i'll tell you what
[50:42] that's what really shows whether and
[50:44] what really matters to us is when we're
[50:46] really ready to fight for it
[50:50] is that right
[50:51] the rapture itself listen friends the
[50:53] rapture is a war
[50:55] brother brown says this in a certain
[50:58] sound he said oh god
[51:00] may we be prepared for the battle of the
[51:04] coming of the lord
[51:06] and he deals with that thought because
[51:09] all hell has been released
[51:13] every demon spirit has been released
[51:19] revelations 9 is that right there there
[51:22] were there was one who came down he he
[51:25] fell falling down the star that was
[51:27] falling howarth they're falling from
[51:29] heaven on lucifer he had the key to the
[51:31] bottomless pit and noticed those spirits
[51:33] those demon spirits coming up out of
[51:36] there and pervading throughout the earth
[51:38] oh my but i love how revelations 10 1
[51:41] says and i saw
[51:44] another mighty angel
[51:50] blue devil and i saw another mighty
[51:53] angel
[51:54] [Applause]
[51:55] god he lost control his right in sync
[51:59] with his word
[52:02] hallelujah when something comes your way
[52:05] and stands before you it's not out of
[52:07] the oh what has happened to me no it's
[52:10] not what has happened to me but god is
[52:12] standing there god is in control and
[52:15] when opposition meets its way before you
[52:17] you can say here comes a testimony right
[52:20] now
[52:21] here comes a testimony somebody go ahead
[52:23] and get me a sheet to testify on
[52:27] well it ain't over yet it is over
[52:30] because it's standing as an opposition
[52:32] and i've got a direct word from god that
[52:35] there shall not be a man be able to
[52:38] stand before thee all the days of thy
[52:40] life
[52:42] you're even a possessor of death
[52:46] do you realize that brother branham
[52:48] preaching the message all things he goes
[52:50] into that right there he said do you
[52:52] realize death is even given to the
[52:54] believer it is your possession and he
[52:56] comes back and he preaches it and goes
[52:58] into it the very next service and he
[53:00] picks it up he said because some people
[53:02] just seem like they didn't understand it
[53:03] but to recognize what calvary has done
[53:06] and the baptism of the holy ghost you
[53:08] are not the tail
[53:10] you have been made the head
[53:13] and death is a possession of the
[53:15] believer
[53:17] oh glory be to god
[53:20] you have to fight for every inch of it
[53:22] now notice he said
[53:23] that's the reason
[53:25] that people can say brother branham you
[53:26] pray for me today
[53:28] he says you know you get over in the
[53:29] canaan once brother and you realize
[53:32] where you belong
[53:34] watch prayer
[53:36] start being turned around this is where
[53:37] we're garnering this thought you watch
[53:39] prayer start being turned around yes sir
[53:42] you say look here satan this is mine
[53:45] i'm a possessor of this
[53:48] god said so move out that's right move
[53:51] off my grounds your ground satan says
[53:55] i have an abstract deed to it move out
[53:59] you don't i'll serve notice on you by
[54:01] the holy spirit's
[54:03] guidance
[54:05] i'm gonna preach on that one tonight but
[54:07] there i will serve notice on you by the
[54:09] guidance of the holy ghost
[54:13] so to notice that prayer itself starts
[54:16] being turned around once we have come
[54:19] into canaan
[54:20] and i want to say it in this way prayer
[54:22] changes because now we are we are asking
[54:27] for what we are
[54:30] we're asking for what we are
[54:33] now i know many times we we pray and you
[54:36] know pray and we got sickness that comes
[54:38] up there's there's situations that you
[54:40] know there's different needs and you
[54:42] know job and all those things like that
[54:43] but
[54:44] those should not be the majority
[54:47] of what we're praying about or all we're
[54:49] praying about
[54:51] because we're no different from anybody
[54:52] else then
[54:54] we're not trying to make ourselves
[54:55] different but you see god makes known
[54:58] his word that you and i might pray about
[55:01] this word
[55:02] that's why when a person says well i
[55:04] don't feel any closer to god where's
[55:06] your prayer life at
[55:08] have you been praying
[55:09] have you been seeking have you been
[55:11] asking god to reveal himself we need
[55:14] prayer we need all revelation
[55:17] not brother baby said not just this book
[55:19] of revelation
[55:20] we need all revelation
[55:23] but as the word itself we we do not want
[55:25] to become complacent people we want to
[55:28] move within the word for this hour there
[55:30] are promises to be taken
[55:34] are you hearing me
[55:37] now notice you see it comes down to and
[55:39] i'm just going to say it very clearly
[55:41] you are the word
[55:44] you are the word hey listen
[55:46] you you can't get anywhere without there
[55:48] being a voice of authority that lets you
[55:51] know who you are
[55:52] these are your rights as a believer
[55:55] is that right in this hour it was
[55:58] necessary for a prophet under direct
[56:00] inspiration to say
[56:02] uh you're not getting it the way you
[56:03] should so i'm gonna call you bride that
[56:07] you might understand
[56:09] you see there's an authority in
[56:11] announcing and declaring who you are
[56:14] and it lets you know the rights that
[56:16] belong to you now notice this in
[56:18] philippians 2 verse 5
[56:20] let this mind be in you which was also
[56:23] in christ jesus
[56:25] let it be in you this is the working of
[56:28] the mind of christ the holy spirit in
[56:31] your life
[56:33] who being in the form of god
[56:35] thought it not robbery
[56:37] or a thing to be grasped after like oh
[56:41] oh i'm gonna try to be
[56:43] i'm going to try to be like god remember
[56:45] in the beginning
[56:47] when satan came to eve he said to her
[56:50] you shall be like gods
[56:53] they already were
[56:55] see what he came doing he came
[56:57] diminishing the position that god had
[57:01] already placed them in
[57:04] he sought to dis diminish it
[57:07] who being in the form of god thought it
[57:09] not robbery to be equal with god but
[57:12] made himself now this is overcoming
[57:14] right here
[57:15] but made himself of no
[57:19] reputation
[57:20] and took upon him the form
[57:23] of a servant and was made in the
[57:26] likeness of men
[57:28] and being found in fashion as a man he
[57:31] humbled himself
[57:33] and became obedient unto death even the
[57:36] death of the cross
[57:38] that's real overcoming right there
[57:41] he humbled himself
[57:43] to full obedience to the word of god
[57:48] remember the the declaration sacrifice
[57:51] and offering thou had us no pleasure
[57:55] but he says i have come in the volume of
[57:57] the book to do thy will o god
[58:00] right he is now coming to do the will of
[58:03] god
[58:04] god moving through
[58:06] his son through the redemptive work and
[58:10] hear this word
[58:11] how it's being fulfilled and coming to
[58:13] pass so humility if we look into
[58:16] ephesians 1 humility itself is to work
[58:20] work of the working of the purpose of
[58:23] god by the holy spirit
[58:26] humility is not somebody walking around
[58:28] and oh they're so humble they're so they
[58:30] might be very humble but given the word
[58:33] testing you see how humble they are
[58:35] right or they could be so humble
[58:37] or they wouldn't never just when you
[58:39] give the word test because remember cain
[58:42] was able to humble himself
[58:44] direct quotes cain was able to humble
[58:46] himself and worship but when the word
[58:49] came and said
[58:50] if you'll do like your brother
[58:53] thou shalt be accepted also
[58:56] his humility ended right there he said i
[58:58] ain't going no
[58:59] lower
[59:02] how contrary to the syrophoenician woman
[59:06] is that right
[59:07] hello somebody
[59:08] because the word itself identified and
[59:12] and identified that nationality and what
[59:14] she was a saphenishing woman a greek a
[59:17] gentile and noticed himself brother bram
[59:19] says like this jesus himself tried to
[59:21] discourage her
[59:23] because you see but the word cannot
[59:26] discourage the word on the inside
[59:31] are you hearing me now we can be
[59:33] discouraged because of our imaginations
[59:35] come on somebody our own thoughts and
[59:38] boy this don't happen that wasn't faith
[59:40] faith is right in god's word he don't
[59:43] try to figure it out faith just said god
[59:45] said it and this is how it's going to be
[59:47] it was made known to her and all of that
[59:50] that was being said at that time when
[59:53] she jesus said it's not meat to take the
[59:55] bread that belonged to the children and
[59:57] cast it to dogs watch what she did she
[1:00:00] said yeah lord but the dogs eat the
[1:00:03] crumbs from the master's table
[1:00:07] she had the ability
[1:00:10] not by her dna
[1:00:12] she had the ability by being a
[1:00:15] redeemable thought of god that when the
[1:00:18] word would speak she had the ability to
[1:00:21] submit herself and come under the word
[1:00:28] be to god
[1:00:30] real humility that's how we overcome
[1:00:35] real humility
[1:00:37] it's not what we determine oh i want it
[1:00:40] done this way
[1:00:41] we don't determine how things get done
[1:00:43] you can hear testimonies in church but
[1:00:46] those testimonies are there to encourage
[1:00:48] us and it may not happen the exact same
[1:00:51] way
[1:00:53] but it's the same god doing it
[1:00:54] nonetheless
[1:00:56] right
[1:00:57] someone else you know here
[1:00:59] they can they might receive their
[1:01:01] healing and it don't even pass through
[1:01:03] the medical route
[1:01:04] but remember all healing is of god
[1:01:08] if it comes through the medical route it
[1:01:10] isn't because there's a lack of faith
[1:01:12] that work of healing is of god and god
[1:01:16] works through his ordained channels
[1:01:20] come on friends you see this is where we
[1:01:22] have to get that old thinking out that's
[1:01:24] prideful thinking this is why we have
[1:01:26] when people get around it well i ain't
[1:01:28] going to take no aspirin i'm just going
[1:01:29] to have faith that ain't faith that's
[1:01:31] called pride
[1:01:34] you know what the best thing you could
[1:01:36] do is get your glass of water be smart
[1:01:37] about it and take the town on get over
[1:01:39] the headache and go do what you need to
[1:01:40] do
[1:01:42] because it all has to be god bring it to
[1:01:44] past
[1:01:45] it ain't no more spiritual because well
[1:01:47] i said this and i said this listen if
[1:01:50] god inspires you to say it then say it
[1:01:54] come on somebody
[1:01:56] see it dismiss it because we see what
[1:01:57] happened the enemy wants to draw us out
[1:02:01] into a place
[1:02:03] show thyself
[1:02:06] remember there's oppositions in the land
[1:02:10] and the only way you overcome these
[1:02:12] oppositions jericho ai and on and on you
[1:02:16] overcome them by humility to the voice
[1:02:19] of god
[1:02:22] my
[1:02:23] my my
[1:02:24] this is why in ephesians chapter one
[1:02:28] let me read here for a moment in whom
[1:02:31] verse seven in whom we have redemption
[1:02:32] through his blood
[1:02:34] the forgiveness of sins according to the
[1:02:36] riches of his grace how many partakers
[1:02:39] of that tonight
[1:02:41] thankful for that tonight wherein he
[1:02:43] hath abounded toward us in all wisdom
[1:02:47] and prudence
[1:02:48] having made known unto us the mystery of
[1:02:52] his will
[1:02:53] according to his good pleasure which he
[1:02:55] purposed in himself that in the
[1:02:57] dispensation of the fullness of times
[1:03:00] this is where we're at
[1:03:03] we're in the dispensation of the
[1:03:04] fullness of time there's not another age
[1:03:06] to come
[1:03:08] there's not another time to come we're
[1:03:10] living in the end time
[1:03:13] in the fullness of time but this is his
[1:03:15] promise that he might gather together in
[1:03:18] one all things in christ
[1:03:21] both which are in heaven and which are
[1:03:23] on earth even in him
[1:03:26] so he's speaking this verse speaks of
[1:03:29] the rapture it speaks of the
[1:03:31] resurrection
[1:03:32] is that right those that are in heaven
[1:03:34] and those that are on earth there's a
[1:03:36] gathering that is going on
[1:03:40] in whom also
[1:03:42] we have obtained an inheritance
[1:03:45] remember jesus never gave you an
[1:03:47] inheritance
[1:03:51] are you hearing me
[1:03:53] he never gave us one
[1:03:55] our inheritance was before the
[1:03:57] foundation of the world
[1:03:59] but we couldn't get to it
[1:04:03] we couldn't get to it
[1:04:06] you see there's a there was a a contrary
[1:04:10] between us and that of god we could not
[1:04:13] get to that inherent what inheritance
[1:04:15] are we talking about we're talking about
[1:04:18] the holy ghost
[1:04:20] that which brings about a real birth on
[1:04:23] the inside of your life that's an
[1:04:25] inheritance
[1:04:28] we have obtained that
[1:04:30] jesus himself brought us to that god
[1:04:33] came down
[1:04:35] he shed his blood is that right
[1:04:38] that you and i might come into that
[1:04:40] place that repentance would strike our
[1:04:42] hearts you know that's one of the
[1:04:44] greatest things that you can realize is
[1:04:45] that you're a sinner
[1:04:49] right
[1:04:50] that we need god
[1:04:52] to repent that i need god i'm i'm a
[1:04:56] sinner
[1:04:57] i need to be saved
[1:05:00] right
[1:05:01] then when that strikes the heart now
[1:05:03] notice all of that is made possible
[1:05:06] because the blood was shed and the holy
[1:05:08] spirit has come back to bring us to the
[1:05:11] realization of our inheritance
[1:05:14] being predestinated so this is not no
[1:05:17] willy-nilly event
[1:05:19] according to the purpose of him
[1:05:22] who worketh all things after the counsel
[1:05:24] of his own will
[1:05:27] that we should be to the praise of his
[1:05:28] glory who first trusted in christ
[1:05:31] i want you to look at this verse having
[1:05:33] made verse 9 having made known to us the
[1:05:36] mystery of his will
[1:05:38] the mystery of his will
[1:05:41] is the working of the holy spirit
[1:05:44] in our lives
[1:05:47] the holy ghost is the mystery of god
[1:05:51] paul would write in timothy great is the
[1:05:54] mystery of godliness
[1:05:56] is that right so the mystery of his will
[1:06:00] is the working of the person of jesus
[1:06:04] christ in our life a mind cannot figure
[1:06:06] it out remember when nicodemus stood
[1:06:09] right there and he talked to the lord
[1:06:10] jesus and jesus said except a man be
[1:06:14] born again
[1:06:16] he cannot understand see
[1:06:19] the kingdom of god
[1:06:21] right but whosoever is that is born of
[1:06:24] the spirit is he liking it it's like
[1:06:27] that of the wind you cannot tell from
[1:06:29] whence it came or whence it goes but
[1:06:32] it's like this nobody ever seen the wind
[1:06:34] blow
[1:06:36] oh yes i have brother say no you haven't
[1:06:39] what you saw is the effects of the wind
[1:06:42] on something out there
[1:06:44] right you didn't the only way you see
[1:06:46] the wind blowing is because there's an
[1:06:49] effect upon you or the leaves upon the
[1:06:52] tree and that's the way that the holy
[1:06:54] ghost does in the life of a believer it
[1:06:58] moves you in sync with god's word
[1:07:02] his will
[1:07:04] and this is why there becomes decisions
[1:07:07] and choices about your life
[1:07:10] that others won't understand now listen
[1:07:12] it'll never be contrary to the word
[1:07:14] you can never claim well the holy ghost
[1:07:16] led me to do this and it contrary to the
[1:07:17] word
[1:07:18] that's not the holy ghost
[1:07:20] is that right but the mystery of the
[1:07:23] will is the working of the spirit of god
[1:07:26] in our lives to direct us
[1:07:30] in the purpose of almighty god
[1:07:32] and this is why this is where prayer
[1:07:35] comes in this is why we're praying we're
[1:07:37] seeking god's will we're looking to the
[1:07:39] lord listen his word is his will being
[1:07:42] made known to our lives
[1:07:44] this is why we as we're praying and
[1:07:46] we're we're looking to god we are
[1:07:48] ordained to fellowship
[1:07:51] with the mystery of god
[1:07:54] we are ordained to fellowship with this
[1:07:57] mystery
[1:07:58] to have that relationship with the
[1:08:00] purpose of jesus christ and i just say
[1:08:02] it in this way the purpose of god
[1:08:05] it's bigger than you and me
[1:08:08] it's bigger and it's far greater than
[1:08:10] anything of this earthly life
[1:08:12] the purpose of god is is
[1:08:15] uh it's just so it's expansive it's
[1:08:18] beyond what we could ever bring it down
[1:08:20] and put it down just in a just in a you
[1:08:22] know something so
[1:08:24] uh minute but the purpose of god is so
[1:08:27] great how god moves a life and directs a
[1:08:30] heart and a life
[1:08:31] being led by the spirit of god
[1:08:35] you see with this reality
[1:08:37] he becomes
[1:08:39] the objective in the theme of our life
[1:08:43] let me move down past something here
[1:08:46] in second corinthians chapter 1 verse 18
[1:08:49] i'm just going to skip just something
[1:08:51] here
[1:08:53] but as god is true
[1:08:56] our word toward you
[1:08:59] was not yea in name
[1:09:01] for the son of god jesus christ who was
[1:09:04] preached among you by us even by me and
[1:09:07] salvenius and timotheus was not yea and
[1:09:10] nay
[1:09:11] but in him
[1:09:13] was ye
[1:09:15] it wasn't something that was
[1:09:17] it might be it could be
[1:09:19] but the word has been preached with the
[1:09:21] certainty
[1:09:23] by the power of the holy ghost
[1:09:25] god has confirmed his word to your
[1:09:28] hearts
[1:09:29] in him in him every promise is ye
[1:09:32] not how that we don't have to figure it
[1:09:34] out how it's going to be but in him it's
[1:09:36] yeah
[1:09:38] in him every promise is certain
[1:09:41] is that right
[1:09:42] for all the promises of god all the
[1:09:44] promises of god in him are yea and in
[1:09:48] him amen unto the glory of god by us
[1:09:53] all the promises are yea
[1:09:56] and in him amen unto the glory of god by
[1:09:58] us now notice
[1:10:01] how the lord jesus places this here in
[1:10:03] john
[1:10:04] 15
[1:10:05] and verse 7.
[1:10:07] if ye abide in me
[1:10:10] and my words
[1:10:11] abide in you
[1:10:15] if you abide in me and my words abide in
[1:10:17] you
[1:10:18] you shall ask what you will
[1:10:20] and it shall be done unto you
[1:10:24] you see
[1:10:25] even within
[1:10:27] this
[1:10:28] brother brown would would say it like
[1:10:30] this that in his life he said
[1:10:33] i knew he says when i was reading in the
[1:10:35] word of god and i began to see in my
[1:10:37] life i needed an absolute
[1:10:41] begin to read the promises of god he
[1:10:43] said i needed an absolute in my life now
[1:10:46] listen
[1:10:48] the word of god is an absolute
[1:10:51] is that right
[1:10:52] let me say this the word of god is an
[1:10:54] absolute when god sends a prophet
[1:10:58] come on now
[1:10:59] it's an absolute
[1:11:02] because it's god's word his thoughts
[1:11:06] that are being declared
[1:11:08] remember every time israel when those
[1:11:12] that crucified jesus were packing around
[1:11:14] the law
[1:11:15] they had the psalms they had the
[1:11:17] prophets and they crucified him
[1:11:20] and they had all of this and this is why
[1:11:22] you read in the book of micah obadiah on
[1:11:24] and on and all of them they got israel
[1:11:27] got away though having the psalms having
[1:11:29] the prophets they had if you can say
[1:11:32] they had the law they had scripture but
[1:11:35] they got away from the word of the lord
[1:11:40] you see when you have the word of the
[1:11:41] lord you can't just carry the bible
[1:11:43] around as a sinner when the word of the
[1:11:45] lord is spoken it brings this word alive
[1:11:48] and you realize who is this that is
[1:11:50] discerning my heart and my life and
[1:11:53] uncovering the unbelief i'll tell you
[1:11:55] who it is it's the same god who gave his
[1:11:58] word that spoke through the prophets he
[1:12:01] is the word
[1:12:03] [Applause]
[1:12:05] hallelujah
[1:12:06] if you abide in me and my words abide in
[1:12:09] you then you ask what you will and it
[1:12:11] shall be done then
[1:12:13] can you hear me now
[1:12:16] now when that word has become in you
[1:12:19] you become an absolute
[1:12:22] whoo i got quotes on this one now
[1:12:25] hallelujah can i quote it to you i'll
[1:12:27] just quote it from my memory brother
[1:12:29] brabham said when he said when that was
[1:12:30] made real or behold a virgin shall
[1:12:33] conceive and she did it when it said
[1:12:36] behold better than manuel he said that
[1:12:38] became the typos of the scripture when
[1:12:41] it was made manifest and he said that's
[1:12:43] the same way it is with the believer
[1:12:46] that is born again of the spirit of god
[1:12:48] in this last day they become the type
[1:12:50] host of that scripture the ultimate
[1:12:54] it's not me it's not you it's christ who
[1:12:58] is the ultimate
[1:13:04] it becomes the word that's why it's an
[1:13:06] absolute
[1:13:09] that's why we're deoked to the word of
[1:13:11] god it's an absolute truth it's not
[1:13:14] something that's up for debate
[1:13:17] that's why we don't have no time for you
[1:13:19] know well this is brother brahms opinion
[1:13:21] i got one statement for that
[1:13:23] i got one scripture that'll cover that
[1:13:25] and back that in the corner and blow it
[1:13:26] out of here behold i send unto you
[1:13:29] elijah the prophet
[1:13:33] are you hearing me because if we're
[1:13:35] gonna go by somebody else's opinion then
[1:13:37] we've got that's all we've got is your
[1:13:39] opinion and you're trying to lead us
[1:13:41] back into the bible god's already done
[1:13:43] that
[1:13:46] god's already done that he don't need
[1:13:48] preachers turning around and telling us
[1:13:50] what well this is brother branham's
[1:13:51] opinion
[1:13:52] god never called nobody to do that
[1:13:55] are you hearing me church
[1:13:57] this word that god has sent in this hour
[1:13:59] it's made to believe and become one with
[1:14:03] and to live by that word
[1:14:07] oh my it brings the greatest rest and
[1:14:09] the greatest reality i'm not worthy of
[1:14:11] trying to figure anything out only thing
[1:14:13] i know is that god has sent his word
[1:14:15] this word is to become flesh and there
[1:14:17] are obstacles that's in front of us but
[1:14:20] we are more than a match through jesus
[1:14:23] christ for every circumstance that's
[1:14:25] before us
[1:14:29] you see that's why when you start
[1:14:30] tampering with the word where does it
[1:14:32] stop
[1:14:34] and our life becomes so entwined in that
[1:14:36] and it goes right off the beaten path of
[1:14:38] what god's ordained for it to be
[1:14:40] see this message this message is not the
[1:14:43] mind of a man
[1:14:46] come on friends this message is the mind
[1:14:49] of god
[1:14:51] i can't make that real to anybody but
[1:14:53] that is the mind of god when it's made
[1:14:56] real to you and you see it in that way
[1:14:58] like brother brahman says once you once
[1:15:01] see the message you can't unsee it
[1:15:03] [Applause]
[1:15:07] and then what do you do you're moving
[1:15:09] with a perfect faith in your life
[1:15:14] hallelujah
[1:15:16] oh brother samuel i don't know if it
[1:15:18] needs to be said that's wrong no it
[1:15:19] needs to be said that strong because at
[1:15:21] times there's other voices that are out
[1:15:24] there and they're voices of confusion
[1:15:26] but we've got one voice and that's the
[1:15:29] voice of god of the holy spirit that we
[1:15:32] are to be in tune with
[1:15:36] i don't care if they're buddy i don't
[1:15:37] care their friend as soon as you step
[1:15:39] across that line and you make that
[1:15:41] statement you're tuned out
[1:15:44] [Applause]
[1:15:48] that's where that's what i believe and
[1:15:49] that's where i stand
[1:15:51] i know this message works
[1:15:54] i'm a product of this message
[1:15:58] it's jesus christ that has changed my
[1:16:01] life
[1:16:05] hallelujah i didn't change my life
[1:16:08] jesus christ changed my life
[1:16:11] this message is not books and tapes this
[1:16:13] message is jesus christ revealed to you
[1:16:16] and i
[1:16:19] it's not another dogma or believe this
[1:16:22] and believe it's back to the word of god
[1:16:24] it's god's heart's desire to be united
[1:16:27] with you in a relationship
[1:16:30] if you abide in me and my words abide in
[1:16:33] you
[1:16:35] you shall ask what you will notice you
[1:16:37] shall ask what you will and it shall be
[1:16:39] done
[1:16:41] showing that the word
[1:16:44] and the spirit has come into the life of
[1:16:46] the believer
[1:16:47] because you can't have the word
[1:16:49] and not have the spirit
[1:16:51] i'm talking about in your life
[1:16:53] and you can't say you've got the spirit
[1:16:55] and not have the word
[1:16:57] right
[1:16:58] we covered some of that on sunday you
[1:17:00] can't say well i've got the father but i
[1:17:02] you know i i i don't know about the son
[1:17:04] and you know well i've got the holy
[1:17:06] ghost and i don't know about that part
[1:17:07] of the word no they come as a complete
[1:17:09] package
[1:17:11] they they are one
[1:17:13] that's one clear evidence where the holy
[1:17:16] ghost has come into your life not only
[1:17:18] have you been changed not only has there
[1:17:20] been well this went on in my life this
[1:17:22] went out of my life thank god for that
[1:17:24] but there's something even greater than
[1:17:25] just cigarettes going out of your life
[1:17:27] or less going out of your life there's
[1:17:29] something greater and that is you have
[1:17:32] been united with jesus christ and it has
[1:17:35] moved you into the word
[1:17:39] amen
[1:17:42] you shall ask what you will and it shall
[1:17:44] be done you see you shall ask what you
[1:17:46] will
[1:17:47] when that desire has been changed on the
[1:17:50] inside then what are you asking for
[1:17:52] you're asking for his will to be done
[1:17:55] thou will be done in earth
[1:17:57] even as it is in heaven
[1:17:59] you're in contact with god
[1:18:01] you shall ask what you will and it shall
[1:18:03] be done you have not chosen me
[1:18:06] but i have chosen you and ordained you
[1:18:09] that you should go and bring forth fruit
[1:18:13] that your fruit should remain
[1:18:16] that whosoever you shall whatsoever you
[1:18:18] shall ask of the father in my name
[1:18:22] he may give it to you
[1:18:24] that's a that's a big statement there
[1:18:26] you've been chosen we've been ordained
[1:18:29] for what purpose
[1:18:31] that we should go
[1:18:33] and bring forth fruit
[1:18:37] fruit doesn't come up overnight is that
[1:18:39] right
[1:18:41] my wife she goes out there and checks in
[1:18:43] her garden every day
[1:18:45] looks to see if they're tomatoes
[1:18:47] you know or other things that's come up
[1:18:50] in the garden she looks at that
[1:18:53] and fruit doesn't come up overnight
[1:18:56] right
[1:18:57] apple trees
[1:18:59] orange tree all those it doesn't happen
[1:19:01] overnight
[1:19:03] it goes through a process
[1:19:06] is that right
[1:19:07] the bible says that they that receive
[1:19:09] seed into good ground bring forth fruit
[1:19:12] with
[1:19:13] patience
[1:19:16] patience
[1:19:17] is endurance
[1:19:20] taking the word in
[1:19:22] nourishing that word that this is why
[1:19:25] that when these scriptures apply right
[1:19:27] here in verse 16 it brings us to a place
[1:19:29] that we see we're possessing our rights
[1:19:32] in canaan
[1:19:34] we've not just come into a church and oh
[1:19:36] i go to believer spoken word tabernacle
[1:19:38] yeah brother samuel is my pastor i go
[1:19:40] there we recognize it's more than just
[1:19:42] coming to a church
[1:19:45] we recognize it's more than just well
[1:19:47] praise god i don't i don't smoke pot no
[1:19:49] more i don't run around no more i don't
[1:19:51] do there's more than that
[1:19:55] you can have all of that removed and
[1:19:57] still
[1:19:58] not
[1:19:59] be in fulfillment of the word because
[1:20:01] you must be born again
[1:20:04] it's where the word itself there's an
[1:20:06] evidence of the word that your desires
[1:20:10] have changed
[1:20:12] your desire is for him now listen
[1:20:14] it doesn't mean listen to me you don't
[1:20:16] grow up overnight
[1:20:18] but you mature
[1:20:20] so you can't compare your walk with
[1:20:23] somebody else's water
[1:20:24] just i'm just just feel the slow down
[1:20:26] there on this a moment you cannot begin
[1:20:28] to compare your walk with one of the
[1:20:31] veterans that's been walking here and
[1:20:32] you see them my goodness am i i want to
[1:20:35] be just like that remember it's not
[1:20:37] their flesh
[1:20:40] that is a product of many years of dying
[1:20:44] to self it's a product of many battles
[1:20:50] come on now
[1:20:52] it's a product of of many trials and
[1:20:54] many tests if you were to stop and to
[1:20:56] ask them at times are there times that
[1:20:58] you felt like giving up and they could
[1:21:00] say yes
[1:21:03] but it wasn't me holding on it's him
[1:21:05] holding me
[1:21:08] if you could ask them many times do do
[1:21:11] you do you you wonder about who you were
[1:21:14] yeah
[1:21:15] times i've i've wondered about sometimes
[1:21:17] i started to to look at different things
[1:21:19] and were there times that that that that
[1:21:21] that you felt so all the other times i
[1:21:23] felt alone
[1:21:26] because it's wrestling and out there's
[1:21:27] opposition that's always right here
[1:21:30] before us but it didn't come that way
[1:21:33] overnight
[1:21:35] but god told you and he told me as he
[1:21:37] told israel he said i will put the
[1:21:39] inhabitants of the land out
[1:21:42] little
[1:21:43] by little
[1:21:45] not big by big
[1:21:48] little
[1:21:50] by little
[1:21:52] what if you went into a house or you
[1:21:54] went into things being done and my
[1:21:56] goodness you know you
[1:21:57] you go in the house and you here they
[1:21:59] are they're building up they're maybe
[1:22:00] they're putting a wall up in some room
[1:22:01] and you go in there you're like wow
[1:22:03] praise the lord they got the wood and
[1:22:05] wow wonderful and you show up the next
[1:22:07] day and
[1:22:08] the wood's still there
[1:22:10] but they're laying out the plans
[1:22:13] did you go the next day
[1:22:16] you know what after a time you can go
[1:22:18] keep going and it seemed like i ain't
[1:22:20] seeing nothing but the work that they're
[1:22:22] doing is necessary
[1:22:24] for the wall to come together
[1:22:26] kind of like the song even when i
[1:22:28] don't feel it he's still working
[1:22:32] he's still working
[1:22:34] is that right
[1:22:35] but then you see little by little this
[1:22:39] is how the word is coming to pass in our
[1:22:42] life let me leave you with this
[1:22:44] let me leave you with this when we talk
[1:22:45] about
[1:22:47] in prayer
[1:22:48] and beginning to pray for things
[1:22:50] asking god
[1:22:52] to fulfill his word
[1:22:54] praying to the lord i know we've got
[1:22:56] many needs we've got my goodness i just
[1:22:58] had a prayer request that come in from
[1:23:01] brother mike walls here just just
[1:23:03] earlier today and different requests
[1:23:05] there's different needs that many times
[1:23:07] i it comes up from all over the world
[1:23:10] and different needs and sometimes just
[1:23:11] like they made mention of brother burley
[1:23:13] when i got that one yesterday early in
[1:23:15] the evening there and you know where
[1:23:18] brother burley was working and he he
[1:23:20] had a nail gun and that nail gun shot
[1:23:22] that nail right through his eye
[1:23:24] and uh
[1:23:25] you know they took him in for surgery
[1:23:27] they removed it
[1:23:29] and he just brother burley had asked
[1:23:30] that we just pray that there would be no
[1:23:32] infection saturn in his eye
[1:23:35] and thank god amen we still have brother
[1:23:37] burley
[1:23:38] amen love brother burleigh don't we
[1:23:40] appreciate him
[1:23:42] but you see there's so many needs that
[1:23:43] we have and sometimes let's just be
[1:23:45] honest we can become so caught up with
[1:23:50] the need sometimes i feel like when i'm
[1:23:52] praying
[1:23:55] sometimes i feel like that the needs and
[1:23:57] the list
[1:23:58] just right here in the church i just
[1:24:00] feel like the needs are just
[1:24:02] it's just so much
[1:24:05] there's times that i've you know i've
[1:24:07] come to a place in my life and i realize
[1:24:09] when praying for the needs of the people
[1:24:11] it isn't just of when i have my prayer
[1:24:14] time but i've asked god because there's
[1:24:17] sometimes and it isn't because i
[1:24:19] remember or somebody more i forget i
[1:24:21] tell you i live more and more seems like
[1:24:23] by posting notes and reminders and
[1:24:24] everything else
[1:24:26] but you know what i've come to the place
[1:24:27] and i don't bother me no more and that
[1:24:30] is
[1:24:31] if somebody comes to my mind and i don't
[1:24:33] care if i'm driving down the road
[1:24:35] i don't care if i'm walking through the
[1:24:36] store
[1:24:38] i just start praying for them
[1:24:41] pray without ceasing
[1:24:43] we've got a lot of needs to pray for
[1:24:45] sometimes we know this what i'm saying
[1:24:46] is that there's a lot of things that we
[1:24:48] can pray about sickness and needs and
[1:24:51] this one needs a job and there's we our
[1:24:53] whole time within prayer could be taken
[1:24:56] up with that and there's times we should
[1:24:57] be praying for one another when
[1:24:59] different ones come to our hearts that's
[1:25:01] all part of us taking possession in the
[1:25:04] land
[1:25:05] is that right it's not just about well
[1:25:06] i'm gonna get my mountain you get yours
[1:25:08] whatever no it's
[1:25:10] you need help let's go let's go take
[1:25:11] your mountain
[1:25:12] let's go do that god puts that on our
[1:25:14] heart
[1:25:16] but there's times
[1:25:17] as the word is coming forth just like
[1:25:19] when we get done when you finish a
[1:25:21] service or you're listening to the
[1:25:23] message you're reading in the scriptures
[1:25:25] it's things that as we're reading in the
[1:25:27] word of god i didn't get to this tonight
[1:25:29] but there's an effect
[1:25:31] upon being in the word of god our diet
[1:25:34] that has an effect on the way we pray
[1:25:37] the reason god shows us certain things
[1:25:41] as he will take us like he did to the
[1:25:43] disciples and they looked upon the field
[1:25:45] it was white ready for harvest and said
[1:25:47] pray ye that the lord of harvest will
[1:25:49] send laborers into the vineyard
[1:25:51] he knew what needed to be done
[1:25:55] but they needed to ask
[1:25:58] prayer
[1:25:59] you say it in this manner and i've got a
[1:26:00] statement i want to read to you
[1:26:02] prayer
[1:26:04] is an exercise
[1:26:05] of
[1:26:06] faith it's where we exercise
[1:26:09] our faith
[1:26:12] to pray if you have no doubt in your
[1:26:15] heart
[1:26:16] whatsoever you ask
[1:26:19] it shall be given unto you
[1:26:21] there's things that set before us listen
[1:26:24] when i say who doesn't want a closer
[1:26:27] walk with god all of us would raise our
[1:26:28] hands
[1:26:29] but we recognize going back to listen go
[1:26:31] back to philippians 2
[1:26:33] who thought it not robbery or thing to
[1:26:36] be grasped after we're not grasping
[1:26:38] after something
[1:26:40] it's who we are
[1:26:42] but it's yielding
[1:26:44] to the god
[1:26:45] who's on the inside of us
[1:26:47] it's us dying to ourselves
[1:26:52] it's god speaking to our lives and
[1:26:54] things that become so
[1:26:56] clear to us and we're praying and saying
[1:26:58] god let it be in my life it's a it's a
[1:27:01] relationship with him you know
[1:27:03] if all it is is well i get up a morning
[1:27:05] and i read a chapter and and that's
[1:27:07] wonderful i think you know what you need
[1:27:09] to be in the word of god but you see if
[1:27:11] it's only i got up and i read a chapter
[1:27:13] and i prayed 15 minutes
[1:27:15] that's a religious
[1:27:16] duty it's not a relationship are you
[1:27:20] hearing me
[1:27:21] but a relationship is that you realize
[1:27:24] he's not only there
[1:27:27] waiting at the breakfast table
[1:27:29] or at your chair
[1:27:30] but he also gets in the seat with you
[1:27:32] and rides down the road
[1:27:35] are you with me he said i'll be with you
[1:27:38] even in you to the end of the age
[1:27:44] we could really preach on the house of
[1:27:45] prayer the real house of prayer right
[1:27:47] now but
[1:27:48] listen
[1:27:49] brother branham makes this statement
[1:27:51] who has more
[1:27:53] authority
[1:27:55] in the presence of god
[1:27:57] an angel
[1:27:59] who never did sin
[1:28:02] or a son and daughter of god
[1:28:09] a son and daughter of god
[1:28:11] has more authority
[1:28:13] in his presence
[1:28:15] because angels
[1:28:17] are servants
[1:28:20] we were never made to be servants
[1:28:23] but when the holy ghost has come this is
[1:28:26] him i have made thee to be the head and
[1:28:29] not the tail
[1:28:30] it is the work of almighty god in our
[1:28:34] life
[1:28:35] that lifts us into that place of a son
[1:28:38] and daughter of god
[1:28:41] that that we would recognize brother
[1:28:42] branham would take this time and i'm
[1:28:44] ending on this point right here
[1:28:47] he would take this time
[1:28:49] and speak to you and i to remind us what
[1:28:51] has brought this about in our life
[1:28:54] because he says within this
[1:28:57] he said to think of it
[1:28:59] when the holy spirit he said has come
[1:29:02] he said
[1:29:03] a sinner that's been saved by grace
[1:29:06] he
[1:29:07] son has more authority
[1:29:09] than a servant does
[1:29:12] listen to this statement here everybody
[1:29:14] listening
[1:29:15] listen this statement right after that
[1:29:17] when he's asked the question who has the
[1:29:18] most power before god and he said a son
[1:29:21] has more authority than a servant an
[1:29:23] angel oh
[1:29:25] we forget
[1:29:27] what we are
[1:29:30] we forget many times
[1:29:32] what made us
[1:29:35] what we are
[1:29:37] after we become what we are
[1:29:40] then we forgot
[1:29:42] how we got here
[1:29:45] you see faith itself oh it just starts
[1:29:48] moving in your life when you remember
[1:29:50] how you got to where you are
[1:29:54] we did not get here
[1:29:56] by our own self
[1:29:59] but it is
[1:30:00] by the grace of god his blood was shed
[1:30:05] with you and i in mind he made the
[1:30:07] purchase with us in mind and the holy
[1:30:10] spirit
[1:30:11] was sent to make our inheritance
[1:30:14] real to us
[1:30:18] and now we stand as sons and daughters
[1:30:21] of god
[1:30:23] you know sometimes our our mind
[1:30:25] can go this way or it can go that way
[1:30:28] but i'm thankful that god would so
[1:30:30] center our hearts and our lives by his
[1:30:33] word that we can stand upon this place
[1:30:36] to remember of who we are
[1:30:39] when needs arise situations come up
[1:30:42] remember who you are
[1:30:45] and who has made you what you are let me
[1:30:48] leave you with the scriptures it's okay
[1:30:50] psalms 100 verse 3.
[1:30:53] many scriptures we could read with this
[1:30:55] but let me just read this scripture
[1:30:57] know ye that the lord he is god
[1:31:00] it is he that hath made us
[1:31:04] and not we ourselves
[1:31:07] we are his people
[1:31:09] and the sheep
[1:31:11] of his pasture
[1:31:13] we have not made ourselves
[1:31:16] he has made us
[1:31:20] is that right
[1:31:22] so to remember that no matter
[1:31:24] what what opposition no matter what
[1:31:27] situation arises we are facing it
[1:31:31] by relying
[1:31:34] on what the word has made us to be
[1:31:38] see we're not relying upon anything else
[1:31:40] other than
[1:31:41] the working of what the word has made us
[1:31:44] to be
[1:31:46] in every anything that is that is there
[1:31:48] before us it doesn't matter if it's a
[1:31:50] jericho it's an ai it doesn't matter
[1:31:51] what city it is doesn't matter what
[1:31:53] giant it is
[1:31:56] it doesn't matter
[1:31:58] what matters is
[1:32:00] is we're facing that
[1:32:02] by relying
[1:32:04] on who we are
[1:32:06] and who we are made to be
[1:32:09] let me just say it very clearly we are
[1:32:12] the word
[1:32:15] it's not something we're trying to grasp
[1:32:17] a hold of see this prayer isn't oh i'm
[1:32:19] trying to grasp this prayer isn't doing
[1:32:21] that remember what real prayer is
[1:32:24] prayer
[1:32:25] is submitting ourselves to the will of
[1:32:27] god
[1:32:28] thy will be done lord
[1:32:30] lord let that word just so come into my
[1:32:33] life you see it's having a relationship
[1:32:35] with him
[1:32:36] can you imagine what it would be like in
[1:32:38] your home
[1:32:40] if after you walk down to the service
[1:32:42] those of you those of us that are
[1:32:43] married and you never talk to one
[1:32:45] another
[1:32:47] right
[1:32:48] wow
[1:32:50] you're quiet in here
[1:32:51] can you never talk to one another
[1:32:55] yeah my there would be a real be a real
[1:32:57] disconnect right now stay with me here
[1:32:59] keep your mind in here
[1:33:01] you see this is where the person of
[1:33:02] christ this is why it's not a code of
[1:33:04] laws
[1:33:06] he's a person
[1:33:09] he's one we have relationship
[1:33:12] with him
[1:33:13] we talk to him about everything
[1:33:17] when situations arrive even temptations
[1:33:20] that come in our lives we talk
[1:33:23] to him
[1:33:25] it's part
[1:33:27] of overcoming
[1:33:29] its part of walking in this promised
[1:33:31] land
[1:33:32] prayer changes
[1:33:35] because the one important thing is
[1:33:39] we're no longer praying
[1:33:41] when we're not just praying with a
[1:33:43] hope
[1:33:44] we're praying with this is mine
[1:33:48] this belongs to me
[1:33:50] god has given this to me
[1:33:52] whether sickness arises or whatever more
[1:33:54] we
[1:33:55] have
[1:33:56] the assurance of god we want to bring
[1:33:58] forth fruit don't we
[1:34:01] i tell you the one the one thing that is
[1:34:03] so key
[1:34:04] in every one of our lives in every life
[1:34:07] and i think we as we went on that for
[1:34:09] some time here back in maybe january
[1:34:11] february one of the things that you can
[1:34:13] never do we can never do too much of
[1:34:16] is pray
[1:34:17] and it's not just
[1:34:18] not just
[1:34:19] you know just words
[1:34:21] but it's actually losing sight of
[1:34:23] ourselves and really seeking the will of
[1:34:25] god and just staying in contact with him
[1:34:26] god's not asking you
[1:34:28] are you with me god's not asking us to
[1:34:30] become like monks
[1:34:32] walk around with scratchy brown robes on
[1:34:34] with a
[1:34:35] you know a robe or a rope around our
[1:34:37] waist that's not what god's asking us to
[1:34:39] do
[1:34:39] god's not asking us to become odd he's
[1:34:42] asking us to become sensitive more
[1:34:44] sensitive to him
[1:34:46] more sensitive to his will and praying
[1:34:49] about these things in our life i tell
[1:34:51] you there's an effect
[1:34:52] how many witnesses there's an effect
[1:34:54] when we're praying and we're seeking
[1:34:57] after god there's an effect in our life
[1:35:00] and remember
[1:35:01] it's praying at all times whenever
[1:35:03] something drops in your heart there
[1:35:05] might be a scripture that drops it might
[1:35:06] be something that you've read about
[1:35:09] something that that from a message that
[1:35:10] comes back to you and you can just say
[1:35:13] lord make that real to me
[1:35:15] i'm just expressing to you from my heart
[1:35:17] exactly how i approach things lord i
[1:35:19] know there's something here lord make it
[1:35:21] real to me
[1:35:22] there's things when god opens things to
[1:35:24] my life and i begin to see it in a
[1:35:26] certain way and i'm not talking about
[1:35:28] something of a revelation out here i'm
[1:35:30] talking about when i see myself in it
[1:35:32] personally
[1:35:33] i see his working in my life i see to
[1:35:35] where brother brian is melting down
[1:35:37] samuel and i look at that and i say lord
[1:35:40] jesus
[1:35:41] let it be in my life
[1:35:43] i don't just take it and it's a while i
[1:35:44] see it but that's i want that in my life
[1:35:46] lord let it become so preeminent that's
[1:35:49] when prayer changes
[1:35:51] it's praying
[1:35:53] it's asking for his will to be done in
[1:35:55] our lives
[1:35:56] amen heavenly father
[1:36:00] lord you are so merciful you're so
[1:36:01] mindful
[1:36:03] it just it overwhelms us lord when we
[1:36:06] think about
[1:36:07] dear god that as we read even in the
[1:36:10] first part of corinthians there that
[1:36:12] lord
[1:36:14] how you have chosen
[1:36:16] us
[1:36:17] in all of our weakness and all of our
[1:36:19] frailties in all those parts but
[1:36:22] it's not the weakness itself
[1:36:25] but it's that part of yourself
[1:36:28] that part within us that's really you
[1:36:31] god it's you working according to your
[1:36:33] word
[1:36:35] and lord through all of our weaknesses
[1:36:39] through all of
[1:36:41] everything lord god of
[1:36:43] our our humanity
[1:36:45] but it's the greatness of god
[1:36:48] that's working and moving in our lives
[1:36:52] and lord jesus
[1:36:55] may lord from this
[1:36:56] lord very simple thought
[1:37:00] of prayer changing
[1:37:03] may lord i pray that
[1:37:05] every one of us as we just looking and
[1:37:07] revisiting that that reality that
[1:37:10] lord in your presence even right now
[1:37:14] lord we have a greater authority
[1:37:17] than an archangel
[1:37:20] we have an audience
[1:37:23] with the king of glory
[1:37:26] lord jesus
[1:37:29] lord as
[1:37:30] you would just
[1:37:32] no matter if the angels were speaking at
[1:37:34] that time you would silence them
[1:37:37] at the request
[1:37:39] being made known of one of your sons or
[1:37:41] daughters
[1:37:43] lord i think right here tonight there's
[1:37:45] request
[1:37:46] that's not only here tonight but even as
[1:37:48] we
[1:37:49] would go from this place go from the
[1:37:51] presence of one another
[1:37:53] that we recognize lord of who we are by
[1:37:56] the presence of jesus christ
[1:37:58] lord who you have made us to be and the
[1:38:02] promises lord that
[1:38:04] you've given to us as your children
[1:38:08] lord that when we pray we're we're not
[1:38:10] praying with a perhaps or a maybe
[1:38:13] there's an assurance lord that you've
[1:38:15] given us lord and these these promises
[1:38:18] lord that we are praying over lord as
[1:38:21] we're praying oh god that we would be
[1:38:23] counted worthy lord to escape lord these
[1:38:26] things
[1:38:27] praying lord as i hear the prophet cry
[1:38:30] out there and that
[1:38:31] one of the last messages of leadership
[1:38:33] and
[1:38:34] he's speaking of the insanity that's
[1:38:36] upon the world and the condition and he
[1:38:38] says oh god don't leave me here lord
[1:38:42] lord jesus we're we're looking to you
[1:38:45] lord
[1:38:46] that god knowing that
[1:38:48] every
[1:38:49] everything that we have before there's a
[1:38:51] battle
[1:38:53] that god
[1:38:54] may we press that battle lord
[1:38:57] may we take a hold of every promise of
[1:39:00] god lord
[1:39:01] perhaps here tonight i'm lord there can
[1:39:04] be lies that's that's never really fully
[1:39:07] come into the holy ghost
[1:39:09] maybe there's lord been many things
[1:39:11] that's rid out of their life but they've
[1:39:13] never come to that place lord of a real
[1:39:16] a transformation lord to where that
[1:39:18] you're the very desire of their life
[1:39:21] lord
[1:39:22] to where it's been lifted to that place
[1:39:24] lord that oh god where you and them have
[1:39:27] been made one lord where you're the
[1:39:30] pulsation of their life lord may they
[1:39:32] realize that's their right tonight
[1:39:35] that's the privilege that's inheritance
[1:39:37] lord that you desire to make so real to
[1:39:40] them lord and that they would become one
[1:39:43] with that just like israel coming into
[1:39:45] the land
[1:39:46] father
[1:39:47] granted tonight lord
[1:39:49] lord perhaps here tonight there's one
[1:39:51] lord facing the lord an obstacle maybe
[1:39:53] it's a
[1:39:54] sickness in their body and lord we
[1:39:57] realize that sicknesses and things that
[1:39:59] come about in our body and lord things
[1:40:02] that that take place
[1:40:04] we also know that through that lord
[1:40:06] there's a molding of our character
[1:40:10] lord for
[1:40:11] it's it's gold that's being tried in the
[1:40:14] fire it's gold that's lord jesus as as
[1:40:17] our faith is being tried
[1:40:20] lord through the test and the trial of
[1:40:22] our faith it's more precious than gold

[1:51:48] you know as you just worship him
[1:51:51] and you just get just how the lord just
[1:51:53] takes it don't you know when you're
[1:51:54] praying don't try to order prayer
[1:51:58] if you don't get all the if you don't
[1:52:00] get requests out don't worry
[1:52:02] the requests are getting out
[1:52:05] if any of it just moves into that place
[1:52:07] it's like abraham said when we all
[1:52:09] witness of this
[1:52:11] you just throw out prayer with a little
[1:52:13] bit of worship
[1:52:17] then you go throughout the day and let
[1:52:19] me say this to you when you're going
[1:52:20] through a test you're going through a
[1:52:22] trial you see this as we come into the
[1:52:23] land
[1:52:24] it isn't let me hurry up and get this
[1:52:26] test out of the way so i can really
[1:52:27] start praying about big things that is
[1:52:30] big things
[1:52:32] every test and every trial
[1:52:36] has come
[1:52:38] predestinated from the hand of god
[1:52:42] it's not by chance
[1:52:45] but it's come
[1:52:47] right
[1:52:48] tailored
[1:52:50] to minister to us
[1:52:52] that we can die to more to ourselves
[1:52:55] that's part of overcoming right there
[1:52:57] that's part of praying
[1:52:59] you know what's happening within all of
[1:53:01] that
[1:53:02] it's christ coming to the forefront
[1:53:05] it's more of us that's dying
[1:53:07] it's christ that's rising
[1:53:10] so it's not let me get the trial of the
[1:53:11] way let me get the test all the way so i
[1:53:13] can really start praying about these
[1:53:15] these are the things right here this is
[1:53:17] the working of the word in our life
[1:53:19] amen
[1:53:21] don't you love him
[1:53:22] amen god bless you we're going to let
[1:53:24] you be dismissed in the in the name of
