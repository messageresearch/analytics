just give ourselves to you now Lord just ask your blessing Lord upon the remaining part of the service in Jesus precious name amen and amen amen God bless you tonight so good to be in the house of the Lord amen we want to look here in Job chapter 23 and uh just ask that your prayers were I'm going to go and join the family there and and be in the meetings there the youth meetings I also have some on Saturday to speak to the older youth that are gathered there and to be with them as well during that time so just ask that you would just just keep us in prayer brother the Boaz Romero will be standing in for me here or in for us on Sunday and I certainly just it's been a while since brother Boaz has been here and I had this planned out for a few months and last year sometimes you know you you duck in and duck out of things and last year when brother Nathan Erickson had asked me to come and speak to the older youth I drove down early there on a Friday morning turned around and drove back you know and and but I just I want to support that and so I want I know that just as we're there and I know there's a I know there's a work that God has to do and so it just be in prayer we have we have many of our young people that are there at least you know our boys and and a few others and I know some others that will be there and it wouldn't matter if it was our kids just alone but each one would need a real touch from God Amen and we just want them just just everything that I prayed for today is that God just take each and every one deeper because that's what we all need we want to go deeper in the things of God and so we just are are just looking to the Lord for that so just be in prayer for that for those meetings that that are there and I know they're they're already underway as well so in verse in verse 8. of job 23. job said behold I go forward but he is not there and backward but I cannot perceive him and on the left hand where he doth work but I cannot Behold Him he hideth himself on the right hand that I cannot see him but he knoweth the way that I take and when he hath tried me I shall come forth as gold and my foot hath held his steps his way have I kept and not declined neither have I gone back from the Commandment of his lips and I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food amen may God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated as you know we're just continuing to pour over this and there's a thought I was going to just continue to move forward with some other points there within of the faithfulness but I feel very drawn in my heart and just since last last Thursday and just looking at things and just meditating and waiting on the Lord and I want to just kind of go back into where we had left off last week in dealing with Abraham but before we get there you know when situations and things like job has encountered uh that's here in a test or trial and when things come our way it's what do we do when situations arise that are unpleasant to us right sometimes those are Pleasant unpleasant situation sure it can be a sickness but you know it's things that when it comes back to it that you know the scripture said that we are sealed until the day of our Redemption and that that speaks of that authority of that seal of God there's nothing that can break that seal when God has come down and he's recognized that seal is God recognizing our faith and God himself seals it with his own personal seal it's his life and through that quickening power it's no longer just our faith but it's God's faith that has come to operate on our faith and so then our faith just is natural remember brother Brown would always take this with Faith and he would show us and over and over in the message he would say faith that self-justice said is just as common as you starting your car and you came to church tonight but you recognize there's a lot of things that you could talk to people I I we you know I heard of a young lady or a woman when we were at a restaurant and she was talking about all of her plans she was getting off at 3 45 and you know she was going to go do this and go do that and had this plan for the weekend and just a lot of different family events and you know what there was no question in her mind whether they were going to do it or not there was faith but you see with our faith alone remember now think of the Statue of a perfect man it begins right there with faith but brother Brandon would tell us he says there are many people that have just even these virtues from their natural birth but we're talking about in the stature of a perfect man and the faith we're speaking of is not something that is given to us by our natural birth we're talking about that which comes from God which only his presence can bring into our life so it's not anything that we earn or we Merit but it is given by The Sovereign Grace of almighty God and that's why the basis when we look at everything from our walk and our journey and our life it all begins with faith everything that every every promise that is ever taken by God it's by faith and it's and we look at it and to know that you know as brother Ram said he says it's not the man praying for you that that brings the healing it's your faith in the finished work of Calvary so every gift of God true gifts of God are not to take away from the finished work of Calvary but every true gift of God is to put that reflection on the finished work that it's settled that it's over that your faith remember Paul said when he came among the people that your faith would not stand in the wisdom of man but it would rest in the power of God what God not only has has done but God coming and vindicating that word personally to the lives of the people so there comes to that place that our faith for every promise of God it's God moving in our lives I believe that every one of every person must have a true experience with God there's no exception of that and the new birth being born again is where then we are born of the faith of almighty God so then it's no longer us in our own and our self looking upon the word but now it is God's faith moving through our life to direct us to influence us to guide us that living reality that lifts us just from walking here in this sphere with these natural five senses and our five spiritual senses it gives us a Grace to be able to walk higher than what we've ever walked before and the truth of the matter is even with our faith and our walking God that when we look at our walk with God we we do not start out right away with a mature Faith but remember when you're born again when we're born again we grow and through that growing there's a maturing of our faith and I think back to when brother Branham was standing in on the wings of a snow white dove and you'd hear how Paul will speak of the faith and admonishing that that Faith would grow Owen would abound in the hearts of the people and brother Branham in the message on the wings of a snow white dove would say concerning the word that has been opened in this hour he said the visitation of those seven angels and what God has done and opened this word and he says like this it has led me to a faith I never had before so the revealing of the Word was God is revealing his word and I to me that makes a statement to you and I that it's not just all of a sudden just all at once we are changed by the new birth but there is a maturing of our faith and our walk with God that's why the stature of the perfect man is not let me get this then let me get this then let me get this adding to is simply increasing are you with me we come under the authority of the word for our day we are born of that message and of that word but it is God that's why in our life it's not that all of a sudden we've got patience well we've got all of that let's go up to Virtue no our patience continues to grow virtue continues to grow why we are a living breathing supernatural being of almighty God so there's a continual maturing and growing within our lives and so when we look at that ceiling of God coming back to that place of what do we do when when we're pressed and when hard times come and sometimes as I said we could stay a month of Sunday's trying to divide hard times but we you understand when it's something that comes our way that there is a pressure Upon Our Lives whether it's upon our mind our emotion our body whatever it might be maybe it's someone has offended you or someone has said something but what is it that you do when that comes your way you see even when you find that there seems to be no resolve what do you do when that comes your way job himself had a testimony by God's grace that he could say and this you know that that I've kept his way and I've not declined because job wasn't living by his Own Strength he was living by the strength of almighty God that's why the Book of Job is such a very important book it's the oldest book in the Bible it's it's that it's this even within this revelation we see it's laid out even in the hour that we're living in it's that which would speak just as God bragged on job it's the same way that God has continued to brag on every one of his children now I don't know about you but my hand's not up to ask God to brag on me because I you know in myself and I trust you would feel the same way you know I look at myself and all we can say is is that Lord I'm standing in need of your grace but God when job I'm sure job did not stand there and job see himself as far as in all of his elements as a perfect and upright man but God was looking at his confession and his confession was in the blood his confession was in the sacrifice and that's what God was speaking to was who that real man was down on the inside and that's what was coming out you see this trial itself job said when he had tried me I shall come forth as pure as gold this trial was not going to be something to overthrow job but it would be a trial that would absolutely manifest the glory of almighty God it would not be something that would draw glory and praise to job but it would be the glory of God that would be made manifest in job's life because job was standing by the strength of almighty God in this moment and that's why it's so imperative that we have the Seal of the Living God because no matter what comes our way it doesn't matter what takes place it doesn't matter you know what what what comes or goes brother Randall would speak of this in Abraham's Grace Covenant he said it doesn't matter who says what but here you are sealed until the day of your Redemption so it's a seal it's something that is keeping us there it is something that you and I are recognizing that God not only is certain but I am certain of where that I'm standing in God and that is and that has an effect Upon Our Lives I want to just I want to read here just a few of them referring to this quote once again out of three kinds of Believers and out of this you know I've read it I've referred this many times but this is really the basis for what we're speaking on on being faithful because it's something as we've looked at it here in scripture and we've just started to scratch it God himself looks at faithfulness in a very Highway that's the very that's the quality that God is looking for because when it speaks of those who come back with him from the wedding supper into the battle of Armageddon it says and with him come the called and the chosen who are called the faithful so when it's all said and done it's not anything about anything that we've done but it just simply speaks the faithful and let me just say have what a blessing it is to be faithful and that is to be faithful at all points it's faithful not only when we're in the house of God but faithful when we're not in the house of God it's faithful at all times why because God is not just the God of this building but God lives inside of your Tabernacle God walks in your shoes leather and God wants to make himself known through your life in my life and God uses the circumstances and the trials and the tests of Life are actually the grounds whereby that God is proving his word through the life of his believer it's actually through those things that where God himself is being made manifest through the lives of his people this this statement I keep writing reading it but it speaks so deep and I I'm certain that I can't even we can't scratch the surface of it but God knows what we need for just this moment that we're in the Bible would say or but brother Brown would say the trials Dusty Rhodes and hot son of persecution uh you know but the Loyalty of your heart uh he says the Loyalty of your heart is what beats that material till she is ready to go into the mold and God's children is made up correctly on his word for they are living examples and the word of God is living through them and the trial comes to shake you put you to the very bottom to see where you'll stand and they tested they tried every son that cometh to God so the Loyalty of your heart that's what beats the material I I know I don't have to ask the hands but as I said when we go through something that you are you go through you it's it is staying it is where our hearts are remaining steadfast in the Lord and not something that where we run away when a situation becomes difficult or it becomes hard right listen situations and things come that can try to bring Gloom over your life try to bring despair over your life the many times there can be just like we had out here today all of a sudden clouds came up and you think where did those clouds come from right you look on your weather forecast and there's no prediction of any rain coming and you wonder where did this rain come from where did these clouds come from and many times with tests and trials that's exactly what it is whether it's offenses whether it's sickness no matter what it is but what is it that actually beats the material is where we stand faithful in the midst of that time how do I stand faithful what does that visual look like does that visual look like that it means I'm skipping Every Beat of the way it doesn't mean that at all but it means that from within our heart we're looking to God even in the midst of Anguish and despair we're called calling out to God even when there's situations in front of us that God that there needs to be a move here Lord and we're looking at that and in the midst of that time we're asking oh God mold me shape me Lord take out of me Lord whatever Lord the purpose is within this I'll tell you what that is that's loyalty that's in our heart beating the material that even when you've prayed and you've asked God for certain things and he doesn't answer how do you respond do we draw back do we get well I don't know it just seems you know a little like that's all a testing because if God if he answered every time that we spoke to him we would become very spoiled but you see God God loves to prove he loves to prove his children God loves to show and uh my I just I just feel like I could go a million different ways here but I just want to follow what he wants here but God himself think of it of how that God desires to bring forth out of our life God wants to see himself reflected in you and me he works Upon Our Life remember our brother Bram talks about him taking that that medal and he beats it and he beats it and he beats it until he sees his own reflection in it the same way with tests and trials that we go through you know who's really the one that's actually being defeated in the midst of that and that's that old carnal sticky nature that surrounds us that's what's being brought and reduced to nothing that's why the scripture could say that the Excellency may be of the power of God and not of us in Earthen vessels God has placed his life vessels that are frail and that Frailty shows itself we're aware of our Frailty right and we see that but see in recognizing a Frailty it's through that moment that we're calling out to God in the midst of our Frailty you see the weaknesses this is why the prophet says don't make excuses for your weaknesses he said but submit them to the Lord in prayer give their God those weaknesses and he says God will pour himself in those channels and use himself these things only what do they do it exposes the humanity but that's not where we need to stop looking at it's to look to almighty God because it takes God to harvest God amen we are not being raptured by a word of a man we're not being raptured by a denominational thought we are being raptured by the thought of almighty God it's taking God to draw out of our lives and what is God doing he's drawing out himself when it's all said and done when it's all said and done oh God May our character reflect his and I want to just draw here just for a little bit we've read from this point here of First Corinthians 1 9 and I've referred to this many times God is faithful because we cannot even have a basis for our faithfulness without seeing him because there's no and and not only a basis but there's no faithfulness outside of God and God's faithfulness God's faith moving in our lives God is faithful and this is why that that it takes God moving Upon Our Lives because if it's not God moving on our lives then if it's man moving upon man then it's man being faithful to man is that right that's what every false ISM and Doctrine everything has been it's been man now conforming man to man's idea but that's the difference with the message of the hour it's not the man the ideas of a man this is the mind of Christ that has come down Among Us amen because a man could look at you and me and say no hope your situation or my situation or your need it's beyond unraveling but God showed listen to me through every disease that was conquered through every sickness with Georgie Carter with different ones even in their lives God showed that there's no situation that is beyond recovery Hallelujah God is faithful why did God do that why is all of that recorded it's recorded for you and I and not just recorded but that you and I can recognize that that he's the same God for me for my need right here in 2023. God is faithful because if we can't recognize that that God is faithful then we in ourselves do not have any basis to begin or to act in faithfulness God is faithful by whom you were called unto the fellowship of his son Jesus Christ Our Lord now the scripture would go on to say these many of these scriptures you're familiar with Philippians 1 6 being confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ he will God continues to Faithfully work in our lives amen it's not something just overnight but he's working in our lives and that work in our life is even where the test and the Trials come in and the dying to ourself and through it all listen uh job even said it if I could come before his seat he said would he speak harshness against me no but he would put strength into me and that's where Peter said that God's will is after we had suffered a while that he would establish us and he would strengthen us so you don't come out of the trial weaker you come out stronger but not stronger you or me are not stronger in our own right but we are stronger in the Lord Hallelujah is recognizing more of him now notice being confident in this very thing that he which hath begun a good work and you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ in Hebrews 10 35 the scripture says cast not a way therefore your confidence which hath great recompense of reward for ye have need of patience that after you have done the will of God ye might receive the promise after doing the will of God the promise doesn't come before that but you see doing the will of God it starts inwardly within our hearts because even as a person can say well I've done everything but you watch sometimes that sometimes that attitude or that thought it's as though they're trying to barter with God you don't have to barter with God you can't barter with God it is simply from your heart and let me just say it like this I think we've been saying it over and over if my heart isn't there yet and no matter what promise it is if it's the promise of the Holy Ghost whatever it's asking God lead me to the place Lord bring me to that place oh God amen because after all it's not you or me that's making anything happen it's not it's not us it's God sovereignly moving it's God's sovereignly performing his word is that right so you know it's just like you know it's a person said well I I need the Holy Ghost well it's true but it's not you getting it it's God giving it is that right so this is why when brother Graham could say in restoration the brighter he said you need healing you need Deliverance he said you need the Holy Ghost let him take you there let him take you there now how does that come in by surrender and to be surrendered is to become a lamb oh my my oh my notice you have need of patience that after you ever done the will of God you might receive the promise for yet a little while in he that shall come will come and will not Tarry now I want to go to Hebrews chapter 6 verse 13. forgive us we were just a little bit short there on staff and uh Brianna's down there so Brianna does a tremendous job back there for us and we've had others there before too and notice this year in Hebrews 6 13 let me just read this to kind of to draw from here for when God made promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself saying surely blessing I Will Bless thee and multiplying I will multiply thee and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise see this is why testing comes in in our lives this is why testing comes we all can remember this when even first coming to the Lord we are tested you're tested and sometimes no matter us or or others and you see here under that testing here we come right back what do we do go right back to to grounds that we're comfortable with not talking about before the New Birth has come testing it and you know what comes in fear wants to come in how are you going to do this how are you going to make this let me just say this to you any thought that comes in that produces anxiety never came from God that never because God said my thoughts concerning you are thoughts of peace and to bring you to an expected end it's knowing your rights knowing your grounds right and so when the enemy always wants to come and try to you know bring fear put us you know into certain ways in certain grounds and you know whether it's the promise of the Holy Ghost whether it's a promise of healing whatever that promise is but remember here after patiently enduring he obtained the promise it's faithfulness before God and that's where that within this if we can see this even as we look at this a little bit tonight right now concerning Abraham because I believe Abraham listen Abraham Drew from from that Revelation that was in job's life and let me tell you how confident Abraham was of that Revelation when it was time to bury Sarah he went to the field to the cave of machpila is that right he went to Barrett because he knew Job was buried there right it's same thing that when Jacob was down in Egypt he said don't leave my bones here take me back there and bury me there when Joseph was up there don't leave my bones here take me back there and bury their why because he knew by Revelation that the promise of Resurrection was in Israel in the land that God had given Abraham that is the Promised Land is that right that's the promised land and they knew that by Revelation how did they know that by Revelation because the same God that inspired it and taught it to job is the same God that inspired it to Abraham Hallelujah the same certainty that Abraham spoke with and acted upon is the same certainty that job had in his life can't you see that even in this hour that certainty as a Believer as a son and daughter of God it did not come of our own accord it came because almighty God Elohim himself coming down and breathing upon his word and breathing across our life that is why Revelation is so important in our lives remember job did not have a written book to go by is that right they didn't have that but what they had was the revelation and brother Brandon would say it like this and I've heard but now I see he said then that's the more important thing it's not saying that the Bible is not important but it says recognized that what is more important than knowing the letter is to know the offer is to know it by Revelation and the prophet takes that up when he's even giving his own testimony regarding you know uh little Joseph coming on and he began to just pray and thank God about the man in the Bible called Joseph oh Lord what a man and it begins to speak about that of Joseph and what a faithful man he was and the spirit of the Lord spoke to him and let him know that he's going to have you're going to have a son and calling Joseph but God didn't tell him the in-between God did not tell him the depth of the test that he would come through but think about this I don't know I pondered on that many times I'm just looking just as I'm listening that and works as Faith Express of how that when uh you know even the doctors came out and it was little Sarah that came forth and what they said to him you must have not meant Joseph you must have meant Josephine you see it was testings but he said I couldn't get it out of my heart this is I love how the prophet says it here he said because it was written in my heart and that's why he kept looking for it even when the doctor said she can't have another baby now listen friends I I believe in the wisdom I believe in wisdom and let's pray over and look over things I don't believe in us trying to ramrod the things of God you understand I want to just kind of qualify that statement there sometimes there's things where we could take something on a ramrod something simply because of what we want but this was not what brother Branham wanted this was a revelation so the decisions were made by the revelation when they said you ought to have her tubes tied you can't you shouldn't have any more children he was not making that decision because of his own fleshly desire he was making that decision because of the Revelation that was wrote on his heart wow how powerful is the revelation of Jesus Christ when it is wrote in the lives of the believer when God writes this word down into the depths of our heart there's a lot of things that can come our way that seem to disqualify and take away but when God has put the stroke of his own life and wrote upon our life oh brother and sister that Revelation is what we march by and Joseph came but you see after it patiently endured but God notice in verse 16 I'm just trying to get somewhere when God willing more abundantly to show unto The Heirs a promise the inmutability of pardon me go to verse 16. for men very swear by the greater and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all Strife wherein God willing more abundantly to show unto The Heirs of Promise the immutability of his counsel confirmed it by an oath that by two immutable things in which it's impossible for God to lie we might have a strong consolation who have fled for Refuge to lay hold upon the Hope set before us which hope we have as an anchor of the Soul both sure and steadfast which entereth into that within the veil whether the Forerunner is for us entered even Jesus made a high priest Forever After the order of Melchizedek so that word that was spoken confirmed by an oath is now resting inside of the heart of the believer that same word that reality is now an anchor of the Soul why do you have an anchor what's the purpose of an anchor on a boat what's the purpose of it because it's not just when you're driving out in the lake or when they're just driving out into the going out in the ocean but it's at times When Storms Come it's also at times you know that many times in seven I know some of the brothers they do the trolling and things like that we're fishing and so forth but sometimes you know it used to be you drop the anchor and there you're staying in that one spot because why when you drop the anchor and it hits the bottom you do not have to worry about being rocked up against the rocks unawares an anchor keeps you in one place and that's why that anchor in our show it's there it keeps us anchored through every test through every trial through every circumstance there's an anchor all waves might come feelings might come thoughts my come there might even be complaints that would arise out of our mouth but if there's an anchor that's there we cannot go anywhere because there is an anchor of our soul it is sure and steadfast and what does it do it reflects itself see it's easy for a boat to say it's anchored but it's another thing when you see it's anchored and how do you know that it's anchored because it's staying right there right and that's the same thing within our life that's why it is that that of the necessity and essential to be anchored in the Lord let me just kind of go back to the scripture this is where I just couldn't get the scripture off of my heart uh in Nehemiah chapter nine and I read this towards the closing of last service but this Nehemiah chapter 6 or chapter 9 verse 6. and notice here they are I'm not going to read this whole chapter but they are rehearsing in praise to the faithfulness of almighty God and they say in verse six let me begin there thou even Thou Art the art Lord alone thou Hast made Heaven the heaven of Heavens with all their hosts the Earth and all the things that are therein the Seas and all that is therein and thou preservers them all and the host of Heaven worship thee Thou Art the Lord The God Who did his choose Abram Abraham never chose God chose Abram but God's choice being made known calling to Abraham it became reflected because Abraham had to make a choice and so Abraham's Choice reflected God's choice is that right now notice here it is who did his choose Abraham and brought him out of the UR of counties and gavest him the name of Abraham there's a lot in verse 7 that skipped over are you hearing me you know you read it in Abraham's life there's a lot that's skipped over you want to know why this is what was important this is what came forth term with me to Hebrews 11. I want to just go here real quick I'll come back there in a moment but let's just go to Hebrews 11. now notice in verse 8. by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should have to receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went that was faith he was faithful to the voice that was speaking to him and what it was asking him to do at that moment God was not asking him in verse 8 go off for thy only begotten son because that hadn't come yet but God was calling him and had to call him out of the land where he was and into the land of promise and Abraham was faithful to that voice now it could look like well he still has his father still has lot with him but he's moving to where the voice is calling him to we don't see everything just exactly perfect right there in Abraham's life and God is but God's looking deeper than all the imperfections at that moment oh let me tell you something God has got such confidence in his word and he's got confidence that when his presence as he moves down in the Fulfillment of his word it's that which brings a loosening in our lives verse 9 said by faith he's sojourned in the land of promise has in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac Jacob The Heirs with him of the same promise so it goes on through verse 10 through verse 11 through verse 12 and verse 13 verse 14 and then here we find where it comes in verse 17 if we could go there by faith Abraham when he was tried offered up Isaac and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son of whom it was said that in Isaac shall thy seed be called accounting that God was able to raise him up even from the dead from whence also he received him in a figure that did not come overnight but it came through faithfulness faithfulness LED to more faithfulness if we look here in this scripture we're reading in Nehemiah 9 and 7 God brought him out of the earth counties and then even when you read here in Hebrews 11 Hebrews 11 it does not speak here of Hager doesn't speak of Ishmael why that was not a by faith that was by by Abram are you hearing me sure it brings a contrast to it but you see you see this is why that when it's all said and done when our commentary is written it is only going to be a commentary of Christ in you the hope of glory that's the faithfulness when it's all said and done because why God is faithful Faithful is he who called you who will do it who will perform his word now this is one thing that we find within this in Nehemiah 9-7 we can see that down through Abraham's life all of Abraham's actions were not always perfect is that right let me just get here because I'm all over here I'm just just just moves just just jumped it always wasn't it always then Abraham's actions didn't always match the promise but in his heart he was ready to repent when the word corrected him that's the difference him Abraham's heart was when the word spoke Abraham from his heart was amen even when it required there was repentance that was required in Abraham's life he repented when the word corrected him and through that faithfulness under the word of God when he was wrong he was willing to repent when revealed here God it revealed then what God actually saw in Abraham I want to get to this this scripture here then as we look at it in the next part there of number or Nehemiah 9 verse 8 and I just just trying to draw from there I know I'm running short on time here but I just just trying to draw on to me is just such a lot that could be brought here but I'm only interested in what he wants to draw our attention to here because remember Abraham Abraham is regarded as the father of the faith is that right even where Paul would write that they which are of that same Faith are blessed with faithful Abraham here on the other side in this commentary not only God recognizing faithful but here on the other side in Galatians 3 it's recognized by the spirit of God Faithful Abraham how was Abraham able to be faithful because it was the faith of God moving upon Abraham's life that's why Paul could say we are of that same faith right that's the same Faith were to earnestly contend for it's God's life now I want you to notice this here here and gave us him the name Abraham and found now you know gave us him the name Abraham God put his own name on Abraham's name God removed the m and put his own name on is that right here and not only had God filled him imparted to him his life after God think of this God has called him into the land Abraham had a Disobedience he goes down into Egypt but here he comes back God speaks to him and says get back to the land why God is faithful to his word is that right my my let me finish I got to finish reading this scripture and then I can then I can preach that notice and found us his heart faithful before thee and made a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanites Hittites amorites parasites Champion sites gurga sites to give it I say to his seed and has performed thy words for thou art righteous now this is worship unto God what God said he performed now remember Abraham never saw this in his day but God said your seed will journey in a land for 400 years but I'll bring them out with a mighty hand is that right mountain when we look and we see all the way through Abram's life this is what I want to draw into and found us his heart faithful before him before thee and made a covenant with him God made a covenant with Abraham in Genesis 15. God confirmed it he showed he took Abram out of the picture takes man out of the picture and gone through all those sacrifices that little white light went right down through the midst of it God confirming this is what I am going to do look at this right after that chapter Here Comes Ishmael that's what I think what happened what happened but you see it shows this is like brother ram calls that of Ishmael he said we see that slight Interruption to the program of God but it's just like any other program if it's interrupted stay tuned it'll be continued [Music] [Applause] then no doubt you have had I have had in my life but this is not our program that's why we're not the workmanship of any man we are his workmanship we're not the Masterpiece of a church it's a masterpiece of God and God makes a man a masterpiece by his own life uniting with himself inside of that man so then it becomes one in Union and that's a masterpiece of God that's a signature addition and here God through it all here it comes in Genesis 17. I'm your sh you know I'm your portion God makes himself reveals himself as El shadiah the strength Giver God had to allow Abraham you can read it in the Book of Romans God allowed Abraham's strength to dry up in other words no more little ishmaels can come that's right God allowed it to dry up God allows things to get to the last to get to the weak spot to get to the place where it is no more can it be human instrumentality in it that's the same way that God is working with our lives and it's what do we do in that moment because that can be scary when we look at it and say what can I do right here but the greatest thing is in that moment is to trust in him who will not leave you trust in God who has brought you safe this far trust in him who has worked and has done a work in your life trust in him that's what God wants us to trust in when brother Branham would take that scripture in Genesis 12 and he picks it up in the greatest battle of her father fought and he says God is calling Abraham's seed to separate from all unbelief and he said to separate from seed taste fill smell here reasoning imagination conscience and he goes down through the line well what is it it's to separate from everything that we've ever known we've known our reasoning we've known imagination and friends we still have to battle it it doesn't mean the battles won't come but it means living oh God let us live free from our imagination well how can I can't stop the birds from coming in but you have the authority to blast them as they're coming by cast down every imagination and any reasoning that reasons against the word be against it it don't matter how good or how clear it works this is how the Seed of Abraham stands in the midst of Trials stands in the midst of tests why because it's not the DNA of a man we can go through Genesis and show you the DNA of Abram it's not strong DNA but we're talking about the DNA of almighty God we're talking about the predestinated plan of almighty God we're talking about the Lord God who said I Will Bless Thee I will do this I have already what does that do when that Revelation is striking the heart of the believer it brings rest it's bringing rest that's why the preaching of this Revelation is so important because it is a message of rest that's what the seventh seal is it's Christ Among Us it's a relaxing time not a relaxing in solemn but it's arresting in our souls it's arresting in him and who am I whom I know and whom I have believed and I am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I've committed unto him against that day it's resting in his work in our lives see we're not resting in what we saw on deep calls to deep or what we've heard on the tape but we've met that same God we've met that same God that's what this message came to bring to you and I that where veils of tradition was hiding God from the people but the message of the hour it loosens or breaks the veils that we can see God plainly and see that way back into the holiest of Holiness to see that way back into ground that we can stand as Sons and Daughters of God and to know that we're not standing there as Beggars we're not standing there as fees we're not thanking it robbery we are looking at the blood sacrifice that has went before us Worthy is the Lamb to receive richest Power Glory and Honor um can I have just a few more moments this scripture when it says and found us his heart faithful before thee and made a covenant with him that word found us there in the scripture you know sometimes when you look at things and you just wait and you say there's something there and then as I was looking at it before but then they came across here and this week I'm just just to the Lord begins to drop on your heart I said let me just let me look at that again oh and I'm looking and then the Holy Spirit just begin to Quicken some things on that and I'm don't worry I'm not going to preach any longer on it it's just a simple thought a point but and found us his heart faithful this word foundus means a covering like the covering of the skins of the Tabernacle it's covering that went over the ark but Samuel what is it thou found us his heart faithful God uncovered and let there be a display that would come on Mount Moriah all along here we see faithfulness that through the through all the wanderings through the ups the Downs through the Genesis 13 Genesis Genesis 16. here we have that even Abraham stand there in Genesis 17 and Abraham looks and God says you know because Abraham is convinced even in that in Genesis 17 think think of this think God has just filled him with his spirit and changed his name you see where we're at and even where we're at standing right there that's why this word the strength of el shadiah of Elohim is to take us Beyond human ability or the thought of it because Abraham's thought of human ability caused him to say oh that Ishmael might live before thee foreign God just acted like he didn't even say nothing went right over the top of it you ever felt that way sometimes and I just felt that way God just went right over the top of it oh yeah oh yeah but God lets him know but my seed was shall I asked my promise my Covenant shall I establish with Isaac that only God even gave him the name what was coming because Isaac means laughter and we're and where Abraham thought listen in Abraham's natural part oh we can see this here you find a faithful thou foundest his heart faithful it's not wrote right here in Nehemiah it's not wrote in Romans 4 in the Divine commentary that Abraham laughed it's not wrote there why because notice God looking upon the heart and God dealing with the heart it could not pass through the mercy see I can't do this with my Bible uh because I'm afraid of my Bible it will actually uh you know come apart because I've already got kind of loose but if I could hold this part up right here and hold these papers up right here that is between the Old Testament and New Testament you realize what was in the old could not pass through the blood and get to the new and that's why your name has been transferred from the old book into the new book [Music] [Applause] it can't pass through the blood well what passes through the blood well what comes out on the other side a son and daughter of God so what is actually mentioned by God is what was a Son of God is what was a daughter of God because the rest of it didn't matter it was growing pains Hallelujah God allows it for you and I that our Humanity that we're our thought of human ability and yourself brother Samuel I don't deal with that no more we do deal with that many times we still deal with it and that's the very thing that we must master and overcome continuously is the thought of human ability sometimes the thought of human ability is just doing about things that we can't do nothing about and if you just just wait on the Lord don't worry he'll tell you why don't you just commit it to me some things I had on my heart I was praying and praying and praying I'm hearing praying praying praying and here I am I'm just just sitting in a simple spot and you know I'm just praying and the Holy Spirit just dropped down right there and said why don't you just commit it to me and as soon as he said that I said forgive me Lord that's exactly right I committed to you but Samuel what was the result just from that moment burden lifted things didn't dry up or things didn't soared all the way out but it lifted and the confidence is he's in control committing it to him so God uncovered or was unveiling in Abraham's life himself I'm finished here brother Brown says it like this I'm going to close on this course outspoken word's Original Seed I just I just feel like that this is this is it right here brother Brian was dealing with the predestinated working of the Lord Jesus and he's talking about how Isaiah came as a predestinated witness and he said Jesus came for a witness of the death burial and resurrection that man will die but live again through him for he is the seed that has to come up and he said predestinated as he was makes the word seed flesh in you his church God's word predestinated as he was makes the word seed flesh in you his church God's word see that's why with the reality of predestination it's just simply establishing God's mind and God before the foundation of the world I was with God I was with God there's a and that's that's where the revelation of Jesus Christ makes that a living reality that's what the Holy Ghost comes to do it's the strength that comes into our lives to make that real to us so we've got a foundation that's not our efforts is that right sure brother Branham every word I believe it he said then don't back up when you get to your tradition stay with that word and stay with that and Watch What Happens say oh Lord I believe it send the Holy Spirit then watch then if he goes to bearing record then you know you got it not by some sensation because the Devils do that not by some miracle the Devils do that but by your constant belief in the word of God and the life that you live never denying nothing thank you faithful thou foundest his heart faithful that makes the word becoming fleshy flesh and the same water and spirit and he said Jesus was the Seed of Abraham fleshly speaking now just just watch this here he fleshly speaking a predestinated Seed of Abraham and when the spirit fell on him what kind of a life did he bring so he was a predestinated seat of Abraham of that Faith he brought a Faith Life what kind of a life and what shall build around says this you mean he's going to be a Sojourner like Abraham said that's where people get so mixed up today they try to think that a man of God has to do this and follow this and do that so you see what brother Brown he breaks in on that thought you mean he's going to be a Sojourner like Abraham in other words if we're a real Seed of Abraham we're going to buy a tent and just go around like nomads Abraham wasn't a nomad but you understand what I'm saying that's what brother Brahm is saying it's not us trying to be like someone else it's us yielding and Christ Living his life out through you and I that's the faith of Abraham it's not acting like this one or acting like that it was Christ in Elijah Christ in Moses Christ in job Christ in Moses none of them were the same you and I are not the same and God doesn't want us to be the same but what he does want is that be the same Christ in you and I the same life the same objective the same God the same purpose Christ in you and me the hope of glory God's interested not in reproducing a man he's interested in reproducing himself that's why Eve was given to Adam woo man that she would be that for Adam's image to be reproduced in and that's why Christ comes to the elected seed because the seed is that good ground that when the seed is sown it's a place where Christ can reflect himself through our lives so just as much as God founded Abraham's heart faithful that's the same thing that God is doing in the life of his people just as he took the seals off of himself he's taking the seals off of you he's uncovering now the rest of the world the arrest of the world the outside world says you're really no different yeah you're a pretty good guy you know you do this you don't do that you don't do they don't they don't know what's behind it all they see is that bad your skin as brother Jerry was preaching all they see is the covering that God sees behind the covering him and see whatever is behind the covering the glory of God is being veiled in your life then the works of God you do it comes out it's not something we're trying to do it's what God is doing through us do we have to give ourselves sure we have to give ourselves to God and God continues to mold and shape in our life I wish I could have really got to read Genesis 22 but we just we couldn't get there but just to refer to that God when it all was said and done and Abraham's hand was raised with that knife God the angel of the Lord spoke and said stay thy hand for now I know us that thou loveest me more than even thine only son what was on display what was it that was on display on Mount Moriah same Mountain where our Lord was crucified what was uncovered there the faithfulness of God what was uncovered in Abraham's life he found us his heart faithful what was it it was God's faithfulness all along and Abraham had received that faithfulness and walked by it is so molded his life God's faithfulness working through his life to where Abraham would be able to walk to that place of Mount Moriah to the place of rapture to the place of the body change without any torment of Genesis 16. without any torment of his failures of his mistakes how was that possible because God was faithful and he's faithful to you and me so when it's all said and done out of all of our lives the eulogy I know can be wrote in many many ways they can have we can have wrong eulogies but when it's all said and done it comes down to like God wrote it in Romans 4. and even in Romans 9. not all the in-between things because remember the prophet said it's what you do for the Lord that counts that's what matters in the end do we have to work yeah we have to work do we have to yeah we have to labor do we have to pay bills yes we have to pay bills do it yes yes yes yes all of that but when the commentary is all said and done there's not going to be one part there in that commentary outside of Christ himself being glorified there might be things that's mentioned about the job but to where that we stood for him pulled this way but we stood for him put him before other things but we'll certainly stand there on that day and say Lord it was because of your faithfulness not by works that I have done but your faithfulness Lord when I felt like giving up you were faithful to encourage me in the promises when I felt like I can't make another step you were faithful Lord Lord you remember that Thursday night you came along my way Lord you remember that night when you walked me and you spoke to me there Lord you remember Lord through that message Lord you are faithful and I'm standing here because of your faithfulness to your word that even when I was in despair even when I was indestruct you are faithful to your word it's his word inside of you and me God is faithful to his word listen why would you say that because if it's based on me if it's based on this I see no reason for him to be faithful here but when it comes to his word he's the god of his word [Applause] he's faithful to his word and they can say God by your grace I'm a part of that word Lord God it resonates in my heart there's an amen shall be it Lord a constant belief never denying nothing when the word shows along our pathway and there's something we can say Lord I'm deficient in that in my life but so be it Lord in my life what is it a constant belief never denying nothing be it unto me Lord God according to that word a seed of Abraham don't you love him Hallelujah oh when it's all said and done Just Give Me Jesus when it's all said and done brothers or sisters it might only be Brother Ray mine might only be a part it may it may be as short as Jesus wept that scripture but if it's him whatever it is it's him when it's all said and done like Abraham's commentary it's where Abraham was regarded as faithful if there's no other word that can be said about Samuel Browning I would say God granted with all my heart it's not I want to be that that you know that like we're trying to do something that you gave everything from me well I left out of here in last Last Friday morning because I was going along I began to think about the faithfulness of the Lord Jesus we had spoke on it but he was faithful in the midst of facing Calvary he was faithful weeping heard with strong crying and tears in that he feared but he was faithful it just it just rung my heart out there on Friday morning said oh God thank you for being for your faithfulness thank you for your faithfulness Lord he's been faithful and he is faithful don't you love him oh I just all I want to do with the musicians would come and we'd sing sing that song I know it's an old one maybe brother Brian has a different one but I think of that song all I want to do is love him so glad he gave his life for me Oh my he is worthy He's Worthy of our life he's worthy of all oh God he's worthy oh my how we just love the Lord let's just let's just ask the Lord's blessing here upon the word Heavenly Father thank you Lord for your mercy here tonight Lord Jesus thank you Lord for taking us Lord in this this pathway tonight this vain Lord oh God you know Lord you know what you're doing Lord I just Lord as these thoughts Lord I know there's a reason and a purpose Lord I know My Heart Lord has been encouraged tonight and I I pray that God that Lord the rest Lord of your children just drawing comfort from your word drawing comfort from you Lord oh God that Lord it's you at work Lord in our lives and we believe that but sometimes the lord it's things that seems so hard to see but God as we say Genesis 22. Lord we don't see that in Genesis 12. matter of fact back in Genesis 11 when the Lord had said unto Abram get thee out of the land of thy country but Lord you knew what was in Abraham you knew Lord when that scripture when it says God the Lord did tempt in Genesis 22 that word tempt is the word in the Hebrew that it's to a say which means as they drill into the Earth and take out a core sample to determine is there precious or and medals beneath the surface Lord you wanted to show not only what was the neighbor's heart but what was in your heart and we look at that scripture and as we're standing here and we see Genesis 22. that's a bride promised scripture Lord that's a scripture Lord where what's being brought out of our life it's Christ it's us the Lord becoming one becoming one with you Lord recognize it's you it's you that's working through all of these tests through these trials that you permit in your infinite wisdom to come our way Lord granted that our hearts Lord remaining loyal in the midst of these times Lord through that loyalty give you praise Lord to stand steadfast in the word of God and Lord through it Lord calling out to you oh it's Lord sometimes Lord as we go through this I know that I'm a speaking Lord to Believers that sometimes lord it's it's where we're wrestling and out it's where we're Lord we're crying out to you o God Lord I Need Your Mercy Lord I Need Your Grace Lord Lord we need you to move Lord for this need oh God it's through those moments Lord that it's where it's dissolving of us and that character is being molded Lord

of travel I see so many times oh yes yes and if there's one thing that I've learned in my life it's my redeemer is faithful and true [Music] My Redeemer and true true oh yes everything is [Music] every morning 's mercies are new yes Lord my redeemer is playful and true my heart rejoices when I read the promise there is a place I am preparing for you I know I know someday I'll see my Lord face

true [Music] [Applause] [Music] every morning his mercies are new [Applause] my redeemer is true [Music] aren't you glad just as God was with Abraham God's with you through every place that's been traversed I come back to this scripture being confident of this one thing he that begun the good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ it's God at work I wonder if it had been you or I remember how brother Branham talks about he says he says if it was me he says and I gave you my word and you said ah I don't know he said if it was me he said I'd say well if you can't take my word he said but not God he said God [Music] puts ministering gifts he said to go in there and that God works for that gift to raise our faith in his word that he said is God's love gifts see God knows even think think about this at times it's sometimes where we're at like where Abraham was sometimes looking at situations that are before us listen the gift is not man it's God gift is to get ourselves out of the way that God is present so then our faith is lifted in God when you looked and I looked and see there's no way I don't see a way through this but God comes and here we are looking at the word but then God will come just like he did to Abraham and he lifts our faith you walk out of a service and you're strengthened you're encouraged you you you you you get up from praying or you know from where you've been sitting praying laying whatever and you and you walk out and you're there's encouragement where did that come from it came from almighty God because I just say friends a man to a man we love one another but it takes more than a man's word to encourage us because if that be sold it could be me just trying to brother Shane just trying to convince you or brother Brian trying to convince you that's not what the ministering of the word's about not trying to convince Us in that way just lift him up let him be lifted up because in him all things are finished we can see he is my victory he is my peace so then we come out with a renewed vision it's God as it was through Abraham where Abraham's seed my it's God walking right here with us sure God brings correction to our life aren't you glad for that that's God's faithfulness God's a faithful parent to correct us all of those things along the way but God is faithful and it's his faithfulness his faithfulness to his word that what we saw on Mount Moriah is reflected in Abraham's life it come to such a place to where Abraham's life you would just Christ on display I say go God lead me there Lord hey lead me there to where it's just Christ Alone to wear like Mount Transfiguration experience where they saw no man save Jesus only that's a placing of sons oh God let it be don't you love him tonight Heavenly Father thank you Lord for your word tonight thank you for your mercy oh God we just appreciate you Lord so much Lord I don't even I feel like Lord there's words to describe it thank you Lord thank you Lord for your faithfulness to us Lord a little little part of the Bride around the world thank you for your faithfulness Lord faithfulness Lord administering to our lives not just here on Thursday and Sunday but oh God daily walking with us Lord oh God that's this is our desire Lord through everything Lord when it's all said and done that God when that commentary is written found us his heart faithful granted Lord we pray we love you tonight Lord may you go with your children watch over up on the roads we pray in the precious name of Jesus Christ [Music] oh Jesus [Music] through it all
