[12:39] Why should I [singing] worry? Praise
[12:42] God. Praise God.
[12:46] You know, as far as the situations in
[12:47] life, sometimes we do have things to
[12:49] worry about. When we think about who's
[12:51] in control,
[12:53] &gt;&gt; the words of the song come, "Why should
[12:55] I worry? Why should I fear? Jesus is
[12:58] always near. He's always there to save
[13:01] us." Yes. Thank you, Lord.
[13:07] I think so, Lord.
[13:10] Out on the waterers,
[13:14] the storms raging high. [singing]
[13:18] The waters [music] around them had
[13:23] troubled [singing]
[13:24] their lives.
[13:26] [music]
[13:27] Fear filled their hearts
[13:31] and they thought [singing] they would
[13:33] die.
[13:35] But they failed to remember
[13:40] the master [music and singing]
[13:41] was not.
[13:44] He spoke the word
[13:48] and the winds [music] all [singing]
[13:50] stood still.
[13:53] Even the waters
[13:57] [music] obeyed [singing]
[13:58] his will.
[14:01] And he conquers source [music]
[14:05] just like he will mine. Help me Jesus if
[14:10] I just remember
[14:14] that he [music and singing] lives
[14:15] inside.
[14:18] So why should I [singing]
[14:21] free?
[14:23] Why should [music] I fear
[14:26] when the very same Jesus [music]
[14:31] is always near? [singing and music]
[14:35] He lives in my heart
[14:39] and he hears when [music and singing] I
[14:41] cry. Hallelujah. I call on his name
[14:48] till the storm passes
[14:49] [music and singing]
[14:50] by.
[14:53] Oh, praise his holy name. Praise God. I
[14:57] read in [singing] the Bible.
[15:01] He walked [singing and music] with them,
[15:05] brought light to their darkness
[15:09] when the way grew dear.
[15:14] How great it would be
[15:16] [music and singing]
[15:17] to have his steps leading mine
[15:22] and to walk with [music and singing] the
[15:24] master
[15:27] all of the time.
[15:31] When trials [music and singing]
[15:32] come
[15:35] and death is so not, [music]
[15:39] I'll just search [singing] for the
[15:41] master.
[15:43] I know he'll be right
[15:44] [music and singing] on time.
[15:48] When I'm in trouble, [music and singing]
[15:52] my body's in pain.
[15:56] All I [music] have to do
[16:00] is call on his name.
[16:04] Oh, why should I worry?
[16:08] Why should I fear? [music]
[16:12] For this very same Jesus,
[16:16] he's always here.
[16:20] [music]
[16:21] He lives in my heart [singing]
[16:24] and [music] he hears when I cry.
[16:29] I call on [singing and music] his name
[16:33] till the storm passes by.
[16:37] So why should I [singing] worry?
[16:42] Why should I fear? [singing]
[16:46] Oh, this very same [music] Jesus.
[16:50] He's always near. Thank you, Lord. He
[16:55] stays in [singing] my heart [music]
[16:58] and he hears when I cry.
[17:03] Call on his [singing and music] name

[35:21] I give my mind
[35:26] completely to you,
[35:30] Lord. [music]
[35:32] Fill me with your thoughts. [snorts]

[35:41] Change my life.
[35:44] [music]
[35:45] Oh, let me live [singing] in all that's
[35:50] true. [music]
[35:53] I just want to think like
[35:57] you.
[36:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord Jesus.
[36:08] Amen.
[36:10] Let's just go to him in a word of prayer
[36:11] tonight.
[36:13] And maybe as we approach in prayer
[36:15] tonight, I had had a text here from
[36:18] brother Barry Coffee here just [music]
[36:20] um a couple hours ago that
[36:24] um with the saints there in Tanzania,
[36:26] you'd get a text from brother Leas
[36:28] that's over there, a pastor, and um
[36:32] there's just been some real political
[36:34] unrest with some things that's taken
[36:36] place. A lot of violence has just just
[36:39] happened within
[36:41] within the day. And so um there the
[36:44] brothers are requesting prayer. Um also
[36:49] with
[36:51] the hurricane that had come through
[36:53] Jamaica,
[36:55] I was in contact with brother Keith
[36:56] Reed. Um I was in contact with him as it
[37:01] was coming in and then uh he sent me
[37:04] some videos and things even as it was
[37:06] going on and um so he's there still
[37:09] trying to assess the damages and so uh
[37:12] of what's taking place you know there um
[37:16] so you know communication some of you no
[37:18] doubt most of you probably heard within
[37:21] that the most the communication is down
[37:23] so it's very difficult to try to hear
[37:25] even the same way in Tanzania because of
[37:27] all the not because the hurricane but
[37:30] because the political unrest the the
[37:32] only way they can make contact is
[37:34] through cell phone and so it's it's a
[37:37] lot of things that's that's taking place
[37:39] and you see the
[37:41] the world is in such a turmoil
[37:45] &gt;&gt; you know we one thing about it as
[37:47] believers we we can't we can't just look
[37:51] and see the things that's taking place
[37:54] and realize that it's going home time.
[37:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is.
[37:59] &gt;&gt; You know, I I couldn't help myself just
[38:01] a couple weeks ago [music] when
[38:04] everything was being touted about a
[38:07] great peace plan. And you know, the
[38:10] scripture just months just the scripture
[38:12] just have been going through my mind for
[38:14] months is when they begin to say peace
[38:18] then sudden destruction.
[38:22] &gt;&gt; And I'm not putting any timeline. I'm
[38:23] just trying to say is that there [music]
[38:25] is
[38:26] a thing a lot of things that people are
[38:28] putting their stock in and they're
[38:32] looking for. We see I mean even where
[38:34] our president uh and when he says
[38:37] something he does it
[38:39] um but testing now nuclear weapons.
[38:44] Yeah,
[38:45] &gt;&gt; you see the world's the tensions are
[38:48] bracing and uh we certainly know that
[38:52] what a time it is to be in Christ.
[38:57] &gt;&gt; What a what a place of safety, [music]
[38:59] you know, because just at any moment
[39:00] because we know that we have this
[39:02] promise that if we're that close and we
[39:04] see those things that before one bomb
[39:08] &gt;&gt; strikes this,
[39:10] &gt;&gt; the bride's already gone.
[39:13] The bride's already gone
[39:17] &gt;&gt; before one one bomb strikes it.
[39:20] &gt;&gt; The prophet tells us very clearly that
[39:22] the dead in Christ will rise
[39:25] &gt;&gt; and we will be gathered right here. But
[39:27] here we are walking in another
[39:28] dimension. But yet here we are for that
[39:31] period of 30 to 40 days.
[39:34] And that's the same way it was in the
[39:36] book of acts. But you know, brother Bram
[39:37] says the reason also that that is is
[39:41] because he knows
[39:43] before he appears, we're going to be
[39:46] looking around to see who made it.
[39:49] And he said he don't want any eyes taken
[39:51] off of him when he appears.
[39:54] So within that 30 to 40 days and think
[39:56] how close we are within those times and
[40:00] you know [music]
[40:02] what what a shalom it is in our hearts
[40:06] &gt;&gt; and you know I believe with all my heart
[40:08] that you know God give us the wisdom
[40:12] &gt;&gt; give us the grace to reach others.
[40:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. May it may there be such a sound
[40:20] that goes out of our life that's greater
[40:22] than [music] any words that we could
[40:23] say.
[40:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Let's just pray together
[40:27] tonight and pray for these needs here
[40:29] for the brothers and brethren in
[40:30] Tanzania and Jamaica. And
[40:34] heavenly father,
[40:36] we are so thankful God for your mercy in
[40:39] this hour.
[40:43] &gt;&gt; We didn't find you. You found us.
[40:48] Lord, if not for your grace,
[40:52] we would also be groping in darkness.
[40:56] Lord, we see the nervous tensions
[41:01] &gt;&gt; there in the world. We see, oh God, just
[41:04] where man's heart is perplexed with
[41:06] fear. We see the
[41:08] Lord, many of the attributes of that,
[41:10] Lord, just oh God, everything all around
[41:12] us. No, no settleness, no peace Lord.
[41:16] and so many things to Lord that are
[41:18] either taken or or viewed or so forth to
[41:22] try to drown out that real cry for peace
[41:27] in the heart of man. That's where your
[41:30] desire is to bring real peace to you,
[41:32] Lord. Because through that peace
[41:35] reigning in our hearts, you're making a
[41:37] people that are fitted and ready, Lord
[41:40] God. For there is coming a time,
[41:43] &gt;&gt; Lord, in that great millennium, when
[41:45] there will be peace
[41:48] when the knowledge of the Lord shall
[41:50] fill the earth, sea, and sky,
[41:54] oh God, a people that you have redeemed.
[41:57] You have taken unto us. You have taken
[42:00] us unto yourself. And God, molding us
[42:03] and preparing us, Lord. Even now, we're
[42:05] being prepared and molded, Lord, for
[42:08] that moment, for that time. Oh, Father,
[42:12] as we stand here, Lord, every one of us,
[42:15] undoubtedly, Lord, we have loved ones on
[42:18] our heart. Lord, whether it be parents,
[42:22] whether it be children, whether it be
[42:23] extended family, co-workers, oh God, we
[42:27] don't want to see one miss it, Lord.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:33] So Lord,
[42:35] let our lives
[42:38] be so seasoned with you.
[42:43] that are that every moment through every
[42:46] action
[42:48] and the wisdom Lord for the words to be
[42:50] spoken that God just to be in this
[42:53] season in this moment Lord to to catch
[43:00] those Lord Jesus
[43:02] Lord of wandering souls hearts and lives
[43:06] Lord oh God maybe it's even to catch one
[43:09] that their eyes won't even Lord they'll
[43:12] they'll never be able to see fully the
[43:14] truth, but they'll accept the salvation
[43:16] of the Lord.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; Oh God,
[43:20] help us, Lord.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; Help us, Father. I pray in these
[43:26] moments, Lord. We just want to be
[43:29] vessels
[43:30] that are emptied, surrendered, and
[43:33] yielded. Lord, that you might work your
[43:37] will through our lives. Lord, help us,
[43:40] Lord.
[43:42] For it can even be the testimony through
[43:44] our lives that would reach someone else,
[43:45] Lord, of how that we will handle
[43:48] something or respond to something on the
[43:50] job. And we know that Lord, that's not a
[43:53] little thing. That's supernaturally that
[43:55] you working in our lives just like you
[43:58] did in the field with the bull with the
[44:00] prophet and the maniac on the stage and
[44:02] the hornets there in the yard. It was a
[44:04] supernatural work that took place, Lord.
[44:07] And may our lives, oh God,
[44:11] be that platform that would invite you
[44:13] to step forth. Lord, help us.
[44:17] &gt;&gt; Lord, we pray for the brethren there in
[44:20] Tanzania. Lord,
[44:22] &gt;&gt; oh God,
[44:24] would you just, Lord, just undertake for
[44:27] them? I pray that God you would just
[44:30] settle those things Lord as [music] you
[44:32] keep your hand upon the brethren Lord
[44:35] and the churches around oh God
[44:39] protect them Lord we Lord it's not hard
[44:41] for us to ask that because you said Lord
[44:44] you'd be a wall of protection around us
[44:46] Lord
[44:48] a wall of fire
[44:51] that we ask Lord for the brothers and
[44:53] sisters in Jamaica oh God brother Keith
[44:55] Reid and many the other brothers Lord
[44:57] Lord, oh God, may you just, Lord, I
[45:01] pray, undertake for them, Lord, give
[45:05] them strength, Lord, and encouragement,
[45:08] Lord. Father, as we're able to even
[45:11] help, Lord, I pray, oh God, Lord Jesus,
[45:14] there's not one assembly that could,
[45:16] Lord, take care of everything, but may
[45:19] you take, Lord, and multiply, oh God, to
[45:23] minister to the needs of your children.
[45:26] We just Lord, we love you in our hearts,
[45:29] Lord.
[45:31] We know, we sense it, Lord. It's going
[45:34] on time,
[45:36] &gt;&gt; every moment, Lord. So, Lord, we just
[45:40] commit this service in your hands and
[45:41] ask that
[45:43] &gt;&gt; draw us closer to you, Lord.
[45:46] Prepare us, Lord. I pray in Jesus name.
[45:51] Amen and amen.
[45:54] [snorts] Amen. Hallelujah.
[46:00] Amen.
[46:02] So good to be here in the house of the
[46:04] Lord. And
[46:06] Amen. Good to have our brother here with
[46:07] us. God bless you.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:11] Amen. I forgot your name. What was your
[46:13] name? Aquilla. God bless you, brother
[46:16] Aquilla. You know, he was here when
[46:18] brother Marcus was here and so so
[46:22] [snorts] glad to have him.
[46:24] How are you related to brother John
[46:26] Singer?
[46:27] You're not. Shame on you. No, I'm just
[46:30] teasing. But you aren't you from the
[46:32] assembly over there? Are you from the
[46:34] assembly over there? Okay.
[46:36] So, I I didn't know if you were related
[46:39] to him or not. I I don't probably Nobody
[46:42] wants to be related to Brother John.
[46:44] Don't tell him I said that.
[46:47] We think of one another. But, Brother
[46:48] John's a fine brother. You have a fine
[46:50] assembly over there. Brother David is a
[46:53] pastor and we [snorts] want to read here
[46:55] in the scripture. Um, and I know we've
[46:58] been reading these scriptures here and I
[46:59] want to just go a little further this
[47:01] evening.
[47:02] Jesus said, "A new commandment I give
[47:05] unto you that you love one another as I
[47:09] have loved you, that you also love one
[47:12] another. And by this shall all men know
[47:18] that you are my disciples
[47:20] if you have love one to another.
[47:25] I want you to think about that here. He
[47:27] is the living word made manifest. So
[47:30] this isn't it. This isn't a love that
[47:34] can actually be expressed
[47:37] uh outside of the love of God dwelling
[47:40] in the heart of the believer. which is
[47:44] the Holy Spirit.
[47:46] And it won't be apart from the word, but
[47:49] as a life is walking in the word.
[47:53] Walking in the light, this is an
[47:56] accompaniment. If we're walking in that
[47:59] light is that the love of God will be
[48:03] the accompaniment with the revelation
[48:05] that we hold in our heart. And so if if
[48:08] we hold uh revelation but don't hold
[48:12] love, then it's not revelation, it's
[48:15] knowledge.
[48:17] &gt;&gt; And so because revelation is that wisdom
[48:20] that comes from above and it's full,
[48:23] it's pure and it's full of mercy.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; It's full of love. See that? That's why
[48:28] revelation is it it gives to us what we
[48:32] have need of. Yeah,
[48:33] &gt;&gt; it not only opens our understanding but
[48:35] it imparts to us what we need. It
[48:38] quickens us. It alerts us to the word
[48:40] and then it here we are drawn and it's
[48:42] then not us doing it but it's the word
[48:44] now coming through our lives.
[48:47] &gt;&gt; So in John 15:17
[48:50] these things I command you that ye love
[48:56] one another.
[48:58] Amen. May God bless you and bless the
[49:00] reading of the word as you're being
[49:01] seated.
[49:03] Um,
[49:05] I want to um
[49:09] just speak here just tonight on on the
[49:12] thought here just for a few moments on
[49:16] that of
[49:18] u of brotherly love
[49:26] and brotherly love. I realized that this
[49:29] is a this just even in this um subject
[49:34] itself um could really merit even a lot
[49:38] of services and a lot of things. But I
[49:41] want to I want to start back in with
[49:44] looking at how that this when this is
[49:46] given in the word and to understand that
[49:49] anything that God requires of us in the
[49:52] word and what he's when he spoke to the
[49:54] disciples and he spoke to them and he
[49:57] said that we are to love one another as
[50:00] I have loved you. It's absolutely
[50:03] impossible without his love dwelling in
[50:08] us. and we dwelling in them. That's it's
[50:11] absolutely impossible because this love
[50:14] this degree is God himself. God is love.
[50:19] And so to to understand as when we see
[50:23] this here with with that of of brotherly
[50:26] love, it's something that God himself
[50:28] when his life comes into us, it's his
[50:31] life that then produces what what is
[50:36] actually being called for. So it will
[50:38] actually produce this of brotherly love.
[50:41] The prophet says it like this. He says
[50:43] the first thing that Pentecost produced
[50:46] was brotherly love. So miracles and
[50:51] signs and wonders those are
[50:52] accompaniment but I want you to remember
[50:54] that they're they're even the nominal
[50:58] world they have miracles they have signs
[51:01] they have wonders we don't downplay that
[51:03] but the Bible says miracle signs and
[51:05] wonders follow the believer and so this
[51:08] is why that we don't rest upon signs and
[51:12] wonders and no matter how marvelously
[51:14] God could use you or use anyone else we
[51:18] ultim ultimately is to rest upon the
[51:20] word of God.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; And so when we look at this that
[51:24] Pentecost, the first thing it produced
[51:26] was brotherly love. So it wasn't a group
[51:28] of people that were somehow trying to
[51:32] mirror what the Lord Jesus had called
[51:35] for, but it's what they yielded to, and
[51:38] it was now Christ working out that same
[51:41] love in their lives as he had towards
[51:44] them. Now, it says it tore down. I I
[51:47] love how brother Bram writes this. He
[51:49] says, "It tore down the middle wall of
[51:52] partitions and it made a brotherhood to
[51:55] such that they had everything in common
[51:58] in the Bible days a brotherhood." It did
[52:01] that. Not it wasn't something that they
[52:03] themselves
[52:05] altogether had to do, but it's what it
[52:07] did through their lives to where when we
[52:10] talk about walls being torn down, the
[52:12] world the reality of where walls must be
[52:15] torn down is from the heart.
[52:17] &gt;&gt; That's where love is to dwell. And
[52:19] that's where love dissolves walls. It
[52:22] dissolves separation. That's what
[52:24] brought God down to us. And this is what
[52:27] brought to where that even as he would
[52:29] walk with the disciples, his love for
[52:32] them. He had a love for them that at
[52:34] that time they were not able to receive
[52:37] that love and to respond back to that
[52:39] love because the blood had not been shed
[52:42] yet. But once the blood had been shed to
[52:44] take care of the sin, then vessels could
[52:48] be opened, surrendered, and the love of
[52:50] God could be poured into their lives.
[52:53] and then they could love him as he loved
[52:56] them.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; So now notice within this the prophet
[53:01] goes on to say Paul spoke of this
[53:03] brotherhood and he gave all the gifts of
[53:05] the Pentecostal church and he said in 1
[53:08] Corinthians 13 though I speak with
[53:10] tongues as men and angels and have not
[53:12] this love which brings the brotherhood
[53:15] I'm nothing. And though I have the
[53:16] knowledge to understand all the
[53:18] mysteries of God, I am still nothing
[53:20] without love. the love of the brethren.
[53:24] So, brother Abraham goes on to say,
[53:26] "This will all men know that you're my
[53:30] disciples when you have love one for the
[53:32] other." So, I want you to understand
[53:34] that people can look and they can try to
[53:37] classify you and say, "What do you
[53:39] believe?" And then you begin to speak
[53:41] and talk a little bit and then
[53:43] eventually if they have any knowledge or
[53:46] anything at all, they'll say, "What what
[53:48] do you mean you you you follow a
[53:50] message?" and they're and they're
[53:51] wanting to try to place you. This is why
[53:53] many times individuals ask, "Uh, what
[53:56] church? What what what denomination are
[53:58] you a part of?" And you say, "I'm not a
[53:59] part of a denomination. I I'm I I'm just
[54:02] I'm just a Christian. I'm a I'm a member
[54:04] of the body of Jesus Christ." But
[54:07] they're trying to place you. And then if
[54:10] if you know that sometimes where
[54:12] individuals say, "Oh, oh, you know, oh,
[54:14] you you follow uh uh William Brandham's
[54:17] teachings. Oh, you and and they and you
[54:20] know and there might have been some
[54:22] interactions that they had with
[54:24] individuals that actually were followers
[54:28] and I want to use that loosely,
[54:30] followers of the message. And because
[54:32] they had interaction, but yet to them
[54:35] what they saw and so forth, it it had
[54:39] nothing within it that would prick their
[54:41] hearts or maybe STIR THEM UP. BUT THIS
[54:44] is what makes a difference is when we
[54:47] have the love of the truth.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S THE HOLY GHOST. THAT'S the
[54:54] seal of God. That's where the deception
[54:57] has come even within as as it speaks
[55:01] there in 1 Thessalonians 4 is to where
[55:04] that many having RECEIVED NOT the love
[55:07] of the truth. There they they have
[55:10] they've received a truth. Remember the
[55:12] Bible says in the last days how many
[55:15] will continue to wi with truth and and
[55:18] constantly just truth and truth but not
[55:20] receiving the love of it. And I can tell
[55:22] you this right here to know truth is a
[55:25] wonderful thing but really to really
[55:27] know truth is to know the person of
[55:30] Jesus CHRIST FOR HE IS THE TRUTH.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; HE'S the one that makes the word live.
[55:35] He's the one THAT MAKES IT ACT. He's the
[55:37] one that makes it do what he said do.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; And so when we see that the love of the
[55:44] truth, that's why when God moves into a
[55:46] heart and moves into a life fully, I
[55:49] mean, even as God begins to take a hold
[55:51] of a life, there begins to be a love
[55:53] affair that is started. AND THAT LOVE,
[55:55] IT JUST MOVES to a TO A DEEPER DEGREE to
[55:58] where like the prophet said, one of the
[56:00] greatest evidences 64 question answers,
[56:02] he said, IS WHERE SOMEONE YOU JUST SO
[56:05] LOVE THE WORD OF GOD. YOU SO LOVE THE
[56:08] WORD. You so LOVE THE TRUTH. AND NOT
[56:10] JUST LIKING IT AS far as it's
[56:12] stimulating your mind, BUT YOU LOVE IT.
[56:14] YOU WANT TO GIVE YOURSELF TO IT. YOU YOU
[56:16] WANT YOUR LIFE TO BE ADHERED TO IT. YOU
[56:18] YOU WANT YOU WANT YOUR LIFE TO MATCH
[56:20] THAT WORD. WHAT AN EVIDENCE.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE IT'S ABIDE THE LOVE
[56:25] OF TRUTH IS ABIDING IN YOUR HEART. YOUR
[56:28] DESIRE IS to please him.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; So how the brother Ram says Pentecost
[56:35] had that I'm speaking Pentecost meaning
[56:38] the first group of the apostles and the
[56:40] disciples they had that brotherly love.
[56:43] They wasn't greedy. They sold everything
[56:46] they had for the furthering of the
[56:48] church. They were so together till even
[56:51] when one heard the other died, they
[56:54] said, "Let us go and die with him."
[56:58] &gt;&gt; SUCH a feeling.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; Now, what produced that was the love of
[57:05] God in their lives. THEY HAD SIGNS. THEY
[57:09] HAD WONDERS. They had ALL OF THOSE
[57:10] THINGS. AND ALL OF THAT WILL COME IN ITS
[57:12] SEASON. AND IT COMES IT AS YOU KNOW,
[57:15] IT'S ON AS NEED. GOD GOD DOESN'T THE
[57:18] PROPHET TELLS US OVER AND OVER GOD
[57:19] DOESN'T CLOWN FOR nobody
[57:23] &gt;&gt; when there's A NEED LOOK EVERY TIME WHEN
[57:25] THE THIRD PULL WAS MANIFESTED THERE YOU
[57:28] FIND WITH SISTER HADTIE YOU FIND with
[57:30] with with with with WITH SISTER MEDIA
[57:33] YOU FIND THAT THERE WAS A NEED IN
[57:35] EVERYDAY [screaming] LIFE
[57:39] &gt;&gt; AND GOD WAS SHOWING I'M NOT JUST GOD OF
[57:42] THE PLATFORM
[57:44] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT JUST GOD OF THE FIRST AND SECOND
[57:46] PULL, BUT I'M GOD OF THE THIRD
[57:48] [screaming] PULL. AND THAT'S CHRIST IN
[57:50] you
[57:52] &gt;&gt; working through your life
[57:54] &gt;&gt; as needs arise in your life.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; It's you walking with God and God
[57:59] walking in you.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; What a what a wonderful reality. That's
[58:05] that's that's why the third pole is not
[58:08] a mysterious re not a mysterious thing.
[58:10] It's simply Christ himself now working
[58:12] preeminently in our lives. the word
[58:15] having preeminence, our lives being
[58:18] surrendered to him. So notice he says
[58:21] for the furthering of the church they
[58:22] were sewed together to even when one
[58:24] heard the other died they said let us go
[58:26] and die with him. Such a feeling
[58:29] timeested faith. Brother Bram said God
[58:32] is love and you just can't do nothing
[58:34] but love when God comes into you.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; It's love brotherly love for one
[58:40] another.
[58:42] You see this is why the think about
[58:44] these statements now when brother
[58:47] Brandham makes the statement in Christ
[58:48] the mystery of God REVEALED IF THE LOVE
[58:51] OF GOD IS IN YOUR HEART
[58:53] &gt;&gt; you can't wait for those church doors to
[58:55] OPEN
[58:56] &gt;&gt; TO GET IN HERE AND FELLOWSHIP WITH YOUR
[58:59] BROTHERS AND sisters
[59:02] &gt;&gt; but see WHAT IT'S COMING BACK TO IF THE
[59:04] LOVE OF GOD IS IN THERE NOW I DON'T SAY
[59:06] THAT A PERSON MIGHT NOT you know get out
[59:09] of sorts and whatever more but I'm
[59:11] telling you if the LOVE OF GOD IS IN
[59:13] YOUR HEART, HE WILL CORRECT YOU AND
[59:16] BRING YOU BACK TO THE FOLD.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; THAT BECAUSE THE LOVE OF GOD CAN'T FAIL.
[59:22] THAT THE CHARITY NEVER FAILETH.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; Is that right? When it anchors IN THERE,
[59:28] IT CAN'T FAIL.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; AND SO WHEN WE SEE THIS, THIS IS ONE OF
[59:33] THE REALITIES. IT'S THAT A PERSON CANNOT
[59:35] SAY, "OH, I JUST LOVE GOD SO MUCH, BUT I
[59:37] CAN'T STAND TO BE AROUND THOSE PEOPLE.
[59:39] SOMETHING'S WRONG." THAT'S RIGHT.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; SOMETHING'S WRONG.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; WELL, I JUST CAN'T STAND TO BE AROUND
[59:45] CHURCH PEOPLE. SOMETHING'S WRONG.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; IT'S A REAL SIGN OF A LACK OF THE LOVE
[59:50] OF GOD.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; IT'S A SIGN THAT WHERE IS THE HOLY
[59:54] SPIRIT?
[59:57] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? YOU COULD BECAUSE THIS
[59:59] IS WHAT THE HOLY SPIRIT PRODUCES A
[1:00:02] BROTHERHOOD, A BROTHERLY LOVE. IT'S NOT
[1:00:04] A GROUP OF PEOPLE. IT'S NOT US GETTING
[1:00:06] TOGETHER AROUND OUR OWN LITTLE IDEA
[1:00:08] having our own little click, our own
[1:00:10] little clan, our own little ism, our own
[1:00:13] little for US FOR AND NO MORE, OUR OWN.
[1:00:15] THAT'S NOT US. IT'S NOT OUR DOING.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE LORD'S DOING.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; AND IT IS MARVELOUS IN OUR OWN EYES. HOW
[1:00:26] GOD COULD TAKE A PEOPLE THAT ARE SO
[1:00:29] DIFFERENT, A PEOPLE THAT TEMPERAMENTS
[1:00:32] ARE SO DIFFERENT. HOW GOD CAN TAKE A
[1:00:34] PEOPLE FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE AND GOD
[1:00:37] BRINGS THOSE PEOPLE TOGETHER, BUT IT'S
[1:00:39] NOT ABOUT ALL OF THOSE OUTER THINGS.
[1:00:42] IT'S ABOUT THAT ATTRIBUTE THAT IS
[1:00:44] ACTUALLY A SON AND DAUGHTER OF GOD ON
[1:00:47] THE INSIDE. AND GOD WILL TAKE THAT
[1:00:50] ATTRIBUTE AND DRAW THAT AND QUICKEN THAT
[1:00:53] ATTRIBUTE TO BRING FORTH A SON AND
[1:00:55] DAUGHTER OF GOD. And then through the
[1:00:58] humanity
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; manifest his glory and his overcoming
[1:01:04] even through the rubbing
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; of one another.
[1:01:14] This is why Paul would write in 1
[1:01:16] Thessalonians 4:9 as touching brotherly
[1:01:19] love. You need not that I write unto
[1:01:21] you.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; Now, did Paul deal with with love? Yeah.
[1:01:25] Paul didn't Paul's not saying here,
[1:01:27] well, there's no need to even even to
[1:01:29] write about love. He wrote and as God
[1:01:32] would direct him not only within the
[1:01:35] Corinthian church, but Paul would
[1:01:38] admonish in this verse of scripture that
[1:01:41] you would also increase more and more.
[1:01:43] AND IN 2 THESSALONIANS, HE COMMENDS THEM
[1:01:46] FOR THE increase of the love from
[1:01:49] Thessalonians 1 to Thessalonians 2.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; So our love, the love of God in us, I
[1:01:55] mean, say it that way, can increase.
[1:01:58] Right?
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; You see, it's taking every every bit of
[1:02:02] the of of the boundaries that belong to
[1:02:05] you as a son and daughter of God. GOD'S
[1:02:07] INTERESTED IN OCCUPYING IT ALL. God's
[1:02:10] not we're not interested and neither is
[1:02:12] God interested in just giving us OUR
[1:02:14] INHERITANCE, BUT HE'S INTERESTED in us
[1:02:17] filling that inheritance in that we
[1:02:19] ourselves are ARE PARTAKERS OF THAT
[1:02:22] inheritance to its fullness of what he's
[1:02:24] called us to
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; in this hour. In other words, God did
[1:02:28] not give you, let's say, this whole
[1:02:29] building and wants you to stay in that
[1:02:31] corner.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; He wants to fill.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; He want He wants you He wants you to
[1:02:36] possess the land. And and THE THINGS
[1:02:37] THAT YOU'RE POSSESSING HERE IN THE LAND
[1:02:40] ARE THINGS OF OF COMPLEXES that will
[1:02:42] rise. MAYBE THINGS THAT HAVE EXISTED IN
[1:02:44] YOUR LIFE, THINGS THAT strange from THE
[1:02:46] FAMILY, BUT NONE NEEDLESS TO SAY, THIS
[1:02:49] IS YOUR INHERITANCE, AND THOSE THINGS
[1:02:52] are only trespassing. Amen.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So that's touching brotherly
[1:03:01] love. You need not that I write unto you
[1:03:03] for yourselves are taught of God to love
[1:03:06] one another. Not only did God lay it
[1:03:08] down within the word, but even how he
[1:03:11] came to us, EVEN HIS APPROACH to us.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; We were unloly,
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; BUT HE CAME TO US.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. HOW MANY CAN YOU EVEN LOOK
[1:03:21] AT AND SAY, "WELL, MY MY GOODNESS, YOU
[1:03:23] KNOW, UH, here a prayer request." And
[1:03:25] yet, maybe it's a prayer request, and
[1:03:27] yet someone IS NOT REALLY ADAMANT ABOUT
[1:03:29] SERVING GOD. HEY, PRAY FOR ME. What are
[1:03:31] you What are you going to do? Are you
[1:03:32] going to tell your loved ones? Well,
[1:03:33] we're not going to pray for you. You
[1:03:34] need to get in church.
[1:03:39] AS THOUGH THAT THAT'S GOING TO WIN THEM.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; LET ME TELL YOU WHAT'S GOING TO WIN them
[1:03:44] is THE LOVE OF GOD.
[1:03:46] AND NO, THE LOVE OF GOD IS NOT
[1:03:48] COMPROMISING. BUT NEITHER IS THE LOVE OF
[1:03:51] GOD BRISTLING,
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; SHARP,
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; DEGRADING,
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; cutting down. No, no, that's not the
[1:03:58] love of God.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; That's human frustration.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; That's human dominion wanting to take
[1:04:05] dominion over another human and call it
[1:04:07] the working of the Holy Ghost.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL ON I
[1:04:12] FELT LED. WHAT IS the leading?
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; IS THE LEADING ARE HUMAN FRUSTRATIONS?
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; Cuz you can feel anointed being
[1:04:22] frustrated.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; IT'S LIKE TRYING TO PUT WHAT DID THEY
[1:04:26] SAY? WHAT'S THE WHAT'S the phrase? Uh a
[1:04:29] square peg in a round hole.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; IT'S HARD TO DO THAT. YOU CAN'T DO THAT
[1:04:34] WITHOUT TEARING SOMETHING UP.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? BUT WHAT WHAT LET ME JUST SAY
[1:04:39] THIS TO YOU. WHAT BROUGHT THE MESSAGE TO
[1:04:41] YOU AND I? I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT
[1:04:43] THIS. IF THE MESSAGE WAS ONLY DELIVERED
[1:04:46] WITH WHERE WHERE IT WOULD BE ACCEPTED,
[1:04:49] LET'S SAY BRANDON TABERNACLE AND IT
[1:04:51] WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN SPOKEN OUT IN
[1:04:53] OTHER PLACES. DO YOU KNOW THE MESSAGES
[1:04:55] YOU WOULD HAVE HAD TO HAVE GOT RID OF
[1:04:57] INVISIBLE UNION of the bride of Christ
[1:04:59] works AS FAITH EXPRESSED? AND LET ME
[1:05:01] JUST TELL YOU THAT LAST SERIES OF
[1:05:03] MESSAGES THERE IN SHREFPORT,
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; THEY DIDN'T EVEN WANT THE PROPHET THERE.
[1:05:10] AFTER HE OPENED UP AND HE PREACHED THE
[1:05:12] MESSAGE INVISIBLE UNION THAT CAME TO HIS
[1:05:15] HOTEL
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; AND TRIED to prevent him.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; And he stands the next night on the
[1:05:20] platform and calls every one of them his
[1:05:22] friends.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, let's have an oldfashioned prayer
[1:05:25] line.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "WHAT WAS THAT?" I'LL TELL YOU
[1:05:29] WHAT THAT WAS. THAT WAS THE LOVE OF GOD.
[1:05:31] [screaming] THESE ARE NOT JUST QUOTES.
[1:05:32] THESE AREN'T THESE AREN'T THESE ARE
[1:05:34] PROJECTIONS TO YOU AND I TO SAY LISTEN
[1:05:37] IF WHAT GOD DID IN HIM THEN THAT SAME
[1:05:40] GOD LIVES IN ME. NO, I'M NOT A PROPHET.
[1:05:42] I DON'T HAVE TO BE A PROPHET. BUT THAT
[1:05:44] WASN'T ABOUT BEING A PROPHET. THAT WAS
[1:05:46] ABOUT BEING A SON OF GOD YIELDED
[1:05:47] [screaming]
[1:05:48] TO THE LOVE OF GOD.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; SEE, brother Random would have made that
[1:05:54] his own. Think about what have been
[1:05:55] messed. It would have been missed. The
[1:05:57] messages
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; things would have been messed. You you
[1:06:00] understand what I'm saying? If he would
[1:06:01] have took into ACCOUNT AND MY HE'S GOING
[1:06:03] TO DEFEND THIS, he's going to do this,
[1:06:04] he's going to do this. As a MATTER OF
[1:06:05] FACT, HE STANDS THERE IN FREEPORT COMING
[1:06:08] DOWN THERE BEFORE that in what house
[1:06:10] will you build me? He has said at the at
[1:06:12] the dedication of the tabernacle in
[1:06:14] Tucson, I'm not going to go down there
[1:06:16] and preach doctrine.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; He said, because brother Moore does not
[1:06:20] see the message,
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; he said, I'm not not going to go there.
[1:06:23] He said, but of course, he said, you
[1:06:26] know, he said, if God leads me that way,
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:06:31] Are you with me?
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; Oh my. See, this is why brother
[1:06:34] Brandham, he had such respect. What
[1:06:36] what's to me is such direction he gave
[1:06:39] to us as ministers because he said, "I
[1:06:41] have enough respect to a brother to not
[1:06:43] go in his pull pit
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; and preach doctrine."
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; You see, well, brother Brandon went in
[1:06:48] his pit and he preached doctrine. He was
[1:06:50] a prophet of God.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; Are you WITH ME?
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; BUT NOTICE HOW THE PROPHET OF GOD
[1:06:55] CONDUCTED ITSELF. THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO
[1:06:56] GET IN THE PULL PIT IN ORDER TO DO THAT.
[1:06:59] YOU CAN ACTUALLY, THE BIBLE SPEAKS TO US
[1:07:01] ABOUT GETTING TOGETHER BROTHER TO
[1:07:04] BROTHER.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; Oh God, HELP US.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; WE DON'T NEED THINGS IN THE FRONT YARD.
[1:07:11] SETTLE IT IN THE BACKYARD.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; DON'T PUT IT OUT THERE ON INSTAGRAM.
[1:07:16] SETTLE IT IN THE BACKYARD.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; DON'T BRING THE BACKYARD ON YOUTUBE.
[1:07:20] SETTLE IT IN THE BACKYARD.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:07:29] INDEED, you do it toward all the
[1:07:31] brethren. I think this IS THE KEY. ALL
[1:07:33] THE BRETHREN BECAUSE NO DOUBT THERE WAS
[1:07:35] there was brethren that everyone
[1:07:37] including us THAT THINGS AREN'T EXACTLY
[1:07:41] JING OF PERSONALITY. BUT GOD DOES IT
[1:07:44] THAT WAY TO BRING OUT THE LOVE OF GOD IN
[1:07:47] OUR LIVES.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; THINK OF WHAT A TERRIBLE CHURCH IT would
[1:07:50] be if everybody was like you or like me.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; I mean, I GET ON MY OWN NERVES SOMETIME.
[1:07:56] RIGHT?
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; I MEAN, SOMETIMES I WANT TO JUST TAKE
[1:08:00] MYSELF AND SET MYSELF DOWN AND SAY,
[1:08:01] "I'LL BE BACK FOR YOU LATER."
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; You know what I'm talking about?
[1:08:09] [laughter]
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; Some of you will get that when you get
[1:08:10] home tonight on your pillow.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; But it's a truth.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE LET ME TELL YOU,
[1:08:16] MY OWN GREATEST ENEMY IS RIGHT HERE.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; You know what his name is? Samuel
[1:08:21] Brownie.
[1:08:25] Glory be to God.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad you came tonight?
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; BROTHERLY [screaming] LOVE. THIS
[1:08:32] BROTHERLY LOVE IS THE WORD PHILADELPHIA
[1:08:34] means love of brothers or sisters of
[1:08:38] brotherly love. Now this same word is
[1:08:40] used right there in the green. Seeing ye
[1:08:42] have purified your souls in obeying the
[1:08:46] truth through the spirit unto unfeigned
[1:08:50] love of the brethren. see that you love
[1:08:53] one another with a pure heart fervently.
[1:08:55] SO THIS WAS THIS WAS A checking as Paul
[1:08:59] Peter goes on to say being born again of
[1:09:01] that incorruptible SEED. BUT NOTICE
[1:09:04] PURIFYING the souls unto unfeigned love
[1:09:08] of the brethren. So the truth itself has
[1:09:12] the ability not only to sanctify us but
[1:09:16] the truth itself to bring ABOUT THAT
[1:09:20] REAL TRANSFORMATION on the inside to
[1:09:23] where we love the brethren.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; Now the real test comes is after you
[1:09:31] have to be with the brethren for a
[1:09:33] while.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; That's right. Woo.
[1:09:39] Then you just you kind of you're not
[1:09:41] just CAUGHT UP WITH WOO LOOK AT THE
[1:09:43] PETALS ON that thing. That is such A
[1:09:45] BEAUTIFUL PETAL. IT GOT THORNS TOO.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; So you know sometimes we oh my what
[1:09:54] happened? THEY WERE ALWAYS THERE. BUT
[1:09:55] YOU SEE GOD ALLOWS ALL THOSE THINGS FOR
[1:09:58] WHAT PURPOSE? TO BRING forth the love of
[1:10:00] God in our lives. I want you to notice
[1:10:03] this effect of divine love. The effect
[1:10:05] of divine love. the effect of the Holy
[1:10:08] Spirit coming into our life. The prophet
[1:10:10] said, "The greatest gift that God ever
[1:10:11] sent to the world was the Holy Ghost and
[1:10:14] and would rally around it. Oh, if we
[1:10:17] would break down our little bars and let
[1:10:19] the Holy Ghost come in among all of us
[1:10:21] and create a godly, brotherly love and
[1:10:26] respect."
[1:10:28] He goes on to say, "Think of the
[1:10:29] importance of Jesus at the door."
[1:10:31] Speaking of Revelations 3, trying to get
[1:10:33] in to create
[1:10:36] a brotherly love. So I want you to
[1:10:38] understand this as he's dropping these
[1:10:40] things in over and over that brotherly
[1:10:44] love cannot even be produced without
[1:10:48] divine love.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; The divine love of God coming into our
[1:10:52] lives. And then that divine love, it's
[1:10:56] not just something that's laying
[1:10:57] dormant. It's just something that's just
[1:10:59] there. It's expressive.
[1:11:03] It it comes out. And we see that all
[1:11:05] through the scripture. GOD HIMSELF, HE
[1:11:07] TAUGHT us on brotherly love. He came
[1:11:09] down. He laid down his life for us.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; Right? Even when the DISCIPLES WERE EVEN
[1:11:14] ALL OUT OF SORTS, HE DIDN'T DISOWN THEM.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? He could he could address needs.
[1:11:21] He could speak to things THAT WERE
[1:11:22] TAKING PLACE, BUT HE NEVER DISOWNED
[1:11:25] THEM. IT WAS VERY MUCH LIKE EVEN HOW JOB
[1:11:27] WAS IN TYPE WHEN JOB WAS ABLE TO DISCERN
[1:11:31] BETWEEN THAT WHEN HIS WIFE WAS SAYING
[1:11:33] WHAT SHE SAID AND HE SAID THOU SPEAKEST
[1:11:36] LIKE A FOOLISH WOMAN HE WAS NOT SHAMING
[1:11:38] HER HE WAS DISCERNING
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH THE WORD
[1:11:44] OF GOD THE LOVE OF GOD IT DOES IT BRINGS
[1:11:47] DISCERNMENT
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT'S GREATER than our feelings
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHY JESUS COULD SAY TO JOHN
[1:11:54] WHEN HE WAS READY TO CALL FIRE down and
[1:11:56] say, "You don't know what spirit you're
[1:11:57] of."
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; That's why he could say to Peter, and he
[1:12:01] wasn't speaking to Peter, but he was
[1:12:02] talking about the anointing that was
[1:12:04] upon him. Get behind me, Satan.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; Don't say that to your husband.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; Don't say it to your wife. Don't say it
[1:12:10] to another brother.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; But be wise as serpent and harmless as a
[1:12:14] dove.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; Because there's things there's things
[1:12:18] that can come. Anointing a thought and
[1:12:20] presence. You know, you get to dwelling
[1:12:21] on a wrong thought too long. Don't let
[1:12:24] them check your blood pressure.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; Why? IT HAS AN EFFECT. IT'S NOT JUST
[1:12:29] WELL AN AIMLESS THOUGHT. IT'S A SPIRIT
[1:12:31] ATTACHED TO THAT.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHY WHEN WE BEGIN TO THINK ON
[1:12:35] THE LOVE OF GOD AND KEEPING OURSELVES IN
[1:12:38] GOD'S LOVE, THAT'S THE ANTIDOTE IN OUR
[1:12:41] LIFE AGAINST THE SITUATIONS OF
[1:12:44] [screaming] LIFE.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; OH, thank you, Lord.
[1:12:49] Oh, hallelujah. Notice he says, "Let
[1:12:52] this audience tonight. Let them become
[1:12:54] one accord. Let all their traditions,
[1:12:56] every denominational barrier and
[1:12:58] everything, let the women straighten up.
[1:12:59] Let the men straighten up. Let the
[1:13:01] preacher STRAIGHTEN UP. LET'S ALL COME
[1:13:02] TOGETHER IN A REAL BIG BUNDLE of godly
[1:13:06] love."
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; See, to be able to let down to for even
[1:13:11] a meeting to be that way,
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; let down barriers. I mean, you think
[1:13:16] about it. We have a meeting and getting
[1:13:18] meeting together. Well, I'm not going to
[1:13:19] go to that meeting. Well, I go to that
[1:13:20] meeting. Well, I don't exactly. I mean,
[1:13:23] it's different. If there's if there Let
[1:13:24] me just say it to you. If there's things
[1:13:26] that are false doctrine, it's blatantly,
[1:13:28] I probably wouldn't be there either. But
[1:13:30] I'm going to tell you, they're still my
[1:13:32] brothers.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; And when it comes down, and I would say
[1:13:35] it to you like this, IF I WAS INVITED to
[1:13:38] preach in one of their church, I pray
[1:13:40] about it. If God leads me to PREACH IN
[1:13:42] SOMEONE PLACE THEY DON'T AGREE with me,
[1:13:44] I AM NOT GOING TO GET UP there and blast
[1:13:46] WHAT THEY BELIEVE.
[1:13:49] LET'S FIND SOME COMMON GROUND AND EXALT
[1:13:51] JESUS CHRIST
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD'S NOT SENDING ME IN THERE TO
[1:13:55] STRAIGHTEN SOMEBODY ELSE OUT. BECAUSE IF
[1:13:57] I GO IN WITH THAT ATTITUDE, I MIGHT AS
[1:13:59] WELL HAVE JUST STAYED AT home
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; cuz you're NOT GOING TO HELP ANYBODY.
[1:14:03] BUT SOMETIMES WE AND IT DEPENDS ON HOW
[1:14:05] WE'RE MADE UP. We're want to iron out
[1:14:06] all the wrinkles and get it all TAKEN
[1:14:08] CARE OF. IT DOESN'T HAPPEN THAT WAY.
[1:14:10] MANY TIMES IT'S JUST SIMPLY THE DISPLAY
[1:14:12] OF DIVINE LOVE THAT YOU CARE. There's an
[1:14:15] old saying, people don't care how much
[1:14:17] you know until they know how much you
[1:14:18] care.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; Now, watch this. We know, LOOK AT THIS
[1:14:27] TEST. WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE PASSED FROM
[1:14:28] DEATH unto life because we love the
[1:14:32] brethren.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; Not just that we can stand them,
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; we love them. NOW IT DOESN'T I WANT YOU
[1:14:39] TO UNDERSTAND it doesn't MEAN THAT YOU
[1:14:41] LIKE EVERYTHING ABOUT THEM
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU HAVE A LOVE FOR THEM
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND IS DON'T
[1:14:50] LET YOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES BECOME A
[1:14:54] WALL BETWEEN YOU
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; AND TO WHERE THAT YOU ONLY FELLOWSHIP
[1:15:00] WITHIN one circle
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; see that's a CHALLENGE
[1:15:07] WE WEREN'T TALKING ABOUT GROWTH WITHIN
[1:15:09] [screaming] OUR LIFE. LET ME TELL YOU,
[1:15:11] THIS IS WHAT THIS REVELATION OF GOD'S
[1:15:13] WORD WITHIN OUR LIFE. YOU'RE TALKING
[1:15:15] ABOUT A GREAT MIRACLE. THIS IS A GREAT
[1:15:17] MIRACLE.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; THIS IS A SUPERNATURAL WORKING WITHIN
[1:15:21] OUR LIVES. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THIS GETS
[1:15:23] DOWN TO? THIS touches our life to where
[1:15:26] we have to yield and the word come into
[1:15:29] action. Yes,
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; as long as we we can just we can preach
[1:15:34] and preach up here and it never gets
[1:15:36] down and touches our lives where we're
[1:15:37] living. I believe in preaching preaching
[1:15:40] the revelation. But you see, THIS COMES
[1:15:42] RIGHT OUT OF THAT REVELATION. IT'S
[1:15:44] FOLDING ON DOWN TO EVERYDAY LIFE. THE
[1:15:47] PROPHET WOULD TAKE 45 MINUTES TO AN HOUR
[1:15:50] TO open up Christ the mystery and deal
[1:15:52] with these things.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; Why out of a message that's almost 4
[1:15:57] hours long would he SPEND THAT MUCH TIME
[1:16:00] at the beginning? Because if that is not
[1:16:04] attended to and maintained and let that
[1:16:07] be the focus, then Christ is not going
[1:16:09] to be revealed through us.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; Notice he goes on to say, "Beloved,
[1:16:16] John, my I tell you what, John got a
[1:16:19] real got a got really filled with it.
[1:16:21] Beloved, let us love one another. For
[1:16:24] love is of God, and everyone that loveth
[1:16:28] is born of God, and knoweth God.
[1:16:32] So, everyone that loveth is born of God,
[1:16:35] and knoweth God. First John 4:12, no man
[1:16:38] hath seen God at any time. If we love
[1:16:42] one another, God dwelleth in us, and his
[1:16:46] love is perfected
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; in us.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:51] So John is bringing this over and over.
[1:16:53] This is a it's a testing. It's where we
[1:16:56] can look at in our lives. Now, let me
[1:16:58] just tell you something. There's going
[1:17:00] to be times and no doubt there has been
[1:17:02] times that you could look at the
[1:17:04] scripture and it's not to take you away.
[1:17:08] God doesn't take away the work of the
[1:17:10] Holy Spirit, the seal of the Holy SPIRIT
[1:17:13] IN YOUR LIFE. But we know we can grieve
[1:17:16] the Holy Spirit.
[1:17:18] AND SO AS A CHILD OF GOD WHERE THE
[1:17:20] SPIRIT OF GOD WILL speak to our hearts,
[1:17:23] speak to our lives, IT'S CALLING US TO
[1:17:25] THIS standard of the word of how there's
[1:17:28] to be an expression of the love of God
[1:17:31] through our lives. IT SHOULD BE
[1:17:32] SOMETHING WITHIN OUR LIVES. WE LOVE the
[1:17:35] brethren.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Samuel. Oh, I tell you what,
[1:17:42] you know, if I if we I just I just love
[1:17:45] I tell you what, over there in this
[1:17:46] particular church, over in this church,
[1:17:48] oh, I just love everybody.
[1:17:50] Go for a little bit. It's just like a
[1:17:52] people people come here and they visit.
[1:17:54] Oh, what love, what love. And I'll hear
[1:17:56] that over and over and I think just just
[1:17:58] stay a little bit. AND I'M NOT SAYING
[1:18:01] THAT I'M NOT SAYING THAT AS OH, WE GOT
[1:18:03] PROBLEM. WE HAVE PROBLEMS LIKE EVERYBODY
[1:18:04] ELSE.
[1:18:06] BUT BUT THE CHALLENGE IS IS WHEN WE'RE
[1:18:09] WORKING THINGS CONTINUE. YOU'RE NOT
[1:18:11] BECAUSE A CHURCH DOESN'T GET TO A SPOT
[1:18:13] TO SAY, "OH MY, I GOT YOU RIGHT WHERE I
[1:18:15] WANT you and now I GOT YOU AND NOW I GOT
[1:18:16] YOU AND NOW I GOT THIS AND OH PRAISE
[1:18:18] GOD." YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE A CHURCH
[1:18:21] OF mayag Christians.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. THAT IS A
[1:18:26] FALSE CONCEPTION. THERE IS CONSTANT WORK
[1:18:29] THAT'S GOING ON.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; THERE'S LIVES IN JOURNEY. THERE'S HEARTS
[1:18:34] THAT NEED TO BE DISCIPLED ALONG THE WAY.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; AND AT TIMES WE'RE GOING TO RUN THROUGH
[1:18:41] times like we covered on Sunday,
[1:18:43] WEARINESS AND MISUNDERSTANDING. WE'RE
[1:18:45] GOING TO HAVE THOSE TIMES my and
[1:18:47] rubbing. You know, WE ALL OF THAT'S
[1:18:49] GOING TO BE THERE. But all of that in
[1:18:51] itself is a moment where God will brings
[1:18:54] us right back in tune with his word
[1:18:57] to say, "Hey,
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; this is where we need to be focused."
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; I want you to think these script. Look
[1:19:03] at these scriptures I just read and let
[1:19:05] me read you here just a few quotes
[1:19:06] before I go on. Brother Bram says, "The
[1:19:09] love of God sealed in your heart,
[1:19:11] pressed in until all the world's pressed
[1:19:12] out, and you see nothing but the Lord to
[1:19:15] love him. And as you love one another,
[1:19:18] you love the Lord." If you don't love
[1:19:21] one another,
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; you can't love the Lord.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; He said so. And God can't move into you.
[1:19:31] So God cannot move INTO A PERSON IF YOU
[1:19:34] don't love. And I'm talking about even
[1:19:38] in needs. You know times friends, do you
[1:19:40] realize even when it comes down to
[1:19:44] people going into these the cancer
[1:19:46] treatments? I've read this to you before
[1:19:49] years ago.
[1:19:51] They first want to know before they
[1:19:52] start giving them this medication. They
[1:19:55] want to talk to them and they want to
[1:19:57] find if they have any grudges toward
[1:20:01] anybody
[1:20:02] or any bitterness. This is medical
[1:20:04] science. This isn't I'm not reading a
[1:20:06] quote. I'm not reading a scripture.
[1:20:09] But here's medical science said because
[1:20:12] if that's there that's in the spirit
[1:20:14] realm that's in the emotional realm. If
[1:20:17] that is there within a person's life,
[1:20:19] the medicine will do no good. Yeah.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Because you know why? You're a three-
[1:20:25] room house
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; and you're made. You see, that's is why
[1:20:29] that things cannot be expressed out of
[1:20:31] the soul if there's issues in the
[1:20:34] spirit.
[1:20:36] And that's the spirit realm is where the
[1:20:39] enemy likes to get in and get things
[1:20:40] built up.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; That's why that gate of affection is
[1:20:44] there in the spirit realm. But the gate
[1:20:46] of affection has got to be ruled by
[1:20:48] divine love.
[1:20:50] That's why memory has got to be ruled by
[1:20:52] divine love. BECAUSE A LOT OF YOU CAN
[1:20:54] HAVE MEMORIES. YOU CAN HAVE MEMORIES OF
[1:20:55] EVEN well so- and so said this and so
[1:20:57] and so said that. BUT IF AS YOU ABIDE IN
[1:21:00] DIVINE LOVE, YOU THEN CAN REALIZE I'VE
[1:21:02] SAID SOME THINGS THAT are off. AND MAN,
[1:21:05] HOW I WANT PEOPLE I DON'T WANT PEOPLE
[1:21:07] WALKING AROUND AND THAT'S ALL THEY
[1:21:08] REMEMBER ABOUT ME. I I WANT THEM TO HAVE
[1:21:11] HAD THE GRACE OF GOD TOWARD MY LIFE TO
[1:21:13] WHERE WE CAN SIT DOWN. AND IT'S NOT ALL
[1:21:15] ABOUT Samuel back here when he was such
[1:21:19] and such a age old. YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES
[1:21:22] THERE'S PEOPLE THEIR memories is like
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; they're missing memories.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; All they remember is somebody from when
[1:21:28] they had their kindergart kindergarten
[1:21:30] picture and here they are 45y old
[1:21:31] person.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; TRUE.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; GOD. YES. PICTURE FRAMES. BUT IT'S TO
[1:21:37] SEE WHERE WE'VE COME FROM. THERE'S
[1:21:38] GROWTH WITHIN OUR LIVES. AND THAT'S WHY
[1:21:40] we need we need divine love to rule over
[1:21:43] the gates in our spirit to rule over
[1:21:45] imagination. Oh, I seen that brother. I
[1:21:47] know he seen me. I know he walked right
[1:21:49] BY ME. YOU NEED DIVINE LOVE TO SAY AH.
[1:21:53] You're not coming in THIS GATE.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT DISTURBING like Nehemiah said
[1:21:58] the rest.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; If I catch you, NEHEMIAH SAID, OUTSIDE
[1:22:02] OF THESE GATES WANTING TO SELL FISH,
[1:22:05] I'LL take you down.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW THE SCRIPTURES. NEHEMIAH WENT
[1:22:09] PLAYING. HE DIDN'T JUST LET HIM IN. HE
[1:22:11] SAID, "DON'T even be bringing that aroma
[1:22:12] around here.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; DO NOT DISTURB THE REST. YOU AND I ARE
[1:22:18] IN REST, BUT WE HAVE A STEWARDSHIP TO
[1:22:20] SAY, I WILL NOT ALLOW THE REST TO BE
[1:22:23] DISTURBED." BECAUSE WHY? IT DON'T JUST
[1:22:25] AFFECT YOU. IT'LL AFFECT YOUR WHOLE
[1:22:27] FAMILY.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; IT'LL AFFECT EVERY RELATIONSHIP. IT'LL
[1:22:30] AFFECT HOW YOU WORK ON YOUR JOB. IT'LL
[1:22:33] AFFECT EVERYTHING. YOU CANNOT JUST TAKE
[1:22:35] SOMETHING AND IT BE COMPARTMENTALIZED IN
[1:22:38] YOUR SPIRIT AND IT doesn't affect
[1:22:39] everything else.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; My my my my
[1:22:45] God can move into you here. So here's a
[1:22:47] real litmus test. You know litmus test
[1:22:50] where you really you really test these
[1:22:52] things. You know when they're they're
[1:22:53] testing for sometimes and you know
[1:22:55] they're testing for acidity. They're
[1:22:56] testing for things. We used to have to
[1:22:58] do that in chemistry and how much you
[1:22:59] know acidity and this and that. And then
[1:23:01] even when they do uh you know pressures
[1:23:03] uh pressure test on water you know
[1:23:05] they'll you want to put in a sprinkler
[1:23:07] system well it's got to be 30 PSI and
[1:23:09] then all of a sudden okay good 30 PSI
[1:23:11] that's not the final test the final test
[1:23:12] okay 30 PSI you put the other thing on
[1:23:15] there and now it's got to be when you
[1:23:17] can fill a 5 gallon bucket and how much
[1:23:19] time
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; SO THERE'S CONTINUAL TESTS THAT ARE
[1:23:23] GOING ON THAT'S THE SAME WAY WITHIN our
[1:23:26] lives there is a testing IN OUR LIFE
[1:23:28] LORD HOW CAN I KNOW I AM WHERE I NEED TO
[1:23:31] BE because I'll just be honest with you.
[1:23:33] I can look at myself in the mirror and
[1:23:35] say, "Man,
[1:23:37] pretty good, man. You're doing good.
[1:23:43] You deserve the recliner today, buddy.
[1:23:45] You're doing a good job, MAN." THAT'S
[1:23:47] ALL OF US.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; BUT THAT'S WHY WE CANNOT LEAN to our own
[1:23:53] understanding.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; SEE, THE EXPERIENCE IN OUR LIFE HAS
[1:23:57] BROUGHT US TO RELY UPON THE WORD.
[1:24:01] AND WE RELY UPON THE WORD, LORD, WHAT DO
[1:24:04] YOU SEE ABOUT ME?
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; HOW DO YOU SEE ME, LORD? AFTER THE
[1:24:08] MESSAGE COMES FORTH IN A SERVICE, WE GO
[1:24:11] INTO PRAYER IN OUR OWN PRAYER CLOSET.
[1:24:13] HOW DO YOU SEE ME, LORD?
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; Lordise
[1:24:19] Bram says, "You'll come never come into
[1:24:20] the kingdom of God until the Holy Spirit
[1:24:22] has healed you in the kingdom by his
[1:24:24] divine love." That the whole Christian
[1:24:26] world is your brother and sister. The
[1:24:28] world's sealed out and the God is sealed
[1:24:30] in. And when you love ONE ANOTHER TRULY
[1:24:34] WITH DIVINE CHRISTIAN LOVE, then you
[1:24:38] know the Holy Spirit is working through
[1:24:42] you. Then
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; so if I'm walking on the water, that's
[1:24:51] not it.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; If I'm praying for the sick and they're
[1:24:54] being healed, it's not it. If I'm
[1:24:57] preaching, that's not it.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; IF I CAN QUOTE, THAT'S NOT IT. ALL OF
[1:25:04] THOSE THINGS HAVE THEIR PART. BUT YOU
[1:25:06] TAKE ALL THOSE THINGS AND THIS IS NOT
[1:25:08] THERE. Tingling symbol.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY WEIGHT.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; IT'S LIKE LOOKING AT IF I HAD TWO
[1:25:17] DIFFERENT BALLS THAT ARE UP HERE TONIGHT
[1:25:19] AND YOU HAVE THEM DENSITY. ONE IS LIKE
[1:25:22] ONE OF THOSE LITTLE PLASTIC BALLS THEY
[1:25:24] SELL AT WALMART. And then another one,
[1:25:25] maybe they look exactly the same, but
[1:25:27] the other one is a bowling ball. The
[1:25:30] bowling ball has density.
[1:25:33] And that's the same thing. That's what
[1:25:34] the love of God is in our life. It gives
[1:25:37] density.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; It gives substance. Our life isn't just
[1:25:40] filled and looking right on the outside,
[1:25:43] but it's got something behind it.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; It's got something that that pushes IT
[1:25:47] ON. IT'S GOT SOMETHING THAT WHEN THE
[1:25:49] pins of life, like in a bowling eye, the
[1:25:51] pins of life come up, IT'S GOT A
[1:25:52] SUBSTANCE THAT CARRIES US.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; I know. Don't throw me out because I
[1:25:58] said bowling. Just just an example.
[1:26:02] Okay. Put down the bar. [panting]
[1:26:05] Then you know the Holy Spirit really is
[1:26:07] working through you. Then now these
[1:26:10] quotes that I'm giving us this isn't
[1:26:12] about everybody is standing around and
[1:26:14] holding hands and singing kumbaya and
[1:26:17] BECAUSE THE PROPHET TAKES US IN THE
[1:26:18] CHURCH AGE book and says THE PROTESTANTS
[1:26:21] AND THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IS ALL TRYING TO
[1:26:24] BRING EVERYONE TOGETHER IN a great
[1:26:27] brotherhood of understanding
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; and they don't even agree
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; they're not it's BUT IT'S SEE WHAT IT IS
[1:26:36] IT'S UNDER A FALSE UNION
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE ONLY WAY THAT A REAL
[1:26:41] BROTHERHOOD IS IS BY THE UNION OF CHRIST
[1:26:45] WITH HIS PEOPLE
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; INDIVIDUALLY.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; OH, we're going to have a brotherhood of
[1:26:51] tolerance.
[1:26:53] Look what the Bible says.
[1:26:56] She is a cage of every unclean
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; and hateful bird.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, we just love everybody. We take in
[1:27:08] everything. Well, we do love fallen
[1:27:11] humanity,
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; but we don't LOVE THE SIN.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; WE LOVE THE SINNER, BUT NOT THE SIN.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU HEARING ME?
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT IT'S NOT THAT THE THE BRIDE OF
[1:27:22] CHRIST IS, "OH, WE'RE IN DIRE NEED FOR
[1:27:24] MEMBERS." THAT'S NOT WHAT IT IS. WHAT'S
[1:27:26] IN OUR HEART IS WHAT WAS IN HIS HEART
[1:27:28] THAT BROUGHT HIM TO EARTH TO GO LOOK OUT
[1:27:31] [screaming] HIS FALLEN BROTHERS. RIGHT.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; He took part
[1:27:38] as the brethren were in flesh and blood.
[1:27:41] He came too. God took part of his own
[1:27:45] creation or he created a part of his own
[1:27:49] creation and became one of us. Is that
[1:27:51] right?
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; And so we are brethren BECAUSE WE WERE
[1:27:56] ALWAYS [screaming]
[1:27:56] BRETHREN BEFORE THE FOUNDATION of the
[1:27:58] world.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; BUT WE HAD TO HAVE SOME WAY TO GET BACK
[1:28:02] TO THAT LIFE. AND he who is the life,
[1:28:05] the source of life, himself became one
[1:28:08] of us, that we might share in his life.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; Notice this scripture here. I'm I'm I'm
[1:28:15] trying to bring this down here. He that
[1:28:17] He that loveth his brother abideth in
[1:28:22] light, in the light. Not just light, but
[1:28:26] the light. And the light is God. He's
[1:28:29] abiding there. It's where he's dwelling.
[1:28:32] And there's none occasion of stumbling
[1:28:34] in him.
[1:28:36] Every one of us have been in places
[1:28:38] where you're walking in the dark,
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; And that's not comfortable.
[1:28:44] Yeah. You you you're walking, but you
[1:28:47] know, sometimes our eyes can get
[1:28:48] accustomed to certain things and and so
[1:28:50] forth. I think at times when I've walked
[1:28:52] walked up uh walked up the path there
[1:28:54] and a lot of times I just walk without
[1:28:56] the light but I know there's some sticks
[1:28:58] and stuff in the way and sometimes my
[1:29:00] foot will get caught on maybe a a twig
[1:29:02] or a branch that I should have moved out
[1:29:04] of the way and you know because you can
[1:29:05] see TO A CERTAIN EXTENT BUT I CAN'T SEE
[1:29:07] LIKE IT WAS in the daylight
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; and it's LIKE WHEN LIGHT ITSELF WHEN
[1:29:11] WE'RE ABIDING IN LIGHT YOU KNOW WHAT IT
[1:29:13] DOES LIGHT EXPOSES
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; IT EXPOSES DARKNESS IT EXPOSES THE THE
[1:29:20] ENEMY'S ATTEMPT TO WANT TO ENSNARE US.
[1:29:23] IT ACTUALLY IS WHAT EXPOSES AND BRINGS
[1:29:27] DISCERNMENT to be able to say that's not
[1:29:29] my brother. That's not my sister.
[1:29:33] Deep. That's Satan getting in there.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; See, light brings discernment.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; IT EXPOSES. IT ALLOWS YOU TO BE ABLE TO
[1:29:42] SEPARATE THE SPIRIT AND WHATEVER IT IS
[1:29:45] THAT'S GOT BETWEEN. WHAT DOES THAT?
[1:29:47] LIGHT DOES THAT. RIGHT?
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT THE LIGHT DOES. AND THE
[1:29:51] LIGHT brings us to that for for that uh
[1:29:54] for us to see that. Notice it gives
[1:29:56] illumination and brings discernment.
[1:29:58] Notice what Paul says here in Romans 12
[1:30:01] 9-10. Let love be
[1:30:04] without dissimilation.
[1:30:08] That's without hypocrisy,
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; Let love be without dissimilation. Abore
[1:30:15] that which is evil. So don't it's not
[1:30:17] breaking away it's keeping together.
[1:30:19] Abore that which is evil. Pleave to that
[1:30:22] which is good. Be kindly affection one
[1:30:25] to another with brotherly love in honor
[1:30:29] preferring one another.
[1:30:32] So when light will show up what is evil?
[1:30:36] You step away from it.
[1:30:39] And you say well h how does how does
[1:30:41] that look? What do you mean by stepping
[1:30:42] away of it? Brother Bram says in the
[1:30:44] message token, he says, "Don't never
[1:30:46] speak evil against one another."
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; And speaking evil isn't just, "I tell
[1:30:53] you what, brother Shane, he's a bad
[1:30:54] apple."
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; No, IT'S EVEN IF YOU KNOW SOMETHING,
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; DON'T SAY IT.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; WHEN WHEN DID THAT TAKE PLACE? WELL,
[1:31:06] THAT TOOK PLACE FIVE YEARS AGO. HOW DO
[1:31:08] YOU KNOW THAT [screaming] HE'S NOT
[1:31:10] REPENTED OF THAT?
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[1:31:13] AND HERE WE ARE PUTTING COUNTERFEIT
[1:31:16] BILLS BACK INTO CIRCULATION AGAIN.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "HOW DO I STOP THAT?" IF
[1:31:20] SOMEBODY ELSE BRINGS IT UP, SAY, "WAIT,
[1:31:22] WAIT. LET'S let's pray.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; That'll stop it.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; That'll stop it."
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE WHAT THAT IS? That's a son of
[1:31:30] God taking dominion.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; Let's pray for my brother. Let's pray
[1:31:34] for them. Let's pray for this. Let's
[1:31:37] pray. Well, I tell you what, brother
[1:31:39] Samuel. I've been praying a long time.
[1:31:41] It must not have been in the right frame
[1:31:43] of prayer because you're still coming
[1:31:45] away with [snorts]
[1:31:47] something that just not the right aroma
[1:31:52] [snorts]
[1:31:58] THAT GOT SOME BACTERIA IN IT. HOW WHERE
[1:32:00] YOU HAD THAT AT?
[1:32:02] WHERE'S THAT BIN AT?
[1:32:05] IT CAN'T BE IN THE LIGHT BECAUSE THE
[1:32:07] LIGHT WOULD DETECT THAT BACTERIA
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU TAKE IT TO THE LIGHT. SEE,
[1:32:12] LISTEN. WE ARE GOING TO LISTEN. WE HAVE
[1:32:14] THINGS THAT are real and true. THERE ARE
[1:32:17] WRONGS. THERE ARE things that WE CAN SAY
[1:32:19] THAT BROTHER WAS WRONG. THAT SISTER WAS
[1:32:20] RIGHT. BUT DON'T TAKE IT IN THE
[1:32:22] DARKNESS. BRING IT TO THE LIGHT. BECAUSE
[1:32:25] AS YOU BRING IT TO THE LIGHT, IT EXPOSES
[1:32:27] IT TO WHERE YOU CAN SAY THAT'S MY
[1:32:29] BROTHER,
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; LORD. I DON'T KNOW WHY, MY SISTER, BUT I
[1:32:33] KNOW, LORD, MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING THAT
[1:32:35] THEY'VE GONE THROUGH.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; There's some reason you get in his
[1:32:40] presence.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; Let's just fellowship for a moment.
[1:32:48] Sometimes that getting into his presence
[1:32:51] on those things. Oh, how I wish it could
[1:32:54] happen that particular moment.
[1:33:00] Sometimes it's taken days,
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; sometimes weeks.
[1:33:05] It's okay. You don't have to say amen.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; But I know what I'm talking about.
[1:33:10] That's why Brother Bram says before you
[1:33:12] go and talk to that brother, you go pray
[1:33:14] till you've got the right feeling.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; See, brother Bram, let he laid these
[1:33:19] things all the way through so that you
[1:33:21] and I CAN SAY, "WAIT A MINUTE. I GOT TO
[1:33:23] GO AND I GOT TO GIVE MYSELF TO GOD
[1:33:24] BECAUSE I CANNOT DO IT by my own power,
[1:33:26] by my own might, BUT BY MY SPIRIT,
[1:33:28] SAYETH THE LORD, THIS
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; MOUNTAIN shall be removed.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. GOD EVEN TEACHING US through
[1:33:35] these things to rest on him. The prophet
[1:33:37] said, "Don't ever speak evil against one
[1:33:38] another. If somebody MAKES A MISTAKE,
[1:33:40] PRAY for him right quick."
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; So, I see brother BRIAN MAKE A MISTAKE.
[1:33:44] HEY, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, brother
[1:33:45] Dave. This guy made such a mistake.
[1:33:48] Let's pray for him.
[1:33:51] Oh, I tell you, brother Brian made he he
[1:33:53] tell you he made such a mistake, brother
[1:33:55] Brian. He this Brian over here.
[1:33:58] He made such a mistake. But let's pray
[1:34:00] for him.
[1:34:02] You missed the point.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; THIS IS TALKING ABOUT HE YOU SEE, HE
[1:34:08] MADE A MISTAKE. YOU PRAY FOR HIM.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; DON'T ANNOUNCE [screaming] IT. PRAY FOR
[1:34:12] HIM.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT SWEEPING IT UNDER THE RUG.
[1:34:16] THAT'S STANDING IN [screaming] I AM MY
[1:34:18] BROTHER'S KEEPER.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:34:21] I AM MY SISTERS KEEPERS STANDING IN FOR
[1:34:24] THEM. IT'S US STANDING IN THE GAP. AND
[1:34:26] IT'S NOT US. IT'S CHRIST IN US STANDING
[1:34:28] IN THE GAP [screaming] IN THE BREACH FOR
[1:34:30] ONE ANOTHER.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:34:38] Can I give just one more point?
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; Sister Stephanie said, "Bring it on."
[1:34:45] [laughter]
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; I love it.
[1:34:52] But look at this here and I'm going to
[1:34:53] read you a quote.
[1:34:55] When you see this with the statue of a
[1:34:58] perfect man and I want to say to you
[1:35:00] that when we look at this and we
[1:35:03] consider it, remember
[1:35:06] there's elements that God brings us as
[1:35:08] he seals our life and our faith. Like
[1:35:10] the prophet said, when that water comes
[1:35:13] down through that rock box,
[1:35:17] he says it brings our faith from
[1:35:20] intellectual to supernatural.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; Remember sister Shepherd, the water was
[1:35:25] on her feet. So, brother Bram says you
[1:35:27] start with your new birth and then you
[1:35:31] grow up into him in all things.
[1:35:34] So
[1:35:36] when we see this, we recognize that as
[1:35:40] this is going up, and I don't want to
[1:35:42] spend a long time with this, but when we
[1:35:44] recognize we're continuing. It's not
[1:35:45] like, oh, I got to get I got to get all
[1:35:47] the faith, and then when I get faith, oh
[1:35:49] man, then I'm going to add virtue.
[1:35:52] It's growing together. Right?
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; Remember, Brother Brandham says if
[1:35:57] you're not born again, it's like trying
[1:35:59] to put
[1:36:01] peacock feathers in a blackbird,
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; Everybody understand that?
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; Because there has to be a, you know, you
[1:36:08] have to have an understanding. Yeah.
[1:36:09] There's virtue. Oh, yeah. God, God gives
[1:36:11] strength. He gives strength. He gives a
[1:36:13] He gives where there's a strength that
[1:36:14] can been produced in our life. There's a
[1:36:15] knowledge of God's word. You're able to
[1:36:17] approach the word with knowledge. But
[1:36:18] you're not in the place to where where
[1:36:21] where now it's going to grow into that.
[1:36:24] But yet God there's elements of these
[1:36:26] things that are coming along, but the
[1:36:28] Holy Spirit seals us. And then is where
[1:36:30] we grow clear to the rapture.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; And this right here is where we're
[1:36:37] called to manifest. We're called to
[1:36:38] manifest all these.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; But you know what, Brother Brian? How
[1:36:42] silly would it look if our faith was
[1:36:44] this big and our brotherly kindness was
[1:36:47] here? And how silly would it also look
[1:36:50] if faith's way out here and brotherly
[1:36:52] kindness is one little thing.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; See, it's all proportional.
[1:36:57] One [snorts] supporting another
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; it that because the word remember it's
[1:37:03] all Christ. It's one picture. It's not
[1:37:06] compartmentalized. It's one picture.
[1:37:07] It's Christ. It's his life. So then when
[1:37:11] you see this, watch how Brother Bram
[1:37:12] takes this here in the message on
[1:37:14] brotherly kindness, which is brotherly
[1:37:15] love. He says, "When you get to that
[1:37:18] brotherly kindness, put yourself in his
[1:37:20] place on the matter."
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; So after everything is talked out and
[1:37:27] finally and my my my we've talked, we've
[1:37:30] talked, we finally come and you realize,
[1:37:34] I need to go to God in prayer.
[1:37:37] How can this be it? How can that be? And
[1:37:39] you realize after it's all said and
[1:37:41] done, you know what? And God lets us, HE
[1:37:45] KNOWS WHERE WHERE HE IS. WE'RE GOING TO
[1:37:46] COME TO IT. And there's GROWTH COMING IN
[1:37:50] OUR LIFE TO BE ABLE TO PUT OURSELVES in
[1:37:52] the matter. And the other brother in the
[1:37:55] person's shoes. Watch. Watch this. My
[1:37:57] brother sinned against me, said Peter.
[1:37:59] Shall I forgive him? Seven times a day.
[1:38:03] He said 70* 7. Peter said, "Got to get a
[1:38:07] bigger file cabinet. may have to borrow
[1:38:09] Amazon's database.
[1:38:11] So, let me see. Let me GET THAT RIGHT. I
[1:38:13] ONLY HAVE TO FORGIVE BROTHER BRIAN, that
[1:38:15] sorry guy, 490 times. After 490, you're
[1:38:20] it, buddy. You've been picking on you
[1:38:22] tonight. Pick on brother Carlos back
[1:38:24] there every while.
[1:38:27] It's not ABOUT THAT. THAT WAS NOT SAID
[1:38:29] IN THAT WAY THAT WE KEEP TRACK. BUT IT'S
[1:38:32] IT'S SOMETHING THAT WITHIN US THAT
[1:38:34] FORGIVENESS, THE LOVE OF GOD IN OUR LIFE
[1:38:37] IS TO RELEASE. THAT'S THE GLORY. IT'S TO
[1:38:39] BE ABLE TO RELEASE THE OFFENSE.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; YES. AMEN.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; As you read in the scripture of the one
[1:38:45] who begged the king, please forgive me.
[1:38:47] Please forgive me. He had to pay back a
[1:38:49] million dollars. And the king said,
[1:38:51] sure. Then he goes to one of then this
[1:38:54] guy goes to one of his servants that
[1:38:55] owes him only a nickel.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; BRING YOU GIVE ME THAT NICKEL.
[1:39:02] The
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; king heard about it. It said, "You won't
[1:39:04] forgive your brother or your sister.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; Your forgiveness is put on HOLD
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; AND I'M GOING TO SEND THE TORMENTORS
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; IN YOUR SPIRIT. MIGHT EVEN SHOW UP IN
[1:39:16] YOUR BODY. I'M GOING TO SEND THE
[1:39:17] TORMENTORS BECAUSE YOU'RE MY SON AND I
[1:39:20] WILL NOT APPROVE OF THAT BEHAVIOR."
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; GLORY BE TO GOD.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; AREN'T YOU THANKFUL FOR GOD'S MERCY?
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN. PRAISE GOD.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; BROTHERLY KINDNESS. IF A BROTHER IS ALL
[1:39:33] out of tune,
[1:39:35] don't be impatient with him.
[1:39:38] Now, why would Brother Bram have to say
[1:39:40] that? Because that's natural human
[1:39:42] reaction.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, I always knew that, brother. I
[1:39:46] always
[1:39:48] [clears throat]
[1:39:49] that always knew is like cracker jacket
[1:39:51] discernment.
[1:39:53] I ALWAYS KNEW. I ALWAYS KNEW. I ALWAYS
[1:39:56] KNEW.
[1:39:58] God allows things to take place. Don't
[1:40:02] be impatient with him. You know, that's
[1:40:04] victory in itself.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; Is being able
[1:40:08] to be patient with him.
[1:40:11] The patience doesn't mean compromise.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; Patient doesn't mean I'm going to get
[1:40:16] the last word in.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; No, be patient with him.
[1:40:22] Brother said, somebody said not long
[1:40:25] ago, how can you believe these things
[1:40:27] the way you do and still go to the
[1:40:29] assemblies of God and oneness and all
[1:40:31] the rest? But the Ram said, see, put on
[1:40:33] brotherly kindness. I'm hoping someday,
[1:40:36] watch these attributes working. Patience
[1:40:38] with him, temperant, enduring with him
[1:40:43] being like kind of like biting the
[1:40:44] tongue.
[1:40:46] Doesn't mean you're compromising. It's
[1:40:47] just you you just kind of know. Some of
[1:40:49] you can relate to this. You've had
[1:40:50] teenage you can relate to this. You
[1:40:53] you're patient times you got to bite
[1:40:55] your tongue.
[1:40:57] Knowledge not anything anything wrong
[1:40:59] with teenagers. Knowledge to understand
[1:41:01] what it you hear him. You've heard him
[1:41:03] out. Understand what he believes. Okay.
[1:41:05] You know remember it's in his heart.
[1:41:08] That's what it is. Virtue in yourself to
[1:41:12] let it go out with kindness,
[1:41:15] meekness to him. having faith that
[1:41:17] someday that God will bring him in.
[1:41:25] This is God operating
[1:41:28] in a body of believers.
[1:41:32] Now, what I just read is that something
[1:41:34] that right here and now we, oh my, when
[1:41:38] the Holy Ghost has come, man, that's
[1:41:39] exactly where I'm at. No God, these
[1:41:41] things have to be
[1:41:43] born in our lives and through
[1:41:46] situations.
[1:41:49] This is where fruit comes forth
[1:41:52] as we yield in our lives to him.
[1:41:56] Brotherly love.
[1:41:59] Brotherly love.
[1:42:01] A family
[1:42:03] purchased with the blood of Jesus
[1:42:05] Christ.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; Born of his spirit. Perfect in our
[1:42:09] natural family. Not everybody's perfect,
[1:42:12] right? Not everybody in the Browning
[1:42:13] family except me,
[1:42:18] right? Not everybody's perfect.
[1:42:21] That even includes me. Get a few
[1:42:23] scratches here and there.
[1:42:26] But on the more serious note,
[1:42:32] I want to say because I certainly don't
[1:42:34] feel that way at all. There's if there's
[1:42:35] one critic, I'm I'm the biggest critic
[1:42:37] I've got.
[1:42:40] But God here working through a family of
[1:42:43] brothers and sisters
[1:42:45] and teaching us.
[1:42:47] Do brothers and sisters at times have
[1:42:51] disagreements?
[1:42:54] Yeah. To have the thought that
[1:42:57] [laughter]
[1:42:58] there'll never be any disagreements.
[1:43:03] This is believer spoken word tabernacle,
[1:43:05] not Walt Disney World.
[1:43:08] Okay, this is this is where character is
[1:43:10] being molded.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; This is where we're being shaped and one
[1:43:14] way or sooner or later no matter it's
[1:43:16] just like from a person and there's
[1:43:18] sometimes I understand we have to change
[1:43:20] jobs. So I don't put every I'm not I'm
[1:43:22] not putting anybody in any category but
[1:43:24] sometimes the things that we're running
[1:43:25] from is the very things God's trying to
[1:43:27] bring a showdown in our life to help us
[1:43:29] to see I want to be more in you
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; than what I am right now. And God will
[1:43:37] continue to go. And you say, "Will God
[1:43:38] do that?" Yeah. He's a faithful father.
[1:43:40] He'll continue to do that and bringing
[1:43:42] us around. But this a brotherly love to
[1:43:45] where we have brothers and sisters.
[1:43:47] Brother Ram says within fellowship,
[1:43:49] there's protection. You have brothers
[1:43:52] that pray for you,
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; sisters that pray for you.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; That's why that even as we would pray
[1:43:58] for one another, you don't see someone
[1:43:59] here, take it on your heart in prayer.
[1:44:01] Someone comes to your heart, pray for
[1:44:03] them. even to even to reach out to them
[1:44:05] just even if you have to say within
[1:44:07] yourself you know sometimes there's
[1:44:10] things depending on how we are made up
[1:44:13] sometimes how we're made up we have to
[1:44:15] understand first of all even how we're
[1:44:17] made up to even have to go beyond the
[1:44:20] boundaries but how God will test things
[1:44:24] I say God just give me the grace
[1:44:29] to be this
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; that's what I want to be I I want to be
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; in that stature of a perfect man.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; That's not only do I want that to be the
[1:44:40] testimony that
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; he loved God, he loved the word, and he
[1:44:44] loved God's people.
[1:44:47] What a testimony.
[1:44:50] And you know, if we love it in that way,
[1:44:52] we'll love we'll love humanity. I love
[1:44:55] humanity. I go to different stores and
[1:44:57] go to different ones. Sometimes I don't
[1:44:59] even know the people's names. We
[1:45:00] recognize faces and one or more and you
[1:45:02] know we just I like to try to at least
[1:45:04] leave them there with a smile on their
[1:45:05] face
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; you know when you go into the meat
[1:45:08] counter at flickers and I like to leave
[1:45:10] them with a smile on their face you know
[1:45:11] they
[1:45:13] places you go
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; you never know
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; how do you know that that where what a
[1:45:17] person is going through that day
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; you want to you want to leave
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; right
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; better than what where where what you
[1:45:24] found it may God help us
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; let's just pray heavenly Father,
[1:45:31] how we know Lord that we we cannot Lord
[1:45:35] be able to fulfill this without you.
[1:45:39] So Lord, we certainly request and we
[1:45:42] desire
[1:45:43] that Lord Jesus
[1:45:46] in each of our lives, oh God, not only
[1:45:50] Lord that you would fill hearts and fill
[1:45:53] lives, but continue, Lord, just to
[1:45:55] refill us, Lord, and and guide us, Lord,
[1:45:58] that as we would look, Lord, in the
[1:46:01] approach, Lord, as we giving ourselves
[1:46:04] to you, Lord Jesus,
[1:46:06] help us, Lord, in these in every situ
[1:46:09] situation, Lord. We never
[1:46:12] we never know, Lord, what tomorrow
[1:46:14] holds. We don't know what the future
[1:46:16] holds. We don't even we don't know that,
[1:46:18] Lord. But we know that you hold the
[1:46:19] future and our life is in your hands. So
[1:46:23] Lord, we're asking God for your divine
[1:46:25] mercy. And Lord, we we want to see
[1:46:30] want to see that Lord so completely in
[1:46:34] our lives.
[1:46:36] Lord Jesus,
[1:46:38] there's Lord degrees of that. If Paul
[1:46:41] could write in that scripture that we
[1:46:44] referred to where he said concerning
[1:46:47] brotherly love, you need not that I
[1:46:49] write unto you, for you yourselves are
[1:46:52] taught of God. if he could write and ex
[1:46:56] and express to them commend them for the
[1:47:00] love toward all the brethren that's
[1:47:02] being shown
[1:47:04] and would also admonish them to increase
[1:47:08] more and more then Lord we know that
[1:47:13] there is more for us and you know Lord
[1:47:17] it's one thing for me to say this or
[1:47:19] anyone else to say it but when we really
[1:47:22] see that we need more
[1:47:25] is when the need arises.
[1:47:30] It wasn't Lord until the prophet had
[1:47:33] need of squirrels that the inspiration
[1:47:37] dropped to call for squirrels.
[1:47:40] It wasn't until Abraham had need
[1:47:45] for the ram
[1:47:48] until the inspiration dropped.
[1:47:52] Lord Jesus,
[1:47:55] same way Lord where the prophet I think
[1:47:58] Lord when he said that anointing drop
[1:48:01] there
[1:48:02] he was there I believe getting ready to
[1:48:04] preach meetings in Shreport in a morning
[1:48:08] and he began to relay
[1:48:14] regarding his wife said Lord she stood
[1:48:17] between me and the public
[1:48:19] Lord she's cooked my meal clothes. She's
[1:48:22] ironed my clothes. Lord, she she's not
[1:48:26] complained when under after under after
[1:48:27] under after under after under after the
[1:48:28] pressure I would go out hunting. He be
[1:48:30] to intercede
[1:48:33] on her behalf
[1:48:35] and at that moment
[1:48:38] you said stand on your feet and as you
[1:48:41] say it
[1:48:43] is that's how it will be.
[1:48:47] Oh God,
[1:48:50] this is where Lord your word
[1:48:53] it comes into fruition in our lives and
[1:48:57] what we see the need for Lord
[1:49:01] we need more of you
[1:49:04] less of ourselves that's what Lord with
[1:49:07] the revelation of the word breaking over
[1:49:09] our life it's letting us know it's
[1:49:11] moving in our life as sons and daughters
[1:49:13] of God
[1:49:16] you are always my son, always my
[1:49:18] daughter. And the Holy Spirit making
[1:49:20] this real to us, Lord. And God, there's
[1:49:22] an expression coming through our lives
[1:49:24] is just like the prophet, let us have
[1:49:26] that little litmus test where he could
[1:49:29] say, if we love the brethren, then we
[1:49:31] know the Holy Spirit is working
[1:49:34] through us.
[1:49:36] Oh God,
[1:49:38] help us. Lord,
[1:49:41] help us. We could Lord have everything
[1:49:43] else
[1:49:45] but if we miss that we miss everything
[1:49:48] Lord.
[1:49:51] But Lord, we know that Father, when the
[1:49:53] love of God has come, when the Holy
[1:49:55] Spirit has come, when that revelation of
[1:49:58] Jesus Christ has struck our heart, then
[1:50:01] Lord, we know that that love that not
[1:50:04] only took us from the world and took the
[1:50:07] world out of us. But God, your grace is
[1:50:11] sufficient to see us through. We want to
[1:50:15] abide in the light, Lord. The enemy Lord
[1:50:19] always is trying to thwart that Lord and
[1:50:22] try to draw us out into the flesh. He
[1:50:24] tried the prophet right there on the
[1:50:26] platform in Oregon. Tried there in the
[1:50:29] in the pasture with the bull in the
[1:50:30] backyard with the hornets. on and on. We
[1:50:33] see that Lord and undoubtedly
[1:50:37] Lord God we all are able to stand here
[1:50:39] and say Lord forgive me
[1:50:43] for getting pulled into the flesh spirit
[1:50:45] realm
[1:50:47] flesh
[1:50:49] but Lord as your children
[1:50:53] we want to learn
[1:50:56] we want to learn it's not to where we
[1:50:58] become altogether knowledgeable but
[1:51:01] sharpen us Lord
[1:51:03] to where we're able to discern.
[1:51:06] And Lord, that is abiding
[1:51:09] in your light.
[1:51:11] Help us, Lord. I pray.
[1:51:14] May you, Lord, so
[1:51:18] speak and minister to every heart, Lord.
[1:51:20] Just just take it to each of us as we
[1:51:22] need it. Lord, may you just come, Lord.
[1:51:25] You're the one, the great revealer of
[1:51:27] all these things. How could we even know
[1:51:30] where to apply it, Lord, if you did not
[1:51:34] come and lead and guide us into all
[1:51:35] truth? But show us, Lord. Help us, Lord,
[1:51:38] in our homes, in our families.
[1:51:41] Help us right here, Lord, among as
[1:51:44] believers. Lord, help us, oh God.
[1:51:48] Grant to us, Lord, the grace to even be
[1:51:51] able to look into our own life
[1:51:54] to examine and say, God, how do [music]
[1:51:57] you see me? The grace, Lord, to
[1:51:59] acknowledge even our wrong and the grace
[1:52:02] to say, "God,
[1:52:04] I need more of you,
[1:52:06] oh God. Grant it, Lord."
[1:52:11] For that's what
[1:52:14] creation is longing for, that display of
[1:52:18] divine love.
[1:52:20] That's what one Bert to the Lord. He saw
[1:52:24] that display genuine
[1:52:27] in that mother deer when she knew he was
[1:52:32] over there blowing that
[1:52:35] deer call
[1:52:38] like a fawn.
[1:52:41] But she stood out there gallantly.
[1:52:44] Oh God,
[1:52:49] we're not interested in having all the
[1:52:51] right words cuz we could have all of
[1:52:53] that.
[1:52:54] But Lord Jesus, if you've got all of us,
[1:52:59] then you're the same one who broke the
[1:53:01] seals.
[1:53:03] You're the same one who revealed the
[1:53:06] secrets of the heart. Then Lord God
[1:53:10] granted Lord Jesus through our lives.
[1:53:12] Lord,
[1:53:13] it's not, Lord, that we want all of you.
[1:53:15] We want you to have all of us, Lord.
[1:53:18] IT'S NOT US CONTROLLING YOU, but we,
[1:53:20] Lord God, we long to be so controlled by
[1:53:23] you.
[1:53:26] Granted, Lord, I pray
[1:53:29] for the love of God truly
[1:53:33] produces,
[1:53:35] creates
[1:53:36] a brotherly love.
[1:53:40] Lord God, I pray
[1:53:42] let that be Lord in every heart, in
[1:53:44] every life. If there's one here or
[1:53:46] streaming or that would archive the
[1:53:48] service and they can look and say, "My,
[1:53:50] I I know I don't have it to that degree,
[1:53:52] but may they recognize that the same God
[1:53:54] that would speak to their heart and may
[1:53:57] to bring conviction is here to pour
[1:53:59] himself in as we will empty oursel out
[1:54:04] to where Lord, they would have a a love
[1:54:06] that would stand for the truth." Not
[1:54:09] just truth of doctrine, but the truth of
[1:54:13] the character of Jesus Christ. Because
[1:54:16] Lord, I don't want the doctrine apart
[1:54:18] from your character.
[1:54:22] That's where the scripture says, "The
[1:54:25] letter kleth, but the spirit giveth
[1:54:28] life."
[1:54:30] We want it together, Lord. For that's
[1:54:32] what truly
[1:54:34] you're you look for is they that would
[1:54:37] worship you in spirit and in truth. Oh,
[1:54:41] thank you, Father. Thank you for your
[1:54:43] mercies tonight, Lord. Thank you for
[1:54:46] being a faithful father.
[1:54:49] That, oh God, you would just speak to
[1:54:52] our hearts as your sons and daughters
[1:54:55] and remind us of our high calling.
[1:54:59] Oh God, you've not shamed us, but you've
[1:55:02] come to call us higher.
[1:55:05] Grant, Lord, for one of these moments
[1:55:08] soon and very soon,
[1:55:11] this character
[1:55:13] is going to be raptured.
[1:55:16] This mortal shall put on immortality.
[1:55:19] Oh God, we've got a body that'll match
[1:55:22] what's on the inside.
[1:55:25] Then Lord, there'll be the raising up
[1:55:29] that glorified body that will all will
[1:55:33] be in perfect harmony
[1:55:36] in that in that moment.
[1:55:39] We're longing for that, Lord. This is
[1:55:41] why daily in our lives, it's bringing
[1:55:44] this flesh into subjection,
[1:55:48] bringing the outer into subjection.
