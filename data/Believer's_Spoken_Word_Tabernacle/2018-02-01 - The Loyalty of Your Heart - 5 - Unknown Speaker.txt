Luthor we thank you for this opportunity and we can come and bring these prayer requests for you father we might not know all these people you know Lord we ask father especially for those Lord Lord your father go through these you might pull away from his friend pray father every prayer request today unspoken we commit all things you peeping secure boarded able to hear in every prayer [Music] children pray for a deeper if we pray free and everyone that we think not father help us Lord reach out to those we might be able to overcome [Music] no but she know you're here I sent my [Music] singing you are the gun you are the girl then he left me a mint you are the my audience oh you sent your work and you heal my disease [Music] my healer see it again you are the gun you that he left me you are the Lord my [Music] you sent your and you here my disease you are [Music] [Applause] praise the Lord everybody's got this there are some people say we cannot them rather we are saved or rather all this way say we only can trust an old man [Music] yes I know it Jesus save me the very moment he forgave took away my handy burning [Music] it's reason I'm gonna shower [Music] well I don't care who tells me salvation is not read go the world they argue to say we cannot the heavy burden lifted and the mouse and yes I know when Jesus a love every moment he forgave me took away my heavy burden and he gave me [Music] baby town [Music] I don't care who tells me this message is not well they might argue say you cannot be and the passage [Music] he took away my head burning [Music] baby touted [Music] come on church help me see one more time Jesus well he said my son oh it's real I'm gonna shower [Music] it's really loud [Music] yes hey man still believe tonight [Music] be strong [Music] baby [Music] take your land are you ready yes [Music] I'm strong [Music] yes [Music] one more time go run into the camp head everybody turn around tell someone run into the camp Tesla [Music] ready to take [Music] yes I'm ready [Music] [Music] yes people [Music] do not [Music] [Applause] [Music] god [Music] raise the name of the Lord she have illusion thank you watching hallelujah glory be to God hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus hallelujah amen what a wonderful atmosphere we just praise the name of the Lord isn't he wonderful man he's worthy he's worthy of all praise it's just such a privilege and an honor to serve you let's just go to him in a word of Prayer tonight Lord Jesus as we just come Lord into this this part Lord of the service Lord oh god how we Lord hearts are are just longing Lord to hear from you know Lord Jesus and to know that Lord that you know what we have need of and I pray that God that you just find in our hearts Lord a willingness Lord an openness Lord of tenderness Lord to you I pray that lord help us Lord to just slip now beyond the cares of this life and placed each and every request Lord that we have Lord placing it Lord God before you and Lord just looking to you for your direction in our lives and our hearts but Lord we cannot solve these things out what we can do Lord is the greatest greatest thing is to be able to commit them to you and help us we ask that God tonight that you'll just take your word speak to our hearts father let us just be removed so out of the way that you can be the speaker tonight would speak to us Lord what we have needed minister to our lives more father may you come and to each and every heart your God may it just be so personal tonight Lord as your presence Lord would just move throughout this building Lord God Lord we just give ourselves to you boy we thank you Lord for an opportunity that we have to be able to count your house Lord to a place to worship your God to be able to hear from you so help us Lord tonight we free we give you all the phrase honor glory ask Lord that you would forgive us more Lord Jesus of all our sins Lord States our shortcomings Lord father we look to you completely Lord for in you is our perfection father we love you and we thank you tonight the name of the Lord Jesus Christ god bless you tonight you would have your Bibles let's go to first Peter chapter 1 verse 3 there's Peter chapter 1 verse 3 a few verses of Scripture here where's Peter chapter 1 verse 3 does blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which according to his abundant mercy has begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time look at this in verse 6 wherein ye greatly rejoice we have something to rejoice about not what is just past but what we because of what God has done and made real in our lives we have a true home a true expectation so this is what we rejoice in this is wearing that as Peter said we greatly rejoice though now for a season if need be who determines if it needs me he does though now for a season if need be ye are in heaviness through manifold temptation sorrowful sad through many variegated ways things can come in it at the trial verse 7 of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perishing you know as if we were offering tonight would you rather have a trial of gold I'm sure if I'm sure they would pearl appeared but you don't know the circumstance for the sin no but here when we look at it through the eyes of God the trial itself is worth more than pure the trial is the trial is worth more than pure gold being much more precious than a gold that perishes though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ whom having not seen ye love in whom though now you see him not yet believing you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your soul amen may God bless you bless the reading of his word tonight may be seated we want to continue to look at that the loyalty of your heart and remembering as the Prophet where we've been bringing that from three kinds of believers and how that he would remind us that the loyalty of our heart beats the material just she's ready to go into the mall if it was not for the loyalty of our heart we would have been gone a long time ago not not the loyalty not our our will not not our resiliency the loyalty is his life pulsating through us so it's not us in our strength it's him that's the loyalty of heart it's not our humanists you know you can look at many times a great resiliency I've had things sometimes said and heard where if this individual begins serving the Lord I'll tell you what you don't have know you I tell you what you'll see an individual they'll never turn back they'll never give up that is true if God steps into the midst of that life without God I don't care they may have been so dedicated within things you may have to literally about beat them to death to stop them from going to work you might be able to have to do all these other things they have such a resiliency about themselves maybe it's a problem that a lot of times that they will go and go and go and try to solve that problem but yet all of that is human resiliency or it is natural nature given virtues that are very precious and we we thank God for that but unless those things are truly birth in us by the Spirit of God and there is a typos to keeping power by the love of God shed abroad in our hearts then there's no staying power so the loyalty of heart comes by a life that's actually been quickened by the Spirit of Almighty God it's a love affair we're not we're not here tonight because we're in fear we're not serving the Lord tonight of fear and will I may fall tomorrow know if you've been born at the Spirit of God you cannot fail God can't fail you can't fail because when God has done a work in your life whereby that you are sealed by the Spirit of God you cannot turn back there's nowhere to turn back to all bridges have been burnt you say brother Sam are you preaching that awful high I'm preaching about a personal experience is that right it's just like what I've talked about before when you can talk about nyquil I can talk about nyquil but somebody else might talk about it just by reading the label but you only know it if you tried it yourself and know what it's capable of doing I'm not advising you to go out and get nyquil but you understand what I'm saying it's my experience in our life that the reality is it's just like the song that brother Paul was wrote he wrote my inspiration something keeps holding me even within the midst of that song it was nothing about the humanists of the individual it was about the greatness of the anchor of Almighty God so we all understand that within our life if there's any glorying here tonight the real true glory is to be upon him it's him that has given us the strength to be here tonight and to live a victorious life to even be able to overcome through the darkness of trials that you have been through it is by His grace his love that would dwell in our hearts so we find that within this you know how that many times like satan did to JoVE and many times who come at us in this way to try to make us think when we're going when something we're going through that as though that it's God punishing us or it's some somehow you know that that God is so upset with us or displeased with us but when we come into that place and know that you know in our lives because there's things that you and I both know there's things sometimes that we cannot classify as trials we cannot classify as tests it's our own ignorance that's got us in some of the message that we've got into we can't claim it and say well bless God I'm suffering for the calls of the Lord and there's many times that that is true and then there's other times it's our own ignorance it's our own things that brings it on and within that right there there is a learning we can grow from that right there if we'll allow God to be able to direct us and not try to shift it off on somebody else or this or that but be able to say lord help me right now in this area Lord this is obviously a part that's a little week in my life but make me strong Lord pour yourself in to that area of my life so when we look at this we know that as God made this known to job that he made known to job that it wasn't that Satan was it wasn't God doing it but it was Satan doing it and God was permitting it to take place because he was gonna make something out of juvie and we come into our scripture tonight and how that Peter would speak to us that he has begotten unto us and begotten us unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to an inheritance incorruptible that which is a body that's reserved in the heavens that which was already there and that that's reserved for you and I it's there when we leave this life that we would go into that body that is already prepared for us when the scripture would even speak of that of being seated in heavenly places we realized that we have a representative before the throne of God that representative has always been there but you and I come to a place of recognizing of who we are and that we do have representation they're already so when we're looking at this here we are that's already reserved there are inheritance of where we are going to we've received a down pallet or a deposit or a down payment by the baptism of the holy ghost in our soul that makes us aware that we have a body that's waiting over there but here we are in this body of time that we're dwelling in and we realize that this is all for a purpose that we are where we're going but yet as Peter would say we're greatly rejoicing in what of what awaits us and what we have to look forward to and yet right now if need be for a season we're in there heaviness great sorrow and sadness there's no one of us in here and I say us that's ever been happy in the midst as far as saying I'm so happy for this trial there's not one of us but the reality is more now listen to me the more has God is bringing his word to our hearts what is it doing it's maturing us as we allow the word to have its way in our life to where when these things come about that we're able to look back and allow the Spirit of God to bring this to our mind to where that you and I are settled to allow God and say Lord I don't understand what's going on I don't know what's working out here but I know this one thing that my destiny is sure I know one thing that is sure I know where I'm doing I know where I come from I don't know what is all going on right here but you know what you're doing and even though that I would not have signed up for this trial but you seen it was me be you seen that it was need be so within it the Prophet takes it like this and who is this milk esident when a man is born again from heaven he becomes a spirit babe in Christ and when this robe of flesh is dropped there is a natural body of theophany a body not made with hands neither born of a woman that we go to then that body returns back and picks up the glorified that's the reason Jesus went to hell when he died and preached to the souls that were in prison he turned back into the orphan II oh how marvelous think God in 2nd Corinthians 5:1 if this earthly body be dissolved this earthly Tabernacle we have another one see we have bypassed that to come straight from God the attribute to be flesh to be tempted and tested by sin like Adam did but when testing of his word is over Gorillaz that's what we're tested born is his word because as as tests and trials are permitted the enemy always has some sort of a voice that he wants to try to say concerning their trial the prophet have just heard it this morning of possessing the enemy's gate after trial he said in every part in Abraham's life he said the enemy was right there to talk to him of regarding the trials he went through the enemy is always there he don't all of a sudden back off he don't back off because while they've been walking in the message for this man here he don't back off as a matter of fact you could have whooped that guy a black and designed everything he'll be right back at the door tomorrow morning o people could only be that faithful we don't want to be Devils but the devil is always there is that right the devil never misses church the devil never misses an opportunity listen that guy's ready when you wake up a morning bound to hit you he's ready he tries to make use of every opportunity to try to do what break your confidence hallelujah but when testing of this of his word is over then we are taken up to this body that was prepared for us before the foundation of the world it is the word there that we skip to come right around and down here to be tempted and testing if we'd have come through that there have been no Tim we denote all things that's the reason Jesus known all things he was he was the word before he was flesh then we become the word now watch what he says here here we are formed to the word image see there's a forming in our life that reflects that other world that we are a part of we are being formed to the word image not our flesh but being formed to the word image that likeness that reflection I think of how the Prophet would place it in God in simplicity in jeffersonville when he says let us so characterize and live our lives now as if we were already in that other city let us let us characterize our lives now and live as though we were already there here we are formed to the word image to be a partaker of the word feed on the word by being predestinated since the beginning you know you are ordained to this diet of the word the other things you tried to eat it just would not satisfy you could heat it it would leave you empty but there's something about the word it's because you and I were a part of that word it it has a satisfying part you begin to partake of the word and and the words coming from I that just sounds like something I I just I really love that I it some things are making sense and what is that it's God Himself wooing and drawing on our life you're partaking of it and then eventually as you become a feeder on the word itself what are you feeding you are feeding on that diet of the word and what's it doing it is forming you into the word image the feeding all together does not form you and I but the feeding gives us the nutrients and the strength that in the formation process we are able to be able to yield ourselves to him Alleluia by being predestinated since the beginning you see that little spark of life that you had on you from the beginning when you started your journey he said many of you can remember it you join this church and join that church you tried this and that nothing satisfied but one day you just recognized it in Hebrews 10 verse 32 Paul's have been called to remembrance the former days in which after ye were illuminated he endured a great fight that word fight means combative hard trials contested he endured a great fight of afflictions when after you were illuminated enlightened made to shine something that was there as it would say in the Greek something that was there now brought forth in light after you were illuminated so now you're new can't blend in you stand out what's made you stand out light you've been illuminated you've been lit up and one time blending in but now it's lit up you didn't light it God let you up but there was something there that could be ignited for glory he didn't ignite our flesh that will wear out he didn't ignite our spirit battle we're out on a windy day panel blowout but he ignited our soul he immersed us in the divine oil of His Holy Spirit and he set us on fire here we are in between the oil in between the fire but devil cannot get you out of there you've been illuminated by Almighty God amen where you drawn your strip to be illuminated from from the oil your roots are in the oil your wit is in the oil after you were illuminated you endured a great fight of afflictions partly whiles you were made of gazing stock brought on stage both by reproaches suffering and afflictions and partly while you became companions of them that were so used so you become part of something you became on stage now is your time your part your role has been called to be acted out it's time to act your part out but thank God that we're not acting on our own strength thank god there's one who is present to act in you and I but the only thing he needs to do is us to yield and then he can act out the exact character or the characterization of the word that's supposed to be aren't you glad now let's take a little trip again here tonight then we're gonna maybe put our hard hats on here for a little bit more and we're gonna deal with certain things a little bit more with steel because I know some of you here you're aware of this already but I got to really just thinking upon my heart the thought just dropped in my heart when that which is actually brought forth the steel and the iron and those things right there what process itself must it go through before it can ever be tempered that bethe thought they just dropped on my heart I said Lord well let me go look and let's see what that is so let's take a look tonight in the metal hardening and I know some of these words will be beyond our head but we'll try to make them simple here tonight the use of this treatment in metal hardening will resort or result in an improvement of the mechanical properties as well as an increase in the level of hardness producing a tougher more durable item alloys are heated above the critical transformation temperature for the material then cooled rapidly enough to cause the soft initial material to transform to a much harder stronger structure so there needs to be a transformation first a transformation from the soft material that's there there must be a transformation and it takes the critical transformation temperature aren't you glad that God knows the temperature in May aren't you glad he didn't reduce the temperature in this age it's the same temperature the same critical transformation temperature that was given on the Pinnacle's it's the same transforming temperature that comes down and brings transformation alloys may be air cooled or cooled by quenching in oil water or another liquid depending upon the amount of alloying elements and the material harden materials are usually tempered or stress relief to improve their dimensional stability and toughness steel parts often require a heat treatment to obtain improved mechanical properties such as increasing hardness increased hardness or strength the hardening process consists of he Denis of heating the components above the critical normalizing temperature holding at this temperature for 1 hour per inch of thickness cooling had a rate fast enough to allow the material to transform to a much harder stronger structure and then tempering so there's a process before temporary what we're reading about here tonight is tempering but there is a process that you must go through that will make you temporal there's a process that we have been brought into whereby that we can actually be tempered in this process is where that there is developed a hardness not a hardness of hard what what a contrasting what a contrasting thought in one way it's not a hardness of heart but it's a steadfastness of his faith in our life by real personal experience oh my notice it goes on to say steel is essentially an alloy of iron and carbon other steel alloys have other metal elements in solution heating the material above the critical temperature causes carbon and the other elements to go into solid solution quenching freezes the microstructure inducing stresses parts are subsequently tempered to transform the microstructure and achieve the appropriate hardness and eliminate the stresses so there's before there's a tempering there's got to be a quenching but when a quenching has happened a hardening for for this material then it's ready to go into the tempering stage but in the quenching part when the material is actually quenched as we read here there is actually there is a micro structure where stresses are induced let me tell you this right here before you and I were born of the Spirit of God we could slap along and everything else but once you have been born of the Spirit of God you no longer are just a one part being you have become a two part being a man in your soul dwells the very deity of Almighty God and yet out here in your body now comes in the great ruling force at one time you were ruled by the Prince and power of the air and one time you were under its subjection but now you have received of the divine authority by the indwelling of his Spirit whereby you can mortify the deeds of the body you can make your body obey the Word of God by what by that power that is laying within you oh there are stresses that are there where at one time there was no war the one day the Prophet said when you have been born in the Spirit of God you're in a constant war from that time on constant war we're not in my soul but a constant war there stresses us there why this is what God could say I'll give you a new heart a new spirit and I will put my spirit in you and cause you to keep my ways but God knows how to reduce the stresses once he's got us quenched then it's time for tempering anybody want to sign up for tempering metal quenching let's look at that quenching a little bit more material is heated up to the suitable temperature and then quenched in water or oil to harden to full hardness according to the Chi materials so it's a two-step process it's got to be heated to a certain spot and then it's quenched in the water or the oil well in our case water and oil represents the holy spirit it's the same God it's the same one that what's it done moving up on a lot getting our lives in the heat my the heat of the word here you come and you're hearing the word and my the heat of the word just coming you know what I don't need to live this way no more I want to serve Almighty God what's he doing he's heating you up he's heating you up he's warming you up what's he doing drawing you unto himself it's a whole part of the quenching process but after warming you up and getting you to that critical point to where there's nothing else that matters in your life then he says it's ready for the solution hallelujah material is heated to the suitable temperature for hardening then cooled rapidly by immersing the hot part in water oil or another suitable liquid to transform the material to a fully hardened structure so just being warmed up it's not the quenching process but part of the quenching process is being warmed up to a place then it's ready to go in the oil or the water parts which are quenched Omaha usually must be aged tempered or stress relieved to achieve the proper toughness final hardness and dimensional stability Lori you're no longer just we would say as though just aware of this dimension you become aware of another dimension you believe that the prophet of God tells us that nough in the Patmos vision he said I want you to watch John being a spirit-filled man and because she was spirit filled the angel that was sent to him could come and talk to him he said see when you have been born of the Spirit of God you're no longer just a one part being you become a twofold being and the supernatural God is able to send His angels to you and talk to you because you believe what they're saying you're no longer just living in this world it becomes like the Lord Jesus I am in this world but I'm not of this world glory be to God so you've been heated to a certain spot kind of like taking cucumbers and heating them up to a certain spot you heat him up to a certain spot boiling water but you just don't want to heat up and eat hot cucumbers it's the objective isn't to heat him up just to heat him up but the objective is is to make pickles out of so you'll heat them up in that boiling water till a certain spot and then they go in the vinegar solution then they're quenched or I can say satisfied they don't want no more of the world are you with me there first has been satisfied what they were longing for the thirst that made him room here and do that and do that it was a thirst that was calling for something that was satisfy something that could quench that thirst and God Himself brought you and I into the quenching process but after the quenching process as we just read we've got to be aged mature because we're born a spirit babe in Christ we've got to be aged or formed into the word image tempered or stress relief what's the stress what's the tension it ain't God it's when the word starts dealing with us come on somebody is when it starts dealing with us it starts getting down where that things that you and I can see called bringing it to light in your sing Lord help me Lord help me like God changed me shape me Lord God God will allow those stresses to be there maybe it's our own reliance how did we handle things I don't need nobody else's help just me and God wow I don't know where that fits at in Scripture but the one thing I do need I need Almighty God and he might use one of you all to speak to me and to help me because you wanna know why we are a body so I need him and I need every gift he's got if I am his bride you believe you're his bride then we must by receiving every gift he sends we prove were his bride you with me his bride does not have a diamond on her finger that only has one gift come on somebody and the message oneness the Prophet said she proves she is the bride by receiving every one of his gifts glory be to God hallelujah you see sometimes people are wanting to you you to receive what they have to say and they're skeptical of everything else everybody else says to them how can you expect your word to be received when you yourself are skeptical but see God knows how to work on you and I and I'm so glad about that he knows how to temper after we've been quenched Lord God temporal way Lord Jesus my flesh is not crying out for tempering but my soul says the Lord temper me a temper me Lord God Who am I now notice this in Exodus 3 verse 2 the angel of the Lord appeared on the in speaking of Moses in a flame of fire out of the bush out of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the bush was not concerned there's not one of you in here not want to be including me that we would ever think about lighting up a bush and you know times around the edges of our properties and other stuff like that they're dry right now they're dry you can light them up nobody would think about lighting a bush on fire but this was not a man-made fire this was a fire by the angel of the Lord and it was burning this bush was burning with fire it wasn't some little flame it was but yet the bush itself wasn't consumed what was God's showing you and I the miracle of the new birth where the fire of God can move down in our soul and yet here we are a part of us has been consumed but yet the rest of us here we are new creation in the same Oh in the message the angel beloit when God spoke to him and attracted his attention about tiller fire that fell into a bush and begin to burn and pop and burn it looks like if it was a fire it would have scorched the bush or burned it but it was a supernatural fire who could burn the bush and yet it would still be there I'm thankful tonight for a supernatural the Holy Spirit God's flame of fire who could come down in the human heart and burn out all the sin and unbelief it don't harm the person but it purchase him it makes him grow greater be stronger more faith and he comes tonight in that same way glory be to God so this was a type of you and I hope he can come down into a human body and drive out the power of cancer tumor cataract tuberculosis with fire heavenly holy spirit fire falling from God out of heaven why that's no mystery if he can burn inbred sin out how much more can he burn cancer out by the same Holy Spirit amen the same Holy Ghost that burnt-out inbred sin is the same Holy Ghost we have been quenched quenched quits for what temporary made ready for the molding and shaping process the semi you mean to tell me when I was born again that I did not receive my character you receive the life of his character and their life of his character works with Union you and I to bring forth his character but there's no way that that character can be produced without suffering without test and without trials that's God's oh my look at this here in God's provided way of fellowship brother never said Daniel in the presence of the lions maintained his fellowship the Holy Spirit come right and lived down there with him talked with him all night the Hebrew children in the fiery furnace hot fire that even killed the men that throat' him in the heat of the furnace killed him in that throw them in but they maintained their fellowship look at this now the devil cannot put a trial upon you too hard unless you maintain that fellowship if you've come God's provided way of approach you're a son of God the world's burn out of you you've entered into the Shekinah glory the Spirit of God is in your heart we're not bragging on ourselves we're bragging on his work there's not a trial he can put on you are i as a son and daughter of God that has been burned that's been burned on the inside out and filled with this power there's not a trial too hard for my son trials home our trials there'd been many trials that have been way harder I'll put it like this every trial has been harder than what my spirit or my flesh because it has not been my flesh or my spirit it hasn't been your flesh or your spirit it's the soul that holds steady in the midst of it even when you would go to start questioning why or your mind starts wondering have I done something have I done something displeasing to him why why is this happening all of a sudden you'll find yourself you'll catch yourself it isn't you as far as a person but there's a wind that comes it's something that rises up from within you to be able to say Lord you're directing this and when that happens you feel smitten you feel smitten because they even allow a thought but remember that thought was not your thought Oh glory so here I'm not gonna read this next section here brother Bryan almost skip here in just a minute I'll let you normally go but Steel's it goes into this section here I don't want to read it I just want to refer to it but it goes on to talk about how Steel's themselves are now are never used in the quenched condition they've got to be tempered but the quenching is necessary God knows what he's preparing for our lives that's saying that the quenching isn't real but God's tempering and molding and shaping you and I getting us ready for all of those appointments in life are you with me you could not take David David had an experience but David had a line and David had a bear you see before Goliath who was that that was God the Bible says when God led Israel out of Egypt he led them out of Egypt and he didn't lead them in the way of the Philistine by the coast Lester people would get discouraged but yet he let him in a way that was trial after trial test after test places where they had nowhere to turn no way to run to they had him he was proven to them all those stages along the journey was God proving himself to Israel that I who brought you out I brought you this far I will keep you safe along amen God was letting it be known to them I've watched over you you couldn't have brought yourself out of Egypt your power could not have liberated you but I came down and liberated you he brought him each step of the way you know God as we live we we we looked at that some weeks ago God leads Bible says that the Lord Jesus himself walking up out of the water and the heavens open the Bible said he was led out of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted it was led they see these these tests and trials are not just happenstance --es they are ordained because God knows you and I he knows the character that lays in our life he knows your disposition he knows my disposition and he knows exactly how to work in our lives to bring out after we've been quenched and the micro structure of stresses beyond human eyes he knows how to temper age and relieve those stresses trials trials would be a relief of stress it's how we look at it I don't know about you but tests and trials sometimes when I go through tests and trials my body feels it sometimes things come out you know and whatever more you know the things you think mild feeling pretty good I never ill I was under that much stress you're with me sometimes it'll take sleep from your body it'll take your appetite you probably look at me and say I don't think it's that's yours buddy maybe it made me think more about food I don't know oh I need another little lip I mean another ho ho another rest you all are like that my goodness y'all you almost have a praise and worship service when you're going through your tests and trials actors sometimes it keeps you up sometimes you have to battle the stretch because the stress would want to come right into your home and you have to battle the way you ran but the whole time wait a minute I cannot allow this to affect my home here you are being molded and shaped and here you are at the same time God didn't put you up on a in a sleeper and just say just stay up there I'll do all the work just right here no you and I are not just if I could say like this we're not just lifeless images we have feelings we have parts about our life stresses and how many tell you this right here but real stresses it ain't nobody else but me it's parts in my life parts in your life you understand God isn't giving me a trial that all of a sudden that you know it'll somehow change somebody else know God allows me to be changed what's he trying to do reduce me reduce you but if we can get reduced God can do things that Samuel don't know nothing about Seurat so this tempering and temperature there's a final product to be produced now go down brother Brian where the heading it says why what is quenching and tempering let me just read in there a little bit quenching and tempering are processes that strengthen and harden materials like steel and other iron based alloys the process of quenching or quench hardening involves heating the material and then rapidly cooling in water oil forced air or inert gases such as nitrogen the process is tightly controlled with the heating temperature cooling method cooling substance and cooling speed all depending upon the type of material being quenched and the desired hardness God knew the process that you and I needed after look at this now after the material has been quenched to its hardest state the process of tempering is used to achieve greater toughness and ductility by decreasing so wait a minute I'm to be brought to a place of hardness and then I'm to be reduced there's a part of you and me that had to be brought to hardness and then there's a part of you and I that's got to be reduced in hardness I must decrease that he might increase glory be to God tempering I'll get to some of these words in a minute tempering is achieved by heating the quenched material to below of a critical point for a set period of time then allowing it to cool in still air oh my now for a season anybody see what day that winter's started on no you didn't I didn't either he wasn't on the first snowfall it fades from one season to another you can look and I can look out my window and say boy I'm waiting on spring I'm looking for spring I've got it out hold it'll feed in and just as quick as it fades in it'll fade out seasons come in seasons go out it's like the ages they don't have abrupt stopping they overlap it's why with trials tempering in our life there isn't things of abrupt stopping there's a coming in and then there's a fading out it didn't just automatically stops it fades in and I know some of you just like me you're wondering saying Lord is it gonna fade in stronger it's very strong right now it's pretty hot right now Lord but he says I know what stresses I'm trying to relieve in your life stresses Lord I've asked for peace and comfort but I told you through my prophet I gave you the best comfort you could have tests and trials that's the greatest thing that could happen to you but in our mind we say Lord the best thing would be to me is there a hotel Lord that not only provides Linens but it is stress-free environment when I go into their Lord God I forget about everything you could be on an island and be stressed this life was not meant to be easy I know we all listen we all appreciate the times of reprieve don't we we appreciate when the trial or the temptation is over and God knows after that we need ministering to we love that we appreciate that we look forward to win that is over with but in the meantime it's like as the Prophet could tell us Lord don't take the trials from me but just give me your grace just give me your grace in order to go through mama here in the benefits of quenching in tempered plate y'all gonna be applying for some another job Stan aren't you you be signing up man for benefits of quenched and tempered plate you're not thinking about that are you brother you no no no now tempting at all is it no by tempering quenched still it becomes less brittle and more ductile without sacrificing too much hardness now these are things that when I've studied this here that these people are bragging on that steel that is present now it's steel that's quenched and tempered being even more resilient than in times past it is the combination of these two processes notice the combination of these two processes that produces a harder tougher steel that's more weldable and ductile than ordinary carbon steel let me tell you something you're not ordinary carbon steel you are sought out you have been sought out and brought to him and he is quenched you that he might temper you and me but he wants to make this steel path hard but yet it's got to also have to be weldable to be ductile or pliable so this weldable what weldable itself means in case you don't know the word it means to join together like taking pieces and joining them together by heating to the point of melting using a blowtorch or electric art or other means uniting them by pressing and hammering so in other words it's the unifying or unity bringing unity so you mean that how that the tempering process would work on you and me would make us weldable well I don't need no other part of the body oh yes you do we need one another the foot cannot say to the hand I don't need you you are not the whole body in yourself and neither am i but we are a part of the body baptized by one spirit into the body and then the stress is in our life my if God could have just sent me in a church with the pastor according to my molding if God could have just made it so everybody in the church was just like me god forbid god forbid that everybody was like me I got enough problems with me you see it's usually the things that we choose are the things we don't need but our choosing is to be directed by Almighty God because God knows exactly what we need it's not us that knows what we need Oh God this word this message is should never make you our self-reliant self dependent if it is it's the wrong spirit as a matter of fact when it's correctly revealed it reveals to you and I our need of total depend see on him what I need you more now than I ever did Lord God I'm more realize a more aware of that part of my life that need to be more weldable it's easy to be weldable with people of like precious temperaments oh they mean I mean like precious faith lot precious dispositions they think like me they think like you I mean that's just God right no God has a sense of humor he'll put together a conglomeration and alloy of quenched vessels and then he works to weld us together but how does he work to make you and I weldable he works on you in your parts and he works on me in my parts he didn't just you know it didn't just me saying Lord you need to work on this guy he's not weldable Lord we're calling him Lord got poured on him Lord pouring on him making weldable Lord know the real reality if there's something about brother Enoch that's rubbing it ain't brother Enoch it's me it's stress that needs to be relieved how is it relieved by the overcomer dwelling in you and us surrendering to the overcomer and then that's how we overcome Peter God I don't think they ever taught this and what's that safety classes osha or something like that mercy you realize you needed safety glasses in here tonight he needed some gloves to be able to handle this word as it was coming it allows you weldability is known as being joint ability so the word itself coming and working in our lives dealing with our lives bringing us to a place to say lord I need more of you and the suffering the molding the testing trial what's God doing God's will Deniz body together suffering or not to drive us apart come on somebody persecution does not drive the body of Christ apart it draws the body together God knows exactly what to do to do what caused the body to draw together I'm asked you to I'm gonna say this like this if God allowed everything right here in this church if everything went 100% right on nobody had any tests or trials we never had to pray about anybody losing the job we never had to pray about sickness or whatever more we would be such spoiled brats there were nobody want to ever come here and sit down because you want to know why God wouldn't be here because the church that is not being tested or tried the prophets words is the church that does not have it so it's testing that's trying it's things that are gone what is that that's vindication of the life within you it proves the life that is there within you joint ability how many would say Lord make me more weldable I got both my hands up making me more weldable Lord not more routable with the people that I'm weldable with let me just say this very clearly there's going to be people right here look in the body of Jesus Christ they're not going to be your best buddies but neither are those two somehow that are your best buddies should there ever come a clannish spirit among you that's not weldability let's be clear on that that's called a weak link we don't have a million Gospels here there's one gospel we preach it's the gospel of Jesus Christ it's not the gospel of Samuel Browning not the gospel of joy bell's not the gospel of john Kadima not the gospel of enoch Kadima it is one gospel the gospel of Jesus Christ so there is one motive one objective and that's the unity of the body even where Paul himself in intercessory prayer could say in Philippians 2 his prayer was that we would filled with boughs of mercy like-minded toward one another well what's gonna be what's gonna bring that about temporary oh I agree the quenching will make will make tuxedos and bib Dover holes hug I agree but we've got to do more than hug we've got to walk together we've got to be able to fight together we've got to be able to live under the same roof and see one another's faults come on somebody in the Hebrew series the Prophet said you backslide on the people at church but you never backslide on God your backside on the people the church why the people the church can see it but you don't backslide on Christ you said you backslide on Christ you don't backslide on God go I God can't see you so we've got to be able to look you know how it is you get married now all of a sudden you have only seen the carols now you see the curlers you've seen what made the curls honey you look perfect in those pink curlers it just does something about your countenance you as me weldability none of us are signing up for weldability but yet we're from the inside lord I know I need to be more weldable so in order for to be more radical it isn't brother--he not you need to let this down in your life you need to know it's right here it's the stress that needs to be relieved right we're not talking about faking things friends like people if you've really got love if you really got love bless caught you ought to go over there that's called force-feeding love is not an action don't you reduce the love to be an action that way love itself must be can in the heart and if it starts in the heart you might be praying about something you might have a loved one or somebody that you've offended something that's been said and you might all of a sudden I just need to go talk to first of all make sure your heart is set right if not it's just hypocrisy even though your design it's got to be love you know the Prophet said this the scripture said this the Prophet said this that's all true Ben in order for all that to come you must die I want to be weldable Lord I want to be weldable when the fire comes on to reduce that stress to where that I'm able to come into there and be joined together my you mean this isn't just gifted no we're gifted to be able to submit here's the other part my lord we're time go don't say you know either it makes you more ductile dr. which is to be pliable pliant flexible supple plastic a tensile soft malleable workable bendable the opposite of brittle it hurt my feelings brittle don't mean you ain't been quenched when you've been quenched you're still brittle that's where the tempering has to remove the brittleness well this didn't go according to how I think it brittle brittle skál I've just got a stab gotta tell it brittle be careful you're not classifying things as the word and yet it's brittleness on your part lord help me be more pliable pliable means to wait on him be more malleable shapeable flexible y-you mean you don't want me to be rigid no he wants you to be tough but God doesn't want us to be without emotion without feeling you don't want things done without feeling he corrected his profit on that he wants what is truth to be done with feeling it is that right speaking the truth in love to make pliable malleable shapeable oh my I just got into this here my lord ductility a material as a measure of a materials ability to undergo significant plastic deformation before rupture ductility is often characterized by the materials ability to be stretched into a wire hmm didn't know you was able to be that long-suffering missus suffer its measured on the point of that plastic deformation how what is the limit we can take this thing before it deforms god knows the limits it's up to you and I before he ever starts oh lord stop you're stretching me too much Lord Lord it's too much honey put my hands on you yet Lord you stretch missile but he wants to make us it's not necessarily him stretching us he wants to make us let us send me round with me going through a trial make me a little bit more ductile well I'll tell you one one way one way is you could look at somebody else's trial and you could look at it there's nothing let's say I don't know why in the world they're always sick someone so sick okay what if they had faith and they just believed God they wouldn't be sick hmm wonder what hospital you're gonna be in I'm serious friends I wonder what God's going to allow to come your way because the one is being quoted and what's being said I don't find that to be out of that attitude or a heart that's ductile I find it to be out of something that's arrogant and God will allow you to see how it is how is that how is that if they just have faith how is that do you realize friends when a person themselves may endure with the disease or a sickness it is not that they do not have faith faith itself your healing you might have there might be setting in that condition right there and God would allow and permit that but remember God is faithful the faith is is that that faith will bring you to your healing whether it's in this body or the next body power transformation the Prophet looks down and recognizes the woman who is in the wheelchair and he said think of this lovely young lady we pray for her and steel she sits there in that wheelchair he said possibly how God has formed this beautiful young flower and yet she stands here sits here happy God proves and says see there's people and I may not move every little thing for them but that doesn't matter to them they're not in love with me because they got straight legs they're in love with me because of me not what I can do for him that's real faith I said that's real faith listen friends there's people who has that faith to be healed Mira and yet not faith to walk with the Lord I ask you what would you rather be faith to have everything your healing and everything else or would you rather to have a faith that resonates with inside of your heart a loyalty that beats out that stands there in the face of everything and says who who shall separate us from the love of God Paul didn't mess up there when he didn't say what he said who because it's who that comes through all of those other having us God knows what he's doing and he'll do that part to bring a little bit of humility our way you know why because He loves us he's looking at us and saying you know what with that kind of an attitude you're not weldable son with that kind you're not you're not you don't have no ductility you're not malleable pliable you've already got your mind formed up malleability a similar property is a materials ability to deform under compressive stress that is often characterized by the materials ability to form a thin sheet the hammering or rolling these properties are known as plasticity which is the quality of being easily shaped or moment I wonder tonight in us in our lives where does our plasticity rank on his scale but what matters is is that either begun the good work he's gonna finish no matter where our plasticity is tonight our able to be molded and shaped he's gonna get the job done and he's gonna bring us to the place of submission that he can work because he ain't gonna do it by force he leads us your loving look at these things here that they make this this toughness factor these measures you got them slides up there brother have the PowerPoint if you don't have it that's okay I'll go on some of these things right here well I could get my glasses on I came to see these things look at this storage tank bridges and high-rise building how many of you glad that bridges have some quenched and tempered steel or would you say I don't matter clenched is good enough no it's got to be quenched and tempered you did you all do you all see signs on bridges let's say quenched only you got seats in you guys see signs on stinks to see quenched only not temporary they don't have to put those signs on there because if they've made it to there that's what they have been purposed all of the heating all of the cooling has been with the product in mind and God already has taken a picture of you and I he knows exactly what he's bringing forth in our life he already knows the outcome so he's working through all the testing and the cooling to bring forth wouldn't it be terrible if it was a loader bucket like that third one right there and it was not able to handle abrasions every time I went to scoop up earth big old marks what put in it say Lord Jesus I want to be sensitive but I don't want to wear my feelings or my arms I have feelings you got feelings there right but lord help me help me that isn't something that he does for us he brings us in through that place we're never going to be without feelings in our life but we are coming into a place to where we don't allow our feelings to dominate us go to the next one gear wheels I know you're glad for those gear wheels on the elevator oh yeah see God makes gears we're gears of a timepiece the gears are all going together to tell the time it works together than to see how that even those liners of a dump truck my lord liner of a dump truck I don't want to be a line of a dump truck David said I would rather be a doorkeeper the Prophet picks it up and calls it a doormat at the house of God now you know I've had carpets at my door when you walk in and you go to wipe your feet on them they follow you all the way through the house because you want to know why they're not held down well we want to be doormats where the feet can be wiped on it if I say Amen I want to be a good liner go to Samuel I'm the bride of Jesus Christ woo Wow chutes carry precious things cargo the cold other things a low loader trailer my good what wait you're built to handle the weight the stresses balloons you don't think so I don't think so but I'll say what he said I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me if he has given me a trial or giving you a trial I'm gonna hear what he said through the Prophet to me it shows God's got confidence because he's doing something he knows what he's bringing out in our life let me leave you with this I'm closing I am let me just can I leave you with these scriptures and quote whether you said Amen listen Romans 12:1 think of this think of the template think of the tempering in our lives I beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect God this isn't just us changing our thinking it's renewing of the Holy Ghost renewing our transformation I love this quote that's what we all want to do be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of our mind to do the perfect and acceptable will of God now that we have been saved as we are and that we have been filled with the Holy Spirit as we have now we want the mind that was in Christ to be in us well brothers had you what happened when we've been born again isn't that the mind of Christ it is but we still use our mind too much and not his mind so he knows how to relieve the stress now we want the man that was in Christ to be in us that we might be transformed from the natural things of life and be brought in to do the perfect will of God by transformation of God's Spirit by his word so I've been saved filled with the Holy Ghost now to have the mind of Christ operating in us to do what bring us from the natural things transform us by his Spirit by his word I'll say this he's doing a good job I feel so small in saying that but I know this right here I can testify he does all things he's brought forth all of those who lived down through time he's brought them to where he had them to be God kept working with Abraham renewing renewing renewing he's still working on you he's still working on me the test the trial God is for us let him quench you and you've been quenched let him temporary send Lord Jesus true we could be sad we can be sorrowful the test the trial we don't feel like rejoicing at the trial but we can pray and that's what we should do the Bible says in the book of James if any that's afflicted let him pray let's pray or Jesus we thank you tonight Lord God for your mercy Lord Jesus Lord as we look into these things I know Lord a lot of the words even when I first looked over these words Lord these things when it dropped in my heart Lord and weeks weeks ago Lord I looked at him Lord I loved him on that's what a quite a process but more Jesus what it comes down to this is how the understanding when it's in that time your desire and what you're doing with intestine trials or God your tempering us or Jesus we've been quenched what if there's one here tonight this is not been quenched they can receive that quenching tonight Lord an anchor Lord Jesus were thankful because we know that it is that blessed anchor of the soul Lord Jesus as we go through the tests in the trials the Lord we looked at it last week we're either coming in one or we're going out of one sometimes the Lord it seems like the duration between them sometimes it seems like there's not even any duration he's just overlapping Oh Lord I asked you to help us help us to be submissive Lord to you the Lord God what you are desiring to achieve might be achieved in our lives Lord God the manifold temptation variegated coming in a variety of manners and what God or Jesus we look at these things or God and we know that every one of these tests in these trials they're personally tailored for us or there's an achievement that you have for our lives or God in love we trust you or you know what you're doing Lord you know Lord God what's being brought forth out of our life to where we can be more have more joy nobility more weldability Lord God help us Lord or God may the stresses within ass Lord God may they be reduced Lord those tensions Lord God of our makeup in our Oh God let that macrostructure Lord God we're trusting in you Lord renewing us or God a renewing of our mind as Peter could say do not be fashioned again lakyn to the world in ignorance Lord God we want to be changed we want to be molded we want to be shaped more dawn that our character is so coming to a place where God every being received Lord and ready we have confidence Lord not in ourselves but in you that you know exactly what we need Lord just like Lord God those that steal that we show there on those eight pictures there was a desired product the way that they shaped that steel the way that they took it through the tempering process it was made with the product that it was going to be [Music] or God you know Lord in our lives you even know Lord God even in the next month the next year you know exactly Lord God even the tests and trials and those things right now Lord God and how it's molding it's shaping us Lord God preparing us lord god help us lord help us Lord to have more ductility Lord to be more malleable Lord to be more pliable Lord God not to be so brittle ward we're trusting in you Lord God or Jesus it's nobody else's brittleness the brittleness that bothers me is Samuel help me Lord God Lord Jesus I'm depending on you Lord God and I'm thankful Lord God I believe in our hearts it ought to be one thing the Lord even as we're looking at the molding and shaping we ought to rejoice to be able to realize Lord God that you have begun the good work will perform in unto the day of Jesus Christ we ought to rejoice in that we recognize that it's us who needs to be changed not my brother not my sister it's us we need to be changed your God and you place things so in such a way nor God but that's because the Lord it's you're working the Bible says you have sent in the body all of the members in particular help us lord I pray we need you Lord Jesus here tonight Lord I have my hands up I need you Lord Lord all the tests and trials the Lord Jesus Lord AHA say it like this they haven't got easier the Lord they've become greater the more as we walk along Lord they become greater but help us Lord God help us in the midst of it Lord but our attitude would be right your prophet tells us in the Hebrew series this is our proving grounds and that you permit the tests and trials to come our way to see what attitude we'll take toward them Oh God help us Lord forgive us Lord when we've taken the wrong attitude Lord help us Lord I believe that's what you're doing you're taking your word and you're speaking to our hearts Lord you're teaching us as your prophet told us Lord that we would not be untutored but we would be tutored believers teaching us he said it's necessary that he would teach us that we must suffer we need to be taught more teach me Lord Jesus thank you Lord God for these services I know Lord they might be looked at Lord is simple I'm glad they are I just want to be simply submissive to him Lord I want to be simple enough to say lord help me Lord I want to grow up Lord I want to grow up into you in all things help us the Lord God we love you we thank you Lord Jesus the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen lucious staying unless you sing just a few moments if we could didn't throw yes [Music] thank you lord [Music] and it's all because Jesus [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] ah [Music] MPN broken mg [Music] ah [Music] so I see [Music] [Music] that's all [Music] [Applause]
