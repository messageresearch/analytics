Lord this morning and you know it wouldn't be even though we've set it aside this is a place that the Lord has given us to come together but it would be no more than just a building if it wasn't his presence but it's his presence that takes a building that would be just made of these bricks could have went and made any building that could have been anything that's been here but it's his presence you know there was a place at one time of a particular church that we knew of and things like that actually we had been there and things and you know after a time where the the ministry did not walk on in with with the Lord and it came to a time that I you know I what I've heard where the individual after I know my dad had spoken and there was some things that that the Lord had letting my dad to deal with and speak on and after after leaving there there was an old Saint and I remember he's only gone to the glory and he said you know because of some things that had to wear that were addressed he said he looked at his he looked at his wife he said mama he said tonight he said Inka bonds been wrote on this door and I'll tell you what happened there and it wasn't because of my dad it was just simply because that you walk on him with the word and what happened there that that place of worship became a dance hall the Prince of the Lord is a very precious thing we always want to reverence it always want to reverence it there might be things and how that the Lord will take the servant of God here this morning and through incoming services and if we just look to the Lord there might be things and how God is moving within that service and sometimes we know it may not seem like it's moving right down our channel but you know what God knows what our need is and you know I wonder when the Lord Jesus was walking down as them among their to the Pool of Bethesda I wonder even maybe that that man that was there that was sitting there there was there was impotent I wonder if he just didn't see the Lord Jesus coming but he didn't know what it was really all about until the Lord Jesus started talking to him you know that's something to how God will come right down through his word and God will take something's it's familiar to us it might be a familiar text it can be something you've heard just in the message this week something the Lord is laid on your heart you've been meditating on but then you find as he draws near he speaks and ministers right to your need he knows right where you're at this morning knows right your need he's mindful of it and we believe we believe he cares how great is his care how great is his love what we want to do is just surrender we want to enter on into it amen is such a wonderful privilege to be in the presence of the Lord amen just thank God for His mercy thing God for by the Jerian sister Mina and Lydia and the grandchildren they brought with them they brought a few with them but we're grateful to have a book Jerry go ahead and come on and we're just we're glad glad to have them here with us and I know that I know there's some that's even probably even more glad than the rest but for the bill sister Mary and her mom and dad but we're just we're thankful amen let's just let's pull on the gift of God now I've asked the Lord when he came here I prayed with him yesterday I asked that God would just really refreshing why they're here but I also want to get everything that God has for me amen and I know what God has for me and has for you it doesn't lay particularly in the individual but it lays in the Lord is that right so that's who we're going to be pulling on we'll be pulling on the Lord Jesus Christ and there many times how God will use you know God will use experiences right through a person's life and God will have certain store sometimes that said in a manner and it'll help open things for you and I we see that all the way through the scripture God will allow things where he comes down and he'll speak in our language things that we can relate to he don't have to but he conned in sins I'm so glad he does that aren't you Amen that's what we want him to do we want him to move right up and down these aisles moving our hearts and our lives and just really speak to us in a personal way amen amen what a wonderful time to be in serving the Lord and in the presence of the Lord amen I'm

trials and have learned a lot of things and have growing and God has blessed my family and I'm thankful for that it's always wonderful when you come through some hard trials to come out on the other side you see that God actually had a blessing in store and that's just always wonderful if you stand with me let's just bow our heads in prayer before we go to the scripture this morning Heavenly Father Lord as we come before you lord as we stand behind the sacred desk Lord we approach it with all the reverence in our hearts that we have Lord asking God that you Lord Father would come and anoint us that we may be able to yield you to wear it be a help to the people would be uplifting to them dear God encouraging I pray we ask this Lord in your name and to give all the glory to you amen while you're standing you could terms me in your Bibles to mark chapter 2 mark chapter two and I want to begin reading in verse one and again he entered in to compare him after some days and it was noised that he was in the house and straightway many were gathered together and so much that there was no room to receive them no not so much as about the door and he preached the word unto them and they come unto Him bringing one sick of palsy which was borne of four and when they could not come nigh unto him for the press they uncovered the roof where he was and when they had broken it up they let down the bed wherein the sick of palsy lay when Jesus saw their faith he said unto the sick of palsy son thy sins be forgiven thee but there were certain of the scribes sitting there and reasoning in their hearts why does this man speak such blasphemy who can forgive sin but God only and immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves he said unto them why reason you these things in your hearts whether is it easier to say to the sick of palsy thy sins be forgiven thee or to say arise take up thy bed and walk but that you may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins he say it to the sick of palsy I say unto thee arise and take up thy bed and go thy way into thine house and immediately he rose and took up the bed and went forth before them all in so much that they all were amazed and glorified God saying we never saw it on this fashion you may be seated I want to just direct your attention back to the third verse and it says and they came unto Him bringing one sick of palsy which was borne of four and if I give this a title this morning I would say born of four I want to look at five words this morning first one has agreement there was four men that had to carry this one that was sick of palsy lay on his bed in order for these four men to be able to carry them they had to first come into agreement one with the other they had to come into agreement that they believed that there that they had a purpose in which to carry this man there they had to come into agreement that they were going to work together to do it and the Lord today if we agree here on earth the Bible says if we agree on earth as touching any one thing that whatever they ask it shall be done unto them of my father so it's important to agree you can't accomplish anything unless you have some agreement I've watched I see that you've got remodeling going on in your church we've had some work done on our church and still have some need of work and and you had to reach an agreement otherwise you'd never get anywhere and you wouldn't accomplish anything first thing you had to agree upon was that there was a need for it then you had to agree upon nervous if there was a reason for it that there was a ability to do it and it's with these four men there had to be a reason for them to carry will course he was sick of sick with palsy but they had to have faith that they weren't just carrying him there to carry him back home they had to have faith that once they got him there that Jesus was going to heal him that was their whole purpose of carrying him there was for Jesus to heal him I like how the Bible says and Jesus was in the house I believe he's in the house this morning a man where the Brenham said in the message of Elijah and the meal offerings said Heavenly Father humbly quietly reverently we come into the light great August before one thing happened you are here because you promised to be we know he's here because he promised to be here and he said before you're going away said whatsoever whatever that two or three gathered in my name there I'll be in there miss so we know it's his promise word and if they shall agree upon any single thing as touching one thing asked they shall receive it that's his word and he's obligated to stand behind his word and here these four had come into agreement that this man was going to receive his healing and so they picked him up to carrying their next word is assignment they had to who was going to who was going to be at what point there's four of them there were four points on the bed to be so who was going to be on one point or the other what if they decided well all four of them said no we want to be in the front we want to be first what if all four them said no I want you to go first I want out full up the rear I'll go last they had to come into an assignment brother Branham says I'm praying and fasting waiting on God I want to do my part while I'm here in California you do your part and get out and get the people in the song leader he's got an assignment to do and he comes and he does his part but if he's the only one saying then you're not doing your part it is in special songs is its leading and singing I remember one time brother feel some years ago was going to teach the group a new song and nobody sang with him and after the service one brother Clem Kenan said I really enjoyed that special brother my brother Phil said it wasn't meant to be a special but we've each got a part to do and I want you to know something there's not one part that's lesser than another you say well I'm not the preacher I'm not the song leader I'm not the musician but you know what you are the congregation what what good would we be to have musicians preachers and song leaders if there wasn't nobody to preach to nobody to help sing nobody to sing to the music what would it be so it's important you play an important part in bringing the presence of God into this house you've got an assignment you know we need to be prayed up when we come we need to come praying and expecting to hear from God not depending on the preacher to bring them to bring the service in his briefcase but we need to you know I'm not going to ask for hands but think of yourself when was the last time you prayed for a service before before you came when's the last time you prayed for the pastor or whoever was speaking before you came took some time not I know you've got time when you come here to set and break but I'm talking about before you get here I'm talking about during the week while the services you're waiting for the service to come up I'm talking about your daily prayers we've all got a part to do and we can't get out of place in the days of of Israel when David was King why the Levites had a part to play but David got out of his place one time got into the place of the Levite and took him on himself on how he was going to bring the ark back and David stepped out of his place and it cost a man his life and he might say well why wasn't David held accountable why was it that user was his life giving well God counted that he had made a choice himself to go along with what they were doing there was one nation that David should have consulted but David didn't consult Nathan the Prophet that was Nathan's assignment but instead David went to the captains and the hosts of thousands and consulted the people whether this would be a good idea to bring the ark down or not and brother branham said he thought he had a real revelation but that wasn't David's assignment David's assignment was to be king and we thought he had something you say what would the wood god reveal something to somebody in the congregation before the pastor he just might just to see what you're going to do with this the pastor he's human he's got to deal with his flesh just like you do he's got to deal with his human spirit just like you do he's got conscious memory reasoning imagination and and that he has to deal with he's got his own personal battles he has to fight his life just ain't all about pastoring he's got a personal walk but God if David would have waited then it would have come the one who was assigned to bring that revelation was Nathan and it would have came to pass it was God's will to bring the ark back and when they deserve that when they done it God's provided way and put it on the shoulders and Levites brother Graham said over the heart of the ministry and brought it back then the ark came back and there was worshiping and there was singing and there was dancing and much joy for lunch God's will for it to come back but it's important for us to stay in ours with our assignment pardon me next word I want to look at his assessment baba said they were gathered around so much within the house that then no one else could get in not even so much as by the door I was in Honduras one time the first time I ever went and I was in I went to a place Porte de cortes up in the north and they had a small church there and had they didn't have glass windows they just had wind their windows was a hole in the adobe wall and had wood shutters they can shut over him and they had all the shutters open and had the door open and had to and the light you know the lanterns and lights they had there why as far as the light would shine out the windows and doors you can see nothing but people the place was packed where there was not even standing room left so the people were standing outside so that they could hear I wonder if we would be that if we would be that way if this place got packed out and there wasn't no more standing room would we say well we're just going to stand where we can hear what's going on are we that hungry so they had to come to an assessment that they wasn't going to make it in by the door we have to come to assessment first to see if what we're doing is God's will see if it's the will of God if it's not the will of God then no matter how good it sounds it's no good so they couldn't get in by the door this assessment means to evaluate to estimate the nature quality ability of someone or something synonyms our evaluation or judgment you know we come to this place to take an assessment of ourselves this is the house of God's judgment this is where judgment begins and when we come in we ought to be saying what portion of this is being spoke is meant for me what is it being said for me to get something out of this what is God trying to tell me today not worried about what God is trying to tell brother so-and-so across the aisle or sister trolling slowly but concerned with what is God speaking to you and are a man's ought to not be throwing say a man has been for him but a man have meant for me I'm in agreement amen amen means so be it and we need to take account evaluation of ourselves and be honest about it and when we see that you know don't be looking for the shortcomings and somebody else looked we see where our own is and I can guarantee you that if that your shortcomings are going to be brought up across the pulpit because they're supposed to and the pastor doesn't always know what's going on in your individual lines he isn't there during the week to watch over everything you're saying or everything you're doing but there is somebody there's an all-seeing eye that's watching you all the time and so when you hear it come across the pulpit you know somebody's been watching but I also believe I also believe there's a scripture way that Paul told us about and that was when Chloe he said I've heard from the house of Chloe sometimes somebody would you know I believe in that too I hear something I don't just jump on it right away I wait till God says move on it sometimes people will see a situation or something going on in the church and they think well my goodness wanting something about this well you don't know is there is something being done and that is the first and most important thing that should be done and that's prayer we should pray about everything in our lives assessment they realize they wasn't going to get him in by the door so they had to come up with another way to get him in so they had in signing out how how are we going to get him in there and the Bible tells us they went up on the roof you say how did get up on the roof I'm glad you asked me that way their buildings were constructed then they had flat roofs buildings was constructed of mud and stone to make mud and straw and stone make bricks and they built up their houses and they had a flat roof and there was narrow stairway that went up the side of the house to the roof that's the way it was built and that brings us to the next word alignment these four men that bore this man sick and false you had to get in alignment one the other in order the deck how they were going to take him up that narrow staircase say how they do it I don't know but the Bible told us that they did it to somehow another they found out you know you say how what are we aligned with we align ourselves with the word let's see what the words got to say about it maybe they get there to save linking him in by the door were you sure we're supposed to come said yes I'm sure we supposed to come he's sick any where do you believe God is going to heal him well he said your holy said he's the Lord our God that healeth all of our diseases well what if what do we have disputes this morning we were able to get in by the door and by looking out there there's still room left on the pews so he's in the house then he's here to bring healing that's who he is that's one of his attributes friends look I'm looking forward to the time of the resurrection I'm looking forward to the time of the body change but I want you to know something you won't need divine healing then we need divine healing now now is the time that he is here to bring healing so he had to get an alignment one with another in order to decide how they were going to get him up that staircase also the house was made to where there was a hole in the roof it was it was small access for one person to come in and out at a time there was many of the people when Jesus came there were people that were worshiping the Sun the SU in but they didn't they wouldn't nobody up on the roof that day because the Esso end in the house and they got up on the roof and you say well why if they had that access hole why didn't they just let that man down through that hole they couldn't do it that way they had that bed had to be down there with him because the bed was going to have a purpose than it was going to serve and you know here the Bible tells us there was the scribes critics why did they come there in the first place why did they even come to deservers to criticize if there are so many people packed in there that no one else could get in then those scribes must have got there first sometimes you never think about it but let me tell you something that there's demons has show up for church sometimes they show up carried in in flesh where the devil's thereon ever hand and I'm like what is Satan saying then you drive back thousand demons there's ways they praise God you drive back thousand little that way because why the angels of God dwell in the praises of God's people where people are praising God there's angels of God there but brother branham said never getting there's three kinds of believers and here we found one of them they come there to criticize they come there to find fault and Jesus you think it have been enough when he told them what they were thinking the very thoughts of their heart but they were they were so set on finding fault that they they weren't there at all to to find whether it was true or not they already didn't believe it but there was a reason they had to be there that is because God wanted some witnesses that day among the unbelievers he wanted them to witness the power of God on earth and that's why testing him - he said my sins are forgiven the last word I want to look at his amazing grace amazing grace they begin to break up the roof in order to have it big enough to lower that bed down through there where the RAM said one day he was sitting in a house teaching the first thing you know stuff begin to fall around the floor I can't imagine him lookin sudden wonder who's climbing up there in a few minutes something else began to fall and they were taking the roof off the house they had some fella there they was going to bring him over to get him before the Lord and now this fella might not have had very much faith so they was going to let him down Jesus looking at the man know that he had sinned and done wrong but perceiving their faith whose faith the faith of the for he perceived the faith of the for they had faith he said maybe this man didn't have much faith but the far that got him there had faith that God was going to heal him and God look after Jesus look after faith and he recognized that faith now they weren't just saying they believe they took action upon it that's why they were tearing up the rough because they had faith if they can just hit this man before Jesus and then we're willing to do whatever it took to getting there so they were willing to start to tear up the roof maybe you know it could have been one concern said what were the owner of the house thing because I am worried about what the owner of the house thinks they can build a new roof we got to get this man down before Jesus this is the only way to get him in there so we got to do this so they before them begin to break that roof up and they broke up a hole big enough the Bible said that they lowered the bed down through the hole in the roof and lowered the bed down to the floor of the house right before Jesus now isn't that something that Jesus was just standing in the right location [Applause] he's always there he's always in the right location he's always on the right spot we just got to get to where he's at [Applause] and the Lord this bed down there and here was he scribes the ones that was going to question him and they would saw this man lowered down through the roof imagine them being there to criticize they said I look at this now we never seen none of this in our synagogues crazy people hallelujah and then jesus said that sins be forgiven thee but I'm said he knows that the man knowing the thoughts of his heart he said your sins are forgiven you and said get up and go on how to leave ask the thing that we need everywhere else today a revelation of the power of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ through the speaking of his word and it has life so here this man Laden jesus said thy sins be forgiven you imagine this man what his thoughts were he's still laying there on the bed but all of a sudden there's a freedom his sins have been forgiven what about the day that you found out he had forgiven all your sin [Music] [Applause] because maybe in your past there might have been some awful things things you wouldn't want known here this morning a man but they're all forgiven too and God put him in the sea of his forgetfulness that means God don't remember him no more brother Vance said if you done wrong and I knew about it he said I can forgive you but I couldn't forget it but God has the power to forget it say how can he do that it's because it goes back on the original owner of the sin who's going to give account for all that there's an old fella is going to give account for all that with the old man that was involved in doing that he's dead hallelujah on that day we won't stand in judgment to stand before the judgment seat why because we set in judgment here and let him change our lives [Applause] I've heard they say some people don't like change and I say well it depends on maybe what the change is but if you've once been bound and now you're free you can enjoy that change I don't know you there's been a change in me that old man is dead I'm not the man I used to be they said who is this man to forgive sins only God can forgive sin and Jesus said he perceived said why reason you in your hearts and he said is it easier to say thy sins be forgiven thee or take up thy bed and walk and then he said why that he said it that way jesus knew they were there to criticize he identified them the moment they walked through the door but he also identified everyone that was going to believe that walked through that door and so jesus said I said it that way that you may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sin I want you to know he's got power on earth to forgive sins and smartie I'm not the priest that you got to come and confess your sin to me you confess it to Almighty God but he's here this morning if there's anybody here that needs forgiveness he's here in the house this morning to give forgiveness amazing grace so then he said to the man said take up your bed arise and go forth and the Bible says immediately immediately the man who have been sick of palsy he didn't wait on his bed and say I wonder if this is true I wonder friends he had done been through it people had done tore up a roof on the house to get him down there before Jesus and notice this he got his mind so on Jesus he wouldn't pay no attention to them scribes they didn't discourage him when Jesus said I'll forgive your sin his faith soared he might have just had a little bit of faith when they let him down but when Jesus said law life sins are forgiven you he had great faith if he can forgive my sins he can heal me of any disease and so the Bible says he merely he rose and took up the bed and went forth before them all now I want you to know something the reason that he had to be lowered on the bed was so that in front of witnesses he could get off the bed and pick up the bed because he wouldn't he needed he was carried in by the bed but it was God's will for him to carry the bed out and he couldn't go back up by the roof but the people were so amazed can you imagine the people as he got up and began to walk toward him carrying his bed and then just making a path for it well hallelujah he might have been let down through the ceiling but he left by the door [Applause] Amazing Grace his sins were forgiven he was healed of his disease he was able to walk you imagine when he got outside and got reunited with the four that he carried him there hallelujah there they were up on the roof looking down and witness all this I imagine they got down off that roof as quick as they could so they could go meet him when he came out the door hallelujah I believe he's here don't you I believe that he can forgive sin I believe that he can heal us there may be some things that we have to go through there may be some sicknesses that we have to battle and the Lord of lettuce but he's there to heal what a reunion they had praise God I imagined the five of them just jumping up and down just praising God outside shaking one another's hands hugging one of those necks matching him telling them for thank you for carrying me here [Applause] brother branham said when he went on to see the other side said they were saying my precious brother my precious brother said there was one young lady that come up calling my precious brother and put her arms around his neck and the angel s and said do you know who that is he said no brother I said she was beautiful said you know that said you let her to the Lord when she was 90 years old it ain't going to be just the Prophet on that day it ain't going to be you some preachers but those of you that have went and testified about Jesus Christ just like Philip did to Nathanael come and see come and see that the Lord is God come and see that he's still alive I know there's many of you sitting here to say yeah I come because this one or that one witness to me years ago when I was just young boy I felt out my heart to go out and visit people around here and I went out and visited all I could why to give people to come hallelujah and on that day there's going to be a shout and fire they'll say because of you cause your faith thank you for that there's prayers you pray for people and I'll tell you what I've lived long enough in this life to know different ones who prayed for me that I've had opportunity to say thank you for praying for me I can remember a time my life and I was running from God and I tell people don't pray for me I didn't think I wanted to pray for me but they prayed for me anyhow and you know what that's why I'm here today you love the Lord this morning I know it's just a simple message is on my heart but I wanted to share it with you and I hope it's helped you Amen god bless you as a company a man [Music] and it becomes when he gets a hold of it becomes so applicable this is the result of a token life it brings it down to an application what a responsibility the Lord has charged every one of us with I'd say in my heart I speak for myself Lord I want to renew where I've been slacking I want to pick it up pick it up thankful to God for Amazing Grace but I think of how that the Lord let it right down through that message today all those other parts are so important that allows Amazing Grace to step in you know as many things in the scriptures where God admonishes us to do this to do this to do this to do that and then he steps in and he does what we cannot do and even in what he asked us to do it's him that equips us to have the faith to even do that and then it's all Amazing Grace but in every and everything when we look at it I thought about it just as the jury was speaking there and you know one of the things you can always tell when the Spirit of God is writing a service because not just to what you feel but it's how that the sod will take you right down through the word and there'll be things that start starting to connect and come together all the way across things you've been reading you've been hearing it all comes across and you'll find yourself here while what's being spoken but yet the Holy Spirit is doing just what he said he would do he said I'll bring every those things to your remembrance whatsoever I've said so you see sometimes that when you're listening to the word you're reading the word sometimes it seems like it don't seem like both semia I'm getting anything but remember before you have a fire you've got to get wood is that right in many times it's the mechanics of the word don't ever display that the mechanics are important because without mechanics dynamics cannot come and light it up even when Elijah when he was putting all those things in order it was all with a purpose that the fire was going to fall God knows exactly what he's doing think of the message and humble thyself a small little message but brother Brennan reiterates within that message in the first part of it then brother Vail speaks in the middle of it and brother Branham comes right back along and brother Graham comes right back to that place he said we all want to see that third Pole work among us he said but it will take every one of us in position so it's like a great watch every little thing timing together perfectly and the Lord knows that I tell you just I'm not trying to add anything to it it just is so wonderful how God has made known to us this morning not only our responsibility but his grace stepping in in our lives amen and I believe that I believe that I love that part where Lent where the lowering right down through the roof they didn't they didn't have to open up a roof and say oh he's over here let's go over here God knew how to direct a ride to the right spot I'll tell you friends over and over desert an overwhelming to recognize Lord you've got all things orchestrating it calls just to say Lord just help me to be more sensitive a new more sensitive amen hallelujah got a need this morning just printed before the Lord and let's just stand and we'll sing that song there is power in the name of Jesus to break every chain there is power in
