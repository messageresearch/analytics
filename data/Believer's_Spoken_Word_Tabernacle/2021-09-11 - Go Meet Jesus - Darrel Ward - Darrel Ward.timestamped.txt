[31:16] the lord this evening we're just
[31:18] expecting great things from the lord
[31:21] and we
[31:22] i want to read a prayer request here in
[31:24] just a moment and as i prepare to read
[31:26] that
[31:27] i'm
[31:28] glad that brother daryl
[31:30] ward was able to be here with us here on
[31:32] these this weekend
[31:34] and uh you know i've made it very clear
[31:36] to you here over the
[31:38] different
[31:39] different times of how that i we just so
[31:41] appreciate brother darrell's ministry i
[31:44] just appreciate the times that not only
[31:46] he's been here but also being able to
[31:49] work alongside him and just see how the
[31:51] lord has used brother daryl as he's
[31:54] yielded himself to the lord so many
[31:56] times and just to see just how god has
[31:58] used the gift and so we're just we're
[32:01] just with a great anticipation as our
[32:03] brother just
[32:04] yields himself to the lord tonight god
[32:06] knows what we have need of
[32:09] and let me just say what we just sang
[32:11] here in that part he's the name above
[32:13] every name
[32:14] it doesn't matter what new name they
[32:16] come out with he's above it
[32:18] it doesn't matter what situation arises
[32:21] he's above it
[32:23] i love what they said as it came forth
[32:25] in the book of acts in acts chapter 4
[32:28] when they received the refilling of the
[32:29] holy ghost their approach
[32:32] to what was happening in the church was
[32:33] they said thou art the almighty god
[32:38] who created heavens and earth they they
[32:41] took the situation and it was great
[32:43] but they put him and they recognized
[32:45] you're above this situation
[32:47] and tonight that's what faith does faith
[32:49] recognizes that god is above it not our
[32:52] feelings not what we think about it not
[32:54] even what someone else has said about it
[32:56] it's what god has said
[32:58] and god doesn't the one thing about it
[33:00] god don't have to update his word
[33:03] he just raises the standard
[33:05] and the raising of the standard is he
[33:06] makes it real by himself coming
[33:10] and making that word real
[33:13] in our midst
[33:14] and in our lives
[33:16] that's the real standard that gets
[33:18] raised
[33:19] so as we read this request here i've
[33:21] asked if brother juan would come as we
[33:23] get ready to bring brother daryl out and
[33:25] i've asked brother juan to sing this
[33:26] song tonight just had it on my heart
[33:29] and that is you do miracles so great
[33:32] and so i asked his brother juan we'll go
[33:34] in prayer and then brother juan will
[33:36] sing that and we'll bring brother
[33:37] darrell out so glad to have brother juan
[33:39] and sister rachel here with us sister
[33:41] angie god bless you it's good to have
[33:42] you here as well amen if anybody else
[33:45] i'm missing please forgive me
[33:48] this is from brother drake and he asked
[33:50] he asked that we would please pray for
[33:52] his stepfather david
[33:54] he survived a heart attack on monday
[33:57] but has been given only several days to
[33:59] live due to significant brain damage
[34:02] and just in that note right there
[34:05] when brother drake's mother called him
[34:08] on monday
[34:10] well she found him and he was blue
[34:14] and brother drake mentioned to her and
[34:15] he said well this is not it
[34:17] let's just look to the lord
[34:20] and in the ambulance they were able to
[34:23] revive him
[34:26] because there was nothing at that time
[34:29] and so as he's just been there in the in
[34:31] the place in the hospital hero since
[34:33] monday and just there
[34:35] just witnessing
[34:37] and just expressing of what
[34:39] of who the lord is and god is mindful
[34:43] we just want to
[34:44] knowing now that where his stepfather is
[34:46] at that he survived that heart attack
[34:49] god brought him through that
[34:51] and but they've only given him now
[34:53] several days to live because of the
[34:55] significant brain damage
[34:58] and he said we're grateful for god's
[35:00] miracle of survival and we pray for his
[35:02] will and the healing power moving
[35:05] forward
[35:06] and so we know as believers
[35:09] you know
[35:10] there's a lot of things and you hear
[35:11] where brother branham would make these
[35:13] statements and we've not just seen where
[35:14] brother bran has made statements we've
[35:16] witnessed it ourselves
[35:18] brother dave you've witnessed it where
[35:21] sister shirley had moved on but god
[35:23] brought her right back
[35:24] that was just that was just what a year
[35:26] and a half ago
[35:28] right there
[35:29] it just as god just moved so there's no
[35:32] situation
[35:33] that's beyond the lord
[35:36] sometimes the situation as i said it can
[35:38] hit us and seems like it just knocks the
[35:40] air out of us and we think oh my
[35:42] goodness because we can go down and know
[35:44] oh this person had this oh there was
[35:46] only a week oh this person had this and
[35:48] this
[35:49] we're either going to look at that
[35:51] report or we'll look at the true report
[35:55] we
[35:56] have believed the true report
[36:00] now healing however that healing comes
[36:02] and and everything it that's in god's
[36:04] hands
[36:05] because there's never ever
[36:08] never ever a defeat in the economy of
[36:11] god sometimes healing doesn't come the
[36:13] way that we're expecting it to come
[36:17] but it comes
[36:19] and so we want to we want to pray
[36:21] according to the word of god and just
[36:22] ask that god will just move for this
[36:24] need and i'm sure that there's no doubt
[36:26] many other needs
[36:27] and there's needs that even that maybe
[36:29] we're not even aware of here tonight as
[36:31] a congregation but other needs that i'm
[36:33] aware of that thank god these people are
[36:35] no longer in a hospital they're back
[36:37] home
[36:38] and so we just thank god for his mercy
[36:40] so let's as we just go to the lord in
[36:42] prayer and just ask that god would just
[36:44] undertake
[36:46] on on the behalf of brother drake's
[36:48] stepfather could we do that
[36:50] amen heavenly father
[36:53] lord
[36:54] we take this need lord before your
[36:56] throne

[44:53] then when jesus came
[44:56] he found that he had lain in the grave
[44:59] four days already
[45:01] now bethany was nigh unto jerusalem
[45:04] about 15 followings off
[45:07] and many of the jews came to martha and
[45:09] married to comfort them
[45:11] concerning their brother
[45:14] then martha as soon as she heard that
[45:16] jesus was coming
[45:18] she went out and met him
[45:20] but mary
[45:22] set still
[45:24] in the house
[45:26] then said martha unto jesus lord
[45:30] if thou has been here my brother had not
[45:32] died
[45:34] but i know
[45:36] that even now
[45:38] whatsoever thou will ask of god
[45:40] god will give it thee
[45:44] jesus said unto her thy brother shall
[45:47] rise again
[45:49] and martha said unto him i know that he
[45:52] shall rise again in the resurrection at
[45:55] the last day
[45:57] jesus said unto her
[45:59] i am the resurrection and the life
[46:02] he that believeth in me though he were
[46:04] dead yet shall he live and whosoever
[46:08] liveth and believeth in me
[46:10] shall never die
[46:13] believe us thou this
[46:16] amen
[46:18] let us bow our heads
[46:19] i want to speak to you for a few minutes
[46:21] this evening on a just a little simple
[46:23] thought the lord gave us on go meet
[46:26] jesus
[46:30] heavenly father
[46:34] truly lord
[46:36] there is thanksgiving in our hearts this
[46:38] evening
[46:41] lord as we
[46:43] lifted our hearts and our hands to you
[46:45] and worshiped lord
[46:47] testifying that there is no god like you
[46:53] lord you do miracles so great
[46:57] and god what a privilege it is lord to
[47:00] serve the living god
[47:03] when man will take stone or metal or
[47:07] wood fascinating out of god and he'll
[47:10] bow before a god that he made with his
[47:12] hands and worship some dead image
[47:16] but oh god tonight i'm so grateful
[47:19] that i don't serve a god that i made
[47:22] with my hands but i serve a god who made
[47:25] me with his hands
[47:27] and lord i pray tonight god that thou
[47:30] who spoke to the wind and it obeyed your
[47:33] voice may you speak to every heart
[47:36] that's in this building this evening
[47:39] and lord no matter what the need would
[47:41] be lord no matter what the doctor's
[47:43] report would be or whatever situation
[47:46] they would find their self in it's not
[47:48] greater than you lord
[47:50] so we look to you the author and
[47:52] finisher of our faith and lord may it
[47:55] rise up tonight and receive that which
[47:57] you've already done for us
[48:00] lord bless brother samuel lord his
[48:02] ministry his family the local church
[48:05] here dear god may signs and wonders be
[48:07] wrought at the hands of the believers
[48:10] dear god that this community would know
[48:12] that thou art the same yesterday today
[48:14] and forever
[48:16] receive honor and glory unto thyself for
[48:18] we ask these things in jesus name and
[48:21] the bride says
[48:23] god bless you saints you may be seated i
[48:25] want to call your attention back to
[48:26] verse 20.
[48:28] where it said then martha as soon as she
[48:30] heard that jesus was coming she went out
[48:33] and met him
[48:34] but mary sat still
[48:37] in the house
[48:39] you see brother sister i believe
[48:42] that these two sisters that we read
[48:44] about in our scripture this afternoon
[48:47] i believe that they represent everyone
[48:50] that is in this building tonight
[48:53] for the way i see it we can do one or
[48:55] two things
[48:56] we can do like martha when she heard
[48:58] that jesus was come she got up and went
[49:01] to meet him
[49:03] or we can be like mary
[49:05] and set still in the house
[49:08] because you see you're going to do one
[49:09] or the other
[49:11] the prophet of god said when you come to
[49:12] the house of god you never leave the
[49:14] same way you'll either be better or
[49:16] worse off
[49:18] and any time the word of god is
[49:20] presented to us it causes us to declare
[49:23] or to make a statement whether believe
[49:25] it or whether we don't
[49:28] amen and so i say as these two sisters
[49:30] that we read about we're going to do one
[49:33] or the other in this building tonight
[49:35] for jesus said where two or three are
[49:37] gathered in my name i will be in their
[49:40] midst you know many people come to
[49:42] church for many different reasons but i
[49:45] want you to know that when he comes when
[49:47] he comes he comes in the power of his
[49:50] resurrection he sends healing in the
[49:52] form of his word he comes to pour out
[49:55] the holy ghost he comes to fulfill every
[49:58] promise that he's made to the believer
[50:01] when he comes he comes to bring
[50:03] deliverance he comes to bring healing he
[50:05] comes to bring forgiveness he comes to
[50:07] bring joy unspeakable and full of glory
[50:11] when jesus comes the temptus power is
[50:14] broken
[50:16] and when he comes we can either get up
[50:19] and go meet him
[50:21] or we can sit still
[50:23] in the house
[50:25] but i say to you let's not sit still
[50:28] his here his word says he's here let's
[50:31] get up and step out and possess what
[50:34] belongs to us
[50:35] this is our day this is our hour this is
[50:38] for our time to shine in the slight of
[50:41] his word amen luther had their day
[50:43] wesley had their day pentecost had their
[50:46] day but this is our day now amen
[50:50] hallelujah the promises of god's word
[50:52] they are for the believer thank you lord
[50:55] to us and i say let the devil rob us so
[50:58] none of it amen
[51:00] hallelujah
[51:01] the promises of god's word for the
[51:03] believer they belong to us
[51:05] they are by our possession brother
[51:07] brennan said when christ died at calvary
[51:09] every redemptive blessing was placed
[51:11] into the hand of the believer
[51:14] like the sister in the communist country
[51:16] i i know you've heard the story
[51:18] they they wasn't allowed to have church
[51:20] and so the the baker there in this
[51:22] little village he was a believer also
[51:25] and he would bake a certain kind of
[51:27] bread
[51:28] and so the believers would go to the
[51:30] baker and ask for this bread
[51:32] and inside the bread was a message
[51:35] saying where the service would be held
[51:37] that night
[51:39] and so by the breaking of the bread came
[51:41] the revelation of where jesus would be
[51:47] hallelujah so she gets the message and
[51:51] on the way to church that night in a
[51:53] secret meeting
[51:54] she runs into a soldier
[51:57] and you know they had a curfew you
[51:58] couldn't be out a certain time and he
[51:59] said hey where you going
[52:02] she said my brother died and i'm going
[52:04] for the reading of the will
[52:06] and she goes to church
[52:09] and they sang songs of zion and somebody
[52:12] got happy and started shouting
[52:14] somebody got healed and somebody got
[52:17] saved and somebody got filled with the
[52:19] holy ghost and they had foot washing and
[52:21] they had communion and oh my just i like
[52:24] to be in church services like that
[52:26] and on the way home she was so happy she
[52:29] was singing joyous mind healing his mind
[52:32] the holy ghost is mine all mine and she
[52:36] ran into the same
[52:38] soldier
[52:40] and he said what did your brother leave
[52:42] you
[52:46] she said oh
[52:48] he left me everything
[52:52] oh hallelujah every redemptive blessing
[52:55] belongs to us amen
[52:58] i say let's get up and go meet jesus you
[53:01] see the answer to every problem is jesus
[53:05] he is the answer you say i'm sick well
[53:09] get up and go meet him
[53:11] i'm discouraged brother daryl get up and
[53:13] go meet him i'm having a hard time then
[53:16] get up and go meet him
[53:18] everything you have need of jesus christ
[53:22] is the answer amen
[53:24] you see how mary knew was that death had
[53:27] come
[53:28] to their house
[53:30] sorrow and fear had all come to their
[53:33] house
[53:34] but martha called a revelation
[53:37] that caused her to get up
[53:40] and go meet him you see death had struck
[53:43] the home of mary and martha and no doubt
[53:45] they thought how could this happen to us
[53:49] jesus is our friend
[53:51] he's slept in our spare room he's he's
[53:54] set at our table
[53:56] we're message believers
[53:59] we've left everything to follow him
[54:03] how could the sorrow come to us how
[54:06] could the doctor's report be so bad
[54:09] we're his people
[54:10] we should never have trials we should
[54:12] never have troubles every day should be
[54:15] blue skies and smooth sailing every day
[54:18] should just be a picnic
[54:21] i like a nice picnic
[54:25] those are real nice thoughts but you see
[54:27] the problem of it is
[54:29] jesus never promised that
[54:34] he never said we wouldn't
[54:36] cry he never said we wouldn't get sick
[54:40] he never said we wouldn't have sorrow he
[54:42] never said we wouldn't suffer he never
[54:45] promised smooth sailing he never said
[54:48] there wouldn't be storms
[54:51] but he did say
[54:53] i will never leave you nor will i
[54:56] forsake you
[54:58] then no matter what happens in our life
[55:00] we do not face it alone amen
[55:04] you see sometimes god allows things to
[55:07] come into our lives so that he can come
[55:09] to us and show us just how great
[55:13] he is
[55:16] you may have a great cancer you may have
[55:17] a great trial you may have a great
[55:19] problem
[55:20] i'm not i'm not i'm not doubting that
[55:22] i'm not belittling that
[55:24] but i'm just here to tell you tonight
[55:26] how god's greater
[55:28] [Applause]
[55:29] amen
[55:31] look i'm not taking light of our
[55:33] suffering
[55:34] we have real tears
[55:37] we have real
[55:39] pain
[55:40] anybody's ever had back trouble and that
[55:42] nerve pain going down your leg that's
[55:44] real
[55:46] pain
[55:48] somebody told me the other day said you
[55:49] know this coveted stuff i think it's
[55:51] fake i said buddy
[55:53] it is not faith
[55:56] stuff about killed me
[55:59] real pain
[56:00] real sickness real sorrow amen
[56:04] real tears it hurts to lose loved ones
[56:10] i know what it is to have pain when you
[56:12] stand in a pull up to a gas station and
[56:15] have to pray to get out of the car
[56:16] because the pain is so bad to get gas to
[56:19] get home
[56:21] real tears real pain real sorrow real
[56:24] fear
[56:25] but a real god amen who's bigger than
[56:28] all of it
[56:30] he's bigger than all of our problems
[56:32] he's bigger than all of our trucks my
[56:34] god is bigger amen than anything i will
[56:36] ever face in my life
[56:40] mary and martha in this great time of
[56:42] sorrow in this in this great time of
[56:44] need it was their darkest hour
[56:48] you see they were just left alone mary
[56:50] and martha their their mother was gone
[56:51] their father was gone and now you know
[56:53] the lazarus he was he was supposed to
[56:55] take care of him he was going to be the
[56:57] breadwinner he was going to be the
[56:59] security to take care of the sisters
[57:02] they was going to lean on him he he was
[57:04] going to provide the money for the rent
[57:08] and now he was gone
[57:11] the rug if you see as we say was jerked
[57:14] out from under them
[57:16] those two girls just left alone in the
[57:19] world
[57:20] and there they sat in sackcloth and
[57:23] black veils and weeping and mourning
[57:25] over the loss of their brother
[57:27] and no doubt
[57:28] the loss of their security
[57:31] crying some even over their own self
[57:33] for the situation they found themselves
[57:35] in it was their
[57:37] darkest hour
[57:39] but i'm so glad that we can read in the
[57:41] word and find out that in their darkest
[57:44] hour that's when he showed up
[57:47] the prophet said that's just the way he
[57:49] does it hey brother sister this may be
[57:51] your darkest hour this evening right now
[57:53] may be your darkest day that you've ever
[57:55] been in but i want you to know that
[57:57] jesus comes along just at the darkest
[58:00] hour it was the darkest hour of the
[58:02] woman with the blood as she would ever
[58:03] see 12 years of bleeding and the
[58:06] bleeding would not stop
[58:08] and how it got on her nerves and the
[58:09] prophet of god said she spent everything
[58:12] and the doctor said she would never be
[58:14] better it would never stop the bleeding
[58:16] on my what a time in her darkest hour
[58:21] then jesus came along it was the darkest
[58:23] hour jairus had ever saw his only
[58:25] daughter lay dead it was his darkest
[58:28] hour that's when jesus come along
[58:32] amen
[58:33] it was the darkest hour peter and the
[58:35] disposals of the disciples that ever saw
[58:37] out there on the sea that night when ten
[58:39] thousand demons swear they would drown
[58:42] them
[58:42] it was third darkest hour
[58:45] that jesus
[58:47] came walking on the water
[58:50] it was in that dark hour
[58:53] that martha got the word
[58:55] that jesus had come
[58:57] you see martha realized the answer to
[59:00] her sorrow the answer to her darkness
[59:02] the answer to her fear
[59:04] was jesus
[59:06] she realized that god had a way provided
[59:09] and jesus was the answer
[59:12] for everything she was going through
[59:15] he was the answer then he's the answer
[59:17] now and if there's a tomorrow he will be
[59:20] the answer tomorrow
[59:23] and when she got word that he had come
[59:26] she got up
[59:28] and she went and met him
[59:30] because she knew he was the answer
[59:35] she went to meet the answer
[59:38] to her problem
[59:39] it reminds me of blind bartimaeus
[59:42] sitting there on the rocks of the of the
[59:44] walls of jericho
[59:46] and he wore a beggar's robe that
[59:48] identified him as a blind beggar
[59:52] and sitting there in the sun trying to
[59:54] get a few pennies
[59:57] he got to thinking about his life
[1:00:01] you know sometimes we get so busy living
[1:00:04] we forgot we forget what it is that
[1:00:06] we're living for
[1:00:08] i think it's good sometimes for us to
[1:00:10] slow down and stop a minute and remember
[1:00:14] where we come from
[1:00:16] remember the great things that god has
[1:00:19] done
[1:00:20] for us
[1:00:20] [Music]
[1:00:22] amen and standing there in the sun
[1:00:25] he got to thinking about his life
[1:00:29] he thought you know i
[1:00:31] i remember i had some dubs that
[1:00:34] that they would do tricks and
[1:00:36] i would get money
[1:00:39] what happened
[1:00:40] to those doves
[1:00:44] i remember
[1:00:47] my little girl got sick
[1:00:51] and i went behind the house and i i
[1:00:53] lifted my eyes to jehovah
[1:00:57] i remember praying i
[1:00:59] said father
[1:01:02] my little girl's sick
[1:01:06] don't take her from me
[1:01:09] i need her
[1:01:12] i see the world through her eyes
[1:01:16] i smell the fragrance of the flower and
[1:01:19] she tells me what it looks like
[1:01:22] and i hear the singing of the bird
[1:01:24] and she tells me what the bird looks
[1:01:27] like
[1:01:29] and we said and she looks into the sky
[1:01:32] sees the different characters that's in
[1:01:34] the
[1:01:36] clouds i need her father
[1:01:40] i see the world through her eyes
[1:01:44] don't take her from me
[1:01:47] if you let her live
[1:01:50] i'll give you my doves
[1:01:53] and she got better and he kept his
[1:01:56] promise to god
[1:01:59] oh may god help us to keep every promise
[1:02:02] that we make to god
[1:02:06] and it wasn't long after that
[1:02:09] i said i remember
[1:02:11] my wife got sick
[1:02:13] perhaps it was a pandemic
[1:02:16] perhaps he got
[1:02:17] what his little girl had
[1:02:20] and he went out behind the building
[1:02:21] again
[1:02:23] he said father
[1:02:25] my wife is sick
[1:02:29] don't take her from me lord
[1:02:32] i need her
[1:02:35] she cooks for me
[1:02:38] she keeps my clothes clean
[1:02:42] she puts my cup right where i can find
[1:02:44] it every time at the same place she puts
[1:02:47] my fork right beside the plate the same
[1:02:50] place every time so i can find it
[1:02:54] she's so good to me lord
[1:02:56] i can't make it without her
[1:02:59] don't take her from me i trust you
[1:03:02] brothers feel that way about your wife
[1:03:05] as i feel that way about mine
[1:03:10] i said lord if you let her live
[1:03:14] i'll give you my lamb
[1:03:18] and she got well
[1:03:19] and he goes down to the temple
[1:03:22] to keep his promise to god
[1:03:26] and he runs into the priest and he says
[1:03:28] you know the story we're ghost now
[1:03:30] bartimaeus
[1:03:31] said i'm going down to the temple to
[1:03:33] sacrifice my lamb to jehovah said you
[1:03:36] can't do that you need that lamb to help
[1:03:38] you get around sit here take this money
[1:03:40] go buy you a lamb he said i never
[1:03:43] promised god a lamb i promised god this
[1:03:46] lamb and if i give god this lamb he will
[1:03:50] provide a lamb for my eyes
[1:03:56] and thinking on those ways as he was
[1:03:58] sitting there he thought what made me
[1:04:00] say that
[1:04:02] a provided lamb that god would provide a
[1:04:05] lamb oh i'm so grateful for inspiration
[1:04:08] that sometimes the spirit of god will
[1:04:09] move on you and you'll say things you
[1:04:11] don't even realize what you're saying
[1:04:13] but move by the spirit of god he said
[1:04:16] what made me say that a provided lamb
[1:04:19] that god will provide himself a lamb and
[1:04:22] sitting there thinking about these
[1:04:23] things
[1:04:25] his thoughts became manifested
[1:04:29] and he began to hear a noise and he said
[1:04:32] would someone please tell me what's
[1:04:34] going on and someone said it's jesus of
[1:04:36] nazareth the lamb of god he's come and
[1:04:39] when blind bartimaeus heard that the
[1:04:41] lamb
[1:04:43] the lamb he began to cry out jesus thou
[1:04:46] son of david have mercy on me
[1:04:49] someone said hey hold your peace
[1:04:53] well take none of that screaming and
[1:04:55] carrying on around here yeah
[1:04:57] you get happy you raised one finger for
[1:04:59] a man and two for hallelujah
[1:05:04] you need to calm down a little bit
[1:05:05] you're a little pentecostal
[1:05:09] but the bible said he cried the louder
[1:05:12] jesus thou son of david have mercy on me
[1:05:16] and the bible said jesus stood still
[1:05:21] what stopped jesus it wasn't his voice
[1:05:24] he was 150 yards from him and everybody
[1:05:27] screaming and shouting he would have
[1:05:29] never audibly heard his voice then what
[1:05:31] stopped jesus if it wasn't his voice
[1:05:34] i'll tell you what it was it was his
[1:05:36] faith
[1:05:38] and i say to you if his face stopped
[1:05:40] jesus your faith can stop him tonight
[1:05:43] [Applause]
[1:05:46] jesus
[1:05:48] stood still and they said he stopped
[1:05:52] and he's calling
[1:05:53] for you hallelujah
[1:05:56] now blind bartimaeus is left with this
[1:05:58] decision that every one of us is left
[1:06:01] with in this building this evening
[1:06:04] he was left with this decision either
[1:06:07] get up off the rock
[1:06:09] and go meet jesus
[1:06:11] right we're set still
[1:06:16] you see the master was calling
[1:06:18] it required for him to make a decision
[1:06:22] either get up and go meet him
[1:06:25] or sit still
[1:06:27] on the rock
[1:06:29] and the bible said in verse 50 that he
[1:06:31] casting away his garment rose and came
[1:06:35] to jesus
[1:06:36] he got up and went and met jesus casting
[1:06:40] away that old blind beggar's robe
[1:06:44] but notice when did he cast it away not
[1:06:46] after jesus prayed for him before he
[1:06:49] ever got to jesus he was already
[1:06:51] identified himself i don't need a blind
[1:06:54] beggar's robe i've got a lamb provided
[1:06:56] amen
[1:06:58] whoa he cast off the road before he ever
[1:07:01] got to jesus
[1:07:03] he was as blind as blind could be but he
[1:07:06] saw more than 99 of the people standing
[1:07:09] there
[1:07:10] he saw a lamb provided and i say to you
[1:07:13] my brother my sister can you rise up
[1:07:15] tonight and step towards the promised
[1:07:17] word for your day
[1:07:20] cast off fear cast off asthma cast off
[1:07:23] high blood pressure cast off back
[1:07:26] trouble i don't need an arthritis robe i
[1:07:29] don't need a back trouble
[1:07:33] i don't need a glaucoma robe i've got a
[1:07:35] lamb provided amen
[1:07:39] oh glory to god god's provided way for
[1:07:43] us
[1:07:44] the prophet said that was god's provided
[1:07:46] way
[1:07:47] was to go meet jesus
[1:07:49] that's right
[1:07:50] got sorrow in your home
[1:07:52] go meet jesus
[1:07:54] got sickness in your home go meet jesus
[1:07:57] got heart aches in your home go meet
[1:07:59] jesus hallelujah if you have got a need
[1:08:03] for any thing
[1:08:06] go
[1:08:07] meet
[1:08:08] jesus
[1:08:10] go meet him
[1:08:11] he's got all the remedy and everything
[1:08:13] and then he says this he ain't got the
[1:08:15] remedy
[1:08:17] he's got the cure
[1:08:22] you got need for anything
[1:08:24] get up and go
[1:08:26] meet
[1:08:27] jesus
[1:08:30] then if god provided a way for us to go
[1:08:32] meet jesus there has to be a way to do
[1:08:35] that
[1:08:37] if god anointed his prophet
[1:08:40] to speak this quote god's way provided
[1:08:42] for us september 1952
[1:08:47] if god anointed his prophet to speak
[1:08:50] this quote to us
[1:08:53] then there has to be a way for us to do
[1:08:54] that or god would be unjust
[1:08:57] for he told us to do something
[1:08:59] that we couldn't do
[1:09:03] so then if he said for us to go meet
[1:09:06] jesus you've got a need for anything
[1:09:10] go
[1:09:11] meet jesus
[1:09:13] then there has to be a way for us to do
[1:09:15] that or god would be unjust in telling
[1:09:17] us to do it and not make a way provided
[1:09:20] for us to fulfill it
[1:09:22] so there has to be a way for us to do it
[1:09:24] in the day that we're living in
[1:09:28] are you still with me
[1:09:30] you see in order to meet him you've got
[1:09:32] to know where he's at
[1:09:35] i know that's simple but that's just
[1:09:37] hillbilly education right there
[1:09:39] if i told you meet me tomorrow i'll buy
[1:09:42] you the biggest steak in ohio
[1:09:45] what's the next thing you're going to
[1:09:46] say exactly right
[1:09:50] where at what time
[1:09:56] amen
[1:09:57] amen
[1:09:59] he said
[1:10:01] that's good
[1:10:02] he said a little while the world will
[1:10:04] see me no more
[1:10:07] but she shall see me
[1:10:11] how
[1:10:12] how
[1:10:13] will i see you lord all right
[1:10:16] you see if there's a biblical question
[1:10:18] there must be a biblical answer
[1:10:22] jesus said the world will see me no more
[1:10:24] but ye shall see me
[1:10:29] how lord
[1:10:30] how will i see you
[1:10:33] how can i in the day that i'm living in
[1:10:36] how can i see you
[1:10:37] he answers the question
[1:10:40] little while the world will see me no
[1:10:41] more but ye shall see me for i'll be
[1:10:44] with you
[1:10:46] even
[1:10:48] in you
[1:10:50] you know god open our eyes this evening
[1:10:53] and let us see lord it's not so we
[1:10:55] someday some happy day i say not sunday
[1:10:59] i say today
[1:11:02] it's not something that's going to be
[1:11:04] it's something that's here now
[1:11:09] we want to see jesus
[1:11:11] we want to see jesus but you can only
[1:11:13] see him in the manifestation of his word
[1:11:16] that's promised in the hour that you're
[1:11:18] living in you see luther saw him in his
[1:11:20] day wesley saw him in their day but
[1:11:22] you've got to see him in your day
[1:11:26] if the door back air opened and somebody
[1:11:28] came up here dragging across and
[1:11:30] bleeding everywhere and a crown of
[1:11:32] thorns people would scream and faint and
[1:11:34] everything else but that would not be
[1:11:36] jesus
[1:11:40] because he's already done that
[1:11:45] people would get so excited oh there's
[1:11:47] jesus he's bleeding
[1:11:51] that wouldn't be him
[1:11:53] he's already
[1:11:55] fulfilled that
[1:11:57] so the only way you can see him is see
[1:11:59] him in the word that's promised for the
[1:12:01] hour that you're living in
[1:12:06] jesus said i'm the vine and you're the
[1:12:08] bridge
[1:12:10] the vine does not bear the fruit but the
[1:12:13] the the the branch bears the fruit it's
[1:12:15] the evidence of the life that's in the
[1:12:17] vine
[1:12:20] the prophet of god said it this way that
[1:12:22] the only lips god has is your lips the
[1:12:24] only eyes god has in your eyes the only
[1:12:27] hands he has is your hands
[1:12:30] i'm the vine and you're the breast and
[1:12:32] what kind of fruit would it bear if the
[1:12:34] life that was in him is in his church
[1:12:36] he'll bear the same kind of life that he
[1:12:38] bore when he was here
[1:12:42] making him the same yesterday today and
[1:12:45] forever
[1:12:47] he's here in the person of the holy
[1:12:48] spirit i'm the vine you're the branch
[1:12:50] the vine does not bear the fruit
[1:12:54] the vine cannot bear the fruit it's the
[1:12:56] branches that bears the fruit
[1:12:58] and it's energized from the life of the
[1:13:00] vine and your lips is his lips when
[1:13:02] you're energized and your hands is his
[1:13:05] hands when you're energized by the life
[1:13:08] of the vine
[1:13:11] i was in nicaragua just a few years ago
[1:13:13] it's about 600 in that meeting
[1:13:16] about halfway back on the end was a
[1:13:18] sister and was going to have a prayer
[1:13:19] line that night but it was just too many
[1:13:21] people we'd been there all night so i
[1:13:23] said we'll just have one mass prayer for
[1:13:25] everybody and i said lay hands on one
[1:13:27] another and we'll pray
[1:13:30] and just as i started to pray a voice
[1:13:32] spoke to my heart and said i looked back
[1:13:34] and i saw the sisters she had her hand
[1:13:36] up and a voice spoke and said go lay
[1:13:38] your hands on her
[1:13:41] and i jumped off the platform and i went
[1:13:43] back
[1:13:44] and i put my hand in her hand
[1:13:46] and we begin to pray
[1:13:48] and when the service was over she said
[1:13:51] brother there can i speak to you i don't
[1:13:52] speak spanish just to an interpreter i
[1:13:54] said yes ma'am she said tonight
[1:13:57] when you told the people to lay hands on
[1:13:59] one another she said nobody laid hands
[1:14:01] on me
[1:14:04] and she said i thought why does nobody
[1:14:07] care for me
[1:14:10] why would nobody lay hand on me she said
[1:14:12] i just wanted somebody to care
[1:14:16] i just wanted somebody to lay their hand
[1:14:19] on me
[1:14:20] and she said i said lord
[1:14:23] why won't nobody lay their hand on me
[1:14:26] and she said when i said that she said a
[1:14:28] voice spoke to me and said i'll lay my
[1:14:31] hand on you
[1:14:32] he said brother darling it no sooner
[1:14:34] spoke hallelujah then you put your hand
[1:14:37] in my hand
[1:14:39] no am i jesus of course not
[1:14:43] but he used my hands
[1:14:47] just like he wants to use your hands
[1:14:49] your eyes your lips to pray for your
[1:14:52] brother yours is come out somebody we
[1:14:54] are a body we need one another
[1:14:57] [Applause]
[1:15:00] amen you see his ministry is in his
[1:15:03] bride which is his body we are his body
[1:15:06] on the earth
[1:15:09] question answers on the seal the bride
[1:15:11] will be the flesh and bones of christ
[1:15:15] bone of his bone flesh of his flesh
[1:15:18] spirit of his spirit
[1:15:21] then where is he
[1:15:23] he's right here with us
[1:15:25] now
[1:15:27] you know we've been wearing the mask
[1:15:29] have to wear the mask you know go in
[1:15:31] places
[1:15:33] i stopped the other day traveling
[1:15:34] somewhere and i stopped to get some
[1:15:35] chips and a drink get some gas so i'm
[1:15:38] standing there in the line
[1:15:40] and this this man walked in he must have
[1:15:42] been a local
[1:15:43] because he come walking in the store and
[1:15:45] the lady behind the cash register
[1:15:48] she said why john
[1:15:50] you've changed your mask
[1:15:54] and when she said that i about shouted
[1:15:57] past potato chips
[1:16:00] because it struck me
[1:16:02] it struck me you see all that god has
[1:16:04] done he simply just changed his mask
[1:16:10] oh hallelujah the same god that was in
[1:16:12] the body called jesus is now in the body
[1:16:16] called the bride
[1:16:18] doing the same thing he did when he was
[1:16:21] here making himself the same yesterday
[1:16:23] today and forever
[1:16:27] hallelujah
[1:16:30] verily verily i say unto you the works i
[1:16:32] do shall you do also and greater
[1:16:36] we can't do nothing greater than raise
[1:16:38] the dead and open blinded eyes
[1:16:41] but that greater means more
[1:16:43] because you see in his day it was one
[1:16:45] body signs and wonders following that
[1:16:48] body now today in his bride it's a midi
[1:16:51] membered body around the world
[1:16:55] signs and wonders following
[1:16:57] the believer
[1:17:00] jesus said unto her thy brother shall
[1:17:02] rise again
[1:17:03] and martha said unto him i know he shall
[1:17:05] rise again in the resurrection at the
[1:17:07] last day
[1:17:08] and jesus said unto her i am the
[1:17:11] resurrection and the life
[1:17:14] he that believeth in me though we were
[1:17:15] dead yet shall live and whosoever liveth
[1:17:17] and believeth me shall never die martha
[1:17:19] do you believe this
[1:17:21] praise the lord and she said unto him
[1:17:24] yea lord
[1:17:26] i believe that thou art the christ the
[1:17:29] son of god which should come into the
[1:17:31] world
[1:17:32] and the bible said when she had so said
[1:17:35] she went her way and called mary her
[1:17:38] sister
[1:17:40] secretly
[1:17:44] i never noticed that before
[1:17:46] but when i started it just kind of
[1:17:48] jumped out at me she didn't go busting
[1:17:50] it hey
[1:17:53] but it was a secret message
[1:17:56] to the blood king
[1:18:02] it wasn't to everybody but it was to the
[1:18:04] blood kitten
[1:18:08] oh god
[1:18:10] anybody done their dna
[1:18:13] ancestry caught 23 of me anybody done it
[1:18:15] no y'all other i did it too yeah i did
[1:18:18] it too sis
[1:18:20] man was i ever surprised i could go
[1:18:22] anywhere in the world be at home
[1:18:26] [Applause]
[1:18:32] i could never be a racist it's
[1:18:33] impossible
[1:18:40] but when i was studying the dna do you
[1:18:41] know you get 50 of your dna from your
[1:18:43] mama
[1:18:45] and you get 50 of dna from your daddy
[1:18:47] did you know that
[1:18:48] and that's why some people say you look
[1:18:50] just like your mama
[1:18:51] another say no he looks just like his
[1:18:53] daddy
[1:18:54] and the wife always says the older you
[1:18:56] get the more like your daddy
[1:19:00] it's the dna
[1:19:02] it's the genes that was passed down from
[1:19:04] your father so you get so much from your
[1:19:07] daddy and so much from your mother
[1:19:10] naturally speaking
[1:19:11] well the natural types of spiritual
[1:19:13] and i got to look and you know what i
[1:19:15] found the prophet of god said god is our
[1:19:18] father
[1:19:19] then 50 of my spiritual dna come from my
[1:19:23] daddy
[1:19:24] and then i found a quote where brother
[1:19:25] breton said we was we was nurse from the
[1:19:28] breast of el shadia he said so you see
[1:19:30] god is your mother
[1:19:36] so i get fifty percent of spiritual dna
[1:19:38] from my daddy and fifty spin oh god then
[1:19:42] what does that make the bride she's all
[1:19:44] god manifested in the flesh amen
[1:19:49] hallelujah
[1:19:50] [Applause]
[1:19:52] hallelujah she went to mary secretly
[1:19:57] and said mary the master has come and he
[1:20:00] calls for thee and the bible says in
[1:20:02] verse 29 as soon as she heard
[1:20:06] that jesus had come she rose quickly
[1:20:09] and went to meet him
[1:20:11] you see martha the woman the church tops
[1:20:14] the woman
[1:20:15] martha tops the church so martha the
[1:20:18] church comes to mary who's still sitting
[1:20:21] in the house because she lacks
[1:20:23] revelation
[1:20:26] and the church with the message of the
[1:20:29] hour
[1:20:31] comes to mary who's sitting in the house
[1:20:33] and says listen
[1:20:35] i know you're hurting
[1:20:37] i know you have sorrow i know you feel
[1:20:40] depressed i know you're nervous i know
[1:20:42] you feel like your world's caving in i
[1:20:44] know things are happening that you never
[1:20:46] thought would happen but listen mary
[1:20:48] listen
[1:20:50] he's here
[1:20:55] and the bible says when that revelation
[1:20:58] struck her heart married quickly went
[1:21:01] out to meet jesus
[1:21:04] you see when she caught the same
[1:21:06] revelation that martha had it brought
[1:21:08] the same result
[1:21:10] when martha caught the revelation that
[1:21:12] jesus was come she got up and we meet
[1:21:14] him and when mary caught the same
[1:21:16] revelation it brought the same results
[1:21:20] she got up and went and met him
[1:21:25] amen
[1:21:26] amen
[1:21:28] amen
[1:21:30] and i say to you little bride
[1:21:32] i know it's a nervous time
[1:21:34] i know it's an unusual time
[1:21:37] i know it's a time of darkness in the
[1:21:38] time of evil and a time of unrest i
[1:21:41] realized that friends
[1:21:43] but listen
[1:21:44] i've come to tell you
[1:21:47] he's here
[1:21:53] he's right here with us now nothing has
[1:21:56] caught him by surprise this pandemic did
[1:21:58] not catch god by surprise
[1:22:05] the prophet said god's body united is
[1:22:07] his bride being one him and christ
[1:22:09] together has the spirit worked in the
[1:22:11] flesh of the church like it worked in
[1:22:13] the flesh of jesus christ because it's a
[1:22:15] part of his body
[1:22:17] not twain but one they are one a husband
[1:22:20] and wife are no longer two but one and
[1:22:23] christ and his body is one
[1:22:26] and the same spirit that was in christ
[1:22:28] the same spirit that was in christ the
[1:22:31] same spirit that was in christ is in his
[1:22:35] bride
[1:22:37] his body and that unites them together
[1:22:40] with all the word and god living in
[1:22:43] there himself
[1:22:45] manifested
[1:22:47] you see all god was he poured into
[1:22:49] christ and christ is the mystery of god
[1:22:51] revealed and all christ is he has poured
[1:22:54] into his church
[1:22:56] and the church is the revelation
[1:22:59] of jesus christ
[1:23:03] amen
[1:23:04] listen to this
[1:23:07] the prophet said it's the same as it is
[1:23:09] today
[1:23:10] there is many people this quote it just
[1:23:12] makes me sad
[1:23:14] there's many people today that love the
[1:23:17] lord
[1:23:18] and don't realize
[1:23:20] you can tell them about it and yet they
[1:23:22] can't recognize that he's alive
[1:23:25] forevermore
[1:23:26] tonight
[1:23:28] good people that love the lord
[1:23:31] but they fail to recognize
[1:23:34] he's alive forevermore
[1:23:36] he is here in his church
[1:23:39] tonight good people who loved the lord
[1:23:42] but they failed to recognize that he is
[1:23:45] in his church tonight he is in the midst
[1:23:48] of us and will be
[1:23:51] till he comes in a physical corporal
[1:23:55] body
[1:23:57] he said brother what are you saying

[1:59:34] [Applause]
[1:59:39] amen don't you just thank the lord amen
[1:59:43] god is so mindful
[1:59:46] god doesn't do anything there's nothing
[1:59:48] that happens
[1:59:49] in our lives as believers by chance
[1:59:51] there's not even things that even how
[1:59:53] that god will lead the minister things
[1:59:55] to be said things to be called out
[1:59:57] things to be expressed and how god will
[2:00:00] speak personally to our life that's god
[2:00:02] making himself known and that he cares
[2:00:05] amen in everything it's a finished work
[2:00:08] it's just our faith coming into that
[2:00:10] place of a finished work that's how
[2:00:12] personal god is
[2:00:14] just so personal that he'll take
[2:00:16] even
[2:00:17] and how you'll guide the servant of the
[2:00:19] lord tonight every testimony
[2:00:22] is a testimony and a witness that what
[2:00:24] god did for one he'll do it for you
[2:00:27] [Music]
[2:00:29] there's no circumstance no situation
[2:00:32] that's too great
[2:00:34] god is green
[2:00:37] remember brother brahman said it like
[2:00:38] this he said the two greatest enemies
[2:00:41] of faith
[2:00:42] is time
[2:00:44] and feelings
[2:00:45] the two greatest enemies of faith is
[2:00:47] time
[2:00:49] and feelings
[2:00:50] because sometimes with time
[2:00:52] then it gives it an opportunity and the
[2:00:55] enemy can move in well i guess you
[2:00:57] didn't receive anything i guess nothing
[2:00:58] really happened and your feelings
[2:01:01] sometimes with feelings
[2:01:04] you feel worse
[2:01:05] [Music]
[2:01:07] remember what brother branham directed
[2:01:08] us to he said that's a sure sign right
[2:01:10] there
[2:01:13] just like when a person has a cancer and
[2:01:14] that life is cast out
[2:01:17] that cancer itself will get bigger
[2:01:20] but the life's already been spoken to
[2:01:24] time and feelings are the greatest enemy
[2:01:27] of faith but faith can just look at that
[2:01:29] and say god
[2:01:30] just as simple as god brought it here
[2:01:33] tonight
[2:01:34] to simply just like that little woman i
[2:01:36] remember brother daryl here just weeks
[2:01:37] ago sent that on a text on a thread and
[2:01:39] you see that little woman who
[2:01:41] laid down at the altar that night laid
[2:01:43] the alcohol down
[2:01:45] and took up her freedom her liberty in
[2:01:48] jesus christ that's the same thing for
[2:01:50] whatever the need is because you realize
[2:01:53] a sickness it's a tormenting spirit
[2:01:56] when a sickness comes around it can
[2:01:57] torment the spirit it can linger
[2:02:01] but
[2:02:02] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[2:02:04] we can lay it down
[2:02:08] and take up our liberty that belongs to
[2:02:10] us
[2:02:11] you believe that tonight
[2:02:13] he accept it tonight
[2:02:15] denying all feelings denying anything
[2:02:19] of time he said they shall lay hands on
[2:02:21] the sick and they shall recover the
[2:02:23] prayer of faith
[2:02:24] shall save the sick and god shall raise
[2:02:27] them up
[2:02:28] he's faithful
[2:02:30] amen let's just go in the fear of the
[2:02:32] lord
[2:02:33] heavenly fathers we bow our heads
[2:02:35] tonight
[2:02:35] [Music]
[2:02:38] we just know you to be that way
[2:02:41] a personal personal god
[2:02:45] the lord
[2:02:46] you bring
[2:02:48] into our lives
[2:02:50] a personal experience
[2:02:53] lord it's experience after experience
[2:02:57] after experience
[2:03:00] lord jesus
[2:03:00] [Music]
[2:03:02] there
[2:03:03] were needs that were setting here
[2:03:05] tonight
[2:03:07] we want to thank you for coming
[2:03:11] lord whether they were sitting in this
[2:03:12] building
[2:03:14] knowing that some lord are streaming by
[2:03:16] internet even in other states away from
[2:03:18] here
[2:03:20] but lord god
[2:03:22] you'll go to where you're invited
[2:03:26] now father we we just lord
[2:03:28] believe that tonight the prayer faith
[2:03:30] has already been offered up the needs
[2:03:32] have already been presented placed on
[2:03:35] the altar
[2:03:36] and the liberty
[2:03:38] that belongs to us as sons and daughters
[2:03:40] of god
[2:03:41] is taken and we are standing but that
[2:03:44] banner
[2:03:45] raised up the lord
[2:03:48] now father
[2:03:50] we ask that you would go with us lord
[2:03:51] jesus
[2:03:53] and dear god i pray that father even in
[2:03:55] the coming
[2:03:56] moments
[2:03:58] hours days lord
[2:04:01] we ask lord god
[2:04:03] that lord jesus for your grace lord god
[2:04:05] is testimony after testimony lord god of
[2:04:09] your mercy lord god of how that you've
[2:04:12] moved lord god
[2:04:13] faith lord because it wasn't as our
[2:04:15] brother said that you heard blind
[2:04:17] bartimaeus's voice
[2:04:19] it was faith that touched him
[2:04:21] it was lord the woman with the issue of
[2:04:23] blood
[2:04:24] there's no way you could have felt her
[2:04:26] touch through all those garments it was
[2:04:28] her faith
[2:04:29] that stopped you
[2:04:31] the lord jesus that's the same thing
[2:04:33] here tonight you're the same lord jesus
[2:04:36] that come right here tonight lord to
[2:04:38] make yourself known
