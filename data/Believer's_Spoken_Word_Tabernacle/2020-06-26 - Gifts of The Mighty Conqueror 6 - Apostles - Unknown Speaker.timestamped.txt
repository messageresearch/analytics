[37:00] so appreciate them amen and their love
[37:03] for the Lord we just we just want to
[37:07] look to the Lord tonight and ask that
[37:09] God would just speak to us tonight we
[37:11] need to hear from him we need to hear
[37:15] from him verse 7 but unto every one of
[37:18] us is given grace according to the
[37:21] measure of the gift of Christ wherefore
[37:26] he saith when he ascended on high he led
[37:29] captivity captive and gave gifts unto
[37:33] men that's what I want you to notice
[37:36] here what's the purpose of these gifts
[37:40] now that he ascended what is it but that
[37:44] he also descended first into the lower
[37:49] parts of the earth he that descended is
[37:53] the same also that ascended up far above
[37:58] all heavens that he might fill all
[38:02] things that's to feel complete satisfy
[38:09] performed all things verse 11 and he
[38:14] gave some apostles some prophets and
[38:18] some evangelists and some pastors and
[38:22] teachers may God bless his word bless
[38:25] the reading of it as you're being seated
[38:29] so these gifts as we're looking at this
[38:32] here tonight as we've been looking at
[38:34] that the gifts of the mighty Conqueror
[38:37] we know that each one of these gifts as
[38:40] well as each and every life that God
[38:43] would Tabernacle himself in is a witness
[38:46] and is to be a witness of the Living God
[38:50] and God would use man he would take that
[38:54] of man and God would so through the
[38:58] gifts that God would place within a life
[39:00] and we understand that those gifts are
[39:02] not things that men would themselves a
[39:06] sin to it's very much like what it was
[39:09] in the time I think it's in second
[39:11] chronicles where it speaks where the
[39:13] presence of God came down in the temple
[39:15] and when Solomon had dedicated it there
[39:17] were men that stood by to wait to see
[39:20] what God would appoint for them to do
[39:23] it's not something that we choose as a
[39:25] matter of fact every one of these gifts
[39:27] were looking at as we started last week
[39:29] to look at that of apostle it's not
[39:31] something that someone starts out that
[39:34] it's something that they want to do but
[39:36] it's rather it's a burden that God would
[39:39] place on that heart and God would so fit
[39:41] even the very nature and the makeup of
[39:43] that man that it would work
[39:45] complementary even to the gift that God
[39:48] has placed in his life and to remember
[39:50] that when we look here in this in this
[39:53] of the gifts we know that these gifts
[39:56] are to proclaim if you think about when
[39:58] Elijah himself when he was moved upon
[40:03] when Elijah put the mantle upon him and
[40:05] he begins to follow Elijah he makes one
[40:08] request and his request is that a double
[40:11] portion of that spirit would come upon
[40:14] me and you remember the statement that
[40:16] Elijah made and all of this in a type
[40:19] here where he made the statement that if
[40:23] thou seus me when I go then you shall
[40:26] have the request that has been upon your
[40:29] heart it was God who put that burden in
[40:33] Elijah's heart to ask for that double
[40:35] portion we know that whereas I believe
[40:37] it was Elijah with four miracles and we
[40:40] see Elijah
[40:41] with eight miracles it was God even
[40:43] testifying in that working of what he
[40:45] would do in his own mystical body after
[40:49] that he would raise from the grave and
[40:52] he would ascend on hind sent back the
[40:54] Holy Ghost there was a need that they'd
[40:57] that the disciples themselves would
[40:59] witness the resurrection of the Lord
[41:02] Jesus Christ they would be dialed into
[41:04] that because the Holy Ghost was talent
[41:07] was tied in to that reality of the
[41:10] resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ
[41:12] and so when we look at this of the
[41:15] Apostles it was of where this word that
[41:19] we we see here as we were looking at it
[41:22] last week it is a word the word apostle
[41:24] is a word that many times is used
[41:27] interchangeably with missionary one who
[41:30] is sent and when we look at this we
[41:33] recognize that when Paul would even
[41:35] write of this and pulling it out of
[41:37] inspiration from the Book of Isaiah that
[41:40] that that how beautiful are the feet of
[41:43] them that that publish the gospel of
[41:46] peace and it would speak that they would
[41:48] be sent to proclaim the name of the Lord
[41:51] now to think of this that there that the
[41:54] people themselves might call upon the
[41:56] name of the Lord he would speak of the
[41:58] redemptive work of Almighty God it's in
[42:02] other words it's to ask for what has
[42:04] been revealed and who God has declared
[42:08] himself to be how could you know what is
[42:11] available to you unless it is proclaimed
[42:14] to you and once it's proclaimed to you
[42:16] then you can ask for what is spoken
[42:19] directly to you and so this is why Paul
[42:22] would pick that up in Romans 10 how
[42:25] shall they preach except they be sent
[42:27] now we realize it's not men sending men
[42:31] because that'll never work but it's got
[42:33] to be God God called man it's God
[42:37] sending men as Plato Peter would say to
[42:40] preach this gospel with the Holy Ghost
[42:42] sent down from heaven it's not enough
[42:45] for the words of man we cannot we can
[42:47] reason with people we can try to exhort
[42:51] him and dispute about scripture but that
[42:53] brings the conversion it can be things
[42:56] that might open people's minds but that
[42:58] is not what the Lord Jesus even meant
[43:01] when he spoke this in the word in
[43:03] Matthew 28:18 let's look here he says
[43:06] Jesus came and spake unto them saying
[43:09] all power is given unto me in heaven and
[43:13] in earth he's declaring himself I'm the
[43:18] mighty Conqueror go ye therefore and
[43:21] teach all nations baptizing them in the
[43:25] name of the Father and of the Son and of
[43:29] the Holy Ghost teaching them to observe
[43:32] all things whatsoever I have commanded
[43:35] you and lo I am with you all the way
[43:39] even to the end of the world amen now we
[43:42] recognize as Bible readers that this
[43:45] that the happenings even in the
[43:47] scripture and even what God would be
[43:50] doing present even within our lives we
[43:52] must be able to find his working in our
[43:56] lives
[43:56] within the scripture if it's God working
[44:00] in our lives it must be him working all
[44:02] the way through in our life that places
[44:05] us in the scripture now think about it
[44:07] here is the greatest Wow if we could say
[44:10] it like this the greatest newsflash
[44:12] that's ever struck the face of the earth
[44:14] is when he rose on that Easter morning
[44:17] and when he would announce to them and
[44:20] he would reveal to them that I am deed
[44:22] am Alive I'm he who was dead but now I
[44:26] am Alive for evermore they would they
[44:29] were going from a situation where they
[44:32] were discouraged they were disheartened
[44:34] but notice how the revealed word of the
[44:36] hour reached out to them it didn't
[44:39] appear to calluses it didn't appear to
[44:41] any of the unbelievers or the make
[44:43] believers it only appeared to those as
[44:45] Peter would say those who were chosen of
[44:48] God to witness this and how that he made
[44:52] himself known to them and told them go
[44:55] wait until you are endued with power
[44:57] from on high
[44:58] it was not enough that they would have a
[45:01] knowledge of personal acquaintance if
[45:03] that was not a
[45:04] to hold them they themselves had to
[45:07] become United with that same God who had
[45:11] come down from glory and had fulfilled
[45:13] the promises of His Word and now we make
[45:16] way for the Holy Ghost to come upon the
[45:19] lives of the believer where by putting
[45:22] God back in some of his people amen the
[45:27] same God who walked with them in the
[45:29] beginning now that same God through the
[45:32] appropriate appropriation of his son now
[45:35] the blood and made a way for him to come
[45:38] back down and live inside of his
[45:41] children
[45:42] this was the ant attack the fulfillment
[45:46] of the type of the Jubilee the Jubilee
[45:52] sound remember Jesus said I'm come to
[45:55] preach the acceptable year now remember
[45:57] here in the Ministry of the Lord Jesus
[46:00] the Son of Man the sick were healed
[46:02] demons were cast out lives were set free
[46:05] that was the Ministry of the son of man
[46:08] announcing the Jubilee is getting ready
[46:11] to strike that word already was there in
[46:14] power it was representing in a life
[46:17] glory be to God it was represented in
[46:20] the life of the Lord Jesus as a witness
[46:23] and a type of what you have seen it do
[46:26] in the groom it will do the same thing
[46:29] in the bride because it will be that
[46:32] same original life come back in Bride
[46:35] form and that's just what happened on
[46:38] the day of Pentecost we're talking about
[46:41] an acceptable year we're talking about
[46:43] the Jubilee
[46:45] that of the Jubilee when it would sound
[46:48] it was once every 50 years he did not
[46:51] matter what anybody that had come into
[46:55] they sold themselves into slavery maybe
[46:58] they couldn't pay a debt but you
[47:00] remember the land God told him the land
[47:04] is not yours to sell you might come into
[47:08] a debt but that land still belongs to
[47:10] you because God said the land belongs to
[47:13] me I'm the one who has given you that
[47:15] land but when the time would come for
[47:18] the Jubilee and the sounding of that
[47:20] Jubilee that trumpet itself was the
[47:24] sounding of authority because the
[47:27] atonement had been offered up that had
[47:29] been accepted in the Lamb that lamb had
[47:32] been offered up the blood had been shed
[47:34] now the sounding was a sounding for what
[47:38] others could not see was taking place
[47:41] and the blood was accepted the gospel
[47:44] the sounding out was to let him know
[47:46] that has been accepted and they can take
[47:50] their Liberty when they heard the
[47:53] sounding of the trumpet that's what God
[47:57] when he would send out the apostles and
[47:59] a gret it registers through every heart
[48:02] it should register in every life there
[48:05] should be a proclaiming of Liberty I
[48:08] once was bound but now I'm free
[48:11] hey man I've been made free by the power
[48:15] of Almighty God
[48:16] I've been loosed from Satan's hold upon
[48:19] my life
[48:19] you can return back to your original
[48:22] inheritance no questions asked you don't
[48:27] have to ask nobody the hearing of that
[48:29] trumpet gives you the authority to throw
[48:32] down that tool that Powe whatever it is
[48:35] that's in your head you can throw it
[48:36] down did not have to be pried out of
[48:38] your hands you can throw it down and
[48:40] return to what rightfully belongs to you
[48:42] you see it's calling you to what belongs
[48:45] to you now when we look at this here on
[48:51] the day of Pentecost
[48:53] this is where Jesus told him I want you
[48:56] to go hide this is where I want you to
[48:58] go to Jerusalem and I want you to wait
[49:00] to you endued with power from on high
[49:03] let's look at the spokesman here Peter
[49:05] one on one of the one of the Twelve
[49:08] Apostles the Bible says in acts 2 verse
[49:11] 1 and when the day of Pentecost was
[49:15] fully come this was not a type now this
[49:18] was the fulfillment what all the type
[49:21] had been about year after year of
[49:23] keeping the Pentecost now it was indeed
[49:25] the fulfillment they were all with one
[49:28] Accord in one place and suddenly there
[49:31] came a sound from heaven as of a rushing
[49:33] mighty wind and it filled all the house
[49:36] where they were sitting and there
[49:38] appeared unto them cloven tongues like
[49:40] as of fire and it's set upon each of
[49:43] them and they were all filled with the
[49:45] Holy Ghost and began to speak with other
[49:47] tongues as the Spirit gave them
[49:49] utterance I want you to look how God's
[49:52] perfect timing not only everything had
[49:57] lined up exactly with that of the feast
[50:00] the Feast of the Lord how God had so
[50:02] lined that up but to think that there
[50:05] the Bible were going to say there were
[50:07] devout Jews from all these other nations
[50:10] around the mouth were gathered there at
[50:12] this time it was a very significant
[50:16] important feast and they were there at
[50:19] this time now here's what's taking place
[50:21] when they begin to hear this the Bible
[50:24] would go on to talk about how that they
[50:27] were hearing what was being spoken now
[50:30] this is this is the whole part the
[50:32] miracle was not in the speaking they
[50:35] were speaking like I am speaking now but
[50:38] then what it was was the miracle that
[50:41] was the hearing that was going on in the
[50:43] ears is that right the Bible would say
[50:46] behold our nothing's all which speak
[50:48] their galilaeans but God the Spirit of
[50:51] God was present and interpreting the
[50:53] work of God in their own native language
[50:56] it wasn't an unknown tongue it was a no
[50:59] tongue
[51:01] amen God's got to get a message out so
[51:04] people's gotta understand it Amen God
[51:08] was also giving a clear witness that
[51:11] this gospel it's gonna go to every
[51:14] nation verse 11 says the crease to hear
[51:22] that says we do hear them speak in our
[51:25] tongues the wonderful works of God and
[51:29] they were all amazed and were in doubt
[51:32] and sang one to another what meaneth is
[51:35] others were mocking saying these men are
[51:38] full of new wine but Peter standing up
[51:41] with the eleven notice Peter stands up
[51:44] with the eleven here hears here is the
[51:47] spokesman on the day of Pentecost here
[51:50] is a servant an apostle of God amen he
[51:54] knows his position the Holy Spirit has
[51:57] made him aware of his position notice
[52:00] the Spirit of God has the Lord Jesus
[52:02] would let him know what's your strength
[52:05] and then you strengthen your brethren he
[52:09] knew what God had called him to do he
[52:11] stands up with the eleven here here's an
[52:13] apostle and said unto them ye men of
[52:16] Judea and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem
[52:18] be this known unto you and hearken to my
[52:22] words for these are not drunken as you
[52:25] suppose seeing it is but the third hour
[52:28] of the day hallelujah he knows what has
[52:32] happened in his life he is died he is
[52:36] identifying what is taking place
[52:38] Hisle is the word happening in my life
[52:44] oh I can't help but drift back to whom
[52:49] God had got ahold of my life in the work
[52:51] that God has done in my life others one
[52:54] they don't know what to expect they
[52:56] don't even know how to describe it
[52:57] oh he got sent off to a church camp he
[52:59] got brainwashed his mom and daddy took
[53:01] ahold of it or this and that these are
[53:03] the statements but all my brother and
[53:05] sister when you meet God on those sacred
[53:08] sand it ain't nothing you're trying to
[53:10] keep but you've met Almighty God who
[53:13] keeps every promise and he himself who
[53:16] made the promise he comes to make that
[53:19] promise of living reality they met in
[53:23] lifts you both sin changes that old
[53:28] nature oh my I'm trying my best not to
[53:33] preach but this is that notice what
[53:36] Peter this is that which was spoken by
[53:40] the Prophet Joel notice an apostle he's
[53:43] taken him right into the word this is
[53:47] the boldness of the land of the tribe of
[53:50] Judah that's crying out he identifies I
[53:55] don't know if I had time to read it
[53:56] but Peter here he is identifying the
[53:59] promise that they're witnessing they
[54:03] don't know what what meaneth this but
[54:05] Peter is going to identify the promise
[54:07] he reaches and pulls out the promise of
[54:10] the outpouring of the Holy Ghost he
[54:12] pulls the promise there of what David
[54:15] had spoke concerning the Messiah and in
[54:18] verse 22 he says he men of Israel hear
[54:20] these words is not is not it not an
[54:26] option
[54:26] hear these words you need to hear these
[54:29] words Jesus of Nazareth a man approved
[54:33] of God among you by miracles and wonders
[54:36] and signs which God did by him in the
[54:40] midst of you as you yourselves also know
[54:43] him being delivered by the determinate
[54:46] counsel and foreknowledge of God you
[54:48] have taken and by wicked hands have
[54:50] crucified and slain my goodness it had
[54:54] to be the boldness of the Lion of the
[54:56] tribe of Judah to stand right there
[54:58] and express these things is that right
[55:01] whom God hath raised up having loosed
[55:04] the pains of death because it was not
[55:07] possible that he should be holding of it
[55:09] for David spoke concerning him I foresaw
[55:12] the Lord always before my faith for he
[55:14] is on my right hand that I should not be
[55:16] moved
[55:17] therefore did my heart rejoice and my
[55:19] tongue was glad moreover also my flesh
[55:22] shall rest in hope because thou will not
[55:25] leave my soul in Hell neither wilt thou
[55:27] suffer thine Holy One to see corruption
[55:29] Val has made known to me the ways of
[55:33] life thou shalt make me full of joy with
[55:36] that countenance you see what the Spirit
[55:38] of God is doing this is not Peter trying
[55:42] to find things that will that will
[55:44] identify the happening but the Spirit of
[55:47] God has quickened the promises to him
[55:50] that belong to him they are glowing up
[55:52] there listen now they went up there in
[55:54] the upper room not with wondering what's
[55:57] going to happen but there was a clarity
[55:59] the word had given them leadership for
[56:03] what was coming and what they were to
[56:06] expect God has given us clear leadership
[56:10] he's honed and rannian in this hour for
[56:12] what you and I are to expect hallelujah
[56:17] amen any moment and that twinkling of an
[56:20] eye we shall be changed
[56:23] they met God provides leadership from
[56:27] one feast to another he provides
[56:29] leadership for his children to be home
[56:32] in with a true expectation this is a
[56:37] word but the Spirit of God is quickening
[56:40] notice what David was uttering by the
[56:44] Spirit of God of what shall be now the
[56:48] same spirit that moved through David is
[56:51] declaring through Peter what was a
[56:55] future event is Matt made clear by
[56:59] prophecy amen thou has made known to me
[57:02] the ways of life thou shalt make me full
[57:06] of joy with that countenance his
[57:08] presence his face his person
[57:11] rather and let me freely speak unto you
[57:13] the patriarch David that he's both dead
[57:16] and buried and his Sepulchre is with us
[57:18] unto this day therefore being a prophet
[57:20] and knowing that God has sworn with an
[57:22] oath to him that of the fruit of his
[57:24] loins according to the flesh he would
[57:27] raise up Christ to sit on his throne
[57:29] he's seeing this before spake of the
[57:33] resurrection of Christ that his soul was
[57:36] not left in Hell neither his flesh did
[57:39] see corruption
[57:40] this Jesus met his hazard in this Jesus
[57:44] hath God raised up whereof we all our
[57:47] witnesses therefore being by the right
[57:51] hand of God exalted and having received
[57:54] of the father the promise of the Holy
[57:56] Ghost
[57:57] he had shed forth this which ye now see
[58:01] in here he's declaring what you're
[58:04] seeing and what you're hearing is the
[58:06] Holy Ghost this is the promise this is
[58:10] that which was well now it's made flesh
[58:12] Oh glory
[58:15] it wasn't Peter just expressing this but
[58:17] the Holy Ghost was there to back it up
[58:20] for David oh these are powerful
[58:22] scriptures for David is not ascended
[58:24] into the heavens but he saith of himself
[58:27] the Lord said unto my lord sit thou on
[58:30] my right hand until I make back foes by
[58:34] foot store
[58:36] therefore let all the house of Israel
[58:38] know assuredly that God hath made that
[58:41] same Jesus whom ye have crucified both
[58:45] Lord and Christ and what you think of
[58:50] this here here when he has it's
[58:53] identified he is seated in power the
[58:58] promises that now have been made now
[59:01] there is a body on the throne not a sea
[59:03] off any body but now that same body that
[59:06] God created and came down here and lived
[59:09] in and did the redemptive work he raised
[59:12] up that same body and it seated at the
[59:14] right hand not the right hand but in the
[59:16] throne see that in power him at all
[59:20] power is given unto me hey man is seated
[59:25] in authority and that authority is that
[59:28] now which is ministered to the sons and
[59:31] daughters of God as the Liberty to
[59:34] proclaim you are free oh god help me
[59:41] tonight this supernatural manifestation
[59:45] it was lifting up when the Bible says
[59:48] there that there were many that heard
[59:51] and how that when they were coming out
[59:55] of their the upper room staggering and
[59:59] everybody found they thought they were
[1:00:01] drunk now once you watch the
[1:00:03] supernatural working was taking place
[1:00:05] what the people were hearing was the
[1:00:08] wonderful works of God everybody that
[1:00:11] came out of there listen to me everybody
[1:00:13] that came out of there they had they
[1:00:15] were sharing in this same testimony that
[1:00:18] Peter was a spokesman of they were
[1:00:21] representative of the message that was
[1:00:24] being proclaimed Amen they had met that
[1:00:28] same God and it was the wonderful works
[1:00:30] of God that was being proclaimed now the
[1:00:33] think of this this it would declare the
[1:00:35] manifestation of God's promise in this
[1:00:38] hour that he's now seated in power
[1:00:42] just as he rose from the grave it was a
[1:00:46] message to let them know just as he
[1:00:49] arose and he is overthrown death and sin
[1:00:53] has been conquered that message would go
[1:00:56] that to the children to let them know
[1:00:59] that it is your turn it is now for you
[1:01:03] to be raised in power it is time for you
[1:01:06] to be raised in power over sin over
[1:01:11] unbelief over death over fear over
[1:01:15] skepticism it's time to be raised what
[1:01:17] by that same power that raised up Christ
[1:01:21] from the dead you see you got to know
[1:01:25] what's available to you before you can
[1:01:26] ever ask you know what Peter was
[1:01:30] preaching to him he was preaching the
[1:01:31] coming of the Lord now I wasn't
[1:01:35] preaching just the coming of the Lord
[1:01:37] back and putting it back on Calvary or
[1:01:40] putting it in the tomb now that wasn't
[1:01:42] that one that done you well well enough
[1:01:43] he was preaching the coming of the Lord
[1:01:45] that that same God who came from glory
[1:01:49] who walked in flesh among us who rose
[1:01:52] from the grave that the Holy Ghost is
[1:01:56] the same God now living inside of his
[1:01:59] people he was preaching the coming of
[1:02:02] the Lord
[1:02:03] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost you see
[1:02:06] the Apostles understood that there must
[1:02:09] be a coming of the Holy Ghost in you in
[1:02:13] order for you to be ready for the
[1:02:15] literal physical corporal coming of the
[1:02:18] Lord
[1:02:19] Laure meter god oh my so now he's
[1:02:24] declaring this resurrection you're a
[1:02:27] beneficiary of it verse 37 said when
[1:02:32] they heard this they were pricked in
[1:02:36] their hearts and they said to Peter and
[1:02:40] to the rest of the Apostles men and
[1:02:42] brethren what shall we do this is key
[1:02:47] now remember the acceptable year in
[1:02:50] order to come back to the inheritance
[1:02:53] key has got to be term just right are
[1:02:56] you with me now you see the path back it
[1:03:00] must be a word path back the only way to
[1:03:04] get back to then inheritance it's got to
[1:03:06] be the path of the word is that right so
[1:03:10] this path of the word and man may have
[1:03:12] been revealed to them quicken to them
[1:03:15] they were partakers of that but now
[1:03:18] through this revealed word what's how
[1:03:20] what what exactly that they're going to
[1:03:22] express repent and be baptized every one
[1:03:26] of you in the name of Jesus Christ for
[1:03:30] the remission of sins what was it the
[1:03:33] revelation of the name of the Father and
[1:03:36] of the Son and of the Holy Ghost those
[1:03:39] are titles it was the name the name was
[1:03:42] revealed it was that name they meant
[1:03:48] Jesus as that of a human made God came
[1:03:51] down in Redemption to redeem us back to
[1:03:54] himself that is our sacrifice our
[1:03:57] Passover lamb and Peter having the keys
[1:04:01] opening it to the Jews repent and be
[1:04:04] baptized every one of you in the name of
[1:04:07] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins
[1:04:09] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:04:13] Holy Ghost he goes on to say for the
[1:04:17] promises unto you and to your children
[1:04:19] and to them that's far off even as many
[1:04:22] as the Lord our God shall call he is a
[1:04:25] very important work as an apostle if he
[1:04:27] don't set it right it's going to mess
[1:04:29] everything up you mean God wouldn't
[1:04:33] trust his word to men God and trust his
[1:04:36] word to himself that's why I said wait
[1:04:40] until you endued with power from on high
[1:04:42] because it would be God now in the feet
[1:04:46] of his children carrying his word that's
[1:04:48] why the Bible said in Isaiah 52 how
[1:04:50] beautiful are the feet of him that
[1:04:54] terror is its Christ dressed up in his
[1:04:56] church Alleluia
[1:04:59] you got us started right if you don't
[1:05:01] start it right you know air out when it
[1:05:03] gets way on down the road
[1:05:04] every word matters is that right that's
[1:05:10] why one of the Apostles written by wrote
[1:05:12] my inspiration would say whosoever
[1:05:13] hadith the word or taketh away a word
[1:05:15] his pot will be taken away out of the
[1:05:18] book of life so when you see here then
[1:05:22] as the Bible goes on to say and many
[1:05:25] other words verse 40 did he testify and
[1:05:27] exhort saying save yourselves from this
[1:05:29] untoward generation then they that
[1:05:32] gladly received his word were baptized
[1:05:35] and the same day there were added unto
[1:05:37] them about 3,000 souls the Holy Ghost
[1:05:42] flowed through the word and pricked the
[1:05:46] heart did it break the heart everybody
[1:05:49] know though there are those who mocked
[1:05:54] it enough it didn't affect him unless
[1:05:57] they got turned around the word was
[1:06:00] preached he didn't mean everybody heard
[1:06:02] it but those who heard it it was
[1:06:06] something that took place inside of
[1:06:08] their life while the word was being
[1:06:11] preached it was a yielding and an open
[1:06:14] you see before God can ever do anything
[1:06:16] for a heart that heart first of all has
[1:06:19] to be opened it has to be turned to him
[1:06:24] now when he noticed this this same
[1:06:26] message as you as Bible readers would
[1:06:29] see talking about the Apostles and Alan
[1:06:31] sent sent to carry this message as Jesus
[1:06:35] said go you therefore into all the world
[1:06:38] this was the same message that they
[1:06:41] preached when the angel of the Lord came
[1:06:45] and set him free after the Sadducees
[1:06:47] threw him into prison I want you to
[1:06:49] notice what the religious did in that
[1:06:51] day there was nobody more religious than
[1:06:54] the Pharisees and Sadducees but in the
[1:06:58] Bible it speaks openly how that they
[1:07:01] themselves even begin to persecute that
[1:07:04] work and even witnessing the Living God
[1:07:07] moving would tell them they would beat
[1:07:09] him and they were telling don't you go
[1:07:11] out of here anymore teaching in this
[1:07:13] name
[1:07:15] they couldn't deny it
[1:07:18] they could not deny the working it was
[1:07:21] the same message the same message that
[1:07:23] Steven preached same message when there
[1:07:30] were men
[1:07:31] the Bible says suborned men who were
[1:07:34] stirred up by others and paid off
[1:07:36] go strut trouble against even men in
[1:07:39] that measure it was Philip who preached
[1:07:44] in Samaria and Peter came behind and lay
[1:07:48] hands on them and they received the Holy
[1:07:50] Ghost this it was the same Philip who
[1:07:54] preached to the Ethiopian eunuch these
[1:07:59] funds are making mention here is because
[1:08:02] these men had been in the same Upper
[1:08:06] Room they had the same experience they
[1:08:09] came for preaching the same message they
[1:08:14] had met the same Jesus they knew him to
[1:08:19] be the same and what they preached was
[1:08:22] bad a divinely revealed experience in
[1:08:26] their life here come the keys
[1:08:31] Peter here there's been an unlocking an
[1:08:35] unlocking of the Jews unlock into the
[1:08:38] Jumeirah to remember the three races of
[1:08:39] people and Sam and Jeff as people Jews
[1:08:42] Samaritans Gentiles now here it comes in
[1:08:45] acts 10 notice here is the house of
[1:08:47] Cornelius Cornelius is a devout man
[1:08:52] he's by the way the Scriptures as it
[1:08:55] would put in verse 22 he's one that
[1:08:57] feared God and of a good rapport among
[1:09:00] all the nations of the Jews was warned
[1:09:03] from God ban Holy Angel to sin for thee
[1:09:07] into his house and to hear words of V
[1:09:11] then the angel know the words
[1:09:15] shredding angel knew all about it he
[1:09:18] knew but you see God had not called
[1:09:22] angels to carry his word God has called
[1:09:27] man to carry the word that man would be
[1:09:31] a yielded vessel unto Him is that right
[1:09:35] not to think of this how that we
[1:09:37] recognize within it that when we see
[1:09:40] Cornelius Cornelius is how he has the
[1:09:42] scriptures he has the prophecies matter
[1:09:44] of fact everything that Peter is going
[1:09:46] to come down there and preach these are
[1:09:49] not things that he doesn't already know
[1:09:53] by scripture but the difference is is
[1:09:57] how that God would place it and say tell
[1:10:01] through an angel he said I want you to
[1:10:03] send up to Joppa I want you to send for
[1:10:07] one whose name is Simon and imitating
[1:10:10] his surname his surname is Peter what
[1:10:15] God was doing there
[1:10:16] he was also dealing on Peters in God
[1:10:20] knew in order to get Peter yielded has a
[1:10:23] vessel although the gift of an apostle
[1:10:26] was in his life but he had to get him
[1:10:28] yielded to take this message to the
[1:10:31] Gentiles of Cornelius house because
[1:10:34] remember when he saw all of those beasts
[1:10:37] he said they're unclean and what did God
[1:10:39] say because of the old sufficient work
[1:10:42] of Calvary don't you call that unclean
[1:10:45] which may cleave what's he doing he's
[1:10:50] giving him the authority to stand on
[1:10:53] that world and to proclaim that though
[1:10:56] you are unclean in your life but there
[1:10:59] is a cleansing you were mention and made
[1:11:03] known of in Calvary he came bearing a
[1:11:10] word of authority for their life the
[1:11:15] Bible says in verse 44 while Peter yet
[1:11:18] spake these words
[1:11:20] the Holy Ghost fell on them which heard
[1:11:24] the word while they heard the word the
[1:11:27] Holy Ghost came down fill them right
[1:11:29] there while they heard the word the Holy
[1:11:32] Ghost filled you see it's God you can't
[1:11:36] control how God's going to do it
[1:11:39] you can't even limit God to an altar to
[1:11:42] a Pew to a church service you can't
[1:11:44] limit God truly a heart that gets to
[1:11:46] hungered for God they need trying to put
[1:11:48] God in the box because they already know
[1:11:50] he's above all things
[1:11:52] he's a cloud of his word the same God
[1:11:56] that met buddy Robinson in the field
[1:11:58] saying God met the Prophet in the cave
[1:12:00] he's the same God that'll meet you when
[1:12:03] you meet him on the conditions of the
[1:12:04] way he'll come to your eyes hair brother
[1:12:10] you know what this ministry of apostles
[1:12:12] it lets the children of God know there
[1:12:15] is an authority all you have to do is
[1:12:18] say I accept it I receive what belongs
[1:12:24] to me
[1:12:32] and we see they were they went on and
[1:12:36] they were baptized in the name of the
[1:12:40] Lord
[1:12:40] I often believe with all my heart now
[1:12:43] this isn't this is this is just this is
[1:12:45] brother Sam you know I don't preach
[1:12:46] brother Samuel but you look at how God
[1:12:48] did it here God by his Spirit made a
[1:12:52] declaration to them and how that he came
[1:12:55] upon them and the living reality the
[1:12:58] same way it fell on them at the
[1:13:00] beginning nobody could deny him entry
[1:13:04] you know why God had brought him in it 1
[1:13:10] Peter that brought the Jews in in the
[1:13:11] beginning it was God who brought him in
[1:13:13] by a promise the Gentiles were included
[1:13:16] in this promise then the Bible says can
[1:13:19] any man forbid water then they were
[1:13:22] baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:13:24] so was the opening of the way of the
[1:13:28] veil of the flesh it was a way of
[1:13:32] Liberty that had been proclaimed I tell
[1:13:35] you anytime we see just right here in
[1:13:37] this description anytime that the
[1:13:41] original message is preached where the
[1:13:43] same original life it'll bring the same
[1:13:46] results what are those results it brings
[1:13:49] the word flesh in the body of believers
[1:13:54] it brings Christ preeminent in the
[1:13:57] believer not ideas of man not the
[1:14:01] thoughts and creeds and um but it brings
[1:14:03] Christ present and when Christ comes
[1:14:06] president brother he will calls if
[1:14:09] there's any thought that's out alive if
[1:14:10] there's anything that's wrong he himself
[1:14:13] because the love in the heart for the
[1:14:15] believer for Christ for the word they
[1:14:17] will relinquish anything that they see
[1:14:20] is contrary to the word and the stand
[1:14:23] upon that word you see they were running
[1:14:26] with the Kings message
[1:14:28] but they could preach that they were
[1:14:30] running with the Kings message when they
[1:14:32] came out of the upper room they got the
[1:14:33] scepter of the King in their hand they
[1:14:35] meant like Esther when hear Haman was
[1:14:38] after the scepter had been extended
[1:14:40] it was the scepter of righteousness Amen
[1:14:44] the devils were shaken come on now a man
[1:14:49] when the healings and the signs and
[1:14:51] wonders begin to take place the devil
[1:14:54] started getting nervous
[1:14:57] now I want to just deal with this part
[1:15:00] of it in in that of the Apostles the
[1:15:04] supernatural being done it's just the
[1:15:08] same way it was in the Ministry of the
[1:15:11] Lord Jesus the Bible would say his fame
[1:15:14] went throughout all the regions it was a
[1:15:16] supernatural accompaniment of
[1:15:20] that had drawn the people to hear what
[1:15:23] they needed to hear the supernatural is
[1:15:26] only a sign that's trying to point the
[1:15:28] people to the Living God as among us are
[1:15:32] you with me God still uses the
[1:15:36] supernatural working
[1:15:39] so matter of fact the word alone is not
[1:15:42] enough
[1:15:43] it takes the supernatural God God proves
[1:15:49] himself alive today the very last verses
[1:15:55] in Matt mark 16 verse 19 so then after
[1:15:59] the Lord had spoken to them he was
[1:16:00] received up into heaven and sat on the
[1:16:03] right hand of God and they went forth
[1:16:06] and preached everywhere the Lord working
[1:16:10] with them and confirming the word with
[1:16:14] signs following
[1:16:18] sometimes the signs they'll come out
[1:16:21] right then in there as the word has
[1:16:23] preached and then there's other times
[1:16:25] the signs will follow after the word has
[1:16:28] already found its place here with me
[1:16:31] every generation this is laugh but the
[1:16:34] man would make this this declaration
[1:16:36] here every generation must have a chance
[1:16:40] at the fresh word of God it can't be a
[1:16:43] hand-me-down I can't hand anything down
[1:16:47] to my children it ain't enough that
[1:16:49] they're in this church they've gotta
[1:16:52] have their own personal experience with
[1:16:57] the same God it's the same way for
[1:17:00] everybody in the search it ain't enough
[1:17:02] just come into this church because my
[1:17:04] momma come to the church
[1:17:05] my daddy come to this church God don't
[1:17:07] have grandchildren
[1:17:09] he has sons and daughters that he
[1:17:12] himself that's by his Spirit through his
[1:17:15] word the program of God will not be
[1:17:21] defeated I mean just an asset to hell it
[1:17:24] will not be defeated he will feel all
[1:17:28] things he will complete and accomplish
[1:17:33] and perform his word to each generation
[1:17:37] it's just like when a priest one who
[1:17:41] would become of an age in Israel to
[1:17:43] enter into the priesthood they
[1:17:45] themselves has entering into the
[1:17:47] priesthood they would have that
[1:17:49] privilege to eat some of the same
[1:17:51] original manna that fell on that first
[1:17:54] day that matter itself is life it's the
[1:17:58] bread of life Jesus said I am that bread
[1:18:01] of life he that eats of me though he
[1:18:04] were dead yet shall he live
[1:18:06] it's speaking of that stuff of life that
[1:18:09] of his own life
[1:18:10] it's the privilege of every believer to
[1:18:14] eat that same original manner that same
[1:18:17] original life oh brother
[1:18:20] hey man God seen God already seen all
[1:18:25] the way down remember even Paul when
[1:18:27] Paul would gather you know the the the
[1:18:30] bishops
[1:18:31] overseers he would gather them at
[1:18:33] Ephesus and he let him know they're
[1:18:35] going to be grievious wolves there will
[1:18:37] be men rise up from among you speaking
[1:18:39] perverse things but he said I commend
[1:18:41] you to the word of grace which is able
[1:18:42] to build you up Paul was recognizing one
[1:18:45] thing though the rest of the church and
[1:18:48] they did not know that there would be
[1:18:50] how many ages how long but to thank God
[1:18:53] himself would preserve this original
[1:18:57] outpouring God knew that the church
[1:19:00] themselves they would after that of
[1:19:02] Pentecost and entering into that
[1:19:04] Ephesian age 33 years later he knew that
[1:19:08] they themselves they would start to go
[1:19:10] in an organizational form but God made a
[1:19:12] promise that for every age that there
[1:19:15] would be that of a representation one
[1:19:18] who would be sent that's one of the
[1:19:20] seven stars in the right hand of God
[1:19:23] they would have the power of Jesus
[1:19:25] Christ behind them they will have that
[1:19:27] same original power that of the same
[1:19:30] Godhead they would stand upon that word
[1:19:33] and proclaim that there is the same
[1:19:36] original manner God knew the church
[1:19:40] would drift off into forms they were
[1:19:43] drift off in the programs they were
[1:19:45] drift away from the original life but
[1:19:48] God himself remember he is Jehovah Jireh
[1:19:51] he has not entrusted his program to no
[1:19:55] man but God Himself has come down to
[1:19:58] fulfill and to complete this work
[1:20:03] he knew he's fulfilling what he spoke to
[1:20:06] Zachariah and he showed Zachariah the
[1:20:08] seven golden candlesticks and he showed
[1:20:11] of what is this I don't know what is it
[1:20:13] not by might not by power but by my
[1:20:15] spirit saith the Lord
[1:20:17] this mountain shall be removed so that
[1:20:22] God would be fulfilling his word in
[1:20:25] every age they have a fresh chance at
[1:20:30] the Word of God sure there'd be things
[1:20:33] that were lost water baptism many
[1:20:37] different doctrines were lost but God
[1:20:39] said I will restore
[1:20:41] now I want you to catch this part here
[1:20:44] because the Bible goes on with that of
[1:20:48] the supernatural there's so many
[1:20:50] accounts I'm just not gonna read them
[1:20:51] all but I want you to catch a few things
[1:20:54] here and that's five verse twelve and by
[1:20:57] the hands of the Apostles were many
[1:20:59] signs and wonders wrought among the
[1:21:01] people and they were all with one Accord
[1:21:04] in Solomon's porch and of the rest
[1:21:06] there's no man joined himself to them
[1:21:08] but the people magnified them and
[1:21:10] believers the more were added to the
[1:21:13] Lord
[1:21:14] multitudes both of men and women in so
[1:21:17] much that they brought forth the
[1:21:19] sickened to the streets
[1:21:21] laid them on beds and couches that at
[1:21:24] the least the shadow of Peter passing by
[1:21:26] my over shadows some of them there came
[1:21:29] also a multitude out of the cities round
[1:21:31] about Jerusalem bringing sick folks and
[1:21:34] them that were vexed with unclean
[1:21:35] spirits and they were healed every one
[1:21:39] sans and wonders have been a part of the
[1:21:43] gospel since the inception they will be
[1:21:48] apart and are a part of the Church of
[1:21:50] the Living God anybody said we don't
[1:21:54] need the supernatural they've just put
[1:21:56] God out I look at what the preacher when
[1:22:00] you say you don't need the supernatural
[1:22:02] we need the supernatural we need to live
[1:22:07] in God coming down here brother it's
[1:22:09] more than just word wrath Paul would say
[1:22:12] our gospel came not in word only but it
[1:22:16] came in power and demonstration and much
[1:22:20] assurance it changed your life that's
[1:22:26] the promise of the word go you there for
[1:22:29] teaching all nations not lecturing them
[1:22:33] but preaching the gospel demonstrating
[1:22:36] the power of the Holy Ghost how can man
[1:22:39] do that man can't it's God accompanying
[1:22:43] his people you know what it is
[1:22:46] they were so one with God they didn't
[1:22:49] try to figure out how the word was gonna
[1:22:50] work they just knew it were
[1:22:52] they preach the word stood for the word
[1:22:55] and God came behind God brought the
[1:22:58] conviction God brought the healing God
[1:23:00] brought the deliverance God brought the
[1:23:02] feeling they had sense confidence of God
[1:23:05] backing them up but that word that they
[1:23:07] were speaking they were not taking any
[1:23:09] thought what they should say but they
[1:23:12] were yielded as vessels as mouthpiece
[1:23:14] unto God and the word was having the
[1:23:17] ride away
[1:23:18] these are apostles of God hallelujah
[1:23:29] you see God uses the supernatural as
[1:23:35] we've seen there in the book in the
[1:23:36] first part of the book of Acts you see
[1:23:38] it all through the Ministry of the Lord
[1:23:39] Jesus there never you don't find
[1:23:45] anywhere you read the Old Testament you
[1:23:47] never find such demonic manifestation
[1:23:50] as when the Ministry of the Son of Man
[1:23:53] is on earth you never find it but the
[1:23:58] Ministry of the son of man God come down
[1:24:01] and take upon a body of flesh devils
[1:24:05] start trembling Devils start crying out
[1:24:14] we've never been such a such a
[1:24:16] manifestation I tell ya for myself
[1:24:19] personally never seen so much I've been
[1:24:21] over the past few years
[1:24:23] youthful meeting after youth meeting
[1:24:25] after youthful meeting not just one or
[1:24:28] two multiple ones but in every one
[1:24:32] God has gotten a victory I said God has
[1:24:36] gone the victory where lives have been
[1:24:39] held held in bondage but yet God has
[1:24:42] come down by a word of authority that he
[1:24:45] has given us in this end time or glory
[1:24:48] be to God think of this Paul here he was
[1:24:52] the Bible and you see these things in
[1:24:56] the scripture here is Paul an apostle in
[1:24:58] her acts nineteen eight he went into the
[1:25:02] synagogue and he spake boldly for the
[1:25:05] space of three months disputing and
[1:25:07] persuading the things concerning the
[1:25:09] kingdom of God but when divers were
[1:25:12] hardened and believe not but speak evil
[1:25:14] of that way before the multitude he
[1:25:16] departed from them and separated the
[1:25:18] disciples disputing daily in the school
[1:25:20] of one fairness and this continued by
[1:25:23] the space of two years so that all they
[1:25:26] which dwelt in Asia heard the word of
[1:25:28] the Lord Jesus both Jews and Greeks and
[1:25:30] God rocked special miracles by the hands
[1:25:35] of Paul so that from his body were
[1:25:39] brought unto the sick handkerchief
[1:25:41] aprons and diseases departed from them
[1:25:43] and the evil spirits went out of them it
[1:25:45] was not a show
[1:25:49] signs and wonders as it accompanies the
[1:25:53] believers you find in the Ministry of
[1:25:56] the Apostles because here God would come
[1:25:59] special miracles
[1:26:02] a person could pray and pray and pray it
[1:26:05] ain't about how much you pray whether or
[1:26:06] not you do a miracle God is the one who
[1:26:09] uses you and they just say it has the
[1:26:12] scriptures we read there and that's five
[1:26:13] in other places
[1:26:14] God did did miracles by the hands of the
[1:26:17] Apostles it was God doing the work God
[1:26:21] in the body event if you're in the body
[1:26:25] then it's God working through the body
[1:26:26] and you're a part of the body
[1:26:32] now let me just try to take a little bit
[1:26:34] of a turn of a direction in Titus one
[1:26:39] one here is here is Paul and he is
[1:26:47] speaking to Titus now and notice I want
[1:26:52] you to notice these first words maja we
[1:26:55] could just preach on these for a while
[1:26:57] Paul a servant of God and an apostle of
[1:27:02] Jesus Christ according to the faith of
[1:27:06] God's elect and the acknowledging of the
[1:27:07] truth which is after godliness is very
[1:27:10] important he's a servant of God first
[1:27:12] then he's an apostle because in order to
[1:27:18] be a real apostle of God is got to be a
[1:27:20] real servant of God in order to be a
[1:27:23] real servant of God it takes a heart
[1:27:25] that's been humbled in his presence so
[1:27:27] so much that God Himself will come down
[1:27:29] and move into that life and that life
[1:27:32] wants only one desire and that's to
[1:27:34] serve the will of God the purpose of God
[1:27:36] that's how it is in every believers life
[1:27:39] isn't it it's first of all to be a
[1:27:41] servant to serve Him now Paul goes on in
[1:27:46] writes let me just kind of skip here in
[1:27:48] verse 4 to Titus my known son after the
[1:27:52] common faith grace mercy and peace from
[1:27:55] God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:27:58] our Savior for this cause left IV in
[1:28:03] Crete that thou should have sent in
[1:28:05] order the things that are wanting and
[1:28:08] ordain elders in every city as I had
[1:28:14] appointed thee
[1:28:15] so the representation we see the
[1:28:18] Apostles one who is sent taking a
[1:28:22] message sent from God now we find this
[1:28:29] with the Apostles that it's also those
[1:28:32] as brother Branham would put it in the
[1:28:34] message we find he said the Apostle is a
[1:28:37] special man
[1:28:38] he's a setter in order he's a man that
[1:28:41] sent from God to set the things in order
[1:28:47] you know order is a big thing to God the
[1:28:52] tabernacle had to be order in it
[1:28:54] you couldn't just put the furniture
[1:28:57] anywhere you wanted to put it
[1:28:59] you couldn't just do anything any way
[1:29:01] that you wanted to do it there is an
[1:29:04] order and you see when things are done
[1:29:08] in the right order it invites God is
[1:29:13] that right it invites God in the same
[1:29:16] way you know it's like when I walk in my
[1:29:17] house tonight you know trusting by the
[1:29:20] grace of God I'm gonna find it as I left
[1:29:22] it
[1:29:22] but if I wouldn't find that as I left it
[1:29:25] I ain't gonna walk into that house the
[1:29:26] same way I walk in there you know what's
[1:29:30] wrong here what's going on in here
[1:29:34] so you see it's got to be a house that
[1:29:38] said in order
[1:29:39] that'll welcome him it'll welcome him
[1:29:44] the same way let me just put it this
[1:29:45] simple so even if Peter were to walk
[1:29:48] through these doors tonight Peter could
[1:29:50] come here and said and say I feel at
[1:29:53] home
[1:29:54] brother Brandon could come in here and
[1:29:56] sit down he'd say I feel at home tonight
[1:29:58] Paul could come and sit out feel at home
[1:30:01] tonight
[1:30:03] now this is very important because God's
[1:30:08] presence comes when things are said in
[1:30:11] order this is why the scripture said
[1:30:14] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:30:17] Jesus Christ for the remission of your
[1:30:18] sins and you shall receive the gift of
[1:30:20] the Holy Ghost there's an order this is
[1:30:24] why there's an order then why even that
[1:30:27] as we come in we enter reverently into
[1:30:29] the house of God then even death with
[1:30:31] the singing in the music is to invite
[1:30:33] his presence every time before the word
[1:30:36] goes forth there what is it it's the
[1:30:39] music that goes ahead that prepares for
[1:30:42] the word to come there's an order God
[1:30:48] sees order that's very important
[1:30:51] now God is not one with the order it's
[1:30:55] an order by his word God is not one who
[1:30:59] sets order without divine love placing
[1:31:03] it God has he sets the order it's just
[1:31:07] like when you know Paul when there was
[1:31:10] that I witness of what was going on in
[1:31:14] the Church of Corinth and here they were
[1:31:16] coming in and taking communion and you
[1:31:18] know the story most of you they come in
[1:31:21] there and they're taking communion but
[1:31:23] they're coming and they're eaten they're
[1:31:26] not just taking a piece of the bread
[1:31:28] they're not just taking a drink of the
[1:31:31] wine but they're coming and eating and
[1:31:34] drinking just like they would during
[1:31:36] their pagan fest think of it
[1:31:40] and Paul lets him know he straightens it
[1:31:44] out
[1:31:44] you got houses to eat in Paul's an
[1:31:48] apostle he's setting him in order they
[1:31:50] got out of order he's setting it in
[1:31:51] order he's putting it in order why if
[1:31:56] you don't get it an honor he won't come
[1:31:58] to it you see this is where Elijah in
[1:32:02] order for the fire to fall he had to get
[1:32:06] the stones in order had to put the wood
[1:32:10] in order had to get the sacrifice in
[1:32:13] order oh how glorious it shows when a
[1:32:17] life is yielded and it's put in order by
[1:32:20] God the fire comes it'll come in a home
[1:32:24] it'll come in a life by the order of the
[1:32:27] world that's why the church has had to
[1:32:33] be put back in order by the Word of God
[1:32:37] in this generation for a rapture I've
[1:32:43] had to be put back upon Jesus now I want
[1:32:47] you to think of this here
[1:32:49] my this just keeps on unraveling acts
[1:32:55] 2:42 this is the testimony and they
[1:33:02] continued steadfastly in the Apostles
[1:33:06] doctrine and fellowship and in breaking
[1:33:10] of bread and in prayers where did the
[1:33:14] Apostles get their doctrine from the
[1:33:20] Apostle and prepend and him who is the
[1:33:23] chief of our faith the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:33:26] and he he was not these are not just
[1:33:29] things that were just coming up it was
[1:33:31] reached back from the old it was brought
[1:33:33] into the new
[1:33:35] this was not their thoughts that they
[1:33:37] went forward with it was the Apostles
[1:33:40] doctrine what they taught on water
[1:33:43] baptism they they taught on the Holy
[1:33:46] Ghost come on when they talked then it
[1:33:50] wasn't enough just to believe on you got
[1:33:52] it you've got to be born again are you
[1:33:55] with me they thought that you were
[1:33:57] chosen in Christ before the foundation
[1:33:59] world these are all part of the Apostles
[1:34:02] doctrine I want you to watch how this
[1:34:04] will how this would operate in acts
[1:34:06] 11:19 just give me just a few more
[1:34:09] moments is that okay now the Bible says
[1:34:13] in acts 11:19 when they were scattered
[1:34:16] abroad upon the persecution that arose
[1:34:19] about Stephen it traveled as far as
[1:34:22] Venus and Cyprus and Antioch preaching
[1:34:24] the word to none but only but unto the
[1:34:27] Jews only and some of them were men of
[1:34:30] cyprus and cyrene which when they were
[1:34:32] come to antioch spake unto the Grecians
[1:34:34] preaching the lord jesus and the hand of
[1:34:38] the lord was with them and a great
[1:34:40] number believed and turned unto the Lord
[1:34:43] then tidings of these things came unto
[1:34:47] the ears of the church which was in
[1:34:49] Jerusalem and they sent forth barnabas
[1:34:53] that he should go as far as antioch now
[1:34:57] these were converts that had already
[1:34:58] been warned
[1:35:01] but now news gets back to the church
[1:35:03] back in Jerusalem and they send out
[1:35:06] Barnabas this is why the Bible says no
[1:35:10] them that labor among you God uses every
[1:35:15] one of those men and those ministerial
[1:35:17] gifts and they all have a purpose so
[1:35:21] here is here is Barnabas he sent to the
[1:35:24] to the churches now notice who when he
[1:35:27] came had seen the grace of God was glad
[1:35:29] and exhorted them all that the purpose
[1:35:32] of heart they would cleave unto the Lord
[1:35:34] for he was a good man full of the Holy
[1:35:37] Ghost and a faith and much people was
[1:35:39] added unto the Lord then departed
[1:35:41] Barnabas to Tarsus for two seeks on
[1:35:45] Barnabas comes exhort some encourages
[1:35:49] them there being further established
[1:35:52] and then God moves upon his heart gets
[1:35:55] all up here
[1:35:56] gets all up here now you know Saul
[1:36:01] remember when Judas had went his way
[1:36:03] Judas was an apostle but he went his way
[1:36:05] right and before the Holy Ghost come you
[1:36:08] know they're never gonna choose somebody
[1:36:10] to fill in so they chose my thighs you
[1:36:13] don't ever read anything really about
[1:36:15] Matthias that God already had the one
[1:36:18] chosen honey with me God already knew
[1:36:21] where he was at I'm sure if he too made
[1:36:24] mention at that time and nobody would
[1:36:26] have believed it it just shows how God
[1:36:29] users want everybody else ain't no way
[1:36:31] and God took Paul to minister to us as
[1:36:36] Gentiles my God has a sense of humor
[1:36:42] and when he had found him he brought him
[1:36:46] unto Antioch and it came to pass that a
[1:36:48] whole year they assembled themselves
[1:36:50] with the church and taught much people
[1:36:52] and the disciples were called Christians
[1:36:55] first in Antioch
[1:37:00] order is important
[1:37:06] Paul would let him know you are a
[1:37:08] habitation of God by the spirit that is
[1:37:12] built upon the apostles and the prophets
[1:37:17] Jesus Christ Himself being the chief
[1:37:21] Cornerstone John an apostle was caught
[1:37:27] by the Spirit of God who was there on
[1:37:30] the Isle of Patmos he sees in
[1:37:33] Revelations 21 that heavenly Jerusalem
[1:37:38] and he sees the twelve gates names of
[1:37:44] the Apostles 12 foundations names of the
[1:37:47] apostles what is it it's founded not
[1:37:50] upon men but upon the working of the
[1:37:54] Holy Spirit that same original doctrine
[1:37:59] of the word which what is that same
[1:38:01] original doctrine Christ in you brings
[1:38:06] us in union with Christ Jesus where
[1:38:10] hearts have drifted away from the word
[1:38:12] don't you see why God had to send a
[1:38:14] message to us to get our hearts turned
[1:38:17] back in line to where hearts would be
[1:38:21] turned back to the faith of the
[1:38:23] Apostolic fathers that's the original
[1:38:27] foundation jesus said upon this rock
[1:38:33] I'll build my church and the gates of
[1:38:36] Hell shall not prevail against it well
[1:38:42] do we need the Apostles we do does God
[1:38:46] still have apostles he does he does
[1:38:51] and let me just say this not just those
[1:38:54] with a ministerial gift but I'm looking
[1:38:58] at here tonight lives that God has set
[1:39:03] free and loose from sin and he has sent
[1:39:08] you as a witness among your own family
[1:39:11] among your own job mates among your
[1:39:16] schoolmates
[1:39:19] one who is sent by God is a witness but
[1:39:25] there indeed he's the same yesterday
[1:39:29] today and forever it's a witness of his
[1:39:36] life in you what he did back there he's
[1:39:40] the same Jesus today same power same
[1:39:45] essence same nature I'm glad aren't you
[1:39:51] I'm glad let's pray Heavenly Father
[1:39:59] or Jesus
[1:40:03] there's a reason Lord there's a purpose
[1:40:05] Lord in everything
[1:40:10] Lord Jesus you're working in your word
[1:40:14] uncertain Lord they they worked under
[1:40:21] that burden in that hour as apostles we
[1:40:29] know Lord that there were evangelists
[1:40:31] that were present teachers as a matter
[1:40:35] of fact we know Lord God that a man can
[1:40:38] have more than one gift in his life you
[1:40:43] make that known Paul would say I'm a
[1:40:45] preacher I'm an apostle and I'm a
[1:40:49] teacher
[1:40:51] or Jesus
[1:40:54] it's you that does the calling the
[1:41:00] equipping and the sending forth
[1:41:06] 'lord one of the things that we find and
[1:41:08] we see here among the early church Lord
[1:41:10] when I've just looked at it and studied
[1:41:12] through many of the passages he never
[1:41:15] find where people were just operating as
[1:41:19] though independently on a whim or going
[1:41:22] here going there many times when there
[1:41:25] was a burden that came it was always
[1:41:28] brought before the church they would lay
[1:41:32] hands on pray fast seek the will of God
[1:41:38] or Jesus we realize the Lord each you're
[1:41:43] working in your body what you did in
[1:41:48] that early church you're the same God
[1:41:51] here this evening Lord you sent you send
[1:41:56] us a message Lord to call us out of
[1:41:59] Babylon to call us back to that original
[1:42:02] life that reality Lord God Lord bringing
[1:42:08] us back or God to where we're sent on
[1:42:11] the Apostles doctrine Lord not just to
[1:42:15] have doctrine and teaching but where's
[1:42:19] that same life that's working within
[1:42:21] it's Lord when it's real din our hearts
[1:42:23] Lord God it's the grace of God Lord it
[1:42:27] burns in our hearts every one of us Lord
[1:42:30] that's here Lord God when a life has
[1:42:34] been touched by you how can you not want
[1:42:37] to share it with somebody else how can
[1:42:41] you not want to share it Lord many times
[1:42:44] we realize it's not just something we
[1:42:48] just go erratically but God we must be
[1:42:52] led we must be led by you help us the
[1:42:58] Lord Jesus that our feet will be yielded
[1:43:01] to you the places that you would take us
[1:43:04] help us to wait on you if there's a word
[1:43:08] to be given help us to be sensitive we
[1:43:11] see how that you work Lord through the
[1:43:13] Apostles they're the men of God right
[1:43:15] there Lord in the early church they went
[1:43:18] where you send
[1:43:20] sometimes the Lord as we read about the
[1:43:22] persecutions they did not leave because
[1:43:24] it was something that Lord God of would
[1:43:27] be of a a joyous or a nice but
[1:43:29] persecution sometimes would cause them
[1:43:31] to be scattered they would be put in
[1:43:34] other places but wherever they went they
[1:43:38] would shine the light Oh God
[1:43:43] may our lives Lord may it shine that
[1:43:47] light that light of true Liberty Oh Lord
[1:43:54] God - where others Lord they would not
[1:43:56] see us but they see you then Lord it's
[1:44:00] you that they're attracted to in our
[1:44:02] lives it's the supernatural working of
[1:44:04] God not how well Lord that we could put
[1:44:07] the word together or not whether we know
[1:44:09] the Hebrew Greek or whatever the words
[1:44:11] aren't whether we know them or not
[1:44:13] it's to know you Lord Lord God were very
[1:44:18] much aware you can preach your word Lord
[1:44:22] lives themselves can Lord God be drawn
[1:44:25] the witness Lord how you can speak
[1:44:29] through many different lives hearts or
[1:44:33] God even as a mother Lord God among her
[1:44:36] children God her life being a witness
[1:44:40] and an expression of the resurrection of
[1:44:43] Jesus Christ or God as the fifth gospel
[1:44:48] she's a witness Lord o Lord God
[1:44:54] or Jesus I think about your prophet
[1:44:57] would talk about Susanna Wesley how then
[1:45:00] Lord God she would find time out of her
[1:45:01] busy day she would read and pray she did
[1:45:07] not know that out of that family would
[1:45:09] come a John and Charles Wesley she did
[1:45:12] not know that was in your hands but God
[1:45:16] is a parent there was an absolute that
[1:45:18] was in her life all that you required of
[1:45:22] her was hold that absolute over your
[1:45:25] children hold that absolute in your home
[1:45:31] Oh God granted granted tonight Lord what
[1:45:38] I pray father help us Lord as your
[1:45:41] children I'm no Lord tonight we want to
[1:45:44] join together I know that or God there's
[1:45:48] many missionaries apostles Lord
[1:45:53] different ones Lord God that are going
[1:45:55] out Lord even when Lord this virus has
[1:45:58] stopped much of the travel between
[1:46:00] nations but yet within these nations
[1:46:03] Lord God there's many of these brethren
[1:46:08] Lord God that go out I think of one of
[1:46:12] your great soldiers it's went on home to
[1:46:14] be with you brother Zephaniah Peters
[1:46:16] Lord God brothers F and I would go out
[1:46:19] among those in Tanzania they dwelt in
[1:46:24] caves Lord God they were people Lord all
[1:46:29] they knew many many heathen traits but
[1:46:34] God you had some children back there
[1:46:39] Brothers F&I would be one of many that
[1:46:42] would be used by you you would have come
[1:46:45] to hear God as you accompanied these
[1:46:47] apostles what a comfort it is to our
[1:46:50] lives you're the same God that
[1:46:53] accompanies a smart when we go to talk
[1:46:57] with that loved one we take the token
[1:46:59] with them so when we pray we present our
[1:47:02] token in prayer or Jesus if there's one
[1:47:06] here tonight Lord that doesn't know you
[1:47:10] that doesn't know you in that reality
[1:47:12] maybe they're listening by way of
[1:47:14] internet and that reality has not come
[1:47:17] into their heart where you've been
[1:47:20] seated in power and they've been raised
[1:47:25] in that newness of life Lord by the Holy
[1:47:30] Ghost Gordon may they not set or if
[1:47:33] there's one that's here or listening to
[1:47:35] my voice may they not settle may they
[1:47:37] realize the Lord it's not enough just to
[1:47:39] come to this church it's not enough it's
[1:47:43] not enough just to believe the messy
[1:47:44] it's not enough it's not enough just to
[1:47:50] believe and say well I believe that
[1:47:52] Jesus died for my sins but it's to
[1:47:55] become one with him it's to become one
[1:47:59] with him to be united with him in the
[1:48:04] power of his resurrection
[1:48:06] god help am i praying it's no doubt Lord
[1:48:10] God a question might be in their life
[1:48:12] how can I be made a lord in their heart
[1:48:15] allowed to be searched if they've not
[1:48:18] repented may they repent Lord if they've
[1:48:22] not been baptized in the name of the
[1:48:24] Lord Jesus Christ may they heat to that
[1:48:26] those are two things that you cannot do
[1:48:28] for them they must do but Lord the last
[1:48:32] one is something that only you can do
[1:48:34] and that's Lord God to give them the
[1:48:37] gift of the Holy Ghost that's the real
[1:48:42] reality Lord that's what their heart
[1:48:43] would be longing for granite tonight I
[1:48:46] pray father in the name of the Lord
[1:48:49] Jesus Christ amen
