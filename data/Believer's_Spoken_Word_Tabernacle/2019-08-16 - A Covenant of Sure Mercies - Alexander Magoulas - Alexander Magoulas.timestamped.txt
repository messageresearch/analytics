[9:31] little bit of coffee that's okay I think
[9:35] praise the Lord we sure appreciate you
[9:42] all we want to greet you in the name of
[9:44] the Lord Jesus Christ and you know I was
[9:47] at the youth camp there was rather
[9:48] browning a few weeks ago gotta see him
[9:50] minister the morning and I know he's not
[9:52] here so I can get away with give him a
[9:54] rose but but just what a tremendous
[9:55] ministry and job and we just you know I
[9:58] just really appreciate his burden for
[10:00] the young people in his ministry and I
[10:02] can get behind something like that and I
[10:04] hope you all can too I feel like that's
[10:06] what we're all about here since a common
[10:10] spirit amen so how good and how pleasant
[10:13] it is for brethren to dwell together in
[10:15] unity well praise the Lord I get to talk
[10:17] like this I'll just have you on your
[10:18] feet all 45 minutes and you'll be like
[10:21] man we've been staying for 45 minutes
[10:22] you know like I'm gonna have to anyway
[10:25] or longer
[10:27] so if you have your Bibles this morning
[10:29] I won't I will try to keep you on your
[10:31] feet too much longer but we're going to
[10:32] turn to the Book of Isaiah the 55th
[10:35] chapter and I was looking to maybe go a
[10:38] different direction with the service and
[10:41] I was praying this scripture came to me
[10:42] and I was trying to figure what this is
[10:44] about and I forgot I didn't do this on
[10:48] purpose but the last time
[10:50] ministered here I believe I took this
[10:52] very same scripture and it's a different
[10:55] text I'm not preaching the same sermon
[10:56] everybody shut down on me now so I was
[10:59] gonna preach the same one it's actually
[11:00] a different sermon I think I mentioned
[11:02] that there's a whole nother thought here
[11:04] and so I didn't realize that I'm like oh
[11:06] praise the Lord I was looking this
[11:07] morning what I preached last time that's
[11:09] what that's about so we're gonna take
[11:12] this same scripture but I have a
[11:13] different thought this morning and we
[11:15] just pray the Lord blessed T and the
[11:17] Holy Spirit take it out to the people
[11:18] Isaiah the 55th chapter here and the
[11:22] scripture says in the first verse it
[11:24] says hello everyone that thirst if come
[11:26] you to the waters and he that hath no
[11:29] money come he buy and eat yay come buy
[11:32] wine and milk without money and without
[11:35] prize wherefore do you spend money for
[11:38] that which is not bread and your labor
[11:40] for that which satisfies not hearken
[11:43] diligently unto me an ET that which is
[11:46] good and let your soul delight itself in
[11:49] fatness incline your ear and come unto
[11:53] me here and your soul shall live and I
[11:57] will make an everlasting covenant with
[11:59] you even the sure mercies of David
[12:01] behold I have given him for a witness to
[12:04] the people a leader and a commander to
[12:06] the people now last time we talked about
[12:08] the character of David as a leader this
[12:10] fourth verse but I want to come back
[12:11] here this third verse and tie it in this
[12:13] morning read it once more
[12:14] it says incline your ear and come unto
[12:18] me here and your soul shall live and I
[12:20] will make an everlasting covenant with
[12:22] you even the sure mercies of David I
[12:26] like to take that as a thought a
[12:27] covenant of sure mercies but before I
[12:30] before we Minister this morning I just
[12:32] want to go ahead and bow our heads for a
[12:33] word of Prayer and look to the author of
[12:36] this scripture our gracious Heavenly
[12:39] Father it was you that exhorted us just
[12:42] now in this scripture to incline our
[12:44] ears to you to hear and our souls would
[12:47] live father many people they they've
[12:50] studied this Bible perhaps and maybe
[12:52] they've even heard the word of God maybe
[12:54] they've sat in church for years but what
[12:56] we want to Incline we want to lean
[12:57] towards that word right now I believe
[12:59] whichever way the tree leans is the way
[13:01] the tree falls and so Lord we just want
[13:03] plying ourselves right now to hearken
[13:06] diligently as the scripture says to
[13:08] hearken diligently unto your word lord
[13:10] may we not be slothful but diligent of
[13:13] those who are partakers by faith and
[13:16] patience partaking the promises Lord we
[13:18] want that kind of a testimony this
[13:20] morning we want to be the one that we
[13:22] could that you can look at say that is
[13:24] my my son or daughter that is hearken
[13:26] diligently unto my voice
[13:28] father I pray you just take this word
[13:30] which has been read now be enlightener I
[13:32] hate his father and give understanding
[13:34] to us Lord may it be so sweet in our my
[13:37] own father even though it be bitter in
[13:38] the belly may be sweeten our mouth and
[13:40] enlighten our eyes even there's that
[13:41] honey enlighten to Jonathan's eyes when
[13:44] an army was an hungered Lord pray you to
[13:46] come and satisfy our hungry souls give
[13:48] us that drink that that we would never
[13:50] thirst again Lord if there be one here
[13:52] today Lord that don't know you that way
[13:54] if there be one here today Lord that
[13:56] sinned against your father each of us
[13:58] Lord we're having a need this morning
[13:59] Lord just forgive us where we've sinned
[14:01] where we've let you down Lord we we back
[14:03] son maybe a thousand times a day we we
[14:05] need your grace we need to come to sure
[14:08] mercies Oh mercies that don't waver or
[14:11] falter but we need your mercy today just
[14:14] as much if not more than we've ever
[14:15] needed it before father

[14:20] strengthen establish and settle your
[14:23] people this morning may you bless them I
[14:25] pray father know what said and done and
[14:28] he received great glory and honor on
[14:29] this and do that which only you can do
[14:31] we pray for we ask it in the mighty name
[14:33] of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and
[14:36] the bride says Amen god bless yous
[14:39] you're seated amen praise the Lord a
[14:44] covenant of short mercies as a thought
[14:47] this morning when the Apostle Paul and
[14:49] his company there they're going about on
[14:51] a missionary trip there and they they
[14:53] depart from purga you can read about in
[14:56] the book of Acts the thirteenth chapter
[14:57] and I'm just going to read to you here
[14:58] in a moment but they they depart from
[15:00] purga and they return to Antioch and the
[15:02] Apostle Paul he begins to minister in a
[15:03] synagogue there and he says this in acts
[15:06] 13 and the 17th verses says the god of
[15:09] this people of Israel chose our fathers
[15:11] and exalted the people when they dwelt
[15:14] as strangers in the land of Egypt
[15:16] and with an hi arm brought he them out
[15:19] of it and about the time of 40 years
[15:21] suffered he their manners nice people
[15:23] say God don't care about whether he got
[15:24] manners or not but he suffered their
[15:26] manners they meant well I just thought
[15:28] I'd drop it in there quick amen listen
[15:31] everything God did for them they
[15:32] complained about who they complained
[15:34] about to Moses complain to each other
[15:36] they murmur and complain they mad you
[15:38] say what's that got to do with me we got
[15:40] to be careful we don't murmur and
[15:41] complain against each other man cuz how
[15:44] you treat each others how you treat the
[15:45] Lord so he suffered their manners their
[15:48] bad manners is all right forty years he
[15:51] suffered there man pretty good though
[15:55] suffered healer managed in the
[15:57] wilderness and when he had destroyed
[15:58] seven nations in the line of canaan he
[16:01] divided their land to them by a lot and
[16:04] after that he came unto them he gave
[16:06] unto them judges about the space of four
[16:09] hundred and fifty years until samuel the
[16:11] prophet and afterward they desired a
[16:15] king and God gave unto them saw the son
[16:18] of Kish a man of this tribe of Benjamin
[16:20] by the space of forty years and when he
[16:23] had removed him he raised up unto them
[16:26] David to be their king to whom also he
[16:29] gave testimony and said I like this
[16:31] testimony I want this kind of testimony
[16:33] he gave testimony of testimony and said
[16:37] I have found David the son of Jesse a
[16:40] man after my own heart which shall
[16:43] fulfill all my will of this man's seed
[16:47] of God according to his promise raised
[16:50] unto Israel a savior Jesus now I'm just
[16:53] gonna skip down for the sake of time the
[16:54] thirty third verse thirty third verse
[16:56] says God hath fulfilled the same unto us
[17:00] their children and that he hath raised
[17:02] up Jesus again as it is also written in
[17:06] the second Psalm thou art my son this
[17:08] day have I begotten thee and as
[17:12] concerning that he raised him up from
[17:14] the dead now no more to return to
[17:16] corruption in other words the evidence
[17:18] or the proof of this that he doesn't
[17:21] return to corruption he said on this
[17:23] wise I will give you the sure mercies of
[17:27] David what we read in our opening tax
[17:28] amen so God has made
[17:30] promised that David would have a
[17:32] covenant or make it he would make a
[17:34] covenant of sure mercies is an
[17:35] everlasting covenant amen and he's gonna
[17:38] give this to David now I want you to
[17:39] think about this and I'm gonna take the
[17:40] stop for just a few moments here because
[17:42] David had been anointed by the prophet
[17:45] Samuel to become the king of is our from
[17:47] the time he'd been just a teenager hey
[17:49] man he's just a young man brother BAM
[17:50] says maybe 14 years old and so this
[17:53] young man he's anointed in the midst of
[17:55] his brother to become the next king but
[17:58] he does not inherit the throne
[17:59] automatically or instantly amen but this
[18:02] boy and then later a man that's gonna
[18:04] one day become king he spent many years
[18:09] as a ragtag been to Gentile warriors he
[18:13] trains them they're the best of the best
[18:15] and he's he's slaying lines now they're
[18:17] slaying lines he's slaying Giants
[18:18] they're slaying Giants amen they they
[18:21] come under him and but I want you
[18:22] understand that he and his men they
[18:23] wanted his vagabonds four years raiding
[18:26] the camps of the enemy raiding the
[18:27] Philistines from day to day why because
[18:30] King Saul was out to kill David amen to
[18:35] be a king look like a king for quite a
[18:38] spell a man actually looked like a
[18:40] fugitive a renegade er an outcast and I
[18:43] want you to see that David had fought
[18:44] for Saul
[18:45] amen he'd come and played music for me
[18:48] taking an evil spirit off and then he
[18:50] was tormented by evil spirits he'd been
[18:52] a friend to his son Jonathan amen the
[18:55] Bible says their souls were knit
[18:56] together the love that they had between
[18:57] was so great he'd been a friend to his
[18:59] son he'd fought his battles for him
[19:02] he played his music David had been
[19:04] faithful in every way now I want you to
[19:07] catch this now David had not tried to
[19:09] take anything from saw he wasn't trying
[19:12] to promote himself he'd been faithful he
[19:14] stood behind Saul in every way possibly
[19:16] man and yet when he and yeah at the end
[19:20] of it all Saul's looking to take his
[19:21] life hey man he done every kindness to
[19:24] him and been kind to him and he repaid
[19:26] him with trying to take his life you
[19:27] were painting with a spirit of murder
[19:29] and when Saul couldn't kill him on his
[19:30] own he got his whole church amen
[19:33] you got a whole arm he said we're gonna
[19:34] go after this guy and we're gonna run
[19:36] down cuz he's trying to now I want you
[19:39] notice he's got the whole army going
[19:40] after David he's on the run and he
[19:43] fusion and yet David encounters them a
[19:45] man you're familiar with this
[19:46] David encounters him in the Lotus in a
[19:48] cave one night and david has an
[19:50] opportunity he has an opportunity just
[19:55] slay this man saw and yet he doesn't
[19:57] take it because he understands that the
[19:59] same God that anointed him to be a king
[20:01] I know did this man and I was not for
[20:04] David to remove him brother Ram says
[20:06] this and respects he says if you can't
[20:07] respect the man respect the office he
[20:10] holds in God that's exactly right so you
[20:12] respect him if a minister comes up your
[20:14] pastor always respect him he said I've
[20:18] heard congregations talk about their
[20:19] pastor just how they talk about him
[20:21] running down ridicule him how is that
[20:24] pasture ever gonna do anything for you
[20:26] what he says he can't do it you don't he
[20:30] says I don't say this Church and I'm not
[20:31] saying this church either he says I
[20:33] don't say this Church but I mean
[20:34] churches I have seen he says you've got
[20:37] to love your pastor you've got to know
[20:40] he's a human being well yet God has made
[20:42] him the pastor the Holy Spirit has made
[20:45] him the overseer then you've got to
[20:47] respect him in that manner and no matter
[20:49] what the pastor's done oh my he said we
[20:54] need to shake my hand no matter what the
[20:55] pastor's done if you respect him in your
[20:59] heart as God's ever God will respect you
[21:02] now notice he's not saying if he does
[21:03] the right thing but even if he does the
[21:05] wrong thing if you respect him God will
[21:08] respect you for that
[21:09] hey man praise the Lord that's true
[21:12] listen I said this one time I was
[21:14] preaching somewhere I said sometimes God
[21:16] well let your pastor may be able to note
[21:18] your pastor to say or do a certain they
[21:20] doesn't have to be a pastor could be a
[21:21] minister whoever may be a deacon but
[21:23] he'll anoint that man or he'll allow
[21:25] them to say or do something just a
[21:26] little contrary to what you think and
[21:29] sometimes God will allow that cuz he's
[21:30] wanting to see how you're gonna react
[21:32] you know puffed up and say well I got
[21:34] rights oh I know better than him
[21:36] or can you respect that man's office and
[21:38] then because God is not looking to see
[21:40] how much smarter d-do you are than the
[21:42] next guy a matter how much were
[21:44] qualified you are he's wanted to see how
[21:46] you respond to Authority amen hey man
[21:50] praise the Lord it's like I was talking
[21:52] about here I was really young you read
[21:55] the Book of Jeremiah
[21:56] in the 35th chapter the Prophet Jeremiah
[21:59] he goes to the sons are at Kabul when
[22:01] he's at the with the sons of her cob God
[22:03] tells him I won't you sit down and offer
[22:05] these guys wine to drink so the Prophet
[22:07] Jeremiah offers them wine to drink out
[22:09] of these cups and they said not so we
[22:11] won't do this he said we've not drank
[22:12] wine
[22:13] since our forefather Rick hop command
[22:15] it's not to do this we've knocked one of
[22:17] the houses but we wandered in tents
[22:19] because our grandfather commanded us to
[22:21] do this and God says I want you to look
[22:23] at this I've spoken to my children day
[22:25] and night and they've not hearken unto
[22:28] me but these men they pursue their
[22:30] natural father
[22:31] I mean God blessed them with an
[22:34] everlasting lineage because they had
[22:36] respect for that man Amen praise the
[22:39] Lord
[22:39] so I want you to notice this because
[22:41] they respected that man listen it wasn't
[22:44] that necessarily what they were doing
[22:45] was right or wrong but their daddy gave
[22:47] him a command and they had enough
[22:48] respect for that man as their father
[22:50] that God blessed him a man prays alone
[22:53] see listen it's like this is where I'm
[22:55] coming to King Saul he had a position
[22:57] and he was alright with having Authority
[23:00] but when the prophet Samuel comes to him
[23:02] hey man the man that anointed him to be
[23:05] king the man that legitimize his claim
[23:08] as a king that anointed him when that
[23:10] man comes in with an ordinance from the
[23:12] Lord he didn't respect that man's
[23:13] Authority he didn't respect the words
[23:15] the Lord came to him he men and so what
[23:18] happens he makes himself Ian but I want
[23:30] you understand the very profit
[23:31] legitimate him he's he's hot on a said
[23:34] he is made of disobedient to the word by
[23:37] that prophet and in doing so he made
[23:39] himself the enemy of God and then what
[23:42] would it be today if I come up here and
[23:43] I preached this message and I claimed to
[23:45] believe this message and I'm criticizing
[23:47] the Prophet well he did this wrong and
[23:49] he did that wrong and he said this and
[23:51] I'm up here doing that I'm actually
[23:53] destroying my own authority
[23:54] I'm undermining my own ministry man then
[23:57] if studium preached what this message
[23:59] has done in their life and they make
[24:00] great claim they come out and say well
[24:02] there's nothing to it and a prophet me
[24:04] mistakes and a prophet this and a
[24:05] prophet that where does that leave them
[24:09] hey man see they've actually undermined
[24:11] the very thing that God give them hey
[24:13] man
[24:15] praise the Lord it doesn't do us any
[24:17] good to go around tell people that we
[24:19] believe on the authority of Scripture
[24:20] we're not gonna obey the word ourselves
[24:22] hey man listen we can't tell our
[24:25] children you respect others respect the
[24:27] authority if we won't do it ourselves
[24:30] hey man we're Tehran and model
[24:33] disrespect towards other people we say
[24:35] we believe in a fivefold ministry but we
[24:36] won't sit under a pastor hey man when we
[24:40] torch them they go to church but we
[24:41] don't go with him brother Branson a sin
[24:43] hey man he says it's absolutely a sin
[24:46] not what he said he said it's a sin to
[24:48] send your children son in school go with
[24:51] them and then listen well we all want
[24:54] our kids to go to church but people
[24:55] don't want to go to church themselves
[24:57] and then they wonder why the kids don't
[24:58] go hey man listen you've got to you've
[25:01] got to show you believe this thing
[25:02] because what happens after a while
[25:04] people looking saying you don't believe
[25:06] this if you don't respect this word
[25:08] why would I respect what you have to say
[25:10] about it he gives an example he said he
[25:19] was reading a little editorial cartoon
[25:20] one day and he said there's this this
[25:23] dad he'd been up drinking the night
[25:24] before and he's passed out Sunday
[25:26] morning with all these beer cans laying
[25:28] around him and the son he's got a little
[25:30] nine-year-old boy I think it was or
[25:32] whatever come up and he was just up for
[25:34] church got all cleaned up said who's
[25:35] gonna take me to church who's gonna take
[25:38] me to Sunday school and here that
[25:40] daddy's passed out with all these cans
[25:42] on them now we probably don't have a lot
[25:44] of believers with a bunch of beer cans
[25:45] around but we've got other kinds of cans
[25:46] hey man that keep us from serving God
[25:49] well listen we can go to the ballgame we
[25:52] can go to work and we can show up on
[25:53] time for work and then we can watch the
[25:56] movie or stare at a video game or do
[25:57] whatever for hours but we can't seem to
[25:59] make you to church amen we can't seem to
[26:02] find time to pray like you used to
[26:04] we can't seem to find time to serve the
[26:06] Lord or read our Bibles listen if you
[26:08] can do all those things you can find
[26:09] time to serve God I mean if you got
[26:13] breath in your body to complain and
[26:14] murmur and fuss and fight you've got
[26:16] breath in your body to praise God you've
[26:19] got breath in your body to confess the
[26:20] word
[26:21] hey man praise the Lord
[26:24] some money here's daddy passed out all
[26:27] these cans around he can do this and he
[26:29] can do that he can do this but he can't
[26:31] serve God amen like I said if we're not
[26:35] serious about the word why would
[26:37] somebody take you seriously about it
[26:38] amen I mean think about this even Saul's
[26:41] son Jonathan amen
[26:43] I was just talking about when I was
[26:44] praying but even Saul's son Jonathan he
[26:47] comes back and he finds some honey and
[26:48] he begins to eat this honey and they
[26:50] said you don't know you don't know the
[26:51] Kings give it a commandment the Kings
[26:53] made a commandment you're not supposed
[26:54] to eat we're on a fast right now and
[26:57] watch what Jonathan says about his own
[26:59] daddy he says that he's the one that's
[27:01] hurt the land he's almost done toys in
[27:03] my father's trouble the land look at my
[27:05] eyes how they're enlightened by this
[27:06] little bit of honey he says and how much
[27:08] more if the people could eat freely of
[27:11] the spoil see he's even lost respect for
[27:13] his own daddy now who's the king amen
[27:15] now listen Jonathan's a good man he's a
[27:17] godly man he was a real friend of David
[27:19] but he perished with Saul and that
[27:22] battle is that right why because the
[27:24] Bible said if you honor your father and
[27:26] your mother your days will be long on
[27:28] the earth amen so listen even though
[27:30] what he said was right he was wrong and
[27:32] saying it because that man had an office
[27:34] got it annoying that man to be a king
[27:36] but David the scripture tells us he
[27:38] behaved himself wisely hey man that's
[27:41] what we not to do is that right when we
[27:43] have a disagreement with somebody or
[27:45] maybe we just don't see eye to eye or
[27:46] maybe we got questions about the word
[27:48] even or whatever it is we ought to
[27:49] behave ourselves wisely and many David
[27:52] behave himself wisely in the presence
[27:54] all to where Saul himself recognized it
[27:57] hey man praise the Lord
[28:00] I listen I'm coming doesn't mean David
[28:05] has to be one Amen because he respects
[28:08] the office the scripture tells us four
[28:10] times like I said that he behaved
[28:12] himself
[28:20] but listen this is a so David he's
[28:22] running from Saul because he knows he's
[28:24] gonna be a king one day but yet there's
[28:26] a song on his way and I wonder how many
[28:28] times how many times are we like David
[28:30] maybe they was laying out there in the
[28:31] stunts of the stars one night and he
[28:33] began to wonder to himself what am I
[28:35] gonna be a king have I made a mistake
[28:37] somewhere how about let God down hey man
[28:41] listen it wasn't a day or a week but
[28:43] years past been anointed he knew even
[28:47] called and yet he's sitting there
[28:49] waiting for it to come to pass this he's
[28:51] got a man chase him trying to hunt him
[28:53] down amen don't want no doubt many times
[28:58] he begin to question within himself
[29:00] have I missed something that I missed
[29:01] the calling of God did I make a mistake
[29:04] somewhere
[29:05] God really speak to me hey man
[29:09] you ever gotta have to God show you
[29:11] something and there's a salat comes
[29:12] anyway listen Saul got in David's way
[29:14] listen it wasn't because David was a
[29:16] threat to the kingdom of Israel it
[29:19] wasn't because David was a bad man is
[29:20] because Saul was jealous of David that's
[29:23] why he was in his way amen
[29:24] unless is sometimes the spirit of rise
[29:26] up and come against you but listen just
[29:29] because Saul coming against you doesn't
[29:31] change the fact that you're called to be
[29:32] a king you're called to be a priest
[29:34] let's call you in the purpose hey man
[29:41] listen saw this he was tormented by an
[29:46] evil spirit a man it played on his
[29:48] vanity it played on his insecurities and
[29:51] it played on his pride not because he
[29:53] was going to make him say he had already
[29:55] failed as a king he'd already made
[29:57] himself the enemy of God and that's why
[29:59] he finds himself in this position amen
[30:02] so he should have stepped down he should
[30:04] have moved out of the way and let David
[30:06] fight let David take over but his pride
[30:08] wouldn't let him and his insecurities
[30:11] wouldn't let him we've got to be careful
[30:14] that we're not trying to get in
[30:15] somebody's way just because we think we
[30:17] could do it better we've got a better
[30:19] idea about it but we've got to
[30:20] acknowledge what God has done
[30:22] amen praise the Lord amen
[30:29] listen we fight so hard sometimes to
[30:32] destroy our enemies you don't have to
[30:33] defeat anybody hey man listen your
[30:37] enemies already defeated Satan he's
[30:42] defeated but this is your biggest enemy
[30:44] today's this flesh you're walking around
[30:45] in if you can never get mastery over
[30:48] this guy it doesn't matter how many
[30:49] souls rise up it doesn't matter how many
[30:51] Philistines rise up you've got the
[30:54] mastery over you've been called to be a
[30:56] victorious King you've been called to be
[30:59] a priest and then it's not your job to
[31:03] worry about what your calling you
[31:04] through this card you you work out your
[31:06] own calling you work out your own
[31:08] salvation with fear and trembling Amen
[31:11] listen David who wanted he'd been a man
[31:13] of war the Bible says he'd been a man of
[31:15] war for years he'd become accustomed to
[31:17] it from the time he was a little boy he
[31:19] flasks your life he's wandering around
[31:21] he's fighting in the desert fighting
[31:23] enemies hey man and finally saw parishes
[31:27] listen he didn't have to kill so so I
[31:29] pushed because he was the enemy of God
[31:31] God took him off the scene he took
[31:33] Jonathan off the scene and Dave becomes
[31:35] a king hey man and he rises up and he
[31:38] who finds his position a man hopefully
[31:42] we got some sons and daughters of God
[31:43] here that found their position hey man
[31:45] hopefully it's not just something you're
[31:47] looking for hopefully you know what
[31:48] you're called to do
[31:49] amen praise the Lord
[31:53] now listen heaping they were accustomed
[31:55] to honoring he'd been used to fleeing he
[31:58] dwelt in tents he'd lived in caves but
[32:00] he finally he becomes a king and
[32:02] something remarkable happens during the
[32:04] time he's a king Israel finds peace from
[32:06] and rest from all its enemies
[32:09] amen hey man praise the Lord listen
[32:12] they've got so much in his life I think
[32:17] that's pretty good I believe in making
[32:19] so completely serve God till the devil
[32:21] don't know what to do with him you know
[32:24] it seemed like some Christians are I'm
[32:25] not picking how a man but seems like
[32:27] some Christians they're always just
[32:28] getting beat up and they're always just
[32:30] fussing and they're always just toiling
[32:32] there they're wonderful gonna have rest
[32:34] they're ever gonna have peace we're
[32:36] gonna get victory but listen the Bible
[32:38] says he's giving us a rest
[32:39] he's giving us our victory this is our
[32:41] victory that overcomes the world even
[32:44] our faith I meant to make Christians
[32:47] trying to find victory he's got the
[32:51] victory hey man they're waiting for
[32:53] power you got power
[32:59] fugitives your kings your queens we're
[33:08] not waiting for victories victories now
[33:11] if you can't get victory today wouldn't

[33:17] gonna start getting victory I'm
[33:19] preaching to somebody now somebody
[33:21] getting quiet amen you ought to get a
[33:22] shout there'll be a shot of the king in
[33:25] the camp he got victory there ought to
[33:28] be a shot not a bunch of rebel ready

[33:34] the enemy in the camp we let out a war

[33:54] untouchable as long as he had a promise
[33:57] that he was going to be a king that
[33:59] devil couldn't come near him I wonder
[34:01] how many Spears whizzed around his head
[34:03] that were thrown at him just like we saw
[34:05] through that job and how many arrows
[34:07] passed by him you're looking at man like
[34:10] George Washington but I'm preaching

[51:21] all these years since the time of Moses
[51:24] he's wandering around the tent like I

[51:30] something big is the stern side he wants
[51:32] to build a house for the Lord
[51:36] he says you know what there's something
[51:38] in me now listen Moses didn't tell him
[51:40] to build a house for the Lord amen

[52:03] Solomon build me a house hey man praise
[52:07] the Lord I'm gonna let him do me huh

[52:11] he he actually has a greater glory or a
[52:13] greater habitation I'm coming to hear
[52:15] just a little bit a man but he says you
[52:17] know what I never told you here sweetie
[52:19] is what he says he says I've never told
[52:21] you I want a house but I want one I've
[52:25] been house shopping for years looking
[52:28] for the right kind of habitation and
[52:30] here's a man by the name of David and
[52:32] there's something in his heart says I
[52:33] want to build a house for the Lord hey
[52:35] man
[52:37] the scripture says this in 2nd Samuel 7
[52:40] 11 and I since the time that I committed
[52:42] judges to be over my people Israel and
[52:44] if caused the arrest of all I am he's
[52:46] also the Lord tell thee he will make the
[52:48] in house and when that day's be
[52:50] fulfilled and thou shalt sleep with my
[52:52] father's I will set up thy seed after
[52:54] thee which shall proceed out of thy
[52:56] bowels and I will establish his kingdom
[52:58] he shall build a house for now my name
[53:01] and I will establish the throne of his
[53:03] kingdom forever amen
[53:07] go down to verse 16 again ah the the
[53:11] house and my kingdom shall be
[53:12] established forever before thee thy
[53:14] throne shall be established forever so
[53:17] God is making a covenant we read about
[53:19] in the opening scripture he's making a
[53:20] covenant with this man and this is the
[53:22] Covenant that he hasn't he's not made a
[53:24] covenant like this since the time of
[53:27] Abraham amen he doesn't say well if
[53:30] David does this I'll do this and if he
[53:31] doesn't do this I'll do this but he's
[53:33] making an everlasting unconditional
[53:36] covenant with him he said because there
[53:38] was a desire in your heart
[53:41] oh ma no because there's a desire in
[53:44] your heart to build a house for me
[53:46] therefore I'll let you see do it
[53:48] therefore I will establish my covenant
[53:51] with you forever
[53:54] because of that desire amen
[53:57] praise the Lord listen this is this is
[54:00] why this is so special because he's a
[54:01] man after God's own heart now listen
[54:03] what makes him a man after God's own
[54:05] heart many examples we could seem like
[54:08] David saying we could pray like David
[54:10] pray we could dance like David dance you
[54:12] know David could repent he could humble
[54:14] himself he could listen to God he could
[54:16] be contrite I mean he was a shepherd
[54:19] over sheep he loved his sheep there's so
[54:21] many things about being his life we
[54:22] could look at say that's a man after
[54:24] God's own heart but there's something in
[54:27] particular that was in his heart that
[54:28] God said I'm gonna make a covenant with
[54:30] you amen the Bible tells you in first
[54:32] Kings a Solomon speaker says it was in
[54:35] the heart of David my father to build a
[54:38] house for the name of the Lord God of
[54:40] Israel and the Lord said unto David my
[54:43] father whereas it was in your heart to
[54:46] build a house into my name thou did us
[54:48] well that it was in thine heart other
[54:49] words this is the thing the desire in
[54:52] his life to build a house for God that
[54:54] was the thing they said that's why I'm
[54:56] gonna make a covenant with you amen
[54:58] David said one thing have I desired it
[55:01] wasn't a bigger house or Lamborghini it
[55:05] was a better paying job one thing if I
[55:07] desired of the Lord that will I seek
[55:09] after that I may dwell in the house of
[55:12] the Lord all the days of my life to
[55:15] behold the beauty of the Lord and to
[55:17] enquire in his temple listen that's what
[55:22] was in David's heart a desire for the
[55:23] house of God I hope I hope I'm talking
[55:27] to some people they got the same kind of
[55:28] desire Eman listen this house God was
[55:32] gonna make sure this house was
[55:33] established listen he gives so much
[55:35] wealth and so much power to Solomon you
[55:38] look in the Integrity's it was the
[55:40] greatest Kingdom the wealthiest King had
[55:42] ever been in the ancient times why
[55:46] no praise of Lord you don't have to
[55:48] actually answer that but I'm going to
[55:51] why did God prosper Solomon why didn't
[55:53] give him so much wealth why didn't give
[55:55] him such a great Kingdom to build an
[55:57] house for his name cuz he promised David
[55:59] he would do it listen he wasn't wealthy
[56:02] just to be wealthy
[56:03] he wasn't blessed just to be blessed
[56:05] listen if God has blessed you with
[56:07] something maybe it's money maybe it's a
[56:09] gift
[56:09] maybe you can sing whatever God is
[56:11] giving you God has blessed you with
[56:12] something for a reason it's not for you
[56:15] to sit on it or to pride yourself on it
[56:17] but it's to use it for the purpose of
[56:19] God's house amen if God gives you
[56:26] something in your life it's for his
[56:28] purpose it's for his house hey man he
[56:32] bless Solomon for David's sake because
[56:35] he made a promise to David amen
[56:37] listen Solomon is a king he had 300
[56:40] wives I think senator concubines and he
[56:42] backs at the end of his life and yet God
[56:44] preserved his kingdom
[56:46] why because he made a promise to David
[56:49] listen maybe you got lost loved ones
[56:51] this one maybe you got a child that's
[56:53] wayward in the world or something and
[56:54] you think maybe there's no hope I want
[56:56] you to understand him there was hope not
[56:58] just for David's child but for his great
[57:00] great great grandchildren listen miss a
[57:06] man by the name of Hezekiah in the Bible
[57:08] this man God says the prophet Isaiah
[57:11] some wonder you know this story
[57:13] he says the prophet Isaiah have an Isis
[57:15] set your house in order for you're gonna
[57:17] die and Hezekiah he turns his face
[57:21] toward the wall and he begins to cry he
[57:24] says Lord would you have mercy on me
[57:26] would you spare my life now listen this
[57:30] prophet is giving a prophecy and he's
[57:32] walking out the house he says why done
[57:34] my job

[57:58] you 15 years because of thy father David
[58:03] is our Isis for thy father David's sake
[58:06] I'll do this because Hezekiah prayed the
[58:10] right kind of prayer it wasn't cause he
[58:12] just hung himself God made a promise
[58:13] [Music]
[58:16] whatever god had mercy for him because
[58:21] of one man's zeal one man's desire one

[1:04:30] prayer over this temple we're gonna
[1:04:33] dedicate to a special purpose Lord when
[1:04:35] your people are afflicted and they are
[1:04:38] in bondage and there's strangers in the
[1:04:40] far-off land they can lift up their eyes
[1:04:43] and look toward this temple
[1:04:47] we're God dwells they can look in the
[1:04:50] right direction and praying God will
[1:04:52] deliver them when these people when a
[1:04:58] pestilence comes on them and then find
[1:05:00] themselves smitten with cygnus they can
[1:05:02] look toward this temple sacrifices
[1:05:12] remain dedication to taking place you

[1:05:19] could be on the the backside the
[1:05:21] backside stranded somewhere the flat

[1:05:26] toward that temple and by utter his name
[1:05:29] if you just move your lips and faith he
[1:05:32] would hear you and deliver you hey man

[1:05:44] longer just something with David it had
[1:05:46] moved into his seed it had moved in his
[1:05:48] children
[1:05:48] it was now in a building he made a hops
[1:05:52] and the same verse that David had if you
[1:05:55] just looked toward this house that David
[1:05:57] one to Bill you pray toward this house
[1:06:00] God would gives you the same mercy and
[1:06:07] it's funny how we read the Bible these
[1:06:09] great men of faith these great women in
[1:06:12] the Bible that's a nobodies like you and
[1:06:15] I
[1:06:19] you think Noah was smarter than the rest

[1:10:51] king room and the locusts and he cut
[1:10:53] down this bride tree even a little bit
