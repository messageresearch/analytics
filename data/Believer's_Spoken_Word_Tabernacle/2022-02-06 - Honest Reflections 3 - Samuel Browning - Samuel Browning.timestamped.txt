[34:39] amen he's right here with us
[34:41] he's a friend that sticks closer than a
[34:43] brother
[34:44] he said i'd be with you even in you
[34:47] to the end
[34:48] of the age
[34:51] amen we are we are serving an unfailing
[34:54] god
[34:56] many things that we can look back all
[34:58] the way down through
[34:59] the scriptures
[35:01] god would have his prophet in this hour
[35:03] take us back into things even the
[35:05] building of the masterpiece
[35:07] and how that
[35:09] could step back and
[35:10] you know but god was working in each one
[35:13] of those phases of their lives noah god
[35:16] was working in abraham as a matter of
[35:19] fact how brother branham would place it
[35:20] think of the wisdom of god
[35:22] he would speak to us in this manner and
[35:24] show to us that you know when you look
[35:27] at a
[35:29] like michelangelo's
[35:31] the sculpture of moses it has a base
[35:33] that it sets on
[35:35] the base is the foundation is what it's
[35:38] built upon
[35:39] and paul said i've laid the foundation
[35:41] where there no other man can lay but
[35:44] that foundation all the parts within it
[35:46] because remember
[35:49] four is the number of life
[35:51] four is a number of earthly deliveries
[35:55] and in that pedestal you have an abraham
[35:58] represented which is that of the
[36:00] election of god
[36:03] then you have isaac the love of god
[36:06] then you have jacob and brother graham
[36:08] says oh anybody that's ever read jacob's
[36:10] life knows about the grace of god
[36:14] and then you have joseph perfection
[36:16] that is the foundation of the faith of
[36:19] jesus christ that our lives are built
[36:23] upon
[36:24] that's what the new birth brings in our
[36:26] life
[36:26] it brings the reveal the election of god
[36:29] to our hearts amen it reveals and
[36:32] manifests the love of god through our
[36:34] lives the grace of god and the
[36:36] perfection of god
[36:38] amen and we're built up as brother
[36:40] braham said the body notice he said the
[36:42] body is built by the word the prophets
[36:47] amen i'm glad we're
[36:48] we're not made by man
[36:50] our experience is not a man-made
[36:52] experience amen we're not walking by the
[36:55] dictates of a man
[36:57] oh my our eyes have been opened
[37:01] our eyes have been opened i
[37:02] i think here you know
[37:05] brother branham made a statement in the
[37:07] message where there were some people
[37:08] that you know were they they were
[37:10] complaining of talking about the tapes
[37:11] and things like that and here was
[37:13] another man that had got a hold of the
[37:15] tapes brother bam just rehearsing to
[37:16] this
[37:17] people were saying ah my you know i just
[37:19] say with brother branham i'm just
[37:20] confused and this and that brother
[37:22] branham he recites back what someone has
[37:24] said regarding the tapes that person
[37:26] said i was confused until i started
[37:30] listening to the tapes
[37:32] i'm telling you we were confused until
[37:35] this message came our way
[37:38] you want to know how to break confusion
[37:40] over your life get in the message
[37:43] well brother samuel i'm looking at this
[37:44] website get off of that website
[37:47] oh i listen to this brother preach and
[37:48] not saying that you shouldn't maybe that
[37:50] it's not okay to listen to somebody
[37:52] minister but remember we have received a
[37:54] message in this hour
[37:57] avail ourselves in this message
[38:01] because god has sent this message to you
[38:04] and i and in this message
[38:06] is rapturing faith
[38:09] it gives us strength to fly in this hour
[38:13] we're not living in an hour think about
[38:15] all the other four anointings think of
[38:17] the four anointings that was there the
[38:19] lion
[38:21] four feet on the ground
[38:23] but it manifested kingly power in the
[38:25] earth
[38:26] there's a part of that in our life there
[38:28] has to be a manifesting of kingly power
[38:30] in our life that there has been a
[38:32] kingdom that has been overthrown and a
[38:34] new king has come in on the throne
[38:36] and it manifests itself
[38:38] visibly in this earth
[38:41] then we also have the the ox
[38:44] right
[38:45] feet on the ground
[38:47] a life that sacrifice
[38:49] labor
[38:50] labor of love
[38:52] then we have
[38:53] the next part
[38:55] the man
[38:57] the man anointed
[38:58] right
[38:59] the wisdom of man
[39:01] the the
[39:02] that part that god would tap in but once
[39:04] again
[39:05] it's feet on the ground
[39:07] all of it's necessary but in this hour
[39:10] god has sent the eagle anointing
[39:13] and the eagle anointing is not an
[39:15] earth-bound anointing
[39:16] the eagle anointing is that which came
[39:18] from the heavenlies down to earth
[39:21] not that we would become settled upon
[39:23] the earth but that we would be caught up
[39:26] caught up in him strengthened in him
[39:29] oh glory be to god
[39:32] oh don't you love him yes
[39:34] i know the master of the wind
[39:37] i know the maker
[39:39] amen aren't you glad this morning
[39:42] amen i just love him
[39:44] we're going to let you be seated here
[39:46] just a moment
[39:50] i'm going to ask brother shane if he'll
[39:52] come and i want him to present just a
[39:56] few slides here
[39:58] these they've put together
[40:00] so appreciate everything that the
[40:02] trustees here have done so i'm just
[40:04] going to
[40:05] turn it over him here in just a moment
[40:07] and
[40:08] as he's making ready here
[40:11] as you brothers will switch that over
[40:12] when he gets it up i also want to remind
[40:14] you
[40:15] the calendar that was sent out
[40:17] of lord willing have a fellowship dinner
[40:19] here coming up on the 20th which is two
[40:21] weeks from this coming sunday and then
[40:24] also was mentioned in there of the
[40:27] memorial day meetings that we'll have
[40:29] coming up and there'll be more details
[40:32] uh in memorial day remembers in in may
[40:35] that's may
[40:36] be before we know it
[40:38] i mean there's things that uh well i
[40:40] won't go into that because you could
[40:41] probably say oh brother you're mine but
[40:43] my mind's not too off i i
[40:46] i'm glad it's sharp on certain things
[40:47] when it comes to the word of god
[40:50] other things that i forget here and
[40:51] there oh my you know i complain but say
[40:53] god don't don't let that leave me you
[40:55] know i like when though that comes back
[40:56] to me but remember memorial day meetings
[40:58] here at the end of may and then also
[41:00] next uh sunday lord willing the special
[41:03] offering and brother shane's going to
[41:04] touch on some of these things here
[41:07] amen
[41:08] god bless you church
[41:11] brother richie brother aaron and myself
[41:13] has some exciting news this morning i'll
[41:15] try to be quick
[41:17] but first before i go to the next slide
[41:19] a couple weeks ago brother sam had
[41:21] offered a prayer for this project
[41:24] and uh to be honest we're really at
[41:26] least for myself we're really struggling
[41:28] to get a hold of these contractors
[41:29] because it's the end of the year they're
[41:31] kind of wrapping things up and
[41:34] i don't know who was praying or if
[41:35] everyone was praying but things changed
[41:38] and uh
[41:39] people who i've tried to reach out i
[41:41] mean i've called three four times left
[41:43] voicemails nothing emails nothing texts
[41:46] nothing
[41:47] and it's like all of a sudden it's like
[41:49] that following week after that sunday he
[41:51] had said that like
[41:52] like they answered their phone it was
[41:54] like whoa
[41:56] things changed so uh anyway
[41:58] so we have awarded the bid to brooks
[42:01] concrete they're out of lorraine they're
[42:03] pretty familiar in the area
[42:05] and we're going to start this in may if
[42:08] he can't get us in may it'd be first
[42:09] week of june
[42:11] for the amount beginning at the do the
[42:13] job is 17
[42:15] thousand four hundred dollars and then
[42:17] upon completion seven thousand four
[42:19] hundred dollars per total of fourteen
[42:20] thousand eight
[42:22] and then uh instead of doing phases i
[42:25] quickly learned i'm not
[42:27] i don't know much about concrete but uh
[42:30] from speaking with four to five
[42:32] different contractors instead of
[42:34] grouping it and i think we had four or
[42:36] five phases we're going to do it all in
[42:38] one it's actually a lot cheaper
[42:40] so this will
[42:41] again the the north
[42:43] west side where brother samuel parks and
[42:45] then up through the playground area that
[42:48] will be part of it the front walkway the
[42:50] entrance ramp and then the front porch
[42:52] that will all be done through brook's
[42:54] concrete and then
[42:56] we'll get a group of brothers together
[42:58] to do the metal roof extension over the
[43:00] ramp and the porch so that we'll be
[43:03] doing that ourselves
[43:05] and then just a quick reminder of what
[43:06] it's going to look like you have the
[43:09] current wood
[43:10] there will be a concrete ramp four feet
[43:12] wide 27 four feet long 27 feet long and
[43:16] then a four feet wide concrete
[43:19] side
[43:20] and it'll be similar to this with the
[43:23] black railing
[43:26] and then you got your concrete pad
[43:29] with the two steps on the left and the
[43:31] right
[43:32] and then they'll have these same
[43:33] railings here around it
[43:37] and then here's the concrete walkway
[43:40] this is the same thing from the first
[43:42] slide just in case you forgot
[43:46] and then from the total collected on
[43:48] december 19th we had 2 191
[43:52] and on january 9th we had 1 304
[43:56] for total so far of 3
[43:58] 495
[43:59] so the remaining cost of the project is
[44:02] 11 305
[44:05] and then this next slide is just kind of
[44:08] looking ahead obviously we're one step
[44:10] at a time but i know it's talked about a
[44:11] lot the church parking lot is
[44:14] you know
[44:15] in need of some work but we also got
[44:18] this quoted for just
[44:20] it's a big number uh seventy thousand
[44:23] dollars for the whole parking lot
[44:25] and then the right driveway which is
[44:27] currently concrete right now
[44:29] is seventeen thousand five hundred
[44:31] dollars just just something to think
[44:33] about we're not jumping on this now
[44:36] just wanted to present that he said god
[44:38] bless
[44:40] [Applause]
[44:46] stan
[44:48] i appreciate that
[44:54] shane mentioned it was true they weren't
[44:56] getting any bids back and when you look
[44:57] at the bid that they
[45:00] they didn't just accept the bid that was
[45:01] the lowest
[45:03] but that is the lowest bid
[45:05] brother shane
[45:06] when he was doing the contact for
[45:09] different ones
[45:10] the ones that we had narrowed down and
[45:12] they could have
[45:14] the brothers could have probably asked a
[45:16] lot of other people brother shane went
[45:18] by things that who was recommended
[45:20] within the county and had
[45:22] good ratings
[45:25] because
[45:26] we just didn't want we don't want
[45:28] something just to be done to do it
[45:30] we want something that's done well
[45:33] and uh so
[45:34] we're so thankful that they
[45:36] god turned that around they got
[45:38] everything got back with us and they
[45:39] were able to look at all the bids that
[45:41] were there and
[45:42] some of the bids
[45:44] were much higher
[45:47] close to double
[45:48] that amount and one of the things that
[45:50] as shane pointed out
[45:53] this this the walkway that we have out
[45:55] here right now is real real wide it's
[45:57] like a driveway the sidewalk that's
[45:59] going in there is not going to be that
[46:00] wide it's going to be a sidewalk but
[46:02] it's going to be built up
[46:04] so everything's going to be raised up so
[46:05] then we go to do the parking lot and
[46:07] start to grade that and there's other
[46:09] things that we have to take care of
[46:10] brother ritchie we're talking about that
[46:13] the brothers
[46:14] that over and there
[46:17] so that everything can be graded off
[46:18] because there's some other things with
[46:20] the water
[46:21] right now and
[46:22] i don't mean to take time but you
[46:24] realize there's a lot of times we've had
[46:26] things where everyone said what about
[46:27] the parking lot the parking lot well
[46:30] you remember when we did the chip and
[46:31] seal parking lot back in the days
[46:34] and it shipped
[46:36] it broke up like like nothing
[46:38] and the reason one of the things is so
[46:41] right here is there's no channeling of
[46:42] that water
[46:44] they got water that and if we were to
[46:45] put concrete down at that time which
[46:47] yeah it was a lot less money but it
[46:49] would have been busted up there was new
[46:50] pieces out here in this driveway that
[46:52] was put out there
[46:54] and because it wasn't raised up it was
[46:57] just busted up in no time so
[46:59] um
[47:00] you know thank god we've had different
[47:02] ones to look at that and there's some
[47:03] ideas on how to channel that that water
[47:06] getting that water because some of it is
[47:08] actually like coming up and brother joey
[47:10] you know you hunt back there bobby you
[47:12] know back there we could we could
[47:13] probably stop that back there with bass
[47:15] and everything go fishing here in the
[47:16] summertime the water is so bad you back
[47:19] in there but it's not just there if you
[47:22] look at a topographic map here of
[47:24] sheffield there's ditches everywhere and
[47:26] that's how they run the water so
[47:28] um
[47:29] just you know let's just be in prayer
[47:31] about all those things certainly
[47:32] appreciate
[47:34] you praying and giving and may god
[47:36] richly bless you
[47:39] let's just turn turn into the word of
[47:41] god i'd like to read from haggai chapter
[47:43] one
[47:44] again
[47:45] i want to go right back into there and
[47:47] i'm just going to
[47:48] this morning i want to just resume
[47:50] from where we were
[47:52] in this thought
[47:53] on honest reflections
[47:56] and uh just pray that you'll just
[47:59] bear with me here this morning we'll
[48:01] just see how far the lord will
[48:03] take us in here because we certainly
[48:05] want to
[48:07] want to hear from him i'm not really
[48:08] interested in how much ground i can
[48:10] cover i just want to make sure that it's
[48:13] following him
[48:15] so in haggai
[48:17] chapter 1 verse 1.
[48:20] you can read there
[48:24] in the second year of darius the king in
[48:26] the sixth month in the first day of the
[48:28] month
[48:29] came the word of the lord by haggai the
[48:32] prophet unto zerubbabel the son of
[48:35] shatil governor of judah
[48:38] and to joshua the son of joseph the high
[48:41] priest saying
[48:42] thus speaketh the lord of hosts saying
[48:45] this people say
[48:47] the time has not come
[48:49] the time
[48:50] that the lord's house
[48:53] should be
[48:54] built
[48:55] let me just you don't have to turn there
[48:57] but if the brothers will pull that up i
[48:59] think i have that in ezra chapter four
[49:01] if you want to you can turn there but i
[49:03] want to just go back into this where we
[49:05] stop that because i want to move from
[49:07] here
[49:08] we're finding where the people
[49:10] that is what's being spoken through them
[49:12] at that time the time has not come
[49:15] so then we look back here in ezra 4
[49:18] we're looking back at what is the source
[49:20] of the problem why
[49:22] are are they expressing
[49:25] that this is not the time
[49:28] there was they wasn't saying it's not
[49:30] god's will
[49:32] uh to not rebuild the temple that's not
[49:35] what they were saying they were just
[49:37] pushing it out to a latter time
[49:39] and so when looking at the source of the
[49:42] problem remember brother branham would
[49:43] take us in the message he that is in you
[49:46] and brother branham would deal with
[49:48] situations that that are being seen
[49:51] whether it's through ministers or other
[49:52] things like that and brother brahm says
[49:54] now he says we must find the source of
[49:57] the problem
[49:58] and dealing with the source of the
[50:00] problem here we come into ezra 4 and
[50:02] verse 1 and it says when the adversaries
[50:05] of judah and benjamin heard that the
[50:08] children of the captivity builded the
[50:10] temple unto the lord god of israel
[50:13] then they came to zerubbabel
[50:15] and to the chief of the fathers and said
[50:18] unto them
[50:19] let us build with you for we seek your
[50:21] god as you do now notice this the temple
[50:24] of god is being built and notice the
[50:27] first approach the first approach is in
[50:30] innocency and harmlessness
[50:32] that's how the enemy comes in
[50:35] amen see the enemy has an objective
[50:38] and he has a plan so this is how he
[50:41] approaches it at first to see will they
[50:43] let down
[50:44] on just the innocency
[50:47] hey yeah we'll take you to help build
[50:49] with us
[50:50] we do sacrifice unto him since the days
[50:53] of the sergeant king of esser which
[50:55] brought us up thither
[50:57] and in reality when you nail that down
[50:59] that's not really true they sacrificed
[51:02] all kinds of idols too
[51:04] it was just
[51:06] so verse three now zerubbabel and joshua
[51:09] the rest of the chief of the fathers of
[51:11] israel said unto them
[51:13] ye have nothing to do with us to build a
[51:16] house unto our god
[51:18] but we ourselves together will build
[51:21] unto the lord god of israel as king
[51:23] cyrus the king of persia hath commanded
[51:25] us now notice
[51:27] they came to the they came to the
[51:29] leadership and the leadership put a
[51:31] start stop to it right away
[51:33] this is not coming into my home this is
[51:36] not coming into the camp
[51:38] amen
[51:39] are you hearing me the leadership was
[51:41] there to discern and say this is not
[51:43] going to be discussed at dinner
[51:45] over there's no discussion to this
[51:48] we know what god has said and this is
[51:50] not coming in to say well you think we
[51:52] should pray about it no this is what god
[51:54] has said there's no discussion there's
[51:56] no prayer this is an attack of the enemy
[51:58] amen that's why in this hour we must
[52:00] must must walk by spiritual discernment
[52:04] because sometimes the things that we can
[52:05] see can give us seemingly nice warm
[52:08] fuzzies
[52:09] but it's not of god
[52:13] amen
[52:15] verse 4
[52:17] then the people of the land weakened the
[52:20] hands of the people of judah now what
[52:22] same people now watch how they're coming
[52:24] now they weakened the hands of the
[52:26] people of judah and troubled them in
[52:30] building
[52:31] wow these are the same guys that were oh
[52:34] you guys you guys are new in the
[52:35] neighborhood here's a here's a
[52:37] chocolate cake we've baked for you and
[52:39] i'm not saying that's wonderful your
[52:40] neighbor bakes it you know
[52:42] let it all be received with thanksgiving
[52:44] pray over it and
[52:45] eat it maybe not all in the same night
[52:46] but you understand
[52:49] because when we're looking at this here
[52:51] they come now it's they're not coming
[52:53] with a nice big cake
[52:55] here they're coming this has been the
[52:57] mission the whole time you didn't
[52:58] respond to it that way
[53:00] now we'll move to another horse
[53:03] see this is the this is the ride that
[53:04] has taken place down through the ages
[53:06] from the white horse now to a red horse
[53:08] now we're going to come with power
[53:10] then the people of the land weaken the
[53:12] hands of the people of judah and
[53:15] troubled them in building and hired
[53:18] counselors against them
[53:21] to frustrate their purpose
[53:24] all the days of cyrus king of persia
[53:27] even until the reign of darius king of
[53:30] persia
[53:31] i tell you
[53:32] these people if we could say it like
[53:34] this they that hired counselors and they
[53:36] that come
[53:37] they had this whole work
[53:39] and a picture on their refrigerator and
[53:42] they were saying
[53:43] we must stop this
[53:46] we must stop this because you see how
[53:49] this work had started the people were
[53:51] gathered as one man to jerusalem
[53:54] there was a uniting that had come with a
[53:57] vision and a purpose and satan's desire
[53:59] was to break that unity break that
[54:01] purpose to weaken them if they won't
[54:04] accept my in the innocency then i'm just
[54:06] going to just i'm just not going to stop
[54:08] i'm going to keep pounding at him keep
[54:10] pounding at him keep i'll bring all
[54:11] sorts of things to eventually they let
[54:13] down
[54:16] let's pray
[54:18] heavenly father
[54:21] we thank you this morning for your mercy
[54:24] your god we ask you that you will just
[54:27] have your way in this service
[54:30] lord i would ask that you would just
[54:32] help me
[54:33] help the man part to step aside
[54:36] i'm asking that you'll come lord in a
[54:38] very personal way even as the hearts of
[54:41] your children are praying lord that god
[54:44] you'll just pass by our way and speak to
[54:46] our hearts in a personal way we give
[54:48] ourselves to you lord for your working
[54:51] lord for your glory may you just pour
[54:53] out of your spirit among us in a very
[54:55] special and personal way we pray in the
[54:58] name of jesus christ amen
[55:01] god bless you for being seated
[55:03] i also want to
[55:05] get in here into the subject here i want
[55:07] to welcome back sister judith and
[55:10] her daughter

[55:19] doleen but i get that right god bless
[55:21] you good to have you
[55:25] good to have you amen so i just want to
[55:29] just welcome them
[55:31] if there's anybody else we missed for
[55:32] the bobby you michelle
[55:38] you know i you know one thing i'll tell
[55:40] you i know i have many faults and you
[55:42] could probably list them for me
[55:44] but i may have a longer list than you
[55:47] the one thing that i have as real as a
[55:49] fault is i get up here i can see certain
[55:51] things oh yes
[55:53] my mind i've got a one-track mind when
[55:55] it comes to standing here
[55:56] i don't say that for any i just say i i
[55:58] forget there's some things that i do
[56:00] because we miss you when you're not here
[56:02] and so glad to have you all here back
[56:05] with us and then see different ones that
[56:07] they met just with us recovering i also
[56:10] want to remember uh continue to remember
[56:12] sister shirley press and prayer god will
[56:14] just continue to strengthen our sister
[56:17] and her body as well
[56:19] and uh just brother dave's good to see
[56:21] you here
[56:23] we just um
[56:25] i know brother dave is
[56:27] been dealing with some pain as well in
[56:30] his body not some but
[56:32] we talked about that and
[56:34] also want to
[56:35] want to encourage his sister my my aunt
[56:38] linda i don't know if they put the
[56:39] prayer request in
[56:41] i know they did but um it's natural for
[56:45] the lungs to fill up with water and then
[56:46] they have to drain them off and then
[56:48] they said that's natural
[56:50] she's had to have that done twice
[56:53] already
[56:54] and i just just want to encourage you
[56:56] is when you're praying
[56:58] not only for
[57:00] sister linda but for every need
[57:03] don't stop praying until like peter
[57:07] they're knocking on the door amen
[57:09] you hear they're getting better oh they
[57:10] went out the first ward keep praying oh
[57:12] they're out the second word keep praying
[57:13] oh they're out the third lord keep
[57:14] praying oh they're out the city keep
[57:16] praying keep praying until they
[57:18] stand right there amen that's good amen
[57:23] oh we just love the lord but i want to
[57:26] just take just for a few moments here
[57:29] just to
[57:30] look upon these things
[57:32] in honest reflections
[57:36] in ezra chapter 4 continuing on there
[57:39] here you have in verse 23
[57:43] these people that continue to so not
[57:46] only are they coming against
[57:49] those who have come back to jerusalem
[57:53] um under zerubbabel and joshua to
[57:57] build the temple
[57:59] ezra's not come yet nehemiah's not come
[58:02] yet
[58:04] you see the temple's got to be
[58:06] built then the teacher comes
[58:10] are you with me see this is all the
[58:12] layers of the new birth
[58:14] then once the new birth has come then
[58:16] you build up the walls
[58:18] god doesn't take care of the outside
[58:20] first he deals with the inside
[58:22] he works from the inside out when he
[58:24] gets on the inside then he'll show you
[58:26] how to use the gates and put the bars
[58:28] and everything upon them
[58:30] so
[58:31] because everything in the scripture all
[58:34] of it is to speak of jesus christ and
[58:36] that of redemption so
[58:38] they were coming the the the adversaries
[58:41] notice how the scriptures identifies
[58:44] them even before as they're coming in
[58:46] innocency that they are adversaries and
[58:48] this is where we can say god i i need
[58:52] the continual
[58:53] discernment of the holy spirit i want to
[58:56] stay close to him
[58:57] so that there are things that i myself
[59:00] would not be able to discern without his
[59:03] leadership as a matter of fact brother
[59:04] branham would say it like this when he
[59:06] would deal with um
[59:08] in in the the first seal and he would
[59:11] say that that antichrist that spirit he
[59:14] said he's a cunning fellow daniel speaks
[59:16] of him being a cunning fellow he's he's
[59:18] we see even in the garden of eden more
[59:20] subtle he was a very subtle person right
[59:24] not the the serpent was subtle but satan
[59:26] came in and anointed that fertility
[59:29] is that right he used that right and
[59:31] this is why even in this hour that the
[59:33] scripture says he is worshiped satan is
[59:36] worshipped as god and he's worshiped
[59:38] through the reasoning and the knowledge
[59:41] and all the theology of man
[59:43] but we know that there's one provided
[59:45] way of worship and that's through the
[59:46] blood
[59:48] there's one place that we're to come
[59:50] through and that's the blood but notice
[59:52] it's called that of an adversary and
[59:54] brother brahm tells us with that
[59:56] antichrist he said there's no one that
[59:58] can undo him or outsmart him but the
[1:00:02] holy ghost
[1:00:03] and that's why in this hour that that's
[1:00:06] what the message of the hour has brought
[1:00:09] to our lives is a uniting with the holy
[1:00:12] ghost
[1:00:14] not a sensation
[1:00:16] we'll take them
[1:00:17] not an emotion we take them hey come on
[1:00:19] now
[1:00:20] you can't put emotion and sensation out
[1:00:24] you're going to be emotional about
[1:00:25] something
[1:00:26] but when god has come down in the depths
[1:00:28] of your heart you've got something real
[1:00:31] to be emotional about
[1:00:38] oh jesus help us
[1:00:40] so notice adversaries the discernment
[1:00:44] coming in that manner the verse ezra
[1:00:46] chapter 4 verse 23 here is a letter
[1:00:50] that's coming from
[1:00:51] azerxes
[1:00:53] and this is read before riam and shimsha
[1:00:56] verse 23 the scribe and their companions
[1:00:59] and they went up in haste to jerusalem
[1:01:02] unto the jews these guys weren't messing
[1:01:04] around they were doing everything they
[1:01:06] could to try to shut them down and when
[1:01:07] they realized hey they're not shutting
[1:01:09] down they started bringing false
[1:01:11] accusations against them
[1:01:14] i know a lot of times we hear the words
[1:01:16] sticks and stones
[1:01:17] uh may break my bones but words will
[1:01:20] never hurt me but that's not really true
[1:01:24] that's not really true
[1:01:26] false accusations this is why with false
[1:01:28] accusations you can either allow them to
[1:01:31] accumulate in your life or take them
[1:01:33] before the throne of almighty god you
[1:01:36] got a choice
[1:01:37] if we allow them to accumulate in our
[1:01:39] life we find ourselves going down down
[1:01:42] down but if we'll take our lives before
[1:01:45] the throne of god then we begin to see
[1:01:47] things in a different light
[1:01:51] notice they went up in haste to
[1:01:53] jerusalem unto the jews and made them to
[1:01:56] cease
[1:01:57] by force and power
[1:01:59] then cease the work of the house of god
[1:02:02] which is at jerusalem now i want you i
[1:02:05] want you just to think of this
[1:02:07] here they are they're made to stop
[1:02:10] by force and by power
[1:02:16] but they didn't come back to jerusalem
[1:02:18] by natural power
[1:02:21] are you hearing me now
[1:02:23] they didn't come back there by natural
[1:02:24] power
[1:02:25] this was a vision of the word that god
[1:02:29] had already spoken and prophesied
[1:02:32] through jeremiah god had revealed it
[1:02:35] through daniel they did not come back
[1:02:38] there of their own natural cord listen
[1:02:40] it is not within man to find his way
[1:02:43] back
[1:02:45] they might have knew the land well we
[1:02:47] got to get back to jerusalem but the way
[1:02:49] back you must know the way back
[1:02:53] and the way back was not a natural way
[1:02:56] it was a spiritual way
[1:02:59] their heart had went away from god so
[1:03:02] their heart had to be turned back to
[1:03:05] jerusalem
[1:03:09] and that was inspiration that was sealed
[1:03:13] up in the prophecy but when that
[1:03:15] prophecy would begin to be opened in
[1:03:18] that hour remember within that prophecy
[1:03:21] lays an anointing because the true
[1:03:23] anointing upon our life is the word of
[1:03:26] almighty god
[1:03:27] that's why the person says i've been
[1:03:29] born of the holy ghost and they don't
[1:03:31] live in the word walk in the word and
[1:03:34] reflect the word of god and says amen to
[1:03:36] everything in the word of god they have
[1:03:39] not been anointed by the word and have
[1:03:42] not been born again
[1:03:44] they might have had an anointing upon
[1:03:46] their flesh upon their mind and upon
[1:03:48] their spirit but when that anointing of
[1:03:51] the word comes down where the word
[1:03:53] unites with the word inside in your soul
[1:03:56] it changes your life from a creature of
[1:03:59] time to a creature of eternity you're
[1:04:02] not an old man patched up you are a new
[1:04:04] creation
[1:04:07] oh let's look at the word correctly this
[1:04:09] morning don't look down say if it is
[1:04:12] there with air in your life and you're
[1:04:14] seeing something it's the light of god
[1:04:17] shining upon his word that allows us to
[1:04:20] look into the smear and say woe is me
[1:04:22] lord change my life lord change me
[1:04:26] completely
[1:04:32] so this foundation
[1:04:34] had been a foundation laid
[1:04:37] but it was in an unfinished state
[1:04:42] i don't know about you but there's
[1:04:43] things at times that
[1:04:45] i've even got a project right now around
[1:04:47] my around my house i've been
[1:04:49] little by little and sometimes because
[1:04:51] i'm not a builder i'm not at this that i
[1:04:53] i have to think about things a little
[1:04:55] bit longer
[1:04:56] and
[1:04:58] when you have things that's unfinished
[1:05:01] or you have things that maybe it's a
[1:05:02] hole in the wall
[1:05:04] hole in the ceiling
[1:05:06] or you've got something that maybe
[1:05:07] carpets not down whatever it is it's
[1:05:10] only a reminder that's not finished
[1:05:14] it's something that you walk by every
[1:05:15] day and man i got to get to that
[1:05:18] i got to get on that all right
[1:05:21] and see that foundation
[1:05:24] they had laid that under great pain and
[1:05:27] great stress and under great persecution
[1:05:31] but now
[1:05:33] where they were at it was an unfinished
[1:05:35] state
[1:05:37] now let me tell you something god could
[1:05:39] have come down and god could have spoke
[1:05:40] that temple into existence
[1:05:46] but that is not his way
[1:05:50] just like when god comes to deal with
[1:05:52] our life the real birth of the holy
[1:05:55] ghost is a word birth
[1:05:57] it's a word experience is that right
[1:06:00] it's by the spoken word of almighty god
[1:06:06] but god won't override our will
[1:06:10] it has to be i will surrender to his
[1:06:13] will that's called dying to south and
[1:06:16] when that is that comes to that place
[1:06:18] then the will of god breaks forth fully
[1:06:21] in our life to bring forth the new birth
[1:06:25] unfinished state
[1:06:28] god is an author and a finisher you
[1:06:30] believe that amen
[1:06:34] he's not gonna god don't do nothing
[1:06:36] halfway
[1:06:38] amen and this is the promise he said he
[1:06:41] will perform it until the day of jesus
[1:06:43] christ now i want you to to examine this
[1:06:46] as we're looking in honest reflection i
[1:06:48] want you to examine it and allow the
[1:06:50] holy spirit to examine for every aspect
[1:06:54] of our life and every no matter where
[1:06:56] you're at in your walk with god
[1:06:59] whether you haven't started or you have
[1:07:01] started and maybe here you are in
[1:07:03] journey to to that of the new birth and
[1:07:05] then others that of us that have been
[1:07:07] born again have already crossed into
[1:07:09] that land this the supplies this right
[1:07:12] here applies to every one of us
[1:07:16] right you say brother samuel what do you
[1:07:17] mean well let me just be very simple you
[1:07:20] can't listen to the message of the hour
[1:07:23] i don't care what message you pick out
[1:07:24] you cannot listen to that message and
[1:07:27] not have the reality of the new birth
[1:07:31] not being ministered
[1:07:33] amen sometimes it's said specifically
[1:07:36] are you hearing me that's good
[1:07:38] other times here it is it now stands for
[1:07:41] the light shines forth and anytime when
[1:07:43] we're listening and really listening to
[1:07:45] the message of the hour there should
[1:07:47] really be some gleaning and feeding
[1:07:49] going on don't just be a listener be a
[1:07:51] feeder
[1:07:52] a feeder sometimes you've got to stop it
[1:07:54] and say lord help me to live up to that
[1:07:57] standard of the word that's being a
[1:08:00] feeder we don't want to be a hearer we
[1:08:02] want to be doers of the word we've not
[1:08:04] been anointed just to hear we've been
[1:08:06] anointed to do there's something that
[1:08:09] moves within us
[1:08:11] oh glory be to god we're interested in
[1:08:14] getting out of here

[1:10:14] very important that there be no leak at
[1:10:17] all
[1:10:17] [Music]
[1:10:20] now notice in daniel 9 25
[1:10:24] this was already spoken this whole
[1:10:28] part of what would take place when they
[1:10:30] came back into the land in verse 25
[1:10:32] this is when gabriel is making known to
[1:10:36] daniel
[1:10:37] when daniel had begun to remember the
[1:10:39] inspiration regarding that of the 70 of
[1:10:42] the 70 weeks and so forth notice he says
[1:10:45] that knowing therefore and understand
[1:10:47] that from the going forth of the
[1:10:48] commandment to restore and to build
[1:10:51] jerusalem unto the messiah the prince
[1:10:54] shall be seven weeks
[1:10:56] and three score in two weeks so two
[1:10:58] separate time periods seven weeks and
[1:11:00] then the three score in two weeks then
[1:11:02] messiah prince comes but notice now it
[1:11:04] breaks back over here into those seven
[1:11:07] weeks which is that period of time the
[1:11:09] 49 years when they were going to go back
[1:11:12] into jerusalem to rebuild the temple
[1:11:14] after their deliverance from babylon the
[1:11:17] street shall be built again and the wall
[1:11:21] even
[1:11:22] in troublest times
[1:11:26] go and let them know it's going to be
[1:11:28] troubleless times but you know it's
[1:11:30] something about it that that does not
[1:11:32] become the emphasis
[1:11:35] that was not the emphasis in leaving
[1:11:38] jerusalem
[1:11:40] i mean sometimes let me just be very
[1:11:42] frank with you sometimes
[1:11:44] the really serving god we need to we we
[1:11:47] will say god help me to be a real
[1:11:49] example that it would be something that
[1:11:50] somebody says you know what i want what
[1:11:52] you got yes lord because what we have
[1:11:55] should produce real joy amen
[1:11:58] come on friends there's a power in this
[1:12:00] world to break depression
[1:12:04] this is not condemnation there's a power
[1:12:07] in this word you say what must i do say
[1:12:09] what the word says and rebuke the
[1:12:12] devourer back him up off of your land
[1:12:15] you've got to write as a child of god
[1:12:18] amen he can try to condemn you and say
[1:12:20] well look at you you're depressed or
[1:12:22] you're anxious or you're sick or you're
[1:12:24] this or that that's a that's a false
[1:12:26] accusation he's coming against the
[1:12:29] working of a real son and daughter of
[1:12:32] god what should i do i take the side of
[1:12:34] the word and regardless of what my
[1:12:36] feeling said i say what the word said
[1:12:39] and say food devil
[1:12:41] amen
[1:12:43] i can only move my pinky brother man i'm
[1:12:45] told it's clean you move the pinky next
[1:12:47] you'll be moving your hand you move your
[1:12:49] hand then you'll be moving your arm
[1:12:50] after you move your arm then you'll
[1:12:52] start moving both arms then eventually
[1:12:54] you get up off the bed little by little
[1:12:56] by little by little amen
[1:13:00] amen
[1:13:02] glory be to god
[1:13:04] say brother samuel what are you saying
[1:13:06] well
[1:13:07] i'm saying like this right here
[1:13:10] that
[1:13:11] is there any fight in you
[1:13:14] are you hearing me
[1:13:16] is there any fight in you if we could
[1:13:18] ask these these these individuals here
[1:13:21] they have been getting blasted and
[1:13:23] adversaries and everything coming at
[1:13:25] them but you know what it was it wasn't
[1:13:26] the adversaries that shut them down
[1:13:30] it's because they got away from
[1:13:32] their source of strength
[1:13:36] there wasn't any fight in them because
[1:13:39] they got away from their source of
[1:13:41] strength now hear me really closely i'm
[1:13:42] not going to preach on this this morning
[1:13:44] but a source of strength isn't just
[1:13:46] standing up here and asking god for
[1:13:47] prayer but a source of strength god can
[1:13:50] pray and bring down in our faith and if
[1:13:52] you don't have faith god has faith as
[1:13:54] faith right here provided i can place my
[1:13:56] faith right there and pray and i believe
[1:13:59] the prayer of faith shall save the sick
[1:14:01] and god shall raise them up i believe
[1:14:03] that there's quickening power right here
[1:14:06] in the body of jesus christ but it
[1:14:08] matters what you do after you go out of
[1:14:10] here amen your source of strength is a
[1:14:13] daily
[1:14:14] daily daily walk with god
[1:14:18] amen
[1:14:19] yes sir but brother samuel i thought
[1:14:21] everything was going to be a picnic no
[1:14:23] we know better than that troubleless
[1:14:24] times
[1:14:26] troubleless times
[1:14:28] persecution comes in many different
[1:14:30] forms
[1:14:33] but jesus said upon this rock i will
[1:14:35] build my church
[1:14:37] and the gates of hell shall not be able
[1:14:40] to prevail against it
[1:14:44] second timothy 3 12 78
[1:14:47] and all that live godly in christ jesus
[1:14:50] shall suffer persecution
[1:14:52] let me just say it like this i'm not
[1:14:54] going around with a banner saying hey
[1:14:57] i'd like some persecution i'm not a fool
[1:15:01] they didn't ask for persecution
[1:15:03] persecution was coming their way
[1:15:05] anybody walk around and say you know
[1:15:07] what i ain't been sick in a while i
[1:15:08] think i'd right like be sick
[1:15:11] if you do you need prayer for something
[1:15:12] else
[1:15:15] nobody walks around like that like
[1:15:17] remember brother jewel when he was here
[1:15:18] years ago told the story of a man that
[1:15:20] said you know what i ain't had a test in
[1:15:22] a trial for a long time man i ain't had
[1:15:24] nothing
[1:15:25] i'll tell you what brother you you
[1:15:26] better better not be praying that and
[1:15:27] all of a sudden that brother got way
[1:15:28] late
[1:15:30] see god knows what you and i are able to
[1:15:33] handle amen are you hearing me there's
[1:15:36] tests and trials you go through right
[1:15:37] now as a believer let me say this to you
[1:15:40] even with the experience in your life
[1:15:43] god has so fitted it because the trial
[1:15:46] and the test is not upon you to destroy
[1:15:50] you
[1:15:50] it's to prove you
[1:15:54] it's god's not against you that's what
[1:15:57] satan that's the lie he told you all
[1:16:00] right brother brown said when job got to
[1:16:02] listening to it that's what had him
[1:16:04] whipped come on you can read the book of
[1:16:07] job and you know joe started trying to
[1:16:09] justify himself you still want moving
[1:16:11] him from his message
[1:16:13] come on friends there's times that you
[1:16:15] can get weak but that's why you need the
[1:16:18] holy ghost in your life you might get
[1:16:20] weak you might get down but when all
[1:16:22] your human reasoning breaks away there
[1:16:25] is an anchor right there in your life
[1:16:30] that'll hold you stable it'll hold you
[1:16:33] constant that'll be able to recognize
[1:16:35] the voice of god speaking to it and so
[1:16:38] our feelings might be out here but that
[1:16:41] on the inside we'll catch the voice of
[1:16:43] god and says yes lord
[1:16:51] all that live godly
[1:16:53] in christ jesus shall suffer persecution
[1:16:55] persecution comes jesus remember how
[1:16:58] jesus he wrote of this we see it all the
[1:16:59] way down through the old testament
[1:17:02] matter of fact brother brown would say
[1:17:03] the simple this persecution
[1:17:05] and trials
[1:17:07] are a natural
[1:17:08] normal
[1:17:10] part of life
[1:17:13] it's just as normal as
[1:17:15] clothing food shelter
[1:17:18] it's normal
[1:17:20] and brother brad makes it clear he says
[1:17:22] there's not one believer free from it
[1:17:25] not one church free from it
[1:17:30] see
[1:17:31] when we see this there's only one thing
[1:17:33] all that live godly in christ
[1:17:36] now
[1:17:37] the objective
[1:17:39] to live godly in christ satan if he can
[1:17:42] try to cool you off that's right
[1:17:45] they say you know what hey
[1:17:47] uh
[1:17:48] all the demons that were dispatched over
[1:17:50] there you don't need that no more that's
[1:17:52] that's that's already settled and
[1:17:54] stopped i need you over here on this one
[1:17:56] they're blazing hot we got to cool them
[1:17:58] down
[1:18:00] well wonder how we should come at them
[1:18:03] well we've got many avenues to come at
[1:18:05] them
[1:18:05] we've got many avenues to bring
[1:18:07] persecution we can come in real
[1:18:10] innocently
[1:18:12] let's try that approach first
[1:18:15] all right
[1:18:16] they had become weary
[1:18:18] these these these believers they had
[1:18:21] become weary and discouraged you've ever
[1:18:23] been discouraged
[1:18:27] anybody been weary
[1:18:29] yeah over and over in the scripture
[1:18:30] think not all right
[1:18:33] right right
[1:18:34] the discouragement can come but remember
[1:18:37] satan's on a mission
[1:18:39] he's on a mission to break the purpose
[1:18:42] of god
[1:18:44] but let me remind you devil
[1:18:47] we're on a mission too
[1:18:49] [Applause]
[1:18:50] our mission didn't come from an earthly
[1:18:52] headquarters
[1:18:55] come on now we have been commissioned
[1:18:58] yes from heaven amen
[1:19:00] we have heard a voice
[1:19:03] said come out of her my people amen you
[1:19:06] were not ordained to give yourself and
[1:19:09] your lives to all of those influences of
[1:19:11] babylon but you're ordained to be a
[1:19:14] tabernacle a place of habitation come
[1:19:17] out of her and be ye shepherd saith the
[1:19:19] lord we've received a divine commission
[1:19:22] from a mighty angel
[1:19:25] that this message itself that came
[1:19:28] amen it was echoed on earth there
[1:19:31] through the angel that god had sent the
[1:19:34] prophet in this hour and heaven this
[1:19:36] angel and his message was so inclined
[1:19:39] with heaven that heaven echoed that
[1:19:42] message
[1:19:44] what do you say it shows right now that
[1:19:47] just as much as that message as heaven
[1:19:50] was inclined that was inclined with
[1:19:52] heaven that the people of god that are
[1:19:54] moved by this revelation are inclined
[1:19:57] with the mind of god they are in tune
[1:20:00] and in harmony with the holy spirit and
[1:20:03] the purpose of almighty god
[1:20:07] hallelujah
[1:20:10] much pressure had come their way
[1:20:15] every one of us faced pressure
[1:20:21] let us be reminded here
[1:20:24] when god told joshua i've given you the
[1:20:25] land that didn't mean that they only
[1:20:27] could walk just walk in there and just
[1:20:28] take it
[1:20:30] you'll fight for every inch of it
[1:20:34] hallelujah amen god has promised healing
[1:20:37] but you'll fight for every inch of it
[1:20:39] god has promised the baptism of the holy
[1:20:41] ghost you'll fight for every inch of it
[1:20:43] you won't be fighting against god you're
[1:20:45] fighting against your own will
[1:20:48] that's why there's times there's got to
[1:20:49] be a wrestling match like jacob
[1:20:54] when jacob finally surrendered
[1:20:57] come on friends sometimes it might take
[1:20:59] agonizing
[1:21:01] come on brother told us there ain't no
[1:21:03] set pattern it can fall right here while
[1:21:06] the preaching of the word is going forth
[1:21:07] is that right yes but the main thing is
[1:21:10] is that how does the holy ghost come he
[1:21:12] comes when it is a fully surrendered
[1:21:15] repented heart
[1:21:17] amen
[1:21:19] if the holy ghost hasn't come you've got
[1:21:21] to have a full repentance
[1:21:24] a turning from a full surrender
[1:21:28] is that right
[1:21:29] mean business about things if there's
[1:21:31] things in your life and you know that
[1:21:33] the holy ghost won't come on that don't
[1:21:35] make excuses for it go to war against
[1:21:37] that thing you've got god on your side
[1:21:40] amen say i'm here i'm here for the
[1:21:43] promise that god has made to me i don't
[1:21:46] care what the devil is he might be a
[1:21:48] pornographic devil a lust devil a
[1:21:50] drinking devil you can line every one of
[1:21:53] them up they don't have a right to stand
[1:21:55] on the god-given grounds that belongs to
[1:21:58] sons and daughters of god you've got a
[1:22:01] right you are authorized by a power a
[1:22:05] heavenly power that says this land i've
[1:22:08] given you take it amen
[1:22:13] so let us be reminded i've given you the
[1:22:16] land
[1:22:17] and every time god inspires your heart
[1:22:18] to do something satan's going to be
[1:22:20] there to challenge you
[1:22:21] that's right
[1:22:23] he's going to be there to bring every
[1:22:24] kind of accusation against you
[1:22:26] but let's be wise we're not ignorant of
[1:22:28] his devices that's only to try to back
[1:22:30] you up from the promises
[1:22:34] amen
[1:22:35] what do i do maybe start out with a
[1:22:37] little food
[1:22:40] say what the word says about you
[1:22:43] hallelujah
[1:22:45] oh glory be to god
[1:22:47] oh my you know
[1:22:49] satan would be all right
[1:22:50] he's all right you know if people you
[1:22:53] know just be
[1:22:54] just become a church member
[1:22:56] well you know we go to believer spoken
[1:22:58] word tabernacle and
[1:23:00] you know we believe that god sent a
[1:23:01] prophet and he's all right when you
[1:23:03] believe in god sent a prophet he does
[1:23:06] matter of fact he knows
[1:23:08] is that right
[1:23:12] hallelujah
[1:23:14] he knows
[1:23:15] he was cast out night after night
[1:23:19] are you hearing me right now he's into
[1:23:21] no dispute listen
[1:23:23] there ain't no disputing
[1:23:25] satan he knows that's right
[1:23:28] that william branham is the prophet of
[1:23:30] god
[1:23:34] and no disputing that whatsoever he
[1:23:36] knows it
[1:23:36] just as much as he knows that jesus is
[1:23:39] the son of god and he believes it
[1:23:42] and trembles
[1:23:44] but you see he's not believing it in the
[1:23:46] right way
[1:23:50] oh my my he wants to try to cool us off
[1:23:55] all right you see we we we
[1:23:57] we should set our sights and i would say
[1:23:59] it like this
[1:24:00] god help us to set our sights
[1:24:03] i want to be an effectual believer
[1:24:07] i want my life to be effectual
[1:24:09] i'm not interested just showing up to
[1:24:11] church
[1:24:12] i want to be effectual
[1:24:14] amen i want to be a part of the vision
[1:24:17] and what's going on in the kingdom of
[1:24:18] god
[1:24:20] well brother samuel i got this and i got
[1:24:22] this and i got this going on let me
[1:24:24] remind you the scripture as it was in
[1:24:26] the days of noah so shall it also be in
[1:24:28] the coming of the son of man the bible
[1:24:30] says they ate drank and were married
[1:24:32] they busy this is the scripture they
[1:24:35] were so focused on earthly things they
[1:24:38] missed
[1:24:39] the animals going by
[1:24:42] they missed the door being closed
[1:24:45] that's the bible
[1:24:47] they missed it
[1:24:49] they had become so focused with earthly
[1:24:52] things the prophet picks it up flashing
[1:24:54] red lights or is coming nothing wrong
[1:24:55] with eating we might eat a little too
[1:24:57] much but nothing wrong with drinking
[1:24:59] right things
[1:25:00] right right everybody needs water
[1:25:02] brother and pick set up that way
[1:25:03] building none wrong building
[1:25:06] right
[1:25:07] but this is why they became occupied
[1:25:10] with self
[1:25:12] that's so good
[1:25:14] oh god you might preach food he's in
[1:25:16] convention conviction
[1:25:19] satan can't stop the purpose of god
[1:25:22] are you hearing me
[1:25:24] satan can't stop the purpose of god
[1:25:27] he can't stop the word of god from being
[1:25:29] fulfilled
[1:25:31] right
[1:25:31] you know i'm referring to the scriptures
[1:25:33] in romans let's so let's be a partaker
[1:25:36] of the unstoppable god by revelation
[1:25:39] lord yes amen because revelation that
[1:25:43] revelation of jesus christ holds within
[1:25:45] it prevailing power
[1:25:49] you see persecution and all those things
[1:25:51] it comes
[1:25:53] it comes
[1:25:54] adversity comes
[1:25:58] many different forms
[1:26:00] mary brother brown tells us about the
[1:26:02] young girl there was
[1:26:03] two young ladies
[1:26:06] one of them was a um
[1:26:09] we're twins
[1:26:11] brother um
[1:26:13] steve robson robson from mountain
[1:26:15] flagstaff was able to get in contact
[1:26:16] with one of them they're still alive
[1:26:19] and witness of what took place there we
[1:26:21] have it on tape but you know of where
[1:26:23] here you have the one young girl my
[1:26:25] brother brandon i want you to listen to
[1:26:26] me carefully brother brown said she had
[1:26:28] she had you know given her life to
[1:26:30] christ
[1:26:31] so she had had you know an initial
[1:26:33] experience but it wasn't a born-again
[1:26:35] experience
[1:26:36] she hadn't passed from death onto life
[1:26:39] she got out there in college and around
[1:26:41] a lot of these other
[1:26:42] you know in this professor this
[1:26:44] psychologist begin
[1:26:47] to try to
[1:26:49] come at her and say you ain't never
[1:26:50] kissed a boy
[1:26:53] really
[1:26:55] you must be a weirdo
[1:26:58] you know this those of you you listen to
[1:26:59] message and what happened brother
[1:27:01] brandon says that that's pressure that
[1:27:03] came upon her
[1:27:05] it sent her into a mental institution
[1:27:12] now her sister
[1:27:14] she had a full testimony it wasn't that
[1:27:17] pressure didn't come to her
[1:27:20] right
[1:27:20] as soon as you make a stand for god let
[1:27:22] me tell you something it's just like
[1:27:25] every hound of hell has been turned
[1:27:27] loose on you as a matter of fact let's
[1:27:29] put it in the words the prophet said
[1:27:31] every gun out of hell is trained upon
[1:27:34] you he said he'll try to shoot every
[1:27:36] dart at you he'll bring every vowel
[1:27:39] person around you if there's been habits
[1:27:42] in your life he'll line those devils up
[1:27:44] and anoint those people to come what
[1:27:46] you're trying to do he's trying to
[1:27:49] withstand that work that god is doing in
[1:27:52] your lives
[1:27:55] what should i do don't turn to the
[1:27:58] natural things of life turn to your
[1:28:00] source of strength the god who brought
[1:28:03] conviction in your eye for you to repent
[1:28:07] turn to your source of strength and draw
[1:28:10] from him amen
[1:28:20] sometimes people turn to so many other
[1:28:22] things for for answers in their life
[1:28:24] instead of turning to the lord
[1:28:28] in this day and age we have people walk
[1:28:30] around with a phone
[1:28:32] glued to it
[1:28:34] they turn to that for answers
[1:28:37] turn to it for a source of strength but
[1:28:39] i need some down
[1:28:41] really
[1:28:42] when i look at the statistics what i
[1:28:45] read is there's more depression because
[1:28:48] of that stuff
[1:28:49] that's right come on friends i think we
[1:28:52] need to evaluate where's our source of
[1:28:53] strength
[1:28:55] hello somebody i'm not saying oh brother
[1:28:58] simon's against smartphones that's not
[1:28:59] what i'm saying matter of fact mine's
[1:29:01] been very helpful to me when i'm sitting
[1:29:03] in doctor's offices with different ones
[1:29:05] i study on my phone
[1:29:07] i'm not going to say that i'm perfect
[1:29:09] but i'm telling you right now that i do
[1:29:11] appreciate things i'm going to files and
[1:29:12] studying there so because you know what
[1:29:14] when i'm at a doctor's appointment okay
[1:29:15] i just moved from the office and i run
[1:29:16] over here but you understand that's also
[1:29:19] a place where there's temptations placed
[1:29:22] before you
[1:29:23] now help me preach now i'm not all
[1:29:26] speaking of black dark sin i'm talking
[1:29:29] about temptation to where things in your
[1:29:32] life starts building into a place of
[1:29:35] unbelief
[1:29:37] because what you give yourself to
[1:29:40] you will become dominated by
[1:29:43] you must remember white dog and black
[1:29:44] dog when you've been born of the spirit
[1:29:46] of almighty god you must remember it's
[1:29:48] whit dog you feed the most wins
[1:29:57] so persecution is going to come
[1:29:59] but that young lady i was speaking about
[1:30:01] brother branham went there
[1:30:03] and he met with
[1:30:04] her and you know what begin to speak
[1:30:07] and the holy spirit went out and got her
[1:30:09] went on got her spirit right where she
[1:30:11] was and brought it right back around and
[1:30:13] centered it right back around jesus
[1:30:14] christ
[1:30:15] it broke that hole
[1:30:18] let me tell you something these aren't
[1:30:19] just words are you hearing me mom and
[1:30:20] dad these aren't just words right
[1:30:24] well i don't know what my kid is doing
[1:30:25] shame on you you want to know what
[1:30:27] they're doing
[1:30:28] you're called to be responsible for
[1:30:30] those things
[1:30:32] come on friends i sit there in
[1:30:34] conferences with things where where
[1:30:36] parents have spoken that their kids
[1:30:38] sitting right beside them on a couch
[1:30:41] have got into things and they didn't
[1:30:42] even know how to how to do it or the
[1:30:44] parents didn't realize it was going on
[1:30:46] it's kind of almost my mind was sitting
[1:30:48] here trying to figure out how in the
[1:30:49] world you say oh my kids shouldn't do
[1:30:51] that but we believe the message remember
[1:30:53] the token is an application yes amen
[1:30:58] the token isn't well praise god we
[1:31:00] believe the message the token is the
[1:31:02] holy ghost
[1:31:04] you can read the message and know that
[1:31:06] god sent a prophet that's not the token
[1:31:08] the token is the life of jesus christ on
[1:31:12] display and everything must have the
[1:31:14] token
[1:31:25] this is this is right now i i think we
[1:31:28] ought to say that let's say that we're
[1:31:29] now together
[1:31:30] now
[1:31:31] the people are saying oh this ain't the
[1:31:34] time
[1:31:35] i think right now we need to say right
[1:31:37] now is the time
[1:31:39] right now
[1:31:40] whatever you have need of in your life
[1:31:42] it needs to be a declaration right now
[1:31:47] well i failed back here but what about
[1:31:49] now
[1:31:52] you can't go back and change the past
[1:31:53] you can't go back and change the things
[1:31:55] that well you know i wish i would have
[1:31:57] been more fervent here you can't go
[1:31:59] change it but
[1:32:00] you can get back to and go beyond where
[1:32:03] you were how do i get back oh i got to
[1:32:05] get back here got to get back it's a
[1:32:07] condition of the heart
[1:32:17] i'm a lot in time for when brother shane
[1:32:18] was up here we took some of your time
[1:32:20] and
[1:32:21] that's all right with that
[1:32:22] i'll require that a brother shane later
[1:32:26] now that need to be done but i'm just
[1:32:28] let's look here just for a moment
[1:32:30] haggai chapter one verse three let's
[1:32:32] let's read on down could we
[1:32:35] now notice this in verse three let's go
[1:32:36] into this you see god's discerning
[1:32:40] the people are saying now is the time
[1:32:41] has not come now i want you to watch
[1:32:43] this
[1:32:43] god didn't go
[1:32:45] to mama
[1:32:46] god getting god did not go to son and
[1:32:48] daughter
[1:32:49] god reveals his word in a divine order
[1:32:54] are you with me
[1:32:55] that's why god never called the sister
[1:32:57] to leave the home
[1:32:58] that's right preach with me amen god
[1:33:00] never know well i tell you my wife is
[1:33:02] more spiritual than me shame on you
[1:33:05] you're announcing your coldness
[1:33:09] that's good
[1:33:11] can the church say amen yes sir
[1:33:13] that should not be the case
[1:33:16] now you might want to go to a quote on
[1:33:17] me and say well rebecca was more
[1:33:18] spiritual in the case of jacob and esau
[1:33:22] but let me remind you rebecca encouraged
[1:33:24] jacob to lie
[1:33:27] preach brother samuel
[1:33:29] preach brother samuel are you hearing me
[1:33:32] now
[1:33:32] she fostered that nature that was in him
[1:33:36] as a deceiver
[1:33:38] isaac wouldn't have fostered that isaac
[1:33:40] would have said a deceiver won't work
[1:33:43] and a deceiver is not worthy of the
[1:33:45] covenant that's why we are not brought
[1:33:48] into the covenant by a woman ruth never
[1:33:51] came in by a woman ruth came in by boaz
[1:33:54] ram came in by saying oh and we come
[1:33:57] into the body by the man christ jesus
[1:34:01] that's why god didn't send a church in
[1:34:03] this hour and the mighty angel came down
[1:34:06] [Applause]
[1:34:07] [Music]
[1:34:09] the groom has entered the arena first
[1:34:13] he's the initiator of the covenant then
[1:34:15] here comes the bride
[1:34:17] the groom coming is to announce the
[1:34:19] bride is coming amen
[1:34:22] say she's not coming she's here
[1:34:24] hallelujah
[1:34:26] she's here
[1:34:30] there's an order god's entrusted us
[1:34:33] listen as a leader of the home it isn't
[1:34:36] getting around and we're going to do
[1:34:37] this and we don't do that we do this we
[1:34:38] don't do that we do this we don't do
[1:34:39] that look listen friends let's just be
[1:34:41] very honest now
[1:34:42] every one of us coming up through even
[1:34:44] our initial beginnings even when i
[1:34:45] didn't have a family we all tend to
[1:34:48] start out in a very legalistic way
[1:34:54] sometimes
[1:34:55] within our natures it kind of gets stuck
[1:34:58] come on things that ought to be brother
[1:34:59] bram said god has all kinds in his
[1:35:01] kingdom dogmatic ones and this and this
[1:35:02] and this they have to we all have to
[1:35:04] understand our temperament and our
[1:35:06] makeup is that right
[1:35:08] but we want to make sure that we're not
[1:35:10] choking on nats and swallowing camels
[1:35:15] brother so-and-so's not doing this
[1:35:17] they're not doing that what is that
[1:35:18] that's a nat
[1:35:20] and then we got a big old camel going
[1:35:21] down our throat
[1:35:23] come on friends
[1:35:25] my lord have mercy who knew this was all
[1:35:29] packed in here
[1:35:30] jesus hallelujah hey friends this is
[1:35:32] good it's coming right down to where we
[1:35:34] live
[1:35:35] this is about getting out of here oh
[1:35:38] sometimes these things as god brings up
[1:35:40] it can seem awful hard but we know it's
[1:35:42] not a man it's god speaking to us it's
[1:35:44] the love of god being ministered to our
[1:35:47] hearts to get us ready and make us more
[1:35:50] effectual believers as we'll agree with
[1:35:52] the word of god in line up with it
[1:35:56] notice verse 3 then came the word of the
[1:35:58] lord by haggai the prophet saying
[1:36:00] is it time for you
[1:36:02] oh ye to dwell in your
[1:36:04] sealed houses
[1:36:06] and this house lie waste the house of
[1:36:09] now therefore thus saith the lord
[1:36:12] of hosts
[1:36:14] consider your ways
[1:36:17] see the lord of hosts
[1:36:19] oh my
[1:36:22] the innumerable company of angels
[1:36:26] how the angels brother said let the
[1:36:28] angels take their posts throughout every
[1:36:29] one of these buildings
[1:36:30] the building
[1:36:32] next to every person
[1:36:34] brethren even told us why the words
[1:36:36] being preached and there's that nudging
[1:36:37] hey hey you need to surrender that hey
[1:36:39] hey you need to get the right that's an
[1:36:40] angel
[1:36:42] dealing with your life
[1:36:46] amen
[1:36:47] the lord of hosts oh my god's message
[1:36:51] is a message that's letting them know
[1:36:54] the lord of hosts all the angels
[1:36:56] everything is gathered right here is for
[1:36:59] this purpose but before he can be
[1:37:02] restored we need honest reflection
[1:37:05] consider
[1:37:06] that's good your ways
[1:37:09] well brother samuel if you've ever known
[1:37:11] them adversaries no no
[1:37:13] your ways
[1:37:15] well the devil may no no your ways
[1:37:18] the devil can't make us do nothing
[1:37:21] that's right
[1:37:25] oh sir brother how many times do you
[1:37:27] hear this in the message brother brown
[1:37:28] puts it very clear people say well the
[1:37:30] devil made me go under he said no the
[1:37:32] problem was you weren't sealed in all
[1:37:34] right
[1:37:36] so consider our ways
[1:37:39] i'll tell you
[1:37:40] let's just be honest whether you
[1:37:42] get on the scale and maybe you don't
[1:37:44] ever have maybe you don't have to worry
[1:37:45] about a scale
[1:37:47] or whether you stand in front of the
[1:37:48] mirror sometimes and there's certain
[1:37:49] things in front of that mirror that you
[1:37:51] see you don't like
[1:37:53] but a mirror
[1:37:54] remember as we said here some i don't
[1:37:56] know what service it was a mirror is not
[1:37:58] a picture
[1:37:59] that's
[1:38:00] right that's all right
[1:38:02] that's good
[1:38:04] i mean i can put a picture up there you
[1:38:05] know i could have a big old picture you
[1:38:07] know like they got these you know
[1:38:09] superstar or basketball sir i put it on
[1:38:11] the wall there but it's a picture of
[1:38:13] samuel when
[1:38:15] it was at my best whenever that was
[1:38:17] i had hair
[1:38:19] not see-through hair but i mean i had
[1:38:20] hair
[1:38:22] comb would get stuck in it
[1:38:24] and i looked at jenna said my goodness
[1:38:26] you see the problem of it is that's a
[1:38:28] stationary image
[1:38:30] that's an idol
[1:38:33] and an idol
[1:38:34] doesn't move
[1:38:36] an idol doesn't have ears or eyes
[1:38:40] and an idol has to be packed around
[1:38:44] but my god's not an idol
[1:38:47] hallelujah oh
[1:38:49] my get my dancing shoes on now
[1:38:52] i don't have to pack him around
[1:38:55] but at times when i've needed packing
[1:38:57] he's packed me around
[1:38:59] he's lifting me up
[1:39:02] when i need his strength he's
[1:39:03] strengthened me
[1:39:05] it ain't me packing him he's packing me
[1:39:16] but looking at that picture
[1:39:18] i could look at that picture walk out
[1:39:20] there oh goodness man
[1:39:25] that's good and i'm walking around my
[1:39:27] mind
[1:39:29] is i'm thinking i'm just like that
[1:39:30] picture right there
[1:39:33] and i can still get out there and play
[1:39:34] with the boys
[1:39:42] some of you get there don't worry
[1:39:45] but a mirror is not a picture

[1:40:42] you have sown
[1:40:44] much
[1:40:45] and bring in little
[1:40:48] i want you to listen to these verses you
[1:40:50] have sown much
[1:40:52] these were guys weren't lazy
[1:40:54] they didn't stop working on the temple
[1:40:56] of god and all of a sudden you know
[1:40:57] throughout the 401k put up their lazy
[1:40:59] boy and said we're just going to wait on
[1:41:01] the rapture no that's not what they were
[1:41:02] doing they was already in them to work
[1:41:06] let me tell you something god has built
[1:41:08] every one of us to labor it depends on
[1:41:10] what you're laboring for that's true
[1:41:12] jesus said labor not for the meat that
[1:41:14] perishes amen belabor for that meat that
[1:41:17] cometh from the son of man himself whom
[1:41:20] god the father has healed labor for that
[1:41:23] revealed word labor press in for that
[1:41:26] reality amen because we're going to
[1:41:28] labor for something
[1:41:29] is that right
[1:41:32] you have sown much
[1:41:33] see this is why god would say you shall
[1:41:36] love the lord thy god with
[1:41:38] all
[1:41:39] thine heart soul mind body and strength
[1:41:47] you've sown much
[1:41:49] and bring in little
[1:41:51] you eat
[1:41:52] but you don't have enough
[1:41:54] you drink
[1:41:55] but you're not filled with drink
[1:41:57] you clothe
[1:41:59] but there's none more
[1:42:00] and he that earneth wages earth wages to
[1:42:03] put it into a bag with holes
[1:42:07] what's god letting them know what god's
[1:42:08] trying to say hey your efforts you
[1:42:10] haven't been lazy people
[1:42:14] you've been very fervent
[1:42:16] but you're fervent
[1:42:18] in the wrong things all right that is so
[1:42:20] good
[1:42:22] oh i'm gonna check the ingredients on
[1:42:24] this bread because heaven knows i don't
[1:42:26] want no pesticide in my bread
[1:42:29] that ain't me
[1:42:35] but what about everything
[1:42:37] that you hear
[1:42:42] about everything you give your spirit to
[1:42:44] and your heart to come on friends
[1:42:46] we ought to be checking ingredient
[1:42:48] levels not just looking at saying it's
[1:42:49] bread
[1:42:51] what is that discernment of spirit amen
[1:43:02] verse seven i'm going to come down here
[1:43:05] in just a moment
[1:43:09] thus saith the lord of hosts
[1:43:11] consider your ways
[1:43:12] god didn't forget that he already said
[1:43:14] this
[1:43:15] what's he doing
[1:43:17] he spoke
[1:43:18] now
[1:43:20] what do you see
[1:43:22] this is what i see what do you see
[1:43:25] consider your ways
[1:43:27] you see when the word is coming forth it
[1:43:29] exposes
[1:43:30] brings to view
[1:43:32] brings to light
[1:43:34] and the greatest thing we can do
[1:43:36] is agree with that word and say that's
[1:43:38] nothing but the truth
[1:43:41] amen so amen
[1:43:47] because there is a power in this word
[1:43:50] let me remind you that brother bannon
[1:43:52] tells us in daniel 70 weeks he said they
[1:43:54] wonder why you and i won't go along with
[1:43:58] their denominational schemes and cluck
[1:44:00] up with those hens he said because
[1:44:02] there's been a message that god has
[1:44:05] revealed
[1:44:06] and he said there's a power
[1:44:08] and a vision behind it to get the bride
[1:44:12] in order for the rapture
[1:44:15] this word holds transforming power in it
[1:44:18] amen
[1:44:19] that same transforming power his calls
[1:44:21] out to you and i if you get out of step
[1:44:23] brother carlos brother brother gomez the
[1:44:25] rest of them brothers were in the
[1:44:26] military they know if you get out of

[1:44:42] my goodness i've really went out a lot
[1:44:44] it's a half step
[1:44:47] [Applause]
[1:44:51] glory be to god amen i'm telling your
[1:44:54] friend there's a power right in this
[1:44:56] word
[1:44:57] there's a power in this word of
[1:44:59] transformers a power to lift you and i
[1:45:01] up come on friends we don't need to be
[1:45:03] told how sorry we are we know how sorry
[1:45:05] we are
[1:45:07] come on friends but when conviction
[1:45:09] needs to come to our life we need to be
[1:45:11] people that say god let conviction come
[1:45:14] let my life walk by conviction let me
[1:45:16] walk with real honest reflection
[1:45:22] amen
[1:45:25] notice consider your ways
[1:45:28] go up to the mountain
[1:45:32] now he's given them
[1:45:36] this is the way back
[1:45:38] consider your ways
[1:45:40] and go up to the mountain now in order
[1:45:42] to go up to the mountain you've got to
[1:45:43] turn
[1:45:44] from what you're focused on
[1:45:47] you get turned
[1:45:48] and focused back on the house of god
[1:45:51] see because the house of god needs to be
[1:45:53] built
[1:45:55] our lives are to be built up in the
[1:45:58] things of god
[1:46:00] go up to the mountain and bring wood and
[1:46:01] build the house and i will take pleasure
[1:46:02] in it and i will be glorified saith the
[1:46:04] lord
[1:46:06] verse 9
[1:46:07] you looked for much
[1:46:10] and loit came to live
[1:46:12] and when you brought it home
[1:46:14] i did blow up on it
[1:46:18] why
[1:46:19] saith the lord of hosts
[1:46:20] because of mine house that is waste
[1:46:23] and you run every man into his own house
[1:46:26] i'll just stop there for you
[1:46:32] i'm going to balance this out
[1:46:35] not that it needs balance but what you
[1:46:37] understand
[1:46:39] it isn't that god and i want you to
[1:46:40] listen to me very clearly
[1:46:42] it isn't that god
[1:46:43] these individuals had an eagerness
[1:46:46] towards
[1:46:47] sowing much but reaping little
[1:46:50] you say well
[1:46:51] that means god don't want me to have
[1:46:53] more
[1:46:55] no
[1:46:56] god was letting him know
[1:46:59] he has promises that he's given us
[1:47:03] but if you get the order turned around
[1:47:05] and put the priorities on other things
[1:47:08] and god said i will get your attention
[1:47:10] because my purpose will not be defeated
[1:47:15] god
[1:47:16] knows how
[1:47:17] to get our attention and bring
[1:47:19] correction back
[1:47:21] god's not against and i want you to
[1:47:22] understand hey look
[1:47:24] these guys have preached that prosperity
[1:47:26] gospel watermark you know what they
[1:47:27] preach from they take principles from
[1:47:28] the word of god
[1:47:31] yeah
[1:47:32] you think they're the only ones probably
[1:47:33] i don't know what they drive
[1:47:34] mercedes-benz or whatever more i mean i
[1:47:36] see more mercedes-benz on the roads now
[1:47:38] than i've ever seen
[1:47:40] but see these are scriptural principles
[1:47:42] right
[1:47:44] they tap into those scriptural
[1:47:45] principles
[1:47:47] you see what we're we're tapping into is
[1:47:50] not just scriptural principles but
[1:47:52] there's one objective in the life of the
[1:47:53] believer
[1:47:55] and it's jesus christ above everything
[1:47:57] else
[1:47:59] now i don't want you to get me wrong and
[1:48:01] my boys know they've heard me say this a
[1:48:02] number of times and they we have many
[1:48:05] pow wows not just at home and i don't
[1:48:07] mean powwows like wow wow
[1:48:11] come on ben you can say amen to that
[1:48:13] buddy
[1:48:18] but since these guys
[1:48:21] and all the things they come through
[1:48:23] talk about things
[1:48:24] responsibilities priorities
[1:48:27] listen how much you've got to keep on
[1:48:28] revisiting revisit them depends on which
[1:48:31] one you're talking about
[1:48:33] but all of them
[1:48:34] because when they get to be 18 years old
[1:48:36] or even 16 it isn't like
[1:48:39] checkout time my time is done no
[1:48:42] it's more time for me now than what it
[1:48:44] was before with everyone but brother
[1:48:46] samuel they're right here in the house
[1:48:48] of god
[1:48:51] but leadership is needed that's right
[1:48:54] are you hearing me i'm not going to go
[1:48:55] any further on that this morning right
[1:48:57] let me say any further from me i won't
[1:48:59] be here next sunday
[1:49:01] well if you're not here i'll have
[1:49:02] somebody else step up and preach
[1:49:11] but i've said this multiple times
[1:49:13] i would rather
[1:49:15] my boys
[1:49:16] be full of the holy ghost
[1:49:19] and be janitors not that a janitor is a
[1:49:21] negative thing you understand what i'm
[1:49:22] saying i'd rather than be on fire for
[1:49:25] god
[1:49:27] that's the number one objective
[1:49:29] in my life
[1:49:30] brother samuel how are you going to pay
[1:49:32] for their schooling he's jehovah jihad
[1:49:34] he's already proven that over and over
[1:49:36] again
[1:49:38] what are you saying don't sweat the
[1:49:40] small things we've got a great big god
[1:49:44] who's greater than all those things
[1:49:47] are you hearing me now
[1:49:51] i think i didn't like it when this state
[1:49:52] when they said hey man
[1:49:54] you know paul uh
[1:49:56] ben went in for that college credit plus
[1:49:58] and the state paid for two years two
[1:50:00] years of college and schooling his last
[1:50:02] two years of high school
[1:50:04] i think i mean i don't know if how much
[1:50:06] i dance that's a little bigger that's
[1:50:07] that's some money out of my pocket come
[1:50:09] on friends don't get quiet on me now
[1:50:12] there's some other things that i can you
[1:50:13] know in a different way i appreciate all
[1:50:15] that
[1:50:16] i mean you want to buy me dinner i
[1:50:17] appreciate that too
[1:50:19] now come on now
[1:50:21] but you wonder where am i where am i
[1:50:22] getting back to the priority and the
[1:50:24] focus is
[1:50:26] is i want them to know jesus christ
[1:50:28] i want them to be real men of god that
[1:50:30] are on fire with the holy ghost amen
[1:50:32] they've heard it from me over and over
[1:50:34] of even the things naturally in life
[1:50:36] there's going to be something you have
[1:50:37] to do in life
[1:50:40] whether you don't want to go if it's not
[1:50:42] if it's not college it's a trade that
[1:50:43] you take up we need people in the trades
[1:50:47] i've told them that we've sat down and
[1:50:48] talked but i said you've got to be real
[1:50:52] but the number one thing in your life is
[1:50:54] to be full of the holy ghost and i
[1:50:56] haven't just preached it to him
[1:50:58] i live it right
[1:51:00] i ain't bragging on me you understand
[1:51:02] but to me i want
[1:51:04] that's what my desire is so i say that
[1:51:06] to every parent that's in here the focus
[1:51:08] and the encouragement ought to be in the
[1:51:10] things of god that's true amen help me
[1:51:12] preach brother samuel
[1:51:15] in the things of god that should be the
[1:51:17] number one
[1:51:27] and if my focus is on thine house right
[1:51:31] then i receive the order from thine
[1:51:32] house
[1:51:33] for my house
[1:51:35] and we can stand like joshua and say as
[1:51:37] for me in my house
[1:51:39] we're going to serve the lord amen

[2:01:38] [Music]
[2:01:41] god may you give courage lord
[2:01:44] to hearts and lives this morning
[2:01:48] because every head is bowed i realize
[2:01:50] sometimes
[2:01:51] you know it's been said the longest walk
[2:01:53] that you'll make is the walk from your
[2:01:54] seat to the altar
[2:01:56] well brother samuel that altar itself it
[2:01:58] don't hold any virtue
[2:02:01] i realize that that all that this alter
[2:02:03] itself it doesn't hold any virtue but
[2:02:05] you're not coming here because of this
[2:02:07] altar
[2:02:08] i realize that the altar the prophet
[2:02:10] would say it one way in the revelation
[2:02:12] series it's in your mind where god meets
[2:02:14] you
[2:02:15] then he would come on down paragraphs
[2:02:16] below that and say it's in your heart
[2:02:18] where god meets you
[2:02:20] you see the reason even i know god can
[2:02:22] do things for you sitting right in your
[2:02:24] seat
[2:02:25] but what about courage right now this
[2:02:26] morning sometimes we set upon the things
[2:02:29] of god instead of moving
[2:02:40] i want a refreshing in my life
[2:02:43] [Music]
[2:02:44] lives and hearts that are gathered here
[2:02:46] no doubt some streaming need to be
[2:02:49] filled with the holy ghost
[2:02:51] need a full birth need a full working
[2:02:53] hallelujah maybe lives where you can
[2:02:55] look back and say oh brother samuel five
[2:02:57] years ago but it's not about five years
[2:02:59] ago amen it's not even about last month
[2:03:03] it's about where are you at right now

[2:03:36] just move down in your life you're more
[2:03:37] than welcome to come up here
