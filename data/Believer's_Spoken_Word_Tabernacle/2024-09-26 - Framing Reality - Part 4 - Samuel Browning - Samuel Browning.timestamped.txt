[37:38] still a way maker aren't you Amen in
[37:41] every every part of our life amen God is
[37:45] faithful amen and you know it's like
[37:49] the brother Bram gave us that little
[37:53] point of how great the word of God is he
[37:56] said it's like the the the black brother
[37:59] had said I'd rather be standing on his
[38:01] word than in
[38:03] heaven he said because the Bible said
[38:06] heavens and earth will pass away but my
[38:10] word shall never pass away amen and you
[38:15] know God God makes his word so sure to
[38:18] our hearts just a little bit turn it
[38:20] down just a little to our hearts you
[38:22] know God He makes himself real to you
[38:24] and I I think about it that we can we
[38:28] can set you know as a person as a young
[38:31] person in his presence for many for many
[38:35] times but yet when that strikes our
[38:37] heart and we can recognize what he's
[38:39] done for us in a personal way then
[38:44] things begin to wake up and we can begin
[38:47] to recognize what God has done for us
[38:50] and you know that's the same thing it is
[38:52] with everything in every part of his
[38:55] word as his presence comes by friends I
[38:58] tell you we could be the you might be
[39:00] the sharpest pencil in the box
[39:03] but that's not what God
[39:05] needs God just needs a surrendered
[39:08] vessel because it's him he's the one
[39:11] that's opened our eyes he's the one that
[39:14] that has moved back the Red Sea he's the
[39:16] one that's changed our life amen and
[39:19] that's I'm so thankful for that aren't
[39:21] you I'm glad it's not based on my
[39:24] sharpness or how how intellect or how
[39:27] I'm I'm glad it's just based on him
[39:30] moving in when we can move ourselves out
[39:33] of the way you know how precious that is
[39:36] as we prepare to look into the word of
[39:38] the Lord tonight brother Brian just a
[39:41] little bit
[39:42] more um brother Dave Crest he had
[39:47] surgery there on Tuesday on his knee as
[39:50] many of you know uh he made mention of
[39:53] that at the fellowship dinner or when we
[39:56] were in our service on Sunday and uh so
[40:00] the surgery went extremely well and um
[40:05] he was back at
[40:07] home but they uh took him back in and
[40:11] the hospital today because it just while
[40:13] the healing is going on you kind of need
[40:15] you need the care around you so he had
[40:18] that knee replacement and uh he was
[40:20] already setting up on Wednesday in his
[40:22] rocking chair um but um so he he asked
[40:27] me me to thank you uh even when I was
[40:30] there on Tuesday and then brother Dave
[40:32] Jr we were talking and he has been
[40:35] admitted to the hospital at least to be
[40:37] there for a few days and then to go to
[40:38] rehab for somebody just to kind of care
[40:40] for him because um you know that's a lot
[40:43] with sister Shirley and then brother
[40:45] Dave Jr all them so you know I when I
[40:48] was praying I couldn't help but think
[40:49] about brother Bram talking about a cast
[40:51] being set around a bone he said you know
[40:53] the cast that's not what heals us the
[40:56] doctor can at the bone but it's God that
[40:59] does the healing sometimes we just need
[41:00] the support around us but it's God that
[41:04] does the healing amen so may God help us
[41:07] to be even in our lives to be like a
[41:10] cast that the Holy Spirit can work
[41:12] through for one another that be your
[41:15] desire amen let's just keep brother Dave
[41:18] in in prayer as well and I know there's
[41:20] many other needs too and we want to
[41:23] remember uh sister Stephanie Hannah in
[41:25] prayer as well I know she's doing well
[41:27] but she was in a car accident um my mind
[41:31] slips me that was Tuesday night right
[41:33] was Tuesday night yeah so Tuesday night
[41:36] but um she's doing well so we thank God
[41:39] for that it was certainly the mercies of
[41:41] the Lord and so we thank God uh for that
[41:45] and
[41:46] um we just certainly also U my uncle
[41:50] asked that you would just continue to
[41:52] keep him in prayer as you have been he
[41:53] should be getting transferred back over
[41:56] this way
[41:57] um and he'll be in rehab there for a
[41:59] little bit
[42:01] so uh let's just let's just approach the
[42:05] throne of the Lord once again and
[42:08] Heavenly
[42:10] Father Lord I know that throughout this
[42:13] building

[42:54] Lord father for brother Dave you see the
[42:56] need need Lord in his body as the
[42:59] healing would take place Lord there in

[43:09] and be with those Lord guiding them Lord

[45:08] the Lord Jesus
[45:10] Christ
[45:11] amen and
[45:13] amen amen amen let's go to the
[45:17] scriptures in 1 Chronicles chapter 28
[45:21] and
[45:37] maybe as you're standing there I just
[45:40] wasn't it nice to come in on the parking
[45:43] lot yeah I'm sure the brothers didn't
[45:46] mind about their
[45:48] shoes but uh I know for the Sisters
[45:51] there that was something really
[45:53] special and U I was also told to give
[45:56] you Direction sister Stephanie to make
[45:58] sure you pull up to the parking block I
[46:00] won't tell who told me that but somebody
[46:02] said that in
[46:04] here very dear brother but um I
[46:08] appreciate Brother Carlos and the
[46:10] brothers uh being there to kind of the
[46:12] uh when we put that on on the email uh
[46:15] we don't quite have
[46:17] the the we're using we actually have
[46:20] what was normally before overflow
[46:22] parking where was out right out here
[46:25] well now that's parking lot and and so
[46:27] then eventually their brothers are
[46:28] working on getting overflow for when we
[46:30] have meetings and things like that and
[46:32] for people to park and that's what all
[46:34] that gravel that they pulled back out of
[46:37] here will will go towards and you can
[46:39] see they've already started this but the
[46:41] reason we asked you in here
[46:43] before it's to try to fill this up down
[46:46] in here first um is because everybody's
[46:50] you're always going to be able to get in
[46:52] and out that's one thing that's for sure
[46:54] I know sometimes people would park out
[46:55] here there'd be only three people here
[46:57] and people would be parking out there
[46:59] now I know sometimes we're creatures of
[47:01] habit you know it's like I've got I've
[47:02] got funny little memes where the the
[47:05] church where there's people stacked on
[47:06] top of one another in the back pew and
[47:08] everybody say hey there's room up front
[47:09] you know so I I know we kind of get in
[47:12] habits about things but the reason we're
[47:14] just trying to do that is um because
[47:17] it's a little bit easier to see up here
[47:19] and the brothers will kind of direct you
[47:21] and and if you have to leave early don't
[47:22] worry you're going to be able to get out
[47:24] there there won't we won't have you know
[47:25] a lot of those things down the center
[47:27] like we had before and um I'll go over a
[47:30] little bit more of this in the um uh
[47:32] maybe on Sunday when we have um more
[47:35] here but some of you that have the
[47:37] compact cars I kind of wish I had a
[47:39] compact car because right there in front
[47:41] of those stairs right there those
[47:43] there's where a compact car is and I and
[47:45] probably everybody's thinking about man
[47:46] I knew it was the will of the Lord for
[47:47] me to trade for a compact car but um so
[47:51] we have because those kind of stick out
[47:53] a little bit right there and so we just
[47:55] want to just kind of keep that in mind
[47:57] the brothers will help us and um as soon
[47:59] as we uh have that decided on you know
[48:02] who's going to stripe it for us and
[48:04] things like that brothers are working on
[48:06] uh getting those things and we're going
[48:07] to have that done uh so that'll that
[48:10] would also be kind of helpful as well
[48:12] but um I'm just thankful that we have
[48:16] God has provided us with a nice parking
[48:18] lot amen I want to say God bless you for
[48:20] your amen your sacrifice and giving and
[48:23] and making it all possible because it
[48:25] it's all come from him hasn't it amen we
[48:28] just we so thank the Lord uh I look out
[48:31] there many times and I have to kind of
[48:32] pinch myself I walk out and walk by the
[48:34] window and I take a little break from
[48:36] the office have to kind of pinch myself
[48:38] but I'm just thankful for what God has
[48:40] provided amen verse eight of 1
[48:43] Chronicles
[48:45] 28 uh now watch in the Scripture it says
[48:48] now therefore in the sight of all Israel
[48:50] the congregation of the Lord and and the
[48:52] audience of our God keep and seek for
[48:56] all the Commandments of the Lord your
[48:57] God now I want you to notice those words
[48:59] keep them remember is to observe them
[49:02] but also to seek after them to
[49:05] inquire this is why the when the prophet
[49:08] would say the we can never overemphasize
[49:11] the importance of revelation of seeking
[49:16] after God David wrote of that in Psalms
[49:18] 27 on and on we could we could go with
[49:21] that but that's so important is that we
[49:23] God help us not to lose sight of seeking
[49:26] after him amen amen keep him and seek
[49:30] for all the Commandments of the Lord
[49:32] your God that ye may possess this good
[49:34] land and leave it for an inheritance for
[49:36] your children after you forever and thou
[49:40] Solomon my son know thou the god of thy
[49:43] father and serve him with a perfect
[49:46] heart and with a willing mind for the
[49:49] Lord searcheth all hearts and
[49:52] understandeth all the imagination of the
[49:56] thought thoughts now notice the
[49:57] imagination the framing the putting the
[50:01] Gathering Together of things of the
[50:02] thoughts God under standeth he discerne
[50:07] all of those things I say I want mine
[50:09] discerned I want my life to be discerned
[50:12] I I I want it to be under his
[50:14] discernment and what a privilege that is
[50:16] if thou seek him there it is again he
[50:18] will be found of thee but if thou
[50:21] forsake Him He will cast thee off
[50:24] forever now that word forsake doesn't
[50:26] necessarily mean where you turn and go
[50:27] the opposite way it just means to stop
[50:30] seeking after
[50:32] him oh take heed now for the Lord hath
[50:36] chosen thee to build an house for the
[50:38] sanctuary be strong and do it may God
[50:42] bless you and bless the reading of the
[50:43] word as you're being seated I'm going to
[50:45] keep on reading there if that'd be all
[50:48] right take heed now for the Lord ha
[50:51] chosen thee to build a house for the
[50:53] sanctuary be strong and do it then David
[50:57] gave to Solomon his son the pattern of
[51:00] the porch and the houses and treasuries
[51:03] thereof and of the upper chambers
[51:05] thereof and of the inner parlors thereof
[51:07] and of the place of the mercy seat and
[51:09] the pattern of all that he had by the
[51:12] spirit of the Courts of the house of the
[51:15] Lord and of all the chambers round about
[51:17] and of the treasuries of the house of
[51:19] God and of the treasuries of the
[51:21] dedicated things also for the courses of
[51:23] the priests and Levites and for all the
[51:25] work of the service of the house of the
[51:27] Lord and for all the vessels of service
[51:30] in the house of the Lord we can see
[51:33] within it that God laid sufficient a
[51:37] pattern but it was not a pattern that
[51:40] was just that was something that was
[51:42] devised in the in man's mind remember
[51:46] when God caught Moses up in the cloud
[51:50] God revealed his pattern to Moses and
[51:54] Moses came back down with with that
[51:57] vision and now what was in the
[51:59] heavenlies now became sounded out upon
[52:03] Earth and if God God delivers a message
[52:07] he has lives that are going to receive
[52:11] that word and become what he has spoken
[52:14] as a matter of fact brother Bram talked
[52:16] about of just reading today where those
[52:18] wise men he said they saw that star and
[52:21] he said they had been taught that they
[52:23] were expecting it and he said it passed
[52:26] over many others that never saw it and
[52:29] he said see it just goes to show if God
[52:32] has intended for you to see it you will
[52:35] see
[52:37] itall oh my amen so Brianna go ahead and
[52:41] change it for me I'd like to just speak
[52:43] here once again tonight on this and try
[52:45] to by God's grace this is dangerous to
[52:47] say but try to finish this thought up on
[52:50] framing uh reality and when we look at
[52:54] this of the of the pattern that God God
[52:57] had given and where David here is
[52:59] pulling this from by the spirit he has
[53:03] received this by the spirit it's the
[53:04] same as when God had spoke to Moses and
[53:07] when the Lord spoke to Moses God said
[53:10] let them make me a sanctuary now it was
[53:13] God's pattern but they had to be willing
[53:16] to make the sanctuary or Surrender what
[53:19] was already in their possession and
[53:22] surrender it to him and when it came
[53:24] under the vision and under under his
[53:27] under under his pattern then it there
[53:30] surrendered it became Sanctified it
[53:32] became committed and he took what was
[53:35] already in their possession and now it
[53:38] became uh constructed as a place for God
[53:41] to come down and Tabernacle and dwell
[53:43] among them and I I think that's the
[53:45] greatest thing that you and I are called
[53:47] upon to do God doesn't ask us to go out
[53:50] and get something else or if I can do
[53:52] this and I can be a a better person the
[53:55] only thing that God asked for for is for
[53:57] our lives to be surrendered to him and
[54:00] when it's surrendered to him then God
[54:02] can take what he already knows he's
[54:05] deposited there and he can bring it
[54:07] forth and it becomes a tabernacle that
[54:10] he'll house himself in that his glory
[54:13] would be reflected in a trophy of his
[54:16] unmerited grace so it's according to all
[54:19] the pattern that I show thee so there
[54:22] had to be that of a of a pattern that
[54:24] was revealed and when you think of this
[54:26] with a pattern that has been set before
[54:29] us God laid out everything of every
[54:32] detail in the pattern just like when we
[54:34] were reading this here of how that David
[54:37] was communicating to Solomon it's the
[54:40] same way when God reveals the pattern to
[54:43] that of Moses and I want you to notice
[54:45] in Exodus 25 God's pattern God's pattern
[54:49] he does not begin to release the vision
[54:53] of this of the Tabernacle and work from
[54:56] the outside in but the very first thing
[54:58] that he talks about being constructed is
[55:01] the ark because God deals with the
[55:04] principal part God knows if if he can
[55:07] get the heart right then everything else
[55:10] will come out right because when he sets
[55:12] down there then everything else will
[55:14] begin to take control remember the
[55:16] prophet said when we take the word he
[55:19] said too many do not go clear down to
[55:21] the inside with it they'll only go to
[55:24] the spirit realm but we've got to go all
[55:27] the way down to the inside that's what
[55:30] real true repentance is because real
[55:33] repentance uh is not just I'm sorry
[55:36] because I got caught it's that's not
[55:38] what it is but real repentance is is
[55:41] because Lord I I I forgive me for the
[55:44] wrong that I've done not just for the
[55:46] action but for what is dwelling in my
[55:49] life that would allow that action to
[55:52] come out is everybody with me because we
[55:55] can cut you know it's like it's like
[55:57] weeds you know if you snap that weed off
[55:59] in the flower bed it's going to come
[56:01] back right there you got to get the root
[56:03] of it and this is why when he himself he
[56:06] would come he was the root he was the he
[56:09] was the beginning of the creation of God
[56:12] the author he come to deal with the root
[56:15] of the problem and that was unbelief so
[56:18] to think of how that God would lay would
[56:21] lay this out and what a what a
[56:22] transformation what a condensation that
[56:25] God would lay out this this pattern here
[56:28] from the Tabernacle which ultimately it
[56:31] spoke of you and I it spoke not only did
[56:34] this speak of Christ but this was
[56:37] speaking remember the whole purpose that
[56:40] he became flesh that God the word was
[56:43] made flesh is because God intended for
[56:46] you and I to come back into that place
[56:49] to where his image would be reflected in
[56:52] you and I once again God intended for
[56:55] the work word to become flesh in our
[56:58] life and the only way that could happen
[57:00] is that God himself came down and became
[57:04] our mediator he's came down and he's the
[57:07] one who spanned the breach for you and I
[57:10] he's the one that did away with the
[57:12] chasm he's the one that brought you and
[57:15] I back into that place to where now
[57:17] through the shedding of the blood the
[57:19] Holy Spirit cries out the great Dove of
[57:22] God with the blood dripping from its
[57:24] wings come hither come Beyond the Veil
[57:27] well I'm not worthy no I have made you
[57:29] worthy my blood was shed for you I have
[57:33] made you worthy that I might come and
[57:36] dwell in you that I in you and you in
[57:41] me God's desire that that that would
[57:44] become into that place for him to
[57:46] Tabernacle in a many member body the
[57:49] same life same spirit of God this is why
[57:52] as it started from here God showed with
[57:54] the three room house and God came down
[57:57] and lived in a body of Flesh that he
[58:00] himself created Hallelujah are you with
[58:03] me he knew what it was to get weary he
[58:06] knew what it was to get down the Bible
[58:08] said he was tempted in all points such
[58:11] as we are yet without
[58:14] sin he had to be without sin why because
[58:18] he was the Passover Lamb are you with me
[58:22] so that through the shedding of his
[58:24] blood when you and I would fall fall
[58:26] short there is a blood there is a life
[58:29] that there on the inside that brings you
[58:32] and I back into
[58:35] Fellowship thanks be to God aren't you
[58:38] thankful for that he become our example
[58:41] this is where God became our example of
[58:44] what he intended every son and daughter
[58:46] of God to be God didn't leave it out
[58:48] here where it would just be something
[58:50] that we would have to
[58:53] imagine see they long remember the
[58:55] prophets would tap into and they would
[58:57] tap into this attribute and tap into
[58:59] that attribute this is why when the Lord
[59:01] Jesus stood there he said who do men say
[59:04] that I am some say you're Jeremiah some
[59:05] say Elijah why because he was all of the
[59:09] rainbow right it was Christ in them
[59:12] that's why the Bible said in Isaiah 53
[59:15] he is despised and rejected of men he is
[59:19] he is he was despised and rejected in
[59:23] the ministry of Noah he was despised and
[59:25] reject rejected in the ministry of Moses
[59:28] who was it that was in them
[59:31] Christ who did they follow in the
[59:33] wilderness
[59:35] Christ who was it that equipped them
[59:38] according to all that was given in that
[59:40] time to live a Victorious Life it was
[59:42] Christ who is it that held Moses stable
[59:45] and stabilized his life he endured as
[59:49] seeing him who is
[59:51] invisible this is why he is the
[59:53] stability of Our Lives when we once can
[59:56] catch a glimpse of the Unseen God and it
[59:59] becomes visible it becomes a reality he
[1:00:02] is revealed through his word it
[1:00:04] stabilizes Us in the midst of storms he
[1:00:07] is an anchor the anchor of our soul that
[1:00:11] is within the veil amen like the little
[1:00:14] boy that had that string and had that
[1:00:15] kite and it was a cloudy day and the guy
[1:00:18] walked by and said hey what you got on
[1:00:20] the other end of that kite or the other
[1:00:22] end of that string he said I got a kite
[1:00:23] on the other end of it he looked up and
[1:00:25] he said I don't see no kite all I see is
[1:00:28] clouds he said oh there's a k kite up
[1:00:30] there it's just above those clouds he
[1:00:33] said how do you know that he said cuz
[1:00:34] every once in a while I feel a little
[1:00:37] tug on this
[1:00:39] end aren't you thankful for the
[1:00:43] tug he became our example so much to
[1:00:47] those now born of his Spirit can have
[1:00:51] the same testimony by the same life that
[1:00:54] is he said not mine will
[1:00:56] but thine will be done when he said I
[1:00:59] came not to do mine own will you see
[1:01:01] that that's the whole that's the whole
[1:01:03] whole whole uh uh uh theme of that first
[1:01:07] birth is
[1:01:09] self it's self our first birth it's all
[1:01:13] about self that's the Eve was drawn into
[1:01:16] the place of the Fall because of self
[1:01:19] see here Satan begin to anoint her with
[1:01:23] unbelief and unbelief Drew her to a
[1:01:26] place to look at something above the
[1:01:29] word of God but never are we to look at
[1:01:32] anything above the word of God As a
[1:01:34] matter of fact never are we to look at
[1:01:37] the word of God just straight on but
[1:01:39] always to Humble ourself and come under
[1:01:42] the word that's our god-given
[1:01:45] Authority that's our strength is humble
[1:01:47] ourselves to the word of God that's what
[1:01:49] the Lord Jesus did he humbled himself to
[1:01:52] the Cross is that right he humbled
[1:01:54] himself to the word of God when it came
[1:01:56] time to fulfill the word he humbled
[1:01:58] himself he wrestled it out not my will
[1:02:01] but thine will be done I'm not come to
[1:02:04] do my will but thy will and I can say
[1:02:08] that same life inside of you and I gives
[1:02:10] us a good confidence greater is he that
[1:02:12] is in me than he that's in the world yes
[1:02:15] sir amen now notice how that Paul would
[1:02:19] write this in 1 Corinthians chapter 6
[1:02:23] and he would speak of this what know you
[1:02:26] not that your body is the temple The
[1:02:30] Dwelling Place of the Holy Ghost which
[1:02:32] is in you which you have of God and ye
[1:02:36] are not your own now this this is a
[1:02:39] scripture that I know is all through
[1:02:41] bookstores and every we pretty much got
[1:02:43] this and and memorized but it's a very
[1:02:45] key thing we are not and ye are not your
[1:02:48] own that's a question
[1:02:50] mark do we realize that that we're not
[1:02:53] our own amen yes we've been bought with
[1:02:57] the pr listen not only where we
[1:02:59] purchased from listen now Redemption
[1:03:01] Works to purchase us from the slave
[1:03:06] market and then Redemption goes deeper
[1:03:09] to reconciliation to where it brings
[1:03:12] about a change in our nature to where we
[1:03:15] can never ever be slaves anymore but our
[1:03:19] lives are now yolked with him in a union
[1:03:23] we can never be the same in anymore amen
[1:03:27] we're not our own at one time we were
[1:03:30] moved about by the prince of power of
[1:03:32] the air is that right we were influenced
[1:03:35] we were we were moved in these Direction
[1:03:37] but now to recognize this that that it's
[1:03:41] it's not about me no longer righten and
[1:03:45] I just say it like this that even when
[1:03:46] the Holy Spirit H H how many remember
[1:03:49] when God first got a hold of your life
[1:03:52] remember the tenderness remember the
[1:03:53] sweetness I'm not saying it should be
[1:03:55] brittle and hard that's not what I'm
[1:03:57] talking about now but you remember man
[1:03:59] this everything was my it just seemed
[1:04:01] like the birds sung different everything
[1:04:03] was different it it was like nothing man
[1:04:06] could ever just you know catch in and
[1:04:08] all I mean things were just being
[1:04:09] brushed off but then as things go on a
[1:04:12] little bit with even within our life and
[1:04:14] our journey remember Satan's desire is
[1:04:17] to try to hinder the expression of
[1:04:20] Christ in our lives he would love
[1:04:23] nothing more than to stunt our growth
[1:04:26] and then we find that well wonder why
[1:04:28] this is bothering and wonder why that
[1:04:30] but we remember this is where we come to
[1:04:33] this place that I'm not my own I I could
[1:04:36] do that I could act that way I could
[1:04:39] hold that Grudge but I'm not my own this
[1:04:42] is a temple of the Holy Ghost and God
[1:04:46] gave a pattern of the treasuries and the
[1:04:49] treasuries are where things are to be
[1:04:51] stored I I I don't want the wrong things
[1:04:54] stored up right I don't want the wrong
[1:04:56] thing stored up I I you to say what do
[1:04:58] you mean by that you mean we can strip
[1:04:59] away all of our memories that's not what
[1:05:01] I'm talking about but we can live in
[1:05:03] such a in such a place in Christ to
[1:05:06] where the memories no longer torment
[1:05:09] Hallelujah no longer Drive no longer
[1:05:12] move no longer influence but where the
[1:05:15] very sting within that gate of memory
[1:05:17] has been taken out because there are
[1:05:19] good memories too yes is that right yes
[1:05:25] oh I you are not your own for you are
[1:05:29] bought with a prize therefore glorify
[1:05:33] notice show forth God in your body and
[1:05:37] in your spirit which are Gods now it's
[1:05:39] the soul that he come to redeem that
[1:05:42] will lead to the Redemption of the body
[1:05:44] is that right that's what we're looking
[1:05:46] for the Redemption there of the body but
[1:05:49] it first come what Redemption come for
[1:05:52] is to redeem that soul to claim back
[1:05:55] what belonged to him is that right
[1:05:58] that's what the new birth is about the
[1:06:00] New Birth is about the quickening power
[1:06:02] coming to that soul and that first
[1:06:05] nature dying to self and now the very
[1:06:08] nature of Christ is raised up on the
[1:06:11] inside is that
[1:06:13] right I always think how brother Bram
[1:06:16] you know he would he would put it like
[1:06:17] this he would say you know in the
[1:06:20] message total Deliverance I I love that
[1:06:22] message brother BR said you know he said
[1:06:25] here was the Lord Jesus he said he was
[1:06:28] as much man in his Humanity as he was
[1:06:31] God but he said what he chose to do this
[1:06:35] was to me a powerful statement he chose
[1:06:37] to deliver his natural Parts into the
[1:06:41] hand of almighty God and he said he
[1:06:44] could have been a man for he was a man
[1:06:47] but he chose to completely commit
[1:06:50] himself into the hands of the father
[1:06:52] that's a powerful statement to me he
[1:06:54] could have been a man for he was a man
[1:06:56] you know it's like you or I could say
[1:06:57] well you know I was born this way or I
[1:06:59] was raised in this family you've got a
[1:07:01] choice I've got a choice we've got a
[1:07:03] choice to say well this Browning strain
[1:07:06] or this brown or sthers or whatever as
[1:07:08] it goes through your straight we have a
[1:07:10] choice are you hearing me yes we have a
[1:07:14] choice within that but oh my God God has
[1:07:17] given us Grace to where that you and I
[1:07:19] can actually commit ourselves into his
[1:07:23] hands and I'll tell you friends that's
[1:07:25] not something that's just once at the
[1:07:27] altar it's every moment and every day of
[1:07:30] our life it's when situations arise but
[1:07:34] it must begin most importantly in the
[1:07:36] altar of our heart because that's the
[1:07:38] only way we have
[1:07:40] strength that's the only way we can live
[1:07:42] an overcoming life is when we have
[1:07:44] become part of the word amen are you
[1:07:47] with me that's the only way that's the
[1:07:50] only way to H have a real and an
[1:07:52] overcoming life it's a surrender of our
[1:07:54] will watch how brother Bram would say
[1:07:57] this here I love this he says when
[1:07:59] Christ himself the Holy Spirit comes
[1:08:01] into your heart he is in you with your
[1:08:05] temperament yeah that's good that's good
[1:08:09] is that right yeah brother Bram talked
[1:08:11] about his he talked about and why things
[1:08:14] things that are to be talked about even
[1:08:15] how all the disciples are different God
[1:08:17] did never intend it now listen to me God
[1:08:19] never intended that every one of us was
[1:08:23] going to be exactly alike
[1:08:27] let me just say it like this Oneness
[1:08:30] does not mean sameness
[1:08:32] right that's good everybody with me
[1:08:35] Oneness does not mean
[1:08:37] sameness God the temperament the way God
[1:08:40] has made you sometimes we we we try to
[1:08:43] struggle and we're trying to we're
[1:08:45] fighting against the wrong thing it's
[1:08:46] not something to fight against it's
[1:08:48] yield to the Christ who is in
[1:08:51] you that that's our Victory and then he
[1:08:54] comes down and he lives his own life
[1:08:57] through our temperament you know God's
[1:08:59] made you that way brother Bram talked
[1:09:01] about how remember he had to hit the
[1:09:02] squirrels through the eye and all the
[1:09:04] rest of the brothers were down there at
[1:09:06] the holler and they were down there at
[1:09:07] Sportsman holler just knocking them left
[1:09:09] and right shooting them in the head
[1:09:11] shooting him in side and brother BR says
[1:09:13] he put his gun down against the tree and
[1:09:15] began to cry he says why am I like this
[1:09:18] why did you make me this way they're all
[1:09:20] down there having such a good time but
[1:09:23] he says I'm not able to hit them through
[1:09:24] the ey right now and brother BR how the
[1:09:27] spirit of God came back to him and said
[1:09:29] I've made you that way for a purpose so
[1:09:32] notice God took the temperament but it
[1:09:35] was not the temperament God exalted but
[1:09:38] God took the temperament and he was
[1:09:40] yielded to God and in this age God
[1:09:43] brought a message that had to hit the
[1:09:46] target it was not enough to get ever so
[1:09:48] close it had to hit right on the
[1:09:51] bullseye every single time and if it did
[1:09:55] WR he would say forgive me something's
[1:09:57] wrong something's not right oh oh I
[1:09:59] forgot this is where it's at right here
[1:10:00] something's not right oh you read that
[1:10:01] verse wrong let's read it again had to
[1:10:04] hit the dot Hallelujah why because that
[1:10:07] that is representative of the people of
[1:10:09] the last age of the Bride of Jesus
[1:10:12] Christ The Bride of Jesus Christ is not
[1:10:14] a halfhazard bride it's not just well
[1:10:16] you know God will take this and God will
[1:10:19] accept this and God understands this no
[1:10:21] it's a bride that if he listen now the
[1:10:24] prophet said if if he's hit on 16
[1:10:27] cylinders she must hit on 16
[1:10:30] cylinders is that
[1:10:32] right Same
[1:10:34] Spirit will do the same thing the
[1:10:37] prophet said so yielded you are that
[1:10:41] Christ speaks the kind of words he would
[1:10:44] speak he thinks the kind of thoughts he
[1:10:47] would think through you amen I'd say
[1:10:51] Grant it Lord amen let me be more
[1:10:54] yielded
[1:10:55] because I I can stand here tonight along
[1:10:57] with all the rest of us and say you know
[1:10:59] what that hasn't been
[1:11:03] 100% And you know what let me just say
[1:11:05] it like this my goal and my aim is not
[1:11:08] to be at 100% that every word I speak
[1:11:11] and somehow I've got to spiritualize it
[1:11:13] every thought I think I've got to
[1:11:15] spiritualize it I don't need to do that
[1:11:17] the only thing I have to do is it's let
[1:11:19] him be my
[1:11:21] aim if he's our aim he's our Focus I
[1:11:24] don't have to do nothing I don't have to
[1:11:26] sayoo I feel something right now let me
[1:11:28] I don't have to I can just I can walk
[1:11:30] with him let him be my aim because you
[1:11:32] know what if he's my aim if I get off
[1:11:35] there's something in my heart that says
[1:11:37] that's my Target and I need to adjust
[1:11:40] maybe it's the windage that's off a
[1:11:42] little bit maybe I'm off a little bit
[1:11:44] here but I need to get adjusted and I
[1:11:46] want to be looking at the right target
[1:11:49] hallelujah oh God that's what I want I
[1:11:51] want him to speak the right I want I
[1:11:53] want to speak the words he would speak
[1:11:54] through me
[1:11:56] I want him to think the thoughts that he
[1:11:58] would think through him is that your
[1:12:00] desire he does the kind of works he
[1:12:02] would do through you you are yielded and
[1:12:05] resting oh he said what a beautiful
[1:12:07] picture of a consecrated Christian
[1:12:09] yielded in Christ working through Paul
[1:12:11] said to me to live as Christ and to die
[1:12:14] is gain not me that liveth anymore but
[1:12:17] Christ that liveth in me Christ Living
[1:12:19] oh this is so key in the individual so
[1:12:24] surrendered when Christ speaks through
[1:12:26] the lips thinks through the Mind sees
[1:12:29] through the eye acts through the
[1:12:31] temperaments then the things of the
[1:12:33] world has passed away how can it be
[1:12:36] anything but sweet and pleasant all the
[1:12:38] time Christ has got control that's what
[1:12:41] it is it's Christ in you amen this is
[1:12:45] why brother Bam could tell us that he
[1:12:47] says and over and over in the message
[1:12:49] remember he talks about the dream that
[1:12:51] Joseph how God visited Joseph by dream
[1:12:54] when he was minded to put Mary away
[1:12:57] privately and and here the angel of the
[1:13:00] Lord came to him in a dream and the
[1:13:02] prophet will take that in different
[1:13:04] places in the message and say see that
[1:13:07] only goes to show that maybe if you can
[1:13:09] whistle you can sing you can testify
[1:13:12] whatever it is let it be committed and
[1:13:16] Sanctified to his purpose and he will
[1:13:19] use it for his glory amen that's what I
[1:13:23] want I want everything to be
[1:13:25] Sanctified whatever whatever little part
[1:13:28] that that God that that I'm to play
[1:13:30] whatever it is I want it to be
[1:13:31] Sanctified to his purpose if it's
[1:13:34] ministering the gospel it's not about me
[1:13:36] it's about him if God's called you to
[1:13:38] testify it's not about you it's about
[1:13:41] him God will not share his glory with
[1:13:44] any man if God's called you to sing come
[1:13:46] on friends then we want it Lord I want
[1:13:49] it to be committed to your purpose oh
[1:13:51] brother Samuel my singing is just for
[1:13:53] the Lord then how about using it to
[1:13:55] bless the Saints of almighty God how
[1:13:58] about praying over it and asking God
[1:14:00] instead of saying you know what I I just
[1:14:03] I'm going to hang up my heart on a
[1:14:04] willow tree but Lord this is something
[1:14:07] you placed in my life now maybe maybe
[1:14:10] something has got in the way where
[1:14:12] you've pulled back your talent from
[1:14:15] under his
[1:14:17] presence maybe it's an offense maybe
[1:14:20] it's cares of Life maybe it's
[1:14:23] discouragements maybe it's disp ABY all
[1:14:26] of those things that within the humanity
[1:14:28] that we can experience but oh may God
[1:14:31] help us in this time to realize that we
[1:14:34] are not our
[1:14:36] own do you realize friends one of the
[1:14:38] greatest victories many time you're ever
[1:14:41] discouraged to be delivered from
[1:14:42] discouragement is to pray for somebody
[1:14:46] else that's one of the greatest that's
[1:14:48] one of the greatest victories but so
[1:14:51] many times when we're down we're praying
[1:14:53] God give me strength Lord Lord Lord help
[1:14:55] me to make it Lord help me to put one
[1:14:57] foot in front of the other I'm not
[1:14:58] putting you down friends I've been there
[1:15:00] but I'm saying that one of the greatest
[1:15:02] things is when we can turn from our own
[1:15:04] needs and enter in on behalf of the
[1:15:07] needs of
[1:15:09] others amen I want God to use those
[1:15:12] faculties what however he sees to use it
[1:15:14] this is where Christ he's our absolute
[1:15:17] everybody agree on that Christ is our
[1:15:20] absolute he's the one that he in other
[1:15:22] words it's infalible there's no error
[1:15:24] Christ is our absolute this is what
[1:15:27] we're holding to I want to see what does
[1:15:29] he think what does he see about these
[1:15:31] situations this is why Paul could write
[1:15:33] of it this way and speak to the
[1:15:35] Believers and say let the peace of God
[1:15:39] rule in your hearts to the which you are
[1:15:42] called in one body and be ye thankful
[1:15:46] and let the word of Christ dwell in you
[1:15:50] richly in all wisdom teaching and
[1:15:53] admonishing one another in Psalms and
[1:15:55] hymns and spiritual songs singing with
[1:15:58] Grace in your hearts to the Lord let me
[1:16:00] just tell you the most powerful set of
[1:16:01] teaching is not what we say it's the
[1:16:04] life that we
[1:16:06] live that's the most powerful form of
[1:16:09] teaching there is is a lived image is
[1:16:12] that right now I want you to think of
[1:16:14] this this scripture CU these these two
[1:16:16] scriptures with Paul giving this teer
[1:16:18] Paul did not Paul do not given by
[1:16:21] inspiration to say you know I'm just
[1:16:23] going to take this and and there's some
[1:16:25] you know sorry sorry people that are in
[1:16:28] the the Colossal church and and they
[1:16:30] kind of need this you know there's
[1:16:31] others that don't need this but no God
[1:16:34] God brings his word to admonish you and
[1:16:36] I to see that the mark is set and that
[1:16:40] our eyes would continually be upon the
[1:16:42] mark let me tell you friends I'm not
[1:16:44] trusting in myself I'm not resting in
[1:16:47] myself I I know where I'm standing
[1:16:50] because I'm looking to him and letting
[1:16:52] the word examine my own life not my
[1:16:56] imagination about it but reality when
[1:16:59] reality calls out and says Samuel you're
[1:17:01] not hitting the mark right here Samuel
[1:17:04] you need to pick it up right here that
[1:17:06] is a reality that God brings us to right
[1:17:10] so that we might continue to hit the
[1:17:12] mark want to let the word this these two
[1:17:15] scriptures go hand in hand we want to
[1:17:17] let the peace of God rule in our life
[1:17:20] let let let C how does that rule by
[1:17:23] letting the word of Christ dwell in US
[1:17:25] richly now I want you to think of this
[1:17:27] the Bible here as it says in the
[1:17:29] Amplified it said let the peace from
[1:17:32] Christ rule watch this this is what the
[1:17:34] word rule means in the Greek act as an
[1:17:37] Umpire
[1:17:38] continually what if brother Bram over
[1:17:40] and over give the example in the message
[1:17:42] the absolute he said there's always
[1:17:44] there's an absolute in every in a
[1:17:46] contest right there's people man they
[1:17:48] get upset at the umpires I remember when
[1:17:51] I you know was back back in uh just in
[1:17:53] my young days and we we were watching
[1:17:55] you know some uh I don't know if it was
[1:17:57] what what they call it when they played
[1:17:58] the baseball outside of the season in
[1:18:00] high school but we were there and I
[1:18:02] remember there was this guy it was when
[1:18:04] we were down in Salena and I remember
[1:18:05] this guy he was haggling this R this
[1:18:08] umpire over and over and over and over
[1:18:11] and finally that umpire walked over and
[1:18:13] said get out of
[1:18:15] here they came and got the guy and
[1:18:18] escorted him he didn't want to leave cuz
[1:18:19] one of his sons was playing on the team
[1:18:22] and finally he walked over and said get
[1:18:24] out of here
[1:18:25] because you know why it didn't matter
[1:18:27] what he
[1:18:28] said the Umpire is what had the final
[1:18:32] Authority and that's why it should be
[1:18:35] Christ that has the final Authority
[1:18:37] listen friends it's the very nature of
[1:18:40] Jesus Christ that's been revealed and
[1:18:43] brought before you and I in this hour
[1:18:45] not just a portion not just a sliver not
[1:18:48] just the red light not just a yellow
[1:18:50] light not just an orange light but the
[1:18:52] very fullness of Christ the seals were
[1:18:55] taken off the book The Very nature of
[1:18:59] Christ has come in full View and when I
[1:19:02] turn to see a lion one with authority I
[1:19:06] saw a
[1:19:07] lamb in the mystery of our Authority
[1:19:11] lays in the submissiveness of our heart
[1:19:15] to the word of God that is so
[1:19:17] good Hallelujah Let It Be Where it's
[1:19:21] constantly in our hearts not brother
[1:19:23] Bill what do you think about no no no no
[1:19:25] it's got to there's got to be an Umpire
[1:19:27] in our hearts Brother Ray what do you
[1:19:28] think about no no no it's got to be the
[1:19:30] Umpire inside of us this is why nobody
[1:19:33] else can be your Holy
[1:19:34] Ghost it's got to be the Holy Ghost in
[1:19:37] you this is why the prophet said that
[1:19:40] when that picture I showed you before
[1:19:42] there of in the in the Tabernacle in the
[1:19:45] wilderness The Mercy Seat that was a
[1:19:47] judgment seat of Christ right there then
[1:19:49] it moved into Christ right there at the
[1:19:52] River Jordan and it became AUD judgement
[1:19:55] seat but after the calvary and the
[1:19:57] sending back of the Holy Ghost on the
[1:19:59] day of Pentecost the human heart became
[1:20:02] The Mercy Seat of God once again it
[1:20:05] became the Judgment seat of Christ you
[1:20:07] say what do you mean by judgment seat to
[1:20:09] where that our sins are taken daily and
[1:20:12] if somebody says well I believe God I've
[1:20:15] got the Holy Ghost but it don't condemn
[1:20:16] me to dress like this it don't condemn
[1:20:18] me to do this it don't condemn me to do
[1:20:20] that it shows they're missing the
[1:20:22] Judgment seat of Christ because when the
[1:20:25] word has come in then the heart becomes
[1:20:28] the Judgment seat of Christ and there is
[1:20:31] a condemning if anything is wrong even
[1:20:34] to a
[1:20:37] thought is that right this was God's
[1:20:39] desire you see he said he would be a
[1:20:42] guide he would be a teacher he would
[1:20:44] lead and guide us into all things God
[1:20:46] never gave us the Holy Ghost and said
[1:20:48] all right automatically everything is
[1:20:50] good to go you won't have need of
[1:20:51] nothing no now we take in the word and
[1:20:54] the the word is leading us and guiding
[1:20:56] us and the spirit within us beareth
[1:20:58] witness with his spirit that we're the
[1:21:00] children of God Amen is that right this
[1:21:04] is why within the middle of that umpire
[1:21:06] this is why when everything is going on
[1:21:08] the prophet said hold to that little
[1:21:10] wheel in the middle of the wheel let it
[1:21:14] stabilize every move and every motion
[1:21:18] that you make let it let it be the
[1:21:22] absolute the anchor not not let's not my
[1:21:25] feelings not my past not complexes from
[1:21:30] when I was a young person and you know
[1:21:31] what how you say brother say how do I
[1:21:33] know that I have them complexes when the
[1:21:35] word or something comes across our
[1:21:38] pathway and now there begins to be a
[1:21:41] deviating and now if we're not careful
[1:21:43] we'll make an excuse for something you
[1:21:46] say how do I know when it's not
[1:21:48] according to the word because you might
[1:21:50] have the letter down but if the
[1:21:52] character and the nature is wrong
[1:21:55] then the letter that you're holding to
[1:21:57] you've got the wrong
[1:21:58] interpretation is that right and in
[1:22:01] order for the word to be an absolute the
[1:22:03] UR must
[1:22:05] speak is that right it must speak all
[1:22:08] the way if it don't speak according to
[1:22:10] all the law and Prophets don't believe
[1:22:12] it for there's no light in it how many
[1:22:15] times you and I have had to lay down our
[1:22:17] feelings our thoughts see remember this
[1:22:21] is what God's desire was is to be manif
[1:22:24] ested and manifest his victory and Glory
[1:22:27] through a many membered body my goodness
[1:22:30] God would take a hold of your life and
[1:22:31] my life and he knew what he was getting
[1:22:33] into but you see God's Got Confidence in
[1:22:35] his word that he know he had sown within
[1:22:37] our hearts and God operates and he comes
[1:22:40] through his word he'll never come by our
[1:22:42] emotions he doesn't come through our
[1:22:43] feelings God comes by his word so with
[1:22:46] every situation that we face he comes by
[1:22:49] his word oh my and when he comes by his
[1:22:52] word then there's that part on the
[1:22:53] inside that raises up and said who is he
[1:22:56] that cometh in the name of the Lord
[1:22:58] it'll say raise up those gates open up
[1:23:01] those Gates you see there is a witness
[1:23:04] of
[1:23:05] him oh my through all the pressures and
[1:23:08] everything of life because every one of
[1:23:10] these things come at us is that right
[1:23:12] Temptation ambition Fame trial stress
[1:23:16] all of these things come at us and we're
[1:23:19] not exempt but we want to hold to that
[1:23:23] will in the middle of a wheel right amen
[1:23:26] that's what we want to hold to that's my
[1:23:28] anchor I want to pass all judgment
[1:23:30] through him it'd be like you know when
[1:23:32] when I went to go buy my first
[1:23:34] car huh I had my dad with me I mean I've
[1:23:38] been in a you know I've been a little
[1:23:40] boy and sat over there while they made
[1:23:41] the deals for hours long
[1:23:43] before right I don't know how it was
[1:23:46] going to be I don't know what to look
[1:23:47] for I mean it ain't like you walk in
[1:23:49] there trust in every car salesman like
[1:23:50] they're your best friend and got your
[1:23:51] best interest right if you got a dollar
[1:23:55] on your shoe they'll get
[1:23:57] it I mean they're got they got to make
[1:23:59] their money I I I I get it I we we could
[1:24:02] go on and they could spend a month of
[1:24:03] Sundays on that but my point was is that
[1:24:05] I didn't know I didn't know how to do it
[1:24:08] so I took I took my dad with me once I
[1:24:11] took my dad with me and I ran things by
[1:24:13] him of what I was thinking ran things by
[1:24:15] him well then eventually when I went to
[1:24:16] go buy other cars I could walk in there
[1:24:18] with my spreadsheets already on my phone
[1:24:20] and on my iPad and I said now let's see
[1:24:23] you know how they do I work this is
[1:24:24] going to can you do this payment I
[1:24:26] talking about payments how much are I
[1:24:28] you give me for my car because I've
[1:24:30] already figured out a cost I've got all
[1:24:32] these tabs on interest rates I already
[1:24:34] know brother Sam you didn't oh I did I
[1:24:37] did I I want to know because when I put
[1:24:39] it into my spreadsheet in my budget I
[1:24:41] want to know before I go in
[1:24:43] there
[1:24:44] right that's a separate thing but I I I
[1:24:48] again as that example comes to me that
[1:24:50] you see this is why we don't have to try
[1:24:53] to be big we can say Lord I'm going to
[1:24:55] put my hand in your hand I I don't know
[1:24:58] how to walk through this situation I
[1:25:00] don't know how to face this because
[1:25:01] frankly friends there's some of us all
[1:25:04] the way through we are facing things
[1:25:06] we've never had to face
[1:25:10] before and there's things that if God
[1:25:12] carries we'll face that we've never had
[1:25:14] to face
[1:25:16] before and there's things that maybe
[1:25:18] somebody else has gone through but then
[1:25:20] when it comes time for you and I to go
[1:25:22] through it that's where we have to say
[1:25:24] look Lord I put my hand in your hand
[1:25:26] Lord I I I can't see my way through Lord
[1:25:30] show me Lord thy ways show me how to
[1:25:33] conduct myself Lord guide me in the
[1:25:35] midst of this moment
[1:25:38] Lord I want him to hold my
[1:25:43] hand amen you love him
[1:25:47] Amen Let me just read this quote and
[1:25:50] close I'm I'm not where I wanted to be
[1:25:52] but we'll get there told you that's the
[1:26:00] danger Bram says it like this and is
[1:26:02] your life worthy of the Gospel to me
[1:26:04] this is this is it's just a powerful
[1:26:07] quote I come back to this many times
[1:26:09] brother Bram is talking about how he so
[1:26:11] lived in the word till he became the
[1:26:12] word brother Bram said oh God let me
[1:26:16] hold both of my hands to God before this
[1:26:19] audience let me live like that let this
[1:26:23] word so become that me and this word is
[1:26:28] the same thing Let My Words Be this word
[1:26:34] let the meditation of my heart let him
[1:26:37] be in my heart on my mind tie his
[1:26:42] Commandments upon the post of my
[1:26:46] intelligence tie them upon the post of
[1:26:48] my heart and let me just see Jesus amen
[1:26:52] when Temptation Rises
[1:26:55] let me see Jesus when things go wrong
[1:26:59] let me just see him amen when I get
[1:27:02] ready and the enemy will try to make me
[1:27:04] get angry let me see Jesus what would he
[1:27:08] do he was so much in the word till him
[1:27:12] and the word became the
[1:27:15] selfs
[1:27:17] thing you see this is our
[1:27:20] Victory this this right here is not
[1:27:24] beyond your reach
[1:27:27] tonight it's not beyond our reach
[1:27:30] tonight the key is is as brother Ram is
[1:27:34] asking and praying let this word so
[1:27:37] become that me and this word is the self
[1:27:39] same thing Let My Words Be his word let
[1:27:42] the meditation of my heart let it let it
[1:27:45] so dwell in me remember what God told
[1:27:48] Joshua
[1:27:49] meditate on these things Psalms chapter
[1:27:53] 1
[1:27:54] blessed is the man who does not walk in
[1:27:58] the counsel of the
[1:28:01] ungodly but his Delight is in the law of
[1:28:05] the Lord and in his law doth he meditate
[1:28:09] day and
[1:28:12] night this is this is a victory you see
[1:28:16] we could we could you know it's like
[1:28:18] standing here and saying we shouldn't do
[1:28:20] this and shouldn't do that and and we
[1:28:22] can do that friends we can talk talk
[1:28:24] about even looking at all the different
[1:28:26] attributes of the love of God but you
[1:28:28] know what matters is first of all that
[1:28:30] we have receive the experience of the
[1:28:33] love of God in our soul and then live
[1:28:39] from that
[1:28:40] experience when Moses went with a
[1:28:43] message he went with the
[1:28:46] experience where he had met God at the
[1:28:48] burning bush and that experience had
[1:28:51] loosened Moses from MO Moses and it tied
[1:28:56] him into the word to where when things
[1:29:00] did not go according to how he thought
[1:29:03] remember he got down there and then how
[1:29:05] things begin to happen and he but what
[1:29:07] does he do he doesn't go running back
[1:29:09] out into the Wilderness now he goes back
[1:29:11] to the Lord and he says Lord remember
[1:29:14] when they started saying we're going to
[1:29:15] increase your labors and Bricks without
[1:29:16] straw and all that he runs back to the
[1:29:19] Lord and the Lord speaks to him to do
[1:29:22] what stabilize him stabilize him he's
[1:29:26] got an inner strength I tell you tonight
[1:29:29] that's the most important thing is to
[1:29:31] have the inner strength and to live
[1:29:34] within that word that's why it's so
[1:29:36] important in laying within the message
[1:29:38] of the hour listen if you've not receive
[1:29:40] the Holy Ghost it's so important it's a
[1:29:43] necessity it's not an option it's a
[1:29:45] necessity and I I would just say it in
[1:29:47] this way Lord remedy everything in me
[1:29:51] until it matches what you have have
[1:29:54] called for I I'm going to be like Esther
[1:29:57] I'm not going to take what I think I'm
[1:29:58] going to take what you say Lord I let my
[1:30:02] heart let my heart be in a place of
[1:30:04] complete surrender to the will of God
[1:30:06] let it let it be lined in that way Lord
[1:30:08] listen friends it's not something that
[1:30:10] we have to struggle with it isn't
[1:30:12] something we for us that we have to push
[1:30:14] our way into it's to yield and to
[1:30:17] recognize that God desires to give you
[1:30:19] the Holy Ghost more than you desire to
[1:30:22] receive it amen and then after receiving
[1:30:25] after the Holy Spirit has accepted us
[1:30:29] it's to live in
[1:30:30] him let our lives be regulated by him by
[1:30:35] what by yielding to him how many know
[1:30:38] what that is when you you've read or
[1:30:40] you've heard a message or have you come
[1:30:42] out of a church and here you are going
[1:30:44] maybe the next day or driving down the
[1:30:45] road and youd begin to think about the
[1:30:48] things of the Lord you begin to just
[1:30:49] meditate on him and the things that
[1:30:51] you've heard I mean you can't think on
[1:30:53] something that you ain't heard
[1:30:54] right it's like if I mention brother
[1:30:55] Brian if I mentioned some kind of a car
[1:30:57] to you tonight and we're talk about it
[1:30:59] in the color maybe going down the road
[1:31:01] something you'll see something like that
[1:31:02] it'll stir Oh Brother Sam was talking
[1:31:03] about this certain certain car and this
[1:31:05] color and whatever more it'll stir
[1:31:07] something up but you see that's how when
[1:31:09] God comes by his word the Holy Spirit
[1:31:11] comes listen the word brings the
[1:31:14] atmosphere and all that we have to do is
[1:31:17] step into that atmosphere because that
[1:31:20] atmosphere has been created by the word
[1:31:23] himself and in that atmosphere things
[1:31:26] will take place changes will take place
[1:31:29] our will will be melted to his will
[1:31:31] things that seem so great are melted to
[1:31:34] so little in his presence if the Bible
[1:31:37] says that the mountains in his presence
[1:31:39] are melted like Wax how much more in his
[1:31:42] presence can our will not be melted down
[1:31:46] to his will I say Lord this is this is
[1:31:49] my desire am this reality this reality
[1:31:53] we're talking about Framing and putting
[1:31:55] in perspective I'm not my own I'm not my
[1:31:58] own but neither neither am I a
[1:32:02] hostage to a
[1:32:04] feeling I'm not going to be a hostage to
[1:32:07] a grudge I'm not going to be a hostage
[1:32:10] to somebody who's done me
[1:32:12] wrong I'm not going to be a hostage to
[1:32:15] besetting sin I'm not going to become a
[1:32:18] hostage I'm not going to do
[1:32:20] that now I know I can say that but I
[1:32:24] saying that from from from even in my
[1:32:26] life I trust you can too of where we
[1:32:28] come against pressures or where feelings
[1:32:31] are real but as far as having a right we
[1:32:34] could have a right to hold things are
[1:32:37] you hearing me we have a we could have a
[1:32:40] right and say I've got a right but
[1:32:41] that's true but as a lamb Lord
[1:32:45] sheer I want every minute of my right
[1:32:48] shered I I don't want nothing to take to
[1:32:50] take the Holy Spirit from me I don't
[1:32:54] want I don't want to be where I'm
[1:32:55] walking around with without his presence
[1:32:57] to guide me and Lead me you know friends
[1:32:59] that that's the greatest thing that even
[1:33:01] when you look at listen to me tonight
[1:33:03] maybe in your walk with God you started
[1:33:05] out walking with God and God dealing
[1:33:08] with your life God moving and and here
[1:33:10] you confessed your sins and there's
[1:33:12] things the Holy Spirit begins to take
[1:33:13] out of your life and all of a sudden
[1:33:16] Satan knows if I can just spring this
[1:33:18] trap and then something Rises up within
[1:33:21] you and the dove takes its flight
[1:33:24] because we become a wolf
[1:33:28] again but you know what the prophet
[1:33:30] said all you need to do is become a lamb
[1:33:36] again become a lamb again he'll come
[1:33:39] back he'll come back you see that's
[1:33:41] where when we talk about wherever you
[1:33:43] left him go back to where you left him
[1:33:46] and when you find where you left him the
[1:33:48] death will come back and lead you all
[1:33:51] the way the death left the lamb all the
[1:33:54] way to a Gethsemane not my will thine
[1:33:57] will be done the dove led the lamb all
[1:34:00] the way up Calvary and on that Easter
[1:34:02] morning it was the dove that flew down
[1:34:05] there and resurrected that body on that
[1:34:08] Easter morning and he rose up
[1:34:11] triumphant the Dove came to lead the
[1:34:14] lamb and that same Dove of the Holy
[1:34:17] Spirit has been given to you and I to
[1:34:19] lead us through all the complexities of
[1:34:22] this life through every situation he's
[1:34:26] been called he's been he is our
[1:34:28] comforter to lead us through every
[1:34:31] complex that's ever come about in our
[1:34:34] life he is a faithful guide and he is
[1:34:38] faithful to lead and guide us into all
[1:34:42] truth I believe tonight I'm talking to
[1:34:44] Believers that say
[1:34:46] Lord I don't want to just ask for
[1:34:48] forgiveness for what's wrong but Lord
[1:34:50] let the word go
[1:34:52] down let the word go down Lord let the
[1:34:55] word go
[1:34:57] down let's bow our
[1:35:00] heads Heavenly

[1:35:12] needs Lord I am so
[1:35:15] thankful Lord God for your grace that
[1:35:18] you have given to us Lord in this
[1:35:21] hour how could we even see ourselves as
[1:35:24] we ought
[1:35:25] to if it wasn't for your mercy Lord
[1:35:28] coming by our way Lord to open our
[1:35:33] eyes Lord
[1:35:36] Jesus help us
[1:35:39] father what we're living in a moment in
[1:35:41] a time
[1:35:43] and the Earth the Bible said is groaning
[1:35:46] and
[1:35:48] travailing for the
[1:35:50] manifestation of the sons of God
[1:35:55] earthquakes volcanoes all we see Lord
[1:35:59] the nervous
[1:36:01] tensions that's
[1:36:06] around Lord you can just you can feel it
[1:36:09] Lord You See It Lord among among people
[1:36:13] we see the insanity Lord that's all
[1:36:16] around us things that Lord that would
[1:36:19] never even be considered or entertained
[1:36:23] in the
[1:36:24] mind but we know Lord it has to get this
[1:36:28] way it was prophesied in your word that
[1:36:32] it would be this
[1:36:34] way in that time of your coming Lord Not
[1:36:39] only would there be a coming out as it
[1:36:42] was in the days of
[1:36:44] Sodom but there would be a going in as
[1:36:47] it was in the days of Noah it's a coming
[1:36:50] out of and a going into Lord
[1:36:54] father I pray Lord here this
[1:37:00] evening Lord if there would be one
[1:37:02] that's here under the sound of my
[1:37:06] voice that Lord God in your presence
[1:37:09] would
[1:37:10] be have an honest confession to say
[1:37:15] Lord I want that umpire of the holy
[1:37:18] spirit in my
[1:37:20] life I want that absolute I want the ABS
[1:37:23] absolute of Christ in my life the Holy
[1:37:27] Spirit the love of God dwelling in the
[1:37:30] Judgment seat of my
[1:37:33] heart I wonder as every head is bowed
[1:37:35] and every eyes closed I wonder how many
[1:37:37] would say Lord grant it Lord let my
[1:37:41] heart be that judgment
[1:37:43] seat God bless you God bless your
[1:37:46] hands
[1:37:49] Lord you see father Lord every need
[1:37:52] throughout this
[1:37:53] [Music]
[1:37:54] building Lord
[1:37:57] now we and ourselves
[1:38:00] lord I can't remedy and Lord bring
[1:38:05] anyone else's heart or my heart but
[1:38:08] father we can look to you and by Your
[1:38:10] Word when Lord it was such a Gloom and a
[1:38:13] darkness that was over the face of the
[1:38:16] Earth void and without darkness and with
[1:38:21] Darkness you spoke
[1:38:24] and your word went
[1:38:28] forth let there be
[1:38:30] light the word
[1:38:33] changed the
[1:38:35] conditions it changed the
[1:38:38] atmosphere that was around the
[1:38:40] earth there begin to be a a breaking
[1:38:45] forth of the shakina light that Lord
[1:38:48] would move and press back lord God the
[1:38:51] darkness where it would have to give way
[1:38:53] Lord
[1:38:55] and then father to lead and bring this
[1:38:59] earth right over around the
[1:39:02] Sun and as your Prophet said it would
[1:39:04] become a beautiful watered Garden of
[1:39:09] Eden because it obeyed the word of the
[1:39:13] Lord father right here tonight
[1:39:17] Lord God as your word has gone forth I
[1:39:21] pray father as hearts and lives that
[1:39:23] Lord desire that you would be the
[1:39:26] completeness Lord in their lives maybe
[1:39:29] Lord God I know throughout this building
[1:39:30] we all would desire Lord more of you
[1:39:33] amen but I also know Lord there's others
[1:39:35] that say I want to receive that portion
[1:39:39] of my inheritance I want to receive that
[1:39:42] deposit that God has for me that deposit
[1:39:44] that I've been longing for that desire
[1:39:47] that I can live a real Victorious
[1:39:50] Life and have the rulership of Christ in
[1:39:52] my life with a love affair where it's no
[1:39:56] longer a law but it's a love affair from
[1:39:58] the Throne of my heart father I pray in
[1:40:02] the name of Jesus Christ Lord God
[1:40:06] whatever spirit that Lord would want to
[1:40:09] hinder and hold back lord as a Gloom
[1:40:11] Lord father I place the name of the Lord
[1:40:14] Jesus Christ against Lord that habit
[1:40:18] against that Spirit Lord that father the
[1:40:21] word of God might find its resting place
[1:40:25] in the heart of your daughter of your
[1:40:29] son because Lord it belongs to them your
[1:40:33] Prophet said you knew we would be here
[1:40:36] and we would be
[1:40:38] Desiring the Holy
[1:40:40] Ghost so he said God you put me in this
[1:40:43] pull pit tonight to preach this word
[1:40:46] that would be
[1:40:47] delivered and here you are to release to
[1:40:51] them the desire that you already seen
[1:40:54] before the foundation of the world thank
[1:40:57] you Father for your mercy for we're not
[1:41:00] standing here Lord God as poppers as
[1:41:03] Beggars we're not standing here as
[1:41:05] slaves but God your word has come to let
[1:41:08] us know you are Sons and Daughters of
[1:41:11] mine this is the love that I have
[1:41:14] bestowed upon
[1:41:17] you that you should be called known as a
[1:41:22] son and daughter of God
[1:41:24] approach my promises as a son and
[1:41:26] daughter of God these are your
[1:41:29] Redemptive
[1:41:30] rights granted Lord tonight I
[1:41:33] pray Lord God May the Holy Spirit just
[1:41:36] continuing to move Lord God lord even as
[1:41:39] Lord Jesus throughout Lord the oncoming
[1:41:41] moments and hours Lord even through the
[1:41:43] night Lord oh God may you move Lord I
[1:41:46] pray God in lives and hearts Lord that
[1:41:49] father in sincerity Lord have been open
[1:41:53] to
[1:41:54] you now
[1:41:56] [Music]
[1:41:58] Lord like your Prophet when he spoke
[1:42:02] that Lord at the end of that message and
[1:42:04] is your life worthy of the
[1:42:07] Gospel all of us Lord can say Amen to
[1:42:10] that let me so live in that
[1:42:15] word I realize Lord that there's
[1:42:19] theologians that can live in the print
[1:42:22] the letter
[1:42:24] and really not be living in the
[1:42:26] word now it's important Lord that we
[1:42:29] would give ourselves to the word of God
[1:42:32] when the prophet was asked simple
[1:42:36] question how do I get closer to
[1:42:39] God he said read your Bible and
[1:42:44] pray
[1:42:46] Lord very simple
[1:42:50] directions but that's just like you Lord
[1:42:54] you haven't called for anything to be
[1:42:56] some high fute and something
[1:42:59] Lord as I just heard your Prophet Lord
[1:43:02] speaking even today when he was once
[1:43:04] again nailing down that Hollywood
[1:43:07] evangelism dealing with things that
[1:43:09] becomes so
[1:43:11] flashy like a show but he said that's
[1:43:13] not how God dwells God dwells in
[1:43:19] Simplicity
[1:43:21] Lord as we would read and as as we would
[1:43:24] pray giving ourselves Lord to you Lord
[1:43:27] as we're sitting and listening to the
[1:43:29] word oh
[1:43:31] God tie it Lord tie it like the prophet
[1:43:34] said tie the
[1:43:35] Commandments on the tie poost of my
[1:43:39] mind when Temptation arises let me see
[1:43:43] Jesus when things go wrong because
[1:43:46] things do go wrong Lord I don't want to
[1:43:48] go wrong with
[1:43:50] it let me see Jesus amen
[1:43:55] Lord God he said when the enemy comes
[1:43:57] along and tries to make me get angry let
[1:44:01] me see
[1:44:03] Jesus oh
[1:44:05] God granted Lord that's my request Lord
[1:44:09] that's the request Lord of your children
[1:44:12] tonight Lord as we've gathered
[1:44:14] here that you be the centner
[1:44:17] Lord of every decision of every thought

[1:44:52] to letting the Peace of of God rule in
[1:44:53] our lives let the word dwell in US
[1:44:57] richly let it be the influence in our
[1:45:01] life when a thought or something Lord
[1:45:03] that comes our way and Lord there's a
[1:45:06] lot of things that come our way but may
