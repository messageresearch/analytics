[28:26] the high mind and the wisdom of this
[28:28] world
[28:29] and it comes in such simplicity amen and
[28:32] if you know if it wasn't for the grace
[28:34] of god
[28:35] you and i would have missed it the
[28:37] brahman said if the word did not become
[28:39] flesh he said it would have blinded the
[28:41] very land
[28:42] to see god god his word becoming flesh
[28:45] is that that light
[28:46] itself would shine and it would reach
[28:48] our lives
[28:49] to unveil god to us now it's not just
[28:53] god unveiled to us
[28:54] it's god and being unveiled in us amen

[31:52] leading and direction here tonight
[31:54] we love you and we thank you father in
[31:56] the name of jesus christ
[31:58] amen let's look here in first
[32:01] corinthians
[32:02] chapter 13 verse 4 we'll just read that
[32:04] verse of scripture
[32:06] and we'll just let you have your seats
[32:11] we've been looking here in in parts
[32:13] within this
[32:15] particular scripture or the scriptures
[32:18] in this chapters is dealing with
[32:21] charity which is the love of god it's
[32:23] god's own life
[32:25] and here as paul would write charity
[32:29] suffereth long and is kind
[32:32] charity envieth not and we've looked at
[32:35] this
[32:36] for some weeks on that part on envy if
[32:38] not
[32:39] and envy is where one could look at
[32:42] someone else and be
[32:43] jealous whether it be gift or whether it
[32:45] be something
[32:46] in their life or or in something in that
[32:49] measure and then now the next part that
[32:51] we would look at
[32:53] is charity vaunteth not itself
[32:56] and is not puffed up so instead of
[32:59] looking at someone else or looking at
[33:01] something else but this
[33:03] another another part of it that paul
[33:04] would write of what charity
[33:06] is not is that which would try
[33:10] to bring itself up or make itself
[33:13] something that it's really not
[33:16] so it's it's such a it's a contrast of
[33:18] that of of
[33:19] envy but yet it still is under the same
[33:22] operation and this is one of those other
[33:24] parts that paul is dealing with of what
[33:26] charity
[33:27] is not may god bless you bless the
[33:29] reading of the word as you're being
[33:30] seated
[33:32] we we look at this and in the in the
[33:36] amplified bible that latter part
[33:38] it deals with what we wrote or what
[33:40] we've read
[33:41] charity vaunteth not itself and is not
[33:44] puffed up it
[33:45] says it's not boastful or vain
[33:48] glorious it does not display itself
[33:52] heartily this word vaunteth that's used
[33:56] here
[33:57] it deals with that which a very simple
[34:00] term would be
[34:01] that of a braggart one who brags
[34:04] or who makes things known you know the
[34:06] scripture is very clear it says
[34:08] let not the left hand know what the
[34:10] right hand is doing
[34:12] there's things that that were in reality
[34:14] when we
[34:15] look at this and how god would would
[34:18] show and would would teach us
[34:20] these things of how that god many times
[34:24] he visits our life
[34:25] and god will speak to us and things that
[34:27] god would even
[34:29] use us in a in a way and in a measure
[34:32] and and part of that being used
[34:34] is also to test and see if he's going to
[34:37] be able to further use us
[34:39] because if him using us and it's truly
[34:42] let me just say it like this
[34:44] it's a very it's a glorious thing
[34:47] to be used of god it's a tremendous
[34:49] thing as
[34:50] many times that you step back and you
[34:52] realize
[34:53] that it was it was sometimes there's
[34:55] things that
[34:56] you maybe were saying or doing or maybe
[34:59] you were praying for someone
[35:01] you didn't feel anointed you didn't even
[35:04] feel like you had
[35:05] my that these were such great words it
[35:07] might have been that you were
[35:08] fumbling with your words and you might
[35:10] have left out of there and thought
[35:11] my i i certainly wish i would have had
[35:14] better words
[35:15] but yet god himself you'll find that
[35:18] maybe he moved in that situation and he
[35:20] moved in that way
[35:22] and god would move in that manner
[35:24] because it would be something that you
[35:26] or i
[35:27] would not in any way think and we would
[35:29] recognize my what i thought
[35:31] what i thought was going to come out or
[35:32] might be how i felt i maybe didn't feel
[35:35] worthy
[35:36] but god would move in such a time as
[35:38] that
[35:39] and then the test would be to come after
[35:42] that what are we going to do
[35:44] with it you know when i was there i
[35:46] think when i was here
[35:47] within um uh in jeffersonville
[35:51] there this past um july i think it was
[35:54] was it honey was it july or
[35:56] august i don't even remember what month
[35:58] it was because it was such a blur within
[36:00] those times but
[36:01] you know one thing that i can i can say
[36:04] that one thing that the brothers when
[36:05] they we were going around
[36:07] and you'll hear brother branham even on
[36:09] tape you never hear
[36:11] you don't hear brother branham telling
[36:13] about the things that was done in the
[36:15] meeting
[36:15] unless it maybe would be something that
[36:18] god would
[36:18] would somewhat inspire of brother
[36:20] branham to say but you don't find
[36:23] him and brother brown would even say i
[36:25] don't even you know go about in telling
[36:27] the things that are done
[36:29] because we recognize it's god will share
[36:32] his glory
[36:33] with no man and if our desire
[36:37] our desire as i said moments ago it's a
[36:40] glorious thing to be used of god
[36:42] and let's just be honest with one
[36:43] another even those times when you've
[36:45] prayed for someone god maybe has used
[36:47] you to
[36:48] express a word or something or whether
[36:50] it feels good to be used by god
[36:52] but it's something that we must always
[36:55] keep in mind
[36:56] that it that it did not come because
[36:59] that we
[36:59] were something or somebody or even that
[37:02] we were to in turn
[37:04] share that with somebody else because
[37:06] when
[37:07] god's not obligated to use us over and
[37:10] over and over
[37:11] as a matter of fact brother branham
[37:13] would tell us that sometimes even when
[37:15] it comes
[37:15] to the nine spiritual gifts brother
[37:17] braham says everyone
[37:19] who is born of the spirit is subject to
[37:22] any of the nine spiritual gifts
[37:23] at any time and he says they mill that's
[37:26] the terminology brother brown would use
[37:28] they mill throughout the body he said
[37:31] god might use this one tonight
[37:32] and may never use this person again so
[37:35] we just it you know
[37:37] the reality is is we're just thankful
[37:39] that god just to be a part
[37:41] of the economy of god and that god would
[37:44] use us and you know
[37:45] the real reality of it is is that those
[37:48] that maybe have been used in the
[37:50] greatest way
[37:51] no one knows about it and that's great
[37:56] because god does not and he will not
[37:58] share his glory
[37:59] with any man god does not let me just
[38:02] say it like this god does not want
[38:04] you or i looking after any man as though
[38:07] oh if i can just talk to this man
[38:09] if i can just go sit down in this
[38:11] person's living room
[38:12] god doesn't want us to look into man
[38:14] that way he wants us to recognize
[38:16] he's the great one in our midst and god
[38:20] does not want even for that that that's
[38:22] not
[38:22] even something that god would put upon a
[38:25] person
[38:26] god desires that all adoration all
[38:29] worship would go to him even when they
[38:31] come to the lord jesus and said
[38:33] good master and he said why call us thou
[38:37] me good there is one good
[38:40] worship him and that is god you see to
[38:43] recognize that it's
[38:44] god who is in our midst and so when we
[38:48] we think of this term
[38:50] of vaunteth it's not boastful or
[38:53] vainglorious or of
[38:54] empty glory it's this word it deals
[38:58] to boast oneself a self-display
[39:01] employing radical uh radical uh
[39:05] embellishments
[39:06] installing oneself excessively
[39:09] you know perhaps that each and every one
[39:11] of us and i'll
[39:12] i just say depending on our makeups and
[39:15] how we are
[39:16] but i could say that we probably each
[39:18] and everyone could share
[39:19] we've been around people that where
[39:21] maybe they talk
[39:23] and everything you would think that they
[39:26] ate donuts
[39:27] with the angels are you with me
[39:30] it was though that as everything is oh
[39:32] this is this and this and this and this
[39:35] and it would be in that manner now
[39:37] there's a lot of things that we could go
[39:38] into that sometimes
[39:40] that it isn't that god doesn't visit
[39:42] people we understand that he doesn't
[39:44] he does visit us but we're also very
[39:46] much aware of these things and we know
[39:49] that within it of how that you know
[39:52] it should never be that we are drawing
[39:55] attention to
[39:56] self but it's drawing attention to
[39:58] almighty god
[40:00] this is why brother rahm said when
[40:02] you're choosing a pastor for the church
[40:04] do not choose a man who is of reputation
[40:07] but choose one who has no reputation
[40:11] choose one that because then
[40:14] that man that individual is his desire
[40:18] is to serve god to serve that of the
[40:20] word
[40:21] serving the people he doesn't have a
[40:23] reputation that he has to keep up
[40:26] and so here you find in the scripture it
[40:28] goes on to say
[40:30] of this uh of the word and it's not
[40:33] puffed up
[40:33] and you know you think of that puffed up
[40:36] forgive me but the only thing i always
[40:38] get in my mind is i've looked over this
[40:40] is you know those puffer fish
[40:42] when they get into a state and you know
[40:45] somebody's coming after them and
[40:47] it's offending them and
[40:50] why does it do that it wants to make
[40:52] itself bigger
[40:54] to intimidate the opposing force
[40:57] but you see that's contrary to the
[41:00] kingdom of god
[41:02] the kingdom of god is not that we puff
[41:04] ourselves up to make ourselves
[41:07] bigger because in reality that fish
[41:10] didn't get any bigger
[41:11] it only got more full of air and so to
[41:14] be puffed up
[41:15] is to become full of a lot of hot air
[41:19] are you with me you see this is why it
[41:21] says to make proud or
[41:23] to bear oneself lawfully to be proud and
[41:26] and i thank god for his mercy that no
[41:29] matter
[41:30] let me just say it like this no matter
[41:32] where we've come from in our backgrounds
[41:34] because
[41:35] we recognize here tonight that there's
[41:38] not one of us that can say
[41:40] well i come out of a perfect home i had
[41:42] a perfect father i had a perfect mother
[41:44] not one of us can say that because
[41:47] there's one perfect parent and that's
[41:50] the lord jesus christ
[41:51] and every parent that is filled with the
[41:54] holy ghost
[41:54] it looks to him god that you would guide
[41:57] me even as a parent you would direct me
[42:00] but we recognize not just in parenting
[42:02] but even as a believer in christ
[42:05] that we are to reflect and look and to
[42:07] look into the word
[42:09] and see because the word will show our
[42:11] weaknesses
[42:12] it'll show where we're lacking and when
[42:14] it shows that then the desire is lord
[42:17] let me just yield to myself lord mold
[42:20] and make me because
[42:22] remember the bible said whosoever
[42:24] looketh into the perfect law of liberty
[42:26] you cannot look down on the word the
[42:29] bible says looketh into and that
[42:31] scripture
[42:31] that word means one who crouches down to
[42:34] see
[42:35] something that is so low you see the
[42:38] word has a way
[42:39] when it's coming forth and it's and it's
[42:42] actually being ministered
[42:43] it does not it's not so much where it's
[42:46] causing us to
[42:47] be puffed up but it brings us down into
[42:49] a place of humility to be able
[42:52] to look in and to see the true riches
[42:55] and the character
[42:56] and the nature of god you know what's
[42:58] happening there's a humbling that's
[43:00] going on
[43:01] even in our heart to say be it unto me
[43:04] lord
[43:05] according to that word we never want to
[43:07] vaunt ourselves
[43:09] or lift ourself or as it says in first
[43:11] thessalonians 4
[43:12] that the man of sin setting he said in
[43:15] the temple of god as
[43:16] he is god exalteth himself above all
[43:19] that's called god
[43:20] that's the very precept of the world
[43:24] of the religion of babylon of every
[43:26] system of man
[43:28] that's the very precept of it so
[43:31] when paul would deal with this i want to
[43:33] just maybe take this approach in and how
[43:35] the lord would just just lead this
[43:37] tonight as we look at this that what
[43:39] charity
[43:40] is not and paul when if we look at this
[43:43] and we remember that
[43:44] the charity itself that paul is speaking
[43:47] of he's speaking of god's own life he's
[43:49] speaking of god
[43:51] he's speaking of the very nature of god
[43:54] and
[43:54] paul is not just he's not writing or
[43:57] speaking to them
[43:59] in terms of of something that he doesn't
[44:02] know about or what he's read about
[44:04] but paul's expressing of what he knows
[44:07] by an experience because you see this
[44:10] was a man
[44:11] right here that god took a man who knew
[44:14] multiple languages
[44:16] he was a pharisee of the pharisees
[44:19] he was one that was very paul was
[44:23] as a very as brother branham would put
[44:24] it an intellectual servant of god
[44:27] paul was very astute he he knew
[44:30] many things but you see in order to know
[44:33] god
[44:34] he had to be willing to loose himself
[44:38] from everything that he ever knew and
[44:41] become yoked and
[44:43] tied into christ you see
[44:46] now it wasn't just that he knew the law
[44:49] he knew all these things he knew that
[44:51] before
[44:52] but now he and there was an experience
[44:55] that unfolded what the word had spoke of
[44:59] and through all the time it unfolded the
[45:01] very character
[45:03] and the heart of almighty god this is
[45:05] why paul
[45:06] could write if i can say it in this way
[45:08] he's writing of the coming of the lord
[45:11] and how that the coming of the lord was
[45:13] so great
[45:15] it was so great but it was not great
[45:18] in the way that men and people look at
[45:21] it
[45:22] it was it came in a way that was
[45:24] despised by the world
[45:26] but yet it was a great way how god came
[45:30] he came
[45:31] in such simplicity to think of it you
[45:34] know i couldn't help
[45:35] but thinking of the words of this song
[45:38] that we sing brother branham he loved
[45:40] this song and he would have you know uh
[45:43] brother booth clyburn to sing the song
[45:46] over and over down from his glory
[45:49] and to think of the of this of the words
[45:52] what condensation
[45:55] bringing us redemption that in the dead
[45:58] of night not one faint
[46:00] hope in sight but god gracious
[46:04] tender laid aside his splendor
[46:08] stooping to woo to win to save
[46:12] my soul oh how i love him
[46:16] how i adore him my breath my sunshine
[46:20] my all in all the great creator
[46:23] became my savior
[46:26] and all god's fullness dwelleth in him
[46:32] god let him know in isaiah 7 14 of his
[46:35] coming
[46:35] therefore the lord himself shall give
[46:38] you a sign
[46:39] behold a virgin shall conceive and bear
[46:42] a son
[46:43] and shall call his name emmanuel
[46:47] you see we hear over and over
[46:50] it's true what man calls great
[46:54] god calls foolish and what man calls
[46:58] foolish
[46:59] god calls great let me just tell you the
[47:03] those who have been really connected
[47:05] with god
[47:06] down through the ages have been
[47:09] considered
[47:10] as fools or nuts
[47:13] or crazy people they've been considered
[47:17] in a way
[47:18] that well if god surely was going to
[47:20] speak or to say something
[47:22] he would come our way he would come
[47:24] through us i want you to think of this
[47:27] that even every time when god would send
[47:30] his message of deliverance through noah
[47:33] through moses
[47:34] through abraham on and on we could go
[47:37] and yet you would find
[47:38] that there were people who would stand
[47:41] against that word
[47:42] there were men of great intellect great
[47:45] men
[47:46] of great renown take moses for example
[47:49] god took moses in the backside of the
[47:51] desert
[47:52] and for 40 years he took out or
[47:55] unpacked everything that egypt had
[47:58] packed into him
[47:59] in order to bring him into a place of
[48:02] complete
[48:03] humility a place to where that god could
[48:06] then make himself known to moses
[48:09] and moses would even would even look at
[48:11] himself and say
[48:13] i'm not even fit for the job i i can't
[48:15] even talk right and
[48:17] and all of these other things but god
[48:19] had him in a place that he wanted him in
[48:22] because the place that god wants every
[48:24] one of his children in
[48:26] is in a place of humility where they
[48:29] recognize
[48:30] i can't do this on my own i can't even
[48:33] do it
[48:34] lord i need you and i need you every day
[48:37] lord
[48:38] i need you every moment of my life god
[48:41] brings us into those places to think
[48:45] every time it's been god will allow the
[48:48] schools
[48:50] of thought and intellect of man to go
[48:53] forth and and take promises like we just
[48:56] read here
[48:56] in isaiah brother brown tells us that
[48:59] many
[49:00] of the young girls they would they would
[49:02] grow throughout
[49:03] am i that young lady am i that young one
[49:06] many of them were looking
[49:08] many of them were watching but you
[49:10] recognize there was
[49:12] a predestinated womb there was one
[49:15] in whom this word was speaking of and
[49:18] when it was spoken
[49:19] to think how god would move in such a
[49:22] way
[49:22] and how it would come about they could
[49:24] read it but they didn't understand it
[49:26] and when it did come to pass they here
[49:30] because they were so blinded by the
[49:33] theology
[49:34] by all of that where men had taken the
[49:36] word
[49:37] and when man get a hold of the word
[49:39] listen to me now
[49:40] when man gets ahold of the word he
[49:42] explains away the supernatural god
[49:46] and if you take the supernatural god
[49:49] away from the word you've got nothing
[49:51] but a dead letter
[49:52] this is why the word apart from the word
[49:55] himself
[49:56] is nothing but a dead letter but it
[49:58] takes the word himself
[50:00] the holy ghost to get in the word and
[50:03] then the word becomes a living word
[50:05] it becomes a word that discerns the
[50:07] thoughts and intents of the heart
[50:09] it becomes a word that reveals itself as
[50:12] a mighty one
[50:13] as a deliverer as an overcomer
[50:17] the letter killeth but the spirit gives
[50:19] life
[50:22] when he came satan made sure
[50:28] after this come about and this man here
[50:31] is mary
[50:32] she's with child the holy ghost has
[50:36] overshadowed her
[50:37] this is god's super sign but yet
[50:41] the name that the devil places upon it
[50:45] is
[50:46] he is the son of
[50:49] a drunken roman soldier
[50:52] who ravished this girl
[50:57] are you with me
[51:00] and god didn't try to do anything about
[51:02] that either
[51:04] let that sink in god didn't make videos
[51:07] on it
[51:08] let me prove why this he didn't do that
[51:12] that's the world there are those who
[51:15] fall
[51:15] under that in the world but it didn't
[51:17] matter of all the lies
[51:19] the debauchery it didn't matter how many
[51:21] called him beelzebub and
[51:23] this and that that didn't matter you're
[51:25] not going to stop the elect from the
[51:27] light of god
[51:29] reaching their life i don't care how
[51:32] much of a bad name
[51:33] and a black mark and once you try to lay
[51:36] on it you can't stop the power
[51:38] of the revealed word
[51:43] hallelujah let satan try to puff himself
[51:46] up
[51:46] but you cannot fort nor stop the power
[51:50] of this word it comes in such humility
[51:53] it was god's super sign let me just move
[51:56] ahead quick and then we'll come back
[51:58] in this hour revelations 10
[52:02] the opening scripture says and i saw
[52:05] another mighty angel
[52:08] it's a coming that's the angel of the
[52:10] lord that's the fullness of the holy
[52:12] ghost
[52:13] that's christ himself descending with
[52:15] the little book
[52:16] this is a book of redemption this is
[52:18] this is a word
[52:19] that is sent to call the elect of god in
[52:22] finishing up
[52:23] in this hour notice a mighty angel but
[52:26] yet
[52:26] to the world if we look at it in terms
[52:29] of the carnal mind
[52:30] it looks like wow it's something great
[52:32] that's out there
[52:33] it'll reach to the nerve centers my
[52:35] everybody will want it
[52:36] no it must follow and it will go
[52:39] according to
[52:40] everything in the past it is despised
[52:43] and rejected it comes in such
[52:47] humility the mighty god the great coming
[52:51] of the holy ghost
[52:52] in his fullness and yet the world writes
[52:54] it off
[52:56] men can look and say well you know
[52:58] brother branham you know he's a prophet
[53:00] and while we're looking at this you know
[53:02] just seeing him and just saying the clip
[53:03] here the other day
[53:04] you're a man he's looking at the sixth
[53:06] vision he's
[53:07] man's not even a believer as far as what
[53:09] we follow but you're aware of that sixth
[53:11] vision
[53:12] and brother branham says in there he
[53:13] says i see a great woman rising to power
[53:16] a few weeks ago you know i hear him at
[53:18] home and and a brother sends me a text
[53:20] and he sends me
[53:21] the text another pastor and he sends me
[53:23] the text and he sends me the picture
[53:27] of the inauguration and here you find
[53:29] the the person
[53:30] in the office of vice president standing
[53:33] there in the very dress color
[53:35] that the prophet saw her standing in he
[53:37] said i seen her standing there
[53:39] in a deep royal purple
[53:44] tell me what anybody else has on that
[53:47] tell me what other organization or
[53:49] other thing can say that
[53:51] [Applause]
[53:53] he said i saw that woman
[53:57] it's all tied in now look this
[53:59] individual said well you know
[54:01] i this could be i i really think you
[54:03] know this could be and then he goes into
[54:05] the
[54:05] part of the seventh vision where the the
[54:08] the the uh
[54:09] the nation is laid in ashes and i don't
[54:10] want to preach on that tonight but
[54:12] to look at where many will say he's a
[54:15] prophet
[54:16] but you see the reality is is they don't
[54:19] recognize
[54:20] really what a prophet is sure prophecy
[54:23] visions
[54:24] sure the prophets they god shows them
[54:27] things
[54:27] but a prophet is one whom the word
[54:31] of the lord comes to
[54:34] this is why it's not enough with just
[54:37] the bible
[54:38] [Music]
[54:39] you've got to have the word of the lord
[54:41] which is the revelation
[54:43] of jesus christ that comes upon that
[54:46] word
[54:47] and makes that word live and declares
[54:50] that jesus christ
[54:51] is the same yesterday today and forever
[54:54] god
[54:54] could have come think about this he
[54:57] bypassed
[54:58] all of the great schools
[55:02] brother brown stood in oral roberts
[55:04] things to open the mail
[55:06] as the mail came through and what did he
[55:09] say he said i'd be ashamed for them to
[55:11] come
[55:11] and see my office a little itty bitty
[55:14] trailer
[55:17] god never chose to come to the nerve
[55:19] centers
[55:20] you know why they would reject it
[55:23] let me tell you something this message
[55:25] has not been in a corner
[55:28] and let me just put this personal right
[55:30] now this message is not on trial right
[55:33] now
[55:34] it's already been put on trial
[55:38] god's vindicated it i'll tell you what's
[55:40] being put on trial
[55:41] is people's faith the message
[55:45] has already been vindicated
[55:48] [Music]
[55:48] [Applause]
[55:50] it's not on trial so we're not falling
[55:53] under the trap of the enemy
[55:54] to try to go back and prove it right man
[55:57] can't prove it
[55:58] it's god who proves it
[56:02] how does he prove it the same way he
[56:04] interprets his word
[56:05] god interprets his word
[56:11] so to see this of how god even how
[56:15] brother branham would put it in such a
[56:16] way god did not open up these seven
[56:19] sales
[56:20] inside of a denomination
[56:25] you know why they won't receive it see
[56:28] sometimes we
[56:29] we can kind of skim over things you
[56:31] recognize
[56:32] god's not going to reveal where there's
[56:34] no heart that's open to receive it
[56:39] well brother simon how do you how will
[56:41] the heart come open god knows if their
[56:43] heart can be opened
[56:44] and if there's a heart that can be open
[56:46] let me just tell you something
[56:47] the word will find its way there but no
[56:50] man no manner of explaining it
[56:53] is going to open one's heart that takes
[56:56] the presence of almighty god
[56:59] it may not even be a chapter that you're
[57:01] reciting
[57:02] it can be your very life and testimony
[57:04] of how your candle got lit
[57:06] and it'll open that life to a reality
[57:09] that there is a living god
[57:10] a man right here that can turn on the
[57:13] light
[57:16] my god didn't come in that manner now
[57:19] that's
[57:20] here's where we're at in this hour
[57:24] so when we look at this i want to read
[57:26] through a few scriptures here tonight
[57:30] in philippians 2 verse 5.
[57:33] don't worry i won't be much longer but i
[57:36] i got a little warm there
[57:38] verse five notice how paul
[57:42] would capture this
[57:45] the essence of god's own nature where
[57:48] because we're talking about
[57:50] charity vaunteth not itself
[57:53] it doesn't puff itself up
[57:57] charity doesn't do that now you and i
[57:59] have done that sometimes
[58:04] yep you and i have done that sometimes
[58:07] let this mind
[58:09] be in you he's talking about this
[58:11] character this nature
[58:12] let this mind be in you which was also
[58:14] in christ
[58:16] jesus who being in the form of god
[58:19] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[58:22] god
[58:24] and word robbery's a key if you've got
[58:26] it in your margin you see
[58:27] it says it's not a thing to be grasped
[58:30] for
[58:31] in other words jesus wasn't trying to
[58:33] reach out for something
[58:36] he was what god made him
[58:39] he was relying and resting on what god
[58:43] had made him
[58:44] he wasn't trying to grasp and
[58:48] notice verse 7 here well these
[58:50] scriptures are just powerful
[58:52] but made himself of no reputation
[58:56] and took upon him the form of a servant
[59:00] and was made in the likeness of man
[59:05] this is quite incredible because as he
[59:08] would make himself
[59:09] of no reputation think of it
[59:12] brother brown would say it like this he
[59:14] said here
[59:16] was the king of glory who made
[59:19] the eye and yet the man who made the
[59:21] artificial
[59:22] eye has a reputation for making it
[59:26] but here's the god who made the eye
[59:30] here's the god who made the lake but he
[59:33] never
[59:34] made himself a reputation
[59:38] [Music]
[59:39] and took upon him the form of a servant
[59:41] and was made in the likeness of men
[59:44] and being found in fashion as a man
[59:47] he humbled himself and became obedient
[59:50] unto death
[59:50] even the death of the cross wherefore
[59:53] god
[59:54] also hath highly exalted him
[59:57] so who exalted him god
[1:00:02] but he didn't exalt him
[1:00:05] until he humbled himself
[1:00:10] see god never humbled the son
[1:00:13] he humbled himself
[1:00:18] and because what was the greatest
[1:00:20] humility now he could have went along
[1:00:22] and
[1:00:22] helped elderly women cross the street
[1:00:24] and you know and baked suppers and
[1:00:26] dinners and carried them in boxes and
[1:00:28] all that right there
[1:00:29] but to realize that the humility even
[1:00:32] though that he could look upon those
[1:00:33] who were in need remember when the
[1:00:35] multitudes were following them
[1:00:36] and he would say they need something to
[1:00:38] eat all of that
[1:00:40] was something where he would take such
[1:00:41] care and the compassion of god
[1:00:43] but yet even within all of that of all
[1:00:46] that he could have done
[1:00:47] for that of humanity but yet the
[1:00:49] greatest humility
[1:00:51] in order to restore what had been lost
[1:00:53] in the fall
[1:00:54] it would require that of one who would
[1:00:57] come with
[1:00:57] such complete humility to full
[1:01:01] obedience to the word
[1:01:04] in order to bring you and i back home
[1:01:07] in order for a way to be made for us
[1:01:11] that at the very name of jesus every
[1:01:13] knee
[1:01:14] should bow of things in heaven and
[1:01:16] things in earth things under the earth
[1:01:18] and that every tongue should confess
[1:01:21] that jesus christ
[1:01:22] is lord to the glory of god the father
[1:01:26] once you think of that he made himself
[1:01:28] of no reputation
[1:01:32] i mean these are the thoughts when you
[1:01:34] think of it
[1:01:35] this is the very unfolding of this life
[1:01:38] and this character
[1:01:40] it's in such contrast to that of the
[1:01:43] world
[1:01:44] and you know us as a bible reader when
[1:01:47] we speak of the world we're not speaking
[1:01:49] of the earth
[1:01:50] the world is the system world of the
[1:01:53] world itself
[1:01:54] it entered there as satan himself he
[1:01:57] entered into that place
[1:01:58] there of the serpent and began to speak
[1:02:01] to eve
[1:02:02] and he drew eve into a place he's he's
[1:02:04] talking to her and he's he's
[1:02:06] moving upon her for her to let down
[1:02:09] but also not just to let down but now to
[1:02:12] try to present
[1:02:13] something to her this is something you
[1:02:16] don't have
[1:02:17] this is something god's keeping back
[1:02:19] from you and she begins to
[1:02:21] well have a desire for that and it's the
[1:02:24] whole part he's pulling upon
[1:02:26] to think of it what a paradox he's
[1:02:28] pulling in a place
[1:02:30] with an anointing of pride upon her life
[1:02:34] that she and herself would come into a
[1:02:36] place
[1:02:37] that though god intended and god had
[1:02:41] laid
[1:02:41] laid out in his word of that that they
[1:02:43] would multiply and replenish
[1:02:45] but as far as the mystery within it and
[1:02:48] the whole plan of god
[1:02:49] it had not been revealed as of yet to
[1:02:52] them
[1:02:53] but god god had given his word and the
[1:02:56] greatest thing that we can learn
[1:02:58] in this time is to wait on god i hope
[1:03:01] you understand what i'm saying
[1:03:02] there's things that god can speak to you
[1:03:04] like he did to abraham
[1:03:06] and said i'm going to bl i blessed you
[1:03:08] and i made you a father of many nations
[1:03:10] and the question would come how's it
[1:03:12] going to be how's it going to happen
[1:03:14] there's a lot of times you and i are
[1:03:16] faced with faith how's this going to
[1:03:18] happen
[1:03:19] when's it going to be what's it going to
[1:03:20] be like you don't have the answers for
[1:03:22] it
[1:03:23] neither do we have to feel ashamed that
[1:03:25] we don't
[1:03:26] have the explanation all we have to know
[1:03:29] is god said it and he's going to find me
[1:03:31] waiting right here
[1:03:33] for him to come and fulfill it the one
[1:03:36] that spoke it will ensure
[1:03:38] that i'm right where i need to be when
[1:03:41] that comes to pass
[1:03:43] he made himself of no
[1:03:47] reputation he could have
[1:03:51] i said he could have i want you to think
[1:03:53] of it when he came
[1:03:56] he did not come under a whole angel
[1:03:59] salute
[1:04:01] matter of fact there was that which you
[1:04:04] know
[1:04:05] it started over there to the wise men
[1:04:08] who were in the east
[1:04:09] they traveled west but they didn't get
[1:04:12] there
[1:04:13] until he was already a boy the bible
[1:04:16] never said they came to see the infant
[1:04:17] said they came to see the child
[1:04:20] is that right and the gifts what was
[1:04:22] revealed to them by the star
[1:04:24] they came with the gifts that would
[1:04:26] identify who he was on earth
[1:04:29] is that right and to think here with the
[1:04:32] great
[1:04:33] pomp and all of this that was there
[1:04:36] religious men
[1:04:37] caiaphas and all the rest of them in
[1:04:39] jerusalem
[1:04:40] mighty people but yet here the angels
[1:04:44] they come to shepherds that are out
[1:04:46] there on the hillside
[1:04:48] they come to shepherds and they make
[1:04:50] them make it known
[1:04:51] in that hour behold unto you this day
[1:04:55] is born in the city of david a king
[1:05:00] and here the shepherds themselves they
[1:05:02] come under that announcement
[1:05:04] the angels are singing and the shepherds
[1:05:06] come there there's a welcoming
[1:05:08] that's taking place the wise men the
[1:05:11] religious of that day
[1:05:13] were not there as a part of his birth
[1:05:16] as a matter of fact it bypassed them
[1:05:22] you see this is some things that we as
[1:05:25] god just chose us
[1:05:27] that we never want to become high
[1:05:31] in our thinking such as that we know
[1:05:36] something
[1:05:37] the bible said when a man thinketh he
[1:05:39] knows something he knoweth not what he
[1:05:40] ought to know
[1:05:44] you see it's discerning how the enemy
[1:05:46] would want to come
[1:05:47] in upon our lives and how god god will
[1:05:49] buy god will just bypass beyond that
[1:05:52] you realize you could sit in a service
[1:05:54] like this and say
[1:05:55] i've heard that you could finish this
[1:05:58] out you could finish that out and you
[1:05:59] might be able to finish out every
[1:06:00] scripture
[1:06:01] you might be able to finish out every
[1:06:03] quote and you would miss
[1:06:05] god god can come in such a
[1:06:09] simple way he can say what he has to say
[1:06:12] maybe in 10 minutes and you'd think i
[1:06:14] wasn't even settled in yet
[1:06:16] god can say what he needs to say he
[1:06:18] don't need a certain amount of time
[1:06:22] there's a purpose even when he called
[1:06:25] this service tonight
[1:06:26] knowing we would be here there is there
[1:06:28] is that which god
[1:06:29] wants to speak to our hearts and
[1:06:31] minister to our lives
[1:06:34] he made himself of no reputation think
[1:06:37] of it he took upon him
[1:06:38] the garment of humanity
[1:06:42] i want you to think in the scriptures
[1:06:44] there look in the scriptures
[1:06:46] and just pull it up tell no man you'll
[1:06:50] find tell no man
[1:06:51] jesus recessed that eight different
[1:06:54] times in the scripture
[1:06:56] when those that were healed here they
[1:06:59] passed through
[1:07:00] and they received their sight and they
[1:07:03] received
[1:07:04] the cleansing of leprosy and what was
[1:07:06] his
[1:07:07] what was the announcement he charged him
[1:07:09] the bible says
[1:07:11] tell no man
[1:07:14] every time tell no man he could have
[1:07:17] made
[1:07:18] himself a reputation but you see this
[1:07:21] is what's contrary to that of the world
[1:07:24] this world this system
[1:07:26] is based on this is a scriptural term
[1:07:29] pomp
[1:07:30] this is satan's pomp his pride
[1:07:34] every all that is here i will make uh
[1:07:37] you know i will ascend into the sides of
[1:07:39] the north
[1:07:40] i will be worshipped even as god he is
[1:07:42] putting himself
[1:07:43] it's a puffing up it's vaunting up it's
[1:07:46] trying to put
[1:07:47] into a place to draw attention
[1:07:50] to himself this is so contrary
[1:07:54] when god comes he comes in such humility
[1:07:58] that the very god of glory who was the
[1:08:01] very one
[1:08:02] who spoke in the beginning and the earth
[1:08:05] that he walked on
[1:08:06] he created
[1:08:10] hallelujah to think about how
[1:08:14] that even what he would experience in
[1:08:16] his own life
[1:08:17] he would experience what it was to
[1:08:19] suffer
[1:08:21] he would experience what it was to have
[1:08:24] a headache
[1:08:26] he would experience what he was to feel
[1:08:29] temptation god would condescend in such
[1:08:32] a way
[1:08:33] he would make himself of no reputation
[1:08:36] on the contrary nobody wanted anything
[1:08:39] to do with him
[1:08:42] i'm just going to preach i'll leave my
[1:08:43] notes here
[1:08:46] the bible says there was no beauty that
[1:08:48] we should desire him
[1:08:51] he was not a man that would be
[1:08:53] attractive
[1:08:55] matter of fact let me tell you what
[1:08:56] brother branham called him in the
[1:08:58] message mighty conquer
[1:08:59] he said he was a skinny spindly
[1:09:02] king skinny he was
[1:09:06] not a great big man that was you know
[1:09:09] everything you know the brother said
[1:09:11] we're all muscles and things like that
[1:09:13] he said real man isn't measured by
[1:09:15] muscles some of us can say thank god for
[1:09:17] that
[1:09:18] it's not measured by that but he says
[1:09:20] it's measured by the character
[1:09:24] see how see how contrary it is to the
[1:09:27] system
[1:09:27] of the world the system of the world is
[1:09:30] i get bigger
[1:09:31] i get tougher and muscles and they would
[1:09:33] look at look how the pharisees
[1:09:35] and even the religious zealots in that
[1:09:38] day
[1:09:38] they hated rome and they knew you should
[1:09:41] not be hating anyone
[1:09:43] but they hated them they hated them
[1:09:47] but here the lord jesus would come and
[1:09:48] say love your enemies
[1:09:51] they wanted him they looked at him in a
[1:09:53] manner
[1:09:54] come and let's overthrow rome let's
[1:09:56] overthrow this
[1:09:57] but even as he stood in pilate's hall
[1:10:00] and
[1:10:00] pilate would say he says are you king of
[1:10:04] the jews
[1:10:05] thou sayest and everything that they
[1:10:09] could say
[1:10:09] against him standing right there even in
[1:10:12] pilat's hall he would say
[1:10:14] that if my kingdom was of this world
[1:10:18] then would my servants fight for it
[1:10:22] help me preach let's not fight for this
[1:10:25] kingdom
[1:10:26] it's going down brother let's fight for
[1:10:29] that kingdom
[1:10:30] that we have received and been born of
[1:10:33] let's give everything we got
[1:10:39] now is my kingdom not of this world
[1:10:49] in temptation
[1:10:56] satan takes him up into a high mountain
[1:11:01] you know paul would write
[1:11:06] even high things won't separate us
[1:11:09] from the love of god is that right
[1:11:12] what's paul dealing with
[1:11:13] perception
[1:11:16] he takes him up and here is a natural
[1:11:20] desire
[1:11:21] after 40 days he's hungry
[1:11:24] and here's what satan does if
[1:11:29] thou be the son of god turn these stones
[1:11:32] into bread
[1:11:34] you say what's that pulling on satan
[1:11:37] is trying to get him to clown
[1:11:43] he's trying to see can i
[1:11:46] i am the son of god i am the son of god
[1:11:49] he's trying to
[1:11:50] see if what he's saying can get him
[1:11:53] puffed up
[1:11:57] now truly all three of these temptations
[1:12:00] all that's in the world lust of the eyes
[1:12:03] lust of the flesh
[1:12:04] and the pride of life and here he is
[1:12:09] that test is passed
[1:12:13] as he stands upon the word
[1:12:16] that shall worship the lord thy god
[1:12:20] he stands there on the word and here
[1:12:23] satan takes him to another place
[1:12:25] satan didn't give up he took him to
[1:12:27] another place took him to the pinnacle
[1:12:31] right there in the city cast thyself
[1:12:34] down
[1:12:35] if thou be the son of god on and on we
[1:12:38] could go
[1:12:40] and jesus he stood there thou shalt
[1:12:43] worship the lord
[1:12:45] the lord thy god only you know you know
[1:12:48] what as it says
[1:12:49] you see satan is trying to pull him in a
[1:12:52] place to where
[1:12:53] he feels like he has to prove something
[1:12:55] let me just tell you something
[1:12:57] you don't have to prove nothing to the
[1:12:59] devil
[1:13:02] are you with me stop trying to convince
[1:13:05] him you're a christian
[1:13:08] stop trying to convince him well you
[1:13:10] know i don't know about this stop trying
[1:13:12] to convince him
[1:13:13] you're the one who had the experience
[1:13:15] you're the one who knows don't have to
[1:13:18] prove nothing to him
[1:13:21] are you with me if thou be the son of
[1:13:24] god
[1:13:24] it stood in the midst of temptation he
[1:13:27] offered him
[1:13:28] a great position many can pass on
[1:13:32] through those parts brother braham takes
[1:13:34] that in the message of harvest time
[1:13:35] here the last part a position is
[1:13:38] promised
[1:13:39] a position among men i will give thee
[1:13:42] the kingdoms of the world
[1:13:43] i will give you a bishop place i will
[1:13:45] give you as a presiding elder
[1:13:46] i will give you a part in the church i
[1:13:48] will give you a part it's
[1:13:50] promised apart
[1:13:55] but the word stood the test each time
[1:14:01] that temptation didn't end
[1:14:04] he goes down in john chapter seven i've
[1:14:08] got it there but i just want to just i
[1:14:10] just want to go
[1:14:12] he comes among his brethren
[1:14:15] and his brethren come to him now the
[1:14:17] bible says they didn't believe him
[1:14:21] but here's what they said to him no man
[1:14:25] that does miracles like this and has
[1:14:27] signs
[1:14:28] keep it to himself and doesn't show it
[1:14:31] to everybody
[1:14:34] but jesus knew they didn't believe him
[1:14:38] see it's discerning and what he was
[1:14:41] trying to do here was his brethren
[1:14:44] when he met him on the mountain that was
[1:14:46] not somebody else
[1:14:48] satan was there but now right down here
[1:14:51] the discernment comes on what satan's
[1:14:54] trying to do
[1:14:55] is drawn out to puff it up sure show
[1:14:58] yourself
[1:14:59] make yourself known what's he trying to
[1:15:01] do get him to move into a place of
[1:15:03] reputation
[1:15:07] oh glory be god but how the king of
[1:15:10] glory
[1:15:12] he came down and not just
[1:15:15] listen of the scripture what we just
[1:15:17] read not only
[1:15:19] did he take upon the likeness
[1:15:22] of sinful flesh but the scripture goes
[1:15:25] on to say
[1:15:26] he took on him the form of a servant
[1:15:30] and in that he was found as a man
[1:15:34] see here he come in humanity we look and
[1:15:37] say
[1:15:37] my your god has taken upon
[1:15:40] the garments of humanity but that alone
[1:15:43] wasn't enough
[1:15:45] he humbled himself
[1:15:54] i tell you one thing you can say this is
[1:15:56] true
[1:15:57] the lord jesus lived what he preached
[1:16:02] when they started arguing about who's
[1:16:04] supposed to be the greatest among them
[1:16:08] he let him know this is the kind of
[1:16:10] things that the gentiles the world
[1:16:12] seeks after you know how the world
[1:16:15] gets great steps on this one to step on
[1:16:18] that one to step on this one to step on
[1:16:20] that that's how the world
[1:16:22] the world the world you see it's it's
[1:16:25] after
[1:16:26] position where does that motivation come
[1:16:28] from
[1:16:29] hmm i will ascend
[1:16:34] you see it's a desire for power
[1:16:38] but power without character
[1:16:41] is satanic the bible said to make the
[1:16:46] captain
[1:16:46] of their salvation perfect it was
[1:16:49] sufferings
[1:16:51] you wonder why the tests and the trials
[1:16:52] that you have to go through sometimes
[1:16:55] you wonder why sometimes like the lord
[1:16:57] jesus
[1:16:59] or maybe you've got something that's
[1:17:01] been said about you
[1:17:04] his name was a black name but he didn't
[1:17:06] spend his life
[1:17:08] trying to explain that
[1:17:12] see this is discernment he didn't
[1:17:14] explain he didn't try to do that
[1:17:16] you think it didn't hurt him let me say
[1:17:18] hurt him you think he didn't feel it
[1:17:21] come on the bible says he was tempted in
[1:17:22] all points such as we are
[1:17:25] sure brother branham lets us know he
[1:17:27] listen he had to turn his head brother
[1:17:28] the same as you have to turn your head
[1:17:31] the bible said suffered in hebrews
[1:17:33] chapter 2 that means
[1:17:35] to undergo a sensible experience
[1:17:39] brother brown would put it just as plain
[1:17:41] as this how can overcome
[1:17:42] he said jesus was tempted to take
[1:17:45] the kingdoms without suffering
[1:17:50] tempted means pulled his flesh
[1:17:53] was pulled
[1:18:01] sometimes we wonder why we have to go
[1:18:04] through the things we go through
[1:18:05] sometimes
[1:18:06] there's not one of us in here not one of
[1:18:10] us
[1:18:11] the like to feel dumb
[1:18:16] and sometimes you wonder after you come
[1:18:18] out of a situation
[1:18:19] you seem like you got a lot of words to
[1:18:21] say then well if i could have just said
[1:18:23] this then
[1:18:24] if i'd just said this if this would have
[1:18:26] come then if this would have come then
[1:18:30] is that right sometimes what it is
[1:18:33] and you say well i'm going to make sure
[1:18:34] that it don't happen again listen
[1:18:36] friends
[1:18:37] there's a part of that that maybe you
[1:18:38] don't recognize that's god
[1:18:41] there's many times you look in the
[1:18:43] scriptures jesus
[1:18:45] turned aside much more than he stood and
[1:18:47] answered
[1:18:49] they tried to press on him
[1:18:52] the bible said they pressed upon him
[1:18:55] with questions
[1:18:57] vehemently to try to getting to say
[1:19:00] something
[1:19:01] like moses struck the rock out of anger
[1:19:04] they tried to get on him
[1:19:07] he was tempted god so condescended in
[1:19:11] such a measure
[1:19:12] to be tempted he was tempted with pride
[1:19:15] charity vaunteth not itself he was
[1:19:18] tempted with pride
[1:19:23] he had no bed to lay his head
[1:19:26] someone said can i follow you he said
[1:19:28] come but the son of man
[1:19:30] doesn't even have a place to lay his
[1:19:31] head i don't have no fine place to take
[1:19:33] you to
[1:19:36] see it wasn't about a drawing
[1:19:40] he was drawing to god the bible says god
[1:19:42] was
[1:19:43] in christ reconciling the world
[1:19:46] unto himself
[1:19:50] in humility and here he is
[1:19:54] a great warrior and in the closing
[1:19:58] moments
[1:20:00] the bible says it in this manner in john
[1:20:02] 13. when he knew
[1:20:06] he knew his time has come he knew
[1:20:09] what the father had given him to do
[1:20:12] after supper is over
[1:20:15] he's already told them remember before
[1:20:17] when they were arguing
[1:20:18] he already told them i am one among you
[1:20:22] as one who serveth
[1:20:25] you see somebody that's always wanting
[1:20:27] to be served
[1:20:28] that ain't of god
[1:20:33] but i need to be this or i need to do
[1:20:35] this so people thought it this way
[1:20:39] what you need is a needle to pop that
[1:20:41] air
[1:20:42] i'm glad god can can bring that needle
[1:20:44] and pop our air aren't you
[1:20:48] down at the altar and say forgive me
[1:20:50] lord
[1:20:52] [Applause]
[1:20:54] he said i'm one among you that service
[1:20:58] here he steps forward his final moments
[1:21:01] his final moments
[1:21:02] final moments
[1:21:05] you're finished with supper he steps
[1:21:08] aside
[1:21:12] and he girds himself
[1:21:16] with an apron
[1:21:19] he takes water he gets the water he
[1:21:21] don't say hey
[1:21:22] hey brother gabriel you'll get me the
[1:21:24] water he doesn't say that
[1:21:26] he goes and gets it
[1:21:30] because anyhow he'd have to be the one
[1:21:31] to bring the water to our lives
[1:21:34] we sure couldn't get it he had to bring
[1:21:36] it to us
[1:21:37] is that right so here he comes he takes
[1:21:41] the water
[1:21:42] and he kneels down in front of them
[1:21:46] and he begins to wash their feet and
[1:21:48] peter
[1:21:49] no lord you're not going to wash
[1:21:53] my feet no lord
[1:21:56] no peter
[1:22:00] if i don't do this you have no part with
[1:22:03] me
[1:22:04] see jesus was speaking much deeper than
[1:22:05] just foot washing
[1:22:07] he was talking about soul washing
[1:22:10] are you with me
[1:22:14] here he is the lowest of low
[1:22:18] think how brother branham would say this
[1:22:20] over and over
[1:22:21] you're familiar with the message said
[1:22:24] what made him so great to me
[1:22:26] is he was able and he made himself
[1:22:30] so little
[1:22:35] miracles after miracles
[1:22:38] signs after signs wonders after wonders
[1:22:43] but he made himself of no reputation
[1:22:47] being in the form of god thought it not
[1:22:50] robbery he wasn't out there trying to
[1:22:52] prove who he was
[1:22:55] he didn't clown for the enemy trying to
[1:22:58] prove
[1:23:00] he took the form of a servant
[1:23:04] he humbled himself to the word and as
[1:23:08] god revealed to him
[1:23:10] what to do
[1:23:13] god never revealed to him hey
[1:23:17] go defend your name let's even get that
[1:23:20] black mark off of your name
[1:23:22] what they're saying about you god never
[1:23:24] told him hey
[1:23:25] this criticism you need to get this
[1:23:29] criticism away from you
[1:23:30] they're criticizing you
[1:23:35] they called him beelzebub
[1:23:40] what are you saying brother samuel jesus
[1:23:43] didn't
[1:23:44] occupy himself trying to change
[1:23:48] people's minds about him
[1:23:55] he didn't try to put on some sort of a
[1:23:57] perception
[1:23:58] neither as we said he didn't make
[1:24:01] himself
[1:24:02] a reputation but here's the king of
[1:24:05] glory
[1:24:07] standing in all humility
[1:24:10] one who stopped the wind
[1:24:14] the waves obeyed him
[1:24:17] the god of glory but yet he did not
[1:24:21] want himself at all
[1:24:25] tempted in all points let me close with
[1:24:27] this
[1:24:28] tempted in all points such as we are
[1:24:31] yet without sin there's no one of you or
[1:24:35] i
[1:24:35] can see that but he had to be that for
[1:24:39] us
[1:24:40] that we might receive that perfect life
[1:24:42] inside of us
[1:24:44] that that perfection of life inside of
[1:24:46] you or me that when we are tempted
[1:24:50] when we have got a little puffed up
[1:24:54] the spirit of god brings a correction
[1:24:56] and says
[1:24:59] you're approaching that wrong you're
[1:25:02] calling you're going about this the
[1:25:03] wrong way
[1:25:05] and correction comes into our life
[1:25:11] because he was willing to become so low
[1:25:15] think how brother braham said it he said
[1:25:18] here come
[1:25:19] the king of glory down to the lowest
[1:25:22] city
[1:25:23] jericho and he got so low that the
[1:25:26] shortest man in the city had to climb up
[1:25:28] in the tree to look down on him
[1:25:32] this is why just close
[1:25:36] brother branham would admonish us by the
[1:25:38] scripture much more but
[1:25:39] just to lay this foundation tonight the
[1:25:42] more simple you can become
[1:25:44] the more humble the more god can use you
[1:25:49] this is the things that even with what
[1:25:51] god has opened
[1:25:52] and what he's revealed to us we realize
[1:25:55] it's the mercy of god listen friends
[1:25:57] even if your heart
[1:25:59] has been turned and opened as we were
[1:26:01] saying on sunday that's the mercy of god
[1:26:03] it's the mercy of god as young people to
[1:26:05] be able to hear
[1:26:06] the word of god in this hour it's god's
[1:26:10] mercy
[1:26:10] for god to speak to our lives think of
[1:26:13] it it's not in a big
[1:26:14] some big society or somewhere but it's
[1:26:17] right here right among us
[1:26:19] god just simply just passing right here
[1:26:21] among us
[1:26:22] god's simply working and you know what
[1:26:24] it's not even by the culture it's not
[1:26:26] even by the cultural thinking of mind
[1:26:28] see that's why that where our approach
[1:26:31] listen friends
[1:26:32] our approach to this message is not of a
[1:26:35] of a mind or a thinking it's
[1:26:38] god it's god revealing himself
[1:26:42] we don't want to become educated
[1:26:46] we're to be born of the spirit of god
[1:26:48] and be sensitive to his
[1:26:50] leading to be mindful when he's speaking
[1:26:53] to be yielded to him and say oh god
[1:26:57] speak to me lord lord come by my way
[1:27:00] lord
[1:27:01] and to realize the world
[1:27:05] and the way that this though we've been
[1:27:08] born of the spirit of god
[1:27:11] this guy has got to be brought subject
[1:27:14] to the word
[1:27:18] i said moments ago and i told you it's
[1:27:19] closing too
[1:27:22] this guy doesn't like to be made to look
[1:27:24] dumb
[1:27:25] or be made to look like he doesn't know
[1:27:28] an answer
[1:27:30] is that right but sometimes that's god's
[1:27:34] program
[1:27:35] and god's way to see are you able to
[1:27:39] humble yourself
[1:27:40] even in the midst of a situation
[1:27:44] are you able to look at it you could
[1:27:46] take you could take
[1:27:47] you could take a position we've all been
[1:27:50] there
[1:27:51] you could take a position on something
[1:27:53] and really you're waiting for that
[1:27:54] breath as soon as they take that breath
[1:27:56] even if it's not a comma you're going to
[1:27:57] put a common their sentence form and
[1:27:59] jump in you know it's like waiting on
[1:28:01] the mirror go around
[1:28:04] and you're waiting for him because
[1:28:05] you're going to lay it in
[1:28:08] what is that well if you've been born of
[1:28:11] the spirit of god it certainly isn't
[1:28:12] charity
[1:28:15] but it's that flesh part
[1:28:18] this is why depending on our makeup
[1:28:20] depending on background this is why
[1:28:22] we not only need to live in the spirit
[1:28:25] we need to walk in the spirit
[1:28:29] let's pray heavenly father
[1:28:32] lord jesus as we just bow our heads and
[1:28:34] our hearts lord in your presence
[1:28:38] lord we realize that lord as we
[1:28:42] would look into this tonight we're it's
[1:28:44] not something lord that would be new
[1:28:47] that's not what we would want to do
[1:28:48] anyhow lord but father to look
[1:28:52] as you would speak to us lord upon the
[1:28:55] character
[1:28:56] and that character of life that we've
[1:28:58] received

[1:29:04] things

[1:29:13] with lord
[1:29:15] and it's not always something maybe
[1:29:16] that's that's known
[1:29:20] maybe that we recognize right away but
[1:29:22] lord
[1:29:24] we need you our confidence lord

[1:29:40] believe that

[1:29:49] prayer with you lord

[1:30:02] of that first birth lord

[1:30:07] been delivered of that pride
[1:30:11] father maybe lord as
[1:30:14] your prophet would tell us when a life
[1:30:17] accepts you
[1:30:18] heart would say lord i want to receive
[1:30:21] you as my savior
[1:30:23] he said that is likened a person
[1:30:26] stepping inside the door
[1:30:28] on the welcome mat of the house
[1:30:32] the lord god we don't want to leave you
[1:30:34] on that welcome mat
[1:30:36] if you've been invited the prophet would
[1:30:39] say it like this

[1:30:44] called pride
[1:30:47] lord jesus may there not be one here
[1:30:50] tonight lord
[1:30:52] that would keep that door of pride but
[1:30:56] they would surrender it to you lord
[1:30:59] that dear god that you could move
[1:31:01] through that door and
[1:31:02] every other door in their life
