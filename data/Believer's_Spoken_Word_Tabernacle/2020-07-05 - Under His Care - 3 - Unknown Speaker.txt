our hearts desire is to worship you in spirit and in truth Lord we pray this morning as this congregation we've gathered our hearts together may there not be one Lord that here among us or by

thank you Lord once again yes you just bless the word now Lord o God may the holy spirit just have three minutes I pray in Jesus precious name Amen god bless you amen and want to say we welcome sister Lily's parents god bless you [Applause] brother Matt when we spoke on the phone over a year ago who knew we'd be here like this evidently it was a good report and the report was received but we just certainly certainly appreciate you all amen and good to see each and every one of you and it's good to be in the house of the Lord this night amen let's turn in the word of the Lord if we tonight or this morning to psalms chapter one Psalms chapter 1 verse 1 blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful but his delight goes here is this man who is blessed is now moving in his life but his delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water we know those rivers is old and new Testament that bringeth forth his fruit in his sings in his season God's fruit in the season that he sends his messenger with that word his fruit in his season his leaf also shall not wither anybody ever like looking at withering leaves I mean nobody looks at a plant of withering leaves and says Oh in that beautiful but usually withering lead you say that it needs water but his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper verse 4 the ungodly are not so but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away so after a period of time they dry up now when we look at these conditions here there's not this particular condition in verses 1 through 3 of this godly man as though that he's exempt from troubles he's exempt from pressures no same conditions around it same things that can come their way but the difference is one has a life source a hidden life source verse 5 therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous for the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous the way of the ungodly Shall Perish amen I'd like to speak to you once again on the fought under his care may God bless you bless the word as you're being seated I want to go to another portion of scripture that the Holy Spirit would direct Jeremiah to in the time where judgment is impending while judgment is impending you find not only has God spoke through Jeremiah and through Isaiah but you find the love of God even speaking through Jeremiah that they would correct and amend their ways God would even speak to them that to how their lives were to be conducted so that there might be seed that would return into the land we realized that in our lives we from the very fall when the fall took place that death entered in we realized sin entered in and all of that the curse and the judgments are there but God in His mercy he made provision and he told the woman I will give thee a seed and that seed would be that of his own life that of his own creation God would place that that seed that life he would bring forth that body and God would come in that body to redeem his children and though we walk in this world we experience sickness we experience many conditions of the fall but once our soul has been redeemed we're no longer lost we've been found and God has given us a promise yes the world will pass away however I'm gonna bring you back here so when we look at it we find in Jeremiah 17:5 thus saith the Lord cursed be the man that trusteth in man and maketh his flesh his arm and whose heart departed from the Lord for he shall be like the heath in the desert and shall not see when good cometh but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness in a salt land and not inhabited but blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord and whose hope the Lord is for he shall be as a tree planted by the waters and that spreadeth out her roots by the river and shall not see when he cometh but her leaf shall be green he will come but it will not be her focus the the conditions come but will not be her focus and shall not be careful in the year of drought neither shall cease from yielding fruit now in a very simple measure I look at this within the scripture and many times you know when if you were to plant flowers trees or other things around your house home yard many times you find that where sometimes we all could we'll take the holes and we're watering like this and we see the leaves we see the water dripping off the leaves you think oh my I've watered this one real good and we move over to this we've watered this one and come back water this one we go all around and and after you know 15 minutes 20 minutes 30 minutes they have watered everything we water these but yet the watering that we see on the top where the water is dripping does not mean that that plants been really watered some of you understand you know where things I think back to the greenhouse days and other times you know even round in our own home they'll sell hoses that the water goes through and then it'll just beat out and are just a little drop will drop out of there not a lot of not a lot of sound going on it's just dropping they have the hoses where you put in your bed and the little drip lines will come right out of there almost like replicating the greenhouse and it'll drop right into a plant it's just dropping trunk you might wonder and say well why it doesn't seem like that plant is getting us really water as much as if I have the the hose on it full throttle but you see here's the here's the part of it when it's dripping it's that water it's allowing that plant to drink and take in that water and what happens is as that plant it soaks in that water the water will actually go down beneath where the plant is at and the roots will follow that water down beneath when water is just sprayed around like this roots grow shallow and when they grow shallow eventually this is when things die now this isn't a hora culture or less than anything but I think how fitting remember God wrote his Bible in the heavens and even as it speaks here within the scriptures it shows that it's got to be more than just a watering out here it's gotta be a penetration down to the soul it's got to be a water that Justin might just come drip drip drip but if it's soaking it up this is why I think of the simple words that brother Bram would use he says if that little plant everything that's in it he says was in it when it was there as a seed if it will just drink drink not just be where the water's act and enjoying the water but drink take in of the water and so when the water goes down what they call a deep watering then the roots will follow it down so when we get into conditions like this out here after that they say about two to three years then it really gets to be an established plant and you don't have to go out there every morning at 5:00 in the morning and watering around and you know and the drip line why it's roots have went so deep it finds sources of water that in the midst of the drought its leaf is still green I believe that's the work of the Holy Spirit of what God's desire is is that our lives would be so connected with Jesus Christ God just doesn't want us to feel good he wants to take and that our soul would be so anchored in the Lord Jesus to where a whole life from that point he'd goes so deep to where a whole day life becomes wrapped up in him lack the roots it just keeps going deeper deeper deeper deeper deeper in him this is why when the scripture Paul would write in Ephesians three this was he prayed for this that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breadth the length depth and high and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge beyond this the love of Christ passes knowledge it can't be reasoned it passes beyond it's greater than any of our thoughts that you might be filled with all the fullness of God and this is why when brother Branham would speak concerning this and he would say in contrasting and saying many there for the fat errand age out of the Book of Revelations he said many he said the commentators have went all around about the depths of Satan he said they bypassed and he said because they don't understand it I think brother Bram says like this he says it's actually quite simple he said if we can just take he said the depths of God then we can contrast that and know what the depths of Satan is the depths of God is that there is a personal experience where we have passed from death unto life and brother Bram would say it's just like this it's an actual an experience where the depth of God comes in that man's life it's an actual personal experience of the Spirit of God indwelling him and his mind is illuminated by the wisdom and knowledge of God through the word it becomes a life that is illuminated what is the experience where you pass from death unto life this is why brother Ram would say away with experience and back to the word he wasn't talking about do away with experience he's saying that let everything the word is to testify of that experience in your life you see the deep watering of the word jesus said the kingdom of God cometh without observation sometimes we can look and say it doesn't seem like well this one's moving or this one's moving at what should we do keep the dripline going keep the dripline going and it keeps dripping and eventually that bowl bets around that tree that's there in that sack it's just saturating it's taking in and that water starts going down slowly it's not just running off I don't want this word to run off of me I wanna of this world brother I wanted to be my life to be so saturated with this word not about what I understand even when I'm listening to the message not that I remember everything he said I just want to be a saturated life [Applause] let it be saturated Lord in my life depth to that life where the roots are still growing tests and trials come winds come but the winds remember as the Prophet told us then bend that tree or that plant and you could say oh my goodness hold that tree oh it's bending he said but what's happening is the roots are being loosened up to give you a greater hold tests and trials are are not our enemy it's not against us but it's under God's sovereign oversight and direction then you can see not that God needs to see you can see there's a greater anchor in your life an acre beyond your knowledge or understanding it's a reality of Ag living God inside of you that it's not me holding on it's him holding me this is why Paul would say if you then be risen with Christ seek those things which are above where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God set your affection on things above not on things of the earth for ye are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God when Christ who is our life shall appear then shall ye also appear with him in glory think about winning the Lord Jesus comes in John 6 I've missed needs to go by Samaria the rest of disciples go off and they go to buy food there's food that's needed when they come back here they're witnessing that the latter parts of what takes place with this little woman at the well remember Jesus he speaks to them and they say you're not hungry and Jesus said I have meat to eat that you know not of and my meat is to do the will of the Father it was alive listen we talk we look at the life of the Lord Jesus and say well he was here and the promises are the quickening power comes in him as he walks about of the River Jordan but remember even though he was the word I hope you with me now he was the word but it did not mean that he didn't read the word he knew where to go and the Spirit gave unction he wasn't just up there flipping around in a scroll and saying well I wonder where it's gonna fall open today he was led by the spirit to go to Isaiah the Holy Spirit in that hour directed the word to that hour for its place in the word and he opened that and began to speak and when he when he read what Isaiah wrote under inspiration the Spirit of the Lord is upon me it was no longer words it was now the announcement of the word in fresh and the message letting off the pressure the brem says I met a woman here some years ago in a 10-cent store she was about 60 years old looked about 30 years old I said how do you do it sister she said brother Brown I've got two sons that's doctors thence that's older than you are and honest to goodness she didn't look over 30 years old she said here's what it is when I come to Christ when I was about 12 years old I sat down and thought about it i standed other religions but when I found the true and she said I come to Christ and took my case my soul my all to him and she said I've never had a worry since so now he promised to take care of all my troubles and said if he's not big enough to do it I know I'm not big enough to do it so what's the use of me worrying about it powerful powerful you're not even getting charged an arm and a leg for this session hallelujah this is body changing material this is life changing word hallelujah this is a balm in Gilead that brings healing now well you say how do I do it now don't let me go back he says Christ promised that he'd take all our worry all your worries cast your cares on him so what are you worried about worry builds up pressure pressure blows up so just cast your cares on him and quit worrying now well you say how do I do it just trust his promise he made a promise he would do it even in the time of death when the Death Angel comes into the room oh brother branham I know I'll be nervous oh no you're in the refuge no no you you you you know you're good you're going to die you got to go some way so you just get in that refuge feel safe you're safe as long as you're in the refuge remember he died for you he cares for you he died for you now let's take a look you say brother branham you mean when the Death Angel was knocking at the door you're still not gonna get steamed up no not a bit well how do you do that come to the refuge I'm glad we have a place I'm glad there's a refuge a refuge of our soul and in that refuge in Christ all the promises are yeah and amen every situation that may come your way or has come your way you know by a direct witness God has already made a promise that covers every situation sometimes the answer doesn't come in our timing or when we want it or the way that we're thinking about it but God in His grace he worked works with us in all of that whole situation to bring us to a place by experience to trust in him you see the word it's not just something that we just we just know David said now he says David said and I believe it's there in the Psalms where David said it was good for me to be afflicted now I have learned thy word because why affliction brings learning how do we learn through suffering hello you and nothing we glory in suffering but we glory in God's provision - no he's right here with me second Corinthians chapter 2 verse 11 let's Satan should get an advantage of us for we are not ignorant of his devices second Corinthians ten verses three through six for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ and having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled I'm glad were under his care aren't you he has equipped us he has equipped us with his power he has equipped us with all that we have need of once you listen this how brother branham brings us in greatest battle ever fought Satan's army brings diseases that's what Satan is he's a destroyer Satan the whole kingdom of Satan is sickness death and sorrow and frustrations and worry all on Satan God is life faith joy peace over here attributes of two kingdoms and we're caught right in the middle when we have been born again we have been translated into the kingdom of his dear son our soul but this body must be born again just as our soul was born again our soul is no longer susceptible to sin we've been changed we've been sealed the desire has left our life but yet in the other two realms we can be affected from time to time they're right sickness disease and things that can come away even as Paul would deal right here by the Spirit of God even in our mind our thoughts and even within our spirit now notice this now that's the two great forces that's coming together right now they're battling they're battling right here in the building right now they battle day by day with you every force Satan comes at you to hit you with worry he'll come at you to try to hit you with frustration you try to come hit you with sorrow he'll try to come hit you with death they're battling day by day and just even how the Prophet would place it Satan doesn't say oh no oh yeah well you know I'll be out here waiting at the end of the street when you all get done no no he comes he's right in here [Music] is that right he's right in here but you know what we're not giving him the majority we're not giving him any place we're not giving him any fault if something wants to come in and say well my situation is too great no we're not giving the devil any place you might say well well I've given him place out there huh my fault I've entertained I've looked down you know upon myself but right here is a ground that the Prophet would tell many people standing on the prayer line you've prayed for a place that you could put your foot down for your healing he said this is the place for you to put your foot down Oh glory be to God Satan following you along that great big kingly priestly life trying to scare the liver out of you pretty interesting you need your liver you know that your liver is what helps you process your proteins your carbohydrates your fats you need that to be able to process the food your fortified a man with the gospel with the word of truth around your loin glory notice what he's doing he's getting the people the believer to look at their armor glory preacher that's what it is helmet of salvation the shield of faith and the sword waving it in your hand so if you've got it all sheathed up this morning it's time to get it out when do I put it back in the sheath when you stand on the other side you don't ever put up that sword that sword you're waving it in your hand no repeater God waving in your head Satan I'm coming to meet you you meet me in the name of science you meet me in the name of culture you meet me in the name of organization you meet me in the name of this that or the other Corona but I meet you in the name of the Lord God of Israel I'm coming after you give way even death itself can't stand there chop a hole right through it whatever name he wants to come under we come in the name of the Lord [Applause] Satan's army brings diseases and God's army is commissioned to cast them out amen there you are every time Satan throws any on unto you God's army is to cast Emma so there's nothing to prevent Satan from throwing casting diseases on us but we have authority we've got promises that belong to us I will take sickness from the midst of you I'm the Lord that he loved all the diseases by His stripes I am healed we can't stop were not immune from diseases from sicknesses from those things coming but we have Authority with the word to address the situation simply put we've got the answer to the devil's question a life that'll take that word you see it's not a sword as long as it's just a word I've just thought but when that word is taken into your heart brother it now becomes as Paul wrote taking the sword of the Spirit which is the Rhema of God it is that word that is revealed in our heart it's something that's personal it's not what we know here but it's something that down here we're just resting in that and somebody can say how do you know what I just know he said so and I'm trusting in him who made the promise every time Satan throws any on you every time God's army is to catch the mount that's the very technique that God used so God just didn't ask the devil devil if you don't mind um would you mind leaving them God cast him out he's not going to treat his it the devil nicely that's the very technique that God used Satan used the army of destruction to disbelieve God's Word and set him on a better Kingdom and Michael had and God cast him out God's method is cast out the evil cast down reasonings cast down superstitions notice don't try to reason them out cast them down casting down reasoning casting down superstitions casting down worried casting down diseases casting down sin you're above it notice notice this counsel of the Lord he's directing the children of God to the authority that they have been raised to he's directing them to the authority you're above it resurrected in Christ Jesus setting in heavenly places with every devil under your foot if he starts to stick his head in there you know you're dead your life is hid what is dead you're dead to your senses you're dead to your conscience your own human will would say yes I guess I but you're dead to your reasoning dead to all those things and you are buried in the name of Jesus Christ and raised with him and wherever he is there you are also you know the reality of it is is that being dead that realization of being dead to it it also deals with what you're feeding on what you're giving yourself to depends and will determine the strength you have to be able to wield that shield that that sword in your life this is not something that you can just come to church on Thursday and expect to live just a victorious life when I come to church you know once a week and well you know I come to church and and I said no your life you'll never have a victorious life until you really first of all if you've not been born again you're first of all need to have the victory of Calvary and the resurrection in your life that will lift you above sin the other part is is that for you to live a victorious life in the Lord Jesus Christ you've got to have a life that lives in the word and walks in the word and feasts on the word that doesn't mean you're memorizing everything it doesn't mean that you know all the chapters you know the quotes you know the vernacular that's not what it is at all it means you're drinking in of the Word of God you're taking it in and letting it drip down you realize when it drips down there's nothing necessarily a sound there's not something that's like oh my goodness you feel that drip no that drip think about the dude that was on your grass this morning did anybody hear that do come down last night no seen a lot of smoke from them fireworks but they're wonder what you didn't see that do coming down but the dew came down brother you know the dew is the promise to that of the heirs it was promised to Jacob that I would give you the do the do comes in the stillness of the night it settles down and to think about it in our lives to be able to stand there and to cast down and to be dead to all of our reasonings I'm not going to ask you to raise your hands but many of us we have made sometimes we've leaned to our own human we our own human mind instead of giving the mind of Christ the right away in our lives those are always the times that we have to say forgive me because there's only two ways right way wrong way God's Way our way what happened notice he says when one of them doubters got in heaven God kicked him out and what did he say to the soldiers that's raised in Christ when a devil comes along you see it is not we're not exempt from the devil coming along but when he does can't kick him out casting out brem says I'm crucified with him nevertheless I live not me even live but he that liveth in me the word going on before God cutting away with his sharp two-edged sword and brother Brown takes this the song that the woman wrote when she saw grant coming in there in victory there in the Civil War he says no wonder when grant took Richmond and that little southern woman seen seen grant coming in the inspiration struck her and she said mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord he is tramping out the vintage where The Grapes with Wrath are stored he loosed the faithful lightning with his terrible Swift sword his troops are marching on listen this how did grant take Richmond just as he come to it you can't take it till you get to it you can't take Jericho's till you get to it but it belongs to you you can't take a on til you get to it but it belongs to you that's how God soldiers takes in sickness just as they come to it God might be dealing with your heart this morning to take sin he might be anointing your life this morning for you to lay down your life he's equipping you with his word his spirit his life to rise up and surrender your life God equips andin doused his children to rise what is it it's the drip of the holy spirit that saturation and moving down into that life to rise and take that promise notice just as they come to it that's the way they overcome their doubts and fears and things when one Rises they chopped him down the son died never faced this yet you will what will I do you'll take it when you get to it just like many of the things when you know I first started out serving the Lord I could not understand some of the battles and different things that some of the others maybe would have go through or whatever you know it's a wonderful honeymoon time and it still it's it's it's greater now serving the Lord after the things that God has brought me through had to Humble me teach me and he's still doing that he's been mighty long-suffering with me he's been very patient with me but I realized that there are things that within it it all must begin with first of all a life that is established it's rooted and grounded in him and then when we come to situations in our lives that's when we take them it's a little different for somebody to talk that's been through something you're with me then it is for somebody who's not been through anything and I'll tell you this is that you've been through that no that doesn't mean we discredit the Word of God there's a lot of things Paul did not experience but Paul was able to by the unction of the Spirit of God be able to admonish our lives marriage is on and on and on right but when we recognize within this all how much greater it is and God would place that even in the church to where there are experiences of things of how that we have come through so when we come to that this is how we overcome our doubts and fears and things why you've got greater is He that's in you there's already been an overcoming in your life when one Rises they chop him down move out of the way God cast him out like you did in heaven our great chief captain showed us how it was done now the scripture would go on and it would speak to us about casting all of our cares upon him I I don't have time to read this scripture right now but it would speak how we are to cast all of our cares upon him after humbling ourselves under the mighty hand of God because the enemies like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour this is why the Spirit of God would call out and say be sober be village and why it shows if he's calling for soberness there must be a heightened drunkenness this world is drunk right now but so are we what kind of drunk are you I'm sober drunk I've got my right mind I've been intoxicated by the Holy Ghost I got my right mind I didn't used to have my right mind I'm a sober drunk I'm sober from the things and the drunkenness of the world but I'm filled with the wine of Almighty God the wine he has provided in this age the banquet Esther's fees I am taken with this wine whom resist steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world in that a trick of the devil to make you think something odd about you you're the only one dealing with this you're the only one going through this God doesn't always come right away and give an answer this is where trust comes in but how encouraging it is we can see through the word of the Lord we can look back and say well yeah my brother and God brought them through the same God that brought them through the same God bringing me through this in this scripture here Psalms 12 25 heaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop this word heaviness means anxiety anxiousness worry maketh it stoop or the word to depress anxiety is one of those things that can come around we see the scripture the Lord Jesus would admonish us even in our lives that there are certain things do not be anxious about don't even try to entertain thoughts for tomorrow for sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof in other words there will be troubles and worries you've got things to deal with tomorrow don't don't don't try to entertain what's tomorrow say right and many times if the Prophet would deal with situations where people were dealing with nervous trouble and he'd deal dealing with heart trouble dealing with this and it would not say you know what your heart is bad and this and that but it would go right down and say your problem has always been your make up and yet I'm fearfully and wonderfully made come on now God didn't make a mistake and say oh no I put a little bit too much chloric in you I put a little bit too much melancholy I shouldn't have done that I'm fearfully and wonderfully made so they until now when we look at this lord help me to yield my life to the authority that you have placed within me this is our greatest challenge this is our greatest victory this is the greatest enemy that we face heaviness anxiety you know many times when they when they talk about I've studied it studied some things on it and when you look at with anxiety the way that things that would experience and no doubt every one of us to a certain degree some no doubt deal with it more than others but the one way that they'll describe that of anxiety is where you've got thoughts in your mind and all of a sudden it'll be one little thought or a situation that will take place and it will actually hijack the very neurons and the pathways that are within the brain and you would look at that and say oh brother samuel we don't even need God wrote about that in his word God wrote about it but the thoughts that were supposed to think God knew those situations and conditions would be very you know you just want you look at it sometimes in the prophets ministry where different ones were right there with him and they were never of their stomach condition had to take Rolaids and comes the rest of their life it wasn't that God's power was weak not at all but God proves in the midst of this situation that His grace is greater offense and think about this if those things would work in that level how is it that the enemy would want to try to come and bring situations and alive that would come about in panic or or where thoughts start going in a certain way I believe that we have received of God a word to combat that you believe that but a good word maketh it glad or David said in Psalms 94 19 in the multitude of my thoughts within me that comforts delight my soul now notice David separating thoughts battles the battleground in the multitude the word multitude here would be like a system and a series of branches like you would take maybe this plant right here it's got branches and off of those branches there's little things that start going it's just like the devil's ploy to try to get your mind going in a rat race though you've got to prove something to him you don't have nothing to prove to him come on when you know where you know where you're spending what God has done with in your life he can present all of your faults all your mistakes all your shortcomings he can look at you to a place to where remember even how sister Bruce was sitting there I make so many mistakes how can I possibly be the bride of Jesus Christ but notice what the Prophet does he takes her thoughts and he centers them back to the reality of what Christ has done in her life and then he tells her you're made up this way you get something on your mind he said you've got to go do it for the Lord you have to do it he said Satan will come and stand in the same way and he'll start putting things in your mind it's discerning between those thoughts remember we're talking about being planted in the rivers by the rivers of water drawing from him notice how he would mention this in the multitude of my thoughts within me by comforts delight my soul so David is able to receive from the comforts of the Lord to actually be able to combat when the enemy would come around or when thoughts even even when the enemy maybe would not come around but thoughts about himself how could I be this or how could I be there I think there's one thing that David this scripture has just so meant so much to me David said I have learned not to dwell and think on things too high for me but how the how the how are we thinking on things too high when we're trying to figure it out by our own knowledge when we're trying to reason out God has never made us to live by our reasoning this is a faith walk that is based and rooted in the love of Almighty God so David made a choice in the multitude when my thoughts are running every which way and all these things are springing out like branches that comforts delight my soul you know these are battle instructions here this is delight that we look at you should take delight in its to have something and it's caressed so lovingly to play with affection we're not playing with the word but we are taking the word affectionately into our lives that's what David is writing up here these are battle instructions that's given to us as it was to Joshua this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then thou shalt make that way prosperous and then thou shalt have good success the brown would make a statement in the church age book no believer is more spiritually healthy and victorious than his knowledge of the Word of God and be adherence thereto it's to meditate on it that's to muse on it that's to dwell on it it's to think on in the multitude of my thoughts by comforts delight myself I don't have time this morning but let's look at a few comforts to delight our soul I am redeemed Psalms 107 verse 2 let the redeemed of the Lord say soul whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy this is our promise in the word I'll just said let the redeemed of the Lord think so let him say so I'm redeemed I know that I have not only been bought but I have been brought back to God I'm redeemed notice in Ephesians 2:1 this is a thought I have been quickened I am a new creation in him notice you have he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins where in times past you walked according to the course of this world according to the Prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also we had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and we're by nature the wrath of the children of Wrath even as others I have been quickened evidently God seemed that this was a need because this is not even where I was going to go in these notes today but that thought that scripture begin to just so pulsate in my heart is this morning I got up in the multitude of my thoughts that comfort still like my soul listen we got enough negative trash all around us we've got enough negativity all around us I tell you what be the best thing for people to do is turn off their news channels that'd be the best thing loose em you tell me being that I'd rather be in tune with this world and know about what God's Word is I'd rather have my life built up and faith then to let myself be open to a channel for fear whatever you give yourself to remember spirits travel with word I am righteous in him for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him I'm not righteousness because of me my righteousness is because of him he has lifted me from the life that I was in he brought a change in my life what did that the righteousness of God not I will be I am John 14:26 I have the comforter he is my peace and he gives me peace I just wrote these little words in here above these scriptures will get it sent out to you in John 14:26 the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things is he has he brought comfort to your life you might be in the midst of a trial a situation something you have Jude you're holding right onto a promise of God but yet he's your comfort and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you peace I leave with you my peace I give to you not as the world giveth give I unto you let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid he's my friend he's my buddy Oh you shouldn't say that no no the prophet said it he said Oh God will you let that sinner know of how he said you came down from glory that you might become buddies with us he is my friend a man that had friends must show himself friendly so if you feel like you don't got many friends how friendly are you it's like what people say nobody at the church loves me and you run to your car after every service it's just a trick of the devil that don't mean getting everybody's face either but it means show yourself friendly that might mean sipping this and opening these Oh Lord this was supposed to be comforts that delight my soul he is my friend and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother I'm under his care he adds to my life and watches over me can I just refer to this one this is what we read out of Matthew 6 this is when Luke talking about the birds he who takes care of the birds provides for them what they have need of they are not worrying about oh my goodness am I gonna have strong I wonder if they're gonna have this at the store I wonder is this going to be I wonder who I wonder I wonder what's coming up in the fall I'm wondering you know what you need to do become a bird watcher yeah hey Solomon my inspiration said come on here look at the end come on here look at the ant it could teach a lot of people a lot of things look at the end started looking at the Robbins you know just sit down and look at it a little bit and consider they're not worried they don't think you know they're not taking high blood pressure medicine I'm not saying if you're on and you understand what I'm talking about been there and they're not have caught up in these trivial things they're focused on the purpose that they're here for brother we've got a purpose we've been germanized by the Holy Ghost our purpose is to reflect Jesus Christ in this earth we are ordained for a rapture [Applause] I'm under his care he is the chief attending physician he is my surgeon when I need operated on he's my chiropractor when I need to be cracked back in line he adds to my life it's not me God Lord I'm gonna make this word live I'm gonna make it live in my life I'm gonna that's called frustration that's Satan's Kingdom the God's kingdom is life and peace what should I do just turn it on just sit there when you come to him when you come to church see ya here's the water soaker hose sit down like your Cedar Point buckle in time for the drip to start drip drip drip drip drip drip drip drip drip drip drip drip drip drip drip you walk out of here you walking out flushing he's adding to my life one of the greatest discouragement in the multitude of our thoughts is where we feel like I'm not growing but God comes along and he'll show us the right mirror Satan has those funny mirrors Saint will try to take the word and show you like a little dwarf but when God takes by the Holy Spirit in a gift he'll take that word and brother you might see yourself small but you see a great big God who's on the inside you see greater is He that's in me king is adding to my life [Applause] not what I want to be know what out of me but I know one thing I ain't and I don't care if that in proper English I ain't what I used to be I'm under his care he will finish his work that he started in me being confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ to realize he performs it as we yield I got confidence he'll continue to give me grace to yield he'll give me grace in trials and situations to help me to yield to his outworking most of you know the scripture huh I'm not gonna read this bank of scriptures here but he is my light Psalms 27 he is my light my salvation and my strength I have nothing to be afraid of he sustains me and I shall not be moved cast that burden upon the Lord and he shall sustain thee he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved the amazing thing is is sometimes you feel like you have been moved you feel like you haven't measured up like the stats cliff family brother branham our baby you know it passed away we must Nana had very much faith brother bran sir oh no you had great faith you had great faith he said because even when God said no and God took the baby home you stood great faith is standing on God's promise he sustains me and I shall not be moved he helps me aren't you glad he upholds me he strengthens me Isaiah 41:10 fear thou not for I am with me be not dismayed for I am thy God I will strengthen thee yay I will help thee I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness fear for I the LORD thy God will hold thy right hand sing unto thee fear not I will help thee did you catch this he didn't say I'll take you out of it but my strength will take ahold where your strength yields my hand will take ahold of your right hand and I will say to you fear not I don't want to go through this trial I'm with you I got your hand give me your hand son give me your hand daughter and we put he takes us by his power he doesn't lift us and rapture us out of the problem but he says I'm gonna walk with you through this Lord win will I get a good report when will this come come on let's walk together let's walk together fear not I am your help he's my refuge and strength God Psalms 46 is our refuge and strength a very present help in trouble the Lord is on my side and I'm on his the Lord Psalms 118 verse 6 the Lord is on my side I will not fear what man can do unto me you could try to cancel me I will not fear what man can do unto me the Lord is on my side the Lord taketh my part with them that helped me Oh glory therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me my desire who is it but hates us the devil how is that design that we have going to be placed on him as we're falling in love with the Lord get drawing closer and closer to him now look at this here the angel of the lord encamps about my life and delivers me notice these scriptures these are our promises but it becomes personal he's encamped about my life he delivers me the angel of the Lord in Campus round about them that fear him and deliver them he watches over me this is another one he watches over me and he hears my prayers first Peter 3:12 for the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous and his ears are open unto their prayers I'm completing him his lovers ransom me his love cast out all fear he loves me and I love him you know the Scriptures we would go through there first John for perfect love cast out all fear Meiri justice they come through a few more we you know you could go through this all day long in weeks and weeks and weeks he has given me the Holy Ghost power and I have a sound mind the authority to control myself hello for God hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind I have been placed in Christ last part of Romans 8:15 you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father oh look at this he has called my name I am his and he will see me through every trial that he permits to come my way watch Isaiah 40:31 thus saith the Lord that created the Oh Jacob then formed the Oh Israel fear not for I have redeemed thee I have called thee by thy name thou art when thou passes through the waters I'll be with you through the rivers they'll not overflow you when you walk through the fire they shall not burn neither shall the flame Kindle upon you notice he didn't say you wouldn't go through waters you wouldn't go through rivers fire wouldn't come yet he said when it does come I'll be right there with you you're mine you're under my care I'm seeing you through thy comforts they delight my soul he's with me at all times David said I will fear no evil yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I'll fear and feel no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff comfort me Joshua 1:5 there shalt not any man be able to stand before the all the days of our life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee verse 9 hath not I commanded thee be strong and of a good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord that God is with thee whithersoever thou goest notice God does not say fear dismay of all that it will not say oh he won't be around no but this is what I'm telling you don't be dismayed well what do we have to become against that for the LORD thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest hallelujah this is what happened right Roy Hebrews 13:5 let our conversation be without covetousness such things as you have for he hath said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee so that we may boldly say the Lord is my helper and I will not fear what man shall do unto me Matthew 28:20 and now I'm with you all the way even to the end of the world amen he will perform all his word he will fight for me Deuteronomy 3:21 and I commanded Joshua at that time saying thine eyes have seen all that the Lord your God have done unto these two kings so shall the Lord do unto all the kingdoms whether thou passes ye shall not fear them for the Lord your God he shall fight for you remember that the brand would tell us over and over he says if you go to strike start trying to fight the battle God can't find it let God fight the battle how do I do that give myself into his hands oh my you know the scripture that we love to quote so much who shall separate us from the love of Christ all those conditions that are around and Paul could say nay and all these things were more than conquerors is that right Paul would go on to say I'm persuaded all these other spiritual conditions Heights nor depth nor principalities nor all these spiritual forces that are at work that's what's at work in the unseen realm right now darkness pushing and encroaching and congealing together things that don't even agree why it's pale horse anointing it's gathering together that spirit is culminating together you see that congealing even things that don't even agree with one another but it's darkness gross darkness but in the midst of it I'm persuaded nothing shall be able to separate you say me from the love of God that's in Christ Jesus my Lord it's about personal that comforts delight my soul aren't you glad I won't read Psalms of ninety-one but I'd love to I'm dwelling in the secret place under his protection I'm safe I'm covered by his feathers let's send you it says Matt no no plates shall come now that dwelling that's right I'm dwelling in Christ my soul is sealed my body can get sick come on now it can experience all of that but my soul is safe in Goshen it's safe in the Lord Jesus Christ they're right you remember even when the Asian flu pandemic hit back in 1957 when that pandemic hit it was nowhere near the Spanish flu not a matter of fact there's not been anything close to that of the Spanish flu that hit way back there in the beginning of the 1900s nowhere in comparison but even when the Asian flu it was a pandemic brother Bram tux talks tells us he and a group of brothers were going out west to hunt every one of them came down with the Asian flu they weren't even able to hunt one day they came back came back and rested God raised him up it wasn't exempt from the Asian flu but it couldn't touch the soul what's the main important is is we've already received the vaccination for the soul amen were immune from sin we're immune from the devil's lies we've received the mind of Christ brother let me tell you that's a more necessary vaccine than any vaccine for corona there's people that when they get a vaccine for Corona they'll still be nutty they'll still be crazy they'll still be insane but if they ever get this vaccine of a baptism of the Holy Ghost brother it'll make them love everybody [Applause] it'll put the love of God in their heart and they will protest against sin and unbelief against doubt against disease against sickness they will be equipped with the power that's able to tear down Satan's Kingdom and his divisive schemes that's what this vaccine will do for you this vaccine will make you hate your brother it makes you love your brother [Music] hey man this is the real love of God oh it's not been legislated it's just a life of that constitution from the Lamb's Book of Life that life has come down and quick in that seed germ on the inside and we've been set free from this world then keep going I'm free so when the multitude of thoughts start to come your way what are you going to do that comfort sword delight my soul now you don't have to you you know this is just like a little small core sampling we took out of the scriptures that core sampling brother Haran it means it's loaded down there what I need to do just let it drip in on you saturate me real good and just setting them roots down deeper man this is a trying time did you see them I mean it's a trying time for him and they still got joy everything must go their way no what's the secret their roots spread out their leaves are still green they still got fruit man they must not have any problems in their life this in the fairy tale and in a pipe dream it's a reality when a man or woman is filled with the Holy Ghost they've got a source that they're tapped into then even in the midst of situations that come sometimes we could be so overwhelmed but we have an anchor a resting place to come back to in the multitude of my thoughts that comforts Delight it might be just one of these that you remember but it isn't about you remembering allow God to just quicken them to your heart if there was one thing that we could put
