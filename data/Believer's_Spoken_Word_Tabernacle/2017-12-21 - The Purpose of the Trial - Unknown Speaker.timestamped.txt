[42:56] pray for we ask these things Lord in the
[43:01] precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[43:06] what's your loving Amen let's turn to
[43:11] first Peter chapter 4 verse 12
[43:20] brother Joshua did you give that
[43:23] testimony in did you give you a
[43:25] testimony you didn't would you like to
[43:29] do that let's read the text and then I
[43:32] want you to come and give that with you
[43:39] verse 12 of first Peter chapter 4
[43:50] beloved
[43:53] thinking not strange concerning the
[43:56] fiery trial which is to try as though
[44:00] some strange thing happened unto you but
[44:05] rejoice in as much as you're partakers
[44:08] of Christ's sufferings that when his
[44:11] glory shall be revealed he may be glad
[44:14] also with exceeding joy if you be
[44:18] reproached for the name of Christ happy
[44:21] are ye for the spirit of glory and of
[44:23] God rested upon you on their part that
[44:27] was evil spoken up but on your part he
[44:30] is glorified but let none of you suffer
[44:32] as a murderer or as a thief or as an
[44:36] evildoer
[44:36] or as a busybody in other men's matters
[44:40] yet if any man suffer as a Christian let
[44:44] him not be ashamed but let him glorify
[44:47] God may God bless you bless the reading
[44:53] of his word which microphone use this is
[45:04] what about this one right here this okay
[45:05] is this on
[45:15] it was on all right
[45:23] god bless you
[45:26] maybe you have a hard time understanding
[45:30] yes I do say is I had the issue with my
[45:36] scholarship at school but the problem
[45:40] was like but the squash peas given by a
[45:43] Department of humanities but I am in
[45:46] nursing program so when the schedule
[45:50] were given for the coming spring he came
[45:56] up like conflicting schedule from
[45:59] amenities and nursing so I had to choose
[46:04] either manatees in order to keep the
[46:10] scholarship so in fact I had to have
[46:14] both because the scholarship pays also
[46:18] for nursing so I the day last week I
[46:23] went to see the Department of humanities
[46:27] they said they can do anything so I am
[46:32] going to lose scholarship or I wish
[46:35] choose to leave nursing and stay with
[46:40] humanities and keep scholarship so it's
[46:44] why I didn't have like something to do
[46:47] about that and it was kind of impossible
[46:50] because you can't when the schedule is
[46:52] given you can't change at all at all so
[46:55] he's the rule when I came here we prayed
[46:59] on to the request and the following day
[47:04] I went to meet with the nursing
[47:07] department so the manager of the
[47:12] department allowed that I could change
[47:15] my clinical time in order to get the
[47:19] time freed on Friday so I can tell my
[47:22] humanities class the way he walked out
[47:26] so smoothly you
[47:39] I tell you the the words that that he
[47:46] texts me they're just the other just the
[47:49] other morning on Wednesday after
[47:51] everything I thought was really really
[47:54] something where he said that even what
[47:58] was the established rules God moved you
[48:05] see there's a lot of things and this is
[48:07] you know and I just was I just was
[48:09] praying and just thinking the Lord again
[48:11] just even later last night I just I just
[48:13] took time and I said God I want to thank
[48:16] you because I I know you to be a God of
[48:19] paradoxes and you know it's just
[48:22] something like that that you know it
[48:24] just it just refreshes you you just you
[48:26] see that because as far as all the rules
[48:29] were like brother the brother was
[48:31] explaining here all the rules all the
[48:33] rules said there's no way it can be done
[48:37] but you know that's what a paradox
[48:41] that's a paradise and I believe that
[48:44] that testimony was not just for brother
[48:47] Joshua but I believe that was for all of
[48:50] us I believe that I believe that it's
[48:54] for all of us no matter what it is that
[48:55] you're going through there might be
[48:57] established laws that are against it
[49:00] even the way that the doctors and or
[49:02] whatever it might be that you're facing
[49:04] but God is above all he's greater than
[49:07] all that it doesn't matter how bleak a
[49:09] circumstance looks God is above it all
[49:13] amen
[49:14] don't you just love him just so
[49:18] appreciate that I want to want to look
[49:22] here just a little bit more as we've
[49:23] been dealing with this on on Jacobs life
[49:25] and the pressure that Jacob has
[49:27] experienced in Jacob you know his his
[49:31] reaction is in response to it and you
[49:34] know as we were looking at that of how
[49:36] that God in the midst of it he had spoke
[49:38] to Jacob to come on back home come on
[49:41] back get back to I'm the God of Bethel
[49:44] so Jacob has as some direction within
[49:47] the midst of this time knowing that
[49:49] Jacob is not one who has there's not
[49:52] been a full conversion in his life but
[49:54] he has buddy has met God and he knows
[49:56] God to be there to be a real living God
[50:00] but yet Jacob still has to be changed
[50:03] within his life and but yet when we look
[50:06] at it and you see it how what I've just
[50:08] drawn to in my heart four months ago
[50:10] even and looking at this of how that in
[50:13] the midst of this time God allowed these
[50:15] things to happen to get Jacob back in
[50:19] position and how that God allowed things
[50:22] even with Israel in the natural as we
[50:24] have seen here within the past years how
[50:26] God has allowed things to happen to get
[50:29] Israel in position and I believe that
[50:32] with all my heart that we understand
[50:34] that the things that that God permits to
[50:38] come our way that it are that there are
[50:40] things that God Himself is truly giving
[50:43] that permission but God has a purpose in
[50:46] mind he's not the author of frustration
[50:49] he's not the author of confusion but God
[50:53] himself has a
[50:54] purpose in everything that he allows and
[50:56] permits to come our way and when we we
[51:00] look at this in the word as we would you
[51:02] know revisit this just a little bit and
[51:04] before moving forward here tonight when
[51:07] we we think of how that God would
[51:09] address the the church there in in Samoa
[51:12] and really addressing the entirety of
[51:14] that age God would let it be known that
[51:17] he's aware of what's going on and what
[51:20] things that they are experiencing the
[51:22] tribulation the poverty even that of the
[51:26] blasphemy those things that were
[51:27] continuing within that age but yet God
[51:30] himself would give unto them direction
[51:33] in the midst of that time and in verse
[51:35] 10 he would tell him fear none of those
[51:37] things which thou shalt suffering so God
[51:41] was not his was a nice purpose was not
[51:44] to remove the suffering but yet in the
[51:47] midst of it God was to give them the
[51:50] grace and the strength of what they
[51:52] needed in order to navigate and move
[51:55] through that suffering and to think of
[51:57] it of how God says it here fear none of
[52:00] those things and there's only one thing
[52:01] that can actually overcome fear and
[52:05] dismantle fear and cast it out and
[52:08] that's perfect love that's God's love
[52:11] being revealed and you know when we we
[52:13] look at this and we think about the
[52:15] trial you know even how that God would
[52:19] call our attention to these things as
[52:21] Peter would deal with it in our opening
[52:23] scripture here our conduct during the
[52:27] trial is very much connected to what our
[52:30] expectations are even in our walk as a
[52:34] believer and so sometimes you know
[52:37] expectations which is things that we
[52:39] formed or we thought and we think in our
[52:42] mind and you think of our brother
[52:43] Brennan would would would speak even to
[52:45] where he would say you know he said I
[52:47] think that we have made it as though a
[52:50] flowery bed of ease we've painted things
[52:52] up to where the converts are looking at
[52:55] things he said as though there's not
[52:57] gonna be any troubles there's not going
[52:59] to be any trials but neither when a
[53:01] person comes to Christ does God want you
[53:04] or me say
[53:05] and I'll tell you what you're gonna have
[53:06] that hard oh my it's gonna be bad and
[53:07] I'll tell you it's just gonna be
[53:09] horrible I don't want them kind of
[53:10] people around as a matter of fact that's
[53:13] not a word of etiqueta edification at
[53:15] all to understand I can understand as
[53:18] you can understand that there are tests
[53:20] there are trials just like many of you
[53:22] that are sending you tonight much older
[53:24] than myself and older in the faith you
[53:26] know there's things and experiences that
[53:28] you have come through but yet God
[53:30] Himself is faithful and he has
[53:33] ministered to you and through you in
[53:35] your life and there's really sitting
[53:37] here tonight
[53:38] is there any complaints about serving
[53:40] the Lord is there any regrets about
[53:42] serving the Lord is there any regrets of
[53:44] every test in every trial and any
[53:46] reproach there's no regrets and yet some
[53:49] of you if we could sit down and take
[53:50] individually one by one the testimonies
[53:53] the things that each of you the
[53:55] experiences that we've come through it
[53:57] is absolutely astonishing but remember
[53:59] it's not the highlighting of the flesh
[54:02] because the flesh itself faints the
[54:04] fleet's flesh gets weary but it is
[54:06] Christ himself
[54:08] in us that gives us the strength to
[54:11] press on even when our natural is what
[54:14] we see fail us but yet the spiritual
[54:17] eyes by His grace he is able to look
[54:19] beyond into that unseen realm sometimes
[54:22] when we look at things even when we
[54:24] think of troubles brother Graham tells
[54:25] us in the men in the Hebrew series he
[54:28] said God likes to bring his children
[54:30] into trouble God likes to bring his
[54:33] children into trouble so think of it God
[54:35] could have could have taken him a
[54:37] different route when coming into the
[54:39] promised land but God brought him right
[54:41] to the Red Sea to the natural mind it
[54:44] seems like this is a mistake but it was
[54:46] right in the pathway that God was going
[54:49] to move on the scene and display his
[54:52] delivering hand to his children now you
[54:54] look at it they've already been
[54:56] delivered out of Egypt by a mighty hand
[54:58] and you think about God redeeming them
[55:01] and delivering him in that way but yet
[55:03] God loves to make himself known to you
[55:06] and I and the way that God makes himself
[55:09] known to you and I is sometimes when it
[55:11] comes through circumstances that are
[55:13] entirely impossible through
[55:16] travels through things that will come
[55:18] our way and God will make himself known
[55:20] as a matter of fact I'm not gonna read
[55:22] it tonight but brother em says God will
[55:24] take things out of the nest and cause
[55:26] she said that nest to get into a place
[55:28] to where you're willing to show and step
[55:31] forward he said and it's in that time
[55:33] when he can begin to show you how great
[55:35] he is he said God will allow a
[55:37] depressing spirit to hit a church and he
[55:40] allowed that joy to depart why so that
[55:43] he might truly test us and show how
[55:46] great he really is God will permit those
[55:50] things to test us to show us how great
[55:53] he is but I don't want to dwell on that
[55:56] tonight but yet looking at this aspect
[55:58] and I really want to just deal tonight
[56:00] on that suffering with him because when
[56:03] you look at expectations as brother
[56:05] Branham was talking to us you know and
[56:07] and he talks about how he says you know
[56:09] in this in this time he said life itself
[56:13] everybody wants a life to be easy he
[56:15] said been life wasn't meant to be easy
[56:17] he said anything that has life is a
[56:20] struggle and think of it in this age
[56:23] this aids the objectives that are so set
[56:26] in this age among people and it's the
[56:28] spirit of the age brings the people can
[56:30] do nothing but respond to the spirit and
[56:33] that by God's grace without the grace
[56:35] and mercy of God we would be heavily
[56:38] under the same influence but by His
[56:40] grace we are armed with the Holy Spirit
[56:43] to be able by his grace to discern that
[56:47] spirit absolutely we need God's strength
[56:53] and his guidance so many times because
[56:55] the objective is if I can only get this
[56:58] if I can only do this if I can only do
[57:00] that I will be I'll have it made but yet
[57:03] it's everything is just truly just a
[57:05] facade there's nothing real within all
[57:08] of that it's a promise and people are
[57:10] expending themselves and and giving
[57:13] themselves for what for what for soft
[57:18] easy living and yet the soft easy living
[57:21] is not them not twirling for it but yet
[57:24] they're twirling is for an expectation
[57:26] that I shall have rest I'm glad
[57:29] had that the real rest of God is not
[57:32] something that we would have to buy our
[57:35] own works obtained but the remember
[57:38] laboring to enter into his rest is not
[57:41] our works its yielding to his voice and
[57:44] he brings us into that place of true
[57:48] rest that's a great blessing that's a
[57:52] great blessing God stands here and tells
[57:55] this this church fear none of those
[57:58] things which you shall suffer
[58:01] he already has already let him know
[58:04] they're gonna suffer the devil shall
[58:06] cast you some of you into prison that
[58:08] you may be tried and ye shall have
[58:11] tribulation ten days but be thou
[58:14] faithful unto death and I will give thee
[58:16] a crown of life now notice how that when
[58:20] you know the Prophet will take this in
[58:22] through this particular part in the
[58:25] Simonian age and it begins to deal with
[58:27] what our true expectations because you
[58:29] know true expectations a lot of times
[58:32] are there things that we can craft and
[58:34] form even in our imagination of what we
[58:37] think what is true and what's reality
[58:40] you know remember how that that Paul
[58:42] would allow it to be that we should not
[58:44] he said you should not think of us more
[58:46] highly than you ought to think even how
[58:48] that God would allow James to bring that
[58:50] around so that people were not thinking
[58:53] that prophets were just you know more
[58:55] than men and they never had problems
[58:57] they never had discouragements but yet
[58:59] God allowed James to write that part and
[59:01] point out those things that were there
[59:04] so what so our real expectation because
[59:07] you know when our expectations are not
[59:10] right it hinders our conduct when the
[59:13] person's expectations does not intend us
[59:17] not match the expectations what they've
[59:19] expected it's frustration and it affects
[59:22] the conduct in you you think of that of
[59:24] how that even when you look at you know
[59:26] in the scriptures and I was just
[59:28] thinking even you know this week earlier
[59:30] and this week looking over this again
[59:32] of how that even in the midst of the
[59:34] marriage ceremony there are vowels
[59:36] within there the vowels that are we
[59:38] and that married ceremony that the
[59:40] majority of those vowels are not vowels
[59:43] that everything is going to be easy and
[59:45] everything is gonna be peachy and
[59:47] everything's gonna be flowery but the
[59:49] reality of those vowels and those things
[59:51] that are laid bare it lets it know that
[59:53] there is going to be a molding and a
[59:55] growing together and are uniting not
[59:58] just through the times that are good but
[1:00:01] through the suffering there's going to
[1:00:03] be growing through misunderstanding
[1:00:05] there's gonna be growing through drought
[1:00:07] that's when love really shows itself are
[1:00:12] you with me because you see we're
[1:00:14] talking about a spiritual union with the
[1:00:17] Lord Jesus Christ when you think about
[1:00:19] it now you look around you know the
[1:00:21] church look around the assembly and you
[1:00:23] can look around in other places and you
[1:00:25] see a husband and wife and you see the
[1:00:27] reflection that is there you know of
[1:00:30] Christ and and and the bride within that
[1:00:32] within that marriage but to recognize
[1:00:35] that that Union and that marriage of
[1:00:37] what you see now was not something that
[1:00:39] was just given at the altar of all the
[1:00:43] pronouncing of or pronouncing of vows it
[1:00:45] is that that's not what gave that
[1:00:47] marriage what it is but the marriage
[1:00:49] itself in that thing which we see and
[1:00:52] cherish is because of the union that has
[1:00:55] taken place and through the molding and
[1:00:57] the shaping of hardships of testings of
[1:01:00] trials of wonderings
[1:01:02] of all of those things it makes that
[1:01:05] marriage somebody with me tonight my but
[1:01:10] you know I wonder where the happily ever
[1:01:12] after but you know I don't want to just
[1:01:16] so deal on that that's no doubt in
[1:01:18] another service but you know the
[1:01:20] scripture said unto death be faithful
[1:01:23] not on til there's no stopping point
[1:01:26] unto death death is only the vehicle to
[1:01:31] bring us into the Friends of God the one
[1:01:33] that we've walked with the one that
[1:01:35] we've loved the one that has cared for
[1:01:37] us in this journey we see him face to
[1:01:41] face death only brings us into that
[1:01:45] place of waiting and move
[1:01:47] from this dimension into that dimension
[1:01:50] from this address into that address from
[1:01:52] this pest house into that house not made
[1:01:54] with hands that's the grace of God death
[1:01:58] is the grace of God to us so to think of
[1:02:03] it of how that you know in these things
[1:02:06] of how that God he doesn't hold back
[1:02:08] persecution he doesn't hold back trauma
[1:02:11] I understand that there's things that
[1:02:13] when we look at it in the natural marry
[1:02:14] there's things that we could bring
[1:02:16] troubles our own self there's things
[1:02:19] that we can do and it would bring
[1:02:20] troubles and calls trouble I understand
[1:02:22] that that's the same way that Peter is
[1:02:24] dealing with right here in the
[1:02:25] scriptures there's things that people
[1:02:27] can actually bring on themselves in
[1:02:29] serving the Lord where it's not they're
[1:02:32] not suffering for the cause of Christ
[1:02:33] they're suffering for their own
[1:02:35] fanaticism I hope you understand what
[1:02:38] I'm saying you know when this one you
[1:02:41] look brother around says it like this
[1:02:42] and by faith Moses in 1958 he said I
[1:02:45] want you to notice how then Moses
[1:02:46] himself he saw that the you know the the
[1:02:50] afflictions but yet he was able to look
[1:02:52] and he was able to look past them
[1:02:54] afflictions and see that these were of
[1:02:55] people with promise program says I don't
[1:02:58] say that you're to seek after suffering
[1:03:00] he said but suffering comes along with
[1:03:03] it he said but you know it's not us
[1:03:05] going and making ourselves something and
[1:03:07] then suffering because we've made our
[1:03:10] self odd because that's not suffering on
[1:03:12] the count of Christ you understand what
[1:03:13] I'm saying you see with fanaticism when
[1:03:16] people become fanatics with things you
[1:03:18] know I know there are some things that
[1:03:19] was going on here not too long ago in
[1:03:21] another place north of here and you had
[1:03:23] men that were standing on the streets
[1:03:25] and saying all sorts of stuff to women
[1:03:27] coming by and they were saying things
[1:03:29] you know that well you know that this is
[1:03:31] what's said and everything they when
[1:03:32] people begin the news begin to tie that
[1:03:34] in to that of a message of brother
[1:03:37] Branham because that's what these
[1:03:38] individuals said they stood for but I'll
[1:03:40] tell you right now they don't stand for
[1:03:42] the same message I stand for because
[1:03:44] then that is not representative of the
[1:03:46] same character that has delivered this
[1:03:48] the character of Christ and I'll say it
[1:03:50] like this the things that they would
[1:03:52] receive they justly deserve for the
[1:03:55] fanaticism that they
[1:03:57] I hope you understand what I'm saying
[1:03:59] you see there is a right way and
[1:04:01] suffering for Christ but then there's a
[1:04:03] place and there's a part where people
[1:04:05] can actually through their own ways and
[1:04:07] the things that they would do making
[1:04:09] themselves off can bring suffering on
[1:04:12] their selves and it's not even suffering
[1:04:14] for the cause of Christ it's because of
[1:04:17] of that which is just them making
[1:04:20] themselves off we don't need to make
[1:04:21] ourselves nothing all we need to do is
[1:04:24] walk faithfully with him you understand
[1:04:28] what I'm saying
[1:04:29] so understanding God's love is very very
[1:04:32] essential because as we looked at it
[1:04:35] last week that you know the love of God
[1:04:37] as brother branham picks this up here he
[1:04:40] deals with how that God's love that
[1:04:43] Israel themselves thought God's love to
[1:04:47] be that of justa a parental love that
[1:04:50] meant no suffering that's what they
[1:04:53] thought so they're questioning question
[1:04:56] of God of the things that are taking
[1:04:58] place and God directs them to the proof
[1:05:01] of his love and the proof of his love is
[1:05:05] not that God is saying well this has
[1:05:07] happened to this nation and this has
[1:05:09] happened to this nation and look what
[1:05:10] I've done for you but God directs their
[1:05:13] love - I have chosen here I have chosen
[1:05:18] you that in itself is there is the full
[1:05:23] finality of the love of God because
[1:05:26] God's love does not mean that there's no
[1:05:28] suffering even when God will leads you
[1:05:32] and I in his will his will being in his
[1:05:34] will does not mean that there's no
[1:05:36] suffering as a matter of fact it is a
[1:05:38] great blessing and it proves itself what
[1:05:41] it is to know you're in God's will
[1:05:43] because you will be tested and tried
[1:05:48] that's why it's a blessing to know you
[1:05:51] are in God's will because then you are
[1:05:53] able to stand there when everything
[1:05:55] would come against you
[1:05:57] you're able to stand there and say I
[1:05:59] don't know the next move but I know
[1:06:02] where I'm standing
[1:06:03] here's where God would have me to stand
[1:06:05] right now
[1:06:07] [Applause]
[1:06:10] that's a blessing so when we think of it
[1:06:15] of halibut you know there's sometimes
[1:06:16] there's things in our life that just
[1:06:18] don't go our way
[1:06:20] there's things sometimes and you know
[1:06:22] when it looks at it when we would look
[1:06:25] put it all out in and we list the things
[1:06:28] of all the reasons why it should go away
[1:06:30] it might be ever so stacked in our favor
[1:06:33] but yet it doesn't go our way things
[1:06:38] don't happen it might seem sure the
[1:06:40] world I'm gonna get this jump promotion
[1:06:42] around and this is going to happen or
[1:06:44] that's gonna happen and it doesn't
[1:06:45] happen and yet in the midst of it those
[1:06:49] are things we can't understand we can't
[1:06:54] but we do know this we do know this then
[1:06:58] all things work together for the good to
[1:07:03] them that are called according to his
[1:07:05] purpose I may not understand you see all
[1:07:08] things work together I may not
[1:07:10] understand this right here but when this
[1:07:12] comes together with another part then
[1:07:15] the understanding can come here stands
[1:07:20] Joseph Joseph is standing there he
[1:07:22] doesn't know what's going on when he's
[1:07:24] down in Egypt well I'm down here you
[1:07:26] know I'm just waiting on a famine to
[1:07:27] come he doesn't know that but oh how
[1:07:31] when he stands there at the latter time
[1:07:33] as he reveals himself to his brethren he
[1:07:36] has received that understanding within
[1:07:39] that time he's received molding and
[1:07:42] shaping of God to trust God that God
[1:07:45] will bring to pass what God has shown
[1:07:48] him and by trusting the Lord
[1:07:51] there has been molding there has been
[1:07:53] shaping to where that Joseph is able to
[1:07:56] stand there and says I don't hate you I
[1:07:58] don't dislike you ha and they and they
[1:08:01] know hey he's just to do it but he what
[1:08:04] is it Joseph has received cleansing and
[1:08:07] washing in his life from trusting in the
[1:08:11] Lord and God moving
[1:08:13] like the Bible said that the word of the
[1:08:16] Lord tried him pay men and here Joseph
[1:08:22] is able to stand there at that time and
[1:08:23] said don't be angry with yourselves
[1:08:28] where he said God has sent me ahead see
[1:08:33] an understanding that he had already
[1:08:35] come to and that understanding had
[1:08:37] cleansed and removed that's the grace of
[1:08:43] God this is this is all of those things
[1:08:46] even to where brother Branham could tell
[1:08:48] us regarding Joseph's life in Paula
[1:08:51] prisoner where the brem says there was
[1:08:53] too much pride still there still must
[1:08:57] still that had to be worked out in his
[1:08:59] life those things yet being in the midst
[1:09:02] of that prison and those times it worked
[1:09:04] out what needed to be worked out I want
[1:09:08] you to think of this if he had not been
[1:09:09] in that position and then where he was
[1:09:12] down there within those prison within
[1:09:15] all those things we were never read of
[1:09:18] the furtherance of it now you see God
[1:09:20] could and I look at it if we take it in
[1:09:21] a parent away God could have done it in
[1:09:23] such a way and said well Joseph has he
[1:09:27] not revealed to Joseph already about the
[1:09:29] sheaves bowing down sure could he not
[1:09:32] have revealed to Joseph don't go with
[1:09:33] them today don't go with them today you
[1:09:36] know how they are don't go with them God
[1:09:40] could have done that but there had to be
[1:09:42] something about it that would actually
[1:09:45] allow Joseph to go ahead and go and you
[1:09:50] mean God would permit that God wouldn't
[1:09:53] give a warning out about that no if God
[1:09:58] had gave a warning it would have messed
[1:10:00] that type right up it would have messed
[1:10:03] up the fulfillment of what it was now
[1:10:05] listen him growing all that entrapment
[1:10:07] that wasn't against God's will that was
[1:10:10] only bringing Joseph into position if he
[1:10:13] would have remained in the land he never
[1:10:15] could have helped but because through
[1:10:18] the midst of it he was able to submit
[1:10:20] himself through suffering then through
[1:10:23] his suffering he was able to stand in
[1:10:25] that
[1:10:26] and be able to minister life to them so
[1:10:32] everything that God permits to come our
[1:10:34] way is with the purpose all the testings
[1:10:38] and all the times we don't always know
[1:10:40] the purpose and I'll tell you right now
[1:10:42] we don't know the purpose but what we do
[1:10:46] know is he's not the author of
[1:10:48] frustration or confusion we know that he
[1:10:52] is the author and within this God
[1:10:55] permits with a purpose and to think of
[1:10:59] how that brother Graham picks us up like
[1:11:01] this in a Simonian age he said how he
[1:11:04] says thinking not strange concerning the
[1:11:06] fiery trials that are to try you he said
[1:11:09] that's what Peter said is it strange
[1:11:12] that God wants us to develop a
[1:11:15] christ-like character that comes through
[1:11:18] suffering now to think of these words to
[1:11:22] develop to develop a christ-like
[1:11:26] character that comes through suffering
[1:11:31] to think of how that God would ask and
[1:11:35] require of us to develop how are things
[1:11:37] to vet to develop means to grow it means
[1:11:41] to mature is that right you look at
[1:11:44] certain certain things of development
[1:11:46] that that comes about within a child or
[1:11:49] within our lives then there is a certain
[1:11:51] measure of trust that's deposited in us
[1:11:53] right there's certain things that would
[1:11:56] come our way that it can be tested or
[1:11:58] come to where that it will show whether
[1:12:00] it's trustworthy or not whether the
[1:12:02] maturity is there or not
[1:12:04] so his desire is to develop a
[1:12:06] christ-like character and I also look at
[1:12:08] this word developed because develop is
[1:12:10] likened to that of a picture where that
[1:12:12] you have a picture that's being
[1:12:15] developed but a picture now I'm not
[1:12:17] talking about these digital kind but I'm
[1:12:20] talking about pictures you know and I
[1:12:21] was still in high school we had a room
[1:12:23] an actual photography class that you
[1:12:26] actually had in a big camera it was
[1:12:28] located in a room you had to go in a
[1:12:30] locked door and through another locked
[1:12:31] door it was in a big room and was a
[1:12:33] massive camera we had to film that was
[1:12:35] that sheets and you know the big sheets
[1:12:37] like that
[1:12:38] and we
[1:12:38] to go in there and take a picture and
[1:12:40] there's certain things that we had to do
[1:12:42] with projects in that class but after
[1:12:44] taking that then that picture itself we
[1:12:47] actually would have to hang that picture
[1:12:49] up we had to go through a process of
[1:12:51] dipping it in certain acids and we could
[1:12:54] only do it for a certain period of time
[1:12:56] we couldn't leave it too long in this
[1:12:58] time because there's certain parts of
[1:13:00] silver that will begin to override the
[1:13:03] image so we had to leave it in this
[1:13:05] particular solution it's called a bath
[1:13:07] this thing is called a bath and you
[1:13:10] would lower this film in there and you
[1:13:12] would watch the watch there okay now
[1:13:13] this time you take it up you put it in
[1:13:15] this one this is a certain rinse then
[1:13:17] you and after that you hang it up and
[1:13:19] then after hanging it up then you would
[1:13:21] move it into another bath all of those
[1:13:23] were processes filled with acids that
[1:13:26] would actually be able to call certain
[1:13:29] parts of that film to be developed and
[1:13:31] other parts to be retained to hold their
[1:13:34] shape and then other parts that would
[1:13:36] actually begin to highlight the color
[1:13:38] that was in there without those acids
[1:13:41] the picture that was taken would never
[1:13:43] be able to be developed and the picture
[1:13:46] that God has taken of us before the
[1:13:49] foundation of the world let me tell you
[1:13:51] this in order to take a picture there's
[1:13:53] got to be an image to take a picture of
[1:13:54] hey man your theophany was not just
[1:13:58] created but it was always there in the
[1:14:01] presence of Almighty and there is a
[1:14:03] picture that was taken of you and
[1:14:05] through that picture then with that see
[1:14:07] as you come into this earth is deposited
[1:14:10] in your life and then through that
[1:14:12] deposit in your life when you come into
[1:14:14] the quickening by the Spirit of Almighty
[1:14:17] God then begins the process of
[1:14:19] developing a christ-like character so
[1:14:24] the new birth is not christ-like
[1:14:26] character it only empowers you with the
[1:14:29] life that's needed to submit yourself
[1:14:32] for developing is that right because
[1:14:41] when we look at this brother Ram goes on
[1:14:43] to tell us now he says we all have
[1:14:46] trials is that right
[1:14:49] we are all tried and chastened as sons
[1:14:53] not one but goes through that the church
[1:14:57] that is not suffering and it's not being
[1:15:00] tried hasn't got it it isn't of God slat
[1:15:07] the truth the church that's not
[1:15:09] suffering I know that it can be you know
[1:15:14] that their kaminnikov world and
[1:15:16] everything else can look at it well
[1:15:17] we're suffering you know they're the
[1:15:19] abortion and all these other things are
[1:15:20] going on and and you know what there is
[1:15:23] all there is suffering but yet the
[1:15:25] suffering that we're talking about is
[1:15:27] that suffering that is that is walking
[1:15:29] in the very life of Jesus Christ this is
[1:15:35] a suffering we're talking about it is a
[1:15:37] suffering look to where that even the
[1:15:39] political world can look at it and they
[1:15:42] can disagree and say well why don't you
[1:15:43] stand for this and why don't you stand
[1:15:45] for this but yet when it comes down to
[1:15:47] it and they look at not only the stand
[1:15:49] that you are not by the Word of God
[1:15:51] would have on such things but even the
[1:15:53] standard of holiness that you and I
[1:15:56] would hold by God's grace the world
[1:15:59] itself looks upon and what does it do by
[1:16:01] the promise that we hold in our life it
[1:16:04] actually causes a congealing of the
[1:16:07] darkness together because the light
[1:16:09] itself being reflected through our life
[1:16:11] it actually causes them to unite in
[1:16:14] those things even though they don't
[1:16:16] agree with one another
[1:16:18] they'll unite in principle against a
[1:16:20] real standard of Christ's own life yet
[1:16:23] claiming to have his life that's
[1:16:26] suffering that's suffering you see it's
[1:16:30] not just suffering for those as you walk
[1:16:33] around and you have somebody on the
[1:16:35] street a drunkard or a prostitute or
[1:16:37] whomever more and they thank you crazy
[1:16:39] but it's to walk around with people on
[1:16:42] that walk within religious circles and
[1:16:44] they walk within it and they call you
[1:16:47] crazy they look at you you've lost your
[1:16:51] mind but you see friends all they can
[1:16:53] see is they look at though you are doing
[1:16:56] this by your own strength they do not
[1:16:58] see and recognize that this is
[1:17:01] not something that I'm doing by my own
[1:17:03] strength this is a love affair this is a
[1:17:06] relationship I don't have to do this by
[1:17:09] God's grace he has revealed himself to
[1:17:12] me I desire to do those things if
[1:17:14] there's something in his word that I
[1:17:16] don't know but I should know I want to
[1:17:18] know so that I can submit my life to it
[1:17:24] so when we look at this of how that the
[1:17:27] suffering in Hebrews 12 verse 6 the Paul
[1:17:30] says for whom the Lord loveth he chasing
[1:17:33] it now I want you to just think of this
[1:17:35] word here for a moment because sometimes
[1:17:37] we look at the term chastening and we
[1:17:40] think of the word chastening is always
[1:17:42] getting a whuppin that's not what a
[1:17:44] chastening is all about there is times
[1:17:47] of chastening where there's correction
[1:17:48] and Paul brings it out the next time of
[1:17:50] scourging but you realize that
[1:17:51] chastening itself is also an
[1:17:54] admonishment
[1:17:56] will speak to us and guide us and speak
[1:18:00] of certain things that we are to avoid
[1:18:02] this now watch out for this God will
[1:18:04] chasten and direct our lives sometimes
[1:18:07] the chastening is not so much what is
[1:18:09] said here but we can actually receive
[1:18:12] chastening of the Lord by the
[1:18:14] experiences that God has allowed to come
[1:18:17] through their lives understand it comes
[1:18:22] through that direction and that guidance
[1:18:24] now think of this and scourgeth every
[1:18:27] son whom he receiveth
[1:18:30] so one whom he receiveth his one that he
[1:18:33] acknowledges as his own these are the
[1:18:37] ones he acknowledges as his own
[1:18:39] if ye endure chastening God dealeth with
[1:18:43] you as with sons for what son is he whom
[1:18:47] the father chase and if not but if you
[1:18:49] be without chastisement whereof all are
[1:18:52] partakers then are you bastards and not
[1:18:55] sons so if you endure chastening this is
[1:19:00] how God deals with you enduring the
[1:19:03] chastening all of them and mana schmitz
[1:19:06] everything the correction that comes our
[1:19:08] way
[1:19:08] the reproof that comes our way all of
[1:19:10] that that comes our way
[1:19:11] does our flesh
[1:19:13] rejoice in that no it does not I'll say
[1:19:17] a man for you your flesh does not
[1:19:19] rejoice in coming neither does mine
[1:19:21] coming and getting cuddle but the inner
[1:19:25] man is being set free it's not cutting
[1:19:29] the inner man its setting free the inner
[1:19:32] man it's giving you and I the inner man
[1:19:35] authority and say ha ha ah you caught at
[1:19:38] it right now it gives us strength and
[1:19:43] I'll tell you what we need correction we
[1:19:46] need that correction from the Lord but
[1:19:50] just as much as we need correction from
[1:19:52] the Lord
[1:19:52] we need admonition - I don't know about
[1:19:56] you but I don't want to just be
[1:19:57] corrected all the time
[1:19:58] don't take me wrong friends I I love I
[1:20:01] thank God for his correction but I
[1:20:03] believe that God has more than just
[1:20:06] correcting you and I I want correction
[1:20:08] when I need correction but I just don't
[1:20:11] want to be corrected for the same thing
[1:20:12] over and over I want to grow up if I've
[1:20:17] been corrected about something I want to
[1:20:19] grow help me to grow speak to me about
[1:20:22] things that will help me to grow teach
[1:20:24] me on how that I can grow because none
[1:20:27] of us come here saying praise God I'm
[1:20:30] ready for that same whoopin again none
[1:20:35] of us are so here if you be without
[1:20:42] chastisement so this is not to receive
[1:20:45] it to actually be a partaker of it so if
[1:20:48] we're not a partaker of it how are we
[1:20:50] not a part a kinnor of chastisement when
[1:20:52] we do not receive it and allow it to
[1:20:55] move and shape and mold in our lives and
[1:20:58] bring forth watch how he says this in
[1:21:03] simonia church age he said this special
[1:21:06] condition in sir Myrna must be applied
[1:21:10] to every age there is no age free from
[1:21:13] it there's no true believer free from a
[1:21:16] dishes of God this is the will of God it
[1:21:19] is needful we need the Lord to teach us
[1:21:23] the truth that we are to suffer and be
[1:21:26] like in doing it and brother branham
[1:21:30] refers to a scripture right there at
[1:21:33] first Corinthians 13 7 of how the
[1:21:35] charity it beareth all things believeth
[1:21:39] all things it hope of all things and it
[1:21:43] endureth all things
[1:21:47] don't send me what does that mean that
[1:21:49] charity just didn't say there it is this
[1:21:54] isn't going how I thought I should go
[1:21:56] this in the way that I think it should
[1:21:58] go the charity Bharath Bharath is that
[1:22:01] when it does not even understand but
[1:22:05] charity beareth all things charity also
[1:22:11] believeth all things everything that God
[1:22:14] has said no matter if I see it or I feel
[1:22:17] it right now but God has said he is
[1:22:19] faithful to perform and that's where
[1:22:21] we're hopeful for all things I hope you
[1:22:24] understand me tonight love itself does
[1:22:26] not have an expectation of evil love has
[1:22:30] an expectation of God love does not have
[1:22:35] an expectation of our doomed this is my
[1:22:38] in this is that's not love that's not
[1:22:40] the love of God that's our love but
[1:22:43] remember his love is an unconditional
[1:22:45] love they meant he is love with in our
[1:22:50] lives that even when we ourselves have
[1:22:52] no way or nothing to put a stock of Hope
[1:22:56] in but yet in the midst of it there is
[1:22:58] hope from our soul hope expectation I
[1:23:04] don't know about you but have you ever
[1:23:06] come into service you've been down
[1:23:08] you've been discouraged but you said God
[1:23:10] if I can just make it to the house of
[1:23:12] God I know if I can just get fair lord I
[1:23:15] believe I'll leave out of there
[1:23:17] different what is that hope it's hope
[1:23:20] you've got an expectation I don't know
[1:23:23] how but I know that God will give me
[1:23:26] strength
[1:23:27] and direction for this and endureth all
[1:23:32] things
[1:23:32] this is where the Lord Jesus would take
[1:23:35] the time and telling the disciples in
[1:23:38] Matthew 5:11 12 think of these things
[1:23:41] that he drops all along the way in his
[1:23:43] earthly ministry these these parts that
[1:23:46] are left here all along the way but have
[1:23:49] it no doubt they didn't capture this
[1:23:51] they didn't capture it for themselves
[1:23:53] because you know why they didn't see
[1:23:56] themselves or see him as having to
[1:23:58] suffer you see they did not identify him
[1:24:02] that he would have to suffer yet they
[1:24:03] fought that he was indeed to be the
[1:24:05] Redeemer but yet they didn't realize in
[1:24:07] order to redeem he'd have to suffer but
[1:24:12] then after after being made him face to
[1:24:16] face then these things God would make
[1:24:19] real to her God would have it where
[1:24:22] Peter think of how Peter how Peter would
[1:24:25] be so led by the Spirit of God be it to
[1:24:27] be so instrumental to see the very the
[1:24:30] very parts of there in the trial and
[1:24:32] those things of how that even when the
[1:24:34] Lord Jesus himself was being taken and
[1:24:37] Peter himself was able to be captivated
[1:24:40] at that moment even though he was
[1:24:42] running from it even though he was
[1:24:43] trying to do everything to prevent it
[1:24:45] but yet there was a measure of it but
[1:24:47] the Spirit of God after Peter was
[1:24:49] converted would bring back to his
[1:24:51] attentiveness to where that Peter could
[1:24:53] be able to write about the image of
[1:24:56] Christ not about what he looked like
[1:24:58] defeat but he would be able to portray
[1:25:00] the greatest victory of how that a
[1:25:03] character had rose and become perfected
[1:25:06] and was able to stand there in the midst
[1:25:09] of the greatest testing and trials upon
[1:25:12] this earth God would allow those things
[1:25:14] to come back to him think of this how
[1:25:18] the scripture says blessed are ye when
[1:25:20] men shall revile you and persecute you
[1:25:23] and shall say all manner of evil against
[1:25:25] you falsely for my sake rejoice and be
[1:25:29] exceeding glad for great is your reward
[1:25:32] in heaven for so persecuted they the
[1:25:36] prophets which were before you
[1:25:42] notice this when we take of suffering
[1:25:45] let's look at this a little bit in the
[1:25:46] life of the Lord Jesus because as he is
[1:25:49] the groom he is the Redeemer and we as
[1:25:53] the redeemed then he will not ask of us
[1:25:56] to go through something that he himself
[1:25:58] has not went through and that he himself
[1:26:01] having that perfect confidence in the
[1:26:04] display of this life that this life in
[1:26:07] itself within our lives is able to
[1:26:10] preserve us and not just preserve us but
[1:26:13] that we would have joy in the midst of
[1:26:16] our trials hebrews chapter 2 verse 10
[1:26:21] for it became him for whom are all
[1:26:23] things and by whom are all things in
[1:26:25] bringing many sons unto glory to make
[1:26:28] the captain of their salvation perfect
[1:26:30] through sufferings now the life that was
[1:26:36] within him the Spirit of God was
[1:26:39] absolutely perfect but the very
[1:26:42] character had to be perfected see what
[1:26:46] God is setting forth here is this is
[1:26:49] what every son and daughter must come to
[1:26:52] is this perfection so it's not just
[1:26:55] being born of the Spirit of God that is
[1:26:57] essential that is number one
[1:26:59] that is what Redemption is all about but
[1:27:01] in that process of redemption there is a
[1:27:03] development to where that which God has
[1:27:06] birthed and brought forth there is a
[1:27:07] development and a growth just like it is
[1:27:10] within that of children coming forth we
[1:27:13] don't leave children just to their own
[1:27:14] selves we train them is that right teach
[1:27:17] a child in the way it should go
[1:27:19] Paul tells us that were to admonish them
[1:27:21] it means teaching the full counsel and
[1:27:23] all those things that they would
[1:27:25] experience and they would see and also
[1:27:27] the correction that's to come but to see
[1:27:29] all of that is a perfecting but how that
[1:27:32] God himself was able and willingly
[1:27:35] subjected himself to this suffering he
[1:27:42] didn't have to but by the way of his
[1:27:46] coming he subjected himself to this
[1:27:50] suffering
[1:27:53] what love Hebrews 5:8 though he were a
[1:27:58] son yet learned he obedience by the
[1:28:04] things which he suffered it was in
[1:28:07] disobedient but he learned he actually
[1:28:11] was taught came to an understanding of
[1:28:13] what it meant to be fully submissive
[1:28:19] that's powerful because you realize real
[1:28:23] obedience requires full submission it's
[1:28:29] a training it's a teaching that goes on
[1:28:31] in our life because sometimes our
[1:28:32] feelings are going in a different
[1:28:35] direction
[1:28:35] here he is at the very final moments
[1:28:38] there in the Garden of Gethsemane and he
[1:28:41] asked if it's possible let this cup pass
[1:28:45] from me what's it doing learning
[1:28:49] obedience by the things that he suffered
[1:28:52] he's been suffering all all but he's
[1:28:54] learning obedience this is not an act
[1:28:58] this is not an act when Jesus was
[1:29:00] tempted it wasn't an act it was real the
[1:29:04] Bible said he suffered that means to be
[1:29:07] vexed undergo a sensible experience in
[1:29:10] that he was tempted he was pulled
[1:29:12] but God was able God was able to come
[1:29:16] down and so live through that humanity
[1:29:19] that body that he had created bringing
[1:29:22] it forth in the virgin birth God was
[1:29:24] able to so live through that body to
[1:29:26] where he could feel what it felt like to
[1:29:30] be obedient he can feel the pool that
[1:29:34] would come upon the flesh and upon the
[1:29:36] spirit he's so lived that he could
[1:29:39] experience that you say why would he do
[1:29:41] it so that he could be able to minister
[1:29:44] as a faithful and merciful high priest
[1:29:46] and to be the right kind of an
[1:29:48] intercessor for you and me he didn't do
[1:29:53] it for himself he wanted to understand
[1:29:56] you and
[1:29:57] he didn't have to have a headache he
[1:30:00] didn't have to get sick but God would so
[1:30:03] subject himself to allow sickness to
[1:30:06] come to his body the Prophet picks that
[1:30:09] up to where that he had a headache and
[1:30:11] he groaned aloud suffering you see what
[1:30:21] would it have been if we could read here
[1:30:23] about our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[1:30:25] our Redeemer and yet we would see no
[1:30:28] suffering we would see that everybody in
[1:30:30] the religious realms loved him we would
[1:30:35] see that whole when people asked him
[1:30:37] questions he was always willing to
[1:30:39] answer no he wasn't as a matter of fact
[1:30:42] he walked away from a lot of questions
[1:30:44] hey men he was escorted out of certain
[1:30:47] things he avoided certain things why it
[1:30:49] was the wisdom of God you understand
[1:30:53] that's why it's important to know how
[1:30:54] what we're pouring our energies into you
[1:30:57] can be pouring your energies into an
[1:30:58] empty bucket and it goes right out the
[1:31:00] bottom come on friends with me we don't
[1:31:04] have time to mess around with our
[1:31:05] energies in our time we've got to be
[1:31:07] country inches to work while it's day
[1:31:10] four the night cometh they men mindful
[1:31:13] that it's not just you know things here
[1:31:15] and there but yet there must be a
[1:31:16] purpose and God helped me and direct me
[1:31:19] Lord to where my time is used to your
[1:31:21] glory and being made perfect Wow coming
[1:31:27] to full maturity full completion the
[1:31:31] journey of his life he became the author
[1:31:33] of eternal salvation unto all them that
[1:31:36] obey Him called of God and high priest
[1:31:38] after the order of Melchizedek look how
[1:31:41] Peter picks us up in 1st Peter chapter 2
[1:31:43] verse 18 servants be subject to your
[1:31:46] masters with all fear and not only to
[1:31:49] the good and gentle but also to the
[1:31:52] froward masters would that be like
[1:31:55] bosses and
[1:32:01] for this is think worthy if a man for
[1:32:05] conscience toward God endure grief
[1:32:08] suffering wrongfully for what glory is
[1:32:11] it when you'd be buffeted for your
[1:32:14] faults you shall take it patiently
[1:32:15] anybody in here buffeted for your faults
[1:32:17] I got both my hands up from all Lord I'm
[1:32:22] full of them and so are you now even
[1:32:26] when we're buffeted for our faults we
[1:32:28] can get a little edgy I say a man for
[1:32:31] them Lord nobody in here loves criticism
[1:32:37] nobody nobody says praise God brother
[1:32:40] George come on over brother and
[1:32:41] criticize me no sir if you feel out that
[1:32:45] he's coming over to criticize you you
[1:32:46] will run the opposite way your flesh our
[1:32:49] flesh will do that is that right so then
[1:32:53] even within this here what Peter is
[1:32:55] saying hey when you're being buffeted
[1:32:57] for your faults you're not suffering for
[1:33:00] Christ I'll tell you they came over and
[1:33:06] I got so upset at them I got so mad and
[1:33:09] I'll tell you what they made me they
[1:33:11] penalize me on my check I'm suffering
[1:33:13] for the glory god no you're not
[1:33:14] suffering for the glory of God
[1:33:15] you're suffering for your own ignorance
[1:33:19] come on somebody let's stop playing like
[1:33:24] like we're laying it as trophies on
[1:33:26] behalf of the Lord but if when you do
[1:33:30] well and suffer for it you take it
[1:33:33] patiently you mean this has to be taught
[1:33:40] this isn't just something that's just
[1:33:42] automatic yes but the teaching goes
[1:33:48] deeper than just the words but I'm so
[1:33:51] glad that God gives words so that we
[1:33:53] don't think it's strange God makes sense
[1:33:59] of what we cannot make sense of this is
[1:34:03] acceptable to God for even even hereunto
[1:34:06] were you called because Christ also
[1:34:08] suffered for us leaving us an example
[1:34:10] that ye should follow his
[1:34:12] steps who did no sin neither was guile
[1:34:15] found in his mouth who when he was
[1:34:17] reviled got on Facebook and made his
[1:34:21] point no came back to church and acted
[1:34:23] like everything was alright and greeted
[1:34:24] everybody with a hug and a kiss and when
[1:34:27] he got out of that service he went back
[1:34:28] to Facebook and pasted posted his hurt
[1:34:32] hello oh no brother said I never say
[1:34:36] nothing like that when your fingers say
[1:34:38] it it's your heart that's coming out
[1:34:39] whether you say it to a person's face or
[1:34:42] you say it on a blog or a post you're
[1:34:43] guilty before God I'm telling you right
[1:34:47] now gets a high accountability you know
[1:34:50] it'd be better for some folks because if
[1:34:51] they Benton they can't keep their
[1:34:53] fingers off of their and they can't keep
[1:34:54] their mouth closed it'd be better to
[1:34:56] delete your account he'd be better to
[1:34:57] get off there altogether and say God
[1:34:59] help me Lord God and the church said who
[1:35:11] when he was reviled reviled not again
[1:35:15] when he suffered he threatened not but
[1:35:22] this is the part he committed himself to
[1:35:26] him that judgeth righteously he could
[1:35:31] have many times there's a lot of things
[1:35:33] he could have said rot out each time you
[1:35:38] know and I know there's been tempted
[1:35:40] times that you're tempted to refute
[1:35:42] something and the Spirit of God will
[1:35:43] pull you back and say let it go but god
[1:35:50] I've got more I've got the right points
[1:35:52] my points are just rotting that's it let
[1:35:54] it go you realize that that's a
[1:35:56] suffering Lord I want your word to spin
[1:36:00] God says baloney looks like let it go
[1:36:08] what should I do
[1:36:10] committed unto Him who judges
[1:36:12] righteously
[1:36:15] say Lord let that all be dissolved in my
[1:36:19] heart I commit myself to you I accept
[1:36:21] that I accept that Lord cuz I don't want
[1:36:25] them I don't want to argue about
[1:36:26] anything sin right it's like the
[1:36:30] preaching of the word we're not here to
[1:36:31] preach the word to argue lord have mercy
[1:36:33] what kind of church would it be First
[1:36:36] Church of the arguments boy you all
[1:36:42] would be full of zeal you've been going
[1:36:44] home and houses would be argument one
[1:36:45] another kids would be arguing with one
[1:36:47] another come on somebody but it's not
[1:36:50] about arguing it's about the word coming
[1:36:52] you can correct us the word cannon
[1:36:54] Mohnish us the word moves in our life
[1:36:56] but to think of the Lord Jesus himself
[1:36:58] he learned obedience he learned what it
[1:37:02] was to submit himself in the midst of
[1:37:05] tests and trials commit himself to him
[1:37:07] who judges righteously who his own self
[1:37:11] bare our sins in his own body on the
[1:37:13] tree that we being dead to sins should
[1:37:15] live unto righteousness by His stripes
[1:37:17] you were healed in plain language the
[1:37:21] Prophet says the very character of Jesus
[1:37:23] was perfected by suffering he has left
[1:37:26] his church a measure of suffering that
[1:37:29] they - by their faith in God while
[1:37:31] suffering for him would come to a place
[1:37:34] of perfection and this is what James
[1:37:37] speaks of here let me let me just
[1:37:39] descend here my brother and count it all
[1:37:43] joy when you fall into divers
[1:37:46] temptations it's not that the temptation
[1:37:52] is joyous
[1:37:52] that's not what James are saying oh god
[1:37:57] I thank you for the sick no no no that
[1:37:59] that's not what we're talking about but
[1:38:02] to recognize when something has come and
[1:38:05] you have no explanation about it you can
[1:38:09] look back and say Lord I don't know and
[1:38:11] you begin to search your life Lourdes or
[1:38:13] something listen friends when you really
[1:38:16] search your life and your heart is open
[1:38:18] before God remember I've always told you
[1:38:20] this over the years
[1:38:21] God don't hold things back from
[1:38:23] god don't say guess guess that's not
[1:38:26] God's Way if there is something God will
[1:38:30] make it known to you if it's something
[1:38:32] that needs to be corrected or made right
[1:38:34] God will never leave you in limbo he
[1:38:37] doesn't want you to walk in confusion he
[1:38:40] doesn't want you to walk in fear and
[1:38:42] wondering that's why he would come to
[1:38:45] you and make himself known to you think
[1:38:50] of this counted all joy when you fall
[1:38:52] into divers temptations knowing this
[1:38:54] that the trying of your faith worketh
[1:38:57] patience its endurance think of in your
[1:39:01] life right now there's things that when
[1:39:04] you first started serving the Lord that
[1:39:07] you look at things as you did then is
[1:39:10] that wow this is incredible
[1:39:13] now you look back on those things you
[1:39:15] think there was nothing there was
[1:39:18] nothing compared to what I'm dealing
[1:39:20] with right now but you know that along
[1:39:24] with every other test and trial prepared
[1:39:27] you and this moment prepares you for the
[1:39:32] next moment he's the author with a
[1:39:35] purpose in mind and this is what James
[1:39:39] says let patience see this son God won't
[1:39:41] do but we must let patience have a
[1:39:45] perfect work that you may be perfect and
[1:39:47] entire wanting nothing can I read just a
[1:39:53] few more scriptures to you brother
[1:39:56] Bentham talks about this of how that why
[1:39:59] God why does he stand by and how God
[1:40:02] would permit the suffering to take place
[1:40:05] within our life and this is where in
[1:40:08] Romans 8 if children then heirs of God
[1:40:10] and heir then heirs heirs of God joint
[1:40:13] heirs with Christ if so be that we
[1:40:14] suffer with him that we may be also
[1:40:17] glorified together for I reckon that the
[1:40:20] sufferings of this present time are not
[1:40:22] worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:40:24] that shall be revealed in us there is
[1:40:29] only one thing that we take with us and
[1:40:33] that's our carrot
[1:40:36] there's nothing else of this life but we
[1:40:40] do take our character and character as
[1:40:43] the Prophet goes on to this quote and
[1:40:45] you're familiar with this character is
[1:40:48] not a gift the holy ghost is a gift
[1:40:52] characters not a gift character is a
[1:40:55] victory
[1:40:57] it's his victory manifesting victory in
[1:41:02] us by his strenght we overcome when we
[1:41:10] don't understand that's where we trust
[1:41:15] that's where trust comes in we suffer
[1:41:18] with him he's right there I want you to
[1:41:21] think of this now think of this when God
[1:41:25] called Paul he spoke through anis there
[1:41:30] and anis went over there to him and
[1:41:32] began to speak to Paul of what God had
[1:41:34] made known to him he says you go tell
[1:41:37] him he's a chosen vessel unto me but I'm
[1:41:41] gonna show him that word show means
[1:41:43] teach him what great things he must
[1:41:47] suffer for my name's sake now I want you
[1:41:51] to think of this there in Jerusalem
[1:41:53] there was suffering that was going on
[1:41:56] there were things that were taking place
[1:41:58] but now God would take his messenger
[1:42:01] that would be one that would be the
[1:42:04] light that would take this gospel to the
[1:42:06] Gentiles and God would not only preach
[1:42:09] the real true gospel that delivering
[1:42:11] gospel to the Gentiles but God would
[1:42:14] have a man that would be able in his
[1:42:16] hand that God would reflect suffering
[1:42:20] God would reflect deliverance through
[1:42:24] Paul's life he could have just told him
[1:42:29] about it but he allowed it to be
[1:42:31] demonstrated and shown character we
[1:42:35] can't buy it
[1:42:36] you can't buy it
[1:42:39] the system of this of this life listen
[1:42:42] this is this comes down to where even in
[1:42:44] the little small space of time that we
[1:42:46] have with our children it's a small
[1:42:48] space of time for character development
[1:42:50] and is there everything that's fully
[1:42:52] developed within the 18 years
[1:42:54] no there's experiences that they will
[1:42:56] have to go through but the foundation
[1:42:59] and these things that are necessary that
[1:43:01] are laid in make ready for those things
[1:43:04] that are its character that's being
[1:43:08] developed because as he seated there in
[1:43:12] his father's from and we are to share
[1:43:15] that throne we cannot share that throne
[1:43:17] and reign with him unless we also suffer
[1:43:20] with him Paul's talking about a union
[1:43:23] Paul's talking about a marriage Paul's
[1:43:26] talking about these this suffering that
[1:43:29] that a person would go through this is
[1:43:31] where that Paul would talk about look
[1:43:34] not only that I would know him in the
[1:43:35] power of his resurrection that's
[1:43:40] essential as Paul said also in the
[1:43:45] Fellowship of his suffering and let me
[1:43:48] show you this scripture here if you look
[1:43:52] with me in 2nd Corinthians chapter 1 and
[1:43:53] I am closing here and I may know him in
[1:43:57] the power of his resurrection and the
[1:43:59] Fellowship of his sufferings being made
[1:44:01] conformable unto his death so suffering
[1:44:06] who's dying in suffering us the outer
[1:44:12] man is perishing but the inward man is
[1:44:16] being renewed but I'll say this to you
[1:44:21] in every test and in every trial you
[1:44:25] know him not just in the Fellowship of
[1:44:28] his suffering but you also know him in
[1:44:30] the power of his resurrection 2nd
[1:44:35] Corinthians chapter 1 verse 3 let me
[1:44:37] just read these blessed be God even the
[1:44:41] father of our Lord Jesus Christ the
[1:44:43] father of mercies and the God of all
[1:44:45] comfort who comforts us in all our
[1:44:49] tribulation behind a lot didn't he
[1:44:52] then we may be able to comfort them
[1:44:55] which are in any trouble experience is
[1:45:07] something that cannot be bought
[1:45:11] experience cannot be taught there's many
[1:45:15] things that I come to that my dad over
[1:45:18] the years even when I've just when I was
[1:45:20] just starting of things even just the
[1:45:22] pastor and my dad within the past my dad
[1:45:25] was never one let me teach you this is
[1:45:26] my dad was never like that my dad you
[1:45:28] came and he just submitted himself and
[1:45:30] moved right under that my dad was not
[1:45:32] one who walked around and went after the
[1:45:34] church was turned over here where he
[1:45:35] walked around as a I headed over and do
[1:45:37] this and don't do that that was not my
[1:45:39] dad
[1:45:40] that was not him at all I look at that
[1:45:43] right there I think My Lord Jesus he he
[1:45:46] could could he have done it he could
[1:45:48] have but he did not do that but instead
[1:45:53] when there are things that right at the
[1:45:54] very beginning of different things that
[1:45:56] he could tell me and you know what I
[1:45:58] could say I see that okay but I really
[1:46:01] didn't see it but you know what after
[1:46:04] years go by then you experience it you
[1:46:08] know what comes back to my mind what he
[1:46:10] said and when I realized that was
[1:46:12] experience it wasn't that it didn't do
[1:46:14] any good for him to tell me certain
[1:46:16] things it's just that now what he told
[1:46:18] me I realized as I go through certain
[1:46:20] things oh this is what he was talking
[1:46:22] about oh this is what he was saying no
[1:46:27] saying of the jig's did you go through
[1:46:29] that experience and get a master's
[1:46:31] degree
[1:46:31] no as a matter of fact I didn't get a
[1:46:33] certificate from kindergarten a lot of
[1:46:34] times didn't even past the preschool of
[1:46:37] a building the building blocks up but I
[1:46:40] was able to go through and say oh I see
[1:46:41] now Lord God gave me grace so next time
[1:46:46] yes sir
[1:46:48] who comfort us in all our tribulation
[1:46:51] that we may be able to comfort them
[1:46:54] which are in any trouble by the comfort
[1:46:57] wherewith we ourselves are comforted
[1:47:01] God for as the sufferings of Christ
[1:47:05] abound in us so our consolation also
[1:47:09] aboundeth by Christ
[1:47:13] well said our sufferings are just it's
[1:47:16] such great increase but so is the
[1:47:18] comfort of God so this is a testimony
[1:47:23] and whether we be afflicted it is for
[1:47:26] your consolation watch this watch this
[1:47:28] verse it is for your consolation and
[1:47:30] salvation which is effectual in the
[1:47:34] enduring of the same sufferings which we
[1:47:37] also suffer or whether we be comforted
[1:47:40] it is for your consolation and salvation
[1:47:47] there is it Paul laid down testimony
[1:47:50] human you get over to chapter 11 Paul
[1:47:52] lets them know all the different pearls
[1:47:53] all of this tribulation it was for to
[1:47:56] let them know for their consolation that
[1:47:58] the same God that brought them through
[1:48:03] and brought them out they could witness
[1:48:05] man they went through this but they
[1:48:07] could witness God brought him out not
[1:48:10] allowed that to be with the Hebrew
[1:48:11] children those things to be written for
[1:48:14] our encouragement they went through that
[1:48:16] they stood not knowing whether God would
[1:48:19] deliver not knowing what door even open
[1:48:21] but look how God brought him out
[1:48:22] look how God manifested himself to them
[1:48:25] that's written for us for us that
[1:48:30] portion in the word that God would let
[1:48:32] it be known that they came out of the
[1:48:34] fire without a smell of smoke on their
[1:48:37] clothing God let that be known for you
[1:48:40] and I that though you would go through
[1:48:42] the test and the trial yet I will
[1:48:46] preserve you and our hope of you is
[1:48:54] steadfast knowing that as ye are
[1:48:57] partakers of the suffering so shall you
[1:48:59] be also of the consolation for we would
[1:49:02] not brethren have you ignorant of our
[1:49:03] trouble which came to us in Asia that we
[1:49:06] were pressed out of measure above
[1:49:08] strength in so much that we decided
[1:49:14] even a life oh you're ruining my image
[1:49:20] Paul you're a prophet of God that didn't
[1:49:28] run it for the elected in that agent it
[1:49:30] won't run it for the elect now he
[1:49:36] despaired even his own life that means
[1:49:40] being in such a distress of straights
[1:49:42] but we had the sentence look at this but
[1:49:49] we had the sentence of death in
[1:49:51] ourselves that we should not trust in
[1:49:55] ourselves God I'll take care of this
[1:49:59] I've got the sword no Paul said that was
[1:50:04] the sentence of death the sentence of
[1:50:06] death was right in us all we had to do
[1:50:08] was give in to that sentence but what
[1:50:11] was the sentence Paul to trust in
[1:50:12] ourselves Lord you can bring me through
[1:50:17] a noise bring me through a lock David
[1:50:20] said when my heart is overwhelmed lead
[1:50:23] me to the rock lead me to the rock that
[1:50:26] is higher than I David said in Psalms I
[1:50:30] think in my distress I cried unto the
[1:50:33] Lord and he heard me and the mountains
[1:50:38] were moved look how Paul brings this
[1:50:45] when we had that sentence of death in
[1:50:47] ourselves and we should not trust in
[1:50:48] ourselves but in God which raiseth the
[1:50:52] dead why is he talking about being
[1:50:55] raised from the dead
[1:50:57] right here why why would he speak of it
[1:51:01] because going through a suffering time
[1:51:03] and Paul was speaking of the great great
[1:51:06] perplexing moment of this time it was
[1:51:08] like death but the same God that raised
[1:51:13] him up in his soul is the same God that
[1:51:16] could raise him once again watch how he
[1:51:19] reads this here but in God which raises
[1:51:22] the dead who delivered us from so great
[1:51:24] a death did he not
[1:51:27] has he not delivered you and I from so
[1:51:29] greater death and just deliver in whom
[1:51:34] we trust that he will yet deliver us
[1:51:38] this is the promise he restoreth my soul
[1:51:44] not only has my soul been raised into
[1:51:48] heavenly places but I'm so thankful that
[1:51:51] in the midst of times when we have
[1:51:53] everything that can come around us for
[1:51:55] insolence and sometimes your tests your
[1:51:56] trial and you know maybe a person could
[1:51:58] look at and say what ain't the same as
[1:52:00] mine ain't the same in mine but remember
[1:52:01] every one of this as the prophet teaches
[1:52:03] us it's laid out clearly in the
[1:52:05] scriptures that these are personal
[1:52:06] temptations these are seasons of testing
[1:52:11] and they are personal tailor-made but
[1:52:21] greater is He that is in you he that
[1:52:26] hath raised you up and delivered you
[1:52:28] from so great a death delivers you and
[1:52:30] will also deliver you in their wonderful
[1:52:34] in a wonderful amen
[1:52:37] let's stand ye also here's Paul speaking
[1:52:45] of this deliverance ye also helping
[1:52:48] together by prayer for us that for the
[1:52:53] gift bestowed upon us by the means of
[1:52:56] many persons thanks may be given by a
[1:52:59] mini on our behalf of Paul's requesting
[1:53:05] pray for us keep praying for us keep
[1:53:11] holding us up in prayer there goes God
[1:53:15] will
[1:53:18] he is faithful just one testimony
[1:53:21] tonight
[1:53:22] that was given here no doubt there's
[1:53:24] more testimonies that could be given and
[1:53:25] this situation just arose at the first
[1:53:28] part of this week is that right
[1:53:31] it just arose the first part of this
[1:53:33] week a situation that we looked at here
[1:53:36] that according to established laws
[1:53:37] according to everything else brother
[1:53:40] brother brother brother Joshua could
[1:53:41] have just said himself and just this is
[1:53:44] what the laws say this is just the way
[1:53:45] it's gonna go
[1:53:46] I'll just flow along with it but instead
[1:53:50] he requested prayer and said remember me
[1:53:55] in prayer I've got this situation but
[1:53:58] will you pray with me
[1:53:59] as far as how it looked the situation
[1:54:01] looks so bleak but yet as God not proved
[1:54:06] himself his love his care as I say that
[1:54:11] testimony is not just for our brother
[1:54:13] but that testimony is for this assembly
[1:54:15] it's for each and every one of us I'm
[1:54:19] glad God comes down and reminds us
[1:54:21] aren't you I'm glad of that because
[1:54:23] sometimes you know what we forget how
[1:54:25] God has visited us we forget the healing
[1:54:28] that has taken place not years ago just
[1:54:30] even in this past year I don't have to
[1:54:33] go and call out things back and back and
[1:54:34] back in here I'm told my just in this
[1:54:36] past year of things that God has done
[1:54:39] deliverances and things that God has
[1:54:41] brought just within this past year how
[1:54:45] how we ought to be so thankful it ought
[1:54:48] to give us encouragement and hope and
[1:54:50] let me say this to you as the song says
[1:54:53] what he's done for others with arms wide
[1:54:58] open your pardon you there is no secret
[1:55:03] what God can do don't you love him don't
[1:55:07] you just say lord I I want to just Lord
[1:55:09] more than ever I want to trust you lord
[1:55:11] help me Lord God help me Lord in
[1:55:14] everything though I can't see the end
[1:55:15] out of this but Lord God I trust you
[1:55:18] Lord to direct me and guide me through
[1:55:20] it Lord Lord Jesus let my testimony let
[1:55:24] my joy Lord let my life let even through
[1:55:26] the midst of it let it be a testimony
