[46:30] the sound of my voice Lord if they're
[46:34] out of the side of the fold right now
[46:37] may the chief Shepherd soul ring into
[46:42] their hearts this morning Lord God would
[46:46] overthrow every other voice and would
[46:50] lead that sheet safely into the fold now
[46:54] Lord will you just come minister healing
[47:01] to every every life soul spirit body
[47:08] come Lord Jesus we love you this
[47:14] have your way the name of the Lord Jesus
[47:17] was a turn with me if you would to Acts
[47:25] chapter 7 greet each and every one of
[47:32] you the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[47:38] when I read verses 2 through verse 8
[47:54] in verse two
[47:59] and he said men and brethren and fathers
[48:04] hearken the god of glory appeared unto
[48:09] our father Abraham when he was in
[48:13] Mesopotamia and before he dwelt in Iran
[48:20] he said unto him get thee out of thy
[48:25] country and from thy kindred and come
[48:29] into the land which I shall surely want
[48:35] you to catch something here the promise
[48:39] was ministered to him while he was yet
[48:43] in Mesopotamia he had not made one step
[48:50] toward the promise how could he
[48:54] he didn't know about
[48:58] so he can only make a step toward the
[49:01] promise when he became aware of the
[49:05] promise and not that there was just a
[49:08] promise but it was for him verse 3 again
[49:17] then if you could turn me down just a
[49:19] tad bit in these monitors just a tad
[49:21] sign get thee out of thy country and
[49:24] from thy kindred and come into the land
[49:30] which I shall show thee then came he out
[49:38] of the land of the Chaldeans and dwelt
[49:42] in Haran and from thence when his father
[49:47] was dead he removed him into this land
[49:51] wherein ye now dwell and he gave him
[49:56] none inheritance in it no not so much as
[49:59] to set his foot on yet he promised that
[50:05] he would give it to him for a possession
[50:07] and to his seed after him when as yet he
[50:12] had no child
[50:18] and God spake on this why's that his
[50:21] seed
[50:23] sojourn in a strange land
[50:25] and that they should bring them into
[50:28] bondage and entreat them evil for 400
[50:34] years I want you to notice this
[50:38] God has a boundary God said 400 years
[50:44] time's up
[50:48] that's the same way when God begins to
[50:51] deal with the heart and the life the
[50:53] Holy Spirit is saying times up devil
[50:57] times up times up because you see God
[51:02] comes according to his promises that
[51:06] he's made and when he takes that promise
[51:10] and begins to sound that promise it is
[51:13] like a trumpet that is being blown with
[51:16] such clarity and distinction it has a
[51:20] certain sound to it it calls it
[51:25] registers with that seed on the inside
[51:27] and they're not looking at the trumpet
[51:29] they're just hearing what's coming
[51:31] through it because they know what's
[51:34] coming through it that is the promise
[51:37] for me
[51:43] and the nation whoa look at this and the
[51:46] nation to whom they shall be in bondage
[51:49] will I judge this is what God told
[51:51] Abraham I'm gonna bring judgment to that
[51:53] nation that you're in bondage to and
[51:57] after that shall they come forth and
[52:01] serve me in this place notice after
[52:03] judgment after visiting in judgment then
[52:07] they'll come forth and serve in this
[52:10] place what he gave him and he gave him
[52:15] the Covenant of circumcision and so
[52:19] Abraham begat Isaac and circumcised him
[52:23] the eighth day and Isaac begat jacob and
[52:27] jacob begat the twelve patriarchs they
[52:32] god bless you
[52:34] being seeded bless the reading of his
[52:36] word
[52:39] I'm gonna take my time maybe operate in
[52:43] a different gear but I'm gonna begin to
[52:46] speak on the Holy Ghost
[52:54] because it's not
[53:00] the Holy Ghost is not a option it is a
[53:05] necessity the Holy Ghost is not the
[53:10] third person of the Trinity it is God
[53:15] him self his own life it's the same God
[53:24] that spake and was above in the
[53:31] wilderness in the pillar fire that same
[53:34] God came down and created a body of
[53:38] flesh in order to pay the price and
[53:45] thereby redeem us back to himself and
[53:51] deposit in us the life we were intended
[53:56] to have from the mind of God
[54:04] you see as we read here in act and act
[54:09] seven
[54:12] a person cannot receive cannot even come
[54:15] and receive the Holy Spirit unless you
[54:19] know what it is and I want you to listen
[54:23] to me closely and you cannot receive it
[54:26] unless you believe it's given to you and
[54:31] it's for you
[54:37] and you can't what know whether you've
[54:39] got it or not unless you know what
[54:41] results that it brings
[54:46] so you know what it is and who it is and
[54:49] what action it brings when it comes then
[54:51] you'll know what you've got when you got
[54:54] it and so when we look at this the first
[54:58] thing I want to just deal with this
[55:00] morning and I'm not I'm not gonna run on
[55:04] a lot of types I'm not doing that I'm
[55:06] just gonna stay right here there's times
[55:09] for that but I'm just going to stay
[55:11] right in here because I want I just I'll
[55:14] say it like this I feel reserved to him
[55:17] to to just bring it in these in these
[55:21] matters so I'm going to deal with it
[55:24] this first here's the first thing I want
[55:26] to deal with just this morning the Holy
[55:28] Spirit is a sign I said it's a sign when
[55:36] you were driving down this road right
[55:37] here it might be your first time here or
[55:42] the first time when you came here
[55:43] but you had to look for a sign and a
[55:47] sign would tell you there's a gathering
[55:50] going on here a sign puts out a
[55:54] distinction puts out a mark it is to
[55:58] make aware of something and this sign
[56:03] this sign is to a covenant people
[56:10] and I'll say it to you like this there's
[56:12] a vast difference between just a
[56:15] Christian and a Holy Ghost filled
[56:18] Christian big difference
[56:24] so you know you can have or a Christian
[56:27] a person who accepts the Lord Jesus
[56:30] Christ there as their Savior they repent
[56:36] that's the first place that that's a
[56:39] starting point you've got to start but
[56:41] the only way you can repent is first of
[56:44] all believe that there's one who already
[56:49] died for your sins
[56:56] and to believe he did it for you and if
[57:02] there wasn't no one else he'd do it for
[57:05] you listen to me your focus is on him
[57:18] it's on him you say well I'm not very
[57:22] good at that's we're not talking about
[57:23] that we're talking about him
[57:29] repentance is not based on what you
[57:31] think you're able repentance is based on
[57:34] what he has done and is available for
[57:39] you
[57:43] repentance is you're going this
[57:45] direction and you repent you're no
[57:48] longer facing and going that direction
[57:50] you're going a different way
[57:56] there's a big difference if a Christian
[57:59] you see as a Christian profess to be a
[58:02] Christian of this Christian has not been
[58:05] filled with the Holy Ghost he's only in
[58:09] process of being a Christian a glass
[58:16] that's been picked up but still dirty
[58:21] before you can before you can ever wash
[58:24] the glass you got to get it out of the
[58:26] mud first is that right there's not one
[58:30] of you if you were if there was a dirty
[58:32] dish that was laying in dirt you don't
[58:35] go to the dirt and start scrubbing it
[58:37] you you reach down and lift it there's a
[58:41] power that lifts and makes real to a
[58:44] person one has already bore your sin
[58:50] away
[58:55] sometimes that's mistaken for the
[58:58] filling of the Holy Ghost when they feel
[59:00] the burden lifted but the feeling of the
[59:03] Holy Ghost is where he comes to dwell
[59:05] what you're experiencing what a person
[59:08] experiences is what he's already done
[59:16] he's professed a professed Christian yet
[59:19] not field he's professed to believe it
[59:21] he's working listen to me now he's
[59:23] working to it and they just say to you
[59:27] like this and you sir probably come more
[59:30] clear in the message God does not come
[59:33] and fill anybody who's just sitting with
[59:35] their feet propped up and saying well
[59:38] he's gonna give it to me he's gonna give
[59:41] it to me God don't give the Holy Ghost
[59:44] like that the Holy Ghost is given to
[59:48] those who believe him and they make
[59:53] themselves available to receive why
[59:59] because they think they can be good
[1:00:01] enough no because they believe him are
[1:00:10] you with me
[1:00:13] we don't believe because oh this seems
[1:00:15] reasonable this seems possible that's
[1:00:18] not faith faith says I believe it
[1:00:23] because God said it
[1:00:34] glory be to God
[1:00:37] he's working to it but God has not given
[1:00:40] him the spirit of the Holy Ghost he has
[1:00:42] not reached the goal with God that he's
[1:00:45] recognized God made a covenant of
[1:00:48] promise to Abraham if you need to pinch
[1:00:51] yourself through you I don't want you to
[1:00:53] go to sleep but you will be able to come
[1:00:56] back to this message God made a covenant
[1:00:59] of promise to Abraham and that covenant
[1:01:03] that the Lord made to Abraham was I have
[1:01:09] already
[1:01:11] I will notice i I I will do this not we
[1:01:21] I Abraham had to believe the Covenant
[1:01:29] promise that the Lord had made to him
[1:01:34] worthiness
[1:01:38] worthiness
[1:01:42] Abraham was dwelling in Mesopotamia
[1:01:46] making idols making gods
[1:01:55] worthinesse he had all sorts of thing
[1:02:01] upon his life all sorts of sin and
[1:02:04] condemnation let me just say this to you
[1:02:11] the devil will try to take a life
[1:02:19] and he will try to somar that life to
[1:02:25] where that they in themselves instead of
[1:02:30] when the trumpet sounding instead of
[1:02:32] looking at that trumpet listening to God
[1:02:35] who is speaking they look at themselves
[1:02:39] let me just say this to you that's a
[1:02:43] trick of the enemy who has been the one
[1:02:47] to influence you to make decisions that
[1:02:50] you've made in the past but there's a
[1:02:54] living God present to let you know I can
[1:02:59] remove I will remove the condemnation
[1:03:02] that you can go free worthy no sir
[1:03:09] worthy that he would speak to me I don't
[1:03:12] care if you had not done one thing we
[1:03:17] are born in sin shaped and iniquity and
[1:03:20] come to the world speak in live in John
[1:03:24] chapter 3 Nicodemus stood there before
[1:03:27] the Lord Jesus
[1:03:29] Lord Jesus ministering one of the very
[1:03:32] first doctrines and the principle of all
[1:03:34] the scriptures you must be born again
[1:03:36] because without the new birth you're not
[1:03:39] even in the Covenant a man who you could
[1:03:47] not put a finger on his life
[1:03:51] the Pharisees here's the Lord Jesus the
[1:03:56] Lord Jesus speaks to the Pharisees
[1:03:59] religious people and he called them
[1:04:05] righteous
[1:04:09] is this the word
[1:04:12] but when he could look beyond all of
[1:04:15] their righteous acts out here and looked
[1:04:17] down on the inside
[1:04:19] he said you're full of dead men's bones
[1:04:23] every messenger that God has sent to you
[1:04:26] crucified you cut him off when if what
[1:04:29] was what was every one of those prophets
[1:04:32] the Bible says in Hebrews one verse one
[1:04:35] through verse four that the Holy Ghost
[1:04:38] spake to the father's in the prophets in
[1:04:43] your Bible it says by the prophets what
[1:04:45] was he doing he was announcing and
[1:04:49] declaring the promise
[1:04:53] of his word I don't get tired of hearing
[1:04:59] it
[1:05:06] he called Abraham and Abraham listen
[1:05:10] Abraham heard the call and noticed what
[1:05:13] we read the result is Abraham moved out
[1:05:17] of the country and went into a strange
[1:05:21] land me to say this
[1:05:23] he had a citizenship in Mesopotamia but
[1:05:28] God was calling him to another land God
[1:05:34] was calling him to a land he did not
[1:05:36] know that Abraham it is inscribed a
[1:05:39] citizenship here but you need to come
[1:05:42] here that I can Minister this
[1:05:44] citizenship to you not a back and forth
[1:05:50] but this is a one-way one-way ticket
[1:05:56] burning every bridge behind you
[1:06:02] Amen it's a type of how God calls a man
[1:06:06] listen God calls the man to stop all his
[1:06:10] meanness
[1:06:11] repent of his sin he turns then from the
[1:06:15] crowd that he was in I said he turns
[1:06:19] from the crowd that he was in and I say
[1:06:25] this to you
[1:06:26] respectively but pointedly if you're
[1:06:29] still dwelling in the crowd that you're
[1:06:30] in and you still enjoyed that company
[1:06:33] then you do not have the Holy Ghost it
[1:06:38] calls you out of and into another
[1:06:42] company you understand what I'm saying
[1:06:44] it isn't that you can't eat lunch with
[1:06:46] them but if you join in and you're a
[1:06:49] part of that you feed of that same stuff
[1:06:52] you do not have the Holy Ghost
[1:07:00] he turns din from the crowd that he was
[1:07:03] in to live in a new crowd I want you to
[1:07:09] understand me these things that are
[1:07:12] ministering right now and has it just
[1:07:13] coming to me is not set to condemn you
[1:07:16] it's to convict you
[1:07:22] you can live in a new crowd among new
[1:07:25] types of people I want you to look at
[1:07:28] this after God found Abraham to be
[1:07:32] faithful to the promise how was Abraham
[1:07:36] being faithful to the promise
[1:07:39] God God declared the promise when
[1:07:43] Abraham was still down there
[1:07:45] honing out other gods how did he find
[1:07:51] Abraham to be faithful
[1:07:53] when Abraham said Sarah sorry I let's
[1:08:00] get packed up where are we going you
[1:08:05] remember that old uncle I had her
[1:08:10] great-great-great great-grandfather Noah
[1:08:12] you know the same God that spoke to him
[1:08:17] just spoke to me well what brought that
[1:08:23] about is something within me begin to
[1:08:27] hunger and thirst I heard how God moved
[1:08:32] in Noah's life and I just said God if
[1:08:36] you're still real but you speak to me
[1:08:42] and God came and spoke to him I'm
[1:08:48] quoting you don't know that I'm quoting
[1:08:50] he spoke to him and Abraham began to
[1:08:54] pack think listen to me listen to me
[1:08:56] he's being faithful to the promise when
[1:08:59] he started to pack things up he's still
[1:09:01] in Mesopotamia but his heart was already
[1:09:05] it was already from here you begin to
[1:09:08] turn sometimes the turning of the heart
[1:09:10] it's things we don't always see right
[1:09:13] away but God comes to turn the heart
[1:09:20] he's first gonna turn the heart hot to
[1:09:23] be leave then Abraham he begins to pack
[1:09:28] up the journey from Mesopotamia and they
[1:09:31] come to her on at the end of Genesis 11
[1:09:35] you know where I'm at in the Bible he
[1:09:37] comes to her on but God never told him
[1:09:40] to stop in her on God never told him to
[1:09:45] do that
[1:09:48] god never told you to stop and just come
[1:09:51] to a message Church God never told you
[1:09:56] just to stop there
[1:09:58] well I believe he never told you to stop
[1:10:02] there he turned his hair on his father's
[1:10:09] with him this is the Bible lot is with
[1:10:12] him
[1:10:12] God did not go through a list and say
[1:10:16] get rid of this one get rid of that one
[1:10:18] don't be around this one don't be around
[1:10:19] he didn't say that
[1:10:20] his word held within it the declaration
[1:10:25] for the moment woman's God saying don't
[1:10:29] reason with my word and say I could keep
[1:10:32] this I can keep this I don't need this I
[1:10:35] can get rid of this well you know
[1:10:37] so-and-so does this in church and in my
[1:10:39] bill Kate do never make somebody else
[1:10:41] your standard there is one standard
[1:10:47] among us and that is the Holy Ghost the
[1:10:51] word if you do that you'll reason
[1:10:57] yourself right into hell the scripture
[1:11:05] says those who will move in that way
[1:11:09] forsake their own mercies
[1:11:17] he's in her own
[1:11:21] what's with him his daddy's with him god
[1:11:26] never told him to stop on her own God
[1:11:27] said get the out into a land that I'll
[1:11:29] show you where's this land that Abraham
[1:11:36] didn't ask that question the God who
[1:11:39] told him to separate
[1:11:41] he said I'll show you a land Abraham had
[1:11:46] to have faith not explanations he had to
[1:11:51] believe that same voice that spoke to me
[1:11:53] and said come out is the same voice that
[1:11:57] will direct me to where he wants me to
[1:12:00] be and show me what he wants to show me
[1:12:08] calls him out separate from this
[1:12:12] separate from that said you see let me
[1:12:14] just say this to you if you're looking
[1:12:16] at everything well I don't want to quit
[1:12:17] doing this and I'm not gonna stop doing
[1:12:18] that and I'm not gonna stop doing this
[1:12:20] for brother Samuel and I'm gonna go I'm
[1:12:22] not asking you to do nothing for me I've
[1:12:25] come to minister on his behalf
[1:12:29] I'm not here representing me I'm
[1:12:31] representing the gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:12:35] I'm not I'm not trying to put my image
[1:12:38] in your heart amen i'm not a vessel of
[1:12:44] dishonor i'm a vessel of Honor I want
[1:12:48] you to be united with that image of
[1:12:50] Christ and that image of Christ to be
[1:12:53] reflected in you to where when you walk
[1:12:55] down the street no matter where you go
[1:12:57] there's the presence of the Living God
[1:12:59] that is with you that denotes itself
[1:13:02] that you are a Christian you're not a
[1:13:05] Christian by title you're a Christian
[1:13:07] because Christ is in you
[1:13:19] get out of the land you see many times
[1:13:22] people are always looking at the wrong
[1:13:25] thing when you look at what you gotta
[1:13:29] give up that's the tactic of the enemy
[1:13:33] can't you see it's that old nature
[1:13:35] that's under condemnation but it's to
[1:13:39] look at who is calling you he who calls
[1:13:46] you is faithful to perform but if your
[1:13:53] love is to all of those other things and
[1:13:58] you're not willing to say love of God
[1:14:03] separate me I turn my back on that why
[1:14:10] you turn your back on it because he's
[1:14:13] calling me there's something greater
[1:14:17] than every desire that I have every
[1:14:20] dream there's something that's greater I
[1:14:22] can't explain it
[1:14:26] then you're being like Ruth Ruth left
[1:14:32] all of her country come on friends these
[1:14:36] aren't just Bible stories these were
[1:14:38] spoken in the Word of God as a direct
[1:14:40] prophecy of the children of God when
[1:14:45] orful walked up to Naomi and kissed her
[1:14:49] on the cheek and then she turned around
[1:14:51] and went right back Ruth said I'm not
[1:14:56] going anywhere where you go I'm going
[1:15:03] where you lunch I'm gonna launch and
[1:15:07] your God is gonna be my god
[1:15:13] Ruth's color vision something rules in
[1:15:18] her heart that said I'm not going back
[1:15:20] into the land of Moab Moab was under a
[1:15:23] curse and God's mercy spared it from
[1:15:26] being wiped out in the Book of Numbers
[1:15:27] why because there was a roof down there
[1:15:32] and the judgment of God would have
[1:15:35] already broke fully upon this earth but
[1:15:37] what is it there's a Ruth and Naomi
[1:15:46] Alleluia after God found Abraham to be
[1:15:54] faithful to the promise that he gave him
[1:15:57] that he would give him a child and
[1:15:59] through this child all the earth would
[1:16:01] be blessed you weren't talking about
[1:16:03] Isaac Isaac was the type but it was
[1:16:07] talking about the faith child the sea
[1:16:10] child Jesus Christ because it's through
[1:16:15] that child that then can come the
[1:16:18] blessing upon all the families of the
[1:16:20] earth were blessing are we talking about
[1:16:23] the Holy Ghost God's own life well what
[1:16:33] a loving father he would pour his life
[1:16:37] out for his children
[1:16:41] then God confirmed his faith by giving
[1:16:45] him a sign and that sign was
[1:16:46] circumcision and circumcision itself is
[1:16:50] a type of the Holy Spirit
[1:16:52] remember I'm speaking to you this
[1:16:53] morning that the Holy Ghost is a sign in
[1:16:57] genesis 17:7 I'm Melana laying this
[1:17:00] right into the scriptures I'm not
[1:17:02] skipping it I'm not trying to preach it
[1:17:04] and move along I'm doing everything I
[1:17:06] can to stay right here but I am faithful
[1:17:09] to the burden he's put on my heart in
[1:17:13] verse 7 and I will establish my covenant
[1:17:19] between me and thee and thy seed after
[1:17:22] thee I want you to notice this God
[1:17:24] already made the
[1:17:26] is that right he already announced the
[1:17:29] promise and the covenant but God says I
[1:17:32] want to establish it I want to drive it
[1:17:39] right down my covenant between me and
[1:17:42] thee and thy seed after thee in their
[1:17:44] generations for an everlasting covenant
[1:17:49] in that wonderful to be a God unto thee
[1:17:53] and to thy seed after thee
[1:17:56] he's just as much God today as he ever
[1:18:01] was and a child of God calls out from
[1:18:07] the heart awakens a low strength of the
[1:18:11] Lord awakened or arm of the Lord that
[1:18:14] same God who moved down and part of the
[1:18:18] Red Sea who opened the Jordan await thy
[1:18:20] old strength of the Lord glory be to God
[1:18:30] to be a God unto thee and to thy seed
[1:18:34] after thee verse a and I will give unto
[1:18:38] thee and to the seed after thee the land
[1:18:42] were in thou art a stranger all the land
[1:18:46] of canaan for an everlasting possession
[1:18:48] and I will be their God
[1:18:51] God said unto Abraham thou shalt keep my
[1:18:55] covenant beat therefore thou and thy
[1:18:57] seed after thee in their generations
[1:19:01] you see what God is telling to Abraham
[1:19:05] I want you to show the same kind of
[1:19:07] diligence towards this covenant that I
[1:19:12] have displayed to you I have made my
[1:19:18] word real before you and he could ask
[1:19:22] the question are you sufficiently
[1:19:24] impressed with a word in your midst then
[1:19:29] give the same carefulness the same
[1:19:31] diligence
[1:19:34] people will look over the silverware
[1:19:36] more carefully at a restaurant for spots
[1:19:40] of filth than they will examine their
[1:19:43] own soul and they wouldn't stick
[1:19:48] anything like sticking that in its got a
[1:19:50] piece of dried egg and yet everything
[1:19:53] else all around all other forms of trash
[1:19:57] all other forms of things that come in
[1:20:00] to defile remember defiles
[1:20:04] God wants his people separated we're not
[1:20:11] separated by odd ideas because I do not
[1:20:14] call the Word of God an odd idea but
[1:20:19] I'll tell you what's odd to a believer
[1:20:21] is the traditions of man that makes the
[1:20:25] Word of God of no effect where it's
[1:20:32] rendered powerless God has not lost
[1:20:36] power as a matter of fact jesus said
[1:20:41] after his resurrection when he appeared
[1:20:44] to the disciples he didn't lose power he
[1:20:48] gained power he said all power in heaven
[1:20:51] and earth is given into my hands
[1:21:03] show that same diligence here it
[1:21:06] recognized it to be God and act upon it
[1:21:09] act upon it this is my covenant verse 10
[1:21:15] which he shall keep between me and you
[1:21:18] and thy seed after thee every man child
[1:21:20] among you shall be circumcised and you
[1:21:26] shall circumcise the flesh of your
[1:21:30] foreskin and it shall be a token of the
[1:21:35] Covenant betwixt me and you notice cut
[1:21:41] away the surplus flesh it would be an
[1:21:47] evident sign and still note it'll be a
[1:21:49] token
[1:21:55] God said I want to give you a token and
[1:22:00] assurance that when the devil tries to
[1:22:04] bring his Bluffs you've got a token
[1:22:12] I want to give you something he might
[1:22:14] punch at it
[1:22:16] but it's a seal to you it's an assurance
[1:22:21] in here that you know that you know that
[1:22:26] you know that you know
[1:22:35] who gets it the past forget no no God
[1:22:38] said I do it
[1:22:41] what said I don't want you I don't want
[1:22:44] any other man's circumcising my children
[1:22:46] I circumcised them I've already made a
[1:22:50] decision before the foundation of the
[1:22:52] world they're going to be circumcised
[1:22:55] and I make preparation that in their
[1:22:58] generation they can also receive the
[1:23:02] same circumcision of the Holy Ghost
[1:23:10] what's going to stop him
[1:23:13] are you with me that's it what's gonna
[1:23:16] stop him nothing
[1:23:25] no matter what unbelief seems to be
[1:23:27] present it can not stop or hinder God
[1:23:31] from fulfilling his word when God is
[1:23:36] present brother he comes packing ready
[1:23:39] to deal with unbelief he may not be
[1:23:44] packing heat but he's packing the blood
[1:23:48] hallelujah he comes ready to deal with
[1:23:52] that intruder in your life because that
[1:23:58] intruder jumped in
[1:24:00] he cometh a thief and a robber seeketh
[1:24:03] to destroy to kill but he said I am come
[1:24:09] that you might have life and have it
[1:24:14] more abundantly beyond what you can
[1:24:17] imagine and he that is eight days old
[1:24:34] shall be circumcised among you eight
[1:24:40] speaks of a new beginning the
[1:24:45] circumcision is an eighth day
[1:24:47] circumcision are you with me amen and
[1:24:52] eight speaks of a new beginning
[1:24:56] because after the seventh is the eighth
[1:24:58] but you go back to the beginning again
[1:25:01] we're still in time in the seventh
[1:25:05] but the circumcision of the Holy Ghost
[1:25:08] we receive the reality of the eighth day
[1:25:12] in our soul as sons and daughters of
[1:25:16] Almighty God I'm trying not to run there
[1:25:23] what is that that's the spirit of that
[1:25:26] other land let me ask you something how
[1:25:30] do you know somebody's from a different
[1:25:31] nationality it's because of how they
[1:25:34] look okay I'll give that to you that's
[1:25:36] also how they look is a sign how they
[1:25:40] dress is a sign they'll dress according
[1:25:44] to the I'll say guard guard not meaning
[1:25:46] anything derogatory but they will dress
[1:25:48] according to the garb or that of their
[1:25:52] homeland you with me that's why our
[1:25:56] women don't wear pants not because it's
[1:26:01] a rule because God said so in his word
[1:26:05] that's why our men don't act like and
[1:26:07] look like sissies when super tight
[1:26:12] matches come on somebody it's nothing
[1:26:17] but a perverted spirit out of the pizza
[1:26:19] hell
[1:26:22] that's why women don't cut their hair
[1:26:25] why they recognize I'm a daughter of the
[1:26:28] king and my conduct reflects the king so
[1:26:34] if you're doing that you might want to
[1:26:36] bring an exile let the King of glory
[1:26:39] bring an ex out to the king that's
[1:26:42] ruling your life
[1:26:48] that's why that's why we don't do
[1:26:51] certain things why because the king and
[1:26:54] the kingdom we are of you with me this
[1:27:02] is Scripture you understand that I know
[1:27:04] I've got people here the first time
[1:27:06] maybe being here I'm talking Bible to
[1:27:08] you the Bible said that you did that
[1:27:13] that a woman is to be adorned in modest
[1:27:16] apparel and modest means free-flowing
[1:27:20] you might have a dress on but it might
[1:27:22] be skin tight like a wiener that is not
[1:27:26] the Word of God your body let me ask you
[1:27:29] something your body is to be reserved
[1:27:32] for your husband or if you're in process
[1:27:36] or even in that place saying I don't
[1:27:38] need but God I'm looking for one day
[1:27:40] your body is to be like the gold that's
[1:27:44] behind the vault in a bank you go into a
[1:27:49] bank you're with me I can't see it I got
[1:27:52] my glasses on but when you go into a
[1:27:56] bank you don't go in there and say
[1:28:00] I want alone show me the gold see how
[1:28:06] far that gets you
[1:28:07] they keep what's precious to them under
[1:28:10] lock and key nobody is going to see that
[1:28:18] that's right that's why the Bible tells
[1:28:21] us it ought to be free-flowing it might
[1:28:25] be up here and all loose but it's to
[1:28:28] cover because God said this is his word
[1:28:31] above that of the knee and not coming
[1:28:33] down his nakedness that's his word y'all
[1:28:39] with me I'm preaching the Holy Ghost
[1:28:41] this morning that's his word his word
[1:28:47] opposed you to let go a hot heels
[1:28:55] that's your idea I'm talking Bible to
[1:28:58] you this morning I'm talking to you out
[1:29:00] of the book of Isaiah and the Book of
[1:29:02] Jeremiah
[1:29:06] cut hair is regarded to God as rebellion
[1:29:10] buckle Jeremiah and that's why Paul
[1:29:13] would pick it up in first Kirk first
[1:29:15] Corinthians 7 and 11 and deal with it
[1:29:19] and he won't talking about putting a hat
[1:29:21] on your head
[1:29:22] but that covering is power on your head
[1:29:26] if sir recognize members you too have
[1:29:29] power on their head because of the
[1:29:30] angels angels lowercase not wings on
[1:29:32] their back lower case one of the lower
[1:29:34] case angels messengers earthly human
[1:29:37] messengers endowed with the Holy Ghost
[1:29:40] to call those people out that have power
[1:29:45] on their head - shell I'm under
[1:29:46] authority of the word not of a church
[1:29:51] because the church came back you up
[1:29:54] unless it's the one over there that said
[1:29:56] if own seven hills called Rome come on
[1:30:00] which is the of the whole earth
[1:30:03] come on somebody I'm talking to your
[1:30:06] Bible this morning I always talk to you
[1:30:09] by God I'm not preaching man's ideas I
[1:30:12] preach it to you the Word of God that's
[1:30:17] why the scripture said come out of her
[1:30:19] my people it causes the faith paint to
[1:30:28] be gone that's only a covering that's
[1:30:32] only trying to pretend to be something
[1:30:33] that you're not and if you're a husband
[1:30:38] and whatever more if he likes your paint
[1:30:39] he needs a good baptism of the Holy
[1:30:42] Ghost
[1:30:47] that ain't legalism that's thus saith
[1:30:50] the Lord
[1:30:51] [Applause]
[1:30:53] this is the Word of God after you found
[1:31:00] faithful he that are safe or in the
[1:31:04] least of these things I will make ruler
[1:31:08] over many God doesn't make person ruler
[1:31:12] if they're not faithful in one didn't
[1:31:14] think like a person can't even be
[1:31:17] faithful to come to the house of God who
[1:31:21] can him be faithful to pay their ties
[1:31:25] can't even be faithful in offering God
[1:31:28] didn't just say you are me around me and
[1:31:29] times he said you robbed me and tithes
[1:31:31] and offerings if we have been not
[1:31:37] faithful in the small things how can God
[1:31:39] release
[1:31:42] that great riches and I ain't talking
[1:31:44] about BMWs and houses and lands he give
[1:31:48] it to you if he wants you to have that
[1:31:50] but that's not why we serve him we serve
[1:31:55] him because of him
[1:31:58] not because of what he can't do for me
[1:32:00] but because of what he already did verse
[1:32:06] 13 and he that is born in the house and
[1:32:09] he that is bought with my money must
[1:32:12] needs be circumcised and my covenant
[1:32:15] shall be in your flesh for an
[1:32:17] everlasting covenant your gods are
[1:32:19] saying it's gonna be a sign it will not
[1:32:23] be any guessing it'll be a sign in your
[1:32:28] flesh you with me well I believe God
[1:32:33] I've got the Holy Ghost
[1:32:37] is this thing in subjection or not if
[1:32:40] it's not in subjection
[1:32:43] then you lack sufficient power that he
[1:32:46] promised you never make this perfect but
[1:32:52] mistakes are mistakes not excuses for
[1:32:56] lawful or for willful behaviors I just
[1:33:05] made a mistake you know really that's a
[1:33:09] careless attitude and you've got the
[1:33:13] greatest treasure indeed not just the
[1:33:16] earth but the greatest treasure how do
[1:33:20] we treat that treasure
[1:33:29] verse 14 and the uncircumcised man child
[1:33:33] whose flesh of his foreskin is not
[1:33:37] circumcised that soul notice where he's
[1:33:41] going to
[1:33:43] that soul shall be cut off from his
[1:33:49] people he hath broken my covenant how
[1:33:54] did he break it because he didn't heed
[1:33:57] to the word he knew he ought to eat too
[1:34:01] ignorance is one thing but once you've
[1:34:05] known and you failed to act upon it then
[1:34:07] it's no longer ignorance amen
[1:34:12] so you see circumcision it isn't an
[1:34:15] option it is a must in order to be in
[1:34:19] the Covenant notice that soul will be
[1:34:21] cut off they were in the Covenant it
[1:34:24] would be a sign in the flesh that would
[1:34:27] be a witness that they were Abraham see
[1:34:29] can't you see God's desire was so that
[1:34:32] Abraham's seed would have an evident
[1:34:35] seal that whether they felt like a seed
[1:34:39] of Abraham or not they had a seal that
[1:34:44] was the answer to the devil's question
[1:34:47] come on somebody it would be an answer
[1:34:52] right there to the devil's question it
[1:34:54] would be like that word Tamar had that
[1:34:56] seal she said this this right here this
[1:35:01] is the man that I've been with here the
[1:35:03] one who sealed this is that's whose seed
[1:35:06] is in my womb the seal says this wound
[1:35:13] belongs to Jesus oh ma you see that seal
[1:35:22] when pressure would come around
[1:35:25] circumstances arise there'd be a man in
[1:35:29] the Bible in the book of Judges with one
[1:35:32] two little verses of Scripture two two
[1:35:35] little verses of Scripture but they
[1:35:37] don't take a lot of people to be a
[1:35:39] mighty man it only takes two you and God
[1:35:44] that's the majority with two vices
[1:35:47] Shamgar
[1:35:48] began to recognize all the encroachment
[1:35:51] of the enemy have been coming against
[1:35:53] him they were taking the crop every time
[1:35:55] that the crop would come near
[1:35:56] harvest here would the enemy show up
[1:35:58] again about ready when they were to
[1:36:00] harvest in the seed into their dwelling
[1:36:03] the enemy would show up this time
[1:36:08] Shamgar was not focused on the previous
[1:36:11] defeats I tried I failed I trying to
[1:36:16] fail the focus was not upon him the
[1:36:19] focus was
[1:36:23] God made a covenant with Abraham surely
[1:36:29] and I'm a seed of Abraham I've got the
[1:36:33] seal I've got the sign I've got the
[1:36:37] token come on I got the badge of
[1:36:40] believer I don't have to settle for the
[1:36:45] enemy's encroachment so sangar remember
[1:36:51] he solved in the ox gold
[1:36:54] what is an ox code it's used to prod the
[1:36:57] Ox what is ox it's a beast of burden
[1:37:00] you've got something to do
[1:37:05] sangar took that ox goad up
[1:37:09] I don't remember the exact number
[1:37:14] but let me tell you something it was
[1:37:15] more than three to one
[1:37:18] thousands but he didn't look at the odds
[1:37:22] that was against him he looked at who
[1:37:25] watch for him and I tell you that's what
[1:37:30] the Holy Ghost is if God is for you and
[1:37:35] if God be for us who can be against us
[1:37:47] the sin I walked in here a sinner today
[1:37:49] you tell me God is God is with me yes
[1:37:53] but he wants to be in you Stephen goes
[1:38:02] on in acts 7 verse 51 and he's talking
[1:38:08] to remember these audience he's talking
[1:38:10] to he's talking to religious people
[1:38:15] these were guys that well Peter Stephen
[1:38:20] begins to speak and he says ye
[1:38:23] uncircumcised in heart in heart and ear
[1:38:29] you do always resist
[1:38:34] the Holy Ghost even as your father's did
[1:38:39] you say the Holy Ghost
[1:38:41] he's faked through Jeremiah he's fake
[1:38:47] through Isaiah and they hacked him to
[1:38:48] pieces not foreign entities his people
[1:38:53] people that knew the covenants but they
[1:38:59] rose up in here was something different
[1:39:02] and different nature said don't tell me
[1:39:04] I have to have this don't tell me I have
[1:39:06] to do this to me a Christian don't tell
[1:39:09] me if that spirit surrounds you this
[1:39:12] morning recognize that's the devil and
[1:39:14] so Satan
[1:39:15] get behind me go ahead say get behind me
[1:39:22] devil I am here to receive what God has
[1:39:25] for me notice he said stiff net
[1:39:32] that couldn't be led they could not be
[1:39:34] turned from their ways but the Bible
[1:39:38] says there is a way the book of Proverbs
[1:39:40] that seemeth right unto a man but the
[1:39:44] end and the ways thereof are the way of
[1:39:47] death the circumcision sign it was after
[1:39:56] God after he Abraham had accepted God on
[1:39:59] his promise and he walked out into a
[1:40:01] strange country God uses that same sign
[1:40:05] of circumcision as a distinction that
[1:40:09] makes a separation listen to me it's not
[1:40:13] us making ourselves awed you're with me
[1:40:21] it's not us trying to be awed and
[1:40:24] different
[1:40:29] this is not me to say if I can get the
[1:40:34] right words here it's not a way of life
[1:40:41] or we're just gonna do things this way
[1:40:43] no it's not a way of life
[1:40:45] it is the way of the life
[1:40:57] it's a distinction it's a mark and you
[1:41:03] and I both know there have been people
[1:41:04] and there still are people I'm gonna
[1:41:09] call them religious quacks or whatever
[1:41:11] you want okay it hasn't stopped out
[1:41:15] there it come right around our ranks -
[1:41:18] we got nuts here -
[1:41:27] you know that is that's enticing spirits
[1:41:30] against the Word of God there is a path
[1:41:33] in the word to come into the
[1:41:36] righteousness of God
[1:41:38] repent be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:41:41] Christ for the remission of your sins
[1:41:43] and you shall receive the Holy Ghost
[1:41:46] that's the word pass but anything rising
[1:41:50] up against our will I felt this or I did
[1:41:52] this or I did that and it is not a heart
[1:41:54] that has a style a seal a token on the
[1:41:58] inside that I know I passed from death
[1:42:00] unto life because it's a lie
[1:42:02] that a man's and lines up with the word
[1:42:06] not just out on an experience or a
[1:42:09] sensation walk in a cool freezer you'll
[1:42:14] get a sensation there to meddigan
[1:42:17] sensations but I'm saying after the
[1:42:20] sensation and experience has left where
[1:42:23] is your life Adi in the word I'm talking
[1:42:32] about a distinction and then God Who am
[1:42:37] I
[1:42:37] when God seals you he don't unseal you
[1:42:41] and let you go back out in the world and
[1:42:43] say we'll come back you were sealed I'll
[1:42:45] seal you back here once he seals you
[1:42:47] brother if he unseals you he breaks his
[1:42:51] word
[1:42:55] once you're sealed it is God saying you
[1:43:01] are sealed unto the day of redemption
[1:43:11] it's not us making ourselves odd now I
[1:43:17] know I know I know I know I know I know
[1:43:19] I know I know
[1:43:20] we look odd
[1:43:22] you walk out in the street today you
[1:43:24] walk in the grocery store and you see it
[1:43:26] what listen I've been around here in
[1:43:28] this community I walk other places I see
[1:43:30] a woman walking around in a dress I look
[1:43:33] since she got a long hair okay she don't
[1:43:35] got your Bob's in her in her ears I get
[1:43:38] to looking around and I want to go up to
[1:43:41] him and say you're Christian aren't you
[1:43:45] you say how in the world would you even
[1:43:48] they may not be they may just be long
[1:43:50] hair just might be the style come on
[1:43:52] somebody
[1:43:53] oh yeah dresses are in style come on
[1:43:56] ain't talking about skin tight maxi
[1:43:58] skirts then things are sometimes more
[1:44:02] and godly than pants preach brother
[1:44:04] Samuel I will but he makes you want to
[1:44:12] look at me say hey are you a Christian
[1:44:15] why would you do that
[1:44:17] because you're seeing somebody who's
[1:44:20] taking a stand that's different from
[1:44:23] everything else you're used to see and
[1:44:25] you you as they believe or know that's
[1:44:27] God's Word it's somebody that they must
[1:44:30] have an honor it must be something maybe
[1:44:33] they were taught by mama or daddy and
[1:44:35] they never had that experience yet but
[1:44:37] there's still something about it
[1:44:38] they reverence that it's a sign let me
[1:44:50] just be very clear a person could have
[1:44:52] all of that right there and still not
[1:44:55] have the Holy Ghost but a person is not
[1:44:58] going to have the Holy Ghost and still
[1:45:01] have all the other things in the flesh
[1:45:05] walking around in miniskirts or walking
[1:45:08] around with high heels or you know
[1:45:10] putting on a little bit of lipstick I
[1:45:11] got to give myself a little bit of color
[1:45:13] if you get in the presence of God like
[1:45:16] Moses got in the presence of God in the
[1:45:18] book of Exodus the Bible says he didn't
[1:45:21] need maxfactor
[1:45:22] to make himself distinguished it was the
[1:45:25] glory of the Lord that came upon his
[1:45:28] life
[1:45:30] I know sometimes people want to use
[1:45:38] quotes they want to use I'm not against
[1:45:41] quotes you know right now tonight you
[1:45:44] know right now I'm speaking to you the
[1:45:46] truth right through God's Word but I
[1:45:48] don't believe in taking a quote and
[1:45:50] trying to hide sin that's a trick of the
[1:45:55] devil to take your soul to hell any
[1:46:02] child that refused circumcision well how
[1:46:05] could listen how could any child eight
[1:46:09] days old
[1:46:10] how could they say
[1:46:16] they don't know what's happening but
[1:46:18] their fathers Oh Lord their parents know
[1:46:24] the value of the world that they are
[1:46:27] under and their parents show that value
[1:46:33] that has been released in them and the
[1:46:35] value it causes them to take that
[1:46:38] household and hold that household to the
[1:46:41] word
[1:46:49] we're not talking about little
[1:46:52] itty-bitty fellas just eight days old
[1:46:54] we're talking about when it comes to a
[1:46:58] time to be circumcised by the God who
[1:47:04] made the promise to bring you fully in
[1:47:08] to the promised
[1:47:15] if that man was not circumcised he could
[1:47:19] have no fellowship with the rest of the
[1:47:21] congregation if we refuse to go to be
[1:47:25] circumcised he might go to their
[1:47:27] fellowship dinners but he don't have
[1:47:28] fellowship with him he might come to the
[1:47:32] church for that but it don't have
[1:47:33] fellowship because you see that
[1:47:36] fellowship ends on earthly things but
[1:47:42] we're talking about a fellowship that
[1:47:43] speaks in first John won a fellowship
[1:47:47] with Jesus Christ
[1:47:49] with Almighty God and that same
[1:47:52] fellowship among believers by having
[1:47:55] that same nature on the inside of them
[1:47:59] they've got things in common
[1:48:02] doves love doves you don't see dust
[1:48:07] flocking around with a bunch of crows
[1:48:11] doves seek for doubts and the Dove of
[1:48:14] the Holy Ghost in you seeks for that
[1:48:18] part of the Dove and somebody else
[1:48:21] that's how we can fellowship with the
[1:48:24] mystery it's fellowshipping with God in
[1:48:29] the word that's why we can look at Ruth
[1:48:31] and says that's me what are we doing
[1:48:34] with fellowshipping with the mystery of
[1:48:36] Christ that was in Ruth's life we have
[1:48:42] fellowship a person they refuse a person
[1:48:50] that refuses the baptism of the Holy
[1:48:52] Ghost that have no fellowship among
[1:48:55] those who have the Holy Ghost
[1:49:01] that's why person who doesn't have the
[1:49:03] Holy Ghost doesn't know what the joy of
[1:49:05] the Lord is
[1:49:09] they think we're you're you're off in
[1:49:12] your head yeah yeah somebody set me free
[1:49:16] I'm no longer what I used to be I found
[1:49:19] real joy amen
[1:49:28] you bring me joy lord I feel like
[1:49:33] singing but we're going to preach this
[1:49:37] is why the Bible says listen to me these
[1:49:39] are words of life jure jesus said my
[1:49:41] words that I speak to you they are
[1:49:42] spirit and life in 1st Corinthians
[1:49:49] chapter 12 for about verse 13 for by one
[1:49:51] spirit we are all baptized into one body
[1:49:54] whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether
[1:49:57] we be bond or free and have been made
[1:50:01] all to drink into one spirit it don't
[1:50:10] matter what your nationality is Jesus is
[1:50:14] a segregationist oh you better believe
[1:50:17] it he's a segregationist yes sir the
[1:50:23] Bible said when he was here he was
[1:50:25] separate from sinners in John 17 and
[1:50:29] while I am in the world but I'm not up
[1:50:31] this world he expects us to separate
[1:50:36] from sin he pulls on the heartstrings of
[1:50:41] our heart to him don't worry when he
[1:50:45] pulls on the heart and the heart begins
[1:50:47] to go sin will flee they need not have
[1:50:50] to give this up no it's just he there's
[1:50:53] something greater that's got ahold of me
[1:51:06] in the book of Joshua
[1:51:14] the Bible says here in verse 1 of Joshua
[1:51:19] 5 God let it be known to the people of
[1:51:26] Israel that the inhabitants of the land
[1:51:29] are melting with fear because the Lord
[1:51:33] is among you
[1:51:39] but God said that's not enough
[1:51:43] I want to confirm my word of promise
[1:51:45] with you so when you're out there in
[1:51:49] your section of the inheritance so you
[1:51:51] have the faith to go and take what
[1:51:52] belongs to you and when you're out there
[1:51:56] is a sign there's a token of my presence
[1:51:59] with you that whether you fill it or not
[1:52:03] you've got a seal
[1:52:09] verse 2 at that time the Lord said unto
[1:52:11] Joshua make these sharp knives can be
[1:52:16] dull knives you might leave some of the
[1:52:18] flesh on that's why they get a lot of
[1:52:22] church members that still have all sorts
[1:52:25] of habits of sin
[1:52:27] that's one reason because it's not sharp
[1:52:32] knives and brother there's only one
[1:52:35] knife I know that shark and that is
[1:52:38] Hebrews 4:12 the Word of God is sharper
[1:52:41] than in a two-edged sword and the Bible
[1:52:46] said Joshua he was told by the Lord make
[1:52:50] these short knives he was in this time
[1:52:52] make short knives and circumcise the
[1:52:56] children of Israel the second time God
[1:53:00] had spoke to Abraham in Genesis 17
[1:53:03] before the oncoming visitation and
[1:53:06] promised and God made a circumcision now
[1:53:09] God is standing once again and God is
[1:53:13] calling for a circumcision there must be
[1:53:15] a circumcision you must have the seal
[1:53:18] the token of the Covenant in your life
[1:53:23] and Joshua
[1:53:29] yes your Jesus Jehovah Savior come on
[1:53:37] somebody and Joshua made him sharp
[1:53:40] knives a man can't make a short knife
[1:53:43] Joshua is a type of the Holy Ghost the
[1:53:46] Holy Ghost can take that word and
[1:53:48] brother it's sharp
[1:53:50] it pierces even to the dividing asunder
[1:53:53] of soul and spirit the bone from the
[1:53:58] morrow that's the word there's that
[1:54:01] right the sharp knives who does that
[1:54:03] the Holy Ghost here he is he is with
[1:54:06] sharp knife he's not leaving a guess he
[1:54:10] comes to circumcise to separate his
[1:54:15] people from the rest of the peoples of
[1:54:20] the earth and he circumcised the
[1:54:23] children of Israel at the heel of
[1:54:25] foreskin this is why it goes on verse 4
[1:54:28] this is why Joshua did circumcise he's
[1:54:30] listened just like Joshua's idea
[1:54:35] just one said I'm gonna be like Abraham
[1:54:37] no God who spoke to Abraham where
[1:54:41] Abraham acted like God Joshua was acting
[1:54:45] like God who acted through Abraham all
[1:54:51] the people that came out of Egypt they
[1:54:53] all came out here they came out of Egypt
[1:54:54] they were males even all the men of war
[1:54:56] died in the wilderness by the way after
[1:54:58] they came out of Egypt now all the
[1:55:00] people that came out were circumcised
[1:55:02] but all the people that were born in the
[1:55:04] wilderness by the way as they came forth
[1:55:06] out of Egypt then they had not
[1:55:08] circumcised for the children walk forty
[1:55:11] years in the wilderness to all the men
[1:55:14] of war which came out of Egypt God let
[1:55:18] every one of them died that doubted his
[1:55:19] promise is that right thirty years old
[1:55:23] and upward cut off God cut those who
[1:55:26] started honoring that play God cut him
[1:55:29] off right away
[1:55:30] two souls to speak against the promise
[1:55:34] of God is to be cut off cuz you're
[1:55:38] calling God a liar well we're not here
[1:55:43] to call God a liar this morning here to
[1:55:46] say he is faithful he is true every word
[1:55:51] he said is yay and a man they were
[1:55:57] consumed because they obey not
[1:56:01] our unison the voice of the Lord they
[1:56:06] had the written word but they didn't
[1:56:09] obey the voice the voice they neglected
[1:56:15] to hear the voice
[1:56:17] that's why Paul could go on and say and
[1:56:19] he Bruce throughout Hebrews four Hebrews
[1:56:22] 12 they who refused to hear his voice
[1:56:25] were overthrown
[1:56:29] you see we're not walking in this
[1:56:32] because of our ability to read we have
[1:56:36] heard his voice it had been declared
[1:56:40] hear ye him the Lord swear unto their
[1:56:47] fathers that he would give us a land
[1:56:49] that full of the milk and I looked for
[1:56:50] seven and their children
[1:56:53] whom he raised up in their stead they
[1:56:56] had said our children will be consumed
[1:57:00] in this land our children aren't able to
[1:57:03] handle this strong diet
[1:57:06] well who made you able to handle it will
[1:57:12] you not have been around it these are
[1:57:13] many years then you ought to have
[1:57:16] confidence in the God that has fed you
[1:57:19] and to know that same God is the one who
[1:57:23] revealed it to you by His grace that God
[1:57:26] does not look upon man with respect to
[1:57:30] persons God who are you telling me I'm
[1:57:33] telling you to hold that word and
[1:57:34] confidence don't be wishy-washy over
[1:57:37] your family and try to water it down yet
[1:57:40] you can't eat this lamb sodden that's
[1:57:44] the word you can't eat the lamb son
[1:57:47] you've got to eat it roasted with fire
[1:57:51] it's gotta be the fire of the Holy Ghost
[1:57:54] in you and to have that token that seal
[1:58:00] that confidence you say what God did for
[1:58:04] me he will do for my children and I'm
[1:58:12] going to be diligent to make sure that
[1:58:15] their lives are like the stones that's
[1:58:17] gathered the wood that's on it and their
[1:58:19] lives are so brought in a place of
[1:58:21] willingness I know I know listen to me
[1:58:27] now sometimes you know you get to
[1:58:29] looking at something and let me just say
[1:58:31] to you like this God will not leave one
[1:58:36] of his own behind you understand when
[1:58:39] I'm addressing here this morning I'm
[1:58:41] addressing a careless attitude I'm
[1:58:44] addressing the carelessness also I've
[1:58:47] just went pro destinated they'll make it
[1:58:50] shame on you
[1:58:51] my question is do you even know what the
[1:58:55] predestination of God is
[1:58:59] predestination isn't God picking us up
[1:59:02] by the neck and carrying us along
[1:59:06] neither is it us making all the right
[1:59:08] decisions but it's us heeding to his
[1:59:12] voice
[1:59:13] following diligently after him even when
[1:59:17] he corrects us we believe him because he
[1:59:19] said it hallelujah when that happens
[1:59:25] righteousness is there in the bank
[1:59:27] account God raised him up Satan came the
[1:59:41] Bible said King was of that wicked one
[1:59:44] first John 5 you know what I'm talking
[1:59:46] about Cain was not a seed of God because
[1:59:54] even when he was confronted with the
[1:59:55] word he spit it back in God's face this
[1:59:59] is how I'm gonna worship you you take it
[2:00:00] or you leave it and he got so jealous at
[2:00:08] God coming down and vindicating Abel
[2:00:10] sacrifice Abel didn't vindicate Abel
[2:00:13] sacrifice God vindicated it and he got
[2:00:19] upset with the vindication of God that
[2:00:25] vindication that witness was a seal
[2:00:28] Abel's righteous
[2:00:34] became slew Abel but God raised up a
[2:00:40] seed instead of Abel Abel went down but
[2:00:45] here came a Seth death burial
[2:00:47] resurrection hallelujah you cannot
[2:00:52] remove the promise of God God is not a
[2:00:57] man that he should lie you know the son
[2:00:59] of man that he should repent God would
[2:01:08] take them on in verse 8 it came to pass
[2:01:10] when they had done circumcised and all
[2:01:12] the people that they abode in their
[2:01:13] places in the camp till they were whole
[2:01:17] and the Lord said unto Joshua pinch
[2:01:22] yourself right here I'm trying to get
[2:01:24] you to somewhere here
[2:01:32] and the Lord said unto Joshua this day
[2:01:39] have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt
[2:01:45] from of--they that condemnation that's
[2:01:51] been upon you because there was a tie to
[2:01:57] Egypt though they were in the wilderness
[2:01:59] by their nature they were still in Egypt
[2:02:03] right they were in process of coming in
[2:02:06] the van there's two parts of Redemption
[2:02:07] come out and go into they still had that
[2:02:12] about their life but when they come in
[2:02:15] sharp knives are present in this land
[2:02:18] this is a land that God has promised in
[2:02:22] this hour
[2:02:25] amen I understand by the books this is
[2:02:28] the hour Amen this is the hour this is a
[2:02:33] time in this day notice Joshua was the
[2:02:36] one who made sharp knives they removed
[2:02:39] the foreskin of the male's is that right
[2:02:44] circumcise them and God was removing
[2:02:48] that identification that still tied them
[2:02:52] into Egypt Egypt is a type of the world
[2:02:55] and God said I have come down I have
[2:03:02] rolled away the reproach you know I you
[2:03:05] can't stand the victory with reproach
[2:03:07] over your life you can't stand the
[2:03:10] victory with condemnation over your life
[2:03:16] romans 8:1 there is therefore now no
[2:03:20] condemnation to them who are in Christ
[2:03:24] Jesus who walk not according to the law
[2:03:28] of the flesh but they walk according to
[2:03:30] the law the spirit of life he hath made
[2:03:35] me free I said he had made me free he
[2:03:40] had made you free what did he do he
[2:03:42] rolled away the reproach Satan can come
[2:03:47] and try to tell but you can say I got a
[2:03:50] seal he's already been here and sealed
[2:03:55] alone there's no doubt for the world or
[2:04:01] the things of the world you know and
[2:04:05] love not means the word love not means
[2:04:08] enough to be content with well my daddy
[2:04:12] had this problem and this has been a
[2:04:15] family problem so your uplifting your
[2:04:18] natural family and yet claiming you're
[2:04:21] united with an Almighty God
[2:04:24] when you've been united that may be true
[2:04:27] there can be all sorts of things that
[2:04:29] run in your strength but there's one
[2:04:32] thing about it with a believer we don't
[2:04:34] have to make no excuses there's a bad
[2:04:37] that's able to take care of let not sin
[2:04:43] therefore reign in your mortal body that
[2:04:48] you should obey it
[2:04:50] remove the reproach roll it away it's
[2:04:54] God's distinction
[2:04:56] god made a difference in Egypt
[2:05:00] remember in Egypt he said I'll show you
[2:05:02] how the Lord doesn't make a difference
[2:05:05] is to be under the blood not just
[2:05:07] believe on the blood but to be under it
[2:05:10] and their lower to be under that blood
[2:05:12] is to have the life that was in that
[2:05:14] blood sale come and bring you in to that
[2:05:17] blood to where then he no longer sees
[2:05:20] you but he sees the blood when Abel came
[2:05:24] with his sacrifice God did not see Abel
[2:05:27] he saw his sacrifice when Cain came with
[2:05:29] his sacrifice God saw King so right but
[2:05:35] under the blood he's looking he's
[2:05:37] looking at the blood it brings us into
[2:05:42] fellowship with God and he look at this
[2:05:45] from Colossians 1:12 I'm getting
[2:05:46] somewhere let me tell you this this food
[2:05:51] right here is more important than any
[2:05:52] food that you could eat naturally you
[2:05:55] could eat a good meal right now and die
[2:05:56] tomorrow or die within the next hour but
[2:05:59] he that eateth they eat it on this shall
[2:06:01] never die
[2:06:02] and I ask you believe us about this
[2:06:09] Colossians 1:12 giving thanks all I
[2:06:12] think that's what we ought to do give
[2:06:13] thanks unto the Father which hath made
[2:06:16] us meet qualified oh if I can get good
[2:06:22] enough what you want if you can get good
[2:06:24] enough why do we need Calvary Calvary is
[2:06:28] where God become he god shed his blood
[2:06:32] and then he rose up on the Easter
[2:06:35] morning and said go tell my people but I
[2:06:42] have meat away well I'm not good enough
[2:06:47] it ain't you that qualifies you I
[2:06:49] qualified you right now know your
[2:06:54] qualities it comes from before the
[2:06:56] foundation of the world you are chosen
[2:06:58] and me and that's why there's a time on
[2:07:01] your life and you can't be satisfied in
[2:07:05] the world you tried this you tried that
[2:07:08] you tried this but you can't be
[2:07:10] satisfied
[2:07:12] why he is your qualifier am I qualified
[2:07:20] to receive the Holy Ghost he is our
[2:07:23] qualifier which have made us qualified
[2:07:33] to be partakers of the inheritance you
[2:07:38] see that it was already your inheritance
[2:07:42] you just not recognize what belongs to
[2:07:46] you it might have said on the coffee
[2:07:49] table for a long time you might have
[2:07:53] heard him being preached for a long time
[2:07:55] but all of a sudden the Covenant it
[2:07:58] starts coming forth it's not just a
[2:08:00] Bible this is a covenant it's coming
[2:08:03] forth these are not just words a men who
[2:08:05] remove no it was the Holy Ghost that
[2:08:08] moved upon men of old that were
[2:08:10] separated to be vessels that God could
[2:08:13] speak through and that same cloth comes
[2:08:16] down and he draws on that heart and he
[2:08:18] says come unto me all you are heavy
[2:08:21] laden and I will give you rest
[2:08:32] verse 10 of the Colossians 2
[2:08:39] well I'm gonna say may not be real
[2:08:40] spiritual but it'll help you if you'll
[2:08:43] just get focused on what's coming next
[2:08:45] instead of focusing on whether I'm going
[2:08:48] to say let's stand you have a whole lot
[2:08:51] better time because I'm already standing
[2:09:00] and ye are complete in him which is the
[2:09:04] head of all principality and power in
[2:09:07] whom ye are circumcised you mean that's
[2:09:14] not an Old Covenant thing that was a
[2:09:19] type a type in whom also ye are
[2:09:26] circumcised with the circumcision made
[2:09:29] without hands in putting off the body of
[2:09:34] the sins of the flesh you that old man I
[2:09:40] said old man somebody say with me old
[2:09:42] man
[2:09:50] mm-hmm

[2:09:55] the flesh by the circumcision of Christ
[2:09:57] buried with him in Baptism wherein also
[2:10:03] you are risen with him through the faith
[2:10:05] of the operation of God you catch that
[2:10:08] the operation of God the operation of

[2:10:29] through the years I'm really in every
[2:10:32] age to perform the circumcision Alleluia

[2:11:23] be there to circumcise my children to
[2:11:25] separate them from the things of the
[2:11:27] world and you verse thirteen being dead

[2:13:44] Ordinances that was against us which was
[2:13:46] contrary to us and took it out of the
[2:13:48] way nailing it to his cross or brother
[2:13:54] salmon Jesus did away with the law no he
[2:13:58] simply came and fulfilled it by the
[2:14:01] spirit of the law giver himself and now

[2:14:55] yeah but I can't do it no more because
[2:14:58] you know I've got a family and I got to
[2:15:01] be more responsible and you know I made
[2:15:04] promises and not
[2:15:06] you know I just changed really
[2:15:16] really is that what did it no
[2:15:25] God knew that cleaning up a pig you
[2:15:29] could clean up a pig but if you didn't
[2:15:31] get rid of the pig nature first chance
[2:15:34] that pig got he'd be right back in the
[2:15:35] mud hole but even if that pig could say
[2:15:38] I ain't going back on that muddle but if
[2:15:40] a pig steel could stay inside he can
[2:15:42] stay clean but if he still longs to go
[2:15:43] in the mud hole he's still guilty you
[2:15:48] with me still guilty because he still
[2:15:51] has the desire for evil are you with me
[2:15:56] now but it's got to roll away the
[2:15:58] reproach he's got to roll away the
[2:16:01] reproach of Egypt that old nature but
[2:16:04] there's been a resurrection on the
[2:16:08] inside the Bible would say you're a new
[2:16:11] creation in Christ Jesus and you act
[2:16:19] like a Christian ought to act you live
[2:16:23] like a Christian ought to live you know
[2:16:25] why because there's a life on the inside
[2:16:27] of you
[2:16:29] that makes you do it you fussing and
[2:16:35] screaming no it's now it's a life if you
[2:16:38] take out the life that was on the inside
[2:16:40] and you put that life of a lamb nature
[2:16:43] on the inside you could have a pig
[2:16:46] walking all around still looks like a
[2:16:47] pig I said still looks like a pig I do
[2:16:51] in more ways than one but still look
[2:16:53] like a pig but on the inside there's a
[2:16:59] sheep nature the smell of the mat no I
[2:17:03] don't bother me it just reminds me of
[2:17:05] where he brought me from yeah I used to
[2:17:09] walk around out there but but he changed
[2:17:13] me you mean you don't want to do it no
[2:17:16] more I know I look like that I should
[2:17:19] want to but all if you ever get changed
[2:17:22] in there you no longer want the world or
[2:17:27] the things of the world if you ever get
[2:17:30] really circumcised not with your not
[2:17:34] with your little scriptures not with
[2:17:35] your little quotes it could still leave
[2:17:38] things dull
[2:17:39] it's got to be sharp sharp that
[2:17:44] separates from the world an approach is
[2:17:51] gone now you're dwelling in the land of
[2:17:54] promise by the circumcision of the Holy
[2:17:56] Ghost
[2:17:56] it's a confirmation of your faith that
[2:17:58] every promise belongs to you you look at
[2:18:03] and you say that promise is mine
[2:18:07] you see what the seal does it brings the
[2:18:12] reality you're walking with the seal to
[2:18:14] declare the promises that belong to you
[2:18:16] as a believer listen to me carefully now
[2:18:19] you can look at those promises and say
[2:18:22] every promise when that is come the
[2:18:26] spirit of truth he will lead and guide
[2:18:28] you into all truth it guides you into
[2:18:32] the fullness of what God has promised
[2:18:35] and made real for that generation and
[2:18:37] rather for this generation it is the
[2:18:42] indwelling of the person of Jesus Christ
[2:18:44] the Son of man revealed in a bride's
[2:18:48] body and the promise of the rapture
[2:18:55] we're given authority to obtain these
[2:18:58] promises
[2:19:08] you're different when it comes on you
[2:19:14] until the mind of this world don't act
[2:19:16] like you they're against you and they
[2:19:20] don't want nothing to do with you at all
[2:19:22] you're born of another world you are
[2:19:27] just as much listen to this you are just
[2:19:29] as much an alien ten times more an alien
[2:19:34] than if they picked you up and put you
[2:19:35] in a remote section of Africa or in
[2:19:41] South America or wherever were there
[2:19:46] people you know like the people that and
[2:19:48] some of them places where they sit down
[2:19:50] they sit down a white man they'd never
[2:19:51] seen a white man never knew there was
[2:19:53] any other different color they looked at
[2:19:56] him when you'd been born of the Spirit
[2:20:00] of God you are more of an alien to this
[2:20:03] world than if they put you there you've
[2:20:09] been born of another world and that's
[2:20:14] what the Holy Ghost is it's a sign it's
[2:20:19] a circumcision you're different when it
[2:20:23] comes it's a sign your thinking is
[2:20:26] different not just your thinking up here
[2:20:30] but the mind
[2:20:31] you've been sealed the Bible say sealed
[2:20:33] in their forehead it's not some sign up
[2:20:34] here that talks about the receiving the
[2:20:36] mind of Christ come on somebody the mind
[2:20:40] of Christ they meant to be aware this is
[2:20:44] what God promised and I am a part of
[2:20:46] that promise you're sealed in your
[2:20:50] forehead amen you have the mind of
[2:20:53] Christ amen on the inside of you and you
[2:20:57] become a pilgrim and a stranger you
[2:21:02] don't just got the passport rather
[2:21:04] you've got the seal of the visa
[2:21:08] guaranteed entry

[2:21:17] a visa until like five days before how
[2:21:22] would I got to Ghana and the flight that

[2:21:55] passport I show that I'm a citizen of
[2:21:58] the United States
[2:22:01] uh-huh but in order to gain entry here
[2:22:05] in Ghana into this other country you've
[2:22:10] got to receive the seal from our embassy
[2:22:13] and we've got officers I didn't have to
[2:22:19] send to Ghana to get the visa for Ghana
[2:22:21] I sent there was local representatives
[2:22:25] in the nation I'm living and they were
[2:22:30] able to minister to me the seal on my
[2:22:35] passport that way I could look at that
[2:22:37] and say I've got all that's required I
[2:22:40] got my yellow fever shot I've been
[2:22:42] inoculated by the Holy Ghost I could go
[2:22:45] ahead on the plane and say blessed be
[2:22:48] the name of the Lord I've already got a
[2:22:50] guaranteed entry how can you be so sure
[2:22:54] I've received the earnest the visa has
[2:22:59] come if I go prepare a place for you
[2:23:14] I will come again and I will put my visa
[2:23:18] up on your passport which shows you've
[2:23:28] got the wedding room you've already got
[2:23:32] the guarantee
[2:23:37] I'm gonna pause right here and I know I
[2:23:41] preached a little longer I know
[2:23:43] sometimes I preach a little long as it
[2:23:45] is but I want you to understand right
[2:23:47] here I'm dragging my feet through these
[2:23:52] things because that's what God told me
[2:23:54] to do I've tried my best to hold it so
[2:23:59] that it's not things where I'm out here
[2:24:00] ministering out on different parts I
[2:24:05] want it to be drove down like a nail
[2:24:13] how many services how long it takes he
[2:24:18] knows I didn't I wasn't even looking at
[2:24:21] this going this direction but he knows I
[2:24:26] was in one way but he kind of directed a
[2:24:30] little bit and said we'll save this for
[2:24:31] later after all I'm just the one who
[2:24:35] serves I don't cook it I don't order it
[2:24:38] he does he
[2:24:44] but I'll set to you like this let me
[2:24:47] just say to you if you don't have the
[2:24:50] Holy Ghost the first thing you need to
[2:24:54] do is just evaluate have you done all
[2:24:57] that God's asked you to do
[2:25:01] have you repented
[2:25:07] and if you've repented
[2:25:11] and you've been baptized in the name of
[2:25:13] Jesus Christ and the Bible says you
[2:25:17] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[2:25:26] there's some keywords sometimes that we
[2:25:28] overlook the gift
[2:25:37] in case you don't know him my birthday's
[2:25:38] coming up
[2:25:50] birthdays used to mean a whole lot more
[2:25:51] to me before now it's just another
[2:25:54] passing the one thing I do look forward
[2:25:56] to Billy do I get the dessert I want
[2:26:03] in there right honey
[2:26:07] in the presence of all these witnesses
[2:26:16] but let's see
[2:26:22] here's a box
[2:26:25] and it's a gift
[2:26:28] now let's say that you came to my
[2:26:33] birthday party
[2:26:37] when you came to my birthday party you
[2:26:40] will make sure you bring a gift
[2:26:45] now you know I'm just using this as an
[2:26:47] example right I'm not trying to drop
[2:26:49] hints
[2:26:55] but that gift when you walk in the door
[2:26:57] with it brother Brian if you walked in
[2:26:59] my door with a box and head rapping on
[2:27:01] it or maybe you have one of them little
[2:27:03] bags coffee beans in and or something
[2:27:06] like that
[2:27:13] by the way if you walked in with that
[2:27:14] box you know what I wouldn't be
[2:27:17] wondering I mean I may have a little bit
[2:27:19] of a question like I wonder if that's
[2:27:21] for me but then if you take that gift
[2:27:28] this box and you see where my wife has
[2:27:32] the table it's decorated by the joint
[2:27:35] it's got the cake on it and I'll see you
[2:27:39] will look over it and you set it down
[2:27:42] right there I know that's my gift
[2:27:50] I didn't ask you for it
[2:27:54] I didn't earn it matter of fact maybe I
[2:27:57] had offended you or maybe I said
[2:27:58] something or didn't say something so you
[2:28:00] didn't bring it because I earned it but
[2:28:06] a real gift for the joy when somebody
[2:28:09] gives a gift it's not out of the wrong
[2:28:14] motive with strings attached to it
[2:28:23] it comes from the heart
[2:28:27] and the heart of God is Christ God so
[2:28:33] loved the world that He gave His only
[2:28:35] begotten Son God came down and said
[2:28:37] these promises I'm gonna let you know
[2:28:40] it's for you I'm gonna come down and
[2:28:42] walk among you I'm gonna show you what's
[2:28:51] in here it's for you because I'm gonna
[2:28:55] wrap it on the outside in a body that
[2:29:00] can age can be tempted we have to turn
[2:29:05] its head and walk away I'll wrap it
[2:29:10] in humanity and I will so set it down
[2:29:15] that you will recognize they will
[2:29:19] minister to you this is the promise
[2:29:28] when that gift comes in and is set down
[2:29:32] by my cake the greatest thing that I
[2:29:36] could do is say thank you thank you
[2:29:43] because I know you've got something in
[2:29:45] you you got something and you thought of
[2:29:49] me you see what that is the gift shows
[2:29:53] you were in somebody's thinking before
[2:29:56] they ever showed up with a gift you were
[2:30:02] in his mind before the foundation of the
[2:30:04] world he sets down the gift elster
[2:30:12] listen to me look at somebody and say
[2:30:15] listen
[2:30:22] the worst thing I can do is leave this
[2:30:26] set
[2:30:30] but the greatest thing I can do is to
[2:30:33] take it and to open it up
[2:30:39] he was bruised from my iniquities
[2:30:43] chastisement of my peace was upon him
[2:30:45] God opened his side that he might
[2:30:54] release what I needed I didn't even
[2:31:01] catch this before
[2:31:01] I wasn't able to see without this except
[2:31:13] a man be born again he cannot even enter
[2:31:16] the kingdom it's to receive that gift
[2:31:25] because it's got your name on it when I
[2:31:31] when y'all open that box or to receive
[2:31:33] that of the Holy Ghost brother Trevor to
[2:31:36] make it mind to say Lord I want that
[2:31:39] gift that's for me that's to open that
[2:31:43] box with faith and say Lord you've given
[2:31:47] it for me and you opened that up by
[2:31:50] faith faith said he made it available
[2:31:53] for me and you open that up and you just
[2:31:58] receive it that's the greatest honor and
[2:32:01] compliment that we could ever give the
[2:32:05] Lord Jesus Christ Almighty God to
[2:32:08] receive the gift that he has sent and to
[2:32:15] take that
[2:32:19] well things but different now
[2:32:22] I see ministries I'm seeing things
[2:32:27] differently now
[2:32:28] things look different why there's a
[2:32:31] different site that's coming I never
[2:32:34] forget as a young man when I said in the
[2:32:37] back of the class and I had to ask
[2:32:38] people I thought it was normal to ask
[2:32:41] them that can't see your notes you won't
[2:32:42] because while mom and daddy didn't take
[2:32:43] me you know back in the days when I was
[2:32:46] growing up in 3rd 13 and 42 cooler
[2:32:49] classes man
[2:32:53] but ago I didn't know what was going on
[2:32:55] with me I was asking people hey he's
[2:32:58] here notes we had teachers back then
[2:33:00] that wrote a lot of notes
[2:33:08] then one day brother rich me somebody
[2:33:13] told my mom and daddy said I think Sam
[2:33:16] needs glasses
[2:33:18] they took me where I needed to go they
[2:33:22] didn't take me to a medical doctor
[2:33:24] brother Scott I love you but they didn't
[2:33:26] take me to a podiatrist you know I love
[2:33:31] you they took me to an optometrist I
[2:33:34] think I got that right they took me to
[2:33:36] an optometrist because they knew he knew
[2:33:38] how to specialize in getting write down
[2:33:40] he was checking certain things he was
[2:33:42] checking things and brother Trevor he
[2:33:44] put this on and I'd look at I'd say
[2:33:46] they'd say read that line
[2:33:48] I just it was hard for me to read them
[2:33:50] letters I was trying I'm trying my all
[2:33:54] to read them then he flipped it again
[2:33:59] how about now it's a little bit more
[2:34:02] cleaner he's this better one or two to
[2:34:09] expose this one off he's trying to work
[2:34:11] it on this house this one
[2:34:13] I have the hardest time trying to see
[2:34:17] myself as a Christian that couldn't be
[2:34:21] me
[2:34:22] am I the Lord that he sent the Holy
[2:34:24] Ghost for then he died for me they
[2:34:31] started doing this
[2:34:38] and then a venture Oh Drake I looked and
[2:34:44] I started being able to read the first
[2:34:47] thought I could read was repent be
[2:34:51] baptized in the name of she said it was
[2:34:52] real big letters listen can you read on
[2:35:00] down
[2:35:05] it took me a little bit Nizar here here
[2:35:06] let me give you a little bit more power
[2:35:10] let me give you some st. to find power
[2:35:12] well it's better one or two and then I
[2:35:17] could read the next line I'm sanctified
[2:35:21] by the blood of Jesus Christ he is my
[2:35:23] sanctification then he asked me said can
[2:35:28] you read that next line boy can you read
[2:35:30] it
[2:35:32] says the gift
[2:35:40] it was to the prophets no no no you're

[2:37:38] kingdom of God and being a citizen of
[2:37:42] the kingdom of God I've got all the
[2:37:44] rights that a citizen has when they want
[2:37:49] to try to take rights from Paul he was a
[2:37:52] Roman citizen
[2:37:53] he said I'm a Roman citizen I got rights
[2:37:56] as a Roman and we are sons and daughters
[2:38:00] of God we have received a kingdom that
[2:38:04] cannot be moved so I say to you this
[2:38:11] morning as I pause I that Paul's took a
[2:38:13] little bit theirs but I said that don't
[2:38:16] want you to understand
[2:38:22] if you haven't received the Holy Ghost
[2:38:27] but now this morning you know it's a
[2:38:30] sign it's a seal that God puts on you
[2:38:36] you don't earn it
[2:38:37] you can't merit it you can't be good
[2:38:40] enough but you must receive it and you
[2:38:47] as he tugs on your heart you surrender
[2:38:50] to him and you let him do his work he
[2:38:56] tells you did the Holy Spirit conviction
[2:38:58] and they'll lay aside this laid aside
[2:38:59] and walk on with him I say this morning
[2:39:08] if you don't have the Holy Ghost and you
[2:39:09] want to receive
[2:39:13] maybe you have the Holy Ghost and I'll
[2:39:15] saying I'm gonna say maybe I say you
[2:39:17] have the Holy Ghost but you want another
[2:39:20] refilling
[2:39:22] maybe you find you've got a little
[2:39:24] careless about things and you said Lord
[2:39:27] I want a refill of the Holy Ghost
[2:39:33] now I don't know what your need is but
[2:39:35] he knows what it is he's the physician
[2:39:39] on call this morning
[2:39:40] and he's here he answers his pagers he
[2:39:45] answers his texts he knew you were going
[2:39:48] to be here this morning so he's made
[2:39:50] sure that he's got the right equipment
[2:39:56] remember don't look at yourself look at
[2:40:01] him
[2:40:04] he can roll away the reproach of Egypt
[2:40:07] right now right off of your life and

[2:40:13] already rolled away here will show out
[2:40:15] here don't you love him
[2:40:25] whether you want the filling of the Holy
[2:40:27] Ghost or you want the refilling of the
[2:40:29] Holy Ghost why don't you stand to your
[2:40:31] feet right now you make your declaration
[2:40:34] in the presence of God the first thing

[2:40:38] little bit it's a sign it's a seal
[2:40:47] in your life
[2:40:53] now I've stood here under his
[2:40:56] inspiration and I'm under his
[2:40:58] inspiration right now
[2:41:02] it could be said as it were as somebody
[2:41:05] from Ghana who's down there at the
[2:41:07] Embassy in Washington DC they've got a
