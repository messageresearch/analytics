[38:42] the Lord
[38:43] vicious power heads in a word of Prayer
[38:47] Heavenly Father
[38:49] Lord what a privilege it is that
[38:53] we can call you our father
[38:56] to know that Lord
[38:58] by Revelation in our hearts
[39:02] that Lord that we have come from you
[39:06] your God we've been placed here in a
[39:08] body of time
[39:10] and Lord Jesus what a certainty it gives
[39:12] us
[39:13] within our hearts that Lord
[39:16] among all the other parts of life that
[39:20] are so uncertain
[39:22] we have that great certainty Lord
[39:24] of your presence of your life and to
[39:28] know that Lord
[39:29] where we are going
[39:32] more and we're so grateful for that Lord
[39:35] we draw strength Lord from you we draw
[39:39] strength from that reality oh God
[39:43] it's a paradox Lord
[39:46] our whole life as a believer
[39:48] it's a paradox
[39:50] for our birth was a paradox that new
[39:54] birth
[39:55] that new birth it's a paradox
[39:58] it's what cannot be explained by the
[40:01] intellects of man
[40:03] as you said in your word that
[40:05] Lord as one cannot tell from whence the
[40:08] wind bloweth no weather where it going
[40:10] so is everyone that is born of the
[40:13] spirit
[40:14] Lord how we thank you Father in our
[40:16] lives it's the most precious precious
[40:18] reality that there is Lord
[40:21] that we know that we have passed from
[40:23] Death unto life
[40:24] and like Paul could say
[40:27] that Lord we believe that you are able
[40:30] to keep that which we have committed
[40:32] unto you against that day
[40:35] God I just asked tonight
[40:37] Lord your blessing on your people
[40:40] father you know every need
[40:43] you know requests that are in Heart
[40:45] Heart Lord requests that have not been
[40:47] wrote down but you know Lord
[40:49] you know the things that Lord that is
[40:51] upon our heart the things that we've
[40:53] prayed about Lord you even know Lord our
[40:57] frustrations our confusions our
[40:59] questions you know about it all Lord
[41:02] father what a comfort it is tonight that
[41:04] we are not coming to stand in the
[41:06] presence of a man
[41:08] but we have come here God as your
[41:10] children Lord to come before your
[41:13] presence that Lord that you might speak
[41:16] to us Lord
[41:17] then you might minister to our hearts
[41:19] the very things that we have need of in
[41:21] our lives and Lord to speak to those
[41:23] needs Lord
[41:24] now father we just give ourselves to you
[41:27] Lord
[41:28] God is speaker and here together and we
[41:30] just invite you that you'll come in a
[41:31] very personal way
[41:33] Lord we just love you and we thank you
[41:35] tonight Lord may you move among your
[41:37] children Lord for every need that's here
[41:39] we pray
[41:40] Lord those that are gathered and will
[41:42] stream it we ask God you just move for
[41:45] them too father
[41:46] in the name of Jesus Christ
[41:49] amen
[41:52] it turned with me to Psalms 84. amen so
[41:55] good to be with you and certainly uh
[41:57] just uh appreciate your your prayers
[42:00] while we were there
[42:03] in the services and uh I don't want to
[42:06] delay too much on that but the Lord just
[42:08] really moved wonderfully in the services
[42:10] and
[42:12] just how God just dealt so personally
[42:14] with hearts and lives and
[42:16] healing deliverance and
[42:19] well on and on and we just thank God for
[42:22] his grace amen he's good isn't he
[42:25] man we we always have an expectation
[42:27] when we we come together and and what
[42:30] he's going to do among us because all it
[42:32] takes is just him to come and my I tell
[42:35] you it goes from impossible to
[42:37] everything is possible amen we're just
[42:41] so glad about that in Psalms 84. I'm
[42:44] just going to read three verses of
[42:45] scripture and let you be seated tonight
[42:46] in verse 8 verse 5 it says blessed is
[42:50] the man whose strength is in thee in
[42:54] whose heart
[42:55] are the ways of them
[42:58] who passing through the Valley of Baca
[43:01] make it a well the rain also filleth the
[43:07] pools they go from strength to strength
[43:10] every one of them in Zion appeareth
[43:14] before God
[43:16] amen may God bless you bless the reading
[43:19] of the word as you're being seated
[43:22] just like to take and go into that
[43:25] second verse there verse six actually
[43:28] where it speaks of who passing through
[43:31] the Valley of Baca make it a well and
[43:35] the rain also filleth the pools
[43:37] and I want to just draw from there
[43:39] tonight you know this passage of
[43:41] scripture I shared this with you before
[43:43] but it's one of these passages of
[43:46] scripture that there's been actually
[43:47] certain times and even in other meetings
[43:49] even over a year ago that I wondered if
[43:52] I would speak upon it but you know it's
[43:53] just something that so God begins to
[43:56] burn on your heart that you recognize
[43:58] it's part of it's part of our journey
[44:01] it's part of what God is doing in our
[44:03] lives and I think that we all can
[44:06] look into the word of God and we'll come
[44:09] here tonight that we might be encouraged
[44:11] in the things of God there's enough
[44:13] things that goes on all around us that
[44:16] is there to try to discourage us and try
[44:19] to worry us try to wear us down but
[44:21] there's one place that as a believer
[44:23] that we really get encouragement from
[44:25] and that's from the word of God
[44:27] sometimes there's things that we don't
[44:29] even sense the impact of the word as
[44:33] we're taking it in and we don't realize
[44:35] it sometimes until sometimes time later
[44:38] and we recognize that God has
[44:41] strengthened us through his word just
[44:43] you and I being available being opened
[44:45] and just receiving from him that to me
[44:49] is a paradox it's just because if God
[44:52] placed it that even that we had to sit
[44:55] here with our minds and try to I need to
[44:57] grasp a hold of every word and I've got
[44:59] to put this all together I'm sure that
[45:02] that's that we would it would it would
[45:04] certainly wouldn't work that way even
[45:06] though we know that God will take his
[45:08] word and the word itself has to be taken
[45:10] in our mind first but I believe that
[45:13] when we come to the house of God we
[45:15] recognize that I'm not here to depend
[45:18] upon my natural abilities God's given me
[45:21] ability to hear but I this is a hearing
[45:23] that I need that goes deeper than my
[45:25] ability to repeat words or to memorize
[45:28] scripture but I had the ability to be
[45:30] able to hear from God personally that
[45:32] God is speaking be to me that God is
[45:35] visiting my tent that God God is coming
[45:38] to minister to my need and that's not
[45:41] just something we're looking at tonight
[45:42] but every single time that we come
[45:45] together that God has something very
[45:48] special for you and I and he's speaking
[45:51] to our lives God doesn't get uh you know
[45:54] short with us as a matter of fact
[45:56] there's no patience that can compare to
[45:58] the patience of God there's no long
[46:01] suffering that could compare to the
[46:02] long-suffering of our Lord Jesus and how
[46:05] that God will work and move and minister
[46:07] to our lives and in such a personal way
[46:10] and I just want to just take that
[46:12] thought just for a few moments on the
[46:15] passing through the Valley of Baca and
[46:18] looking at this this point of scripture
[46:20] because as we took this last week and
[46:23] we're looking at
[46:25] of of appropriate responses to things
[46:28] and how that we respond even in the
[46:31] midst of a test of a trial and we need
[46:33] we need something much deeper than just
[46:36] our DNA we need something deeper we we
[46:40] have to have something more that's than
[46:42] just our ability or our patients because
[46:45] we recognize that a lot of that a lot
[46:47] there might be individuals you know that
[46:49] they seem very very patient and they've
[46:51] got that virtue in their life but the
[46:54] difference between it being a natural
[46:56] virtue and a god-given virtue is the
[46:59] Holy Ghost because when the Holy Spirit
[47:01] has come into our lives then it's not us
[47:04] exhibiting patience but it is God inside
[47:07] of us that in the midst of the trial we
[47:10] are patient enduring and looking to God
[47:13] as a matter of fact every one of those
[47:14] virtues if you are acquainted with that
[47:17] of the Statue of a perfect man these are
[47:19] not just things that are these are not
[47:20] things that are just added to us and we
[47:22] walk out of service and we walk out as
[47:24] just you know uh pyramids were walking
[47:26] out but the reality is is every one of
[47:29] those virtues have already been packed
[47:31] into our life and when the Holy Spirit
[47:33] has come he seals every one of those
[47:36] virtues within our life and his tests
[47:39] and trials every one of those virtues
[47:40] that you look at they are manifested in
[47:43] times of adversity so what really
[47:46] declares that the bride is the bride is
[47:49] the word and and we know that even in
[47:51] the midst of tests and trials this is
[47:53] where the word is made manifest because
[47:55] we can all rejoice as many times we can
[47:58] look at the word and we can Rejoice but
[48:01] where it comes down to is does the word
[48:03] itself live and produce what the word is
[48:07] saying and when tests and Trials Come is
[48:10] that word living is it something that's
[48:13] a substance and a strength in our life
[48:16] that generates a power that we're able
[48:19] to stand within that moment because
[48:21] that's the promise of the word
[48:24] you understand me that's the promise of
[48:26] the word so when when new we write here
[48:28] in the scripture blessed is the man as
[48:31] David could say in that first verse
[48:33] whose strength is in you he's drawing
[48:37] his strength from God there let me just
[48:41] say it this way it's not something as
[48:43] though that you know just coming by and
[48:46] god-giving strength once in a while but
[48:49] this man is connected to God
[48:53] there is a Lifeline there if I can say
[48:57] it like this there is such a union that
[49:01] he can say the Lord is the strength of
[49:05] my life
[49:06] and that's that's the that's the very
[49:09] equality of the Rapture where you and I
[49:12] are able to say God is my strength he's
[49:15] the one I'm drawing strength from in my
[49:18] life David said my enemies came around
[49:21] me and what was the purpose of the
[49:23] enemies to destroy him but he said they
[49:27] came around my flesh but they stumbled
[49:29] and fell why did they stumble and fall
[49:32] because David was standing in the very
[49:35] line of duty in the purpose of God and
[49:37] it was God's strength that was
[49:39] permeating in his life that gave him the
[49:43] ability to endure in the midst when
[49:46] things had encroached all around him so
[49:49] there's no glory that David could take
[49:51] there's no glory that you and I can take
[49:53] all the glory goes to God blessed is the
[49:57] man in whose strength is in you
[50:01] whose heart and we pulled this out is
[50:05] sat on pilgrimage
[50:07] or if we could ever sing that song this
[50:09] world is not my home
[50:11] you see you can tell by the way that you
[50:15] live where is your heart
[50:18] you see if your heart is still tight to
[50:21] this earth here you'll live for this
[50:23] Earth
[50:24] you live for these means remember that's
[50:27] why the test came to job Satan said I
[50:31] know man I know his weakness you let me
[50:35] touch everything that's around me
[50:38] and I promise you he'll curse you to
[50:40] your face
[50:42] you know what Satan was making a bet on
[50:44] he knew the weakness of man of that
[50:47] first birth because that first birth is
[50:49] what's is we came because one in the
[50:52] beginning let down on the word in the in
[50:55] the in the whole Battle of reasoning and
[50:58] so Satan knows let me tell you something
[51:00] brother put it this clear Satan is the
[51:03] near Kinsman of our first birth
[51:06] are you hearing me now kinsman redeemer
[51:08] remember when Boaz came to redeem Bruce
[51:10] he could not straight go and redeem her
[51:12] he first had to come to the nearest
[51:15] kenchman and ask him are you able to do
[51:18] the work
[51:19] and the nearest Kinsmen said I cannot do
[51:22] it lest I'm Mar my inheritance that's
[51:25] why brother REM said the devil could not
[51:27] be nothing different and take away the
[51:29] devil it would Mar who he is he's the
[51:31] devil but there is one who stands for
[51:34] you and I that's able to say I will take
[51:36] the reproach I will bear the reproach
[51:39] and I will do for them what none other
[51:42] can do
[51:45] blessed be the name of the Lord
[51:48] whose heart is set on pilgrimage why our
[51:51] focus is not upon this Earth
[51:58] we've got a place we're going let me
[52:01] just say this we have a place we're
[52:03] going we have a promise every other age
[52:07] has a promise of overcoming I'll give
[52:10] you to either Tree of Life uh you shall
[52:12] partake of the Hidden Manna I'll give
[52:14] you a stone wherein a white stone
[52:16] wearing a new name is written all of
[52:18] those promises are to the Overcomers in
[52:22] every age in each age and then here we
[52:25] come to the end and this age it is then
[52:28] an inheriting of all of those promises
[52:31] and here we stand where God made a
[52:34] promise that that he that overcometh
[52:37] shall set with me in my domain in my
[52:41] father's throne even as I also overcame
[52:46] and am set down
[52:48] so in the same process you know Jesus
[52:51] was announcing now think about this this
[52:53] was not something that Jesus was making
[52:55] up he catches John up and lets John
[52:59] behold his coming
[53:01] remember the second coming of the Lord
[53:04] has been going on when the Holy Ghost
[53:07] came it sealed the first coming and it
[53:11] opened the second coming to make you and
[53:14] I ready and that's why Paul said we are
[53:17] longing and looking for the coming of
[53:21] the Lord
[53:23] that's our desire is his coming
[53:29] that's why in every service that's why
[53:31] every moment of our life we should
[53:33] expect his coming can I bring it down
[53:35] personal Lord I've got this situation on
[53:38] the job we should look for his coming
[53:41] Lord I've got this in school look for
[53:44] his coming Lord this issue is going on
[53:46] in the family or this or that look for
[53:49] his coming
[53:51] say brother Samuel what does that to do
[53:53] you're missing it I'm talking about him
[53:55] who is the answer to all things he that
[53:59] is the dissolver of every doubt we are
[54:01] people of the coming and we should
[54:03] expect his coming
[54:05] that's why every service it should be
[54:08] with an expectation do you realize what
[54:11] makes the service the service is your
[54:13] expectation
[54:16] right
[54:18] they call Satan if he can come and bug
[54:19] you and get on you and cause you to say
[54:22] this or do this or whatever more then he
[54:24] would like to put that old gloomy Spirit
[54:26] over you and tell you why you are not
[54:28] worthy to receive from God but let me
[54:30] tell you something you're just a moment
[54:32] away from where there is repentance to
[54:35] say Lord forgive me o God
[54:38] because I know what Satan's trying to do
[54:41] he's trying to keep me back from a
[54:43] blessing
[54:44] are you hearing me that's part of
[54:46] maturity maturity isn't oh I don't have
[54:49] any more of those blunders maturity is
[54:51] is to recognize oh this was said I
[54:54] shouldn't have said that repent because
[54:56] he is on the way with a blessing for my
[54:59] life
[55:00] hope it don't stumble you
[55:02] you might just be getting off of your
[55:04] knees from repenting and your atoms are
[55:06] changed
[55:08] because remember he still got on the
[55:11] garments
[55:12] of the priest
[55:15] Hallelujah and when he changes his
[55:17] garments we get a change of garments
[55:20] also and until that time we need him to
[55:24] be a high priest
[55:29] glory be to God whose heart is set on
[55:33] pilgrimage
[55:35] this this man's strength is his the life
[55:39] that is there wherein that God is the
[55:43] very strength of his life
[55:47] and he is like we looked at it last week
[55:50] he is our source within that we draw
[55:54] strength from in our lives
[55:56] you know it's one thing to draw strength
[55:58] from one another and I believe that
[56:00] that's necessary
[56:01] you know I I don't believe any of this
[56:04] you know Pride where you know it's well
[56:06] you know I don't need nobody I got the
[56:07] Holy Ghost and I don't need nobody
[56:10] they're going to be something come to
[56:12] deflate you
[56:15] now I don't say that to be negative
[56:18] because many times I don't even try to
[56:20] wrestle that when I've heard other
[56:21] people before well my faith keeps
[56:23] sickness away from me what do you do
[56:25] brother Samuel well I'll tell you what
[56:26] I've done I just pray
[56:28] God give them Grace because they're
[56:29] going to need
[56:31] they're going to need that because we're
[56:33] still in these bodies right here
[56:36] we're still in all of that and and thank
[56:38] God for Faith right but there's also
[56:41] faith that comes that you and I have to
[56:44] be able to go through something
[56:46] I mean what if you never went through
[56:48] anything
[56:49] why would you want to leave
[56:53] hello somebody
[56:54] God has to allow things to come about
[56:57] that causes us to want to leave
[57:00] oh boy we'll preach
[57:03] God has to allow things in our life that
[57:06] we desire to leave where we are at
[57:10] presently in our own lives
[57:14] not just waiting for the change of our
[57:16] body but God and what God's trying to do
[57:19] call us out of us
[57:22] because then the one that's the biggest
[57:24] enemy of our life is the guy that we gal
[57:27] that we look at the look in the mirror
[57:29] every day
[57:30] that's our biggest enemy oh no no no no
[57:33] if so-and-so didn't push my buttons
[57:35] remember you got buttons to push
[57:37] and the change of the body is also to do
[57:39] away with those buttons as much as it is
[57:41] for what they push your buttons with are
[57:43] you hearing me so in the meantime in the
[57:45] meantime we are here under the molding
[57:48] and the shaping of almighty God and we
[57:51] receive strength from him
[57:56] so we do we do receive strength also
[57:59] from one another but it isn't it isn't
[58:02] just uh human strength
[58:06] right
[58:08] right it's strength that comes from the
[58:10] Lord
[58:11] that's what Paul could talk about that
[58:14] we comfort those who are in the midst of
[58:17] a trial by the same Comfort we are
[58:19] comforted with
[58:20] he is also we looked at this he's our
[58:22] saving strength
[58:25] he's our saving strength he comes to our
[58:28] rescue
[58:29] but the way we think of rescue sometimes
[58:32] is not altogether how God does it God
[58:35] doesn't come to our rescue and here we
[58:37] are in the midst of everything and God
[58:38] says let me take you out of that and
[58:40] I'll put you over here that's not rescue
[58:44] the rescue is God rescuing us from our
[58:47] own selves
[58:52] it's God's way of rescue
[58:54] the Bible tells us in regarding this of
[58:57] Joseph in the book of Acts it speaks of
[59:00] how in the book of Acts
[59:02] that God was with him
[59:05] and God delivered him
[59:09] but God delivered him into every
[59:11] appointment that God had for him
[59:14] the greatest Deliverance that we we can
[59:17] have is deliverance from ourselves
[59:20] it contains
[59:22] themselves right
[59:25] so blessed is that man
[59:27] and who's who finds his strength in God
[59:30] his heart is set on pilgrimage he's not
[59:32] relying upon the world for strength he's
[59:35] he and he considers himself a visitor a
[59:37] traveler
[59:38] it's just one who's passing through let
[59:41] me just try to jump into this just for a
[59:43] few moments tonight who passing through
[59:45] the Valley of Baca make it a well and
[59:49] the rain also filleth
[59:51] the polls
[59:52] just in study here and over the past
[59:55] time of looking at this
[59:57] many of the even of the writers and so
[59:59] forth do not have this pin down as far
[1:00:01] as an actual physical point on the map
[1:00:07] but it is figurative if we can because
[1:00:09] even whether if it was a point or not
[1:00:11] it's still figurative and
[1:00:13] any that it's applied to our life that
[1:00:15] how a man has strengthened God and His
[1:00:18] desire is the house of God his heart is
[1:00:22] set on pilgrimage in other words
[1:00:24] this world is not my home
[1:00:28] I'm just passing through and there is
[1:00:31] the need who passing through not coming
[1:00:34] to dwell in the valley
[1:00:37] we're not made to dwell in the valley we
[1:00:40] are inhabitants of Mount Zion
[1:00:44] we are the inhabitants of Mount Zion
[1:00:47] when it speaks of the Bride we are
[1:00:50] elevated not by our own works we are
[1:00:53] elevated through the perfect cleansing
[1:00:56] Redemptive work of Jesus Christ we are
[1:01:00] elevated into position as his pride
[1:01:04] glory be to God so our position is not
[1:01:09] the valley but the valley is necessary
[1:01:13] it's necessary as we're coming and we
[1:01:16] live in the valley we live from the
[1:01:19] strength of him who has positioned us as
[1:01:23] Mount Zion
[1:01:26] you see we're like that that young man
[1:01:28] who was working in the field and they
[1:01:30] said what do you do with him
[1:01:32] well he gets everything his way
[1:01:34] everything goes how he wants it to go
[1:01:36] everything's perfect he
[1:01:38] that don't happen that way that's not
[1:01:40] why he was acting the way he was acting
[1:01:43] he still had to eat the same things that
[1:01:45] they had to eat he had to work the same
[1:01:47] way they had to work what is it that's
[1:01:50] different about this boy
[1:01:54] what was different
[1:01:55] it's what he knew in another land my
[1:02:00] daddy is the king
[1:02:01] he's the king that makes me the son of a
[1:02:04] king so that reality affected his
[1:02:09] conduct in the midst of what was going
[1:02:11] on
[1:02:13] That's The Power of divine revelation
[1:02:15] are you hearing me divine revelation has
[1:02:18] a power in it because it works to affect
[1:02:21] our lives the way we act the way we
[1:02:23] behave
[1:02:27] so the valley itself it's a place in the
[1:02:30] journey now notice just even from the
[1:02:32] scripture here
[1:02:34] it's a place a valley
[1:02:36] we know it's a place that lays between
[1:02:38] mountains
[1:02:42] it's a place that we know that if you
[1:02:45] look in the scripture it's wonderful
[1:02:47] wonderful wonderful victories that were
[1:02:50] rocked in valleys
[1:02:52] it was also in the valley that there was
[1:02:55] an Army that challenged God
[1:02:59] and said he's God of the mountain but he
[1:03:02] ain't god of the valley
[1:03:04] God said I'll take that challenge up
[1:03:07] I let him know that the same gun on the
[1:03:09] mountain is the same God in the valley
[1:03:13] oh we ought to just take that and run it
[1:03:16] right back in the devil's face you've
[1:03:18] already sung a special to him you ought
[1:03:20] to put it right back in his face God is
[1:03:23] still here no matter how I feel what
[1:03:26] circumstance look like God is still
[1:03:29] presence
[1:03:30] [Applause]
[1:03:33] this part of the journey reminded that
[1:03:37] it was from the valley of Esco where
[1:03:40] Caleb and Joshua brought grapes from
[1:03:43] not from the mountain from the valley
[1:03:47] because fruit don't grow in the
[1:03:49] mountaintops fruit grows in the valley
[1:03:52] right
[1:03:54] so to many precious Promises of the
[1:03:56] valley and things that take place God
[1:03:58] does many things in the back let me just
[1:04:00] say it like this you realize it was in
[1:04:02] the valley
[1:04:05] that Goliath met his end
[1:04:10] he wasn't on a Mountaintop it
[1:04:15] would despise The Valleys
[1:04:19] because it's in the valley where we've
[1:04:21] seen those greats God Vindicated his
[1:04:24] word
[1:04:26] when challenge came with Goliath God
[1:04:29] Vindicated his anointing that had
[1:04:32] returned to Israel he Vindicated it by
[1:04:35] bringing Goliath down and made him he
[1:04:38] made him not fall on his path he made
[1:04:40] him fall on his face every word that he
[1:04:43] ever said and he cursed the armies of
[1:04:45] Israel God said I'll make you bow on
[1:04:48] your face
[1:04:50] hey man
[1:04:52] what should I do I tell you what I do I
[1:04:55] get ready for a chance to start falling
[1:04:57] in the valley
[1:04:59] I forgot to start showing up with grapes
[1:05:03] in the valley you see it's how we looked
[1:05:06] at the valley
[1:05:07] [Music]
[1:05:09] think of what brother country said when
[1:05:11] he was here which we know is very very
[1:05:12] true think of what he said when he dealt
[1:05:15] with just in the part about tragedy and
[1:05:17] purpose and he said many of the times
[1:05:19] the reason we stay as long as we do it's
[1:05:22] our attitude
[1:05:27] help me preach somebody now we went from
[1:05:30] shouting to getting quiet but let's
[1:05:31] we're here to be helped
[1:05:33] I don't want to dwell in the valley no
[1:05:35] longer I'm supposed to be here because
[1:05:37] I'm just supposed to be passing through
[1:05:39] in other words I'm not setting up
[1:05:40] homekeeping here in the valley
[1:05:42] the valley is just just a point along
[1:05:44] the way
[1:05:45] where am I going I'm going back to where
[1:05:47] I come from
[1:05:49] I've got an appointment when the Rapture
[1:05:51] I've got I've got a I've got a place in
[1:05:54] the Millennium I've got a place at the
[1:05:56] wedding supper place in the Millennium I
[1:05:58] got a place at the future home I have
[1:06:01] appointments better to be kept
[1:06:05] and that is worth more than anything of
[1:06:10] this life
[1:06:11] nothing in this life is worth missing
[1:06:15] the Rapture form
[1:06:17] you say bring it down personal a funny
[1:06:20] feeling it's not worth missing the
[1:06:22] Rapture for
[1:06:23] come on somebody anger and lack of
[1:06:26] forgiveness and bitterness is not worth
[1:06:28] missing the Rapture talk
[1:06:33] we're just passing through foreign
[1:06:36] be to God but in this Valley
[1:06:40] this Valley it definitely infers
[1:06:44] that in this Valley is heaviness
[1:06:49] in this Valley is weeping
[1:06:51] now you hear me now
[1:06:53] in this Valley is distress
[1:06:58] and it's only a place
[1:07:03] only a place that we pass through
[1:07:08] Maybe now there have been some places
[1:07:10] that I've passed through on trips
[1:07:15] that I don't care if I never Pastor them
[1:07:16] again
[1:07:21] I'm just being honest some places to me
[1:07:24] in my opinion ugly I don't care if I
[1:07:26] ever pass through there again
[1:07:31] some places wow you can see certain
[1:07:34] effects and things like that that's all
[1:07:36] around
[1:07:37] but then there's other places that you
[1:07:38] look back and you think man
[1:07:40] I sure like to go through there again
[1:07:42] maybe if we can kind of you know take
[1:07:44] the trip out and kind of go through
[1:07:47] the leaves are nice and pretty right now
[1:07:49] and you don't mind going through that
[1:07:51] you know because it's it's somewhere we
[1:07:53] like to go through
[1:07:54] but these valleys are not places that
[1:07:58] anybody signs up for
[1:07:59] matter of fact this Valley is not on the
[1:08:02] tourist list
[1:08:03] this Valley does not have a resort that
[1:08:05] it's booked out no but this Valley is
[1:08:09] predestined appointments for everyone of
[1:08:14] God's children
[1:08:16] but let me just say this to you no more
[1:08:18] than staying at a hotel as your
[1:08:19] permanent residence no that's the same
[1:08:21] way it is with the valley of baka you
[1:08:24] check in and you check out I'm just
[1:08:27] passing through
[1:08:30] that's why this world's not my home I'm
[1:08:32] not I'm not of this world I'm of that
[1:08:35] other world
[1:08:36] [Applause]
[1:08:39] so there's a destiny
[1:08:41] and we we realize that with that this is
[1:08:45] why we want to be very important to
[1:08:47] notice whose heart is set on pilgrimage
[1:08:49] and who passing through the Valley of
[1:08:53] Baca what we want to make sure is if you
[1:08:56] can look and you find yourself in a
[1:09:00] valley of weeping distress or heaviness
[1:09:03] or sickness oppression or somebody said
[1:09:06] something about you or them just make
[1:09:09] sure
[1:09:10] look real quick and say which way are my
[1:09:14] feet pointed
[1:09:17] when I've come to this have I went to
[1:09:20] turn around to go back
[1:09:24] because we're challenged with that
[1:09:27] am I going to go back because you know
[1:09:29] what Satan's deal is I'll let off the
[1:09:32] heat if you'll just
[1:09:34] take your foot off the gas a little bit
[1:09:38] I take the heat off of
[1:09:42] her she just never brought me do
[1:09:43] anything but trouble and trials and look
[1:09:45] what it's done with your family I beg to
[1:09:47] differ with that liar
[1:09:49] it's been the greatest blessing and
[1:09:52] privilege of my life
[1:09:55] because this message is not a movement
[1:09:59] it's Jesus Christ being revealed then
[1:10:02] give me a little bit more right here I
[1:10:04] don't want to lose my voice
[1:10:04] [Applause]
[1:10:07] I hope it's okay I lost my Lawson was a
[1:10:09] miracle that I preached on Sunday
[1:10:10] morning God totally restored it I didn't
[1:10:12] have monitors down there and I've got to
[1:10:14] have monitors
[1:10:16] oh brother Sammy you don't know you're
[1:10:17] not a preacher so you wouldn't know
[1:10:24] but anyhow beast and
[1:10:27] the pilgrimage that we're on
[1:10:29] make sure what direction your feet are
[1:10:32] on
[1:10:34] let me tell you the worst thing to do in
[1:10:37] the midst of a trial is pull back on God
[1:10:40] can I just be very Frank if when a trial
[1:10:44] comes because they are going to come if
[1:10:47] when a trial comes you find yourself
[1:10:49] going away from God going right back out
[1:10:52] in the world then you need to ask God
[1:10:55] give me a deeper experience I need a
[1:11:00] strength in my life that goes beyond my
[1:11:02] mental acknowledgment of truth I need an
[1:11:06] anchor
[1:11:10] Hallelujah because the trial is not
[1:11:14] greater than God's strength in your life
[1:11:17] and I don't say that to shame you that
[1:11:21] should be a test in our lives
[1:11:25] turn it down just a little bit if when
[1:11:27] things are coming out
[1:11:28] I go out oh by the same I don't go back
[1:11:31] on the world but you lay out of church
[1:11:33] for how long
[1:11:34] amen
[1:11:35] oh well I'm just going through a trial
[1:11:38] who isn't
[1:11:39] who isn't
[1:11:41] oh you're not going through a trial like
[1:11:43] I am how do you know
[1:11:45] remember trials are peculiar and
[1:11:48] particular to each one
[1:11:52] are you hearing me that's why we're not
[1:11:54] called I'm just going to preach straight
[1:11:56] to this coming that's why we are not
[1:11:57] called we sympathize empathize with one
[1:12:00] another but we recognize that God
[1:12:04] strengthens you and I he comes to
[1:12:07] strengthen us
[1:12:12] throughout this building right here
[1:12:15] there's hearts and lives that no matter
[1:12:17] what is taking place even some maybe
[1:12:19] that are not even here and on and on
[1:12:21] that even in the midst of the toughest
[1:12:23] of trial
[1:12:24] you say well it ain't just about being a
[1:12:26] church it's about being in the house of
[1:12:28] God and serving God
[1:12:31] let me just say this if the world still
[1:12:34] holds an appeal you need a birth
[1:12:37] [Applause]
[1:12:39] say it with the love of God in my heart
[1:12:41] because that is what's going to get you
[1:12:43] out of here that's what will get you
[1:12:45] through every test and every trial
[1:12:51] oh God help us
[1:12:54] you got to be sure which way is your
[1:12:56] pilgrimage heading is it heading toward
[1:12:59] God or away from God
[1:13:03] Paul would even admonish
[1:13:06] the people of God he would send the
[1:13:08] disciples in Acts 14 21.
[1:13:12] the Bible said when they had preached
[1:13:13] the gospel to the city and had taught
[1:13:14] many then returned again to last her
[1:13:16] into Iconium and Antioch confirming the
[1:13:19] souls of the disciples
[1:13:21] and exhorting them
[1:13:23] to continue in the faith and that we
[1:13:26] must through much tribulation enter into
[1:13:30] the kingdom of God
[1:13:32] this is not a picnic
[1:13:36] this is a journey
[1:13:38] are you with me and the valley of baka
[1:13:41] is a personal personal appointment for
[1:13:46] my life
[1:13:47] it's personal for your life
[1:13:51] and hope you understand this
[1:13:53] this Valley there'll be many valleys
[1:13:57] there's many valleys of baka
[1:14:00] along the journey
[1:14:02] because God's got a purpose in the midst
[1:14:05] of this Valley
[1:14:06] god brother Branham would say it in the
[1:14:07] message I know
[1:14:09] he said why do we come to these troubles
[1:14:11] what makes these things come
[1:14:13] why should a Christian ever be perplexed
[1:14:16] why wouldn't not everything just run
[1:14:19] perfect for a Christian but it doesn't
[1:14:21] and we know it sometimes we have more
[1:14:24] troubles when we become a Christian than
[1:14:27] we did when we were sinners
[1:14:28] because it's written many is the
[1:14:31] afflictions of the righteous but God
[1:14:34] delivereth him from them all
[1:14:38] God promised oh my let me just rehearse
[1:14:41] this God promised many afflictions
[1:14:46] strange feeling any better had strange
[1:14:48] feelings
[1:14:49] sure have and strange things that would
[1:14:52] be beyond our understanding
[1:14:57] what God promised I know those are not
[1:15:00] things that are rehearsed those are not
[1:15:03] things that books are written on but
[1:15:05] that is the word of God
[1:15:07] this is all part of our journey God
[1:15:10] promptly with that promise
[1:15:12] he said I'll deliver you out of every
[1:15:14] one of them
[1:15:16] that's what he did say so when I flip
[1:15:24] a flee getting out of the fire but
[1:15:25] Deliverance is is God saying I have
[1:15:28] arranged this so that I can meet you
[1:15:29] personally here in the midst of the fire
[1:15:33] glory be to God but Lord what about all
[1:15:35] these lines don't worry about the lines
[1:15:37] I'm the ones who I'm the one who created
[1:15:39] them
[1:15:40] oh I know they're bigger than the you
[1:15:43] know than your tabby cat and whatever
[1:15:44] more but they ain't only but kitty cats
[1:15:46] once they're once under my presence and
[1:15:48] under my control
[1:15:49] and they won't touch you
[1:15:52] in order to be to God but it's always
[1:15:54] done for our good we just can't
[1:15:56] understand it because if we did then it
[1:15:59] would not be Faith to us we would go
[1:16:03] with an understanding now I want to pick
[1:16:04] that up here in just a little bit if we
[1:16:07] understood it
[1:16:08] if we did but we don't then it would not
[1:16:11] be Faith to us so Faith itself is not me
[1:16:14] understanding the trial but faith is an
[1:16:17] understanding that God has everything in
[1:16:20] control
[1:16:20] that God is working it out and I am
[1:16:23] going to hold to God's unchanging hand
[1:16:25] we do it we believe by faith his word
[1:16:28] that it's going to work something good
[1:16:29] for us if we could grasp that today if
[1:16:32] we could grasp that all our troubles
[1:16:34] there is none of us immune from them and
[1:16:36] we could realize that those things are
[1:16:38] for our good
[1:16:41] how brother Brown would go on to say
[1:16:43] after he says we become his property our
[1:16:45] confession and our baptism and our
[1:16:47] promise to walk in life for him then
[1:16:49] every trial that comes upon us
[1:16:51] is to perfect us for his glory it's to
[1:16:55] bring us to a place where God can make
[1:16:57] himself more real to us than he was
[1:16:59] before the trial come
[1:17:04] I referred you to a scripture last week
[1:17:06] out of First Peter chapter one a very
[1:17:08] common scripture especially when we talk
[1:17:10] about tests and trials and and the first
[1:17:13] couple verses speaks of
[1:17:15] The Inheritance that we have waiting on
[1:17:18] us a body that is not prepared with
[1:17:22] hands and we have that Assurance in our
[1:17:25] hearts we draw strength from Before the
[1:17:29] Throne of God down into this life that
[1:17:32] we're living
[1:17:34] in verse 6 it says wherein ye greatly
[1:17:37] Rejoice though now for a season if need
[1:17:41] be ye are in heaviness through manifold
[1:17:45] Temptations
[1:17:47] if need be now I'm sure that every one
[1:17:50] of us if we had to we would tell God I
[1:17:52] don't need that Lord
[1:17:53] I don't need that you know just like
[1:17:56] your kids would tell you I don't need
[1:17:57] that yeah yeah I got that yeah yeah you
[1:18:00] know they know where you're going yeah
[1:18:01] yeah yeah yeah I don't need that but God
[1:18:04] knows what we need
[1:18:07] let me tell you something God will use
[1:18:08] circumstances friends
[1:18:11] when we speak of this within trials
[1:18:14] and I hope I can get to this point of it
[1:18:16] here tonight
[1:18:17] that when we look at the testings and
[1:18:20] the trials that come up on our life
[1:18:23] it's not always correction
[1:18:25] whereas that we've done something wrong
[1:18:29] God will also at times allow things to
[1:18:32] get our attention
[1:18:34] you understand God will allow things to
[1:18:37] get our attention that maybe if maybe if
[1:18:39] we're straddling the fence and we just
[1:18:41] kind of back and forth God will allow a
[1:18:43] situation to get our attention something
[1:18:46] to come up
[1:18:48] you know what to cause us to realize
[1:18:51] where am I at
[1:18:54] where am I at
[1:18:55] you see if a situation goes by and
[1:18:58] there's no reflection here
[1:19:02] maybe for you that was a waste but for
[1:19:04] somebody it wasn't
[1:19:06] are you hearing me that's why when
[1:19:07] things come around we must learn from it
[1:19:10] and say God help me to learn what is it
[1:19:13] that you're trying to teach me
[1:19:15] and don't give him a bunch of words that
[1:19:17] this is what you're trying to do you
[1:19:19] don't understand it
[1:19:21] right you don't understand it I don't
[1:19:24] understand it but that's where faith
[1:19:26] comes in in our life
[1:19:32] oh
[1:19:33] my goodness Pastor back in town any
[1:19:38] wherein we greatly rejoice
[1:19:40] what are we rejoicing in in that
[1:19:44] article for Yonder
[1:19:47] so my joy is about where I'm going
[1:19:51] my joy is not about what I'm going
[1:19:54] through
[1:19:55] it's not what I'm glaring in what I'm
[1:19:58] glaring in is that I know that this
[1:20:00] trial cannot take me it's only going to
[1:20:03] move me and shape me but there's nothing
[1:20:05] that can affect or deter my destiny I
[1:20:09] have been sealed until the day of
[1:20:12] redemption so in the midst of my trial I
[1:20:15] can Joy I can thank God not because the
[1:20:18] trial is good
[1:20:20] but because I know
[1:20:22] where I'm going
[1:20:27] we are in heaviness
[1:20:30] through manifold Temptation so this is
[1:20:32] not the valley of baka it's not a a a
[1:20:35] choice destination it's a place of
[1:20:38] heaviness why that the trial of your
[1:20:41] faith
[1:20:44] being much more precious than of gold
[1:20:46] that perisheth though it be tried with
[1:20:48] fire might be found unto praise and
[1:20:50] honor and Glory at the appearing of
[1:20:52] Jesus Christ so what's on trial here
[1:20:55] our faith
[1:20:58] God's Not trying God is not wondering
[1:21:01] where is your faith at
[1:21:03] but God knows where our faith is at
[1:21:06] I hope you understand this God knows God
[1:21:09] knows if our faith is only here
[1:21:11] he knows if it's here
[1:21:12] and the trial itself
[1:21:15] will unfold that
[1:21:19] and what's what's more precious than
[1:21:21] gold not the trial
[1:21:23] but our faith
[1:21:24] because the gold of this Earth it
[1:21:27] belongs to the one whose faith I have
[1:21:30] been born of
[1:21:31] right true he does the deity is not in
[1:21:36] heaven it's in you
[1:21:38] the earth and the fullness thereof
[1:21:40] Belongs to the Lord
[1:21:43] it's his faith in my life that has
[1:21:46] brought my faith to a level that's not
[1:21:49] just intellectual
[1:21:52] are you with me it's his faith
[1:21:54] motivating our faith you understand what
[1:21:56] I'm saying his faith is the baptism of
[1:21:59] the Holy Ghost the life I'll now live I
[1:22:01] live by the faith of the Son of God who
[1:22:04] loved me and gave himself for me and
[1:22:07] that Faith moving in our life it affects
[1:22:10] our faith
[1:22:12] and God will turn around in the church
[1:22:15] ages and reward the Believers I have
[1:22:18] seen your faith and brother Graham said
[1:22:20] see he weren't talking about his faith
[1:22:22] in that scripture he's talking about
[1:22:24] their faith oh God I want my faith to be
[1:22:27] affected by his faith I want my
[1:22:32] but it actually displays
[1:22:35] please oh glory be to God
[1:22:37] look at this here in the scripture we
[1:22:39] find with this as we look at it at Peter
[1:22:42] it's bringing this about then we realize
[1:22:45] that as all of this comes about in verse
[1:22:48] 9 we are going to receive the end the
[1:22:52] completion the culmination of our faith
[1:22:54] even the salvation of our souls
[1:22:57] oh glory be to God so this this Valley
[1:23:00] I'm just passing through
[1:23:02] you hear me I'm just passing through so
[1:23:05] these trials
[1:23:06] they're a natural normal part of
[1:23:09] Christian Life
[1:23:11] that's the words of the prophet they are
[1:23:14] a natural normal part of Christian life
[1:23:18] now let me just say it like this let me
[1:23:20] let me read this here and I think this
[1:23:22] will kind of let me let me just kind of
[1:23:23] hone in on this part of it here tonight
[1:23:25] to try to get this tied up
[1:23:29] brother Batman refers to this in three
[1:23:31] kinds of believers
[1:23:34] and he says the Believers we are put to
[1:23:37] the test
[1:23:39] and he said remember trials and Dusty
[1:23:42] roads and hot son of persecution
[1:23:45] but it's the Loyalty of your heart that
[1:23:48] beats that material until she's ready to
[1:23:50] go into the mold
[1:23:51] so all of those
[1:23:54] things that are a part of the valley of
[1:23:57] weeping
[1:23:59] but it's the heart
[1:24:01] taking a hold on God's word and say Lord
[1:24:04] this is what you've promised
[1:24:06] and as we're standing there upon that
[1:24:09] word
[1:24:10] weeping
[1:24:12] in heaviness
[1:24:15] crying out to God
[1:24:20] what is it that's beating
[1:24:22] Our Lives what is it that's molding that
[1:24:25] character
[1:24:26] our heart
[1:24:27] is stayed on God blessed is the man
[1:24:31] whose heart
[1:24:33] his strength is in the Lord his heart is
[1:24:37] set on pilgrimage
[1:24:41] in reality this man can't give up
[1:24:44] you know why
[1:24:46] because he never did start what was in
[1:24:48] his life
[1:24:50] right oh I gave my life to God one day
[1:24:53] no God got a hold of your life
[1:24:55] don't try to take any glory in it God
[1:24:57] got a hold of your life
[1:25:00] hallelujah oh one day I went to the
[1:25:02] altar no God moved upon your heart and
[1:25:05] God Drew you
[1:25:06] no glory of our own this is not my work
[1:25:10] it's God's word
[1:25:12] we are his workmanship
[1:25:16] [Applause]
[1:25:19] Hallelujah so I didn't start it I'm not
[1:25:22] the one to finish it but I'm Anointed
[1:25:24] with the same one who started it I'm
[1:25:27] Anointed with the finishing anointing
[1:25:30] because I'm living in the finishing age
[1:25:35] and the Holy Spirit that has anointed me
[1:25:39] is the one who has come to take the
[1:25:42] seals off of the book and I've been
[1:25:44] anointed to finish this
[1:25:47] [Applause]
[1:25:49] [Music]
[1:25:52] glory be to God
[1:25:55] oh I'm going to fall you rebuke that
[1:25:57] devil no you're not
[1:26:02] oh there'll be something down the road
[1:26:04] now right here I am where I am by the
[1:26:06] grace of God and what I got in need of
[1:26:09] was what lays down the road God will
[1:26:11] prepare me for that moment
[1:26:14] and just listen up devil that moment is
[1:26:17] not to destroy me yes that moment is not
[1:26:21] to consume me I'm just passing through
[1:26:28] I'm not going to take up residence with
[1:26:30] you
[1:26:37] you realize sometimes friends
[1:26:39] we can take up residence on things so
[1:26:42] and so talked about me so and so said
[1:26:44] this do you realize that that's
[1:26:47] permitted to be a valley of baka
[1:26:51] I can pull out a Litany of quotes
[1:26:52] tonight and scriptures on that if you'd
[1:26:54] like
[1:26:55] but sometimes we're looking oh brother
[1:26:56] William I tell you bless God if he'd be
[1:26:59] if he was more of a real believer I tell
[1:27:02] you oh man he said this about I'll tell
[1:27:04] you if he really had the goods if he and
[1:27:06] God said
[1:27:12] you're not just green behind the ears
[1:27:13] Samuel you're green all over boy
[1:27:18] you know why because we're always
[1:27:20] looking at ready if so and so I had done
[1:27:21] this so-and-so hurt me so-and-so said
[1:27:23] this so-and-so said that you know the
[1:27:25] sad thing about it is some folks have
[1:27:27] taken up residency in the valley of baka
[1:27:31] and the trial is bitter are you hearing
[1:27:34] me now the trial is bitter it's weary
[1:27:38] but God never made you to be a bitter
[1:27:40] Christian
[1:27:41] the circumstance around you I can read
[1:27:43] scriptures here tonight where the
[1:27:45] circumstance is bitter but God never
[1:27:48] ordained you to become a receptacle of
[1:27:51] bitterness and anger and resentment God
[1:27:54] never ordained that
[1:27:56] you need to put your notice in tonight
[1:27:58] I'm checking out of the valley of baka
[1:28:02] because the valley of baka God wants to
[1:28:06] do things in the valley
[1:28:08] and he can only do it
[1:28:11] when we allow patience
[1:28:13] to have her
[1:28:16] not his the bride submits let her
[1:28:20] perfect work
[1:28:24] I agree with Mr Patsy Lord help me
[1:28:28] [Applause]
[1:28:30] I love that Honesty because we argue and
[1:28:31] we all Lord help me Lord help me
[1:28:34] we need it because this Valley listen
[1:28:36] friends these are things tonight when
[1:28:39] the Holy Spirit would press Upon Our
[1:28:40] Hearts this is words of encouragement
[1:28:42] for you and I you know what it does
[1:28:44] sometimes it doesn't necessarily
[1:28:46] dissolve or resolve the issue but it
[1:28:48] lets you know that Satan's trying to
[1:28:50] hinder me
[1:28:52] he's come right into a test or a trial
[1:28:55] and he's come to hinder me
[1:28:57] right it's like somebody experiences a
[1:28:59] car accident
[1:29:00] and because they experience a car
[1:29:02] accident maybe they're driving along the
[1:29:04] road and so forth and they experience a
[1:29:05] car accident then Satan's desire would
[1:29:07] say hmm not only do they got to pay the
[1:29:11] insurances and all these bills but you
[1:29:12] know what I think I'll do while in this
[1:29:14] vulnerable part right here I'll slip in
[1:29:16] with fear
[1:29:17] to where they won't want to get behind a
[1:29:19] car again
[1:29:22] over the center that's not a big deal
[1:29:24] well no Satan is an opportunist
[1:29:27] Satan would love remember in the midst
[1:29:29] of the valley he came at job in every
[1:29:31] angle
[1:29:33] is that right
[1:29:35] oh but I'm so glad that God is our
[1:29:37] deliverer
[1:29:38] I'm glad about that tonight aren't you
[1:29:39] I'm glad that God don't sit down and say
[1:29:42] oh why do you have that attitude in the
[1:29:44] valley but I'm glad that God when he
[1:29:45] begins to speak and we can say yes Lord
[1:29:47] we begin to experience the Liberty as
[1:29:50] Satan's cover is taken off and we can
[1:29:53] say yes Lord yes Lord thank you Lord
[1:29:56] what's happening now we're getting
[1:29:59] ourselves in a position to receive what
[1:30:03] we need in the valley
[1:30:05] because in the valley he maketh it a
[1:30:09] well
[1:30:09] he reigneth down blessings that filleth
[1:30:13] the pools places that are ordained to
[1:30:18] receive refreshment
[1:30:21] and he ordains that for our lives
[1:30:25] God's children
[1:30:27] oh my
[1:30:29] God's children is made up correctly on
[1:30:31] his word
[1:30:32] they're living examples and the word of
[1:30:34] God living through them
[1:30:36] the trial comes to shake you
[1:30:39] to put you to the very bottom to see
[1:30:42] where you'll stand
[1:30:45] tested
[1:30:47] and tried
[1:30:48] now let me just can I have just a couple
[1:30:50] more minutes
[1:30:52] I'm only going to take just a couple
[1:30:54] more minutes here on this I know that's
[1:30:55] dangerous but
[1:30:59] for job
[1:31:01] the test and the trials came and then he
[1:31:04] had
[1:31:05] those
[1:31:07] friends of his and they were friends
[1:31:10] they were friends
[1:31:12] they looked upon job and they sat there
[1:31:14] for seven days the Bible says and they
[1:31:16] saw the grief
[1:31:19] now the Bible when he speaks of the
[1:31:20] grief it says that they could see
[1:31:22] physically
[1:31:24] and mentally
[1:31:25] the effect
[1:31:27] upon his life one of the wisest things
[1:31:29] those seven friends could do
[1:31:32] were those three friends sitting there
[1:31:34] for seven days and not saying a word
[1:31:36] that was the best thing
[1:31:38] right right I mean you you and I had
[1:31:41] people that said dumb things sometimes
[1:31:43] oh I understand do you really
[1:31:46] you you walk through this way
[1:31:48] I forgive me if that offend you I don't
[1:31:50] mean to offend you but you understand
[1:31:51] what I'm saying sometimes you just take
[1:31:52] it you know for that hey they don't okay
[1:31:54] we don't I'm not going to put up roads
[1:31:56] about that you know
[1:31:57] hello
[1:31:59] not gonna put up their picture as how
[1:32:01] they say foolish things no that's
[1:32:02] sometimes people say things when they
[1:32:05] don't know what else to say they get
[1:32:07] nervous
[1:32:08] and they just say something right so we
[1:32:11] don't fault them for that but we
[1:32:12] understand even with that right there
[1:32:15] what are we going to do we're going to
[1:32:16] cop an attitude
[1:32:18] hello
[1:32:19] we're gonna cop an attitude with them
[1:32:21] well if you really knew what I knew
[1:32:25] I don't know think I want to know
[1:32:29] maybe maybe I need to get my my plasmat
[1:32:32] suit or hazmat suit and yellow suit okay
[1:32:34] come on and tell me what it is
[1:32:40] Sammy what what are you saying I'm
[1:32:43] saying it's important that we don't
[1:32:45] become Valley dwellers
[1:32:47] we're just passing through
[1:32:50] we're just passing through
[1:32:52] bitterness is not a result of the valley
[1:32:57] a product
[1:32:58] bitterness can be a condition of the
[1:33:01] valley but it's not a product
[1:33:03] that we receive from God at all
[1:33:08] I want you to think of this
[1:33:10] he know job knowed that he had met God's
[1:33:13] requirements
[1:33:14] and there was no need of Satan trying to
[1:33:16] tempt him he knowed it was the devil and
[1:33:19] as long Satan can make him believe that
[1:33:21] his sickness was his God doing it
[1:33:25] he had job whip
[1:33:30] are you hearing me
[1:33:31] as long as Satan could make job think
[1:33:36] now Satan could not make Job Curse God
[1:33:41] but he was
[1:33:43] making him think
[1:33:46] it was God doing it
[1:33:51] now he knew it was Satan doing it but
[1:33:53] Satan was making him think it was his
[1:33:56] God doing it now let me just read on
[1:33:59] here just a moment
[1:34:00] but he said when that Revelation struck
[1:34:02] job that it was not God he was only
[1:34:04] going through his trials to make him
[1:34:06] something
[1:34:08] did you catch that
[1:34:10] only going through
[1:34:12] to make him something
[1:34:14] only passing through the valley
[1:34:17] to make us something
[1:34:19] it wasn't God doing it it was Satan
[1:34:22] doing it
[1:34:24] and he said he'll try to tell you that
[1:34:26] these trials this is your God trying to
[1:34:28] put punishment upon you
[1:34:31] it isn't
[1:34:33] so
[1:34:35] it's Satan doing it and God permitting
[1:34:38] it to temper you
[1:34:40] to make you see if you are tied to this
[1:34:44] Earth by the cares of it or whether
[1:34:47] you're treasure
[1:34:49] is in heaven
[1:34:57] you read through the Book of Job
[1:35:01] as a Bible reader
[1:35:04] you come into the second chapter
[1:35:07] and job right there
[1:35:09] he's already in the Valley of Baca
[1:35:13] but these are statements
[1:35:16] while passing through
[1:35:18] for the circumstance that he was in and
[1:35:21] the situation
[1:35:23] oh I wish the day had never come
[1:35:27] that they said a man child was born
[1:35:31] I wish I had never been born
[1:35:35] are you hearing me
[1:35:36] you know why
[1:35:38] the heaviness the distress the Weeping
[1:35:42] the anguish the sorrow the
[1:35:46] but you know one thing you don't ever
[1:35:48] read about with job this is to me is
[1:35:49] what's I've looked at this and if
[1:35:51] somebody finds it and you find it and
[1:35:52] send me a text shoot me email but I've
[1:35:54] read through and I've tried to find I
[1:35:56] don't find one place
[1:35:58] that job ever was angry with the sabians
[1:36:01] or the Chaldeans
[1:36:05] uh-oh y'all hear me
[1:36:07] so in other words he didn't attack the
[1:36:09] boss boss's picture on the wall
[1:36:13] no it's not sharp enough
[1:36:16] he might have felt like it are you
[1:36:18] hearing me
[1:36:19] come on let's let's bring it down where
[1:36:20] it's at because job's flesh is no
[1:36:23] different than our flesh
[1:36:25] but there have listen if it's not wrote
[1:36:28] in there it doesn't mean that he didn't
[1:36:30] experience anger at the sabians at the
[1:36:33] Chaldeans and what they did
[1:36:36] but what it goes to show
[1:36:38] is that from what happened and between
[1:36:41] that moment there had to be the work of
[1:36:43] the sacrifice in job's life as job was
[1:36:45] feeding off that sacrifice that was able
[1:36:47] to wash him
[1:36:48] it was able to cleanse him
[1:36:50] he didn't diminish what the sabians had
[1:36:52] done or what the Chaldeans had done but
[1:36:54] job said I am not going to allow this
[1:36:58] the valley
[1:37:03] you know what I'm talking about
[1:37:05] a lot of times feelings and everything
[1:37:06] else it can work to keep us there and
[1:37:09] let me say this over and over you hear
[1:37:10] brother Brandon put this very clear in
[1:37:12] the message we have rights
[1:37:15] job had a right to be angry
[1:37:19] job had rights are you hearing me but as
[1:37:22] sheep
[1:37:24] what do sheep do
[1:37:26] forfeit
[1:37:30] you know what I'll just be honest with
[1:37:32] you I'm not too big to ask God Lord help
[1:37:35] me to submit to the Shaving
[1:37:41] yeah are you hearing me I'm not too big
[1:37:42] to admit that
[1:37:44] God's had to bring me around to help me
[1:37:46] to see sometimes that this is what I'm
[1:37:48] trying to do finally as she comes around
[1:37:50] you don't tell me everything but there's
[1:37:52] sometimes where there's things that God
[1:37:53] has let move on experiences and it's not
[1:37:57] that I'm dwelling in the valley for
[1:37:59] years
[1:38:00] but through a period of time of what
[1:38:01] he's doing and sometimes we don't know
[1:38:03] what's going on like job we're
[1:38:06] questioning
[1:38:08] does he love me
[1:38:10] does he love me like he loves this one
[1:38:14] come on now brother Graham said he was
[1:38:16] on the ash sheep after visiting Oral
[1:38:18] Roberts place
[1:38:20] he said I was on my ash Heap I put my
[1:38:24] hand on the marble fixtures he said I
[1:38:26] went out and on my ash Heap I said God
[1:38:29] I guess you can't trust me
[1:38:34] but there was a voice that came to him
[1:38:38] and said look up
[1:38:40] I am your portion
[1:38:42] [Applause]
[1:38:44] so sometimes the ass heaps the valley is
[1:38:48] not altogether what we're thinking
[1:38:50] sometimes we don't even realize we've
[1:38:52] entered the valley
[1:38:54] and here we are and we're wondering God
[1:38:57] is it something about me is there
[1:39:00] something I'm doing wrong Lord am I I'm
[1:39:02] not doing this well enough is it not
[1:39:04] going like this is it not and you know
[1:39:05] what as a Believer you ought to thank
[1:39:07] God if you reflect on your life because
[1:39:09] as a Believer we should reflect
[1:39:13] all right let's just close I can keep
[1:39:14] going with this and we need to go I'll
[1:39:16] keep you here for a while
[1:39:21] but I think it's just so
[1:39:24] it's so crucial in the midst of these
[1:39:26] times to realize we're not standing here
[1:39:28] as secret sinners
[1:39:32] job wasn't a secret sinner
[1:39:35] job didn't understand what was going on
[1:39:37] I want you to think about this job
[1:39:39] didn't understand what was going on for
[1:39:42] 31 chapters
[1:39:47] finally at the beginning of chapter 32
[1:39:50] Ella who had showed up in Ella who said
[1:39:54] I stayed quiet
[1:39:57] but now
[1:39:58] I've got something to say I've let
[1:40:00] wisdom speak and you would think that
[1:40:02] days on this Earth should speak
[1:40:05] see Ella who was a
[1:40:07] respectful
[1:40:09] Reverend he was younger than the rest
[1:40:10] but he realized
[1:40:12] the days the age
[1:40:15] was not addressing what was going on
[1:40:20] and so Ella who came
[1:40:23] and the first thing that elohu tells job
[1:40:26] he says
[1:40:28] you've tried to justify yourself
[1:40:30] think of that
[1:40:32] you've tried to justify yourself in the
[1:40:36] eyes of God
[1:40:38] and he rebuked him for it
[1:40:40] you know why because job couldn't figure
[1:40:43] out what was going on why is this
[1:40:45] happening to me I haven't done this I
[1:40:48] haven't done that I have but you know
[1:40:50] what was powerful and at all I got to
[1:40:52] stop you know what's powerful in it all
[1:40:53] job also had the testimony he didn't
[1:40:56] move from the word of God
[1:40:59] his character might have moved a little
[1:41:01] bit but you ain't going to move that
[1:41:03] inner man that inner man is there to
[1:41:05] mold the character and pull it back in
[1:41:08] line
[1:41:10] thank God for his Mercy
[1:41:13] listen friends I may not know and I
[1:41:15] don't need to know what it is that
[1:41:16] you're going through you don't need to
[1:41:18] know what I'm going through we can we
[1:41:20] can converse with one another and I want
[1:41:22] you to understand I don't make light of
[1:41:24] what anyone would be going through I
[1:41:26] hope you understand that
[1:41:27] but neither do I glorify anything that
[1:41:31] I'm going through or you're going
[1:41:32] through
[1:41:33] the only one that needs to be glorified
[1:41:35] is the Lord Jesus because no matter what
[1:41:38] we look at in a test or a trial or
[1:41:39] whatever it is we're only
[1:41:42] going to get through it
[1:41:44] by the grace
[1:41:45] of God
[1:41:46] and if there's one thing we can say
[1:41:49] God let me have Grace that means your
[1:41:51] favor let me have Grace
[1:41:54] what kind of Grace well I think I'd like
[1:41:57] to have some Grace like Ruth because it
[1:41:59] may not be all at once
[1:42:00] but he might just drop a handful
[1:42:03] day by day
[1:42:04] he gives me just enough strength each
[1:42:07] moment to keep looking to him and keep
[1:42:10] coming back say Lord I'm looking to you
[1:42:12] you're my strength remember this Valley
[1:42:17] is not your destiny
[1:42:20] but this Valley is a predestinated
[1:42:22] appointment
[1:42:24] from God's mind
[1:42:26] to try us
[1:42:28] to perfect us to see where we're
[1:42:30] standing
[1:42:32] to see are we tied to this earth or are
[1:42:35] our Treasures in Heaven
[1:42:39] because we can't have both it's one or
[1:42:41] the other
[1:42:42] and if we evaluate and say
[1:42:45] I'm more tied to the Earth where there's
[1:42:48] a power to loosen you from that hold
[1:42:50] and a power to unite you with that other
[1:42:52] hold there's the power of the grace of
[1:42:55] God right now to break and bring and
[1:42:58] bring right here in the midst of the
[1:43:00] valley of baka sweetness
[1:43:05] where's it at just just look to him I'm
[1:43:08] sure there's a little tree he'll show
[1:43:09] you
[1:43:11] I'm sure there's a little tree he'll
[1:43:12] show you
[1:43:14] and that little tree is Calvary
[1:43:16] Moses saw that little tree it wasn't a
[1:43:19] tree that Moses had to have a chainsaw
[1:43:21] for it was just one that was sufficient
[1:43:25] that when it was placed in bitter Waters
[1:43:27] it turned those bitter Waters
[1:43:31] there's still a god who's present to
[1:43:34] sweeten Waters
[1:43:36] water don't you love him tonight
[1:43:39] wonders if he hit his bowed they go to
[1:43:41] the Lord in prayer tonight
[1:43:46] I wonder how many would like to be
[1:43:48] remembered in prayer tonight God knows
[1:43:51] amen God bless you
[1:43:54] my hand is up with you
[1:43:58] Hallelujah let's just go to God In
[1:44:00] Prayer
[1:44:03] let's look to him
[1:44:06] we're just passing through
[1:44:08] Lord Jesus
[1:44:11] Lord here tonight as we humble our
[1:44:13] hearts Lord in your presence
[1:44:17] Lord
[1:44:21] the trials and the tests
[1:44:24] or to all that that would come
[1:44:28] Lord there is
[1:44:31] as the scripture said many are the
[1:44:32] afflictions of the righteous
[1:44:35] and Lord we
[1:44:39] Lord there's just trials that we things
[1:44:42] Lord of life that happen that are truly
[1:44:45] great tragedies just like our brother
[1:44:47] Cadre Lord administered Lord
[1:44:50] but father right here tonight
[1:44:54] as you've just been speaking to our
[1:44:56] hearts and Behind These uplifted Hands
[1:45:01] Lord
[1:45:03] we don't want to be residents
[1:45:06] of the Valley of Baca
[1:45:08] that's that's not our appointment we're
[1:45:11] we're going
[1:45:13] we're going into rapture
[1:45:16] we can't escape the valley of Baka and
[1:45:18] Lord as the prophet could pray I don't
[1:45:21] want to escape him
[1:45:22] My Flesh doesn't want them Lord I'm just
[1:45:25] going to be real My Flesh doesn't want
[1:45:26] to test and trials it doesn't like them
[1:45:29] but Lord the Inner Man
[1:45:33] I know that they're necessary
[1:45:36] and we ask you for Grace Lord that you'd
[1:45:38] give us Grace
[1:45:40] to go through each one
[1:45:42] sometimes Lord like job you know Lord as
[1:45:44] even I was praying over this last week
[1:45:46] and there's things that you was even
[1:45:47] speaking to my heart there Lord
[1:45:50] there towards the beginning of last week
[1:45:52] and
[1:45:53] Lord just realizing you're leading
[1:45:56] oh how overwhelming it is Lord just to
[1:45:59] see
[1:46:00] you're working in our lives and Lord
[1:46:03] even when we're not aware
[1:46:06] but it's Lord that word having a hold of
[1:46:08] that word
[1:46:09] standing on the word of God and letting
[1:46:12] the word just have an effect in our life
[1:46:15] Lord
[1:46:16] there's a molding that's going on
[1:46:18] there's a shaping that's going on
[1:46:21] now Lord
[1:46:24] just like any any patient Lord in a
[1:46:27] hospital
[1:46:30] Lord I know that many of sitting right
[1:46:32] here tonight they remembered years ago
[1:46:34] Lord when we were ministering on certain
[1:46:37] things like forgiveness
[1:46:39] and one of the things that they'll do in
[1:46:43] many of them cancer centers
[1:46:47] they they've got confidence that
[1:46:49] medicine will work
[1:46:52] one of the things they try to find out
[1:46:54] or is there anything that'll block that
[1:46:56] medicine
[1:46:58] and one of the things that they look for
[1:47:00] are there any grudges
[1:47:03] now this is Medical Science Lord
[1:47:06] this is not
[1:47:08] Believers but this is Medical Science
[1:47:10] they can see the effect of things in
[1:47:13] that emotional realm that can actually
[1:47:15] affect and block
[1:47:17] the work of Medicine
[1:47:20] the Lord
[1:47:22] if that in itself could block the work
[1:47:24] of medicine that we would take whether
[1:47:26] interveniously or take my mouth or
[1:47:29] whatever if that if things emotionally
[1:47:31] in our
[1:47:32] body could do that
[1:47:34] then Lord how much more
[1:47:37] could things like that hinder
[1:47:39] the work of the holy spirit in our lives
[1:47:43] so Lord we ask God right here tonight
[1:47:47] Lord that you would just
[1:47:49] cleanse every channel of our life Lord
[1:47:53] if there's things the Lord that right
[1:47:55] now that in the midst of this Valley
[1:47:57] this Valley Lord when we come out of it
[1:48:00] there
[1:48:01] we are to come out stronger than when we
[1:48:03] entered in more like you
[1:48:06] and I asked God that you would help us
[1:48:08] Lord right here tonight to receive Grace
[1:48:10] in our lives
[1:48:12] Lord where the Holy Spirit would go down
[1:48:13] Lord with a real Divine evaluation and
[1:48:15] pull out and say
[1:48:17] you've got some unforgiveness you've got
[1:48:19] some bitterness you've got some anger
[1:48:21] you and going right down through and say
[1:48:23] I can't go around that but I can relieve
[1:48:27] you of that
[1:48:29] oh God
[1:48:31] we welcome you tonight Lord
[1:48:34] we welcome you tonight
[1:48:36] with the conditions that Lord that would
[1:48:38] be present in the valley and won't be
[1:48:40] present we would have a right to all of
[1:48:43] those things
[1:48:45] but God if we just as a lamb surrender
[1:48:49] our rights to you
[1:48:50] then the dove will fly back and begin to
[1:48:55] move and work and deal and strengthen
[1:48:58] our lives
[1:48:59] Lord God may we recognize
[1:49:02] Satan's desire
[1:49:04] is to get us trapped in the valley
[1:49:09] you permit the tests and trials to come
[1:49:12] but then he wants to trap us there
[1:49:14] father I
[1:49:16] just got a confidence Lord that right
[1:49:18] here tonight
[1:49:19] that you're moving Lord God among your
[1:49:21] children
[1:49:23] the Lord where there were holds and
[1:49:25] where there were things that were there
[1:49:27] that Satan has planted those seeds I've
[1:49:30] Got Confidence
[1:49:32] that the good man the son of man is
[1:49:35] moving down right now
[1:49:36] and is planting seeds that'll counteract
[1:49:39] the effect
[1:49:41] of the bad seeds
[1:49:43] that Lord would remove
[1:49:45] those hindrances Lord
[1:49:48] if we lord God will confess it
[1:49:51] and put it before you and invite you in
[1:49:54] Lord God
[1:49:55] and Lord we know that God that you're
[1:49:57] there to strengthen us and to help us
[1:50:01] we submit ourselves Lord we submit our
[1:50:03] life to you we forfeit our rights
[1:50:07] I think in the scripture of Isaiah 53
[1:50:10] when it is written of the bridegroom
[1:50:12] himself our champion
[1:50:14] the chief Shepherd
[1:50:16] but it would put
[1:50:19] that of the Bride in there and said who
[1:50:23] was led as a lamb is dumb before her
[1:50:29] shears
[1:50:31] letting us know that there is
[1:50:34] that which we must pass through
[1:50:38] because when it would be wrote In the
[1:50:40] book of Acts it would say who as a lamb
[1:50:42] was led done before his shears because
[1:50:45] there was the suffering
[1:50:48] that our Lord and savior
[1:50:50] had to go through
[1:50:52] Lord you've left more to measure for us
[1:50:54] help us Lord
[1:50:56] help us Lord as Lambs to submit
[1:50:58] ourselves to you
[1:51:00] Grant him Lord we pray
[1:51:03] in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:51:12] if you'd like to stand you're more
[1:51:13] welcome to stand
[1:51:15] Hallelujah let's just let's worship Him
[1:51:18] [Music]
[1:51:41] [Music]
[1:51:51] okay
[1:51:55] come on
[1:51:57] [Music]
[1:51:59] please
[1:52:01] oh you're never alone
[1:52:05] [Music]
[1:52:12] he's still gone
[1:52:18] when things go wrong
[1:52:23] will you make them right
[1:52:28] in the god of the good times he's still
[1:52:34] got in the bad times and the god of the
[1:52:41] day
[1:52:43] is still God in the night
[1:53:02] [Music]
[1:53:07] but it's down in the back
[1:53:11] valleys of Trials and
[1:53:15] Sensations
[1:53:17] oh that's where faith is really puts you
[1:53:25] put to test
[1:53:27] for the God on the mountain
[1:53:32] peace to God
[1:53:37] when things go wrong
[1:53:42] oh he'll make them
[1:53:44] [Music]
[1:53:47] a god of the good time
[1:53:51] he's still God in the bad times
[1:53:56] or the god of the days
[1:54:03] [Music]
[1:54:10] when we're up on the mountains
[1:54:15] foreign
[1:54:19] [Music]
[1:54:33] [Music]
[1:54:43] for the god of the mountains
[1:54:48] he still
[1:54:49] he shook the valley
[1:54:52] that's when things go
[1:54:57] oh he'll make
[1:55:00] [Music]
[1:55:02] the god of the good times
[1:55:10] [Music]
[1:55:16] he's still God in the night
[1:55:22] Hallelujah
[1:55:24] you know there's not a not a time and
[1:55:27] not a moment
[1:55:29] many times I
[1:55:30] just didn't win
[1:55:33] sometimes you get I get a text on here
[1:55:35] and
[1:55:36] can come in from overseas or
[1:55:39] other brothers right here in the states
[1:55:42] I was getting ready to go and Minister
[1:55:44] there on Friday and I don't know if you
[1:55:46] know brother Mike brother Mike altag but
[1:55:48] Pastor there in Nutbush South Carolina
[1:55:52] and he was on his way to do a funeral
[1:55:55] and he and his wife were in a very bad
[1:55:58] car accident
[1:55:59] and you hear the things that brother
[1:56:01] Mike was going through and the
[1:56:03] situations not knowing he's going to
[1:56:05] make it not knowing what was going on
[1:56:06] and you hear things
[1:56:09] it's something about it that touches our
[1:56:11] hearts
[1:56:13] as as as believers
[1:56:16] when you hear
[1:56:19] someone else that's going through
[1:56:20] something
[1:56:22] I don't know it just it always grips me
[1:56:24] you know I look at it many ways
[1:56:27] [Music]
[1:56:28] it's like for my own children I'd love
[1:56:31] to take everything from them
[1:56:35] [Music]
[1:56:36] you know there's situations that
[1:56:39] right here
[1:56:40] this young man right here playing the
[1:56:41] piano went through
[1:56:43] on his job
[1:56:46] some of them situations caused the hair
[1:56:48] on Daddy's neck to stand up
[1:56:50] and daddy wanted to go in there
[1:56:53] but I know
[1:56:54] he's got to be able to stand on his own
[1:56:56] two feet
[1:56:57] and what I had to put he didn't need
[1:56:59] daddy going in there
[1:57:00] and making him out to be a little boy
[1:57:03] but he needs to know there's one who's
[1:57:05] greater than daddy and he also needs to
[1:57:07] know that their circumstances you go
[1:57:08] through in life that you need to go
[1:57:10] through them
[1:57:12] you need to go through them and make
[1:57:14] sure who you are
[1:57:16] but what I wanted to do
[1:57:19] it killed me to see it
[1:57:21] y'all know what I'm talking about his
[1:57:22] parents killed me to see him
[1:57:25] as a pastor kills me
[1:57:29] but it does that way to a body does it
[1:57:31] not
[1:57:33] what what if I could what if I could
[1:57:35] lift every test in every trial what if I
[1:57:38] could do that
[1:57:40] my goodness
[1:57:43] what a sorry bunch of people we'd be
[1:57:46] we wouldn't be fit for the throne for
[1:57:47] nothing
[1:57:48] right we wouldn't be fit
[1:57:51] but I'm glad that God has given us
[1:57:53] something that's greater than me just
[1:57:55] saying let me take that from you
[1:57:57] because you know in reality he's already
[1:58:01] born
[1:58:02] he has already carried it I don't have
[1:58:06] to carry it
[1:58:07] but what I can do and we can do is go in
[1:58:11] prayer
[1:58:14] because the reality is when we sense
[1:58:16] that even within a body
[1:58:20] Sometimes some things that you can see
[1:58:22] sometimes and you enter in in prayer God
[1:58:24] be with sister so and so
[1:58:27] be what brother you just you just isn't
[1:58:29] something maybe you you see something
[1:58:31] you're saying what do you do enter in
[1:58:32] prayer let me tell you the greatest
[1:58:34] thing we can do is be in prayer for one
[1:58:36] another
[1:58:37] because somewhere along the line
[1:58:41] we're going to be in a valley
[1:58:43] and we're going to be back up
[1:58:46] we're going to meet back up we're going
[1:58:47] to need people
[1:58:48] who's praying for us
[1:58:51] I'm glad I'm glad that I'm part of a
[1:58:53] body
[1:58:54] I'm glad I'm part of the body of Jesus
[1:58:56] Christ but I'm glad I'm part of a local
[1:58:58] body
[1:58:59] where people love me care for me pray
[1:59:01] for me and Hold Me Up Before the Throne
[1:59:03] of God I'm glad that there's there's
[1:59:05] family there's we're able to take notice
[1:59:07] of one another and say God be with
[1:59:08] sister so and so be with brother so and
[1:59:10] so Lord be with them Lord strengthen
[1:59:12] them Lord

[1:59:21] same God that is Victorious on the
[1:59:23] mountain is the same God in the valley
