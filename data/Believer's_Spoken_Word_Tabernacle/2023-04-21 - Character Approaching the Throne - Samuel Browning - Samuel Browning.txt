[Music] amen don't you love him it's so good to be in the house of the Lord tonight to be gathered with each of you and just such a real real privilege to be in his presence and amen there's no no

that I am forgetting then good to see you back too and but I but I'm so thankful for his mercies they are Brother Carlos God bless you good to see you amen amen I'm just so thankful to the Lord and and man it's just so wonderful to be in the prince of the Lord I tell you one of the highlights of my week outside of being in his presence is to see you all and be able together with you Amen on the Thursdays and on the Sundays because we're going to spend eternity together amen so you know we we have a we have a long time coming but I'm glad it won't be on time but oh what rejoicing that we'll have then and why wait let's start now amen I just ask that the Lord will help us tonight we I want to just look at something here as we've been looking at Divine love and I come across this it was last year and I didn't even really you know it didn't didn't remember it or think of it but you know God has a timing on everything and I got to studying some weeks back on that of just looking more and sometimes I just pour over uh quotes on certain phrases and I ran across this and it brought everything back to my mind and then here I am I have all this placed in this moment and just a thought that I want to speak on tonight is still with that of a useful life but I want to speak on the thought of a character nearing the throne character nearing the throne because remember when we look at the time and the age that we're in in Revelations 3. the Lord Jesus here he is put out of the church he's uh he's a refuge he's out he's been put out they don't want him and here he is but you know in the midst of that time when he's been put out there's a group of people that's hurt him not personally to their hearts so the message has not come in vain the message Has Come Together the Mighty Men of God it's come together God's subject oh I'm sure that we as far as to the world standards and even if we would look in our own selves in the mirror we would not classify ourselves as mighty men but you know that just comes with the territory Gideon himself didn't think of himself to be a mighty man but as he stayed in the presence of God his attitude began to change not of one of arrogance but where he began to accept what God knew about him and then perfect Faith he began to operate and rely upon what the word had made him and I believe that's what we're called to tonight because we're going we're on our journey to the throne blessed to him that overcometh for he shall set with me in my throne even as I have overcome and sat down with my father in his throne we're going somewhere we're at we're at we're at the time we're at the end and I want you to think of this I don't mean to keep you standing but before I read just a couple verses brother Branham takes that takes in the message how can overcome and it takes of that of that scripture where the mother of the sons of Zebedee sons of thunder remember she comes and asks granted that one of my sons will settle on the right and one on the left what an admirable request and Jesus said well that's not that place is not mine to give in other words it's not in a moment of giving it's already been given it's already been allotted but it'll have to come into that season and the question was can you drink of the cup that I drink of and they said yes yes and he said surely you shall they were going to be partakers of the cup of Salvation they were going to be partakers of the word and partakers of his life is that right but brother Branham took that scripture and how can overcome and he said see what it is he said the test had not Fallen and that's the test for the throne we're living in the time of the throne where the bride is standing on her feet the bride is on Earth here is the Queen the real queen right there's an imposter but there's a real queen as well and the real queen is identified by the word of God it is moving and flowing and living and pulsating through her life so it's not what she's claiming but her life is a vessel that God is vindicating his word through and that Vindication silences all doubt is that right so here we are living in this time and as we're nearing that character for the throne it's a time of our character being molded and the finishing touches coming on so let's read here just a moment and about character nearing the throne in verse 9 of first Samuel 25 it says and when David's young men came they speak to nabel according to all those words in the name of David and ceased I'm sorry I didn't give you a moment to turn there and that's my fault because it wasn't on the screen but here we have this is after the death of Samuel we have that where that David and them have come upon a place and a field and named neighbors um Shepherds or those that are keeping the sheep and shearing the Sheep are out at that time and David's men have come upon them but David's men have not come to harm them but rather they've protected them so now David remember as a fugitive he's on the run right Saul is chasing him he's being hunted down like a dog he's being chased and chased and Saul is coming after him but here in the midst of that time remember he's given abimelech had given him bread the sword of Goliath and so forth so here is David he is out at the mercies of those who are going to recognize and to be able to give to him so this is where the young men now that are with David are coming to Mabel's house to make requests so we'll just let you be seated may the Lord bless the reading of the word I've had you standing here just a few moments in verse 10 if we could keep him keep on reading enable answer David's servants and said who is David now he knows who you know he knows who David is but who is David who is he and who is this son of Jesse he's got attitude who is this and the kind of like so what there be many servants nowadays that break away every man from his master so who is Dave what has David looked at as a fugitive right right that's his view is viewed as a fugitive by so many within that of Israel remember David would go and here he is in this wood and there he is with his men and there would be people in that particular inheritance that would say to Saul hey David's up here come up here and get him God would direct David David would take off right then there was even a time to where it looked like that David was going to be overtaken by Saul at one point but there came an announcement the Philistines are making an invasion come quickly so Saul when he was you know at the point of overtaking David he was drawn away and I think when we can read this within David's life because much of the Psalms it's written of David's experiences and so what you're finding is that even where David would experience things it's very much like our life and our journey right now there's a lot of times like when you think of Saul and other things that is tried to overtake you many different things have tried to overtake you and sometimes it looked like there was no way out but God Made A Way because God's already anointed David to be king and there's nothing can change that that was in God's mind before the foundation of the world is that right it was not man who chose David but God said I've got a neighbor of thine that I've chosen and God sought out David even the prophet overlooked him but the word that the prophet was commissioned with didn't overlooking amen so this word that David has been Anointed with was not the word of a man but this word has sought David out and reality of where that Saul had rejected God and put God out and it's very simple how did Saul put God out and reject him he rejected him in the simplest of obedience it all started where he himself could not wait for Samuel to do what only Samuel was supposed to do you see it shows that even in that part of of kingship and ruling that God will test our patience right down to the very last moment but that is something to where the Lord Jesus said with patience possess she your souls so Saul and the spirit of God departs from Saul is that right the kingdom has departed but God finds a little vessel that was so overlooked he was the eighth son but God here in the anointing oil is poured upon David and if I can say it in this way and I know I've mentioned this before but God was going to come back into the camp of Israel and the presence of God was going to return through a yielded vessel Hallelujah you want it and you want we want to look at how that God moves in every circumstances say Lord let me just be a yielded vessel it doesn't matter my stature doesn't matter My Size Doesn't Matter my knowledge but I'm going to stand here based on my experience Lord with you that I know where I'm standing I know you've touched my life I know you've dealt with my life and I'm going to stand right here Lord as a yielded vessel May the presence of God come into this situation may the presence of God come back into this home May the presence of God come into this job make God's presence come here and you say what is that that's a Seed of Abraham because Abraham cannot change Sarah but the presence of God could change Sarah and bring a change in her life and Abraham said I will be a channel that Elohim can come into this tent and move according to his word God has done that in this generation and he's doing it in this generation through a many-membered bride so don't ever sell yourself short you're a chosen vessel you're a chosen vessel for the king to come in power you're a chosen vessel where the kingdom of God is wrapped up in your life to be made manifest through your life your conduct your actions your behavior and that one on the inside of us when he becomes incarnate we will crown him king of kings and Lord of lords so we know in whom we have believed and we're persuaded that he is able to keep that which is committed against that day so in verse 10 as we read he's asking the question who's David who's who's the son of Jesse there's many servants nowadays that break away from every every man is Master shall I then take my bread and my water this is Nable talking and my flesh that I've killed for my shears and give it unto men whom I know not wince they be so David's young men turned their way and went again and came and told all those sayings and David said unto his men gird ye on every man his sword and they girded on every man his sword and David also girded on his sword and there went up after David about 400 men and 200 Abode by the stuff let me just say this right here David is reacting to a report that's come his way is that right because David has done good to this man and this man has spit back in his face so David said we'll leave 200 behind and the rest come with me and bring your swords because we're going to take care of business but David is this your business or God's business is this what God wants or is this your flesh that stirred up come on I'm talking about character nearing the throne character nearing the throne verse 14. but one of the young men told Abigail Mabel's wife saying behold David sent Messengers out of the Wilderness to salute our master and he railed on them but the men were very good unto us now notice this testimony of a young man who's in Abel's house is making an appeal to Abigail and he's letting her know that what our master has done but here's his testimony in verse 15. the men were very good unto us and we were not hurt neither missed we anything as long as we were conversant with them when we were in the fields they were a wall unto us by night and day all the while we were with them keeping the Sheep now therefore know and consider that thou what that will do for evil is determined against our master and against all his household for he is such a son of bilio that a man cannot speak to him now notice this young man that is moved to speak to Abigail he sees judgment is impending it's coming Upon Our House David's coming because the way that our Master responded to him there can be nothing but judgment coming our way and I want you to catch this this young man this young man is not condoning the actions of his master he said he's the son of Belial and nobody can speak to him so what he belongs to and that of the false deities and everything else it's projecting itself through his life but here is a call for one what we've just read is a call for one to intercede it's a call let there be one to intercede on our behalf because they know judgment's coming we are still under his house and judgment's coming to the house they are appealing for an interceding and they're going to Abigail I want you to think in mind here that of how the spirit of God when Grace has moved down by Revelation to reveal to you and I what you and I are not deserving or worthy of and it really strikes our heart the real revelation of Jesus Christ strikes our heart that's what this message is all about then we realize that we were not worthy that it was God's grace that came and Drew us it was God's grace that has dealt with our life and where we are standing here today is not because we have brought ourselves here but we have yielded to the grace of God and that is why we are standing where we're standing because there was something in us that was even greater than our reasonings our imaginations it was the Seed of Abraham that was on the inside and God was pulling on that sea God was drawing upon that sea to bring it in position this is why the desire is to flee from the Wrath that is to come that's why I thank God there's a warning when we look all around us we see there are lives that are not even occupied or even thinking about or even have any desire to serve God or to be in the house of God to really give themselves to God there's no desire to do that I tell you if you have a desire to serve God you are the most blessed person upon the Earth tonight a desire to please God Hallelujah you are rich with a desire to please God because the way the spirit of this world is right now it's come to the Fulfillment of Prophecy every man is a lover of himself it's all about self but here is an in call for intercession and I I think of how that the revelation of the word works because then when the revelation of the word has come it does not cause us to where we become wrapped up in ourselves wrapped up in what we see but what we have received it now causes us like Abraham to say Lord if they're sturdy will you spare the city Lord if there's 20 will you spare the city if there's 10 will you spare the city what is it once the word has come now it is the spirit of atonement that begins to intercede for others that are in need that don't even know they are in need aren't you glad you and I listen you might have set in The Message Church look I was raised up under this message but one day grace came and broke the veil from around my life till I realized I need more than a church I need more than a knowledge of this message but I need to meet the God of this message and I'm glad there was an intercession I'm glad there was a prayer that was made there in John 17 and echoed in this generation through the message of the hour that they might be one even as Thou Art In Me an intercessory prayer that is called out to pull Upon Our Lives same as Moses Hallelujah same as Daniel when Daniel made an intercessory of life remember if it was not for Daniel the whole Kingdom would have been destroyed Nebuchadnezzar told him the wise men get these fools out of here because I know what you're doing I know the tricks you're up to you don't know nothing you're only going to want me to tell you the dream and then you're going to go through and do all this and never can never say don't we're nothing we're not going to do it and we're just going to wipe it all out but Daniel stood up in that moment I ask you what gave Daniel that courage he didn't even have an answer to the problem he didn't even know the vision he didn't even know the interpretation but more important he knew the God who gives interpretations you may not know the situation you're facing tonight you may not see the outcome or the way out but let me tell you rest assured if you know that God is a Waymaker The God Who interprets circumstances and brings his children on top in Victory every time that I say rest rest in the very sovereignty and hand of almighty God Esther was drawn into a place of intercessory as well is that right sure she had to be reminded the position she was in but there was a messenger by the name of Mordecai that said you've not been placed in this position for just to forget about everything else and let things happen and Let It Go on as it is but you have come into the kingdom for such a time as this and Mordecai was a faithful messenger that spoke can I say this he spoke to the dilatoriness of Esther and he said if you don't rise up God will rise somebody up because he will not allow his purpose to be defeated Hallelujah I say God let me be that vessel tonight then how you feel God let me be the vessel why not me why not now why not ask then Abigail verse 18. she made haste and she took 200 Loaves and two bottles of wine and five sheep ready dressed and five measures of Parts corn and a hundred clusters of raisins and 200 cakes of figs and laid them on assets boy that might make you hungry right now wouldn't it true I think that that was that was a traveling Golden Corral right there verse 19 not me it was a lot she got to feed all of you remember she got to feed David's men all right this is not sending them a little snack she's sending them what they had requested what her husband returned down and rejected she said I hear the king talking what the rest of the churches don't want to honor his requests but there is a bride on Earth that says I hear what the king's longing for and the church don't want to give it but I will honor I will surrender I will submit I will give Keep Jesus what King Jesus is longing for my mama I don't want to preach it so much I just want to lay in it but boy it's good to go with these things isn't it verse 19 and she said unto her servants go on before me behold I come after you but she told not her husband nabel you know just sometimes where you just don't let the right hand know what the left hand's doing what are you talking about I'm talking about character nearing the throne sometimes it's just we did we just don't say nothing just do it and it was so as she wrote on the ass that she came down by the covert of the hill and behold David and his men came down against her and she met them I want you to notice that as I said she's got a desire this this little lady named Abigail she's she's sending these gifts and everything that David's requested those she's married her first husband is still living she's still got her first husband right but the words dealing with her life while her first husband still living yeah come on now preach with me a little bit because the new birth is where that first husband dies and the spirit of God raises up that new man on the inside is that right that that's the second man Adam is that right but she got a first husband but you see she begins to hear his requests I tell you you see this is why the Bible said that he giveth the Holy Ghost to them that obey him it's to hear his voice he that happened here let him hear what the spirit is saying to the churches she had heard like Rahab and even the condition she was in she did not allow the condition to determine whether or not she could honor the King's request it didn't matter the house didn't matter how she was born it didn't matter none of that even for Rahab the Bible said Rahab the Harlot she did not even consider the way of life and where she was living when she heard the word think about this church the word energized her and even lifted her above the complexes that she had in her life glory be to God what was it it's character nearing the throne it's the strength of the son it's the effect of Christ upon his people oh glory be to God I'll tell you there's no way for us to doubt our doubts except God sweep by he managed by his sweet by his faith and moves and energizes our faith now notice in verse 21 this is what is known of what David had said remember when they came to him with the report David had said surely in vain have I kept all this fellow hath in the wilderness so that nothing was missed of all that pertaineth unto him and he hath requited me evil for good who buddy that can be a hard pill to swallow when you do good and Evil's coming back to you right that's like putting money in the bank and you go and it says zero balance so and more also do God unto the enemies of David if I leave all that pertaineth to him by the Morning Light any that pisseth against the wall what you think about David's life let me just dwell with this just for a minute David's life David had in reverence and desire to please God I know we say we have brother Sammy he did but remember when we talk about when you're facing your enemy David is being hunted down like by Saul there ain't not one good thing that you can put on and say boy Saul's doing this real good he's doing it nothing he's hunting him down like a dog but David is setting his affections on things above are you hearing me now David's desire to please God in reverence God is what affects his conduct towards Saul are you hearing me it ain't because Saul deserves it if some God what it deserved he'd have had more than just a clipping taken off the skirt of His Garment he'd had his head taken off and David could have done it twice right so there's no reason there's no merits there's nothing there's not one little speck of anything that you can find that boy Saul's a good guy towards David you can't find that been run the contrary but what is it that causes David to honor a man Anointed with an evil spirit and is so wrong because of his desire to please God oh you hear me talk about a character that's nearing the throne see David is aware when he's looking at this David has a relationship with God that's what's affecting David and once you think about this there's a reverence to the things of God remember how brother Bram says how that Satan um how about the Lord Jesus through every Temptation remember how he said he defeated Satan he said he overcame him by the word remember brother I'm saying that then brother Brown says he overcame him by love right he overcame well how did he overcome the enemy it wasn't just because he was good at quoting scripture he overcame because he was yielded and he reverenced the word of God above his own wants and sometimes our wants friends are not about hunger and mourning this and one and that sometimes our wants is wanting to say something when it's a Wrong Time to Say Something hello I'm talking about character nearing the throne God tempering a people because if we're going to rule and reign with him God is tempering our character it's true a lot of our buttons that get pushed and all that there's going to be a complete change not just back to a young person again but God's going to change us all the way through and through but our character is what will be harvested out of this Earth a character that has been molded and shaped by tests by trials by things that we've come into and we've tried to get out of we've tried to pray our way out of it we've tried to pray it away and God has an appointment to mold our character because remember the Holy Ghost is the gift of God but character is not a gift it's a victory and so God is molding in our life victory after Victory after victory so I want you to think about this with David remember in the scripture as a Bible reader it was David's Behavior because Saul didn't know he had been anointed nobody told him it was a secret remember whatsoever he hath whatsoever the Lord see it in secret that he will reveal openly right that's a revealing of this third pool the revealing of the word it's in that secret place with God it will be revealed openly and what you find in the scriptures of how that Saul could look at David and the Bible says he knew God had anointed David to be king because he behaved himself wisely not because he had flu Goliath right right not because of all these other but because it wasn't because he slayed this when he killed this when he did this it was his behavior that was displayed that said this man is the one who's King his behavior wow that's powerful isn't it no wonder as the spirit of God would draw our attention in this end time it did not put the emphasis on Miracles it did not put the emphasis on emotion we believe in all those things it did not even put the emphasis on the just the written word it put the emphasis on the very character of Jesus Christ stepping into a group of people and molding our character to match his own glorious character that we would have the same ministry as the Lord Jesus Christ you love him so here David behaved him so he was Behavior it was the word it was that behavior that that anointing it was it was being expressed through his life even when he had others think of it God listen friends God permitted it don't hate or go ahead you know start hating those men I tell you David had those guys around him and them guys said hey David right there he is God has delivered him into your hands look I'm trying to get all scriptural and given him quotes and there you go David take his life there he is the almighty God who has delivered him into your hands but David knew the Bible said Thou shalt not touch the Lord's anointed nor do His prophets any harm and David the work if the man you respect the office is that right so here David was respecting that office and David knew that was the word of God I'm not treading over the word of God David could have tore salt down he had encouragement all around him are you hearing me he had counsel all around him take his life here he is twice twice but see David took all of those voices that was coming and he filtered it through the word now let's think facing you think David wasn't tempted this guy's tired of running for his life are you with me is you get him back in the corner he's feeling like defending himself on Facebook oh preach with me now he feels like he's got it man I gotta rise up and defend myself right oh that all that was there but what David did is he filtered Every Voice through the word of God what was it showing God didn't remove those were choices David had to make God chose David that's true but David yielded to God he yielded his emotions he surrendered his wrath he surrendered his anger he surrendered Vengeance he surrendered it to almighty God and said this is your word Lord It's hard right now to obey it but I humble myself to your word because your word is right no matter what my emotions say no matter what my thoughts say no matter what all around me say your word is right what is it character nearing the throne let me just skip over that you can read that later if you want to when you get home second Peter chapter three when Peter speaks of the time we're living in and Peter would say it maybe just to read just a verse of scripture in verse 11. seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what men are persons ought you to be in all holy conversation and godliness looking for and hastening unto the coming of the day of God I want to be ready I want to be ready is that right we're in the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved in the elements shall melt with Urban heat I I want to go on and have the admonition because friends we see the things all around us and let me just say not only we see it we feel the pressures in the past years our patients have been tried Temperance our self-control has been tried because we see we see and we feel the pressures but that's where we have to say Lord renew my patience because we've got a promise as children of God we shall see him as he is and every man that hath this hope in him purifyeth himself how can I be pure without the washing of Water by the word let's just see the blessedness of the word The Living Word coming down and dealing with our life what's God doing he's coming to bring cleansing and as we say yes Lord be it unto me that's the truth Lord I give myself to that what's it doing there's a refreshing there's a renewing within our lives we are not set aside as Christians to be independent or in other words self-reliant we need him he is our husband we are his bride we need him we need the washing of Water by the word we need the Living Word coming down and Discerning our life and reminding us what manner of persons ought we to be we are people we're nearing the time of the throne we are nearing the time of the rapture we are nearing the moment where our bodies shall be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye we are nearing the wedding supper we are nearing the millennium the promises of God all to think of it how Paul could write about Isaiah spoke of it that we are the people on whom the ends of the world have come right here and we see this as a if I can use the words of the prophet it is an unfit age for humans to live in we see the crumbling of all world we see the hatred glorification of sin evil and wickedness but I want to remind you we've got a sure place to look to amen hallelujah the Bible tells us when you begin to see all these things lift up your head your Redemption draweth nigh when you feel like oh God my patience is getting short lift up your head your Redemption drawing now you need a refreshing in your life of temperance a refreshing of patience lift up your head your Redemption draweth now there is a fresh deposit of the glory of almighty God that is set aside for your life you are not left destitute he did not save you I'd fill you with the Holy Ghost and move away and leave you he's right there inside of you the whole time and before he was in you he was watching over you he was by you the whole time there wasn't a song wise enough smart enough big enough that could overtake God's plan and purpose for your life Hallelujah verse 23 of first Samuel 25. and when Abigail saw David she hasted and she lighted off the ass and remember she sent Goods she sent his request before him she's coming to approach him but she says let what he's asked for go before me battle testify of the heart that's coming to him when Abigail saw David she hasted she lighted off the ass and failed before David on her face and bowed herself to the ground and fell in his feet and said upon me my Lord upon me let this iniquity be I want you to watch this let it be on me watch just watching I'm talking about character that's nearing the throne and let thine handmade I pray thee speaking thine audience and hear the words of thine handmaid let not my Lord I pray thee regard this man of Belial even neighbor as for his name is so is he Nable is his name and Folly is with him but I watch this thine handmade see she's already a separation is coming by the word her first husband is still alive but separation is coming by the word she's been drawn to the word in obedience notice but thine handmade saw not the young men of my Lord whom thou didst sin now what's she doing she's distancing herself from the wrong that has been done yet I want you to watch this and she's doing that by first asking for forgiveness yes now no we could we could barter or we could say a lot of things and say Abigail you didn't even hear it you're not the one who reject it and you're saying let this iniquity be upon me well I got everybody's attention now don't I I'm talking about character that's nearing the throne we're not living in a time of ignorance we're living in a time of the full revealing of the son of man we're living in a time when the hearts and the secrets of men are being made known we're living in a Time that Secrets cannot remain hidden God will bring it to light but it depends John when God brings things to life where do you stand if you make excuses for it it will remain but that's where you have to identify with the word of God let me just put it this way if there's something that is within the family and you can say well Lord I see yes I see I I do this but but you know my my grandpa was like this my daddy was like this you can have a quote where it says Spirits travel in families but I've got more quotes that says when the Holy Ghost the abstract is called that it cuts off any claim of the devil upon that life come on friends we're talking about the strength of the coming of the Holy Ghost the quickening power in this hour it is the abstract to the title deed and that's why the prophet could stand there in Rising of the sun he said you see this little epileptic child but he said once that life has received the Holy Ghost he said that does not have a claim upon her life I don't care what the family tree says you've been grafted into another one must I do side with the word is that right but brother Samuel's heart it was hard for David not to take Saul's head off but he sided with the word why it was a character coming to the throne she knew judgment was coming I want you to watch this in verse 26. now therefore my Lord as the Lord liveth what's Abigail speak now and as thy soul liveth seeing the Lord hath withhold thee from coming to shed blood whoo this little lady is prophesying she's announcing the reason you haven't come to shed blood is because the Lord had withheld thee now I want to remind you David ain't setting in the tent when she meets him David's on his horse he's got his sword and the men are ready to go and take heads off but she's announcing the Lord has with whom thee what is it she's taking the word and she submitted herself to the word that you're the one who's King you're the one who's coming into King and she's taken that word and she glory be to God she is reflecting even a position that she doesn't have right then as far as being manifested but she even in her actions to the word is reflecting where her position will be glory be to God sing the Lord hath withhold in thee from coming to shed blood and from avenging thyself with thine own hand notice from avenging thyself with thine own hand oh the words calling it out this is about you David this is about you David I know you're the anointed of the Lord but the reason you got your sword out and you're ready to go take somebody's head off because this is about you they've offended hallelujah boy this is good in there now let thine enemies and they that seek evil to my Lord be his neighbor and now this blessing which thine handmade hath brought unto my Lord let it be given unto the young men that follow my Lord so all these these Treasures these gifts I want you to give it to the young men that follow my Lord notice where she's placing herself she's humbling herself and I pray they watch this in verse 28 I want you to notice there's three things here I pray thee forgive the trespass of thine handmaid but Abigail what have you done but she said I pray thee forgive the trespass of thine handmaid now watch because remember she wasn't even there I just read your scripture before Abigail could have said it wasn't me I wasn't even there I wasn't even there but what she recognized is I was born into this household or I was in this household come on now come on friends that's why when we repent we repent from letting that Fierce nature rule over us is that what it is because that real seed of God on the inside never did Sin is that right from God's mind it never did Sin in the beginning but that repentance is from allowing that old nature to rule and to Reign and project in our life so notice where she's at she is praying Lord she's praying to David forgive the trespass of thine handmade now I want you to watch how brother M said this I ran across this hearing the message my new ministry brother I'm saying you don't have to be rich and mighty in this world to be great in the sight of God you only have to be humble in your heart and God calls that greatness how many one be great remember the same I don't want to be great no I want to be great like this not great like the world says great I want to be great according to God's greatness his humbleness he that's great enough to Humble himself that's a great person that'll take the blame for everything that'll humble himself that's greatness I say this is the Bride of Jesus Christ a character that's nearing the throne are you with me now this is a people who is looking at it it's not so-and-so's fault it's not this person's fault that there is nothing if there is something about me it is not somebody else's fault it is between me and God and say God remedy this out of my life is that right because that's the only way that God's ever going to deal with it correctly she has the right approach is that right now remember this is not odd to the children of God when Daniel when the third pole visitation is made known to Daniel in Daniel chapter 9 when Daniel said I understood by the books in other words what Jeremiah and the rest have prophesied concerning the departure after 70 years I have understood by the books that this is the time and what you find Daniel going into he calls himself in sackcloths Daniel chapter nine you can read it he closed himself in sackcloth and he begins to make confession and what does he say we have sinned oh God we have transgressed O Lord not they have they have but we have oh God what is he doing he is one in humility of heart that is asking intercession for the people of Israel Israel chapter 9 one of my favorite chapters in the scripture when you deal with repentance is Ezra chapter nine this is something for years and years almost 20 years or more at some movement because Ezra stands there when he comes back in the land and Ezra sees them marrying and going about other peoples of the land and them still doing the according to the Canaanites and doing this and doing that and Harry takes pluck's hair out of his beard and he begins to set down before God and he is he is troubled he said God what are your people doing here he said here we are the transgressions and notice notice how Ezra approaches it you can read it when you get home he said Lord you laid less upon us than what we deserve Lord we deserve to be consumed for all the iniquities and our transgressions you say what is the value of that because where the spirit of atonement is the spirit of God is able to move out and change lives and change Hearts glory be to God when the prophet saw the preview of the Bride he never said is that the best they can do he said is that the best we can do why because this message stays with this generation to draw out a bride what is it shelling he's still on The Mercy Seat and God's spirit of atonement is still at work to intercede on our behalf until that final name is splashed the next part established on the word that's what she says in verse 28. for the Lord will certainly make my Lord a sure house notice my Lord who will the Lord will he's the one's going to make you a sure house but David be careful your foundation be careful your foundation because of whatever you take with you whatever you do will translate into your kingdom if you cut Corners here your kingdom will be a corner cutting Kingdom if you cut Corners before marriage your marriage will be a corner cut in marriage are you with me that's why it's so important it's so important to lay and to have God let God Be The Sinner notice for the Lord will certainly make my Lord a sure house so David notice David's not responsible for bringing himself to the throne you ever think about David when David could sit there and think and think I wonder how many more days I've got of this a running for my life alarm clock goes off snooze you better get up boy you better get up don't snooze it too long because you might miss it your head might be rolling what are you gonna do David today I'm gonna run from alive David where are you settling down I don't know I'm just running and you're anointed to be the king really and you're running like that he was being pursued by Saul but he had a character that was fitted for the throne notice because my Lord fighteth here's why because my Lord fighteth for battles of the Lord look at this discernment she's already said if you go you're going to avenge yourself but she's already declared now notice testifying of that trueness that seed that righteousness on the inside you are the one who's fighting the Lord's battles God's using you God's working through your life you realize brother Ram talks about it in this way I've got the quote here but I'm just let me paraphrase it he said when you consider what takes place here on the platform he said it's me yielding myself and God coming down and taking control he said now if I ever got in my mind that it's me he said God won't come and then he takes right the very next paragraph and he says if when somebody says something about you and you go to take after him he said God can't fight your battles because you're fighting them now I know I'm not going to ask this question because I'm I don't know I want I don't know what kind of hands I get if I raise this if I ask the question who's ready to fight some battles I'm afraid we'll come out of some purses and how to some coats and then so we won't ask that question we just think God made the spirit of God come in metal hearts here tonight come on friends because just like David there are times that we have felt like David he could not have cut a piece out of Saul's skirt if his sword had been sheathed are you with me that's the enemy that had moved up next to him when I was about ready to say if that's how he's going to be sword was already out of the sheath and he had taken even a peace but you know that peace that he took out of him it might have been a piece on Instagram a piece on Facebook a piece to somebody that he had to repent of that peace touch not the Lord's anointed do my prophets no harm is that right now look at this and evil hath not been found in thee all by faith in that a paradox I mean really here is a man that's getting ready to avenge himself has nothing spiritual about it whatsoever it's all about him and here stands Abigail moved by the word but you see what the word is doing it's discerning the real truth on the inside aren't you glad when we come to the house of God sometimes maybe we've already gone up in our mind to avenge ourselves I'll tell you what I tell you I have been burnt in this meeting right here and tomorrow when I when I I'm going to send them that email tomorrow I am going to talk to the Boston I am gonna aren't you glad when we get in the presence of God that the sweetness and tenderness of the dove of almighty God will come right back around and say hey wait a minute there is no evil found in thee what's it doing it's the word examining the word on the inside what's it doing it's lifting up that christ-like character I'm glad to be reminded of who I am aren't you oh my there's a Proving Grounds that we are in Even In This Moment now let me just try to to finish this here in verse 29 yet a man Abigail says yet a man has risen to pursue thee and to seek thy soul but the soul of my Lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the Lord thy God and that is powerful man a man is coming to pursue you and to seek thy soul but the soul of my Lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the Lord thy God and The Souls of thine enemies them shall he sling out as out of the middle of a sling can I read to you this is one of the only places you only hear Brother Brown talk about Abigail twice and this is the quote right here weeks ago when I was studying on certain things and I ran across it just just set in on a bank of quotes and I ran across this I thought dear Lord this is what took me back to this this thought Brown is talking to the people of God and he's talking about how the word has come forth and brought correction and how that we're to respond to the word and he says if I could just break in here and he says Pentecostal preachers sometimes and men will go downtown and you'll see him on the streets sometimes we'll just jump into traffic and consider your friends if you see him fixing to get a ticket I don't care who it is put a nickel in don't let him be fined now watch what brother Brown's talking about he's talking about how that they would go down the street if you see the you know go by the meter if something's getting ready to expire they would see one of their people there and they would go ahead and put that Nickel in the person may not have even known it was getting ready to expire now watch what he's going into even in everything it will grow on you there's a lot of things grow on us right there's a lot of things can grow on us some things that might as well might as well say it the way we understand it sometimes they're growing on us so we think about is irritants things that can irritate us and frustrate us but that's not what brother M's talking about brother Graham's talking about in everything if you go to start doing the things that are right it'll grow on you try to be good to one another try to shake hands and be friendly and nice I know I know we talk with people just like when I talk with individuals and I said you know it's funny because you might say like I don't feel like doing this I don't feel like holding hands or I don't feel like wow isn't it amazing how we live by our feelings but sometimes you've got to do the hard things and that's when feelings will come that's right and then feelings will come to what's right are you hearing me now watch this watch our brother and Praises it try to shake hands and be friendly and nice tear down on the walls of partition around you that's malice different and ungodly and tear it down how do I tear it down by doing what's right if there's malice between do what's right towards that person do what's right towards that individual y'all tired you need me just to close right now we can come back to this bundle of Love next week here tear it down that's malice and different ungodly tear it down keep doing good to one another and every time you meet one another make yourself be good to one another oh Lord I just thought the Holy Ghost would do that well he will he'll equip you but notice make yourself be good to one another hello notice and the first thing you know it'll grow around you I love that till a bundle of love will wrap you up that's the marking of God by this all men shall know you're my disciples that you have love one for another see what you have to evaluate is is all of your actions is what you're doing by love is what you're doing and the way you're responding and acting is it by your own reasonings or is it by the word if the character of God is against it then you ought to lay that aside and be against it too we're talking about a character that's near the throne listen friends you cannot change things on your own ways and your own measures you must come according to the word of almighty God now let me just let me let me move into this here this is where brother Ram's talking about this here what did what did he say what did he say about little David when he was up there and Abigail this is one of the places brother man talks about Abigail he said she said your soul is wrapped in a bundle of love when Abigail the great woman that met David we know that your enemies will be flung out like a sling that's right because you're wrapped in the bundle of the love of God oh if I want to be bound up let me be bound up in the love of God I don't want to be bound up with entertainment I don't want to be bound up with hurt feelings I had up with bitterness I want to be bound Up Tangled Up Tied Up in Jesus I want to be bound up with the love of God well how do you get bound up with something it'd kind of be like taking a string and you start having somebody you know when you're doing somebody that sometimes they'll do what is it mummified and where they'll do toilet paper around them and you're spinning around young people know that they do those kind of games you spin around until you keep taking the role around them and around them and around them around them you got to keep going around them that's how with being bundled up with the love of God do you realize it ain't just something that all I'm gonna pray till I become a great big bundle you must have action to go with your prayers and that action will also be what humility responding to what you don't feel like responding to it'll be something where you make yourself do what's right because the word says it's right and I'm doing it because I reverence God not because I'm condoning this action or this Behavior but I'm going to act according to God's word because sometimes you're tried when a person's behavior is out of line but you're tried what are you going to do are you going to respond and avenge yourself or are you going to act according to the word of God preach with me now oh my I want to be wrapped in a bundle of love because that's what he's coming to Rapture let me just move on here can I can I finish this up let me just finish this verse 30. and it shall come to pass when the Lord shall have done to my Lord according to all the good he has spoken concerning them I'll tell you she's a believer she said God's going to perform all that he has done concerning you glory be to God I'm glad that this is somebody that weren't coming alongside of David like the rest of them and saying get him David get him David boy I'll tell you David he's a nasty guy oh he's done you wrong he's done this no but here is character nearing the throne now remember some of them other guys hello some of them other guys that were urging David on David told Solomon when Solomon came into his kingdom he said don't you let joab's head stay on him why because joab will do what joab wants to do when it's convenient for joab is that right there's plenty of where are these examples there in the scripture where job did things that was not according to what David requested Joe have acted on his own accord and did what Joe had felt to do Joe had looked I'm going to advance the kingdom you don't Advance it outside of the word I don't care how much you're pulled to at the test or trial but a character that'll stay right with the word of God are you hearing me now it shall come to pass when the Lord shall have done to my Lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee and shall have pointed thee ruler over Israel that this shall be this situation shall be no grief unto thee nor a fence of heart unto my Lord either that thou has shed blood Costless but he did me evil but here is Abigail saying David God's going to fulfill his word you can't stop his word but you don't want to take regrets with you you don't want to take regrets with you David let your anger cease forsake Wrath you say brother Samuel I thought David was the king he is and Abigail is a part of his bride will be you want to see the heart of the Bride in the end time this is it right here a character that's nearing the throne a character that was the same way when he was hung on the cross and they pulled beard from him and he was reviled but reviled not back when he to patiently his good he was shedding his blood for all of mankind and he said father forgive him for they know not what they do oh my I said be it unto me Lord a character Nearing the throne but when the Lord shall have dealt well with my Lord then remember Don handmaid can I have just a couple more minutes a few scriptures that's it now after Abigail she has become so one here I know if I'm kind of Move Along on a type in one way Abigail here she is she is expressing the very desire of God to David let me ask you upon this earth right now who's expressing back to God his desire is it the denominations is it the people of this world or is it his beloved bride it's his pride there's one that he comes down to speak to and commune with one that will receive him and accept him one that will line up with the word no matter what it cost but she will Minister back to him displaying she's becoming one with the word and David said to Abigail now watch this testimony blessed be the Lord God of Israel which sent thee this day to meet me I wonder if Abigail felt very spiritual when she went to meet David but David is identifying the Lord has sent you because if God hadn't sent you everybody would have been dead including you is that right and blessed be thy advice wow and blessed be thou which hath kept me this day from coming to shed blood and from avenging myself with my own hand see this was not going to be about the Lord this was about David this was about David aren't you glad how God can discern those things in our lives sometimes but we man everything is lined up just right and God said that's all about you all damn scriptures and all them quotes and all those things they're like the Leaning Tower of Pisa it's leaning toward you hello for in varied deed as the Lord God of Israel liveth which hath kept me back from hurting thee except thou hadest hasted and come to meet me surely there had not been left unto neighbor by the Morning Light any that pisseth against the wall so David received of her hand that which she had brought him and said to her go in peace to thine house see I have hearkened to thy voice and have accepted by person verse 39 let's stand and when David heard that nabel was dead when he heard that her first husband not only she divorced he's dead now he sins to take her to be United she's going to be one with him blessed be the Lord that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of nabel and have kept his servant from evil I'll tell you I think we all can identify with that right there is Lord you have kept my hand many times maybe kept my fingers kept my kept my mouth because in this day and age kept my fingers from dot kept Lord you've kept me back from evil ain't nothing to be ashamed of to say he's kept me back from Evil that's to glorify him and realize he has given us Grace to even with strain and hold back things that sometimes we were tempted to say and might have been absolutely the truth that it all matters the spirit that it's set in is that right because truth can be truth but it's the spirit that it's set in that matters here's a character nearing the throne I believe I'm looking at people I believe I'm one of them of character nearing the throne lives that are coming out from the things of the world coming out from underneath the household of our families coming out from every excuse and every reason and saying Lord mold me and shape me you know what you placed in my life Lord let my character be molded to your glorious character let my life be so wrapped up brother Shane let it be so tangled up to where when all when you see my life all you see is bad guys are tangled up mess oh no I'm a bundle of love I'm just I'm just Tangled Up In Love well how does that happen brother Samuel well it doesn't happen by somebody just going around me but it's me going and doing the things that is even the right things to do see so many times we look at things of that it's got to be gone to it is that right you we hear that preached over and over it's got to be god-to and it's true it does have to be God do it but this right here the prophet has given us instructions even when you look at Abigail judgment was not abated until the gifts that were sent that was requested I wonder how hard it was to load all them all that material because it wasn't just like you know all these delivering the groceries on your steps in four or five boxes they've got to feed David's Army right you got all this is loaded up I mean this one just like some little small truck a Swan's truck driving down and open up this is a lot but she is so concerned with his request that she says put this put this put this but this but this but this but this this this what's she doing all that he has said I want to honor his request how many feel that way tonight Lord I want to honor the request I want to be I want to just be so lined with that word Lord let MRI after MRI come across my life if there's anything that's out of line I want my life to be a display like Esther's was Esther or Abigail displayed a more excellent way that of charity let's pray father I believe Lord that we're Nearing the moment of Deliverance we're here in this season we're here in this time like Esther like Abigail like the rest we have been placed here [Music] for such a time as this Lord God May our hearts like Abigail making haste [Music] laying down lord our willing down ourselves before your feet Lord God made our lives Lord I pray just so capturing the heart of this message to where the heart of this message can be projected right back to you and be projected to others [Music] this message has never come [Music] to bring death it's come to bring life oh sure sometimes Lord when things don't go our way like it was in the city of Samaria when you had set your eyes and your mind to go to Jerusalem John arose in that time and said should we call fire down from heaven upon but once that same man God in your presence after the sacrifice had been offered and the coming of the Holy Ghost here came a man that was ready to avenge himself because somebody wouldn't receive him he was ready to call fire down foreign but you would let him know the son of man has not come to destroy lives but to give life what I believe is we stand here your Prophet has taught us and souls in prison in other places through the message we see it in the scriptures we've been committed to us a word of reconciliation by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit your Prophet Lord would speak we have been made co-partners with you in Redemption Lord the speaking and the living and the projecting of this word in this hour a word that has been spoken over this generation and here of Lord if we can say it in this way here's the Lord part of the Abigail that has responded to the king who is coming into power oh God May our hearts Lord be so tendered Lord recognizing your presence not living for this Earth this world this moment but may we lord God help us I pray that every action every decision may we lord God weigh it in the balance Lord of Eternity Lord to recognize oh God I want my character Lord to be so molded and fitted because your word is surely coming to pass I don't want no regrets I don't want no regrets I don't want to carry offenses I don't want to carry Lord I don't want to be a carrier of that I only want to be a carrier of the love of God Glory Lord of our life Lord would be so wrapped up [Music] in that bundle of love as your Prophet would bring that out from the scripture there [Music] help us Lord I know my brothers and sisters all around we feel the pressures Lord there's things that set all around us we see the Lord God of this world is falling apart but oh God let us Lord in this moment these closing moments Lord I want to be wrapped for rapture I want to be clothed for Rapture I want to be wrapped up Lord as your Prophet said that as that bride she nears the headstone she becomes more like him granted Lord I pray tonight character Nearing the throne [Music] I thought of how brother Branham said it like this he said you can take the meanest woman on this woman he said but here she is with child he said as he gets close to the time of delivery he said she becomes so sweet so nice she could be the most meanest woman there is he said but what it is there's a little spirit that begins to move around that's going to move right into that child when it's delivered [Music] and how he will tie that in with the bride of Jesus Christ nearing the time of the very change of our bodies as we're nearing him nearing him you want to know the effect of getting close to him drawing closer to him it's the same way we're near the time for the delivery of the son getting Kinder sweeter by what by his presence and our theophany Drawing Near like that little spirit that would hang around that little mama it's waiting for that baby to drop so is our theothenes right around us right near us ready for what to take one step from this Dimension into that dimension those that are alive and remain what will it be we will take our glorified body to meet our theophany those who have already entered into the theosomy will come right back and pick up a glorified body oh it's what a time of uniting that we are heading for I say God give us Grace Till They be lay aside every difference maybe really aside if there's anything in our heart that's not right that's not pleasing if there's anything within you that would even even seem to get even avenge yourself say Lord sweep down right here Lord let the love of God just so sweet down lord let it sweep down let it clear it out let him minister to your heart character that's Nearing the throne go ahead brother Brian [Music] in the name of Jesus Christ [Music] the truth truth says [Music] [Music] Heavenly Father you're the same God according to your promises [Music] the truth that sets me free according to the doorhere Lord [Music] according to your promises stay insecure right upon my heart a truth that says [Music] according to yourself [Music] for Jesus Hallelujah [Music] foreign [Music] thank you Jesus [Music] Lord it gives me home yes Lord every [Music] day is [Applause] [Music] so when [Music] the all you stream and your heart feels torn remember God God is greater than the storm [Music] the battle is the Lord there is a soul in times of [Music] times if that gives me hope that brings me peace My Savior stands in my defense when the road you are leaves you tired and warm the strength is gone and your heart your heart feels [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] ERS rise he calls my name is [Music] he holds my head Starship born foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]

to God blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus thank you Father thank you Lord oh my I think is a song brother Brian had just sung take courage battle is the Lords God has spoken what he sees in you oh sure there's things that he deals with but the things that he's dealing with how could he deal with it without revealing himself and the true character of who we really are as I said moments ago what a paradox for Abigail to say no evil has been found in thee not just any action but he already has a contemplation a thought to avenge himself but there's something deeper aren't you glad there's something deeper in you something deeper me I'm glad there's something deeper that that says hey we're not going that way aren't you glad oh I'm so thankful something is holding me I'm so thankful there's a real pool in this hour I'm so thankful there's Grace that comes and loosens loosens our life I'm glad he goes down I want him to go down on the inside friends I want him to go down deep I want the spirit I want the ministry because the bride has a Ministry that reaches into the very heart it's not the bride it's Christ in the bride that reaches into the very heart I want a word that's not a sighting with my flesh I want a word that's bringing out a real son and daughter of God if it cuts me let it cut me because everything it cuts away is not me every chump that was left on the ground was not what Michelangelo had in his mind what remained is what he had in his mind every chunk that God takes away say God take it away let his grace just move and calm right down through our life because we cannot take anything like that with us and Lord I don't want it to even hold me EarthBound while I'm here even if I've only got one more day to live even if I only got one more week one more month one more year 10 years I don't want to stay down beneath my privileges because I'm holding something to avenge but Lord I accept your grace Lord God that I might live in Liberty as a character Nearing the throne oh blessed be his name Heavenly Father may you go with us tonight Lord go with your children watch over us upon the roadways keep us the Lord as the angels of God has taken their Post in this building tonight Lord God as we will leave May father the angels of God grant traveling mercies to every one of your children Lord [Music] help us Lord help us let our hearts
