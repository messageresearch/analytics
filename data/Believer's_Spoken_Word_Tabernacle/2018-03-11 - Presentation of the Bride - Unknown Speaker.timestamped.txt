[46:07] promise been called to the rest day
[46:08] after day but all here we stand in the
[46:11] in the very brink any moment any moment
[46:15] I was just thinking the other morning
[46:17] you know many times I'm sitting there
[46:19] and you know I'm looking at things and I
[46:22] know it's sometimes it ain't the light
[46:23] because it's still dark and I'm just
[46:26] sitting there in the living room and
[46:27] just listening to a message and you just
[46:29] see something and you're looking at the
[46:31] window I thought I said Lord wouldn't
[46:34] this be wonderful if you come today I
[46:37] said oh wouldn't had just be wonderful
[46:39] I believe that unless I really believe
[46:41] that you know brother George Smith when
[46:43] he was here he referred to that that
[46:44] part where when sister media was really
[46:47] missing her mother and he mentioned that
[46:49] party said she's sitting right there in
[46:51] that chair and you know the thing of it
[46:53] is is that we we know we don't talk to
[46:56] them but to think of that reality that
[46:58] they are closer they're closer and
[47:02] they're they're getting closer but it's
[47:05] not just them getting closer we're
[47:07] getting closer it's God bringing us
[47:10] right into that place that that what he
[47:13] already has made a way for me I'll tell
[47:16] you I know it's simple but it's just to
[47:18] me it just so swallows my heart up and I
[47:20] feel my heart just get so big to really
[47:23] to think about it that it is God who
[47:26] sought us out God already made the
[47:29] Covenant was already made and he came
[47:31] and drew us unto himself and the
[47:33] Covenant being fulfilled is not about
[47:35] what we're gonna do it's what he has
[47:38] already done the only thing he needs us
[47:40] to do is just get out of the way and
[47:43] surrender
[47:44] I'd say lord help me help me just to be
[47:46] more surrender just so that life can
[47:48] flow through and you know one thing
[47:50] about it I love and how that truly the
[47:52] the message of the hour brought such a
[47:55] true portray
[47:56] of the Lord Jesus Christ he's a
[47:58] gentleman he's a gentleman
[48:00] he know he knows how to treat his wife
[48:03] in that wonderful he knows how to woo
[48:06] her and bring her into that place he
[48:08] doesn't demand her and say now you've
[48:09] got to be yielded know he knows how to
[48:11] woo her in that wonderful oh my it's so
[48:15] good to be in the house of the Lord this
[48:17] morning and we had such a wonderful
[48:19] service last night and my I just so
[48:22] thankful for the presence of the Lord
[48:24] the word that came forth
[48:25] I just want just to share a few slides
[48:28] with you before we take the mission
[48:29] offering just so you have a little bit
[48:31] of an idea v what we're looking at with
[48:35] a project here and if they would pull
[48:38] that up d do you have that there I just
[48:42] wanted to show you you're aware that
[48:44] within the Philippines there's thousands
[48:47] of islands that are there I'm not going
[48:49] to try to give the exact number but I
[48:50] want to hone in to the area that we that
[48:52] really the need is is for if you go to
[48:55] the next slide you see right here is it
[48:59] starts to hone in a little bit more out
[49:01] of Manila and it's actually gonna be in
[49:04] this area right up in here what we're
[49:06] actually looking at go to the next one
[49:07] would you please and that hones right in
[49:10] and this is that Salim eylem island here
[49:13] that we brother Gerry myself had and
[49:16] went to and ministered there that
[49:17] evening and we just took a boat or ferry
[49:20] from the mainland and went out there and
[49:22] and ministered and there's brothers from
[49:24] from Ty Ty and palawan that are actually
[49:26] gonna be working on this boat go and go
[49:28] to the next slide there you see what are
[49:31] the boats that only the only
[49:32] transportation to that island of too
[49:35] lame there is is by boat and it's when
[49:37] they get there to that Island you can
[49:38] kind of see how the mountainous it is go
[49:41] to the next slide and the where it is is
[49:44] we went in one place over here I don't
[49:46] know exactly where it's at but the one
[49:48] little brother who's actually taken over
[49:51] a church where that another pastor used
[49:55] to go over this island but that other
[49:57] pastor also there was a boat that was
[49:58] there he could do it this little this
[50:00] little brother brother VIN brother then
[50:02] actually he actually will walk over
[50:05] these mountains and get to the other
[50:07] places but it you know that also takes
[50:09] it takes quite
[50:10] at a time so he's walking right now in
[50:12] doing that and one of the things that
[50:14] was expressed it's not just for brother
[50:16] VIN but you've got so many congregations
[50:18] because there's this looks like one big
[50:20] island but there's so many multiple
[50:21] little islands that that map doesn't
[50:23] even show it around - Liam Island and
[50:25] they have so many needs to baptize souls
[50:29] that have come in through the Expos plus
[50:31] there's a need to follow up with these
[50:33] churches that have all come in and so
[50:35] that that's the whole purpose with the
[50:36] boat so that they're able to get around
[50:38] a little bit more quickly and
[50:40] efficiently to try to take care of these
[50:42] needs and there's it's not brother o L
[50:44] himself that's the one going out he's
[50:46] actually trained brothers to actually go
[50:48] in and so those brothers along with
[50:50] brother ven they're branching out and
[50:52] making their ways into these places to
[50:54] follow up as well so go to the next
[50:56] slide this is the boat the boat itself
[51:00] now you know if I looked at a boat like
[51:02] this there's no way that I'd go out in
[51:03] it they're not gonna go out in a boat
[51:05] like that either but what it is this
[51:07] back in the first part of December there
[51:10] was a storm and then they were actually
[51:12] able to secure this boat and that boat
[51:16] it itself what was already it was
[51:18] already being used and the brothers that
[51:21] are there from Titan palawan they
[51:23] actually are gifted to be able to work
[51:25] with even building a boat they even told
[51:28] me we can build one from scratch if we
[51:30] have the money they're a gifted to work
[51:32] with that fiberglass and things like
[51:33] that so the purpose is this - - actually
[51:37] they're rebuilding this boat right here
[51:39] and it's 1,400 dollars to take care of
[51:43] that that need in order to to get that
[51:45] out and make it usable for the Brethren
[51:47] if you go to the next slide this is just
[51:50] a picture if you remember from when from
[51:52] when we were traveling to the island off
[51:53] of - Liam this is a little bit bigger of
[51:55] a boat obviously and it has the tarp
[51:57] over and things like that but that one
[51:59] is not quite that big but you can kind
[52:01] of see there's it's not plush seats in
[52:03] that boat at all it's a little itty
[52:05] bitty benches and you're looking down
[52:07] through BIM bamboo strips below and you
[52:09] can see the water coming in the boat and
[52:11] how they've kept the pump taking it out
[52:12] so you're just looking at it you you
[52:15] know you don't look at those things you
[52:16] look away
[52:18] and say I'm just trusting the pump we'll
[52:20] take it away but so I don't think I have
[52:23] another slide out their sister Tabitha
[52:25] at all okay yeah so you see them coming
[52:29] into the port there of - Liam Holloman
[52:31] just one of the ports right there and
[52:33] and they usually have these are the
[52:34] boats obviously that where you
[52:36] they taxi them in and out and you've got
[52:38] a couple guys working that that boat
[52:40] that we're looking at to help them be
[52:43] able to obtain that that's something
[52:45] that the brothers themselves will just
[52:47] be taken that boat in around in those
[52:49] mission trips into those islands and
[52:52] things you know the thing is I certainly
[52:54] want to say that we certainly appreciate
[52:56] the faithfulness and what God has
[53:00] allowed us to be able to do what little
[53:01] part that we can have it's it's a
[53:03] blessing that we can even that we can
[53:05] have a little part and you know to them
[53:08] that boat itself well that that boat
[53:10] would be like just imagine maybe
[53:12] somebody here having a Cadillac or
[53:14] something it's what it means to them
[53:16] it's not just a boat but what it means
[53:18] is is that the gospel itself they're
[53:20] gonna be able to cover more territory
[53:22] and getting that in getting the word out
[53:24] so we're just we're thankful for that
[53:26] and you know there's follow-up we know
[53:28] that from the scripture when there's
[53:29] there's the groups that come in and
[53:31] there's such a need for for follow-up
[53:33] and taking them on in into the word and
[53:35] you know you can look at things that
[53:36] will just hand them a book but that that
[53:38] won't in the scriptural way the
[53:39] scriptural way is you go preach the
[53:41] gospel and then you've got men that God
[53:43] would put in there to actually follow up
[53:45] and find out how many times Paul would
[53:47] send Titus and Timothy and different
[53:49] ones what would he send them to do go
[53:51] check up on the churches go see how
[53:52] things are going see how the Brethren
[53:54] are moving along and and I believe with
[53:56] all my heart friends that if as lives
[53:58] are getting really positioned in the
[54:00] word and that message is really taking
[54:02] heart within people's lives I believe
[54:05] that that same angel of the Lord he
[54:06] never left us that same manger the Lord
[54:09] is here to lead us he's he's the one
[54:11] that's directing the Church of the
[54:12] Living God that the the ministry of the
[54:14] Prophet it brought us back to that
[54:16] realization that he's still the same
[54:19] Living God and I'm thankful for that
[54:21] bringing it right back that that as the
[54:24] Holy Spirit himself he is the prophet of
[54:26] the hour aren't you glad for that he is
[54:29] the prophet of the hour he still
[54:31] revealing his word he's still saving the
[54:34] lost he's still filling with the Holy
[54:35] Ghost he's still the same God and you
[54:38] know what we're not getting out of here
[54:39] any sooner until each one that is a part
[54:42] in that Lamb's Book of Life to that last
[54:45] name has been splashed beneath the
[54:48] Clorox bleach we're getting close but
[54:52] until that time we're gonna keep on
[54:54] pressing blood Brent said it like this
[54:56] in 1965 he says he's up in Washington he
[54:59] said I don't know he said that last one
[55:01] might be one over there in Africa he
[55:03] said it might be one over here he said
[55:05] but the church itself will keep slugging
[55:09] along you know slugging along it isn't
[55:13] that everything is it's we're gonna keep
[55:15] pressing there's all kinds of opposition
[55:19] and tide but remember it's not us it's
[55:21] that force behind us God's determined to
[55:25] fulfill his word and he is gonna have a
[55:27] bride he does have a bride amen

[1:00:21] basil or again I want to thank our
[1:00:26] brother for asking us to come in to to
[1:00:28] be with you all and I sure appreciate
[1:00:29] you all
[1:00:31] you're a very easy group of people to
[1:00:32] preach to and I I appreciate that cuz I
[1:00:36] preached in places it's not easy to
[1:00:37] preach he's the Lord you know there's
[1:00:41] just certain things that you have to go
[1:00:43] through sometimes and as a minister
[1:00:44] that's one of the things that you go
[1:00:46] through there's gonna be those times
[1:00:48] when you preach places it yeah they
[1:00:50] don't really like to hear the word
[1:00:52] preached they like to get together they
[1:00:55] have meetings and protracted meetings
[1:00:57] whether bentham said but you know when
[1:00:59] people come together because they love
[1:01:00] the Lord they like to hear the word he
[1:01:03] meant you know there's there was
[1:01:05] something I wanted to say before I have
[1:01:06] everybody standing I'm not good with
[1:01:12] words I prefer to let the Lord just
[1:01:16] anoint and then and then go but you know
[1:01:20] the Browning family has always been a
[1:01:23] just such a special people to us and I
[1:01:27] just really appreciated brother James so
[1:01:30] much the last time that I was with here
[1:01:33] with you he was in the office and we
[1:01:36] were just talking a little bit and he
[1:01:38] looked at me and he said he said well
[1:01:40] Jeff I'm tired and I thought you know I
[1:01:43] understand that but nowhere near like he
[1:01:46] did you know and I looked at him and I
[1:01:49] said brother if it means anything at all
[1:01:51] to you
[1:01:52] I said you're one of my heroes and he
[1:01:55] kind of looked at me and I said brother
[1:01:57] look you were preaching this gospel when
[1:02:00] I was a little sinner boy out there in
[1:02:02] the world I said but you you stood true
[1:02:04] to the word I said many times when
[1:02:05] ministers turned against you because you
[1:02:08] saw the revelation of the word for your
[1:02:09] day I said you still pressed forward and
[1:02:12] you still let a people to Christ and I
[1:02:14] said brother here you're one of my
[1:02:16] heroes and I'd like to say this I really
[1:02:19] believed that he was one of our true
[1:02:20] pioneers of the message and you all that
[1:02:24] have been able to sit under his ministry
[1:02:26] and Samuel you grew up there under
[1:02:28] under him you know you're privileged
[1:02:30] people you're a very privileged people I
[1:02:33] thank God that we have men that we can
[1:02:36] look to like that and it's not just men
[1:02:38] that we have to look back through the
[1:02:39] scripture to see their life but it's men
[1:02:41] that we actually have been able to for
[1:02:43] take up their lives we've been able to
[1:02:45] receive from them what God has done for
[1:02:47] them it's a it's a great privilege in
[1:02:50] this hour to to be a part of the Bride
[1:02:52] of Christ
[1:02:53] I really appreciate our brother and
[1:02:54] certainly certainly have been praying
[1:02:58] for you and praying with you with that
[1:03:01] said let's stand together and let's go
[1:03:03] to Matthew chapter 16 and certainly
[1:03:06] desire your prayers this morning that
[1:03:08] the Lord had just helped me to get out
[1:03:10] of the way and I told brother Samuel I
[1:03:13] felt like an evangelist last night but
[1:03:17] what I'm what is on my heart this
[1:03:20] morning what the Lord has put on my
[1:03:21] heart I I really need to stay in in a
[1:03:24] pastoral frame and I don't know if y'all
[1:03:27] gonna let me do that or not I was just
[1:03:29] listening to the service back there I
[1:03:31] was getting more excited every time
[1:03:33] there's another song was sung and I you
[1:03:35] know I appreciate that at just such a
[1:03:37] wonderful atmosphere in Matthew chapter
[1:03:39] 16 we'll begin in verse 17 and these are
[1:03:42] very familiar scriptures to us but you
[1:03:44] know I believe the Lord can can bring
[1:03:46] things out of them to help us so we know
[1:03:49] this is they come off the mountain Jesus
[1:03:51] had had looked at the disciples and
[1:03:53] asked them said you know who to me and
[1:03:55] say that I am and they had their
[1:03:56] different things to say but he finally
[1:03:58] looked at looked at him he said now who
[1:04:00] do you say that I am and jesus answered
[1:04:03] and said blessed art thou simon barjona
[1:04:05] because Simon had a revelation see he
[1:04:09] had a channel brother mem called it a
[1:04:10] channel open to God and because of the
[1:04:13] channel that had been open to him he was
[1:04:15] able to recognize what was actually
[1:04:17] taking place
[1:04:18] he wasn't just recognizing that Jesus
[1:04:20] was a good preacher he wasn't just
[1:04:22] recognizing that that Jesus had a way
[1:04:24] with people but he said thou art the
[1:04:27] Christ the Son of the Living God and he
[1:04:29] said blessed art thou simon barjona for
[1:04:32] flesh and blood hath not revealed it
[1:04:34] unto thee but my father which is in
[1:04:36] heaven and I say unto thee that thou art
[1:04:40] Peter and upon this rock
[1:04:42] I will build my church and the gates of
[1:04:46] Hell shall not prevail against it now I
[1:04:48] always like to look at a scripture
[1:04:50] exactly the way it's written he said I
[1:04:53] will build my church it's never going to
[1:04:55] be a group of people that builds a
[1:04:57] church although it takes a body of
[1:04:59] believers to be a church praise the Lord
[1:05:01] but under the leadership of the Holy
[1:05:03] Ghost he said I will build my church and
[1:05:06] the gates of Hell shall not prevail
[1:05:08] against him and I will give unto thee
[1:05:11] the keys of the kingdom of heaven and
[1:05:13] whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth
[1:05:15] shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever
[1:05:16] thou shalt loose on earth shall be
[1:05:18] loosed in heaven
[1:05:19] let's bow our heads together you have an
[1:05:23] unspoken request on your heart you won't
[1:05:24] just raise your hand to the Lord he he
[1:05:26] certainly knows every need Heavenly
[1:05:29] Father we stand before you this morning
[1:05:30] or Jesus just so happy to be in the
[1:05:34] house of God so blessed or Jesus to be
[1:05:36] able to stand where we stand today see
[1:05:38] the things that we see Lord we have been
[1:05:41] given eyes to see ears to hear a heart
[1:05:43] to receive Lord we just ask you to come
[1:05:45] today and just take this vessel take the
[1:05:47] gift that you've placed in my life Lord
[1:05:49] and make you be a blessing through the
[1:05:51] word to the people today and Lord may
[1:05:53] you anoint them and help them father to
[1:05:55] be able to receive this word the way
[1:05:58] that it has come to me Lord and helped
[1:05:59] me to just really get out of the way so
[1:06:02] that you can lay this before the people
[1:06:04] so we can actually see little closer
[1:06:06] Lord what's taking place right now at
[1:06:09] this time where we are in this present
[1:06:12] day truth Lord and father will give you
[1:06:15] the praise for it we love you we bind
[1:06:17] every demon power in the name of Jesus
[1:06:19] Christ and we ask you just to move among
[1:06:21] us and have Liberty or in Jesus name we
[1:06:24] pray amen god bless you you can be
[1:06:27] seated
[1:06:27] I want to read verse 18 again he said I
[1:06:35] say unto thee that thou art Peter and
[1:06:40] upon this rock we know that that rock
[1:06:42] was revelation but he says I will build
[1:06:45] my church and the gates of Hell shall
[1:06:47] not prevail against it if you just look
[1:06:50] at the word build and you you know look
[1:06:52] at the definition that's there it does
[1:06:54] say it's to build a house
[1:06:56] to erect a building to bring something
[1:06:57] up but it says it's to bring it up from
[1:07:00] the foundation you realize God is not
[1:07:03] gonna build a church a building anything
[1:07:05] of that nature he's not going to build
[1:07:07] it up without having the right
[1:07:07] foundation under it
[1:07:09] well his foundation is Revelation and
[1:07:11] that's the foundation that every single
[1:07:13] one of us has to stand on because we're
[1:07:15] a part of that church and if our
[1:07:17] relationship is built on anything
[1:07:19] outside of the revelation of God's Word
[1:07:20] then God's going to have to tear it down
[1:07:22] and bring us to a place where we can be
[1:07:24] built by Revelation God said I will
[1:07:27] build my church and the gates of Hell
[1:07:29] shall not prevail against it as long as
[1:07:31] we allow God to build the church then
[1:07:33] the gates of Hell can't prevail against
[1:07:35] it it's not that they won't be against
[1:07:37] it the Prophet said that the gates of
[1:07:39] hell are gonna be against the church but
[1:07:41] he said it can't prevail against the
[1:07:43] church as long as the church stays in
[1:07:45] the revelation of the word that we've
[1:07:46] been given then Satan cannot prevail
[1:07:48] against us
[1:07:49] praise the Lord I'll preach the message
[1:07:52] at home a while back you know said never
[1:07:55] lose a battle I realize that a lot of
[1:07:57] times we hear a statement like that and
[1:07:59] we think but yeah that's impossible it's
[1:08:01] not impossible if you stay behind the
[1:08:03] word if we stay where we're supposed to
[1:08:05] stay the scripture tells us in 1st Peter
[1:08:07] there in the stature of a perfect man if
[1:08:09] these things be in you and abound this
[1:08:12] should cause you to where you shall
[1:08:13] never fall that's what the word says now
[1:08:16] God obligates himself to his word so
[1:08:18] when he speaks the word he puts it out
[1:08:20] there that's just another piece that
[1:08:22] he's putting into the church that's
[1:08:24] something else that he's doing to build
[1:08:25] that church to bring that up to the
[1:08:28] place that he wants it to be Amy now we
[1:08:30] know that before the foundation of the
[1:08:32] world and God had in his mind what he
[1:08:34] wanted the church to me praise the Lord
[1:08:39] this word also means to found or to
[1:08:43] establish something it says to promote
[1:08:46] growth in Christian wisdom affection
[1:08:50] grace virtue holiness blessedness and to
[1:08:55] grow in wisdom and piety hey now that's
[1:08:59] what God said he's gonna build this
[1:09:00] church out of him praise the Lord
[1:09:03] you realize that those are the things
[1:09:06] that are unseen
[1:09:09] heymy our armor is unseen those things
[1:09:13] that are real are unseen those things
[1:09:16] that are most beneficial to us are those
[1:09:18] that are unseen we have to believe by
[1:09:20] faith and faith is a relation so we have
[1:09:23] to walk in Revelation in order for us to
[1:09:25] even be where God wants us to be now you
[1:09:30] probably think I'm changing gears I
[1:09:31] don't know where I'm going but I want
[1:09:33] you to stick with me all right I want us
[1:09:35] to go to Genesis chapter 1 for a minute
[1:09:37] and we're going to start in in verse 1
[1:09:39] and I'm trying real hard to stay in
[1:09:42] pastor mode okay Genesis 1:1 everybody
[1:09:49] knows this we could probably quote it by
[1:09:50] heart you know but in the beginning God
[1:09:53] created the heavens in the earth so
[1:09:56] there was nobody else that was there
[1:09:57] there was nobody to direct him there was
[1:09:58] nobody to tell him how to do it there's
[1:10:00] nobody giving him a better idea but in
[1:10:02] the beginning God created the heaven and
[1:10:04] the earth the earth was without form and
[1:10:07] it was void and darkness was upon the
[1:10:09] face of the deep and the Spirit of God
[1:10:10] moved upon the face of the waters and
[1:10:13] God said let there be light he saw
[1:10:17] others there's nothing so deep about
[1:10:19] that but there is because that's exactly
[1:10:22] the same thing he did to you and I when
[1:10:24] God came to us we were without form and
[1:10:26] void where the darkness was all over up
[1:10:28] and God had to come and bring us out of
[1:10:31] darkness into his marvelous light so
[1:10:33] when we start looking at the scripture
[1:10:35] and we see what God did a God God
[1:10:37] created the heavens and the earth and
[1:10:39] God is actually getting ready to build a
[1:10:41] garden he's going to build what a Garden
[1:10:44] of Eden upon the earth and this is the
[1:10:47] way that God is doing this God said let
[1:10:50] there be light and there was light and I
[1:10:52] blame him said he spoke the word and
[1:10:53] then he had to believe that it was going
[1:10:55] to come to pass now we don't think about
[1:10:58] God had to believe his own word but God
[1:11:00] operates on the same thing we have to
[1:11:02] operate on I know we we don't put the
[1:11:07] Lord there like that but look when Jesus
[1:11:09] was on the earth he didn't use his great
[1:11:11] powers to defeat the enemy he stood on
[1:11:13] the same word that you and I have to
[1:11:15] stand on many of us would never ever
[1:11:17] have the ability within us that Christ
[1:11:19] had in him because he was the fullness
[1:11:21] of the Godhead bodily
[1:11:22] but he didn't go to some supernatural
[1:11:24] power that laid within although it was
[1:11:26] there come on if he can if he can say
[1:11:29] Lazarus comfort and a man had been dead
[1:11:32] for four days jumped up on his faith and
[1:11:34] come walking out of there he could have
[1:11:36] used that power to defeat Satan but he
[1:11:38] didn't he went back to the same thing
[1:11:39] that you and I have to stand on now God
[1:11:42] said I will build this church and the
[1:11:44] gates of Hell will not prevail against
[1:11:46] it God builds by the word they meant
[1:11:49] he's still building by the word God said
[1:11:52] let there be light
[1:11:55] praise the Lord God spoke the word and
[1:11:58] somehow or another that word knew just
[1:12:01] exactly what molecules what atoms
[1:12:03] whatever needed to happen to bring light
[1:12:05] upon the earth God spoke the word and he
[1:12:08] did exactly what it needed to do he
[1:12:11] Solar said God saw the light that it was
[1:12:15] good and he divided the light from the
[1:12:17] darkness
[1:12:18] God saw how good that the spoken word
[1:12:21] was so he realized that I can't allow
[1:12:24] this word to just get mixed up in
[1:12:25] anything so I have to separate it he's
[1:12:29] still separating brother/sister come on
[1:12:32] the final separation is not going to be
[1:12:35] what we think it is a lot of people talk
[1:12:37] about the final separation they want to
[1:12:39] go away over here - the what - the white
[1:12:41] throne judgment where he separates them
[1:12:43] as a sheep from the goat but the final
[1:12:44] separation for the bride is when you can
[1:12:47] separate from you when you can put let
[1:12:50] feel you know see taste feel smell you
[1:12:53] know when you can lay that down when you
[1:12:54] can lay that spirit round now and just
[1:12:56] let God deal with your soul you take
[1:12:59] this word the same way God speaks it and
[1:13:01] you watch it do the same thing in your
[1:13:03] life that it did when God spoke it
[1:13:05] that's a creative power in the Word of
[1:13:07] God praise the Lord God didn't just come
[1:13:10] and use the word so that he could show
[1:13:12] how powerful that he was although it
[1:13:14] shows how powerful that he is come on
[1:13:18] God was setting a precedent this is the
[1:13:22] way I'm always going to build things
[1:13:24] this is the way I always do it he never
[1:13:27] has to change his program he never has
[1:13:29] to change his plate that's why brother
[1:13:31] Branham said when the same circumstances
[1:13:33] are met in the same way God has to move
[1:13:35] the same way that
[1:13:36] did before or he made a mistake the
[1:13:38] first time he doesn't make mistakes so
[1:13:41] he doesn't he'll never change his mind
[1:13:43] come on you know there must have been a
[1:13:46] real mindset of the people in Brother
[1:13:48] bantams day that actually thought God
[1:13:50] changed his mind because of some of the
[1:13:52] thing that was spoken in the work but
[1:13:53] God never changed his mind God just gave
[1:13:56] people an opportunity to go on in their
[1:13:58] own way praise the Lord
[1:14:01] God never changed his mind with Balaam
[1:14:03] he didn't say okay I guess I made a
[1:14:06] mistake and you can go on down there
[1:14:07] he never changed his mind at all he
[1:14:09] didn't want him going down there and he
[1:14:11] did not allow him to curse those people
[1:14:13] prays a lot but Hezekiah god never
[1:14:17] changed his mind
[1:14:18] Hezekiah still died job just gave him a
[1:14:20] little more time on the earth that's
[1:14:21] what he asked for
[1:14:22] but he didn't change his mind at all it
[1:14:24] was Hezekiah time and he was coming you
[1:14:27] understand what I'm trying to say God
[1:14:29] and use this word to build a church and
[1:14:32] he's still building a church and that
[1:14:34] word is not going to change God's not
[1:14:36] going to decide that someday you know
[1:14:38] it's just getting too hard for my people
[1:14:39] down there on the earth and I think I'm
[1:14:41] just going to make it easy for him now
[1:14:45] sister it's not easy to be a Christian
[1:14:47] if it was the whole world to be
[1:14:49] Christians that's right I was listening
[1:14:53] to a brother preach in a funeral one
[1:14:54] time and he was talking about people you
[1:14:56] know they think that and I've heard
[1:14:58] people say it you know people I used to
[1:14:59] work with you know Christianity is just
[1:15:01] for the weak really oh how come you're
[1:15:05] not a Christian
[1:15:09] you know a lot of people want to they
[1:15:11] want to see a real man you know and they
[1:15:13] want muscles that are this big and a guy
[1:15:14] that's six foot eight and all weatherman
[1:15:16] said that's brute but he said a real man
[1:15:19] is measured by his character a real man
[1:15:22] is measured by the bags and the knees of
[1:15:24] his breath where he's been down pray
[1:15:25] talking to his creator
[1:15:27] what man looks at and sees is such a
[1:15:29] great thing God just laughs at it it
[1:15:31] doesn't mean it's foolishness to God but
[1:15:34] it's what man wants to hold on to now if
[1:15:36] you think about it from the standpoint
[1:15:38] that that I'm trying to bring across
[1:15:40] here God has used one element all the
[1:15:43] way through and that's the element
[1:15:44] that'll take us out of here God is using
[1:15:48] his word to build a church and we're a
[1:15:50] part of that church so he's going to use
[1:15:52] that to build us praise the Lord
[1:15:55] if God's Word I said I was going to try
[1:15:59] to stay in pastor mode all right I'm
[1:16:02] slowing down here all right I get ahead
[1:16:07] of myself and I can't help it you know
[1:16:08] because if when inspiration strikes I
[1:16:10] just go with it
[1:16:11] amen everything that God did he did by
[1:16:16] His Word and and that's something that
[1:16:19] if we can really grab ahold of that and
[1:16:21] let that become a part of our daily
[1:16:24] understanding our daily revelation of
[1:16:26] the word now what God does he's going to
[1:16:28] do by the word then we're going to be
[1:16:30] very far from failure we're going to
[1:16:32] stay away from failure because we're
[1:16:34] basing what we do on God's Worth and
[1:16:36] remember Hebrews 13:8 brother man's
[1:16:39] favorite scripture you know he said
[1:16:40] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:16:42] and forever so as long as we're here
[1:16:46] that word that he has used down through
[1:16:47] time that word is what God is going to
[1:16:50] continue to use in Genesis chapter one
[1:16:52] and verse 26 is that God said let us
[1:16:56] make man in our own image after our
[1:16:59] likeness you know I've heard lots of
[1:17:01] people talk about it you know who was
[1:17:03] God talking to I'm glad we had a prophet
[1:17:05] goes by Ben said he was talking those
[1:17:06] things he'd already created it wasn't
[1:17:10] two or three different gods that was up
[1:17:12] there he was just talking to what he had
[1:17:13] already created and he said let us make
[1:17:15] man in her own it he didn't want them
[1:17:17] being out of the picture and not even
[1:17:19] know what was going on so he was
[1:17:21] let's watch what's going on let us make
[1:17:24] man in our image after our likeness and
[1:17:27] let them have dominion over the fish of
[1:17:30] the sea and over the fowl of the air and
[1:17:31] over the cattle over all the earth over
[1:17:33] every creeping thing that creepeth upon
[1:17:35] the earth some God created man in his
[1:17:37] own image and in the image of God
[1:17:39] created he him male and female created
[1:17:42] he them the next verse he said and God
[1:17:45] blessed them and God said unto them be
[1:17:49] fruitful and multiply and replenish the
[1:17:52] earth and subdue it have dominion over
[1:17:54] the fish of the sea over the fowl of the
[1:17:56] air or their every living thing that
[1:17:57] moveth upon the earth here God is
[1:18:00] placing Adam on the earth in dominion
[1:18:03] authority now he's telling Adam multiply
[1:18:08] and replenish the earth so Adams going
[1:18:11] to multiply and replenish the earth and
[1:18:13] he's not around and he's got to do it
[1:18:15] the same way God does upon this rock
[1:18:20] I'll build my church upon this
[1:18:22] revelation of the word I'll build my
[1:18:25] church and the gates of Hell will not
[1:18:26] prevail against it when brother Branham
[1:18:28] was hunting you know him and God begin
[1:18:30] to speak to better man he said what are
[1:18:32] you doing here
[1:18:33] well I'm hunting well how many do you
[1:18:36] need
[1:18:37] he's if brother bear had to believe that
[1:18:39] was God speaking to him and when brother
[1:18:42] Brahim actually preaches perfect faith
[1:18:43] he said God challenged me to take him at
[1:18:47] his word and in faith now listen faith
[1:18:51] is a revelation he said in in faith I
[1:18:53] accepted the challenge I spoke and the
[1:18:56] squirrels were there Adam was born
[1:19:00] straight from the Word of God the very
[1:19:03] mouth of God Adam came forth as spoken
[1:19:06] word we realized this was not man in a
[1:19:08] flesh body that was standing there Adam
[1:19:10] was not created in a flesh body if we go
[1:19:12] to Genesis 2:7 that's where Adam is
[1:19:14] actually brought and placed into a body
[1:19:16] but right here it's something of a
[1:19:18] higher level praise alert now remember
[1:19:22] we're going back and forth with the
[1:19:24] church we're going back and forth with
[1:19:26] what God's desire was God was going to
[1:19:27] build a church let's go back to the
[1:19:29] beginning and look at how God built his
[1:19:31] church in the beginning he did it by the
[1:19:33] Word of God and when the
[1:19:34] came forth then those that came forth
[1:19:36] from the word had the authority to use
[1:19:38] the letter in the same exact manner a
[1:19:41] man and God gave them the right to use
[1:19:44] the word God told him to multiply and
[1:19:47] replenish God told him to have dominion
[1:19:49] but this was a direct order from God
[1:19:53] praise the Lord
[1:19:55] there was nothing out of the way for
[1:19:57] Adam to take charge of the world that he
[1:19:59] was in there's nothing wrong for you to
[1:20:03] take charge of your life by God's work
[1:20:06] there's nothing wrong with you having
[1:20:09] dominion so well I'm a sister you know
[1:20:11] and as history they're supposed to be
[1:20:13] under headship and all that right but
[1:20:14] this body belongs to you come on we all
[1:20:18] have to know how to possess our vessel
[1:20:21] in sanctification and honor and well we
[1:20:24] have a right by God he's given us the
[1:20:26] right to have that Dominion and we have
[1:20:28] authority over the Hat by the Word of
[1:20:30] God the very same way that Adam had an
[1:20:33] authority here we have authority today I
[1:20:35] hadn't used the same thing that God did
[1:20:38] the word we're going to use the same
[1:20:39] thing to praise the Lord let's just look
[1:20:45] at Genesis 2:7 just that one verse that
[1:20:47] said and the Lord God formed man of the
[1:20:49] dust of the ground and breathed into his
[1:20:52] nostrils the breath of life and man
[1:20:54] became a living soul man became the Word
[1:20:58] made flesh he's the Lord it wasn't the
[1:21:02] Word made flesh until then but at that
[1:21:05] time then the word became flesh and when
[1:21:08] the word became flesh the Revelation
[1:21:11] begin to begin to pour forth in a
[1:21:13] different way now Adams got something
[1:21:16] different to work with look remember the
[1:21:21] prophets had God put us in our earthly
[1:21:22] bar in these bodies to contact our
[1:21:25] earthly home now God had created Adam
[1:21:27] put him in the garden to dress it and to
[1:21:29] keep it yes he could dress it according
[1:21:31] to the word yes he could keep it by the
[1:21:33] word but when God put him in a body then
[1:21:35] it was just giving him more to work with
[1:21:37] at the time more to enjoy these
[1:21:41] blessings that God had given him praise
[1:21:45] the Lord
[1:21:47] Genesis 2:18 says and the Lord God said
[1:21:52] it's not good that man should be alone
[1:21:54] I'll make him an help meet for him and
[1:21:57] out of the ground the Lord God formed
[1:21:59] every beast of the field now watch the
[1:22:01] way God skips all this it's not good
[1:22:04] that man should be alone and then he
[1:22:05] says then God formed every beast out of
[1:22:07] the field from out of the ground every
[1:22:09] fowl of the air and he brought him unto
[1:22:11] Adam to see what he would call him and
[1:22:13] whatsoever Adam called every living
[1:22:16] creature that was the name thereof now
[1:22:18] how did Adam know those names
[1:22:19] he had that direct line with God he had
[1:22:22] dominion he had authority so he had a
[1:22:24] right to name those animals and because
[1:22:28] Adam knew where he came from
[1:22:33] I don't knew that he came from the mind
[1:22:35] of God Adam there he was the thought
[1:22:37] there so coming from the mind of God he
[1:22:41] knew what was him the mind of God so
[1:22:43] when an animal came before Adam Adam
[1:22:45] didn't have to say I wonder what that is
[1:22:47] he already had the mind of Christ he
[1:22:51] already knew what was in God's mind and
[1:22:53] he said that's an elephant and God said
[1:22:54] that's exactly right so he met because
[1:22:59] he knew what God's thought was when that
[1:23:01] animal was brought on the earth he
[1:23:03] didn't have to look at an oak tree and
[1:23:05] say I wonder what kind of oak tree there
[1:23:07] is he knew it was an oak tree he
[1:23:09] recognized the acre and that was on it
[1:23:11] he recognized the type of leave that was
[1:23:13] there because in the mind of God when
[1:23:15] the thought was being projected from God
[1:23:17] Adam was there in that projection
[1:23:21] hallelujah I'm trying hard to be a
[1:23:27] pastor y'all help me here okay Adam
[1:23:33] named all of them and and that was the
[1:23:35] name thereof so God didn't change it God
[1:23:38] didn't say Adam you messed up no he left
[1:23:40] it died exactly the way it was is that
[1:23:42] in Adam gave names to all the cattle to
[1:23:44] the fowl of the air to every beast of
[1:23:46] the field but for Adam there was not
[1:23:47] found in hell made for him and the Lord
[1:23:50] caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam he
[1:23:56] put him into a silent
[1:23:59] and he slept and he took one of his ribs
[1:24:03] and closed up the flesh instead thereof
[1:24:09] now in this silence God actually he
[1:24:15] actually goes into the word that's been
[1:24:17] made flesh and he takes a part of this
[1:24:20] word that's been made flesh and brings
[1:24:23] it out of there now Adamson in a deep
[1:24:28] sleep
[1:24:28] so Adam doesn't know exactly what God's
[1:24:31] doing
[1:24:35] praise the Lord God was forming a bright
[1:24:43] Amen now I want you to think about in
[1:24:47] the in the silence in Adams silence God
[1:24:50] was forming the bride but he was
[1:24:52] actually taking a part of Adam to form
[1:24:55] this rhyme
[1:24:55] God did not create something else not
[1:24:59] did not go get something else but God
[1:25:01] went right into the where and pull the
[1:25:03] part of the word out and took that word
[1:25:05] and molded it and shaped it into a bride
[1:25:09] hey Beth verse 22 he says and the rib
[1:25:17] which the Lord God had taken from man
[1:25:19] made he a woman woman means of man and
[1:25:25] he's had any broader under the man I can
[1:25:29] just wonder while all this is going on
[1:25:32] if God said in verse 26 let us make man
[1:25:34] in our own image and after our likeness
[1:25:36] you know let us do it I can wonder you
[1:25:39] know in my mind now I don't have no
[1:25:40] quotes to back this up okay but I'm just
[1:25:43] dramatizing a little bit but I just
[1:25:44] wonder how many of those angels was
[1:25:47] looking over the banister and going I've
[1:25:51] never seen him do this before he just
[1:25:54] speaks it and it happens and then what's
[1:25:57] he what in the world is he gone I don't
[1:26:00] know but it came out of him he got that
[1:26:02] from Adam you mean well what did he kill
[1:26:07] Adam no he said he's still breathing I
[1:26:09] mean you can tell he's breathing over
[1:26:10] there but guitars off Hamlet's what is
[1:26:13] he
[1:26:13] over here now sister we think you know
[1:26:18] what oh that's really a dramatization
[1:26:20] but it's an but you know if you're
[1:26:22] looking at scriptures it says there's
[1:26:24] things that angels desire to look into
[1:26:28] raise the look that was things that
[1:26:31] angels could not come to the earth to do
[1:26:33] there were things that angels were
[1:26:35] created to do and that's all that they
[1:26:37] can do some of those were created to say
[1:26:40] holy holy holy Lord God Almighty holy
[1:26:43] holy holy Lord God Almighty that's what
[1:26:46] they were created to do and they don't
[1:26:48] complain about it they just do it but
[1:26:50] that's what they're created to do they
[1:26:51] don't have anything outside of that that
[1:26:53] they can do please alert but when God
[1:26:57] put Adam on the earth he made Adam just
[1:26:59] like him and what God had the ability to
[1:27:04] do Adam had the ability to do everything
[1:27:08] that God was Adam was so God Himself
[1:27:13] goes into Adam and bring something out
[1:27:15] of Adam that Adam himself maybe didn't
[1:27:18] even realize was there and God has to
[1:27:21] put Adam in this deep sleep so that he
[1:27:23] can go in and pull this thing out of him
[1:27:24] sometimes we don't even want we just
[1:27:27] wondering why he's going on where is God
[1:27:29] but why am I going through this
[1:27:31] situation look he may be bringing
[1:27:33] something out of you to form you into
[1:27:35] what he wants you to be they met when
[1:27:39] the Potter has a vessel upon the wheel
[1:27:41] that vessel that's there does not tell
[1:27:44] that Potter slow down slow down I'm
[1:27:48] getting dizzy you know they don't do
[1:27:51] that come on because when you're on the
[1:27:54] wheel you don't have a voice Amy he
[1:27:59] turns it just as fast as he wants to
[1:28:01] turn it and he slows it down when he
[1:28:03] wants to slow it down if he needs both
[1:28:05] hands on there to squeeze it a little
[1:28:07] bit and to shape it a little he used his
[1:28:09] bow but if he only needs one finger to
[1:28:11] kind of roll the edge he just uses one
[1:28:13] finger remember Jesus he told me he said
[1:28:18] if I cast out Devils by the finger of
[1:28:19] God hood of your son's cast them out by
[1:28:21] so it just takes God's finger to cast
[1:28:24] out the devil he's all you just don't
[1:28:26] know
[1:28:26] circumstance mother says just get the
[1:28:28] finger of god damn and all you gotta do
[1:28:30] is just get the finger of God he said
[1:28:33] brother if I want the fullness if you
[1:28:34] get the finger the rest of it comes with
[1:28:36] it
[1:28:37] hey man don't try to make it so big that
[1:28:40] you can't get to it better sister
[1:28:42] he's more willing to fill us than what
[1:28:44] we've evened is harder on it but the man
[1:28:47] said he wants to give it to us more than
[1:28:48] we wanted he wants us to have the kind
[1:28:51] of relationship that Adam had in the
[1:28:53] garden he wants to bring us into that
[1:28:54] place and what it's not doing in this
[1:28:56] day he's taking this word and molding
[1:28:59] and shaping this ride he's putting her
[1:29:02] in a place he takes the rib and he
[1:29:10] brings him brings the rib to Adam I want
[1:29:15] you to watch what takes place in verse
[1:29:16] 23 Adam immediately knows who she is she
[1:29:27] bets if he was sleeping yeah but that
[1:29:29] was a part of him I want you to think
[1:29:33] about this okay God brought Adam out of
[1:29:38] Adam made of Eve but presented Adam back
[1:29:42] to Adam in feminist form
[1:29:48] praise the Lord
[1:29:49] that's more than intellectual conception
[1:29:51] can understand but it's the truth
[1:29:53] not nonetheless when God comes back and
[1:29:57] presents the woman to Adam the first
[1:29:59] thing he said this is now this is now
[1:30:03] bone of my bone
[1:30:05] this is flesh of my flesh and she shall
[1:30:07] be called woman because she came out of
[1:30:09] me well how did he know she came out of
[1:30:11] him even in the silence it didn't stop
[1:30:15] the revelation from coming forth
[1:30:20] hallelujah better sister just cause
[1:30:22] people say car they do another it does
[1:30:24] emit he's not doing anything it doesn't
[1:30:28] mean the revelation is stopped it has
[1:30:30] never stopped it never will stop God
[1:30:32] still dealing with the people that's in
[1:30:34] that channel of people that he is this
[1:30:37] day presenting the Christ said therefore
[1:30:45] shall a man leave his father and his
[1:30:48] mother and shall cleave unto his wife
[1:30:49] and they shall be one flesh the true
[1:30:53] unity of the word is when we become so
[1:30:55] one with the word that the reflection
[1:30:57] that we have is Christ in feminist form
[1:31:00] whenever Adam preached this message but
[1:31:02] it's history it wasn't so that we would
[1:31:04] be able to talk about what a mighty
[1:31:06] prophet that it was and he was a mighty
[1:31:08] prophet but that's not what God gave him
[1:31:11] gave us a mighty prophet for he didn't
[1:31:13] give them Moses so that they could talk
[1:31:15] about what a great man Moses was he gave
[1:31:17] them Moses to bring them out of their
[1:31:18] bondage to teach them who they were and
[1:31:21] to bring them to the possession that he
[1:31:23] had for them hallelujah God gave us a
[1:31:26] prophet for the same thing to bring us
[1:31:28] out of our bondage to teach us what it
[1:31:31] takes to possess what belongs to and
[1:31:33] then God through that same ministry
[1:31:36] showed that he had come back to the
[1:31:38] earth to lead the church again he moved
[1:31:40] through that same man to speak the word
[1:31:43] to bring things into existence
[1:31:46] well the Balaam said himself he said
[1:31:48] Christ has had more success in my
[1:31:51] ministry than he did his own when he was
[1:31:54] on the earth better been said now I
[1:31:56] didn't say my ministry or he didn't he
[1:31:59] said I didn't say me he said Jesus
[1:32:01] Christ he has had more success in my
[1:32:04] ministries that he's done more signs and
[1:32:06] wonders and miracles right here in
[1:32:08] Jeffersonville then he did the whole
[1:32:10] time that he was on the earth he said
[1:32:11] cuz God finally broke through here but
[1:32:13] there he never could get broken through
[1:32:16] praise the Lord you know the scripture
[1:32:20] says when I return shall I find faith
[1:32:23] what is he looking for is he looking for
[1:32:26] people that believe that he's the Christ
[1:32:28] that died to save us no he's looking for
[1:32:30] people that
[1:32:32] by revelation they're standing they are
[1:32:35] the word for their hour they are what's
[1:32:37] been delivered in this day praise the
[1:32:41] Lord I want you to just think about this
[1:32:44] Eve was a further revelation of Adam
[1:32:50] rizal if you had just stood there and
[1:32:54] looked at Adam in it in his body in male
[1:32:57] form you would have never thought of of
[1:33:00] an Eve all you would have thought of was
[1:33:02] Adam that was standing there all you had
[1:33:04] thought of was you know I saw him the
[1:33:06] other day and you know he called it
[1:33:08] lying over and it came over and just he
[1:33:10] started patting it and talking to it and
[1:33:11] you know now I saw him do this and I saw
[1:33:13] him do that but all the time there was
[1:33:16] something else in there there was so
[1:33:18] much more that was laying in there that
[1:33:20] nobody would have known had God not
[1:33:22] brought that revelation out of him and
[1:33:24] it's such a perfect time for the
[1:33:26] believer today because look he can bring
[1:33:29] out of us what he's already put there I
[1:33:32] preached on the seed one time at home
[1:33:35] and I had a brother that brought me a
[1:33:36] little plaque he said anybody can tell
[1:33:39] you how many apples are on a tree he
[1:33:44] said but nobody or I mean how many seeds
[1:33:46] are in an apple he said but nobody can
[1:33:47] tell you how many apples written in C
[1:33:51] praise the Lord
[1:33:55] you don't know how that seeds going to
[1:33:57] produce when he goes in the ground some
[1:34:00] bring 30 some bring 60 some bring 100
[1:34:02] right but whatever is in that seed is in
[1:34:06] that seed when it goes in the ground and
[1:34:08] if God before the foundation of the
[1:34:10] world placed a seed in us then God knows
[1:34:13] exactly what that seed is going to bring
[1:34:14] forth praise the Lord
[1:34:17] our problem is the ground that it's in
[1:34:21] praise the Lord you know if you don't
[1:34:24] break up the ground brother Jeff we have
[1:34:28] moved past all of these emotional things
[1:34:31] in this hour I'm sorry but you're
[1:34:33] deceived
[1:34:36] that's right weatherman said if you want
[1:34:39] to see God move he said you need a
[1:34:40] broken contrary spirit he's had a broken
[1:34:45] up weepy spirit he said that's what
[1:34:47] creates the atmosphere for birth raise
[1:34:52] the Lord I know that we can become so
[1:34:55] revelaed that you know we have our
[1:34:57] emotions under control my brother let
[1:35:00] somebody bust your toe with a hammer and
[1:35:01] we'll see what kind of emotion control
[1:35:02] you have I'm sorry I hope we don't have
[1:35:08] any English teachers in and I supposed
[1:35:09] to say burst right right soul or
[1:35:14] sometimes you know in the hour that we
[1:35:16] live as a sister we actually have to
[1:35:17] bring it in a form of humor because you
[1:35:20] accept it better that way if the sword
[1:35:24] comes out and just starts cutting
[1:35:26] people just go we're above that we don't
[1:35:30] need nobody brother branham didn't know
[1:35:34] how to preach then that's my example
[1:35:39] that I go back to because he lived in my
[1:35:41] day praise the Lord
[1:35:44] Jesus didn't pull punches and Pat people
[1:35:46] on the back and hand out lollipops and
[1:35:48] suckers and candy he come in and he laid
[1:35:50] the word down
[1:35:51] praise the Lord and those that walked in
[1:35:54] he became the word for their day knows
[1:35:56] that submitting to that word became the
[1:35:59] word for their day hear me what I'm
[1:36:03] going to say they became a further
[1:36:05] revelation of Christ praise the Lord the
[1:36:11] the the greatest thing that we can ever
[1:36:13] do for William Branham is become what
[1:36:16] William Branham preached how many
[1:36:20] believes that John was the messenger of
[1:36:22] the Covenant is that what brother
[1:36:24] Branham said John standing there
[1:36:26] preaching behold the Lamb of God that
[1:36:28] takes away the sin of the world he said
[1:36:31] I must decrease and he must increase his
[1:36:34] disciples hung around for a few days you
[1:36:36] know and a few days later Jesus comes
[1:36:39] walking by again and John said behold
[1:36:40] the lamb of God to go after him
[1:36:45] follow this word John's disciples didn't
[1:36:51] say John we don't want to leave you we
[1:36:54] love you
[1:36:55] John's disciples gave him the greatest
[1:36:58] compliment that they ever could have
[1:36:59] given him they turned and then went
[1:37:01] after the living work they didn't stick
[1:37:04] around with John they didn't keep
[1:37:06] holding on to John's Kotel they didn't
[1:37:08] keep saying whoa John you know what's
[1:37:09] gonna happen are you going to raise up
[1:37:11] again are you gonna do that it wasn't
[1:37:12] that way at all they turn and they went
[1:37:14] right after the Living Word that was the
[1:37:16] greatest compliment that they could've
[1:37:18] ever paid John they believed what he
[1:37:20] preached and then they allowed it to be
[1:37:22] manifested in their lives hallelujah the
[1:37:26] greatest thing that we can do for this
[1:37:28] message by the sister to prove that this
[1:37:31] message is the word that's been laid
[1:37:33] first is let it be made fresh in us
[1:37:35] that's the greatest thing that we could
[1:37:37] ever do to show that he is alive today
[1:37:39] to show that the power of law is just to
[1:37:42] say his to let the power of God have
[1:37:44] preeminence in US he might let the power
[1:37:47] of God when he comes down and begins to
[1:37:49] washing cleanse alive that him washing
[1:37:51] cleanse us amen oh don't pull back on
[1:37:54] him but Daniel told a little story when
[1:37:58] he was at the church last time but
[1:37:59] Daniel 40 from Africa you all know
[1:38:00] brother Daniel well I'm sure he told a
[1:38:03] little story about when they were little
[1:38:05] boys and he said when we were little
[1:38:06] boys he said just like all little boys
[1:38:07] we didn't like to be now older boys
[1:38:13] shouldn't be that way he's the Lord so
[1:38:19] I've got a grandson that's 15 he said
[1:38:20] but I didn't sweat today I don't need to
[1:38:21] take a shower but ender said you know
[1:38:26] because of him being a little boys and
[1:38:28] just wanted to play all the time you
[1:38:29] know he said there was things that got
[1:38:32] into the soil there were diseases that
[1:38:35] got in the soil there were different
[1:38:36] things you know ticks and lice and
[1:38:39] different things and he said they'd get
[1:38:42] in there and they'd get these things on
[1:38:44] them and because they didn't you know
[1:38:46] take a bath and clean up and they'd go
[1:38:48] in and crawl in the bed and they'd get
[1:38:50] him do the same thing the next day just
[1:38:51] like little boys like to do they started
[1:38:54] getting these sores all over he said
[1:38:56] they just pop up all over
[1:38:58] and he said here it went home because
[1:39:01] where he was at he stayed in the
[1:39:02] compound to go to school and on the
[1:39:03] weekends he'd go home so he went home on
[1:39:05] the weekend he said his mother looked at
[1:39:06] him and said what you know how they say
[1:39:09] what she said we can't have this so you
[1:39:13] have not been bad bathing oh but mama no
[1:39:17] you have not been bathing said you go in
[1:39:20] there and get ready he said so my mama
[1:39:22] would go to the market and he said she
[1:39:25] would get a sponge you know he said you
[1:39:26] guys know what sponges or he said they
[1:39:28] have a smooth sponge and a rough sponge
[1:39:31] he said my mother always got the rough
[1:39:33] sponge he said and she would buy
[1:39:37] antiseptic soap and he said and she
[1:39:40] would come back and she would put water
[1:39:42] over the fire and she would heat that
[1:39:44] water up and get it to boiling and just
[1:39:46] get it so hot he said she would take
[1:39:48] that rough sponge and don't have rubbing
[1:39:51] our skin is that I would crimes of all I
[1:39:55] heard so bad it hurts said she never
[1:39:58] cared about my tears she didn't care cuz
[1:40:03] he was in pain she was trying to help it
[1:40:06] he's a lord and after she had scrubbed
[1:40:09] him down and got him to where he felt
[1:40:11] like he was just about to die then she'd
[1:40:13] pour that in a septic soap on there and
[1:40:15] then she'd start scrubbing him again you
[1:40:18] know sometimes you come to service and
[1:40:19] you just get scrubbed and raked over the
[1:40:21] coals and all that kind of stuff you
[1:40:22] know I walked out to service one time
[1:40:25] laid my hand on burned he said don't do
[1:40:26] that brother he said I'm bleeding all
[1:40:27] over you know that mama had a desire
[1:40:35] because knowing what would take place if
[1:40:38] she didn't get in there and get that out
[1:40:41] of his system it would kill him and he
[1:40:44] said God loves us much more than a
[1:40:46] mother could ever love us and he knows
[1:40:48] when there's something in her system
[1:40:49] it's got to come out so if he's got to
[1:40:51] scrub us every service he's going to
[1:40:53] scrub us we're going to be washed by the
[1:40:54] water of the word and we should be so
[1:40:57] thankful for that God doesn't want a
[1:40:59] disease people you know take a lamb back
[1:41:02] there for offering that was a diseased
[1:41:03] lamb come on
[1:41:06] it didn't matter what the people look
[1:41:08] like the man could have been a leper and
[1:41:09] brought an offering and they could have
[1:41:11] said oh you're a leper we can't accept
[1:41:12] not offering but that's not the way it
[1:41:13] was done but I tell ya the man's lamb
[1:41:16] took his place
[1:41:18] [Music]
[1:41:21] God is just so desiring to bring us to a
[1:41:24] place the way the word itself speaks out
[1:41:26] of our lives
[1:41:27] because look a lived sermon always
[1:41:30] speaks louder than any words we could
[1:41:32] ever say right look we can come in here
[1:41:37] and preach like a house on fire on the
[1:41:38] weekend but if you jump in your car and
[1:41:40] you drive down the road and you see me
[1:41:41] pulling into a bar everything I preached
[1:41:43] is null and void because I'm not
[1:41:46] expressing Christ except when I'm behind
[1:41:48] the pulpit preaching the word and the
[1:41:50] gift will operate if there's people
[1:41:52] there to pull on the gift maybe instead
[1:41:54] God will speak to a hypocrite to speak
[1:41:56] to his people
[1:41:57] here's a look I pray we're not no
[1:42:00] hypocrites in here this morning but you
[1:42:02] understand what I'm trying to say God
[1:42:04] wants us so full of the Holy Ghost that
[1:42:06] we we're on display brother sister this
[1:42:10] is the evening time when the token came
[1:42:12] into existence and the token had to be
[1:42:15] put on display it wasn't something that
[1:42:18] they could keep in the house it had to
[1:42:20] be put on the door of the little the
[1:42:22] over and everything everything had to be
[1:42:24] done exactly the way the prophets told
[1:42:26] him to do it had to be laid in order in
[1:42:28] that way because God was expressing to
[1:42:30] Egypt
[1:42:31] these people are separate from you these
[1:42:34] are different these are my people and I
[1:42:36] have come down to deliver them and bring
[1:42:38] them out of here I'm glad God still
[1:42:42] comes down to deliver us and bring us
[1:42:44] out of our our bondages and different
[1:42:46] things the hardest birth that there is
[1:42:49] but his sister is a person that's been
[1:42:51] born and raised in his message you
[1:42:56] pastors in America shaking his head like
[1:42:58] that he had a good Holy Ghost field Mama
[1:43:01] and Daddy but he didn't give him the
[1:43:02] Holy Ghost he had to have it for himself
[1:43:06] he had to have that experience for
[1:43:08] himself you should be so thankful that
[1:43:10] he had a mother and father that told him
[1:43:12] that you know his father being the man
[1:43:15] that he was he could recognize the gift
[1:43:17] that was in his life better man said
[1:43:19] most of the time other people recognize
[1:43:20] the gift long before you do huh he
[1:43:23] couldn't recognize the gift that was in
[1:43:24] his life he could as a Samuel
[1:43:26] you're gonna be a great man you're gonna
[1:43:27] be a great minister of the gospel son I
[1:43:28] want you to take the service Sunday you
[1:43:31] don't even have the Holy Ghost yet you
[1:43:32] gonna put him in a pulpit that's
[1:43:34] contrary to what our prophet taught us
[1:43:35] come on I know brother James wasn't that
[1:43:39] way better James was one of those
[1:43:40] minutes it's not let's pray let's get in
[1:43:43] the presence of God if that gift is ever
[1:43:46] gonna operate God's gonna have to
[1:43:47] operate it if it'll ever be a blessing
[1:43:49] to anybody God's gonna have to make it a
[1:43:51] blessing you need the Holy Ghost son
[1:43:53] raise the Lord Frey's we need more
[1:43:55] parents to teach your children now not
[1:43:57] patting them on the back and tell them
[1:43:58] how wonderful they are they never make
[1:43:59] mistakes we all make mistakes at least
[1:44:04] most of us raise your hand last night
[1:44:05] when I asked come on I don't think I'm
[1:44:12] being a pastor right now
[1:44:15] can I change gears for a minute can we
[1:44:17] go to numbers chapter three from it
[1:44:23] somebody is really pulling so brother
[1:44:27] when you get ready you want me to stop
[1:44:28] just tell me I usually give them
[1:44:33] opportunity home to say hey man at least
[1:44:34] once and I say that's all it takes
[1:44:37] numbers chapter 3 and verse 5 oh I want
[1:44:40] to just look at something for me said
[1:44:41] the Lord spake unto Moses saying bring
[1:44:44] the tribe of Levi near and present them
[1:44:49] that's the same thing that God did he
[1:44:51] brought Eve and presented her to Adam
[1:44:55] now here he's teaching the ministry in
[1:44:58] that day bring this tribe up and present
[1:45:01] them to the high priest he said present
[1:45:04] them before Aaron the priest that they
[1:45:06] may minister unto me O God what a
[1:45:10] privilege Prince
[1:45:11] what a privilege that we have we had
[1:45:13] been given opportunity to minister to
[1:45:15] the king of kings and the Lord of lords
[1:45:17] we've been given opportunity to do
[1:45:19] something for him that would bless him
[1:45:22] raise the Lord he blesses us all the
[1:45:24] time he's constantly pointlessness son
[1:45:27] out here it's a beautiful thing I love
[1:45:30] it when the Sun shines it blesses the
[1:45:32] whole world but God set it for us the
[1:45:35] blessing is for the Bride of Christ they
[1:45:37] just happen to be a beneficiary of our
[1:45:39] blessing the rain falls on the just and
[1:45:42] the unjust but it's for the just right
[1:45:47] he said verse 7 says and they shall keep
[1:45:51] his charge and the charge of the whole
[1:45:53] congregation before the tabernacle of
[1:45:55] the congregation to do the service of
[1:45:57] the tabernacle he's calling them for a
[1:46:00] purpose he said they shall keep all the
[1:46:02] instruments of the tabernacle of the
[1:46:04] congregation in the charge of the
[1:46:05] children of Israel to do the service of
[1:46:07] the tabernacle and thou shalt give the
[1:46:10] Levites and entire people with him said
[1:46:13] that was the bride all right he said the
[1:46:16] Levites was the bride he said they shall
[1:46:18] give the Levites unto Aaron and to his
[1:46:20] sons they are wholly given unto him out
[1:46:23] of the children of Israel oh my he came
[1:46:27] and he presented them a gift as it were
[1:46:30] and the gift was a people just as God
[1:46:36] brought Eve to Adam that was a gift to
[1:46:39] Adam and the gift was a further
[1:46:40] revelation of who he was Isaiah chapter
[1:46:46] 7 verse 14 it said therefore the Lord
[1:46:48] himself shall give you a sign behold a
[1:46:50] virgin shall conceive and bear a son and
[1:46:52] shall call his name Immanuel God telling
[1:46:55] them I've got a gift on the way I'm
[1:46:57] bringing something to you
[1:47:01] Isaiah 9:6 I'm gonna run scriptures for
[1:47:04] a minute okay under us a child is born
[1:47:06] unto us a son is given the government
[1:47:08] shall be upon his shoulder his name
[1:47:10] shall be called wonderful counselor the
[1:47:12] mighty God the everlasting father the
[1:47:14] Prince of Peace of the increase of his
[1:47:16] government and peace there shall be no
[1:47:18] end upon the throne of David and upon
[1:47:20] the kingdom to order it and to establish
[1:47:22] it with judgment and with justice from
[1:47:24] henceforth even forever the zeal of the
[1:47:27] Lord of hosts will perform this God
[1:47:29] again dropping the word in there the
[1:47:32] Messiah is on his way and God taking the
[1:47:34] word and building that body
[1:47:37] amen everything he said in those
[1:47:39] scriptures said this is what he's going
[1:47:41] to be when he gets here I'm taking my
[1:47:43] word and I'm building this tabernacle
[1:47:45] but I'm gonna leave him praise the Lord
[1:47:49] now under the inspiration of those
[1:47:52] prophets it was
[1:47:53] spoken word spoken word spoken word it
[1:47:57] was the thought of God that had been
[1:47:58] projected a prophet had been caught up
[1:48:00] to catch the thought of God and it was
[1:48:02] God projecting the revelation of the
[1:48:03] word to the people but as long as it
[1:48:05] stayed has spoken word they couldn't
[1:48:07] have the fullness of the revelation oh
[1:48:12] my we can say bread man said babe and
[1:48:15] said brother BAM said brother and said
[1:48:17] but it's different when God says it to
[1:48:19] you it's different when it's made flesh
[1:48:21] in you it come becomes a completely
[1:48:24] different book the message is completely
[1:48:27] different when you realize you're a part
[1:48:28] of this man message
[1:48:29] you're a manifestation of what this
[1:48:31] prophet said in Luke chapter 2 verse 11
[1:48:35] and said unto us or underused is Born
[1:48:38] This Day in the City of David a savior
[1:48:39] which is Christ the Lord and this shall
[1:48:41] be a sign unto you you shall find the
[1:48:43] babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying
[1:48:45] in a manger and suddenly there was with
[1:48:47] the angel a multitude of the heavenly
[1:48:49] hosts praising the heart and saying
[1:48:52] glory to God in the highest and on earth
[1:48:54] peace and goodwill toward men
[1:48:55] the word just became flesh praise the
[1:48:59] Lord
[1:49:00] we don't think about it we just see a
[1:49:03] baby in a manger brother BAM said it
[1:49:08] ought to be striking Jehovah in a manger
[1:49:12] Jehovah over a manure pile Jehovah
[1:49:15] crying like a baby and he said but
[1:49:18] that's what it was God had been made
[1:49:21] flesh on the earth yeah I want to read
[1:49:28] you a quote from we have seen his star
[1:49:29] and have come to worship Him
[1:49:30] brother band says he said notice as we
[1:49:34] go along he said now I won't take too
[1:49:36] long or try not to when I hear him say
[1:49:38] that I thank you Lord I'm glad he put
[1:49:39] that in there he said notice we find
[1:49:42] going along Jesus he said now the
[1:49:45] children won't understand it but I want
[1:49:46] to I want to say it here for you adults
[1:49:48] when Christ Jesus was being formed in
[1:49:51] Mary that's when the persecution said in
[1:49:54] praise Allah he said that's right that's
[1:49:58] when her persecution started see and
[1:50:00] it's the same thing in you he's at
[1:50:03] Genesis 4 he says Galatians 1 and then
[1:50:06] he says Galatians 4 9
[1:50:07] Tencent when Christ the hope of glory is
[1:50:10] formed in you see Christ is being formed
[1:50:13] in year and when you're dying in Christ
[1:50:15] is coming to life watch the persecution
[1:50:18] said watch the struggles come on
[1:50:22] what's the battle increase he's a lord
[1:50:26] he said watch the persecution say watch
[1:50:29] trouble start on every head watch the
[1:50:31] devil go on a rampage certainly Christ
[1:50:34] is being formed in you oh my that ought
[1:50:38] to make you feel so much better about
[1:50:39] the trial that you're going through
[1:50:40] right now come on better sister look you
[1:50:44] know whether Christ has been formed in
[1:50:46] you or not you know whether what you're
[1:50:48] going through or not is your fault or
[1:50:49] not if it's your fault don't blame it on
[1:50:52] God just repent and get back to a place
[1:50:54] where he can continue to form himself in
[1:50:56] you it's that simple
[1:50:58] God's not mad at you because you fell on
[1:51:00] your face when you backs littering there
[1:51:01] like that he loves you just to say and
[1:51:03] he's always there to reach a hand out to
[1:51:05] us he's always there to bring us back
[1:51:07] into his presence praise the Lord
[1:51:10] when the word begins to become flesh
[1:51:15] then the persecution sets in praise the
[1:51:19] Lord even for a child that's being born
[1:51:22] on the earth when the child is still in
[1:51:25] the mother a child doesn't worry about
[1:51:27] anything all of its nourishment is there
[1:51:30] everything that it needs is right there
[1:51:32] it doesn't worry about breathing it
[1:51:35] doesn't worry about blood pumping
[1:51:36] through its pain it doesn't worry about
[1:51:38] any of those things it's all there it's
[1:51:40] it's self-contained if you will but you
[1:51:43] know as soon as that child is born the
[1:51:44] first thing that happens is you know
[1:51:48] better man said sometimes it's just the
[1:51:49] shock of being born that makes them cry
[1:51:52] out like that you know what I'm gonna
[1:51:56] say right where the band said a child
[1:51:59] that's born without any noise is dead he
[1:52:05] said it's stillborn right he said what
[1:52:08] does the doctor have to do he said the
[1:52:10] doctor has to pick it up and give it a
[1:52:12] little posterior protoplasmic
[1:52:13] stimulation and he said and it begins to
[1:52:15] cry out
[1:52:17] and he said in unknown tongues to itself
[1:52:20] I guess praise the Lord
[1:52:24] come on little sister I still believe in
[1:52:27] a real genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:52:30] and many feelings after that they met
[1:52:34] it's not a one-time experience that's
[1:52:37] going to take me all the way through
[1:52:39] it's an everyday experience that'll take
[1:52:41] me all the way through he meant it's
[1:52:44] something that we've got to have every
[1:52:46] single day of our lives
[1:52:49] mm-hmm I quoted some of this last night
[1:52:53] but I want to read it to you real quick
[1:52:55] out of Matthew chapter 2 and verse 10 he
[1:52:56] said when they saw the star speaking of
[1:52:58] those major you know what we call the
[1:53:00] wise men when they saw the star they
[1:53:02] rejoiced with exceeding great joy and
[1:53:04] when they were come into the house they
[1:53:07] saw the young child with Mary his mother
[1:53:08] and fell down and worshiped him and when
[1:53:10] they had opened their treasures they
[1:53:12] presented unto Him gold frankincense and
[1:53:16] myrrh now I want you to watch the word
[1:53:20] was made flesh and God had those men
[1:53:24] testified on the earth that that child
[1:53:27] was what he said that he was gold
[1:53:31] frankincense and myrrh deity in service
[1:53:34] to die
[1:53:35] that's what better man said it stood for
[1:53:37] gold was the deity frankincense was the
[1:53:39] service myrrh was the bitter death he
[1:53:42] was going to die he said deity in
[1:53:44] service to die so God coming to the
[1:53:48] earth had himself presented with what
[1:53:51] would reflect him oh god I hope we can
[1:53:58] really catch what I'm trying to say by
[1:53:59] the sister what we're in the I don't
[1:54:01] know how long I've been preaching but
[1:54:02] right now I really don't care hey man
[1:54:05] we're in the hour of presentation better
[1:54:10] sister we're in the hour the rapture is
[1:54:12] at head Bela madam said that seven times
[1:54:15] seven times its completion the rapture
[1:54:18] is it head the time appointed
[1:54:21] is it head Billy Graham has gone home
[1:54:24] there's nothing there for Sodom anymore
[1:54:26] it's time for the bride to leave
[1:54:29] christ has descended the Lord Himself
[1:54:31] descended from heaven with a shout and
[1:54:33] what is he doing he's taking that word
[1:54:36] that's been made flesh God has come down
[1:54:38] not into this brother feminist phone and
[1:54:41] he's actually presenting this Living
[1:54:43] Word back to Christ
[1:54:47] it's presentation time brother Branham
[1:54:51] told us God was building a masterpiece
[1:54:53] you can't be a masterpiece unless you're
[1:54:56] a piece of the master hallelujah it's
[1:55:01] time that the presentation is taking
[1:55:04] place a may if God can speak and say let
[1:55:08] there be in their laws then God said let
[1:55:11] there be a bride and there is a man he
[1:55:13] said let the word come forth and it has
[1:55:15] let my word live and it is hallelujah
[1:55:19] you believe that this morning let's just
[1:55:23] stand to our feet I think this is a good
[1:55:25] time to just worship praise the Lord the
[1:55:29] presenting of the bride the time when
[1:55:32] God has come down and taken this very
[1:55:34] word that he's built this church with
[1:55:36] and presenting it back to Christ he so
[1:55:39] been Jeff I'd sure like to have some
[1:55:40] quotes on that wall there's plenty of
[1:55:42] them there I'm just on about page three
[1:55:47] there's plenty of those things there
[1:55:49] brother Bantam even said in the
[1:55:51] masterpiece that this bride was the
[1:55:53] masterpiece that God was creating he
[1:55:55] said it over and over and over what God
[1:55:57] was doing and spoken word his original
[1:55:58] said brother Branham actually said that
[1:56:00] God will come and he will actually take
[1:56:02] a bride and he will present that bride
[1:56:04] to his son Jesus Christ amen
[1:56:07] but says I don't I don't think that we
[1:56:10] have to have quote after quote after
[1:56:11] quote after quote after quote if we'll
[1:56:13] just look at what God's done in our
[1:56:14] lives if we'll just look at the molding
[1:56:16] and the shaping that he's done in our
[1:56:18] own life where he's brought us from to
[1:56:20] where we are right now and what's he
[1:56:22] doing come up here
[1:56:23] don't come up into my presence you're
[1:56:26] under an eagle anointing come up out of
[1:56:28] Laodicea we're in the bride age now come
[1:56:31] up here to a place where I can give you
[1:56:33] a further revelation raise the Lord what
[1:56:38] greater revelation can we have with a
[1:56:40] sister then we belong to him we're a
[1:56:41] part of him
[1:56:42] there's no devil in hell that can stop
[1:56:44] you from being there it's the wired
[1:56:48] being made fresh for the sister that
[1:56:51] defeats Satan on every head when the
[1:56:53] word becomes a part of you and you and
[1:56:55] that wire become what but a madam said
[1:56:57] you'd become what you I think I quoted
[1:57:00] it last night but your beginning is
[1:57:02] you're in and if you started with God
[1:57:05] then you're going back to God
[1:57:06] hey bear but what's he doing he's got a
[1:57:09] ministry in this hour
[1:57:10] he's got men that are anointed of the
[1:57:12] Holy Ghost that are coming in here and
[1:57:14] even in the midst of our trials the
[1:57:15] midst of our circumstances the midst of
[1:57:17] our faults and failures in shortcoming
[1:57:19] he's lifting us up and showing us a
[1:57:22] mirrored image of Christ in us Christ in
[1:57:27] you the hope of glory praise all our
[1:57:32] power heads together
[1:57:34] Oh father
[1:57:40] I know sometimes I just get so excited
[1:57:42] Lord and I maybe I just skipped over too
[1:57:45] many things that I didn't need too long
[1:57:46] it's not my desire to wear your people
[1:57:49] out Lord but if we can just really catch
[1:57:52] what was spoken it's going to transform
[1:57:56] our lives or we're gonna go out of here
[1:57:58] we're gonna be different people than we
[1:58:00] were when we came in in here we're gonna
[1:58:02] go out of here and we're going to look
[1:58:03] at ourselves in a different way we've
[1:58:07] come to that place for that we need to
[1:58:10] be like Esther when there came a threat
[1:58:13] against Esther Lord Esther invited the
[1:58:17] devil to the banquet Esther invited the
[1:58:20] problem before the king hallelujah Oh
[1:58:24] God give us enough spiritual revelation
[1:58:28] and spiritual strength this morning Lord
[1:58:30] to bring our problems to bring our
[1:58:32] circumstances to bring our enemy before
[1:58:35] you this morning Lord God hallelujah
[1:58:39] the king gave Esther the right not to
[1:58:44] change the word but just put that word
[1:58:53] in a place to where it would benefit her
[1:58:56] and it would destroy her enemy Oh God
[1:59:02] I believe today Lord Jesus she's giving
[1:59:04] us the word you've placed the word
[1:59:06] within us but you placed it upon our
[1:59:08] lips also that would defeat our enemy
[1:59:11] I pray you're helpless father I pray
[1:59:15] that you really really help us to see
[1:59:17] the revelation of what's been preached
[1:59:20] this morning Lord
[1:59:21] not because I think I'm a rebel ated
[1:59:23] person but Lord God what Adam was was
[1:59:28] presented back to Adam what laid there
[1:59:32] all that time was presented back to Adam
[1:59:35] learn the Prophet said when you hung on
[1:59:38] Calvary Lord they drove that spear
[1:59:41] through your side he said out came blood
[1:59:43] and water and he said the bride was born
[1:59:47] there at Calvary now Lord you closed up
[1:59:50] the side of Adam and Eve could never get
[1:59:52] back in there again but the side of
[1:59:55] Christ was never closed because our
[1:59:58] perfection is in Christ without Christ
[2:00:00] we can't even be perfected without the
[2:00:03] anointed Word will never become what
[2:00:04] we're supposed to become so you left
[2:00:06] that off so that our identification
[2:00:10] would be in our husband our
[2:00:12] identification would be in that anointed
[2:00:15] word it would be in our second death as
[2:00:17] the second II identify the feminist form

[2:00:39] our hearts Lord
[2:00:40] it'll be able to have full preeminence
[2:00:43] in our lives
[2:00:45] oh Jesus I just I ask your blessing to
[2:00:49] be upon my brother Samuel today Lord
[2:00:51] upon this little church Lord Jesus every
[2:00:54] person that comes to this church Lord

[2:01:21] Jesus Christ be placed between them and
[2:01:24] the enemy that would try to destroy them

[2:01:30] there's a group of people on the earth
[2:01:31] that is raised up in the midst of
[2:01:33] Satan's Eden under an anointing Lord

[2:01:39] still gonna be overcomers father they're
[2:01:41] still gonna believe the word there's
[2:01:43] still gonna be a manifestation of Jesus
[2:01:46] Christ in this hour help us oh god help
[2:01:50] us Lord Jesus to stay in that channel

[2:31:47] [Music]
[2:31:50] to hear what the Holy Spirit would say
[2:31:53] to us to think of the word that he spoke
[2:31:58] to us just what what was spoken right
[2:32:00] here on the platform this morning that
[2:32:03] it's him that cleanses us and you know
[2:32:07] there's sometimes how God is so merciful
[2:32:10] he's so mindful this is his love brother
[2:32:14] brems says if it was up to me I gave you
[2:32:17] my body he said I gave you the word if
[2:32:19] you couldn't believe that that would be
[2:32:20] enough he said but God God's love don't
[2:32:24] get this too loud
[2:32:25] turn it down God's love he said his
[2:32:28] Reach is so great to where he said
[2:32:30] there's five ministerial gifts that's
[2:32:33] his love he says and then if we still
[2:32:36] don't get it he said he's got nine
[2:32:39] spiritualness
[2:32:41] you see how God's desire it's God's
[2:32:45] determination it's not ours
[2:32:47] it's his so if he's that determined and
[2:32:51] to be able to just speak it out so
[2:32:53] clearly that that he is the cleanser
[2:32:56] that come unto me that I will cleanse
[2:32:59] you by his word amen so I say this
