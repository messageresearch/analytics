good to have brother M with us and um we are um just grateful that uh for the ministry here brother Jerry my goodness that was um I I tell you the services were such a blessing and um from I think I don't know how many of you know but you know for ourselves we were actually supposed to be gone my family and I uh to minister there in Texas and New Mexico and uh so we had to cancel all that after the first Sunday um with for a trip that had been planned for about a year but God knows and so um you know with all that I was just thankful uh I was thankful I was able to be here and I was thankful to just rest and the Lord knows that uh that we needed that as much as you can get and uh but I just I so appreciated just the ministering of the word that was here just such such quality and of services that the Lord had given us and we certainly want to remember brother neran sister Mina as they're on their way back home uh God would just watch over them I that rain I don't know if anybody had to come in when that rain was falling out here but uh I trust you didn't that rain was that was really coming down so um but we want to remember them in prayer the Lord would be with them I also want to ask you to remember uh brother Nathan Bryant in prayer um they he landed there in Finland yesterday and he's got uh quite a few services in just a few days and so uh he's already started kind of hit the ground running so we wanted to just remember brother Nathan in prayer would you do that just even in your uh time of praying there at home that the Lord would just uh be with our brother and just guide those meetings that are there uh also want to mention brother George Smith Lord willing will be here on Sunday and uh so so thankful to have brother George that uh to come by our way and so we uh also are planning on the fire pit Fellowship ship and you know the Lord willing that uh we do what we can and trying to look and observe and I tell you I don't know uh this time of this year there's been so much sickness all around as a matter of fact just to let you know the meetings that I was supposed to go to uh three of one myself and two other brothers cancelled and from different parts of the of the country just simply because of of sickness but it's nothing to be alarmed about but it's just something that we realize that here we are we're in the middle of summer and you're you know you're dealing with these things and so um we just want to remember uh brother George in prayer as he comes uh to minister and so we're looking forward to that and thank you musicians amen and amen so appreciate that and man what a wonderful atmosphere to walk into uh I just you just sense the atmosphere you know that's that's back there and I I mentioned I felt kind of bad I mentioned a few weeks ago I was I was glad you know I welcomed Paul back up here because it had been a month because of just being able to get back and sing and and things like that but I wanted to say in the meantime I so appreciated brother Brian just standing right there just faithful just service after service and when he was counting on Paul leading and Paul had to call him up and say uncle Brian you got to take it tonight you got to take it on Sunday and so I appreciate that and then my goodness wasn't that uh wasn't that special to have uh one of the veterans back in leading songs there the other time I tell you what that was that was a real treat real treat I tell you what uh you know a lot of times I'll say with a lot of the song leaders and I don't mean to keep you standing but uh you know at times I told with Brother Bill and I talked with the S other song leaders I said at times I said I need you to we need to just have some times because some of the song leaders I said they've never experienced the things that you've experienced they brother Bill LED songs without any music and a lot of things when the church was just a beginning and but you know you appreciate that that faithfulness and through it all and and so it just is um we so appreciate that sometimes words is just not enough but we we love you brother Bill amen so appreciate you Amen to me nobody can sing hymns like brother Bill nobody nobody I love the other brothers and song leaders but brother Bill just he he's with that of the hymns and I love when he sings that North silver no gold don't you love that oh I love that song uh let's just look into the word I could talk to you all night but uh let's look here into the word in verse 13 and uh probably praying that I don't preach all night verse 13 of job 23 uh job says but he is in one mind I want you to notice these words we've we've we started out with some of this uh thought within this and I want you to notice what what what job is speaking here he says but he is in one mind and who can turn him and what his soul desireth even that he doeth for he performeth the thing that is appointed for me and many such things are with him therefore am I troubled at his presence when I consider I am afraid of him for God maketh my heart soft and the almighty troubleth me because I was not cut off before the darkness neither hath he covered the darkness from my face amen may God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated you know we had been looking for a few services on that uh the beginning there of of of of job and dealing with that one with uh fear and knowing that worry and fear are very related um you know brother branam takes us there in the message I have heard but now I see and um that message you know I've quoted from there a lot that's where a lot of it where when I look of through the Book of Job and looking at that through that message um you see that it was it was job not getting an answer from God as to what was going on and that was that was worrying him the prophet said and brother Braham says when you get in that kind of a fix you're in a bad shape because that's just exactly where the enemy wants to get us to push us to where something moves from a concern to a worry but I I look at this in the scripture you and I are privileged in this hour that uh since the coming of the Holy Spirit and then to stand in the hour that we are living in and uh like brother Jerry was referring to that scripture on Sunday and that we are looking through a glass Darkly but then we shall see face to face and we recognize that it's things that God is continuing to open our understanding and I'll say it this way he wants to continue to open our understanding because when as our understanding is opened it it brings us stability within our lives it's things that we can see and to understand doesn't mean that we know all the inner workings but it's to it's to see what God's desire is and God's purpose and to really see ourselves as God sees us and to also see ourselves in the light that in everything we can do nothing without him and so when job is looking at at all of this in the scriptures remember that that Revelation as far as what would become of man after man would die that had not broke forth yet and job uh when he said for the thing which I greatly feared has come upon me job looked at the situation that he was in and remember he said it was like that of a tree that was cut down wherein that I don't see any hope I see no recover y I see nothing coming out of this but yet God in the midst of it all was actually going to bring one of the most glorious Revelations to job's life and a revelation that would be a very glorious Revelation in the middle of the book and at the end of the book and that would be I know my redeemer liveth because when you watch how brother Brandon will take that that in the scripture that's job 19 but if you watch watch how brother Brandon will apply that scripture he will tie that scripture in to a final conclusion of when God takes job Clear back before the foundation of the world and so we see it in this way that it's God revealing himself from Genesis to Revelation it's God showing us that as he's come in the volume of the book he's also the same God at the end time he is Our Redeemer revealed and manifest in this end time as a matter of fact that's the real that's the comfort and security of the believer in this hour not this world when you even get your mind on the things that you see and you hear that can be very troubling if that's what you're looking to but oh I'm glad that there's something that's beyond what we see around us I'm grateful that there is a hope that lith within us and that's the hope we give reason for the hope that lies within us this is why I do this this is why the decision I make this is why I forsake this this is why I turn this way is because the coming of the lord The Rapture means more to me than anything else it's it's not when it comes to being weighed in the balance there's nothing that compares to that so when we're looking at this here in the scripture I want to just I want to just take this approach with us tonight I want to build towards something that perhaps we'll get into next week but I want to deal with this part on it and this is maturity being reflected in our thoughts maturity being reflected in our thoughts because many times the things that we we look at throughout life and the way that sometimes that we can even interpret situations interpret things of others or what someone you know says or maybe even how they look or or something and what I mean by look not just how they look in appearance but sometimes actions and things you know we can interpret it in a certain way it's just like Satan could come right here well I'm standing ministering and he would like to tell me so and so this does disagrees this and so and so this say you know why to try to get things off track and this is why that even when brother BR I think he preaches one of the messages on blind bmus he said Satan wore me out in the hotel room telling me that the people aren't going to get this thought tonight so sometimes our perceptions are are are are a lot of times can be based upon previous things that we've encountered or seen or experienced and this is why that even after the New Birth has come this is why that the word comes to first of all give us a Dominion that we might be able to release and submit our lives that the word might wash us this is why there must be a renewing of our mind and this is where God comes to change even our perceptions on things to where that we can see it the way God sees it and this is where we need the help of almighty God and so we want to take the word that's what I want to take I believe that's what you want to take I I want to take just like what I think brother Jerry preached on that first service when you take a thinking man's filter and you apply it across the board it doesn't stop with just the change of our nature that thinking man's filter is the word and we filter everything through the word of God if it can't make it through the word of God I don't want it that includes my attitudes that includes my thoughts that includes anything I want to filter it through the word because whatever is filtered through the word the end result the only thing that can pass through the word is the spirit of God because that is the word and that's what this is this is why that when that that is presented to you and I it's the benefit for our lives as a Believer to realize the source that we have of the m and the maturing that it would become reflected in our thoughts as it passes through the word now I want you to think of this here out of three kinds of Believers I've referred to this quote many times but it's it's a very much a key what brother Bram says concerning job as long as Satan can make him believe that his sickness was his God doing it he had job whipped now let me just just put this in context even though he is believing that it's God doing it Satan is handing this to him but it doesn't change one fact that he's still a Son of God it doesn't change one thing that he still has a revelation from God that he knows where he's standing see you know what that tells me that you or I there's times where we can be wrong in our thinking and it shows that even though we've got a revelation that is prevailing in our heart but if we allow thoughts to come into our mind and take those thoughts it can actually stifle the Revelation from moving and prevailing in our lives this is why that when we have all of we see that with Revelation there's nothing it's trueth as the prophet said as great and prevailing as Revelation that's absolute truth Jesus said Upon This Rock I'll build my church but this is why that even within that we need to let the word oh God let the word have the right away in my life Lord I want the word to have the right away I don't want to I don't want to compare it with other things I want the word to have the right away notice he said as long as Satan can make him believe that his sickness was his God doing it he had job whipped it wasn't God doing it it was Satan doing it and he said the same thing today he'll try to tell you these trials and things is your God trying to put punishment upon you it isn't no sir it's Satan doing it God permitting it that's key it's Satan doing it but God permitting it and listen he's not the author of confusion God is the god of purpose notice and why is he doing it to temper you to temper you to make you see if you are tied to this earth notice it's not to make God see it's not even to make the devil see it's for you and I to see that what really matters in my life is coming out under a test or under a trial yeah that's what's really coming out that's what the test is comes to do it comes to mold you and I to shape you and I as we surrender but it comes to let you know there's something great Gater than you there's something greater than your resiliency it's the purpose of God in your heart and in your life oh my it's to temper you now those of you that work and have worked at the steel mill or other places you know what tempering is tempering itself is so that that metal can be used in a later time and the way it's done is is they heat it up to the point right Where It's At The Fringe of melting yeah and then they'll cool it down oh yeah they keep doing that because what that does is it it allows that then to become a usable source that steel that metal that iron it allows it to become usable and this is how that God molds and shapes us he'll take us to the very degree before melting before we would melt and then God comes right around and lets us just cool right off and have what's he doing it's hardening and making us and building an elasticity something to where we're able to be molded and shaped for his purpose absolutely I don't know about you but I probably would say Lord just less than mine 20° because listen your flesh and my flesh it it doesn't it doesn't see this and it doesn't matter like even what's being preached tonight you know who's really rejoicing in in us not your flesh not my flesh it's that inner man on the inside that's rejoicing because it's that inner man that's a part of the word of God you see friends that's why even the coming of the Holy Ghost the coming of the Holy Spirit yeah I can anoint our flesh yes it can anoint our spirit but it didn't come to anoint our flesh and spirit it came to Quicken that seed on the inside and bring forth a real new birth that's what it came to do Hallelujah yes sir so to temper us and I want to go right into Romans chapter 5 and notice how Paul would would refer to this in Romans 5 and he would say that being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in Hope of the glory of God this is our expect ation the glory of God from Glory unto Glory until the very change is that right and not only so but we glory in tribulations also I know we can look at that scripture that doesn't mean in verse three and I hope you understand I'm just going to use an illustration that doesn't mean that necessarily we're running around the church or or you know we're we're you know doing cartwheels but what it means is that the glory in tribulation is where we remain worshiping the Lord in the midst of it all I don't understand it even in your mind or in your spirit there might be a weariness but we're presenting ourselves before him that's a maturing being reflected in our thoughts in other words God's not against me he's for me amen he sought me out Hallelujah I didn't find the message the message found me right I didn't reveal myself to to the Lord Jesus he came and sought me out he revealed himself to me I didn't clean my life up he came and cleaned me up I didn't take away the desires in my life he came he took those desires away and this is why that this is where that you and I are able to come to and glory and tribulations in that we're worshiping we're worshiping and worshiping doesn't altogether mean it has has all that everything is always out here but there's a worship to know that in the midst of it I don't know what's taking place I don't know what but I know one thing that God is at work that's it and let me just say this to you that even when things come our way the natural tendency for a Believer is for us to look and say is there something wrong am I somewhere off the path have I wondered and let me just say this as you begin to look in that way and your heart is open for that if there is some place that we're off the way he's faithful to lead us back on the wayen is that right when you ask for a for a piece of bread he don't give you a stone so God doesn't hold from you whatever it is that if you and I need to make restitutions he doesn't keep it from us remember he is the one that desired the relationship and fellowship with you and I the Bible said when we were unlovable yet sinners Christ died for us in this was the love of God manifested to us so this is how we're living based on what he has done for us and in US knowing that tribulation worketh patience it worketh patience yes it and patience this is dealing with endur endurance this is that temper ing it it it just it's a tempering there's things that God knows what you and I are able to handle right now if he terries he knows what we would be able to handle if he terries a month from now a year from now he's he's molding and he's shaping and he's preparing he's working on our life because when this is all said and done the very thing we take with us is our character that that's what goes in the Rapture is is the character notice and patience experience and experience hope and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us so God's love the love of God that is the Holy Spirit the holy spirit is the word of God this is the love of God and that is shed abroad in our hearts God's own life his love this is where you and I that our expectation we're not ashamed that I know and I'm resting in whom I and know in whom I have believed I believe he's able to keep me he's able Jude said to keep me from falling is that right right so this this element here where job himself job has the prophet would describe it like this and you know I've read i' I've pulled out many scriptures here over the over the times we've looked at this portion of it to show you that even where job's thinking in this that throughout he he completely believes that it's God doing it but you see God doesn't bother to step in God's Not you know biting his fingernails and worried about it oh my goodness I got to make sure all this is straightened out God doesn't you know what you know what God what God had confidence in God had confidence in the fellowship that he had with job he knew job that is so good he knew him he knew him before he ever set foot as far as in a physical body upon this earth that is why that God took him where were you before the foundation of the [Music] world this is where God when he begins to speak and deal with this but as as we look at this and seeing these portions in the word job had a grip on God by divine revelation praise to I love that I love how the prophet says that in that way you know it it it brings it down when as we're looking at it because sometimes we uh you know we can look at things as though that everything that we do or say and everything within ourselves that we have to be perfect it's not our Perfection our Perfection is in him and him alone that's what job was standing on the entire time now watch this in re Romans 8 I'm I know these are familiar scriptures but I'm just trying to lay something cuz I'm going somewhere in verse 35 Paul said who shall separate us from the love of Christ now notice Paul could have said what but he didn't he said who who shall tribulation shall distress persecution famine nakedness Pearl or sword as it's written for thy sake we are killed all all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us I want to read this out of the Amplified it's the same meaning it just saves me from posting the meaning yet amid all these things we are more than conquerors and this is what that phrase means gain a surpassing victory through him who loved us what do you mean more than coners a gaining of surpassing Victory a surpassing victory means an exceeding a greater than well what what is it what what can be greater than it's where God's own life is having the right away and prevailing above self it's surpassing this is why that we we to move from Victory unto Victory this is why that the real Victory is the victory over our greatest enemy which is ourself sometimes we when we come into the test or the trial or our perception on something we're looking out here but remember Faith itself is made to be a master of every circumstance it's not so much us trying to control this out here it begins with faith controlling this guy right here Faith down in the engine room that controls and takes control of our thoughts that is so good it takes control because listen when you and I are in control as far as where faith has the rideway then in that situation that's supreme power in control that's Sue it doesn't matter what all that's going on around here you and I have come under the control of the holy spirit this is why Satan's battle over and over is to draw us out into those other realms Paul said for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things to come nor nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord amen so that no matter no Paul said no matter what would come now you know within all of that the Bible tells us of how the seed is swn in four different types of ground remember the seed is the word the word is the same but what is the difference is the ground that it's swn in is that right and that ground we're talking about is what is there that's able to hold to house the word of God true that's that's what it is it's where the word coming to that rightful place and then what the scripture calls it good ground the prophet called that preprepared ground God has he Jehovah Gyra he has provided that ground for himself to come in and for it to Blossom in our lives so when we see this this is where that even this is in one Avenue of our thinking that how that you know um when we're looking at it brother Brandon would take this and in this hour and he would say that how that God was not rebuking job he was only purging him and he said you know a lot of times the trouble of it is we think sometimes God's angry with us but he's only trying to purge us sir now let me just say this to you I want to say this very clearly I think it's a blessing for us to come to a place where we can we will examine and allowing Our Lives to be examined we're living in a time in an age where there's things that I I tell you I I just you just see it where where self-reflection is not really present that's right it's it's just it's always looking and everything else is around and and like I said if we compare ourselves our own life to ladyo and Christianity we can look pretty good but that's not what we're to compare ourselves to we're not even compare ourselves to uh you know the next person we are to compare ourselves with the word of God this is what this is where we're at this is the seriousness of the hour this is what leads us to surpassing victory in our lives yes Lord is that part of it that takes some of the greatest courage is to be able to look face to face in the word and say Lord I'm wrong the word is right and know that there's Grace at that moment given to Our Lives to rise thinking our thinking sometimes and this is why that our thinking sometimes it can affect our yielding it can just cause where our yielding we get down and and we'll just in our thoughts but I believe that's where the spirit of God is is wanting and trying to bring a m through the maturity in our life that it would be reflected in our thoughts in other words we're not going the same Pathways we're not traveling the same Avenues we've always traveled but God is giving us a a Grace and this hour through the washing of Water by the word there's a maturing that's to be going on in our lives this is why the scripture says in 1 Corinthians 13:11 when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put put away childish things let me tell you something if it was not for the grace of God working in our lives let me just say this you and I would remain as children if not if a father doesn't initiate and begin to work on those things for for for young men coming into manhood and even you know a mother working with a young lady if those things are not initiated it things just continue to go and you know we we can't things are not on autopilot right this is why there's got to be an initiation this is why I'm just going to speak maybe this is more like a family part of it but it's very true I find that for even in myself right now there's more time that even as they've gotten older there's even more time more investing right now I'm not saying that begrudgingly I'm just saying that I realized there's more time that's invested right now brother Samuel they're 18 or they're 15 or they're 21 that doesn't mean the hands come off it's a time that's still there to guide us think about God working in our life think about it God has never taken his hands off of our life he's not put his church on autopilot he said I will be there I'll be with you even in you to the end of the age I'll lead and guide you into all things sure the relationship as it changes and God is stepping to bring decisions our way that he won't make for us is that right it begin like when they called Rebecca asked the damsel inquired her mouth just like the the young man who was healed his eyes was healed his parents said ask him he's of age God brings us when the prophet was going to go and go off in the mountains uh because of the complex God didn't tell him you're not doing that God just told him said that's what you want to do okay so that's what you want to do let me just show you this is how it's going to be your wife's going to leave you and this but it's your decision whatever you choose you know what that's showing that's showing a place where the word is bringing us to a place of maturity you say how do I know I'm coming to that place of maturity there's decisions that's put before you and I and that's why Satan battles in the mind because in the mind is where decisions are made amen I thought as a child but see God comes to initiate and comes to bring us up to that we would grow in his grace in in the in the saman church age I think I have that scripture there Brianna H when we look at in the in the saman age where it refers to I think it's Revelations 29 or 19 where God stands there remember in the midst of the seven uh golden candlesticks and he says to this age I Know Thy poverty but thou are rich I know I know I'm aware brother Jerry quoted that quote and I I love that quote so much where it's as as it mentions of where that so much of of the way that it's presented as though that God himself came and saved you and I and then he took then he became disinterested in humanity it's not true God is even now the prophet said even now governing in the affair of men he is both the Creator and sustainer this is why he's walking in the midst of the seven golden Candlestick he is our life Source he is our life he is our all and all and here he is walking in the midst of it and he says I know that's good and the prophet says it like this he says there it is again he's walking up and down in the midst of his church like a father he is looking down upon his family he is the head of his household he is the provider he is the protector yet he looks on at their at their poverty I want you to think of this watch these words oh how the untutored believer stumbles at this how can God bear to to look upon his own in a time of need and not just stop at all not just give in and lavish everything material upon them remember brother Bram says if you do that with your children the end result brother Brown would say the end result is you know when they get married they'll make hell on Earth because they're used to getting their way they've been trained in that way they've been taught that way but you see father hood is where God is a father and there's times to where God is looking at our lives and he doesn't come right down and say uh Richie do this do this don't do this do that but he can look and he knows within your life in my life he knows my weaknesses he knows your weaknesses he knows the areas that we need to be strengthened and you know what he'll do he is there interceding on our behalf the whole time it's not that he's giving in to Lavish us but he wants to see his word come to fruition in our life and the only way that can happen is when we yield and surrender absolutely that's the only way and so as a father he'll pray it's like for myself let me just bring it down the natural there's things that I can see I can see not only when I look at the strengths and I can see strength but when I know the weaknesses and where each of them are at those are the things that we're not setting down to have hammer out those weaknesses those are where I stand as a priest and pray God strengthen Paul in this area Lord Lord help Benjamin in this area Lord Lord work with Zachary Lord give him strength in this area why God knows what you and I have need of and if that is something that would move and where we stand as an Earthly parent how much greater is our Heavenly parent he knows what you and I have need of and yet he doesn't just move right in and just hand it to us right he guides us he brings us to a place of submission Hey listen there's things right now you and I can truly say when we look at it in the word of God and how things that God deals with our life there's ways I'll tell you there's things right now here tonight that I see much differently than what I seen in the past oh yes there's much things even right now of my Approach on some things it's much different than even in my thoughts and other things from the past I don't think I'm the only one but if I am so be it but I I will say it in this way right here it's God working on our lives even when we and I can't allog together see it what if God just set us down and hammered on us on our weaknesses we would you know what that's why Paul said fathers do not make your children angry lest they be discouraged is that right see God knows and this is where where brother BR says here is where you have to believe again in the love and goodness and wisdom of God this is needful I say Lord help us Lord help us Lord Jesus amen I I want to be I want to that's how I want to be I want to trust in that I want to look to him when it comes down with family with the church with all those things looking to him God knows what he's doing he knows what he's doing this is why when Paul would would would speak of of of the ministering spirits that are sent forth to minister to The Heirs of Salvation this is why that as we come together and we gather like this listen friends I believe it's important to get into the message of the hour I I believe I believe you ought to be getting into the message of the hour listening to the tapes listening to the message and and just just you know don't try to figure everything out just just get into it and say Lord just reveal yourself to me Lord I I I want to I want to fall deeper in Love with You Lord getting in I believe in Reading getting into the word of God I believe in praying and not not to where that we become like spiritual monks but to where that it's a relationship we're not robots right are you hearing me well we're not robots within this but this is why that we come together for the live ministering of the word because you know there's one thing with the live ministering of the word is you can't push stop and you can't push pause and you can't push play God's going to roll right down the Avenues that we need strengthen that's where God's going to come and he's going to speak to our lives and our hearts is that right now I believe in being in tune with that that we can be listening to the word I believe that we can receive correction and direction from that but this is why when God sent the ministerial offices in the church the Bible said that he had given in verse 11 some Apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers for what reason the perfecting of the Saints now this Perfection this is not the Perfection that that that comes because of the blood of Jesus Christ this is the Perfection that deals with afterwards the complete Furnishing and making up in our lives right it's God working with us from start to finish amen for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the slight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in waight to deceive but speaking the truth and love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ hallah see God a God that comes through his word it's a promoting of maturity that's but what matters and the effect of that is how that we and whether we will receive it or not that's so good because that word's going to it comes to stir us up that's so good yeah let me just say this right here your character is not molded in here no this is the preaching of the word this is the area where the of the kitchen this is where the food is being served this is the place where the word's coming coming coming forth but the word is there to exort you and I it's there to edify it's there to remind you and I who we are and it's there to point out as the prophet said our shortcomings our weak places and to to bring us in remembrance of this is who you are a son and daughter of God this is why that no matter what situation we we we are so thankful for that Revelation breaking forth that now are we the sons of God but that also holds true when we're offended we're still Sons and Daughters of God when s things happen that don't go our way we're still Sons and Daughters of God we don't want to fall back you want to come back into previous Trails no amen one God Lord help me that there's a maturing in my thinking that that maturing in our thinking does not mean that the thoughts won't cross your path but it's just you being able as a Son of God Discerning those things as they come that it's not going to stay in this ground yeah that's good sir that's what it comes down to it sure does so this is where we want the word we want the word to have preeminence don't we yes we want it to have first place in our lives this is why the prophet when he was said you got to get everything else out and he said in in paragraph 87 of greatest B fought I want you to watch how he says this here he says he says he here he says if it's covered over and you say well these conscience and senses and so forth that don't have anything to do with it brother Bram certainly it does but if you let the word come in and cover it over with conscience then it can't grow it'll be a deformed word so receiving the word in but don't compare the word to your conscience in other words conscience can be previous teaching previous beliefs are you hearing me even the reasonings about things well but it comes down to we want the word to have preeminence and we're not comparing it with our conscience the word is our absolute amen that's where that's where every let all let every other word every other word Every Man's word be alive let God's word be truth we don't want to cover it over so now it becomes that responsibility when we look at it brother B says if we don't if he covers it over he said like that blade of corn it'll grow crooked because something is hindering it and he says you know he goes on in paragraph 89 he says that's what's a matter with a Pentecostal faith today we've let too many things hinder it the faith we've been taught the Holy Spirit that's been living in us we've let too many things looking at somebody else and the devil is always trying to point you to somebody's failure but he tries to keep you away from the real testimony that's genuine there's a lot that could be said and said there Satan is the author of smoking mirrors he's the author of dogging Pony shows he's the author to get our attention off where it needs to be it caus our attention to be put up on like the prophet said somebody else's failures he calls our attention listen Satan doesn't even mind to divert the people's attention to where they elevate a man to oh this got to be this man and oh we got to hear this man why it's still taking the attention off of the real thing and that attention is the real testimony God wants to bring forth in our life God doesn't want us rling around a man he wants us to Rally around the true gift of the Holy Ghost amen that's what God has revealed in this hour oh my aren't you thankful to the Lord this is why the prophet goes on to say in in paragraph 91 of that message I love that message greatest battor fought I love that message it not only deals with that getting down in the soul the conversion but it deals with everyday life it deals with how that we stand victorious in our lives brother BR said it must be accepted in the mind then it's believed with the heart then the word of God becomes a reality then every sense of soul and body is scoured out with the Holy Spirit then your sense of God your conscience of God everything that's Godly flows through you there's not a doubt anywhere there's nothing can rise up and what he's what he's letting us know here where there's nothing that can rise up that once that New Birth has come into your life by the baptism of the Holy Spirit there is nothing that can rise and take that place in our life of authority but you and I you and I have as Paul would speak to us and admonish us to remember that let not sin therefore rign in your mortal body that is so good don't let things dwell kill it bring it in and bring it and try it by the word and it's not according to the word of God you say how do I know it's not according to the word of God just don't try it by the letter try it by the motive and objective that's in your heart that's very good are you hearing me cuz we can have maybe things WR down on the letter but our motive and objective can be wrong is that right now this is let me let me bring let me bring this down here in Romans 8:13 this is where Paul said if ye live after the flesh you shall die but if you through the spirit do mortify the Deeds of the body you shall also live mortify means caused to be put to death now watch the same word is where we read in the beginning of Romans 8:36 the same word mortify for thy sake we are killed all the day long for whose sake his sake for his sake that he might be manifest in our life that the word might be manifest he leads us to a place of full surrender he leads us to that place oh my 1 Peter 3:18 bu for Christ also once suffered for sins the just for the unjust that he might bring us to God being put to death in the flesh but quickened by the spirit how was he put to Death In the Flesh he didn't go to Calvary kicking screaming but he submitted his will to the will of God thank you Father thank you Jesus remember he knew what awaited him that's why that he prayed three times are you hearing me tonight he he entered in to your your suffering my S he entered in to know what it means to obey the word of God listen friends I don't mind telling you I think we can Fellowship on this there's certain things that God has spoke to our heart and he could call us to obey and then there's times in our life when tests and trials and offenses and everything come that's when obedience is a sacrifice that's because it causes us to sacrifice our own will our own thoughts our own feelings sir anybody with me tonight he calls us to do that place so it's being led and this is why that when as we come down here the scripture said for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for we've not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you've received the spirit of adoption that which will produce full sunship whereby we cry Abba Father the spirit itself bearing witness with our spirit that we are the children of God Amen there's a there's a Unity there's nothing that when that when we can stand upon that right there and in that place there's nothing that the word of God could say that there would be a disagreement in the spirit that's within me are you hearing me yes sir because remember the spirit and the word are not two separate things no they are one they are one that's right there might be things that I don't understand there might be things that when my flesh but there's something there that says nevertheless not my will thine will be done is that right there's a strength that prevails within us oh my I'm trying to bring this down here 2 Corinthians 10 10:3 for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds amen that's what that's what we want we want strongholds to be pulled down areas that have been that look even within our lives where the holy spirit will come and deal within our lives that there are things that God comes around and says we need to deal with this strong you know what a stronghold is it's something that's preventing advancement from an army coming to a city and God comes and he deals with strongholds things that have been built up and sometimes we didn't even realize how has this been built up but God comes and as we will submit our life to him it's God who comes and he tears down those strongholds as a matter of fact pulling them down pulling them down that song we just sung there's no wall he won't tear down n none he won't break down coming after me and you know you know all it takes is to say yes Lord to agree with the word of God and when you agree with the word of God the word of God comes down we accept it we believe it and then the word itself will go and it will take care of that stronghold it has within it power yeah Power damous power like they break down those beaver dams out west when they want to clog up the water from traveling in certain places and those those rangers know hey water's not traveling like it should be let's go Upstream they don't look at what they see here let's go upstream and let's see what's hindering the flow of water you've got to go back to whatever is hindering it and the Holy Spirit knows exactly where to go in our lives to any anything that's hindering the flow of the Holy Spirit as a Believer and I'm glad that God has some Dynamite he knows how to strategically place and position in our lives and I want to say Lord put it there put it here put it there wherever Lord you see I don't want I don't want anything left of it I want it gone Lord I want it gone amen you know sometimes when they're putting that Dynamite they got to drill a little bit and then they'll put it there in the hole then they got to drill over here a little bit put in the hole you know what they're getting it in the places so that the thing the area is moved God knows just how to position in our lives sometimes he'll take a series of services and [Music] he'll then he'll send in then he'll send in another brother then he'll send in another one you know God loves to surprise us yes God God you know God isn't intimidated by our Humanity our Humanity can still be there and God you know what he just goes right he goes right beyond that what are you what are you saying by that I'm saying God will bring in other Ministries it's a different looking Veil but it's the same God and God's working in the same way in our lives and you know what it does and here we sometimes you know we we might be a little bit more open or a little bit more loose and God's just and he's putting them sticks of dynamite and all of it is his working that's what I love about about it I love him for that don't you oh I just those little things like that just to me it's a great big thing it just makes me love him makes me love him so much more casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought now I want you to notice this let me just close on this casting down imaginations right and every High thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of God nothing nothing is to be raised above the word nothing and bring every captivity bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ and having in a Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled now I want you to watch this how brother Bram places this here in the message inspiration I'm I'm closing in the message inspiration brother Bram says it like this because I want you to think casting down reasonings brother BR says each one of you had experiences where you would think and somebody will say it can't happen it won't be but something right down in your soul that tells you it's going to be yes sir it don't make any difference what anybody else says or how unreasonable it seems to be you seem to know that it's going to be that way it's because your soul has testified and reasonings has been cast down as the Bible said they should be casting down reasonings you see the power of agreeing with the word of God so be it Lord and receiving the word of God and not trying to compare it to anything else but receive the word of God the word of God it will displace and cast out reasonings watch this an uncertain sound I'll give you a couple examples here in a minute watch this again brother Ram says All Of You' had this at times when you would think I don't know whether it could happen or not and all at once something just tells you it's going to happen regardless of what anybody else says you know it's going to happen he said we've all had them experiences that's now watch this watch very carefully that's when your heart's thinking see there's a difference when your heart's thinking and then we're using this to think with is that right notice he says that's when your heart's thinking as a man thinketh in his heart see he said the Mind reasons but the heart don't reason it just believes amen that's when the heart is thinking that's what God comes by his word the ministering of his word is to bring his word in our life and it'll change our thoughts I I think we can all Fellowship on this there's times we've set right here I won't just say times but I can't tell you how many times sitting right here and the Holy Spirit has come and it's been a discernment of my thoughts and with the discernment of my thoughts there's been a change that you just you realize man this is speaking directly to me I'm not talking about you I'm talking about me right now when I've sat right here and said this is speaking directly to me and you know what I needed that I I wasn't catching it maybe in a certain way and God will come right down and you realize hey this is exactly where I am this is exactly what I've needed and what happens as soon as you receive it and submit to it it's a casting down of reasonings yes it so the casting down of reasoning isn't like our mental exercise it's receiving the word of God it's presenting ourselves in a place to where the word of God can drop into our hearts remember brother Bram said job had a way of being able to get himself out of the way and inspiration to come you know the little shinomi woman brother BR uses this example where when she got after her little son had passed and had that heat stroke but when she got there before the prophet and here when they asked how is it with you and your house she said all is well right there reasonings was cast down imaginations was cast down right she didn't know how everything was going to happen she didn't know everything that was going to take place but right there she had an assurance this is the word of the Lord for me Glory right and right there she cast down reasonings when Bud brother Brown remember the vision brother Brown had of the Caribou than the vision brother Bram had about killing that Silver Tip Grizzly remember that yeah and here but I like how brother Bram tells it in wisdom versus faith when God gave him that vision of what was going to take place on that hunting trip and see God had it in such a way bud being a guide in that part of the country he told brother brandham brother Bram I ain't never seen Grizzlies here I Ain never seen them here you say you know if you listen if we're not careful you get to look at things and you're thinking well what does that testimony have to do with my life there's a lot of things that you might not see in your life but God sees in your life God knows what he's placed in your life life he knows the vision of your life and of my life come on now what good could come out of this what good could come out of their life God knows what he's placed in your life Hallelujah and here bud said brother Bram is talking about it how Bud said and he looked over what brother Brown was going to shoot him with that right there was troubling too yeah yeah that gun yeah that gun wasn't fitting that caliber was not fitting to shoot a Grizzly with right all right it'd be like trying to shoot it'd be the equivalency almost of trying to shoot a deer with a pellet gun I'm not you know I I don't have the exact caliber but Bud was a bud being a guide back there professional he's looking at everything and that's the gun that's what it is and then and then Bud told him continue to say never seen one out here brother Bram even throughout brother Bram are are you sure that are are you sure about with this and brother Ram said Bud you're not doubting are you you're not doubting are you but no brother BR I you know I I love that I love those stories in there and he's looking over there and but said no no no I'm not he said butd he said I kind of believe you are he said but he he told me he said he was going to come down like this and and he says this is the way he says and I'd get him right there between the eyes and he would fall right here and he said and butd just kept on going and brother BR says it like this he said what was taking place he said God had revealed it I believed it and he said when that has happened you cast down all reasonings and all circumstances that's why it's so important for a vision of the word that's why it's important friends that's why the word of God when it's coming it brings Clarity in our walk with God it brings Clarity of a vision that's before us yes sir and then brother bram's there aiming he's waiting on brother Bram to shoot it finally when brother brandham when he shoots it where he saw the vision tell him to shoot it and you know the bear brother Bud said I didn't know it was going to end up in my lap but you see God had already spoken and I wanted to say this to you we seen through the life of the Prophet what God is bringing you and I to oh yes oh yes you know it's one thing God could have just told us but God also showed us I'm not lifting up brother brandom you understand that what I'm trying to tell you is and and I where I stand the same quality of the holy spirit that was within him is the same one in you and me and what it produced there it's producing in our lives to where to be able to stand there where there doesn't seem to be anything but to stand there and say God's word is true that when tests and trials like we job as we just wrap that up in that point where job stands there and job is standing we're privileged let me say this to you we are privileged to stand in a place where you and I look at it right now to have an understanding that when test or trials comes it's not God that's doing it he's permitting it to mold us to shape us to temper us to make us see whether or not we're really tied to this earth and you know what sometimes there's things that maybe God it can show up a little bit in our lives and we realize Lord I want to be tied tighter to you I want to be tied tighter to you than anything of this world see we we don't we don't ever want to get to a place where we're too big and say well I'm I'm I'm not I'm not tied down with the Earth but there's always more of a loosening Lord I I want to be tied more I I want Lord not that the thoughts won't come through but I want to mature I want my life I want to just continue to mature and where our thoughts and that maturity that you know God is with us God is in control I don't know what's taking place I don't know all that's I don't know all that's going on but I know that God is in control I know God is in control and you know what I know that I'm a part of this Rapture and this Rapture is a part of me I may not know all the inet between here and there but I know one thing he has given his word and his word is sufficient to see me through and if we'll take in that word just just taking in that word oh God I want to just be an absorbant to that word I want to pass my thoughts I want to pass all of my life through that word Lord that where we stand within it there's a maturing in in our thinking when we're not we're not entertaining some things as we used to entertain it before I believe the grace of God comes to give us victory in every area of our life I tell you we're friends we're a privileged people but the Privileges we don't want to let the moment pass Us by either Lord I want to I just want to I want to draw from you Lord I want my want I want to grow I want to continue to grow I want to continue to mature I want everything all that he asked

of thing Lord sometimes Lord we can get so tense and I think about that Lord of just even in our thinking sometimes Lord with other things that take place around us and Lord It's always it's where the enemy Lord wants to come and try to Lord hinder the yielding in our lives to you true Lord help us Lord to yield more to you Lord I think of how the prophet when you spoke to him and said you must be
