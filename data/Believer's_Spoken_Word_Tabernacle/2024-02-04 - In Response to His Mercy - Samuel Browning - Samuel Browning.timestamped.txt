[37:01] amen and he gives us strength to push
[37:03] through all of that amen so so good to
[37:06] be in the house of the Lord and we just
[37:09] want to look into the word for what the

[40:11] the grace Lord that we might be able to
[40:13] see what the father is doing and do
[40:15] likewise Lord we love you and we thank
[40:18] you Father for your mercy once again
[40:20] this morning we just pray Lord may you
[40:22] come and open the word to our hearts
[40:24] Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[40:29] I'd like to begin in Acts chapter 9 and
[40:31] uh verse
[40:33] three and this is the account of Saul
[40:37] when he is preparing to go and arrest
[40:39] more of the
[40:41] Believers and as he journeyed he came
[40:44] near Damascus and suddenly there shined
[40:46] round about him a light from heaven and
[40:49] he fell to the Earth and heard a voice
[40:51] saying unto him Saul Saul why
[40:55] persecutest thou me and he said who art
[40:59] thou Lord and the Lord said I am Jesus
[41:04] whom thou persecutest it is hard for
[41:07] thee to kick against the Pricks now if
[41:10] you'll notice when he's asked he's seen
[41:13] this same Pillar of Fire that Moses saw
[41:17] and he's asked who are you Lord because
[41:19] every time when he would appear God
[41:21] would make known his name or that of a
[41:24] Redemptive name and so asked him who are
[41:27] you so now the same Lord Jesus who
[41:30] walked in the Corporal body which is God
[41:33] came now has descended back down and
[41:36] tabernacled in his body of Believers and
[41:39] Paul was the one who was persecuting the
[41:43] work of God but to think just in a
[41:46] moment's notice just in a moment in the
[41:49] presence of God everything
[41:51] changes who art thou Lord and the Lord
[41:54] said I am Jesus whom thou persecutest it
[41:58] is hard for thee to kick against the
[42:00] Pricks and he trembling and astonished
[42:03] said Lord What wilt thou have me to do
[42:09] and the Lord said unto him arise and go
[42:12] into the City and it shall be told thee
[42:15] what thou must do but the Lord now let's
[42:18] go to verse 15 and here is the Lord
[42:21] speaking to ananas you can find you know
[42:23] in the scripture if your Bible reader
[42:25] ananas was a little worried about even
[42:27] though when the Lord spoke to him and
[42:28] told him what to do he's a little
[42:30] worried Lord you know about this guy
[42:33] this guy I mean I if I go and approach
[42:36] him he's already been hailing people
[42:38] away and they've been killing people for
[42:41] this but notice how the Lord just
[42:43] Comforts ananas the Lord said unto him
[42:46] go thy way for he speaking of Paul is a
[42:49] chosen vessel unto me to Bear my name
[42:53] before the Gentiles and kings and the
[42:56] children of Israel for I will show him
[42:59] how great things he must suffer for my
[43:01] name's sake and ananas went his way and
[43:05] entered into the house and putting his
[43:06] hands on him said brother Saul I like
[43:10] that don't
[43:11] you brother Saul the Lord even Jesus
[43:15] that appeared unto thee in the way as
[43:18] thou camest hath sent me that thou
[43:21] mightest receive thy sight and be filled
[43:24] with the Holy Ghost
[43:26] and immediately there fell from his eyes
[43:29] as it had been scales and he received
[43:32] sight forwith and arose and was baptized
[43:36] amen may God bless you bless the reading
[43:38] of the word as you're being
[43:39] seated I'd like to read a quote to you
[43:42] from the message of the
[43:44] hour brother REM says God is
[43:48] just he will not send judgment before he
[43:52] offers mercy and anybody's a Bible
[43:55] reader you you know that that before God
[43:57] will send judgment such as what the
[43:59] Judgment that was impending in the days
[44:01] of Noah God first sent his mercy and God
[44:06] Not only would reveal this Mercy his way
[44:09] his plan his approach to Noah Noah would
[44:12] act upon that Noah would preach for 120
[44:15] years it was God's mercy that was
[44:17] ringing out to that generation and yet
[44:20] only eight were saved out of that whole
[44:22] generation but Noah preached as though
[44:26] that everybody could be saved you see
[44:30] I'm thankful that God puts it in our
[44:32] hearts to have the confidence that what
[44:34] God did for me what God has done for you
[44:38] it's a reality that you know that God it
[44:40] is a paradox of how that God has
[44:42] overrode our first nature and been able
[44:46] to turn things around to a
[44:47] submissiveness to him and so our
[44:49] confidence is not in our ability to
[44:52] speak the word our confidence is not in
[44:54] our ability to debate the word word but
[44:56] our confidence is The God Who lives
[44:59] inside our heart and for what he's done
[45:01] for me what he's done in you that then
[45:04] becomes the experience or the witness
[45:07] from which we speak from and anything
[45:09] less than that it it won't get the job
[45:11] done it must be God himself and so we
[45:15] find that every time before judgment
[45:17] there is Mercy that is given even when
[45:20] Moses went down with a message the
[45:22] message itself was a message of Mercy is
[45:25] that right even when God himself steps
[45:28] down in and puts upon a body of Flesh
[45:31] and it comes before Abraham's tent door
[45:33] it's a message of Mercy but yet when lot
[45:37] himself remember what actually happens
[45:40] is there comes a judgment upon Sodom so
[45:44] every time when we find that and yet you
[45:46] know there was Mercy that was given
[45:48] there but uh we think about the mercy of
[45:50] God and so every time that when God
[45:53] would send his Mercy we certainly want
[45:56] to receive God's mercy I want to receive
[45:59] all the mercy that God has for me when
[46:02] we look at this here let me finish this
[46:04] quote and brother BR says and mercy is
[46:07] foretold and how it will come and but
[46:10] the people usually is so all mixed up
[46:13] and in their minds and so many different
[46:15] man-made schemes till they don't
[46:18] recognize it and that's the way it
[46:20] always happens remember the Pharisees
[46:22] when they stood there religious men of
[46:24] that day knew the scripture very well
[46:26] they knew the writings of the prophets
[46:28] they knew the law but when the Lord
[46:30] Jesus God's mercy made manifest before
[46:33] them which had been prophesied all the
[46:36] way through the scriptures and had
[46:38] already been declared but yet when God's
[46:40] mercy was being projected to them they
[46:43] rejected it and they themselves turned
[46:45] around and called it be Elba they had
[46:48] there was so many other schemes and so
[46:50] many other ways that they had figured
[46:52] out and it didn't come according to how
[46:54] that they had it figured out so they
[46:56] didn't receive it even though they could
[46:59] not deny that this word it was it was
[47:02] God that was with this man they couldn't
[47:05] deny it Nicodemus let the cat out of the
[47:07] bag Nicodemus said we know that thou art
[47:10] a teacher come from God so they knew it
[47:14] but you know it was something about it
[47:16] they were not able or did not have the
[47:18] ability to actually be able to submit
[47:21] their hearts and lives to the mercy of
[47:24] God that was being made manifest I I
[47:26] don't know about you but I want my heart
[47:28] to be in that place Lord let my heart be
[47:31] tenderized Let It Be softened you know
[47:33] even with the promise that God sends to
[47:35] you and I when the mercy of God is
[47:38] moving in this generation moving in
[47:40] every and each time that it's coming
[47:43] forth you realize it's the spirit of God
[47:45] that goes forth that begins to call the
[47:47] elect begins to break down and begins to
[47:50] move upon Hearts to bring you and I into
[47:54] that place of condition to be able to
[47:57] receive the mercy of God so it's it's
[47:59] not you or I it's not him that willth
[48:01] not him that runneth but it's God that
[48:04] showeth mercy so when we look at this
[48:07] and considering the mercy of God I I
[48:09] want to speak here just a few moments on
[48:12] the thought of in in in that of in
[48:15] response to his Mercy in response to his
[48:20] Mercy now let me read I just referred to
[48:22] this scripture but let me read out of
[48:24] Romans 9 Paul would be the one that
[48:26] would be the writer here he would know
[48:28] this by Revelation and experience what
[48:31] shall we say then is there
[48:33] unrighteousness with God God forbid for
[48:36] he saith to Moses I will have mercy on
[48:40] whom I will have mercy and I will have
[48:43] compassion on whom I will have
[48:45] compassion so then it is not of him that
[48:48] willth nor of him that runneth but of
[48:51] God that showeth mercy so the display of
[48:56] mercy of God's mercy rests solely on God
[49:00] himself it's God showing his mercy so
[49:04] how does God show Mercy how does God
[49:06] show compassion by showing his Mercy
[49:10] well what's his Mercy his Mercy is
[49:13] himself his Mercy is making known the
[49:17] word that he has promised in that
[49:19] generation and making it alive and
[49:22] making it real that is God showing Mercy
[49:26] then what would it be for those who
[49:28] actually are captured and receive that
[49:31] Mercy then they are recipients of the
[49:35] mercy that God has shown now let's see
[49:38] this in the scripture verse 17 for the
[49:41] scripture said unto Pharaoh even for
[49:44] this same purpose have I raised thee up
[49:46] that I might show my power in thee and
[49:49] that my name might be declared
[49:51] throughout all the Earth therefore hath
[49:55] he Mercy on whom he will have mercy and
[49:58] whom he will he hardeneth now think
[50:02] about this thou wil say then why then
[50:04] why does he yet find fault for who hath
[50:07] resisted his will nay but oh man who art
[50:11] thou that repliest against God shall the
[50:14] thing form say to him that formed it why
[50:17] hast Thou made me thus now think about
[50:21] it here here is God displaying his Mercy
[50:25] when God hardened Pharaoh's heart it
[50:27] wasn't that God came down in an
[50:29] obstinate way an arrogant way no
[50:32] remember showing Mercy is the displaying
[50:35] of his promise He makes himself known
[50:39] that he is the god of his word that he
[50:41] is still the I am and it's incredible
[50:44] thing how that when God will make
[50:46] himself known by his promise there will
[50:48] be some that will actually become
[50:51] hardened at the manifestation and then
[50:53] there are others who actually become
[50:56] tenderized and actually receive the
[50:59] mercy of God so you say what is it that
[51:01] makes the determining Factor well it's
[51:03] the choice whether to receive it or to
[51:06] reject it I thank God for his Mercy
[51:09] don't you I thank God for his Mercy
[51:11] because it isn't that God was just
[51:13] coming right at at Pharaoh remember the
[51:16] same promise that was made manifest to
[51:18] Pharaoh was manifest to the children of
[51:20] Israel but there was something different
[51:23] on the inside that was able to be
[51:26] captured by and be moved by the mercy of
[51:29] God in that moment now watch verse 21
[51:32] hath not the Potter power over the clay
[51:35] of the same lump to make one vessel unto
[51:37] honor and another unto dishonor what if
[51:41] God willing to show his wrath and to
[51:43] make his power known endured with much
[51:46] long suffering the vessels of Wrath
[51:49] fitted to destruction and that he might
[51:51] make known The Riches of his glory on
[51:54] the vessels of Mercy Mercy which he had
[51:57] a four prepared unto Glory so now all
[52:02] mankind is out of the same lump of clay
[52:05] our our flesh is no different than
[52:07] anybody else's flesh as a matter of fact
[52:09] the even the elements that make our
[52:11] flesh up it's no different than pig skin
[52:13] cow skin cow hide and on and on it's out
[52:15] of the same elements of this Earth but
[52:18] there must be something that is
[52:20] different that that would resolve within
[52:23] a life that would absolutely separate a
[52:26] life from being a vessel Of Dishonor to
[52:28] a vessel of Honor now I don't mind
[52:30] telling you in times past Paul said we
[52:33] lived as vessels of Dishonor we were
[52:36] moved about by The Prince and power of
[52:38] the air we were carried here and there
[52:40] what was it we were actually in our life
[52:43] bearing false witness of the truth that
[52:46] was actually in us but when the light
[52:48] comes across our pathway what does it do
[52:51] it breaks the LIE of the first birth it
[52:54] breaks the delusion and the lie and it
[52:56] allows then the truth to come into
[52:58] expression that we in ourselves might be
[53:02] bear witness of the truth that was
[53:04] always in us but now the mercy of God
[53:07] has been displayed to Quicken that life
[53:10] and here we are vessels of
[53:14] Mercy now a vessel you know you have
[53:16] vessels utensils instruments in your
[53:19] house you have vessels that you place
[53:21] things in you you use them they are
[53:23] meant for for a certain purpose pots and
[53:26] so forth and things and that's the same
[53:29] thing it is within our life we we are
[53:31] intended to be as vessels of God's mercy
[53:34] so when someone can look at your life
[53:37] look at my life it ought to be such like
[53:39] a billboard that this is God's mercy in
[53:42] this hour on display if there's anything
[53:45] of a greater witness that we can give
[53:48] you listen I I I believe that we we
[53:50] should give ourselves to the word I
[53:52] believe we ought to take the word in but
[53:53] let me tell you what's more powerful ful
[53:55] then you know in a whole list of quotes
[53:57] you know in a whole list of scriptures
[53:59] is having the life of God on the inside
[54:01] of you and being able to live an
[54:04] overcoming life again and again and
[54:06] again because somebody on the workplace
[54:08] or in your family may never ever ask you
[54:10] for a scripture they may never ask you
[54:13] for anything but they will see your life
[54:16] on display and see God's mercy and then
[54:20] because of that then you yourself are
[54:22] like ananas you are a vessel of Mercy
[54:26] going and displaying God's mercy to
[54:29] another vessel that that vessel itself
[54:32] might be captured by the same life
[54:34] that's inside of
[54:36] you in response to God's mercy now
[54:40] notice Mercy itself I I love this the
[54:42] very word itself of Mercy Mercy means
[54:45] the kindness or the Good Will towards
[54:48] the miserable and The Afflicted how many
[54:51] are witnesses of that I like this next
[54:54] part joined with a desire to help them
[54:59] God's mercy was projected and he shows
[55:02] his Mercy to The Afflicted to the
[55:05] destitute to the downcast and he joins
[55:09] himself in order to help us now how does
[55:13] God join himself to you and I well God
[55:16] joins himself first of all by uniting
[55:19] himself with his word and manifesting it
[55:23] and God will take that word and speak it
[55:26] through chosen vessels he'll move it
[55:29] down and then the word that we hear that
[55:31] Mercy being shown it will spark
[55:34] something inside of our life and then it
[55:37] becomes the mercy of God joining with
[55:40] our lives to help us live an overcoming
[55:43] life aren't you glad for that no wonder
[55:47] Paul could write in 2 Corinthians 47
[55:49] knowing his own Humanity we have this
[55:52] treasure this Mercy in Earth and vessels
[55:56] that the Excellency of the power may be
[55:59] of God and not of us now I want you to
[56:03] think about this in this in this manner
[56:06] I'm going to just take a little journey
[56:07] here this morning uh I've really just
[56:10] been pouring through the book of Acts
[56:11] and how the Lord's been taking me in
[56:12] that direction but I want to just pour
[56:14] it in this way and I want you to keep
[56:16] that word response in your mind and in
[56:19] your heart in response to his Mercy oh I
[56:22] pray to God that we would have a resp
[56:24] responds continually to the mercy of God
[56:27] Lord help us to be sensitive help us to
[56:30] have a heart that's ready to respond I I
[56:32] don't want to be weighed down with the
[56:34] cares of this life everybody knows
[56:36] that's a battle is that right you know
[56:37] it's a battle in your mind there's
[56:39] things that'll try to take your mind
[56:41] right here in service there's things
[56:42] that'll try to weigh you down things can
[56:44] get on your mind but this is where to
[56:46] say Lord I Need Your Grace and I need
[56:48] your help Lord help me not to miss what
[56:51] it is that you want to say to me amen
[56:54] now notice this in Acts 1 and verse 2
[56:57] until the day now here's after the
[57:00] resurrection of the Lord Jesus until the
[57:02] day in which he was taken up after that
[57:05] he through the Holy Ghost had given
[57:07] Commandments unto the apostles which he
[57:08] had chosen to whom also he showed
[57:12] himself alive after his Passion by many
[57:16] infallible proofs being seen of them 40
[57:19] days and speaking of the things
[57:21] pertaining to the kingdom of God now
[57:23] think about it the deciples remember
[57:25] they were walking around they were
[57:26] bewildered they could not figure out
[57:28] what had taken place we thought he
[57:30] should have been a redeemer well he was
[57:32] but it wasn't it didn't happen according
[57:35] to how they thought it should happen but
[57:37] you know one thing I love about this is
[57:39] that although there can be for the elect
[57:41] of God some part that seemingly could go
[57:44] over our head God in his grace when it's
[57:47] time for that word to be made known to
[57:49] you and I he'll come right back around
[57:51] and take a hold of our life and begin to
[57:54] reveal himself self that he indeed is
[57:56] the promis keeping God that's what he
[57:59] did to him on the road to emus now think
[58:01] about it the next promise that there to
[58:03] receive the whole coming of the Redeemer
[58:05] why did he come well he come to redeem
[58:07] us that's true but remember Redemption
[58:10] was through the shedding of the blood to
[58:12] pay the price settle the sin debt but
[58:15] then that that life that was in that
[58:17] blood cell God's own life Zoe could then
[58:19] be released back upon the worshipper to
[58:23] where it could actually bring for for
[58:25] the new birth because before this coming
[58:27] of the Holy Ghost there's no New Birth
[58:30] there's no Born Again experience that
[58:33] can only come by the Holy Spirit himself
[58:36] giving birth to his seed or quickening
[58:39] that life on the inside now think about
[58:42] it here is the Lord here is the Lord
[58:44] Jesus here is God in fulfillment of his
[58:46] word the next Junction is that where
[58:49] they themselves would go and wait for
[58:51] Joel 2:28 the promise of the father the
[58:55] Holy Spirit to be poured out but in
[58:57] order to get to that place he being a
[58:59] faithful father to his children would
[59:02] gather them around and begin to point
[59:04] them to the promise and let them know
[59:07] that what God has said is true now this
[59:10] is the promise for your life and that's
[59:13] the coming of the Holy Ghost In other
[59:15] words God doesn't leave anything to
[59:17] guesswork in our life if we're the one
[59:20] listen to me now if we're the ones
[59:22] that's guessing then that's where we
[59:23] need to say Lord get me out of this
[59:25] guessing pattern and Lord help me to get
[59:27] tuned into to you help me not to be
[59:30] listening to so many other voices and
[59:32] help me to get dialed into the voice of
[59:34] almighty God because God prepares us for
[59:37] every Junction for each moment and this
[59:40] is why we need the leadership of the
[59:42] spirit of God that's why the Rapture
[59:44] itself is not going to be a Quantum Leap
[59:47] but the Rapture will be step in the life
[59:50] of a Believer where God has been working
[59:52] in a life day by day and we are making
[59:55] steps in him his word is moving in our
[59:58] lives and it will be another step in the
[1:00:01] life of a Believer so God just doesn't
[1:00:03] do Quantum leaps it's every step and all
[1:00:06] words are fulfilled in that order now
[1:00:09] notice think about this I want you to
[1:00:12] think you think God didn't want to come
[1:00:14] in and fill them right then sure he did
[1:00:16] but he's the only way that's going to
[1:00:17] happen is it must be according to the
[1:00:19] word and their faith must be established
[1:00:22] on the word you see if you're if you can
[1:00:25] get to a place to where your faith is
[1:00:27] established on the word to know that God
[1:00:29] gave the word and sent the promise for
[1:00:31] you there's not enough devils in hell
[1:00:33] can stand between you and that promise
[1:00:35] there's a hunger in your heart for a
[1:00:37] veil to be broken there's a veil sure as
[1:00:39] the world to be broken and the spirit of
[1:00:42] God will bring us into that place now
[1:00:44] watch this verse four and being
[1:00:47] assembled with them together commanded
[1:00:49] them that they should not depart from
[1:00:51] Jerusalem but wait for the promise of
[1:00:54] the father which saith he ye have heard
[1:00:56] of me for John truly baptized with water
[1:01:00] but you shall be baptized with the Holy
[1:01:03] Ghost not many days hence so notice he's
[1:01:06] he's admonishing them as his children
[1:01:09] that wait upon the promise don't don't
[1:01:11] go out don't do anything until you have
[1:01:14] the Assurance of the promise and this is
[1:01:18] what he says a few verses on down in
[1:01:20] verse eight but you shall receive power
[1:01:23] after that the Holy Ghost is come upon
[1:01:25] you and you shall be Witnesses unto me
[1:01:29] in Jerusalem Judea Samaria and to the
[1:01:31] uttermost parts of the earth now I want
[1:01:33] you to watch here I read part of this to
[1:01:35] you last week out of the message what
[1:01:37] house will you build me and brother Bram
[1:01:39] says not only our message should be the
[1:01:42] flame of the hour it should be the flame
[1:01:46] in our hearts it's got to be in our
[1:01:50] hearts or we can't rightly present it to
[1:01:54] the people people the spirit has to pack
[1:01:57] the message itself so it it won't do any
[1:02:00] good if it's just up here it won't do
[1:02:02] any good if it's just on a bookshelf it
[1:02:05] won't do any good if it's just on your
[1:02:06] tablet or on your phone it's got to be
[1:02:08] down inside of our heart and that is a
[1:02:12] sovereign work between you and God alone
[1:02:16] but let me just say this to you God will
[1:02:18] deal with your heart like he dealt with
[1:02:20] them on Luke 24 and God will try to move
[1:02:23] you and I around to point us to the
[1:02:26] promise that's for us now what matters
[1:02:28] is whether or not we will take it
[1:02:30] seriously and give ourselves to it we
[1:02:33] want to have the right response to God's
[1:02:35] mercy because we're never promised
[1:02:38] multiple
[1:02:40] opportunities is that right we're not
[1:02:41] promised that we're only promised one
[1:02:44] opportunity as a matter of fact in the
[1:02:45] message marriage of the Lamb brother
[1:02:47] Bram talks in the end of that message
[1:02:49] and he speaks of how just the previous
[1:02:51] nights before that he'd come out of a
[1:02:53] meeting and here it was was he said I no
[1:02:55] sooner got out of the door in 15 minutes
[1:02:57] he said here's this car accident and he
[1:02:59] said with this car accident here was a
[1:03:01] mother that was laying there taking her
[1:03:04] last breath and he said her daughter was
[1:03:07] standing right beside her and the mother
[1:03:09] spoke to her daughter and said daughter
[1:03:12] we did wrong tonight we did not respond
[1:03:16] to the call of the Holy Spirit she said
[1:03:19] brother brother bam that was her last
[1:03:21] words I tell you we do not know what the
[1:03:25] next moment holds that that's not to
[1:03:27] bring fear but it's to understand this
[1:03:29] life is not about this life this life is
[1:03:33] a moment of preparation getting you
[1:03:36] ready for the next life you have to have
[1:03:39] an assurance right now that you're ready
[1:03:41] to go amen and if you don't then there's
[1:03:44] a time right here this morning would be
[1:03:46] a time and a place to settle
[1:03:49] it so when we look at this and we we
[1:03:52] talk about as brother Bram is bring BR
[1:03:54] in this in and what house will you build
[1:03:55] me remember as we've been looking at
[1:03:58] this with the Queen of Sheba and how the
[1:04:00] brother says that when Israel saw that
[1:04:02] gift manifested they rallied around that
[1:04:04] gift now when you think of the word
[1:04:06] rally don't think of it like a pep rally
[1:04:09] because a pep rally can be people
[1:04:11] catching one another's spirit and
[1:04:12] they're all just kind of worked up into
[1:04:14] an emotion that's not what a rally is
[1:04:17] brother Bam's telling us what this rally
[1:04:19] is he said if we will rally around the
[1:04:21] gift of the Holy Ghost in This last days
[1:04:24] it'll set such a love of God in your
[1:04:27] heart and for the heart of others he
[1:04:29] said you won't be critical and tearing
[1:04:30] one another down you will actually be be
[1:04:33] joined together in a real Divine love so
[1:04:35] let me tell you how we rally we do not
[1:04:38] Rally by getting around the message the
[1:04:40] message the message we rally in the
[1:04:42] right way by having the message inside
[1:04:45] of us by receiving the gift of the Holy
[1:04:48] Ghost in our life y that's how we really
[1:04:51] rally around this word
[1:04:55] amen now look at this in the message
[1:04:58] desperation brother BR says the token
[1:05:01] now he's just preached that morning the
[1:05:03] token message he says the token Jesus
[1:05:07] Christ the holy spirit is among us we
[1:05:11] should reverence that we can't humble
[1:05:16] ourselves
[1:05:18] enough and watch what he says taking off
[1:05:21] our shoes getting on your knees wouldn't
[1:05:25] expel it it wouldn't satisfy it wouldn't
[1:05:29] suffice it so anything as far as we can
[1:05:33] we could get down upon our knees we
[1:05:36] could take off our shoes like Moses did
[1:05:39] but that won't suffice it you see not
[1:05:42] only will it not suffice God but that
[1:05:45] suffice won't reain and reach back into
[1:05:47] your heart in a settl either the only
[1:05:50] way that it can actually be in the
[1:05:53] correct way is is that our heart must
[1:05:56] come into a place of surrender and ever
[1:05:59] remain
[1:06:00] there notice but a life that brings
[1:06:03] forth the fruit of the spirit now he
[1:06:05] says now what is the fruit of the spirit
[1:06:07] love joy peace referring to gal
[1:06:09] Galatians 5 now watch remember this
[1:06:11] morning watch this progression
[1:06:13] preparation he sent the messenger with a
[1:06:17] message the next thing he done after he
[1:06:20] sent the messenger with the message he
[1:06:23] sent the pillar of Fire for a
[1:06:24] Vindication next thing after that was a
[1:06:28] consolation you knew that it was right
[1:06:32] you was at peace we have peace with God
[1:06:35] through our Lord Jesus Christ so he
[1:06:37] sends the messenger with a message
[1:06:41] that's what he did down in Egypt right
[1:06:42] this is God works God's patterns don't
[1:06:45] change he sent a messenger with the
[1:06:48] message then he accompanies that
[1:06:51] vindicating that that message is not
[1:06:54] that man's
[1:06:55] ideas that this is my thoughts this is
[1:07:01] my word is that right so the pillar of
[1:07:04] Fire coming to vindicate the message it
[1:07:07] raises it to an absolute why because
[1:07:10] it's God's thoughts this is why
[1:07:13] sometimes where people struggle and well
[1:07:14] I'm claiming the Bible as my absolute
[1:07:16] you cannot just claim the Bible as your
[1:07:19] absolute and deny God revealing his word
[1:07:22] in this hour because listen you and I
[1:07:25] for Generations men walked according to
[1:07:28] their own thoughts about God's word but
[1:07:31] God in this hour has raised his word and
[1:07:35] he has displayed his thoughts concerning
[1:07:39] his word I'll tell you what that does
[1:07:41] that brings Liberty and deliverance to
[1:07:44] the children of God it gives you a place
[1:07:46] that you can reach out of and say that's
[1:07:48] a certain place that I can get to and
[1:07:51] stand on aren't you glad oh I more to be
[1:07:54] said on that but anyhow notice how that
[1:07:57] the message accompanied with a pillar of
[1:07:59] fire and then the next thing that
[1:08:01] follows that was to take the lamb slay
[1:08:05] it and apply the blood and eat that
[1:08:09] lamb in order to be at peace so what
[1:08:13] they had accepted was the messenger's
[1:08:16] message that had been confirmed by the
[1:08:18] pillar of fire and now they had a
[1:08:20] confirmation in their heart they were at
[1:08:22] peace right
[1:08:24] I tell you there's nothing greater than
[1:08:26] the Peace of almighty God is that right
[1:08:28] it's a peace that passes all
[1:08:31] understanding amen now watch this in
[1:08:34] Acts chapter 2 let's talk about this
[1:08:36] flame a little bit when the day of
[1:08:38] Pentecost was fully come they were all
[1:08:41] with one Accord in one place and
[1:08:43] suddenly there came a sound from Heaven
[1:08:46] as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it
[1:08:48] filled all the house where they were
[1:08:49] sitting and there appeared unto them
[1:08:52] clothing tongues like as a fire and it
[1:08:55] sat upon each of them same Pillar of
[1:08:58] Fire and they were all filled with the
[1:09:02] Holy Ghost and began to speak with other
[1:09:05] tongues as the spirit gave them
[1:09:07] utterance so who is the spirit of God
[1:09:10] falling upon who is it falling and
[1:09:12] filling it is filling Sons and Daughters
[1:09:16] of God vessels that have been for
[1:09:20] prepared to receive God's mercy amen
[1:09:24] God's mercy had been made manifest
[1:09:26] according to the promise had walked with
[1:09:28] them they fished with it they all that
[1:09:30] was in the ship and the boat but now
[1:09:32] that same Mercy that had merged within
[1:09:35] flesh and been manifest to them now that
[1:09:38] same Mercy was now behind their flesh
[1:09:42] amen oh glory be to God and it was
[1:09:45] helping them along the
[1:09:47] way oh my watch this we talk about this
[1:09:50] flame of fire how many knows when Moses
[1:09:52] went and he saw that Bush the mo Moses
[1:09:55] was absolutely attracted and taken away
[1:09:58] because he saw this bush on fire but yet
[1:10:00] it wasn't
[1:10:01] burning right brother BR says this in
[1:10:04] the angel of the Lord in 1951 he says
[1:10:07] now he said when he spoke God spoke to
[1:10:09] him attracted his attention by a pillar
[1:10:11] of fire that fell into a bush and began
[1:10:13] to burn and pop and burn it looks like
[1:10:15] if it was a fire it would have scorched
[1:10:17] the bush or burn it but it was a
[1:10:19] supernatural fire who could burn the
[1:10:22] bush and yet it would still will be
[1:10:24] there oh he said I'm thankful tonight
[1:10:26] for a supernatural the Holy Spirit God's
[1:10:29] flame of fire who could come down in the
[1:10:32] human heart burn out all the sin and
[1:10:34] unbelief don't harm the person but it
[1:10:36] purges him and makes him grow greater be
[1:10:40] stronger more faith and he comes tonight
[1:10:42] in that way oh he said he can come down
[1:10:45] into a human body drive out the power of
[1:10:48] cancer tumor cataract tuberculosis with
[1:10:51] fire Heavenly Holy Spirit fire falling
[1:10:54] from God out of Heaven why that's no M
[1:10:56] mystery if he can burn inbred sin out
[1:11:00] how much more can he burn cancer out by
[1:11:03] the same Holy
[1:11:06] Spirit you see this is why the coming of
[1:11:09] the holy spirit is not trying to perfect
[1:11:11] this when it gets burned out here this
[1:11:15] will reflect what's in
[1:11:20] hereall now watch this how our God is a
[1:11:23] consuming fire on and on through the
[1:11:25] scriptures we could take that with
[1:11:26] Elijah on Mount Carmel Moses as we said
[1:11:29] there Gideon we could speak of that
[1:11:31] Samson's daddy manoah after the angel of
[1:11:34] the Lord had revealed the order of the
[1:11:36] child then he was was lifted up fire he
[1:11:38] consumed the offering but you know when
[1:11:40] you think of it that your life at one
[1:11:43] time look how Paul writes this at one
[1:11:45] time you and I were Darkness not
[1:11:48] sometimes not not you were in darkness
[1:11:50] we were
[1:11:52] Darkness but he said says now are ye
[1:11:55] light in the Lord not you're in it it's
[1:11:59] in
[1:12:00] you you are light in other words light
[1:12:03] is the manifestation of God's spoken
[1:12:06] word in other words your life is the
[1:12:09] manifestation of Christ in this hour
[1:12:12] amen my my my now watch this let me just
[1:12:16] take a few of this because peace itself
[1:12:20] it actually peace will exhibit itself in
[1:12:23] confid confidence and in boldness not
[1:12:25] arrogance but confidence and boldness
[1:12:28] that's what peace does now watch this
[1:12:30] brother Brandman 1964 questions and
[1:12:32] answers he says when you're filled with
[1:12:35] the spirit here's one of the best signs
[1:12:37] I know you're so in love with Christ and
[1:12:40] believe every word that he says to be
[1:12:43] the truth now if I just stopped on the
[1:12:45] first part be so in love with Christ
[1:12:47] many people can love Christ the Christ
[1:12:50] of their
[1:12:51] imagination that that God who is you
[1:12:54] know he just when he walks honey just
[1:12:56] seeps out of him that he loves me so
[1:12:58] much he he don't care about my life and
[1:13:00] he knows I can't live Victorious that's
[1:13:02] not the right kind of love that's you
[1:13:04] trying to love God With Your Love but
[1:13:06] the Bible said we love him agap him
[1:13:09] because he first Agape loved us God we
[1:13:13] cannot love God with our FAL love it'll
[1:13:16] fall off the wagon we must have the love
[1:13:19] of God which is the fire of God which is
[1:13:22] the Holy Ghost God's flame burning in
[1:13:25] our
[1:13:26] hearts oh my you're so in love with
[1:13:29] Christ and believe every word that he
[1:13:32] says to be the truth so if there's a
[1:13:34] spirit in you that resists the word
[1:13:36] that's not the Holy
[1:13:38] Spirit that's the evidence that you have
[1:13:41] the Holy Spirit and your life's full of
[1:13:45] joy oh my everything's different than
[1:13:48] what it used to be that's the Holy
[1:13:50] Spirit Well brother Samuel you have to
[1:13:52] tell you what I'm so down in the Molly
[1:13:54] grubs well the problem is not with God
[1:13:57] right amen amen if you've got the Holy
[1:14:00] Spirit maybe you're the one who's gotten
[1:14:02] awake and got cold but there's a way to
[1:14:05] have the joy restored back to you come
[1:14:08] back and do the first Works come back
[1:14:10] come back where you left him come back
[1:14:11] where you drifted from him notice in the
[1:14:14] message the Good Shepherd of the sheep I
[1:14:16] love this quote brother brandom do you
[1:14:18] mean to tell me you believe if a man is
[1:14:21] really a child of God that he really
[1:14:23] really can know that he's a child of God
[1:14:26] I said absolutely when your spirit quote
[1:14:28] in Romans 8 when your spirit Bears
[1:14:30] record with his word and his Spirit you
[1:14:33] are Sons and Daughters of God when your
[1:14:37] experience comes into God's Bible and
[1:14:39] you met every requirement and God has
[1:14:42] proved to you and all the world has
[1:14:44] passed away you become a new creature
[1:14:47] then you've passed from Death unto life
[1:14:50] God has did it amen what are we talking
[1:14:54] about responses to his Mercy amen
[1:14:58] responses to his Mercy in the message
[1:15:01] Abraham it's everything absolutely
[1:15:04] positive a man that becomes a child of
[1:15:07] God has a positive hold on Calvary and
[1:15:09] Calvary has a positive hold on him with
[1:15:12] the Assurance by almighty God by an oath
[1:15:15] to himself that he will raise him up in
[1:15:18] the last days and take him to Glory
[1:15:20] there's not no if or and or nothing it's
[1:15:23] something that's positive let me finish
[1:15:25] the quote now you can be mentally worked
[1:15:28] up or emotionally worked up and just
[1:15:31] imagine your faith but when your spirit
[1:15:34] Bears record with his Spirit remember
[1:15:37] his spirit is his word they do not work
[1:15:40] in con contrary they work in harmony
[1:15:43] it's the spirit of Truth when he is come
[1:15:47] amen he will lead and guide you into all
[1:15:50] truth are you with me notice when your
[1:15:53] life Compares with God's Bible you've
[1:15:55] got a pretty good conception it's all at
[1:15:58] peace but if it don't compare with that
[1:16:01] then you better come back again if you
[1:16:03] don't love him with all your heart and
[1:16:05] with all your soul and with all your
[1:16:07] mind if sin doesn't just make you
[1:16:10] tremble at the thoughts of it You'
[1:16:12] better come back and be
[1:16:15] sure what is that your spirit bearing
[1:16:18] witness with his spirit amen with his
[1:16:20] word then you have a god given
[1:16:24] authority to act as a son and daughter
[1:16:26] of God now watch
[1:16:29] this and Peter and them come out of the
[1:16:32] upper room here they are they're filled
[1:16:35] right the fire of God has issued down
[1:16:38] into their lives it's quickened that
[1:16:41] life now they were not just around the
[1:16:44] message they were not just around the
[1:16:45] resurrected Lord Jesus Christ it was not
[1:16:48] just something that they could talk
[1:16:49] about the stories and testimonies but
[1:16:52] they had had the same they had a part of
[1:16:55] that same Lord Jesus by the spirit of
[1:16:58] God dwelling in their
[1:17:01] lives to where that they themselves
[1:17:04] could testify he is the Christ you
[1:17:07] realize when the scripture says that
[1:17:09] when they came out of the upper room
[1:17:12] when they came out they gathered at that
[1:17:14] time all the Jews from different places
[1:17:16] around because it was a feast time Feast
[1:17:18] of Passover one of the feasts where all
[1:17:20] the males were to come together and
[1:17:22] present themselves and here they were
[1:17:23] and when they came out of the upper room
[1:17:25] and begin to speak the Fulfillment of
[1:17:28] the word that the atonement the true
[1:17:31] Passover Lamb had come been offered up
[1:17:34] and now the life in that lamb had now
[1:17:36] come in response to the Fulfillment of
[1:17:40] Pentecost and when they spoke the Bible
[1:17:42] said how hear we every man in our own
[1:17:45] tongue so the miracle itself was not the
[1:17:49] speaking they were not speaking in
[1:17:51] unknown tongues they were speaking
[1:17:53] speaking in their own
[1:17:56] language but the spirit of God was
[1:17:59] breaking it down in the hearing of the
[1:18:02] others how hear we every man in our own
[1:18:06] language is that right now notice this
[1:18:09] right here this is you see there's so
[1:18:10] many wonderful Parts within that God was
[1:18:13] even showing his Mercy that his Mercy
[1:18:16] will be taken to Every Nation every
[1:18:20] tongue will have their chance at the
[1:18:23] fresh word of God that the holy spirit
[1:18:25] is no respector persons he will visit
[1:18:29] and declare himself to every tongue my
[1:18:33] my my my my notice this in Acts chap 2
[1:18:37] verse 36 therefore P Peter stepping out
[1:18:40] let all the house of Israel know
[1:18:42] assuredly that God hath made that same
[1:18:44] Jesus whom you crucified both Lord and
[1:18:46] Christ when they heard this now watch
[1:18:49] this response when they heard this they
[1:18:52] were were pricked Amen in their
[1:18:55] heart now remember chapters later
[1:18:59] Stephen is preaching the same thing
[1:19:03] right and the Bible says those Pharisees
[1:19:06] that heard him were pricked in their
[1:19:10] heart it was different though the
[1:19:12] response was different to God's
[1:19:15] mercy and Peter said you do always
[1:19:20] resist the Holy Ghost as your fathers
[1:19:24] did so do you what were they resisting
[1:19:28] they were resisting the very God they
[1:19:31] claimed to believe in the very God they
[1:19:34] were resisting his Mercy listen to me
[1:19:39] God was not resisting them God was
[1:19:41] showing his
[1:19:45] mercy God was showing his Mercy if you
[1:19:48] probably had to count I wonder how many
[1:19:50] Believers were standing there that day
[1:19:52] when Peter G or when Steven gave that
[1:19:54] exhortation it might have just been a
[1:19:56] handful cuz it was only just a small
[1:19:58] amount but the majority was that of the
[1:20:00] religious of that day God was not
[1:20:03] resisting them they resisted God do you
[1:20:06] realize God don't send any man to hell
[1:20:09] or woman they send themselves there by
[1:20:12] the choices they make and overrun God
[1:20:15] will put barrier after barrier roadblock
[1:20:18] after roadblock he'll deal with the
[1:20:20] heart again and again and again
[1:20:24] I tell you when you keep turning it down
[1:20:26] the voice starts getting less and
[1:20:31] less it'd be just like them turning down
[1:20:33] this microphone it keeps getting lower
[1:20:34] and lower and lower and lower and lower
[1:20:37] till eventually you're able to
[1:20:39] completely override it oh may God be
[1:20:42] merciful May there not be one of us here
[1:20:45] notice in verse 37 when they heard this
[1:20:48] they were pricked in their heart and
[1:20:50] said to Peter and to the rest of the
[1:20:51] Apostles men and Brethren what shall we
[1:20:54] do see that's always the question when
[1:20:57] the when the mercy of God is being shown
[1:20:59] then it always brings out like Paul what
[1:21:01] would you have me do Lord show me lead
[1:21:03] me see immediately you know that's
[1:21:05] equality even when Joshua was standing
[1:21:08] before Jericho when the Great captain of
[1:21:10] the Lord's host that Pillar of Fire had
[1:21:12] become a man and he stood right there to
[1:21:14] lead him into battle as soon as Joshua
[1:21:17] recognized who it was he fell on his
[1:21:19] face and said what would you have your
[1:21:21] servant do when when Abraham met MDC in
[1:21:24] the Valley of the plain of the Kings
[1:21:27] what did he do he gave himself and he
[1:21:29] worshiped is that right showing what
[1:21:32] every son and daughter of God would do
[1:21:35] in the end time when MDC is made
[1:21:38] manifest in our midst do you see it's
[1:21:40] something about it that as the word is
[1:21:43] being fulfilled it passes over vessels
[1:21:46] and that Mercy makes known and it draws
[1:21:49] out a vessel where the mercy joins
[1:21:51] itself to it joins itself to do what
[1:21:54] lead us in justification lead us in
[1:21:56] sanctification lead us into the baptism
[1:21:59] of the Holy Ghost and lead us to the
[1:22:01] change of the body my Lord have
[1:22:03] mercy I'm telling you God who is rich in
[1:22:09] Mercy here's this formula what shall we
[1:22:12] do repent and be baptized every one of
[1:22:16] you in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:22:20] remission of sins and you shall receive
[1:22:25] the gift of the Holy Ghost no maybe's
[1:22:28] there for the promise is unto you and to
[1:22:31] your children and to all that are far
[1:22:33] off even as many as the Lord Our God
[1:22:35] shall call now watch's this in response
[1:22:38] watch watch how brother R will make some
[1:22:40] statements here I want you to keep keep
[1:22:42] this in mind there's a lot maybe a lot
[1:22:44] within the thought of it but I want you
[1:22:46] to keep this in mind on response brother
[1:22:48] BR says our heavenly father it's such a
[1:22:51] lovely group of people they're so
[1:22:53] responsive we're so happy Lord ministers
[1:22:56] to be able to see people who respond to
[1:22:58] the gospel it means there's a sign a
[1:23:02] sound of a rushing wind in the air so
[1:23:06] when hearts are responding now it may
[1:23:09] not be altogether physically something
[1:23:11] that will be seen but what's important
[1:23:14] is that our hearts respond to him and
[1:23:18] that you obey what he is asking you to
[1:23:21] do
[1:23:23] is that all right notice testimony uh uh
[1:23:27] raising a dead boy boy I'm glad that
[1:23:28] brother Bri was able to kind of maneuver
[1:23:29] that stuff back there and get these
[1:23:31] up brother man was talking to a lady
[1:23:33] with female trouble he says you believe
[1:23:35] me with all your heart I'm afraid I'm
[1:23:37] not catching you you're missing it I see
[1:23:40] it come to you and you don't respond to
[1:23:42] the call and as and and as soon as you
[1:23:45] do it moves from you cause that faith
[1:23:48] has to catch it then you get in your
[1:23:50] mind notice you get in your mind your
[1:23:52] wondering if it's to somebody else and
[1:23:55] it's
[1:23:57] you God are you talking to me Lord are
[1:24:01] you speaking to me and because she's not
[1:24:04] reaching out and recognizing hey if
[1:24:06] there ain't nobody else if this thing
[1:24:08] was filled with thousands of people when
[1:24:11] I feel that tug in my heart that's God
[1:24:15] speaking personally to
[1:24:18] me but because she wasn't responding to
[1:24:20] it reaching out and grabbing in faith
[1:24:23] instead her mind was wondering I wonder
[1:24:25] if it's me I wonder if it's
[1:24:28] me and it's you notice this brother B is
[1:24:32] talking in demonology a religious realm
[1:24:35] he's talking about a man that he's just
[1:24:37] been brought to his attention from a
[1:24:39] previous service and brother Bram is
[1:24:41] talking about how that a person must
[1:24:43] respond he says then if that person
[1:24:46] don't respond talking about when the
[1:24:47] angel of the Lord is moving Visions are
[1:24:49] being called out things that he's
[1:24:51] Discerning the hearts if that person
[1:24:53] don't respond he said it'd be like
[1:24:55] reading the Bible here and saying
[1:24:57] nothing to it and walk away from it so
[1:24:59] that makes it pretty bad so be on alert
[1:25:03] be listening be watching when he speaks
[1:25:07] answer just be ready to answer at any
[1:25:13] time oh my oh Lord you don't know I I've
[1:25:18] got so cold on you why let the coldness
[1:25:20] keep you back it's a time that you can
[1:25:22] move up by the fire it's a time you can
[1:25:24] let the fire come back in it's a time to
[1:25:26] rekindle the love of God in your life
[1:25:30] are you hearing me how does that happen
[1:25:32] by being ready Lord I'm going to lay
[1:25:34] that aside I'm going to take in Lord
[1:25:36] into my life Lord to respond to this
[1:25:39] word that's being spoken right here you
[1:25:42] are dealing with My Heart Lord and I'm
[1:25:45] going to respond to your
[1:25:48] mercy oh brother BR goes on to talk
[1:25:51] about this this gentleman he said so he
[1:25:53] said they were telling me he said this I
[1:25:55] was calling out this man and something
[1:25:57] about the brother he had something wrong
[1:25:58] with him and so forth and the man did
[1:26:00] not respond to the call so that can't be
[1:26:03] helped that's between God and the man
[1:26:06] the vision left me I couldn't find it no
[1:26:08] more because he didn't answer so be
[1:26:10] watching be on alert brother Bram kept
[1:26:13] watching for that light to come back
[1:26:15] over that man but that light wasn't
[1:26:17] coming back over that man that man had
[1:26:20] missed his opportunity
[1:26:23] right because he did not respond to the
[1:26:26] mercy of God now listen we understand
[1:26:29] when we come in here brother Ram tells
[1:26:31] us very clearly questions and answers on
[1:26:33] the Holy Ghost when the sons of God get
[1:26:35] together he said Satan gets right there
[1:26:37] among them too spirits will get right
[1:26:40] here among you realize spirits will try
[1:26:42] to take your mind put it on things of of
[1:26:44] the of the world and of the earth and of
[1:26:46] your job and this and that it'll even
[1:26:49] take listen sometimes it's not even on
[1:26:51] sinful things if Satan can just get your
[1:26:54] mind distracted enough you can miss what
[1:26:58] God is pulsating to you and God in his
[1:27:02] Mercy how many times that brother B
[1:27:04] would say it over and over oh lord
[1:27:06] they're going to miss it lord they're
[1:27:07] going to miss it Lord help me Lord and
[1:27:08] then God in his grace would call out
[1:27:11] that person's name why so it didn't miss
[1:27:14] him
[1:27:15] amen listen I believe in God's grace I I
[1:27:19] know it works that way amen but I
[1:27:22] believe that as children of God if we
[1:27:24] can take what God is saying to us Lord I
[1:27:26] don't want to have to come and sit here
[1:27:28] after service and you've got to call my
[1:27:30] name I want to be ready I want to be
[1:27:33] alert I want to respond to the mercy of
[1:27:38] God is that right notice show us the
[1:27:42] father and it'll satisfy what about it
[1:27:44] sir with that prostrate trouble sitting
[1:27:47] up there nervous you're sitting up there
[1:27:49] looking at me see the man lost his
[1:27:51] healing right there it moved away and
[1:27:53] turned dark around him again he didn't
[1:27:55] catch it you got to answer when the Holy
[1:27:57] Ghost is speaking to you answer sure he
[1:28:01] wants you to answer him it's your faith
[1:28:04] answering to the respond of the word it
[1:28:08] was turning light around the man I was
[1:28:09] trying to get his attention he's
[1:28:11] somewhere sitting in there but it left
[1:28:13] him and went away I called him and I
[1:28:16] pointed right to him but it turned dark
[1:28:18] around the man and the vision left me it
[1:28:21] went back to him went back from him he
[1:28:24] says you can't Bluff God you can't Bluff
[1:28:26] Satan you've got to know that God has
[1:28:28] the preeminence he's God think about
[1:28:31] this a response to the word
[1:28:35] right now watch how brother Ram would
[1:28:38] put this in Hebrews chapter 3 he says
[1:28:44] now don't just go away from church today
[1:28:46] and say well I kind of enjoy going down
[1:28:50] there I I like the sing and the people
[1:28:53] all friendly around that little old
[1:28:54] church don't do that brother let your
[1:28:58] heart become a flame and say here I got
[1:29:02] to do something about this I got to get
[1:29:04] out and see if I can get
[1:29:06] somebody
[1:29:08] saved this is what the flame of God will
[1:29:13] also move within your heart or brother
[1:29:16] time you know I I can't lay everything
[1:29:18] out listen God God will only require a
[1:29:22] of you what he has required of you God's
[1:29:25] not going to require of you to be a
[1:29:26] preacher to be a minister if that's not
[1:29:29] what he's called you to be and and to
[1:29:31] tell you the truth listen even with
[1:29:32] where you're at you might be the newest
[1:29:35] of Christian and you might say how could
[1:29:37] I witness God will take the testimony of
[1:29:40] how your candle got lit and he will
[1:29:42] cause that testimony to speak to
[1:29:45] somebody else's life God's not going to
[1:29:47] put you in a place of failure but God
[1:29:49] will use your testimony that you have
[1:29:52] have right now if you just will yield it
[1:29:54] to
[1:29:56] him is that all right now I'm looking at
[1:30:00] this this in response to his Mercy I
[1:30:03] want you to look at this here many times
[1:30:04] you know many different places I've been
[1:30:06] studying through the book of Acts and
[1:30:08] the falling of the Holy Ghost and
[1:30:09] looking at through all of these through
[1:30:11] all of these different accounts and you
[1:30:13] know when we look here I want to take
[1:30:15] one one account right here this morning
[1:30:18] in that of a sister by the name of Lydia
[1:30:20] A lot of times it's not read too much
[1:30:22] about matter of fact brother bandam only
[1:30:24] mentions it uh the one time there in the
[1:30:26] church age book refers to it even of
[1:30:28] what many scholars will say that they
[1:30:30] don't know whether she's Jew or Gentile
[1:30:31] she was one of Paul's first European
[1:30:33] converts but I want you to notice
[1:30:35] something here in Acts chapter 16:2 this
[1:30:38] is what I want you to notice the burden
[1:30:40] that when God had so touched their lives
[1:30:43] the fire of God's love burnt within
[1:30:46] their hearts to where they had one
[1:30:47] objective and that one objective was was
[1:30:50] to serve God with all their heart hearts
[1:30:52] and to take that same fire and be able
[1:30:55] to see that fire be imp parted into the
[1:30:58] lives of
[1:30:59] others that's Godlike aren't you glad
[1:31:02] that God came down from glory for you
[1:31:04] and I aren't you glad for that well see
[1:31:06] when Redemption strikes our heart we act
[1:31:09] like God it isn't me or you as far as I
[1:31:12] can walk up to a person and say hey I'm
[1:31:14] going to give you the Holy Ghost but the
[1:31:16] Holy Ghost will pass through the
[1:31:19] body is that right there were angels
[1:31:21] that came to Cornelius but the Angels
[1:31:23] did not give him the Holy Ghost is that
[1:31:26] right and look the Phillip the the unic
[1:31:28] was reading was reading there in the
[1:31:30] scriptures is that right but God took
[1:31:32] lifted up Phillip out of the Revival
[1:31:33] Samaria and had him go join himself to
[1:31:36] that Chariot where that unic was at and
[1:31:38] the unic was reading Isaiah 53 and
[1:31:40] Philip said do you know what you're
[1:31:42] reading he said he said I need how can I
[1:31:44] except some man Teach me so the spirit
[1:31:46] of God inside of Phillip begin to
[1:31:49] expound and bring from prophecy into the
[1:31:53] Fulfillment of the word of God and that
[1:31:56] unic raised up and said hey I need to be
[1:31:59] baptized right here's water what's
[1:32:02] stopping us he responded to God's
[1:32:06] mercy this is this is what it's all
[1:32:08] about now notice this in Lydia's house
[1:32:11] the Bible tells us that from F to
[1:32:14] Philippi in verse 12 of act 16 which is
[1:32:17] the chief city of that part of Macedonia
[1:32:20] and a colony we were in the city abiding
[1:32:22] certain days and on the Sabbath we went
[1:32:24] out of the city by a Riverside where RI
[1:32:27] where prayer was want to be made and we
[1:32:30] sat down and spake unto the women which
[1:32:33] resorted fither now here here uh here
[1:32:37] they are those of the Jews whether Lydia
[1:32:39] was a Jew or not she was a prolite here
[1:32:41] they are meeting next to the river just
[1:32:44] a small handful of people when you look
[1:32:47] and begin to look in through and study
[1:32:48] that within history if there would have
[1:32:50] been at least 10 Jewish men they would
[1:32:51] had a synagogue but you see the women
[1:32:53] are not counted amongst that number but
[1:32:55] to think here they were just a small
[1:32:58] group of people this is what struck my
[1:33:00] heart that from this small group of
[1:33:02] people God would raise up a church till
[1:33:04] Paul would mention it in the book of
[1:33:07] Philippians to the churches that are in
[1:33:09] Philippi oh my it only takes a little
[1:33:12] fire to get more fire going notice this
[1:33:16] and a certain woman named Lydia a seller
[1:33:20] of purple of the city of thara which
[1:33:23] worshiped God H us whose heart the Lord
[1:33:27] opened that's key that she attended unto
[1:33:31] the things which were spoken of Paul so
[1:33:34] she heard him and God opened her heart
[1:33:37] now notice this word she attended unto
[1:33:40] the things that were spoken of Paul this
[1:33:43] word attended means to bring near to
[1:33:45] bring a ship to land and to touch at it
[1:33:49] to put in it means to turn the mind to
[1:33:52] to attend to be attentive to a person or
[1:33:55] a thing of caring for providing for to
[1:33:58] apply oneself to or attach oneself to
[1:34:03] hold or cleave to a person or a thing to
[1:34:07] be given or addicted to to devote
[1:34:10] thought and
[1:34:12] effort she attended to what was
[1:34:16] said now I wonder what our lives would
[1:34:19] be like if we attended more
[1:34:22] to what God's
[1:34:24] saying come on
[1:34:26] friends we know the cares as I said we
[1:34:28] know the cares we know the pressures we
[1:34:30] know things of life but I wonder if if
[1:34:32] we could say Lord let me attend in the
[1:34:35] right way let me attend to the to the
[1:34:38] things of God let me have the right
[1:34:40] response to it in other words Lord I I I
[1:34:43] I don't want to just show up and you
[1:34:44] know I fulfilled a duty and and it's
[1:34:46] just a time then we we leave out of here
[1:34:47] but I want to attend to the things of
[1:34:50] God oh it's getting quiet now we're just
[1:34:54] getting warmed up verse 15 when she was
[1:34:58] baptized look at the result from this
[1:35:00] she was baptized and her household she
[1:35:05] besought us saying if you've judge me to
[1:35:08] be faithful to the Lord come into my
[1:35:12] house and abide there and she
[1:35:14] constrained
[1:35:15] us she was so taken so attended to the
[1:35:20] word of God she said
[1:35:22] if you've counted me to be
[1:35:24] faithful come into my
[1:35:27] houseall this is what the woman of
[1:35:29] zerath did this is what the woman of
[1:35:31] shunum did is that right this is what
[1:35:33] Abraham did invite him come in if you
[1:35:37] judge me to be faithful what is the
[1:35:39] greatest honor I could do for you come
[1:35:42] to my
[1:35:43] home come to my home Lord Jesus be the
[1:35:47] center of my home be the center of my
[1:35:50] family what's the Great greatest honor
[1:35:52] that I could do for you be the sole
[1:35:54] influence of Our Lives
[1:35:58] Lord be the flame Lord that presents it
[1:36:02] notice and who is this mezic brother B
[1:36:04] says he's in prayer as we speak Thy word
[1:36:07] and the promises given to us may we
[1:36:09] nurture them in our hearts cherish them
[1:36:14] with reverence and Obey them with real
[1:36:19] Godly discipline so simply put when God
[1:36:23] speaks to our hearts deals with our
[1:36:25] lives we take that word begin to nurture
[1:36:29] it begin to nurture what is it it's it's
[1:36:31] taking it very close very dear to us
[1:36:33] almost like almost like it's like a baby
[1:36:35] like an infant and you're nurturing it
[1:36:37] you're holding it close to your bosom
[1:36:40] and then as cherishing it by reverencing
[1:36:44] that word not my will thy will be done
[1:36:46] Lord and obeying it with Godly
[1:36:49] discipline where the word word is
[1:36:52] shaping even the conscience in our
[1:36:54] spirit
[1:36:55] realm that Lord my my my feet are going
[1:36:58] to walk this way I might still have
[1:37:00] temptations out here but my feet are
[1:37:02] going to walk according to your word I
[1:37:04] will walk according to your word then
[1:37:06] the spirit of God will move around and
[1:37:08] confirm it in my life and bring it to
[1:37:10] pass is that
[1:37:13] right my my my my my this is what Rahab
[1:37:16] did she received the word into her house
[1:37:18] now let me let me let me get can I have
[1:37:20] one more example
[1:37:22] acts 16:25 Philippian Jailer you're
[1:37:25] familiar with
[1:37:28] him Paul goes right from this event at
[1:37:30] Lydia's
[1:37:32] house and they get thrown in
[1:37:34] jail because there was a woman that had
[1:37:38] a familiar Spirit she was a slave and
[1:37:41] she was speaking for her owners who were
[1:37:44] these gods and so forth they were making
[1:37:46] and when Paul got permission from God to
[1:37:49] cast that thing
[1:37:51] out when they got permission from God
[1:37:54] then it stirred up it stirred up the
[1:37:56] enemy let me just tell you something
[1:37:58] right now when you read through the book
[1:38:00] of Acts every time that God was moving
[1:38:03] in hearts and lives you watch the devil
[1:38:05] get mad let me just say let me just
[1:38:07] quote this to you the devil the prophet
[1:38:10] tells us in Acts of the Holy Spirit he
[1:38:13] said when the Holy Ghost came down and
[1:38:15] filled them on the day of Pentecost the
[1:38:17] devil never even set up on his
[1:38:20] bed
[1:38:22] right never set up on his bed but he
[1:38:25] said when they walked out of that upper
[1:38:27] room and there was that man at the gate
[1:38:30] called beautiful right and they said
[1:38:32] Silver and Gold Have I None but such as
[1:38:35] I have give I unto thee rise up and walk
[1:38:39] he said that got the devil mad right
[1:38:41] there why because that same Mercy had
[1:38:45] dropped and it was not just staying
[1:38:48] there but that vessel was carrying God
[1:38:51] God's mercy to
[1:38:54] others
[1:38:56] Hallelujah so you find in this right
[1:38:59] here that every time the devil raises
[1:39:02] his head you know what he's trying to do
[1:39:05] to get you to shut up he's trying to get
[1:39:08] you to just tap down just just be quiet
[1:39:10] you're all worked up you're all riled up
[1:39:12] let me just tell you something don't
[1:39:14] ever be foolish enough to make a deal
[1:39:16] with the
[1:39:18] devil he'll never keep his end of the
[1:39:20] deal
[1:39:22] if he tells you he'll let up on you
[1:39:24] don't you believe him he won't let up on
[1:39:27] you he'll keep going because if you keep
[1:39:30] giving he'll keep taking what God has
[1:39:32] rightfully given to
[1:39:34] you but when Trouble Comes that's the
[1:39:37] time to stand in that time and realize
[1:39:41] it's Satan trying to distract you from
[1:39:44] the
[1:39:48] promise that's the right response and
[1:39:51] the mercy now notice the Philippi and
[1:39:52] Jailer here they are thrown in
[1:39:56] jail Paul and
[1:39:58] Silas verse 25 and in midnight Paul and
[1:40:04] Silas were
[1:40:06] Facebooking and
[1:40:09] instagramming and tweeting of what a bad
[1:40:12] deal they
[1:40:17] received that must be the updated
[1:40:19] version I don't know
[1:40:26] you think they
[1:40:28] listen they themselves had done nothing
[1:40:30] but good for that woman and that City
[1:40:33] that's right and they were thrown in
[1:40:35] jail now I'm going to tell you they had
[1:40:37] to have it had to be the love of God in
[1:40:39] their heart to where they did not look
[1:40:41] upon those men with disdain because I
[1:40:44] don't care how much they sing I don't
[1:40:45] care how much they clap their hands God
[1:40:47] would have never tapped his
[1:40:49] foot come on somebody God just not tapy
[1:40:53] God wasn't going to come down and say
[1:40:55] man that's some good worship and he said
[1:40:57] but I'm I'm I'm hearing these songs
[1:40:59] going to be a meeting in the air but
[1:41:01] Hallelujah it sound right doesn't sound
[1:41:04] right what's it sound like Lord it
[1:41:05] sounds like a grudges down there oh see
[1:41:10] God can't tap his
[1:41:11] foot you say brother Samuel what what
[1:41:14] about a grudge if you can just let God
[1:41:16] dissolve and take away Grudge and
[1:41:18] bitterness and indifference then I'll
[1:41:20] tell you the spirit of God will break
[1:41:22] down the walls in your life he'll break
[1:41:26] down barriers but it starts with the
[1:41:29] right response Lord I've got a grudge
[1:41:32] Lord I've got bitterness Lord I've got
[1:41:34] indifference Lord I've got sin Lord I
[1:41:37] need help Lord oh you begin to get in
[1:41:41] harmony with his song with his word oh
[1:41:46] there begins to be notes that are
[1:41:47] falling from on high the Angels begin to
[1:41:49] take their position position and here
[1:41:51] God begins to Pat his foot and said
[1:41:54] listen to my children down there singing
[1:41:55] to me there's victory in their life well
[1:41:58] they don't look that Victorious they're
[1:41:59] down there in prison oh no you don't
[1:42:01] understand they have not allowed when
[1:42:04] those men threw them in jail they have
[1:42:06] not allowed that to affect their
[1:42:08] attitude they still are a vessel of
[1:42:12] [Music]

[1:43:06] prison they were just there of that

[1:43:16] flame that was burning in their

[1:43:28] and thou shalt be saved in thy house and
[1:43:31] they spake unto him the word of the Lord
[1:43:34] and to all that were in his
[1:43:36] house you catch this each one of these
[1:43:39] times you'll find in many of these cases
[1:43:41] in the book of Acts even when Cornelius
[1:43:44] was receiving the word he got all his
[1:43:45] Kinsmen together got all his friends
[1:43:48] together he got those that was dear to
[1:43:49] him because he knew we need to hear this

[1:46:13] the congregations your fine response to
[1:46:16] the ministry to the messages great
[1:46:19] things that God has done for us it's
[1:46:22] just unlimited we'll never know what
[1:46:25] it's meant until we cross the other side
[1:46:27] because seed has been planted that will
[1:46:32] come to life in the days ahead of us see
[1:46:36] the confidence in the word when the seed
[1:46:39] has been planted it may not be at that
[1:46:42] moment that it comes to life but when
[1:46:44] that seed has been received a promise of
[1:46:47] God and is
[1:46:49] watered it will will come to
[1:46:52] life it will come to life notice he goes
[1:46:56] on for those who rais their hands to
[1:46:58] Christ for the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:47:00] and many things The Works of Grace that
[1:47:02] you desired God to work on with you I
[1:47:04] trust that every one of You' be filled
[1:47:05] with the Holy Ghost everyone don't
[1:47:07] forget my message on the token he said
[1:47:09] you must stay with it remember display
[1:47:12] the token Mighty God unveil before us he
[1:47:15] says we must become more dedicated we
[1:47:20] must must believe every word of God and
[1:47:23] we must seek everybody say seek seek
[1:47:27] until that word is made real to
[1:47:31] us and the message doors IND door and
[1:47:34] this is these are just some things that
[1:47:36] just been some burden and I had no idea
[1:47:38] how Lord was going to take it had no
[1:47:40] matter of fact I just had a note I'm
[1:47:41] just just speak from my heart right now
[1:47:43] I just had a note that I've had out for
[1:47:45] a little bit a little while and it was
[1:47:46] just a note to speak to the congregation
[1:47:49] on responding to the word responding in
[1:47:53] the service and the after service now I
[1:47:54] I'll tell you it's I to me I don't love
[1:47:57] preaching I love preaching here more
[1:47:58] than I love preaching anywhere else this
[1:47:59] is my home this is home it's a liberty
[1:48:02] to preach the word of God I'm thankful
[1:48:04] that other other ministers they come and
[1:48:06] they feel the same way to do that but
[1:48:08] that's you know what that's because of
[1:48:10] hearts and lives that want to glean and
[1:48:12] draw on the word of God it ain't the
[1:48:14] temperature it ain't the music it's
[1:48:16] because of hearts that love God let me
[1:48:18] tell you something you realize if
[1:48:20] there's only three hearts that love God
[1:48:22] three hearts sitting in a room of a
[1:48:24] hundred can make a man of God feel at
[1:48:27] home come on God doesn't have to have a
[1:48:29] crowd God God does not have to do that
[1:48:31] God can take just a few hearts that are
[1:48:34] in tune with him and they there gets to
[1:48:36] start working together like a body it
[1:48:38] will have an effect upon the rest of the
[1:48:41] others that are joined in there that's
[1:48:43] why listen to me don't be looking at one

[1:49:53] altar well I'm not guilty of sin you
[1:49:56] don't always come sometimes you come to

[1:50:01] sin sometimes you come to the altar you

[1:50:17] Lord enter into his Gates enter his
[1:50:20] courts with Thanksgiving that is one of
[1:50:21] the things where they would take what
[1:50:23] God had blessed them with and sit down
[1:50:25] and eat that with the
[1:50:28] priest everybody with me amen I'm
[1:50:31] talking about a simple response CU
[1:50:33] sometimes we can become so technical
[1:50:35] sometimes you and let me tell you
[1:50:36] there's a lot of voices there's a lot of
[1:50:38] voices and and this and voices saying oh
[1:50:41] we're we're Beyond prayer lines that's
[1:50:42] it's nonsense we're not Beyond prayer
[1:50:44] lines amen I you see certain things
[1:50:47] where people they want to take certain
[1:50:48] things and take quotes and I listen
[1:50:50] friends I'm not I'm not the authority on
[1:50:52] this but I'll tell you what is God's
[1:50:54] word God's word not just taking one
[1:50:57] quote here and cherry picking them but
[1:50:58] let's look through the whole message
[1:51:00] because it's not going to contrary one
[1:51:02] to the
[1:51:03] other now to my heart my heart when I
[1:51:05] look at it we want to respond as God
[1:51:07] moves on our heart we want to respond to
[1:51:09] his Mercy not saying Lord I'm above all
[1:51:11] that I'm above this or I'm above that
[1:51:13] neither am I trying to get you to an
[1:51:15] altar neither am I trying to get you to
[1:51:17] come and stand up here but I am telling
[1:51:19] you this when God moves on your heart be
[1:51:22] obedient to
[1:51:24] him that's and listen listen no more you
[1:51:27] don't have to ask me can I come here to
[1:51:29] the altar can I come and be prayed for
[1:51:30] you don't have to ask me that no more
[1:51:32] than you have to ask me can you go visit
[1:51:34] another
[1:51:35] church
[1:51:37] hallu come on
[1:51:41] friends now let me read this let me read
[1:51:43] two more quotes you said Brother Sam you
[1:51:45] said two I want to read these two and
[1:51:46] drop them for you how many believe the
[1:51:48] after service is important
[1:51:52] and I know I've went a little longer
[1:51:54] here into that after service today but I
[1:51:56] wanted to drop this to
[1:51:58] us brother brm says now as we sing
[1:52:01] slowly now doors and door
[1:52:03] 1965 from the bottom of your heart you
[1:52:05] know after a scouring scolding message I
[1:52:10] think it's good to get in the spirit and
[1:52:13] sing the sweetness of the Holy
[1:52:17] Spirit sometimes I wonder how much that
[1:52:20] we miss because we get in such a
[1:52:23] hurry we get in such a hurry to
[1:52:25] leave now I and listen I I understand I
[1:52:29] understand sometimes there's schedules I
[1:52:30] I get that friends but if we could think
[1:52:32] of any of us if there's any of us if
[1:52:34] there's anything within us could think
[1:52:35] could I do things a little differently
[1:52:38] instead of coming this extreme time
[1:52:40] could I well attack a little bit more at
[1:52:42] the end
[1:52:42] what I'm just asking that we would
[1:52:45] really consider that and just just think
[1:52:47] about these things so I'm not sitting
[1:52:49] here taking notes who's leaving early
[1:52:51] y'all with me that's not what I'm saying
[1:52:53] this so don't take it that way I'm just
[1:52:55] saying that sometimes it's just brother
[1:52:56] brand would say it over and over after
[1:52:58] the seed gets planted it's important for
[1:53:00] the water to come on it it's important
[1:53:03] for that water to come upon that seed
[1:53:05] and just water it in real good in the
[1:53:08] message inside brother Bram talks about
[1:53:10] the early church and in that second
[1:53:12] paragraph he says concerning that early
[1:53:14] church he says they would raise up their
[1:53:17] hands after some godly man gave a
[1:53:19] message
[1:53:20] and they raised up their hands and
[1:53:21] praised God they loved the after effects
[1:53:26] of the Holy Spirit bathing through them
[1:53:30] don't you love the after effects don't
[1:53:32] you love it the Lord is so mindful of us
[1:53:36] we want to respond to his Mercy when God
[1:53:40] deals with your heart look it don't have
[1:53:41] to be me standing here preaching you
[1:53:43] it's important that you catch that it's
[1:53:45] God and when God's speaking to you
[1:53:48] respond to his Mercy
[1:53:50] say Lord here here here's my cup Lord
[1:53:52] here's my life Lord I I I Lord I I give
[1:53:55] it to you and
[1:53:57] Lord like
[1:53:59] Lydia like the Philippian Jailer I want
[1:54:02] to take home with me right what I've
[1:54:06] received I want to carry it into my home
[1:54:10] if you've judged me faithful Lord let it
[1:54:12] so drop in my life to where Lord I I
[1:54:16] want to see it made flesh in me I I I
[1:54:19] want to I want to dedicate myself to
[1:54:21] this word more Lord I want to seek Until
[1:54:25] It's Made Real Lord I I I want to
[1:54:27] rededicate but R would say it over and
[1:54:30] over he says how many of you feel like
[1:54:31] me Lord I'm going to rededicate myself
[1:54:35] after hearing this
[1:54:37] word I say Lord Jesus Grant
[1:54:40] it I tell you friends it's no no better
[1:54:43] time when the Holy Spirit deals with you
[1:54:44] maybe on water baptism maybe you've
[1:54:47] never you've never given your heart to
[1:54:48] God maybe You' have never received the
[1:54:50] Holy Ghost let me just tell you you
[1:54:52] respond to him as he speaks to you
[1:54:56] because what that is it's God creating
[1:54:59] it's a faith that then when you step out
[1:55:02] you're stepping on a promise where God
[1:55:05] himself has given you a faith to
[1:55:08] actually believe that promise so it's
[1:55:11] not a man it's not somebody else it's
[1:55:13] between you and God let me just say this
[1:55:16] don't let don't let a moment pass you by
[1:55:20] if you look in your life and say I don't
[1:55:22] really brother Samuel I don't believe
[1:55:23] I've really got that that fire where the
[1:55:26] things of the world have been cleansed
[1:55:28] out of my heart and my life and
[1:55:30] Christ my love is to him and him alone
[1:55:34] where there's a genuine faith in the
[1:55:36] word of God there is a Grace in your
[1:55:39] life that gives you the strength the
[1:55:41] desires of the world are gone the desire
[1:55:44] of the world is gone and your only
[1:55:46] desire is I want to please
[1:55:48] him that that's your love and Devotion
[1:55:50] to Christ and if that's if that's not
[1:55:53] there why don't you just say Lord Jesus
[1:55:57] who's rich and mercy Lord as you've come
[1:55:59] near my life I want to be joined with
