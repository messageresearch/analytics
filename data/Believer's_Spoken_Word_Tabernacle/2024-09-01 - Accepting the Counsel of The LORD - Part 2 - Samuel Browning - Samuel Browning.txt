presence am can so change our lives just a moment in his presence can give release to us the answers that we need amen it's it's unlimited to what God will do amen we just want to say Lord help me to Step Beyond this physical address amen and we've uh entered in and just to create an atmosphere for him to come you know an an atmosphere itself is more than just what we do with our hands or if the right notes are played on there but you know what creates an atmosphere is what we think on what we meditate on remember how God told he told Joshua meditate on those things you know why because it creates an atmosphere but to meditate on what on the word and it creates an atmosphere Hallelujah the Bible said draw nine to me and I'll draw nine to you and as we begin to think about him well then that that's where our clap comes from that's right that's where our shout comes from however it is that you worship him but it's it's based on what he is to you and so that is what creates the atmosphere in then that atmosphere is set and and you know what that atmosphere is it's because of the word that we have received in our life that has changed us just like it did in Genesis 1 and we think upon that word and I tell you what no matter what our troubles is cuz we come in here and we sit and sometimes we're discouraged it's true it's true we're we're not superhuman sometimes we are facing things decisions and everything else but you know we begin to think about what God has done for us because it's the word that is done for us in our lives no matter where you're standing at now even standing with potential in your life it's the word of God that has brought you to that place that's right amen and as we begin to think upon that word you know that's when Israel they came back into the land and my after the gates were erected NE Nehemiah they the Bible said they built a pull pit that's the first only time you ever hear that word mentioned a pull pit and Ezra and then begin to take the law and the Bible says they begin to give understanding to what was wrote in there and the word so touched their lives that they begin to weep you see notice the order the word itself even in the revealing of the word in this hour it brings repentance right it brings humility but then the word directs us and say wait a minute I I don't want you to live just there that's the beginning but then he came and said this is the time of Joy this is the time of the Feast of Tabernacles reminded we're in these temporary dwellings we're dwelling here in this temporary dwelling he said but this is the time for rejoicing and that scripture that we quote no doubt we've seen it on t-shirts bumper stickers we've quoted it so much but it didn't come out of the book of Psalms it came from that moment where they directed the hearts of the people to said the joy of the Lord that's right is our strength yes sir and you know what that Joy is is what he has already done for you he gives you a joy that the world cannot give and and no matter what you might feel like with tests and trials but it really it can't take it away when David said restore unto me the joy of thy salvation it was there it just needed God to bring it forth amen don't you love him this morning oh we we we we know we know where we're standing by God's grace amen we want to uh this morning as the Brothers prepare uh to come and I know it wasn't announced over and over but we may mention about that special offering toward the parking lot I know God bless you no doubt many have continued to just write on the envelopes and you can continue to do that uh throughout uh oncoming weeks and and so forth uh some of you maybe send it in through uh your bank and things like that um so we just wanted to do that today and the reason is I I was saying when we looked at the things that we have set up to do is and we continue to live lift up um offerings and continue to take that because anytime you get into something there's always extra costs and those are things we're also trying to offset and head off as we're going along as well and so um let's just we want as the brothers would come and and I apologize that it wasn't continually U announced here on a Sunday and um I'll take responsibility for that um that I should have probably put that as a reminder and continued to send that out and have the song leaders to do it and then if they would have forgot I'd have had somebody to blame but uh could we just let's just pray over it let's the brothers if you'll come and let's just pray I want to pray before we lift it because I want to thank God for what he's already done cuz I tell you it's already been Supernatural you hear me it's already been Supernatural amen Heavenly Father Lord we just come before you this morning and we want to say that we love you father we are so thankful for your grace and mercy Lord Upon Our Lives and Lord how that you have directed us to this place and to this moment Lord we just Lord even as we prepare to open the word and to look into the word father I'm just asking this morning that you'll take the book lord you'll take our lives Lord and may you just speak to us Lord in a very personal way minister to our hearts Lord the things that we have need of Lord as we've come and gathered here Lord that you would speak to our hearts Lord that Lord our hearts Lord that if there's anything that would be out of place or any hindrance Lord we ask Lord that that would be removed we want to lay that aside because we know that God within the word of God there is power there is transforming power Lord to take Lord situations to take Lord places rivers that are even thought to be uncrossable and that God you can move down in a moment's time and give us Lord a courage maybe not that we would see the water parted but you give us the courage to come right up to the Jordan like the priest did and then you who is the way maker will make a way Lord I pray for those Lord that would walk into the Waters of baptism this morning I pray that God that you as you have met them Lord and and their hearts oh God has been surrendered and given to you I just pray father that you would bless them greatly Lord as they Lord would walk in these Waters Lord in obedience to your word may you meet them Lord I pray oh God lord even as the word is going forth Lord our hearts we just all together want to surrender and open to you Lord now Lord as we lift this special offering Lord God as you have just marvelously Lord just Lord provided and been providing and I pray that God that you would just just continue lord to bless your children Lord God their sacrifice Lord and the desire Lord that father the place that you've given us Lord it truly Lord is a miracle Lord and even in this Lord we want to say thank you Father we don't want to be Lord like the other nine lepers I want to be like that one Lord because father it's you that provides for us Lord yes Lord we thank you Lord may you bless your children Lord as they would give and then even Lord even through the oncoming weeks Lord we we just Lord know that God that you're more than enough we ask these things Lord in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen amen amen and by all means if you even in oncoming weeks I know that's been put on the envelopes where you've just wrote on there and um then some some do it through their bank and things like that and um if you need a PIN for your checkbook I can run back to my office and get one amen amen well let's look in the word of the Lord I appreciate the musician and amen I as we turn to Ruth chapter 3 I I text Brother Boaz there the other day and I took a few days to kind of when I had little bits of time to go through the message and my what a what a masterpiece yes it was I really really really enjoyed that that service um and I would say he referred he was quoting um a lot of references in greatest battle ever fought but also in the message you as he was drawing from that thought on the remedy uh he carth do you care my brother Bram preaches that twice he preaches it in 1960 and then in 1963 he preaches it and it's under the burden of what is it that will rub out any make belief or unbelief or anything that causes wondering and the Holy Spirit directs him right back to that of that of a real true repentance and that's something so it's a message I say it like this that's a message it would be good to go back over and to listen to he cares do you care because to tell you the truth I like how the prophet says it in the message he says he died to make a way that you might care that's so good we wouldn't even be able to care had he not made a way that we could care oh my I I just love the message of the hour Amen in Ruth 3:1 then Naomi her mother-in-law said unto her my daughter shall I not seek rest for thee that it may be well with thee I I'll just let you be seated right there and we'll keep on reading because I've had you stand in a little bit shall I not seek rest for thee that it may be well with thee notice the purpose in verse two and now is not Boaz of our Kindred with whose maidens thou was behold he win with barley tonight in the threshing floor I want you to catch this now I pray the Holy Spirit would just help us as we look in upon these things the prophet even when he would start into the message Kinsmen Redeemer he would he would ask the Lord and speak to the people he says if we can just really catch and the Holy Spirit would really reveal to us what has taken place and what God has done for us and even in this hour that we're living in and he said oh what a glorious thing it is and I believe that with all my heart I I know what he's revealed thus far it's wonderful it's glorious and so Naomi knows exactly where where he's at that's important you got to know where he's at you got to know where he's at that in the season of his word verse three she says wash thyself therefore and anoint thee and put thy reignment upon thee and get thee down to the floor but make not thyself known unto the man until he shall have done eating and drinking and it shall be when he lith down that thou shalt Mark the place where he shall lie Thou shalt go in and uncover his feet and lay thee down and he will tell thee what Thou shalt do and she said unto her all that thou sayest unto me I will do verse six and she went down unto the floor and did according to all that her mother-in-law bade her I would like to just continue to take that thought where we started the other week on accepting the counsel of the Lord and we we can stand here this morning just like Peter could declare in First Peter that we have not followed cunningly devised fables these are not things that's been made up by by the heads of man God didn't need to send us a new Bible the message never came to replace the Bible but the message come to raise the Bible into the place that God ordained it to be that the word of God would be the absolute in our lives and so Naomi would be being a type of the Old Testament also the prophet would speak of it of how that uh being a type of the Holy Spirit had had sought out of what was needed for Ruth in order for her to find rest which would be Safety and Security and I want to say that to you that that's the objective when the Holy Spirit the word comes to our life it's to bring and seek out settledness for our life God is not in the business of causing confusion he's not in the business of unsettling uh Hearts he's in the business of bringing us to a place of settledness in his word because that's the only place that'll that's the only place that'll stand and that's a sure place where we can come to so here she is under Ruth is under the leading of the Holy Spirit and it the word of God is leading her right to the right place and the humility that that she has has walked with it it was a virtue remember she she had a a humility and a virtue that was already being known even from when she uh exited the land of of Moab with her mother-in-law and come back into the land and and and Boaz has been has been watching this all along as a matter of fact he he has seen it and witnessed it before he ever descended into the field and came to her he was identifying the character that what was what she was about and let me just say it like this God knew when he would send this word in the end time behold I send unto you uh Elijah the prophet before that great and terrible day of the Lord and and he spoke within that but remember that in itself there's three people in that verse there is Elijah the prophet there is also I God and there is also you and so there are three people that are involved in that verse and God knew that you and I would be here in this hour God knew when he descended in the field of his word in this hour when the coming of the holy spirit in his fullness to fulfill that word and to make that word live God knew that you would be here and God also knew that there would be a character in you and I that would rise and to meet that word and come under that word to be molded and shaped and be brought into a union and into Rapture God already knew that we are not living in things that are just a happen stance but everything has been foreordained and pre-arranged by almighty God you did not stumble into this field by chance you did not stumble into this revealed word of the hour but it is the holy spirit that has sought you out and guided you to this moment this is why the questions you had even in the churches you set or maybe you never even darkened the door of a church and there was something within you that was longing for reality that you could not put your finger on it and let me tell you what that was that was a part of God that was in your life and the Holy Spirit in the Fulfillment of his word in this hour begins to make that Creation in you to stir that up to draw you to himself I want you to notice this in the book of Exodus 33:12 and here Moses says unto the Lord thou sayest unto me bring up this people and thou Hast not let me know whom thou will send me yet thou has said I Know Thee by name and thou has thou has also found Grace in my sight now therefore I pray thee if I have found Grace in thy sight show me now thy way that I may Know Thee that I may find Grace in thy sight and consider that this nation is thy people and he said my presence this is his person shall go with thee and I will give thee rest and he said unto them unto Moses said unto him If thy presence go not with me carry us up not hence I I don't want to go anywhere where you're not leading me I want to go where you're leading me you see I want to walk in your presence Lord amen and I think that's the part that every one of us come to is that to realize that we are here in a fallen condition a fallen world because one person let down on the word and chose their own way now that way was made to seem right it was made to feel right it was made to where that any judgment regarding that decision to go the wrong way was diminished but yet now that decision has come had come about and you and I were born in sin shaped in iniquity come to this world speaking lies we were all built within this place and within that first birth and that's something that even after the New Birth has come we have to continue to wrestle with and put in subjection because there's Parts about us that we still want our own way and sometimes we can even classify our way as though it's thus sayith the Lord but yet thus sayith the Lord will always collaborate and Unite with not only the written word but it'll always Unite with the character so if you can't find the scripture but you find out that's not matching up with the character of Christ lay it aside because he is the word we always want his way because there's two ways his way and our way his way is always right our way is always wrong is that right the Bible said there's a way that seeth right unto man but the end thereof are the ways of death and so when we look at this the prophet would talk about how that there is a buzzer that in our life like a you know a buzzer and he would say now when that little buzzer he said if it begins to ring as the word is going forth you better listen to that and don't walk across it cuz you'll never get any farther till you come right back to where you left him now he says where you leave Christ at by failing to obey his word notice he don't leave you you leave him and you always leave him because you get in in the power because he's got you in the path and he's trying to lead you but when you leave him then you have to come right back to where you left him at and start again so it's to trace back the steps if if any has got off on any path we just cannot come right back to go but we have to trace back the path to coming back to him is that right I know sometimes that what we don't want is we we don't want to uh take in the Harvest of wrongful actions but coming back through repentance it's not going to do away with sometimes the bitterness of the Harvest of wrong seeds that were sown by our own decision that that's not what forgiveness don't take away from that but you know the thing that we have to understand that when real forgiveness is when we can look to God then God will give us the grace to stand and come back to where we need to be and get back on track you every one of us have been in a place or with somebody that was going to take some good scenic route somewhere and finally after all chasing things around you finally realize we need to get back on the route right and you know sometimes you know there's places where you go there's no signals whatsoever uh I mean you count on GPS and what and there's just no signals to get back there so we all we sometimes we got to retrace our steps on how do I get back to where I left God remember brother BR says as a person he said remember that man when the ship was going down and he was passing on and dying and that little boy knew and read Isaiah 53 to him and he instructed him and said now go back to where you left him and he said that that that man thought for a moment and he realized this is where he left him now I lay me down to sleep oh where he left him you see God will not leave us to wonder but he'll direct us right back to where we left him but you know there's nobody listen friends nobody within our own when you've got a real desire to serve God nobody Desires in a way to leave him but we've got to feed that desire we've got to feed that desire and and not allow the other things of the world to come into our life that can lead us astray we do not not want things that lift up reasoning lift up imagination we want the word of God which will only exalt the word and exalt that work that he's done on the inside that's what we want to see exalted in our lives this says why the Prophet this is a powerful statement he says it's not up to him that willth or runneth it's God that showeth Mercy he said you know it isn't how much you try it's how much God has done for you and if you've got enough God to come out here tonight I'll say this morning a desire to come hear the message you ought to be the happiest person in the city because God is moving in your life and he's trying to lead you to the Fountain because he loves you oh aren't you thankful to have a desire amen the scripture says in Isaiah 556 seek ye the Lord while he may be found and call ye upon him while he is near and let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the Lord and He will have mercy upon him and to our God for he will abundantly pardon for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways sayeth the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my my thoughts than your thoughts oh that's what I want I want his ways I don't want Samuel's ways cuz Samuel's ways is always wrong Hallelujah you going to put your name there too I don't want Samuel's thoughts my thoughts are always wrong the only thing that would even that that when we only time we ever accept a thought like that is if the word itself has blessed it amen is that right the word must bless it how does the word bless it that it's in line with the word cuz if it's not in line with the word I don't want it I might want it my flesh might be pulled to it but I don't want it because at the end thereof are the ways of death that's right there's effects for those things I don't want that I I want I want to forsake and return is that what you want God I want to forsake if I'm going if I'm off a little bit I want to forsake that I don't want to try to defend it put arguments to it reason against it and and lay everything out I I want to I want to forsake it Lord I want to forsake whatever it is as it's leading and I cannot feel the peace of God to put my foot there I do not want to continue to walk that way I want to forsake it and return because there is abundance of Pardon in the presence of God and I tell you what as we're walking in this way God promised and he has provided the angel of the Lord to lead us all the way to the body change he's promised that he would lead us guide us keep us in the way and bring us to the promise of in my father's house are many mansions clear to the body chains and I tell you what by following the counsel of the lord we will make Canaan as sure as anything God's provided way that he's laid out for us in this hour I tell you I'm thankful aren't you I'm glad that God he reveals the acceptable way in this hour this is the counsel of the Lord now I don't know about you but you know when when I get in and I'm looking at things there's things that stand out to me and I I don't believe anything's just in coincidence within the word of God even in its placement in judges there's two place in the Book of Judges you know it's the book right before the little book of Ruth and in that Book of Judges is a time where it says that you know every man did what was right in his own eyes two times and the Very closing verse of the Book of Judges ends in verse 25 of Judges 21 and it says in those days there was no king in Israel and every man did that which was right in his own eyes Israel had a lot of trouble in the days of Judges you see the days of Judges is a parallel to that of even the ages the church ages remember that the here the the church was in inaugurated there it's a type the beginning of it of even there on the time of Solomon it totally it perfectly correlates with what took place on the day of Pentecost why Solomon was a man of rest right even when you trace through everything that happened in the dedication of the Temple God bringing his life into the believer and then you see how then on down through those kings Ahab being a type of those of that middle ages of that tharan age and you know coming in actually the paman age then it enters that into the thyra age and and I I just it comes down to a place to where now in the judges it's always a Time the prophet called it of a cycle of Revival and death he said where God would send the word and my he said people would be blazing and on fire with that original fire but after a while it would begin to cool down and and he said what would now only become now Embers that would there he said people would begin to allow themselves to partake of worldly things and watch things that they should not watch and read things that they should not reach why they begin to get comfortable in a past experience but God's not going to judge you on a past experience it's where you are right now are you walking in the word and the counsel of the Lord right now remember if he would have judged Lot's wife she started out as an overcomer but she didn't follow on she kept on walking but it never got out of her heart and eventually a call from in Sodom came out and she turned around to look and see what it was and right there right there in there she stopped and became a pillar of salt oh my we don't want to turn around for anything church we want to walk in the counsil of the Lord and God's not left you and I to try to find this on our own way but he himself is the one who's here with us to lead us and guide us and bring us into a place of rest to bring us into that place of a new heavens and a new Earth to lead us to the baptism of the Holy Ghost to lead us into that place of a real Security in him I want to just think I want you to look at this for a moment maybe you never thought of this before but you know with this last verse in the Book of Judges how fitting that is to the age we're living in an age that when God was calling it to repent they spit it right back in his face and said we are rich and increase with goods and we don't have need of nothing now you know it's comfortable for us to put that all out there on those bad churches all those bad denominations but I want you to know that's an attitude right denomination is not a building it's an attitude denomination is not an organization it's a spirit it's a spirit that wants to get upon and exalt above the word of God to get between you and the word and that where you and I would begin to take our own ideas our own thoughts our own feelings and and but yet we what we want to do is we want to stand and take the word of God because that is the only thing that'll never pass away and it's step by step of the way oh God help me Lord what a Time Israel had come into the land under Joshua but here they wer in the judges they had no counsel but the truth is they forsook the counsel if you ever look at this in the Book of Judges I want you to notice how important it is when God sends a message that that message is what God has sent to bring the interpretation of this word well I know scholar son I'm not interested in scholar son Ando God prepares a prophet he is a chip off of the diamond it's a vitrola needle when it's put up on the canned record the record that has the music in it when it places upon there it releases what's been sealed in here that's why this me message God could not send you and I a reformer because it would not bring the faith that was needed to live an overcoming life in this hour it would not bring the faith that was needed for rapturing condition and it wasn't brother brandom in his own self that brought it he was a channel that was found in the scriptures that God had promised he would send a prophet and a prophet is an eye piece it is a mouthpiece whereby the prophet is not speaking speaking according to his own thoughts but a prophet is caught up into a realm and he catches what God has already spoken and he's notifying the church this is the season this is the hour this is the acceptable time of the Lord Lord in the Book of Joshua the word Moses is mentioned 51 times Moses said Moses the servant of God in the Book of Judges four times you want to know friends the pattern I don't understand where I don't understand if if individuals can say well we don't need to quote the prophet maybe you need to check and see whether you even believe the message and maybe you need to check to see it's even been revealed to you hallah come on cuz when Caleb went to get his Mountain he reminded Joshua Moses Moses said this is what this message promis me is a full Rapture a full inheritance he reminded Joshua this is what the word has said I tell you're talking about living a Victorious Life in this hour you're not going to live it outside of the message of the hour and when I'm talking about the message of the hour I'm not talking about books and tapes the message of the hour is Jesus Christ the person right here revealed before and in and through his body of Believers this is the son of man where the Eagles are being gathered to feed for body change feeding to overcome habits feeding to overcome fears and anxieties he's all I have need of [Music] [Applause] you quot him too much you might want to find another church I don't mean that arrogantly I'm just telling you I know where I'm standing the Bible said he that ha an ear let him hear what the spirit say to the church you want a blessing in your home stay with what the message has brought well I know so and so got off this way don't look at so and so the quotes not wrong their interpretation was wrong but the word is always right there a lot of quotes and all of a sudden you can go to quotee them and it's like you know all of a sudden people want to get scared I understand that but don't fault me because somebody that wasn't qualified to handle the word took that word and began to put a carnal interpretation to it and I'm going to tell you right now without him I'm nothing I'm depending on him he's the one who sent this message and the same angel that sent it is the same angel that accompanies this word to bring it to pass Hallelujah so yes sir I'm going to say what Moses said I'm going to say what the prophet of God has said the best thing that could happen for some of you to lay aside your bookstore devotionals and get into the message of the hour that's what keeps you going around the same Mountain you've been going around this mountain long enough it's time to get in to the message of the [Applause] [Music] Hour come on Friends well I heard doctor so and so said they don't have the word for the bride they don't have the word for [Applause] [Music] Rapture 51 times it was mentioned in the Book of Joshua only four times in the Book of Judges see to me friends when I'm when I when I'm this message when I hear this message it didn't draw me out of my Bible it drew me this Bible means more to me now than it ever did I mean it's got to where now you all may not do this but for me I mean my Bible I'm going to have to have this one rebound but you know you just hate to get rid of something that's already broke in and sometimes I have parts of quotes written in here and and everything it just things that you know God does it didn't take me away from the Bible this message come to reveal the god of the Bible well brother Samuel denominations they follow the Bible that's a lie they don't follow the Bible they'll go up to a certain point but they can't take all the word of God they'll hang up and they they'll teach that he split into three personalities that's heathenism that never came from the mind of God it's not three persons it's one God revealing himself as father as son as Holy Ghost brother we needed the counsel of God we needed the anointing of the holy spirit that was promised to be poured out upon the word in this hour Hallelujah and you know what that promise is when he would pour it out that anointing be poured out at the end going into the Philadelphian age which is the age before lady OA he said I set before thee an open door and brother Brown tells that open door it merges into the last St you know what that door is that door is the person of Jesus Christ for he said I am the shepherd John 10 I am the shepherd and I am the door of the sheep he's the one that leads us draws us guides us to him and then as we enter in through him oh we have safety in him and there is the power of God that moves down in our life to raise up a son and daughter of God why we've come through the open door the way that has been set before us Lord my my we could probably just close there and say it been good to be here but I'll tell you friends it's a truth yes that's why there's things that I think I'm just going to stay right now I think there's things you know what our our young people it a it ain't just depending on me well brother Samuel they needed to get at youth Bible study it shouldn't just depend on that there's Direction that the prophet has given us even on marriage on how we're to marriage how we're to seek things out and he was not speaking in some civil political manner either these are things that are to be instructed in our home I don't care what the culture says you be strong and courageous and stay with the word because if you'll stay with the message of the hour oh that was just brother bram's thought you better run from that I know there's a lot of voices in the land that said oh this is Brother bram's opinion my whole point that I will call them on the carpet with is show me the Vindication in your ministry that was there in the ministry of Malachi 4 and if we're going back to that that's what God C us out of every man doing what was right in his own eyes God does not want us to follow any man as an absolute oh I got to get to this pastor I got to get to this preacher there is one that we have been introduced to and if you ever meet him in a personal way you come to know his ways you come to know his voice and it stabilizes you because he said I'll take care of you when you get in trouble I'll save you when the things get hard I'll deliver you [Applause] Hallelujah you want a home that's blessed with God take the message of the hour now it's because the scripture said as many as I love in Revelations 3 not not as many as love me brother BR said we never to make him the object of human love he said the many are the elected of God as many as I love well what do you do do you send them Amazon drop things do you send them sugar what do you do I rebuke and chasen be zelous therefore and repent now I don't care friends who who you are who we are our flesh don't like correction that's right that's right I said our flesh that's why there's got to be something deep in our life a strength on the inside that's able to hear God's voice and say look I might have a right to feel this way but you are not going to reside in my life and dominate my life I'm not nope grudges are not welcome get out it's not welcome I don't want that because you know why that'll be left here you see friends when when the Rapture comes we're not all of a sudden when the come will it be perfect love over there but remember it'll take perfect love here to get there so it isn't when Rapture comes along and man the atoms of our bodies are changed automatically hey that Grudge I had against you gone no no that's the power of the rapturing word in this hour to dismantle things in our life that would be holding us down once to hold us back right amen Lord Jesus help us he said said behold I stand at the door and knock I'm trying to get somewhere behold I stand at the door and knock that's our heart that's not the church remember he got put out of the church right the Lord Jesus got put out of the church see they've got the Bible but they put out the Holy Ghost they put out the word for man's ideas well all you got to do is just you know just believe on Jesus and and that's all there is to it but wait a minute he spoke about you and I taking up not his cross he did that for you and I but you and I have a cross to take up you see it's like an easy an easy no commitment just just just this and that's it you know you can go on and live your own life and everything's okay and and it's all right but you see listen friends that will never I want you to understand me God God is a Shepherd not a herdsman right that's right God's not trying to her people in he leads you and I he draws you and I he doesn't want to come and make us fearful and terrifi well if I don't serve God I may go to hell what kind of miserable that that's miserable that's that's where that's where that God is moving to bring Ruth to a place of rest to where she knows that no matter what takes place I am my beloveds and he is mine to where that she no longer is just looking at her own identity but now God is bringing her to a place to where she is is taking on the identity of Boaz now she's got to know Boaz over many days this Harvest barley Harvest then wheat Harvest over many days I don't know weeks I don't know but it was a period of time and she got to know his character right you see she's got to have trust she's come around his character She's Come Around the word and and if Ruth got to a spot and said uhuh you're not going to medal in my life right there we are not doing that you're not going to tell me how to live you're not going to tell me what to do but what do you like about me Ruth well I love Grace but that's only one attribute that's the attribute that brings the realization of all these other things because you cannot even live what I've called you to live without the grace of God and so he himself will not even allow the attribute of Grace to be misinterpreted so that our lives are not in disgrace but that we become the real trophies of divine grace he is The Interpreter of his own word is he not and I want you to think of this of how that Ruth oh she is falling in love with the character of Boaz she's already been told when she comes in hey hey hey the field that man you talked about Boaz he's a near Kinsman Naomi is already rejoicing cuz the prophets have looked forward to this time Naomi beginning to rejoice and H you know who this is hallelujah now I want to just say it you know in this way that when you begin to look at it you know how that God would come in such a way that you know for for the Lord coming like it was in Revelation 3 in this end time where even as we said in the Book of Judges every man did what was right in his own eyes you know that God when he sent the message in this hour he could not build upon the ideas and the Creeds of man in other words it was not as though it was a building that was already built in a place just awaiting the headstone are you hearing me now there had been an elect that had come under the word of God in their generation but when the word would come in this hour to to a people of God there had to be an establishing of the church back on the rightful foundation of the Lord Jesus Christ the Chief Cornerstone the foundation is that right this is why the Bible said zerubabel his hands have laid the foundation and he shall also bring forth the Capstone so God in this age brought a word that would take us back to the original Foundation brother he won just 2,000 years ago it took us back to the back parts of God's mind and showed us the lamb we were there as sons of God shouting for joy and you know when we're shouting for Joy the prophet says in one place we saw our Salvation in another place he said the sons of God were shouting for Joy when they would recognize one day the life of this lamb would be tabernacled in Dwelling Places again do you understand what hearing from your theophany is it's tying you back to that reality of who you always were and what you rejoiced and shouted about in the mind of God it brought you back to the Cornerstone to the foundation and as a matter of fact you're part of this Foundation the prophet said and chosen place of worship he laid the foundation stone in you before the foundation of the world this is why we don't build upon our own ideas we don't build upon anything outside of the revelation of Jesus Christ and it takes the quickening power of God to raise up the foundation stone of the seed of God that he placed within us so you know what he's doing it'll be word added to word so inside of our life there is a conforming to the very image of Jesus Christ and it's all under the counsel of the lord it's all him leading us continuing to draw you and I lead us through the word word lead us by his Spirit oh my aren't you thankful friends for the message in this hour it's God bringing us into real Dwelling Places you see the thing of it is and I want you just to listen to me for a moment you see Ruth was Ruth was tested Boaz didn't put her in a bubble she was going to be tested right whether she'd follow the young men cuz they were much closer to her age than Boaz was I won't get into that today they were much closer but you see when we get to looking at this this is where that God would stand in this Lal seean age and here you find oh man I mean when the baptism of the Holy Ghost struck down you know there on isua street and return of gifts and my the supernatural that was taken but there was a lot of mixture of wrong as well this is why that the bride is not called back to and Aza Street Experience but the bride is brought back to the original Pentecost experience come on friends I hope you don't misunderstand me Pentecost is not signs and wonders and miracles Pentecost this a direct quote out of spoken words Original Seed Pentecost is God they met God and then signs and wonders followed them that believed this is why you and I listen friends we don't follow after the supernatural if the supernatural has come to us and the Supernatural is following Our Lives you may not even realize but the way that you have even stood on your job or maybe with your family where the enemy has tried to draw you out and the spirit of God would move you in a way you may not have even failed it but God Gave You Grace to stand there and conduct yourself as a son and daughter of God anybody else would have blown to a middle of pieces and you walk away and what is that signs and wonders are following them that believe a supernatural God that is holding you as a prisoner to his word you talking about a [Applause] miracle Brother s I want to see something Supernatural you can be healed and get sick again but when God takes a hold of your life and changes it and as your character is being molded more and more in His image that is irreversible [Applause] Hallelujah GL now you all know I appreciate healing I I'm not preaching healing is a minor thing hey when I get sick it's major that's not I'm not saying that but what I'm trying to say here this morning is that the bride of Christ is not being drawn back into a place of we've got to have this we've got to have that and we've got to have this amen and and pictures painted well I'm not going to go there this morning but sometimes it's it's responsibility I I think of myself as a minister of the Gospel of this message I've got a responsibility of what I set before you I don't want to just set a mirage of something you're grabbing at and grabbing at but to recognize the Dynamics is not something out there and the Dynamics is right there working in your life how do you think you're sitting here this morning in your right mind even when things have gone backwards from what you wanted it to go you prayed and it went the other way you prayed and you never heard an answer I'm asking you what's holding you the Dynamics of the holy spirit it's come to make the word live in flesh HL so we're not going to minimize it to just well it's something got to take place up here it's something no no no the Dynamics is Christ coming to his word and making that word live and the prophet said it like this in the adoption series it's Christ Living in a farmer it's Christ Living in a housewife it's Christ Living in a minister it's Christ Living in a factory worker it's Christ Living in a father it's Christ Living in a mother what adopted Sons and Daughters of God by the dynamic power of the Holy Ghost na me said I know where he's at I'm going to tell you where he's going to be at he's going to be right in his word right down there this is Harvest Time this is Harvest time I know where he's gonna be he's GNA be down in the Harvest floor where they will winow they will throw up and separate the seed from the shuck cuz it's Rapture time the seed shall not be air with the Shu aren't you glad that he separates you from you you and I sometimes can come here we can get all confused and down on ourselves and we'll look at our failures and look at our mistakes all of our shortcomings and here he is that's standing in the Floor of harvest time and he begins to take that word and run it through our lives and the things that was weighing us down the great Winds of the Holy Ghost just blow that shaft away and all that's left is the seed of who you really were always were no matter what you felt like no matter what came this week he is the one who separates [Music] amen this is why they knew where to find him you go down there he going to be there tonight I know where he's going to be remember Naomi the Old Testament right was a foreshadow of the new I tell you where he's going to be I'm not guessing no wonder if God's going to send another Revival in America no no I'm not guessing I know where he's at and I can tell you if you go down there the way I'm telling you to approach it Hallelujah I I want to run so much with you GL Hallelujah but you see we're not the Bible said when they came to the tomb why seek you the living among the dead right you know the Rich Young Ruler no wonder the prophet would take the Rich Young Ruler and and type him as the lady oan AG that's because here's one I've done all the Commandments but he knew he' lack something in his life and that's why he was standing there before the Lord Jesus the prophet would speak to it and say as he held on to his great possessions now let me just tell you friends you might be as poor as a job job's turkey but we ain't talking about gold and silver here right we ain't talking about nickels and dimes we're talking about whatever is held to that you value above the word of God that's a great possession to you but let me just tell let let me just say this to you listen to me now don't don't don't don't don't pull back on me let me just say this to you when the Holy Spirit begins to touch things and he's dealing with things in your life and it feels like woo it's come I'm going to tell you what that is that's a spirit that's right right then and there you need to enter right in to the word because the power of the holy spirit is here to break Spirits let me say this to you you could try to live you could try to live right try to do everything I'll try to dress right I'll try not to put makeup on I'll try to do this you listen and I think I think that would that's a wonderful thing I remember when God got a hold of my life and man I'll tell you what you know you didn't have apple um music then good thing for me because I I lik all kinds of music and I was always God have music playing that didn't change I I still I love music I'll have music going if I don't have a message going I have music going I'll be singing but I had a whole big case man of CDs then I had you know from where I had my earrings and I had those in the box and had that laid out you know I missed a cool one when God got a hold of my life I still had a pull on them things but there was I remember somebody said what what you going to do with them I said I don't want them no more amen yeah there you go I'm just telling you I don't want them no more and you know let me just tell you something there's a power it comes to agreeing with the word of God you understand what you saying Brother Sam I'm saying that music that worldly music was not me them hoops and everything that wasn't me it was a spirit you've got to realize it's not something well I've got to try to do this better there is a God who supplies all of our needs he breing breaks Spirits he breaks habits he's a chain breaker the breaker is come up he breaks holdes he breaks depression he breaks anxiety listen friends it's not you it's a spirit that wants to hold you back it's a spirit of fashion and the Holy Spirit says you can't rule over my daughter no more you can't roll over my son no more there is a desire in their heart to be free and they're laying it aside and what does he do he breaks that hold on your life I'm telling you not not to the end of service I'm telling you right now well the word's going forth what are you saying he's letting you know where he's laying at he's laying in the [Applause] floor if you'll let him he'll separate you from them worldly desires [Applause] I don't care what it cost me let me just say this to your friends it still cost me it still cost me when the Holy Spirit deals with my heart and there's things that comes up that God brings me to that I couldn't bring myself to and I'm brought to a place to stand face to face and say there's still too much Samuel here it still takes the counsel of the Lord it still takes that this isn't just some One-Shot deal right here at the altar man we're good to go the rest of the time we are born as children of God but we grow to manhood that's why even when God gets a hold of her life there might be little things that they'll have to set aside it might want to come back they'll push it away it'll want to come back but as they feed on the word and the experience in their life they'll find that hold is broken in their life why greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world it's not your Perfection it's his [Applause] [Music] Perfection this message come to show you and I I know where he's at I know where you can find rest I know where we can get all this settled and Ruth said I'm all ears and I'm all heart that's a time you want ears you want a great big heart too see that Rich Young Ruler down in his heart brother BR said he knew there was something different about Jesus than the rest of them Pharisees I want you to think about that no doubt I know I talked with some of you even when God brought you back here after a time and you said and talked to me and said we've been here and we've been there but there's something different about here well let me tell you it ain't this physical address I'm glad God's no respect to person I listen I I I love where we're at I thank God for the building and everything we're at and man everything we've had to go through and you know some through the water some through the floods I'm grateful we've had to you know move through all those things but let me just tell you something it is not the beauty of this place right here but it's the beauty of his character that's being revealed to his people in his people and through his people you know what it is that there is a reality of God that is here that in your life and in my life that beyond your circumstances there's a word that tells you you are not hopeless you are not Beyond Redemption your problem is not too great there is nothing too big for God there is a place right here that says he is more than able and if God is for us tell me who can be against us tell me what habit tell me what situation tell me what [Applause] Spirit hallelujah oh God we got to follow that pathway back into the holiest of holies let me just let me just try to bring this around here I tell you friends if not for God's mercy you and I would not have found the path that's right that's right David said he'll make known unto me the path of life he will show me that's what the Bible says show me reveal to me we wouldn't even even know how do I get to him are you listening to me now the Bible says in the book of Deuteronomy CH 12 there's many gates that the lord giveth thee but there's one gate right that he's given to place his name in right the prophet said all them other Gates was given to tempt but the gate that he places his name in is his life is his character is his nature is who he really is is is that right brother Bram would say it in this way in the message indictment he said there's reasons why we don't see things happening in the churches now he's not altogether talking about signs and wonders that's that he's talking about with a life that's lived a life that is harnessed to the word of God a life where there's a desire to please God above everything else a desire that doesn't pull back and say well my pastor said says this or my so- and so says this you know listen friend that's the same thing are you listening now that's the same thing as a person you or I that could follow the word of the hour and then we get in a real tight spot and we'll say but my daddy said but my mama said my grandma said my so and so said it's got quiet now but the Bible said forsake all others and cleave thee only unto him that's what's important that's many times listen I I've stood as a pastor now 22 years this weekend 22 years does seem like just about just few years to me in one way in another way I look at pictures and I think I didn't get them wrinkles overnight I didn't get I didn't get that didn't happen just like but I look at it now and one thing I've always found and these are things that matter after you sit and talk with someone give them Direction and counsel and you realize when you pray I go away pray God be merciful Lord help them and just continue to pray Lord help them give them Grace because I know that those things can wrestle and more there could be things we want but what we want more than anything else is the word of God because sometimes there's things that we might want you got to look to the end of it where's this going to lead me to if I make this decision now where's it going to lead me to see lot didn't see that lot only looked at hey it's better down there so you got to be careful what you follow you could follow a job right out of church you could follow activities right out of church come on you could follow a lot of things right out of church let me I'll just say you right now you don't need to pray over anything that's leading you out of church that's right the only reason we pray and say I wonder if this is God's will it's not really that we want to know it's God's will it's what we want but let me tell you when you put God first God is a way maker he's a way maker he does the miraculous when you stand upon his word listen miracles do not precede the word Miracles follow the word amen go fill the water pots with water then the miracle happen repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and the Miracle will come roll away the stone and the Miracle will walk out yes Miracles follow obedience to the word brother Bram said they reject the very path to get back to the blood which is the word and he says there's only one way God will honor that word you'll never honor that word and come out and say I'm a Roman Catholic I demand this to be done you can't do it Methodist Baptist or Pentecostals you can't do it the only way you can do it is under the mercies of God through his grace is to come through the shed blood of Jesus Christ and say Lord I claim the promise in the message the way back in 1962 he says if you say you believe God and deny his word well then you don't believe God cuz God is his word you can't do it you've got to accept the word that is the way back back by the word path and the word is God Amen and the message leadership I hope this all right this is Moses maybe quote 48 out of the message leadership brother BR says there's no church listen to me now there's no church no methodists Baptists Pentecostals or anything else can ever put this church into the bride that's right it'll have to be the answering of Malachi 4 for God to send a prophet to be revealed cuz that's the only way remember David wanted to bring the ark back right he wanted to bring it back and what he did he consulted with captains of thousands many many schools of men's thoughts and you know what they said Put it on a new cart God never intended mechanical devices to carry the word that's a direct quote God never intended that you know what that end up causing it end up PA and when the ark started to slide off of that it shows that it's not in its rightful place cuz the word started to shift listen that's why the word it's got to be deeper than just your mind it's got to be deeper than just your spirits it's got to be something to where the love of God has come into your soul by the Holy Ghost it changes your desire and your desire is to please God if there's anything that's going to move it's not the word it's my will not thy will not not my will but thine will be done if there's anything going to slide off it's my way because I want to go God's way that's when the word comes back into the rightful position God said it's to be carried over the heart of the priest the prophet said that's the rightful place for the word is in your heart amen right cuz if it's in our mind it only takes C certain website it'll will be gone it's only and that's what I'm talking about in our spirit oh it takes oh this this you know that's all it takes but when it's anchored even though you may not even have the explanation to it or whatever more but you say too late as a matter of fact I I don't even eat out of garbage cans I found something so much better I don't need to I don't even need to know what the garbage men are picking up God hadn't sent me to straighten out them that want to eat out of trash cans God sent me with a message where there's children that they're sick and tired of eating out of trash they're sick and tired of living an up and down life and God has sent a word in this hour to say hey you don't have to fly around on dead carcasses things that lead to death and destruction and causes you a ticket to the tribulation but if you're Desiring to go in the Rapture and live an overcoming life there is a fresh kill of the word right here in the threshing floor [Applause] now amen my my my don't you love the Lord hallelujah you know the Bible says it like this in Romans 2:4 the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance that's very key friends right repentance I know is that's that's where we begin but but this is the thing God's not interested in us staying in a cycle of where it's just a cycle of repentance but yet you and I have to repent daily right but this repentance I'm talking about is there's got to be a starting spot and see it's the goodness of God what what goodness what does this mean the goodness of God it's the same one I read to you out of the book of Exodus where it says my presence shall go before thee and God by his presence leads us and has led us to repentance isn't it powerful that even in a service like this that there's things that God can bring to your attention and to my attention and it's the goodness of God the revealing of the mercies of God that will direct us into Parts in our life and lead us to repentance come on Friends well brother Samuel I'm a sheep I'm a lamb that new nature is that that on the inside that's been raised up yeah but remember there's this here right now even when Nathan came to David he never came into David and walked in there and said hey you're a guilty guy buddy flat service might as well saying take the name of Jesus with you and go on why because even though it's truth it ain't going to help but you see what God does the goodness of God begins to stir David's gates up knowing David's a word man is that right but God knows I can't allow them gates in the spirit to get in the way because if he locks up even though he's a word man on the inside I cannot allow them Gates to lock up the gates have got to be open right for me to enter so how does God bring the gates open in David's life how does he bring the gates open in our life by his word by his presence it causes us to trust him and then the gates are open and then he just slips right in there as the mighty conqueror and as he slips right in and then he leads us to repentance I wish there's more time I had to deal with this on that of repentance because it's such a key in this hour it you know you know you're a blessed you're a blessed person you and I are blessed friends to be able to hear God's voice to be able to realize that what this word has called you and I too look I no doubt like right in here I'm talking to people that were Roman Catholics maybe some of you were devout and probably a lot of you weren't and then you're talking you know the people might have been Baptist devout Baptist I mean you had all the gold stars on the on the Sunday School calendar and all these other things you know but still it took the word of God coming across your path and Jesus said I've not come to call the righteous to repentance I'm come to call the Sinners to repentance you see isn't it wonderful that there's a call that goes forth into your heart and to your life that call was broadcast you understand that it was broadcast throughout this whole generation and those who are affected by that word and are coming into a real repentance with God pise God no man the Bible said can come unto me except my father draw him and I'll raise him up in the last days you see what that drawing is you you and I could not even seek after him unless he first begin to draw us and let me just tell you this right here the drawing did not even start no doubt when you were sitting in the church the drawing could have started like even when you reading a track remember the one man word made flesh from India trip his wife had a track somebody gave him a track and all of a sudden one day he just sitting around and just pulls it out of his pocket and all of a sudden he began to read that track and he said the awfulest feeling came over me that I needed to get right brother Ram said right there is where you was saved Hallelujah yes sir he said brother Ram right there he said yeah he said you never were able to get away from were he said no he says and you used to do horse betting and gambling and drinking and all those things like it used to used to dance halls used to love all he said I used to he said he said from that moment he said I didn't I didn't like it no more he said I don't want he said what happened brother BR said it was God's thought that came in and dropped down into that man's life right there my goodness it happened all at once right there with him but to think of even the prophet listen now is everybody okay amen yes this is so struck me in that message Redeemer and Redemption a lot of those messages I've just continued to listen to Listen to and brother BR said this message Redeemer and Redemption he said when God began to deal with my heart and I knew that I was a sinner he said you know what the sad part about it was I couldn't find a church that even would make an altar call he said I didn't even know how to get right with God he said I didn't know how he said with what was being dealt with in my heart he said all they talked about was the bridge being built across the river and they talked about this he said but one day he said it finally came to a place he said by Church wouldn't make an altar call the place I went he said I wrote a letter he said I don't know even how to approach you but he said God if you're real Hallelujah Lord make yourself known to me he knew it was real but he sought him out you see what it was it was the goodness of God that led him to repentance friends I understand we want to grow we should continue to grow in the word what a responsibility we want to go on to Perfection but let us never ever get away from a moment when there is a heart being touched by the voice of God that they're being drawn down to a place of repentance where you and I have already come to to meet him at the foot of the cross May there always be that place where he is lifted up where everyone that might be guilty might be under situations where they don't know that their sins have already been forgiven them that they don't know that there's one who's already paid away made away and paid the price shed his blood where they don't know that but where he comes in and makes himself known to them that I am your sin Bearer I am the pardoning power of divine grace for your life amen where am I going to find him at Naomi you'll find him in the threshing floor amen that's where you'll find him but Ruth when you go down there to that floor this is how I want you to go you must go this right way you need to wash yourself first what do you mean now me well you know the word that you've been setting under let it wash you yeah come on now it's preparing you to meet him who is the word cuz you see you and I would not be able to have what's needed to prepare ourselves to meet what he's required so he's provided Esther all that we have need of and then I want you to get your garment I want you to get the best garment you've got and I want you to cover yourself Hallelujah I want you to remember I can't go into this here today but her approach to that floor was not to be seductive this was a divine approach because she's already been in a courtship as it were getting to know the character of Boaz yes so she's coming to a place she says I want to know how look look what's drawing out of her life at that time how do I submit myself how do how do I go and ask for the right for him Hallelujah to be My Kinsman because that's who he is but how do I do that wash yourself and cover yourself up and present yourself right at his feet don't just lay anywhere get to his feet and when you get to his feet remember she said Mark the place where he's laying I'm out of time I'm way out of time Mark the place where he's laying and go and lay down at his feet L you know what that means don't go lay down right there at his midsection by his rib but go lay down at his feet you know what that signifies this word this character that I've been in the presence of that's been speaking to my life there's been a confidence that's been built she's watched how Boaz has cared for her right she's every day those handfuls of purpose she's caught the refreshment when she's been parched she has had his hand extended with barley cakes she has caught his kindness and it has built confidence in him of what he sees in her and it's led her to a place to say I want the word to be the headship Hallelujah of my life I'm willing to lay my life down yes that he might be my ruler my head my leader Amen to lead me into all righteousness to lead me through all the trials and test of life I I'm not even focused on that but I know he'll be right there with me I've Got Confidence and that's what that was she had confidence to come and lay herself down and Mark the place where he's laying I wonder even here tonight you know this morning for us maybe there's one in here you haven't marked the place but you know when you mark the place in your heart where he laid down a Calvary where he's he's laid down there's been a death to self a dying out to self that he's all I want he's all I want he's all that I need and you know that dying out it just is not one time the Bible said take up our cross daily sir daily it's daily at his feet when Lazarus was raised from the grave look over a chapter or two the next time that you find Lazarus mentioned he's at the feet of Jesus at his feet that's where we want to stay I want to stay at his feet Lord I want this word I want this word to be the headship of my life I want I want this to be the amen of my life that's the promise the Bible said in the book of Isaiah I believe Isaiah 65 it says they they that will inhabit that City are they who bless themselves in the god of Truth and that phrase means the god of the amen those who will walk in the Amen in the headship of God you love him oh my let's bow our heads father Lord I know this is Lord the desire from my heart and I believe Lord God throughout this assembly this is our

God the same one one that Lord has come to him to bring him into the path they begin Lord to return to remember in their mind from when they had fallen and begin to think of that Lord then your presence begins to come and there will be a return and then may they go on to Perfection Lord maybe they've got Lord the the pathway the cares of Life have Lord God have got them so weighed down but

surrender Lord as you spoke here earlier that habits and things that are actually Spirits things that want to hold your children back lord things that maybe has hindered and wanted to come between them and the word but Lord I'm standing here Lord under your anointing by the word of God under the blood of the lamb and Lord God when there's a desire that's calling out on the inside I I know there is Lord or else you would not have Lord have that to be said within that way and to lead me down that pathway and then it be brought back back to my heart right now so Lord there's a desire within the heart of your children that's Longing To Be Free Lord Lord we can't find our way out but Lord God there's a desire on the inside Lord that's calling out for the master to come across the sea to come to our need because Lord when Peter was sinking Lord he made the greatest declaration he could ever say he said Lord save me lest I perish God there's hands up this morning Lord there's hearts Lord

leadership thank you for this Pillar of Fire Lord L thank you Lord the angel of the Lord being right here Among Us Lord to lead us to keep us in the away Lord we need you this message has not made us smarter it brings the realization we're sheep we need our Shepherd oh God I think of how your Prophet said [Music] Lord he said let me so live in that word till my word and his word becomes the selfsame [Music] thing so live by the word till we become the word Lord God there's pressures I know there's pressures all around us there's pressures that want to pull us into that realm of reasoning like we've been looking at Lord in our midweek services in imagination but God help us Lord we want to walk by the counsel of the Lord You've not left us in this hour to wonder to try to figure our way out but God you sent us a message Vindicated with your presence Lord here you are among us living in US Lord I wonder here this morning I know we've had I know we've a little bit of time but I wonder here this morning think back on what you can lift your heads up think back on what was said even in this morning because it really I think it overlaid a lot of it the way the Lord took it you know the greatest way we can honor this message we could have pictures and I thank God for the pictures don't you picture of the pillar of fire yeah because as the Prophet said he had his picture taken with us that's yes [Music] sir but I think every one of us right here this morning I don't think there's anybody that would say I don't want more of God I think every one of our hearts would say I want more of God I I I want I want him to be the influencer of my life cuz we're living in an age right where everybody they've got people who actually make a living as young people called influencers yeah right there you go if they wear you know if they shave off this eyebrow and then there's other people going to shave it off it's really nothing new it's been going on yeah somebody wears a green shoe red shoe then somebody else and now it's just spread throughout the world it don't matter if you live in 10 Buck two or you live in City it it the worldwide web that's right people get stuck in influencers yes right but think about this I don't want my opinions that's why I said when someone says oh that's brother Ram's opinion I'll take his opinion any day over your opinion when you tell me that you've just told me I don't need to hear you no more soon as you say that because to me I'm talking about a man whom God stood next to and there are things that God would allow him to see that though I may not understand but I will heed to the counsel that was given because I know it's [Music] safety [Music] right oh my there's a lot right now but I'm just I want to just say it in this way I want him to be the complete influence of my home but Sam what are you saying Joshua Moses was mentioned 51 times in the Book of Judges four times I want this message to Prevail in my life and in my home I believe it is but with that right there God bringing us to that realization friends in the dark hour that we're living in if we ever needed the light of God to shine upon our life it's right now and let me just tell you something it ain't light out there but it's light in Goan yes there's light right in our dwellings yes amen and to me I feel safe standing on this message I'm I'm not trying to hold you I just want you to see this there was a man I just had stood and I had ministered years ago some years ago I stood and I ministered the opening meeting in his convention when I got in the back office the things that was said to me in the back office I thought Lord have mercy what what what did I do come to find out that Pastor was on his way out of the message wow very incredible the things that was said but when I got home from those meetings I got a call early in the morning and I thought 8:00 a.m. and it called me and begin to talk to me about all of the problems and everything going on within his church the very first thing that I could look at and say is is you've cost him when you start questioning the message yeah there you go you see this is why when someone says and they want to take this position behind the pull pit and said that's brother bram's opinion you know what it's trying to do replace the absolute with themselves that's right I'm going back there I have come out of Egypt I'm not going back not going back not going back that's why I can tell you right now if I hear those things and someone has preached things like that you won't stand behind this pull pit because I don't want to hear your opinions it wasn't no man's opinions that changed my life it was the word of God spoken through the prophet of God [Music] and as I got off the phone there's things that you know just like if you called me for for advice or we set back there I don't pull things out of thin air no but neither do I know where to go unless he'll guide me brother Aaron as I was sitting there talking and and it was it come to such a place to where I realized at that time I can't even refer to him to a quote and then from a quote I'll take you right into the scripture I don't just have to have quotes I can show you right through the scriptures but I I realized and I began to talk to him about certain things and as soon as I hung up the phone the spirit of God came right there in the office and said the authority of the word has been lifted from this assembly talking about that church wow wow and it wasn't but but a month and two weeks later where the full letter came out and the departure I'll tell you what you know what the end result of it is his own family don't even follow him right that's right has [Music] nothing you say what are you saying Brother Sam I'm saying if we want life we want blessing listen there's things that I couldn't change my children you can't change you couldn't change your children you and I can't do that but if you invite the message of the hour into your life in your home and when I'm talking about that I'm talking about Jesus Christ invite it in get into the message of the hour am my every service I know is unique and I'm not trying to hold on to your time but I'm telling you I feel like in this moment in this hour if there's one thing of life I do not want to follow my own way that's [Music] right we're in the Ephesians the Book of Joshua is the book of Ephesians you know what that is this is my position why Moses said so Moses is God's spokesman right from the word of God it said this is mine well how does Moses know it Joshua tell me how does he know it well I'll tell you why the same inspiration that came and dealt with his life and revealed who he was is the same inspiration that I'm telling you this is what your inheritance is well I don't know if I can take that I don't know if this can be no the same inspiration that was with from the foundation of the world that breathed into your life is the same inspiration that I'm caught under to bring a word to let you know this is who you are am oh friends don't you just want to stand I don't want to be I don't want to be ashamed of him and his words he said they that'll be ashamed of me in my words in this generation he said I'll be ashamed of you I'm not ashamed of this message I'm not ashamed of it I'm not ashamed not just to stand and preach it here I'm not ashamed to live it because let me tell you something as a sister as a brother you may not be able to string all the quotes together but you've got the life of this message of that resurrection power that barley bread that honey bread inside of your life and you live out a life that Thunders against hell it thunders out Holiness it thunders out Purity amen and your life preaches a message everywhere you go the shout that has come has taken a hold in your life and there's a shout going out of your life Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever want you to love him I tell you it's sweeping us home I tell you this message is sweeping us home it's catching you and I away from our doubts it's catching us away from
