in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen god bless you tonight as if you're turning if you'll turn the bible maybe to romans 15 we want to just begin there tonight a man just so thankful for the mercy of God tonight amen so enjoyed the communion service that we we had there and enjoyed all the services on Sunday and just such a communion such a wonderful precious time that the Lord Amen would afford to us and we're just so thankful for the Fellowship of the Holy Spirit amen thankful for the fellowship a man of one another this great body of Jesus Christ verse 13 and we'd like to begin just a few verses of Scripture now the god of Hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing that you may abound in Hope through the power of the Holy Ghost and I myself also am persuaded of you my brethren that ye also are full of goodness filled with all knowledge able also to admonish one another nevertheless brethren I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort as putting you in mind because of the grace that is given to me of God that I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles ministering the gospel of God that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable being sanctified by the Holy Ghost amen may God bless you and bless His Word as you're being seated we we've been looking at this aspect throughout or this part throughout the past Thursdays and dealing with how that God would make known the the mystery of his will and calling out a Gentile bride and where we've been looking at that is looking there within the seventy weeks of Daniel and then looking at the last week knowing in that last week of how that Christ the Lord Jesus Christ he came and in the midst of that week he was cut off was three-and-a-half years of his ministry was cut off and then there's to be a resuming of that week within Israel but in the midst of the week here where he's been cut off we understand that all of that that the Jews they were blinded for our sake they they knew they knew the covenants they knew the promises they knew what was wrote there within the scriptures and to think about it that hound that if you would if we could look at it like this they knew the Scriptures and things so well that they probably could quote the one that you were quoting the before and afterwards but you begin to see that within all of this that was hidden within within the scriptures and how all of this would come out it would have it would be God that would reveal this when it was time for this mystery to be made known and when a mystery is made known we realised that God just doesn't unveil or unfold his word without there being a people who would be the match piece to that word that's being ministered or to be the expression of that word and we see how that Paul would make mention here by the unction of the Holy Spirit and Paul as we were looking at that in the scriptures I know many of these places that are familiar to us but Paul would write and say how that this revelation of that mystery that was hidden in God was made known to me by revelation and that that grace the grace of God that that might be minister among the Gentiles and to see that how that with with this where you and I were at of how that God would move upon Paul within that hour and the unction of the Holy Spirit as Paul would be able to declare as what we're reading here I'm a minister of Jesus Christ unto the Gentiles Paul administer the redeeming grace that that revelation would be so clear with that of Paul and has it would be ministered it would be more than just Paul's words and it's more than just what Paul was saying we know that what Paul was saying it was an unction by the Spirit of God and even though within that time to think about it Paul would be out there and he would be ministering among the Gentiles entombed who he was sent and without them even having a prior knowledge or any prior understanding of any covenants but yet the Holy Spirit would be able to so move upon the hearts of those who were actually ordained in that hour that when the Spirit of God would move upon their hearts through the preaching of the word it would it would cause faith to rise within their hearts within that word and there would be an understanding that would break upon their hearts and that's the same way that it is with you and I'm when the Spirit of God takes the word and he begins to break that word to our heart there's an understanding that breaks over our life that an understanding that man himself could never give to us but it's an understanding by an unction of the Holy Spirit taking that word and it says though that the word that we have read now it becomes an open to us or you take somebody who doesn't even know the scriptures whatsoever but yet they're ordained as a part of the body of Jesus Christ there will be something about the gospel that will sound and ring within their heart and something that they themselves cannot explain they can't get away from it but there is that that part that is ordained to live that is down there within them that when they hear the gospel trumpet it's something that raises within them to recognize that corresponding call I'm thankful for the grace of God tonight that we can truly look at that and see that in our own life it's the sovereignty of God it's beyond I it's blood it is beyond it has been and it will be beyond our ability in ourselves to understand it's simply the work of the Holy Spirit moving upon what he has already for ordained and placed in our lives so Paul would be moved by the Spirit of God to think of this how that Paul would be moved to go back clear through the Old Testament and under the leadership of the Holy Spirit he would begin to bring forth these things as God would make known to him concerning that of a taking of a Gentile bride and Paul look how Paul would take this out and he would minister this because we know that he was unto Abraham and his seed where the promises made what's how Paul let me just read a few places here in Galatians 3 verse 7 Paul said know you therefore that they which are of faith the same are the children of Abraham and the scripture foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith preached before the gospel unto Abraham saying in thee shall all nations be blessed so then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham notice the scriptures foreseen and how that the Holy Spirit would take and open that of the scriptures because remember it was no mystery that the Gentiles would be saved that was not a mystery that was wrote within the Old Testament that was wrote in many places all through that of the prophets down all the way through through the minor prophets so many places are put within there that was not a mystery even to think of how that when James would when there in acts 15 when he would talk and Peter you know they were giving witness where the Holy Ghost had fallen upon the house of Cornelius remember even James was saying how that in that time that Peter had testified that by the coming of the Holy Ghost there in the house of Cornelius it was God witnessing that he was going to take a people out of the Gentiles for his namesake but yet that understanding and that mystery as far as that of a bride of a wife that was not something that was given to Peter and to James at that time but that was given to Paul within that hour not to think about this let's just look at that scripture for a moment that the pouring out of the Holy Ghost and the giving of that of those seed that was gathered there within the house of Cornelius there a Gentile the pouring out of the Spirit of God is that where Peter could say that God was identifying he was taking a people out of the Gentiles for his name's sake because we realize that God's name is that of his life that in his nature that of his character he's pouring out of that life of that name of the Holy Ghost upon the believer so then it would and identifies then us as believers not with that of our first birth but now we have been lifted by the new birth and are identified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so now when we look at this notice how Paul is looking at the scripture this is why the Bible itself to a believer is not a book of history altogether but it is actually a book of prophecy and how to see that the one the very same Holy Spirit that moved upon the prophets the same one that there would be expressing this to Abraham Paul would pick it up and say the Scriptures foreseeing that God would justify the heathen by faith or through faith he preached the gospel unto Abraham now notice in Galatians three gone down there verse thirteen Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us where it is written cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith so the promise and remember how Paul and he's dealing with this here with this among the Galatians because remember there were those of false brethren who had crept in and were trying to take the people away from the work of redeeming Grace and begin to try to put the people back on the dependency of works of the flesh and Paul AE lays it out here that this promise itself it was made before the law ever came into existence it is a promise that was made that man could never keep but God made the promise when he made it to Abraham and this is why the covenant to Abraham is not a conditional covenant but it's an unconditional covenant because God made it Abraham and said I will bless you I will do this I have already you see it was already an unconditioned because it was not based upon man's ability to keep it or man's ability to bring it forth I'm telling you tonight this is exactly where we are as the seed of Abraham we are under that unconditional covenant where it's not us it's not our strivings it's not everything that we can do it's what God has already done it's his working our yielding he's already done it that's why the preaching of the gospel it's all in that of a finished work that our faith might be come to a place that we can recognize that and rest in that finished work we realized that he's already healed us he's already healed us he's already provided all that we have need of it is necessary that our faith would raise in will finished work notice how Paul would go on to say in verse 16 and to Abraham and his seed where the promises made and he saith not and to seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is Christ suppose laying it down bees are where the promises lay for the believer the promises that belong to the believer to Abraham's seed is in Christ this is our place of promise this is where all the promises are met this is where all the promises are fulfilled this is where we receive and have our promises in Christ in him for ye notice he goes on to say for ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus Lord be to God for as many as you have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ remembrance we looked at that it was not something that you and I gave ourself estate but it's God that deposit in that faith a measure of faith was given to you and I is that right for it is by grace through faith that we are saved it was God that would place that faith within you and I at the hearing of that word that faith would rise within that word in then this time and how that God would draw you and I unto himself to a place of complete submission that's what it is to be baptized in Christ have put on Christ it's where our will has become so lost in his will just like they lay you down in the tank down there it's the same way that God Himself baptizes you and me into the body of Jesus Christ it's not our struggle it's our arrest there is neither look how look how this is brought forth there is neither Jew nor Greek there is neither bond nor free there is neither male nor female for ye are all one in Christ Jesus and if you be Christ's then are ye Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise so if you are in Christ you are heirs of every promise and if the Holy Spirit is dealing with your life and he's calling you to that place let me tell you something the promise of the Holy Ghost is for you amen this promise is something that raises up that this promise of life this blessing of Abraham it's for me there's a longing a desire beyond just this life I'll tell you that's a blessing you realize that blessed are they that do hunger and thirst for righteousness for you shall be filled it's a blessing to even desire the Holy Ghost hallelujah now to think of this I want you just to think of this here for a moment of how that when we recognize how in the very beginning when God would lay things down in the book of Genesis that every seed was to bring forth of its own kind that a pine tree would produced the pine and so forth we could go on and on and it was to stay within that stay within that line of which God had made it so there would be that of a species that would be that which would be to continue and within that seed it would have within and let's say that of you know the the seed that would be within an orange tree it has within it there that that power to become whatsoever that God has spoken whatever God spoke that is what lays within that seed but all it takes is the right atmosphere it takes the right light takes the right moisture and then what has been spoken now becomes a manifestation so there within it how that we would find in the scriptures at one time you and I were not a people we were not a people but to think of how that God how that the Lord would look that wearing when we were not a people yet now in him we become a people one unit one body in him your fees - let's look at this for a moment Ephesians - Paul picks this up wherefore remember that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh who are called uncircumcision by that which is called the circumcision in the flesh made by hands that at that time ye were without Christ being aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of promise having no hope and without God in the world but now in Christ Jesus you sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ for he is our peace who hath made both one and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us who did this he did it we didn't know nothing about it but he knew us we knew nothing about the covenants nothing about the Commonwealth of Israel but he knew us glory be to God hallelujah having abolished in his flesh the enmity even the law of Commandments contained in ordinances for to make himself of Twain one new man so making peace and that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross having slain the enmity thereby and came and preached peace to you which were afar off and to them that were not you see God has no other way of getting out his message than by preaching it the opening what we read in Galatians 3 God preached the gospel to Abraham knew with me he never never turned it over to just the writings that they would read the writings there that would be given by Moses that in itself it would it would be God coming behind and preaching that word ministering those promises you realize that even when things themselves got under a burden when they were there building the tabernacle or the temple after they returned from Babylon you recognize the unction of the Holy Spirit that moves down and it picks up and begins to deal with the purpose among the people of God that they had slipped away from and the unction of the Holy Spirit begins to stir up what God has ordained for them to do so it's God communicated their the promises and preached this here under abraham notice how Paul would say and came and preached peace to you which were afar off and to them that were nigh so both to Gentiles and to Jews for through him we both have access by one spirit unto the Father is that right there were Jews there on the day of Pentecost that were born into the kingdom of God is that right then we find that how that that was open then we find with the house of Cornelius here is the key the Peter takes the key and that is open there in the house of Cornelius and the Holy Spirit is poured out upon the Gentiles remember the promise on the day of Pentecost was that as many as the Lord our God shall call even to them that are afar off that was speaking to you and I as the Gentiles no glory be to God but God was going to bring you and I not a man we would be brought nigh by the blood of Jesus Christ amen through that offering that was shared wearing back the Jews were blinded but yet through that offering there of the Holy Spirit now being released now through the offering of that blood you and I would be brought nigh and we're not just around the covenants but brother we have been brought into the covenant by the baptism of the holy ghost girl repeater God we're not just hanging around we're in Christ we're not just associated around something we're in Christ glory be to God think of it every time look when you look at Rahab's life Rahab could not just come into Israel so had to be a union a marriage that would bring her in is that right it had to be by that of a marriage and how that here she was outside of the camp but as she was outside of the camp it was some loaned them that would bring her in in through marriage so now here she is she comes in through him by the man it's not the woman that brings us into the covenants come on somebody it ain't about being a part of the church it's about being born of a man Christ Jesus he is the one that brings you and I into the covenants that's how it was with Ruth it was not Ruth bringing herself in but Ruth was a stranger is that right and they owe me herself even in the midst of herself where she said call me Mara call me that of bitter because of how that God has dealt with me remember here Ruth comes in in that time that says your God will be my god explain that to me you can't explain that the only thing that can be said is what the Prophet says in the Holy Ghost series where he said when a when Ruth forsook her land it was because Ruth had a vision what kind of a vision did she have it was something within her heart that was pulsating wherein Orpha was able to kiss the cheek of her mother and turned back but not Ruth Ruth herself said where you go I'm gonna go where you rest that's where Angela rest and your people will be my people they met your God will be my god I ask you what gave Ruth the love like that for Naomi it was ordained by God I ask you what is it that is given you and I beloved for one another it's ordained by God what is it that has put that the love and the desire to pray for the peace in Jerusalem for God to fulfill his word it's because Ruth Naomi Helen oh yeah we love Naomi because we realize that our time is ending she's gonna get her time we have access by one spirit unto the Father now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow-citizens with the Saints and of the household of God and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets Jesus Christ Himself being the chief Cornerstone and one time we were strangers no longer are we strangers amen a stranger meaning one who lives in a place without the rights of citizenship they live in this place but they don't have rights that citizens have you and I did not have rights within that of the Covenant but through Jesus Christ by the Spirit he made known to you and I this is your rights through union with me we are fellow citizens amen we possess the same citizenship with others you realize what it means to have citizenship in heaven you've got citizenship and let me say this to you it wasn't something that you married it it wasn't something that you earned you were always a part of it but the Holy Spirit came and sought you out and he makes what now would be your you're a stranger he unfolds himself to you and he brings you and I into him and we are therefore fellow citizens we have the rights as a citizen Tory that's why Paul was letting it be known whether you Jew whether you're Gentile whether you're Vince whether you're that but in Christ we are one because it's not a nationality that God is highlighting but God is highlighting himself in the life of the believer and that's what the baptism of the Holy Ghost does when we are brought into Christ it highlights our citizenship in him you realize what I'm talking about you off time you want many times there's places you come into and you sometimes you can even tell by the way people walk by the way they talk by the way they act you you begin to say hey you're not from this country are you you understand you know there was a time and I know I mentioned this tree before there's many times where they would say people would say I can tell you're American how because the way you walk I don't even know I walked round but that's what they said but we can tell you America without me even saying anything you understand but you see here's the reality when we look at this it is not something where you and I have to make ourselves something but the citizenship of heaven becomes reflected in our life because what our lives our lives reflect that country from which we have been birthed by the spirit of that land by the new birth and we reflect the citizenship of that heavenly country that's why that our sisters don't cut their hair it's because they're reflecting the citizenship of that country that's why we don't wear makeup because we're reflecting the citizenship of that country that's why we don't drink and lie and run around and over because we're reflecting the citizenship of that country hallelujah we've been born of that life we are citizens we are strangers here but were not strangers in him every promise belongs to you and I as believers pearl repeater God Amen fellow citizens with the Saints and of the household of God amen household belonging it's dealing with will you know with the household you've got your household I've got my household but this household we're talking about is the household of God amen the Church of the Living God amen Paul he goes on to describing in verse 21 in whom all the building in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto a holy temple in the Lord in whom ye also are builded together for in habitation of God through the spirit God assembling assembling each one where we were strangers but now through him by the blood of Jesus Christ we who were far off are made nigh for God to come and dwell remember this we're looking at that we were not a people remember how God would talk to Israel God would mention the Israel in Exodus 19 also in the book of Deuteronomy if you obey my voice you'll heed my Commandments then you'll be unto me a peculiar treasure above all the people of the world of this earth is that right so what is it that would separate the people from Israel from the rest of the nations what wasn't it would be the Living God as they would take the word and live by the word then it would actually separate them from the rest of the nations we understand that it was more than just them taking the word but remember if they had a heart listen to me now if they had a heart that was submissive to the word then the presence of God was able to come behind that word and he would be as a living presence of God there in the midst of Israel and that is what made the difference they had different they had different statutes and judgments and Commandments oh that's true but there had to be the presence of the one who gave it to be present there is that right but you see how that none of that in itself it was only speaking that there would come a perfection whereby that God himself through the unconditional covenant would actually assemble our people and even out of that which is coming out of the Jews in the 144,000 but yet how that God would assemble a group and a body of believers that they would give themselves to the word and the word would be reflected in their life by the living presence of the Living God and through that word moving within our life it brings an assembling together you understand it's just like when you think about when we're recovering that in Ezekiel 37 when you look upon the valley of dry bones what is it that told this bone to unite with this bone you didn't have a leg bone down here in a hip socket come on somebody you didn't have a stall where a foot belong everything itself was in its proper place and order what was it it was the time of the prophecy that was going forth as that prophecy was being spoken it held within it that intelligence of God that would direct every one of those bones right to where they belonged in the body because all of those bones represented the house of Israel that's the same way that it's been down through the ages where when the prophecy of the word is being made known it assembles that which is a part of the body in that hour and it brings you and I into position it's not us bringing ourselves in position it is Christ himself through the revealing obvious word it brings you an eye into position Oh glory glory be to God that's why Peter could say but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood an holy nation a peculiar people that you should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light which in time past were not a people watch how he picks this up from the book of Hosea in times past we were not a people but are now the people of God which had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy this word people here means it means that of those who are of the same stock and language we were not a people come on now we were all spread out throughout all nations but to think of how that the word itself how that God you can see how that God would direct so that the word would find and he will not in the renowned will not be one of his elect that are a part of that bride that will miss it that word will find everyone there will not be one of the bride body that will miss it that is God's word for God to see to it though you and I did not know we were of this stock but God knew like the woman at the word you might have been all covered over with all sorts of things but down beneath that there was that stop that was of the Tree of Life a lot of strains from the first birth but now through the new birth you receive that strain of predestination that was always ordained there and as the seed of life comes upon it it releases it a language think about it you and I were strangers we did not know this language come on somebody we didn't know this language you know what they tell you they tell you it's better if when you're one of your children is going to learn a language it's better that they learn it when they're baby coming up as a toddler this is why with the new birth there are companies a change of language Amen you aren't buying that the language of God where the church gets away from you understand what I'm talking about the language of God is the Holy Ghost if not talking about just Prince I'm not talking about just words I'm talking about the language and unction of the Holy Ghost hey man but we then are led by the Spirit of God oh my look how but you and I as Paul would say in another place he says that we are bound to give thanks only to God in 2nd Thessalonians 4 you brethren beloved of the Lord because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth well - he called you by our gospel to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ you were chosen to salvation come on somebody and you were chosen to sanctification of the Spirit choosing God as he makes known his word what does it do it's a love affair it is that where his word comes forth and it brings a yielding in our life you see friends this is why many times people don't go any further because they stopped yielding you've got to keep yielding it's yielding its yielding even in that of the very change of the body it's yielding sometimes a person gets up and will huh I gotta quit this and I gotta stop that and I gotta do all that all of those things you're mindful of that but you need to remember you have been chosen under sanctification of the Spirit say Lord release more of the power that moved upon my life Lord and let there come the flow of sanctification by the spirit where it's able to release that cleansing and separate and remove all of those habits from the world you are ordained to receive that sanctification ordained of God to receive the Holy Ghost you are deigned of God that your vessel would stay clean and clear and pure before him aren't you glad my let me move here just a little bit I'm just gonna skip a few things Paul would go on and he would talk about even that of the household of faith look in Hebrews 11:7 here you find that the Scripture speaks of how that Noah he was warned of God of things not seen as yet that which was spoken was not yet come there right but no event would deliver a message here's the mercy of God that God would send a message of impending judgment but if God sending a message of impending judgment remember with that message comes mercy and grace for those who will heed to the warning of that message that's coming just like when Jonah went down the Nineveh you asked me that Merton that message was taken there and those inhabitants of Nineveh were moved with repentance and God Himself removed from destruction is that right because they repented it turned away the wrath of Almighty God now the thing removed with fear prepared an ark to the saving of his house by the which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith I just want to look at that just there for just a few moments when we look at that of Noah's house we recognize this is more than just when we look at it in the scripture of just Noah's natural house but Noah's house would have been that which would be under that message that he had given in that hour there were many who came around it scoffs added didn't understand it but yet there were those who are ordained of which God knew just how much room to prepare you understand they didn't have any extra rooms or we got adjoining rooms y'all can just take those chickens in you know we just we over planned no it was just what was needed but God ministered the word through Noah as though everybody could be saved is that right and there was a place of safety within that of the ark so it was that of the household those who would actually be birthed by that revelation that Noah had receive from God that place of safety now let me just keep skipping along here you realize that within the scripture how that God had even referred to Abraham when in Genesis 18 where he would reveal himself to Abraham and God would make known that Abraham himself he says I I can't hide from Abraham what I'm about to do seeing that with Abraham that she shall surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him that was speaking about you and I is that right but to think how that that word that revelation would come forward and God had confidence in the revelation working through the elect seed of God that would come down there not everybody that can look back and say Abraham is my great-great-grandfather water not everybody was actually ordained and a part of that but there was some elect that were a part of the household of Abraham it was that which was a part of that promise that God had made to Abraham and to his seed you with me there were those that were looking for him there was inlet that we're looking for him is that right God would continue to open his word in his path down through there I got a hurry so we know and understand not to think of this the mystery of Abraham's household this is what I really want to just hone into just for a few moments that mystery of Abraham's household remember the Jews themselves you know even when it came you know to that of coming into the upper room remember they asked the Lord Jesus will at that time will that will thou at this time restore the kingdom unto Israel what they're asking him these are things that pertain to the Millennium when the kingdom will be set up on earth are you with me you see they didn't this this was not known but you see there was a household of Abraham and within the household it would be that that there would be that of the elect would be down through time that had been offering up the lamb in the place where God had chosen to place his name they would be offering the lamb now think of it they didn't see everything but it was by revelation let me just put it to you like this it's just how how it is to you and I got the revelation of Jesus Christ in this hour to our hearts it's the dearest thing that we have in this life is the revelation of Jesus Christ it's where we draw strength day by day it's the very thing that causes us to rise up in the morning that when all sorts of discouragement and everything will come away even in the midst of tests and trials what is it it's the revelation of Jesus Christ that has struck our hearts in that great Redemption there by the Holy Ghost and lets you and I know we are part of him and then this is the dearest part and dearest thing in our life that's why they were called pilgrims and strangers that revelation of the offering of the Lamb was not among the let has just something that was done it was an unction there was something inspired to their hearts just the way this word is inspired to you and I where others can look at it you don't have that same inspiration he doesn't have the same meaning but to you and I it's dear to our hearts hallelujah that is a separating Lord right there so to see this household of Abraham it would be that where the elect was offering down through time then you find here at the pouring out of the Holy Ghost you found that of Jews remember there was a remnant that was waiting on the coming of the Messiah right it was a small little group Semyon and a few others were waiting he's alright Jesus Church wasn't very big come on somebody it was a small church but you know what it was what identified that it was his he's because they were waiting on the promise hey man there was some who were looking right in the face of the word and said God can't lie they were waiting on the promise even to wear the same holy goes that spoke back down through time it moved upon Simeon it said you're not gonna adapt till you see the Lord's Christ and the same one that told him that is the same one that promised that Simeon Hill I wonder how family sometimes he got sick doctor said Simeon you don't have many more days you don't have many more hours but he said I can't go because he already told me I'm not gonna die till I see the Lord's Christ you know what it was it was that which was revealed to him glory be to God that gave him power and mastered these circumstances that would come his life think about how many said you're crazy look at this time this guy hears things from God oh my goodness what a juvenile thing what a funny-looking little guy look at him he must be off his rocker no he was actually moved by the Spirit of God so much to where he was sitting in his office the Holy Spirit can move down and say Samia get up from the chair you see he was in tune with God so much till God could speak plainly get up from your chair move on out here come on down here tell me what quotes he had to tell him to push back his chair Donegan quiet on me are you tell me what quotes he had to tell him how to go down the aisle you see what it was he had to know more than quotes he has to know the God who had inspired those prophets and when it came time for that word to be fulfilled he was a part of the house hold of Abraham and God would see to it that what he spoke to him he would confirm it [Music] the understand what I'm saying remember the Pharisees they knew that of all the history of Moses they could quote the quotes and everything else but they did not know that God who gave the message they did know the holy ghost who spoken by a divine unction they were absent of discernment what a dangerous hour in a dangerous time Abraham's household is comprised of the real Jews that remnant that was awaiting the Messiah and they recognized him his household he is also comprised of the elect among the Gentiles here with me think of this with Joseph now Joseph is off the scene and when he's away he is given a wife and his life is in his household but when his brethren come they were his brethren but not his wife but they were out that household and brother Graham said what Joseph was saying there is what he'll be saying at that time when he reveals himself to the brethren I have taken a Gentile bride you come home with me we're all gonna be one big family Wow because the name will also be revealed to them their glory be to God you see this is that same house of God that even that that Jacob my my my time just it don't stand still for nobody don't in this house of God remember we're here was was Jacob standing in Bethel remember when God made himself known to Jacob in Bethel and how that the angels of God the presence of God come down and Jacob would say in Genesis 28 this is none other than the house of God the gate to heaven we realized that it wasn't the natural place but it was God Himself expressing that he himself would provide for himself a house there right because God don't dwell outside of the house God dwells in a body and I write and what God revealed there to Jacob he made known his presence there at Bethel so much that Jacob then could take a rock and he would set the rock up in tight and said that when I return he said if God will bring me back to this place in safety here he said this stone which I set for a pillar shall be God's house when Israel comes and comes back into the true atonement they'll recognize the house of God because this house of God how fitting here it is in Bethel which would be man in Bethlehem as I write and to think of how that this house that it would be said an attack it would be that of a rock but to recognize that within this that the stone which would be the foundation and the dwelling place of the Lord which we would understand as the Lord Jesus Christ he is the foundation stone he is the building which the Lord built and through him and his spirit we have access and are brought into God's house or the house of God the Lord Jesus Christ because every true Christian is born in Bethlehem it's all right it's a house of God's bread what is bread bread is the staff of life they have man in the winner's but jesus said I am that true bread that coming down from heaven what's his speaking of that life that is given that you might have life he is that bread of life amen glory be to God think of how that even when Solomon you know he would he would make the statement Solomon was moved as David was moved think of this God never even asked David to build him a house first Chronicles 17 you think of that God never asked David to build him a house when did that inspiration come from David was in tune with God he was walking with God and that inspiration would strike his heart there needs to be a house for him to dwell there you see it was God's desire because it would be calm provide a house for himself a man it wouldn't be David that would do it yet David would lay up all the store the silver the gold and all those things but it would be Solomon that man of rest that would come about and he would actually build a house for God to come and dwell in there right three room house now think of him even how that it would be spoken there by Solomon Stephen would pick it up over here in the book of Acts that howbeit the Most High dwelleth not in a house made by hands that was only a tack pointing to that perfect house of God it was only showing and shadowing that what the desire was worth in David it would be Solomon to bring it forth it showed the longing desire that was there in God it would be through Jesus Christ that he would bring forth that house into manifestation that house no wonder David could say except the Lord build the house David labor labor in vain the right mama I'm just trying to I'm just trying to move on here this house this body remember here comes the Tabernacle walking there into the river Jordan comes down at the at the at the right time and as he comes down there in the river Jordan the heavens are open he's baptized up out of the water the heavens are open and here comes the dove coming down God was identifying that now through this obedient son the son of God the Lamb of God that same spirit would now come upon the sons of God and the dollars of God the same Holy Spirit that sought glory be to God that sought him out and told him go down to the river today's the day come on somebody in the Easter seal 1965 Milgram said the Spirit of God sought him out in perfect obedience and he came down there and he was washed there within the water is that right he came there and then what happened the Spirit of God come upon him and he said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased to dwell what is the outpouring of the Holy Ghost it's identifying the sons and daughters of God it identifies those that are of the household of Abraham it identifies those that were chosen in God before the foundation of the world and the Holy Ghost is the outpouring of his name and remember it is now his name being reflected in the family of God that which is in heaven and that which is in earth his life on display is that right only one place is one place for safety that's in Christ Jesus amen this is why the question that would be proposed how do we get into that church how do we get into that body how do we get into that house well you know he wouldn't be very thoughtful if you didn't have a house that had a door on it windows are nice but windows aren't made for you to come in through there is a prescribed entranceway or glory a Manor door itself it shows you don't have to look around the house when you go to look at around not one of you walk up to somebody's house and go to their window if you start going up through a window to come in their house you're gonna find yourself in the back of a police car because you know why they're gonna regard you by the way that you're approaching it and going in you're either a thief or a robber come on somebody but there is a door that is provided and there's no way that you and I could get into the sheepfold although we were ordained as the sheep of God but he the great Shepherd came down and became the door for you and I a man that you had asked to come into this sheepfold into this household this is a house that we were made for this is a house that we were made for we were made to live in this house we were made to live in this presence no wonder David could say in the Book of Psalms blessed is that man that is planted in the courts of the Lord he shall flourish glory be to God by one spirit by one spirit are we baptized into one body one body that mystical body of the Lord Jesus Christ let me just say it like this I don't have time to quote it but the Prophet tells us like this I believe it's in five identifications of the church he said that when you have responded to that call of the Holy Ghost into the mystical body of Jesus Christ and you have been baptized by the Holy Ghost into the body of Jesus Christ you are a full member right then you understand that you're a full member we're still growing but you have full access hey men you have a right and an access to every redemptive blessings o my house like the Prophet said if I was somewhere he said and there might be on this shelf it's too high for me to see what's up there I'm gonna get a ladder and climb up there now remember the way up is down and down is up so how do I get up there pray prayer takes you to places because remember prayer brings you and I into that desire through a submission Lord let thy will be done in earth even as it is in heaven a man is two working of that citizenship in our life for by one spirit are we baptized into one body this house that were ordained for go repeated God like the prodigal son he was down there in the Pigpen but he got to thinking about the father's house are you with me the age of the Lord began to work on his heart he began to think about his father's house he knew where he was at he knew the house that he was in that was not his father's house he knew in my father's house the servants are treated better than this he got a longing to come back home Joe repeater God he got a longing to come home and what was it the same longing that stirred up it is hard to come home his father knew that he would return and his father when he saw him afar off let me tell you something he sold you and I afar off and he came running for you and I he came after you and I he knew we would have no way to get back so he came and said I am your way back I will take your blame I will take your reproach and I will bring you back home [Applause] there will be to God the same angel of the Lord the Commission Eleazar under the word of Abraham go get a bride for my son go get a wife and here Rebecca comes out to the water of life at the evening time how does he know because Abraham said you go to my father's house I want my son is to have a bride that's blood relation come on somebody so I don't want you're going to hear the house of the Canaanites how do what you're going to then of the the three God's house and all these other things into Lourdes and home together I want you to go to my father's house there I've got some kindred there's some kinfolk there come on somebody you realize that you and I were always we were ordained as a part of the household of God but the life we live did not reflect that household that we were really off we reflected that of our first nature but when the Spirit of God began to deal with our lives he began to stir up our life go get some water right now when when I turned got the water and what happens then from that point we begin to notice there are those beasts of burden those camels the great Holy Ghost we begin to water the Holy Ghost you see the Holy Ghost set has come now to pack us into the presence of our bridegroom we begin to be stirred in our hearts there as the word as the Living God is becoming a life to us and we give ourselves to it let me tell you something tonight you want the Holy Ghost start watering the Holy Ghost you say how do I water it by giving and saying Lord thank you for calling the Lord thank you for drawing me Lord the promise is mine Lord this promise belongs to me you need something in your life tonight go to watering that beast of burden there go to giving way and allowing the Holy Spirit to have the right-of-way brother let me tell you something he'll pack you from his father's house he'll pack you into the tent there of Sarah's tent he'll pack you there from earth to glory hill path you from sickness unto hell he'll pack you into the baptism of the Holy Ghost that is the power of God amen hallelujah this house that you and our deigned in weird ain't in this house Amen it's in this house where the family of God has identified hallelujah we come to this building we gather here we gather to hear the word of the Lord we gather that our lives would be shaped and molded into his glorious image we gather here for that but remember when we come here we're gathering much more than just a building there'll be some and there has always been that will come here and this is no more than just a building it's no more than just a church come on somebody but you see it's got to be something that it's more than just a church we are not gathering here just how to address just to come into a building but we are gathering here that our lives would be molded in shape and here we are as part of the family of God not by an association but we are part of the family of God by the baptism of the Holy Ghost not because we say we believe the message but because God Himself has personally vindicated our lives as believers we're not just associated we got citizenship hallelujah we got rights and you know what he loves to come and enforce the rights come on somebody he loves when he's called on the scene that he can come and enforce those rights that's given to you amen when you can stand on the promise I don't care if you feel it or not but you're standing on that promise your faith is roads said this promise belongs to me as a seed of Abraham there might have been something that's been taken from you but you can arm yourself there knowing that the angels of God or a bound around that word and as you're standing in there you say I'm going after locked hello somebody I'm going after this me I'm going after this situation right here maybe there's something that the enemy has taken away from your life maybe it's the joy of his salvation you've got a lot tonight to ask for the joy of the Lord to return because the joy of the Lord it belongs in the house of God and you and I have been assembled and brought into the body of Jesus Christ and tonight I'm looking at lively stones that had been assembled together by the divine architect of Almighty God and the Holy Spirit moving upon our lives like he moved upon the bones there in the house of Israel to come together to unite for what that he himself inhabits this house of God so then his body his body his broad body this is the house of God it's the house of God this is where his children are his children that are born of his genes inside of this house is where the quickening power is you remember as I said in the book of Haggai but here when they built remember the first the first temple they built and then when they built that second temple that temple in itself the way that it looked it had as far as it looks had no glory compared to the first one but it wasn't a natural glory it would be the glory of the latter house would see would sit would would that of I don't want to say the word it would be greater than that of the first house why because was that right there have God it led by unction and to think within that house the very God Himself the Lord Jesus Christ would come to stand in that temple he would spend in that temple and say there is one that is greater than the temple I'm telling you in your life and in my life there's one greater than the temple hey man is that is the glory of the latter house it is the glory of God that is poured out on the house of God hallelujah he's been assembling he's been building the foundation has been laid and he comes down in the hour that we're living the headstone comes to cap off a finished work the mystery of God down through the ages that mystery of his riches in the lives of you and me Christ in us the hope of glory I say it like this tonight by Joshua as for me and my house we will serve the Lord as for me and my house we will serve the Lord amen that's what the Holy Spirit that's what the Lord Jesus Christ is declaring as for me and my house we're going to live by the word a man we're gonna reflect the glory of God not by our will but by his will amen let's stand tonight one body one body the church the church the house of God Peter would refer to it a spiritual house Paul unfolds it even more of that of Christ and the bride husband and wife a great mystery of the church to think what he's done in our lives here's the other promise in my father's house are many mansions the earnest of the Holy Spirit in our hearts as believers it gives us the assurance as Paul when I read in the opening scripture he gives us power authority gives us joy it gives us hope because we know that if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved we've got one waiting hallelujah in that great household of God how did we get in there by him by him by him him touching our hearts him dealing with our life it's the same way tonight if you don't know the Lord in that way it's the same Holy Spirit the same one that deals with your life that is whispered to your heart is the same morning you say brother Samuel what what does he want he just wants surrender he wants surrender that's the same thing in each of our lives that have been baptized into this body this household of God the reflection of that name reflection of that life here's a here we are living in a closing moment closing time it's a time where all this is everything's being finished up these things God making it so clear to you and I it's time but I want you to remember I think over and over tonight the Holy Spirit is made it clear in the house of God you have an access god don't want you acting like a beggar even tonight if there's a longing and he's letting you know you need to come into the house you know maybe let me bring you in remember you're not a beggar this promises to you and then even once you're in there every promise is to you you're not a beggar your sons and daughters have gone whatever the promises that's upon your heart you take that before the throne of God and let the Holy Spirit who gave the promise and laid it upon your heart you let him come and enforce that promise let's just pray your Lord Jesus lord I pray that the words Lord that has been given tonight Lord broken up but I pray that God that the unction of the Holy Spirit has taken it into every heart ward [Music] Lord Jesus may there not be one that's gathered here tonight live under under the privileges Lord God if there's one that's been robbed of the privilege of being a son and daughter of God may they take the promise tonight and say Lord that's my promise you made that promise you're the one who's given me that hunger now Lord I'm asking that
