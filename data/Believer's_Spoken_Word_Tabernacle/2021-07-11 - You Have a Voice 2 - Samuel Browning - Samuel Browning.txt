the gold that's on the inside when sickness comes no matter what comes our way lord it only declares your life on the inside of us lord the lord i pray that you would just help me lord to step aside for a few moments lord your god that that you could take a gift that you placed in my life lord just like this microphone lord that we would use in order that the people might be able to hear a little bit better lord you're going to ask that lord that i would be nothing lord but just an instrument lord may you come may the may the inspiration of the holy spirit just set down lord and just your god begin to reveal and vindicate and take the word to our hearts lord you're gonna ask right now lord that father that every every spirit lord your god would be brought subject to the name of the lord jesus christ lord god for we know that there is authority here so lord we take the authority lord over every unclean spirit lord god and we ask lord god that you would just move in a very special way lord you know the needs that's among us lord you know father lord from whether it's sickness in the body in the spirit lord there in the soul lord you're a healer lord god you're the one lord who ministers healing in every realm of our life lord so we just asked god this morning that you would just come in a very personal way lord as i invite you to this platform lord we invite you lord to our pew lord we invite you lord to speak to us lord in a personal way this morning we invite you lord god that you would just come among us lord and just be the same yesterday today and forever lord dear god we put no restrictions on you lord god we just ask lord that you would just come in a very personal way lord god we love you and we thank you father we just give ourselves to you now lord in the name of the lord jesus christ amen and amen amen god bless you this morning if you'll turn with me to leviticus 25 i'd want to go to verse verse 8. am i out here do i have some in here okay i'm going to really need that verse 8 and thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee seven times seven years and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month in the day of atonement shall you make the trumpet sound throughout all your land and you shall hallow the 50th year and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof so notice these are this is a set time by god this is not something that israel that has come up with this is the feast of the lord they are appointed seasons of god and god has already declared this that in this time you're to cause the trumpet to sound throughout all your land and the 50th year you shall hallow and proclaim liberty so if we're not asking anybody can we proclaim liberty god has a set time this is the time of liberty it shall be a jubilee unto you and ye shall return every man unto his possession and ye shall return every man unto his family and verse if we could go down to verse 13 in the year of this jubilee shall you return every man unto his possession amen may god bless you and bless the ring of the word as you're being seated i just want to say before i maybe get into to ministering here this morning i want to say we just so appreciate your your prayers while we were there last well just this past week here down at the believer's youth camp it started last saturday and it went through thursday evening the the services i didn't know they were going to do this or else i would have let you know i let the young people know when i got down there as soon as i found out that they were going to be streaming the services and so the services are archived there the video and that's archived the the the thursday morning service that we spake there well they were videoing it but lightning struck and so it was it was quite a quite a moment you know when we were ministering i just had make uh made a thought um i made a statement of just where we were in the middle of ministry i said god is a great big god and went boom and the lights went out in the building you say what happened then we just started dancing the young people were already up and they just started dancing and shouting and just moving around you know and and just just as such a liberty and you know it was a tremendous tremendous time i i just can't even begin to even tell you um there's no way of knowing how many deliverances that took place in that service homosexuality just just those demons just just removed just just cast away and lives that you know that that just set free you know from pornography set free from you know so so many other things that you just go right down through the list fear and anxiety and on and on and lives being filled with the holy ghost i um you know and i i just it's just so wonderful to see that and you see you see the young people they you know i had to we had to just cut it off when we're preaching because they kept on pulling they were pulling and pulling and pulling and it was tremendous uh because they were hungry they were hungry and they they probably stood most of it more of the time than they were sitting matter of fact i'm i'm convinced of that and so it just was a tremendous tremendous time there in in the meeting of what god has done and you know that's not just one place where it's not just happening there but it's all throughout the bride body i mean just announce it like this the move is on for the bride amen the revival is on for the bride of jesus christ and i believe it's going home time amen so it was just tremendous to see that and and the things that's taking place and you know um i just so appreciate uh your prayers and just to see what god has done and i ask you just to continue to keep me in prayer because i'm still a little weak right now even in my body and and um but we just want to turn our attention here to to the word here for a few moments and uh you know as we're we're looking at this thought on you have a voice and when we think of this of the jubilee it's set forth in the scripture remember everything that we look at even in the old testament there is much much prophecy that is given in the old testament that we know that is is to be fulfilled within the new testament many many things that spoke of the groom the lord jesus and he fulfilled that part and there's many parts within that that also that speaks of the bride we know there's prophecies that have been spoken in the old testament regarding even that of israel coming back into her position and you know when you you think of it you know in this regard that god he designated this was a type that when the land itself knowing that there would come times where debt would incur and situations would take place to where that people would actually be removed from what rightfully belonged to them but just because they were removed from it did not take it away from belonging to them but but it only it remained in its place so the inheritance did not move from them or even with them but god would grant their his grace that would actually move in a sovereign time that there would be a sounding of a trumpet is actually the shofar the ram's horn and it would actually be blown and it that through the sounding of that of that that declaration it had a meaning now there might have been you know others that were around and they could hear a sound taking place into them they maybe have a question on what's what's taking place or what's going on it might have just seemed like a foolish noise or it might have just seemed like you know well somebody's just blowing a horn or something but but to those who were actually true born israelites sons of god it had a meaning to their life as a matter of fact when they were they were in a place and of debt and trying to work off of debt and labor and it didn't matter if they had been in that in that situation let's say that they had entered into it after two years from from from a jubilee that had just sounded they would be there for 48 years but there might come another one who entered into to bondage or to debt and it was maybe only one year from the 50th year it didn't matter how close it was or how far it was this was a sovereign act of almighty god that when the 50th year come the horn or the trumpet was going to sound and that sound had a meaning within it that could designate to the sons of israel that you can go back to your inheritance you don't have to ask nobody you don't have to ask the master can i go free uh w will will you stop bothering me no the the sounding of that of that horn or that trumpet it held within it a meaning it held a voice it held inspiration and it held authority you see there was an authority that passed over their ears and down into their heart that they knew that the days of slaving this is the last day this is the last moment i'm no longer going to be a servant i do not carry this back with me let me tell you something whatever they were working in that field did not go back to their inheritance there they went back to their inheritance as free sons of god and this is exactly what god would be speaking to you and i he would be speaking in a greater measure that for the sons of god as there came a fall in there in the garden of eden and here we come back under we come under a bondage we come under a servitude of sin and enslaved by by by that birth of a woman of that first nature that no matter how how how how good a person tries to be or how much they try to better themselves they can never get away from the condemnation that's over their life why because it's still under a sexual birth blood and there's only one thing that can actually come and now move for that sexual birth blood and that would be there must come a blood on the scene that is greater than the sexual birth blood there must come a blood that has within it a power that is able to loosen it from its past and actually tied in to what its inheritance really is you see it's a true inheritance in the land and you know many of you as bible readers you know that that inheritance when it was designated to a certain tribe it could never leave that tribe that which belonged to judah it always remained to judah and and so forth and zebulun and whatever more their boundaries and their borders always remained the same they could never ever it was never a changing of it because that was their inheritance and those that were a part of that family let's just say it's judah they their their inheritance lay within the boundaries that were given to judah so if there they were under that standard when it came time for the jubilee to sound it might have been a man out of the tribe of judah that man would not run into the inheritance of reuben because that's not his inheritance but the sounding with letting no return to your inheritance you so you see that the sounding would also be the call to return but if you're going to return to something you've got to know who or what you're returning to and the way back must also be revealed now when we when we see it in this manner it was an act of god i love how brother rahm says that in another place he says it was an act of god's grace you see this was not an act of man at all but the jubilee itself was a sovereign act of almighty god and notice i i want to read this here out of return in jubilee brother graham says now a man and his family could go back to their original inheritance if they could hear the jubilee a trumpet sound and know what it meant to them if they heard the priest sound the trumpet the trumpet is the gospel you see the reason many cannot go back is because the trumpet is given an uncertain sound this is why that a trumpet itself must give a certain sound you say what do you mean by a certain sound i'm talking about a positiveness that comes not just by the letter but comes by god himself getting in his word and he begins to sound out liberty his presence jubilee authority to our lives you see it removes any question so what's it doing it's putting our faith in the word of almighty god you see what it does faith in yourself you'll never rise up faith in your thinking you'll stay there you'll stay there but if your faith gets placed in the word of god oh my and the spirit of god begins to move and to catch us away from our earthbound thinking and all thoughts of defeat and well i cannot do this or can i do that but there must come an inspiration that's greater than anything that man could give there must come an inspiration that would cause our eyes of faith to begin to rise and look beyond circumstances and no matter how bleak they are no matter how great they are there's an inspiration that has life in it authority in it has power in it and brother it ministers to the depths of our soul to where we go from saying i don't know if it could be or maybe it's not for me but the inspiration of god it changes the atmosphere from if it could be or it might be it changes it to a place of it shall be this is my inheritance so this inheritance when they hear it and they know what it means they know that that's their inheritance you see what if a trumpet's sounding and the trumpet says well all you got to do is believe that jesus is the christ and that's it you're born again that's an uncertain sound because it's not dealing with what is the real problem and the real cause the real problem is that first birth it's not dealing with that sin nature and so when we think about it an inheritance like that or all you got to do is shake the preacher's hand or all you got to do is you know believe brother branham's a prophet let me bring it down in our rings all you got to do is you don't believe the doctrines of the message but it never deals with sin nature you can believe all the doctrines of the word and you can look at them and say well that's true and that's a man but there's got to come something than just an agreement with the doctrines that's part of it we must be able to say amen but there must come a life of that word that deals with that first baby that first birth because that's the problem come on now many times that ain't the doctrines of it it ain't doctrines what you what your what we deal with is that of a first nature where that first man is still alive [Music] come on now but there's got to be one that's able to bring death to that first man how does he bring death by calling us to life and recognize that there's one that's here greater and that's not who you really are you are a son and daughter of god oh my when they hear it they know what it means i mean look if somebody in the word could tell you well god don't require that no more then why don't we throw the whole bible away then i'm gonna just put it straight why don't we throw it all away then if we can't have confidence that god keeps his word he said i'm god and i changed enough he said i won't alter what went out of my mouth are you with me god ain't changing nothing as a matter of fact the final scriptures in the book in revelations 22 said whosoever adds to it or takes away his part will be taken out of the book of life let me tell you something on the day of judgment there's going to be many people that are disappointed the drunkard won't be disappointed he knows where he's going the prostitute ain't going to be disappointed she knows where she's going but a many a church member is going to be shocked they're going to be disappointed when they wake up in hell and say somebody told me that i was all right but brother we're not under the sounding of an uncertain sound we are under the sounding of the word of god what does that do it brings a faith and a courage and a faith in that word that you and i can stand as sons and daughters of god when they hear it and they know what it means they heard it on the day of pentecost is that right now there were many that heard it on the day of pentecost and said these guys are drunk right what is this but then you had some that heard it and there was conviction that set in i'll tell you that's a blessed thing in this hour we're living in an hour where where where people move without conviction come on now but it takes the holy ghost to bring conviction to a life let me tell you something if the preaching of the gospel and the holy spirit doesn't bring conviction to your life you're doomed it takes the holy ghost to bring conviction to your life you say brother samuel how did you pray well i'll tell you what if somebody's going the wrong way i pray god turned their world upside down god you know how to take them from the top and put them on the bottom you know how to turn their life around brother samuel you'd actually pray that done it many times god knows how to get your attention when maybe you think you're too high you're too good or maybe it might be a situation that is entirely different but god knows how to get your attention brother what is it about it's about our soul god take peace from their life don't let them sleep brother samuel you don't love me oh no i love you i want to see your soul i want to see your soul make it you can have everything in this life and you'll still end up in hell but if you ever meet the lord jesus christ in the redeeming grace and the blood that's been shed for you brother you're the richest man or woman that's upon this face of the earth when they hear it they know what it means so there was a sounding that went out what must we do to be saved so when the sound went forth it had a meaning to them they didn't call it you know these are drunk but it had a meaning to their life and so how did they respond peter then how the trumpet is being sounded notice the certainty in the word is sounding out in that hour repent and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ repentance is not a haphazard event repentance isn't well you know god i was born in this sorry family and i was like that ain't repentance that's worldly sorrow you want somebody to feel sorry for you but when repentance is where you recognize you're wrong and you abort the wrong that's in your life no excuses for it no no excuses you accept the responsibility that god i'm sorry that i have left lived under the influence of the enemy in my life and lord i recognize that freedom has come what are you doing instead of heading this way you're now heading this way what are you heading towards you're headed back to your inheritance is that right and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ because who's whose name are you under as judah went to judah zebulon went to zebulun reuben went to reuben then the real children of god come under the name of the lord jesus christ to recognize that our borders our boundaries our inheritance is in jesus christ and he is the word and we hear the call of the word that's why the scripture said that he gives the holy ghost that he sounds forth his name when they hear it they know what it means and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost somebody say shall we shall is not a maybe shall does not mean shall mean certainty over and over we could go through the scriptures on the shelves blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled not a question it's a certainty and they know that that's their inheritance no matter where where they lost how far they went back whatever they had to do they had the privilege to come and receive again their inheritance so it didn't matter what they were under it didn't matter what what what type of a condition that they were in the condition itself is not who they were are you with me they might have been under this sexual demon or under this and this thing was ruling on their life but it had nothing to do with who they really are you see the word itself identifies you for who you really are what's that doing that gives you a strength and a courage to recognize i don't have to remain under this bondage any longer i'm not a servant i'm a son of the living god i don't have to stand here and be moved about as a slave i'm a son of the living god what does that the sounding of the word is that right it didn't matter what they had lost or how how far they'd went the devil will always try to whisper in your ear you've went too far let me tell you something if you went too far the holy ghost wouldn't be dealing with your life if the holy ghost ain't dealing with your life but you're in a heap of trouble right now but the holy spirit when it's dealing with your life and how as it's moving in that life what's it doing it brings to a place that maybe a person has been in and out and up and down and never really come in to their inheritance they've heard about it quoted it they've talked about it they've even listened to it and even at times it thrilled them but they never came into that inheritance and then the enemy you know something will sidetrack them and then here the enemy will come again and say well you know what you've been in and out and up and down and everything else but there is something that is sounding in that life that there is nothing in this world that holds any interest for him as a matter of fact it wouldn't matter if everything the devil can heap on you he can never keep you from your father are you with me the spirit of god begins to sound right out it does not matter i've done this i've done that i've done this but if the spirit of god is still dealing with your heart it shows that there is grace for you what do i do lay everything aside and run to him run into the inheritance because you ever get in that inheritance brother there's no going back amen are you hearing me there's no going back there's nothing to go back to you've been united with god's choosing for your life oh my my my now notice how this drama is like a drama that's being unfolded you know as you look through the scriptures we read of that last uh the last last week when we were together in ephesians 1. and i'm not going to read that here this morning but i want to tie a few of those places in we have been blessed with all spiritual blessings in christ amen these are not sensations these are blessings he had chosen us in him before the foundation of the world in hebrew in ephesians 1 5 having predestinated us unto the adoption or the placement the positioning of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will so this is all in in the very counsel and the mind of almighty god as a matter of fact this is a drama that is being unfolded god could never make man to sin but god put a man on freemore agency and remember how that the bible describes how that the woman she was deceived but adam was in the transgression is that right adam stepped out you know as he was here with his wife in united there with his wife he steps out and he takes he takes her her sin upon himself because remember when god when god spoke uh to that of the woman and the woman herself you know and all these things why hast thou done this and and who did this remember god laid the responsibility or he's bringing it to a place of adam and he's looking because adam has to give a responsibility because she is identified in him that's why god could not touch her are you with me this is why that even even when we have been we are united with the lord jesus christ and let me say this before you ever even come to the realization that i'm a son and daughter of god i mean realization by real birth and positioning you realize that there's nothing before that could ever touch you or take you until god dealt with your life there is nothing i don't care how many automobile accidents i don't care how many things that came your way you might had to duck your head and it went flying on by there is nothing that could take you why because just like moses told pharaoh we are not leaving out of here with even a hoof behind you see when god he let us know he's got our names engraved in the palm of his hands you say brother samuel what are you talking about i'm telling you that we are not in a haphazard event we are in a drama that's being unfolded the word this is not something that's wishy-washy and up today and down tomorrow that's not the word of our god the word of our god is a solid place that you and i can stand on where the lord jesus said heaven and earth shall pass away but my word shall never fail because why it's a solid place what we see happening right now the way that god is dealing with your life right now the way that your life is expressing him in this hour do you realize you were part of the sons of god that shouted for joy that he drew job's attention to you realize you were part of those who never went along with satan's websites i mean his rebellion there in heaven you realize you were part of those who stood in that hour you say how can that be because you're standing right now this word you didn't remember it but this word has stirred up a gene on the inside that lets you know you were always a part of god that's why the devil hates predestination because predestination clearly declares this has been your lot before there was modern molecule you said what are you saying i'm not asking for something that don't belong to me i'm i'm claiming and taking what rightfully belongs to me this always belonged to me the life that i live now is the life that always belonged to me it was my inheritance to live and to manifest god our father as a son of god it was your inheritance as a daughter of god to manifest the living god you see this inheritance by predestination that we recognize in our lives that as brother brown would lay this out and let me just refer to it he said jesus he never left me an inheritance my inheritance was already given to me you say well what was the problem then i had no way to be able to tap back into this i had no way to get back there you see they were the israel where it was enslaved and there was absolutely no way for them to get back into their inheritance what had to happen there had to come a sovereign act of god to where that trumpet would be blown in that 50th year and what would it do it would give them the authority to lay everything down and return back you see that is what when god became flesh it couldn't be nobody else than god god himself became flesh in order to do what that the price itself could be paid the sin debt could be settled that you and i could go back to our inheritance you see he paid for it and then he brought you your inheritance because why it's the spirit of god that the holy spirit are you with me now the holy spirit is your portion it is that of life you see this is why the holy ghost when you could look at a person and they could say i've received my inheritance boy i'm under the anointing of the holy ghost and yet you look at their life they're still smoking and looking at things they ought not look at and running around out here and doing this and doing that you're not seeing a life that's living by the inheritance sure the holy spirit can come upon them that's exactly right but brother remember the holy spirit is a quickening spirit what does he come to do he comes to quicken that seed that word on the inside and that's where he abides the holy spirit does not abide on your flesh he does not abide on your spirit but he takes his abode there in that sea in that place that he has reserved for himself you see god has provided in this hour a place that he might reveal and express himself why he is jehovah jireh in your life he manifests himself he is jehovah jireh when the rest of the world is going the way that they're going yet god has reserved unto himself a remnant that would believe the word and would be filled with his spirit he paid the price and then brought us back to our inheritance i mean there's not one of you would look at your inheritance and say well you know i believe this inheritance but if there's still claims on it it's not fully under the inheritance the inheritance is where there is no bringing back of of the holes of the rakes or whatever tool it was or whatever instrument or whatever bondage it does not come back to the inheritance it's still there let me just say this to you the word itself is a wonderful thing and to enjoy but remember what the word is coming to do the word is giving you the authority to lay down that habit it's giving you the authority to cast down that spirit it's giving you the authority to rise up but you've been bound with it so long until it's become something that's just a part of you i say denounce that devil in the name of the lord jesus christ and lay it down and return back to your inheritance listen you don't know how many times i've been prayed for i'm asking you right now not to recite how many times you've been prayed for i'm asking you do you believe what the word has done for you hallelujah i'm talking about a place of victory amen are you hearing me i'm talking about a place of victory i'm talking about a place where you can really express yourself as a son and daughter of god you see like joshua joshua himself remember he had to he divided what belonged to israel joshua was not the one that decided judah goes over here and reuben goes over here and no that was already decided before the foundation of the world but their birth held within it a mystery when that name was called out it held within it the placement in that land oh my so if the same inspiration that was in the mind of god and that same inspiration would hit the mothers in the birth and they would call out that name and it would lay down a characteristic in the land of israel for that name zebulon judah whatever more then it would take the same inspiration to come to joshua and what was joshua doing when he was dividing the land it was the inspiration of almighty god that was dropping down on a vessel of humanity that had surrendered its thoughts to almighty god and joshua would stand there and he would minister the inheritance are you with me now you see that's what god has done in the evening time brother this message is not the inspiration of a seminary it's not the inspiration of schools of man but this is the inspiration of almighty god that has come down to divide to you and i our inheritance our portion our place our part in the body of jesus christ which is the word of the living god to anybody else it sounds like foolishness why no inheritance oh to all those nations that were around because some of them in there were not israel like born they were bondmen the bondwoman never went free in the jubilee never only those who were born sons what are you saying that we were always sons and daughters of god amen those who were bought in from other nations they could never go free under the jubilee they still had to remain and they served and they served and they served they can never go free but you see that's why this word holds meaning to you it's come to declare liberty to you now to some people just turn it down just a little bit then right here i'll give you permission to do that you see the rest of them of a bondman they'd have to continue they they would continue on to serve because it did not minister an authority to them to be able to rise up and to walk on in to an inheritance because they didn't have any inheritance among the land you see let's just put it let's just put the devil on notice right now when the enemy wants to get on your shoulder and try to point out all your faults all your mistakes and he wants to try to tell you you must not have any inheritance in this land then you tell me why he's wasting his time running his mouth he's never told the truth he's a liar are you with me he's a liar and a murderer what's he trying to do he's trying to destroy your confidence in the word he's not going to tell you that this message ain't the truth he's not going to tell you well the holy ghost ain't real notice how he switches now and he begins to tell you this isn't for you what should i do call him a liar and denounce it don't talk with a liar if they've been alive they're still a liar there'll always be a liar what should i do rise up in the truth of god's word because that's what holds the real identity of who you really are [Applause] listen you don't know how many times i failed but let me take your attention away from your failures and look at the one who has already standing victorious [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah notice in leviticus 25 23 the land shall not be sold forever for the land is mine so once again it belonged to god the land belongs to god their inheritance was what was given to them by god for you are strangers and sojourners with me and in all the land of your possession you shall grant a redemption for the land now notice this here oh my as we could we could look at that you know how has it belonged to that tribe and and that inheritance belonged to them now remember we we came into this place even last week of how that this this being a type israel could fall back into uh you know a bondage the the sons of israel could fall right back into that into a bondage again after that jubilee had come why because it was only a type you see this is why that the blood of bulls and goats they could come and offer the blood of bulls and goats it was a covering so they could come and have fellowship with god but it only it only covered it never atoned for sin it never dealt with the real root of the problem now man if a man came back and committed the same wrong in one year's time that man died because why because you see that was speaking of in a greater measure of the strength of the one sufficient sacrifice that when that sacrifice not only was made but accepted and then the life that lived in that sacrifice would come back upon the worshipper this is where paul said for for by one offering he has perfected forever them that are sanctified why it becomes the very strength in your life because the nature or the desire of sin has passed from you is that right so now there there was a true land that was being spoken of a true land now let's read here in romans 5 14 the bible says nevertheless death reigned from adam to moses even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of adam's transgression who is the figure of him that was to come so even those who didn't go according to adam's transgression but they were still under the reign of death all those things reigned because of that birth that came through him by disbelieving the word but not as the offense so also is the free gift the free gift for it if through the offense of one many been dead much more the grace of god and the gift by grace which is by one man jesus christ hath abounded unto many and not as it was by one that sinned so is the gift for if the judgment was by one to condemnation but the free gift is of many offenses unto justification oh my for if by one man's offense death reigned by one how much more they which receive abundance of grace of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one jesus christ or you see what happened here it's the changing of that ring where a life was under the reign of death and all the things that came with it fear and all the all the evil that came with it all the sin all the attributes it was death that was reigning there but now through and by the lord jesus christ has one represented us in in death or in that uncondemnation now comes forth one if the very righteousness of god that you and i might reign in life by jesus christ it's changed it in other words we are no longer the tail but we have become the head are you with me in other words we have no we are no longer on the ones that are enslaved but now we are the ones that's ruling simply put and faith is our victory brother graham said the sin that once ruled you you now rule it you are a master over it why what has raised you above that he won your own efforts that raised you above it well i quit this and i quit that then it's still not right it takes something greater then you're quitting you're struggling you're trying it takes the very life of the lord jesus christ that will raise you into a place of mastering that and ruling over it this is not a reforming word this is a word that holds power within it to bring real deliverance in our life hallelujah you see this is why it's important that when god didn't win your life that the things have been removed out of your life hindrances you say well i i used to drink i don't drink no more that's good but don't stop there why because the bible said when the unclean spirit has gone out not when it's cast out when it goes out it just leaves it gets under the presence and the preaching of the word and here you begin to agree with that word what's happening devils are being removed but remember you need to get that which was once filled now empty it needs to now be filled with the presence of almighty god i'm talking about an abiding in your life to where it's no longer the same old man but now there's a new creation by the spirit of the living god notice therefore as by the offense of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life i love that we weren't even looking for him but he came looking for us just as death i mean you didn't ask for fear to set it in your life you say hey hey i want anxiety hey hey can i have that this isn't a mcdonald's menu it's hard to believe there's things that could be worse than cows not standing up but this right here when you you and i you know what brother ram called it and how can i overcome where we got the human grab bag of life we got things thrown in our satchel that we didn't ask for there's a lot of things that you could try to say oh my i'm not going to be like daddy here and i'm not going to be like mama there and i'm not going to be like grandma there or grandpa there let me tell you something that's part of the tree that you were born in but if you can only recognize there's a greater tree that's here than the woman tree it's called the tree of life brother and when the tree of life comes it gives you a strength over every earthly strain that's there why there's a greater power and authority i i know there might be things back in your past of well my daddy did this or my mama did this or i was abused here or mistreated there but let me have your eyes and let's look away to the lord jesus christ let's look to one that not only brings forgiveness but let's look to the one who brings a deliverance who can wipe out all the bitterness all the lack of forgiveness all the grudges that you hold in your life let's look at the one who can repair your spirit that the enemy wanted to mark and take down and say i'll get their life so twisted up they'll never be able to look anywhere else but he underestimates the power of the trumpet sounding out that your inheritance and the jubilee is on i don't care what the devil has done or how far away it is but when that son of god or daughter of god they hear the trumpet they can rise up and say i'm not going to stay here no longer [Applause] oh the devil said you can't go no long i've had you this way for many years i heard the trumpet i'm not going to argue with you you heard it too see you come on friends why are we doing holding conversations with the devil he don't hold the mystery of your life he tried to twist your life up he tried to put marks on your life young people you hearing me you're trying to get your life so tangled up in things on the internet and everything else he'll try to get you so twisted up and try to mark your life what's he trying to do he's trying to hinder you and trying to stop the purpose that god called you to walk in you say i'm just a young person joshua had young men boaz had young men in the field god is not looking at an age as though you've got to be a certain age to rise to this place what do i have to do you might be a newborn christian in god but if you'll surrender your heart god sometimes will take your life past people that's been sitting in the church for years let me try to come down because my strength is waning as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous we've got different representation hallelujah let me keep on reading here moreover the law entered that the offense might abound but where sin abounded grace did much more abound oh it can look so black and dark but grace abounds greater oh you don't know the situation grace abounds greater are you with me oh brother samuel you don't know how how black it is or how dark and there might have been things that i said that brother samuel i'm so ashamed that i said those things what should i do let grace abound let grace abound because it's abounding if you don't accept it somebody else will you might as well accept god's grace for your life what i have to do to make my life better nothing because you can't oh glory be to god nothing because you can't well instead of drinking five drinks i'll just drink one you're still a sinner well i ain't gonna drink any if you have the desire you're still a sinner preach brother samuel you see because if those are attributes of one thing unbelief it's unbelief in the word of god i'll never forget a man you've heard me tell this story before i was there panera years ago early one morning i was just in there studying him a bible out and you know drinking some coffee and things like that and i was real early when they had opened and i went up there to the the coffee bar or whatever they call it and i went up there and i don't like that old hazelnut stuff but they went up there and you know how it is you ask people uh this fresh coffee yeah i made it a day ago you ain't a coffee drinker i went up there and that person they looked at me and they said oh my i said they said you want some of this hazelnut this gentleman walked up i said no sir i said i don't i said i don't care for that stuff he said well you know what he said i like this stuff he said you know he said i used to drink beer he said but i just changed the rule for this i looked right at him and you know how panera's are set up i looked right at him i said well that's funny i said because i didn't have to quit nothing i said jesus christ came down and took the very desire from my life he stopped filling his coffee cup i'm glad because it ran over and burning he turned around and looked at me right there while people were right there in that place i said yes sir he said what do you mean i said well sir let me just say something to you because he what it was he's one of them guys that don't believe in god i could see his books that he had up there and he began to talk to me and it peaked at that point in time and you see when i began to speak to him just a little bit i said sir what it is i said is that all you've ever known about and it soured you is because you've only saw religion i said but i ain't talking to you about religion i said cause religion i said let me ask you something i said because i think you got enough knowledge about this who was it that crucified the lord jesus i said men that knew the word i said they knew the bible they knew the scriptures i said they crucified it i said why they were blinded it was a religious spirit that crucified the very one that they needed to receive oh he began to fellowship and here he came down right there brother it was just like a canopy sat down right around us and about that time i said sir the god that you've heard about the gods you've always wondered about he's standing right here right now in this place that man got so shook up in the presence of god he left his books left his coffee what'd you do i took him and i ran out to his car said you forgot these oh how i wish he would have just entered in he couldn't deny it it wasn't me it wasn't any vernacular that i had it was god himself you see what it was is my life like your life was simply a stage that he could step on and make himself known brother it wasn't man's words it was the presence of almighty god if that man could have only received it he would not have had to try this or read this anymore his days of trying to satisfy and read this book and read this book his days of self-help would have been over why because the helper was there [Applause] let me tell you he's here this morning he's here this morning hallelujah you see that is sin reigned unto death even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by jesus christ our lord so when we look at this true representation you see we were represented in adam in death but there came one the second adam to represent us in life amen god himself came down to become our representation he came to represent the inheritance that had been taken from the sons and daughters of god let me just try to i'm just going to try to bring this down here right now i know most of you know what that means you see the prophets the spirit of god would come down upon the prophets and they would speak and they would utter forth the living arctic oracles of the word of god it would represent even as moses would stand there and call for flies and other things that were taking place based on the needs in that moment it would recognize that even though here they were under a blood that was a bulls and and goats but they were walking steadfast in the word that god had given them and as they walked in that word the spirit of god would move into their life to where when needs arose they could speak like joshua like others you know they could speak and you see when we when we look at this the spirit of god would come down and you and i could look at that and realize that wait a minute that wasn't the man that opened the red sea that was god i mean it wasn't a man that went up there and brought the walls of jericho down that was god it wasn't a man who stopped the sun it was god in that man's voice that stopped the sun is that right so we're recognizing there are glimpses all along of this of this living inheritance that's to return to the sons and daughters of god you see what are you what are you talking about i'm saying that that inheritance would not be just that where the spirit of god would move down and then it would pull back then it would move down and then it would pull back i'm talking about to where when the spirit of god would be able to set down in and actually take its abode and begin to declare redemption has come you see that's what happened with the lord jesus christ when john's ministry was to was was to declare and announce the messiah now remember the only way he would know who the messiah was he would take the same pillar of fire to come down that john met and identify that this is the lamb of god and it would abide upon him is that what john said he would not come and go and come and go but it would actually abide on him what was that speaking of that was speaking of sons and daughters of god that would actually enter back in to their inheritance we're not coming into the land going out of the land coming into the land going out of the land but brother by one spirit we have been baptized into one body are you with me we're talking about a true living evidence in the word now let me just pause here for a minute it brings it to me you might get cold but don't ever let don't ever let yourself stay in that kind of condition if you're cold what should i do get up next to the fire get some wood on the fire start allowing god that your life would be evaluated what is it that's getting between me and god well brother samuel i feel so defeated why are you feeling so defeated i'll tell you why you're feeling defeated is because you're not abiding in his presence like you ought to be when you abide in his presence this is a privilege that you and i have we're not just church members this message never come to bring us an association of just a few things we can talk around it and be affiliated with that's not what this message is about this message come to sound out to the children of god this is your inheritance and live in this inheritance amen live in it all that god has put in his word is for you and i in this hour he has freely given us all things you say brother sam what are you talking about i'm talking about if your prayer life has got down you need to just you need to just make a real consecration of god and say lord forgive me and start looking at what little things that the devil has tried to put in the way to get between you and your prayer life now remember you're dwelling in this land he ain't gonna put a bottle of whiskey in your way what does he'll do he'll use things that seem very innocent i'm just going to preach now he'll use things that you could look at and you could try to justify well i know so-and-so does this and so-and-so does that but your birth is not based on so-and-so so why are you trying to live your life based on so-and-so you should not be walking according to what i see others do this or i see others do that you don't live your life on that because what if they jump off a bridge what if they end up in hell what's your excuse going to be well lord i just was watching them he said shame on you you should have your eyes on me your eyes is to be on the pillar fire are you hearing me this morning you see you can sit right here in the church you can backslide something right here in the church how can that happen when the word itself is coming forth and you don't apply yourself you don't give yourself to it you don't pray you don't read well brother samuel i still love the lord i'm not calling that in question but i'm asking you are you living in your inheritance or are you just taking up space but i mean what are you saying i'm saying live live when god passed by israel and she was there in the condition of her sin he went by her and said live live live out that life as a son and daughter of god we're not ignorant of satan's devices satan will use anything let me just give you something right here because i happen to be a pastor your pastor you realize that satan would love to get me so busy with cares of the people you all oh brother salmon you're a pastor but a pastor gets so busy brother brown warns every minister over and over in the message he said don't you ever get too busy where you can't pray and hear god's voice listen aren't you interested in fixing people's problems nope nope nope nope brother samuel where's your heart at because i can't fix them we could sit in that office a month or sundays but unless you receive the word and submit your life to the word it'll never do a bit of good and let me just go and drop this god never intended that the pastor would be the personal psychiatrist counselor and everything else he intended that the word would be your counselor the word would be your god he said no i'll never leave you nor forsake you it's true there's times that you have to talk to me as your pastor it's true and don't ever let the enemy tell you well this is a silly old question it'd be better that we sit down and we look at it because that old sleuthing the devil might be trying to tell you something he might be trying to run you down and he's afraid to get in the presence where the word is a living sword and he's uncovered why because now you're not just walking alone as you feel it but the spirit of god has uncovered that devil that's trying to hinder you what will happen to a son and daughter of god they'll unite with that word and say devil you had me thinking this you had me feeling this pretty soon it won't be the pastor calling him a liar you'll be calling him a liar [Applause] [Music] tables turn pretty quick don't they so there's a simple example just simple things of life even things that that is part of my duty and my responsibility there's things that's part of your duty and responsibility i might as well close this there's things that's part of your duty and responsibility as parents i know many you've got children and things like that there's parts and duties that are our responsibility maybe his grandparents or whatever more but never ever should anything a family or whatever more get in the way of god being first in our life satan is subtle he's sly what's he wanting to do he's trying to get us outside of our inheritance what should i do live in the place that god has called you to live in brother i will make this statement in the message influence i'm closing he said you watch he said god will bless a family and brother brahma uses examples of natural things he said they get a better home get a better car he said they're in a better neighborhood he gives all these examples which things would that maybe sometimes people say boy we need better this and we need better that and we need better this and better that and then get into a better place don't just limit it to that but just think of the word better if we get this better and brother that says what happens is he said they start the getting away from the presence of god the brethren said you must always stay where the presence of god is where the presence of god is there to affect and influence your life brother and sister i know that we are called upon to make decisions y'all hearing me i know we got decisions we have to make decisions are made in the mind that's the battleground that's no man's land it's like this right here this aisle right down here this isle is in no man's land it doesn't belong to this side it doesn't belong to that side if somebody wants to walk out of this and go right down here and walk to the bathroom you walk right down through here if somebody wants to come in that way they walk right down through here this does not belong to either side of the church it's a no man's land that's your mind and decisions are made in the mind and the enemy likes to come in with such subtleness he likes to use things and to try to bring snap traps and ensnarement what do i do brother samuel i'd let the word discern it i'd be honest before god and this is what i would do if there are things that that you see that you know are in the way let me just tell you something friends if in a person a person's life say i tell you what i know this is the will of god and they're not praying like they ought to be they're not staying in the word like they ought to be how can you be so sure that that's god's will you're walking on emotions and of feelings we're living in a time where there's things that we ought to be praying about and not just taking things for granted well we can do this and we can do that and we can do this let me just tell you the spirits out there are real you can never underestimate those things what should i do i i'm just admonishing you to live in your inheritance to the fullness if you found that and you're getting cold in your life and look there are times when that happens but don't let that right there be an encouragement to stay cold let it be an encouragement that god in his grace knows about your situation and he's coming to woo you back into a place to be a real effectual son and daughter of god to live in your inheritance where god has called you to live one man represented us in condemnation but there's one standing who has represented us in righteousness there is one who has come to loosen and to set free that we can walk in a liberty let me tell you how powerful this liberty is this liberty that is announced to you and i have sons and daughters of god it declares that no matter what it is you can let it go you can let it go brother samuel i just need for you to say it no you've got authority you say it you say it sickness leave unclean spirits leave it was pornography leave come on now sexual devils leave amen torment in spirit leave fear leave anxiety leave depression leave you see the word is inspiring you you have a voice the word is inspiring you as a son and daughter of god for you to stand there in a place we're not standing we're not standing where adam's representing us there's one who is standing to represent you and i and let me just say this i kind of make the leap back and forth in this hour the lamb is standing the lamb is standing you're representing you and i that we can walk right back into our full inheritance you believe that this morning it doesn't matter what it is it don't matter what habit it don't matter what right now right here this morning you can let it go if there's things that you look back and say i got a little cold let it go just let it go don't it's not wallowing in it let it go let it go and move on with the lord and ask god say lord sharpen my discernment because there's not one person that's here there's not one believer that's here that could say you know well yeah there's been some traps in my life there's been some decisions i wish i'd have made a different decision concerning this every one of us have been there every one of us have been in a state just like joshua was when joshua coming into the land and remember here they come and the gibeonites come and here he finds a situation where he looks at it and all of a sudden these guys come and they say hey we come from a long distance man look at us we got holes in our shoes holes in our garments we got moldy bread and everything is tale and joshua should have checked it with the word but instead he went by feelings right god told him that it's to go to the euro and the priest says in the book of numbers that joshua and elias are the priests with the hero shall divide the land because the land give me this right here because the land itself the holy spirit is divided to you and i by the word because he sends the spirit in his name are you with me the holy ghost a new birth does not come out of does not come outside of the word there is an authority there is that discernment so every every one of us at times we could probably go we could go right through here and say you know what there's been some times where i made a pact with some gibeonites what do i do brother samuel well don't be looking for holy shoes the next time don't be looking for stale bread but brother samuel how am i gonna know it go to the word that you didn't go to the first time remember the word is the filter that god has given us in this hour i don't care how something looks i don't care how it feels it might look right it might feel right but what does the word say about it are you hearing me what does the word say about it it's not what i feel it's not what i think it's not what things seem to be you and i listen my brother and sister discernment by the spirit of god there's things that you and i can look at and until god reveals it because there ain't nobody here a prophet come on now there's things that god did not even show brother branham at time about a person's character or something like that right out from first are you hearing me but you see god in his time this is where everything is to be weighed and balanced by the word i what do you what are you saying i'm saying as parents as grandparents as husbands as wives i'm saying as a church that let everything itself pass through the word if it can't pass through the word with the spirit blessing then i say don't even be a partaker of it can i get an amen on that one lord that's the truth let the word because why god has made you to live in victory you know how it is in your life you know you start maybe you're not eating right or there's things that you start letting go and here and there sometimes just one little thing let me do one little thing right here like let's say somebody's electrolytes gets off man you're in a mess of trouble you know in bad trouble it affects everything effects all kinds of things even the distribution of food and other things in your body and so forth it can get we can get wide open we can get really off but what has to take place there's got to be a replenishment and a continual nourishing of the needed nutrients and brother let me tell you something we are not looking for food in this hour god has provided food let me just give you a little bit of admonition well brother samuel when i come to the house of god i know god ministers to us i know god meets our need but let me encourage you you need to be in the message you need to get in the message of the hour or brother samuel i don't understand it you mean you'd let that devil deprive you i would just renounce that devil i would put on the message and say god give me what i have need of yes are you with me don't act like you're going to a seminary you ain't sitting before a table you don't belong at you're sitting at the table you were born to sit at this table you were made to sit at this table and the god that has furnished the table had your name put in that place the god who has called and revealed this is your place this is your word this is your message that same god is the god who is present to reveal just what you have need of well i can't say it like so and so god ain't interested if you can say it like so and so so-and-so might be saying a lot of things and not living it god's interested in your heart lining up with it and living it amen let's pray oh jesus i wonder if there's one this morning you want to be remembered in prayer god bless you maybe there's one this morning that god's called to you in your life and let you know you're not meant to be a servant you're meant to be a son of god you're meant to be a daughter of god amen god bless you amen let's just invite him he's already here and you just invite him for what you have need of i know that no doubt sitting right here in the building there's lives that i'm going to ask you to take your eyes off of yourself off all your failures i'm going to ask you to take your eyes off brother samuel you don't know this sin that's in my life i don't need to know it but what i'm asking you is if you can look to the lord jesus that there's one who's already made a way to where you go from being reigned over to where you reign over it you say lord i want that reality in my life i want that reality but sam what reality are you talking about i'm talking about the spirit of the living god moving in in the very depths of your life listen whether you're streaming whether you're here no matter where you're at don't just settle for a part way life don't don't just settle for that friends go all the way because a part way life it's never it's not the inheritance but go all the way let god take you all the way into your inheritance to everything that he's placed he's sown and he's desired for your life it'll come forth amen would there be one to say lord take me there take me there and then god bless you it reminds you temptation can come sure temptation is not sin though heeding it is sin not here this morning as the spirit of the lord to just lead us here in the latter part again [Music] say lord i want to draw nine to you lord [Music] lord god i i've drawn a little cold sometimes just decisions not not necessarily things that would be regarded as sin it's just things start getting between you and him oh you're not a sinner you're a believer you're a son and daughter of god living in your inheritance you know you've passed from death unto life but it just feels like your life right now lord something's it just it's not where i want it to be lord jesus i want to draw night to you lord maybe decisions that you've made you say lord i realize there's some decisions that i should have made some better ones lord but i'm owning them lord and i'm asking you lord god not only forgive me but guide me lord help me to be more sensitive knowing that the test will lay before me again help me to be more sensitive god bless your hands god bless you this morning hallelujah lord jesus you see the needs lord that's gathered here this morning you see the lives and hearts of your children lord dear god you always come to minister to our needs i'm so glad lord that [Music] lord we can look in our lives i remember where i was at lord when you called me oh lord i had set in a pew for many years of my life i tried i tried i tried to lay this down tried to lay that down i said i'm not going to let this get me again but lord i was in myself in myself relying on myself i was powerless against it but one day lord god one day lord when in such sovereign grace lord you come not that you didn't come before you did lord i thank you for even all those experiences i really do father but lord jesus to wear my eyes he looked away from myself and he looked to you lord dear god i thank you for that lord because that's the reality lord when we can look away from ourselves and look to the perfect sacrifice i think of when the worshiper would come there lord you never looked at the worshiper you inspected the sacrifice was there any spot blemish or brokenness lameness was there anything wrong with that sacrifice because that sacrifice is what was going to represent the worshiper oh lord jesus heavenly father you became us lord the perfect sacrifice testified i find no fault in him lord jesus blood a perfect blood that was offered to bring about a perfect loosening a perfect freedom lord jesus here this morning whatever that need is lord may the hearts of your children right here this morning may may they be inspired lord [Music] lord to renounce the enemy any hold lord maybe it's it's mind battles may they renounce the enemy lord may they recognize the authority that they have lord that there's a blood that lord god stands to represent us and what we're asking for lord a life that's asking for deliverance that's asking for freedom that's asking for the holy ghost that's asking lord for healing in their body no matter what it is lord there's a blood that's greater than that blood that came by the sexual birth there's a blood that is there to represent that all that we ask for lord god that debt has been settled and we have a choice to accept that lord i pray right now whatever the need is lord may they just confess that lord god may they just confess that lord god may they may they claim that lord god it's the sounding of your voice that gives them authority lord grant lord is your children this morning in the lovely name of the lord jesus christ amen hallelujah if you'd like prayer this morning i'd be happy to pray with you [Music] yesterday [Music] [Applause] [Music] is that yesterday is [Music] been washed by the blood i've been held by the savior i'm filled with [Applause] [Music] return [Music] jesus thank you god and yesterday [Music] foreign [Music] i'm no stranger to the prisons shackles and chains [Music] oh i'm not going back i'll never be [Music] [Music] is oh thank god [Music] our eyes are looking away from ourselves is looking unto the lord jesus he's the one that's standing there to represent he's the one that's standing there there is no defeat in him it's only victory there's glory amen that's where that's where real authority lies it's right there i tell you we've got authority by the blood of the lord jesus christ the spirit of god has come to quicken make it alive to us amen no matter no matter what you face no matter what opposition lays before you god has commissioned you to go to the other side amen there's strength there's authority there's a true representation for you and i amen even over your family there's a true representation that's there but something you don't know the condition they're in some of us are in some pretty bad conditions sometimes sometimes you can be in a pretty bad condition just sitting in a church amen because in that kind of a situation you don't even know you're wrong is that right sometimes out there people at least know they're wrong but to think of what the grace of god did it put it in a place to where you and i can stand and we can pray and we can even speak and say satan take your hands off of them amen brother samuel what good is that going to do try it and find out there's an authority that you and i have because there is a blood that speaks better things an authority that god has given to you and i when they could come back into that place of their land [Music] brother aaron nobody could take that land there might have been somebody who came on that land for a little bit and said i'm going to take that little squat that little part right there when they came back into their inheritance get out well can i just have that little corner no get out i i won't do no harm get out no peace treaties no packs no covenant why are you saying that because i plan on filling the borders [Music] to the full potential for what he has anointed for my life to live out i plan on living and devil there ain't enough room for you and me there ain't enough room for you and jesus [Music] you were over the influence of my life before i don't got no time for you amen oh glory he might try to come in on a corner of your land and just because you're not maybe at that corner he'll try to sneak in but you know what as soon as you recognize he's right here in this corner of the land what do i do serve eviction notice you've come in here and wanted to try to take my peace you wanted to try to disturb me you wanted to try to come and take my health but you're on god-given ground this is my ground as a believer and i assure you in the name of the lord jesus christ get out of here [Music] what is he doing you are speaking by authority on the land that's been given to you you have a voice i said you have a voice oh my your voice might seem small and dainty but it's not the the vernacular whatever of your voice it's the roar of the lion sounding within your voice amen the lion hath roared amen oh my let's just stand let's let's just worship him just a few moments amen he certainly deserves more than that but let's just let's just in fact let's just let the war the word be watered in our life just let it be watered in in our life right now sing that sing it again sing that verse again [Music] shackles and chains thank you lord i'll never believe this [Music] [Applause] hallelujah [Music] [Music] is my sins are forgiven [Music] what can wash away [Music] [Applause] [Music] nothing but the blood of jesus [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] nothing but the blood [Music] yes [Music] oh [Music] the blood of jesus this is [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] this next verse says now by this i'll overcome the god that lives inside of you glory has already overcome it amen no matter what opposition no matter what comes the god who lives inside of you is greater mightier stronger he's already overcome it amen he over he overcome it when he walked here in the veil of his flesh and that same god is overcoming in the veil of your flesh amen he's been working and he's moving and yeah sometimes you know like a boat will go down the go down you know like a little uh you know a little river or whatever more sometimes it can get hung up in some stuff is that right there might be some stuff that gets gets hung up or a little snag but you see there's something more than just wood there's a power behind your life if something gets a little hung up you you got some power you got engine power you got holy ghost power amen that that's present now all you got to do is just it'll break and you're able to pull right out of that why because greater is he that is in you and now by this i'll overcome nothing but the blood of trees [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] amen let's just bow our heads heavenly father lord as we your god just be dismissed lord from the presence of one another lord the lord never from your presence i pray heavenly father that god is your word lord has went forth lord to speak to our hearts i pray that god that as we leave from this place lord that god we walk out of here as better christians lord more of a determination in our life lord where no matter how we walked in here we're not walking out the same we're walking out lord with a courage a refreshing a feeling a refilling oh god help us lord help us each and every one that dear god if there be one outside of their inheritance lord i pray that god may they not rest lord until they come into that place may their eyes be removed from off all of their own thoughts and be centered upon you lord granted lord and i pray dear god for those of us lord dwelling in our inheritance may we occupy every border lord as paul would say give no place to the devil lord perhaps maybe there's some strongholds that's come in maybe certain feelings or certain things that's come into that lord that to recognize this is not part of my inheritance i don't have to allow this to remain we can pull down strongholds lord i pray father may the spirit of god lord as we feed on this word and this word lord there's a growth and a growing that's taking place lord in our life dear god we want to live all that you have desired and called for us to live we know we can't do it on our own it's it's not even in our efforts it's not in any of our pushings or no it's in yielding lord it's yielding and accepting of what you've already done for us lord to claim it lord to take it as our possession as paul could say i seek to be i seek to apprehend that which i'm apprehended of paul knew lord god of these things that had been delivered to him but paul was as an honest son of god that could say i count not myself to be perfect but i press towards the mark paul recognized that until the last breath that i take in this mortal body i am going to occupy i'm going to keep reaching ahead i'm going to occupy every part of the inheritance that was given to me that word that god has given to us in this generation i'm going to live out that word by the help and guidance and direction and leadership of the holy spirit i'm just going to submit myself the lord you can reveal and express yourself through my life lord granted lord i pray watch over your children lord as we go our separate ways be with them lord i pray may you just continue to minister him lord even as we leave this place lord but a stand that's been made a declaration lord even while the words being ministered that they've they make that stand in their heart god may they just continue to stand on that word lord and watch it come to pass watch you bring it to pass in your life granted father we pray be with each and every one lord in the name of jesus christ amen amen once again this coming thursday brother
