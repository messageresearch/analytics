my time with you something's always trying take it away oh what would I do oh what would I do if I didn't have my time with you [Music] if I didn't have my time with [Music] you how many know that's the truth amen that's that's the stabilizer of Our Lives and the fellowship with him and what that means to us and you know it's something in your life and our lives you can tell if if there's just something a little missing and you just look and say Lord I just need a moment Lord I just need a moment Lord I just need some time you know sometimes with the the cares of life we can have the best the best plans of what we have May maybe in your time when you do your devotions of a morning or whenever you do your devotions then things will arise that it just doesn't happen that morning but you know I'm thankful that within that we always have to guard against it because it can start to become a string but we can always move back to it and realize that all it takes is just a moment whether you're sitting you're driving and say Lord am I want to invite you into this into this moment I desire your daily bread Lord I I need you Lord Lord lead me not into temptation Deliver Me From Evil amen we we always have that that privilege and you know it's just something about talking to him it Comforts us it Comforts us you know brother brand said it like this he said Jesus stayed in contact with his father through prayer and that's how we stay in contact with him amen amen you love him this evening and so good to be in the house of the Lord and good to be gathered together if you'd like to stand with us and I want to go back in here to pick up on on job and um looking at this thought we've been U dealing with on where the worrying and where job had come to in this with fear and I think I have just a couple uh maybe another place after this this service but we'll see but I want to uh look at this here just a little bit I I so enjoyed you know I enjoyed the the messages on hope I I so I will ask you to forgive me if I got a little beside myself but uh I really enjoyed those messages uh what the Lord give us you know I CU I I don't give them you know it's like brother brandham when he says they were uh the Collins they were looking at uh uh brother uh Neville and he was serving food in the Tabernacle and they got a little bit question what's he doing Serving food in the Tabernacle and brother brah said well what that is he said that was a was he brother Neville is preaching the same message that I preach and so this this food that we have is a perfect food to bring forth A Perfect Bride amen and I I'm just thankful God gives to us just what we have need of it and uh amen so I know when when I have a somebody that's waiting on me I don't want them sticking their finger in my plate and and tasting it but but I'll tell you here when we're talking about the word of God I want to eat with you amen I want to be a real partaker amen so in Job chapter 3 and verse 24 he said for my my sighing cometh before I eat and my roarings are poured out like the waters for the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me and that which I was afraid of is come unto me I was not in safety neither had I rest neither was I quiet yet trouble came so I'd just like to ask the Lord to help us once again in looking at this thought on overcoming coming fear and its effects and let's just bow our heads and let's just ask him that he'll just come and the author of the book and just speak to our hearts for what we have need of heavenly father Lord everything Lord is is spoken Lord in your word that you make all things beautiful in your time and how that Lord the writer would Lord write under inspiration and just to be able to declare that there there is a time for everything Lord and father to know that God that you're mindful of every season of life you're mindful of everything that we are facing and those things Lord that we lord would would go through Lord from the seasons of life to Lord changing Lord uh uh circumstances around us but father you're the one that stays constant Lord through it all as you said Lord through Malachi I'm God and I change not and Lord as you manifested it over and over in this generation and you still are manifesting yourself to be the same yesterday today and forever Lord that gives us a real strength and a real Comfort Lord that no matter what it is that we're facing you are the strength of our life Lord and you're the same one Lord that has brought us safely this far you'll take us Lord the rest of the way home so Lord we're looking to you father oh God once again this evening that you would just have your way in our midst Lord and come Lord and speak to our hearts Lord minister to us Lord I Lord have that which is laying before me Lord that we've studyed Lord and you would drop in our hearts Lord but father it takes you Lord to come and to breathe upon this word Lord and bring it to our lives Lord and just to guide us Lord in the things Lord that need to be said and to be spoken tonight and give us Lord the grace Lord I pray to receive it Lord and may we walk out of here Lord a different people than what we walked in Lord we love you and we thank you now father in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you as you're being seated amen I just want you to I would also covet your prayers we're uh I'll be here on Sunday and then right after that service I think some of our boys are going to head out to uh byc there on Saturday but then we'll go down on Sunday after service here uh for uh those those meetings there and I have some Services there to to minister to the young people and um I just really I I covet your prayers and um I think we're really living in a in a real moment in a real time and uh I think Satan he really he not only he's after each one he's after after young people and all alike and there's ways that Satan would even try to take things and want to bring confusion among the young people but I know the word's a a stabilizer and the word of God is our absolute to give us a real anchor and a hold a real experience a real Direction in our lives and and God knows of all the needs that would be uh gathered there you know there's a lot that when I was thinking about it today there's a lot goes through your heart uh even when you not only within those meetings but in other meetings and I look at and you know you just have such a a ride a wide array of of thoughts that come through uh for knowing that there will be so many different needs that are there but my prayer is God that you'll take every every counselor every Minister every individual that's there and Lord just come through there and minister to every single need and so we just I just ask that you would just join with us in prayer that the Lord will just have his way here in these in these services I want to in looking at this with overcoming fear and and its effect I've been drawing upon this from uh we've been drawing upon that from out of the message of perfect faith and I didn't put that quote up for you tonight but just where the Prophet is speaking of how that we understand that there are things that can come in our life just as much as he would say it in this way there's very key uh statements that he'll say even in perfect faith and he'll say the statement that the reason that that Faith came to the Lord Jesus was because he was the word and he would say when when you receive the word you become the word he would also speak to us and say you've got to be in that position in order for that Faith to come now we recognize that when that the faith of the Son of God or that faith that jod would write that we were to earnestly contend for we know that that Faith itself is God's Own Faith that's God's own life that's when where by the Holy Spirit our lives have been transformed and there now is a real Supernatural super sense of God's Own Faith living and moving in our life and then we realize that as we approach so many different things we are having a faith and God's desire is that we would have such a faith within his word and to just stand upon his word and then as we're standing there and in position then when it comes that there is a need that arises and when God would need or would would need or would come to drop something in our life then we are available as a channel to where that faith can drop for whatever need that we have and so sometimes you know cretion is certainly something that should always be a part of our life we Satan wants to constantly want to try to take us away from consecration but that's the real strength of a Believer is a consecrated life and a consecrated walk with God the Bible says regarding Enoch that before he was translated he had this testimony that he pleased God so it was a consecrated life and this is something that it brings us and puts us into position for those things that even when God would drop down into our life and things would come such as let's say you have need of of healing in your body you know the doctors and everything else that they've they've done and uh that can be done but yet as you're taking a hold and you've been holding on God's promise that by his stripes I'm Healed I'm the Lord that Health all thine diseases and you're just taking hold upon every one of those promises and as a Believer you should do that that's a faith that will say that I know God and I know him who made the promise and this is why that I'm holding on to that promise now we don't know exactly as we're standing there I don't know if it's going to come what way it's going to come I don't know the next moment I don't know but all that God would require of me and you is to stand with the faith in his word then we become a channel that's available for God to move through and job was a channel remember he was a Channel of inspiration for God to move through but because he wasn't receiving any inspiration from God that's where he got to worrying the prophet said when you get to in that that kind of a fix that's when Satan moves in to all of your friends he'll move into everyone around and then it starts to become accusing why here that worrying opens up and and then fear itself sets in and when fear sets in that's a bad situation brother Ram said if you had cancer I read this quote to you before if you had cancer but didn't fear it you would be in a really good shape he said but if you have fear well he said that's that's in a real bad shape because fear itself is torment now there's a difference between the fear of the Lord and the fear that Satan would bring there's a the fear of God is clean the Bible says it's a reverence to the things of God As a matter of fact without having a real fear of God you can never please God but this fear is a fear that came because of the fall and even as we would walk here in this realm and in these bodies we will have to battle it and resist it and overcome it and there's only one way we're going to be able to overcome it and that's by the word of God in our lives it's just like this we are commissioned to cast Satan out that's good that's what we're commission to do and the prophet when he takes this this scripture here in job uh the that we just read here where job said the thing which I greatly feared has come upon me and that which I was afraid of has come unto me he goes into this of how that this this fear he says it was this fear that actually brought the condition about in job's life his fear is what brought it to him he was scared it was going to happen and he says you know if you're afraid when you come in the prayer line it's not going to happen I'm not going to receive anything I'm not going to get anything then he says it won't now this to me is where's a this is a great Paradox when I look at this here was job a man that had such a hold on God and you know I'm using the prophet's words such a hold on God and he had a hold on God by divine revelation and yet this this fear that had come in and what job actually greatly feared it happened to him but you know that that in itself did not diminish one iota that he was a Son of God that's right it did not take away that that faith of that reality of what God had given to him because job still stood when the accusers come and stood and said I know where I'm standing on God's word he was job did not have a make believe Faith you know where we're looking at something other than the word of God his life was examined by the word and that's what gave job the strength to stand when his accusers were all around and you know like as one writer said it you had guys there that were actually automatc that would do surgery on I and trying to perform heart surgery on job in other words they had a lot of word but it was the wrong application and why was it being applied wrongly cuz they didn't know God the way job knew God that's what makes the difference that's why the token makes a difference the token raises the word of God and brings forth in your life as a believer that every word is yay and amen in him Hallelujah that is so good so fear itself faith is a substance fear is a substance it is torment right faith faith itself it produces a joy is that right fear fear being a substance it produces torment worry weary right dread fear itself can cause cause lives to avoid certain situations that's right so it's a real it's a real thing but I want to I I don't want to elevate fear I want to see I want you to see tonight we're here to elevate the almighty God these are things that we are are faced with like job was but God gives us Grace to live with a real strength and a fortitude in this hour I want to read here from Isaiah 12 and verse 1 and as we're reading from here I want you to think of how that you know even when a doctor is going to give you medicine the first thing that he tries to get you to do is get you to have confidence in that medicine and that's exactly because it's it's faith that does the healing and so God's desire be the word let me just say it like this the word is sufficient to the challenge that you face and God's Desire with his presence coming his word listen God could say what he needs to say even here tonight he could say it in one sentence but God takes through a whole part where you know here we are studying and laboring and praying and God will take through a wholeness of service to work to bring you and I to a faith to where our faith is increased in him not in a man in him amen are you hearing me that's good so notice I love this here this is even speaking of Israel's restoration but I want to draw for some places here in verse one in that day Thou shalt say oh Lord I will praise thee though thou was angry with me thine anger is turned away and thou comforest me praise the Lord that's so good why because the sin debt has been satisfied let me tell you something tonight you're not dealing with an Angry God hallelujah it's not God's anger or wrath that's bringing conviction it is the love of God that brings conviction because conviction leads you to the place of acceptance and righteousness in him that's why the prophet said I used to think that God was angry with me but Jesus loved me then I come to find out they're the same person see what a confession now in verse one is's no longer I'm no longer under the wrath of God I'm under the safety of God I'm abiding under his word his word has found me out his word has brought it to the reality the debt has been settled I know who I am as a Believer and it's settled that's the testimony verse two behold God is my salvation praise the Lord amen let me tell you he's your salvation even today when you needed saving from thoughts that were going through your mind he was your salvation when situations arose this week he was your salvation he is not was he is is my salvation that's so good I will trust and not be afraid for the Lord Jehovah is my strength and my song You may notice how that phrase is put together in the scriptures even when they come across the Red Sea and different places my strength and my song He's The Melody of my life you know the Bible tells us in the book of Colossians it tells us that how that the peace of God Is To Rule and reign in our life and it tells us in Colossians and Ephesians that making melody in our hearts singing Psalms and hymns let the word of God dwell in you richly there's a lot of things we can have dwell in our minds and going over in our minds you know how it is you from songs that God's delivered you from even from certain places you've been and all of a sudden you can just start hear in that tune and certain things will start coming back to you stanzas of that song what they'll sing next that's in the gate of memory in your spirit not your soul in your spirit but God has a way that when he'll come by and begin to move through his word and begin to sing over your life and begin to pulsate through your life it will take you from that condition and where you're at and bring you into that place to where I know that my redeemer liveth my he also is become my salvation now watch this in verse three therefore with joy shall you draw water out of the wells of Salvation many Wells but one salvation he is all things to us he has become all things all the Redemptive names of Jehovah are summed up and tied up in Jesus Christ he is my salvation amen there are rivers of Living Water is that right but is's one living water many rivers not many ways he alone is the way but he is all things to me now I want you to think of this here very carefully that when we're looking and approaching for things that we could see and be before us in our life things that we come up against things that we will face and you know God God knows just what to bring us to and when to bring it when to bring us to it he knows just when he's God's not in the business of overwhelming us to where we would pull back and just throw up our hands God brings us to the place where he is coming to uh where you and I come to a place to overcome in certain places in our life just like when he led them out of Egypt he didn't take them that certain way which would have been much closer he didn't do it they weren't ready for battle he took him through the Red Sea why did God take him through the Red Sea he want wanted to take a circumstance that looked impossible how do you get across this water when s when they are behind my back how do you do that God was doing that to teach them something that when you do come into battle I'm a way maker when something when the enemy us hot breath is hot on your Trail I'm a way maker keep walking our way make a way speak the word and go forward God was teaching teaching them yes along the way yes sir now in the so as God brings us to the places that we need to be brought to there's times that in our lives that we come into uh the situations and we everything sometimes it'll begin with a right mental attitude toward the promise of God that's where it always should begin you know F we've got after whatever news or whatever's come up we we got to come back around to a place to what God has said and God's word is true that's where we that's where everything has to start building this is our hope is in the Lord now notice and brother Bram says this I want you to listen this and as the eagle stir at his nest brother Bram says if any persons will take the right uh attitude uh towards any Divine promise that God has made it'll bring it to pass if you could take the right attitude towards what he said it'll bring bring it to pass no just the right attitude I've been I've seen sarom cancer leave people by the same thing wow the right mental attitude now remember it's not your mind or my mind that's doing it it's not mind over matter it's the word that we're taking in you got to be careful what we're taking in I mean we're living in a day and age you don't even have to go home to look up oh I got an ache here and I got a crook here and I got a let's see what my smart phone says right is that right but sometimes I understand we can we can look things up but if we're not careful friends sometimes the things that we'll start reading and looking at then it's just like there sets in upon us oh my I and I'm not talking about ignoring things I'm not talking about pretending that things aren't there but I'm just saying that there is such about and around us of things to where fear itself can come in through many different avenues like like this you're getting ready to fly somewhere and somebody comes up to you and says hey do you see that you see what happened just a little bit ago that plane dropped 27,000 ft right in the air just like that you got a choice whether you're going to accept that or not you understand there's things that'll come that way that you don't have no control over but you this is where you've got to know I know where God has called me to you got to know that the footsteps of the righteous are order of the Lord I'm trusting in the Lord yes brother R says maybe you won't be able to receive enough to deliver you all of a sudden listen very closely but he says if you can't receive enough Faith to be healed instantly then take the adopted baby route he said did you ever hear of the adopted baby now brother br will talk about this many places in the message but he says if you take a young woman she'll maybe be married she and her husband and she's scared she isn't going to have a baby she wants one and she's so scared she won't have it she won't because just like job said notice he's putting the scriptural principle what is it that's regulating it why that that woman will not become with child it's the principle because like job said the things that I feared the most come upon me that's why I don't think you should ever speak things out well I'm afraid this will happen I'm afraid this will happen I tell you what you might as well go ahead and open your mailbox it's coming don't don't speak those things well I tell you when is all this going to end when is all this don't don't welcome it in don't welcome it in don't welcome it in the fear itself if fear this is what brought this to job now the prophet is helping us to see this even in a contrast setting of where there's fear where she won't be able to have a baby where did this fear come from I don't know there's many different ways that fear could have come there could have been many experiences down through life maybe certain things that she's been told certain things that she's experienced I don't know maybe things that's come down through in their family but at any rate Satan is an opport tunist wherever that he can slip fear in he'll do it that's right notice he says but if the doctors you know probably there's nurses setting here he says you take that same woman and let her adopt a baby then she'll have one herself it quietens her now I tell you what if this what if this little lady says no I don't want to adopt a baby I don't want to adopt it I don't want to do it then there's probably she she may never be delivered of that fear but if she will adopt a baby what does it do the adopted baby begins to set her in the right emotion it begins to open those channels as her Focus are you hearing me her focus is off of her fear and her Focus becomes on the product and as their focus begins to happen then there's changes that are happening in her that allow her to open in order to receive I I'll read some things medically here in just a minute notice if you haven't got enough Faith to receive it right now as a miracle then take the adopted baby attitude I'll just go ahead and say it Lord I'm not too big to take the adopted baby I'm not too big however you want to do it Lord however it's going but I'm going to tell you this right here when situation I'm going to take God's promise and God's word because God's word is always right yes I'm the one who's wrong notice here's how you take that attitude lord it's mine because you promised it I'll go from here tonight praising you just the same as I was well watch what happens you'll receive it it has to happen God promised it hallelujah oh Hallelujah watch this if you can just feel just a least little speck of faith not a great big but a least little speck of faith that tells you you'll be all right you believe it and just go on thanking him for it oh watch this application notice he says they hadn't received the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost they were 10 days up there thanking the lord praising him for the promise of the Holy Ghost and all of a sudden it came like a Russian Mighty wi you believe it with all your heart [Music] hallelujah amen I'll take the adopted baby route Hall you know why it takes your focus off of you and your abilities or inabilities and it puts our focus into the god upon God who brings forth life do you realize that's why the preaching of the word is when you come and sit here this is not you deciding what tapee you're going to listen to this is not you deciding what quote or what scripture it's God coming on the scene and he's putting your focus on the word where it needs to be for your life that's why the prophet said the preaching of the word is to put our mind on Calvary Hallelujah that is so good it doesn't matter brother B goes on he says person in a wheelchair person with answer he says it doesn't matter heart trouble tubercular if the doctor has given up on you don't lose courage God is still on the throne that is so good yes sir oh my brother B says that in another place he said she's afraid she's not going to have a baby she won't have it but you let her adopt it and she'll have one he said the books claim nine out of 10 will do that and some of you I know you listen to a and my wife does we have we've had to listen to the Collins were family I I like them um but uh you know she here you you some of you that that that follow them in their and their music you you know the one is it is it Courtney Courtney her and her husband they were over in Thailand and went to adopt a baby during covid times and here they were stuck in the hotel had to quarantine for so long and everything else and do all of this well it wasn't but a short bit of time after they adopted that baby she had one I couldn't help but when I look at that I thought this exactly what brother bram's talking about so I I I I do enjoy their music I we just kind I kind of pick on my wife a little bit me and the boys you know but I really do enjoy enjoy them but I think they have some real inspired songs and I really enjoyed them but notice within this I I say it in that way that you can see these things that happens it says what brother B says it sets her body into the right emotion it puts her in the right attitude you know they've actually studies where they've done that will say that you know but that stress alone it'll say stress alone when they you know doctors have looked at this that stress alone cannot cause infertility but stress will interfere with a woman's ability to get pregnant it talks about how all of these things there was one a doctor had done one particular thing looking at fear and its effects on the body and how that there was a woman that actually had a fear of pain during pregnancy now she wasn't pregnant but she had a fear of pain from being pregnant and that fear because of coming into the the pregnancy and the and the delivery that fear actually closed her Fallopian tubes wow the doctor that was studying and looking at all of this they looked at they knew infection injury can cause those things to close but it I I never seen it like this but it was actually he says now we know that even emotional crisis and shock can close these tubes just as it will make one clench its fist let me tell you if that will happen that way when it comes to Natural conception what do you think the enemy would try to do when it would come to spiritual conception he would like to try to put such a stress and such attenion he'll try to also distract you he'll try to run you down he'll say it's not for you he'll put all of those things to try to do what get you in a place to where you're so tense but you cannot receive when you're tense But realize that the God who is speaking to you knows all about you it is God that will bring it to pass let me just say it to you don't ever you're not God is not a God that puts you under pressure to receive something this moment do this or do that God does not do that he presence brings us to yield because remember your experience is out of Satan's Eden your experience is predestinated from the hand of God brother Bram said the Holy Ghost is not schooled into you am Hallelujah but this this sh this This Woman's fear her deep fear of pain what it was they begin to find out it was her deep fear of pain that was associated with childbirth and these watch this these fears and images were placed in her when she was a child she's living under the effects of things that took place when she was a child now who put these images was it was it mom was it people sitting around was it things you know s and I you know I mean sometimes you almost you know in one way you feel sorry for you know young sisters they get around and talking other I tell you what man I would never you almost want to say let's leave God bless you we'll see you at church remind me to fellowship with you from a distance you understand what I'm saying you know I'm not saying that we're not you know to to be ignorant of things but I I think also sometimes it's things that we're we're also tested cuz we can't keep everything in a bubble to where it's all going to happen you know all of a sudden we rock up can you imagine husband walking up to his wife cuing her ears and saying come on let's go honey what are you doing so there's things that we we cannot close out it's going to be there we're going to be tested but God gives us Grace to overcome notice these spheres and images were placed in her as a child and how that even her reproductive system had actually come to a place to reacting to the fear and that power upon the mind you know what brother Ram's wife sister mey remember that when after um uh uh Rebecca had come the doctors had told him don't try to have no more children but God spoke to the prophet's heart when he was up there praying for a meeting he said oh God I'd like to have I'd love to have you know a son like Joseph I would name him Joseph so they have a baby here comes a baby but it ain't Joseph it's Sarah right right now when God had dropped that into the prophet's heart the prophet didn't say well I guess I got it wrong you know I mean it it must have been Sarah but he you see this is what I'm trying to tell you this was not when brother Brown prayed that way and God dropped that in his heart that wasn't brother brandom pushing himself out into something see that that's not Faith but faith when that when that perfect faith has come when that faith that substance for for that particular situ God dropped that it wasn't anything brother brandham created or brother brandham brought it down God had him read in the Bible he's reading in the Bible how many times his brother Brown and read on Joseph but in that moment inspiration struck him and his request and here comes Sarah remember how the nurses made fun say oh you must have mean Josephine but here was here was Sister brandom Sister meting brother R describes this of how that when here she was expecting and this is the time that you know it was Joseph and I they didn't know they didn't have all those things back then you know I guess to know and what whatever what whatever the gender of the baby was but you know four years had passed since that and his wife you know brother BR says we were real tore up and everything you know she was sick and nervous and brother Bram talks about how the the the lady who had been there to help deliver every one of the children uh you know and she was one that actually had been healed in a meeting of cancer and was actually on the list for somebody dying from cancer but God had healed her but she wasn't able to be there she'd been there all the other times but she wasn't able to be there because she was out of town her name was Sister Margie and so you know some things when things just aren't you know just we what we call normal this person's there this person's here and this and oh then brother Brown said then you had this he said where a lady was coming through and he said this woman was coming through and she'd made a statement that I needed to listen to her God was telling her to tell me something and if I didn't do this God was going to take the airplane out of the sky that I was riding on he said but it never happened he said I was out on a on a hiking trip and she said you know when I was out hunting trip he said when I you know I was going to be out there and going to fall off the mountain and and break my arm and Hunters would be out looking for me but he said was no word of it so but he said then when she couldn't get my attention that way she went up and she she sent word to my wife and said because your husband will not listen to me God's going to kill you during this child birth and brother Bram says it like this he says and it got to the poor little fellow it got to Sister mey here she is right she's the prophet's wife not just the prophet's friend right see fear doesn't look upon the door and say oh this is the prophet of the hour oh you're a believer in Malachi 4 fear doesn't look at it that way but here is a situation where her emotions and things are so tender and something that would you would look at how in the world could she even entertain that but you see sometimes the way the emotions and how that can be all set up and tensed within that moment in that time and it got her all worked up to the ram said he went out to the cave he began to pray and as he went out to pray he said he said the Lord told me go back to your car and you're going to find your Bible open and I want you to read where your Bible is open brother Bram said I got back to the car he said I looked he said and the Bible was open to where Nath had told David do all that's in your heart for I'm with you brother Bram said I left out of there he said I was weeping I was crying on my way home he said I got out of the car I put my arm around her and said it's going to be all right he said and that settled it Hallelujah fear came but God was the answer to cast that fear out and this is why that when we look at I want you just to think on in in these aspects of it in Deuteronomy chapter 2 when God would speak to Israel they're getting ready to come into the land and I want you to notice how how crucial it is that God would speak to Israel when they're coming into the L and he would remind them not only of what belongs to them but God lets them know that hey there's other Giants and I have taken down those other Giants for these other nations let me read it to you when the Bible says here in verse 29 or verse 19 of Deuteronomy 2 when thou comest nigh over against the children of Amon distress them not nor medal with them for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Amon any possession because I have given it unto the children of lot for a possession that was also accounted a land of giants Giants dwelt therein in Old Time and the ammonites called them zumans a people great and many and tall as the Anakin but the Lord destroyed them before them and they succeeded them and dwelt in their stad look the ammonites were not even the children of the promise right and they had Giants and God wiped them Giants out listen friends we're not the only place the bride is not the only one who experiences healings and miracles and signs and wonders that's why that healings miracles signs and wonders that's not the bride's Revival the bride's Revival is the word living inside of a people and yes miracle and and signs will follow them that believe Hallelujah but notice this has been they've been disinherited and these Giants these isum are just like the anakims verse 22 as he did to the children of Israel which dwelt in sire when he destroyed the horms before them they succeeded them and dwelt in their stad even unto this day and the aens which dwelt in hazam and even unto asah the the cims that came forth out of capter destroyed them and dwelt in their stead so no all of these other Giants that have been destroyed the anakims were not the only Giants but there had been people who were not even the children of God but they themselves had received enough Faith to take what possession God was going to give them is that right this is so here God what's why is God doing this he's letting them know I'm the same God for you what I've opened and I've showed you I'm the God to bring it to pass just as I have through them you see fear dominated that previous generation fear dominated him fear was greater than the love of God because God's love brings confidence is that right this is why when you look at the scriptures the scriptures called them men of War they were Men of War that was not occupied with the love of God there was fighting among them come on friends fighting among them putting down and cutting out and all of that stuff but this is why the love of God was not having preeminence right let me tell you the love of God is not some basic thing right the love of God is the Capstone is that right is God's sitting down upon his church am this is why well we could preach on that on the men of War there for a little bit but you see when it God God is not in the business of tearing down are you hearing me tearing one another down God is not in the business of that but notice we we may God help us to see the value of living in the atmosphere of divine love and choosing to bring every thought subject to The Obedience just like the prophet did when it came to the Hornets the maniac and the bull brother brand would say it like this he would tell us if you're the least Speck angry on the platform might as well walk off at least little speck angry don't don't approach that don't don't approach him don't talk about it just walk away and brother BR say like this you pray until you feel different in your heart and I love how he finishes that quote he said trust me I know what I'm talking about amen yes sir this is why the scripture said there is no fear 1 John 4:18 in love but perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love right now that fear that God comes to settle that fear and bring a settling in our heart by the holy spirit that we know that our spirit beareth witness with his spirit that we are the children of God in other words my soul says Amen to every word of God when I walk the the Lotus when Aaron would walk it was bells and pomegranates when I walk my walk is an amen to the word of God not just when I'm in church when I'm outside of church it's a life that is in harmony with God because why it is his love that has come to me his love that has done a work in my life and I have received that love that love that I did not deserve that love that overrode every doubt that love that came and it moved in my life and what was it it caused me to repent of my sins it cost me to lay my life down and that love moved in little by little until eventually that love took its rightful position and my life is ruled and rained by the love of God I do only those things that's pleasing to him if I've done something that's off the love of God corrects me and my desire is to come in line with his word amen hallelujah and you see that keeps us in a position for perfect Faith this is why I like how brother BR would say these things over and over regarding the bull The Hornet and the maniac he would say it like this in the message love and regarding that of the bull and the and those things he said it was love little phrase I'm going to read here it was love that took the fear away and God seen me through did you hear it was love that took the fear away fear was there but fear can't stand in the presence of divine love fear had to back up is that right Amen in another place brother random talking about when that you know those Hornets came in the message love 1956 he says when th those Hornets had covered him over he said instead of being scared love come in and took its place now where did that love come from that love was already there but it was surrendering to the love of God that was in his heart it was the love of God coming in and coming forth it was invited the love of God was invited into the situation do you realize this is why the prophet would say this over and over through the message oh I wish I could live in that atmosphere all the time oh I wish I could walk in that atmosphere all the time because I love you you know how it comes in I've been in situations where my is such disagreement and I've just sensed his presence come right down and my it's everything is under control not my control but the control of divine love and it's such a peace it's such a rest that's what the prophet was talking about love came in and fear was gone amen let me just say this to you and to understand when we look at this sometimes we have to come back to these places to understand brother brandham lived a consecrated life are you hearing me now listen God's not called you nor me to do what brother Bram did that was the office God called him to do right but God's called us to be consecrated as Believers and as we remember Jude said keep yourselves in the love of God is that right so staying in that place to where love there's a place where Love Can can come on the scene fear can be done away because you know what fear would have caused fear would have caused brother Braham to do when he was thinking those thoughts in that Maniac he sized him up right right he was a boxer sized him up what was doing that fear right but he said I chose to think different thoughts and the kind of thoughts he started to look at is no doubt he said this is a good this is a good man he don't want to be this way no doubt he's got a family at home notice he starts entering in he starts interceding that man did not deserve if we'll look at it in what's being deserved he didn't deserve interceding but you see what was it it was the spirit of Christ that was having the right away to intercede for that man and it overcame Hallelujah that devil not the man the devil cuz remember remember when he fell across brother bram's feet the holy spirit said because you've accepted because you've challenged the Holy Spirit you'll fall across my feet the Holy Ghost feet that night was brother brandom's and remember when those out there there were in CS there were many that were sick and they were bound and and all kinds of afflictions and the prophet said when that happened they got up off the cops got out of the wheelchairs sickness left cuz they saw their Chief demon Was Defeated Hall it took the strength right out of them my thank you Lord so here we find it this is why David would say in Psalms 56:3 what time I am afraid I will trust in thee in God I will praise His word in God I have put my trust I will not fear what flesh can do unto me that's so good Hallelujah this is why then when we look at it and understanding fear one of the studies that was done to me I I look at these things I read it I think my goodness these are things that's happened down through the scriptures and it it says it like this just just bear with me it just one of the things it is one of fear sneakiest tricks is convincing us that the realm of possibility is more limited than what it really is that's good you remember the spies we're not able the realm of possibility was so limited but oh you let God take a hold of it and you look at like David David here is staring this big giant and David's look at him the rest of the Army's trembling in fear and David looks at him and says how can you miss him amen fear Faith finds things that fear will never ever see but faith will let you see the enemies a vulnerability the in his armor it'll let you see look the rest of them nobody else ever said he's an uncircumcised Philistine that's the first thing David called out and said who is this uncircumcised Philistine he realized I got a covenant with a covenant keeping God I know God by an experience this guy does not have a covenant Hallelujah the possibilities where the rest of them said how in the world can we overcome this David said how can we God is on our side this is the shortest guy in the bunch right no doubt David's wearing osers out there to the battle shortest guy in the bunch but he want about the size of the man he had allowed God to take over in his life the realm of possibility it wasn't a narrow thing the realm became wide open Hallelujah because that that that fear the illusion of fear it'll cause us to pull back from things it'll cause us to pull back from things it can actually create even what what what some of these in the study say fear of rejection and it'll just pull cause people to pull back I'm afraid of being rejected I'm afraid of being turned down I'm afraid they won't like me I'm afraid this right here those are real fears are you hearing me now just stay with me a minute God has never left you nor me as his children to just resolve our own fears that's right God said when things come up I'm going to be right there as a faithful parent and we're going to walk through this I want you to remember of who I have made you who it is that has called you come on now Hallelujah but you see sometimes it'll talk about of how that when a person comes into uh you know like fear and it'll be it could be passed on it says once you're raised in a Culture of Fear like that fear throughout daily lives poor it becomes poor mental and physical health because of it and and and people begin to leave fear driven lives and and children follow suit fear is contagious and we transmit it to the ones we love most that happened when those spies came back 10 of them brought up an evil report and it spread like wildfire they they started posting as soon as they got back we saw this and we saw that it spread and the Bible says the people were wailing outside of their tents as a matter of fact they had so received and fear had so gripped them they were ready to Stone Caleb and Joshua yeah that's right were there to encourage them hey if God be for us they're bread for usall are you hearing me now let's look at this here just a moment I got a few more minutes Deuteronomy 7:1 17 let's just let's just bring this down in realities of where we walk notice when they come into the land God has given them some direction God never said when you cross the River Jordan let me tell you something soon as you cross the River Jordan you'll never have a bit of fear soon as you're circumcised on the other side you'll never be fear come along God never said that am right God never said that God's word always stays true yes amen are you with me God God there's a lot I could say within that God don't need to God doesn't need to add to make himself something am he is his word that's notice in verse 17 if Thou shalt say in thine heart these nations are more than I how can I dispossess them do you notice if Thou shalt say in thy heart as a man thinketh in his heart so is he but God don't say you've already thought it in your heart watch this watch how God's approach Thou shalt not be afraid of them but shal well remember what the Lord thy God did unto pharaoh and unto all Egypt come on you you you're looking at that but I'm going to take you back in your memory and remind you of what you did but what God did the great Temptations which Thine Eyes saw the signs the Wonders the mighty hand the stretched out arm hey look they didn't have to look no further than their own bodies their shoes hadn't worn out their clothes had not become threadbear God had provided water God had provided Mana God had provided everything plus all the all of the great signs and wonders that were done whereby the Lord thy God brought thee out so shall the Lord thy God do unto all the people of whom Thou Art afraid moreover the Lord thy God will send the Hornet among them until that they are left till until they they that are left hide themselves from thee and be destroyed Thou shalt not be frightened at them for the Lord thy God is among you a mighty God and terrible what is he doing he's taking their attention away from what they're looking at as if Thou shalt saying this heart that these nations are mightier than I I'm going to take your attention and put it back where it belongs it is I the Lord that I brought me here and the Lord thy God will put out those Nations before thee by little and little down that thou mayest not consume them at once lest the Beast of the fields increase upon thee but the Lord thy God shall deliver them unto thee and shall destroy them with a mighty destruction until they be destroyed and he shall deliver their kings into thine hand and thou shalt destroy their name from under heaven I'm telling you I'm looking at spiritual kings that have been called to take care of these Kings in that spirit world let me tell you something where at one time the enemy once ruled your life with a certain ho now you are no longer under him but you are now ruling over that which once ruled you [Music] hallelujah what is it Kings have been delivered into your hand spirits of lust spirits of all these other things all they have been delivered and brought subject to what to the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah his name is magnified in your life God told him in verse 25 the Graven image of their gods burn them with fire Thou shalt not desire the silver or gold that's on them don't take it lest thou be snared therein it's an Abomination to the Lord thy God neither shalt thou bring an Abomination into thine house lest thou be a cursed thing like it but Thou shalt utterly detest it and thou shalt utterly abort it for it's a cursed thing who was it that set the standard for what's cursed and what's not God that's right God's word set the standard is that right but you remember as long as Israel when they entered the land as long as they kept the word of God before him it was the ark that went before him the priest carrying it and the word here at the Jordan was open they were to follow the word into battle God would give them the battle plan would give them Direction you know God would give them Direction when they were going into Jericho I want you to burn everything I don't want nothing taken out of it but you know it would be it would be a time later that God would permit him to take the gold sometimes it's just waiting on God's Will and God's timing and God allowed that test to come but as long as Israel would keep the word before him they would keep the word above their ideas their opinions thoughts and actions and in their heart they were victorious but when they took what was forbidden it hindered them it stopped them they did not have perfect faith right to move they ran they ran from their enemies their strength was obedience to the word of God this is why I want you to say that the prophet would talk about one of the greatest curses he says among the church's fear he said you don't know who you are that's he says you know he says you're scared to death about about you're scared to death about so many things but if you realize who you are he said you don't know who you are you don't know who is sitting next to you oh that's my neighbor I I know him real well but he's a Son of God adopted by Jesus Christ into the family that's a daughter of God sitting next to you and who are you if you're a Christian believer you're a son and daughter of God what are you scared about no need of being scared as long as the devil can keep you scared that's all he wants to do he's got you right then if he can just keep you scared yeah Hallelujah my my let me just let me read one more place here God tells them in another place here's in in Deuteronomy 20 verse1 when thou goest out to battle and against thine enemies see horses chariots and people more than thou be not afraid of them for the Lord thy God is with thee which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt and it shall be when ye are come nigh un the battle that the priest shall approach and speak un unto the children and unto the people and say here o Israel approach this day unto battle against your enemies let not your hearts faint fear not and do not tremble neither be you terrified how much how many ways can you say don't be afraid because of them notice God would have a priest a spokesman one that when the battle would come notice the priest was never uh sounding a trumpet of retreat it was always go forward go forward for the Lord your God is he that goeth with you to fight for you against your enemies to save you thank see this is an application that's not just spiritual but it's also as parents as parents we can take the hands of our children spouses one to another as one believer to another encouraging one another of the things sometimes that that we may not understand understand what what the situations and what's being done but God God brought them into these situations but he reminded them I'm right here with you amen are you with me God didn't keep them back from uncomfortable situations he was right there and it says I'm right here with you right oh my you know as I look through the Book of Joshua I'll just close on this I don't know if you've ever looked at it but to me as I've gone through even in the Book of Joshua you look how many times not just in the first chapter but throughout the Book of Joshua how many times that God would speak to Joshua fear not be Not Afraid many chapters it would happen in that way you know what God was showing you always when situations are put before us fear can be there to want to come to paralyze us but God always sends his word word right on time to meet the need for that moment and I'm grateful for it I'm grateful that God will send his word to where it all of a sudden maybe I've got my thoughts are going down a line and you know it's somehow Satan can get a hold of quotes and scriptures and he can nearly run you in the ground but you know when God takes a hold of that God might take a hold of it right through an anointed gift my maybe you're sitting listening to the prophet or or here you are listening to a man of God Minister and all of a sudden you're like I I just heard those quotes but he he he wasn't sounding like that before I just heard those scriptures you know what's the difference it's the anointing that's handling that word it's a word that's reminding you of who you are that even despite your circumstances you're a son and daughter of God and there is a way for victory Hallelujah am after it was all said and done and they came to AI after achen was cleared out then God would tell Joshua fear not and don't be dismayed but go on up to AI right it's yours it's in your hands let's stand let me just make this reference in in another place in Joshua a group of kings came together they came and all of their companies and they were as grasshoppers they were they were gathered together in a high place Miram m e r o m no wonder you know when you think the devil took Jesus up to a high mountain right you know Paul said we war against spiritual wickedness in high places right Paul would also write in Romans 8 that neither height nor depth can separate us from the love of God Satan likes to try to present as though he's got an advantage that's good but listen with God on your side the advantage belongs to you if God be for us who can be against us it was on a high place maybe they had to they were looking and seeing them they were all gathered is it somehow you know they Satan makes way that he could they could just see see it all yeah they've already been through battle at their battle they've already come through Jericho already come through AI they've come through many places already right and God is telling Joshua even at this time in Joshua 11 fear not don't be afraid for tomorrow I'll deliver them into your hand right so what should I do tonight just go and rest just go lay down and rest Glory just just meditate on what I told you but Lord that situation on the job tomorrow just meditate on what I told you my peace just just dwell on that just entertain that but Lord I got this doctor saying just meditate on me my presence I've got this I've got this under control I've got this I'm glad that he's got yeah everything under control including me and you including me and you blessed be the Lord amen let's just pray Heavenly Father Lord we stand here Lord as a as a people Lord that God by your grace that you have redeemed Lord and father we're not ashamed to say that Lord we are needy and we need you Lord oh God how thankful I am that through every Lord circumstance in every situation Lord father you have you have come and you have ministered to our hearts sometimes lord it's been as Lord a tape was being played sometimes lord it's been why we've been reading the scriptures Lord sometimes lord it's come Lord maybe Lord as a text was sent to us Lord in a scripture Lord sometimes lord it's come Lord as we've been setting and hearing Lord the ministering of the word but through it all lord it's been you coming to remind us Lord and that Lord our attention and our Focus would be placed upon the right things Lord father we look Lord we see the natural things around us Israel saw the natural enemies Lord there's things that we can hear Lord and we can see but oh God as our hearts desire Lord we we just want to entertain you Lord we want to entertain your thoughts Lord and I pray father that right here tonight Lord God for every situation for every need Lord if there be like the song would be said Lord if there's any river that you think is uncrossable any mountain that you cannot tunnel through God Specializes in things thought to be impossible and he will do what no other power can do Lord Jesus that is the truth Lord father you our way maker Lord You're the same God who has made a way for us Lord that we could come back to you Lord we could come back to a real living reality in you Lord It's You Lord that called us it's you Lord that gave Lord God the strength Lord of a separated walk it's you Lord that has brought us Lord fully Into You Lord oh God it wasn't you dragging us but it was your presence moving in our life Lord and oh God that would cause us to open and have confidence and just talk to you Lord talk to you about what's on our heart talk to you about Lord the things that we're seeing and Lord I I I need strength Lord I I need God I need Grace to separate from this Lord I need Lord God the strength to walk on with you Lord it opens a confidence is being built Lord a relationship Lord is being built Lord God and Father It's Your Grace Lord that takes us where we need to be no wonder your Prophet when he would speak of the Holy Ghost in the restoration of the brid tree he would refer to the Holy Spirit as the enforcer of God's word and he said let him you let go and let him he'll take you to your healing let go he'll take you to the baptism of the Holy Ghost let go he'll take you to where you need to be where he's calling you oh God no more than Israel brought themselves to where they were but you reminded them that I the Lord have brought you I'm here with you to see you through or no matter the circumstance tonight no matter the doctor's reports no matter thoughts that maybe have plagued Lord the minds maybe thoughts Lord have come in Lord about children or loved ones or this or that or situations Lord that Lord just seem so great but father I pray tonight Lord that we've been able to hear from you Lord to realize you've never left us Lord though Lord God when we see Lord the enemy gather around but you've never left us Lord father you're right there with us you're the one Lord by your presence coming Lord and reminding us Lord that you're the same God who moved in Egypt who led us Lord all the way who opened the Red Sea who's brought us Lord across the Jordan you're the same God to lead us Lord through this Promised Land amen help us Lord things sometimes Lord we face circumstances Lord that could be fearful but Lord I'm thankful that you don't shame us and you don't look down on us and say Samuel How Could You Be Afraid how could you fear [Music] Lord I know what that is but I'm thankful dear God how that you come through your word and you will speak to us Lord and remind us who we are remind us who it is that's been with us all the way granted tonight Lord Lord whatever the need might be Lord from healing to the Holy Ghost maybe besetting sin Lord father we want to have the right mental attitude towards the promise of God taking that adopted baby and as your Prophet said it sets our emotions in the right way we can begin to thank you and rejoice not so much as because we already already have it but because the God who made the promise he will keep every promise and we can thank you Lord as the prophet said as though it's already taken place we can Worship You Lord why because it's certain every word every promise you've made Lord you've never had to take back on on one circumstances has always been present to contest the promise when it's time for that promise to come to pass but Lord just as Lord circumstances as Spirits arise that's when Lord you made a promise that you raise the standard against the enemy amen we're resting on you Lord we're resting on you we're trusting in you Lord not in our abilities we're trusting in you we just we yield Lord even right now we yield our thoughts Lord we yield it all to you Lord like your Prophet would tell us in the prayer letter that went with the prayer cloth he said begin to doubt your doubts and believe God's word and call those things that are not as though they are if there's anything out of line confess it make it right and stand upon God's word Lord we love you tonight in the name of Jesus [Music] Christ Rivers you think that you [Music] think God any mountain you came to through God Specializes in things thought impossible and he will do what no other power can do God any rivers you think God

Might Mountain you can through oh God special he [Music] specializes he he will do what no other [Music] you know I was thinking about months ago when we were I was studying through a lot of this and I thought about when we had Paul and how that um it looked at that time we didn't know you know the doctors thought we were just new parents you know that were just a little bit you know weary but my wife they didn't know my wife had a bad infection her iron was super low I remember we got home and she didn't even have strength to care for Paul and uh I remember you know I gave him bottle and you know trying to get sleep I mean you all know how that is when you're when they just come home and man I sure wasn't planning on that I would be the guy doing that and doing all that but my wife was really sick is what I'm trying to tell you a lot of you remember that she was whiter than these walls she did not have strength in her [Music] body and there was a fear that had set in after that about not wanting to have a fear of having any more children that fear was real she didn't she didn't talk talk about it but it was there but one day if I don't get all this details right she can come and tell it at a different time but one day you know my wife she'll a lot of times I when I come home I hear it either at singing going it's brother brandham going I she'll have somebody some Minister playing it's sometimes I have to tell her when I'm getting ready for church honey H I got have to pluck my ears I love hearing them you know but I understand and I you know what I'd rather have that than anything else but you know here she was cleaning house one day and she had she was streaming one of brother Donnie's servic and all they had was Auto Audio at the time that was back in 2000 was it two honey 2002 and all of a sudden here she stops the sweeper and on that moment on that on that message I don't even know what message it was but what came right across there is sister don't you be afraid to have any more children Hallelujah Glory right there at that moment my wife testifies to this right there at that moment that fear left and the result right there right there God moved down see God knows our [Music] needs Satan would like to you know oh you should never have fear as a child of God well fear is never meant to be have a place in our life that's true but Satan's a liar Satan's the kind of guy that'll hand you something and turn around and come against you and say how in the world could you receive that as though that something's wrong with you but all it takes is the presence of God to come by your way and my way that's all it takes is one word from him no wonder if you think how many times brother br will say it Lord just one word from you will mean more yeah than all the other words that's why we come here we're sitting in the house of God it might be just one word One phrase out of a whole message one word but all it takes is one word one word that comes from him God in rivers you think God uncrossable oh God any mountains that you oh as we're singing it I want you just to put yourself right there God Specializes in things impossible oh and he will do one no other oh one more time God in rivers you think un oh he's a way [Music] maker oh that you can turn [Music] through but God in impossible thank you Lord and He will do one other power can do
