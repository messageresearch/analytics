people coming together but there's with one purpose there's with one mind one intent Lord that's Lord that we might have a meeting with you father Lord how we love to see one another how it just Lord with me hear one another's voice see one another just something about it Lord it just so touches us Lord but Lord if it was just one another I'm sure we would leave here disappointed because Lord it's you that we've come to see it's you that we've come to hear from Lord it's you that holds the mystery of our life it's you Lord [Music] knows about us Lord we are your children Lord Lord so father tonight Lord we just invite you Lord invite you that you would come Lord now as the songs of Zion Lord have been sung worshiped Lord that has come from the hearts of your children Lord to press Beyond weariness and tiredness Lord of mind and body and spirit Lord we're asking Lord tonight that there would be a deposit of the Eternal things that Lord behind the hands that were lifted up Lord that God that you would just come in a very personal way that as your children Lord beyond the circumstances we believe that you are God and that you keep your word Lord and the father there's no mountain there's no circumstance that's beyond you Lord and frankly Lord as a Believer you spoke to us if thou can'tst believe nothing shall be impossible to you Lord your Prophet would remind us of that of how we stand as Believers so we're not standing here tonight based on our feelings we're standing here Lord God as Believers Lord because Lord we believe you Lord we are trusting in you Lord and so father we just ask that you would now just take control in the further part of the service anoint these lips of clay Lord anoint our hearts together Lord that God we might enter into that place that Lord with you and in Fellowship Lord where the word Lord just comes speaks to our hearts to encourage us to minister Lord to our needs Lord I pray help us the Lord we love you and we thank you and our father in Jesus name amen and amen God bless you it's good to be here tonight isn't it and so good to be in the house of the Lord and as you're turning to Job chapter 23 appreciate song leading the musicians and just the atmosphere that a man has created it's just um it's very it's very sweet it's very peaceful and the friends of God and as he comes and that's so good to see each one of you and some that have been out and back in brother Rocco is good to have brother Rocco back here with us and and so uh you know we sometimes we fight battles of sickness and things in our body and different ones that I know as we we go through that but God is faithful amen through it all and uh just really enjoyed the service on Sunday evening if you haven't had a chance uh you say I'm not a young person that that service you you could it doesn't matter you that service could be preached it could be preached to 80 year olds because it's the message of the hour you see the message of the hour when it's preached it doesn't need to be watered down for young people it just needs to be preached you know it's not it's not man trying to show man something it's God it's everything that we can never underestimate is the supernatural because even when you and I to get anything out of this service tonight it'll take the Holy Ghost it'll take the Supernatural and so we're just depending on him tonight and just appreciate brother Ronnie just coming and uh my just we we had a good time you know and brother Ronnie was talking even in the after service and he said he said I felt like I was even getting pulled from the back and uh you know because it we are just feeding on the word of God and uh we just we love the Lord I believe with all my heart we were our young people here and those that were with us we're very benefited amen and so Job chapter 23 and verse 8. I want to read this going into this again laying this Foundation here in verse 8 job declares behold I go forward but he is not there and backward but I cannot perceive him and on the left hand where he does work but I cannot Behold Him he hideth himself on the right hand that I cannot see him but he knoweth the way that I take and when he hath tried me I shall come forth as gold. my foot hath held his steps and I want you to notice this that job is here and he's making a case and we're just dealing with it in this aspect of the scriptures right now or job is able to say the testimony that's been throughout is I've held his steps so job's not in a place which we know God's grace can reach to you and I like it did to Hezekiah when Hezekiah called out to God and says Lord give Grace that I can set my house in order right but for job here what job is looking at my foot hath held his steps and his way so this has been a testimony throughout and his way have I I kept and I've not declined neither have I gone back from the Commandment of his lips I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food I just say it like this in verse 11 and verse 12 can be wrote in my commentary I don't care if there's not one Miracle that's mentioned let that be I believe in miracles our lives are a miracle but if there's never anything that's if it's if it's recorded and you know those that we prayed for and sick and received the Holy Ghost because it's it's not man that's done and anyhow we're just instruments of God but if none of that's wrote If this is if I have my choice of what it is that I I want to be wrote in the commentary this is what I want to be wrote that Samuel was faithful that's that's that's what that's what our desire is because that's what the Rapture is all about it's it's to the faithful amen so we just want to just speak on that a few moments here once again on that word faithful once again God bless you as you're being seated tonight I want to pick up and I want to read this out of three kinds of Believers here again because this this quote is what really is I'm looking at this with faithfulness and when we look at it let me just read it here first brother Brian says sometimes Believers are put to the test and not sometimes but every time for every son that cometh to God must be chastened tried child trained and remember the trials the dusty roads I think it's very fitting I love these descriptions Dusty Rhodes you know how dusty roads are anybody ever tried there's some roads believe it or not in Ohio that are actually Dusty roads there was a place and I think it's near um by the time you'd have to help me out it was it Fredericton where sister Norma lived at one time and the roads that were out there were literally like what we have right out here in the parking lot and when you drove on them you couldn't go very fast and I'm not talking about chip and seal Country Roads I'm talking about the 57 gravel and you're driving on and if somebody starts going very fast you don't see anything it's just a cloud of dust and sometimes we have the dusty roads where you can't see very clearly ahead of you right a lot of the dusty road and it's dry you know it's not mud flinging up it's just dry and it's just dry and all you see is the dust and but that's where trust and that's where faith comes in as a Believer just to trust God and says I know that right beyond all of this Cloud God's still God he's right here he's never left if God has if God has opened this way and led me down this dusty road because the way of the Lord for our life is not that we were all all together always travel on the interstate right nor on toll roads or everything else but there's some roads that we have to travel on that are not very welcoming roads as a matter of fact one of the roads that I was on when we went up to that camp in Australia at that Retreat I was a little concerned with some of the brothers and sisters you know some had come in for uh the meetings uh with at the youth camp and I remembered the track on the way up there and as we were going up there and they take the young people up in buses so the young people don't have to travel back and forth and uh I I remember I told Brother Daniel when the when the saints some of the older ones were leaving and like on after a Sunday evening service I said oh I said may God be with them because that road was not forgiving we're talking there's no guard rails and the roads are not real wide I said oh Lord Jesus help your children I mean I know there no doubt have traveled it many times but sometimes the roads that we're on are not roads that maybe feel very comfortable but if God is leading us then how tell you I you know I wouldn't want to be anywhere else other than where he's at amen we want to be right where he's at so we notice that the trails the dusty roads the hot sun of persecution and this is the the part I want us to draw from but the Loyalty of your heart beats that material till she is ready to go into the mold and God's children is made up correctly on his word for they are living examples and the word of God living through them so the trial comes to shake you to put you to the very bottom to see where you'll stand and I want to just come back to that the Loyalty of your heart beats that material until she's ready to go into the mold through the midst of a test and of a trial and tests and Trials come in many different forms sometimes the way that it can be it can come as a sickness it can come as something you're just laboring and you're praying for and you're praying for a period of time and a period of time and you just seem like there's maybe not getting attraction that you want and and yet in the midst of it here you are that through it discouragement can come Whispers of Doubt can come but the Loyalty in your heart is what stabilizes things the Loyalty in your heart to what to the word is what beats the material it's like when they take that of the uh you know our heart is not God does not liken it to that of brass because brass cannot be uh it's it speaks of judgment it can't be tempered that easily but our heart it would speak of that of even gold something that's very malleable something that's able to be molded and that's how the character is in our life remember the Holy Ghost is the gift of God the character is a victory and so that loyalty even when even when things go against our grain or our feelings but yet we can say Lord Thy word is true above my feelings what's happening it's just a beating on the material just a little bit it's just beating that material what's it doing it's molding that character what is doing that the Loyalty of your heart so it's not the person in whom you might be tested by their responses or things or your boss or co-work or family or or sickness it's the Loyalty of our heart that's actually molding and shaping our character and I I love how the prophet puts it it's not something that's just you know that's just it's just so easily taking place it's beating that material it's beating it it's working on it it's that loyalty of the heart that's beating out patience it's beating out just just trusting it's beating out forgiveness it's beating out all of these things it's there that loyalty that's molding that character throughout and that's where when we stand where job is is having this testimony here right now to be loyal is to be faithful how many know what brother Bram said when he's asked a question how do I win my loved ones to the Lord what did Brother Ram say he said be loyal to what you believe see it's now when we're dealing with loyal faithful it's dealing with expression it's dealing with action and so when we look at this I want to just hear tonight look a little bit further on this of faithful because uh in the scripture because to be faithful it means to remain loyal and steadfast it's also to be reliable it's to be true to the facts of the original I I you know there's nothing about our flesh that's reliable nothing but what is reliable is the word of God and if our life is sown with the word of God and that seed within us it's that which God has come to Quicken and raise up and that's what God is relying on his his own word so if there's something you know I mean you know we can say this on an in the natural in a job some of you are standing supervisors and other things else you know that there's some people you just don't rely on you know I mean if you say well they ought to be like you know better don't don't you're working yourself up find somebody who's reliable and God himself he looks for and he searches and God loves to display that which is reliable is that right because God's desire is for his word to be fulfilled and I'm sure that as we look at this tonight it's not all together the way that we sometimes interpret reliable or faithful or anything because we could put ourselves in a foxhole but it's something to where you can be even counted on it's like that person as I said on the job it isn't that they do everything perfect but you can count on them they're going to be there they're going to do this they're faithful they're loyal and I believe that's what God intends to bring forth out of every one of our Lives as a matter of fact that's what God does within the life of the believer and that becomes a distinguishing quality of a Believer they are called faithful the bible let me just start in with this I refer to this scripture last last week to start off First Corinthians chapter 1 verse 9 God is faithful not was not will be but he is faithful in Lamentations 3 18 I said my strength and my hope is perished from the Lord remembering mine Affliction and my misery the wormwood and the gall my soul hath them still in remembrance and this is humbled in me this I recall to mind therefore have I hope it is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed because his compassions fail not you understand you and I can't even talk about faithfulness if we're not looking to God who is faithful because man does not make man faithful [Applause] pledges to come to church pledge us to do this it'll never make man faithful but God who is faithful makes faithful subjects it has an effect it is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed because his compassions fail not they are new every morning great is thy faithfulness the Lord is my portion saith my soul therefore will I hope in him the Lord is good unto them that wait for him to the soul that seeketh him it is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the Salvation of the Lord and the message questions and answers brother Brown said I don't know he's talking about answering questions I don't know whether they got on backsliding but I thought I wish somebody would ask me that about on backsliding remember you backslide every day no way at all for you to keep out of it but you backslide to the people at church but not before God notice before the people at church but not before God now let me work this here now a little bit you see you backslide on Christ but you don't on God cause if you would when you sin you're gone but you're constantly falling Paul had to die every day he had to die every day to repent every day and just constantly repenting all the time and if Paul had to do that then I'm going to have to too aren't you are you with me now so you see in Christ the same thing with Abraham and Sarah when Sarah laughed God would have slew her but she was identified in her Union with Abraham and that's why brother Branham all the way through the message will take this and say if it wasn't that we were hidden in Christ he said God would take us out but notice we are identified by his life in the blood and it is his life that's expressing through you and I you know it's his life inside of you and me that brings conviction in our life that leads us to a place to say forgive me and it may not have even been anything you said or done but it's a thought that came through your life or it's something that may be an attitude that you've sensed and you say Lord forgive me why because you realize I am in his presence all the time and God is faithful he doesn't leave me and then come back but his presence is right around me the whole time and because of that awareness great is his faithfulness I want to stay in favor with God I want his presence if I can put it like this I want God to be so at home in my life he can put his head in my lap he can lean back on the recliner he can take his shoes off he can find rest refreshment and Joy by fellowshipping in my life good appreciate Oh Glory and I know this brother goes on in part two of that question and answer he said now we were talking on the word backsliding this morning and when you do that you're Bachelorette yes sir you got to repent now I don't mean to say you went out in the world you did this and that but you done something and you've got to repent and Die daily to live in Jesus Christ but Samuel I feel so bad thank God you feel so bad if you didn't feel bad about it something's wrong with you so every daily every day you've got to die every day to live in Christ Jesus Psalms 119 89. forever O Lord Thy word is settled in heaven thy faithfulness is unto all generations thou Hast establish the Earth and it abideth they continue this day according to thine ordinances for all are thy servants remember his first Bible he wrote it in the heavens remember when job is referred to uh God refers him God takes him to the heavens is that right you'll even find it I believe it's in Amos and you'll find that many of the Minor Prophets they will refer to that of seek Him who holdeth the Seven Stars in his sand in the belt of Orion right it will speak to that of the of the consolation it will speak to there as David said he hath declared his handiwork his Heaven the heavens declare his handiwork so God wrote his first Bible in the heavens and to know that even in the ordinances themselves the moon and the stars all of the things the uh the Moon is set for the ordinances the keeping of time you see it on your calendar when it's going to be a new moon when it's going to be you know partial Moon and when it's going to be a full moon all of that those are ordinances that have been set by God and though time has changed a lot of man has lived on the Earth but not one of those ordinances has ever been changed God's never went back one time and said you know what I think we need to put the moon over here or I think we need to do it over there let me tell you something whatever is touched by man will fail but when it's in God's hands it'll remain and it'll take off on time just exactly and he will continue to declare the handiwork of God so I'd say God help me to get my hands off of everything let me let me put it into your hands and most importantly my life in your hands Lord every situation every need in your hands Lord God because they are upheld remember they are upheld by the word of his power in Psalms 36 5 thy mercy O Lord is in the heavens and thy faithfulness reacheth unto the clouds oh it goes far beyond that of man all the failures in every other realm but God's faithfulness endureth Mercy in the heavens aren't you glad that God has Mercy reserved for you and I now remember what Mercy is reserved for is Mercy remember those that will repent Mercy is given so don't ever be ashamed to repent hey man it's something that you know let me just say it like this listen repentance is not living in a defeated State that's living in a kind of place to wherein your walk with God to where constantly daily Moment by moment your desire is am I pleasing to my Lord or my thoughts or the thoughts in my mind are they pleasing to the Lord are my actions pleasing to the Lord are the things that I'm looking at is it pleasing unto the Lord because remember he is an All-Seeing Eye that is watching you and I and I want fellowship with him he wants fellowship with you amen God is coming back for a people who cares because he careth for you he made a way that you and I might even be able to care if he hadn't made a way through him by the blood we would never be able to rightfully care but he made a way that you and I could care the right way oh thank God Isaiah 25 1 oh Lord Thou Art my God I will exalt thee I will praise thy name for thou Hast done wonderful things thy councils of old are faithfulness and Truth you see God's reputation sometimes it's been a long time coming for a promise to be fulfilled but God ain't never forgot about it like Peter would pick up under inspiration God is Not slack concerning any of his promises don't look around and say man this generation this is too bad no we're fullness is to all generations that's why every generation as the prophet said must have their fresh chance at the word of God in other words the same baptism of the Holy Ghost is available to every generation he's the Living God he never ceased he never diminished as a matter of fact if you really want to know it the right way that the word has not diminished the word has only grown in intensity and power and glory amen that word was demonstrated and manifested through the vessel of God's prophet in this hour but think about it in a many member body where people and lives are willing to forget about their ideas forget about themselves and the glory and the power of God can be made manifest through a body of Believers I say the faithfulness of God is so great he's faithful God ain't never got himself into something where he said I'm In Too Deep he's faithful a promise might linger but though it Tarry God will fulfill it every promise everything that God has said I wonder how I've wondered many times over the years how that many of them when brother Branham would stand there and make the statements that he would make regarding this generation and you know I'm not you know I didn't live in the 50s but I'm not you know Coy to understand that I know there were some rotten things even back then I mean when my family went down to um Gatlinburg there many many years ago about uh you know and went through that Titanic Museum I remember them pointing out names and things like that of of a man you know different ones who lawyers doctors whatever they had their wife on this deck and their mistress on the underdeck so there was rottenness always around brother Ram told us with homosexuality he told us back then it was filled in the government he also told us regarding think about when he would stand there and he's announcing this world is falling apart and to think about look look listen when you think back to those times and in that moment right there I wonder what they thought but what it is he's looking at there is a seed that's being sown you can't sow the wrong seed and expect a different crop but if you sow the seed of the word God is faithful to his word it might take a while for the crop to come to fruition But be sure you're sowing God's word because if you show God's word then God will water it God will bring the increase and God will see it through now I want to read this here in the Book of Psalms chapter 12 verse 1. I want you to look at this here for a moment the Bible said here is David writing help Lord for The Godly Man ceaseth for the faithful fail from Among The Children of Men they speak vanity in other words it's emptiness everyone with his neighbor with flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak the Lord shall cut off on flattering lips in the tongue that speaketh proud things who have said with our tongue will we Prevail our lips are on who is Lord over us for the oppression of the poor for the sang of the needy now will I will arise saith the Lord I will set him in safety from him that puffeth at him I want you to watch here you know this is why when brother Brandon said he would say it throughout in the seals and he says he said if you're thinking one thing and saying another he said you better stop that he said because we're getting we're coming to a time it's a little different now he's not talking about thoughts passing through but he's talking about speak the truth from your heart right and I'm not talking about walking around and saying well I'm a miserable Christian that ain't God's language I tell you what the prophet called it he called that the devil's language I don't have very much Faith he said that's what the devil wants you to say I don't want to talk his language God changed my language I don't want nothing to do with the devil's language so what is the devil's language negative with a capital N say God help me to be a positive Pete not a Negative Nancy forgive me if your name's Nancy but you know how it is you you walk with people that sometimes all they can see is the glass oh it's half empty oh it's half to empty half empty oh it's from it's just well brother Samuel it's half empty no it's half full it's half full listen friends because we're in this negative house there is a tendency there is a there can be a tendency I know we all can be made up differently but may God help you and I to listen I wonder if we would record our conversation sometimes I wonder the percentage how much of the time are we positive or negative well brother Samuel I'm just trying to be humble well let me update you on what humility is that is not humility that is you looking at a situation whether you're criticizing whether you're taking something down or you're looking at it in a way of human instrumentality let me just say this all the way through this building right here when we speak of the word faithful not one of us can Pat ourselves on the back as though that we have made ourselves faithful we are faithful because of his faithfulness convert is that right there is nobody here that can take Glory of that it is God it is God's mercies the Lord's compassions that we are not consumed well by the Samuel what good does that do well it does a lot of good because you see when we get to looking on ourselves or our goodness God knows just how to bring about a real humility in our lives so we get our eyes off of ourselves as though that we had something to do with it we have nothing to do with it it's our yielding to his voice it's believing what he said despite our own thoughts or thoughts that we ourselves can have it is believing what God has said that's where overcoming lies now notice this right here the words I want you to watch how David goes here the words of the Lord are pure words as silver tried in a furnace of Earth purified seven times I know he brought this back to my mind where I was talking to you about humility how many knows remember the Jerry preached on complaining remember that boy that was too long he ain't listening in tonight man no I'm just teasing teasing but you know what I thought when he was preaching I shared with him after service I thought of that out of the message uniting time and sign and brother Brandon says you know he said God help me he said sometimes you've seen when people get older he said they get they get an old crabby cantankerous Spirit around them all they want to do and sometimes it ain't just even older it's just younger I mean and sometimes you listen to me how can that be some of the aches the pains the sickness and the trials and the tests and everything of life right not make an excuse but I look out brother Brown was saying it he's seen this he said God Don't Let Me Be Lonely let my life be crowned that way let my life be crowned with the fruit of the spirit and then he makes something a statement very simple he said Do You Realize complaining weakens faith complaining weakens faith do you realize even in things that you're praying about I'm praying about we're looking to God in our lives and other things like that but you realize it might be something to come right across our pathway has seemingly nothing to do with that but complaining itself can weaken the very faith that's needed to move through that promise I say Lord help us help me help me Lord now notice let me read this in verse six the words of the Lord are pure words as silver tried in a furnace of Earth purified seven times Thou shalt keep them O Lord Thou shalt preserve them from this generation Forever The Wicked walk on every side when the vilest men are exalted so David is letting it be known the faithful the faithful fail from out of the Earth where is The Godly man but God is faithful is he not now how does God prove his word god proves his word through believers right God has said there wouldn't be there would be Believers that would go into the promised land but there were those who rose up bought a bad report those that joined with it and said we can't do it our kids are going to you know they don't they it's too tough It's too tight it's too you know and all these excuses they had that aren't that land will consume our kids but you know what God couldn't prove his word through him why they weren't believers but the two who were Joshua and Caleb God proved his word through them as a matter of fact brother Branham tells us like this and proving his word God himself crossed over into the promised land through the Believers of that day oh my available truth God been in London I've been desire within our heart is Lord let me just stand true to you who are faithful and God who is faithful will prove his faithfulness through surrendered lives but for these right here David has wrote right here God will not compromise God don't have to trim the gospel God don't have to manufacture it you see many times the things that's done is to try to make the gospel palable let me just bring it on down maybe to try to make the message palatable I'm not interested in making this message look good or making it palatable what I'm interested is preaching it in power and the authority it was delivered in because this message was not sent for goats this message was sent to call the Sheep of God into the Liberty they're longing forth you'll never make a goat a sheep but a sheep will be led forth from the bondage that they're in into a glorious Liberty this gospel doesn't need to be watered down that's what the world has done what's did that the reasoning of man that's why everything is so filled it's become as the scripture said every table is become filthy and full of vomit God if people don't want to be heed to God's word God will keep his word from them that's what this is just saying right here if people do not want to heed to the word of God and allow the word to examine their lives then God will keep his word he will not reveal himself to them but for lives that desire to be faithful to God through thick sin up down through every situation even to be able to stand there time and time again daily and say Lord forgive me Lord help me Lord God give me strength Lord once again faithfulness to the word I we don't want to stand there and make excuses when we're confronted with the word well my daddy was like this my mama was like that that's called Disobedience but we want to stand on the word to a faithful God to know there's no spirit that has been down through time it might have traveled down through that family tree for a long time but there is no spirit that has been unconquered but as a matter of fact he is the mighty conqueror he tore hell to Pieces he conquered every great demon and he rose again and he gave that same authority of the baptism of the Holy Ghost back to the believer and says you shall possess the Gate of every enemy no matter what comes up against you you've got the power in you to possess that gate you've got the authority to possess the Gate of every devil that rises its head and I'm just simple enough to believe it just simple enough to believe it oh my it portrays God's faithfulness through lives that just surrender to him now notice this in first Samuel 2 35. see God's interested in faithfulness now remember when the priesthood itself was instituted and you had the high priest and then all of those in the levitical priesthood that would be there now remember here you find that these are the sons of Eli and what Eli's Sons had done you know there were things that they were not doing what was right they were doing some very subtle deceitful things and so forth that Eli himself was not it was not unknown to him there were things that he knew about but Eli was not correcting or pending to that so then notice how within this with that fallibility of manner the breakdown you'll notice how that the spirit of God will pick up and prophecy will come forth such as in verse 35 where he is speaking about the coming of the Lord Jesus our Melchizedek I Will Raise Me Up notice who's talking God is speaking I will face me up a faithful priest that shall do according to that which is in the mine heart and in my mind and I will build him a sure house and he shall walk before mine anointed forever I remember brother Bill shared something with me years ago I don't remember the name the exact number now but brother Jerry referred to it when the high priest would go in once a year and he would have to go in with the blood you know it would represent not only for his own but then also to atone for that of the congregation once a year and while all that was speaking of is that once and for all it would be done through Calvary right but remember if that priest if there was something that was out of line remember the pomegranates and the bell sure it's a sound of Joy but if those on the outside did not hear that that's why they tied that rope to his leg they knew that guy's dead because he's come into the presence of God and there's things that's not right and what happened he fell dead and I can't remember the exact number brother bill sent it to me the one time it was an astronomical number of priests ones after another when you take the span of the years that had died that had lived Unfaithful and had died even through the ceremonial place let me just say it like this as much as man could even try there were some that we can look at in the Old Testament and say they were faithful individuals but God here is speaking of something much deeper of to where that the coming of the Holy Ghost would bring about a faithful priesthood a faithful ones those that would be Kings and Priests unto our God and he says I Will Raise Me Up a faithful priest let me tell you something anything that God raises up it will have this quality in it anything that God brings forth it'll be faithful so how can you say that once again look at the Moon look at the stars is that right right now notice with this faithful priest Hebrews 2 17 wherefore in all things that behooved him to be made like unto his Brethren that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God to make reconciliation for the sins of the people so not only did he come down God came down that he might understand this he might experience all of that the Temptation the pressures and all of those things that would come about we knew even how brother Brown would tell us that he even experienced headache he experienced a lot of those a lot of those different things God was able he's experienced it so God is able to be able to relate to you and I not by knowledge but because he has undergone the same experience he is a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God so the whole objective is to bring a Reconciliation between God and man that's what the faithfulness of God does the faith faithfulness you see the faithfulness of God working to bring about that reconciliation between God and man it affects every other relationship it affects everything about around in our life and God's main focus within this was to bring a Reconciliation and a Harmony well if that's the way this that's the way his faithfulness did I think that ought to be the same way within our lives we ought to be faithful to live in harmony the Bible goes over and over that that the Bible would say follow holiness with all men right following peace without such no man shall see God it would also go on to say live peaceably with all men as much as possible that doesn't mean that we're drawing limits what it means is is that there are limitations because just as much as you can live it's more important you live Peaceable here are you hearing me it's you and I live in Peaceable here well you don't know what so-and-so is doing to me no no it's not about so-and-so does the Loyalty of your heart beat out peace it's all about because then we're getting into passing the buck and when I can't do this and I can't no no remember who has made you Faithful a faithful God and if a faithful God has bring about he's done a faithful work in your life he's filled you with the Holy Ghost that's a faithful work that's God seeing a word through it might have been years it might have been months amen may not have been all of a sudden and no matter what it was God never gave up on you he never gave up on me why because we are a part of that word and God is faithful you'll never find one place there'll never be one person that'll stand there that day at the white Throne judgment and be able to accuse God of throwing in the towel not one of them [Music] but it will be they threw in the town they got tired oh but let me tell you this right now regardless God's word is faithful and God is faithful I may not see everything yet in my life but God is faithful and if there's something that's to be moved out of the way God is faithful to show me what is to be moved out of the way [Applause] oh my mama notice in Psalms 40 verse 10 let me just skip to that here he is here this is the speaking this is one of the Messianic Psalms it's speaking of the very life of Jesus Christ the God's Own Life coming down to you and I I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation I have not concealed thy loving kindness and thy truth from the great congregation so God raising up a faithful high priest God becoming one of us blue brown would say it just simply like this he says God took upon him our form that he might mold in US his character there was no other way to bring it there was no other way to bring this unite uniting this Unity I mean that in itself you know you continue to come back to that I mean it strikes your heart to recognize it wasn't us it's not us seeking after God it's God seeking it's God coming down for you and I to make a way and the faithfulness of God was not concealed but it was manifested the word that was promised it was manifested did they catch it no not right then when it was happening think about God's faithfulness even in the Fulfillment of those who were sick in their body the Bible tells us in the Book of Matthew that he came and he healed many that were bound with spirits and diverse diseases that it might be fulfilled has it said that he bore their infirmities even as he's walking here upon Earth it's a declaration of the faithfulness of God don't you understand that's why that when they were walking on the road to Emmaus I'm the mess Emmaus they were walking they were sad they were disheartened and he steps out now he could have uncovered their eyes right then but he chose to do it the same way he does it for you and I he opens our eyes and reveals himself through his word because what does that do it shows you an eye that even in the midst of our down or our grief like it was for those disciples they couldn't understand it but when he was able to take them and beginning with the prophets and through the Psalms he was able to show them God's faithfulness the coming of this Messiah is a faithfulness and a fulfillment of every promise and that's why God in this generation he took every promise and he shook it before the Church of the Living God and there was not one promise that God himself did not raise up and manifest that he still the same yesterday today and forever why that you and I might have a complete confidence in the faithfulness of almighty God that no matter how dark it is but the light pierces through the darkness God is faithful Hallelujah glory be to God 's the one who makes us faithful in Hosea chapter 2. now this is here in the midst of this in Hosea 2. he goes in the verses before this he's speaking of the Millennium coming on you'll find that many in the Minor Prophets but then you know it would seem like well everything should go in a chronological order many times in scriptures but it don't you find with prophets they'll break back and forth in inspiration is that right even you find Zechariah 12 8 in the evening time it shall be light it's it's smacked right in the middle not it's not a chronological listing but you get those it just goes to show us that you know what when it looks like everything's all over God's right in the middle of it I preached the message one time God's never let me preach it here but I I preached it out and God dropped it one time and I was out ministering it and I just I preached on just that Junction between that that colon and the next word in Isaiah 61 and how that God working through among the Gentiles and I'll tell you we just you know you preach up those Inspirations like that it's the grace of God that steps right in the middle of the situation so just because you think you know the next event let me just tell you God is right there oh my it ain't the end of the story amen Hosea chapter 2 verse 9 so here the prophet under inspiration breaks forth in the return of the 144 000 the Jews to come back into the Fulfillment of the word and they received their promise now notice verse 19 God's speaking prophetically unto that I will betroth thee unto me forever yea I will betrothy unto me in righteousness and in judgment and in loving kindness and in mercies I will even betrothy unto me in faithfulness and thou shalt know the Lord his faithfulness to keep his word who is it that enters the sanctuary in the marriage first you know you and when they're going to have a marriage ceremony the man right I know today we got it to where the the woman's asking the man will you marry me they got all mixed up but who enters first the man what's the man showing I'm the initiator of this Covenant I'm the one that has sought this out right sure there's been a reciprocated who's going to walk down the aisle has reciprocated what has been sought out and is Desiring to come into that Covenant and let me just say this to you right now the almighty God as the prophet said that he will be made known to Israel his power and His glory will be made known among them the preaching of those two witnesses will be the same Ministry that you and I are under right now that's pointing to Jesus Christ is the true atonement it'll be the outpouring of the same baptism of the Holy Ghost amen and they will have come as the prophet said to know his power to know his glory to know his character and when they shall see him and he reveals himself to them then there'll be a weeping but you see I'll betrothy to me and faithful how could you and I be faithful without him how it's got to be him and then all on him without him that can do nothing let me tell you there ain't not one of us that has the track record like God but if we could have that we wouldn't need God but that's why we need him he is my everything great is that faithfulness oh God not only that you could save a Wretch like me but you keep working with my life you keep molding me keep shaking me Great Is Thy Faithfulness oh God like that stone brother Ronnie when he was preaching and he showed that big old chunk of marble you asked Michelangelo some of the statements Michelangelo said regarding that chunk of stone he said inside of there was Michelangelo and he said it was I was commissioned to set him free he was in there but I was commissioned to set him free let me tell you something God knew what was down on the inside of this muck [Applause] that was looked over but what's inside the stone it takes one with a vision in his mind to know what he's put in there and what he put in there will not be different than what he thought and what he thought will not be different than what he spoke he will all line up to be the wired itself manifested in faithfulness I read this to you last week too let me just try to bring this down it's numbers 12 7 my servant Moses is not so remember Moses will be in question by Miriam and Aaron who is faithful in all mine house now this is what Moses taken up for himself this is God taken up for Moses I mean it's one thing for you and me to say hey I'm faithful it's another thing for God to say he's faithful in all my house do you realize that though Moses himself was an instrument used by God to bring forth the expression of the heavenly and that expression of the Heavenly of that Tabernacle it was speaking of God's desire to get back to his rightful position in the heart of man and God took it through little types through the scripture slowly unfolding this mystery God is faithful just little here little they're little here a little they're a little what's he doing he's unfolding this mystery of his coming in Bride form where he will Tabernacle in his children now just as much as Moses we can say was faithful in all my house and Paul we read of that last week in the book of Hebrews but you understand that even when Moses stood there before pharaoh and Pharaoh could have all of them Jenny's and jambres withstood them and everything else but Moses in the midst of that time remember when Pharaoh said you go tell him to make bricks without straw people complained Moses thought boy this was going to be a great Revival he finds out he's about ready to get fried what does Moses do something different than what he did before he went to God he didn't run away and say I guess that was some wild thought no it was he had met God and what had been wrote upon his life was that revelation it was wrote there to where that even when Moses was standing before God Moses couldn't even get away from the calling of God he made every excuse why he was not a fit candidate that's what the presence of God does it reminds us of that we are nothing we can do nothing Lord we need you right but here Moses this is what's different I believe this fits very much to you and I the faithfulness was not that Moses oh he should not have went and cried out to God no he did he went to the right Source he went to the Lord and said Lord but I thought you brought me down here to deliver them but you see God doesn't give the time frame God doesn't have to give all the logistics God just said this is my word this is the season well what's all the increments this day this week this month no it's my time to fulfill the word just stand faithful Moses how do I stand faithful just stand up on what I've revealed to you he went to the right source I think many times that's the things that for us Lord help me to go to the right source let us go back to the right Source go to God let me read this here in closing I love this scripture Nehemiah chapter 9 verse 7. this is another one in the Old Testament I want you to watch how this is wrote of Abraham Thou Art the Lord the god who did his choose Abram and brought us him forth out of UR of the chaldees and gavest him the name of Abram do you read anything in there that Abraham did no you chose him you brought him and you gave him so was Abraham just walking around and God just picked him up and putting him down no but he was yielding even in times where Abraham went down to Egypt the heart in the land like a maybe Young new Christian it got hard man he went down to Egypt that didn't change God's choose see to the rest of the church it'd be that guy's backslid because a church can see that he went down to Egypt but God deals with Abram's heart he ain't gonna let Abraham get away with it Abraham's going to repent God deals with his heart to bring him into a place of repentance is that right now watch this this word that's used in verse 8. mama and found us I love this his heart faithful before thee and made us the Covenant with him to give the land the Canaanites hidites amorites parasites jebusites gurga sites to to give it I say to his seed and has performed thy words for thou art righteous you know sometimes Abraham's actions didn't match the promise but in his heart he was ready to repent remember thou Hast found us his heart faithful so there's no way to say there's no way that any person could say my heart is faithful and actions speak contrary right so faithfulness itself remember the commentary when wrong when Paul would write in the Book of Romans Paul would write what God saw in Abraham is that right and James would write about what the outside world soul right well you know remember it it it what it had to be there had to be a reflection whatever that God saw in Abraham was now become visible to the rest of those that would be around it's just like when Moses went down to Egypt God knew what was in his heart but his faithfulness in his actions was a witness to pharaoh it was a witness to Pharaoh because it was wrote on Moses heart and here was Abraham's standing that even in the midst when he was wrong he was willing to repent what God revealed what God saw in Abraham God saw his faithful heart and now I think of it man saw the display of the faithfulness that God saw in his heart through his works it was the works and that's why when we understand it's not by works that were saved but remember Faith itself without works is dead that's the Bible is that right Jesus said who said that he says uh you know in John 14 12 that he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also a faithfulness to the word that's what his life produces in our lives and this is why with Abraham I love that scripture he found us his heart faithful and you know Abraham look at his heart it only increased it became more visible as time went on now remember when Abraham's Divine commentary brother Ronnie mentioned this we're speaking on Sunday as well in the grace of God when God wrote Abraham's commentary he never wrote all of Abraham's mistakes but he wrote he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God this is the testimony of Abraham's seed oh my that's my desire I I believe in my heart I believe that that I'm one of his don't you believe that and that's the desire that within its all when men are many times do we we hear it even in this time and day and age we're living in sometimes you know when things will you know we'll hear say well God looks on the heart but whatever is in the heart will come out so whatever comes out is what's in here right the scripture said man is not defiled by what's coming in man's defiled by what's already in him is that right so there that that's where the cleansing there of the heart but the thing foundest his heart faithful through everything they're every up through every down through everything he found us his heart faithful and faithfulness is being able to stand upon God's word and face to face with the word even when it takes to hide off our back even like Abraham when it was hard for him to separate from lot Hey listen lot wasn't some guy who was running around and running out here running out there remember Lord himself he was a penny but he was hindering the promise in Abraham's life and so God listen this Abraham cannot brag on this God allowed it to get tough tight and sticky to where Abraham realized this can't go on any longer if we could call up Abraham today he would say thank you Lord for allowing that situation it was hard it was hard to separate but I'm grateful that God gave me Grace to be able to see it for what it is I wonder how many times Abraham went to sleep and he made up in his mind I'm going to go tell a lot tomorrow I'm going to go do this I'm going to do that when tomorrow came here was lot again a lot at The Breakfast Table and everything else I'm gonna tell you what I'm going to tell a lot again everything seems I'll tell you what Lots really coming along a lot really seems really good and all of a sudden there would be something else come up but eventually Grace was given for Abraham to remain faithful to the promise so you understand when Abraham separated from lot it wasn't that lot was getting on his nerves it was that Abraham began to recognize this relationship is a hindrance to the promise that I've been given I tell you friends when we can evaluate things in that way with relationships and I'm talking about even with attitude with everything else and we can evaluate it how is this affecting the promise from coming to pass in my life the same with my heart be found faithful well your heart is found faithful if when we can stand on the word of God and when we're confronted with it we'll say Amen to the word of God and say Lord help me Lord strengthen Me Lord help me Lord Jesus that's to be faithful is that right I think as I come in here and Wednesday Thursday night after Thursday night and see different ones I mean it might seem like brother Samuel you should be preaching this on a Sunday this right here God knows when to give this I'm going to mean to sometimes I understand that people stream but I'm going to say this right now Friends The Rapture itself is for the faithful faithfulness is not based on our convenience we do not serve God on what's convenient because the Rapture itself is not going to be at a convenient hour are you with me the Bible says that day that he came in an hour when they expected him not I'll tell you why I come to church because I expect him to be here I expect him to I expect him to come I expect him to speak to my heart I expect him to deal with my life but the same there's ever times that you feel down or you feel weary or you're tired sure I do I feel tired many times matter of fact I felt really tired and we're in my body right now I just preached last night down there in Logan Ohio I felt weary I felt tired but you know what I know that just being here in his presence and to hear from him is worth more than anything else that ain't lifting you or me up friends but look is there a blessing in it there is a blessing in being faithful I think when I look across here on a Thursday night no we've come from you've come from your jobs you come from tools come from the week come from everything and here you are moving right through it and it's not easy your minds and things through the tolls of the week and you're sitting here and trying to press right through and say God I know you got something for me tonight your mind you've got tools you got cares that are upon your heart burdens that are on your heart you're weary you're tired from the 12s of the day I don't care if you're retired you fought Devils all day long is that right sometimes you fight tormenting spirits of sickness and here you are standing not to be seen but what is it is faithfulness I'm glad that he didn't say I can't carry the cross I can't go it's not convenient but I'm glad and surely the cross that I have to bear you have to bear it can never be compared with his cross yet he asked us and he spoke about our cross more than his own cross I say God let us find our heart faithful if our heart is out of line and anywhere let us find let us find our heart faithful oh God let me be faithful let it be said when it's all said and done the desire of my heart is that God can say he's faithful brother Samuel that guy had a lot of shortcomings yeah but his heart was faithful her oh she had she had there was a lot of shortcomings about her life but she was faithful faithful yeah because see all you saw was maybe right here but you didn't see her heart moving back in and that's why you're still standing you understand me that's why you're still standing is because of his faithfulness in your heart let's pray father Lord God how we thank you for your mercy Lord thank you for your goodness Lord and Lord Jesus truly Lord you are faithful Lord God I never I could never be able to look at it or try to compare neither do you ask us to try to somehow compare to your faithfulness but Lord God the desire is is that Lord God you bring forth of faithfulness in our lives Lord as we've been looking at this for some time where job could say my foot hath held his steps it's kept his way this was not the first trial that job of first test this was a very big one that job had been through many tests and trials before oh God I pray Lord Jesus job himself was a heart that was faithful Lord that you found faithful as a matter of fact the reason that trial then that test had come because you were bragging to Satan about job of what a perfect and upright man that he was Lord God you were bragging on one of your children one of your sons I think of it you didn't brag on his wife that way you didn't brag on his children but you bragged on him and Lord God there was a faithfulness there was an entrustment it shows us Lord that every test or trial that you permit to come our way it's because the Lord is your Prophet would tell us you got confidence in US Lord God there's things the Lord that you see it's so clear over time as we go on what you see in US is so much deeper than what we can see Lord by Faith Lord God is I believe and I believe God's standing here there's other believers that can witness with me Lord God we believe Lord that we are a part of you we're a part of that word we can Lord give witness to your working in our life of how that you have changed this Lord from Death unto life the Lord Jesus we find ourselves looking to you which we should we're made Lord as sheep to be dependent upon you Our Shepherd we find no identity in anywhere else Lord there's nothing that can make our life clear or the mystery of it outside of you Lord now father you know Lord got it our needs Lord even here tonight Lord you know our hearts Lord father I pray that God that you would help us Lord I want to be found faithful Lord I don't want to be Lord I don't want to be faithful according to my own thoughts I want to be faithful according to your word I don't want to be like Lord God that like that story many times we hear and I don't mean to the Lord say something to be light but it's like that story of The Emperor's New Clothes he was so psyched out by a person who came to deceive him and he walked around with no clothes on whatso all but yet he was made to think he had clothes on Lord God we do not want to think in our own thoughts but Lord to recognize Lord that the word declares in our life faithfulness Lord and it also shows us our weak places Lord and that in itself is also to display faithfulness in our hearts what will we do when we are confronted with our weak places Lord because that's not one area that's comfortable to us when weak places are pointed out the world out there calls it constructive criticism when to be able to pick this apart to try to make you better but Lord I'm glad you don't come to tear us down to leave us make us feel like nothing but you come Lord God by your word and father is we're beholding your character your nature your life your person Lord God is we're beholding you Lord it challenges Our Lives oh God I want to I want to match what I'm beholding I want my life to match this word more than anything Lord God Lord God I want my weak places Lord I I want to surrender them to you Lord I don't want to make it s for them I want to surrender them to you Lord so that you can pour your strength in there Lord God oh granted Lord I don't want to make excuses for him we don't want to make excuses but Lord God help us Lord to submit and surrender our weaknesses and our weak places and those to you Lord God that you might pour yourself in those areas because as your Prophet said you pour yourself in and then use yourself to accomplish the job oh God help us not to complain Lord God for the weaknesses sometimes we get so caught up within that Lord looking at our weaknesses looking at our frailties but Lord God the weaknesses and the frailties are only opportunities for the greatness of God to be made manifest in our life help us to see it that way Lord I'm asking you Lord help me to see it that way help us Lord but God for when we can see it that way that Lord that we can submit ourselves even more fully to you to realize the Lord that we can't do nothing without you we want to be found faithful Lord I believe Lord of those that when it says that they will return with you coming back from the marriage supper of the Lamb they that would ride with you are called The Chosen and faithful they're called that if there's one thing Lord that we want to be called I want to be called faithful I want to be called faithful you call Moses faithful Nehemiah broke into that inspiration and said you found us Abraham's heart faithful Lord God if there's nothing else that can be said about us let it be said they were faithful in all that I placed in their life they never deviated they never backed up sometimes they maybe have went a long time they went around things tried to bypass this tried to pass that but when it all came said and done they came to a faithfulness to stand in every aspect of the word and allow the word to mold them help us Lord help us that the Loyalty of our heart can beat this material out Lord God help us Lord I pray in Jesus name amen you loving tonight you know it's just it's simple little things we look at Abraham we look at each one of them and say wow if I can be mentioned like them you can be remember what God values is faithfulness whatever that God has revealed to you the word that God has given to you you realize even in one of the parts within scripture we didn't get to it tonight but one of the very first Parts in scripture where it speaks of how that God is faithful for he is faithful the very next scriptures goes into forsaking not to assemble yourselves together sometimes the things that we can look at is though ah that don't matter that much but it doesn't matter that much to who it matters to God [Music] I wonder if we would take that kind of an outlook on any other promise now it don't matter that much whether a Rapture comes or not I don't think it matters too much whether or not God still heals the sick I don't think it matters too much whether God still pours out the Holy Ghost it does matter and if it matters for every one of them promises he's faithful to fulfill all his word say God help me help me help me oh my don't you love him he's here he's here to minister to our lives to bring about that faithfulness in our lives there's things that I'm sure you can look at in your life right now I can look at and if God tarries we will look back and look back to even this night and say my God's brought me from there to where I am now maybe certain things that you struggle with or this or that but then God through him by submitting to his word him shaping and molding your heart what is that that's faithfulness and it brings about faithful reactions and you can look back and say God you brought me from there to where I am now what is that that's Faithfully giving ourselves to God I tell you or me I can never make out of myself what God can but if I can just let go and let God have his way God can bring forth amen God bless you tonight let's stand brother Brian lead us amen and amen you are my refuge You Are My
