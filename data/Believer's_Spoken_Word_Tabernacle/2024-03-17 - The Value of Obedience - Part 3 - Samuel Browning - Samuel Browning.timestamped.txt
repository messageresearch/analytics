[43:07] amen amen God bless you thank you
[43:09] musician song leader um I want to go to
[43:13] Ruth chapter 2 uh once again
[43:17] and
[43:21] um as you're turning there in Ruth
[43:23] chapter 2
[43:25] I I I want to continue to speak on this
[43:28] thought on the value of obedience and
[43:32] throughout this book of Ruth as we look
[43:36] at
[43:36] it you know when the reality if when you
[43:41] read the the Bible if you if you don't
[43:43] see Jesus Christ in every
[43:47] verse then you need to go back and read
[43:49] it
[43:50] again and when you look in the Book of
[43:52] Ruth very small book but it's a book
[43:55] that actually it speaks of so
[43:57] beautifully of the redeeming work of the
[44:00] Lord Jesus
[44:02] Christ it's not a doesn't have a lot of
[44:05] chapters in
[44:06] it but it has the significance of what
[44:10] Christ himself God becoming one of us in
[44:14] order to fully redeem us and when we
[44:19] look in upon this thought that ask the
[44:21] Lord would just grace us this morning
[44:23] once again on that value of obedience I
[44:27] believe I believe I'm a witness and I
[44:29] believe you could testify there is Great
[44:31] Value in obedience to the things of God
[44:35] there is Great Value in Ruth chapter 2
[44:39] and verse one and Naomi had a Kinsman of
[44:43] her husbands a mighty man of wealth of
[44:46] the family of IMC and his name was Boaz
[44:50] I want you to notice how that chapter
[44:52] opens this is the focus then verse two
[44:56] the Moab then Ruth the moabit said unto
[44:58] Naomi Let Me Now go to the field and
[45:01] glean ears of corn after him and whose
[45:03] sight I shall find Grace and she said
[45:06] unto her go my daughter and she went and
[45:09] came and gleaned in the field after the
[45:12] Reapers and her hap was to light on a
[45:16] part of the field belonging unto Boaz
[45:19] who was of the Kindred of ELC Lord now
[45:23] as Believers we don't believe that
[45:25] anything's by chance the Bible says that
[45:28] the footsteps of the righteous are
[45:30] ordered of the Lord Jacob came to bethl
[45:34] and he didn't see any significance to it
[45:36] but God had a significance and God met
[45:40] Jacob there at bethl and what just
[45:42] became a a stopping place to get some
[45:44] rest it became a place for God to make
[45:47] himself known to Jacob so there's we're
[45:50] we're not here by chance it's it's by
[45:53] Design even as we're gathered here this
[45:56] morning were here by the design of
[45:59] almighty God verse four and Boaz came
[46:02] from Bethlehem and said unto the Reapers
[46:04] the Lord be with you and they answered
[46:06] him the Lord bless thee then said Boaz
[46:10] unto his servant that was set over the
[46:12] Reapers whose damsel is this and the
[46:16] servant that was set over the Reapers
[46:18] answered and said it is the moabi is
[46:21] damsel that came back with Naomi out of
[46:24] the country of Moab and she said I pray
[46:28] you let me glean and gather after the
[46:31] Reapers among the sheath so she came and
[46:34] hath continued even from the morning
[46:37] until now that she carried a little in
[46:40] the house then said Boaz unto Ruth
[46:43] hearest thou not my daughter go not to
[46:47] glean in another field neither go from
[46:50] hence but abide here fast by my maidens
[46:55] let thine eyes be on the field that they
[46:58] do reap and go Thou after them have not
[47:02] I charged the young men that they shall
[47:04] not touch thee and when thou art of
[47:07] thirst go unto the vessels and drink of
[47:10] that which the young men have drawn amen
[47:14] may God bless you and bless the reading
[47:16] of the word as you're being
[47:19] seated you you can look in your even in
[47:22] your Bible and look at the headings
[47:25] above every chapter there in the Book of
[47:27] Ruth four chapters and you can see that
[47:30] there are four parts the prophet would
[47:33] lay that out over and over again and
[47:36] showing us those four stages where of
[47:39] the decision that Ruth had made and then
[47:43] she comes into the land and begins to
[47:46] labor then it moves into chapter three
[47:49] you can see there where it's to enter
[47:51] into rest and then there is the full
[47:55] reward that would come with it and we
[47:59] recognize that in the time in the hour
[48:01] that we are living in and that we we
[48:04] recognize that we are we're not just in
[48:07] a place of deciding although everyone
[48:09] has to make a decision we're not just in
[48:13] a time of of laboring although we do
[48:16] have to labor the Bible says to enter
[48:18] into his rest there has to be a desire
[48:22] that we are just yielding to his leading
[48:24] remember the prophet tells us that when
[48:27] you have need of healing he said if
[48:29] you'll just let the Holy Spirit he will
[48:31] take you to your healing he said you
[48:33] need the Holy Ghost he said let him take
[48:36] you to the Holy Spirit see God knows the
[48:40] way we you and I don't know the way but
[48:42] it's the whole the whole part of it if
[48:44] there's one word that we can even say
[48:46] once again to put before us it's
[48:49] yielding to his voice it's yielding to
[48:53] him it's Allowing God to have the right
[48:55] away and that and that's part of
[48:57] obedience and I want you to notice that
[48:59] as we look at this here that Ruth she
[49:03] starts out and she's you know she's come
[49:05] over into to make her decision and she's
[49:08] now entered into the fields and she
[49:11] enters into these fields and she begins
[49:13] to glean because there's a need for food
[49:16] but there is fruit the the Bible tells
[49:19] us that they returned because they heard
[49:22] that there was bread in the land of
[49:26] Israel it was the time of The Barley
[49:28] Harvest and to understand that time of
[49:30] The Barley Harvest that is a type of
[49:33] that of Pentecost it's a type of the
[49:36] grain that went in the ground and is
[49:39] raised up again it's come to maturity
[49:42] and now that grain is to give life and
[49:46] to see that how that you and I by the
[49:49] grace of God not because of any of our
[49:51] merits we as Gentiles Paul goes through
[49:54] this all the way through the book of
[49:55] Romans that if it had not been for the
[49:58] blinding of the Jews and that's only for
[50:01] a period of time God had already in his
[50:04] mind to take a a people among the
[50:08] Gentiles for his name's sake like Joseph
[50:11] going down into Egypt this mystery
[50:13] remember Paul would write of it through
[50:15] the book of Ephesians he would write of
[50:17] it in Colossians and how that God had
[50:20] given him that mystery and that mystery
[50:23] was of how that God was going to bring
[50:26] in Gentile bride that part that was
[50:28] hidden yet there were scriptures that
[50:30] was laid all the way through the Old
[50:32] Testament of how that God would speak of
[50:35] this through the book of Isaiah and
[50:37] Hosea habac on and on these these
[50:39] promises laid there in the scriptures
[50:41] and let me just say this if there's a
[50:43] promise that God has made he made it
[50:46] with someone in mind and he knew that
[50:50] there would be somebody that that
[50:52] promise when his presence would go over
[50:55] that that promise would stand hand out
[50:57] to them and they would reach down and
[50:59] they would take that promise into
[51:02] themselves now when we think of this of
[51:05] gleaning and and coming into the field
[51:07] here she is she's gleaning for food and
[51:10] you know she's gleaning in the promises
[51:13] of which uh we can say it in this way
[51:15] that the the the Jewish church when they
[51:18] the Jews when they themselves when they
[51:20] were blinded and we recognize that there
[51:23] were promises that were left in that of
[51:25] redemption and God now opening and
[51:29] bringing in the Gentiles remember Paul
[51:32] when he was uh a commissioned and called
[51:35] by God that God said I had chosen thee
[51:38] to be a vessel and to Bear my name
[51:42] before the
[51:44] Gentiles to to turn them away from
[51:46] darkness and unto the light so God would
[51:49] use a vessel here Paul would would stand
[51:52] there and begin to rehearse the promises
[51:55] of God remember as Gentiles we were not
[51:58] even included uh as far as written out
[52:01] in that of the adoption and everything
[52:03] that was written in the the promises
[52:06] that pertain to to to to Redemption and
[52:09] and that of a redeemer but you know
[52:11] listen as far as among the Jews they
[52:14] were uh looking for this there they they
[52:17] were they knew these words they knew
[52:19] these promises but yet in reality there
[52:23] were only a handful that was actually
[52:26] looking looking for them in the right
[52:28] way when the Lord Jesus came his church
[52:32] was about eight people you had Simeon in
[52:35] the temple you had you had uh H Anna the
[52:39] blind prophetess just a few because the
[52:42] religious of that day who knew the
[52:45] promises yet when he stood there they
[52:48] called him
[52:49] [Applause]
[52:50] beela they didn't want anything to do
[52:53] with him and to know that here then how
[52:57] we enter in and this is what I want to
[52:59] come into this morning as as Ruth begins
[53:01] to enter in she's following under her
[53:04] decision and she's laboring and she's
[53:07] made a decision to go with Naomi just
[53:10] like a life can make a decision to begin
[53:13] to serve the Lord and listen if God
[53:16] doesn't deal with your heart then you
[53:19] know there's nothing that we can do uh
[53:21] you know God's not let me just tell you
[53:23] like this God is not in the business of
[53:25] making any
[53:27] afraid to where you you you walk around
[53:29] and you're afraid of him that that's not
[53:31] the fear of the Lord uh that's not the
[53:34] objective but God's desire is that you
[53:37] would come to trust him that you would
[53:40] love him he he wants to make himself
[53:43] known to you all along the way so you
[53:46] can have confidence in every promise not
[53:49] only that you are standing in but he
[53:52] will build your faith for the promise
[53:54] that you are to lay hold upon on next
[53:58] she was gleaning promises maybe in this
[54:00] field she was gleaning Promises at this
[54:03] time when she came in there was Promises
[54:05] of healing there was Promises of Grace
[54:08] there was Promises of Deliverance now
[54:11] listen there are many that can glean in
[54:13] the field for healing for grace and for
[54:17] deliverance and never come to glean the
[54:20] promises of redemption that's right when
[54:24] I'm talking about the promises of
[54:26] redemption
[54:27] I'm talking about where it becomes that
[54:30] we become United with him our Kinsman
[54:34] and to recognize something deeper than
[54:37] just the field we're in but to recognize
[54:40] whose field it is and to recognize what
[54:44] he is able to do for me and move in my
[54:48] life that will give me a Grace that'll
[54:51] move from just me laboring and trying to
[54:54] work everything out to I can come to a
[54:57] place of
[55:00] rest so we want to see that this chapter
[55:03] opens with the announcement it opens
[55:06] with the announcement of she has a a
[55:08] Kinsman that is a mighty man of wealth
[55:11] which that word means of Valor he's a
[55:13] mighty man of Valor he's a near Kinsman
[55:16] and as he as this is made known notice
[55:20] that's becomes the focus you know when
[55:22] God wants anything to uh to be known for
[55:25] us and what he wants our attention to be
[55:28] on God's very clear about it God will
[55:31] set the direction of what he wants us to
[55:34] be focused on you know this is why you
[55:36] can't run a race if you're looking here
[55:39] if you're looking there or you're
[55:40] looking behind you you've got the Bible
[55:42] says looking unto
[55:45] Jesus the author and the finisher of our
[55:48] faith yes sir because there's a lot of
[55:51] distractions that can try to take our
[55:54] eyes and our attention away and let me
[55:56] just tell you it only takes one moment
[55:58] of
[56:01] distraction and the enemy will use any
[56:03] tactic you can't listen he knows how
[56:05] we're made
[56:07] up he knows the things and listen I I'm
[56:10] talking even deeper than when it comes
[56:12] to that of even just sin he knows of
[56:14] certain things of how that we're made up
[56:17] of things that can even pull on our
[56:19] heart
[56:21] strings but let me tell you it ought to
[56:24] be such a resolve within your heart that
[56:27] I'm going to serve God I'm going to
[56:29] esteem like job said esteem his word
[56:33] above my necessary food that's right I
[56:36] want to serve God I I don't want to just
[56:38] know parts and bits and but I want to I
[56:41] want to have an assurance and everything
[56:43] that I'm doing I I want his word to be
[56:46] fully preeminent in my life and my heart
[56:49] I want it to rain supremely in my
[56:52] life now let me just I I read a little
[56:56] bit of this last week and I want to just
[56:58] start in here where the Prophet picks
[57:01] this up and he'll he'll refer to this in
[57:03] many places in the message in regards to
[57:05] this what n what what um uh that Boaz
[57:10] has said to Ruth about abiding here in
[57:12] this field by my maidens and let your
[57:16] eyes be on the field and reap after them
[57:18] and there's refreshment for you when you
[57:20] get weary there's refreshment amen yes
[57:24] that's good let me just say this to you
[57:26] there there is refreshment in the house
[57:28] of God Amen there is refreshment that's
[57:31] already been provided for you and
[57:35] I amen when you feel like you're getting
[57:38] weary it's a time of refreshment it's a
[57:41] moment oh God I need refreshment but
[57:44] listen don't wait till you get
[57:47] parched don't wait till you're almost
[57:50] completely dehydrated stay let me just
[57:53] tell you the words of the Prophet strive
[57:56] to live continually in the life of God
[58:01] strive to stay in the spirit of
[58:06] Revival that's overcoming
[58:09] life now brother B says it like this he
[58:12] said he went over there to her and he
[58:14] said now look don't leave this field out
[58:17] of redeeming Redemption he said don't
[58:19] you leave this field that's the way it
[58:21] is stay put look stay where you are
[58:24] every man that's born of the spirit of
[58:25] God when he's set in Christ his eyes is
[58:29] on Calvary right in the middle of the
[58:31] road if he's just now watch how he goes
[58:33] now if he's just a little bit emotional
[58:36] first thing you know he'll work out here
[58:38] to over this side he'll become a fanatic
[58:40] if he don't watch if he's just a little
[58:43] starchy educated he'll work over on this
[58:45] side becoming cold stiff starchy and
[58:48] take all the spirit out of him if the
[58:50] devil can't keep you from seeing the
[58:52] truth he'll push you off of the deep end
[58:55] with it yeah amen how many know in the
[58:58] scripture Isaiah 35 said that there is a
[59:03] way or a highway and in the middle of
[59:06] that Highway there's a way if we're not
[59:08] walking the Highway of Holiness that
[59:10] ain't the word the word said there's a
[59:12] highway and there would be a way in the
[59:15] middle of that
[59:16] Highway any good road the middle of that
[59:19] road is what's raised up true a road
[59:23] does not cave in like this you know I'm
[59:26] talking about I'm talking about a road
[59:27] out here that road is made so that the
[59:30] water will wash off of the road it'll go
[59:34] to this ditch or it'll go to that ditch
[59:37] and this is why it's important of
[59:39] staying in the middle in the center of
[59:41] the road and let me say this to you
[59:43] there's a lot of truth but remember he
[59:46] is the
[59:49] truth he must be the absolute of your
[59:53] life it must become to to where he's the
[59:57] focus not anybody else not anybody
[59:59] else's feelings not anybody let me just
[1:00:02] tell you something I don't even care how
[1:00:04] long the longest time that you've got
[1:00:06] somebody that you know that's serving
[1:00:08] God your eyes should never be upon
[1:00:11] somebody
[1:00:12] else that's good because you get the
[1:00:15] following somebody else that can lead
[1:00:17] you right
[1:00:19] away you keep your eyes on Christ am I
[1:00:23] don't care if it's father mother
[1:00:25] grandmother grandfather you keep your
[1:00:27] eyes on
[1:00:29] Christ remember if you respect man above
[1:00:33] God God will hold you
[1:00:35] accountable but the Bible said let every
[1:00:38] man's word action deed be a lie and let
[1:00:41] God's word be the
[1:00:43] truth are you hearing me I believe there
[1:00:46] ought to be examples right examples in
[1:00:48] the house of God I believe that
[1:00:49] everybody that attends here and you call
[1:00:52] this your home church we ought to live
[1:00:54] like it not just in the house of God we
[1:00:56] ought to live like it
[1:00:59] outside come on now we're not here just
[1:01:03] to show up we're here that God would
[1:01:06] mold and shape and make and mold Our
[1:01:09] Lives to be real images of Christ I want
[1:01:13] you to notice what what the prophet's
[1:01:15] just saying right here and he'll say it
[1:01:16] over and over you realize this if the
[1:01:19] man's a little bit emotional or he'll
[1:01:21] say if he's a little bit starchy you
[1:01:23] know what that is it's still a lot of
[1:01:25] self
[1:01:27] and let me just tell you something we
[1:01:29] can have listen to me now we can have
[1:01:31] our own preferences about things but you
[1:01:35] nor me has the right or we we could have
[1:01:38] a right but you don't want me preaching
[1:01:41] my opinions right that's right you don't
[1:01:44] want me preaching my opinions you might
[1:01:46] have your thoughts I might have my
[1:01:47] thoughts but that's not what we're to
[1:01:49] preach we are to preach the word of God
[1:01:52] the message of the hour amen right amen
[1:01:57] amen and that's why when someone says
[1:01:59] well I think I think this well okay
[1:02:02] let's look at it in the word of God Amen
[1:02:05] let's look at it well I heard no I'm not
[1:02:07] interested in so and so I'm asking you
[1:02:09] do you got a quote for me that's right
[1:02:11] amen do you got a scripture I don't want
[1:02:13] somebody else's idea listen if God
[1:02:16] seeing it's so important for you and I
[1:02:18] he has not left us Here Helpless without
[1:02:21] one thing lacking God has supplied it
[1:02:25] all that we have need of who am I
[1:02:28] talking about I'm talking about our
[1:02:31] Kinsmen God has not delivered us a word
[1:02:34] that would leave us up and down and in
[1:02:36] and out and sin and and lives filled and
[1:02:39] bound that's not how God has left us God
[1:02:42] has left us with a sure word
[1:02:46] am my my my notice he says stay put he
[1:02:51] talked about how the Pentecostals got
[1:02:53] off go to the next paragraph it says
[1:02:55] Don't Run Away way stay in Christ don't
[1:02:58] go after gifts and everything stay with
[1:03:00] a giver God will take care of the gifts
[1:03:03] stay there yes stay in the field oh I
[1:03:06] need to go talk to this brother I need
[1:03:08] to see if God's got a word from me let
[1:03:10] me tell you something God sent a prophet
[1:03:12] already Hallelujah are you hearing me
[1:03:16] God's already sent his word and that
[1:03:18] when God came and he moved through the
[1:03:20] ministry of Malachi 4 it was to bring
[1:03:23] the reality to you and I that what we
[1:03:26] have need of is the word of God and God
[1:03:28] himself is standing here with a full
[1:03:31] absolute
[1:03:32] Hallelujah you say why because people
[1:03:35] will start running after this and
[1:03:36] running after this and I got to have
[1:03:38] this man to pray for me and this man's
[1:03:39] got to say a word over me this let me
[1:03:41] tell you something there's one gift to a
[1:03:43] [Applause]
[1:03:45] generation come on friends every one of
[1:03:48] those nine spiritual gifts us to be
[1:03:52] judged are you hearing me that's the
[1:03:54] word of God
[1:03:56] no dream should be spoken unless it's
[1:03:59] been judged
[1:04:00] Hallelujah that's God's word hallelujah
[1:04:03] I don't care who it is it's got to come
[1:04:06] in line with God's word and if there's
[1:04:08] anything that says well that's too tight
[1:04:10] the prophet said what about me when I
[1:04:12] stand on the
[1:04:14] platform and have to give thus sayith
[1:04:16] the Lord
[1:04:17] afterwards brother Samuel you what are
[1:04:19] you saying I'm saying keep your eyes on
[1:04:21] Christ right that's what Boaz has was
[1:04:27] reminding her stay put don't be pulled
[1:04:30] here pulled
[1:04:32] here and sometimes those things are are
[1:04:35] in a way people have good intentions
[1:04:38] people can have they have good
[1:04:39] intentions of wanting to see a move of
[1:04:41] God but listen you don't have to create
[1:04:43] a move of
[1:04:46] God are you hearing me a move of God is
[1:04:49] not something that's created we got to
[1:04:50] travel to some locality here and no no
[1:04:53] the the move that God has is is a move
[1:04:56] inside of your
[1:05:00] life stay in the field just look at it
[1:05:03] stay in the
[1:05:04] field stay there you know God will take
[1:05:07] care of it remember remember how many
[1:05:08] people would say when they'd come to the
[1:05:10] Lord and brother Bram should we start
[1:05:12] seeking gifts brother Ram said don't do
[1:05:13] that he said you end up a stuffed shirt
[1:05:16] he wasn't speaking against the gifts
[1:05:18] he's letting the people know don't go
[1:05:20] seeking for
[1:05:23] something just stay right in Christ love
[1:05:26] him I'm just going to tell you from my
[1:05:28] heart I didn't seek to be a minister of
[1:05:30] the Gospel I didn't want to be a
[1:05:32] minister of the
[1:05:34] Gospel Lord knows I sure didn't want to
[1:05:36] be a
[1:05:38] pastor I didn't ask for
[1:05:41] that but what I my heart's desire I was
[1:05:44] just happy serving God in the capacity
[1:05:47] that he called me if he had never asked
[1:05:49] me to preach the gospel I would have
[1:05:51] been just as
[1:05:53] happy but you see what whatever God has
[1:05:56] for you to do that's why it's to stay
[1:05:59] put in the field and God will bring
[1:06:01] everything out in its time we don't have
[1:06:04] to go seeking searching pressing
[1:06:09] reaching oh my notice he said stay here
[1:06:13] now until night till the sun's gone down
[1:06:16] and when Christ baptizes you with the
[1:06:17] Holy Spirit stay put right in Christ
[1:06:20] that first love is in your heart never
[1:06:24] let it get cold just keep loving him and
[1:06:27] move
[1:06:28] on now this principle of staying
[1:06:32] put it's always been in God's program
[1:06:35] God will give his
[1:06:37] word and it's a testing
[1:06:40] time it's whether or not that the people
[1:06:44] are going to be obedient to his word now
[1:06:48] in the beginning clear clear back in
[1:06:51] heaven remember when God created all the
[1:06:55] Angels Lucifer was part of
[1:06:59] that but remember he was an awful good
[1:07:02] guy in the beginning he was God's
[1:07:04] right-hand man that's the Book of
[1:07:06] Ezekiel is that right he was I mean he
[1:07:09] was he was right there tight with God as
[1:07:12] a matter of fact the scripture calls it
[1:07:14] in Ezekiel Thou Art the anointed chuban
[1:07:17] that
[1:07:19] coverthe was God's right-and man to
[1:07:24] Fellowship but
[1:07:26] Lucifer begin to desire something more
[1:07:32] than was
[1:07:33] present he wanted a more beautiful
[1:07:37] program he wanted something that he
[1:07:40] thought was better remember the Bible
[1:07:43] said thou was perfect until the day
[1:07:45] iniquity was found in thine
[1:07:48] heart what was iniquity to know what's
[1:07:51] right and not do
[1:07:53] it the greatest thing he could have done
[1:07:55] at that time was to abandon
[1:07:58] that but he couldn't stay put with the
[1:08:01] program and the Bible says he
[1:08:04] led Angels
[1:08:06] astray the Bible said there were Angels
[1:08:09] who kept not their first estate that's
[1:08:13] now let me just bring it down to what we
[1:08:14] call those angels
[1:08:16] demons they're Spirits right are you
[1:08:20] hearing me absolutely they fail they
[1:08:23] keep their same order and their
[1:08:24] hierarchy even in the fall we could read
[1:08:26] of that in the Book of Daniel but
[1:08:28] Lucifer led a
[1:08:30] rebellion because he wasn't content or
[1:08:33] to stay put in the garden when God gave
[1:08:37] his word to that of his children in the
[1:08:40] beginning here Satan makes his approach
[1:08:44] he takes a a a vessel that we know as
[1:08:47] the serpent which was the Beast it says
[1:08:52] the Beast more subtle than any beast of
[1:08:55] the field they wanting a snake crawling
[1:08:56] on the
[1:08:57] ground but to recognize that how he used
[1:09:01] this instrumentality and he comes to Eve
[1:09:04] and what's he trying to do he's trying
[1:09:06] to pull her away from the word let me
[1:09:08] tell you something if you can be talked
[1:09:11] into it you can be talked out of
[1:09:14] it if you can be shouted into it you can
[1:09:17] be shouted out of it it's got to be more
[1:09:20] than a shout it's got to be more than an
[1:09:23] emotion it's got to be Jesus J
[1:09:26] Christ well I don't shout like so and so
[1:09:29] maybe you're not a
[1:09:32] shouter but if you're not a shouter
[1:09:34] don't condemn somebody else who
[1:09:36] is just stay in the middle of the roadl
[1:09:40] and don't try to be a referee for
[1:09:41] everybody
[1:09:44] else come on Friends God's big enough to
[1:09:47] take care of his
[1:09:50] church he don't need a dozen Cooks in
[1:09:52] the kitchen and let me just tell you
[1:09:54] something I ain't the one who's the cook
[1:09:56] anyhow I just serve what he
[1:10:01] prepares is that all
[1:10:03] right now notice how that Eve herself
[1:10:07] she would told they were told just stay
[1:10:09] with the
[1:10:10] word God will bring it to pass in his
[1:10:14] season right how many times through the
[1:10:17] message now this may not have struck you
[1:10:20] but it strikes me when I to go all the
[1:10:22] way through the message there things
[1:10:24] that really perk up to me throughout
[1:10:26] even the message and I hear now one of
[1:10:28] the reason I believe even as a pastor is
[1:10:30] that God will alert me to these things
[1:10:32] where we're reminded over and over
[1:10:35] through the message that when the word
[1:10:38] has come be
[1:10:41] patient don't try when you see something
[1:10:43] needs to be done the prophet will say
[1:10:46] don't try to reach out in your senses
[1:10:47] and do it now that's not only as a
[1:10:49] pastor that can come to you as a father
[1:10:52] and a
[1:10:53] mother it can come to you as a another
[1:10:55] brother or sister that sometimes in the
[1:10:57] midst of a situation we see we can
[1:11:00] become frustrated and we're wanting to
[1:11:02] correct it right but it's through our
[1:11:03] own
[1:11:04] senses we must be patient the Bible said
[1:11:07] wait on the Lord and He Shall renew thy
[1:11:10] strength wait I say on the Lord and be
[1:11:13] of a good courage and he will strengthen
[1:11:15] thine heart we're never wrong for
[1:11:19] waiting but I want you to think of it in
[1:11:21] this way how that here she was pulled
[1:11:24] away from God's
[1:11:26] presence because of one word it just
[1:11:30] started with one
[1:11:31] word when Satan came to her and said yay
[1:11:34] hath God said right God had already
[1:11:37] revealed himself as Lord
[1:11:40] God now you might think well what's one
[1:11:42] word got to do with it let me tell you
[1:11:44] the Bible says clear at the end of the
[1:11:46] book whosoever
[1:11:48] adds one
[1:11:50] word is that right or taketh away his
[1:11:54] part will be removed from The Book of
[1:11:56] Life and what will be added to him is
[1:11:59] the plagues of this book so that's why
[1:12:02] it matters of who it is and whose field
[1:12:05] you're
[1:12:07] in are you hearing me it matters whose
[1:12:10] field that you're
[1:12:13] in Hallelujah the field that goes on
[1:12:16] with the world right now oh they love
[1:12:18] the gleanings of Grace but it ain't
[1:12:20] Grace it's
[1:12:22] disgrace it lets people live any way
[1:12:24] they want want now
[1:12:27] churches that were at one time I tell
[1:12:30] you John Wesley would rebuke every one
[1:12:32] of them
[1:12:33] Methodist Luther would disown
[1:12:36] them having homosexual people standing
[1:12:39] in the
[1:12:41] platform but you know what listen it
[1:12:44] didn't start that way it started by
[1:12:46] deviating from by one
[1:12:49] word sin doesn't all of a sudden it
[1:12:53] starts with one word amen hallelujah and
[1:12:57] sometimes then people are left to wonder
[1:12:59] how did it get this way one word one
[1:13:01] word one word one word not one be not a
[1:13:05] sentence one word that's why it's
[1:13:07] important man shall not live by bread
[1:13:10] alone but by every word that proceedeth
[1:13:13] out of the mouth of
[1:13:17] god notice King in Genesis 4:16 he went
[1:13:21] out from the presence of the
[1:13:23] Lord right after here you have Abel and
[1:13:26] Cain that come forth both are coming to
[1:13:29] worship but Abel's coming by
[1:13:32] Revelation Cain is simply coming because
[1:13:35] he knows well it's time to worship I got
[1:13:38] to go worship and I'm going to I'm going
[1:13:40] to offer God all the best that I can do
[1:13:42] he's trying to work his way
[1:13:45] in to the economy of
[1:13:49] God but
[1:13:51] Abel who didn't ask but a
[1:13:55] who was of God he received a revelation
[1:13:59] from God and God spoke to Abel's heart
[1:14:03] and notice God come and confirmed what
[1:14:06] he spoke to Abel and when Cain saw it
[1:14:09] notice what God told Cain Cain knew what
[1:14:11] was
[1:14:12] right he saw what was right he saw the
[1:14:15] right
[1:14:17] field that's
[1:14:19] good but Cain stood right there in the
[1:14:22] presence of God and spit it right back
[1:14:23] in his face yes right and God told him
[1:14:27] if you worship like your brother if thou
[1:14:29] doest well shall won't thou also be
[1:14:31] accepted it didn't mean that Cain would
[1:14:33] have been anything different than what
[1:14:34] he was but if he would have just humbled
[1:14:36] himself to say I don't understand this
[1:14:39] but I know it's true I see what it's
[1:14:41] done for others I see it's changed this
[1:14:43] life I see it's changed this I know that
[1:14:46] no man can do these
[1:14:50] things but it was an
[1:14:53] Inc to Humble himself
[1:14:56] so the Bible said he went out from the
[1:14:57] presence of the
[1:14:59] Lord and He dwelt In the Land of
[1:15:02] wandering
[1:15:04] not I want you to listen what the
[1:15:06] prophet says right here in power of
[1:15:08] transformation he says Cain where he
[1:15:10] made his mistake first thing he did he
[1:15:14] made his mistake and there is where you
[1:15:16] will make a mistake and there is where
[1:15:19] I'll make the mistake the very minute we
[1:15:21] walk out of the presence of
[1:15:23] God go God's presence is his word being
[1:15:28] revealed God even think about it even
[1:15:30] how God will speak to your heart speak
[1:15:32] to my heart it matters in those moments
[1:15:36] what we
[1:15:37] do well Lord I've got a right and I've
[1:15:40] got this is the age of people's rights
[1:15:43] this the anointing upon this
[1:15:45] age we're going to be anointed one way
[1:15:47] or another I don't want to be Anointed
[1:15:49] with that I want to be Anointed with the
[1:15:51] spirit of God where I'm laying hold on
[1:15:53] my rights as a son of God has a daughter
[1:15:56] of God not I don't want I'm not
[1:15:58] interested in the rights out here
[1:15:59] because all those things that are out
[1:16:01] there it's Leading the People down this
[1:16:03] road to
[1:16:06] hell it's sad it's sad to see how that
[1:16:09] everything itself would move this is why
[1:16:12] the prophet would say it like this he
[1:16:14] would say you must always stay where the
[1:16:17] kingdom of God is and where the glory of
[1:16:19] God is pouring out stay where you can be
[1:16:22] spiritually fed day and night that's so
[1:16:26] you've got to stay there it's a battle
[1:16:28] notice notice the battle but God made
[1:16:31] provision he said I'll give you
[1:16:33] companions maidens I'll give you people
[1:16:36] that'll pray with you I give you people
[1:16:39] that'll encourage you along the way and
[1:16:41] I've spoken protection over your life
[1:16:44] the young men they might be able to chde
[1:16:46] you with their words but they can't
[1:16:48] touch you amen and I'll give you
[1:16:51] refreshment uhh that's great what more
[1:16:54] could you ask for through this
[1:16:56] journey he's provided what we
[1:17:00] need this is why even when the Lord
[1:17:03] Jesus John 665 here it was he said he
[1:17:06] said no man can come unto me except it
[1:17:09] were given unto him of my father and
[1:17:11] from that time notice John 666 from that
[1:17:14] time many of his disciples followers
[1:17:18] went back and walked no more with him
[1:17:21] then said Jesus well where did they go
[1:17:23] they didn't go back out to the bar
[1:17:26] right they went back to their churches
[1:17:29] they went back to the comfortable way
[1:17:31] because to walk with him was going to
[1:17:33] require a
[1:17:34] reproach it was going to require a
[1:17:37] change in their life amen come on
[1:17:40] friends just putting our name on a book
[1:17:43] don't require no
[1:17:45] change but when you meet him and he
[1:17:47] begins to deal with your life it doesn't
[1:17:50] become something of a mandate it becomes
[1:17:52] a love affair
[1:17:55] amen
[1:17:57] hallelujah here's what Jesus said verse
[1:18:00] 67 please don't go away from me please
[1:18:03] don't leave me I'll make you a charter
[1:18:06] member of my
[1:18:07] church I'll I'll do it what what
[1:18:10] position do you want what plaque you
[1:18:12] want your name on a brick outside no
[1:18:16] that ain't what the word made flesh God
[1:18:18] Almighty said he said will you go also
[1:18:21] to the
[1:18:23] 12 Jesus listen friends if flesh and
[1:18:27] blood cannot hang
[1:18:29] on it's got to be the word on the inside
[1:18:34] oh yes and let me just stop here for a
[1:18:36] minute if there's something inside of
[1:18:38] you that despite all your failures
[1:18:41] despite all your shortcomings despite
[1:18:44] all the times that you've fallen short
[1:18:46] but there's something inside of you that
[1:18:48] says Lord you are all that I have need
[1:18:53] of
[1:18:56] I tell you you're
[1:18:58] blessed you're
[1:19:01] blessed why brother Samuel look at me
[1:19:03] you're not to look at yourself you're to
[1:19:06] look at
[1:19:07] him that's why he makes himself real in
[1:19:11] our midst because our righteousness the
[1:19:14] Bible says it clear is nothing but
[1:19:17] filthy rags in the sight of
[1:19:20] God we needed a lamb we needed a king
[1:19:24] hman we needed a blood that could go to
[1:19:27] work for us we needed one that could go
[1:19:30] to battle and deal with the sin question
[1:19:33] in our
[1:19:36] life thank you Lord here Peter where are
[1:19:39] we going to
[1:19:42] go Peter didn't know everything right
[1:19:44] now but he knew this where are we going
[1:19:46] to go you alone have the words of
[1:19:49] eternal life what was he saying I know
[1:19:53] what field I'm men I may not understand
[1:19:57] everything I may not be gleaning
[1:19:59] everything right now but I ain't leaving
[1:20:02] this
[1:20:08] fil it ain't about how much you
[1:20:11] understand it's do you believe
[1:20:14] it Jesus never asked do you understand
[1:20:17] it he said Do you believe
[1:20:20] [Applause]
[1:20:22] it Hallelujah hallah
[1:20:26] and we believe and are sure that thou
[1:20:31] art the Christ the son of the Living
[1:20:34] God who spoke that that
[1:20:37] representation down on the inside of
[1:20:41] Peter it spoke out and said this is my
[1:20:48] field I'm staying right here in this
[1:20:51] field I'm not leaving I'm I'm not going
[1:20:55] nowhere else this might be a hard saying
[1:20:58] it might be a hard say something I need
[1:21:00] a lot to swallow but I know this is the
[1:21:05] [Applause]
[1:21:18] field that takes something de that takes
[1:21:20] something
[1:21:22] deeper it'd be like you going to
[1:21:24] somebody's house and they have your coat
[1:21:25] at the door and saying you ready to
[1:21:28] leave I know some of y'all been done
[1:21:31] that
[1:21:32] way probably feel like doing me that way
[1:21:35] sometimes when I come over but but let
[1:21:38] me tell you if you give somebody their
[1:21:39] coat they ain't going to feel like well
[1:21:40] my I really feel welcome about staying
[1:21:42] around Jesus look you want to
[1:21:44] go you want to go you see the word
[1:21:48] listen the word does not come to beg you
[1:21:51] and I that's right he don't beg us to be
[1:21:54] Believers he don't beg us to do
[1:21:57] right that ain't his way his program is
[1:22:02] he already knew you before the
[1:22:04] foundation of the world and he knows
[1:22:07] when this light comes across your
[1:22:09] pathway just like a seed that you take a
[1:22:12] seed you can lay concrete over that seed
[1:22:14] but if there's a seed on the inside that
[1:22:17] light will go to work that water will go
[1:22:19] to work on that seed and you can't feel
[1:22:21] comfortable underneath that concrete
[1:22:30] I wish I was twice my size this
[1:22:33] [Laughter]
[1:22:37] way yes sir this is why Jesus said he
[1:22:41] said John 8:31 if you
[1:22:44] continue in my word this is word abide
[1:22:48] remain keep walking in my word then
[1:22:52] you're my disciples in deed that means
[1:22:56] without any you're not just somebody
[1:22:58] who's followed me but now you have
[1:23:00] become my disciples indeed notice here
[1:23:03] here here he prophesies and you shall
[1:23:05] know the truth now he was the truth
[1:23:10] didn't he say that I am the truth the
[1:23:12] life the way but he's talking about a
[1:23:14] deeper relationship than just knowing
[1:23:17] him in the
[1:23:19] flesh but that that is going to be
[1:23:21] offered up the sacrifice and the truth
[1:23:24] the holy spirit is going to bring the
[1:23:27] truth present in your life that you're
[1:23:30] not the Son and Daughter of so and so
[1:23:33] you are always a son and daughter of God
[1:23:36] hallelujah the Lord Jesus stood in
[1:23:39] Pilot's Hall and he said I have come to
[1:23:41] Bear witness to the
[1:23:44] truth what was the truth deity
[1:23:48] tabernacled in
[1:23:50] flesh God dwelling in his people
[1:23:54] that's the
[1:24:02] truth so staying put don't mean just
[1:24:05] being
[1:24:07] complacent
[1:24:10] right
[1:24:16] well thank you Lord for saving my soul
[1:24:21] wow thank you Jesus it don't mean be
[1:24:25] complacent that's not what he said right
[1:24:29] he said keep your eyes on the field and
[1:24:33] where the reapers are at you stay close
[1:24:36] to my
[1:24:37] maidens and you follow the Reapers in
[1:24:39] the
[1:24:41] field and when you get a little bit you
[1:24:43] feel like a little bit of parched
[1:24:46] there's refreshment for
[1:24:48] you what is he saying to her what is he
[1:24:51] saying if you and I can draw from this
[1:24:54] God is more interested in you making it
[1:24:57] than you are
[1:25:01] hallu hallah come on now that's right
[1:25:04] because we're not it's not our desire
[1:25:06] it's God's desire that we're reflecting
[1:25:09] God has provided every provision along
[1:25:12] the way for you and I is that right this
[1:25:15] is why that even when they came there on
[1:25:18] the day of Pentecost they asked Peter
[1:25:20] what must we do to be saved see they
[1:25:23] realized something's going on here so
[1:25:26] Peter stands up as a spokesman Anointed
[1:25:29] with the spirit of God and announces to
[1:25:31] them this is the promise that God spoke
[1:25:35] in Joel 2 it's a promise that has laid
[1:25:38] in the field of God's word you see it's
[1:25:42] finding him of where he is remember when
[1:25:45] he arose the Bible said they went to the
[1:25:48] tomb and found him
[1:25:50] not right they were finding where he was
[1:25:55] but you got to know more than just where
[1:25:56] he was it's where is he and wherever he
[1:26:00] was where he is he'll still be the same
[1:26:04] cuz he which was which is and which is
[1:26:06] to come it's Jesus Christ the same
[1:26:09] yesterday today and forever he won't be
[1:26:11] a different Jesus now than what he was
[1:26:13] before he'll be the same almighty God
[1:26:16] doing the same
[1:26:18] thing is that right in other words when
[1:26:22] Peter said repent and you baptized in
[1:26:25] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ which
[1:26:28] we're going to do for a little add of
[1:26:29] here in just a little bit that was a
[1:26:32] prescription right be baptized in the
[1:26:34] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and listen
[1:26:37] he knew exactly what he was saying and
[1:26:40] not titles titles will never save
[1:26:42] you I got titles but I got a
[1:26:45] name daddy is not a name son is not a
[1:26:49] name husband is not a name he said the
[1:26:52] name of the father of the son and of the
[1:26:55] Holy Ghost and the name is the Lord
[1:26:57] Jesus
[1:27:01] Christ Hallelujah that's the
[1:27:04] truth that's letting you and I know the
[1:27:07] evening lights have come this is the
[1:27:15] field let me just drop this being in the
[1:27:18] right field is a wonderful thing it's
[1:27:22] important but the goal is more than just
[1:27:25] to be in the right
[1:27:27] field it's to be in him but you first
[1:27:31] got to recognize his field his word
[1:27:35] where he's placed his name you got to
[1:27:36] recognize where he
[1:27:39] is and when you recognize where he is
[1:27:42] you can say this is the field I don't
[1:27:45] understand at all but this is the field
[1:27:48] I'm not going nowhere I don't care what
[1:27:49] my friends do I don't care what so and
[1:27:51] so says I don't care who run who runs
[1:27:53] this way I don't care what somebody says
[1:27:55] I'm going to keep my eyes on the Lord
[1:27:57] Jesus what are you saying Brother Sam
[1:28:00] I'm not going to be moved and saying hey
[1:28:01] you need to come over here you need to
[1:28:03] come over here you need to come over
[1:28:05] here first of all let me just tell you
[1:28:07] something you know right away when
[1:28:09] people go to start pulling on you like
[1:28:10] that it's wrong God don't pull you he
[1:28:13] promised he'd lead
[1:28:15] you because if you follow somebody else
[1:28:18] is pulling guess what they become your
[1:28:22] absolute and let me tell you you
[1:28:24] something you get to lifting up a Man
[1:28:25] Too High God will let that man make a
[1:28:27] mistake to shake your confidence back
[1:28:29] where it needs to be because let me tell
[1:28:31] you God won't share his glory with no
[1:28:35] man is that right God won't share with
[1:28:37] no man so it's recognizing it's selling
[1:28:40] out to everything else and taking hold
[1:28:43] of that word let me just drop this
[1:28:45] scripture in 1 Samuel
[1:28:48] 15:22 notice here is
[1:28:50] Samuel speaking to to Saul and Saul
[1:28:54] remember he had went on and offered up
[1:28:57] offerings and sacrifice which was not in
[1:29:00] his authority to do it but I don't want
[1:29:01] to get caught on that story I want to
[1:29:03] get focused just and a reread this
[1:29:05] portion of the scripture of what God is
[1:29:07] saying about obedience hath the Lord as
[1:29:10] great Delight in burnt offerings and
[1:29:12] sacrifices as in obeying the voice of
[1:29:14] the Lord behold to obey is better than
[1:29:18] sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of
[1:29:22] Rams in other words
[1:29:24] of all of the works and everything that
[1:29:27] could be
[1:29:28] done but to fail to obey his
[1:29:32] voice is
[1:29:35] failure God will always lead us not only
[1:29:38] to obey the written word but when he
[1:29:42] speaks to us he will never speak to us
[1:29:45] to lead us outside of his
[1:29:49] word that's why when it's all said and
[1:29:53] done he had Comm committed all judgment
[1:29:55] unto his son talking about the
[1:29:58] word God is committed to lead you
[1:30:03] personally you believe that am look how
[1:30:07] important it is you might look in
[1:30:08] yourself and think I haven't done
[1:30:10] nothing for God what can I do let me
[1:30:14] tell you friends you may not you there
[1:30:16] may not be what you can see a gift in
[1:30:18] your life everybody has something to
[1:30:20] offer to
[1:30:22] God you don't have to try to find it
[1:30:25] just just stay in the presence of God
[1:30:27] God will bring it out in its
[1:30:29] time that's true but the greatest
[1:30:33] compliment is to obey his
[1:30:36] voice I wonder how many listen the Bible
[1:30:39] goes on to say for Rebellion is as the
[1:30:41] sin of Witchcraft and stubbornness is as
[1:30:43] iniquity and adultery I wonder when the
[1:30:45] prophet stood there and the godhead
[1:30:47] explained standing in that hotel room in
[1:30:50] Chicago and the spirit of God had
[1:30:52] already told him the room that they've
[1:30:54] tried to get they will not be able to
[1:30:57] get it'll be in a room that is this
[1:31:00] color and this will be the seating
[1:31:02] arrangement in that
[1:31:04] room standing right there because they
[1:31:07] wanted to trap
[1:31:08] him they wanted to trap him and try to
[1:31:11] trap that somehow that that that the
[1:31:14] teaching of the godhead was absolutely
[1:31:16] wrong but think about how God came in
[1:31:19] that
[1:31:20] room and the angel of the Lord stood
[1:31:22] right there and and the prophet said if
[1:31:24] I'm wrong you bring your Bible and come
[1:31:27] stand right here and disprove it
[1:31:29] quietest bunch of men you
[1:31:32] saw you know why thank God they had
[1:31:34] enough smarts than to not try to
[1:31:36] challenge it because you can't challenge
[1:31:38] the
[1:31:39] word are you hearing me now but think
[1:31:43] about it they many of them even when
[1:31:45] brother Deus got up now and told him
[1:31:47] said hey look look look look brother
[1:31:50] random told us yesterday where every one
[1:31:52] of you'd be sitting and you'd be wearing
[1:31:55] and we wouldn't get the original room
[1:31:58] and it'd be this room and this would be
[1:31:59] the color of
[1:32:00] it those men saw that witness they heard
[1:32:03] it and the presence of God came in there
[1:32:06] and they began to weep and every many of
[1:32:10] them I don't know the exact
[1:32:12] number promised we see it to be baptized
[1:32:16] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:32:18] we're going to come and be baptized not
[1:32:21] one of them showed up
[1:32:24] you want to know why here was a woman
[1:32:26] that raised up in spoken tongues in a
[1:32:29] different meeting and told them it's not
[1:32:32] necessary to be re-baptized what did
[1:32:36] they follow went off one side of the
[1:32:38] road they follow they put more on the
[1:32:41] gift oh well you know that's the spirit
[1:32:43] of God the spirit of God will never lead
[1:32:45] you outside of the
[1:32:48] word any spirit that wants to lead you
[1:32:51] out of the way is a spirit of error
[1:32:55] amen because the spirit of Truth is come
[1:32:59] to lead and guide us into all
[1:33:02] truth amen that's why the Bible said
[1:33:04] beloved 1 John chapter 4 beloved believe
[1:33:07] not every Spirit but try it see whether
[1:33:10] it be of God or not or what's your last
[1:33:13] name that ain't how you try
[1:33:16] it do they preach here that ain't how
[1:33:18] you try it you try it by the word and
[1:33:21] any gift that will not submit to be
[1:33:24] Tried by the word does not deserve to be
[1:33:27] heard that's right that's right
[1:33:30] ministerial n spiritual does not deserve
[1:33:34] to be heard because every gift is to be
[1:33:36] subject to the word of almighty God
[1:33:40] because if you can't be lead LED you
[1:33:43] can't lead that's
[1:33:45] right is that the word let's keep it in
[1:33:49] the right field listen we've got a
[1:33:51] promise in this field
[1:33:54] job was moved he knew there was a
[1:33:57] promise of
[1:33:58] Resurrection Abraham knew there was a
[1:34:01] promise of Resurrection there in the
[1:34:04] land of Israel he sold he bought that

[1:34:11] was buried there is that right Jacob was
[1:34:14] buried there Joseph was buried there you
[1:34:17] know what that cave of MPA was a type of
[1:34:20] it was a type of being buried in Christ
[1:34:26] it meant something what does this field
[1:34:29] mean to you it means
[1:34:31] Rapture it means
[1:34:35] Deliverance it means the change of my
[1:34:37] body H it means my
[1:34:40] Liberty it means my
[1:34:50] justification can I have just a few more
[1:34:52] minutes
[1:34:55] let's read these scriptures here Ruth
[1:34:57] chap
[1:34:59] 2:10 she fell on her
[1:35:01] face now this is after he spoke to her
[1:35:05] biding in the
[1:35:06] field walk with the maidens take picking
[1:35:09] up gleaning of the
[1:35:12] promises she's taking the promise of
[1:35:14] healing promise of Grace as we were
[1:35:16] saying hey
[1:35:17] look if somebody's taken up the promise
[1:35:20] of
[1:35:21] Salvation I'll shout with them
[1:35:25] y'all didn't hear me on that did you I
[1:35:27] said if somebody's gleaning the promise
[1:35:29] of Salvation I'll shout with
[1:35:31] them because I was once there I know
[1:35:34] there's more I know there's more to be
[1:35:37] glean but I can Rejoice with somebody
[1:35:40] that can glean salvation I can Rejoice
[1:35:44] that we can glean healing in this field
[1:35:48] oh brother Samuel healing is a minor
[1:35:50] thing except when you're
[1:35:52] sick there you go
[1:35:54] yes sir but that's a promise in this
[1:35:58] field
[1:35:59] deliverance and let me just tell you
[1:36:01] something salvation and deliverance is
[1:36:04] not just something we experience in our
[1:36:06] soul but through every trial through
[1:36:09] every test when things when
[1:36:11] encroachments of the enemy would want to
[1:36:14] come around our life he still lets us
[1:36:16] know I'm your savior I'm your
[1:36:20] deliverer listen the Hebrew children
[1:36:23] were not in sin but they were in a fiery
[1:36:25] furnace and he showed up and made it
[1:36:28] known I'm still your deliverer you know
[1:36:30] what they were doing they were gleaning
[1:36:32] that promise of
[1:36:33] Deliverance let me tell you what what we
[1:36:36] have need of God knows how to direct us
[1:36:37] to what we need to
[1:36:40] glean and what you might need to glean
[1:36:42] this service and so and so needs to
[1:36:44] glean this service might be entirely
[1:36:45] different but it all comes from him he's
[1:36:49] the source of all things of all that we
[1:36:50] have need
[1:36:52] of Noti she fell on her face and bowed
[1:36:56] herself to the ground and said why have
[1:36:59] I found Grace in thine eyes that thou
[1:37:01] should us take knowledge of me seeing I
[1:37:04] am a stranger remember she had no
[1:37:07] promises in the land of
[1:37:09] Israel as a matter of fact the last part
[1:37:12] of her name
[1:37:13] moabitas was not a very very good
[1:37:17] Heritage her whole nation was the
[1:37:20] product of incest right right are you
[1:37:23] hearing me she wore that over it was
[1:37:26] that Ruth the moabitas you say why would
[1:37:28] God still include that in the scripture
[1:37:30] the same reason he would include in the
[1:37:32] New Testament Rahab the Harlot not
[1:37:35] because he regarded her as a harlot but
[1:37:37] to remind you and I that there's no
[1:37:40] situation too deep too Bleak too dark
[1:37:43] that a God ever writes off his Redeeming
[1:37:45] Grace is greater than your sin it's
[1:37:48] greater than your
[1:37:50] doubt God can take a man that's a drug
[1:37:53] and clean him
[1:37:55] up God can take a man or a woman that's
[1:37:58] bound with sin and loose them by the
[1:38:02] power of the Holy
[1:38:05] Ghost he included that for you he
[1:38:08] included that for me not to shame
[1:38:12] them but to encourage you and
[1:38:22] I
[1:38:24] verse
[1:38:26] 11 Boaz answered and said unto her it
[1:38:30] hath been fully showed me all that thou
[1:38:33] Hast done unto thy mother-in-law since
[1:38:36] the death of thine husband and how thou
[1:38:38] Hast left thy father and thy mother and
[1:38:42] the land of thy Nativity look this is
[1:38:44] part of repentance repentance is just
[1:38:46] not acknowledging our wrong it's to turn
[1:38:49] from our
[1:38:51] ways that's part of repentance
[1:38:53] repentance is now you're going the de
[1:38:55] the opposite direction he's calling it
[1:38:58] out it's been fully revealed to me in
[1:39:00] other words your repentance I see it
[1:39:04] it's it's manifest through your
[1:39:06] life how thou Hast left thy father thy
[1:39:09] mother and the land of thy Nativity and
[1:39:11] art come unto a people which thou
[1:39:13] knewest not hitherto you realize she had
[1:39:15] to leave behind all of her moabit
[1:39:19] dressings all of her clothes that were
[1:39:22] moabit fashions right she had to take
[1:39:24] upon the Fashions of what God regarded
[1:39:28] in his word as F oh brother Samuel that
[1:39:31] that's not important that's a promise in
[1:39:32] God's word to glean now listen friends
[1:39:35] God will never sweep down over somebody
[1:39:37] and fill them with the Holy Ghost if
[1:39:39] they've got a resentful Spirit towards
[1:39:41] any
[1:39:42] promise oh I feel the anointing of the
[1:39:44] spirit of God it will never be a
[1:39:46] complete feeling because you know why
[1:39:48] the vessels got to be Sanctified first
[1:39:51] the spirit of God comes to work to
[1:39:54] loosen the holds upon our life oh I I
[1:39:57] need delivered from this I I need from
[1:39:59] this I really need the Holy Ghost now
[1:40:00] remember that what we need before the
[1:40:02] Holy Ghost is the sanctifying work of
[1:40:07] the
[1:40:08] blood are you hearing me that's why
[1:40:11] lives can receive a baptism of the Holy
[1:40:13] Ghost and it only lasts so long why
[1:40:16] flesh Spirit never gets down to the
[1:40:18] right reality
[1:40:19] right aren't you grateful that God in
[1:40:22] his Mercy helps us to see the right way
[1:40:24] you see what Satan would want to do he'd
[1:40:26] want to bring confusion to you you might
[1:40:27] have come into that place and my you
[1:40:29] felt the presence of God you felt oh oh
[1:40:32] brother Samuel nothing happened to me
[1:40:33] don't say that there is something that
[1:40:35] happened to you it's only God drawing
[1:40:37] upon your heart that you would go deeper
[1:40:40] it is boas speaking to you hearest thou
[1:40:44] not my
[1:40:45] daughter Hallelujah but so many times we
[1:40:49] pout on God because it don't go my way
[1:40:52] don't go the way we think it ought to
[1:40:55] go that's so good remember God is Not
[1:40:59] mindful to cater to us he said my ways
[1:41:02] are not your ways is that what he said
[1:41:06] my ways are higher than your ways but if
[1:41:07] you allow him remember he's not a
[1:41:09] dictator he Woos us into a place of
[1:41:11] submission with him is that right now
[1:41:14] watch this the Lord
[1:41:16] recompense thy
[1:41:18] Work and a full reward be given thee of
[1:41:21] the Lord God of Israel on under whose
[1:41:23] wings Thou Art come to
[1:41:27] trust notice he sees her working she's
[1:41:30] laboring in the fields she's working it
[1:41:33] out now remember how many knows the
[1:41:35] scripture says work out your own
[1:41:37] salvation with fear and
[1:41:38] trembling Ruth had come into the land
[1:41:42] but that's all the further she had done
[1:41:44] right but thank God she's in the
[1:41:47] land thank God she's in the land thank
[1:41:49] God she's in the right field now the
[1:41:52] prophet said she begins to labor she
[1:41:55] becomes a
[1:41:58] legalist through
[1:42:00] sanctification oh don't don't look at me
[1:42:02] funny every one of us you pass through
[1:42:04] that stage and let me just say it to you
[1:42:06] right now when the Holy Ghost has come
[1:42:08] does not make you a Loosey Goosey
[1:42:10] either Hallelujah are you hearing me you
[1:42:13] still come into a place if then the
[1:42:16] difference is you've got a rest in your
[1:42:17] heart and your desire is to please him
[1:42:20] Above All
[1:42:21] Things yeah that is what has become
[1:42:24] overwhelming in our life let let me just
[1:42:25] try to get somewhere and stop here
[1:42:27] notice then he says unto her watch this
[1:42:29] in verse 13 this is so important then he
[1:42:31] says unto her she says Let Me Find favor
[1:42:36] or Grace in thy sight my lord for thou
[1:42:40] Hast comforted me thou H has spoken
[1:42:44] friendly which means to my inner
[1:42:48] man thou H has spoken friendly unto
[1:42:52] thine handmade though I be not like unto
[1:42:54] one of thine enies how could he speak to
[1:42:56] her inner man he said my
[1:42:59] daughter this was not his daughter Ruth
[1:43:03] of moabitas but that on the
[1:43:06] inside just like you and I there is
[1:43:08] nothing out here flesh and blood will
[1:43:11] not inherit the kingdom of
[1:43:14] God is that right it takes the spirit of
[1:43:17] God and God moving over her life and he
[1:43:20] calls you son he calls you daughter amen
[1:43:24] is that right he's speaking to the inner
[1:43:28] man I'm glad it's a mighty voice aren't
[1:43:31] you I'm glad it's a triumphant voice I'm
[1:43:34] glad it's a voice of authority that
[1:43:36] gives you and I the strength to override
[1:43:39] our own thoughts our own ideas our own
[1:43:41] feelings about oursel and to believe
[1:43:43] what he's saying about us amen
[1:43:47] am that's
[1:43:51] good Romans 6
[1:43:55] 16 know you not watch how Paul says to
[1:44:00] whom ye AB you yield yourself servants
[1:44:02] to obey his servants ye
[1:44:05] are to whom you
[1:44:08] obey whether of sin unto death or of
[1:44:13] obedience unto
[1:44:16] righteousness but God be thaned that you
[1:44:19] were the Servants of sin notice you were
[1:44:23] the Servants of sin Ruth has come in to
[1:44:26] the
[1:44:27] land she's readjusting
[1:44:31] herself adjusting from all of what she's
[1:44:34] known the the gity the pentin of food
[1:44:37] and all that was there and now she's
[1:44:38] having to glean for
[1:44:41] food but when Boaz spoke to her it
[1:44:44] doesn't sound like somebody who's
[1:44:46] disgruntled that's so good it doesn't
[1:44:48] sound like somebody who
[1:44:49] says I got to go out here and labor I
[1:44:53] got to go out here and pick this up oh
[1:44:55] we got to do this oh I got to wear this
[1:44:58] oh that that church up there says you're
[1:45:00] you're missing the
[1:45:01] point you can do everything to the
[1:45:04] letter and still not be
[1:45:08] obedient and let me just tell you it
[1:45:10] ain't what the church is saying the
[1:45:12] church ought to be saying the word but
[1:45:14] it ought to be according to the word let
[1:45:17] me tell you friends I've been around
[1:45:18] long enough where I've heard people say
[1:45:20] well and people want to ask them why do
[1:45:21] you wear long skirts
[1:45:23] why do why do why you why do your women
[1:45:25] not cut their hair well because our
[1:45:27] church teaches it shame on you you ought
[1:45:31] to know that in the
[1:45:32] scripture and if you don't maybe you're
[1:45:34] new look there's some things we can we
[1:45:36] can show you and point it right out in
[1:45:38] the word of God this ain't something
[1:45:40] that the message of the hour made up the
[1:45:42] message of the hour is not a bunch of
[1:45:44] Creeds and Tenants come on friends it's
[1:45:47] the word of God it's Christ being
[1:45:49] revealed it's our protection God ain't
[1:45:52] trying to take something from you he's
[1:45:54] trying to give to you what the enemy had
[1:45:56] wanted to steal from you Satan wants to
[1:45:59] take your virtue Satan wants to rob you
[1:46:02] but God is interested in restoring and
[1:46:05] raising up your
[1:46:08] virtue it's got to be more than because
[1:46:11] of mom and daddy says so it's got to be
[1:46:13] something more than because the church
[1:46:15] says so it's got to be something deeper
[1:46:18] than just because well I read it you
[1:46:19] know and I thank God it's got to be from
[1:46:21] your heart amen right it's got to come
[1:46:24] from the heart if you can take that here
[1:46:26] this morning to recognize what it's all
[1:46:28] about it's about from your heart obeying
[1:46:32] god listen friends I've watched God
[1:46:34] straighten problems up I've watched God
[1:46:36] straighten lives out I've watched God
[1:46:37] straighten homes out right but let me
[1:46:40] tell you something if you don't serve
[1:46:41] God the Bible said if you're healed it
[1:46:43] says you go your way and sin no more
[1:46:45] lest a worse sin come upon you God is
[1:46:48] not a Ouija board God is not somebody we
[1:46:51] run to when just we got a little problem
[1:46:53] and I need a little fix you need more
[1:46:55] than a fix you need a trip to Calvary
[1:46:59] and a trip to Calvary will fix your
[1:47:02] nature it'll fix your problems once and
[1:47:04] for all where it won't be the same old
[1:47:07] weeds cropping up it will be the blood
[1:47:09] that will be transfused into your soul
[1:47:13] that'll lift you from a life of sin and
[1:47:18] unbelief I'm talking about promises
[1:47:20] we're able to
[1:47:21] glean let me try to close here on this
[1:47:24] verse 17 but God bethink ye were the
[1:47:27] Servants of sin but you have
[1:47:30] obeyed from the
[1:47:32] heart that form of Doctrine which was
[1:47:35] delivered to you that's being then made
[1:47:38] free from sin ye became the Servants of
[1:47:45] righteousness over and over God would
[1:47:47] say it in his word he would say in
[1:47:50] Exodus 19 in verse in verse three thus
[1:47:55] shalt thou say to the house of Jacob and
[1:47:57] tell the children of Israel just just
[1:47:58] stay with me ye have seen what I did
[1:48:01] unto the Egyptians how I bear you on
[1:48:03] Eagle wings and brought you unto myself
[1:48:06] if ye will obey my voice indeed and keep
[1:48:09] my Covenant then you shall be a peculiar
[1:48:12] treasure unto me above all people for
[1:48:15] the Earth is mine ye shall be unto me a
[1:48:18] kingdom of priests and a holy nation
[1:48:21] these are the words you should speak to
[1:48:22] them Exodus 23:20 behold I send an angel
[1:48:26] before thee to keep thee in the way to
[1:48:28] bring thee into the place which I've
[1:48:31] prepared beware of him and obey his
[1:48:34] voice provoke him not for he will not
[1:48:36] pardon your transgressions for my name
[1:48:38] is in him but if Thou shalt indeed obey
[1:48:43] his voice and do all that I speak then I
[1:48:47] will be an enemy unto thine enemies and
[1:48:49] an adversary unto thine adversaries the
[1:48:52] Lord Jesus said in John 14:15 if you
[1:48:55] love me now he's speaking to his
[1:48:57] disciples this is prior to Calvary if
[1:48:59] you love me keep my
[1:49:03] Commandments if you Delight in this
[1:49:07] field
[1:49:09] glean glean take of the word take of the
[1:49:14] word absolutely take of the word yes
[1:49:17] this is why when many times remember
[1:49:19] brother Bram over and over ask brother
[1:49:21] Bram when you going to start teaching
[1:49:22] how to receive gifts when you going to
[1:49:24] start teach and what did he say over and
[1:49:25] over how can I teach them algebra when
[1:49:28] they won't even learn their
[1:49:30] ABCs ABCs are things that you can do
[1:49:34] like brother Bram said to stop cutting
[1:49:36] your hair that's good to wearing to
[1:49:38] dressing decently for the men
[1:49:40] straightening up those are ABCs that you
[1:49:42] can do and listen by decisions you show
[1:49:46] your faith in
[1:49:47] God now I I just would say it like this
[1:49:50] in this manner if I would find myself
[1:49:52] here this morning and for some reason
[1:49:54] that there is something in my heart that
[1:49:56] seems to resist and kick against the
[1:49:59] things of
[1:50:00] God God already knows but I would ask
[1:50:04] God Lord take that out of
[1:50:06] me take it out of me yes sir anything
[1:50:09] that resists any little bit of
[1:50:13] resistance take it out of me
[1:50:15] Lord because I don't think anybody in
[1:50:17] here wants to go through the
[1:50:20] motions nobody wants to go through the
[1:50:23] most we didn't come here this morning
[1:50:24] because of
[1:50:25] that and he said I will pray the father
[1:50:28] and he'll give you another comforter
[1:50:29] that he may abide with you forever even
[1:50:32] the spirit of Truth whom the world
[1:50:35] cannot receive now let me just go to
[1:50:39] Hebrews 58 I'm coming down I'm
[1:50:42] coming I want you to see this here I'm
[1:50:45] turning this I'm turning this corner
[1:50:47] here though he were a son yet he learned
[1:50:51] obedience by the things which he
[1:50:54] suffered and being made perfect he
[1:50:57] became the author of Eternal salvation
[1:50:59] unto all that obey
[1:51:03] him 2 Corinthians
[1:51:06] 7:1 I love this having therefore these
[1:51:09] promises dearly beloved let us cleanse
[1:51:13] ourselves from all filthiness of the
[1:51:16] Flesh and spirit perfecting Holiness in
[1:51:20] the fear of God that's beautiful yeah
[1:51:23] that's good so not only where lth Ruth
[1:51:28] and I can remember I can remember that
[1:51:31] of laboring in the
[1:51:32] fields before God finishing and
[1:51:36] completing the work in my life but you
[1:51:37] know it's never stopped the laboring
[1:51:40] it's the laboring itself now is the
[1:51:43] desires and all things I just always
[1:51:45] want to please him it's not because I
[1:51:47] have to do this or because that well
[1:51:49] this is the right thing to do or it's
[1:51:50] not just something in my mind because
[1:51:52] sanctification is setting the mind in
[1:51:54] order for
[1:51:56] Holiness is that right it's necessary
[1:51:59] the things that even when God deals with
[1:52:01] your heart going through Avenues in your
[1:52:03] life it's important hearts that are
[1:52:06] seeking for real real work from God
[1:52:08] where you realize it's not enough for me
[1:52:11] just to be in the right
[1:52:12] field that's not the goal I need to meet
[1:52:16] him amen then God has provided a way and
[1:52:21] a channel to meet him
[1:52:23] Ruth could not go from chapter 1 into
[1:52:26] chapter 3 nor she could she go from
[1:52:28] chapter 1 into chapter 4 there's a way
[1:52:32] is that right the Bible said there's the
[1:52:34] way of Holiness there's a path of
[1:52:37] righteousness there's a path that opens
[1:52:39] up God made a way through the Red Sea
[1:52:42] God makes a way this is why that to a
[1:52:45] real desire in a heart of a Believer
[1:52:48] we're not interested in dodging any
[1:52:49] promise of God we want to obtain every
[1:52:52] promise
[1:52:53] that's
[1:52:53] right yes and I believe this ought to be
[1:52:56] the the part of it in 1 John chapter 3
[1:52:59] pull that up with you Brianna
[1:53:01] please I thinking this is where I was
[1:53:03] thinking of when we sang that song Keep
[1:53:05] Me Sanctified maybe as the musicians
[1:53:07] will make their way
[1:53:10] up because we in our
[1:53:14] journey even along the
[1:53:17] way there's things that God continues to
[1:53:22] work out of our life and throughout our
[1:53:25] journey through places we go through
[1:53:27] everything we need a
[1:53:30] continual sanctifying and there's the
[1:53:33] promise of Ephesians 5 he will wash us
[1:53:37] with the water of the word that's good
[1:53:39] yes sir so even when you take the
[1:53:41] scripture work out your own salvation
[1:53:43] with fear and trembling that can refer
[1:53:44] to sanctification but it also refers to
[1:53:47] on and on as God deals with our heart
[1:53:49] across the word that no matter where
[1:53:50] we're standing it's that time time that
[1:53:52] where we take account of our own soul
[1:53:54] and say Yes Lord yes Lord God deals with
[1:53:58] our life you know sometimes on the
[1:53:59] things with sanctification God
[1:54:01] sanctifying in our life now I'm talking
[1:54:03] about even I I wanted to bring this to
[1:54:05] this place that even for
[1:54:08] lives that you've already experienced
[1:54:10] that of the rest of the Kinsman work sin
[1:54:13] question is
[1:54:15] settled but there's there's a work that
[1:54:18] goes on in our life that where there's
[1:54:20] things that God's called us to take a
[1:54:22] stand upon his
[1:54:24] word God's called us to stand upon that
[1:54:27] word without
[1:54:29] compromising remember with those that
[1:54:31] said to brother brandham and brother
[1:54:33] Bram answers it like this well brother
[1:54:34] Bram I really don't have to go to church
[1:54:35] on Sunday brother Bram said you need to
[1:54:37] be legal on some
[1:54:39] things they said oh I'm not a legalist
[1:54:41] he said you need to be legal on some
[1:54:43] things you need to be legal on that
[1:54:45] right there so there's many things that
[1:54:47] through the word see when the spirit of
[1:54:49] God has come it don't make us loose
[1:54:52] right the more mature the more that
[1:54:54] Christ was moving in your heart the
[1:54:56] greater the desire is to please him it
[1:54:58] goes from you and I making decisions
[1:55:00] about things that's right and wrong to
[1:55:03] where you can looking at look at things
[1:55:05] that could be right and right and you're
[1:55:07] looking at it in a manner to say Lord
[1:55:09] what is the right one that will further
[1:55:12] your will in my
[1:55:13] life are you hearing me where where it's
[1:55:17] no longer that it just keeps on climbing
[1:55:19] and it and this is why that even within
[1:55:21] Paul would say all things are lawful
[1:55:23] unto me but not all things are
[1:55:26] expedient notice the scripture right
[1:55:29] here leaves us to think now we are the
[1:55:32] sons of God and it does not appear what
[1:55:35] we shall be but we know that when he
[1:55:37] shall appear we shall be like him for we
[1:55:41] shall see him as he is and every
[1:55:44] man that ha this hope in him purifieth
[1:55:49] himself even as he is pure that's so
[1:55:51] beautiful yes sir aren't you glad
[1:55:53] there's a source oh
[1:55:55] yes there's a source there's a fountain
[1:55:57] that's open in the House of David not
[1:56:00] only to cleanse from the vness of sin
[1:56:03] but there's a fountain that's open that
[1:56:05] as God deals with our lives and there's
[1:56:07] things sometimes it's a test or trial
[1:56:09] that'll come our way that'll begin to
[1:56:10] show certain things about our character
[1:56:13] and that's a moment of dying right there
[1:56:15] that's a moment of purifying and say yep
[1:56:17] I my expectation is I'm going to see him
[1:56:20] and this whatever this is right here
[1:56:23] it's not worth holding on to that's
[1:56:25] right he's my everything and God has
[1:56:27] permitted a test or trial to bring a
[1:56:31] purifying in our life true I I want to
[1:56:34] be that way don't you I want to be that
[1:56:36] way I want the word to continue to wash
[1:56:39] me to wash me I'm not laboring in a
[1:56:42] sense of of to be found favor yet you
[1:56:45] might be this morning laboring to enter
[1:56:48] into rest and I'm telling you your labor
[1:56:50] is it's not against God but your labor
[1:56:53] is against your own will if you'll just
[1:56:56] let your own will go to him if you'll
[1:57:01] just surrender to him the the real key
[1:57:03] is is Lord let me fall in love with you
[1:57:08] let me fall in love with you I believe
[1:57:10] right here this morning that his grace
[1:57:12] is sufficient to say Lord let a great
[1:57:14] big bundle of love just re refreshing
[1:57:16] just drop down in My Heart Lord maybe
[1:57:19] you found dryness or maybe there's
[1:57:20] parchedness Maybe hearing this from just
[1:57:22] the cares of life not because of sin but
[1:57:25] just the cares of life and you say Lord
[1:57:27] I need some refreshment Lord I need
[1:57:30] refreshment Lord just that refreshment
[1:57:32] you know how it is you can get so weak
[1:57:34] and you get that refreshment and you're
[1:57:35] like I'm ready to go again I'm ready to
[1:57:37] get back in there and begin to glean God
[1:57:39] knows just how to bring that refreshment
[1:57:41] to
[1:57:43] us let's
[1:57:46] pray Heavenly
[1:57:50] Father Lord Jesus
[1:57:53] this is
[1:57:55] truly Lord a burden in our
[1:57:59] hearts thank you Lord for these little
[1:58:02] moments that you've given us to be able
[1:58:04] to look upon your word and where you
[1:58:07] would draw our
[1:58:10] attention on the value of
[1:58:14] obedience sometimes Lord the things that
[1:58:16] you've asked us to
[1:58:17] do sometimes Lord we in our own selves
[1:58:21] we don't altogether
[1:58:23] see the value or the full value of
[1:58:27] it Ruth where she was at in gleaning she
[1:58:31] was gleaning for Life gleaning for
[1:58:37] food it wasn't even until later in this
[1:58:42] chapter that when she comes
[1:58:45] back and Naomi sees what she has in her
[1:58:51] possession
[1:58:52] that
[1:58:53] Naomi would begin to
[1:58:56] worship that God being
[1:59:00] mindful of his
[1:59:03] word God has taken notice of
[1:59:06] us our Kinsman has made himself known
[1:59:12] our
[1:59:13] boas Naomi would follow in the
[1:59:16] concluding parts of this same chapter
[1:59:19] make sure Ruth that he does not find you
[1:59:24] in another
[1:59:27] field his maidens don't let anybody find
[1:59:30] you in a different field stay in this
[1:59:33] field it's the kindness of the lord it's
[1:59:36] the mercy of God he is our near
[1:59:42] Kinsman Ruth's gleanings would go from
[1:59:46] gleaning salvation Grace forgiveness
[1:59:50] Deliverance now now at that
[1:59:56] utterance she would now begin to
[1:59:59] glean the
[2:00:01] promises of
[2:00:03] redemption in that of a
[2:00:05] Kinsman she had gleaned in that first
[2:00:08] part of the field she had gleaned a new
[2:00:11] heart a new
[2:00:13] spirit but your promise is that you
[2:00:16] would give your spirit and cause us to
[2:00:21] keep your
[2:00:23] ways Lord
[2:00:27] Jesus as you've told us in your word no
[2:00:30] man can come to
[2:00:32] you except that we're
[2:00:34] given by the father except to be
[2:00:39] drawn Lord
[2:00:41] Jesus just like a part that would be
[2:00:44] like probably for all of us to
[2:00:46] understand right
[2:00:47] [Music]
[2:00:48] now kind of like a cell phone in the
[2:00:51] sense that if that cell phone doesn't
[2:00:53] have a SIM card in
[2:00:55] it you could try to call it and call it
[2:00:58] and call it it might even be turned on
[2:01:01] but if it don't have anything to receive
[2:01:04] that call and it's not been activated to
[2:01:06] the
[2:01:07] network it will not be able to receive
[2:01:10] anything it will not be able to receive
[2:01:12] the
[2:01:13] call but Lord
[2:01:15] God if there's a drawing there's a
[2:01:19] yearning even Lord Upon A Heart here
[2:01:21] this morning
[2:01:22] morning Lord God whether it's visitor or
[2:01:26] whether Lord It's one Lord God that
[2:01:27] stands right here in the gates
[2:01:31] Lord Lord there's a drawing upon the
[2:01:33] heart then
[2:01:36] father that's you speaking
[2:01:39] friendly to that
[2:01:41] life you're speaking to their
[2:01:44] heart that their heart Lord would be
[2:01:47] turned would be open to
[2:01:49] you frankly Lord you never stop stop
[2:01:52] speaking to our hearts that's what you
[2:01:54] speak to
[2:01:56] Lord you continue to speak to our
[2:02:01] lives Lord I pray this morning if
[2:02:04] there's one that does not know you in
[2:02:07] that
[2:02:08] way maybe Lord God that they've just
[2:02:12] come into the field but they find
[2:02:14] themselves Lord God and maybe they've
[2:02:16] come into the field but they find
[2:02:17] themselves resisting certain things may
[2:02:20] they Lord God realize they need some
[2:02:26] refreshment and Lord I Ask of You
[2:02:29] Lord Change My Heart Lord Turn My Heart
[2:02:33] Lord God soften it
[2:02:37] Lord I don't want to do
[2:02:39] things because it's just simply the
[2:02:42] right things to do I believe there's
[2:02:44] honor in that but Lord I want a heart
[2:02:46] behind
[2:02:48] it I don't just live true to my wife
[2:02:51] because I know it's the right thing to
[2:02:53] do I love
[2:02:56] her I love her and I know she loves
[2:03:01] me I wouldn't want to do anything Lord
[2:03:03] to hurt
[2:03:04] [Music]
[2:03:06] her I don't I don't do what I do because
[2:03:09] I'm afraid she'd leave me I love
[2:03:12] her she's the queen of our
[2:03:14] [Music]
[2:03:17] home Lord God she loves me in that
[2:03:20] way oh Lord we have our
[2:03:24] shortcomings we have to ask one
[2:03:27] another forgive me I shouldn't have said
[2:03:30] that that
[2:03:32] way forgive me I I should have let you
[2:03:35] know about this or I should have
[2:03:36] mentioned this was going to take
[2:03:38] [Music]
[2:03:40] place Lord that's part of staying in
[2:03:42] this field Even in our
[2:03:45] marriage but how much
[2:03:47] more in our walk with you
[2:03:50] Lord
[2:03:55] Lord I pray through this building this
[2:03:58] morning I've not Lord just stood here to
[2:04:00] speak a
[2:04:03] word that would just speak Lord to a
[2:04:07] heart that would
[2:04:08] be in a moment of laboring but to
[2:04:11] realize Lord that song that when I came
[2:04:15] to the platform this morning may it
[2:04:19] be the desire of our heart Lord keep me
[2:04:23] Sanctified Lord God I want to stay Lord
[2:04:26] in that place Paul
[2:04:31] himself he said I'm pressing toward the
[2:04:33] mark of the High Calling of Christ Jesus
[2:04:36] my Lord he admonished us lay aside every
[2:04:39] weight anything that's slowing you down
[2:04:42] lay it aside and every sin that does so
[2:04:44] easily beset
[2:04:47] you Lord God as he would put the hand of
[2:04:49] the believer in the hand of God
[2:04:52] and said dearly
[2:04:54] beloved seeing we have these precious
[2:04:58] promises let us cleanse
[2:05:01] ourselves from all filthiness of the
[2:05:03] spirit and of the
[2:05:04] flesh perfecting
[2:05:07] Holiness in the fear of
[2:05:11] God lord
[2:05:13] Jesus I'm
[2:05:15] thankful I'm
[2:05:17] thankful that not only Lord God my hand
[2:05:20] to be put in your hand but my life to be
[2:05:22] put in to your
[2:05:24] hands you know what I have need of Lord
[2:05:27] you know what each of us have need of
[2:05:29] you know the working in each of Our
[2:05:31] Lives Lord God more than anything if
[2:05:34] Paul could stand there and say lest I be
[2:05:38] a cast away when I have preached to
[2:05:44] others we're not taking these things for
[2:05:46] granted
[2:05:48] Lord but I want to see more of you Lord
[2:05:51] Lord and less of me keep me Sanctified

[2:06:25] things Lord God that we're hearing and
