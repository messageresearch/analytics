[34:14] amen amen
[34:16] god bless y'all good to see you be back
[34:20] in this side of the world in a while
[34:22] trying to figure out what it was and
[34:25] well I got old sin sin so I forgot and
[34:29] so glad sister Kim and brother Samuel
[34:34] got to come out and see me there so we
[34:35] was happy to have him last this last
[34:37] June and we had a wonderful time and
[34:40] there was real blessing to us and we
[34:43] just appreciate you letting them come
[34:44] out our way on the old dry climate you
[34:47] know he needed some of this moisture and
[34:50] then to make it over our way
[34:52] praise the Lord bring you greetings from
[34:54] the Saints down Beaufort South Carolina
[34:56] and also from the Saints out española
[34:59] New Mexico we kind of dual residence
[35:02] right now just Lord keep us on the road
[35:06] most of the time about about of it I
[35:08] guess we're we're try residents today
[35:12] we're resident here so we're we're
[35:15] Ohioans today and and was Canadians
[35:18] yesterday so you just never know where
[35:20] you're liable to find us in this
[35:23] evangelistic journey appreciate the
[35:26] singers and the musicians and as if you
[35:29] have your Bibles they'd like you to go
[35:31] with me over in the Book of Micah and
[35:38] bit of a strange little text but it's
[35:42] been a real blessing to me as I've
[35:45] studied these things and and we get
[35:51] bit of a different situation we get
[35:57] opportunity to speak two times to the
[36:00] same group of people we don't get that
[36:02] very often so usually it's just in today
[36:05] and out tomorrow so we get to hang
[36:08] around and preach again on Sunday so
[36:10] that's at least at this point that's the
[36:12] way it is with the Lord willing and you
[36:15] know we might get the word that we
[36:17] didn't do such a good job tonight and
[36:18] then they have to send us on down the
[36:20] road you know and tell us to go back
[36:23] where we come from so but we'll do our
[36:26] very best to be a blessing to the bride
[36:29] of Jesus Christ
[36:31] here in Micah it's a bit of background
[36:35] on this I I don't know how you all are
[36:39] with with Old Testament especially in
[36:41] the minor prophets they were a little
[36:44] there they are still even a bit
[36:46] intimidating for me to read because
[36:49] there's so much out that I don't
[36:51] understand and so much of it that that
[36:54] brother branham didn't deal with and for
[36:58] my sake if he didn't deal with that I'm
[37:00] pretty much ignorant and so but and so
[37:04] sometimes you know you just have to wait
[37:06] and and so as I was feeling like the
[37:08] Lord led me over here and I was reading
[37:10] and so I had to pray before I read it
[37:12] because many of the things in Micah are
[37:16] historic they have already happened
[37:18] there it's already fulfilled prophecy
[37:20] and then there's other things in there
[37:22] that make absolutely no sense whatsoever
[37:24] to me as just as a 21st century Gentile
[37:31] gospel preacher I don't I don't it
[37:34] doesn't you know I don't have that kind
[37:36] of an education I suppose and so we just
[37:38] have to pray and you just pray Lord
[37:40] along the way as we read these things
[37:43] then if you give us if you're quicken it
[37:46] to us and and so then there's we have a
[37:48] lot of tools and things that are on our
[37:50] disposal different commentaries and
[37:52] Bible you know search engines and all
[37:55] kinds of you know
[37:58] you know commentaries and things that we
[37:59] can that we can use this as study guides
[38:03] but ultimately they were not prophetic
[38:07] they were just you know the origins and
[38:11] things and so we're thankful that God
[38:13] sent us a prophet in the last days so he
[38:15] could come and tie up all the loose ends
[38:17] of all those things that they left
[38:19] undone and so some of the things that
[38:21] they said was was good material it was
[38:23] good it was good it was a it was as it
[38:26] were a good rope amen and but the
[38:28] Prophet had to tie up the loose parts
[38:30] and that's what we're so thankful for
[38:31] and so as I come into the Book of Micah
[38:35] needless to say there was some of those
[38:38] things that I was able to understand and
[38:40] read commentaries and kind of get some
[38:42] some bearing on it but ultimately
[38:46] there's still a lot of it that it's got
[38:47] big holes as far as my understanding but
[38:50] I came to this one verse of scripture
[38:51] and it was like it just jumped off the
[38:54] page and I liked it when it happens like
[38:56] that and I didn't altogether know
[38:58] exactly what I was reading but I knew
[39:01] that the Lord was in it and so we was
[39:03] able to just pray and and and I read a
[39:08] couple of things and then I began to see
[39:10] something there and it's just really
[39:12] been enlightening and helpful to me so
[39:16] hopefully it'll be the same for you I
[39:19] want to begin reading at verse 12 of
[39:21] chapter 2 Micah chapter 2 and we begin
[39:26] reading at verse 12 Micah here the the
[39:32] prophet we realized that he was a poor
[39:33] man like amos but he was a contemporary
[39:36] with isaiah and so isaiah prophesied
[39:39] with the among the very affluent and the
[39:43] wealth and dignitaries and kings of that
[39:45] time he was isaiah was a friend of the
[39:47] king uzziah and at the same time that he
[39:49] was prophesying or at least to a
[39:52] different group of people different
[39:53] class of people will you had this man
[39:55] Micah and so Micah comes here in verse
[39:59] 12 and he says I will surely assemble Oh
[40:02] Jacob all of thee I will surely gather
[40:05] the remnant of is
[40:08] I will put them together as the sheep of
[40:11] Borgia as the flock in the midst of
[40:14] their fold they shall make great noise
[40:17] by reason of the multitude of men the
[40:22] breaker is come up before them they have
[40:25] broken up and have passed through the
[40:27] gate and are gone out by it and their
[40:30] king shall pass before them and the Lord
[40:34] on the head of them may the Lord bless
[40:38] the reading of the word this evening as
[40:39] you have your seats would like to take
[40:46] my text out of the 13th verse there it
[40:50] says the breaker is come up and I'd like
[40:54] to title the message this evening the
[40:56] breaker my studies I found that this one
[41:01] of those commentators spiros Oh deities
[41:04] he's a Greek theologian and he was a it
[41:07] was a Bible scholar and it was actually
[41:11] the editor of my Study Bible and he
[41:14] makes a statement there that the breaker
[41:16] which really means the one who breaks
[41:20] open is a reference to Israel's Messiah
[41:25] and so then as we we we now have put a
[41:29] title here the breaker that this word
[41:33] breaker actually should be capitalized
[41:36] in your Bible there and senator the
[41:39] lowercase but it should be capitalized
[41:42] you can go in other places in the Bible
[41:44] where it speaks of the branch and they
[41:46] capitalized that and and different
[41:48] places like that throughout the the rod
[41:50] of Jesse and they capitalized that and
[41:52] and different places through the Bible
[41:54] then it speaks of them and gives title
[41:57] to the Messiah and they would capitalize
[41:59] it here they fail to do so but I believe
[42:03] that we have that because if it's a if
[42:07] it's a person place or a thing according
[42:09] to the last time I was in English class
[42:12] which is well it wasn't really quite
[42:14] your business and
[42:17] was a long time ago we knew that a
[42:19] person place or a thing but if it was a
[42:22] proper noun it had to be if it dealt
[42:24] with the name of a person or a place
[42:26] then it had to be capitalized so we can
[42:29] say here that this the breaker if it was
[42:32] referencing the Messiah then we would
[42:35] surely want to capitalize it he meant
[42:37] and so here this breaker has come up and
[42:41] so as we look at this fellow we find
[42:45] that he is one who breaks open one who
[42:50] from the New International Version the
[42:53] Bible says the one who breaks open the
[42:56] way will go before them and they will
[43:00] break through the gate and go out they
[43:02] will amen so we have this one that would
[43:05] lead the way that would break open or
[43:08] break through and there would be some
[43:10] that would go through with him the king
[43:13] which the king and the breaker are
[43:15] synonymous to each other that their king
[43:18] would pass through before him the Lord
[43:20] at their head so this this brick her
[43:23] this one that was going forth or the one
[43:26] that would burst out and it actually
[43:28] speaks of the one who would break forth
[43:31] from the womb and so we see that that
[43:34] this is a very type of the Lord Jesus
[43:37] that that he broke through from the
[43:40] wound amen
[43:41] that he was that he was one prophesied
[43:45] that a virgin would conceive and she
[43:49] would bear a son and this son would
[43:51] break forth and we realized that this
[43:54] word is um the the Hebrew word is the
[44:00] word is I think I haven't written here
[44:02] yes it's Forres @ph Oh are easy which is
[44:07] if you'll have your Bible scholars
[44:10] you'll understand that that's close to
[44:11] feriss ferriss as though as the twin
[44:14] brother that was born of Tamar I believe
[44:18] it was and that he put his hand forth
[44:21] before his brother and they tied a
[44:23] scarlet thread around it so he broke
[44:25] forth they met and so they named him
[44:28] Farrah's and so this word the breaker
[44:31] here is Forres or the one who breaks
[44:34] forth from the womb the one who would
[44:37] break through or break down that would
[44:40] make a breach or to break into to break
[44:43] open hallelujah - to break up and to
[44:46] break into pieces to break out violently
[44:50] upon as though like a plague in the days
[44:53] of David we need when he called for the
[44:55] the mercies of God rather than the wrath
[44:58] of man and so that he but uh but of the
[45:02] the plague broke out and on the people
[45:05] it was violent it was a violent breaking
[45:08] out upon the people and then finally it
[45:10] means to break over as in the limits and
[45:14] so when when the cup would get to the
[45:16] very top and as it would get to that you
[45:19] know however if your watch there the
[45:21] water when it gets to the milk came and
[45:23] when it gets to the top of the glass it
[45:24] kind of looks like it goes up a little
[45:26] bit further than the top now they call
[45:29] that that gripping around the the seal
[45:31] of them other of the the mouth of the
[45:35] jar the the glass there and you kind of
[45:38] mounds up a little it kind of and your
[45:39] way home I put too much milk in there
[45:41] and and so that's when you get down and
[45:43] sort of put off there right quick before
[45:45] it runs all over the place well that
[45:48] little mounding up there is what they
[45:49] call it it's capillary action is the
[45:51] actual scientific term of it but it's
[45:54] it's gripping it's it's it's it's
[45:56] attracted to it but then finally gravity
[45:58] takes over and it breaks forth and it
[46:00] goes all over the counter and all over
[46:02] moms forward there you go and so so it's
[46:06] a breaking over or when you go past the
[46:09] limit ie speed limits things like that
[46:12] sound barriers speedling those barriers
[46:16] that there that are there so we we see
[46:18] that this is this breaker that we're
[46:20] speaking of we find that the scripture
[46:23] actually speaks of one that would
[46:27] actually come before him he said I'll
[46:31] send you the messenger before me and it
[46:35] speaks of John the Baptist the
[46:37] forerunner of Christ
[46:39] and he was under the spirit of Elijah
[46:42] and he was to come he was to break or to
[46:45] prepare once and they would actually go
[46:48] where there was no trail there was no
[46:50] road there was no passage there before
[46:53] and these men would survey the land and
[46:56] try to make the most direct route that
[46:59] they could find and so they would survey
[47:01] the land to build a railroad or whatever
[47:04] it might be and they were the they were
[47:05] the Trailblazers these were the ones
[47:07] that that actually surveyed the way
[47:09] across from the east coast to the west
[47:11] coast what we find that that's the the
[47:15] arm the purpose of John the Baptist was
[47:18] to clear the way and it speaks of the
[47:22] one that would make way for the for the
[47:27] Lord and he would and it speaks of an of
[47:30] an oriental custom of how that they
[47:33] would send men before to kick the rocks
[47:36] and the logs and everything out when the
[47:38] king was riding on his coach they would
[47:41] fill in the holes and they would they
[47:43] would they would you know cut down the
[47:44] humps and whatever so his chariot would
[47:46] ride smoothly and these were the ones
[47:48] that were the breakers that went before
[47:50] Oh hallelujah if you help me a little
[47:53] bit we'll breach here and so John the
[47:59] Baptist was one that cleared the way for
[48:02] Christ by his doctrine and by his
[48:05] baptism
[48:09] Malachi 3 from the New Living
[48:12] Translation I like this he says look I
[48:15] am the mess I am sending my messenger
[48:18] and he will prepare the way before me
[48:20] then the Lord you are seeking will
[48:25] suddenly come to his temple the
[48:28] messenger of the Covenant whom you
[48:30] looked for so eagerly is surely coming
[48:33] says the Lord of heavens armies hey man
[48:37] Oh hallelujah it was the Lord of hosts
[48:40] hey man his armies were coming with him
[48:42] and he was going to go on before them
[48:44] the Bible says amen and their King and
[48:46] their Lord would be at their head we
[48:50] find that up in the North Country in the
[48:53] Arctic Circle
[48:54] I've been up along the Bering Straits
[48:56] and up along in there and those those
[48:59] typically salt water doesn't freeze but
[49:03] because the land it's so cold up in the
[49:06] in the Arctic Circle and then also in
[49:09] the Antarctic as well that this water
[49:11] actually separates and it freezes and it
[49:15] becomes very thick but yet they have to
[49:17] have passage into certain villages and
[49:20] so forth and and so what they have to
[49:22] have is they have to have a
[49:23] specially-designed
[49:25] ship amen and this ship is called an
[49:28] icebreaker
[49:30] it has a special hull that is a
[49:33] reinforce they meant it has a special
[49:35] engine amen this dynamo that's inside of
[49:39] it well it's got an it's got a super
[49:41] power amen it's not really designed for
[49:44] anything other than to make away amen
[49:47] hey so that the ship coming behind it
[49:50] that is bearing the precious cargo would
[49:53] it be able to make a way into the
[49:55] village or into the place Oh mine so God
[49:58] sent and Elijah prophet in the days of
[50:01] the Lord to make way for the Lord
[50:05] to prepare the way before him why
[50:07] because there was coming a ship after
[50:09] him hey man who was bearing precious
[50:12] cargo that way before him hallelujah oh
[50:20] I'm so glad for this icebreaker amen he
[50:23] come in the spirit of Elijah amen to
[50:27] make way for the Christ amen we find
[50:30] that Christ Himself is also best
[50:33] represented as this breaker because he
[50:36] broke through from the world hey man he
[50:39] broke through from the world to identify
[50:41] himself as the virgin born son of God
[50:44] but we find that he also he began to
[50:47] break through
[50:48] the Judeo systems in the law had he been
[50:51] to break through through insanity and
[50:57] sickness and diseases all he broke
[51:01] through Haven in through his personal
[51:03] ministry we find that he was then he was
[51:06] betrayed of his familiar friend and he
[51:09] was crucified but the Bible says Amen
[51:12] Jesus of himself since highly my life
[51:15] tailed and I will pick it back up again
[51:18] hey then hold on he said you put me in
[51:22] the term but in three days how rise
[51:25] again hey hey man oh why because he was
[51:28] he was lord over heaven and earth he
[51:31] wasn't Lord of the living amen and he
[51:34] was Lord of the day why nothing could
[51:37] hold him and we find on Easter morning
[51:39] oh my he broke out at the rising of the
[51:43] Sun this tomb couldn't hold him death
[51:46] couldn't hold
[51:48] take over man
[51:55] we find that this this action of his
[52:04] breaking forth from the tomb that he
[52:09] broke through and vanquished all enemies
[52:15] Bible says that he conquered death he
[52:21] conquered sin he conquered sickness he
[52:25] conquered hell and he conquered the
[52:28] grave amen
[52:31] the Bible says that he led captivity
[52:33] captive and gave gifts unto men hey man
[52:36] and he that descent he that I sent at
[52:39] first descended he went down and broke
[52:41] through amen the doors of hell huh hey
[52:44] man he went down there he went there for
[52:46] a reason and that was to deposit all of
[52:50] my mistakes all of my sins all of my
[52:53] parts and failures he took them down
[52:56] there and put on all the devil's
[52:58] doorstep hey man and then he came out
[53:01] and he broke through paradise and he led
[53:04] captivity captive amen oh my he went all
[53:09] the way up into Heaven's heaven and he
[53:11] broke into heaven hallelujah
[53:13] oh my he went up there and said lift up
[53:16] your gates
[53:17] the everlasting gates and let the King
[53:20] of glory come in hey Danny come leading
[53:23] the way into heaven's gates amen we find
[53:31] that he he broke through all the troops
[53:37] of hell
[53:37] oh that brother man said they had a
[53:41] conference down in hell oh I'm so glad
[53:45] we had a prophet in our day that had the
[53:48] ability to look into hell and listen in
[53:51] how the devil's conversation had hey man
[53:55] in the devil said he spoke to death he
[53:58] said we've got to stop him we've got
[54:00] that we've got to end this now
[54:02] you've got to end his ministry right now
[54:04] because if you don't were finished amen
[54:08] oh my he knew that he had to he had to
[54:11] he had to stop this virgin born son of
[54:14] God but we find that brother branham
[54:17] tells us that there was a man in the sky
[54:19] believe it was in Switzerland by the
[54:21] name of Arnold Van Winkle Reid and
[54:24] Arnold knew that they couldn't defend
[54:26] themselves against the German army but
[54:29] he's had with this day I give my life
[54:31] for my own countrymen and he ran into
[54:34] the thickest part of the spears and he
[54:36] embraced the spears and said make way
[54:39] for liberty hallelujah the man said we
[54:42] had one a man named the Lord Jesus
[54:45] Christ who ran into the thickest spears
[54:47] of death and hell and he embraced them
[54:50] and said make way her
[54:53] for Adams race hallelujah he said now
[54:58] come on boys let's try to drive him to
[55:01] the fighting walls Haven because Christ
[55:04] has gone before us and has broke through
[55:06] amen to heavens Joy's and endless days
[55:13] he broke through all difficulties Amen
[55:18] that lay in the way of the salvation of
[55:21] his people there was so much in the way
[55:27] but he kicked all the roadblocks out he
[55:31] rolled all the big stones out all so
[55:34] that you and I we would have all let me
[55:37] tell you friends one day the Lord Jesus
[55:39] was hanging there above the above the
[55:43] earth and beneath the heaven heaven
[55:47] couldn't receive him because he bore the
[55:49] sins of the world
[55:50] heaven didn't want are held in warning
[55:53] Amen because hey man he was a virgin
[55:56] born son of God also there he hung
[55:59] between heaven and earth while there he
[56:02] was beaten beyond human recognition he
[56:04] had bled out oh he was dehydrated he was
[56:08] dying of hypothermia oh he was he was he
[56:11] was he would had blood loss sleep
[56:14] deprivation all all these things were
[56:17] upon him blunt-force trauma all the
[56:20] medical things that were upon him he was
[56:22] hanging there but right at the right at
[56:25] the precipice of life and death and as
[56:29] he's hanging there between malefactors
[56:32] there is one on his right amen and the
[56:34] one on his right said he was he said he
[56:37] started praying he said Lord when you
[56:42] come into your kingdom remember me no
[56:46] not you had thought that the Lord Jesus
[56:48] at the weakest moment of his earthly
[56:51] ministry at the very weakest at the very
[56:54] frailest
[56:56] at the very point of death he would have
[56:59] thought that he said just can't you let
[57:01] me die in peace can't you just let me
[57:04] just finish my course is it good is it
[57:07] too much to ask
[57:08] just to let me alone oh but let me tell
[57:11] you huh
[57:12] hey buddy you looked over to that pay
[57:14] for the ride
[57:15] hey man oh Jesus
[57:20] and and he brought that man who was at
[57:24] the Greek of Hell at the brink of death
[57:28] and any in his weakest moment that his
[57:33] frailest moment is a mortal on the earth
[57:37] I've been hanging there Oh amen
[57:40] he told that young man he says this day
[57:44] you'll be with me in paradise think
[57:51] about it kid if he do that then at his
[57:55] weakest moment what can he do for you
[57:59] even here to narrate as a mighty
[58:02] Conqueror
[58:03] when he conquered 70 know as the brake
[58:06] car ended up the one who is broken sleep
[58:09] oh that's right Jesus that's what I'm
[58:13] talking about
[58:14] yeah Alleluia brother Brendan makes a
[58:24] statement
[58:24] oh he said he bore his children upon his
[58:33] shoulders because it was the strongest
[58:37] part of his body
[58:39] they bore the children on his shoulders
[58:43] but with his finger the Lord I'm talking
[58:53] about the one a man who has your soul in
[58:56] his care the one has had a man that no
[58:59] man can you take you away from me aim at
[59:02] all that the father is giving me they
[59:04] will come to me and I won't lose a
[59:07] one-up oh but he gets rid of Devils with
[59:14] his finger but he bears you on his
[59:16] shoulders or into God a man he broke
[59:23] down the middle wall of partition but
[59:26] the ceremonial law between Jew and
[59:29] Gentile they rent the veil all about how
[59:34] to run away brother I was just riding
[59:36] the tube and it wasn't even in this
[59:41] pattern of songs that he sang this
[59:42] evening I wrote down the tomb he goes
[59:44] the term now is empty
[59:48] huh oh you think god I need control
[59:56] either way just win in the Easter
[59:58] morning huh now what right what about
[1:00:03] that on I just couldn't leave it I said
[1:00:06] there it is he broke off the yoke of sin
[1:00:15] and Satan under the hall set them at
[1:00:21] liberty and that was his resurrection he
[1:00:24] broke us under the cords of death
[1:00:30] the watchman brother mem says he says
[1:00:34] then then when he died for our sins come
[1:00:37] through the way of paradise and taken
[1:00:40] the waiting souls and broke through
[1:00:41] every spiritual power that the devil had
[1:00:45] bound the earth with and made a streak
[1:00:50] so that the sunlight of God's eternal
[1:00:52] grace could shine upon those who were
[1:00:55] willing to receive it
[1:00:56] oh there was an age of darkness it was
[1:01:00] called the seventh age it was called
[1:01:02] Laodicea amen it was it was called the
[1:01:05] days of Sodom and Gomorrah it was called
[1:01:08] the days of Noah amen it was the day
[1:01:10] that we live in amen and the Lord Jesus
[1:01:13] Christ made a streak amen so that light
[1:01:16] could shine into our age and so that
[1:01:20] those Amen that they could receive
[1:01:22] eternal grace amen and so that that
[1:01:25] light would shine upon those who are
[1:01:26] willing to receive it so glad for that
[1:01:30] this evening we find that he was the
[1:01:35] breaker according to the scripture of
[1:01:38] stony hearts oh we're talking about our
[1:01:43] hearts our lives the Bible says that he
[1:01:47] would take away amen at a heart of stone
[1:01:50] and give you a heart of flesh
[1:01:52] amen brother that said the reason that
[1:01:54] he done that is so that you can even get
[1:01:56] along with yourself huh think about that
[1:01:59] so ornery you can't even
[1:02:01] along with yourself but he said he'll
[1:02:05] break the stony heart hallelujah he
[1:02:08] would come and give you a heart of flesh
[1:02:09] he said then I will give you my spirit
[1:02:12] hallelujah oh my
[1:02:15] and so here it is to break these stony
[1:02:17] hearts sometimes we get so hard in our
[1:02:21] spirits we become spiritually calcified
[1:02:24] amen in calais so to the point that we
[1:02:28] can't even be moved by the moving of the
[1:02:30] holy gold hold that I say God come and
[1:02:33] break this old stony heart come and make
[1:02:36] me a heart of flesh maybe somebody that
[1:02:38] can be sensitive to the moving of the
[1:02:40] spirit break away all this crust oh let
[1:02:43] me be that eagle amen and find a stone
[1:02:46] of Revelation and begin to beat my head
[1:02:49] a minute until I get all the world and
[1:02:52] everything broken off so I can set my
[1:02:55] wings amen to the wings of the wind the
[1:03:03] scripture says to break up the fallow
[1:03:06] ground well if we're not farmers then
[1:03:09] that probably doesn't mean a whole lot
[1:03:10] to you but what fallow ground is is that
[1:03:15] you come in in the wintertime and you
[1:03:17] set your Ripper's real deep and you go
[1:03:20] through and you break up the deep the
[1:03:22] ground real deep and you leave it broke
[1:03:26] up so that the frost can get down
[1:03:29] because the frost will get down below
[1:03:31] what you broke break up in this country
[1:03:33] up to three feet deep and when it does
[1:03:36] that ice will get down into that ground
[1:03:38] and when it thaws it an ice expands the
[1:03:42] dirt and it breaks it even deeper so you
[1:03:46] can actually a magnified benefit that
[1:03:50] once you've broken the ground then the
[1:03:52] frost will actually give you an
[1:03:54] additional so many feet of broken earth
[1:03:56] and the reason they do that is so that
[1:03:59] the so that it will retain water so it
[1:04:02] will fluff the earth up so you can have
[1:04:04] a good ground to plant the seat but we
[1:04:08] find that as I have they broken that all
[1:04:10] up and they come back through
[1:04:12] maybe the next year they don't plant but
[1:04:14] what they'll do is they'll go over that
[1:04:16] that of that busted soil act that and
[1:04:20] they'll run what they call a hero and a
[1:04:23] heroine all the dirt clods and fill in
[1:04:25] all the gaps and everything and make a
[1:04:27] nice level field out there but but now
[1:04:30] that ground is what they call fallow in
[1:04:34] other words it's ground that's been
[1:04:36] plowed and left gold for a year but it's
[1:04:40] unimproved n't bow if your spiritual
[1:04:44] this evening amen so what we find that
[1:04:47] many times is that as that we've been
[1:04:49] plowed we've set in church we had come
[1:04:51] under the effect of trials and
[1:04:53] tribulation and it's an added benefit
[1:04:56] the Bible says to that count it all joy
[1:05:00] amen so it's joy to go through trials
[1:05:03] even though we don't enjoy it but yet it
[1:05:05] has it's it's its effect on us but then
[1:05:09] you know so then after a little while we
[1:05:11] sit in church and it gets all leveled
[1:05:13] off in there and it's all been leveled
[1:05:16] down and Herald out and oh we're just
[1:05:18] we're just a beautiful field of church
[1:05:20] members oh my oh we got our church order
[1:05:24] in man down pat we're just oh we're just
[1:05:27] a beautiful field but it's unimpressive
[1:05:31] it's never had a crop sown in it and so
[1:05:34] the Bible then comes back and says hey
[1:05:37] you've got to go break up the fallow
[1:05:39] ground now you've got to go through and
[1:05:41] you've got to put it in wind rows you
[1:05:42] got to come through there and plant the
[1:05:44] seed in it
[1:05:45] you've got to drill the seed into the
[1:05:47] soil and and and rake this he did
[1:05:49] otherwise it's just a dirt field brother
[1:05:53] Graham said eventually he said it'll
[1:05:55] just be a patch of weeds he said there
[1:05:59] you go a bunch of this is his words not
[1:06:01] mine a bunch a world record weeds I have
[1:06:07] never seen a weed competition at the
[1:06:09] fair
[1:06:11] if they had some I believe I could win
[1:06:14] that competition
[1:06:16] because out where I live in New Mexico
[1:06:18] we grow some big old tumbleweeds bigger
[1:06:20] this desk here
[1:06:21] oh they're a beautiful thing absolutely
[1:06:24] worthless cows won't even eat all they
[1:06:28] do is roll around not my fences dinner
[1:06:29] but all there's a week oh my and that's
[1:06:33] where a lot of a lot of us get to we're
[1:06:36] just world record weeds hold that we
[1:06:38] need to tear up the fallow ground
[1:06:40] we need that have the breaker the
[1:06:42] country and showing us seeds of
[1:06:44] righteousness seeds of joy and peace
[1:06:48] maybe that we could bring forth fruit in
[1:06:50] our season hallelujah he is a chain
[1:06:57] breaker hallelujah chains of bondage
[1:07:02] bondage of spiritual unbelief the Bible
[1:07:06] says that they would have a form of
[1:07:08] godliness but denying the power thereof
[1:07:11] those chains need to be broken off of
[1:07:14] God's people there they have a form of
[1:07:17] godliness they come to church set on the
[1:07:19] Pew pay their tithe check the preachers
[1:07:21] hand that's all well and good we
[1:07:23] appreciate that but it's never going to
[1:07:25] get you into heaven or but we need a
[1:07:28] chain breaker to come to break the
[1:07:31] chains of spiritual unbelief we need a
[1:07:34] chain breaker to come and break the
[1:07:36] chains of our own thoughts
[1:07:38] the Bible says lean not to your own
[1:07:42] understanding so many times we think we
[1:07:45] just gotta outsmart the the preacher we
[1:07:48] gotta outsmart the pastor we gotta
[1:07:50] outsmart the prophet so many times
[1:07:54] people wonder well brother baron admit
[1:07:56] this and brother in a minute then well I
[1:07:58] just ain't got that smart yet I'm sorry
[1:08:03] I just want to say what he said and say
[1:08:06] it the way he said it
[1:08:07] and we'll put words in his mouth break
[1:08:12] the chains of tradition jesus said you
[1:08:18] by your traditions make the Word of God
[1:08:21] of none effect people become so bound in
[1:08:24] tradition they've become so traditional
[1:08:29] in their ways brother man said we need
[1:08:31] to get out of church order long enough
[1:08:33] to get somebody saved oh man I think
[1:08:37] there ought to be you know there ought
[1:08:38] to be shouting there ought to be running
[1:08:40] the house and speaking in tongues and
[1:08:42] glorifying God in the Church of the
[1:08:44] Living God in this hour that we live in
[1:08:47] but we get so bound down in our
[1:08:49] tradition then you've got the other side
[1:08:51] of it that says you didn't even have a
[1:08:53] church service unless somebody speaks in
[1:08:54] tongues and then all they do is just
[1:08:56] speak in tongues they got identified but
[1:09:03] nobody else did
[1:09:04] barbarians Bible says so then we come
[1:09:11] break the chains of death spiritual
[1:09:16] death the Bible says he that liveth in
[1:09:18] pleasure is dead wow she liveth even
[1:09:23] that's not just the sisters that's
[1:09:25] that's the church amen all they're so
[1:09:29] wound up in there and they're in their
[1:09:31] entertainments and their sports and all
[1:09:34] their fashions and all these other kind
[1:09:37] of things they're so caught up in those
[1:09:38] things to where the very fact that they
[1:09:40] can't even let them that their their
[1:09:44] hearts become calloused and condemn them
[1:09:47] and so that they can't even have a move
[1:09:49] of God in their hearts oh but my Bible
[1:09:53] says that even the dead heard the Sun of
[1:09:55] golf
[1:09:57] we may break the chains of death natural
[1:10:04] death he meant so many times we've heard
[1:10:07] him oh well you're gonna die you've got
[1:10:09] this disease or you got that disease I
[1:10:11] don't have to accept that I'm gonna
[1:10:14] break the chains of death you know but I
[1:10:17] said we don't fear cancer we don't fear
[1:10:20] heart and diabetes and all these other
[1:10:22] kind of thing we don't fear those things
[1:10:24] though we hey we might die that tomorrow
[1:10:27] I don't know but I'm not afraid of it
[1:10:29] amen the chains of death and hell have
[1:10:32] been broken when he said it's finished
[1:10:35] when he said it's finished it was
[1:10:37] finished he breaks he's the breaker
[1:10:43] tonight and he breaks cycles family
[1:10:48] cycles there's so many times that
[1:10:52] families have these inherent behaviors
[1:10:57] that will handed down brother never said
[1:10:59] you've got that anger from your own core
[1:11:01] you got that you've got that spirit like
[1:11:04] that of a critical he said some of you
[1:11:07] talked about that boy that he that his
[1:11:09] mother was a German and his father was
[1:11:12] an Irishman poor fella you know and so
[1:11:18] he had one attribute that was from his
[1:11:22] mother that he that he was just uh I
[1:11:25] believe he was some about reading
[1:11:28] reserved and that he there was something
[1:11:31] bad that he that he wasn't ever he
[1:11:33] something some about that he that he
[1:11:34] went back on the on his engagement with
[1:11:36] a girl that's what brought the whole
[1:11:37] thing up and then the other side of it
[1:11:40] was his father's side I believe was that
[1:11:42] he was he was an Irishman start getting
[1:11:43] real angry and he said but our son is it
[1:11:48] was raised in church but then said that
[1:11:51] doesn't have anything to do with it he
[1:11:54] said he's got to be born again
[1:11:57] that's the only thing that will break
[1:11:59] those family cycles country cycles real
[1:12:05] instead of the United States was a haha
[1:12:07] and Germany was all in order and and and
[1:12:10] and in other countries Heather all the
[1:12:14] way talk about the Canadians being a

[1:12:59] the Bible says in Book of Daniel that
[1:13:02] there was a mountain that rose up out of
[1:13:04] the earth and it speaks of an image and
[1:13:08] that image for them tells us there was
[1:13:11] those Gentile ages was in that image had
[1:13:14] the head of gold that babylonian kings
[1:13:16] and then went down through the the the
[1:13:18] medo-persians and then it come down to
[1:13:20] the greeks and then down into the romans
[1:13:22] and then it was mixed with iron and clay
[1:13:24] down at the feet he said that was both
[1:13:26] Protestantism and Roman ISM there was
[1:13:29] this image there he said but then this
[1:13:30] mountain rose up and there was a there
[1:13:33] was a stone that was cut out without
[1:13:36] hands he said and that stone came
[1:13:39] rolling down the mountain and struck the
[1:13:42] image in the feet oh let me tell you

[1:14:38] unto men this is from Hebrews there was
[1:14:41] an atmosphere hung over the earth of
[1:14:43] darkness of gloom and death and weary
[1:14:46] and the prayers couldn't come up because
[1:14:49] the atonement wasn't made but he broke

[1:16:16] condemnation is self condemnation my
[1:16:20] Bible says who condemned it was a
[1:16:23] question does God know he's the one that
[1:16:27] justifies you he's the one that takes
[1:16:29] away your sin that forgives you freely

[1:16:52] and sure to forgive you of your sin if
[1:16:55] you can pass your sin otherwise the
[1:17:01] blood of Jesus Christ was without was
[1:17:05] that without value you cheapen your
[1:17:07] Redeemer you imagine to cheapen the
[1:17:11] blood of Christ something so worthless
[1:17:14] that it couldn't forgive you well let me
[1:17:17] tell you it's priceless
[1:17:20] amen is priceless this given for
[1:17:23] worthlessness I meant because I was
[1:17:26] without worth but the brother Brad said
[1:17:28] that he looked upon me and the the
[1:17:32] purchase of the blood became more
[1:17:34] valuable than the blood itself
[1:17:41] he broke barriers oh my brother BAM
[1:17:47] talks about the the the the this the
[1:17:50] sound barrier
[1:17:55] from perseverant but that says and maybe
[1:17:58] there will be someone with faith enough
[1:18:00] to break through the barrier yonder that
[1:18:03] sound barrier that sin barrier that
[1:18:08] unbelieving barrier break through that
[1:18:10] to where all things are possible
[1:18:13] amen oh my I might have told you this
[1:18:16] story but you've probably got some age
[1:18:18] on you by now and you forgot and or some
[1:18:21] of you was little babies back then and
[1:18:24] you so you don't remember either so if
[1:18:27] you remember while you was in that sweet
[1:18:29] spot and you just have to bear with the
[1:18:31] rest of us but what I took my family to
[1:18:36] Six Flags Over Texas a big amusement
[1:18:39] park and because my family for whatever
[1:18:43] reason had to come from their mother's
[1:18:46] side they loved to ride them roller
[1:18:50] coasters and I know it come from their
[1:18:54] side because I just took here a few
[1:18:56] years back my wife and my mother-in-law
[1:18:59] the Universal Studios and they rode
[1:19:03] roller coasters all day long I'm talking
[1:19:06] about an old gray-haired grandma
[1:19:14] needless to say I didn't stay and I just
[1:19:20] got my fishing boat and I went to the
[1:19:22] lake and sit out there was nice and calm
[1:19:24] hey man but anyways so I took them to
[1:19:29] this here huesemann park and there was a
[1:19:32] they just kept telling me daddy was
[1:19:34] right on this you know this Texas giant
[1:19:36] over here and let's ride the spider-man
[1:19:38] and let's ride on this make me sick I
[1:19:43] don't do well and so far I've seen this
[1:19:47] one said it was a it was a flight
[1:19:52] simulator where you could break the
[1:19:55] sound barrier
[1:19:56] well I've seen that I said man I'll go
[1:19:59] on that one that's it you know I you
[1:20:01] know it's just a simulator we can handle
[1:20:03] that
[1:20:04] and there was an O dad that's it boring
[1:20:07] we don't want to go in there and write
[1:20:08] that I said well have you gonna ride
[1:20:10] with me you gonna ride this one and so
[1:20:13] anyways we went over there well it was a
[1:20:15] line to get in the place and there was
[1:20:17] already a viewing going on and so we had
[1:20:19] to stand out on this side while you sat
[1:20:20] on this side waiting there's a little
[1:20:22] monitor up there and there's this man
[1:20:24] comes out there in a red jumpsuit he's a
[1:20:26] some sort of a pilot or whatever and and
[1:20:29] so he comes out there and he says he
[1:20:31] starts telling about the history of
[1:20:32] flight well I don't think he's reading a
[1:20:34] message or something you know he's
[1:20:37] talking about how do they get up to a
[1:20:39] certain speed and the plane was going to
[1:20:41] fall apart I don't say that's what the
[1:20:43] Prophet said yeah I have a limited
[1:20:48] education and so he's talking about all
[1:20:51] this things he said he said those early
[1:20:54] pilots and men of the early days of
[1:20:57] aeronautics that they would get up to
[1:20:59] this the speed of about 750 miles an
[1:21:02] hour and it was like the plane was going
[1:21:05] to come apart and they would get afraid
[1:21:07] and they would pull off the throttle
[1:21:08] because they believed this is what they
[1:21:10] said this is their their language was
[1:21:13] that they believed that there was a
[1:21:15] demon in the sky and there was afraid of
[1:21:18] that demon well I'm starting to get
[1:21:21] happy okay he's speaking my language
[1:21:25] demons and sound barriers and you know
[1:21:28] all these kind of things and someone say
[1:21:30] home my brother and so anyways he's uh
[1:21:38] so he's telling this story and about
[1:21:42] this this certain pilot I forget his
[1:21:44] name I should remember it I've studied
[1:21:47] it many times but I can't remember his
[1:21:48] name but anyways he got this certain
[1:21:50] plane and he got up there and out over
[1:21:51] this I think was a Salt Flats out there
[1:21:54] and in California and he flew that plane
[1:21:56] and he broke the sound barrier oh there
[1:21:59] was a sonic boom and everything and he
[1:22:01] went out beyond it and he tells a story
[1:22:02] about it as limited this power and all
[1:22:04] this man brother
[1:22:06] you know we got in church all of a
[1:22:08] sudden and uh and so I'm said that's
[1:22:11] good that's good that'll preach right
[1:22:13] there yes sir and so you know I'm gonna
[1:22:15] go along with that well then then he he
[1:22:17] capped it off and he should have said
[1:22:19] this because the screen zooms in on his
[1:22:22] face and he looks down at us you're
[1:22:25] fixing to ride on one of the why don't
[1:22:27] they said fix him probably something
[1:22:29] like that and he said he said you're
[1:22:31] about to ride on a state-of-the-art 3d
[1:22:36] surround blah blah blah and all the
[1:22:38] technology that was into this simulator
[1:22:40] and you're going to experience what it's
[1:22:44] like to go past the speed of sound and
[1:22:50] and I'm going a men got a witness and
[1:22:57] then he says do you have what it takes
[1:23:02] to beat the demon they should have said
[1:23:06] that oh Jesus I said amen amen
[1:23:15] well my wife got read my kids started
[1:23:18] turning around old God you know here's
[1:23:22] Dada Dada Dada I couldn't help myself if
[1:23:27] it's so good Oh get me in there
[1:23:32] oh I wouldn't a philip looking
[1:23:38] experienced this man and and and and so
[1:23:42] we went through the whole thing it
[1:23:42] wasn't all that great but really you
[1:23:45] know because I mean we experienced all
[1:23:48] them we never got that far off the
[1:23:49] ground that's why I'm talking now and it
[1:23:51] was just a simulator well I needed a
[1:23:54] stimulator big difference and so so
[1:23:59] brother Brown takes this and says do you
[1:24:02] have what it takes to break through that
[1:24:05] sin barrier well in ourselves we don't
[1:24:09] in our in myself I don't have the power
[1:24:12] but he has the power and we pairing that
[1:24:16] the technology by them said what do you
[1:24:19] see happening in the natural is what God
[1:24:22] is doing in the supernatural so if what
[1:24:25] God if man has broken those sound
[1:24:28] barriers Haven and God has a way he has
[1:24:32] a vehicle he has a device that will get
[1:24:36] you and I beyond that barrier so that
[1:24:39] everything else is behind us hey man so
[1:24:42] that we're looking limitless power
[1:24:44] oh my he says we're told that when a
[1:24:48] plane passes the sound barrier it's
[1:24:51] unlimited in its speed and power God if
[1:24:56] we could break through the power of
[1:24:58] unbelief miracles and things and
[1:25:01] promises of God are unlimited for all
[1:25:04] things are possible to him that believes
[1:25:14] he breaks through fails he's broken
[1:25:21] every barrier every veil nothing could
[1:25:26] hide his presence when people gets
[1:25:30] hungry in their heart there's a veil
[1:25:32] ready to be broke you can just depend on
[1:25:37] that rent every veil by his great holy
[1:25:42] spirit
[1:25:43] oh my are you hungry tonight though you
[1:25:47] just are you just looking for God to
[1:25:49] come on the scene and break the veils of
[1:25:52] unbelief break the barriers of sin break
[1:25:55] the chains of bondage amen to break the
[1:25:58] grip of Satan he says since the
[1:26:02] crucifixion when that veil was rent from
[1:26:05] top to bottom for that generation Jesus
[1:26:09] was that God veiled when he died at
[1:26:13] Calvary God sent fire and lightning and
[1:26:17] ripped that veil from top to bottom that
[1:26:21] the mercy seat was in plain view but
[1:26:24] they were too blind to see it as Paul
[1:26:27] said when Moses is read yet that veil is
[1:26:30] still on their hearts oh brother sister
[1:26:33] that's what the Jews did when the veil
[1:26:36] was rent and brought into plain view
[1:26:38] hanging on the cross he was in plain
[1:26:40] view but they couldn't see it could it
[1:26:43] be possible that the Gentiles has done
[1:26:47] the same thing Oh God when they've had
[1:26:51] the church ages the son of God but when
[1:26:54] ow the veil of denominations and things
[1:26:58] this veil of tradition that we've got
[1:27:00] since Pentecost when the church
[1:27:02] traditions has been rent the things of
[1:27:05] the the people has said in the days of
[1:27:08] miracles is past and the things that God
[1:27:10] has took the veil off of it and brought
[1:27:13] it into plain view and they're ready to
[1:27:15] crucify and again just exactly like they
[1:27:20] did so now we come to a place where
[1:27:23] brother hams tell us that they had the
[1:27:26] Church of God that the Son of God
[1:27:28] through the church agents but then right
[1:27:31] at the when it was time of restitution
[1:27:35] has come upon them and the time of the
[1:27:39] other of the of the the the the
[1:27:41] comforter that kind of the consolation
[1:27:44] as Simeon said he was looking for the
[1:27:46] consolation of Israel and here was
[1:27:50] Christ had broken the veil of the matrix
[1:27:53] and had come
[1:27:54] the child to be circumcised of the
[1:27:57] eighth day and here comes Simeon honey
[1:27:59] took that baby in his horns and he said
[1:28:02] yeah I can depart in peace
[1:28:05] a man Eric and departed Peaks brother
[1:28:08] Eamonn why him because Haman I have seen
[1:28:13] thy salvation what was it it was a
[1:28:18] changing of the administration's was a
[1:28:23] changing and so brother Ron says we've
[1:28:26] had the church the son of God down to
[1:28:28] the church ages he said but when those
[1:28:32] denominational systems are condemned huh
[1:28:36] he said it'll be word and word only he
[1:28:41] comes over one page later and says I
[1:28:45] condemn those denominational systems I
[1:28:49] indict them for the second crucifixion
[1:28:51] of Christ and so what they didn't
[1:28:54] recognize what happened
[1:28:55] when the veil back in the days of the
[1:28:58] Lord Jesus was writ and the Paschal Lamb
[1:29:00] was hanging out of the cross and they
[1:29:03] crucified the Lord of glory or but let
[1:29:06] me tell you he's breaking through
[1:29:08] another veil here to the Holy of Holies
[1:29:13] hallelujah or what is it but the
[1:29:15] denominational systems haven't seen it
[1:29:18] they've rejected it but now he's
[1:29:21] breaking through another veil oh man
[1:29:24] what was it it was Malachi for look hey
[1:29:31] man this is from the new living I'm
[1:29:34] sending you the prophet Elijah before
[1:29:39] the Great and dreadful day of the Lord
[1:29:42] so we see something here Malachi 3 was
[1:29:46] before the Lord Himself Malachi 4 is
[1:29:49] before the Lord's bride home I want to
[1:29:53] introduce Christ want to introduce the
[1:29:56] bride hallelujah oh but what was Malachi
[1:30:00] 4 as John was sitting in that day
[1:30:04] as an icebreaker to make way for Christ
[1:30:07] then so is brother Branham said and this
[1:30:10] day to break through the denominational
[1:30:13] systems to set us free from from the so
[1:30:17] that the god of history can become the
[1:30:19] god of the present as Malachi 3 made way
[1:30:24] for the ship of Christ to bring forth
[1:30:26] precious cargo
[1:30:28] amen to deliver the people from their
[1:30:30] sins
[1:30:31] so did brother Branham come to break the
[1:30:35] ice
[1:30:35] amen to break through so that the ship
[1:30:38] called the old ship of Zion who's
[1:30:41] carrying precious cargo even you even
[1:30:44] you amen
[1:30:46] so he can make its way into the portals
[1:30:49] of glory he said otherwise I've come and

[1:30:57] you look at the at the amplified version
[1:31:00] of that you find that he is going to
[1:31:03] smite the earth with a curse that's
[1:31:05] inevitable it's already been spoken it's
[1:31:09] already been pronounced but I send you
[1:31:13] Elijah the Prophet amen to restore your
[1:31:16] hearts back to the faith of the
[1:31:18] Apostolic fathers so that you can put
[1:31:21] forth another branch home and to bring
[1:31:23] forth a rapture amen and then the curse

[1:31:47] grip hallelujah oh my he's here tonight
[1:31:52] that same Jesus oh my my mind goes back
[1:31:57] to a day when there was a couple of
[1:31:59] disciples and they were the Apostle Paul
[1:32:03] had got a vision from God to go to
[1:32:07] Macedonia and so he told his partner
[1:32:14] there brother Silas he said
[1:32:17] I've got a mission from the Lord I got
[1:32:22] to go to Macedonia
[1:32:24] they said well brother Paul go anywhere
[1:32:26] you want to go you know after all you
[1:32:31] know you've got the message all right so
[1:32:37] they got over there they wasn't there no
[1:32:38] time they was thrown in jail
[1:32:42] well Paul so much for your vision you
[1:32:48] know well you missed it on that one here
[1:32:53] we are in jail they're probably going to
[1:32:54] kill us
[1:32:55] hang in there on old rusty chains
[1:32:59] cockroaches and rats and every other
[1:33:01] kind of thing and human wastage all
[1:33:04] around them and the stench of death and
[1:33:06] oh my just a horrible place and so now
[1:33:12] then they got to a certain place it
[1:33:16] looked like it was all all bit lost and
[1:33:19] so midnight came around

[1:33:29] let's just praise him in the night so
[1:33:32] just when all things go wrong that's the
[1:33:35] best time to just praise the Lord amen
