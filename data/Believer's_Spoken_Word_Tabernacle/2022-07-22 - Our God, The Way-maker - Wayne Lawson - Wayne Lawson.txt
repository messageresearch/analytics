song you you made a way when our backs were against the wall and it's looked as if it was over you you made a way and we're standing here only because [Music] how many times has he did it for you amen i i certainly know that he's that kind of god tonight isn't he amen and it's certainly good to be here on a thursday evening and amen and trust that you've come to get something from the lord tonight and i know that he's the god who meets expectations and a prophet said that if we come expecting he said god would meet our expectations and he said if we come looking for something to criticize he said the devil will meet your expectations so we want to be sure we god's the one meeting the expectations amen amen we uh want to say god bless you thank you brother samuel for the opportunity to speak for you tonight and amen we pray that it'd be a blessing to the church and so we we just want to tonight maybe just to bow our hearts and a word of prayer amen heavenly father we're so honored to be here among your people tonight lord and lord together together in your gates with praise and thanksgiving and lord that our voices lifted to you god you were so attracted by it the lord you had angels and you had the stars and the sky and the sun and the trees and lord none of them have failures none of them has ever failed but lord you would rather hear the voice of this people in their praise and worship of you you bowed yourself out of the heavens to lend ear tonight just to hear them sing of the grace and the goodness that you've been to them lord you've been so good you've been so merciful to us you've given us so much lord and we just want to take a moment here lord and thank you we want to thank you lord that you that great creator would take time lord to come by our way and speak to us and meet our needs and lord you'd give us so many good things and lord we owe you our everything the breath that's in our body lord the words that are in our mouth lord so i just pray tonight that you would help us lord as we would try to get out of the way lord that you could speak to this congregation of people lord you're blessed redeemed and i pray you'd bless them tonight i i pray lord if they come here tonight with a burden on them i pray the fire of god would come in this room lord that you would touch the need maybe that mother that's been nervously praying and something very heavy on her heart i pray the answer would come lord i pray that the daddy lord has been seeking a better way i pray god you just come this evening and lord you do what nobody can do show yourself alive among his father and we'll give you all the honor and praise in jesus name amen and amen and god bless you if you have your bibles tonight we'd just like to go into the word of the lord and the book of isaiah the 55th chapter amen uh if i could maybe you could give me a little bit in the ear mike i'm going to go to isaiah 55 and verse 8. verse 8 and then i'll read down to verse 11. for my thoughts are not your thoughts and neither are your ways my ways saith the lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and returneth not tether but waters the earth and make it to bring forth and bud that it may give seed to the sore and bread to the eater soul shall my word be that go forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that what i please and it shall prosper in the thing or unto i sent it amen we ask the lord to bless his word tonight as you may be seated amen we want to greet you all of course from brother erickson and the church at true word there and amen brother samuel said i'm just going to be at home tonight so i'm just going to be at home and and and just act like i'm at home so amen we're going to greet you and then i'm just going to go into this word and and speak a few things here that's been on her heart and i want to speak to you tonight if i can i i want to talk to you about our god the waymaker our god the waymaker amen and i i just want to maybe just share a few things from here tonight and uh i i would look here at a prophet uh in 1963 he preaches a sermon entitled there's only one provided way for anything amen and i i just enjoyed the title there's only one provided way for anything amen so in paragraph 45 he'll say this there is one way to do anything and that's god's way there is one way to do it and that's god's way and outside of that it's all off because it will not reproduce itself again if i got scriptures for these things to prove it amen now in god's provided way for this day he says god always had a way and there are two ways that's our way and his way god has a way for today he's always made a way for everything and again uh healing and what sickness is 1950 your way and my way is wrong and god's way is always right and there's something brother brahm said now there's two ways there's your way and there's god's way and brother brahm said your way is always wrong now that's a good way to start it amen we're just all wrong amen amen it's always wrong see now watch a prophet he'll say it like this now there's two ways a man can go and that's his way or god's way and that's the right way or the wrong way that's that's that's putting her right down there isn't it it's either that way or the wrong way and your way is always the wrong way and god's way is the right way and you can't be in your own way and in god's way at the same time isn't that something you can't be in both at the same time you either in god's way or you're in your way amen and if you're in your way tonight let me just say it right out it's wrong amen but there is a way that's right and god always provides a way and that way is god's way amen so if you brother brahman said it like this he said you can't be in your own way and in god's at the same time so you've got to get out of your own way so god can have his way amen that's that's god's provided way amen now here again in god's provided way he said if you're going your way you're out of god's way and if you cease from your own way you can get in god's way and god can have his way when you cease to have your way but as long as you're having your way god can't have his way so you have to get into one or the other so let's just get out of our own way drop it tonight and let's let god have his way amen i'll tell you we ought to just let go and let god amen just let him have his way amen again god's provided way for as long as you're in your way you're out of his way so forsake your way so one time he tells us to cease from it another time he says drop it and now he's going to tell us amen that we need to forsake it and he used the scripture forsake your thought forsake everything and just rely on thus saith the lord that's right see amen there's there's a way that god has and there's a way that we have and we either need to drop it let it loose cease from it forsake it in other words there would be no reason to hold on to our own way if god's made one because when god provides a way everything that we need amen is a provided way and there's a provision in it that god has provided for the church amen now the prophet will tell us this he said well that's a way in this age that we're living in you've got to find god's way of doing it for the age and that's what martin luther found and that's what john wesley found and that's what the pentecostals found in their age you've got to find god's age and time to do it you've got to find god's age and the time to do it so if you want to be very effective in your life and the time that we're living you've got to find out what god has provided for the day and then walk in that provision then get in the way that god has done it you know i think it's a powerful thing myself because anytime you find god's way then you're finding that god is behind what you're doing it's not just you trying to do it but it's what god is doing in it you know sometimes you see people who are frustrating their own selves because they're trying to try to do things and they try and they really work hard but they're working in their own way of doing it and by doing that they're frustrating the grace of god amen and god can't even do it for them because they got their own mind it's got to be this way or it's got to happen like this it kind of reminds me of a farmer you know maybe maybe a farmer decides he's gonna he's gonna just break the mold and he's gonna have a corn crop in the middle of bay so he goes out in december in ohio and tries to plant some corn well i'll tell you this god provided a way to have a corn crop and you're never going to get it planting it in december and harvesting in may you're going to have to plant it in may and harvest it in august because that's the way god provided it for it to happen and if you work in that provision amen then that then the very law will work for you amen and you you don't have to do anything to put the seed in the ground and let the water come on it and it'll just take place amen and there's things that god has for you tonight in your life that this word of god is a seed and if it's planted in the season that god has anointed it for you don't have to work your head off you've got to plant the seed and begin to water amen that seed with the praise of god and you'll find there's an abundance and a harvest and a revelation that comes to the church of god who's walking not in their own way have forsaken their way and they walk it in the way of god now see you've got to find god's way of doing it and i believe god's way of doing it in this age has always spoke by a prophet of god god's way of doing anything has been spoken in his word now there's two ways i always like to remember these two words always and only if you amen and i probably told you before i'm going to tell you again always and only saying with me always and only god always and only reveals his secrets by a prophet god always and only reveals his secrets by a prophet so god's way would be given to us in this age through a prophetic word it would not come through denomination it's not going to come through independence amen some of the independence is actually worse than the denominations some of the denominations are more grounded scripturally than some of the independents when they get away from a prophet i i have to be honest sometimes you hear guys hey man get around the message and start studying brother brown next thing you know man they got us so far out in la la land amen that we're out in the millennium and amen and the rapture is already over and amen and here we are in these bodies fighting this fight and i'm thinking i'm a disappointed guy if this is a millennium because i was i was for sure i'd have an immortal body amen you you see the promises of the scripture amen but if if you leave headship you can go anywhere as i often say it like this amen when you get into an astronaut age you leave the gravity of the earth can i say denominations or a bit of gravity at least and they keep people in fundamentals of scripture and things but if you're going to get in the message and you're going to leave gravity of denomination and you're going to get in the heavenlies he meant what happens to an astronaut who loses his tether to the spaceship in heavens if if an astronaut's up in the heavens and he gets out of his spaceship and he's not tethered anymore he'll float off anywhere he'll just go off somewhere hey man there's a never-ending amen and so is it today you come out in the message but if you don't stay tied to the word of god he meant in this age to a prophetic voice people are liable to teach anything hey they'll teach we don't need more miracles they'll teach we don't need the holy ghost they'll teach amen there's no more worship no more praise they'll teach we don't even need preachers in the pulpit anymore amen and god has a way of doing everything and it always and only comes through a prophet so to walk in god's way we've got to walk under the message of the hour that we've been placed here to walk in now i i i don't know sometimes i find out that it's just a little easier to be simple than it is to be a is to be a great big somebody amen i'll tell you this some people sometimes somebody called me simple here a while back and and i i actually thanked him for it you know because uh because i read the scripture where the bible said blessed are they that are meat for they shall inherit the earth but ram said that word meek is simple amen they shall inherit the earth do you know who that melchizedek came to in the days of abraham do you know who elohim spoke to in the days of abraham and said amen i can't hide anything from you abraham because you are heir to the earth and that's why the revelation came to abraham because he was heir of the earth and so are we connected in romans 4 with the same promise and the promises under abraham's seed come on we're supposed to have redeemed bodies in a redeemed earth in a redeemed heaven amen we're not just we're not just out here floating around there's some promises for the church of the living god and you know in simplicity i just sometimes find things and and i'm i mean you know we grew up in arkansas i seen a lot of chickens in my time and hey man we we've seen we've seen a lot of chickens and we gathered eggs and we killed chickens and we've you know i mean we've had the farm experience but you know something i've lived i've lived i'm nearly 50 years old now amen and from the time that i've been a little kid and in this great civilization of advanced science do you know that they have not found a better way for a chicken to be born than to hatch out of an egg they just ain't found a better way you you you know what the prophet said about it right but the man said i don't care how long we go if that's god's way you'll never find a better way is that right there's not a better way amen now the prophet teaches us in that that's where brother brown brings in uh how to peep out of an egg y'all remember that he said you got a peep out of the egg and he talks about the little chicken he said he's in the in the egg and he's got to come out of the shell he's got to peep his way out well the only the best way and the only way for a chicken to get out of an egg is to peep his way out of that it's to it's to break out of it and and to think about it that god provides him with everything he needs to do it inside the egg nobody has to break the egg open and put something in there for that chicken to get out of there god gave him a little beak and when he starts developing his beak it's there and he can hit that egg with his beak from the inside and and he gets stronger every time he hits it and by the time he gets out he can live in the outside world because it took something to break through it listen i find they meant that if you just help somebody all the time and they don't have to work through no struggles hey man you get somebody that can't overcome they can't overcome somebody didn't shake my hand or amen or or somebody didn't sing my psalm you know but if you ever get somebody that's peeped out amen and they and they've overcome they broke out of the shell amen they got some resistance on the inside of them that they're able to live on the outside of this world and i'll tell you amen god has a way of doing it and you're never going to get better than god's way of doing it is that right now how do they get out there they get out of that through that beak is that right so how does the church going to get out of their situations by the word they're going to get out of that and what word is that that's the word of faith the word of the hour that is preached in this age and it's going to get them out now think of this because amen you and i can break them out of the egg but we can build an atmosphere that is conducive to life even when it's in the egg and i pray to god amen amen that the church of the living god keeps an atmosphere of the holy ghost where young chickens young eagles can be birthed he meant into the word of god and come out in this age now there's not a there's not a better way to do it amen it just ain't going to have no better way i find out this brother branham said it he said it like this he said if you'll take it for for an example he said if you'll take this example of making a point that's god's way for a christian to be born he says not that he'd walk up to an altar and give a man his right hand and put his name on the book but get down there and peep and cry and beg and plead until god gives you some strength and you've got to come forth out of the shell of this word if somebody maybe a pastor just cracks the shell to take it out he said we'll take you out in anyhow he said you're dead that's all there is to it he says you've got to come god's way and that's the rest of them had to come that way by being born to the spirit of god stay there how long until he told them first group of pentecostals to carry in jerusalem he said until don't make no difference one day five days nine days whatever it is stay there till you're filled with the spirit of god you see that's god's provided way because amen we all looking for specials on everything i mean in the age we are we're looking for a special we're looking for the clearance we're looking for the i mean you can buy the boat but but let's look till we can buy it cheaper amen amen we can buy the suit but let's look till we buy it cheaper listen we're not god's not running any clearance sales on a new birth that you're not going to cheapen this gospel to a handshake it'll take a death and it'll take a lie and it'll take a resurrection amen and it's no blue light specials amen it'll cost you the same thing it costs brother samuel it'll cost you the same thing it costs we implant them amen and it's a death to ourselves and that's god's way of doing it i know i know death is messy amen but it takes death to bring life and when a man dies there's a new birth a resurrection that god will bring upon the scene amen i don't care where it is or where it's about brother brown said it's a mess a baby born on a pile hard floored pink decorated hospital room it's a mess a burst of a calf a birth of anything is a mess and the new birth is nothing less i i would like preacher sermon sometime nothing less than a mess amen wouldn't that make a sermon title nothing less than a mess listen amen i know it's a mess but life comes out of it amen life sustaining life life that'll keep you your rest of your entire being when william brandon went through the trials of his life and lost his wife lost his baby brother man said i didn't even have one human reason to serve god he said god wouldn't talk to me and the devil did and he said the devil let me know i didn't have one human reason to serve god he said but down in there was a birth and out of that birth came the lord give and the lord taketh and blessed be the name of the lord and i believe tonight we might be going through a struggle and a hard season of the church of the living god but them that have a birth and something on the inside of you and said blessed is the name of almighty god amen i'll tell you this it's god's way it's god's way to shout yourself through a trial it's god's way to praise yourself through the walls and dispensations and hard times it's god's way he meant to wave your hand until the atmosphere breaks and the power of god comes in the church this is god's way of doing things i know amen i know there's more more eloquent ways to do it but it ain't god's way it ain't god's way [Music] no no i think of how brother brahm says that he said the new birth is nothing less than a mess he said but people get so starchy we'll go over and shake hands we'll go over there where they where they don't bawl and cry and beat on an altar and cry out now listen to brother brown you want to be too human but what we need is a birth a dying to bring forth life now now this is listen right here this will get you hey man if you this is a prophet saying these things this is what he says here he said a man or woman can never have a new birth until the intellectuals and their own self is rotten dead and die out die out at an altar this is what he says scream get all messed up to a place the starks gets out of your collar then you get borned again by the spirit of god now listen how he says it i think it's amazing i don't care if you squall speak in tongues jump up and down flop like a chicken with your head off have you ever seen no chicken flop around we used to cut their heads off and i was kids you know amen for it i think people probably had a more uh humane way to do it but you know kids amen amen my brothers they just loved it and the old chicken just flopped around and yelled ahead but it's just out there flopping and the prophet amen saw that and said that a son or daughter of god at the altar he don't care if you flop like a chicken with its head off now now i i don't i don't want to get into debates and theologically and all these things only thing i'm saying amen it seems like some people just don't read the quotes anymore if they got such a starchy intellectual idea of how a man comes to god you got to come a proper way you know sane and sensible and you got to shake hands maybe on the right side and you've got to do all come on church hey man since when did we become such a theological place that the baptism of the holy ghost is not welcome with the power and demonstration and the changing of almighty god well i'll tell you what amen i'd rather be dumber than a box of rocks and have the power of god in my life and to have a college education from every college in the country amen what we need is god back in the church we need god back in the meeting we need god back in the home we need god back in the heart and the way god comes is when we die to ourselves and the amen and get out of the mess we're in but we've substituted it because we want a classical way you don't think brother brown didn't know how to touch a spirit listen here he says where's thy strength going he said no we know the bible teaches the new birth but they've substituted for handshakes and everything else for the new birth but it'll never take the place of the new birth it's got to be an experience born again we all know any kind of birth is a mess amen it's a mess of course but it brings life amen now the prophet said i know you get it from the altar boohoo in and slobbering but it brings life it takes a starch out of you it makes you something you ought to be it takes the world and the stiff neck out of you isn't that beautiful brother brown was saying that's what we need we need to get humiliated in the anointing until we lose the starch and the stiff collardness and i'm somebody and i'm from somewhere and we're just a bunch of hillbillies amen they heard a prophet teach something and the power of god pulled us off amen somewhere in the world and made us preachers and i tell you this amen i'm proud of the god i serve come on church i am i'm proud to see god come down in the church and baptize our young people fill them with the anointing of god there's nothing greater in my life and to see god visit a church until the power of god strikes hearts and lives and changes the situation and i know we've come to that age of maturity people say well by the way we want the word well what do you think the word's going to produce y'all know where i'm going some of y'all could preach this sermon hey man brother ma'am said she she don't want them screaming hollering blabbering acts 2 38 miserable creatures that she thinks they are well it would certainly embarrass her it would ruin her educated ethical scientific society church she belongs to they'd throw her out at the next council because she can't have it she don't want to be pregnant with the word because that's the only kind this word could bring forth whoa oh we're just going to teach the words what kind of words you're teaching come on church i have to be i have to be straight honest if a teacher teaches this message and there's no anointing on it what message is he teaching because this is the most dynamic thing that's ever hit the planet earth come on church this is the most powerful thing that has ever struck the earth and if you can preach this message without somebody shouting amen i doubt you're preaching the message of the hour because this message demands an amen this prophet's message demands a hallelujah this is the word of the lord and just removable the cat stone has returned to the church shouting crying grace grace i can hear the bible prophesy and say rejoice ye o daughters of zion thy king cometh what is this message this ain't just some some little baptist sermon it's not some little church of christ sermon has it's the power of the resurrected jesus christ back in the church of the living god with manifestation and power and anointing now the prophet of god said born of the spirit of god it has the spirit of god in it no intellectual church joining creed joining bob's hair painted face there's no such thing at all you don't find that in the word of god but you do find an old-fashioned sanctified holy ghost-filled child born of the spirit of god screaming hotter and shouting and praising god what do you find in the word you see what the prophet's saying what they what they were trying to introduce as a god's bride brother brahm said you can't find that in the word he said but this this bunch of people who you're rejecting because they believe in the movement of the spirit of god he said i can find that in the word but i can't find that intellectual nonsense in the word of god and i'll tell you what i'm going to stand where a prophet stood amen i don't want my way i want god's way and god's way is that the holy ghost would birth the church [Music] well ducks and geese or ducks and geese oh hey man you know ducks and geese no yeah i mean come on y'all hey man they've been doing it for years y'all y'all know we live here in the north and them old ducks they'll go down every south every winter they do it every winter geese will fly down every winter they'll do it every time brother brown said now you try he said you try to go cage them up and haul them down there he said god why would you want to go cage them up and hold them down there god provided a way to get them down there and do you know that god has provided that way and generation after generation after generation they do the same thing every time brother brahm said it he said he said can you imagine one fall that the duck rose up and begin to say honk honk honk he said somebody turns around says ah we don't do that anymore the ducks don't fly anymore that's that's the same as saying the church of the living god don't worship anymore the church of the living god don't feel the anointing anymore listen that's our flight path that's the pattern of the church that'll get us back in the presence of god it's the instinct is the god-given instinct now here's the beauty of it is brother ma'am said you'll not find a better way to get him down there he said matter of fact you won't find a better route for him to go won't be a better route for him to go he said you could plan it out he said but you wouldn't get them there any better than what god's got them out of there because god's got them god's got them going where he can get them around the storms he knows right where the food is he knows exactly where they can land and how they can land because it's a root now brother branham now if you i don't take time to read these things but if you go back and listen to it god's only provided flame for anything in chicago brother man will go into this point and he'll say the only way for them to get back where their ancestors went is to go god's root the church is trying to get back to an upper room experience and the only way for the church to get back where our ancestors our apostolic fathers are we've got to take the same route that they took come on y'all know i'm telling you the truth amen we brother bam said it like this he said we get up here and talk about what god was he said that ain't no different painting a picture for somebody about a fire now you know hey man i i don't know about y'all hey man but i've never been worn by painting fire i've never been burnt by painted fire hey man painting fire don't do nothing for nobody is that right amen but what we find is people today putting out the fire of god and painting a picture of the other day god used to god did god would and someday god will well i believe god is god right here tonight i believe this thursday night right here that the power of god can come into this church and birth children save children deliver children that miracles could take place in this building tonight because my god is the god of a waymaker and we have found the path that takes the church back to its apostolic father listen i'm not looking for the path tonight i found the path yeah come on church you're walking on the same trail that a prophet walked on you're walking on the same trail that enoch walked on if you keep walking this trail one of these mornings you're gonna get closer to home amen and god's going to change your body we're not looking for it we have found the redemption of the age that we have come to this is not an age where we're just hunting the will of god we've had a prophet among us we have thus saith the lord it's beautiful brother brown says you'll never find a better leader for them geese you'll never find a better leader than the one god provides god provides a leader that's the best one you can get god provided you brother samuel here in this church that's god's pastor for this for this church you'll not find a better one than the one god gave you you just ain't gonna find it if god gave him to you that's the best god's got hey man i tell you it's a powerful thing to see a church rally around the gift that god puts among them you can see supernatural you can see miraculous you can see the power of god and all you've got to do is water the word that is preached and the gift will operate and god will move into it it's god's way ah i say that because i know there are those amen who who have crept into the message and tried to take away the liberty amen press pastor shouldn't even preach anymore and you know sit down and i i guess we get our orders from some headquarters somewhere so i think prophet god said this church only got one headquarters and it's in heaven so i don't know anybody in the other headquarters come on might as well just make rome your headquarters if you're gonna have one it's the same exact spirit you might as well just bypass them and go to the big dad it's the truth you see what is going on is you can't have god's way in your way at the same time god's way is to anoint a minister and put him in the platform and preach the word of god and an anointing comes in the room and it saves and seals and delivers and heals and it's god's way i tell you i can read it from paul he said by the foolishness of preaching by the foolishness of preaching men are saved isn't it something that if god got a leader that's the best leader you can get now watch watch jesus say my sheep know my voice and a stranger they'll not follow the prophet picks this up amen and he speaks about that he says see there's not a better see you're not going to get a better leader for the geese than the one god put out in front not gonna get a better leader for the duck than the one god put out front not gonna get a better leader for the church than the one god put out front that's god's way of doing it now the prophet of god says it like this he said do you see here we are here we are 2 000 years later he said and we're looking for a messiah to hold this thing together the world is looking for a leader right now to hold this world together now i don't have time to preach about the politics of this age amen but i think some people think we found the messiah amen they've got they got things the way they want them and if you're looking to bring in well well anyhow amen but but here's the thing that the world is looking for a messiah that's what they're that's what they're hunting is the messiah see but the world wants their messiah but god sends the messiah do you see that the world wants politics as a messiah they want and you can't walk in your way and god's way at the same time now there's only one leader going to bring peace to this world there's only one leader going to fix it all his name is jesus christ that's the only leader that's going to fix the problems that we have but his spirit has descended in this age to become the king of this bride before this bride ever gets to millennium listen when we get in the millennium we're not going to change presidents we're not going to change kings amen we're already under the king who will rule the new heavens and the new earth oh we are the new creation of god and every one of you is a king in the kingdom of god amen i'll show you the scripture if you want it david was a king over a band of nobodies for a long time before he was king sitting on the throne he was anointed of god and they followed him because he was a coming king but they never changed kings when they anointed david on the throne of jerusalem their king coming to power he had always been their king and jesus christ is the king of the saints tonight amen in one of these days they're going to put him in power and my king is coming in power in the millennium brother yes sir i'm a jesus man yes i'm a jesus freak i believe in the corporal body of jesus christ i believe in nelshart hands i believe in the physical return of our lord jesus where he'll set up a lineal reign upon the earth yes i believe that yes i believe that but he his spirit is here tonight it's here as a king brother man said they're looking for a messiah to hold a thing together they're praying for a messiah paragraph 130. but here's what i want to say if he would come would we receive him would we do like they did and refuse him what we must realize skipping down we must realize and do not understand what we need we think we do but god promised to supply our need and he'll do it so the world gets to thinking what we need to lead and god says he'll give you what you need do you see god ain't giving you what you want he's giving you what you need amen and what we need was a messiah that's what we needed and the prophet of god said they're praying for messiah they want a messiah that's what it is they want a messiah in paragraph 133 he said see what it is he said they'll do it again the same thing today they'd refuse it again if god sent the messiah they'll refuse it because it don't come their way they don't come the way they want it so they just don't take it we want a messiah so the messiah comes and they won't wash his feet do you see what it is that very request brother graham said ask before god god sent it to us and we refuse it falling apart world falling apart brother braham said what we need today is a message see we see what he says what we need maybe not what we want what we need is a message anointed with the messiahship of christ he said but would they receive it they pray for it but would they receive it no sir they wouldn't receive it they would crucify like they did in the first place now today the crucifixion's not taking place at calvary it's taken place in the pulpits because they're crucifying the effect of the messiah that is here to lead by his word brother brahm says it i i think these are powerful quotes he said we cry for such a person god would send us a deliverance but we've got to receive it in the way that he sends it they didn't do it they didn't want it that way the church cries oh heavenly father will you please send jesus to us will you please and when the holy spirit begins to move they don't want it will you send jesus but when the holy spirit begins to move they don't want it come on y'all know that jesus in john 14 he said yet a little while and the world see me no more but you will see me for i will be with you even in you now it sounds like it's different than the holy ghost because in john 14 he begins by saying i'll go away and he'll come unto you the spirit of truth and he'll comfort you it's the way he says it but then he turns around and says for i'll go away and then i'll come again and i'll be with you even in you so we're not trinitarians we believe in one god and that one god is jesus christ and his spirit is here tonight so when you receive the holy ghost you're not receiving a different jesus you're receiving jesus christ in the spirit of his resurrection that's exactly how paul met him paul never met him in the flesh but he met him in the after and the resurrection as a pillar of fire and he said lord who are you said i am jesus who is this among us then this great pillar of fire who is this among us that has visited our generation who is this that comes down and moves through our sanctuaries on a thursday night and stirs our heart to an amen to a hallelujah to a glory to god who is this i tell you who it is it's none other than jesus christ the son of god and i say that he's not dead tonight i say that he's alive and resurrected power is here in this building tonight then we've not received just a spirit whereby we're going to try to make things happen and we're going to try to build things up listen the spirit we have received has already conquered hell the spirit that i've got has already conquered every disease he's conquered every temptation he raised up on the third day and after 2 000 years he is still conquering diseases and demons and powers and he's right here in the house tonight i say we are to wake up jesus we are to wake him up tonight and say god we need you in the church we need him tonight brother ram said some people are looking for a messiah he said it's not some man here the messiah he said it's the spirit of god then the messiah is here then you already go tell your friends come see one we have found the messiah [Applause] not by might not by power but by my spirit saith the lord that's why paul said that where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty and the lord is that spirit it's not a different spirit and the bible even says that if the same spirit that raised up jesus from the dead dwelling you will also quicken will also quicken your mortal body than receiving the holy ghost as an anointing as a spirit then has to deal with your body change you can't have a body change without an experience with the anointing of almighty god hey man now people ain't going to receive it amen but just as it was in that day they didn't receive it there was somebody to receive it and it might have been a little hooker who has had a whale but she had a seed in her that when the messiah come something in her recognized that's a messiah peter couldn't write his name in boxcar letters he was just an old fisherman but when the messiah come he recognized it was him philip recognized nathanael recognized and i believe there's people sitting in this building tonight that have recognized the messiah has come into this earth to lead this bride and exodus they ain't a better leader god ain't got a better leader than the holy ghost and the holy ghost is the anointing on the word that is coming to this age i know people people go on this all the time i i've been called pentecost in the last five years more hey man i don't know why they just keep calling me pentecostal i know what the problem is i've never been in pentecost in my life i never ever ever ever was in a pentecostal church i don't know why they call me pentecostal listen can i just set the record straight amen i did preach in pentecostals church one time and i'll tell you what happened i was in the back room and they were shouting and dancing after songs but the minute i come out and opened up the word that was one of the quietest bunch of people you ever heard i have never seen pentecostals shout on the revelation of seven thunders i have never seen pentecostals child over the preaching of seven seals i have never seen pentecostals shout about eating a book and translating power and malachi 4 but there's something on the inside of you that when you hear the message preached you can't hardly set in your seat because you're not a pentecostal you're a son and daughter of god and it's god's provided way that when christ comes into the building you make known that he is there [Applause] i'll tell you what if he would come today brother said he'd be a word of god manifested word of god a vindicated word of god that's the messiah that's the messiah hey man what is it don't make any mistakes about it friends it's not what i'm saying it's i'm just your brother but it's what god has proven to you that makes it the truth the same pillar fire he used for the other two he's brought it among you today and proved it by scientific proof two exodus is under a pillar of fire and here we are today in the third exodus and the messiah is here to lead it oh god ain't got two ways he did it that way the first time he's doing it that way this time and let me tell you this if you can sit under the pillar of fire and have no emotions amen then there's something going on with you amen but when it comes to me i'm sorry i i just have to be honest as something on the inside of me and the supercharge of the anointing of god begins to move over me it moves my insides now you label that anything you want i don't know you can tag a you can take a roast beef ham if you want to but anybody knows what they're looking at knows the difference oh the preacher doesn't even get in the house some people don't know the difference do they don't know they only know what they're looking at you know what's amazing to me brother brown said that about when those school of prophets was up there with elisha he said he went up there and they was going to make a pottage for him to eat he said and they went out and gathered and some got peas and some got gourds he said the fella that put the gourds in the pot like to kill the whole bunch he said because he didn't know the difference between peas and gourds he said ain't no different today he said than preachers that don't know the difference between fanaticism and the move of the holy ghost amen and they call everything fanaticism but the prophet of god said don't throw the whole pot away he said elisha added some christ to it and fix the whole pot and i tell you what we need we can have our emotions but let's put christ in it we can have our dances we can have a holy ghost move let's put christ in it i can tell the difference i can tell the difference and any anybody got the holy ghost can discern the difference god's system is the holy spirit and the word that's god's system what he's offered you is a kingdom not a denomination he's offered you a kingdom where the word of god has power where it has power to change your life it has power to create atmosphere it has power to set you into the angels dimensions and and puts wings under you fly you out of the darkness this this word has power in this kingdom if you're born in the kingdom of god this word has power to change things it's a powerful thing when you're in this kingdom god has offered this people a kingdom now you're in hebrews 12 remember for we have received a kingdom but we have received a kingdom that shall not be shaken and that kingdom we've received is the word it's god's system it's god's word given by a vindicated prophet let the kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven let the kingdom of god come to us come on church you know it's right for the kingdom of god is without observation i say not here or there but it's within you that's why william branham would stand there and say i'll take every spirit in this building under my control because the kingdom of god had came to the earth a messiah a messiah's kingdom that's why the anointing here in this building tonight is stronger than ever depression it's stronger than every anxiety it's stronger than ever failure in your life i know it's just the thursday nights but the messiah is here in the building tonight he's here to change hearts he's here to change lives it's the anointed word that's come in our midst again and i'll tell you this when he begins to move that's why a prophet could stand there and say every demon is under my control that's why that maniac runned up there to whip brother branham and the spirit come out of it and he fell across brother man's feet your brother brown said you ought to sing the healings and the miracles take place the next few days because the chief devil had been whipped i tell you what this message with the chief devil it whipped the devil into nomination amen it with the devils amen in the in the kingdom can i say it like this william branham slayed the goliath so that the church of the living god can fight this battle and i don't know about y'all i'm not putting down my sword hey we got him on the run we might as well take him after him if one could tell you a thousand two complete ten thousand what a little church like this dude tonight i'll tell you what they're running sirens in hell right now they running sirens in hell right now she's waking up there's something going on up there on that thursday y'all hurry up get up there y'all do something you got to stop this but i'm gonna i want to put a news flash out to the devil i want to sound the trumpet i want them to hear me all the way in hell you will never stop this you will never stop what has been started amen god said i have begun to work and i am the finisher of the work this is the finishers here tonight the finisher of this anointing is here he has come himself to lead us out of this [Music] brother man said anything that pulls you out of the way is a false anointing anything that pulls you away from that is wrong that's a false messiah a false anointing somebody said oh that brother had an anointing he said what kind of anointing he said that's it hitler had an anointing khrushchev got one also pope plus has one he said also what kind of anointing you got if it's not anointed with the word to vindicate every word to be true leave it alone now that's how you know the difference when the anointing is moving because of the word it's not emotionalism amen it's not fanaticism it's the anointed word coming to the earth to birth lives to change hearts now y'all know y'all know how satan built his kingdom don't you how did he do it he he brought another idea into god's kingdom brother braham said by his fallen angels he led them he led them out isaiah saw it and isaiah said why thy father from heaven oh lucifer remember that brother bam said he said for thou have said in thine heart so when isaiah wrote about satan fallen brother brahm said he was looking at the heart of satan he was seeing a vision of what he wanted to be but when paul wrote about it in ii thessalonians paul said he said thou have ascended thyself above the throne of god and brother man said he's there in position now paul is putting him in position now now he's ascended himself above all that's called god now somebody said what's called god then what do you call god brother brahm said in the beginning was the word the word was with god the word was god he said then the word vindicated anything that exalts itself above it is the kingdom of hell see anything that comes in and says well brother branham taught it but i don't really believe this or i don't think this is right or i don't think we ought to be this way that's the kingdom of hell coming against the church but i tell you what he meant somebody needs to open up the door and let the devil out of the building tonight because his kingdom is coming down as the men of god that is left on this earth that's going to tell the church of the living god the kingdom of god is risen up in this age by the prophet of god has brought a word and that word is here to rule supreme in every heart every family every church every life that's what gives the church its authority back it's god's oh it's god's way come on friends it's god's way somebody says well i'm going to get this and i'm going to study that and i'm going to get that it's not god's way god's way is to send the prophet that word is spoken and the bride exceeds it and they have received a messiahship so preacher what are you talking about i'm talking about this god gives us a way to everything we've lost god gave us away your bible reader how many bible readings we got here tonight you know what it says in second corinthians you remember that when it says being that we have this ministry we faint not remember that because it didn't come with us with declaration of words but through manifestation it's what it says amen and it tells us that the gospel if it's hid it is hidden to them that are lost he says unless they would take amen unless they would take the gospel brother man picks it up and says that last l-e-s-t he says exactly what happened in the garden of eden when adam and eve fell he said god put angels around the tree of life to protect the way the way of the tree of life was blocked because god said no man would enter back into this way he said did i make an atonement for it so he blocked the way so they couldn't get to it so what we find is those four anointings that were around the way of the tree of life with a man ox eagle amen they were the lion the man the ox and the eagle is that right amen and now brother branham says the swords that used to hold us out from the tree of life are now leading us back to the tree of life then there's an eagle that has come into this age to open up the way and the tree of life that the church can return to the former glory listen to me we're going back to eden church this message has taken you back to eden conditions i know people think i'm insane but that's all right let me i'm happy like i am so it's not eden it's not you helped me understand that how william branham could stand there and he that's in you and tell the storms to go back and the sun to shine for three days and while he's standing there animals are obeying his voice he said i'm standing in timber that's never been touched it was virgin timber it was a garden he was speaking to the animals he said then i was young and there was my wife she was young again he was walking in the condition hallelujah and the church of the living god is on the same trail we're walking the same road i i not lost my mind i ain't amen how come he could tell them bees to go back into the nest had the first nature they wouldn't have touched him in the garden of eden them bees wouldn't have touched him but the minute there was a fallen nature they wanted to get after him but he had a condition that put him back in the same premises and he told him to go hey that's open to ever believe in this building that's not just for a prophet he made the way that the church could walk therein hey as she begins to walk in that way god has a way if you like to read your bibles revelation 22 the bible actually says that we have a right to the tree of life we have a right to the tree of life how did god restore my goodness i'm going to get out of time for get out of sermon how do we restore the church how do we get the church back god's got a way to do it you say i've lost so much god's got a way to give it back but you've got to come god's way of doing it now okay are you all right we don't preacher you'll want me i can stop right here if you want me to god's got a way god's got a way to do it let me just y'all's gentiles you're gentile people so you have to have representation in the bible and that's a gentile woman do y'all know ruth is one of your representatives so you are ruth how many knows brother bram said every parable in the bible is being manifest now so you're not just going to be ruth you're going to be sheba you're not just sheba you're going to be rahab you're not just rahab you're going to be tamar you're not just tam are you going to be mary you're not just you you see that you're going to be shamgar you're going every word is how you live in this age you're going to pick up an oxnard in one day and you just got to believe the word and the next day all of the bible has been open to this bride [Music] so brother wayne i've lost so much how did i get it all back how did ruth get it how did ruth get it she had a kinsmen redeemer that was god's way to give her back what she had lost her fallen estate when she returned with her mother-in-law they went to they was poor they didn't have anything they returned without the ability to help themselves and the only thing she could do was glean the field that's all she could do glean in the field hey man but what she did was she got in the right field she got right field and the bible said boaz descended into the field one day while she's working ah that's too much to preach isn't there come on we've had a boaz descend in this age while we're working in the field boaz come riding on the vindicated word of god and saw a bride virtuous bride come to find out we was kin to him remember remember remember that naomi hey man she owned property but it had been sold out and she had lost it in the in the holocaust but she's returning now amen but before she ever left moses wrote a law that gave a person a way to get it all back you couldn't get it back any other way but if you come god's way it wouldn't even cost you anything if you come god's way he just gives it back to you remember remember finally ruth starts talking to naomi and come to find out the field she's working in is the kinsmen of naomi and she says to her she says we this man can redeem us this man can put us back into our he can give us back everything that we lost everything that we have been out all this beautiful things are ours and we can't have it but our names on it we just can't get it but this man can give it all back this man can fix all your problems she said what i do said this is the way you do it remember center up there at the harvest and get at the feet of boaz and ask to be redeemed ask him to ask him and when she did she laid at the feet brother bram said which represented the cross how did she know what to do she asked naomi now you know what brother graham said about that don't you he said naomi was the old testament scripture he said so if you'll ask the old testament it'll give you the law of redemption so the old testament teaches us how to be redeemed by the law so that god's way works for us not against us that's one time it's good to be under the law church when the law is giving you back everything you're lost come on bridetree you know where i'm at there's a restoration time and the holy ghost law is here to enforce that everything you lost i tell you what naomi did she instructed her how to get it all back amen and remember what he did he said i'll do it i'll redeem you give her six six bars six uh six sheets of barley send her back she goes back down to the house and he says says dude naomi's damn one says what did he say to you he said he'd do it she said he'd do it he said he'll do it what i do now nothing what do you do now nothing what do you mean nothing he said this is the time you rest because he won't rest until the thing is finished let me tell you something tonight amen it's time for the bride to rest in the word and realize that god will not stop until we have received everything that's been lost our bodies are to be restored our joy is to be responsible our life is to be restored and look at the beauty of this they didn't have nothing they had lost it all but he could give it all back because god has a way to do it i tell you it's a powerful thing this is this is powerful i'm just going to paraphrase instead of reading the scripture to you but but the way you do that is boaz had to actually testify before the elders so he takes ten elders and goes out to the gate of the city stands in the gate and begins to tell them that naomi is my kinsman and this is her daughter-in-law and i'm going to redeem her and marry this woman and now he had to tell 10 elders the law and when he got done they had to admit he's met the requirement of the law so when those elders got done you know what they would say they would say worthy you are worthy of her to be her kinsmen he said preacher why are you on that because in revelation the fifth chapter the act of redemption in the end time is brother branham says the lamb will take the book he said and the first act of redemption is he testifies to the 24 elders of his kinsmanship to this bride so 24 elders are sitting there in heaven and jesus is testifying to them as boaz did in the old testament and he's saying they're my kinsmen i've gave my blood for them i am their kinsmen i am i am fulfilling the law come on church he didn't cheat the law he fulfilled the law and you know what those elders said 24 of them 12 of the old 12 of the new you know what all the elders said they said worthy worthy he's worthy he's worthy to pay the price of our redemption tonight he's worthy that the blood of jesus christ can give you back everything that he promised listen adam forfeited it but jesus has given it back he's provided a way to give it back this message is returning to you everything that's been lost to accept this word is to recept all of your inheritance it's to receive the inheritance of the word and to be put back into the hands of the church the forfeited title deed of redemption meaning that legal possession now is back in the hands of the believers god gave you the word legally and i'm a legal holder tonight meaning i can tell the devil get off of my property i am a legal owner of this possession the preacher what are you trying to say i'm trying to say god made a way how god's way to do it is he used boaz god's way to save man he put jesus at calvary and his blood run that was god's way man's looking and said that's not salvation but it was god's salvation jehovah's elected salvation to save us was jesus christ this is god's way of saving you can try any way you want but that's god's way to do it he said well i want to be restored any way to be restored outside of a prophetic word it's not god's way so i got to accept this prophet if you want restoration if you want to be put back where you come from this word will put you back where you come from it'll put you back you know what it's actually done it's it's gave us it's gave us a very beautiful how could i say this it's give us a very beautiful position as a church in that we're living in a very difficult age but we're literally being placed before the pillar of fire like moses was like job was like abraham was which gave every one of them a disposition of perseverance is that right then the church of the living god has heard the voice of god in the presence of god and now they're ready to go forward in this marching battle now i'm going to say that because if you know you're in the line of duty if you have received god's way and you're walking in this way a position is going to come but that doesn't mean that you're out of the way that means satan's trying to block the way is that right but listen i want you to i want you to know that when moses was leading the children of israel and he was going to the promised land he was right in god's way and he had a entire army behind him and he had a red sea in front of him now y'all got to ask somebody why did god put a man in a pickle like that you're gonna ask somebody why did god do that why would god put a man in that kind of place why would he do it why would god put an entire army behind a man and put a red sea in front of a man and him in charge of two million people women kids and animals and everything else and looked like he was just easy pickings brother man said god put him in that place to prove to you he's a god that makes a way when there is no way he made he made a way when there was no way but he's god and he still makes his way i tell you something tonight you may be facing things that you don't think you can get through but you don't know the kind of gods you're serving you don't realize the power of the god you're serving tonight he can open red seas he can tear down walls he can move mountains he can change bodies he can cause every devil to dissipate at the power of the word of god i tell you something tonight my god is a wave maker and he's here to make a way for you you're sitting here tonight saying brother wayne i'm fighting with everything that's in me just keep fighting because god will make a way you don't think there is but there is a way through it and god has provided the way through it you follow this word and god will make a hole in the wall he'll make a he'll make a he'll make the door open when there is no door open i ever tell you about me and brother isaac overnight in india brother isaac vasuku tomorrow lizard and chennai and he he has a he had a he had a nice home but his church got so big he just turned the church over to the to the to the people and and so they're they're just living in that well he went and bought this little apartment he's got he's got three children and and some of them's already having children his wife and then himself and then i think his mom or something or his dad and there was a bunch of them so they had this one apartment well it wasn't big enough for the family so what they did is a lot of times in india the whole family lived together which if you can get away with that's good for me but but they were living there and so he went and rented he owned that when he rented that to somebody else and he went and rented a bigger apartment and they were all living but it was further from the church so somebody owned the apartment is it called adjacent it's just next door he they lived just the other side of the wall somebody owned that apartment so he talked to me into getting a lease to release that apartment next to his and he's going to put a door in the wall in the main room so that both his whole family can live there and they just pass back and forth through the wall so it's like they had a bigger house you know so they did it they they made the lease they went back moved the apartment got everything settled let the other ones go and just about time they're going to build the hole in the wall somebody calls them and the people that uh on the other apartment are hindu and there was some kind of uh some kind of a superstition amen that they didn't want to put the hole in the wall no more well i was i was there holding meetings and it was like a saturday night i believe it was or no it was probably a sunday night i don't remember but because the next next day it was work week after but i was there that night and we were sitting around the table and sebastian and brother isaac's wife she she was unusually upset i could tell she was just upset so i asked the question and so they explained the whole thing to me well we get up to leave and when i get up to leave walk something just put in my heart you pray for the situation so i told him brothers i said y'all might think i'm silly but i want all of you come here and we went over and stood by that wall where they wanted that hole in that wall we stood there and began to pray and i said lord i don't know what it would take to change that hindu's heart but i know you did it in the days of abraham you spoke to a foreign king and you changed his heart i said maybe you'll give them a dream maybe you'll change their heart but when they wake up in the morning lord make something different make a way put it put a hole in this wall for my sister she's been so kind to the ministers of god and and i said amen got up walked out next morning amen about breakfast time brother isaac calls down at the hotel he said brother and you and not going to believe this he said this morning early the owner of that apartment called and said they said go ahead and put the hole in the wall said something happened to my wife last night and she decided it's just something's just just go ahead and do whatever you want to do i said i'll tell you this god will make a hole in a wall because he's a waymaker and you may be standing against something tonight and you said brother wayne there's no way out of this you don't know the gods you're serving he can make the way where there is no way some of you sitting right here tonight you know good and well if god hadn't made a way you'd never you'd never be sitting in a church like this god made the way and because he's a waymaker here we sit here tonight here we sit in this beautiful church and this time and feeling that because god made a way he made a way brother samuel can our musicians come tonight god made a way because my god he's a waymaker he he makes a way brother man said the greatest experience of my life this is a powerful quote i know brother samuel probably preaches it a lot he says when i walk up to something and it's so high i can't get over it he said it's so low i can't get under it and it's so wide i can't get around it he said and i stand there and watch god make a way through it and i'll tell you tonight if you just trust him get in his way and let him make the way because he's a waymaker could you stand your feet with us tonight he'll make a way when my back was against the wall and it looked as if it was

know that what you've spoken tonight lord like ruth we walk out of this building but god we have received the word from boaz till i will not rest until i have finished the work oh god we we rejoice in that like that little woman that god when she looked at herself unworthy she was not out in the midst of all the rest of the women but she was out there and there was a character that was in her that that son found in her that he couldn't find in the rest and lord she received that promise what power was in that promise that god was able to draw her away from looking to herself from looking at her unworthiness to where god there was a confidence within that word that he said he'd come back to get me about the time of spring she made ready for that lord her way the way that was made was under the inspiration of that word of promise that came to her and lord here we are and to the word of promise and inspiration in this hour it's not i that liveth it's christ that liveth in me it's your working in our lives lord it's you driving about about every doubt and unbelief it's you god moving in our lives this is the power of the word of god in our lives lord how we thank you father we just

i give myself away so you can use me hallelujah thank you lord jesus hallelujah amen how many have enjoyed the word of the lord tonight amen it's grace in this hour that god has come shoutings of grace grace unto it it calls us beyond all reason our reasons fail whether it's looking at the red sea looking at the wall looking at the mountain looking at your own situation our reasons fail but god's word can't fail you know brother bennett made a statement like this remember how many times brother brain would tell the story about that when he was out there worshiping and he heard that elk bugle and all those things was going on brother bram says he began to god directed his attention to that that that chatter and that that eagle brother brown says he looked at that eagle and eventually said that eagle got enough of that chatter and it took off brother brown says it like this in 64 he says this word has wings on it he said this word that has wings on it will make a way out of every situation it has wings on it and it'll cut its way through so no matter what it is listen even let me just say it in the words of how the prophet put it in the prayer letter it's time to doubt your doubts and to believe god's word because what god has said about you is more true than what you think about you and if you just enter into that channel that's the simplicity see the enemy always wants to bring us back into us it's something that we have to do it's not what we have to do if we yield to him he takes us to healing he takes us to deliverance he takes us to the baptism of the holy ghost because he's the enforcer of his word i'll tell you what a what a privilege tonight you know let me just say it you can look at it in your life and say well i don't see the word working but there's a difference is it you handling the word or is it the word handling you you see when god directed samson to pick up the jawbone of an ass samson was not doing that out of enthusiasm but it was a spirit of god that moved down in samson's life that took a hold of the word and satan's desires try to bring frustration that we get out and we're trying to turn around a situation loved one or whatever it is it'll never work because it's our own strength but if we will go in the power of his might if we'll go in his strength that he's supplied to us and just look to god and wait for his anointing and move right in that channel his anointing has come right here tonight how many say amen to that no matter what your need is tonight all you have to do is move right in that channel i believe we've moved in that channel tonight and i believe in moving into that channel that you can take all your frustrations and every failure you can leave that behind you and allow the holy spirit and say god this situation in front of me let your hands be wrapped up on my life amen and let the word of god go to work and produce what he said it would do and then we stand back and say glory be to god he's a waymaker there's no situation that's too big for god there's no situation that you can look at and say that's unredeemable there's no situation that is unredeemable i'm not going to preach but i think we got god has let it be known there's nothing nothing that's greater than god nothing's greater than this situation i'll tell you tonight you couldn't have got more personal if it would have just been god and you in the room that's how personal this message brings jesus christ aren't you glad for that it's a word that gives us strength ministers ability ministers courage to us so don't walk out here with your head down you walk out here with your head up high you have received a word from the king i don't care what you feel like right now that word is working and you yield to that word and that word produces in your life amen [Music] i'm a product of it how many is a product of it i'm a product of it this message works this message works amen it's not the ideas of man this is not this message never come you've heard me say this this message has never come it is not up to me to try to pick out quotes and say this is brother graham's opinion this is brother braham's a thought i don't that's nonsense god has not anointed the ministry in this hour to do that but god has anointed us to preach it is that all right god's anointed us to preach it in any other voice that says any other thing we tune it out because it's an uncertain sound god has vindicated his word in this hour and i'm glad about it i'm glad about it to me it's just it's joy i'm thankful there's a real absolute of the holy spirit that's come in this hour that ties us right back in the word he's a waymaker in me glory be to god hallelujah amen we're going to let you be dismissed in the name of the lord brother wayne thank you for coming amen amen amen amen amen brother wayne's been a real good friend to me been a blessing to us as an assembly and my goodness we just thank god for his grace don't we amen heavenly father we once again want to say thank you we ask god for your blessings on your children as we go our separate ways lord god i pray that you just lord be with each one be with lord those that are traveling on the road lord brother wayne god may you just lord the angels of god that they would be dispatched lord into their place as lord and watching over them and carrying them safely their lord to their destination lord i pray dear god for brothers and sisters lord just seeing brother nathan your lord and many of the saints and god just asking that lord you'll just continue to touch lord and strengthen brother randy loren may you continue to move lord god upon that leg lord god we pray you're still the same god the lord for it's by your stripes we are made whole father lord we love you and we thank you tonight lord go with your children now in jesus precious name amen hallelujah god bless you amen you're dismissed in the name of the lord amen thank you jesus thank you lord thank you [Music] thank you jesus [Music] lord i lift my hands in worship as i bless your holy name you deserve [Music] lord i lift my hands in worship thank you lord and i bless your holy name [Music] there is no one else [Music] there is no one else like you you are great you do miracles [Music] so there is no one else like you [Music] there is no [Music] one else [Music] you deserve the glory [Music]
