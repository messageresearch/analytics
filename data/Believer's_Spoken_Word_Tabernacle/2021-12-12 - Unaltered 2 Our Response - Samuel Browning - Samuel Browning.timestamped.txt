[26:19] you know god's the only one that permits

[26:24] and the devil can't actually do nothing
[26:26] to you unless

[26:31] and surely
[26:32] that scripture is fulfilled
[26:34] that all things work very better
[26:37] though we may understand or not
[26:39] understand it
[26:41] somewhere along the line it's going to
[26:42] work for our good
[26:44] so i just want to give a testimony of
[26:47] what happened to me on
[26:50] i
[26:50] last wednesday a week before i
[26:54] we had just finished working in brother
[26:56] jose's house brother richard and myself
[26:59] and
[27:00] went home went to sam to get some
[27:01] gasoline went to get something to eat
[27:04] and
[27:04] i was eating and all of a sudden my
[27:07] right hand
[27:08] just went
[27:09] totally numb
[27:12] i couldn't pick up this paper
[27:14] that's all i know me was just totally
[27:16] dead
[27:18] wondering what was going on
[27:20] felt a little
[27:21] kind of funny
[27:23] my neck
[27:24] i was having a lot of trouble with my
[27:26] neck
[27:27] had a lot of pain
[27:29] didn't know why
[27:31] so
[27:32] i went through wednesday and then
[27:33] thursday was basically the same i didn't
[27:36] come to the service
[27:38] thursday
[27:39] and then uh
[27:41] friday my wife said let's go to
[27:42] emergency we went to emergency and
[27:45] they uh took me in
[27:48] and
[27:50] gave me an x-ray of my neck
[27:53] and i had
[27:54] a laceration in my one of my main
[27:57] arteries
[27:58] one of my main arteries was leaky
[28:01] um
[28:03] so finally i spent
[28:05] all night at the er and about 5 30 in
[28:08] the morning they brought me up and then
[28:11] after a while they
[28:13] sent me for mri in my head and i told
[28:15] that or something you're going to find
[28:17] nothing
[28:21] and then
[28:22] the doctor came back the next day
[28:25] and said to me that i had
[28:28] multiple strokes
[28:30] and he says he said and you're lucky
[28:33] you didn't lose none of your strength
[28:36] i didn't lose anything at all
[28:38] you know
[28:39] i'm sitting there in the bed with my
[28:41] legs crossed
[28:43] waiting to go home
[28:45] i just
[28:46] felt okay
[28:48] and then they had me on this
[28:51] blood thinners and this blood thinner is
[28:53] going to keep you there five to six days
[28:55] and the doctor says you know we could
[28:57] put you on uh eloquence and eloquence is
[29:00] real expensive and i said no problem
[29:04] i said the va will take care of it i
[29:07] didn't realize
[29:08] how expensive it is
[29:10] very expensive
[29:12] and uh
[29:14] and i want to thank you for your prayers

[29:26] sitting there like
[29:27] nothing happened

[29:38] what's wrong with that guy that's that's
[29:40] the way i
[29:41] i felt and actually that's the way i
[29:44] looked you know i just didn't look like
[29:46] anything was wrong but there's a lot of
[29:48] things wrong

[36:24] before the special offering we're going
[36:25] to lift that special offering we'll come
[36:28] and take it here in just a moment
[36:30] um
[36:31] some of you have already done that it's
[36:33] a little bit of a different process of
[36:34] what we've been here in the past months
[36:36] but if you as you drove up out here
[36:38] today
[36:50] a little bit more of a visual what's
[36:51] going to be taken out
[36:53] things are going to be changed
[36:55] one thing that
[36:57] will be done with this with this project
[36:59] is we will you can see by the markings
[37:02] will actually gain a little bit of
[37:04] rumor with the parking
[37:06] as far as the width part from here over
[37:09] to that edge so that's a good thing as
[37:11] well
[37:12] we're waiting
[37:14] the brothers have been
[37:16] working to try to get bids and for
[37:19] anybody who's a contractor i know
[37:20] there's some subcontractors here and i
[37:23] told them i said i remember how it was
[37:24] when we build our first house it's it's
[37:26] i had to track them down
[37:28] and uh you know they probably got tired
[37:30] of seeing me they could probably tell
[37:32] all about here comes that guy
[37:35] but you know they
[37:36] it's just i don't know it just seems to
[37:38] be one of those things trying to track
[37:40] down and get quotes in here and they're
[37:42] working uh in any way that we can to try
[37:45] to get all the different quotes that we
[37:47] can get
[37:48] on it and just trying to take the
[37:50] that approach as well
[37:52] um
[37:53] i'm going to ask the brothers if they'll
[37:55] go ahead at this time and
[37:57] make their way up and we'll just pray
[37:59] over a special offer we're about to take
[38:01] for this

[44:31] then go back and put batteries in the
[44:33] handheld by my desk if you don't mind
[44:35] brothers please
[44:37] genesis 22 11 and the angel of the lord
[44:41] called unto him out of heaven and said
[44:43] abram
[44:44] abraham
[44:46] and he said here
[44:48] am i. and he said
[44:51] lay not thine hand
[44:53] upon the lad neither do any anything
[44:57] unto him
[44:59] for i know
[45:00] for now i know that thou fearest god
[45:03] seeing that thou has not withheld thy
[45:05] son
[45:06] thine only son from me
[45:08] and abraham lifted up his eyes and
[45:10] looked and behold behind him a ram
[45:14] caught in a thicket by his horns and
[45:16] abraham went and took the ram and
[45:18] offered him up for a burnt offering in
[45:20] the stead
[45:22] of his son and abraham called the name
[45:25] of that place jehovah jireh as it had as
[45:28] it is said to this day in the mount of
[45:31] the lord it shall be seen
[45:34] and the angel of the lord called unto
[45:35] abraham out of heaven the second time
[45:39] and said by myself have i sworn saith
[45:42] the lord for because thou hast done this
[45:45] thing and has not withheld thine only
[45:48] son
[45:49] that in blessing i will bless thee and
[45:52] in multiplying i will multiply thy seed
[45:55] as the stars of the heaven
[45:58] and as the sand which is upon the
[45:59] seashore and thy seed shall possess
[46:04] the gate of his enemies
[46:07] and in thy seed shall all the nations of
[46:09] the earth be blessed because thou hast
[46:12] obeyed my voice so abraham returned unto
[46:16] his young men and they rose up and went
[46:18] together to beersheba and abraham dwelt
[46:22] at beersheba now if you'll just go to
[46:25] galatians chapter 3 and i'm just going
[46:27] to read a few verses of scripture from
[46:28] there and then we'll let you have your
[46:30] seats
[46:32] in galatians
[46:33] chapter 3 verse 27
[46:38] for as many as you
[46:40] as have been baptized into christ have
[46:43] put on christ
[46:45] there is neither jew nor greek
[46:47] neither is there bond nor free
[46:50] there is neither male nor female for
[46:53] you're all one in christ jesus
[46:56] and if you be christ then are you
[46:59] abraham's seed
[47:01] and heirs according to the promise
[47:05] amen may god bless you bless the reading
[47:07] of the word as you're being seated
[47:10] i want to just
[47:12] i want to just speak to you you didn't
[47:14] get this
[47:16] did you put batteries in here
[47:19] okay it's good okay thank you
[47:25] you have to really pray for me i don't
[47:27] like using handhelds
[47:31] i want to
[47:32] i want to speak continue on from
[47:36] thursday evening when we just
[47:38] just stepped aside and just looking at
[47:40] that thought
[47:44] but i want to deal with
[47:46] and speak in this manner unaltered
[47:49] and our
[47:50] response you know our response matters
[47:54] in every situation we're in
[47:57] i'd like to believe and i'd like to
[47:59] think
[48:00] that every time
[48:04] a challenge or a test
[48:07] it's working now okay it's all right
[48:09] i'll just leave this up here thank you
[48:12] god bless brother brian he runs so
[48:13] faithfully
[48:16] i probably need to buy him an ice cream
[48:18] sometimes
[48:21] he's
[48:21] constantly on it i love you amen i'm
[48:25] really happy now
[48:28] i'd love to believe that our response
[48:30] and we all would like we all
[48:32] struggle within ourselves so many times
[48:35] that we we we desire that our response
[48:39] would be a response
[48:41] that god himself would look down on and
[48:43] be able to say
[48:45] that's how i would have responded
[48:48] those are things that we we desire
[48:50] within our life
[48:52] and when we read about this here in
[48:53] genesis 22
[48:55] if this is the only account and only
[48:57] part of abraham's life that we had
[49:00] then we could look at that and say
[49:03] my goodness that's a that's a lofty
[49:05] expectation
[49:07] but you have to remember that in
[49:08] abraham's in this response where
[49:11] it's come to a place that god has asked
[49:13] abraham
[49:15] for
[49:16] every thing
[49:18] that has been given to him
[49:21] everything that abraham's life is
[49:24] wrapped up in and god has asked him for
[49:28] everything
[49:30] now when we look at this how abraham
[49:32] responds within this time we have a
[49:35] little bit of a window
[49:37] by the word of god to go into and see
[49:41] that there were times of adversity that
[49:44] abraham
[49:45] faced within his walk with god
[49:49] that his responses were not always
[49:51] responses that god could say that's how
[49:54] i would have responded
[49:56] as a matter of fact it shows you and i
[49:59] you know even even in the part brother
[50:02] brown remember him saying very honest
[50:04] with us in souls in prison now he says i
[50:07] often wondered
[50:09] about many of those things in the
[50:11] scriptures how abraham could do this how
[50:13] sarah could do this and brother branham
[50:15] just he wraps it up in this manner for
[50:18] you and i
[50:19] of while god is so impressed upon his
[50:21] heart that he said if not for those
[50:24] things you or i would not know the grace
[50:28] of god
[50:29] now we know the grace of god in his
[50:32] saving grace for our soul if you've
[50:34] really experienced that saving grace to
[50:36] know that it was not you or i nothing we
[50:39] could do to merit to earn or or or to
[50:43] bring ourselves up to a place to be
[50:45] acceptable it's it's it's laying
[50:47] everything in at the cross and saying
[50:50] lord i lay my life down i repent lord
[50:54] and my sins and i accept your pardon
[50:58] lord that grace lord to come into my
[51:01] life and bring a full liberation a
[51:04] reality of the pardon i'm asking for but
[51:08] then as we go on in our life we you and
[51:11] i are in need not that we're terrible
[51:14] people but we are in need of the grace
[51:16] of god in every aspect and every time of
[51:20] our life i won't ask you here this
[51:22] morning that how many of us maybe even
[51:24] this morning or throughout this week
[51:27] there's been responses that those
[51:29] responses would not be responses you'd
[51:31] be up here nor responses that god could
[51:34] say that's my boy that's my daughter
[51:37] as a matter of fact there's no doubt
[51:39] been responses that we have had to say
[51:41] lord forgive me i'm sorry but this is
[51:45] what i want you to see thank god there
[51:47] is a place not only to come back to
[51:51] but a place that you are tied to
[51:54] in jesus christ that is an absolute that
[51:58] is an anchor that when your response or
[52:01] my response is off the mark there is a
[52:04] god that can bring us right back in life
[52:07] and make no mistake about it there will
[52:09] never be a test to a born-again child of
[52:12] god that they will fail you might fail
[52:15] it now but you are going to pass it
[52:18] because god in you has already overcome
[52:22] everything
[52:23] amen you're not made out of cheap
[52:26] material you're not made out of things
[52:28] of silver and gold you're made out of
[52:30] the stuff that cannot be blocked
[52:34] you're made out of the substance of that
[52:36] life that came out of the bloody
[52:39] sacrifice of the blood of the lamb that
[52:42] same life that stood faithful
[52:47] hallelujah
[52:49] so responses they matter
[52:52] you say
[52:53] look at abraham's life and i want you
[52:55] just to listen very carefully now we can
[52:57] look at this but when we look at things
[53:00] in abraham's life there were things
[53:02] decisions that even abraham had made and
[53:05] brother bram tells us even going down to
[53:07] egypt that first time he said lot never
[53:11] overcame that exposure
[53:14] now abraham was was as as a seed of god
[53:18] and this is what i want to say that you
[53:20] and i know that there are things that we
[53:23] have confidence in the life of god the
[53:26] seed of god but as a child of god we
[53:29] don't want exposure with the enemy and
[53:31] we realize we can see as a child of god
[53:35] that genesis 22 is speaking of a mature
[53:39] son and daughter of god and here here is
[53:41] the whole theme of that maturity is of
[53:44] my own self i can do nothing but victory
[53:47] is submitting oneself to what god has
[53:50] said in the word and that's the greatest
[53:53] battle that's that's the greatest battle
[53:55] that battle still rages in the lives in
[53:58] our hearts even as the word requires
[54:01] things of us sometimes and our flesh and
[54:04] our spirit can pull against it i'm
[54:06] talking about even after you've been
[54:08] born again there's a constant war paul
[54:10] wrote of this in the book of galatians
[54:12] the spirit lusteth against the flesh the
[54:14] flesh lusteth against the spirit but you
[54:17] say which one's going to win depends on
[54:19] which one that you are giving
[54:21] preeminence to or feeding the most
[54:24] strong
[54:25] i don't know about you but i believe i
[54:27] can speak for all of us i don't want to
[54:29] repent for missing or have to just stay
[54:32] in a cycle of repentance i want to stay
[54:35] in a place to say god i want to live
[54:38] under the influence i'm put here to
[54:40] manifest the glory of god he didn't save
[54:43] me just to be saving me he saved me
[54:45] because there's a purpose and i am
[54:48] determined by the grace of god to see
[54:51] that purpose all the way through anybody
[54:53] with me this morning on that
[54:55] our response
[54:57] our response an unaltered response and
[55:00] this is where that we can see even as we
[55:03] look in genesis 22 you can see this
[55:06] parallel in abraham's life how the
[55:08] prophet would take it and begin to show
[55:11] that abraham's life was even that
[55:13] progression of the church ages how god
[55:17] would deal with a man in in restoring
[55:19] and building back there under luther and
[55:22] wesley and pentecost and coming to the
[55:24] ministry of the son of man there in
[55:27] genesis 18 everything the power the full
[55:30] power of god restored to the church of
[55:32] the living god all this is laid out in
[55:35] abraham's life there was a type that
[55:37] would bring the believer to a mature
[55:39] faith now if we have come to a place a
[55:42] mature faith or the prophet would word
[55:44] it a perfect faith then we recognize
[55:46] there must be a perfect word and there
[55:49] comes a test that is allotted for the
[55:52] hour that you and i are living in
[55:55] and give me just a little bit more i
[55:56] don't know where they went but i need a
[55:57] little bit more up here you see you i
[56:00] feel like i'm yelling in a 5 gallon
[56:01] bucket out there
[56:02] you see here's the test when we look at
[56:04] the test on different things you know
[56:07] remember when um the sons of of zebedee
[56:11] they they called out to jesus and or the
[56:13] mother said uh grant that one of my sons
[56:15] will sit on the right and one on the
[56:17] left and jesus told them and said that's
[56:19] not up to me to give that that's already
[56:22] been predetermined
[56:24] your position your bed of time the
[56:27] message that you would come under all of
[56:29] those things was predetermined in the
[56:32] mind of almighty god
[56:34] that's why a previous
[56:37] word a previous message in itself it
[56:40] could deal with your heart but your
[56:42] heart was intended to receive the full
[56:45] expression of god in this hour and
[56:48] that's why you and i are here in this
[56:51] place and as that mother requested that
[56:54] let one said on the left that once said
[56:56] on the right and what if jesus said that
[56:58] those who will follow me in the
[57:00] regeneration of the son of man or that
[57:02] of the new birth the true baptism of the
[57:05] holy ghost that that that is given unto
[57:08] them you know that test that was spoken
[57:11] of in that hour is a test that was
[57:13] promised for the bride of jesus christ
[57:16] in this hour because it is in this hour
[57:19] where christ himself will bring to
[57:21] himself the bride that he had in his
[57:24] mind before the foundation of the world
[57:26] and down through the ages has been
[57:29] making a word upon word upon word you
[57:32] see this is an hour where the bible said
[57:35] he that overcometh i will grant the set
[57:37] with him in my throne even as i overcame
[57:42] and have sat down with my father in his
[57:44] throne is that right
[57:46] so this is a time of a bride test a time
[57:50] of a full word test a time where the
[57:53] very test of the word will come in its
[57:56] strength and its fullness and its power
[57:59] let me tell you something there's a
[58:00] people upon this earth that are tied to
[58:04] that word that are anchored to that word
[58:06] and it's christ inside of the believer
[58:10] by a living experience that's able to
[58:12] reflect that we are the bride of jesus
[58:15] christ
[58:17] we're living in an hour it's an
[58:19] unaltered it's a time where god in this
[58:22] hour where man has altered the word
[58:26] all the way down through the ages
[58:27] remember
[58:28] when jesus came he talked to that group
[58:31] of religious people in that hour and he
[58:33] told them he said because of your
[58:36] alterations you have made the word of
[58:38] god of none effect
[58:42] he's only me said i don't care if you're
[58:43] quoting moses or whatever you're doing
[58:45] you have made it of none of fact
[58:48] god doesn't need his word altered to get
[58:52] people in
[58:54] come on now we're talking about sons and
[58:56] daughters of god who are of the same dna
[58:59] of the same genealogy they don't need to
[59:01] be babied and petted in and promised
[59:04] positions and and everything else but a
[59:07] real child of god will stand right there
[59:10] on the word you say brother samuel this
[59:12] one offended me or this offends me hey
[59:14] let me tell you something jesus stood
[59:16] there that day and said except you eat
[59:18] the flesh of the son of man and drink
[59:20] his blood you have no life in you it
[59:23] took a greater understanding because
[59:25] they could have stood there on the wall
[59:27] and challenged him
[59:29] are you with me leviticus on and on you
[59:32] shall not eat the blood of anything
[59:34] that's offered but it took an
[59:36] understanding and brother and sister it
[59:38] wasn't their intellects that understood
[59:41] it was the god who was present
[59:43] fulfilling his word in that hour and his
[59:46] children were upon earth and responding
[59:48] to that inspiration even when they
[59:51] didn't know
[59:53] what was going on they didn't know how
[59:55] to explain it but peter said i know this
[59:58] doubt that's the words of eternal life
[1:00:01] [Applause]
[1:00:03] hallelujah
[1:00:05] they had come and altered it you see
[1:00:07] when the word gets altered
[1:00:09] that's why brother branham said
[1:00:11] a false prophet produces false births
[1:00:14] is that right
[1:00:16] that's why brother brandon said when
[1:00:17] they rest and you know they rest upon
[1:00:20] we believe in emotion and all that i
[1:00:21] don't need to go through that you
[1:00:22] understand that
[1:00:24] but brother bryan said when you said you
[1:00:25] he said here they speak in tongues and
[1:00:27] they do this and they do that and he
[1:00:29] said and get out here and cut the hair
[1:00:31] and wear shorts and everything else that
[1:00:32] you can put that's ungodly he said and
[1:00:34] then you try to tell them they don't got
[1:00:36] the holy ghost why they're resting
[1:00:39] themselves upon the sensation
[1:00:44] the true holy ghost but it hadn't
[1:00:46] brought a real conversion on the inside
[1:00:50] when it brings a real let me tell you
[1:00:52] something real evidence of the holy
[1:00:53] ghost is there's no wavering on the word
[1:00:56] of almighty god
[1:00:59] it brings you in contact with the living
[1:01:02] god
[1:01:03] it brings you to a place that not just
[1:01:05] our lips but your life says amen to
[1:01:09] every word of god
[1:01:12] and if you can't say amen to every word
[1:01:14] of god you need the holy ghost i'm not
[1:01:17] saying that to put you down i'm telling
[1:01:19] you we're living in an hour that it's
[1:01:21] got to be alive that is able to
[1:01:23] recognize that it's a living christ
[1:01:26] who's in our midst that this word is not
[1:01:28] a man's word this is the word of
[1:01:31] almighty god and we must be tied and
[1:01:34] united with that word in a real
[1:01:36] experience with almighty god
[1:01:39] amen sister patsy good to see you
[1:01:42] preached here for i don't know how many
[1:01:43] minutes and i just
[1:01:44] god bless you
[1:01:46] notice this
[1:01:47] an unaltered this is our response
[1:01:51] we're living in a time
[1:01:54] in this hour
[1:01:56] as it talks about and i want to just
[1:01:57] kind of deal just for a few moments
[1:02:00] on the quality
[1:02:02] of this seed life the caliber of seed
[1:02:04] and we're talking about
[1:02:06] because
[1:02:08] we're living in an hour that is going to
[1:02:10] take more faith
[1:02:11] than it ever has and let me just say i'm
[1:02:13] not waiting on that faith to come it's
[1:02:14] here
[1:02:16] i'm not waiting on it to come
[1:02:17] i'm not waiting on the latter rain to
[1:02:19] come it's here
[1:02:21] man this is the final quickening unto
[1:02:23] the rapture
[1:02:24] come on now we we're not looking our way
[1:02:26] out and you got the church one oh we can
[1:02:28] just do this no we is to recognize our
[1:02:31] day and our visitation
[1:02:34] amen the quickening power of almighty
[1:02:36] god has come to the church of the living
[1:02:39] god it's not a man that can produce this
[1:02:41] kind of faith it takes god himself and
[1:02:44] when he gets among his children his
[1:02:46] children recognize him to be the same
[1:02:50] god they may not be able to explain
[1:02:52] everything they don't need to they
[1:02:54] recognize this is the living god and
[1:02:57] they want to be united with that god to
[1:02:59] where they can look in the face of death
[1:03:02] disease and whatever more and say god is
[1:03:05] still
[1:03:06] god
[1:03:07] [Music]
[1:03:13] in isaac remember israel in the natural
[1:03:17] failed
[1:03:19] they failed
[1:03:21] so this wasn't the natural seed of
[1:03:22] abraham
[1:03:24] come on now
[1:03:26] they crucified him
[1:03:28] they rejected him
[1:03:31] but this wasn't talking about the
[1:03:32] natural seed of isaac because it failed
[1:03:36] he was talking about that faith seed
[1:03:38] that royal seed that seed that would
[1:03:41] come straight from the loins of god's
[1:03:44] mind remember when abraham stood there
[1:03:46] abraham is testifying as a
[1:03:49] as a child of god and he says lord what
[1:03:52] will thou give me seeing that i'm
[1:03:54] childless and thou knowest one born in
[1:03:56] my house is heir shall this eleazar of
[1:03:58] damascus be the one and god speaks to
[1:04:01] him and lets him know you see what it is
[1:04:03] it's god's desire to express himself god
[1:04:07] took abraham's situation
[1:04:10] this situation was all laid out and
[1:04:13] through that situation where abraham is
[1:04:16] pouring out his heart he doesn't know
[1:04:18] that it's in tune with the heart and the
[1:04:21] mind of god that god's desire is to have
[1:04:24] an heir and god is not going to take a
[1:04:27] servant but he's going to have sons and
[1:04:30] the only way he can have sounds is its
[1:04:32] sounds that must come from his loins not
[1:04:36] the loins of a church not the loins of
[1:04:38] theology but from the loins of god
[1:04:42] himself where the holy ghost comes down
[1:04:45] and he makes that word alive on the
[1:04:47] inside and declares this is the son and
[1:04:50] daughter of god and god still remains
[1:04:53] god
[1:04:55] talking about an unaltered
[1:04:57] response
[1:04:59] this spiritual seed
[1:05:01] which is christ
[1:05:06] you see
[1:05:07] when we're looking at this and we're
[1:05:09] talking about this caliber this quality
[1:05:14] and looking where we're at in this hour
[1:05:17] in this time
[1:05:19] no wonder the scripture has it would
[1:05:20] read in the book of ephesians
[1:05:24] finally my brother
[1:05:27] put on the whole arm of god
[1:05:32] amen be clothed
[1:05:35] in the power
[1:05:36] of his might
[1:05:38] and having done all to stand
[1:05:41] stands
[1:05:44] sometimes you do all you know to do
[1:05:47] you pray
[1:05:49] right you take a problem you take the
[1:05:51] promise of god and it don't seem like
[1:05:53] nothing is moving
[1:05:56] but in the midst of that time is why
[1:05:57] it's important to have the foreigner of
[1:06:00] god
[1:06:01] and the form of god isn't something that
[1:06:02] you tack on the outside
[1:06:05] if you walk around
[1:06:06] and you tack it on like we do a bit no
[1:06:08] no no the full armor of god is what goes
[1:06:10] down on the inside
[1:06:13] it's the word of god on the inside
[1:06:16] the holy ghost inside of the individual
[1:06:18] the word
[1:06:19] inside of that life
[1:06:22] now think of this in this manner we
[1:06:24] we're looking at it here on thursday a
[1:06:26] little bit and i want to just just move
[1:06:28] back into a few of these places here
[1:06:30] just for a few moments and just to look
[1:06:33] here
[1:06:34] when you look at daniel as we were
[1:06:35] studying this here on thursday night and
[1:06:37] looking at it
[1:06:39] that daniel there was a trap that was
[1:06:41] set for him
[1:06:43] and daniel knew it was a trap
[1:06:48] these men could not find one flaw
[1:06:54] now i'm talking about even when it came
[1:06:56] to things of the kingdom they could not
[1:06:58] say you know what king you don't know
[1:07:01] daniel runs you down behind your back
[1:07:04] they couldn't find one thing
[1:07:06] but what they did say is there's no way
[1:07:09] that we're going to get this
[1:07:10] but we have got
[1:07:12] to trap him
[1:07:14] concerning the law of his god
[1:07:16] now they knew they knew enough about
[1:07:19] daniel's life a testimony he's not going
[1:07:22] to budge from the word
[1:07:24] i don't care what comes he's not going
[1:07:26] to deviate from it
[1:07:28] now remember i'm talking about the
[1:07:30] caliber and quality of seed life
[1:07:33] we're talking about maturity of the hour
[1:07:36] is that right sure they had all their
[1:07:38] weaknesses around them just like abraham
[1:07:40] had them throughout just like you and i
[1:07:42] are encompassed about with weakness but
[1:07:44] our focus is not upon the weakness we
[1:07:46] know we have them we know the struggles
[1:07:48] we have hey look in the life of the lord
[1:07:50] jesus when he came down to the end the
[1:07:52] bible said he feared in that he was
[1:07:56] heard with strong crying and tears
[1:07:59] asking if this be possible let this cut
[1:08:02] pass from me
[1:08:04] it wasn't that he wasn't a believer it
[1:08:06] wasn't that he wasn't the son of god the
[1:08:09] lamb of god it wasn't that at all but
[1:08:11] god listen to me now
[1:08:13] god was not a separate person
[1:08:16] god allowed himself to so merge into
[1:08:19] humanity so that god himself could know
[1:08:23] you and i and have kinship as
[1:08:25] brotherhood he allowed himself not he
[1:08:28] was made he allowed himself to
[1:08:32] condescend in such a way to feel what
[1:08:35] it's like
[1:08:38] to learn
[1:08:40] the cost
[1:08:41] of obedience
[1:08:43] the cost of obedience to the word our
[1:08:44] heart
[1:08:45] says amen to the word of god
[1:08:48] but there are challenging times
[1:08:50] that comes about but that this is where
[1:08:53] the inside man must be greater it must
[1:08:57] be the man that god himself has placed
[1:09:00] there himself on the inside of that life
[1:09:02] that gives us strength to prevail in the
[1:09:06] midst of that time
[1:09:09] so here's daniel you know a trap is set
[1:09:13] for him
[1:09:14] now daniel knows this trap is set
[1:09:17] brother bran tells us he walks humbly in
[1:09:19] this moment
[1:09:20] this is the seed of abraham
[1:09:23] now when they made this they made this
[1:09:25] stand
[1:09:26] remember in that time
[1:09:28] daniel
[1:09:29] he goes right to his house in daniel 6
[1:09:31] 10 if i could just read that
[1:09:33] when daniel knew that the writing was
[1:09:35] signed
[1:09:36] he went into his house
[1:09:38] now that was something new
[1:09:41] this is what daniel did
[1:09:44] and his windows being opened in his
[1:09:46] chamber toward jerusalem i want you to
[1:09:48] catch this he had his windows open
[1:09:51] toward jerusalem
[1:09:56] i feel like preaching right now
[1:09:58] it's important to have
[1:10:00] yourself open toward the world
[1:10:05] it's important that your life is pointed
[1:10:08] toward the word that god has vindicated
[1:10:12] toward the living god you see daniel
[1:10:14] knew
[1:10:15] that sacrifice was laying in jerusalem
[1:10:17] because remember daniel was one of the
[1:10:19] children of captivity that preceded the
[1:10:22] whole conclusive captivity daniel was
[1:10:25] already down there in babylon daniel
[1:10:28] knew this though in going down there
[1:10:30] into babylon and daniel his life daniel
[1:10:33] said i don't care if i'm going to
[1:10:35] babylon i don't want to go to babylon
[1:10:37] but i'm going there but it ain't going
[1:10:39] to change my worship
[1:10:41] amen
[1:10:42] if there's somewhere you go that changes
[1:10:45] your worship then maybe you are not go
[1:10:50] are you with me
[1:10:51] if you're going somewhere and it wants
[1:10:53] to alter your worship alter your life
[1:10:56] then you better not go
[1:10:59] because if you can't go anywhere and
[1:11:01] take jesus then don't go
[1:11:03] if jesus ain't welcome i ain't welcome
[1:11:06] [Music]
[1:11:08] is that right
[1:11:09] amen let everyone that nameth the name
[1:11:11] of christ depart from iniquity and all
[1:11:13] we do in word ordeal let it all be done
[1:11:16] in the name of jesus christ he had his
[1:11:18] windows
[1:11:20] open
[1:11:21] toward jerusalem
[1:11:24] well no doubt he had some screens in
[1:11:25] those windows too
[1:11:28] are you with me because you can't be
[1:11:30] letting just any kind of bugs get in
[1:11:32] your spirit
[1:11:34] come on you can't let any kind of bugs
[1:11:36] get in that affection gates of memory
[1:11:38] and reason and everything come on now
[1:11:39] you know how it is if you got your
[1:11:41] windows up in the summertime or whatever
[1:11:43] more and all of a sudden hear these
[1:11:44] ladybugs and you know bees and
[1:11:46] everything what do you start looking for
[1:11:47] you start looking is there a tear on the
[1:11:49] screen is there something or wrong along
[1:11:50] the edge why the screen is there so you
[1:11:53] can enjoy the air coming in but keep out
[1:11:56] the things you don't want this is why in
[1:11:59] our life our life is to be kept covered
[1:12:02] by the blood of jesus christ we want our
[1:12:05] responses to be word responses and god
[1:12:08] has given you and i an obligation keep
[1:12:11] the screen fortified in your windows
[1:12:14] there's things sometimes yes that we
[1:12:16] have to go out we have to do we have to
[1:12:19] walk out here in satan's evening among
[1:12:21] the world but let us have the screen of
[1:12:24] the baptism of the holy ghost that's on
[1:12:26] our soul let that be the filter of the
[1:12:29] word that leader when something comes we
[1:12:32] either accept it or reject it amen
[1:12:38] glory be to god
[1:12:40] amen
[1:12:42] oh he kneeled upon his knees three times
[1:12:45] a day
[1:12:46] and prayed and gave thanks before his
[1:12:48] god
[1:12:48] as he did a four time
[1:12:52] so before the statue came
[1:12:54] daniel
[1:13:01] and you could have went in silent mode
[1:13:05] he wasn't doing this
[1:13:07] you know what i'm going to show them
[1:13:08] they can't do no that's what he was
[1:13:09] doing
[1:13:11] come on friends you know that's wrong
[1:13:14] there might be things you disagree with
[1:13:15] or whatever more but let me tell you
[1:13:17] even if what you disagree with is the
[1:13:19] right thing to disagree with if your
[1:13:20] motive and objective is wrong
[1:13:23] god sees that
[1:13:28] is that right if the motive and
[1:13:29] objective is wrong it's the same thing
[1:13:30] as not being the will of god
[1:13:33] but daniel had an excellent spirit
[1:13:35] the bible said daniel was a man of
[1:13:37] understanding when you study the
[1:13:41] man that is able
[1:13:43] wisdom knows when to hold his mouth
[1:13:45] knows when to say what he's able to be
[1:13:47] instructed and god had instructed him in
[1:13:51] a manner continue on daniel continued on
[1:13:53] daniel he had no wisdom this was a
[1:13:56] response that you see daniel was being
[1:13:58] tested you say how was daniel being
[1:14:00] tested now remember we looked at this a
[1:14:02] little bit on thursday night because you
[1:14:05] know many times when people say well
[1:14:06] i've got a hard trial well what's your
[1:14:08] trial well i lost my job well well the
[1:14:10] bootlegger out there can lose his job
[1:14:12] we're not making light of that you
[1:14:14] understand
[1:14:15] but we're talking about tests we're
[1:14:16] talking about tests on the work
[1:14:20] are you with me
[1:14:21] when when things come along because not
[1:14:24] only does this the here among us cancer
[1:14:27] can come in and have and god's brought
[1:14:29] deliverance is that right but cancer hit
[1:14:31] somebody out there
[1:14:33] god you know god never said well i'll
[1:14:35] keep cancer away from you he never said
[1:14:38] that in his word
[1:14:39] is that right
[1:14:41] but even the prophet in this hour never
[1:14:43] looked for that but god made his promise
[1:14:46] so real of what he promised back there
[1:14:49] that god said when it comes i will lift
[1:14:52] it from your life
[1:14:54] in other words it will not have power
[1:14:57] over you but you will have power over it
[1:15:02] is that right
[1:15:04] conditions and circumstances and things
[1:15:07] that come around understand that it's
[1:15:09] always an objective satan wants to try
[1:15:12] to take a time of a test and try to gain
[1:15:15] power over us
[1:15:18] but the test didn't come from the devil
[1:15:21] are you hearing me
[1:15:22] he don't have no say in it
[1:15:26] you say well brother samuel what about
[1:15:27] it when he came when he came to god
[1:15:29] concerning job
[1:15:33] god already
[1:15:36] knew let me tell you something god
[1:15:39] already knew the outcome of it
[1:15:41] that's why god could stand there and
[1:15:43] when he was talking about people god
[1:15:45] said let me tell you i got one of my
[1:15:47] boys down there that have you considered
[1:15:50] my servant job
[1:15:54] he didn't go talk to god about job god
[1:15:56] said here i got one for you have you
[1:15:59] seen him have you considered him
[1:16:03] you know what's happened god was having
[1:16:05] a testimony service there
[1:16:07] the devil he said shut up a minute have
[1:16:09] you considered him
[1:16:11] [Music]
[1:16:14] amen he has lot faithful with me
[1:16:16] no matter what has come his way even
[1:16:18] when his children were going a certain
[1:16:20] way look at him there offering that
[1:16:22] sacrifice over and over and over and
[1:16:25] over what's he standing on he's standing
[1:16:28] on my word have you considered him
[1:16:32] oh brother santa i want that kind of
[1:16:34] testimony are you sure
[1:16:36] because when god goes to testifying like
[1:16:38] that
[1:16:43] but after all we're talking about the
[1:16:44] patience
[1:16:46] of job the endurance
[1:16:48] of job
[1:16:50] is that right we're talking about not
[1:16:52] the dna of job
[1:16:54] not the dna of abraham not the dna of
[1:16:56] daniel not the dna of the hebrew
[1:16:59] children don't ever get your eyes on the
[1:17:00] dna of a man
[1:17:03] because the dna of a man will fail you
[1:17:07] come on now your own dna will fail you
[1:17:10] your own times in your own life that you
[1:17:12] say my goodness how could i have
[1:17:15] made this mistake my goodness this trap
[1:17:17] has come up your own your own dna you
[1:17:20] know you can't have confidence even in
[1:17:22] your own flesh it's because our only
[1:17:25] source of confidence and trust and hope
[1:17:28] is in the lord
[1:17:30] and that's why you must be born again to
[1:17:34] have an anchor in the god who cannot
[1:17:37] fail
[1:17:38] in a god who's there to move you and
[1:17:41] direct you that though you might fail
[1:17:44] but you're tied to an anchor and the
[1:17:46] same anger you're tied to will bring you
[1:17:49] and mature you to where when you face
[1:17:51] that test again you'll stand there as a
[1:17:53] son and daughter of god that's been
[1:17:55] under the maturing rays of the yes so
[1:17:58] here and be able to recognize the devil
[1:18:01] at his trip and say papa i need your
[1:18:04] strength right now
[1:18:05] [Applause]
[1:18:07] i'm talking about an altar
[1:18:10] our response
[1:18:15] hallelujah when the hebrew children
[1:18:18] they were down there you see all of this
[1:18:20] right here
[1:18:21] in the book of daniel
[1:18:23] and you know
[1:18:24] the book of daniel's a wonderful book
[1:18:27] my goodness how it unfolds everything
[1:18:30] regarding the god the visitation
[1:18:32] you know of the jews and that part into
[1:18:34] the gentiles the gentile image
[1:18:37] but remember
[1:18:39] every one of these
[1:18:41] great mysteries
[1:18:42] came also with battles
[1:18:46] and it was also with a lot of prayer
[1:18:49] and fasting
[1:18:51] somehow or another we've gotten away
[1:18:52] from that
[1:18:57] you know what you know the reason prayer
[1:18:59] is attacked is because we're in we're so
[1:19:02] used to instant gratification
[1:19:05] i need an answer
[1:19:07] answer
[1:19:08] i need an answer just talk on talk to dr
[1:19:11] google
[1:19:13] how do i fix the microwave
[1:19:16] but sometimes prayer you don't get an
[1:19:18] instant answer
[1:19:19] sometimes in prayer you've got to wake
[1:19:21] but it is not for nothing amen you're
[1:19:24] saying i'm praying that i ain't getting
[1:19:26] no answer stand there and knock and
[1:19:28] knock and knock and knock him out why am
[1:19:30] i knocking you're not knocking because
[1:19:32] you don't believe you're nothing because
[1:19:34] you're saying he's the one that has the
[1:19:36] answer i'm his son he's my papa and he
[1:19:39] will not give me a stove instead of a
[1:19:41] piece of bread
[1:19:43] he's a revelation to know who we're in
[1:19:46] the midst of it's a living god he's
[1:19:48] heard your prayer
[1:19:52] hallelujah
[1:19:54] an unaltered response what are you doing
[1:19:56] today it looked like your prayers ain't
[1:19:58] getting nowhere you've been praying for
[1:20:00] this praying for that i'm going to pray
[1:20:01] again
[1:20:04] matter of fact my windows are open
[1:20:06] toward heaven
[1:20:09] why you ain't had no rain come down from
[1:20:11] heaven but i'm got them open because
[1:20:13] rain's on the way
[1:20:15] just because the weather forecast hasn't
[1:20:18] said rain is coming it's already
[1:20:21] witnessed in my heart rains on the way
[1:20:24] so open up the windows amen open up the
[1:20:28] windows because the blessings of heaven
[1:20:31] belong to me as a child of god
[1:20:35] [Applause]
[1:20:38] amen i tell you daniel what you're doing
[1:20:40] you're doing the same thing you've done
[1:20:41] before
[1:20:43] done a four time
[1:20:46] oh glory be to god
[1:20:48] you see
[1:20:50] there was also some hebrew children
[1:20:52] here they were
[1:20:56] you know
[1:20:58] god had already revealed
[1:21:00] about this image
[1:21:02] this
[1:21:03] image that would
[1:21:05] come forth that was given there to
[1:21:07] nebuchadnezzar in a dream god unfolds it
[1:21:09] there to daniel and we see that those
[1:21:11] gentile world powers as it comes all the
[1:21:15] way down even to the hour we're living
[1:21:16] in where the iron and clay in the toes
[1:21:20] is that right
[1:21:22] god have a prophet on earth to identify
[1:21:24] we're living in the toes and the two big
[1:21:26] toes we're setting the new you in at
[1:21:27] that time
[1:21:28] is that right right
[1:21:31] khrushchev and eisenhower the two big
[1:21:33] toes
[1:21:34] it's at the end
[1:21:36] is that right
[1:21:38] gentile world powers but remember that
[1:21:40] image was the image of a holy man
[1:21:44] see satan's ride in taking over is a
[1:21:48] ride that comes through religious realm
[1:21:53] it's a religious ride is that right
[1:21:55] started out the white horse rider
[1:21:57] innocency begins to ride in innocency to
[1:22:00] want to try to take power from the
[1:22:02] church and he has to come in and do it
[1:22:04] by flatteries
[1:22:06] promise feel good things i don't want to
[1:22:08] feel good things
[1:22:09] my flesh wants to feel good things i'll
[1:22:10] just be honest with you yours does too
[1:22:14] but there's something in my soul that
[1:22:16] says i gotta have something more than i
[1:22:18] feel good when i'm going through the
[1:22:20] tests and the trial i've got to have god
[1:22:23] with skin on it i've got to have
[1:22:25] strength in my life that in the middle
[1:22:27] of that time there's a greater something
[1:22:30] on the inside than my horn
[1:22:37] here they were
[1:22:40] in daniel 3.
[1:23:11] god has not done this as gold that i'm
[1:23:12] more than anything than anybody else it
[1:23:15] is god's mercy
[1:23:18] is that right
[1:23:19] oh my i'll tell you what lessons we
[1:23:21] could learn right there when daniel when
[1:23:23] they were ready to kill all of them and
[1:23:24] daniel said
[1:23:26] stop being so flighty
[1:23:29] come on now daniel said hey you know
[1:23:31] what go tell the king quit being so
[1:23:32] hasty
[1:23:35] we can learn a little bit right there
[1:23:36] what got to happen right now oh my
[1:23:37] goodness oh my goodness i gotta have a
[1:23:39] decision right now oh my goodness oh my
[1:23:40] goodness oh my goodness oh my goodness

[1:23:46] god don't work that way
[1:23:48] amen
[1:23:49] you're made as a channel of god and god
[1:23:52] cannot work through channels that are
[1:23:54] all twisted up and anxious as the bible
[1:23:56] says be still and know that i am god
[1:24:00] stand still and see the salvation of the
[1:24:03] lord
[1:24:04] amen if you're all twisted up we've all
[1:24:06] been there
[1:24:08] come on now maybe you were there this
[1:24:10] morning maybe that you were there
[1:24:11] yesterday hey don't let the devil beat
[1:24:13] you up about that just recognize that
[1:24:15] you can say god i'm asking right now as
[1:24:18] the son and daughter of god i take
[1:24:19] dominion over this temple
[1:24:22] amen come on now speak to that storm
[1:24:26] speak to that opposition amen
[1:24:29] hallelujah you're a son and daughter of
[1:24:31] god it has to obey your voice because
[1:24:33] your voice is veiling the authority of
[1:24:35] almighty god
[1:24:38] here was daniel
[1:24:40] the hebrew children in that time
[1:24:42] it was an image of a holy man brother
[1:24:44] bram tells us it was the image of daniel
[1:24:47] right right
[1:24:49] they wanted them all to bow to daniel
[1:24:52] holy man
[1:24:53] my brother brown ties that out you know
[1:24:54] the pope and goes on and on and on and
[1:24:56] on but we recognize it that we don't bow
[1:24:59] to the image
[1:25:00] of no man
[1:25:03] now i know some people take that so far
[1:25:05] and they'll use that to if they don't
[1:25:06] want to follow this or follow this
[1:25:08] they'll but i'm talking about to the
[1:25:10] child of god because we're not going by
[1:25:12] man anyhow
[1:25:15] come on now we've got to be in tune with
[1:25:17] the holy ghost
[1:25:19] the bible said to discern the body of
[1:25:21] jesus christ to discern the body is to
[1:25:24] discern the holy ghost that's working in
[1:25:26] our midst and working through the body
[1:25:28] of jesus christ according to his word
[1:25:31] is that right yes sir notice here they
[1:25:34] were in that time
[1:25:37] what are you going to do
[1:25:39] they called them up there you know these
[1:25:41] we we know these things right we know
[1:25:43] them
[1:25:44] but this is a time of application where
[1:25:46] we're at right now
[1:25:48] you see because what they're being
[1:25:50] tested on is the word
[1:25:54] that's what we're saying before testing
[1:25:55] is on the word
[1:25:57] daniel was being tested brother brown
[1:25:59] tells us like this i read it to you on
[1:26:01] thursday he was being tested if he would
[1:26:03] stand on the word that god has spoke
[1:26:06] through solomon if thy people be in
[1:26:08] trouble in any place and you know the
[1:26:10] rest of the story but they will look
[1:26:12] toward thy holy temple i will hear from
[1:26:14] heaven
[1:26:15] come on now
[1:26:17] he was being tested on that word how
[1:26:19] many how many how many have been tested
[1:26:21] on word and have forsaken the word
[1:26:24] because of emotions
[1:26:26] because of flesh
[1:26:29] come on now
[1:26:31] how many
[1:26:32] in the days right here when the three
[1:26:34] hebrew children were tested let me tell
[1:26:36] you something everybody who went and
[1:26:38] worshiped and fell down before that
[1:26:40] image they were not all heavens
[1:26:43] there was many jews millions of them
[1:26:46] brother ram tells us this was a church
[1:26:49] in that day made up of four
[1:26:52] daniel and the three who brewed children
[1:26:56] don't get worried and scared about that
[1:26:58] you to know whom you have believed and
[1:27:00] persuaded that he is able to keep you
[1:27:05] amen you recognize the living god
[1:27:08] recognize who is in your midst your
[1:27:10] trust is not in the arm of flesh your
[1:27:13] trust is not here so man your trust is
[1:27:16] in the word of god because if you get
[1:27:18] your eyes on a man i don't care who it
[1:27:20] is if that man believes the word then
[1:27:22] you leave that man
[1:27:25] even if it's me you lead that man if he
[1:27:27] leaves the word amen because this word
[1:27:31] is everything this word is jesus christ
[1:27:36] [Music]
[1:27:38] hallelujah
[1:27:40] we don't know about personalities or how
[1:27:42] long it is or how long that we stay with
[1:27:45] the word of god
[1:27:47] to hear the voice of almighty god
[1:27:50] speaking to us personally
[1:27:56] how are you boys
[1:27:57] when the music's being played i would've
[1:27:59] heard you

[1:28:04] yeah yeah
[1:28:06] yeah okay
[1:28:08] you've heard right
[1:28:10] yep you've heard right so these guys
[1:28:12] weren't out there with picket signs
[1:28:15] they weren't under that anointing
[1:28:18] come on now they knew that kingdoms days
[1:28:21] were numbered
[1:28:25] but they were part of another kingdom
[1:28:30] and in that kingdom its days are no him
[1:28:34] [Applause]
[1:28:35] you see what kingdom are you going to
[1:28:37] give your strength to
[1:28:40] amen what kingdom do you want to see
[1:28:42] build up in your life the kingdom of
[1:28:44] this world
[1:28:45] the kingdom of whatever your last name
[1:28:47] is or the kingdom of god
[1:28:50] i want to see the kingdom of god build
[1:28:51] up in my life and then what you want to
[1:28:53] see i want to see that pyramid build up
[1:28:56] in my life
[1:28:58] jesus christ reflected that tabernacle
[1:29:00] of god where the virtues are pouring out
[1:29:03] in our lives
[1:29:06] i hear you guys ain't worshiping
[1:29:08] no no we're worshipping or you are
[1:29:11] yeah but witness not
[1:29:12] we're not worshipping
[1:29:15] according
[1:29:17] to these dictates
[1:29:20] we're worshiping
[1:29:21] according to the word
[1:29:23] which was before the dictates
[1:29:30] the king got angry he had an anointing
[1:29:32] on him
[1:29:34] he had an anointing on him he got angry
[1:29:37] and he told them
[1:29:38] are you gonna think about it shadrach
[1:29:40] meshach and abednego i don't believe
[1:29:41] they were bodybuilders
[1:29:44] i don't believe that
[1:29:45] i don't even believe that looks like
[1:29:46] some of the people they got muscles here
[1:29:50] hey if the count if the qualification is
[1:29:52] right brother bram tells us that jesus
[1:29:54] was a spindly looking fellow
[1:29:56] bible said no beauty we should desire
[1:29:58] him
[1:29:59] because it wasn't an earthly power
[1:30:01] that's right
[1:30:03] it was heavenly power
[1:30:06] so
[1:30:07] you know
[1:30:09] they call the strongest men in there to
[1:30:11] bind them
[1:30:13] why do you need the strongest guys to
[1:30:14] bind them
[1:30:15] you know god's making a testimony
[1:30:20] they told the king they said we don't
[1:30:21] have to think about this
[1:30:23] we're not bound
[1:30:26] we are going to stand
[1:30:28] on the word of god
[1:30:31] he's able to deliver us
[1:30:33] whether he will or not
[1:30:35] we're going to be delivered either way
[1:30:38] you know what they were testifying no
[1:30:40] matter the circumstance i got joy in my
[1:30:44] soul
[1:30:45] god is in control come on now they have
[1:30:48] victory
[1:30:50] come on church
[1:30:52] you can't wait when i get out of fire
[1:30:54] glory to god i'm gonna have victory have
[1:30:56] victory while you're facing the fire
[1:30:57] have victory while you're in the fire
[1:30:59] how can i do that cause you've got the
[1:31:01] victory of the holy ghost
[1:31:04] on the inside of your life
[1:31:07] who have you been fellowshipping with
[1:31:11] come on church
[1:31:12] you can't fellowship with the things of
[1:31:14] the world well i know this good bible
[1:31:17] program i know this you can't fellowship
[1:31:19] with the things of god or the things of
[1:31:22] the world you've got a fellowship with
[1:31:24] the things of almighty god
[1:31:27] how can you turn to those things out
[1:31:29] there and you claim to be born again of
[1:31:31] the spirit of god i'm not doubting that
[1:31:34] you are but if you are you know your
[1:31:36] source of strength and you will feed on
[1:31:39] the unfailing word of almighty god
[1:31:45] brother samuel i can't seem to listen to
[1:31:46] a tape right now i rebuke that line
[1:31:49] devil in the name of jesus christ
[1:31:53] he's a liar
[1:31:55] you put it on and you watch an
[1:31:56] atmosphere change
[1:31:59] cold church
[1:32:00] we're not walking by reasoning
[1:32:03] we're walking by dust saith the lord
[1:32:07] what is our response
[1:32:10] unaltered
[1:32:22] my time
[1:32:28] what are you doing trying to catch my
[1:32:29] breath
[1:32:32] here they stood those three hebrew
[1:32:33] children
[1:32:40] you know brother branham i love how he
[1:32:42] breaks in and dramatized that brother
[1:32:43] dave i love it
[1:32:45] he said what their testimony was they
[1:32:47] broke in and said you know what
[1:32:50] we had a test we had a prayer meeting
[1:32:52] last night
[1:32:55] no they didn't get on facebook and see
[1:32:56] who could sympathize with them
[1:32:58] preach brother samuel your strength is
[1:33:01] not in facebook
[1:33:04] oh i i i'm listening to dr so-and-so
[1:33:06] what about dr jesus
[1:33:09] what about jesus
[1:33:11] if he was good enough to clean you up
[1:33:13] and save your soul and fill you with the
[1:33:15] holy ghost he ought to be good enough in
[1:33:18] every heart time in every situation that
[1:33:20] comes your way i'm telling you he's a
[1:33:22] friend that's sticking closer to my
[1:33:24] brother
[1:33:26] our response unaltered
[1:33:33] here they walked in there they bound
[1:33:35] them you know sometimes we wonder why
[1:33:38] things come our way
[1:33:40] we do
[1:33:41] look at the hebrew children oh they must
[1:33:43] have been doing something wrong no
[1:33:46] sometimes as it was with a man who was
[1:33:48] born
[1:33:48] blind that thinking was there among the
[1:33:51] disciples what did this guy do what did
[1:33:52] his parents do because they know
[1:33:54] in his diseases and sickness can be
[1:33:56] passed down and they knew that
[1:33:58] but jesus said no no no
[1:34:00] this was not because anybody sinned
[1:34:03] this was because of an opportunity
[1:34:06] for the word of god to be made manifest
[1:34:11] and god had the strongest men to bind
[1:34:13] them and the strongest men the strongest
[1:34:16] soldiers was going to take them there it
[1:34:18] speaks of the hour we're living in
[1:34:20] brother branham would tell us in the
[1:34:21] message contest satan he said is getting
[1:34:23] more powerful and more powerful and more
[1:34:26] powerful and more powerful
[1:34:29] come on it ain't bragging on the devil
[1:34:31] we ain't taking no hold he don't have no
[1:34:32] muscle power no no he's more powerful
[1:34:36] but this is god's answer in this hour
[1:34:39] i'm the unaltered god my dynamic power
[1:34:43] is still the same i don't got to change
[1:34:46] one word
[1:34:50] hallelujah just let me get inside of my
[1:34:54] children i'll defeat every devil
[1:34:56] i'll take their flesh i'll take their
[1:34:58] life i'll overcome i'll stand in the
[1:35:01] middle of their life all you see is
[1:35:02] flesh standing there but in the middle
[1:35:04] there's a hidden man that is standing
[1:35:07] there with a foot upon the land and a
[1:35:09] foot upon the sea they've got the
[1:35:10] authority of this world in their life
[1:35:14] amen they receive of the holy ghost
[1:35:18] brother the holy ghost ain't a sensation
[1:35:21] it ain't a feeling you might have that
[1:35:23] and that's all good and fine i love
[1:35:25] emotions i love to feel it but i'm
[1:35:28] talking about standing there when the
[1:35:30] world is breaking away all around you
[1:35:33] and you've got something in the midst of
[1:35:35] that time that's able to say i don't
[1:35:38] know how i'm gonna make it but i know
[1:35:41] that god
[1:35:42] is able
[1:35:44] [Music]
[1:35:44] [Applause]
[1:35:46] [Music]
[1:35:48] we need supermen and women we got a
[1:35:50] super god
[1:35:51] a supernatural one that's giving us a
[1:35:54] super sin
[1:35:59] hello
[1:36:02] sometimes you gotta press a little bit
[1:36:05] is that right
[1:36:07] sometimes you gotta press a little bit
[1:36:10] we're tested
[1:36:11] right what's our response going to be
[1:36:15] there's times even in standing right
[1:36:16] here i don't feel like standing here
[1:36:19] sometimes it's tiny i got pain all the
[1:36:21] way down my side i don't feel like
[1:36:22] standing here time standing and sitting
[1:36:25] in the office and everything else i'm
[1:36:26] not taking away from that but i say this
[1:36:29] to you not to put anybody down come on
[1:36:31] you know enough
[1:36:32] but it's to say sometimes we're tested
[1:36:34] things aren't always
[1:36:36] easy but what will our response be
[1:36:41] how can we stand in the face of those of
[1:36:44] hebrews 11 and the face of those down
[1:36:46] through time and they stand there where
[1:36:48] some of them they were ripped to pieces
[1:36:52] come on brother timothy preached that
[1:36:54] last week you had others that boy we all
[1:36:56] would have signed up for that whole
[1:36:58] walls come down and everything else but
[1:37:00] how many would have stood up and said
[1:37:01] well hey you know i'm going to be a
[1:37:03] daniel oh my yeah i'll be a daniel
[1:37:06] delivered from the lions but how many
[1:37:08] would have said yeah i'll be those who
[1:37:10] delivered from the lions but it wasn't
[1:37:11] like daniel
[1:37:13] was eaten
[1:37:17] but god's word didn't fail
[1:37:20] sometimes when it seems like something
[1:37:22] is overtaking you a sickness or a
[1:37:24] disease brother samuel i've been
[1:37:26] addressing the things don't stop
[1:37:27] addressing it
[1:37:30] keep drawing strength from el shaddai
[1:37:33] and stand there toe to toe because you
[1:37:35] know as a believer that god's word can't
[1:37:38] fail and god is the word
[1:37:44] so what are you boys going to do well
[1:37:47] so here they throw them in there
[1:37:50] but after they got in there
[1:37:52] think about it the guys who threw them
[1:37:53] in brother and them guys got burned up
[1:37:58] you know why
[1:37:59] amen glory they weren't built to face
[1:38:03] the fire
[1:38:06] well i feel like i felt like doing a
[1:38:07] little praise break
[1:38:09] you know why that's why brother brandon
[1:38:11] said boy about about got beside myself
[1:38:13] on thursday before i got out here
[1:38:15] brother brown said how do you fight fire
[1:38:17] you fight fire with fire
[1:38:19] and the way you fight fire with fire is
[1:38:21] called backfiring you see the oncoming
[1:38:23] fire and you go ahead and put fire right
[1:38:25] here and you consume every bit of
[1:38:27] material that could possibly catch on
[1:38:30] fire that's why the baptism of the holy
[1:38:32] ghost is the living power of almighty
[1:38:35] god it consumes the world it consumes
[1:38:37] the desires out of your life and it
[1:38:40] makes you a place that though the fire
[1:38:42] encroaches brother it's a living fire on
[1:38:45] the inside that'll fight that fire
[1:38:49] greater is he that is in me
[1:38:54] unaltered that's our response
[1:38:57] [Music]
[1:39:08] he sees a fourth man in there brother
[1:39:09] brian
[1:39:11] if they had never went into that fire
[1:39:13] they'd have never had that kind of
[1:39:14] testimony
[1:39:16] they came out of that fire they had a
[1:39:17] new experience
[1:39:20] you see to believers it's not looking at
[1:39:22] tests even though in our flesh come on
[1:39:23] now our test boy can you know oh man oh
[1:39:27] lord oh my goodness all right our flesh
[1:39:30] come on now the flesh is weak
[1:39:33] but the inside mind that strength on the
[1:39:36] inside that it can maybe only words you
[1:39:38] can crawl out at that time is lord
[1:39:40] i need help
[1:39:42] lord i'm discouraged
[1:39:45] lord i need strength right now
[1:39:47] i need encouragement lord and god
[1:39:50] right here i am
[1:39:52] here i am right right right here i am
[1:39:55] right here i am
[1:39:56] it was a fresh experience and when they
[1:39:59] came out of there
[1:40:00] you know they came out of there
[1:40:03] that didn't even look like they had been
[1:40:05] in the fire
[1:40:08] you know how it is we get close to the
[1:40:10] grill sometimes this gets burnt
[1:40:13] these hairs get burnt
[1:40:14] is that right
[1:40:16] they came out of there and you
[1:40:25] man y'all don't even smell like you've
[1:40:26] been through a test
[1:40:31] it wasn't that they had some super close
[1:40:36] come on they didn't have space suits
[1:40:37] from nasa
[1:40:40] they had a god on the inside
[1:40:43] the james god on the inside is the same
[1:40:46] god that knew him from their mother's
[1:40:48] womb the same god that brought adam on
[1:40:50] top of an animal on top of adam it's the
[1:40:52] same god who was there that held them in
[1:40:54] that hour and the fire itself had no
[1:40:57] power over them but they had power over
[1:41:00] the fire
[1:41:03] you ever think about this god never came
[1:41:05] down and put the fire out
[1:41:07] oh god put the fire out oh god put the
[1:41:09] fire out oh god come on now and our
[1:41:12] flesh we'd have been praying that
[1:41:13] wonder haven't had shadrach meshach and
[1:41:15] abednego
[1:41:18] in my rain
[1:41:19] right
[1:41:21] oh man i'll tell you if it rains
[1:41:23] oh my there might have been one rain
[1:41:25] but see god didn't do away with the fire
[1:41:30] sometimes the very things we're praying
[1:41:32] for oh god get rid of this oh god get
[1:41:34] rid of that god get rid of it and god's
[1:41:35] giving a test whether we're going to
[1:41:37] stand on his word
[1:41:39] amen
[1:41:40] well brother samuel if i felt better
[1:41:42] brother samuel if i had more victory in
[1:41:43] my
[1:41:44] life let's just put it like this say god
[1:41:48] i'm not going to give you no more
[1:41:49] excuses amen
[1:41:51] because what it really is is i need more
[1:41:53] of you
[1:41:56] if you already have a living power a
[1:41:58] living portion on the inside where your
[1:42:00] life has been saying don't get don't
[1:42:02] don't be too prideful to say god i need
[1:42:04] more of you i need another refilling of
[1:42:07] the holy ghost
[1:42:08] there's been some leakage in my life
[1:42:12] i've not been praying like i ought to
[1:42:14] pray i've not been reading like an
[1:42:16] artery i'ma talk about don't make it
[1:42:18] laborious
[1:42:19] but god i've not been drawing strength
[1:42:21] from you the way that i need to
[1:42:25] he is your source of strength
[1:42:28] let me tell you friends you could speak
[1:42:30] to me a month of sundays and unless you
[1:42:33] receive the word of god and feed on that
[1:42:35] word it'll never do you any good
[1:42:38] that's right
[1:42:39] i love you as your pastor i'm here to
[1:42:41] help anybody that i can to direct you
[1:42:42] along the way but god never sent me here
[1:42:44] to replace the holy ghost
[1:42:47] i'm not your holy ghost
[1:42:49] i'm only a tool in the hand of god that
[1:42:52] god would use to speak to you and reveal
[1:42:55] his love and his care and his mercy and
[1:42:57] direct to direct in your life and speak
[1:42:59] of things that's going on call things
[1:43:01] out ahead of time and where things are
[1:43:03] about ready to make a decision the
[1:43:04] spirit of god can come right down
[1:43:06] through the word and send an influence
[1:43:08] of the holy spirit on your life turn
[1:43:10] from that don't go that way amen
[1:43:16] daniel wasn't on the scene
[1:43:19] it's time for them to make a stand
[1:43:22] but in the midst of that time
[1:43:25] they made a stand
[1:43:27] god didn't remove the fire
[1:43:30] but god gave him grace to go through it
[1:43:34] daniel in the lion's den
[1:43:37] here's daniel
[1:43:38] you know the king the bible says this in
[1:43:40] daniel 6.
[1:43:43] the king
[1:43:46] he knew
[1:43:48] what that men had done
[1:43:51] the bible says that
[1:43:53] he knew
[1:43:54] and the bible says he
[1:43:56] he he tried
[1:43:59] to deliver daniel right
[1:44:02] true
[1:44:03] but the law of the media's of purge
[1:44:06] persons once you write it it cannot be
[1:44:07] altered
[1:44:09] right you know that in the book of
[1:44:10] daniel also an esther
[1:44:12] so that word cannot be altered that's
[1:44:14] come out
[1:44:16] but there was another word
[1:44:20] that was before that word ever came
[1:44:21] about
[1:44:23] that was a way that had already made its
[1:44:25] way into the heart and life of a
[1:44:28] believer and that word was the kingdom
[1:44:32] that word was power that word gave
[1:44:35] strength for daniel to be able to look
[1:44:38] past that word and say there's another
[1:44:40] word
[1:44:42] you're a king but i've got the word of
[1:44:43] the king
[1:44:45] come on the swords in my hands come on
[1:44:48] that representation out there in sabino
[1:44:50] canyon was not just for the prophet in
[1:44:52] this hour but all who will come under
[1:44:55] the authority of the revelation in this
[1:44:58] hour and be filled with the same spirit
[1:45:00] of god and be united with that word you
[1:45:03] walk as a child of god with the sword in
[1:45:05] your hand
[1:45:07] come on now the sword has been delivered
[1:45:11] to the church of the living god
[1:45:14] and had not been delivered by a church
[1:45:17] it was not delivered by man god himself
[1:45:20] came down in the ministry of malachi 4
[1:45:24] and anointed a church for rapture and
[1:45:27] overcoming power and that sword is
[1:45:31] placed in the hand in the authority in
[1:45:34] the heart in the life of the believer
[1:45:38] hallelujah
[1:45:52] daniel
[1:45:55] is your god able to deliver you
[1:45:57] what's his testimony
[1:45:59] whom thou servist
[1:46:01] continually
[1:46:03] in other words daniel i know your life
[1:46:04] your knife's not your life's not a hit
[1:46:06] and miss
[1:46:07] it's not a hit and a miss in the kingdom
[1:46:09] right
[1:46:09] but then again he wouldn't
[1:46:11] like brother and said it's okay to miss
[1:46:12] a day of work but don't miss church
[1:46:15] i mean we still believe that don't we
[1:46:18] or has that been altered
[1:46:21] come on now
[1:46:23] we're talking about an unaltered word
[1:46:27] unaltered
[1:46:30] here is daniel
[1:46:36] walks into that lion's den it's placed
[1:46:38] in there a seal is placed upon it and i
[1:46:40] know you know the story
[1:46:42] the account of it
[1:46:44] but here it is
[1:46:46] put it
[1:46:47] to where it's
[1:46:49] your life
[1:46:51] and you've walked in
[1:46:53] to a lion's den
[1:46:55] remember paul dealt with individuals
[1:46:57] that weren't exactly lions
[1:46:59] but paul could speak i've been delivered
[1:47:01] out of the mouth of lions
[1:47:04] that which was in opposition
[1:47:07] to the word of god
[1:47:09] and satan is in opposition to the word
[1:47:12] of god
[1:47:13] that's enthroned
[1:47:14] in your life
[1:47:18] and here was daniel in that moment
[1:47:22] the next morning man the king was up all
[1:47:23] night
[1:47:26] he comes down there daniel
[1:47:28] daniel
[1:47:33] king didn't need an alarm that morning
[1:47:36] when he no longer
[1:47:39] he was waiting
[1:47:41] he went down there daniel said
[1:47:43] live okay
[1:47:46] let me just tell you right now
[1:47:49] god hath sent his angel
[1:47:55] what you say daniel i'm telling you i've
[1:47:57] had fellowship down here
[1:48:01] you have fellowship down there all you
[1:48:03] see i've already been in fellowship
[1:48:06] under the blood
[1:48:08] and i've taken that experience
[1:48:11] down here
[1:48:15] daniel what was it like
[1:48:19] i love how brother brown describes it
[1:48:22] daniel's in a testimony meeting and he
[1:48:24] says all of a sudden he said i started
[1:48:27] feeling he said every fiber of my body
[1:48:29] started quivering
[1:48:30] he said i was standing there he said i
[1:48:31] could hear the pads
[1:48:34] of those lions walking
[1:48:35] i could hear him coming up next to me
[1:48:38] he said
[1:48:39] but i said there was something came over
[1:48:41] every fiber of my being i felt a
[1:48:43] tingling felt this i felt sensation
[1:48:51] and he said before you know what he said
[1:48:53] they started just turning away he said i
[1:48:55] looked over in the corner and there
[1:48:57] stood the son of god
[1:49:00] oh glory you see what it was what he
[1:49:03] sensed
[1:49:04] what he sensed
[1:49:06] was not just a feeling
[1:49:08] it was the presence
[1:49:11] of the angel
[1:49:13] of the lord
[1:49:16] and you know what god was saying you've
[1:49:18] stood for me
[1:49:20] i'm going to stand
[1:49:22] first
[1:49:25] when the hebrew children made their
[1:49:26] stand god let them make it he said you
[1:49:28] stood for me
[1:49:29] now i'm going to stand
[1:49:31] for you
[1:49:36] i tell you if there's nothing else many
[1:49:38] things that you know that could take
[1:49:40] from this service this morning
[1:49:42] encouragement
[1:49:43] to say god
[1:49:45] if your responses have not been
[1:49:46] responses that's been according to the
[1:49:49] word and things that you could say
[1:49:51] lord i i'm thankful for that and no
[1:49:54] doubt all throughout this building we
[1:49:55] could we could testify to that but i
[1:49:58] would look to the grace of god this
[1:49:59] morning and say god
[1:50:01] i want to renew
[1:50:03] and i lord jesus want to be able to
[1:50:06] stand there with an unaltered
[1:50:09] response
[1:50:11] i want to stand there with that kind of
[1:50:12] a heart that's able to stand in that
[1:50:15] moment
[1:50:17] and if you're here this morning and you
[1:50:18] don't have that victory on the inside
[1:50:21] don't wait for it
[1:50:25] accept it down
[1:50:26] into your life it'll give you strength
[1:50:29] in your life to stand
[1:50:31] against the wiles of the enemy
[1:50:33] because it gives you a strength on the
[1:50:36] inside oh sure sometimes pressures can
[1:50:38] come and you might have friends here
[1:50:40] have this one here and say well what
[1:50:42] about this in your life or or this
[1:50:43] family member can come but there's a
[1:50:45] greater love on the inside

[1:53:03] i don't want an up and down life
[1:53:06] i don't want an in and out life
[1:53:09] i don't want a life that depends on
[1:53:10] whether the sun is shining
[1:53:13] or it's raining outside
[1:53:16] skies are covered over i i don't want to
[1:53:18] depend upon the natural elements
[1:53:21] i don't even want a life that depends
[1:53:23] upon
[1:53:24] candlelight in the inner court
[1:53:26] because that candlelight can be blown
[1:53:28] out
[1:53:30] lord i want an experience that's deeper
[1:53:33] than my flesh
[1:53:35] than my spirit
[1:53:37] i want to experience this down
[1:53:39] in the depths of my soul
[1:53:42] granted lord this morning
[1:53:45] may it be the earnest that would rise up
[1:53:47] in that heart lord
[1:53:49] to purpose in their heart and life
[1:53:53] that that promise
[1:53:55] is mine
[1:53:57] and that promise
[1:53:59] i'm going to lay hold on that
[1:54:01] by surrendering all that i am
[1:54:04] the lord i want
[1:54:07] you lord
[1:54:08] to be enthroned in my life
[1:54:12] grant that lord i pray this morning
[1:54:14] [Music]
[1:54:15] lord forgive us
[1:54:17] [Music]
[1:54:18] lord
[1:54:20] we don't take these things lightly
[1:54:25] we want to grow
[1:54:27] we want to mature
[1:54:30] we realize lord that
[1:54:32] we don't mature overnight
[1:54:35] sometimes lord we see that even in the
[1:54:37] natural progression
[1:54:38] in natural life
[1:54:40] every one of us lord has come through
[1:54:41] those stages in life where we thought we
[1:54:43] knew everything
[1:54:45] we thought we knew this and thought we
[1:54:47] knew that
[1:54:50] lord it's so amazing that even as the
[1:54:51] order that i get and even when my daddy
[1:54:53] is
[1:54:54] not here with me
[1:54:56] i can look back and think back over
[1:54:58] counsel
[1:55:00] i can think back over things that he
[1:55:01] told me
[1:55:04] when i was a boy
[1:55:06] things that he told me lord when i began
[1:55:07] to pastor on and on and on
[1:55:11] lord jesus
[1:55:13] but i'm so thankful for your grace
[1:55:17] that lord just as it was with abraham
[1:55:19] and sarah
[1:55:22] there's nothing that they could look
[1:55:23] back on and say they they couldn't and
[1:55:25] say every one of my responses were
[1:55:28] right on the money
[1:55:32] but yet lord there's one thing that
[1:55:35] never deviated
[1:55:38] they were tied to that word
[1:55:41] and when something was wrong
[1:55:44] in your presence they were willing to
[1:55:47] make it right
[1:55:48] [Music]
[1:55:50] they were willing lord to be realigned
[1:55:53] lord jesus
[1:55:55] help us
[1:55:56] as fathers mothers brothers sisters
[1:55:59] husbands wives on and on and on
[1:56:02] lord god i pray may the windows of our
[1:56:04] home
[1:56:06] may the windows of our home
[1:56:08] may not be windows that's open to sodom
[1:56:12] may not be windows without screens that
[1:56:14] just lets every influence of the world
[1:56:17] in
[1:56:19] but god may there be screens that are
[1:56:21] put up
[1:56:24] screams lord god
[1:56:26] of the filter of the word of god
[1:56:30] lord jesus are realizing that even as
[1:56:32] parents
[1:56:34] we need that discernment of the holy
[1:56:35] ghost
[1:56:37] lord in this hour we need to be very
[1:56:39] vigilant
[1:56:42] very intentional not just his parents
[1:56:44] but in every every one of us that's here
[1:56:47] we must be vigilant in this hour
[1:56:50] because as the scripture said that satan
[1:56:53] is as
[1:56:55] a roaring lion
[1:56:56] seeking
[1:56:58] whom he may
[1:57:00] devour
[1:57:02] he'd love nothing more than to swallow
[1:57:04] up
[1:57:05] your walk with god
[1:57:07] he'd love nothing more
[1:57:11] than to swallow up
[1:57:13] where victory only becomes something of
[1:57:15] a past memory
[1:57:18] by the samuel what should i do well
[1:57:20] right now i i would
[1:57:22] i would look to god and i would say lord
[1:57:24] forgive me for neglecting
[1:57:27] my walk with you
[1:57:28] [Music]
[1:57:30] well brother samuel but i thought that
[1:57:33] greater is he that's in me
[1:57:35] he is greater
[1:57:37] but also remember the prophet told us
[1:57:40] he said if you don't feed the holy ghost
[1:57:43] in your life
[1:57:44] it'll die
[1:57:46] now the holy ghost is god he can't die
[1:57:50] but what does he mean we're losing
[1:57:53] the effectiveness of how you should live
[1:57:56] as a son and daughter of good
[1:57:59] your life
[1:58:00] was meant to live
[1:58:02] and walk
[1:58:03] in victory
[1:58:05] and if satan has stolen that from you
[1:58:07] stolen joy from your life look who stole
[1:58:09] it from you
[1:58:11] what do i do
[1:58:12] take it back
[1:58:14] take it back how do i take it back you
[1:58:16] take it back just as it was taken from
[1:58:18] you little by little you take it back
[1:58:21] even at this moment
[1:58:23] set your heart and a purpose before god
[1:58:27] that i'm going to take back
[1:58:30] those times i'm not going to compromise
[1:58:32] on times opportunities i'm not going to
[1:58:35] compromise on the word of god
[1:58:36] [Music]
[1:58:40] oh my
[1:58:41] granted lord jesus
[1:58:44] granted lord i pray
[1:58:46] [Music]
[1:58:47] lord we thank you for your mercy oh my
[1:58:50] just the sweetness of your holy spirit
[1:58:52] lord god
[1:58:54] your mercy lord right here this morning
[1:58:56] lord god you're the same god
[1:58:58] right here this morning lord that came
[1:59:00] right there to daniel that came right
[1:59:02] there lord god in the fiery furnace
[1:59:05] you're the same god right here this
[1:59:06] morning
[1:59:08] lord jesus you didn't remove the lines
[1:59:10] you didn't remove the fire
[1:59:13] but you came and stood in the midst of
[1:59:15] the fire
[1:59:16] you stood in the midst of the lions
[1:59:20] sometimes lord with things that
[1:59:21] different ones the lord as they go
[1:59:23] through
[1:59:24] satan sometimes can beat them up and
[1:59:26] want to tell them well if you really
[1:59:27] have faith you still wouldn't be
[1:59:29] suffering with that back condition if
[1:59:30] you really had faith you wouldn't be
[1:59:32] dealing with this right now he's a liar
[1:59:34] [Music]
[1:59:36] paul dealt with conditions in his eyes
[1:59:39] over and over and over again but paul
[1:59:41] realized paul never stopped praying but
[1:59:44] paul realized
[1:59:46] this is not going to dictate
[1:59:49] how i'm going to conduct myself as a
[1:59:51] child of god
[1:59:53] i will glory in my infirmities
[1:59:56] that the power of christ
[1:59:59] might rest upon my life
[2:00:01] [Music]
[2:00:02] lord jesus
[2:00:04] may they just invite you lord i invite
[2:00:07] you
[2:00:08] that as you stood with them in the fire
[2:00:11] stood with them in the lion's den that
[2:00:13] god that you're standing with me lord
[2:00:16] then lord jesus
[2:00:19] your word remains true you're the lord
[2:00:21] that healeth all
[2:00:24] our diseases
[2:00:26] whenever my healing will come
[2:00:29] whatever moment that it's manifested in
[2:00:32] whether it's manifested in this life or
[2:00:35] the life to come i am going to stand
[2:00:38] with the testimony
[2:00:40] unaltered that god is my healer
[2:00:44] god is my deliverer god is my joy god is
[2:00:49] my happiness
[2:00:51] he is my delight he is my refuge
[2:00:56] granted lord jesus
[2:00:58] unaltered
[2:01:00] is our response
[2:01:03] granted lord this morning i pray
[2:01:08] oh thank you father
[2:01:10] thank you jesus

[2:01:14] hands
[2:01:16] oh my maybe it's been a while since you
[2:01:18] raised your hands but let remember what
[2:01:19] the hand is erasing and signification of
[2:01:22] i surrender lord
[2:01:24] i surrender i lord i can't make things
[2:01:26] happen lord i i just surrender to your
[2:01:28] word lord god
[2:01:30] remember how the prophet told us in the
[2:01:32] message contest the strength of the
[2:01:34] church is to accept the word of god
[2:01:37] to just accept it and stand on it it's
[2:01:40] our promises he gave them to us he made
[2:01:42] them with us in mind so we must stand
[2:01:45] and be sour unaltered
[2:01:48] unaltered
[2:01:49] our response
[2:01:52] oh hallelujah don't you love him
[2:01:54] [Music]
[2:01:57] oh my god let's just stand
[2:02:00] if you'd like to stand if you need to
[2:02:02] sit that's fine as well
[2:02:07] amen
[2:02:08] let's just take a few moments here
[2:02:11] let's just worship
[2:02:14] oh my i'd say they really had a time
[2:02:16] right there in
[2:02:17] the fiery furnace
[2:02:19] and no doubt they had a time
[2:02:23] and the lion's den
[2:02:24] [Music]
[2:02:27] sometimes you know i know as i speak
[2:02:29] throughout
[2:02:31] different ones
[2:02:32] every one of us here there's been times
[2:02:35] that maybe you didn't even have voice to
[2:02:37] sing a song
[2:02:39] maybe there's things that
[2:02:41] you didn't even you couldn't even move
[2:02:42] your hands to clap your hands maybe your
[2:02:44] legs
[2:02:45] you didn't have strength to be able to
[2:02:46] stand up
[2:02:48] but it's something about how you can
[2:02:49] begin to just think of the lord
[2:02:53] you just start to think about it
[2:02:56] hallelujah
[2:02:57] as you begin to dwell on him and begin
[2:02:59] to think of his goodness there's a
[2:03:00] song maybe a scripture or just maybe
[2:03:02] just lord i love you
[2:03:04] and all of a sudden you
[2:03:10] better know what i'm talking about
[2:03:13] he just moves right in like that
[2:03:15] what is it it's the same god who was in
[2:03:17] the lion's den
[2:03:18] [Music]
[2:03:20] it's the same god it's not about our
[2:03:22] voice it's not about even the position
[2:03:24] of our body
[2:03:25] it's unaltered
[2:03:26] our response and here he comes
[2:03:29] in the midst of that time
[2:03:32] oh my
[2:03:33] paul and silas
[2:03:35] it wasn't a fitting setting
[2:03:37] to have a worship service
[2:03:40] matter of fact in their body it wasn't a
[2:03:41] fitting time in their body
[2:03:46] they had their clothes was sticking to
[2:03:47] them

[2:03:51] right
[2:03:52] but in the midst of that time
[2:03:54] they just started to praise the lord it
[2:03:56] might have started with just a little
[2:04:01] amen
[2:04:03] god
[2:04:06] every
[2:04:07] they may not even been in temple
[2:04:10] eventually they got going
[2:04:12] amen
[2:04:13] how
[2:04:14] they begin to think upon him
[2:04:16] think upon his goodness
[2:04:18] think upon his mercy
[2:04:21] and invite him
[2:04:22] amen
[2:04:30] nothing less
