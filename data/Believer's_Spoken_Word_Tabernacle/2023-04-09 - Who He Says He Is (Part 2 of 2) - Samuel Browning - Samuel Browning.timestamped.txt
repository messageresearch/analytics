[0:00] as him there's someone that's greater
[0:03] and is one that I have need of
[0:07] and then that's what brings true
[0:09] repentance and abhorrence for our sins
[0:14] and walking into the Waters of baptism
[0:16] as a candidate I am a candidate I'm
[0:20] identifying I'm registering a claim on
[0:25] the policy
[0:26] to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[0:30] because it produces more than a good
[0:33] life
[0:34] oh sure it produces a good life you can
[0:36] only you can live right around the
[0:37] church and live a good life but the Holy
[0:40] Ghost is more than you live in a good
[0:41] moral upright life
[0:43] are you hearing me
[0:45] the Holy Ghost itself is a life that's
[0:47] quickened
[0:49] by the word of God
[0:51] it's alive
[0:52] where Christ is your everything
[0:58] you friends it's one thing to say is but
[1:01] let the Holy Spirit look back down over
[1:03] your life
[1:04] and is he really everything in your life
[1:08] is he your all in all
[1:10] is he the one that you base every
[1:12] decision on is your life really on fire
[1:14] for god well brother Sammy I don't
[1:16] believe you've got to be on fire you do
[1:18] in order to go in the rapture
[1:22] and if you don't get on fire there'll be
[1:24] something come along and it'll take you
[1:25] right out
[1:27] come on friends and you won't be able to
[1:28] blame it on nobody else no job no
[1:30] situation listen it's between you and
[1:33] God not between you and your neighbor
[1:35] you and your husband you and your wife
[1:37] you and your family you and your church
[1:39] it's between you and God
[1:42] when you stand there that day nobody
[1:44] will be able to point a finger at
[1:45] anybody else and say well it's their
[1:47] fault nope it's between us and God
[1:55] I say let our lives
[1:57] display the wave sheath
[1:59] over our children
[2:03] waving what is it
[2:05] there's more to come
[2:07] let our lives be lived let the wave
[2:09] sheath be waved in our homes we're

[4:01] reason for a purpose
[4:03] let's just let's let's receive that

[4:08] benefit if you need the Holy Ghost draw

[4:14] benefit if you need healing draw upon
[4:17] that benefit if you need deliverance
[4:19] from a besetting sin draw upon that
[4:21] benefit this morning
[4:23] Heavenly Father
[4:27] Lord Jesus
[4:30] you are indeed
[4:32] who you say you are
[4:34] you declare
[4:36] yourself to be the same
[4:39] right here Among Us
[4:41] and in the hearts
[4:43] of your people
[4:45] you're still the same yesterday
[4:48] today and forever
[4:51] Lord my heart thinks of that song
[4:54] he's alive and well living in me to tell
[4:59] the world that is still the same
[5:03] Lord
[5:05] that's what you're declaring right here
[5:07] this morning
[5:08] that's what you declare
[5:10] in our homes
[5:12] that's what you declare Lord sometimes
[5:14] we don't even know why we've gotten
[5:16] moved to different Associates or we had
[5:18] to go from one store to a different
[5:19] store sometimes we don't understand all
[5:22] that Lord maybe sometimes our traffic is
[5:24] blocked this way and then we're going
[5:26] this way and we Lord
[5:31] that we recognize Lord
[5:33] Our Lives
[5:35] it's that Lord with every movement
[5:38] Let It Be Lord God under the unction of
[5:41] the rushing Mighty Wind
[5:44] of that wave sheath being waved in our
[5:46] lives Lord
[5:48] it changes how we Act
[5:50] it changes how we look
[5:52] we live different Lord here's a witness
[5:55] that comes in our lives that we have
[5:58] passed from Death unto life
[6:03] and oh God how there is just absolutely
[6:05] no greater manifestation
[6:09] of your Victory on Calvary and rising
[6:13] from the grave then the revealing
[6:16] of yourself
[6:19] in our lives and through our lives
[6:22] that's the victory
[6:24] the victory that Calvary
[6:28] and the resurrection has brought to us
[6:32] Lord
[6:34] for each need
[6:36] that's gathered here this morning
[6:39] hands that have been lifted and raised
[6:43] you know the benefit
[6:45] that Lord that is needed at this present
[6:49] moment in their life
[6:52] and we like Abraham like Isaac like each
[6:56] one of your children when you would make
[6:58] yourself known to them they would begin
[7:01] to Worship You Lord in that appearing
[7:04] and they would give themselves to you
[7:07] Lord Jesus
[7:09] so likewise Lord as you've said in your
[7:12] word
[7:12] David would utter with his voice from
[7:15] his heart bless the Lord O my soul and
[7:18] all that is within me
[7:21] forget not the Lord and all his benefits
[7:25] I'm the Lord that forgiveth all that
[7:28] iniquities
[7:29] I'm the Lord
[7:31] that healeth all thy diseases
[7:35] glory be to God
[7:38] you're the same one Lord who restoreth
[7:41] my soul
[7:42] you're the same God
[7:44] who moves Lord and brings Deliverance
[7:47] and steal the Lord God
[7:49] makes real the policy
[7:53] to policyholders
[7:55] that God had no longer becomes something
[7:58] we are fellowshipping around
[8:01] something we just hold in our hand
[8:04] but it's something that comes into our
[8:06] hearts
[8:07] and it's got a hold of us
[8:08] [Music]
[8:10] I pray God this morning if there's one
[8:12] that doesn't know you in that way
[8:15] may they come to that place
[8:18] may this be a moment right here this
[8:20] morning
[8:21] that God no matter where that life and
[8:24] no matter what it is may it be a moment
[8:27] that as you've appeared to him
[8:29] may they not Lord God allow doubt to
[8:32] come in but may they worship you
[8:34] in your appearing
[8:36] and give themselves like that little
[8:38] mechanic who obeyed the voice of the
[8:42] chief engineer
[8:45] well maybe there's wires that they tried
[8:47] to hook up in their life they tried to
[8:49] make promises live
[8:51] but right now Under The Obedience and
[8:54] the authority of the Holy Spirit
[8:56] [Music]
[8:58] you're giving a direction in their heart
[9:00] on the inside says yea Lord
[9:03] be it unto me Lord according to Thy Word
[9:07] then Lord you know how to touch wire
[9:09] with what in each part
[9:12] or we want to obey you we want to move
[9:15] we want to go beyond doubts go beyond
[9:17] all that that's what you're appearing
[9:19] has come is to dismantle every doubt
[9:22] your appearing has come
[9:25] to dismantle every thought of
[9:27] unworthiness
[9:30] you're appearing to us personally
[9:33] lets us know who we are and what you
[9:37] think about us
[9:38] glory be to God in the highest
[9:46] caiaphasis when you Rose
[9:48] but you appeared to chosen ones who
[9:52] believed you already
[9:55] so lord it's not a random act this
[9:57] morning nor in any service when you come
[10:00] and make yourself known to your children
[10:04] the predestined plan
[10:06] of the foreknowledge of God
[10:08] [Music]
[10:10] Lord right here this morning
[10:14] prayers that have been troubled
[10:16] we want to draw
[10:18] upon the benefits of this policy
[10:21] [Music]
[10:22] we're not people who don't know the
[10:25] policy maybe there's some here this
[10:27] morning might be their first time I
[10:30] don't know
[10:31] but God if our names are included in
[10:33] that policy then the word has come
[10:36] appeared to us
[10:38] to minister the rights that belong to us
[10:41] as Sons and Daughters of God
[10:43] [Music]
[10:45] and father if there's anyone that's been
[10:47] robbed of being a son and daughter of
[10:48] God
[10:50] maybe there's been benefits
[10:53] that the enemy has wanted to keep from
[10:55] them
[10:56] but I pray right here this morning God
[11:00] may you move down lord God for every
[11:03] need that's here
[11:06] the enemy that's wanted to trouble him
[11:07] Lord about their past may I pray God the
[11:10] justifier this morning Lord God is in
[11:12] the building right now
[11:14] that you move right down lord God into
[11:17] that life
[11:19] granted Lord
[11:21] that perfect love
[11:24] to cast out
[11:25] all fear
[11:28] for you've not given us
[11:30] spirit of fear
[11:32] but of power
[11:34] of love
[11:36] and of a sound mind
[11:39] blessed be the name
[11:41] of the Lord
[11:44] you've quickened us Lord from Death unto
[11:46] life
[11:47] we were once dead in sin and trespasses
[11:51] but you came to us
[11:53] oh Jesus
[11:55] some of the places you found us and the
[11:57] conditions you found to sin Lord
[11:59] [Music]
[12:01] but you came to us
[12:05] glory be to God
[12:09] the conditions did not stop you from
[12:11] coming
[12:12] but it was because Lord you came to us
[12:16] and begin to deal with our hearts
[12:19] maybe Lord with some maybe it was a
[12:21] track that they read at first
[12:23] [Music]
[12:24] maybe it wasn't even a message track
[12:26] maybe Lord they had stumbled in Lord to
[12:29] a Baptist Church
[12:31] and they Lord God had just felt a pool
[12:33] to receive you as their lord and savior
[12:38] but there was a hunger
[12:42] hunger thing but there was something
[12:45] Lord God that was calling
[12:47] a yearning a desire
[12:50] something that Lord God could not even
[12:52] be explained
[12:55] but it was for more of you
[12:57] [Music]
[12:59] Lord I'm so glad that you have not left
[13:01] it to us to find our way
[13:04] I'm glad Lord even right here this
[13:06] morning Lord there might be situations
[13:08] Lord that lives and hearts can be so
[13:11] entrenched in Lord that they can look
[13:13] for an Avenue and a door and he looks
[13:16] around I don't see no door but oh God
[13:18] you're the same God who came in the
[13:21] fiery furnace Lord God and made a way
[13:24] you're the same God who came down lord
[13:26] in Daniel Lord with Daniel and the
[13:29] Lion's Den you made a way Lord

[13:47] God
[13:51] but you came to me Lord you came to us
[13:55] and that appearing
[13:58] was to make known
[14:00] the purpose and the grace
[14:03] that lay in you
[14:05] before the foundation of the world now

[14:18] that we're putting on Earth
