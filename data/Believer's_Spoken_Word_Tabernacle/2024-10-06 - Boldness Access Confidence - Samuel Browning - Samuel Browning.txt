amen here in in Fellowship this morning amen just so looking forward to what the Lord would have for us amen we just so thankful for his mercy here this morning and amen and just want to uh continue to uh keep those in prayer with everything I know the announcement was read but with everything that is there uh from the hurricane that went through there in the western part um Friday evening uh I went down to support the meetings there Bible Believers for the evening and was just talking with brother Josh Bennett and just um I know I've been getting text from a lot of different Brothers in a lot of the U surrounding areas but it's about 50 about 50 U miles or 50 minutes from him where it took place so everything you know is confined within the Western part and then you see in the eastern part of Tennessee and uh uh I don't know some of you that have uh your Instagram and Facebook and other things like that you uh certainly brother Donnie and them don't put it out like that there's been a lot they've done over the years that no one knows about but their their whole church that that building has become a command center wow not by the government but but you know they've but I'll tell you what there's been a lot of resources that have already um pass through there and so um I just we will make sure we get that out by email if you would like to send and contribute there's many ways that you can uh within that effort and um we just ask that the Lord would just take and just what is given and just Supply it and that's the way no matter what what we can do little as much when God is in it and um there's a lot of testimonies that even has come in and that's really been my prayer and I I think the prayer of many others as well is that God within this situation the lives that were would be touched you know to come to the realization that they they really need the Lord Jesus Christ and uh it's just I know we've seen the videos no doubt some of you have seen the videos and the pictures and things it's just [Music] absolutely I don't know how else to describe it you know some of those places and Roads I've been through there and it's just amazing how some of those places are so where where it's gone and washed away and we have that other hurricane they say that that's forming and I don't know how they name these hurricanes I don't know who names them I don't know if they name them after people they don't like or who how they do this I don't know you know um I remember one one of the years we had a Hur we had two hurricanes that came through that were named after two sisters in our church church and so uh you know so that was quite it was quite something you know we just don't want no hurricanes inside the body here but um we want to just pray because that's going to they're looking for that to come like in the Tampa area and then the same kind of the same pathway and so let's just really let's just really be in prayer God will just turn that amen turn that around how many believe he's more than enough to do thaten we've seen that amen we've seen it not just what we read in the prophet's life we see it in the scriptures but we've witnessed that already happened with with another hurricane amen so let's just keep that in prayer and um there's a few needs that I I want you just to kind of keep before us and maybe the brothers as they lead songs if we just always have this prayer request before us and that is um it's it's always on my heart and that's brother Ron Spencer and then um some of you know brother Keith Buchanan from down in brother Barry's and he's dealing with a a therosis of the liver that has nothing to do with drinking or anything it just is a a condition and he he needs a real intervention from God and it's been it's been quite quite some time that that's going on and and also sister Bethany Lawson those are three that just really and I know there's many other needs I I know that that throughout the body and that's how I always talk to the Lord Lord I know there's many other needs than just be on these three but you know God has people on the other side of the world to pray about those needs over there I don't know how you feel but sometimes I you know things can be mentioned to me and yes I've prayed about it but maybe not with the frequency and I think ah man I man the but you know what we're a body and if and you know how it is if we and every need is important friends I'm not saying that it's not but you know how with everything that we can have up our minds but you know what's so important is that as it's brought to our hearts and just when it comes to your heart you might be in the middle of the grocery store just right at that moment say Lord just remember remember them in prayer Lord maybe you're on the job it comes to you where wherever it comes just just you know just like somebody else that comes to your heart just offer it up in prayer amen you love him amen amen you're not going to count this time against me amen we certainly love you and appreciate you and uh let's just stand if we could and uh we want to go right into the word and I so appreciate the song service appreciate the specials that were sung I think they're on but I think that I'm uh I want to go to Ephesians chapter 3 and um want to look here and I I'd like to read the whole chapter but I'm not going to for sake of time um but I would like to start in with verse eight and begin there and Paul is uh expressing uh to the Believers of this mystery and Revelation that God had hidden from before the foundation of the world and remember that mystery was that God would take a people for his name sake remember that the bride herself this is what this is what brings the difference between just churches and the Bride of Jesus Christ that we read about in Revelations 19 and we believe that we are a part of that God has been making up a gentile bride and all of this has been a mystery that was hidden but then after Calvary remember his side was opened at Calvary and out of his side came the water the blood and the spirit is that right and those those three coming together agree in one and then all of that was given in order to bring forth what was taken out of his side then there would be a bride like Adam when Adam was put to sleep a side was open and what was taken out of him was his bride and so that's where the Bride of Jes Jesus Christ is coming from the mind of God always been a part of the word so it's not something that we are we are going to be but it's actually God bringing forth what he's already placed within our lives and so it's God working in our lives to bring this mystery forth in our lives for the Bride of Jesus Christ and she's a she is a lovely lady of the word of God for the bride of Christ there's not one promise in the word that she cannot say Amen to and stand upon every word is true because to deny one word is to deny the headship of the word is that right so here Paul picks this up and he's saying now is the time you know that it has been revealed and I'm so thankful to be living in that time in verse eight unto me who am less than the least of All Saints is this Grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles The unsearchable Riches of Christ now in verse nine and to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery now we know not all will and it isn't that Paul is going to have some great convincing argument but Paul is given by the grace of God the Revelation to speak in that hour and it will be Christ himself that will make himself known to you and I what belongs to you and I it'd be like in the reading of a will if your name's not in there it'll never have any meaning to it but when the will is being read your name is in there and there's a meaning to it and that's where the Holy Spirit comes to open our understanding of what belongs to you and I is that right so that's why even when it comes to every everything that God has for us which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God who created All Things by Jesus Christ to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in Heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God according to the Eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our lord in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him so this is not our faith now this is his faith operating through our lives amen Paul says wherefore I desire that you faint not at my tribulations for you which is your glory for this cause I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in Heaven and Earth is named that he would Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man that Christ here's the purpose that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height and to know the love of Christ which passeth on passeth knowledge that you might be filled with all the fullness of God now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we could ask or think he he's beyond what we could ask or think yes sir he's working in our life and Beyond there's nothing that's too big that he is not exalted above that Hallelujah no matter what situation no matter what need no matter what besetting sin there's nothing that is too great that the name of Jesus Christ could not be placed above it now unto him that is able to to do exceedingly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in US unto him be glory in the Church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages World Without End Amen let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer Heavenly Father how we thank you for your mercies Lord here this morning we thank you dear God for the grace of God that's been extended to us Lord in this hour and father that our eyes Lord would be anointed to see to see clearly to see you father and oh God to see ourselves Lord in you in the vision in the word Lord father we're asking tonight May Lord the same Holy Spirit Lord that God has moved with inspiration Lord upon those who wrote those scriptures Lord may you come Lord I pray and Lord just open this word to our hearts Lord speak to every need Lord we completely Reserve Lord ourselves to you that in everything you might receive Glory and Honor Lord we commit this service Lord into your hands now in the name name of Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you as you're being seated amen I want to I'd like to speak here um this morning if you can go ahead and switch it over for me please I'd like to go ahead and speak here this morning on on this thought just three words out of out of the verse that we had read boldness access and confidence and uh this is certainly God's this is God's 's desire and this is something that no one no one can can produce this of boldness this access we have this confidence outside of Christ himself so this is not a facade this is not something that has come from a pep rally or a work up but this is something that comes from a settl that has come within the heart of the believer that we know where we're standing with God and this is where in the scriptures that we read it's very very clear according to the Eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our lord now notice how he wrote this he purposed this in Christ Jesus the anointed word our Lord and this purpose was not something that has just been developed you know it's not like you or I Who start uh upon a project and then you make modifications to it and think H I think this is a little bit better over here uh this trim would look better over here uh this paint collar that's not how God operates God already in his mind before there was atom or molecule God is the is eternal and so he had everything laid out from the beginning to the end God had everything laid out and all everything in our our finite Minds it's so hard for us in our minds to grasp that because uh our minds are not meant to be able to grasp the infinite God because we work in a level of the of the finiteness of if I could say that of where as I said before we make changes and alterations and oh that was bad and this is good but God has never had a new thought God's never had to use an eraser to erase something that he ever thought because remember before it could ever be a word it was a thought amen is that right we were in God's thoughts before the foundation of the world Paul writes of that even through Ephesians you see this is the real thing that brings stability in the life of the believer is when that vision of the word can break Upon Our Lives to recognize I'm not a beggar I'm not a foreigner I'm not a stranger as a matter of fact what it is that is a desire in my life I'm seeing it set before me and I have a right to the promises of God that's what the gospel comes to make us aware of and to administer those rights to you and I notice verse 12 in whom this is where very important in him we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him so when we look at this this boldness it's a boldness it's a freedom in speaking now listen I'm not talking about somebody and and I'm I'm saying these things to be funny because you know we all know people who who who who need to actually think more before they speak right the Bible gave you know God gave us he didn't give us two mouths and one ear he gave us two ears in one mouth and you know the thing that when we're talking about this freedom in speaking we're not talking about just being a loose cannon we're not talking about somebody that's just you know open mouth insert foot we're not talking about that we're talking about a freedom in that that there is nothing hindering me from declaring what the word says that I am there's nothing hindering me from looking to the promise of God and say healing belongs to me Deliverance belongs to me my children belong to me God has said this in his word it's a freedom in speaking in other words I'm not tied nobody has any ties on me right are you hearing me it's kind of like you know a politician that has no Lobby groups tied to it it's dangerous it's scary because he owes nobody nothing but you see when a man when a man listen to me when a man or woman can be so separated to God to the devil has no tie upon your life then comes a boldness of freedom in speaking an openness of frankness in speech uh a a free and fearless confidence cheerful courage boldness and Assurance in other words I'm not worried about backsliding I'm not I'm not focused upon that that fear has been driven out of my life you say how does that happen because when God takes a hold of your life and the holy spirit moves in your life God continues to build confidence after confidence in your life to where he God is letting you know that it's not you that's doing it it is me that is doing it I'm the one that's doing it he drives out any lack of confidence oh there's nothing as powerful as the word to bring a real boldness in our lives and that access that we have we have an approach to God a relationship with God we're not Beggars we're not strangers and we did not become sons of God on a certain day we always were Sons and Daughters of God the prodal son was always a Son of God he got away from the father's house but he was always a Son of God he had to come to himself and recognize where he was at and when he was in the midst of the pig pin his thoughts were changed his heart was being changed toward home oh my what he once tried to run from and get away from but let me tell you if you belong to God you can run run run but you'll never outrun the predestination of almighty God God's word will find you and bring you back and let me tell you there's a power that works beyond your own will because by your own will you could never do it but there comes a power that moves Upon Our will let me just say it like this a power to overthrow your own [Applause] will Lord so we have received an unreserved freedom and a change if I can say it this way of relationship status that has brought a complete trust in him that's what confidence is we've got a trust in him do you know how this is going I don't know how it's going to turn out but I trust him I don't need to know all the p's and q's I just need to know him when God came to Mary she said how shall this be and God said let me take those words of how or those letters and let me just give you the answer the answer is not how but the answer is who wh he took the same words of how the letters and he let her know it's not how it's the who he is the one who performs the promise I want you to look at this in the scriptures here of this boldness being exhibited here is Peter and them after the man was healed at the gate called Beautiful remember it was not Peter and and John that healed him they were instruments right right now remember this is the incident right here in Acts 4:13 where the Prophet tells us that got the devil stirred up and mad he told us that when the Holy Ghost fell this is what the prophet's words were he when the Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost Satan didn't even get out of his own bed but he said when the gate called Beautiful happened and took place he said Satan got out of his bed he said because the phenomena the supernatural was moving through surrendered vessels in life let me tell you the devil don't care how much that we could set and sit around and and what I have but you remember what God has given you remember the Holy Ghost is come to put you into Service as a son and daughter of God sanctification makes you ready for service but it is the holy ghost that put you into service to be a witness where God has called you to be a witness the Bible says when they saw the boldness of Peter and John and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men these guys the prophet said they couldn't even read their name on the side of a box car God don't need intellects that's right he don't need intellects God does it in such a way that it has to take knowledge that within this it's got to be something more than the intellects of man they marveled they took knowledge of him that they had been with Jesus that's the kind of testimony I want I don't want the testimony of oh uh he just been the bwt the Devil comes to BS WT you say how can you say that Hey listen you think Satan is excluded from the Gathering of Sons and Daughters of God when when the sons of God gathered there Job chapter 1 when the sons of God gathered Satan gathered up there too now don't go getting anybody in your mind I'm talking about the devil if your brother or sister Did You Wrong your brother sisters not the devil come on friends no more their wrong no more your attitude it's the devil that would like to get between woo they saw the boldness of Peter and John that's that where they noticed these men were speaking without any holds upon their life and going on and acts 4:29 when they had released them the Bible says when they went into prayer Lord behold their threatenings and Grant unto thy servants that with all boldness they may speak Thy word you see we could take lesson right here instead of getting on Facebook and Instagram and calling every one of our buddies and our friends and complaining about all of our problems and our situations and looking for somebody to be our helper somebody to lift me up let me tell you you have an open Mainline there is a connection to the throne of almighty God it is not closed off listen friends I'm not against calling somebody else but listen you got to make sure that you've got to walk with God that you've got to hold on God and God's got to hold on your life cuz nobody can replace the indwelling of the Holy Ghost in your life he said he wants to be your guide and your leader in your life H amen amen woo my a lot of fresh things Dro in here but that they may speak Thy Word with boldness by stretching forth hand to heal and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy Child Jesus and when they had prayed the place was shaken where they were assembled together and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and they spake the word of God with boldness you see that pattern they had just been filled with the Holy Ghost few days before that right so many times we live below our privileges we allow Our Lives to be filled with so many other things and then this is where our stand gets weak I'm preaching now right but you see when situations arise persecution was coming upon the church trials was coming upon the church that's not the time to pull away from God that's the time to say Lord Grant Lord the grace that I need Grant a refilling of the spirit of God that I might be able to stand and speak the word with boldness you know what youve got to do you've got to stand on your ground and say I'm not going to release any of this Crown no matter what test no matter what trial comes Satan is not getting one eye OD of ground that's standing there with a boldness listen friends it takes more than just something of us saying it it comes their strength for standing in boldness came with the refilling of the Holy Ghost watch Paul and for me this is what part of the prayer this is part of praying and he says and for me this is the praying that utterance may be given unto me that I may open my mouth boldly now remember we're not talking about that naturally some of us have problems with this naturally this is talking about spiritually oh we're very quick oh don't cross my path you need to let the Holy Ghost take a hold of your life if your buttons are that fragile you need to make sure you've got the main spring on the inside and yield to him you don't want to be known as a stick of dynamite that's ready to explode at any time Handle With Care come on friends oh that's just my makeup I thought we're Sons and Daughters of God are we going to claim that we're Sons and Daughters of God and then when the word's being P preached pulled back on it no we're going to stand with a real boldness and say Lord that's the mark that I'm to hit give me the grace that I need in my life that my life would match what the word is calling for oh my remember when the Lamb's wife was revealed it did not say it did not say the Lion's wife it said the Lamb's wife why submissive nature and through that submission it receives Divine authority of the lion operating through the lamb am notice this he says to make known The Mystery of the Gospel this is the purpose God I want this boldness for which I am an ambassador in bonds that therein I may speak boldly as I ought to speak I don't know about you but this is something to me when I read this this is the same thing as in Acts chapter 4 that there this is why the refreshing from the presence of God the renewing the washing of Water by the word this is why we need refilling of the Holy Spirit listen friends when we find yourself getting a little LAX when you find yourself giving away when you find listen to me now this is where it requires us to be very honest when you find yourself reasoning against the word of God or even allowing a voice to reason against it of what belongs to you this is where you need to come back to and say God granted Lord a fresh refilling that I might stand there with a boldness in other words I'm going to ask you the question are you living in the same Victory as when God got a hold of your life or has your boundaries been compromised come on friends we got to understand that if the boundaries themselves have been compromised it isn't God's fault it isn't that the devil is some big bad guy it's we let down and asking God Lord give me the boldness I need give me the strength I need to speak as I ought to speak right there's times before where you would have never compromised on being in the house of God there's times before the boss could have said we're going to do this and we're going to do that you never would have done that before now listen you can talk to me about the economy all you want to talk to me about the economy and if that's making you mad we'll stomp on your toes a little more you see friends look at it just look at it Satan is always there to hand out excuses we can then we can find dozens of excuses as to why we can't do this or we can't do that but the Bible says that my God shall supply all that I have need of are you with me now yes oh if I was so and so if I was so and so no God's called you and I to be who he's called us to be but this is where I'm trying to show you this is an access that we have to be able to stand here with a boldness by his Spirit Philippians 1 verse 19 20 Paul said for I know that this talking about this bondage he was in shall turn to my salvation through your prayer and the supply of the spirit of Jesus Christ according to my Earnest expectation and my hope that in nothing I shall be ashamed but with that with all boldness as always so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body whether it be by life or by death right now I want you to think of it these scriptures that I read to you right here it's started out remember when you look here there the scriptures all the way what what Isaiah saw Ezekiel Saw the same thing John saw the same thing in Revelations 4 he saw the four living creatures now what it comes down to these are characteristics of the spirit of God that would be that would be exhibited or shown through the seven Church ages that of the lion is started out there with those first three ages then it came the time of the ox now the lion started out with the courage but you know what the gospel never left a courage in other words it never became as though the gospel moved back and was no longer courageous no the spirit of God now moves in a place of a ox where it is the surrendering of Life on account of the word where they remember they called them up there in those times when when har the Roman Catholic church and all them they laid all of those great Martyrs down through time and remember they they called him up there and there were those who would stand there not just older not just middleaged even the young people that would stand there and told them recount take away if you recount we'll save you from this fire we'll save you from these Lions but you see they were under the anointing of the Holy Spirit as an ox to surrender their lives Hallelujah then we come here comes down to Luther Luther the sardian age then the Philadelphian age then the lady oan age under the man anointing the restoration of gifts ausa Street Pentecost was under the man anointing is that right it was under the man anointing God used the man Luther took the scriptures and then they had these N9 that's where he came up with the 99 thesis under inspiration of God where they were wanting to say that this is the literal body of Jesus Christ and this is the literal blood and Luther blew Luther threw it down and say that's nonsense that is not the truth that is error you know what it was the wisdom of man it was the spirit of God operating through the wisdom of man it was a time of reformation of reforming this is why we're living in the hour of the Flying Eagle amen are you hearing me we're living under the anointed this is the anointing of the spirit of God in this hour and that anointing of the Flying Eagle it lifts us from looking at things in an Earthly view if you're looking at things in an Earthly view you need to say God let my eyes be anointed let me be caught up Lord because when the eagle anointing is over your life then that's by the word when you see that you can see then the end you see your destiny you see things more clearly is everybody with me it's like that that little picture that we sent you out there where all of that was created for you to know how to come in here and the parking spaces that was not taken that picture was not taken from ground level that picture was taken from something above looking down you see this is why prayer is so important because you can look on eye level and you can accuse your brother or sister come on Friends the prophet said he said we can backslide he said on one another in the church he said we can backslide on Christ but we can't backslide on God because the blood of Jesus Christ stands between us and almighty God so others around can see that but this is why this is why the prophet said when you get caught up in prayer and you get there then you will begin to put yourself in the other person's shoes and giving them if I can say like we did on Thursday night a pass that's good and I'm not talking about a pass that's held over their head cuz that ain't forgiveness right that's fakeness right amen woo preach brother Samuel Hallelujah amen well I got plenty of scripture but I'm not going to go in all that but that's the word of God you know we want genuine forgiveness now notice this here on these four living creatures that's why the prophet said in this age he said they were under the inspiration of the spirit of God and the power of God how could a man do anything else beside the power of God that had been released to them he said that's the only thing when that Spirit certain Spirit was among them that's the only thing that they can work by is the spirit that's among them and the church will always respond to the anointing they can't do nothing else hallelujah hallelujah so so in other words when the spirit of God the word of God comes in this hour he promised when the enemy would come in like a flood that the spirit of God would raise a standard up against him the only way to meet the enemy in this hour it will never work under a man anointing that's right come on now it don't never work just on the the the the reintroduction of the nine spiritual gifts it will not defeat the enemy it's got to come under the Flying Eagle which is a prophetic word a word that puts all those things in position a word that lets you know where you come from you are in God's mind a word that brings stability in your life a word that lets you look beyond your situation and know I'm an overcomer I am I I am one of his I am redeemed and you're able to stand there as a son and daughter of God hallelujah every man that's ever met God every man that's ever met God upon these sacred Sands of God's grace there's an anointing that comes to anoint the faith that God has placed in him the prophet said it like this and why Christ speak Moses was born with these great qualities he had these great qualities of faith in in him he says again he says he was born with this equipment in him but when he comes into the presence of God that's when that Faith becomes anointed because before that time when opposition came Moses ran but when now by the presence of God it becomes not Moses Faith but it becomes God's faith operating through Moses life amen he's got an anchor he's got a stand that he is able to move by the Holy Spirit and is moved by by God look at Noah Noah is the same way when they came to Noah like we looked at last week and they remember the prophet tells us they they shot the instruments up there and said there ain't no moisture in the air there they didn't listen in the dictionary rain wasn't even a word that was not how the one that's not how the Earth was cared for as a matter of fact the Earth wasn't even tilled it it was atomic explosion that knocked it over right this is why when it when it comes back here under the Sons and Daughters of God it'll come back to its upright position you know why cuz the Earth is a redeemable attribute of God that's the same thing the Holy Spirit does to you and I it brings us back to our upright position in Christ is that right so notice it's the same way with Noah same way with Moses same way with David they trusted in the anointing that was upon their life I hope you understand what I'm saying they were not falsely anointed no balum was anointed that's right but he was a false prophet right he had the genu and anointing of the Holy Spirit but he did not have a heart that was lined in obedience to God balam did not have that what was needed on the inside to be able to become illuminated by the anointing of God and God was letting you and I see that even though gifts can come a dime a dozen Hey listen there's many many in hell that's right that they lended their gift to the devil Beatles on and on Michael Jackson we could go on and on Elvis presely one night singing gospel another night singing this you know why they do that you know why they've done that I've I've watched some documentaries you know why they're doing that because of the tormenting spirits and they're trying to appease that tormenting Spirit upon their life let me tell you right now this morning if you're here with a tormenting Spirit there is a place where that tormenting Spirit can be lifted off of your life and you can walk with the real freedom in your life and in your heart where you're not tormented with the Fashions of this world I've got to be in step with this world that's a Spirit and the Holy Ghost comes to break and loosen those Spirits oh my there ought have been a bigger Amen on that one it comes to loosen those holes amen they were able notice every one of them were able to stand in the face of adversity I'm talking about this boldness now David was able to stand there when his brothers had this so-called discernment of what they discerned was in his heart is that right he was able to stand there in the face of adversity gon bear Goliath he was able to stand there they were able to subdue kingdoms and because they were in their innermost they were surrendered to God right that's the real key right there I want you to notice this this is where we want it to come we want to be we want to stand with conviction that's what boldness is we're living in an age friends where nobody well I don't want to say nobody but for the majority don't have conviction look how much trash and immorality has entered in pull pits now let me just tell you that didn't come in just within the last year the reason that nonsense is in there is because the Holy Ghost was put out of those churches they got rid of the word of God and when you get rid of the word of God something's got to fill that place and I'll tell you what's filled that place I don't care how anointed they are it is Devils that has filled that place fallen angels that kept not their first estate I'm going to preach now it's the same way with trying to tamper with this message as though I'm going to figure this out and brother Brandon said this here brother Brandon said that here Anointed with a fallen angel because there are angels that kept their first estate and that first estate is staying with the word of God I'll tell you right now now I don't got time for nobody I don't have time for nobody that wants to try to Tamper around this message when you tell me it's brother Ram's opinion you have told me that I don't need to hear you no more flat plain simple good brother Samuel that offends me well you need to ask God to put some good Sav On it right there cuz that's where I stand I'm interested in a Rapture friends I'm not interested in church members I'm not interested in been patting you on the back Hallelujah come on now I'm not interested in my welfare I'm interested when I stand there on that day that there is no excuse that you have and say if you would only preached it a little harder if You' only been true to me if you'd only been honest with me It Might Sting now but it'll do us good if we'll let the word Lord let it sink into my heart I'm planning on standing there with you on that day we might have to walk through many fires we might have to come through many storms many times of praying for one another for God's grace but by the grace of almighty God this word that we have been given I have a boldness to say where it has swept the world out of my life taken me from the world it will sweep us all the way to glory amen praise the Lord get some conviction about your life quit letting quit letting the enemy buff you Buffalo you around come on friends I listen what I'm trying to tell you this is not mind over matter I'm trying to talk to you where this boldness comes from this is where we've got to be honest with God in evaluation of our own life to stand with the conviction this is why this is a picture of poly car but notice what Paul said like this watch ye Stand Fast in the faith quit you like men and be strong that's a big word cuz we're living in a society of sissies I'm talking not only gays but I'm talking about straight as well where they let the wife just you know lead them around and everything I'm not talking about a man being a dictator Christ is no dictator but his church don't tell him what to do because the church that tells him to do is not his bride it's an impostor come on that's what the Bible says in the Book of Revelation it said as I said as a queen I have need of nothing but God will judge her because she claims to be married to the word and she transgresses against the word amen hallelujah giving out this and this p and that that's not the kind of pastors we want we want the pass of the blood in our life we want to know that we met God and we have met the requirements through our Passover Christ Jesus Hallelujah quit you like men in other words be brave that's what this means stand with some conviction that don't mean you've got to be a bully but stand with some conviction it doesn't mean you've got you don't mean you've got to have a a big bous voice but have some conviction let me put it like this have a backbone come on friends I know I know that having a a real man that's a that's a rare thing in this hour y but I'll tell you what let me just say you this right now I'll just let me just speak to all the sisters a minute I have watched over at different times where times where I've had individuals come to me and when want to complain to me about their husbands sometimes it's not even sitting right here and I'm looking at it I'm thinking but you don't even come to the house of God faithfully and your husband is trying to make an effort to come to the house of God I'm going to preach now amen hallelujah my question is what are you doing yes you see everybody wants Jesus to fix everything and let us live the way we want to live you know there's a scripture for that the Bible said in Isaiah seven women shall take hold of one man but they let him know we will eat our own bread and we're going to wear the kind of clothes we want to wear but just let us be called by your name that's a prophecy of this you see you can't have the benefits of the life of the word if you don't come under the [Applause] word it amazes me you know with things the way that people want problems and they want oh the pastor as though the pastor when he's you know uh comes in his office and these magic wands and and this and that and everything else but you know what God isn't trusted you and I and you know what it is the greatest power and strength that we have is to surrender our own life with God I look at it like this with my boys and their stand for God that's God's grace in their life I'm thankful I'm thankful for these other young people I tell you as parents right here we ought to Rally right around that oh brother Samuel I'm going to send them everywhere I'm not talking about sending them everywhere I'm talking about in your life be a testimony be an example of the love of God right here right now it's don't put it off on somebody else or if we was only here if we was only with fa God is no respector persons is that right it's like I told the young people in one of the meeting did God make a mistake does God make mistakes they said NOP I said so did God make a mistake when he put you here right oh my God Don't Make Mistakes God Don't Make Mistakes we we you know what so many times we're running out here and ignoring God right Among Us amen praise the Lord I'm not talking about we don't have friends out there that's not what I'm saying don't misinterpret me but I'm talking about standing with conviction standing with a real conviction and under the anointing of the Holy Spirit and I think that's a part that even as as real Godly sisters that you would desire that for for your husband to be a real leader in the home Amen to be one who has caed together devotions you know what you know what brother Brown said concerning David's dad you know what he called him brother BR called him a great man of God and you know why he says that he said because he got his family together for devotions right so a great man of God don't have to be somebody that walks on the water right a great man of God just simply calling together Lord this word we want this word to be the influence in our life oh my to standing with conviction I'm not going to give up in the ground how about you I'm not going to give up any ground I don't want to take back any ground if there's anything at all if somebody takes a picture of you today if you have receded from where you were your backs lit I'm talking about in your heart and in your fervency but you know what there's a fix to that we're not without hope there's a fix to that if we'll be honest with God and say Lord I need a fresh refilling I don't know about you but you know this is unlimited refills this isn't the jokes like the rest pay cuz a matter of fact you you pay you know what is it I don't know 1025 for for a Coke it's kind of exaggerating a little bit who knows if it is Coke or not but you pay for it and then unlimited refills really you can get full on that pretty quick but think about this you don't it's not something that you have purchased God made available for you and I brother it's unlimited refills you don't got to wait till you get to the house of God to get a real dose and a refilling of the Holy Spirit just you have the opportunity to steal away with God and say Lord I need a fresh refilling of the Holy Spirit notice and and when you look at this of how that you know when you see how God would approach this with Joshua remember what God told Joshua he told him and admonished him to be strong and of a good courage why because as I was with Moses I will be with thee also be strong and very courageous God would speak of this over and over now I want you to think he spoke to him to be strong and courageous that he might observe to do all that is wrote in the law according to Moses now this very important because it's not just do according to all the law what you think the law says see we're living and we're we're kind of getting it seems like some of those things are starting to drift right back in among us but do the law according to what Moses has said in other words not our interpretation but what God has said through Moses let me just say this all the way through the church age book The Prophet lays it down clear the true evidence of the baptism of the Holy Ghost is to not only be able to hear the word but receive the word and walk in unity with that word that's the plum line where it has changed our very nature and there's an amen on the word when the word comes to correct us and the word shows us when we're wrong there's an amen on the inside that says so be it Lord so be it unto me Lord God why because you can't have the Holy Ghost without having the word in your life these three are one Hallelujah the Father the word and the spirit is that right so the real coming of the Holy Spirit the boldness it brings is a boldness by divine revelation to stand on the revealed word of the hour no matter how many websites and whatever more I hate to be standing in those guys shoes come on see God permitted all that stuff God permitted it we could try to say oh my we're going oh man if we could have just kept that down no God permitted it listen Paul remember there was some guys hus and valitus that they got out there and they started teaching certain things and the Bible said the faith of many were overthrown but it didn't Shake God one bit God let him know the foundation of God standeth assure and let me tell you when you're born of the spirit of God you're born of the word you are a part of the same Foundation that the apostles and the prophets are built on and there's no other Foundation but Jesus Christ the word hallelujah though the gates of hell is hell but yet this rock it will hold you it will keep you there is an anchor that holds you no matter what winds of Doctrine and confusion fly out there's a boldness to stay with the revealed word of the [Applause] hour so you want to know whether you have the Holy Ghost or not is your life yoke to the word is it Yol to the word in every way well well brother Samuel it all is but this and maybe my dress and maybe my this well then it's not yolked all the way you need to get yolked all the way yes Amen to recognize friends we didn't have nothing to do with this let me read you a little statement here oh my brother brm says this is all it's not mother is there it's not because she's there that I'm saved it's because God chose me in Christ not you choosing yourself not your choice how much you prayed when you turned a new page you had nothing to do with it amen you say you you mean that I didn't turn to the Lord no sir you had no way at all of turning to the Lord your whole nature your whole makeup was against God God called you it's always been that way see this is where our boldness begins to be built because if our boldness is well in one night I really CED tears at the altar one night I did this one night I did that I I'm not against crying tears that's not what I'm I'm saying you understand what I'm talking about now amen I I what what I'm trying to say is is that it wasn't you seeking for God it was God that came seeking for you cuz God wasn't lost we were lost that's right we were the ones help where you at I don't know where I'm at I know where you're at I know where you're at and I'm coming to get you listen you might be in a condition like I was I didn't know how to get out I didn't even know where do I even begin my life is so twisted up and in shambles and everything up brother Samuel you were a pastor's son what does that have to do with it that's I got out there in the influence it wouldn't matter if I have sat here on the Pew which I did I came to the house of God but I had to meet God for myself and thank God I had a mom and daddy that didn't look at me and say well he's going to church man everything's all right but they had met God in a personal way and they were living with a confidence in their life and said though the situation looks dark but I've Got Confidence in what the token did for me when the token comes upon him I'm holding it over him with a prayer he belongs to me when that takes effect it'll change his life like it changed my [Applause] life yes sir hallelujah hallelujah amen he would have been easier for for for many of us to get out to untangle fishing line than to untangle a mess in our lives but I'm glad God's grace comes down he said this is what I'm here for Lord you don't even know how to get this knot untangled no but I know what's needed to take care of it I'm I I I know how to untangle that life I know what lays beneath that life oh my this is where we want to be able to stand like Steven where the Bible says there is a boldness that moved upon his life where the Bible says that his face Shone like an angel now think about this the Bible tells us in the Book of Ecclesiastes that man's Wisdom like when man figures something out has an aha moment man you know you can tell it you can tell it you can also tell when somebody's coming in in a faker going to offer up a word salad or something like that you can tell you can tell right oh oh my goodness where are my notes at you can tell right but but you know how it is when there's a confidence when you've went in to a presentation I've had to give presentations when I was at work and other things for Grants and things to State and so forth and all those things there's a confidence that you have when you walk in there it's like a aha or there's a problem that comes up at home and you're trying to figure out how do I do this how do I do that how do I figure out this Plumbing how do I do this wiring how do I do this how do I do that and all of a sudden the aha moment right oh man it it has an effect on everything has an effect I mean your wife's cooking tastes good it might be a burnt offering but it tastes good because you've got the answer that's right that's right well I I I don't say things like that to be funny but you know brother bam says there's times he said you'll notice he says I'll say certain things in a certain way to make you laugh he said and then I'll say to get it right back on track right I know where I'm at in quotes I know where I'm at but I say it in this way that when that wisdom is dropped upon our life it doesn't matter what takes place man we've got the answer to this solution right I hope you're not looking for Solutions while you're sitting here in church like trying to figure out the electrical wiring diagram in your home I I trust you say Lord I just commit that to you now it might drop while you're right here I guarantee you one thing if my brother-in-law receives some sort of an inspiration about a program that he is writing or working on we'll all know it you might think he's in the spirit cuz he's sitting in here but it might just be because he's got an wisdom and inspiration about a problem I have drove him in the car before when he's R reading books and I have been with him at breakfast and other places and there is no places off limits when he received the certain partition of a code that he needs to actually write oh there it is it doesn't matter could scare everybody to death in the restaurant now that's just how he's made up that wisdom will drop that way now if that will happen within that of a natural man what will it do when that wisdom that comes from above that's full as James said of Mercy it's pure it's full of joy when that drops down into your life it's like the wisdom that drops into your life when all of a sudden you've been looking and you've been wondering and it drops into your life the revelation of Jesus Christ and you say I'm saved I'm free what is it you're not speaking something of an imagination but it was a thought of God that came by a word and has been deposited in your life and you watch it's not you changing your life but it's Christ it's Christ and the old leaves drop up and new leaves come on hallelujah oh my like brother Bram said he said I don't believe he said it was a an angel he said some great light that was there around Stephen he said what it was as he said a he was a messenger he said he was standing there with a boldness and a confidence cuz he knew what he was talking about ain't that blessing I think of right here we've got young people right here that could sit right there with theologians now I'm not for debating I'm not for debating the word's not to be debated you convince Somebody by debating then they'll be somebody smarter they'll be able to do this around we don't know God by debating right we know God by Revelation amen and Revelation is not something we can explain oh I can pivot it this way and I can pivot it this way I can pivot it this way but when you know God by divine revelation you could set right down think about it think about you you as young people could sit right down and there are individuals that are going to school right now to study and how to explain the Trinity good luck that's good you know what that TR you know what that Trinity Doctrine is it's a doctrine of devils you know what it is it's split God always he's in three persons that's called a schizophrenic by the way split personalities you know why Satan did that the prophet told us he told you that lie to make a heathen out of you is that right you know what the ultimate objective why he's done that and done that in the name instead of taking the real name of Jesus Christ but it's taken titles instead because he wants to move the objective from the relationship God above us God With Us God in us that it's the same God and you are a part of the mystery of God but in the evening time there shall be light in the evening time Hallelujah and there's a people who know their God there's a people who have experienced the Redeeming Grace of almighty God hallu you might say brother Samuel maybe it's a sister maybe brother Samuel I couldn't lick scripture to scripture to scripture to scripture but there is one thing that's what's important is what's anchored in your heart that you'll never be ashamed of the revelation of Jesus Christ I know in whom I have believed and I'm persuaded that he is able I know that it's not God broke down into three persons but I know it's God operating in three Divine attributes just like I am a son I'm a father I'm a husband but I'm the same person the whole time this is why it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever Jehovah of the old is Jesus of the new hallelujah amen in that same life that was in that sacrifice that came back on the day of Pentecost to get a hold of you and I and make the pardoning grace of God a reality in our lives amen hallelujah my M I feel good thank you Lord I'm getting somewhere now you said you weren't going to hold them first minutes against me but I've got to get it somewhere here there has to be you see for this boldness it requires a relationship status change now a lot of young people know this everybody you know this is like the going thing in and out in and out in and out in and out I'm relationship I'm really but I'm I'm talking about that I'm talking about where there's a relationship status change that comes in our lives in the Book of John you'll read how when the Lord Jesus he spoke to the to the disciples and he said I'm not going to call you servants any longer I'm going to call you friends what was it relationship status update then after the resurrection he said no longer going to call you friends why was he calling him friends he was going to make known no longer am I going to keep from you I'm going to make it known to you then after the resurrection he said I call you Brethren see the now what's being put before him the same access of all that God was in Christ amen hallelujah and all that all that Christ was he had poured into the church we are Brethren which lets us know we have a right to the same life am then the then the relationship status changes to sons of God being now fully manifested sons of God the whole time but they went from being servants friends Brethren to now manifested sons of God I'd say that's quite a relationship status update because when they came out of the upper room they went in there cowards hello they went in there cowards but when the Holy Ghost came it gave them a boldness to stand on the word though all Jerusalem and all around was against it but what happened the anointing of the spirit of God the lion of the tribe of Judah it entered in and they came out there it was a roaring out of what was in their [Applause] life oh my this is why in the latter part of this scripture I have to read this this is why that we're through this one offering there don't need to be another offering come again come on we're thinking about communion now I'm thinking about this boldness this relationship there doesn't have to come forth another offering for by one offering he has perfected ever them that are Sanctified this is why the revelation of Jesus Christ the spirit of God moving throughout the congregation is to sound the Jubilee trumpet to you to let you know know that he has paid the sin debt for you the trumpet sounds to your life conviction strikes our heart and a way becomes open what is it we're seeing Jesus Christ Our Passover Lamb we're seeing him the atonement we're seeing him the one the ransom for all sin he is My Kinsman hallu this is why in verse 19 having therefore Brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus in other words I'm not coming into this with I don't know if I'm not we we'll never be worthy he has made us worthy that's right that's right you see the boldness that I'm coming by is because like Esther when she was coming into the court when she came in there said I don't know I want y'all to be praying because if he don't hold out the scepter to me I'm dead but you see when she came in the court he had the scepter he held it out it was extended to her you know what that was a sign of that your request your approach feel free to approach the throne that's what this message is it reveals the king of glory let me preach now out in Sabino Canyon the prophet received the sword of the king in his hand it was a word that's been extended to you and I and the word is not against you but the word has come to cut away all unbelief and bring us to the rightful approach you you are his queen you are his bride you are his chosen approach the throne freely through the way that's been made for you what is it an entrance as Peter said has been ministered unto you into the Capstone my my my my my my my my my by a New and Living Way which he had consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh and having a high priest over the house of God let us draw near with a True Heart in full Assurance of Faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water the prophet said sprinkled there means shook away our conscience the sin problem evil and darkness shook off of it with our bodies washed with pure water through the water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ we can walk freely and boldly up to God knowing this are you with me the evil that I once loved has passed away that's good knowing that the life that I once lived is now ceased not because I did it because something come in me and did it itself by Grace he saved me I believed him he gave me the Holy Ghost the things that I once hated I now love the sacrifice it used to be hard for me to go to church I love to go now to hear the people sing and shout and testify used to hate it but I love it now something has changed in me then I have a New and Living Way something has anchored there Hallelujah you know why because you know what's happened in your life see that that's where the real shout and real Joy comes from it don't come because you know little little Aaron man he's all excited so I'm getting all excited no he he should be all excited because of the joy of the Lord that's striking his heart and when the joy the Lord strikes your heart you will be excited and joyful in the way that God has made you you might get a little bit beside yourself you might get a little bit so far out of your order or out of somebody else's order but you have got your soul and realized I have come back into the divine order of God there is peace with God there is an unreserved in my life that's right you see friends what this word is doing it's to liberate you when we talk about the ministering of the evidence of the Holy Ghost why do you think when you read every single age Church age through the church age book that's a separate subject I love to tackle one of these days on that book because there's been a lot of false things said against that that I could go to task on that you know why a lot of that's been said because it troubles their doctrines the prophet claimed that book as his own book yes he once again I'm not interested in tampering with the word am but there's a lot of stories I could give on oh no we don't do that it might help you out and get you straightened out cuz the prophet said I put my Doctrine right in there come on don't let a man put a scarecrow over you just because he a scarecrow is not for Eagles it's for [Applause] Crows Hall brother Samy you're speaking that pretty boldly I know where I'm standing amen I know where I'm standing Hall I'm not up here to cheerlead and pump you up I know where I'm standing on the word of God I've sat at many a table or I've had men sit right across from me and want to challenge on that book but God gives Grace we can go right down the line on so many other things you don't eventually says well this is just where we stand I'll tell you God helped me to never have that kind of an attitude where I cannot bow to the word of God when it's presented to me come on Friends not because of me but because of God's word this is where God's bringing us away from the traditions of man checking to see can I listen to this song let me go see what so and so says if they're your Holy Ghost then maybe you need to go ask them oh if I can read this book If there your absolute and your Holy Ghost then maybe you do but if you ever get the Holy Ghost in the absolute of your soul there is a holy ghost on the inside where your heart has become the Judgment seat of Christ and if there's something that's not right it'll re in your heart and let you know Hallelujah and if it's sin and everything else in the world and it don't bother you to read it and listen to it then you need to check what kind of spirit's in you because what can feed on that shows it's got some G on the inside and a dove don't have G Hallelujah now look at this relationship status and this change now you're a message believer you know that the prophet of God he didn't start on this in the seals this is all the way back in the early parts of the message he'll refer to this but he really lays it in real strong in God hidden in Simplicity on the opening of the seals because you see when you think of it that there was nothing that could bring man back into the relationship that God intended for him to have it would take and could only come through R him by the blood of Jesus Christ it would take God coming down and becoming one of us to shed his blood for you and I brother Bram was asked the question in one place what about one as it says in the scriptures if one was born you know out of out of wedlock and this and that is that possible for them to enter in you know to the congregation and brother Bram just simply answers that he says you know as as they couldn't enter in till generation many many many many generations later but brother BR said the reason that couldn't be is because there wasn't nothing strong enough to take care of that sin you know why God allowed that to be concluded because it showed that there was nothing the blood of bulls and goats could only cover a problem that was there so good are you with me the problem was still there it could only cover it it couldn't remit it or get get rid of it the blood of bulls and goats couldn't do that is that right no but notice that within this when this blood is come it has the strength within it to undo that condition in that life it has the power to be able to loosen us from sin the blood of Jesus Christ is strong enough now every one of us you know brother br allude this to where like if it's a drop of ink yeah you know and he said that drop of ink when it gets dropped in Bleach there's chemicals in that bleach that begin to deal with the compounds that have come together to make that ink and the bleach dismantles that drop of ink and bringing it back to its original form right now listen it's just like when you've had stains every every one of us have had stains I for myself personally I Don't Wear Ties I don't trust myself wearing ties and eating I I don't even really like to I don't like drink coffee with a tie on I'm I'm just that's just me I'm I'm afraid of it of doing it that way but every one of us have had stains on clothes yes right I know for me usually I'm asking I look at my wife honey was this going to come out honey is this yeah yeah yeah it's going to come out it's going to come out you know we've got oxy we've got shout we've got all these other things that are stain removers and you know I got to looking in on this right here of those stain removers and clock she's got to doing just a study on that of how when the prophet would tell us that When sin is confessed it is dropped in the bleach of almighty God the blood of Jesus Christ and you realize what those stain removers bleach and all those other things every one of them there's almost like four different four different areas of how that they'll work because a lot of times a stain what's really incredible is that a stain itself some of you probably think man I'm getting educated on stain removal no stay with me now because you see within it a lot of times within a stain there are multiple Parts within that stain that compounds that needs to be dealt with and this is why then when you have that of that bleach or that stain remover it is there to deal with all of that mixture let me tell you friends we just weren't didn't have well I need this one area fixed I need this one area fixed I need just this thing fixed we needed something that could take care of the full sin question and the blood of Jesus Christ let me tell you what it does it comes in and it breaks down sends hold When sin is confessed and when I got the studying on this you know what stain removers do I'll tell you what they do the stain removers it says that well you know it's like the food that you when you eat it's like digested and broken down in your body there are enzymes in stain removers that can break down the proteins in in the stains into smaller chunks I wish I had more time to preach on this you see when the blood of Jesus Christ begins to be ministered into your life and begins to bring conviction it can look you can take a problem that seems like a great big stain but in the presence of Jesus Christ man get it underneath the blood and what seems so big it begins to smaller chunks it begins to be broken apart all the AR arguments and all the accusations that the enemy is want to put upon your life begins to be dismantled through the blood of Jesus Christ and let me just tell you the blood of Jesus Christ isn't something that I'm looking back that I got to go over to Israel and try to excavate something that's in the earth remember the chemicals the literal physical chemicals have broke down and went right down in the ground but the life that was within that blood has come back and it's that life itself that is the voice of the blood that speaks better things it's that voice that calls you and I and says to you and I come home hallu it deals the stain remover deals with the enzymes it breaks it into fragments so it can be washed away that's right it dismantles sin's hold oh don't you love the Lord yes see this is why friends listen now this is why that within it when we look at of the blood being applied everybody all right amen I'm getting there I'm getting there this is why when we look at the blood being applied hey I don't want to stop this would be like stopping and not serving dessert I know I could always break it up but I I don't when we're in the middle of a throne right here I'm just let me get to this point this is where it's got to come a thorough repentance not a repentance of sorry of the condition we're in but you know what real repentance is it's just like when like brother BR says like this he says if I was to say something to my wife he said and it wouldn't be right he said in my heart I would feel sorry he said right there I'm forgiven but I have to tell her I'm sorry that's part of repentance and he said that's the same way it is with God see thorough repentance begins in the heart everybody with me now it begins in the heart to where the conviction of the holy spirit let me just tell you this right here let's put the devil on notice oh brother Samuel I feel judged well I hope the word does judge you I hope it judges every one of us and I hope if we're not right I hope this conviction power of God so strikes our hearts into such a place that we'll come into such humility and say Lord I want to be right that's what kind that's a conviction we want you we want God to stand that way don't we we want him to stand that way he is standing in this hour is that right so repentance it comes from the inside out this is why with so many times where it's missed we think of repentance as just well I'm just saying that I'm sorry but it begins with that real true abor this is scriptural of what's been done you recognize Lord forgive me Lord Jesus I don't want me many you whether you've come to the altar maybe it was out you know when you were in your bedroom or something like that maybe you out driving your car I don't know where the spirit of God would begin to deal with your life and finally it comes that place of Lord forgive me it's got to start somewhere but see it begins with God dealing with your heart I remember how God dealt with my heart God was dealing with my heart long before I it ever echoed out of here God was dealing with my life there was things roadblocks almost got my life taken away in the flats right before God got a hold of my life I tell you what it was the mercy of God that God was already dealing my life showing me things that hey this and this and this and this but you know what it had to be God come and finally it came to that place where that really settled into My Heart Lord forgive me H did you know how I I didn't know Lord I I don't know I've tried I've tried before I've tried but forgive me for Where I Am Lord I don't want to I don't want to do this no more I want to serve you but I don't know how I I don't know how Lord I I can't find the strength I don't know how I don't know how Lord but I need you Lord forgive me it started in here but it came out here because you know why I tried before but that's always the that's always the error us trying see Satan wants to put it that's your effort it's not your effort I'm not here because of Samuel Browning's effort I'm here because of his grace you're here because of his grace I didn't quit doing this and quit doing that but he became lifted up before me that Lord I don't want to do anything Lord that displeases you hallu it's from the inside out that's that's real repentance that's where the blood becomes applied in our lives you know where that comes down it comes down just like it was with Moses when he stood there and he came to that place in Exodus 14 the enemy and the taskmasters were behind him and Moses said stand still and see the salvation of the Lord he spoke with an unreserved courage and when he spoke and god notice what God he turns back around and God says don't cry to me speak that the people go forward hold out that judgment Rod over those Waters he held that judgment Rod out over there you know what that was a type of it was a type of the name of Jesus Christ and the deity of God's own life in it and those Waters parted and Moses told him the Egyptians that you see today you ain't going to see them no more God Made A Way on dry ground they weren't walking like out here when it rains this ground is squishy mushy maybe in some of your yards it's that way the Bible said that East Wind came and made a dry ground let me tell you if God is requiring you to walk through his word he's able to give you the strength to stand on Solid Ground cuz every pathway that the word makes for you it's Solid Ground and Moses let him know that the Egyptians you saw today this is the last when they got over on the other side than the Egyptians they tried to come that same way but they weren't ordained to come that way and the water just closed right you know what that was a type of don't you that was a type of the blood of Jesus Christ the Red Sea it was showing you and I that the things that once hounded you and wanted to bring you back in bondage if you'll ever come God's provided way God will take care of every habit he'll take care of every situation he'll take care of everything that's there to where there's never a Taskmaster to come back over your life and say aha I've got you again the blood of Jesus Christ is there to handle and take care of sin and so with that in mind update relationship status changed because I know a lot of people like that status changed I wonder who it is my mom or if it's a daughter my dad that's who it is but an update a Rel relationship see this is what brings boldness see men and women can speak boldly Maybe by their Seminary teachings their teachings they've went through but that's not the boldness that comes from God we're talking about a boldness that will stand upon God's word regardless a boldness that will stand there and humble themselves to the word word of God no matter what yes amen this is where Paul could could bring us to this place and say the life that I now live I love the scripture I now live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me don't you love him let me look look at what this Faith does here I'm closing brother Bram says oh look read with me and bold God that they would be so filled with your spirit that they'll have faith to perform miracles Faith to live a Godly life to live a life so sweet that when they are spoke evil of they speak not back evil that's faith that they can return a kiss for a slap that they can return good for evil granted Lord make men to be humble make men to come to know you in the power of your Resurrection May your death not be in vain to us in this generation let me just move ahead here it brings us to this place where the love of God produces a real genuine faith in our life a confidence because a confidence is is a trust how many know I'm talking about a trust you got a situation maybe there's a physical need that's come up and we're praying for it and and the whole thing about it is is it's not us that tells God how right it's going to happen it it's not us that does that well my faith no remember healing healing is of god brother Bram said whatever Avenue it comes through right it's all of God is that right I know sometimes we you know I know sometimes we there's certain things we don't want to go through I get it I I I understand that maybe I haven't been through what you but I I know I know inconveniences I also know it's not just inconvenience I I hear that with things you know from my dad and where he was I I don't know it much myself maybe personally but I I've been there with those things as far as to hear it I I I have empathy not a sympathy that I could say I've been there so I'll be real on that but it's not as though it's us that makes that determination but I'll tell you this we're standing on God's word where it says they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover is that right whether it's by medicine whether it's by surgery whether it God just there's a miracle that takes place in that one or it's a miracle just drops down and it's gone from our body however brother BR says God performs Miracles through surgeries yes I there's a lot within it you know it stabilizes us to let us see within that but the love of God is what brings us confidence to where when I don't know how it's all going to work out I've got to trust in him how many know what I'm talking about on that say trust I don't know I don't understand I'm just trusting you Lord see how did that how is that confidence by the faith of him him cuz it's actually a Marvel and a miracle to you that how you can have such a confidence remember you didn't give yourself that confidence it's because of him it's his faith moving in your life it's supernatural than Lord I don't know about you but that that to me is I rejoice in that quite a bit but here's where it comes over the love of God that we may have herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world there is no fear in love I'm not afraid of oh I'm afraid I'll backslide I'm afraid no let let God drive that out of your life let let let listen go back to that first verse let the love be made perfect amen that's let it be made complete that's good because fear has torment sickness all the other things it has tor torment things that torment right and that's all satan That's what Satan even likes to do if he can try to get between you and somebody else and get something in your life and even even put you in a trap and then you know what he'll do when that trap that that that he has set and you have fallen in then if you can recognize it there is one here to break the hold of that trap are you hearing me this morning I I know I'm gone a little longer but there's one to break that trap because that trap produces a torment around your life but there's a spirit of God to come and break that what do I have to do confess your sins don't make it don't don't make listen friends don't make excuses for sin well because I was a little boy back here or because so no that's not repentance repentance is I'm owning my actions by the influence I came under and it ain't the influence of somebody else it's the what allowed the enemy to influence me are you with me oh come on this is where the love of God comes into our hearts I want you to think of this as we come to to the communion before we take it I want to read this this quote to you brother Bram says you don't take the Lord's Supper as we would come here in a few moments we don't take the Lord's Supper by a tradition in other words well that's just what we do right we don't do it that way you take it because it's the love of God in your heart in keeping the Commandments of God that's what you take it for so if you don't take it in sincerity and it's just a tradition well our church observes communion once every Sunday or once every month or twice a year and you go up and say well it's my time and then take the communion then it's a stinct to God it's just a tradition even like anything else you've got to be sincere God wants the depth of your heart you remember the very God that brought you here on Earth is the one you're serving you're doing this because he said so because it's his order then we want to come up with the deepest sincerity knowing that by God's grace that we have been saved we love him we feel his presence and we see it change our Our lives our whole being is changed we're different people we don't live like we used to we don't think like we used to that's how we come to take communion we're thankful for what the God God's Grace has done in our life because this communion what it speaks of is I am a partaker of the word and the spirit my life with the word and the spirit I am I am a partaker except you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you I am a partaker of his life amen my sins are confessed and under the blood my life is hidden with God is hidden with Christ in God that that's where I'm standing I'm standing with him and that's why when we come we come to take this we we hear we do it a few times out of the year but when we come I you know and and I say this because I know we're living living in a a community all around it's such a um such a highly uh um heavily populated Catholic community and it it it's almost like coming out of Catholicism and then wanting to bring that that tradition over to here as though I have to do this if I don't if I don't do this then I'm not saved this is showing that you have fellowship with God right the Bible says we'll read in a few minutes you do this in remembrance of me right and that remembrance is where I just read to you at the end of what he did for me he is my way maker I have seen him come and change my life yes sir and you know we can Fellowship on this because many of us God changed our life and then he has to then he comes back around and makes known to us what he already did and we we could have been looking for this and looking for this to happen I had to have this happen that I feel this or did I do this and God comes right back around and he brings it and he what does he do positions us on his word this is what I've already done in your life and it's discerned you discern it by the word because that's your Solid Ground that's where you stand with boldness because if it's by feelings you can feel a different way tomorrow right feelings can go that's why our boldness tomorrow is not based on our feelings our boldness is based on I know where I stand with God I know that I have met God's requirements I know what he's done in my life and I know what he's doing in my life and the enemy can sit there and say yeah but you made a mistake last week but that has been confessed amen I'm not making no excuse for it it has been confessed because the Judgment seat of Christ has moved into my heart and my sins are taken daily is that right you love him my my I know I've been a little longer but hey sometimes we set a little bit longer at other events that offer no spiritual value whatsoever I'm not trying to condemn you I'm just trying to let you know that there's things within this this is the greatest value of our life and if this right here it'll give us a strength it'll give us a conviction you know it'll give you a conviction even when it comes to your family it'll give you conviction to where you won't allow the devil to put you in a corner and say well this is just my child this is just our children this is my no it gives you a conviction it'll give you wisdom listen it will not make you a dictator but it will give you the wisdom of God not to back up on the message of the hour that God will give you the wisdom on how to apply it everybody hear what I'm saying it gives you the wisdom and this is why looking to God there are many times Noah had to know how do I cut this board there's things in your life that you need to know and say God how do how do I shake this board how do I do this how do I do that you what it is there's a desire in your heart to see the word applied and you're looking for the wisdom of God to drop down in your life to where you're a able to stand there with a real courage and when you stand with a real courage it's covered with love and there's an atmosphere that's created like the prophet said that they fall right into that atmosphere you love him oh my my my my let's just let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer my my maybe as we go to prayer here this morning do anyone want to be remember Remembered in prayer maybe someone you've got a need you've got a request on your heart maybe there's something there maybe it's something in your life something that you're looking to God for and you say Lord just I need you Lord just stay listen friend Stay Stay persistent with the promise that God has made you don't allow the devil to to back anything up from you maybe you look at in your life you say well I brother Samu I know that maybe I'm not where I ought to be well it's good that you know that but allow the spirit of God just say Lord take me where I need to be Lord take me where I need to be Lord let your will come Lord override my will Lord Jesus Lord God I I there's not a doubt in my heart as far as I know the promis for me I know what belongs to me Lord maybe there's something that in your life as we get ready to pray that maybe something you needed to just you needed to make right and you want to confess all all let everything be placed under the blood if you you intend to stand here and take the communion this morning maybe you just want to say Lord I want to just settle all that right now amen Heavenly Father Lord as we just come before your presence here this morning Lord You've spoken you've ministered to our hearts Lord I pray Heavenly Father Lord knowing that it's it's your desire that it would be Lord God our hearts and our lives every one of us not just a pastor not just a prophet not just someone else but every one of us individually from young people to middleaged to older to be able to stand Lord with a real conviction in our hearts Lord Lord I pray may you grant Grace to every hand that was lifted up Lord Lord to every life or no doubt Lord there's hearts and lives I'm sure that in this gathering this morning that would say Lord I want a deeper Walk with You Lord I want to move deeper Lord you feel the conviction of the Holy Spirit just moving around your heart there's a deeper walk there's more of God for you Lord I pray that you would just minister right now Lord to that life and to every heart Lord Jesus May there come forth Lord such a confession Lord where that sin would be so broken up by the blood of Jesus Christ Lord it's not something that's hard or complex it's simply a thorough your Prophet called it a thorough repentance completely Letting Go Lord now father that's not just Lord for one who would be coming home as a sinner but that goes Lord for every one of us Lord when we have fallen in some area something Lord that maybe we've said or we've done maybe it's something Lord as the spirit of God has dealt with our hearts like you so moved Among Us on Thursday night Lord and would speak so deeply to our lives because Lord your desire is that we would walk with a real boldness through the access and that confidence by the faith of God Lord help us may you Lord I pray just move down lord right now your presence Lord right Among Us and Lord as we would prepare to enter in Lord to take of the Lord's Supper I pray that God that as each one Lord that would prepare Lord to come and father as we would take of this Lord I pray that our hearts Lord just being searched out before you really lord it's something that something Lord that in our lives that is to look upon daily because we never know Lord we do not know the day nor the hour your Prophet told us it's always the time to check up Lord check up that's what we want to do Lord I pray pray father that may you just Lord Jesus just move right now by your presence Lord those that are sick Lord some that are here some that are not able to be here may your presence just move right down lord I pray right now dear God I believe with all of my heart father there was a young man that had been refused communion and he had Lord developed tuberculosis your Prophet was led by the spirit of God to go and take him communion and the prophet tells us he was refused it as a young man and tuberculosis developed in his body but he went there and he ministered communion to that boy Lord Jesus the Same Angel of the Lord that came to Peter in that prison that night the same Angel of the Lord healed that young man completely and he walked out of that iron lung Lord here today we don't hear too much about tuberculosis but back then it was like a death sentence Lord God when we read back in the Passover that was taken when they that was the last meal that they ate before they left Egypt Lord you kept every one of them alive you kept them you watched over them Lord you healed them you touched them Lord the Bible said there the threads of their clothes or their shoes never wore out oh God I pray granted Lord we know that that was speaking Lord of that real communion that we have with you Lord father where your presence comes down Our Lives has changed the experience of God in our life never wears out Lord help us Lord to pray we commit Lord this moment this time this service into your hands Lord for every need Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen would you stand with me and let's read 1 Corinthians 11 1 Corinthians 11:23 maybe Brianna maybe you can bring that up verse 23 of 1 Corinthians [Music] 11 Paul said for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he broke it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me and after the same manner also he took the cup when he had s saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do you as of as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do sh the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup what a privilege friends what a privilege to be able to examine our own lives I don't know about you I I want to be judged by the word I I want to be judged I want to be judged I want my life you know why right now if there's a Purgatory which the only real Purgatory there is is what's happening right now to allow the word of God to purge sin out of our life allow the word to wash away sin and all unbelief to be able to examine Our Lives verse 29 for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body that's just someone just living any old kind of life not taking into account of anything but we want to discern the Lord's body who is the Lord's body look around look around this is the Lord's Body by his spirit for this cause many are SI weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brother when you come together to eat carry one for another I just say it like this I love you all if there's something I've said if it's the word I'll stand on the word but if there's anything I've done to offend any of you outside of that forgive me I don't say that lightly if you feel I have done wrong then you owe it to come to me and sit down with me over the word but for one another we're a body we're a body God don't want divisions he don't want schisms in the body this is why even in this moment such a sacred moment to remember this started out as one bread the brothers and I stood there in the back and we took of that bread and begin to break it because he was broken for you and [Music] I but you know what we're one bread we're one body even though this right here we've got a tray of many different cups but it came out of one one on the day of Pentecost there were 120 vessels but it came out of one one is that [Music] right The Same Spirit what a privilege it is to me what a privilege it is to be able to take communion together foot washing what a privilege that I believe one of these days we're going to walk down the streets of gold together Hall the toils of this road will seem nothing when we get to the end of the way it'll be worth it all amen Brothers brother Gomez Brother Richard if you come um yeah maybe brother Aaron Brother Shane maybe if you can help out if anyone if if you don't want to if you didn't want to take communion you're welcome to slip out right now we're going to we're going to pray over the bread and over the wine and maybe just slip out quietly if and then brother Shane and brother Aaron if you'll just kind of help guide guide we want we want everyone to start come around this way and come through you know how we do it so Heavenly Father Lord is my brothers stand here Lord God with this bread Lord in representation of your body Lord Jesus where you came down and become one of us the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us where you could say that Moses gave you not that bread from Heaven yet the Mana came down from heaven but it was only a type a shadow of that true bread that was to come and that true bread is you Lord Jesus you are the staff of Life Lord You're the lifegiver Lord Jesus you laid down your life Lord for us Lord you were willing Lord God to drink the bitter cup to go to Calvary you paid the sin debt for the entirety of the world past present and future sin and father as this cup Lord David would refer to it by inspiration in the Psalms as the cup of Salvation a cup Lord God which is you would say this is my blood Lord how that the wine itself would be representative grape juice would not be fit but Lord I Thank Lord God as we open that back there in the office and the brothers begin to F these little vessels full of wine that wine Lord the strength of that smell coming off there Lord it it's strong but Lord it speaks of the strength of the blood of Jesus Christ that no matter matter how we stand here in 2024 the blood as we Sayang has never lost its power and you sent Lord an evening time message to reveal the way back to the blood back to our inheritance and inside Lord this blood it's representative as wine would produce a stimulation it's an intoxication Lord Jesus when the blood of Jesus Christ has been applied when we have repented of our sins and been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ down Comes The Gift of the Holy Ghost the new wine is poured in to new vessels Lord God it affects us and it has in our everyday life it affects us
