[3:03] it's gonna it's coming out of month now
[3:05] it's just been a very difficult month I
[3:07] urge all you married people hug your
[3:11] spouse everyday because you just don't
[3:12] know and you know losing a spouse is a
[3:16] pain that I can't describe to you it's
[3:19] nothing like losing a parent you know
[3:21] when you lose a parent you have your
[3:24] partner to go home to and bounce off of
[3:26] when you lose a spouse you had spouse
[3:28] you have an empty house to go home to I
[3:30] made a couple notes cuz I don't want to
[3:32] forget anything you'll never know how
[3:36] much sister Betsy loved you all I
[3:38] remember a couple days before she passed
[3:40] away we were driving in the car and she
[3:43] looked over at me and she said honey do
[3:45] you realize how lucky we are out of all
[3:47] the people in this world you know God
[3:49] brought us to this church and this
[3:51] people you ladies you'll just never know
[3:54] how much she loved you I remember every
[3:56] time she would organize one of those
[3:58] breakfasts two months ahead of time
[4:00] she'd have lists her her bed looked like
[4:03] a control panel or
[4:04] something she she had calendars laying
[4:07] she'd have list she'd revised the list
[4:09] and that was just her heart you know she
[4:12] just wanted to make all those just such
[4:14] a success and then I just thank you all
[4:18] for your prayers keep praying for me the
[4:20] phone calls are wonderful you know it's
[4:22] it you lose someone you just reach out
[4:24] to people you know half I'm like two
[4:27] persons now the spiritual side of me
[4:30] knows how much she prayed I mean she was
[4:32] in pain the last two years and would
[4:34] never let anyone and anyone know but she
[4:36] just prayed Lord take me I want to go
[4:38] home so I know for a fact spiritually
[4:41] how happy she is yet this human body
[4:44] just longs for her and I can't get away
[4:47] from that but I know I don't know how
[4:50] atheists exist if I didn't believe in
[4:52] God I don't know how they would get
[4:54] through the day when someone closed eyes
[4:56] you know but with the hope we have in
[4:58] God and hating again it's just such a
[5:01] wonderful thing and I just

[43:33] [Applause]
[43:38] haloo hey man what a precious promise
[43:44] you know I think of it many times that
[43:48] down through the time Paul spoke of this
[43:53] it was already in God's mind and Paul
[43:56] spoke of it and they have waited on this
[43:59] for the ages
[44:00] they have preached that we're living in
[44:03] the day where it's not just going to be
[44:07] preached
[44:08] that's prophecy it's coming to pass it's
[44:17] you know I stand I think about it many
[44:20] times where we're standing and you know
[44:23] you you pinch yourself sometimes you
[44:25] think Lord you know you look at how that
[44:29] but the venom says if I could have
[44:33] chosen any time to live I would have
[44:37] chose this time and we know this I've
[44:41] said this many times and perhaps you
[44:43] have - it certainly isn't because of the
[44:45] condition of the world not at all but
[44:50] it's because of God and what he's doing
[44:54] through his word I'll tell your friends
[44:57] if it wasn't for that we would not be
[45:00] able to stand in this world but it's God
[45:04] Himself who made a promise that when the
[45:06] enemy comes in like a flood I the Lord
[45:09] will raise the standard against
[45:12] amen how we thank God for His mercy
[45:15] don't you Amen let's stand and we want
[45:20] to go right into word this morning I
[45:27] know they gave the announcement already
[45:29] I want you to go to Exodus 17 if you
[45:32] would please
[45:32] they gave the announcement already this
[45:35] morning about the prayer meeting this
[45:38] coming Tuesday and we're just going to
[45:46] postpone that till the following Tuesday
[45:48] we'll get a memo out about that make
[45:51] sure we remind you but they're coming in
[45:53] tomorrow for the carpet and everything
[45:55] to lay all that over a couple days
[45:57] period of time and so finally have that
[46:01] arranged so let's just remember remember
[46:04] that the prayer meeting there will move
[46:07] that to the September 26th and we also
[46:10] need strong young men we've got a couple
[46:15] pews that need to get put in here after
[46:17] the service
[46:19] nobody said amen
[46:22] not just young men we need strong I will
[46:28] call no names I'd also like to meet with
[46:33] the brothers right after the service as
[46:34] well as well so also we sent out an
[46:42] email I think it was last week and it
[46:45] involves you have some upcoming dates in
[46:48] there and I apologize that that didn't
[46:51] wasn't getting out to you over the time
[46:54] of the summer I know many of you you've
[46:57] kind of make plans and preparations
[46:59] based on some of those things and just
[47:01] try to keep you abreast of things so
[47:03] that you're able to make plans and so
[47:06] forth I'm not the greatest and
[47:08] remembering to make announcements here
[47:10] these papers that I have I've had to
[47:12] stick them so that right on top my notes
[47:15] because if they don't go on top my notes
[47:17] we forget about it and so I have to put
[47:21] them right here in front of it and we
[47:22] try to get those out and just to make
[47:24] you aware of that even in October as
[47:26] well as in November where we have some
[47:29] things that are coming up as well
[47:31] special events if you don't happen to
[47:33] get the email we can get that printed
[47:35] off for you just see sister Rosanna see
[47:39] sister Michelle they can get all that
[47:41] printed off for you if you happen to
[47:43] need it to post it so let's read here in
[47:48] the word you hungry this morning
[47:51] amen Exodus 17 verse 8
[47:59] then came a Mallick and fought with
[48:02] israel and referee and moses said unto
[48:06] joshua choose us out men and go out and
[48:11] fight with Emily
[48:14] tomorrow I will stand on the top of the
[48:17] hill with the rod of God in my hand I
[48:23] want you to catch that you're not just
[48:26] gonna stand there empty-handed but he's
[48:28] standing with the rod of God in his hand
[48:32] not down in the valley he's gonna stand
[48:35] on the hill they're gonna fight in the
[48:38] valley but he's gonna be on the hill
[48:40] they're gonna be in a place where
[48:42] they're gonna be in battle but he's
[48:43] gonna be visible before him so Joshua
[48:49] did as Moses had said to him fought with
[48:52] Hamrlik and Moses Aaron and Hur went up
[48:56] to the top of the hill and it came to
[48:58] pass when Moses held up his hand that he
[49:02] is real prevailed and when he let down
[49:04] his hand Amalek prevailed
[49:06] you see that parallel when the hand is
[49:10] let down with the rod of God then Amalek
[49:14] prevails but when the hand with the rod
[49:17] of God in it is lifted amen when it's
[49:22] let down Israel is being defeated but
[49:24] when it's lift the Israel is prevailing
[49:29] and Moses hands were heavy that's a
[49:37] reality isn't it
[49:39] Jesus never said that the walk of a
[49:42] Christian would be easy
[49:44] he never said go take up your fruit
[49:47] basket and follow after me but he said
[49:51] take up your cross not my cross he had
[49:56] his cross but you take up your cross and
[50:00] sometimes he gets heavy but this is the
[50:04] next part and they took a stone and put
[50:07] it under him and he sat there on there's
[50:10] a place where you can rest on when it
[50:14] gets heavy there God has a place of rest
[50:16] it didn't just happen and say hey hey
[50:19] can y'all bring a stone up here no there
[50:20] was a place already provided like when
[50:24] Moses was having you know the time and
[50:27] and the Lord said here's a place beside
[50:29] me Moses come stand beside me so it took
[50:34] a stone and put it under him and he set
[50:36] thereon and Aaron and her stayed up his
[50:39] hands the one on the one side and the
[50:42] one on the other side and his hands were
[50:46] steady until the going down of the Sun
[50:52] so there was somebody there to keep his
[50:54] hands up somebody was there to keep the
[50:57] route of God up in the air the Amen
[51:01] hallelujah
[51:02] Joshua discomforted emilich and his
[51:05] people with the edge of the sword and
[51:07] the Lord said unto Moses write this for
[51:10] a memorial in a book and rehearse it in
[51:13] the years of Joshua but I will utterly
[51:16] put out the remembrance of Amalek from
[51:19] under heaven and Moses built an altar
[51:21] and called the name of it Jehovah Nissi
[51:23] where he said because the Lord has sworn
[51:26] that the Lord will have war with Emily
[51:29] from generation to generation amen
[51:33] let's just look to the Lord in the word
[51:36] of Prayer
[51:38] precious Heavenly Father Lord we want to
[51:42] say that we we love you more we would
[51:46] just ask the Lord that here father in
[51:48] the midst of the time as we are Lord
[51:51] giving ourselves Lord to the Word of God
[51:54] Lord we ask the Lord that your precious
[51:57] Holy Spirit Lord father you who are the
[52:00] word yourself that you will come Lord
[52:03] and all God guide and direct us Lord
[52:07] father in your word this morning that
[52:10] Lord it is not just something that we
[52:12] see but father you show us how that we
[52:16] might apply it Lord in our lives Oh God
[52:19] so we ask the Lord in all things that
[52:21] you'll be glorified Oh God
[52:23] we pray this morning Lord God that once
[52:26] again Lord as according to your word may
[52:29] Amalek be discomforted Lord God father
[52:32] by the edge of the sword Lord we pray as
[52:35] the hands are lifted up Lord and the
[52:37] sword going forth Lord may you have
[52:40] preeminence or God here in our midst
[52:42] Lord and fulfill and accomplish your
[52:44] word Lord to minister to every need we
[52:46] pray now in the precious name of the
[52:49] Lord Jesus Christ amen
[52:51] god bless you you may be seated let's
[52:55] look here just for a moment in Exodus
[52:59] chapter 4 if we could I I want to go and
[53:04] I want to look here a little bit on the
[53:07] rod of God
[53:17] now we see here in exodus chapter 4
[53:20] verse 1 here's Moses he sees he's come
[53:25] aside the Lord has already been speaking
[53:27] to him concerning the promise and Moses
[53:31] and verse 1 answers and said Behold they
[53:33] will not believe me nor hearken unto my
[53:36] voice for they will say the Lord hath
[53:38] not appeared unto thee and the Lord said
[53:43] unto Him what is that in thine hand and
[53:46] he said a rod Moses already knew what he
[53:52] had in his hand but God is now wanting
[53:57] to show him what he has in his hands
[54:00] that it is more than just what he has
[54:04] been carrying around so he's at when God
[54:09] asked the question it's not that we
[54:11] would instruct him God asks a question
[54:14] and it's it caused us to think to
[54:17] consider who do you say who do men say
[54:20] that I am NOT that they would tell him
[54:22] he wants them to think who do men say
[54:25] that I am where are we who do you say
[54:28] that I am well is this the time of the
[54:31] end
[54:31] sirs it's a question so what is that in
[54:36] that hand and he said a rod and he said
[54:38] cast it on the ground now notice this
[54:40] take what you have in your hand cast it
[54:42] on the ground and he cast it on the
[54:44] ground and it became a serpent and Moses
[54:48] fled from before it and the Lord said
[54:50] unto Moses put forth thine hand and take
[54:53] it by the tail and he put forth his hand
[54:56] and caught it and it became a rod in his
[55:00] hand that they may believe that the Lord
[55:04] God of their fathers the God of Abraham
[55:06] the god of Isaac and the God of Jacob
[55:09] hath appeared unto thee I I think it's
[55:14] beautiful in the word he says the rod
[55:16] became it the rod itself became from
[55:22] just that of a rod that Moses had walked
[55:26] around with and undoubtedly this was a
[55:28] rod that was fit
[55:30] for a shepherd it was a rod that was fit
[55:32] to herd sheep it was a fitting fitting
[55:35] tool but Moses was not aware of what was
[55:40] actually there within his hand but
[55:42] there's no one that can make him aware
[55:44] of it nor could it become to the
[55:46] potential as it can in the presence of
[55:50] God just carrying that rod around he
[55:53] herded sheep but now in the presence of
[55:56] God it becomes more than just a tool for
[55:59] herding of sheep now in the in in the
[56:02] presence of God this is made known as
[56:05] something that is able to come forth and
[56:08] it's able to swallow up it's able to
[56:11] transform from just a rod to become a
[56:14] serpent serpent representing what sin
[56:17] it's able to become from a rod to that
[56:20] of sin what is this whole the whole
[56:22] transition here in Exodus for this is
[56:25] the great condensation of God coming
[56:27] down and coming right among us God
[56:29] Himself holy righteous and now God
[56:32] coming that one who has led us one who
[56:34] has watched over Israel one who has
[56:36] guided one is a great Shepherd of the
[56:38] flock but now he comes down and he comes
[56:40] down to do what to take the curse of sin
[56:43] upon himself and in the midst of the
[56:47] situation we know down in Egypt God God
[56:50] doesn't let him know what's going to
[56:52] take place down in Egypt that you're
[56:54] gonna be confronted with Jennie's and
[56:56] jamberries they're gonna throw down
[56:58] their rods and they're gonna become a
[57:01] surface god doesn't let him know that
[57:03] but their God doesn't need to let him
[57:06] know that one only thing that Moses it's
[57:09] necessary from Moses or any of us is
[57:12] that we meet God face to face and that
[57:14] it becomes the not just a promise but it
[57:18] becomes a living reality to us then it
[57:20] becomes that which is more than a match
[57:23] for anything that the enemy has that's
[57:28] the confidence we have and here in the
[57:31] midst of that time the rod became and
[57:34] that raw they're standing in Pharaoh's
[57:37] Hall that rod became and when the rod
[57:41] became its swallow
[57:43] the other serpents the other serpents
[57:46] had no power over that rod the others
[57:49] had rods but they didn't have this rod
[57:53] it's not just to have a rod it's to have
[57:56] this rod there was something different
[57:58] about this rod it wasn't the kind of
[58:01] material that was made out of it was
[58:04] what was laying inside of it
[58:06] Oh glory it's what it represented what
[58:12] was laying inside of it and there in the
[58:15] midst of Pharaoh's Hall oh my how that
[58:17] we can see this in the life of the Lord
[58:20] Jesus death is swallowed up in victory
[58:24] this rod could lead about sheep but this
[58:28] rod until it come here in the place of
[58:31] the Prince of God there was no
[58:32] deliverance to the children of Israel
[58:34] but once it come into the presence of
[58:38] God this rod became a tool in the hand
[58:41] of Moses and what did it do
[58:43] it brought a deliverance to the people
[58:46] of Israel it was God moving sovereignly
[58:50] what's this how the Prophet places that
[58:53] in this great servant Moses 1955 he said
[58:57] as Moses went with the judgment stick
[58:59] before him that same stick tonight to
[59:02] the church is Jesus Christ
[59:04] if those Egyptians could have ever got
[59:06] that little simple stick out of Moses
[59:10] hands they'd have had him whipped if
[59:14] they could have got that little simple
[59:15] stick out of his hands they'd have had
[59:17] him whipped and when the devil listen to
[59:19] this now and when the devil can never
[59:21] get the deity out of the name of Jesus
[59:24] Christ
[59:24] he's got the church whipped it's not
[59:28] just a rod it takes the deity of Jesus
[59:31] Christ in the church and that's what
[59:35] Satan has been after all the way down
[59:38] through the ages is to take the deity
[59:40] they meant to take the life of God from
[59:43] the Church of the Living God
[59:45] because when the deity of Jesus Christ
[59:47] is present in that name
[59:50] demons tremble there is nothing to stand
[59:53] before that word this is what Moses was
[59:57] holding that day his hands were lifted
[1:00:01] in the air the rod not the rod of Moses
[1:00:03] the rod of God Moses said I'll take the
[1:00:08] rod of God oh my I'll tell you what the
[1:00:10] hands of Moses God used him when there
[1:00:12] were plagues down in Egypt and where
[1:00:14] they rose said pray that these things be
[1:00:16] taken away Moses said I'll lift up my
[1:00:19] hands to the Lord and pray that these
[1:00:21] things will be taken away Moses went out
[1:00:23] lifted up his hands and God removed
[1:00:26] those plagues from the Egyptians hey man
[1:00:29] it wasn't just God God was using just
[1:00:32] even that of hands but it was that that
[1:00:35] which is lifted up unto the Lord that
[1:00:37] word that has now become substance hands
[1:00:40] being action hands been doing hands
[1:00:43] being divine application
[1:00:46] amen amen

[1:04:42] lot it gives a lot power within it
[1:04:45] because it's a prevailing power

[1:05:48] and things are going too fast God didn't
[1:05:50] leave nothing out but when the moment is
[1:05:56] needed he opens our eyes that we can see
[1:06:02] glory and there's already been a prayer
[1:06:06] of intercession that's bait
[1:06:09] Lord calm this man's fear there's more
[1:06:13] with us than there is against us what
[1:06:16] was that that's the same voice of

[1:06:23] one right hand it's a power authority
[1:06:25] what's in that right hand the seven
[1:06:27] stars of God that revelation of Jesus

[1:06:47] Lord
[1:06:47] this mountain shall be removed notice
[1:06:53] Deuteronomy 1217 remember what Amalek
[1:06:57] did unto thee by the way when you were
[1:07:00] come forth out of Egypt how he meant me
[1:07:02] by the way and smoke behind most of the
[1:07:04] even all that were feeble behind thee

[1:07:10] feared not God you see God gods kept the
[1:07:15] detail on it amulet did not come at the
[1:07:19] front he came to attack not just the
[1:07:23] back but what was weak he came to attack
[1:07:28] that which was feeble Satan is an
[1:07:32] opportunist that right he he will try to
[1:07:39] get one that singled out you understand
[1:07:45] what I'm saying
[1:07:46] you can come to set right here and he
[1:07:48] singled you out yet you're in the middle

[1:08:28] LORD thy God hath given the rest from
[1:08:30] all thine enemies round about in the
[1:08:34] land which the LORD thy God giveth thee
[1:08:35] for an inheritance to possess it that
[1:08:37] thou shall blot out the remembrance of
[1:08:39] Amalek from under heaven thou shalt not
[1:08:42] forget it God remembers and he takes
[1:08:55] account of this approach
[1:08:58] you don't read this you don't read this
[1:09:01] of the other nations like this you don't
[1:09:04] read this but God lets him know when you

[1:09:30] brother and sister if we think that we
[1:09:32] can take the word and do something about
[1:09:34] it we are mistaken but God speaks his
[1:09:38] word that you and I might come to that
[1:09:40] place to say Lord I need you Lord to
[1:09:43] accomplish this Lord I need your power
[1:09:45] your grace your spirit Lord Lord I can't

[1:10:13] deity a God to come down into the rugs
[1:10:17] amen the deities are coming to the rod
[1:10:20] Oh glory be to God in the highest
[1:10:24] hey man the deity of Almighty God not
[1:10:28] just a name but the deity as God told
[1:10:34] Israel when you go through the land he
[1:10:37] said when all nations shall see that
[1:10:38] you're a people that's called by my name
[1:10:45] yeah you see this how God presents this
[1:10:50] very thing right here - to saw in 1st
[1:10:54] Samuel 15 here is Israel's come to a
[1:10:59] place remember they they they're
[1:11:03] fulfilling prophecy what God spoke in
[1:11:05] num and Deuteronomy when you come into
[1:11:08] the land you're gonna see how all the
[1:11:10] other nations have kings and you're
[1:11:13] gonna want to start to be like them you
[1:11:16] see it's important that you remove
[1:11:18] things from your eyes they're right I
[1:11:26] won't ask you the question but I don't
[1:11:29] think anybody any of you if you do you
[1:11:31] shouldn't you don't drive we're looking
[1:11:33] backwards why what do you look forward
[1:11:40] you gotta see where you're going it's
[1:11:46] children of God we don't look back
[1:11:49] God will bring back to our remembrance
[1:11:52] but we don't look back
[1:11:56] will it forward amen
[1:12:01] listen to me now unclean spirits look
[1:12:03] back but the Spirit of God looks forward
[1:12:09] unclean spirits look to an earthly
[1:12:11] origin but the Spirit of God knows he
[1:12:14] come from God going back to God hey man
[1:12:18] were not that of unclean spirits that
[1:12:21] look for earthly origin dies it's the
[1:12:24] Spirit of God will let onward he saw he
[1:12:29] picked out head and shoulders above all
[1:12:31] of them
[1:12:31] this guy's a good guy man nice-looking
[1:12:34] church ooh
[1:12:36] head and shoulders above everybody he
[1:12:40] was the people's choice and God gave
[1:12:43] them according to their choice God will
[1:12:47] not force his way and got and got
[1:12:49] through sandal now listen this here is
[1:12:51] Samuel one whom God hath revealed
[1:12:54] himself to in Shiloh by his word they're
[1:13:00] right here as Samuel was the word of the
[1:13:03] Lord the gift not not only is Saul
[1:13:05] anointed but here is leadership after
[1:13:08] the anointing you must follow what the
[1:13:10] Prophet says do are you ask me to have
[1:13:15] the anointing and not follow what the
[1:13:16] Prophet says do is to question what is
[1:13:20] beneath the anointing come on friends
[1:13:23] him and anointing is not wrong but it's
[1:13:27] what is beneath the anointing what comes
[1:13:31] forth where does it lead to what does it
[1:13:34] lean to the right and the message
[1:13:37] rapture the Prophet says when the Holy
[1:13:39] Spirit falls upon that cell and it takes
[1:13:42] off to a denomination that is a
[1:13:44] denominational anointing it's the
[1:13:47] genuine Holy Ghost but it's what's down
[1:13:50] beneath there that's why the deception
[1:13:53] in this hour were people said I'm born
[1:13:55] of the Spirit I've got the Holy Ghost
[1:13:56] the Spirit filled but yet here's what is
[1:13:59] it on the inside isn't lining up of the
[1:14:02] word a show that punctuates every word
[1:14:05] of God with an Amen right
[1:14:08] remember the Prophet said over and over
[1:14:10] Pentecost there is where you failed he
[1:14:13] said it into earlier messages and all
[1:14:15] the way to the ladder in
[1:14:19] why it's a deeper walk than just a
[1:14:21] sanctified life the Holy Ghost produces
[1:14:24] sanctification but it's a deeper walk
[1:14:27] that's why the Prophet said how can
[1:14:29] overcome people is it good people can
[1:14:32] live above adultery live above all these
[1:14:34] other things and still not with it it's
[1:14:37] about the love of God in your heart I
[1:14:41] think God for good clean moral people
[1:14:44] but friends I'm talking about a rapture
[1:14:47] I'm that call just to make good clean
[1:14:50] moral people the deity of Jesus Christ
[1:14:53] will do that are you with me
[1:14:59] the probably tells us over and over he
[1:15:02] said if it did it there among those
[1:15:03] natives in Africa if that same Holy
[1:15:06] Ghost coming down there did it there he
[1:15:08] said it'll do the same thing in the
[1:15:10] United States why the Spirit of God is
[1:15:12] the Spirit of God glory be to God you
[1:15:22] love him
[1:15:23] Athene friends this is a remedy this is
[1:15:26] a remedy the deity of Jesus Christ but
[1:15:29] deity having that life on the inside
[1:15:31] that's the remedy look at sin look at
[1:15:39] Saul here Saul you know he goes up and
[1:15:45] he's following everything I'm gonna read
[1:15:47] all of it but he goes up and he tells
[1:15:50] that there you know the the the Kenites
[1:15:53] in verse 6 he tells them you know get
[1:15:55] out from among their malachite you know
[1:15:57] we didn't we don't we're not we're not
[1:15:59] after you guys right now we've we don't
[1:16:01] want that we unless we destroy you
[1:16:02] because why he knows he's got a charge
[1:16:05] the charge wasn't Amalekites and Kim and
[1:16:08] and Kim tights it was a malachite God is
[1:16:13] precise on his charge
[1:16:16] we'll get to the Kim tights we'll get to
[1:16:19] those fights we'll get to those things
[1:16:22] but right now it's the Amalekites you
[1:16:26] know why because Amalekites this is the
[1:16:29] representation of that which is born
[1:16:31] after the flesh are you with me now now
[1:16:35] notice how saw this man is troubled in
[1:16:39] his spirit he goes to reasoning
[1:16:42] he's got the word of the Lord but now he
[1:16:44] starts reasoning with me he starts
[1:16:47] looking at it and saying yeah let's get
[1:16:51] rid all the diseased ones let's let's
[1:16:54] get rid of all them let's keep those
[1:16:56] that are good and I'll tell you what
[1:16:58] we'll do with them well bring them back
[1:17:00] here and we'll sacrifice um unto God
[1:17:02] that sounds good but that's death to
[1:17:08] keep anything that God has said get rid
[1:17:12] of it to keep it is death Saul doesn't
[1:17:18] realize but this very decision that he's
[1:17:21] making is going to remove the kingdom
[1:17:25] from him what he's showing within he's
[1:17:30] not worthy to have it all friends let
[1:17:34] our hearts be tender let our hearts be
[1:17:37] tender let it be that if there's
[1:17:39] anything that is not like him at all say
[1:17:42] God take it out Lord Lord remove it from
[1:17:46] me oh my friends let me tell you
[1:17:49] something you don't have to wait to an
[1:17:51] end of the service you can receive power
[1:17:54] right there you can receive deliverance
[1:17:57] right there healing right there they met
[1:18:01] have there's something that's wrong
[1:18:02] reach out and take a hold of God and say
[1:18:05] God you're speaking to me Lord let Daddy
[1:18:08] fall in the rod this morning Lord but
[1:18:11] they're to come in this rod Lord God if
[1:18:17] your hands have got heavy it has gotten
[1:18:20] weak if it's gotten down say Lord lift
[1:18:22] me up Lord God David said when my heart
[1:18:26] is overwhelmed Oh lead me to the
[1:18:29] Rock lead me to the rock that is higher
[1:18:32] than I they meant David knew what it was
[1:18:36] like to get hated Devon knew what it was
[1:18:38] like to have fear and he said let me
[1:18:39] come rest under your wings Oh God let me
[1:18:43] find a place there Oh glory be to God
[1:18:47] friends let me tell you something if
[1:18:48] there was a bomb that was coming and
[1:18:51] there was news as that was going on
[1:18:53] right now there would be everyone would
[1:18:55] be seeking for shelter let me tell you
[1:18:58] something the shelter that God has
[1:19:00] provided in this hour is not a bomb
[1:19:03] shelter made out of concrete but the
[1:19:05] Bible is clear it prophesied of this
[1:19:08] hour that in this day unmad shall be as
[1:19:11] a cover a man shall be as a shelter that
[1:19:14] man is none other than Jesus Christ amen
[1:19:19] he is our refuge he is our hero when you
[1:19:25] and I resort to glory glory glory sandy
[1:19:37] took verse eight and he took a gang the
[1:19:40] king of the Amalekites alive Wow and
[1:19:49] utterly destroyed all the people with
[1:19:54] the edge of the sword
[1:19:59] I don't know what was going through
[1:20:01] Saul's mind I don't know what was going
[1:20:05] through his mind but it's got to be
[1:20:08] pretty evident that there had to been
[1:20:09] some kind of dialogue or something going
[1:20:11] on here something affected Saul's heart
[1:20:17] come on somebody but it affected it in
[1:20:21] such a way of deception to where when he
[1:20:23] returns back to Samuel he's coming to
[1:20:26] Samuel said I have done all that the
[1:20:28] Lord has spoken that means that I hear
[1:20:32] your words but I hear something in the
[1:20:33] background and what I'm hearing is is
[1:20:39] disobedience what I'm hearing is is
[1:20:43] chosen rebellion what I'm hearing is is
[1:20:46] you're doing Saul what you want to do
[1:20:55] but he destroyed all the rest of the
[1:20:58] other people all of them notice verse 9
[1:21:02] said but Saul and the people spared a
[1:21:06] god you know it's important to look at
[1:21:07] these words this word spared means to
[1:21:10] half pity or compassion on I'll tell you
[1:21:15] this sometimes that's one of the biggest
[1:21:16] hindrances to the gospel is pity that's
[1:21:22] one of the biggest hindrances to things
[1:21:25] is human compassion
[1:21:36] yell with me
[1:21:38] the pool of siloam the place that of
[1:21:43] bethesda right House of seats of mercy
[1:21:50] seats of mercy and here the Lord Jesus
[1:21:53] comes walking down there in the midst of
[1:21:57] all of those who are sick the Prophet
[1:22:05] tells us Jesus stepped over water had
[1:22:08] babies he stepped over some to a cancer
[1:22:12] ridden you know the Prophet dramas I say
[1:22:16] God allowed us to have eyes to see into
[1:22:21] the word in this hour so what so that it
[1:22:25] would direct this innermost being
[1:22:28] because if it would us with oh oh and
[1:22:32] not that we don't have compassion listen
[1:22:35] friends I'm not talking about hardness
[1:22:37] but this compassion the Prophet said
[1:22:39] that when Jesus walked down through
[1:22:41] there it wasn't human compassion
[1:22:44] it was compassion according to the will
[1:22:47] of God that's a big difference
[1:22:51] human compassion wouldn't have done
[1:22:54] nothing there remember Jesus was a man
[1:23:01] so we can't say he don't know how I feel
[1:23:04] no he knows how we feel he knows when
[1:23:08] we're tempted in compassion right he
[1:23:13] understands those things but notice
[1:23:16] brother Graham said this man about 30 he
[1:23:18] said now the scriptures of 38 years old
[1:23:20] he said the man for I had a prostrate
[1:23:22] prior I always say wrong prostate
[1:23:24] condition nothing big they put it like
[1:23:30] this this guy maybe let's say let's say
[1:23:32] he had a problem with his leg couldn't
[1:23:34] walk right you and I would say this guy
[1:23:36] or this one was the cancer this was a
[1:23:38] leg hey let's go after this row here the
[1:23:40] cancer this guy can live he can get
[1:23:42] around on that leg
[1:23:43] this shows God don't look at things the
[1:23:46] way we look at it
[1:23:49] you understand clotting wasting time
[1:23:52] friends but Saul and the people spared a
[1:23:59] gag and the best of not just sheath the
[1:24:02] best of dispirited and of the oxen and
[1:24:06] of the fatlings and the lambs in all
[1:24:09] that was good who said it was good come
[1:24:15] on somebody who said it was good
[1:24:17] what's he what's he comparing this to
[1:24:20] well it's a better sheep compared to
[1:24:23] that no no no no no no no no no it's
[1:24:26] compare these sheep with the word are
[1:24:31] you with me
[1:24:31] compare this sheep with the word let me
[1:24:36] tell you friends this is how serious
[1:24:37] this is
[1:24:39] it removes Saul and took the kingdom
[1:24:42] from him to allow things to reside and
[1:24:46] remain in your life can remove you from
[1:24:48] the rapture you say remove me from the
[1:24:53] rapture yeah you can be right on track
[1:24:55] but perfect love perfect love is to
[1:25:00] reign within your life how the Prophet
[1:25:03] came back from beyond the curtain of
[1:25:04] time he said I can never long longer be
[1:25:07] the same william branham that i was he
[1:25:09] didn't get born again again but that
[1:25:13] became even more real more precious more
[1:25:18] valued let me tell you something friends
[1:25:20] yes I would love to look beyond the
[1:25:23] curtain of time I would love to be able
[1:25:25] to you know looking and see my dad but
[1:25:27] you know I don't need to do that to have
[1:25:29] a faith because this faith that God
[1:25:33] brought and delivered right through the
[1:25:35] message in this hour that revelation it
[1:25:38] has brought heaven down so real it is me
[1:25:43] Christ so real that is made Christ
[1:25:47] tangible it has brought him down to
[1:25:49] where he's now standing in Bride form to
[1:25:53] I can shake hands with my brother with
[1:25:56] my sister and I can see Christ being
[1:26:00] unveiled amen to get a foretaste of
[1:26:03] heaven to get afar taste of glory as his
[1:26:08] presence sweeps in among us strengthens
[1:26:11] us and charges us by his deity of his
[1:26:14] life so he kept certain things I want
[1:26:23] you to the heart has taken to this quote
[1:26:29] the Lord just directed me here upon this
[1:26:31] and that's what I begin to deal with me
[1:26:36] very familiar place for many of you that
[1:26:38] following the message but it's a word of
[1:26:42] admonition to the church in Christ as
[1:26:43] the mystery and the Prophet says it like
[1:26:47] this he said brother Neville goes
[1:26:49] through many strains and heartaches that
[1:26:51] he doesn't show it here at the
[1:26:53] Tabernacle but being that the Lord lets
[1:26:56] me have a little sight into people's
[1:26:58] live I know what he goes through a whole
[1:27:00] lot of it see and he certainly goes
[1:27:03] under a lot of labour and strings and
[1:27:05] things and you people here hold him up
[1:27:09] like Joshua and Caleb held at the hands
[1:27:12] of Moses as he's bringing the word so I
[1:27:18] ask you how do you hold up my hands if
[1:27:22] I'm your pastor how do you hold up my
[1:27:24] hands do you are you there you know at
[1:27:28] my house you know you guys take turns
[1:27:31] and we're gonna rotate people in I'm
[1:27:33] just trying to make it simple as God
[1:27:34] will bring it to me how are my hands
[1:27:37] held up here is the are my are my hands
[1:27:40] held up because what brother Sam you
[1:27:42] know he's a he's a funny guy I like
[1:27:43] being around brother Sam you know you
[1:27:44] kind of lightens things up that's not
[1:27:46] that's not holding up my hands you you
[1:27:49] may not our personalities may not mesh
[1:27:52] real well but yet you can still be
[1:27:53] holding up my hands you understand
[1:27:57] friends I mean it's just the truth I
[1:27:58] mean maybe not all of our personalities
[1:28:00] but God God brought us together you know
[1:28:03] why because we need that from one
[1:28:05] another
[1:28:06] we need that from one another God knows
[1:28:08] I got greenness in my life and that
[1:28:10] greenness has got to get baked out I'll
[1:28:15] save for amen for you too
[1:28:18] well has it got to do it it's got to be
[1:28:20] light shining through and hold somebody
[1:28:24] who's got to be light so where is it
[1:28:26] Jesus said ye are the light of the world
[1:28:30] Amen it takes that where that word being
[1:28:32] preached in the world bringing maturity
[1:28:34] that's why real truth fellowship with
[1:28:37] one another is so vital and important
[1:28:39] that fellowship around the word is so
[1:28:42] important I fellowship that fellowship
[1:28:47] with ministers and honor on a thing here
[1:28:49] and I'll tell you what things it just
[1:28:51] challenges my heart very good as we look
[1:28:54] at many different things challenges me I
[1:28:56] love that it challenges me when I sit
[1:28:59] down talking with different ones here
[1:29:01] within this assembly how not friends
[1:29:04] it's not about what you can quote what
[1:29:05] you can say I don't care what you can
[1:29:07] quote that one that is that I want like
[1:29:10] to see that word being lived
[1:29:13] that's what beats in my heart is that
[1:29:15] word that's being expressed and that
[1:29:17] word that's being lived the matter if
[1:29:21] you can quote an exact quote with the
[1:29:22] Prophet said or quote this scripture put
[1:29:24] that down that don't impress me I'm not
[1:29:26] looking for that I can quote the quotes
[1:29:28] I can quote the scripture but it's about
[1:29:29] that life that's being lived it's a
[1:29:31] testimony that's held up what is it it's
[1:29:34] deity of Christ inside of the rod that
[1:29:37] says here's alive here's a trophy here's
[1:29:39] a victory here's a testimony
[1:29:42] here's one I don't hold up the hands of
[1:29:47] my pastor I tell you just told you
[1:29:55] letting the deity of God reign in your
[1:29:57] life letting the word have preeminence
[1:30:01] in your life the word that's being
[1:30:03] ministered the word that's being
[1:30:05] preached let it have three minutes in
[1:30:06] your life until your friends just being
[1:30:09] associated with this church is not
[1:30:11] letting the word have preeminence in
[1:30:12] your life
[1:30:15] yes sir then associated with this
[1:30:17] message is not letting the word have
[1:30:19] preeminence in your life it's got to
[1:30:21] become one with you you've got to become
[1:30:23] one with it but Johnny in heaven a
[1:30:29] shotgun wedding in this time Johnny has
[1:30:35] no shotgun ready God ain't bringing no
[1:30:37] body appearance and you're gonna get
[1:30:38] married to me right now he's got old and
[1:30:44] new the whole Bible's a brand new book
[1:30:47] but he ain't having a shotgun wedding
[1:30:50] he ain't gonna pull push rod he calls
[1:30:54] the Bible says that in this hour
[1:30:57] Ephesians 1:11 he will gather all things
[1:31:01] unto himself and the gathering of the
[1:31:05] people shall be unto him how do I hold
[1:31:08] up the hands of my pastor look at
[1:31:11] Ephesians look at the book and look at
[1:31:15] the book of Ephesians here Paul comes
[1:31:17] among them now
[1:31:18] yet Paul is standing there we know a
[1:31:20] messenger they oppose also tending there
[1:31:22] among the people and Paul here he is
[1:31:26] looking and he deals with something that
[1:31:28] they could look at and it don't seem as
[1:31:30] deep as the first few chapters but it's
[1:31:34] home life Paul I thought she was going
[1:31:39] to talk about the seventh seal this
[1:31:40] morning I am I'm bringing the seals from
[1:31:44] just a writer
[1:31:44] I'm bringing it down to your life what
[1:31:48] is it it's a message of application
[1:31:52] what's he doing he's bringing the deity
[1:31:54] into the word the deity into the rod he
[1:32:00] there's a home life they they needed
[1:32:03] admonition on how to operate a husband
[1:32:08] and wife or one maybe they were bad it's
[1:32:11] just they needed a little bit of
[1:32:13] admonition who could
[1:32:18] maybe we'd have to pick this one up next
[1:32:20] week as well there's a whole lot tucked
[1:32:24] in here too but he dealt with those
[1:32:27] things why was it because he recognized
[1:32:29] if this isn't dealt with God made him
[1:32:32] aware of it if it's not dealt with and
[1:32:36] everything else that he has ministered
[1:32:37] on in a chapter one chosen and God and
[1:32:40] Christ before the foundation well if
[1:32:42] these little things what is called
[1:32:44] little things are they're not dealt with
[1:32:47] then that expression cannot come forth
[1:32:52] correctly so everything is important
[1:33:00] remember remember if the Egyptians could
[1:33:03] have just got that simple little stick
[1:33:08] hmm but to you who know it's not a
[1:33:11] simple little stick this is the rod of
[1:33:15] God
[1:33:16] so it's how we're looking at it how
[1:33:19] we're gonna value it gives it a simple
[1:33:21] little stick or is it the rod of God
[1:33:34] your view will determine how you handle
[1:33:37] it your hand if your knee wrecking that
[1:33:41] you're valuing it as the rod of God
[1:33:43] because the deity of Christ is there
[1:33:45] within it you value your life Val your
[1:33:47] actions value behavior value what you
[1:33:49] think I'm talking about holding up the
[1:33:54] hands of the pastor hoping to say I pay
[1:34:00] my time I'm talking about holding up the
[1:34:02] hands of the pastor come on friends I
[1:34:05] talk about holding up the hands the
[1:34:08] pastor there's a lot of churches all the
[1:34:09] way down through here all the way over
[1:34:11] they've got good taxpayers in them they
[1:34:14] benefit from that principle in the world
[1:34:16] that ain't a message principle that's a
[1:34:18] scriptural principle the message being a
[1:34:21] scriptural message picks it up and says
[1:34:23] this still applies
[1:34:26] the right the people benefit from it
[1:34:29] because they applied the money principle
[1:34:33] whoo glory be to God but I'm talking
[1:34:38] about holding up the hands of the pastor
[1:34:42] holding up the hands the bastard telling
[1:34:45] what a great guy he is if you don't got
[1:34:48] my number I'll give it to you so you
[1:34:49] could text me nothing what I'm looking
[1:34:53] for were friends then they need at all
[1:34:55] you know I've had people that have come
[1:34:57] here and said I'll tell you what man
[1:34:58] it's the best thing in the world my
[1:35:00] goodness
[1:35:01] those kind of people scare me cuz I know
[1:35:04] it's only a time it's only a period of
[1:35:07] time you said brother Sam you are not
[1:35:10] think that I'm friends listen I'm just
[1:35:11] looking at what patterns have been if
[1:35:15] God leads somebody to come here
[1:35:17] they better be led to come here because
[1:35:19] they're gonna see a lot of they're gonna
[1:35:21] see humanity they're gonna see a lot of
[1:35:22] thing but they gotta recognize it was
[1:35:24] not coming here because of a personality
[1:35:26] have come here be closed off the ladder
[1:35:29] and Christ has led me here what would
[1:35:34] come now change this little bit change
[1:35:35] that change this I would change that
[1:35:37] change that someone would come I don't
[1:35:42] buy a car and say you know I'm by this
[1:35:43] car but no paint just here and paint
[1:35:46] that there I don't like this here why
[1:35:48] you buy you're gonna pay into paying
[1:35:49] more money it'll cost you more it'll
[1:35:53] cost you a lot friends if you're just
[1:35:55] looking for a trench to change this here
[1:35:56] change that there change that there why
[1:35:58] cuz you're looking at changing so many
[1:36:00] other things that's you ain't looking at
[1:36:02] the most important thing and that's
[1:36:03] where the word to change you name em
[1:36:09] what we talking about Badia t in the
[1:36:13] name of Jesus Christ
[1:36:16] men are Samuel you're human I'm reminded
[1:36:19] of that every day every day I'm reminded
[1:36:22] of that and brother Doug especially
[1:36:27] after I preached a while I'm reminded of
[1:36:29] it the next day but also in the book of
[1:36:33] Ephesians he also told her put away
[1:36:35] bitterness
[1:36:37] is that right he didn't say well you
[1:36:41] know you're just praying you know he
[1:36:42] said you put it away what you need to
[1:36:46] look back and recognize where you come
[1:36:48] from there is authority in recognizing
[1:36:51] who you are recognize who you are what's
[1:36:57] he doing is calling their attention to
[1:36:59] things that would seem so simple and
[1:37:01] little but can hinder the handling of
[1:37:06] the rod or just situation my hands are
[1:37:13] getting heavy sit down on the stove I've
[1:37:20] got some ministering of the work that'll
[1:37:22] lift your hands up the right The
[1:37:27] ministers wired is sent to encourage us
[1:37:29] that our hands be lifted up

[1:37:35] life what is in the hands when God
[1:37:37] speaks of it visitation down the egypt
[1:37:40] and delivering by mighty hand what is it
[1:37:42] it's God personifying his dissension
[1:37:46] down in humanity how do I hold up the
[1:37:51] hands of my pastor hmm what is a good
[1:37:56] one who maybe way to preach 50 parts on
[1:37:57] this one you understand what I'm saying

[1:38:05] what I'm saying is if you look at and
[1:38:08] say well what no Sam you're trying to do
[1:38:09] you know what brother Bram talking about
[1:38:11] here you know holding up the hands of my
[1:38:13] pastor what one brother brems are
[1:38:15] talking about so much as far as the man
[1:38:18] what brother Ram is dealing with is so
[1:38:20] that the word that God desires to
[1:38:23] deliver doesn't become hindered are you
[1:38:30] with me God's interested in keeping
[1:38:33] channels clog-free God set Drano before
[1:38:38] they ever invented it yes sir God since
[1:38:43] then by his Spirit to do I clean up
[1:38:45] clogs cause clogs cause things to back
[1:38:48] up the water ain't meant to do
[1:38:50] back up in the sink and back up in the
[1:38:54] signal the water his men as you're
[1:38:56] washing that the water is running down
[1:38:59] and it's taken the contaminants with it
[1:39:03] that's what a real life doesn't submit
[1:39:06] it to God that has a heart that says
[1:39:08] Lord train me Lord God if there's
[1:39:11] anything in me at all
[1:39:12] transit holla me Lord God let the deity
[1:39:15] of Almighty God move down and cleansing
[1:39:18] out in my life if there's something in
[1:39:20] my landlord let it be cleaned out why I
[1:39:23] don't want to keep washing my hands in
[1:39:26] the same stuff over and over I want it
[1:39:29] to be washed away with the washing of
[1:39:31] water by the word
[1:39:33] what does that the rod of God handle I
[1:39:40] hold up the hands of my pastor in
[1:39:44] Galatians Paul Cheema mother Paul he's
[1:39:54] seen where there were those who came
[1:39:57] among them and Paul you know Paul had a
[1:40:05] way of putting things you know what I
[1:40:06] mean
[1:40:07] Paul didn't just call everybody brother
[1:40:11] am I wrong am i right
[1:40:16] well said men false brethren in Jude
[1:40:23] chapter 1 certain men not brethren
[1:40:26] certain men crept in unawares God
[1:40:34] identifies that friends listen Paul
[1:40:36] wasn't saying nothing that wasn't
[1:40:37] identified you understand me this wasn't
[1:40:40] slander slaying put down he's simply
[1:40:43] identifying when God identifies things
[1:40:48] it's to put the church at rest
[1:40:50] why because it lets them know I've
[1:40:52] already known this they're right here
[1:40:57] comes in men this is the thing that you
[1:40:59] look at these things these guys came
[1:41:02] into Galatia
[1:41:03] they didn't care about the people they
[1:41:06] didn't care they came right among the
[1:41:09] people and started telling them you
[1:41:10] gotta go back you got to do this you got
[1:41:12] to do that you got to keep this you got
[1:41:13] to keep that your righteousness is and
[1:41:15] this your holy what are they doing
[1:41:16] removing them from the revelation that
[1:41:20] PAH has delivered to them
[1:41:23] that's your righteousness he's in Jesus
[1:41:26] Christ by the righteousness of God
[1:41:28] dwelling in you and you in him by the
[1:41:32] love of God that's what Paul could bring
[1:41:35] it around in Chapter five faith worketh
[1:41:37] by love and Paul deals in Galatians and
[1:41:41] lets him know you're not gonna conquer
[1:41:43] Amalek with your strength is that right
[1:41:49] the flesh lusteth against the spirit the
[1:41:52] spirit against the flesh he's letting
[1:41:54] them know a Mallick the flesh cannot be
[1:41:57] conquered by your strength and your
[1:41:59] might and you say well Paul I'm baptized
[1:42:03] in the Holy Ghost
[1:42:04] Paul said then if you live in the spirit
[1:42:07] you also should walk in the spirit
[1:42:10] see notice what he's telling he's
[1:42:12] applying those things not just living in
[1:42:14] it but walking walking means your life
[1:42:16] is conducted under the leadership of the
[1:42:18] Holy Spirit what you're doing he's
[1:42:20] taking what they have come in and they
[1:42:22] have made light of the rod as a simple
[1:42:26] little stick buzzer oh no no no no no
[1:42:29] this gospel this revelation that I
[1:42:32] delivered to you it is a simple little
[1:42:34] stick it is the revelation of Jesus
[1:42:38] Christ
[1:42:39] hey that's prevailing power within it
[1:42:44] Amen is that right I don't hold the
[1:42:48] hands of my pastor up Paul even dealt
[1:42:54] with it in the book of Corinthians you
[1:42:57] know we could spend many times in many
[1:42:59] of these places Paul dealt with it in
[1:43:01] the book of Corinthians they were
[1:43:02] elevating men why they had such a
[1:43:05] concept of man that you know as we said
[1:43:09] done before in it's it's it's time to be
[1:43:13] thankful for the vessels I'm thankful
[1:43:15] for every gift of God
[1:43:16] translucent I'm not
[1:43:17] just on my ministry I'm thankful for
[1:43:18] every believers life and I really mean
[1:43:21] that with all my heart but to see how
[1:43:25] that there were things that were moving
[1:43:28] among that was removing the deity away
[1:43:33] from the rod of God to wear that even
[1:43:38] it's reported
[1:43:39] Paul said it's reported among you that
[1:43:43] you're going in there and you're getting
[1:43:44] drunk it's made Facebook friends I don't
[1:43:52] say that to be funny but I'm telling you
[1:43:55] that's how Facebook was there that's how
[1:43:57] it would have been the community knew
[1:44:00] and Paul was letting them know you're
[1:44:02] bringing a reproach on the name of Jesus
[1:44:04] Christ that's what he was letting them
[1:44:08] know see what it is they're there
[1:44:11] they're failing to recognize now here
[1:44:12] here he comes right back around to do
[1:44:14] what he's bringing them back to the real
[1:44:16] truth of what communion is how the
[1:44:18] reference of their life Paul deals with
[1:44:20] how they're to keep their temple how do
[1:44:22] the Reverend said how they're to look at
[1:44:24] and notice he even takes a time the
[1:44:26] Spirit of God Christ first Corinthians
[1:44:28] and second Corinthians he causes them to
[1:44:30] reflect and consider that you are not
[1:44:32] your own you're bought with a price
[1:44:36] what's he saying that you don't have no
[1:44:39] right if you've been redeemed you
[1:44:42] forfeit your choice are you with me now
[1:44:46] he's letting them know he would be done
[1:44:48] he's bringing they're faking and
[1:44:50] consider that new you not your body is a
[1:44:53] temple of the Holy Ghost has let them
[1:44:56] know your life is to be filled with that
[1:44:58] deity glorify God therefore in your
[1:45:01] spirit and your body which belong to the
[1:45:03] Lord is that right he dealt with them on
[1:45:06] the gifts how they were miss handling
[1:45:10] the gifts they were just looking at
[1:45:12] these things and taking them lightly
[1:45:14] they had him in their midst but Paul
[1:45:18] said I sold unto thee a more excellent
[1:45:20] way oh I love that he didn't say I tell
[1:45:25] unto thee I show why because what Paul
[1:45:28] was getting ready to speak
[1:45:30] I was a witness it was an image living
[1:45:37] reality of this I shown to you a more
[1:45:39] excellent way what's what's he doing
[1:45:42] he's admonishing them my hands are
[1:45:44] coming down keep my hands up what what
[1:45:47] God has delivered keep it up what's he
[1:45:49] telling your life your lives the way
[1:45:52] you're living it's important the way
[1:45:53] your lives or what you're going about
[1:45:55] you can either hinder or you can lift up
[1:46:03] you love him
[1:46:10] Paul dealt with him that was 11
[1:46:15] that was among them as well is that
[1:46:17] right Levin that was among that back
[1:46:22] church and they were glory and Paul said
[1:46:26] your glorying is not good is that right
[1:46:30] he told him he said there's a situation
[1:46:32] in the church and you haven't even
[1:46:34] addressed it come on somebody
[1:46:38] he's Lila he tells them you've not even
[1:46:41] taken a can of this and you're going on
[1:46:44] in glorying and groaning blood what she
[1:46:47] said he said what happened is the deity
[1:46:49] is gonna be removed from your midst God
[1:46:59] is a gentleman he will give mercy and he
[1:47:02] will give grace but his mercy and His
[1:47:04] grace is not for continuance it's that
[1:47:08] things might be resolved are you with me
[1:47:15] God spoke of those things telling men
[1:47:19] 1st Corinthians 5 let's just go on over
[1:47:21] there 1st Corinthians chapter 5 just
[1:47:25] just stay right we'll just stay right at
[1:47:27] right where I'm at over there but let's
[1:47:29] go right into the I'll just want to go
[1:47:31] right into the scripture here 1st
[1:47:33] Corinthians chapter 5
[1:47:47] now what's what Paul is saying here in
[1:47:49] verse one now
[1:48:02] first Corinthians 5 verse 1 it is
[1:48:09] reported commonly that there is
[1:48:11] fornication among you and such
[1:48:12] fornication as is not so much as named
[1:48:16] among the Gentiles that one should have
[1:48:18] his father's wife and ye are puffed up
[1:48:21] and have not rather mourned that he that
[1:48:27] had done this deed might be taken away
[1:48:29] from among you oh no Paul where's your
[1:48:35] compassionate
[1:48:37] no it's there I said it's here for
[1:48:42] verily as absent in body but present in
[1:48:46] spirit have judged already as though I
[1:48:49] were present concerning him that hath so
[1:48:51] done this deed in the name of our Lord
[1:48:56] Jesus Christ when you are gathered
[1:48:58] together and my spirit with the power of
[1:49:01] our Lord Jesus Christ delivers such a
[1:49:03] one unto Satan for the destruction of
[1:49:05] the flesh that the spirit may be saved
[1:49:07] in the day of the Lord Jesus is just a
[1:49:11] word notice what Paul is saying I'm not
[1:49:14] there but I've already I've judged it
[1:49:18] what's he judged it by he says it's
[1:49:21] verse four in the name of our Lord Jesus
[1:49:23] Christ it's a the character the life of
[1:49:28] Jesus Christ the deity of Jesus Christ
[1:49:32] so he's letting me know you're not just
[1:49:34] getting together but in the name it's
[1:49:36] according to the word your glorying is
[1:49:39] not good no you're not that a little
[1:49:40] leaven leaveneth the whole lump purge
[1:49:43] out therefore the old leaven that you
[1:49:46] may be a new lump as you are on
[1:49:48] unleavened for even Christ our Passover
[1:49:50] is sacrificed for us what's out what's
[1:49:53] how what's how he goes with this purging
[1:49:55] out therefore let us keep the feast not
[1:49:58] with old leaven neither with the leaven
[1:50:00] of malice and wickedness but with the
[1:50:02] unleavened bread of sincerity and truth
[1:50:07] what's the unleavened bread Christ the
[1:50:12] word
[1:50:13] what's that great feast it's the Feast
[1:50:15] of the atonement the feast of Christ the
[1:50:20] feast of that word now notice what he's
[1:50:22] dealing with verse 7 and verse 8 Paul
[1:50:23] just does not leave it to that situation
[1:50:26] that's there but Paul lets them know hey
[1:50:28] you've got a purge out you've gotta get
[1:50:32] rid of and remove miss leaven out of
[1:50:35] your mints and he goes down into the
[1:50:36] depth of it the leaven of malice your
[1:50:40] malice is injurious thinking thinking
[1:50:45] that is injurious to another you as me
[1:50:51] this is where in Ephesians were posed to
[1:50:53] let all bitterness be put away from you
[1:50:56] let all with all malice with all malice
[1:50:59] see bitterness and malice come together
[1:51:03] they're right but bitterness just does
[1:51:07] not start as just like a big blob of
[1:51:10] bitterness that's dropped it don't start
[1:51:13] that way it starts with just something
[1:51:17] that can be a stop where you think
[1:51:23] somebody's wrong are you with me I know
[1:51:28] nobody nobody probably did that this is
[1:51:29] just for the people archiving but the
[1:51:34] Prophet said when you go to think this
[1:51:38] is the same prophet of God used by the
[1:51:40] Spirit of God that said there's not a
[1:51:41] scratch on Joseph except what he said
[1:51:45] there to Pharaoh or to his dad and said
[1:51:47] hey just just you know just tell him
[1:51:49] that you are herdsmen but that I went
[1:51:53] down into the prison he went down into
[1:51:56] prison and Paul prisoner brother Ram
[1:51:58] child takes us down there it says there
[1:51:59] was pride in Joseph's life what God had
[1:52:05] showed he was true and genuine but God
[1:52:07] sought a cat half pride handling that
[1:52:10] what was it it's gonna be the rod of God
[1:52:12] in the hand of God
[1:52:15] well thanks be to God aren't you glad
[1:52:17] for the hands of God
[1:52:19] the eyes of the Holy Spirit still here
[1:52:21] among us him searching us out and minute
[1:52:24] string around to the depths of our life
[1:52:26] as I search me Oh God
[1:52:28] I'll tell you friends in this hour we
[1:52:31] need that spiritual MRI where it's
[1:52:34] moving all around in our lives passing
[1:52:37] under the word coming back passing under
[1:52:39] the word coming back let me tell you
[1:52:41] something just like any of you ever went
[1:52:43] into heaven in our MRI they tell you got
[1:52:45] your little claustrophobic some people
[1:52:47] say I'm claustrophobic what do they tell
[1:52:49] you to do hey get some music and put
[1:52:51] some earbuds on and we'll play some
[1:52:53] music for you let me tell you something
[1:52:55] there's a new song being sung you can go
[1:52:58] through this MRI
[1:52:59] it's a MRI with the song of redemption
[1:53:02] that is crying out a song of redemption
[1:53:05] that says I have overcome and you shall
[1:53:11] overcome hey man hallelujah amen
[1:53:22] look at it you see hearing that in that
[1:53:27] place he goes on he says I wrote in
[1:53:31] verse 9 I wrote unto you in an epistle
[1:53:35] not to company with fornicators yet not
[1:53:42] altogether with the fornicators of this
[1:53:44] world or with the covetous or
[1:53:46] extortioners or with idolaters for then
[1:53:50] you needs go out of of the world but now
[1:53:57] I've written unto you not to keep
[1:53:58] company you know what company is
[1:54:01] fellowship that's the definition
[1:54:05] intimate discourse that which would
[1:54:10] cause continuance as though all things
[1:54:13] are ok this is what this is what the
[1:54:17] word says in Matthew chapter 18 Matthew
[1:54:23] chapter 18 the prophet in this quote I'm
[1:54:26] reading out of Christ as the mystery the
[1:54:28] Rev says you have tapes on discipline in
[1:54:33] the church
[1:54:35] Matthew 18 if there is something he said
[1:54:41] you go to your brother if your brother
[1:54:42] hath aught against you you go to your
[1:54:44] brother right a your brother will not
[1:54:48] hear you here means neglects hears that
[1:54:51] a miss doesn't take the value of it then
[1:54:55] what does it say go and take witnesses
[1:54:58] with you y'all believe this don't you
[1:55:02] we're talking about keeping deity in our
[1:55:05] midst
[1:55:07] any if they neglect to hear brother
[1:55:10] Brent says take the Deacons or you say
[1:55:12] I'm going to get my pastor and we're
[1:55:14] going to sit down and if they neglect to
[1:55:16] hear them then tell it before the church
[1:55:19] and if they neglect to hear the church
[1:55:22] let them be unto thee as or what heathen
[1:55:29] and a publican I don't got my eyes on
[1:55:36] right now I'm talking about these things
[1:55:38] so I can't see your faces I'm talking
[1:55:42] about the deity of Jesus Christ that's
[1:55:45] what I'm talking about notice it said
[1:55:49] let them be as job said thou speakest as
[1:55:53] are you with me he separated them as
[1:55:57] sheep from goats there wasn't she there
[1:56:00] it was as she from goats the ass as was
[1:56:03] very important as as the heathen in
[1:56:06] public
[1:56:07] what's the publican Republican was one
[1:56:10] who was a Jew tax collector and they
[1:56:14] were mixing around with the Romans and
[1:56:15] they weren't living up to the standard
[1:56:17] of which they were born to that's the
[1:56:22] definition they weren't living to the
[1:56:24] standard they weren't living that out
[1:56:26] and said let him be under be as a
[1:56:30] heathen and a publican the prophet takes
[1:56:33] that with this right here and the
[1:56:37] Prophet brings it right down to this
[1:56:38] place right here when we just read is in
[1:56:41] verse 5 to deliver such a one unto Satan
[1:56:43] for the destruction of flesh that the
[1:56:44] spirit may be saved in the day of the
[1:56:46] Lord Jesus the prophet brings
[1:56:48] those two together this is Paul applying
[1:56:50] the word he's not playing and out of
[1:56:54] malice he's not playing and out of hate
[1:56:58] this is love you see love and compassion
[1:57:03] there is a love that enlarges the gates
[1:57:05] of hell there's a love that enlarges the
[1:57:10] gates of hell and there's a love that
[1:57:12] can deliver you from her steps the Bible
[1:57:16] says in the book of Proverbs they said
[1:57:17] many mighty men have went into her
[1:57:20] chamber and down her steps and they have
[1:57:24] been overcome but hearing the words of
[1:57:28] wisdom delivers you there right well
[1:57:34] what is Paul dealing Paul's let them
[1:57:35] know the deity is not where it needs to
[1:57:40] be in your midst this must be addressed
[1:57:44] let me just pause right here
[1:57:46] okay let me read you a quote sister
[1:57:49] don't don't try to find it I've got it
[1:57:50] here
[1:57:51] later in latter part in Hebrews chapter
[1:57:54] seven part one each member of the church
[1:57:58] is supposed to do that he's talking
[1:58:00] about all wars are fought for principles
[1:58:03] if you have a little war in church it
[1:58:05] must be the right principle you must be
[1:58:06] fighting for the right thing and each
[1:58:08] member of the church is supposed to do
[1:58:10] that
[1:58:10] this teaching is for the church these
[1:58:13] are these tapes he's talking about for
[1:58:14] discipline he lays this out and why
[1:58:17] we're not a denomination as well that's
[1:58:19] what I'm standing here for that's what
[1:58:21] God's Word is for it is for the church
[1:58:23] listen now listen don't never let
[1:58:25] nothing hinder this church if it does
[1:58:28] you're guilty each one of you this has
[1:58:34] got to be personal for every one person
[1:58:39] for every one if something comes into my
[1:58:42] home I take it personal if there's a
[1:58:45] need that's going on in my home I take
[1:58:47] it personal it's personal it may not be
[1:58:51] something I'm feeling or directly me but
[1:58:54] it's in the home and you and your
[1:58:59] different churches listen now
[1:59:01] if something is going wrong in your
[1:59:03] church you're guilty because you're the
[1:59:05] overseer of that church in ain't up to
[1:59:08] the pastor and ain't up to the Deacon
[1:59:09] board talking about holding up the hands
[1:59:13] of the pastor y'all still with me I'll
[1:59:21] still ready to hold up them hands in the
[1:59:23] pastor so we're all this isn't that Paul
[1:59:30] was letting them know when you all are
[1:59:32] gathered together this is body this is
[1:59:36] what Paul Ciolino here that same spirit
[1:59:38] right here when the Prophet is
[1:59:39] delivering this he says he goes in to
[1:59:42] say that that we're all responsible so
[1:59:44] when Paul is dealing with this he says
[1:59:47] in verse 11 I have written unto you not
[1:59:49] to keep company if any men that's called
[1:59:51] a brother be a fornicator covetous
[1:59:53] idolaters that's one of causing
[1:59:57] all sorts of stuff a drunkard or an
[1:59:59] extortioner with such a one what's it
[2:00:02] say what's it say with such a one do
[2:00:09] what not to eat that's mean are we
[2:00:18] looking at the word or not or are we
[2:00:21] looking at our feelings
[2:00:23] remember compassion that's just human
[2:00:26] compassion is the biggest hindrance
[2:00:31] earthly human pity is the biggest
[2:00:34] hindrance you with me it's got to come
[2:00:38] in line with God's will when it comes in
[2:00:42] line with God's will then God will move
[2:00:44] now let's just let's just clear the air
[2:00:48] on verse 11 a little bit can we do that
[2:00:52] that's okay I'll just left that
[2:00:54] hopefully the Lord let me let me go on
[2:00:56] and have some time
[2:01:01] the prophetic eyes that on earth take
[2:01:04] this in verse 11 and takes us in the
[2:01:06] message while we're not a denomination
[2:01:08] to the pastor by the name of brother
[2:01:10] Rasmussen and brother Rasmussen had a
[2:01:14] boy by the name of Wesley Wesley what an
[2:01:19] fornicator covenants idolaters
[2:01:21] maybe would have failing there
[2:01:24] but I want the drunkard or an
[2:01:25] extortioner but you know what he did he
[2:01:28] called his daddy's church a bunch of
[2:01:30] holy rollers and his daddy told him he
[2:01:33] said listen I love you and you're my
[2:01:36] daddy brother Brandon goes right through
[2:01:38] in the message he said I love you I'm
[2:01:41] your daddy
[2:01:42] he said but I will not compromise and
[2:01:44] allow you to talk about God's people
[2:01:46] that way so he said you making me choose
[2:01:49] between that and God's people and God's
[2:01:51] Word I'll stand with God's Word no he
[2:01:55] said it hurts me though it breaks my
[2:01:58] heart he said but I'll stand with God's
[2:01:59] Word Wesley he gave him a period of time
[2:02:05] he didn't get right now either said
[2:02:08] bunch of holy rollers go down there
[2:02:12] aren't you glad the Spirit of God showed
[2:02:14] us how to bring the application so he
[2:02:18] wouldn't come brother Rasmussen
[2:02:22] delivered and said this is it the brem
[2:02:27] said it wasn't until weeks months later
[2:02:31] Wesley took sick he got real sick at the
[2:02:35] point of death why because he had been
[2:02:39] released from under the protection of
[2:02:41] the blood the Prophet said as long as
[2:02:43] people are under the protection of the
[2:02:45] blood God can't deal with them listen to
[2:02:49] me the first part if you know your
[2:02:52] brother has a nought you go to him what
[2:02:53] is that that's the word God in flesh
[2:02:56] going you with me that's the mercy of
[2:02:59] God the mercy of God is the God to come
[2:03:01] down into flesh is that right
[2:03:02] God to operate in that way it won't hear
[2:03:04] you take more of God in flesh and go
[2:03:10] neglects to hear that bring the Assembly
[2:03:14] God moving through flesh there and for
[2:03:17] an agreed let's to hear that and God
[2:03:18] said because they will not take it from
[2:03:20] the veil then I take over when Wesley
[2:03:29] stood up before the church he apologized
[2:03:32] to the whole church he repented for his
[2:03:34] behavior he repented he said I shamed my
[2:03:37] daddy as a pastor I shamed Escarra
[2:03:39] Gatien I shamed the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:03:41] he's I'm asking you all to forgive me
[2:03:43] you see there had been a call to go in
[2:03:45] he was at the point of death he was at
[2:03:48] the point of death what was it God was
[2:03:50] dealing with his life now one of his
[2:03:53] daddy what if everybody from the church
[2:03:55] was a whole Wesley Wesley we want to
[2:03:58] have you back here so back if they
[2:03:59] wanted to have him back here so bad then
[2:04:01] they need to follow the letter of the
[2:04:02] word have no fellowship is this the word
[2:04:09] or not half don't don't eat now this
[2:04:14] situation here Paul dealt with it also
[2:04:17] not the same extremity of it but in 1st
[2:04:20] Thessalonians 5 there was one Paul said
[2:04:23] it was walking disorderly among the
[2:04:26] people paul said anybody that walks
[2:04:28] disorderly in other words they're a
[2:04:29] busybody we're such a 1 don't eat that's
[2:04:38] me no we're not talking about secular
[2:04:41] understanding now we're talking about
[2:04:43] the Word of God we're talking about what
[2:04:45] Paul is pointing them to as a desire if
[2:04:47] you're desiring to see as he's letting
[2:04:49] them know they're you're desiring to see
[2:04:51] this situation resolved you gotta come
[2:04:53] according to the word and your feelings
[2:04:56] and all of your compassion and pity has
[2:04:59] got to be brought under the word do you
[2:05:05] think those people didn't feel sorry for
[2:05:06] this young man and feel sorry for the
[2:05:08] situation sure they did sure they did or
[2:05:12] what's been down through the time and
[2:05:14] the ages sure they did it wasn't that
[2:05:16] they didn't but Paul is letting them
[2:05:18] know the deity of God you're at risk of
[2:05:22] it being removed from your mitts
[2:05:25] this is where the Prophet tells us he
[2:05:29] said we are trying to do it on our own
[2:05:32] so much and what he was pointing to is
[2:05:35] how there were people in that brother
[2:05:37] Brown was pointing this out he said
[2:05:39] we're not like the denominations he's
[2:05:40] the denominations get to looking at
[2:05:42] somebody saying you know what you'd be
[2:05:43] better over so and so's Church you'll be
[2:05:46] better over so and so's Church you make
[2:05:47] he says like this you make a good better
[2:05:48] Lutheran you make a better Baptists you
[2:05:51] make a better this that's what the
[2:05:53] Prophet is saying he's a but see the
[2:05:55] Scriptures looks at a situation to where
[2:05:57] God's able to move in and when the
[2:06:00] protection of the blood is removed then
[2:06:03] he said God can go to work couldn't God
[2:06:07] go to work before sure he has there's
[2:06:09] like you and me coming one to another
[2:06:11] even right here by the words coming
[2:06:12] forth to work God Himself coming right
[2:06:14] down here in flesh and speak into our
[2:06:16] lives and us one to another maybe I'll
[2:06:18] fellowship me you say brother I don't
[2:06:19] know about that or sister I don't know
[2:06:21] about sister you may you know coming to
[2:06:22] side sister I don't know maybe about
[2:06:24] this and you know how this is dress and
[2:06:26] how this is what is that
[2:06:28] that's the mercy of God moving down in
[2:06:31] reverence not just a simple little stick
[2:06:33] but it's looking at the rod of God
[2:06:36] there's a lot more depth through this
[2:06:39] here but I don't we can week week we can
[2:06:42] hit some of the other parts I'm holding
[2:06:44] up the pastor's hands but these are
[2:06:48] things that I want you to understand
[2:06:51] very clearly I want you to see it in
[2:06:53] leadership and know how to direct know
[2:06:57] how to walk know how to handle know how
[2:07:00] to move within something does heart
[2:07:02] itself as Paul is bringing this out here
[2:07:04] at that heart notice as he goes on verse
[2:07:07] 12 let me finish the chapter for what
[2:07:08] have I to do to judge them also that are
[2:07:11] without do not ye judge them that are
[2:07:13] within but them that are without God
[2:07:16] judgeth therefore put away from among
[2:07:18] yourselves that wicked person that
[2:07:21] sounds like Paul wicked person remember
[2:07:27] remember he's discerning the spirit from
[2:07:32] the individual
[2:07:35] that's where it takes the discernment is
[2:07:38] this all is being done - for what what
[2:07:42] did Paul say the destruction of the
[2:07:44] flesh that the spirit may be saved looks
[2:07:52] like I was sharing with some if my boys
[2:07:55] went you know my dad boy I tell you he'd
[2:07:58] tan my hide good many times not many
[2:08:01] times a lot and the thing that I didn't
[2:08:08] I what I didn't like more what I didn't
[2:08:12] like was the nap he made me take after
[2:08:15] it hated wasting daylight
[2:08:18] I hated that worse than I did the
[2:08:22] whippin was the remove one having to go
[2:08:25] lay down in the bed and go to sleep
[2:08:26] that's gonna miss playtime now give
[2:08:31] anything for them weapons right now but
[2:08:38] I know one thing that just like even
[2:08:40] with my boys my dad sometimes he would
[2:08:46] be over the house he told my wife he
[2:08:47] said you know how to take fall or bend
[2:08:50] take him holding room I come out you
[2:08:54] know because I don't just I never just
[2:08:56] spanked him we talked
[2:09:05] told him how important this is where
[2:09:07] this is where the standards that got
[2:09:08] thrown this even before and after of
[2:09:10] course I didn't do all of a lot of that
[2:09:12] when they were really young because they
[2:09:14] probably would fall asleep but by the
[2:09:18] time I come out the room my dad be gone
[2:09:20] I didn't even get to drink the rest the
[2:09:25] coffee with him dad tell my wife you
[2:09:26] said huh I can't stand around here for
[2:09:29] this what changed what changed times
[2:09:40] he'd be over there you know when we were
[2:09:41] training the boys with certain things
[2:09:43] you know and and there's a certain time
[2:09:45] of life you know and they're getting out
[2:09:47] of certain pants and into other pants
[2:09:49] you were mom and dads I had an accident
[2:09:53] he said Pat just wash this stuff up the
[2:09:56] youth meeting still gonna be going on
[2:09:57] wash it up don't and don't you say
[2:09:59] nothing to Sammy but I say all of that
[2:10:06] within this I know that sometimes not
[2:10:10] sometimes many times dad would do that
[2:10:14] looking the other way I know it got him
[2:10:19] but I know one thing deep down he knew
[2:10:23] that after this correction is over one
[2:10:25] thing about it I'll be able to enjoy him
[2:10:28] in my house I'll be able to take him out
[2:10:31] when Kim and them let him stay here with
[2:10:33] us
[2:10:34] I'll be able to take him out and if I go
[2:10:35] to snap my finger like I did for Samuel
[2:10:37] dad had a snap about him it was
[2:10:40] different by the dominating anybody
[2:10:41] snapped it was like a certain sound I
[2:10:43] knew what that snap meant that snap
[2:10:45] meant whatever you're doing it's wrong
[2:10:47] just stop and I also knew when we get in
[2:10:52] the car from where we're visiting you
[2:10:55] will be getting talked to and the
[2:10:57] possibility brother Joey was gonna be
[2:10:59] we'll talk about this we get home
[2:11:01] further
[2:11:01] I like fellowship but I never liked that
[2:11:04] fellowship that created a lot of
[2:11:06] anxiousness I say that with this when
[2:11:14] you look at this employers dealing with
[2:11:15] these things here like this Paul
[2:11:18] realizes
[2:11:19] he's letting the church know within it
[2:11:20] he's telling them how to direct their
[2:11:22] Compassion's within it so that their
[2:11:25] Compassion's don't hinder the working of
[2:11:29] the Lord he's not saying things to be
[2:11:35] mean things to being different
[2:11:41] this will never fit with dr. Spock this
[2:11:45] doesn't fit with New Age parenting
[2:11:52] but with the deity of Jesus Christ in it
[2:11:55] it still is all powerful the Word of God
[2:12:01] still prevails the life of Jesus Christ
[2:12:08] is going on the character of Jesus
[2:12:12] Christ is going on now what if these
[2:12:15] brothers and sisters maybe they had they
[2:12:17] were working with this individual what
[2:12:21] if they ran into this individual down in
[2:12:24] the marketplace they could look and say
[2:12:26] brother or they could say sister it's
[2:12:30] your heart right with God get your life
[2:12:35] turned around with Misha get your life
[2:12:39] turned around with God raptures upon us
[2:12:42] the coming of the Lord is upon us
[2:12:46] serious about these things not rather
[2:12:50] we're having steak tonight would you
[2:12:51] like to come over sister we're having
[2:12:53] chicken tonight would you like to come
[2:12:54] over hey we're all going to be getting
[2:12:56] together for a big fellowship dinner
[2:12:57] would you no no they were applying the
[2:13:00] word keep not company eat not with one
[2:13:05] why it was the love of God but to the
[2:13:09] minds of the world that's cruel that's
[2:13:13] indifferent but there's a purpose
[2:13:15] there's a war that's being fought with
[2:13:18] real principles with a real objective
[2:13:21] what is it
[2:13:23] Abram going after lot is that right and
[2:13:28] the Prophet says when you deliver and
[2:13:32] turn that over and loose from under the
[2:13:35] protection of the blood then God can go
[2:13:39] to work you said it can be a day two
[2:13:42] days week two weeks months however long
[2:13:45] let me tell you something friends let me
[2:13:47] listen to me clearly God did not give
[2:13:51] this to the church so that they would
[2:13:54] look at it and beat debilitated by
[2:13:58] what's happened
[2:13:59] you understand me the greatest thing
[2:14:02] Paul's letting them know this is
[2:14:04] committed into the hands of God God has
[2:14:07] worked through your flesh got his work
[2:14:09] through all of your encouragement God
[2:14:11] has worked through your words of
[2:14:12] admonition now it's completely in the
[2:14:14] hands of God and there's no better hand
[2:14:17] than the hands of God that's where Paul
[2:14:20] is letting them rest that's what gives
[2:14:21] them strength within it because they
[2:14:23] know it's resting in the deity of
[2:14:27] Almighty God it's resting there residing
[2:14:31] there you love him oh my praise the name
[2:14:39] of the Lord you pray for me these things
[2:14:44] right here that God has brought out with
[2:14:45] I didn't even get very far within that
[2:14:47] quote but maybe read it you most of you
[2:14:50] we know this quote by heart but there's
[2:14:52] things that just was standing out to me
[2:14:54] so great I couldn't get away from every
[2:14:57] little bit I had yesterday sneaking
[2:14:59] around looking at things putting over
[2:15:01] here looking at things we're here
[2:15:02] reading over here because these are the
[2:15:08] holding up of the hands of the pastor
[2:15:11] what's holding up the hands of the
[2:15:13] pastor is letting Christ have pre a
[2:15:15] minute letting the word have its effect
[2:15:21] your loving brother Bannerman that quote
[2:15:24] he didn't say hold up my hands but
[2:15:26] holding up at the hands of the pastor
[2:15:28] the pastor but the never was bringing
[2:15:30] that same bill around say he's preaching
[2:15:31] the same message so what is it it's
[2:15:33] holding up that hands and as that word
[2:15:35] is going forth
[2:15:36] hey that word is going to produce the
[2:15:39] word is going to produce the word
[2:15:43] transforms hallelujah in that the truth
[2:15:47] the word transforms can't you see that's
[2:15:50] why Satan wants to hinder not working
[2:15:54] and that's why we always have such a
[2:15:57] clarity and discerning from Satan your
[2:16:01] discerning not my brother it's not my
[2:16:03] sister it's the enemy if we can have
[2:16:06] that kind of a sharpener sharpening of
[2:16:09] discernment then it doesn't allow any
[2:16:11] place within us for there to be a seed
[2:16:14] to reside you see what I mean because we
[2:16:17] keep our ground of a certain asset level
[2:16:19] to where bitterness can't reside oh my I
[2:16:24] know I've really taken some time there
[2:16:26] this morning I love you I've truly
[2:16:32] delivered my soul my heart's delivered I
[2:16:38] still have more but these things listen
[2:16:41] friends you know I'm not here to take
[2:16:42] your time I'm not here to waste time I
[2:16:45] don't even intend to go these long in
[2:16:47] these services I have oh I have a timer
[2:16:48] up here I don't intend to take your time
[2:16:50] I'm not here to waste time and here to
[2:16:52] feel time I'm not here to just say
[2:16:54] things my heart's desire is God I want
[2:16:59] to say there's a lot of things I could
[2:17:00] say so a lot of things I can Minister
[2:17:02] I'd say that by His grace there's a lot
[2:17:04] of things I can look at but God what is
[2:17:06] it that we need I tell you what right
[2:17:13] now these are precious things that God
[2:17:15] that spoke to us that rod it's not a
[2:17:19] simple little stick no sure this is the
[2:17:23] rod of God the deity in the name
[2:17:30] of Jesus Christ but you love him I love
[2:17:41] him I love him because he first loved me
[2:18:06] [Music]
[2:18:08] [Applause]
[2:18:08] [Music]
[2:18:10] honk
[2:18:12] [Music]
[2:18:17] Stream love hi love him because he first
[2:18:38] loved me
[2:18:44] [Music]
[2:18:46] jazz mine
[2:18:50] [Music]
[2:18:56] [Music]
[2:19:23] maybe in your heart your life feel like
[2:19:27] Moses you feel like those hands are a
[2:19:28] little heavy but remember this God takes
[2:19:34] us this morning and he would ask Moses
[2:19:38] this what is this what is that
[2:19:42] in thine hand examine what's in your
[2:19:46] hand
[2:19:47] the Holy Spirit has directed us this
[2:19:50] morning to examine what's in our hand to
[2:19:55] look at it
[2:19:58] if it's just a rod
[2:20:02] let the deity of God come down say Lord
[2:20:08] take my life
[2:20:11] as a surrendered vessel or team
[2:20:14] take the words that are then caring and
[2:20:18] holding Lord in my heart the promise
[2:20:23] Colet the deity of God come down coming
[2:20:28] to the name of Jesus Christ
[2:20:33] for need in your life maybe sickness in
[2:20:37] your body
[2:20:40] maybe in your spirit maybe in your mind
[2:20:43] you trouble
[2:20:48] maybe a test or trial that you're in the
[2:20:50] midst of right now and it seems so great
[2:20:53] remember Moses was up against the Reds
[2:20:59] but he was up against that red sea speak
[2:21:06] to that water speak that the children
[2:21:08] before he raised his hand
[2:21:10] here the judgment rod of golf there was
[2:21:13] a time and a need where the serpents
[2:21:17] came among the people when they begin to
[2:21:19] moan and complain
[2:21:23] God had him reason down of a brazen
[2:21:25] serpent on that judgement rod
[2:21:28] recognizing sin already judge all that
[2:21:31] the people were commanded to do by faith
[2:21:33] is to look at
[2:21:37] to know that right here this morning
[2:21:43] that if your hands are heavy know that
[2:21:47] God can give you the strength and grace
[2:21:49] that you and me need of if you need help
[2:21:52] you say Lord ah I really want to live an
[2:21:54] overcoming life let let him let him take
[2:21:57] hold of all of your doings and let him
[2:22:01] exalt his word in your life let him move
[2:22:05] with that great simpleness yet
[2:22:09] sovereignty and power of his spirit if
[2:22:14] you look hands are heavy tests to trial
[2:22:17] under burden but yet yet let God say
[2:22:21] Lord I cast all my cares upon your Lord
[2:22:25] before you care for me rest upon that
[2:22:30] stone let the very presence of God
[2:22:34] raising giving you strength to rise up
[2:22:41] maybe you've been living beneath your
[2:22:43] privileges allowing things to collect in
[2:22:49] your life allowing things to hold over
[2:22:51] in your life and hinder you the right
[2:22:55] now you recognize that what is in your
[2:22:58] hand that rod in that rod the deity

[2:23:24] morning well I'm not talking about where
[2:23:27] you will necessarily feel like jumping
[2:23:30] out of here and running out of here but
[2:23:32] I'm talking about even where you make a
[2:23:34] step it may not be a physical step it
[2:23:36] can be a step right in your mind a step
[2:23:39] with your heart to say Lord I can't

[2:23:46] hear the voice of God speaking to you

[2:24:19] you would lift up your hand in defiance
[2:24:21] to gravity and lift it up before
[2:24:25] Almighty God where you would go beyond
[2:24:27] even that of reasoning and you would
[2:24:30] surrender your will to his will and say
[2:24:32] Lord Jesus for this need in my life nor
[2:24:36] that request let the deity come Lord God
[2:24:42] your presence Lord your spirit move down

[2:25:09] if they had need of healing in their
[2:25:11] body asked him Lord if they could lift
[2:25:14] their hands Lord and he likened that

[2:39:57] [Music]
[2:40:10] [Music]
[2:40:13] we're being dismissed I want to just
[2:40:15] just pass a little few things up to you
[2:40:18] along to you it would be something that
[2:40:21] would be very fitting even during a
[2:40:22] prayer meeting to mention but there was
[2:40:25] a report that where a meteorologist was
[2:40:30] looking at that hurricane that had come
[2:40:36] up through there and the meteorologists
[2:40:40] giving the report
[2:40:42] I've got her here on one of my on one of
[2:40:44] my apps but the Jason shared it with me
[2:40:47] the meteorologist made a statement they
[2:40:51] said this went from the greatest
[2:40:54] category of storm to the lowest category
[2:40:57] of storm this is a meteorologist on air
[2:41:00] he said there's no way to describe this
[2:41:02] happening other than the people of God
[2:41:06] were praying
[2:41:09] [Applause]
[2:41:17] it's true there's a lot of it was a lot
[2:41:19] of destruction a lot of people that
[2:41:21] there's been lives that were lost and we
[2:41:23] were saddened by that and there's a lot
[2:41:27] of things that probably some of you have
[2:41:28] relatives that were touched maybe you
[2:41:32] know in greater ways than maybe for
[2:41:33] others and I I know that you know even
[2:41:36] they had one that was coming and Jose
[2:41:38] but Jose is turned up and and it's
[2:41:42] always interesting these names we were
[2:41:43] talking about that last week but you
[2:41:48] know there's another one that that is
[2:41:50] out there forming but let's remember
[2:41:52] let's remember each and every one in
[2:41:57] prayer sometimes we're not feeling the
[2:41:59] effects maybe of something like that but
[2:42:02] we've got there's brothers and sisters
[2:42:04] there's loved ones there's people and
[2:42:06] listen friends whether they're you know
[2:42:08] you don't want to see lives lost we
[2:42:10] don't want to see people if we have the
[2:42:13] attitude even though we know we know
[2:42:15] that these things coming out spiraling
[2:42:19] like it is the earthquake that took
[2:42:22] place last week in Mexico on the LA
[2:42:25] Times I was following it where they are
[2:42:28] troubled they're waiting at any moment
[2:42:31] for what they term the big winner but
[2:42:34] what they don't know is is that you're
[2:42:36] not gonna escape the big one the Prophet
[2:42:40] told us in thinking man's filter I
[2:42:41] showed a so there your men on this on on
[2:42:44] on Friday night waves will splash clear
[2:42:48] back to Kentucky Phoenix will be a seat
[2:42:53] board
[2:43:04] thank God for the way of escape that's
[2:43:06] been made it's not just about the
[2:43:09] destruction when we're not interested
[2:43:10] it's done about discrete remember God
[2:43:13] God didn't come down the age of talking
[2:43:15] about destruction and the destruction
[2:43:18] was impending but he was let him know
[2:43:19] come that's worship see it was a call to
[2:43:23] worship amen
[2:43:26] we're going home because we love him we
[2:43:30] love his appearing he has appeared to us
[2:43:34] we love him and that's why we want to be
[2:43:37] with him our heart longs to be with him
[2:43:39] though across a span of time and others
[2:43:43] can look at your life like they did the
[2:43:45] young man going to school in Rome and
[2:43:46] say what's different about you I noticed
[2:43:49] the other people they they say they're
[2:43:51] Christians but they go out and drink and
[2:43:53] they want to do this want to do that
[2:43:54] what's different about you what did that
[2:43:57] young man say he said you see what it is
[2:43:59] he said across the sea I promised a
[2:44:03] young lady
[2:44:05] that I'll return I'm gonna marry her
[2:44:10] she said in a certain state in a certain
[2:44:14] city in a certain house is a little girl
[2:44:17] that I promised and he said so I don't
[2:44:21] do those things because I love her and
[2:44:24] the Prophet said for us standing on this
[2:44:26] side we abstain from all those things
[2:44:29] why because we have to because we love
[2:44:32] him
[2:44:34] we've heard a sound that's far greater a
[2:44:38] music that's far greater like the
[2:44:40] captain you don't have to plug my ears
[2:44:42] or tie me to the post anymore I've heard
[2:44:45] something that's greener something
[2:44:48] that's more precious she loved him let's
