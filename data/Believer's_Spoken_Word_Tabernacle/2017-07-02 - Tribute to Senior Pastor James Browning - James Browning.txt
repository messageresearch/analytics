thy crate my Creator in the days of thy youth while the evil days come not nor the years draw nigh when thou shalt say I have no pleasure in them while the Sun or the light or the moon or the Stars be not darkened nor the clouds return after the rain in the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble and the strongmen shall bow themselves and the grinders cease because they are few those that look out of the windows be darkened and the door shall be shut in the streets when the sound of the grinding is low and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird and all the daughters of music shall be brought low also when they shall be afraid of that which is high and fears shall be in the way and the almond tree shall flourish and the grasshopper shall be a burden and desire shall fail because man goeth to his long home and the mourners go about the streets or ever the silver cord be loosed or the golden bowl be broken or the pitcher be broken at the fountain or the wheel broken at the cistern then shall the dust return to the earth as it was and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it amen let's just bow our heads in order prayer our Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we want to say we love you Lord you are so faithful Lord you're so merciful Lord O God you are our strength giver Lord all father I ever present help in the time of trouble Lord we love you Lord you're our salvation

your love in our hearts Lord God for truly Lord Jesus it's because of you Lord the Lord we can say Lord Jesus all is well Lauren we love your father we praise your mighty name Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen Amen may God bless you as you're being seated certainly want to say that I love and I appreciate each and every one of you I know he couldn't we couldn't call everyone here this morning as far as calling you by phone and everything but I know that you've heard by now that my beloved brother my dad my mom's husband our dad he's went on to his reward I don't know when he when he stepped on the other side I know he wasn't using a cane I don't believe he was shuffling I know he went shuffling but I'm thankful to God for the life that was lived here among us I turned into this parking lot here today as I'm coming down this road there's so many memories everywhere I look I don't just see my dad I see other brothers it's went on before I see brother al Copa when I turned into this I seen them standing brother Gomez sister Elia brother al my dad standing by that sign when the church was just purchased and what Thanksgiving it was for us to be able to have a place together you know I see I was able to see a little bit behind the scenes and know the dedication the desire that that my dad had in his heart that there would be a place for God's people to worship and you know when I look here in this scripture I just yesterday morning was there with brother and sister keener and we were there ministering in that funeral and that yesterday morning I I noticed that everything changed on me when I got up and got going and I thought why do I have two funeral texts why then when we got over to the hospital and we were sitting there waiting you know immediately I said no I could see the gravity of the situation and my heart I'm saying no no but I look at this scripture in Ecclesiastes 12 and I remember when brother browning my dad when he stood here on a New Year's Eve service and he read that first scripture there and then this is probably 10 years ago and he read that scripture and he says he said you know what the evil days are its old age he said because the things that you have as a year as a young person and not just young as far as in you know in your 20s but even thirties forties so forth you have strengths that can be yielded to the Lord you have a lot of things that you're able to do is you would yield yourself to the Lord and he he made a statement within that and he made a statement that night he says don't wish your life away but he said make it so that every day it's yielded for the Lord that he might have his way you know sometimes we we do we all we do we go through times in our life and we think well I just can't wait till we're done with this an hour then with this project or done but each and every day I I remember that night that stood out to me so much I just took that as a real counsel and so when I would go to start wanting to get through something I'd always think back and I'd hear that coming back to wait a minute enjoy each day look what what can be done for the Lord in that day you come Don down further here in this passage that that we read and you find in the latter parts where everything as far as within the day would seem to go on but yet it says no one no one has the strength to carry on in the things that normally would take place strong men bowing themselves music that should be heard it's just as though it's silenced and then it goes as though a silver cord as as a scripture said that when that silver cord be loosed it's like this on a chandelier where you have something that within this that if it were to fall there's a delicous there's it's delicate even when they're having the crystals around it but yet if that cord or any of those links would give way down it comes but you don't know when that link will give way you don't know when the when the glass will be broken none of us and we realize this have the promise of even the next moment or even tomorrow so it doesn't mean that we live our lives in fear because as we serve the Lord we serve Him because we love Him because He first loved us so our love and devotion is to him our desires to please him and to serve Him to make every moment every every moment every time count for the Lord and I thought you know where my dad so many times I would tease him if you don't mind I want to read this little scripture he some of you know he preached this from the scripture many times and that was out of first Timothy chapter 6 verse 12 he said fight the good fight of faith lay hold on eternal life whereunto thou art also called and has professed a good profession before many witnesses and I would tell Dad I said dad you've preached so many angles and parts out of that I don't know if I could ever minister out of it but yeah I would I would kind of tease him a little bit within it but what I knew is is that within any of our lives it must be by experience whether we're preaching with this voice or whether we're preaching with this voice it must be by experience and that was a life that truly it was by experience that was lived out I saw over the course of the time I looked back over thee well it was actually about an even 10 years ago or so and I just got back from Africa the second time and dad said Sonny said when you go back he said I'd like to go back with you because he's seen when I came back that time I had had a lot of meetings and he wanted to go and help me and dad always had a burden for the missions always had a burden for the missions and yet the last time I think that he went was when he went with you to the Philippines I believe and you know I was usually I was used to my dad being so strong where he planted his whole yard in grass and then got on a flight the next morning and went to Honduras to minister meetings and so for me you know one of the things and I know that some of you you saw it as well I was used to my dad always being so strong where it was just like he didn't wear down he just kept going he just kept going and you know I think back and and pawned that and I look back over the past years and ten years and even the past five years and I saw his steps get slower but yet dad always wanted to be in the house of God you'd like to aid him up last year when July when I had to put him in the car and we took him into the hospital you remember he couldn't come back here to the to church until October he had that whole situation he went through with his foot and how many times that we as a congregation some of you I understand are new and even from even a few years ago but throughout the time of how that God has miraculously moved for brother browning when he couldn't even I was a junior getting ready to become a senior and here he has a stroke I walk into his office that day he can't even talk there's nothing that is audible he can't move his right side at all and you witnessed and I witnessed God completely restore him I never forget when he ministered in Honduras and I was there in 1996 and he spoke the message at thy word Lord I'll let down the net and he was ministering and he came to a place the people had already been praying for him and they knew the condition he put a penny he had in his pocket out here and he put it with his left hand now and he in the midst of ministering he reached and he grabbed it and when he grabbed that and picked that up that whole place erupted it was just such a faith Bank came in there on that on that Friday night service I never forget that in my life it was all things were possible the people seen that they had been praying for it and there's many different things is even here in 1999 18 years ago in February when my dad was going in there was some complications that happened with his heart they had to rush him from Sandusky over to st. Vincent and his his lungs were filling up on the table well you know how when you're setting in a room and we're in a little room and all of a sudden a priest walks into this room I knew that that didn't mean good things but my memoir Browning my mom and myself were there my dad had been ministering on Thursday nights on a subject it is I be not afraid I don't know how many parts he had already spoke on it but we were praying there that night and I remember hearing the words come forth it is I'd be not afraid and you know how you have your brakes on the front of your trousers my mom remembers and on her dress it just Benton the dress and bent the bit my trousers in front right over it came from right here the prints of the Lord just moved right through there that priest sensed it and everything and then they came back all of a sudden here comes a doctor and doctor comes in and says hey it's all reversed it's all reversed and my dad asked me he said son he said where were you at from me I said well dad you remember I said we came in he'd like like towards you like this I said we were down in a little room I said on down that way he said that's the direction he came from he said there was a fog rolling in on me he said but he came to me and said your work is not finished yet you must stay God knows what he's doing Paul says in the scriptures for I'm not ready to be offered in the time of my departure is at hand Paul goes on to say I have I've fought a good fight of faith I finished my course I've kept the faith henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but unto all them also that love his appearing that very portion of word for I'm now ready to be offered even in that phrase it refers to that of a drink offering that's poured out which is a life that's a given and I I look at it over the times and is here I just had a little moment when I came back from the funeral yesterday my dad was at my house and he was sitting there on the couch I mentioned to him I said we were just talking about some things and he said I want to go down I want to see your basement I want to look around this okay so he came down and he's looking around he began to tell me you need to do this you need to do that so okay dad I said what is this stuff I need this is what you need son okay then I looked at him and I was so struck by different things I said dad I said I want to say this to you I said I want to say thank you for the testimony and the life the gospel that you preached I said the true standard of this message that you held that it wasn't a letter but it's the person of Jesus Christ I said I want to say thank you and I hugged him I didn't know there was the last moments as far as to be able to have that kind of a converse with him but what a consolation that we do have in the midst of our grief in the midst of our sorrow there's many lives that I can look out around through this assembly where God used as the Prophet said God will take the makeup of the messenger of the age to catch the people of the age that st. parallel works even in an assembly to see how that God Himself he here he took an individual that didn't beat around the bush he spoke straight and administered to a lot of people I see different lives around here that it was a life that was yielded to the Lord I I remember him driving from Salina three-and-a-half hours even for a midweek service if there was a need he would take off and go and then sometimes here was you know dad was usually up with me when I'm getting up for school in the morning but that particular morning because he got in real late you rest a little bit longer and then he would finally get it right before I got on the school bus but I what I've seen and what I witnessed and I say this to you what you've seen here is the same thing I've seen it on it was true throughout and that all glory belongs to the Lord you know I thought about it this morning when I finally got home and I thought about how the Prophet said how what he would give to have some more time with his dad I thought about different ones of you that's lost your loved one close loved ones I started going through my mind they had even a greater impact greater impact you know I can't say that I wouldn't want him to come back here because I miss him already but I don't want to be selfish because I know right now he's not suffering he's not asking for strenght and you know where I'm helping him get up out of the chair or anything and I know I have the utmost confidence according to the Word of God that there were already loved ones and saints of God that were gathered there at the river to welcome him home amen what it's a comfort within that the sámi was your heart broken it's broken absolutely for many of us you know especially for many that even had where it was even more even of a closeness gonna be our x i i know from my mother they they were best friends for me i told my boys today and they knew it i said my dad he wasn't just dad he was my buddy he was my buddy and I'm gonna miss him we're gonna miss him but you know by the grace of God soon and very soon we shall see him amen so I just I covered your prayers myself or the Giri a mom family we covered your prayers when everything would be made known with the arrangements for the service we'll get those out to you so that you would be aware of them but I want to say I love each and every one of you I appreciate you in the Lord there was no place even this morning when I talked with the Deacons right off the bat with everything that I'll be there this morning I said we will be there I said that's the way my dad would have had it and for me there's no other place to come to to see brothers and sisters of like precious faith in the midst of this time and just to be able to draw strength from one another I'm so thankful for the body of Jesus Christ I'm thankful for God's Amazing Grace and thankful for the message that God has sent to us in this hour that we might have a true pathway that is laid out before us a true reality a true face a true hope a blessed assurance I think God for His amazing grace praise be to the name of the Lord amen so we covered your prayers we love each and every one of you may God richly bless you is my prayer amen [Music] mmm-hmm I'd like to read a passage of scripture from Psalms 90 some 90 was wrote by Moses it was a prayer of Moses Lord thou has been our dwelling place in all generations before the mountains were brought forth or even thou had us formed the earth and the world even from everlasting to everlasting thou art God thou turnest man to destruction and saith return ye children of men for a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past and as a watch in the night thou carry us them away as a flood they are as asleep in the morning they are like grass which groweth up in the morning that flourish and growth up in the evening it is cut down and withereth for we are consumed by that in Europe and by thy wrath are we troubled thou has set our iniquities before the our secret sins in the light of thy countenance for all our days are passed away in thy wrath we spend art years as a tale that is told some years ago when we were in the building over on Gary Avenue my dad got up and read from this scripture and he said I know this sounds like a funeral service but he he took and said that from where it said that our lives are like grass grow with up in the morning and the evening it's is cut down it's withered then he went to the last verse I read to you it said we spend our years as a tale that is told and he said our ears it's like a book and what we do in our life is wrote in that book it's wrote by our life and he said whatever we we do it's in there but by the blood of Jesus Christ God erases the parts of our sin and he said the book starts out when we begin our lives even at birth he says and it goes through the pages of time and then there comes a time when the book is to be closed it's the last testimony that would be in it it has been lived and spoken and the book is closed and once it's closed nothing can be added to it nothing can be tooken away from it any minister dad and was trying to get across the point that people would look at their lives and would take count of their lives and what they were doing and how they were living in and what was going down in their book and knowing that there was gonna come a time when it'd be the last chapter the last paragraph the last sentence the last word and he was it was a message actually of salvation that he preached I remember I never forgot that service and when I moved to Tennessee I was there only a few months someone passed away and I had to preach the first funeral service I'd ever preached in my life and I used this text from what I'd heard my dad preached this work started in September of 1982 I was there the very first discussion that was made to have a service a meeting I was there when we decided that we would rent a room into why I was only 19 years old and I saw my dad stand against great adversity and he stood for truth even when it seemed like that there were so many that wouldn't stand with him but he held on and I believe it was his life his testimony his book this book to a lot of you brought you here I thought about what I spoke a week ago about brother Branham when he went beyond the curtain of time and he there was a many of them come saying my precious brother and there was one young woman in the angel said you know who that is said you let her to the Lord when she was 19 years old and I thought there are some did my dad led to the Lord this went on and they'll be there to meet him one of them people was his his very own dad and his mom he led them both to the Lord and I know they were there degree he said to me this week he said when the resurrection takes place he said it's like brother Branham said it's not a million miles away said we'll speed up and they'll slow down and he said him will will have a time here together but we won't be seen by the world I thought of a sister strange at a time somewhat that he was talking to me about they had just seemed to come up I hadn't been able to come up here for some time because of things that was involved with my family and I couldn't get away but when those things were resolved and I was free my family was free we begin to make plans while my wife and I had to come up to visit our families our folks and we had originally planned to come up earlier but I felt I needed a little more time because I wanted to make sure I had a good amount of money for the trip but I see now it was hauling God's hands and I'm thankful that he allowed me to spend this last week with my dad I'm thankful that I was there with my mom and my brother seems like there's been so many times that I wasn't able to be there because of living so far away but God was gracious to me this time [Applause] let's live our lives as a tell is told knowing that our life and our testimony lives on after we're gone and knowing that maybe many of us have loved ones and friends that are there waiting and we're looking forward to see them again and I believe I believe it's getting really close I believe it's very close my brothers and sisters I don't believe we got too much more time to wait and I'm looking forward to it I love you and I appreciate your love that you've had for my family and the respect that you had for my dad I want to thank you for your faithfulness yes please continue to mirror my family of prayers Heavenly Father Lord Jesus thou hast the words of eternal life Lord your prophet said eternal life was living for others and I know that's what we're the brownie did he lived for others not for himself Lord I'm thankful Lord that we've had the opportunity to have witnessed the life of this great warrior to had his samples lived before us thankful dear God for his zeal and fervency Lord to make sure there was a work established here lord I thank you for the revealed word that you spoke through him the years of teaching that I remember him laying down Lord God the foundation of teaching what I had my ministry is affected by the years I said under his ministry door hung I'm the product of his ministry did I thank you Lord for he was never a selfish individual when it comes to the ministry he always tried to help Lord he never felt intimidated or threatened by other ministries those around him but he reached how Lordan tried to encourage them Lord I can remember him Lord he never held anything back he passed on secrets of ministering and preaching to me Lord he taught me many things I know hope my brother could say the same Lord I asked how their God your blessing upon this people that have loved respected him for so many years lord I pray dear God that me Lord they take courage to continue to fight the good fight of faith to lay hold on eternal life hallelujah to finish the race we ask these things in
