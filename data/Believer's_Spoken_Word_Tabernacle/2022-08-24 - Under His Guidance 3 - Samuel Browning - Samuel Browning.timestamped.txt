[29:46] i just certainly just asked that you'd

[29:50] miss you i already miss you and i'm not
[29:51] even gone
[29:53] amen may god just come by and just just
[29:56] do something really special for us
[29:58] amen joshua chapter 5 verse 13.
[30:02] the scripture says and it came to pass
[30:05] when joshua was by jericho
[30:07] that he lifted up his eyes and looked
[30:10] and behold there stood a man over
[30:13] against him
[30:15] with his sword drawn in his hand
[30:19] and joshua went unto him and said unto
[30:21] him art thou for us
[30:23] or for our adversaries
[30:25] and he said nay
[30:27] but as captain of the host of the lord
[30:30] am i now come
[30:32] joshua fell on his face to the earth and
[30:35] did worship
[30:36] and said unto him
[30:38] what saith my lord
[30:40] unto his servant
[30:43] you know that's as we were looking at
[30:45] that last we can come to that point
[30:48] that's right there that's really where
[30:49] the battle was won
[30:52] there was the battle right there and it
[30:54] was one when joshua
[30:57] recognized who he was standing in the
[31:00] presence of
[31:02] and
[31:02] surrendered himself
[31:06] to the lord
[31:10] and the captain of the lord's host said
[31:12] unto joshua loose thy shoe from off thy
[31:15] foot for the place where on thou stand
[31:18] us is holy
[31:20] and joshua
[31:22] did so
[31:23] amen may god bless you and bless the
[31:25] reading of the word as you're being
[31:26] seated
[31:27] just like to
[31:29] continue on that thought on under his
[31:31] guidance
[31:33] knowing that every promise that god has
[31:36] given to us
[31:38] as paul could say as we are in christ is
[31:40] yea and amen
[31:42] there's no there's no uncertainty with
[31:44] the promise of god or any promise
[31:47] and there's nothing wrong with
[31:51] with any promise or anything wrong with
[31:53] god
[31:54] but always the battle
[31:56] is us getting ourselves out of the way
[32:00] so many times in in and this is
[32:02] something that it happens it's not just
[32:04] daily
[32:06] but it happens in many situations
[32:09] many things that sometimes that we can
[32:11] try to
[32:13] take the word of god and we can try to
[32:15] will a situation to happen
[32:18] and when
[32:19] and go we know god will never come and
[32:21] do that because it'll be
[32:23] that would be to our glory we don't
[32:25] sometimes see it in that way and we need
[32:27] god to help us to be able to see that
[32:29] it's not us willing something to be done
[32:32] but it's surrendering our will to his
[32:35] will
[32:36] because he it's him to come and perform
[32:39] his word in our life and i know we we
[32:42] hear of this and we we speak of it and
[32:44] there's been many examples that we have
[32:47] given to it you know even over the time
[32:49] and over the years but it's always
[32:50] something good to come back to that
[32:52] it's it's always about us getting our
[32:56] own selves out of the way
[32:58] and when you consider that this here of
[33:01] jericho and what was before them it was
[33:03] the first objective
[33:05] but you know with everything that god
[33:08] lets to be placed before us
[33:11] god's
[33:12] saying something through every
[33:13] experience
[33:15] and one of the very the very first
[33:17] experience they come through after
[33:20] crossing the jordan being circumcised
[33:23] partaking of the passover eating of the
[33:26] old corn of the land after this the very
[33:28] first thing they come to is jericho
[33:31] a situation that's before him that
[33:34] it it looks as though if you're looking
[33:36] at the walls and looking at everything
[33:38] joshua doesn't know how it's going to
[33:40] come to how how they're going to take
[33:42] that sitting
[33:43] but he he knows by the grace of god that
[33:47] god has said i've given you everything
[33:50] in this land
[33:52] it's been years since those words were
[33:54] even uttered think of even how that god
[33:56] would speak through abraham that they
[33:58] would dispossess the inhabitants of the
[34:00] land and then god sends his messenger
[34:03] down there with a message and and you
[34:05] know the the applying of the blood of
[34:07] the lamb and begins to make these
[34:09] promises real real clear to them that
[34:12] let them know i'm bringing you out of
[34:13] this land and we're going to take you in
[34:15] taking you into a land that's flowing
[34:17] with milk and honey and and every every
[34:20] place that your foot treads upon i've
[34:22] already given it to you
[34:24] and and and when we we recognize that
[34:27] within it joshua had that that strong
[34:29] consolation that god has already given
[34:33] us the this of jericho but he's looking
[34:36] at the obstacles of what's before him
[34:40] and and when it comes to it the real
[34:42] obstacle itself is not what we're
[34:44] looking at
[34:46] that's not really the obstacle but the
[34:48] obstacle itself that we find many times
[34:51] that is a lot stronger
[34:53] has within a lot of of a greater mortar
[34:56] than any walls of jericho that's our own
[34:59] thinking
[35:00] our own will many times is put together
[35:03] with a lot we've we have pieced things
[35:05] together and put it together in it and
[35:07] yet god brings us every situation that
[35:10] god brings us to and let me just say it
[35:12] like this even situations that we in
[35:16] ourselves have created
[35:19] yet even in that god still
[35:24] desires to make his glory and his power
[35:29] known to you and i
[35:31] and god takes that because we're not a
[35:33] people that is perfect in ourselves
[35:36] there's mistakes there's failures
[35:38] there's things that we can
[35:40] even as we could get in the flesh of
[35:43] looking at things but yet if we can come
[35:45] back and yield to god and say lord i
[35:49] don't know in this situation i'm just
[35:51] going to step back and i'm going to give
[35:53] it into your hands
[35:55] and the greatest the greatest victory
[35:57] there ever is is yielding our lives to
[36:00] the lord
[36:01] it's yielding every step of the way
[36:03] that's the greatest battle that we have
[36:06] and to think of within this when here
[36:09] god makes himself known to joshua the
[36:12] same
[36:13] god who veiled himself in the pillar of
[36:15] fire is now standing here
[36:18] before joshua
[36:20] as a man and he announces
[36:23] who he is i am come now for this purpose
[36:27] not that you would tell me what to do or
[36:30] how to do it but i'm come in this
[36:32] situation to lead you
[36:36] in this battle
[36:38] god already knew what was out before him
[36:41] but joshua going out before the walls of
[36:44] jericho looking at him can you think of
[36:47] what thoughts would have crossed through
[36:48] his mind because he was a man of like
[36:51] passion such as you and i
[36:53] that can look at situations and the
[36:55] thoughts that would come and joshua knew
[36:58] brother ram tells us like this joshua
[37:00] had built and worked with that type of
[37:04] thing even down in egypt he knew the
[37:06] strength of those walls
[37:08] he knew how thick they were if anybody
[37:11] could rehearse or know what he was up
[37:14] against joshua knew that but joshua in
[37:17] looking at those walls and all those
[37:20] thoughts that could be coming to him but
[37:22] yet in the midst of all of that there
[37:25] was here how god showed up and god
[37:28] announced i'm here to lead this battle
[37:32] you know there had to be something
[37:34] already before god even had showed up
[37:37] that let god know it's time to step down
[37:41] there is a heart that that desires to be
[37:44] led by god there's a life that desires
[37:48] to be like i believe that's our heart's
[37:50] desire we want to be led by god more
[37:52] than anything
[37:54] and god help me that if my will is in
[37:56] the way help me lord god that that could
[37:58] be identified then help me to surrender
[38:01] lord melt it down to where it can be
[38:04] your will that's stepping down
[38:08] in joshua he's now here he is once he
[38:10] recognizes who he's in the presence of
[38:13] he he now as he falls to the ground he
[38:16] begins to worship and the voice comes
[38:18] forth forth loosened by shoes because
[38:22] the ground where you are standing is
[38:24] holy ground
[38:25] that ground was like any other ground
[38:28] but what made it holy ground is because
[38:30] almighty god was standing there on that
[38:33] ground
[38:35] and he noticed that loosening of the
[38:37] shoes what god was announcing to joshua
[38:40] that anyway that you had any thought
[38:44] about this situation i want you to
[38:46] loosen yourself from that thought of how
[38:49] this is going to be done and you see
[38:51] when god you or i can look at that many
[38:54] times and we could say how do i do that
[38:56] it's simple in this regards when god
[39:00] has said loosen my shoe we can say lord
[39:04] i take liberty with what you have said
[39:07] and i loosen myself from these thoughts
[39:11] because it's not a natural thing that's
[39:14] taking place it's just like if i could
[39:16] say you know to brother bill i could say
[39:18] you know to brother drake or brother
[39:20] shane or brother gamer i could say to
[39:22] anybody you know sometimes when you
[39:23] could be down i could say well brother
[39:25] carlos don't be down well it's not it's
[39:28] not that that we couldn't say that but
[39:30] there's got to be something within that
[39:33] there's supernatural to direct it in
[39:36] order to move and to change that
[39:38] situation and when god has made a
[39:41] statement in his word when he says lay
[39:43] it aside lay aside every way lay aside
[39:47] everybody setting sin when god says
[39:49] loose thy shoe then there is an
[39:51] authority of almighty god that is there
[39:54] if we'll just heed to that and say lord
[39:57] i loose my shoes i loose my will i loose
[40:00] this unto you there is a supernatural
[40:04] presence of almighty god with an
[40:06] authority to loosen us from going our
[40:09] own way
[40:11] hallelujah i'm glad about that
[40:14] i'm glad about that because we need his
[40:18] loosening
[40:19] in our lives and with every situation
[40:22] coming in what a what a moment of
[40:24] reverence as as the shoes are are
[40:27] loosened and taken off and begin to look
[40:29] and to recognize who was there remember
[40:31] god told moses when moses came up there
[40:35] to the burning bush and he was attracted
[40:37] to that to that site because here was a
[40:40] bush that was on fire yet was not
[40:42] consumed
[40:44] it was a miracle it was a paradox and it
[40:47] attracted moses now notice what it did
[40:50] it didn't just get moses up there on the
[40:53] mountain but that was also signification
[40:57] that god was drawing moses beyond moses
[41:02] there had to be something greater than
[41:04] the natural because the first exodus
[41:07] took place with god leading moses in an
[41:10] exodus beyond his own will
[41:13] that was where the victory was won that
[41:15] was where everything every miracle that
[41:18] was ever done in egypt was because that
[41:20] moses came to that moment and recognized
[41:23] in the presence of god i'm helpless lord
[41:27] i can't do this lord i need you lord
[41:30] jesus we need your strength we need your
[41:33] guidance and recognizing who he's in the
[41:36] presence of if we can just recognize
[41:39] that the victory is already won if you
[41:43] recognize you're in the presence of the
[41:45] mighty god
[41:46] then the victory is already won i don't
[41:49] care what rises up where is the mighty
[41:52] god that's standing there before us
[41:55] and reverence ourselves to that loose
[41:57] and oh god loosen my will loosen my
[42:00] thoughts concerning this
[42:05] because when we're honest there's many
[42:07] times
[42:08] of thoughts and things that we can say
[42:12] it's not that we have a question with
[42:14] god
[42:15] sometimes it's the way and the approach
[42:18] sometimes we get in the way
[42:20] and sometimes the way that god lets us
[42:23] if god himself doesn't altogether let us
[42:26] know how it's all going to come about
[42:30] not one person in here not one of us
[42:33] not one of us would elect
[42:36] to have go through a trial
[42:38] our flesh would never our flesh would
[42:40] never never desire that because you know
[42:42] what a trial is where the flesh
[42:45] weakness is displayed
[42:48] but when weakness and you say well then
[42:50] if
[42:51] if through that weakness that's when
[42:54] deity is displayed how can that be
[42:56] because when weakness is surrendered to
[42:59] god and coming back and recognizing that
[43:02] god has this in control you know what
[43:05] that is that's called worship
[43:08] when you can say lord i don't know
[43:09] what's going on but i know you've got it
[43:11] in control that's worship
[43:13] you're worshiping him
[43:16] brother branham tells us when we're
[43:18] standing in a store or something and
[43:19] we're able to speak to someone and say
[43:22] hasn't the lord may given us a beautiful
[43:24] day that's worship
[43:27] worship is not limited to where when
[43:29] music is going on but worship is
[43:31] something daily out of our life it's
[43:34] giving praise to god and even in the
[43:36] midst of that remember when paul said
[43:38] when paul could not understand what was
[43:40] going on remember he prayed three times
[43:42] that you know that it would come and go
[43:45] with his eyes and what he was seeing and
[43:47] he prayed thrice
[43:48] and finally god let him know that paul
[43:52] this
[43:53] is is is is my i have permitted this to
[43:57] come about but in the midst of this i
[43:59] want you to know paul that even though
[44:02] you feel weaker
[44:04] actually it's in these times that i am
[44:07] the strongest in your life
[44:10] my goodness that is beyond our natural
[44:13] thinking about things
[44:15] every one of us like to feel like when
[44:17] we i mean everybody likes to next to
[44:19] have that feeling of like when you're on
[44:21] the mountaintop and you've got
[44:22] everything in control
[44:23] everybody likes to feel that
[44:26] because it's something that just kind of
[44:28] it is a comfort to us but the thing that
[44:30] is not as comfortable to us is when we
[44:34] don't feel like we got everything in
[44:36] control but if you can recognize that
[44:39] there is a god that even the things that
[44:41] you and i didn't even know about and
[44:43] know all these other all these other
[44:45] avenues but he's always in control of
[44:49] every situation
[44:50] and all he asks for you and i to do is
[44:52] is yield and to recognize that and when
[44:55] we can do that paul said i will glory in
[44:58] my infirmities paul was not walking
[45:00] around and saying praise god i can't see
[45:03] praise god this affliction's on me
[45:05] that's not what it was
[45:06] when that affliction came paul said i'm
[45:10] going to turn up my praise i'm going to
[45:12] worship god
[45:14] this is not going to control me now
[45:16] listen it doesn't mean that you know
[45:18] bubble dancing i believe in that but
[45:21] what it was paul said this is not i'm
[45:24] not going to let it get me down i'm
[45:26] going to worship and you know what it
[45:27] says i will glory that the power or the
[45:31] tent of christ might set up on my life
[45:38] our flesh don't feel like glorying in
[45:40] that
[45:41] but remember what not glorying in our
[45:43] infirmities
[45:45] we're glorying
[45:47] in
[45:48] the sovereign
[45:49] providence of the omniscient god
[45:53] who knows all things
[45:55] he is omnipotent he's working everything
[45:58] sometimes you can look or i can look and
[46:00] think why why am i going through this
[46:02] but you recognize god has a testimony
[46:06] in each of our life there's a testimony
[46:09] that god has to be able to to give
[46:12] witness to give testimony to give
[46:14] encouragement to think about how god
[46:16] would allow you and i to go through
[46:18] things in order to give a testimony and
[46:22] an experience and a help to everyone
[46:24] else
[46:25] you believe
[46:26] that jesus standing there remember in
[46:29] john 14
[46:31] and philip asked him said show us the
[46:33] father and that suffices that that'll
[46:35] that'll just that'll satisfy us
[46:37] and jesus when he speaks to him remember
[46:40] what he says
[46:41] he says how long have i been with you
[46:43] and you're asking me
[46:45] show us the father
[46:48] now what's he direct he's not
[46:50] notice where jesus here he is the word
[46:53] when there's a question it's a word
[46:55] question
[46:56] and notice what the word made flesh does
[46:59] it identifies itself by the word
[47:04] jesus could jesus has he unfolds this he
[47:08] he declares that that it's not the
[47:11] things that you're hearing it's not my
[47:14] words it's the father's words
[47:17] and it's not me that's doing the works
[47:19] it's my father that dwelleth in me
[47:22] he's the one that's doing the works
[47:25] and he's announcing then that you
[47:27] believe that you recognize that it's not
[47:30] me it's not a man this is not a natural
[47:33] thing but this is our heavenly father
[47:36] who's actually being declared and is
[47:39] right here among us why was he
[47:42] announcing that because when they can
[47:44] recognize that it is the almighty god
[47:47] that is standing present it stabilizes
[47:51] them that's what stabilizes you and i
[47:54] let me say something one thing we can
[47:56] pray about many times we can get into a
[47:58] place all we're doing is praying about
[48:00] this need and praying about this need
[48:02] i'm talking about even some of the same
[48:04] thing in our life and you know what you
[48:06] don't find you're getting anywhere you
[48:08] know why because we can't be focused on
[48:11] that we need to call him on the scene
[48:14] and ask god lord make yourself known
[48:20] you understand what i'm saying
[48:23] we keep we and these are times where
[48:25] even with prayer it isn't that we don't
[48:27] ask god lord that you would speak lord
[48:29] that you would die but we need him to
[48:31] come on the scene joshua went out there
[48:34] to know
[48:35] how are we going to take this battle and
[48:38] when he's going out there in that manner
[48:40] what joshua
[48:41] needs to see
[48:43] is that the same god is right there with
[48:47] them
[48:52] think of this in joshua chapter 6. i
[48:54] want to read this
[48:56] the bible said that jericho in verse 1
[48:58] of joshua 6 jericho was straightly shut
[49:00] up because of the children of israel
[49:02] none went out none came in
[49:04] and the lord said unto joshua see i have
[49:07] given into thine hand
[49:09] jericho
[49:10] and the king thereof and the mighty men
[49:12] of valor so i've given them into your
[49:15] hand now joshua already had the
[49:17] certainty knowing that that jericho is
[49:20] what god desired them to take
[49:23] but now god is speaking to joshua and
[49:26] letting him know
[49:27] i've given it in your hand every
[49:28] inhabitant of this city i put it into
[49:30] your hand and you shall compass the city
[49:33] all you men of war and go round about
[49:36] the city once and thus shalt thou do six
[49:38] days
[49:40] and seven priests shall bear before the
[49:43] ark seven trumpets of seven
[49:46] ram's horns and the seventh day you
[49:49] shall compass the city seven times and
[49:51] the priest shall blow with the trumpets
[49:54] and it shall come to pass that when they
[49:56] make a long blast with the ram's horn
[49:59] and when you hear the sound of the
[50:01] trumpet all the people shall shout with
[50:03] a great shout and the wall of the city
[50:06] shall fall down flat and the people
[50:09] shall ascend up every man straight
[50:12] before him
[50:15] think of a song that we sing in this
[50:17] very old song
[50:19] learning to lean
[50:22] learning to lean
[50:25] because in every situation
[50:28] every trial every test and everything
[50:30] that comes to us
[50:32] it's really coming to a place of
[50:33] learning to lean
[50:36] we can we can
[50:38] something can come and it can come
[50:40] before us and we can be vexed about it
[50:42] we can look at it
[50:45] but in that of all the vexation and
[50:48] looking at all that
[50:50] has to come back to a place to say
[50:53] lord
[50:54] i'm going to trust in you lord
[50:58] it's learning to lean upon him
[51:02] and we know as we grow in the lord that
[51:05] doesn't become less
[51:07] it becomes more
[51:09] the closer we get to him the more that
[51:11] we recognize
[51:13] our insufficiency
[51:16] it's getting close to him and we
[51:18] recognize our need for more of him in
[51:21] need of his leadership this is why paul
[51:23] when he would write in the scriptures
[51:26] let this mind be in you which was also
[51:30] in christ jesus let this mind be in you
[51:32] now you know when you have when you have
[51:35] been born again of the spirit of god you
[51:38] have received the mind of christ
[51:41] you have received that in your soul
[51:44] but we recognize that that is something
[51:48] that each day each moment of our life we
[51:51] have to let the mind of christ let him
[51:54] have preeminence we have to allow him to
[51:57] have the first place he has the first
[52:00] place but we have to let him have it
[52:04] every time that we've repented it's
[52:05] because we haven't let him have first
[52:07] place
[52:08] and you know there's something listen
[52:10] there's things that make it easier
[52:12] because let me say this just in case you
[52:14] don't know this thing has not been
[52:16] redeemed yet this thing this thing
[52:19] doesn't want to read this doesn't want
[52:20] to pray this doesn't want to listen to
[52:22] the message it does not want to do those
[52:24] things this is not saved
[52:27] no matter how long you've been serving
[52:28] god it doesn't matter it doesn't all of
[52:30] a sudden become easier
[52:34] but now the battle what you recognize as
[52:36] a mature believer is is that this thing
[52:39] i cannot allow this to rain because it
[52:42] takes me away from contact with god to
[52:45] where that the mind of christ is not
[52:48] operating as it should be it didn't mean
[52:50] you're gonna because when you've been
[52:51] born again you're not gonna go live in
[52:52] sin there's a there's one on the control
[52:55] tower there's no desire for sin but you
[52:57] see what happens is is putting ourselves
[52:59] in a situation that the mind of christ
[53:02] can have preeminence in our life that's
[53:04] why we're reading the word we take our
[53:06] bodies our lives and sit down we read
[53:09] and we pray and we're praying you know
[53:11] even throughout the day as god has
[53:13] spoken to us and listening to the mess
[53:14] what are we doing we're putting
[53:16] ourselves in a place and bringing it to
[53:18] where that the mind of christ might have
[53:22] the right of way
[53:28] i think of this statement here the
[53:29] greatest thing
[53:31] if i just gave that statement to you and
[53:33] say
[53:34] what would you say would be the greatest
[53:36] thing
[53:37] that you could ever see in your life
[53:40] probably a lot of different
[53:42] things that we would say
[53:45] because we have
[53:47] we have in our mind sometimes the way
[53:49] that we think about the greatest things
[53:51] it would be
[53:53] you know to walking on the water and
[53:55] that's a great thing
[53:57] because that's not that's not i mean i
[53:59] don't know about you i don't know the
[53:59] last time you walked on the water i
[54:01] walked on the water you know
[54:04] you know i mean
[54:06] so it's a great thing
[54:09] remember
[54:11] even when peter stepped out of the boat
[54:14] he asked the lord jesus bid me to come
[54:17] to you
[54:20] oh my we could preach on this now
[54:24] you peter just didn't take right out
[54:28] but he could have had faith to do that
[54:31] but it's an example to you and i
[54:33] that as we see the lord and what how god
[54:37] is moving we can ask him and say lord
[54:40] bid me because there is authority that
[54:43] comes with his voice
[54:46] when he says something we can step out
[54:48] on it
[54:50] because it's his voice
[54:52] that gives us the strength to defy all
[54:55] the elements and all the laws that are
[54:57] there it's the strength in his voice and
[55:00] that's the same way it is in our life as
[55:02] it was with peter
[55:06] look at that that's a great thing and it
[55:07] was a great thing
[55:09] and even in the midst of it when peter
[55:11] began to sink
[55:12] at least he cried out and said lord save
[55:15] me
[55:16] lest i perish
[55:19] so the same god
[55:21] that had given him authority to step out
[55:23] on is the same god that after fear had
[55:26] come in
[55:27] faith had been loosened from his life
[55:30] that same god came there
[55:32] and brought an authority and raised him
[55:35] up
[55:36] you didn't have to swim to the shore
[55:39] you have to swim back to the boat
[55:42] this the same god was right there
[55:46] hallelujah the greatest thing what would
[55:49] we say is the greatest thing let me let
[55:51] me read to you what brother randall says
[55:52] the greatest thing that i've ever seen
[55:54] in my life
[55:56] is just submit yourself to god
[55:58] and walk in the spirit
[56:01] day after day
[56:03] and how he'll lead you and he'll guide
[56:05] you to do things
[56:06] that's the greatest thing to be led by
[56:09] the spirit of god
[56:11] and if that's the greatest thing which
[56:12] it is to submit it's a submitting of our
[56:15] will there's a battle that goes on
[56:18] there's thoughts that come in
[56:20] there's even when you're going to do
[56:22] what's right the enemy can come and try
[56:24] to torment you in your mind
[56:27] sure he can
[56:29] is is not that's not an exemption no
[56:31] matter who you are or where you are
[56:34] saying i think how brother brown made a
[56:36] statement
[56:37] uh when he went over and he preached you
[56:38] know brother brown preached blind
[56:40] bartimaeus many times
[56:42] but one of the times brother brown says
[56:44] here he stands at the end of that
[56:45] message and after what god has done in
[56:47] that service and he says over there in
[56:49] the hotel
[56:51] how he says that satan has tormented my
[56:53] mind and telling me the people aren't
[56:56] going to get it
[56:57] they're not going to understand this
[56:59] they're not going to take this
[57:01] but brother bram says see look at that
[57:03] right there
[57:04] you see it's overriding that because
[57:07] satan knows even how we're made up
[57:09] sometimes and things can come in our
[57:11] mind but it's it's and you say how do we
[57:13] discern it well the voice of god will
[57:16] never bring condemnation
[57:18] god's voice will never bring fear
[57:23] it'll never bring fear that's binding to
[57:25] you like that that's not what god's
[57:27] voice does the voice of god releases you
[57:30] and i
[57:31] it's satan that works that way and
[57:34] that's one way to discern and you might
[57:36] say well i hear thoughts coming to me
[57:38] and they seem like they're in my voice
[57:39] but you discern those thoughts by the
[57:42] word and what i'm talking about by the
[57:44] word i'm talking about by the word you
[57:46] discern the characteristics of
[57:52] them think of this
[57:55] in the scriptures in hebrews 11
[57:59] by faith the walls of jericho
[58:02] fell down
[58:04] now faith is what
[58:07] it's a revelation of god's will
[58:10] it's a revelation that before we see
[58:12] anything
[58:14] that this is the will of god
[58:17] now let's just be honest there's things
[58:19] within that we come face to face with
[58:22] that we don't have the same unfolding
[58:25] that joshua had where joshua seen the
[58:29] walls fall down
[58:31] but what is enough is that joshua seen
[58:34] it
[58:35] god opened to him by vision
[58:38] and then joshua could come back and say
[58:41] the victory belongs to us
[58:45] and that's the same way that the lord
[58:47] jesus has done and he does
[58:50] time and time again that you and i
[58:52] cannot see it already done
[58:56] i want you to understand seeing it
[58:58] already done is not faith
[59:02] as far as understand seeing all the
[59:04] outcomes of it
[59:06] this is going to happen like this this
[59:08] is going to happen like that this is
[59:09] going to happen that we don't don't
[59:11] always see that
[59:13] those are things sometimes that's very
[59:14] rare that it happens in that way but we
[59:17] walk by faith by knowing god this is the
[59:21] pathway that you're opening i prayed
[59:23] about this i've looked to you for
[59:25] direction lord and above everything else
[59:27] if it's not your will you know you still
[59:30] know how to close everything off lord
[59:32] because ultimately in everything i want
[59:36] your will above it all
[59:39] i might be a little disappointed but i
[59:42] want your will
[59:43] my disappointment i'll get over there
[59:45] but your will lord that's what i want
[59:48] because i desire that you be glorified
[59:53] because i can't make this happen but
[59:55] lord
[59:56] you're more than able to bring it to
[59:58] pass by faith
[1:00:01] the walls of jericho
[1:00:03] had fallen down
[1:00:05] but the the bible says
[1:00:07] after
[1:00:09] they were compassed about
[1:00:11] seven days now think about this the
[1:00:14] walls are going to fall you see it's one
[1:00:16] thing to say the walls are going to fall
[1:00:18] and then somebody comes and tells you
[1:00:20] here comes joshua back in the camp
[1:00:23] he announces he has to gather together
[1:00:25] the camp
[1:00:27] and let them know
[1:00:29] jericho belongs to us you've known that
[1:00:32] god has spoken
[1:00:34] and here's how
[1:00:35] the lord is going to do it
[1:00:38] how is that joshua
[1:00:40] shall we get our crowbars ready to go
[1:00:43] no
[1:00:44] let me tell you how it's going to happen
[1:00:46] this is what he said
[1:00:48] he said we're going to shout
[1:00:51] and the walls are going to fall
[1:00:55] i wonder i wonder
[1:00:58] to
[1:00:59] the minds when that first was said right
[1:01:01] there
[1:01:02] if the mind itself likes sarah
[1:01:05] when it came when sarah heard thou shalt
[1:01:07] conceive and sarah could say we've been
[1:01:09] trying this for a long time
[1:01:12] and to no avail sarah knew
[1:01:14] the hindrances she knew the obstacles
[1:01:17] but it wasn't her body that was the
[1:01:19] obstacle
[1:01:20] [Applause]
[1:01:23] it wasn't her body that was the obstacle
[1:01:25] her eye her body was no problem for god
[1:01:28] but god came down to deal with sarah's
[1:01:32] unbelief
[1:01:33] because the unbelief was greater than
[1:01:36] any barrenness of her womb
[1:01:39] and that's why god has come down now as
[1:01:42] the captain of the large house in this
[1:01:44] generation
[1:01:46] is to deal with the unbelief
[1:01:53] he didn't he didn't send a portion or a
[1:01:55] part he came himself he is here among us
[1:02:00] [Music]
[1:02:02] and he's letting you and i know that
[1:02:04] there has been down through the ages
[1:02:07] there's been parts of that of man but in
[1:02:10] this time i made a promise
[1:02:13] at the revealing of the son of man that
[1:02:16] i would come in my fullness and the mind
[1:02:18] would set down upon the people
[1:02:24] do you understand what we have access to
[1:02:27] we have access to the mind of christ
[1:02:34] this is why the scripture in john 14
[1:02:38] show us the father brother adam's just
[1:02:40] not quoting bible verses he's announcing
[1:02:43] under the inspiration by the revelation
[1:02:47] that is given to him he
[1:02:49] is the one who's been here all alone
[1:02:56] this ministry is not william branham
[1:02:59] it's the ministry of the son of man
[1:03:06] not a church to lead us not an idea to
[1:03:09] lead us but as captain of the lord's
[1:03:11] house am i now come
[1:03:19] that's what the whole unfolding of the
[1:03:21] seventh seal is
[1:03:22] it's revealing
[1:03:24] the christ who always was
[1:03:26] has always been here
[1:03:29] and now he is declaring his glory among
[1:03:32] his people
[1:03:37] hallelujah it's the same god he didn't
[1:03:39] leave us
[1:03:40] he's right here with us
[1:03:42] remember as he reveals himself by his
[1:03:45] word he comes and he speaks to our life
[1:03:47] listen right here tonight
[1:03:49] in a thursday service a sunday service
[1:03:52] it doesn't matter hearing god himself
[1:03:55] makes himself known that i'm still
[1:03:57] captain of the lord's host
[1:03:59] now it comes to you and i will we allow
[1:04:02] him to have his rightful position and
[1:04:05] say lord i don't understand how a shout
[1:04:08] is going to bring down walls but i trust
[1:04:11] you lord god
[1:04:16] hallelujah
[1:04:18] oh glory to the carnal mind
[1:04:20] it was foolishness
[1:04:25] i mean come on when's the last time you
[1:04:27] shouted something down
[1:04:30] right
[1:04:32] foolishness
[1:04:34] joshua knew about them walls if any of
[1:04:37] you want to talk to anybody about walls
[1:04:40] and all the metrics and physics and
[1:04:41] everything else joshua knew that
[1:04:46] you see what that shows that the things
[1:04:48] that you and i come face to face with
[1:04:50] there's a lot of times there's things
[1:04:52] that you and i come face to face with
[1:04:54] and we can look at and say well i know
[1:04:56] this or i know that and i know this but
[1:04:58] god says there is a greater
[1:05:00] understanding here
[1:05:02] than your understanding
[1:05:05] amen you're not just you're not just you
[1:05:08] know we like that little mechanic he was
[1:05:10] putting this here and putting that
[1:05:11] little wire there putting this little
[1:05:13] wire here testing this testing that you
[1:05:15] know you can all say well at least he
[1:05:17] was doing something but to think he was
[1:05:19] doing this doing that doing this doing
[1:05:21] that and here came up a man
[1:05:23] in a suit and tie
[1:05:25] and looked over
[1:05:26] in that
[1:05:27] open
[1:05:28] uh
[1:05:29] uh under the hood
[1:05:31] and he spoke to him and said
[1:05:33] why don't you take this wire
[1:05:35] and touch it here
[1:05:37] just by looks here's a mechanic maybe
[1:05:40] grease up to his elbows shirt all rolled
[1:05:42] up
[1:05:43] he works on cars for a living
[1:05:45] but here comes one up there and when he
[1:05:48] takes the wire and touches that
[1:05:51] the problem's soft
[1:05:54] now he's got a choice that little
[1:05:55] mechanic could have looked at the suit
[1:05:58] and the suit itself he could have said
[1:06:00] who are you
[1:06:01] but he was in such a place was that he
[1:06:04] heeded what was said and when that
[1:06:06] started it caused him to ask who are you
[1:06:10] he said i am the engineer who designed
[1:06:13] that engine
[1:06:16] and that's why the prophet could
[1:06:18] announce there is a man here that can
[1:06:21] turn on the light
[1:06:23] it's jesus christ the son of man right
[1:06:26] here among us
[1:06:29] we can try to touch this to this to this
[1:06:31] to this to this to this to this to this
[1:06:33] but if we'll just let him direct us he
[1:06:36] knows how to tell us touch this to this
[1:06:48] in the midst of it joshua
[1:06:51] after hearing this
[1:06:53] he couldn't only he didn't lean to his
[1:06:54] own understanding
[1:06:56] he could have
[1:06:57] you realize he could have
[1:06:59] do you realize he had to override his
[1:07:01] own understanding because his
[1:07:02] understanding knew about the walls
[1:07:06] right
[1:07:08] just like a you know when a doctor or a
[1:07:10] nurse or they can only give you the
[1:07:12] understanding that they have all this
[1:07:14] could never be
[1:07:16] your eyes will always be this way it's
[1:07:17] just gonna they're only giving you the
[1:07:19] understanding they know
[1:07:21] but there's a greater understanding that
[1:07:23] sets down
[1:07:25] where does that understanding come from
[1:07:27] it comes from the captain
[1:07:29] of the host of the lord
[1:07:33] hallelujah and inspires you
[1:07:36] inspires you and anoints you
[1:07:39] and others can look at you and even to
[1:07:40] your own way of thinking
[1:07:43] it sounds crazy
[1:07:47] are you hearing me
[1:07:48] it sounds crazy
[1:07:50] this is gonna that god is my healer
[1:07:53] i'm not gonna this right here is passing
[1:07:55] from my life
[1:07:58] are you hearing me
[1:08:01] this is where you we have to go beyond
[1:08:03] our own thinking
[1:08:06] have to go beyond what we see because
[1:08:08] what we see is not real
[1:08:11] it thanks we think it's real
[1:08:13] are you hearing me
[1:08:16] that's why i like the definition that
[1:08:18] brother ernie of illinois came up with
[1:08:19] with fear he said here's what fear is
[1:08:21] it's false evidence appearing real
[1:08:25] it's true isn't it
[1:08:28] things come in you know and my goodness
[1:08:30] you entertain the thought and everything
[1:08:31] else they have you in such a work up in
[1:08:32] no time you entertain it what happened
[1:08:34] was it shows you that thoughts
[1:08:36] themselves are not just empty little
[1:08:38] things it's spirits
[1:08:42] it's spirit so if satan works that way i
[1:08:45] don't know about you but i want to fill
[1:08:47] my mind with thoughts of god
[1:08:49] i just want to fill it up he said
[1:08:50] brother samuel i can't remember it it
[1:08:51] ain't about remembering at all i just
[1:08:53] want if there's going to these airwaves
[1:08:55] are going to be filled with things i
[1:08:57] want it to be filled with the things of
[1:08:58] god
[1:09:00] whether it's music the word of god i
[1:09:02] want it to be filled with the word of
[1:09:03] god to where that do when i do get out
[1:09:05] there in the public my life has become
[1:09:08] so full and filled up
[1:09:10] with god
[1:09:12] because remember our minds
[1:09:15] are in no man's land
[1:09:18] so
[1:09:19] with that no man's land it depends on
[1:09:21] what are we going to fill it with
[1:09:25] whatever you fill it with will affect
[1:09:27] you
[1:09:30] sometimes it isn't even watching the
[1:09:32] news or looking at this sometimes it's
[1:09:34] entertaining you can get to looking at
[1:09:36] your own insufficiencies
[1:09:38] and not looking at them
[1:09:41] through the blood of jesus christ
[1:09:44] you say how do i do that you can say
[1:09:46] lord
[1:09:47] i'm nothing without you
[1:09:49] i have failed you lord many times
[1:09:52] but your grace is sufficient
[1:09:54] lord that you would teach me lord you
[1:09:56] would strengthen me within all this
[1:09:58] sometimes god has to allow you and i to
[1:10:00] see that we in ourselves are nothing we
[1:10:03] don't have this all together
[1:10:07] oh glory be to god joshua got out to
[1:10:10] himself
[1:10:14] graham said he went out to meditate and
[1:10:16] pray
[1:10:17] sometimes that getting away is not all
[1:10:19] together maybe getting away from the
[1:10:21] house sometimes it's getting away from
[1:10:22] us
[1:10:25] if i can get away from samuel
[1:10:28] right you can get away from carlos
[1:10:30] you get away from bill you get away from
[1:10:32] richie
[1:10:33] he said how do i do that
[1:10:35] how do i get away
[1:10:38] is it just
[1:10:39] getting along with god how do i get
[1:10:41] along with god
[1:10:42] just begin to look to him and begin just
[1:10:44] to worship him
[1:10:47] begin to worship him you might feel
[1:10:50] so inadequate
[1:10:51] you might feel so
[1:10:54] oh lord i i'm such a failure i judge you
[1:10:56] but don't don't entertain that in that
[1:10:58] way but look to him and say lord you're
[1:11:00] worthy
[1:11:01] begin to worship him because he is the
[1:11:04] worthy one
[1:11:08] when we begin to get away from our own
[1:11:10] selves our own thinking that's why i
[1:11:12] said when we're praying sometimes and
[1:11:14] i'm speaking from experience i know i'm
[1:11:15] preach preaching to people within that
[1:11:18] experience as well sometimes there's
[1:11:19] things that we can pray about and we're
[1:11:21] praying about this need maybe it's
[1:11:23] family or something else and we're
[1:11:24] praying about it or it's things you know
[1:11:26] these particular needs in the church or
[1:11:28] this particular answer and we're praying
[1:11:30] or praying and so we become soul within
[1:11:33] that right there that we really don't
[1:11:35] get away from our own thoughts about it
[1:11:41] instead of saying lord as we can pray
[1:11:43] and commit it to god and we pray and
[1:11:46] begin to pray just begin to worship him
[1:11:50] because that's what's going to invite
[1:11:51] him
[1:11:52] because let me tell you something no
[1:11:53] matter what the situation is
[1:11:56] god is greater than that situation
[1:11:59] you first have got to start with that
[1:12:01] god you're greater than this problem
[1:12:04] you say brother samuel what is that well
[1:12:06] that's called not looking at the scene
[1:12:11] but looking to the unseen
[1:12:13] i want you to remember that they had to
[1:12:15] go around these walls of jericho
[1:12:18] for seven days
[1:12:20] and for six days they had to go around
[1:12:23] one time
[1:12:28] now these people knew
[1:12:30] they're not gonna fall on the first time
[1:12:32] around
[1:12:33] it was already enough
[1:12:35] to accept
[1:12:37] and believe that of what god had said
[1:12:42] because never has walls fallen down
[1:12:44] walls are going to come down by the
[1:12:46] sound of a trumpet
[1:12:48] a
[1:12:48] shout that doesn't line up
[1:12:52] right
[1:12:55] and let alone going around those walls
[1:12:59] remember jericho is shut up
[1:13:02] nobody's coming in or out
[1:13:05] and i wonder
[1:13:06] when they went around after the first
[1:13:08] day
[1:13:09] they go back
[1:13:12] they come the second day
[1:13:14] i wonder if they just didn't start
[1:13:15] hearing
[1:13:19] now maybe nobody was you know coming out
[1:13:21] real bold and saying
[1:13:23] look at these guys
[1:13:24] maybe they just you know smirks
[1:13:28] i wonder what was being said because
[1:13:30] when they walked around there do you
[1:13:32] understand there was a battle going on
[1:13:36] every step every journey around that
[1:13:39] wall was a testimony
[1:13:42] and was a confession
[1:13:46] the bible says that he had put
[1:13:48] everything under his feet howbeit we see
[1:13:51] not all things under his feet
[1:13:55] but it goes on to say seeing that we
[1:13:58] have an high priest seeing that we have
[1:14:01] a high priest who can be touched by the
[1:14:03] feeling of our infirmities let us hold
[1:14:06] fast to our profession
[1:14:09] that the first day around nothing
[1:14:11] happened
[1:14:12] and they knew nothing was going to
[1:14:13] happen
[1:14:15] second day around nothing happened
[1:14:18] but let me tell you though there wasn't
[1:14:20] any walls that was falling down but
[1:14:23] every day walls was crumbling in their
[1:14:26] lives
[1:14:28] faith was being built in the promise of
[1:14:31] almighty god
[1:14:33] joshua saw the vision and he announced
[1:14:35] it by the word of god he spoke by the
[1:14:38] revelation of his faith
[1:14:41] are you hearing me
[1:14:43] he spoke by the revelation of his faith
[1:14:45] and there were for those lives that god
[1:14:49] would inspire that word and they would
[1:14:51] simply let go of their thoughts and
[1:14:54] start marching around jericho
[1:14:58] they overcame the mockery
[1:15:01] they overcame every thought that would
[1:15:03] come into their mind
[1:15:05] what are you doing here
[1:15:07] you know how silly this looks
[1:15:13] you know what i'm talking about
[1:15:15] you know what i'm talking about
[1:15:17] they weren't just walking around they
[1:15:19] were there
[1:15:21] this is battle this speaks to you and i
[1:15:24] that even when you know god's will satan
[1:15:28] is not going to back up and say whoa
[1:15:31] paul knows the will of god
[1:15:33] he knows the will of god satan is there
[1:15:36] to try to rattle you
[1:15:38] [Applause]
[1:15:40] he wants to try to draw you out i wonder
[1:15:43] how many things were being said off the
[1:15:45] walls when it came to the fifth day
[1:15:52] the wickedness and what it was on the
[1:15:54] sixth day
[1:15:55] the enemy thought my goodness
[1:15:59] i've got this
[1:16:01] but here came the seventh day
[1:16:04] and on the seventh day
[1:16:07] something was different
[1:16:11] israel was marching around these walls
[1:16:15] not once
[1:16:17] not twice
[1:16:18] they marched
[1:16:20] seven
[1:16:21] times
[1:16:22] around the wall
[1:16:24] identifying this
[1:16:27] is the completion
[1:16:31] there was not a shout that went forth
[1:16:34] before the ending of that seventh age
[1:16:36] seventh day
[1:16:38] but at the ending of that seventh time
[1:16:40] notice all seven trumpets sounded in
[1:16:44] unison every thunder sounded all
[1:16:47] altogether
[1:16:50] and what did that thunder do
[1:16:52] that thunder brought a revival in the
[1:16:55] lives of the bride of jesus christ
[1:16:59] [Music]
[1:17:01] every voice sounded in unison
[1:17:05] and when that sounded
[1:17:07] they knew it was time for them to shout
[1:17:11] and what were they shouting they were
[1:17:14] shouting what the trumpets had sounded
[1:17:17] it was a shout of victory
[1:17:20] [Music]
[1:17:23] and the walls came down
[1:17:25] [Applause]
[1:17:28] at the trumpets and the sounding
[1:17:32] of the shout
[1:17:35] let me tell you
[1:17:36] the shout has brought down
[1:17:38] every
[1:17:39] wall
[1:17:43] satan could think he's got things walled
[1:17:45] in on your life
[1:17:47] maybe a sickness
[1:17:49] maybe a habit
[1:17:51] you can think he's got it walled in but
[1:17:53] it's no match for god
[1:17:55] amen
[1:17:56] the captain of the lord's host
[1:17:59] is here
[1:18:03] it might have escaped and like brother
[1:18:04] brown said it's walled to the doctor but
[1:18:07] it's not walled to god
[1:18:17] so daily what were they doing
[1:18:20] daily
[1:18:21] they were walking
[1:18:23] with a confession
[1:18:25] that this
[1:18:27] promise
[1:18:28] is mine
[1:18:31] daily
[1:18:32] they were walking step by step how's
[1:18:35] this going to be
[1:18:36] how's it going to be
[1:18:39] god made it known and it was beyond that
[1:18:41] of the natural
[1:18:43] mind
[1:18:45] where did that all come
[1:18:48] it all come through prayer
[1:18:52] right
[1:18:53] he came through prayer
[1:18:56] joshua knowing this is the certainty
[1:18:58] that he comes back to ask the father
[1:19:00] anything in my name and i'll do it
[1:19:04] lord what's what's your will
[1:19:07] in this lord
[1:19:10] what's your will
[1:19:12] now think of this think of the
[1:19:14] other part
[1:19:17] let me close with this
[1:19:20] the walls fall flat
[1:19:23] amazing
[1:19:25] here's a little lady by the name of
[1:19:26] rahab her house is on the wall
[1:19:34] walls falling flat that's a huge thing
[1:19:38] but her house
[1:19:41] remains
[1:19:43] as a matter of fact her house has been
[1:19:45] so established
[1:19:48] that when it came time
[1:19:50] joshua tells the men
[1:19:52] go in and get rahab and her family
[1:19:59] she could feel
[1:20:00] the walls rocking swaying giving way
[1:20:04] but she was on a firm foundation
[1:20:08] she had a token
[1:20:11] of the living god
[1:20:13] of the same captain of the lord's house
[1:20:16] that had revealed himself to joshua she
[1:20:19] had a token
[1:20:21] and she had operated under that token to
[1:20:24] get her family in there
[1:20:27] and when the walls were rocking her
[1:20:30] house was on a solid rock
[1:20:34] it shows that in the midst of the test
[1:20:36] or trial and what you're praying about
[1:20:39] everything else can be rocking and
[1:20:41] reeling all around you but you've got an
[1:20:45] anchor
[1:20:48] in jesus christ
[1:20:51] it goes beyond the natural mind that's
[1:20:54] why
[1:20:56] when we pray
[1:21:01] father
[1:21:02] that are in heaven
[1:21:04] hallowed
[1:21:06] be thy name
[1:21:08] thy kingdom come
[1:21:11] thy will be done
[1:21:13] in earth
[1:21:15] even as it is in heaven
[1:21:18] give us this day our daily bread give me
[1:21:20] the strength lord what is needed in this
[1:21:23] day give me lord the nourishment of your
[1:21:25] word of the holy spirit lord what's
[1:21:27] needed in this moment lord
[1:21:32] and lead me not into temptation lord
[1:21:35] but deliver me from evil father
[1:21:41] that is the kingdom
[1:21:43] the power
[1:21:45] and the glory
[1:21:47] forever
[1:21:49] and ever
[1:21:50] amen
[1:21:54] that's what we need
[1:21:57] no matter the situation friends listen
[1:21:59] no matter the situation
[1:22:02] what we really need
[1:22:04] that makes it so simple it's just a
[1:22:06] simple statement he makes in great
[1:22:07] warrior joshua
[1:22:10] joshua went
[1:22:12] to pray
[1:22:14] and he met the captain of the lord's
[1:22:15] host and when he met him
[1:22:18] that was it
[1:22:20] that's what we really need to be seeking
[1:22:21] for no matter
[1:22:23] no matter what
[1:22:24] what is taking place around us no matter
[1:22:26] what adversity no matter what obstacle
[1:22:27] no matter
[1:22:29] walls whatever it is
[1:22:32] we say lord
[1:22:35] let your will be done lord here
[1:22:39] lord you you lord i
[1:22:42] i need to see you father
[1:22:43] and i believe we see him i believe he
[1:22:45] comes and he he speaks to us through his
[1:22:47] word
[1:22:48] he performs his word as he said he would
[1:22:50] do
[1:22:51] but we can just take a hold in that you
[1:22:53] know
[1:22:53] sometimes we can
[1:22:55] we can fail to see what god is doing in
[1:22:57] the midst of a service and how that he's
[1:22:59] coming and he's pulsating right through
[1:23:02] his word it's pulsating to our heart
[1:23:04] sometimes
[1:23:05] we don't catch that pulsation or rather
[1:23:07] we don't
[1:23:08] give it preeminence like we should
[1:23:11] we still entertaining our problem still
[1:23:14] entertaining what's there instead of
[1:23:16] taking that pulsation as it begins to
[1:23:18] pulsate in our lives i'm the lord
[1:23:21] i'm the lord that healeth thee
[1:23:23] i'm the lord your deliverer
[1:23:26] i'm the lord who gives the holy ghost
[1:23:28] and the and it begins to pulsate in our
[1:23:31] lives and then we can start looking back
[1:23:33] at the problem but don't don't look at
[1:23:34] the problem
[1:23:36] you'll never get anywhere by looking at
[1:23:37] it
[1:23:38] you have to look
[1:23:40] to the unseen
[1:23:43] let me tell you friends there's no
[1:23:44] situation nothing
[1:23:47] that's too great for god
[1:23:50] if god would have told joshua go up to
[1:23:52] the door and the doors will fall down
[1:23:55] that still would have been a miracle
[1:23:57] but god takes things that are so
[1:24:00] ridiculous to the mind
[1:24:03] that you just don't make sense to the
[1:24:05] mind but that's where
[1:24:07] god is able to declare
[1:24:10] his glory and his power and it's not
[1:24:12] just for that moment
[1:24:14] because there's going to be more walls
[1:24:15] you'll come up against
[1:24:17] there'll be other situations you come up
[1:24:19] against and it looks oh that's very
[1:24:21] thick oh that's a thick wall brother
[1:24:23] sammy you don't know how i'm telling you
[1:24:25] my son's a thick guy no but there's
[1:24:28] nothing
[1:24:29] that's too great
[1:24:31] for god
[1:24:36] but like joshua
[1:24:39] the first thing we have to say is lord
[1:24:43] what would you have
[1:24:46] your servant do
[1:24:50] and the first thing
[1:24:52] as he worships and he says that the
[1:24:54] first thing is
[1:24:57] stop
[1:24:59] your ways
[1:25:01] take your ways off
[1:25:03] the shoes take your ways off
[1:25:06] lord why do i need to take my shoes off
[1:25:08] just release
[1:25:09] your ways
[1:25:11] to me
[1:25:15] and god doesn't have to tell you and i
[1:25:16] this is you know this is going to happen
[1:25:18] this way and
[1:25:19] god doesn't have to do that
[1:25:23] he doesn't have to tell us like we look
[1:25:24] in our directions when we're on a trip
[1:25:26] you're going to go five miles on on you
[1:25:28] know 58 you're gonna make a right onto
[1:25:31] jones road and you're gonna
[1:25:32] that's not how god works
[1:25:34] it's trusting
[1:25:36] him
[1:25:40] the bigger wall
[1:25:42] than the walls of jericho
[1:25:44] was the wall
[1:25:46] of joshua's own will
[1:25:50] that was a bigger wall than the walls of
[1:25:52] jericho
[1:25:54] that
[1:25:55] held more impossibilities than the walls
[1:25:58] of jericho coming down the walls of
[1:26:00] jericho coming down were nothing
[1:26:02] compared to joshua's will
[1:26:07] it's our will
[1:26:09] it's the battle
[1:26:11] and the lord jesus in the garden of
[1:26:12] gethsemane he prayed three times
[1:26:18] so you know what that shows
[1:26:20] there's a wrestling and there's a war
[1:26:23] and remember the war
[1:26:25] is with our own will
[1:26:28] while we're wrestling with our own will
[1:26:33] demons are encamped round about
[1:26:36] spirits are encamped around about
[1:26:38] remember just like samson right there in
[1:26:40] the time of the arena where the most
[1:26:42] philistines were
[1:26:43] slain
[1:26:45] all were mocking and laughing at him
[1:26:48] when the lord jesus was in the garden of
[1:26:50] gethsemane brother bram says every demon
[1:26:53] out of torment
[1:26:54] was gathered all around
[1:26:58] it was like a great coliseum
[1:27:02] so the wrestling everything
[1:27:04] everything was put before him he knew
[1:27:08] what awaited him
[1:27:11] with the crucifixion
[1:27:13] and he prayed
[1:27:15] knowing
[1:27:16] nobody else could take his place
[1:27:19] he knew that
[1:27:21] sounds pretty personal don't it
[1:27:25] nevertheless not my will thine will be
[1:27:27] done goes
[1:27:29] comes back again
[1:27:31] and he prays
[1:27:32] the same prayer
[1:27:35] goals
[1:27:36] comes back again
[1:27:38] praise it
[1:27:39] the same time
[1:27:40] if the lord jesus had to pray that three
[1:27:43] times
[1:27:44] how much more for you and i
[1:27:47] many times where we fail is is after one
[1:27:49] time we feel like i still feel the
[1:27:51] struggle that don't mean you're defeated
[1:27:53] it just means you're putting
[1:27:55] your will in subjection
[1:27:57] so what do i do go back and pray again
[1:28:00] say lord god
[1:28:01] let my will die lord to your will
[1:28:05] listen i feel my will surging again what
[1:28:07] do i do go once again
[1:28:10] say lord not my will thine will be done
[1:28:14] but too many times we give up
[1:28:17] too quickly
[1:28:19] and our own will
[1:28:21] gets in the way
[1:28:24] is that right sister mercy used to sing
[1:28:25] a song lord keep me in your will so i
[1:28:29] don't get in your way
[1:28:33] right because when we're not in his will
[1:28:35] we're in the way
[1:28:37] right
[1:28:40] but may we submit our wills to him
[1:28:45] lord help me
[1:28:47] help me lord that my will
[1:28:49] can be so surrendered to your will
[1:28:52] in every situation it's not just a
[1:28:53] one-time thing it's situation after
[1:28:56] situation and remember that's where the
[1:28:58] battle was won and let me just ask you
[1:29:01] how was that battle won
[1:29:04] how was that battle won
[1:29:07] jesus was not quoting scripture to
[1:29:09] himself he could have
[1:29:11] right he could have because we're told
[1:29:13] let the redeemed of the lord
[1:29:15] say so let the weak say
[1:29:17] i am strong
[1:29:19] he could have done that but how was that
[1:29:22] victory won through prayer
[1:29:25] so then it lets us see that prayer
[1:29:28] is really us humbling ourselves
[1:29:32] to the will of god
[1:29:34] that's where real prayer is real prayer
[1:29:36] isn't that we have said paragraphs and
[1:29:38] lord i've called everybody's name out
[1:29:41] but real prayer
[1:29:42] is when we can come to the place to
[1:29:44] recognize we're in his presence
[1:29:47] it might be when you're in your prayer
[1:29:49] closet
[1:29:50] it might just be that you recognize when
[1:29:53] you're driving down the road
[1:29:56] there's one in the truck with you
[1:29:57] there's one in the car with you
[1:29:59] and you begin to worship him
[1:30:02] and entertain
[1:30:03] his
[1:30:04] presence oh there's victory isn't there
[1:30:09] let's pray
[1:30:11] heavenly father
[1:30:14] lord you are so
[1:30:16] merciful and so mindful lord
[1:30:19] in every need
[1:30:21] each situation lord
[1:30:23] that lord
[1:30:25] could ever be placed before us
[1:30:29] i think lord that every one of us here
[1:30:31] that's gathered in this building lord
[1:30:33] tonight
[1:30:35] whether lord we are before a jericho
[1:30:37] have been before a jericho
[1:30:39] or they'll be a jericho
[1:30:41] lord
[1:30:43] every
[1:30:44] thing that's always right before us and
[1:30:46] lord
[1:30:46] sometimes
[1:30:49] it isn't the things that we look at
[1:30:50] sometimes or we get in trouble
[1:30:53] that we say oh that's impossible
[1:30:55] sometimes lord where we get in trouble
[1:30:57] is where we think we can do something
[1:30:59] about it
[1:31:03] god help us lord
[1:31:06] lord i pray for
[1:31:07] everyone in here including myself
[1:31:10] help us lord jesus
[1:31:13] that god that we can recognize
[1:31:18] each moment
[1:31:20] our need for you lord
[1:31:22] not just when lord the situation or
[1:31:26] or lord
[1:31:27] an obstacle arises
[1:31:30] that may we
[1:31:32] lord take in our lives daily
[1:31:36] give us our daily bread
[1:31:40] lord that we would live and
[1:31:42] fill our lives with the word of god
[1:31:46] david said i have set the lord always
[1:31:48] before me
[1:31:50] and i shall not be moved
[1:31:52] because he is at my right hand he is my
[1:31:56] strength in my life
[1:31:59] i've set him before me oh god
[1:32:02] lord
[1:32:04] whatever that situation whatever that
[1:32:06] means
[1:32:07] may we look away to you tonight lord
[1:32:11] may we see only you lord
[1:32:14] may we put footsteps
[1:32:17] around those walls lord
[1:32:20] maybe situations lord in a family
[1:32:24] god may we put footsteps of the love of
[1:32:26] god
[1:32:28] may we lord
[1:32:31] follow your way i'm sure lord that
[1:32:34] that brother
[1:32:36] his name slips my mind right now
[1:32:38] lord but him and his wife did not
[1:32:42] lord she always was very despairing
[1:32:46] disparaging against
[1:32:49] lord of
[1:32:50] his walk with you that of the
[1:32:52] pentecostal movement she always had
[1:32:54] something to say and it wasn't her it
[1:32:57] wasn't her lord
[1:32:59] but how that lord the enemy had been
[1:33:01] able to come in there
[1:33:06] and his way of doing it was to grab her
[1:33:09] pull her out in the middle of the floor
[1:33:11] and he was going to cast that spirit off
[1:33:13] of her
[1:33:14] and it was a spirit
[1:33:16] but that wasn't the way to cast it off
[1:33:18] her that
[1:33:19] was not how
[1:33:20] those walls were going to fall
[1:33:23] but your prophet
[1:33:26] was able to take the brother aside and
[1:33:28] lord
[1:33:29] more than just what the prophet gave
[1:33:31] thank god there was a heart that was
[1:33:33] willing to lay down his own way his own
[1:33:35] will his own thinking
[1:33:38] and he said the next time
[1:33:41] get a box of chocolates
[1:33:44] and when you go into her and she starts
[1:33:45] on that
[1:33:46] [Music]
[1:33:47] just give her those box of chocolates
[1:33:52] tell her you love her
[1:33:57] lord
[1:33:58] when that brother came back to brother
[1:34:00] branham this is the testimony
[1:34:03] he said brother branham my home
[1:34:06] has been
[1:34:07] revolutionized
[1:34:12] it wasn't the chocolates that did it

[1:36:29] of lord listening to the message of the

[1:37:00] prayer lord that's the real prayer lord
[1:37:03] so many times lord is needs and
[1:37:05] situations lord arise but that's my
[1:37:08] prayer is lord
[1:37:10] what's your will in this
[1:37:13] i can look at something but i want to
[1:37:14] know what your will is in it lord
[1:37:16] how would you say to how how should we
[1:37:19] do this lord how do we approach this
[1:37:22] because you know your sheep by name
[1:37:26] you know them lord each person you know
[1:37:28] our lives
[1:37:30] so
[1:37:31] personally
[1:37:33] granted lord i pray
[1:37:36] oh lord in the name of jesus christ
[1:37:40] thank you lord
[1:37:46] amen
[1:37:49] you know
[1:37:52] i just i just so appreciate the lord how
[1:37:54] that he would speak to us in these
[1:37:55] things
[1:37:57] because we could look at and we could
[1:37:59] think of the walls of jericho and maybe
[1:38:01] you see in your own life you see
[1:38:03] in your life you say well brother samuel
[1:38:05] i've got this particular maybe it's a
[1:38:06] condition in your body or something you
[1:38:09] know and
[1:38:10] your spirit or something and you could
[1:38:12] look at it and say
[1:38:13] well sam you know i you know here i've
[1:38:15] got to take medicine for this but don't
[1:38:17] look down
[1:38:18] don't look down on yourself that's
[1:38:20] that's that's not god doing that
[1:38:23] that's walking around jericho
[1:38:27] putting footsteps around it
[1:38:29] now you and i may not look at it as
[1:38:31] glorious as we would like to see this i
[1:38:33] wonder how many people
[1:38:35] think about the young man the young
[1:38:37] brother
[1:38:38] where they sold everything
[1:38:40] to come to the meeting because that boy
[1:38:43] had that growth
[1:38:46] and when they got there and came across
[1:38:48] the platform
[1:38:50] the angel of the lord speaks through the
[1:38:51] prophet and tells them
[1:38:54] this is what's wrong with your
[1:38:56] little boy there's an old country doctor
[1:39:00] who can perform this surgery
[1:39:04] now
[1:39:04] i wonder how many others
[1:39:06] right there on the platform
[1:39:09] where the angel of the lord just
[1:39:11] as he came
[1:39:12] and just sovereignly
[1:39:14] just spoke in that moment
[1:39:16] you have to you have to step back and
[1:39:18] remember
[1:39:19] god already knows all things
[1:39:23] god is not acting now contrary to his
[1:39:27] word
[1:39:30] god is acting according to his word
[1:39:36] but think about what that man felt like
[1:39:38] i've often put myself in those shoes
[1:39:40] when i've read that story many times
[1:39:42] i've reflected on that
[1:39:44] because you feel like when brother
[1:39:46] braham said he was disappointed you feel
[1:39:47] that
[1:39:50] think about what brother branham must
[1:39:51] have felt knowing what this man he had
[1:39:54] had
[1:39:55] they sacrificed to come to that meeting
[1:40:03] but you know
[1:40:05] there is a statement
[1:40:08] that the greatest
[1:40:10] surgeons in the nation at that time mayo
[1:40:14] clinic
[1:40:15] and they had made a statement concerning
[1:40:17] this boy
[1:40:19] this situation is inoperable
[1:40:24] nobody can operate on it i don't know
[1:40:26] about you but to me
[1:40:28] i look at these things and i see it in a
[1:40:30] spiritual context
[1:40:33] god let it be known that these who were
[1:40:36] regarded as the most astute and affluent
[1:40:40] and the most
[1:40:41] uh sublime of surgeons and god said i've
[1:40:45] got a little old new name country doctor
[1:40:48] that can do that
[1:40:50] what was god letting you and i know that
[1:40:52] it doesn't take a name to do something
[1:40:55] god was letting us know that it doesn't
[1:40:57] take something big or what we look at in
[1:41:00] our minds and say oh yeah that's
[1:41:01] acceptable
[1:41:05] here he's walking on the street
[1:41:07] he's down i know you know this testimony
[1:41:09] maybe some don't he's walking on the
[1:41:12] street the next day
[1:41:13] down
[1:41:15] and here's a lady who comes and the lady
[1:41:18] as she comes across she says what's
[1:41:21] wrong with your
[1:41:22] little boy
[1:41:23] he begins to tell her
[1:41:25] and she says oh you know what she said
[1:41:28] there's a right outside of town here
[1:41:29] there's a there's there's a doctor right
[1:41:31] outside of town here you got to go out
[1:41:33] on this road and you know he he operates
[1:41:35] on those things
[1:41:37] and you know what the man did this is
[1:41:39] brother brown telling it in the story i
[1:41:40] love it
[1:41:42] the man just kept walking right after
[1:41:44] that
[1:41:46] but he got a block away
[1:41:48] and he realized
[1:41:50] wait a minute what was said last night
[1:41:52] on the platform and what this woman just
[1:41:55] said he turns around and he runs and he
[1:41:58] says
[1:41:58] ma'am where did you say that doctor was
[1:42:03] amen
[1:42:04] you know what he was doing
[1:42:07] he had to submit his will
[1:42:10] to god's will
[1:42:14] his will is no different from what you
[1:42:16] and i would have wanted
[1:42:17] we want to see our children well you
[1:42:19] want to see this or our bodies to feel
[1:42:21] well and and to look at it in that way
[1:42:23] we would be looking at it let me tell
[1:42:25] you what the glory was
[1:42:27] is he was will he was able
[1:42:29] by the grace of god
[1:42:31] to surrender his will
[1:42:34] to the will of god
[1:42:36] and the surgery was performed
[1:42:39] and the baby was made whole
[1:42:42] it may not happen the way we think it's
[1:42:44] going to happen
[1:42:45] but don't let that stop you from
[1:42:46] marching
[1:42:48] it may not be going like you think it
[1:42:50] should be going but don't let it stop
[1:42:52] you from marching
