[34:27] the scripture tonight let's just bow our
[34:29] heads Heavenly Father Lord we're so
[34:31] thankful for a a
[34:34] faith that's been proven Lord we read
[34:37] through the book of Hebrews the 11th
[34:39] chapter they were saw aund they were fed
[34:42] to liance but to Lions but by faith they
[34:45] quenched the violence of
[34:47] fire they overthrew kingdoms though they
[34:51] watered in sheep skins and in deserts
[34:53] they dwelt in caves and yet the world
[34:55] was not worthy of and I'm so grateful
[34:58] tonight Lord you've never left yourself
[35:00] without a witness but though the fire is
[35:02] Raging tonight and though there's trials
[35:04] in our lives there's a people here that
[35:06] are standing on the same word of God
[35:08] that Abraham stood on that Moses stood
[35:10] on that Paul stood on that Peter stood
[35:11] on and tonight we're thankful because
[35:14] it's real to us it's more than just a
[35:17] church Creed it's more than just
[35:18] something we've heard rehearsed time and
[35:21] time again from the pulpit but it's our
[35:23] Our Testimony amen it's our testimony
[35:26] tonight we're so grateful for that kind
[35:28] of a testimony that's the kind of
[35:29] testimony that overcomes the enemy in
[35:32] the darkest and most wicked times Lord
[35:35] we thank you tonight we ask now you just
[35:36] come bless the reading of the word and
[35:38] the ministering thereof father there's
[35:40] many going through trials even tonight

[35:45] still fear no evil because you promised
[35:47] to be with us and Lord we just Commit
[35:49] This Time in your hands now we're
[35:50] grateful that you're here tonight I'm
[35:52] grateful for these that have shown up
[35:54] but most of all Lord you showed up
[35:56] tonight and you're going to show up and
[35:58] you're going to keep showing up you'll

[36:13] the mighty name above every other name
[36:16] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[36:17] the bride says am amen God bless you if
[36:20] you have your Bibles tonight let's look
[36:21] into the book of Nehemiah once
[36:24] again I think I've done the different
[36:26] ones except this one so uh Nehemiah the
[36:29] fth chapter and uh our hero has been
[36:32] through many kinds of situations that
[36:35] we've talked about and uh we're going to
[36:37] look here in Nehemiah the 5ifth chapter
[36:39] tonight he's got to deal with a really
[36:42] rough group of people tonight it's not
[36:44] the guy trying to kill him it's not the
[36:45] guy throwing stones it's not the guy
[36:46] trying to stop him from rebuilding the
[36:48] wall tonight he's going to deal with
[36:49] some church folk
[36:51] tonight amen well praise the Lord I
[36:53] thought a few more you'd laugh about
[36:55] that well praise the the Lord you must
[36:57] all just get along just fine that's good
[36:59] praise God never had a church problem
[37:02] never had a fuss never had somebody well
[37:05] praise God well for us that have had to
[37:08] deal with that I find this uh it's
[37:11] interesting to mean you'll get there if
[37:13] you haven't yet so Nehemiah the fth
[37:15] chapter we're just going to read the
[37:16] first 19 verses here actually is that
[37:18] the whole chapter it might that's the
[37:20] whole chapter well praise the lord we
[37:21] got a whole chapter in today we will
[37:23] here in about two minutes but verse one
[37:25] it says there was a great Cry of the
[37:27] people and of their wives against their
[37:28] Brethren the Jews for there were that
[37:31] said and they said this he said our we
[37:34] our sons and our daughters are many
[37:38] therefore excuse me I just lost my spot
[37:40] therefore we take up corn for them that
[37:41] we may eat and live some also there were
[37:45] that said we have mortgaged our lands
[37:47] Vineyards and houses that we might buy
[37:50] corn because of the dir there were also
[37:53] that said we have borrowed money for the
[37:54] king's tribute and that Upon Our lands
[37:57] and Vineyards yet now our flesh is as
[38:00] the Flesh of our Brethren our children
[38:02] as their children and lo we bring into
[38:04] bondage our sons and our daughters to be
[38:08] servants and some of our daughters are
[38:10] brought unto bondage already neither is
[38:12] it in our power to redeem them for other
[38:15] men have our lands and Vineyards notice
[38:19] Nehemiah says and I was very angry when
[38:21] I heard their cry in these words then I
[38:24] consulted with myself and I rebuked the
[38:27] Nobles and the rulers and said unto them
[38:30] ye exact user everyone of his brother
[38:33] and I set a great assembly against them
[38:35] and I said unto them we after our
[38:38] ability have redeemed our Brethren the
[38:41] Jews which were sold unto the Heathen
[38:44] and will you even sell your brethren or
[38:46] shall they be sold unto us then held
[38:49] they their peace and found nothing to
[38:52] answer and I said it is not good that ye
[38:55] do all ought you not to walk in the fear
[38:59] of our God because of the reproach of
[39:01] the Heathen our enemies I likewise and
[39:04] my brethren and my servants might exact
[39:06] of them money and corn I pray you let us
[39:09] leave off this Usery restore I pray you
[39:12] to them even this day amen their lands
[39:15] their Vineyards their Olive yards and
[39:17] their houses also the H hundredth part
[39:19] of the money and of the
[39:21] Corn the wine and the oil that you exact
[39:24] of them and they said we will restore
[39:25] them and we
[39:26] and will require nothing of them so will
[39:29] we do as thou sayest then I called the
[39:31] priests and took an oath of them that
[39:33] they should do according to this promise
[39:35] and I shook my lap and said so God shake
[39:38] out every man from his house and from
[39:40] his labor that performeth not this
[39:42] promise even thus be he shaken out and
[39:45] emptied and all the congregation said
[39:47] amen and praised God and the people did
[39:49] this according to this promise more from
[39:54] that time I was appointed to be their
[39:55] governor in the land of Judah from the
[39:57] 20th year even unto the 2 and 30th year
[39:59] of arch Xerxes the king that is 12 years
[40:02] I my bre have not eaten of the bread of
[40:03] the governor but the former governors
[40:06] that had been before me were chargeable
[40:07] unto the people and had taken of them
[40:09] Bread and Wine beside 40 shekels of
[40:11] silver yay even their servants bear rule
[40:13] over the people but so did not I because
[40:17] of the fear of God we'll just stop there
[40:19] tonight may the Lord bless the Read's Bo
[40:21] you may be
[40:22] seated I'd like to speak on a thought
[40:25] tonight the this is a legal word so I'll
[40:28] have to you know might have to Google it
[40:31] I'm Googling people it's great the
[40:34] adjudicator the adjudicator of a greater
[40:36] world we look at our opening scripture
[40:38] here in Nehemiah the 5th chapter and uh
[40:41] just in case uh the it's a little harder
[40:43] to follow there's a group of people they
[40:45] come to Nehemiah and their concerns they
[40:47] had to borrow money just to pay the
[40:49] king's tribute in other words they're
[40:50] borrowing money just to get by a couple
[40:52] of us probably know what I'm talking
[40:53] about tonight amen amen they're just
[40:55] they're Bor they're deep in debt they've
[40:57] mortgaged their lands and now their sons
[40:59] and daughters are in servitude and
[41:01] they've got no way to repay their
[41:02] creditors because they don't even have
[41:03] their lands so in other words they're
[41:05] they're so deep in debt because the
[41:07] bondage is so heavy they just come back
[41:09] to this land they've got nothing there
[41:11] they got no food or anything laid up so
[41:13] they they put themselves in debt to try
[41:15] to stay and to rebuild this wall and to
[41:17] do the work of God and now they're
[41:18] deeper in debt they've ever been before
[41:20] and they're selling their sons and
[41:21] daughters as servants into into slavery
[41:24] amen and I really like this is one of
[41:26] the reasons I really like Nehemiah U my
[41:28] son and and the guy in the Bible but um
[41:30] this guy he doesn't he doesn't mess
[41:32] around I like he just he gets angry and
[41:34] he just deals with it he calls the
[41:35] Nobles and the rulers together and he
[41:37] rebukes them for exacting Usery on their
[41:39] Brethren which they we're not supposed
[41:41] to do in the first place according to
[41:42] the law amen according to Leviticus the
[41:44] 25th chapter it says take thou no user
[41:47] of him or increase but fear thy God that
[41:50] theyy brother may live with thee so when
[41:53] you reading the law about the the law of
[41:55] borrowing when they lended to their
[41:57] brother they weren't supposed to exact
[41:58] Usery or take interest or whatever of
[42:00] them the whole purpose of this he says
[42:02] fear God that your brother may live with
[42:05] you in other words if you're going to
[42:06] lend something to your brother if you're
[42:08] going to help him out do it so that he
[42:09] can continue to live with you you're
[42:11] helping him out you're not taking
[42:13] advantage of him amen praise the Lord
[42:16] somebody so it's it's it's it's relevant
[42:18] not just what the law of Moses says but
[42:22] but why it's that way amen the purpose
[42:24] of the lenting was to help the brother
[42:25] out not to put them in bondage now these
[42:27] people they just come out of bondage
[42:30] amen they'd been there for 70 years and
[42:32] their fathers before them and they've
[42:34] been in Babylon they've been in
[42:35] different places and they were bound
[42:37] they were in bondage they just got out
[42:39] of bondage and right away immediately
[42:41] they find themselves in the same
[42:43] situations now their sons and daughters
[42:45] being sold slaves and listen it's not
[42:47] because they were just spending too much
[42:49] money they wanted to go to Disneyland or
[42:50] they just didn't know how to control
[42:51] their listen they're just trying to get
[42:53] by amen but they find find themselves in
[42:56] binding agreements and and according to
[42:58] the law of lending that they would have
[43:00] probably had there they were
[43:01] contractually obligated but the whole
[43:03] system's rigged against them if we could
[43:05] say it this way kind of like what we got
[43:06] today in America amen the whole thing's
[43:08] just rigged against you you look at your
[43:09] house loans and you look at credit cards
[43:11] and I won't get to preaching all and all
[43:13] that tonight amen but listen the SI the
[43:15] system is not rigged in your favor I'll
[43:16] just say it that way amen it's designed
[43:18] to take advantage of you the the people
[43:20] that are on the lower end of the income
[43:22] bracket the people praise the lord it's
[43:25] it's designed to do that amen and I love
[43:28] it because Nehemiah this great social
[43:30] reformer if I could call him this he
[43:32] calls out these wealthy Nobles and
[43:33] rulers he says listen we just redeemed
[43:36] our Brethren back we literally just got
[43:39] them back to the land a couple months
[43:40] ago we finally got them free we got them
[43:43] this place where they're not in bondage
[43:44] and you're going to turn right around
[43:46] and sell them right back into their into
[43:48] bondage you ought not to do this and
[43:51] these men they couldn't answer because
[43:52] they realized they were caught dead to
[43:53] rights they were literally putting the
[43:55] people right back in the thing that they
[43:58] just came out of amen and he says this
[44:00] thing that you do is not good ought you
[44:03] not to walk notice what he says in the
[44:05] fear of God the same thing the
[44:07] Commandment said fear the lord your God
[44:09] that your brother might live with you
[44:13] amen can I say it this way listen if you
[44:14] say that you love God whom you've seen
[44:18] but you can't love your brother who you
[44:20] who you whom you've seen I mean you you
[44:21] love God whom you've not seen how can
[44:23] you say you don't love your brother whom
[44:25] you have seen amen
[44:26] in other words if you really love God
[44:28] you love your brother you love one
[44:29] another because the Bible commands us to
[44:31] do that but more than that because it's
[44:33] in your heart to do that amen and so
[44:36] Nehemiah calls him out listen if you
[44:37] really cared about these people if you
[44:39] really cared about them you wouldn't be
[44:40] doing this you're taking advantage of
[44:42] them in the weakest place in their life
[44:45] amen am amen and he makes the point
[44:50] listen we could have done the same thing
[44:51] to you as rulers we could charge you
[44:53] taxes and we could take advantage of you
[44:55] but we we chose not to do that because
[44:57] we fear God Amen so in other words this
[45:00] great price that was paid I've talked
[45:02] about it before but there was a great
[45:03] price that was paid to set these people
[45:05] free amen it doesn't make sense to have
[45:08] paid and done so much to get them out of
[45:11] bondages not righteous to put them right
[45:14] back in amen what amazes me about this
[45:18] and and this is this is a whole study on
[45:19] this book but you know what amazes me
[45:21] about this is we talked about toaya many
[45:23] times one of the you had sambot and
[45:25] tobia these different men that come
[45:26] against um Nehemiah that come against
[45:29] the work there of rebuilding in
[45:30] Jerusalem you know here's tobah he's
[45:33] sent threatening letters to Nehemiah
[45:35] he's uh he's he's basically tried to get
[45:37] him killed he's he's subverted the work
[45:39] of God he's withstood what God is trying
[45:42] to do it every every opportunity that he
[45:44] gets amen he s out threatening letters
[45:46] and everything else and yet by the end
[45:47] of this book when you go when when
[45:50] Nehemiah he leaves for a few days and he
[45:51] comes back who is it that's dwelling in
[45:54] the very House of God but but
[45:56] tobiah the very enemy that had opposed
[46:00] the work of God is living in the house
[46:02] of God in a chamber and why this amazes
[46:04] me why I say this is you know why he got
[46:06] away with it he was married into the
[46:08] family he was married into the
[46:10] priesthood you know oh that's my buddy I
[46:12] go hunting with them that's my family
[46:14] well my family's got this rule I got
[46:16] different rules and they would literally
[46:17] take their own people and put them in
[46:19] bondage yet they let the enemy come in
[46:21] and give them free
[46:23] housing in the temple me out somebody
[46:26] amen they're going to put all these
[46:28] people back in slavery and the Very ones
[46:30] trying to bring him into bondage they're
[46:32] giving him a free
[46:34] pass see if we don't watch it we'll do
[46:36] what they do that's what the Jews did in
[46:38] the days of Jesus they would strained a
[46:39] KN but they'll swallow a camel they'll
[46:42] hold you accountable for the littlest
[46:44] things if you're a Pharisee if you're a
[46:46] special person they'll let you get away
[46:48] with
[46:50] murder amen see if we're not careful we
[46:53] let Tobi live in our house amen we're so
[46:56] busy trying to fix everybody else's
[46:57] lives up and trying to micromanage
[46:59] everybody else but we got a Tobi living
[47:01] in our house amen we'll let strife and
[47:04] lust and variance and envy and addiction
[47:06] and backbiting come right into our homes
[47:08] right in our lives and we'll let it run
[47:10] rampant but we'll fight somebody over
[47:12] Christmas well it's that time of the
[47:14] year it's the most oh I better not sing
[47:16] that
[47:18] song now listen I'm not here tonight to
[47:20] preach what you should do with that or
[47:21] not but listen we we'll take stuff in
[47:23] this message and we'll fight you to the
[47:25] death over it and we'll run everybody
[47:28] down and we'll burn every bridge and
[47:29] we'll fight somebody but we'll have
[47:31] bitterness we'll have Strife we'll have
[47:33] a bad attitude we'll get a wrong Spirit
[47:36] we justify that well listen I ain't got
[47:39] this in my home but you got the devil in
[47:41] your home and he's ruining your
[47:42] testimony he's ruining your joy he's
[47:44] taking away the blessing of God from you
[47:46] and you'll let that thing run rampid so
[47:48] you can nitpick somebody else to
[47:50] death amen
[47:52] somebody listen I'm not I'm not here to
[47:54] all fight y'all tonight am amen amen
[47:57] we'll fight people over they're too
[47:59] quiet in church or they're too loud and
[48:01] yet we've got major problems in our life
[48:04] amen if the preacher Don't Preach your
[48:05] pet Doctrine you'll get all puffed up
[48:08] with him and yet things aren't even
[48:09] right in your own house Amen brother B
[48:12] talk about a story and it's in God of
[48:14] being misunderstood I'm just going to
[48:15] paraphrase it for the sake of time
[48:17] brother BR tells this story this this
[48:18] guy come up to him and he was all like
[48:19] brother brandom you got this this girl
[48:21] playing piano in the church and brother
[48:22] brand said she was new in the way and
[48:24] you know she had a good spirit about her
[48:26] but she just wasn't really acclimated to
[48:27] things yet and her hair hair was short
[48:29] amen not justifying that now but he's
[48:32] telling you where she's at she's just a
[48:33] new believer amen and her skirt wasn't
[48:35] quite right and all this stuff and this
[48:36] man coming against brother Brandman it's
[48:38] funny brother BR kind of takes a shot
[48:39] back at
[48:41] him amen well listen and we we believe
[48:44] in Holiness amen but he makes this point
[48:47] you know that when he was confronted you
[48:49] know brother makes it clear he didn't
[48:50] approve of how she looked that he didn't
[48:52] endorse that or whatever but he said
[48:54] this same person had an his church well
[48:57] that tells you kind of what he was
[48:58] dealing with I guess he said the same
[48:59] person had in his church a lady who had
[49:01] long hair and wore long dresses and had
[49:04] a temper enough to fight a buzs saw just
[49:08] as mean as she could be praise God I
[49:12] hope you're not here tonight hope she's
[49:14] streaming just as mean she's got long
[49:17] hair and a long dress just as mean as
[49:19] she could be says long hair and long
[49:21] skirts don't take you to heaven no sir
[49:24] it's the spirit takes you to heaven can
[49:28] I say this way if you got the right kind
[49:29] of a spirit it'll produce the right kind
[49:31] of a life amen but you can try to live
[49:34] right that doesn't mean anything so he's
[49:36] sitting there in his eyeball looking for
[49:38] mistakes hey brother Brandon I thought
[49:39] you were a Pentecostal preacher you I
[49:41] thought you preached Holiness amen see
[49:44] that was easy to
[49:46] see that's what it was it was easy to
[49:49] see see be careful when you're not
[49:51] trying to when you're trying to run
[49:52] everybody else's lives you you don't
[49:54] have to buy it in your house amen
[49:56] cuz what you'll end up doing instead of
[49:57] living closer to God you just get better
[49:59] at hiding what you're doing
[50:01] wrong that's what a lot of people do in
[50:03] church amen they're not actually getting
[50:05] closer to God they just find out how to
[50:07] hide their sin better amen well the
[50:09] preacher thinks I'm a good person the
[50:10] Deacon thinks I'm good and so mommy
[50:12] thinks I'm good and Daddy thinks I'm
[50:13] good but God sees everything amen God is
[50:16] Not mocked he is not deceived
[50:19] amen that's what a lot praise the Lord
[50:23] that's that's what a legalist will do a
[50:24] lot of times they can tell everything
[50:26] about where you're wrong at amen cuz
[50:28] you're not fake about it amen it's all
[50:30] on display that's why they see it so
[50:32] easy amen many times they're putting
[50:34] everybody else in bondage like these
[50:35] guys were doing they put everybody else
[50:37] in bondage with their expectations and
[50:39] their ideas and I know better than
[50:40] everybody else amen but deep down they
[50:43] do it because they know if everybody
[50:44] else isn't good enough that justifies
[50:46] the sin they know they got in their own
[50:47] life amen well PR youall get quiet on me
[50:50] tonight you're not all a bunch of
[50:52] legalists so I mean you should be okay
[50:54] with this listen
[50:56] well and this is not just a preacher but
[50:57] as a preacher yeah I've had people come
[50:59] to me and say well I don't see this how
[51:01] you preach it this way and this and that
[51:02] that's all right they're finding to
[51:03] disagree with me I ain't got no problem
[51:05] with that amen it's a free country that
[51:06] we used to have here yes right brother
[51:09] Brian a nice country you used to have
[51:12] they're allowed to do that that's fine
[51:13] but they will they they'll nitpick
[51:15] because they think that you present a
[51:16] certain thing wrong and they're in deep
[51:18] sin they've got real problems and I'm
[51:21] not saying that to condemn them I'm
[51:22] saying what they need is to get out of
[51:24] sin and in trying to put everybody else
[51:26] in bondage we need to get out of bondage
[51:29] amen let's not try to take the Moto of
[51:31] somebody's eye we got to beam in ours
[51:33] that's what I saying
[51:35] amen praise the Lord see God is not
[51:38] judging us based on what everybody else
[51:39] sees about us God is not judging us
[51:42] tonight based on what everybody else's
[51:43] opinion about us is amen that's what
[51:46] makes him a righteous judge he sees it
[51:48] all he says he sees every wrong motive
[51:51] he sees all the pettiness amen he sees
[51:54] all the duplicity
[51:56] so these people you know what as long as
[51:58] nehemiah's watched them they're going to
[51:59] behave themselves but as soon as
[52:01] Nehemiah steps away for a few days they
[52:03] go right back into the very things they
[52:05] did before amen they take people right
[52:07] back into bondage
[52:09] amen you know I was I was studying this
[52:11] a while back brother B talks about the
[52:13] the vision he's seen in the preview of
[52:15] the Bride he talks about some different
[52:16] places but he talks about in the
[52:18] Masterpiece message in in particular
[52:21] this really caught my attention when I
[52:22] was studying this this one time because
[52:24] you know he talks about the preview the
[52:25] bride he's seen a bride at the beginning
[52:27] and he sees all the different nations
[52:28] they're all marching then he sees the
[52:30] American church at the end she's
[52:31] basically naked she's dancing the rock
[52:33] and roll doing all this stuff and he
[52:35] gets discouraged but then the voice
[52:37] tells the bride will come into preview
[52:38] again and he begins to see a bride she's
[52:41] marching that song something like he
[52:42] said Onward Christian Soldiers and she's
[52:44] marching and she's keeping beat and and
[52:47] and we all know there's there's two
[52:48] three uh sisters or whatever was at the
[52:50] end of the vision they start getting out
[52:52] of line and brother bam calls he says
[52:54] get back in line stay in line now we've
[52:57] heard that a lot of times before I've
[52:59] heard it many times but it's interesting
[53:00] because in this quote here in the
[53:01] Masterpiece brother B says this I have
[53:03] to watch her she'll get out of step with
[53:06] that word if I don't watch when she's
[53:08] passing
[53:09] by think about that now if she gets by
[53:12] maybe it'll be my time when I'm overse
[53:15] when I'm finished or whatever it is in
[53:16] other words whenever as long as she got
[53:18] out of line and he was there to watch
[53:20] they would get back in line but his
[53:22] concern was if I'm not there to watch it
[53:24] what are they going to do
[53:25] see if nobody's watching you how you
[53:27] going to act when nobody's there to say
[53:29] hey you need to do this you need to do
[53:31] that amen and I'm thinking if brother
[53:32] Brenham saw that in the
[53:35] 1960s where are we at today in this
[53:38] generation I'm saying this for a reason
[53:41] tonight amen I'm not just trying to wax
[53:43] poetic but I'm saying this for a reason
[53:44] tonight amen if if brother Brandon were
[53:46] to visit some churches that call
[53:47] themselves message churches and his name
[53:50] wasn't William brandom they'd be the
[53:51] first ones to kick him out and man it's
[53:54] easy to CL CL the message when there's
[53:56] no message to tell you you're not
[53:57] preaching what he preached
[53:59] amen praise the lord it's easy for us to
[54:02] present ourselves as message Believers
[54:04] when no one's holding us accountable and
[54:07] everybody thinks we're great praise the
[54:09] Lord somebody you say well how do you
[54:11] know they' kick him out cuz that's what
[54:13] they did to Christ in the latest SE age
[54:15] amen the church was the one that kicked
[54:17] him out behold I stand at the door and I
[54:21] knock amen you say we that's Christ
[54:23] you're talking about brother brandom
[54:24] that was the voice of God to this age
[54:27] it's no different than what they did
[54:28] with the prophet Samuel when they
[54:30] rejected Samuel they didn't reject the
[54:33] man they rejected his gift as a prophet
[54:35] cuz he spoke for God and when the
[54:38] churches of this generation they
[54:40] rejected the message God given they put
[54:42] Christ on the
[54:43] outside why cuz it's so easy to call
[54:47] yourself a church when Christ isn't
[54:49] there to tell you you're
[54:51] not it's easy to call yourself a
[54:53] Christian and live any kind of of a life
[54:55] when the word isn't there to evaluate
[54:57] and to judge and say what you're doing
[54:59] is wrong and the things that are
[55:00] preached today we preach all this
[55:02] Liberty and we preach lasciviousness and
[55:04] sin and all they've done to is give a
[55:07] license to to people to live any kind of
[55:10] a way listen that's not
[55:12] Liberty that's the same bondage they
[55:14] come out of and churches and preachers
[55:18] are putting people right back in the
[55:20] same bondage that God sent a message to
[55:22] get them out
[55:24] of
[55:26] hallelujah
[55:28] amen too many people today and it
[55:30] happens in message churches too we're
[55:32] obsessed with the blessings of God we're
[55:35] obsessed with the power of God but
[55:36] there's no fear of
[55:38] God there's no love of God and that's
[55:42] the only
[55:45] thing that's the only thing that'll get
[55:47] you over there amen it's not how blessed
[55:49] you are it's not how loud you are how
[55:51] intellectual you are it's do you have
[55:53] perfect love cuz if you love that
[55:55] brother you're not going to put him in
[55:56] bondage if you love that sister you're
[55:58] not going to lay a burden on him that
[55:59] you couldn't bear in the first
[56:01] place amen
[56:04] somebody praise the lord it's Christ
[56:08] he's on the outside today the church has
[56:10] rejected him the word they embrac the
[56:13] idea of a man named Jesus that lets him
[56:16] get away with whatever they but they've
[56:17] rejected the word that would not have
[56:19] let them go back into bondage amen but
[56:23] praise God because there's a people on
[56:25] the earth tonight amen we've got some of
[56:27] them here tonight they've recognized the
[56:28] word of God they've recognized the
[56:30] presence of God they're identified with
[56:32] the word of God they've invited him in
[56:35] they've made him feel welcome amen what
[56:37] does the scripture say come out from
[56:39] among them be ye separate say the Lord
[56:42] and touch not the unclean thing separate
[56:45] yourself from man's ideas separate

[57:04] thing separate yourself from your own
[57:07] ideas separate yourself from
[57:09] denominational thinking amen separate
[57:12] yourself from the leadership of man's
[57:15] thinking amen I I I think I preached
[57:17] about here last time talking about the
[57:18] over seers and the pastors they come and

[57:29] looks lost when all the false preachers
[57:31] when all that false church has scattered
[57:33] the people of God into all kinds of
[57:35] different places the Bible says this in
[57:37] verse 5 it says behold the days come
[57:40] sayith the Lord that I will raise unto
[57:42] David A righteous branch and the King

[58:05] his people cuz God made a promise God
[58:08] will not forsake them he cannot forsake
[58:10] them and he cannot forsake you and I
[58:12] amen God will set up a king over them
[58:15] after David this Bible says here verse
[58:17] six in his days Judah shall be saved
[58:19] Israel shall dwell safely and his name
[58:21] whereby he shall be called the Lord our
[58:25] righteousness Jehovah Sindu amen the

[59:30] friends

[1:00:46] going to come against him for the
[1:00:47] message of Grace and how he preached

[1:00:52] those men decided they were against that
[1:00:53] man William br him listen when he walked
[1:00:56] in that room that day he didn't have one
[1:00:58] friend with him except for the Lord

[1:01:19] amen am I I love the words of the
[1:01:22] Apostle Paul he says henceforth there is
[1:01:24] laid up for me a crown of righteousness
[1:01:27] which the Lord the righteous judge shall
[1:01:30] shall give me at that day and not to me
[1:01:33] only but to all them that love his
[1:01:37] appearing amen is there anybody here
[1:01:39] tonight say I love his appearing amen we
[1:01:42] love his appearing that's what we live
[1:01:44] for and listen if your heart wasn't
[1:01:46] right before God you should dread that
[1:01:48] or you would dread it or you should
[1:01:49] dread it amen because listen if you
[1:01:52] recognize he's coming back to judge the
[1:01:54] world he's also coming back to redeem a
[1:01:57] people amen so if you're right in the
[1:01:59] sight of God the coming of the Lord is
[1:02:01] to change this vile body unto a glorious
[1:02:04] body liken unto his own amen but if your
[1:02:08] heart's not right with God it doesn't
[1:02:09] matter who's impressed with you or who's
[1:02:10] your best buddy amen see the coming of
[1:02:14] the Lord doesn't change your

[1:02:29] like at
[1:02:30] church amen our character is not who we
[1:02:34] are when Nehemiah is looking amen it's
[1:02:38] not who we are when the pastor's
[1:02:39] watching us what do we like when no
[1:02:41] one's
[1:02:42] around do we have a life that's worthy
[1:02:45] of the Gospel amen listen stand for
[1:02:48] Christ in a message church tonight we're
[1:02:49] in a message church right listen if you
[1:02:52] stand for Christ here that's not really
[1:02:53] that hard
[1:02:55] I hope it's not
[1:02:57] anyway it's not really hard to say I
[1:02:59] Believe In Christ I'm going to stand for
[1:03:00] the that's easy to do in a group of
[1:03:03] people that all say and believe the same
[1:03:04] thing amen but what if you were the only
[1:03:07] one at your church that stood for the
[1:03:09] truth maybe at your job or work or your
[1:03:11] family listen some of you have been
[1:03:12] there before you know what I'm talking
[1:03:13] about you might have been the only one
[1:03:14] in your family that believed this word
[1:03:17] but you stood for them amen you stood
[1:03:19] for my mommy and daddy didn't stand for
[1:03:21] it when they didn't know and God
[1:03:23] rewarded you and you're here
[1:03:25] tonight amen well praise the Lord some
[1:03:28] of you got some of you got a great
[1:03:29] reward coming for that amen that'll make
[1:03:31] you a little happy tonight you know what
[1:03:33] I stood for Christ when it wasn't
[1:03:35] popular when it wasn't easy when it
[1:03:37] wasn't accepted when nobody else in my
[1:03:39] family when no one else that I knew was
[1:03:41] with me and yet I stood for him and he
[1:03:43] stood for
[1:03:45] me and the righteous judge he's laid up
[1:03:49] a crown I've got a crown waiting for me
[1:03:52] amen it's more than just a house it's
[1:03:55] more than just an address of the new
[1:03:56] city you got a crown waiting for you
[1:03:58] amen why cuz you stood for him when
[1:04:00] nobody else want to stand for
[1:04:02] him
[1:04:04] amen we talk about about this idea of
[1:04:07] adjudication I titled this the
[1:04:09] adjudicator greater World an adjudicator
[1:04:12] amen it's a it's a legal term to
[1:04:14] adjudicate it means to to render a
[1:04:17] Judicial opinion and so the the usage of
[1:04:19] it has evolved somewhat over time and
[1:04:23] the definition kind of differs depending
[1:04:24] on which country and stuff even but I
[1:04:26] want just just give you an idea what
[1:04:27] we're talking about let's take the idea
[1:04:29] of of arbitration for example amen when
[1:04:32] you have an arbitration you've got these
[1:04:33] two different parties and you know
[1:04:35] they're disputing over a certain point
[1:04:37] of the law or grievance so in the
[1:04:40] interests of avoiding a court proceeding
[1:04:43] they decide they're going to sit down
[1:04:44] and get an Arbiter or an arbitrator to
[1:04:47] sit down as an intermediary to come to
[1:04:50] an acceptable resolution in the hope
[1:04:53] that if they abide by the arbiter's
[1:04:55] findings that they can avoid going to
[1:04:56] court now this is the role of Christ in
[1:04:58] the church today amen the Bible tells us
[1:05:01] in in first Timothy chapter 2 verse 5
[1:05:04] there is one God and there's one
[1:05:06] mediator between God and Men the man
[1:05:09] Christ Jesus now I think it's noteworthy
[1:05:11] the scripture say the man Christ Jesus
[1:05:13] amen because the humanity of Christ is
[1:05:16] important in this context of IM mediator
[1:05:18] you say why because for the parties to
[1:05:20] have a mediator there must be some
[1:05:22] common ground for them to meet on so God
[1:05:26] could not meet you just as a Divine
[1:05:27] spirit in your Humanity in your Fallen
[1:05:30] nature so God had to come down because
[1:05:32] you couldn't get up to him amen he was
[1:05:35] the one that was that was that you you
[1:05:36] were the one that was guilty and he was
[1:05:38] the judge so he had to make a way cuz
[1:05:42] you couldn't make a way the law couldn't
[1:05:44] make a way your obedience couldn't make
[1:05:46] a way even your faith couldn't make way
[1:05:49] but it brought God down and so the man
[1:05:53] Christ Jesus he's the meteor he's the
[1:05:55] Common Ground that's mutually acceptable
[1:05:58] to both parties amen Christ is fully a
[1:06:01] man yet he's fully God
[1:06:05] Amen now I would just say this too
[1:06:08] because you know I some people some
[1:06:09] people I know they preach that he's no
[1:06:10] longer that now but for him to continue
[1:06:13] to be a mediator he must still be a man
[1:06:15] today amen now he's not just a man he's
[1:06:18] more than a man he's an eternal spirit
[1:06:20] he's living in his church but there is a
[1:06:22] body of Christ amen on the earth
[1:06:24] spiritually but he has a representation
[1:06:27] he's sitting tonight amen in Heavenly
[1:06:30] places and that's why our vile body
[1:06:32] shall be changed like his own he has a
[1:06:34] body he didn't dissolve and turn into
[1:06:36] nothing amen praise the Lord so he's
[1:06:40] still fully a man and yet fully God Amen
[1:06:43] it's the same reason according to
[1:06:44] Hebrews the 9th chapter that he is the
[1:06:47] mediator of the New Testament he's also
[1:06:49] the testator of this Testament because
[1:06:51] the last will and testament is of no no
[1:06:54] Force while the testator liveth the
[1:06:56] Bible says so in other words God as a
[1:06:58] spirit couldn't die for you to give you
[1:07:00] this inheritance but God through his son
[1:07:02] Jesus Christ died and rose again that
[1:07:05] you might be an heir of God and a joint
[1:07:09] heir of Jesus Christ amen through his
[1:07:11] death we receive the promise of Eternal
[1:07:14] inheritance
[1:07:15] amen praise the Lord
[1:07:18] hallelujah he's the only mediator
[1:07:22] tonight
[1:07:24] William Brand's not the mediator the
[1:07:27] Apostle Paul's not the mediator Christ
[1:07:29] is the only mediator of the New
[1:07:30] Testament because he's the only one the
[1:07:32] father permits to mediate amen so it has
[1:07:35] to be somebody that we that both parties
[1:07:37] agree to now there's many people today
[1:07:39] that don't want Christ to be the
[1:07:41] mediator they want a pope or a preacher
[1:07:43] or their favorite minister or whatever
[1:07:45] they've got different ideas they want
[1:07:46] open for Winfrey or whatever else they
[1:07:48] want some other person to be the the
[1:07:50] mediator but Christ is the only one that
[1:07:52] God agreed to amen that's why he's the
[1:07:56] only mediator
[1:07:57] amen now a man has a right to refuse the
[1:08:01] mediator legally amen and certainly do
[1:08:04] that today they reject the offer of
[1:08:06] Salvation given by Christ or maybe they
[1:08:09] try to find another mediator but listen
[1:08:11] it's in our best interests to accept
[1:08:14] this mediator amen because if both
[1:08:16] parties cannot reach a mutual agreement
[1:08:18] guess what their judge their case is
[1:08:21] taken to the judgment and this is where
[1:08:23] the adjudicator comes in amen see right
[1:08:27] now he is a mediator but always he is an
[1:08:29] adjudicator amen so this adjudicator it
[1:08:33] can be somebody that's nominated they're
[1:08:34] elected or maybe they're agreed upon but
[1:08:36] many times the the judge appoints the
[1:08:39] adjudicator amen he's a person that's
[1:08:41] appointed to judge a case and he
[1:08:44] appoints this adjudicator and once the
[1:08:46] adjudicator is appointed no no we're not
[1:08:49] all lawyers tonight but stay with me for
[1:08:50] a second we're not all lawyers but
[1:08:52] what's the adjudicator is appointed he
[1:08:55] has the legal authority to render any
[1:08:57] decision and the court upholds that
[1:09:00] decision amen the adjudicator can even
[1:09:02] set precedent for a case for something
[1:09:05] that's not even happened yet in other
[1:09:07] words he can literally say if this
[1:09:09] happens this is how we're going to
[1:09:10] handle it and the court upholds the
[1:09:13] decision of the adjudicator and whatever
[1:09:16] contingency he's laid out to expedite
[1:09:18] future cases amen so he can even
[1:09:21] determine ahead of time what the rules
[1:09:23] are and the court has to follow all that
[1:09:25] so I know this is all real Technical and
[1:09:27] I'm just kind of touching on it really
[1:09:28] and and I know you all didn't pay for
[1:09:29] your your college tuition to listen to
[1:09:31] business law 101 amen but the Arbiter
[1:09:35] the arbitrator is there to negotiate
[1:09:37] between two parties amen but the
[1:09:39] adjudicator is there to render a verdict
[1:09:42] amen now like I said Christ is the
[1:09:44] mediator of the New Covenant today but
[1:09:46] he will not always be that mediator
[1:09:48] there is a time he comes off The Mercy
[1:09:49] Seat amen but he is the adjudicator or
[1:09:52] the judge the by which the world will be
[1:09:54] judged
[1:09:55] amen John 5:22 says for the father
[1:09:59] judgeth no
[1:10:01] man right Jesus said the father judgeth
[1:10:03] no man but he hath committed all
[1:10:05] judgment unto the son that all men
[1:10:08] should honor the son even as they honor
[1:10:10] the father he that honth not the son
[1:10:14] honth not the Father which has sent him
[1:10:16] in other words you can't say you honor
[1:10:17] the judge if you don't honor the one
[1:10:18] he's sent to judge the case if you don't
[1:10:21] honor the adjudicator and you don't up
[1:10:22] you don't uphold or you don't abide by
[1:10:24] what he says then how can you say you
[1:10:26] abide by the father
[1:10:28] amen verily verily I say un you he that
[1:10:31] heareth my word and believeth on him
[1:10:33] that sent me hath past tense hath
[1:10:36] everlasting life and shall not come into
[1:10:39] condemnation but is passed from Death
[1:10:42] unto life now how could he say that
[1:10:45] because the Judgment hasn't come yet he
[1:10:46] can say it because he's an adjudicator
[1:10:48] he can saved because it's his right to
[1:10:50] declare if you do this your verdict has
[1:10:53] already been rendered you've already
[1:10:55] passed from death into life no man can
[1:10:58] change it there's no higher court of
[1:11:00] appeal there's no Double Jeopardy no one
[1:11:02] can overturn
[1:11:04] that it's already been
[1:11:07] settled barely verely I say unto you the
[1:11:10] hour is coming and now is that was 2,000
[1:11:14] years ago what about tonight the hour is
[1:11:17] coming and now is when the dead shall
[1:11:19] hear the voice of the son of man and
[1:11:22] they that hear shall live for as the
[1:11:25] father hath life in himself so ha he
[1:11:28] given to the son to have life in himself
[1:11:31] and ha given him authority to execute
[1:11:34] judgment also because he is the Son of
[1:11:38] Man Marvel not at
[1:11:40] this and that's pretty wild Marvel not
[1:11:43] at this for the hour is coming which all
[1:11:47] that are in the graves shall hear his
[1:11:49] voice and shall come forth they that
[1:11:51] have done good under the resurrection of
[1:11:53] life and they that have done Evil under
[1:11:55] the resurrection of damnation I can of
[1:11:58] my own self do nothing listen he did not
[1:12:02] presume this Authority he say you know
[1:12:05] what I want to be the judge of the world
[1:12:06] I'm going to go down there and judge
[1:12:07] everybody like some of my church people
[1:12:10] do
[1:12:12] amen I'm not doing this of my own accord
[1:12:14] I didn't do this of myself he was
[1:12:17] appointed to
[1:12:18] it as I hear I judge Amen in other words
[1:12:23] he's he's heard all the legal EAS he
[1:12:25] knows exactly what it takes amen he says
[1:12:28] as I hear I judge and my judgment is
[1:12:30] just because I seek not my own will but
[1:12:35] the will of the Father which ha sent me
[1:12:39] amen now since he's the adjudicator he
[1:12:41] represents the full authority of the
[1:12:43] will of the justice system he can issue
[1:12:46] a ruling before the appointed time and
[1:12:48] that judgment will be upheld this is why
[1:12:51] Jesus says in St John chap 12 notice
[1:12:53] what he says says here now the Bible is
[1:12:55] not contradicting itself he's showing
[1:12:57] you something he says if anyone hears my
[1:12:59] words and believe not I judge him not
[1:13:03] well no wait I thought you said he was
[1:13:04] the judge watch but he's already issued
[1:13:06] something is what it is I judge him not
[1:13:10] for I came not to judge the world but to
[1:13:13] save the world well now wait a minute if
[1:13:16] you're trying to save the world then
[1:13:17] where's the Judgment come in notice he
[1:13:19] that rejecteth me and receiveth not my
[1:13:21] words hath won judge him the word that I
[1:13:26] have
[1:13:27] spoken the same shall judge him in the
[1:13:29] last day in other words listen I'm here
[1:13:31] to try to save everybody but if they
[1:13:33] don't receive this the judgment is
[1:13:34] already there amen they're not going to
[1:13:37] get condemned they were already
[1:13:39] condemned we all come to the world born
[1:13:42] separated from God come into the world
[1:13:44] speaking Liv we were condemned from the
[1:13:46] GetGo but there was one that come to
[1:13:47] bail us
[1:13:49] out he doesn't need to go find everybody
[1:13:52] guilty sin the law has already concluded
[1:13:55] that but he found some that says but you
[1:13:58] know what I'll take that plea bargain
[1:14:00] I'll take that deal there's one that
[1:14:02] made a way for me out my sin had to be
[1:14:05] judged he couldn't be brushed away it
[1:14:07] couldn't be put in a closet somewhere
[1:14:09] but somebody's paying for it and if you
[1:14:12] receive him you receive life amen you've
[1:14:15] all already
[1:14:18] passed from Death unto
[1:14:22] life listen I believe that's what
[1:14:23] brother B saw in 1963 he sees the cloud
[1:14:26] amen he sees this wigged one and he
[1:14:28] began to ask different people I think he
[1:14:30] talks about he he asked brother Jack
[1:14:32] Moore why does Christ have white hair
[1:14:35] brother Jack said well that's his
[1:14:36] glorified body that's that's just how he
[1:14:38] looks now brother said it just didn't
[1:14:41] ring true to him for some
[1:14:42] reason amen it just didn't ring true
[1:14:45] with him he began to look and he was
[1:14:46] look in the Book of Daniel in the Bible
[1:14:48] begin to talk in the Book of Daniel
[1:14:49] about the Ancient of Days whose hair was
[1:14:52] like pure well and again in Revelation
[1:14:54] the first chapter when John turns to see
[1:14:56] the voice that spoke to him and he
[1:14:58] beholds one like the son of man what
[1:15:00] does he see his head and his hair were
[1:15:03] white as the
[1:15:04] snow and brother BR says this in 1965
[1:15:07] trying to do got a service he says he's
[1:15:09] wigged with that white angel wig
[1:15:12] Hallelujah that the message of him being
[1:15:15] God is the truth he is the Supreme judge
[1:15:19] of the universe Supreme judge of Heaven
[1:15:22] and Earth
[1:15:23] he is God and nothing else but God he is
[1:15:27] God expressed in human form called the
[1:15:30] son of man which the son was the man
[1:15:33] Hallelujah in case you didn't catch it
[1:15:35] yet clarifies it if that don't make our
[1:15:38] message exactly right identified by the
[1:15:41] scripture identified in service
[1:15:43] identified by his presence the same
[1:15:45] yesterday today and forever therefore
[1:15:49] those seven seals are the truth Brethren
[1:15:52] amen amen
[1:15:53] why does he appear as a judge at the end
[1:15:56] of seven Church changes now we know he's
[1:15:58] going to judge the world actually his
[1:15:59] word is going to judge the world so why
[1:16:02] does he appear in this form brother say
[1:16:03] it's to vindicate that this message is
[1:16:06] the truth in other words to vindicate
[1:16:08] that this word is the word that will
[1:16:11] judge the world Amen he's rendered his
[1:16:13] opinion amen he's rendered his legal
[1:16:16] judgment already and this Cloud this
[1:16:18] judge appeared it speaks to you and I
[1:16:21] this message is the thing
[1:16:24] why is it after brother brandom preaches
[1:16:26] the opening of his seals he comes back
[1:16:28] and preaches an indictment why because
[1:16:30] it couldn't be judged amen it was a
[1:16:32] carrier of that life God used that but
[1:16:35] once the fullness of the word come once
[1:16:38] the judge validated this the word
[1:16:40] whereby I will judge the Gentile Nations
[1:16:43] now a verdict could be rendered that
[1:16:46] they were found weight in the balances
[1:16:48] they were found wanting
[1:16:50] amen now some people take this whole
[1:16:52] idea
[1:16:54] they take it out of
[1:16:55] context and they say well see Christ
[1:16:57] he's if he's judging he's no longer on
[1:17:01] The Mercy Seat he's come off that's why
[1:17:03] he preach the seals but listen if he's
[1:17:05] no longer mediating then no one can get
[1:17:07] saved because there's no other place to
[1:17:10] mediate
[1:17:11] Amen in other words it's no longer the
[1:17:13] New Testament therefore salvation have
[1:17:15] to come some other way other than what
[1:17:17] the scripture mentions and most of the
[1:17:19] people that preach that their way is
[1:17:21] their church doctrine or their
[1:17:22] Revelation or whatever it is and see
[1:17:24] what it does becomes a tool to put
[1:17:28] people in bondage just like we read
[1:17:30] about the beginning well if you don't
[1:17:32] see it my way or my Revelation or my
[1:17:36] church and it's a tool of fear to bring
[1:17:40] people into bondage amen but listen this
[1:17:43] word of God you can be in the middle of
[1:17:45] the desert you can be sitting in your
[1:17:47] home it doesn't matter you're Justified
[1:17:49] because he said it and you believe it
[1:17:52] and that settles it you don't need you
[1:17:53] don't need somebody else to judge or
[1:17:55] qualify that the Supreme judge has
[1:17:58] already put his stamp of approval on
[1:18:00] thus say the Lord through the prophet
[1:18:02] Malachi
[1:18:04] 4 it's Vindicated it's approved of God
[1:18:07] tonight the same thing that judges the
[1:18:08] denominations has set you and I free
[1:18:10] tonight
[1:18:13] Amen brother bam said I can show you
[1:18:15] where the god started the apostolic age
[1:18:17] you show me where he took it
[1:18:18] out it's funny we read that quote but
[1:18:21] you know what God put in the apostolic
[1:18:22] age
[1:18:23] 238 repent and be baptized every one of
[1:18:27] you in the name of Jesus Christ for for
[1:18:29] the remission of sins you shall receive
[1:18:32] the gift of the Holy Ghost that means
[1:18:35] tonight if you want the Holy Ghost you
[1:18:37] get the same way they got it back there
[1:18:38] in the book of Acts it's not a different
[1:18:40] Doctrine it's not a different kind of a
[1:18:42] message it's the fullness of what was
[1:18:46] preached
[1:18:49] amen so what does it mean if he's a
[1:18:51] mediator why is he judged why why is he
[1:18:54] wigged it testifies the Supreme
[1:18:56] judge has Vindicated this message amen
[1:19:00] that the word has been restored
[1:19:01] according to ma Malachi CH 4 Luke 17:30
[1:19:04] man-made systems have been judged that's
[1:19:08] why the prophet preaches their their
[1:19:09] Blasphemous names amen so even this is
[1:19:13] what I'm getting at they're still around
[1:19:14] today there's still denominational
[1:19:16] churches around today yet they've
[1:19:19] already been judged by the word
[1:19:24] amen Brotherman this future home message
[1:19:26] paragraph 3 385 he's talking about
[1:19:28] Isaiah the 4th chapter scripture we've
[1:19:30] probably heard many times but he says
[1:19:32] this in that day seven women shall take
[1:19:35] hold of one man saying we will eat our
[1:19:37] own bread wear our own apparel only let
[1:19:40] us be called by thy name to take away
[1:19:42] our reproach now I've heard this used
[1:19:43] different ways different times but
[1:19:45] brother B reads this scripture and he
[1:19:47] says that's at the end time where we're
[1:19:50] living
[1:19:51] now amen
[1:19:53] that's the condition of marriage and
[1:19:55] divorce today that's the spiritual
[1:19:56] condition of the churches today they all
[1:19:58] want to dress how they want they all
[1:19:59] want to feed on what they want but they
[1:20:01] want to be called Christians amen but
[1:20:03] the prophet said any church that puts
[1:20:05] aside the leadership of the Holy Ghost
[1:20:07] it's the world with his name attached to
[1:20:09] it so they want to claim the name of
[1:20:12] Jesus but they want to reject the word
[1:20:13] and the
[1:20:14] leadership it's already been
[1:20:17] condemned now this would be discouraging
[1:20:20] for many of us to say well this the day
[1:20:23] we live in but you know what there's
[1:20:24] there's more in that chapter besides
[1:20:25] that first
[1:20:27] verse he says in that day shall the
[1:20:30] branch of the Lord be beautiful and
[1:20:33] glorious and the fruit of the Earth
[1:20:34] shall be excellent and cly for them that
[1:20:37] are escaped of Israel and it shall come
[1:20:39] to pass that he that is left in Zion and
[1:20:41] he that remaineth in Jerusalem Shall be
[1:20:44] Called holy even everyone that is
[1:20:46] written among the living in Jerusalem
[1:20:48] when the Lord shall washed away the
[1:20:49] filth of the daughters of Zion and shall
[1:20:52] have purg the blood of Jerusalem from
[1:20:54] the midst thereof by the spirit of
[1:20:56] judgment and the spirit of burning and
[1:20:58] the Lord will create upon every Dwelling
[1:21:01] Place of Mount Zion and upon all her
[1:21:03] assemblies a cloud and smoke by day and
[1:21:07] The Shining of a flaming fire by night
[1:21:11] for upon all the glory shall be a
[1:21:14] defense Amen in other words God's going
[1:21:16] to put a light over your dwelling he's
[1:21:18] already put a cloud over it but he's
[1:21:19] going to put a light over your dwelling
[1:21:20] place it's the glory of God and the
[1:21:23] glory of God will be a defense to you in
[1:21:25] a generation when the world's falling
[1:21:27] apart when man's systems are falling
[1:21:29] apart and religion has failed there's a
[1:21:32] light there's a token over our homes
[1:21:35] amen though there's darkness in the land
[1:21:37] of Egypt there's light and go tonight
[1:21:39] amen we are not in darkness we are not
[1:21:42] sitting tonight in Gross Darkness we've
[1:21:44] got the light the light has appeared the
[1:21:47] Vindicated word has declared you're not
[1:21:50] guilty with the world you're not
[1:21:51] condemned with the world
[1:21:54] tonight brother Ram said that's the this
[1:21:56] what he says in future say that's the
[1:21:58] Holy Ghost and
[1:22:01] Fire amen it's the Holy Ghost and Fire
[1:22:04] and it's keeping me alive it's keeping
[1:22:07] you alive it's keeping us alive
[1:22:10] amen my my my
[1:22:14] my it is Justified it has cleansed it
[1:22:19] has regenerated us amen listen I believe
[1:22:22] tonight you don't have to wait to get a
[1:22:24] token any more than denomination has to
[1:22:26] wait to be judged it's here
[1:22:29] now amen the token is here now to
[1:22:32] testify every one of us was guilty every
[1:22:36] one of us deserved judgment but the
[1:22:37] mediator made us a deal he suffered and
[1:22:40] died for our sins and he rose again amen
[1:22:42] Heath made him to be sin who knew no sin
[1:22:46] that we might be made the
[1:22:50] righteousness Jehovah can do amen
[1:22:53] the Lord is our righteousness he is our
[1:22:56] righteousness and now we've been made
[1:22:59] his

[1:25:46] everything all the powers of Darkness

[1:27:37] really something if you're Billy Paul

[1:27:42] that means she knew you were going to
[1:27:42] make it hallelujah amen listen if God
[1:27:47] has declared a thing amen if brother B
[1:27:50] could look and see there's there I am
[1:27:51] Crossing with my wives and there's or
[1:27:53] manev listen that ought to give you so
[1:27:55] much encouragement because God can't
[1:27:57] change his mind about his judgment about
[1:28:03] you he said but I never been in the
[1:28:05] vision I never this I never that listen
[1:28:07] you've got a more sure word of Prophecy

[1:28:11] according to the scripture that's
[1:28:12] greater than the
[1:28:15] vision amenu that's greater actually
[1:28:20] brother said if one of these Visions
[1:28:21] wasn't according to the word to throw it
[1:28:22] out why cuz the word is the judge that's
[1:28:26] how you judge prophecy that's what you
[1:28:27] that's how you judge right or wrong the
[1:28:29] word is the judge and listen the same
[1:28:33] word judged the things in your life that
[1:28:36] are coming against you if you're sick
[1:28:37] tonight your sickness has already been
[1:28:39] judged I'm the Lord thy God which heals
[1:28:42] all your diseases amen that forgive us
[1:28:45] all that iniquities you know years
[1:28:49] ago I don't know who's going to catch
[1:28:51] this but whatever ever here we are who's
[1:28:54] listening but you know years ago I was
[1:28:55] in a church I might have told Brother
[1:28:57] Brian this story but I was in a church
[1:28:58] and I was I'd walked out my my son
[1:29:01] Nehemiah he was just a little baby at
[1:29:03] the time basically one or two I guess
[1:29:04] it's not a baby but you know how you
[1:29:06] know how parents are toddler whatever he
[1:29:10] was I took him out I'm in the vesle and
[1:29:12] there was this young lady she this is
[1:29:14] her first time being in church I'd never
[1:29:15] seen her there before and she was
[1:29:17] sitting up against the wall in the VES
[1:29:19] and I began to speak to her I said uh
[1:29:21] can I ask you what's going on said oh my
[1:29:22] head hurts I've never had a headache
[1:29:24] that's bad I feel sick I said can you
[1:29:27] wait here just a second I want to read
[1:29:28] something to you I grabbed my Bible and
[1:29:30] I I read Isaiah 53 to her that with his
[1:29:34] stripes I said now this is speaking of
[1:29:36] Christ I said you now listen this is not
[1:29:37] a church person this is not a scholar or
[1:29:40] a theologian just some young teenage
[1:29:43] girl I said now you read this does that
[1:29:45] speak of Christ she said yes I said Do
[1:29:48] you believe what this says she said yes
[1:29:50] I believe it I said then if you believe
[1:29:51] believe that then you're already healed
[1:29:55] according to the scripture and God
[1:29:56] raised her right up there that night and
[1:29:58] she walked right back to the service
[1:30:00] completely
[1:30:03] healed now that was a good testimony I'm
[1:30:05] like yeah praise God you know what's
[1:30:07] really funny I had somebody get offended
[1:30:08] about
[1:30:09] that they come and said well listen the
[1:30:11] preacher preaching this and that and
[1:30:13] stuff and and you should have waited
[1:30:14] this that I'm like I'm not going to make
[1:30:15] her weight with a headache listen Christ
[1:30:17] dealt with the same
[1:30:19] thing Christ well praise the Lord
[1:30:21] somebody well listen this this woman you
[1:30:24] there's seven days in a week you didn't
[1:30:25] have to heal her on the Sabbath you
[1:30:27] could have waited he said listen bunch
[1:30:29] of
[1:30:31] Hypocrites if you had an ox in the ditch
[1:30:35] on the Sabbath you'd get it out and
[1:30:37] ought not this daughter of Abraham be
[1:30:41] set free listen I'm not going to wait if
[1:30:45] she's got a need Christ is not waiting
[1:30:47] to render his verdict on it he's already
[1:30:50] spoken about it
[1:30:52] who am I to hold it
[1:30:56] back amen that girl when she was sitting
[1:30:59] there she didn't get healed she was
[1:31:00] already healed she just recognized
[1:31:03] it farby any man or any preacher any
[1:31:06] other person to try to hold that back
[1:31:10] listen I'm this is the way I see it if
[1:31:13] God hadn't already approved it he did
[1:31:14] there that's why I said well listen if
[1:31:17] you really had an issue with it you
[1:31:18] should take it up with the Lord cuz she
[1:31:20] got healed if you don't like it take it
[1:31:23] up with him wasn't me that did it it was
[1:31:25] the Lord that did it so I guess God made
[1:31:28] a mistake should have waited till the
[1:31:29] end of the
[1:31:30] service you see how the now that sounds
[1:31:33] funny but that's how the car that's how
[1:31:34] the religious mind is it puts the
[1:31:37] blessing over here listen one day you'll
[1:31:39] get delivered one day you'll be good
[1:31:41] enough one day you'll be accepted no
[1:31:43] you're accepted now because he said
[1:31:45] it if Satan can gets you to put off to
[1:31:47] another day brother Bim said that's as
[1:31:49] good as he wants it you'll never get get
[1:31:52] it just accept it's yours right now by
[1:31:56] faith it's

[1:32:05] grand opportunity tonight to do
[1:32:08] something
[1:32:11] amen it's more than just praying you say
[1:32:13] well it could be greater than praying
[1:32:14] listen lots of people pray about lots of
[1:32:17] things they pray to lots of things it
[1:32:20] doesn't mean anything but tonight right
[1:32:22] you can do more than just pray you can
[1:32:26] believe amen you can pray and believe
[1:32:30] Jesus said when you pray believe right
[1:32:33] then you have what you asked for and you
[1:32:36] shall have
[1:32:37] it now if the judge said that then I
[1:32:40] can't overturn that and you can't
[1:32:42] overturn that you can't overturn that in
[1:32:44] your own life or somebody else's amen

[1:32:53] praise him I believe the report that he
[1:32:55] gave on the cross it is
[1:32:57] finished
[1:32:59] amen listen you're going to have that
[1:33:02] confidence that David did when he faced
[1:33:04] G I love how brother R talks about and
[1:33:06] why Christ speak he said you know what
[1:33:07] there's David getting ready to face
[1:33:09] Goliath and and I love how brother Ram
[1:33:10] says it he says he didn't pray through
[1:33:12] he was already prayed through God prayed
[1:33:15] him through before the foundation of the
[1:33:18] world
[1:33:18] Amen he was anointed for the job
[1:33:22] he had to speak the word and go forward
[1:33:25] tonight you're not speaking your idea
[1:33:28] about what God did for you and if you
[1:33:30] are you can throw that
[1:33:32] out amen you're speaking what God said
[1:33:35] about your life when we bring it to pass
[1:33:38] he's already judged it amen it's all
[1:33:41] already settled Thy word oh lord it's
[1:33:47] settled we ought to be settled tonight
[1:33:49] if the word is settled we can be settled
[1:33:52] about his word you believe that tonight
[1:33:54] as you stand to your
[1:33:58] feet you know what the amazing thing
[1:34:00] about that
[1:34:02] is laws change all the time governments
[1:34:06] change all the time look at the laws in
[1:34:08] this country how they've changed in the
[1:34:10] last decade and you think about all the
[1:34:12] nations and the kingdoms that have ever
[1:34:14] been the different types of governments
[1:34:17] we do history with the kids at home it's
[1:34:19] crazy how much the world has changed in
[1:34:21] th000 years but you know what his
[1:34:23] judgment has never had to be altered
[1:34:26] he's never had to set a new precedent
[1:34:28] he's never had to change his
[1:34:30] mind it's not in his nature to do that
[1:34:34] amen if you said you were healed 2,000
[1:34:36] years ago you're still healed tonight if
[1:34:39] you said you were righteous 2,000 years

[1:34:53] bring you out of

[1:34:58] down to the denominational church this
[1:34:59] weekend how many times in our own life
[1:35:01] will we let our own insecurity our own
[1:35:05] expectations our own ideas limit
[1:35:06] somebody else limit ourselves amen
[1:35:09] tonight he's
[1:35:11] greater than your judgment right or the
[1:35:15] the the the chief or the Supreme Court
