[36:41] and amen and just want to uh continue to
[36:46] uh keep those in prayer with everything
[36:50] I know the announcement was read but
[36:53] with everything
[36:54] that is there uh from the hurricane that
[36:58] went through there in the western part
[37:02] um Friday evening uh I went down to
[37:05] support the meetings there Bible
[37:07] Believers for the evening and was just
[37:09] talking with brother Josh Bennett and
[37:11] just um I know I've been getting text
[37:13] from a lot of different Brothers in a
[37:15] lot of the U surrounding areas but it's
[37:18] about 50 about 50 U miles or 50 minutes
[37:21] from him where it took place so
[37:23] everything you know is confined within
[37:25] the Western part and then you see in the
[37:27] eastern part of Tennessee and uh uh I
[37:31] don't know some of you that have uh your
[37:34] Instagram and Facebook and other things
[37:36] like that you uh certainly brother
[37:39] Donnie and them don't put it out like
[37:40] that there's been a lot they've done
[37:42] over the years that no one knows about
[37:44] but their their whole church that that
[37:47] building has become a command center wow
[37:50] not by the government but but you know
[37:53] they've but I'll tell you what there's
[37:55] been a lot of resources that have
[37:56] already
[37:58] um pass through there and
[38:00] so um I just we will make sure we get
[38:04] that out by email if you would like to
[38:06] send and contribute there's many ways
[38:08] that you can uh within that effort and
[38:12] um we just ask that the Lord would just
[38:15] take and just what is given and just
[38:18] Supply it and that's the way no matter
[38:21] what what we can
[38:22] do little as much when God is in
[38:25] it and um there's a lot of testimonies
[38:29] that even has come in and that's really
[38:31] been my prayer and I I think the prayer
[38:33] of many others as well is that God
[38:36] within this situation the lives that
[38:38] were would be touched you know to come
[38:41] to the realization that they they really
[38:43] need the Lord Jesus Christ and uh it's
[38:47] just I know we've seen the videos no
[38:50] doubt some of you have seen the videos
[38:51] and the pictures and things it's just
[38:53] [Music]
[38:55] absolutely I don't know how else to
[38:56] describe it you know some of those
[38:58] places and Roads I've been through there
[39:00] and it's just amazing how some of those
[39:02] places are so where where it's gone and
[39:04] washed away and we have that other
[39:07] hurricane they say that that's
[39:10] forming and I don't know how they name
[39:12] these hurricanes I don't know who names
[39:14] them I don't know if they name them
[39:15] after people they don't like or who how
[39:17] they do this I don't know you know um I
[39:22] remember one one of the years we had a
[39:23] Hur we had two hurricanes that came
[39:25] through that were named after two
[39:26] sisters in our church
[39:27] church and so
[39:31] uh you know so that was quite it was
[39:34] quite something you
[39:36] know we just don't want no hurricanes
[39:38] inside the body
[39:41] here but um we want to just pray because
[39:46] that's going to they're looking for that
[39:47] to come like in the Tampa area and then
[39:50] the same kind of the same pathway and so
[39:52] let's just really let's just really be
[39:55] in prayer God will just turn that amen
[39:58] turn that around how many believe he's
[40:00] more than enough to do
[40:02] thaten we've seen that amen we've seen
[40:05] it not just what we read in the
[40:07] prophet's life we see it in the
[40:09] scriptures but we've witnessed that
[40:11] already happened with with another
[40:13] hurricane amen so let's just keep that
[40:16] in prayer and um there's a few needs
[40:20] that I I want you just to kind of keep
[40:21] before us and maybe the brothers as they
[40:23] lead songs if we just always have this
[40:25] prayer request before us and that is um
[40:28] it's it's always on my heart and that's
[40:30] brother Ron Spencer and then um some of
[40:34] you know brother Keith Buchanan from
[40:36] down in brother Barry's and he's dealing
[40:38] with a a therosis of the liver that has
[40:40] nothing to do with drinking or anything
[40:44] it just is a a condition and he he needs
[40:47] a real intervention from God and it's
[40:50] been it's been quite quite some time
[40:52] that that's going on and and also sister
[40:55] Bethany Lawson those are three that
[40:57] just really and I know there's many
[40:59] other needs I I know that that
[41:00] throughout the body and that's how I
[41:01] always talk to the Lord Lord I know
[41:03] there's many other needs than just be on
[41:06] these three but you know God has people
[41:09] on the other side of the world to pray
[41:11] about those needs over there I don't
[41:13] know how you feel but sometimes I you
[41:15] know things can be mentioned to me and
[41:17] yes I've prayed about it but maybe not
[41:19] with the frequency and I think ah man I
[41:22] man the but you know what we're a
[41:24] body and if and you know how it is if we
[41:27] and every need is important friends I'm
[41:29] not saying that it's not but you know
[41:31] how with everything that we can have up
[41:33] our minds but you know what's so
[41:35] important is that as it's brought to our
[41:37] hearts and just when it comes to your
[41:39] heart you might be in the middle of the
[41:40] grocery store just right at that moment
[41:42] say Lord just remember remember them in
[41:45] prayer Lord maybe you're on the job it
[41:47] comes to you where wherever it comes
[41:48] just just you know just like somebody
[41:50] else that comes to your heart just offer
[41:52] it up in prayer amen you love him amen
[41:56] amen you're not going to count this time
[41:58] against
[42:00] me amen we certainly love you and
[42:02] appreciate you and uh let's just stand
[42:05] if we could and uh we want to go right
[42:08] into the word and I so appreciate the
[42:10] song service appreciate the specials
[42:12] that were sung I think they're on but I
[42:14] think that
[42:19] I'm uh I want to go to Ephesians chapter
[42:23] 3
[42:24] and um want to
[42:28] look here and I I'd like to read the
[42:30] whole chapter but I'm not going to for
[42:32] sake of
[42:33] time um but I would like to start in
[42:37] with verse
[42:38] eight and begin there and Paul is uh
[42:44] expressing uh to the Believers of this
[42:48] mystery and Revelation that God had
[42:52] hidden from before the foundation of the
[42:55] world and remember that mystery
[42:57] was that God would take a people for his
[43:00] name sake remember that the bride
[43:04] herself this is what this is what brings
[43:07] the difference between just churches and
[43:11] the Bride of Jesus Christ that we read
[43:13] about in Revelations 19 and we believe
[43:16] that we are a part of that God has been
[43:18] making up a gentile bride and all of
[43:21] this has been a mystery that was hidden
[43:24] but then after Calvary remember his side
[43:28] was opened at Calvary and out of his
[43:30] side came the water the blood and the
[43:32] spirit is that right and those those
[43:35] three coming together agree in one and
[43:39] then all of that was given in order to
[43:41] bring forth what was taken out of his
[43:44] side then there would be a bride like
[43:46] Adam when Adam was put to sleep a side
[43:50] was open and what was taken out of him
[43:53] was his bride and so that's where the
[43:56] Bride of Jes Jesus Christ is coming from
[43:59] the mind of God always been a part of
[44:01] the word so it's not something that we
[44:02] are we are going to be but it's actually
[44:06] God bringing forth what he's already
[44:09] placed within our
[44:11] lives and so it's God working in our
[44:14] lives to bring this mystery forth in our
[44:17] lives for the Bride of Jesus Christ and
[44:20] she's a she is a lovely lady of the word
[44:23] of God for the bride of Christ there's
[44:26] not one promise in the word that she
[44:28] cannot say Amen to and stand upon every
[44:32] word is true because to deny one word is
[44:35] to deny the headship of the word is that
[44:38] right so here Paul picks this up and
[44:41] he's saying now is the time you know
[44:43] that it has been revealed and I'm so
[44:46] thankful to be living in that time in
[44:48] verse eight unto me who am less than the
[44:51] least of All Saints is this Grace given
[44:54] that I should preach among the Gentiles
[44:57] The unsearchable Riches of Christ now in
[44:59] verse nine and to make all men see what
[45:03] is the Fellowship of the mystery now we
[45:05] know not all will and it isn't that Paul
[45:07] is going to have some great convincing
[45:09] argument but Paul is given by the grace
[45:13] of God the Revelation to speak in that
[45:15] hour and it will be Christ himself that
[45:19] will make himself known to you and I
[45:22] what belongs to you and I it'd be like
[45:25] in the reading of a will if your name's
[45:27] not in there it'll never have any
[45:28] meaning to it but when the will is being
[45:31] read your name is in there and there's a
[45:33] meaning to it and that's where the Holy
[45:35] Spirit comes to open our understanding
[45:37] of what belongs to you and I is that
[45:40] right so that's why even when it comes
[45:43] to every everything that God has for us
[45:46] which from the beginning of the world
[45:47] hath been hid in God who created All
[45:49] Things by Jesus Christ to the intent
[45:52] that now unto the principalities and
[45:55] powers in Heavenly places might be known
[45:58] by the church the manifold wisdom of God
[46:03] according to the Eternal purpose which
[46:05] he purposed in Christ Jesus our lord in
[46:10] whom we have boldness and access with
[46:16] confidence by the faith of him so this
[46:18] is not our faith now this is his faith
[46:22] operating through our lives amen Paul
[46:26] says wherefore I desire that you faint
[46:28] not at my tribulations for you which is
[46:31] your glory for this cause I bow my knees
[46:34] unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[46:36] of whom the whole family in Heaven and
[46:38] Earth is named that he would Grant you
[46:41] according to the riches of his glory to
[46:43] be strengthened with might by his spirit
[46:47] in the inner man that Christ here's the
[46:50] purpose that Christ May dwell in your
[46:52] hearts by faith that ye being rooted and
[46:57] grounded in love may be able to
[47:00] comprehend with All Saints what is the
[47:02] breadth and length and depth and height
[47:06] and to know the love of Christ which
[47:08] passeth on passeth knowledge that you
[47:11] might be filled with all the fullness of
[47:14] God now unto him that is able to do
[47:17] exceeding abundantly above all that we
[47:20] could ask or think he he's beyond what
[47:22] we could ask or
[47:24] think yes sir he's working in our life
[47:27] and Beyond there's nothing that's too
[47:29] big that he is not exalted above that
[47:32] Hallelujah no matter what situation no
[47:34] matter what need no matter what
[47:36] besetting sin there's nothing that is
[47:39] too great that the name of Jesus Christ
[47:42] could not be placed above
[47:45] it now unto him that is able to to do
[47:48] exceedingly above all that we ask or
[47:51] think according to the power that
[47:53] worketh in US unto him be glory in the
[47:56] Church by Christ Jesus throughout all
[47:59] ages World Without End Amen let's just
[48:03] bow our heads in a word of prayer
[48:05] Heavenly
[48:06] Father how we thank you for your mercies
[48:09] Lord here this morning we thank you dear
[48:11] God for the grace of God that's been
[48:13] extended to us Lord in this hour and
[48:16] father that our eyes Lord would be
[48:18] anointed to see to see clearly to see
[48:21] you father and oh God to see ourselves
[48:24] Lord in you in the vision in the word
[48:27] Lord father we're asking tonight May
[48:30] Lord the same Holy Spirit Lord that God
[48:33] has moved with inspiration Lord upon
[48:36] those who wrote those scriptures Lord
[48:39] may you come Lord I pray and Lord just
[48:41] open this word to our hearts Lord speak
[48:45] to every need Lord we completely Reserve
[48:48] Lord ourselves to you that in everything
[48:50] you might receive Glory and Honor Lord
[48:53] we commit this service Lord into your
[48:55] hands now in the name name of Jesus
[48:57] Christ amen amen God bless you as you're
[49:00] being
[49:02] seated
[49:03] amen I want to I'd like to speak here um
[49:08] this morning if you can go ahead and
[49:09] switch it over for me please I'd like to
[49:11] go ahead and speak here this morning on
[49:14] on this thought just three words out of
[49:16] out of the verse that we had read
[49:19] boldness access and
[49:22] confidence and uh this is certainly
[49:25] God's this is God's 's desire and this
[49:28] is something that no one no one can can
[49:32] produce this of boldness this access we
[49:36] have this confidence outside of Christ
[49:39] himself so this is not a facade this is
[49:42] not something that has come from a pep
[49:45] rally or a work up but this is something
[49:47] that comes from a settl that has come
[49:50] within the heart of the believer that we
[49:53] know where we're standing with God and
[49:54] this is where in the scriptures that we
[49:57] read it's very very clear according to
[49:59] the Eternal purpose which he purposed in
[50:03] Christ Jesus our lord now notice how he
[50:06] wrote this he purposed this in Christ
[50:09] Jesus the anointed word our Lord and
[50:14] this purpose was not something that has
[50:16] just been developed you know it's not
[50:18] like you or I Who start uh upon a
[50:21] project and then you make modifications
[50:23] to it and think H I think this is a
[50:25] little bit better over here uh this trim
[50:27] would look better over here uh this
[50:29] paint collar that's not how God operates
[50:32] God already in his mind before there was
[50:36] atom or molecule God is the is eternal
[50:41] and so he had everything laid out from
[50:44] the beginning to the end God had
[50:47] everything laid out and all everything
[50:50] in our our finite Minds it's so hard for
[50:53] us in our minds to grasp that because uh
[50:57] our minds are not meant to be able to
[50:59] grasp the infinite God because we work
[51:02] in a level of the of the finiteness of
[51:04] if I could say that of where as I said
[51:06] before we make changes and alterations
[51:09] and oh that was bad and this is good but
[51:12] God has never had a new
[51:15] thought God's never had to use an eraser
[51:19] to erase something that he ever thought
[51:21] because remember before it could ever be
[51:23] a word it was a thought amen is that
[51:26] right we were in God's thoughts before
[51:29] the foundation of the world Paul writes
[51:31] of that even through Ephesians you see
[51:34] this is the real thing that brings
[51:36] stability in the life of the believer is
[51:39] when that vision of the word can break
[51:41] Upon Our Lives to recognize I'm not a
[51:44] beggar I'm not a foreigner I'm not a
[51:46] stranger as a matter of fact what it is
[51:48] that is a desire in my life I'm seeing
[51:50] it set before me and I have a right to
[51:54] the promises of God that's what the
[51:57] gospel comes to make us aware of and to
[52:02] administer those rights to you and
[52:05] I notice verse 12 in whom this is where
[52:09] very important in him we have boldness
[52:13] and access with confidence by the faith
[52:18] of him so when we look at this this
[52:22] boldness it's a boldness it's a freedom
[52:24] in speaking now listen I'm not talking
[52:27] about somebody and and I'm I'm saying
[52:29] these things to be funny because you
[52:30] know we all know people who who who who
[52:33] need to actually think more before they
[52:36] speak right the Bible gave you know God
[52:39] gave us he didn't give us two mouths and
[52:41] one ear he gave us two ears in one mouth
[52:44] and you know the thing that when we're
[52:46] talking about this freedom in speaking
[52:48] we're not talking about just being a
[52:50] loose cannon we're not talking about
[52:53] somebody that's just you know open mouth
[52:55] insert foot we're not talking about that
[52:58] we're talking about a freedom in that
[53:01] that there is nothing hindering me from
[53:04] declaring what the word says that I am
[53:08] there's nothing hindering me from
[53:11] looking to the promise of God and say
[53:13] healing belongs to me Deliverance
[53:16] belongs to me my children belong to me
[53:20] God has said this in his word it's a
[53:22] freedom in speaking in other words I'm
[53:25] not tied nobody has any ties on me right
[53:29] are you hearing
[53:30] me it's kind of like you know a
[53:32] politician that has no Lobby groups tied
[53:34] to it it's dangerous it's scary because
[53:37] he owes nobody nothing but you see when
[53:39] a man when a man listen to me when a man
[53:42] or woman can be so separated to God to
[53:45] the devil has no tie upon your
[53:48] life then comes a boldness of freedom in
[53:53] speaking an openness of frankness in
[53:56] speech uh a a free and fearless
[54:00] confidence cheerful courage boldness and
[54:03] Assurance in other words I'm not worried
[54:05] about backsliding I'm not I'm not
[54:07] focused upon that that fear has been
[54:10] driven out of my life you say how does
[54:13] that happen because when God takes a
[54:16] hold of your life and the holy spirit
[54:18] moves in your life God continues to
[54:21] build confidence after confidence in
[54:23] your life to where he God is letting you
[54:26] know that it's not you that's doing it
[54:29] it is me that is doing it I'm the one
[54:32] that's doing it he drives out any lack
[54:35] of
[54:37] confidence oh there's nothing as
[54:39] powerful as the word to bring a real
[54:41] boldness in our lives and that access
[54:44] that we have we have an approach to God
[54:46] a relationship with God we're not
[54:49] Beggars we're not strangers and we did
[54:51] not become sons of God on a certain day
[54:55] we always were Sons and Daughters of God
[54:58] the prodal son was always a Son of God
[55:02] he got away from the father's house but
[55:05] he was always a Son of God he had to
[55:08] come to himself and recognize where he
[55:10] was at and when he was in the midst of
[55:12] the pig pin his thoughts were changed
[55:15] his heart was being changed toward home
[55:17] oh my what he once tried to run from and
[55:20] get away from but let me tell you if you
[55:23] belong to God you can run run run but
[55:26] you'll never outrun the
[55:29] predestination of almighty God God's
[55:32] word will find you and bring you back
[55:35] and let me tell you there's a power that
[55:37] works beyond your own will because by
[55:40] your own will you could never do it but
[55:42] there comes a power that moves Upon Our
[55:45] will let me just say it like this a
[55:47] power to overthrow your own
[55:50] [Applause]
[55:53] will Lord so we have received
[55:57] an unreserved
[55:59] freedom and a
[56:01] change if I can say it this way of
[56:03] relationship
[56:05] status that has brought a complete trust
[56:08] in him that's what confidence is we've
[56:10] got a trust in him do you know how this
[56:12] is going I don't know how it's going to
[56:14] turn out but I trust
[56:16] him I don't need to know all the p's and
[56:19] q's I just need to know him when God
[56:22] came to Mary she said how shall this be
[56:25] and God said let me take those words of
[56:28] how or those letters and let me just
[56:30] give you the answer the answer is not
[56:32] how but the answer is who wh he took the
[56:37] same words of how the letters and he let
[56:39] her know it's not how it's the who he is
[56:43] the one who performs the
[56:46] promise I want you to look at this in
[56:48] the scriptures here of this boldness
[56:50] being exhibited here is Peter and them
[56:52] after the man was healed at the gate
[56:55] called Beautiful remember it was not
[56:57] Peter and and John that healed him they
[57:00] were instruments right right now
[57:03] remember this is the incident right here
[57:06] in Acts 4:13 where the Prophet tells us
[57:09] that got the devil stirred up and mad he
[57:13] told us that when the Holy Ghost fell
[57:15] this is what the prophet's words were he
[57:17] when the Holy Ghost fell on the day of
[57:19] Pentecost Satan didn't even get out of
[57:21] his own
[57:22] bed but he said when the gate called
[57:25] Beautiful happened and took place he
[57:27] said Satan got out of his bed he said
[57:29] because the phenomena the supernatural
[57:32] was moving through surrendered vessels
[57:35] in life let me tell you the devil don't
[57:37] care how much that we could set and sit
[57:40] around and and what I have but you
[57:42] remember what God has given you remember
[57:45] the Holy Ghost is come to put you into
[57:49] Service as a son and daughter of God
[57:52] sanctification makes you ready for
[57:54] service but it is the holy ghost that
[57:57] put you into service to be a witness
[57:59] where God has called you to be a
[58:02] witness the Bible says when they saw the
[58:04] boldness of Peter and John and perceived
[58:07] that they were unlearned and ignorant
[58:08] men these guys the prophet said they
[58:10] couldn't even read their name on the
[58:11] side of a box
[58:13] car God don't need intellects that's
[58:17] right he don't need
[58:20] intellects God does it in such a way
[58:23] that it has to take knowledge that
[58:26] within this it's got to be something
[58:28] more than the intellects of man they
[58:30] marveled they took knowledge of him that
[58:32] they had been with Jesus that's the kind
[58:34] of testimony I want I don't want the
[58:37] testimony of oh uh he just been the bwt
[58:40] the Devil comes to BS
[58:42] WT you say how can you say that Hey
[58:45] listen you think Satan is excluded from
[58:47] the Gathering of Sons and Daughters of
[58:49] God when when the sons of God gathered
[58:51] there Job chapter 1 when the sons of God
[58:54] gathered Satan gathered up there too now
[58:57] don't go getting anybody in your mind
[58:59] I'm talking about the devil if your
[59:01] brother or sister Did You Wrong your
[59:03] brother sisters not the
[59:06] devil come on friends no more their
[59:08] wrong no more your attitude it's the
[59:10] devil that would like to get
[59:13] between woo they saw the boldness of
[59:17] Peter and John that's that where they
[59:20] noticed these men were speaking without
[59:22] any holds upon their life and going on
[59:25] and acts 4:29 when they had released
[59:28] them the Bible says when they went into
[59:31] prayer Lord behold their threatenings
[59:34] and Grant unto thy servants that with
[59:37] all boldness they may speak Thy word you
[59:40] see we could take lesson right here
[59:42] instead of getting on Facebook and
[59:44] Instagram and calling every one of our
[59:46] buddies and our friends and complaining
[59:48] about all of our problems and our
[59:50] situations and looking for somebody to
[59:52] be our helper somebody to lift me up let
[59:55] me tell you you have an open Mainline
[59:58] there is a connection to the throne of
[1:00:01] almighty God it is not closed off listen
[1:00:04] friends I'm not against calling somebody
[1:00:06] else but listen you got to make sure
[1:00:08] that you've got to walk with God that
[1:00:10] you've got to hold on God and God's got
[1:00:12] to hold on your life cuz nobody can
[1:00:15] replace the indwelling of the Holy Ghost
[1:00:18] in your life he said he wants to be your
[1:00:20] guide and your leader in your life
[1:00:24] H amen amen woo my a lot of fresh things
[1:00:29] Dro in
[1:00:30] here but that they may speak Thy Word
[1:00:33] with boldness by stretching forth hand
[1:00:35] to heal and that signs and wonders may
[1:00:37] be done by the name of thy holy Child
[1:00:40] Jesus and when they had prayed the place
[1:00:43] was shaken where they were assembled
[1:00:45] together and they were all filled with
[1:00:48] the Holy Ghost and they spake the word
[1:00:50] of God with
[1:00:51] boldness you see that pattern they had
[1:00:54] just been filled with the Holy Ghost few
[1:00:56] days before that right so many times we
[1:00:59] live below our
[1:01:00] privileges we allow Our Lives to be
[1:01:02] filled with so many other
[1:01:05] things and then this is where our stand
[1:01:09] gets
[1:01:11] weak I'm preaching now right but you see
[1:01:14] when situations arise persecution was
[1:01:17] coming upon the church trials was coming
[1:01:20] upon the church that's not the time to
[1:01:22] pull away from God that's the time to
[1:01:24] say Lord Grant Lord the grace that I
[1:01:27] need Grant a refilling of the spirit of
[1:01:30] God that I might be able to stand and
[1:01:33] speak the word with boldness you know
[1:01:35] what youve got to do you've got to stand
[1:01:37] on your ground and say I'm not going to
[1:01:39] release any of this Crown no matter what
[1:01:43] test no matter what trial comes Satan is
[1:01:46] not getting one eye OD of ground that's
[1:01:49] standing there with a boldness listen
[1:01:52] friends it takes more than just
[1:01:53] something of us saying it it comes their
[1:01:56] strength for standing in boldness came
[1:01:59] with the refilling of the Holy
[1:02:04] Ghost watch
[1:02:06] Paul and for me this is what part of the
[1:02:09] prayer this is part of praying and he
[1:02:11] says and for me this is the praying that
[1:02:13] utterance may be given unto me that I
[1:02:15] may open my mouth boldly now remember
[1:02:18] we're not talking about that
[1:02:20] naturally some of us have problems with
[1:02:22] this naturally this is talking about
[1:02:24] spiritually oh we're very quick oh don't
[1:02:27] cross my path you need to let the Holy
[1:02:29] Ghost take a hold of your life if your
[1:02:32] buttons are that fragile you need to
[1:02:34] make sure you've got the main spring on
[1:02:36] the inside and yield to him you don't
[1:02:38] want to be known as a stick of dynamite
[1:02:41] that's ready to explode at any time
[1:02:42] Handle With Care come on friends oh
[1:02:46] that's just my makeup I thought we're
[1:02:47] Sons and Daughters of God are we going
[1:02:50] to claim that we're Sons and Daughters
[1:02:51] of God and then when the word's being P
[1:02:53] preached pulled back on it no we're
[1:02:55] going to stand with a real boldness and
[1:02:58] say Lord that's the mark that I'm to hit
[1:03:00] give me the grace that I need in my life
[1:03:02] that my life would match what the word
[1:03:04] is calling
[1:03:06] for oh my remember when the Lamb's wife
[1:03:09] was revealed it did not say it did not
[1:03:11] say the Lion's wife it said the Lamb's
[1:03:14] wife why submissive nature and through
[1:03:17] that submission it receives Divine
[1:03:19] authority of the lion operating through
[1:03:21] the lamb am notice this he says to make
[1:03:25] known The Mystery of the Gospel this is
[1:03:27] the purpose God I want this boldness for
[1:03:30] which I am an ambassador in bonds that
[1:03:34] therein I may speak boldly as I ought to
[1:03:37] speak I don't know about you but this is
[1:03:40] something to me when I read this this is
[1:03:42] the same thing as in Acts chapter 4 that
[1:03:45] there this is why the refreshing from
[1:03:47] the presence of God the renewing the
[1:03:49] washing of Water by the word this is why
[1:03:51] we need refilling of the Holy Spirit
[1:03:54] listen friends when we find yourself
[1:03:56] getting a little LAX when you find
[1:03:58] yourself giving away when you find
[1:04:00] listen to me now this is where it
[1:04:02] requires us to be very honest when you
[1:04:04] find yourself reasoning against the word
[1:04:08] of God or even allowing a voice to
[1:04:12] reason against it of what belongs to you
[1:04:15] this is where you need to come back to
[1:04:18] and say God granted Lord a fresh
[1:04:21] refilling that I might stand there with
[1:04:23] a boldness in other words I'm going to
[1:04:26] ask you the question are you living in
[1:04:28] the same Victory as when God got a hold
[1:04:31] of your life or has your boundaries been
[1:04:35] compromised come on friends we got to
[1:04:38] understand that if the boundaries
[1:04:39] themselves have been compromised it
[1:04:41] isn't God's fault it isn't that the
[1:04:43] devil is some big bad guy it's we let
[1:04:47] down and asking God Lord give me the
[1:04:50] boldness I need give me the strength I
[1:04:52] need to speak as I ought to speak
[1:04:57] right there's times before where you
[1:04:59] would have never compromised on being in
[1:05:01] the house of
[1:05:03] God there's times before the boss could
[1:05:06] have said we're going to do this and
[1:05:07] we're going to do that you never would
[1:05:08] have done that before now listen you can
[1:05:10] talk to me about the economy all you
[1:05:11] want to talk to me about the economy and
[1:05:13] if that's making you mad we'll stomp on
[1:05:15] your toes a little
[1:05:16] more you see friends look at it just
[1:05:19] look at it Satan is always there to hand
[1:05:21] out excuses we can then we can find
[1:05:23] dozens of excuses as to why we can't do
[1:05:26] this or we can't do that but the Bible
[1:05:28] says that my God shall supply all that I
[1:05:31] have need
[1:05:33] of are you with me now yes oh if I was
[1:05:36] so and so if I was so and so no God's
[1:05:38] called you and I to be who he's called
[1:05:40] us to be but this is where I'm trying to
[1:05:43] show you this is an access that we have
[1:05:45] to be able to stand here with a boldness
[1:05:48] by his
[1:05:51] Spirit Philippians
[1:05:54] 1 verse 19
[1:05:56] 20 Paul said for I know that this
[1:06:00] talking about this bondage he was in
[1:06:03] shall turn to my salvation through your
[1:06:05] prayer and the supply of the spirit of
[1:06:07] Jesus Christ according to my Earnest
[1:06:09] expectation and my hope that in nothing
[1:06:13] I shall be ashamed but with that with
[1:06:16] all boldness as always so now also
[1:06:19] Christ shall be magnified in my body
[1:06:23] whether it be by life or by
[1:06:26] death right now I want you to think of
[1:06:28] it these scriptures that I read to you
[1:06:31] right here it's started out remember
[1:06:33] when you look here there the scriptures
[1:06:35] all the way what what Isaiah saw Ezekiel
[1:06:38] Saw the same thing John saw the same
[1:06:40] thing in Revelations 4 he saw the four
[1:06:43] living creatures now what it comes down
[1:06:45] to these are characteristics of the
[1:06:48] spirit of God that would be that would
[1:06:50] be exhibited or shown through the seven
[1:06:53] Church ages that of the lion is started
[1:06:56] out there with those first three ages
[1:06:58] then it came the time of the ox now the
[1:07:01] lion started out with the courage but
[1:07:03] you know what the gospel never left a
[1:07:05] courage in other words it never became
[1:07:08] as though the gospel moved back and was
[1:07:10] no longer courageous no the spirit of
[1:07:12] God now moves in a place of a ox where
[1:07:16] it is the surrendering of Life on
[1:07:18] account of the word where they remember
[1:07:20] they called them up there in those times
[1:07:22] when when har the Roman Catholic church
[1:07:24] and all them they laid all of those
[1:07:26] great Martyrs down through time and
[1:07:28] remember they they called him up there
[1:07:30] and there were those who would stand
[1:07:31] there not just older not just middleaged
[1:07:33] even the young people that would stand
[1:07:35] there and told them recount take away if
[1:07:38] you recount we'll save you from this
[1:07:40] fire we'll save you from these Lions but
[1:07:43] you see they were under the anointing of
[1:07:45] the Holy Spirit as an ox to surrender
[1:07:49] their
[1:07:51] lives Hallelujah then we come here comes
[1:07:55] down to Luther Luther the sardian age
[1:07:58] then the Philadelphian age then the lady
[1:08:00] oan age under the man anointing the
[1:08:02] restoration of gifts ausa Street
[1:08:03] Pentecost was under the man
[1:08:06] anointing is that right it was under the
[1:08:08] man anointing God used the man Luther
[1:08:11] took the scriptures and then they had
[1:08:13] these N9 that's where he came up with
[1:08:15] the 99 thesis under inspiration of God
[1:08:18] where they were wanting to say that this
[1:08:19] is the literal body of Jesus Christ and
[1:08:22] this is the literal blood and Luther
[1:08:24] blew Luther threw it down and say that's
[1:08:26] nonsense that is not the truth that is
[1:08:29] error you know what it was the wisdom of
[1:08:31] man it was the spirit of God operating
[1:08:35] through the wisdom of
[1:08:37] man it was a time of reformation of
[1:08:40] reforming this is why we're living in
[1:08:42] the hour of the Flying Eagle amen are
[1:08:46] you hearing me we're living under the
[1:08:48] anointed this is the anointing of the
[1:08:51] spirit of God in this hour and that
[1:08:53] anointing of the Flying Eagle it lifts
[1:08:55] us from looking at things in an Earthly
[1:08:58] view if you're looking at things in an
[1:08:59] Earthly view you need to say God let my
[1:09:02] eyes be anointed let me be caught up
[1:09:05] Lord because when the eagle anointing is
[1:09:07] over your life then that's by the word
[1:09:10] when you see that you can see then the
[1:09:12] end you see your destiny you see things
[1:09:15] more
[1:09:16] clearly is everybody with me it's like
[1:09:19] that that little picture that we sent
[1:09:21] you out there where all of that was
[1:09:23] created for you to know how to come in
[1:09:24] here and the parking spaces that was not
[1:09:26] taken that picture was not taken from
[1:09:29] ground
[1:09:30] level that picture was taken from
[1:09:32] something above looking down you see
[1:09:35] this is why prayer is so important
[1:09:37] because you can look on eye level and
[1:09:38] you can accuse your brother or
[1:09:41] sister come on Friends the prophet said
[1:09:44] he said we can backslide he said on one
[1:09:46] another in the church he said we can
[1:09:48] backslide on Christ but we can't
[1:09:50] backslide on God because the blood of
[1:09:52] Jesus Christ stands between us and
[1:09:55] almighty God so others around can see
[1:09:58] that but this is why this is why the
[1:10:00] prophet said when you get caught up in
[1:10:02] prayer and you get there then you will
[1:10:05] begin to put yourself in the other
[1:10:07] person's shoes and giving them if I can
[1:10:09] say like we did on Thursday night a
[1:10:12] pass that's good and I'm not talking
[1:10:14] about a pass that's held over their head
[1:10:17] cuz that ain't forgiveness right that's
[1:10:20] fakeness right amen woo preach brother
[1:10:23] Samuel Hallelujah
[1:10:26] amen well I got plenty of scripture but
[1:10:28] I'm not going to go in all that but
[1:10:30] that's the word of God you know we want
[1:10:33] genuine forgiveness now notice this here
[1:10:36] on these four living creatures that's
[1:10:37] why the prophet said in this age he said
[1:10:40] they were under the inspiration of the
[1:10:42] spirit of God and the power of God how
[1:10:44] could a man do anything else beside the
[1:10:47] power of God that had been released to
[1:10:49] them he said that's the only thing when
[1:10:51] that Spirit certain Spirit was among
[1:10:53] them that's the only thing that they can
[1:10:56] work by is the spirit that's among them
[1:10:59] and the church will always respond to
[1:11:02] the anointing they can't do nothing else
[1:11:04] hallelujah hallelujah so so in other
[1:11:07] words when the spirit of God the word of
[1:11:10] God comes in this hour he promised when
[1:11:12] the enemy would come in like a flood
[1:11:14] that the spirit of God would raise a
[1:11:16] standard up against him the only way to
[1:11:19] meet the enemy in this hour it will
[1:11:21] never work under a man anointing that's
[1:11:23] right come on now it don't never work
[1:11:25] just on the the the the reintroduction
[1:11:28] of the nine spiritual gifts it will not
[1:11:31] defeat the
[1:11:32] enemy it's got to come under the Flying
[1:11:34] Eagle which is a prophetic word a word
[1:11:38] that puts all those things in position a
[1:11:40] word that lets you know where you come
[1:11:42] from you are in God's mind a word that
[1:11:45] brings stability in your life a word
[1:11:47] that lets you look beyond your situation
[1:11:50] and know I'm an overcomer I am I I am
[1:11:53] one of his I am redeemed and you're able
[1:11:56] to stand there as a son and daughter of
[1:11:59] God
[1:12:01] hallelujah every man that's ever met God
[1:12:05] every man that's ever met God upon these
[1:12:08] sacred Sands of God's grace there's an
[1:12:11] anointing that comes to anoint the faith
[1:12:14] that God has placed in him the prophet
[1:12:16] said it like this and why Christ speak
[1:12:18] Moses was born with these great
[1:12:21] qualities he had these great qualities
[1:12:24] of faith in in him he says again he says
[1:12:27] he was born with this equipment in
[1:12:31] him but when he comes into the presence
[1:12:34] of God that's when that Faith becomes
[1:12:38] anointed because before that time when
[1:12:40] opposition came Moses
[1:12:44] ran but when now by the presence of God
[1:12:47] it becomes not Moses Faith but it
[1:12:51] becomes God's faith operating through
[1:12:54] Moses life amen he's got an anchor he's
[1:12:57] got a stand that he is able to move by
[1:13:00] the Holy Spirit and is moved by by God
[1:13:02] look at Noah Noah is the same
[1:13:05] way when they came to Noah like we
[1:13:08] looked at last week and they remember
[1:13:09] the prophet tells us they they shot the
[1:13:11] instruments up there and said there
[1:13:12] ain't no moisture in the air there they
[1:13:14] didn't listen in the dictionary rain
[1:13:16] wasn't even a
[1:13:19] word that was not how the one that's not
[1:13:22] how the Earth was cared for as a matter
[1:13:23] of fact the Earth wasn't even tilled it
[1:13:26] it was atomic explosion that knocked it
[1:13:29] over right this is why when it when it
[1:13:32] comes back here under the Sons and
[1:13:34] Daughters of God it'll come back to its
[1:13:36] upright
[1:13:37] position you know why cuz the Earth is a
[1:13:39] redeemable attribute of God that's the
[1:13:41] same thing the Holy Spirit does to you
[1:13:43] and I it brings us back to our upright
[1:13:45] position in
[1:13:48] Christ is that right so notice it's the
[1:13:51] same way with Noah same way with Moses
[1:13:53] same way with David they trusted in the
[1:13:56] anointing that was upon their life I
[1:13:59] hope you understand what I'm saying they
[1:14:01] were not falsely anointed no balum was
[1:14:05] anointed that's right but he was a false
[1:14:08] prophet right he had the genu and
[1:14:11] anointing of the Holy Spirit but he did
[1:14:14] not have a heart that was lined in
[1:14:16] obedience to God balam did not have that
[1:14:20] what was needed on the inside to be able
[1:14:23] to become illuminated
[1:14:25] by the anointing of God and God was
[1:14:27] letting you and I see that even though
[1:14:30] gifts can come a dime a dozen Hey listen
[1:14:33] there's many many in hell that's right
[1:14:37] that they lended their gift to the
[1:14:42] devil Beatles on and on Michael Jackson
[1:14:46] we could go on and on Elvis presely one
[1:14:49] night singing gospel another night
[1:14:51] singing
[1:14:52] this you know why they do that you know
[1:14:55] why they've done that I've I've watched
[1:14:56] some documentaries you know why they're
[1:14:57] doing that because of the tormenting
[1:15:00] spirits and they're trying to appease
[1:15:03] that tormenting Spirit upon their life
[1:15:05] let me tell you right now this morning
[1:15:07] if you're here with a tormenting Spirit
[1:15:09] there is a place where that tormenting
[1:15:12] Spirit can be lifted off of your life
[1:15:15] and you can walk with the real freedom
[1:15:18] in your life and in your heart where
[1:15:19] you're not tormented with the Fashions
[1:15:21] of this world I've got to be in step
[1:15:23] with this world that's a Spirit and the
[1:15:26] Holy Ghost comes to break and loosen
[1:15:28] those
[1:15:30] Spirits oh my there ought have been a
[1:15:32] bigger Amen on that one it comes to
[1:15:35] loosen those
[1:15:37] holes amen they were able notice every
[1:15:40] one of them were able to stand in the
[1:15:42] face of adversity I'm talking about this
[1:15:44] boldness
[1:15:45] now David was able to stand there when
[1:15:47] his brothers had this so-called
[1:15:49] discernment of what they discerned was
[1:15:51] in his
[1:15:52] heart is that right he was able to stand
[1:15:55] there in the face of adversity gon bear
[1:15:58] Goliath he was able to stand there they
[1:16:01] were able to subdue
[1:16:03] kingdoms and because they were in their
[1:16:06] innermost they were surrendered to God
[1:16:10] right that's the real key right
[1:16:13] there I want you to notice this this is
[1:16:15] where we want it to come we want to be
[1:16:18] we want to stand with conviction that's
[1:16:21] what boldness is we're living in an age
[1:16:24] friends
[1:16:26] where nobody well I don't want to say
[1:16:28] nobody but for the majority don't have
[1:16:31] conviction look how much trash and
[1:16:33] immorality has entered in pull
[1:16:35] pits now let me just tell you that
[1:16:37] didn't come in just within the last year
[1:16:40] the reason that nonsense is in there is
[1:16:43] because the Holy Ghost was put out of
[1:16:45] those churches they got rid of the word
[1:16:48] of God and when you get rid of the word
[1:16:50] of God something's got to fill that
[1:16:53] place and I'll tell you what's filled
[1:16:55] that place I don't care how anointed
[1:16:56] they are it is Devils that has filled
[1:16:59] that place fallen angels that kept not
[1:17:02] their first estate I'm going to preach
[1:17:04] now it's the same way with trying to
[1:17:06] tamper with this message as though I'm
[1:17:09] going to figure this out and brother
[1:17:11] Brandon said this here brother Brandon
[1:17:12] said that here Anointed with a fallen
[1:17:16] angel because there are angels that kept
[1:17:18] their first estate and that first estate
[1:17:22] is staying with the word of God I'll
[1:17:24] tell you right now now I don't got time
[1:17:25] for nobody I don't have time for nobody
[1:17:28] that wants to try to Tamper around this
[1:17:29] message when you tell me it's brother
[1:17:31] Ram's opinion you have told me that I
[1:17:33] don't need to hear you no
[1:17:35] more flat plain
[1:17:40] simple good brother Samuel that offends
[1:17:42] me well you need to ask God to put some
[1:17:44] good Sav On it right there cuz that's
[1:17:46] where I
[1:17:48] stand I'm interested in a Rapture
[1:17:50] friends I'm not interested in church
[1:17:53] members I'm not interested in been
[1:17:55] patting you on the back Hallelujah come
[1:17:57] on now I'm not interested in my welfare
[1:18:00] I'm interested when I stand there on
[1:18:02] that day that there is no excuse that
[1:18:04] you have and say if you would only
[1:18:06] preached it a little harder if You' only
[1:18:08] been true to me if you'd only been
[1:18:10] honest with
[1:18:12] me It Might Sting now but it'll do us
[1:18:15] good if we'll let the word Lord let it
[1:18:17] sink into my heart
[1:18:25] I'm planning on standing there with you
[1:18:27] on that day we might have to walk
[1:18:29] through many fires we might have to come
[1:18:31] through many storms many times of
[1:18:33] praying for one another for God's grace
[1:18:36] but by the grace of almighty God this
[1:18:39] word that we have been given I have a
[1:18:42] boldness to say where it has swept the
[1:18:44] world out of my life taken me from the
[1:18:47] world it will sweep us all the way to
[1:18:53] glory amen praise the Lord get some
[1:18:56] conviction about your
[1:19:02] life quit letting quit letting the enemy
[1:19:05] buff you Buffalo you
[1:19:08] around come on friends I listen what I'm
[1:19:11] trying to tell you this is not mind over
[1:19:12] matter I'm trying to talk to you where
[1:19:15] this boldness comes from this is where
[1:19:18] we've got to be honest with God in
[1:19:19] evaluation of our own life to stand with
[1:19:22] the conviction this is why this is a
[1:19:24] picture of poly car but notice what Paul
[1:19:26] said like this watch ye Stand Fast in
[1:19:29] the faith quit you like men and be
[1:19:32] strong that's a big word cuz we're
[1:19:34] living in a society of
[1:19:37] sissies I'm talking not only gays but
[1:19:39] I'm talking about straight as
[1:19:41] well where they let the wife just you
[1:19:43] know lead them around and everything I'm
[1:19:45] not talking about a man being a
[1:19:47] dictator Christ is no dictator but his
[1:19:50] church don't tell him what to
[1:19:52] do because the church that tells him to
[1:19:54] do is not his
[1:19:57] bride it's an
[1:19:59] impostor come on that's what the Bible
[1:20:01] says in the Book of Revelation it said
[1:20:04] as I said as a queen I have need of
[1:20:06] nothing but God will judge her because
[1:20:08] she claims to be married to the word and
[1:20:11] she transgresses against the word amen
[1:20:15] hallelujah giving out this and this p
[1:20:18] and that that's not the kind of pastors
[1:20:19] we want we want the pass of the blood in
[1:20:21] our
[1:20:22] life we want to know that we met God and
[1:20:25] we have met the requirements through our
[1:20:28] Passover Christ Jesus Hallelujah quit
[1:20:31] you like men in other words be brave
[1:20:33] that's what this means stand with some
[1:20:35] conviction that don't mean you've got to
[1:20:37] be a
[1:20:38] bully but stand with some conviction it
[1:20:42] doesn't mean you've got you don't mean
[1:20:43] you've got to have a a big bous voice
[1:20:46] but have some conviction let me put it
[1:20:49] like this have a
[1:20:52] backbone come on friends I know I know
[1:20:55] that having a a real man that's a that's
[1:20:57] a rare thing in this hour y but I'll
[1:21:00] tell you what let me just say you this
[1:21:01] right now I'll just let me just speak to
[1:21:03] all the sisters a minute I have watched
[1:21:05] over at different times where times
[1:21:07] where I've had individuals come to me
[1:21:10] and when want to complain to me about
[1:21:12] their
[1:21:13] husbands sometimes it's not even sitting
[1:21:15] right here and I'm looking at it I'm
[1:21:17] thinking but you don't even come to the
[1:21:19] house of God
[1:21:22] faithfully and your husband is trying to
[1:21:24] make an effort to come to the house of
[1:21:26] God I'm going to preach now amen
[1:21:29] hallelujah my question is what are you
[1:21:31] doing yes you see everybody wants Jesus
[1:21:35] to fix everything and let us live the
[1:21:37] way we want to live you know there's a
[1:21:39] scripture for that the Bible said in
[1:21:40] Isaiah seven women shall take hold of
[1:21:43] one man but they let him know we will
[1:21:46] eat our own bread and we're going to
[1:21:48] wear the kind of clothes we want to wear
[1:21:50] but just let us be called by your
[1:21:52] name that's a prophecy of this
[1:21:55] you see you can't have the benefits of
[1:21:58] the life of the word if you don't come
[1:22:00] under the
[1:22:01] [Applause]
[1:22:04] word it amazes me you know with things
[1:22:07] the way that people want problems and
[1:22:09] they want oh the pastor as though the
[1:22:11] pastor when he's you know uh comes in
[1:22:13] his office and these magic wands and and
[1:22:15] this and that and everything else but
[1:22:17] you know what God isn't trusted you and
[1:22:19] I and you know what it is the greatest
[1:22:21] power and strength that we have is to
[1:22:23] surrender our own life with God I look
[1:22:25] at it like this with my boys and their
[1:22:27] stand for God that's God's grace in
[1:22:29] their life I'm thankful I'm thankful for
[1:22:31] these other young people I tell you as
[1:22:34] parents right here we ought to Rally
[1:22:36] right around that oh brother Samuel I'm
[1:22:38] going to send them everywhere I'm not
[1:22:39] talking about sending them everywhere
[1:22:41] I'm talking about in your life be a
[1:22:44] testimony be an example of the love of
[1:22:47] God right here right
[1:22:49] now it's don't put it off on somebody
[1:22:52] else or if we was only here if we was
[1:22:54] only with fa God is no respector
[1:22:58] persons is that right it's like I told
[1:23:01] the young people in one of the meeting
[1:23:02] did God make a mistake does God make
[1:23:05] mistakes they said NOP I said so did God
[1:23:07] make a mistake when he put you
[1:23:09] here
[1:23:12] right oh my God Don't Make
[1:23:16] Mistakes God Don't Make Mistakes we we
[1:23:19] you know what so many times we're
[1:23:20] running out here and ignoring God right
[1:23:22] Among Us amen praise the Lord I'm not
[1:23:25] talking about we don't have friends out
[1:23:27] there that's not what I'm saying don't
[1:23:28] misinterpret me but I'm talking about
[1:23:31] standing with
[1:23:33] conviction standing with a real
[1:23:36] conviction and under the anointing of
[1:23:38] the Holy Spirit and I think that's a
[1:23:39] part that even as as real Godly sisters
[1:23:42] that you would desire that for for your
[1:23:45] husband to be a real leader in the home
[1:23:47] Amen to be one who has caed together
[1:23:50] devotions you know what you know what
[1:23:51] brother Brown said concerning David's
[1:23:54] dad
[1:23:55] you know what he called him brother BR
[1:23:57] called him a great man of God and you
[1:23:59] know why he says that he said because he
[1:24:01] got his family together for devotions
[1:24:03] right so a great man of God don't have
[1:24:06] to be somebody that walks on the water
[1:24:08] right a great man of God just simply
[1:24:10] calling together Lord this word we want
[1:24:12] this word to be the influence in our
[1:24:15] life oh my to standing with conviction
[1:24:18] I'm not going to give up in the ground
[1:24:19] how about you I'm not going to give up
[1:24:22] any ground I don't want to take back any
[1:24:25] ground if there's anything at all if
[1:24:27] somebody takes a picture of you
[1:24:29] today if you have receded from where you
[1:24:33] were your backs
[1:24:35] lit I'm talking about in your heart and
[1:24:38] in your fervency but you know what
[1:24:39] there's a fix to
[1:24:41] that we're not without hope there's a
[1:24:43] fix to that if we'll be honest with God
[1:24:47] and say Lord I need a fresh refilling I
[1:24:50] don't know about you but you know this
[1:24:51] is unlimited refills this isn't the
[1:24:53] jokes like the rest
[1:24:54] pay cuz a matter of fact you you pay you
[1:24:57] know what is it I don't know 1025 for
[1:24:59] for a Coke it's kind of exaggerating a
[1:25:02] little bit who knows if it is Coke or
[1:25:05] not but you pay for it and then
[1:25:07] unlimited refills really you can get
[1:25:11] full on that pretty quick but think
[1:25:12] about this you don't it's not something
[1:25:15] that you have purchased God made
[1:25:17] available for you and I brother it's
[1:25:20] unlimited refills you don't got to wait
[1:25:22] till you get to the house of God to get
[1:25:24] a real dose and a refilling of the Holy
[1:25:27] Spirit just you have the opportunity to
[1:25:29] steal away with God and say Lord I need
[1:25:32] a fresh refilling of the Holy
[1:25:35] Spirit notice and and when you look at
[1:25:37] this of how that you know when you see
[1:25:40] how God would approach this with Joshua
[1:25:42] remember what God told Joshua he told
[1:25:44] him and admonished him to be strong and
[1:25:47] of a good courage why because as I was
[1:25:49] with Moses I will be with thee also be
[1:25:53] strong and very courageous God would
[1:25:55] speak of this over and over now I want
[1:25:57] you to think he spoke to him to be
[1:25:59] strong and courageous that he might
[1:26:01] observe to do all that is wrote in the
[1:26:04] law according to
[1:26:06] Moses now this very important because
[1:26:08] it's not just do according to all the
[1:26:11] law what you think the law says see
[1:26:15] we're living and we're we're kind of
[1:26:16] getting it seems like some of those
[1:26:17] things are starting to drift right back
[1:26:19] in among
[1:26:20] us but do the law according to what
[1:26:23] Moses has said in other words not our
[1:26:27] interpretation but what God has said
[1:26:29] through Moses let me just say this all
[1:26:32] the way through the church age book The
[1:26:34] Prophet lays it down clear the true
[1:26:36] evidence of the baptism of the Holy
[1:26:39] Ghost is to not only be able to hear the
[1:26:41] word but receive the word and walk in
[1:26:44] unity with that
[1:26:46] word that's the plum line where it has
[1:26:49] changed our very nature and there's an
[1:26:51] amen on the word when the word comes to
[1:26:54] correct us and the word shows us when
[1:26:56] we're wrong there's an amen on the
[1:26:58] inside that says so be it Lord so be it
[1:27:01] unto me Lord God why because you can't
[1:27:05] have the Holy Ghost without having the
[1:27:07] word in your life these three are one
[1:27:11] Hallelujah the Father the word and the
[1:27:14] spirit is that right so the real coming
[1:27:17] of the Holy Spirit the boldness it
[1:27:19] brings is a boldness by divine
[1:27:21] revelation to stand on the revealed word
[1:27:24] of the
[1:27:28] hour no matter how many websites and
[1:27:30] whatever more I hate to be standing in
[1:27:32] those guys
[1:27:34] shoes come on see God permitted all that
[1:27:37] stuff God permitted it we could try to
[1:27:39] say oh my we're going oh man if we could
[1:27:41] have just kept that down no God
[1:27:43] permitted it listen Paul remember there
[1:27:45] was some guys hus and valitus that they
[1:27:48] got out there and they started teaching
[1:27:50] certain things and the Bible said the
[1:27:52] faith of many were overthrown but it
[1:27:54] didn't Shake God one bit God let him
[1:27:57] know the foundation of God standeth
[1:27:59] assure and let me tell you when you're
[1:28:01] born of the spirit of God you're born of
[1:28:04] the word you are a part of the same
[1:28:06] Foundation that the apostles and the
[1:28:08] prophets are built on and there's no
[1:28:10] other Foundation but Jesus Christ the
[1:28:13] word hallelujah though the gates of hell
[1:28:16] is hell but yet this rock it will hold
[1:28:19] you it will keep you there is an anchor
[1:28:22] that holds you no matter what winds of
[1:28:24] Doctrine and confusion fly out there's a
[1:28:27] boldness to stay with the revealed word
[1:28:30] of the
[1:28:30] [Applause]
[1:28:35] hour so you want to know whether you
[1:28:37] have the Holy Ghost or not is your life
[1:28:40] yoke to the
[1:28:41] word is it Yol to the word in every way
[1:28:45] well well brother Samuel it all is but
[1:28:47] this and maybe my dress and maybe my
[1:28:50] this well then it's not yolked all the
[1:28:51] way you need to get yolked all the way
[1:28:55] yes Amen to recognize friends we didn't
[1:28:58] have nothing to do with
[1:29:01] this let me read you a little statement
[1:29:05] here oh my brother brm says this is all
[1:29:09] it's not mother is there it's not
[1:29:11] because she's there that I'm saved it's
[1:29:14] because God chose me in Christ not you
[1:29:17] choosing yourself not your choice how
[1:29:19] much you prayed when you turned a new
[1:29:21] page you had nothing to do with it amen
[1:29:25] you say you you mean that I didn't turn
[1:29:27] to the Lord no sir you had no way at all
[1:29:30] of turning to the Lord your whole nature
[1:29:33] your whole makeup was against God God
[1:29:36] called you it's always been that way see
[1:29:39] this is where our boldness begins to be
[1:29:41] built because if our boldness is well in
[1:29:44] one night I really CED tears at the
[1:29:48] altar one night I did this one night I
[1:29:51] did that I I'm not against crying tears
[1:29:53] that's not what I'm I'm saying you
[1:29:54] understand what I'm talking about now
[1:29:56] amen I I what what I'm trying to say is
[1:29:59] is that it wasn't you seeking for
[1:30:02] God it was God that came seeking for you
[1:30:06] cuz God wasn't lost we were
[1:30:10] lost that's right we were the ones help
[1:30:14] where you at I don't know where I'm at I
[1:30:16] know where you're
[1:30:17] at I know where you're at and I'm coming
[1:30:20] to get you listen you might be in a
[1:30:23] condition like I was I didn't know how
[1:30:25] to get out I didn't even know where do I
[1:30:27] even begin my life is so twisted up and
[1:30:30] in shambles and everything up brother
[1:30:32] Samuel you were a pastor's son what does
[1:30:35] that have to do with it that's I got out
[1:30:38] there in the influence it wouldn't
[1:30:39] matter if I have sat here on the Pew
[1:30:41] which I did I came to the house of God
[1:30:43] but I had to meet God for myself and
[1:30:46] thank God I had a mom and daddy that
[1:30:48] didn't look at me and say well he's
[1:30:49] going to church man everything's all
[1:30:51] right but they had met God in a personal
[1:30:54] way and they were living with a
[1:30:56] confidence in their life and said though
[1:30:58] the situation looks dark but I've Got
[1:31:00] Confidence in what the token did for me
[1:31:03] when the token comes upon him I'm
[1:31:05] holding it over him with a prayer he
[1:31:08] belongs to me when that takes effect
[1:31:10] it'll change his life like it changed my
[1:31:14] [Applause]
[1:31:17] life yes sir
[1:31:20] hallelujah hallelujah amen he would have
[1:31:24] been easier for for for many of us to
[1:31:27] get out to untangle fishing line than to
[1:31:29] untangle a mess in our
[1:31:31] lives but I'm glad God's grace comes
[1:31:36] down he said this is what I'm here
[1:31:39] for Lord you don't even know how to get
[1:31:42] this knot untangled no but I know what's
[1:31:43] needed to take care of it I'm I I I know
[1:31:46] how to untangle that life I know what
[1:31:48] lays beneath that
[1:31:51] life oh my this is where we want to be
[1:31:53] able to stand like Steven where the
[1:31:55] Bible says there is a boldness that
[1:31:58] moved upon his life where the Bible says
[1:32:00] that his
[1:32:02] face
[1:32:04] Shone like an
[1:32:07] angel now think about this the Bible
[1:32:09] tells us in the Book of Ecclesiastes
[1:32:11] that man's Wisdom like when man figures
[1:32:13] something out has an aha moment man you
[1:32:17] know you can tell it you can tell it you
[1:32:20] can also tell when somebody's coming in
[1:32:21] in a faker going to offer up a word
[1:32:23] salad or something like that you can
[1:32:26] tell you can
[1:32:27] tell right oh oh my goodness where are
[1:32:30] my notes at you can
[1:32:33] tell
[1:32:34] right but but you know how it is when
[1:32:37] there's a confidence when you've went in
[1:32:39] to a presentation I've had to give
[1:32:40] presentations when I was at work and
[1:32:42] other things for Grants and things to
[1:32:43] State and so forth and all those things
[1:32:45] there's a confidence that you have when
[1:32:47] you walk in there it's like a aha or
[1:32:49] there's a problem that comes up at home
[1:32:51] and you're trying to figure out how do I
[1:32:52] do this how do I do that how do I figure
[1:32:54] out this Plumbing how do I do this
[1:32:55] wiring how do I do this how do I do that
[1:32:57] and all of a sudden the aha
[1:32:59] moment right oh man it it has an effect
[1:33:03] on
[1:33:04] everything has an effect I mean your
[1:33:07] wife's cooking tastes
[1:33:10] good it might be a burnt offering but it
[1:33:12] tastes good because you've got the
[1:33:15] answer that's right that's right well I
[1:33:19] I I don't say things like that to be
[1:33:21] funny but you know brother bam says
[1:33:22] there's times he said you'll notice he
[1:33:23] says I'll say certain things in a
[1:33:25] certain way to make you laugh he said
[1:33:27] and then I'll say to get it right back
[1:33:29] on track right I know where I'm at in
[1:33:32] quotes I know where I'm
[1:33:35] at but I say it in this way that when
[1:33:39] that wisdom is dropped upon our life it
[1:33:41] doesn't matter what takes place man
[1:33:44] we've got the answer to this solution
[1:33:46] right I hope you're not looking for
[1:33:48] Solutions while you're sitting here in
[1:33:49] church like trying to figure out the
[1:33:51] electrical wiring diagram in your home I
[1:33:53] I trust you say Lord I just commit that
[1:33:55] to you now it might drop while you're
[1:33:57] right here I guarantee you one thing if
[1:33:59] my brother-in-law receives some sort of
[1:34:01] an inspiration about a program that he
[1:34:03] is writing or working on we'll all know
[1:34:06] it you might think he's in the spirit
[1:34:08] cuz he's sitting in here but it might
[1:34:10] just be because he's got an wisdom and
[1:34:12] inspiration about a problem I have drove
[1:34:14] him in the car before when he's R
[1:34:17] reading books and I have been with him
[1:34:18] at breakfast and other places and there
[1:34:20] is no places off limits when he received
[1:34:24] the certain partition of a code that he
[1:34:26] needs to actually write oh there it is
[1:34:30] it doesn't matter could scare everybody
[1:34:31] to death in the restaurant now that's
[1:34:32] just how he's made up that wisdom will
[1:34:35] drop that way now if that will happen
[1:34:38] within that of a natural man what will
[1:34:41] it do when that wisdom that comes from
[1:34:44] above that's full as James said of Mercy
[1:34:47] it's pure it's full of joy when that
[1:34:50] drops down into your
[1:34:52] life it's like the wisdom that drops
[1:34:55] into your life when all of a sudden
[1:34:56] you've been looking and you've been
[1:34:58] wondering and it drops into your life
[1:35:00] the revelation of Jesus Christ and you
[1:35:02] say I'm saved I'm free what is it you're
[1:35:05] not speaking something of an imagination
[1:35:08] but it was a thought of God that came by
[1:35:10] a word and has been deposited in your
[1:35:13] life and you watch it's not you changing
[1:35:16] your life but it's
[1:35:18] Christ it's Christ and the old leaves
[1:35:23] drop up
[1:35:25] and new leaves come on
[1:35:31] hallelujah oh my like brother Bram said
[1:35:34] he said I don't believe he said it was a
[1:35:36] an angel he said some great light that
[1:35:37] was there around Stephen he said what it
[1:35:39] was as he said a he was a messenger he
[1:35:43] said he was standing there with a
[1:35:46] boldness and a confidence cuz he knew
[1:35:48] what he was talking
[1:35:49] about ain't that blessing I think of
[1:35:53] right here we've got young people right
[1:35:54] here that could sit right there with
[1:35:56] theologians now I'm not for
[1:35:58] debating I'm not for debating the word's
[1:36:00] not to be
[1:36:02] debated you convince Somebody by
[1:36:04] debating then they'll be somebody
[1:36:06] smarter they'll be able to do this
[1:36:07] around we don't know God by debating
[1:36:09] right we know God by Revelation amen and
[1:36:13] Revelation is not something we can
[1:36:14] explain oh I can pivot it this way and I
[1:36:16] can pivot it this way I can pivot it
[1:36:18] this way but when you know God by divine
[1:36:20] revelation you could set right down
[1:36:22] think about it think about you you as
[1:36:24] young people could sit right down and
[1:36:25] there are individuals that are going to
[1:36:27] school right now to study and how to
[1:36:29] explain the Trinity good
[1:36:34] luck that's good you know what that TR
[1:36:38] you know what that Trinity Doctrine is
[1:36:39] it's a doctrine of
[1:36:42] devils you know what it is it's split
[1:36:44] God always he's in three persons that's
[1:36:46] called a
[1:36:47] schizophrenic by the way split
[1:36:51] personalities you know why Satan did
[1:36:53] that the prophet told us he told you
[1:36:55] that lie to make a heathen out of
[1:36:58] you is that right you know what the
[1:37:00] ultimate objective why he's done that
[1:37:03] and done that in the name instead of
[1:37:05] taking the real name of Jesus Christ but
[1:37:07] it's taken titles instead because he
[1:37:10] wants to move the objective from the
[1:37:13] relationship God above us God With Us
[1:37:17] God in us that it's the same God and you
[1:37:20] are a part of the mystery of God
[1:37:24] but in the evening time there shall be
[1:37:28] light in the evening
[1:37:32] time Hallelujah and there's a people who
[1:37:35] know their God there's a people who have
[1:37:38] experienced the Redeeming Grace of
[1:37:40] almighty God
[1:37:47] hallu you might say brother Samuel maybe
[1:37:49] it's a sister maybe brother Samuel I
[1:37:51] couldn't lick scripture to scripture to
[1:37:53] scripture to scripture but there is one
[1:37:55] thing that's what's important is what's
[1:37:57] anchored in your heart that you'll never
[1:37:59] be ashamed of the revelation of Jesus
[1:38:01] Christ I know in whom I have believed
[1:38:04] and I'm persuaded that he is able I know
[1:38:06] that it's not God broke down into three
[1:38:08] persons but I know it's God operating in
[1:38:11] three Divine attributes just like I am a
[1:38:15] son I'm a father I'm a husband but I'm
[1:38:18] the same person the whole time this is
[1:38:20] why it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:38:23] today and forever Jehovah of the old is
[1:38:27] Jesus of the
[1:38:29] new
[1:38:31] hallelujah amen in that same life that
[1:38:33] was in that sacrifice that came back on
[1:38:36] the day of Pentecost to get a hold of
[1:38:38] you and I and make the pardoning grace
[1:38:41] of God a reality in our lives amen
[1:38:45] hallelujah my M I feel
[1:38:49] good thank you Lord
[1:38:56] I'm getting
[1:38:57] somewhere now you said you weren't going
[1:38:59] to hold them first minutes against
[1:39:01] me but I've got to get it somewhere
[1:39:04] here there has to be you see for this
[1:39:07] boldness it requires a relationship
[1:39:09] status
[1:39:10] change now a lot of young people know
[1:39:12] this everybody you know this is like the
[1:39:14] going
[1:39:15] thing in and out in and out in and out
[1:39:18] in and
[1:39:19] out I'm relationship I'm really but I'm
[1:39:23] I'm talking about that I'm talking about
[1:39:25] where there's a relationship status
[1:39:27] change that comes in our
[1:39:30] lives in the Book of John you'll read
[1:39:33] how when the Lord
[1:39:35] Jesus he spoke to the to the disciples
[1:39:37] and he said I'm not going to call you
[1:39:40] servants any longer I'm going to call
[1:39:43] you friends what was it relationship
[1:39:46] status
[1:39:48] update then after the resurrection he
[1:39:51] said no longer going to call you friends
[1:39:53] why was he calling him friends he was
[1:39:55] going to make known no longer am I going
[1:39:56] to keep from you I'm going to make it
[1:39:57] known to
[1:39:58] you then after the resurrection he said
[1:40:02] I call you
[1:40:05] Brethren see the now what's being put
[1:40:07] before him the same access of
[1:40:10] all that God was in Christ amen
[1:40:14] hallelujah and all that all that Christ
[1:40:17] was he had poured into the church we are
[1:40:19] Brethren which lets us know we have a
[1:40:23] right to the same life am then the then
[1:40:28] the relationship status
[1:40:30] changes to sons of God being now fully
[1:40:33] manifested sons of God the whole time
[1:40:36] but they went from being servants
[1:40:38] friends Brethren to now manifested sons
[1:40:41] of
[1:40:42] God I'd say that's quite a relationship
[1:40:45] status
[1:40:46] update because when they came out of the
[1:40:48] upper room they went in there
[1:40:50] cowards hello they went in there cowards
[1:40:54] but when the Holy Ghost came it gave
[1:40:57] them a boldness to stand on the word
[1:41:00] though all Jerusalem and all around was
[1:41:03] against it but what happened the
[1:41:05] anointing of the spirit of God the lion
[1:41:08] of the tribe of Judah it entered in and
[1:41:10] they came out
[1:41:12] there it was a roaring out of what was
[1:41:15] in their
[1:41:17] [Applause]
[1:41:19] life oh my this is why in the latter
[1:41:23] part of this scripture I have to read
[1:41:24] this this is why that we're through this
[1:41:26] one offering there don't need to be
[1:41:28] another offering come again come on
[1:41:30] we're thinking about communion now I'm
[1:41:32] thinking about this boldness this
[1:41:34] relationship there doesn't have to come
[1:41:36] forth another offering for by one
[1:41:38] offering he has perfected ever them that
[1:41:41] are
[1:41:42] Sanctified this is why the revelation of
[1:41:45] Jesus Christ the spirit of God moving
[1:41:48] throughout the congregation is to sound
[1:41:50] the Jubilee trumpet to you to let you
[1:41:53] know know that he has paid the sin debt
[1:41:56] for
[1:41:58] you the trumpet sounds to your life
[1:42:01] conviction strikes our heart and a way
[1:42:03] becomes open what is it we're seeing
[1:42:06] Jesus Christ Our Passover Lamb we're
[1:42:08] seeing him the atonement we're seeing
[1:42:11] him the one the ransom for all sin he is
[1:42:16] My Kinsman
[1:42:18] hallu this is why in verse 19 having
[1:42:20] therefore Brethren boldness to enter
[1:42:23] into the holiest by the blood of Jesus
[1:42:25] in other words I'm not coming into this
[1:42:29] with I don't know if I'm not we we'll
[1:42:32] never be worthy he has made us worthy
[1:42:35] that's right that's right you see the
[1:42:36] boldness that I'm coming by is because
[1:42:39] like Esther when she was coming into the
[1:42:40] court when she came in there said I
[1:42:42] don't know I want y'all to be praying
[1:42:43] because if he don't hold out the scepter
[1:42:45] to me I'm dead but you see when she came
[1:42:47] in the court he had the scepter he held
[1:42:50] it out it was extended to her you know
[1:42:52] what that was a sign of that your
[1:42:54] request your approach feel free to
[1:42:56] approach the
[1:42:59] throne that's what this message is it
[1:43:02] reveals the king of glory let me preach
[1:43:05] now out in Sabino Canyon the prophet
[1:43:09] received the sword of the king in his
[1:43:11] hand it was a word that's been extended
[1:43:14] to you and I and the word is not against
[1:43:16] you but the word has come to cut away
[1:43:19] all unbelief and bring us to the
[1:43:21] rightful approach you you are his queen
[1:43:24] you are his bride you are his chosen
[1:43:27] approach the throne freely through the
[1:43:30] way that's been made for you what is it
[1:43:33] an entrance as Peter said has been
[1:43:36] ministered unto you into the
[1:43:40] Capstone my my my my my my my my
[1:43:44] my by a New and Living Way which he had
[1:43:46] consecrated for us through the veil that
[1:43:49] is to say his flesh and having a high
[1:43:51] priest over the house of God let us draw
[1:43:53] near with a True Heart in full Assurance
[1:43:56] of Faith having our hearts sprinkled
[1:43:59] from an evil conscience and our bodies
[1:44:01] washed with pure water the prophet said
[1:44:04] sprinkled there means shook away our
[1:44:07] conscience the sin problem evil and
[1:44:10] darkness shook off of it with our bodies
[1:44:12] washed with pure water through the water
[1:44:14] baptism in the name of Jesus Christ we
[1:44:17] can walk freely and boldly up to God
[1:44:18] knowing this are you with me the evil
[1:44:22] that I once loved has passed away that's
[1:44:25] good knowing that the life that I once
[1:44:27] lived is now ceased not because I did it
[1:44:31] because something come in me and did it
[1:44:34] itself by Grace he saved me I believed
[1:44:38] him he gave me the Holy Ghost the things
[1:44:40] that I once hated I now love the
[1:44:43] sacrifice it used to be hard for me to
[1:44:45] go to church I love to go now to hear
[1:44:48] the people sing and shout and testify
[1:44:50] used to hate it but I love it now
[1:44:53] something has changed in me then I have
[1:44:56] a New and Living Way something has
[1:44:59] anchored
[1:45:02] there
[1:45:06] Hallelujah you know why because you know
[1:45:09] what's happened in your life see that
[1:45:11] that's where the real shout and real Joy
[1:45:12] comes from it don't come because you
[1:45:14] know little little Aaron man he's all
[1:45:17] excited so I'm getting all excited no he
[1:45:18] he should be all excited because of the
[1:45:20] joy of the Lord that's striking his
[1:45:21] heart and when the joy the Lord strikes
[1:45:23] your heart you will be excited and
[1:45:25] joyful in the way that God has made you
[1:45:27] you might get a little bit beside
[1:45:28] yourself you might get a little bit so
[1:45:30] far out of your order or out of somebody
[1:45:33] else's order but you have got your soul
[1:45:35] and realized I have come back into the
[1:45:37] divine order of God there is peace with
[1:45:40] God there is an
[1:45:42] unreserved in my
[1:45:44] life that's
[1:45:46] right you see friends what this word is
[1:45:49] doing it's to liberate you
[1:45:53] when we talk about the ministering of
[1:45:54] the evidence of the Holy Ghost why do
[1:45:56] you think when you read every single age
[1:46:00] Church age through the church age
[1:46:04] book that's a separate subject I love to
[1:46:07] tackle one of these days on that book
[1:46:10] because there's been a lot of false
[1:46:11] things said against that that I could go
[1:46:14] to task on that you know why a lot of
[1:46:15] that's been said because it troubles
[1:46:17] their
[1:46:19] doctrines the prophet claimed that book
[1:46:21] as his own book yes
[1:46:24] he once again I'm not interested in
[1:46:26] tampering with the word am but there's a
[1:46:29] lot of stories I could give on oh no we
[1:46:31] don't do that it might help you out and
[1:46:33] get you straightened out cuz the prophet
[1:46:35] said I put my Doctrine right in
[1:46:38] there come on don't let a man put a
[1:46:40] scarecrow over you just because he a
[1:46:43] scarecrow is not for Eagles it's for
[1:46:46] [Applause]
[1:46:48] Crows Hall brother Samy you're speaking
[1:46:50] that pretty boldly I know where I'm
[1:46:52] standing amen I know where I'm standing
[1:46:55] Hall I'm not up here to cheerlead and
[1:46:57] pump you up I know where I'm standing on
[1:47:00] the word of God I've sat at many a table
[1:47:03] or I've had men sit right across from me
[1:47:05] and want to challenge on that book but
[1:47:07] God gives Grace we can go right down the
[1:47:09] line on so many other things you don't
[1:47:11] eventually says well this is just where
[1:47:12] we stand I'll tell you God helped me to
[1:47:14] never have that kind of an attitude
[1:47:16] where I cannot bow to the word of God
[1:47:19] when it's presented to me come on
[1:47:22] Friends
[1:47:24] not because of me but because of God's
[1:47:26] word this is where God's bringing us
[1:47:28] away from the traditions of man checking
[1:47:31] to see can I listen to this song let me
[1:47:33] go see what so and so says if they're
[1:47:34] your Holy Ghost then maybe you need to
[1:47:36] go ask them oh if I can read this book
[1:47:39] If there your absolute and your Holy
[1:47:41] Ghost then maybe you do but if you ever
[1:47:43] get the Holy Ghost in the absolute of
[1:47:45] your soul there is a holy ghost on the
[1:47:47] inside where your heart has become the
[1:47:49] Judgment seat of Christ and if there's
[1:47:50] something that's not right it'll re
[1:47:53] in your heart and let you
[1:47:57] know
[1:47:59] Hallelujah and if it's sin and
[1:48:00] everything else in the world and it
[1:48:01] don't bother you to read it and listen
[1:48:03] to it then you need to check what kind
[1:48:04] of spirit's in you because what can feed
[1:48:06] on that shows it's got some G on the
[1:48:08] inside and a dove don't have
[1:48:14] G
[1:48:15] Hallelujah now look at this relationship
[1:48:18] status and this change
[1:48:24] now you're a message believer you know
[1:48:26] that the prophet of God he didn't start
[1:48:28] on this in the seals this is all the way
[1:48:30] back in the early parts of the message
[1:48:32] he'll refer to this but he really lays
[1:48:34] it in real strong in God hidden in
[1:48:36] Simplicity on the opening of the
[1:48:39] seals because you see when you think of
[1:48:41] it that there was nothing that could
[1:48:44] bring man back into the
[1:48:46] relationship that God intended for him
[1:48:49] to have it would take and could only
[1:48:52] come through R him by the blood of Jesus
[1:48:56] Christ it would take God coming down and
[1:48:59] becoming one of
[1:49:01] us to shed his blood for you and I
[1:49:05] brother Bram was asked the question in
[1:49:07] one place what about one as it says in
[1:49:10] the scriptures if one was
[1:49:12] born you know out of out of wedlock and
[1:49:15] this and that is that possible for them
[1:49:16] to enter in you know to the congregation
[1:49:19] and brother Bram just simply answers
[1:49:21] that he says you know as as they
[1:49:23] couldn't enter in till generation many
[1:49:25] many many many generations later but
[1:49:26] brother BR said the reason that couldn't
[1:49:29] be is because there wasn't nothing
[1:49:31] strong
[1:49:33] enough to take care of that sin you know
[1:49:37] why God allowed that to be concluded
[1:49:39] because it showed that there was nothing
[1:49:41] the blood of bulls and goats could only
[1:49:44] cover a problem that was there so good
[1:49:48] are you with me the problem was still
[1:49:49] there it could only cover it it couldn't
[1:49:51] remit it or get get rid of it the blood
[1:49:55] of bulls and goats couldn't do that is
[1:49:57] that right no but notice that within
[1:50:00] this when this blood is come it has the
[1:50:03] strength within it to
[1:50:06] undo that condition in that life it has
[1:50:09] the power to be able to
[1:50:13] loosen us from
[1:50:16] sin the blood of Jesus Christ is strong
[1:50:19] enough now every one of us you know
[1:50:21] brother br allude this to where like if
[1:50:24] it's a drop of ink yeah you know and he
[1:50:27] said that drop of ink when it gets
[1:50:29] dropped in Bleach there's chemicals in
[1:50:32] that bleach that begin to deal with the
[1:50:34] compounds that have come together to
[1:50:36] make that
[1:50:38] ink and the bleach
[1:50:41] dismantles that drop of ink and bringing
[1:50:44] it back to its original form right now
[1:50:50] listen it's just like when you've had
[1:50:52] stains every every one of us have had
[1:50:53] stains I for myself personally I Don't
[1:50:55] Wear Ties I don't trust myself wearing
[1:50:56] ties and eating I I don't even really
[1:50:59] like to I don't like drink coffee with a
[1:51:00] tie on I'm I'm just that's just me I'm
[1:51:02] I'm afraid of it of doing it that way
[1:51:04] but every one of us have had stains on
[1:51:06] clothes yes right I know for me usually
[1:51:09] I'm asking I look at my wife honey was
[1:51:11] this going to come out honey is this
[1:51:12] yeah yeah yeah it's going to come out
[1:51:14] it's going to come out you know we've
[1:51:15] got oxy we've got shout we've got all
[1:51:17] these other things that are stain
[1:51:19] removers and you know I got to looking
[1:51:21] in on this right here of those stain
[1:51:22] removers and clock she's got to doing
[1:51:24] just a study on that of how when the
[1:51:26] prophet would tell us that When sin is
[1:51:30] confessed it is dropped in the bleach of
[1:51:35] almighty God the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:51:39] and you realize what those stain
[1:51:40] removers bleach and all those other
[1:51:42] things every one of them there's almost
[1:51:43] like four different four different areas
[1:51:45] of how that they'll work because a lot
[1:51:46] of times a stain what's really
[1:51:48] incredible is that a stain itself some
[1:51:50] of you probably think man I'm getting
[1:51:51] educated on stain removal no stay with
[1:51:53] me now because you see within it a lot
[1:51:55] of times within a stain there are
[1:51:57] multiple Parts within that stain that
[1:52:00] compounds that needs to be dealt with
[1:52:02] and this is why then when you have that
[1:52:04] of that bleach or that stain remover it
[1:52:06] is there to deal with all of that
[1:52:09] mixture let me tell you friends we just
[1:52:11] weren't didn't have well I need this one
[1:52:12] area fixed I need this one area fixed I
[1:52:15] need just this thing fixed we needed
[1:52:17] something that could take care of the
[1:52:19] full sin question
[1:52:23] and the blood of Jesus Christ let me
[1:52:25] tell you what it does it comes in and it
[1:52:28] breaks down sends hold When sin is
[1:52:33] confessed and when I got the studying on
[1:52:36] this you know what stain removers do
[1:52:38] I'll tell you what they do the stain
[1:52:39] removers it says that well you know it's
[1:52:41] like the food that you when you eat it's
[1:52:43] like digested and broken down in your
[1:52:46] body there are enzymes in stain removers
[1:52:49] that can break down the proteins in in
[1:52:52] the stains into smaller
[1:52:55] chunks I wish I had more time to preach
[1:52:58] on this you see when the blood of Jesus
[1:53:00] Christ begins to be ministered into your
[1:53:03] life and begins to bring conviction it
[1:53:05] can look you can take a problem that
[1:53:07] seems like a great big stain but in the
[1:53:10] presence of Jesus Christ man get it
[1:53:13] underneath the blood and what seems so
[1:53:16] big it begins to smaller chunks it
[1:53:19] begins to be broken apart all the AR
[1:53:22] arguments and all the accusations that
[1:53:25] the enemy is want to put upon your life
[1:53:27] begins to be
[1:53:29] dismantled through the blood of Jesus
[1:53:32] Christ and let me just tell you the
[1:53:34] blood of Jesus Christ isn't something
[1:53:36] that I'm looking back that I got to go
[1:53:37] over to Israel and try to excavate
[1:53:39] something that's in the earth remember
[1:53:42] the chemicals the literal physical
[1:53:44] chemicals have broke down and went right
[1:53:47] down in the ground but the life that was
[1:53:49] within that blood has come back and it's
[1:53:52] that life itself that is the voice of
[1:53:55] the blood that speaks better things it's
[1:53:59] that voice that calls you and I and says
[1:54:01] to you and I come
[1:54:05] home hallu it deals the stain remover
[1:54:09] deals with the
[1:54:11] enzymes it breaks it into fragments so
[1:54:14] it can be washed
[1:54:16] away that's right it dismantles sin's
[1:54:19] hold oh don't you love the Lord yes see
[1:54:23] this is why friends listen now this is
[1:54:26] why that within it when we look at of
[1:54:29] the blood being applied everybody all
[1:54:31] right amen I'm getting there I'm getting
[1:54:33] there this is why when we look at the
[1:54:35] blood being applied hey I don't want to
[1:54:38] stop this would be like stopping and not
[1:54:39] serving
[1:54:41] dessert I know I could always break it
[1:54:43] up but I I don't when we're in the
[1:54:45] middle of a throne right here I'm just
[1:54:46] let me get to this point this is where
[1:54:48] it's got to come a thorough
[1:54:50] repentance not a repentance of sorry of
[1:54:53] the condition we're in but you know what
[1:54:55] real repentance is it's just like when
[1:54:57] like brother BR says like this he says
[1:54:59] if I was to say something to my wife he
[1:55:01] said and it wouldn't be right he said in
[1:55:03] my heart I would feel sorry he said
[1:55:07] right there I'm forgiven
[1:55:09] but I have to tell her I'm sorry that's
[1:55:13] part of
[1:55:15] repentance and he said that's the same
[1:55:17] way it is with
[1:55:18] God see thorough repentance begins in
[1:55:22] the
[1:55:24] heart everybody with me now it begins in
[1:55:28] the heart to where the conviction of the
[1:55:30] holy spirit let me just tell you this
[1:55:32] right here let's put the devil on notice
[1:55:34] oh brother Samuel I feel judged well I
[1:55:36] hope the word does judge you I hope it
[1:55:37] judges every one of us and I hope if
[1:55:40] we're not right I hope this conviction
[1:55:41] power of God so strikes our hearts into
[1:55:43] such a place that we'll come into such
[1:55:45] humility and say Lord I want to be
[1:55:48] right that's what kind that's a
[1:55:50] conviction we want you we want God to
[1:55:52] stand that way don't we we want him to
[1:55:54] stand that way he is standing in this
[1:55:56] hour is that
[1:55:59] right so repentance it comes from the
[1:56:01] inside out this is why with so many
[1:56:04] times where it's missed we think of
[1:56:06] repentance as just well I'm just saying
[1:56:08] that I'm sorry but it begins with that
[1:56:10] real
[1:56:11] true abor this is scriptural of what's
[1:56:15] been done you recognize Lord forgive me
[1:56:19] Lord Jesus I don't want me many you
[1:56:22] whether you've come to the altar maybe
[1:56:23] it was out you know when you were in
[1:56:25] your bedroom or something like that
[1:56:26] maybe you out driving your car I don't
[1:56:27] know where the spirit of God would begin
[1:56:28] to deal with your life and finally it
[1:56:29] comes that place of Lord forgive me it's
[1:56:32] got to start somewhere but see it begins
[1:56:34] with God dealing with your heart I
[1:56:36] remember how God dealt with my heart God
[1:56:37] was dealing with my heart long before I
[1:56:40] it ever echoed out of here God was
[1:56:41] dealing with my life there was things
[1:56:43] roadblocks almost got my life taken away
[1:56:45] in the flats right before God got a hold
[1:56:47] of my life I tell you what it was the
[1:56:49] mercy of God that God was already
[1:56:50] dealing my life showing me things that
[1:56:52] hey this and this and this and this but
[1:56:53] you know what it had to be God come and
[1:56:57] finally it came to that place where that
[1:57:00] really settled into My Heart Lord
[1:57:02] forgive me H did you know how I I didn't
[1:57:05] know Lord I I don't know I've tried I've
[1:57:07] tried before I've tried but forgive me
[1:57:10] for Where I Am Lord I don't want to I
[1:57:12] don't want to do this no more I want to
[1:57:13] serve you but I don't know
[1:57:16] how I I don't know how Lord I I can't
[1:57:19] find the strength I don't know how I
[1:57:21] don't know how Lord but I need you Lord
[1:57:25] forgive me it started in here but it
[1:57:28] came out here because you know why I
[1:57:30] tried before but that's always the
[1:57:33] that's always the error us trying see
[1:57:36] Satan wants to put it that's your effort
[1:57:38] it's not your
[1:57:40] effort I'm not here because of Samuel
[1:57:42] Browning's effort I'm here because of
[1:57:46] his grace you're here because of his
[1:57:50] grace I didn't quit doing this and quit
[1:57:53] doing that but he became lifted up
[1:57:55] before me that Lord I don't want to do
[1:57:58] anything Lord that displeases
[1:58:01] you
[1:58:03] hallu it's from the inside out that's
[1:58:05] that's real
[1:58:07] repentance that's where the blood
[1:58:09] becomes applied in our
[1:58:12] lives you know where that comes
[1:58:15] down it comes down just like it was with
[1:58:19] Moses when he stood there
[1:58:22] and he came to that place in Exodus
[1:58:26] 14 the enemy and the taskmasters were
[1:58:29] behind
[1:58:31] him and Moses said stand
[1:58:35] still and see the salvation of the
[1:58:39] Lord he spoke with an
[1:58:42] unreserved
[1:58:45] courage and when he spoke and god notice
[1:58:49] what God he turns back around and God
[1:58:50] says don't cry to me
[1:58:52] speak that the people go forward hold
[1:58:55] out that judgment Rod over those Waters
[1:58:57] he held that judgment Rod out over there
[1:58:59] you know what that was a type of it was
[1:59:01] a type of the name of Jesus Christ and
[1:59:03] the deity of God's own life in it and
[1:59:06] those Waters
[1:59:08] parted and Moses told him the Egyptians
[1:59:11] that you see
[1:59:13] today you ain't going to see them no
[1:59:16] more God Made A Way on dry ground they
[1:59:19] weren't walking like out here when it
[1:59:21] rains this ground is squishy mushy maybe
[1:59:24] in some of your yards it's that way the
[1:59:27] Bible said that East Wind came and made
[1:59:29] a dry ground let me tell you if God is
[1:59:32] requiring you to walk through his word
[1:59:34] he's able to give you the strength to
[1:59:37] stand on Solid Ground cuz every pathway
[1:59:40] that the word makes for you it's Solid
[1:59:43] Ground and Moses let him know that the
[1:59:46] Egyptians you saw today this is the
[1:59:50] last when they got over on the other
[1:59:52] side than the Egyptians they tried to
[1:59:56] come that same way but they weren't
[1:59:57] ordained to come that
[1:59:59] way and the water just closed right you
[2:00:02] know what that was a type of don't you
[2:00:04] that was a type of the blood of Jesus
[2:00:05] Christ the Red Sea it was showing you
[2:00:09] and I that the things that once hounded
[2:00:12] you and wanted to bring you back in
[2:00:14] bondage if you'll ever come God's
[2:00:16] provided way God will take care of every
[2:00:19] habit he'll take care of every situation
[2:00:22] he'll take care of everything that's
[2:00:24] there to where there's never a
[2:00:26] Taskmaster to come back over your life
[2:00:28] and say aha I've got you again the blood
[2:00:30] of Jesus Christ is there to handle and
[2:00:34] take care of
[2:00:37] sin and so with that in mind
[2:00:41] update relationship status changed
[2:00:45] because I know a lot of people like that
[2:00:46] status changed I wonder who it is my mom
[2:00:53] or if it's a daughter my
[2:00:54] dad that's who it
[2:00:57] is but an update a Rel relationship see
[2:01:00] this is what brings
[2:01:03] boldness see men and women can speak
[2:01:05] boldly Maybe by their Seminary teachings
[2:01:09] their teachings they've went through but
[2:01:10] that's not the boldness that comes from
[2:01:12] God we're talking about a boldness that
[2:01:14] will stand upon God's
[2:01:16] word regardless a boldness that will
[2:01:19] stand there and humble themselves to the
[2:01:21] word word of God no matter what yes amen
[2:01:25] this is where Paul could could bring us
[2:01:27] to this place and say the life that I
[2:01:29] now live I love the scripture I now live
[2:01:32] by the faith of the Son of God who loved
[2:01:34] me and gave himself for me don't you
[2:01:39] love him let me look look at what this
[2:01:41] Faith does here I'm closing brother Bram
[2:01:44] says oh look read with me and bold God
[2:01:46] that they would be so filled with your
[2:01:48] spirit that they'll have faith to
[2:01:50] perform miracles Faith to live a Godly
[2:01:54] life to live a life so
[2:01:57] sweet that when they are spoke evil of
[2:02:00] they speak not back evil that's
[2:02:05] faith that they can return a kiss for a
[2:02:09] slap that they can return good for evil
[2:02:12] granted Lord make men to be humble make
[2:02:16] men to come to know you in the power of
[2:02:18] your
[2:02:19] Resurrection May your death not be in
[2:02:22] vain to us in this
[2:02:26] generation let me just move ahead here
[2:02:29] it brings us to this place where the
[2:02:31] love of God produces a real genuine
[2:02:33] faith in our life a
[2:02:35] confidence because a confidence is is a
[2:02:38] trust how many know I'm talking about a
[2:02:41] trust you got a situation maybe there's
[2:02:43] a physical need that's come up and we're
[2:02:45] praying for
[2:02:46] it and and the whole thing about it is
[2:02:48] is it's not us that tells God how right
[2:02:51] it's going to
[2:02:53] happen it it's not us that does that
[2:02:56] well my faith no remember healing
[2:02:59] healing is of god brother Bram said
[2:03:02] whatever Avenue it comes through right
[2:03:05] it's all of God is that right I know
[2:03:08] sometimes we you know I know sometimes
[2:03:09] we there's certain things we don't want
[2:03:10] to go through I get it I I I understand
[2:03:12] that maybe I haven't been through what
[2:03:13] you but I I know I know inconveniences I
[2:03:15] also know it's not just inconvenience I
[2:03:17] I hear that with things you know from my
[2:03:19] dad and where he was I I don't know it
[2:03:21] much myself maybe personally but I I've
[2:03:23] been there with those things as far as
[2:03:24] to hear it I I I have empathy not a
[2:03:27] sympathy that I could say I've been
[2:03:28] there so I'll be real on
[2:03:30] that but it's not as though it's us that
[2:03:35] makes that determination but I'll tell
[2:03:37] you this we're standing on God's word
[2:03:39] where it says they shall lay hands on
[2:03:41] the sick and they shall recover is that
[2:03:44] right whether it's by medicine whether
[2:03:46] it's by surgery whether it God just
[2:03:49] there's a miracle that takes place in
[2:03:51] that one
[2:03:52] or it's a miracle just drops down and
[2:03:54] it's gone from our body however brother
[2:03:56] BR says God performs Miracles through
[2:03:58] surgeries yes I there's a lot within it
[2:04:03] you know it stabilizes us to let us see
[2:04:05] within that but the love of God is what
[2:04:07] brings us confidence to where when I
[2:04:08] don't know how it's all going to work
[2:04:09] out I've got to trust in
[2:04:12] him how many know what I'm talking about
[2:04:14] on that say trust I don't know I don't
[2:04:16] understand I'm just trusting you Lord
[2:04:19] see how did that how is that confidence
[2:04:20] by the faith of him him cuz it's
[2:04:22] actually a Marvel and a miracle to you
[2:04:24] that how you can have such a confidence
[2:04:26] remember you didn't give yourself that
[2:04:28] confidence it's because of him it's his
[2:04:32] faith moving in your life it's
[2:04:34] supernatural than Lord I don't know
[2:04:37] about you but that that to me is I
[2:04:39] rejoice in that quite a
[2:04:41] bit but here's where it comes over the
[2:04:43] love of God that we may have herein is
[2:04:46] our love made perfect that we may have
[2:04:49] boldness in the day of judgment because
[2:04:52] as he is so are we in this world there
[2:04:57] is no fear in love I'm not afraid of oh
[2:05:01] I'm afraid I'll backslide I'm afraid no
[2:05:04] let let God drive that out of your life
[2:05:06] let let let listen go back to that first
[2:05:08] verse let the love be made perfect amen
[2:05:13] that's let it be made complete that's
[2:05:16] good because fear has
[2:05:19] torment sickness all the other things it
[2:05:21] has tor torment things that torment
[2:05:23] right and that's all satan That's what
[2:05:25] Satan even likes to do if he can try to
[2:05:27] get between you and somebody else and
[2:05:29] get something in your life and even even
[2:05:31] put you in a trap and then you know what
[2:05:33] he'll do when that trap that that that
[2:05:36] he has set and you have fallen in
[2:05:39] then if you can recognize it there is
[2:05:42] one here to break the hold of that
[2:05:46] trap are you hearing me this morning I I
[2:05:48] know I'm gone a little longer but
[2:05:50] there's one to break that trap because
[2:05:52] that trap produces a torment around your
[2:05:54] life but there's a spirit of God to come
[2:05:57] and break that what do I have to do
[2:06:00] confess your
[2:06:03] sins don't make it don't don't make
[2:06:05] listen friends don't make excuses for
[2:06:08] sin well because I was a little boy back
[2:06:10] here or because so no that's not
[2:06:13] repentance repentance is I'm
[2:06:16] owning my actions by the
[2:06:20] influence I came under and it ain't the
[2:06:22] influence of somebody else it's the what
[2:06:24] allowed the enemy to influence me are
[2:06:28] you with
[2:06:29] me oh come on this is where the love of
[2:06:32] God comes into our hearts I want you to
[2:06:35] think of this as we come to to the
[2:06:37] communion before we take it I want to
[2:06:39] read this this quote to
[2:06:41] you brother Bram says you don't take the
[2:06:44] Lord's Supper as we would come here in a
[2:06:46] few moments we don't take the Lord's
[2:06:47] Supper by a tradition in other words
[2:06:49] well that's just what we do right we
[2:06:51] don't do it that way you take it because
[2:06:55] it's the love of God in your heart in
[2:06:57] keeping the Commandments of God that's
[2:07:00] what you take it
[2:07:01] for so if you don't take it in sincerity
[2:07:04] and it's just a tradition well our
[2:07:06] church observes communion once every
[2:07:08] Sunday or once every month or twice a
[2:07:10] year and you go up and say well it's my
[2:07:13] time and then take the communion then
[2:07:17] it's a stinct to God it's just a
[2:07:19] tradition
[2:07:22] even like anything else you've got to be
[2:07:25] sincere God wants the depth of your
[2:07:29] heart you remember the very God that
[2:07:32] brought you here on Earth is the one
[2:07:34] you're serving you're doing this because
[2:07:36] he said so because it's his order then
[2:07:39] we want to come up with the deepest
[2:07:41] sincerity knowing that by God's grace
[2:07:44] that we have been saved we love him we
[2:07:48] feel his presence and we see it change
[2:07:51] our Our lives our whole being is changed
[2:07:55] we're different people we don't live
[2:07:58] like we used to we don't think like we
[2:08:01] used
[2:08:03] to that's how we come to take communion
[2:08:05] we're thankful for what the God God's
[2:08:08] Grace has done in our life because this
[2:08:10] communion what it speaks of is I am a
[2:08:12] partaker of the word and the
[2:08:16] spirit my life with the word and the
[2:08:20] spirit I am I am a partaker except you
[2:08:22] eat the Flesh of the son of man and
[2:08:23] drink his blood you have no life in you
[2:08:25] I am a partaker of his life amen my sins
[2:08:30] are confessed and under the blood my
[2:08:33] life is hidden with God is hidden with
[2:08:37] Christ in God that that's where I'm
[2:08:38] standing I'm standing with him and
[2:08:41] that's why when we come we come to take
[2:08:43] this we we hear we do it a few times out
[2:08:46] of the year but when we come I you know
[2:08:49] and and I say this because I know we're
[2:08:51] living living in a a community all
[2:08:53] around it's such a um such a highly uh
[2:08:58] um heavily populated Catholic community
[2:09:02] and it it it's almost like coming out of
[2:09:06] Catholicism and then wanting to bring
[2:09:08] that that tradition over to here as
[2:09:10] though I have to do this if I don't if I
[2:09:12] don't do this then I'm not
[2:09:14] saved this is
[2:09:17] showing that you have fellowship with
[2:09:20] God
[2:09:22] right the Bible says we'll read in a few
[2:09:25] minutes you do this in remembrance of me
[2:09:29] right and that remembrance is where I
[2:09:31] just read to you at the end of what he
[2:09:34] did for me he is my way
[2:09:38] maker I have seen him come and change my
[2:09:43] life yes sir and you know we can
[2:09:46] Fellowship on this because many of us
[2:09:48] God changed our life and then he has to
[2:09:50] then he comes back around and makes
[2:09:51] known to us what he already did and we
[2:09:55] we could have been looking for this and
[2:09:56] looking for this to happen I had to have
[2:09:58] this happen that I feel this or did I do
[2:10:00] this and God comes right back around and
[2:10:01] he brings it and he what does he do
[2:10:03] positions us on his word this is what
[2:10:05] I've already done in your life and it's
[2:10:07] discerned you discern it by the
[2:10:11] word because that's your Solid Ground
[2:10:13] that's where you stand with boldness
[2:10:15] because if it's by feelings you can feel
[2:10:16] a different way tomorrow right feelings
[2:10:18] can go that's why our boldness tomorrow
[2:10:20] is not based on our feelings our
[2:10:22] boldness is based on I know where I
[2:10:23] stand with God I know that I have met
[2:10:26] God's requirements I know what he's done
[2:10:28] in my life and I know what he's doing in
[2:10:29] my life and the enemy can sit there and
[2:10:31] say yeah but you made a mistake last
[2:10:33] week but that has been confessed amen
[2:10:36] I'm not making no excuse for it it has
[2:10:38] been
[2:10:39] confessed because the Judgment seat of
[2:10:42] Christ has moved into my heart and my
[2:10:44] sins are taken
[2:10:46] daily is that right you love
[2:10:49] him my my
[2:10:51] I know I've been a little longer but hey
[2:10:53] sometimes we set a little bit longer at
[2:10:55] other events that offer no spiritual
[2:10:58] value whatsoever I'm not trying to
[2:11:01] condemn you I'm just trying to let you
[2:11:02] know that there's things within this
[2:11:04] this is the greatest value of our life
[2:11:07] and if this right here it'll give us a
[2:11:08] strength it'll give us a conviction you
[2:11:10] know it'll give you a conviction even
[2:11:11] when it comes to your family it'll give
[2:11:13] you conviction to where you won't allow
[2:11:14] the devil to put you in a corner and say
[2:11:16] well this is just my child this is just
[2:11:18] our children this is my no it gives you
[2:11:20] a conviction it'll give you wisdom
[2:11:22] listen it will not make you a dictator
[2:11:23] but it will give you the wisdom of God
[2:11:25] not to back up on the message of the
[2:11:28] hour that God will give you the wisdom
[2:11:30] on how to apply it everybody hear what
[2:11:31] I'm saying it gives you the wisdom and
[2:11:33] this is why looking to God there are
[2:11:35] many times Noah had to know how do I cut
[2:11:37] this board there's things in your life
[2:11:39] that you need to know and say God how do
[2:11:41] how do I shake this board how do I do
[2:11:43] this how do I do that you what it is
[2:11:45] there's a desire in your heart to see
[2:11:46] the word applied and you're looking for
[2:11:48] the wisdom of God to drop down in your
[2:11:50] life to where you're a able to stand
[2:11:51] there with a real courage and when you
[2:11:53] stand with a real courage it's covered
[2:11:55] with love and there's an atmosphere
[2:11:57] that's created like the prophet said
[2:11:59] that they fall right into that
[2:12:01] atmosphere you love him oh

[2:15:18] confession Lord where that sin would be
[2:15:21] so broken
[2:15:23] up by the blood of Jesus Christ Lord
[2:15:25] it's not something that's hard or
[2:15:28] complex it's
[2:15:30] simply a thorough your Prophet called it

[2:15:34] repentance completely Letting Go Lord

[2:17:02] that something Lord that in our lives
[2:17:06] that is to look upon daily because we
[2:17:09] never know Lord we do not know the day
[2:17:11] nor the hour your Prophet told us it's

[2:17:30] some that are not able to be here may
[2:17:33] your presence just move right down lord
[2:17:34] I pray right now dear God I believe with
[2:17:38] all of my
[2:17:40] heart father there was a young man that
[2:17:44] had been refused
[2:17:46] communion and he had Lord developed
[2:17:49] tuberculosis
[2:17:52] your Prophet was led by the spirit of
[2:17:55] God to go and take him
[2:17:58] communion and the prophet tells us he
[2:18:00] was refused
[2:18:02] it as a young
[2:18:04] man and tuberculosis developed in his
[2:18:09] body but he went there and he ministered
[2:18:12] communion to that
[2:18:15] boy Lord Jesus the Same Angel of the
[2:18:19] Lord that came to Peter in that prison
[2:18:22] that night the same Angel of the Lord
[2:18:26] healed that young man
[2:18:30] completely and he walked out of that
[2:18:32] iron
[2:18:33] lung Lord here today we don't hear too
[2:18:35] much about tuberculosis but back then it
[2:18:38] was like a death
[2:18:40] sentence Lord
[2:18:43] God when we read back in the Passover
[2:18:46] that was taken when they that was the
[2:18:48] last meal that they ate before they
[2:18:51] left
[2:18:54] Egypt Lord you kept every one of them
[2:18:56] alive you kept them you watched over
[2:18:58] them Lord you healed them you touched
[2:19:01] them Lord the Bible said there the
[2:19:03] threads of their clothes or their shoes
[2:19:05] never wore
[2:19:07] out oh God I pray granted Lord we know
[2:19:12] that that was speaking Lord of that real
[2:19:14] communion that we have with you
[2:19:16] Lord father where your presence comes
[2:19:19] down Our Lives has changed the
[2:19:23] experience of God in our life never
[2:19:25] wears out
[2:19:27] Lord help us Lord to
[2:19:30] pray we commit Lord this moment this
[2:19:34] time this service into your hands Lord
[2:19:37] for every need Lord in the name of Jesus
[2:19:42] Christ amen would you stand with me and
[2:19:45] let's read 1 Corinthians 11
[2:19:54] 1 Corinthians 11:23 maybe Brianna maybe
[2:19:57] you can bring that up verse 23 of 1
[2:19:59] Corinthians
[2:20:03] [Music]
[2:20:09] 11 Paul said for I have received of the
[2:20:14] Lord that which also I delivered unto
[2:20:17] you that the Lord Jesus the same night
[2:20:20] in which he was betrayed took bread and
[2:20:22] when he had given thanks he broke it and
[2:20:24] said take eat this is my body which is
[2:20:28] broken for you this do in remembrance of
[2:20:32] me and after the same manner also he
[2:20:35] took the cup when he had s saying this
[2:20:38] cup is the New Testament in my blood
[2:20:40] this do you as of as you drink it in
[2:20:44] remembrance of me for as often as you
[2:20:47] eat this bread and drink this cup you do
[2:20:50] sh the Lord's death till he come
[2:20:53] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[2:20:55] and drink this cup of the Lord
[2:20:57] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[2:21:00] and blood of the Lord but let a man
[2:21:03] examine himself and so let him eat of
[2:21:06] that bread and drink of that cup what a
[2:21:09] privilege friends what a privilege to be
[2:21:12] able to examine our own
[2:21:14] lives I don't know about you I I want to
[2:21:17] be judged by the word I I want to be
[2:21:19] judged I want to be judged I want my
[2:21:22] life you know why right
[2:21:24] now if there's a Purgatory which the
[2:21:26] only real Purgatory there is is what's
[2:21:28] happening right now to allow the word of
[2:21:30] God to purge sin out of our life allow
[2:21:33] the word to wash away sin and all
[2:21:35] unbelief to be able to examine Our Lives
[2:21:40] verse 29 for he that eateth and drinketh
[2:21:43] unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation
[2:21:46] to himself not Discerning the Lord's
[2:21:49] body
[2:21:51] that's just someone just living any old
[2:21:53] kind of
[2:21:55] life not taking into account of
[2:22:00] anything but we want to discern the
[2:22:02] Lord's body who is the Lord's body look
[2:22:05] around look
[2:22:07] around this is the Lord's Body by his
[2:22:12] spirit for this cause many are SI weak
[2:22:15] and sickly among you and many sleep for
[2:22:18] if we would judge ourselves we should
[2:22:19] not be judged but when we are judged we
[2:22:22] are chastened of the Lord that we should
[2:22:24] not be condemned with the world
[2:22:27] wherefore my brother when you come
[2:22:28] together to eat carry one for
[2:22:36] another I just say it like this I love
[2:22:38] you
[2:22:39] all if there's something I've said if
[2:22:42] it's the word I'll stand on the
[2:22:44] word but if there's anything I've done
[2:22:47] to offend any of you outside of that
[2:22:49] forgive me
[2:22:51] I don't say that
[2:22:55] lightly if you feel I have done wrong
[2:22:58] then you owe it to come to me and sit
[2:23:01] down with me over the
[2:23:04] word but for one another we're a
[2:23:08] body we're a body God don't want
[2:23:11] divisions he don't want schisms in the
[2:23:13] body this is why even in this moment
[2:23:15] such a sacred moment to remember this
[2:23:18] started out as one bread
[2:23:21] the brothers and I stood there in the
[2:23:23] back and we took of that bread and begin
[2:23:25] to break
[2:23:27] it because he was broken for you and
[2:23:30] [Music]
[2:23:34] I but you know what we're one
[2:23:36] bread we're one
[2:23:41] body even though this right here we've
[2:23:43] got a tray of many different cups but it
[2:23:45] came out of one one on the day of
[2:23:47] Pentecost there were 120 vessels but it
[2:23:49] came out of one one is that
[2:23:53] [Music]
[2:23:54] right The Same Spirit what a privilege
[2:23:58] it is to me what a privilege it is to be
[2:24:00] able to take communion
[2:24:02] together foot washing what a
[2:24:05] privilege that I believe one of these
[2:24:08] days we're going to walk down the
[2:24:10] streets of gold together Hall the toils
[2:24:13] of this road will seem nothing when we
[2:24:16] get to the end of the
[2:24:18] way it'll be worth it all
[2:24:22] amen Brothers brother Gomez Brother

[2:24:42] going to we're going to pray over the
[2:24:44] bread and over the wine and maybe just

[2:25:22] become one of us the word was made flesh
[2:25:26] and dwelt Among
[2:25:28] Us where you could say that Moses gave
