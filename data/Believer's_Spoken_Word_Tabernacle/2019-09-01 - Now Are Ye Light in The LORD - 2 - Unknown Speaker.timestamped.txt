[43:28] this morning into the service amen amen
[43:36] what a wonderful what a wonderful
[43:39] decision Amen that has been made Amen
[43:43] god bless you Jonathan
[43:44] Amen I also want if I'll try to send out
[43:50] a link here this this coming week here
[43:55] for deceiving perhaps and it will be a
[43:59] link for a service that was over there
[44:02] and brother Paula Fontaine their 30th
[44:05] anniversary that they had I was able to
[44:09] make it over for yesterday morning and
[44:12] then come back and I was so glad that I
[44:15] didn't know who was gonna be speaking
[44:17] and it really didn't matter to me there
[44:20] are friends and different ones I wanted
[44:22] to see and things and support the
[44:23] meeting but brother the reason I want to
[44:26] send you the link for tomorrow for for
[44:28] Saturday morning's message it's because
[44:30] brother Eli and I hope I get the name
[44:32] pronounced brother Eli Ortiz Ortez Ortiz
[44:36] was one of those he spoke and brother
[44:39] Eli is the one who has been over the
[44:43] Spanish translation project where we've
[44:47] received the announcements our our part
[44:50] of it here with assembly has been the
[44:53] supporting of the printing of those
[44:56] books once they've been translated and
[44:59] now once they've been translated they
[45:01] just don't go into print but they go up
[45:04] onto the message hub but then there's
[45:07] also the program that another brother
[45:10] had created that where the ministers are
[45:13] able to go into and anybody can download
[45:17] and search the message
[45:21] brother brother Eli goes into this
[45:24] within brother Eli came into to oversee
[45:27] this within and the translators and
[45:31] you'll hear one of the sisters who just
[45:35] just turning out the books about ten
[45:37] books a month and you know it he goes
[45:41] through all the opposition and things
[45:43] that people were saying and all of this
[45:45] but what you what I want you to would
[45:46] like you to look at as an assembly is
[45:48] that you see how that God has moved
[45:52] where there was such a small capacity
[45:57] that was translated over sixty years and
[46:00] within five years the entire Spanish
[46:04] language is translated entirely and so
[46:15] that right there either says I'm glad I
[46:18] was here this morning because that was
[46:21] exciting to me Amen that that this and
[46:25] that the the message that that I so
[46:29] enjoy is now available and out there in
[46:32] the hands of of the Brethren and you'll
[46:35] hear I just would encourage you to to
[46:40] take in what brother Eli's saying
[46:41] because it's just tremendous what God
[46:45] has been able what he's accomplished
[46:48] through it all so if I sit here and talk
[46:50] about it you won't even listen tonight
[46:51] but I just believe you'll be encouraged
[46:53] within it I also want to say I just had
[46:57] when I was over there and I wanted was
[47:00] gonna go wanted to go and see brother
[47:03] John LaFontaine in the hospital I I just
[47:05] thought you know he's in the hospital
[47:07] wanna go see he he was getting out of
[47:11] the hospital when we were coming out of
[47:13] the service
[47:15] and it just has had where they're gonna
[47:17] put a stent in his kidney because there
[47:20] was some blockage that was there and
[47:22] brother John this is the first time but
[47:24] Carlos it was the first time brother
[47:25] John's ever been in a hospital ever
[47:28] stayed overnight in a hospital so you
[47:31] know you can have a lot of entering in
[47:33] in prayer even for that and because that
[47:35] was something that was entirely
[47:36] different for brother John so I text him
[47:39] here early this morning and just just
[47:41] greeted him let him know we're just
[47:43] we're standing with him and prayer we
[47:45] certainly love and appreciate him the
[47:47] sister Loretta very much and with that
[47:50] being said I want you to remember to
[47:54] take note and the card that we have out
[47:58] there for brother John the fontaine
[48:00] we're going to be sending that here and
[48:02] if you have not wrote a note or some
[48:05] form of encouragement there to brother
[48:10] John how his ministry how its touched
[48:12] you how it has been a blessing to you I
[48:15] would ask you if you would please do
[48:18] that you don't know what an
[48:20] encouragement that is greater than all
[48:22] the medicine that could be out there and
[48:26] you know it's it's it's a part within us
[48:29] I don't want to preach on these things
[48:31] right now because it could but I just
[48:34] trust that you'll just take that right
[48:36] right a little something you don't have
[48:38] to write a novel
[48:41] just just share something if you feel
[48:44] like you need to type it up type it up
[48:46] okay and then just just send it send it
[48:49] to us and we'll get it to brother John
[48:51] would that be okay there's about three
[48:54] of you said Amen well we want to look
[49:02] here in the word for a few moments and I
[49:05] want to looking at this thought there's
[49:08] many things here within the Word of God
[49:10] that just things you know continue to
[49:14] build but there's these the parts that
[49:16] continue to really what's pressing on my
[49:19] heart within this of the word is that
[49:24] our lives would be our lives completely
[49:27] every heart every life my burden for
[49:30] this assembly is every life is fully
[49:33] surrendered and fully filled with the
[49:36] Holy Ghost that's my burden that's
[49:39] always been my labor but it's just
[49:41] something that's just so so within this
[49:44] this is even a part where things that
[49:47] we've been looking at in the Holy Spirit
[49:48] just inspiring it and remember this is
[49:51] not a man's pathway it is God's Way he
[49:58] promised David under inspiration of the
[50:01] Holy Spirit in one of the Psalms that
[50:03] pertained to the resurrection of the
[50:06] Lord Jesus Christ David spoke by the
[50:09] Spirit of God and said he shall make
[50:12] known unto me the paths of life and we
[50:16] understand that that path of life
[50:18] there's not just and there's not
[50:19] multiple paths but there is one God
[50:23] Himself came down when the way had been
[50:28] blocked off because of sin the
[50:31] fellowship was interrupted the man and
[50:35] was was removed from the garden from the
[50:38] what God had created and desired and
[50:42] placed man to be and yet when man could
[50:45] not get back into there God came to man
[50:50] and he said I am the way the truth and
[50:54] the life
[50:55] he became me that I might become him
[51:00] amen to come back into that fellowship
[51:02] as sons and daughters of God again and
[51:07] so when we look at this in the scripture
[51:11] in Ephesians 5 as we we recognize we're
[51:15] talking about light and we're not
[51:18] talking of this natural light that's
[51:21] only a type of the spiritual light with
[51:24] the spiritual light is God's own life
[51:28] and so when we recognize that within
[51:33] this the scripture says you were
[51:35] sometimes darkness you weren't just in
[51:38] darkness we were darkness but now are ye
[51:46] light in the Lord
[51:49] not just in the light but you are light
[51:54] we don't just want to be around like
[51:57] that's that's very that's me for but in
[52:01] order the whole objective is that we
[52:04] would become light in the Lord that our
[52:08] lives would reflect that same life so
[52:15] notice verse 14 where we read from that
[52:17] wherefore he say it so here he's
[52:20] speaking his word he's speaking awake
[52:24] thou that sleepest he is the only one
[52:27] that can raise from the dead and
[52:32] remember when they went to the tomb of
[52:35] Lazarus he told the disciples he's
[52:38] sleeping they didn't understand what
[52:41] he's talking about they thought he's
[52:42] confused
[52:43] but Jesus said so that you understand it
[52:47] he's dead but I'm going to wake him so
[52:55] when the Lord Jesus even in speaking of
[52:57] this verse arise from the dead he
[53:01] is calling what has laid within that
[53:05] life in a dormant dead state but now
[53:10] he's calling that to life that belongs
[53:14] to him and there's only one that can
[53:17] bring this this seed this reality to
[53:21] life in us and that is by the spoken
[53:25] word of Almighty God
[53:27] it takes God who knows his own to call
[53:32] for his own my and this is the promise
[53:37] notice arise from the dead self to be
[53:41] able it is a blessing he that hath an
[53:44] ear let him hear what the Spirit says to
[53:46] the churches it's a blessing to be able
[53:49] to hear his voice because been hearing
[53:54] his voice
[53:54] it gives direction to that inner man to
[53:59] rise from the dead and Christ shall give
[54:04] thee light
[54:05] it's a promise of life he will
[54:08] illuminate your life so now when we look
[54:12] here in the scriptures in Mathew chapter
[54:16] 6 verse 21 the Bible says it like this
[54:20] here is the Lord Jesus is speaking he
[54:22] says for where your treasure is there
[54:27] will your heart be also God doesn't come
[54:34] to deal with your head it wants your
[54:38] heart the message that God has sent
[54:41] never come to turn our heads but it came
[54:44] to turn our hearts
[54:49] for where your treasure is there will
[54:51] your heart be also notice the light of
[54:54] the body is the eye if therefore then I
[54:59] be single thy whole body shall be full
[55:03] of life but if thine eye be evil thy
[55:07] whole body shall be full of darkness and
[55:10] if therefore the light that is in thee
[55:14] be darkness how great is that darkness
[55:19] so it brings us to the reality is there
[55:23] a possibility that one could have
[55:27] so-called light within them but yet that
[55:31] light is darkness this scripture is
[55:35] speaking of the religion not God's not
[55:39] God's salvation this is speaking of
[55:43] man-made religion this is speaking of
[55:47] Satan's working because remember Satan
[55:51] has has even his own ministers that
[55:55] bring his own gospel Paul pulled it out
[55:57] and said they're not lazy they're
[55:59] workers they transform themselves into
[56:04] ministers of light but what does that
[56:07] light do it's a light that says you're
[56:09] okay God loves you you can stay as you
[56:13] are
[56:13] you know God understands and God under
[56:16] in other words what they're saying is
[56:18] God's weak God's puny God can't handle
[56:21] the situations in your life you know
[56:24] God's not able to do what he did before
[56:26] you know God understands this age is
[56:28] such an age where there's so much stuff
[56:30] that's available it that's a that's a
[56:32] gospel it lacks power but the original
[56:38] gospel of Jesus Christ it packs the same
[56:42] transforming power I don't care how
[56:47] wicked or how dark it has the ability to
[56:50] take a life and clean that life up and
[56:54] fill that life and make it a reflection
[56:57] just as he reflected himself through
[57:01] Peter through Paul through
[57:02] all of them through the messenger in
[57:04] this day that gospel has the power of
[57:07] God within it to bring a transformation
[57:10] in a life so we stand here this morning
[57:14] no compromise yes in your heart there's
[57:18] no compromise we don't have to
[57:21] compromise with sin you compromise once
[57:25] you'll be back at the peace table again
[57:27] making treaty talks again you can see
[57:30] that in the natural even over in the
[57:33] Middle East there's still having peace
[57:37] talks we want this settlement we want
[57:41] this settlement well this is not enough
[57:43] this is not enough let me tell you that
[57:45] devil is never satisfied but I can tell
[57:49] you this right here if you come to not
[57:52] just a table but the table of the Lord
[57:55] the altar of the Lord you come to the
[57:58] atonement and the sacrifice that was
[58:00] made for you brother there is a peace
[58:03] that it can be rendered into your heart
[58:07] will there'll never be any more talks
[58:10] anymore
[58:11] it becomes acetylene it becomes an
[58:16] absolute a remover of all doubts he is
[58:22] our peace who had broken down the middle
[58:25] wall of partition verse 24 what
[58:31] admonition no man what's how Jesus
[58:34] breaking this coming bringing this down
[58:37] a little further no man can serve two
[58:41] masters for either he will hate the one
[58:44] and love the other or else he will hold
[58:47] to the one and despise the other you
[58:50] cannot serve God and Mammon
[58:55] you can't balance it out you can't live
[58:58] between those two desires and be
[59:01] victorious you have a control tower in
[59:05] your body and you have a control tower
[59:07] in your soul
[59:08] each one has desires desires to satisfy
[59:12] the body the flesh and desire to satisfy
[59:14] the soul and brother Brahm tells us
[59:17] since 1965 in the message thirst he said
[59:20] too many people tried to live between
[59:24] those two desires but the only way that
[59:30] to come into victory and to gain victory
[59:33] is that the God who placed this desire
[59:37] within you that he is allowed and
[59:42] permitted to fully bring it to pass
[59:45] where it's no longer just a desire but
[59:49] now it becomes a living dwelling reality
[59:54] I do only those things which please the
[59:58] father I desire to please him above
[1:00:02] everything else see it takes him to
[1:00:06] bring that desire because you and I did
[1:00:09] not put that desire in us he put that
[1:00:12] desire and if you can only lonely look
[1:00:15] at it let God have his way he will bring
[1:00:19] to pass the word that he has sown in
[1:00:23] your life because you can't bring it to
[1:00:25] pass I can't bring it to pass but we can
[1:00:28] give ourselves over to the Living God
[1:00:32] oh and the Bible says what a fearful
[1:00:34] thing it is to fall into the hands of
[1:00:37] the Living God that were fearful means
[1:00:40] and all inspiring that which is a great
[1:00:44] a terrible not terrible in a bad way but
[1:00:48] terrible from that of the Old Testament
[1:00:50] it's all inspiring it's just it's beyond
[1:00:53] what our mind can can see what an
[1:00:56] awesome thing it is to fall into the
[1:01:00] hands of the Living God
[1:01:05] hallelujah no man can serve two masters
[1:01:09] for either he will hate the one and love
[1:01:12] the other else he will hold to the one
[1:01:14] and despise the other you cannot serve
[1:01:16] God and Mammon now when we look at this
[1:01:21] here Paul picks this up in verse in
[1:01:26] Philippians 2 verse 5 and here is the
[1:01:30] admonition that Paul by the Spirit would
[1:01:33] make sure the church let this mind be in
[1:01:35] you which was also in Christ Jesus he's
[1:01:40] not talking about this matter up here
[1:01:42] he's talking about that life who being
[1:01:48] in the form of God thought it not
[1:01:50] robbery to be equal with God but made
[1:01:54] himself I want you to catch this but
[1:01:57] made himself of no reputation and took
[1:02:01] upon him the form of a servant and was
[1:02:04] made in the likeness of men I want to
[1:02:09] say this clearly Jesus was not made to
[1:02:12] do what he did he did what he did
[1:02:16] because he was led by the Holy Ghost
[1:02:20] he was surrendered this is that what was
[1:02:25] lost in the fall there were glimpses of
[1:02:29] this through the prophets but now the
[1:02:32] glimpses was no longer a light here a
[1:02:35] light here a light here but now all of
[1:02:38] those lights had come together to be
[1:02:41] manifested in the Son of God that this
[1:02:47] is what that first Adam was and this is
[1:02:52] what every son and daughter of God is to
[1:02:56] be no repeat of God hallelujah he made
[1:03:03] himself how did he make himself he had
[1:03:06] listened he had the authority as a son
[1:03:10] of God but remember has the authority as
[1:03:13] a son of God he also received that
[1:03:18] of power Dunamis to operate in the
[1:03:21] position that God had ordained for him
[1:03:24] to operate in are you with me now so
[1:03:28] many times we're looking at as a
[1:03:29] physician as a son of God but remember
[1:03:32] to operate in that position you must
[1:03:34] have the life that is promised in order
[1:03:37] to operate that in our lives when Jesus
[1:03:40] said I have power that's exclusive I
[1:03:42] have power to lay my life down I have
[1:03:45] excuse your power to take it back up
[1:03:47] again and that word excuse here is right
[1:03:49] or authority are you with me but then
[1:03:54] there had to come that of do Toomas
[1:03:56] which is that power to bring to pass
[1:04:00] that which is right and authority a
[1:04:02] position it had to be brought to pass in
[1:04:05] his life the same way in our life we
[1:04:09] were always sons and daughters of God
[1:04:12] but it takes the Dunamis of God to bring
[1:04:16] in reality the authority that we would
[1:04:20] have as sons and daughters of God then
[1:04:23] it makes your worth then you operate as
[1:04:25] the son and daughter of God Adam said
[1:04:28] unless melton be plucked up moved over
[1:04:29] here you come on your job and say Lord
[1:04:32] you're the one that opened the door and
[1:04:36] this right here they're staring before
[1:04:37] me I don't know how you're gonna open
[1:04:39] this I don't know what's going to take
[1:04:40] place
[1:04:41] but I'm gonna look to you I could
[1:04:44] entertain the seaweed around my head I
[1:04:46] could entertain the smell of the vile
[1:04:48] vomit in that of the whale or I can look
[1:04:51] towards that Holy Temple a son of
[1:04:56] daughter of God taking Dominion and
[1:04:59] authority by the power of God that has
[1:05:03] positioned us as sons and daughters of
[1:05:06] God to say this is my Mountain
[1:05:10] [Applause]
[1:05:12] hallelujah glory be to God oh I love
[1:05:18] this and being found in fashion as a man
[1:05:21] he humbled himself and became obedient
[1:05:26] it is oh Lord I want you to humble me no
[1:05:29] you humble you how do you humble me we
[1:05:34] submit ourselves to the word it can go
[1:05:38] against the grain but when we humble
[1:05:40] ourselves to the word remember real
[1:05:42] power is humility I love the statement
[1:05:48] brother branham makes in humble thyself
[1:05:50] he says real humility I said for a
[1:05:54] person that's able to humble themselves
[1:05:57] yeah that person has more power and
[1:06:00] authority than the person who'll run all
[1:06:02] over the building the brand when talking
[1:06:05] about don't run all over the building
[1:06:06] you understand what he's saying he said
[1:06:08] because you have been able to conquer
[1:06:12] yourself he humbled himself and became
[1:06:18] obedient unto death even the death of
[1:06:21] the cross this of obedience
[1:06:24] there was a contending Hebrews v 7 tells
[1:06:27] us this there was a war that was going
[1:06:30] on in Gethsemane but the lamb prevailed
[1:06:37] Calvary was the manifestation of a
[1:06:41] battle that had already been won I'm
[1:06:44] telling you the Bible already declared
[1:06:47] in Revelation 13:8 the Lamb that was
[1:06:51] slain before the foundation of the world
[1:06:52] Isaiah picked up by the Spirit of God in
[1:06:55] Isaiah 53 he speaks of that offering of
[1:06:59] the lamb in a past tense measure he was
[1:07:03] bruised for our iniquity not something
[1:07:07] that shall be but what has already been
[1:07:11] but in order for that to take place
[1:07:13] notice nothing could hinder that or
[1:07:16] separate that even when those are the
[1:07:20] Pharisees and the mobs they wanted to
[1:07:23] lay hands on him and take the Lord Jesus
[1:07:25] but yet they could not do it until all
[1:07:29] had been fulfilled that was spoken of
[1:07:32] him it had to
[1:07:34] wait until timer fulfillment and let me
[1:07:36] say this to you as a son and daughter of
[1:07:38] God there is not one hair of your head
[1:07:41] can be touched without God permitting it
[1:07:45] and your life cannot be taken until it's
[1:07:48] finally fulfilled the purpose of
[1:07:51] Almighty God hallelujah
[1:07:55] you know what that brings out of us as
[1:07:57] believers Lord let me live every moment
[1:08:01] for your glory I want to hear him say it
[1:08:07] is well done my good and faithful
[1:08:11] servant enter into the joys that were
[1:08:15] prepared for thee before the foundation
[1:08:19] of the world he humbled himself well
[1:08:23] wasn't he already predestinated to this
[1:08:25] moment yes but he humbled himself and he
[1:08:28] became obedient so the word that was to
[1:08:32] be fulfilled has the sacrifice he came
[1:08:35] face to face with that and notice the
[1:08:38] working of the Holy Spirit in moving
[1:08:41] there in his life it brought him into
[1:08:45] complete subjection and expression of
[1:08:48] the word he was always in subjection to
[1:08:51] the word but for the word to be made
[1:08:54] manifest
[1:08:54] remember he prayed three times
[1:08:56] nevertheless not my will van will be
[1:08:59] done because why it was not a man come
[1:09:05] of God coming down in forcing man out of
[1:09:06] the Garden of Eden but it was man rather
[1:09:09] through deception had yielded there to
[1:09:13] the voice of the enemy and sin had
[1:09:15] entered so now in order for
[1:09:17] righteousness to enter there is one is
[1:09:20] the righteousness of God that would be
[1:09:23] yielded to the voice of God that
[1:09:25] righteousness then could now come to the
[1:09:29] believer and bring us under the blood
[1:09:32] not just a covering but a blood that's
[1:09:35] able to divorce and do away with sin
[1:09:40] we're not just talking about the blood
[1:09:43] what's to be under this blood
[1:09:47] oh my he humbled himself I always love
[1:09:52] the statements brother branham makes and
[1:09:54] total deliverance he said he could have
[1:09:56] been a man for he was man but he chose
[1:10:01] to surrender his natural parts to the
[1:10:06] spirit that dwelt in him he could have
[1:10:10] been a man you could choose to be a man
[1:10:13] or a woman you say that I could choose
[1:10:17] to be a man or woman let me in this
[1:10:19] environment maybe I need to correct that
[1:10:28] wait what would be is that you being a
[1:10:32] man God made you a man and that's what
[1:10:35] God intended you to be God didn't make
[1:10:38] an oops didn't make a mistake
[1:10:40] what made you a woman that's what he
[1:10:42] intended you to be now let me clarify
[1:10:44] that statement you can either live in
[1:10:48] your five senses down here or you can
[1:10:52] let God have preeminence in your life
[1:10:55] and bring out the expression of a son of
[1:10:59] God inside of the Brethren or a daughter
[1:11:02] of God in tyneside of the sisters you
[1:11:05] can surrender your life to him and let
[1:11:08] him live his own life manifest his own
[1:11:12] DNA through your life now this these
[1:11:21] statements here brother Branham will
[1:11:24] make and I've referred to these in
[1:11:26] multiple places and when you come into
[1:11:31] here in the message the Messiah brother
[1:11:34] Branham will in during this time here in
[1:11:39] in in in and then 61 but the brandman is
[1:11:43] moving in here and he is many he's given
[1:11:45] an example in multiple messages of when
[1:11:48] God would begin to work in a person's
[1:11:52] life it's like a little white button
[1:11:57] and that's when a man would get saved
[1:12:01] now remember when a man is saved you
[1:12:05] still have all his habits he's not born
[1:12:09] again yet but as stir as always habits
[1:12:16] but then there comes then the saint to
[1:12:20] find power of the one who draws him and
[1:12:25] that's the work of the Holy Ghost as
[1:12:28] well we're not talking about January 1st
[1:12:34] turning new leaves those don't work they
[1:12:38] don't work it's only going back to it
[1:12:42] we're not talking about a Linton that
[1:12:46] you do for a month we're talking about
[1:12:48] more than giving up Pepsi and chocolate
[1:12:52] if you permit me to say it we're talking
[1:12:56] about a real Lent Linton however you say
[1:12:59] it we're talking about a reality but
[1:13:01] it's not something that you're walking
[1:13:03] around and saying I can't do this but
[1:13:05] now if there is a change that comes on
[1:13:08] the inside that says I no longer want to
[1:13:13] do those things that's what we're
[1:13:18] talking about now the only way that'll
[1:13:23] come in the only way the Holy Spirit you
[1:13:26] see God dealing with alive for him to
[1:13:29] come in he's got to be welcomed he must
[1:13:32] be the one that starts dealing with the
[1:13:34] person now God can start dealing with
[1:13:37] the person before they ever start coming
[1:13:39] to church he can start dealing with
[1:13:42] their lives he can he can start you know
[1:13:44] dealing with their hearts and many times
[1:13:45] when we're praying for different needs
[1:13:47] there's a lot of times we could get
[1:13:50] discouraged because we seemingly are not
[1:13:52] seeing godlike results but remember
[1:13:57] Calvary was a manifestation of a battle
[1:14:01] one in Gethsemane
[1:14:04] and that battle was won there where the
[1:14:09] will was surrendered the only way this
[1:14:14] can come in is by self-will
[1:14:16] he cannot the only way that God can even
[1:14:19] move within a heart is myself will we
[1:14:23] have to allow him the Bible says he's
[1:14:26] standing in Revelations 3 he's standing
[1:14:28] on the outside of the door
[1:14:32] he's knocking
[1:14:35] is that right now we understand this
[1:14:37] he's put out of the church but also
[1:14:39] remember he knocks on the individual
[1:14:43] door forgive me I maybe don't have any
[1:14:52] other it just comes to me right now any
[1:14:54] other example but I I trust that you
[1:14:57] receive it sometimes you know it puts
[1:14:59] out in neighborhoods we got a in back in
[1:15:02] our neighborhood when we live we got
[1:15:03] signs and people ignore it says no
[1:15:06] solicitors allowed sometimes I want to
[1:15:11] take that sign and just put it in front
[1:15:13] of my door no solicitors allowed in my
[1:15:20] answer in red no but we all gotta have
[1:15:28] patience but notice this God he comes
[1:15:35] and he comes and knocks on your door it
[1:15:43] doesn't matter if a person is in a
[1:15:46] pigpen Jesus will go knock on their door
[1:15:50] Oh glory Jesus don't know well that's a
[1:15:57] bad neighborhood I ain't going down
[1:15:58] there Jesus don't know no bad
[1:16:00] neighborhoods amen this this life goes
[1:16:05] to those who sit in darkness hey man he
[1:16:11] says all I need to do is an if they open
[1:16:14] that door and they'll let me come in oh
[1:16:17] my I'll bring a change in their
[1:16:19] residency hallelujah and he's nothing
[1:16:26] now he's not he don't that Jesus don't
[1:16:28] have those big Rams you know them he
[1:16:32] didn't coming out SWAT team he's not
[1:16:36] studying the lock let me see honking
[1:16:37] kick this in that ain't Jesus
[1:16:40] remember he wants us to serve Him and is
[1:16:46] that right so now when God comes in to
[1:16:50] the man brother bran likens it to a
[1:16:51] little white button starting out and you
[1:16:54] know as we look at this in the scripture
[1:16:57] you know there first starts out with a
[1:17:00] believing knot and listen to me I
[1:17:02] understand that this is very simple but
[1:17:05] I don't want you to tune me out this is
[1:17:07] how the word comes for every need you
[1:17:12] first must believe brother Branham which
[1:17:20] that would have the time he would take
[1:17:23] ffs Bosworth and those other brethren
[1:17:25] and you say well we don't need their
[1:17:28] mother brethren we just need a brother
[1:17:29] Brandon become the platform that is not
[1:17:31] what brother Graham said as a matter of
[1:17:33] fact when you begin to look at that with
[1:17:35] FF Bosworth and you many times you read
[1:17:38] in his writings its word-for-word the
[1:17:40] things that brother Branham was
[1:17:42] declaring about hanging onto your
[1:17:44] healing because you must know your faith
[1:17:47] cannot be based on anything other than
[1:17:50] the Word of God because after the
[1:17:53] meeting is over with your faith has got
[1:17:58] to stand on that word and worship in
[1:18:00] that world and when symptoms trying to
[1:18:03] come back you stand there and say but
[1:18:05] God said I've got a right to this
[1:18:09] promise this belongs to me faith says it
[1:18:13] is mine how many times brother Branham
[1:18:17] will talk about oh if we could just have
[1:18:20] a tent set up here for weeks to teach
[1:18:23] the people
[1:18:27] that's Scripture the word is given for
[1:18:29] instruction in righteousness you have
[1:18:32] knowledge of what belongs to you is that
[1:18:35] right
[1:18:36] blue Graham talks about a woman who was
[1:18:38] healed but she started feeling all sorts
[1:18:41] of pains and discomfort symptoms start
[1:18:46] arising she goes ahead and gets the
[1:18:47] operation done they open her up find
[1:18:51] nothing the brem said see if she - only
[1:18:55] been taught how to hang on to it she was
[1:18:58] healed hello somebody
[1:19:01] she was healed oh my that's a whole
[1:19:08] separate message but it's a principle
[1:19:11] I said it's a principle our faith must
[1:19:15] be based on the Word of God not on
[1:19:19] shifting sands this is why Paul would
[1:19:21] say for I am not ashamed of the gospel
[1:19:23] of Christ
[1:19:25] the gospel not the word the gospel
[1:19:28] because now the word that had been
[1:19:30] spoken and been prophesied has now come
[1:19:34] to pass remember Paul preached the Sun
[1:19:37] down there and acts 19 where they knew
[1:19:40] that Jesus himself he was then indeed is
[1:19:44] the Christ is that right but Paul had to
[1:19:47] come to him and let him know he said
[1:19:50] have you received the Holy Ghost since
[1:19:53] you believed
[1:19:55] notice since you believed not when you
[1:20:00] believe when you believe listen in order
[1:20:04] to believe it takes a work of God your
[1:20:08] thinking changes concerning the Word of
[1:20:11] God your thinking a new heart will I
[1:20:15] give you
[1:20:16] Ezekiel 37 a new heart a new thinking
[1:20:19] towards the Word of God that's a work of
[1:20:22] the Holy Ghost but it's still not the
[1:20:25] person then it comes I will give you a
[1:20:29] new spirit which is a saint defying
[1:20:33] power of Almighty God and you feel
[1:20:37] listen listen to me now there is an
[1:20:39] experience when a person turns their
[1:20:42] heart over to God is that right
[1:20:45] you feel burdens lifted and yet a person
[1:20:48] can turn their heart over to God and
[1:20:50] hear what God has done which is a
[1:20:52] marvelous thing they still have
[1:20:54] cigarettes in their life they're still
[1:20:56] looking at all sorts of things on the
[1:20:57] internet they're still doing all these
[1:20:59] other types of things and yet they have
[1:21:02] believed
[1:21:04] new art and then I didn't experience my
[1:21:08] my sins you know it's like when you get
[1:21:10] up a burden has been lifted but as
[1:21:13] promised is also I'll give you a new
[1:21:16] spirit notice I will not you've got to
[1:21:20] go do this I'll do this they meant God
[1:21:24] let's just know I'll be the one that
[1:21:27] cleans up your life I come in there and
[1:21:33] I'll start kicking out the shorts I'll
[1:21:35] start taking out the paint off the face
[1:21:37] I'll start making your conduct and act
[1:21:40] yourself like a son and daughter go I'll
[1:21:42] take the earrings out of your ear I'll
[1:21:44] take the scissors out of your hand come
[1:21:47] on somebody they're talking about a
[1:21:49] safety bang power of Almighty God but
[1:21:54] God said I'll take the high heels off of
[1:21:56] you come on somebody
[1:21:59] God said I'll bring a transformation in
[1:22:02] your life I'll remove you from being a
[1:22:05] fornicator and an adulterer and I will
[1:22:08] change your life a new spirit will I
[1:22:14] give you what brother Samuel I only wear
[1:22:21] I only wear pants once in a while you
[1:22:24] first of all the question is have you
[1:22:26] even given your heart to God well I read
[1:22:29] the Bible ain't asking you about your
[1:22:31] religion God don't want your religion
[1:22:34] God don't want your traditions he don't
[1:22:38] want your idols I'm asking you have you
[1:22:41] given your heart to God to believe on
[1:22:44] him on what he did
[1:22:53] hallelujah listen friends if we want
[1:22:59] healing you got to stick with the
[1:23:01] prescription you got to stick with the
[1:23:05] prescription if you're going to get
[1:23:07] amoxicillin and you get that amoxicillin
[1:23:09] and it's generic but it's more than
[1:23:11] generic you don't pack within it the
[1:23:14] punch of that amoxicillin 875 milligrams
[1:23:18] you got something on the outside that
[1:23:20] says it got a punch like this on the
[1:23:22] inside of that pill but yet it don't
[1:23:24] have 875 milligrams it has been weakened
[1:23:28] you know what you will not recover but
[1:23:35] when the prescription Amen that eternal
[1:23:39] prescription is followed it'll bring the
[1:23:42] same results a man's sin has been
[1:23:46] diagnosed and yes diagnosed in every age
[1:23:49] and the prognosis is always the same
[1:23:54] Amen oh my for it is the power of God
[1:24:00] unto salvation to everyone that
[1:24:03] believeth to the Jew first and also to
[1:24:06] the Greek for therein is the
[1:24:09] righteousness of God revealed from faith
[1:24:11] to faith as it is written the just shall
[1:24:14] live by faith
[1:24:16] now notice Paul would go on in Romans 10
[1:24:20] and he would speak about calling upon
[1:24:25] the name of the Lord verse 13 for
[1:24:27] whosoever shall call upon the name of
[1:24:29] the Lord shall be saved how then shall
[1:24:34] they call on him in whom they have not
[1:24:37] believed and how shall they believe in
[1:24:41] him of whom they have not heard and how
[1:24:43] shall they hear without a preacher and
[1:24:46] how shall they preach except they be
[1:24:49] sent
[1:24:50] how beautiful are the feet of them that
[1:24:52] preach the gospel of peace and bring
[1:24:54] glad tidings of good things
[1:24:59] verse 13 of Ephesians one in whom ye
[1:25:03] also trusted after that you heard the
[1:25:06] word of truth
[1:25:07] somebody say after and whom you trusted
[1:25:11] after not when after that you heard the
[1:25:17] word of truth the gospel of your
[1:25:19] salvation
[1:25:23] you see let me back up here in a moment
[1:25:26] I just just feel pressed to back up this
[1:25:32] principle has said moments ago it
[1:25:36] applies to every promise of God this
[1:25:42] does not just apply for a person coming
[1:25:49] in to justification sanctification and
[1:25:52] the baptism of the Holy Ghost this
[1:25:55] remember the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:25:57] is where now the word has gained
[1:25:59] preeminence in your life but this is the
[1:26:02] same formula for every promise of God
[1:26:08] you say what do you mean by that that
[1:26:10] even the things that pertain to our
[1:26:13] lives whether it be healing it's things
[1:26:16] that pertain on how we live and walk in
[1:26:18] a daily life it must be a scriptural
[1:26:22] foundation if not we're only hoping it's
[1:26:31] only well I just found this out this
[1:26:32] I'll just say this and it'll be that's
[1:26:35] not how sons and daughters of God
[1:26:37] operate sons and daughters of God do not
[1:26:40] operate outside of the word are you with
[1:26:46] me so it always must be according the
[1:26:49] word so I say that just feeling pressed
[1:26:51] of the Lord to say that because
[1:26:53] sometimes the enemy will try to come in
[1:26:55] and say oh well this is a this is a
[1:26:57] foundational message be careful you're
[1:27:00] not saying that it's more than a
[1:27:03] foundational message after you've heard
[1:27:07] the word of truth there's got to be
[1:27:09] promises got our ministered to us or
[1:27:12] will never come to them God called
[1:27:15] Abraham out of the land
[1:27:17] did he not he made him promises that God
[1:27:20] rehearses and Genesis 12 right there in
[1:27:23] those three verses but God keeps
[1:27:25] preaching to Abraham they're right Paul
[1:27:29] picks it up in Galatians 3 he preached
[1:27:32] this gospel unto Abraham
[1:27:35] what did the preaching do it brought and
[1:27:37] there was an unfolding by God of what
[1:27:41] God had called and declared to come to
[1:27:44] pass in Abraham's life so Abraham would
[1:27:47] have his faith Abraham's faith wouldn't
[1:27:50] rest on the Word of God when Abraham in
[1:27:55] Genesis 18 is sitting in the door of his
[1:27:57] tent why is he sitting in the door of
[1:28:00] his tent
[1:28:01] well brother Simon he just loves to sit
[1:28:03] there in the door of his tent no no he's
[1:28:07] sitting in the door of his tent he's
[1:28:09] looking for somebody he's looking for
[1:28:14] his coming he's received a promise in
[1:28:18] Genesis 12 I will visit you courting
[1:28:23] within the next year I will visit Sarah
[1:28:26] he knows in order for this to happen
[1:28:29] there's got to be a visitation does he
[1:28:32] know how it's going to come no but he's
[1:28:35] expecting it to come faith is based on
[1:28:39] the Word of God in whom also after that
[1:28:47] ye believed you were sealed with the
[1:28:50] Holy Spirit a problem after that you
[1:28:51] believed after now you know what we
[1:28:58] spoke here just moments ago out of
[1:28:59] Matthew there's no room for two in your
[1:29:02] house
[1:29:06] nope ain't no room for two and Jesus
[1:29:09] ain't moving in Jesus will not move in
[1:29:13] and say you know what what cohabitate
[1:29:17] I'm greater than the devil I just moved
[1:29:19] in right there and that ain't how Jesus
[1:29:22] works Jesus said he's got to be gone
[1:29:28] he's gotta be gone or goats a mule
[1:29:34] I feel the blessings of the Lord sure
[1:29:38] sure you feel the blessings of the Lord
[1:29:41] but the real blessing is that he would
[1:29:45] dwell inside of you that this mind be in
[1:29:52] you that was in Christ Jesus
[1:29:58] see that's why the mind of Christ cannot
[1:30:00] be in a life and then life is still
[1:30:02] drinking and smoking cigarettes and
[1:30:03] looking at porn and everything else well
[1:30:07] I'm gonna preach it can't be because the
[1:30:12] Holy Ghost is not a filthy spirit he's
[1:30:15] the Holy Spirit now you understand God
[1:30:25] God is for you God is for us he's
[1:30:29] calling us to this hallelujah
[1:30:36] oh my you see somebody's got to move out
[1:30:46] well let me just say that comes my mind
[1:30:53] my wife and I we we sold our house we
[1:30:56] moved into this other house a couple
[1:30:57] years ago
[1:31:02] we get mail coming to that house from
[1:31:04] the people that live there still two
[1:31:07] years later sometimes it's some serious
[1:31:10] stuff I think it's serious stuff because
[1:31:13] they were all into the medical field and
[1:31:16] I look at things sometimes they've had
[1:31:18] deliveries and I know it was medicine
[1:31:20] fortunately the in-laws live down the
[1:31:22] street I just take it down there and put
[1:31:24] it in their door say what do you give
[1:31:28] that example for because there's mail
[1:31:31] that the mailman you know what he keeps
[1:31:32] reading 3909 Randolph try 3909 Randolph

[1:34:56] so the Holy Ghost coming in the Spirit
[1:35:00] of God God working in a life listen
[1:35:02] through that when a person would believe
[1:35:04] on the Lord Jesus Christ let me just say
[1:35:09] what what that means to believe on the
[1:35:11] Lord Jesus Christ it's to receive and
[1:35:16] accept his pardoning grace trevor you
[1:35:24] remember that in an hospital room that
[1:35:26] day when he came and spoke pardon in
[1:35:28] grace
[1:35:33] many of the recipe I remember when he
[1:35:35] came and he spoke pardon and Gracie let
[1:35:37] me know I went to Calvary for you you
[1:35:45] see what what you can do what I couldn't
[1:35:48] do he went and did for us so where is
[1:35:53] our faith our faith in is to be placed
[1:35:56] in him and don't take it back when God
[1:36:04] calls you and you repented of your sin
[1:36:07] that's part of the prescription you
[1:36:09] repent of your sin you recognize I am a
[1:36:12] transgression brother Samuel I've been
[1:36:14] raised in this message for all of my
[1:36:16] life will you need all the more to
[1:36:18] repent because you've been sitting
[1:36:20] around where I'll wear the right and the
[1:36:22] word of truth is you need to repent I
[1:36:25] don't care if you didn't go out of the
[1:36:27] world you need to repent when the
[1:36:33] Pharisees came to John the Baptist he
[1:36:35] said repent they looked himself in sin
[1:36:39] more
[1:36:47] they didn't realize and hear the word
[1:36:49] the kingdom of heaven is at hand it's a
[1:36:55] different Kingdom they didn't catch the
[1:37:00] change there was a transition going on
[1:37:04] and the word spoken by God
[1:37:08] was alerting them there is a change
[1:37:12] taking place oh my the brand would say
[1:37:18] like this is that if we can just let
[1:37:20] that spirit grow and take out all the
[1:37:22] roots of bitterness and press God's way
[1:37:25] through him again he can be come back in
[1:37:29] the condition that he was was when he
[1:37:31] was in the Garden of Eden oh he sent it
[1:37:34] and we can let this cosmic light because
[1:37:35] you know we have light in these natural
[1:37:38] bodies right that's how they get x-rays
[1:37:41] but if we can let this cosmic light look
[1:37:44] what he says that it could be pushed to
[1:37:47] a place to where it's not cosmic light
[1:37:50] but it's eternal light where God could
[1:37:54] dwell supremely to do our thinking do
[1:37:58] our walking you are talking then it's no
[1:38:02] longer the man it's God in the man
[1:38:07] another Samuel is that possible oh it's
[1:38:09] possible a man where God can dwell
[1:38:14] supremely they men now he's got light
[1:38:19] life eternal life is the light of God
[1:38:21] that dwells in the man and if he I love
[1:38:23] this if he will yield to the spirit more
[1:38:27] he becomes unmanned sinner like and
[1:38:30] becomes more godlike if he can what you
[1:38:38] you but God is calling for you you just
[1:38:42] let God deals with the heart makes known
[1:38:46] the realities of Calvary there's an
[1:38:49] atonement there's one who suffered you
[1:38:52] walk in that right there you yield to
[1:38:55] that here God comes moves within that
[1:38:58] life then God deals with that life one
[1:39:01] and cleaning it up and you're saying
[1:39:03] lord sanctify me Lord take these habits
[1:39:07] and all this Dominion of sin Lord take
[1:39:10] it out of my life what are you doing
[1:39:11] you're yielding you're yielding to him
[1:39:15] what does he do he comes and does what
[1:39:18] only he can do and then he says I'll put
[1:39:24] my spirit in you and I'll cause you to
[1:39:27] keep my word it won't be you anymore
[1:39:31] it'll be I in you you in me you'll stand
[1:39:40] at the amazement in your life because
[1:39:43] it's a paradox the mystery of me working
[1:39:46] in you that you can't even explain it
[1:39:51] but you're born of the Spirit of God and
[1:39:54] lack the wind you cannot tell from
[1:39:56] whence the wind cometh or whence it
[1:39:58] goeth these are the depths of God that
[1:40:04] God has called for Paul would express
[1:40:07] these depths of God and he would would
[1:40:10] pray in regards to the whole family
[1:40:13] in Ephesians 3
[1:40:17] he put Paul in verse 14 he would talk
[1:40:20] about and say for this calls I bow my
[1:40:24] knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus
[1:40:25] Christ of whom the whole family in
[1:40:27] heaven and earth is named that he would
[1:40:29] grant you according to the riches of his
[1:40:32] glory to be strengthened with might by
[1:40:36] his spirit in the inner man that Christ
[1:40:39] may dwell in your hearts by faith he
[1:40:44] meant that ye being rooted and grounded
[1:40:47] in love may be able to comprehend with
[1:40:50] All Saints what is the breadth length
[1:40:52] depth height and to know the love of
[1:40:55] Christ we heard about that on Thursday
[1:41:00] night which passeth knowledge then you
[1:41:07] might be filled with all the fullness of
[1:41:10] God bro Graham would take these
[1:41:17] scriptures here
[1:41:20] and if I'm not mistaken you I think you
[1:41:22] find even the heading in your Scofield
[1:41:24] Bible talks about the depths of God and
[1:41:27] brother Brown would label it that way
[1:41:28] the depths of God and to remember that
[1:41:33] there is a depths of Satan
[1:41:37] in the book of Proverbs you find in the
[1:41:42] book of Proverbs or her and as she
[1:41:44] mentioned but it depends on who the her
[1:41:48] is there's there's two there's two
[1:41:53] brides in the world there's God's bride
[1:41:56] Satan's bride that right one of them it
[1:42:00] says in the book of Proverbs her stairs
[1:42:04] are the way to hell her access her gates
[1:42:10] are the gates of hell but then it speaks
[1:42:14] I believe it's proverbs 7 in another
[1:42:15] place you'll find all that as you read
[1:42:17] in the book of Proverbs you'll find
[1:42:18] where it talks about her and it speaks
[1:42:20] of a woman and it's dealing with Christ
[1:42:23] dwelling in the bride of Jesus president
[1:42:26] says she hath builded a house and her
[1:42:29] house is built on seven pillars it meant
[1:42:35] it's a complete dwelling place that God
[1:42:38] might fully step in we're living in the
[1:42:42] hour where God had promised I will
[1:42:46] restore what was there on the day of
[1:42:50] Pentecost he's been working all the way
[1:42:53] through that seed of life had to go in
[1:42:56] the ground it went in the dirt come on
[1:42:59] now the dirt being the denomination's
[1:43:01] it went in there but remember that seed
[1:43:05] is a seed of the original life and he
[1:43:10] could not stay there it comes back into
[1:43:13] a place of complete full expression as
[1:43:16] it was there on the day of Pentecost so
[1:43:21] the promise of I will restore is where
[1:43:24] that God himself has laid it out this
[1:43:27] temple that he would build for his
[1:43:30] habitation God he could dwell in
[1:43:33] Luther's in Luther's ministry in
[1:43:36] justification he could dwell there in
[1:43:38] the inner life that believe by faith
[1:43:40] that debt that the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:43:43] suffered from me
[1:43:44] but remember Luther still drink and he
[1:43:48] still smoked
[1:43:50] but then more light came and here Wesley
[1:43:54] picks it up by inspiration of God had
[1:43:57] said there is a sanctifying power in the
[1:44:00] blood
[1:44:00] what is it more light is coming so now
[1:44:04] it's more light is coming what we find
[1:44:06] we find that of Luther plus more of God
[1:44:13] Wesley has had to yield he's yielded to
[1:44:16] that word
[1:44:17] now here comes to Pentecost faith being
[1:44:20] restored the gifts being restored what
[1:44:23] does it do it it's making way to believe
[1:44:26] in the supernatural
[1:44:27] because the new birth is supernatural is
[1:44:33] that right
[1:44:33] Mary left him at the feast of Pentecost
[1:44:37] they denied the virgin birth but now
[1:44:42] they must come back faith Mary type
[1:44:45] Pentecost there must come back faith in
[1:44:48] the supernatural
[1:44:49] for what reason for the new birth where
[1:44:54] the person of Christ can step fully into
[1:44:59] his bride and this is the finishing
[1:45:04] revelations 10-7 the finishing of the
[1:45:08] mystery of God she's bone of my bone
[1:45:14] flesh of my flesh
[1:45:16] laughs of my life there was little
[1:45:20] glimpses back there and justification
[1:45:22] and Luther's message the gesture Labov a
[1:45:24] oh it looks a little more and Saints
[1:45:26] back a little bit more it's like a
[1:45:28] picture you know with the Polaroid
[1:45:29] camera how many remember Polaroid
[1:45:31] cameras only five of you now remember
[1:45:36] Polaroid cameras where you take the
[1:45:38] picture and it comes out I remember my
[1:45:44] brother got one I thought it was the
[1:45:45] neatest thing in the world
[1:45:46] Oh was I here about five or something
[1:45:48] like that
[1:45:51] ma'am had been young I'm when I thought
[1:45:53] it was a neat he he ancestor mean a man
[1:45:58] they were popping in pictures and we
[1:45:59] were setting them on the coffee table
[1:46:06] we were watching here comes here comes
[1:46:13] it's coming more interview what that's
[1:46:17] exactly it's God coming more into view
[1:46:22] and the same way he's done it through
[1:46:27] the ages is the same way he does it in
[1:46:31] every son and daughter of God
[1:46:34] it is him coming into view he is the
[1:46:41] only one that is in bling hue
[1:46:47] what's happening Moses ray he's stepping
[1:46:51] forward we're stepping back he's
[1:46:54] increasing we are decreasing
[1:46:57] what's the decreasing it's us submitting
[1:47:00] to him and he's just stepping to the
[1:47:02] forefront and then the enemy comes
[1:47:05] around and wants to pick on us he wants
[1:47:09] to come he sees us and then we say
[1:47:13] my Big Brother's here my Big Brother's
[1:47:19] here the Lord Jesus Christ and he has to
[1:47:24] take notice to that life that token that
[1:47:30] blood that's on display that depth of
[1:47:36] God God's desire brother Branham would
[1:47:42] place it let me just read this statement
[1:47:44] when a man experiences the depth of God
[1:47:47] in his life it is an actual personal
[1:47:53] experience of the Spirit of God in
[1:47:56] dwelling and his mind is illuminated by
[1:48:02] the wisdom and knowledge of God through
[1:48:06] the word so what does it do it brings
[1:48:10] you this experience it brings you to the
[1:48:13] word all along it's calling you to him
[1:48:17] it's him working all along to bring us
[1:48:20] into that experience of the word and
[1:48:22] this is why Satan wants to substitute it
[1:48:27] he wants to substitute it he wants to
[1:48:30] belittle it he wants to make light of it
[1:48:32] he wants to give all other sorts of ways
[1:48:35] of well all you have to do is just just
[1:48:40] believe the message is the truth
[1:48:42] you've got to do more than that well all
[1:48:46] you got to do is come to a message
[1:48:47] church you got to do more than that well
[1:48:50] you got to do is believe that brother
[1:48:52] Graham is a prophet you got to do a lot
[1:48:54] more than that you have have to have an
[1:48:59] experience with Jesus Christ amen thank
[1:49:04] God for the experience of the new heart
[1:49:07] where you're thinking change thank God
[1:49:09] for the change of where he lifts their
[1:49:12] of sins hold and the habits of this
[1:49:15] world thank God for that that's a work
[1:49:16] of God but then that God might come and
[1:49:19] dwell it's all his work so when it's all
[1:49:22] said and done
[1:49:23] God could say you are my personal work
[1:49:29] my hands have formed you I have called
[1:49:35] you I have formed the I am thy Redeemer
[1:49:39] I have brought you to myself

[1:49:45] workmanship of a church you're my
[1:49:48] workmanship you're my signature addition
[1:49:57] you're an original creation you're not a
[1:50:01] reproduction you're not an impersonation

[1:51:54] more power you understand what I'm
[1:51:55] saying a horse and buggy it's it's got
[1:51:59] within it some power is that right but
[1:52:04] then when you get into a place of a car
[1:52:05] a car's got some more power to it right
[1:52:10] then from a car you go into an airplane
[1:52:12] that's got more power in it but the
[1:52:15] horse and buggy had power in it when you
[1:52:17] get to an astronaut a spaceship it's got
[1:52:20] a lot of power doing it
[1:52:21] I mean hey come on now you would think
[1:52:24] it's funny having somebody riding

[1:52:38] kind of power is built not just to sail
[1:52:42] around just a few thousand feet in there
[1:52:45] that kind of power was made to break
[1:52:48] gravity but there was an advancement of
[1:52:54] the power and that's the same way it is
[1:52:56] in your life there's an advancement of
[1:52:59] power when a person believes on the Lord

[1:57:37] it now had her image it had her complete
[1:57:45] picture and she was reading and looking
[1:57:53] at herself there have been a picture of
[1:57:58] her reproduced on what was filthy rags
[1:58:04] somebody brother David had to gather
[1:58:06] them filthy rags out of the street
[1:58:11] that's how God has gathered us he
[1:58:14] gathered us out of the streets some of
[1:58:21] us might have been more filthy than
[1:58:22] others but it didn't matter we all were
[1:58:25] still filthy but we were gathered into
[1:58:34] the place where the word becomes flesh
[1:58:41] we were gathered in a place of one who
[1:58:44] can take filthy rags and transform him
[1:58:49] and put his own image to where now he's
[1:58:55] having fellowship with his attributes
[1:58:59] his sons and daughters of God where the
[1:59:02] rest of the world said that ain't
[1:59:04] nothing but filth is it all but I know
[1:59:07] what's laying in them I bring him to
[1:59:11] myself I run him through my cleansing
[1:59:15] process and when I place my image on
[1:59:21] them
[1:59:27] the rags couldn't do it is that right
[1:59:31] but the rags you and me had to be
[1:59:36] willing to be picked up had to believe
[1:59:41] Lord that's what I want I want you I
[1:59:45] want that image on my life I got this I
[1:59:51] got that don't look at that look at him
[1:59:53] if you look at him what it is that
[1:59:56] you're looking at about giving up giving
[1:59:58] up this your focus will get off that and
[2:00:00] you receive power and that will move
[2:00:03] from your life you with me there
[2:00:06] sanctifying power in the Lord Jesus
[2:00:10] Christ as a matter of fact that's the
[2:00:11] only source I said that's the only
[2:00:13] source you said what'd I do stay under
[2:00:17] the way first of all sure into your
[2:00:19] heart to God if you haven't repent
[2:00:21] that's first and if you repent it then
[2:00:23] you stand upon that knowing that God you
[2:00:26] not dissing not just been an accident
[2:00:28] but God has called you for a purpose and
[2:00:32] that life that is drawn on you he wants
[2:00:35] to put his image on your life but son I
[2:00:40] can't do it but he can if you'll just
[2:00:43] yield to him he'll take you through the
[2:00:48] process
[2:00:50] and for those that stand as us have
[2:00:54] Mussa stand as witnesses of how he has
[2:00:56] taken us through the process he's still
[2:00:59] transforming us from glory unto glory
[2:01:05] hallelujah on the front page is that
[2:01:08] image but you know what when you read a
[2:01:11] newspaper what do you do you got to open
[2:01:13] it up and when you're reading the
[2:01:15] newspaper that on the front it still
[2:01:17] stands out to everybody but you're
[2:01:19] starting to read things that are behind
[2:01:20] it a man is like a book that's unsealed
[2:01:26] Amen you're feeding your dwelling in the
[2:01:29] land and Christ is bringing his word to
[2:01:32] pass now unto him that is able to do a
[2:01:37] burning bundle II above what we could
[2:01:40] ask or think according to his power that
[2:01:45] worketh in US unto Hilma be glory in the
[2:01:50] church by Jesus Christ amen
[2:01:55] fellowshipping the mystery of God you
[2:02:01] love him this morning
[2:02:03] I'll just say it like this of a song
[2:02:05] that we are so familiar with and we just
[2:02:08] stop there turn your eyes on Jesus look
[2:02:15] full in his wonderful face and the
[2:02:17] things of this earth will grow strangely
[2:02:21] dim look at him he has remember like the
[2:02:29] woman with the issue of blood she had it
[2:02:32] she tried everything to get rid of that
[2:02:35] but she said in her heart the Bible said
[2:02:39] she said within herself you just say
[2:02:44] that right now if I can but touch the
[2:02:47] hem of His garment I shall be made whole
[2:02:52] he did not feel her physical touch but
[2:02:56] he felt that touch
[2:02:59] it made contact with him it caused him
[2:03:04] to stop he was on his way to driver's
[2:03:05] house who touched said woman thy faith
[2:03:17] has made thee you've got faith I said
[2:03:26] you've got faith faith to raise up in
[2:03:29] that promise of God to accept God to
[2:03:33] accept what he's already done you've got
[2:03:36] faith then has forgotten more faith the
[2:03:40] righteousness of God is revealed from
[2:03:41] faith in the faith that's God for more
[2:03:43] faith

[2:03:47] cleansing from all doubt and unbelief
[2:03:52] that's how it is even with the promise
[2:03:56] of God for healing
[2:03:57] it takes God to call us to that promise
[2:04:00] he calls us to it and then what does he
[2:04:02] do he brings sanctifying power to remove
[2:04:06] all doubt and unbelief to where then
[2:04:11] you're standing right there in that word
[2:04:12] and said be it unto me according to thy
[2:04:17] word and he comes and fulfills his word
[2:04:23] or if I could say it any more plainer
[2:04:27] this morning he loves you and he wants
[2:04:31] to do for you what only he can do and
[2:04:36] what he's done he wants to do more he

[2:21:05] oh wait
[2:21:07] [Music]
[2:23:05] that Minister that stands here not only
[2:23:08] has to be
[2:24:31] yes
[2:25:25] I was sitting back there and thinking
[2:25:27] about the baptism today I was thinking
[2:25:29] about Jonathan getting baptized and him
[2:25:33] desiring this for a little while now but
[2:25:35] I was thinking we were going to baptize
[2:25:38] it any Church could do what we're doing
[2:25:41] right now they could map you could
[2:25:43] repent and you could get baptized in the
[2:25:45] name of Jesus Christ but the important
[2:25:48] thing is receiving the baptism of Holy
[2:25:49] Spirit and you know like I don't believe
[2:25:53] he's too young I asked him how old he
[2:25:55] was he said he's 12 my daughter gave her
[2:25:58] life at 12 and at 16 she received the
[2:26:01] Holy Ghost and she's still serving the
[2:26:03] Lord so I believe that we're doing this
[2:26:05] step and it's not for him just to stand
[2:26:08] at this point is to desire it they had
[2:26:11] the baptism the Holy Ghost I remember
[2:26:14] when I when I came to the Lord and I
[2:26:17] came to a message church an older pastor
[2:26:21] preacher told me he says you need the
[2:26:23] baptism when we go and I thought I had
[2:26:25] it but I knew but I found out that that
[2:26:28] was different than what I had received
[2:26:30] in a denominational Church so I believe
[2:26:33] now that even as we baptize Jonathan
[2:26:36] that that promises for him and he he
[2:26:40] could go forward and got even baptized
[2:26:42] him now
[2:26:43] in the Holy Ghost to have that power to
[2:26:46] live that life so as we
[2:26:55] we pray father Lord that you bless
[2:26:58] Jonathan Lord and Lord your promises
[2:27:00] that he might be received the Holy Ghost
[2:27:03] the power of the Holy Ghost Lord that
[2:27:06] his desire his hunger might be holy for
[2:27:09] you we ask you Lord Jesus as he comes
[2:27:14] now confessing Lord you into his heart
[2:27:18] we baptized him now Lord in the name of
[2:27:21] the Lord Jesus Christ where you're a man
