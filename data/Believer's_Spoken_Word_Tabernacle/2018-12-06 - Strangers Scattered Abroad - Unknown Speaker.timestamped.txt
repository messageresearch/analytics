[23:12] amen what a privilege we we are as a
[23:16] people of God in this hour oh my the
[23:20] grace of God that truly has come to us
[23:22] nothing that we've merited it's
[23:24] completely the grace of God when you
[23:27] think of it how much how great is the
[23:30] grace to speak of this hour of what God
[23:33] would open to you and I the closing out
[23:36] of all things and it comes to you and I
[23:40] grace grace grace amen I believe that's
[23:45] the reality when God's grace has so
[23:48] struck our hearts and that reality it
[23:51] takes ahold sin loses any hold
[23:55] whatsoever to recognize what he's
[23:58] already done for you
[24:01] oh my that's with everything in every
[24:04] need
[24:04] oh we just think God tonight for His
[24:06] mercy and we just so grateful to be able
[24:10] to make the acquaintance of brother
[24:11] Jason to Mars and so glad to have him
[24:14] here and he's got two is two of the
[24:17] daughters are here with him and his wife
[24:19] and the littlest one has had to be back
[24:22] at the hotel room wasn't feeling too
[24:23] well so we want to remember them in
[24:25] prayer that God will just comfort them
[24:28] and would just just strengthen them and
[24:30] we're just looking forward to the word
[24:32] of the Lord and I believe that God
[24:34] really has something special in store
[24:36] for us tonight because every time that
[24:39] his people gather according to his word
[24:41] he will always honor his word he said
[24:45] wherever two or three are gathered
[24:46] together in my name there will I'd be in
[24:49] the midst and that's what really makes a
[24:51] meeting is when he's in the midst how
[24:54] many times when they walked down the
[24:56] road when Luke 24 how many times had
[24:58] they been and maybe that little place
[25:00] that little home and where they had
[25:02] gathered but that day it was a different
[25:05] day when he came in and they invited him
[25:07] in that was different the whole focus
[25:10] itself everything changed there
[25:12] an illumination that began to move
[25:13] within their heart to guide them to the
[25:16] promise that God had for them of the
[25:18] Holy Ghost oh it was a great day in that
[25:21] hour aren't you grateful for God's grace
[25:23] all it took was them to say they
[25:25] constrained him and said come in oh my
[25:29] and so in this time we just want to
[25:31] welcome brother Jason and just so good
[25:34] to have him here the first time and we
[25:37] just want to make him feel welcome hold
[25:39] on the gift of God and just to glean
[25:42] from the word but Jason come brother god
[25:44] bless you tonight amen brother and it's
[25:47] good to have you amen god bless you each
[25:50] and every one
[26:02] god bless you all we're glad to be here
[26:05] with you we got some treacherous roads
[26:14] treacherous roads and things but you're
[26:16] out here and it's not just a religious
[26:22] habit but it's something that's in your
[26:24] heart and that's that's the greatest
[26:28] pressure it might make the state might
[26:31] fall with that that something on the
[26:34] inside
[26:34] yes that's browning you that's keeping
[26:37] you regardless of all these difficulties
[26:41] situations that's
[26:57] privileged revelation understand we mark
[27:08] in this day
[27:24] three dots
[27:31] what a revelation what a joy understand
[27:35] that Lord we want to give our hearts to
[27:42] move moving our lives
[27:46] moving our homes moving our families
[27:51] moving our neighbourhoods Lord yes and
[27:54] let us just be there as a vessel that as
[27:58] as the prophet of God said I was just
[28:02] there while he was doing it yes and so
[28:06] let us be people of Prayer yes that
[28:09] would really see your hand and
[28:11] everything in our lives we ask it Lord
[28:13] in the name of Jesus Christ amen if you
[28:17] want to bring up the PowerPoint I just
[28:21] tonight I'm gonna share my testimony how
[28:24] the Lord called me to the Ministry
[28:26] called me to the message and and how the
[28:30] missions work that we're doing what the
[28:32] Lord is doing there and in a few
[28:33] scriptures we'll talk about as well so I
[28:37] just to start just very briefly I work
[28:40] with Iran Ian's
[28:42] rep they're mostly I'm working with
[28:45] refugees that have fled Iran and that
[28:47] are living now in the country of Turkey
[28:50] so the two countries are neighboring to
[28:52] each other there and from there I'll
[28:56] share some more background as we go
[29:01] forward and if you want to bring up
[29:03] second slide so I grew up in a Lutheran
[29:08] home my mom my mom and dad raised me to
[29:13] believe the Bible which is strange
[29:16] hearing that I was in a Lutheran home
[29:17] and we believed the Bible but my mom
[29:19] attended someone called Bible Study
[29:23] Fellowship it was a Bible study for
[29:25] women actually she still does to this
[29:27] day and this is what I also attended as
[29:31] a child with her and it was just
[29:32] emphasized we believe the Bible and it
[29:35] was actually it's a like an inner
[29:36] denominational type of thing
[29:38] and so that was something that was just
[29:40] functional in me from the very
[29:42] foundation and so as time went on I I
[29:49] was involved with sports I'll put it
[29:50] that way
[29:51] that was my whole life baseball
[29:53] basketball and football
[29:54] I ate it and read that and slept it that
[29:58] was to me that was everything III can
[30:02] think back and most of my memories as a
[30:05] child is somehow involving sports for
[30:08] myself or for my brother or watching
[30:10] professional games with my dad and
[30:14] getting into high school I was pretty
[30:16] good at all three sports as well and as
[30:20] time went along I was getting recruited
[30:22] to go to different colleges to play
[30:27] there right at the end of mice I I was a
[30:30] worldly kid basically all that time but
[30:34] coming into the end of my senior year I
[30:35] got hooked up with kind of the wrong
[30:37] crowd and I started smoking marijuana
[30:39] and drinking and it wasn't something
[30:42] that I was engaged in at all because of
[30:44] sports but somehow I got roped into it
[30:48] and it was through someone pushing and
[30:51] influencing and influencing me and I
[30:54] said no many times but it just sucks
[30:56] saying yes one time and that was took
[31:00] the ball down the wrong wrong court so
[31:04] during a during all this that was going
[31:06] on my partying and and that kind of
[31:09] lifestyle
[31:10] I had to select the college that I was
[31:13] gonna go to so there was different
[31:15] private colleges that I was I was
[31:17] looking at one was Lutheran another was
[31:20] Catholic and so on one was a Baptist
[31:22] that was very conservative and serious
[31:25] about Christianity and it was a definite
[31:27] part of school that was that's Bethel
[31:29] University so I was looking at the
[31:33] schools I remember sitting in my room
[31:35] and I heard a voice speak go to Bethel
[31:37] College and so I never had an experience
[31:41] like that before but it was something
[31:43] that was just like an it was written
[31:46] with an iron pen on my soul immediately
[31:49] I picked up the phone and I told the
[31:50] coach
[31:51] coming to Bethel I went out and told my
[31:54] parents and they were there they were
[31:56] shocked because they knew what I was
[31:58] doing that I would make that choice
[32:00] where they were very happy that I made
[32:03] that decision to go to a Christian
[32:04] school and I went there and just like
[32:08] you can find at any school you can find
[32:11] the party crowd very easily and I did
[32:16] and I kind of went along that route for
[32:19] the first about two years my for some
[32:23] reason I went to that school and the
[32:24] coaches just they didn't like me they
[32:28] recruited me I came from what I
[32:31] understand I did well but it was
[32:33] something that was like their minds were
[32:35] blinded to continuing with me to play to
[32:39] play me more and so I was so frustrated
[32:41] and it's a lot of time that you dedicate
[32:44] a lot of effort that you dedicate and
[32:46] you miss a lot of things when you're
[32:48] playing especially playing college
[32:50] sports and I was just fed up with all of
[32:54] that and not getting the reward of
[32:55] playing and the games and so I just told
[32:58] my dad and mom I think I'm gonna quit
[33:00] playing playing sports and I'll just do
[33:04] intramural stuff something that's fun
[33:07] because it's not really fun for me
[33:09] anymore and and it was really God's Way
[33:12] of getting me to slow down and seeing
[33:16] that there's other priorities in life
[33:18] and so I started playing intramural
[33:20] basketball and there's these two
[33:21] Presbyterian Calvinists that I became
[33:24] friends with we played on the same team
[33:26] together and so we would get together
[33:28] all the time and they were just
[33:31] passionate about predestination and the
[33:34] Reformation and so they just would talk
[33:36] about it all the time then they would
[33:38] ask me questions I had no idea what
[33:40] they're talking about I just listened
[33:42] yeah yeah okay so then they would ask me
[33:46] well what do you think we'd be talking
[33:49] about predestination do you believe in
[33:50] predestination said how I've never even
[33:52] heard of it before but you're quoting
[33:55] the Bible so if it's in the Bible
[33:56] absolutely I believe that
[33:59] and so they said well why are you living
[34:01] the way you're living if that's you
[34:04] believe in predestination you believe in
[34:06] the Bible
[34:06] why are you partying and swearing every
[34:09] other word and why are you doing that
[34:11] said well I know I shouldn't do it and
[34:15] I'll stop doing it eventually but right
[34:17] now I'm just having some fun and I went
[34:20] along like that probably for another
[34:22] year or so and these guys kept just
[34:25] talking about these things talking about
[34:27] salvation by faith without works without
[34:31] the works of the law and it's just
[34:33] something they're just constantly
[34:34] talking about I remember one day so we
[34:37] we would go every Tuesday to Buffalo
[34:41] Wild Wings they had cheap wings for
[34:43] college students and so we would get we
[34:46] would go there and that's where we would
[34:48] talk about the Lord and I I would enter
[34:52] in a little bit but really I just said
[34:54] it listened for hours really one time I
[34:57] was driving home from there and as I was
[35:01] as I was driving I was kind of you know
[35:04] you go through hopefully none of you
[35:07] have gone through this but if you ever
[35:09] have and you've had have godly influence
[35:12] and you have a mother praying for you
[35:13] you'll go and you'll go to a party
[35:16] you'll do the things you shouldn't do
[35:18] and then you come home and you have a
[35:20] conviction in your heart what am i doing
[35:24] why am I doing this I don't understand
[35:26] it it's like I don't have power to stop
[35:29] I want to stop even I go to these
[35:32] parties and tell people no no no okay
[35:36] and but then I get home you know I've
[35:39] got Bible class in the morning at this
[35:42] College
[35:43] so I get back and I've been smoking
[35:46] marijuana and I opened my Bible and I
[35:48] start reading oh my oh I'm just so
[35:51] convicted all right I'm gonna stop I'm
[35:53] gonna stop it I'm gonna stop it and then
[35:57] the next time it comes the same thing
[35:59] repeat repeat repeat repeat so
[36:03] eventually as I'm driving home back to
[36:06] that after many times of trying to stop
[36:10] on my own power
[36:11] I just said lord I just want to serve
[36:15] you I didn't pray the sinner's prayer I
[36:18] didn't have any formula I just said I
[36:21] just want to serve you Lord and it was
[36:23] like in that instant all the weight of
[36:25] my sin left my shoulders and so I was
[36:32] changed from that time there was a
[36:35] hunger inside of me for the Word of God
[36:38] that I couldn't describe before that
[36:42] reading a book it never happened I don't
[36:44] know that through through all the
[36:46] schooling that I had done if I'd
[36:47] actually read the entire assignments
[36:50] that were given to me I don't know that
[36:52] I'd ever read a book maybe my mom could
[36:54] tell different but I'm pretty sure I
[36:56] never did then all of a sudden I started
[37:00] going to this Baptist Church and the
[37:03] pastor said if you don't have money just
[37:05] take the books from our bookstore I
[37:07] don't care just write it down what you
[37:09] took and well in that why you didn't pay
[37:12] for it but just take it so then I
[37:13] started reading the the full the full
[37:17] works of Jonathan Edwards if you receive
[37:20] you read that it's very complicated
[37:22] frankly half of it I had no idea what
[37:24] was being said I just figured if I read
[37:26] it again and again eventually I'll
[37:28] figure out what he's talking about and
[37:31] I've started reading Charles Spurgeon
[37:32] and Martin Luther and John Calvin and
[37:36] anything I could get my hands on I was
[37:38] just so hungry and I would meet with
[37:40] these guys and we would get together and
[37:42] talk with people then Armenians would
[37:45] come and we as Calvinists would argue
[37:48] against them in the school and we'd go
[37:51] back and forth
[37:52] predestination versus freewill and and
[37:56] one time they they invited this this guy
[37:58] said there's this this guy's got strange
[38:01] doctrine follows this man or something
[38:04] and but maybe we get straighten them out
[38:07] so we'll have them come and we'll have
[38:09] some fellowship and talk about the
[38:12] Scriptures together and I just found it
[38:15] so interesting because this this brother
[38:18] comes and he's an artist so he starts
[38:21] writing out starts drawing a wheat plant
[38:23] first he draws the the stock he says
[38:27] that's Luther's justification by faith
[38:30] then he continues drawing then there's
[38:32] the tassel that's sanctification from
[38:34] Wesley and and then there's the shock it
[38:36] see how it looks just like a seed but
[38:38] it's not a seed it's just the carrier of
[38:41] the seed that's the restoration of the
[38:43] gifts said in that though is the
[38:45] original seed and that's God's purpose
[38:48] for the Reformation is to restore us
[38:50] back to the original faith and I thought
[38:53] oh this makes more sense than anything
[38:55] I've heard before this this ties the
[38:59] Reformation together and makes it you
[39:01] you see the purpose of God in it it's
[39:04] not just a random event that produced
[39:06] many denominations but it's God
[39:08] specifically trying to restore it so
[39:11] that we continue to talk and he gave me
[39:13] different books Church ages book and
[39:15] gave me the anointed ones at the endtime
[39:17] sermon and so I put that in my car and I
[39:19] remember I just listened to that repeat
[39:22] just over and over and over again for
[39:24] three four or five months straight and I
[39:27] was just transfixed by what brother
[39:31] Branham was talking about I may not have
[39:35] understood serpent seed or other things
[39:37] that he was talking about but when he
[39:39] was speaking about predestination it was
[39:42] just it wasn't just a theory for brother
[39:44] Branham that's what I noticed wasn't
[39:47] just a theory of for brother Branham but
[39:48] it actually is a reality not just a
[39:52] doctrine but something real that has
[39:55] significance today really that really
[39:58] struck me and then the things that he
[40:00] said that Trinity is not even in the
[40:01] Bible so how can he say that but then I
[40:06] began to search through my goodness this
[40:08] is absolutely right it isn't in the
[40:10] Bible and there's no denominations in
[40:13] the Bible they're from the devil oh I
[40:15] thought how actually there's no way to
[40:18] even argue with that are they from God
[40:21] really anyone can seriously say that
[40:24] these are these are a godly thing so
[40:26] they really struck me then he started
[40:29] this brother started sharing with me
[40:30] about the church ages and the special
[40:33] especially he said he said read about
[40:36] the Laodicean church
[40:37] they're in Revelation chapter 3 don't
[40:41] you think it applies exactly to today
[40:43] and so I started reading and I'm like
[40:44] wow
[40:45] if this isn't exactly the hour that
[40:47] we're living in I don't know what is so
[40:50] then I started reading the church Ages
[40:51] book at the point at this point in time
[40:53] in my life when I got saved I had
[40:55] changed my major from business to to
[40:59] philosophy with a minor in theology and
[41:02] so my purpose was to go and to go on to
[41:05] seminary and to become get a at least a
[41:10] master's degree or if not a doctorate in
[41:12] theology in order to be a pastor
[41:15] okay so at that point in time in my life
[41:18] that's when I came to the message and it
[41:21] was just amazing how the Lord work
[41:24] because that I started meeting with the
[41:27] pastor there brother Don Hoffman
[41:29] he's now my father-in-law but started
[41:33] meeting with him and he never said okay
[41:35] this is what you must do it you can't do
[41:37] that you need to throw your shorts away
[41:39] you need to snot go to seminary you need
[41:41] he never said any of that his just
[41:43] approach was answer some specific
[41:45] questions if I had them and concurred me
[41:48] continue to listen to what read what the
[41:51] Prophet said and study what the Prophet
[41:53] said and you know I'd go I was ordering
[41:56] the tapes from from voice of God and
[41:59] okay here comes Satan's Eden I read that
[42:01] shorts go on the trash can and then you
[42:06] hear things about seminary okay and I
[42:09] but my thing that hung me up was how how
[42:13] do I prepare myself for ministry I
[42:16] should go to seminary it's still even
[42:18] when I was new to the message I thought
[42:19] I'll go to seminary because I was in
[42:22] taking the--how theological classes at
[42:25] the time and I thought they were very
[42:27] edifying for me because I was constantly
[42:30] arguing the message with my professors
[42:33] and students in the classes it was it
[42:36] was really challenging to me and so I
[42:39] thought wow this is really helping me
[42:41] grow I'll just continue it in seminary
[42:43] and because it'll make me dig deep and
[42:46] what is the everything this is what
[42:48] theology says about it the denomination
[42:50] says about it this
[42:51] but the message says about it and it'll
[42:53] help me but as time our continuing to
[42:55] listen I'm like Manny's really mocking
[42:58] these seminary graduates what should I
[43:01] do
[43:02] I remember one time asking brother Don
[43:04] well how do I prepare myself for
[43:06] ministry said well you already are why
[43:09] don't you just preach if you're called
[43:11] to preach that's what you do you go and
[43:13] you preach said my that's how would you
[43:16] do that I don't know how I don't know
[43:19] how to
[43:20] you said you pray and ask God to give
[43:23] you the words and then you come and
[43:24] bring your message you want to take
[43:27] Wednesday service I have to think about
[43:31] that but after a time I started started
[43:36] preaching in the church and I know
[43:38] everyone was very patient with me cuz it
[43:41] was like a theological student preaching
[43:43] the message very complicated big words
[43:46] and everyone was like what is he talking
[43:49] about I need a dictionary never listen
[43:53] to this guy but God was gracious and and
[43:56] worked with me through all that and the
[43:58] people were at the church too so if you
[44:01] want to go on to the next screen so as
[44:04] time went on I continued to minister in
[44:06] the church but I kind of was looking for
[44:10] what my calling was and not really sure
[44:12] what that would be as time went along I
[44:17] just kind of because I didn't have a
[44:20] real vision of what I was supposed to be
[44:22] doing
[44:22] I started getting back slid a little bit
[44:27] not not in the sense of going worldly
[44:29] but just not on fire for God anymore and
[44:32] so this was probably back in from the
[44:36] years 2006 to 2008 and I I spent a lot
[44:44] of time learning how to do internet
[44:46] marketing for network marketing
[44:50] businesses especially social media and
[44:52] Google AdWords and all those kind of
[44:55] things building websites and that fed
[44:59] into being in a not on fire for the Lord
[45:02] condition
[45:03] and I remember one time I went up to my
[45:05] family's cabin and I was driving there
[45:08] and the Lord was just really dealing
[45:10] with me he he spoke some things and he
[45:13] sent me into another city and just the
[45:15] whole time he just anointed me again a
[45:20] fresh really is what it felt felt like
[45:22] and the fire and the passion returned
[45:25] and and what he spoke to me when I went
[45:28] to this place was that I want you to use
[45:30] the the gift or the what you've learned
[45:33] about internet marketing for my kingdom
[45:35] and so from there I started recording
[45:38] videos teachings teaching the message
[45:40] started writing articles and putting it
[45:44] out as much as I could on on Facebook
[45:47] YouTube and and doing search engine
[45:51] optimization all that kind of stuff back
[45:54] at that time and so I started getting
[45:55] contacts from people all around the
[45:58] world message believers and different
[46:01] ones wanting to me to come and and visit
[46:03] them and I always had it in my mind that
[46:05] I wanted to help in a place where no one
[46:07] was helping this was just something that
[46:10] is fine to help in other places Africa
[46:14] and in South America and Mexico and
[46:18] that's fantastic but for me that just I
[46:20] was looking for something where nobody
[46:22] was working and so then I got a contact
[46:25] from a brother in Iranian brother who
[46:27] had left left Iran and was living in
[46:31] Istanbul Turkey and he invited me said
[46:33] we have a refugee church here please
[46:35] come and visit us and please help us
[46:41] with materials and so forth and so they
[46:43] they had been around the message for
[46:45] about 15 years they were following some
[46:49] different doctrines he Walt Frank
[46:51] doctrines over there which I didn't know
[46:54] initially but they had only had five
[46:57] messages of brother Branham translated
[47:00] in in that 15 years and so I got a
[47:04] burden to see see them get more
[47:07] materials in their hands and I'd never
[47:09] sponsored translations so I really know
[47:11] what to do but I just told them you know
[47:13] we'll figure that out
[47:14] on the fly but just
[47:16] if you have somebody that can translate
[47:17] get him started and will support him so
[47:20] that he'd be full-time doing that and so
[47:23] they found a brother to do that and this
[47:26] brother kept saying when are you coming
[47:27] to Turkey when you come to Turkey my
[47:29] initial reaction when he invited me to
[47:31] Turkey was it's too dangerous to go to
[47:34] the Middle East I'm not going there let
[47:39] somebody else go I'll support the
[47:42] translations and I'll work with him on
[47:44] email and chat and Skype but I'm not
[47:48] going to that country it's too dangerous
[47:50] and as time went on the Lord kept
[47:53] convicting my heart what are you doing
[47:56] why aren't you going and so I took some
[47:59] I was working at Wells Fargo Home
[48:02] Mortgage at the time this was 2011 2009
[48:05] was when I got in contact with the
[48:07] brother so just about two years later
[48:09] when I surrendered to the call to go on
[48:12] my first missions trip to Turkey and my
[48:14] wife came with me she was pregnant with
[48:17] Mina six months pregnant and came with
[48:21] me to Turkey also my father-in-law
[48:23] brother Don Hoffman and my mother-in-law
[48:25] sister Mary she came with and we visited
[48:29] a few churches and it was very alarming
[48:32] and filled me with a burden for them for
[48:35] how little of the message that people
[48:36] knew they knew about brother Branham
[48:38] they knew that we were not Trinitarians
[48:42] they knew about water baptism but beyond
[48:44] that it was really hit or miss what they
[48:46] knew and what they didn't know mostly
[48:49] what I found out years late two years
[48:51] later was mostly the translations they
[48:53] had were of a walled Frank and so they
[48:58] really didn't know what the message was
[48:59] all about basically they had a
[49:02] Pentecostal church that had a little bit
[49:04] of message sprinkled on top on top of it
[49:07] so we were really burdened for that and
[49:10] so we really worked harder with that
[49:13] with the brother who was translating for
[49:14] us to get that over there after I got
[49:17] home from the trip you know I had taken
[49:19] like almost my full year's worth of
[49:22] vacation and I'm like how in the world
[49:24] can I continue this ministry it's
[49:26] February my vacation is gone I
[49:28] even go back yet and the Lord had a
[49:31] solution he said quit your job and go
[49:33] full-time and I was like no that's not
[49:39] gonna happen
[49:40] you know I come from the background my
[49:42] grandfather had the same job for 55
[49:45] years my dad had the same job for 35 I
[49:48] think my brothers probably had the same
[49:49] job for 35 years
[49:51] so everything was about all about
[49:53] stability get a job staying and get a
[49:57] good retirement and that's it
[49:59] so God's telling me just forget all that
[50:02] you have no salary
[50:04] you know the churches our churches are
[50:06] not very big and definitely can't can't
[50:10] support me and so there was no promise
[50:12] there there's no promise from anyone
[50:14] else so it was a real internal struggle
[50:17] that went on for the next year and a
[50:19] half between me and the Lord and every
[50:23] time quit your job and go full-time but
[50:26] I have bills to pay let alone taking a
[50:32] trip there to buy a ticket and pay for
[50:34] everything in between I don't know how
[50:37] it's possible and so this this battle
[50:40] was raging there for a year and a half
[50:43] and then we came to I think the spring
[50:48] of 2012 and three things happen right in
[50:53] a row in the same week on on a Sunday
[50:55] afternoon we had an outreach service in
[50:57] a Somali area one of the young Iranian
[51:00] guys that was living in Minneapolis at
[51:03] the time got up and gave a testimony and
[51:05] started saying when when are when your
[51:08] boss at work sends you on a business
[51:11] trip you have total confidence that your
[51:14] hotels gonna be paid for your
[51:16] transportation is gonna be paid for and
[51:18] your food's all gonna be paid for he
[51:21] says but when God sends you so you know
[51:24] I'd never shared this what the Lord had
[51:26] been telling me with anyone besides my
[51:28] wife I didn't even tell my pastor
[51:30] because he's my father-in-law too
[51:33] uh-huh so I didn't tell anyone
[51:37] so this brother gets up and he starts
[51:39] saying this and the tears start coming
[51:41] down my face so when the look when the
[51:43] Lord calls you to do something you're
[51:47] not sure if he's gonna support your
[51:48] mission you where is your faith where is
[51:52] your confidence and so I yes that's
[51:55] exactly right where is my faith where is
[51:58] my confidence God has sent me and I'm
[52:00] not listening so then on Wednesday
[52:04] brother in our church brother Greg
[52:06] Schwartz was preaching I honestly have
[52:08] no idea what the message is about my
[52:09] mind was totally and completely thinking
[52:11] about how am I gonna do this the Lord's
[52:14] asking me to go full-time I don't have
[52:17] where am I gonna get a salary where am I
[52:19] gonna take care of this how is this
[52:21] going to work
[52:22] and the brother is preaching and I'm
[52:25] thinking well what about my family
[52:28] that's what I have a picture up there my
[52:30] family what about my family
[52:32] how will I provide for them and as I'm
[52:35] thinking about this brother Greg says
[52:37] and you say what about my family
[52:40] don't you know that God is more than
[52:42] able to take care of your family oh wow
[52:48] so then I'm thinking but what about my
[52:50] future I won't have insurance I won't
[52:52] have retirement what will I do and right
[52:56] there he says and you say well what
[52:57] about my future don't you know that the
[53:02] same God that can provide for your
[53:03] family and provide for your future also
[53:06] and so after the service I got on my
[53:10] face before the Lord I said okay I know
[53:11] what you're asking me to do but this
[53:13] seems crazy how will I do it and so we
[53:19] the next day a brother in the church
[53:22] since that sends out a quote and brother
[53:24] branham's talking about Joshua and so
[53:27] Joshua he says people looking at the
[53:29] outside saw Joshua could say he was
[53:32] reckless he was going to attack a
[53:34] mountain where there was giants that was
[53:38] reckless to the world he says but the
[53:41] thing of it was as soon as Joshua had
[53:44] the word of the Lord he could be wrecked
[53:46] this I remember reading it on my phone
[53:49] in my car and I just laughed and put it
[53:52] through my phone to the side and said
[53:54] okay it couldn't get any more clear Lord
[53:56] three things in a row you've told me
[53:59] exactly in the mouth of two or three
[54:01] witnesses let every word be established
[54:03] these people know nothing about what I'm
[54:06] going through they don't know at all
[54:08] what my what what God is speaking to me
[54:12] so I go and tell my wife and she just
[54:15] says well I as soon as you started
[54:17] working with Iranians I knew you'd be
[54:19] full time God will provide for us oh
[54:23] it's not that simple
[54:27] that's what my thinking was how will I
[54:30] do it you know as a man we like to
[54:31] figure things out we like to have a plan
[54:33] we like to have all everything the
[54:37] budget is perfectly worked out and then
[54:39] we're satisfied and so here God was
[54:42] saying nothing works on paper and it
[54:46] never will but obey me do what I've
[54:49] asked you to do and so that was in April
[54:52] and it was August before I could
[54:54] actually put my four week notice in so
[54:57] you see my faith was so strong that I
[55:00] put four weeks no notice and and then
[55:05] immediately after I was done with my
[55:06] work there at Wells Fargo I went on my
[55:08] first missions trip and the Lord is
[55:12] that's been since - the August 2012 the
[55:15] Lord has provided for us every month
[55:19] we've had many many struggles and
[55:22] difficulties and and yet at the same
[55:25] time we've never missed our bills
[55:29] we've never obviously I've never went
[55:32] hungry we're all we're all by God's
[55:38] grace he's provided because he promised
[55:40] has nothing to do with me has nothing to
[55:43] do with my ability completely it's been
[55:46] him because he said so and that's the
[55:49] thing is you know many times you get
[55:52] discouraged and wonder how is this going
[55:54] to happen how can we do this all we're
[55:56] in trouble now what is going to happen
[55:59] but every time God provides and so
[56:03] that's the thing it was him that called
[56:05] me to do it this is not my this wasn't
[56:07] my will
[56:08] it wasn't my purpose it's not even what
[56:10] I wanted to do but God wanted to do
[56:14] something and so it's been him if you
[56:17] want to go onto the next screen
[56:19] so first Peter 1 verse 1 Peter an
[56:24] apostle of Jesus Christ to the strangers
[56:25] scattered throughout Pontus Galatia
[56:28] Cappadocia Asia and Bithynia so a couple
[56:32] of those words strangers there means a
[56:35] resident foreigner so it's in our modern
[56:40] terms today we would look at it as a
[56:42] refugee and then where it says scattered
[56:45] there it's that word is porous so
[56:49] someone who's dispersed from their
[56:50] original homeland so here you have Peter
[56:54] he's writing to people that live in the
[56:57] areas of Pontus Galatia Cappadocia Asia
[57:00] and Bithynia and he's writing to
[57:02] refugees that lived there so in the
[57:05] first stage in the Alpha age the bride
[57:09] is ministering to refugees in these five
[57:14] areas okay so you want to go to the next
[57:17] screen where are these areas you see
[57:21] that each five of those areas is all in
[57:24] modern-day Turkey and so in the seventh
[57:28] age in the Omega age the bride is
[57:31] ministering the word to refugees living
[57:35] in Asia both in iya Cappadocia Galatia
[57:40] and pontus and so you just see how that
[57:44] the gospel is returning back to the
[57:47] lands you know really this area was
[57:50] probably the the most heavily populated
[57:52] Christian area in the times of the early
[57:56] church
[57:56] I think the first seven councils that
[58:00] the church held were all within Turkey
[58:03] the Council of Nicaea that was in Turkey
[58:07] all seven obviously all seven church
[58:11] there we're all in Asia Minor which is
[58:14] southwest Turkey
[58:17] so if you want to go on to the next
[58:19] screen from the endtime sign seed
[58:22] brother Branham says all your Bible
[58:24] readers know that what happened
[58:26] civilization travels from the east to
[58:28] the west China is the oldest
[58:31] civilization we have civilization began
[58:34] in the east its went with the Sun
[58:35] traveling west where's it at now the
[58:37] west coast if it goes any further it's
[58:39] back east again see what I mean and so
[58:42] the gospel also travels with that
[58:44] civilization and so we have here in
[58:47] brother Branham he's standing there at
[58:49] the West Coast the messenger to the
[58:52] seventh church age he's saying if any
[58:54] goes any further it's gonna go back east
[58:56] and we know that the message has gone
[58:58] back east again but where is it going to
[59:00] it has a direction that it's proceeded
[59:03] proceeding to and it's proceeding back
[59:05] to Jerusalem and so it's cut now it's
[59:09] back very close to Jerusalem it's back
[59:12] in the Middle East and the Lord is
[59:14] moving amongst Muslim nations if you
[59:16] want to go to the next screen here's a
[59:18] little information about Turkey it's 99%
[59:21] Muslim the refugees are welcome there
[59:26] and left alone regarding religion so
[59:29] this has really provided an open door
[59:31] for us we don't face any trouble at all
[59:34] really
[59:35] evangelizing Muslims that are refugees
[59:38] there a few brothers that I work with
[59:42] have won a few Turk Turkish people to
[59:47] Christ and from those people they've all
[59:50] had trouble with the government
[59:53] thankfully it's not been something that
[59:55] was sustained but they've been
[59:56] interviewed what are you doing how are
[59:59] you evangelizing and it all came down to
[1:00:01] we were simply answering questions that
[1:00:03] people have this is our job that's what
[1:00:07] God has called us to do we're not going
[1:00:10] around by the street to try to force
[1:00:12] people to become Christians if they come
[1:00:15] to us we answer their questions and from
[1:00:18] that answer mostly the government says
[1:00:20] ok they don't give any more problem from
[1:00:23] there
[1:00:26] actually we've experienced the
[1:00:29] government protecting us in different
[1:00:33] situations we had at one time when I was
[1:00:35] preaching some Afghans came and knocked
[1:00:38] on the door Afghan Muslims and they
[1:00:42] pulled one of the brothers out of the
[1:00:44] church and they beat him up so the
[1:00:47] pastor later went with the brother and
[1:00:49] reported it to the police and the police
[1:00:52] said well if there's an American
[1:00:54] minister with you we want to put a
[1:00:55] protective detail on him to keep him
[1:00:59] safe we said well that's not necessary
[1:01:00] they said well we'll put somebody
[1:01:02] outside of the apartment where you're
[1:01:03] staying in plain clothes you won't know
[1:01:06] who he is but someone will be there
[1:01:09] watching and making sure everything's
[1:01:11] okay for you
[1:01:13] turkey is a second world country on the
[1:01:17] verge of a first world the United States
[1:01:19] and Europe have put a ton of money into
[1:01:21] the infrastructure and businesses and so
[1:01:24] forth there you could find Starbucks
[1:01:27] Burger King McDonald's KFC Popeyes
[1:01:30] Domino's I mean any just about any
[1:01:34] restaurant that you want there so it's
[1:01:37] it's um it's easy to travel there Travel
[1:01:40] is very cheap the the dollar is very
[1:01:43] strong compared to the Turkish lira so
[1:01:46] it's also food is very cheap sometimes
[1:01:50] it just shocks you you you take five or
[1:01:52] six people out and it's less than what
[1:01:54] you had paid just for yourself at that
[1:01:58] similar restaurant in the United States
[1:02:00] it's so tourism is is huge also in
[1:02:05] Turkey you got Istanbul you've got the
[1:02:08] seven churches there you've got another
[1:02:09] eight area called Cappadocia which I
[1:02:12] think I'll show one picture of that area
[1:02:13] later is very beautiful spot and because
[1:02:17] tourism is about 30 percent of their
[1:02:20] economy they're very keen on keeping
[1:02:23] visitor safe and so we're just this is
[1:02:28] all this is the perfect storm of being
[1:02:30] able to evangelize Muslims that the Lord
[1:02:33] has just laid everything out so that we
[1:02:36] can safely go there
[1:02:38] I mean for sure there's dangers but not
[1:02:41] from the Turkish government by God's
[1:02:43] grace but everything is laid out so that
[1:02:46] we can work with Muslims and evangelize
[1:02:50] them if you go onto the next screen a
[1:02:53] few thoughts on Islam sometimes there's
[1:02:56] misunderstandings and things like that
[1:02:59] but it was introduced by Muhammad and
[1:03:01] the six hundreds the Quran actually
[1:03:04] mentions Jesus more than Muhammad it
[1:03:09] gives Jesus the title the Word of God
[1:03:11] and the Spirit of God so these are just
[1:03:15] tremendous ways that we can kind of
[1:03:19] bridge the gap between Christianity and
[1:03:21] Islam Jesus and Mary it says Jesus and
[1:03:26] Mary are the only two born without sin
[1:03:28] so even even Muslims have some Catholic
[1:03:32] doctrine as well Jesus is the virgin
[1:03:35] born Messiah and prophet but they say
[1:03:38] it's a blasphemy to cut to call him the
[1:03:41] son of God
[1:03:43] the Sunni Muslims believe that Jesus
[1:03:46] will return and set up a caliph Muslim
[1:03:49] Caliphate to rule the world so they're
[1:03:52] waiting and looking for the coming of
[1:03:54] Jesus Christ the the Shia Muslim are
[1:03:58] looking for the 12th Imam to return with
[1:04:03] Jesus
[1:04:03] so all Muslims in one way or another are
[1:04:07] looking for Jesus to rule as king of
[1:04:09] kings and Lord of lords it never says it
[1:04:15] that Mohammed did one miracle in fact it
[1:04:17] says he didn't do any but it says Jesus
[1:04:21] raised the dead healed the sick spokes
[1:04:28] speaks about him doing many miracles in
[1:04:32] in Islam women have less worth it takes
[1:04:34] for women to testify in court which
[1:04:38] would be equal to the testimony of one
[1:04:40] man four wives are allowed in Islam and
[1:04:44] you can also have temporary marriage one
[1:04:49] hour two hours two weeks one
[1:04:52] as many as you as many times as you want
[1:04:55] can divorce and remarry women can
[1:04:57] divorce and remarry anytime they want a
[1:05:04] lot of times when you're speaking
[1:05:06] evangelizing a Muslim they speak as
[1:05:09] though their religion and they are very
[1:05:11] holy it's total nonsense it's total
[1:05:16] nonsense because they're they speak that
[1:05:20] way but you have to remember that in
[1:05:22] Islam when you speak to an unbeliever
[1:05:25] it's perfectly acceptable to lie Islam
[1:05:30] is or I'll say it this way Allah is the
[1:05:35] god of sex it's really what it is it's a
[1:05:39] religion built for men to abuse women
[1:05:43] the Quran itself says no problem you
[1:05:46] could beat your wife but just not too
[1:05:49] hard because she's also your property
[1:05:52] that's the reason they use just like
[1:05:54] your cow and so this is the value that
[1:05:58] women have in Islam it's it's it's
[1:06:03] terrible if you go to the next one
[1:06:07] brother Branham says this in the
[1:06:09] Philadelphia Church age the church
[1:06:11] ancient book when afternoon is I begin
[1:06:13] to minister one of thousands of
[1:06:14] muhammadans came up on the platform as
[1:06:17] she stood before me a missionary to the
[1:06:20] Muhammadans began to softly implore the
[1:06:22] Lord o for that precious soul o for that
[1:06:25] precious soul he had been over there for
[1:06:27] years and years and according to his own
[1:06:29] testimony he had seen only one
[1:06:31] come to receive Jesus Christ
[1:06:32] as Savior they were originally the
[1:06:35] medo-persians whose laws changed not
[1:06:37] they're so hard to win it seems that
[1:06:39] once a month always a
[1:06:42] is allah amongst them that's
[1:06:45] absolutely true there's laws against
[1:06:47] conversion if they if they convert they
[1:06:51] were born as a Muslim and they or they
[1:06:53] chose to become a Muslim and they
[1:06:55] convert from Islam to Christianity
[1:06:58] it's called apostasy and they're to be
[1:07:03] stoned to death
[1:07:04] from that so that's that that is
[1:07:08] absolutely it is a law and I love this
[1:07:11] because brother Branham says that when
[1:07:14] he was over there many many of them
[1:07:17] converted and there was a was listening
[1:07:21] to the supernatural at the book on tape
[1:07:23] on the way over here on the way over to
[1:07:26] Pennsylvania last week and listening in
[1:07:29] a man in a doctor's office you know
[1:07:32] brother Branham had gotten that amoeba
[1:07:34] in South Africa and so he was in the
[1:07:36] doctor's office and one of the other
[1:07:38] doctors was kind of an atheist and in
[1:07:41] said oh how did you do over there in
[1:07:44] your meetings in South Africa I bet it
[1:07:46] you didn't get any converts from them
[1:07:47] people so yeah we got about thirty
[1:07:49] thousand he said you got what thirty
[1:07:54] thousand yeah of who not Muslims yeah
[1:07:59] there was Muslims and there was Hindus
[1:08:02] yeah absolutely
[1:08:04] the man was shocked well you must be the
[1:08:06] most intelligent man in the world then
[1:08:09] doesn't have anything to do with me they
[1:08:11] just saw the Lord Jesus Christ in action
[1:08:14] and it changed their hearts and I think
[1:08:18] today in in Iran amongst the Iranians
[1:08:22] that is actually unpressed unprecedented
[1:08:25] in the history of Islam there are when I
[1:08:28] first started and in contact with
[1:08:30] Iranians in 2009 there was like around a
[1:08:34] hundred thousand Iranian Muslims that
[1:08:37] had converted to Christianity yet that
[1:08:40] denominations whatever it just just in
[1:08:43] general Christianity and by now they're
[1:08:48] estimating that there's at least in ten
[1:08:50] of the underground church there's at
[1:08:51] least two million Muslims that have come
[1:08:55] to Christ just in the last almost ten
[1:08:59] years so it's really it's never happened
[1:09:01] in the history of Islam anywhere usually
[1:09:04] it says brother branham said there's
[1:09:06] missionaries there's been missionaries
[1:09:07] that have gone for hundreds of years
[1:09:10] into Islamic countries and they just get
[1:09:12] their whole lifetime one two three
[1:09:16] converts we see brother Branham
[1:09:18] many in South Africa thousands and
[1:09:22] thousands but other than that you
[1:09:24] usually don't see a mass conversion like
[1:09:27] this but for some reason God has chosen
[1:09:30] to work amongst the Iranians today and
[1:09:33] so amongst that there's people that are
[1:09:36] receiving the endtime message there's
[1:09:38] people that are hungry for the truth and
[1:09:42] if you want to go on to the next screen
[1:09:46] so I went over I was starting to work
[1:09:49] there I talked about there was a there
[1:09:51] was a group of message believers quote
[1:09:53] unquote message believers they were
[1:09:55] didn't really know much about the
[1:09:56] message they were following Ewald Frank
[1:09:58] so I started working with brother
[1:10:00] Nehemiah
[1:10:01] he's our Trent he's our main translator
[1:10:04] there he's he's done many translations
[1:10:06] and he also does the audio recording of
[1:10:09] translations so he started translating
[1:10:12] the message and he realized that his
[1:10:14] church was not teaching the message and
[1:10:16] so he had many discussions hours and
[1:10:18] hours about this and after my second
[1:10:21] trip right after I had gone full-time I
[1:10:24] was working with him and I told him to
[1:10:26] meet me in a certain place and we'll
[1:10:27] start working with this church there and
[1:10:30] when I got there this other church had
[1:10:34] put a block on everything they told me
[1:10:37] Nehemiah was living a sinful life and he
[1:10:40] couldn't translate for me but they'd
[1:10:43] find it maybe they'd find another
[1:10:45] translator for me and so it was a whole
[1:10:47] political move that happened when I went
[1:10:50] on my first mission missions trip and so
[1:10:52] as a result I separated from those those
[1:10:55] people and stopped working with them and
[1:10:58] basically started from scratch with
[1:11:00] brother Nehemiah he was living in Turkey
[1:11:02] doing the translations and then working
[1:11:05] on evangelizing people and starting
[1:11:09] churches there brother Petros which I'll
[1:11:12] show a picture of each of these brothers
[1:11:14] on the next screen he had just gotten
[1:11:16] out of prison around that time he had
[1:11:18] served a year in prison because of his
[1:11:20] ministry in Iran so he got out and the
[1:11:24] Lord dealt with him and said your
[1:11:27] ministry is finished in Iran moved
[1:11:30] Turkey so then he moved to Turkey he got
[1:11:32] he first he got in contact with me I
[1:11:34] said go go and live with brother
[1:11:36] Nehemiah they were at the time both
[1:11:38] single brothers so go live with him and
[1:11:41] when I come back we'll meet together and
[1:11:43] have to develop a an outreach plan and
[1:11:46] start something well brother Petros is
[1:11:49] is very ambitious and he just
[1:11:53] immediately as soon as he got to Turkey
[1:11:55] started talking to people and right away
[1:11:57] his first time he went went to another
[1:12:00] city he led a Pentecostal pastor and his
[1:12:04] wife to the message and he baptized them
[1:12:08] and then that led to being in contact
[1:12:13] with people all over the place and when
[1:12:16] I came back it wasn't just two people it
[1:12:19] was about 35 people and so I remember
[1:12:24] being after the first trip you're so
[1:12:25] discouraged you think this is how I
[1:12:27] thought it was going to go and now look
[1:12:30] what the results were instead of working
[1:12:31] with multiple churches I've got one guy
[1:12:34] and that's it
[1:12:36] this is terrible and then I come back
[1:12:38] the next time and there's 35 so it was
[1:12:40] good by God's grace so our purpose was
[1:12:44] really to work together as a team and
[1:12:46] spread the message to Iranian people
[1:12:49] living in Turkey establishing churches
[1:12:51] training ministers and kind of
[1:12:53] continuing on with this process as well
[1:12:56] as getting the message in the hands of
[1:12:58] Iranian message believers when we
[1:13:00] started there was no messages on message
[1:13:03] hub we had a website but not a lot of
[1:13:06] people knew about it not a lot of people
[1:13:08] went to it and so it was just it was it
[1:13:12] was spoon feeding them the message soon
[1:13:15] feeding them the message that the Lord
[1:13:17] dealing with us and just bringing
[1:13:20] correction as overtime you know it would
[1:13:24] be easy to go in and say okay look this
[1:13:26] is all the stuff you got messed up and
[1:13:28] here is 75 points for you this is what
[1:13:31] the message is you know you could spend
[1:13:34] you could spend two weeks and never
[1:13:36] sleep and just do that and then
[1:13:38] everybody's overwhelmed then they say oh
[1:13:39] this Jason's and know-it-all what does
[1:13:42] he think yeah
[1:13:43] but the way the Lord dealt with me to do
[1:13:45] it was just drop by drop so each time we
[1:13:48] went back it was the Lord oh this is
[1:13:51] what's the the opening of the word is
[1:13:53] that's what's on my heart let's get him
[1:13:55] to understand revelation 10 and the next
[1:13:58] time I go oh let's let's clarify some
[1:14:00] points on serpent seed let's let's
[1:14:03] clarify some things about Godhead and
[1:14:04] this is kind of how the Lord dealt with
[1:14:06] us let's go into church order the next
[1:14:08] trip and so time went on and you see the
[1:14:12] people getting more established then
[1:14:15] brother Nehemiah continued to translate
[1:14:17] and now we have like 57 messages on the
[1:14:21] message hub there and they download the
[1:14:24] app and they could search the message
[1:14:25] themselves they can put together their
[1:14:27] messages with with being able to see
[1:14:30] what the Prophet himself said instancing
[1:14:32] what did Jason say the Prophet said over
[1:14:34] here or what did what's in this one
[1:14:36] because we recorded a lot of our
[1:14:38] messages on video so that people could
[1:14:41] refer back to them but now they can
[1:14:43] study for themselves this was when we
[1:14:46] first started that was only a dream and
[1:14:48] now the dream is a reality and so if you
[1:14:52] want to go to the next screen on the
[1:14:54] Left there's brother Petros he's the
[1:14:57] he's the brother that spearheaded a lot
[1:14:59] of outreach when he when he went there
[1:15:03] he had an idea to do a Christmas service
[1:15:07] so for Muslims Christmas is very very
[1:15:11] interesting for them they think it's a
[1:15:14] big party and Americans get together and
[1:15:18] they drink and dance and have a good old
[1:15:21] time and so we use this to our advantage
[1:15:23] and through a Christmas party
[1:15:26] and so we give them food and tea and
[1:15:32] then there's music and worship and
[1:15:35] someone giving their testimony and then
[1:15:39] someone coming and and bringing the
[1:15:41] gospel to them and so they set up a
[1:15:45] service in the city of si vas in this
[1:15:48] city there hadn't been a church there
[1:15:49] for over 500 years and so they invited
[1:15:54] about 70 people 150 people
[1:15:57] showed up there to the meetings there
[1:15:59] was Turkish people but mostly Iranian
[1:16:01] that came and 17 people gave their
[1:16:05] hearts to Christ in the meeting and they
[1:16:07] baptized them there in the name of the
[1:16:09] Lord Jesus Christ so that was when I
[1:16:11] came back and a church had been planted
[1:16:15] and started there a pastor had been
[1:16:17] provided by the Lord and just absolutely
[1:16:20] incredible how God did that and then the
[1:16:24] picture on the right there is myself
[1:16:25] preaching and brother Nehemiah
[1:16:27] translating but he's also a preacher and
[1:16:30] teacher as well if you go to the next
[1:16:34] screen we've done in the last six years
[1:16:38] for Persian ministers meetings where we
[1:16:42] brought the ministers together in a
[1:16:44] specific area and and worked with them I
[1:16:46] remember the very first time we had a
[1:16:49] meeting myself and brother Nehemiah and
[1:16:52] brother Petros leading the meeting and
[1:16:54] it was it was the most difficult
[1:16:57] preaching I've ever done because these
[1:17:00] people were trying to get the correct
[1:17:02] biblical church order in place they're
[1:17:05] used to having a bishop that was their
[1:17:07] church they had a bishop and he was in
[1:17:09] control of all the churches in the whole
[1:17:11] country
[1:17:12] and so they they looked at it and their
[1:17:15] South leadership was control control
[1:17:17] control and so I really had to blast
[1:17:20] that approach and get them to look at
[1:17:22] the leadership of the Holy Spirit and
[1:17:26] then we talked about holiness to the
[1:17:27] Lord because it was something that was
[1:17:29] never emphasized maybe one sister would
[1:17:32] walk in holiness and so I was preaching
[1:17:35] this in and it was just tough and as a
[1:17:38] result I think half the ministers
[1:17:39] stopped working with us but it was the
[1:17:42] best thing that ever happened to us
[1:17:43] because it really exposed the Word of
[1:17:46] God discerns the hearts it really
[1:17:50] exposed the motivation of people people
[1:17:53] that were in it for money or whatever
[1:17:55] other reasons they vanish'd the people
[1:17:58] that really had their heart to serve the
[1:18:00] Lord they continued on so we have
[1:18:04] planted four churches there in Turkey
[1:18:07] and working with small groups in three
[1:18:09] additional cities now
[1:18:10] I've done 20 trips total roughly 286
[1:18:15] days I've spent in Turkey and you can
[1:18:18] continue to the next one it's a little
[1:18:23] hard to see but that's kind of where
[1:18:24] churches are in the red and then the
[1:18:27] blue is places where we have believers
[1:18:29] the different cities there the next one
[1:18:35] brother brother Nehemiah was from the
[1:18:38] capital city of Iran Tehran and he grew
[1:18:41] up you know his mother was the second
[1:18:45] second wife not like ex-wife ex-wife but
[1:18:49] literally his dad had three wives and
[1:18:53] his mother was a second wife she was
[1:18:55] abused when he was 16 he finally kicked
[1:18:58] his father out of the house he was
[1:19:00] strong enough to do that and he had
[1:19:03] provided for his family ever since then
[1:19:05] he had two sisters but they were he came
[1:19:10] to a place where he was kind of a
[1:19:11] agnostic and he started searching he
[1:19:14] asked his mother to find him a Bible he
[1:19:15] read the book of Mark he didn't like it
[1:19:17] at all but it was an outreach book and
[1:19:21] he just threw it aside in his home but
[1:19:22] then his mother read it and the Lord
[1:19:24] gave her a dream she sought Jesus saying
[1:19:27] I am the way the truth and the life she
[1:19:29] repented came to Christ then as then as
[1:19:33] a month later his older sister had the
[1:19:36] exam exact experience read the book had
[1:19:38] the dream gave her heart to the Lord and
[1:19:41] then the youngest sister the same
[1:19:43] another two months so nehemiah was
[1:19:45] frustrated I corrupted my family he says
[1:19:48] and I want to turn this guy that led
[1:19:51] them to Christ into the into the
[1:19:53] government so they said do you want to
[1:19:56] meet with them yes I do and he went and
[1:19:57] he listened to the guy tell about
[1:19:59] serpent seed and the gospel and he said
[1:20:01] this is the most logical thing I ever
[1:20:03] heard in my life
[1:20:04] and but said he was resistant again
[1:20:08] against it over time he at the end of
[1:20:10] this the pastor told him said pray God
[1:20:14] can speak to you ask him to reveal
[1:20:16] himself and so he was one time he was he
[1:20:20] was praying and hear a voice say it's
[1:20:23] hard for you to kick
[1:20:24] against the goads he thought what in the
[1:20:26] world does that mean
[1:20:27] he'd never read that before he didn't
[1:20:29] even have the book of X so he called the
[1:20:31] minister and they met and he just opened
[1:20:34] in the scripture and said this is where
[1:20:35] it is the book of Acts means you're
[1:20:37] resisting God is calling you and you're
[1:20:39] resisting him and he broke down in tears
[1:20:42] and gave his heart to the Lord
[1:20:43] and he grew he grew up he had just a
[1:20:46] love for anything American so he
[1:20:49] listened to and he was a worldly kid so
[1:20:51] after after he was fanatic Muslim he
[1:20:53] kept me agnostic then he gave his life
[1:20:56] to watching American movies and
[1:20:59] listening to American rock-and-roll and
[1:21:01] rap music as a result he learned English
[1:21:03] very very well so I think about how God
[1:21:09] works it's just amazing so now he comes
[1:21:13] to the message and just for his own
[1:21:15] pleasure he starts translating brother
[1:21:17] Branham into Farsi then he shows it to
[1:21:20] his pastor and he says who did this well
[1:21:22] I did it this is really good you you
[1:21:25] have a gift
[1:21:26] start translating this was the same time
[1:21:29] I was asking the brother do you have a
[1:21:31] translator that could help us because we
[1:21:34] need to get the message into people's
[1:21:35] hands he was like well I'll talk to them
[1:21:38] some of the brothers inside the country
[1:21:40] yes actually there's one he's just
[1:21:42] starting so he started translating and
[1:21:44] not long after that he got arrested he
[1:21:47] was put in prison they they tortured him
[1:21:51] then he got out on bail and he ended up
[1:21:56] we talked to him and said would you pray
[1:21:58] about moving to Turkey you get that way
[1:22:01] you can be safe and you can translate
[1:22:03] full time you don't have to worry about
[1:22:05] someone you going to prison so he prayed
[1:22:08] and he decided that he would go to
[1:22:11] Turkey and so that was where that that
[1:22:13] was who met us at the airport on our
[1:22:15] first trip with my wife and father and
[1:22:19] mother-in-law in 2011 and so we've been
[1:22:22] really close friends ever since then you
[1:22:25] want to go on to the next one kind of
[1:22:30] covered this already but we have 34
[1:22:33] voiceover audio translations in addition
[1:22:36] to the 57 trends
[1:22:38] translations we have in printed format
[1:22:41] and so it's a that has been tremendous
[1:22:46] because people are very very busy
[1:22:48] especially in Turkey they work they
[1:22:51] they're not allowed to work legally so
[1:22:53] they work illegally and they end up
[1:22:54] working 14 16 hour days and so the only
[1:22:59] way they really can listen to the
[1:23:00] message is by put feet on the messages
[1:23:02] by putting in their earphones while
[1:23:04] they're at work and listening and so
[1:23:07] it's just been a tremendous tremendous
[1:23:09] blessing sisters while they're doing
[1:23:11] their housework they're listening to the
[1:23:14] message so it's been awesome going to
[1:23:17] the next one just March of this year
[1:23:19] that Church ages book has been
[1:23:22] translated another one that was just a
[1:23:24] dream nine years ago you know it's a
[1:23:29] reality and so we're so thankful for
[1:23:31] that that's also on the message hub
[1:23:33] going to the next one and this has been
[1:23:37] a tremendous help the supernatural
[1:23:39] series has been translated actually I
[1:23:42] have almost completed I just got the
[1:23:44] email on on yesterday that book six is
[1:23:50] completed so it's all done just book
[1:23:53] five and six need to get printed and put
[1:23:55] into the hands of the people but it's
[1:23:56] just that has been tremendous to show
[1:23:59] the strength of vindication in the life
[1:24:02] of brother Branham it's really shown the
[1:24:05] people that reality and given them a
[1:24:07] balance before all they got was what
[1:24:11] other people told them what their
[1:24:14] preachers told them and so a lot of
[1:24:16] times they would use things from brother
[1:24:18] branham's life to manipulate and control
[1:24:21] them well they can't do that anymore
[1:24:24] because now they now that now from
[1:24:26] beginning to end it's all there in the
[1:24:29] supernatural series if you go onto the
[1:24:32] next one and we're gonna skip that go to
[1:24:37] the next sorry so this is a couple in
[1:24:42] their 70s that we met with several years
[1:24:45] ago brother Nehemiah and I had been
[1:24:48] visiting people in their homes
[1:24:50] all day long and this couple wanted to
[1:24:53] beat us and was coming was calling us
[1:24:56] constantly when can you come when you
[1:24:58] come finally it was one o'clock when we
[1:25:00] were done with the last people on our
[1:25:03] list and they were next and so we
[1:25:05] finally called they they had called an
[1:25:06] hour earlier so we called them and said
[1:25:08] sorry it's so late we'll just meet you
[1:25:10] tomorrow and they said no no no we want
[1:25:13] to we don't we're not gonna go to the
[1:25:15] bed until we hear the gospel and so we
[1:25:19] went there and Nehemiah and I shared the
[1:25:21] time and spoke to them about the plan of
[1:25:25] salvation about serpent seed why it had
[1:25:28] to be blood and then and brought them
[1:25:31] the gospel and they said do you have any
[1:25:34] questions and they came and got on their
[1:25:35] knees and said we want to repent and
[1:25:37] receive Jesus Christ
[1:25:39] and so we got down on our knees with
[1:25:42] them as well and and prayed with them
[1:25:44] and they received Christ and then their
[1:25:46] very first question that they asked
[1:25:48] after that was when we go back to Iran
[1:25:51] will we be killed right away and I was
[1:25:54] so shocked at this because they didn't
[1:25:56] ask it before receiving Christ they
[1:26:00] didn't count the cost beforehand they
[1:26:02] said I would want to receive Christ
[1:26:03] now that we've received Christ's will
[1:26:05] this happen well we said no of course
[1:26:07] not as they're mostly looking for
[1:26:09] ministers but just pray and use wisdom
[1:26:12] and be a witness as the Holy Spirit
[1:26:15] leads you and so they were brother
[1:26:19] Petros and brother Nehemiah returned
[1:26:21] after that a few days later and baptize
[1:26:23] them in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:26:24] Christ so we don't know anything what's
[1:26:27] happened to him that we know they were
[1:26:28] there back in Iran living there and
[1:26:30] that's it but I know that God's hand is
[1:26:33] in their life amen
[1:26:34] next screen it's a few of our churches
[1:26:38] there on the right one is the top one is
[1:26:40] there in the city of Deniz Lee so Deniz
[1:26:44] Lee is actually the replacement city for
[1:26:46] Laodicea Laodicea was restore destroyed
[1:26:50] by earthquake four different times
[1:26:52] finally after the fourth time they said
[1:26:54] this is probably not the greatest place
[1:26:56] to have a city
[1:26:57] let's move it further down the river so
[1:27:00] they moved it further down the river and
[1:27:01] they changed the name to
[1:27:02] the city of Deniz Lee it actually Deniz
[1:27:05] Lee means Laodicea on the lake so if
[1:27:13] you're wondering there is a message
[1:27:16] Church in the city of Laodicea amen
[1:27:22] sometimes we wonder if some churches are
[1:27:24] in Laodicea and maybe they are but
[1:27:26] there's literally a Church in Laodicea
[1:27:28] and then the other the other church
[1:27:32] there on the bottom is in the city of
[1:27:34] Sivas Turkey has more in in central
[1:27:37] Turkey next screen this is a group of
[1:27:41] ministers at our ministers meeting I
[1:27:43] think in 2016 that we had in the city of
[1:27:48] Esparta and this was a year after we had
[1:27:53] a ministers meeting that was so
[1:27:54] difficult and this was a very very good
[1:27:56] one because it was just filled with
[1:27:58] people eager and desirous to feed on the
[1:28:01] Word of God
[1:28:02] next one brother Petros performing some
[1:28:07] baptisms there in in Turkey next and
[1:28:13] this is a lot of what we do you see
[1:28:15] there brother Petros is preaching to the
[1:28:18] people answering questions in their home
[1:28:21] we really spend a lot of time doing that
[1:28:24] going into people's homes and teaching
[1:28:27] them and answering their questions and
[1:28:28] as a tremendous impact there there he is
[1:28:35] at the bottom one he's introducing the
[1:28:37] the church ages to the church there in
[1:28:41] the city of Adana
[1:28:43] go to the next one again brother Petros
[1:28:48] ministering there different cities
[1:28:50] throughout Turkey also on that bottom
[1:28:53] one he's actually in the city in Germany
[1:28:56] in Hamburg he was a refugee as well and
[1:28:59] so they directed him to live in Germany
[1:29:01] so he started a church there in Hampi
[1:29:05] Iranian church there in Hamburg Germany
[1:29:06] and then he travels back every few
[1:29:08] months for a week two weeks three weeks
[1:29:11] to Turkey to minister to the churches
[1:29:14] and do outreach there on to the next one
[1:29:17] it's brother cave on whether cave on is
[1:29:19] a tremendous evangelist he when he was
[1:29:23] living in in in Iran for about thirteen
[1:29:27] years he was a Christian there and he
[1:29:30] said he led about a thousand people to
[1:29:31] Christ personally in Iran so he came he
[1:29:37] came to a one of our ministers meetings
[1:29:39] while he was still living in Iran he
[1:29:40] left the country and flew to the
[1:29:42] minister's meeting and when he got back
[1:29:46] there they knew that he was in the
[1:29:48] minister's meeting even though he didn't
[1:29:49] publish it we put nothing on online
[1:29:52] about him they knew he was there and
[1:29:55] that was the beginning of his
[1:29:56] persecution you can actually I don't
[1:29:58] know if you mentioned the book but
[1:30:00] there's a book I wrote called Persia
[1:30:02] unveiled I think I think the the the DVD
[1:30:07] or the the video was sent out before but
[1:30:11] there's also a book and it goes into
[1:30:13] details about people's testimonies and
[1:30:16] so this brother Kavon is one of them and
[1:30:18] he he started under persecution got
[1:30:20] arrested after that eventually desired
[1:30:23] to leave leave Iran and went to Turkey
[1:30:26] and he went and started a church from
[1:30:29] scratch in the city of Esparta and this
[1:30:32] is a baptismal on the top one he
[1:30:34] baptized forty five people in the name
[1:30:36] of the Lord Jesus Christ and just a
[1:30:39] tremendous job of evangelizing people
[1:30:42] you'd never think he was because he's so
[1:30:43] quiet when you get together with him he
[1:30:47] barely talks but when it comes to
[1:30:49] evangelizing he's just he knows how to
[1:30:52] do it next one this is brother Shahin he
[1:30:58] he has been in the message for twenty
[1:31:00] years
[1:31:01] quote unquote the message for twenty
[1:31:03] years he moved in 2014 to Turkey after
[1:31:08] he'd been arrested several times in Iran
[1:31:10] he and his family did first time we met
[1:31:14] him we spent hours and hours and hours
[1:31:17] speaking just about the basics of the
[1:31:19] message at the end of it he said in this
[1:31:22] one day I learned more about the message
[1:31:24] than I did in all twenty years that I've
[1:31:26] been in the message inside of Iran
[1:31:29] so he knew just so-so very little and
[1:31:34] now today he's a tremendous teacher of
[1:31:37] the message he's really learned it very
[1:31:41] well the brothers have started brother
[1:31:44] Shahin or the nehemiah brother Petros
[1:31:47] and and the next brother that I'll talk
[1:31:48] about brother Omid have done a great job
[1:31:50] they've started a Facebook live video
[1:31:55] that they do on a consistent basis
[1:31:57] they started out by just doing short
[1:31:59] five-minute clips
[1:32:01] talking about just simple simple
[1:32:04] doctrines of the message and then
[1:32:06] building that and then they started
[1:32:07] doing 30-minute videos every day and so
[1:32:11] it was kind of the purpose was to get
[1:32:12] almost every subject of the message
[1:32:14] spoken of just in a basic basis and then
[1:32:18] put on to a website so that people could
[1:32:20] go and buy subject look up everything
[1:32:23] and so they they've done that and this
[1:32:28] has had a tremendous impact because it's
[1:32:29] going into people in Iran people inside
[1:32:32] of Iran are getting a hold of these
[1:32:33] videos and they're leaving that other
[1:32:36] message denominational group and they're
[1:32:39] following the truth people are
[1:32:41] requesting books and things it's very
[1:32:43] difficult to get books inside there we
[1:32:46] just say go to the message hub get those
[1:32:48] print them if you can oh go to go to our
[1:32:53] website listen to the audio and brother
[1:32:56] Shahin has been a tremendous part of
[1:32:58] doing that and actually he's come down
[1:33:00] to he's kind of the main one that will
[1:33:03] do the videos on a weekly basis and
[1:33:05] actually he's gonna be our voice
[1:33:07] recording the supernatural series so
[1:33:09] he's just reading it off so that will
[1:33:11] people will have that in audio format
[1:33:13] you want to go into the next one
[1:33:15] brother Omid is baptizing people in Lake
[1:33:19] Vaughn this is like 40 minutes from the
[1:33:21] Iranian border so way way far east
[1:33:24] Turkey and he's done a tremendous job
[1:33:27] with evangelism but he also does he's
[1:33:30] the one that edits all those videos and
[1:33:32] he does graphic design web design and
[1:33:36] now the Holy Spirit is leading him to
[1:33:39] move to another city to work and do
[1:33:41] outreach and establish a church
[1:33:42] in that new city so one to the next one
[1:33:47] brother only administering there and
[1:33:49] that top right one is one brother
[1:33:51] Nehemiah and I laid hands on him and
[1:33:53] ordained him as a as a minister there
[1:33:57] next just some more pictures of services
[1:34:03] and praying over people that wanted to
[1:34:06] come to Christ next one
[1:34:10] we had a mystery Expo in the city of a
[1:34:12] Sparta that's where the Kavon is the
[1:34:14] pastor and all in all to all the
[1:34:17] meetings we had I think we had six
[1:34:22] services and about a hundred and fifty
[1:34:25] people total came to all of them you
[1:34:28] want to go to the next one brother Omid
[1:34:35] translated for me it's interesting we
[1:34:37] we'd always use brother brother
[1:34:40] Nehemiah as a translator and we were
[1:34:42] always praying for a new translator well
[1:34:44] on this trip brother Nehemiah was
[1:34:46] supposed to meet me there but he didn't
[1:34:48] get his visa in time and so here I was
[1:34:51] there without a translator and brother
[1:34:52] Omid was like why I know English pretty
[1:34:55] well I could translate for you just we
[1:34:57] have to meet and discuss what you're
[1:34:59] preaching about but I'll translate
[1:35:00] so he started I was so nervous using a
[1:35:03] different translator but it he did a
[1:35:05] pretty good job and and since then he's
[1:35:07] really improved his English and now he
[1:35:10] can translate very very well and does a
[1:35:13] great job so the Lord really forced our
[1:35:15] hand into using a different translator
[1:35:17] and it's been a blessing ever since then
[1:35:20] so if you go onto the next one as a
[1:35:24] result of the meetings there was 14
[1:35:26] people that wanted to be baptized in the
[1:35:28] name of the Lord Jesus Christ that
[1:35:30] picture in the upper right corner it's
[1:35:32] interesting in the Sunday morning
[1:35:33] service before the service start a woman
[1:35:37] came in from the Assemblies of God
[1:35:38] Church in the in the town and she comes
[1:35:41] and meets the brothers at the back desk
[1:35:43] and saw it there was we had books of
[1:35:44] brother Branham and a few pictures of
[1:35:46] him and she said where where is that man
[1:35:48] and they said oh he's passed away many
[1:35:51] years ago but that's God's prophet
[1:35:55] he said no no when I came in the
[1:35:57] building he used the one that greeted me
[1:36:00] they said it looks Junger than that but
[1:36:04] that's that's who greeted me when I came
[1:36:06] in and so he were shocked and so I made
[1:36:10] her tell me that testimony again and
[1:36:13] just to us it was such a vindication
[1:36:16] that the endtime essage was coming to
[1:36:18] that city amen
[1:36:20] and so she she immediately went and took
[1:36:24] all the books that she could and even
[1:36:26] started reading them while the service
[1:36:27] was going on because she was so excited
[1:36:30] if you want to go into the next one I
[1:36:32] think you press it again you'll see a
[1:36:35] video come up start you hit a spacebar I
[1:36:44] think
[1:36:59] if not that's alright yeah we'll just go
[1:37:05] on to the next one this was from our
[1:37:08] ministers meeting in 2018 in in May so
[1:37:14] we had some ministers from a few other
[1:37:16] churches come and sit with us and they
[1:37:20] they very much enjoyed the ministry of
[1:37:25] the word and they received the word
[1:37:26] though there there some several of them
[1:37:29] are in a condition where they're afraid
[1:37:31] to leave their denomination or their
[1:37:33] church and so they're just in the
[1:37:35] process of gathering up strengths and we
[1:37:38] pray pray for them and hope the Lord
[1:37:40] delivers them from their denomination
[1:37:42] didn't get out of that one to the next
[1:37:45] one
[1:37:45] it's another visit we had and in this
[1:37:48] home with these believers it's just a
[1:37:50] very interesting format it took on
[1:37:53] because we went and said do you have any
[1:37:54] questions and usually when you do that
[1:37:56] to started the blue people like well
[1:37:59] yeah we do but they're afraid to ask
[1:38:01] them so Shahin was there sitting next to
[1:38:04] me and we asked and they were quiet and
[1:38:06] then brother shining just started asking
[1:38:09] me that well here's the questions I
[1:38:10] think they would ask you and so she's
[1:38:13] wearing earrings and he says brother
[1:38:15] Jason is there anything in the message
[1:38:17] or the Bible about earrings and I was
[1:38:19] just like oh is this how we're gonna do
[1:38:21] that
[1:38:22] and so I just started speaking about
[1:38:25] what the scripture says referring that's
[1:38:27] opening our Bible here this is what the
[1:38:29] Prophet says oh wow I didn't know it
[1:38:32] they were very thankful what about
[1:38:33] cutting the hair what is there anything
[1:38:36] can we trim the hair is that okay so
[1:38:38] Shahin is just doing this whole
[1:38:39] question-and-answer thing just basically
[1:38:42] I want you to teach these people this
[1:38:44] okay that's pretty much what it was but
[1:38:45] it ended up working very well they
[1:38:48] received it very well and really
[1:38:50] rejoiced in it so go ahead and go on to
[1:38:53] the next one this is preaching in the
[1:38:57] city of Esparta brother Kevin has gone
[1:39:00] through the process a few different
[1:39:02] times where we've spoken to him and said
[1:39:04] you got to introduce them to the message
[1:39:06] right away he wants to get them to the
[1:39:09] ABCs which I understand
[1:39:11] and just go on the very basic things for
[1:39:14] six months seven months but then he goes
[1:39:16] through that process he gets to the end
[1:39:18] and now he starts talking about a profit
[1:39:21] and the people are like I don't know if
[1:39:24] I wanted to get into this what is this
[1:39:26] all about
[1:39:27] and then three quarters of the church
[1:39:29] leaves and then he does outreach again
[1:39:31] and he keeps going through this process
[1:39:33] finally on this last trip I said where
[1:39:35] the Kavon we've been after you for this
[1:39:37] don't you see exactly what happening is
[1:39:41] what we warned you was going to happen
[1:39:43] because we learned the hard way
[1:39:44] ourselves jut you've got to just be open
[1:39:47] with people right away about the message
[1:39:50] get them to the basic things of why
[1:39:53] we're not Trinitarians why how what we
[1:39:56] believe about the Godhead teach them
[1:39:59] about the church ages just go right into
[1:40:01] it yes of course we need to go through
[1:40:04] the ABCs with them as well but you can't
[1:40:07] put the message off six seven eight
[1:40:09] months because the people just walk away
[1:40:11] so finally it was revealed for him this
[1:40:15] time and so he's he's now been teaching
[1:40:18] on the message and holiness and now he's
[1:40:22] going into a long series about why the
[1:40:24] Trinity is false and the truth of the
[1:40:26] Godhead and just really doing a
[1:40:28] tremendous job there and the people have
[1:40:31] received it they're not running away
[1:40:32] this time so we thank the Lord for that
[1:40:34] but on this trip I went into those
[1:40:37] people that had been new I the message I
[1:40:40] have called what is the message it's
[1:40:42] just a overview introduction of the
[1:40:46] message and they loved it they really
[1:40:48] received it well next screen I can't say
[1:40:54] the name of the country that this is in
[1:40:57] because it's being streamed it'll be
[1:40:59] online but another country in the Middle
[1:41:02] East the door is opened and we're
[1:41:05] starting to work with them they speak
[1:41:07] the Arabic language and the Lord has
[1:41:10] provided a translator we've got eight
[1:41:12] chapter nine chapters of the church
[1:41:15] Aegis book translated and there's
[1:41:18] someone that's helping us with editing
[1:41:20] and getting those uploaded to the
[1:41:22] message hub as well
[1:41:24] and we we went there this was my first
[1:41:27] trip there in August and introduced the
[1:41:34] message to them and they really were
[1:41:37] rejoicing in it
[1:41:38] seven people basically all the adults
[1:41:41] that hadn't been rebaptised got
[1:41:43] rebaptised as a result of the meetings I
[1:41:46] was there with brother Marcus Becker
[1:41:49] from Germany as well and he ministers
[1:41:52] also go to the next screen see Egyptian
[1:41:56] brother that's living in Germany was
[1:42:00] there with us he speaks Arabic well and
[1:42:03] he he was baptizing the people one of
[1:42:06] the next one I said we're working on
[1:42:09] translating and then we hope to get it
[1:42:12] printed hopefully in the springtime and
[1:42:15] in Arabic we're translating some
[1:42:18] outreach tracks as well and we've got to
[1:42:20] go and it's just like the beginning of
[1:42:22] working with the Iranians we got a spoon
[1:42:23] feed them the message because they don't
[1:42:25] have access to very much of it if you go
[1:42:28] to the next one and we'll continue to
[1:42:32] work on the translations in both
[1:42:34] languages continue to work with the
[1:42:37] pastors and the mission team in each of
[1:42:41] these countries we those pastors are
[1:42:44] also refugees finances are very
[1:42:46] difficult for them so we with by God's
[1:42:49] grace and with his help we help support
[1:42:51] them and then as they feel lad they'll
[1:42:53] take missions trips and as we're able to
[1:42:56] we help them with those trips we pay for
[1:42:59] some of their church rent typically
[1:43:01] there it's it's really tough to find an
[1:43:04] actual there's no church buildings
[1:43:05] really so for there we have to rent an
[1:43:08] apartment and kind of turn it turn its
[1:43:11] living room into a church and bedroom
[1:43:15] into an office and that kind of thing
[1:43:18] and we do outreach there and we'll
[1:43:20] probably start doing more outreach in in
[1:43:23] the other Arabic country as well so if
[1:43:26] you'd keep us in prayer we'd appreciate
[1:43:28] I think that's the greatest thing that
[1:43:29] we need this is a this is a spiritual
[1:43:32] warfare that we're facing we're going
[1:43:35] into a place that the devil has a strong
[1:43:38] and I think you know I can say every
[1:43:41] time I go Satan is just battling you
[1:43:45] wonder why am I doing this you start
[1:43:48] it's just a battle in the mind that
[1:43:50] begins to take place you see you know
[1:43:52] you step back and you see how God has
[1:43:54] worked but when you're in the middle of
[1:43:56] it you know you feel beaten down then
[1:44:00] when I went to the new country the first
[1:44:02] time I got there and so we got there in
[1:44:06] the middle of the night then they wanted
[1:44:08] to take us to show us some seats scenic
[1:44:12] spots in the country and it was like
[1:44:15] 7:00 in the morning so I got two hours
[1:44:16] of sleep and we come back after that it
[1:44:18] was so unbelievably hot and I've been
[1:44:21] sweating since I arrived in the country
[1:44:23] I remember thinking I just want to go
[1:44:25] home I texted my wife I'm gonna book a
[1:44:27] ticket I'm just I'm just coming home I
[1:44:28] can't do this anymore she's like just
[1:44:31] just pray did you pray about that like
[1:44:35] brother branham's wife would tell him do
[1:44:37] you pray about that no I don't want to
[1:44:40] pray about it because I just want to
[1:44:41] come home she said I want you'd get a
[1:44:46] little sleep and pray and you'll be all
[1:44:50] right
[1:44:51] and so you know it's a spiritual battle
[1:44:53] that we're facing and I really need you
[1:44:55] to hold my arms up please do that and if
[1:44:59] musicians if you'd come you know you can
[1:45:03] close out the PowerPoint there the Lord
[1:45:09] is working we want to go home right but
[1:45:11] we got to find that last predestinated
[1:45:13] seed and I believe there's this message
[1:45:17] has to be preached in all nations so
[1:45:18] then the end will come and so we've got
[1:45:21] some nations that we've got to reach to
[1:45:23] especially in the Middle East and many
[1:45:26] other places as well but Lord send
[1:45:28] laborers into the field what our prayer
[1:45:31] is and I love that earlier in the
[1:45:34] service that brother said we need to
[1:45:37] pray for lost souls because that I mean
[1:45:41] really if you look at the way
[1:45:44] immigration and and so forth works the
[1:45:48] world is coming to America
[1:45:50] well that's it's put on hold
[1:45:52] with the new president but even so the
[1:45:56] world has come here we have a tremendous
[1:45:57] opportunity for outreach amongst nations
[1:46:00] that you can't go to but they're here
[1:46:02] think about that for a minute we can
[1:46:05] reach Muslims here that we could never
[1:46:08] even go to their country we'd be killed
[1:46:11] right away to do it and the same thing
[1:46:13] for myself going to Iran I I've never
[1:46:16] been to Iran I couldn't go to Iran they
[1:46:19] there I'm on their lists they've
[1:46:22] interrogated people they've they've
[1:46:23] tortured people to find out information
[1:46:25] about me it would be impossible for me
[1:46:28] to go but the message still is going
[1:46:31] anyways why because there's people that
[1:46:33] are being forced out of the country into
[1:46:36] a country I can go to and then through
[1:46:39] that it's going back to their family
[1:46:41] members it's it's going through the
[1:46:43] internet to people that we could never
[1:46:45] reach which is tremendous you know we as
[1:46:49] all the things that we would have to
[1:46:50] warn ourselves and others about social
[1:46:53] media and yet there's a tremendous means
[1:46:56] of bringing the gospel to places that
[1:46:58] you personally couldn't go amen so let's
[1:47:02] pray father we just delight in you than
[1:47:09] what you've done in this age and Lord
[1:47:12] because of that we just have a passion
[1:47:14] to see this message spread far and wide
[1:47:19] give us boldness and confidence we know
[1:47:22] this is a scriptural message we know
[1:47:25] that there's seed out there that need to
[1:47:26] hear it so lord give us give us a thick
[1:47:30] skin tender hearts but thick skin Lord
[1:47:33] because the the devil is like a roaring
[1:47:35] lion seeking whom he may devour and when
[1:47:38] anytime we want to do something for you
[1:47:40] Lord the devil raises up to try to
[1:47:43] discourage us from that help us to get a
[1:47:48] real vision of what you've called us to
[1:47:50] do how you've called us to reach out
[1:47:53] because that's the thing Lord is there's
[1:47:57] a kingdom that you want to spread
[1:47:59] throughout the whole world
[1:48:01] Satan also wants to spread his kingdom
[1:48:04] throughout
[1:48:05] whole world and he's doing everything he
[1:48:07] can to put us to sleep to bring us to
[1:48:11] this place where we don't share our
[1:48:13] faith but lord let us rise above that
[1:48:17] and be Kingdom builders not our own
[1:48:22] Kingdom but the kingdom of Jesus Christ
[1:48:27] the word Lord we ask that you would in
[1:48:33] everything go before us we ask that you
[1:48:38] would speak to each one here even in a
[1:48:40] new way Lord in a way you've never had
[1:48:42] before and deal with us in a way you
[1:48:46] never have before
[1:48:47] set our hearts on fire for this word we
[1:48:54] ask it in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[1:49:02] can we just worship the Lord let's stand
[1:49:05] up and saying I love you lord

[1:55:27] [Music]
[1:55:35] enjoy that tonight and encouraged
[1:55:41] challenged edified amen amen more to
[1:55:47] pray about amen
[1:55:50] you know it's just so much that in every
[1:55:52] one of your lives our lives as believers
[1:55:55] you know there's everything how God just
[1:55:57] so orchestrates everything and to see
[1:56:00] how God brings everything together
[1:56:02] it's his working and I know that
[1:56:05] sometimes seems like we're statement we
[1:56:07] make so regularly - oh yeah it's God's
[1:56:09] working but God allows us to see things
[1:56:12] even in the smallest of details just
[1:56:16] that brother Jason pointed out tonight
[1:56:18] when you take for example what Satan
[1:56:20] intended I believe for brother
[1:56:22] nehemiah's life getting him all wrapped
[1:56:24] up in that American culture and all
[1:56:26] those are the things like that but when
[1:56:28] he said that I also thought of what
[1:56:29] brother Bryan said in the earlier part
[1:56:31] during the prayer request
[1:56:33] God has Satan's number you see the
[1:56:39] government raised paid for Moses are you
[1:56:43] with me he was right there in Pharaoh's
[1:56:45] house so that's nothing new with there
[1:56:47] on and on we could go with that but you
[1:56:49] see with everything what the enemy meant
[1:56:53] for evil God said I'm gonna take that
[1:56:56] because I already know all of this and
[1:56:58] how that's all gonna work according to
[1:57:01] my plan and my purpose and all my what
[1:57:04] words of life and really he was caught
[1:57:06] up in Psalms he has been ordained by God
[1:57:10] to write this new song translate this
[1:57:15] new song this song of redemption the
[1:57:18] finishing up of the mystery of God oh my
[1:57:22] catching that the transitions and they
[1:57:24] octaves and I tell you God is so good
[1:57:27] he's so good you think about him brother
[1:57:30] branham's life even you know brother
[1:57:31] Branham when he went fishing up there in
[1:57:34] in Michigan right there in the top part
[1:57:36] of Indiana you know brother branham just
[1:57:38] decided to take a turn and he was gonna
[1:57:41] go home a different way and so when
[1:57:43] brother Brennan went home a different
[1:57:44] way he came across this sign in a town
[1:57:47] that talked about a meeting and he seen
[1:57:49] these two men brother Brennan would have
[1:57:51] never went that way
[1:57:52] and what he thought he was just going to
[1:57:54] take a scenic route home it was in line
[1:57:56] with God's plan for his life but the
[1:57:59] Brennan goes on to tell us in Israel in
[1:58:01] the church part five brother Bram talks
[1:58:03] about this man you know I thought about
[1:58:04] this year and I just I got beside myself
[1:58:06] the other day praying I thought about
[1:58:08] this black man that's all we know him as
[1:58:10] a black man with a rim around his his
[1:58:12] head I don't know his name but on the
[1:58:15] other side I said Lord I'm gonna meet
[1:58:17] that man I'm gonna meet that man that
[1:58:19] stood there in that convention and
[1:58:21] brother Bram says it was that man these
[1:58:24] big exact words brother brems says he
[1:58:26] said it was that man he said that I seen
[1:58:28] the Holy Ghost manifesting and I knew
[1:58:30] there's something that I was missing in
[1:58:32] my life and that's what it was see it's
[1:58:36] what was manifesting he had the Bible he
[1:58:38] had been reading that he knew that but
[1:58:40] now see God had a way of manifesting all
[1:58:43] if that in itself don't grip a hold of
[1:58:45] our lives what God's desire is that this
[1:58:48] the real gospel is a manifestation it's
[1:58:51] looking for lives to be lived
[1:58:54] may God help us amen may God help us
[1:58:58] like Ray have been this hour we are in a
[1:59:00] closing moment and we look at it you
[1:59:03] know and and what God is how God is
[1:59:05] using brother Jason over there and the
[1:59:07] other brothers and moving around it's
[1:59:09] it's the Lord how God is doing it you
[1:59:12] even hear the part of it that I think
[1:59:13] was I'm glad that brother Jason shared
[1:59:15] that part that you look at it and you
[1:59:18] see what you see on the slides but to
[1:59:21] see the battles that goes on it's not
[1:59:25] something of a vacation it's not
[1:59:26] something that he wants to do as far as
[1:59:29] it's just something you just want to do
[1:59:31] but it's a burden you cannot get away
[1:59:33] from and that's the way it is within any
[1:59:37] gift and any calling it's a burden it's
[1:59:39] not something you want to do it's a
[1:59:41] burden you can
[1:59:42] away from her and to see that part the
[1:59:45] human they had part of it and how the
[1:59:47] enemy would come and attack you know
[1:59:49] this is where that we are so lift one
[1:59:51] another up in prayer and to know that
[1:59:53] within it all its God
[1:59:55] it's God God is achieving what would
[2:00:00] look like to be impossible to think
[2:00:01] about that I I just amazed there in that
[2:00:04] part where when brother Jason read that
[2:00:08] in 1st Peter chapter 1 verse 1 and to
[2:00:11] see the gospel going right back into
[2:00:13] that same area oh my I say it to God be
[2:00:17] the glory
[2:00:18] you know I don't here's the thing you we
[2:00:21] hear these things and even as brother
[2:00:23] Branham mentioned that about harder to a
[2:00:25] hard to Windham when a Muslim but you
[2:00:27] know what in winning soul for Christ is
[2:00:31] not about how much knowledge or can you
[2:00:33] outdo them in your thinking can you
[2:00:37] bring to a reality the grace of God that
[2:00:41] they can be free if that can touch their
[2:00:45] life that this one who made the way that
[2:00:48] I can be free and when that's made real
[2:00:51] they can walk free no matter what it is
[2:00:54] I tell you it's just it's it's wonderful
[2:00:56] to see what God is doing isn't it and
[2:00:59] you think those need to apply this here
[2:01:01] within our lives in our hearts there
[2:01:04] might be areas and parts in your life
[2:01:06] where God is dealing with and just
[2:01:09] remember there's no area that is
[2:01:12] off-limits to God there is nothing
[2:01:16] within any family or whatever more that
[2:01:19] God cannot reach and that His grace is
[2:01:23] not sufficient to overthrow it he is
[2:01:26] faithful don't you love him Amen let's
[2:01:30] just I tell you what even on the Tuesday

[2:01:34] keep and also not just in Tuesday's but

[2:03:19] spiritual prison and I uttered those
[2:03:22] words set the captives free Lords set
[2:03:26] them free that they might be able to

[2:03:59] back into the jungles of Guyana and back
[2:04:02] in there there was a village and the
[2:04:06] minister there woke up very early in the
[2:04:09] morning four or five o'clock in the
[2:04:11] morning and heard a low noise there in
[2:04:15] the camp or in the village he was asking
[2:04:19] what is this sound that I'm hearing says
[2:04:21] oh brother that's the people waking up
