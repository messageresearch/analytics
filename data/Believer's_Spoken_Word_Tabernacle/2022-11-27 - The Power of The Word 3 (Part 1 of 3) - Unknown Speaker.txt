ourselves to you in this congregation Lord may you be glorified in all things we pray Jesus precious name amen wood he would turn with me to Romans chapter 12. and I want to say it's just so good to be together here again and to be with a man with each and every one and we just um just looking to the Lord just for wonderful things among us I certainly want to say I know you had just a wonderful service here on Sunday and I'll tell you God is just so mindful and none of our needs and just so appreciate that and brother Nathan just yielding him just stepping aside and um we just so thank the Lord for that and I just thank you for your prayers as we had say travels there has just this wonderful meetings there and God just moving in a very very special way among his children and um I know that he came to meet many needs and I'm just grateful just to have been a witness to that amen when he comes and what he does Amen because he's still he's still the same amen let's just read just a couple scriptures and we're just going to let you have your seats then in verse 1 I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that ye present your bodies give me just a little bit more on these monitors up here that ye present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service be not conformed to this world but be it transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God I want you to notice this here again be not conformed to this world but be it transformed by the renewing of your mind for what purpose that ye may prove what is that good acceptable and perfect will of God to prove is to declare it to show it for that's great so to see that God has ordained that his children in this hour will be The Proving Grounds of his word his children are those of whom he will declare himself to be alive and well you see we his children are the you that was spoken of in Malachi 4 and verse 5. not who we try to fit into the you but are you in that verse are you with me now it's behold I send unto you it's not us placing ourselves there it's God that is placing us there is that right yeah it's no person pushed us or pulled us to where we are right now that's why many times we can even get in our own self we get frustrated about things and coming back to like brother Brown was asked a question in the message um uh he's in that little house meeting in the message thy house down in Tifton and brother Branham if you believe the coming of the Lord is so right upon us how in the world can you go fishing and brother Brahm says I learned a long time ago there's only so many names that's on that book and God will not lose one God will not lose one amen so be you transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God may God bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated just just invite him you'll just come and just speak to our hearts this morning we've been speaking on a thought on the power of the word really the basis of that really where a lot as we think about is receiving the word into ourselves into our lives and to know that as brother Brandon would say in different places in perfect faith and say it in Christ is the mystery and it's a statement that as a message believer that no doubt would be common to us and he would say as you receive the word you become the word so we we recognize that within that thought there is a power within the word of God to transform there's the power within the word to bring about just what God has said and remember God interprets his word by bringing it to past good many there's a lot of things when the word is spoken that then as it's late here on printed page that there can be many interpretations rise such as it was Behold a virgin shall conceive many interpretations arose upon that many interpretations arose upon the Messiah coming but that didn't stop God from fulfilling his word God came and fulfilled his word and God wasn't worried one bit of oh my goodness with all this false that's gone out my my my my true seed they're not going to catch this no the only thing that his seed need is for that light to come upon them when he reveals himself it breaks all Superstition it breaks all false interpretations his light and that's why his light it's his life it's him so when we look at this of transformed it is to change into another form or to transform or transfigure it's something that's been changed something that's changed from one thing to another the same word is what it speaks of what took place on Mount in Matthew 17 verse 1. and after six days can I have a little bit more in these monitors please and after six days Jesus taketh Peter James and John his brother as the yes Peter didn't know what was going on but he knew something Supernatural is taking place it's good for us to be here and here's where Peter says if thou wilt let us make here three Tabernacles now I want to just say this to you that that in itself the let us is what has caused many confusions and even confusion in our own life God does not need anyone to make him a tabernacle when he said in the scriptures let them make me a tabernacle what he was calling for his hearts that would surrender what he had already put in their possession to surrender he had the pattern
