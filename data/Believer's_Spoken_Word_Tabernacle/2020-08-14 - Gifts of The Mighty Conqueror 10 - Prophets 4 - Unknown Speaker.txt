tonight lord through your word oh god help me to get out of the way lord just to be just a vessel lord that you would use lord and hear through us lord we pray lord we love you and we thank you tonight in the precious name of the lord jesus christ amen amen amen let's look in the word of the lord here tonight i want to read back in ephesians 4 we're just going to read one verse of scripture verse 11 and then we'll let you have your seeds there are the gifts of the mighty conqueror and i'd like to just look at that in verse 11 of ephesians 4 and he gave some apostles and some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers whatever god provides is because we have needham god just doesn't um he just doesn't send things or or give things just to be given but it's for it's our for our provision so we want to look at that a little bit tonight a little bit more on that of prophets and just ask the lord that he will just have his way and move among us in a special way tonight amen may god bless you the manager of being seated this right here when we look at this i know we've already been speaking multiple services on this and there's going to be multiple more because every time i keep going and trying to cut away at a little bit more there's just things that just continue to further stand out and just to even get it to a place to where we're looking at it for our day uh i know that we have young ones we have as far as young people there's uh some that are new to the lord as well too and and i just trust that not only for them but it'll be a benefit to all of our lives because um even as i've been going through this as the lord's been opening it no i've just been having a jubilee myself and you know that's how the word of the lord is it's not something that if you're if you're still looking at the word and you know it's not that we see something different it's that there's more depth to it that you begin to see more to it and that's the word of god that's the promise that jesus said is that you begin to bring out of that treasure things both old and new and the word of god it makes us rejoice because we are seeing something that we are a part of and to recognize what god has done and that our eyes would be open and our lives have been changed that is that is something that's just so precious to our hearts so when we look at this with a prophet as we have been looking here in the scriptures we know many times that you you we come into people that will say well you know god doesn't have prophets anymore and yet we see that in the new testament as we looked at it that indeed uh god did and does have prophets and we recognize that how the spirit of god would come even in this hour and begin to restore these things to you and i so that we could see brother brannon would make it clear he says that every preacher is a prophet now what he's what he was dealing with is the spirit of god he says when he comes and anoints that man and that man is speaking under divine inspiration of god and he's forth telling the word is is is being ministered but yet we recognize that there are indeed as every prophet is is um every preacher is a prophet but and that scripture would apply even with that and we think of agabus and we think of others but what we have begun to look at here i don't know maybe it's been the past couple services but looking at when god would send a major a prophet and this is not just a an ordinary preacher but it is a man that is specially built with a gift in his life and to be able to recognize what that means and i think of it as young people and many that could sit around sometimes the terminology in these things and i i trust that it's not terminology but to understand that sometimes we hear these words and we can just begin to take it for granted and not just young people but some of you maybe that have sat here and been around the word for many years and yet to you it's still a mystery on what it what is this about a prophet and and what is you know with brother branham as we look at that and recognize that to be god's promise in his word that he would send a prophet in this hour to take us back bring us back to the faith uh the original faith that was given there by god himself on the day of pentecost these are not things that we are to take lightly but is to recognize that with all of this that when we we think of it a prophet is also one who is a seer and one who is seer meaning that that god gives that man sight that goes beyond his natural sight uh there are things that you and i can you and you could take your bible open your bible and read your bible and you could see god said this he said this he said not to do this and not to do that and in reality we ought to be giving ourselves to that because there are things that god has laid out in his word that you don't need anybody to come and reveal it to you paul let me give you an example paul would say regarding your sanctification in your walk with god he said concerning that this is the will of god and you know what god's will is you see there are things that god has laid out in his word that it doesn't take something breaking forth for us to be able to do uh to say oh my but it does take the inspiration of the spirit of god to actually make that word real to us and that our hearts would become a place of betting ground that that word that we're reading can be find its place in fertile ground and be moved from just a seed to an actual manifestation of that word and that's all god's working because it takes god to come on the scene and to break up the stony ground the stony heart it takes god to come on the scene and to give you a new spirit because your old spirit you couldn't even get along with yourself and then it takes him what is he doing preparing his dwelling place in your life that he might come and set down in the midst of your life it's god preparing his own way he's jehovah jireh so when we see this as a prophet is one who is a seer a divine interpreter of the word they're a sign so it is it is where where where uh men have gotten off and the teachings and they just get off on teachings it would be just like you going on a roadway on a trip and then you get off of the pathway or the route and yet you think well i'm heading to this destination you would tell everybody we're going to this destination but you know how it is if you get off the route you're not going to that destination tell a little story about myself here just happened i hate bypasses i hate them because bypasses my mind they're always playing with my mind do i go south on it do i go north on it do i go east on it do i go west on it how am i going to connect with it i've always hated bypasses well this time when we were we took just a few days at the end of last week and here you know we're just driving along you know and i'm listening you know we're listening to the supernatural series you know brother branham we're just going along and i'm just meditating on that and meditating on things i've been studying and just going along and i said why am i seeing signs that are talking about zanesville jamesville ain't towards jeffersonville zainswell here's another is going the direction towards cambridge so what did i have to do i had to come to the next place and turn around and go back and come back a little bit on 70 get back on 270 and then come back around after that really didn't change my mind about bypasses either it won the bypasses fault it was my fault my point within all that is that do we there is a desired destination if you would talk to all christendom you would ask them there would be those that would say yes we're looking for the coming of the lord yes we're believing on the lord to return but remember you've got to be following the right pathway there's not many ways there is one way jesus said i am notice the way it's not a doctrine it's not a teaching the way is the person of jesus christ i am the way the truth and the lies without the truth you don't have the way without the life you're not in the way and the truth is not in you all of this comes together it's not multiple paths now i know if you were going to go to cleveland you could take six along the lake and everything else or you could get out here on route two and go in or you could take turnpike get off 480 and go in over there i understand there's many different ways to get there but i think you get to my point that there is not many different ways to get unto god no man coming to the father but by me there is one mediator between god and man and that's the man christ jesus so there must be sight that'll connect us into that because just to believe on him will never bring a change of life but when you get connected into that life then it is his life flowing through you to what others cannot see him but they can see what a real christian is and they can see that indeed he is seated in power because it is manifested in your life there's a greater power inside of you greater is he that's in you so a seer this is what it would be called in the old testament a seer to recognize in the new testament paul and i'm not going to even get close to that tonight paul was that first major prophet in the new testament because there had to be a separating of law and grace paul was chosen he didn't choose himself god chose him said i have chosen you to bear my name before the gentiles to be a light to deliver them from satan's hold he would minister to them the hidden mystery that lay there in the old testament that which lay in christ that all the rest of them they didn't understand it remember even the the the the the apostles asked him will at this time you restored the kingdom to israel they didn't see that peter did not see that but god gave that revelation to whom it was intended to be the spokesman of that revelation god had peter for the work of the circumcision and paul said he wrought mightily that work in peter just as he had wrought mightily the work in my in me toward the uncircumcision but in this day god promised by his word and i'm not getting into this either but god promised by his word that he would send another a prophet in this hour at the ending of those seven church ages the reality of that prophet coming was because the church had gotten off track they were headed in the wrong direction but god made a promise in his word that he would send elijah the prophet not elijah the man but the characteristic of elijah one who would stand on the word of god when there was all kinds of odds against him when the nation was stacked against him when all things were against him but god said he would send elijah the prophet to do what call us back to the original faith [Applause] not church rituals not church traditions but to call us back to a living god what do you call that previews but you said i i say that because when we are living there is one there's only here in the new testament two major prophets the gentiles then are gone and then those two witnesses those two prophets there stepped forth to israel and the gentile days are done so remembering that when god sends this word he interprets that word through the man's life the man is speaking the word and god is interpreting that promise so it is not the man claiming oh i'm this or i'm that no because remember the bible says it like this that the spirit of truth he will not glorify himself meaning that the vessel will never glorify itself but the spirit of truth working through that individual it brings that individual to the realization it must be caught doing it it is god doing it that's the same way in your life it's god doing it not i deliver it but christ who liveth in me is that right so to find that that that how god would send and interpret that word and god makes his word positive let that settle god makes his word prospect positive that's when god brings a prophet on the scene and when god brings that prophet on the scene there's a word to be spoken it's a manifestation of the living god for that the people's faith would be built in the word because remember the prophet is sent there anointed with the word to speak to the people that they might rise and take their inheritance oh glory i love this scripture hosea 12 13. by prophet the lord brought israel out of egypt and by prophet was he preserved mightiest nation in the world god didn't sit down and get another superior power doesn't need the efforts of man it's only a yielded vessel deliverance comes by yielded vessels and by a prophet the lord brought israel out of egypt no god wasn't interested in turning egypt around he was interested in bringing out of egypt israel who is israel my firstborn god's interested in bringing out your sons and his daughters that's what the word comes it comes to call you out it comes to call you out as a daughter of god and that's why you couldn't fit in with the world it takes the revealed word of the lord by the presence of jesus christ so that you begin to recognize wait a minute this is what i've been longing for and i can't even explain what it is [Applause] but it's just something that it just fits your hand like a glove [Applause] he brought israel out of egypt oh my and by a prophet was he preserved israel when they came out they come to the red sea pharaoh is going to try to impersonate but god told the prophet speak it was a spoken word that opened up the way it opened up the path through the blood are you with me the word brings us in contact with the blood it opened up the way and pharaoh tried to impersonate it and he was overtaken well was it israel was preserved by a prophet when it came time judgment was coming upon egypt impending judgment was coming remember god had told moses when he gets moses out there before the burning bush he said hey he says i have heard i have heard the cries of my people moses was busy being moses are you with me now i'll come to that later in a moment moses was just busy with just moses he was caught up with moses he was caught up with this this sheeper that sheep and this you know he was caught up with moses he had forgot he had forgotten the promise you see how natural things of life can invade and cause us to forget the promise it isn't that we forget it but yet what happens is we're not living according to it in a rare realm of expectation but god in his mercy calls his prophet calls him there over into that place and he says i have come down i've come down to bring him out of egypt so it was god remember what is a prophet is a sign the word of the lord comes to the prophet they were not listen to me israel had no chance of getting out of egypt without god sending his word and god's sending his word his word is not separate from him he is the word he came down himself brother you might look at that and say moses said the same thing lord when i say this what are they going to say but moses what he failed to recognize it isn't how forceful you can speak it isn't how this no it's that faith in your heart that can take that word and you may not even have an audible voice you may have such a hoarse throat you can only get it out with your lips moving but god he inspires that heart and the devil has to obey that faith in the living god hallelujah [Applause] i've come down to deliver them now come i'm sending you god sent it down right i think of how brother branham when he's you you he says this over and over god hiding in simplicity and and he says it over and over when god does something it's in such humility such humble he don't come to the big you know highfalutin and everything else that's what man thinks you see that's worldly thinking but god comes in humility my my my i got to stay on here because i'll go to preaching on hattie writing the rest of them but i got to stay right here tonight but notice when moses the bible remember what the bible said how be it not all came out by moses and yet you're looking you would say moses at the forefront they're all marching one and one right behind moses but not all of them came out under that revelation the wilderness was a testing ground are you with me it was a testing ground the wilderness did not take god by surprise god was ready to wipe all of them out is that right but god's mercy remember what the word has done in this hour if not for the word in this hour there would be no one to make up the breach but god and god threw his word in the heart of that prophet it stands in the breach brother amen and when god would have wiped it all out yet standing in the breach here is the mercy of god that's calling out why because there's a joshua in there there's a caleb in there come on somebody god would have wiped out all the moabites but there was a roof that had to come out of there oh there's a lot of things about our family tree it's not worth bragging on but god who is rich in mercy it's a paradox of what god has done he makes known his power yeah the bible goes on paul said they were all baptized unto moses meaning what you've seen it you're responsible god parted them you were baptized by the cloud by the pillar fly the red sea they were baptized god has opened the way tell your friends this is how serious it is you're responsible that's not to scare you but at the same time if you're not where you ought to be last call let god take you there where you need to be quit wrestling with hold my heart oh my just say god come and deal with my stony heart break up this fallow ground you can't plant seed on hard ground you got to break it up you know how it is when you go to break up ground you don't necessarily go out there with a shovel you'll take a pitchfork it's got some points on it you're going down deep and you're moving it around and moving around chunks are coming up you're loosening up that soil because you have intentions to plant they were preserved by a prophet when moses said you know when joshua and candle came back the rest of them come back and say uh-uh you ain't going to be able to do that right no no no but joshua and camp were preserved you know why they had received this word not as the word of a man they had a revelation of who moses was he was god's representative it was god's sign it was god's power that was made known to egypt and that was a sign to them that as i stand with this word and this word in me then god's power is with me to possess all that god has said belongs to me oh hallelujah moses was ordained by god you know brother brown was saying like this he moses was it was a sign he was a sign a prophet is a sign of judgment when you see a prophet come upon there's judgment coming when moses comes it was a sign i like how brother brahman says it like this that god prepared for israel now god's preparation was not just that he spoke it to abraham but remember before the foundation of the world god his plan of redemption was all laid out abraham was caught up into what god had already said and what god had already said gave him comfort to face the future oh don't you recognize this is what the revealed word of the hour does it mean by showing you and i into what god has already set it's finished it's a finished work then it gives us comfort to face the future hallelujah i said hallelujah glory be to god god prepared a sign for them so not only what was spoken but there at the burning bush god was preparing that sign hallelujah and you know when he came down there as we said not all recognize it you see moses knew who he was now listen to me now as a prophet he knew who he was he knew his position he knew what god had called him to do are you with me because god had told him that he's seen that identified but he could not tell that to the people i was going to let that drop he could not tell that to the people god sent him down there remember moses asked the question what am i going to tell them they're going to ask me what your name is because every time god comes in deliverance he reveals his name what am i going to tell them god tells them you say i am that i am i am the god of abraham i am the god of isaac [Music] i'm not the god of saying second-handed experiences i'm the god of a first-hand experience i'm the god of the first porn hallelujah so as he came in there remember brother brown would say just like this he said you know moses could not go in there and tell him hey hey look look i i'm the one hey hey i'm the one i'm him god don't work that way you get a guy that's trying to say i'm this and i'm that and i'm this and then that that's a billboard big as can be that he's not the one now i can do this and i can deacon and i can do this that's a billboard that man is not the man are you with me because moses comes into god's presence and he begins to spill all of his weaknesses what does that bring it brings him into a place of complete dependency on the power of god to perform the promise you see it took him beyond the written word the written word did not in itself have power to release him but when god who gave the word was revealed it took him into the spirit that's why the bible said the letter kill it but the spirit giveth life it makes the word alive inside of you hallelujah he couldn't tell him who he was but the elect caught it amen the elect caught it they didn't have to have it taught and taught and broke down to him they caught it it was just something about it that was just ringing to them think of it israel got two signs egypt egypt only got the one national sign took the water poured it out became blood that was a national sign judgment but the two signs think of what israel received oh my we could just preach a month of sundays on this they received that sign of where throw down that stick and there would be impersonators come but that stick remember what that stick represented in the hand of moses it represented the deity of jesus christ the name of jesus christ that is given into the hands of the church of the living god is that right and when then satan wanted to rise up as an impersonation and they threw down their sticks and their sticks became serpents but remember moses was rely upon what god had said and god had revealed his power and it was there in the midst of that test that the power of god overcame satan and all of those serpents that were there brother that's the same way sister in your life amen with the name of jesus christ there might be many things that are thrown down and tests and things that you can't explain but if you'll just yield to the power of god that's inside of you he will consume every one of those serpents you might stand there and say i don't know what to do let me tell you what to do stand still and see the salvation of god what's god consume that cancer watch god consume that depression what's god consume that anxiety once god consumed that situation [Applause] hallelujah every devil has to bow at the name of jesus christ put his hand in his bosom brought it out it was leprous showing that the heart of man is leprous it's from a lack of a proper diet what's a proper diet the bread of life he brought it out showing that the heart of man is consumed with leprosy if it's a life that just fades away the first birth will fade away but then he said take your hand and put it back into your bosom and pull it out and his hand oh my i think the bible says now it comes to my mind the bible says somebody was fresh his hand was so fresh you know the the skin i don't i don't have it in front of me but he just come to me of how that moses skin was when he pulled it out you know what it was it showed what god does in the heart of a believer brother he changes your life from a leprous condition where you're isolated from the presence of god you might want to be a christian but the leprosy in your heart you say what do i do let the hand of god touch you let the hand of god touch your soul and when he touches your life he'll change it from a leprous condition to a fresh life this is what a prophet's message does it come to call them out of where they were slaving going along into their inheritance you see the rest the rest of the world the rest of the world you and me included let me just bring it right down here even as a young person when i said and heard the message and go about my own life and maybe even as you're sitting here you recognize that if not for god coming by his word let me just put it to you just as simple as brother brown says it if not for god coming through the prophet and it being revealed to you you go right on living just like you always did got to build a new home this year got to get a better car than the jones got to do this he said so much on this and we and he said now those things are all right but you must realize brother all this stuff will perish you see what happens when that of a prophet comes it reveals when that's revealed to you it changes the priorities of your life your priority then becomes on the promise that god has manifested in that generation and the manifestation did not stop with the prophet that was only to identify the word that's promised to this generation and call us into that place that god might manifest his word through us you see to receive go outside by divine revelation and this i just say this very plainly and i i encourage you as your pastor these are things i've said and i've talked sometimes with people and you know i just say it this simple pray and ask god to reveal himself to you if you're content with where you're at and you say well you know i'm just saying you know i just like this church i like coming here some mighty fine people here i agree with you but it's more than just a good church and mighty fine people you want to get into that atmosphere that keeps touching your life because that atmosphere is not meant to just be at church he's letting you know when he's touching your life it's not by accident it's not just whoops i just happen to be here no no no god is letting you know that he's inviting you into that place to where whether you're here or you're out there on monday you're out there on tuesday you're no longer living just as one of this world where your priorities and ambitions and vision are on the things of life you have to take care of those things but it lifts you up into a place that you don't got to tell nobody if you got to tell somebody that you love god and your life don't show it you need to check your experience i'll show me and preach on if you've got to tell somebody what i believe the message and your life don't say it you need an experience with god if you say i believe that jesus christ is the son of god and your life don't declare it you need an experience with jesus christ i'm talking about a vision a vision of the word that gives you a sight that goes beyond this world where the word it'll take priority in your life because we're living in the time as it was in the days of lots as it was in the days of knowing people were occupied with themselves men are lovers of themselves that's peerless times they don't care who they destroy they don't care what they tear up they don't care what they do this they don't care what they don't care you see a lot of the things we wouldn't have them tearing down statues if there hadn't been god torn down in pulpits preached brother samuel they tore down god and look what it's produced [Applause] a bunch of marxists and anarchists and everything else this is what it's produced why they tore down god they tore down a genuine experience of the holy ghost where god comes and dwells in them let me get back on here that's reality though i said that's reality you can't have the message going on out there and not be connected back in with church let me just tell you something you can have religion but religion will never save you religion don't match the challenge of the hour you can know everything about this message and it's all religion you've got to have the power of god who sent this word in this generation [Applause] i pray to god whether you're streaming or you're here if that's not anchored in your soul i pray that god won't let you sleep i pray he'll deprive you of every ounce of peace i pray he'll shake your soul until you recognize i need an experience with jesus christ to recognize that's available [Applause] the vision the vision will declare itself it reveals when god is revealed when the vision of the word is revealed you don't have to wonder are people really serving the lord that's right that's right they're living for god whether they're in in church on sunday or or thursday then it's monday tuesday when he's their life and i just say a point blank for people who want to stay out of church for every little excuse i'm not talking about it but for every little excuse and got every little thing in the world i'm trying to speak deep to your soul you need a real checkup with god because you're not going to bypass this this is a sign that's been put right before you man why can't i preach happy things but it's the truth i said it's the truth i don't want a church life yeah i don't want a church of life so god through the ministry of a prophet oh how much is brought let me let me just let me just skip a few things here i'm going to ohio hosea chapter 12 verse 10 i have also spoken by the prophets and i have multiplied visions and used similitudes he's not just talking about their person as far as god stepping down in that prophet because remember a prophet is a sign when john came on the scene it was a sign the messiah is at hand when ezekiel was a sign of judgment all right jeremiah isaiah these were signs when moses came it was a sign of judgment on egypt but these similitudes was not just god coming down and moving behind those vessels remember these prophets god would have ezekiel to lay on his side for what was it 430 days on on the one side and then on the other then then lay on his other side for i think 90 days i can't even lay on my side probably when i sleep for an hour are you with me what i'm trying to say is is that you look at that and brother branham would say this in the message a true sign overlooked he said you know you would wonder in your mind why does this have to be done i want you to think about it brother brown said many of these prophets were thought by the people to be mentally disturbed in reality they were the most sane people [Applause] they think we're nuts but we're in our right mind i'm not out in strange they're the strange birds they don't have a they don't have an identity but we're eagles the bible says out there they are full of every unclean and hateful bird we're not birds we're eagles [Applause] we're not in a cage we're in liberty in jesus christ we're not strange when they think you're i don't care when people think i'm out i don't care you don't do this or that you know just like i told her one time i just started working and here come this older lady was an age she was you know 72 years old or whatever and she was like like almost like a spring chicken and and uh mom she didn't get around as good as you had to put that in for good measure oh happy hour's coming she came by the room sam happy hour tonight said she said you're going to be there i said no betty why not i said because i'm a christian well i am too i don't know because what i got he took that drink out of me he took that out of me i didn't have to lay it down he took it out so if it was all right i figured he'd let it alone glory oh my and you similar to god use those things laying on the side here and laying on the side all of these things like one walking around naked what was it showing you know why god did that because they would not read the word brother braham said they got to a place that the bible was boresome to them they won't read the word they get to a place they don't even pray this is what brother i'm saying it's true it just becomes religion but this is what we're a part of this is what we do christianity is not a that's lifestyle it's the life of jesus christ on display darmish have lifestyle we're not lifestyle it'll change your life oh my let me go and use similitudes by the ministry of the prophets now every gift that god gives it's sent with a for a divine purpose let me let me move here first samuel 3 1. and here comes samuel that's how this is ministered he ministered unto the lord before eli and the word of the lord was precious in those days there was no open vision the word of the lord was precious but there wasn't an open vision there wasn't no prophet there you see to open up into the thoughts of god and remember in genesis 15 1 the word of the lord came unto abraham in a vision saying fear not abraham i am thy shield and by exceeding great reward vision is divine revelation your eyes become anointed they become open and you're seeing things reading in the word but you're saying not just letters but it's becoming real to you it becomes a pathway it becomes places for you to put your feet verse 19 the first samuel 3 and samuel grew and the lord was with him and didn't let none of his words fall to the ground and then none of his words see god it's god's word and he gave it to samuel and samuel was was committed to god to speak his word he had to speak things straight to eli that wasn't comfortable sleeping there in the house of the lord and here's eli the priest and then have to come him and say judgments come into your house but he have the word of the lord right and verse 20 and all israel from dan even to beersheba knew that samuel was established to be a prophet of the lord they knew it they knew it did it mean they obeyed it no but they knew it you see it this is why it's not enough to know brother brahms a prophet you gotta have the holy ghost get under the blood and the lord appeared again in shiloh for the lord look at this says the lord revealed himself to samuel in shiloh what's it say by the word of the lord how does god reveal himself by his word think of this as he revealed himself to samuel remember what remember what was going on in the judges when you read in the book of judges it says it in in multiple places and you see it every man did according to what was right in his own eyes this is why we must have a seer eyes that god will open and then that anointing comes upon our eyes not not these but the eyes down here because these eyes right here will tell you ah things are coming back in things are getting good and this but these guys down here say look away lift up your head your redemption is drawing nine these eyes will say you'll never make it this eye says he already made it for me [Applause] these eyes will pick up things that bring reasoning and imagination but these eyes down here on the inside they catch a hold of from that of the unseen realm and it stabilizes us that's why god has called us to walk by faith by revelation by the eyes of the lord you know it's impossible to please god without faith you see brother branham are not not brother brand but here the lord jesus in john 10. can i have just a few more moments let me just try to bring this down into a place in john 10 i don't have it i don't think i included it but i've got it here when jesus you remember they the pharisees can't figure out what's going on here he is standing in front of them and they're asking him show us a sign show us a sign show us a sign and remember jesus said a wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign i think what they were asking for they were there they were asking for a sign and brother brown takes that in the message true sign a true sign overlooked and he said they were actually asking for an emotion he said because you can look at the sunset and get emotional and cry or the sun rise and cry they were asking for a sign on here something that would give emotion but you see the promise was not that but the promise was the resurrection what they didn't recognize they claimed that we are the children of abraham we have you know the prophets and this and that and jesus identifies the spirit in them and says this is the same spirit that put those prophets in the toe come on now when stephen preached that day they took it they took his head off where they stoned him right because when when he came the religious they had the word but they couldn't recognize god's sign his word the same god that had been all along and yet here you had ignorant listen to me ignorant unlearned men i like how brother brandon throws us in there and includes it peter couldn't recognize his name if it was wrote on the side of a boxcar you know what that means even if he had poor eyesight and it was wrote on a billboard he wouldn't be able to recognize his name it sure god doesn't need the smarts and the intuition and the intellect it's not about our mind figuring it out it's god revealing himself in his word by his power hallelujah and they were asking for this sign show us this and show us that and here you have those where the word comes to them seeks them out and they receive it like the young man whose eyes were healed of blind lord who is he that i may worship him but jesus when he was speaking to them in john 10 34 he said it's written in your law that you're god's and if he called them gods unto whom the word of god came remember gods they were speaking the word that had come to them so it was god's word they didn't make the word up god gave it to him and when that word was received the same anointing that opened that word to the prophet came with that word and where the word finds a place the anointing comes with the word oh i feel like preaching a little bit say ye of him whom the father has sanctified sent into the world thou blaspheme is because i said i'm the son of god if i do not the works of my father believe me not but if i do though you believe me not believe though you do not believe me believe the works that you may know and believe that the father is in me and i in him he's tying it together when the word of god is come into your life what will that do it brings forth the works of god it brings forth the works of god though a person can look at you here here jesus jesus is the god prophet and he's letting him know if you can't believe me believe the works the works notice what's the works it's the word being interpreted believe the works that the father is in me and i am in him let's just stop there i don't want to lose this so god brings this he brings it together let me just let me just stop there like i close it and the way i don't keep going maybe we can come back to church tomorrow night saturday night i agree but you recognize within this i say god you see how it it the the parallel god's mercy god sends a prophet that prophet comes with the word of the lord he's not coming with his word it's god's word and god has given him that word to declare once you think of this many of the prophets the inspiration the bible tells us that holy men with god they spake as they were moved by the holy ghost you can read it in the scripture at times where daniel he would receive a visitation from god he didn't understand it but he wrote down what came to him brother rem said many of the prophets picked up daniel picked up many they didn't understand but they wrote it down because it was coming under inspiration you see they didn't have to understand it inspiration gave it inspiration will come in due season to anoint the word to be sounded out and the inspiration will come to bring that word into manifestation but simon what does that mean don't try to figure it all out just say be it unto me according to thy word just be simple the inspirations coming don't try to don't try to figure it out let it just fall into your life let it fall into your heart say god i want my heart to be a betting ground if there's things that i said earlier there's things in your life you see there's a hardness ask god say lord dissolve that hardness i prayed with an individual here not too many months ago talked to him on the phone and as i talked to him on the phone and began to talk about did we begin to talk about some different things and you know brother samuel you don't understand there's a you know these problems and these problems and these demons and things like that i said listen god he takes care of every one of those things i said god the same god that loosened my life is the same god it will set you free i began to speak to him as god was giving me word about their heart so i went to pray for him i said now do you do you may want me to pray in that manner i said no i want you to pray and this is what the individual said i want you to pray that god will soften my heart let me tell you something he's the same god he's softening that heart too he's the same god you see when a heart that's why brother braham says when a heart has a desire to see god there ain't nothing can hold them back let me tell you something you didn't give yourself that desire god gave you that desire put that on the inside of you it's god that come by and stirred it out that's why you couldn't be satisfied anywhere else you might have had your start in this church or start here and start there but there's something about it you just it seemed like this isn't home and you couldn't even explain it what was it you were born and ordained to live in his presence that your eyes might be anointed you go to school but you're not like the rest of the school kids you're not making yourself different it's god even even even when a person is not even living right has not even been changed it's a struggle for him to do those things you know why there's a convicting power and it's something you recognize you can't flow into it the rest of the world can go along with it it doesn't bother them but there's something different what is that that's a seed that's got to come to life and there's only one one one place he can come to life and that's bad the water of life himself thank god for eyes if not for eyes you'd be like i was oh praise god oh my i can't wait to get down there and you know see one of the places i was really wanting to see was hattie wright's place oh lord i can't wait till i get down to see you know go down there you know in jeffersonville oh my you know on the way and going to look into some of those places you know and just pray and all of a sudden here i'm looking up zanesville um you know what listen to me now this is on all them this is on all of you hi i won't even get you right now nobody else spoke up everybody else enjoying the ride eating their snacks and drinking their water with flavoring and everything else in it man they're enjoying the ride all of a sudden i recognize i'm taking this truck the wrong way there were signs that told me that because really going towards zaneville i wouldn't have known that i really got to zanesville until i got there because then you know some of you know in that area of route 70 and that's the place of uh the wilderness in ohio and you know it's just a span like the other part of columbus to cincinnati is the flatlands i wouldn't have known if there hadn't been no signs right but god gives signs that's the mur that's god's mercy for your life that you can see signs sometimes you may have taken a wrong turn you may have went a wrong way you may have went in haste but the mercy of god he gives you signs and those signs are there for you to check on your destination god gives you clear signs on the real evidence of the holy ghost [Music] so that so that you know it's not it's not all of this is brother brahma is laying it very heavy it's not just resting on an emotion no no he says you meet that god and when you meet that god you'll know you met him because your desires change your wants change see because it's an inward work the devil can make it the devil can come around on emotions are you with me he can try to beat you around but see when that solid ground has come you're not standing on your solid ground you're on the solid ground of the word you know your life has changed you see your desires you see you know you've met god oh my look i closed it here but i can't close musicians come listen now friends don't those are streaming and those are here i really mean with all my heart don't let these times don't let them bypass you god has been bringing this with the prophets and to me has just been such such a a wonderful way not because it's been me but because of what god have god's been opening it and you see it personally in your life the sovereign a sovereign god and i say with everything within you if you haven't given everything to god why not why not why don't you give him everything why don't you turn your life into his hands and i'm not just talking about somebody who's new you you might been coming here for years it might be a family thing but family thing ain't good enough and ain't good enough well that's where uncle so and so grandpa so and so that is that ain't good enough you got to meet this jesus yourself you got to let this word come in your life and change you to where that where the rest of the people they won't even know where to begin oh god sent a prophet in this age they won't even know where to begin on that but you see your life and my life [Music] ought to be a true sign that there's a true god a true baptism of the holy ghost that brings us into the truth of the word i'm telling you tonight it's for you i said it's for you whether you're here whether you're streaming you might say but sam you're not there to lay hands on you don't need my hands on you if your heart is ready god can come and if your heart's not ready just be honest with him say lord soften up the ground turn my heart lord create in me create in me lord let god move down let it let god move down let god do the work maybe if you've made a wrong turn and there's something that's come along listen let me just tell you something don't let the devil trap you in that wrong turn there's inspiration right here tonight you can get off of that track you're you're going on there's inspiration you can get off that track and you can turn around that's what repentance is simple repentance you might say well brother sam you know i i repented a long time ago god did a work but maybe there's something in your life where you've gotten off track but you say lord maybe it's you let down on reading maybe you've letting down on your walk with god you just let cares of life and and the spirit of god he don't come to condemn you he comes to just speak to your heart to let you know hey you're getting sidetracked here get your vision back on track and you find that that real true repentance and confession it invites the presence of god to move right down god is merciful don't don't keep going that track and if you've got off you've made a wrong way turn don't let the devil don't let the devil beat you down there's inspiration right here tonight just walk walk in his inspiration let me tell you something the devil would like to trap you in a pit in your mind back in something of the past but god has already freed you because remember the pit you were in was a pit of your nature but god has changed your nature you're not identified with that pit god rich in mercy don't you love him i'll tell you i just want to give him everything i want to give him everything i don't want to take for granted that it's just i want him to have every part i want the word to take over more of samuel i don't want to limit him and say jesus you can only have a little bit more no lord if there's areas in my life where i've got stuff piled up i don't want it there i want you there lord i want you there [Music] oh let's pray heavenly father you're the one that has to put it all together [Music] and lord it isn't about that everything would have to fit just soul but it's you speaking to our lives lord this is more i know that each

choosing it's your choice and when that begins to move upon our hearts then what comes out of our hearts and our lives is lord i surrender [Music] now lord you know the needs tonight those that are gathered around their computer their phone their tablet those that are those that are here father now pray that may that vision of the word if it hasn't broken in a heart and a life maybe in humility just right now in their heart just say lord reveal yourself to me may they not try to figure it out may they just let the inspiration the breath of almighty god just moved down in their life living in humility say lord be it unto me according to that word god i pray that you'll just make yourself known to him i pray that god that you'll take every stoney heart and lord you'll soften it up that's not hard to pray that because that's what you spoke in your word lord i ask god that you'll give him the courage to stand on your word grant it lord jesus tonight may you feel lord hearts bring him to a place of real consecration lord god where you step in lord i pray tonight may you feel every fiber of our being lord if there is any place lord any any any area that's gone off track lord this is
