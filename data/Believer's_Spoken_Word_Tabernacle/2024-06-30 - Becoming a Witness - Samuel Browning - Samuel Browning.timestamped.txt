[38:55] emotion I'm depending in on the
[38:58] word amen with all that God does Amen
[39:02] through every service each special
[39:05] moment in our life is to Anchor us
[39:08] further in the word to where when we
[39:11] don't feel we don't sense we we are
[39:14] Stand Fast on the word of God because he
[39:17] is the word he is the word amen you love
[39:20] him this morning amen so good to be in
[39:23] the house of the Lord and
[39:26] uh I don't know did you have them shake
[39:28] hands yet you
[39:30] did amen well amen we'll just let you be
[39:34] seated turn around just wave at somebody
[39:36] then we'll let you be seated here just
[39:38] for a moment amen so good to be in the
[39:40] house of the Lord and amen good to
[39:43] uh I I think it's good to greet one
[39:46] another and uh I I think that's a that's
[39:50] a real we come here for the main purpose
[39:52] and that's to see him and to have a
[39:54] meeting with him but I tell you I
[39:57] certainly I love that to be able to come
[39:59] together and to Fellowship around the
[40:01] word of God it's just something special
[40:04] about it that when we can come together
[40:07] you know even when you look at the very
[40:09] Word Church itself when Jesus said Upon
[40:12] This Rock I will build my church The
[40:13] Very Word Church it means those that are
[40:17] called out of their homes and into a
[40:20] public place for Gathering amen so we we
[40:24] just don't have church by
[40:26] ourselves God God set up the order that
[40:28] we we come together the Bible said
[40:31] forsake not to assemble yourselves
[40:33] together is that right that that's those
[40:35] are things that that God won't do for us
[40:38] but we show our faith just you know just
[40:40] that little bit of of just saying Lord
[40:42] I'm going to honor your word regardless
[40:44] of my feelings and I I may not feel like
[40:47] anything at all and you you might feel
[40:49] like well you know all kinds of Gloom
[40:52] but I'll tell you when you stand and you
[40:54] honor God's word you can expect God to
[40:58] come on the scene
[41:01] hallu sir and I want to remind you there
[41:04] were three times in the year that the
[41:06] males in Israel wter were to present
[41:09] themselves amen and we recognize all
[41:11] that we could get into a lot of types
[41:13] that's three dispensations and Son of
[41:16] God Son of Man son of David and but you
[41:18] know the Bible said they weren't to come
[41:20] empty and I think yet God asks you and I
[41:24] this the greatest desire I have is Lord
[41:26] I don't want anything to hinder you from
[41:29] moving here in this service and moving
[41:31] deeper in my life but yet we're not
[41:33] coming empty we're coming with a
[41:36] purpose we're coming with what all that
[41:39] he's revealed to me up to this time I've
[41:42] given myself too and I'm counting and
[41:45] looking on the word to continue to work
[41:47] and move through my life and to
[41:49] accomplish what the word has said it
[41:51] will do so we're not presenting
[41:54] ourselves empty we we're not empty we're
[41:56] not coming with the blank mind we don't
[41:58] come with a blank slate we've come with
[42:00] a clear direction that we know in whom
[42:02] we have believed and we're persuaded
[42:04] that he is able to keep that which I've
[42:07] committed unto him against the day amen
[42:10] and amen so what a privilege it is to
[42:12] gather together with brothers and
[42:14] sisters of like Precious faith and we
[42:17] certainly love you in the Lord and uh I
[42:20] just uh here in just a moment I some
[42:23] things I want to just kind of touch
[42:25] touch on with you uh before we Minister
[42:28] here uh for a few moments this
[42:30] morning and uh I want to if if you could
[42:35] uh Brianna I'd like you to switch over
[42:37] here there's something that we want to
[42:39] bring to you as an assembly and so uh if
[42:41] you're visiting and we appreciate to
[42:42] have our visitors here with us this
[42:44] morning God bless you amen so good to
[42:46] have you and uh good to have each and
[42:48] everyone and so we want to I want to
[42:51] just kind of uh revisit uh some things
[42:53] and as the uh uh the the trustees and
[42:59] myself we've actually been meeting since
[43:01] um well we meet in regular everything's
[43:03] kept up on a lot of things that we do
[43:06] with um uh and so forth but we had some
[43:09] meetings and because there's a another
[43:12] project we're looking at a beginning uh
[43:14] but I want to just I thought it'd be
[43:16] good to take a look at where that we've
[43:18] come from and you know I'll just be
[43:20] honest with you I've just I've I've so
[43:22] appreciated what has been done here that
[43:24] I I actually I kind of kind of forgot
[43:27] what it used to look like and that's the
[43:29] truth I went back and it was some months
[43:31] ago and it was just you know real late
[43:33] in the evening I was trying to relaxed
[43:35] my mind and I saw this file and it was
[43:37] what brother Shane had put together and
[43:39] this is where everything at one point in
[43:41] time had started
[43:42] from and uh uh you know and that was
[43:45] just a couple years ago and uh you know
[43:48] I I'm just so thankful to the Lord and
[43:50] how that kind of got moved along there
[43:52] in June of 2022 and um you know Brooks
[43:56] concrete they had uh we contracted with
[43:58] them they tore all of that out and and
[44:00] we started and there was a lot of
[44:03] pictures here with all of that taken
[44:05] place I I drove down into the driveway I
[44:08] know brother Shane brother Richie they
[44:10] uh were here with it uh probably brother
[44:12] Aaron was it sometime we we just we
[44:14] weren't always here at the at uh
[44:16] together and and brother Richie had to
[44:19] kind of call their hand on a few things
[44:21] so I I just appreciate you know uh not
[44:24] that they were trying to be Shady so I
[44:26] don't want you think that but you know
[44:28] it's good to have somebody to that you
[44:30] going call them there and say hey wait
[44:31] wait wait this is not how we we we we
[44:33] designed it and so um then even when it
[44:36] came to all of this outside here um that
[44:40] in itself too was much uh how that
[44:43] brother Richie when he drew Drew
[44:45] everything up we had a lot that wanted
[44:47] to try to bid the job and do it a
[44:49] certain way and but I'll tell you I I
[44:51] just think it's I'm just I think it's
[44:54] beautiful and you say brother Samuel
[44:57] you you know you say you you really
[45:01] shouldn't talk about a building like
[45:03] that well look I I know that the the
[45:06] important thing is not the building but
[45:07] I also remember the prophet said now
[45:09] that we've made the be the building
[45:11] beautiful we want to make the inside
[45:14] Beautiful by a character and so when God
[45:17] even told Solomon if you really if you
[45:19] get to nailing it down how much if you
[45:22] would try to get everything together of
[45:24] what Solomon's Temple would cost in
[45:25] today's uh Society it was millions of
[45:30] dollars but God said to bring it make it
[45:32] magnifical that's a that's a word is
[45:34] that right some of you already on edge
[45:36] you don't know where I'm going but uh
[45:39] you know it was not to be something that
[45:41] would be that this is where our stock is
[45:43] in but I believe that you know it it
[45:46] expresses what what we think and what we
[45:49] feel and um you know we're not a we're
[45:51] not a big congregation we're just a a
[45:54] small group of people that love the Lord
[45:56] and you know it's just like as if I read
[45:59] it all the way through the message and
[46:00] I've got so many different quotes and as
[46:02] those things come up and you know in
[46:04] different studies and it's up to God how
[46:06] God brings together even an assembly and
[46:08] how God will add brother Bram said it
[46:10] can be from 5 to 12 to hundreds what
[46:13] what however God sees fit to do it but
[46:15] we're after one thing more than bodies
[46:18] we want to see Christ in the people
[46:21] that's that's the objective that's the
[46:23] objective and we want a rallying we
[46:25] don't want a rallying around a Ministry
[46:27] when we want a rallying around the word
[46:30] amen because that's what brings that's
[46:31] what brings Real Results in our life is
[46:33] where hearts and lives are just grabbing
[46:36] a hold of Jesus Christ and so I believe
[46:38] that's the desire of of all of us and so
[46:41] I I want to just very quickly here touch
[46:43] on this um we're looking at um uh we've
[46:48] been exploring this on a parking lot and
[46:50] driveway project this has actually been
[46:51] something that's kind of been on the
[46:53] docket for a long time but you know it
[46:55] just has things just kind of come up and
[46:57] it just kind of pushes its way on back
[46:59] and um but it's something that we've got
[47:02] a few pictures and there's obviously a
[47:04] whole lot more we could take of it that
[47:06] when Services was going on and you can
[47:09] see individuals I don't know what it
[47:10] looks out looks like out here today
[47:12] because we're missing a number of people
[47:14] but I know at times where it's it's been
[47:16] uh clear through there and people have
[47:18] even parked on the other side of that
[47:19] driveway and down the middle and um so
[47:22] even in some of
[47:24] the uh some of the other the pictures
[47:27] and things like that you can kind of uh
[47:29] see that that you know there's spaces
[47:32] even in the one that's the video there's
[47:33] there was some spaces where we probably
[47:35] could have done a little bit better of
[47:37] fitting in there on that particular day
[47:39] um but I'm thankful that at least we do
[47:42] have a place and we have gravel to park
[47:43] on right now um but we know that one of
[47:47] the things that before we could ever
[47:48] talk about this and the reason it would
[47:50] kind of get moved down the road is
[47:52] because um out here you know in the
[47:55] parking lot sometimes you showed up you
[47:57] you didn't know whether do I bring my
[47:58] kayak my canoe or just drive in and um
[48:01] you know in in reality that that's not
[48:04] uh that was not um us but if you look
[48:06] all up and down a lot of times up and
[48:09] down the road and then you go across um
[48:12] in these areas like even when the
[48:13] brothers are mowing grass and things
[48:15] they have to be so mindful but it's it's
[48:18] much lower the the way that the the the
[48:21] Earth and all of that or the way that
[48:22] they've taken it off it lays and it's
[48:24] very very difficult and so the brothers
[48:27] got together and the first thing we had
[48:29] to do is get drainage and then that took
[48:31] place uh was that two years ago now that
[48:34] drainage took place that that
[48:37] line yeah so it's pretty close to about
[48:39] two years ago in the fall and that
[48:42] drainage they they they've got it so
[48:44] that it goes down that property and we
[48:46] still have some things over here uh to
[48:48] do but you had to get the water off
[48:50] otherwise if you put anything down it's
[48:51] going to bust it up so uh we've been
[48:54] able to uh by the grace of God to do
[48:57] that and so this is kind of what we're
[48:59] we're looking at with that the parking
[49:01] lot and driveway project and brother
[49:04] Shane believe it or not when I looked
[49:05] this up on Apple Maps I thought maybe
[49:07] Google would have it right but you know
[49:09] Google doesn't even have our play set in
[49:12] there they don't even have things
[49:14] updated you know I figured Apple
[49:15] probably would you know I really didn't
[49:17] have confidence in Google but that's
[49:19] just a little thing brother Shane and I
[49:21] have but um you know uh at any rate this
[49:26] this here if I can maybe try to uh turn
[49:28] this on here just a moment the the the
[49:31] objective with it with it and what has
[49:34] been bid out we've got a few the
[49:36] brothers have went through and got
[49:37] different bids and they've got bids from
[49:40] black top uh to that of concrete and we
[49:44] looked at that concrete was actually
[49:46] when especially with um the the bid that
[49:49] brother Richie had secured it was
[49:52] actually better than the the black top
[49:53] because with the black top the sealant
[49:56] that we have to do every so often it's
[49:58] very
[49:59] expensive whereas with a concrete um the
[50:03] there is a special uh thing that this
[50:05] gentleman that brother Richie got the
[50:07] bid through and it's actually an Amish
[50:09] gentleman with an Amish crew uh but they
[50:11] do all of your development so they're
[50:13] able to buy the concrete in such bulk
[50:15] but they're the ones who lay the
[50:16] roadways and everything else and so I
[50:19] certainly don't I certainly believe that
[50:20] the Bible that the Bible tells us the
[50:22] footsteps of the righteous are ordered
[50:24] of the Lord and how that sometimes our
[50:26] path ways will cross because when
[50:27] brother Richie got this bid um you know
[50:31] we looked at it and honest to goodness
[50:33] uh even he had different ones look at
[50:35] the bid and say there's no way that guy
[50:36] can do it for that and the guy told him
[50:39] said not only will I I'm doing it for I
[50:41] think it's what's 465 $465 a square yard
[50:45] but he says I'm do I'll do it 5 Ines
[50:47] thick he said and I'll put reinforced
[50:49] bar he said and I'm going to he said I'm
[50:51] going to knock things off because you're
[50:52] a church but they're a whole Amish crew
[50:55] so there was an respect Within in that
[50:57] so we appreciate that um but this is the
[51:01] this what I'm going to give you the
[51:02] figures in a minute and what it is it's
[51:04] the parking lot doing the parking lot up
[51:06] to this telephone pole and then we got
[51:08] to kind of restructure this a little bit
[51:10] but then it's both um driveways is't
[51:13] that something that that's actually on
[51:14] the map called Joy
[51:16] [Laughter]
[51:19] a so right in right in here a lot of
[51:21] this extra parking we've you know looked
[51:24] at that we we need this also really
[51:26] kinds that uh needs to really be tidied
[51:28] up and build up too and there's some
[51:30] things that even as we' go on in the
[51:32] future we know there needs to even be
[51:33] some more overflow because when we have
[51:36] guests beyond our regular Services um
[51:39] it's it becomes very very rough and I
[51:42] don't want to have to have somebody
[51:43] pulled out and we've had that in the
[51:45] past where we've had individuals stuck
[51:47] in places so um this is this is uh kind
[51:51] of where that that's where that's at
[51:52] it's the con the parking lot and then
[51:54] the driveways and so this is the total
[51:57] don't don't anybody fall over but for
[52:00] the parking lot this is the total for
[52:02] the parking lot the driveways and then
[52:05] the total cost of the of of just that
[52:07] now the only thing that total cost does
[52:09] not reflect is when we would have to do
[52:11] striping and those some of those things
[52:13] are things we can do a little bit later
[52:15] we do have we would have to do a little
[52:17] bit of work on this driveway right here
[52:19] and the decision whether to break that
[52:21] up and build up on that or to remove
[52:23] that in order to have those driveways in
[52:27] uh the one thing when we met the other
[52:28] night and and talked about it is that
[52:32] it's going to be advantageous for us at
[52:35] first to begin to look at uh doing if
[52:38] the first thing would be parking lot
[52:40] because if we did
[52:41] driveways first the second stage being
[52:44] parking lot when those concrete trucks
[52:47] back over those driveways they're super
[52:49] heavy and so it would just we would be
[52:51] in a mess so the first thing would if if
[52:54] if it is in a manner that we break it up
[52:57] in phases we would the first thing we
[53:00] would want to then tackle is the parking
[53:01] lot and I I just told the brothers I as
[53:04] we were meeting and we were just talking
[53:06] and conferring among these things I said
[53:08] you know we uh we have until uh brother
[53:11] Richie said we could uh with that
[53:13] gentleman he had extended it all through
[53:15] the year he said look I'll I'll hold it
[53:17] for you guys for the and you know the
[53:19] year you just got to let me know and
[53:21] I'll call I'll call send a crew over
[53:23] there and I can have everything done in
[53:24] two days um so you know we've just put
[53:29] it like this the brothers as we were
[53:31] talking I said we're just going to put a
[53:32] fleece before the Lord and then in
[53:35] September we'll meet and then you know
[53:38] based on the decision and where
[53:40] everything has come from uh within the
[53:42] congregation and we'll know God will
[53:44] give us a direction on which way to go
[53:47] uh now I know sometimes that looks a
[53:49] little that that looks a startling but I
[53:51] I want to remind you when some of you
[53:53] don't are not aware of this but when we
[53:55] first come to this building
[53:57] and we started to in the process of
[53:58] getting a loan we only had $30,000 in
[54:01] the building fund and as soon as this
[54:04] building was presented in one month's
[54:06] time it
[54:08] doubled that we were smaller than we are
[54:11] now and you know when you look at it
[54:13] when you look at these things there is
[54:16] nothing impossible with God we believe
[54:18] that friends I'm not talking about being
[54:20] ignorant but I'm talking about at times
[54:21] that there's things that we have to just
[54:23] we step back and look at this and this
[54:25] is something that it is a need I think
[54:28] probably the sisters would probably be
[54:30] pushing for this more than anybody else
[54:33] but um you know uh I think with within
[54:36] it all we've definitely seen that's been
[54:38] something that's kind of been out there
[54:40] as as as a need and we just I want to um
[54:44] just en en encourage you with that that
[54:47] you know there's nothing that's
[54:48] impossible with God this out here this
[54:51] this project that was done out here with
[54:54] it was remember it was in two stages
[54:56] that entire project I I think it
[54:58] probably was roughly maybe close to
[55:01] 30,000 for that project everything that
[55:03] was done right out here that I showed
[55:05] you in the beginning so and that was
[55:07] with some of that was with uh some of
[55:09] the brothers themselves doing the labor
[55:11] like brother Richie doing that out there
[55:14] so this is just a plan of action I I'm
[55:17] not here to tax you or to burden you and
[55:20] we're not I'm not here to say this is
[55:21] exactly what we're going to do and we're
[55:23] going to go we we can't go through
[55:25] anything if there's not a commitment and
[55:28] so that's where we're that's where we're
[55:30] looking at one of the things that even
[55:31] in my own life I don't like debt I don't
[55:34] like debt I'd rather do without than
[55:36] have debt I don't like debt um and I
[55:39] don't we don't want that for the the the
[55:40] the church I like things to be free and
[55:43] clear are you with me I like things to
[55:46] be free and clear I don't like things I
[55:47] don't like things on our mind or that
[55:49] would weigh us down and what we're able
[55:50] to do financially so this is a a plan of
[55:53] action we're going to do it'll be weekly
[55:55] a special offering when the when the
[55:57] tithes and offerings are taken up just
[55:59] right on the envelope special offering
[56:01] if you're giving in that week and I'm
[56:03] not going to do a separate offering
[56:05] we'll do it during that time and we'll
[56:07] keep all of those things um separate
[56:09] like we did with that before and then uh
[56:12] when the brothers are giving the
[56:13] presentations and things like that like
[56:15] next week brother Shane will be giving
[56:17] kind of an update on what goes on uh in
[56:19] on the monthly basis and then through
[56:21] quarterly so you're aware of that and um
[56:24] just that's how we started it'll be just
[56:27] just like you have the regular TI and
[56:29] offering envelope and you can just write
[56:30] special offering on there and um you
[56:33] know and we all we will see that all of
[56:36] that goes towards the project um there's
[56:39] things that we do have in our savings
[56:41] and the brothers are uh we're looking at
[56:44] all those things but remember savings
[56:46] itself you know I'm sure I I would
[56:48] assume everybody in your savings to me
[56:50] is not is not viable income it's things
[56:53] you look at that's for a rainy day when
[56:55] you have situ ations like and I'm
[56:57] thankful to the Lord that a lot of
[56:59] things in the building I I hope this is
[57:01] all right so you understand this that
[57:03] I'm thankful that within the here for
[57:05] the building that we there's a lot of
[57:07] things that's taken care of right now
[57:08] that by God's grace that we we're not
[57:11] having to worry about when it comes to
[57:12] furnaces and AC's and all that all those
[57:15] things have just been replaced a few a
[57:17] few years back and and that's that's
[57:18] really moving forward so sometimes we do
[57:21] have unexpected costs that come up and
[57:24] um you know we always want to be ready
[57:26] for that too but um and then if you have
[57:30] any questions regarding this you can you
[57:32] know see uh See the trustees uh brother
[57:35] Shane brother Aaron Brother Richie and
[57:37] if there's something that's beyond that
[57:39] but I I would prefer if you just uh just
[57:42] um touch base with them first and um and
[57:46] then we'll just kind of and then move
[57:47] from there the last thing I want to just
[57:49] cover here and that is the the real
[57:52] backing behind it it's a it's uh because
[57:55] we you don't just want to say yeah we
[57:57] want a parking lot yeah we want
[57:59] driveways the F the thing that we that
[58:02] that has to be here is a financial
[58:04] commitment I I this is not my favorite
[58:07] thing to talk about I don't like talking
[58:08] about money but we have to talk about it
[58:11] and there are things that uh with a
[58:14] commitment to things that this is
[58:16] generally what our average monthly
[58:18] expenses are this is without anything
[58:21] extra coming in this as far as without
[58:23] any extra thing happening such as uh air
[58:26] conditioner we had to have service or
[58:28] you have to have gravel or something
[58:30] brought in this is just basic the
[58:32] average monthly expenses and that's that
[58:35] that I've taken some things and averaged
[58:37] it out and so within that part of it um
[58:41] one of the things we want to be able to
[58:42] do and I'd like to encourage you to do
[58:44] because it will actually it helps us not
[58:46] only now but would help as a body in the
[58:49] future and that is to really when you're
[58:51] giving in offerings and tithes and I I
[58:54] appreciate um the the commitment and the
[58:57] faithfulness that that has been uh
[59:00] because things that we would not be able
[59:02] to do things that have been done without
[59:04] that um so I want to say that you know
[59:07] God bless you for that but I would like
[59:09] to also to encourage you that when it
[59:11] comes to uh even the offering part of it
[59:14] you know because the church itself the
[59:16] church doesn't run on tithing that's
[59:19] Ministry and that's everything when I'm
[59:21] bringing Ministry in and everything that
[59:23] that's going on but a church all of
[59:25] these average expenses that runs off the
[59:27] offerings that's what that runs off
[59:30] everything that's that's that's done
[59:32] that all of that runs off of that
[59:34] electric and all those things and we
[59:36] appreciate it don't we and I I know one
[59:39] thing I appreciate I appreciate the
[59:41] lights I appreciate having electricity
[59:43] appreciate having water all those things
[59:45] are important and so I just ask you to
[59:48] really to really to take it upon your
[59:50] heart and to pray about when even you're
[59:53] giving in your offerings and um one of
[59:56] the things that I'll share with you that
[59:57] from the very beginning in my walk with
[1:00:00] the Lord um where I set myself and then
[1:00:03] us as a family is that for me just as
[1:00:06] much as with the tithes I don't budge on
[1:00:09] my offerings so in other words I don't
[1:00:11] make bills with offering in mind I don't
[1:00:15] make you say brother Samuel how can that
[1:00:17] be I I'm not only a witness but I can
[1:00:20] call other probably other Witnesses
[1:00:21] throughout the congregation you can't
[1:00:23] outdo God
[1:00:26] I'm not preaching a Prosperity Gospel I
[1:00:27] don't believe in that I'm just saying
[1:00:29] that you cannot out give God God said
[1:00:33] ties and offerings in Malachi and he
[1:00:35] said prove me and I God is faithful to
[1:00:38] his word how many knows that to be the
[1:00:40] truth God's faithful yeah there's
[1:00:43] temptations that come our way but I I'll
[1:00:45] tell you you watch how God comes on the
[1:00:47] scene because remember this building
[1:00:51] this building is not brother Samuel's
[1:00:52] building this building is our building
[1:00:56] this is our church God has given us this
[1:00:59] building and this property that we have
[1:01:01] and I'm so thankful for it I'm grateful
[1:01:03] that we've got a place that we don't
[1:01:05] have to ask CU we had to do that could
[1:01:07] we have special meetings now could we
[1:01:09] have service now could we do it on a
[1:01:10] Friday night I'm so glad that we don't
[1:01:12] have to do that I'm grateful that God's
[1:01:15] G you know what I'm thankful God's given
[1:01:16] us a place that even where we can have
[1:01:19] some fellowship around those fire pits
[1:01:21] out there aren't you glad for that I'm
[1:01:22] so thankful that God has done that for
[1:01:25] us and i' so I encourage you one of the
[1:01:27] things that the brothers had mentioned
[1:01:29] um and had brought to my attention they
[1:01:31] said look if if we just had to wear that
[1:01:34] even if in our offerings that every
[1:01:36] individual just even increasing by at
[1:01:38] least $10 or or more man the the the
[1:01:41] extra then that gets put back into
[1:01:44] savings and the extra that goes into
[1:01:46] things so that when we come into
[1:01:48] projects it's further build up so I I
[1:01:52] just want to encourage you in that
[1:01:53] manner man you are you all with me
[1:01:55] [Laughter]
[1:01:57] it's a shame I've got to preach after
[1:02:02] this oh my maybe we'll just sing the
[1:02:05] song give and God will give you more you
[1:02:08] know like brother Joe Green when they in
[1:02:09] the camp meeting they would sing that
[1:02:11] and I'll tell you in those North
[1:02:13] Carolina camp meeting missionary and I
[1:02:15] mean back then in those days you would
[1:02:17] have the the missionaries would come in
[1:02:18] with needs and I I remember it as just a
[1:02:21] young boy I would look at those figures
[1:02:23] and I thought my goodness man that that
[1:02:26] that amount of money brother Joy you
[1:02:28] were there some of the years too and you
[1:02:29] remember how that it would come in by
[1:02:32] the end of the meeting all those needs
[1:02:34] would be met thousands upon thousands of
[1:02:36] dollars needs would be met you know why
[1:02:39] cuz God is faithful God is faithful and
[1:02:42] let's just let's just pray about it you
[1:02:43] be in prayer about it and then I believe
[1:02:46] God as we just open our hearts and just
[1:02:48] continuing to move forward God will give
[1:02:51] us the direction if it's all at once if
[1:02:53] it's in phases however that God provides
[1:02:56] because he's Jehovah Gyra and that's
[1:02:58] where we're just going to look to him
[1:02:59] and trust him so amen God bless you if
[1:03:02] you'd like to stand with me
[1:03:16] now and
[1:03:19] uh I'd like you if you turn with me to
[1:03:23] Isaiah chapter
[1:03:24] 6 for
[1:04:12] I think I have the right yes I
[1:04:19] do pardon me there some things got
[1:04:22] changed on me in the back so um
[1:04:26] I want to just
[1:04:28] uh let's go ahead
[1:04:31] and begin with uh verse one if we could

[1:07:10] of even the coming days Lord we give you
[1:07:13] the glory in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:07:15] amen amen let's read here in Isaiah
[1:07:18] chapter 6 and verse
[1:07:23] one in the year that King Uzziah died I
[1:07:28] saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne
[1:07:31] high and lifted up and his train filled
[1:07:35] the temple above it stood the sarapin
[1:07:39] each one had six wings with Twain he
[1:07:42] covered his face and with Twain he
[1:07:45] covered his feet and with Twain he did
[1:07:48] fly and one Cried unto another and said
[1:07:52] holy holy holy is the Lord of
[1:07:56] host the whole earth is full of his
[1:08:00] glory and the post of the door moved at
[1:08:04] the voice of him that cried and the
[1:08:06] house was filled with smoke glory to God
[1:08:10] then said I woe is me for I am undone
[1:08:15] because I am a man of unclean lips and
[1:08:18] dwell in the midst of a people of
[1:08:20] unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the
[1:08:23] king the Lord of host then flew one of
[1:08:27] the sarapin unto me having a live coal
[1:08:31] in his hand which he had taken with the
[1:08:34] tongs from off the Altar and he laid it
[1:08:37] upon my mouth and said Lo this hath
[1:08:40] touched thy lips and thine iniquity is
[1:08:43] taken away and thy sin is purged praise
[1:08:46] the Lord also I heard the L the voice of
[1:08:48] the Lord saying whom shall I send and
[1:08:52] who will go for us then said I here am I
[1:08:57] send me amen may God bless you and bless
[1:09:01] the reading of the word as you're being
[1:09:04] seated I'd like to just take a little
[1:09:07] simple thought here this
[1:09:11] morning on becoming a
[1:09:13] witness and uh this was certainly not
[1:09:16] what I had planned to or thought that I
[1:09:19] was going to speak on here this morning
[1:09:21] but we're just going to move with him
[1:09:25] here this
[1:09:26] morning you know when you the background
[1:09:30] in this particular setting and we look
[1:09:32] at it that here you have um Uzziah was a
[1:09:37] great king one that was used greatly by
[1:09:41] God there were many victories that were
[1:09:45] uh won within his first few years of
[1:09:49] reigning because he put God first in in
[1:09:52] everything and it was such an it had
[1:09:55] such an impact upon Isaiah's life you
[1:09:59] know Isaiah could could look at Uzziah
[1:10:02] and my he just he marveled at at at you
[1:10:06] know what he was seeing God do through
[1:10:09] uzziah's life but you know then it came
[1:10:12] to a place to where that Uzziah got
[1:10:15] lifted up and you know any time that a
[1:10:19] person begins to become and feel um
[1:10:23] comfortable in their walk with God and I
[1:10:25] I don't I want you to understand we're
[1:10:27] not talking about uh being in a sent of
[1:10:30] unrest the gospel comes to bring rest
[1:10:35] and
[1:10:35] stability it's not a false rest remember
[1:10:40] that it says in this day that when
[1:10:42] destruction is at hand in the book of
[1:10:44] Thessalonians it says they will say
[1:10:47] peace peace and destruction is Swift in
[1:10:50] The Book of Jeremiah it would say that
[1:10:53] there was even temporary he heing
[1:10:55] because the false prophets were saying
[1:10:58] peace this is not going to happen
[1:11:00] there's not going to be a carrying away
[1:11:02] and um you know all of that was to
[1:11:05] appease the spirit and and the mind of
[1:11:09] man but it it had nothing for the soul
[1:11:12] because you see the real peace and the
[1:11:14] real rest is that that comes to your
[1:11:17] soul to where that you know the god of
[1:11:22] the Bible and you have met him in a
[1:11:24] person way and your life has become
[1:11:28] settled and there's a rest in your life
[1:11:31] that no matter the circumstances tests
[1:11:34] or trials there is a piece that passes
[1:11:39] all understanding it's a piece that
[1:11:42] comes that when you yourself don't even
[1:11:45] know how is it and where is this of such
[1:11:49] a peace in the midst of this of even to
[1:11:52] where that you can have an Outlook that
[1:11:54] looks beyond beyond what you're seeing
[1:11:57] and but yet you realize there's a source
[1:11:59] it's a hidden Source remember Faith
[1:12:02] finds a source that no other sense can
[1:12:06] find when the woman of sarapa when she
[1:12:10] came to the Lord Jesus and she said thou
[1:12:13] son of David and she's she's looking to
[1:12:15] him Lord Heal or thou son of David heal
[1:12:18] my daughter she had no claims on him as
[1:12:20] son of David and even when he said that
[1:12:23] you know this is not even for you uh
[1:12:25] your your dogs Gentiles but she said
[1:12:28] true Lord but we the dogs eat the crumbs
[1:12:32] that fall from the master's table Faith
[1:12:35] itself her her own person had a lot of
[1:12:39] hindrances she could have taken you know
[1:12:41] the route of that well you spoke against
[1:12:43] my culture you've spoke against my
[1:12:45] ethnicity you've uh you've offended me
[1:12:48] uh this is racist this is she could have
[1:12:50] taken that because those Spirits were
[1:12:52] there you say how do you know it because
[1:12:54] even when Jesus came to The Well of
[1:12:56] Samaria there wasn't it was something
[1:12:58] that was there even between the Jews and
[1:13:00] the Samaritans Satan's always in the
[1:13:03] business of stirring up stink and
[1:13:06] dividing because remember this is where
[1:13:09] this is where he works his strength is
[1:13:11] to bring division but you see it takes
[1:13:14] the love of God to bring a real true
[1:13:18] unity and there's a peace that within
[1:13:21] the midst of it that this this little
[1:13:23] lady she said thou son of David you know
[1:13:27] just to to come and to to touch and to
[1:13:29] you can make my my uh my daughter well
[1:13:33] but when she called him
[1:13:36] Lord that was different she had claims
[1:13:40] on him as Lord son of David was for the
[1:13:42] Jews but now here she is the approach is
[1:13:46] provided you know you've got to have the
[1:13:48] right approach it's like if you were
[1:13:50] going in to see the king or you're going
[1:13:52] in let's say even in this day and age
[1:13:54] these are simple things but these are
[1:13:55] things sometimes that's left out you
[1:13:57] don't go into the bank for the loan with
[1:14:00] a t-shirt on and flipflops you go in
[1:14:02] there you're ready you're in there to do
[1:14:04] business you you look like you're going
[1:14:05] in for something is that right there's
[1:14:08] approach there's approach when you come
[1:14:10] in before a king you just don't walk
[1:14:11] into a king or or some if you went over
[1:14:14] to one of the uh uh you know the
[1:14:16] Patriarchs or matriarchs or of the
[1:14:18] monarchy in England you just don't walk
[1:14:19] up to him and say hey buddy how are you
[1:14:22] doing Charles how you doing buddy you
[1:14:23] don't walk in like that there's rightful
[1:14:25] approach and that's the same way it is
[1:14:28] with God there's an approach to God and
[1:14:31] and we can't circumvent that approach
[1:14:33] there's no way there's no shortcut it's
[1:14:37] it's a clear direct way to the throne of
[1:14:40] God there's an approach and that
[1:14:42] approach is through the shed blood of
[1:14:45] the Lamb he has made a New and Living
[1:14:48] Way for you and I there's an approach we
[1:14:51] could not approach God but God came down
[1:14:55] and became one of us and he made a way
[1:14:58] through the shedding of the blood that
[1:15:00] you and I could come to him that the
[1:15:03] spirit that was within the blood could
[1:15:06] call you and I to repentance and that
[1:15:08] same blood that life sanctifying us and
[1:15:12] bringing us into that place with God in
[1:15:15] a union he has provided the way of
[1:15:19] approach he is that way of
[1:15:22] approach so there's a peace that that an
[1:15:26] individual can have even when you're
[1:15:28] going through storms of life it's a
[1:15:31] peace that is within you know people
[1:15:33] will spend many many much money and
[1:15:36] everything to try to find some source of
[1:15:38] peace and try to find you know some way
[1:15:41] to get their minds off of it but I'm
[1:15:43] going to tell you at the end of the day
[1:15:45] when it comes down to there's no other
[1:15:48] peace that you will find on this Earth
[1:15:52] outside of the Lord Jesus Christ it's
[1:15:55] not an Earthly peace it's not a it's not
[1:15:58] a a something that is of the just census
[1:16:01] it's a pieace because that is a
[1:16:04] characteristic of who he is he is the
[1:16:07] Prince of
[1:16:09] Peace that's we can try to find it we
[1:16:12] can try to you know settle it here and
[1:16:14] try to settle it there so there's no
[1:16:16] other place because he is the Prince of
[1:16:18] Peace he is the word there's no other
[1:16:20] place of settl and satisfaction outside
[1:16:23] of the word amen joining a church will
[1:16:26] never do it it'll never satisfy it
[1:16:29] because God's God's intention is that
[1:16:32] that peace we would receive as he said
[1:16:35] come unto me all your heavy laden and I
[1:16:38] will give you rest for your souls in
[1:16:42] other words you will no longer be under
[1:16:44] a laboring and a striving and and and
[1:16:47] here you are laboring under a load of
[1:16:49] sin and laboring under these Desires in
[1:16:51] your life but come unto me that that's
[1:16:53] the that's the request
[1:16:55] he didn't ask you and I make yourself
[1:16:57] good enough make yourself good enough
[1:17:00] but he said come unto me and I will give
[1:17:03] you rest it's the same rest that he
[1:17:06] spoke of in Isaiah that would take place
[1:17:09] it took place on the day of Pentecost it
[1:17:11] gave them a rest from their worldly ways
[1:17:15] from the world you know Peter never ever
[1:17:17] had to worry about going back out and
[1:17:20] acting the way that he used to act
[1:17:22] because you know why that old life that
[1:17:25] old man was cut
[1:17:28] off there was a rest that had come to
[1:17:31] him that rest that settl that you know
[1:17:35] that you've met God in a personal way
[1:17:37] listen friends I'm talking deeper than
[1:17:39] just knowing doctrines I'm talking
[1:17:41] deeper than just knowing scriptures I'm
[1:17:43] talking something more than just knowing
[1:17:45] quotes all of those things have their
[1:17:47] place and they're important but if you
[1:17:49] have all of that and you don't know him
[1:17:51] and you don't meet Jesus Christ you've
[1:17:53] missed what it's all about
[1:17:55] [Applause]
[1:17:58] and like Isaiah when he come down and
[1:18:00] Uzziah raises to a place a man got so
[1:18:05] comfortable till he he stopped worrying
[1:18:09] about and concerned about his walk with
[1:18:13] God his walk with God started to just
[1:18:16] little by little it just started to no I
[1:18:19] don't know what come into his house I
[1:18:21] don't know what come into his heart a
[1:18:22] lot of things could have come in because
[1:18:26] maybe his prayer life that's where it
[1:18:27] started letting down CU you know your
[1:18:29] prayer life is your radar screen Jesus
[1:18:32] said pray
[1:18:33] always right praying Paul said that in
[1:18:36] Ephesians 6 we're to pray always that's
[1:18:38] part of our Armament it's like a radar
[1:18:42] screen that you can see of what's coming
[1:18:44] on because prayer itself is also what
[1:18:47] directs you in the promises of God when
[1:18:49] God begins to speak to your heart those
[1:18:51] are things that all of a sudden out of
[1:18:52] this service that'll resonate in your
[1:18:54] heart that maybe nobody else got that
[1:18:57] point or it was expressed to them like
[1:18:59] it was to you but it becomes a promise
[1:19:02] to you that you begin to pray
[1:19:04] about that's why the prophet said you
[1:19:06] can always tell how the church is
[1:19:08] heading and the direction by how they're
[1:19:10] praying because that's part of the radar
[1:19:13] screen God drops things on you and I
[1:19:15] that we would pray because that's the
[1:19:17] law of the scripture seek and you shall
[1:19:19] find is that right knock and it shall be
[1:19:22] open unto you so we find these these
[1:19:24] principles that are that are here but
[1:19:26] yet Uzziah had become so comfortable he
[1:19:29] had let down and no wonder where the
[1:19:32] prophet of God would tell us like this
[1:19:33] he said we should always when a man
[1:19:36] recognizes and I'll say man woman any
[1:19:38] believer you recognize you have
[1:19:41] influence there's an influence of God
[1:19:43] upon your life and through your life we
[1:19:45] must be ever so careful God let me stay
[1:19:49] in that place to where there can be the
[1:19:52] influence of God through my life not my
[1:19:56] influence that's our that's our battle
[1:19:58] we don't want we don't want one
[1:20:00] another's Spirit we don't want one
[1:20:02] another's
[1:20:03] ideas right we don't want one another's
[1:20:06] ideas or this is what the message is and
[1:20:08] this is what it is and and it begins to
[1:20:10] swing back and forth like a pendulum and
[1:20:12] it's B this way now now we're over this
[1:20:14] way now we're on this we don't want that
[1:20:16] we we we we come to a place that the
[1:20:18] word is to bring stability to our
[1:20:22] lives not to where we're chasing ing
[1:20:25] after this and chasing after that is to
[1:20:27] recognize who is in our midst who it is
[1:20:30] that's speaking to you and I and that
[1:20:33] God surrender our all to
[1:20:36] him that's what this message come to do
[1:20:39] is to introduce us to Jesus Christ This
[1:20:43] is why one of the closing statements in
[1:20:45] the message leadership this song that
[1:20:48] the prophet sings God be with you till
[1:20:51] we meet again hallelujah hallelujah
[1:20:54] that's a reality of where it brings and
[1:20:57] you and I are presented with now I want
[1:20:59] to say it like this this is where when
[1:21:01] Uzziah he come to a place and when we're
[1:21:04] looking at this here that you know he he
[1:21:07] got to that place what a disappointment
[1:21:09] this was to Isaiah you know sometimes in
[1:21:12] becoming a witness and remaining a
[1:21:15] faithful witness you know when the Bible
[1:21:18] says in the Book of Revelations chapter
[1:21:19] 1 he is the faithful witness is that
[1:21:23] right amen and you know what even as be
[1:21:26] be being a witness sometimes let me just
[1:21:27] say like this you might look at the
[1:21:29] title this morning becoming a witness
[1:21:31] and think well I already am a witness I
[1:21:34] have met all of these qualities I have
[1:21:36] met everything that God has laid out for
[1:21:38] me to do well the word will allow you
[1:21:40] and I to examine that but I want to
[1:21:42] remind you that even when it comes to
[1:21:44] things in our life that you and I are
[1:21:47] not in control of as far as when
[1:21:49] offenses come when things come our way
[1:21:52] and Satan's objective if he can is to
[1:21:55] take things and move in your life to
[1:21:58] where all the channels become so bogged
[1:22:01] down with stones that's right do you
[1:22:04] remember the wells that Abraham dug in
[1:22:07] the Book of Genesis Abraham dug these
[1:22:11] Wells but the Philistines stopped them
[1:22:14] up they threw rocks down them a lot of
[1:22:17] things can accumulate in our life over
[1:22:20] time one rock well it doesn't matter two
[1:22:22] rocks three very soon over time
[1:22:25] and we can't get no water out of it you
[1:22:27] remember he's the vine we're the
[1:22:30] branches think this is where that in
[1:22:32] becoming a witness we never ever leave
[1:22:35] the foundation of of who we are what God
[1:22:39] has called us to and Lord I do not want
[1:22:42] to depart from being a source that
[1:22:45] others could draw through as well as
[1:22:48] being a channel that God could use me a
[1:22:51] channel maybe it isn't for you to speak
[1:22:53] it isn't for you to lay on hands but
[1:22:55] it's for somebody to look at your life
[1:22:57] and say that's a real Christian cuz let
[1:22:59] me tell you your testimony speaks louder
[1:23:02] than your
[1:23:05] words Uzziah had a
[1:23:08] testimony but he got lifted
[1:23:11] up he got lifted up with pride right he
[1:23:15] failed to remember it was God who led
[1:23:18] you in those battles it was God who
[1:23:20] overcome it's God who brought you this
[1:23:22] far he got lift
[1:23:25] up then he got so lifted up to a place
[1:23:28] with pride to where he could not even be
[1:23:33] corrected he came in with the priest to
[1:23:36] offer incense that was not his
[1:23:40] position right if God listen God has
[1:23:44] within it your position my position our
[1:23:47] calling we can't take somebody else's
[1:23:49] calling but we're if we're faithful in
[1:23:52] what God has called you and I to do amen
[1:23:55] let me tell you the greatest I think I
[1:23:57] quoted this to you before it's come from
[1:23:59] you know uh Teddy Roosevelt or whoever
[1:24:01] you know you look it up and they say a
[1:24:03] multitude of people said it but anyhow
[1:24:04] it's still true when you go to compare
[1:24:07] yourself to somebody else that's the
[1:24:09] greatest thief of Joy we're never to
[1:24:12] compare ourselves with one
[1:24:14] another we compare ourselves with the
[1:24:17] word amen I'll just tell you right now
[1:24:20] I'm grateful that I that God did not
[1:24:22] call me to the ministry of brother ROM
[1:24:25] right I'm grateful for that but s you
[1:24:28] wouldn't want it no when I look at the
[1:24:30] responsibility when I look at how that
[1:24:32] he himself God ordained him and gifted
[1:24:35] him to look in that other realm I'm I'm
[1:24:38] not interested in that when I say I'm
[1:24:40] not interested in it because God hasn't
[1:24:42] called me to that the prophet himself
[1:24:44] did not even want that to where he would
[1:24:47] come home from a meeting and he would be
[1:24:49] locked in the bathroom for days battling
[1:24:52] them Spirits right because the spirits
[1:24:55] had lost in the in those meetings lost
[1:24:59] Victory after Victory but how many
[1:25:02] wanted they thirsted after that all they
[1:25:05] saw was what was up
[1:25:08] here people's got a sign here and a sign
[1:25:10] here oh it's all up here and they sought
[1:25:13] after it went after it but to realize
[1:25:16] this ministry that God sent in this last
[1:25:19] day this was not just a gift this was
[1:25:23] not a gift of PR prophecy
[1:25:25] right that was the spirit of God in the
[1:25:30] form of the son of manise the Lord are
[1:25:33] you with me because the prophet tells us
[1:25:36] clearly bringing that distinction he
[1:25:38] says prophecy is to be judged before
[1:25:41] it's ever received is that right he also
[1:25:44] said if something spoke out in the
[1:25:46] church it's to be wrote down and be
[1:25:49] judged whether or not it comes to
[1:25:51] pass come on that's scriptural here now
[1:25:54] yeah that's right it's holding right to
[1:25:55] the word of God but he said nobody
[1:25:59] stands before a prophet cuz a prophet
[1:26:01] has that with the word of
[1:26:05] God is that
[1:26:07] right but here Uzziah had come to a
[1:26:09] place where he just got he got loose
[1:26:11] with it he got loose even with his walk
[1:26:14] what a disappointment it was to Isaiah
[1:26:17] right he could not you know Uzziah could
[1:26:19] not be corrected he was taking somebody
[1:26:22] else's place and and you know moving on
[1:26:24] beyond that and I could deal with that
[1:26:26] for a time but that's not what I'm after
[1:26:28] I I just feel pressed in my heart here
[1:26:30] this morning that I was Isaiah he was a
[1:26:33] one that no doubt he was wounded he had
[1:26:37] there had been a failure that where what
[1:26:40] he had had such he had placed his stock
[1:26:42] so high in a man and now he's seen a
[1:26:45] failure but you see listen you can place
[1:26:48] this is why the prophet said you can get
[1:26:50] your stock in man to such a place and
[1:26:53] God will will allow that man to make a
[1:26:55] mistake to shake your confidence back to
[1:26:58] where it needs to
[1:27:00] be come on Friends everyone is flesh and
[1:27:04] blood James said Elijah was a man
[1:27:07] subject unto lack passion such as we are
[1:27:10] even when they came to Paul and that
[1:27:13] great miracle was done they raised him
[1:27:15] up oh the gods have come down against us
[1:27:17] what did the word do it did the same
[1:27:19] thing that it did in the Book of
[1:27:21] Revelations it said stand on your feet
[1:27:24] do not worship me but worship God
[1:27:30] only
[1:27:32] Hallelujah any true Ministry any true
[1:27:35] man of God any true servant of God any
[1:27:37] true son and daughter of God will never
[1:27:40] take praise unto themselves but it's
[1:27:43] always to Jesus
[1:27:47] Christ Isaiah's got a he's got a
[1:27:50] dilemma Isaiah can either sit and stew
[1:27:54] and be mad at Uzziah and say how in the
[1:27:57] world could he have let me down that's
[1:27:59] good how could he have done that that's
[1:28:00] good he's got a choice let me tell you
[1:28:03] something friends we've all had people
[1:28:04] that has let us down and we've let
[1:28:06] others
[1:28:07] down maybe we don't know about it but
[1:28:10] it's all you know why because we're all
[1:28:12] Flesh and Blood that's not a compromise
[1:28:14] that's not putting weakness out there
[1:28:16] but I'm just saying that we need the
[1:28:18] grace of God you know what you cannot
[1:28:20] give forgiveness to somebody else in
[1:28:22] Grace only according to the depth that
[1:28:24] you know and you've received if you've
[1:28:26] received that much that's all you can
[1:28:27] extend to somebody else but when you
[1:28:29] know him in the power of redemption and
[1:28:32] forgiveness of his grace then you can
[1:28:35] extend that unpardonable that that which
[1:28:38] is not even merited you're able to
[1:28:40] extend it because there's a Greater
[1:28:43] Grace on the inside of your life in your
[1:28:46] heart yes sir Hallelujah so
[1:28:50] good is that right the Bible said that
[1:28:53] he has put our our sin oh You' so far
[1:28:56] removed him as the East is from the West
[1:28:58] he put him in the sea of forgetfulness
[1:29:00] now I realize you and I we do not have
[1:29:02] that ability to have a part within us
[1:29:04] that we can forget things but by the
[1:29:06] grace of God there is a healing bomb in
[1:29:08] Gilead that comes to minister to
[1:29:11] offenses and give Grace to where there
[1:29:13] no longer is a sting in our life any
[1:29:16] longer we might see a person but we see
[1:29:19] that God's Grace has allowed you and I
[1:29:22] to have a release in our life that we
[1:29:24] might be a real
[1:29:26] witness cuz you're going to be a witness
[1:29:28] for something you have people come up to
[1:29:30] you on the job sometimes they're
[1:29:32] Witnesses of their bitterness towards
[1:29:33] the boss yeah that's right or they
[1:29:36] Witnesses of their bitterness between
[1:29:38] about their husband or their wife or
[1:29:39] their disappointments in their family
[1:29:41] and they're Witnesses of that but we are
[1:29:44] called to be Witnesses of the good
[1:29:47] news and in order to carry the good news
[1:29:50] our feet must be shot with the
[1:29:52] preparation of the Gospel
[1:29:54] in other words we're no longer standing
[1:29:57] just in Earthly means or in Earthly
[1:29:59] birth but we have been raised to
[1:30:01] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and
[1:30:05] that's our standing with almighty God
[1:30:07] we've got a message to carry that no
[1:30:10] matter how great your circumstance is no
[1:30:13] matter how tied up you are no matter
[1:30:15] what the offense is God's grace is
[1:30:20] greater yes sir Hallelujah
[1:30:24] Oh by we want to give that inside man
[1:30:28] that's who we want to give a chance
[1:30:30] to then inside man that's that's a place
[1:30:33] that we we battle with not so much that
[1:30:38] we battle with the inside man but it's
[1:30:41] recognizing that in each
[1:30:43] situation like we were living looking at
[1:30:46] in one way on Thursday night we can look
[1:30:48] with our eyes hear with our ears we can
[1:30:53] feel things
[1:30:54] we can imagine things and we can get
[1:30:58] caught in those
[1:31:00] Realms we can get caught there because
[1:31:04] those Realms have not yet been redeemed
[1:31:06] that's why we're waiting on the adoption
[1:31:08] of the body that's right but once that
[1:31:10] Soul has been redeemed this is where the
[1:31:12] scripture said bless the Lord all my
[1:31:14] soul and forget not all his benefits I'm
[1:31:16] who the Lord that forgiveth all thine
[1:31:18] iniquities Health all thine diseases he
[1:31:20] crowneth thyy life with loving kindness
[1:31:23] who
[1:31:25] renth your strength as an
[1:31:28] eagle Hallelujah I'm talking about not
[1:31:31] forgetting God's benefits Upon Our Life
[1:31:33] to where when here we can be in a place
[1:31:36] where we're all hinged
[1:31:39] in like
[1:31:43] Isaiah Isaiah had been
[1:31:46] disappointed right Isaiah had a
[1:31:49] choice has it all been
[1:31:52] wrong is everything wrong
[1:31:54] that's good do I go back to what God I
[1:31:57] know God brought me out of certain
[1:31:59] things in my life do I just say this is
[1:32:02] all wrong and go back to living that
[1:32:05] way all of these are going
[1:32:08] on within you
[1:32:11] Isaiah it's going on let me tell you
[1:32:16] Uzziah was a
[1:32:18] representation of the
[1:32:20] church down Through the Ages
[1:32:25] and when God would visit and send his
[1:32:27] word there would be a people that would
[1:32:30] rise up a messenger would hear what the
[1:32:32] spirit said to the church and would that
[1:32:35] would be released upon that generation
[1:32:38] and there were lives that were in tune
[1:32:42] with that word that was to be expressed
[1:32:44] what was that word the same Jesus Christ
[1:32:47] the same yesterday today and forever and
[1:32:50] they would rise to that
[1:32:52] word but but as that age would go on and
[1:32:56] even that which God would move where a
[1:32:59] move of God would go in to a place and
[1:33:02] to a church to a life even as what was
[1:33:04] started with there in Luther's Ministry
[1:33:07] and Wesley's Ministry but after they had
[1:33:10] passed off the
[1:33:13] scene just like what happened after the
[1:33:17] day of Pentecost the very first entry in
[1:33:20] that Ephesian age in the Book of
[1:33:23] Revelation is says remember from whence
[1:33:26] Thou Art
[1:33:27] Fallen they had already drifted away
[1:33:32] from
[1:33:33] Pentecost now let me remind you
[1:33:36] Pentecost is not shouting jumping
[1:33:39] dancing and
[1:33:41] running I believe in all that but that's
[1:33:43] not what Pentecost is Pentecost is God
[1:33:48] Pentecost is the sounding of the Jubilee
[1:33:51] trumpet where you're in inheritance is
[1:33:55] coming back to you and you are being
[1:33:57] called back to your land to live as a
[1:34:00] son and daughter of God and when you
[1:34:02] hear it you might dance a little bit
[1:34:04] when you get back to it you might shout
[1:34:06] a little bit because that's just
[1:34:08] something that might come out of how
[1:34:10] you're made up but the importance of
[1:34:12] what Pentecost is is a real
[1:34:16] experience with Jesus
[1:34:18] Christ where it's God tabernacling
[1:34:21] inside of your life
[1:34:24] living his own life through
[1:34:28] you that's what Pentecost is when I
[1:34:31] saying that word I'm not talking about
[1:34:33] isusa street that isusa the return of
[1:34:36] the baptism of the Holy Spirit but
[1:34:38] remember that only made way for the
[1:34:41] person of Jesus Christ himself that's
[1:34:44] according to the word that's right right
[1:34:46] this is the advancement of the Gospel
[1:34:50] this is where we're not a people that's
[1:34:51] rallying around gifts but we are people
[1:34:53] people that have been rallied around the
[1:34:55] Vindicated word in this hour and signs
[1:34:58] and wonders follow them that
[1:35:01] believe and when God needs to speak
[1:35:03] through a gift he's got
[1:35:11] them Lord that's
[1:35:15] right you know the
[1:35:17] gifts brother BR said they've been
[1:35:19] planned to place on the mantle sometimes
[1:35:21] that quote's been misused right and let
[1:35:24] me tell you it's been
[1:35:25] misused when God said he when when the
[1:35:28] prophet said he been placed on the
[1:35:29] mantle he talks about their imposition
[1:35:31] not in
[1:35:33] storage that's good that's good are you
[1:35:36] hearing me now sir let's say what a
[1:35:38] prophet said and the way he said it
[1:35:40] let's quote the whole
[1:35:41] quote like I told one brother I said
[1:35:43] anybody knows a southern boy when you
[1:35:45] hang up a gun on a wall that gun ain't a
[1:35:48] something that's just hanging there like
[1:35:50] the gun over Cracker Barrel they'll take
[1:35:52] that gun off the wall they'll shoot a
[1:35:53] psome they'll shoot a raccoon they'll
[1:35:55] even shoot a deer it's not there for
[1:35:57] show that's just where they put it they
[1:36:00] can grab it when they need it Hallelujah
[1:36:02] and that's the way the Holy Spirit has
[1:36:05] put the gifts in position in this
[1:36:09] hour so that it's not a bunch of
[1:36:15] confusion when my wife and I received
[1:36:17] our gifts guess what they're not sitting
[1:36:20] around in boxes we're not tripping over
[1:36:22] saucepans we're not stumbling over stock
[1:36:25] pots what happened to them you put them
[1:36:27] where they belong and there's times when
[1:36:30] she's cooking some potatoes up or maybe
[1:36:32] she's cooking up you know some dumplings
[1:36:34] honey you hear that some dumplings and
[1:36:37] when she's cooking them up she'll get
[1:36:38] out of stock pot and she gets the stock
[1:36:41] pot not a saucer we need a stock pot and
[1:36:44] she'll get a saucer out when it's time
[1:36:45] to make gravy she'll get something else
[1:36:48] out when it's time to make mashed
[1:36:49] potatoes let me tell you we are under
[1:36:51] the leadership of the Holy Spirit the
[1:36:54] gifts are not in stage they have been
[1:36:57] put in their place and positioned by the
[1:37:00] word delivered through Mal
[1:37:03] 4 and God inspires and pulls them out as
[1:37:07] needed they're not a show they're in
[1:37:13] use Lord but this Inside Man Inside Man
[1:37:18] Isaiah see God allowed Isaiah to get to
[1:37:20] this
[1:37:21] spot he allowed it
[1:37:24] God permitted things you know God
[1:37:25] permits things in your life and the
[1:37:28] whole thing that God's permitting he all
[1:37:30] listen Satan's objective is to always
[1:37:33] take you even in situations and divert
[1:37:36] your attention from what God's trying to
[1:37:38] show
[1:37:39] you they came to the Red Sea all they
[1:37:42] could do is he is Pharaoh's horses and
[1:37:44] oh no you brought us out here to kill us
[1:37:47] oh you did all this and right see Satan
[1:37:50] was diverting their attention right to
[1:37:53] the negative right but here God did
[1:37:57] something in their midst that was for
[1:38:00] them to build their faith right they
[1:38:03] didn't not all of them caught that but
[1:38:05] you see if you can we can recognize it
[1:38:08] Satan is always trying to divert our
[1:38:12] attention from what's the most important
[1:38:16] thing look when the Lord Jesus came many
[1:38:20] were caught with the Miracles that's
[1:38:22] they followed him
[1:38:24] and Jesus what did he tell him you've
[1:38:25] not followed me because of the word you
[1:38:27] come because of fishes and
[1:38:29] Loaves it was all about the Miracles you
[1:38:32] know what the Miracles were it was all
[1:38:33] about
[1:38:35] them chasing after a miracle chasing
[1:38:38] after a sign chasing after a Wonder a
[1:38:40] wicked and adulterous generation seeketh
[1:38:42] after such Brother Sam you're saying we
[1:38:44] not to believe in signs and wonders we
[1:38:46] sure we believe in signs and wond but
[1:38:47] never does it say in the word that we
[1:38:49] seek for signs and wonders they follow
[1:38:54] amen is that right they follow it's
[1:38:56] according to needs is that right you and
[1:38:59] I do not prescribe when it's needed God
[1:39:01] knows when it's needed that's why we
[1:39:03] want to be a real effectual witness
[1:39:05] because God might have you tomorrow
[1:39:07] regardless of your feelings your toast
[1:39:09] might be burned tomorrow your coffee is
[1:39:11] not right and God has called you to pray
[1:39:14] for somebody else who's in need that's
[1:39:17] good and you have to lay aside your
[1:39:19] feelings and the discomforts of the
[1:39:21] morning and stand there as a son
[1:39:23] daughter of God to know wait a minute
[1:39:25] this situation has been presented I'm
[1:39:27] not here by chance but I'm here to
[1:39:30] represent the Living
[1:39:33] God don't let your feelings determine
[1:39:36] your
[1:39:37] yielding yield based on who the word has
[1:39:40] made you amen that's perfect Faith
[1:39:43] mastering every circumstance we're
[1:39:45] looking at the ways we're looking at the
[1:39:47] mountains the greatest circumstances
[1:39:49] that are to be mastered is our own
[1:39:51] thinking our own feeling our own
[1:39:54] abilities and perfect Faith looks beyond
[1:39:56] that and says God that did it for me the
[1:39:59] God that I know is God steal for this
[1:40:08] situation but he always wants to divert
[1:40:11] Isaiah had a choice Isaiah you can
[1:40:15] either roll in that
[1:40:18] hurt let me tell you something hurt's a
[1:40:20] real thing friends
[1:40:24] yes it is I've been in meetings
[1:40:26] sometimes and things I was not even
[1:40:28] aware of and I get into a meeting and I
[1:40:30] get there a little bit later and I
[1:40:32] realize Something's Happened in a
[1:40:34] certain location and I think oh Lord I
[1:40:36] wish I didn't even know about that
[1:40:38] hadn't heard about it because
[1:40:40] immediately when you hear those things I
[1:40:41] think about young people and then you
[1:40:43] got young people that are in that
[1:40:44] meeting and you know you don't try to
[1:40:46] reach out what can I do you just you're
[1:40:48] praying because God's got all that are
[1:40:50] together there a lot of ministry a lot
[1:40:53] of but you're
[1:40:55] burden because sometimes Satan will take
[1:40:58] a wound and let me tell you if you don't
[1:41:00] get a wound cleared out it'll
[1:41:05] canker a wound is a deadly thing let me
[1:41:10] tell you something you can go to a
[1:41:11] doctor and you can have a wound out here
[1:41:13] I've got a I've got a scar right here of
[1:41:15] where that I cut myself with a Swiss
[1:41:16] knife trying to do something
[1:41:19] dumb you know trying to work trying to
[1:41:22] cut out some cardboard things this was
[1:41:23] back years ago back when I was 19 and
[1:41:26] that that I don't know what you call
[1:41:28] that ATT tendon or ligament or whatever
[1:41:29] was popping up through there and the
[1:41:30] guys looked at me and said Browning you
[1:41:32] need to go to the emergency I it be all
[1:41:33] right bandaid be all right buddy it'd be
[1:41:35] all right you know never had stitches in
[1:41:36] my life but I got a scar
[1:41:41] there that scar has always remind
[1:41:44] me of what happened right I don't ever
[1:41:47] play around with knives like that
[1:41:50] again but you know if I to let that go
[1:41:54] and my old my other buddies with
[1:41:56] football wouldn't have said hey you know
[1:41:57] you're going man you might Mis practice
[1:41:59] tonight but you're
[1:42:00] going threw me in the van and we went
[1:42:02] and I'm I'm in
[1:42:05] shock if I don't let that
[1:42:07] go and and even after they stitched it
[1:42:10] up you know they put that stuff on there
[1:42:12] you know the stuff they go in there
[1:42:13] first of all they start cleaning the
[1:42:14] wound right that's right right you got
[1:42:17] to clean it first you can't just start
[1:42:19] stitching it you got to get in case all
[1:42:21] the thing anything that could CA
[1:42:23] that's foreign to that area that could
[1:42:26] cause an
[1:42:27] infection man that
[1:42:29] hurt you know when you go when you have
[1:42:32] to start a cleansing to take place it
[1:42:35] hurts dying to self hurts admitting
[1:42:39] you're wrong I'm wrong well that hurts
[1:42:43] Come On It Ain't Easy the flesh does not
[1:42:45] like
[1:42:47] that but they're cleaning it out then
[1:42:49] they stitched it up then I had to go
[1:42:51] back and I had to keep it you know I W
[1:42:53] in the plastic bag for I don't know days
[1:42:55] couple days I couldn't get it wet or
[1:42:56] nothing like that and and then you know
[1:42:58] then then here they would I had to keep
[1:43:00] it clean then they would wrap it up and
[1:43:01] bandage it so I could play I could play
[1:43:03] ball and it would have to be so
[1:43:05] protected and so forth but you know when
[1:43:07] I look at that now there's a scar there
[1:43:10] but you know what that scar is a sign of
[1:43:13] that I've been
[1:43:15] healed there you go that's what it
[1:43:18] is you see your scars are not something
[1:43:21] that that is still speaks of wound when
[1:43:24] there's still a wound that's there it
[1:43:26] can caner it can affect listen friends
[1:43:29] no matter what it is you might have had
[1:43:30] somebody that lets you down you might
[1:43:32] have had something that come your way
[1:43:34] but don't let that stay as a wound let
[1:43:37] it come to the great physician who's
[1:43:40] able to administer the ointment the bomb
[1:43:43] that's needed to take that hurt out of
[1:43:45] your
[1:43:46] life cuz if I hadn't done that this
[1:43:49] right here would never have been
[1:43:53] right and it might eventually led to
[1:43:55] where that moving on up into the
[1:43:57] bloodstream wounds are
[1:44:01] serious and need to be cleaned out you
[1:44:03] know my dad had a wound it was on under
[1:44:05] his by his ankle you know one of the
[1:44:08] ways that they ministered healing to
[1:44:09] that they dressed it and all that other
[1:44:11] stuff out of the when he was in a
[1:44:12] nursing home you know eventually what
[1:44:14] they did they eventually brought what
[1:44:16] they called the treatment on that wound
[1:44:20] in order to regenerate cells they took
[1:44:24] pieces of a
[1:44:26] placenta after birth had come that
[1:44:30] placenta then would go and they would
[1:44:33] they would you know maintain that
[1:44:35] because that that placenta has within it
[1:44:38] properties to regenerate
[1:44:41] growth I want to to say this to you you
[1:44:43] see sometimes as I was saying in
[1:44:45] becoming a witness we can always with
[1:44:47] things in our life we've got to come
[1:44:49] back to the simpleness the place where
[1:44:51] Jesus said except you be uh humbled and
[1:44:54] become as a child you'll never see the
[1:44:56] kingdom of God we should never the Bible
[1:44:58] said be children in Malice but be men in
[1:45:02] understanding we want to allow God to
[1:45:04] administer healing in our life no I
[1:45:06] don't need that I'm a grown boy now I'm
[1:45:08] a grown girl no I don't need that I
[1:45:10] didn't name it claim it we need it the
[1:45:11] prophet himself when he came back off
[1:45:14] the field in June of 1963 he said I'm
[1:45:17] going to stay here and maybe preach a
[1:45:19] few meetings but I need healing in my
[1:45:22] spirit I've lost
[1:45:25] something he was
[1:45:27] wounded that was after the seals were
[1:45:31] open What a Mighty
[1:45:33] Ministry but he showed us how does
[1:45:37] cleansing come Hallelujah you first have
[1:45:39] to acknowledge
[1:45:42] it I'm wounded Isaiah what do you say
[1:45:45] I'm wounded who fault is it Isaiah what
[1:45:48] you eyes you're still not acknowledging
[1:45:50] it
[1:45:51] yet there you go yeah you'll stay there
[1:45:54] Isaiah that's right but but but but but
[1:45:58] but but God I didn't do that Uzziah did
[1:46:01] that but it was your
[1:46:03] confidence your confidence was in the
[1:46:06] wrong place right
[1:46:08] right you know what he's trying to get
[1:46:11] Isaiah to do he's not trying to shame
[1:46:13] Isaiah he's what he's wanting to do is
[1:46:15] make a witness out of
[1:46:18] Isaiah and the only way you can be a
[1:46:21] real true Witness
[1:46:23] is when it all comes home and the
[1:46:27] responsibility if I've looked at
[1:46:29] something wrong if I've held somebody in
[1:46:31] a certain degree if I've looked at this
[1:46:33] way if this
[1:46:36] hurt and say Lord forgive me for putting
[1:46:40] them in a place that you never put them
[1:46:43] in because never will God lead you to
[1:46:46] put a man in a place that would be equal
[1:46:50] to Jesus Christ
[1:46:53] oh I got to get to this man I got to sit
[1:46:55] around this man I need to drink coffee
[1:46:57] with this man oh if I'm around this man
[1:46:59] maybe this man will see no no God does
[1:47:01] not share his glory with no man the
[1:47:04] Bible said no flesh can glory in his
[1:47:07] presence let me give you a quote 1964
[1:47:10] identified Jesus Christ the prophet said
[1:47:13] not even the Flesh of Jesus could glory
[1:47:16] in the presence of God for he said it is
[1:47:18] not I that do these works but my father
[1:47:21] that dwelleth in me I in myself can do
[1:47:24] nothing but what the father showeth me
[1:47:26] those things I
[1:47:28] do so our flesh cannot Glory he might
[1:47:31] work through our
[1:47:34] flesh and he
[1:47:37] does but it's
[1:47:40] him we want that inside man to have a
[1:47:44] chance not the outside we don't want the
[1:47:47] outside we don't want to look cu the
[1:47:48] outside will choose Things based on what
[1:47:50] it sees and what it feels
[1:47:53] outside we'll look at things and man
[1:47:56] look at this like brother Ram will talk
[1:47:58] about he said sometimes he said that
[1:47:59] outside man he said you know he said
[1:48:01] you'll have that he said where he said
[1:48:03] he I was listening to a broadcast the
[1:48:05] other day he said you had a a young
[1:48:07] people on there and he said they were
[1:48:08] talking about oh the most important
[1:48:10] thing is that he would have blue eyes
[1:48:12] and that he that she would have brown
[1:48:13] eyes or that they would do this and do
[1:48:16] that and that ain't even the most
[1:48:17] important
[1:48:19] thing now I want to tell you something
[1:48:22] when brother I'm he that on the
[1:48:25] radio it's like I told a young man that
[1:48:27] was standing in my yard the other day
[1:48:29] and I witnessed to him there for for
[1:48:31] quite a quite a long time and I said you
[1:48:34] know even with these things even among
[1:48:37] young people I don't blame the young
[1:48:39] people I don't blame the young people we
[1:48:42] got to go back to what what's the cause
[1:48:44] of this because everybody wants to try
[1:48:47] to fix something when I taught school
[1:48:48] they wanted to try to give us
[1:48:50] educational programs that would try to
[1:48:52] control sit situations that's right
[1:48:54] that's right give them a green card give
[1:48:55] them a yellow card give them a red card
[1:48:57] give him a this and give him a that and
[1:48:59] give them a this and give them a
[1:49:01] that for their behavior I don't blame
[1:49:05] the young
[1:49:07] people but I look back and I said we got
[1:49:09] to go
[1:49:10] deeper how did this get to where it's
[1:49:14] at that's where things become
[1:49:16] uncomfortable there you go come on yes
[1:49:19] sir he's got to go back till he comes
[1:49:21] back to parent delinquency
[1:49:24] is that right we want to focus on
[1:49:26] problem we need to regulate this
[1:49:27] regulate that but then when we trace it
[1:49:29] back then from parent delinquency it
[1:49:31] comes back to Pulpit
[1:49:33] delinquency men not standing with the
[1:49:36] word of God where the word of God is not
[1:49:39] being preached in its power and
[1:49:41] authority that'll separate a life from
[1:49:44] sin and bring God present in a daddy's
[1:49:47] life in a mama's life to where that home
[1:49:50] comes under the influence and effect of
[1:49:52] the Holy Ghost where it's God not just
[1:49:55] in the church but it's God in the home
[1:49:57] it's God in the husband it's God in the
[1:49:59] wife it's God in Daddy it's God in mom
[1:50:02] and they see god with skin on
[1:50:05] it
[1:50:07] amen that's what this gospel is all
[1:50:09] about it came with power and
[1:50:12] demonstration I'm not ashamed of the
[1:50:14] Gospel of Jesus Christ it's the power of
[1:50:17] God into salvation
[1:50:18] am sometimes they'll look for a building
[1:50:21] in a certain way the prophet said
[1:50:23] they'll look for one it look so
[1:50:24] beautiful and everything I'm not against
[1:50:26] Beauty I'm not against all those things
[1:50:28] but sometimes God might be leading them
[1:50:30] watch how brother says this here he says
[1:50:32] but yet God might be leading them to
[1:50:34] some little
[1:50:36] Mission that's I tell you how how
[1:50:39] blessed you are in your heart if you can
[1:50:42] say God is leading me amen amen
[1:50:46] hallelujah when you're not choosing
[1:50:48] based on your emotions and your feelings
[1:50:51] right come on if brother Rand had his
[1:50:53] choice he wouldn't he would he already
[1:50:55] told us where he would have been he said
[1:50:56] I'd be out there in
[1:50:59] bamp come on even when he got hurt
[1:51:03] wounded a
[1:51:05] complex he was using that wound in that
[1:51:08] complex of I'll just go on up here in
[1:51:10] the mountain then I'll just go on up
[1:51:11] there when God gives me a word I'll stor
[1:51:12] him on down something he always wanted
[1:51:14] to
[1:51:16] do and when something came along the way
[1:51:19] that wounded or affected him he went oh
[1:51:22] but aren't you but look God didn't make
[1:51:24] the decision for the
[1:51:25] prophet God let him know it's your
[1:51:28] choice your choice see God lets Sons and
[1:51:31] Daughters of God make
[1:51:33] choices we can preach a whole series on
[1:51:35] this sometimes the choices we make as a
[1:51:37] son and daughter of God we if we make
[1:51:39] the wrong decision we will have to reap
[1:51:42] the consequences of
[1:51:43] it but it don't change your sunship or
[1:51:46] that's you're a daughter of
[1:51:48] God is that right I tell you I've been
[1:51:51] outside of the will I I want to being in
[1:51:52] his perfect will I don't care Lord if
[1:51:55] even if it's not what I want I want your
[1:51:58] will more than I want my
[1:52:00] wants that's what I want more than
[1:52:02] anything Lord is what you
[1:52:05] want God didn't make the choice for him
[1:52:09] he had to make that choice God said but
[1:52:11] I'll tell you if you go this way your
[1:52:13] wife's going to leave you this is going
[1:52:14] to happen this going to happen but your
[1:52:16] choice your choice right now what if
[1:52:19] brother brandham had kept that wound
[1:52:25] kept that woman you know let me tell you
[1:52:27] something you know how powerful it is as
[1:52:29] a wife and as husband vice versa as a
[1:52:31] spouse one to another this is where we
[1:52:33] come to help one
[1:52:35] another you know if Ahab had had a real
[1:52:40] wife she could have told him stop acting
[1:52:44] like a little boy right stop
[1:52:49] pouting and stand up and be a leader
[1:52:53] M come on you know I'm preaching
[1:52:56] now see he he couldn't get something
[1:52:59] that he wanted he wanted naboth's
[1:53:01] Vineyard right he wanted an inheritance
[1:53:04] that only could be to naboth and his
[1:53:07] people remember the inheritance could
[1:53:08] not pass from One Tribe to
[1:53:11] another and he wanted something that he
[1:53:14] couldn't
[1:53:15] have but you know why he was pouting cuz
[1:53:18] he did that as a little boy that's right
[1:53:20] that's why he never got healed whatever
[1:53:24] that was in his life that was there
[1:53:26] daddy mommy remember his daddy omry and
[1:53:29] all them no doubt they let him get away
[1:53:30] with that they catered to him when all
[1:53:32] that took place that was something in
[1:53:34] his life that followed through in his
[1:53:37] marriage right but he married a woman
[1:53:39] that took advantage of it
[1:53:42] too she showed him she was strong she
[1:53:46] said I'll tell you what I'll do I know
[1:53:48] how to get it for
[1:53:50] you she knew how to cut and make all the
[1:53:53] deceptive moves and everything else in
[1:53:56] order to try to get it but remember the
[1:53:58] Bible said the the wages of sin is death
[1:54:02] a woman that liveth in pleasure is dead
[1:54:05] while she lives that's good she made all
[1:54:07] of these cuts and Corner let me tell you
[1:54:09] something the church World itself will
[1:54:11] make cuts and Corners in order to have
[1:54:13] members but let me tell you the Bible
[1:54:15] says if any man makes Cuts or Corners
[1:54:17] taketh or adth away from this book his
[1:54:21] part will be taken away from The Book of
[1:54:25] Life Hallelujah that's the TR but she
[1:54:28] made these amends in order to try to
[1:54:30] secure that Vineyard what happened death
[1:54:35] right right death God fed her to the
[1:54:37] dogs that's right is that right Ahab
[1:54:40] died in his charot it it matters what's
[1:54:43] on the inside in our
[1:54:46] leading Hallelujah let me just let me
[1:54:50] bring this here to a point
[1:54:53] see ah look at look at Isaiah
[1:54:55] here when he came before the presence of
[1:54:59] God and Isaiah 6 here he is he comes
[1:55:02] into the temple and he's come to the
[1:55:05] temple many
[1:55:08] times but this time it's different prise
[1:55:12] God I guarantee you Isaiah never
[1:55:14] expected to take place in the temple
[1:55:16] what
[1:55:17] happened he was
[1:55:20] discouraged he was wounded yes sir he
[1:55:23] needed
[1:55:24] healing but God had allowed all of this
[1:55:27] to come into
[1:55:28] place to bring
[1:55:31] Isaiah in position right because as long
[1:55:35] as he was leaning upon Uzziah he could
[1:55:38] never be an effectual witness now let me
[1:55:43] say this God's not called you or me to
[1:55:45] be on an island on our own that's right
[1:55:48] the scripture said we are members of one
[1:55:51] body amen just as your finger you know
[1:55:55] the other parts they have their place
[1:55:58] but we must be in position and in the
[1:56:01] body and what God has us to be when
[1:56:05] Isaiah came to that place the Bible says
[1:56:09] he saw the presence of the Lord the
[1:56:11] train filled the temple he saw the same
[1:56:13] thing that John saw on the aisle of
[1:56:14] patmas same thing that Ezekiel Saw
[1:56:17] Isaiah
[1:56:18] saw and when Isaiah hear the post of the
[1:56:22] temple were
[1:56:24] moved at the presence of the
[1:56:27] Lord is't isn't it incredible how God
[1:56:30] can come down and he could move the post
[1:56:32] the pillars of the temple this is these
[1:56:34] were not decorative things these were
[1:56:37] supports isn't an incredible how that
[1:56:40] God himself could take a bush and bring
[1:56:42] it on fire and yet not consume the bush
[1:56:46] right right the bush is on fire but yet
[1:56:50] it doesn't burn isn't it incredible how
[1:56:53] that God can fill a man with the Holy
[1:56:55] Ghost the fire of God and yet it doesn't
[1:56:58] consume the man it consumes his nature
[1:57:02] Hallelujah it changes the man it changes
[1:57:05] you I we are a new creation in Christ
[1:57:08] Jesus yes sir the outside man somebody
[1:57:11] can say hey how you doing so and so and
[1:57:13] they remember you from what you were
[1:57:16] years ago but you have met the fire of
[1:57:19] God and on the inside that fire is is
[1:57:23] burning this out here you might
[1:57:25] recognize by the facial features but
[1:57:28] there's something happened inside here
[1:57:30] that makes this
[1:57:35] different here was
[1:57:38] Isaiah the post was
[1:57:41] moved and he realizes when he comes in
[1:57:43] God's
[1:57:44] presence wo is me I'm
[1:57:48] undone you see the very first thing that
[1:57:51] has to happen
[1:57:53] and I want you just to lock in here just
[1:57:54] these just a couple
[1:57:57] minutes the first
[1:58:00] thing is there has to be a
[1:58:03] confession that's good that's that's
[1:58:05] first see God's giving the order of
[1:58:08] approach his presence remember the Bible
[1:58:10] said the goodness of God leadth us to
[1:58:13] repentance the goodness is
[1:58:16] him he said as a physician he has come
[1:58:19] not to call the righteous but the sick
[1:58:21] into repentance
[1:58:22] the goodness of the Lord is the same
[1:58:24] goodness Moses saw it leads
[1:58:27] us leads us not just say hey you go do
[1:58:29] this leads us when you when you move in
[1:58:32] Repentance it's him leading you and you
[1:58:35] follow as a
[1:58:38] lamb woe is me for I'm undone
[1:58:41] confession and once all the confession
[1:58:43] once the repentance and once all of that
[1:58:46] is is laid
[1:58:47] out then the scripture
[1:58:50] says I'm a man of unclean
[1:58:53] lips now comes a sarapin in verse 6
[1:58:58] having a live coal in his hands which he
[1:59:01] taken from the tongues from off the
[1:59:03] altar now I want to remind
[1:59:06] you the same order that God gave Moses
[1:59:10] in the Tabernacle in the wilderness was
[1:59:13] the same order that was for Solomon's
[1:59:17] Temple and that was man never started
[1:59:22] the fire on the altar right right is
[1:59:25] that right remember God consumed two men
[1:59:29] they were
[1:59:31] priests they had connections in the
[1:59:33] lineage but they came in there and they
[1:59:35] offered Strange Fire
[1:59:39] right right sons of Aaron and God
[1:59:42] consumed them because it wasn't Holy
[1:59:46] Fire right right God's the one who
[1:59:49] started the fire and that fire from the
[1:59:52] altar would be the same fire that would
[1:59:55] move to light the seven golden
[1:59:59] candlesticks one age would be it would
[2:00:02] be a passing from one age to another
[2:00:04] that same fire it shows that there is no
[2:00:08] breaking in the continuity of the fire
[2:00:10] of
[2:00:12] God this is why it says in the Book of
[2:00:14] Romans though some did not believe does
[2:00:16] it hinder God no God's going to fulfill
[2:00:19] his word God will find vessels that are
[2:00:22] ready to be lit by the fire of almighty
[2:00:26] God and that fire that came through
[2:00:28] Calvary that fire passed in to the upper
[2:00:32] room that same fire a sarapin he took a
[2:00:35] living coal and it touched his lips it
[2:00:39] cleansed him you say why did it touch
[2:00:41] his lips CU you got to be able to speak
[2:00:43] right out of the abundance of the heart
[2:00:46] the mouth
[2:00:47] speaketh as a man thinketh in his heart
[2:00:49] so is he it shows what did it come to do
[2:00:52] it come not to just orientate out here
[2:00:54] that we would say the right things but
[2:00:56] it come to where as it's te touching
[2:00:58] there that down here on the inside man's
[2:01:01] heart would be
[2:01:02] changed you understand God will never
[2:01:05] rip sin out of your life without
[2:01:08] confession you've got to confess your
[2:01:10] sin that's right even if things if
[2:01:12] you've allowed things to accumulate in
[2:01:14] your life there's only one way to return
[2:01:17] back to the joy of the Lord you've got
[2:01:18] to confess you're
[2:01:20] wrong Lord I'm I'm I'm undone and say
[2:01:23] Lord I need I need Lord a refreshing
[2:01:26] Lord in my spirit listen friends we just
[2:01:29] don't need to come and to feel good but
[2:01:31] we need to say Lord is there something
[2:01:34] that's wrong within my life there's a
[2:01:36] check up here I'm not saying that there
[2:01:38] is but if there's things that's
[2:01:40] unconfessed and it's not right and we
[2:01:42] make excuses for it we've got to confess
[2:01:46] it in order for God to move amen
[2:01:52] and let me just tell you we can allow
[2:01:55] things can accumulate things can come so
[2:01:58] easily but this is why the grace of God
[2:02:01] comes down to speak to our hearts
[2:02:04] sometimes it isn't I've been looking at
[2:02:06] this or I've done this or I fall this
[2:02:08] sometimes I didn't even that sometimes
[2:02:10] we've just become so gripped with
[2:02:13] negative
[2:02:14] things to we're out of our mouth
[2:02:17] everything is negative and all this and
[2:02:19] all that listen listen because you're
[2:02:21] rounded by negativity this birth this
[2:02:24] first birth is a negative birth but I
[2:02:28] want to remind you if this is the
[2:02:30] negative the
[2:02:32] positive there's a
[2:02:35] positive you can't get a negative unless
[2:02:38] there's a
[2:02:39] positive that positive is there on the
[2:02:42] other side a picture comes out as a
[2:02:46] negative but it's taken of a positive
[2:02:50] hallelujah amen praise God is that's why
[2:02:54] Peter said we have a body reserved in
[2:02:56] the heavens Paul said in verse 15 in
[2:02:59] First Corinthians 15 if this Earthly
[2:03:01] house Tabernacle be dissolved we have
[2:03:04] one in the heavens waiting not made with
[2:03:12] hands live coal and that
[2:03:18] confession and here comes a cleansing in
[2:03:21] his life
[2:03:23] there's no cleansing agent like the
[2:03:28] fire fire
[2:03:32] cleanses let me tell you something
[2:03:34] friends it cleanses so deep it goes into
[2:03:37] where there's
[2:03:38] wounds one time on my foot this may not
[2:03:42] be pretty but it'll
[2:03:43] work don't worry I'm going to take my
[2:03:45] shoes
[2:03:47] off I was running Sprints one day you
[2:03:49] heard the story I was running Sprints
[2:03:51] one day day been running on i' been
[2:03:53] playing been practice the whole day all
[2:03:55] of a sudden I started hobbling in the
[2:03:57] middle of Sprints at the end of Pat
[2:03:58] practice down in Marietta I said Coach
[2:04:01] man I got to sit down I got a rock in my
[2:04:03] shoe I ripped that thing off we made our
[2:04:04] run down there turn it off and then
[2:04:06] quickly tied it back up and got back in
[2:04:08] line and got ready to run man I I made a
[2:04:10] couple steps oh oh something's going on
[2:04:14] got inside the trainers looked at it and
[2:04:15] they looked and they
[2:04:16] said you got a planner warant plannner
[2:04:20] warant
[2:04:21] wow planners w i mean I've been
[2:04:24] practicing on it how long all day and
[2:04:27] that thing didn't come up
[2:04:30] overnight so that white- haired doctor
[2:04:33] you know what he did he told me he said
[2:04:34] he said I tell you what he said Browning
[2:04:37] you meet me tomorrow morning he said in
[2:04:38] our Clinic down here because they taught
[2:04:40] Sports Medicine okay he said we're we
[2:04:42] we'll take care of that okay little did
[2:04:45] I know here he gets a soldering iron out
[2:04:52] this wasn't back in the days of horse
[2:04:53] and buggy either this man I mean he gets
[2:04:56] that thing heated up like what you would
[2:04:58] solder wires together with that's that's
[2:04:59] what it is man he had that thing and I'm
[2:05:01] telling you what it was smoking
[2:05:03] come but you know what he got rid of
[2:05:07] it got rid of it it it hurt a little bit
[2:05:09] for the for the next for the day to walk
[2:05:11] around the next day but you know what
[2:05:12] eventually I was clear I'm saying to you
[2:05:16] this right here there's nothing that'll
[2:05:18] cleanse your life like the fire of God
[2:05:21] Amen
[2:05:22] yes without the fire of God and listen
[2:05:26] friends in order for that coal to really
[2:05:29] come Isaiah could have just enjoyed that
[2:05:32] presence and he would have walked out of
[2:05:34] there with the same that's right same
[2:05:39] feelings
[2:05:41] complaints same habits same life you see
[2:05:46] what makes the difference I thought it's
[2:05:47] just being in the presence of the Lord
[2:05:49] it's recognizing like Isaiah
[2:05:53] whoa I'm undone I'm a man of unclean
[2:05:57] lips there's Lord I I need straightening
[2:06:00] out then cleansing comes once cleansing
[2:06:04] comes then commissioning follows right
[2:06:08] and God says who will go for
[2:06:11] me and he had a confidence to
[2:06:15] say here am I right send me what brought
[2:06:20] the confidence
[2:06:23] confession had opened up it had exposed
[2:06:27] the
[2:06:28] enemy cleansing came and removed all the
[2:06:33] infection it took care of all the
[2:06:35] desires then the
[2:06:37] commissioning the infilling of God's
[2:06:39] presence Hallelujah made him a witness
[2:06:43] right and I tell you this morning no
[2:06:46] matter where you set
[2:06:48] friends you are ordained to be a
[2:06:53] witness and what you want to make sure
[2:06:55] of in your life every one of us is that
[2:06:58] you are a true effective witness we want
[2:07:02] to be the right kind of a witness we
[2:07:04] don't want to be a witness for this
[2:07:06] world we don't want to be a witness for
[2:07:07] our jobs we don't want we want to be a
[2:07:09] witness of Jesus
[2:07:13] Christ we want to be like they talked
[2:07:15] about them Billboards and remember that
[2:07:17] little boy came and got that that
[2:07:19] bartender out of the bar and he said hey
[2:07:20] come out here he said you're signs down
[2:07:23] that bartender walked out there he
[2:07:26] looked up and said what are you talking
[2:07:28] about my signs still on the building no
[2:07:30] no he said I'm talking about your best
[2:07:33] sign best sign that man right there he's
[2:07:37] full of what you're selling on the
[2:07:39] inside he's your best
[2:07:44] advertisement the best advertisement of
[2:07:46] the Gospel of Jesus Christ the best
[2:07:49] advertisement for the message of the is
[2:07:52] to be filled with the Holy
[2:07:55] Ghost to have a confession in your life
[2:07:58] Lord I don't want to go out and keep
[2:08:00] struggling with the same things in my
[2:08:02] life I said under your presence and why
[2:08:05] how sweet your presence is but it's a
[2:08:07] time when God's dealing with you on
[2:08:10] things that's a time to release it
[2:08:12] that's a time to confess it because when
[2:08:14] you confess it then the sarapin will go
[2:08:16] he get puts them in action and they take
[2:08:18] the life cold and they go right and
[2:08:21] they'll touch your lips it'll go down to
[2:08:23] whatever in your heart maybe it's things
[2:08:25] you've been saying things you've been
[2:08:26] looking at things you've been
[2:08:28] entertaining it'll go deeper to where
[2:08:30] it's not just something you say here I
[2:08:32] forgive you but it's something down here
[2:08:35] where real forgiveness resides is in
[2:08:38] your
[2:08:41] heartall and then he can commission you
[2:08:45] as a
[2:08:47] witness I think what an opportunity
[2:08:49] right here this
[2:08:50] morning amen listen I believe this is
[2:08:54] for us this
[2:08:58] morning I told him when I came out I
[2:09:00] said I've got two thoughts in front of
[2:09:02] me that's the reason I didn't send the
[2:09:04] notes CU I don't know which one I'm
[2:09:06] going to speak and this right here
[2:09:09] certain things just came together within
[2:09:12] the last 10 minutes or so before I came
[2:09:18] out God's mindful friends
[2:09:22] I said God's mindful amen we want to be
[2:09:25] sensitive to his
[2:09:27] leadership oh yeah it's things we've
[2:09:30] studied and looked at but as far as
[2:09:31] within it no but God there was something
[2:09:33] else we're looking at but God has so
[2:09:36] zeroed in on it right now you want to
[2:09:37] get somewhere with God it begins first
[2:09:39] of all with confession amen repent all
[2:09:42] right you say brother Samuel I've
[2:09:44] repented now listen if you really repent
[2:09:48] this is what the prophet said if you've
[2:09:50] repented and been baptized in the name
[2:09:52] of Jesus Christ and you haven't received
[2:09:55] the Holy Ghost then you make God a liar
[2:09:59] because he said this is his words he
[2:10:01] cares do you 1963 he because God said in
[2:10:04] his word repent and be baptized in the
[2:10:08] name of Jesus Christ and you shall
[2:10:11] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost I'm
[2:10:15] not talking about speaking in tongues
[2:10:18] that's not the evidence the evidence is
[2:10:20] when he has come to Spirit of Truth John
[2:10:22] 16 John 14 John 15 when he is come he
[2:10:25] will lead and guide you into all
[2:10:28] truth is that right sometime in your
[2:10:30] walk you might speak with tongue but one
[2:10:32] thing for sure the Bible says in Romans
[2:10:34] 8:11 if that Spirit then raised up Jesus
[2:10:37] from the dead dwell in you it will also
[2:10:40] Quicken your mortal body John 14:12 said
[2:10:43] the works that I do shall you do also
[2:10:46] it'll be the same life inside of you
[2:10:50] Messiahs living out Hallelujah in your
[2:10:54] life thank you Lord I say here this
[2:10:57] morning what about it what's holding you
[2:11:01] back what's keeping you back what is
[2:11:03] fear that's comes from the enemy he only
[2:11:06] wants to hold you back it's a
[2:11:08] scarecrow I say cast that aside if you
[2:11:10] can cast that aside there's some good
[2:11:11] butter beans behind there there's a good
[2:11:14] there's a good Holy Ghost back behind
[2:11:15] there there's a good living God behind
[2:11:17] there there's a good living reality
[2:11:19] behind there oh you've tried it so many
[2:11:21] other times I'd say put that aside don't
[2:11:23] let that scarecrow stand in your way say
[2:11:25] God I'm here this morning I see the
[2:11:27] approach it's confession cleansing and
[2:11:31] then commissioning
[2:11:32] amen I'm ready to
[2:11:35] go let's bow our
[2:11:43] heads now friends I'm telling you I
[2:11:45] didn't come out here to preach and
[2:11:47] preach a
[2:11:48] sermon I'm not here to preach a sermon
[2:11:51] I'm not here to see how things can be so
[2:11:53] tied together and how beautiful it can
[2:11:55] be made there's one thing we we're
[2:11:58] Desiring is that Jesus Christ is
[2:12:00] presented before us that our lives are
[2:12:03] touched and affected and influenced by
[2:12:05] him now I'll tell you when it's all said
[2:12:07] and done and his presence has come here
[2:12:11] in this building to Grace us this
[2:12:13] morning and the post of this Temple not
[2:12:15] of this building not of this building
[2:12:17] the Temple that God is leading you
[2:12:20] to is your
[2:12:22] heart because the scripture said know
[2:12:24] you not you are a temple of the Holy
[2:12:27] Ghost just like God wanted to lead
[2:12:30] Isaiah into that place God's wanting to
[2:12:33] lead you into that
[2:12:34] place see he had to bring Isaiah in
[2:12:37] contact with that Temple that was built
[2:12:39] in that time that was a place where they
[2:12:41] could come and meet God God would come
[2:12:43] and meet with them but you see what God
[2:12:46] does there now God wanted to go inside
[2:12:52] live through Isaiah's life
[2:12:55] disappointments hurts wounds yes but
[2:12:58] here's what happened he let all of that
[2:13:01] go in the presence of God there was
[2:13:04] something that was so much more
[2:13:08] valuable than any hurt any
[2:13:11] wound any sin anything of this world he
[2:13:16] found that pearl of great price and he
[2:13:19] was willing to turn loose of everything
[2:13:21] else I'm asking you this morning this
[2:13:24] altar is open I know the altar is in
[2:13:27] your hearts in your mind but I'm not
[2:13:29] pulling on anybody but I want you to
[2:13:31] know it's open but I want to say this to
[2:13:35] you if you're in a place in your
[2:13:39] life and first of all you might look and
[2:13:42] say I'm tired of being an up and down
[2:13:46] life now pardon me for a minute I'm
[2:13:48] going to ask you a question are you
[2:13:49] really tired of it
[2:13:54] or are you at a place to say
[2:13:56] Lord I really
[2:13:59] am I realize I I need I appreciate the
[2:14:02] presence of the Lord
[2:14:05] but I I there's things I in my life it's
[2:14:08] not tallying up when I leave out of here
[2:14:11] my life is still the
[2:14:12] same let me just say this to you because
[2:14:15] we want to expose the enemy
[2:14:17] right that's not God's fault
[2:14:22] but his word comes to lead us to show us
[2:14:25] the right way that we don't have to
[2:14:28] leave out of here the same way and God
[2:14:31] would come by his word and help you and
[2:14:33] I to see it's not just about feeling the
[2:14:36] presence of the Lord that's important we
[2:14:38] this presence should be here he said
[2:14:40] where two or three are gathered together
[2:14:41] in my name I'll be there also but it's
[2:14:43] what we do in his presence if all we do
[2:14:46] is at the end when we come out of it we
[2:14:48] come out with the same things in our
[2:14:50] life maybe there's been things that's
[2:14:52] been built up in your life maybe God has
[2:14:54] done a full work in your life you can
[2:14:56] say hey the things of the world has all
[2:14:58] passed away out of my life my my heart's
[2:15:01] desire is just for the Lord you've
[2:15:04] walked through of repentance you've been
[2:15:07] baptized in the name of Jesus right and
[2:15:08] you have been born again but maybe
[2:15:11] there's things that you have allowed to
[2:15:13] accumulate in your life maybe it's
[2:15:16] frustration with another brother another
[2:15:18] sister maybe it's with spouse maybe it's
[2:15:20] with family maybe it's hurt that's come
[2:15:23] your way maybe you've placed some upon a
[2:15:26] pedestal and realized I should never
[2:15:30] have done that I need to look to God
[2:15:32] because it's the same God for that
[2:15:34] individual for that life that I have to
[2:15:36] I have to have from my own life that
[2:15:38] same Grace remember what judgment you
[2:15:41] meet out will be met back to you so you
[2:15:44] want to make sure you're not meeting out
[2:15:46] judgment you want to be releas in
[2:15:49] Grace but here the
[2:15:52] morning I just I just want to invite you
[2:15:56] in this
[2:15:58] moment a place in his
[2:16:01] presence that you can say I Lord I I
[2:16:04] don't want to continue in the same
[2:16:08] pathway coming to a
[2:16:10] service and then I leave out the same
[2:16:12] way same old things the Lord Brother
[2:16:16] Samuel what is it it's a it's got to be
[2:16:19] a confession friends don't make an
[2:16:21] excuse for anything be a be a con let it
[2:16:24] be a confession a real repentance a real
[2:16:27] cleaning of your
[2:16:28] heart when you can do that before God as
[2:16:32] he would lead you and really that that's
[2:16:33] a way that approach and then will come
[2:16:35] forth a
[2:16:37] cleansing he'll bring the cleansing in
[2:16:39] your
[2:16:41] life then it'll be followed by
[2:16:45] commissioning I tell you the altar is
[2:16:47] open this morning the prince of God is
[2:16:50] here
[2:16:51] to minister to our
[2:16:53] needs I say this to
[2:16:56] you if you feel like you've got cold in
[2:16:59] your walk with God maybe you've
[2:17:02] got like Isaiah or Uzziah was got
[2:17:08] complacent maybe not
[2:17:11] really really caring just kind of
[2:17:13] letting down on your prayer life and
[2:17:15] walk with God and Things become optional
[2:17:20] things just be kind of just your life
[2:17:23] starts to become whole hum and there's
[2:17:25] certain things you start beginning to
[2:17:29] allow in your life that at one time you
[2:17:32] wouldn't have
[2:17:34] allowed this is not you being as far as
[2:17:37] mind over matter but it's recognizing
[2:17:39] the Bible tells us our walk is a walk of
[2:17:43] Holiness separated unto
[2:17:48] God I tell you the prince of God God
[2:17:51] he's here he's here to take desires out
[2:17:53] of your life if you'll stand with the
[2:17:56] word and call wrong what God calls
[2:17:59] wrong I tell you what his presence will
[2:18:01] come it'll change your wardrobe cuz
[2:18:03] it'll change your desire on the
[2:18:06] inside it'll change your life it'll
[2:18:08] change your
[2:18:10] nature his presence will come and give
[2:18:12] you a
[2:18:14] fresh strength a fresh touch if you've
[2:18:19] gotten weary in your walk
[2:18:21] but let's look at it friends let's
[2:18:24] consider it here this morning becoming a
[2:18:27] witness I know a very simple thought
[2:18:29] very simple
[2:18:31] message but there's a reason God would
[2:18:34] do it like
[2:18:36] this hallelujah how many say Lord I
[2:18:39] that's what I want to be I want to be a
[2:18:42] real
[2:18:43] witness I want to be a real
[2:18:45] witness Hallelujah I tell you the
[2:18:48] greatest thing we could do right now is
[2:18:50] to have a moment of
[2:18:52] consecration a real moment of
[2:18:54] consecration many times brother Brandon
[2:18:56] would lead in
[2:18:57] Services before healing Services later
[2:19:00] on the next night would take place it
[2:19:01] would all begin with
[2:19:03] consecration wanting to see God move in
[2:19:06] certain ways see God do things it begins
[2:19:08] with
[2:19:12] consecration I wonder this morning we
[2:19:16] wouldn't be willing to act upon that
[2:19:18] word Lord a fresh
[2:19:21] consecration a
[2:19:24] fresh a fresh
[2:19:26] confession oh brother Samuel repentance
[2:19:29] is so I I did that years ago repentance
[2:19:32] should be something that's daily in your
[2:19:34] life because we fail
[2:19:37] daily Paul said I Die
[2:19:39] daily our sins are taken
[2:19:42] daily before they
[2:19:46] alter oh God help us don't ever let us
[2:19:48] get a get beyond that
[2:19:51] to where we recognize our need from
[2:19:54] him I know you understand what I'm
[2:19:57] saying but it's God giving us a real
[2:19:59] approach in our walk with
[2:20:01] him now I say this not in a matter to
[2:20:04] rebuke you but I say it in a way like
[2:20:06] this that if you're content with where
[2:20:08] you
[2:20:09] are I'm not trying to move anybody but I
[2:20:13] believe I believe you've come here
[2:20:14] because there's a desire you want to get
[2:20:16] closer to God you just didn't come to
[2:20:17] church today to wonder what brother
[2:20:19] Samuel's going to say to today I wonder
[2:20:21] what wonder what's going to be said I
[2:20:22] wonder what songs I I don't believe you
[2:20:24] came here for that you come here because
[2:20:27] there's needs in your life I've got
[2:20:29] needs in my life we've come to have a
[2:20:32] meeting with
[2:20:38] God I'm going to pray for you we're
[2:20:41] going to pray
[2:20:46] together Heavenly Father
[2:20:53] Lord
[2:20:56] God you are so mindful Lord of every
[2:21:00] need in our lives and our hearts
[2:21:03] Lord You're mindful lord of the needs
[2:21:06] Among Us
[2:21:10] Lord now
[2:21:12] Lord throughout this building
[2:21:15] Lord there's nothing Lord that you do by
[2:21:18] chance or coincidence
[2:21:21] we're Believers we know footsteps of the
[2:21:23] righteous are ordered of the
[2:21:25] Lord now
[2:21:28] father I pray that God that right here
[2:21:31] as we have been gathered together in
[2:21:33] your
[2:21:35] presence Lord like Isaiah here we are
[2:21:38] gathered in the presence of the
[2:21:40] Lord it's not so much to come into this
[2:21:43] building right here although it is a
[2:21:44] place you've given us to come and
[2:21:47] gather but father when we come
[2:21:52] together it's come
[2:21:55] Lord in the name of Jesus
[2:21:58] Christ it's to
[2:22:00] meet in that provided place of worship
[2:22:03] that place that gate like you said in
[2:22:06] the book of Deuteronomy where you would
[2:22:08] choose to place your
[2:22:09] name and we know you placed your
[2:22:13] name there in
[2:22:16] Christ and Christ is the word that's who
[2:22:19] you are
[2:22:21] and Lord God we have here in the place
[2:22:24] of meeting this
[2:22:26] morning Lord God no doubt your word Lord
[2:22:28] as it has touched our hearts and moved
[2:22:30] Upon Our Lives to call us
[2:22:34] away from getting our
[2:22:36] attention on
[2:22:38] man or any of man's
[2:22:41] ways but Lord that our attention might
[2:22:44] be rightfully placed on
[2:22:47] you when Isaiah Lord come to that that
[2:22:51] moment this is when he could
[2:22:54] look as long as he was leaning upon
[2:22:57] Uzziah he never had this
[2:23:00] experience but
[2:23:02] once Uzziah had went his
[2:23:06] way church had passed off the
[2:23:09] scene then you called
[2:23:13] Isaiah right in the midst of that Temple
[2:23:15] and he said woe is me for I'm a
[2:23:18] man of unclean lips I'm
[2:23:22] undone Lord you came on the scene and
[2:23:25] you met
[2:23:27] Isaiah in a special
[2:23:29] way but Lord he never would have come to
[2:23:33] a place of hearing the
[2:23:37] word who will go for me you never
[2:23:40] started with that you never started with
[2:23:43] that at all but you showed the right
[2:23:46] approach it's cleansing first
[2:23:50] or that's why you would send a message
[2:23:52] in this
[2:23:54] hour there would not be a message that
[2:23:56] Lord would be in a continuance of man's
[2:23:59] ideas but there had to come a
[2:24:03] cleansing a cleansing a
[2:24:07] separation oh God where the revelation
[2:24:09] of Jesus Christ would break forth in its
[2:24:13] freshness fullness in its power and
[2:24:17] original
[2:24:18] Glory oh Lord God where would be
[2:24:20] revealed when men were tossed about and
[2:24:22] wondering
[2:24:24] Lord is it is it of Jewish blood is it
[2:24:28] how is is it part of that but Lord God
[2:24:30] how that in this hour you would restore
[2:24:33] as the scriptures Lord had said it was
[2:24:36] not the
[2:24:37] blood Jewish
[2:24:40] blood but it was the blood as Peter
[2:24:42] would write of
[2:24:45] Christ God's Own creative blood cell
[2:24:50] because Lord there's no all throughout
[2:24:53] the Earth it was polluted
[2:24:55] blood but it would only be through and
[2:24:58] by Lord you creating a blood
[2:25:02] cell creating a body a temple for
[2:25:05] yourself to come and dwell in
[2:25:07] Lord oh
[2:25:09] Hallelujah Lord God where the blood of
[2:25:12] bulls and goats how precious it was in
[2:25:14] the sense that it would allow man to
[2:25:16] come and still have fellowship with you
[2:25:18] to the degree of what they could have in
[2:25:19] that hour until the fullness of time
[2:25:22] would come but Lord when that time
[2:25:24] arrived then came forth a blood that was
[2:25:26] strong enough to take care of every
[2:25:29] situation Lord to take care of sin to
[2:25:34] take care of
[2:25:36] unbelief and Lord God that you would
[2:25:38] send back your
[2:25:40] spirit upon your
[2:25:43] church that you might continue your work
[2:25:47] through the lives of your redeemed
[2:25:52] subjects now
[2:25:54] Lord you have no hands upon this Earth
[2:25:56] but our hands no feet but our feet you
[2:25:59] are the vine the Life Source we're the
[2:26:03] branches now Lord I pray that God
[2:26:05] throughout this
[2:26:08] building that Lord you would just Lord
[2:26:12] God as we would move Lord into a place
[2:26:16] of
[2:26:18] consecration Lord God if there's things
[2:26:21] Lord that has
[2:26:22] accumulated things Lord that has begin
[2:26:24] to take place precedence in our life not
[2:26:28] sometimes Lord how things happen so
[2:26:31] subtly Lord and you know
[2:26:34] that but you come Lord to show us how
[2:26:38] could we know unless you would show us
[2:26:41] Lord sometimes Lord just one Little Rock
[2:26:44] going in the well it don't seem like
[2:26:45] much and then another rock and then
[2:26:47] another rock and then another rock and
[2:26:49] pretty soon Lord
[2:26:51] we're not able to get the same water out
[2:26:54] of there that we used to
[2:26:57] get I pray
[2:26:59] Lord May Lord here this morning there
[2:27:02] come Lord a fresh
[2:27:04] renewing and refilling Lord God In
[2:27:07] Hearts and
[2:27:08] lives as lives Lord our lives are opened
[2:27:11] up in a fresh consecration to you Lord a
[2:27:14] fresh repentance a fresh confession Lord
[2:27:17] I need you I need you more Lord than I
[2:27:19] need
[2:27:20] my food Lord the bread on my table I
[2:27:23] need you more Lord I need you Lord I
[2:27:27] need your leadership
[2:27:29] Lord more than anything
[2:27:32] Lord oh
[2:27:35] God when things Lord are set in order
[2:27:38] then Lord we can expect things to move
[2:27:40] and to happen
[2:27:42] Lord according to your
[2:27:45] working Lord God I pray granted Lord if
[2:27:49] there's one Lord that
[2:27:51] hasn't come to that place yet Lord maybe
[2:27:53] they enjoy your presence I'm glad they
[2:27:55] do I'm glad they do lord it's a
[2:27:58] wonderful
[2:27:59] thing but Lord Jesus I'm also
[2:28:03] reminded and we must be very careful
[2:28:05] Lord how the rain itself will fall on
[2:28:08] the just and unjust we just don't want
[2:28:10] to be thankful for the rain we want to
[2:28:14] move with what the rain is drawing us
[2:28:18] to Leading us us Lord to a place to be a
[2:28:22] real
[2:28:24] witness
[2:28:26] confession cleansing then a
[2:28:29] commissioning Lord granted I pray Lord
[2:28:32] this Lord broke up little part Lord but
[2:28:37] I'm asking you Lord God Have Your Way
[2:28:41] father Lord I commit the service I
[2:28:44] commit every life commit every heart
[2:28:45] Lord into your hand Lord may you move
[2:28:48] Lord I pray God according to your will
[2:28:50] Lord in each of Our Lives In The Name of
[2:28:53] Jesus
[2:28:55] Christ amen
[2:29:01] amen you know the scripture says in the
[2:29:04] Book of
[2:29:05] Genesis God came in the time of
[2:29:08] Noah and finally God had come to a place
[2:29:10] and he says my spirit will not always
[2:29:12] strive with
[2:29:14] man you know you live in a time and you
[2:29:17] remember
[2:29:20] when you look at things and situations
[2:29:22] that
[2:29:23] happen it's always a moment
[2:29:26] Lord I want to take every
[2:29:28] moment I want to be found ready God
[2:29:32] doesn't come to upset you or to upheave
[2:29:34] you that's not how God works but God
[2:29:35] comes to draw Upon Our Lives friends we
[2:29:38] want to be
[2:29:40] ready we want to be ready we want to
[2:29:42] move when the spirit of God just like as
[2:29:44] God was dealing with Israel remember
[2:29:46] Israel came to a spot when God was
[2:29:48] dealing with them and God there was even
[2:29:51] evidence brought back from the land that
[2:29:53] it was a good land and the 10 spies they
[2:29:57] chose to look beyond that evidence you
[2:30:01] know what that evidence was it was that
[2:30:03] God keeps his word what God Said but
[2:30:07] they chose to look at all of what they
[2:30:11] called Giants and there weren't Giants
[2:30:13] they looked at all their problems they
[2:30:15] looked at all this they looked at all
[2:30:16] the ups and downs but God had an
[2:30:19] Evidence and let me tell you the
[2:30:21] evidence the evidence that this is a
[2:30:23] good land is the Holy Ghost it's a
[2:30:26] presence of God that is greater than
[2:30:29] every excuse that's greater than every
[2:30:31] shortcoming it's greater than all your
[2:30:33] failures it's greater than all your
[2:30:34] mistakes take your eyes off of you and
[2:30:37] off of all the other Giants and look at
[2:30:40] the
[2:30:41] evidence it's greater the evidence says
[2:30:44] God is with us the evidence says God
[2:30:47] keeps his word amen you know if they
[2:30:49] would have received the evidence in the
[2:30:51] right way they would have had a worship
[2:30:53] service instead of a funeral
[2:30:56] service they would have had a worship
[2:30:59] service in the camp that night say
[2:31:01] brother Samuel is that is that
[2:31:03] scriptural sure the disciples went up to
[2:31:06] the upper room the Bible says full of
[2:31:09] joy rejoicing cuz they knew the promise
[2:31:12] was sure when God makes something known
[2:31:15] to you it's sure act on it act on it act
[2:31:19] on it
[2:31:21] you love him amen let's be obedient to
[2:31:25] God let's be obedient to the Lord let
[2:31:28] the spirit of God let him move don't I
[2:31:30] know it might be like even with time and
[2:31:32] things but listen friends let me tell
[2:31:34] you something what's eternity compared
[2:31:37] to a few
[2:31:39] moments really what's eternity compared
[2:31:41] to a few
[2:31:42] moments I'm not saying that the whole
[2:31:44] I'm saying that from the reality of is
[2:31:46] that what is eternity for just a few
[2:31:49] moments
[2:31:51] to be sure where our life is at with
[2:31:56] God you love him am amen if you'd like
[2:32:00] to stand go ahead
[2:32:20] opening and was me opening for
[2:32:24] you
[2:32:28] you you been
[2:32:32] hiding I open the
[2:32:36] door look
[2:32:39] out it is
[2:32:42] me it said to
[2:32:46] you will you want to come out
[2:32:50] to stay
[2:32:54] in I'm sh
[2:32:59] you I'll give you my
[2:33:05] hand
[2:33:10] it
[2:33:13] it it is I I will guide
[2:33:18] you I will
[2:33:37] you know the scriptures might be new
[2:33:38] here the scriptures tells us when they
[2:33:42] were going to battle it's in the New
[2:33:44] Testament in the old they didn't know
[2:33:46] how to approach the
[2:33:48] battle but then it said one of them of
[2:33:51] the Levites one that was within that
[2:33:53] part begin to of the singers stood up
[2:33:56] and they begin to
[2:33:59] prophesy now remember God can call out
[2:34:02] very specific is that right the prophet
[2:34:05] tells us with things this was wrong in
[2:34:08] your life go make this right and this
[2:34:09] right you took from somebody in a
[2:34:12] garbage truck and this and that but also
[2:34:15] when God speaks the prophet also tells
[2:34:18] us
[2:34:20] that individual will
[2:34:22] know whom God has speaking to in their
[2:34:25] life is that right sometimes we hear it
[2:34:28] where it'll begin with tongues right
[2:34:31] then it'll come into interpretation and
[2:34:34] that interpretation is
[2:34:36] prophecy but within it all where it
[2:34:39] comes down to is
[2:34:42] that God
[2:34:44] himself he's in our midst and he's
[2:34:46] speaking he has already spoken
[2:34:50] we want to act upon the word of God
[2:34:52] that's the greatest compliment that we
[2:34:54] can do is to act upon the word of God
[2:34:58] amen hallelujah

[2:35:15] call who will go and work for for me
