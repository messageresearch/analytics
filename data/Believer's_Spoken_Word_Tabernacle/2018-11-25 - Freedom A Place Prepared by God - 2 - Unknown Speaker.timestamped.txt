[38:46] have god bless you
[38:47] it's good to have you here with us and
[38:49] we want to turn right in the scriptures
[38:51] to revelations chapter 12 verse 1 is
[39:01] what I'd like to just read a few verses
[39:03] of Scripture this morning
[39:13] there appeared a great wonder in heaven
[39:15] a woman clothed with the Sun and the
[39:18] moon under her feet and upon her head a
[39:21] crown of twelve stars and she being with
[39:24] child cried travailing in birth and
[39:27] pained to be delivered and there
[39:30] appeared another wonder in heaven and
[39:32] behold a great red dragon having seven
[39:35] heads and ten horns and seven Crown's
[39:38] upon his heads and his tail drew the
[39:42] third part of the stars of heaven and
[39:44] did cast them to the earth and the
[39:47] dragon stood before the woman which was
[39:49] ready to be delivered for to devour her
[39:52] child as soon as it was born and she
[39:55] brought forth a man child who was to
[39:58] rule all nations with a rod of iron and
[40:01] her child was caught up unto God and to
[40:05] his throne and the woman fled into the
[40:08] wilderness where she hath a place
[40:10] prepared of God that they should feed
[40:12] her there a thousand two hundred and
[40:16] threescore days may God bless you bless
[40:20] the reading of his word as you're being
[40:21] seated I'd like to continue to look at
[40:26] that font here just a little on freedom
[40:31] it's a place prepared of God this verse
[40:37] of scriptures that we've read we know it
[40:39] continues to transition back and forth
[40:42] between that of the Jewish church that
[40:47] of the Gentile church and then coming
[40:51] back to the calling out of the 144,000
[40:57] but I want to focus on verse 6 a little
[41:00] bit more here this morning and we know
[41:03] that when we look at this this verse
[41:07] brother Branham was very clear as the
[41:09] Spirit of God would direct and give the
[41:13] direction that this verse it speaks of
[41:16] the very purpose of this land that we
[41:20] would call America of why that it was
[41:24] founded was for the purpose of freedom
[41:27] of
[41:28] religion there was no other it wasn't
[41:31] any other any other purpose other than
[41:34] that freedom of religion and we see of
[41:37] that you know as we looked at it last
[41:39] week where brother Branham told us that
[41:41] when we come together on this holiday
[41:43] the Thanksgiving holiday said this is an
[41:46] American holiday and it's one that where
[41:49] God has had given a desire within the
[41:53] hearts of people that they would escape
[41:56] that the tyranny and the rule of that
[41:59] Roman Catholic system that had continued
[42:03] to move and follow the very movement of
[42:06] God you see every time that God would
[42:09] make a move
[42:10] guys God would move eventually you find
[42:13] that that system would move in behind it
[42:15] and it kept moving until where we are at
[42:18] in this place the gospel itself it can't
[42:21] go any further than back east again but
[42:24] to look at the purpose within this this
[42:26] scripture here I want you to I want to
[42:29] draw your attention here there was a
[42:31] period of time and it's a place that was
[42:34] prepared of God whereby to be fed and to
[42:37] be nourished by the word and the spirit
[42:40] to be built up the whole purpose was so
[42:43] that God knowing that what God had
[42:46] intended that God is calling a people
[42:50] out of the Gentiles for his namesake God
[42:52] had been had been already doing that and
[42:55] all of that was moving he was building
[42:58] his body all along and in this place
[43:00] that you know as we look at and now we
[43:03] see my the expanse of civilization and
[43:06] where things are at now but yet it was a
[43:08] place of wilderness there was not places
[43:12] of development but yet it was given as a
[43:14] place that God whereby that God would be
[43:18] able to feed his people be able to
[43:20] nourish his people by his word and by
[43:23] his Spirit and when you look at it you
[43:25] know we think of it that even within
[43:27] this we see that how much that the
[43:30] purpose itself was so far lost it's not
[43:32] even it's not even held in the original
[43:35] content of why that this place that you
[43:38] and I here we call home of
[43:41] I was even founded in the first place
[43:43] the purpose itself has so far left from
[43:46] the hearts of the people and I believe
[43:49] that that's something that we can see
[43:51] and look at how that God provided this
[43:53] land for a place to be nourished and fed
[43:56] and I believe that if we look at how
[43:58] that God has provided for us in this
[44:01] hour a place that we can be nourished
[44:04] and fed where God would open his word to
[44:07] us his spirit to us that we can come
[44:09] into a place coming into the body of
[44:12] Jesus Christ into the word that God has
[44:14] promised in this hour I believe that it
[44:17] is so beneficial and crucial to us that
[44:20] we are mindful there is a purpose of why
[44:23] God has done what he has done God did
[44:26] not do what he has done in this hour so
[44:28] that we would become puffed up but we
[44:31] recognized that if not for the grace of
[44:33] God we would be just like any others and
[44:36] to think of it that why is it that there
[44:39] would even be a desire within our hearts
[44:42] like the scripture said the woman fled
[44:44] not everybody fled not everybody came
[44:46] here but there were those that we look
[44:49] at and call the pilgrims and how many of
[44:51] them started out there in that time 105
[44:54] I believe it is and here you end up with
[44:56] 66 or something to that to that nature
[44:58] what is it that would be within them
[45:01] that would drive them to make such a
[45:03] sacrifice and avoid or even those that
[45:07] would follow after what is that I'll
[45:09] tell you what that is that was the
[45:11] Spirit of God moving within them that
[45:14] there was a call and God was in the
[45:17] midst of bringing this word to pass and
[45:20] even though that they within themselves
[45:22] would not have the understanding I'm
[45:24] doing this because of this but you see
[45:26] when God gets ready to fulfill his word
[45:29] God puts it within the heart and the
[45:32] condition of the heart will match what
[45:34] God's heart was when he spoke it there
[45:37] and here they were moving within this to
[45:39] come to a place where they could worship
[45:41] God freely where where the Spirit of God
[45:44] could take that word and nourish their
[45:47] lives and build them up that was the
[45:50] purpose and the reason that they land to
[45:52] here and I look at this and I
[45:55] of all that it would behoove us in this
[45:57] hour to recognize the grace of God that
[46:00] has come to us and opened to us this
[46:03] land in this hour I believe it's
[46:05] imperative that we don't take these
[46:08] things for granted but we be very
[46:10] diligent with what God is open to us
[46:13] that it ought to be something that
[46:15] raises in our hearts that says Lord I
[46:17] want to occupy every bit of it it ought
[46:20] to be something that feels our heart and
[46:23] it drives us and it motivates as I I'm
[46:25] not talking about and being motivated by
[46:27] a pastor that will wear out I'm not
[46:30] talking about being motivated by a
[46:31] church you've got to have this in your
[46:34] own heart where you desire this you know
[46:40] the Bible tells us like this that here
[46:43] in Psalms 33 verse 12 blessed is the
[46:46] nation whose God is the Lord at one time
[46:52] America could say that but America can
[46:56] no longer say this we know that you know
[47:00] many times that it said she's a
[47:02] Christian nation but the Prophet already
[47:04] identified by what was done he said we
[47:07] are not a Christian nation we are a
[47:10] Catholic nation so this has already been
[47:14] done and you know to think of this bless
[47:17] it is that nation what was the great
[47:19] blessing about this nation what is the
[47:22] blessing about it the blessing was that
[47:24] God was the Lord think about it brother
[47:27] man tells us he said they would have
[47:29] never had to have bomb shelters and all
[47:31] these other things they would have never
[47:33] had to think about that Israel never had
[47:36] to start thinking about all these
[47:38] enemies when their focus was on God they
[47:41] didn't even have to focus upon their
[47:43] crops they only had to focus upon the
[47:46] Lord and everything that they did the
[47:49] sowing of their crops the rain would be
[47:51] there in its due season all they had to
[47:53] do was make the Lord their refuge
[47:57] no wonder the scripture says blessed is
[48:00] the nation whose God is the Lord and the
[48:05] people in whom he had chosen for his own
[48:07] in here
[48:07] now notice this parallel brother Brown
[48:09] will run this parallel here between the
[48:12] nation of Israel and our nation think of
[48:14] this here in Deuteronomy 4:20 the Lord
[48:17] hath taken you and brought you forth out
[48:21] of the iron furnace even out of Egypt to
[48:25] be unto him a people of inheritance as
[48:28] ye are this day I believe with all my
[48:32] heart when we recognize why God himself
[48:36] would open his word would make himself
[48:38] real and alive to our hearts to
[48:41] recognize it's God that has taken us out
[48:44] of the air iron furnace that we would be
[48:47] a people of inheritance unto Him the
[48:51] Bible goes on to say in 2nd Corinthians
[48:53] 3:17 that the Lord is that spirit and
[48:56] where the Spirit of the Lord is there is
[48:59] Liberty you know freedom is not free I I
[49:03] know we've got different veterans
[49:05] sitting here right now that we thank God
[49:07] for their service our freedom was not
[49:10] free and I'll tell you freedom itself if
[49:13] freedom is not something that's just
[49:15] handed to somebody freedom itself is
[49:18] what is taken and it must be maintained
[49:21] there must be a desire within the heart
[49:25] to remain free to remain the skate to
[49:28] remain liberated there must be a
[49:31] pulsation and a desire because you see
[49:34] well there is a false Liberty and that
[49:38] false Liberty is the same it has within
[49:42] it the same interpreter that came to Eve
[49:45] and told Eve that if you just eat of
[49:49] this tree you will be as God's and he
[49:52] was presenting to her a gospel that
[49:56] within it that if you go this way God
[49:59] surely will not kill you he's taking
[50:01] away the penalty you know what he's
[50:03] doing he's destroying the effectiveness
[50:06] and the authority of God's Word if I
[50:09] can't believe that God will stand behind
[50:11] one word what makes you think I'm gonna
[50:14] have faith for any other word you see
[50:16] Satan does is to try to undermine the
[50:20] authority and divine inspiration that is
[50:23] given by God upon the world freedom
[50:27] isn't free there is a Liberty that is a
[50:36] true freedom
[50:37] it's a place it is the person of Jesus
[50:41] Christ hallelujah there is what what is
[50:45] said today I am free and oh you know
[50:49] I've got Liberty but in reality it's
[50:52] bondage I think to think of this you and
[50:56] I this morning if your soul has been set
[51:00] free by the Holy Ghost you know realized
[51:04] within your life in my life this morning
[51:06] the desire of God has come forth in
[51:09] afro-eurasian do you realize that there
[51:12] are drunks and prostitutes and
[51:14] everywhere else that know those desires
[51:17] would be there but you'll find him and
[51:19] they'll say I don't want to be this way
[51:21] now here it comes again this weekend
[51:23] they are enslaved to those desires that
[51:26] they want to be free of but to think of
[51:28] it for you and I it's easier when you've
[51:31] been born of the Spirit of God by the
[51:33] true Liberty it's easier to live a
[51:36] Christian life than it is a drunk to be
[51:38] a drunk it's easier because you do what
[51:43] you want to do you see when God has
[51:48] separated us from the world you know and
[51:51] you look all the way down through this
[51:52] road the road down through here
[51:54] you got the Greek Orthodox brother and
[51:56] you got the badness on up the road and
[51:58] he you have all these different places
[51:59] that are that are down through here each
[52:02] one of the churches themselves are
[52:04] separated and they're separated based on
[52:06] their doctrines or their what they
[52:09] believe out of the scripture but that is
[52:11] not what God calls separation that is
[52:13] called organization but the real
[52:16] separation of God is not by us just
[52:19] having a different take on the word or
[52:22] us just preaching a different a
[52:23] different word that's not what it is
[52:26] it is the very presence of Almighty God
[52:29] that made
[52:30] the difference remember when Moses said
[52:32] Lord if you don't go on don't take us up
[52:35] any further for how shall it be known
[52:37] that we are thy people is it not in that
[52:41] thy presence will go with us you see the
[52:44] presence of the Lord brings liberty to
[52:48] life it will expose the error of the
[52:51] spirit of error and will leads you to
[52:53] righteousness
[52:54] it'll leads you to domina settled leads
[52:57] you to holiness he leads you to a true
[52:59] Liberty the presence of God will
[53:02] manifest and reveal his name to be the
[53:05] same yesterday today and forever
[53:09] glory churches churches can be separated
[53:14] but remember our separation is not
[53:16] because we come here it's not because
[53:19] that weari quotes that is not that could
[53:22] just be we're no different than any
[53:24] other church but the difference is the
[53:27] presence of the Lord and remember where
[53:31] the Spirit of the Lord is various
[53:34] Liberty
[53:36] but remember let us not take Liberty for
[53:41] granted Liberty is not always a
[53:45] guarantee as this nation right here
[53:49] remember it was a period of time there
[53:53] were those who made in the provision in
[53:56] a period of time and even you and I
[53:58] after in the midst of all this
[54:00] corruption yet you and I as we see all
[54:03] of this sinking and caving in all around
[54:05] us but yet God has provided a place for
[54:08] you and I in Christ where we can be
[54:11] nourished and fed and built up and being
[54:13] made ready for the coming of the Lord
[54:16] but yet within it this place itself this
[54:19] building who knows if God carries
[54:21] remember the prophet said one day they
[54:23] will shut us up who knows one day this
[54:26] very building right here it may no
[54:29] longer be used as a building for
[54:31] whatever it might come but let me bring
[54:33] it on down here close who knows is there
[54:35] a guarantee that this building itself
[54:38] well it's always going to be a church is
[54:40] that oh is that the guarantee
[54:42] there's no guarantee about this but as
[54:44] long as the hearts of the people that
[54:48] assemble here under the word is in tune
[54:51] and one with God it will be a place that
[54:54] God Himself will feel welcome to come
[54:57] down and move among his people he feels
[55:00] welcome to come among his people where
[55:03] hearts hearts are aligned with what he
[55:07] thought when he spoke his word now
[55:11] remember in God there is no sin
[55:13] there's no variableness there's no
[55:16] shadow of turning he's perfect is that
[55:20] right and God's desire is to dwell among
[55:23] us
[55:24] that's his desire but remember it's not
[55:27] something that is guaranteed it's a
[55:30] place we must create well how do I
[55:34] create that by our heart our life the
[55:38] way we live this is where true Liberty
[55:45] itself has boundaries you know the sea
[55:50] can only go so far you see God when God
[55:54] even would set even the boundaries God
[55:56] was speaking of child-raising there's
[55:59] got to be boundaries and boundaries are
[56:02] known they are set forth for what reason
[56:06] boundaries are security there are
[56:09] borders that are given by God God gave
[56:12] the parameters sure of Israel as a land
[56:15] but he gave them the borders of
[56:17] protection was his name his word his
[56:23] life and no wonder Paul could admonish
[56:26] the Galatian Church what's how deceptive
[56:29] it had come in Paul could tell them
[56:31] stand fast and therefore in the Liberty
[56:35] wherewith Christ hath made us free and
[56:39] be not entangled again with the yoke of
[56:42] bondage notice Stan Stan be persistent
[56:45] be perseverant keep ones standing now
[56:51] let's look here just a little bit as
[56:53] we're looking at this parallel and let's
[56:54] take just of
[56:55] jurnee this morning if the Lord would
[56:57] help us and let's look here into this
[57:00] parallel of Israel here is Israel
[57:02] they've come up out of the land of Egypt
[57:04] that come through the time of judges
[57:06] wherever men did what was right in his
[57:08] own eyes and then Israel began to get
[57:10] their eyes on other nations which God
[57:12] said they would and they desired to have
[57:14] a king and then they raised up and made
[57:16] a king after their heart not after God's
[57:19] heart it was one that they chose
[57:22] according to their choosing not gods
[57:23] choosing but God permitted them and
[57:27] allowed them to do it then we watch how
[57:29] that God will take a permissive will but
[57:31] yet it will only it will come back to a
[57:33] place God will bring it around to where
[57:35] that he'll be able to set forth his
[57:37] perfect will now notice this has Solomon
[57:40] himself David is praying in the midst of
[57:43] this in 1st chronicles 28 for howbeit
[57:46] the Lord God of Israel chose me before
[57:49] all the house of my father to be king
[57:51] over Israel for ever for he had chosen
[57:54] Judah to be the ruler and of the house
[57:56] of Judah the house of my father and
[57:58] among the sons of my father he liked me
[58:01] to make me king over all Israel and all
[58:04] of my sons for the Lord had given me
[58:06] many sons he had chosen Solomon my son
[58:10] to sit upon the throne of the Kingdom of
[58:12] the Lord over Israel and he sent unto me
[58:15] Solomon thy son he shall build my house
[58:18] and my courts for I had chosen him to be
[58:21] my son and I will be his father you know
[58:23] the choosing of God is a very wonderful
[58:25] thing it's a wonderful thing but the
[58:28] choosing of God cannot be taken for
[58:30] granted just because that we are his
[58:32] children does not mean he won't correct
[58:34] us he's a faithful father remember God
[58:37] never visits a generation and reveals
[58:40] himself
[58:41] I am the grandfather now every time God
[58:44] makes himself known I am the God of thy
[58:47] father Abraham God always reveals
[58:51] himself as the father to his seed line
[58:55] so to think the choosing of God is a
[58:58] very wonderful thing it's wonderful to
[58:59] know the choosing of God this is why
[59:01] that the Paul would say no your election
[59:04] brother Peter would say make your
[59:06] calling an election
[59:07] sure you make the calling you make it
[59:10] sure nobody else can do that but you now
[59:13] watch this moreover I will establish his
[59:16] kingdom forever if he be constant to do
[59:19] my Commandments and my judgments at
[59:22] theirs at this day now therefore in the
[59:25] sight of all Israel the congregation of
[59:27] the Lord and in the audience of our God
[59:29] keep and seek for all the commandments
[59:33] of the Lord your God
[59:35] notice keep and seek
[59:39] keep and seek not just where it's handed
[59:43] but remember Liberty is not free keep
[59:47] and seek for all the commandments of the
[59:49] Lord your God that ye may possess this
[59:52] good land and leave it for an
[59:53] inheritance for your children after you
[59:55] forever and thou solomon my son know
[59:58] that the god of thy father know Val the
[1:00:02] God of thy father and serve him with a
[1:00:05] perfect heart and with a willing mind
[1:00:08] notice how David instructs Solomon this
[1:00:12] is David telling him this is how that
[1:00:14] you served the Lord with a perfect
[1:00:16] perfect meaning complete heart God wants
[1:00:22] completeness and a willing mind a
[1:00:28] willing mind that which one takes
[1:00:30] pleasure in which it is the delight of
[1:00:34] the individual sews David is admonishing
[1:00:37] solomon let it be that from thy life
[1:00:40] that there is a completeness of your
[1:00:43] heart that is given to god as well as a
[1:00:45] desire within to please him for the lord
[1:00:51] searches all hearts aren't you glad for
[1:00:53] that and understandeth all the
[1:00:55] imaginations of the heart I'm glad for
[1:00:57] that too I'm glad for a beliving word
[1:00:59] that comes down and discerns the very
[1:01:02] intentions intents of the heart
[1:01:06] I'm glad when there's decisions or
[1:01:09] there's things that can be going on
[1:01:11] within our life and you know we might
[1:01:13] not be something where we are able to
[1:01:15] open the scriptures and find maybe the
[1:01:18] answer written there in black and white
[1:01:20] but
[1:01:20] holy spirit oh my he doesn't need a new
[1:01:23] word but the Spirit of God is able to
[1:01:25] come down and with the word that he's
[1:01:27] given manifest his characteristic his
[1:01:30] nature in that hour and it'll speak
[1:01:32] right to your heart right to your need
[1:01:34] and yet you look at it and say ma that's
[1:01:37] alarm oh how did that happen because God
[1:01:39] knows our need and God will discern and
[1:01:43] speak to our hearts how many times where
[1:01:45] there's been people that's ready to make
[1:01:47] a decision and they brought that
[1:01:49] decision carrying it on their heart
[1:01:50] they've been in prayer with it and they
[1:01:52] come to the house of God and right here
[1:01:55] God comes down and he speaks to that
[1:01:57] knee and he answers that question and
[1:02:00] right quickly either they say yes I'm
[1:02:02] going to go ahead God has led me to do
[1:02:04] it or they say no I'm not going to do it
[1:02:06] because God has warned me against it
[1:02:10] hello
[1:02:13] because God's desire he leads us and he
[1:02:17] knows our hearts this is what this is a
[1:02:21] very important place of instruction if
[1:02:24] thou seek him he will be found of thee
[1:02:28] but if thou forsake him he will cast the
[1:02:32] off forever take heed now for the Lord
[1:02:35] had chosen thee to build a house for the
[1:02:39] sanctuary
[1:02:40] be strong and do it you see these were
[1:02:45] men David and Solomon right here that
[1:02:49] knew what godly fear was this is a time
[1:02:53] and an age where when we stand right now
[1:02:56] there is no fear and yet that no fear it
[1:03:00] really is fear you don't understand you
[1:03:03] see the bumper stickers no fear that's a
[1:03:05] lie the Bible says that the fear of the
[1:03:09] Lord is the beginning of wisdom but in
[1:03:12] this age people are so taken with things
[1:03:15] they may not take sedatives they may not
[1:03:17] take all these other pills but
[1:03:18] everything else that they will take in
[1:03:21] to their life to try to keep their so
[1:03:24] deadened to the reality there's a
[1:03:26] judgment coming
[1:03:28] they'll do everything in the world to
[1:03:31] try to Det then silence that voice I'll
[1:03:33] tell you what if that voice within you
[1:03:35] is calling out for life it's because
[1:03:37] there is a source of life there is a
[1:03:40] place where you can have a real true
[1:03:42] life and liberty and actually be free
[1:03:48] take heed be attentive be careful be
[1:03:52] diligent be strong think of this here in
[1:04:00] the scriptures as we go along in second
[1:04:03] chronicles verse in chapter 6 verse 4
[1:04:06] here is David or Solomon rather and he
[1:04:10] recognizes this choosing of how that God
[1:04:12] has chosen to place his name here in
[1:04:16] that which God is directed to be built
[1:04:20] notice in verse 7 now was in the heart
[1:04:22] of David my father to build a house for
[1:04:25] the name of the Lord God of Israel
[1:04:27] notice it was in the heart of David you
[1:04:31] remember when God revealed it to David
[1:04:32] David said praise God and then God held
[1:04:35] back said but David you're not going to
[1:04:37] be the one to do it what did David say I
[1:04:39] love this in the scripture it was not a
[1:04:41] selfishness in his heart at all he said
[1:04:44] then I will pray for what you've
[1:04:46] revealed see what God has revealed it
[1:04:50] didn't matter if David was the one to
[1:04:52] make it to happen you see then what was
[1:04:54] it the heart of Christ that was there in
[1:04:58] David I will pray for this to happen
[1:05:02] now it was in the heart of David my
[1:05:04] father to build a house for the name of
[1:05:06] the Lord God of Israel but the Lord said
[1:05:08] to David my father for as much as it was
[1:05:12] in thine heart to build a house for my
[1:05:14] name thou did us well in that it was in
[1:05:19] thine heart
[1:05:22] God so honored that it rested in David's
[1:05:28] heart to build a house there was not lip
[1:05:33] service that David gave God it was his
[1:05:36] heart
[1:05:37] David expended his life laying up so
[1:05:42] that this place could be built David
[1:05:46] gave of himself why because the word was
[1:05:50] revealed to David it was in David's
[1:05:53] heart
[1:05:53] do you realize David why are you
[1:05:55] exerting yourself David why are you
[1:05:57] glowing the way you're glowing why are
[1:05:58] you doing it it was in his heart don't
[1:06:00] you realize friends that when God
[1:06:02] anytime that the love of God has entered
[1:06:05] into the heart of the believer
[1:06:07] you don't live the way you live because
[1:06:09] you're afraid of Hell you live the way
[1:06:12] you live because you love the Lord the
[1:06:16] love of God is in your heart the desire
[1:06:18] to please him if it's just in this
[1:06:22] church
[1:06:23] you'll fall under conviction and if you
[1:06:25] don't get your heart really set right
[1:06:27] it'll line right back up in your life
[1:06:29] and preaching I have two coming in but
[1:06:31] you ever get that heart set just right
[1:06:33] with God and the love of God enters
[1:06:35] they're brother and sister there ain't
[1:06:36] enough devils and demons out of torment
[1:06:38] that can ever take that out of your
[1:06:40] heart because you have become one with
[1:06:43] the purpose and program of Almighty God
[1:06:45] your heart is in it you ever heard
[1:06:48] somebody say your heart's not in it
[1:06:52] who was it was it Paul Rader you know he
[1:06:54] kissed his wife and ran out the door
[1:06:57] he got to thinking what happened to her
[1:06:59] if I'm going he ran back in and grabbed
[1:07:01] her and laid one on her what's the
[1:07:03] difference the second one had feeling in
[1:07:05] it I believe that sound were to serve
[1:07:09] God with feeling with heart now don't
[1:07:14] misunderstand me I believe in emotions
[1:07:15] I'm not just talking money motion I'm
[1:07:17] talking about with our heart when you
[1:07:20] serve God with your heart he doesn't
[1:07:22] matter where you're at you can be in a
[1:07:24] factory you can be in a grocery store
[1:07:25] you can be anywhere and your heart is
[1:07:28] still sealed away with God
[1:07:32] he is the delight of your life
[1:07:35] oh my notwithstanding oh my he let David
[1:07:41] know he shall not build the house of the
[1:07:42] Lord but the Sun which shall come forth
[1:07:44] out of thy loins he shall build the
[1:07:46] house for my name notice the Sun that
[1:07:48] would come forth from the loins of David
[1:07:51] would be the one who would build the
[1:07:53] house of the Lord here is the great type
[1:07:56] of here out of God notice out of God
[1:07:59] here coming forth the word the son how
[1:08:01] that God Himself would actually erect
[1:08:04] his dwelling place through and by the
[1:08:06] surrendering and submission of the life
[1:08:09] of his only begotten son that God
[1:08:12] himself through and by this this
[1:08:15] offering that was paid that then the
[1:08:17] Holy Spirit being released the water in
[1:08:19] the blood to be able to call us to
[1:08:21] himself to where that he then could come
[1:08:24] and live on the inside it is all a work
[1:08:27] of almighty Glahn notice what David says
[1:08:30] right here in verse 10 the Lord
[1:08:32] therefore hath performed his word that
[1:08:35] he has spoken who performed it the Lord
[1:08:38] but how did the Lord performance by
[1:08:41] hearts being surrendered to him God said
[1:08:44] after your energy or my energy but he's
[1:08:47] after our energies being surrendered
[1:08:50] through a heart for I am risen up I am
[1:08:56] risen up this was the rising of the Sun
[1:08:59] come on somebody this was the
[1:09:01] resurrection before I am risen up in the
[1:09:04] room of David my father and him sat on
[1:09:06] the throne of Israel as the Lord
[1:09:08] promised and have built the house for
[1:09:10] the name of the Lord God of Israel and
[1:09:13] in it have I put the ark wherein is the
[1:09:16] Covenant of the Lord that he made with
[1:09:19] the children of Israel notice I have put
[1:09:22] the ark in it when God builds a house he
[1:09:26] builds it by his word he has solid
[1:09:29] foundations right and he been he himself
[1:09:33] the finishing touch is when he places
[1:09:37] himself in it
[1:09:39] that itself becomes a perfect dwelling
[1:09:43] place of the Lord God oh mama
[1:09:47] so risen and he assembled the material
[1:09:49] for a dwelling place now notice if we go
[1:09:53] on in first Kings chapter 9 verse 1 now
[1:09:56] what Solomon here I want you to watch
[1:09:58] the order in the scripture here the
[1:10:00] Bible said when it came to pass when
[1:10:03] Solomon had finished the building of the
[1:10:05] house of the Lord and the Kings house
[1:10:07] and all Solomon's desire which he was
[1:10:12] pleased to do notice the order he
[1:10:15] finished the house of the Lord and his
[1:10:19] house it wasn't his house first and the
[1:10:23] Lord's house second come on somebody you
[1:10:26] see it was God's house first you can't
[1:10:29] build your house by putting your house
[1:10:31] first god's house is first the house of
[1:10:36] the lord is first your life is first
[1:10:38] your life unto god you might give
[1:10:41] yourself into all sorts of other things
[1:10:43] but yet if your heart and everything
[1:10:46] within you is not fully given to the
[1:10:49] lord first it'll never come out right
[1:10:52] it'll never come out right God can never
[1:10:54] bless that and if God does bless it look
[1:10:57] out a person begins to think God's with
[1:11:00] me he's blessing me I'll tell you
[1:11:03] friends when the presence of god when
[1:11:04] god's prison ever pulls back from you
[1:11:07] it's something within your heart that
[1:11:08] you begin to seek after if there's
[1:11:10] something you've prayed or hear you've
[1:11:12] been reading or whatever more for
[1:11:14] something you start searching your life
[1:11:16] there's things you start looking at
[1:11:17] saying the lord is there something that
[1:11:19] i'm entertained
[1:11:20] is there something Lord that I'm
[1:11:21] dwelling on and what what is it Lord is
[1:11:23] it
[1:11:23] forgive me Lord is there anything and
[1:11:25] yet you begin to come to times as a
[1:11:27] mature believer you recognize there are
[1:11:29] dry times to make us appreciate the
[1:11:32] times of refreshing but it does not
[1:11:34] maturity does not cause us to get loose
[1:11:37] it does not cause us to come into a
[1:11:39] place to say well you know I'm the
[1:11:41] chosen one I'm the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:11:43] that's a contrary attitude to that a
[1:11:45] maturity real maturity rec
[1:11:48] Nasus and brings us to the realization
[1:11:50] that we need him all the time think
[1:11:53] about it
[1:11:53] toddlers they know they need help to
[1:11:55] walk they know they need help to get
[1:11:57] their milk bottle they know this but
[1:11:59] once then it grows up to teenagers
[1:12:00] teenagers are telling you they're the
[1:12:02] ones who invented the car they know how
[1:12:04] it runs they know all of this you never
[1:12:06] knew anything you were never my age you
[1:12:08] don't know what I'm talking about but
[1:12:10] once they get beyond that teenager spot
[1:12:12] then they get into a place to recognize
[1:12:14] you know what mom and dad weren't dumb
[1:12:16] after all they were pretty smart they
[1:12:18] begin to evaluate the word that's been
[1:12:22] given to them and I believe with all of
[1:12:24] my heart that even within the spiritual
[1:12:26] birth we have those stages and real true
[1:12:29] maturity does not make a self-reliant or
[1:12:32] self dependent but it makes us more
[1:12:34] dependent upon the Holy Ghost to
[1:12:37] recognize that he is the one that has
[1:12:40] been leading us and directing us the
[1:12:43] whole time he's the one that we are
[1:12:45] resting it and counting on to take us on
[1:12:49] Omaha so here the order the order was
[1:12:52] absolutely in the right order that's
[1:12:55] a--that's a good thing in the house of
[1:12:57] God is first his life is first and I'm
[1:13:00] not just I'm not just talking about this
[1:13:01] I believe this to be a place that God
[1:13:03] comes and dwells with us I believe that
[1:13:05] it ought to be something that it ought
[1:13:07] to be a priority to be in the house of
[1:13:08] God so matter of fact the Prophet said
[1:13:10] it very clear if the love of God is in
[1:13:12] your heart then you can't wait for those
[1:13:14] church doors to open good but you see
[1:13:17] it's not about just coming to church if
[1:13:19] it's just about coming together that'll
[1:13:21] get old but if the love of God's in your
[1:13:24] heart then you're expecting God to come
[1:13:27] and speak to you even when you're at
[1:13:30] your lowest time sometimes you're going
[1:13:32] through something but you said I'm going
[1:13:34] there and I know that God is going to
[1:13:37] speak to me I know that God is gonna
[1:13:41] minister to my knee
[1:13:42] [Applause]
[1:13:46] the Bible said the Lord appeared unto
[1:13:48] Solomon the second time as he appeared
[1:13:52] unto Him at Gibeon and the Lord said
[1:13:54] unto Him I have heard that prayer in
[1:13:57] that supplication that thou has made
[1:13:59] before me Solomon was so in tune with
[1:14:04] what God wanted his son to he was so in
[1:14:09] tuned to his prayers were right in line
[1:14:12] with what God's heart the semi do you
[1:14:15] believe that a man can live that way I'm
[1:14:18] proof I believe that that prayers can we
[1:14:22] can be so in tune with the heart and the
[1:14:25] mind of Almighty God it's not that we
[1:14:28] walk around and know it you know I mean
[1:14:29] brother Terah now that you walk around
[1:14:30] saying well I know I've got it sometimes
[1:14:32] you don't even realize maybe when you're
[1:14:34] ministering or sometimes you say
[1:14:35] something to have another brother or
[1:14:36] your sister say something another sister
[1:14:38] you don't even realize it about how the
[1:14:40] Spirit of God would so lead you as you
[1:14:43] are so in tune with God's mind and I
[1:14:51] have hallowed this house which thou has
[1:14:54] built to put my name there forever
[1:14:55] notice was this not a direction of God
[1:14:58] build this house I will put my name
[1:15:00] there what's that not well why did he
[1:15:02] have to pray pray prayer was Lord come
[1:15:06] fulfill your word fulfill your word that
[1:15:10] you have given where is it that we get
[1:15:13] to a place we don't pray instead of
[1:15:17] praying for things because look what God
[1:15:19] has revealed or to say that he has
[1:15:22] opened remember we want it to be
[1:15:25] revealed in us but Ron tells us and
[1:15:29] mighty God unveiled before us he said
[1:15:31] what it is he said we don't seek after
[1:15:33] God that these things are made real to
[1:15:37] us you realize sometimes God he'll speak
[1:15:41] things right here within within the
[1:15:43] service there's things you can be
[1:15:45] reading in the scriptures things you can
[1:15:47] hear out across as you're listening to
[1:15:48] the message and you look and you say you
[1:15:50] know what your heart says O God let it
[1:15:52] be Lord you say well why would God do
[1:15:54] that because he wants
[1:15:56] us to seek after him if he keeps handing
[1:15:59] us everything handing it to us and we're
[1:16:02] not reaching out for it
[1:16:03] there's not a desire for more than we
[1:16:05] become fat and lazy and that's a problem
[1:16:11] because God said when you get that way
[1:16:12] you forget who did and brought you out
[1:16:14] and gave you this that you didn't get
[1:16:17] yourself who verse 4 and if thou wilt
[1:16:23] walk before me Oh Maha that's a big
[1:16:27] that's a big phrase than that not just
[1:16:29] before the rest of Israel how the rest
[1:16:31] of Israel thinks about you but in my
[1:16:33] eyes as David my father walked in
[1:16:38] integrity that word means completeness
[1:16:40] and fullness of heart and in uprightness
[1:16:42] to do according to all that I have
[1:16:44] commanded thee and will keep my statutes
[1:16:47] and my judgments God goes on to tell him
[1:16:50] I will establish the throne of that
[1:16:52] Kingdom upon Israel forever as I
[1:16:54] promised to David thy father saying
[1:16:56] there shall not fail thee a man upon the
[1:16:58] throne of Israel but if ye shall turn at
[1:17:02] all from following me ye or your
[1:17:08] children will not keep my Commandments
[1:17:11] and my statutes without set before you
[1:17:13] but go and serve other gods and worship
[1:17:16] them then will I cut you off Israel out
[1:17:20] of the land which I have given them and
[1:17:23] this house which I've handled for my
[1:17:25] name I will cast out of my sight and
[1:17:27] Israel shall be a proverb and a byword
[1:17:30] among all people and at this house which
[1:17:35] is high every one that passeth by shall
[1:17:38] be astonished and shall hiss and they
[1:17:40] shall say why half the Lord done this
[1:17:43] unto this land and to this house and
[1:17:46] they shall answer because they forsook
[1:17:49] the Lord their God who brought forth
[1:17:52] their fathers out of the land of Egypt
[1:17:54] and have taken hold upon other gods and
[1:17:57] have worshipped them and served them
[1:17:59] therefore hath the Lord brought upon
[1:18:01] them all this evil so God was not
[1:18:07] sitting there in a manner of
[1:18:09] it's always going to be here my presence
[1:18:12] is always going to be here
[1:18:13] but God let him know if you turn away
[1:18:16] from me at all I will pull back my
[1:18:19] presence Oh God
[1:18:22] what good does it do to have a building
[1:18:25] without his presence I hope you
[1:18:28] understand me what good does it do to
[1:18:30] have a message without his presence what
[1:18:34] good does it do to have a Bible without
[1:18:36] his presence you see you can hold these
[1:18:42] things you can hold date you can hold
[1:18:43] look you can come all that but remember
[1:18:45] to capture the presence of God it takes
[1:18:49] a heart that is fully surrendered a
[1:18:54] heart that is surrender Doeg a heart
[1:18:58] that is surrendered to God it captures
[1:19:01] his presence
[1:19:03] it'll stop him it'll get his attention a
[1:19:07] heart that is surrender to him no wonder
[1:19:13] Solomon could say this building he said
[1:19:16] cannot contain me but a house the house
[1:19:20] that the Lord shall build
[1:19:28] this parallel was Salomon that we've
[1:19:32] just started reading here you know I'm
[1:19:35] you know where it lasted for a period of
[1:19:38] time it's very much so the parallel of
[1:19:42] what took place with the Gentile Church
[1:19:45] ages after the Holy Ghost was poured out
[1:19:48] on the day of Pentecost it was about
[1:19:51] twenty years in there after until the
[1:19:54] start of the first church age but when
[1:19:56] the first church age began the one but
[1:19:58] woman the church was already fallen but
[1:20:01] you see God's desire is to bring his
[1:20:04] church back the way he started it at the
[1:20:07] beginning on the day of Pentecost you
[1:20:09] recall when you look back in the
[1:20:11] scriptures the Bible even is such a
[1:20:13] parallel between that of Solomon when
[1:20:15] the presence of God is descending down
[1:20:18] into the temple of God the Shekinah
[1:20:20] glory of how that all of the musicians
[1:20:22] and all of them who were there they were
[1:20:24] all together the Bible would say sounded
[1:20:27] as one there was a unity they were in
[1:20:30] one mind and one Accord but then as we
[1:20:32] look at it the parallel that speaks
[1:20:35] right here you eventually begin to see a
[1:20:37] drifting because what we're looking at
[1:20:39] and what we begin to look at last week
[1:20:41] is how that this country has got to
[1:20:44] where it's got to how did Israel get to
[1:20:47] where it got to
[1:20:48] it didn't just morph to Ahab overnight
[1:20:52] it did just all of a sudden bang it
[1:20:55] happened
[1:20:56] sin is gradual rhythm and puts it like
[1:21:03] this let me just read a few portions
[1:21:05] from Jezebel religion what happened to
[1:21:08] Israel after all this godly background
[1:21:11] they begin to get carefree oh that's an
[1:21:18] attitude carefree it's it's a heart
[1:21:22] condition they begin to get to a place
[1:21:26] where they well they didn't care what
[1:21:31] went on I mean they're the chosen where
[1:21:35] Israel brother Graham goes on to say
[1:21:37] David was our Father shall
[1:21:40] was our Father is that supposed to keep
[1:21:42] the devil back we've had a messenger in
[1:21:46] this day is that supposed to keep the
[1:21:47] devil back it's got to be the same
[1:21:50] messenger who used a messenger that is
[1:21:53] in our hearts it's got to be the same
[1:21:57] Holy Ghost in us it's not how much we
[1:22:02] know the message the doctrines it's how
[1:22:05] much are we yielded to the God who
[1:22:08] brought it that this word would be
[1:22:11] placed in us think of it when brother
[1:22:14] Adam is preaching the seals what's he
[1:22:15] doing he's talking about a union a
[1:22:18] marriage that I just performed in the
[1:22:20] back office may it be a witness and a
[1:22:23] prophecy of what's gonna take place this
[1:22:26] week what is it he's presenting the
[1:22:29] tabernacle of God how because the
[1:22:32] tabernacle of God is come through all of
[1:22:35] the word that's been stored up down
[1:22:37] through the ages and then the
[1:22:41] administration of Solomon it's a
[1:22:43] gathering of all the Lucien's
[1:22:44] all the parts that's been laid down
[1:22:46] through there and bringing it together
[1:22:48] than what that Christ Himself might step
[1:22:51] into the body they didn't care what when
[1:22:59] they begin to get slack in their worship
[1:23:03] to God and in care although they held a
[1:23:09] form of religion just like we had we
[1:23:12] have they had a form of godliness but
[1:23:15] they begin to get free with their people
[1:23:17] and they begin to bring in different
[1:23:19] heresies in their church it didn't
[1:23:25] arrive that they have overnight but if
[1:23:28] you remember the scripture speaks of
[1:23:31] Lucifer thou art he who did it weaken
[1:23:36] the nation's deceive the nation's Satan
[1:23:43] does not have the power to overthrow
[1:23:46] outside of deception
[1:23:50] there's got to be a weakening he could
[1:23:54] not come into the Garden of Eden and lay
[1:23:56] his hands upon Eve until she walked out
[1:24:00] from behind the word as he talked to her
[1:24:04] however many days it was however long
[1:24:07] each duration of time it was to weaken
[1:24:12] causing her to let down to remove the
[1:24:17] penalty from her let me just tell you
[1:24:20] there's a real hell it's burning there
[1:24:25] is a hell it's not made for humans it's
[1:24:30] prepared for the devil and his angels
[1:24:32] but it's a real place and outside of
[1:24:37] knowing the Lord Jesus Christ and making
[1:24:41] him accepting him as your Savior and
[1:24:43] being filled with his spirit it's a sure
[1:24:48] place you see your destination this
[1:24:52] morning you can know it very clear but
[1:24:55] if it looks like your destination it's
[1:24:57] headed that way you say well how would I
[1:25:00] know
[1:25:00] what's the desire of your heart what
[1:25:02] brother Samuel I mean you know I want to
[1:25:03] serve God but is that really our burning
[1:25:06] in your heart or is it just something
[1:25:08] that you're saying or are you really
[1:25:10] sold out to it lock stock and barrel is
[1:25:14] it a testimony in your life the way that
[1:25:17] others can see you living that that
[1:25:19] indeed is a Christian it doesn't look
[1:25:22] like you're a Christian does it look
[1:25:24] holiness does it look godliness
[1:25:26] does it look pleasing to the Lord or is
[1:25:29] it more like the world if it looks like
[1:25:32] the world than its influences from below
[1:25:36] remember when brother Branham he said
[1:25:38] right there in JC Penney's he got sick
[1:25:41] the escalator came up and he's seen him
[1:25:45] with painted eyes he said just this way
[1:25:48] and there was those women they were
[1:25:54] painted up
[1:25:55] you know what pain is it's a facade it's
[1:25:59] a covering it's to try to make a
[1:26:01] presentation to try to cover up
[1:26:04] something that's there yeah you know
[1:26:06] what real paint daughters of God don't
[1:26:08] need paint once you've been painted by
[1:26:10] the blood of Jesus Christ on your soul
[1:26:12] you've got a covering that's real that's
[1:26:15] effectual that's alive on the inside of
[1:26:18] you and you recognize that beauty is in
[1:26:21] the eye of the beholder it is a beauty
[1:26:24] that is appealing to the Lord
[1:26:28] begin to get carefree well you know it
[1:26:31] don't matter just little by little
[1:26:34] little but remember what Delilah did
[1:26:38] Delilah
[1:26:39] just told Samson just let me know where
[1:26:42] your power and eyes if I can find where
[1:26:44] the secret of your strength is I'll
[1:26:47] dismantle you now watch how Solomon here
[1:26:57] Solomon's praying I'm just going to
[1:26:59] focus skip some of this for time but
[1:27:02] Solomon he addresses the people and he's
[1:27:06] blessing the congregation in first Kings
[1:27:08] eight and he says concerning it that how
[1:27:12] that you know that the Lord God that he
[1:27:14] would be with us in verse 57 as he was
[1:27:17] with our fathers let him not leave us
[1:27:19] nor forsake us that he may incline our
[1:27:23] hearts unto him you know that's a
[1:27:26] beautiful word incline you see God wants
[1:27:31] you and I following and doing because we
[1:27:36] have a desire that he has placed within
[1:27:38] us in an amazing within a service how
[1:27:42] the Spirit of God will sweep right down
[1:27:44] and it draws you to say yes sergeant
[1:27:47] what's he doing inclining our heart
[1:27:51] he's inclining our heart God does not
[1:27:55] want just formalities of words he wants
[1:27:57] our hearts to be behind it notice how
[1:28:02] that he would go on Solomon would pray
[1:28:04] this I want to just leave this here he
[1:28:07] says in verse 61 let your heart
[1:28:11] therefore he's talking the blessing on
[1:28:13] the congregation let your heart
[1:28:15] therefore be
[1:28:17] perfect with the Lord our God to walk in
[1:28:21] his statutes and to keep his
[1:28:23] Commandments as at this day let it be
[1:28:26] complete
[1:28:27] let it be perfect now remember this is
[1:28:30] what David has prayed and told Solomon
[1:28:34] served the Lord with a complete heart
[1:28:38] with a willing mind a desire of the
[1:28:42] light to please him you know sometimes
[1:28:46] people just don't know what's right and
[1:28:47] what's wrong but when you tell them the
[1:28:50] word if there's something within their
[1:28:52] heart they rise up to and say amen I
[1:28:55] didn't see it before
[1:28:57] didn't realize this before but Amen it's
[1:29:00] in the word and I believe that this is
[1:29:02] God's desire for me you see what it is
[1:29:05] how do you respond to the word after the
[1:29:08] word brings correction oh my what a
[1:29:14] wonderful prayer that's been made but
[1:29:16] then when we go back and we moved back
[1:29:19] pages in the scripture and we find in
[1:29:23] some of the very beginnings there was a
[1:29:26] little speck of leaven that was already
[1:29:32] present notice it wasn't mentioned so
[1:29:36] much in some of these chapters that
[1:29:39] we've read it only was like a little
[1:29:42] speck that was mentioned but the Bible
[1:29:46] says in first Kings 3:1 and Solomon made
[1:29:51] affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt God
[1:29:56] had brought him out of Egypt God never
[1:30:01] one of his people tied up in alliances
[1:30:04] with Egypt but a Solomon made affinity
[1:30:09] that is against God's Word yet Solomon
[1:30:14] chosen of God but notice what you begin
[1:30:17] to see is the unfolding here of these
[1:30:19] church ages you begin to see one little
[1:30:22] speck of leaven leavens the whole lump
[1:30:26] let me tell you something sin you can't
[1:30:29] Corral it you can't contain it
[1:30:31] you can't confine it to one little place
[1:30:33] remember sin itself will defile it'll
[1:30:36] spread through your life it's not one
[1:30:41] little area well I'll just happen in
[1:30:43] this chamber remember a heart it might
[1:30:47] be a heart that's 95% given to God but
[1:30:50] yet not a perfect heart a perfect heart
[1:30:53] is a complete oh my an affinity that
[1:30:59] were marriages remember what marriages
[1:31:01] do marriages brother man made it very
[1:31:04] clear he I love the way said it he said
[1:31:07] you take a bad man and a good woman
[1:31:09] they get married he said that man who
[1:31:10] either become a good man or she's going
[1:31:12] to become a bad woman union's themselves
[1:31:16] remember that's exactly how Satan how
[1:31:19] does Satan deal to invoke and bring
[1:31:22] God's judgment on is to bring about
[1:31:24] wrongful unions think about the very
[1:31:29] inspiration of the of the Gentile
[1:31:31] kingdoms of that which Daniel saw that
[1:31:34] fourth Kingdom it was iron that was
[1:31:36] spread throughout the clay the Bible
[1:31:38] said it would cause the seed to mingle
[1:31:41] with the seed of others what was it to
[1:31:43] break the power come on friends it
[1:31:46] wasn't just things were Protestants
[1:31:49] marrying Catholics but it's inner any
[1:31:51] inner breeding where the Word of God
[1:31:54] becomes hybridized
[1:31:55] the power is lost the authority is lost
[1:31:59] the holiness is lost its lost when it
[1:32:01] becomes mixed with the world sin enters
[1:32:12] through Union I watch this in second
[1:32:16] chronicles 8:11 Solomon watch this
[1:32:20] brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out
[1:32:23] of the City of David unto the house that
[1:32:26] he built for her and he said my wife
[1:32:29] shall not dwell in the house of David
[1:32:32] king of Israel because the places
[1:32:35] our holy wearing to the Ark of the Lord
[1:32:38] had come oh that sounds good don't it
[1:32:41] sheesh she can't dwell here if she can't
[1:32:45] dwell there you had no business marrying
[1:32:47] her come on somebody you had no business
[1:32:51] man her if she can't come into the house
[1:32:54] of God with you you had no business
[1:32:56] marrying her but Solomon ooh I can't let
[1:33:00] her remain here this place is holy old
[1:33:03] MA it shows every union the Bible is
[1:33:06] clear give no place to the devil in all
[1:33:09] you do in word or deed let it be done in
[1:33:12] the name of Jesus Christ if you can't do
[1:33:15] it in the name of Jesus Christ then let
[1:33:17] the Church of the Living God
[1:33:18] deep plot from sin you can't wear a
[1:33:25] split skirt in the name of Jesus you
[1:33:28] can't wear high heels in the name of
[1:33:30] Jesus Christ you can't wear painting
[1:33:33] nails in the name of Jesus Christ rather
[1:33:36] you can't look like a in the name
[1:33:38] of Jesus Christ come on somebody you
[1:33:42] can't listen to worldly music in the
[1:33:44] name of Jesus Christ over Samuel I'll
[1:33:48] listen to it off the fish that's stuff a
[1:33:50] number a bunch of trash come on somebody
[1:33:55] the things such worldly ism singing
[1:34:00] songs had nothing to do with Jesus
[1:34:03] look I'm not that old I'm a very young
[1:34:06] young man only 43 years old brother
[1:34:10] Terry with Amen that but you know I
[1:34:14] would go in the bookstore and you know
[1:34:16] what I'd see this is the little book
[1:34:18] stores in Elyria mall they had a little
[1:34:20] flip chart there and you know what it
[1:34:21] said on the flip chart if you like rap
[1:34:23] this is what you like here if you like
[1:34:26] R&B this is what you like here now we're
[1:34:29] talking this is back in the ancient days
[1:34:31] if you liked Metallica or heavy metal
[1:34:35] this is what you're like you see what it
[1:34:37] is substituting
[1:34:43] God hates substitution
[1:34:46] God loves reality I'm tell your friends
[1:34:52] there's a lot of things that need to be
[1:34:54] checked and listen it ain't just stuff
[1:34:55] there I'm telling you what I look at a
[1:34:57] lot of the things with southern gospel
[1:34:58] you wouldn't know if they're gonna start
[1:35:00] singing about the hound dog next or how
[1:35:04] they return somebody's wife they stole
[1:35:06] off this or whatever more it's saying
[1:35:08] all around we have a filter that's been
[1:35:13] given to us there is no excuse we've got
[1:35:17] a filter and that filter will never ever
[1:35:20] give us death it will always give us
[1:35:23] life but it matters what the desires are
[1:35:26] on the inside it's important that our
[1:35:30] desire is in line with God it's
[1:35:35] important to flee from sin without
[1:35:41] fleeing for sin you got to start
[1:35:42] worrying about adversaries you got to
[1:35:45] start worrying but if you just walk with
[1:35:47] God God said I'll be an adversary to
[1:35:48] your adversaries I'll be an enmity I'll
[1:35:51] be an enemy to your enemies Solomon had
[1:35:56] no business marrying her if he couldn't
[1:35:58] bring her in the house of God shouldn't
[1:36:00] even look at her he knew this is one
[1:36:02] that is all oh my goodness I just I
[1:36:05] don't know I mean you know but Solomon
[1:36:07] maybe Solomon showed up and Solomon came
[1:36:09] to the pastor and said pastor you know
[1:36:11] we believe in this election of God how
[1:36:13] can you pray and make him elect what
[1:36:15] nonsense come on friends prayer is the
[1:36:20] key come on somebody there's two things
[1:36:24] that the Prophet laid out in choosing of
[1:36:26] a bride prayer and study it over two
[1:36:29] simple simple things prayer give no
[1:36:39] place to the devil
[1:36:41] don't be unequally yoked you better know
[1:36:47] what they believe
[1:36:48] brother Daniel they go to message Church
[1:36:50] you better know what they believe you
[1:36:54] better make sure you're not just getting
[1:36:56] somebody with formality you better get
[1:37:00] somebody who loves God more than they
[1:37:01] love you because if they love God more
[1:37:03] than they love you when you get down
[1:37:06] they'll pick you up they'll punch you in
[1:37:08] the right way you want somebody that's
[1:37:11] connected with God you want a real
[1:37:14] Alliance a real union somebody who's
[1:37:18] there you want a godly husband that can
[1:37:20] say little too tight honey it's a little
[1:37:22] too short you need to lower it down
[1:37:29] we're separated people but not because
[1:37:33] we're message people were separated by
[1:37:36] the presence of God oh man brother
[1:37:40] Branham talks about a creeping paralysis
[1:37:42] and impotence on the lack of a power and
[1:37:45] authority they began to drift when
[1:37:47] people had begun to drift from the altar
[1:37:49] huh adulterated truth of the first few
[1:37:51] years after Pentecost look at these
[1:37:53] words some earn an age and no true
[1:37:57] believer is any stronger and spiritually
[1:38:02] healthy and alive than his knowledge of
[1:38:06] and adherence to the pure Word of God
[1:38:13] knowledge of and adherence to it not
[1:38:16] just knowledge of it and he rents to it
[1:38:20] the brand goes on to tell us those
[1:38:23] unlawful alliances what it led to
[1:38:26] I want you to think of this here's try
[1:38:30] to find someplace here to get off
[1:38:34] Solomon's
[1:38:38] Rich's his wisdom the Bible says in
[1:38:44] first Kings 10:23 it exceeded all the
[1:38:46] kings of the earth exceeded all the
[1:38:53] earth sought to hear his wisdom Solomon
[1:38:57] was the preacher on the docket at the
[1:39:00] meetings and don't take me wrong you
[1:39:03] understand they sought to hear him why
[1:39:11] wanted to hear what God had put in his
[1:39:13] heart the Bible goes on to say in verse
[1:39:16] 25 and on down
[1:39:17] they brought every man his present he
[1:39:20] was recognized a tribute and honor to
[1:39:24] what God was doing but this next
[1:39:30] sure the beginning of chapter 11 after
[1:39:35] you've just come out of chapter 10 where
[1:39:38] the Queen of Sheba is the Queen of Sheba
[1:39:40] comes in and sees his house she sees
[1:39:45] even how that the meat is served she
[1:39:49] watches how he even walks up the steps
[1:39:51] and the Bible says she's seen how
[1:39:54] everything was so set in order in his
[1:39:57] house she said there was no spirit left
[1:40:02] with him it took away her breath this
[1:40:09] was something that was known a gift that
[1:40:12] God had placed within Israel and the
[1:40:15] people of Israel were rallying around
[1:40:18] the gift of God but verse one says but
[1:40:25] sometimes that's a good word when it
[1:40:29] says things like you who were dead in
[1:40:31] sins but this is not a good time for you
[1:40:36] but King Solomon loved many strange
[1:40:42] women together with the daughter of
[1:40:46] pharaoh women of the moabites ammonites
[1:40:49] Sidonians and Hittites remember
[1:40:53] Jezebel was of the sidonians but
[1:40:56] evidently the one he married her daddy
[1:40:58] won the priest but you see a little
[1:41:02] heaven it wasn't enough just to have one
[1:41:05] strange wife you gotta have more he was
[1:41:09] addicted it grew in his heart
[1:41:14] it wasn't something he could just put a
[1:41:17] chain on and say you can't go no further
[1:41:19] in this it'll just be this right here no
[1:41:21] it'll keep going it'll lead from one
[1:41:24] thing to another to another to another
[1:41:28] sin takes ground but has sin takes
[1:41:33] ground so does righteousness stay ground
[1:41:35] as you're willing to allow your heart to
[1:41:38] be touched by dog gotta move right in
[1:41:41] there the Spirit of God will keep moving
[1:41:43] he'll push out all of the things as we
[1:41:46] allow him of the nation's concerning
[1:41:53] which the Lord said unto the children of
[1:41:55] Israel you shall not go into them
[1:41:56] neither shall they come in unto you for
[1:41:59] surely they will turn away your heart
[1:42:03] after their gods Solomon clave unto
[1:42:07] these in love this is what's amazing
[1:42:14] here is a man who stood in the presence
[1:42:18] of God here is a man who was so aligned
[1:42:20] with God's heart that he could pray and
[1:42:23] God said I heard what you said that's
[1:42:26] what mom that's what my heart is
[1:42:27] concerning it how did he get to this
[1:42:30] place how does it come to a place to
[1:42:33] where he loves many strange women and it
[1:42:38] gets to this spot he's neglecting an
[1:42:41] area
[1:42:43] in his life he said that God's not
[1:42:47] dealing with it all no God's dealing
[1:42:48] with him he knows better it's not
[1:42:51] ignorant
[1:42:51] he knows God's dealing with him but yet
[1:42:54] he just keeps looking at it in a manner
[1:42:57] I got it under control
[1:42:59] let me tell you friends don't mistake
[1:43:02] the Spirit of God falling here in these
[1:43:05] services as you're okay the Spirit of
[1:43:10] God moves down in these services to
[1:43:11] bring conviction in your heart not to
[1:43:14] okay and put a cross on your T or a dot
[1:43:17] on your eye it comes down to move within
[1:43:20] our lives it ought to be a real witness
[1:43:25] that you know my heart has been drawn
[1:43:28] closer to God my life has been touched
[1:43:32] by God you leave out of here with a
[1:43:34] greater more fervent desire to serve Him
[1:43:39] not out of here for his God huh I made
[1:43:42] it to church today my one that a
[1:43:44] wonderful service miles say the presence
[1:43:47] of God just fell what did it do for you
[1:43:51] what did they do for you
[1:43:53] I'll tell you what it did for Moses when
[1:43:54] he got in the presence of God
[1:43:56] it made him realize like it did Isaiah
[1:43:59] I'm on done I am not fit for the task
[1:44:05] I'm talking about even when Collin has
[1:44:08] dental work in your life the presence of
[1:44:10] God brings humility it brings the place
[1:44:15] I want more Lord help me Lord God I want
[1:44:18] to live closer to you more determine
[1:44:20] what's he doing he's stirring up he's
[1:44:23] quickening the word that he's already
[1:44:26] sown in our hearts brother sister we're
[1:44:29] not operating by manpower were operating
[1:44:32] by quickening power his feelings his
[1:44:38] emotions the prince of god has come down
[1:44:44] he's been there
[1:44:47] but Solomon keeps going keeps going the
[1:44:52] Bible goes on to say in verse 3 his
[1:44:55] wives turned away his heart not his body
[1:45:01] his heart a lot of times people can stay
[1:45:05] in body and the hearts already gone
[1:45:07] they'll bring a body to church but the
[1:45:09] hearts outside somewhere else the heart
[1:45:12] is nowhere before the throne of God they
[1:45:14] really don't have no desire to be in the
[1:45:15] house of God they just simply show up
[1:45:17] because well you know it's Sunday
[1:45:19] there's nothing else to do oh my this is
[1:45:21] the greatest privilege of your life this
[1:45:24] will not always be this is a period of
[1:45:26] time for you and I have to be fed and be
[1:45:29] nourished don't you wait till the church
[1:45:35] doors are closed up it might be too late
[1:45:39] for you then but brother Samuel the
[1:45:41] bride still here but remember the door
[1:45:43] of the Ark was shut before rain ever
[1:45:46] fail we're living in the time of the
[1:45:50] third Pope we're living in the kind
[1:45:52] where the voice of God that's been
[1:45:55] building the preparation of the Ark down
[1:45:58] through the ages where the voice of God
[1:46:01] is heard from within the Ark come in
[1:46:05] come in and remember no I've been shut
[1:46:09] the door God called him in and God shut
[1:46:14] the door this is the day of mercy this
[1:46:17] is the day to get right with God this is
[1:46:21] today to make the Lord thy absolute to
[1:46:26] let him be the Lord of your life his
[1:46:33] body was still in church but his heart
[1:46:36] was gone
[1:46:43] it came to pass when Solomon was old
[1:46:45] that his wives turned away his heart
[1:46:48] after their gods and his heart look at
[1:46:52] this was not perfect complete with the
[1:46:57] Lord his God he makes you scratch your
[1:46:58] head you think he built the house of God
[1:47:01] all of this was done but his heart was
[1:47:07] not complete
[1:47:08] you see even then in the midst of all
[1:47:11] that was going on his heart wasn't
[1:47:13] complete
[1:47:14] it might started out one little speck
[1:47:18] but then it grew until all of a sudden
[1:47:23] people around him say what happened to
[1:47:26] him it was a speck that girl it was an
[1:47:33] area that wasn't surrendered it was a
[1:47:36] part that wasn't attended to you see
[1:47:39] where Solomon's problem was he was
[1:47:42] living on a past reputation he was
[1:47:45] living on past visitations God visited
[1:47:48] me once
[1:47:49] God spoke this through my daddy God
[1:47:51] spoke this through here but you know
[1:47:53] what you don't live by past reputations
[1:47:55] you can't live by what God did just last
[1:47:59] week that ain't good enough
[1:48:01] it's what about today it isn't about
[1:48:06] what you wore brother BAM said a
[1:48:07] question/answer 64 it's not about what
[1:48:09] you were 20 years ago what are you today
[1:48:13] you can't take 20 years ago and go
[1:48:16] before the presence of God that might
[1:48:18] have been gained an entrance a time ago
[1:48:20] you understand but the word it's real
[1:48:22] gone brother it comes to a time there's
[1:48:25] got to be an advancement in your life
[1:48:27] and one time it was all right you could
[1:48:30] say praise God God sent a prophet but
[1:48:33] that's not enough in this hour
[1:48:35] you've gotta recognize there's a message
[1:48:38] that has come a message that called us
[1:48:41] out of darkness that he himself might
[1:48:44] step inside of us and take us in rapture
[1:48:49] it's not enough to go upon a past
[1:48:52] reputation sudden you have all kinds of
[1:48:55] memories I have memories from when I was
[1:48:57] a little boy meetings and things would
[1:48:59] take place in camp meetings and all
[1:49:01] those things and hold brother Samuel if
[1:49:04] we can only go back to those days those
[1:49:05] were wonderful times but I wouldn't
[1:49:07] trade where I'm at right now for back
[1:49:08] there I will not trade in whatsoever the
[1:49:11] word itself it's richer his presence the
[1:49:14] reality of what God is in my life I
[1:49:17] wouldn't trade it for nothing but you
[1:49:20] know what the difference is the
[1:49:22] difference is depending on how you've
[1:49:24] given your heart to God Solomon said I
[1:49:30] got your building done said I know I
[1:49:32] want your heart yeah but I built you a
[1:49:35] building but I want your heart but Lord
[1:49:37] look at this building you know but I
[1:49:38] want your heart God was interested in
[1:49:41] Solomon's heart the Bible goes on to say
[1:49:50] here can I just have a few more moments
[1:49:54] [Music]
[1:49:56] Solomon went after aster offers five the
[1:49:59] goddess of the sidonians and after
[1:50:02] milking the abomination of the ammonites
[1:50:04] and Solomon did evil in the sight of the
[1:50:10] Lord maybe in the rest of the
[1:50:12] congregation he's the upright guy
[1:50:15] but in God's eyes God said you're doing
[1:50:19] evil he sees let me tell you something
[1:50:24] what you do at your house if you
[1:50:27] couldn't invite anybody else from the
[1:50:28] church and you do it then you don't need
[1:50:31] to be doing it anything you can't do in
[1:50:35] faith is sin if they're saying look at
[1:50:41] this or I'll do that if you can't do
[1:50:43] that and invite somebody from here how
[1:50:45] in the world do you think to heaven the
[1:50:46] one in the presence of God in your home
[1:50:48] that he can come and sit down in your
[1:50:50] home come on somebody if he is and
[1:50:54] welcome he's only made welcome as you
[1:50:56] and I make him welcome
[1:51:00] so much of the time we look at services
[1:51:03] oh I want a good service do you realize
[1:51:05] what makes a good service it's not just
[1:51:08] you getting prepared on a Sunday morning
[1:51:10] getting up praying getting to church
[1:51:13] here a little early
[1:51:14] coming in pray and read your Bible
[1:51:16] getting ready make it look like you're
[1:51:18] anxious for something I didn't get an
[1:51:22] amen but I'm gonna preach anyhow make it
[1:51:25] look like it's a delight to come to the
[1:51:27] house of God that it's something you're
[1:51:29] waiting on that I'm waiting on God to
[1:51:32] come down not barely squeaking in the
[1:51:34] parking lot in the church doors but
[1:51:37] coming here at the place of anticipation
[1:51:39] to meet with God it's not just about
[1:51:42] that it turns on a half hour beforehand
[1:51:45] your preparation and meeting with God it
[1:51:48] ought to be every day of your life if
[1:51:51] the only time you get service about
[1:51:53] serious about serving God is on
[1:51:55] Thursdays if you do come on Thursday
[1:51:57] some of you and if it's on Sundays if
[1:51:59] that's the only time you're backslidden
[1:52:02] you're not really loving God the way you
[1:52:05] are - you're letting other things creep
[1:52:08] into your life that you all know let
[1:52:10] creep in let me tell you friends there's
[1:52:11] a lot of schedules there's a lot of
[1:52:13] things that can come your way that could
[1:52:15] try to hold you out all brother Samuel
[1:52:16] but if I have to do this and I have to
[1:52:18] do that listen your beer smart people
[1:52:20] you can evaluate what it is that's
[1:52:22] necessary and what it is you're allowing
[1:52:24] to crowd out your time with God come on
[1:52:28] the Holy Spirit is there he's able to
[1:52:31] bring conviction you know this is where
[1:52:33] it's very important when we look at the
[1:52:35] presence of God and services it's not
[1:52:37] something that the pastor packs in his
[1:52:40] bag
[1:52:40] it's not something that the musicians
[1:52:42] have or the song leader has it is a
[1:52:45] condition of the heart from brother
[1:52:51] Sandra when I come to the house of God I
[1:52:52] expect you and lifted up some of you
[1:52:55] I've been carrying around on my back so
[1:52:56] long about getting tired why don't you
[1:53:00] start being one who lifts others up
[1:53:02] instead of being worn who needs to be
[1:53:03] toted and packed around all the time
[1:53:05] I don't mind packing around the
[1:53:07] tabernacle of God but there's a time
[1:53:09] when you unpack it you unfold it you set
[1:53:11] it up and the presence of God comes down
[1:53:13] it out but it shouldn't be something
[1:53:16] that's packed over and over and over
[1:53:18] again it ought to be a place that set up
[1:53:21] that the presence of God can come down
[1:53:23] I know it's hard preaching but it will
[1:53:27] help you if you say man oh yeah it'll
[1:53:31] help you say man you watch the next
[1:53:33] couple services will be even more loose
[1:53:35] than they are right now Solomon did evil
[1:53:40] in the sight of the Lord and went not
[1:53:42] fully after the Lord as David his father
[1:53:50] he did evil
[1:53:51] well what's evil halfway halfway zville
[1:53:57] anything less than full and complete
[1:53:59] surrender is evil well if this if God
[1:54:04] will if this not full surrender
[1:54:06] it's got to be complete full surrender
[1:54:09] it's got to be him
[1:54:12] not just coming to this church because
[1:54:14] well it's a good church I I feel
[1:54:16] comfortable here don't let that be the
[1:54:20] reason but why is it that that you would
[1:54:24] come here maybe for some of you it's the
[1:54:26] only relief you have out of demon
[1:54:27] oppression and torments that comes
[1:54:29] around your life but let me tell you
[1:54:30] something you can have a Liberty than
[1:54:32] when you walk out this door them same
[1:54:34] demons that I have to flee under the
[1:54:36] preaching of the word you can have that
[1:54:37] same power within your soul you can have
[1:54:39] that same liberator that when you go out
[1:54:41] there that score mentor or a presser can
[1:54:43] come and you've got the goods on the
[1:54:45] inside because there's a stronger man
[1:54:47] let's move to the inside and it's pour
[1:54:50] down the strength of that one that's
[1:54:52] there there is a living power of a
[1:54:56] Living God where you find it hard to do
[1:55:00] this and I found it hard to live this
[1:55:02] way and find it hard to but if you ever
[1:55:04] meet him he will free you from what you
[1:55:06] think his freedom he will free you from
[1:55:08] the bondage of sin he will bring it a
[1:55:11] Liberty to we're living holy it's a
[1:55:15] pleasure it's a delight when he says let
[1:55:19] your hair grow you say thank you Lord I
[1:55:21] realize the Lord God what that
[1:55:22] represents when he says dress modestly
[1:55:25] free flowing clothing use
[1:55:27] thank you lord I realize my body is
[1:55:30] preserved for you hello its holiness
[1:55:34] unto the Lord I realized sometimes I
[1:55:39] can't get on today but I realized
[1:55:41] sometimes even on the men they've got to
[1:55:42] get get on sometimes we've got a bunch
[1:55:45] of sissies that's designing clothes
[1:55:47] nowadays come on somebody you go into
[1:55:51] the clothing rack and everything else
[1:55:53] everything's skinny tighten whatever
[1:55:54] more who designed that the same editors
[1:55:59] because you like your clothes loose well
[1:56:01] I mean like my clothes loose but I sure
[1:56:04] don't want to wear tight clothes I don't
[1:56:07] think it's becoming when I had tight
[1:56:08] clothes you know what mama did do the
[1:56:10] tight clothes put him in a GW bag and we
[1:56:13] took him to Goodwill because you know
[1:56:15] what they were too small to wear
[1:56:21] nowadays are too small to wear give them
[1:56:24] to somebody who's twice as big as you
[1:56:28] that's free that's free I'm talking
[1:56:33] about living before God in holiness
[1:56:38] Solomon built all these high places of
[1:56:40] verse 70 motion abomination and mohab in
[1:56:43] the heel that's poor for Jerusalem
[1:56:45] Moloch and the abomination of the
[1:56:47] children of Amon and likewise he did for
[1:56:49] all his strange wives which burn incense
[1:56:54] and sacrificed unto their God Solomon
[1:57:02] was a gifted man he know how to take a
[1:57:05] pattern and bring that pattern forth but
[1:57:11] there are certain patterns he didn't
[1:57:14] need to learn in his life there's
[1:57:16] certain patterns strains that he needed
[1:57:20] to overcome because these patterns of
[1:57:23] these houses these were God's houses for
[1:57:27] the gods of these women that he loved he
[1:57:31] made a place for them so that they would
[1:57:34] feel comfortable
[1:57:35] I don't know about you I don't want sin
[1:57:38] to feel comfortable I don't want the
[1:57:41] devil to feel comfortable I want him to
[1:57:43] squirm when things walk in that's not
[1:57:49] right with God we want to burn it open
[1:57:53] the same you ain't thinking about their
[1:57:54] heart well no I am thinking about your
[1:57:55] heart because if your heart isn't
[1:57:58] rescued by God that very thing going on
[1:58:00] can take you to a devil's hell God cares
[1:58:04] about every part of his word this is
[1:58:09] where James could say do not air my
[1:58:11] beloved brother look at this here's
[1:58:22] David God regards David as a perfect
[1:58:25] heart that is a paradox to me you say
[1:58:31] you say well what about that of the sin
[1:58:33] of Bathsheba that was there but there's
[1:58:38] one thing that's different is you go on
[1:58:39] and read here in the scripture God comes
[1:58:42] to Solomon and he tells Solomon because
[1:58:45] you haven't heeded to what I've
[1:58:47] commanded you the kingdom is gonna be
[1:58:51] rent from your hands I'm not gonna do it
[1:58:55] in the day of your lifetime but I'll do
[1:58:57] it in the days of your son what was his
[1:59:00] strength what was the strength of
[1:59:02] maintaining the kingdom kingdom is power
[1:59:06] Authority was a heart completely
[1:59:12] surrendered to go think about it if
[1:59:14] Solomon did what he did and not all of
[1:59:16] his heart was perfect before God think
[1:59:18] about it what about to a heart that's
[1:59:20] perfectly surrendered to God a heart
[1:59:25] that's perfectly surrendered
[1:59:27] look at this David's life difference
[1:59:31] between David and Solomon sure David had
[1:59:34] his points about him but the difference
[1:59:37] was David was willing to repent when he
[1:59:42] was wronged
[1:59:44] he was a man after God's own heart yet
[1:59:48] one that God was saying David was
[1:59:50] innocent David so good David never done
[1:59:52] nothing wrong no David repented when he
[1:59:55] was wrong
[1:59:55] they've been even knew what the
[1:59:57] sacrifices that I offer up God is not
[2:00:01] pleased with those outside of my heart
[2:00:04] being broken outside of my spirit being
[2:00:08] broken God doesn't want any of those
[2:00:11] other sacrifices David knew what it
[2:00:14] meant to repent and to be lying back up
[2:00:18] when he had gone out a lot he knew what
[2:00:20] it was to come in line but Solomon he
[2:00:23] kept going going and going yeah you know
[2:00:28] this isn't the only place that talks
[2:00:30] about this in Nehemiah Nehemiah stands
[2:00:34] against it and says remember Solomon's
[2:00:38] heart was led astray by outlandish women
[2:00:42] when they came into the land Azra
[2:00:44] Nehemiah
[2:00:45] they had to deal with it when they
[2:00:46] returned back from Babylon they had to
[2:00:49] deal with this mixing up with stuff so
[2:00:52] no God's people are to be separators I
[2:00:56] say were to be separators we're to be
[2:00:59] separate now because of war a message
[2:01:02] not because that we say well we believe
[2:01:03] that God sent a prophet we have a
[2:01:05] prophet we have a Bible no were to be
[2:01:08] separated unto the Lord by the presence
[2:01:12] of God and were separated by the
[2:01:15] presence of God believe me we reflect
[2:01:18] the presence of God in whom we dwell
[2:01:25] let's bow our heads
[2:01:29] I wonder this morning is our hearts just
[2:01:38] mindful before the presence of God
[2:01:41] I know I've ministered long here this
[2:01:46] morning but I pray that it's not escaped
[2:01:51] your hearts think very deeply are you
[2:01:58] closer to God
[2:01:59] now then you were when God first got a
[2:02:05] hold of your life or even last year or
[2:02:08] last month
[2:02:10] [Music]
[2:02:11] or do you notice in your life a subtle
[2:02:16] carelessness becoming carefree certain
[2:02:22] things that you wouldn't even look at
[2:02:24] now you give place to
[2:02:30] certain things you wouldn't even read
[2:02:34] things were there was a fervency to be
[2:02:37] in the house of God to be in the
[2:02:39] presence of God to be gathered together
[2:02:41] with brothers and sisters of like
[2:02:43] precious faith a fervency to live for
[2:02:48] the Lord
[2:02:55] this would be a good moment
[2:02:57] [Music]
[2:02:59] to let your heart has it's been moved by
[2:03:02] God I trust I trust my hearts have been
[2:03:06] moved by the Spirit of God this place
[2:03:09] remembers a said moments and moments ago
[2:03:11] this place is not always guaranteed well
[2:03:14] I can count on coming there the prints
[2:03:16] of God will be there no remember you've
[2:03:18] got your part you may not always be here
[2:03:26] there might be things that you would
[2:03:29] have in your heart you leave unattended
[2:03:30] and it can lead to a coldness in your
[2:03:33] life it can lead to a place to where it
[2:03:38] comes to a moment where did they go
[2:03:41] what happened to him but I wonder this
[2:03:48] morning if in your heart that you say
[2:03:54] Lord I want a perfect heart but remember
[2:03:58] having a perfect heart sometimes there's
[2:04:01] got to be a brokenness within your heart
[2:04:05] ground itself in order for seeds to take
[2:04:08] place remember sometimes there's seeds
[2:04:09] that can be sown but in order to counter
[2:04:13] affect counteract that there's got to be
[2:04:15] some ground that's broken up what I'm
[2:04:20] talking about there's got to be a real
[2:04:21] repentance in your heart real conviction
[2:04:23] that strikes your heart says the Lord I
[2:04:27] want to be closer to you Lord
[2:04:31] I want to lay aside all the foolishness
[2:04:35] of the world
[2:04:36] maybe it's things that you've been
[2:04:39] entertaining things may be in your
[2:04:43] wardrobe you've allowed to creep in you
[2:04:45] never would have allowed to be there
[2:04:46] before but influences one time you never
[2:04:59] would have given to it
[2:05:05] I'll ask you to look very deep
[2:05:12] throughout this building here this
[2:05:14] morning I don't doubt for a moment
[2:05:16] there's hearts they need to be liberated
[2:05:19] you need to be set free
[2:05:23] [Music]
[2:05:26] you need the real true baptism of the
[2:05:29] Holy Ghost to really see what God has
[2:05:32] done for you what he's done already for
[2:05:35] you if you just surrender your life to
[2:05:40] him not to an idea not to a church but
[2:05:47] to him saying what I'll give I want to
[2:05:51] give my all to you right there even in
[2:05:55] your heart you can come right up here to
[2:05:57] the altar the most important thing is is
[2:06:00] that your heart is an altar with God the
[2:06:04] most important thing is is that you
[2:06:07] leave out of here with a desire Lord I
[2:06:12] want the Holy Ghost more than anything
[2:06:16] Lord I want to fully surrender to heart
[2:06:19] Lord not a heart that's halfway maybe a
[2:06:29] heart
[2:06:30] here this morning you've got cold in
[2:06:33] your prayer life you got cold giving
[2:06:39] yourself to the Word of God listening to
[2:06:46] the message not valuing the things that
[2:06:49] God has given us this land the way that
[2:06:51] you ought to valuate maybe not valuing
[2:06:55] his presence when we come here service
[2:06:58] after service where you really give
[2:07:00] yourself to God
[2:07:04] when you like to make that consecration
[2:07:06] this morning say Lord I'm forsaken this
[2:07:10] coldness Lord I was not made to live in
[2:07:14] this coldness I don't want to live here
[2:07:16] I want to live in your presence remember
[2:07:24] before he ever left Israel and for
[2:07:26] sukham they already forsook him he's
[2:07:30] right he's right where you left him
[2:07:34] how many times brother branham will tell
[2:07:36] us maybe you left him at the dinner
[2:07:39] table where you stopped asking blessing
[2:07:41] over your food maybe you left him in the
[2:07:45] prayer closet you left him
[2:07:51] how about at this morning church
[2:07:54] how about it don't you want his presence
[2:07:57] to be the separating factor above
[2:08:01] everything else that that's what God
[2:08:04] said what identifier says his people and
[2:08:10] all he asked for is our heart to be
[2:08:13] surrendered to him this morning why
[2:08:16] don't you just let him search it out oh

[2:08:20] I believe it do us good to really pour
[2:08:23] our hearts out well I'm not calling you
[2:08:28] to an emotion but I'm trying to bring
[2:08:31] you to a place to realize the word
