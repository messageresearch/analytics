[36:00] [Music]
[36:13] [Applause]
[36:14] [Music]
[36:24] she
[36:26] [Music]
[36:38] now
[36:41] [Music]
[36:50] i see what you are
[36:56] [Music]
[37:04] nothing compares to
[37:10] [Music]
[37:16] amen that's the truth isn't it it meant
[37:19] nothing compares to the promise that we
[37:22] have in him
[37:24] amen it's so good to be in the house of
[37:26] the lord tonight and
[37:28] good to see each and every one of you
[37:29] and i just want to
[37:31] remind you the services here on sunday
[37:35] lord willing at 11
[37:37] and then at 6 00 p.m tried to give a
[37:39] little space in there
[37:41] and i know it's a you know it's a great
[37:43] sacrifice
[37:45] to do that on sunday with the two
[37:47] services
[37:49] but we have brother andrew here with us
[37:51] and we just kind of
[37:52] set this aside and we're living you know
[37:55] we
[37:56] are here in some very peculiar times
[37:59] and so trying to you know to do
[38:03] and trying to find the mind of the lord
[38:05] through the time
[38:06] i i certainly believe that god can do
[38:08] everything he wants to do
[38:10] in one service but i i just think this
[38:13] is a
[38:13] we just said it as a special time you
[38:16] know when god came down into
[38:18] sent moses down into egypt and he the
[38:21] first thing that he went to
[38:23] pharaoh with he said you let my people
[38:25] come out three days journey into the
[38:27] wilderness
[38:28] and worship me the whole focus within
[38:30] the deliverance was to be able to
[38:32] worship god
[38:34] the theme within the message of that of
[38:36] the exodus was
[38:37] let my son go that he can serve me we
[38:40] realize that god calls for more than
[38:42] just a worship
[38:43] on two days or one day or however many
[38:46] days of the week but our lives are to be
[38:48] a worship
[38:48] every day of our lives unto him and all
[38:51] that we do
[38:52] and all that we say it's to glorify the
[38:54] name of the lord jesus
[38:56] so i just want to say we just so
[38:58] appreciate
[38:59] brother andrew being able to come here
[39:02] and be with us
[39:03] and let's just be in prayer and let's
[39:06] just
[39:06] expect to receive from the lord we're
[39:09] not coming
[39:10] even as we come tonight we haven't come
[39:12] as spectators we haven't come just to
[39:14] say
[39:14] well i just want to see and see what
[39:17] god's going to do but
[39:18] we come with intentions in our heart
[39:20] there's needs that we have right here
[39:22] tonight there's
[39:23] needs that we will have before us on if
[39:26] the lord tarries on sunday
[39:28] and god is mindful to meet and to
[39:31] minister to every one of our needs
[39:33] and so we just want to keep that before
[39:36] before
[39:37] the lord in prayer and just be looking
[39:40] to the lord
[39:41] for his mercy in this time i wonder if
[39:44] we just couldn't pray
[39:45] as we just go to the lord in prayer
[39:48] tonight and
[39:49] just ask his leadership and his blessing
[39:52] upon the word
[39:54] heavenly father lord we are certainly
[39:57] standing here tonight
[39:59] lord in need of your help
[40:03] lord it is so true that we can do
[40:06] nothing
[40:06] without you lord all of our greatest of
[40:10] efforts
[40:11] will fail lord the greatest intentions
[40:14] that we could have
[40:16] will fail lord when it's not channeled
[40:19] god in that proper channel so lord we
[40:22] would just ask tonight that
[40:24] you would just help us lord dear god the
[40:27] desire that
[40:28] we would have lord it's found in you
[40:31] we desire that you would be lifted up
[40:33] here tonight
[40:35] lord that you would take lord the words
[40:38] the inspiration of the thought lord that
[40:40] you've placed upon my heart
[40:42] and then lord that you would be the
[40:44] visible one
[40:45] right here among us lord god that you
[40:48] would visit lord every heart whether
[40:50] they're here whether they be streaming
[40:51] or
[40:52] we'll archive this service at another at
[40:54] another time
[40:56] lord i pray tonight knowing that your
[40:58] word has no boundaries oh god
[41:01] lord you're not restricted so lord in
[41:03] our hearts
[41:04] we're not going to restrict you we're
[41:06] not going to set any limitations we're
[41:08] just asking that god that you'll come
[41:11] lord by your spirit tonight through your
[41:12] word that you would speak to us in a
[41:14] real personal way
[41:16] lord i pray that you'll just lord take
[41:18] control now lord
[41:20] minister lord to our hearts we pray
[41:23] and we ask it all lord in the name of
[41:25] jesus christ
[41:27] amen amen god bless you as you turn with
[41:30] me to the book of jeremiah chapter 23
[41:33] amen like to say i
[41:34] certainly welcome my uh my aunts here
[41:37] with me
[41:38] um certainly my my mom's sisters and
[41:42] uh my barbara my aunt marcel it's just
[41:44] really good to have them here
[41:46] and um they're they're visiting here
[41:48] with us just for a few days and
[41:50] it's the first time i i have i've seen
[41:52] them they just got in i think today
[41:54] and so we're just so glad to have them
[41:57] here with us and
[41:58] good glad to have each and every one of
[42:00] you amen
[42:02] i just want to look at a little
[42:04] something here that
[42:05] that the lord just really just seemed to
[42:08] really inspire to my heart and
[42:10] just look to him that he will bring it
[42:13] we've been looking at the thought here
[42:15] on on prophets and
[42:16] this will go around right along with it
[42:18] but i i i just this seems to be a focus
[42:21] that god
[42:22] would inspire us here to to look at here
[42:24] tonight
[42:26] so we're not off of that but yet in one
[42:28] way we're just looking at a thought here
[42:31] tonight out of verse 33
[42:33] and when this people or the prophet
[42:36] or a priest shall ask thee
[42:40] say what is the burden of the lord
[42:45] thou shalt then say unto them what
[42:47] burden
[42:49] and i will even forsake you saith the
[42:52] lord
[42:53] and as for the prophet and the priest
[42:55] and the people
[42:56] that shall say the burden of the lord i
[42:59] will even
[43:00] punish that man and his house
[43:03] thus shall you say every one to his
[43:06] neighbor and everyone to his brother
[43:07] what hath the lord answered and what
[43:10] hath the lord spoken
[43:12] and the burden of the lord shall you
[43:14] mention no more
[43:16] for every man's word shall be his burden
[43:20] for ye have perverted the words of the
[43:22] living god
[43:23] of the lord of hosts our god now
[43:25] remember they still
[43:27] had the law they still had all the
[43:30] traditions
[43:31] they still had what they thought was the
[43:34] word of the lord
[43:36] but remember as we've been looking at
[43:38] you can have the bible
[43:40] and not have the word of the lord the
[43:42] word of the lord
[43:43] comes to the prophets
[43:46] is that right and then it comes to that
[43:49] of of the believers now verse 37
[43:51] thus shalt thou say to the prophet what
[43:54] hath the lord answered thee
[43:56] and what hath the lord spoken but since
[43:59] ye
[44:00] say the burden of the lord therefore
[44:02] thus saith the lord
[44:03] because you say this word the burden of
[44:06] the lord
[44:06] and i have sent unto you saying you
[44:08] shall not say
[44:10] the burden of the lord therefore
[44:13] behold i even i will utterly forget you
[44:16] and i will forsake you and the city that
[44:19] i gave
[44:20] that i gave you and your fathers and
[44:22] cast you out of
[44:23] and cast you out of my presence and i
[44:26] will bring an everlasting reproach upon
[44:28] you
[44:28] and a perpetual shame which shall not
[44:31] be forgotten i'd like to come back to
[44:35] that that verse of scripture in verse 33
[44:37] and this is the thought i'd just like to
[44:39] look at out of here tonight
[44:41] what burden what burden
[44:45] may god bless the word and bless you as
[44:48] you're being seated tonight
[44:51] you're familiar if you're not
[44:54] perhaps you will be even as we go along
[44:57] in the service
[44:59] every time that god would visit
[45:03] his people and he would come and reveal
[45:06] his word
[45:08] to his prophets he would be that that
[45:10] man
[45:11] it was not something that he had he had
[45:13] within himself
[45:15] um a desire or was it a self-will or was
[45:18] it a self-made or
[45:20] made by any man but as a matter of fact
[45:22] every time that god
[45:24] would come to deal with his children
[45:26] it's because they had got
[45:28] out of line with the word of the lord
[45:31] and so god would send his word and
[45:34] reveal his word
[45:35] to it to his prophets and we find that
[45:37] there were major prophets before
[45:40] uh that of you know the junction of
[45:42] israel being dispersed and taken away
[45:44] we find as we've been looking at that a
[45:46] prophet is twofold it's a sign of
[45:48] judgment
[45:49] and it's also a sign of deliverance it
[45:52] just depends on
[45:53] your attitude and your approach to it
[45:55] and we find that when
[45:57] the word of the lord would come you find
[45:59] in the scriptures in the book of amos
[46:01] world say
[46:02] what it would say the burden of the word
[46:04] of the lord that had come to amos
[46:06] in the beginning of the book of malachi
[46:08] verse 1 he would talk about
[46:10] the burden of the word of the lord and
[46:12] when you look at the word burden there
[46:14] are many things that if i would even
[46:16] just to express that word to you tonight
[46:18] there is not one of us in here that
[46:20] would uh
[46:21] readily uh uh maybe think of the word
[46:24] burden
[46:25] in a positive way we would think of that
[46:28] as a load as a bearing
[46:30] as a weight as something that we in
[46:32] ourselves would
[46:33] not desire to do at all but yet
[46:37] when we when we look at the burden of
[46:39] the lord
[46:40] we recognize that it is not something
[46:43] that is going to be or
[46:45] trying to be nor is god dependent upon
[46:48] the self
[46:49] strength of man but god is simply
[46:52] depending on a yielded vessel
[46:54] that that burden that god has might be
[46:57] delivered
[46:58] to his people but god's burden now i
[47:01] want you to stay with me now
[47:02] the burden of the lord is not meant to
[47:05] be
[47:05] a weight it is not meant to be alone
[47:09] this word burden is meant to be a
[47:12] tribute
[47:13] or an uplifting you find that in this
[47:16] time there were
[47:17] prophets with uh priests and different
[47:20] ones
[47:20] and they in the time when judgment was
[47:23] coming
[47:24] they were prophesying to that of israel
[47:27] and saying peace and peace you find that
[47:29] with hananiah and the rest of them
[47:32] and and and remember how the spirit of
[47:34] god would say
[47:35] these individuals were not prophesying
[47:38] under the leadership of the holy spirit
[47:40] they were prophesying according to their
[47:43] own vain
[47:44] spirit in other words they did not have
[47:46] a seed of
[47:47] life that where they were ministering
[47:50] that would actually bring about
[47:52] a real reflection within a heart and
[47:54] life to consider
[47:55] where they're at you know deception is
[47:58] one of the worst things in the world
[48:00] because deception can cause a person to
[48:02] actually
[48:03] believe and to think and to feel that
[48:06] they are right when they're actually in
[48:08] the wrong
[48:08] the bible says there is a way that
[48:10] seemeth right
[48:11] unto man but the end thereof notice the
[48:14] end not just
[48:15] what we see or we feel right now but the
[48:18] end thereof
[48:19] are the ways of death the one thing we
[48:21] find always about the word of the lord
[48:24] when god comes to deal with our life we
[48:26] we recognize
[48:27] that the scriptures itself it takes the
[48:30] inspiration of the holy spirit
[48:32] to actually give sight or a vision to
[48:35] that of the word
[48:36] and when the holy spirit gets a hold of
[48:38] the word he not only will show us
[48:40] where we are where we're lacking but he
[48:43] will also
[48:43] show unto us where we are to go
[48:46] and yet if it was just us looking at
[48:49] that in our own
[48:50] humanness we would faint but we
[48:52] recognize the god
[48:54] that is coming and showing us where we
[48:56] are
[48:57] and showing us where we are to be it is
[49:00] the same god by inspiration
[49:02] that is able and will translate us from
[49:05] this place to where we ought to be so it
[49:08] all
[49:09] has to be a work of him that he would
[49:12] lift up our souls he would actually
[49:15] bring to our lives that
[49:18] that increase and the desire that he's
[49:21] calling for
[49:22] so when i look at this thought tonight
[49:25] and i think of that in the scripture
[49:27] what burden
[49:28] and and i think of that in terms of you
[49:31] know when
[49:32] these prophets were prophesying they
[49:35] were coming
[49:36] and they were uh coming in a manner as
[49:38] though that they
[49:39] were bearing the tribute or the
[49:42] uplifting of the soul
[49:43] that was quite quite the contrary their
[49:45] ministry
[49:46] was not lifting up the soul it was not
[49:49] removing
[49:50] sin it was not removing the condition of
[49:52] the people
[49:53] it wasn't checking them at all but on
[49:56] the contrary
[49:57] it was only telling them peace peace you
[49:59] know god loves you
[50:01] just continue on how you are you're the
[50:03] ancient city jerusalem
[50:05] you're the children of israel but what
[50:07] it is they had drifted from the word
[50:09] so these men were not packing the burden
[50:12] of the word of the lord but there was
[50:14] a burden that they were packing it was a
[50:17] burden that would add to the burden
[50:19] of bondage that the people were already
[50:21] under but aren't you glad that god comes
[50:24] god does not come to add upon the burden
[50:27] that is already there
[50:28] upon our life that we are born with but
[50:31] god comes to relieve that burden
[50:33] and release a real uplifting in our life
[50:36] that we can come back into the original
[50:39] state
[50:39] that god intended for you and i to be as
[50:42] sons and daughters of god
[50:44] now so when we look at this you know
[50:46] many times uh you know a person will
[50:49] look
[50:49] upon living a christian life as a burden
[50:53] but we recognize that when it looks to
[50:55] be burdensome
[50:57] that is because there's a heart that
[50:59] doesn't want to obey
[51:01] the voice of god they would rather hold
[51:03] to their own way
[51:05] and instead instead they are referring
[51:07] to god's way
[51:09] of mercy as a burden but the lord
[51:12] you know to them he's burdensome to them
[51:14] you know it's quite a contrast
[51:16] because you can take to some people they
[51:18] look at serving the lord
[51:20] that's what they have to give up and i
[51:21] got to stop this and i got to quit that
[51:24] but yet then when god deals with another
[51:26] heart you find that there are things
[51:27] that they just readily let go as god
[51:30] begins to deal with their life
[51:32] so with that same response it comes back
[51:34] to
[51:35] when a person can say oh my that burden
[51:38] of the lord
[51:38] but when god deals with your heart you
[51:41] begin to look at it and say
[51:42] what burden what is it that god is
[51:44] asking of me
[51:45] that's too great for me to release and
[51:48] give up what compares
[51:50] to him what burden so when we look at
[51:54] this we find
[51:55] even clear back there in the garden of
[51:57] eden you know when satan came there
[51:59] within that
[52:00] of the serpent as an upright beast he
[52:02] walked up there to
[52:04] eve and remember he presented to eve
[52:07] a gospel remember paul would pick this
[52:09] up how that satan would try
[52:11] to corrupt the simplicity of the true
[52:14] atonement
[52:14] of the gospel itself but yet how satan
[52:17] would
[52:18] come there and he would you know move in
[52:20] such a measure
[52:21] to tell eve god's keeping something back
[52:24] from you
[52:25] god is holding something back from you
[52:27] and yet there were things that god
[52:29] was keeping from her he was keeping
[52:32] death
[52:32] he was keeping sickness he was keeping
[52:35] sin
[52:35] he was keeping all those things from her
[52:38] but remember how satan began to move in
[52:41] at this particular time he presented it
[52:44] to her
[52:45] in a way as though you're under bondage
[52:48] you're bound up there's a burden upon
[52:50] your life
[52:51] but yet she was as free as free could be
[52:54] but you see it's how satan was putting a
[52:57] spin
[52:57] on the word in that hour he was taking
[53:00] what god
[53:01] had given to be protection and instead
[53:04] putting a spin on it
[53:05] that would cause her to want to forsake
[53:07] that word and to reach out
[53:09] beyond that i'll tell you what satan was
[53:11] really wanting to do
[53:12] he was not wanting to relieve her burden
[53:15] he was desiring to bring her
[53:17] into bondage and because of that fall
[53:20] remember
[53:21] now here you and i are in the midst of
[53:23] this situation
[53:24] there's not a person here of in this
[53:26] building or streaming or whatever
[53:28] we were not born righteous it doesn't
[53:30] matter if you had two holy ghost-filled
[53:32] parents
[53:33] we were born in sin shaping and iniquity
[53:36] we came to the world speaking lies
[53:38] as job said that a man born of a woman
[53:40] is a few days old
[53:42] and full of trouble this is why our
[53:44] first birth
[53:45] is corruption but that's why there had
[53:48] to be a way
[53:49] that we might be born again not entering
[53:52] into our mother's womb
[53:54] the second time but that there would be
[53:56] the spirit of life
[53:58] that would come to you and i that would
[54:00] actually be able
[54:02] to deal with the burden that was upon
[54:04] our life
[54:05] that would be actually able to lift that
[54:08] soul that was crying out for life to be
[54:12] able to
[54:12] lift it into the realms and the presence
[54:15] of the very righteousness of almighty
[54:18] god
[54:19] it would take almighty god himself
[54:21] coming to do that
[54:23] think of cain now when you look at cain
[54:25] here this product
[54:27] of this and how it came forth and we
[54:29] find that cain you know
[54:31] you find him you never find anybody that
[54:34] even would stand even satan himself
[54:36] that would even stand in the presence of
[54:38] god and spit god's word
[54:40] right back in his face remember here god
[54:44] reveals himself to abel abel does not
[54:46] know the correct offering to bring
[54:48] but remember god reveals to abel that
[54:51] there must be a lamb so what does it
[54:53] mean
[54:54] there was blood that took them out there
[54:56] in the eden
[54:57] so there must be blood life in order for
[55:00] them to enter back in and worship
[55:02] the bible says that abel retain obtained
[55:05] a witness whereby but he was
[55:07] righteous and when he offered that
[55:09] sacrifice now cain
[55:10] is beholding this from a farm now he's
[55:13] right there
[55:14] he's worshiping he's got his fruits his
[55:16] vegetables
[55:17] this guy is not a smart alec he has
[55:20] brought the very
[55:21] best to god he has brought you know he
[55:23] didn't bring out some of these
[55:24] vegetables they try to sell out to the
[55:26] market he didn't bring things with brown
[55:28] spots and
[55:29] all wilted and everything else this guy
[55:31] brought the very best
[55:33] now you and i would look at that and say
[55:35] oh my what a wonderful guy well you know
[55:38] cain no doubt
[55:38] he was a very wonderful guy remember
[55:41] when you look at esau and jacob
[55:43] esau was a much better man than jacob
[55:46] jacob was a saster
[55:47] he was a subplanter he was he was a
[55:49] deceiver i ain't talking about israel
[55:51] i'm talking about jacob when i'm talking
[55:53] about you i ain't talking about that
[55:55] first verse jacob
[55:56] i'm talking about that hidden one down
[55:58] on the inside
[56:00] that real israel that real seed germ of
[56:03] god
[56:03] that all it took is to get in the
[56:05] presence of almighty god
[56:07] and the very one that the promises were
[56:10] to
[56:10] becomes illuminated in that place
[56:15] cain sees this vindication there
[56:18] is no vindication on cain's altar
[56:25] he gets mad i've done all this
[56:28] everything i've done for you god look
[56:32] how i've labored
[56:33] look what i've done but you see
[56:37] his laboring never brought
[56:40] the presence of god cain could outwork
[56:44] abel 100 to 1 million to one
[56:47] but it's not about works according to
[56:49] our own abilities
[56:51] it's about being available and being
[56:53] open that god would speak to us that we
[56:56] can offer
[56:57] what god has provided for us to offer
[57:00] but cain despised that
[57:02] that vindication of the very presence of
[57:05] god
[57:05] coming there upon the altar and
[57:07] receiving able sacrifice and then
[57:10] you find how that cain would go on you
[57:12] know within that time
[57:13] he never humbled himself but instead
[57:16] when god look how god offers mercy to
[57:18] cain
[57:19] the mercy of god to cain would never
[57:21] change cain from being king
[57:23] but god said if you will worship as your
[57:26] brother does
[57:27] i'll accept you you see it those of god
[57:30] his mercy would reach out to it but cain
[57:33] cain would not accept that at all
[57:35] and instead we recognize that how it
[57:36] come that cain eventually
[57:38] he rose up against abel and he slew him
[57:42] and we find that within that and within
[57:45] that aspect of it
[57:46] we find that how that when god met him
[57:49] he came
[57:50] and he began to look and he tells cain
[57:52] the voice
[57:53] of your brother it cried from the ground
[57:57] and remember as soon as cain comes face
[57:59] to face once again
[58:01] with god he begins to just flatly come
[58:03] out and say
[58:04] who am i am i my brother's keeper watch
[58:07] his attitude
[58:08] toward the word that's searching him out
[58:11] the word is giving him
[58:13] mercy in order for the burden to be
[58:16] relieved but instead of receiving mercy
[58:19] cain has an attitude against the mercy
[58:22] of god
[58:24] now watch watch what takes place here
[58:26] when cain
[58:27] he asks when god you know unfolds
[58:30] how he knows what has taken place and
[58:32] then he begins to express
[58:34] all of this to cain remember what cain
[58:37] had said
[58:38] oh you lay on me a burden too great i
[58:40] can't bear this burden
[58:41] you lay on me too much oh my any man
[58:44] that sees me he'll want to kill me you
[58:45] know
[58:46] what you read in that whole verse it has
[58:49] nothing about a man or a lord we could
[58:51] say an individual
[58:52] that is actually seeking after the mercy
[58:55] of god
[58:56] it's simply all about them
[59:01] it has nothing to do with the mercy of
[59:04] god
[59:04] friends that's one of the sure signs
[59:06] that the mercy of god
[59:07] will pull away and is rejected is when
[59:10] there begins to be
[59:12] excuses and that of a person will try to
[59:15] stand against that let me just say this
[59:16] to you
[59:17] every one of us here even before those
[59:20] of us
[59:20] who were born again of the spirit of god
[59:22] it's the first nature that god
[59:24] had to come and deal with to where
[59:27] eventually
[59:27] we ourselves had a desire there was god
[59:31] moving in our hearts to where we got
[59:34] sick and tired
[59:35] of being ourselves we desired a real
[59:38] deliverance
[59:39] in our lives no doubt many of us we
[59:42] tried to reform ourselves
[59:43] we tried to do certain things and we
[59:45] found out self-reformation
[59:47] the fruits and works of man's hands will
[59:50] never bring the power of god
[59:52] down into a life but it takes accepting
[59:55] god's
[59:56] provided lamb his provided way and that
[1:00:00] brings down the spirit of almighty god
[1:00:04] so what burden when we look at this
[1:00:07] because you find within cain
[1:00:09] cain's worship had nothing to do with
[1:00:12] with that you know
[1:00:14] with with with self-surrender his his
[1:00:17] worship
[1:00:17] is will-worship you realize that's where
[1:00:21] many are at today
[1:00:22] it's will worship it's their own
[1:00:26] will into it now you might look at it
[1:00:28] and say well shouldn't we have our own
[1:00:30] will yeah you do have your own will
[1:00:32] god does not take from you your own will
[1:00:34] remember even with the lord jesus
[1:00:36] he has gone god came here in flesh in
[1:00:39] order to redeem us
[1:00:40] he never removed that will but that will
[1:00:43] was there but it was a will that was
[1:00:44] surrendered to the will of god
[1:00:46] because god himself will not pull us god
[1:00:49] himself will not push us
[1:00:50] he comes to lead us and he comes to lead
[1:00:54] us
[1:00:55] into a place of self-surrender so it's
[1:00:57] not
[1:00:58] will worship but it actually becomes
[1:01:00] self-will
[1:01:02] that surrendered to god's will now
[1:01:04] brother brown would pick this up here
[1:01:06] and i'm just just feeling pressed here
[1:01:08] in the message of how
[1:01:10] can overcome and he's dealing with this
[1:01:12] ladies and age that we're living in
[1:01:14] and we recognize that the condition of
[1:01:16] time that we're living in
[1:01:18] is a condition that when we read in
[1:01:20] revelations 3 they have put
[1:01:22] god on the outside of the church now
[1:01:24] they still have the bible
[1:01:25] still have rituals to have traditions
[1:01:27] still have all that but remember
[1:01:29] they put him on the outside of the
[1:01:31] church
[1:01:32] they will not allow him to be god in the
[1:01:35] lives of the people
[1:01:37] and in the lives of of his word
[1:01:40] and to project that word instead what
[1:01:42] has put him out creeds dogmats
[1:01:44] traditions all those ismans has put him
[1:01:47] out
[1:01:47] because remember it is him that comes to
[1:01:50] perform
[1:01:51] his word now in every age it goes to say
[1:01:54] for each one of those ages
[1:01:56] in there in the book of revelations he
[1:01:57] that overcometh it's personal
[1:02:00] it's not a group collective revelation
[1:02:02] it's not
[1:02:03] a group overcoming you know you can look
[1:02:06] at somebody else mom dad
[1:02:08] pastor whomever more and you can look at
[1:02:10] their life and see the overcoming
[1:02:12] but yet it's got to be your personal
[1:02:14] overcoming that's god's desire
[1:02:16] that you would have a personal
[1:02:18] overcoming in your own life that's why
[1:02:21] it is spoken he that overcometh
[1:02:24] now you find within this of the spirit
[1:02:26] of this age remember
[1:02:27] ladies what does it mean it means
[1:02:30] people's rights
[1:02:31] and we find that we're living right here
[1:02:33] in that characteristic of time
[1:02:35] where people are desiring of their own
[1:02:38] rights what a paradox it is
[1:02:40] that god would be calling a bride like
[1:02:42] esther
[1:02:43] that is willing to forsake her own
[1:02:45] rights
[1:02:47] a being able by the grace of god to
[1:02:49] forsake and say well i want this and i
[1:02:51] want that and i want this and i want
[1:02:53] that
[1:02:53] i'm going to take this to meet the king
[1:02:55] but instead esther she did not take
[1:02:57] and what she thought the king would like
[1:03:00] she looked at haggai
[1:03:01] the king's chamberlain and said you know
[1:03:03] the king you're his right-hand man
[1:03:06] what does the king delight in glory be
[1:03:09] to god
[1:03:10] though millennials see an age as an age
[1:03:12] you remember that
[1:03:13] on the it has such a stern rebuke to it
[1:03:17] because
[1:03:17] it's an age that will not take
[1:03:19] correction it's an age
[1:03:21] that needs to be correct corrected and
[1:03:24] so
[1:03:24] we recognize that within it it's a place
[1:03:27] to where
[1:03:28] the spirit of this age the attitude is
[1:03:30] i'm rich
[1:03:31] and i have need of nothing
[1:03:34] oh my but what a blessing it is what a
[1:03:36] blessed people you are tonight
[1:03:38] if you're able to say lord i need you
[1:03:41] i need you lord i need you more now than
[1:03:44] i ever needed you before
[1:03:47] now notice brother graham will take this
[1:03:48] this example here
[1:03:50] when he's when he's going to lay in on
[1:03:52] this message on how can i overcome
[1:03:54] he says i was crossing an old log the
[1:03:56] other day and it was you know out in a
[1:03:58] hollow
[1:03:59] and i'll i jumped on this log and oh
[1:04:01] outside
[1:04:02] it looked good looked like a big old
[1:04:06] beach log
[1:04:06] but when i jumped on it a great chunk of
[1:04:09] it fell off
[1:04:10] it was real rotten and dirty i said
[1:04:13] that's the way that christians are
[1:04:15] becoming
[1:04:16] do you catch what he said on the outside
[1:04:18] this log
[1:04:20] looked good
[1:04:23] i mean it looked just right
[1:04:26] it looked like it had strength but as
[1:04:29] soon as some
[1:04:30] weight got on it it couldn't hold that
[1:04:33] weight
[1:04:35] a chunk of it just gave way he says now
[1:04:38] that's the way christians are becoming
[1:04:40] they've been dead
[1:04:42] in sin and trespasses so long till they
[1:04:44] become doty
[1:04:45] they can hold no weight at all they
[1:04:47] don't know what overcoming means
[1:04:50] overcome now listen to this keep life
[1:04:53] in you when life went out that's what
[1:04:56] brought that log
[1:04:57] to that condition it made it worse than
[1:05:00] ever
[1:05:01] when it laid in the branch where the
[1:05:03] water was now think about it
[1:05:05] that tree needed water
[1:05:08] but the wave that it was just laying in
[1:05:11] the water
[1:05:12] was actually a great detriment to it
[1:05:16] that tree was meant to be planted and
[1:05:19] the roots would actually
[1:05:21] take from the water source instead the
[1:05:24] very water
[1:05:25] that was actually meant to bring
[1:05:27] refreshment
[1:05:28] that that that the very vital places and
[1:05:31] parts
[1:05:31] of that tree could be sustained and life
[1:05:34] could continue to come forth but because
[1:05:36] it now had moved from an upright
[1:05:38] position
[1:05:39] to a laying down position that was
[1:05:42] laying in the very source
[1:05:44] of what would be life but it did not
[1:05:47] have itself
[1:05:48] tapped in to receive what it needed to
[1:05:50] receive
[1:05:52] so it matters this is where it comes
[1:05:53] down to it matters even as we're
[1:05:55] gathering right here
[1:05:57] under the ministering of the word it
[1:05:59] matters we don't want to just be people
[1:06:01] who lay around
[1:06:02] we want to be people who are planted we
[1:06:05] want to be people who are drinking
[1:06:07] in and taking of the word of the lord
[1:06:09] not just laying around where it's at and
[1:06:11] say oh my
[1:06:12] praise god i felt really good today my
[1:06:15] that was a wonderful service today
[1:06:17] but the question is did it change you
[1:06:19] did the spirit of god
[1:06:21] cause you to reflect deeper has it moved
[1:06:23] deeper within your life
[1:06:25] we do not want to be lazy doty
[1:06:28] christians overcoming is to keep life in
[1:06:33] us now notice he says
[1:06:34] you take a christian that's supposed to
[1:06:36] be a christian you let the life of god
[1:06:38] go from him
[1:06:39] and the experience and the joy of
[1:06:42] serving christ
[1:06:43] and living in a church where such is
[1:06:45] going on he rottens
[1:06:47] twice as quick living right under it
[1:06:50] if we're trying to follow the message of
[1:06:52] the hour or at least this
[1:06:54] part of the message we should live
[1:06:56] constantly
[1:06:57] in the life of christ now brother is
[1:06:59] telling us here as he's bringing this on
[1:07:01] even as a life is in journey
[1:07:04] to receive the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:07:07] it's to live
[1:07:08] constantly in his life all right
[1:07:11] and then once that life has been sealed
[1:07:14] we know that the book of jude
[1:07:16] in jude there it would say building up
[1:07:19] your most
[1:07:20] holy faith praying in the holy ghost
[1:07:24] so there's a constant growth a constant
[1:07:27] growing within a life let me just say
[1:07:28] this to you
[1:07:29] there's a person here there's not one of
[1:07:31] us here that aren't have not those
[1:07:33] that have been born again of the spirit
[1:07:35] of god there's not one of you
[1:07:37] including myself that could raise their
[1:07:39] hand and say well i ain't never been
[1:07:40] cold that's a lie there's been times
[1:07:42] where we've got cold
[1:07:43] there's been times where the cares of
[1:07:45] life and things have encroached
[1:07:47] upon our life but you recognize that god
[1:07:49] in his mercy
[1:07:50] will move right back into our life and
[1:07:52] say hey you gotta keep on drinking
[1:07:55] you got to keep on drawing from the
[1:07:56] source you know what it is
[1:07:58] you don't feel right if you're not
[1:07:59] feeding on the right things of god
[1:08:02] you feel like something's missing why do
[1:08:04] i feel the way i do
[1:08:05] because you were meant to feed on the
[1:08:08] word of
[1:08:08] almighty god you were meant to drink of
[1:08:12] the spirit of god man
[1:08:13] shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:08:16] every word that proceeds
[1:08:18] from the mouth of god so thank god for
[1:08:20] his mercy
[1:08:24] yeah that's true because sometimes we
[1:08:26] can just get careless and say well
[1:08:27] you know i've heard that before and i've
[1:08:29] heard that before and really when we get
[1:08:31] to looking at that and god deals with
[1:08:32] our heart lord why didn't i even where
[1:08:34] did that attitude come
[1:08:35] there's still that part that's about you
[1:08:37] carnal and sticky
[1:08:38] but thanks be to god greater is he
[1:08:40] that's in you
[1:08:41] than he that's in the world oh glory be
[1:08:45] to god now watch here
[1:08:46] he says because if you don't and you lay
[1:08:49] around and you know what things you're
[1:08:50] supposed to do and you don't do it
[1:08:52] he that knoweth to do good and doeth it
[1:08:54] not to him it's sin
[1:08:55] then you become doty rotten when you're
[1:08:58] separated from the life of god
[1:09:00] so strive with all that's in you did you
[1:09:02] catch that word
[1:09:04] strive
[1:09:09] it's just the easiest thing in the world
[1:09:11] to become a christian you haven't read
[1:09:12] your bible
[1:09:14] i don't know who's presented to you that
[1:09:15] that you know the bible says that
[1:09:17] narrow and straight is the way but broad
[1:09:20] is the way
[1:09:21] that leadeth to destruction the bible
[1:09:24] says
[1:09:25] that since the time of john the kingdom
[1:09:27] of god suffereth violence
[1:09:29] and the violence take it by force as
[1:09:32] soon as god
[1:09:33] begins to deal with a heart and move
[1:09:36] upon a life
[1:09:37] satan begins to fight and begins to come
[1:09:40] and begins to attack that life from the
[1:09:42] mind to all
[1:09:43] other things around it it will take a
[1:09:46] fight but let me tell you
[1:09:47] it look at who's fighting with you the
[1:09:50] bible said if god
[1:09:51] be for us who can be against us
[1:09:55] if god is speaking his word to your
[1:09:58] heart
[1:09:58] god is on your side
[1:10:02] hallelujah so strive with all that's in
[1:10:05] you
[1:10:06] to stay in the life of christ that you
[1:10:08] would be
[1:10:09] fruit bearing now this age it's a
[1:10:12] grandest of all age give me a little bit
[1:10:14] more up here
[1:10:15] the grandest of all age but it's also
[1:10:19] the most deceptive
[1:10:22] this age is the most deceptive age since
[1:10:25] the garden of eden
[1:10:30] it's a time where it comes back into
[1:10:33] that time right there
[1:10:34] just as god is calling his bride
[1:10:38] that god himself has been building and
[1:10:41] bringing forth that bride
[1:10:43] in this hour uh it's the same time
[1:10:47] that satan is bringing forth his
[1:10:49] intellectual bride
[1:10:51] right now remember when we when we
[1:10:55] look at this here this great age of
[1:10:58] deception
[1:10:59] this deception it's so close your
[1:11:01] brother brown would say it like this
[1:11:03] that people
[1:11:03] can so live a clean holy life not be
[1:11:06] sinful
[1:11:07] adulterers drinkers liars gamblers and
[1:11:10] they can live above all that
[1:11:11] and still not with it this is the age of
[1:11:14] the personal
[1:11:15] life of jesus christ remember the
[1:11:18] parallel
[1:11:19] think about it now where we're living
[1:11:20] when the lord jesus came
[1:11:22] here upon this earth there were men that
[1:11:25] he
[1:11:26] was standing face to face with that
[1:11:28] lived a holy life
[1:11:31] are you with me they lived above
[1:11:32] adultery they lived above drinking
[1:11:34] they lived above smoking they lived
[1:11:36] above that matter of fact you couldn't
[1:11:38] put a finger
[1:11:39] on their lives come on now
[1:11:42] but when the word came in that hour he
[1:11:44] wasn't just looking on the outside of
[1:11:46] that log
[1:11:47] that word began to deal with their life
[1:11:50] and
[1:11:50] chunks of their life was falling away
[1:11:54] and here the word made flesh said you're
[1:11:57] full of dead men's bones
[1:11:59] what was it he went looking at their
[1:12:01] vestige their person
[1:12:03] he was identified the spirit that was in
[1:12:06] them
[1:12:07] is the same spirit that killed the
[1:12:09] prophets
[1:12:10] it stoned them and was stood down as a
[1:12:13] matter of fact
[1:12:13] they were uncircumcised in their heart
[1:12:19] you see god looketh on the heart i'm
[1:12:22] glad for that aren't you
[1:12:24] thank you if it would have been
[1:12:27] uplifting the outer man
[1:12:29] nobody had a chance peter would have
[1:12:31] been out andrew had been out
[1:12:32] simon had been out all the rest of him
[1:12:34] been out legion would call them
[1:12:36] legion of demons he'd have been out too
[1:12:38] the woman who was bowed
[1:12:39] living with the seventh mind come on now
[1:12:41] they would all bent out as a matter of
[1:12:43] fact we remember when jesus came to
[1:12:44] simon's house
[1:12:46] remember they were they invited him
[1:12:47] there to make fun of him but there was
[1:12:49] an appointment
[1:12:50] he was coming to keep it was not an
[1:12:52] appointment with simon
[1:12:53] but he knew that little lady she was
[1:12:55] going to come and she was going to
[1:12:56] anoint him for her burial
[1:12:58] i'm telling you the spirit of god was
[1:13:00] moving and orchestrating and lining all
[1:13:03] those parts up at that time
[1:13:04] it was the outcast of society it was
[1:13:07] those that were looked down upon
[1:13:09] if anybody would have thought that these
[1:13:12] men should have been the ones
[1:13:13] that would have been able to bear the
[1:13:15] burden of the lord but they weren't able
[1:13:16] to bear it
[1:13:17] when the word called to them they
[1:13:19] refused it they said what a burden
[1:13:21] look what we'll have to give up we'll
[1:13:23] have to give up our churches
[1:13:24] we'll have to give up the sanhedrin
[1:13:27] we'll have to give this
[1:13:28] up listen even when the young boy
[1:13:31] who received eyes not just his eyesight
[1:13:34] he received eyes
[1:13:35] when they brought him back there to his
[1:13:38] parents and remember he told them who
[1:13:40] healed him
[1:13:41] and they asked the parents and the
[1:13:42] parents for fear
[1:13:44] of the rulers of the synagogue they said
[1:13:47] you you ask him
[1:13:48] he's of age the word actually brought a
[1:13:52] separation
[1:13:53] in that family because of what god
[1:13:57] had done to one's eyes it actually
[1:14:00] brought a separation
[1:14:02] but brother it didn't matter what his
[1:14:04] mama and papa thought
[1:14:05] he had had a real experience with the
[1:14:08] living god
[1:14:09] in his life and brother he was united
[1:14:12] with that
[1:14:14] burden we're talking somebody never
[1:14:16] could see
[1:14:21] [Music]
[1:14:22] we're talking about somebody didn't have
[1:14:24] eyes
[1:14:26] that's right
[1:14:29] you see this is where jesus would say
[1:14:33] blessed are they which do hunger and
[1:14:36] thirst
[1:14:37] after righteousness for they shall be
[1:14:38] filled you realize it's a blessing to
[1:14:41] even want the holy
[1:14:42] ghost you realize that
[1:14:45] because there's many people in this
[1:14:46] world they don't want it i don't need
[1:14:48] that
[1:14:49] what the word is calling them to they
[1:14:51] look at that and say that's going to
[1:14:52] cram my lifestyle
[1:14:54] that's going to cut in on my life i
[1:14:57] can't do this and i can't do that so you
[1:14:59] know what they do
[1:15:00] they find the church that'll let them do
[1:15:01] it because they have a desire to be
[1:15:05] religious cain wasn't an infidel
[1:15:08] that boy was religious he was a
[1:15:12] worshiper come on somebody he did not
[1:15:15] come there to clown he came to worship
[1:15:18] amen you see they'll find something
[1:15:21] that's much like a filter it will allow
[1:15:23] so much of the world to go through
[1:15:27] oh but when there's hearts i said lord i
[1:15:30] just want you
[1:15:32] i don't care what i have to give up i
[1:15:35] don't care what it is
[1:15:36] how you deal with my life i want you
[1:15:38] lord
[1:15:40] you're the one that i want more than
[1:15:41] anything i don't want to appease my
[1:15:44] spirit
[1:15:44] i don't want to appease my mind i don't
[1:15:46] want to try to dead
[1:15:48] something right now but i want the full
[1:15:50] reality
[1:15:51] that i can enjoy the full blessing and
[1:15:53] the full benefit
[1:15:54] the joys of the lord right now i want a
[1:15:57] real release
[1:15:58] within my own life
[1:16:00] [Music]
[1:16:04] now notice where jesus would say here in
[1:16:07] john 14 22
[1:16:09] many of these simple simple parts is
[1:16:11] where the enemy wants to
[1:16:13] move a person beyond jesus said unto him
[1:16:16] not to scare it lord
[1:16:17] how is it that thou wilt manifest
[1:16:19] thyself unto us and not unto the world
[1:16:22] and jesus answered and said unto him if
[1:16:24] a man love
[1:16:25] me he will keep my word so first you
[1:16:28] have to recognize it's him
[1:16:31] if you recognize it's him you recognize
[1:16:33] it's his word
[1:16:34] he will keep my words if he loves me and
[1:16:37] my father
[1:16:38] will love him and we will come unto him
[1:16:42] and make our abode with him now notice
[1:16:45] this is the promise if he loves me and
[1:16:48] he keeps my word
[1:16:50] we will come and make our abode we know
[1:16:52] it's not two different people it's the
[1:16:54] one and the same
[1:16:55] we will make our abode in him now abode
[1:16:58] is not like something like you know that
[1:17:00] brother bill i went to your house and
[1:17:01] you know i visited your house the other
[1:17:02] day and we
[1:17:03] you know planted that tree and things
[1:17:04] like that and then i left that was not
[1:17:06] my boat that's not where i stayed that's
[1:17:08] not where i sleep
[1:17:09] that's not where i eat i just came there
[1:17:10] and visited now some of your other
[1:17:12] houses maybe i visited or
[1:17:13] you visited my house or just like my
[1:17:15] aunts right now they're up here you know
[1:17:17] from maryland from west virginia this is
[1:17:19] not their abode
[1:17:20] this is not where they live but where
[1:17:22] they live is their abode
[1:17:23] and you recognize that god his desire is
[1:17:26] not just to be something
[1:17:28] that comes upon a life and the life gets
[1:17:30] excited oh it's wonderful
[1:17:31] to be excited in his presence but god
[1:17:34] wants to make
[1:17:35] your life an actual abode
[1:17:39] he wants to make his residency
[1:17:42] inside of your life you might say my
[1:17:45] life
[1:17:45] oh god certainly you don't know what my
[1:17:47] life is remember
[1:17:48] he could have been born in the most
[1:17:50] beautiful of palaces
[1:17:52] he could have set up in the greatest
[1:17:54] place upon this earth
[1:17:56] but instead he came in such humility
[1:17:59] when he went to the end the end said we
[1:18:01] don't got no rooms for you here
[1:18:03] but there was a little stinky dirty
[1:18:07] stable there was a place that was not
[1:18:10] even
[1:18:10] fit for the king of glory to be birthed
[1:18:14] in
[1:18:14] but god was showing that i will come
[1:18:17] into lies
[1:18:18] that will love me and make room for me
[1:18:21] it might be outcast by the world it
[1:18:24] might be rotten lies and cast down
[1:18:27] but when those lives make way for me i
[1:18:30] will come
[1:18:31] and i will birth my glory into their
[1:18:35] [Music]
[1:18:38] lives
[1:18:42] he that loveth me not keepeth not
[1:18:46] my sayings and the word which you hear
[1:18:50] is not mine but the fathers which send
[1:18:53] me
[1:18:54] now notice in first john 5.
[1:18:58] in first john chapter 5 verse 3
[1:19:02] for this is the love of god notice how
[1:19:05] john
[1:19:06] would write this definitively this
[1:19:10] is the love of god that we
[1:19:13] keep his commandments
[1:19:16] and his commandments are not grievous
[1:19:20] now here's the real paradox in it is
[1:19:22] that
[1:19:23] when we the love of god it's the love of
[1:19:26] god from our heart
[1:19:28] doing what we do because we love him
[1:19:31] this is what this is the love of god
[1:19:33] it's not keeping the commandments
[1:19:34] because oh my
[1:19:35] if i don't if i man if i go in there
[1:19:36] like this brother samuel is going to
[1:19:38] tear me up
[1:19:39] if i do that man oh my lord have mercy
[1:19:41] and look around the store i wonder who's
[1:19:43] here you know i
[1:19:44] i'm not dressed exactly right it don't
[1:19:46] matter listen to me right now listen to
[1:19:47] me very carefully
[1:19:48] you can be right in your home and
[1:19:50] there's nobody there but your husband
[1:19:52] and your kids i hear the prophet of god
[1:19:54] tell us over and over he said you
[1:19:56] shouldn't even dress like that in your
[1:19:57] own house
[1:19:59] praise brother samuel you see because
[1:20:02] remember the eyes of the lord
[1:20:04] are always to and fro you see here's
[1:20:06] what happens
[1:20:07] what you do in your house you get
[1:20:09] careless in your house it'll follow you
[1:20:11] out your door
[1:20:12] you get careless in your house it'll
[1:20:13] follow you right in here come on now
[1:20:15] that's why sometimes people can't
[1:20:17] understand why this embarrasses me
[1:20:19] and that embarrasses me it depends what
[1:20:21] you allow in your home
[1:20:22] will come out and follow with you we
[1:20:25] don't want to be people you know
[1:20:26] i wouldn't want my kids saying oh my
[1:20:28] goodness now now i'm leaving the house
[1:20:30] god man i got gotta act different now i
[1:20:32] gotta change and act different no no
[1:20:33] i don't wanna confuse them you see this
[1:20:35] is what babylon is
[1:20:37] confusion it doesn't allow the real
[1:20:40] children of god
[1:20:41] to be able to act according to god's
[1:20:43] discipline but god wants you and i this
[1:20:46] is what the real working
[1:20:47] of the spirit of god does in our life it
[1:20:50] brings us to a place
[1:20:51] it doesn't matter if it's monday if it's
[1:20:53] tuesday wednesday
[1:20:54] thursday on and on it don't matter if
[1:20:56] we're in the house of god
[1:20:58] we're outside of the house of god it
[1:20:59] don't matter if we're with believers
[1:21:01] or we're working in the midst of
[1:21:02] unbelievers we're still
[1:21:05] a christian
[1:21:08] come on somebody daniel
[1:21:11] lived a victorious life and daniel
[1:21:14] didn't even have the holy ghost
[1:21:18] he lived an overcoming life right in the
[1:21:20] midst of babylon
[1:21:23] it's not about where god puts you it's
[1:21:25] about if god has put you in a certain
[1:21:27] place
[1:21:27] remember if god has put you there his
[1:21:30] grace will keep you
[1:21:31] he will let him cause his light to shine
[1:21:34] through your life as a testimony it
[1:21:36] won't just be a testimony to others but
[1:21:38] god will display
[1:21:40] the keeping and the holding power of his
[1:21:42] divine nature
[1:21:43] through your life
[1:21:46] this is the love of god what that we
[1:21:49] keep his
[1:21:50] commandments and his commandments are
[1:21:53] not grievous you see
[1:21:54] if it's not the love of god on the
[1:21:56] inside keeping them
[1:21:57] then they're grievous
[1:22:01] why this i don't think that's necessary
[1:22:05] anymore
[1:22:06] ah god don't care about that that's that
[1:22:09] old whispering-lying devil
[1:22:12] he came right there in the evening and
[1:22:14] talked to god's daughter
[1:22:16] oh god really don't care you know god
[1:22:19] just loved you that sounds like a dodie
[1:22:21] grandpa
[1:22:22] you know there's things that my dad let
[1:22:24] my boys get by with and matter of fact
[1:22:25] he'd tell my mom now don't you tell
[1:22:27] samuel
[1:22:28] don't you i find out about this later
[1:22:29] don't you tell samuel when i'd get on
[1:22:31] him and i told him if you were there in
[1:22:33] your pants you and i are going to have a
[1:22:34] meeting afterwards there
[1:22:35] you're not going in your pants over here
[1:22:37] and then following all the bathroom
[1:22:38] rules at our house
[1:22:40] of course that ain't how old they are
[1:22:41] now i mean this was when they were much
[1:22:43] younger you know
[1:22:44] obviously and you know my dad popped up
[1:22:46] at that time i didn't know about this
[1:22:48] until later until you know after they
[1:22:49] had won a lot of victories in that area
[1:22:51] that my dad had told my mom the one time
[1:22:53] he said you get them clothes off that
[1:22:54] boy you get them in there in the washer
[1:22:56] and you wash them up and don't you let
[1:22:57] samuel know
[1:22:58] what happened right here
[1:23:01] how times change i wouldn't have been
[1:23:04] going to the washington washington
[1:23:06] washroom i'd have been going to the
[1:23:07] woodshed
[1:23:08] i'd have been getting tanned for going
[1:23:09] you know in my pants or something like
[1:23:10] that
[1:23:11] but you see god it's not called dodie
[1:23:13] grandpas
[1:23:15] god does not call grandchildren are you
[1:23:17] with me now the bible tells us in
[1:23:19] hebrews chapter 12
[1:23:21] that it is the church of the firstborn
[1:23:23] and that firstborn
[1:23:25] is that which that life that is hidden
[1:23:27] as a son and daughter of god
[1:23:29] on the inside god himself he does not
[1:23:31] become a grandfather
[1:23:32] but every time he reveals himself into
[1:23:35] that generation
[1:23:36] he reveals himself to be the same in the
[1:23:39] same power
[1:23:40] in the same characteristic just as he
[1:23:42] revealed himself
[1:23:43] to isaac he said i'm the god of thy
[1:23:46] father abraham
[1:23:47] when he revealed himself to jacob he
[1:23:49] never said i'm the god of your
[1:23:51] grandfather abraham
[1:23:52] he said i'm the god of your father
[1:23:55] abraham
[1:23:56] showing up that no matter how time goes
[1:23:59] time can increase but he's still the
[1:24:01] same god
[1:24:02] with the same power and the same essence
[1:24:05] and the same nature
[1:24:06] and the same characteristic weren't you
[1:24:09] glad for that tonight
[1:24:11] hallelujah it's not a different
[1:24:14] experience
[1:24:15] than what peter and them had on the day
[1:24:17] of pentecost
[1:24:18] it's the same original outpouring of the
[1:24:21] holy ghost
[1:24:22] that brings a transformation
[1:24:24] [Applause]
[1:24:28] this is the difference his commandments
[1:24:30] are not grievous
[1:24:33] now remember
[1:24:37] when paul when god revealed himself to
[1:24:40] paul
[1:24:41] remember god used peter the bible
[1:24:45] paul would write about this in the book
[1:24:46] of galatians we see it in the book of
[1:24:47] acts
[1:24:48] that god wrought mightily effectually to
[1:24:51] minister to the circumcision
[1:24:53] through peter but paul
[1:24:56] was a messenger the first messenger the
[1:24:59] prophet
[1:25:00] to the gentiles he was ordained and
[1:25:03] chosen by god to bear
[1:25:05] the light of the gospel unto the
[1:25:07] gentiles the
[1:25:08] bearing of the very name of almighty god
[1:25:12] paul was committed with that of the word
[1:25:15] that god had entrusted remember peter
[1:25:17] was not committed
[1:25:18] to bring that balance between law and
[1:25:19] grace remember peter and himself even
[1:25:22] though he was there the one day
[1:25:23] eating barbecue ribs and you're eating
[1:25:25] bacon and peter's like man alive
[1:25:27] what i've been missing out on this pork
[1:25:28] but all of a sudden when some brethren
[1:25:30] came over the
[1:25:30] over the you know the hill peter said
[1:25:32] quick get the listener and help me get
[1:25:33] this stuff off my
[1:25:34] bacon grease off my hands hear the
[1:25:36] brethren come what are they gonna fake
[1:25:38] you see
[1:25:38] peter was swayed but paul said no no no
[1:25:40] this is liberty
[1:25:42] paul was able to bring the
[1:25:45] dividing of law and grace you see that
[1:25:48] was not something that paul was in his
[1:25:50] efforts trying to do
[1:25:52] it was something that god had gifted him
[1:25:55] it was the grace of god that would catch
[1:25:57] him
[1:25:57] into that place now i say all of that to
[1:26:00] say this because
[1:26:01] when we look at in the scriptures
[1:26:03] there's a lot of times there's debates
[1:26:04] about paul well paul was an old woman
[1:26:06] hater and paul was this and paul was at
[1:26:08] i'll tell you what every one of those
[1:26:10] every one of those types of statements
[1:26:11] and things like that
[1:26:12] those are individuals that when they
[1:26:14] look at paul and they want to downplay
[1:26:16] paul i'll tell you what they need
[1:26:17] they need the same kind of upper room
[1:26:18] experience that paul had
[1:26:20] they need to meet the same god that paul
[1:26:22] had because what paul wrote here under
[1:26:24] inspiration of the spirit of god he
[1:26:27] wrote in verse 36 of first corinthians
[1:26:29] 14
[1:26:29] what came the word of god out from you
[1:26:31] or came in unto you only
[1:26:34] if any man thank himself to be a prophet
[1:26:37] or spiritual notice he brings it on down
[1:26:40] from just a prophet meaning that of a
[1:26:42] preacher or anyone there
[1:26:44] or a spiritual spirit-filled believer
[1:26:47] anybody
[1:26:47] who would regard himself in this measure
[1:26:50] let him acknowledge
[1:26:52] that the things that i write unto you
[1:26:55] are the commandments of the lord
[1:27:00] amen well i can recognize jesus but i
[1:27:03] can't recognize paul then you really
[1:27:05] don't recognize jesus
[1:27:06] because if you recognize jesus you'd
[1:27:08] recognize christ leading paul
[1:27:10] because paul said follow me as i follow
[1:27:11] christ is that right but if any man be
[1:27:14] ignorant let him be ignorant
[1:27:20] now notice we look at this law versus
[1:27:23] a love affair let me just try to
[1:27:26] maybe to try to try to bring this down
[1:27:28] here a law versus a love affair
[1:27:31] quite it's quite a quite quite a big
[1:27:33] difference
[1:27:34] a law versus a love affair
[1:27:38] you know a law is something where you
[1:27:41] uh you're having to do it and hit
[1:27:43] inwardly there's something that's
[1:27:45] absolutely against it
[1:27:48] brother and we picked this up very very
[1:27:50] simple expression in the message all the
[1:27:52] days of our life
[1:27:54] and he talks about a season more
[1:27:56] probably probably most of you and i
[1:27:57] especially
[1:27:58] probably from this area know what linton
[1:28:00] is i'm not talking about the stuff from
[1:28:01] the dryer i'm talking about
[1:28:02] linton the linton season you know
[1:28:06] where it's a lenten season you know and
[1:28:08] i'll be in also honest with you now i
[1:28:09] was raised in a city
[1:28:10] where there was a catholic school i had
[1:28:12] friends and went to catholic school
[1:28:14] and i remember when i sat down there at
[1:28:15] the uh i just got done working out for
[1:28:17] football's down to marietta and i came
[1:28:19] in there that day and
[1:28:20] i'm sitting down getting ready to eat
[1:28:22] man i'm just hungry and i look up and i
[1:28:24] start seeing all these girls come in
[1:28:27] and i looked at the first one and i saw
[1:28:28] this dirt
[1:28:31] i thought dear lord surely she don't
[1:28:33] know she got dirt on her forehead
[1:28:35] i've never seen that before never seen
[1:28:38] it
[1:28:40] never seen it then another one came i
[1:28:42] thought oh dear lord
[1:28:46] i seen another one come out i thought
[1:28:48] this is too easy boy it's gonna be too
[1:28:49] easy poking fun at they got dirt all
[1:28:51] over where they've been doing
[1:28:54] then little did i know what was taking
[1:28:57] place that was
[1:28:58] ash wednesday this is when it starts to
[1:29:01] linton season
[1:29:02] there was a boy
[1:29:06] that guy was a big old guy
[1:29:13] you know he would come around the
[1:29:14] hallway he'd come down into my room
[1:29:17] and this guy always walked around with a
[1:29:18] two liter of pepsi
[1:29:22] always
[1:29:24] but when it came to that time of the
[1:29:25] season i can't remember why i called him
[1:29:27] lurch i said lurch
[1:29:28] where in the world where's your two
[1:29:30] liter pepsi at buddy
[1:29:33] i gave that up for lent i said
[1:29:37] say that again he said i gave that up
[1:29:39] for lynn
[1:29:41] i said what's that mean he said well
[1:29:44] and he told me you know how many days it
[1:29:46] was you know and i'm just as ignorant as
[1:29:48] can be
[1:29:49] so he tells me about and i said so you
[1:29:52] mean you just gave it up
[1:29:53] and then after that period of time
[1:29:54] you're going to pick that back up
[1:29:57] yeah now what i found was
[1:30:01] different guys would go to give up
[1:30:03] different things some gave up pepsi
[1:30:05] others gave up sardines the real cheap
[1:30:07] ones gave up stuff they didn't even like
[1:30:11] and i find all these guys one guy likes
[1:30:13] oreos who gives oreos up and
[1:30:14] the other guy likes video games he gave
[1:30:16] up video games and all this other stuff
[1:30:18] like that
[1:30:20] now you know what it was it was a season
[1:30:24] that would come about that would cause
[1:30:27] people
[1:30:28] to get very religious
[1:30:33] and when that season came around they
[1:30:36] entered into that season but they could
[1:30:40] not
[1:30:40] wait until then 45 46 how many days it
[1:30:45] was
[1:30:45] they couldn't wait they were waiting man
[1:30:48] i mean in 11
[1:30:49] 50 they were counting down 10 minutes to
[1:30:51] pepsi 10 minutes to penn state
[1:30:54] nine minutes to pepsi eight minutes to
[1:30:56] oreos
[1:30:57] seven minutes to video games they were
[1:30:59] waiting
[1:31:00] until they themselves could be free
[1:31:04] from that burden they were under
[1:31:08] that's the truth they would go right
[1:31:11] back to it now let me bring it down the
[1:31:13] spiritual
[1:31:14] you can take a person to say i'm going
[1:31:16] to stop smoking cigarettes
[1:31:18] that's a good thing because it'll kill
[1:31:20] you
[1:31:22] i'm going to stop wearing makeup that's
[1:31:24] a good thing because not only is it
[1:31:26] despised in the eyes of god
[1:31:28] but it also has carcinogens in it that
[1:31:30] brings cancer to your body
[1:31:33] but there's something much deeper than
[1:31:35] that it because if it only goes to that
[1:31:38] level
[1:31:38] and it never makes it to a place that
[1:31:41] the inward desire
[1:31:42] is dealt with after so long in time
[1:31:46] the pepsi will come back the makeup will
[1:31:48] come to come on somebody
[1:31:49] the cigarettes will come back the less
[1:31:51] problem will come back
[1:31:52] the pornography problem will come back
[1:31:54] it'll come back
[1:31:56] if it's never dealt with
[1:32:01] it's not lenten season that we need to
[1:32:03] get caught up in amen
[1:32:05] it's the season of the word
[1:32:08] it's when he is passing by our way
[1:32:13] like that one who was waiting by the
[1:32:16] pool of siloam
[1:32:17] why are you here for i'm waiting for the
[1:32:19] angel to come down and trouble the water
[1:32:21] why because soon whoever steps in there
[1:32:24] first is going to receive what they have
[1:32:27] need of
[1:32:29] he was waiting for that certain season
[1:32:31] you see god troubles the water
[1:32:33] god moves upon our life he deals with
[1:32:37] our hearts
[1:32:37] that lets us know this is the acceptable
[1:32:40] time
[1:32:41] these are not just mere things that you
[1:32:43] have to say lord well you know i'll stop
[1:32:45] doing this
[1:32:45] i'll stop doing that but say it like
[1:32:47] this say lord this is what you're
[1:32:49] calling me to
[1:32:50] lord take it out of my life
[1:32:56] what will he do he will actually lift
[1:33:00] the burden
[1:33:07] somebody look at you and say you're
[1:33:08] still going to that church
[1:33:11] you're still yeah
[1:33:15] what a burden and you say
[1:33:18] what burden
[1:33:27] god's asked me to give this up because
[1:33:29] it displeases him
[1:33:31] it's not according to his nature i want
[1:33:33] to reflect as a daughter of god i want
[1:33:35] to reflect as a son of god you see what
[1:33:37] it is
[1:33:37] it's god bringing out the desire the
[1:33:39] delight within your life
[1:33:41] there's not one sister one lady here
[1:33:44] within this building god put it in you
[1:33:46] you want to look beautiful
[1:33:47] you want to look nice that's a god-given
[1:33:49] attribute
[1:33:50] that is not of the devil but the devil
[1:33:52] wants to take that
[1:33:54] and try to make and present as though
[1:33:56] well this has to be
[1:33:57] you know you got these blemishes you got
[1:33:59] this and you got that god never tells
[1:34:01] you that
[1:34:02] but god himself there will be a beauty
[1:34:04] yes sure you do your hair
[1:34:05] sure you wear your your nice dresses and
[1:34:08] things that are loose fitting and
[1:34:09] brothers you know the same way but them
[1:34:11] but the sisters
[1:34:12] there's a desire within you that wants
[1:34:14] to look beautiful
[1:34:15] that is a god-given desire but don't
[1:34:19] allow the devil to dress you
[1:34:21] allow god to address you because when
[1:34:24] god dresses you
[1:34:26] he veils you with his word
[1:34:32] and then the gold the goods is all
[1:34:35] covered and concealed
[1:34:38] and with me i might have seen awful
[1:34:41] flattening off a plane but you
[1:34:42] understand god
[1:34:43] intends for his children to be veiled
[1:34:47] god doesn't want his daughters like
[1:34:49] billboards
[1:34:52] advertising no no god wants his glory
[1:34:56] to be the diadem that's on our head
[1:35:00] to be adorned as the bible says in a
[1:35:02] meek
[1:35:03] and quiet spirit a meek spirit one who
[1:35:06] gives
[1:35:07] place to him
[1:35:13] let me read this closely
[1:35:17] i believe that christian life is a
[1:35:20] continual
[1:35:21] sacrifice it's not just
[1:35:25] 45 days out of the year 30 days out of
[1:35:29] the year
[1:35:30] you see this is the problem many times
[1:35:32] it's because it only goes to a certain
[1:35:34] amount of time
[1:35:36] and it's your strength that you're
[1:35:38] trying to hold on to i'm not just
[1:35:39] preaching here i'm preaching to those on
[1:35:41] the internet as well
[1:35:43] this is why our strength the bible even
[1:35:45] tells us in the book of isaiah chapter
[1:35:47] 40 that even a young man you know a
[1:35:48] young man young lady
[1:35:49] they have a lot of strength a lot of
[1:35:51] zeal but it says even the young men's
[1:35:53] strength
[1:35:54] will fail you you don't have the
[1:35:57] strength that's needed
[1:35:58] to stand against the tight the tide and
[1:36:00] the wickedness
[1:36:01] of the enemy but you let god come behind
[1:36:05] you you yield your strength to god and
[1:36:07] say lord
[1:36:08] be my strength lord i yield my life to
[1:36:11] you you know what it invites him
[1:36:13] to come and to back up that confession
[1:36:16] and that stand that you're making for
[1:36:17] him
[1:36:18] because this is what he said he said you
[1:36:19] stand for me here on earth i'll stand
[1:36:21] for you in heaven
[1:36:24] notice this i believe a christian life
[1:36:25] is a continual sacrifice
[1:36:28] remember jesus said whosoever will come
[1:36:29] after me let him
[1:36:31] deny himself daily
[1:36:34] take up his cross and follow me it's a
[1:36:36] continual
[1:36:37] win oh he said how the christian loves
[1:36:39] to do it he doesn't do it with the
[1:36:41] grudge
[1:36:41] he don't do it with a feeling that he
[1:36:44] does it with the feeling that he loves
[1:36:45] god he's glad to do it listen this
[1:36:47] it's a joy to serve the lord jesus it's
[1:36:50] a joy to sacrifice it's a joy to worship
[1:36:53] the lord
[1:36:54] it's a joy to be called a fanatic for
[1:36:56] the kingdom of god's sake
[1:36:58] it's a joy to take a stand for the right
[1:37:00] and move from the wrong
[1:37:02] it's joy to praise him it's joy to
[1:37:05] abstain from the things of the world
[1:37:06] it's in their heart it's a perfect
[1:37:09] lenten
[1:37:10] all the time god's spirit comes in you
[1:37:13] and changes your desire
[1:37:26] what do i do keep life in you
[1:37:31] keep life in you keep walking
[1:37:34] on with god as god is dealing with your
[1:37:38] heart remember this is not a
[1:37:39] relationship between me and you
[1:37:40] this is a relationship between you and
[1:37:43] your heavenly father
[1:37:45] he's the one who speaks to you he's the
[1:37:47] one who calls to you
[1:37:49] i cannot in myself lift that burden i
[1:37:51] cannot lift the burden from around your
[1:37:53] life
[1:37:54] but he's the one he said i'll be your
[1:37:56] burden bearer
[1:37:57] he's the one that can actually lift that
[1:38:00] burden in your life
[1:38:01] to where how god will begin to deal with
[1:38:03] the heart that maybe you know at one
[1:38:05] time
[1:38:05] i think about when god you know when i
[1:38:07] hired a young person and you know i'd
[1:38:09] look at it and say oh my
[1:38:10] got to go to church again man oh man
[1:38:14] i'll tell you goodness i mean the
[1:38:16] preacher gets up there and preaches an
[1:38:17] hour and a half and two hours
[1:38:19] dad gets up behind it and recites for 45
[1:38:21] minutes and goes through this and then
[1:38:23] they sing songs after song and
[1:38:25] this brother is going to get up and sing
[1:38:26] this song and this song now come on now
[1:38:29] see what was that in the natural part
[1:38:32] there was a part within it yeah i was
[1:38:34] coming
[1:38:34] but my heart wasn't in it
[1:38:38] it was a law i did things i wonder who's
[1:38:40] watching i wonder who's looking around
[1:38:42] i hope nobody's watching but one thing
[1:38:44] about it god is always watching
[1:38:46] i never was able to escape from him
[1:38:49] god knew exactly where i was but oh i'm
[1:38:52] so glad
[1:38:53] i'm so glad that it's not something that
[1:38:56] i have to do
[1:38:57] it's something i get to do i don't have
[1:39:00] to serve god
[1:39:02] i love to serve the lord it's not a
[1:39:05] burden to serve him
[1:39:07] it is my delight
[1:39:14] let's pray heavenly father
[1:39:20] we just lord are so thankful
[1:39:24] so thankful lord for your mercy so
[1:39:27] grateful lord tonight that we know you
[1:39:30] as one lord jesus who comes
[1:39:34] with the burden of the lord to lift that
[1:39:38] burden lord from about our life to
[1:39:41] separate us from that old sin nature
[1:39:45] oh god to come down lord with the
[1:39:48] circumcising power
[1:39:50] of the word of god and lord jesus to
[1:39:53] deal with our life
[1:39:54] lord jesus it is truly a love affair
[1:39:58] you've never threatened us you never
[1:40:00] threatened me lord
[1:40:01] you never came at me and and brought
[1:40:03] threats lord god
[1:40:05] i don't serve you tonight out of fear of
[1:40:07] going to hell
[1:40:08] i don't do that lord i can remember lord
[1:40:11] god before you got a hold of my life
[1:40:13] oh my lord i'd get so scared when the
[1:40:16] power of god would come in services
[1:40:18] i'd get so fearful lord i'd watch people
[1:40:21] lord god
[1:40:22] right here in this church not per se
[1:40:23] this building in that other little
[1:40:25] building we were renting lord
[1:40:26] where there'd be different ones get
[1:40:27] right up out of wheelchairs and walk
[1:40:29] lord that had never walked
[1:40:31] i'd see and sense the power of god and i
[1:40:33] would thank the thought would range
[1:40:35] in my heart at that time oh god the
[1:40:37] rapture is going to be on and i'm not
[1:40:39] ready
[1:40:41] that was fearful
[1:40:43] [Music]
[1:40:45] i did things out of fear
[1:40:49] but lord i'm so glad
[1:40:52] i'm so glad
[1:40:55] that there's a welcoming to your
[1:40:57] presence
[1:40:58] [Music]
[1:41:00] i'm a part of this rapture lord there's
[1:41:04] always a reverence
[1:41:06] when you come
[1:41:09] [Music]
[1:41:11] lord jesus i pray if there's one that's
[1:41:15] here tonight let them know
[1:41:17] i believe you already have i believe you
[1:41:18] already have you've let them know
[1:41:22] that lord jesus you don't come to add to
[1:41:25] their burdens
[1:41:26] no no you came
[1:41:29] and you come to relieve their burdens
[1:41:34] because the real burden is us trying to
[1:41:37] do it
[1:41:39] for our own will now lord
[1:41:43] may they see the simplicity of it if
[1:41:44] there's be one here tonight
[1:41:48] that it's surrendering their will
[1:41:52] to you like a little boy putting on a
[1:41:55] coat he can get one arm in there
[1:41:58] but he'll spin around and around and
[1:42:00] around and around trying to get his
[1:42:02] other arm
[1:42:03] in that coat but if he can just put his
[1:42:06] hand
[1:42:07] in the hand of his parent
[1:42:10] his parent will guide his hand into the
[1:42:13] other
[1:42:14] sleeve that coat that he's got part way
[1:42:17] on
[1:42:18] will become a fully
[1:42:21] clothed child
[1:42:24] or granite tonight i pray that lord for
[1:42:28] every heart
[1:42:31] may they walk within that lord keeping
[1:42:34] life in them
[1:42:35] may it be the desire within their life
[1:42:37] for those lord i
[1:42:38] i thank god of even in these services
[1:42:40] and not just a few people
[1:42:42] you've been dealing with all of our
[1:42:43] lives the lord god
[1:42:46] may each and everyone continue to keep
[1:42:49] life in them
[1:42:51] may they strive may we strive
[1:42:54] with all that's in us to live constantly
[1:42:59] in the life of christ
[1:43:02] granted lord we don't want to be soft
[1:43:06] and dirty
[1:43:08] we don't want to look good on the
[1:43:09] outside where we've got everything on
[1:43:11] the outside
[1:43:12] right on no no we want to have it on the
[1:43:15] inside
[1:43:17] right on because when we've got it on
[1:43:19] the inside
[1:43:20] right on it'll reflect on the outside
[1:43:24] when temptations come when pressures
[1:43:27] come
[1:43:28] when afflictions come when persecution
[1:43:30] comes
[1:43:31] when reproach comes there's a strength
[1:43:35] that's within us lord
[1:43:39] lord jesus how we thank you tonight
[1:43:44] thank you lord because from our heart
[1:43:48] where the rest of the world others
[1:43:51] lord i know i can fellowship many lord
[1:43:54] that if

[1:43:56] their friends and different ones would
