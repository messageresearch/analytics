[40:39] furnace of

[43:32] me to Ruth chapter 2 God bless you it's
[43:34] good to have you too sir good to have
[43:38] you Brian Brian just this just just a
[43:44] tad just thank
[43:50] you uh Ruth chapter
[43:55] 2
[44:10] verse one of Ruth chapter two I won't
[44:12] keep you standing I'll just let me read
[44:14] a couple verses and then we'll let you
[44:16] be seated Ruth chapter 2 and verse
[44:19] one and Naomi had a Kinsman of her
[44:23] husbands a mighty man of wealth
[44:26] of the family of IMC and his name was
[44:30] Boaz prise the Lord and Ruth the
[44:34] moabitas said unto
[44:36] Naomi Let Me Now go to the field and
[44:41] glean ears of corn after him in whose
[44:46] sight I shall find
[44:49] Grace and she said unto her go my
[44:54] daughter and it makes may God bless you
[44:56] bless the reading of the word as you're
[44:57] being
[45:02] seated ask you to forgive me last week I
[45:05] realized I didn't even give you the
[45:08] title after we had got done spoken
[45:11] speaking but I know you can always see
[45:13] it in the corner of the screen but just
[45:15] a thought that actually struck my heart
[45:17] and I had no you know you don't know how
[45:20] the Lord's going to take you and you
[45:22] just want to be mindful of
[45:24] that um when we looked at just the
[45:27] thought when it had struck my heart I
[45:29] thought well we'll just the thought will
[45:30] just drop in one service and we'll be
[45:32] going on and uh if that's what the Lord
[45:35] had had and then we seen last week how
[45:38] the Lord just took the service and I
[45:40] just always want him to take it the only
[45:42] thing I want to only thing I want is
[45:44] just Lord help me to get out of the way
[45:46] amen and just have let him take it
[45:48] because he knows what we have need of
[45:51] and uh you know surprises sometimes can
[45:54] uh can can get us you know but uh those
[45:57] are good surprises uh how the Lord just
[45:59] moves in such a way and uh so when we
[46:04] look at this here uh you know in the
[46:06] scripture I want to just really focus in
[46:08] on that once again on the value of
[46:12] obedience because many times the the way
[46:15] that remember Paul would address it to
[46:17] the Corinthian Church of how that uh
[46:20] that Satan had wanted to corrupt the
[46:24] Simplicity that is in Christ Christ and
[46:27] the the enemy is in in many ways there's
[46:30] ways if he cannot push you one way he'll
[46:34] try to push you another way if he can't
[46:37] make you to a place to where you say Ah
[46:39] that's not necessary then he would like
[46:42] to put you to a place to where you could
[46:44] go off to one extreme and then at the
[46:47] same time if if the enemy sees that well
[46:50] you know you're you're not going to get
[46:53] you're not getting rid of him he what
[46:55] he'll try to do is is in one way try to
[46:58] bring confusion in your mind but I'm
[47:00] thankful that the Holy Spirit God is
[47:03] mindful to lead us as his children he's
[47:05] a Shepherd that is one of the attributes
[47:08] of God that is made manifest and a goat
[47:12] cannot be shephered but a but a sheep
[47:15] can and when David said the Lord is my
[47:18] shepherd and I shall not want and we are
[47:22] depending on his leadership and this is
[47:25] where that when we can see this with
[47:27] Ruth that as she stands here in this
[47:30] moment and I want to just really hone in
[47:32] on a part of this in the scriptures this
[47:34] morning how the Lord will take us on
[47:36] staying and serving and that's really
[47:40] just what's been really resonating on my
[47:42] heart for some time here we look here in
[47:45] in this of the scripture that Ruth
[47:47] herself in in returning back with Naomi
[47:52] and here she moves into the field to
[47:54] begin to glean ears of corn and realize
[47:58] that this was you know Naomi's husband
[48:00] had passed away and so had uh Ruth and
[48:03] uh orphas and we've seen orpa did not
[48:05] return the least little discouragement
[48:07] orpa just went on her way but Ruth had
[48:10] had made a decision and it was a
[48:13] clearcut decision it was a decision that
[48:17] I'm going all the way where you Lodge
[48:21] that's where I'm going to Lodge your God
[48:24] shall be my God and there's nothing
[48:26] going to separate me from this except
[48:29] let it be if there's anything at all let
[48:32] it just be that of death if anything
[48:34] anything other than that she was
[48:36] determined and you know let me just say
[48:38] it like this the only way that even as a
[48:41] person that you can even be determined
[48:43] like that is God has spoke to your heart
[48:46] oh yeah Ruth herself being a moabit she
[48:49] she did not even have a promise in the
[48:52] land of Israel but there was something
[48:54] as we were looking looking at that last
[48:56] week that she was being moved by the
[48:59] spirit of God and she couldn't explain
[49:01] it she didn't know exactly why but she
[49:04] was yielding to the spirit of God that
[49:07] was dealing with her life perhaps even
[49:10] Ruth was not even fully aware of all
[49:13] that was being said or spoken from her
[49:16] lips but she was speaking from her heart
[49:20] I want to just read this here once again
[49:22] as you know the prophet would say it
[49:24] like this in the Redeemer and Redemption
[49:26] and I I think we were ending with this
[49:29] last week and he said Ruth was willing
[49:31] to forsake her Idols forsake her past
[49:34] life forsake her people forsake
[49:37] everything and return with Naomi no
[49:40] matter what the circumstances was she
[49:43] was willing to go on that's all that God
[49:46] asks for is
[49:48] willingness there's no greater thing
[49:50] that we can give to God than a heart
[49:53] that is willing and you know it takes
[49:55] God it takes the spirit of God to make
[49:58] and bring about our heart to a place of
[50:01] willingness it's God it's his work it's
[50:04] not it's not man's work it's not it's
[50:06] not our doing it is salvation the Bible
[50:09] says very clearly salvation is of the
[50:12] Lord if we're here today and you have a
[50:15] desire to serve God you're a blessed
[50:18] people and I just say it like this if if
[50:21] if you have that desire don't just keep
[50:24] it but be like the little lad who had a
[50:27] lunch all that lunch could have done is
[50:29] fed him that day but when he surrendered
[50:32] it to the Master's Hand then it fed a
[50:36] 5,000 and that's not even including
[50:39] women and children they weren't even
[50:41] listed in that but afterwards the Bible
[50:44] said there was 12 baskets full and 12
[50:48] represents worship so not only can he
[50:51] take from your life and take that desire
[50:54] he put that desire in you and the God
[50:58] himself is the one to satisfy that
[51:01] desire and with that he will prove
[51:04] himself to be more than enough more than
[51:08] you could have ever imagined he'll prove
[51:10] to be sufficient for every problem for
[51:13] every situation for anything that can
[51:16] ever arise in your life he is more than
[51:22] enough that's so good and when it's all
[51:25] said done it's a life of
[51:28] worship now watch brother B says now the
[51:31] way every man that comes to Christ must
[51:33] first be willing regardless he says I
[51:36] never like to tell the people oh you're
[51:38] going to prosper and be a rich man now
[51:41] that sounds like a Texas religion you
[51:43] know what I'm talking about and God's
[51:46] going to bless you you ain't going to
[51:48] have no sickness I don't promise him
[51:50] that because God don't promise him that
[51:52] the Bible said many are the afflictions
[51:55] of the righteous but let me finish it
[51:58] but the Lord deliver them out of them
[52:02] all is that right in the Book of John
[52:05] chapter 16 he said to his disciples
[52:08] before going to his crucifixion he said
[52:11] in this world you shall have much uh
[52:15] trial tribulation and persecution but in
[52:18] me you shall have peace and be of good
[52:21] sure for I have overcome the world
[52:26] H Hallelujah I don't promise him that
[52:29] because God don't promise that I say if
[52:31] you're really born again in your heart I
[52:33] don't care how rough the road gets
[52:35] you'll still hold on to God's unchanging
[52:37] hand no matter what lays before you if
[52:40] Jesus goes with me I'll go amen long as
[52:44] he goes that's all that's
[52:48] necessary verse three of room of Ruth
[52:51] chapter 2 and she went now I want you to
[52:54] notice this
[52:56] she is moving under the direction of
[53:00] Naomi there there is a need when they
[53:03] come back in the land they have no
[53:07] sustenance but they're in the land or
[53:10] their return back to the land is not
[53:13] only because EMC Naomi's husband has
[53:17] passed Ruth's husband has passed
[53:19] orphan's husband has passed but in the
[53:21] passing then the word comes that there
[53:24] is
[53:25] bread in Israel it's barley season so
[53:31] that in itself how you know listen
[53:33] friends God God's not entrusting you and
[53:36] I to try to arrange everything and make
[53:39] everything fit but God brings every
[53:42] piece and part together in his own time
[53:46] in his own way God will cause every part
[53:49] to come together just exactly at the
[53:53] right
[53:54] time he's not too late he's not going to
[53:56] be too early he's always right on time
[54:00] sometimes we think he's too late or or
[54:02] we're wondering where he's at but
[54:03] remember when he came to raise Lazarus
[54:06] he was right on time when you begin to
[54:09] sense that of where you sense an
[54:11] anxiousness remember that's not of God
[54:15] that is exactly like what brother Brian
[54:17] was ministering there the other time
[54:19] that's only the enemy trying to disturb
[54:21] you there's an oncoming visitation
[54:25] Hallelujah let's stand right there sit
[54:28] right there at that tent door and look
[54:30] for him wait for him he's coming when
[54:33] pressure arises listen that's only Satan
[54:36] trying to distract you and get you away
[54:40] from the real
[54:41] promise let me tell you something Satan
[54:44] will do everything in his power to try
[54:46] to distract
[54:51] you when I drive down the road my wife
[54:54] has to tell me especially when it's well
[54:56] it doesn't matter if it's deer season or
[54:59] not she'll just have to remind me honey
[55:01] honey eyes on the road I look over and
[55:04] say there's something moving in that
[55:05] Woods over oh my look at that field over
[55:07] there my look at that body on that deer
[55:09] honey honey honey honey eyes on the road
[55:11] I said just my peripheral honey just my
[55:14] peripheral but you you know and I know
[55:16] just like when we have the things what
[55:18] they call the no texting laws which
[55:20] everybody pays attention
[55:23] to we've seen the video I remember when
[55:25] the young people years ago showed me
[55:27] videos uh I think maybe even eight years
[55:29] ago just people that were texting and
[55:31] then here they were driving a big SUV
[55:34] and it just it's just in dust after
[55:37] because they were texting and they
[55:38] crossed the median it only takes one
[55:40] moment of distraction and Satan knows
[55:44] that in our life
[55:46] spiritually listen let me just say let
[55:48] me just be very honest he knows certain
[55:50] things that'll push your buttons and
[55:52] pull your strings and let me just say
[55:55] this the buttons and the strings are not
[55:58] righteous they're not of God they come
[56:00] along from that first birth but Satan
[56:03] his objective is to try to distract us
[56:08] from what we need to be focused on that
[56:11] ought to tell you one thing that Satan
[56:13] is afraid of you getting a hold of the
[56:17] word and the word getting a hold of your
[56:19] life yes sir that's right I'm telling
[56:22] you doomed devils are on the Run Satan
[56:24] is nervous
[56:28] let's just keep him
[56:31] nervous notice the Bible says she went
[56:34] and came and gleaned in the field after
[56:35] the Reapers she's instructed by Naomi
[56:39] here she is she's going out into the
[56:40] field listen they just didn't come into
[56:43] Israel and then they're just uh you know
[56:46] sitting in their house and saying well
[56:47] you know if it's if it's God's will to
[56:50] you know Lord I you just you just drop
[56:52] whatever I need Lord you just but she
[56:54] had notice she's going out in obedience
[56:57] to the word that God had given even
[57:00] throughout the Old Testament Ruth being
[57:02] a type of the Gentile bride she goes out
[57:05] together she's going out to glean and
[57:09] and she's going she's going to have to
[57:10] glean after those of the Reapers and
[57:13] even after the maidens that will bind
[57:15] that of the uh of the barley and of the
[57:19] Harvest and she will have to go and
[57:21] glean that and beat it out and so forth
[57:23] but notice the Bible says
[57:25] and her hap was to light on a part of
[57:28] the field belonging unto baz who was of
[57:32] the Kindred of
[57:33] AMC I wish I had a lot of time to speak
[57:36] on just these two words her haap because
[57:39] her haap this is not a chance it says
[57:42] her ha this means her lot she wasn't
[57:46] aware listen she made her decision but
[57:49] you see the value of simple obedience
[57:52] God will Direct you in the pathway of
[57:57] his
[57:59] Blessing God this wasn't it wasn't
[58:01] something that just you know just fly by
[58:04] night she's going according to the word
[58:06] she's going out to glean and God sees to
[58:10] it to guide her to this part of the
[58:13] field why did she choose this part of
[58:16] the field that belonged to baz she
[58:19] didn't know it belonged to
[58:22] Boaz she didn't know that let me just
[58:24] say this to you this is all the field of
[58:27] God's
[58:28] promise this is this this is God's field
[58:31] it's fied with promises but who is it
[58:35] that guided you to the point of the
[58:38] field in this hour where the promise of
[58:41] God was to be made manifest not a
[58:44] promise of 2,000 years ago not a promise
[58:47] of even 50 years ago but a promise for
[58:50] right now because the Bible said I'm God
[58:53] and I change not and Jesus Christ is the
[58:56] same yesterday today and
[58:59] forever a living God a living reality
[59:03] you're not here by
[59:05] chance you're here by
[59:10] Design right in the field of God's
[59:13] choosing God knows
[59:16] exactly that's why nowhere to go but the
[59:19] Holy Spirit has come and led us into the
[59:22] promises for this hour the same go God
[59:24] that leads us in the promise of this
[59:26] hour lead you through all of your
[59:28] future he'll lead you through every
[59:31] aspect of your life cuz he's he's
[59:33] concerned about everything he's a God
[59:37] that he said you seek me seek me first
[59:40] seek you first the kingdom of God and
[59:42] his righteousness and all these other
[59:44] things the whole of life is consumed or
[59:48] encompassed in all these other things
[59:51] shall be added to
[59:53] you
[59:55] praise Boaz the Bible said in verse four
[59:58] came from Bethlehem and said unto the
[1:00:00] Reapers the Lord be with you oh I love
[1:00:04] that and where did Boaz come from
[1:00:05] Bethlehem the house of God's
[1:00:08] bread and he says notice his
[1:00:10] announcement as he descends the Lord be
[1:00:13] with you all right that's good and they
[1:00:16] answered him the Lord bless thee then
[1:00:20] said Boaz unto his servant notice he
[1:00:23] comes to one specific for the age and
[1:00:27] baz said unto his servant that was s
[1:00:29] over the
[1:00:32] Reapers is that right in the right hand
[1:00:34] of God the Bible says in the Book of
[1:00:36] Revelations are seven stars and the
[1:00:39] Seven Stars Are The Messengers to the
[1:00:43] seven Church
[1:00:45] ages right each one of those ages is was
[1:00:48] God dealing with a gentile the Bible
[1:00:51] said we're living until the fullness of
[1:00:54] time be fulfilled the fullness of times
[1:00:56] is God working and calling out a gentile
[1:01:00] bride where the Jews rejected it they
[1:01:03] listen it was prophesied they would be
[1:01:05] blinded but if they hadn't been blinded
[1:01:07] come on we're in the Book of Romans if
[1:01:09] God had not blinded them you and I would
[1:01:12] not have had a chance that's right but
[1:01:15] God God he blinded them that he might
[1:01:18] want what was laying in the scripture
[1:01:21] all through the Old Testament that I
[1:01:23] will take a PE I will SW unto me a
[1:01:26] people for my name's sake and God would
[1:01:29] take a people unto himself like Joseph
[1:01:32] took a gentile
[1:01:34] bride Ruth is a gentile it's speaking of
[1:01:38] this hour that's why this book Even This
[1:01:41] Book of Ruth is not just a small little
[1:01:45] book but the Book of Ruth in his hand
[1:01:49] was a little book
[1:01:52] open four chapters four Earthly
[1:01:56] Deliverance four is messengers of life
[1:01:59] where Satan has taken life from the
[1:02:01] church four Messengers restored to its
[1:02:05] original
[1:02:07] Glory Hallelujah the four
[1:02:11] anointings of the lion stepping forth
[1:02:15] that Ezekiel Saw Isaiah saw John saw
[1:02:18] here stands the lion here stands the ox
[1:02:21] here stands the man here stands this the
[1:02:24] the the Eagle what is it the same spirit
[1:02:26] of God moving through the
[1:02:31] characteristics in his in his hand a
[1:02:33] little book open and he descended who
[1:02:37] did he give this little book to he
[1:02:39] revealed it he tore off the seals and
[1:02:42] sent it down to his seventh angel
[1:02:43] Messenger on
[1:02:48] Earth sometimes I like to we just have
[1:02:51] to Coast was he lets us Coast in some of
[1:02:53] those things I I don't want to just say
[1:02:55] I want to make sure that we're all
[1:02:59] together my don't you love the Lord
[1:03:02] listen friends the Bible the Bible is is
[1:03:05] not just a
[1:03:06] book it's a history and it's a book of
[1:03:10] Prophecy it's a living
[1:03:13] reality of Jesus Christ all the way
[1:03:16] through Jehovah of the old is Jesus of
[1:03:19] the new he's never changed never lost
[1:03:22] his power
[1:03:25] and any man or any church that says
[1:03:27] anything different is because they don't
[1:03:28] know
[1:03:32] him you must know him in the power of
[1:03:34] his resurrection and the fellowship of
[1:03:36] his
[1:03:39] suffering verse six and the servant that
[1:03:42] was sent over the Reapers answered and
[1:03:45] said it is the moabi is damsel that came
[1:03:50] back with Naomi out of the country of
[1:03:53] Moab
[1:03:55] and she said this is what Ruth had asked
[1:03:59] of them I pray you let me glean and
[1:04:03] gather after the Reapers among the Sheep
[1:04:08] let me just say this if you want
[1:04:09] something from God you're going to have
[1:04:12] to go get
[1:04:14] it and the way you go get it is with a
[1:04:17] willing heart amen is with a
[1:04:20] determination in your heart if you say
[1:04:22] well I'll just uh you know I'll just see
[1:04:24] if the Holy Ghost will come brother Bram
[1:04:26] says you might as well just stay in your
[1:04:28] seat you don't approach God that way you
[1:04:31] might say brother Samuel how could that
[1:04:33] well I you know I can't help I am listen
[1:04:36] revisit in your walk with God if you've
[1:04:39] got to a place in your walk with God
[1:04:42] where there are things that just seems
[1:04:43] kind of like halfhazard and and you know
[1:04:46] Cas sah sah listen you're not dwelling
[1:04:49] where you need to be dwelling because
[1:04:52] let me let me say this the world ain't
[1:04:54] going to give you Faith there's only one
[1:04:56] source of faith and that's from the word
[1:04:58] of God the Bible said that Faith cometh
[1:05:01] by hearing and hearing by the word of
[1:05:04] God the Bible also said in the days in
[1:05:07] this day that there would be a famine in
[1:05:09] the land and the famine would not be for
[1:05:11] bread and water but for the hearing of
[1:05:13] the word of God listen there are
[1:05:15] churches everywhere up and down but let
[1:05:18] me tell you something not all of it is
[1:05:20] the word of the Lord the word of the
[1:05:23] Lord is the spirit of God inspiring his
[1:05:26] word for this season for this moment for
[1:05:29] this hour getting a church
[1:05:33] ready let me tell you something you know
[1:05:35] how it is when you're not feeding if
[1:05:37] you're not feeding and you start to get
[1:05:39] hungry what happens to you well let me
[1:05:42] ask your wife what happens to you let me
[1:05:44] ask your family what happens to
[1:05:47] you let me see if it's 12:00 black bear
[1:05:50] 1:00 grizzly bear
[1:05:53] 2:00
[1:05:56] [Laughter]
[1:05:58] come on friends that's true true man a
[1:06:02] Christian walk is not just something
[1:06:04] that's just well you know this is just
[1:06:05] it's just going to happen no we have a
[1:06:08] responsibility to go into the field and
[1:06:10] glean that's why the prophet could say
[1:06:13] pray for
[1:06:15] Revelation I wonder if we would weigh
[1:06:17] our prayers out how many times we're
[1:06:19] praying about so many other things Lord
[1:06:22] bless me here Lord help me on the job
[1:06:24] and God's concerned about all those
[1:06:25] things but how many times are we really
[1:06:28] praying about the things that are of the
[1:06:30] greatest value because let me tell you
[1:06:32] something Revelation from the Throne of
[1:06:35] God will stabilize you it'll give you a
[1:06:39] vision and an insight and a direction
[1:06:41] for the things you face in this life
[1:06:43] it'll stabilize you and it'll bring a
[1:06:46] reflection from the king of glory into
[1:06:48] your
[1:06:50] life so she
[1:06:53] came and she hath continued from the
[1:06:55] morning until now that she carried a
[1:06:58] little in the
[1:07:00] house she was she was
[1:07:08] gleaning I many remember
[1:07:11] that that's not just a memory I remember
[1:07:14] when God first got a hold of my life
[1:07:16] Brother Sam did you understand I didn't
[1:07:18] understand
[1:07:19] everything all I know is I just kept
[1:07:21] playing the
[1:07:22] message I kept reading and I'm just
[1:07:25] going to be honest with you I I don't
[1:07:27] care what you think of me I you know
[1:07:29] sometimes I could get lost in the Book
[1:07:30] of Leviticus and numbers I don't now but
[1:07:33] I went to the New Testament I'm not
[1:07:35] going to be held back from the
[1:07:37] promises I can read through that or read
[1:07:40] through the Psalms read through the
[1:07:41] Proverbs listen let me tell you
[1:07:43] something don't get caught up with
[1:07:44] trying to figure things out in your mind
[1:07:46] just go out there and
[1:07:49] [Applause]
[1:07:50] [Music]
[1:07:51] glean just glean
[1:07:56] Hallelujah very very simple things go
[1:07:58] out and
[1:07:59] glean you got to glean for for what you
[1:08:02] you have need of let me tell you
[1:08:03] something when God promised to to supply
[1:08:06] Mana to Israel he didn't have them open
[1:08:08] up a chute in their tent and say I'll
[1:08:10] drop it right in your
[1:08:12] tent he had it fall on the ground he
[1:08:16] tested their obedience their willingness
[1:08:18] their love their favor by would they get
[1:08:21] out of their tent and go gather
[1:08:26] Mana are you hearing me he's the same
[1:08:28] God
[1:08:29] today where are we going to go and
[1:08:32] gather it things that sometimes seem to
[1:08:34] be a little Beyond us and if it's a
[1:08:37] little Beyond us well you know I'm just
[1:08:39] going to you know it's got to be God's
[1:08:40] will and I don't want to get ahead of
[1:08:42] God no you got to lay hold everything
[1:08:44] you get in god you're going to have to
[1:08:46] fight for
[1:08:48] it don't let the spirit of this age get
[1:08:50] on
[1:08:51] you where everything is dropped and
[1:08:54] things are dropped in your mailbox and
[1:08:56] you don't have to go to work and you
[1:08:57] don't have to do nothing and we'll give
[1:08:59] you a phone and don't get under that
[1:09:00] spirit it's a spirit of entitlement we
[1:09:03] are not of the spirit of entitlement
[1:09:06] listen the Bible said the kingdom of God
[1:09:09] it's suffereth violence but the violence
[1:09:12] take it by
[1:09:14] force if you want to serve God it'll be
[1:09:17] a fight but it's a fight worth
[1:09:21] fighting Hallelujah anything you want
[1:09:24] out of God you're going to have to fight
[1:09:26] your way you'll have to fight beyond
[1:09:28] your will you'll have to fight beyond
[1:09:30] your
[1:09:31] thoughts but it's worth it I said it's
[1:09:35] worth
[1:09:36] [Applause]
[1:09:49] it how the kinsman
[1:09:52] redeemer
[1:09:54] Ruth in her heart in her
[1:09:56] heart forgive me my words get confused
[1:09:59] I'm just a little weary but Ruth in her
[1:10:02] heart not knowing where she was
[1:10:05] going but a type of the church we
[1:10:08] sojourn like pil like Abraham pilgrims
[1:10:11] in a Strange Land among strange
[1:10:17] people now I'm not going to ask you to
[1:10:19] raise your hand but I think everybody
[1:10:20] can
[1:10:22] Witness
[1:10:24] when God opens
[1:10:26] doors in our
[1:10:28] lives sometimes we almost look at it it
[1:10:30] seems
[1:10:31] like that seems almost too
[1:10:36] easy it seems like well Brother Sam what
[1:10:38] you just got done saying we're going to
[1:10:39] have to press our pressing is beyond our
[1:10:42] own will to look to
[1:10:44] him that I I'm I'm going to keep looking
[1:10:47] I don't care I might have stumbled but
[1:10:50] I'm getting back up and I'm looking
[1:10:52] because he who made the promise is fa
[1:10:55] faithful that's what that's what the
[1:10:57] prophet said Abraham was not so much
[1:10:59] looking at the promise but who made it
[1:11:01] because if you can get a glimpse of who
[1:11:03] made the promise that's what makes the
[1:11:06] promise real it lifts it from just a
[1:11:09] man's word cuz a man's word won't act
[1:11:12] like
[1:11:15] that but sometimes you come into things
[1:11:17] and you wonder man this door's open
[1:11:19] shouldn't I have a lot of opposition
[1:11:21] shouldn't I have this shouldn't I have
[1:11:22] this shouldn't I have that let me tell
[1:11:24] you something when you're walking in
[1:11:27] step with God the Bible said when a
[1:11:29] man's ways please the Lord right he
[1:11:31] maketh even his enemies to be at peace
[1:11:33] with
[1:11:35] him think about when when Peter walked
[1:11:38] Walked Out they were down there praying
[1:11:40] and when
[1:11:41] Peter in the in that solitary
[1:11:44] confinement the angel of the Lord went
[1:11:47] down there the rest of the guards are
[1:11:48] asleep and he goes down there and he
[1:11:51] loosens the hold upon him
[1:11:54] let me tell you something the angel of
[1:11:56] the Lord can bind every
[1:12:00] spirit in a spirit that's troubling you
[1:12:03] that says you can't go free that you're
[1:12:06] not a son and daughter of God the angel
[1:12:08] of the Lord can bind him up and loosen
[1:12:12] you
[1:12:14] amen he specializes in that there's
[1:12:17] never my I'm going to preach there's
[1:12:20] nobody that has ever been able to beat
[1:12:23] the reconnaissance missions of the Angel
[1:12:26] of the Lord he knows right where he
[1:12:28] where his church is he knows right where
[1:12:30] his children are I don't care if the
[1:12:32] arrows are the thickest and the bullets
[1:12:34] are flying there is nothing that can
[1:12:36] keep the Lord Jesus away from his
[1:12:39] children there were walls all around
[1:12:41] Jericho and Rahab couldn't get out so
[1:12:45] God brought the walls
[1:12:48] down you might be walled up with
[1:12:51] unbelief there might be all sort of
[1:12:53] thoughts around your life right now but
[1:12:56] let the presence of God go to work and
[1:12:58] that which is standing between you and
[1:13:01] full Victory watch him bring it down to
[1:13:04] your
[1:13:06] [Applause]
[1:13:14] feet I'm going I'm just going to tell

[1:13:18] think it's much but for

[1:16:44] thine iniquities I'm the Lord that
[1:16:45] Health all thine diseases forget not my
[1:16:51] benefits what a blessing
[1:16:53] I said I told my wife I said honey after
[1:16:55] all this is right here I said my bills I
[1:16:57] said it's back to where it was I said
[1:16:59] before we did
[1:17:01] anything I know I wasn't very spiritual
[1:17:04] but my point is what I'm trying to tell
[1:17:05] you is that sometimes how God is leading
[1:17:08] things and sometimes we come into things
[1:17:10] and we wonder and we look at it and we
[1:17:12] think this seems too easy let me tell
[1:17:15] you something from your heart there's a
[1:17:17] willingness to press on God opens doors
[1:17:21] for his children
[1:17:23] God makes a way just like with Ruth it
[1:17:26] wasn't just happen stance she was
[1:17:29] directed by the spirit of God to that
[1:17:33] portion of the
[1:17:34] field
[1:17:36] my now let let me can I I read on here
[1:17:39] just a little bit brother BR say she
[1:17:41] went in the second paragraph on she went
[1:17:44] and finally she came into the room in
[1:17:45] the place where Naomi was bringing her
[1:17:47] and what did she
[1:17:49] find everybody patting her on the back
[1:17:51] and saying Ruth we're glad glad to have
[1:17:53] you down here nope she found Discord she
[1:17:56] found something evil she found trouble
[1:18:00] right and preachers that'll tell you the
[1:18:02] Christian Life is a flowery bed of ease
[1:18:05] he is either deceiving you or he's never
[1:18:07] accepted that experience himself the
[1:18:10] world hates you and the people will hate
[1:18:13] you but let me just tell you it isn't
[1:18:14] you really they hate it's because what's
[1:18:17] on the inside of
[1:18:21] you are you hearing me it's what's on
[1:18:24] the inside of you so don't take it
[1:18:27] personal God allows those things to mold
[1:18:31] our
[1:18:37] character oh he says the people will
[1:18:39] hate you I many place of scripture we
[1:18:41] can go but I'm just going to stay with
[1:18:42] it you got to take the way of the Lord's
[1:18:44] despise few and be laughed at made fun
[1:18:46] of or anything else you've got to be
[1:18:48] different you're born of another Nation
[1:18:51] he said you know my wife Wasing talking
[1:18:53] about what you know why don't the
[1:18:54] Christian women wear these clothes like
[1:18:56] the other women do we're all Americans
[1:18:58] aren't we I said no sir well what are we
[1:19:02] I said we're neither Germans French
[1:19:04] Belgium Swiss African or Americans or
[1:19:08] none of them but what are we we're
[1:19:11] Christians American acts like American
[1:19:15] German acts like a German because that's
[1:19:17] their National spirit and we have a
[1:19:20] national Spirit that's the holy Spirit
[1:19:23] coming from God out of heaven and you
[1:19:26] act like that it makes you conduct
[1:19:28] yourself as they do up there because you
[1:19:31] are of another
[1:19:36] world you're only reflecting the world
[1:19:39] you're going to there ain't no world
[1:19:41] going back in to that
[1:19:43] world this is why listen friends you can
[1:19:46] look for many different evidences and
[1:19:48] this and that but let me just tell you
[1:19:50] if the you still love the world or the
[1:19:53] things of the world the Fashions of the
[1:19:55] world and the world itself then the love
[1:19:58] of God has never entered into your heart
[1:20:01] that is where your evidence
[1:20:05] rests doesn't matter if you could speak
[1:20:07] in tongues you could run the eyes you
[1:20:09] could quote like a Gatlin gun but if you
[1:20:12] still love the
[1:20:14] world you've not yet
[1:20:16] arrived and remember Deus forsook Paul
[1:20:20] having loved this present world but Deus
[1:20:22] didn't go back out into bars and saloons
[1:20:24] and everything else he didn't want to go
[1:20:27] according to God's revealed way for the
[1:20:32] hour that's are you hearing me we're
[1:20:36] living in America that's true that's the
[1:20:38] body part but the soul that conducts us
[1:20:42] our character is from above we live from
[1:20:45] above because we're born from above all
[1:20:48] Christians come from above and Jesus
[1:20:50] said I am not from below I'm from above
[1:20:53] if I was from below my subjects would
[1:20:55] fight for me but my kingdom is of above
[1:20:58] so every man that's born of the kingdom
[1:21:00] of God is from above now watch he says
[1:21:04] that we find them coming into a
[1:21:06] disappointment talking about Ruth and
[1:21:08] Naomi remember when Naomi came back she
[1:21:10] they said oh Naomi she said don't call
[1:21:11] me Naomi call me
[1:21:15] Mara
[1:21:17] because it has brought about a
[1:21:20] bitterness a sorrow that she's returned
[1:21:23] she's lost her
[1:21:27] husband said isn't that where you come
[1:21:30] into when you got the Holy Ghost you
[1:21:32] sure did making fun of and
[1:21:35] everything life was hard for him that's
[1:21:37] what the Bible said that you know once
[1:21:39] you be uh became a part of of the way
[1:21:43] that God walking in the way of God you
[1:21:45] watch every devil Out of Hell turn his
[1:21:48] gun you watch how things will rise up
[1:21:51] listen as soon as you begin to make a
[1:21:53] step for God and things listen expect
[1:21:56] the enemy is going to rise up but
[1:21:58] remember he's only doing that to try to
[1:22:01] get you
[1:22:04] distracted and let me just tell you this
[1:22:07] it ain't your boss it ain't your brother
[1:22:09] it ain't your sister if you allow
[1:22:11] yourself to be distracted that's on you
[1:22:14] amen come on friends we got to take
[1:22:16] things down to personal we got to get
[1:22:18] out of that first nature of always
[1:22:19] passing the buck my problems on me on my
[1:22:23] my problems or somebody else's problem
[1:22:24] if somebody else then if there is such a
[1:22:26] rule upon your life that you can't live
[1:22:29] in Victory that way then you need to ask
[1:22:31] God put a victory in the Gable into my
[1:22:34] soul that no matter what goes along the
[1:22:37] love of God will burn through my heart
[1:22:39] and I'm not going to blame nobody else
[1:22:41] but recognize it's a test it's a trial
[1:22:44] it's a temptation but I'm going on with
[1:22:46] the Lord
[1:22:48] Jesus cuz let me tell you when you stand
[1:22:51] there that day there ain't going going
[1:22:52] to be no blame games
[1:22:54] work brother Samuel that's rough you
[1:22:56] want me to tell you the truth now don't
[1:22:58] you you don't want me to want to
[1:23:00] deceiver standing here in front of you
[1:23:02] you want somebody that really loves you
[1:23:04] that'll tell you the truth you don't
[1:23:06] want these so-called friends that get
[1:23:08] around and you make a post on Facebook
[1:23:10] and they just join in like a pack of
[1:23:12] wolves to strip somebody down you want
[1:23:15] to have real friends the Bible said
[1:23:18] faithful are the wounds of a true friend
[1:23:21] that means somebody that'll tell you the
[1:23:23] truth and where you're lacking in your
[1:23:25] life and don't go that way don't head
[1:23:28] that way what that's a real
[1:23:31] friend but a friend that's always
[1:23:33] patting you on the back the Bible said
[1:23:35] kisses are
[1:23:37] deceitful that's
[1:23:40] good come on friends we're living in a
[1:23:44] day and an hour they we have more
[1:23:45] kissing preachers than
[1:23:48] everything some of the biggest sissies
[1:23:50] in the pull pit and people are being
[1:23:52] being kissed their way to
[1:23:56] hell that's the truth friends it's a sad
[1:23:59] reality there's hearts that are longing
[1:24:00] for God let me to tell you something
[1:24:02] every heart that's longing for God God
[1:24:05] knows where to find
[1:24:06] them God will not leave them in that
[1:24:10] mess let me just say it like this lives
[1:24:13] don't want to preach the message God
[1:24:14] will deliver
[1:24:16] Hearts this message was meant to be
[1:24:19] preached in its power and its glory and
[1:24:21] bring people under the influence of the
[1:24:24] absolute of this
[1:24:28] hour Hallelujah God don't need men
[1:24:31] picking it this way and picking it this
[1:24:32] way and picking it this way preach
[1:24:42] it yes
[1:24:45] sir life was hard for
[1:24:49] her it's hard after you become a
[1:24:52] Christian I don't know how many times I
[1:24:53] had people that wrote me after God got a
[1:24:57] hold of my
[1:24:59] life even on the Antiquated email that
[1:25:03] we had back then it was on a screen that
[1:25:05] wasn't color it was black and had orange
[1:25:08] letters on
[1:25:09] it I don't think the dinosaurs delivered
[1:25:12] it
[1:25:13] either but I had people that contacted
[1:25:15] me from maretta where how did they get
[1:25:17] my email right how did they get my email
[1:25:20] after God had got a hold of my life
[1:25:22] but they contacted me
[1:25:24] hey hey we heard that something happened
[1:25:28] to you how I don't know I don't know you
[1:25:30] see it wasn't I know right now for the
[1:25:32] young people it's kind of hard because
[1:25:33] one little thing right now goes around
[1:25:35] the world it wasn't so then I don't know
[1:25:38] how I don't know who those people were
[1:25:39] even contacted to they were not
[1:25:41] contacted to any of my friends or
[1:25:43] anybody that I knew back home how did
[1:25:44] they know that I don't know I don't know
[1:25:47] just like when I'm standing there
[1:25:49] working in pennies and selling suits and
[1:25:51] I had different ones come right around
[1:25:53] me on a Friday
[1:25:56] night
[1:25:58] Browning how's it
[1:26:03] going you I understand you don't you
[1:26:05] know go out and move around in certain
[1:26:09] areas no more picking snickering and
[1:26:15] laughing you think there wasn't some
[1:26:17] sort of like where that tingling feeling
[1:26:19] would want to move over you but there
[1:26:22] was something that was
[1:26:25] deeper and I could stand there and tell
[1:26:27] him I said the only thing I can tell you
[1:26:28] is is I met him amen I didn't know a lot
[1:26:32] of scripture I didn't know a lot of
[1:26:33] scripture but the only thing I told him
[1:26:35] is I met
[1:26:36] him I wasn't brainwashed at a church
[1:26:39] camp that's the word that was going
[1:26:41] around in sesy I'm off my notes but
[1:26:44] we're going to go with
[1:26:45] this Lord they said he's brainwashed his
[1:26:49] mom and daddy sent him away to a church
[1:26:50] camp they did that already there was a
[1:26:52] couple times but you know what it only
[1:26:54] lasted so long until there came a real
[1:26:57] meeting with God let me tell you I thank
[1:27:00] God for every time that I had at a
[1:27:01] church camp don't you ever as a young
[1:27:03] person as a middleaged don't you ever
[1:27:05] discount any experience you've had with
[1:27:07] God
[1:27:09] never it was not a failure it was God
[1:27:12] letting you know he's
[1:27:14] God when God met Jacob at bethl the
[1:27:17] first time he didn't change him but
[1:27:20] Jacob knew what my daddy talked about
[1:27:23] he's
[1:27:25] real and when that God spoke to him and
[1:27:28] situations changeed and laban's count
[1:27:30] countenance change and God said get thee
[1:27:33] back to
[1:27:34] bethl right right he knew where to come
[1:27:37] back to so the experiences you've had
[1:27:39] are not failures you need to throw that
[1:27:42] to the ground this morning except God's
[1:27:45] go Brother Sam I've been to camp after
[1:27:47] Camp banquet after banquet I've been
[1:27:49] here I've been there but don't let it
[1:27:50] was not a failure every
[1:27:53] experience if you let it it's God
[1:27:55] molding you and tendering you but don't
[1:27:59] stop gleaning
[1:28:01] amen when God does something for you
[1:28:05] glean
[1:28:14] glean oh watch this life was hard it was
[1:28:16] hard after you become a Christian
[1:28:18] because you got to adjust yourself from
[1:28:21] one life of gity and pleasures of the
[1:28:24] world to another life of consecration to
[1:28:27] God you've got to readjust yourself over
[1:28:31] into this side is't that incredible
[1:28:32] words you've got to adjust
[1:28:36] yourself you adjust yourself there's
[1:28:39] things that you begin to do because it's
[1:28:42] the right thing to do there's a
[1:28:44] willingness you may not all to see
[1:28:46] altogether see the value of it you may
[1:28:48] not see altogether the value but when
[1:28:51] you take God at his word there is a
[1:28:53] value in obedience just like when you're
[1:28:56] planting that seed The Field's being
[1:28:58] dissed up and the seed is being planted
[1:29:00] you don't altogether see the full value
[1:29:02] of it until the crop comes up and then
[1:29:06] every bit of Labor has been worth
[1:29:09] it and you have to readjust or adjust
[1:29:13] yourself to those things that are coming
[1:29:15] on you know this is why when the spirit
[1:29:18] of God is dealing with our hearts and
[1:29:20] lives and we're asking God well I I need
[1:29:22] the Lord to take this I need the Lord to
[1:29:23] take this like the prophet tells us in
[1:29:25] marriage of the Lamb the Bible says that
[1:29:28] this this bride in Revelations 19 let us
[1:29:31] be glad and rejoice for the marriage of
[1:29:32] the Lamb has come and his bride hath
[1:29:34] made herself
[1:29:37] ready is that right brother B said many
[1:29:40] people say oh if God only take this evil
[1:29:42] spirit from me if he only take this
[1:29:44] gambling if he only take this drinking
[1:29:46] if he only take this of the Fashions of
[1:29:47] the world if he'll just take it away he
[1:29:49] said no you've got something to do
[1:29:52] you see simple obedience by simply
[1:29:55] saying Lord I'm going to take you at
[1:29:58] your word and lay it there before God
[1:30:01] and watch the fire of God come down and
[1:30:04] consume those Desires in your
[1:30:07] life Hey listen I'm not preaching
[1:30:10] something I'm reading off the back of a
[1:30:11] cereal box I'm preaching it by
[1:30:14] experience
[1:30:17] right Ruth had to adjust herself from
[1:30:20] being in a land where plenty to eat
[1:30:23] everything respected to a people that
[1:30:25] was laughing making fun of her into a
[1:30:27] land she gleaned in the field for what
[1:30:31] she eat verse eight of Ruth
[1:30:34] 2 let me try to come down here Ben said
[1:30:38] Boaz unto Ruth now he approaches her now
[1:30:42] he's asked who is she right he's
[1:30:44] informed this is who she is now watch
[1:30:47] his approach his approach was first of
[1:30:49] all to the chief Reaper that was over
[1:30:53] the
[1:30:55] servants then the commun then it was
[1:30:58] communicated to him of who this is then
[1:31:02] he himself makes his approach personally
[1:31:07] to her isn't that how God has done your
[1:31:10] life God has sent the message and the
[1:31:13] message has brought a personal approach
[1:31:16] between you and the Lord
[1:31:20] Jesus to where he have him clipped up
[1:31:22] behind somebody else or in front of a
[1:31:24] great group of men and you've got to
[1:31:26] come through us to get to God that ain't
[1:31:29] how God said it up not at all God never
[1:31:32] elevated man but and by by through the
[1:31:36] shed blood man has been brought into a
[1:31:39] place to have direct contact and
[1:31:42] fellowship and communion with God
[1:31:45] absolutely there is no
[1:31:48] mediator between God and man but the man
[1:31:51] ch Christ Jesus you don't have listen if
[1:31:54] you you could tell your sins to me it
[1:31:57] won't do you no no good it won't do you
[1:31:59] bit of good but if you confess your sins
[1:32:02] to the Lord
[1:32:04] Jesus he's the one that can take care of
[1:32:07] the problems in your life he's the one
[1:32:11] that'll free you no man can do that only
[1:32:14] he
[1:32:16] can let me try to finish here or
[1:32:20] pause Ben said Boaz unto Ruth hearest
[1:32:24] thou
[1:32:25] not my daughter look at this term of
[1:32:29] endearment my daughter God uses terms of
[1:32:35] of endearment and
[1:32:37] infection hearest thou my daughter you
[1:32:41] see God has a way of speaking his his
[1:32:43] first approach to you and I is is calm
[1:32:46] us so good is to speak to us that's so
[1:32:49] good he's letting her know what what he
[1:32:51] thinks about
[1:32:53] her go not now watch this go not to
[1:32:56] glean in another
[1:32:58] field neither go from hence but

[1:35:53] leading and go Thou after them have not
[1:35:57] I charged the young men that they shall
[1:35:59] not touch thee and when thou art a
[1:36:02] thirst go unto the vessels and drink of
[1:36:05] that which the young men have drawn what
[1:36:09] a
[1:36:10] privilege let me just let me close here
[1:36:13] on this on this quote here right here
[1:36:14] this
[1:36:17] morning Lord will will pick it
[1:36:19] up brother says notice here Bri it's out
[1:36:23] the message Redeemer
[1:36:25] Redemption he said notice he said when
[1:36:27] he went over there to her he said now
[1:36:29] look don't you leave this field I wish
[1:36:32] we had time to park there for a few
[1:36:34] minutes don't you leave this field
[1:36:37] that's the way it is stay put oh he says
[1:36:41] I I know I'm just just a little wild but
[1:36:44] he says look stay where you are every
[1:36:47] man that's born of the spirit of God
[1:36:49] when he set in Christ
[1:36:51] his eyes is on
[1:36:53] Calvary right in the middle of the road
[1:36:59] now watch he said if he's just a little
[1:37:00] bit emotional the first thing you know
[1:37:03] he'll work out over here to a side and
[1:37:06] the first thing he'll become a fanatic
[1:37:09] if he don't watch if he's just a little
[1:37:11] starchy educated he'll work over here on
[1:37:14] this side and be so cold and stiff and
[1:37:16] starchy and take all the spirit out of
[1:37:18] him if the devil can't keep you from
[1:37:20] seeing the the truth he'll push you off
[1:37:23] of the deep end with
[1:37:27] it what must balanced keep your
[1:37:31] eyes on the Reapers that are in front of
[1:37:33] you because it's the word that's being
[1:37:37] delivered in season in the field and let
[1:37:40] me just say this to you everything this
[1:37:42] is what I found this is my testimony I
[1:37:44] have found that everything God knows the
[1:37:46] decisions that I'm going to be facing
[1:37:48] even in the week the month the year and
[1:37:51] God is preparing he's guiding he's
[1:37:54] influencing he's changing us he's
[1:37:56] molding us he knows what's coming and as
[1:37:59] we'll stay in step with the word we
[1:38:01] don't have to try to make our own
[1:38:03] way if you will stay in step with him he
[1:38:07] will not only add to your life
[1:38:09] spiritually what needs to be added in
[1:38:11] your life but he'll make everything work
[1:38:14] for your
[1:38:16] good that isn't a promise of a
[1:38:18] Prosperity Gospel I'm talking about a
[1:38:20] god that'll take you through when tests
[1:38:22] or Trials come your way because there
[1:38:25] are tests and trials as you're walking
[1:38:27] this way there are temptations that come
[1:38:29] this way but if you keep your eyes on
[1:38:32] him amen and stay
[1:38:36] put don't allow the enemy to pull it out
[1:38:38] of
[1:38:39] you things that God wants to put into
[1:38:42] your
[1:38:44] life if you're not careful by the time
[1:38:47] that you get to the end of this street
[1:38:50] somebody's already cut out in front of
[1:38:51] you and the Very things that God has
[1:38:54] wanted to put in you you find
[1:38:59] yourself who we got quiet in here now
[1:39:03] but you understand listen you understand
[1:39:05] that's Satan's tactic to try to move you
[1:39:09] out of the field he's trying to move you
[1:39:12] away because listen the things that
[1:39:14] you're reaping as you're gleaning it and
[1:39:17] you're meditating on it and you're
[1:39:19] thinking upon it you're praying upon it
[1:39:21] let me tell you what's happening there's
[1:39:23] transformation taking place in your
[1:39:27] life this is why the prophet could say
[1:39:30] in Christ The Mystery of God revealed he
[1:39:32] said what God that great mystery God's
[1:39:34] wanting to get to you he said you let
[1:39:36] your job take it out of you you let
[1:39:39] family you let other things take it out
[1:39:41] of you that's right so just remember
[1:39:44] that's what Satan's desire is to do to
[1:39:46] try to draw us out of that field get us
[1:39:49] away from his presence
[1:39:52] when we get away from his presence
[1:39:54] listen friends one of the shest signs of
[1:39:56] the world we get away from his presence
[1:39:58] we in our own selves we start getting
[1:40:02] prickly we start getting touchy oh
[1:40:06] yes come on
[1:40:10] now I don't know about you but I I I
[1:40:12] don't not going to say oh that's just my
[1:40:14] flesh no God's given me a Dominion to
[1:40:16] rule over
[1:40:17] that he said if we live in the spirit
[1:40:20] let us also walk in the spirit and if
[1:40:23] you'll walk in the spirit you shall not
[1:40:25] fulfill the lust of the
[1:40:29] flesh it's staying in this field staying
[1:40:34] and gleaning you know sometimes when you
[1:40:36] glean it you're gleaning and you don't
[1:40:40] you don't altogether see a loaf of bread
[1:40:42] out there but you got to go
[1:40:44] glean right it's like here like I told
[1:40:47] the young people and many different
[1:40:49] times I said you know when we look in
[1:40:53] the New Testament there's black letter
[1:40:55] and red letter right red letter red
[1:40:58] letter says oh this is the words of the
[1:41:00] Lord Jesus that that he spoke let me
[1:41:02] just tell you something every day in
[1:41:04] your life is not a red letter
[1:41:07] day there are a lot of blackletter days
[1:41:10] true but the blackletter Days Make Way
[1:41:13] for redl
[1:41:16] moments that's a complete walk with god
[1:41:20] oh yeah I'd love it if every day was a
[1:41:22] red letter day I look for it I don't say
[1:41:24] oh today's going to be a black letter
[1:41:26] day as a matter of fact some days I
[1:41:27] thought was a black letter day brother
[1:41:29] Ray end up being a red letter day
[1:41:32] ohy CU he shows up sometimes when you
[1:41:35] least expect it so what are we going to
[1:41:38] do we're going to glean oh oh my back
[1:41:41] it's man it's hard to get down there
[1:41:43] today but I'm going to I'm going to
[1:41:44] glean I'm going to take that promise
[1:41:46] Lord that what you spoke to me here I'm
[1:41:49] going to take that amen I'm going to
[1:41:51] nourish it like the prophet said let us
[1:41:53] cherish it and nurture
[1:41:55] it obey it he said with Godly discipline
[1:41:59] until it becomes manifest in our life
[1:42:02] I'm going to take it Lord you dropped
[1:42:03] this from me you dropped this from me
[1:42:06] I'm going to take that in my life
[1:42:08] amen you love him amen let's pray
[1:42:12] Heavenly
[1:42:16] Father Lord Jesus
[1:42:18] I I'm certain Lord that in each of Our
[1:42:21] Lives Many Times
[1:42:23] Lord we see it more and more
[1:42:26] that Lord the value of obedience just
[1:42:30] simple simple simple little things lord
[1:42:34] it's not Lord the big
[1:42:36] things Lord that are left undone that
[1:42:39] hurt us it's the little
[1:42:42] things but it's the little things that
[1:42:44] lead to the bigger things that you want
[1:42:46] to do in our
[1:42:48] lives Lord I'm sure that just as much as
[1:42:52] we said that Ruth when she went out
[1:42:53] there to that field that day and she was
[1:42:55] even moved to make that decision I'm
[1:42:58] sure Lord that maybe she didn't she
[1:43:01] didn't feel spiritual no doubt there
[1:43:04] were days that she went out there but
[1:43:07] she
[1:43:09] knew what a desire was in her
[1:43:12] heart that I want to serve God no matter
[1:43:16] what I'm willing to let go of the things
[1:43:19] of this life
[1:43:21] and this
[1:43:22] world I'm willing Lord I I want to serve
[1:43:25] you whatever it takes whatever you ask
[1:43:28] that's what I want to do it's not too
[1:43:30] much Lord it might be Lord God where my
[1:43:33] flesh Lord in your presence I can be
[1:43:36] honest with you if there's things that
[1:43:38] I'm still struggling with Lord God as I
[1:43:42] step into that Lord for the hearts of
[1:43:44] others Lord that would pray this along
[1:43:47] and have that upon their heart to say
[1:43:49] Lord there's things that I struggle with
[1:43:52] but I know that you're not ashamed you
[1:43:55] came down and talked to me this morning
[1:43:58] but I'm asking you Lord that you would
[1:44:00] take that from my life Lord I don't want
[1:44:04] anything that Lord I don't want those
[1:44:05] things of the world I know what's wrong
[1:44:08] Lord God take Lord God everything Lord
[1:44:11] every habit take everything from me Lord
[1:44:14] that Lord God is hindering a deeper Walk
[1:44:17] with You
[1:44:18] Lord oh Father I I prayed this morning
[1:44:22] Lord God as Ruth was in that
[1:44:25] field I'd say Lord there were days and
[1:44:28] mornings when she got up oh she was
[1:44:32] weary Lord God she came from a land
[1:44:35] where there was
[1:44:38] plenty and now when she came into this
[1:44:41] land the laws and the direction of it
[1:44:45] Lord the gleaning that was to be
[1:44:48] done by the maidens Lord father she
[1:44:52] would go out Lord
[1:44:54] Jesus no doubt there were days as we
[1:44:57] said that she maybe didn't feel just
[1:45:01] exactly up to going out and
[1:45:03] gleaning I'm sure that she did not see
[1:45:07] the full
[1:45:08] value of The
[1:45:11] Obedience just even at the beginning
[1:45:14] when she made her
[1:45:16] decision she had no way of
[1:45:19] knowing what what would transpire
[1:45:22] through her life that there would be a
[1:45:25] union with her and Naomi's
[1:45:29] Kinsman Boaz she had no idea
[1:45:33] Lord that this awaited
[1:45:36] her but that mystery laid there the
[1:45:39] whole
[1:45:40] time lord there's things about it in our
[1:45:43] life that Lord Jesus we come to and you
[1:45:47] show us just as we have have need of it
[1:45:52] Lord I'm asking through this building
[1:45:54] here this morning Lord father from every
[1:45:57] visitor is here Lord to everyone Lord
[1:45:59] that father would attend and Lord God
[1:46:02] call this their home assembly Lord Jesus
[1:46:06] May every one of us
[1:46:08] Lord
[1:46:10] father be faithful in gleaning in the
[1:46:14] field
[1:46:15] Lord Lord God gleaning of the promises
[1:46:19] Lord we realize there's a hpe here that
[1:46:21] Lord where Ruth was in a stage of her
[1:46:24] journey of her walk with you but in
[1:46:27] reality Lord once a person has really
[1:46:30] been United with you that gleaning as
[1:46:33] far as taking in of the word praying
[1:46:37] reading the word those are sacred
[1:46:39] virtues that are entrusted to us that
[1:46:42] never ceases Lord there's a desire I
[1:46:45] want to know him more I want to know him
[1:46:48] more Lord this message oh God I feel the
[1:46:52] same way Lord as your Prophet said when
[1:46:54] you came down there in Sabino Canyon
[1:46:56] Lord and begin to make make known your
[1:46:58] will he said it's wound me into this
[1:47:00] Bible tighter than ever before Lord
[1:47:03] Jesus we love you father Lord I'm so
[1:47:07] thankful to be in this field Lord I
[1:47:10] remember as a young man I sat around
[1:47:13] it I remember that
[1:47:16] Papa but Lord I'm so glad that Lord you
[1:47:19] begin to to deal with My
[1:47:22] Heart Lord I the way that Lord that you
[1:47:25] have taken me Lord the way that you've
[1:47:28] brought me through in my journey Lord
[1:47:30] I've seen many times with things the way
[1:47:32] you've dealt with me Lord so that I
[1:47:33] would be able to relate to others Lord
[1:47:36] and be able to minister and to help them
[1:47:39] Lord oh God I pray that Lord Jesus May
[1:47:44] Lord God that reality Lord Jesus of this
[1:47:47] field lord of the precious promises Lord
[1:47:50] of what lays here in our midst Lord may
[1:47:56] we lord God I pray gleaning it for our
[1:47:58] families for our homes for our lives
[1:48:01] Lord oh God a word that Lord Jesus will
[1:48:05] change us one of these days in a moment
[1:48:09] and a twinkling of an eye Lord God Lord
[1:48:12] help us father help us Lord help every
[1:48:15] one of us Lord God lord Jesus if there's
[1:48:19] anything that Lord has attracted the
[1:48:21] attention maybe lord it's been things of
[1:48:23] of this life and of this world and Lord
[1:48:25] there's lives and hearts that would want
[1:48:26] to be honest with you this morning and
[1:48:28] say Lord I I I'm here in the field but
[1:48:31] yet Lord I I'm really not where I need
[1:48:32] to be with you I've allowed other things
[1:48:35] to take Lord God to take the joy of the
[1:48:37] Lord out of my life I've just been going
[1:48:40] through seems like just ritual brother
[1:48:42] Samuel just just just going just through
[1:48:44] the motions of things there's just no
[1:48:46] joy I but I I want the joy of his
[1:48:49] salvation
[1:48:51] restored in my life Lord Jesus you're
[1:48:55] here to do that Lord it doesn't take
[1:48:58] Lord God some great big steps it takes
[1:49:02] Lord God a willingness from the heart to
[1:49:04] recognize where we've drifted from and
[1:49:07] Lord God wear Lord little things that
[1:49:09] we've allowed little by little by little
[1:49:12] by little by little to get us away from
[1:49:15] the most important
[1:49:18] thing Lord when it comes
[1:49:21] down to the closing moments of this life
[1:49:24] no doubt Lord some that are sitting
[1:49:26] under the sound of my
[1:49:28] voice we'll come to that don't matter
[1:49:30] what age we are we don't have the
[1:49:32] promise of the next
[1:49:34] minute but father there's nothing
[1:49:38] greater than your loving
[1:49:41] kindness that's why David could write he
[1:49:43] had found it to be greater than life thy
[1:49:48] loving kindness your life Lord your will
[1:49:54] oh father I pray this morning
[1:49:56] Lord may you Lord
[1:49:59] Jesus oh God just moving Lord God Upon
[1:50:03] Our Hearts if there's things Lord that
[1:50:05] father we've allowed Lord God to take
[1:50:07] our attention away from you may we not
[1:50:09] just Lord just just look at it lightly
[1:50:12] but may we lord truly from our heart say
[1:50:14] Lord I want to really stay in the field
[1:50:18] the right way because when he said abide
[1:50:23] here he
[1:50:25] meant not just to stand there not just
[1:50:28] to sit
[1:50:30] there but he
[1:50:32] meant to move
[1:50:34] there operate there go forward
[1:50:38] there Lord
[1:50:41] Jesus help us Lord I
[1:50:44] pray you're here to minister to us
[1:50:47] Lord you're here to minister to to our
[1:50:50] hearts here to encourage
[1:50:53] us like
[1:50:55] Boaz would say to
[1:50:58] Ruth go not to another
[1:51:01] field abide here in this field stay
[1:51:06] here remain here he asked her to stay in
[1:51:11] his
[1:51:12] field oh Lord
[1:51:18] God Ruth never asked asked
[1:51:22] him Boaz asked
[1:51:25] Ruth Lord it wasn't us seeking you it
[1:51:29] was you seeking after
[1:51:32] us it was you that approached us Lord
[1:51:37] God after the
[1:51:41] decisions that laboring in the
[1:51:44] field and you would come and speak to
[1:51:48] us
[1:51:51] maybe if it's been a while since you've
[1:51:52] heard from
[1:51:53] him why don't you just examine let the
[1:51:56] Holy Spirit just examine your
[1:51:59] heart have you been gleaning as you
[1:52:02] ought
[1:52:03] to I mean surrendering to him seeking
[1:52:07] after him is your eyes still upon the
[1:52:10] Eastern sky are you still looking for
[1:52:12] the coming of the
[1:52:15] Lord or you just looking for oh I can't
[1:52:17] wait till night gets here till I can go
[1:52:19] to bed I can't wait till the morning and
[1:52:22] no doubt there's pressures of Life
[1:52:23] friends that are
[1:52:24] real but let me just say this to you the
[1:52:27] prophet would use this term don't get in
[1:52:30] the rat race of
[1:52:31] life don't allow yourself to be drugged
[1:52:34] there oh we all have to deal with the
[1:52:36] cares of this life that's true but don't
[1:52:39] let the cares of the life rule over you
[1:52:43] Paul would warn the children of God in
[1:52:45] that hour that as we would live in the
[1:52:48] world but let us not abuse
[1:52:51] it let us not Let it rain over us we're
[1:52:54] here only for a purpose and that's to
[1:52:57] serve his
[1:53:01] purpose I wonderers our heads are bowed
[1:53:03] would there be a heart a life someone

[1:56:22] way no
[1:56:25] turning back no turning back I'm going
[1:56:29] all the
[1:56:31] way I've

[1:56:40] way I'm going all
[1:56:44] the with the
[1:56:48] Lord away
[1:56:49] [Music]
[1:56:50] all the
[1:56:53] way I'm going all the way I'm going all
[1:56:57] the
[1:56:59] way all the way going all the way I'm
[1:57:03] going all the
[1:57:06] way all the way yes I'm going all the
[1:57:13] way for I'm going all the way
[1:57:19] my
[1:57:23] Lord that verse in that song said I've
[1:57:25] made my decision and I'm going all the
[1:57:28] way you know there's always a starting
[1:57:31] point right and there's always a
[1:57:33] starting point with the Lord hlu just
[1:57:36] like you can be in a mall or somewhere
[1:57:39] and I know those things are kind of
[1:57:41] obsolete now but you know sometimes you
[1:57:44] don't know where to go cuz you don't
[1:57:46] know where you're
[1:57:47] at but when you can look at find a map
[1:57:50] that lets you know you are
[1:57:54] here then when you see where you're at
[1:57:57] then you can trace where you need to
[1:58:01] go and you see only God can show you
[1:58:05] where you're at but the God who shows
[1:58:07] you where you're at knows the desire in
[1:58:10] your heart for where you want to go he
[1:58:13] put that desire in there and it starts
[1:58:16] with the Simplicity of of confessing the
[1:58:19] Lord Jesus Christ of repenting of your
[1:58:22] sins it starts with a very simple
[1:58:25] decision that's what Ruth
[1:58:29] did that's why the scripture said repent
[1:58:32] and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:58:35] Christ for the remission of your sins
[1:58:37] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:58:39] Holy Ghost what is the gift of the Holy
[1:58:41] Ghost that's that desire there's a
[1:58:44] longing within you for God and only God
[1:58:47] can satisfy that and so what God's
[1:58:50] desire is is to lead you beyond your
[1:58:54] unbelief lead you beyond your own
[1:58:57] desires and he lets you know this is
[1:58:59] where you are and this is where I want
[1:59:01] to take
[1:59:03] you and it starts with simple simple
[1:59:07] obedience how many you know what I'm
[1:59:09] talking about it was simple obedience I
[1:59:12] I could never have even
[1:59:15] known what it would be like if God tear
[1:59:19] this coming
[1:59:20] June it will be 29
[1:59:24] years that I've been serving the
[1:59:29] lord 28 years of preaching the gospel
[1:59:32] but I could have never known it whether
[1:59:34] I ever preached or not I could have
[1:59:37] never known what Joy this is I couldn't
[1:59:41] even have imagined
[1:59:42] it I couldn't have even imagined it of
[1:59:46] the ways that God has
[1:59:48] made but you see the value of
[1:59:52] obedience don't ever despise obeying
[1:59:56] small
[1:59:57] things because when you begin to obey
[2:00:00] the word little by little by little
[2:00:03] there is a virtue of strength that's
[2:00:05] being released in your
[2:00:08] life and the things that you experience
[2:00:11] now you think Lord I didn't realize it I
[2:00:14] I didn't even realize the
[2:00:16] joy now from when I rep Ed and walked in
[2:00:20] the waters of
[2:00:21] baptism then to where God did a a
[2:00:25] capping work in our life filling us with
[2:00:27] the spirit of God my I could never have
[2:00:31] imagined I mean I've seen others and I
[2:00:34] thought I want what they've
[2:00:36] got I want what they've got I want that
[2:00:38] Joy they've got that's what I want I
[2:00:41] want that something that they have that
[2:00:42] I know that through thick and thin
[2:00:44] they're solid as a rock and they there's
[2:00:47] a joy that beats in their heart amen
[2:00:50] listen friends I lived in a home with a
[2:00:53] father and a mother they weren't perfect
[2:00:56] but they loved the Lord and let me just
[2:00:58] tell you something right now I even
[2:01:01] sitting there and sitting under the
[2:01:02] message I still couldn't figure out what
[2:01:05] made him tick that way you know why the
[2:01:08] Bible said that the mystery of godliness
[2:01:11] it's the mystery and godliness is God's
[2:01:13] spirit working in your life it's a
[2:01:15] mystery it's nothing we could read
[2:01:17] ourselves into study ourselves
[2:01:20] into it's the gift of
[2:01:23] God it's a reality that comes down on
[2:01:26] the inside the more that you surrender
[2:01:28] you know what it starts with yes
[2:01:31] Lord yes
[2:01:32] Lord come on for we don't have to make
[2:01:35] this is not hard there's times when
[2:01:37] every one of us have been in a bad mood
[2:01:39] we've woke up on the wrong side of the
[2:01:40] bed and yet we've got a choice on
[2:01:42] whether or not we're going to act grumpy
[2:01:44] or we're going to act nice is that right
[2:01:47] let's not make surrender hard we've got
[2:01:49] a choice but we do what we know is the
[2:01:52] right thing to do that is
[2:01:55] surrender so don't let the enemy
[2:01:57] discount that to you well that's nothing
[2:01:59] that's just you acting in the flesh
[2:02:01] that's you Desiring to please God that's
[2:02:04] the beginnings of surrender don't allow
[2:02:06] the enemy to take that from you it's
[2:02:08] little by little by little by little and
[2:02:12] the more you let that light come in you
[2:02:14] that light will keep penetrating in your
[2:02:16] life it'll run out every bit of malice
[2:02:19] it'll run out every bit of Envy it'll
[2:02:21] grow in your
[2:02:22] life that's what the light of God
[2:02:25] does hallelujah it's a joy it's a
[2:02:30] reality
[2:02:32] Hallelujah ain't that right brother
[2:02:35] Ryan little by little
[2:02:39] surrender this is what's right this is
[2:02:41] what I might feel like like sometimes we
[2:02:43] come here sometimes we come we don't
[2:02:45] feel like
[2:02:47] worshiping
[2:02:49] I I don't think I'm just the only one
[2:02:51] sometimes I don't feel like it I feel
[2:02:53] like just sitting maybe I'm tired I'm
[2:02:55] weary been through battles mind battle
[2:02:57] everything else but it's in that time
[2:02:59] that we press beyond that I may not feel
[2:03:03] real spiritual at that moment but he's
[2:03:05] worthy it's the right thing to
[2:03:08] do and it invites his presence right
[2:03:11] down to your life hey look they were sad
[2:03:14] on the road to emus but they began to
[2:03:16] talk about him they were disappointed
[2:03:18] cuz things didn't go as they thought it
[2:03:20] should
[2:03:21] go but they started talking talking
[2:03:23] about him but he came to him he stepped
[2:03:26] out and walked with
[2:03:30] them Hallelujah and the god that maybe
[2:03:34] you look in your life and through things
[2:03:36] that you look I'm disappointed here I'm
[2:03:38] disappointed there let me tell you
[2:03:40] something entertain him who's walking
[2:03:42] with you right now invite him in right
[2:03:47] now
[2:03:49] invite him in go beyond your flesh go
[2:03:52] beyond your thoughts go beyond your
[2:03:54] feelings and say Lord I'm going to press
[2:03:57] Beyond this barrier cuz this barrier is
[2:03:59] a
[2:04:00] lie it's only trying to K it's like a
[2:04:02] scarecrow where do you put a scarecrow
[2:04:05] at you don't put a scarecrow over a over
[2:04:08] a Barren spot of ground you put a
[2:04:10] scarecrow over things you don't want
[2:04:13] touched and the devil don't want you to
[2:04:16] get a hold of this word he don't want
[2:04:18] you to get a hold of it because this
[2:04:20] word releases to you who you really are
[2:04:23] it gives you power it gives you
[2:04:24] authority to Fly Above the things of the
[2:04:27] world this word has your identity it's
[2:04:30] the one thing that'll tell you who you
[2:04:32] are where you come from where you're
[2:04:34] going and'll be right there to tell you
[2:04:36] you're more than a
[2:04:39] conqueror that's what my Boaz does
