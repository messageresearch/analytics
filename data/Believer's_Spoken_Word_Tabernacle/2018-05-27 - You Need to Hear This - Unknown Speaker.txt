to come into it but to be invited into his presence what a wonderful wonderful privilege it is and we thank God for the opportunity that we've had here this weekend and I certainly believe with all my heart that God has arranged everything for his glory you know a lot of things a lot of we had a lot of there's a lot of different obstacles and we certainly didn't plan on it but yet when we look at it I think of even yesterday some of you know some of you may not know but when the service we were walking out of here brother bill sister Mary different ones they got there to the building they were waiting an hour and a half before we could get in to the building some breakdown had happened and different ones of you know that have rented that or your family has rented it there's never been a breakdown before but you know when you step back and you look at everything you know what it seems like there was it seemed like maybe this was out of sync or this was out of sync but you know what it was it God had everything right in control God just letting us know he's got everything in control we're not trying to spiritualize everything but it just comes down to the place to realize God's got it in control he's got it in control and we're just we're thankful for that this morning I want to heard the request about brother Danny Lewis and and they had taken him he had sent me a picture of his of his ankle and things are really really swollen bad so they had taken him to the ER because he had fallen down the stairs yesterday so we have that I know we you read that today but I also received the text from brother Jerry just moments ago brother Paul and sister Susie from the church they're in Dixon they were in a car accident and they think sister Susie may have broke something but I told him we will go straight to prayer so you know the Lord has us all in control you know we were in some meetings there in in Virginia and there was a brother that come up on that Saturday morning and we begin to pray and when he showed the testimony some of you there you remember it and he showed the testimony this this brother was 91 years old he wasn't at the meeting that morning but he was walking upstairs and the stairs that he was walking up when he he fell and he went through there's just like an opening and he fell and three or four I can't remember exactly how many steps it was a three or four steps but at any rate someone not even 91 years old could have been seriously hurt let alone he landed on a piece of furniture like this and took a piece out of the furniture so the brother who went to get him he thought this front of this this thing must have been you know kind of you know real weak so he went over there and hit his hand on it nothing moved on that furniture it was solid nothing and moved but you know when they took the brother to the hospital there wasn't one single broken bone no God is good God knows exactly what what he what he's doing you know what what came out in prayer that that morning you know is God if there's any broken bones Lord you're the healer did you just Minda I believe that the Lord I believe that the Lord did that he's still the same God so we're we want to take them them together in prayer in is there any others unspoken requests that you may have on your heart and maybe just want to be remembered before the Lord something you've got on your heart you mean God sees your hands sees your heart just keep it there before the Lord Heavenly Father Lord were standing here this morning how we are so thankful for your presence and how that you have just so guided us Lord this weekend Lord father the songs Lord this morning Lord the specials that were sung Lord were aware Lord is just a part within us of you were aware of your presence Lord your nearness and we there's needs in our lives lord there's there's needs upon hearts and Lord here there's some that's not able to be with us and others you've seen the situation of that accident Lord we're just asking father for your mercy Lord in both of these situations for brother Danny we pray that God that you'll move upon his foot Lord in his ankle there Lord I pray that you'll move right there Lord in that room Lord and father for brother Paul and sister Susie Lord we lift them up in prayer father we we just asked that Lord may your tender hand Lord Jehovah Rapha just moved Lord God for their needs right now Lord and Lord throughout this building Lord there's not one of us Lord that don't have a need the Lord with uplifted hands with hearts that are declaring Lord I have need this morning you know what that need is Lord and you're the only one that can really minister to that need I just pray this morning Lord God may there be just such a consolation Lord and Lord such a lord and ministering Lord to that need Lord God that would just be so satisfying within the heart of the individual Lord every one of my brothers and sisters Lord that they just walk out of here largest sale or day it's just declared within them it's finished it's over and Lord we just pray this morning that you'll come by or God come by and speak to our hearts once again Lord how we thank you for how that you've just so directed us this weekend Lord may you just bless your children in a real special way Lord father we just give ourselves to You Lord unreservedly we ask that if you we've said or done or thought anything wrong in any manner please forgive us Lord your God may your presence just continue to ride in upon us now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen judges chapter 7 I'm gonna take a little break from what we've been dealing with on Sundays and what is preached today so when judges chapter 7 verse 9 you love the Lord this morning how maybe you come expecting expecting to hear from him right you won't be disappointed that if we're expecting to hear from him amen because you know your expectation it it puts you in a place to where by an expectation you can't have an expectation unless you already know where you've met gone before and you're looking for God to come and speak you say Lord I know you speak to me through your word and we want him to do that this morning wanted to be personal this morning so verse 9 the judge is 7 and it came to pass the same night that the Lord said unto Him arise get thee down unto the hosts for I have delivered it into thine hand but if thou fear to go down go thou for thy servant down to the host and thou shalt hear what they say and afterward shall dine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host then when he down with furrow his servant unto the outside of the armed men that were in the host and the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude and their camels were without number as the sand by the seaside for multitude I may have you seen a picture sometimes you can see a picture maybe of like when the other elk migration where you have animals that are migrating you look out or maybe across the plains or the rolling part and you're just looking out there and it's like you can't see you can't even make it out to count it just looks like a blanket of animals that you could walk right across you know I'm talking about this is this is the setting here of the Midianites and the malachite is just like a blanket how could we even count it's just that and when Gideon was come behold there was a man that told a dream unto his fellow and said behold I dreamed a dream and lo a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian and came unto a tent and smote it that it fell and overturned it that the tent lay long and his fellow answered and said this is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of joash a man of Israel for into his hand hath God delivered Midian and all the hosts verse 15 and it was so when Gideon heard the telling of the dream and the interpretation thereof that he worshipped ghost of Midian just like to speak just a few moments on the thought you need to hear this you need to hear this that's my subject you need to hear this may God bless you your being seated you think about for a moment with my mom she was just a little bit too loud don't don't cut them off on me now when you think just for a moment of what of what faith really is we hear so much talked about that and I'm gonna really kind of I pray the Lord help me to move in in a little bit of a direction here because I want to speak to all ages that's what I always want to do but I really want to what I want to hone in on even the young people here you'll hear the word in the term faith used a lot and we look at what faith and water what is faith and faith is something that it's a substance the Bible declares it's it's something that is revealed to you it's made known to you probably every one of you here and I'll just say probably I'll pick on these guys up here if there was a little bit of a smell that came in here and it was is that right you with me on that that sound all right but you see what it is I agree you see what it is there is a sense that you would have that declares there is pizza now the only way you can Nestor's our sense that's saying somebody could be sitting next to you and say there is no way in the world we're having pizza after church but you say I know what I'm smelling because you've already experienced pizza before so you know when pizza gets near there might be garlic crust or Parmesan crust or whatever you know there's somewhere pizza somewhere close but there's a greater sense than just our natural sense there's a sense that we're given by God and that's the sense of faith to be able to contact God for God to be able to speak to us and that's God heal heal come through because a lot of our other senses sometimes they'll lie to us reasoning and and everything else sometimes things we can see it'll lie to us things that we can feel it'll lied to us faith itself will never lie it's a sense to wear that you know it's something like you can just sense the presence of God it's just how God is spoke to you before and you just you just sense when he's drawing you you just know a is here and and you might be in the midst of something that you don't have an answer for you don't even know which step or rich direction do I take but what helps you in the midst of that time is when you sense his presence and you say it's it's under control he's he's here you don't know which step to take but what you know is he's here and and as long as he's here he's my guide he's the one that can lead me he's the one that'll that'll direct me and it'll be very clear for my life you read about through the scriptures you know when we look in the scriptures and we we read about many heroes of faith and you think about men like such as we're reading about Gideon and you all know we've really been covering Gideon in the youth meetings but you read about Gideon you read about men like you Elijah you read about men like Moses you read about men like Peter you read about women like Lydia you read about like Mary like Rebecca you read about them and sometimes we miss it and we'd get to looking at it like what great individuals they were but I want you understand they were just common people just as you and I they were they were made up of the same elements that you and I are made up of but one thing that made them stand apart from the rest of the world in that time there's one thing that made Mary as a young lady stand out different from the rest of the young ladies and that's because that Mary in her heart she was separated unto God that the Bible says it like this that these men that different ones in Hebrews 11 it speaks of how that they themselves subdued kingdoms how does these individuals subdue kingdoms the Bible says it that out of weakness they were made strong Scott doesn't need and God doesn't take the strong I hope you're with me now God does not need somebody who's strong he needs somebody who's willing to be weak that he might be strong gun this is the kind of mighty men when God spoke to Gideon he came to Gideon I want you just to kind of get a backdrop on this he came to get in and he speaks to get in now look at where we're at now the Prophet has come in the beginning of Judges 6 the Prophet goes off the scene but the angel of the Lord follows the prophets message so the age of the Lord that descended down to bring the message when the messenger went off the scene he who was the inspiration the age of the Lord Himself was still present and now bringing that message to a personal reality to who it was intended to you understand there were things that were spoken where Israel just kind of went back into their into their ways they continued on you know life as usual they got out of Sunday morning service and everything just kind of resumed and let's see what were the things that I had to fulfill today Olli I got three alerts but there was something you see that God he's not interested in trying to reform us God knows that when he by his presence comes and begins to make himself known to you and I it's something that his presence to the heart of the believer will take precedence and preeminence over everything else God does not want us just to live by run-of-the-mill life and just to be something to where were just routine but God wants us to be the individuals that are inspired by the Holy Ghost that are set and directed by his spirit you believe that he comes to Gideon and here he approaches Gideon Gideon thinks he's an old man you ask me he thinks he's an old man Gideon don't know who he is but you see God has many masks God has many forms Gideon don't know and recognize who's speaking to him but here's the voice tells him and says thou mighty man of Valor get in no doubt did just like you and I would do we look around and say who else entered the room who else is in here besides me because you said mighty man of Valor because remember gideon himself was a coward he was a coward and so or were each and every one of us gideon the coward part about gideon even argued and said there's no way I'm gonna be able to do this he said my family's the poorest in Manassas complexes his complexes I don't have the genes that everybody else has I don't wear the same shoes that everybody else has I don't have the same kind of shirts God said I'm not interested in that I've come to speak to that which is beneath the Cour because the coward can never fulfill my word but you let me get behind that coward bad your skin and I will make my word come to pass God doesn't need strongmen dog just takes cowards and his tents and he takes him inside out and he puts himself and that's a great paradox here you've got a coward on the outside but here you got a mighty God on the inside hello God was looking deeper than what Gideon could see the Bible said it like this the Lord looked on him not him him him God was looking deeper when God is talking to me and you he's not talking to this guy here this guy gets offended this God gets upset this guy says Lord I'll not be able to do this I cannot go pray for kings and potentates I've only got a seventh grade education this guy the coward says that but God looks what's beneath the coward table don't raise up cowards he kills cowards and raises up his children by his mighty power Alleluia is Almighty God and let me tell you something like this you know if you were gonna Scout somebody else you're Matthew let's put it like this if somebody came up to you such as myself and I said I think you got good basketball skills now you know I never play basketball right I just play around outside and shoot and everything else but I travel I do have to do all sorts of things but you would look at me and you say how in the world how can you tell me about our potential in my life you ain't never been a basketball player right now if I start talking to you about football certain things I can see how you're doing this cut and how you're doing this you might start listening a little bit you with me like I might be able to say hey someday man I think you got skills you'll be able to step in and the computer parts and accompany man I'll tell you what you keep going in this language huh I think it'll be really good but you can look at me and say what language do you prefer Oh English and you're expecting me to say pearl Java or whatever more I don't know those kind of languages when my brother-in-law talks I just say yes sir uh-huh does it work all right but you see what it is you couldn't have no confidence because what it is I don't know anything about that but so it takes one to be able to know the potential that lays within one the only one who knows about mighty men is Almighty God it takes a mighty God to come down and identify there are mighty sons and mighty daughters beneath and behind that first it takes a mighty God to point it out that mighty God comes on the scene and he can let you know there is something within you that you never knew and you wondered why was I this way why was that that way but God Himself comes right down and lets you know this is why you've always been the ugly duckling this is why you've always been the odd one or the strange one it's because you can never fit in to these things but you are always a part of my program you are always a part of my plan I had you in my mind before the foundation of the world hallelujah the mighty God comes on the scene to call mighty men listen to me now you don't take a bunch of people to be a mighty man all it takes is you in God hallelujah that's all it takes is you and God I want you to think of this faith as we're talking about remember how the Lord brought it on son on Thursday or Friday night about our landmarks he talked about how the enemy would like to move have little infringment sand move things just a little bit he talked about our prayer life our dedication our personal dedication in our life then the Holy Spirit follows it up yesterday morning and begins to deal with the tents our lives our homes begins to speak about the responsibility for the oil now you look at it if you want to be better as a hunter you don't wanna be 100 E well let's just pretend with me okay maybe you're talking to your brother saying I want to kill a hundred and fifty boone and crockett deer I don't want that thing to walk out there broadside I want to be able to put the pin on it well you're not gonna you're not gonna get any encouragement by reading Better Homes and garden you're not I'm saying now I know you like food we're buddies on that right I know that and those those are alright for a certain time right it can build confidence for what Mama's cooking right pasta lead you and then potato balls I like but then ain't gonna build your faith for the bill to kill a big buck is it there's only one thing it's going to build you up you got to see images about this you've got to talk with somebody who's a hunter and you're going to read books about hunting right it's going to build confidence faith comes by hearing the word god it comes by hearing not just listening to but by hearing you see there's a lot of things within a service you might say I can't remember every single point cutting interested in you regurgitating every single point that's not faith that's just called a good memory this is not Sunday school where you get stamps for how much you can remember it's when God comes down and he speaks personally to you where your faith is not in man's words but your faith is in the power of God amen engaged speech your life and you know God spoke to me because there's nobody knows that about me nobody knows those thoughts but God but God has spoken to me it builds faith to take and look upon the word and to hear that word you might read it and say I don't understand everything God's not interested that you understand everything but understand God gives understanding just like the Holy Spirit brought out yesterday seek and ask him for it when I'm hungry maybe we almost lot need more young people up here to preach to when I'm hungry I don't just you know kind of look around and lay around on the couch or getting a lazy boy when I'm hungry let me tell you I start going my wife starts to knowing when I start wearing treads through the kitchen bumping around here she hears this cabinet door closed this fridge Raider open and this right here she knows this guy's hungry now i'ma tell you there's a certain time of the day and I can kind of tell it's time to eat sometimes I feel I could get cheated in winter time but I know there's a certain time of the day it's time for me to eat buddy and so I'm going through a place where I can eat and there's there's there's this when we were looking at it I'm gonna ask her honey the most important question of the day what are we having for dinner I'm gonna wait for just a second say depending on what it is it might be a little praise break going on but I want to know you see I'm gonna ask I'm not gonna sit around it's like if I'm over at your house and you say hey we're having dinner I'm probably going to come to some of y'all's house and I'll be on a fast before I get there by the time I get there because I know what I might be getting so I'll show up there and after a period of time I'll say hey what time we go eat would you say what are you saying I'm saying the Bible says seek after God you've got to ask God God wants you to ask him questions God is not shy about answering questions the way you get to know somebody is ask questions that don't mind questions questions don't fluster god that's a way for God to make himself known to you his love his care though repite God here they came up to this place here's Gideon he comes in to this place here God lets him know you need to get down there tonight I don't care how you're gonna get there if you didn't take one of your buddies to camp with you go but you need to get there I don't care if you you I don't care what you got to do if you got a set on the road with your other girlfriends I want you to get there because you need to hear this you ask me God wasn't worried but Gideon might being fear about Fuhrer or any of the rest of them he wasn't worried about that but God said you need to get there and you need to hear this pardon me somebody I need these monitors up a little bit more if y'all need me to change mic so will but I feel like I'm gonna can I love them I can talk like that my brother-in-law he'll pay me back later but what you think of this here they are in the midst of this time and here they are in this and they go down there and when they get and when they get down there I've always I've always marveled at this God knew exactly the time for Gideon to get down there God wouldn't like you and I say you know sometimes you try to do things that make people hurry up like we want to get the church earlier so I'm gonna go start the car go ahead it'll run longer God was not God I've already had the time arranged brother Joey he knew God just said I want you to get down there I don't care who you take with you because what God has confidence in Gideon needs to hear because sometimes you and I you cannot see what God sees in you you can't see it but God wants you to me want you to know this is what I see in you and I also want you to know the enemy is seeing this and you know the enemy ain't afraid of how many scriptures we know the enemy is not afraid that we say we believe the message or how many quotes but where the enemy is afraid of he's afraid of the Living God he's taking precedence in our life that's what he's afraid of he can prevail any day over our flesh over our thinking but he cannot prevail against that revelation that is tied up in your soul he cannot prevail against that go repeater god oh my god said i already have delivered it into your hand now I want you to think of this young people y'all ready for this here's a tenth here's a tenth down here and here's this tenth that's laying there and the tenth the Bible says that one of them said I seen a cake of barley bread rolling down now would you think about a piece of bread knocking over a tent no you look at that you think oh what Noel but remember God deals in symbols God deals in symbols he deals in symbols and it wasn't a piece it was a cake and one of the cake is it's round it means it can move it's not just stationary it's on the move the holy spirit inside of you is on the move it's moving you and it's a cake of barley bread you know barley is it represents resurrection power and here is this cake of barley bread it comes rolling down into the host tumbling down there it knows exactly where it's coming to that pit that's there that is of the leaders and of the hosts of media they're a whole encampment that has been upon the Israel God he's going to turn that around overturn it he's going to smite it and he's going to overthrow it and then the man that is listening there to the dream of his other fellow he says this is nothing else but the sword of the Lord and of Gideon you see the enemy had already heard about this oh I hope you're with me tonight you see Gideon had not lifted his sword per se against the Midianites yet he had never ever lifted his sword against the Midianites but what got Satan nervous is because get in begin to take care of things in his house God after the Lord quickened his seed his life there and remember the fire rose up out of the rock the sacrifice that was there has the fire rose up and consumed that same fire lifted Gideon into heavenly places and Gideon is spoken to by God go back to your house your daddy's house see these things have been handed down year after year after year after year and I don't want the old Bullock I don't want that old brittle thing that's lame and hardly get around I want the young one I want a tender heart a tender life I want one that's what I want you'll get the second one but tender when you see God just comes to claim and tenderize our lives so that what our lives might be an offering of it's a fresh offering tender to be flexible can be moved by the holy ghost you asked me he had to tear down the Grove the Grove all those trees he had to tear down the altar he had to come and do all of them before he ever lifted one finger against the Midianites but you see this is where we learn in the scriptures a very valuable lesson being obedient in small things you want to see I want to see bigger things be obedient and small things but I want to see miracles where are you at when it's Church time it's small things well I really want to see God move and you won't even ask blessing over your food oh I really want to see God move and you don't take time in your personal up whoo-hoo a pastor show back up here but you see it matters it matters how victorious do you want to be you can be as victorious as God has allotted for your life and let me tell you there is no in to victory but the devil's always after us to try to get us in a place to where we're not living to the full potential but here getting now God speaks to him and he's going to come and he's going to deal with these with these Midianites the Bible says it like this it says that when Gideon when he had heard this truly Gideon begin to worship how much you think of this there hasn't been one sword lifted but when God spoke Gideon said it's over matter of fact Gideon might have broke out in a song it's already done mmm it's already done the battle is over the victory has been won it's already done so what's wrong with that guy oh he already we got a word from the Lord it's already done and yet he noticed this Gideon just as some Scriptures before had talked to the Lord about that fleece if if if thou will deliver Israel by my hand if but after this he worships it's done and he comes back saying arise get up the Lord has delivered the Midianites into your hand see not my hand your hands you see the word it's a body movement this is not a one-man ministry anymore this is a body who God used one man that that revelation could be given but that revelation was for you and I that it might find its way in the heart of the believer he did his part the Prophet did his part now he prophet the Holy Ghost is on the scene he's bringing the word through a living reality in you and I and letting you know this is your part know how to act this out yes just watch I'll show you well how do I do it just surrender I'll act it out through you more than what wasn't one as it wasn't if the Acts of the Apostles no no it was the Acts of me in the Apostles hallelujah bro repeater God so here this cake of barley bread has it come down you think about faith let's come back to faith for a moment I know it's no mystery I don't use hairspray right I'm not gonna spray this on anybody but this just happened to be here they must have this up here cuz somebody makes a mess but you see these contents in here there's a way made to get these contents out there's a way mate now you know you can say why don't you just open the bottle and just dump it out but you know that won't work I mean you'll get the contents out but what a mess it would be but you see understanding is where you know the contents in this Bible or this bottle the contents that are in the word there is a release valve of the power contained in it and that what is that release mouth faith will press the release valve to where the virtue that's laying in the word can come right out to you remember when that remember when that woman was with the issue of blood remember she said if I came but touch the hem of His garment you see her faith it lit touch the release valve of the virtue of God and God's virtue went right out to her and her condition was healed in her right then you believe he's the same God this morning your faith is the release valve on the power of God so with faith when we look at this you think of how that it's so important in this time for us to be built up in faith that's the only way that you can face the the time the condition the adversary in this hour is to be built up in the faith of this hour you understand what I'm saying build up in the faith of this hour you can't be built up by just nibbling I'm doing some meetings last week and I got I got about through you know I'd went from Thursday night here and then went into some other other meetings right straight and started speaking by the time I got to that after that second night in that in that youth meeting man I was weak I was real weak and you know some of the things when I started telling my wife I said man tell the church to pray I got one more service here and I don't know how I'm gonna do it I was feeling really weak I mean I was really tired already but my wife sentence he text me back something I've saved this text she said you need to eat some carbs I saved that text man let me tell you what kind of carbs are you I had lasagna that day after I got done with lasagna I had a piece of pecan pie with vanilla icing or vanilla ice cream on top I took her word to the fullest let me tell you I feel a lot better brother Doug I really did I felt better my body because I just was eating the proteins and fats but I needed a little bit of that because of what I was expending I haven't I haven't taken it and been eating the carbs and things I think I only ate two piece of that stuff that sister Michelle made and hope she makes again very soon I only ate a little bit of that yesterday but because I couldn't come up with a good reason why I needed carbs but I'm talking about being built up in faith the faith of this hour you got to be able to be built up in that and allowing as the Prophet said that it would be accumulated in our lives all the things that he has been doing and you know listen friends this is about your life your journey your walk god this is personal between you and God there is so many experiences for your life but you can accumulate and realize my life is not my chance it's not by accident it was by the design of Almighty God that I am here that God has moved upon my heart God has drawn me to himself I didn't put this love inside of me this is from him this is no one I've tried to do it's what God has determined to do hallelujah because this is your act this is your time Emily it's like this right here you've got this part on the plane we're in the closing act of the drum and you know can you say me 10 and 11 years old how am I going to do this but don't look at your age don't look at what you can't do all you have to do is look to the one who's speaking to you so all you got to do he's the one to perform it through your life it's not you it's him he's the one who'll do it you agree with that come on hey man hey I'm brother Samuel get him buddy second saying man like you've seen going up yonder but uh nah here we go here comes Gideon now God tells him in this God said I'll tell you what here the trumpet is blown the Spirit of the Lord comes upon him and people are gathering from Asher Neff tell I believe in from a NASA and they come after Gideon they get all these twenty two thousand twenty two thousand men of water [Music] Gideon's looking all these guys coming twenty two thousand and it's all right twenty-two twenty-two thousand oh man this is good God said we need to narrow it down because when a trumpet sounds it calls three kinds of believers we got to narrow it down so here's what he tells gideon he said it so I want you to do I want you to go tell them that are that are afraid tell him to go on back home what a paradox he a chapter before was a coward a coward was telling other cowards no was a coward the mighty man had been raised up and the mighty man was putting the coward in subjection and he told those that are fearful faint-hearted go on back home sure glory be to God you think the devil one trying to booger him in his mind tell him and say I'll tell you what look at you one you the one hiding behind the winepress huh weren't you the one that this youth camp and this year's camp and this thing and then look at you get in knew that he hadn't met God face to face things were different and Gideon was resting in that difference that was me you see that's what you have to look for his look for the difference maker and the difference maker is the Lord God Himself Gideon was resting in this right here it didn't matter he had oh listen he went through some of the same man battles at you and I would go through you better believe it the devil was right there to point out all the reasons and try to point out everything but you know what Gideon was able to silence that because what God had said let me tell you something when God speaks to your heart that is a voice and that voice cannot be silenced when that voice finds its place in your heart it's hit its mark and that voice is greater than any other voice Amen that is the voice of the lion that's roaring and all other voices must cease because the King has spoken hello glory be to God amen brother Samuel I'll get him today here we go twenty-two thousand man twenty-two thousand here from twenty two thousand it goes down to ten thousand oh Lord I mean you could maybe five hundred just five hundred twenty one thousand five hundred that'd be alright well that wasn't her wiped out they go running but then here here get in here is he heard from the Lord and when get in here is from God God said still too many too many too many but wait a minute you don't find Gideon questioning Gideon doesn't know how God is going to separate everything out but remember there's a key point God is doing this because he said I don't want Israel to vaunt themselves against me as though it's my numbers I can spit quotes out like a Gatling gun I know how brother Ram says it here I know how to finish it there I could quote the last part I know the last song he's sudden the message good the devil does too this is not about memorization this is the word of the Living God that is come forth to put his people into action not where we become a bunch of intellectuals and can know this and I can quote this and quote that this word was made and meant to take on flesh because inside of you and inside of me was that corresponding part that when the water of life is released upon that seed it transforms and it released the mystery that had been sealed into your life and that's a mystery of Christ Matthew come up here a minute come up here yeah well you got to do is say a man brother Sammy I won't pick on you no more man this guy ain't getting tall in me every time he comes to my house I feel like I'm have to get a stepladder now here's the way it's gonna be we got all of these people in here and let's look at it like this you mean you and we're gonna play all of them in kickball what you think about that what you mean no you don't got much confidence huh why not huh too many it's a lot that's how that's what it was with Israel it went from 22,000 to 300 I'm not much into math myself but I did it and you know what the math is 300 divided by 20 mm its 1% God took 1% and God said with 1% you give me 1% and I'll whoop the devil you give me 1% God doesn't need numbers Oh mother Santa we want to fill this church up with what how about let our lives be filled up with God when I went on numbers numbers numbers this is why different ones when they said the faint-hearted they they ran macula when God County interested in numbers God doesn't need numbers to be victorious all he needs is yielded vessels then we talked about faith right which on my faith and faith we look back in the scriptures there's some examples back in the scriptures mm-hmm you take Elijah and Gaza gazes an early Rizer haze' gets up he gets his latte from Starbucks he walks out there and maybe he's got his croissant out to the side you know and gazes out there he takes a drink and he's looking man there's a lot of them here today hey I'm not a lick I needed to get more caffeine looking look around there's more oh goodness maybe I want to take a bite of this breakfast sandwich it'll help me I just know it will it's got all the nutrients in it it'll help me because maybe my eyes are just going bad I my beta-carotene might be off and takes a bite there's some more it's like the more caffeine the more he looks around him the more it is what in the world's going on and here's the Elijah Elijah he's waking up oh boy that essential oil looks good I had a good night I ain't talking about lavender I'm talking about the real essential oil he had some serenity it brought a calming effect it Eliza was there he woke up I there man oh good gaze like you Lassie Elijah come on come on look look look what look at all this around here Alaska comes out there you know I got one eyes wipe him to sleep oh well it was good last night man thank you Lord for refreshing okay hey hey there's more look at all this Eliza said dear Lord there's some more with us than there is with them now hazel looked at him and said what you been ordering what what kind of drink you've been drinking Alleluia Elijah had been drinking a special drink hallelujah I'll tell you what Elijah was lit up come on somebody hey many had liquid fire inside of him you know what I'm talking about even when generals and different ones tried to take you Elijah there was a fire that issued out but Elijah was able he said God opened the eyes of this this man that he might see and the Bible declared it was full not just sprinkled but it was full of the horses and the chariots and the angels of God you might walk into that classroom on Tuesday morning let me tell you something you're not walking in there alone amen the same God that spits to your heart and moves upon your life that same God is right there to make himself real make himself known to you personally you may not be able to see it but there's angels on the bookshelf hey where the Lord is his host is present also you say what must I do have an open willing heart glory be to God there's another guy I'm thinking about right now and this guy he was of the ripe old age of 80 now we got people in here that are kind of close to that so don't you saying what you think about 80 all right but here's a man by the name of Moses here's a guy who had been a good general right been a good generous guy had a lot of awards and things like that but he had God didn't want any of his awards God didn't want God allowed him to get all those awards and God allowed him to fall flat on his face because they say it wasn't about Moses strength you see it ain't about your strength when you look at trying to live a real Christian life and you look at it and say I just don't think I can do it you're right but remember that's the coward talking the coward can never fulfill the will of God but you just turn loose and say Lord what you're tapping on the inside of me what you're touching on the inside of me Lord Jesus let it be released in let it be released in me and here was a man by the name of Moses that we read about how once you think of this he couldn't talk it's hard to believe but he talked worse than me he stuttered it would seem like God would call somebody that least could speak he started it would seem like that God's not interested in the abilities you see God does this this is by design all of this is to give you an I faith that God takes all of our weaknesses but he manifests his glory through it he took one man and there was a one man invasion with him after he met God he goes right back down there to face what he run from or let me preach a little bit there Mountain things that you've run from but you meet God one time and you'll find yourself God prepares you in that moment to meet what you've run from he takes the scare be afraid the cowardness and he brings within you the strength of the Lion of Judah hallelujah he did that for Jacob think about this here's David and Goliath sometimes that ain't numbers you know what I mean twenty twenty-two thousand down three huh sometimes that ain't numbers sometimes it's just sighs you know what I mean it's just like sighs because a trail here is a trail here ain't sleeping is he oh come on a trail that's all right I don't mean to wake you ma can you come here a minute Hado how to get his shoes on I'll take mine off too if that helps him hey man you look sharp today buddy you know don't get caught out here come on up here I want them to see you okay here you stand right up here now this time yeah brother will you come over here come over here by the way brother women you know I love you buddy I'm just using you for example yeah you know who you're gonna represent who are you gonna represent David I love you let me give you a hug before I do this who do you think he's gonna represent a lie now look at this don't this look like a mismatch I mean you look at this right here for the way I'm go ahead turn around something see let me let me put you down here right now next thing that is a mismatch the odds are innumerable there's no way in the world you would say this little guy is gonna whip this guy but if you can see what's behind this guy right here there's a great big God standing behind a great big promise and they're wonderful and you know how I took down the giant right how'd he do it how did he do it how did he do it like this like that thank you god bless thank you sighs sighs so this one about numbers it's about science I mean my size I wouldn't even pick on brother William wrote grams said it like this concerning David and Goliath he said a man in his right mind would not even go pick on Goliath with a 3006 naturally speaking but this one about a natural battle you see Goliath will say in all sorts of things to try to rattle David's cage you ain't nothing but a ruddy youth why you don't tell me how many quotes you know I can't remember a lot of them but I do know thus saith the Lord I did know God speaks to me in services I know that and I know he speaks to me when I I'm reading in his word I I know he speaks to me through the message I can't remember everything but I know he's speaking to me then that's the power you go in that's the might you go in God is speaking to me I don't care how good of a stone slinger that David was it wasn't his steel David didn't say all right devil let me tell you something okay David you can come up out of your yoga pose okay all right devil chapter so-and-so scripture so-and-so chapter so-and-so scripture so-and-so the devil would have left right at him it wasn't about all that he remembered it's what God quickened to him and this is the same way God never looks in numbers you know God right now when you look at all that's gathered in this church this morning God can do more with just three people two people one people God can do more that is surrendered in his will then he can with 1500 this message was not sent for masses and multitudes I'm not excluding nobody it's sent for the elect and it is God that brings you and I into place of surrender and submission we cannot even do that on our own accord you with me you know that in the scripture it's God who brings us into into that place now think about how a new room of this is let me just let me move on here now think about it through the scripture of how that God he laid it out through the scripture that you're gonna chase your enemies he said when he told before they were in the land you're gonna chase your enemies he told him also he said five of you will chase a hundred and a hundred of you will chase ten thousand don't you see why it's so important to fellowship with people of like precious faith it increases your faith that's why brother Ram says associate with people that believe like you believe I don't want to so Satan nobody don't believe in divine healing I don't associate with nobody don't believe in the baptism of the holy ghost you understand I'm have to talk to him in the workplace but I want to so say we're believers I want to so said that men with people who believe that God is still God that's what I want associate with I want somebody when I'm down I'm going through something that can catch me call me and say let me tell you something mother Samuel God is still God he's still a comforter he's still a deliverer he's still a hero I want people and I want to be one of them people to you Alleluia I know I'm talking to some of you right here we've been through some battles we've been through things to where when doctors have said you might as well cut it off it ain't gonna do no good but when God stepped on the scene there's times where God has stepped on the scene he made himself known it wasn't man that did it got made himself known if God be for us who can be against us God takes the minority and he will whip the majority all the way through the scriptures a move of God is not about numbers because brother brems said it like this he said when Gideon it came to that place of the water I'm not gonna preach on that this morning but when it came to that place right there he said sometimes people wonder what is God doing when all this has taken he said but in those times God's building army to fight with God's building an army to fight with because he doesn't need numbers he just needs her rendered vessels that's why when you look across the Assembly in your own assemblies where you go when you look for God to move don't look upon other houses first you look for God to move in your life you want God to move it to your address he knows your address he knows right where you're living he comes right there and that's where you want God to move he's inside of you and through you lord I've got to move on here let's get to this place here in the scriptures I've got your Bibles go with me to judges 7/16 please well I didn't set my watch like brother Jesse did I just forgot here's God's answer by these 300 you're gonna smite him the Bible says in verse 16 of judges 7 he divided the 300 men into three companies you see understanding right here we don't have anything to wear God told him do this or God told him to do this God told him to do this but you see the wisdom of God is on the scene he knows how to we divide and we conquer you understand what I'm saying if God wanted to he could have us all living in a community together but we drive one another nuts be pulling blinds and locking doors and everything else you'd be trying to get out of the community and go God didn't want our lives to be lived in a communal way he showed that in the book of Acts he wanted it to start in Jerusalem but it's a go to the uttermost parts right God's put you right where he wants you you're a lot right where you are in the job where God has placed you in your family in your home God has divided to you you were portion you with me you believe that divided them into three companies look at this he put a trumpet in every man's hand with empty pitchers and lamps within the pitchers we're gonna go fight a battle with trumpets empty vessels and a torch in the vessel we're not gonna go defeat him like this yeah that's how we're gonna defeat him this is how we're going to beat him but see God didn't want a full vessel he didn't want a vessel there was even 10% for he wants an empty vessel you see this was showing what had happened there had been an emptying up of self this was a display of vessels that had been emptied up to the Lord and these weren't just any vessels these were fragile if you were to drop one of these vessels on the floor it would break that kind of sounds like me and you earthen vessels but it's not of our power its of the excellency of God's power so God places his life in the midst of an earthen vessel in the midst of a vessel that's so fragile that's what makes him so great he can become so small he can get inside of there and victory is manifest I wonder if Gideon you know getting was getting all these supplies together I wonder if Gideon was just singing a song around the camp Jesus we're dependent on you Jesus we're dependent on you Jesus we're dependent on coal now you can walk around in Molly Grubbs the Bible said look what Paul wrote by the Spirit of God that pertained all the way back there he said making melody in your heart come on now everyone of us can sing in our heads whether we can sing out here or not right we can all hit the perfect notes man where we're singing so you might not be singing out here but you might be in your car Jesus we're depending on you Jesus we're depending on you get the lamps Jesus got the trumpets were deep in there yeah I got the trumpets you got the torture yep we're depending on you to see us through you might've broke out in I got joy in my soul God is in control [Applause] [Applause] glory I am enjoying his presence nor a because this about me and you this about me and you I'm reading about me and you the mystery of why this message came right here you get in me you me this is why so here's what Gideon says he says I want you you take the trumpet in the right hand and I want I want the torch and I want the vessels I want them here in the left hand now here they are they're going to come up to the mountaintop and they're gonna their divining up they're going to encircle the camp 300 guys now remind you later on in another portion of the scripture the Bible tells us how many got defeated right here was about 150 thousand and there was still a host that fled but 300 circled them about you know God knows how to position you you might think you're in the disadvantage but let me tell you something with God on your side the advantage is in our favor I'll tell you right here this morning we've got the advantage we've got the advantage on the enemy yes sir as believers there's believers here this morning there's hearts that's been touched by God baptized with the Holy Ghost we have the advantage here this morning you believe that tell me you're with me we have the advantage because we are on the Lord's side they come to this place here they are here's the vessel the lamp it's hidden there in the vessel it CMD vessel you look at that vessel say that's an old ugly earthen vessel but you don't know what's behind here their fire behind there buddy there's a torch behind there and that torch it's a fire burning from Atonement I mean pitch here it is and they begin to blow Gideon says I want you to look on me and you do as I do they knew leadership get in here here he is they blow the trumpet the trumpet is blown they're declaring war and as soon as they declare that smash those pictures upon the earth and when you smash those pictures the fire that was always there burning that fire is now unveil let me tell you what this was right here this was them empty vessels coming out of the upper room where the flower of God had come down in vessels and now that fire was reflecting out through their lives let me read you a little statement here the brother branham made we're going to put the devil on notice here well Rams sending a message come see we know that all the enemies are gathering around they come just as close as they can and we put it to you like this and I don't say this to be funny the any meal come so close to you could smell his breath you know I was trying to do he's trying to rattle you remember he came right up to brother brems face spit right in his face and that was running right down brother brems face right the man made even another lunch but God was in control they come just as close as they can but we know see look at this we know seated in this building somewhere around in midair around the platform here are angels of the Lord decisions must be made we stand as a representative of Jesus Christ you willing to do that stand as a representative of Jesus Christ now Lord may the enemy be defeated now has promised to us that we should cast out evil spirits that's what you said and I believe that Lord with all my heart let thy word be truth and every man a lie and it may be proven here tonight that your power will be so predominant that every evil spirit that would try to enter into the person or into the building or that's got anyone bound may they have to turn loose and get away and may there be a shout of victory everywhere Lord may we break the picture tonight and let the fire fly break the picture and let the fire fly you know when that fire gets loose there was an earthen vessel we don't even know her name all we know of her woman at the will one of these days with random Dimitar we're gonna mean she no longer be the woman at the well we're gonna have we're gonna know a name but her life was you could look at and say boy what a mess her life was in but you see God knew what was down beneath there and here God had an appointment he knew her address he knew when she would show up to that well just like he knew when Gideon would get to that tent God had everything arranged it was all by design and when that moment as the word began to deal with her life she realized this man does not know me but there are things being uncovered in my life that only God knows you know it wasn't just him exposing her sins but but that same voice held within it was just something resonating deep this is what I've been longing for this is what I've been needed this is really speaking to the depths of my life I'll tell you that day her life got lit on fire she went back running into that city think about it her reputation was not good at all who would have listened to her but there was something different inside that earthen vessel there was a torch there was a lamp there was fire that had been lit and it was not her words that was streaming off but it was God right there behind those words and it made a witness and a testimony I tell you that city was turned upside down if I heard testimony let the devil try to put that fire out he can't put that fire out like the little ones son this morning he can't blow that out I'm gonna let it shine this little light of mine I'm gonna let it shine and the devil locked the border he can't blow it out you can't put out this fire this is not a man-made fire hallelujah this is not a church fire this is the fire the original fire of the Holy Ghost that same fire that came down there and consumed the sacrifice on Calvary that same fire that was sent back on the day of Pentecost that same fire that has moved down through the ages and returned in the end time as the pillar fire in fullness to inhabit and Tabernacle the bride body same fire of God think about this this is what God said in his word I want you listen to me now we come and we hear the word Satan and watch if we don't act upon that word he won't move a bit let me tell you like this brother brandman acts of the Holy Spirit he said when what took place on that upper room when those 120 were filled with the Holy Ghost they came out of that room then he said there was three thousand that was added you know where I'm at in the Bible three thousands was added that day he said that devil never even moved off of his bed parents you understand what I'm talking about sometimes you try to get them to move out of their bed now i'ma call them devils but you talk about your children you're trying to get him to move you know snooze snooze snooze snooze come on now I'm not the only one maybe some of you say hey you don't know me and then kids it's me some of you might have cooperated the copyright to the snooze button but the devil didn't even move out of his bed but that day at the gate called beautiful that day when the power of God here being releasing a man who was crippled from his mother's womb he that in that moment how a Peter and John they look said look upon us silver and gold have we none but such as we have give unto you rise up in the name of Jesus Christ that right there brother Graham said that type of devil fired up he said the devil got out of bed that morning you know what it is when the word when you're letting the word live and flow through your life that makes a devil move but the devil don't have brother been telling like this he said the devil didn't care how much preaching was done he didn't care he said I'll let him preach but he said I can't let that divine healing get loose I cannot allow that to happen because I won't be able to control it you know that's exactly the way it is service after service allowing the Spirit of God to really have the right-of-way in your life you want to say in your heart say Lord don't let me just set here Lord let me be put into action Lord let me act upon the word I don't want Hell to look up and the demons and say don't worry him he'll enter in and he'll leave out the same way but I want him to have a rapport inhale to say when this guy goes to house of God when this guy listens to the word he lets the word strip him down he lets the word clean him out he lets the word put him into action hey man not just he's able to go out and tell me everything that I preached on her she can tell me everything no we want the word to put us into action because when the word puts us into action let me tell you something there's a reputation that goes before you and it's not the reputation of you it's the reputation of a mighty God he said it like this he said I'll be an enemy to your enemies and he said I'll be an adversary to your adversaries you know what an adversary is it's one who brings distress God said I'll be an adversary to your head Viserys hallelujah think about it now when they came into the land those two spies went up there here's RAM they make a visit there and she lets him know we've heard we've heard what the Lord God he is God and you know what she said she didn't know the book of Deuteronomy she didn't know what God had said to them but she quoted word for word what God's desire was in the book of Deuteronomy he said that they may know that God in heaven is God in earth she declared that and she said as soon as the report came in to our city the hearts did melt now you might look and you might think me no no it ain't you it ain't you hitting me it's god but God takes vessels that are yielded to him he doesn't want numbers he just needs surrendered it don't matter how remember we looked at this it don't matter how big you are you don't matter how small you are you don't matter how long you been in the message or how short of a time you've been in the message what matters is is how the message is able to live through you does the Holy Spirit have preeminence in your life now coming down they start killing one another you know Devils boy they just didn't know what to do they just start turning on one another smiting one another and gideon they take out Gideon said this is full pursuit man we are not stopping here I hope you understand what I'm saying we're not just saying boy I tell you what man I feel really good no no you need to slay that guy don't just go I feel really good boy tell you what I feel really good I feel really really strengthen up no you need to slay your enemy so you got to go after that ruler because that ruler can round up more troops so here was the princess took out or a benzine their names mean Raven and wolf they take out because remember the Duff cannot come down on a raven the Duff cannot come down on a wolf a raven will eat anything Raven will eat o the Raven will say O Lord God praise the Lord and then the Raven could go out and eat all kinds of trash you see they got slay orab and Eva the Raven and the wolf that the death might come down you with me and here's the Kings the Kings kept going their names of Xia's it was a moon die the guys name but you know what their names mean deprived of protection deprived of protection you see what was really there was made known these guys that have been rounding up they had all these Midianites here they were all there and you know that's really what the devil is the devil his his protection has already been removed he's deprived of protection you know he cannot do one thing remember what faith is faith is a release valve if you get your heart set right now I don't care what it is that you've been battling what you've been fighting you might say well you know besides I already feel a little different don't you stop until that Kings head is lifted off of him don't you say I'll tell you what I feel pretty good it's not about your feelings you need to know that that Prince that's been ruling over your life or that King that's there you need to know his head's been lifted you need to make sure that your enemy is bad maybe it's a sickness that's been on you it don't matter what it is what form the devil comes in God is still God it makes no difference he's still the same God and God has equipped you even initially you might say even in my condition even in my situation listen God did not come here to bring a word of the perfect people he came to bring a word and minister to you this is your hour of deliverance this is your time this is your moment this is your season it's not something way off but God wants to take your life and you be the cake of barley bread to what God has anointed you to defeat in your life but devil that he's anointed you for had to be put under your feet he's the same God this morning you believe that you with me this morning how many how many say I'm ready to draw the sword got the trumpet in my hand hallelujah I'm ready for the Lord that my vests will be empty Lord let the vessel itself let it be broken that the fire itself might come forth I'm gonna do something a little different we're gonna have prayer how does feel in my heart we're gonna have prayer we're not here just for a good service God has spoke to us so clearly but we're here to set in our hearts to say this is not going any further you know those two kings they went clear across Jordan listen to me now they went across Jordan but Gideon said they are not getting away I'm going after it's full-on pursuit you feel that way don't just set on what home nah they're going what God has done but it's full-on percent the promises belong to you you don't matter what it is God is still God you're willing to recognize that be honest with God then you can spec God to move hallelujah whatever you need you need the Holy Ghost he's here to give it he's here to feel that life hallelujah he's here to raise up that ancient landmark bill repeater God a God who changes circumstances situation the God who does not even consider the innumerable odds but all that he looks at is his lives that can be surrendered to him that he can move let's pray as the musicians would come what Jesus Lord you know even in this service this time that we've had together this weekend never even considered all of the events that would take place never would have even crossed her minds I had no plans of speaking this morning Lord you know I tried I reached out to many offered different brothers Lord different ones many were already scheduled out different things even some that at their home churches said I can't do it I I'm already gonna be here I reached out Lord and I I know that you've arranged this this morning because the Lord within it all our hearts my heart in the heart of the congregation here or do we appreciate all your gifts oh how we we do Lord how you speak to us but we realize the Lord that in everything it's you that we need to hear from and Lord I believe God that were mature enough I trust Lord to where we can recognize and we can see how you move and arrange things in a real special way Lord as far as people Lord were as common and as simple of people's again I'm thankful for that I'm not proud of that board but I just know what I love just being around your children people that unlock precious faith but just believe Lord no down here in this this time that we have together there's hearts Lord Jesus they need a deliverance there's a need that's upon their life their heart Lord we're aware that you are the one to meet every need I pray Lord God here this morning and as you spoke to us throughout Europe your word brought from the youngest to the oldest I pray that God it would just be so resonating with in their hearts that whatever that request is that's upon their heart Lord but they can they can come and believe you to meet that need Lord to answer that question to dissolve that down Lord God hearts and lives that are that are here Lord that they need the Holy Ghost they need a real experience with you it's not something Lord to where it's it's looked down on but Lord what you have for them and they realize they need that I pray right now Lord I ask your God I bond every unclean spirit then Lord God would want to whisper Lord in their mind try to whisper in their heart and try to stir up that coward and say you have tried before you're trapped but Lord this is not about our efforts may that ring in their heart that it's not the efforts of man that has touched them but it's you or God they're responding to your call father I pray Lord God that right here may it be manifest in lives chains that have already been broken may be manifest in lives needs or God we're determined within the heart of the believer not something we are worked up in but by faith in your word your presence that is spoken so directly to our hearts that we are not going to leave the head of our enemy on his body but a lift that here that ruling Lord I ask in the name of Jesus Christ that you come Lord upon their faith Lord as their faith releasing Lord what they have need of Lord I ask it in the name of
