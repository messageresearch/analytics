[40:28] amen and
[40:30] amen amen I wonder if you'll turn with
[40:33] me to Lamentations chapter
[40:37] 3 I'd like to by the help of the Lord I
[40:41] just didn't feel we
[40:43] got into a place last week
[40:45] when looking on this with hope but I
[40:48] certainly enjoyed the word of the Lord
[40:50] and how the Lord brought it together um
[40:53] I had an opportunity to listen to the
[40:56] message there on Sunday that uh the Lord
[40:59] placed upon brother Stephen and my what
[41:01] a
[41:02] blessing what a
[41:04] blessing I was rejoicing with you and uh
[41:07] it rejoices my heart to hear you rejoice
[41:11] as well uh in the word of the Lord and I
[41:14] just uh I really appreciate brother
[41:16] Stephen I really appreciate his ministry
[41:19] and um you know just uh he's been a real
[41:23] real blessing to us here I know he has
[41:25] other places too uh but he's just just
[41:27] been a real blessing here and so I want
[41:29] to also say thank you uh for your
[41:32] prayers uh for us while we were away and
[41:35] ministering there and um uh the Lord
[41:38] just really just give us wonderful
[41:40] Services there with the young people and
[41:42] then on Sunday and uh some of you who
[41:45] know brother Mike walls um they just got
[41:49] a building and so that's after 32 years
[41:54] and um in this building they got they're
[41:57] going to to be busting at the seams even
[41:58] going into this building but it's a
[42:01] place at least that if you would think
[42:03] about even the DC area it's the the rent
[42:07] and where they were at is just
[42:09] absolutely uh just mind-blowing and so
[42:12] at least we allow them to build equity
[42:14] and um you know they'll be able to get
[42:16] everybody in but um uh you know
[42:18] everyone's really excited for that so I
[42:20] know that they're uh getting ready for
[42:22] that I think this maybe this coming
[42:24] weekend or right after that they'll be
[42:25] able to get into their building it's
[42:28] right outside of um Washington DC there
[42:31] and so um but they asked me to greet you
[42:34] amen and extend their greetings to you
[42:36] and U so we just we appreciate them and
[42:39] perhaps someday we can have brother Mike
[42:41] here brother Mike's just a wonderful
[42:43] brother just a wonderful we' known him
[42:45] for many many years and uh so U just a
[42:49] wonderful brother I I'm not going to
[42:50] take his Thunder and share his
[42:52] testimony but uh I've heard it a couple
[42:55] times of even how God arranged that work
[42:56] there
[42:57] uh but the boys were out we were there
[42:59] together on Sunday and they got a chance
[43:01] to hear the testimony of how God brought
[43:04] that all about I think those are
[43:05] wonderful moments because you can see
[43:07] how God just has everything just so
[43:09] divinely orchestrated and we believe
[43:11] that as Believers we we experien that
[43:13] but it's so wonderful when you hear even
[43:16] that testimony in someone else's life as
[43:18] well and so uh we just just want to say
[43:22] God bless you um let's just look here re
[43:25] very quickly in Lamentations chapter
[43:28] 3 and here Jeremiah is writing this I
[43:32] recall to my mind in verse 21 therefore
[43:36] have I hope it is of the Lord's mercies
[43:40] that we are not consumed because his
[43:43] compassions fail not they are new every
[43:47] morning great is thy
[43:50] faithfulness the Lord is my portion
[43:53] saith my soul that's right therefore
[43:57] will I hope in him the Lord is good unto
[44:02] them that wait for him to the soul that
[44:05] seeketh him it is good that a man should
[44:09] both hope and quietly wait for the
[44:12] Salvation of the Lord amen may God bless
[44:15] you and bless the reading of the word as
[44:17] you're being seated I I didn't include
[44:19] this but would you turn with me to Psalm
[44:21] 62 and I just want to read just a couple
[44:24] verses I I reference these last week but
[44:28] I want to just read him and then we'll
[44:30] just uh draw from there and right here
[44:33] in Psalm 62 this is where uh brother
[44:37] brandham he preaches uh the message
[44:39] Shalom he's drawing from this text and
[44:42] he you have a some time maybe to read it
[44:46] um a little bit later but I want to draw
[44:49] from here in verse one it says truly my
[44:52] soul waiteth upon God from him come
[44:57] cometh my
[44:58] salvation he only is my rock and brother
[45:02] BR was very clear to point that out in
[45:04] that he says that rock is a revelation
[45:07] to you personally of Jesus Christ he is
[45:11] my stabilizer my rock and my Revelation
[45:15] and my
[45:16] salvation he is my defense I shall not
[45:20] be greatly moved and look at this in
[45:23] verse three how long will you imagine
[45:26] Mischief against a man you shall be
[45:28] slain all of you as a bowing wall shall
[45:31] you be and as a tottering fence they
[45:34] only consult to cast him down from his
[45:37] Excellency they Delight in lies they
[45:40] bless with their mouth but they curse
[45:42] inwardly and think of how that Satan has
[45:46] tried over and over to tear down the
[45:49] kingdom of God to tear down the
[45:52] effectiveness of what the resurrection
[45:55] of the Lord Jesus Christ and the sending
[45:57] of the Holy Spirit among the Believers
[46:00] how he's tried to tear that away from
[46:03] the Church of the Living God but I'm
[46:05] grateful that God In His Infinite Mercy
[46:10] he sees to it that he have we have a
[46:13] visitation from him and in our lives
[46:16] he's not been torn down he's not been
[46:19] diminished to a Creed he's not been
[46:21] diminished to a a self-help but he's
[46:23] been lifted as a matter of fact the veil
[46:26] of who he really is has been removed
[46:30] from our eyes from our mind from our
[46:33] heart and we see him and we know him
[46:36] personally in our own lives as the
[46:39] mighty
[46:41] conqueror this is why then David could
[46:44] resume and say my soul wait thou only
[46:48] upon God for my expectation is from him
[46:53] he only only is my Rock in my salvation
[46:59] he is my defense I shall not be moved in
[47:03] God is my salvation and my glory the
[47:07] rock of my strength and my refuge is in
[47:11] God trust in him at all times ye people
[47:14] pour out your heart before him God is a
[47:18] refuge for us and I want to just drawing
[47:22] from that uh those places where our
[47:28] expectation is truly from him yes it's
[47:32] an expectation that is revealed and
[47:36] given to our hearts even as God
[47:39] sovereignly moves into our life brother
[47:43] Steven touched a little bit on this on
[47:45] on on Sunday about 34s through the
[47:48] message and he was dealing with how that
[47:50] it is the gift of God even God giving
[47:53] you and I the faith even to believe it's
[47:57] not something that we have mustered up
[48:00] on our own but it is God in his
[48:03] sovereignty you see that's what the word
[48:06] of God comes to let you and I see is
[48:09] that we're under the Sovereign working
[48:11] of almighty God and may God just help us
[48:14] to come into that place of looking to
[48:16] him with a faith and that he would just
[48:19] operate and perform his word and his
[48:22] promise to us and in us and through us
[48:25] this is the desire
[48:27] and so it's God who who gives you and I
[48:30] the faith he releases to inspire to you
[48:33] and I what is needed in this moment and
[48:36] in this hour this is why God when he
[48:39] sent this message in this hour it's for
[48:42] this moment to inspire a group of people
[48:46] that are built for this
[48:48] inspiration you you didn't you know when
[48:51] we look at it all the rest of them down
[48:53] through time have waited for this hour
[48:56] to come they've longed for it as a
[48:59] matter of fact the prophet himself would
[49:01] say I hope that I'm alive to see her
[49:05] when she puts on the Robes of his
[49:08] resurrection power he wanted to see that
[49:11] you see the prophet when he went off the
[49:14] scene he did not go off the scene with I
[49:17] I wonder if if this is going to work he
[49:19] had already not only seen it work it it
[49:22] had been proven but it was a faith to
[49:25] know that the word that God has spoken
[49:28] cannot fail Hallelujah and that's why
[49:32] this message itself it's not a movement
[49:35] it's not something that has been uh uh
[49:38] devised by man but it is a channel
[49:41] that's been open between God and the
[49:45] believer where all veils are taken away
[49:48] where the inspiration has come to you
[49:51] and I and that inspiration I'm talking
[49:54] about is the holy spirit is God's word
[49:57] in this hour to inspire you and I and
[50:01] how God in this in this time has come to
[50:05] deliver to you and I a real expectation
[50:08] Hey listen I'm standing here tonight I
[50:10] believe I'm one of them that's not going
[50:13] to taste death I believe I'm be looking
[50:15] at others here tonight you might say you
[50:18] don't know my condition it doesn't
[50:20] matter what your condition is I believe
[50:23] with all my heart I'm looking at a group
[50:26] of people
[50:27] on whom the ends of the world have come
[50:29] and we're standing with an expectation
[50:32] that just any moment somewhere even
[50:35] between now and even the next breath can
[50:38] come the very change of our bodies we're
[50:41] looking for our loved ones at any time
[50:44] to
[50:45] come Hallelujah I'm expecting that I'm
[50:49] looking for that this hour this message
[50:52] this word the Holy Spirit has brought us
[50:56] into to that place to look for the
[50:59] coming of the Lord so our expectation
[51:03] it's not something that's been derived
[51:05] from a man it's not something that we
[51:07] see how the world and in the best of
[51:09] their interpretation the ecclesiastical
[51:12] world and all of these things that they
[51:14] have of you know the Rapture and how
[51:17] it's all going to be but you know I'm
[51:19] thankful in this hour and I don't say it
[51:21] because that we're anything in ourselves
[51:24] but it's God's grace that is shown to
[51:26] you and I where we're no longer
[51:28] wondering what the next step is what's
[51:31] coming next we're no longer even
[51:33] standing back in a place where the
[51:36] Prophet was in the early years of the
[51:38] ministry and said we don't know what
[51:40] kind of body that is but God in this
[51:42] hour he took a prophet beyond the
[51:45] curtain of time why did he do that in
[51:48] this hour why didn't he do that in
[51:51] Luther's hour in Wesley's hour why
[51:53] didn't he do that at the outpouring on
[51:57] street because it wasn't the time the
[52:00] season or the hour God fulfills his word
[52:04] in season because it is when that word
[52:07] is being fulfilled it stirs the heart of
[52:11] those who are a part of that
[52:15] word God knows what he's doing that's
[52:18] right so here what a a a very a a a
[52:21] great key in this scripture this portion
[52:24] we've looked at in my hope is in the the
[52:26] Lord is that the Lord is the portion
[52:29] sath my soul he's my portion he's my
[52:34] portion he's he's my he's my inheritance
[52:38] he's mine who's saying this my
[52:41] soul not my flesh not my mind because
[52:45] sometimes your flesh your mind can can
[52:47] actually if you allow things to come
[52:49] there can bring doubt but you what's
[52:52] important is when your soul says the
[52:55] Lord is my ption
[52:56] [Applause]
[52:59] that's the anchor that's the stabilizer
[53:01] that's the one that pulls it all
[53:03] together as a matter of fact it's your
[53:05] soul that's the nature of the spirit
[53:07] it's the soul that God come to redeem
[53:10] he'll redeem the rest of it he's working
[53:12] right now to bring and subdue all things
[53:15] he will bring it all to a
[53:19] finish and you have that and I have that
[53:22] in my life that is a hope that rest
[53:25] within my heart within my life as it
[53:28] does in you that he will subdue all
[53:31] things unto
[53:34] himself and this hope as we have been
[53:36] looking at this hope it's what has been
[53:39] delivered to us a true expectation a
[53:42] trust that's been delivered to us by
[53:45] faith faith is the substance of things
[53:48] hoped for it's the substance right and
[53:52] this and by it the elders obtained a
[53:54] good report it's the same it's the love
[53:57] of God that brings you and I to a place
[54:00] to where not only can we bear All Things
[54:03] by his
[54:04] grace by his grace I don't have
[54:05] shoulders big enough to Bear it are you
[54:08] hearing me I don't have shoulders you
[54:10] don't
[54:11] either I don't have shoulders to Bear
[54:14] those things it requires something
[54:16] deeper than human love it requires God's
[54:19] love to be able to Bear it and to be
[54:22] able to believe all things that even
[54:25] when I can't see it when The Next Step I
[54:27] can't see it to be able to hope all
[54:30] things to trust in the Lord to even when
[54:33] let's say you come and you stand right
[54:35] here and we lay hands according to God's
[54:37] word according to God's word we lay
[54:40] hands on the sick and they shall recover
[54:42] that's his word and charity said I
[54:45] hopeth all things in other words we have
[54:48] done what the word has asked us to do if
[54:51] we confessed our sins the Bible said let
[54:53] them call for the Elders of the church
[54:56] let them confess all their sins
[54:58] anointing them with oil and the prayer
[55:01] the effectual fervent prayer of a
[55:03] righteous man ath
[55:06] much is that the word of God then we can
[55:10] walk out of there it doesn't matter what
[55:11] I feel
[55:13] like it doesn't matter if I felt
[55:15] anything or
[55:17] not I hope it's all
[55:19] things come on friends I'm trusting in
[55:23] Him because you know what he gave the
[55:25] word amen that's right God didn't call
[55:28] us to walk by sight he called us to walk
[55:31] by faith sight is not just here it's
[55:33] every sense that even is contrary to
[55:38] that of Faith anything that speaks
[55:41] contrary to Faith let it
[55:44] go is that right now I want to draw from
[55:48] this scripture here tonight in in Romans
[55:50] 15 verse 13 oh my notice how Paul would
[55:54] write of this now the God of Hope fill
[55:59] you with all joy and peace in believing
[56:03] that ye may abound in Hope through the
[56:07] power of the Holy Ghost so the god of a
[56:12] true expectation that expectation that
[56:15] is of a joyful and confident expectation
[56:19] of Eternal salvation the god of Hope
[56:23] fill you with all joy and peace in I'm
[56:26] glad that God he fills us with all joy
[56:31] and peace in believing I'm glad that
[56:34] there is one filling with many
[56:36] refilling because the very next part
[56:39] says that you may abound in hope in
[56:42] other words your expectation it doesn't
[56:44] waver but your expectation is to become
[56:47] greater your expectation in God's word
[56:51] that God is the god of his word he's not
[56:54] a man that he should lie every word of
[56:56] God is sure every word of God is amen
[56:59] our expectation abounds in the word of
[57:03] God why through the power of the Holy
[57:07] Ghost amen it's God lifting his word
[57:11] it's God raising the standard against
[57:14] the enemy and he's not raising it out
[57:16] here he's raising it in your life that's
[57:19] where the word is lifted to the standard
[57:22] to confront the enemy oh Hallelujah this
[57:26] is how Paul would write of this in first
[57:29] Timothy 1:1 Paul an apostle of Jesus
[57:33] Christ by the Commandment of God Our
[57:35] Savior and Lord Jesus Christ which is
[57:39] our
[57:40] hope so our hope is not a word a
[57:45] paragraph but our hope is a
[57:49] person amen now I want you to think of
[57:52] this let me read this out of Titus chap
[57:54] 1 verse one I love this oh my Paul a
[57:57] servant of God and an apostle of Jesus
[58:00] Christ according to the faith of God's
[58:03] elect and the acknowledging of the truth
[58:06] which is after godliness in Hope of
[58:09] eternal life which God that cannot lie
[58:13] promise before the world
[58:16] begin notice where Paul is taking us
[58:19] back to not to the beginning but before
[58:22] the beginning in the mind of God amen
[58:26] amen where our hope that's where our
[58:29] hope takes hold that's where the anchor
[58:31] is is to know that before there ever was
[58:34] atom dust or molecule before the devil
[58:37] was ever I was already you were already
[58:41] we were already Sons and Daughters of
[58:44] God hallelujah it was already
[58:47] settled your destiny my destiny was
[58:51] already
[58:53] settled this is how God address job with
[58:57] the present trial he was in he took job
[59:01] back to that hope he said where was you
[59:04] when the sons of God shouted for
[59:07] Joy Rejoice where were you at job and
[59:11] the morning stars were singing where
[59:13] were you job you know why cuz if he can
[59:15] get job connected back there where he
[59:18] was and to see that then job could look
[59:21] even at the trial and the circumstance
[59:23] that he was in and it breathed the whole
[59:26] into his life he already had a hope in
[59:28] his soul but job could stand right there
[59:31] and he could say I know my redeemer
[59:35] live amen the Lamb's blood that was shed
[59:38] and when his name was put on the book my
[59:41] name was put on it in the same time
[59:44] because I am identified in the character
[59:47] of Christ being revealed in this
[59:51] generation when his name is
[59:54] revealed I don't have my my own name we
[59:57] respond to his name because that's what
[1:00:01] we're in he called their name
[1:00:06] Adam we come under the name of Jesus
[1:00:09] Christ yeah we've had our other
[1:00:11] character yeah we've lived under that
[1:00:13] other character but he never came to
[1:00:15] redeem the Fallen character he came to
[1:00:17] raise up that character that was there
[1:00:21] on the inside the whole time
[1:00:26] that so good in Hope of eternal life
[1:00:30] expectation of eternal life which God
[1:00:32] that cannot lie promised before the
[1:00:35] world begin but hath oh I love this but
[1:00:39] hath in due times manifested his word
[1:00:43] through preaching which is committed
[1:00:45] unto me according to the Commandment of
[1:00:47] God our savior I'm going to I'm going to
[1:00:50] read this in the Amplified I about got
[1:00:51] lost on this one I'm going to read this
[1:00:54] on the Amplified so I won't have to
[1:00:55] break apart these words but I want you
[1:00:57] to listen this Paul a bonder servant of
[1:01:00] God and an apostle a special messenger
[1:01:02] of Jesus Christ the Messiah to stimulate
[1:01:06] and promote the faith of God's chosen
[1:01:09] ones and to lead them on to Accurate
[1:01:12] discernment and recognition of and
[1:01:15] acquaintance with the truth which
[1:01:17] belongs to and harmonizes with and tends
[1:01:20] to
[1:01:21] Godliness you say what does this word do
[1:01:25] this word that God has ordained to the
[1:01:28] faith of God's chosen elect which lends
[1:01:32] that to truth or godliness truth that
[1:01:35] lends to Godliness you say what what is
[1:01:37] it all saying it's saying that God in
[1:01:39] His Grace has sent forth his word in
[1:01:42] this hour and you have come in harmony
[1:01:46] with the music sheet the symphony that's
[1:01:49] being played out that part in this hour
[1:01:52] God has sent a word in this hour we've
[1:01:54] not been stirred up by man because if we
[1:01:57] got to we always got to have that man to
[1:01:59] stir us up Pump us up prod us up God's
[1:02:01] not doing that he never has use man in
[1:02:04] that way God comes by his word it's by
[1:02:08] his word being revealed that stimulates
[1:02:11] the people come on Church it ain't the
[1:02:14] music music is wonderful I believe in
[1:02:17] music it ain't the man I don't care how
[1:02:20] Dynamic he is or how much he stands here
[1:02:22] it ain't the man that'll do that it
[1:02:24] takes a revelation of Jesus Christ to
[1:02:27] stimulate your
[1:02:30] heart you say what do you mean if it
[1:02:33] takes a man it'll always take a man we
[1:02:35] got to have our certain man we got to
[1:02:37] have this certain preacher we got to
[1:02:39] have this certain one God has never made
[1:02:42] it that man is depending on
[1:02:44] man the prophet said you get too much
[1:02:47] confidence in a man he said watch God
[1:02:49] will let that man his Humanity will be
[1:02:52] shown why to get your faith back where
[1:02:55] it belongs
[1:02:57] come on Church oh man this this bride is
[1:03:01] not being led in a Rapture by man she's
[1:03:04] been LED in Rapture by the angel of the
[1:03:07] Lord himself the pillar of
[1:03:10] fire
[1:03:12] Hallelujah sometimes you might feel
[1:03:14] alone but let me tell you you're not
[1:03:22] alone my my my my look at the is resting
[1:03:26] in the hope of eternal life which ever
[1:03:30] ever the ever truthful God who cannot
[1:03:33] deceive promised before the ages of time
[1:03:36] began and now in his own appointed time
[1:03:39] he has made manifest made known his word
[1:03:42] and revealed it as his message through
[1:03:44] the preaching entrusted to me by command
[1:03:47] of God our
[1:03:49] savior Hey listen let me just say it
[1:03:52] like this brother BR you can look at
[1:03:54] many and there is different things that
[1:03:57] you can catch where people will talk
[1:03:59] about brother bram's Ministry they'll
[1:04:02] talk about the signs they'll talk about
[1:04:04] the Wonders but the prophet would say it
[1:04:07] like this in voice of the sign he said
[1:04:09] if they can see those scriptural signs
[1:04:11] remember what voice is following that
[1:04:14] sign if that voice is the same old Trend
[1:04:17] that did not come from God to bring a
[1:04:22] Revival is that right but notice the
[1:04:25] prophet would say like this he said if
[1:04:27] God he sends a word and people can
[1:04:30] recognize he said oh the signs and the
[1:04:33] Wonders being done can't they recognize
[1:04:36] Malachi's voice also being car being
[1:04:39] spoken out through the word that's being
[1:04:42] fulfilled I I say it in this way not not
[1:04:46] throwing anybody else off because nobody
[1:04:48] can help be what they are but you and I
[1:04:51] that by God's grace there is a part that
[1:04:53] will lays Within You and I that this
[1:04:56] message is more than signs and wonders
[1:04:59] it was more than just what was done on
[1:05:01] the platform we recognize and catch who
[1:05:05] it was that was in our midst and not
[1:05:07] only who it was but we see ourselves in
[1:05:10] the book to where that the book has been
[1:05:13] open to you and I and we recognize
[1:05:15] ourselves as Sons and Daughters of God
[1:05:18] that's what this message come to
[1:05:21] do it came to bring us to where that our
[1:05:24] hope is in the Lord
[1:05:27] and that the soul can say my portion is
[1:05:30] the Lord sayith my
[1:05:32] soul this is why that it means something
[1:05:35] to you this is why over and over as the
[1:05:37] prophet would say that ASE being
[1:05:39] predestinated you can't help but see it
[1:05:42] he would say oh God flash across this
[1:05:45] Lord he said all I can do is preach the
[1:05:47] word he said and when I preach the word
[1:05:50] he said God it's you flashing the light
[1:05:52] across the seeds if there's a seed there
[1:05:55] it'll catch it stay with me now it might
[1:05:58] take a little bit of time but just
[1:06:00] because time goes on there's not
[1:06:02] diminish there's not seed so what are
[1:06:03] you saying don't write nobody
[1:06:07] off don't write nobody off let me tell
[1:06:10] you something you say brother Samuel
[1:06:12] let's just let's just take it what
[1:06:13] brother BR said if I prayed he said for
[1:06:16] 10,000 people tonight on the platform he
[1:06:19] said and every one of them died tomorrow
[1:06:21] morning I would be right back on the
[1:06:23] platform tomorrow night praying for the
[1:06:26] next 10,000 how can he say that because
[1:06:29] he's trusting in God in his
[1:06:33] [Applause]
[1:06:34] word understand that sometimes there's
[1:06:37] things that don't go the way that we
[1:06:39] would like it to go or or would like to
[1:06:42] see it happen a desire to see every one
[1:06:44] of those people healed but it doesn't
[1:06:46] take away from God's
[1:06:49] word come on can we preach now sometimes
[1:06:53] when we don't see things maybe happening
[1:06:54] the way that we think they ought to
[1:06:56] happen we're ready to look around and
[1:06:58] blame somebody else and try to find
[1:07:01] blame that's good but you see that don't
[1:07:03] do that that that what that does that
[1:07:05] suppresses there being any hope in our
[1:07:08] life remember how brother Steven was
[1:07:10] bringing that well how the Lord was
[1:07:11] bringing that at the end we want to
[1:07:13] remain clear channels unto God when
[1:07:16] there's things that don't happen the way
[1:07:18] that we think it ought to happen say
[1:07:20] Lord we're looking at our lives as
[1:07:22] channels that are available and open
[1:07:24] unto you Lord yes oh my God help us
[1:07:28] notice this hope that has been delivered
[1:07:31] to us Paul would would speak of this
[1:07:33] hope in the book of Colossians as the
[1:07:35] riches The Riches of the glory of this
[1:07:38] mystery being Christ in you the hope of
[1:07:42] glory the expectation it's him in us
[1:07:46] that gives us a true
[1:07:50] expectation is that right now notice
[1:07:52] Galatians 5:5 for we through the Spirit
[1:07:56] wait for the hope of righteousness by
[1:07:59] faith through the spirit not because of
[1:08:03] what we have done but because what the
[1:08:06] spirit has done and is working in our
[1:08:09] lives through the spirit we wait for the
[1:08:12] expectation of righteousness by faith
[1:08:16] faith has handed into our lives and
[1:08:20] expectation this is why right out of
[1:08:22] this service tonight that no matter what
[1:08:24] your need is you should come with you
[1:08:26] know come with an expectation how do I
[1:08:28] come with an expectation be praying
[1:08:30] before you get here even praying while
[1:08:32] you're driving in the car praying while
[1:08:34] you're sitting right there while the
[1:08:36] word is coming forth Lord Jesus you know
[1:08:39] Lord I need a word from you Lord God I
[1:08:42] need a touch from you tonight Lord I
[1:08:44] need a word to come down my way Lord I'm
[1:08:46] coming here tonight I pulled up
[1:08:48] underneath your table if you don't give
[1:08:50] me a whole loath I will take a crumb
[1:08:53] Lord because I know where that crumb
[1:08:55] come from it come from the loaf and if
[1:08:58] I'll take the crumb oh I'm not ashamed
[1:09:01] to be a crumb Seeker the prophet said it
[1:09:03] like this in perseverance 1964 he said
[1:09:06] are you afraid to be a crumb Seeker he
[1:09:09] said oh if you can just take a crumb
[1:09:11] remember it has within it the same
[1:09:14] qualities that are in that loaf of bread
[1:09:17] he said maybe God will give you a crumb
[1:09:19] and you've got a promise and you'll take
[1:09:21] that promise you will begin to cherish
[1:09:23] that promise you will begin to water
[1:09:26] that promise and begin to thank God for
[1:09:28] that promise he said that's a real crumb
[1:09:30] Seeker that says Lord oh I will take the
[1:09:34] crumbs that fall from your table I'm not
[1:09:37] here to demand anything from you I'm
[1:09:40] just here because I know and I am
[1:09:42] convinced that this word is the truth
[1:09:45] I'm convinced that I am a believer I am
[1:09:48] sure that the Holy Ghost is still real
[1:09:52] still alive I'm ass sure that healing
[1:09:54] belongs to me Deliverance belongs to me
[1:09:58] and I'm here to get my crumb if you give
[1:10:00] me a slice I'll take it if you give me a
[1:10:03] loaf I'll take it but if all you lets
[1:10:05] fall a crumb I'm going to take
[1:10:09] that
[1:10:13] amen thank you Lord watch how the
[1:10:15] prophet says it like this in the message
[1:10:17] thy house he said our heavenly father
[1:10:20] we're so glad for Jesus Christ Our Lord
[1:10:22] who saved our souls from a life of sin
[1:10:25] and has made us the citizens of his
[1:10:27] kingdom by his grace we are saved and
[1:10:31] that not by oursel or by our works but
[1:10:34] by his Mercy we are saved and we're so
[1:10:36] glad of that we know that someday we'll
[1:10:39] see him for we'll have a body like his
[1:10:42] own body and we'll see him as he is at
[1:10:45] this time yet we do not know how that
[1:10:48] will take place but it's not for us to
[1:10:50] know we'll only look forward to it by
[1:10:53] faith and the whole walk is Faith
[1:10:57] Hallelujah so good hopeth all things
[1:11:01] trusting notice here we have this this
[1:11:06] anchor this anchor that entereth within
[1:11:09] the veil this anchor that we have this
[1:11:13] hope that we have in Jesus Christ when
[1:11:17] when he has come and his word has look
[1:11:20] look he's already confirmed his word
[1:11:23] remember Paul said that he he not only
[1:11:25] made the promise but he there in Genesis
[1:11:28] 22 he swore by himself he not only had
[1:11:32] promised the word but now he stepped
[1:11:34] forward by two immutable things he spoke
[1:11:37] the word and then he swore by himself
[1:11:40] cuz there was nobody greater to swear by
[1:11:43] you know what God was committing himself
[1:11:45] to his word two immutable things and now
[1:11:48] that same God what he promised he has
[1:11:52] confirmed by his word with the coming of
[1:11:55] of the Holy Spirit and sealing that in
[1:11:57] our hearts to where there is an anchor
[1:12:00] that same hope we have as an anchor that
[1:12:04] enters within the veil you ever think
[1:12:06] about what an anchor does man I know
[1:12:08] there's Boatman in here you had you put
[1:12:10] down an anchor you do not see where that
[1:12:12] anchor glasp or grasp but there is a
[1:12:15] reality that that anchor no matter what
[1:12:18] waves no matter what Storms Come that
[1:12:20] boat or that vessel is held right in
[1:12:23] place this is why that no matter when a
[1:12:26] doctor's report comes or a situation
[1:12:29] arises and it could try you know to come
[1:12:32] against you it could try to move upon
[1:12:34] your mind fear could try to come in but
[1:12:37] this is where the scripture or the song
[1:12:39] I pray God helps me to get it right my
[1:12:41] hope is built on nothing less than Jesus
[1:12:44] blood and righteousness when all around
[1:12:47] my soul gives way then he alone is my
[1:12:51] hope hand
[1:12:52] stay you got an anchor that within the
[1:12:55] veil and the doctor said this is what
[1:12:58] your expectation is but we've got an
[1:13:01] expectation that looks beyond that it's
[1:13:04] an expectation in the veil it's an
[1:13:06] expectation that said whosoever
[1:13:08] believeth in me shall never die we've
[1:13:11] got an expectation that we have already
[1:13:14] passed from Death unto life we've got an
[1:13:16] expectation by the Forerunner who said
[1:13:19] by my stripes ye are already healed and
[1:13:22] expectation I'm the Lord that Healers
[1:13:25] all thine diseases that is the anchor
[1:13:27] I'm tied to it you and the word are not
[1:13:30] two separate things there's an anchor
[1:13:32] you're yoked with this
[1:13:35] word within the
[1:13:38] [Music]
[1:13:39] veil within the veil sure we feel the
[1:13:42] waves sure we feel the waves sure
[1:13:45] there's things that can come mind
[1:13:47] battles sure there's thoughts that can
[1:13:48] come but there's an
[1:13:51] anchor it's a hope it's the expectation
[1:13:55] I I am trusting in the Lord tell me how
[1:13:57] he's going to get you out of it I don't
[1:13:59] know how he's going to do it but I know
[1:14:01] it'll be by his
[1:14:03] [Applause]
[1:14:06] word that's right that's real trust in
[1:14:09] the
[1:14:11] Lord hallelujah I want you to think of
[1:14:14] this in Romans 8 oh my let me try to get

[1:14:19] earnest expectation of the creature

[1:14:27] groaning Hey listen the birds and the
[1:14:30] the Earth itself the volcanoes the
[1:14:33] earthquakes the they're
[1:14:35] waiting for the sons of God they're
[1:14:37] longing for the sons of God to come back
[1:14:40] in to control and
[1:14:43] manifestation God gives a little
[1:14:45] foretaste I said God gives a little
[1:14:47] foretaste even right now that's right
[1:14:50] hallelujah hallelujah there's a little
[1:14:52] foraste working in your life right now
[1:14:55] you and I this body is made up of
[1:14:57] elements of the earth and God has given
[1:15:00] you a greater power and authority on the
[1:15:03] inside as a son and daughter of God by
[1:15:06] the new birth that you now no longer are
[1:15:09] moved about by the prince of power of
[1:15:11] the air but now here you are as a
[1:15:13] manifested Son of God living in this
[1:15:17] Mortal
[1:15:19] body and when your mortal body wants to
[1:15:21] tell you something you're the one who
[1:15:23] stands there with jurisdiction and
[1:15:25] authority and said get out of my way
[1:15:28] Mountain get out of my way mountain when
[1:15:31] complexes want to stand there and say
[1:15:33] but that get out of my way Mountain you
[1:15:36] know what you're doing you're exercising
[1:15:38] your Authority it ain't going to
[1:15:40] diminish it's only going to increase
[1:15:43] from now to the change of the body and
[1:15:45] then into the
[1:15:47] Millennium
[1:15:49] hallah oh friends that's what this word
[1:15:51] come to do it in it gave you and I an
[1:15:55] authorization to live as Sons and
[1:15:58] Daughters of God you don't got to ask
[1:15:59] the devil you don't got to ask mom and
[1:16:01] daddy you don't got to ask the pastor
[1:16:04] God himself is the final voice of
[1:16:06] authority the amen has spoken and called
[1:16:09] you to live as a manifested Son of God
[1:16:13] your expectation is in
[1:16:16] him how's it going to be that's not for
[1:16:19] you to figure
[1:16:20] out
[1:16:23] hallelujah hallelujah when that word
[1:16:25] drops down when that word is settled
[1:16:27] down there and there's things sometimes
[1:16:29] that come across your lips and you think
[1:16:31] where did that come from I'll tell you
[1:16:33] where it come from it came from the
[1:16:35] portals of Glory it sovereignly moves
[1:16:38] down and there's an expression out of
[1:16:40] your lips you want to know how Isaiah
[1:16:42] felt when he said behold a virgin shall
[1:16:44] conceive that's exactly how he felt
[1:16:46] sometimes we wonder how did that come
[1:16:48] out but what it was inspiration dropped
[1:16:53] down yes sir Hallelujah Lord have
[1:16:59] mercy Romans 8:20 for the creature was
[1:17:02] made subject to vanity not
[1:17:05] willingly right but to re but by reason
[1:17:09] of him who hath subjected the same in
[1:17:12] Hope or of this expectation God has
[1:17:16] given you and I an
[1:17:18] expectation he made a way remember he
[1:17:21] could not make Adam and Eve willfully
[1:17:23] sin put them on free moral agency God
[1:17:26] knew had knowledge of what the choice
[1:17:29] and what they would be remember but when
[1:17:32] they made that choice it did not hinder
[1:17:35] God whatsoever that's right as a matter
[1:17:38] of fact like the great Diamond inside of
[1:17:41] this great Diamond was every attribute
[1:17:45] if there had never been a fall there
[1:17:46] would have never been need of the
[1:17:48] attribute of Savior if there had never
[1:17:51] been a fall it would never been a need
[1:17:53] for an attribute of Redeemer a deliverer
[1:17:55] so forth this is why the prophet could
[1:17:57] say in the church ages he said it was
[1:17:59] the fall itself that gave him reason and
[1:18:02] purpose of being Hallelujah I'll tell
[1:18:05] you right now tonight I'm sitting here
[1:18:07] tonight and even the needs in my life
[1:18:09] and your life it gives him reason and
[1:18:11] purpose of being and let me just say it
[1:18:14] like this I love how the prophet lays it
[1:18:16] out he said many times he said it's
[1:18:18] preached as though that once he saves us
[1:18:21] he loses interest in us he said but that
[1:18:23] is not the case whatsoever he's walking
[1:18:26] in the midst of the golden candlesticks
[1:18:29] a matter of fact he said he is the
[1:18:31] sustainer of his new creation he is
[1:18:35] actually governing even in the Affairs
[1:18:37] of man right now he's watching over
[1:18:42] us
[1:18:45] my watch's this because the creature
[1:18:47] itself also shall be delivered from the
[1:18:50] bondage of corruption into the Glorious
[1:18:53] Liberty of the children of God God
[1:18:55] aren't you glad for those little for
[1:18:56] tastes right now aren't you glad those
[1:18:58] for tastes that spills over in a service
[1:19:00] or we're in prayer or maybe you're rid
[1:19:02] in your car and you get that little that
[1:19:04] little foretaste that spills over my you
[1:19:06] just feel so liberated I mean you don't
[1:19:08] need autopilot right then I mean you
[1:19:11] you're you're right there driving along
[1:19:13] maybe you're walking down the store
[1:19:14] maybe you're laying in your bed maybe
[1:19:16] you're right here in church maybe you're
[1:19:18] praying in your closet but my how those
[1:19:20] four tastes of Glory will just spill
[1:19:22] over you say why would God do that that
[1:19:25] to encourage you and I he knows we need
[1:19:28] time from time we need Divine
[1:19:31] encouragement and God knows just how it
[1:19:33] to give you and I that encouragement I'm
[1:19:35] grateful for that aren't
[1:19:37] you it makes us appreciate it so that it
[1:19:40] don't become common to us Lord verse 22
[1:19:43] we know that the whole creation granth
[1:19:45] and travaileth in pain together until
[1:19:47] now not only they but ourselves also
[1:19:49] which have the first fruits of the
[1:19:52] spirit even we ourselves grown within
[1:19:55] ourselves waiting for the adoption to Wi
[1:19:58] the Redemption of our body what has
[1:20:00] brought this groaning now this groaning
[1:20:02] is not for the newest style this
[1:20:05] groaning is not for the newest AI
[1:20:07] technology this groaning is not for you
[1:20:10] know it's nothing wrong friends with
[1:20:11] having plans in life even young people
[1:20:13] nothing wrong with having plans but just
[1:20:15] just be sure that like James if the Lord
[1:20:21] Wills that it's always place that of all
[1:20:24] the plans that I have but Lord if you
[1:20:27] see fit to interrupt them
[1:20:29] yes then give me the grace to walk
[1:20:32] through that Interruption and to accept
[1:20:34] it is that right give me the grace in my
[1:20:37] Humanity Lord because right here in my
[1:20:39] soul I want your will more than anything
[1:20:41] else sometimes my flesh will think
[1:20:44] things are the will of God this will be
[1:20:45] so perfect but the soul itself that's
[1:20:47] who I want to give the right away I want
[1:20:49] that soul to have the right away because
[1:20:51] my flesh can lie to me it's only limited
[1:20:54] to these senses but we as children of
[1:20:56] God are not called to walk by these
[1:20:58] senses we are called to walk by that
[1:21:01] super sense that sense of faith and you
[1:21:04] know what will always accompany faith it
[1:21:06] will always be the dove of the holy
[1:21:08] spirit that will accompany Faith it'll
[1:21:11] give you perfect peace and perfect
[1:21:15] rest my Lord
[1:21:17] Jesus we're looking for that Redemption
[1:21:20] of the body that's what we're looking
[1:21:22] for I don't know about you but every
[1:21:24] pain and whatever more there's you know
[1:21:26] I know I'm only 48 years old I'm just a
[1:21:27] young guy right now but sometimes
[1:21:29] there's certain things right now that
[1:21:31] I'm beginning to understand what the
[1:21:32] older one said sometimes oh I you know
[1:21:35] took a little bit to to get up this
[1:21:36] morning had to stretch and had to do
[1:21:38] this you know before I I never knew what
[1:21:39] that
[1:21:41] meant I never knew what some of those
[1:21:43] things meant of where you stand up and
[1:21:44] you got to wait for everything to catch
[1:21:46] up you might say you're only 48 years
[1:21:48] old well you need to pray for me a whole
[1:21:49] lot more
[1:21:51] then hallelujah cuz I I don't want walk
[1:21:54] around five gallon buckets of arthritis
[1:21:56] cream but you understand there's things
[1:21:58] that we and ourselves we we we we look
[1:22:00] at them my my Lord what's happening but
[1:22:02] you know what God allows that to happen
[1:22:04] even sickness that comes in our way you
[1:22:06] know when sickness comes your way my
[1:22:08] goodness you almost forget what it's
[1:22:10] like to feel
[1:22:12] good right I mean we appreciate all the
[1:22:15] Pamper and the chicken noodle soup and
[1:22:17] all that stuff but you forget what it
[1:22:18] feels like you and yet there's a part of
[1:22:20] it I want to get Beyond this I want to
[1:22:22] get back to that
[1:22:26] oh my aren't you glad that there's
[1:22:27] something inside of you there's a
[1:22:30] longing inside of you to get back to
[1:22:33] that
[1:22:34] reality oh friends you and I would never
[1:22:37] have known where to look but God came
[1:22:39] and found you and I we are part of this
[1:22:42] Redemption and God has put that
[1:22:45] expectation in your heart in my heart
[1:22:47] I'll tell you if you don't have that
[1:22:49] hope tonight I'd settle it right here
[1:22:51] tonight and say God I want that
[1:22:53] expectation right here tonight
[1:22:56] Lord for we are saved by hope but hope
[1:23:01] that is seen is not hope so if you see
[1:23:03] something if you see it then you're no
[1:23:05] longer expecting
[1:23:07] it right because you see it right for
[1:23:09] what a man seeth why does he yet hope
[1:23:11] for it if he sees it he's no longer
[1:23:13] expecting it but if we hope for that we
[1:23:17] see not then we do with patience wait
[1:23:21] for it
[1:23:24] I tell you that's a
[1:23:26] paradox this guy's impatient this first
[1:23:29] birth is the result of
[1:23:32] impatience Pride not waiting on God
[1:23:35] that's right that's good come on is this
[1:23:37] guy look look how many times there in
[1:23:39] scripture they that wait on the
[1:23:41] Lord David would even have David would
[1:23:43] have personal conversations they
[1:23:45] probably thought David man this guy
[1:23:47] talking to himself no David knew what he
[1:23:48] was doing my soul waiteth on the Lord my
[1:23:50] soul why are thou disquieted within me
[1:23:53] my soul why are thou cast down
[1:23:55] David understood the Realms of his
[1:23:58] Tabernacle are you with me he understood
[1:24:01] that oh my friends you see God brings
[1:24:03] you and I that's what this message come
[1:24:05] to reveal even to you and I who the real
[1:24:08] son and daughter of God is this like we
[1:24:10] said last week this is only the screen
[1:24:13] that allows the real son and daughter of
[1:24:15] God to be expressed
[1:24:20] upon sometimes though our feelings we
[1:24:22] make our feelings as though that's the
[1:24:24] ultimate and if we make our feelings the
[1:24:26] ultimate it'll
[1:24:28] show come on we've all been there and
[1:24:31] we're all going to have to battle with
[1:24:32] that and subdue that but let I'm looking
[1:24:34] at Overcomers right here you might not
[1:24:37] think that that's a very big thing but
[1:24:39] it is a great big thing in this hour for
[1:24:41] a people of God to subdue and subject
[1:24:44] their own feelings when they stand face
[1:24:46] to face with God's word to be able to
[1:24:49] stand there and say my feelings they
[1:24:52] might be ever so real but God's word I
[1:24:55] place it above my
[1:24:59] feelings is that right God is establish
[1:25:02] listen friends god holds his word as
[1:25:05] David said thou has manifested Thy word
[1:25:08] above thy name you see because God knows
[1:25:11] if he don't keep his word he doesn't
[1:25:13] keep his name but his name is tied to
[1:25:16] faithfulness his name is tied to
[1:25:18] merciful his compassions fail not why
[1:25:21] cuz he keeps his word god God's never
[1:25:25] ever ever been indebted to nobody for
[1:25:28] any word he's never had to send out an
[1:25:30] IOU he's never had an overdrafted
[1:25:34] promise but God's promises are just as
[1:25:37] sure yay and amen
[1:25:40] tonight glory be to God Jeremiah knew
[1:25:44] this expectation that's why he could say
[1:25:47] the
[1:25:50] Lord is my portion saith my soul
[1:25:54] therefore my hope is in the Lord you
[1:25:57] know God Jeremiah his message as he was
[1:26:00] expressing I I don't have time to go
[1:26:01] through all the scriptures here tonight
[1:26:04] but Jeremiah over and over he said oh
[1:26:07] they that look up under the hills and
[1:26:09] waiting for all these things truly their
[1:26:10] hope is in vain but oh Our Hope Israel
[1:26:14] is of the Lord he is our hope he is our
[1:26:19] Salvation in the midst of judgment in
[1:26:22] the midst of judgment God God gave a
[1:26:25] message of
[1:26:27] mercy and God look look here when
[1:26:30] Jeremiah this is being expressed in
[1:26:32] Lamentations Jeremiah had a witness and
[1:26:35] it wasn't just something that was spoken
[1:26:37] but God not only revealed his word but
[1:26:39] he vindicates it and Jeremiah was
[1:26:41] instructed by God to go and buy the
[1:26:44] partial of land that belongeth to thine
[1:26:46] uncle and I want you to make that that
[1:26:49] that would be contained I want an open
[1:26:52] Declaration of the sell and I want one
[1:26:54] also to be sealed up and put in an earn
[1:26:57] vessel why would that be because whoever
[1:27:00] tampers with the open one it don't mean
[1:27:02] this it don't say this the property
[1:27:04] lines are here they can do all of that
[1:27:06] they can tamper with this but when that
[1:27:08] which was sealed up is broken it has
[1:27:11] within it the original boundaries it has
[1:27:14] within it the original Glory it has
[1:27:17] within it all the original promises come
[1:27:19] on that's just like your life Satan has
[1:27:22] wanted to say a lot of things about your
[1:27:24] life but when God comes and breaks the
[1:27:26] seal on your life it reveals you are
[1:27:29] always a son and daughter of
[1:27:32] God that's why Rahab could sat on the
[1:27:35] walls that were doomed for defeat but
[1:27:38] she had an expectation of Victory why
[1:27:42] she had been lifted her head had been
[1:27:45] lifted above her
[1:27:50] enemies I'd like to preach on that with
[1:27:52] Jeremiah but he had an
[1:27:56] expectation we're coming back cuz God
[1:27:58] said we're going to possess these lands
[1:28:00] [Applause]
[1:28:01] again Hallelujah let me tell you
[1:28:04] something this Earth is a redeemable
[1:28:06] attribute of God it's already it's
[1:28:09] already had its water
[1:28:12] baptism come on now the blood has been
[1:28:15] spilled upon it at Calvary and
[1:28:19] sanctification is going to work let me
[1:28:22] tell you it's going to move on out even
[1:28:24] right there in the Millennium to where
[1:28:26] the knowledge of the Lord shall fill the
[1:28:28] Earth land sea and sky and then it's
[1:28:31] going to receive its baptism by fire the
[1:28:34] baptism of the Holy Ghost and then that
[1:28:36] future home is going to set
[1:28:40] [Music]
[1:28:41] down you think she's beautiful now in
[1:28:44] some places you wait till she gets back
[1:28:46] under the control of Sons and Daughters
[1:28:49] of
[1:28:50] [Applause]
[1:28:51] God hey look look at your life
[1:28:54] look what your life is now look what it
[1:28:56] was look what it is now look what it is
[1:28:59] now under the control of the son of
[1:29:02] righteousness one time we were prickers
[1:29:04] and stickers and cactuses but now the
[1:29:07] desert is blossoming like a
[1:29:11] rose where they said there's no water
[1:29:14] God said I'll show you he that believeth
[1:29:16] on me as the scripture has said out of
[1:29:19] his belly shall flow rivers of riving
[1:29:22] water out of deserts the waters shall
[1:29:25] weep and
[1:29:27] flow brother this ain't just speaking of
[1:29:29] them it's speaking of your life right
[1:29:34] now hallu my wish I had time on
[1:29:40] that prise Lord Paul said it like this
[1:29:43] picked it up from Isaiah in Romans
[1:29:46] 9:29 except the Lord of Sabio had left
[1:29:49] us a seed we had been as Sodom and and
[1:29:54] gamorra right but God left us a
[1:29:57] promise let me tell you listen friends I
[1:30:00] hope you understand what I'm saying it's
[1:30:02] filled with promises yes it is there
[1:30:05] there every promise in the book let me
[1:30:06] tell you every promise in the book is on
[1:30:08] the line it's right here there's no
[1:30:10] promise there's no page no portion
[1:30:12] there's not even two or three words
[1:30:14] that's been ripped out the God who made
[1:30:16] the promise is a promise keeping
[1:30:20] God but all it takes is one promise you
[1:30:24] might just have it seem like one promise
[1:30:26] but God has given that promise and
[1:30:28] except God had left us a
[1:30:31] seed we had been like Sodom and
[1:30:34] gomorra but God left a
[1:30:37] promise I want you to look at this a
[1:30:39] moment some weeks ago when we started
[1:30:41] dealing with this on hope this is the
[1:30:43] scripture the lord gave
[1:30:46] me this portion of where remember Joseph
[1:30:50] is down there they've had meetings with
[1:30:52] Joseph already they've had where their
[1:30:55] money was returned they've now went and
[1:30:57] they've brought the little one Benjamin
[1:31:00] and as Benjamin has come back remember
[1:31:03] it was Judah that stepped forward and
[1:31:06] Judah told Daddy he said I will lay my
[1:31:10] life on the line that he will come back
[1:31:13] to you safely is that right you see
[1:31:16] Judah rising
[1:31:18] up I will lay my life on the line let's
[1:31:20] look at this now therefore when I come
[1:31:22] to thy servant my father father and the
[1:31:24] lad being all with us remember when they
[1:31:26] found they planted the cup in Benjamin
[1:31:28] sack and then they took the cup said
[1:31:30] whoever's cup my cup is in he's the one
[1:31:32] will will stay with
[1:31:34] me is that right amen Benjamin's going
[1:31:37] to take the cup of Salvation notice this
[1:31:39] and the lad be not with us seeing that
[1:31:42] his life is bound up in the lad's Life
[1:31:46] his life is bound up who's speaking here
[1:31:49] Judah it shall come to pass when he
[1:31:51] seeth that the lad is not with us he's
[1:31:54] talking about when he get home if
[1:31:55] Benjamin's not with him then he's going
[1:31:57] to die thy servant shall bring down the
[1:31:59] gray hairs of thy servant our father
[1:32:01] with sorrow to the Grave for thy servant
[1:32:04] became shity for the lad unto my father
[1:32:07] saying if I bring him not unto thee then
[1:32:11] I shall bear the blame to my father
[1:32:14] forever let me tell you this isn't just
[1:32:16] a word about Benjamin this is God
[1:32:19] committed to his word if God doesn't
[1:32:22] fulfill his word if God doesn't stand
[1:32:25] for his own word this is why in this
[1:32:27] hour a lamb has stood up this is why in
[1:32:31] this hour in Daniel 12 Michael stood
[1:32:36] up it's God standing up for his word
[1:32:40] amen God raising his hands in the heaven
[1:32:43] he swore by himself he is Charity listen
[1:32:48] the Holy Spirit coming to your life is
[1:32:51] the Assurance it's god making sure to
[1:32:54] bring you and I to the expected
[1:32:58] end the Holy Spirit dealing with your
[1:33:00] life is here to bring you to a fully
[1:33:03] manifested son and daughter of God it's

[1:33:13] sanctifies you and fills you with the
[1:33:16] Holy Ghost and matures you you are his
[1:33:20] workmanship
[1:33:22] Hallelujah is good that's why brother
[1:33:25] brand could say God's own life sixfold
[1:33:27] purpose of Daniel God's own life is
[1:33:29] bound with Israel he's married to her he
[1:33:31] says oh if the Lord willing will get
[1:33:33] into it he's married to Israel his life
[1:33:35] is bound to her just as I'm bound to Mrs
[1:33:38] brandham back there my wife you're bound
[1:33:40] to your wife your life is wrapped in it
[1:33:44] and God is married to
[1:33:48] Israel can I add just a little bit
[1:33:51] more let's take this promise

[1:34:18] sense or not it makes sense to you I'm
[1:34:20] not here to extract hope to where when
[1:34:22] you leave out of here oh I don't have no
[1:34:24] hope no I'm not here for that right I

[1:34:35] take what belongs to you it encourages
[1:34:37] you that you stand as a son and daughter
[1:34:39] of God in your own house in your own
[1:34:42] life and a
[1:34:43] Dominion this word comes to where it
[1:34:45] don't matter what shape the life is Hope

[1:34:48] know how bad this life is let me tell
[1:34:50] you something there ain't no hope out
[1:34:52] there but there is hope in the Lord if
[1:34:55] there's one place there's hope that's in
[1:34:57] the father's house if there's one place
[1:34:59] there's hope and that's in the word of
[1:35:00] God you might say my life might be
[1:35:03] twisted up it'd be easier to untangle a
[1:35:05] fishing line but I'm going to tell you
[1:35:07] it is nothing too hard for the Lord
[1:35:09] Jesus God knows how to get right down
[1:35:12] and move right down his grace is
[1:35:14] sufficient he'll take a life that maybe
[1:35:17] everybody else his railroad off and he
[1:35:19] will make a paradox out of that life by
[1:35:22] his Redeeming Grace you say how can you
[1:35:24] speak like that cuz my hope is in the
[1:35:26] Lord I know what he did for me and what
[1:35:30] he did for me he'll do it for someone
[1:35:32] else that'll believe him that'll trust
[1:35:37] him when I say believe him or trusting
[1:35:40] just accept the grace The Winds of the
[1:35:42] holy spirit that moves in cuz that's
[1:35:44] what it did on my
[1:35:47] life thank you Lord Brother BR said if
[1:35:49] I'm

[1:36:18] at brother Samuel all I can do right now
[1:36:21] is pray that's the greatest thing you
[1:36:23] can do oh because as you're praying it
[1:36:25] creates an
[1:36:28] expectation you start looking for it you
[1:36:31] start listening for change you start
[1:36:32] looking for text to come in different
[1:36:34] come on somebody prayer because you know
[1:36:37] what you're praying according to God's

[1:36:49] righteous man availeth much it's not
[1:36:52] your strength or power
[1:36:54] that turns them around it's the prayer
[1:36:56] of the Saints that's going out it's the
[1:36:58] Holy Spirit the token with that prayer
[1:37:01] that goes to deal with their life and
[1:37:03] turn their heart around I don't care

[1:37:49] another he'll make it so miserable for
[1:37:51] them till they have to do it

[1:37:55] believe it that's the way I believe
[1:37:58] itj that's the way you believe it I
[1:38:01] could go on and read it brother BR says
[1:38:03] I've seen many come to the altar he said
[1:38:05] and what it was their mother's already
[1:38:07] gone on their daddy already gone on he
[1:38:09] said but it was a prayer being answered

[1:38:21] vial yes Hallelujah come on they're not
[1:38:24] just wandering way out there they're in

[1:42:08] appointed to Salvation we are appointed
[1:42:11] to Deliverance are you with me this is
[1:42:14] what we so in other words this word this
[1:42:17] word to a real believer it's not a word
[1:42:19] of Doom and Gloom it's a word that lifts
[1:42:21] us it's a word that we can begin to see
[1:42:24] we begin to look at circumstances cuz I
[1:42:27] know everybody every one of us at times
[1:42:29] we've been in trials and felt like when
[1:42:31] is this trial ever going to end when is
[1:42:33] this test ever going to our flesh will
[1:42:35] say that come on now our flesh will say
[1:42:37] this but we recognize we've not this is
[1:42:40] not our destiny this test or this trial
[1:42:42] it's not our destiny it's just a point
[1:42:45] that I'm passing through and God has
[1:42:47] appointed me to
[1:42:49] Salvation I am an overcomer I am a
[1:42:53] Victorious One my hope is in the
[1:43:00] Lord think about how the Lord Jesus
[1:43:02] stood there and said
[1:43:05] destroy right this Temple and in three
[1:43:09] days I'll raise it up
[1:43:12] again they thought he was talking about
[1:43:14] that Temple he wasn't he had said before
[1:43:18] that I have power to lay my life down
[1:43:21] power to take it up again
[1:43:23] he said in his word in Psalms 16 where
[1:43:27] David come under the inspiration I have
[1:43:29] set the lord always before me therefore
[1:43:32] he is at my right hand I shall not be
[1:43:34] moved Hallelujah therefore my heart is
[1:43:37] glad you see when he becomes the
[1:43:38] strength of your life amen when he's at
[1:43:41] your right hand when he's the strength
[1:43:43] of your life when are you understanding
[1:43:45] me tonight when he's the one that's
[1:43:47] giving you courage to take a promise you
[1:43:49] might you might say brother Samuel I I'm
[1:43:51] one in the Holy Ghost he is now is being
[1:43:53] set before you he is the strength Giver
[1:43:56] of your life he's the one that's
[1:43:58] stimulating you he's the one that's
[1:44:00] encouraging you in the promise that
[1:44:03] belongs to you this is why you have set
[1:44:06] I have set the lord always before
[1:44:09] me my thought says that nope but God
[1:44:11] said this my feelings said nope God said
[1:44:16] this he is at my right hand he's the one
[1:44:19] I'm holding to his promise and I'm going
[1:44:21] to confess that promise might be here
[1:44:23] but I'm going to confess it till it
[1:44:25] drops from here down here I'm going to
[1:44:28] stand on that word because he made a
[1:44:30] promise and he cannot lie he made that
[1:44:33] promise before the foundation of the
[1:44:35] world and there's something that's
[1:44:37] energizing my soul say Amen to the word
[1:44:42] of
[1:44:43] God my hope is in the

[1:45:24] down we have received a victory a a a
[1:45:28] victory a Victorious word from a living
[1:45:35] God let me read this quote and I will
[1:45:41] close it's just so good it's good yes
[1:45:44] sir in the message thy
[1:45:46] house brother BR said he was behind
[1:45:48] talking about the Lord Jesus he was
[1:45:51] behind to barricade of scripture so if
[1:45:53] there's things that you're looking
[1:45:55] on expectations in your life this this
[1:45:58] puts it in
[1:45:59] perspective why couldn't he
[1:46:02] raise before the third day he was behind
[1:46:06] a barricade of
[1:46:09] scriptures remember my expectation is
[1:46:13] from him he reveals first to his
[1:46:17] servants the prophets what he's going to
[1:46:19] do and then he does it yes and you know
[1:46:23] how he does it in you in me how did God
[1:46:29] cross over into the promised land the
[1:46:31] prophet said he crossed over into the
[1:46:34] promised land in
[1:46:41] them he couldn't rise for three days and
[1:46:43] his Spirit was back up here in the
[1:46:45] presence of God after three days that
[1:46:47] barricade was taken down because the
[1:46:49] scripture was fulfilled and his Spirit
[1:46:51] Went to went to the and the soul went to
[1:46:53] the body and he rose up he said before
[1:46:55] he died I have power to lay my life down
[1:46:57] I have power to take it up again now
[1:46:59] think of it every one of look at this so
[1:47:01] powerful every one of you in here as far
[1:47:02] as I know tonight as Christians look the
[1:47:04] thing that is in you now the spirit that
[1:47:07] is in you now is the same spirit that
[1:47:09] will raise you up you have power to lay
[1:47:13] your life down and you're doing it right
[1:47:16] now for Christ and then you'll have
[1:47:19] power to take it up again
[1:47:22] you think it ain't powerful to be able
[1:47:24] to lay down a grudge be able to lay down
[1:47:27] bitterness I'm telling you that ain't
[1:47:28] your human strength it ain't my human
[1:47:31] strength that's a power that lays within
[1:47:33] you that's right and because of that
[1:47:36] what are you you have that hope in you
[1:47:39] purify himself even as he is pure he
[1:47:43] reveals himself to you and I and there's
[1:47:46] an amen from
[1:47:47] within so be it Lord and what is it it's
[1:47:50] power to lay my life down what is it he
[1:47:53] makes real there's no value to this this
[1:47:56] is hindering me from working it's
[1:47:58] hindering from me and working your life
[1:47:59] and our whole objective and motive is
[1:48:02] wrapped in him you love
[1:48:05] him oh my we have power to lay it down
[1:48:09] power to pick it up again oh my
[1:48:12] Hallelujah I wish I could read the rest
[1:48:14] of the quote but I'm not I'm not going
[1:48:18] to well maybe live for a portion of it

[1:48:26] last week I was really I was so inspired
[1:48:28] I couldn't get to this brother BR said
[1:48:29] you see when that scripture is fulfilled
[1:48:31] talking about those that's went on
[1:48:32] beyond the curtain of time and then the
[1:48:34] Rapture coming on he said then in
[1:48:36] paragraph 137 that Spirit descends right
[1:48:38] down straight under the altar there and
[1:48:39] takes up that soul that Soul goes right
[1:48:41] down and picks up the body and there you
[1:48:43] are raised up again think of it the holy
