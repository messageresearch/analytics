[1:26] [Music]
[1:33] again. So many times I've
[1:38] questioned certain
[1:41] circumstances and
[1:43] things I could not understand.
[1:47] [Music]
[1:49] Lord of many times in
[1:53] trials, weakness blurs my vision. And
[1:57] it's then my frustrations get so out of
[2:04] hand. Oh, it's then I am
[2:09] reminded. I've never been
[2:11] forsen. And Lord, I've never had to
[2:15] stand one test alone.
[2:20] And as I look out on the
[2:23] victories, his spirit rises up in me and
[2:29] it's through the fire. My weakness is
[2:32] made
[2:33] [Applause]
[2:35] strong.
[2:36] Lord, he never
[2:39] promised that the cross would not get
[2:43] heavy and the hill would not be hard to
[2:52] pass. He never
[2:55] offered victory without fighting. But he
[3:00] said hell would always come on time.
[3:05] [Music]
[3:08] Just remember
[3:11] when in the valley of
[3:15] decision and your adversary
[3:18] says give
[3:21] in. Just hold
[3:25] on. Our Lord will show
[3:29] up and he will take you
[3:34] through
[3:38] again. Oh, I know within
[3:42] myself that I would surely perish. Oh,
[3:47] but if I trust the hand of God, he'll
[3:51] shield the flame.
[3:57] For he never
[3:59] promised that the cross would not get
[4:03] heavy and the hill would not be
[4:07] hard to
[4:09] climb. Oh, praise the Lord today,
[4:12] saints. He never
[4:16] offered victory without fighting. He
[4:20] said, "Help would
[4:22] always come on
[4:25] [Music]
[4:27] time." Well, just remember when you're
[4:31] standing in the valley of
[4:35] decision. Hallelujah.
[4:39] He says, "Give
[4:42] in
[4:46] just cuz our Lord will show
[4:50] up and he will take you through the
[4:59] Just hold
[5:01] on. Our Lord will show
[5:05] up and he will take you through fire
[5:12] [Music]
[5:13] again. Hallelujah. Let's sing this.
[5:16] Something keeps holding. Something keeps
[5:18] holding me. Something keeps holding me.
[5:21] Let's just sing this before we usually
[5:22] don't do two songs, but this one just
[5:24] came on my heart. Let's sing this one
[5:26] before we go. The trials of this
[5:32] world were getting
[5:35] [Music]
[5:39] stronger. Oh, the pull I
[5:42] felt was more than
[5:46] I could bear.
[5:53] And I was on the
[5:57] verge of giving
[6:02] over. Oh yes, Lord. Oh, the strength
[6:07] within
[6:09] myself just wasn't
[6:12] [Applause]

[6:55] reality and something keeps
[6:59] holding. Oh, hallelujah. Oh, praise your
[7:02] name, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord.
[7:04] Hallelujah. Oh, Satan laid before
[7:10] me his
[7:12] [Music]
[7:16] temptation. For it was his
[7:19] desire to steal
[7:23] away my faith.
[7:27] Oh, I got joy this morning, church. But
[7:30] I have found
[7:33] inside. Oh,

[8:33] holding. Let's all stand together this
[8:35] morning. Let's sing. We know who's

[30:55] mystery I have heard, but now I

[32:31] see
[32:31] [Applause]
[32:34] why? Well, you know what you got to sing
[32:37] after that song. Can't you
[32:41] see why this
[32:44] morning? As brother Samuel guess comes
[32:46] this morning looking forward to the
[32:47] word. Oh, I've

[32:57] comes from. Hallelujah. Well, the
[33:03] reveal

[34:04] prophet of Malach.

[34:42] soul rejoice.
[34:47] Take

[34:52] Hallelujah.
[34:54] In
[34:56] what you let my life Lord every day may
[35:01] it be a
[35:03] sweet
[35:05] sweet
[35:07] sound in your ear.
[35:12] Oh, we love you,
[35:14] [Music]
[35:15] Lord. Oh, I love you,
[35:22] Lord. And I
[35:26] lift
[35:27] my
[35:30] voice to
[35:33] [Music]

[35:37] you, oh my soul.
[35:42] Yes, rejoice. Let's all stand together
[35:44] as our pastor comes. Take joy, my
[35:51] king.
[35:53] It
[35:55] was
[35:56] you
[35:58] here. It be a
[36:02] sweet,
[36:06] sweet in
[36:08] your ear. Sing it one more time as our
[36:10] pastor come. Let's just all raise our
[36:12] hands together. Sing it. Oh Lord, let
[36:13] him know you love him this morning. Oh,
[36:15] I love you,
[36:20] Lord. And I
[36:24] live. I will lift my
[36:28] voice to
[36:33] worship you.
[36:35] But oh my
[36:38] soul I
[36:41] [Music]
[36:43] rejoice take
[36:45] [Music]
[36:50] in
[36:52] what you hear. Oh, and may it be a
[36:59] sweet,
[37:01] sweet
[37:03] sound in your ears. May it be a
[37:10] sweet,
[37:12] sweet
[37:14] sound in your ears.
[37:21] Praise the Lord Jesus. Amen. You love
[37:24] him this morning.
[37:26] Amen. It's so good to be together. So
[37:28] thankful for God's mercy. Amen. Upon us
[37:31] and um
[37:33] we just um looking to the Lord for what
[37:36] he would have in store for us. And Amen.
[37:39] Good to see some different some faces
[37:41] back that uh were out and sick and we're
[37:45] so thankful for God's healing touch,
[37:46] aren't we? Amen. I tell you. And just as
[37:49] I just really feel pressed on my heart
[37:52] and I think we could all join together
[37:54] even once again here as we prepare to
[37:57] approach the word that may God bring a
[37:59] real strength even to our immune
[38:01] systems. Right. Amen. Because you say,
[38:04] "Oh, brother Samuel, we have scripture
[38:06] that says that wherein that you know uh
[38:10] he by his stripes we were healed."
[38:12] That's true. But there's also a
[38:15] scripture where John
[38:17] said,
[38:18] "Beloved, I would thou work in health."
[38:22] Right?
[38:24] Is that right? Even as thy soul
[38:27] prospers.
[38:29] So God's not only interested in divine
[38:31] healing, he's interested in divine
[38:33] health.
[38:35] Amen. So we we have an approach to pray
[38:38] and and ask for the Lord that God would
[38:40] just would just come among us and and
[38:43] just really give us strength and touch
[38:45] us. Amen. It's we we certainly need a
[38:48] touch from the Lord. And we God knew we
[38:51] would be living living here in this time
[38:53] in this age. It's true. There's a lot of
[38:55] factors, a lot of things that if we look
[38:57] at it that it can be it can be very
[39:00] discouraging. But you know what? We can
[39:03] always go to God in prayer. God is
[39:06] faithful. God has given us his word and
[39:08] God will guide and direct us and see us
[39:11] through just exactly what we have need
[39:13] of. Amen. You believe that? He's
[39:16] faithful. He's faithful. Amen. Let's
[39:19] just approach him in a word of prayer as
[39:21] we prepare for this part of the
[39:23] service. Heavenly
[39:26] Father, Lord, how thankful we are for
[39:29] your mercies once again.
[39:32] Thank you Lord for allowing us to be
[39:35] able to gather Lord here. These are
[39:39] moments Lord that we certainly don't
[39:41] take for
[39:42] granted. And I pray that Lord if we have
[39:45] in any way that you would forgive us for
[39:48] Lord
[39:49] we when we're not able to be here it's
[39:52] something Lord we look back and say oh
[39:54] God I I want to be there. We know that,
[39:57] Lord, that we're thankful for all of the
[40:00] ways that you provided for us, Lord. I
[40:02] I'm so thankful, God, for the assembly
[40:04] that you provided streaming for us,
[40:07] Lord, when different ones are sick and
[40:09] they're shut in, Lord. I thank you for
[40:11] that, Lord. And Lord, I'm thankful God
[40:14] that you provided, Lord, that where we
[40:16] could come and gather, Lord, together,
[40:20] Father, putting our licks of fire
[40:22] together, Lord, just knowing that when
[40:25] your children come together, as the
[40:27] prophet said, it's more of the Godhead
[40:29] bodily among us. Now, Lord, you see the
[40:33] needs. How wonderful it is, Lord, to see
[40:37] different ones, Lord. Just, Lord, being
[40:39] able to be back, Lord. Father, just
[40:42] strengthening them in their body. And
[40:44] Lord, I pray God as we Lord would unite
[40:47] our hearts and our faith together as an
[40:50] assembly right now. You know the needs
[40:53] Lord that are among us. And we're asking
[40:55] God not only Lord for divine healing in
[40:58] our body, Lord, for every sickness, for
[41:01] every condition, Lord, that is present,
[41:04] but we're asking God for divine health
[41:07] as well, Lord. Father, may you just
[41:10] minister to our bodies, Lord. I pray
[41:13] that God just bring a a real strength,
[41:16] Lord, that to the immune systems, Lord.
[41:19] Oh, God. May your presence, you're still
[41:21] the same God that Lord restores, Lord,
[41:24] heart, Lord, from heart conditions and
[41:27] delivers from diabetes, Lord, and breaks
[41:30] the yoke of high blood pressure, God,
[41:32] and heals the oppressed, Lord. You're
[41:34] still the same God that Lord to move
[41:36] upon the immune system Lord you're the
[41:39] almighty God. And so Lord you said ask
[41:43] the father anything in my name and I'll
[41:44] do it. Lord as your prophet taught us
[41:47] Lord that we have the right motive and
[41:50] objective within it that Lord we want to
[41:52] serve you Lord and serve you better
[41:54] Lord. So I pray that God that you'll
[41:56] just move Lord. I pray father uh through
[41:59] our lives upon our bodies Lord in every
[42:02] system oh God may it be brought Lord in
[42:05] complete subjection to the word of God
[42:08] and the confession Lord from our heart
[42:10] we pray
[42:12] grant it Lord may you strengthen your
[42:14] children Lord I pray be with each and
[42:17] everyone Lord may you just guide us this
[42:20] morning Lord we reserve Lord ourself
[42:23] completely to you Lord that you might
[42:25] have complete preeminence in this
[42:27] service Lord Lord, and guide and direct
[42:29] the thoughts, Lord, of our hearts, Lord,
[42:31] that Father, that what you've
[42:33] determined, Lord, may we be in that
[42:35] channel, oh God, of one mind, Lord, of
[42:38] one heart, one accord. And may you just,
[42:41] Lord, come and perform your word right
[42:44] among us, in us, Lord, and through us.
[42:46] We pray. We ask it in the name of Jesus
[42:49] Christ. Amen and
[42:51] amen. Amen. God bless
[42:54] you. Amen.
[42:59] Amen. I'd like to go to back to Psalms
[43:04] 103 here this morning. And
[43:15] uh I just want to kind of take just
[43:20] a just a little bit of an approach and
[43:24] upon this and um may God help us just to
[43:28] build it to the place that where we can
[43:31] be able to receive from the Lord what he
[43:34] would desire to minister to us. You
[43:37] know, there's no ending place to the
[43:38] word of God. And uh the word of God is
[43:42] so beautiful, so wonderful, so
[43:44] encouraging. Amen. And so Psalms 103, a
[43:48] very familiar passage. We read from this
[43:50] last week. David said, "Bless the Lord,
[43:53] oh my soul, and all that is within me,
[43:56] bless his holy name. Bless the Lord, oh
[43:59] my soul, and forget not all his
[44:03] benefits. Who forgiveth all thine
[44:07] iniquities, who health all thy diseases,
[44:12] and who redeemth thy life from
[44:15] destruction, who crowneth thee with
[44:17] loving kindness and tender mercies, who
[44:20] satisfithth thy mouth with good things,
[44:24] so that thy youth is renewed like the
[44:28] eagles. Amen. May God bless you and
[44:31] bless the reading of the word. As you're
[44:32] being seated, I'd like to continue that
[44:37] thought on
[44:39] God's provided place of healing. And I
[44:42] want to I'm going to move into another a
[44:46] little portion of this, a little channel
[44:48] within in healing. And I wanted just
[44:51] maybe to build a little bit of a
[44:53] background here and to know that, you
[44:56] know, brother Ram would say at many
[44:58] different places, three places at least
[45:02] that I I know of where he would speak
[45:05] regarding that of of healing that it is
[45:08] all healing. It does come from the Lord
[45:12] and God will heal through medicine. God
[45:17] will heal through music. God will heal
[45:20] through love. God will heal through
[45:22] care. And brother Brandon makes this
[45:25] statement. He says, "It just depends on
[45:28] what what type of healing that you
[45:32] need." So God God knows and he is
[45:37] mindful to minister to all the healing
[45:41] that we would have need of. And as we
[45:43] would say through this journey that we
[45:46] we are on that the ultimate healing and
[45:49] what is the absolute necessary healing
[45:53] is the healing of our soul
[45:57] because when our body has been um and
[46:00] been made well and and and I tell you
[46:03] that it feels good to feel good
[46:06] but that body we understand we've
[46:09] experienced it and sometimes more
[46:11] frequency and so forth. forth. We we
[46:14] sickness can come again or some other
[46:16] type of affliction can come. But once
[46:19] the soul has ever been healed, it can
[46:23] never be touched again.
[46:26] The scripture said we are sealed until
[46:30] the day of redemption. And so that's the
[46:33] healing that we are to be in pursuit of
[46:37] or if I can say in pursuit of is rather
[46:40] to be yielded to is that that God would
[46:43] take us to a complete and full healing
[46:47] in our soul. And so within that, we were
[46:51] looking at that last week that healing
[46:54] itself, it comes from the inside out
[46:57] because even when we think of
[46:59] medicine, you can place medicine, let's
[47:02] say, you know, I I had at one point in
[47:05] time I had when when I'd cut this part
[47:07] with a knife when I was back in college
[47:09] by accident and that tendon was popping
[47:12] out of there and you know, they stitched
[47:15] it up and then there was ointment that
[47:18] they put on it and you know back then I
[47:20] didn't have access to vitamin E ointment
[47:23] you know now you just put that vitamin E
[47:25] ointment on certain things and it really
[47:27] helps you know within it it's things
[47:29] that's just it's from from nature that
[47:31] that helps but to understand that you
[47:34] know to see how that within that light
[47:36] that healing comes from the inside is
[47:39] that brother Brandon makes it so so
[47:41] simple he says if let's say for example
[47:44] that this body I would have that wound
[47:46] or that cut if life goes out of my body
[47:49] and I'm here I am laying in the morg.
[47:51] They could put all of the ointment they
[47:53] want on this wound and it would never
[47:57] heal because life is the healer. True.
[48:02] And so this is why that within our lives
[48:06] that you know it's always in that place
[48:09] I think God in his mercy of how that God
[48:12] would know that there would be lives and
[48:15] hearts that would never be surrendered
[48:18] uh to believe the Lord for healing and
[48:20] they they would just look at and say oh
[48:22] that's that's foolishness and oh it's
[48:25] just you know our our great
[48:27] understanding and we we we know that
[48:29] it's God that gives them an access to
[48:32] understand certain things and we see
[48:34] that certain surgeries are certainly um
[48:37] are certainly uh much better than it was
[48:39] even some years ago. I think even with
[48:41] open heart surgery from when my dad went
[48:43] through it 99 to others that's went
[48:45] through it here not too long ago. It's
[48:47] much different than what it was then
[48:49] even the recovery times and how they'll
[48:51] do different things. But you see it's
[48:53] it's all by medicine and medicine what
[48:56] medicine does is medicine it allows it
[49:00] ministers there to the body and allows
[49:02] the body to heal itself because it's
[49:05] just like anybody in here ever had a
[49:07] broken
[49:08] bone. Okay, Sister Wilma, I know Sister
[49:10] Wilma has. Okay, brother Brian, you
[49:13] probably had a few, huh? No, I just
[49:14] teased him, Brother
[49:16] Brian. Just teas him. But you know,
[49:19] we've heard we've all heard brother
[49:20] Brandham say this. You know, you can go
[49:23] to the doctor, they set the bone, but
[49:26] they don't heal it.
[49:28] Is that right? They they only try to set
[49:31] it. And then you have things like Sister
[49:32] Wilma, what you had come through here
[49:34] some years ago where they they did a
[49:36] surgery there on her ankle and actually
[49:38] the doctor that wasn't done correctly
[49:40] and that's why they had to redo it. and
[49:42] and boy, how we're thankful for God's
[49:44] touch on Sister Wilma's life cuz she's
[49:46] really went through a battle after that
[49:48] last surgery to correct that. So, first
[49:50] of all, it's got to be set correctly. We
[49:52] see that like Sister Wilma, what an
[49:53] example here today. It's got to be set
[49:55] correctly to to grow back correctly or
[49:57] else it's going to give some real pain
[49:59] and discomfort and things like that. And
[50:01] I always think my dad when they when
[50:04] they opened him up for the open heart,
[50:06] dad would, you know, he would he would
[50:07] always a lot of times he would rub that.
[50:09] He would kind of complain. He said, "I
[50:10] just get so tired. I get so weary and he
[50:12] said he said sometimes I wonder you know
[50:15] dad would make comments he said you know
[50:17] I wonder if they got the right person or
[50:19] wonder you know if I wonder if they did
[50:20] it correctly you know because it would
[50:22] there were different times he would just
[50:24] do this I remember my dad just doing
[50:25] that you know and he would talk about
[50:27] just getting so tired and things but my
[50:29] point within it is is that it's when
[50:32] things have to be set correctly and then
[50:34] it will heal and this is why when God
[50:37] the Bible says in the book of Psalms 105
[50:40] Five, he hath sent his
[50:43] word and he healed them.
[50:47] You see, God's word, it comes into our
[50:50] life to set things in the right
[50:53] direction. It it comes to bring us back,
[50:56] if I can use the scriptural term, back
[50:59] into harmony with God. This is why the
[51:03] Holy Spirit deals with the heart to
[51:05] bring us first of all to recognize we're
[51:08] a sinner to recognize the path we're on.
[51:12] Lead us. The Bible says the goodness of
[51:14] God leads us to repentance. It's like
[51:18] it's like the doctor taking a hold of a
[51:20] bone or something and saying this is
[51:22] going to hurt, but we got to put this
[51:24] back in line. See, repentance, it's the
[51:27] goodness of God. It brings us to that
[51:29] place of the realization. It's not just
[51:32] a a sorrowfulness for, oh, what a
[51:34] condition I'm in. Oh, what a shape I'm
[51:36] in. No, that's worldly sorrow. But godly
[51:39] sorrow is where we can we see the effect
[51:42] and we and we see our need for for one
[51:47] who who who is greater than us, one who
[51:50] has already paved the way for you and I.
[51:53] And it's the spirit of God working upon
[51:56] our hearts. It's the revelation of Jesus
[51:59] Christ moving and dealing with our life
[52:01] to do what? Get us in line for healing.
[52:06] Amen. And then comes, you know, the God
[52:09] gives us, as the Bible said, a new heart
[52:11] and new spirit. It's a new way of
[52:13] thinking about the word of God and
[52:15] things that we never, you know, even our
[52:18] our thoughts, you know, and
[52:19] sanctification and how we think about
[52:22] things and, oh, I I don't want to do
[52:23] this and I don't want to do that and and
[52:25] we're, you know, you're we're kind of,
[52:27] you know, just looking in a place to
[52:29] where that now God can even deal with us
[52:31] because, you know, as brother Brandham
[52:33] said, when that new heart and that new
[52:34] spirit has come, he said many times, he
[52:37] said, people mistake that for the Holy
[52:39] Ghost. He said, "But really, God has to
[52:41] give you a new heart and new spirit for
[52:44] for you to even get along with yourself,
[52:47] much less with God." So, you see what
[52:50] God's doing? He's taking like the bones
[52:52] and what's out of place in our life, and
[52:54] he's working to bring it in harmony with
[52:57] his word. It's God who gives the new
[53:00] spirit. It's God who gives the new
[53:02] heart. And then he said, "I will cause
[53:05] my spirit
[53:08] to dwell in you." and cause you to keep
[53:12] my statutes. I'll cause you to walk in
[53:15] my way. So, so it it will not be uh
[53:18] something that you know where uh I I
[53:20] don't want to say it's not a struggle
[53:21] because you always you always struggle
[53:23] with the flesh but to understand the
[53:25] reality of that life on the inside when
[53:27] the desires have been changed to where
[53:30] that even when something has gone wrong
[53:32] or the slightest wrong there is a a
[53:36] reality that rises within us to say
[53:38] forgive me Lord because there why it's a
[53:42] desire to remain in harmony with the
[53:46] harmony we've been brought back into.
[53:49] You see, this is it's all God and now
[53:53] it's God from the inside working to the
[53:55] outside. So, this is where that brother
[53:58] Ram said, you know, a conversion is not
[54:01] something from the outside in, but we
[54:04] want to come from the inside out. Right.
[54:06] Amen. And so, you know, uh they can
[54:09] close up a wound, but if they don't get
[54:11] everything out of that wound,
[54:14] it can.
[54:16] So, you got to get that we got to get
[54:18] the wound cleared out, then we can
[54:20] stitch it up. And then you can continue
[54:23] to minister to it. So, it's getting
[54:24] things set and in line in order. And I
[54:27] want to say it in this way that God
[54:30] himself is indeed our provider and he
[54:34] provides just what we have need of in
[54:37] every crucial moment.
[54:40] Let me just give you just a few just a
[54:42] few little quotations here. Brother Ram
[54:44] said God had sent Abraham to this
[54:46] destination. He's talking about Genesis
[54:48] 22 to this place. And when Abraham got
[54:51] there, God was under
[54:54] obligation to keep his word to Abraham.
[54:57] And he provided a sacrifice in the
[55:01] crucial moment when it was needed. Now,
[55:04] I love that when it was needed. You see,
[55:07] the greatest thing that you and I, the
[55:09] greatest I think every one of us could
[55:11] say, I want to give God the greatest
[55:13] compliment.
[55:15] And you know, the greatest compliment
[55:16] that we can give to God is to believe
[55:19] him. Amen.
[55:21] And to obey him. That's the greatest
[55:22] compliment you can you can give God no
[55:24] higher compliment to than to believing.
[55:27] Amen. And to trust him and to and elites
[55:30] to obedience. All of that works
[55:32] together. And notice Abraham didn't try
[55:35] to figure out how is this going to
[55:37] happen. But God had worked upon his
[55:40] heart and his life to where now he comes
[55:42] to this place in Mount Mariah. And God
[55:46] at the very moment when the knife is in
[55:48] the air to take his son's life, we
[55:51] recognize this was all a type of
[55:53] Calvary. And it was also a type just as
[55:57] the lamb of God laid down his life so
[56:02] that the life in that blood cell could
[56:05] come back and deal with the lambs of God
[56:10] and lead the lambs of God to their own
[56:14] sacrificial surrender of their own lives
[56:18] to the will of God.
[56:19] So Mount Mariah was a complete display
[56:22] of Calvary and then through Calvary how
[56:26] the spirit of God would lead the
[56:28] children of God in a life of full
[56:30] surrender.
[56:32] So when you when we look at this,
[56:34] brother Ram says he comes in this he
[56:36] says of how you know the vision itself
[56:39] let me back up. He says it it wasn't a
[56:41] vision it was really a ram. Abraham
[56:44] picked it up, tied it, laid it on the
[56:46] altar, and stabbed it with his knife,
[56:48] and blood run out of it, and it died. A
[56:52] ram that had been flashed into existence
[56:54] in one minute. And the next minute went
[56:57] out of existence as a sacrifice. God can
[57:00] do all things. He's Jehovah Gyra.
[57:04] Let me tell you who this ram was. This
[57:06] ram was the same one who was slain in
[57:09] Genesis
[57:10] 15. Amen. Genesis 22 said, "I looked
[57:16] to see I'm talking about Revelations 5
[57:19] with Genesis 22. I looked to see the
[57:22] lion that had prevailed. And what did he
[57:24] see? He saw a lamb that had been bloody,
[57:28] one that had overcome."
[57:31] Is that right? So now God's provided
[57:35] way. This is what this is what the
[57:38] message of the hour has brought to you
[57:40] and I. It brings the reality that all
[57:44] that you have need of, he has already
[57:50] provided.
[57:52] It takes away the veils of thinking. It
[57:56] does away with all of the uh anything to
[58:00] where it becomes as though it's my
[58:02] efforts, it's my abilities, it's my
[58:05] love. No, it does away with it all. And
[58:07] it shows just trusting our faith in God
[58:11] and God provides what's needed at the
[58:14] crucial moment. That's what this message
[58:17] did. Let me just tell you something. I
[58:19] can tell you right here this morning. If
[58:20] you'll just let your faith loose, it
[58:23] doesn't matter what might be troubling
[58:24] you. Amen. It it doesn't matter even
[58:27] what habits might be in your life. It
[58:30] doesn't even matter the sin condition.
[58:32] Let me just say it to you. You don't
[58:33] even have to wait till the end of the
[58:35] service to receive deliverance. He is
[58:39] almighty God and your faith being
[58:43] released. He can move right there and
[58:46] circumcise your heart and take out the
[58:48] desires, things that you've tried to lay
[58:51] down. He can move right forth this
[58:53] morning and take it right out of your
[58:55] life and raise your faith up to where
[58:58] it's intended to be.
[59:00] Hallelujah. Why? It's a work between God
[59:02] and man.
[59:05] Oh, hallelujah. Brother Ram said, when
[59:07] that crucial moment has been come, God
[59:09] is able to step right there and provide
[59:12] the sacrifice or provide the way. When
[59:16] God has made a promise, God's under
[59:18] obligation to his word to keep it. God's
[59:22] always God's always had a had a had a
[59:25] provided way. this message. If you
[59:27] haven't listened to this message in a
[59:28] while, my lord, I I just been just
[59:31] really really joy enjoying this message.
[59:32] God's provided healing for this
[59:34] generation in
[59:35] 1954 because just to put it in
[59:39] perspective, God has always had what was
[59:42] needed for his people at that time. He
[59:45] had what was needed with the ram. He had
[59:48] what was needed when Israel got into the
[59:51] wilderness. They were backed up against
[59:53] the Red Sea. He made a way. Amen. When
[59:56] they were in need of water, he made a
[59:59] way. The rock, God, God, the rock that
[1:00:01] followed them, there was rock. There was
[1:00:03] water that came out of that rock. Right.
[1:00:06] When they had need of food, God supplied
[1:00:08] the mana. And even when they themselves
[1:00:11] wanted meat, God sent a wind and blew
[1:00:13] the kale in or the Yeah. the quail. He
[1:00:16] blew it into the camp.
[1:00:18] God has always He's always when they
[1:00:21] came upon bitter waters here, he
[1:00:23] directed Moses to see that that that
[1:00:26] bush that was growing there and he took
[1:00:28] that bush down and put it there in those
[1:00:30] waters and the waters that were bitter
[1:00:32] became sweet. There's there's nothing
[1:00:34] that can sweeten our lives. There's
[1:00:37] nothing that can sweeten our experience.
[1:00:40] Nothing can do that outside of the Lord
[1:00:43] Jesus Christ. Yeah, he was wounded for
[1:00:46] my transgressions.
[1:00:48] Amen. That he was placed upon a tree. He
[1:00:52] also was that tree representing that was
[1:00:55] shown to Moses that when it was cut down
[1:00:58] and placed into the waters of humanity,
[1:01:01] it can sweeten bitter waters.
[1:01:04] Hallelujah. It can take away the
[1:01:06] bitterness from your life, our lives,
[1:01:08] and sweeten it. It can sweeten every
[1:01:11] experience. Who can do that? He can do
[1:01:13] that.
[1:01:14] Amen. So he's always provided. God even
[1:01:17] when one brother I love how he says it
[1:01:20] in this message. He says even when there
[1:01:22] was one God was bringing one type to an
[1:01:25] end. God always made sure there was that
[1:01:28] next part that was ready to move right
[1:01:31] into action. When the pool of Bethesda
[1:01:33] of how that they would angel would come
[1:01:35] down at a certain season and trouble the
[1:01:38] water and remember the man who was not
[1:01:40] able to get there. He said I'm not able
[1:01:42] to get there. And when that in itself
[1:01:44] was getting ready to be removed a as a
[1:01:48] source or as a place here here we find
[1:01:51] God himself had come down and
[1:01:53] tabernacled in flesh what as the
[1:01:56] provided way of healing.
[1:01:59] So there's always been a provided way of
[1:02:02] healing. Let me tell you this isn't
[1:02:04] something Let me just say it like this.
[1:02:06] There's things right now they talk about
[1:02:08] antibiotic resistance and all these
[1:02:10] other things and so forth. And you know
[1:02:12] what? I'm I'm not g I'm not here to to
[1:02:15] talk about it, debate about it. I'm not
[1:02:17] here to look at it. We understand
[1:02:18] there's certain things that won't work.
[1:02:20] But let me just tell you something.
[1:02:21] There has never I don't care. There's
[1:02:23] never been sin or sickness or anything
[1:02:27] that's able to withstand the blood of
[1:02:29] Jesus Christ. The blood is all
[1:02:32] sufficient.
[1:02:34] Amen. Just like we read for our text, it
[1:02:37] don't matter. The blood, it is more than
[1:02:39] enough.
[1:02:41] And you know what brings that blood to
[1:02:42] your life? Because the blood was shed
[1:02:44] back there. But it was the life that was
[1:02:47] within that blood. And what brings that
[1:02:49] to your life? What brings it to your
[1:02:51] heart? What brings it to your body? What
[1:02:53] applies it is faith applies the blood
[1:02:57] that was shed. Amen.
[1:03:00] That's so good. Yes. Amen. And you know,
[1:03:02] God, think about it. Brother Ram says it
[1:03:05] like this of how they were going in the
[1:03:07] wilderness and you know you know I love
[1:03:09] how brother Ram would would dramatize it
[1:03:11] there and he said if we could just think
[1:03:12] of Moses because the Bible said there
[1:03:14] weren't any of them stricken or
[1:03:16] afflicted. Right? Now it didn't mean
[1:03:18] that they didn't come down with
[1:03:20] sicknesses. It didn't mean that things
[1:03:22] didn't come about them. You see how
[1:03:24] brother Ram would tie that in? He would
[1:03:26] look at that in the scriptures and how
[1:03:27] God would show him. Sure, there were
[1:03:29] things that came up in the camp, but God
[1:03:32] himself had already provided. Amen. You
[1:03:36] see, God's not in the business of trying
[1:03:38] to figure things out right now and oh
[1:03:40] my, what do I do? This is a crisis
[1:03:42] situation. He's already provided.
[1:03:47] What we read here in Psalms 103, that
[1:03:50] was clear back there in the mind of God.
[1:03:54] That's right. Isaiah saw it. Isaiah was
[1:03:57] picked up and saw it as a past event in
[1:04:00] the mind of God. It hadn't even happened
[1:04:02] yet.
[1:04:04] Is that right? Yes. And to see how that
[1:04:07] God would take that and and Brother Ram
[1:04:09] said, "Would you like to look in that
[1:04:11] doctor's bag a little bit?" I love that.
[1:04:14] He said, "Let's let's look in here." He
[1:04:16] said, "And let's see what it was." Maybe
[1:04:17] there was one getting ready to have a
[1:04:18] baby. Maybe there was one where glaccom
[1:04:20] came up in their eye. Maybe there was
[1:04:22] one that came with a broken broken arm.
[1:04:24] man. And he went through a whole list of
[1:04:26] different things. He said, "Let's see
[1:04:28] what prescription Dr. Moses had in the
[1:04:30] bag." Oh, I find it. I'm the Lord that
[1:04:33] health all thy diseases.
[1:04:36] [Applause]
[1:04:37] It didn't matter what the circumstance
[1:04:40] was, the answer was always the same.
[1:04:44] That's right. Hallelujah. The answers
[1:04:47] never changed. I'm the Lord that health
[1:04:49] all thine diseases. Amen. Oh my. And God
[1:04:53] allowed them even when remember when
[1:04:55] they were bitten with the snakes.
[1:04:57] Remember they had complained and notice
[1:04:59] God's mercy how that they raised up on a
[1:05:02] on a pole and rep you know that pole
[1:05:05] representing the cross and and how they
[1:05:08] rep represented they put on there a
[1:05:10] serpent and on that serpent it was
[1:05:12] brass. Brass means judgment. Look on the
[1:05:14] side or when you go in a hospital, when
[1:05:17] you go in a doctor's office, on the side
[1:05:20] of an ambulance, you'll see it. It's a
[1:05:23] brazen serpent. It won't be the color of
[1:05:26] brass. But let me ask you something.
[1:05:27] Even that with the medical science and
[1:05:29] all of that up on there. You know what
[1:05:31] it testifies of? Healing. Amen. And you
[1:05:34] know what? It represented sin already
[1:05:36] judged. Because as soon as you deal with
[1:05:39] sin, you're also going to deal with
[1:05:41] healing. Amen. or sickness in order to
[1:05:44] bring healing. Hallelujah. And all they
[1:05:47] had to do was look and live.
[1:05:53] Amen. And brother Rabbit said God
[1:05:54] allowed them to draw dividends on the
[1:05:58] promise that hadn't even fully come to
[1:06:01] pass yet.
[1:06:03] They were drawing dividends from the
[1:06:05] mind of God of Isaiah 53. They were
[1:06:09] already drawing dividends. Let me tell
[1:06:10] you something. You're already drawing
[1:06:12] dividends while you and I are here in
[1:06:15] this pest house of a body. We've
[1:06:17] received the earnest or the down payment
[1:06:22] when we receive the Holy Ghost.
[1:06:25] And it is a down payment and earnest
[1:06:28] that the rest is coming. I've got a body
[1:06:31] over yonder.
[1:06:33] And I tell you, we're groaning for a
[1:06:35] rightful condition. Right. Let me just
[1:06:38] read a few scriptures here out of Romans
[1:06:40] chapter 8 and verse 20. For the creature
[1:06:43] was made subject to vanity, not
[1:06:45] willingly, but by reason of him who hath
[1:06:48] subjected the same in hope, because the
[1:06:50] creature itself also shall be delivered
[1:06:53] from the bondage of corruption into the
[1:06:56] glorious liberty of the children of God.
[1:06:59] Verse 22. For we know that the whole
[1:07:02] creation groanth and travaleth in pain
[1:07:06] together until now. And not only they,
[1:07:09] but ourselves also, which have the first
[1:07:12] fruits of the spirit, even we ourselves
[1:07:16] grown within ourselves, waiting for the
[1:07:19] adoption to the redemption of our body.
[1:07:25] So now remember, in order for that
[1:07:28] groaning, as Paul would write there in
[1:07:30] verse 23, that groaning is a groaning
[1:07:33] for that of that life of that of that
[1:07:36] other land. It's a it's a desire.
[1:07:38] There's a homesick. There's a desire for
[1:07:41] that other land. And you know, the only
[1:07:42] way that that can be there is you have
[1:07:45] to have the spirit of that land inside
[1:07:48] of you. Amen. Hallelujah. That's what
[1:07:51] separates. That's what that's what
[1:07:53] separates everything to where that that
[1:07:56] you know it's not a longing you know
[1:07:58] look let me just let me let me slow down
[1:08:00] just for a minute we we enjoy life here
[1:08:03] you should enjoy life when I say should
[1:08:06] and there might be some things that can
[1:08:07] kind of hinder that along the way so I
[1:08:09] don't want you to take that wrong but
[1:08:11] God God is mindful to provide for us so
[1:08:14] that you and I are able to move through
[1:08:18] this life manifesting his victory in
[1:08:21] every situation
[1:08:22] Because there's some real devastating
[1:08:24] things that can come our way.
[1:08:27] There's some things that can shatter
[1:08:28] you.
[1:08:31] Are you hearing me? So, we're not
[1:08:32] talking about being superheroes where
[1:08:34] things don't affect us, but we're
[1:08:36] talking about where that groaning on the
[1:08:38] inside. Listen, friends, there should be
[1:08:40] a desire to to for the rapture and a
[1:08:43] longing for the coming of the Lord more
[1:08:45] than ever anything else. Right. And and
[1:08:48] I tell you, you know, if if we're if
[1:08:50] we're lined up that way, remember, it's
[1:08:52] like that bone that sat. If we're lined
[1:08:54] up that way, then everything else will
[1:08:56] fall in line. God did not mean for you
[1:08:59] and I to walk around and worry and
[1:09:02] perplex and looking at everything all
[1:09:04] around us. Let me just say this to you.
[1:09:05] You might think I'm far out, but the
[1:09:07] Bible said, "Seek you first. The kingdom
[1:09:09] of God and his righteousness, and all
[1:09:12] these other things will be added to
[1:09:13] you." I tell you, if I were finding my
[1:09:16] life and finding things being consumed
[1:09:18] around me and I'm looking for this and
[1:09:20] looking for that, let me tell you,
[1:09:22] you'll never be able with yourself to to
[1:09:24] put things all together. But if you can
[1:09:27] look, step back into the hands of God
[1:09:30] and say, "Lord, this is where I want to
[1:09:32] be aligned up first." That's why the
[1:09:33] prophet said, he said, "If you get lined
[1:09:35] up and you get in the will of God, then
[1:09:37] the family will get in the will of God."
[1:09:40] Because the will of God is God's desire
[1:09:43] for our lives. So, in other words, it's
[1:09:46] things that we can step back and say,
[1:09:47] "God, line me up." Because why? Our
[1:09:50] lives were meant to be filled with the
[1:09:52] peace of God.
[1:09:56] Are you hearing me? Amen.
[1:09:59] Now 2 Corinthians 5 verse one. For we
[1:10:04] know that if this earthly house of this
[1:10:05] tabernacle were dissolved, we have a
[1:10:08] building of God, a house not made with
[1:10:10] hands, eternal in the heavens. For in
[1:10:13] this in this body we grown earnestly,
[1:10:16] desiring to be clothed upon with our
[1:10:19] house which is from heaven. He's talking
[1:10:22] about that theophony body. If so be that
[1:10:25] being clothed, we shall not be found
[1:10:28] naked.
[1:10:30] For we that are in this tabernacle do
[1:10:33] grown, being burdened, not for that we
[1:10:35] would be unclothed, but clothed upon
[1:10:38] that mortality might be swallowed up of
[1:10:41] life. Now he that hath wrought us for
[1:10:44] the self, sames thing is God who hath
[1:10:47] given unto us the earnest of the spirit.
[1:10:50] Now think about it. Here we were, you
[1:10:53] know, we can fellowship on this of where
[1:10:55] we were within our lives and how God
[1:10:58] really be to deal with our hearts. I
[1:11:00] mean, you know, uh, we could have sat
[1:11:02] within a message church or you sat
[1:11:04] within a church or for for a period of
[1:11:06] time, but all of a sudden when God
[1:11:08] begins to deal with your heart and you
[1:11:10] begin to see yourself in a light of that
[1:11:12] that I am a sinner and I am lost, I I
[1:11:16] need God. I I need the mercy of almighty
[1:11:19] God. What's happening? the Holy Spirit
[1:11:21] moving upon our life that causes us to
[1:11:25] groan for that life, that true life of
[1:11:29] the Holy Ghost that will set you and I
[1:11:33] free from that old sinful nature. And
[1:11:36] then when that life has come in, then
[1:11:38] that life on the inside is what causes
[1:11:41] us to groan and long for knowing there
[1:11:45] is a place. There is a land beyond the
[1:11:48] river. Amen. It it brings us back into
[1:11:51] that place like Abraham and Sarah where
[1:11:53] we are regarded as pilgrims and
[1:11:56] strangers.
[1:11:58] Are you with me? Because you know once
[1:12:02] in a while there's things that come our
[1:12:03] way in our lives. Even when sickness
[1:12:06] comes around, situations come around.
[1:12:09] You know what it is? It's a reminder
[1:12:11] this is not our final dwelling place.
[1:12:14] And you might say, "Well, well, brother
[1:12:16] Samuel, it seems like it comes in
[1:12:17] seasons." That's exactly right. In the
[1:12:20] book of in the book of Acts, the Bible
[1:12:22] would go through the book of Acts and
[1:12:24] you can see there would be hard
[1:12:25] persecutions at times and then the Bible
[1:12:27] said then the churches had rest.
[1:12:31] So there was seasons, right? There's
[1:12:34] seasons that we go through and not every
[1:12:37] season just like in our four seasons,
[1:12:39] not everybody likes certain seasons. You
[1:12:42] know, everybody, some people like this
[1:12:44] season, some like this season, and
[1:12:45] there's some seasons we don't care for.
[1:12:47] Sometimes that changes with age, and
[1:12:49] maybe it's just personal likes or
[1:12:51] dislikes or whatever, but that all
[1:12:53] changes. And we can realize this. It's
[1:12:55] just like where we're at right now. You
[1:12:57] know, you get a little warm, then it
[1:12:58] gets cold, then it gets warm, then it
[1:13:00] gets cold. And and we realize we know
[1:13:02] where we're standing even by looking at
[1:13:05] the calendar. It's coming. The days of
[1:13:08] warmth are coming.
[1:13:10] There's little things dropping here and
[1:13:12] there. We realize it's coming and
[1:13:14] there's an expectation that begins to
[1:13:17] build in our lives.
[1:13:20] Now, there are times that I want to I
[1:13:22] want to deal with this here and I want
[1:13:25] to look at this this portion or this
[1:13:28] thought in here and I want to go to
[1:13:30] Psalms 10 142 and verse one and I want
[1:13:33] to look at this part on a broken
[1:13:35] spirit.
[1:13:37] Remember, it's one thing how God will
[1:13:40] heal the
[1:13:42] soul. And I thank God for it, but
[1:13:46] sometimes when the spirit itself, the
[1:13:48] spirit of man, because we are a three-
[1:13:50] room house, right? We are body, spirit,
[1:13:54] and soul. Your body has five senses.
[1:13:57] Your spirit has five gates. Reason,
[1:14:00] conscience, memory, affection, it has
[1:14:03] five gates. Is that right?
[1:14:06] The soul only has one. Is he of faith or
[1:14:08] doubt?
[1:14:10] So now I want you just to look at this
[1:14:13] here in the scripture. Psalms 142 and
[1:14:15] verse one. Here is David. And David,
[1:14:19] remember this scripture that we're going
[1:14:21] to read. David is being pursued like a
[1:14:24] dog.
[1:14:27] Let's just read it here. He said, "I
[1:14:29] cried unto the Lord with my voice, with
[1:14:32] my voice unto the Lord, did I make my
[1:14:35] supplication. I poured out my complaint
[1:14:37] before him. I showed before him my
[1:14:40] trouble. When my spirit was overwhelmed
[1:14:44] within me, then thou kneest my path."
[1:14:46] Now, this is very key. My spirit was
[1:14:49] overwhelmed or turned aside. Right? I'm
[1:14:54] sure every one of us you've seen or
[1:14:57] experienced or even feeling it in
[1:14:59] yourself sometimes when you can look at
[1:15:00] somebody else say they're not their
[1:15:02] self.
[1:15:04] They're not they're not their self. I
[1:15:06] mean I see them and you see like little
[1:15:07] glimpses here and there sometimes of
[1:15:09] coming out and you realize there's
[1:15:11] there's a there's a distress. There's
[1:15:13] something that is just not setting just
[1:15:17] right. No matter how much they tell you
[1:15:19] it's all right, everything's okay. But
[1:15:22] you can sense it. You know why? Because
[1:15:24] your body can't lie.
[1:15:27] It's all connected.
[1:15:29] It'll all come out. And David said,
[1:15:32] "When my spirit was overwhelmed," now
[1:15:34] let me mind remind you now. He's already
[1:15:37] been anointed king.
[1:15:41] He's already seen many battles. He's
[1:15:44] already defeated Goliath.
[1:15:48] He has already defeated a lion and a
[1:15:50] bear. Right. But this was a different
[1:15:53] thing that he was
[1:15:55] facing where the very man that he had
[1:15:58] helped, the very man that he had
[1:16:01] ministered to now that man had become
[1:16:04] anointed with an evil spirit.
[1:16:08] And really it was jealousy.
[1:16:12] Right. David could play and the spirit
[1:16:14] would leave Saul.
[1:16:17] Right. And when then all of a sudden
[1:16:19] when the spirit would come back, he pick
[1:16:20] up that javelin. He he didn't listen. He
[1:16:23] wasn't playing darts.
[1:16:25] If he would have caught David and he and
[1:16:28] many times David escaped out of that,
[1:16:30] it's a miracle. David kept on going
[1:16:32] back. You know why? You know what that
[1:16:34] was all about? That was not a fairy
[1:16:36] tale. That was a believer that had
[1:16:39] discernment of spirit
[1:16:43] and was able to separate between the
[1:16:46] evil spirit and that Saul my king.
[1:16:50] Are you hearing me? Remember David was
[1:16:53] encouraged. Take him man. Everything
[1:16:55] will be good right here. Everything will
[1:16:58] just just just get rid of him. You see
[1:17:01] this is where it's important. Let me
[1:17:03] just say it to you like this. This is an
[1:17:05] old old saying, but it's true. I found
[1:17:07] it to be very
[1:17:08] true. David was a man that was
[1:17:11] experiencing brokenness in his spirit.
[1:17:14] That's so good. And here's the danger.
[1:17:17] Sometimes with hurting is sometimes hurt
[1:17:20] people hurt people. Oh yeah. Right. You
[1:17:24] find you find a you know like like our
[1:17:27] other dog that we had uh you know before
[1:17:30] what we have now you know he on one of
[1:17:32] his um claws that that thing had come
[1:17:35] off and I don't know why why it come off
[1:17:37] like that and I mean he was he was
[1:17:39] nothing but a teddy bear. Now I know
[1:17:40] some people say that about their dogs
[1:17:42] and they ain't got no teddy
[1:17:44] bear. It's like lions and
[1:17:47] tigers. But I mean he was a teddy bear.
[1:17:51] He would let me do anything. Brother
[1:17:52] Joey. But when that happened to him like
[1:17:54] that, I went to try to help him. I went
[1:17:57] to try to take that off because all you
[1:17:58] seen was that quit sticking out. I'm
[1:18:00] tell he he turned back and he snapped at
[1:18:03] me, but you know, making sure he didn't
[1:18:04] get in my hand. I didn't know what to
[1:18:06] do. You know, my brother told me I said,
[1:18:08] "Hey, I don't know what to do." He said,
[1:18:10] "Just put him in his crate. He'll take
[1:18:12] care of it."
[1:18:14] And you know, sometimes that works.
[1:18:17] Yeah, that's good. Sometimes that works
[1:18:20] to where that we can just get into a
[1:18:23] place like that and you know but but God
[1:18:26] when that healing would come but God
[1:18:28] knows just exactly how how to bring
[1:18:30] healing to our life. But my point was is
[1:18:32] that he would have never done that. And
[1:18:35] sometimes when you're dealing with
[1:18:36] things that when there's hurt in
[1:18:38] people's lives, sometimes the things
[1:18:40] that are lashed out is because of hurt.
[1:18:43] That's right there. I tell you, it's a
[1:18:45] miracle that David didn't take Saul's
[1:18:48] life.
[1:18:51] Are you hearing me? If David would have
[1:18:53] had Facebook, he would have been
[1:18:55] tempted,
[1:18:58] right? Instagram or whatever more. But
[1:19:02] listen, friends, this is this is reality
[1:19:04] of where we're at. His spirit was
[1:19:06] overwhelmed,
[1:19:08] right? It was turned aside.
[1:19:11] That's what overwhelm means. right in
[1:19:14] the way. And watch what he said. But
[1:19:16] then thou kneest my path. In other
[1:19:18] words, God, you never lost sight of me.
[1:19:20] Hallelujah. Amen. When my spirit was
[1:19:23] wandering, but you never lost sight of
[1:19:26] me.
[1:19:28] In the way wherein I have walked, they
[1:19:30] have probably laid a snare for me. I
[1:19:33] looked on my right hand, behold, there
[1:19:35] was no man that would know me. Refuge
[1:19:38] failed me. No man cared for my soul. I
[1:19:40] cried unto thee, oh Lord. I said, "Thou
[1:19:43] art my refuge." Oh, that's so key. Thou
[1:19:46] art my refuge and my portion in the land
[1:19:50] of the living. This was a man whose
[1:19:52] spirit was turned aside.
[1:19:56] Attend unto my cry, for I am brought
[1:19:59] very low. Deliver me from my
[1:20:01] persecutors, for they are stronger than
[1:20:03] I. Bring my soul out of prison, that I
[1:20:07] may praise thy name. The righteous shall
[1:20:09] compass me about for thou shalt deal
[1:20:12] bountifully with me.
[1:20:15] Bring my soul out of prison, Lord. I'm
[1:20:18] just not myself. Oh my. Sometimes you
[1:20:21] can remember back and look back and say,
[1:20:23] "Oh, oh, I remember how it was months
[1:20:26] ago. My it seemed like what liberty I
[1:20:28] had and what joy I had and what freedom
[1:20:31] I had and what this but and sometimes
[1:20:33] you can't even seem to put your finger
[1:20:36] on it as why has my spirit my
[1:20:39] countenance why is this broken?
[1:20:43] Sometimes there are things that we do
[1:20:45] know and there are experiences as I'll
[1:20:48] get into a few here in a moment from the
[1:20:49] message. But there's other times
[1:20:54] David had no idea how long he was going
[1:20:58] to be pursued.
[1:21:02] But let me just tell you
[1:21:03] something. This is why it's always it's
[1:21:07] always something to look
[1:21:09] at. David's behavior during this time
[1:21:13] when he was in this condition, he
[1:21:16] behaved himself wisely.
[1:21:20] That's that's how Saul knew eventually
[1:21:24] this guy's this guy's going to be the
[1:21:26] king. He's the one he had taken thy
[1:21:29] anointing and given it to thy friend. It
[1:21:32] was his conduct. How many believe that
[1:21:35] the Holy Ghost is able to give us a real
[1:21:37] conduct?
[1:21:38] I believe that. I believe listen if he
[1:21:41] can he he can change our nature. He can
[1:21:44] listen miracles, signs and wonders can
[1:21:46] be done. He's still the God that can
[1:21:49] move right down and give us strength in
[1:21:51] our lives, give us a real patience and
[1:21:54] temperance and godliness. He He's the
[1:21:56] same God to do that. Now, watch this.
[1:21:58] Here is in Isaiah 53. He is despised.
[1:22:02] Looking to the Messiah coming. This is
[1:22:05] what he was going to experience. He was
[1:22:06] going to experience being despised. He
[1:22:08] was going to experience being rejected
[1:22:10] of men. Right? In other words,
[1:22:13] relationships broken. Yeah. That's good.
[1:22:16] A man of
[1:22:19] sorrows and acquainted with grief.
[1:22:22] That's right.
[1:22:24] And we hid as it were our faces from
[1:22:26] him. He was despised and we esteemed him
[1:22:30] not. Brother Brandon says like this. He
[1:22:32] says in marriage of the lamb, he said,
[1:22:34] "Forgive our sins and our trespasses. We
[1:22:37] ask again and we remember those that
[1:22:39] raised their hands." And down beneath
[1:22:40] that hand, Lord, was the was a heart
[1:22:42] requesting something from thee. And
[1:22:44] perhaps maybe only thee alone could give
[1:22:46] it. I pray that you'll grant it, Father.
[1:22:48] Whatever they have need of, give it to
[1:22:50] them in abundance. There may be sick,
[1:22:53] Lord, heal them. If there be any that's
[1:22:55] fallen by the wayside, strengthen that
[1:22:57] one, that feeble one. A bruised reed he
[1:23:00] will not break. Or a smoking flax he
[1:23:03] will not clench. And we know that he
[1:23:05] would never turn away a bruised reed. He
[1:23:08] would mend it. And I pray, heavenly
[1:23:11] father, if there be any spirits that's
[1:23:13] broken or discouraged or feeble, hands
[1:23:17] hanging down, knees bagged, may they be
[1:23:21] lifted tonight, Lord. May the Holy
[1:23:23] Spirit come and heal our hearts and
[1:23:27] spirits and our physical beings. And
[1:23:30] we'll give him all the praise.
[1:23:33] Hallelujah. Yes, sir.
[1:23:38] Now the Bible
[1:23:40] says a merry heart maketh a cheerful
[1:23:45] countenance but by sorrow of the
[1:23:49] heart the spirit is broken.
[1:23:54] Sorrow can come in many different ways.
[1:24:01] Sorrow can come through the death of a
[1:24:04] loved one.
[1:24:06] Sometimes depending on maybe that death
[1:24:09] is something what we would call
[1:24:12] natural. Then you can have sorrow that
[1:24:15] can come from a
[1:24:17] tragedy. Then you can have sorrow that
[1:24:20] can come from relationships that maybe
[1:24:24] and I'm not just talking about
[1:24:25] relationship between man and woman, boy
[1:24:27] and girl. I'm talking about
[1:24:28] relationships that sometimes that can go
[1:24:31] in a certain direction and sorrow can
[1:24:34] set in and the spirit itself becomes
[1:24:36] broken. Let me just tell you what
[1:24:38] happens when a spirit becomes broken.
[1:24:41] It's as though you could light all the
[1:24:43] fires you want and it's not going to
[1:24:45] move anything down the road. And
[1:24:47] sometimes you're looking at we just need
[1:24:48] to build the fire bigger. It ain't going
[1:24:50] to do nothing. Right? You see what's got
[1:24:53] to happen is is ministering to that
[1:24:56] spirit. Right?
[1:24:58] Are you hearing me? It's where the
[1:25:00] spirit itself because look look friends
[1:25:02] sometimes in things we we have the right
[1:25:05] desire of well I want to see things
[1:25:07] turned around. I want to see this change
[1:25:09] or I want to see that and and sometimes
[1:25:11] sometimes what it is is we're looking
[1:25:13] for quick fixes on things and saying
[1:25:15] snap out of this. But these are things
[1:25:17] that at times you just can't go it needs
[1:25:19] to be snapped out of. We have to be led
[1:25:23] back to the place of soundness.
[1:25:27] So God God listen, he's the ultimate.
[1:25:30] It's not, you know, it's not me and
[1:25:32] Brother Dave sinking together or me and
[1:25:34] Brother Joey or somebody, but it's God
[1:25:36] by his presence is the one that lines us
[1:25:39] back up. You know how it is.
[1:25:42] Look on this iPad I got or my iPhone,
[1:25:46] you know what happens if if all of a
[1:25:48] sudden something comes and it wipes
[1:25:50] everything off my phone?
[1:25:54] You say, "Well, you got to get a new
[1:25:55] phone." Not necessarily. Let me tell you
[1:25:58] what happens. Or my
[1:26:00] computer. Everything that I'm doing
[1:26:02] right here is based off of the cloud.
[1:26:08] Everything is backed up to the cloud.
[1:26:09] That's why no matter if I'm in a
[1:26:11] doctor's office on my phone, I'm working
[1:26:13] as though I'm on my computer. Same
[1:26:15] files, same thing, pulling quotes and
[1:26:17] everything else. I because it just goes
[1:26:18] the same. But so what happens is if
[1:26:21] something goes wrong, you know what I
[1:26:22] have to do? I have to get back in
[1:26:24] contact with the cloud.
[1:26:26] And the cloud has all of the data stored
[1:26:29] on there. All the messages, all the
[1:26:31] cloud, all the files, everything. So, I
[1:26:34] didn't lose anything. I might have lost
[1:26:36] access, but all I got to do is get
[1:26:39] everything back in contact with the
[1:26:42] cloud. And that's the same way about our
[1:26:44] lives. Sometimes, sometimes our lives,
[1:26:47] it comes like a blank screen. things
[1:26:50] aren't firing the way that it needs to
[1:26:52] be firing. But let me just tell you
[1:26:54] something. There's a cloud
[1:26:57] and in that cloud, it has your real
[1:27:00] identity. In that cloud, it has the
[1:27:03] revelation of who you really are.
[1:27:05] Listen, that's what's been put in your
[1:27:07] heart already.
[1:27:11] David said, "When my spirit was
[1:27:13] overwhelmed, then thou kneest my way."
[1:27:16] It was already there, Lord. Even though
[1:27:19] I I've been broken, but that has not
[1:27:23] been broken.
[1:27:27] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:27:30] Sometimes a broken
[1:27:33] spirit like you don't feel like doing
[1:27:35] anything,
[1:27:38] right? Sometimes you see no end in
[1:27:40] sight. Maybe it's goal. Maybe it's in
[1:27:42] college. Maybe it's in school. Sometimes
[1:27:43] the you just
[1:27:44] just broken
[1:27:47] sometimes with things that maybe we've
[1:27:49] looked at as failure and this didn't
[1:27:51] turn out or that or whatever and you can
[1:27:53] become broken.
[1:27:55] Come on friends, I'm preaching now.
[1:27:58] You can become broken and it just
[1:28:00] becomes just like, you know, just
[1:28:02] sitting around and think, let me tell
[1:28:03] you, we're living in a time in an hour
[1:28:07] with depression and anxiety, but let me
[1:28:09] tell you, it's no match for the blood of
[1:28:12] Jesus Christ.
[1:28:16] Let me just tell you something. You
[1:28:17] might have a son or daughter. You might
[1:28:19] have family member and you're saying
[1:28:21] they're dealing with that. Let me just
[1:28:22] tell you something. You make sure and
[1:28:25] let your life be an absolute.
[1:28:28] Let your life be an absolute. What do
[1:28:31] you mean by an absolute? Let it be a
[1:28:33] testimony of the promise of God that God
[1:28:36] is real. He's alive. He keeps his word
[1:28:39] and stay there as a point of contact.
[1:28:42] Amen.
[1:28:44] For God to work through. That's true.
[1:28:47] Y'all understand what I'm saying? Amen.
[1:28:49] I'm not saying to put yourself in a
[1:28:50] dangerous situation or, you know, or
[1:28:52] something you're drugged down. I'm just
[1:28:54] trying to tell you that you got to
[1:28:55] remember it's going to have to be God,
[1:28:57] but God will work through you to
[1:28:59] minister just as he ministers to our
[1:29:02] life. Now, look how Job described this.
[1:29:05] He Now, Job, you remember Job's thinking
[1:29:07] wasn't right. Job was thinking this was
[1:29:10] God doing it. So he says this, but some
[1:29:12] of the statements he says are are true
[1:29:14] in this light that the poison thereof
[1:29:17] drinkketh up my spirit. It wasn't the
[1:29:19] almighty doing it. God had permitted it.
[1:29:22] But notice just the things that had
[1:29:25] happened around Job's life. Broken
[1:29:28] family, right? Are you hearing me?
[1:29:32] Things taken away. I mean, you taken the
[1:29:35] the economic resources and and things
[1:29:38] things had been changed about his life.
[1:29:41] And it wasn't just gradual. It was one
[1:29:43] right after the other. And Job is
[1:29:45] talking about it's drinking up my
[1:29:47] spirit. Remember remember what his wife
[1:29:50] come out and said, "I've been seeing you
[1:29:52] sitting on that couch day in and day out
[1:29:55] and you're scraping your your boils with
[1:29:57] a puncher. Why don't you get up and do
[1:29:59] something? And if you're not, just curse
[1:30:01] God and die." Right?
[1:30:04] And Job said, "Thou speakest like a
[1:30:06] foolish woman." Hallelujah.
[1:30:10] Job 7:11, "Therefore, I will not refrain
[1:30:13] with my mouth. I will speak in the
[1:30:15] anguish of my spirit." His spirit was
[1:30:19] troubled. Right? Listen, he didn't lose
[1:30:22] his standing with God. Right? What God
[1:30:26] already what God remember God said,
[1:30:28] "Have you considered my servant Job?"
[1:30:30] He's perfect. He was looking through the
[1:30:32] sacrifice.
[1:30:34] Job said, "My grief is not a savage." In
[1:30:37] other words, it's not removed. It's not
[1:30:39] taken away. Job 2:14, "As from me is my
[1:30:43] complaint to man, if it were so, my why
[1:30:46] should not my spirit be troubled."
[1:30:50] Job's spirit was troubled.
[1:30:54] You know what Job had experienced? Job
[1:30:57] had experienced grief.
[1:31:00] Let me remind you the prophet said it
[1:31:02] over and over. He said Jesus did not die
[1:31:04] from a spear.
[1:31:07] He said because when they brought the
[1:31:09] spear to his side, water and blood came
[1:31:11] out. He said that was already separated
[1:31:14] in his body. And he said what brought
[1:31:17] that is is the extreme grief that he
[1:31:21] experienced.
[1:31:23] He experienced the Bible said that even
[1:31:25] that on his brow was like drops of
[1:31:27] blood. So the prophet says over and
[1:31:29] over, he died from a grieving heart.
[1:31:35] Why? You see, he felt the intensity and
[1:31:37] the burden of the sins of the world,
[1:31:40] past, present, and future.
[1:31:43] The very things this morning that you
[1:31:46] can sit here as a sinner or or you and I
[1:31:48] can say, "God, forgive me for maybe a
[1:31:50] wrong attitude or what I've said." He
[1:31:52] already experienced that and bore that
[1:31:55] for you and I. He bore all of our
[1:31:59] transgressions
[1:32:02] and that part of separation. Hallelujah.
[1:32:05] Because he experienced that separation
[1:32:08] in the garden. He grieved. Yes.
[1:32:12] And sometimes on grieving, grieving is
[1:32:15] not just when it comes to dying.
[1:32:18] Grieving sometimes can come when things
[1:32:21] haven't gone our way, relationships or
[1:32:24] things are broken. That's true. And
[1:32:26] sometimes with grieving, let me tell you
[1:32:28] something. This is why many times you
[1:32:31] can read it. I can you go through
[1:32:33] research on it that sometimes we're
[1:32:35] those that are caring for those that are
[1:32:38] in the midst of it. Sometimes with
[1:32:39] family are right in the midst of it. And
[1:32:41] sometimes that family is not even able
[1:32:43] to grieve until afterwards because it's
[1:32:45] focused on the preparation for
[1:32:47] everything.
[1:32:52] And then sometimes with grieving,
[1:32:55] grieving has on it, it's like a bell
[1:32:56] curve,
[1:32:58] it can go from that that part to where
[1:33:01] it's at first where it's, you know, the
[1:33:03] sadness and then all of a sudden it can
[1:33:06] turn to anger.
[1:33:08] And it's anger regarding the situation.
[1:33:12] But anybody who falls within that window
[1:33:15] of their life can experience that anger
[1:33:20] from that situation.
[1:33:23] You say, "Brother Samuel, but we're
[1:33:25] believers, but this guy's not a
[1:33:27] believer." Your human spirit's not a
[1:33:30] believer.
[1:33:31] As a son and daughter of God, we have to
[1:33:33] recognize that our spirits can be
[1:33:35] overwhelmed. Listen, sometimes there's
[1:33:38] things that can happen within a person's
[1:33:40] life and it's though as though a part of
[1:33:42] them died and yet they're still living.
[1:33:44] That's right. So true. It's like a hand
[1:33:47] or something where somebody loses
[1:33:49] ability to function in a certain part.
[1:33:51] They're still here and their hand but
[1:33:53] but they're not able to function. What
[1:33:55] happens? The deadness has set in for
[1:33:58] that flowing and all of those electrons
[1:34:00] and everything firing down through there
[1:34:02] to move those body and they're trying to
[1:34:05] work to get that back. Oh God, I pray
[1:34:08] may the spirit of God move down through
[1:34:10] our lives. Lord, through areas of
[1:34:12] there's places where you say, "I'm just
[1:34:14] not what I was. I know what God intended
[1:34:17] me to be." Maybe your spirit has went
[1:34:19] astray. But God is here in his mercy to
[1:34:24] restore
[1:34:26] to heal.
[1:34:28] Amen.
[1:34:30] That's the truth.
[1:34:33] Let me read you a few examples.
[1:34:40] Brother Bram, it's interesting to me as
[1:34:42] I've studied this over the time because
[1:34:45] there's two different sets of
[1:34:47] twins. One that Brother Bam deals with
[1:34:49] in the early 50s and one's in the 60s.
[1:34:53] Incredible. Same
[1:34:55] things happen within these sets of
[1:34:57] twins, two different sets of
[1:35:00] twins. And here here you have some young
[1:35:04] ladies and they were raised, Brother
[1:35:06] Brandham said, in a very godly home.
[1:35:10] Brother Bram would even use this term.
[1:35:12] He would say that they were
[1:35:15] grounded in the things of God. And
[1:35:18] brother Ramman's speaking to the people
[1:35:20] on Beyond the Curtain of Time, he's
[1:35:23] going to have to go between services and
[1:35:26] needs to visit this one of those
[1:35:28] twins because one of these twins, her
[1:35:30] name is
[1:35:31] Ruthie. Brother Brandon, he'll give
[1:35:34] another account of it in another message
[1:35:36] where he'll describe what takes place.
[1:35:38] And he said when he walked in there to
[1:35:41] her and he said,
[1:35:43] "Ruthie, because if nothing changes,
[1:35:47] she's going to go to the asylum."
[1:35:50] So he walks into the room,
[1:35:53] Ruthie. Do you remember me? You used to
[1:35:56] sit on my knee. You used to call me
[1:35:58] Brutder.
[1:36:00] Bill, do you remember Ruthie? Brother
[1:36:02] Bram says, you could take your hand and
[1:36:05] go like this and with just a stare.
[1:36:10] Sometimes you can go and shake maybe a
[1:36:12] person's hand and it's like you're
[1:36:13] shaking the shell
[1:36:15] of a person. Don't despise that. That's
[1:36:19] good. Just remember sometimes you don't
[1:36:21] know what a person That's right. might
[1:36:24] be dealing with. Right. That's right.
[1:36:27] There's sometimes where we've been a
[1:36:29] shell of a person in different
[1:36:31] situations sometimes with with grieving
[1:36:34] and things that's taking place and we
[1:36:35] really don't know, Lord, how do I get
[1:36:37] out of this? What do I do? But you know
[1:36:39] what? He he not only ministers healing
[1:36:42] to our soul and to our body. He
[1:36:45] ministers healing to our spirit.
[1:36:49] He knows just how to lead that spirit
[1:36:51] right back in line. Remember, brother
[1:36:52] Ram tells us in greatest battle ever
[1:36:54] fought, he said, "If we can get
[1:36:55] everything lined up just right, get you
[1:36:58] get your soul lined up with God. We get
[1:37:00] the spirit." He said, "And the body." He
[1:37:02] said, "We're like a solar system." Is
[1:37:04] that what he said? We're like a solar
[1:37:06] system. What happens when we look at all
[1:37:08] this? God wrote his Bible in the heavens
[1:37:10] at first. Is that right? So when
[1:37:12] everything itself can get lined up and
[1:37:14] some of those things that when we look
[1:37:16] at it with with situations and sometimes
[1:37:18] yes it can be our choices and sometimes
[1:37:20] it's not our choices but regardless
[1:37:23] either way he's still the Lord that
[1:37:25] health all. Amen.
[1:37:28] Now watch how brother Bam says this
[1:37:29] regarding this little girl. He says this
[1:37:31] girl he said there's no physical break
[1:37:33] in the girl. Nothing physically. She's
[1:37:36] perfectly healthy. It's hard to explain.
[1:37:39] It really cannot be explained what it
[1:37:41] is. Her spirit has wandered.
[1:37:45] He says, "See, you got to catch her
[1:37:47] spirit and bring it back to the place."
[1:37:52] So, catching her spirit and bringing it
[1:37:55] back to the place. And now you say,
[1:37:57] "Well, well, how does that happen?"
[1:37:59] Brother Bam tells us how that happens is
[1:38:01] is you have to project the right
[1:38:04] thoughts to her. and not just our human
[1:38:07] thoughts but the thoughts of the word.
[1:38:10] This why brother Bram said you see he
[1:38:12] said this is where something it even
[1:38:14] comes so much deeper and and even
[1:38:16] reaches out even beyond the preaching of
[1:38:18] the word. Brother Bram says you know he
[1:38:20] says it's just like on a break. Now
[1:38:22] watch how he talks about this. He's
[1:38:24] comparing the situation with this young
[1:38:26] girl to Orville Wright. Orville Wright
[1:38:28] is one of Sister Hadtiey's boys. He says
[1:38:30] this is just a break like a nervous
[1:38:32] breakdown. It looked just a few moments
[1:38:34] ago and I gazed back to a little boy
[1:38:36] that had the very same thing. We went
[1:38:38] down there one night at brother Wrights
[1:38:40] and Orville was just in a complete
[1:38:42] break. And you know when he tried to run
[1:38:45] out of the house as good a friend as
[1:38:47] Orville and I are just like like I'd be
[1:38:50] his father. I married his father and
[1:38:52] mother together and he just jumped up
[1:38:55] and screamed, "Get out of here. Get out
[1:38:57] of here. Get out of here."
[1:39:00] And yet
[1:39:01] Orville, Brother Bram, was like a daddy
[1:39:03] to him. They were good
[1:39:07] friends. But something
[1:39:09] happened. Something happened to Orville.
[1:39:15] Brother Bram tells us of what had taken
[1:39:17] place. He said, "We had to go out there
[1:39:19] and get him through the line of spirit
[1:39:21] and catch that boy spirit." A lot of
[1:39:25] grief had come to this little heart.
[1:39:28] He's young. He had seen a lot and just
[1:39:30] we brought him right back to the place
[1:39:32] where he should be and in a few days he
[1:39:35] was all
[1:39:36] right. Now what Orville had seen his
[1:39:39] daddy was an alcoholic
[1:39:42] and his daddy was out driving the
[1:39:44] tractor. Brother Bram tells this in
[1:39:45] different place in the message. My new
[1:39:47] ministry and so forth. He was out there
[1:39:49] driving the tractor and that tractor hit
[1:39:51] a rut. And when it hit that rut, the
[1:39:54] tractor fell over and crushed his daddy.
[1:39:57] And Orville happened to be the one that
[1:39:59] came out there and found him. And when
[1:40:02] he found his daddy
[1:40:05] crushed, it set grief into his heart to
[1:40:09] where he did not even
[1:40:11] recognize the way his response to
[1:40:13] brother Brandham. Get out of here. Get
[1:40:16] out of here. Oh my friends, I wonder
[1:40:18] sometimes of things that when we have
[1:40:20] seen responses, I wonder if we've
[1:40:22] discerned it correctly.
[1:40:25] That is so good. You sometimes what
[1:40:27] grief can do, it can cause responses to
[1:40:30] be in a certain way that even brother
[1:40:32] said horrible mean he was like a daddy.
[1:40:34] He was like a daddy to him. They were
[1:40:36] friends, right? But his spirit had gone
[1:40:39] astray. He had been wounded by an
[1:40:42] experience, a tragedy, something that
[1:40:45] had so broken that spirit. Now, Orville
[1:40:48] didn't have the Holy Ghost at this
[1:40:51] time, but it's not saying that
[1:40:53] somebody's spirit can't go astray, cuz I
[1:40:55] can show you many others after this.
[1:41:00] But it was a little bit after after all
[1:41:02] this happened where the spirit of God
[1:41:05] moved down in Sister Hadtie's home.
[1:41:08] after Orville was straightened out and
[1:41:10] remember she said that ain't nothing but
[1:41:12] the truth, Brother Baron. And the
[1:41:14] anointing of the Lord came in there and
[1:41:16] to both of her boys, right? Amen. Saved
[1:41:19] and filled with the Holy Ghost right
[1:41:20] there. Is that right? Now notice,
[1:41:23] Brother Ram says, "Now concerning the
[1:41:25] little girl," he said, "Now you got to
[1:41:27] do the same thing on this." She said,
[1:41:28] "I've seen it and I know it's true, but
[1:41:30] you know, I" I said, "I request your
[1:41:32] prayer that God will help me to find
[1:41:34] this little girl out into a place where
[1:41:37] she don't know where she's at and then
[1:41:39] to bring her back to this place." And
[1:41:42] that avenue comes through faith. She
[1:41:44] can't have faith for herself. She don't
[1:41:46] know where she's at or anything. It's
[1:41:48] got to take our faith here.
[1:41:54] Turn with me to Psalms 143.
[1:42:04] I'm coming down
[1:42:06] here. I want you to look at this in
[1:42:08] Psalms
[1:42:12] 143, very next chapter.
[1:42:17] David says right here in Psalms
[1:42:21] 143, "Hear my prayer, O Lord, and give
[1:42:23] ear to my supplications. In thy
[1:42:26] faithfulness, answer me, and in thy
[1:42:28] righteousness, and enter not into
[1:42:30] judgment with thy servant. For in thy
[1:42:33] sight shall no man living be justified.
[1:42:37] For the enemy hath persecuted my soul.
[1:42:40] He hath smitten my life down to the
[1:42:42] ground. He hath made me to dwell in
[1:42:44] darkness as those that have been long
[1:42:46] dead. Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed
[1:42:50] within me. My heart within me is
[1:42:53] desolate. I remember the days of old. I
[1:42:56] meditate on all thy works. I muse on the
[1:42:59] work of thy hands. Let me just pause
[1:43:01] here for a
[1:43:02] moment. You know that's powerful to be
[1:43:05] able to remember. Sounds so good. But
[1:43:08] when you remember remember the Lord,
[1:43:10] when you meditate on him, I want you to
[1:43:13] know he's never changed.
[1:43:17] You may not feel him, but he's never
[1:43:19] left you.
[1:43:21] You may not sense things the same way,
[1:43:24] but he never left you. But if you could
[1:43:26] just begin to meditate on his works and
[1:43:29] what he's done in your life, Amen. Amen.
[1:43:33] And know that the same God is present to
[1:43:36] restore the spirit. Amen. Notice what
[1:43:39] David said. I stretch forth my hands
[1:43:41] unto thee. My soul thirsteth after thee
[1:43:44] as a thirsty land. Hear me speedily, oh
[1:43:46] Lord. My spirit faileth. Hide not thy
[1:43:49] face from me, lest I be like them that
[1:43:51] go down into the pit. Let me just say
[1:43:54] this to you.
[1:43:57] This is one of the worst mistakes is
[1:43:59] when you in the midst of failure turn to
[1:44:03] other resources instead of the word of
[1:44:06] God.
[1:44:08] Well, I've had a bad day. Don't expect
[1:44:10] YouTube to edify you.
[1:44:13] Well, I've had a bad day, so you know
[1:44:14] what? I'm just going to go headlong and
[1:44:17] invest in whatever it is you're thinking
[1:44:19] about. Cuz what it is, listen, there's
[1:44:23] always things available to try to divert
[1:44:26] you, but it cannot minister healing to
[1:44:30] you. It will not restore your strength.
[1:44:33] Because listen, I believe this morning
[1:44:35] I'm also ministering to hearts not only
[1:44:37] here, but would be on the internet. Then
[1:44:39] maybe their spirit like Orville, it was
[1:44:42] lined up and they were heading to the
[1:44:44] baptism of the Holy Ghost. But somewhere
[1:44:47] along the line, Satan sidetracked them.
[1:44:50] Yeah. Oh my god. It might have been
[1:44:52] through a heart, through a relationship.
[1:44:54] It might have been through something
[1:44:55] that didn't come out the way they were
[1:44:57] looking at it. Grief hit them. Something
[1:44:59] they don't understand. And Satan just
[1:45:01] wants one moment to try to lead that
[1:45:03] spirit astray.
[1:45:07] Are you hearing me? Brother said he's
[1:45:08] got to get that first nature to agree
[1:45:11] with him. Then he kills it. Then the
[1:45:14] Holy Ghost comes. So Satan can take one
[1:45:17] little thing and lead a life astray. You
[1:45:20] know, Satan can come in and he can lead
[1:45:22] a spirit astray. He listen, he comes
[1:45:26] through instances in situations that
[1:45:28] seem so innocent.
[1:45:33] Whether it's family, whether it's right
[1:45:35] here in the house of
[1:45:37] God. Hey,
[1:45:39] listen. In the book of Zechariah, it
[1:45:42] didn't say wounds came from my from my
[1:45:44] strangers. It said I got wounds in the
[1:45:47] house of my friends.
[1:45:51] I'm not going there today.
[1:45:53] But the spirit of how notice this, this
[1:45:56] is why you don't want to turn to other
[1:45:57] things. Turn to the things of the Lord.
[1:46:00] Are are you hearing me this morning?
[1:46:01] This is why there listen friends, the
[1:46:03] the tendency within our even sometimes
[1:46:06] our our being is to just well I'm just
[1:46:09] going to get this off my mind. But turn
[1:46:11] to the Lord. I'm not saying that even at
[1:46:12] that moment that you got to turn around
[1:46:14] and put on a message or sit down and
[1:46:16] read your Bible, but begin to fellowship
[1:46:18] with the Lord and say, "God, you are my
[1:46:21] refuge. You are my portion, Lord. You're
[1:46:23] my strength. I'm going to turn to you."
[1:46:26] Hallelujah.
[1:46:28] Yes, sir.
[1:46:31] David said in verse eight, "Cause me to
[1:46:34] hear, oh God, cause me to hear thy
[1:46:37] loving kindness in the morning, for
[1:46:40] indeed do I trust. Cause me to know the
[1:46:43] way wherein I should walk, for I lift up
[1:46:45] my soul unto thee. Deliver me, oh Lord,
[1:46:47] from mine enemies. I flee unto thee to
[1:46:49] hide. Teach me to do thy will, for thou
[1:46:52] art my God. Thy spirit is good. Lead me
[1:46:56] into the land of uprightness. Quicken
[1:46:58] me, oh go Lord, for thy name's sake, for
[1:47:01] thy righteousness sake. Bring my soul
[1:47:04] out of trouble and of thy mercy. Cut off
[1:47:07] mine enemies and destroy all them that
[1:47:09] afflict my soul, for I am thy servant.
[1:47:17] Hallelujah.
[1:47:19] How many knows the Bible said he revives
[1:47:22] the spirit of the humble? Yes, he does.
[1:47:25] He revives the heart of the contrite
[1:47:30] ones. Brother Bram even talks in two
[1:47:32] different situations here. Let me close
[1:47:34] on
[1:47:36] these. Here's a
[1:47:38] sister. She's sitting in the back and
[1:47:40] brother says she
[1:47:44] just can't get her breath.
[1:47:47] Nerves have overcome
[1:47:49] her. Brother Bram said, uh, what I had
[1:47:52] to do, he said, now don't try to study
[1:47:53] it. just believe it. He said, "I had to
[1:47:55] go there." He said, "You begin to
[1:47:57] project to her the very thought. You're
[1:48:02] changing her thinking." Now, you might
[1:48:04] think, "Well, that's psychology."
[1:48:05] Brother Brandham says, "When you come in
[1:48:07] here to hear the preaching of the word,
[1:48:10] that's what the preaching of the word
[1:48:11] does. It turns your thoughts to higher
[1:48:14] things."
[1:48:16] Hallelujah. It's not psychology. It's
[1:48:18] the mind of Christ. That's right.
[1:48:22] It's turning our hearts to these things.
[1:48:26] And after a little bit, just getting
[1:48:27] that little that that that little lady
[1:48:30] her spirit and getting it just centered
[1:48:32] around the things of God and just
[1:48:34] centered right back around there,
[1:48:36] everything calmed right back
[1:48:38] down. It's
[1:48:39] centered. This is what God will do
[1:48:43] within a service. This is what God will
[1:48:46] do through our lives.
[1:48:48] Sometimes that healing of the spirit, it
[1:48:51] don't come just like that. Cuz remember,
[1:48:53] there are miracles and then there's also
[1:48:56] divine healing
[1:48:59] where there's times of things that can
[1:49:02] be
[1:49:02] healed. It heals and God begins to work
[1:49:05] and it comes to pass in its own time.
[1:49:09] Think how Satan did this to a young man.
[1:49:11] He just gotten married. Brother Brham
[1:49:14] says how that they went away on their
[1:49:16] honeymoon. we're almost to the east
[1:49:17] coast and all of a sudden he said Satan
[1:49:20] got jumped on him and wanted to build
[1:49:22] back a complex. Now, complex is a way of
[1:49:25] thinking. He said they turned right
[1:49:27] around and came right back. And when
[1:49:29] brother Brandham pulled in close to
[1:49:31] midnight, here they were standing in the
[1:49:32] driveway,
[1:49:34] his little wife. And here they were
[1:49:36] supposed to be on their honeymoon, just
[1:49:37] ringing her hands. Said, "I don't know
[1:49:40] what's happened to him. I don't know
[1:49:41] what's wrong. I don't know what's
[1:49:43] happened." Brother Brandham began to
[1:49:45] just talk with him just a little bit.
[1:49:48] And what it was, Satan was trying to
[1:49:49] build back a complex, trying to lead him
[1:49:53] astray as far as within his spirit. But
[1:49:56] God, rich in mercy,
[1:49:59] moved down and brought healing to that
[1:50:01] young man. And brother Bram said, "Here
[1:50:04] they said this morning."
[1:50:07] Now,
[1:50:09] I just say it in this way here this
[1:50:11] morning. God heals the broken spirit.
[1:50:16] And you know, friends, the thing of it
[1:50:18] is is that healing itself, it can never
[1:50:21] come until we recognize we need it.
[1:50:26] Sometimes there's certain things in
[1:50:28] areas of our life that you might say,
[1:50:30] "Well, I don't know if I want healing in
[1:50:32] that area of my life." But listen,
[1:50:33] listen, you need healing, right? But
[1:50:36] don't try in your mind to think of what
[1:50:39] healing means.
[1:50:42] Let God bring healing to your life and
[1:50:46] let him interpret it. Let him bring
[1:50:48] meaning to it in your heart. Let God
[1:50:51] restore that that spirit that maybe has
[1:50:54] wondered. Let him bring it right back in
[1:50:56] linemen because I've I've witnessed this
[1:50:59] friends as as a pastor here now God
[1:51:02] carries it'll be 23 years and sometimes
[1:51:04] these things what's become more and more
[1:51:05] clear with different things. There's
[1:51:07] times where it's the spirit itself that
[1:51:09] has wandered and it's been broken and
[1:51:13] you can look and say, "I don't see
[1:51:15] what's wrong with so and so. Why aren't
[1:51:17] they acting the same? Why isn't this?"
[1:51:20] And you
[1:51:22] know, this is why I think if there's one
[1:51:25] thing among many things to bring out of
[1:51:27] a service like
[1:51:28] this is don't be quick to jump to
[1:51:31] conclusions.
[1:51:34] Because you can misjudge a lot of
[1:51:38] situations and you don't know what a
[1:51:40] person is going through, but if you
[1:51:41] notice something, that's a time to take
[1:51:43] them in prayer.
[1:51:46] Yes, sir. That's a time to be in prayer
[1:51:47] for them. If you notice, well, they seem
[1:51:49] like they ain't acting their same way or
[1:51:50] they ain't acting theirel. Sometimes
[1:51:52] their spirit has wandered. There's
[1:51:54] brokenness that's come in there. You may
[1:51:56] not know what that brokenness is. And
[1:51:57] it's not that you have to know what that
[1:51:59] is, but just to know that God, God, you
[1:52:02] are able and more than enough to bring
[1:52:05] healing to my brother, to my sister.
[1:52:09] I tell you, he's the same God for
[1:52:10] Orville as he was for Orville, right?
[1:52:13] He's the same God for that little
[1:52:16] sister. He was the same God for that
[1:52:18] little that little that young lady 17 18
[1:52:20] years
[1:52:21] old. And he led her back.
[1:52:25] And she came right out of there within a
[1:52:27] few hours out of that out of that place
[1:52:29] where they had her.
[1:52:33] He's the same God. Yes, he is. Amen.
[1:52:36] He's the same God. You believe that?
[1:52:38] That can go down and listen. Just even
[1:52:41] to ask him, Lord, heal my spirit.
[1:52:46] Heal me, Lord. If there's there's
[1:52:47] something that's been let Heal me, Lord.
[1:52:50] I need healing, Lord. I need I need a
[1:52:52] touch. I need strength. I need a place
[1:52:53] to where a doctor's needle can't go. It
[1:52:57] it can't stitch that up, Lord. I need
[1:52:59] your touch. I need your healing. I need
[1:53:03] your strength, Lord God. If God did it
[1:53:06] for little Orville,
[1:53:09] wouldn't God do it for you?
[1:53:12] If God did it for brother Brandham when
[1:53:14] he was at a place of just ready to walk
[1:53:16] away and go up in the mountains,
[1:53:17] wouldn't he do it for you? That's right.
[1:53:20] Yes, sir. Hallelujah. He's still the
[1:53:24] same almighty God. He's never forgot
[1:53:27] about you. Just remember, he has never
[1:53:31] lost sight of you.
[1:53:33] And though you might feel different, you
[1:53:35] might think different, but I want to
[1:53:36] remind you, Satan can't change the
[1:53:40] contents that are in the cloud.
[1:53:46] Are you hearing me? Amen. It's like in
[1:53:48] the time of Jeremiah, there was they
[1:53:50] placed an inheritance and they sealed
[1:53:52] they had it in a sealed vessel and they
[1:53:55] had an open vessel. the open vessel.
[1:53:58] There was all sorts of things somebody
[1:54:00] could go along and change and change
[1:54:02] out, erase this and change this out, but
[1:54:04] they couldn't change what was sealed.
[1:54:08] So, they could say, "Oh, this and this
[1:54:09] and this and this and that." There's
[1:54:11] been a lot of things that's tried to
[1:54:12] change the openness of our life, but the
[1:54:16] real identity is in the sealed document.
[1:54:19] And the sealed document said, "You were
[1:54:22] always a son and daughter of God." Yes.
[1:54:25] Might have been a lot of things that
[1:54:26] happened along life's way, but this is
[1:54:29] who you really are. The sealed vessel,
[1:54:32] hallelujah, holds your true inheritance.
[1:54:35] Amen. Amen. It speaks better things than
[1:54:39] the open vessel. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:54:42] Do you love him this morning?
[1:54:44] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:54:47] musicians if you come.
[1:54:52] Oh, may God may his mercy may it just
[1:54:55] even search our heart even as
[1:54:57] we in just a little bit would leave the
[1:55:00] the presence of one another and depart
[1:55:02] out of this building. But oh friends,
[1:55:04] let's just let's be real before
[1:55:07] God. Lord, I I want to I want to be back
[1:55:10] to myself. Maybe maybe this is just to
[1:55:12] one person.
[1:55:13] God would do this just for one person.
[1:55:15] Amen.
[1:55:19] You can see this service a little bit
[1:55:22] different from last service, but he's
[1:55:23] the same God.
[1:55:25] See God building our faith within
[1:55:27] healing and and just, you know,
[1:55:28] encouraging and taking those things last
[1:55:30] week and then then here he would come
[1:55:32] and deal with begin to deal with certain
[1:55:34] parts in healing of a broken
[1:55:37] spirit. something that would just you
[1:55:39] just feel
[1:55:40] dejected, maybe despised, maybe rejected
[1:55:44] or
[1:55:46] sorrow. But I can I say this to you,
[1:55:49] he's a high priest that can be touched
[1:55:51] by the feeling of your infirmities.
[1:55:52] Amen.
[1:55:54] But I'll tell you what, his desire is
[1:55:57] not that we would sit around and be
[1:56:01] filled with sadness. You say, "How?" But
[1:56:03] Sammy, how do you know that?
[1:56:04] Well, a lot of scriptures, but let me
[1:56:07] give you one out of Luke
[1:56:09] 24. They were so
[1:56:12] sad. The prophet used the terminology,
[1:56:16] the term bewildered.
[1:56:19] They were bewildered. They didn't know
[1:56:21] what to do. That Peter just said, "You
[1:56:24] know what? Let's go back fishing. I
[1:56:28] don't know what to do. Things have not
[1:56:30] worked out like I thought. We thought it
[1:56:33] should have been him. Why is all this
[1:56:34] happened? Why is all these things taking
[1:56:37] place?
[1:56:39] They were sad in their communications.
[1:56:43] But there had to be something that he
[1:56:47] heard and he drew near.
[1:56:51] That's right.
[1:56:54] He didn't stay away, but he drew near.
[1:56:58] Amen. And he started to walk with them
[1:57:01] in the sadness of their communications.
[1:57:05] And you know what he began to do? He
[1:57:07] just begin to lay things out right
[1:57:10] according to the word. And so what they
[1:57:13] could begin to
[1:57:14] see, wow, these things that's happened,
[1:57:18] these are things that's God's been in it
[1:57:20] the whole time. Are you hearing me?
[1:57:24] God's been in. He's been in you and with
[1:57:28] you the whole time. Not that everything
[1:57:31] that has happened has been good, but all
[1:57:34] things work together
[1:57:37] for the good to them who are called
[1:57:39] according to his purpose.
[1:57:41] And he begin to walk with
[1:57:43] them. And what happened? Their sadness
[1:57:47] begin to break. What was happening?
[1:57:51] Catching their spirit.
[1:57:53] and he was bringing it right back in
[1:57:57] line with the word of
[1:58:00] God and he kept on working with
[1:58:03] them. I the Bible said they walked a few
[1:58:07] furlongings miles and finally they said
[1:58:12] will you come in and when he got on the
[1:58:14] inside he did something that they
[1:58:17] recognized this is him. Hallelujah.
[1:58:21] Same one that made their hearts to burn.
[1:58:23] The same one that caught their sorrow,
[1:58:26] caught their sadness and brought it
[1:58:28] right back around. The word
[1:58:31] because that's where healing is
[1:58:34] in the word of God.
[1:58:37] And you know what it did for them? It
[1:58:40] took people that were sad, the
[1:58:42] communication, and it caused them to now
[1:58:45] look forward with a
[1:58:48] real
[1:58:50] assurance of the outpouring of the Holy
[1:58:54] Ghost. And I think how brother Brandham,
[1:58:56] he takes it like this. Here was a here
[1:58:58] was a sister that came up and rejected
[1:59:00] King. Brother Rams just talked told that
[1:59:03] the previous there in the morning about
[1:59:05] that you know going beyond the curtain
[1:59:06] of
[1:59:07] time and he says here she's standing
[1:59:10] there she said my boy my boys went on
[1:59:13] home he said I don't want to I don't
[1:59:15] want to stay here I want to go I'm old I
[1:59:18] want to go and he looked at brother Ram
[1:59:21] asked the person standing next to him he
[1:59:23] said do can she hear did she hear the
[1:59:26] message this morning said well she can
[1:59:27] hear all right he said well why don't
[1:59:28] you make sure that she hears that and he
[1:59:30] begins to speak to that sister. He said,
[1:59:32] "Sister," he
[1:59:34] said, "you're griefstricken, aren't
[1:59:37] you?" And he said, "Now, if you can just
[1:59:40] catch a glimpse of this, your son is
[1:59:43] standing on the other side waiting for
[1:59:46] you." That's so good. He said, "It'll
[1:59:49] just it'll just be like a moment, just a
[1:59:51] step." But you know what he did? He
[1:59:53] encouraged her to take a hold and let
[1:59:57] God let God minister to her right
[2:00:00] through this time until that purpose for
[2:00:02] her life was fulfilled. I tell you, God
[2:00:06] cares.
[2:00:08] I know these little points like this may
[2:00:10] not seem like like great big doctrine,
[2:00:12] but these are places we live. This is
[2:00:15] places we live. Amen. Amen. And as a
[2:00:17] pastor, I thank God that he would open
[2:00:19] my eyes to be able to see that because
[2:00:21] it isn't me that I can bring healing,
[2:00:23] but I believe there's healing in the
[2:00:25] house.
[2:00:27] He didn't He didn't give me a whole lot,
[2:00:29] but he gave me two pence.
[2:00:32] He said, "Keep pouring that oil and that
[2:00:34] wine in. Keep pouring it in. It'll bring
[2:00:37] healing to them. Keep pouring it in
[2:00:39] because it's me. It's my word. It's my
[2:00:41] spirit.
[2:00:43] You believe that? Amen. He's all that we
[2:00:46] have need of.
[2:00:49] I'm telling you friends, he cares. He
[2:00:51] cares for you. He cares for me. He cares
[2:00:54] for your spirit. Just as he cares for
[2:00:56] your soul, he cares for your spirit.
[2:01:00] Let's
[2:01:01] pray.
[2:01:08] Father, you're mindful, Lord, of us as
[2:01:11] your children.
[2:01:17] Lord, we trust you this morning, Lord.
[2:01:19] I'm I'm trusting you, Lord, as each time
[2:01:23] to take, Father, just the the
[2:01:26] fragments of those things that Lord
[2:01:29] would be spoken. you would give uncction
[2:01:33] and inspiration
[2:01:35] to Lord God that for hearts
[2:01:40] that spirits
[2:01:43] Lord Lord no doubt Lord
[2:01:46] there's lives that are here
[2:01:49] that Lord where there's a broken
[2:01:52] spirit sometimes Lord that broken
[2:01:57] spirit that
[2:02:00] wondering has hindered
[2:02:02] Something has brought a hindrance, Lord,
[2:02:05] in their pathway. Maybe they were right
[2:02:07] in
[2:02:08] line. You were dealing with them, Lord,
[2:02:11] moving in their lives. And Satan is an
[2:02:15] opportunist. He'll take advantage in
[2:02:17] every
[2:02:19] situation. But
[2:02:21] Lord, you don't change your word. You
[2:02:25] don't lose
[2:02:26] sight. I'm standing right here this
[2:02:29] morning. I don't believe you've lost
[2:02:30] sight of
[2:02:32] one. You're the same God who went and
[2:02:35] found
[2:02:36] Orville. Oh, Brother Brandham came out
[2:02:39] to that house where he described that
[2:02:40] little sheny they lived in. Lord, I was
[2:02:43] right there standing by the edge of the
[2:02:45] driveway to look upon the hill where
[2:02:48] Sister Hattie's house was
[2:02:51] at. It wouldn't have been choice places,
[2:02:54] as a matter of fact, of her home and
[2:02:56] house and
[2:02:57] everything. But God, what what what was
[2:03:00] so precious? I thought as I stood there,
[2:03:04] oh
[2:03:05] God, what you did on that hill, your
[2:03:09] presence coming down. Just like you
[2:03:12] provided for Abraham, that
[2:03:14] ram, you provided for Sister Hadtie's
[2:03:20] boys. And you provided for Orville,
[2:03:22] Lord. when his spirit had seen and
[2:03:25] experienced so much grief, he saw a
[2:03:29] sight, Lord, of his daddy
[2:03:31] that God had took the grace of God for
[2:03:34] his
[2:03:35] life. Lord, there's things that not only
[2:03:38] maybe we've seen or we've experienced. I
[2:03:41] Lord, I can't even imagine the list of
[2:03:43] things throughout just this
[2:03:45] congregation right here.
[2:03:49] But I know Lord, I have absolute
[2:03:52] confidence that God, you are more than
[2:03:57] enough to
[2:03:59] restore the brokenhearted.
[2:04:04] You're more than enough, Lord,
[2:04:06] to move right down there, Lord, and
[2:04:08] catch that heart, that
[2:04:11] life. Lord, just lead it and center it
[2:04:14] right back around
[2:04:17] the word of God. Not that their life
[2:04:19] isn't centered around the word, but it's
[2:04:21] just Lord, it's though they're not
[2:04:23] themselves. Maybe they're staying and
[2:04:24] they're wanting they're they're like
[2:04:25] that we talked about that groaning.
[2:04:27] They're longing to get back to that
[2:04:29] place. I I just want to get back to that
[2:04:32] place. Lord
[2:04:35] Jesus, take our hands,
[2:04:38] Lord. Take that of our life,
[2:04:41] Lord. Lord, our spirit, Lord. No doctor
[2:04:44] can set that spirit like a bone, but you
[2:04:48] can. You can go down, Lord God, and
[2:04:52] bring that right back in line. You did
[2:04:55] it for them on the road to
[2:04:57] Emmas. You did it for the little sister
[2:04:59] that was sitting in the prophet's back
[2:05:01] office there right at the end of
[2:05:04] 1963. You did it, Lord, to this young
[2:05:08] man right there, Lord, in the middle of
[2:05:11] 63 in July.
[2:05:14] right there. Lord God, you ministered to
[2:05:17] these different
[2:05:18] needs. Young people, Lord, like those
[2:05:22] twins that were
[2:05:23] there. What about David? You ministered
[2:05:27] to David? What about Elijah? When Elijah
[2:05:31] was in the the place that he was in, you
[2:05:34] went and you ministered to him,
[2:05:36] [Music]
[2:05:37] Lord. Oh God, I
[2:05:40] pray. Lord Jesus, may your Holy
[2:05:47] Spirit, great physician, Lord, may you
[2:05:50] bring, Lord, just take that bomb, Lord,
[2:05:53] through hearts that are open to say,
[2:05:55] Lord, heal me. Heal me,
[2:05:58] Lord. Heal me, Lord. You know, I I don't
[2:06:01] even know where to begin. I don't even
[2:06:03] know the words maybe to say, but God,
[2:06:05] heal me, Lord. I I want to come back to
[2:06:09] myself, Lord.
[2:06:11] Oh God, granted Lord here this morning.
[2:06:15] Lord, I've stood here as a witness,
[2:06:17] Lord. And there's, Lord, a congregation
[2:06:20] that a witness to. We've not only seen
[2:06:23] you, Lord, heal physical. We've seen
[2:06:26] you, Lord, heal cancer. We've seen you,
[2:06:29] Lord, heal depression, seen you heal
[2:06:31] anxiety. We've seen you, Lord, change
[2:06:34] lives, Lord God, by the coming of the
[2:06:36] Holy Spirit, Lord. hearts being turned
[2:06:39] around and we believe
[2:06:42] Lord you're the same
[2:06:45] God to
[2:06:46] restore broken spirits
[2:06:49] Lord
[2:06:52] wounded oh God grant
[2:06:55] it grant it
[2:06:57] Lord thank you for your mercy I think
[2:07:01] back Lord to the footprints on the sand
[2:07:03] of time and the man he said I see
[2:07:06] sometimes it went from two to one set of
[2:07:10] footprints. What? What happened? What
[2:07:12] was
[2:07:13] that? Oh,
[2:07:16] hallelujah. And your response
[2:07:19] was to that man, that
[2:07:23] believer, the one set of footprints you
[2:07:25] saw is when you didn't have the strength
[2:07:28] to walk, I carried you. Oh,
[2:07:32] God. Hallelujah. You've not abandoned
[2:07:36] your children, Lord. You're not ashamed
[2:07:39] to pick us up and carry us. No, you're
[2:07:41] not
[2:07:42] [Music]
[2:07:45] ashamed. So, Lord, we
[2:07:47] dismiss all feelings of shame and
[2:07:52] guilt for Lord of the ways that maybe
[2:07:55] that a spirit would be broken or how we
[2:07:58] would feel. We dismiss those feelings,
[2:08:01] Lord, of shame and
[2:08:03] guilt. And we, like David, we call out
[2:08:06] to you, Lord. Lead me in the path of
[2:08:09] uprightness. Bring my soul out of
[2:08:11] prison,
[2:08:14] Lord. Oh God, grant
[2:08:17] it. Help us, Lord, I
[2:08:19] pray. May you just minister to our
[2:08:22] hearts, Lord. In Jesus precious name.
[2:08:27] Amen.
[2:08:29] Amen. If you'd like to
[2:08:32] [Music]
[2:08:40] stand in
[2:08:42] me a
[2:08:44] clean
[2:08:48] heart, oh God. Yes, Lord.
[2:08:54] and renew a right
[2:08:57] spirit within me.
[2:09:02] [Music]
[2:09:08] Oh Jesus, almighty
[2:09:12] [Music]
[2:09:20] God and renew a right
[2:09:24] spirit
[2:09:26] within me.
[2:09:28] [Music]
[2:09:34] Pass me not
[2:09:37] away from thy
[2:09:42] presence, oh Lord. Yes, Lord.
[2:09:48] Take up thy holy spirit from me.
[2:09:58] Oh,
[2:10:01] restore unto
[2:10:04] me the joy of thy
[2:10:13] salvation and renew arise
[2:10:17] spirit
[2:10:19] within
[2:10:22] me. How many of you believe forgiveness
[2:10:25] is of God? Amen.
[2:10:28] Brother Ram will talk to us of one of
[2:10:29] the greatest attributes that could be
[2:10:31] displayed. Brother Ram would say in one
[2:10:33] place dealing with forgiveness, he said,
[2:10:34] "Let me show you the power of a
[2:10:36] believer." And he would take us down
[2:10:38] through numbers in
[2:10:40] Exodus. But you know, it's kind of like
[2:10:45] if you've had an injury that come about
[2:10:47] to come about. I don't know if this if
[2:10:49] this happened to brother Brian or not,
[2:10:50] but a while ago he had a cut and he had
[2:10:53] all that taped up. Sometimes when things
[2:10:55] like that happen, you get a physical
[2:10:57] injury or something takes place, a lot
[2:10:59] of times you have to tell them and they
[2:11:01] put you on light duty, right? I don't
[2:11:03] know if that happened to you or not, but
[2:11:05] sometimes you do that, right? You can't
[2:11:07] just assume the regular way that you're
[2:11:10] doing things, but you you're they're
[2:11:12] they're giving you lighter duties until
[2:11:14] all of that comes back to a place, you
[2:11:17] get released by a doctor, and then you
[2:11:19] can go back to functioning the way you
[2:11:21] need to as far as doing whatever you do
[2:11:23] on your job. Let me just tell you
[2:11:26] something.
[2:11:28] This is why I link even when the Holy
[2:11:29] Spirit would tell us last
[2:11:31] week
[2:11:33] sometimes we're trying to forgive
[2:11:36] without being
[2:11:38] healed. And in order for forgiveness to
[2:11:41] work, the channels have got to be
[2:11:43] healed. This is where healing takes
[2:11:46] place within our lives. And sometimes
[2:11:48] we're saying, "Oh, I want to forgive."
[2:11:49] And we do. We do. I want to forgive.
[2:11:51] Don't we all
[2:11:53] forgive to where that we're not holding
[2:11:55] somebody in a in a in in a cage or
[2:11:57] holding them there, holding them in that
[2:11:58] thought of what they did and they did
[2:12:00] this and but you know this is
[2:12:03] where reality comes in where we need to
[2:12:07] then say Lord what I need is healing.
[2:12:10] I need healing. Cuz you could sit all
[2:12:13] day long and say you need to forgive.
[2:12:14] You need to do all that's true but some
[2:12:16] of the times where it all begins with is
[2:12:19] healing. Is that right? Hallelujah. It
[2:12:21] starts with healing. It just starts with
[2:12:23] that. You know what? You don't even have
[2:12:24] to know what to say. All you have to say
[2:12:27] is, "Lord, heal me."
[2:12:30] Let it be, Lord, to that place to where
[2:12:31] I can get back to a full duty as a son
[2:12:33] and daughter of God. Maybe you've been
[2:12:36] on light duty. Maybe they've been
[2:12:37] restricted, but now healing can bring
[2:12:40] you back into that place. Don't you love
[2:12:42] him? Amen. Let's sing this again. Go
[2:12:45] ahead and sing it again, Brother Brian.
[2:12:51] Create in
[2:12:53] me a clean
[2:12:58] heart,
[2:13:00] oh
[2:13:02] God.
[2:13:04] Oh, and renew a right
[2:13:08] spirit
[2:13:10] within me.
[2:13:14] [Music]
[2:13:17] Oh
[2:13:18] create
[2:13:20] me a
[2:13:22] clean. Yes,
[2:13:25] Lord.
[2:13:27] Oh
[2:13:29] God.
[2:13:31] Amen. And renew a right
[2:13:36] spirit
[2:13:37] within me.
[2:13:42] Oh,
[2:13:44] and cast me not away from thy
[2:13:53] presence, oh
[2:13:57] Lord, and
[2:13:59] take not thy holy spirit from
[2:14:09] me, but resto
[2:14:13] Restore
[2:14:15] unto
[2:14:16] me the joy of thy
[2:14:23] [Music]
[2:14:25] salvation and renew a right
[2:14:30] spirit within me. One more time. Cast me
[2:14:35] not away.
[2:14:37] Oh, cast me
[2:14:41] not. Cast me not away from thy
[2:14:47] presence. Oh Lord, there's healing in
[2:14:50] your presence, Lord. Take
[2:14:55] thy Holy
[2:14:57] Spirit from me.
[2:15:03] Oh, but
[2:15:05] [Music]
[2:15:06] restore
[2:15:08] unto
[2:15:10] me. Yes. The
[2:15:12] joy of thy
[2:15:17] [Music]
[2:15:18] salvation and renew a right
[2:15:23] spirit
[2:15:25] within
[2:15:30] me. Hallelujah.
[2:15:33] Hallelujah. Can you play the can play

[2:15:37] transgressions.

[2:15:46] [Music]
[2:15:49] transgressions. He was
[2:15:52] bruised for our iniquities.
[2:15:58] [Music]
[2:16:02] The
[2:16:04] chastisement of our peace was upon
[2:16:12] him. And by his stripes, by his stripes
[2:16:18] we are
[2:16:22] healed. Hallelujah. He was
[2:16:27] wounded for

[2:16:30] [Music]
[2:16:34] transgressions. He was

[2:17:24] iniquity.
