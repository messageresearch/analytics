uplifted me and just go together with our brother I can just take a quick moment give a quick testimony it was a couple weeks ago probably three weeks ago or so I was going through a real kind of a deep trial on Satan kind of beating me up about uh decisions I made back when I was real little and when God was first call in my life and went a different direction and uh and then you know the Lord called me back but Satan was you know trying to say look at how many you know how how long you you was out in the world and such and the decisions you made there and and the things that could have been better and uh brother Brian actually got up uh a few uh Thursday nights ago and was talking about uh how the children of Israel when they went through and why it was dry ground that they they walked on and he said you know it's because of the mud pits in Egypt and boy the Lord really spoke to me through that just that little thing he shared there and how yeah we were on the in the treadmill in Egypt there and going around in circles through the mud and such but God has set our feet on dry ground and not only that we're not not on the treadmill said we're going somewhere so just wanted to share that sometimes just those little things you know the Lord lays it on your heart to say something you just never know who's going to touch because I could just tell you that really touched me and bless me and help me and just change my uh changed my direction and that impression just started to lift right then so let's just go before him in prayer and dear Lord Jesus we just so love you Lord and you're just such a caring father Lord and just always mindful of our needs Lord and what we need and and your timing is always perfect Lord and we just want to say thank you Lord for for watching over us so much Lord and for taking care of us Lord and Lord sometimes Lord we just uh in a way we can look at the the things the trials and the Lord to even the issues and such we go through and and kind of sometimes even give those a little too much credit Lord we're we're Lord uh the prophet taught us Lord that even though our tests and trials and and the different things we go through is just because there's an attribute inside of you that you are wanting to make more manifest to us Lord and so Lord I just pray Lord even even in the prayer request uh tonight Lord for you to

don't depend on you for whatever it takes to draw closer [Music] to you Lord that's what I'd be willing I'm off I'm off on it I apologize for that [Music] thank you oh [Music] then that's what I'd be

you you that's what I'll be willing to do [Music] amen is that how you feel tonight whatever it takes whatever it takes Lord I want to be closer to you I'm sure if we can just have we have that resolve in our hearts no matter the path I'm sure it would probably be some paths that we would not necessarily take you know brother Branham looked in certain things that God had taken him through that at the moment and at the time and for who knows how many months and how many how long he went but when he saw his little baby cross-eyed dying I mean he went to pray and God just was like a black sheep came down brother Brown talks about how that he said when he looked back at that time he said for what God has been able to do because of that where there's not been one cross side child that's ever crossed that platform but what God has not healed him and so In the Flesh and other things you would rather have went the other way but it well I want you to catch this that it brought something out in the prophet's life that only God could do as he yielded to God and what it ended up becoming is it becoming a great blessing to the people of God to where there wasn't one cross-eyed child they could cross there I'm sure there's probably some paths tonight maybe we've come through paths that God will take us through and I say God let me just whatever it takes I want to get closer to you I want to get closer to you no matter what circumstances no matter what comes what arises I want to get closer to you Lord let's just bow our hearts in a word of prayer tonight father how we thank you Lord for your mercy thank you Father for the each and every one Lord of your children Lord as they've come your God to gather together around the word of God we just the Lord asked that you would come Among Us in a special way Lord you know every need and you know the things that are in need to be spoken Lord we just invite you Lord I invite you tonight Lord is each time that you would take this platform Lord that you would speak to our hearts the Lord the things Lord that you've pressed upon my heart that yet Lord I need you to come that you would deliver Lord because you are the one who's given the thought and Lord You're the one to come and minister to our needs tonight may you move Among Us in a special way Lord father I pray that God you'd bless your children be with each and every one Lord we pray for different ones Lord knowing tonight that the Lord their desire would be to be here with us Lord dear God I think of sister Shirley Crest Lord and ask that you would continue to give her strength Lord in her body oh God Lord not only in her body but for an inner Spirit as well Lord sometimes with sickness and things Lord that comes our way God we can become very weary Even in our spirit Lord and we just ask that God that you would just move in a special way and give her strength Lord visit Lord your neighborhood there tonight Lord may you just Lord continue to give strength brother Tommy Lord continue to move Lord for Lord that need Lord and in his life Moment by moment Lord and day by day o God may you continue to strengthen him Lord we pray father and we thank you for your grace Lord and how that Lord that you have brought him through that surgery Lord and we certainly believe that God your grace is sufficient even now Lord father we ask that God you'll continue to give him strength Lord against sister Linda Lord we miss them Lord we miss each one Lord that father when they're not here Lord with us we ask that God that you would guide us now in the remaining part of this service in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen and amen amen God bless you tonight as you turn in your Bibles to Job chapter 23 it might like to say thank you to the musicians and a man even for Benjamin allowed me to Spring that song on you there I know you knew it but um I didn't I knew it pretty well with just singing it to myself but uh I just couldn't get into that but I'm so thankful for God's grace tonight we wanted to go take a little step further here in job 23 tonight and just ask that the Lord would just help us here in this looking at this here and I want to just read here through the first few scriptures of job 23. and job answered and he said even today is my complaint bitter my stroke is heavier than my groaning all that I knew where I might find him that I might come even to his seat I would order my cause before him and fill my mouth with arguments I would know the words which he would answer me and understand what he would say unto me will he plead against me with his great power no but he would put strength in me there the righteous might dispute with him so should I be delivered forever from my judge amen I'd like to just speak tonight just a little thought out of there on receiving strength receiving strength may God bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I wanted just to say when we know you've had prayer and we've been praying for brother Tommy and the Lord was just my father-in-law had just brought him through just so marvelously there in the surgery and certainly it's a journey that's there even before him and before them and but God is is certainly faithful through it all and we just want to say we certainly appreciate the Lord it meant for his hand of mercy and also appreciate each and every one of you your prayers and continued prayer amen as he is going through the recovery I just want to say I uh the staff that was there at Leary Memorial and some a lot of that right there is where my dad had a lot of things taken care of as well too they were just just exceptional just over the top and I just really appreciate that and I pray God will just richly bless them as well for their for their attentiveness and and everything and how that they've been so mindful in the advice and direction that they've given throughout and so I I really appreciate that I appreciate good doctors I appreciate nurses I appreciate all of that and um so we just thank God for his grace and as I look at this here tonight we have been looking there in job 22 and where the Lord had us there and I don't want to say a pause but there were things that God desired to bring out there in job 22 and to really answer the question that yes God does consider the life of his children uh very profitable unto himself because there's a purpose that we're called to serve and God himself is the one who serves that purpose through our lives as we're yielded to him and there's many things like we looked at it that can come our way to always try to hinder the for our lives from being very useful and that of just being an instrument that's available to God and that that means something that it's always where it's available to where it's not occupied because we understand that there's always a battle that's going on and Satan is always very uh strategically trying to absorb our time and trying to absorb Our Lives and he would like to do that in every way that he can and I I believe with all my heart that it's God's desire when brother Brown tells us he says God help the people to recognize that their duty is not to go home work come back home read the newspaper go to bed get back up do the same thing the next day but he said we're put here for a purpose and that purpose is to be instruments of yours that's our top priority that's our top purpose and and that's the part that I we can agree together to say God let everything else I let it all be set aside that we might be instruments that are available to you in other words where it's not something that's tied up you know if you have something a tool or or something and somebody knows you have that tool and they call you up and say Hey Brother Carlos can I borrow this tool Brother Carlos said I would love to loan it to you but so-and-so's using it right now it's a little tied up that's something that in our lives right now that we know that if God's asking we always want to be in that place to say God let my life be in a place that's available to you and I want to stay and we want to stay in that place and you know there's no way for me or you to know all the things that are before us but I we have a confidence that as we stay in tune and in fellowship with God that God Will Make A Way and God will minister to us the very things that we have need of that would further even help us to be more yielded and more sensitive to his leading I think of this scripture out of uh job 23 and you know when we look at this with job job is still in the midst of uh not understanding he doesn't know what's taking place he hasn't heard from God that is something that's very strange to job he doesn't know God's not answered him on what's taken place and he's got all this accusation around him of why things are happening and why they are and yet job is standing in the midst of it all and this this very scripture in job 23 3 6 brother Brandon will even draw from this in the in the church age book and when he's dealing with tests and trials and so forth and he will refer to this last part of the scripture he says what job is saying that through the tests and trials God puts strength in us and I want to just say this that we I can go on record and I believe there's other believers here tonight that can say that in the midst of the tests and trials God gives us strength and with the the greatest strength that we have need of when we realize that for us to even serve God for the really serve him in the right way we've had to receive his strength and that only comes as we've let go of Our Own Strength to receive God's strength and as we go on day by day Moment by moment year by year we're going to need the strength of almighty God and what's important very simple title receiving strength but to receive something is to accept it and that's the very things that we want to be simple enough just to accept it it'd be like this tonight if I was handing out hundred dollar bills I'm sure that you know we would graciously humbly accept those hundred dollar bills if I was if I was handing out to you know paying for men meals and lunches and dinner I'm sure there were you know humility would rise and hey you can take care of my dinner you can take care of all of this and we would graciously what would accept it what would that look like it would simply be take me up on the offer that's being extended and and this is the Simplicity of the Gospel of Jesus Christ God's desire is he has everything and all that we have need of and all that we have to do all God asks us to do is to believe him is to receive what he's trying to give to us not to even not to rationalize it not to reason it not to determine whether we're worthy or not because the truth of the matter is you can never be worthy enough that's why it's called Grace yeah and we have to even be able to receive that now job said he put strength in me and I want to just start with this part of it out of three kinds of Believers brother Branham is praying and I don't have this quote up but I wanted just to listen to it brother random is praying and he says tonight Lord here we are coming again as a needy people for we are ever in need of thee and as long as we're here on Earth we know that'll be the cry for we're in a battle the battle is Raging and you promised and said how the enemy would be like a roaring lion he's loosed among the people we can see it everywhere like a roaring liaring lion devouring what he may because he knows his time is short but we have a father who cares for his little ones and to thee we flee with our request tonight Lord and we pray that you'll grant them in Psalms 28 verse 6 David said blessed be the Lord because he hath heard the voice of my supplications the Lord is my strength and my shield my heart trusted in him and I am helped I want you to notice this my strength is my shield and my heart is trusting in Him and I am helped or supported I mean you know it's good to be supported there's sometimes where there's things that it just that we're not able to actually pass over we must be supported through it he says and I am helped therefore my heart greatly rejoices and my with my song will I praise him the Lord I love this verse the Lord is their strength and he is the saving strength of his anointed so not only do it not only is the new birth strength in our soul where he is the strength of our life he's the source of our strength but we depend on him as our saving strength he is our saving strength so notice as in brother Branham says the uniting time and time he's saying God I we thank you for all these things now give us Thy word for Thy word is truth bless our souls and give us the grace that we need that we might draw from it the promises of God tonight in the word to sustain us through the rest of this week did I read that right give us this what's Grace tonight then we might draw from the promises of God tonight in the word to sustain us through the rest of this week granted I'm just going to tell you I need God's strength day by day we need God's strength Moment by moment and every time as we come not only together tonight we come together in every service and even daily Lord I need your strength and as we look at a service Lord I'm looking to hear from you I'm in need of strength from you Lord Psalms 46 1 God is our refuge and strength a very present help in trouble can we say that together God is our refuge and strength a very present help in trouble he's our refuge he's our place that we run to it's who we look to he is our refuge now if in order for there to be a refuge it speaks there would be trouble and endangerment around but there is a place of safety there is a place that we can run to there is a place that though the storm is happening all around it's just like at times when I've walked out there and here that's raining and raining it's just pouring down boy that porch is awful nice right now it's nice to be able to stand there while the rain is coming down the porch doesn't take away the rain it only gives me a place to stay while the rain is falling and that's what David is saying God is my place to stand while everything else is going around I've got a place to stand he's a refuge and strength of very present Health in the time of trouble in Isaiah 28 5 this scripture speaks I hear of the hour we're standing in of the Holy Ghost Field group of Believers the Bride of Jesus Christ in that day shall the Lord of hosts be for a Crown of Glory and for a diadem of beauty unto the residue of his people and for a spirit of judgment to them that sitteth in judgment and for strength to them that turned the battle to the gate battles were in a battle I read that opening quote we're going to be in battles but it matters where do you turn the battle to turning it to the gate who is the gate who is the door he is the gate he is the entrance he is the door and you know what the gate is the gate is where every transaction has been settled when Boaz was there to redeem Ruth he went to the gate there and before the elders he settled the transaction and he redeemed Ruth because it's in the gate where every transaction for every promise has been settled so here for the people of God in this hour where the Lord of hosts his presence is a Crown of Glory a diadem of beauty and it is a spirit of judgment a discernment among the people of God of discerning not only right from wrong but Discerning when situations arise by having our lives just sharpen and by the word of almighty God that you know this in every situation the battle is to be turned to the gate I tell you we fail the very moment that we look for some other means to satisfy or to settle or to overcome a battle we're already defeated go ahead and get the white flag out but when you can realize the battle is to be turned to the gate is to be turned to the Lord not my reasoning Not My Thoughts not what I think not what I feel but turn it to the gate that's my strength out of the message the token brother Brahm said God is your joy God is your strength knowing the message knowing the truth that's our sufficiency now he's my all sufficiency in him all things I have need of is in him that's our strength my help coming from the Lord you Christians look at this admonition Look to Him for your joy see when unbelief sets in then you have to start looking for other things for your joy I could spin we could go in the Book of Job and spend time on that but you see how Satan's trap is to bring it to everything else let me tell you something without Christ really being first in your life all the rest of the things of this Earth as they grow they fade and everything else you really you can't enjoy them the way that God intends for them to be enjoyed because for real enjoyment it's not worshiping them it's not where you give them precedence or cut out God when it makes what makes room for that no it's God first and all other things will be added is that right this is a simple simple simple remedies you Christians Look to Him for your joy Look to Him for your strength you know David said restore to me the joy of thy salvation right David never lost his salvation but he lost his Joy Israel in Joel 2 lost their Joy right but God makes a way that that Joy can be restored he lets us know where things have been let down and hey The Joy can be restored sometimes it's just through the monotony of the cares of this life right right oh help me now Look to Him for your strength look for him for your happiness he is my peace he is my joy he is my love he is my life that's a covenant the token upon the door Psalms 138 verse 3 in the day when I cried thou answerest me and strengthens me with strength in my soul so he Cried unto the Lord and God heard him and strengthened him with strength in his soul God knows how to get his word his strength to where it needs to be in our life is that right you can look to all other source of of of refuge and all the other measures and it all leave you empty at the end of the day well I'm going to see what so-and-so says about it and I'll I'll see what so-and-so says about it and you know what you have a bunch of opinions come on Friends well so-and-so's been through this so-and-so has been through that but you're a Believer you've got a greater access than so and so and so and so and so and so and so and so the Bible says we're to take all things to God In Prayer hallelujah hallelujah well I ain't heard an answer well no answer don't mean go ahead I don't know this is this is free we've got an access in this hour take it to God in prayer and he'll strengthen us with strength in our soul I'm glad about that Isaiah 41 10. fear thou not for I am with thee be not dismayed for I am that God I will strengthen thee yay I will help thee yay I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness I want you to just to draw upon this remember job says with his great power will he plead against me now I'm going to tell you when job is making the statements that he's making in job 23 what we just read at least just just reading the first few verses there alone job is making statements that he knows where he's standing he's already been through a lot of accusations but job knows he knows where he's standing he knows there's nothing out from under the blood he knows where he's standing with God and that's why job is saying oh then I might hear from him then I might come before his seat job's not in a place of wondering have I done everything have I done all that God has asked me to do job knows I've done all that God has asked me to do I don't know what's taking place I don't know what's going on but he had but he has this confidence if I were to get before his throne he will not use his power to plead against me but he will put strength in me I tell you that's a man that knows his God that's a brother and sister that knows God that if I can just get into God's presence then God will put strength in my life he's not there to consume me he's there to strengthen me and encourage me and direct me in the right ways fear not I'm with thee be not dismayed for I am that God and I will strengthen Thee I will help you I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness I want you to think drawing drawing from this strength God's promise how that he would take care of his children of his children and of his people I wonder the scripture that I'm about to read I wonder if this wasn't one that the Hebrew children relied upon see when they came to a situation God could have completely just tore the whole furnace down God could are you hearing me God could have tore the whole furnace down there could have just been bone no furnace no problem trials before you I'll just tear it all down attested before it would just tear it all down and God could do that let me tell you how powerful God's strength is it was God's strength that brought him out of Egypt it wasn't by the strength of a man's hand it was God's hand that brought him out but even in God's strength they had to obey his word and when they obeyed his word it released the strength of God on their behalf let me tell you something even in the midst of a tester trial I don't want to dwell here tonight but even in the midst of a tester trial it's not a time to start shortcutting or pulling back on God it's in the midst of a tester trial where you need to say Lord I'm going to take up my praise my dedication to another level I don't feel like it you don't serve God by your feelings you serve God by faith and faith is not your feelings and your feelings ain't faith I'm not going to preach that one tonight but the reality that within it is that the main the thing that we want to look at is even the strength that God would release to you and I that would come our way I I let's just read this here on Isaiah 41 43 1 but now thus saith the Lord that created thee o Jacob and he that formed thee o Israel fear not for I have redeemed Thee I have called thee by name Thou Art mine when thou passeth through the waters I will be with thee and through the rivers they shall not overflow me well why not just dry them up why not just rhyme up Lord what I have to walk through them and the fears could come that this is going to overflow me I won't ask the question but probably there's some here tonight they probably could identify me of a time that almost drowned that ain't a fun that ain't a fun memory I don't know how how that it all happened but somebody came and pulled me out of that pool I want you to think about there's been times in our lives we feel the waters it's about to overflow me but God said when they're when they feel like they're getting up to your neck and they're up here I'm still there but God gets you just remove the rivers no I am there to walk through them with you I'm telling you talking about a faithful friend this ain't somebody ditches you when the going gets tough this is one who stick it closer than a brother this is one who's there who's faithful even when we are not faithful he's faithful you don't want to stir something in us to say God that same life I believe inside of me that it produces faithfulness Lord pass through the waters I'll be with thee through the rivers they shall not overflow thee when thou walkest through the fire Thou shalt not be burned why don't just put it out why not just put the fire out can you imagine prayer requests coming in let's pray that the fire's put out let's pray that the fire is put out now you see what happens if our faith is let's pray that nothing comes back on this doctor's report I don't know how many times I've been asked to pray that way and throughout different times listen we pray for healing and I don't care what comes back on a doctor's report God is still greater than every doctor report but if my faith and your faith is well just pray that nothing comes back on the report let's pray and say God you hold my hand if there is something there Lord you are the Lord that healeth all my diseases it may not it don't even have to come back on the report but if it dies you're the Lord that healeth all my diseases you say brother Samuel what do you say I'm saying to have the right expectations because if that's your expectation well this is we're going to pray here and there'll not be nothing on the report what if something shows up on the report because it's not you or I that controls that are you hearing me listen friends that's why anything that's been done any testimony it has not been our faith that's done it it is God's Sovereign faith that has dropped down for that moment explain to me why on the platform that you can have certain cases that were healed and delivered even that little baby went out here it was with that Mass on its on its brain and there were others that were healed of cancer and that one went to an old country doctor that's what the holy spirit said there's an old country doctor out there that can perform that operation it wasn't that that person had less faith do you realize what that was when you read the whole testimony the greatest hospitals in the land Mayo Clinic had wrote that case off and said it can't be done to me I I believe this is greater than just Medical Science when I read across set in half for years I look at that as the God is showing us it don't take great big things it's just simple things that's just his nature there's an old country doctor with the highest of highest doctors said it can't be done but God had won an old country doctor they performed the surgery and the little boy was well sometimes we can't understand those things just like brother Branham you've heard it statue of early man Blasphemous names he talks about a sister in the congregation brother Brian you and I were just fellowshipping about this the other day sister Steffy and brother Brahms tells us on Blasphemous names he calls her out how that God had given a dream and he said if I had not prayed for you you wouldn't have made it through that surgery how couldn't God have just said move like that no surgery he could have I said he could have but sometimes the strength that we that God is wanting to send to us I wonder if we're wanting to receive it or we just get frustrated it didn't happen this way it's not going how I've been praying about it well the thing you've got to be careful of is that you're not putting God in a box but you've got to answer it this way you've got to do it this way because God won't do that he's God and God Alone and this is where when it said when I pass it through the water I don't know it strikes you like it strikes me but I will be with thee through the rivers they'll not overflow you when you walk through the fire you'll not be burned neither shall the flame Kindle upon me now let me just let me just say this footnote here I'm not signing up for a moment to be nearly overflowed I'm not signing up to walk through fire are you understanding me what we're dealing with here tonight is the strength that God gives to us that even in the midst of something strength comes not even in a way of well I don't have to deal with this or I'll just go beyond this many times the strength that God gives us is to go through something can you imagine if every time we prayed it was a miracle dear God we both we've been such a spoiled brat we wouldn't be able to look ourselves in the mirror right yeah and if we Define it he didn't get away not throwing herself on the floor we just throw ourselves out of church she asked porn we become because it ain't it ain't happening the way that I asked for it to happen it needs to happen this way but God in his infinite grace he knows what he's doing he's working on our lives to make something out of us Hallelujah second Corinthians 12 8. here's Paul I mean he knows that Paul had with his eyes they came and went I mean remember that they come and went Paul would even say you know you see how I write to you in big letters I wonder maybe it just happened at convenient times for him that is eyesight you know convenient headache on Monday morning you know convenient not feeling well and as my shift to start up right now it's Lord this this congestion is convenient retinal I I don't think it was convenient matter of fact for what God Called Paul to do Paul wrote many of the letters and testimonies of Liberty and freedom in Jesus Christ while in prison and when he wrote it wasn't convenient where it was let alone to have to write in big letters so when Paul was asking God three times he asked him because it would come and go come and go and he said to Paul I know we're familiar with it my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness then Paul said most gladly therefore will I glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ May rest upon me now that Paul was not saying let me put in modern day language Paul was not saying that I get on Facebook or insta Twitter or you know twittergram or what Instagram and you know what I'm saying I'm just fun in there but you know he departed and say I get on there and say glory to God I've got this sickness again no that's not what he was saying Paul was saying I have learned to worship God even in the midst when this comes you know why because Paul realized God had spoke to him my grace is sufficient I wonder how many times the Dead the devil tried to bother him because the same messenger of Satan that came to Buffet him and his eyes would give out then they would come back in I wonder how many times that the enemy stood right next to him and said you prayed for others what about yourself he don't care for you and look look at your labors look at what's taking place he don't care for you and what he can what how Satan can no doubt stand there but when when Paul had an answer from God Paul said I realize it ain't going to be the last time it comes it might come 50 more times it'll come in however often until I'm taken from this Earth but it is not going to steal my praise I say God help us to come up to this kind of level you can't what kind of level I'm telling you what kind of level to where we're no longer being read like a book in terms of we ought to be a written epistle but we shouldn't be a book that's being read oh Lord have mercy you tell they're down well you can tell they're feeling good well you can tell they're feeling down God help me to be the right kind of a book to be read not to be the that other kind of a book but don't talk to them today oh my what's going on that no we go God help me Lord Jesus to be in that manner to praise you in the midst of every situation now you men don't mean praise breaking her running around that didn't mean that it's all bad that's what it is but there is a Hallelujah there is a thank you Lord in your soul God your grace is sufficient to see me through verse 10 therefore I take pleasure in infirmities and reproaches in Necessities in persecutions in distresses for Christ's sake help me Lord help me Lord I think it's pretty safe to say nobody here sitting here could probably say I'm there already unless that's humility talking there I don't know for when I am weak weak then a part of Paul needed to be weakened and a part of Paul needed to be strengthened now brother Brian I love how he puts it in this manner how that Paul in his prayer to God was asking God to relieve him of that sickness Lord take away this infirmities so I can be stronger no doubt Paul had a good reasoning a good objective Lord take this away there's things that you know burning on my heart letters that are to be wrote to the Church of the Living God hello this is these were things that there could be an argument or an appeal that's to it but God responds to him that Paul in this way that when you're strong then I'm weak I can only be strong when you're weak I'm talking about strong in our life and this is why Paul said I'm thanking God that I got all of it out of me and when I get everything out of me then God can come in but as long as I got some of myself there then God can't come in and you know God gives us Grace because we smother him out now I said we brother Brandon said if I can give William Branham out of the way he's always getting in God's way he said to many times that he thinks that he can do something about something and he gets in the way oh my mama I said God help me Lord help me Lord now this strength Paul receives strength from God but it was in strength in terms of you'll never have any more troubles with your eyes whatsoever but God does that when God there are the Earth and he healed heal lives he touches lives Hey listen friends his healing is lasting is that right it's lasting but then how with this situation that had arose God instructs Paul that within it that my grace is sufficient through this all this was strength to endure to go through it Psalms 37 39 the salvation of the Lord the salvation of the righteousness of the Lord he is their strength in the time of trouble and the Lord shall help them once again support them and deliver them he shall deliver them from the wicked and save them because they trust in him I think about the picture of the footprints on the sands of time the person sees two sets then they look back and they say hey how come sometimes there was only one set of footprints and the Lord replied those are the times when I carried you he is our help our support our strength well I thank God for it when in the time of trouble God could very easily keep trouble from our lives but God uses trouble can I say it how the prophet said it in the message I know he said he puts bits in its mouth and makes it obey him and it only works to draw us closer to God Philippians 4 10 Paul said I rejoice in the Lord greatly that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again worrying you were all so careful but you lacked opportunity not that I speak in respect of want for I have learned in whatsoever State I am therewith to be content I know how to be a beast and I know how to abound everywhere and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry both to abound and to suffer need I can do all things through Christ which strengthen me can we say that together but say it as a real confession no matter what it is that we are going through see Paul was he said I am instructed come on Friends when the Holy Ghost has come in when the Holy Spirit comes into your life God doesn't say well you don't need the Bible no more no the Bible tells us that scripture all scripture is inspired and profitable for instruction into righteousness and correction it's the word that we receive strength from to guide us to direct us to to to to put us in the right course and Paul said I've learned evidently he's been through some experiences let's read it together I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me brother random talks about there was a condition that he battled in his life you know nervous condition and brother Graham talks about it like this in uniting time and sign of how he said that he had battled that and God came to him with that nervous condition and that and that tension that can be around about a life how many know that tension actually is a blessing brother Ram talks about tensions as a blessing because he said to a Christian you're always in your mind am I pleasing to the Lord am I pleasing to the Lord am I pleasing to the lord always within that in our life the program talks about this nervous condition and he talks about how he says he used to bother me so bad it would scare me but he said one day how he came to me and he told me it'll never scare you again now listen to this it'll never scare you again God didn't tell him you'll never get nervous again he said it'll just never scare you again are you with me brother Abraham said now he says I feel it he said I feel that nervousness I know it's there but I just go on because it don't scare me no more and I'm so thankful for that he said he could have told me it won't be no more just as well but he said you won't be scared no more wow what is that brother Samuel that's called receiving strength the prophet could have contested with God and said but Lord what have I done but wait a minute did you hear what he said I'll take the scare out of it the nervousness was still it'll come but it won't scare you no more I'm telling you I believe that's an example for you and I and a real encouragement because there are some things that we have to go through and labor through that we need the strength of almighty God let me tell you friends I believe in miracles he's still a miracle working God we could go through testimony after testimony but let me tell you something every day is not a miracle every moment's not a miracle if I go back and look over the times of even the testimonies that's come in at different times throughout this assembly and how things would be it's not every day it's not every every Thursday or every Sunday where there's a report of a miracle taking place right there's there's some where there's testimonies that come in that God moved on their behalf as far as in terms of they didn't have to go through maybe a certain medical procedure healing then there's others had to go through a medical procedure what is that healing save Holy Spirit Same Spirit of faith come on Friends God gives us strength to go through in this life I want you to think of this I'm coming down Nehemiah chapter 6 and verse 9. I don't have a lot to background in this but you get home tonight or sometime I I love is Ezra and Nehemiah I love that whole whole whole whole chapters and whole books but right here in Nehemiah chapter six Nehemiah is tasked with rebuilding the walls and there's been all kinds of oppositions against it there's been those in the land that have made fun of those walls when they started on them they might only been this High a fox can run through them what was that about what was that really about to see if it could distract them to get him entangled with that argument come on Friends then you had accusations same people to buy San berlet stirred up the same stuff again and they started saying oh there's you know making accusations against Nehemiah Nehemiah wants to be a king and Nehemiah wants to be a ruler and all of these walls but their purpose was was to weaken the people from building the walls the walls was a protection but the walls didn't go up overnight it was Stone by Stone by Stone and I want you to notice this I don't have time to labor on it but it's just for this point in verse 9 they all made us afraid saying talking about the people of the land and those who were coming against the people their hands shall be weakened from the work that it be not done by what when you read this whole chapter it's accusations saying that Nehemiah has wanted to make himself something and Nehemiah never said that at all Nehemiah said what you're saying is lies none of it's true but he realizes it's Satan trying to get at the people and here's what he asked now therefore o God strengthen my hands you see there's sometimes where we've got to turn and the battle is you face that opposition head on and there's other times that the way that we battle through it is is recognizing Satan's objective is to get you out of your post to duty and away from what God intends for you to do come on friends and this is where Nehemiah said Lord strengthen my hands in other words let me tune out all that other nonsense and let me focus on what you have called me to do strengthen my hands Hey listen he's the same God that took down the walls of Jericho it had been nothing for him to put walls up but that ain't the way that God intended to do it they were going to have to heave some Stones move some Stones carry some Stones play some stones God strengthen our hands Nehemiah could have prayed Lord get rid of Tobias tracks and bullet Dead with lightning Lord remove them out of here Lord God send them to another place Lord For Your Glory nope that is how God works so when you find yourself in the middle of a situation that's uncomfortable say God strengthen my hands Paul went on to talk about how that there were many that came against him in second Timothy 4 17. verse 16 he said at first my answer no man stood with me but all men forsook me and I pray God that it may not be late to their charge notwithstanding the Lord stood with me and strengthened me what did he strengthen Paul to do keep running the race when Paul said I have run the course he received strength from God along the way I have kept the faith he receives strength from God along the way the Lord was the strength of his life and the saving strength of his anointed by me the preaching might be fully known that all the Gentiles might hear and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion and the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work and will preserve me unto his Heavenly Kingdom to whom be glory forever and ever amen let me just end with this part of it skip some things have you ever heard the term the Blues the Blues I'm not talking about a saxophone I like saxophones I'm not talking about New Orleans I'm not talking about the music I'm talking about the blues were you get the feeling down or sad now I can give you if you those you have to Table app and things like that just look the word Blues up and when you find that Brother battle you'll find him making statements of when you begin to think about all that God has done all the blessings that are there for you baptism after baptism you are predestinated you cannot fail he said how could a man get the blues thinking about that I'm saying these things purposely in this way he said how could he get the blues thinking about that then brother Brown will talk about the enticing Spirit talking about people getting the blues now if you just read those first few quotes and that's all you had you'd be in a heap of trouble the devil probably want to be whipping you left to right because you'd think Lord have mercy I must be sinning by having the Blues but let's read a little further let's read a little further even as the Revelation as it continues to break but this is what brother Brown's talking about he don't just it's not discrediting what was said before but brother Ram goes into that same thing about one of the greatest hurts through that's hurt me through my life has been a nervous condition and he talks about how that you know he says I used to hear the my daddy and the rest of them talk about getting the blues and you don't know what that is there's certain things I don't know I've experienced the Blues seems like they like to make a regular stop at that old cul-de-sac right I mean they're as faithful as Valpak in the mail all them useless coupons but the Blues Blues 50 years old I've done nothing for the Lord he said some of you Brethren my age he said they used to call it having the blues pop used to talk about it and I wondered what he meant don't have to wonder no more and I sure know how what he meant then you get the feeling that way which is none of it true if there's nothing else in that quote you heard me that right there none of it's true Satan has a way of trying to present things to be the truth and it ain't it's just you you know it you know it it's just you doing that well how is it me doing that because you're entertaining that [Music] entertaining that thought now let's look what the prophet said works as Faith Express I love this brother Rams says against all hope he's quoting out a Romans 4. all hope was gone oh every time I go to feeling a little what's that say blue oh no not brother Branham every time I get to feeling blue oh probably only happened once in his life this is 1965. when brother Brown preaches perfect faith in 1963 it's an evening message and brother Brown comes to the platform and he starts the message perfect faith and he says you think I don't get gloomy times see our imagination is brother Brandon was eating donuts with the angels and he was just walking and he never had any battles let me tell you something friends that was a man who lived closer to God than probably most of us will ever be able to attain to as the messenger of the age that's that's not putting us or locking us out of anything but what I'm saying is is that he still was a man he still had battles and you know what I'm grateful for the Insight that we can look into this and see this I get gloomy sometimes Satan comes and tells me nobody cares about you you ain't got a friend in the world but this is what's important brother Branham didn't get on Facebook and let everybody know this is how I feel today foreign this is what he said he said but then I look back and I see those from Georgia that have stayed over for the evening service and he said I look right back and say what about that devil they didn't have to be here but they want to be here he said I put it right back in his face that's what you need to be doing you need to be putting back those things right in the devil's face I am loved I am appreciated put it right back in his face um every time I go to feeling a little bit blue I read that chat let's read that can we Romans 4 we'll close on this who against hope believed in Hope Mama that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be and being not weak in faith in body he was weak but he wasn't weak in faith he considered how do you know it wasn't weak in faith because he considered not his own body now dead brother Brandon picks it up this way and he says God was speaking to Abraham I have let your body get in this condition to see how you're going to react now how will you react to me who's made the promise that you shall have a seed a child be an heir how will you react to it but notice he consider not in other words this was not Abraham's talking points my Aiken my breaking now this one my Latin you know what all those things right there I know we talk about our hurts we talk about her this and that but I think we can bring it on down you understand what's being said here tonight there's sometimes we can talk about things but listen Abraham himself was not focused he did not make it part of the focus you know how it is you can get around somebody and maybe you go in their house or whatever more and you know what the main theme is you know what the main picture is all conversations lead right to that very thing but let me tell you something Abraham's body got weaker it grew more impossible all the time but his faith didn't get weaker well how is it possible that his body got weaker and his faith didn't get weaker ah he was receiving strength not strength as far as the natural body What If Abraham would have been looking at it that Lord my body I've gotten more of a hunch in my back now than I had last month I've had to walk on this cane more more times out of the month than I did last month but you see he was not looking at that he didn't receive strength in his Natural Body he received strength in his space to persevere through it let's stand and when he was about 100 years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was also able to perform and it was imputed to him for righteousness I say it like this brother Brandon says that's the only way a Believer can get his strength is pull it from the word of God that's his strength it's God's promises to him stand by it and believe it now friends I believe that we can receive strength and comfort of the Lord from one another I believe that I'm a witness of that many scriptures we could place on that job himself said that if people were in grief from the times past he said with my lips I would assuage or remove or push away the grief that you're in with my lips I would I would impart I would speak strength to you job was one who took notice of the body that he was with and he would notice those things and job would go to minister to it but here in the midst of these times like this there is times that went within it all let me friends let me just say it like this we can get to such a place we as humans we are we can become creatures of habit like that it'd be just like if if every single time you went to this certain oh I've got a real need I need to go talk to Sister so-and-so or brother so and so I need to go this well why not talk to God don't want your faith dependent on brother so and so or sister so and so God don't want your faith depending on to where Victory and the walk in your life depends on me I'm here to be of a help to encourage you but listen that encouragement will never you you know me by now that encouragement will never point you to me It'll point you to who you are as a son and daughter of God you've got just as much access as I have there might be something that you're not seeing and not not recognizing and if God don't really reveal it to me none of us would know but you see there you have access to God just like I do and within this there are times we can receive strength from others and there's times our strength is going to come from the Lord alone and why what are we going to do while we're waiting Abraham what are you going to do while you wait brother Graham talks about this while you're resting while you're waiting what are you going to do but see God revealed himself as thou shadow the breasted God one in whom we can draw strength from brother Brian said you know that baby drawing strength don't all of a sudden look around and say wow did I grow an inch he said the baby don't even care about that it's just drawing strength and that strength that it's drawing man it'll satisfy it it'll calm it down it's like when our kids were little and man said they'd cry in the middle of night you know what you got to do take care of it to get him well you're going to get them satisfied you're not going to be able to set him up and say hey let me tell you why you shouldn't be crying right now Daddy's got to go to work in the morning I got a long day tomorrow you're wasting your time right Mama didn't get up and say let me tell you something you know what kind of David I've had you think I feel like getting up at 2 30 in the morning what's needed he just needs some nourishment some strength right and when that when that strength is received it satisfies now I hope you hear me how brother Brandon brought it he says why I'm waiting and while I'm resting I'm gonna draw on God for the promises he said if I'm waiting on God for the Holy Ghost I am going to draw from his promises I am going to just set my sights in his word if I'm looking for healing in my body he said I'm going to draw from his promises I know that's very simple but remember God is your joy God is your strength knowing the message he's our sufficiency it's drawing our strength from him it's looking to him and drawing strength from him not whether I feel any different that don't have nothing to do with it feelings will come are you hearing me when everything God God answers the prayer it comes into full manifestation but until that time brother Brown says until that time he said man shall not live but run alone but by out of the bosom of God shall he nurse his strength every word that comes out of the mouth of God shall he receive his strength as it comes from the mouth of God the word I know some Services sometimes and this is something I had to learn early on even as a pastor that some services every service is different because you know in order to have a crop so seed and there's things that has to be sold and put in place and there's things that has to be ministered and spoken and has to be moved upon in our life for us to even at this time I'll tell you wouldn't it be glorious that every time we come together every need that we have boom every need is met right there Miracle power wouldn't that be awesome I mean I'd like it I'd like it for different things that we're praying about now I would love that that's I would like that but who what part of me would like it there's a part on the inside that I'd love to see God glorified but I think there's a part of it with me that would say I won't have to labor his heart I'll just save for the rest Lord because when something lingers you pray more and you pray more and how do you know that a service like this tonight or the next service friends don't discount any service because every service is receiving from El shadiah it's receiving strength from him through it are you with me God knows what he's doing God knows how to bring the expectations and we look for deliverances and everything else God knows how to set all that in place man can do that if man works it up it fails because when God brings it to that place your faith has been built not only for it to happen but to sustain it but in the middle of that the Bible said he gave glory to God 25 years you think Abraham wasn't discouraged at times Hey listen he wasn't just looking at his body getting discouraged that guy had mistakes that he could have put right in his face on and on misunderstandings brother Brown said he focused out all the misunderstandings listen there was one little misunderstanding I ran around the camp by the name of Ishmael yeah are you with me it was there as a constant reminder I am your misunderstanding I am you submitting to your wife hello he had that he had those reminders but it chose to focus on The God Who made the promise and worship and give glory to God and say thank you Lord for another dose of strength thank you for strength Lord strength that sometimes comes our way that just keeps us looking in the right direction I'll tell you there's times we need that just strength to keep looking in the right direction to the right resource I say God help us help us the Lord let's pray how many here tonight maybe man uplift that hand say Lord I just want to receive strength Lord Hallelujah whatever and whatever Channel whatever way whatever means Lord and how that it comes father you see Lord God our hands Lord you see our hearts Lord dear God we we identify together and identify with a word to know that Lord there are times where you take us through Rivers take us through floods take us through the fire but you're right there with us Lord you strengthen us [Music] there's times Lord where the strength comes that my discompletely Lord removes whatever it is Lord in our life that we're troubled with I thank Lord of how the prophet you like you told like he said with that nervousness and that tension as his own words in uniting time and sign you could just have easily have said there'll be no more nervous no more nervousness that you'll deal with but instead you said it won't scare you no more now Lord I can't determine that for me or for anybody else but Lord what I take from there is Lord Jesus you give us strength if that's Lord like as you told your Prophet just like you told Paul then you don't need me or nobody else to go around and say oh this is what is this is this is what it is with me no but Lord if it is something that's like that where Paul talked about that eye that physical condition that would come or go [Music] then Lord Jesus I believe you'll tell us what I think Lord God many times I've stood Lord with many of my brothers even in my own self Lord have stood and I have prayed with different ones Lord with different problems and issues back troubles and things like that and watch the Lord how that you would come and move for those different needs and those people and then in myself Lord when I would get back to the office or not just here but sometimes Lord and else places brothers would gather around and Lord have prayer over me sometimes those are things Lord that we just can't explain but I know this one thing Lord you give us the strength that we have need of not one time were you instructing us or telling us to be acceptive of anything that's not what Paul was Paul never accepted it Paul never started out a circle of eyes getting a vision coming and going he never started out a talking circle on it or a group thread no but Paul said when this comes along I realize it's not that there's anything that God's trying [Music] something that's wrong with me but I've learned within the midst of this time that I am more dependent upon him for he has spoke to me and said my grace is sufficient my strength is perfect in your weakness Lord may we like Paul be able to stand and say then when I'm weak then I am strong [Music] Granite Lord that inner man that is renewed with strength day by day while this outer man perishes gets weaker like Abraham oh God help us to receive the strength that comes our way forgive us Lord when we've
