[39:08] privilege that God has given to us and
[39:11] it's what's in our hearts amen our
[39:13] hearts we know that there's always
[39:15] something God is going to do something
[39:17] very special because he always keeps his
[39:19] word he said where two or three agree or
[39:23] two or three are assembled together in
[39:25] my name I'll be in their midst and then
[39:27] he placed to us he said for us not to
[39:30] forsake to assemble ourselves together
[39:32] amen place it upon us that we might
[39:34] demonstrate and show our faith that Lord
[39:37] I'm coming to have a meeting with you
[39:39] amen and God is always faithful amen how
[39:42] many witnesses are that God is faithful
[39:45] amen I tell you God is faithful to his
[39:48] word amen we just are just so thankful
[39:51] to be here this morning so glad to have
[39:53] um sister Rebecca and Nathaniel and and
[39:56] Ruthie here with us and
[40:02] um glad to have them came up and to be
[40:06] with us and visit with us and brother
[40:08] Nathan just finished his sixth service
[40:11] in four days so he just finished and
[40:14] he's in Finland you pray for him as
[40:17] he'll be he'll be traveling back home
[40:19] and so we just so appreciate having them
[40:22] amen here with us and um we're so glad
[40:25] to have brother George here with us as
[40:27] well
[40:31] amen and uh you know we were we were
[40:33] talking there just a little bit I made a
[40:36] comment to brother George in the back
[40:37] office I said you know I said there's
[40:40] not too many I I don't I don't know how
[40:44] many of living witnesses as far as that
[40:48] was right there with the prophet how
[40:51] many that are still remaining I know
[40:53] they're few and then he asked me he said
[40:55] do you can you name them I said no I
[40:58] don't know all of them that would still
[40:59] be remaining but there's not that many
[41:02] but you know one thing about it this is
[41:04] a privilege um that for brother George
[41:07] I've appreciate brother George his
[41:09] balance Amen on the word of God and um
[41:13] and with it all I appreciate God God
[41:15] gives us um these examples in this way
[41:19] and there's just certain little insights
[41:21] to me um even over the years not only
[41:24] from Brother George's testimony but um
[41:27] my when uh our path crossed with the
[41:30] Bryants and and we just become real good
[41:33] friends and then down there my the
[41:35] testimonies that was shared and things
[41:37] that uh different ones would share with
[41:40] you I so appreciate those testimonies uh
[41:43] I appreciate it just like I appreciate
[41:45] being able to go to different places and
[41:47] actually see the things I no longer have
[41:49] to imagine and what brother Bram was
[41:51] talking about with the bubbling brook I
[41:53] drank from that Brook and so all of
[41:55] those places and and it's just it it's
[41:58] wonderful but you know let me just say
[42:00] it like this we could have all of these
[42:03] things we could have even rubbed
[42:05] shoulders with brother brandham but if
[42:08] we missed what the message was all about
[42:12] and it was about a real
[42:14] relationship with Jesus
[42:17] Christ then we missed it all that was
[42:20] the purpose and you know God God used
[42:23] the vessel it was the prophet it was
[42:25] ordained in this hour God God kept his
[42:28] word it had to be a prophet the word
[42:30] comes to the prophet to restore it and
[42:33] then through that through the life and
[42:36] Ministry of brother brandham God showed
[42:39] himself he was a character that was on
[42:42] display that's not elevating a man
[42:45] that's just remembering God showed
[42:47] himself he made himself known and now
[42:50] that same God is veiled in the bride
[42:54] body of Jesus Christ it's God living in
[42:58] his people amen sister Doris God bless
[43:00] you man so good to see you
[43:04] amen I tell you amen that's a real
[43:07] answer to prayer amen so we're so
[43:10] thankful to have our sister here with us
[43:12] amen you continue to remember her in
[43:14] prayer and I know I know different ones
[43:16] that are here uh this morning and from
[43:20] the week and previous weeks there's been
[43:22] battling with sickness and I know some
[43:24] that that aren't here today that are and
[43:27] um but I'm thankful to know that God is
[43:29] faithful Amen to heal us amen by his
[43:32] stripes we're healed so we don't want to
[43:34] take any further time we want to just
[43:37] invite brother George and um just that
[43:40] brother George just have his Liberty
[43:41] here this morning
[43:43] amen let's just sing a song um let's

[45:41] of Zion Lord for the music we thank you
[45:44] for all your blessings you've been so
[45:47] good to
[45:48] us individually corporately you've been
[45:51] so good to us thank you thank you now
[45:54] for your word thank you for the the
[45:57] things that you've given me to say here
[45:58] we pray that you it would be a blessing
[46:00] to somebody that somebody could gather
[46:03] strength for the journey help us in
[46:05] Jesus name
[46:08] amen thank you very
[46:11] much so we're back in Ohio again this
[46:15] morning am it's good to be
[46:17] here and you all need to be very
[46:21] thankful for the pastor that God's given
[46:24] you yeah don't take him for granted
[46:28] there's only a few people on the planet
[46:30] that um we could say are
[46:34] balanced some are going one way or
[46:36] another way you know some don't have
[46:39] anything to say but God has been good to
[46:42] you and the other thing I like about him
[46:45] is that he's not afraid
[46:47] to Branch out and have some of the other
[46:51] four ministers to come in to
[46:53] speak I've been a lot of places I know
[46:56] you got your story
[46:57] but we got people that I'm the only one
[47:00] that can say it
[47:01] right yeah that's not it's not scripture
[47:06] sorry so I'm here for three reasons
[47:09] that'll be all the music I'm not going
[47:11] to
[47:13] sing we've got singers why would I want
[47:16] to try
[47:18] that um like I say three reasons one of
[47:21] them is a brother Browning you know he
[47:24] every time I see him when you coming by
[47:26] when you coming by
[47:27] well see when somebody invites me that's
[47:29] already 51% of the formula
[47:33] already because we believe they know
[47:35] what they're talking about so the other
[47:39] reason is I felt inspired to come now I
[47:41] could be someplace else but you know
[47:43] there's only 52 Sundays in the year and
[47:46] it's not always good weather in
[47:49] Ohio but um third reason now I don't
[47:54] know about you but um I don't dream a
[47:57] lot when I do dream by the time the
[47:59] coffee's hot well dream's gone but God
[48:02] does deal in dreams
[48:04] and I've got a couple of friends that
[48:07] they dream and then they tell me and
[48:08] that encourages me so this one brother
[48:12] um he called me one one day and he said
[48:14] man I just woke up and I had this this
[48:16] dream and I said well tell me about it
[48:19] so the dream is that he was in uh
[48:23] brother brandom's living room there in
[48:25] Jeffersonville and uh like a fly on the
[48:27] wall and he's seeing what's going on and
[48:31] so in this um in this
[48:34] scene uh he said that he said you and
[48:36] Rebecca were sitting by the
[48:38] fireplace and over here in the chairs
[48:40] was uh brother Neville and sister
[48:42] brandham and they were talking okay they
[48:45] talked for a while they were talking
[48:46] about current things not back then but
[48:49] now and so then brother Nimble got up to
[48:53] leave and he's going toward the door
[48:56] okay he let in March of
[48:58] 74 and then sister randam got up to see
[49:01] him out uh she was called Home in May of
[49:06] 81 so they're by the door and um and
[49:10] then they looked over to Rebecca hey
[49:11] come here so now the three of them are
[49:13] over there well she left in November 0 6
[49:17] it's another dimension I'm still sitting
[49:20] by the
[49:21] fireplace and they looked back at me and
[49:24] they said you keep doing what you're
[49:25] doing
[49:27] so I'm going to keep
[49:29] going and uh there's no lack of places
[49:32] to go last Sunday I was in the southern
[49:37] jungles of Mexico as far as you can see
[49:39] is green probably a lot of snakes out
[49:42] there you know who knows what all is out
[49:44] there but um we had some meetings had a
[49:47] wedding last Sunday and then got home
[49:50] Monday night so we just keep going and
[49:54] there's other places to go but uh I'm
[49:57] not an Entertainer I'm just trying to be
[49:58] a faithful witness because like brother
[50:01] Browning pointed out there's only a few
[50:03] of us left and uh I'll be honest with
[50:06] you some of them aren't believable maybe
[50:08] they got too old I don't know but um
[50:11] we're trying to stay balanced and that's
[50:13] why I do carry a level with me to check
[50:17] on the pulpit
[50:19] first okay you pass the
[50:23] test but um you'd be surprised
[50:27] there's people out there quoting William
[50:29] Brandon and they're about like
[50:31] this oh yeah all these churches you came
[50:35] by to get here today they got big
[50:38] churches big programs got coffee got
[50:41] everything right same Bible but they're
[50:43] not
[50:44] balanced but they're part of the puzzle
[50:46] they're doing their
[50:48] part and so we want to look at the
[50:50] scriptures just briefly Acts chapter 1
[50:53] and you don't have to turn to it but
[50:55] just listen closely Acts chapter 1 1: 6
[50:57] when they were therefore gathered
[50:58] together so the people were gathered
[51:00] from uh the area with the resurrected
[51:04] Jesus and they had a political question
[51:08] who's going to be president are you
[51:09] going to do this wait a minute this is
[51:12] resurrected being you never seen one
[51:13] before and they asked him uh Lord will
[51:17] you at this time restore the kingdom to
[51:20] Israel and he said it's not for you guys
[51:22] to know the times or the
[51:24] seasons which the father has put in his
[51:27] own
[51:28] power but you shall receive power after
[51:32] that the Holy Ghost has come upon you
[51:33] and you shall be Witnesses unto me both
[51:35] right here in Jerusalem over in Judea
[51:38] over in Samaria and to the uttermost
[51:40] part of the Earth all the way to
[51:43] Ohio it didn't come in a parachute
[51:46] people somebody had to come on a horse
[51:48] on a boat brought the gospel you you
[51:52] see so that's where we're going to start
[51:55] and it doesn't say anything about a
[51:57] judge nobody
[51:59] qualifies doesn't matter what your name
[52:01] is who your grandpa was nobody nobody's
[52:03] a
[52:05] judge you know and and nobody's a lawyer
[52:09] we're simply Witnesses so
[52:13] um I'm the eagle that was born in the
[52:16] Baptist chicken yard some of you were
[52:18] born in the Catholic yard and all kinds
[52:20] of things but God gathered us and here
[52:22] we are
[52:23] today God is faithful
[52:26] and so when we get to the other side and
[52:29] there's no clocks then I'll sit down and
[52:31] listen to your
[52:33] stories but today's my
[52:36] turn and so we must keep a balance in
[52:40] our Christian walk very very important
[52:43] especially here at the end time and
[52:46] you're going to hear things today that
[52:47] you haven't heard before but they'll all
[52:49] be true Lord willing um in our world
[52:54] today there's over 7,000 known
[52:58] languages not everybody speaks English
[53:01] and
[53:02] so many of these languages are only
[53:05] spoken they're not even written yet it's
[53:07] just a spoken language amongst a group
[53:09] of people and so we've got the Bible now
[53:12] translated into 700 of these languages
[53:15] and the New Testament is in 1500 of the
[53:18] languages is it sound okay back
[53:22] there okay um people have
[53:27] died literally burned out front to have
[53:31] the English Bible right yeah now this
[53:34] this Bible is the most important book
[53:36] you will ever own there's nothing like
[53:39] it in the world that's right nobody
[53:41] could sit down and write a new book Pope
[53:43] says he need we need a new book he
[53:44] doesn't know what he's talking about no
[53:47] we have God in printed
[53:49] form that's right because people have
[53:54] they've given their life they they've
[53:55] died for it yeah you see this book was
[53:59] written over a period of 1500
[54:02] years by 40 different writers inspired
[54:06] by one
[54:07] author many of them didn't know each
[54:09] other didn't speak the same
[54:11] language and yet here it is all pointing
[54:14] to Jesus Christ
[54:17] Hallelujah a long time ago in
[54:20] 1944 my parents met in Bible School in
[54:24] California and they were married and and
[54:26] they agreed that they needed to go to
[54:28] Mexico to find this tribe of people that
[54:32] only had a spoken language they wanted
[54:35] to go down there and get started on
[54:37] making a dictionary and then the Gospel
[54:41] of John but that kind of work takes
[54:44] about 20 years or more back then today
[54:47] where computers might take a little less
[54:50] but I know that he didn't have that kind
[54:52] of patience and so he started that work
[54:56] and it it's not a matter of let's just
[54:58] fly in there they had no GPS they had
[55:01] nothing it back in the Dark Ages and so
[55:05] they were newly wedged didn't know any
[55:06] Spanish gotten their their military
[55:09] truck that they had purchased to go as
[55:11] far as the truck would go and uh they
[55:14] kind of knew where they had to
[55:16] go so then they hired these horses and
[55:20] they go on Horseback for four days into
[55:23] this
[55:24] area and and you know they camped out at
[55:27] night sounds really fun doesn't it well
[55:30] camping out to me is holiday and
[55:33] express clean sheets and hot
[55:37] water but anyway they go up there and
[55:40] they start finding these people and um
[55:43] and then what's going to happen in a
[55:45] newlyweds home well sooner or later
[55:47] there's a baby going to be born so they
[55:49] come out on the horses instead of going
[55:51] to Grandma's house in Arizona they got
[55:54] on the train and went to Mexico City
[55:55] where the headquarters was with the
[55:58] wickliff Bible
[55:59] translators and that's where their first
[56:01] child was born in late August of
[56:03] 1945 it was
[56:06] me so now you
[56:08] know and uh eventually I was the first
[56:11] of 10 children five boys and five
[56:14] girls okay so he he saw that this was
[56:17] going to be a very difficult task no
[56:20] computers paper and
[56:22] pencil and these people are saying
[56:24] something and you got to you got to make
[56:26] that word on paper
[56:28] somehow it sounds impossible it's still
[56:30] going on in many places well anyway he
[56:33] left out for somebody else and he went
[56:35] to the East Coast of
[56:37] Mexico uh near the gulf to uh start a
[56:41] Baptist work over there and he he
[56:45] founded a bible school where train
[56:47] ministers train Sunday school people
[56:49] it's still there today I've met people
[56:51] that have graduated from it it's been a
[56:52] real success and so that's where that I
[56:55] was put in into the elementary
[56:58] school and I had all the first sixth
[57:01] grades all
[57:03] Spanish I didn't learn about American
[57:05] history I learned about Mexican history
[57:07] you know so forth at home my mother was
[57:09] teaching us you know reading and things
[57:11] we needed to
[57:12] survive and um she had some very strict
[57:15] rules you can imagine growing family and
[57:18] so the one of the rules was that in the
[57:21] house you can speak English but outside
[57:22] you can speak Spanish you go mix them up
[57:26] that come in real Handy later uh that's
[57:29] why today when I meet some of you people
[57:31] that you know kind of mix it
[57:33] up it doesn't fly speak Spanish or speak
[57:38] English I know who you
[57:41] are so here I am in the in the first
[57:45] grade uh first American kid they'd ever
[57:48] seen and so back then we didn't have
[57:50] pencil sharpeners no everybody carried a
[57:54] single-edged razor blade to sharpen your
[57:57] pencil not to hurt each other and um so
[58:01] friend that you know kid I knew he got a
[58:04] very sharp point on his pencil and when
[58:07] I wasn't paying attention he jabbed me
[58:08] in the
[58:09] arm and so when he saw that I had red
[58:12] blood like him then we could be friends
[58:14] so there was my first battle scar well
[58:17] anyway uh we're we only have one service
[58:20] today everybody had a good breakfast
[58:22] right
[58:28] yeah so there's no hurry um Anyway by
[58:31] the time I was nine years old I
[58:33] missionaries kid front row every service
[58:36] no you know back then they didn't give
[58:37] kids
[58:39] choices no this is what we're doing you
[58:43] don't have any to say when you get 18
[58:44] buy your own tickets you can make your
[58:45] own decision but anyway so here I am on
[58:48] the front row every service and by 9
[58:50] years old I realized this gospel that
[58:52] I'm hearing every service isn't just for
[58:54] all these people it's for me too you
[58:56] know because you know the scripture says
[58:58] that all have
[59:00] sinned yeah all the brownings all the
[59:03] Smiths all the randoms all of them they
[59:05] all sin come short of the glory of God
[59:09] your name's not going to get you
[59:10] anywhere and so at 9 years old I I met
[59:14] the Lord Jesus was uh saved because you
[59:18] know the scripture says whosoever shall
[59:19] call upon the name of the Lord wherever
[59:21] you are what color you are doesn't
[59:23] matter and um then on Easter Sunday 1955
[59:27] I was baptized in the Baptist Church and
[59:30] by the time I got out of the sixth grade
[59:34] my parents decided Well you have six
[59:36] grades in Spanish now these next six
[59:38] you're going to have in English I didn't
[59:40] get a
[59:41] vote so here I am 13 years old in
[59:44] Houston Texas with a family I never met
[59:46] before and that was my new life and um
[59:51] survive but um the um we had some other
[59:55] moves and by by the time 1962 comes
[59:58] along uh I was already a teenager and
[1:00:01] had another glorious experience with the
[1:00:03] Lord and they moved me up to live with
[1:00:05] my grandfather in Tucson Arizona because
[1:00:08] my mother was born and raised and died
[1:00:10] in Tucson
[1:00:11] Arizona so here I am in the uh 10th
[1:00:16] grade in Arizona and um I in this big
[1:00:21] school of 2 200 kids and so then when we
[1:00:25] get into the 11th grade uh I had I was a
[1:00:28] guy with a
[1:00:29] reputation no dances no drinking no
[1:00:32] smoking and my friends in the lunchroom
[1:00:34] was was uh the uh Mormon kids I andan
[1:00:38] they at least dressed right and speak a
[1:00:40] little bit of word with them you know
[1:00:42] and so anyway here I am in in high
[1:00:43] school and and uh so I remember one day
[1:00:46] this girl comes up to me and she says
[1:00:48] you know we know you're so picky but I
[1:00:51] know just a girl for you oh really well
[1:00:54] it turns out that that she had some new
[1:00:56] neighbors that had moved from Indiana
[1:00:58] and so she said yeah she's uh she's over
[1:01:01] there getting on the bus well the next
[1:01:02] day I met Rebecca brandom well now I'd
[1:01:05] never heard this name before completely
[1:01:08] new to me uh we didn't travel in those
[1:01:12] circles but sure enough most beautiful
[1:01:14] girl I'd ever seen and then she came
[1:01:16] from Southern Indiana and she had that
[1:01:18] that that accent well out there they
[1:01:21] don't talk like that so I was smitten
[1:01:24] right from the first day you know
[1:01:26] and there's no hope
[1:01:31] and and um so I met her you know the
[1:01:35] next day and um and so she said now you
[1:01:37] got to meet my dad my dad's preacher no
[1:01:40] problem I've seen a lot of
[1:01:42] preachers well see the miracle is God
[1:01:44] moved these people from Indiana 1 18800
[1:01:47] miles and puts them a block and a half
[1:01:49] from my house I didn't have to travel
[1:01:51] many hours like some people I know now
[1:01:53] she was right there God has a way of
[1:01:56] doing
[1:01:57] things and so I'm very very thankful but
[1:02:00] anyway so I go to meet the man after
[1:02:02] school that next
[1:02:04] day and he's in the backyard no shirt on
[1:02:07] it's hot you know and I don't know what
[1:02:09] day it was so don't ask but could have
[1:02:11] been February or March somewhere in
[1:02:13] there uh probably
[1:02:15] February and so we're talking I come
[1:02:20] with a purpose I wanted to date his
[1:02:22] daughter and he's checking me out and
[1:02:26] you know we we're just two guys talking
[1:02:28] maybe 15 20 minutes well by the time
[1:02:32] we're finished I had the victory because
[1:02:34] I got permission but he had the problem
[1:02:37] because he had to tell the rest of the
[1:02:38] world this one's got a
[1:02:40] boyfriend back away they knew who he was
[1:02:44] and they were scared to go ask I didn't
[1:02:46] know who he
[1:02:51] was yeah and so
[1:02:54] um so anyway what I realized you know
[1:02:58] not too long later when I got to realize
[1:03:00] what it was all about he was scanning
[1:03:02] the hard drive that whole time yeah all
[1:03:05] the way out maybe till today and so you
[1:03:09] know I got the permission well at the
[1:03:12] time I was driving a um 5-year-old Ford
[1:03:17] pickup two door no air no stereos pick
[1:03:20] up three speeed and I found out that her
[1:03:23] she had an older brother I thought maybe
[1:03:25] we might have a problem here but her
[1:03:27] older brother was a little skinny guy
[1:03:28] like me and it didn't matter he had a
[1:03:31] nice red brand new red Chevy but the man
[1:03:34] himself drove a Ford station wagon so we
[1:03:36] got along just
[1:03:37] fine now when they moved to Arizona um
[1:03:41] it wasn't because of the weather it was
[1:03:43] because of a vision and they didn't know
[1:03:45] how long they were going to stay so they
[1:03:47] just brought their clothes and got an
[1:03:50] apartment and um at that point Rebecca
[1:03:53] had already had either nine or 10 years
[1:03:55] of classical piano training piano
[1:03:58] teacher was across the street and uh
[1:04:01] know same church same school same
[1:04:03] friends but uh now they moved to Arizona
[1:04:06] and there's no piano well a girl in 11th
[1:04:10] grade with no piano that she's been
[1:04:11] playing every day it could be a problem
[1:04:14] but she realized that the girl at the
[1:04:15] corner her mother was a piano teacher
[1:04:17] and she had grand piano so that's uh
[1:04:20] where she was spending some of her time
[1:04:22] and that's the girl that introduced us
[1:04:24] okay so you can hear some of this on
[1:04:27] tape some of it's filler that you
[1:04:28] haven't heard before but um so brother
[1:04:32] bram's getting the family together one
[1:04:33] evening to go to go to supper and he's
[1:04:36] only got three children he looks in the
[1:04:38] back and there's only two where's
[1:04:40] Rebecca well she's at the corner we'll
[1:04:42] pick her up on the way so he goes to the
[1:04:44] corner stops and he's going up to the
[1:04:46] door and he can hear the piano playing
[1:04:49] well yeah there's 20 fingers you know on
[1:04:51] this piano and it's not Bay Tolen it's
[1:04:54] not shopan it's not down at the cross
[1:04:57] either it's rock and roll you know yeah
[1:05:01] and so well Hearts break girl and so he
[1:05:05] bangs on the door and they heard him she
[1:05:08] comes to the door now he was a balanced
[1:05:10] man he didn't jerk his belt off what are
[1:05:12] you doing down here I'm beat the tar out
[1:05:14] of you no all he said it's time to
[1:05:18] go okay we go she didn't hear another
[1:05:22] word about it for two months but when he
[1:05:24] tells the story
[1:05:26] in August of
[1:05:27] 64 you know some of these details he
[1:05:30] said and just after that she met George
[1:05:32] and he's a Christian end of the
[1:05:34] problem yeah I was taking to the Baptist
[1:05:37] church every Sunday and he was thankful
[1:05:39] and he went with us sometimes so when
[1:05:42] you're on vacation I don't I don't want
[1:05:44] to hear those corny comments well
[1:05:46] there's no church I guess we'll have to
[1:05:48] stay at the beach no you can go in the
[1:05:50] Catholic church and get a slice of
[1:05:52] bread yeah you can go to church
[1:05:57] so God Is
[1:05:59] Watching
[1:06:00] yeah okay so early June of 63 is when I
[1:06:05] was in the first meeting now he didn't
[1:06:07] give me a big list you got to go home
[1:06:08] and listen to all these tapes you got to
[1:06:09] read these books no he he welcomed me he
[1:06:12] he could see
[1:06:14] through you know the veneer he he knew
[1:06:17] what was on the inside I was just a 17y
[1:06:19] old
[1:06:21] kid and so the first meeting was in
[1:06:23] early June of 63 and I'm seeing him in
[1:06:27] pulpit and he's saying things that are
[1:06:29] right out of the Bible can't can't fault
[1:06:32] him on what he's saying and here's God
[1:06:34] in action and so I remember going home
[1:06:36] that night and said Lord this is either
[1:06:38] something comes straight from you or
[1:06:40] it's your greatest deception ever hit
[1:06:41] the earth you know that was my first
[1:06:43] impression but God began to reveal you
[1:06:46] know this is the truth and uh brother
[1:06:48] Bram traveled a lot but when he was home
[1:06:50] he was very you know very gracious and
[1:06:53] we could sit down and talk about the
[1:06:54] scriptures and and different things and
[1:06:58] he was he was just like a father you it
[1:06:59] was very very kind we'd spent time
[1:07:02] together and so I was always welcome at
[1:07:05] their house so people asked me well what
[1:07:07] attracted you to this ministry well it
[1:07:08] wasn't sitting in the you know in the
[1:07:10] pews watching the preacher um the girl
[1:07:13] was the hook on you know the bait on the
[1:07:15] hook but uh but I always kept you know
[1:07:19] two separate things relationship with
[1:07:20] her and relationship with her dad and um
[1:07:23] the fact is when I I met William brandom
[1:07:26] i' already read my Bible through twice
[1:07:29] and if you haven't read your Bible
[1:07:30] through shame on you you got your your
[1:07:33] th telephone and in there there's a
[1:07:36] schedule that you can keep and you can
[1:07:38] read a little bit every day and by this
[1:07:40] time next year you read your whole
[1:07:42] Bible this man came by promise of God to
[1:07:46] turn your hearts back to the original
[1:07:49] amen not to burn
[1:07:51] candles no that's Catholic idolatry came
[1:07:55] to bring us back to the word and that's
[1:07:58] where the life
[1:07:59] is okay
[1:08:02] so when you read your Bible well there's
[1:08:04] a spirit of the scriptures and I can see
[1:08:07] that same spirit in him this the this
[1:08:10] matches I'd heard a lot of Baptist
[1:08:12] preachers and others but okay they're
[1:08:14] great in the Pulpit but go outside and
[1:08:16] it's a different story but here's a man
[1:08:18] that was living the word all the time so
[1:08:20] that's what attracted me to this and
[1:08:23] knowing that it was the same Spirit of
[1:08:24] the scriptures you know
[1:08:26] and even my mother me when I was growing
[1:08:29] up she taught us to read our Bible and
[1:08:32] pray okay then I run into William
[1:08:34] brandom how how how do I get closer to
[1:08:36] God read your Bible and pray oh yeah
[1:08:39] that's the only way you're going to get
[1:08:41] there okay so I'll give you a little
[1:08:43] glimpse into what I call the prophetic
[1:08:45] Dimension and that is that prophets
[1:08:48] speak from eternity that's why brother
[1:08:51] random could be here and he would see
[1:08:52] 500 people when there's really only 131
[1:08:56] probably or
[1:08:57] less okay I didn't
[1:08:59] count but um it's like when when Elisha
[1:09:03] and his helper were in the house and he
[1:09:06] said now son go outside and see what's
[1:09:07] going on so he goes out there and all he
[1:09:09] can see was Soldiers with
[1:09:11] Spears oh he comes back trembling look
[1:09:13] what are we going to do all this problem
[1:09:16] now Elisha didn't take a stick and hit
[1:09:18] him he's put his hand on Lord open the
[1:09:20] young man's eyes so goes back out there
[1:09:23] oh Hills are full of angels huh where
[1:09:26] they come from they were there all the
[1:09:27] time it's another dimension you see it's
[1:09:30] just like brother Ram tries to explain
[1:09:32] it with uh with TV it's coming through
[1:09:34] here all the time there's 500 channels
[1:09:35] going through here and if you got a a
[1:09:37] machine you bring them down well it's
[1:09:40] another
[1:09:41] dimension so brother brandham was
[1:09:43] preaching in Houston Texas in 1950 in
[1:09:49] January and it was a u series of 10
[1:09:53] services and so
[1:09:57] during this time there was a Baptist
[1:09:59] preacher that thought it was his call
[1:10:01] from God to denounce this it's all the
[1:10:03] devil it's no good because then and I
[1:10:07] don't know today but the Baptist
[1:10:09] theology was that healing was not in the
[1:10:13] atonement well how they doing this well
[1:10:16] must be the devil well anyway that was
[1:10:18] his that was his theory and so brother
[1:10:21] Bosworth was working with brother
[1:10:23] brandham he stand I look brother br
[1:10:25] we've got to do something this guy's
[1:10:26] causing a lot of trouble it's in the
[1:10:28] newspapers people are looking at us like
[1:10:30] we need to
[1:10:32] respond and so brother brandom said
[1:10:34] we're not going to waste one night on
[1:10:37] this one man when there's hundreds we
[1:10:39] got to pray for them we got a job to do
[1:10:41] you know so finally brother bradsworth
[1:10:44] convinced him they could do it very
[1:10:46] simply but it has to be done okay have
[1:10:49] at it I'm going to stay in the hotel you
[1:10:51] guys take care of it but holy ghost says
[1:10:54] no you will you know be there you got to
[1:10:57] go so he comes to service that
[1:10:59] night uh his brother random and his wife
[1:11:03] and his brother who was helping him and
[1:11:06] four-year-old
[1:11:07] Rebecca well this was a big night for
[1:11:10] her because for the first time she gets
[1:11:12] to sit with her dad in church all the
[1:11:14] other time he's up here and she sees the
[1:11:17] other little girls with her dad never
[1:11:19] happened to her well they're way up in
[1:11:21] the balcony where they can
[1:11:23] see and um found thousands of
[1:11:26] people and so um brother bonworth is
[1:11:29] down here you know managing this debate
[1:11:33] he said now now the noble esteemed
[1:11:35] brother um the seven compound names
[1:11:39] Redemptive names of Jehovah in the Old
[1:11:41] Testament can we apply those to Jesus
[1:11:43] Christ yes or no we can finish this well
[1:11:47] the Baptist was caught because if he
[1:11:49] says no Then it eliminates salvation If
[1:11:53] he if he says yes it incorporates heing
[1:11:56] oh hadn't thought of that so anyway you
[1:11:59] can hear all about that on tape and um
[1:12:02] the uh struggles they had but anyway it
[1:12:03] comes to an end now during this time
[1:12:07] there was a photographer two
[1:12:08] photographers over here from a famous
[1:12:10] Studio that the Baptist had hired
[1:12:12] because he wanted pictures because he
[1:12:14] was going to win and you know needed
[1:12:16] publication so they're taking pictures
[1:12:18] so um it comes to an
[1:12:21] end and brother Bosworth says now
[1:12:24] thousands people here I can't see but if
[1:12:27] brother brandom's in the audience
[1:12:29] somewhere he's welcome to come down and
[1:12:31] dismiss the
[1:12:32] audience so brother RM starts to get up
[1:12:35] out of his chair and his brother says
[1:12:37] don't you dare cause a riot and the wife
[1:12:41] says it's okay he knows what he's doing
[1:12:43] so he gets up puts Rebecca in his seat
[1:12:45] and she can see him coming
[1:12:47] down and
[1:12:49] so he says as I came down through that
[1:12:52] crowd thousands of sick people he said
[1:12:55] cases that would make the heart of an
[1:12:57] Iron Man melt you know and um he said so
[1:13:02] 500 ushers helped me to get to the
[1:13:03] pulpit okay because everybody won't
[1:13:05] touch him and so he comes down to the
[1:13:08] pulpit and he says a few words he says I
[1:13:10] don't need to say anymore because he's
[1:13:13] present and I dismissed the audience a
[1:13:16] few people
[1:13:18] saw the pillar fire most of them didn't
[1:13:22] but when the
[1:13:23] photographers developed the film that
[1:13:25] night this is the only picture that came
[1:13:28] out all the others were
[1:13:30] blank God is
[1:13:33] faithful now this picture's been around
[1:13:35] the world millions of times and brother
[1:13:38] BR says it's better if you have the
[1:13:39] picture than if the real thing came in
[1:13:40] the room because your eyes can't deceive
[1:13:42] you you know and so uh one one testimony
[1:13:45] is when he he was in a prayer line he
[1:13:47] had people lined up and this lady's
[1:13:49] carrying her picture she had bought out
[1:13:51] front and she's there to be prayed for
[1:13:54] and so he says oh I see you have one of
[1:13:56] the pictures he said let's talk about
[1:13:58] that for a minute he said on my desk at
[1:14:01] home I've got a testimony of where that
[1:14:04] a lady was in the hospital dying already
[1:14:07] given up and she had this picture on the
[1:14:10] staying beside her bread and her
[1:14:13] testimony was that the light the light
[1:14:14] came off the picture and came over her
[1:14:17] she got healed went home that's happened
[1:14:19] many times in our time now so it's very
[1:14:24] important and to the
[1:14:26] naysayers have a good day see at the
[1:14:28] Finish Line we're not going to argue we
[1:14:31] know what we
[1:14:33] believe and if if William brandom
[1:14:35] doesn't fulfill the the scripture of
[1:14:38] Matthew 17:12 then you go find it
[1:14:40] because Jesus said he's coming so you go
[1:14:43] find him let me know but we believe he
[1:14:45] fulfilled it
[1:14:47] okay so long time later whenever you
[1:14:50] know Rebecca was listening to the tape
[1:14:52] and she hears brother R tell this whole
[1:14:54] story
[1:14:55] she says to her mom now you were the
[1:14:57] only one there that I know did you see
[1:14:59] 500 ushers and the mother says no dear
[1:15:02] those weren't ushers those are
[1:15:04] angels that other dimension God watching
[1:15:08] how many times this past month of July
[1:15:11] was God looking after you you had no
[1:15:14] idea you could have got T-boned and
[1:15:17] killed or whatever God watches over his
[1:15:20] own every
[1:15:22] day so there's many other things that we
[1:15:24] could do um point out about this uh
[1:15:27] about this prophetic Dimension but just
[1:15:30] one in particular because I know it's
[1:15:32] controversial with some people um when
[1:15:36] brother Rand moved to Arizona January of
[1:15:39] 63 one of the first things he did was he
[1:15:42] had a had a Rolodex thing with Andes he
[1:15:45] sent out invitation to his people come
[1:15:48] to Jeron bill March 17 to
[1:15:52] 23rd there Seven Seals and so um he sent
[1:15:56] that invitation out okay the Lord told
[1:15:58] him to do that well in the
[1:16:00] meantime um he
[1:16:02] always was in Arizona for the wild pig
[1:16:06] hunt since
[1:16:07] 1947 because that's something he liked
[1:16:10] to do it was that was the season for it
[1:16:13] it varied every year a little bit but uh
[1:16:15] he promised these two brothers will go
[1:16:18] okay well that particular year the
[1:16:22] season started on March 1st
[1:16:25] and then he gets a phone call and some
[1:16:27] of you Old-Timers might remember we used
[1:16:29] to have a radio program called um uh
[1:16:32] chaplain Ray it was a prison ministry
[1:16:34] and so this chaplain was a friend of
[1:16:36] brother brand so he called brother
[1:16:38] Brandon one day there in early 63 and he
[1:16:40] said now look um we've got a we've got a
[1:16:43] case over here in Houston where that
[1:16:46] there's these two kids they were
[1:16:48] involved in robbery last year somebody
[1:16:50] got killed so they put it on them and
[1:16:52] they're facing the death penalty here in
[1:16:53] Houston
[1:16:55] and the boy is a son to one of the two
[1:16:59] photographers from 1950 so there's a
[1:17:02] link he said would you please come and
[1:17:06] help us pray that they won't get the
[1:17:08] death penalty brother R said sure will
[1:17:11] he said if I don't go and they kill them
[1:17:13] I can never hunt again so he agreed to
[1:17:16] go well so those are the three things
[1:17:19] that are coming up and then he met me
[1:17:21] and that was another pressure but you
[1:17:22] know we survived that one um
[1:17:25] um so the uh the seals are for
[1:17:30] Jeffersonville March 17th so we're back
[1:17:33] up over here to the first of the month
[1:17:34] of March and um the um the first thing
[1:17:39] that comes up is he's promised these
[1:17:41] guys to go hunting which starts on the 1
[1:17:45] but if you listen closely on tape he
[1:17:46] says first I went to Houston then I went
[1:17:49] hunting a that changes things well
[1:17:53] because the only place we have that the
[1:17:56] picture that's so famous that's gone
[1:17:57] around the world in the Life Magazine is
[1:18:00] dated February
[1:18:02] 28th
[1:18:04] okay naal National Geographic has paid
[1:18:07] photographers they've R the planet
[1:18:08] getting nice pictures Life Magazine
[1:18:10] prints pictures they send them so this
[1:18:12] man was out he took these pictures and
[1:18:15] he sent it in
[1:18:17] well uh that that'll come up a little
[1:18:19] later okay but for now he goes to
[1:18:23] Houston which is a thousand miles from
[1:18:26] Tucson prays for the you know in this
[1:18:29] prayer meeting it's on tape and then
[1:18:31] that night they get in the car and they
[1:18:32] go all the way back to Tucson to keep
[1:18:34] his word to the hunters Jeffersonville
[1:18:37] is over here the other way and so he
[1:18:40] figures he can go take care of that and
[1:18:41] then get over there by the
[1:18:43] 17th and so he gets back to Tucson
[1:18:46] changes clothes gets his rifle out and
[1:18:50] they go hunting and when he tells the
[1:18:52] story about the h hunting and the cloud
[1:18:56] and so forth he says I already had mine
[1:18:59] means I got it yesterday he says now
[1:19:02] we're the three of us at this fire that
[1:19:05] night and Visions are coming he's
[1:19:09] telling these guys about their families
[1:19:10] he says it got so heavy I just get to
[1:19:12] walk away couldn't take any
[1:19:14] longer the next day which would have
[1:19:17] been March the 8th they're out there
[1:19:20] hunting you know he already had his so
[1:19:22] he's trying to run these pigs over so
[1:19:24] those guys guys can get theirs and
[1:19:26] that's when the blast went off and so
[1:19:29] forth
[1:19:31] now he comes back with the brothers he
[1:19:34] never said did you see he said did you
[1:19:36] hear that okay yeah the blast well they
[1:19:39] had some words and took off preach at
[1:19:42] Jeffersonville so that's the short
[1:19:45] version of when and how the cloud
[1:19:48] appeared besides that it was a sign to
[1:19:51] him for him the angel simply said go
[1:19:54] back to Jeffersonville preach Seven
[1:19:56] Seals and when he's going to the bulit
[1:19:58] for the first service he stops at
[1:20:01] Billy's office and he says now look
[1:20:02] Billy if you ever prayed for daddy pray
[1:20:05] now I don't have any idea what I'm going
[1:20:07] to tell these people so the Angels
[1:20:09] didn't give them the big list they said
[1:20:11] go it'll be given to you as you need it
[1:20:15] same thing for us today he gives us what
[1:20:18] we need as we need it we don't need to
[1:20:20] know how deep the streets or gold are
[1:20:22] and all these details no just get there
[1:20:27] okay okay so we get to the end of
[1:20:30] 1963 and those of you that have been in
[1:20:33] love know that when your girlfriend goes
[1:20:36] away for a week or two but it seems like
[1:20:40] a whole year you know so I knew they
[1:20:42] were going to go to Jeffersonville
[1:20:44] preach you know Christmas and come back
[1:20:47] we'll be back in school in January but
[1:20:50] you know Thumper hair wouldn't let me
[1:20:52] alone so I hit the ride some other
[1:20:55] people and got there for uh Sunday
[1:20:58] morning December
[1:20:59] 29 first time in the brown Tabernacle
[1:21:02] wow you know and so between
[1:21:05] Services I go out to eat with the family
[1:21:08] and um brother Ram knew that Rebecca and
[1:21:10] I both were in in school you know choir
[1:21:13] music and he said I love George at the
[1:21:15] service tonight I want you to sing me
[1:21:19] the brandom
[1:21:20] Tabernacle he said yeah he said tonight
[1:21:22] we're going to have um we're going to
[1:21:24] have prayer l so it'd be good if you
[1:21:26] could sing then Jesus came well I never
[1:21:29] heard that song but I learned it and he
[1:21:32] was pleased and very pleased that his
[1:21:33] daughter played for the first time in
[1:21:35] the service and he came out and preached
[1:21:37] Look Away to Jesus well time passes and
[1:21:42] um we uh we graduated together in May of
[1:21:46] 1964 we got three hours to go remember
[1:21:50] and so this was a very proud day for
[1:21:52] William Brandon oh he said finally
[1:21:55] brandom was
[1:21:58] graduated big day in July of 64 he's
[1:22:02] preaching over here in Philadelphia and
[1:22:05] you know when you when you would go to
[1:22:07] the service with brother brandom um he
[1:22:10] didn't get here for the song service and
[1:22:11] the offering he'd get here in time to
[1:22:13] preach you know he's under the anointing
[1:22:15] so they drive to the service some big
[1:22:19] Auditorium there and so was brother
[1:22:21] brandom and Billy and Rebecca and her
[1:22:24] friend Betty before them they arrived
[1:22:27] well brother brandham had a had a seat
[1:22:30] they had a big long table brother or
[1:22:32] Roberts was speaking at the right as he
[1:22:34] walked in so he takes his seat over here
[1:22:37] and but there's no seat for the girls
[1:22:40] they found them two chairs up in them
[1:22:41] mes some so they could see and hear and
[1:22:45] so while brother Ram sitting there
[1:22:46] waiting his turn he reaches over and
[1:22:49] just barely touches the suit you know
[1:22:51] real careful and um so then he spoke
[1:22:56] that Mighty message the uh unveiling of
[1:22:59] the Mighty
[1:23:00] God and so then after service and they
[1:23:04] leaving Rebecca said I saw what you did
[1:23:08] touching his suit he said oh sis you
[1:23:10] wouldn't believe it was a fine fine suit
[1:23:14] well yeah probably $3,000 suit the man
[1:23:17] had to have the V you know and so
[1:23:18] brother R looked down at his own clothes
[1:23:21] didn't match it was you know off
[1:23:24] matching probably 3995 for the whole
[1:23:26] suit and um but the point is they're
[1:23:30] both called of God they both had a part
[1:23:33] of the puzzle but they were different
[1:23:35] you know God used them in different ways
[1:23:38] another place brother R tells about um
[1:23:41] he says now you want to see the the
[1:23:43] reason for the success of these meetings
[1:23:45] big meeting big you know uh curtain back
[1:23:49] here and he had him raised the curtain
[1:23:51] well back there behind the curtain old
[1:23:53] John Ryan the long long beard he's out
[1:23:55] there praying the whole
[1:23:56] time Prayer Changes Things brother
[1:24:00] rand's Ministry was not a push button
[1:24:01] Ministry I need I need I need he had to
[1:24:04] struggle the whole time you know well um
[1:24:08] I'll have to share a few things about
[1:24:10] the courtship um we couldn't have any
[1:24:13] dates during the week because we were in
[1:24:14] school you know and she had to in be in
[1:24:17] by 11:00 p.m. and so
[1:24:20] um so then we had church on Sunday so
[1:24:23] any I'm come I'm bringing Rebecca home
[1:24:26] and we live in this apartment and it's
[1:24:28] you know nothing fancy and so we're
[1:24:30] standing on the porch it's you know dark
[1:24:35] and all of a sudden the light comes on
[1:24:37] right here porch light boom 100 100
[1:24:40] watts and and the door opens a little
[1:24:43] hand comes out if I put a quarter in the
[1:24:46] hand goes back in the light goes off H
[1:24:51] success yeah that was my
[1:24:52] brother-in-law's first experience of
[1:24:56] separating Believers from their
[1:24:58] cash and when I reminded him of that he
[1:25:01] tried to tell me you weren't even a
[1:25:03] believer at the time I said well your
[1:25:05] dad thought
[1:25:07] so anyway we had some experiences but um
[1:25:10] you know now at my house with a bunch of
[1:25:13] kids and everything we had a black phone
[1:25:15] on the wall with a
[1:25:17] dial kids don't know what they look like
[1:25:20] but uh and my dad of course being you
[1:25:23] know leader of the clan he said ' we
[1:25:25] have a democracy yeah I got the
[1:25:29] vote and so he said now the phone is for
[1:25:33] uh communication not for visiting oh had
[1:25:36] thought of that unless he needed to
[1:25:38] visit and then it was different you know
[1:25:40] so I had to you know figure out how to
[1:25:43] use the phone now see
[1:25:45] today we've got our our friend here
[1:25:47] everybody's got one some people have two
[1:25:49] but back then it was on the wall and so
[1:25:52] and she only lived a block and a half
[1:25:53] away
[1:25:54] but we still like to talk on the phone
[1:25:57] it's just the way it
[1:25:59] is but his house at brother Brandon's
[1:26:02] house they had just installed a new
[1:26:04] phone ours have been there for years
[1:26:07] well this is the new technology and it
[1:26:09] was push button but it was still a desk
[1:26:11] phone with the wire you know wasn't
[1:26:13] walkway phone and so people started
[1:26:15] calling him you know we should I buy the
[1:26:18] white car or the blue car well now if
[1:26:21] they ask Brother Sam who cares by
[1:26:23] whatever you want but but he was kind
[1:26:26] well he got tired of that you know so
[1:26:28] he's looking at the bottom of the phone
[1:26:29] and he's got a dial down there if you
[1:26:32] turn it one way ringer gets louder if
[1:26:35] you turn it the other way goes off what
[1:26:38] do you think he did turned it off so so
[1:26:41] if you're calling you can hear it
[1:26:42] ringing but you can't hear it over there
[1:26:44] because it's
[1:26:45] off so Rebecca says what are we going to
[1:26:48] do I said it's real simple said you set
[1:26:51] your your watch just like mine okay got
[1:26:54] it
[1:26:54] now when it's exactly 7:00 I'm going to
[1:26:57] call you thanks to your dad there's no
[1:26:59] ringer so you have to believe me so so
[1:27:03] sure enough 7 o'cl picks it up hello and
[1:27:07] then I had this long cord so she could
[1:27:08] take the phone and go in the closet we
[1:27:10] can have some
[1:27:11] privacy so love conquers
[1:27:15] all um so yeah so I had this clean
[1:27:19] pickup truck okay tried to keep it clean
[1:27:21] lived on dirt road but um but brother am
[1:27:24] had a Cadillac back then that was the
[1:27:29] luxury car of the time he didn't buy it
[1:27:32] somebody gave it to him so he had this
[1:27:34] 55 Fleetwood Cadillac about from here to
[1:27:37] the
[1:27:39] door had two four barrel carburetors you
[1:27:43] loved it big air conditioning very nice
[1:27:47] and sometimes he' you know let us use
[1:27:49] that and um but see his his car took the
[1:27:53] EXP expensive gas and there there was no
[1:27:56] self- pump you had to have the guy come
[1:27:58] out and do it and the Cadillac took the
[1:28:01] gas it was 36 Cents a gallon where my
[1:28:04] truck would take to 22 cents a
[1:28:06] gallon so we'd buy $2 at a time you
[1:28:10] know well anyway so I'm taking her to
[1:28:12] the Baptist Church he was happy that she
[1:28:14] was in church and um I don't ever
[1:28:17] remember taking her brother and her
[1:28:18] sister but took her and so here I'm in
[1:28:21] this this pickup truck uh you know two
[1:28:24] doors so there's me and Rebecca and my
[1:28:26] sister and in the back was my little
[1:28:28] brother and sisters you know and they um
[1:28:32] uh yeah open air no problem a long time
[1:28:35] ago some we used to drink out of a hose
[1:28:36] you
[1:28:39] know and so he would come out to tell us
[1:28:41] goodbye one time he comes out to say
[1:28:43] goodbye to us that he was home and he
[1:28:45] said my what a fine trunkload of
[1:28:47] preachers you have here I didn't see
[1:28:49] preachers I just saw little brothers you
[1:28:51] know sure enough they all going to Bible
[1:28:54] school they're all preachers today so
[1:28:57] God knows what he's
[1:28:59] doing
[1:29:00] yeah well um by the end of
[1:29:05] 64 God tells his Prophet now look you're
[1:29:07] going to stay here so you need to look
[1:29:09] for a house now he could have given him
[1:29:11] the address and go find it no he just
[1:29:13] said you go find a house so he starts
[1:29:15] looking and looking and he found a place
[1:29:17] where he could see the mountains very
[1:29:18] easily and they had space to build on
[1:29:20] din room that he wanted to put his guns
[1:29:22] and his trophies and everything in
[1:29:24] so he goes and makes a deal on his house
[1:29:27] so while he's making the deal the the
[1:29:31] Builder had almost finished it but he
[1:29:33] wanted to leave it so that the owner
[1:29:35] could you know trim it out the way they
[1:29:37] wanted so the the Builder standing
[1:29:40] outside and brother Ram standing in the
[1:29:42] doorway and they're talking uh about the
[1:29:46] house well in the meantime here's Joseph
[1:29:48] you know 8 years old and you know how
[1:29:50] little kids are they run their fingers
[1:29:51] every place and so he's running his
[1:29:53] finger up the the door jam and um he's
[1:29:57] about this far from the the lock you
[1:29:58] know from the hole and so brother ry's
[1:30:01] talking to this man without even
[1:30:02] flinching P pulls out his knife sticks
[1:30:05] it in a hole and brings out a
[1:30:08] scorpion this is is the way he lived
[1:30:11] because he he was a
[1:30:13] prophet well um so anyway they found the
[1:30:17] house so all of 65 they're finishing out
[1:30:19] this house and building the den room and
[1:30:20] the driveway and all the stuff some of
[1:30:22] you have been out there and seen it and
[1:30:24] um and so that's basically what was
[1:30:27] happening all 1965 well in May of' 65 I
[1:30:31] uh I U had this great idea you know I
[1:30:35] wasn't baptized right yet I didn't have
[1:30:40] a car yet I didn't have a job didn't
[1:30:42] have money didn't have a house I thought
[1:30:43] I needed a
[1:30:46] wife yeah I was you know like
[1:30:52] something and so I was brave enough to
[1:30:54] go talk to the man and so here again
[1:30:58] it's just me and him in the in the room
[1:31:00] and so he starts talking a little bit
[1:31:03] nervous kind of knew what I was there
[1:31:05] for no doubt and so he starts telling
[1:31:07] these trips and different things going
[1:31:09] on seem like went on for a long time and
[1:31:11] I said well brother R that's all
[1:31:13] beautiful but I'm here for a purpose oh
[1:31:16] what would that
[1:31:18] be I said well you must notice I really
[1:31:20] like your daughter yeah well I want your
[1:31:23] blessing and your your permission to
[1:31:24] marry well everything changed that eyes
[1:31:27] got real
[1:31:28] narrow and
[1:31:30] um he said well I'll tell you what I'll
[1:31:33] give youall permission to be engaged but
[1:31:35] don't even think about marriage until
[1:31:37] you both have the baptism of the Holy
[1:31:38] Ghost
[1:31:41] wow and um I said yes sir now a smart
[1:31:44] person would have hit the floor okay
[1:31:46] what's step one you know tell me no life
[1:31:49] went
[1:31:50] on life went on that was May and um and
[1:31:54] then you know they go away again for
[1:31:56] about six weeks in in the summertime and
[1:31:59] I don't know how I got there but I ended
[1:32:01] up back to jville for two three weeks
[1:32:03] and I was there when he was preaching
[1:32:05] ano once the end time I was sitting from
[1:32:08] here to the piano he was all just going
[1:32:10] right over I was I was listening you
[1:32:13] know and what's the attraction on the
[1:32:15] mountain events made clear by prophecy
[1:32:17] and so forth so on on April on August
[1:32:20] 1st he preached uh morning and night and
[1:32:24] I knew that that week which would have
[1:32:25] been 59 years ago now I knew we were
[1:32:28] going to get in the station wagon and go
[1:32:29] to
[1:32:30] Jeffersonville so I said now look before
[1:32:32] we go will you have time to baptize me
[1:32:35] correctly oh sure well we had been
[1:32:37] waiting three years for that so Monday
[1:32:40] morning which would have been August the
[1:32:43] 2nd of
[1:32:44] 1965 we go down to the church and he uh
[1:32:48] here again no shirt just the way it was
[1:32:50] back then and there two or three people
[1:32:53] in the audience for for Witnesses and he
[1:32:55] baptized me in the name of the Lord
[1:32:56] Jesus Christ was 59 years ago and uh
[1:33:00] that was the last person he baptized as
[1:33:02] far as I
[1:33:03] know well so now we're in Tucson and um
[1:33:07] so now I got the girl under contract got
[1:33:10] a car I got the baptism we're making
[1:33:14] progress you know so we're driving
[1:33:16] around in my car one day and he says man
[1:33:18] I really like this you know just me and
[1:33:20] my wife this' be good and he said and
[1:33:22] then out of nowhere it seemed like he
[1:33:23] said if you ever get a chance to go to
[1:33:24] the Holy Land your Bible will be a brand
[1:33:26] new book well that's interesting I
[1:33:29] wasn't thinking about Holy Land I was
[1:33:31] talking thinking about the girl you
[1:33:33] know and um so you know prophets they
[1:33:37] see what we can't see and so last June
[1:33:41] uh was trip number 48 so we've been
[1:33:43] there many times we know where not to
[1:33:45] stop where to stop but right now it's
[1:33:48] war and you would believe everywhere I
[1:33:51] go the last three weeks
[1:33:54] when are we going to go back to Israel
[1:33:56] they're having a war I don't know I
[1:33:59] guess people don't read the news but you
[1:34:01] know it's serious people getting killed
[1:34:03] over there no we're not going right now
[1:34:05] so if the Lord carries maybe someday
[1:34:08] soon but um
[1:34:11] anyway uh September of 65 brother R's
[1:34:14] preaching in Phoenix and so I took rebec
[1:34:17] and so I L her I let her out at the door
[1:34:20] this big hotel and I go to park the car
[1:34:22] well she comes in to the lobby of the
[1:34:26] hotel and you ladies know when you first
[1:34:29] get the ring it seems like that hand's
[1:34:31] Always
[1:34:34] Somewhere they're just like
[1:34:36] that and so she comes into this Lobby
[1:34:38] and here's her friend you know other
[1:34:40] lady standing in there and she sees the
[1:34:43] ring and she
[1:34:45] says is that what George gave you yeah
[1:34:49] but Rebecca he's Baptist you know
[1:34:53] and so Rebecca says yeah but daddy likes
[1:34:59] it well
[1:35:01] um also in September when brother R had
[1:35:04] the experience with the uh Sabino Canyon
[1:35:07] you know little squirrel jumped at him
[1:35:11] and hit the cactus and all that well we
[1:35:13] were we were there at that time I wasn't
[1:35:15] in Sao Canyon but I was at the house
[1:35:17] when he came back and he was very happy
[1:35:19] well it just so happened that brother
[1:35:20] green was in town from Texas because he
[1:35:24] his mother was a seamstress and she was
[1:35:28] she' made all the drapes for the new
[1:35:29] house so he was in town putting up the
[1:35:31] drapes you know getting things
[1:35:33] ready and so brother brandom said to him
[1:35:36] one day he said look looks like this
[1:35:37] guy's going to be my my son-in-law take
[1:35:40] him home and pray for the Holy Ghost why
[1:35:43] didn't brother B just put his hand on me
[1:35:45] know wasn't God's plan so anyway so here
[1:35:48] I go to um here I go to Texas with
[1:35:51] brother perie green and that's when I
[1:35:54] was introduced to
[1:35:56] humidity oh yeah Houston Texas August
[1:36:00] September and so I'm over there and um
[1:36:04] so I was there about two days and
[1:36:07] brother um another brother came over
[1:36:10] from Louisiana to use brother Green's
[1:36:13] phone to call brother brandom it's four
[1:36:15] times you know so he comes over brother
[1:36:18] Blair's his name so he calls him that
[1:36:21] day and brother Brandon's already out of
[1:36:23] the house
[1:36:24] he said but when he comes back we'll
[1:36:25] have him call you so they're wa they're
[1:36:27] sitting there waiting by the phone all
[1:36:28] day so I'm over in my room I come over
[1:36:31] and say what do we what if we just the
[1:36:33] three of us pray so we kneel down at the
[1:36:36] bench we're
[1:36:37] praying they're not beating on my back
[1:36:39] they knew why I was there I didn't know
[1:36:42] why I was there I just knew it'd be good
[1:36:43] idea if the three of us praying and so
[1:36:46] while we're praying uh I could still see
[1:36:49] in my mind just like a cloudy Sky when
[1:36:53] there's breaks in the clouds and these
[1:36:55] shafts of light come through you know
[1:36:58] and um so about then the phone rings so
[1:37:01] brother green goes answerers phone and
[1:37:03] was brother random calling for the other
[1:37:05] brother but he said first let me talk to
[1:37:06] George so I greeted him and he said I
[1:37:09] want to be first to congratulate you on
[1:37:11] receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:37:14] you see it's different for every
[1:37:17] person that's good that's a mistake the
[1:37:19] Pentecostals made well hey that one
[1:37:21] spoke in tongu so everybody no that's
[1:37:23] not the way it works it's different for
[1:37:26] everybody it's just like you know
[1:37:28] everybody's got a different color shirt
[1:37:29] on we're all going to have a different
[1:37:30] kind of lunch we're
[1:37:33] different and so um then I got a call
[1:37:37] the next day from my mother in Arizona
[1:37:40] and she said hey we got a letter here
[1:37:41] from President Johnson they need you in
[1:37:43] the in the service so within a week I
[1:37:45] was a US Soldier with the Holy Ghost for
[1:37:48] two years yeah and so they sent me to
[1:37:52] Fort po Siana it was worse than Houston
[1:37:55] it was armpit of the world you know and
[1:37:58] um so I'm down there and brother brand
[1:38:01] was preaching in shreport Thanksgiving
[1:38:04] so Rebecca came down and got me and I
[1:38:06] was in some of those Services there in
[1:38:08] shreport
[1:38:10] 1965 so on Saturday morning I had some
[1:38:13] time just a few minutes with him and I
[1:38:15] was concerned I didn't know what they
[1:38:16] were going to do with me I just finished
[1:38:17] basic training I don't know if I was
[1:38:19] going to be a you know tank commander or
[1:38:21] what um and so he said he didn't even
[1:38:25] pray said George don't worry footsteps
[1:38:28] of the righteous order of the
[1:38:30] Lord thank
[1:38:31] you got back to the Army you're going to
[1:38:34] make a cook out of
[1:38:35] you good take care of me and a few
[1:38:38] others you know well
[1:38:41] um so back while I'm in the Army things
[1:38:45] are going on and tuon they're finishing
[1:38:46] up the house and and then I I was um
[1:38:50] given I don't know it seems like several
[1:38:52] weeks around Christmas time to go home
[1:38:55] and be with family so I was in Tucson
[1:38:58] helping them put some of the furniture
[1:38:59] together in the new house they ordered
[1:39:01] got some things ready and so he was
[1:39:04] going to leave on um on the 18th of
[1:39:09] December and um so a week or so before
[1:39:13] he says to Rebecca one day now look dear
[1:39:15] um I know you've been without a piano
[1:39:17] these three years but I've saved up $900
[1:39:21] and we're going to you and I are going
[1:39:22] to go down we're going to buy piano
[1:39:23] today okay so they go down to the piano
[1:39:26] store and he had no idea what pianos
[1:39:30] were worth but she had some idea so
[1:39:32] she's over here with the the spined
[1:39:34] pianos you know small ones And1 thousand
[1:39:36] pianos well he's wandering around the
[1:39:38] store and they opened up the big double
[1:39:40] doors in the back and they brought out
[1:39:41] from the shop uh a grand piano about the
[1:39:44] size of that one there maybe a little
[1:39:46] longer totally redone beautiful
[1:39:48] fruitwood you know what caught his
[1:39:51] attention oh says come over here look at
[1:39:53] this one no that they one embarrassing
[1:39:57] and so she got closer cuz you know he
[1:40:00] had a way
[1:40:01] of so she gets over closer and he says
[1:40:04] styo and Sons oh no Dad we can't let's
[1:40:08] not get involved here well just just
[1:40:11] play it see what it sounds like so while
[1:40:13] she's playing it gu super salesman he
[1:40:17] turns to the salesman he says how much
[1:40:19] did you take that pan right
[1:40:21] now well we'll take $0000 fine I can
[1:40:25] find $200 so he gives him a check for
[1:40:27] $1,100 they delivered the piano it went
[1:40:30] everywhere with us first thing on the
[1:40:32] truck you know and so come to
[1:40:36] 1992 we thought you know we've had this
[1:40:38] thing for several years we need to get
[1:40:40] it refinished make it look nice so
[1:40:43] Rebecca called the piano
[1:40:44] store and she told him you know we
[1:40:47] bought this piano and we want to have it
[1:40:48] refinished oh if we bought it here we
[1:40:50] got records what's the name Brandon
[1:40:54] wait a minute we sold just same with
[1:40:56] piano for
[1:40:57] $1,100 well you're looking at the check
[1:40:59] and we got the
[1:41:00] piano and um so he said well the man
[1:41:03] that refinished it then 65 he's still
[1:41:06] here he's got room for one more you're
[1:41:08] it so they came and got the piano they
[1:41:11] refinished it looks beautiful they
[1:41:12] delivered it well that cost us
[1:41:15] $3,500 and we thought we might want to
[1:41:17] take some insurance on
[1:41:20] this so we had an estimate made 9 two is
[1:41:23] worth
[1:41:24] 25,000 so it's a good investment and my
[1:41:29] daughter's got it today but um so anyway
[1:41:33] the the idea was the brands are going to
[1:41:35] go to Jeffersonville for Christmas 65
[1:41:38] and they're going to leave Rebecca in
[1:41:39] town so that she can move the stuff out
[1:41:41] of the apartment up to the house and
[1:41:43] when they come back from
[1:41:45] preaching they can move right into the
[1:41:47] new house well when brother renham
[1:41:50] traveled he had some very strict rules
[1:41:54] for one thing the Bible was always the
[1:41:56] last thing into the suitcase that way
[1:41:58] there's nothing on top of the Bible and
[1:42:00] if you listen to very long to the tapes
[1:42:03] he says you don't put anything on top of
[1:42:05] your Bible not even my
[1:42:09] books so I'm
[1:42:13] watching number two he liked to leave
[1:42:15] very early at six o'clock he's rolling
[1:42:18] he doesn't care if everybody go to sleep
[1:42:19] he wants to get there well I wasn't
[1:42:22] going to get up and you know 5:00 and go
[1:42:24] say goodbye so I go up the night of the
[1:42:26] 17th to say goodbye to him which will be
[1:42:28] a Friday night and um so I'm in his room
[1:42:32] and the third thing that he was very
[1:42:33] strict about was if he was traveling
[1:42:36] just by himself or with Billy Paul he
[1:42:39] would wear some boots and some blue
[1:42:41] jeans and his shirt but if he was
[1:42:43] traveling with family he'd dress up a
[1:42:45] little bit you know so here I in the
[1:42:48] room with him and we're talking a little
[1:42:50] bit and I noticed on the chair by the
[1:42:52] door is his clothes for the next day and
[1:42:55] it's the boots and the blue jeans and I
[1:42:57] asked him what's this all about and he
[1:43:00] said well the guy never knows what he
[1:43:01] might have car
[1:43:04] trouble I knew this guy never had
[1:43:06] trouble with the car because he kept it
[1:43:08] very sharp but I didn't say anything he
[1:43:11] didn't say anything and less than 24
[1:43:14] hours later he' been a terrible head-on
[1:43:16] collision which we don't we're go into
[1:43:18] all that right now but um uh that
[1:43:22] happened happened on Saturday evening on
[1:43:25] the 18th of December the next day was
[1:43:29] Sunday 19th we caught a flight over to
[1:43:32] Amarillo and uh people starting to
[1:43:35] gather there was no cell phones the only
[1:43:37] phone the only way to communicate was
[1:43:38] put quarters in the phone and so people
[1:43:41] were starting to come in you know and
[1:43:42] there's a lot of opinions and this is
[1:43:44] going to happen he's going to come
[1:43:45] walking out any minute just watching all
[1:43:47] these uninformed opinions you
[1:43:50] know and so we're sitting there and I
[1:43:53] noticed there's a Mexican family sitting
[1:43:55] way over here by themselves and so I go
[1:43:57] over to talk to them and u i
[1:44:03] um come to find
[1:44:05] out their grandson was in the other
[1:44:09] car so when they had the head- on
[1:44:11] collision there's these four drunk guys
[1:44:13] one died right on the spot this was
[1:44:16] another one I don't know where the other
[1:44:17] two were anyway I got to talking to them
[1:44:19] a little bit and that was it was
[1:44:22] 10-minute encoun
[1:44:24] never heard another word never saw him
[1:44:26] again but about two years ago come to
[1:44:29] realize that there's a man in Dallas
[1:44:31] right now who is the
[1:44:35] great-grandson and that man that was in
[1:44:37] the hospital the young man he became a
[1:44:40] Christian started preaching the gospel
[1:44:43] but he always lived under that cloud we
[1:44:46] helped kill Le
[1:44:48] random that would be a terrible
[1:44:50] situation but anyway
[1:44:53] um so the time you know people are there
[1:44:56] and I got in to see him once because it
[1:44:59] was very strict I had him all bandaged
[1:45:01] up had a trachea with him couldn't talk
[1:45:03] or nothing but you know there was there
[1:45:05] was 12 beds in that in that
[1:45:08] ICU and a lot of people praying a lot of
[1:45:12] faith um but during those six days he
[1:45:15] was there the other 11 beds got better
[1:45:18] walked out but on the evening of the
[1:45:21] 24th of December God said that's enough
[1:45:24] we took him home well we were like the
[1:45:28] disciples now what you know we had
[1:45:31] planned on this part of it brother REM
[1:45:33] says you're going to find out one of
[1:45:34] these days that when you go to heaven
[1:45:36] you don't fly off somewhere else you're
[1:45:37] still right here just in another
[1:45:40] dimension faster than
[1:45:41] this they're not a million miles
[1:45:45] away
[1:45:48] so
[1:45:50] um there was a lot of things going on
[1:45:53] but on the 29th of December they're
[1:45:55] going to have a funeral in jville they
[1:45:57] transported the body family went up well
[1:46:01] you see I wasn't blood relative so I
[1:46:03] couldn't stay I had to go back to the
[1:46:04] Army and um the uh the funeral director
[1:46:10] want know should we bury him here well
[1:46:14] sister ROM didn't already know what day
[1:46:15] it was bil he wasn't going to make a
[1:46:17] decision so he said fine I'll keep him
[1:46:20] you guys decide what you're going to do
[1:46:22] we know the word says for God has not
[1:46:24] given us a spirit of fear but of power
[1:46:26] and of love and a sound mind the word is
[1:46:29] always
[1:46:31] right and also in Philippians and the
[1:46:33] peace of God which passes all
[1:46:35] understanding all things you can
[1:46:37] understand God's peace goes way beyond
[1:46:39] that shall keep your hearts and Minds
[1:46:41] through Christ Jesus so here I in the
[1:46:44] Army Family struggling we learned to to
[1:46:47] pray listen learn and um we became
[1:46:52] anchored in the word you know missionary
[1:46:55] work began printing began and everything
[1:46:58] and um so comes time
[1:47:02] for uh
[1:47:03] my orders you went through cook school
[1:47:08] and now we're going to send you some
[1:47:09] place well I knew what God had done for
[1:47:12] me I knew God done something for Rebecca
[1:47:14] so I called her one day I said hey let's
[1:47:16] get married next Tuesday you bet so I go
[1:47:20] to Tucson have a private ceremony I took
[1:47:23] a honeymoon trip back to Indiana because
[1:47:25] there's going to be a burial on August
[1:47:28] 11th on a
[1:47:30] Monday and so U we U we uh go to this
[1:47:36] burial excuse me and all through Billy
[1:47:40] Paul's life he'd always kept touch with
[1:47:42] his with his grandmother Hope's mother
[1:47:45] but Hope's mother was a very difficult
[1:47:47] person she very hard never cried never
[1:47:50] went to church nothing but it was his
[1:47:51] grandma so when he goes to the burial on
[1:47:54] that Monday morning he leaves his two
[1:47:56] little boys with Grandma and he goes to
[1:47:59] the burial well as is typical in Indiana
[1:48:02] there's a light rain falling this all
[1:48:05] day and so when he comes back to pick up
[1:48:08] his little boys the grandmother says
[1:48:11] even the heavens weep for that man and
[1:48:15] for the first time Billy sees his mother
[1:48:17] his grandmother wiping her eyes and um
[1:48:21] so then we left that day and flew to
[1:48:24] California and on the 15th of April I
[1:48:28] flew off to Vietnam for one year and uh
[1:48:32] Rebecca had to take care of her mother
[1:48:34] her brother sister and learn how to take
[1:48:38] care of everything you know all of a
[1:48:41] sudden so after my two years in the
[1:48:44] military got back and um started working
[1:48:49] with the printing operation setting type
[1:48:51] and Spanish translations all that began
[1:48:55] in October of
[1:48:58] 67 and all these years we've been
[1:49:02] translating and speaking on the tapes
[1:49:06] printing the books all that's been going
[1:49:08] on the whole time I was just in Mexico
[1:49:10] this last uh last week in fact and they
[1:49:14] want books so we're printing books in
[1:49:16] China printing books in Mexico and
[1:49:18] Colombia and South America for the
[1:49:21] people they they want a book they they
[1:49:22] can read and underline turn back two
[1:49:24] pages so that's going on it's still
[1:49:27] going on and we're just glad that we can
[1:49:30] be part of something that honors God
[1:49:33] something where these people they want
[1:49:35] to know what did he say how did he say
[1:49:37] it and uh uh so we if we fast forward 40
[1:49:42] years we come to October of 2006 and
[1:49:46] Rebecca was very sick she had been
[1:49:48] through uh cancer operation where that
[1:49:51] they took out the the
[1:49:53] um uh tumor and the
[1:49:56] kidney and they're watching her very
[1:49:58] close and I I can see that she's not
[1:50:01] getting well it just keeps deteriorating
[1:50:03] you know I said look you're not just
[1:50:06] somebody you live 19 years with around
[1:50:08] you know what Miracles are you know what
[1:50:09] faith is God can put you back brand new
[1:50:12] in the next 10 minutes but if he chooses
[1:50:14] to take you home look for your dad and
[1:50:17] wait for me there well
[1:50:21] um few days later a sister called from
[1:50:25] over here in West
[1:50:26] Virginia and she said now I was s
[1:50:29] getting up from the table today at noon
[1:50:31] and there was a vision right in front of
[1:50:33] me it's all these people brother Brown
[1:50:36] preaching faith and here's the prayer
[1:50:37] line it was all going on in this vision
[1:50:41] and he's looked up to me and you little
[1:50:43] sister thank you for praying for my
[1:50:45] daughter Rebecca and tell George
[1:50:47] everything's going to be all right but
[1:50:49] when you hear your name from the other
[1:50:50] dimension you pay attention you know so

[1:50:55] way I want them but it's going to be
[1:50:57] okay well sure enough November 28th of

[1:51:12] right up until Christmas right now and
[1:51:15] uh focus is beyond the curtain of time
[1:51:17] because this thing is winding up brother
[1:51:20] R said in 1964 if things go on the way
[1:51:23] they are right now whatever he was
[1:51:24] looking at 50 years would be Total
[1:51:27] Insanity so that Circle closed in 2014
[1:51:31] we've been in Total Insanity for 10
[1:51:34] years it's

[1:51:39] got common sense and live by a level the
[1:51:42] rest of doesn't matter so yeah we're
[1:51:45] very very busy and you know balance is
[1:51:47] very essential so for every one of you

[1:52:02] don't care how much broccoli you eat you
[1:52:04] won't go past that line God has a time
[1:52:06] to take you
[1:52:08] home you know and uh for those of you
[1:52:12] that are gathering numbers uh we were
[1:52:16] married just over 40 years we have three
[1:52:19] children they're all in they're all in
[1:52:21] church today
[1:52:23] three grandchildren two of them are
[1:52:24] married they're all serving the lord and
[1:52:28] um a lot of times we have questions and
[1:52:30] answers I see with you people it would
[1:52:32] take about 30 minutes because you're
[1:52:33] well taught you wouldn't have a lot of
[1:52:34] questions but when there's 6,000
[1:52:37] Africans and first time I've been there
[1:52:40] so the brother says now we don't know
[1:52:43] when brother George is coming back but
[1:52:44] but do anybody got any questions well
[1:52:46] all they have is time they don't no
[1:52:48] hurry to go you know they probably
[1:52:50] brought a little lunch but you look out
[1:52:52] there's 6,000 people you look outside
[1:52:54] and there's 10 cars and there's probably
[1:52:57] uh U maybe 200
[1:52:59] motorcycles and about 500 bicycles
[1:53:02] everybody else walked so they're no
[1:53:04] hurry to go any place well these
[1:53:06] questions keep coming and I got to
[1:53:07] translate I got to translate the
[1:53:09] answer the only question I remember um
[1:53:13] this sister sent up a question well
[1:53:16] since the Lord took your your wife why
[1:53:18] you still wearing the
[1:53:20] ring people notice everything
[1:53:24] I said well because my commitment to
[1:53:26] Rebecca wasn't until death departs for
[1:53:28] eternity oh
[1:53:30] okay and of course later I realized
[1:53:33] there's a secondary reason scare away
[1:53:35] desperate
[1:53:37] women you'd be
[1:53:42] surprised so my humble advice to you
[1:53:44] married people pay
[1:53:47] attention make her laugh every day
[1:53:51] whether she just laughing at you
[1:53:53] but make her
[1:53:55] happy okay right and um you know every
[1:54:01] every day people are looking at us to
[1:54:02] see how we living our Christianity we
[1:54:05] claim to be Believers we claim to be at
[1:54:06] the top of the pyramid really why is
[1:54:09] everybody so depressed looking down
[1:54:11] we're Victorious
[1:54:13] Christians scripture says by this shall
[1:54:15] all those people know that you're my
[1:54:17] disciples if you have love one to the
[1:54:19] other yeah but he doesn't believe just
[1:54:22] like me and his Pastor love one another
[1:54:26] very simple so um we're just very glad
[1:54:32] today to be involved with missionary
[1:54:34] work in many countries not just the
[1:54:37] printing but sending clothes sending
[1:54:40] stuff they need to these places that
[1:54:42] don't have anything like right now you
[1:54:45] probably noticed in the news last Sunday
[1:54:47] they had big election in Venezuela it
[1:54:50] looks like that the opposition is won
[1:54:52] they're going to finally put away the 25
[1:54:54] years of dictatorship and kind of get
[1:54:56] things a little more balanced but things
[1:54:59] are expensive they don't have a lot of
[1:55:01] stuff so I send them boxes of stuff
[1:55:04] every couple weeks and um they they need
[1:55:08] money for for groceries you know we're
[1:55:11] helping them so the the gospel has
[1:55:14] reached very very high levels of the
[1:55:16] drug World either you have a relative or
[1:55:20] a friend somebody you know that's hooked
[1:55:23] on the drugs it's everywhere and the
[1:55:26] only reason there's drugs coming is
[1:55:28] because people are wanted here it's a
[1:55:30] it's a supply and demand and so the
[1:55:33] gospel has reached some of these high
[1:55:35] level drug people they have their own
[1:55:38] network amongst themselves where they're
[1:55:40] playing Spanish translated tapes right
[1:55:42] now the gospel is is going out many have
[1:55:46] been baptized their main guy is in is in
[1:55:49] prison out in Colorado he's a believer
[1:55:52] he just hadn't been baptized yet so um
[1:55:57] this same brother that I told you about
[1:55:58] earlier about the dream uh he had
[1:56:02] another dream later and he said he was
[1:56:05] in heaven physically and he was talking
[1:56:09] to brother Brandon I said no wait a
[1:56:11] minute you don't talk English he doesn't
[1:56:12] talk Spanish yeah but we were
[1:56:13] communicating so whatever language and
[1:56:16] so they're talking and he's tell them
[1:56:19] yeah you know down there where I live
[1:56:21] and brother R say look
[1:56:22] I don't care what they're saying I have
[1:56:24] said everything I've had to say okay but
[1:56:28] if I was to come back the way some
[1:56:31] people want I would have to have to take
[1:56:33] a few people to the
[1:56:36] Woodshed so I don't know what all God
[1:56:38] lets them see in that Dimension but
[1:56:41] enough to know that things aren't right
[1:56:43] you
[1:56:44] know and so they talked a little bit and
[1:56:47] then he noticed there was this young
[1:56:48] girl on brother brm's arm he looks at
[1:56:50] her ah that's Rebecca of course and she
[1:56:54] gives him a big smile and she says you
[1:56:56] tell George I'm waiting right where he
[1:56:59] told me to
[1:57:00] wait so it's very
[1:57:02] real so to achieve balance get back to
[1:57:06] this again you see one of the one of the
[1:57:09] Bible characters that's almost on every
[1:57:11] tape is the woman at the
[1:57:13] well and the lesson there is God is
[1:57:17] seeking those that will worship Him in
[1:57:19] spirit and in truth not all Spirit
[1:57:23] jumping and shouting not all truth no
[1:57:27] balanced how are we going to get
[1:57:29] balanced little
[1:57:31] simple you read one chapter out of your
[1:57:33] Bible every day
[1:57:35] minimum you read one chapter one page
[1:57:38] out of your church age book
[1:57:40] minimum you listen to at least 30
[1:57:42] minutes of God's prophet and you pray if
[1:57:45] you'll do that every day you'll have a
[1:57:47] balanced life and a balanced
[1:57:51] Church it
[1:57:53] works so those are the things that we
[1:57:56] can share with you um when I come back
[1:57:59] maybe I'll have questions and answers
[1:58:02] figure out the details but you know let
[1:58:04] me just share this one thing here on
[1:58:05] Watchman one of the night 1960 brother
[1:58:07] REM says years ago there was a writer
[1:58:09] Fanny Crosby she was blind she didn't
[1:58:11] sell her Birthright like many singers
[1:58:13] today she was a different woman and uh
[1:58:16] so they came to interview her one day
[1:58:17] and they say why don't you write modern
[1:58:19] poetry why don't you write songs for the
[1:58:20] entertainment world he Saidi give all my
[1:58:23] talents to
[1:58:24] God oh then you believe there's a heaven
[1:58:27] oh yeah and you believe you're going to
[1:58:29] be there yes so they asked her well when
[1:58:32] you get there if you still blind how are
[1:58:34] you going to know
[1:58:35] him good question she said I'll feel the
[1:58:38] nail prints in his hands and she got up
[1:58:42] went in the other room and um when these
[1:58:45] people left she raised her hands and
[1:58:47] began to praise God and a strong a song
[1:58:52] struck her
[1:58:53] heart I shall know him I shall know him
[1:58:56] and Redeemed by his sight I shall
[1:58:58] stand we're going to
[1:59:01] annoy so brother Ram says and today

[1:59:10] sees him she knows him she's standing
[1:59:12] Redeemed by his side and if I would ask

[2:03:57] me you know he's a living God am he
[2:04:01] gives a living
[2:04:03] experience a real reality you know
[2:04:05] you've
[2:04:06] heard brother George's the testimony in
[2:04:10] his life and every one of us have a
[2:04:14] testimony you
[2:04:16] know for many of us outside of brother
[2:04:19] George being here we were not there in
[2:04:21] the meetings if it were not for the
[2:04:24] recording that we had of deep calls to
[2:04:26] the Deep we would have never even seen
[2:04:29] it it would have just been what we could
[2:04:32] kind of imagine what was taking place by
[2:04:36] what we were hearing on the
[2:04:38] tapes but you know every one of us it
[2:04:40] comes down to the scriptures is blessed
[2:04:44] are your eyes that never saw yet you
[2:04:50] believe bless are your ears that have
[2:04:53] heard because the same
[2:04:56] God who took brother brandom and I want
[2:04:59] you to just just catch this brother brm
[2:05:02] says this in the message the Rapture he
[2:05:05] says you hear these men saying the
[2:05:08] statements message of the hour he said
[2:05:12] what that is that's a scriptural promise
[2:05:15] that God made us in his word and he said
[2:05:19] it like this we wouldn't know
[2:05:22] where to look if the Holy Spirit didn't
[2:05:26] point it out to
[2:05:27] us so this is the spirit of God coming
[2:05:32] to reveal himself and make the promise
[2:05:36] real to us in this generation and in our
[2:05:40] lives the whole purpose of this of the
[2:05:43] message coming was to bring a
[2:05:46] relationship between us and God where
[2:05:49] all the veils man man's ideas man's
[2:05:54] man's thoughts and and all of that
[2:05:57] existed down through time but God in
[2:06:00] this hour he came and he removed the
[2:06:03] veils so that we might see him
[2:06:07] personally for who he really is you
[2:06:11] think about it we're we're standing in
[2:06:12] an hour of where Paul stood and where
[2:06:16] the disciples stood on the day of
[2:06:18] Pentecost we're standing in that hour to
[2:06:21] be able to see him face to face in this
[2:06:24] hour to where that we can truly say many
[2:06:28] of you were here when brother Jerry was
[2:06:29] preaching and remember he made the
[2:06:31] statement when they they'll say to us
[2:06:33] you follow a
[2:06:36] man we're following I mean all through
[2:06:38] the scriptures Paul said follow me as I
[2:06:40] follow Christ is that
[2:06:44] right but we're following the pillar of
[2:06:47] fire now a lot of these other examples
[2:06:50] of these other churches
[2:06:52] you press them on one scripture you
[2:06:54] could talk to them about dress we could
[2:06:56] start there very simple and you start
[2:06:59] with just that well that that's no
[2:07:02] longer that's just that's no longer
[2:07:04] needed that was just where Paul
[2:07:05] immediately you realize who's following
[2:07:08] man because the pillar of
[2:07:11] fire it is God and God is his word the
[2:07:16] spirit of truth will never lead us
[2:07:19] outside of the word that's why a real
[2:07:21] truth true experience with God it leads
[2:07:23] us into the word it leads us all the way
[2:07:27] that's why when the Holy Spirit begins
[2:07:29] to work with the life like I know you I
[2:07:32] know we heard it as brother George said
[2:07:34] it but I want you to I love hearing
[2:07:37] these parts about brother brandham you
[2:07:40] know I I spoke to you about how brother
[2:07:41] brandham worked with brother Billy Paul
[2:07:44] but then three years brother George was
[2:07:47] right there with
[2:07:48] him I want you to watch this now
[2:07:52] I could guarantee if I asked brother
[2:07:54] George the question right now brother
[2:07:56] brandham did not Badger him when he came
[2:07:58] in the house time and time again hey you
[2:08:00] going to be baptized hey come on come on
[2:08:02] you going to be baptized he didn't do
[2:08:03] that to
[2:08:05] him he didn't do that to him but one of
[2:08:08] the things that brother George mentioned
[2:08:10] there in the beginning was this was a
[2:08:12] word that was
[2:08:15] lived and everything is Sovereign in
[2:08:18] God's time just exactly hey look we're
[2:08:20] living in an urgent hour
[2:08:22] if you haven't repented and been
[2:08:23] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:08:25] Christ it's an urgent hour today is the
[2:08:27] day of
[2:08:29] salvation is that right today is a
[2:08:32] moment to make sure that we we have the
[2:08:35] Seal of the Holy Ghost that that's
[2:08:38] what's more important than anything else
[2:08:40] in this
[2:08:42] life but to see the confidence what I
[2:08:45] want you I think we've seen that and I I
[2:08:47] trust you honed in on that the
[2:08:48] confidence the prophet himself bringing
[2:08:51] that that word it was a confidence this
[2:08:53] word will bring the
[2:08:55] experience sometimes we our frustration
[2:08:59] can be when we try to start doing things
[2:09:01] in our own
[2:09:03] efforts you can get frustrated with
[2:09:05] family you can get frustrated but any
[2:09:07] time frustration it's never because of
[2:09:09] God's leading it's because of us looking
[2:09:12] at a promise and trying to say how can I
[2:09:15] make this come to pass but if we'll just
[2:09:17] trust the
[2:09:18] Lord pray and say God let my life be so
[2:09:22] salty let it be salty let me be like
[2:09:25] that little bear that got in that tent
[2:09:26] that just got so got got all that
[2:09:29] molasses all over him and and just just
[2:09:31] oozing out the Molasses having something
[2:09:34] like what brother George mentioned as
[2:09:35] well that others can look at and say man
[2:09:39] I want what they've got amen not because
[2:09:42] they can quote scriptures and they can
[2:09:44] quote but there's they got a Joy about
[2:09:46] their life there's something that's
[2:09:48] joyous
[2:09:50] amen that's a joy that God gives I tell
[2:09:53] you if you don't have that Joy if you
[2:09:55] don't have that this morning God's here
[2:09:57] to give that he's here to do that for
[2:09:59] you is here for you even in this moment
[2:10:01] to take a hold of that promise it might
[2:10:03] have seemed like it slipped out of your
[2:10:05] grasp but it's not beyond what God is
[2:10:09] able to do for your life just say Lord
[2:10:13] just like within this Lord make yourself
[2:10:16] known to me make yourself more real to
[2:10:19] me when brother Bram said the holy the
[2:10:21] Holy Spirit has showed us the promise of
[2:10:23] this hour just be that simple with God
[2:10:25] be that simple Lord just show me Lord
[2:10:28] the promise for this hour show me Lord
[2:10:31] what your will is for my life Lord and
[2:10:35] as we're getting into the word get into
[2:10:37] the word for those of those of us as
[2:10:39] we've been around it listen friends we
[2:10:42] need to get into the message more than
[2:10:44] ever we don't need to be listening less
[2:10:47] we need to be listening more well I I
[2:10:49] listen to so and so you we need to
[2:10:52] listen to the message of the hour we can
[2:10:55] get caught up and listening to so many
[2:10:57] other ministers all around and I
[2:10:59] appreciate good Ministry but let me just
[2:11:02] say this to you if we're not careful we
[2:11:04] begin quoting other preachers instead of
[2:11:07] quoting the prophet of
[2:11:09] God are you hearing me God gave one
[2:11:12] voice of authority in this
[2:11:15] hour amen if we're getting blessed then
[2:11:18] it's because they're tapping into the
[2:11:20] same source
[2:11:21] who gave it to the
[2:11:23] messenger you believe that if there's
[2:11:26] ever a time in an hour we need to really
[2:11:28] get into the message of the Hour really
[2:11:30] really dig in say God and just make it
[2:11:33] personal Lord make yourself more real to
[2:11:36] me Lord if you need the Holy Spirit Lord
[2:11:40] condition Lord my life let everything
[2:11:42] about me rot away until there's nothing
[2:11:45] left but a willingness of full surrender
[2:11:49] if you've got loved ones they're not
[2:11:51] here here you claim them I don't care
[2:11:54] what the situation looks like it doesn't
[2:11:57] matter what kind of a condition that
