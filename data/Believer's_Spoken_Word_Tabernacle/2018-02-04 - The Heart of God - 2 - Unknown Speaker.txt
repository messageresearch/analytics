Lord God upon the roads we pray Lord O God how we thank you Lord for your mercy this morning Lord we just give ourselves to you that you might have full preeminence this morning father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen you love the Lord matter if you want to turn to psalms 19 with me and just want to remind you of the fellowship dinner here at NORs ins depot following the service the address and everything is posted inside even in the restrooms there so on the announcement that's on the bulletin boards in each of the restrooms also remember brother George Smith Lord willing we'll be here with us this coming Thursday and Friday evening and that's if the weather holds out so you just be in prayer about that and want to say just so good here too here is mr. krest back here with us you know sometimes I it's happened to me before I was ministering on Thursday and I looked out on Thursday and I thought that sister Ana I'm making in my mind with she's not been here for a weekend she's been she's been gone did she did she do come back last week my mind inven in the midst of ministering I seen that but she just she just got back if she hadn't come back in time for the fellowship we would have send emergency escort if you don't know what that means well you can talk to me after I've been through the line you love him glory be to God Psalms 19 verse seven I want you just to these are familiar perhaps maybe too many very familiar places in the Word of God but I want you to notice how David and his were in the writing as the Spirit of God is leading David here the law of the Lord is perfect converting the soul the testimony of the Lord is sure making wise the simple the statue of the Lord are right rejoicing the heart the commandment of the Lord is pure enlightening the eye the fear of the Lord is clean enduring forever the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether more to be desired are they than gold yea than much fine gold now here is a man who is expressing from his heart how he truly feels about the law of God in an amazing that in this hour and throughout time that when we look at the law people can look at the law and say law who needs the law but here David is looking at the law but he's looking at it different than how others look at David his David is rejoicing David doesn't even see the fulfillment of where that the law of God would make it to to actually be inscribed upon our hearts but yet David himself is rejoicing what would David do in services like this you see what I'm saying well what would David do and he would dance all right that's the absolute truth he would definitely be dancing because he's rejoicing in the law of God right here Oh mine they're sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb moreover by them is thy servant warned and in keeping of them there is great reward now watch these next few verses who can understand his errors cleanse thou me from secret faults keep back by servant also from presumptuous meaning arrogant proudful sins let them not have dominion over me then shall I be upright and I shall be innocent from the great transgression so David understood that it was the true keeping of the law was not just that David could point to a letter and say I'm doing this but David said God don't let presumptuous sins have dominion over me don't let pride and arrogancy don't let it rule because if that rules then no matter what I can do by the letter I'm guilty I'm guilty let the words now here's there's the request let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight O Lord my strength and my amen may God bless you and bless as word as you're being seeded like to speak here can you hear just few moments on the heart of God you know when we we look back through the Scriptures we we always concede that there were always associated throughout the scriptures there were those who were of the elect of God who they were able by God's grace to be touched by the grace of God and be able to live out in that day and in that time and be able to catch what God was was trying to say in that time and we know that all the way down through the time god it was like a a great big puzzle if you were working pieces were continually coming together or we could say an unfolding that was taking place and we find that there were those when we looked at it in just narrowing this in here that a children of God who were able to by God's grace to not just live by a letter but they would live by the revelation of God himself and there was there were their lives if I can say it like this their lives were surrendered to a to the pulsation of God's heart it wasn't David that was register iting these words just because just to write words but David was writing these words that we read here this morning because it was a pulsation of an experience that he had with Almighty God and and this is really how David looked at it this is how David felt about it and here within within that it was a pulsation among the children of God within that hour that you know it was like that of where you take Moses Moses could hear the promise of God and and as his mother would talk of it but when it came time for that promise to be fulfilled that promise it's out there was a pulsation of life that moved into that promise and not just into the promise but it moved into Moses life to where that it was no longer a promise that was here that Moses knew about but now Moses had become one with that promise and so what was what was actually taking place it was the heart of God that was pulsating through Moses life what was it that would cause a man to lay himself down in the gap for many others it it was not a mere man it was Christ in the man what what is it that would that would drive where you would see this to where that this would be so taken by this and even Paul where Paul would speak of this in the book of Colossians and say I strive according to his working which worketh in me mightily and Paul would write of that even in the book of Ephesians letting him know that this is not my doing it's not my working but this is the very heart of God it's his pulsation that is beating out that's moving me it's what's giving me strength in the up times and the down times he keeps supplying me with strength it's life it's not us living out the promise it's Christ living the promise out through you and I that's the real reality of the heart of God and the real pulsation to where our lives are to be a heartbeat where God Himself reflecting and making himself known through our lives you find David David would many times David and many others that they would be so as they're surrendered to the Lord and they would actually speak things that was the very gripping in their hearts but yet it would be beyond their understanding and David would prophesy by the Spirit of God the heart of God would move down they would Paul say through David and it wouldn't begin to speak out my bones my bones they stare at me it is pulsating throughout his life even where in Psalms 40 where it would say that I have I've hid that word in my heart my delight I delight to do thy will O God and I delight with my whole heart all of those pulsations were from Almighty God and David was moved by the position of God to what was being spoken to his heart David would speak it right out and I believe that there is a people on earth right now that is moved by the pulsation of the Holy Spirit where it's not just a written word it's not just a word that's been prophetically spoken but it's a word that is being lived out it's a word that is taking its residency within the heart of the believer and that same word in the heart of faith it's here more powerful and more stronger than it ever is because in this day we have not ordained ourselves for this moment God ordained us for this moment it's God who has provided for us what we have need up to be able to stand in this hour it's God when the enemy wanted to tear down the standard it's down who has rose the standard out when they wanted to dispose of the Holy Ghost it's God who came on the scene and to prove to you and I that he steal every one of his promises are still yay and amen hallelujah amen these are not just statelessness as a reality to you and I that within these things are things that were to take into our hearts and meditate on and give ourselves to David new the Living God he knew God David had a delight we're mean you find David throughout the scripture speaking over and over with my whole heart Oh God you find David asking requests over and over in the scriptures quicken down me Lord quickened down me Lord quickened down me Lord you the profit in this day he didn't just preach of the quickening back in the in the early part of the ministry but he continued and even clear up to the very end delivered the sum of the last few requests in prayer was quick and us O Lord what is the quickening as we said last week the heart itself actually is in the natural is a separation from the central nervous system it actually has electrical impulses of its own and to think of this right here that the heart of God to think of Christ himself he does not need the energy from any man he supplies the energy he supplies the strength when Abraham said I don't know how it can be done he said nurse from me he drew Abraham white why do you draw the baby what is it that really calms the baby it's not so much doubt of the breast or the milk it's hearing the heartbeat it is hearing what it heard when it was in the womb and that's what brings strength to you and I know we don't remember it but it comes to a reality to you and I but I was in Christ before the foundation of the world I was ordained in the very heart of Almighty God and when the promise of God comes by in the salary and the Living God he reaches down to you and I and you say I don't know how I can do it I don't know how I can overcome this I don't know how I can get past this he says my child just surrender and he takes us up into his bosom what is his closer his bosom is the prophesied promise of the hour where he made himself alive and real where it's no longer just aware but it becomes a source of strength and nourishment that you can receive into your life what you have need of with Jesus and my words they are spirits and their life once she just says we look at this in the scripture and Isaiah 29 I I want to look here and take a journey into looking at how that prophecy itself had spoke regarding the condition that was that was going to be present when the Messiah would come there in Israel and we find that how that in the Book of Isaiah that even in verse 9 I'm just going to kind of move over some things here just to refer to it of how that the scripture would talk about that they are given to a strong drink they're given to a drink that would intoxicate them and it's an intoxication that would make them numb and not realize what is actually taking place he goes on to say how that God through that would pour out the spirit of slumber and here within those things here you know the intoxicating part leading to that of slumber but then how that the Lord how it would spoke in the scripture the result of this slumbering is where the Bible says in Isaiah 29 11 that the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed which men delivered to one that is learned saying read this I pray thee and he said I cannot for it is Selah and the book has delivered to him that is not learned saying read this I pray thee and he said I'm not learned so the book itself though having words the learned doesn't understand it but nothing I've learned doesn't understand it so it's a condition where we can understand this that God's desire is that you and I would understand that I want you just to hang on to that God's desire is that you and I would understand but he God does not come according to the understanding of man he does not work according to the intelligence or the wisdom of men but God himself he works in understanding that whereby his children his elect his subjects will understand and he knows just what to do the Bible says in verse 13 wherefore the Lord said for as much as his people draw near me with their mouths and with their lips do honor me but have removed their heart far from me they were so close to him but yet they were so far away so close yet so far it wasn't that they weren't saying the right things their heart their heart he never come to get their lips he come to get their heart their lips were not straight from him this their heart was straight from him you see God's not listen you the inside God gets the inside of the life right the outside will reflect what's on the inside is that right remember the the Pharisees and all of them remember they were saying you know in regarding to the Lord Jesus about how his disciples were they were eating with unwashen hands and and the Lord Jesus begins to bring it out to them that a man is not defiled from what he from what as he's taking that in but he said his defilement is from that which is already within him for out of the heart proceedeth and he began to go through from all those things where the word from the heart those things that go forth so is saying that the ministry listen to me now the Ministry of the Lord Jesus when he's coming here at the end of the ages to the to Israel it's a ministry that's to deal with the heart of the people of God and they are not even aware that their heart has drifted from God they don't know the condition they don't know what's needed but God knew the condition and God knows what they needed just like God knew that can in this age and he knows the condition this morning and he supplies what is needed to bring all things about to where his word my half recourse I'm glad about that I'm so glad about that and their fear notice they've removed their heart far from me notice they have removed it they did God didn't shove their heart away they removed it and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of man and he goes on to talk about of how I'm gonna proceed to do a marvellous work among this people even a marvelous work and a wonder for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid I want to just look at that for a moment when we when it says here in the scriptures in verse 13 their fear toward me is talk about the precept of a man the Bible says that the fear of the Lord is clean you see the fear of the Lord does not listen when it comes it is clean and it does not leave your dirty that's not the real fear of the Lord let me just deal with this a little bit the fear of the Lord does not leave you in a place to where you're operating under fear it brings reverence and reverence can only come by love God's desire is not that his children would operate under a spirit of fear because that's bondage God doesn't want anybody serving them because they have to he wants you an act to serve Him because we love him I mean you wouldn't want to marry somebody you don't want to marry right I know I know some of y'all understand you got some things about arranged marriages and whatever more but there's only one arranged marriage now I don't say that I don't believe in marriages cuz I don't want to offend anybody or any of my brothers that might be listening in other countries but I want to say it like this there's one arranged marriage that I do believe in this is where brother Samson never really let me have it very good this is where I do believe in one arranged marriage that it was already arranged before the foundation of the world been you and I would be united with Christ in this hour let me tell you something it's not something forceful we are drawn to it it is the very desire by heart what we've been longing for what we were looking for it was a thirst that the world could never satisfy but he came along and he put that feeling in our life it is a thirst quencher it was a rage deep in the meeting place where God would change your life it was divinely arranged Jacob there might have been of the church and might have been in the garage he might have been sitting in your car it might have been there but wherever it was it was pineal for you it was the face of God to you where God met you face to face glory be to God the truth here the truth here he comes by the presence of the Lord it's not generated by man or the knowledge of man but it's by his presence because when we see it that what happened God told them this is what was going to happen and we see this carrying forth in the Book of Isaiah to where it became just a generational thing they begin to hand down what had come from from generation to generation it was not a life it was a lifestyle there wasn't when you get asked why are you doing this I want you to catch this for a moment God let him know when they come out of Egypt before they ever come out after they come out he continued to tell him over and over tell your children understand not just do it tell them about it have a witness in your heart and express that to them they may not remember the words but the presence of the Lord that comes through what you're expressing they may not be able to understand it that's not what's important what's important is that the presence of the Lord is there and they know that the presence of the Lord is tied to his word hallelujah and that presence will bring them to that word to where it becomes something of fruit and understanding in their own life so the presence of the Lord is absolutely absolutely necessary otherwise it just becomes a generational thing becomes offering up with no sincerity whatsoever you say brother Samuel that can't happen around this message that attitude right there already as a product they thought it couldn't happen the moment you think that can't happen or happened to you is the very moment you are already backsliding we've got to walk daily with him this is where the profit would be very clear to us in the message Christ as the mystery of God revealed and he would tell us he said were not to make converts to Christianity by its government do we hold standards absolutely and we must hold the standards of the word absolutely he's not talking about you know not setting a standard well you know they're just my children they've got to have their own experience why would you send them back to Egypt you're in the wilderness don't take them back to Egypt get them on into the promise and no listen French listen to me you know it has to be God to do all of that I understand that there's many as we stand faithful you know it's not optimistic determined the times and where we can you know of a sudden place their births and all those things like that you understand what I'm saying but yeah I hope you through what I am saying that are just a complacent attitude that is just haphazard like well if there's this that's the way it'll be my question to you what if God had played with your salvation that way that's not a true committal a true committal is even in the midst of you where you're able to stand within that and say Lord I want to stand I want to show the standard and you know they may be out of your presence right now but you're saved by the Samuel if they're not even in my house how can I show it true standard by the loyalty of your heart the loyalty of your heart right now I want to be very clear with this here when God would even when we deal with these things you can't don't even allow yourself in this service to get back into a place when you say oh I made this flood I made this mistake listen receive God's grace and move on move on let's let's keep working on this is the thing right here don't just get down upon it but remember the presence of God is to recognize that within these things that even your contact with them whether you're texting them you're calling them you're spending time with them let me tell you something what wins the heart is not so much the words you say it's the life you live and the presence of the Lord the Bible says that when the Lord Jesus stood there and he spoke those words they men those people had had heard words and heard words but the Bible said never a man speak like this you want to know what was the difference the presence of the Lord was accompanying what was being said that's what's important it's easy we all make mistakes what I'll say a man for you that's not that's not a cop-out but we're not out of to make converts out of his government this message is not a government the gospel of Jesus Christ is not a government if that's the viewpoint it becomes a lifestyle you understand in the message baptism of the Holy Spirit the profits for you can have he say here you have the sisters with the long dresses and along here that said praise God but then he also deals deeper than just what you see on the outside he goes into the issues of the heart see it's deeper than what outward conformity that's that is not the role the role is bad on the inside and then the outside will reflect it you see when the desires when God deals with your heart by the word and you see something that's not right then immediately say Lord forgive me cleanse me Lord die to that thing right there tonight with the presence of the Lord that has revealed that because in that is liberty they had lost the fear of the Lord and what's this they lost the fear of the Lord because look the presence of the Living God look here Isaiah Isaiah prophet Isaiah comes into the temple he had already saw a man by the name of Uzziah this guy how the Bible said he was marvelously helped of the Lord but he got to a place - he got the thinking he did it all what was happening presumptuous sins he got to acting his door was something he did Isaiah saw this say God had to allow that to be removed amen and Isaiah comes into the presence of the Lord I said don't won the first time in the temple but this day was a different day he came into the temple that day and the post the pillars were moved the presence of God the train filled the temple the same one that Ezekiel saw the same one John saw in the Book of Revelations that same one was present there and his presence noticed his presence his presence caused Isaiah to say woe is me Isaiah had been reading the word but when it came and said well it's me a man of unclean lips God brought from his presence there came a confession and after there was a confession then the angel one of them went to the altar and took a live cold not a cold cold of a fire from the previous day but it was a live coal and is that if he put it upon my lips and this has purged and when that had come the Spirit of God spoke once again and said and let it be known the condition and the situation who go for me and Isaiah said here am I send me what was it that was the inner man on the inside here am I send me what was it the cloud and everything else was clouding over that inner man that inner man in the presence of God it recognizes who he is what he is ordained to do comes out just like the fruit upon Aaron's rod it makes itself known this is where the prophet and I want you just to think of this the Prophet would speak in the message rapture at the very first part of that message and he would speak to the people and say I've never been guilty of trying to say something to please the people encouraging the people and pleasing the people are two different things you say brother samba but we understand that but I think sometimes we don't understand that I think sometimes it is clouding to us because to please would mean to make happy but to encourage encourage is to encourage in what belongs to you this is where brother branham will pick up in the church age book in the Ephesian age and he picks up on the subheading praises his own brother m said we as pastors as ministers has husbands could learn a lot right here t taking the spiritual and application where it's not just a letter but it's to be a pulsation of life that it's not just saying it cherish but it pulsates out through us of how to run our homes he said to priests praise to encourage praise is not to please praises to lift up it's to encourage my guess we just need to take the separate service on that it's very important he says I've never been guilty of that but he said rather and I want you to listen to my desire is to say something that would further your experience with God if you're a Christian and if you're not a Christian make you ashamed of yourself then you will become a Christian so in a service the objective within the word coming forth is there to be a furtherance of experience and at the same time as that's being furthered on it's also through that same word to draw a life that is not a Christian to a place to be ashamed of themselves and say Lord I'm not who I need to be Lord and draw him unto Him I hope this doesn't stump you but let me tell you something God can bring souls to him and fill them with the Holy Ghost by preaching marriage and divorce the word is the word John three may not be a text that I read this morning but John three is always preached a life are you with me it's not just something that we wait for certain services but we're gonna have special services Friday nights gonna be this Saturday night we don't want forms God deals with hearts and lives it's him the word yes sir I believe that with all my heart this is the word in Matthew 13 and watch how the Lord Jesus speaks of this he's talking about in verse 14 for sake of time of how that this this prophecy of Isaiah is being fulfilled in them in verse 15 it says for this people's heart is waxed gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes they have closed lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their heart and should be converted and I should heal them this people's heart is waxed gross what's gross means to make thick to make fat or fat metaphor metaphorically to make stupid to render the soul dull or callous their heart this is what was even said in Isaiah 29 their heart was removed far from me what kind of heart is that a calloused heart a fat heart you with me you see when he made the statement they that here in the scriptures that less they should understand with their heart and should be converted and I should heal them here is the very first part it's the heart God comes to deal with the heart he wasn't looking at all their robes and all their accomplishments and all this he come to deal with their heart that's the same way I'm glad he does that yet this morning he doesn't look at all of our compliments oh they've been serving me here for let me see here 30 years oh there there okay no I always loved how the Prophet opens up in prayer and invisible Union naturally begins he begins to talk about different ones that's going on he said Oh God let the Great Holy Spirit come in here this morning and search on our hearts and Lord don't leave mine out don't leave mine out Lord Sutch mine too David said search me and try me Lord and see if there be any wicked way in me we might want nicer words but David put it out and need to be put yes sir now these people they didn't think they needed to be saved they just thought they were rapture ready they didn't know they needed to be saved they didn't know there had to come a change you see what they didn't know they didn't know they had been bitten by the serpent as well they didn't realize that your natural birth even though you might have come through and traced your stock back and said we're Abraham's seed but I want you to know that your great great great great great however mark back to Abraham he was still born in sin and shaped in iniquity he needed a redeemer he needed blood just like you need blood you see what even hid when he was tying them in and letting them know that your life is not pulsating with all of those that have gone before where they were pulsating in the promise uh pterence would come through them a further opening of the promise making clear to the elect God's ordained pathway they did not recognize that their greatest enemy was themselves they didn't see the greatest enemy was their first birth they didn't see that they looked at the greatest enemy get rid of these Romans get all these people away from me get all this away that was a flee compared to their first verse the other said a greater army could come in and expel the Romans a greater powerful army to come in and expel it but guess what if that victory don't last they needed a true victory day in their soul it was prophesied all the way down through the scriptures on salvation coming to Israel and Isaiah 52 even when the Spirit of God would speak through Isaiah and speak of how that Israel was brought into bondage yet they did not see themselves in bondage remember when the Lord Jesus here he was he's standing there and he lets some of them know who started to follow him he said if you continue in my word then you're my disciples indeed so there were some who started that really were not disciples indeed they were disciples but they never became indeed indeed meaning without pretense or false simulation it became true how by the word that was being made manifest pulsating would bring them into the promise of the person of truth himself he said the truth you shall know look what he says if you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free immediately when he said that they got angry this is a promise from the word I guarantee when they read that promise in the wire it didn't make him feel that way it didn't I never forget a brother one time you know he he went here too he went and went into a church a pastor and here he goes into a situation you have if you have a family a husband and a wife you know they're laying out of church and come back and in and out and everything else it goes to him and begins to talk to him about being you know and you know how the Prophet said when if the love of God's in your heart and the sister said that makes me mad and the brother said sister he said I'm only saying what the prophet said and this is what she said when he says that it doesn't bother me but when you say it it makes me mad I don't give the individuals name it's not hearsay you see see this is different when the white we're just reading it but when that word becomes flesh and the word is bringing a discernment to a situation in a life that's different we can listen to it on the tape we can read in the book so let me tell you something you need to be listening to the word if you're not giving yourself to the message you need to be feeding on the word you know it ought to be something that you crave and you desire and realize you know but say I need to do this and I need to read this book and I need to rape this book forgive me no don't forgive me let me be very clear put your devotionals aside and bury yourself in the message of the hour then devotionals are written by men that are moved by their intellect on the scripture let me tell you something we have we have received a message from God that is the scriptures hated it they may have you on a real devotional take out the token you want another devotional they got the exposition of the seven churches you want another devotion just once more Lord hello it may not tickle your ears but it'll stir yourself it'll give you a Dominion a Dominion in your life because this message may man is the issuing in of the kingdom of all my reward is the issuing end of the millennium that seventh piece that third peak he carries clear to the Continental Divide right now is a reflection of that ruling we're going to a millennium you see it's carrying us into a promises who Floridita college you love him these promises that were made known the Jubilee they knew these things they knew they could talk about him but they knew it is only a fourth they didn't know it as an application they looked i just want to place myself here they looked and they said or abraham seed we never been in bondage see any man he never been in bondage yeah we think our ancestors came out of Babylon we never been in bondage we were born right here Jesus said a whole mind well were they educated they knew about Moses they knew the writings of Moses but look what had happened their heart it wasn't the writings of Moses let me let me just drop this very clear it wasn't the law that did this it wasn't the law it wasn't the writings of Moses that did this it was their own hearts being moved away literally didn't start banging all of a sudden he started out little by little by little by a slight deviation started out small and here what you find when the Lord Jesus has come he's revealing if I can say it in tight what the horse riders have done he's revealing and uncovering Satan's working he's revealing demons in a religious realm he's addressing enticing spirits that are versing the Word of God when I speak in tongues in taxing spirits versing the Word of God if that is what you base on and it allows you to assert yourself above the word it's an enticing spirit well I believe brother ran was a prophet and you'd believe that and your life is not submissive and the life's not reflected that's an enticing spirit we don't want to be like them oh we're in the message bondage cannot come to us really right there is the attitude of bondage that's pride its pride our learning is not what makes us undeceive about we're ordained by God not to be deceived but within that our dependency is upon the Holy Ghost as the leader of the Church of the Living God he'll never lead us outside of the word a spirit that'll take it and try to lead it outside of the word I don't care if it's bearing quotes and then quotes take you East from West and it doesn't line up with the scripture it's a false spirit yes sir one little deviation from the truth the Spirit of Truth when he has come he leads and guides us into all truth he let him know you are you you that he said as a being whosoever committeth sin as a servant of sin he let him know the servant he's telling him their position where you are you're a servant right now you did survey your hearing no insight the servant abideth not in the house forever but the son abideth forever why the Sun bears the name of the father's house and he realizes I have come in my father's name who I see the house of God amen this was the house of God this was the promises that had been spoken now those promises were no longer just print but now they had become a place for one to dwell and becoming a place for one did well he's there to minister an entrance into that promise they listened they had no pulsation of fear within them they had no pulsation of real truth fear within them they run some how can you how could you say that because they so easily took from the Word of God and the Word of God has tampered with there's a problem with the heart it's a problem with the heart the Bible says it like this in Psalms 119 verse 69 the proud have forged a lie against me but I will keep that precepts with my whole heart their heart is as fat as grease but I delight in that their heart is this fat as grease the heart is this word fat means it's insensitive you know one of the things when you get to looking at probably some of you've looked at this already one of the things that their leading cardiologist right now have discovered years just some just some years back and they're putting it forth right now do you remember how many of us will maybe not many of us maybe there's a lot of us that were raised like this that saturated fat is the enemy right the truth of them the truth be known as they're bringing it out it wasn't that it's the carbohydrates that are the true enemy now that doesn't mean that you can go order your porterhouse and sit down with a carb filled potato there's a right way to do it now I'm not holding lessons on it either but if you'd like me but if you'd like to invite me over I can show you how to eat that steak I like mine fixed well done by the way with all the trimmings but they're finding that what it is that's clogging up the arteries is better than carb food you know all the foods that sometimes our body it actually craves almost like an addiction come on somebody tell me y'all getting quiet listen this is not doctrine it's not doctoral so don't go home and throw your cakes away and don't go into the depot and turning over the tables of sweets but this is why I look at this here that heart had become fat not from hearing the meat of the word the heart had become fattened by the sweetness of which it was presented it tickled the ears they had no fear in what they were saying of how they would take from the word and what did it do it produced its what people wanted to hear that's why the Bible says they have itching years in this day they will not stand still for sound doctrine is that right what had they done they had taken as the Prophet goes in and bringing this out and world's falling apart again I'll just just referring to some of those places they didn't think they needed to be saved and when they came here God gave them a baby that was a promise behold a virgin shall conceive this was not something that was obscure that was written in the word God had given them promises so that there was for that day but they did not see it it was a marian of joseph then when it became time for that promise to be fulfilled it started just kind of like he started Paul seeing through Marisa yeah the rabbi down there they said I don't move like he used to move Mary Joseph what does the Prophet mean when he said behold a virgin shall conceive the Prophet said Joseph looked her and said Mary that's too deep for me but one thing we know is it's God's Word and God's words can't fail he said that is the prophets words glory one no pride there I don't understand that never been done before but asked him after it happened ask him after happened he knew about it then lie they no longer was just writing it had become a pulsation for his life it became such a pulsation through Joseph's life till Joseph himself became one with the promise that had impregnated Mary and he said I'll be her shield I will be a shield for this word dwell in me hello children to be one of the horns on the lamb to be as protection the Lambs rights protected upon this earth how is it protected not by copyright it's protected by the indwelling of the Holy Ghost men have tried they've copyrighted this they've done this they've done that that has not protected it what has protected the real real reality of it the Holy Ghost dwelling in the hearts they thought they were saved they needed saving they had so excommunicated the Holy Ghost from the church in their day they took promises and they made traditions out of it you see within if I can say it like this because remember children are born by the presence of God God's presence is his word being revealed let me tell you something just because in their churches it was dead didn't mean that God was dead there was a man by the name of Simeon they fell on the Holy Ghost and he revealed to Simeon by the Spirit of God siming you're not going to die till you see the Lord's Christ it was a promise he was already Simeon I'm telling you unlike the rest ever they might have been reading the same promises that Simeon was reading but there was different there was electrical impulses going through simians life pulsations that was moving and that and pulsation moved through his life and his testimony was I'm not gonna die til I see the Lord's Christ here he was setting he went being went to every day he went there no doubt setting in the office every day all of a sudden one day the same voice that spoke to him stand on your feet Simeon send me a new because why the law the word was not just a letter he had a relationship of what was permitted and given in that hour just like we read of David and night Psalms and I team then he directed him right to the fulfillment of that promise you see within it how that the Lord Jesus himself here he was standing there and as we as we mentioned moments ago when he spoke about when they were confusing him of your your your your disciples their transgressing the tradition of the elders and the Lord Jesus himself said why do you transgress the commandments of God what's greater the elders or the commandments he asked them why are you transgressing I want you to catch this here the Lord Jesus refers to this this very thing where they have taken the word and instead of holding to the word honor father and mother a promise the commandment was promised that that day's might be long and they took that and they altered it to where that it was no longer the children looking there to the parents in honor but instead it was where the children were declaring to the parents I'm a gift to you that's your Bible right I'm a gift to you you see their teaching had so turned the order of headship around that teaching was a reflection of their life you with me that teaching reflected their life but they themselves believed that they could tell god what to do it's a gift whereby you might be profited why was that why would they have to alter it why would they have to change God's Word well the same reason that people have to change words now to let gays in the church and allow all this other stuff in the church you want to know why because they don't have the power of God to stand upon God's Word so they have to make compromises on the Word of God because they don't know the Living God we don't have to back down from what promise not one promise the same God that gave that word the same God listen to me that's how you and I but a stand on it we're the Prophet himself answers the questions and answers and he comes right around and he makes it clear in the token you're not have the same confidence for your children that God would deal with them and turn them around like the same God did it for you you didn't get yourself out of Egypt you didn't deliver yourself it was the power of God that came down by the blood of the Lamb in Redemption but what was that they didn't have faith in the word they didn't believe you know why cuz they didn't know God they knew the history of the god of Moses are you with me they made a tradition out of his life come on somebody but you see counting interested in traditions God's interested in his word coming to pass he'll walk right back for dishes God will never come and honor a tradition he honors his word is that right you see the Bible says that the righteousness of God is revealed from faith unto faith these people were seeking the righteousness of God but they weren't seeking it by faith they were seeking it by the works of the law they were reading the way hearing the word in their synagogues but it was a mixed but faith there wasn't children being born in those synagogues I'm talking the children of the promised the Lord Jesus identified you took a key and you shut the kingdom up and anybody that goes to make a step towards it you close it off what's he saying that they in themselves were hindering the children of the promise were not being born you said brother Samuel would John went on the scene yet for the Lord Jesus but remember that there were those who were waiting in expectation they might have been covered over with sin and everything else but they believe that when God would fulfill his word and God himself would make that word alive who takes a woman at the well you compare her life to one of those Pharisees life the prophets very clear on this you couldn't put a finger on that Pharisees life I didn't say it's hard I said his life Jesus looked at their heart and said you're nothing but hypocrites whoo glory be to God there was no sweet there that was straight meat it was uncovering what the rest of who was looking at it who MA Wow these religious cows and making long pretense in prayer and one of her but the presence of God was there says come here John let me show you something they're filled with the blood of the prophets he changed the wonderment of those men and showed what was behind their robes whoo the word was present discerning the heart is that right whoa but there was a little woman down there by the well and when he came talking to her she did act like the Pharisees she said widow whose Messiah cometh you see what she was God she might have been living in sin but there was just a little bit of a faint pulsation it was not enough brother Enoch to bring her to a new life but it was something to where she knew there's coming a change there's gonna be a change with Messias cometh and here she is at that moment and was a faint pulse at that very moment she was brought into the bosom of a promise and it became a pulsation in her life she went back into the city and told him come see a man no pride about her come see a man who told me all I ever done you you already know me but this guy knows all I moved away the clown she had a genesis beating out [Applause] hallelujah but here was the GMO pharisees genetically modified guys they had genetically modified they had tampered with the word and yet wanting the word to have an effect you can't control the effects of the word either you want him or you don't want him either you do or you don't there ain't no halfway they had made it nothing but tradition I tell you a tradition can never bring down the power of God I don't talk about blessings I'm talking about the power of God the Holy Spirit can pour out and blessings can be all over and people and that's why you can see and say we loose a man I see people dancing in the spirit here I seen it at this concert I seen how that connoisseur sure the Holy Spirit pouring out blessings but I ask you is it the power of God because the power of God generates a life it's one thing to be moved under blessings but it's another thing to be tied into the Dynamo the generating power of Almighty God where it's beating out beating out feeding out beating out let me tell you something that word becomes so real and as becoming so real in the bride of Jesus Christ to where the temple is not something outside she is marching to the tune of onward Christian soldiers it is because her heart is in tune with the promise what the composer has written the seventh angel director came and caught the inspiration of the composer Bible faith was lost but now that director is able to be surrendered in the hand of God and there's a symphony on earth that can be moved by divine action and they're finding their position in this greater Parliament and beating out the promises of God yes sir growing a god hallelujah maybe I'll run me later this evening I tell you this is so much I tell you what you think I act like this here and I'll get it back right this here serving or my husband Lord the Word of God just makes my heart bubble over his presence I love nothing more than his presence no wonder the Lord Jesus could say blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear for many prophets and righteous men have desired to see what you see what's he letting them know they solid in in in divine utterance but they didn't get to see it being fulfilled many of them honored those things and they didn't understand what they were saying spiritual food in due season he said those profits so lived in that word they became so wrapped in that word till the world and their word was the same hallelujah to where he said that even their thinking what was being spoken was against their own thinking and they didn't understand it notice John even John speaking out but he didn't understand even what he was saying it didn't mean that the word wouldn't be ineffective little room tent the third pulls here God is meeting personally with you inside of this little room meeting personally has the proper could say the one that is here with me he said it went and it left me and he went over that little room why because it was to that uniting time that was being pointed to he said I rejoice to hear the voice of the bridegroom what was the declaration to see a unity between the bride and Christ the problem is they weren't in love they weren't involved they were doing things and they weren't in love in that terrible gonna be terrible and isn't it terrible if what you're doing is only because you feel like you have to do it you don't have to live that kind of life there there's a liberating power to free you from that that that's not honoring God there's there's a power the power of God to liberate you that is God's love to work that it's a love affair because the Bible itself the Bible it's a supernatural book the prophets very clearly said you've fallen in love with him then he'll reveal fall in love with him first in your review and he gives always the illustration you remember when he was riding back and forth to him and meaty and meaty wood right you know I'm sitting here and they see that and he said because I love her I can read between the lines because what how does he mean I love her he loves her he doesn't have to to see and be there physically but he loves her he knows her nature yes he knows her character he knows her lights and he knows her dislikes that's the same way in love of farriers with the bride of Jesus Christ that's the same kind of love affair that God desires within a people remember when he came there among them and here they were as people in that time you know there's a book when they read the word he wasn't prophesy to him in one prophecy to him it was just letters of do this and don't do that and we ties on this and do this and we don't do that and we'd go to widows house and me long for our everything was just formality ceremonialism let me tell you friends if you think that net in your life and think that here that it can't become ceremonialism you're highly mistaken let me just say this to you don't don't don't don't freeze up on me now I'm not against you I'm trying to help you the things of this world all the cares of this world the things we will even the trials that we've been ministry on Thursday night sometimes those things want to come to try to deaden us to get us to a place to where we're just going through the motions we don't want to just go through the motions listen if you feel like you're just going through the motions God don't despise you but God's trying to let you know hey ask me restore unto me the joy of that salvation he's wants to help you said he said they were stiff-necked and uncircumcised in hearts and ears is that right they were uncircumcised remember the circumcision was to cut the fat away from the heart the dauntlessly in sensitiveness they had received this law by the disposition of angels this was not just Moses going up into the mount the hosts of the Lord were there he meant he received the disposition of the law by angels glory be to God we have received a message that was brought to us by angels any man those angels that turned his wig are you with me hey men it was not it was not the gas from a rocket no sir those angels the prophets said those telescopes on Mount Lemmon they caught the cloud coming in it came from the west to the east why it had to come for you and I but the angels were already there waiting on the prophet and after the visitation the prophet said they caught it coming in but they didn't catch it easy the world has heard about a message that has come but the message of sticks in the leaves there is a people that is ordained Baptist word to be caught up in a moment and a twinkling of an eye the world they'll be missing people all over the world and the world will never know about it what is it a rapturing message catch you away if that terminology is new to you let me just make it simple a rapturing message is that where Christ Himself comes into your life and completely ignites your soul on fire to where the world is completely dead and the pulsation of your life is Jesus Christ it's not church or Church entity or religion but he is your life and becomes the very theme of your life that's a raptured life when Jesus came to him yeah you know many times you know I have many times when Jesus came they want to kill him they sure did they sought to kill him but they couldn't get to him and went till his time was up there's nothing can touch you there's nothing can touch me until our time is up and as the Prophet is said so say I so say we my time is up my purpose is done I'm ready to go he told him he says you have not the love of God in your heart they didn't have the love of God in their heart no they were reading but they did not have his love say they weren't reading it as a love letter Jesus could tell him you've never heard his voice nor have you seen his shape the word was if I could say it in the right way well am I saying 1-dimensional the word was just like this but - David David was eaten on this word is sweeter than honey and the honeycomb you know David knew about eating honey and honeycomb hallelujah glory be to God they didn't know his shape didn't know his farm they didn't know his voice never forget a brother who's trying to make an illustration when that one he was preaching and he had he had two he had that the sister come up here you know him so the sister he'd had the sister you know call on somebody's name you know she you know call out a name and then eventually here call her husband's me they trying to make this work right the preacher woman and he answer husband he said I'm sorry I got it wrong he had the husband's what he had the husband's wife up here and he pointed to somebody this other sister and she said his name pointed his sister she said he's name and wife and the wife said his name and the brother said he said now which one he said I don't know he shoulda knew his wife's voice what brother got in trouble then I'm sure but Abraxas I don't see him physically yet but I hear his voice coming over the heels I hear you this is a time of Resurrection the turtle doubts are given forth she's aware of the seasons and the times she's aware of what to be looking for you see it's not just written words she sees nature nature is letting her know what is its pulsation glory be to God I know you have not the love of God in you hold mine you love him let me just let me just skip the Lord Jesus is working with the disciples and I wanted to show this we've seen here aware of people within themselves they had become hardened the scripture said the hearts went grouse and in other parts of the scripture who used the word term hard they had hardened their hearts the Lord Jesus you can read this letter later just let me refer to it in mark 6 and also mark 8 the Lord Jesus when there was a need for for when they came when he they were out on the ship the way mark records it around the boat remember the Lord Jesus had taken a rest and they're out there on the boat on this underst on the ship waves begin to come all the story and they hear he begins to come he knows where they're at and he walks across the water and as he comes across the water he comes to them and rumor they thought he was a spirit and they thought he was a spirit he lets it know be of good cheer it is I be not afraid and he spoke those words to them and he came into the boat and he could see they were still troubled and the Lord Jesus speaks it in this manner and he says why are your hearts hardened he's talking to the disciples hardened meaning they weren't understanding I want you to catch this this message is so perfect the Prophet says in the message of the seals I believe it's a third seal he said anybody can see it that wants to see it in Christ the mystery of God revealed he says oh not just to say that this is just for this group of people here but anybody who wants to see it so this is not a closed event it's open you want to Liberty it's being blasted oh you're right he says hard why are your hearts hardened then he comes over a chapter later and he's talking about he's talking to them about the remember when he talked about when he told him beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and he tells him that remember they start reasoning in their hearts because we didn't take any bread I wonder if there's that because we didn't take any bread see he's speaking on a spiritual level they're reasoning in a natural listen now he's in a spiritual level they're in a natural there's got to be someone there to bring them up where he is he's trying to bring them out of the level that they're in the level they're in it shows a hardening but yet he's there to tenderize for he makes here's what he does he refers them back to he said you don't you know said don't remember is that why he says your heart hardened he asked him that again don't you remember he said how many baskets how many fragments a bread did you take up twelve Lord how many on the other time when we fed the other five thousand five Lord what's he you say oh say me what does that have to do a hardening of what he's trying to get him to see that what they're looking for and what they have need of and what has been done is to build their faith to believe God for right now to lift them out of this realm to where they're not sensitive but to bring them into that realm where all things are possible so here he comes to do what bring them into that place this is why even look how he handles John the Baptist when John the Baptist remember go ask if he's he or do we look for another right he was offended and no stump you does it John was offended because things weren't happening the way he thought they ought to happen there's a lot of things that have happened and been happening in our life that we didn't think that was the way but it was happening anyhow you can't stop the word I wonder how many lives were Lord God at the end of this service Lord I really Lord I'm gonna give my life I really want the Holy Ghost before they even get on their seat they had it you say brother Samuel what's important is that they got it yes it will make manifest itself is that right so how did the Lord Jesus handle this here what do you say yeah give me give me some witnesses you go tell him what you've seen and heard you know what he had confidence that all they have to do is talk about the word that's being fulfilled it will break the scales around the eyes of John why John's already in contact with the pulsation he just needed a little quickening oh yeah that was like a defibrillator it gave John charge charge for what he can lay his head on the platter ha here were the disciple I know I'm closing Hakka skipped a lot but here he's walking on the road of Emmaus what's these hearts they come out no you a stranger here what does he say old fools slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have said concerning what did he do he took them into the world they were a part of that water so how are you going to bring that farm there to life how are you going to quicken that how are you going to bring that into place bring the word that is they are a part of that's why no other message will take an effect upon you it has to be the inspiration that has been prophesied for this hour and that's why the Ministry of the word is the prophecy of this hour that has been spoken now coming to flesh all orchestrated by the angel of the Lord to him be the glory aren't you glad aren't you glad then when our hearts would maybe get a little harder a little Callister little aren't you glad that the angel of the Lord will just draw right in here and what does he do he helps us he lifts us out of this realm into that realm hallelujah you and I would try to grab on the fence pour ourselves up to the fence I see an elephant in the ring pull ourselves back up but all when one stronger than us gets a hold he can lift us up and we see things the way way off to see it why he has hit me in his pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle upon this rock we stand lift it up to see those things we could not have sinned there but he came this rapturing message brings us in sin it brings us up from just walking around has just mere mortals we are mortal still we battle with this mortality we battle callousness we battle that hardness you say man but there's nothing that can defeat the purpose god never called us to a church life he wants our line not just bone of his bone flesh of his flesh life to reflect you know you see friends that's why the message it's not something that's been made to be different some of you that are new some of you that's been coming for a few years you've heard that term over and over and over but I'm saying this to you the message is the original message of Jesus Christ and his righteousness it's what had been lost now has been restored back to the Church of the Living God that life Satan has always been after the life you know why because he cannot stand before that life he can't these powers before that life God's life in you by the baptism of the Holy Ghost you are and I'm telling you this right now this morning we don't have to alter that promise he's still the same yesterday today and forever whatever you have need of friends I mean this with all my heart this is his word he has got everything covered David broke out in more Psalms 103 bless the Lord O my soul and all that is within me bless the Lord O my soul and forget not his benefits he's alarmed that he loved all that diseases he is the Lord that redeemeth thy life from destruction he crowd is my life with tender mercies bless the Lord O my soul and all that's within me I'll tell you this morning you don't have to set bound by any complex of fear you don't have to sit there and say I've tried and tried before this isn't about trying this is about saying Lord I'm standing on your word your presence has come here this morning and you have made that word that's what I ought to give you faith in the word not because I've read something out of the scripture not because I've just read it out of a message it's true that's all vindicated that is true we ought to have confidence in that but it's got to be the presence of God that makes it real to you to let you know this is for you I think how Elijah walked by Elijah that day Elijah walk right by Elijah he threw his mantle around Elijah he never said one word to him but you know what the mantle being thrown around him it had an effect on Elijah and already had started pulsating what did he do he began to follow Elijah Elijah said what are you doing he said I want a double portion it Elijah didn't know it but he was gonna be none I stood as profit in the room of Elijah he didn't know it when Elijah was off the scene but here he would be standing on the scene but what was it it's the same mantle of God it's the same Holy Ghost his same killer fire that moves around your heart that's a young person has an older person it's the mantle of Almighty God that moves around themselves I am yours to do what draws you unto himself what's the greatest thing we can do you say Lord I surrender I surrender I forsake all my thoughts and ideas I forsake everything Lord God Lord I want to cleave solely unto you what god let's pray Lord Jesus your God we wholeheartedly Lord stand here this morning Lord God were aware of our frailty aware of our mortality we're a letter O God the Lord without you we can do nothing lord I pray dear God then no matter how much cloud of doubt is Lord wanted to clutter any life I pray Lord God may the Sun just break upon them this morning not if there's one that does not know maybe they come and they sit here Lord under the minister of the word a Time Lord I don't know I don't know maybe one Lord that's been for WoW but Lord they really need that real Jesus that real heartfelt in their life a life than this that's live Lord Oh God I pray this morning Lord grant that desire grant that request if there's the Lord one here maybe Lord a trap that God has been set for it Lord they've been looking Lord for that way out of that trap I pray this morning God right now God by your presence Lord Jesus may you move down Lord God father may they Lord responding Lord to your call may they lift up Lord Lord God deliver me O Lord God save me the Lord like David could say according to that tender mercies of God I pray this morning God North Jesus each of our lives Lord we've stood here we've looked at this we see in the scriptures Lord we know by our in our lives in many examples Lord that it's so easy with the carers and everything of life sometimes Lord's illness was Lord that people have been through are going through times Lord it's it's financial things it's different Lord situations and complexities of life maybe things will order not where they want it to be in their marriage maybe Lord within their home sometimes the Lord door look there through those things Lord the enemy would want to take joy from their life bring them in a place Lord - where's they don't have that joy that they once had you've just Lord been very become Lord insensitive but they're desiring in their heart right now that Lord God that you would just circumcised remove away bring them Lord God back into that place nor I pray this morning that you would grant that request its you Lord God you bring us into those places like you did the disciples they didn't mean to be hardened not sure dear God they look here this morning but God there's not one of us Lord that would mean to be hardened sometimes Lord with the experiences and things of life things can happen god I pray may we not look too excuses but we look to you Lord as David said I lift up mine eyes unto the hills from whence cometh my help messengers came from those heels they came God with messages Lord to bring when the army was in battle they even knew about that the Lord even here this morning we lift our eyes up lord I pray God give strength give grace Lord for every heart in every life this morning Lord no matter what that need is this morning Lord you are still to hold the job you are still Jehovah Rapha you are Jehovah Siskin who Jehovah Shalom you are all things

was there but Joshua was given orders that the priests were to take that ARCT and when their feet were coming to the brim of that water the water passed why they were taking the word they were taken to work that had come a promise word and they were carrying it over their heart and the word being carried over the heart remember that's why the man in the time when they tried to take the ark but Wren tells us on a mechanical device he said they tried to pack the word on a mechanical device he said but the word wasn't made to be tactical of mechanical devices the word was made to be packed over the heart a man died because of that that was not bad intentions David didn't mean anything bad by that David didn't mean something bad to happen but David didn't have understanding you see what David got caught in he got caught in enthusiasm and he failed to go back to the word it's gotta be the word not not enthusiasm come back to the word and here they stood and when they packed that Ark it came back came into that place that resting place and then it could come back into Jerusalem there were priests that could carry that Ark they were carrying it over the heart they man the world was made to be carried by our heart not by mechanical ISM but by a life a heart that's beating out when they came to that promise they stood there the Jordans party I'll tell you this morning friends it's a truth no matter what you have need of take that word of problems just put it right over your heart and say Lord this promise is mine healing the Holy Ghost deliverance this problem I just put that
