gathered here this morning you are everything lord i pray o god as we give ourselves lord myself and this congregation together may you come lord in the power of your holy spirit just speak to our

every part of our lives we need you lord we just oh god just commit ourselves into your hands now in the name of jesus christ amen amen amen god bless you as you would turn in your bibles to zechariah 12. i want to say thank you we or my wife and i the the card and the different greetings that were love and greetings and love that were expressed and for that of our anniversary there yesterday and and i'm just so thankful to the lord 22 short years and it just seems just like yesterday and i just thank god because the lord the lord certainly has been so good to us he's so mindful of all of our needs so we just we want to thank god for that and thank god for each and every one of you we want to look here in the scriptures this morning and i'm just going to give a little precursor before i even start and we'll see where we get to uh this morning but i want you to look at this and we're just going to trust in in the spirit of god the spirit of truth to show and to bring that parallel of how that god is preparing to deal with israel and what the same god is doing in our midst right now we recognize that god cannot move back to israel until the bride has gone in rapture but all things are working it's all being set in order as a matter of fact brother branham you recall back in um um the mid 50s brother brahman says the angel of the lord is on earth tonight getting the 144 000 back there so the same god who was moving in those times and putting things in motion see god's working on all fronts at the same time and so i want to just look here in the scriptures and maybe just a little bit of a reading here but let's look here in verse 1. the burden of the word of the lord for israel saith the lord which stretcheth forth the heavens and layeth the foundation of the earth and formeth the spirit of man within him who is greater nobody you catch that no one is greater than him behold i will make jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about when they shall be in the siege both against judah and against jerusalem and in that day will i make jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people and all that burden themselves with it shall be cut to pieces though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it and that's what's going on there's a gathering i want you to think of this for a moment now all that was being gathered in the time of the lord jesus you had powers that were enemies with one another herod and and and and even uh my name the name slips my mind right now but the other ruling power that was there they hated one another but they were gathered together how were they gathered they were gathered in rejection of the word there's a uniting that's been going on are uniting against the word of god in this hour and who is it uniting yet holding scripture but it's uniting against christ and his bride the message that god has sent and remember the message is not a book it's not a tape the message is get under the blood christ in you that's the message did the message come not to blur our sight so we can't find the door but the message come to unfold the way. it comes so that was not blurred but we find we find a way so finding with sight we find clarity we find direction we find strength we find courage we find our position so this whole part here is working under that uh pale horse anointing it's gathering together there out of that fourth seal verse 4 in that day saith the lord i will smite every horse that's his power with astonishment and his rider with madness and i will open mine eyes upon the house of judah aren't you glad he's opened his eyes upon you amen we're not seeing through our own eyes we're not seeing through the eyes of of a church we're seeing through god's eyes amen we are looking at ourself through god's eyes and will smite every horse every power of the people with blindness and the governors of judah shall say in their heart the inhabitants of jerusalem shall be my strength in the lord of hosts their god in that day will i make the governors of judah like a hearth of fire among the wood and like a torch of fire in a sheaf and they shall devour all the people round about on the right hand and on the left and jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own place even in jerusalem and the lord also shall save the tents of judah first that the glory of the house of david and the glory of the inhabitants of jerusalem do not magnify themselves against judah verse 8 in that day shall the lord defend the inhabitants of jerusalem this is the scripture i just realized i want to just minister forth here this morning in that day shall the lord defend the inhabitants of jerusalem it's not you defending yourself it's god defending you as he will defend them it's god defending his word we want to be in his word we want to be in him i don't mean to keep you standing but i think of how when the six day war was going on and you had these syrian tanks that were bearing down upon israel and they were coming in against israel and here you had just a group just a few men soldiers were out there in the wilderness and all of a sudden these in the tanks begin to get out of the tanks they stop the tanks get out of the takes and they begin to take off and run you know why because what they saw backing up these little few soldiers it was the pillar of fire said this is the father of abraham and they ran not big from those men they ran because the supernatural god was there to back up his word they weren't even in position yet let me preach a little bit i got you standing you and i were not in position in our life but god said you can't touch them right now we weren't ready that's why a bullet couldn't take you you weren't ready god said it can't right there he was right there protecting our lives and this this this this partial portion of scripture so strikes my heart right here and he that is feeble among them at that day shall be as david and the house of david shall be as god as the angel of the lord before them and it shall come to pass in that day now notice how it breaks back in come to pass in that day in that time see all of this is working that i will seek to destroy all the nations that come against jerusalem remember the israel was dispersed that was all the way prophesied through the old testament they would be dispersed because of their rejection of the messiah but satan has wanted to try to snuff out the lives of israel satan's wanting to try to snuff out your life but god says because you've vaulted yourself above my people i'll gather you together satan doesn't even the the nations don't even recognize what's going on but god's getting it all together that's why god allows that white horse that that gathering together this is why that it's the conquering and god allows the conquering to take place through their religion that's why all of these movements feed in to that conquering spirit it all feeds into it every movement even the present moments all feed in to that same spirit it's moving together to bring them into that place and it's moving through the nations but while they're moving and uniting there's a people on earth that are uniting with our promise we are uniting with our promise we are headed to the rapture we are headed to the wedding supper we are headed to the millennium we are headed to the future home hallelujah glory be to god and i will pour notice this in verse 10 and i will pour upon the house of david and upon the inhabitants of jerusalem the spirit of grace and supplications and they shall look upon me whom they appear notice the visitation the outpouring of the holy ghost first makes them ready for his physical appearing the same parallel now the the token the holy ghost makes us ready for the rapture glory be to god hallelujah oh my we never started preaching yet and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced and they and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only son and shall be in bitterness for him as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn in that day verse 13 verse zechariah 13 1 in that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of david and to the inhabitants of jerusalem for sin and foreign cleanliness that fountain is open this morning to you and to me aren't you glad it's been opened men have tried to close it up but god says i opened this fountain he is our life glory where men wanted to seal it up he takes the seals off of himself and it shall come to pass in that day saith the lord of hosts that i will cut off the names of the idols out of the land and they shall no more be remembered and also i will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land how many know the word it cast out amen god bless you bless the reading of the word this morning you may be seated now i kept you standing now that time doesn't count against me oh don't you love the lord oh i just so appreciate the lord so appreciate his mercy amen i want to look here at a thought this morning if the lord will help us it just uh so inspired to my heart here the strength of my life paradox of his power the strength of my life paradox of his power we're living in a very unsettling time for the world all things is made known of those things of man and systems and institutions all those things and we understand it must pass away there's got to come forth a new administration because when man fell it brought death all of this had entered in sickness and on and on sin so we recognize that there everything that god has been unfolding in his great drama and we look at the time that we are living in right now to think of the scriptures of everything that god has laid in the scriptures the promise that god has made that only he alone can fulfill and that he himself is the way into the fulfillment of that word that god in this hour what all the prophets what all have waited upon we are standing on the threshold right now we are standing in a time it's a very uh a shaking time for the world but it's a very glorious hour to be a christian to be a believer to be posted as to what is actually taking place to have the discernment of the holy spirit in our lives to catch and to be able to look behind and see there are spirits trying to press and make their advancement but thanks be to god that god in the midst of that time god makes himself even more real now when we look at this in the gathering of heroes we're reading of how god will bring israel back because remember as they were as they rejected they rejected him but god in through the rejection remember now he comes to take unto him a gentile bride remember the scriptures the the the bible it is it is a complete book of redemption and to recognize that many that what god has spoken it's not it's not a historical book yet it bears history it bears the history of the same god working in the same way as he as he works even now and we recognize that it is a book of prophecy that of that in itself is something that it takes the holy spirit to come upon the word and make that a real to us as we look back into that of the life of joseph and to recognize that how joseph was rejected of his brethren but while he was there in egypt he arose in power and he took unto himself a gentile bride and was given the name zephaniah panea which is the revealer of the secret things and to find to recognize that there were conditions that god allowed to rise there throughout all of the world known world in that time god allowed it to rise so that israel the bible says the sons of israel so that they would come and they would hear that there's corn grain down in egypt because there was there's a hunger there's a desire to be satisfied let me just say this to you very clearly there's a longing in a heart that there's nothing of this world can satisfy you can try this you can try that you can try this you can try that it'll only leave you empty and in many cases scarred and in debt but there's only one thing that can really satisfy that fears that god has put on the inside of you and that is him alone coming to a church won't do it but getting to jesus that's what will satisfy that thirst it'll satisfy that hunger so here we find within this you know the prophet as he picks this up in looking at that of little benjamin because remember it was little benjamin that where joseph he said i want to see little benjamin but he didn't call it out remember he's speaking to them through an interpreter is that right what was that it's a sign of where we're at not only is a prophet a sign of impending judgment but remember the sign of the closure of god dealing with tongues going forth in the time of daniel it was tongues that were going forth it is a sign of a closure of the end of god dealing with the gentiles we are living in the in these last days in the message under that message that god premier promised there would be a finishing up of the mystery of god what is the mystery of god it's the baptism of the holy ghost inside of you [Applause] inducts us into the body of jesus christ it's god that has made up his body now how that remember they come into that place and how that this arrangement is made for little benjamin which little benjamin is a type of the 144 000 and this is where we recognize that the 144 000 they are elect but they're not the bride that's where jehovah witness got off that's not the bribe israel remember israel is saved as a nation god's dealing with the bride as an individual [Music] is that right to be baptized into the body of jesus christ but out of every tribe and how that god is assembling bringing them together there's been an assembling that's been going on god's been gathering them there in that place and making ready for this time and i want to just read this here to you where brother branham he picks this up and he's now speaking to to us he says where will the gentile church be while jesus is making himself known to his brethren remember that the bride of joseph with the two children were in the palace for joseph had commanded let everyone leave me put them all out from before me so the gentile bride was hidden in the palace of joseph where will the gentile church go in the rapture into the palace the bride will be taken off the earth she will be caught up before the great tribulation to meet her lord in the air i'd say glory be to god for three and one half years while the retributive wrath of god is poured out she will be in the great marriage supper of the lamb [Applause] the contrast thin is the same contrast now while the world is going insane we have found a place of safety we have found the place of peace while the world is trying to solve issues that can only be solved by the word yet this word has come and brought resolution in our hearts hallelujah well the world is going insane come on it's not just out there blah blah says insanity marching right down the church pew insanity glory be to god you have to thank god to have your right mind then will he return leaving his bride in his father's house so he slips away from the marriage supper of the lamb while he makes himself known to his brethren at this very moment the antichrist covenant that the jews have made with rome will be broken rome and her allies look how this is stated rome and her allies then send their troops rome doesn't even have an army so you think she has control of all of the armies who can make war with the beast is that the scripture who can make war notice roman her allies didn't send their troops to destroy all the god-fearing word abiding jews keep this parallel in mind when they are coming against the jews to destroy them the bible says i'm not going to read that this morning in revelation 11 when the two witnesses arise their ministry and the working of the holy ghost among the 144 000 will torment the world why because the world is not going to receive what god is doing sometimes you wonder why people rise up against you on the job it's not this it's spirits it's spirits recognizing who's behind you [Applause] see the parallel is is so is so clear behind notice think of this right now psalm 27 go host shouldn't come around about me yet i will not fear it's the same parallel god providing for you and i in this hour when there's all sorts of things death hunger pestilence come on now all of this is around but there's a place of safety in jesus christ [Applause] i could be in my mom and dad's house and i'm not going to be safe from that you've got to get in the father's house you've got to get under the blood you must be born again [Applause] but as they come against the city to destroy it there will appear in the heavens the sign of the coming of the son of man with his mighty armies to destroy them who have been destroying the earth so with the enemy repulsed jesus then comes and presents himself to the 144 000. look at this statement having seen his mighty acts of salvation they have come to know his power have you come to know his power then you're a candidate for the rapture you come to know his power you've seen his mighty acts of salvation in your life but also seeing his wounds and knowing that they had rejected him even to that moment causes them to cry out in the agony of terror and fear even as dear even as did their brethren of old when they stood before joseph being sore afraid that they should be killed but as joseph said don't be angry with yourselves it's all right god was in it all he did it to preserve life that sealed to them now that is open to you and i listen theologians men of history they understood these things are you with me the message of the hour did not just uncover this to where all of a sudden we're looking in the scriptures but the message of the hour is it is the holy spirit on earth to interpret that word and say this which was spoken for this hour for this time it is coming to pass and i am bringing it to past it makes us aware of the time the day the season we're living in that we might recognize our day and our message oh glory be to god even so will jesus speak peace and love to them now zechariah 12 8 where we were reading from in that day shall the lord defend the inhabitants of jerusalem and he that is feeble among them at that day shall be as david and the house of david shall be as god as the angel of the lord before them i want to draw your attention to this portion in the scripture he that is feeble shall be as david remember david was not seemingly the first choice even the flesh and the eyes of the prophet it went it went to even eli i think it was the the oldest son of jesse but god said see it wasn't that oh why did samuel go that way hey your eyes and my eyes and our thinking sometimes goes in the wrong direction but what's important is do you have the holy ghost and are you sensitive when he says uh-uh you keep going until he says uh-huh that's what's important the sons of god are led by the spirit of god it isn't sometimes that we don't get things wrong but we are led by the spirit of god we obey when he says we keep walking until he says uh-huh [Applause] oh glory be to god so remember israel they received their own king when they rejected not samuel the lord but they did reject samuel they rejected the lord because samuel had the word of the lord god gave them a king of their own choosing you see look god even here was saul and god here was a man that would fit what they were wanting and god gave them what they were wanting the carnal mind will always seek after carnal things that's why the carnal mind is enmity against god but remember is remember what saul did saul was self-willed saul when the pressure got great saul wanted to move over and take other positions he wanted to try to do and try to bring peace and try to bring all of that but saul wouldn't wait on god and remember that god rent the kingdom from saul he was still holding the title king but his power had already been removed from him [Applause] but the bible says when he go and saw samuel went to anoint david it said the strength of israel it was not david that was the strength of israel it is god who is the strength of israel it is not i or you who is strong it is god who is the strength of our lives this is why in psalms 27 the lord is my light my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is the strength of my life whom shall i be afraid even when david in psalm in second samuel 21 17 abishai the son of zaria secured him and smote the philistine and killed him then the men of david swearing to him saying thou shalt go no more out with us to battle that thou quench not the light of israel what was it god's light david was yielded god was manifesting himself as light to israel what does light do it gives leadership it shows paths oh my then the paths to victory was the strength of israel in their midst david relied upon what god had made him when david faced i know these are very very familiar places for us in the scripture but how fitting it is even for this hour when david faced each of his foes remember when it came to goliath who was uh the pinnacle or that of where he had had the bear and the land now here stood goliath that giant was there in the pathway but david said the same god he was not looking at lion bear giant no he said the same god amen oh brother and sister the enemy can come in many different forms but remember the same god sure the pressures the things that you and i go through now are greater than what it was when god first got a hold of our life but god has become greater those testimonies those experiences have prepared us for this moment that's why just sitting around in a messy church does not prepare you for this moment it doesn't prepare us for where we're at it's setting it's being seated in heavenly places in christ jesus it prepares us for this moment notice the bible in isaiah 40 29 he giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might he increaseth strength who does this he does it look even the youths shall faint and be weary and the young man shall utterly fall remember young men are strong in the book of ecclesiastes lamentations and over in first charm young men you are strong there is a natural strength in your youth a stamina that you have but the scripture is letting it be known that even youthful stamina even strength i'm not gonna do this and i'm gonna abstain from this and i'm not gonna do that that in itself will fail you need a greater strength and you can't give yourself that strength that strength comes from the lord that's why jesus said you must be endued with power from on high you can't face the spirits and the devils that are around about this day you can't live a victorious life you can't walk pleasing to god without the power of the holy ghost in your life this ain't about being good message young people and good man i thank god for things where morality and things were there would keep themselves but i'm telling you right now it takes more than good clean morality it takes more than just acknowledging that the word is true you must be filled with the power of almighty god that gives strength to your life stop trying to figure it out and just give yourself to it god is not known by the intellect well when i figure it out it's not an honest set your mind to the word that's coming forth and say god i give myself to you but they that wait upon the lord [Music] shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as eagles you you have something to catch you away you give yourself to something that's able to pick you up from darkness and put you into the kingdom of light glory be to god hallelujah amen they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint in daniel chapter 12 verse 1 the scripture is speaking of the gathering there of israel other places in the scripture jacob's trouble and at that time shall michael stand up the great prince christ in angelic form which standeth for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble talking about the tribulation such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time so the heightenedness the pressure everything that comes to a gathering around jerusalem and at that time thy people shall be delivered every one that shall be found written in the book oh there is power and glory to see your name in the book that's how you fight this greatest ball ever fought hallelujah inspiration being poured out see for for israel and if some of these terms you know don't don't get lost in the terms but i'm going to mention these things here when the bride how the bride has been caught away in rapture you have the two witnesses of revelations 11 they come and they have power to open that sixth seal they open up that sixth seal very interesting the heading listen the heading of the sixth seal in the scofield bible says anarchy incredible huh because you'll find the the insanity and the chaos that'll be going on on earth but yet among the 144 000 they'll be getting their right mind while the pressure is going on and remember it does not make men soft in that hour the bible says they become angry they are angered at what's going on because remember when the bride goes up the devil comes down whoa unto the inhabitants of the earth then is not just a demon holding the place for it in the man of sin but the devil himself comes down and then it becomes the beast whoa unto the inhabitants of the earth then my i'm glad that there's already a place of safety right now i i'm glad we found we found that place of safety in the ark that god has provided in this hour aren't you thankful oh my you see that inspiration that will be poured out that anointing of the word remember as we read here in a in that part of our text where god himself will pour upon the house of david the spirit of grace and supplication the spirit of grace through the preaching of those two witnesses what will they be preaching the same message that i'm preaching now the baptism of the holy ghost they will be calling them to that fountain that is opened in the house of david think about this brother branham was getting ready to go to israel is that right but the spirit of the lord stopped him and says don't go because why if the jews had saw that sign of the messiah it would have turned them right there but god's got a timing and everything has to be in order sometimes our look at it's not our thoughts his thoughts are higher than ours his ways are higher than ours god's getting everything in position with your loved ones come on now he's getting everything in position god is at work he's getting everything in position in his pride he's getting israel in position the nations are coming together even those that don't even agree the darkness is joining them together you think you thought you'd never see certain things in churches you thought you'd never see certain things where they would condone and or and and go what is it it's darkness darkness that is pushing in causing them to unite together but shalom shalom to the bride of jesus christ [Applause] hallelujah you see what god is doing remember what god is doing in the heaven there is there is a word as we read here in daniel 12 there is a word that god is revealing through that word israel's names will be called those that are found written in the book their names will be called what god is doing in the heavens is reflected on the earth if the hand moves this way it's reflected on earth because the shadow is the reflection of that hand moving this is why i think this should be a very uh uh point here when michael the great prince here is christ standing let me just say this to you there had to be a word that would stand for who we were that would call us from where we were to where we need to be there was a voice there was a life that god called him was it was directed in the scripture that then god himself could make known in his work you and i would have never had the confidence we would not even have the faith but god himself standing in his word he has stood for us and he made known to you and i before the foundation of the world you were in my mind he stood for us and now that he has stood for us we are standing for him in him standing fast in the liberty having done all to stand stand therefore quit you like men stand the time to stand this is an hour that says if you stand on what you believe will cancel you that is the spirit of the beast if you don't go along with our ways you don't go along with us thinking you don't go along we're not going along with the world's thinking [Applause] we've received the mind of christ oh brother the old life has been cancelled and the new life the new life has arose [Applause] we're not under the march in the leadership of this sorcery come on friends we're not bewitched we know in whom we have believed and we are persuaded that he is able to keep that which i've committed against that day [Music] it's a spirits that's at work spirits to do what besieged and wanting to close up church doors spirits congealing that's one to shut you up if you don't stand for us we'll remove you from your job that's a spirit of death that if you're near you if you don't stand with it then you cannot buy or sell. you understand your spirits at work the spirits have been released from the river euphrates i'm speaking to you this morning under the spirit of almighty god it's imperative it's important in your life that you be filled with the holy ghost it's important in your life that you have spiritual discernment jacob jacob was called back to the homeland how did he how did he get back to the homeland god calls the countenance of his father-in-law to turn against him is that right his countenance turned against him and jacob said to his to that of his wife it's time to get back but you see there was a promise that jacob had to get back to lord if you bless me in the land whether i go i will come back and give you the tithe god wants the tithe of our life our soul that belongs to him you give him the tithe oh he says and i will run your cup over sorry ain't talking about mansions and mercedes benz he's talking about real life and real peace and real joy [Applause] jacob wrestled with the angel where he had to get back to bethel first he didn't wrestle with the angel where he was at in the other countries come on he had to get back to the appointed place and god was bringing jacob back that's why the tender hand of jehovah has brought back the jews to this place this is why sometimes we can look and you can say oh my loved ones oh i don't want to see this and i don't want to see that but perhaps it's the tender hand of jehovah for god knows how our makeup is and how each and every one of us and god says i know what i have to bring them to until they themselves will surrender their own will what is it the tender hand of jehovah [Applause] hallelujah i say how great is our god jacob had to come face something that he had ran from he couldn't go back there he was running from it but god in order to prepare him to face esau he had to first meet god before israel can stand against the besiegement of all the armies they first have to meet god face to face in the power of his spirit amen are you with me before you and i can stand against the wiles of the devil we must meet god face to face when you meet god face to face then you're able to stand there when friends face esau and you're not fearful you're not scared but you receive the courage that has called out the very israel that's on the inside of you that's what god spoke of in his word that's who he made the covenant with not this this [Applause] [Music] no wonder in the prophecy the call will be that it's a calling going in the word going through israel like it is in isaiah 51 awake awake oh arm of the lord in thy strength has window parted the red sea the same power you see israel how did they get to this place they left him at the pentecostal feast god had the feast of the lord leviticus 23 the feast of the lord those feasts were to be completed in one year which speaks of the unfolding of redemption through the work of one sacrificial offering the lord jesus christ he is our passover he is our unleavened bread he is our pentecost he is our atonement he is our feast of tabernacles all of those speaks of the messiah himself but they left him at the pentecostal feast so how do you get what is pentecost what is pentecost it's jubilee what's jubilee it's to return back to your rightful inheritance if land has been sold and taken from you you'll go as a slave but the land belongs to you that's why you've got to write when the holy ghost he makes you aware of your rights don't you let the devil try to put it down like well you'll never do this you'll never do all you've got to do is let go and say i come lord take me to the holy ghost take me to my healing take me to my deliverance cause you've heard the call of what belongs to you [Applause] this land belongs to me hallelujah but in order to get to that of the pentecostal feast they've got to come to the passover the passover the offering on the cross but you see what has what has already been and god has been pouring out his spirit among the gentiles then comes the feast of atonement to where in the atonement it's not the killing of the lamb that is emphasized it points back to what was done as the passover lamb and that's what the ministry of moses and elijah does it points back to what was already done brother and sister that's why the message that god has sent in this hour what does it do it points us back to what god has done it doesn't point us back to a church doctrine that leaves people in sin and bound and hoping but it brings a real faith this is what the revealing of the true atonement does to the believer then you come to recognize he was bruised from my iniquity the chastisement of my peace was upon him and by his stripes i am healed everyone says one thing what does it do it leads you here the word as the word is becoming open and you're seeing it takes you in to the feast of pentecost takes them into a place where they unite with his life takes them back israel comes back into a place of the prophecy where clark said i will bring her back home this word reunites you and i to our homeland our homeland of the holy ghost that's why listen to me now don't despise where you say well i started in this church i started in a lutheran church or i started don't despise that you had to start somewhere but the thing of it is is that that couldn't satisfy because you want to know why that was not your home and they're talking about a building i'm talking about the world you received a call and you can't even figure out why these are good people here this is good this is fine my they have everything around they're good people but yet there was a call there was something more that you were longing for and you couldn't even explain it what was that it was god drawing you to himself [Music] i'm telling you it's a paradox of god's power [Applause] hallelujah zechariah 10 verse 1. ask you of the lord rain in the time of the latter rain so the lord shall make bright clouds and give showers of rain to everyone grass life in the field for the idols look at this in verse two for the idols have spoken vanity and the diviners have seen a lie and have told false dreams that's why the spirits that even arise right in this hour false prophets peace peace this is gonna turn around this is gonna turn around that's the bible when they begin to say peace and safety then cometh sudden destruction there's only one voice that can really speak safety and peace and that is the voice of god the blood speaks and says i am your safety i am your peace lord that a heavy laden come unto me and i will give you sadly oath for your souls look at this they comfort in vain therefore they went their way as a flock they were troubled because there was no shepherd you see what the revealed word by the spirit does it brings you under leadership we are without a shepherd but he gives us himself the spirit of truth to lead and guide us we're not walking by the fables and cunning eyes of man's uh um ideas this is not vain this is not vain comfort that pats you on the back and never deals with your heart you can be a good moral person and your soul filled with envy strife filled with sin brother let me tell you something this is why with many people you know you talk to them sometime and they'll say well brother samuel i bought a bible i started reading or i prayed with so and so stop the religious acts and say god i want to give you my heart [Applause] the religious acts only appease for a certain time god wants your heart you can't worship him any other way it must be in spirit and in truth that's why you struggle with your dress you go for so long and then you're back to putting pants on you're back to cutting your hair you're batman you're back to looking at things that you'll not be looking at all these other things like you know it is you need to get your heart clean you say what is this in order to stand the beseechment you've got to come to the fountain the fountain that's open to take care of your sin the fountain that's open the spirit of grace poured out that then causes you supplications to ask for what the spirit is telling you to ask for it's a serious hour it's a serious hour i'm not here to scare you but this might be your last time but this is a serious hour but it's an hour to have great delight and joy as a believer mine anger verse 3 was kindled against the shepherds and i punished the goats what do the goats do they prepare for the slaughter goats lead the people to the slaughter just like men leading their congregations into the tribulation come on and leading them to to the slaughter even to places of oh god don't care as long as you love the lord as long as you love god god don't care if god's love is that weak but i know better because where his love found me it took the love of the world out of man the desires and the appetite of that beast nature it could never extinguish but the love of god came and overthrew satan's kingdom here aren't you glad we're serving the living god and if you're not i pray that it will draw you to such a place to say i want to walk in that victory i hope it's not making you angry like it will be when the 144 000 are getting their visitation and the the people of the earth they're being angered they're being further made angry for the lord of hosts have visited his flock the house of judah judah and hath made them as his goodly horse in the battle see there's got to be a purging a purging the fountain opened in the house of david a cleansing it means you look at the jews they've been going back they've been going back into their land they um where they send them a ticket they want to come back you get a ticket all your family and you can move there but the way that that's paid for is because you already had ancestors you're tied into genealogy and you can go there on what they call uh aliyah you it's what it is it's a one-way voyage aren't you glad when the holy ghost got a hold of you it's not a two-way it's a one-way pop-up not going back no more no more i'm going on i been caught on the wings of an eagle but as they come in there no i don't know i these things i love as we study when looking at this you see them coming in there they're all painted up shorts on the women wearing pants and they do all these things that you look at but listen let me just say this let me be very clear it's more than just even the clothing on the outside it's their heart that needs to be turned you can have all the right attire on according to the word but if you don't get the wedding garment on your soul you missed it you have got to get the clothing of that garment of humility on your soul and then you're willing to have whatever the word has said god i want to please you but you see why there has to be a cleansing god cannot come and make himself known to israel they can say well my grandfather no they got to prove that they even have to learn they learn the language when they come in they're provided housing provided money they can go stay there and they begin to learn the hebrew language if they need to know it and all those things but you recognize there will be many of them that know all of that but miss their day of visitation but yet some of them have to be there because who knows it might be their children their son their daughter that's part of the elect 144 000. sometimes you can't understand why so-and-so witnessed to me they're no longer around but god only allowed that to be a carrier to get to you preach brother samuel why because the word will find its mark that's why brother random told us in power transformation he said you might look and say my this preacher i sat under they went off he said it wasn't a preacher that transformed you it's the word that transforms you [Applause] hallelujah glory be to god in the highest there's got to be a purging in order for him to come and reveal himself zechariah 10 4 out of him came forth the corner out of him comes forth the cornerstone the foundation stone out of him comes forth the corner out of him the nail out of him the battle bow out of him every oppressor together listen to this the message the contest this great contest has been going on for many years it started in heaven and satan was kicked out into the earth and then he became an enemy to god's people and since then he's used all his strength and his strategy to try to pull god's people across the fires or into his fires and we know that who has the most power god does and god when he gave his people the best thing that he could to combat satan with was his word now because the word is god and who's stronger than god so the word is god and the word becomes our strength god in the church becomes its strength to pull satan to his own fires that he has made the word in the church gathers satan pulls him to his own fires it makes you look at testing trials a little different to recognize it's god is ordering all of these parts and through the tester trial god is molding and making and shaping our lives and the word is having preeminence we're in a place and sometimes the lord i don't lord i i don't know i don't i don't know what to do lord i lord god i'm just lord how are you so helpless and he that is feeble shall be as david he that is weak out of weakness made strong as paul said when i am weak then am i strong are you okay and they shall be as a mighty men verse 5 which tread down their enemies notice as they shall be as mighty men what makes a mighty man you and god you and god are in the majority oh think of israel all the nations around about even now even now israel as a nation they are surrounded people constantly they are they are always the source of diplomacy and men want them to make peace packs we'll give them this much land give him this much land when have you ever made peace with the devil and he let you alone you give him this much of your life he wants more come on now you give him sunday and say well you know i just i do this on sunday he wants thursday then he wants this day then he wants that day then he wants this way satan wants the land you can't make peace packs with the devil but god says i want it all but when god as god takes it all that's real peace then he gives us real might and real strength notice what he does they shall be as mighty men which tread down their enemies in the mire of the streets in the battle and they shall fight because the lord is with them and the riders on horses shall be confounded and i will strengthen the house of judah and i will save the house of joseph and i will bring them again to place them for i have mercy upon them and they shall be as though i had not cast them out for i am the lord their god and will hear them i said that's a paradox right there that's a paradox to where you're no longer living tied to your past to where you're no longer allowing the enemy to bring your past over your head yeah but you did this and you did that there had to come a loosening that you recognized that was not that's not who i am who i am is who he has revealed and made me to be by his quickening power that causes you to rise in the power of his might as a mighty man and the devil says you are you already fellow you're a you're a small little guy oh it's not the size of the dog in the fight it's the size of the fight in the dog glory be to god in the highest don't you love him and they of ephraim shall be like a mighty man and their heart shall rejoice as through wine yea their children shall see it and be glad and their heart shall rejoice in the lord i'm just going to stop there i don't want to i don't want to lose this it's very hard but i won't let me just let me just tie this part up here verse seven let me read that again and day of ephraim shall be like a mighty man and their heart shall rejoice as through wine what does wine do wine stimulate oh you get people that are on the job around about you and they're drinking water at the cooler but they're talking about what they're going to drink that night i can't wait you know why because that drink has a way of dulling their senses and you know what they start acting in ways that they normally wouldn't act somebody who's real quiet like a mouth they become real vocal it starts affecting the way that they walk you know everybody they love everybody what does that wine strong drink listen to me now their strong drink that's poured out even upon the world where that strong drink upon the world is causing them to unite and to sanction things they don't even themselves perhaps believe in what is it strong drink this is why the scripture said the the devil is like is like he's like a roaring lion seems like he got a voice yeah he's as a roaring lion but look real close he has no teeth [Applause] hallelujah seeking whom he may devour but the scripture says be sober be sober be sober do not be caught up with the drunkenness of the world do not let them pass around their drink to you and you now start drinking it and start posting on everything else in the world going on preach brother samuel i will don't take their drink you know what that drink does it incites the passions of man you read in the scripture in the book of proverbs the those who were of the the the harlots and the woman they gave a mixture of drink to the man before he came to them you know why because it was not so much the woman that they remember but it was the drink that was given them that would separate them from all the women this is why the devil has poured out his concoction his drink his religion it's a religion of you can do so much this or so much that and you can still be all right that's the devil's religion but when you get ahold of the wine of god brother it inoculates you this is not something you need to take tylenol for in the morning it inoculates you it changes your walk not just for the night but it changes your walk from there forth because you recognize why is that guy acting different you must make him sleep in a different house than the rest of them nope you must feed him a little better no what makes this guy different aha he knows his father is a king in another land and so if his father is a king that means he's the son of a king though a king in a distant land he reflects the kingdom that his genealogy is tied to he reflects the bloodline that he is offered he reflects that of the kingdom that he is born from this wine it causes you to rejoice while the rest of the world is you know if they got fingernails left they biting them off and maybe the toenails too and everything oh man what am i going to do oh my goodness oh my goodness are we going to go back oh my goodness are they going to send us back to school oh my goodness are they going to send it back to job oh my goodness oh my goodness oh my goodness woman of shima what do you say oh is well and her son is still laying dead but she got to her absolute the absolute of the word in that hour and she said all is well as the bride of jesus christ that has thus saith the lord the wine of god salvation the wine of the holy ghost we can say all is well the devil can say you don't know what you're facing you got this problem this sickness and this but we can say i've arrived i've arrived to everything that i have need of he is my old sufficiency he is my holy ghost he is my deliverer he is my healer he is my rapture he is my all in all and they that are feeble shall be as david what in the world have you been drinking you want a drink this fountain ain't only good for bathing for your soul it's good for drinking got some real fine water yeah it'll put the spiritual electrolytes back in your life where you've been feeling a little bit of down it'll put some spiritual potassium back in your life amen when you've been when the devil been trying to pour it on what does drinking this wine do it makes you forget who you think you are and makes you realize who you are [Applause] man i'm telling you what it's like that guy his faith is rising you know why check what he's been drinking because faith causes you to walk up to a complete stranger [Music] hi how you doing the day's good isn't it what does that mean what you've been drinking make sure you're not drinking kool-aid make sure you're not drinking worldly kool-aid and got a stain on your mouth make sure you're drinking the wine of revelation in this hour are you with me because you drink what they have it makes you act like they have it stirs up vexation in your life what is motivating them but when you drink the wine of divine revelation brother it puts peace in your life it causes somebody would spit in your face and say i don't want nothing to do with you and this and that you can say you know what like brother jerry said don't feel it with you but i got for you but you'll pray for that man's soul won't you because why it's that love that's on the inside brother that's what the stimulation of the word is why because the meat shall inherit the earth that's the promise in the word the meek shall inherit the earth i'm telling you this morning in the name of jesus christ him if you haven't drank that wine this morning you say god inoculate my soul inoculate my life pack me away lord into your presence so was the enemy's advancement his encroachment wants to come they that are feeble shall be as david david maybe about this high i don't know how high how high he was but i know how big god was in him god was so big in him he had the preeminence in his life he that is feeble shall be as david this is the power of the revealed word by the spirit in our lives what do you say i say drink up i'm telling you drink up drink drink drink you love him hallelujah musicians come please oh blessed be the name of the lord it's a paradox of god's power the paradox is not something you can explain you can't explain it but what you know is when you pass from death unto life when you've been born again there's a change of nature on the inside this is what david listen to me this is what david said though a host should encamp round about me but in this will i be confident one thing have i desired that i may dwell in the house of the lord forever where was his victory in his desire look what your desire is look what your desire is within your life i'm talking about the desire that has rose up within your life if there's a desire in right now you say lord i want to climb into that place i want to move this god put that desire there let him take that desire i can't do it nobody else here can do it but he's the one who put it in you let him lift that desire to where it becomes a desire that's expressed through your life in a daily walk oh glory be to god isn't he wonderful just such a sweet sweet sweet spirit oh this fountain that's open oh what a what a glorious glorious day we're living in i say don't fear little flock it's the father's good will to give you the kingdom that doesn't mean we go out we act arrogantly no no no no no the spirit of christ won't do that in my heart these things i feel sorry for the way i see individuals acting there's hearts that are crying out you know what they're crying out for they're crying out for liberty they're crying out for freedom but there's only one place of liberty one place of freedom that's the spirit of the lord where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty that's real freedom it loosens you from your desire and brings that desire to serve god into a reality and then you walk you walk in liberty you're not worried about what's going on around you they look at you and say hey what's wrong you're not trouble hey how come you're not doing and you recognize i'm out of this world i'm not of this world what are what are you living for what are you doing well i'm living for that world that is to come i've already been touched by his life [Music] glory be to god maybe this morning you're sitting here you feel a little weak he said well samuel i'm just i tell you i just feel the pressures i feel it i feel pressure all around me let me i know i had to stop but let me encourage you they that be feeble shall be as david what must i do go down to the water brook david go pick up some stones that you know see what do you mean with stones i know but the holy spirit spoke two weeks ago brother jerry standing right here knowing who you are and the spirit of god would speak right and says you can't reason go back to what you know you know what god did for you and in your life go back down to the water book pick up those stones that god has laid out for you god knew that giant god knew that pressure he knew these things would be around but remember they that be feeble shall be as david fighting like mighty men because why the lord is with me rejoicing yeah why because we are taking in of his word that revelation just something about it but david it just it has a way it packs us above the clouds of gloom it packs us not me not you if brother joy was to call me he didn't brother joy but it might be something god places upon his heart maybe a text or something it isn't it isn't the man but how that god will come through and lift us it's god lifting us so i say this morning you feel weak don't despise that this is when he's made strong he's prepared the work in your life for this moment the test the trial that you're going through as far as the mind it's beyond there's no way but these are the places that god brings us to this is why the scripture says let the weak say i am strong i will be strong no no no no he's the high priest of your confession i am strong i can do all things through christ who strengtheneth me hallelujah let's pray anybody want to be remembered in prayer this morning god knows your heart he knows what's behind your hand god bless you god bless your hands heavenly father we're just i i don't know lord what to say but just to say that we love you we love you lord we appreciate you we thank you lord for your correction that you give us we thank you lord for speaking to us if we've got out of step in any way you call us back instead we thank you for your grace through every test and every trial we thank you lord god for what you've done in our lives and what you're doing we thank you lord for the souls that you have saved and we thank you lord that even now you're dealing with our loved ones we thank you o god the lord you're mindful that you administer to our hearts that our eyes might be turned away lord it's not always comfortable to see our feebleness but it's when we can recognize our weakness and then to recognize the greatness of god that weakness is what invites your greatness your power your strength so father behind these hands there are needs there's hearts you know what that need is lord and i ask god that you would grant to him the very request and the desires of their heart lord we ask these things now in the name of jesus christ amen amen if you'd like to stand you're more welcome to go ahead brother brian lead
