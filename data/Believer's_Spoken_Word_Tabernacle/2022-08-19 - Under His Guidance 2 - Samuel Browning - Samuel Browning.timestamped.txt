[37:18] may you just come and just pass by our
[37:20] way father
[37:21] jesus precious name
[37:24] amen
[37:27] amen god bless you this evening
[37:30] listen if we could let's turn into the
[37:32] word of the lord
[37:33] before we're seated and then i'll maybe
[37:36] make just a few announcements
[37:38] but joshua chapter 5 and verse
[37:42] 13
[37:45] if we could go there
[38:05] i just want to come back into this
[38:07] portion of scripture here tonight
[38:09] and just taking the thought
[38:12] under his guidance
[38:14] under his guidance
[38:16] remembering when we
[38:18] i've read the quote and i'm not gonna
[38:20] just refer to it tonight
[38:22] where brother branham is mentioning of
[38:24] our when we're praying and how that we
[38:27] are approaching the promises of god he
[38:29] says once you've come into the promised
[38:31] land he said then you'll find how prayer
[38:34] changes
[38:35] and he says how that we
[38:37] we make that approach
[38:39] for everything that's there before us
[38:41] knowing that god has given us the land
[38:44] and we can stand right there
[38:46] in the face of the enemy and say
[38:49] get off of my property
[38:52] and brother brown makes a key statement
[38:54] he says with that abstract in our hand
[38:57] he says and under the guidance of the
[39:00] holy spirit we adjure
[39:02] satan
[39:04] to take his hands off
[39:06] and i think that's that's where we come
[39:07] to is under his guidance
[39:10] every promise in the book it belongs to
[39:13] us
[39:14] but god has
[39:16] a specific way
[39:18] in his will that continues to unfold
[39:21] that that promise might come to pass
[39:24] and here let's look in joshua 5 and
[39:27] verse 13.
[39:29] here we stand and it says it came to
[39:32] pass
[39:33] that when joshua was by jericho
[39:36] that he lifted up his eyes and looked
[39:38] and behold
[39:40] there stood a man over against him with
[39:43] his sword
[39:44] drawn in his hand
[39:46] and joshua went unto him and said unto
[39:48] him art thou for us
[39:50] or for our adversaries
[39:53] and he said nay but as captain of the
[39:55] host of the lord am i now come
[39:59] and joshua fell on his face to the earth
[40:03] and did worship
[40:04] and said unto him
[40:06] what saith my lord unto his servant it's
[40:09] a very very key
[40:11] very key point in this battle
[40:14] and the captain of the lord's host
[40:17] said unto joshua
[40:19] loose thy shoe
[40:21] from off thy foot
[40:23] for the place where on thou standest is
[40:25] holy
[40:26] and joshua did so
[40:29] amen may god bless you and bless the
[40:31] reading of the word as you're being
[40:32] seated
[40:33] i wanted to just mention to you you've
[40:36] seen uh major probably seen the posts
[40:39] and the emails and things like that with
[40:40] the calendar events and um also here
[40:44] lord willing and this is always weather
[40:46] permitting here with
[40:48] um
[40:49] to have just a
[40:50] i guess we'd titled it just a fire pit
[40:53] fellowship it's not a full-blown mill
[40:55] um
[40:56] it's just uh we just want to get
[40:58] together just for some fellowship it
[41:00] will be on certain times on
[41:02] sunday evenings maybe at times you know
[41:04] when we're scheduled it will let you
[41:05] know but this coming sunday the lord
[41:07] willing at five o'clock we'll um
[41:10] right back there you'll see behind um
[41:13] the building right back here um
[41:15] where the shane was able to put the fire
[41:18] pit together
[41:20] there for us and we so appreciate that
[41:22] and
[41:23] also getting the dirt and we needed the
[41:26] dirt in here and then getting the dirt
[41:27] and i don't know was that wheel barreled
[41:29] or was that tractor over there
[41:32] he was wheel
[41:33] uh we appreciate that too
[41:35] and appreciate you know brother shane
[41:37] was looking out for that he said we
[41:38] don't want no ankles being twisted along
[41:40] there and and so we still have to watch
[41:43] it out here and that's going to be
[41:44] filled in with dirt as well so we just
[41:47] appreciate all that they were
[41:48] communicating about that
[41:50] so lord willing this coming sunday
[41:51] evening if weather permitting at five
[41:54] o'clock we'll just gather back here and
[41:56] just to have just some time just to
[41:58] fellowship and just remind you just to
[42:01] bring comfortable chairs
[42:03] because i'm sure you don't want to sit
[42:04] on folding chairs so you have lawn
[42:07] chairs and so forth you know just bring
[42:09] comfortable chairs you know to to sit in
[42:11] and we'll just have just a little time
[42:13] of fellowship and if you're able to make
[42:15] it well that'd be wonderful is that all
[42:17] right
[42:18] amen so
[42:20] uh with that in mind i just
[42:23] just looking here into the scripture and
[42:26] you know when we look at this portion of
[42:28] the word and i think of this
[42:30] very much because of the time that we're
[42:32] living in
[42:34] we know that we are standing in another
[42:36] ephesians and we know that ephesians
[42:38] itself
[42:40] is where that there is a coming out and
[42:42] a going into we know that it's necessary
[42:46] of how that god would call our lives out
[42:49] of the world and it takes the call that
[42:51] comes from him
[42:53] to come out of the world to bring a
[42:55] separation to bring conviction in our
[42:57] life to realize
[42:58] that there is there is there is
[43:00] something deeper there is something
[43:02] wrong you know a person can actually sit
[43:04] in a church for a long time
[43:06] but then once they hear the word of god
[43:08] to realize that god is calling to them
[43:11] to come out beyond all their unbelief
[43:14] and unbelief itself is not just you know
[43:17] is is that of attributes attributes of
[43:20] unbelief drinking smoking lusting and
[43:22] all that that's all attributes of
[43:24] unbelief
[43:25] but unbelief itself is what god as he
[43:28] came to deal with to where that we're
[43:30] not just acceptive of some promises and
[43:34] make excuses as to why that some
[43:37] promises can't be
[43:38] but to recognize that the god who made
[43:41] the promise
[43:42] he's the god to fulfill the promise
[43:45] he's never he's not been diminished he's
[43:48] not lost any power it doesn't matter how
[43:50] wicked that the age has become
[43:53] god has not diminished in power
[43:54] whatsoever
[43:56] man's mind when man has gone away from
[44:00] god's way of approaching the word and
[44:03] the approach of the word is by the holy
[44:06] spirit it's under god's leadership it's
[44:08] the supernatural
[44:10] in reality when we look at it that in
[44:12] order to be a real believer you've got
[44:14] to be born of the supernatural
[44:17] and there are experiences that in your
[44:19] life that you can have of the
[44:20] supernatural and if not then all this
[44:24] book is
[44:26] is a collection of stories
[44:28] but once the holy spirit who is the
[44:31] author of the book the bible tells us
[44:33] that the prophets men of old who were
[44:36] set aside as vessels that the
[44:38] inspiration of god could drop down
[44:41] and be able to give utterance and
[44:43] inspiration and then through that the
[44:46] holy spirit he inspires the word to
[44:48] where it's no longer just a book of
[44:50] history
[44:51] but it's a book of prophecy
[44:53] when we read in the scriptures and have
[44:57] been identified with the living god
[44:59] we're not just looking at the red sea as
[45:01] an event that happened to a group of
[45:03] people back there
[45:05] but we have experienced a god who makes
[45:08] a way
[45:10] we've experienced that same god and no
[45:13] matter what comes our way that
[45:16] experience is what takes us through
[45:18] through every situation every opposition
[45:22] everything that we can ever face we come
[45:24] right back to say i know that he's the
[45:27] living god
[45:29] what he did for them
[45:30] he will do for me as well
[45:33] so you know it's like in this one in
[45:36] this way where you know brother branham
[45:38] would say it in the message great
[45:39] warrior joshua he would say when they
[45:42] look at the word and say well the word
[45:44] is not able to work he said oh yes the
[45:47] word is able to work it only takes the
[45:50] author who gave the word to make it to
[45:53] work
[45:54] and so when we are looking at this this
[45:57] ephesians i feel like this i don't just
[45:59] feel i i know that this is a parallel of
[46:02] where you and i are living because
[46:03] joshua it types the walk and the life of
[46:07] a holy ghost filled believer
[46:10] that there there are promises and and
[46:13] you know even to desire the holy spirit
[46:16] you're blessed
[46:18] because
[46:19] many don't have any desire for that and
[46:22] that's the bible blessed are they who do
[46:25] hunger thirst for righteousness for they
[46:27] shall be filled it's a it's a blessing
[46:29] to have a call in your life that it says
[46:32] there's got to be more
[46:34] a blessing that when you can hear the
[46:36] word of god dealing with your life and
[46:39] you realize that there's more than just
[46:41] where i'm at and and that goes on in our
[46:44] walk with god it doesn't stop when you
[46:46] receive the holy ghost it keeps on there
[46:49] there is something that is raised up in
[46:51] you a love for the things of god that
[46:54] you desire to have more of god and and
[46:57] in knowing that he's all that you need
[46:59] in every part of your life and so this
[47:03] is very fitting for even the time that
[47:06] you and i are living in when we look at
[47:09] this with joshua because we know that
[47:11] there are promises that are here that
[47:14] are right before us and i want you just
[47:17] to look at this in in this manner that
[47:20] joshua he knew that jericho was the
[47:23] first objective
[47:25] uh we don't have anything uh maybe in
[47:28] the scripture that would where we can
[47:30] read that the lord told joshua to go and
[47:32] take jericho first but he knew by
[47:36] inspiration even before crossing the
[47:39] river that this was the first place to
[47:43] take
[47:44] and so we know he sent the spies out but
[47:46] i want to bring us into this line of
[47:49] thought right here tonight so the
[47:51] question itself that joshua had was not
[47:55] was was not about whether or not it was
[47:58] the will of god to take jericho but
[48:01] rather the question was
[48:03] how
[48:04] and you'll find that this is something
[48:06] that you and i are brought face-to-face
[48:10] face-to-face with one of the ways time
[48:13] and time again there are things that we
[48:15] can look at and we know to be the will
[48:18] of god how do we know it's the will of
[48:20] god well it's not by feeling it's not by
[48:23] an impression because of feeling or
[48:24] impression if it deviates from the word
[48:28] then we forsake it
[48:30] but we know that it's the will of god
[48:32] when it is
[48:34] with the word of god if there's anything
[48:37] in the word that would speak against
[48:39] that then we know it's not the will of
[48:43] god now we might have difficulty maybe
[48:46] as a new christian or it doesn't matter
[48:48] where you're at in your journey you
[48:49] might be looking and saying even of
[48:51] knowing scripture knowing the message
[48:53] and yet looking at things and saying
[48:55] lord is this according to your will
[48:58] because
[48:59] the will of god goes much deeper than
[49:01] just the print on the page the will of
[49:04] god comes down into our motive and our
[49:06] objective on wanting to see god's will
[49:10] fulfilled that's another part of it and
[49:12] that's all that lays within there that
[49:14] god would would call and would speak to
[49:17] our lives so many things we come to in
[49:19] the will of god that we look at you know
[49:21] even when you look at the any promise
[49:23] that is there before us any promise that
[49:26] god has made such as the holy ghost and
[49:29] deliverance well there's not a question
[49:30] of is this god's will that i received
[49:33] the holy ghost is it god's will that i
[49:35] be made whole there's not a question
[49:38] about that that is the will of god but
[49:41] the how
[49:43] is the question
[49:45] what's the pathway
[49:47] what's the channel
[49:49] and that's always that's the part that
[49:52] where it brings us into that place of
[49:54] relying upon the holy spirit even though
[49:57] being filled with the spirit of god that
[50:00] brings us to that place of being led by
[50:03] the holy spirit
[50:07] there are times that let me go to
[50:09] another part of it there are times that
[50:11] we're praying and seeking
[50:13] whether something is the will of god
[50:17] joshua knows jericho is the will of god
[50:20] he doesn't know the how but there are
[50:21] times that you and i are praying and
[50:24] we're seeking for god's will
[50:26] maybe it's choices that we have before
[50:28] us
[50:30] it's choices that we're looking at maybe
[50:32] it's jobs
[50:33] where to live
[50:34] church home
[50:36] on and on these are choices that we have
[50:38] before us and god's not going to make
[50:40] the choices for us
[50:42] even if you know even of those of us
[50:45] that are married know that there had to
[50:46] be there was choices set before us and
[50:49] and there had to be a decision made and
[50:52] and even young people and others that
[50:54] come into that place you see paul haven
[50:57] had choices before him
[50:59] and paul just like you and i paul was
[51:02] was looking at do i go this way and take
[51:05] the man take the word of god do i go to
[51:07] asia or do i go to macedonia he did not
[51:11] know which way to go but paul said the
[51:14] bible said he assayed or tested if it
[51:18] would be god's will to go this way but
[51:20] notice in testing it he hadn't fully
[51:24] committed to going to asia at that
[51:26] moment
[51:27] but yet in a dream because he had tested
[51:31] and saying lord this is how i'm feeling
[51:33] but still what is your will concerning
[51:36] this i i believe that that's that's
[51:38] victory right there in our lives is
[51:41] knowing the the the promises and the
[51:44] power and the authority the blessing the
[51:46] peace the rest that comes from being in
[51:49] the will of god and paul could test just
[51:52] like you and i contest certain things it
[51:54] doesn't mean that we have committed to
[51:56] doing it but you can test it and say
[51:59] lord this is what i'm feeling but even
[52:02] though my feeling and i'm leaning this
[52:04] way
[52:05] what is your will
[52:07] and when we're left open to that that
[52:10] means we're always left open to
[52:13] what is your say on this you see we're
[52:17] living in the time when the amen has
[52:20] spoken and the amen is the final word
[52:24] the amen is the soviet and the bible
[52:27] speaks to you and i from the book of
[52:28] isaiah tying us into that future home
[52:32] that we in ourselves receive the
[52:35] blessing of god by blessing ourselves in
[52:39] the god of the amen and that's what we
[52:42] seek for in our lives we want to know
[52:44] not what we say but what does the amen
[52:48] say within this
[52:55] i know sometimes we can pray and we're
[52:57] trying to
[52:58] pull something out of god but that's not
[53:00] really praying
[53:03] when we pray it's not trying to pull
[53:05] something out
[53:08] you realize brother branham when he had
[53:10] to bring cornet correction
[53:13] even when brother neville you know it
[53:16] we believe in tongues we believe in
[53:17] prophecy we believe in interpretations
[53:20] but brother branham showing us that even
[53:22] where there were those who coming to be
[53:25] prayed for there were certain things
[53:26] they were trying to pull to be said in
[53:29] their way and it caught brother neville
[53:31] yielded to it and he spoke things and
[53:33] the holy spirit had to bring correction
[53:35] because he was being pulled according to
[53:38] what the desires were
[53:40] we don't want our desires that god has
[53:44] to come down to our desires we want our
[53:47] desires to match god's desires and first
[53:50] of all say lord if my desires aren't
[53:52] matching yours remedy that in my life
[53:55] and then asking god fulfill your desire
[53:59] in me
[54:00] we don't want to try to pull him any
[54:02] certain way and you know well you know
[54:04] lord i'm feeling we don't want to do
[54:06] that because we know within that is
[54:09] never peace is never rest if we have to
[54:12] pull something we'll have to keep
[54:13] pulling and keep propping and everything
[54:16] else because it will be our work
[54:21] and paul
[54:22] paul remember god sent a man dressed in
[54:25] a dream in macedonian garb and let paul
[54:28] know do not go to toward asia at this
[54:31] time but come then go this way
[54:35] you realize that only a chapter two
[54:37] chapters later in the book of acts that
[54:39] paul was sent into asia right
[54:41] you and i might look at it and say well
[54:42] why couldn't he go at that time because
[54:45] it wasn't god's timing
[54:48] it wasn't god's way
[54:51] and god part of god's will is always his
[54:54] timing is always his way
[54:56] is the how behind it
[54:59] ezra and just giving you another example
[55:01] in ezra and when you read this in the
[55:03] scripture i always loved this in ezra
[55:06] chapter 8 where ezra he's returning back
[55:09] into jerusalem after they've been in
[55:11] babylon and ezra is returning back with
[55:14] treasuries and everything that's going
[55:16] to go in the house of god and everything
[55:18] that's to be put in there the furniture
[55:20] and all those things that were there in
[55:22] babylon when they had been exiled and
[55:25] carried away now ezra is coming forth
[55:28] and he comes to the river of uh and ezra
[55:31] stands there and he realizes between us
[55:34] and jerusalem there's a lot of bandits
[55:37] there's a lot of people that with all of
[55:39] the treasuries that we're carrying this
[55:42] is a lot of value
[55:44] and ezra realizes at that moment he says
[55:47] i've already given testimony to the king
[55:50] that the hand of the lord is upon us so
[55:54] i'm not going to go back to him and say
[55:55] hey could you give us some accompaniment
[55:58] down here to jerusalem ezra said i
[56:00] couldn't do that i've already testified
[56:03] god's hand is upon this but he
[56:05] recognized that that moment he had
[56:08] access to the throne of god to the one
[56:11] that had led him to that place he knew
[56:14] like joshua coming back to jerusalem
[56:16] bringing these treasuries was the will
[56:18] of god but how to do it is what we need
[56:23] to know
[56:24] and through prayer and fasting they all
[56:28] begin through prayer and fasting god
[56:30] came down and he answered to take what
[56:32] was there and divide it out and portion
[56:35] it out among the levites and they would
[56:38] all travel in their way and then come
[56:40] there to jerusalem and you find that
[56:43] though every one of those portions that
[56:45] were given out and came back to
[56:47] jerusalem when they met there everything
[56:50] was just as it was when they divided it
[56:53] boy we could preach on the holy ghost
[56:55] right now but you recognize that when
[56:57] they found the will of god as far as the
[57:01] how to it then there was a rest
[57:04] is everybody with me
[57:06] so there's different times and different
[57:08] things that we're looking at with the
[57:10] will of god in our journey in our life
[57:13] and notice the scripture that you and i
[57:16] would be an identification
[57:19] for of the bride of jesus christ in this
[57:21] hour
[57:22] and would be that of john 5 19. for the
[57:26] son can do nothing
[57:28] of himself
[57:30] but what he seeth the father doing that
[57:33] doeth the son likewise
[57:35] that is a scriptural identification
[57:37] because whatever it was with the
[57:39] bridegroom it will be with the bride
[57:43] that's why you can look at anything that
[57:45] isn't going according to the word of god
[57:48] is not open to the channel of the voice
[57:51] of god you know it's not the bride
[57:53] because the bride walks in step with the
[57:56] groom
[57:57] because she is one with him just like a
[58:00] uh you know a wife would be to her
[58:02] husband she is to reflect the ambitions
[58:06] and the desires and all the plans of
[58:09] even of that man is that right
[58:12] so notice that within this there is a
[58:14] harmony that that is present or is to
[58:18] exist within the bride of jesus christ
[58:21] now first john 5 14
[58:23] this is the confidence that we have in
[58:27] him
[58:28] and if we ask anything according to his
[58:32] will he heareth us
[58:35] and if we know that he hear us
[58:38] whatsoever we ask we know that we have
[58:41] the petitions that we desired of him now
[58:44] notice of this certainty if we have a
[58:47] confidence in him
[58:49] what confidence john do we have well the
[58:52] confidence that we have that if we ask
[58:54] anything according to his will
[58:56] that he hears us
[58:58] and that these petitions that that we
[59:01] have what we have desired of him that
[59:04] that he will hear us and whatsoever that
[59:08] we ask well what's the sign that he's
[59:10] hearing us is god is working in our
[59:13] lives and moving to perform his word
[59:17] does it always happen right then and
[59:19] there no because if god did it just like
[59:22] that we would become even more impatient
[59:26] than what we are
[59:28] we would become more you know
[59:31] with that of impatience and you know
[59:33] reliant upon that instead of relying
[59:36] upon god now notice prayer itself there
[59:40] is the key that opens every door
[59:45] if you're standing before a door
[59:47] like joshua was he knew jericho was the
[59:50] will of god
[59:52] but there's a key to open that door
[59:56] and that key to open that door brother
[59:59] bram says it like this he says the key
[1:00:01] to every mystery the key to open every
[1:00:04] door of everything that is of god is
[1:00:08] through prayer
[1:00:09] he says it like this when he's
[1:00:11] ministering in the revelation series uh
[1:00:14] chapter 4 and brother branham lays this
[1:00:17] in here and this just really grabbed the
[1:00:18] hold of my attention here uh you know
[1:00:20] the other day brother baby said it like
[1:00:22] this he says you know the song that
[1:00:24] there's only one way he said that to
[1:00:27] ever get the blessings of god and he
[1:00:30] said like this he rehearses the song
[1:00:32] let's pray pray pray the only way to
[1:00:35] reach higher ground pray pray the prayer
[1:00:37] faith will bring god's blessings down
[1:00:41] so if the prayer of faith brings god's
[1:00:43] blessings down let's continue to pray
[1:00:48] brother graham goes on to talking about
[1:00:49] you know continuing to pray to be
[1:00:51] further in to the kingdom of god and on
[1:00:54] up the road now remember here is
[1:00:55] joshua's standing here and he's walking
[1:00:58] around jericho
[1:01:00] and he's looking at the walls the bible
[1:01:02] tells us here when we read he came
[1:01:04] around the walls and joshua he's out
[1:01:07] there on the plane and he's looking at
[1:01:09] it and joshua is wondering when he's
[1:01:12] looking at the way
[1:01:14] of what is god's way of how god has
[1:01:18] planned to do this
[1:01:20] now i'll tell you what
[1:01:21] that takes patience
[1:01:25] he already knew it was god's objective
[1:01:28] that jericho was the will of god now
[1:01:31] here comes patience
[1:01:33] to come and say
[1:01:35] now that we're here we've crossed over
[1:01:38] and he has patience now to approach
[1:01:41] the will before god's way to be made
[1:01:44] known because when god's made known his
[1:01:47] will you see when god lets him know
[1:01:49] jericho you're to take jericho joshua
[1:01:52] just to go without knowing the way
[1:01:56] is to go presuming
[1:02:00] joshua would have been frustrated does
[1:02:02] he know it's the will of god without a
[1:02:04] shadow of doubt he knows it's god's will
[1:02:07] but he's looking for the how to it
[1:02:12] and that's where
[1:02:13] we come to
[1:02:14] you can take anything in your life
[1:02:17] whether it's any promise
[1:02:19] any promise that pertains there is a way
[1:02:22] for that promise to be fulfilled
[1:02:25] now let me just let me just dial in here
[1:02:27] just a moment
[1:02:28] that way
[1:02:29] is not five steps to a better this or
[1:02:32] two steps to this remember there is only
[1:02:35] one way and god is that way
[1:02:41] there's two ways to anything
[1:02:44] right you heard brother wayne preach
[1:02:46] this we've preached this over the time
[1:02:48] see it only applied to the new birth it
[1:02:51] comes down to every aspect of our life
[1:02:53] there's always two ways
[1:02:55] our way and god's way
[1:02:59] and guess whose way is always wrong
[1:03:02] our way
[1:03:04] and whose way is always right
[1:03:07] god's way
[1:03:09] always two ways to every promise of god
[1:03:14] now faith itself joshua has a faith when
[1:03:17] he's going and he's asking
[1:03:19] in confidence he's letting the petitions
[1:03:22] be known lord
[1:03:24] what is the way into this city
[1:03:28] how are we going to take this city down
[1:03:31] now faith it is a revelation of the will
[1:03:33] of god and i i want to just just just
[1:03:35] just go upon this just a moment
[1:03:37] when you look at the word and notice the
[1:03:40] promise that god has given them about
[1:03:42] treading down
[1:03:45] the promises or treading upon what
[1:03:48] belongs to them let me read a few
[1:03:49] scriptures here
[1:03:51] in deuteronomy 11 25 god speaks through
[1:03:54] moses there shall no man be able to
[1:03:56] stand before you for the lord your god
[1:03:59] shall lay the fear of you and the dread
[1:04:01] of you upon all the land that you shall
[1:04:04] tread upon as he said to you in
[1:04:07] deuteronomy 33 29 happy art towel israel
[1:04:10] who is like unto thee o people saved by
[1:04:13] the lord the shield of thy help who is
[1:04:16] the sword of thy excellency and thine
[1:04:18] enemies shall be found liars unto thee
[1:04:22] and thou shalt tread upon their high
[1:04:25] places
[1:04:26] now in joshua chapter one verse three
[1:04:29] now joshua has heard this he's been a
[1:04:32] partaker of this as for the rest of
[1:04:33] israel has but now it's come down
[1:04:37] personally joshua's heard the message
[1:04:40] but see the messenger has come and gone
[1:04:42] moses delivered the message remember
[1:04:45] moses god gave that message to moses and
[1:04:49] god was not gonna let that that message
[1:04:52] fail it didn't matter how many
[1:04:55] unbelievers were there then they looked
[1:04:57] and said we can't take the land that the
[1:04:59] giants are too big and this and this
[1:05:01] that didn't mean anything to god
[1:05:04] god's message will never fail
[1:05:09] and about the time it looks like it's
[1:05:11] going to fail that's when god steps in
[1:05:15] god always steps in at that time
[1:05:18] like in eden when it looked like it was
[1:05:20] nothing but failure all around god
[1:05:23] stepped in
[1:05:25] and god let it be known my message is
[1:05:27] not a failure
[1:05:29] [Music]
[1:05:31] god meant everything he said
[1:05:33] he said everything he meant
[1:05:35] and god will bring it to pass in his own
[1:05:38] time
[1:05:40] i find it remarkable in the first
[1:05:42] message the prophet preaches in the
[1:05:44] message shalom out of the two and he
[1:05:46] takes that time it's almost like where
[1:05:48] he is he's actually sitting in a living
[1:05:50] room setting and he's ministering any
[1:05:52] and he's dealing with the fulfillment of
[1:05:55] the word that is that we are actually
[1:05:57] under in this hour to see the fulfilling
[1:06:00] of all things the the end of the time is
[1:06:03] here just seeing those things that you
[1:06:05] know it speaks of how the pope you know
[1:06:08] going to visit jerusalem and then the
[1:06:10] moon has the phases of the moon right
[1:06:12] there in the sky of that week it went to
[1:06:15] a complete darkness and a blackness and
[1:06:18] he ties it in with you know melchizedek
[1:06:21] you know coming to meet abraham
[1:06:23] melchizedek was kicked out of the
[1:06:24] churches and just as christ was put out
[1:06:27] of the church and he meets him there
[1:06:29] just before he gets back home and
[1:06:31] brother bram is laying all this out of
[1:06:32] the time that you and i and where we are
[1:06:35] at and then he comes to the end of the
[1:06:37] message and he says what we must have
[1:06:41] brethren is patience
[1:06:43] he said because some can get under a an
[1:06:47] impression or an enthusiasm and they're
[1:06:50] trying to make something come to pass
[1:06:52] and you cannot make things come to pass
[1:06:58] this is why the bible think of this the
[1:07:00] bible doesn't contradict itself the
[1:07:02] bible says let a man study to show
[1:07:04] himself worthy is that right
[1:07:06] the bible encourages us to get into the
[1:07:08] word of god right but then the bible
[1:07:10] over here in the old testament i believe
[1:07:12] it's the book of proverbs that much
[1:07:14] study weareth oneself
[1:07:17] what is much steady
[1:07:19] is where one is trying to prove and
[1:07:22] trying to press
[1:07:23] there is no revelation
[1:07:26] nothing that comes from god by our own
[1:07:28] efforts into something
[1:07:30] we can we should give ourselves we
[1:07:33] should read how many times has this
[1:07:35] happened to us we're listening to the
[1:07:37] message we're reading in the scriptures
[1:07:39] we're we're just you know in
[1:07:40] fellowshipping with the lord and just
[1:07:42] things that maybe we don't we can't see
[1:07:45] or maybe don't even see the real of the
[1:07:47] application and it coming down
[1:07:48] personally and you get into service and
[1:07:51] maybe it's after that service you're
[1:07:53] you're out on your job or you're
[1:07:54] somewhere out and the spirit of god just
[1:07:56] takes that and opens that to you and you
[1:07:58] say oh there it is and it's an
[1:08:01] application to your life it's not
[1:08:04] something that you've pried your way
[1:08:06] into
[1:08:08] you've been led into it
[1:08:12] oh i wish i could stay there a moment
[1:08:14] you've been led into it now just stay
[1:08:16] with me here on this thought because i
[1:08:17] believe that's the inspiration at this
[1:08:19] moment
[1:08:20] notice joshua has heard this
[1:08:23] now comes the sounding to him personally
[1:08:26] every place in joshua 1 3 every place
[1:08:28] that the soul of your foot shall tread
[1:08:30] upon now the message has announced to
[1:08:34] all of these promises all this land
[1:08:36] belongs to you but now
[1:08:39] you've got to put your foot down
[1:08:42] you've got to move into the promises
[1:08:44] joshua everywhere you
[1:08:46] place your foot should tread upon i've
[1:08:49] given you as i spoke to moses and he
[1:08:52] goes through all the dimensions in verse
[1:08:54] 4. that word tread means to march
[1:08:58] it means to move forward upon now
[1:09:00] treading itself is moving under the
[1:09:04] leadership
[1:09:05] into the promises of god
[1:09:07] it's marching forward
[1:09:10] with the authority of the word of god
[1:09:12] under the guidance of the holy spirit so
[1:09:14] it's not
[1:09:15] us
[1:09:16] uh
[1:09:17] forcing our way into something you see
[1:09:20] when we were even to think about let me
[1:09:22] just step back just a moment
[1:09:24] even as we're looking and uh i believe
[1:09:27] we were looking at this a little bit
[1:09:29] last week that when we speak about
[1:09:31] footsteps our possession
[1:09:33] and that how that all the promises are
[1:09:35] for us
[1:09:36] we recognize that it's not
[1:09:39] up to us to determine the how
[1:09:42] something's going to be
[1:09:44] it's not us footsteps being possession
[1:09:47] simply means that that word is ringing
[1:09:50] to my heart and i'm going to stand upon
[1:09:53] that word i'm going to call that word
[1:09:56] and that promise mine
[1:10:02] but if you call it yours
[1:10:05] with already a way that it's going to
[1:10:06] happen or this is the way it's going to
[1:10:08] be
[1:10:10] you'll find yourself defeated
[1:10:12] the word has never been defeated
[1:10:16] never the word has never ever suffered a
[1:10:19] loss
[1:10:20] but it's in those moments god's bringing
[1:10:22] a real practical application to our
[1:10:25] lives realizing that it must be
[1:10:29] me fulfill my word through you
[1:10:34] that's the whole victory right there is
[1:10:36] god fulfilling his word through our life
[1:10:38] so this this treading is marching in the
[1:10:42] promises of god i want you to think of
[1:10:44] it in this term when you look at john in
[1:10:47] revelations 1 the bible said he was in
[1:10:50] the spirit on the lord's day and he
[1:10:52] heard the voice behind him it spake like
[1:10:55] a trumpet
[1:10:56] now the trumpet was a signification this
[1:10:59] was god speaking it had meaning to him
[1:11:04] are you with me
[1:11:05] this goes back to the thing some things
[1:11:07] that we said at the beginning part of
[1:11:09] the service this morning uh this evening
[1:11:11] that it's a blessing to desire the
[1:11:14] spirit of god because the message goes
[1:11:16] out but it's only sent to the elect
[1:11:22] god's got an intended audience let him
[1:11:25] that hath and ear let him hear what the
[1:11:28] spirit is saying
[1:11:31] everybody can hear it and others can say
[1:11:33] well that's just another just another
[1:11:35] man just like moody or anybody else or
[1:11:37] this is just like this well god always
[1:11:40] has used vessels that's true but god has
[1:11:43] messengers and messengers are those who
[1:11:46] are reflecting the trueness and the
[1:11:50] purity and power of the atonement into
[1:11:53] the church of the living god
[1:11:56] a messenger is one who's got a message
[1:12:00] now a man can have a message but where
[1:12:03] does he get that message from
[1:12:05] if that message is contrary to the word
[1:12:08] he never got that message from god
[1:12:12] is that right
[1:12:13] but god has vessels every one of those
[1:12:16] seven messengers are stars that were
[1:12:19] ordained for a distinct time and an age
[1:12:23] to be used by god that the promise that
[1:12:27] god desired to come to pass in that age
[1:12:30] you know that promise they would become
[1:12:32] so entwined and taken with that promise
[1:12:35] they would become one with that promise
[1:12:38] it would it would kind of say like this
[1:12:39] it would eat up their entire life
[1:12:43] if it did that way to the messengers
[1:12:46] what does it do upon the people of god
[1:12:50] it eats up our life it it it's just
[1:12:53] moving and he become it's the full
[1:12:55] pulsation and desire of our life
[1:13:06] sometimes i know we can think well you
[1:13:08] know i i really desire and i really you
[1:13:11] know i i really you know people can say
[1:13:13] well i really desire you know of the
[1:13:15] lord and i i really love the lord but
[1:13:16] are you treading on ground
[1:13:19] are you marching
[1:13:22] are you marching or or are you
[1:13:25] still in the place that you were before
[1:13:29] it's time to
[1:13:30] move
[1:13:32] it's time to move if you listen if you
[1:13:34] don't walk in the light while light is
[1:13:36] present darkness will overtake you
[1:13:40] satan can send all kinds of distractions
[1:13:42] to try to hinder that voice there's a
[1:13:44] lot of voices in the world in today
[1:13:49] is that right but there's one voice that
[1:13:52] has true leadership and that's the voice
[1:13:55] of the holy spirit
[1:13:58] not the voice of man's reasoning but the
[1:14:00] voice of the holy spirit so here is john
[1:14:03] he turns and looks to see the voice
[1:14:06] because he knows a voice is a person
[1:14:10] he he don't turn to feel something he
[1:14:13] turns to see i want to see who's talking
[1:14:15] to me
[1:14:16] that voice has caused him to turn oh my
[1:14:20] and now notice he turns to see it the
[1:14:22] bible tells us now in revelations 4 the
[1:14:26] after the end of those things after the
[1:14:29] ages have passed the coming to the end
[1:14:31] of the church ages and here he says that
[1:14:34] same voice that i heard before that
[1:14:37] spake with me it spake to me again and
[1:14:40] it told me come up
[1:14:42] hither
[1:14:44] because i'm going to show you things
[1:14:46] that are to come
[1:14:47] what is it it would be a rapturing
[1:14:50] message
[1:14:51] a message that is catching us away from
[1:14:55] this worldly sphere and gravity and
[1:14:59] drawing us away from all unbelief you
[1:15:01] know what that voice was that voice is
[1:15:04] the voice of god in this last day that
[1:15:07] has called us into and ephesians
[1:15:10] into the promises of god
[1:15:15] because every word of god is a trumpet
[1:15:19] when god steps down and begins to sound
[1:15:23] that trumpet it is an alarm to the
[1:15:25] people of god start treading on promises
[1:15:33] what authority do i have the highest
[1:15:35] authority there could ever be
[1:15:38] god has spoken let tell me what devil
[1:15:41] can prophesy
[1:15:43] what one could raise his head up and say
[1:15:45] well that ain't so bad him for you god
[1:15:47] has spoken shut your mouth
[1:15:51] god has spoken to me
[1:15:55] come on friends it's time to tread upon
[1:15:57] the promises
[1:16:00] hallelujah now with the treading
[1:16:04] remember the scripture we read
[1:16:07] this is the confidence that we have in
[1:16:09] him if we ask anything according to his
[1:16:11] will he heareth us
[1:16:14] and the lord jesus
[1:16:16] over and over
[1:16:18] in the scriptures
[1:16:20] he was not forgetting what he was saying
[1:16:23] he was not just repeating remember
[1:16:24] through the gospels they're capturing
[1:16:26] what has taken place
[1:16:28] in matthew notice where it wrote in
[1:16:30] matthew
[1:16:32] if that faith would say
[1:16:34] faith would speak to this mountain and
[1:16:37] there be no
[1:16:38] doubt within your heart
[1:16:41] nothing to hinder what's matthew the
[1:16:43] lion
[1:16:45] there's a courage there's a boldness
[1:16:47] that this is my promise that belongs to
[1:16:49] me
[1:16:51] say to this mountain be thou removed
[1:16:54] plucked up and cast into yonder sea and
[1:16:56] the very next scripture says and
[1:16:58] whatsoever you ask ye
[1:17:01] shall ask in prayer and receive it amen
[1:17:05] now think of this in john 14 uh uh 12 he
[1:17:10] that believeth on me the works that i do
[1:17:12] shall you do also greater works than
[1:17:14] these because i go to the father and
[1:17:16] whatsoever you shall ask in my name
[1:17:19] that will i do that the father may be
[1:17:21] glorified in the son
[1:17:23] if you shall ask anything in my name i
[1:17:25] will do it what's his name
[1:17:29] it's his will
[1:17:32] his character
[1:17:36] oh my
[1:17:37] you see this asking and praying is not
[1:17:40] just you know just saying little words
[1:17:44] but it's asking god and looking at
[1:17:46] things and listen this is part of a
[1:17:48] journey it's part of experience a pastor
[1:17:50] can't hand you this like a manual like
[1:17:52] oh this is how you do it it's part of
[1:17:54] our journey with almighty god that we
[1:17:58] need god to remedy if our heart is not
[1:18:01] matching god's desire we might be
[1:18:04] praying about something but we don't
[1:18:06] have our desires right in it
[1:18:10] and so we can't say well i'm asking this
[1:18:13] according to your name this is in your
[1:18:16] word lord but god said but your desires
[1:18:19] are not lined up right
[1:18:22] the desires is all about it's all about
[1:18:24] you
[1:18:28] notice this word ask
[1:18:31] the word ask means
[1:18:33] right here in the scriptures from what
[1:18:34] we're praying
[1:18:36] to ask to beg to call for to crave
[1:18:39] desire or to require
[1:18:43] it kind of it puts you to the reality of
[1:18:46] why the spirit of this age says i'm rich
[1:18:50] increased with goods and i don't need to
[1:18:52] ask you for no more because i've got it
[1:18:54] all
[1:18:56] lord you've given us a full message well
[1:18:59] he has
[1:19:00] but the way in taking the promises of
[1:19:03] god is by treading is by asking
[1:19:09] is as the word of god is sounding to our
[1:19:11] lives so
[1:19:13] god wants us to ask him for things
[1:19:18] i hope this doesn't stumble you
[1:19:21] but it brings us to a place to
[1:19:22] understand
[1:19:25] joshua would have never known
[1:19:28] what the plan was for the walls of
[1:19:30] jericho
[1:19:31] had he not asked
[1:19:34] i want you to think about that's real
[1:19:36] deep
[1:19:37] if he didn't even have a desire
[1:19:40] to want to know
[1:19:41] i look at that in the book of revelation
[1:19:43] where it said i heard that voice and
[1:19:46] then the next scripture said immediately
[1:19:48] i was in the spirit of the lord see that
[1:19:50] word it come to a place where john where
[1:19:53] the spirit of god was speaking and he
[1:19:55] was right in tune with the word to say
[1:19:56] yes lord be it unto me caught away
[1:20:02] go with me tonight
[1:20:04] it's just that simple that you see it's
[1:20:06] not that's why for the bride we're not
[1:20:08] being pulled into things or pushed into
[1:20:11] things we're being cut away
[1:20:14] the word is speaking and see it starts
[1:20:17] right here and listen you can sit right
[1:20:18] here tonight and say well man i know i'm
[1:20:20] not there yet but what does your heart
[1:20:22] say within it if your heart says yea
[1:20:25] lord be it unto me according to thy will
[1:20:28] you know what you're doing you're
[1:20:29] loosening every tie so you can be caught
[1:20:32] away in his presence
[1:20:37] hallelujah that's the simplicity of
[1:20:39] treading treading is not looking at
[1:20:41] yourself treading is looking
[1:20:44] to the voice that is speaking to you
[1:20:49] and you know the things that we pray for
[1:20:51] it becomes more personal in our journey
[1:20:54] because things start coming to light
[1:20:55] more and more in our journey we start
[1:20:57] recognizing complex as we have or have
[1:20:59] developed
[1:21:00] we start right we recognize our
[1:21:02] insufficiencies
[1:21:06] and you know the blood of jesus christ
[1:21:09] does not take away our insufficiencies
[1:21:12] the blood of jesus christ cleanses us
[1:21:15] that the spirit of god the life of that
[1:21:17] blood may come and set in the midst of
[1:21:19] us
[1:21:20] and here we are surrounded
[1:21:22] by infirmity
[1:21:24] surrounded by weakness
[1:21:27] surrounded in a place to where god has
[1:21:30] called
[1:21:31] and desires these things to be done and
[1:21:33] we look at ourself
[1:21:36] as paul could stand there in romans 7
[1:21:38] and say
[1:21:40] the things that i want to do
[1:21:42] and desiring
[1:21:44] yet i find not
[1:21:46] how to perform them
[1:21:48] you know why of looking how to perform
[1:21:50] it listen romans 7 that speaks of a
[1:21:52] converted man
[1:21:54] but what paul is recognizing within it
[1:21:56] there's a battle there's a war but
[1:21:59] looking within it that the power that is
[1:22:02] needed what's being called for it's not
[1:22:05] by my not by power but by my spirit
[1:22:07] saith the lord
[1:22:09] so the performing of god's will is us
[1:22:13] comes to pass by us yielding
[1:22:15] our will
[1:22:18] that's really the kernel of tonight let
[1:22:20] me just abolish it just a few moments
[1:22:21] here
[1:22:22] because everything becomes very personal
[1:22:24] to us
[1:22:26] every promise that god has given us is
[1:22:28] yea
[1:22:29] and amen is that right
[1:22:31] now notice within that brother braham
[1:22:33] said he can't change
[1:22:35] he said but god will do things in
[1:22:37] unexpected ways
[1:22:39] but hold on
[1:22:41] until it comes now god will do things in
[1:22:43] unexpected ways just keep that just a
[1:22:45] moment
[1:22:47] don't tell god
[1:22:50] how you want him to do it
[1:22:55] you see that's what the churches have
[1:22:57] done
[1:22:59] they've told god this is how people are
[1:23:01] going to be members
[1:23:03] all they got to do is put their name on
[1:23:04] the book and shake the hand or believe
[1:23:07] these tendents or believe these creeds
[1:23:09] or all they got to do is believe this
[1:23:11] man has told tried to tell god
[1:23:14] but this is god's program not man's
[1:23:16] program
[1:23:18] god don't need some net wit brain
[1:23:20] telling him how to do things
[1:23:23] this is why brother brown said we must
[1:23:25] pray until we come back into god's
[1:23:28] program
[1:23:30] that's what the message of the hour has
[1:23:32] come to do is bring us back into god's
[1:23:37] program
[1:23:39] not a church program a man's program but
[1:23:43] god's program
[1:23:44] where god leads his people god leads the
[1:23:47] church
[1:23:49] in your everyday life god's leading you
[1:23:52] and you've got confidence just like
[1:23:54] joshua you might be going before jobs
[1:23:57] you might be going a situation of a
[1:23:58] spouse you might be going right there
[1:24:00] before children you whatever it is and
[1:24:02] you're going there and saying i know
[1:24:04] that this is god's will but how
[1:24:11] you're not questioning how if god's able
[1:24:14] to do it because you know him
[1:24:17] i said you know him
[1:24:19] and you know he specializes in things
[1:24:22] that are impossible
[1:24:23] he changed your life
[1:24:25] that was impossible for one man to
[1:24:28] change another man a man cannot change a
[1:24:30] woman and a woman can't change a man it
[1:24:33] takes god to bring a change on the
[1:24:35] inside a church can't change you but it
[1:24:38] takes the holy ghost to bring a change
[1:24:40] in your life
[1:24:43] that's god's way of doing it
[1:24:46] so he said you don't tell god what you
[1:24:47] want him to do
[1:24:50] he will do it the way
[1:24:52] he wants to do it
[1:24:54] don't tell him he said how to do it
[1:24:58] now when it says
[1:25:00] unexpected ways
[1:25:02] unexpected in terms of how we're
[1:25:05] thinking about it
[1:25:09] right
[1:25:11] remember that little example on sunday
[1:25:12] that i gave you the little sister was
[1:25:14] told by the lord
[1:25:16] don't fly home today stay in the stadium
[1:25:18] for this meeting there's going to be
[1:25:20] prayer and you're going to receive
[1:25:22] you're going to be the third one called
[1:25:24] what was her way of thinking about it
[1:25:26] same way you and i would have thought
[1:25:27] about it
[1:25:28] well that means i'm going to get prayer
[1:25:29] card number three
[1:25:34] but when it was said we're gonna start
[1:25:36] from
[1:25:37] the end which was at a hundred
[1:25:41] and we're going to come backwards
[1:25:44] right
[1:25:46] and here she had card number 97 the
[1:25:48] third one from it you you know what
[1:25:50] brother brandon is bringing out but her
[1:25:52] way of thinking about it our way of
[1:25:54] thinking about it
[1:25:56] she was a little discouraged but you
[1:25:58] know what she had to rest on god you
[1:26:00] told me to stay here
[1:26:03] now what i'm saying don't make sense but
[1:26:05] i'm surrendering my will to you what if
[1:26:08] that little lady would have just
[1:26:11] got all upset and said god you made me
[1:26:14] miss my plane lord jesus you made this
[1:26:17] happen lord and this
[1:26:20] see that's the difference between
[1:26:21] imagination and god speaking
[1:26:25] the bible said they that know their god
[1:26:27] shall do great exploits
[1:26:31] i tell you you're looking for great
[1:26:33] exploits one of the greatest exploits
[1:26:35] there is is to be equipped with the holy
[1:26:37] ghost and to overcome yourself daily
[1:26:42] hallelujah what greatness what
[1:26:44] mightiness what power to subdue your own
[1:26:48] reasoning subdue your own self and
[1:26:51] silence every voice
[1:26:57] [Music]
[1:26:59] god's got a way of doing it
[1:27:06] david would write about it
[1:27:08] in psalm 77 19 i'm trying to get there
[1:27:11] thy way is in the sea and thy path in
[1:27:13] the great waters and thy footsteps are
[1:27:16] not known
[1:27:18] in ecclesiastes 3 11 he hath made
[1:27:20] everything beautiful in his own time
[1:27:23] also he has set the world in their
[1:27:24] hearts so that no man can find out the
[1:27:27] work that god maketh from the beginning
[1:27:29] to the
[1:27:30] end can i read that one to you in the
[1:27:33] amplified
[1:27:35] he has made everything beautiful in his
[1:27:37] time he has also planted eternity in
[1:27:40] men's hearts and minds a divinely
[1:27:43] implanted sense of a purpose working
[1:27:46] through the ages which nothing under the
[1:27:48] sun but god alone can satisfy yet so
[1:27:51] that man cannot find out what god has
[1:27:54] done from the beginning to the end
[1:27:58] hallelujah doesn't it even amaze you in
[1:28:00] your own life of what god has done in
[1:28:03] your life and where he's brought you to
[1:28:05] right now
[1:28:07] you can't find it out
[1:28:11] his footsteps are unknown to the natural
[1:28:13] mind
[1:28:16] romans 11 33
[1:28:18] all the death of the riches both of the
[1:28:21] wisdom and knowledge of god how
[1:28:23] unsearchable are his judgments and his
[1:28:26] ways past finding out
[1:28:32] every promise
[1:28:34] god has made in his word
[1:28:36] he will perform it
[1:28:39] and god will answer it in his own way
[1:28:40] let me come back to the scriptures we've
[1:28:42] read for our text
[1:28:46] joshua comes there through prayer
[1:28:50] and you read in the scriptures
[1:28:52] joshua
[1:28:54] he goes towards that of the walls of
[1:28:56] jericho
[1:28:58] he's getting out to himself
[1:29:00] you know there's times in our life
[1:29:04] that we have to get along with god
[1:29:07] right
[1:29:09] and when i when we talk about that
[1:29:10] brother banham let's leave it in the
[1:29:12] scripture how the lord jesus would he
[1:29:14] went alone to pray and brother branham
[1:29:16] picks it up i believe in one of the
[1:29:17] blind bartimaeus messages and i quoted
[1:29:20] it here where he said there's every one
[1:29:21] three times he said where man just has
[1:29:23] to get off to himself and you know
[1:29:25] there's times where we're getting off to
[1:29:27] silence every other thought and every
[1:29:29] other voice and every other thing around
[1:29:31] and just to get alone and just to wait
[1:29:33] upon god
[1:29:35] because we don't always have the alone
[1:29:37] times like that
[1:29:39] are you hearing me
[1:29:41] we don't always have that but yet
[1:29:43] as believers
[1:29:45] we are always praying
[1:29:49] you're praying when you're on your job
[1:29:51] you're praying when you're driving in
[1:29:52] the car
[1:29:54] don't let prayer be
[1:29:56] something where you got to be on your
[1:29:57] knees
[1:29:59] because you can't limit it to a position
[1:30:01] of your body paul said stand praying
[1:30:04] david was laying prostrate right
[1:30:08] here we have this where paul said pray
[1:30:10] without ceasing praying always
[1:30:12] with all prayer and supplication
[1:30:17] so there's things that it's going to
[1:30:18] come see being in fellowship with the
[1:30:20] lord there's things that comes to your
[1:30:22] heart
[1:30:22] you know with my wife and i there there
[1:30:25] are the times where we sit down and
[1:30:27] sometimes we get to do that you know of
[1:30:29] a of an evening and just have our have
[1:30:31] our coffee together after we've ate
[1:30:32] dinner and things and just just to be
[1:30:34] able to talk but then there's other
[1:30:35] times that throughout the day and here
[1:30:37] and there that we kind of you know pass
[1:30:39] and say hey don't forget to make that
[1:30:41] announcement hey don't forget about this
[1:30:42] hey you have you taken care of this for
[1:30:45] for so and so schooling have you see
[1:30:47] those little things that have to be done
[1:30:48] that comes to her mind we come and talk
[1:30:49] about it right
[1:30:51] but those are things that that just need
[1:30:53] to be attended to but then there's times
[1:30:55] where we can just sit down and we just
[1:30:57] talk
[1:30:58] that's the same way it is with the lord
[1:31:01] there's things that comes to you
[1:31:02] throughout the day and it's quick
[1:31:03] sentences it's quick things that comes
[1:31:05] and maybe there's a prayer request maybe
[1:31:07] somebody comes on your heart lord be
[1:31:09] with brother joshua lord touch my
[1:31:10] brother strength of my brother and you
[1:31:12] go on there's things that god can bring
[1:31:14] to your heart you know being in tune
[1:31:15] with god god can bring things to your
[1:31:17] heart that things in your life that we
[1:31:19] need to die to and you can just simply
[1:31:22] say at that moment you might be putting
[1:31:23] on a not on on a screw at that time and
[1:31:26] say lord help me lord jesus you know
[1:31:29] what you're doing you're surrendering
[1:31:31] your will to his will
[1:31:33] if you can recognize who's there when
[1:31:36] you're doing that it's the same one that
[1:31:39] met joshua
[1:31:41] and your walk has invited
[1:31:44] him to reveal himself and say as leader
[1:31:48] as captain of the lord's house am i now
[1:31:52] come
[1:31:54] it's just that simple
[1:31:56] oh god help us to be that simple
[1:31:59] help us lord to live even from this
[1:32:01] moment on in that simplicity and
[1:32:03] recognizing and you know not beating
[1:32:05] yourself up in your mind about well i
[1:32:07] didn't have you know 45 minutes in the
[1:32:09] closet today or half we believe in times
[1:32:11] and getting away in prayer don't we all
[1:32:13] that needs to be but you understand i
[1:32:15] think god brought a very good example to
[1:32:17] us right here that we all can relate to
[1:32:19] and we do not have to walk around to
[1:32:21] feed it but to realize we have a
[1:32:23] relationship with an almighty god and
[1:32:26] he's ever present and right there at any
[1:32:29] time we are ready to talk to him
[1:32:31] as a matter of fact sometimes it just is
[1:32:33] a good time brother brian to say lord i
[1:32:35] love you
[1:32:37] lord i thank you lord things you begin
[1:32:39] to think about what the lord has done
[1:32:41] you say thank you lord

[1:32:46] why it's a relationship right there's
[1:32:48] times that for my wife when i see her in
[1:32:50] the house and i'm just saying honey i
[1:32:52] love you
[1:32:53] i might just be passing on out of the
[1:32:54] office going by to get another cup of
[1:32:56] coffee and you know just make a
[1:32:57] compliment and go ahead and go oh how
[1:32:59] much more is it with the lord jesus
[1:33:03] glory be to god now let me let me finish
[1:33:06] this part here in verse 14
[1:33:08] and joshua fell
[1:33:11] on his face
[1:33:14] to the earth
[1:33:16] and did worship
[1:33:18] and said unto him
[1:33:20] what saith
[1:33:21] my lord
[1:33:23] unto his servant
[1:33:25] if we can recognize it
[1:33:28] this
[1:33:29] is where the battle
[1:33:30] was won
[1:33:33] the battle was not won when the wall
[1:33:36] started coming down
[1:33:38] the battle
[1:33:39] was won
[1:33:40] when joshua recognized
[1:33:43] his position
[1:33:47] you're the leader
[1:33:48] you're the word and i'm your servant
[1:33:52] i might be the general of this army i
[1:33:53] might be the husband of this home i
[1:33:55] might be the pastor of the church i'm on
[1:33:57] and on
[1:33:58] but you're the leader of my life
[1:34:01] and that's where the victory was won you
[1:34:04] say well god hadn't even made known
[1:34:06] anything to joshua
[1:34:08] about the walls at that time
[1:34:11] that's true
[1:34:12] he hadn't made known to him this is how
[1:34:14] it's going to happen but the victory was
[1:34:17] won
[1:34:18] at that moment
[1:34:20] because
[1:34:22] he
[1:34:23] surrendered
[1:34:24] his will
[1:34:26] to the will of god
[1:34:30] and many say lord
[1:34:33] that's me i want it to be me lord
[1:34:36] i want to surrender my will in your
[1:34:38] presence
[1:34:41] heavenly father

[1:35:01] the how of it
[1:35:03] is being able lord
[1:35:06] to recognize your presence
[1:35:10] but lord i think of how that joshua he
[1:35:12] went

[1:35:21] may you
[1:35:23] so help each one of us
[1:35:26] as you've spoke to us so clearly lord
[1:35:28] that prayer is an ongoing

[1:35:44] out to seek
[1:35:46] for the way
[1:35:48] that you had planned to take it
[1:35:52] that at that moment you appeared to him
[1:35:55] and revealed yourself that i'm the
[1:35:57] leader

[1:36:35] of my ability lord that you have given
[1:36:37] me lord and i continue to submit it
[1:36:39] before you lord if there's anything

[1:47:43] amen
[1:47:45] thank you jesus

[1:47:57] that he's not a myth he's not a father
[1:47:59] amen
[1:48:17] him god would so
[1:48:19] divide himself
[1:48:22] into the lives of his children
[1:48:27] and you know that that place that he had
[1:48:29] reserved for himself
[1:48:32] even though that belonged to him that
[1:48:35] seed on the inside it belonged to him
[1:48:39] but he cannot override
[1:48:41] and he did not override
[1:48:43] our own will that's right but he had to
[1:48:47] work on us through his
[1:48:49] loving kindness
[1:48:51] to where our
[1:48:52] self will
[1:48:54] would match his will
[1:48:56] and when our self will matches his will
[1:49:00] that's when death to self comes that's
[1:49:02] the mystery of death to self when our
[1:49:04] will becomes his will
[1:49:08] then
[1:49:09] his will his life
[1:49:12] comes into us
[1:49:14] and you begin to realize
[1:49:16] truly all things have become new
[1:49:19] lord i i'm just looking to you for your
[1:49:21] leadership you've got a confidence a
[1:49:23] comfort in him to know he's my guide
[1:49:27] he'll never leave me anywhere that he's
[1:49:28] not big enough to take care of me
[1:49:31] he'll guide me and direct me in every
[1:49:32] part of my life
[1:49:35] all that his purpose is to be fulfilled
[1:49:37] in my life
[1:49:38] amen he'll guide me you know there's a
[1:49:40] trust that's called faith that comes
[1:49:42] about in our life
[1:49:44] and you know what it is it's god
[1:49:46] operating
[1:49:49] through that part
[1:49:51] in us
[1:49:52] that's really
[1:49:54] him that part in us
[1:49:57] that's really him
[1:50:00] because what does it display
[1:50:02] him
[1:50:04] what does a son or daughter do
[1:50:08] with the same you display the attributes
[1:50:09] of sean derek your grandfather and on

[1:50:25] it's there within your dna yes amen how
[1:50:28] much more
[1:50:30] for a son and daughter of god
[1:50:32] it's not in our natural dna
[1:50:35] it's in that spiritual dna on the inside
[1:50:38] amen and so when the holy spirit begins
[1:50:40] to energize and come upon that
[1:50:43] then it's no longer i that liveth it's
[1:50:45] christ
[1:50:47] it's him reflecting his own life
