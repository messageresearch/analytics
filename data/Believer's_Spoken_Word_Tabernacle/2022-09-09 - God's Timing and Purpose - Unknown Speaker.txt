[Music] i'll see [Music] hallelujah what a what a wonderful reality safe in the haven of rest so so precious to us man more and more each passing moment we just as we prepare to turn our hearts to the word of the lord tonight uh we want to continue to remember the walker family prayer god would just continue to minister to them and all the extended family all that are around and that god would just comfort them and i just say it in this way when we were on our way home when i received the news and we could get everything rounded up and on our way home there on monday i want to say thank you for your prayers for the services there the lord just the lord had his way and we just thank god for that and so i want to just give you the greetings from there and also to say thank you for your prayers because we came home here on monday and just looking upon everything and with the family and just knowing that on our way home benjamin was listening to the service here from sunday you know god has he's so mindful and one of the clips that benjamin had he just he locked onto it and he began to play it in the car we must have played it two three times and it was a time where the lord just took brother brother nathan really dealt with the part of because you know they've been through some real tragedies there that of how that we don't always we don't understand when things take place and but just to see and just to hear the comfort of the holy spirit to give us a direction to know that in everything god's got a purpose prophet would take us into the word and let us know that god's not the author of frustration he's the author of peace and so when we begin to just think of those things and just to meditate on it there's no way that you know as a as an individual that we have we have answers for these things god has answers but we we know that we know that god's ways god's ways are perfect it's perfect so i just just just feeling led of the lord i'm just gonna take some different services and just to just to minister on certain things that the lord just pressing on my heart with certain things that are present also things that we look at and i just want to just we just want to give ourselves to him because if there's anything in the midst of this moment and every moment of our life he's our strength it doesn't matter what we face we can't face one day without him i don't care how good that i may feel i have it together you may feel you have it together i don't want to face it on my own no matter when i feel like i'm on the mountain or i feel like i'm in the valley or i feel like a situation in front of me that seems like everything's covered or when i don't we need him at all times david would write there in psalms 27 i think it's so fitting for the the hour that we're living in brother branham would be led to take that as a text for the rapture i'm sure that probably like even most of us at first would wonder why didn't why didn't the prophet take first thessalonians 4 for the text why didn't he take first corinthians 15. but when brother branham reads psalms 27 he says i'm going to give a background for this setting of the rapture i think how david opens in that first part the lord is the strength of my life you know that's the real height we we we speak of the capstone coming down and the mind of christ has set down upon the bride of jesus christ but to see that the the essence of that maturing in our life it brings god bringing us to the realization that he's the strength of our life that there's there's one holding me not me holding him and that's that's the that's the that's the that's the real climax of the maturity when we're being captured by that then god can work because he's the strength of my life we just want to remember the family in prayer i want to there'll be emails coming out i didn't want to send out the email the other night when we sent out that other one i just regarding arrangements but the arrangements will be on tuesday wednesday of next week and so we'll get those out to you tuesday will be the viewing wednesday will be the service and uh there's also a dinner that's with that we're going to put on for for their family friends there on wednesday so all those details will be coming out to you perhaps some of you already have those details but we'll be getting those out to you i also want to have a request have a request as we prepare to go into prayer i just heard received from brother alexander magoulas with alexander very very precious brother and you i called him very quickly when he was just coming out of prayer he had been having some he'd text me before he'd been having some things with that no with cardio or with the uh not cardio but with his uh thought might possibly be his heart and so forth and uh sure enough today his main artery was 99 blocked and they just put a stint in the other one they're going to do the other one on another day it's 70 percent and i told him i said brother brother alexander i said i know you know this i said but these are just things i'm pouring across right now i said the reality is god can't take you it can't be taken satan can't touch you until god's finished and just think of all of these things i you know i just we were just fellowshipping there on the phone of how that god helped us to be sensitive god allowed him to uh was about a year ago year and a half ago because brother jason watkins was actually in the same situation on a saturday evening he didn't want to go to the doctor and so forth and family pressured sure enough if brother jason hadn't win at that time brother jason watkins wouldn't have been with us same same thing brother alexander was just sharing that with me and so he's he's doing really well and he just was we were talking on the phone and uh so he just asked me to greet you and uh so he's doing really well and we just want to continue to remember him in prayer know truly it's a real comfort to know that our lives are in his hands it's in his hands everything god directing us influences even see when i look at that with brother jason and brother alexander being down there at that moment and being able to talk to brother jason that helped to alert brother alexander when he began to feel certain things preaching and he just felt like i can't i can't even get this thought out not able to mow his grass and things like that god allowed that and sometimes we we look at things and i'll say weak as i say i'm saying all of us and we don't realize the providential hand of almighty god that god is allowing things to be our paths to cross we're not here by accident we say that a lot but it's a truth it wasn't by accident that god allowed that to be heard by brother alexander from brother jason watkins because brother alexander shared with me says this as far as heart trouble runs on both sides of my family says and they've got family members that have died very young we thank god for his grace i just pray lord help us each and every one to just be more just just more yielded more sensitive and just because knowing that our lives you're directing our paths even when it's not even about our health it could be about a job it could be about god allows you to be in the certain places at the right time to hear the certain things we're we're i understand you we look at one another and we see one another as being yeah we're flesh but really what you see the flesh the flesh is only the screen that the attribute displays itself it's god moving an orchestra everything and i just gotta help us just to be that sensitive also sister linda cavill she she's there in the hospital they wanted to do some tests and you know she was they were concerned uh but yet it's what it is it's uh been a little bit of a reaction to a medication and that she's had and so there she's doing very well she's been doing well but with that little bit and then they're going to move her into uh from the hospital then to rehab and she's it just was just just speaking with her she's doing very well and so just ask that you would just continue remember her in prayer that god will just continue to give her strength amen and also brother bobby carper that would just continue to remember him in prayer forgive me if these are redundant if it's already been mentioned i didn't i just didn't hear it but brother bobby just remember the lord will just continue to give him strength he's he gets where brother bobby gets kind of blocked up and he just he needs he needs a touch from the lord it's it's this time has probably been the worst that's what he says he said it's the worst that he's ever been in so we just just want to ask the lord to continue to touch him because sister michelle's also you know coming through that of the knee surgery and she's been able to get around and things but we just want to remember them in prayer and i know there's many other needs in the body that are here in present so if we could let's just stand and let's go to the lord in a word of prayer before we turn to the word let's just pray together heavenly father lord jesus we know that lord that we're never out of order when we come before the throne of god in prayer lord we come lord in that precious all-sufficient name of our sacrifice our redeemer our savior the lord jesus christ lord you who made a way for us lord that we might approach the throne of grace lord with boldness with the confidence that we might obtain help lord in the time of trouble lord we're we're depending on you lord you see the needs lord that is here before us dear god we're father the walker family lord oh god this lord's situation this lord a tragedy lord what has taken place lord but i ask that god that you just lord continue to comfort them lord you're the one who came there lord that evening lord on monday evening you came in the room lord and father we ask that you'll just continue lord just to make your presence known many words lord we that lord but it's your presence your presence lord it says more than any words could ever say we just ask that god that you'll just move lord for every need for every situation brother alexander how we thank you god for lord our brother and lord for he and sister maria and the family we ask that god as we thank you lord that you've worked everything lord into the place that our brother lord he received the help lord in his body that was needed lord and lord it's you that that has brought healing to him and i pray that god that you'll just continue to strengthen him lord and refreshing there oh god granted lord for we need him lord we appreciate his ministry and his labor of love oh god we pray father for sister linda that you'll just continue to move for her lord though the enemy lord has wanted to come with setback after setback but there's something greater i think of that little fountain that lord your prophet would ask why are you bubbling and that fountain could declare there is a force behind me and lord jesus we pray that god you'll just continue to strengthen her lord strengthen her in her spirit and in her mind and in her body oh god and lord jesus for brother bobby lord that you'll just lord continue to move for him in a very special way lord may you bring a release in his body o god and i pray that lord you'll just move for him lord move down and just touch him lord just one touch from you lord is all that's needed lord would you just go lord to our brother tonight lord minister to his body right now father we ask it lord and i said you'll just help us lord as we look into your word we just lord desire just to be directed by you father we give you the praise on our glory in jesus name amen and amen amen let's turn in their bibles to luke 24. i'm just going to just read here from a few verses of scripture we'll begin at verse 13. i know your place of reading say thank you musicians luke 24 verse 13. the bible says and behold two of them went that same day to a village called emmaus which was from jerusalem about three score furlings and they talked together of all these things which had happened and it came to pass that while they communed together and reasoned jesus himself drew near and went with him but their eyes were holding that they should not know him and he said unto them what manner of communications are these that you have one to another as you walk and are sad and the one of them whose name was colloquius answering said unto him art thou only a stranger in jerusalem and hast thou not known the things which are come to pass therein these days and he said unto them what things they said unto him concerning jesus of nazareth which was a prophet mighty indeed and word before god and all the people and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and have crucified him but we trusted that it had been he that should have redeemed israel beside all this today is the third day since these things were done yea and certain women also of our company made us astonished which were early at the sepulcher when they found not his body they came saying they had also seen a vision of angels which said that he was alive and certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre and found it even so as the women had said they found but they saw him not then he said unto them o fools and soul of heart to believe all the prophets have spoken ought not christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory may god bless the reading of the word bless you as you're being seated i just i want to just speak just a few moments here this evening on a little thought on god's timing and purpose god's timing and purpose many times that we're looking at things that we know that in every promise that god has made in his word god an allotted time just like when it comes down to our own lives there's an allotted time and so when we recognize that that there's things that as we see within this passage of scripture that here the lord jesus is walking he comes and he draws near cleopas and the other disciple and they are they're communicating and they're sad regarding the situations that have just taken place they can't explain nor do they understand what has happened and but yet as they commune together and they reasoned within themselves now there's no doubt about it that what they were as they didn't understand that questions were there because it's evident by the scriptures but how that they could have been able to rehearse of just the the things that they had seen being done in the ministry of the lord jesus and they just trying to put all this together as we read in the scriptures we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed israel and little did they know that's exactly what was taking place but when he came this is what's important is that he came and he drew near that's what made the difference when they were talking about all of this he came and he drew near that's that's what made all the difference in the world if he hadn't come to them there there never would have come forth any understanding within that present situation they would have been left brother branham re speaks of this we can see it in the scripture and how the spirit of god goes in to pull out the where that the people were at that moment they were in a state of bewilderment it was just as though that when things took place and how everything was a prophet mighty in word indeed they're witnessing him walking on the water they witnessed marvelous miraculous things being done that is not of of any earthly or human power but they knew it had to be almighty god and then to see something transpired that they themselves could not explain but yet in the midst of it and we understand that part with with the explaining and trying to understand because we as human beings we are always prone to seek for the why we're always sometimes we can become caught up with because our flesh always wants to escape at trial we always want to escape heartache or anything that would take away from us you know we look and say man if i would have done this i wouldn't have had that bill man if i'd have done this i we're always we're always looking to try to to escape that that's it doesn't matter where you you know in our lives of of being filled with the spirit of god there's still that flesh realm about it that the flesh realm does not want to suffer it doesn't want to do that and these are things that we we see within ourselves when we can still recognize in that part that this this this as jesus could say that the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak we are prone as human beings always to want to figure things out and sometimes we if we could have looked at things and i'm not saying sometimes things don't happen with choices and decisions but when you step back sometimes we look at things and we're trying to say well if we would have done this if so-and-so would have done this if we'd had done this and this wouldn't have happened and this wouldn't happen and listen let's just from from all from this back wall all the way clear that back wall and whatever covers on the internet we're all prone to that and we look at what could we have done to prevent it and sometimes there's there's just things that you realize that it wasn't something that we could prevent but god just gives us grace to go through it just no other way to explain that but there's still a part for us that we we seek to understand certain events this is what was taking place there to understand and we sometimes we're strive we perplexed to know why and yet you know this is something that we can all agree is that even in some situations that can be so tragic that even if we understood the why it would not remove the hurt you wouldn't i think right across here i just my mind begin to just i was just thinking throughout you know the course of um of the days here and just even on my way home and just looking at different things and i just you know i'm no doubt just like the rest of you just was in i was felt numb i was in a shock with everything and i'm just i'm just thinking and i'm reflecting uh upon so many different things that right here within of the assembly that sometimes we we could and i don't want to say that we forget but just sometimes when you step back and you begin to reflect on on this one and this tragic situation and this situation happened and this situation i mean i don't want to go into call events because some of you may not uh remember some of those events but where other young people have been other young ones that were very young that in a very tragic way things took place and things happened and i remember in those things because i had to do this i was also doing some of the funerals within those times and remembering that here in the in the assembly remembering working and ministering to different ones and i just you know when we look at everything the thing that we want in every situation we're looking to draw comfort from the lord because in everything that we can do there's a place where we can draw strength and we can draw comfort from him because though we would understand a situation and we don't it doesn't remove the hurt it doesn't remove the reality that we need his comfort we need his comfort when jesus when jesus through paul could speak and say that we mourn not as others mourn he never said that we don't mourn because paul said we weep with those who weep with though remembering them that are in bonds as you your suffering bonds remember them that are in adversity as yourself or in adversity paul is bringing it in that the body feels hurt when one hurts we all hurt when one rejoices we all rejoice we're not we've not been paralyzed we've not been numbed we is to be sensitive because god has placed it that way that there's a love and a care for one another to pray for one another and i know i know throughout this assembly we're in contact with different ones i've got on on on here i've got different threads where i'm in contact with different uh some some you know some pastors here and other mission threads here and other this and i've got all this and you're hearing the requests come in from nigeria you have a request come in from switzerland and it's all over the you know having different requests come in and you look at the requests sometimes and things that are coming but yet you don't know all those requests those are things that you know that might come to my attention but you know god has placed us here and it's not that we're not mindful of other needs we are and it will come to us as we lift it up in prayer but god has brought us together in a manner just like in your household that you're observant of the care and needs that's present sometimes there's things that are not even said but you're observant you just feel a burn you know maybe i just in this point right here to minister to my wife or to minister to my husband sometimes that part of ministry doesn't have anything to do with saying anything only being present and just saying lord just let me be an instrument if we understood everything and we knew everything then we wouldn't need faith but faith itself is the results of love and we trust him even when we don't understand that's difficult even for a believer born of the spirit of god let alone someone that's without the lord jesus it's not when i say difficult because our flesh our part is prone within that but there's something that rises within us that's greater than our humanity it's it's got to be there something that's greater than our humanity when brother banham stood there here his wife has been taken to the morgue now he stands there before his little daughter there had to be something brighter and greater than branham dna it's greater than that it's not it wasn't brand on dna that god had done it was the dna of almighty god that stood up in the meantime that when he said i was about ready to say but it rose up within him this is why job could say in the midst of his trying moment i just want you to these i know we we quote these words a lot but just just let him minister to us job said in job 13 15 though he slay me who's the part that was being slayed was it the attribute of god was it the gene of god that was being slayed no because if that's being slayed then you have god being slave though he slay me yet will i trust him so there's a me that is experiencing these things but there's an eye that rises in the midst of it and says i will trust him there's our flesh that experiences these things that where job had the loss and had the boils but there's a part that rises in the midst of a yay i will trust him because it's through that entrusting in him that brings stability and gives us to say god's got all of this and i'm gonna look to him what a testimony job said but i will maintain mine own ways before him psalm 62 verse 8 trust in him at all times poor people poor you people pour out your heart before him god is a refuge for us trust in him at all times psalms 141 25 verse 1 just to share a few of these that just press on my heart they that trust in the lord shall be as mount zion which cannot be removed but abideth forever all of this we're speaking of it's not about oh brother you know if you if you really had it you wouldn't be weeping what what what are you talking about this is not glorified sometimes people can come with those types of things and then what happens is when they go through something well come on you see what i'm saying but we recognize this right here this flesh is weakness this is susceptible to get down when i'm talking about flesh you understand i'm talking about spirit and mind all of those things within it it's susceptible to all that that's why we have to battle through that is that right so it's not there's times we can get weary you can feel paul said when he was surrounded by things he said we had fears within and without so the part that's unmovable is that part that never you cannot change a believer from being a believer to an unbeliever because you've been made you have been ordained to believe and the spirit of god has raised you up and even though you can't i can't explain it and even though our surroundings might be shattered around us but it cannot cannot remove a believer from his god i say praise be to god for that and paul could say i'm persuaded he's able to keep that which i've committed unto him against that day hallelujah because we want to want to glory in in the lord because it's him it's not us they that trust in the lord shall be as mount zion which cannot be removed but abideth forever trust in the lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding isaiah 26 3 i i love this scripture that will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusteth in thee trust ye in the lord forever for in the lord jehovah is everlasting strength let me just give you a little background this scripture ties into where we stand as the bride of jesus christ receiving the ministry here in the end time israel is to receive her visitation and these scriptures when they surround jerusalem these scriptures will be part of the manifestation that will be their strength when the armies are surrounding jerusalem and have come down there remember this is where this setting is in this scripture to see all of them that surround it now that's not the first time it's ever happened in israel that happened you remember in the time of uh cenerechev when he came down there but the point was is that god will have his word the holy spirit assembling his people and there will be those two witnesses that will stand there and those 144 will be baptized with the spirit of god brother samuel what he's saying i'm saying that it will be the thoughts of god that are present and being spoken in that hour that will override and give strength to all of the surrounding things david said though a host [Music] which it wouldn't encompass about me it's the same setting we don't have natural army surrounding us but every demonic force is surrounding what is it that gives you an eye perfect peace what is it it's the lord jesus even as we come to the house of god and you're praying and you know our daily walk with god we are receiving strength from almighty god i'm grateful that there is help that we can receive from god from one through one another to where there are thoughts of god that are spoken that give us strength we can take a hold of that thought you know what i'll do it'll cast out other thoughts that's what's powerful because these thoughts listen paul paul wouldn't know about having an insight wherefore regarding this of the rapture wherefore comfort ye one another with these words certainly not anything else that's going on certainly not anything else we could mention a few things about this or that stock market or more no comfort are you hearing me but in the words of the lord there is comfort to the believer and may i say it like this sometimes it's not even in the part that you have to say anything because you also are the word made flesh sometimes it's the word made flesh just being present that'll stabilize and help and allow the spirit of god to come and minister in a situation so don't ever feel like oh i gotta have words to say and i gotta no sometimes it's just what needs to be is the word made flesh in you and me god help us name 1 7 the lord is good a stronghold in the day of trouble and he knoweth them that trust in him that trust in him you know what trust is it's when i don't know i don't understand and it's at all times trust in the lord at all times even when i can see things it looks like this is unfolding but when it's really important is is when i don't know what's going on even as young people when you can say i don't know what the next day hold i don't know what the next year holds but i can trust in you lord jesus i can trust in your leadership they can say what they want about or the job they're going to close this they're going to do that but you can say lord i trust in you i don't you know if i look at it i could say in my natural mind this is not possible this how could this be how could that be how can this work out oh surely this is they're going to close this or surely this is going to happen but as a believer we step back and say wait a minute i'm not going to concern myself like david said with things that are bigger than me i'm going to trust the lord david said with thoughts that are higher than me that's beyond me because you can look and say god put me here i didn't put myself here god put me here i didn't open this door god opened this door dosed for me to try to say how is this going to be it how is that going to be let's fellowship around this we're prone to that our human part is prone to that because of what does it do it kicks in for a manner of self-preservation but on the inside there's that which rises up and says lord i don't understand i don't know how but i trust you and that's greater that's greater than if we did know trust is greater than if we did know second corinthians 5 7 we walk by faith and brother branham talks about a symphony and we know that with a symphony there's there's changes somebody has composed that piece of music and there's changes in it there's a beginning part to it and probably every one of us have either been or watched viewed a symphony or a symphony brother brandon where he would relay it as a symphony tied in where there's a drama being acted out on stage and you refer to peter and the wolf and how that sometimes there's no speaking parts it's just simply what's happening you know like when the is it peter no yeah the wolf is coming up and they played that they didn't know there's certain notes that are incorporated that let you know something is at hand some sort of event where you're just like oh you know where you're looking what is it it's the music that gives you that indication and the composer when the composer who wrote that piece he so incorporated it that there would be highs and low there would be mid the mid-range notes all of those notes would harmoniously together because it's like on a piano if all we played was high notes it wouldn't the song wouldn't have the beauty if you played only low notes on a piano the song would not have the beauty but it's having the blend of all the notes high notes little low notes the mid-range all those things coming together that just where you and i sometimes can sit back and say man that is a beautiful piece of music but in order for it to be a piece of music it's got to have eyes and it's got to have lows that's how it is with our lives this is exactly how there's changes that happen brother van talks about the changes that have happened he said in the gospel of how god has had it so laid out in this great peace that he has composed that his inspiration that mood remember the bible said that the prophets were moved by the spirit of god and they came under the influence of the divine composer and they would begin to put this high note and then they would begin to go down to the bass clef and they would put this note in right here and then they would go up to this one and put this one in and this would be placed in and and there's only one that can bring about those the the the notes and that's the same one his inspiration that it would come down upon the director that's present at that time and there are hearts and lives that that are are captivated under that on by that of of of the inspiration of the hour and they're looking into that and here the director is just it's simply inspiration moving down just like it was in the days of luther when luther came under that inspiration of the just shall live by faith it was a part in the sheet music and and there were those who were locked in ordained to hear that and it wasn't them it was the grace of god that reached out and that inspiration what god had in his mind it caught hold and it reflected in her life so what the music sheet was saying the inspiration was reflecting and acting out in the lives of the people and that's the same way as it as it continued on down and on through but yet within the midst of every one of those junctions and those changes every life goes through even in its own part the ups the downs every one of our lives when david would write many are the afflictions of the righteous but the lord delivereth them out of them all and this is where when brother braham is talking about the changes of the music sheet now listen as he says this he says let us follow with the rhythm of the word whatever the music beats for that hour beat with it many people asked why they asked sometimes they asked me why why must these things happen why did this happen to me why did i start and this happened and i had this trouble here and this upset me here and i lost this here it's natural can i say this right here god doesn't get frustrated with questions are you hearing me they communed and reasoned together but you know what he drew near they couldn't understand but when they were looking at everything and there was he drew near and when you and i there's these questions that we have it's not like oh oh you've asked why you're a sinner that's nonsense there's times where we it sometimes can come out it can come out why i i don't you know and you know you know it's not you're questioning god but sometimes you you look at things you might think i don't understand this i don't understand that but see that's why there's something greater inside of our life that though we cannot explain it i can't understand it but like job said though he slayed me yet will i trust him brother look what brother braham said sometimes i've asked why sometimes i've asked why why when i was just a young minister and first started out did god take my wife right out from under me take my baby right from beneath me right beneath my heart why did he do that i don't know i do now see all the time he says i don't i didn't know but i do now now brother braham will talk about in 1951 where there's an understanding that's coming to him but i want you to see this is a powerful statement that he makes here i didn't know i do now i just held my hand in his and kept trusting i don't understand why that he took my wife why he undertook why he took my baby i mean wouldn't think of it would it make sense to you or to me i don't every time i've went through that of the life story and i read you know brother owen jurgeson's the supernatural books and i hear brother brown talk about it and grips your heart and i always remember brother herb keithley said he said anytime he said i feel like i've got a hard trial i feel like i'm going through a hard time he said brother samuel you know what i do he says i put on the life story he said i realized god forgive me for complaining i don't got no problems at all he knew how to he knew how to approach it but you know how brother graham talks about think about it billy being just so so small still having a bottle you you and i would look at it and say but god it doesn't make sense he needs a mother i'm just being real brother braham said he didn't understand it he didn't know why but this is what he said this is what brought him through i kept my hand in his hand and i just kept trusting what are we doing we're keeping our hand in his hand and we keep trusting i don't know i don't understand everything i don't have an explanation but i'm gonna keep my hand in his hand and i'm just gonna trust him when they think of the sister we were praying for out of brother mike wall's church here last monday knew that that was that was coming you know and she went on home to be with the lord when i say knew what was coming we knew there i knew i knew at the time they'd asked us to pray the text had come in across the thread the ministers asked us to pray and think that was since the first of august remember i mentioned that two years of congregation the sister just gave birth to their third child she never saw the child brothers which which should have been you had you had brothers it's it's you know you you're just encouraging you're standing in prayer brother mike we're praying we're in in the churches and all around people we're praying and you stop and look at it because it's these statements were made before everything we don't know what god's decision is even in this here our minds cannot fathom that part of it we would look and say that baby needs a mother that husband needs a wife and a mother to care for those children but i mean what explanation is it i don't have one the only thing i can say is is god is perfect in all his ways we sing a song here but i think it's more than just a song we'll understand it better by and by hallelujah i i don't know i just just you know within these things so notice there's highs and lows and all of this blends together in ecclesiastes 3 1 it says to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven i could go through and read those down through verse 8 but i won't for sake of time david said my times are in thy hand my times there's as job could write and say in job 14 5 speaking of that the fragileness of this life it doesn't matter how where a person might be at no matter from where they're in youth middle and it doesn't matter this life is so fragile it's so fragile it's so fragile and joe could write of a man who's born of a woman is a few days old and feel full of trouble and he writes it in this way he says seeing his days are determined and the number of months are with thee and thou has appointed his bounds that he cannot pass and i just want to say it in this manner god's timing and his purpose is precise we don't understand it but it's precise there's a lot of things that we like i said we don't understand brother brown was saying in his own part let me go into a part that just was on my heart the lord just placed it on my heart here the other day brother brown's out on a meeting and he comes back in from a meeting there is a he's describing the setting of the situation where he says there was a family that had come to the tabernacle from kentucky he said they had come there for years he said they were fine people good friends of mine real friends of mine he said but he said they were just one of those kind of people that when a revival was going on they would come to church but when the revival was off and the load was pulling nobody would pull and all the children was here on the crater wall and we had our classes and things and i i said that because brother brown said it for a background for things that he'll mention within this situation and brother branham so he's he's given us that situation here and he says i come home one day from a meeting and here was a young girl he said she had been here on the cradle roll sunday school and so forth when she was eight years old and things she was married had two children she was laying out in the hospital at this at this time at the point of death and she had she had uh had a baby that was four or five months old but that baby had died it was within her it had died within her and they couldn't operate to take the baby out because she had uremic poisoning because it oh they were they couldn't operate so they were going to have to let the mother die too brother graham said i went out to see her because she sent for me he raised up the oxygen tent do you remember me sure brother bill i remember you do you understand sister how sick you are she said i do that's why i sent for you i said well how how is it with you and the lord brother bill i'm not ready to the gram said we got down in the room and her mother and her husband and them we started crying she got right with god she paid her vows come back and make god the promise if she'd be forgiven how she loved him sorry for her sins the way she had lived and she went on with her repentance and crying after a while i got up and went out of the building the next morning he said they called me and they come in that morning to do a test to see how the uremic condition had advanced and found out she didn't have a spec it was all gone every bit of the uremic poison had left and the doctors were so excited they said wow this is this is so very strange tomorrow morning we're gonna if it's still this way in the morning we're going to operate and take the dead baby out so they were given her penicillins and things like that to keep infection down and but rem said through that same day they tested her about two or three more times nothing was wrong no uremic poisoning nothing and they prepped her for that for that surgery part of the prepping was taking her out of the oxygen tent brother braham said everything was fine they were going to operate the next morning brahman said i never knew it he said the lord never told me anything brother brahm said he here here he was going into the room and her husband he being a sinner come over to me and he said brother branham i want to give my life to the lord jesus you see there's an effect that's being had her husband he's he was crying with her but now this next day he says i want to give my life to the lord jesus but rem said all right he said let's kneel down here you take your wife's hands and you walk this straight life together then the mother came back to him and brother brahma you know here's me and my children we've been in and out and in and out of the tabernacle and things and we sit and listen that you preach and we'll go up to the altar and we'd come back and said i'm backslid too brother branham said i want to come back to the lord jesus for his goodness to my child abraham said that's very nice but you don't come to the lord jesus because of that so the husband you know he really i'm a sinner i need to i want to give my life to the lord but the mother was saying i just want to i want to i want to rededicate my life because of his goodness to my daughter the brand said that's not a reason that's not a reason notice you say well brother samuel what's the reason the reason is is to recognize because that brother branham was is pointing out that ain't gonna hold that ain't gonna hold what to recognize is it's giving your life to him you know you can give your life to a church and that's all you've done but he came that we might have life is to give our life to him so about midnight that same night the the daughter she calls her and she called her mother over she said well honey what do you want she said mama what do you want honey she said you know she said i'm so happy she said i'm glad you're being happy he said mama i'm at peace with god and oh how fine it is she said mother mama said yes she said i'm going home mama said i know you are yes sweetheart the doctor is they're gonna take the baby tomorrow and about a day or two your incisions heal up and you get away from here and you get back home and you'll be happy again you and your hubby and little children be a christian live for god she said mother i mean i'm going to my heavenly home i'm going to my heavenly home she said sure honey at the end of the journey she said mama this is the end of the journey oh she said now now what what what's the matter mama said that the end of the journey he said yes mother within a few minutes i'll be gone well mama thought she had been nervous and delirious so the nurse came in and took all the you know the respiration and everything brother bran said everything was normal within five minutes of that moment she was gone she was dead brother branham was out on a meeting and so he comes back and he finds out that brother graham snelling had preached the girl's funeral brother brown got them you know he got the information from sister meaty the girl had died i want you to watch what brother brown says here he says i don't know what caused me to do it but i said lord god you owe me an understanding lord god you owe me an understanding after me now here's what he's basing it on you owe me an understanding after me going out there telling that husband and him coming to the lord after you've done these things for him and all like that and then take the girl's life like that you owe me an understanding brahma said when you tell god something like that he'll leave you sitting alone you don't owe me nothing i'm in debt to him he let me pout it out for a few days think of this three or four months later finally god answers him about this and the lord spoke to him in vision and said this is what i want you to do i want you to go to her mother and i want you to say this to her mother did not her time come the year before that when she was drowning in a creek on a picnic i'm talking about the young lady who passed with the baby on the inside did not her time come the year before that she should have went at that time this is the lord talking but i had to take her when she was ready to go i had to take her when she was ready to go and that's why all this happened and why you went out there but bram said i got down and i cried i said lord jesus forgive your poor stupid servant i should never have said that lord he went down the street and he talked to the mama he said i got to ask you a question sure brother bill is it true that this girl your daughter almost drowned she said that's right brother branham she said they had to give her artificial respiration when they finally pulled her out of the creek it was on a picnic and her dress had went up around and she couldn't get up through all of that and and they had to give her artificial respiration to even bring her back at that moment brother brown said that was her time to go and then brother branham ends it this way he says see god knows what he's doing think of it you see in our without that part brother adam was looking just as you and i would look at it here is a young mother that finally that she was in a family that was in and out of the tabernacle when things were going good and revival was there they were in church and then eventually just cool off and go away and they were in and out in and out and that's what that's all she had seen but then in this moment god allowed this situation think of it when she drowned like that she never called for brother branham i wonder brother bran don't go into this whether or not they came back to church for a period of time after she drowned he doesn't tell us that i don't know that maybe if i talk maybe if i would have known about all this i could have talked to some of the brothers i was with this past weekend and asked him a little bit of background on some of this maybe i could have called him up before tonight but anyhow god didn't it wasn't necessary the point is at this moment something changed in her life to where she was ready it wasn't just coming to church that made her ready it wasn't being around the branham tabernacle that made her ready it wasn't knowing god sent a prophet that made her ready what made her ready is to receive the preparation that the lord jesus had already made she had to receive and repent and lay down her life it took an awful long time how old that she was as a young mother with two children let alone this one that already passed within her womb and the husband you would think in this moment lord here they are they're going to serve you together as a husband and wife the husband was led to the lord but god's timing and his purpose are perfect if we could talk to that husband i don't know whatever became but let's just say we could talk to that husband no doubt probably standing on the other side by now i would assume at any rate if we could have asked that husband at that moment would you would you have desired your wife to stay here who wouldn't have you think it didn't tear him up but then once could you imagine once coming on to the other side and then recognizing god allowed that to draw and reconcile those hearts to him brother braham didn't understand it didn't make sense to him just like a lot of things don't make sense to us but in the midst of it may we keep our hand in his hands and keep trusting because we don't know all that god is doing and will do even even in this situation that has come about and there's other i said there's been others other situations before that i won't go in but out of it sometimes you have no idea we have no idea we may not know till we get to the other side of the effect but i just say god let me just keep my hand in here it's one thing as a pastor there's only one place i can point you to and take you to and point you to that great source of comfort and that's the lord jesus he's the one that he's the one that's got us through hard times tough times before he's the one that's brought us through we didn't bring ourselves through even when we didn't feel like he was near he said standing in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks i know i'll never leave you nor forsake you and it's his presence that comes comes among us it's him that has brought us safe this far and he will take us safely home the same god that has brought healing in our lives of things of questions that we could have but in the midst of it with every question we have to place it into into his hands and say god i trust you i trust you lord jesus that's who we're looking to i don't know what i don't know what all that god will do out of this i don't know i don't even try to i don't even if just like with every other situation i've always looked at in this way lord i don't know all but i know you're in control i know you're in control and i think as i just i i'm just to make this statement here was here was ryan walker just months ago things i remember seeing different pictures so forth but back in august of 2020 we got done minute we were finished ministering a meeting and right here and my family and i were taking right out on that sunday right afterwards and as i pull up to our destination i look down and i have a little text i have a text now i don't know who it is but he had to he alerted me to who it was he said brother samuel this is ryan walker i need to speak he said the lord's been dealing with my life and i want to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ so went out away from the family and just began to talk to him and talk as we conversed and you know we couldn't baptize him right here in august because they were working on the baptistery so in between that time he said when i get i you know he really wanted before he went to college and he said when i come home on a break he says when i get home he said i want a break he said at any time you let me know well you know it was a little bit working on this we finally had it and sister rebecca his sister and zachary were baptized the first part of october long story short when he comes home for christmas break i'm just going to be real okay sometimes you you look you you know that when a person has made it repented we prayed together there on the phone and even where he was already he said brother samuel at that point in august of 2020 he said god has been dealing with my heart since january of 2012. so it wasn't a coveted conviction are you hearing me now he said since january god's been dealing with my heart so then right here in december of 2020 the 27th we baptized him in the name of the lord jesus christ he went to college and i told different ones of the young people i had them i alerted right away i learned brother shane i said stay in contact with this young man just think i'll be in contact with stay in contact we just come right up we come surround them just staying in contact with them different ones and so here we have it every time you knew when brother ryan was on break from school he said how do you know that because you seen him if it was thursday wednesday you saw him he was sitting right back there right next to brother drake or between or on the other side of sister rebecca he was here this past summer he came home he got to be home here in may for one once one service i don't even know if it was two services he had an internship in maryland he really didn't want to go but he went for the internship as part of the school then he comes home and on that thursday when he came home so he's been away the whole time now thursday he comes home he comes forward and he comes forward for prayer and he says brother samuel he said i just want prayer before i go back to college that god will just be with me guide me through college and just help me in this semester many times we you know i had the texting back and forth conversations i didn't know all the times his classes were you know just just doing that i remember what it was being there on campus and things but i just within it all when i i look at it when that news struck me that day the thing that i could look back on and said god thank you that i've got a place we've got a place that we can look at that there's a heart that you touched and responded to you i could go into more conversations of different things but his heart's desire even what god would have for him when it came as he looked at for marrying and everything else he as he would express it to you know his sister and different ones he said i want someone who's going to be right in the house of god with me that was his concern i just want to say this in this manner that's a place where we can draw comfort and strength from real comfort a real strength 20 years old we don't understand the why we don't understand that i'm sure that we probably i don't i'm not looking in this moment or in this time to understand and just put my hand in his hand i don't understand it but i know your timing in your purpose lord our hearts his parents hearts our hearts grieving the young man that in every moment that he could be within the youth meetings and right there write a part of it right there and say do god be the glory i say to god be the glory we may not understand it but god's got a purpose god's timing is perfect i pray that god gives us strength when i say first god give the family strength give them strength give them comfort let's keep them before the throne of god in these moments it's like this and if god would help us to grasp a hold of even these moments this is a it's a moment where there's like lightning striking and everything else need god with skin need god with skin we need one another we need one another let's hold them up in prayer continue i know you are i know you are let's continue to hold them up in prayer and just ask that god lord have your way move forward move for each life move for each heart i don't know because tuesday and wednesday it's hard to tell on wednesday at that funeral on how many and who all will be there god knows did you hear me i said god knows i've spoken funerals for individuals that i never knew in this lifetime but i took that opportunity because through that appointment might be a moment to reach a soul that they could see jesus i ask you let's just really be in prayer for all these things that's going to just help us and i would just say it in this manner i don't mean to keep going i want to just say if every if anything at all it's just the value that we can look at and say god let me just be with my hand in your hand and just trust him bless you heavenly father lord these few words that you placed on my heart lord the other day and lord i i don't understand i don't lord i even you know when i gathered there that evening got there with the family very lord when began to speak with me that's the thing i could say i i don't have words i don't have where i could understand the reality is is that even if you did understand or we understood it wouldn't remove the pain that we feel lord i want to say thank you lord for brother ryan's life i want to say thank you that lord that you dealt with his heart i know you deal with every heart but i want to say thank you that god that there was a receptiveness to you lord god a desire to serve you i just lord i pray that god that you'll just minister lord brother david and sister belinda lord oh god may you go to them lord sister rebecca lord and brother eddie lord drake father i could continue to call names lord sister olga god i'm asking that you'll just go to them lord comfort them lord minister to their hearts lord minister to lord every part of the family the friends lord and i i would ask lord that within every every part of this because that comfort that we draw we have such lord
