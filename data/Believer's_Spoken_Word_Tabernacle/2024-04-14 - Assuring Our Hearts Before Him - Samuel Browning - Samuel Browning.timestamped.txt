[36:39] let's turn in our Bibles to 1
[36:41] Corinthians chapter
[36:44] 11 amen
[36:58] and I want to go ahead and just read
[37:00] these scriptures as we are preparing to
[37:03] approach the Lord's Supper here in just
[37:07] a few moments and
[37:11] um amen I want to say it's good I see
[37:15] Colton here with us and uh it's so good
[37:17] to have him here you it's the second
[37:20] time that he's been here with us but uh
[37:23] he you if you don't know he's been
[37:24] coming to youth meeting and uh he's been
[37:27] for quite some time for a few years now
[37:29] so uh with little Aaron and they and so
[37:32] it's just been it's real blessing to
[37:34] have him here with us amen and uh 1
[37:37] Corinthians
[37:39] 11:23 for I have received of the Lord
[37:42] that which also I delivered unto you
[37:45] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[37:47] which he was betrayed took bread and
[37:50] when he had given things he break it and
[37:53] said take eat this is my body which is
[37:56] broken for you you this do in
[37:59] remembrance of me after the same manner
[38:02] also he took the cup and when he had
[38:04] slept saying this cup is the New
[38:06] Testament in my blood this do you as of
[38:09] as you drink it in remembrance of me for
[38:14] as often as you eat this bread and drink
[38:16] this cup you do sh the Lord's death till
[38:19] he come wherefor whosoever shall eat
[38:23] this bread and drink this cup of the
[38:25] Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the
[38:28] body and blood of the Lord but let a man
[38:31] examine himself and so let him eat of
[38:34] that bread and drink of that cup for he
[38:37] that eateth and drinketh unworthily
[38:40] eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself
[38:43] not Discerning the Lord's body for this
[38:47] cause many are weak and sickly among you
[38:51] and many sleep for if we would judge
[38:54] ourselves we should not be judged but
[38:57] but when we are judged we are chastened
[39:00] of the Lord that we should not be
[39:03] condemned with the world wherefore my
[39:06] brethren when you come together to eat t
[39:09] one for another and if any man hunger
[39:12] let him eat at home that he come not
[39:14] together unto condemnation and the rest
[39:17] will I set in order when I come amen may
[39:20] God bless you and bless the reading of
[39:21] the word as you're being seated I'm
[39:23] going to go ahead and give you a a title
[39:25] here this morning just what's on my
[39:27] heart heart and that is I'd like to just
[39:29] speak here and I'll get to some other
[39:31] scriptures on assuring our heart before
[39:36] him certainly we recognize that that's
[39:39] what the real gospel came to do was not
[39:43] to uh make us smarter make us more
[39:47] intelligent but it came to deal with the
[39:49] heart because the real the real question
[39:52] and the real where the real problem was
[39:55] at that needed to be remed was in the
[39:58] heart and there was nothing within the
[40:00] blood of bulls and goats all of those
[40:02] offerings were a type that was speaking
[40:06] that there was going to come a perfect
[40:09] lamb that through that blood which God's
[40:12] own blood that was creative blood that
[40:14] was offered for you and I it was not the
[40:16] blood that was a part of Mary or a part
[40:19] of anyone else God created that blood
[40:21] cell because all of the rest of the
[40:23] blood lined that was through the Earth
[40:25] was polluted there was was not a man
[40:28] even throughout that could have been
[40:29] searched out not one was worthy there
[40:32] had to be someone that not only would be
[40:35] willing to pay the debt I would say that
[40:38] if you think about it that when we look
[40:40] upon many times uh humanity and
[40:42] different ones we come in contact with
[40:45] uh you hear people on the job or in your
[40:47] family you would love to take the
[40:48] situation they have and and see that
[40:51] that situation would be dissolved or to
[40:53] see him help if if we don't have a
[40:55] desire to see someone else help then we
[40:58] first have to check check our own lives
[41:00] and see Lord am I really where I need to
[41:02] be and living where I need to be because
[41:04] once once you have met him your desire
[41:07] is to tell others of what he has done
[41:10] for you because you you are a living
[41:12] witness you are a testimony and that's
[41:14] what the Holy Spirit which was in that
[41:16] blood cell when it comes back upon you
[41:18] as a worshipper now you become a
[41:21] co-partner in redemption's plan it's the
[41:24] same life of God in you that Walked In
[41:27] the Garden of Eden that calls out to The
[41:30] Sinner that calls out to loved ones
[41:33] where are you and recognizing that that
[41:37] no matter the situation that's in that
[41:39] there is a God who is sufficient a blood
[41:42] that is more than enough to take care of
[41:44] the sin question and not only to do that
[41:47] but to bring a restoration to pay a debt
[41:50] but then to restore you back to your
[41:53] rightful position as a son and daughter
[41:55] of God and that's what the the Holy
[41:57] Spirit does the blood pays the price the
[42:00] blood sanctifies but the life on the
[42:03] inside of that blood cell is God's own
[42:06] life that's why the purpose the blood
[42:08] was shed so that the debt could be
[42:11] settled and that that life might come
[42:14] back upon the worshipper and put the
[42:16] worshipper back in the rightful position
[42:19] as a son and daughter of God so much so
[42:22] that it would bring nothing else can
[42:24] bring such a reality to the heart of a
[42:27] believer outside of the Holy Ghost the
[42:30] Holy Ghost is what brings the Assurance
[42:33] in our heart the Lord Jesus over and
[42:35] over through the Book of John he would
[42:38] write that he says I will not leave you
[42:40] comfortless I must go away and if I go
[42:43] away I will send the comforter to you he
[42:46] says I will come again unto you now we
[42:48] did not receive the flesh body again but
[42:51] the same comforter the same God who was
[42:54] dwelling behind that Veil that came down
[42:58] to walk among us to understand you and I
[43:01] and now going to Calvary to pay the
[43:04] price not under deception Eve was
[43:09] deceived but this lamb Adam himself
[43:12] notice this that even the first Adam he
[43:14] walked out the first Adam knowing what
[43:17] he was going to do he knew he was going
[43:19] to take his wife sin if he did not take
[43:22] her to himself then Satan himself would
[43:27] or God would have been forced to destroy
[43:30] her right is that right so this is why
[43:34] that when God God coming down and God
[43:37] becoming becoming one of us to think of
[43:40] how that God he would take his sin or
[43:43] our sin upon himself he would pay that
[43:46] price he stepped out on our behalf and
[43:50] satisfied the
[43:53] debt and then he sends back his life
[43:57] upon us as as the worshipper to make us
[44:00] aware of it to bring an assurance to our
[44:02] hearts to settle the sin question to
[44:05] dismiss fear and he comes as the
[44:07] comforter he comes and gives you and I
[44:10] that life that we had before the fall
[44:15] right only he can do that this is why
[44:18] that Redemption itself as it speaks in
[44:20] the Book of Jonah salvation is of the
[44:23] Lord God will use men anoint men with
[44:26] his Spirit that's what Peter wrote of
[44:29] that we preach this gospel with the Holy
[44:32] Spirit sent down from heaven Paul said
[44:35] how can they hear without a preacher but
[44:37] how can they preach unless they be sent
[44:40] but it's not sent by man it's sent by
[44:43] God he is the chief Apostle of our
[44:48] confession he was the one who left glory
[44:51] on our behalf to bring to you and I the
[44:54] good news he could announce to you you
[44:57] and I when he stood there and even in
[44:59] his Earthly Ministry there were holds
[45:01] upon people's lives that were dismissed
[45:04] the woman at the well we saw the sick
[45:06] being healed but that was only a
[45:08] testimony that the Jubilee that you see
[45:11] in this
[45:13] vessel what has been restored and
[45:16] manifest in one earn vessel is going to
[45:19] be when this vessel is opened up then
[45:22] other Earth and vessels will receive
[45:24] that same life and be restored back to
[45:27] their god-given
[45:30] rights
[45:32] Hallelujah and that's what he's done for
[45:34] you and I that's what he's provided for
[45:37] you and I amen I thank God for that we
[45:41] are provided to be a partaker with him
[45:45] and to see that within this this
[45:48] scripture even that Paul would would
[45:50] write of here when we look in our text
[45:53] you know when we think of
[45:55] communion uh there's three things that
[45:58] God gave the church to do wanted baptism
[46:02] I'm talking about three physical things
[46:05] to be baptized he that he that heareth
[46:07] he that believeth and is baptized shall
[46:10] be saved it said repent and be baptized
[46:14] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[46:17] remission of your sins that's the first
[46:19] thing and you shall receive the gift of
[46:21] the Holy Ghost then the two other
[46:23] ordinances that he left was that of
[46:26] taking the communion and foot washing
[46:30] taking the communion as we come to take
[46:33] this bread and this wine the bread
[46:36] itself representing that God the word
[46:40] became
[46:43] flesh we ourselves could not become a
[46:47] partaker we could not become a full
[46:49] partaker of the word the Old Testament
[46:52] prophets had experienced the word would
[46:54] come to them they would speak and
[46:57] express that word they would live under
[47:00] that word that God would give to them
[47:03] and it was speaking that there was going
[47:05] to come a time where the word itself
[47:08] would not just come and depart come and
[47:12] depart but where that the people of God
[47:15] would come under and abiding for it said
[47:18] on whom to John on whom thou see the
[47:20] spirit descend and remain it's not
[47:24] enough just for the spirit to descend
[47:26] but he's got to have a place to remain
[47:30] and when he remains there then it's God
[47:33] restoring his judgment seat in the
[47:35] hearts of his children then it's not you
[47:38] walking by I can't do this I can't do
[47:41] that yet there's a part within that but
[47:43] it's you walking from a heart filled
[47:46] with God's own life and God is love amen
[47:49] your love and devotion is to him and to
[47:52] him alone so when we find this even in
[47:55] this aspect of even even that of the
[47:57] wine recognizing that of his own life as
[48:00] we spoke just a few moments ago it's
[48:02] God's Own Life coming to you and I as
[48:05] the worshipper the blood was shed for
[48:07] you and I and the life was in it to come
[48:10] back upon you and I and bring forth the
[48:12] same life that he lived
[48:15] Hallelujah is that right not that we are
[48:18] wearing you know uh we had to wear
[48:20] sandals and and you know long
[48:21] Palestinian garment and we have to no no
[48:24] no it's where our souls end on the
[48:27] inside our souls are conformed to His
[48:31] Image so it's not that I have to look
[48:33] like the Hoffman's head of Christ but
[48:35] with his Our Lives conformed to His
[48:37] Image it will make itself known on the
[48:43] outside that right so communion itself
[48:47] you know the prophet would say it like
[48:49] this it's a real strict one because it
[48:51] brings us to a showdown right now
[48:54] meaning a strict one now we don't have
[48:55] any closed Comm commun un here we don't
[48:58] have closed communion where bar the
[48:59] doors and you have to be a part of the
[49:02] of the assembly here and so forth no we
[49:05] our doors are open but we recognize that
[49:08] within this with being a real strict one
[49:11] a showdown that it that it's always a
[49:13] moment of reflection and I believe with
[49:16] all my heart that even as within our
[49:19] walk as a Believer and as we get closer
[49:21] to the coming of the lord we want to
[49:23] assure our hearts we want to assure Ure
[49:27] our hearts in a manner that I know that
[49:29] if he's coming in the next moment I'm
[49:31] going with
[49:33] him is that right that that's what
[49:36] that's what our desire is I I want to I
[49:38] want to have that Assurance I don't want
[49:39] to see how close I can come to the edge
[49:43] I don't want to just take well what I
[49:44] was a month ago I want to know I want to
[49:47] I I want to have that part about I want
[49:49] to be that honest with
[49:53] God that I can look there in the word
[49:55] and say Lord I'm not where I need to be
[49:58] Lord but help me Lord help me what the
[50:01] word is calling to me I want to ascend
[50:04] to that place I'm telling you when your
[50:06] heart is in that condition it's in a
[50:08] very good place that in itself is
[50:11] allowing the word to move upon your life
[50:14] and your heart responding and it allows
[50:16] God to move in a place and it brings you
[50:18] an assurance because you're looking to
[50:20] him
[50:22] amen oh my I B says it like this every
[50:27] Christian and what doest thou here
[50:30] should take communion it's your duty
[50:32] it's a showdown he said Jesus said if
[50:35] you don't take it you have no part with
[50:38] me
[50:40] right but he that eateth and drinketh
[50:43] unworthily eats and drinks damnation to
[50:47] himself that is watch how watch how the
[50:50] prophet explains this if you're still
[50:52] out in the world doing things of the
[50:55] world people see you taking communion
[50:58] you're doing wrong so in other words if
[51:00] there's a complete different kind of
[51:02] life and you are living in the things of
[51:05] the world the love of the world is still
[51:07] there in your life and and everyone else
[51:09] and there and there's nothing that's
[51:11] noticeable that there's a difference in
[51:13] your
[51:14] life then watch's what he says you're
[51:16] only bringing disgrace to you if it
[51:20] it'll harm you it isn't that it'll harm
[51:24] God it harms you so a person should
[51:26] examine themselves this is why that the
[51:30] token itself is to be on display the
[51:33] holy spirit is to be on display when
[51:36] they put it there upon the door notice
[51:38] it was put on the door and it testified
[51:41] of a work that had already been received
[51:45] accepted believed for those inside the
[51:48] house so the blood being on display
[51:52] which is God's own life God's own life
[51:54] being on display is a testimony that the
[51:58] worshipper has passed from Death unto
[52:01] life and there is a son or daughter of
[52:04] God on the
[52:06] inside is that right because now
[52:10] everywhere no matter it deplay it
[52:13] displays itself in public life it
[52:15] displays its life at the office it
[52:18] displays itself that's what the life of
[52:21] Jesus Christ does it makes itself known
[52:25] amen
[52:29] hallah Hallelujah so we
[52:33] understand uh and I think uh I find it
[52:38] very much so even in this city that we
[52:40] live in I find it very much so that even
[52:43] after God can take Hearts it's such a
[52:47] such a Catholic
[52:49] Spirit um that even after God takes a
[52:53] hold of lives and hearts we can still
[52:55] try to serve god with the Glorious truth
[52:58] he's called us to but serving with a
[53:02] Catholic
[53:05] mentality where it's just you know it's
[53:07] like everything look look what's look
[53:09] what with the whole thing I you know I
[53:11] don't I didn't come out of the Catholic
[53:12] Rel I I don't have have no background
[53:14] with it so I've had to rely upon others
[53:16] and you know you've had neighbors and
[53:17] you see things and you realize it is a
[53:20] religion of
[53:22] convenience it is something that does
[53:25] not require a real change right you see
[53:29] what good does it do to confess your
[53:30] sins to another
[53:33] man it's different if you when you're
[53:35] standing here you come up and say look
[53:37] God has brought this conviction on my
[53:39] heart you're not bringing it to me to
[53:40] confess it to me as though that I can do
[53:42] something but as a Son of God Anointed
[53:45] with God's spirit as a minister of
[53:47] gospel I'm commissioned by God to cast
[53:49] that spirit away and we'll stand as
[53:52] children of God and Chase the enemy off
[53:55] your land
[53:57] because there is a blood that
[54:00] speaks better
[54:03] things better
[54:05] things a blood that says you're free a
[54:09] blood that says you are a son and
[54:12] daughter of God there's a blood that
[54:14] speaks that voice has been unsealed
[54:19] amen so we find that even within that as
[54:21] I said that Catholic mentality you find
[54:24] I remember I had Neighbors at one time
[54:25] and I I looked I said I thought what are
[54:27] they doing well what it was is they had
[54:29] plans for Sunday so you know what had to
[54:31] happen is is they need they Saturday
[54:33] mass it brings it brings a religion of
[54:35] convenience wow Sun Sunday's going to be
[54:38] it's going to infringe so may just go on
[54:40] Saturday night before we go out and do
[54:42] our own
[54:43] things it's convenience right you see
[54:47] religion is nothing but just formality
[54:50] it's a covering but it doesn't deal with
[54:53] the real situation
[54:56] listen friends that same Spirit can come
[54:59] right around here in this message and
[55:03] I'm asking you don't look at nobody else
[55:05] let the word examine your own
[55:08] life sometimes we can get into a mode of
[55:10] well you know I come on Sunday or I come
[55:12] on Thursday or I come here or there no
[55:14] no it's not about a fulfilling of well
[55:17] you know I at least hit a few few
[55:18] Services out of the month it's not about
[55:20] that it's not about that there is a a
[55:22] record that's kept it's it's about Lord
[55:25] I want to serve you with all my
[55:27] heart that's what it's about it's not
[55:30] about well this is just enough that's
[55:32] you and I determining the
[55:35] limits but you understand it's got to be
[55:38] deeper than just what we say it's got to
[55:41] be from the
[55:43] heart we must assure our
[55:47] hearts before
[55:49] him this is what this is the whole
[55:52] reality of why the gospel is preached is
[55:55] that our Liv lives would be kept clean
[55:58] our lives would be led into the place to
[56:01] the word as we Feast on that word we
[56:03] build strength in our life to Fly Above
[56:08] things to instruct Us in righteousness
[56:11] so we understand that let me make this
[56:14] point that it's also as it comes to me
[56:16] that it's also it's not just you know
[56:19] coming up and I realize sometimes coming
[56:21] from the background well it says
[56:22] whosoever doesn't take communion and you
[56:24] know is it every week that they take
[56:25] commun UN in the in the Catholic Church
[56:28] okay see I'm I'm ignorant of that part
[56:30] every time they go through there and
[56:31] what and and they they have to they come
[56:33] in oh my if they don't do that you know
[56:34] that's why they cross in front of the
[56:36] church they they whatever that's is
[56:38] that's done they do
[56:40] that yeah is that right that's right but
[56:44] yet they believe if I if I don't do this
[56:46] if I don't come and do this and and and
[56:48] it's all
[56:50] wrong this coming to take the Lord's
[56:53] Supper it's not about oh if I don't do
[56:55] this I I'm not a part of bwt I I'm not a
[56:59] part of the body of Jesus Christ no let
[57:00] me say this you are a part of the body
[57:03] of Jesus Christ by the baptism of the
[57:07] Holy
[57:09] Ghost and then you are testifying I have
[57:13] taken the word into my life what I'm
[57:16] doing here is an act I am saying I have
[57:19] become part with the
[57:21] word is that right Jesus said except you
[57:24] eat the Flesh of the son of man and
[57:26] drink his blood you have no life in
[57:31] you and those same things is what mzc
[57:34] gave Abraham after he overcame this is
[57:38] what came on the day of
[57:46] Pentecost now first first John chapter 3
[57:49] so we understand that we're we're coming
[57:51] here as as a testimony as a witness I
[57:54] I'm here as a testimony doing it in
[57:57] remembrance of him I there as a
[57:58] testimony that to say he's
[58:01] coming how can you say that cuz he's
[58:04] already
[58:05] come what do you mean he's already come
[58:07] he already came paid the price and the
[58:10] Holy Ghost the same God had returned on
[58:12] the day of Pentecost and right now he's
[58:14] returned in his fullness he has come in
[58:17] my
[58:18] life I am part of the coming of the
[58:23] Lord and I'm testifying I'm here I'm
[58:26] awaiting I'm part of the coming of the
[58:29] Lord I am part if these the I am the
[58:32] reason that he took the seals off the
[58:34] book I'm the reason that he sent this
[58:37] message I'm the reason that he sent the
[58:40] Holy Ghost brother Samuel you have that
[58:42] out of that's too bold fake is not
[58:45] robbery to be equal with God because
[58:49] Galatians for because you are Sons he
[58:53] hath sent his Spirit into your heart
[58:57] you don't become Sons when the Holy
[58:59] Ghost comes you already
[59:04] were that's why this word has meaning to
[59:07] your
[59:10] life oh
[59:13] Hallelujah verse 19 of 1 John
[59:16] 3 this is where I'm drawing my my points
[59:20] from and hereby we know that we are of
[59:24] the truth and shall assure
[59:27] our hearts before him for if our heart
[59:30] condemn
[59:31] us God is greater than our heart and
[59:36] knoweth all
[59:38] things so if there's something it's
[59:41] condemning just clear it out clear it
[59:46] out that's that's the that that's the
[59:48] best way to live clear it out if the son
[59:50] they say well I don't know airm just
[59:52] clear it
[59:53] out just clear it out yes
[59:57] beloved watch if our heart condemn us
[1:00:00] not then have we
[1:00:04] confidence toward
[1:00:07] God and whatsoever we
[1:00:09] ask we receive of him those two verses I
[1:00:12] wish I could just stand and preach on
[1:00:14] those for a Month of Sundays these two
[1:00:17] verses here is exactly where Satan wants
[1:00:20] to ensnare the Church of the Living God
[1:00:24] he either wants to remind you of all
[1:00:26] your past
[1:00:28] failures or he wants to keep you in a
[1:00:31] place to where little things that come
[1:00:33] about and we just allow things to
[1:00:35] accumulate and accumulate and accumulate
[1:00:37] and pretty soon where we could walk
[1:00:39] across this platform it looks like a
[1:00:42] hoarder lives
[1:00:44] here that's good that's
[1:00:47] good it
[1:00:49] accumulates
[1:00:52] accumulates and things we can accumulate
[1:00:54] the wrong things and you know what
[1:00:56] happens the channel of God's
[1:00:58] blessings it gets closed out upon our
[1:01:02] life that that joy that should be there
[1:01:05] in our life that
[1:01:07] enthusiasm for his presence for his word
[1:01:12] see that's always that's always a part
[1:01:14] as a Believer to diagnose and examine
[1:01:16] our life if there's time now listen
[1:01:18] there's times where there does come uh
[1:01:20] depressing or gloomy times but it's
[1:01:22] always to evaluate in that moment as a
[1:01:24] Believer Lord is there something
[1:01:26] something out of line with
[1:01:30] me is there something out of line with
[1:01:34] me how notice and whatsoever we ask we
[1:01:37] receive of him because we keep his
[1:01:40] Commandments now watch this we keep his
[1:01:42] commands so we observe those and do
[1:01:44] those things that are pleasing in his
[1:01:48] sight so what God is
[1:01:50] seeing I'm sure that every one of us
[1:01:53] know exactly what I'm speaking of that
[1:01:55] you you teas could be crossed perfectly
[1:01:59] eyes dotted in our mind but yet God
[1:02:03] don't just look at what we do here God
[1:02:06] looks down upon the
[1:02:09] heart because sometimes the things that
[1:02:11] we can be doing but yet we can have in
[1:02:14] here not the right attitude remember the
[1:02:17] Bible says have Hospitality
[1:02:21] without some go ahead say it without
[1:02:25] grudging they're grudging mean oh yeah
[1:02:27] hey we'd love to have you over house
[1:02:29] Lord have mercy couldn't why did they
[1:02:31] pick why did they pick this time Lord
[1:02:34] knows it's the busiest time of the year
[1:02:36] got to get taxes ready and everything
[1:02:39] else have Hospitality
[1:02:42] without
[1:02:44] grudging see down here down here this is
[1:02:48] why Paul could write and when he's
[1:02:51] speaking about of how that we are to
[1:02:54] press and to strive he said said do all
[1:02:56] things without murmurings and
[1:03:03] complaining
[1:03:06] Hallelujah that you might be without
[1:03:08] rebuke in this wicked generation that
[1:03:12] The Marvelous Light might
[1:03:15] shine I'll do it if ask me and pi
[1:03:25] God looks on the heart remember when God
[1:03:27] went to anoint David he sent Samuel
[1:03:31] Samuel he didn't know David was the one
[1:03:33] but remember he he went and he saw the
[1:03:35] tallest one the one that looked just
[1:03:37] exactly like fit the description and
[1:03:39] he's ready God says no he goes down
[1:03:44] through every SE every one of the Seven
[1:03:47] Sons but the eighth one is out in the
[1:03:50] field he wasn't even
[1:03:54] called that'd be like my wife having you
[1:03:56] over dinner and not let me know about
[1:03:59] it if there's one important part of the
[1:04:01] day that's an important part outside of
[1:04:04] prayer and everything else he was look
[1:04:06] look he wasn't even considered by even
[1:04:10] his
[1:04:11] parent and finally sa Samuel gets to the
[1:04:14] end and said hey there's got to be one
[1:04:17] be one because none of these are what
[1:04:20] God sent me here to
[1:04:21] anoint they got one more he said we're
[1:04:23] not going to sit down right until you
[1:04:26] bring him they wouldn't got him and they
[1:04:30] poured the anointing oil upon him but
[1:04:33] remember that anointing oil had to
[1:04:36] follow a
[1:04:39] sacrifice Samuel was afraid to go to
[1:04:42] that house because he knew what Saul had
[1:04:45] done even to other priests that had
[1:04:47] taken aside or to assist David so here
[1:04:51] Saul asked Samuel asked the question how
[1:04:54] can I go there and here God instruct
[1:04:57] Samuel go down under the cover of a
[1:05:00] sacrifice Hallelujah and say you're
[1:05:03] going to offer you're calling to a
[1:05:04] sacrifice why because without a
[1:05:07] sacrifice the true anointing cannot come
[1:05:10] and God in this hour in order for the
[1:05:12] Holy Ghost to come the sacrifice the
[1:05:15] true atonement the true Lamb of God had
[1:05:18] to step into view and this message has
[1:05:21] brought Jesus Christ off the pages into
[1:05:24] view
[1:05:27] that the works that I do shall you do
[1:05:29] also so the anointing follows the
[1:05:32] sacrifice and God finds every one of his
[1:05:35] children he looked upon the heart amen
[1:05:38] you know what God said he's got a Heart
[1:05:40] Like
[1:05:40] Mine you know as a real believer you're
[1:05:43] a part of God's heart Christ is the
[1:05:45] heart of God you were chosen in Christ
[1:05:49] in God is that right he's the complete
[1:05:51] thought but you are chosen in him and
[1:05:53] you are a part of his heart you are a
[1:05:55] part of the expression of God's
[1:05:59] [Applause]
[1:06:01] godhead oh my this is why God wants the
[1:06:06] very depths of our heart brother BR says
[1:06:08] it like this in the message communion he
[1:06:10] wants the depths of your heart he said
[1:06:12] Remember the very God that brought you
[1:06:14] here on Earth is the one you're serving
[1:06:17] he says you're doing this because he
[1:06:19] said so because it's his order then we
[1:06:21] want to come with deepness of sincerity
[1:06:26] knowing that by God's grace we have been
[1:06:30] saved and we love him and we feel his
[1:06:33] presence notice this is how how we're
[1:06:35] coming we know we have been saved we
[1:06:38] love him we feel his presence we see it
[1:06:41] change our lives our whole being is
[1:06:44] changed we're different people we don't
[1:06:47] live like we used to we don't think like
[1:06:50] we used
[1:06:52] to 1 Corinthians 10 verse 15 Paul said I
[1:06:56] speak as to wise men judge ye what I say
[1:07:01] the cup of blessing Now watch how Paul
[1:07:03] brings this and shows it to be the body
[1:07:06] of Jesus Christ the cup of blessing
[1:07:09] which we bless is it not the communion
[1:07:11] of the blood of Christ the bread which
[1:07:14] we break is it not the communion of the
[1:07:16] body of Christ I know I know that
[1:07:18] there's different ones of you that knew
[1:07:20] one another before you ever came to the
[1:07:22] Lord I know that some of you went to
[1:07:24] school with one another
[1:07:27] somebody you we know we did not have the
[1:07:31] fellowship that we have
[1:07:34] now because even fellowshipping around
[1:07:37] Earthly subjects of Science and biology
[1:07:40] and math and fad and and the everything
[1:07:43] all the important things lunch and
[1:07:45] recess and so forth no no that's not
[1:07:47] what we Fellowship around we might talk
[1:07:50] about that but that's not what's brought
[1:07:51] real Fellowship this Fellowship Paul's
[1:07:53] talking about we are a joint air a
[1:07:56] participant in one who shares an
[1:07:59] intimate heart like David spoke to
[1:08:01] Jonathan they spoke back and forth their
[1:08:03] hearts were inter knitted together with
[1:08:06] the same purpose that's why Paul could
[1:08:08] said regarding Timothy I have no other
[1:08:10] man likeminded meaning equal in Soul
[1:08:14] having the same desire the same
[1:08:17] purpose it's a fellowship that we have
[1:08:21] it's a communion that we have
[1:08:25] for we watch how he brings this now
[1:08:27] because look he became flesh his life
[1:08:32] the word became flesh his life living
[1:08:34] through the body making that word do
[1:08:36] what it said it would do right then he
[1:08:38] says for we being many are one
[1:08:42] bread many but we're part of that one
[1:08:45] bread we're we're not off here and off
[1:08:47] here no no we're part of that one bread
[1:08:50] we are part of the
[1:08:52] word and one body for we are all part
[1:08:55] partakers of that one bread so I say we
[1:08:59] must remember we're a body of Believers
[1:09:03] Paul would take a a time to express that
[1:09:07] you know and and and sometimes uh you
[1:09:09] know this past week I had different
[1:09:11] things that I dealt with with headaches
[1:09:13] and things and pressure behind my eyes
[1:09:15] and my head and everything and some of
[1:09:16] that started last weekend and ah my man
[1:09:20] I tell
[1:09:21] you nobody likes when your your body's
[1:09:24] aching but you know what because that my
[1:09:26] head was aching did not make my hand
[1:09:29] complain or my hand just say you know
[1:09:31] what I don't got time for you you know
[1:09:34] what I needed my
[1:09:36] hand I needed my hand to open the
[1:09:38] cupboard to get me some
[1:09:43] Tylenol I wanted molum but all I had was
[1:09:46] Tylenol I needed
[1:09:48] it I I I needed the assistance of my
[1:09:52] hand but now my hand could not solve
[1:09:55] problem problem s right that's that's
[1:09:58] that's that's not even my head it's
[1:09:59] what's inside of my head right right so
[1:10:03] even the parts that I cannot see I need
[1:10:06] every single part of the body this is
[1:10:09] why this is why Paul is bringing this
[1:10:11] and here we come and stand here together
[1:10:14] as we stand together to remember our
[1:10:16] journey here together of who it is that
[1:10:19] has brought us together and what our
[1:10:20] real purpose is it's a fellowship one
[1:10:23] with another under the blood of Jesus
[1:10:26] Christ I need my brother I need my
[1:10:29] sister we need one
[1:10:32] another Hallelujah is that right I love
[1:10:36] I love you know even my ugly feet I
[1:10:38] still like them because I like being
[1:10:40] able to stand
[1:10:43] up yeah even my my hands that a short
[1:10:48] stubby biscuit smackers I still like
[1:10:50] them you know why they help me get
[1:10:52] biscuits they help me get pieces of pie
[1:10:54] they help me they help me reach out and
[1:10:57] Shake Your
[1:11:01] Hand you let one little thing a little
[1:11:03] hang nail or something come up on it
[1:11:09] woo see this is why it's so important
[1:11:12] our walk with one another watch how
[1:11:15] watch how the enemy would like to come
[1:11:16] in and and try to trouble that that
[1:11:18] communion in the message Jubilee Year
[1:11:21] brother BR says if you have enmity
[1:11:23] against some neighbor against somebody
[1:11:24] else that's done you harm now not about
[1:11:27] what's done that you've done but what's
[1:11:29] done you harm and that person has done
[1:11:32] you harm if you in your heart can't love
[1:11:35] that person don't take that
[1:11:41] experience If It's Love in here it shows
[1:11:44] out here I'm just you know what if
[1:11:47] there's thing brother Samuel you ever
[1:11:48] been there
[1:11:51] before H are you kidding me
[1:11:55] and that's the first place I start is
[1:11:57] right here right here inside God fill my
[1:12:00] life with more of your love why that I
[1:12:02] can look beyond their fence not holding
[1:12:05] somebody as I am here to remind you you
[1:12:08] are guilty guilty guilty how's that kind
[1:12:11] for love that's not love love cover a
[1:12:15] multitude of
[1:12:17] sins because you know what love is it is
[1:12:19] a direct tie to the atonement of which I
[1:12:22] am tied
[1:12:24] into and this is why I'm saying if
[1:12:26] someone asked you to forgive them it is
[1:12:28] your duty to forgive them and if they
[1:12:31] haven't asked you it's still your duty
[1:12:32] to forgive
[1:12:34] them and forgiveness is not lips Jesus
[1:12:38] said if you don't do it from your
[1:12:42] heart then when you go to
[1:12:45] pray see these are simple principles in
[1:12:49] God's
[1:12:50] word that if they're not followed they
[1:12:53] hinder the word the Third they hinder
[1:12:56] the move of
[1:12:58] God Little Things little
[1:13:03] things oh my you must love those who do
[1:13:07] not love you if you love those who love
[1:13:11] you facebookers do the same Sinners do
[1:13:14] the
[1:13:15] same insta whatever do it but you got
[1:13:18] now not just to act like it in a
[1:13:20] religious life but from your heart you
[1:13:23] have to amen right
[1:13:29] now watch
[1:13:30] this brother Bram takes this scripture
[1:13:32] and I I think this is very important
[1:13:34] here because as we recognize and serving
[1:13:36] one another as we t one for another in 1
[1:13:40] Corinthians
[1:13:41] 11:33 when you come together Terry one
[1:13:43] for another Terry means to wait it also
[1:13:46] means to serve right now I hope you
[1:13:49] understand friends when we're talking
[1:13:51] about what things of forgiveness we
[1:13:53] could preach months upon this there a
[1:13:55] things that we have if God leads us to
[1:13:57] do certain things like that we'll do it
[1:13:59] but I can tell you be honest with God if
[1:14:02] there's something that's in your heart
[1:14:04] that's not right let me tell you
[1:14:05] something brother Brown says it like
[1:14:07] this he says if you've got one ought in
[1:14:09] your heart against
[1:14:11] anybody you are in danger of
[1:14:16] Hellfire that's how important it is it's
[1:14:19] not just about that it's about your own
[1:14:22] life and your own walk with God
[1:14:25] true you realize if you can't go up and
[1:14:27] Shake somebody's hand and stand in their
[1:14:29] presence and talk with them something is
[1:14:33] wrong
[1:14:35] woo are you hearing me we can't say
[1:14:39] we're going to go in a Rapture that way
[1:14:40] we're not going in a Rapture that way it
[1:14:44] should not even be something that we
[1:14:45] should feel comfortable even coming and
[1:14:47] standing
[1:14:51] here you see what I'm saying then when
[1:14:53] brother ran talks about this being a
[1:14:55] showdown and a strict one that's how we
[1:14:57] ought to live our life it should not be
[1:14:59] well I got to get serious communion
[1:15:00] servic is coming up this is why brother
[1:15:02] BR says in this quote I'm getting ready
[1:15:04] to read he says this is one thing that
[1:15:07] keeps the People Prayed
[1:15:10] up but it should be prayed up I want to
[1:15:12] be ready to
[1:15:16] go I want to be ready I don't know when
[1:15:19] my number is going to be called I want
[1:15:21] to be ready I want to be available I
[1:15:23] don't know who God's going to ask me to
[1:15:24] make me minister to speak to or to
[1:15:27] witness to I don't know but I want to be
[1:15:38] available so my brother Ram he goes
[1:15:41] Brianna go to that second statement of
[1:15:42] let your life so shine before men right
[1:15:45] below paragraph
[1:15:47] 14 watch how he says we should come
[1:15:51] reverently solemnly sacredly right
[1:15:55] walking up confessing all of our wrongs
[1:15:58] praying one for the other not only that
[1:16:01] watch's this we should feel if there's a
[1:16:04] brother or sister Among Us that we feel
[1:16:06] is just a little bit out of line
[1:16:08] somewhere our hearts ought to be
[1:16:12] burdened for that person on communion
[1:16:14] night watch this especially to see them
[1:16:19] that they'll be able to walk up and take
[1:16:22] communion and not be condemned with the
[1:16:25] world because they are our brothers or
[1:16:29] sisters so something that we would see
[1:16:31] that maybe is not in line like brother
[1:16:34] Rand puts it in this of the weight or to
[1:16:36] T on one another this is where we serve
[1:16:38] one another this is where it's not us
[1:16:41] spying on one another it's not us
[1:16:43] sitting down and getting together over
[1:16:45] somebody else's house and we have a list
[1:16:47] of people that we just going to tear
[1:16:49] down that should not
[1:16:52] be there should not be I a pastor over a
[1:16:55] quote where the spirit of God in that
[1:16:56] Jubilee year where the spirit of God has
[1:16:59] convicted the prophet for being critical
[1:17:02] of other ministers that he saw things
[1:17:04] that were
[1:17:06] wrong but he said who am I to correct
[1:17:09] them and condemn
[1:17:12] them God corrected
[1:17:15] him and he dealt with that part of it
[1:17:17] but notice this waiting on one another
[1:17:20] they serving one another I'm part of the
[1:17:23] body like I said when my head was
[1:17:24] conting I needed my hands I needed it to
[1:17:27] serve that part of the
[1:17:30] body I didn't say what's your fault
[1:17:32] sinus cavities I mean look I mean it's
[1:17:35] not not my fault not my fault that the
[1:17:38] pollen's flying in the air it's not my
[1:17:40] fault that you know you don't have hair
[1:17:42] up there it's not my fault that you were
[1:17:44] sitting under a draft it's not my
[1:17:48] fault I know that I don't say that to be
[1:17:51] comical but Paul brought those things
[1:17:53] into the body
[1:17:55] right sometimes we're so interested in
[1:17:58] trying to if you'd have done this and
[1:18:00] this and this and this and this and this
[1:18:01] and this forgive us for not being
[1:18:03] perfect like you wow
[1:18:06] wow maybe your blood should have been
[1:18:09] shed wow I don't mean that to be I'm
[1:18:13] just trying friends look we have to look
[1:18:15] at our own
[1:18:16] lives and recognize we need God's grace
[1:18:20] for our own lives
[1:18:23] hallelujah hallelujah I don't care you
[1:18:25] know when a person is living where they
[1:18:27] should be and close to God you don't
[1:18:29] have to worry about them looking down on
[1:18:31] somebody
[1:18:33] else because why they've get in the
[1:18:35] right position and they got their eyes
[1:18:36] looking to him and knowing that they
[1:18:39] themselves are are a sinner as well
[1:18:40] saved by the grace of God Son of God
[1:18:42] true but they need God's grace every day
[1:18:44] of their
[1:18:45] life this is where waiting on one
[1:18:48] another comes into play God allows these
[1:18:51] this similitude these symbols to bring
[1:18:54] us into places where we are to live in
[1:18:57] our
[1:19:02] lives you know brother Brown talks about
[1:19:04] our neighbors he says you got to such a
[1:19:07] place nowadays he said somebody have to
[1:19:10] tell you your neighbor died you have to
[1:19:12] read in the paper it used to be
[1:19:14] neighbors were friendly they were
[1:19:16] neighborly not just somebody who lives
[1:19:17] next door to you now I look at those
[1:19:20] statements said over and over but I
[1:19:23] wonder sometimes how much of our life
[1:19:27] has been so taken to where we live in
[1:19:31] our own little
[1:19:34] world we don't consider anybody
[1:19:38] else it's my problems and I'm not listen
[1:19:42] I'm not minimizing you understand me I
[1:19:44] am not
[1:19:46] minimizing toils of this life you have
[1:19:50] pressures I have pressures but there's a
[1:19:53] place to let that pressure off God has
[1:19:57] called us as a body of Believers there's
[1:20:01] people that you will reach that I would
[1:20:04] never reach there's lives in where God
[1:20:08] will use you right that he would not use
[1:20:11] me in that way but there's also the need
[1:20:14] Among Us in the body to help one another
[1:20:17] to encourage one another the Bible says
[1:20:19] look not every man on his own things but
[1:20:22] also on the things of others
[1:20:25] see we're living listen to me very
[1:20:26] carefully don't don't don't pull up on
[1:20:28] me don't pull up on me you got to
[1:20:30] understand that's a spirit the Bible
[1:20:33] says this age is a spirit that is a
[1:20:35] lover of
[1:20:38] themselves decisions are made based on
[1:20:44] self and let me just tell you something
[1:20:47] I don't care how many services you said
[1:20:48] it first of all you need the Holy Ghost
[1:20:51] but even after the Holy Ghost has come
[1:20:54] every ser that you said it we need to
[1:20:56] it's true we need to set in the house of
[1:20:58] God but it will cause you and I to reain
[1:21:00] over oursel because there's a part about
[1:21:02] us then whether we want to admit it or
[1:21:05] not this guy is still number one that's
[1:21:11] right when it come I'm I'm I'm tired I'm
[1:21:16] tired but to wait on one another to wait
[1:21:20] on one another this is why brother BR
[1:21:22] says when you wait on one another you
[1:21:23] you see somebody that's out of maybe you
[1:21:25] You' seen him out running around with
[1:21:26] somebody else you've seen him out living
[1:21:28] in the world and you know dressing like
[1:21:30] the acting like just acting like the
[1:21:31] just just out in the world and there's
[1:21:33] no there's not even the slightest little
[1:21:36] bit of resonating in their heart you
[1:21:38] just see him just going out carelessly
[1:21:39] says you don't walk up in the communion
[1:21:41] line and jerk them out but he says you
[1:21:44] pray for him and he says then after that
[1:21:48] service is over he says you pray and you
[1:21:50] go to him and love and say brother
[1:21:51] forgive me but I noticed this I see you
[1:21:54] out here this reports come in brother
[1:21:56] let's let's get this confessed let's get
[1:21:58] it under the
[1:21:59] blood that's waiting on one another
[1:22:03] that's serving one another I don't want
[1:22:06] no one to miss it and not only that I I
[1:22:09] don't want Christ to be hindered do you
[1:22:10] want him to be hindered I don't want him
[1:22:12] to be I want him to move when I because
[1:22:15] we don't never know the needs that we
[1:22:16] have in lives that will come in here we
[1:22:18] want him to be free to move I don't want
[1:22:21] no
[1:22:23] hindrances that's why we are servants
[1:22:25] one to another now may one one place in
[1:22:28] scripture here numbers
[1:22:34] 15 verse
[1:22:36] 27 I want to read this
[1:22:40] because this is where the Lord was
[1:22:42] taking me to I want to read this because
[1:22:44] at times when we come into communion
[1:22:47] sometimes communion it's things that
[1:22:50] it's not always looked at correctly you
[1:22:51] can have things where people just they
[1:22:54] my you know they just feel like well I
[1:22:57] I'm not worthy well none of us are
[1:22:59] worthy but but but he's the one who
[1:23:02] makes us
[1:23:03] worthy he in me makes me walk
[1:23:06] worthy now watch this how God put this
[1:23:08] in in numbers 15 if any Soul sin through
[1:23:12] ignorance then he shall bring a she goat
[1:23:14] of the first year for a sin offering and
[1:23:17] the priest shall make an atonement for
[1:23:19] that soul that sinth ignorantly when he
[1:23:21] sinth by ignorance before the Lord to
[1:23:23] make an Aton for him and it shall be
[1:23:27] forgiven him key word
[1:23:30] ignorance verse 29 you shall have one
[1:23:33] law for him that sinth through ignorance
[1:23:36] both for him that is born among the
[1:23:37] children of Israel and for the stranger
[1:23:39] that sojourneth among them but the soul
[1:23:41] that doth ought
[1:23:44] presumptuously whether he be born in the
[1:23:46] land or a stranger the same reproacheth
[1:23:48] the Lord and that Soul shall be cut off
[1:23:51] now this is the meaning then of what
[1:23:53] presumptuous is because he hath despised
[1:23:57] the word of the Lord yeah that's good
[1:24:01] that's good this is God's word I don't
[1:24:02] have to do that that's just their
[1:24:06] thought if it's God's word it's God's
[1:24:10] word but you see what's coming down to
[1:24:13] it's not even about the
[1:24:15] ACT it's about the heart behind it when
[1:24:21] the heart
[1:24:22] says that's
[1:24:27] and hath broken his Commandment that
[1:24:29] Soul shall be utterly cut off his
[1:24:32] iniquity shall be on
[1:24:33] him now I don't have time to read
[1:24:36] Hebrews 10 but this is what Paul's
[1:24:39] speaking of in Hebrews 10 when he says
[1:24:42] if we sin willfully after we've received
[1:24:43] the knowledge of the truth there
[1:24:45] remaineth no sacrifice for sin verse 28
[1:24:48] it say he despised Moses law died
[1:24:50] without Mercy under two or three
[1:24:52] Witnesses now watch watch through this
[1:24:55] this this portion of numbers 15 here I
[1:24:57] have a few more
[1:24:59] verses while the children of Israel were
[1:25:01] in the wilderness they found a man that
[1:25:03] gathered sticks upon the Sabbath day now
[1:25:06] remember that was a no no you don't work
[1:25:07] on the Sabbath day you don't gather
[1:25:10] there was not even man are going to fall
[1:25:11] on the Sabbath day right you don't go
[1:25:14] out and do that but here was a man
[1:25:16] Gathering sticks on the Sabbath
[1:25:19] day and they found him Gathering sticks
[1:25:22] brought him unto Moses and Aaron and
[1:25:24] unto all the congregation and they put
[1:25:26] him in
[1:25:28] Ward because it was not declared what
[1:25:31] they should be done to him so they don't
[1:25:33] know at this time what what do we do to
[1:25:35] this man is this man is in ignorance or
[1:25:38] is it
[1:25:40] presumptuous is it ignorance that he
[1:25:41] don't know what's going on or is it
[1:25:43] something that he's just stepping right
[1:25:45] over he just just it doesn't
[1:25:47] matter see now what's needed is it's not
[1:25:52] just condemnation because of the act
[1:25:55] we've got to know the
[1:25:57] heart we've got to know the
[1:25:59] heart and the Lord said unto Moses The
[1:26:02] man shall be surely put to death and all
[1:26:05] the congregation shall Stone him with
[1:26:07] stones without the camp and all the
[1:26:09] congregation brought him without the
[1:26:11] camp and stoned him with stones and he
[1:26:13] died as the Lord commanded Moses so he
[1:26:18] was determined the man didn't do it out
[1:26:20] of ignorance he just despised he just
[1:26:24] said
[1:26:25] just it doesn't
[1:26:26] matter it wasn't ignorance you see what
[1:26:29] ignorance is is when you don't
[1:26:31] know ignorance is when there's things
[1:26:33] that's stumbled
[1:26:35] into are you with me this is why listen
[1:26:39] this is why I I hope I hope you're
[1:26:42] hearing me now this is why the word of
[1:26:44] God it's not coming in a manner and
[1:26:47] saying well if you do this you're not
[1:26:49] bride if you don't do this if you no no
[1:26:52] it's where it comes down to if if you
[1:26:54] love the world or the things of the
[1:26:57] world then the love of God is not in
[1:26:59] your heart so what's it bringing it down
[1:27:02] to it's not acts it's what's in the
[1:27:06] heart are you hearing me it's what's in
[1:27:09] the heart this is why this is why that
[1:27:12] with things that when when if it's that
[1:27:14] way it just keep you up and down and and
[1:27:17] no no it's to realize if there's still a
[1:27:19] hunger if the hunger is for the world or
[1:27:21] the things of the world you've not
[1:27:22] arrived but I say Keep
[1:27:24] pressing are you hearing me keep
[1:27:28] pressing keep
[1:27:30] pressing this guy is always going to
[1:27:32] want a side with the world but I'm
[1:27:34] talking about this man on the inside
[1:27:36] here can I have just a few more moments
[1:27:39] I want to I really want to move this in
[1:27:41] I'm talking about assuring our hearts
[1:27:43] the Bible said Romans 8:16 the spirit
[1:27:45] beareth witness with our spirit that we
[1:27:48] are the children of God our spirit when
[1:27:50] we say well I I have the Holy Spirit
[1:27:52] then it will bear Witness with God's
[1:27:54] spirit God's word and that's how we know
[1:27:57] we're Sons and Daughters of
[1:28:01] God let me
[1:28:03] read from a
[1:28:05] sister whom brother Bram even speaks
[1:28:08] about how that she was even with some
[1:28:09] others listening to the message of the
[1:28:12] hour in her
[1:28:13] home and the pillar of fire came in and
[1:28:17] went right over the tape player they
[1:28:20] wondered what it was about and brother
[1:28:21] Bram says what that was it's God's
[1:28:24] showing you have accepted his
[1:28:28] message now that's earlier years I'm
[1:28:31] going to read 1964 sister Georgie Bruce
[1:28:35] sister Bruce says I make so many
[1:28:37] mistakes and I fail so many times right
[1:28:42] you mind we could put brother Samuel
[1:28:44] sister so and so anybody else feel that
[1:28:46] way
[1:28:48] yeah that's why Christ had to die so
[1:28:51] that you with your mistakes wouldn't be
[1:28:54] lotted to you he took your mistakes your
[1:28:57] desire in your heart is to serve him she
[1:28:59] says yes that's what he died for so you
[1:29:03] could serve him your mistakes are not
[1:29:06] looked or not lotted to you he is your
[1:29:09] prop situation he is your sin offering
[1:29:13] your sins are not known you're not a
[1:29:15] sinner before God God took your sins and
[1:29:19] became you cuz your desire is to serve
[1:29:22] him this is why the challenges even
[1:29:25] among for our own lives and among one
[1:29:28] another is because we know our own
[1:29:32] self we look at him or look at her in
[1:29:35] the mirror every single day that's why
[1:29:38] we must take the word above what even
[1:29:41] our own thoughts or what we even know
[1:29:44] about ourselves are you hearing me and
[1:29:47] the same way with that that's the same
[1:29:49] way with a body of Believers if you take
[1:29:51] a home that does not know Grace and for
[1:29:54] forgiveness and really Redemption if you
[1:29:56] don't know that then it's so hard things
[1:29:59] are so fragmented but in order for there
[1:30:01] to be a home to survive and make it it
[1:30:03] will take Grace forgiveness and
[1:30:06] Redemption it'll take the spirit of God
[1:30:08] in order for a church to thrive in order
[1:30:11] for a church to work in harmony as a
[1:30:13] body of Believers it takes the working
[1:30:16] of the spirit of God Ting Grace
[1:30:19] forgiveness Redemption one among
[1:30:22] another if not it'll never make the
[1:30:25] great right but you know what how could
[1:30:29] we
[1:30:30] forgive if there wern't people to
[1:30:35] forgive how could we well I want I want
[1:30:38] to be like Jesus he said forgive even as
[1:30:41] he forgave you see there's parts of the
[1:30:44] word that I'll be honest with you my
[1:30:46] flesh My Flesh My Flesh My Flesh don't
[1:30:49] mind I mean I really wouldn't want to
[1:30:51] walk on the water as far as out there
[1:30:53] but if he told me I could Walk On The
[1:30:54] Water I'm going to take him at his word
[1:30:56] I would probably first of all raise my
[1:30:58] hand and say I'll take care of that but
[1:31:00] what if he's asked me to go through a
[1:31:02] trial go through something where I am
[1:31:05] called upon to manifest that attribute
[1:31:09] of
[1:31:12] forgiveness our flesh will not raise
[1:31:15] that
[1:31:16] hand but God knows what we have need of
[1:31:21] when we have need of it he's not the the
[1:31:24] author of confusion or frustration he's
[1:31:26] got a purpose in mind is that right so
[1:31:29] to see that how that desire is to serve
[1:31:31] him notice God sees the desire it's not
[1:31:34] the ACT it's the desire on the inside
[1:31:36] notice sister Bruce says but I've never
[1:31:39] had an experience that I've been filled
[1:31:40] with the Holy Ghost that I could put my
[1:31:42] foot on notice he says ordinarily I love
[1:31:46] how the word answers this a human being
[1:31:48] is born in sin shaped in iniquity come
[1:31:50] to the world speaking lies that's the
[1:31:53] nature of a human being Sister Bruce
[1:31:55] says yes what do you say
[1:32:00] yes that was your nature it changed once
[1:32:06] but what changed
[1:32:08] it Christ there you are she had the
[1:32:13] answer to the devil's question the whole
[1:32:19] time but but you know I I picked up I
[1:32:23] picked up sticks on the Sabbath but see
[1:32:24] the word goes down the desire in your
[1:32:27] heart is to serve him the desire is not
[1:32:29] to walk over his word the desire is to
[1:32:32] come under his word the desire is to
[1:32:34] live for him the desire is to please
[1:32:38] him hallelujah it's not about I have to
[1:32:40] do this I can't do that I want to please
[1:32:43] him there's nothing that he can ask me
[1:32:46] that I wouldn't say yes Lord my flesh
[1:32:49] might say no no no but that's so on the
[1:32:53] inside says though he slay me
[1:32:57] I will serve
[1:33:00] him he paid the
[1:33:03] price so that desire could come
[1:33:08] forth and then the word brings the
[1:33:12] discernment
[1:33:15] ignorance not presumptuously not
[1:33:18] arrogantly not I oh no see this is this
[1:33:21] is this is word discerning our
[1:33:27] hearts First John
[1:33:31] 3 verse 8 he that committeth sin that
[1:33:34] word committeth means practice is of the
[1:33:38] devil for the devil sinth from the
[1:33:40] beginning for this purpose the Son of
[1:33:42] God was manifested that he might destroy
[1:33:45] the works of the devil whosoever is born
[1:33:48] of God do not
[1:33:51] practice
[1:33:52] sin that's what that word commit means
[1:33:55] you can look in your margin to scoffield
[1:33:57] Bible for his seed whose seed his seed
[1:34:01] remaineth in
[1:34:03] him his seed his life has come into that
[1:34:06] W seed in your life and it remains there
[1:34:10] it's his desire your heart has become
[1:34:14] the Judgment seat of
[1:34:17] Christ to where when there's things that
[1:34:20] not only that you would say that might
[1:34:22] be wrong
[1:34:24] because listen we don't all start out
[1:34:27] fully matured when God takes a hold of a
[1:34:30] life this is where you have to be
[1:34:32] careful among a body Believers when God
[1:34:34] gets a hold of a life there's maturing
[1:34:36] in your life like there's maturing in
[1:34:38] another person's life and God comes into
[1:34:41] things i' I've absolutely had things
[1:34:42] here over the years where some seems
[1:34:44] like people would want to crucify
[1:34:46] somebody else because of some sort of a
[1:34:48] a character thing and I said wait wait
[1:34:49] wait wait wait wait wait I would sit
[1:34:51] down and speak to and say wait wait wait
[1:34:52] wait this person has not come from the
[1:34:54] upbringing and background that you know
[1:34:56] about and what I don't understand is why
[1:34:58] are you wanting to crucify that's what I
[1:35:01] don't understand I don't understand that
[1:35:04] I I can't understand the spirit of
[1:35:05] Christ being that way now what matters
[1:35:09] is you know just to correct that I
[1:35:10] wasn't to put down if the person
[1:35:12] individual would all of a sudden
[1:35:13] responded and reive that and realize
[1:35:15] yeah that's exactly right it's not
[1:35:17] condoning maybe certain Expressions that
[1:35:19] are out there but let's have Grace let's
[1:35:22] let's get let's let's have Grace let's
[1:35:24] work to bring that one along that sister
[1:35:26] or that brother let's get next to them
[1:35:28] yes sir maybe there's certain words I'm
[1:35:31] not talking about cursing and swearing
[1:35:32] maybe there's just certain words that
[1:35:33] they tell people about certain things
[1:35:35] they're getting ready to do and you're
[1:35:36] like whoa that that's not Kosher man
[1:35:39] that might be out there and wherever
[1:35:40] more that that that's not just not but
[1:35:42] you see what it is a spirit of God
[1:35:44] moving around in that Redemption we work
[1:35:46] with one another to serve one
[1:35:49] another everybody with
[1:35:51] me my my my now watch
[1:35:59] this we have an advocate verse one of 1
[1:36:03] John 2 My Little Children these things
[1:36:05] write unto you that you sin not and if
[1:36:06] any man sin we have an advocate with the
[1:36:08] father Jesus Christ the righteous and he
[1:36:11] is the
[1:36:13] pretu for our sins and not for ours only
[1:36:17] but also for the sins of the whole world
[1:36:19] so not only does he take care of the sin
[1:36:23] problem in our life but he is there to
[1:36:26] keep us
[1:36:27] clean represent us in the presence of
[1:36:32] God
[1:36:34] constantly we have one who stands for us
[1:36:37] and the spirit of God within us is what
[1:36:40] convicts
[1:36:41] us leads us to a place of repentance now
[1:36:46] does that mean think of this right here
[1:36:47] does that mean at times that we don't
[1:36:49] need the word to come down and correct
[1:36:51] us does that mean oh brother
[1:36:54] why why why didn't I catch that before
[1:36:55] why didn't I catch that when I said that
[1:36:57] like that out there that day but did you
[1:36:59] catch it now see what's important did
[1:37:02] you catch it now don't don't you don't
[1:37:04] you're wrestling with the wrong thing of
[1:37:05] why didn't I catch that before no it's
[1:37:07] God remember if we do not judge
[1:37:10] ourselves he'll judge us why that we be
[1:37:14] not condemned with the world God brings
[1:37:16] correction to our lives to help us and
[1:37:18] we learn from those things in our life
[1:37:21] watch this in the message adoption I
[1:37:23] have to lay this in how can you preach
[1:37:25] predestination of God's for ordaining
[1:37:27] and setting unless there's a sin
[1:37:29] atonement somewhere why is it each day
[1:37:31] you make a mistake each day you do wrong
[1:37:34] but if you're born again man or woman as
[1:37:37] soon as you make the mistake God knows
[1:37:39] you're sorry for it now that doesn't
[1:37:41] take away from repentance but he knows
[1:37:44] you're sorry for it and then that'll
[1:37:47] come forth you would stand in the Pres
[1:37:50] of presence of President Roosevelt or
[1:37:52] anyone else say I'm wrong God forgive me
[1:37:55] for this thing you notice he said that
[1:37:57] it says s i ns sins a sinner is a sinner
[1:38:03] he does not commit sins but the church
[1:38:06] commits sins does wrong gets a wrong
[1:38:08] thought wrong impression anybody been
[1:38:11] there well not me brother Samuel I don't
[1:38:14] get the wrong thought you got the wrong
[1:38:15] one right now I ain't never had the
[1:38:17] wrong impression you got the wrong
[1:38:18] impression right
[1:38:21] now we get a wrong wrong thought a wrong
[1:38:24] impression oh so and so I think so and
[1:38:26] so's got it out for me I think we get
[1:38:27] the wrong
[1:38:28] Impressions makes Scruples wobbles like
[1:38:32] a little child walking trying to learn
[1:38:34] how to walk he don't know how to walk
[1:38:36] good yet cause he's a little boy but we
[1:38:38] have a hand that reaches down it gets us
[1:38:42] steadies us and says make this step this
[1:38:46] way son he doesn't pick us up and spank
[1:38:49] us because we made a mistake he doesn't
[1:38:52] beat us to death because we're trying to
[1:38:54] walk he loves us like we love our
[1:38:57] children a real real daddy wouldn't whip
[1:39:01] his child when he's trying to walk if he
[1:39:03] falls down on the floor reach right down
[1:39:06] with a big strong hand and pick him up
[1:39:08] and take both hands a hold of him and
[1:39:11] say this is the way you do it son walk
[1:39:14] like
[1:39:17] this why we're not born fully
[1:39:21] mature but the Holy Ghost is the spirit
[1:39:24] of adoption it leads us to full maturity
[1:39:27] you know it's a spirit of God working in
[1:39:29] your life that brings conviction it's a
[1:39:31] spirit of God in your life that quickens
[1:39:33] that word that allows you to be
[1:39:36] teachable allows you to be led it's a
[1:39:39] spirit of God in your life that brings
[1:39:42] about humility in your life to the word
[1:39:45] and to one
[1:39:46] another well that got quiet that's what
[1:39:50] does it the spirit of God I think as we
[1:39:52] close here on this and prepare to come
[1:39:55] and gather around
[1:39:57] here what a moment to assure our hearts
[1:40:01] before him in his presence it's not
[1:40:04] something we we're looking at and even
[1:40:07] in our walk with God to we never want to
[1:40:09] take it for granted you never want to
[1:40:10] take it for granted you want to you want
[1:40:12] to assure your heart before him want to
[1:40:17] look if there's things that you realize
[1:40:20] that in your life in your heart and just
[1:40:22] if there's if there's a if there's a I
[1:40:23] don't care it don't matter what brother
[1:40:25] Samuel says it don't matter what listen
[1:40:27] it it listen it ain't about me if I if
[1:40:29] if if I'm preaching my opinion then I
[1:40:31] shouldn't be standing up
[1:40:33] here I'm not preaching my opinion when
[1:40:36] I'm preaching I can back up with the
[1:40:37] scripture and the message of the hour
[1:40:40] and if I can't if it is not within the
[1:40:42] message of the hour I am not pulling it
[1:40:44] from some other
[1:40:46] source sorry just just just not going
[1:40:49] there amen but we can pull it right from
[1:40:53] there and there's something within our
[1:40:55] hearts that says yes Lord be it unto me
[1:40:58] Lord according to Thy
[1:41:00] word oh my you you you might have been
[1:41:03] sure make mistakes sure we do but what's
[1:41:05] important is is have we been born again
[1:41:07] of the spirit of God what's important is
[1:41:08] where's your heart at with God is your
[1:41:10] heart's desire to please him maybe
[1:41:13] you're in a process and you're in
[1:41:14] Journey right now and journeying on
[1:41:16] listen friends don't don't let don't
[1:41:18] don't let just don't stop in some place
[1:41:19] keep walking with God keep on walking
[1:41:22] with him because if you stop it allows
[1:41:25] the enemy an opportunity to move back in
[1:41:28] that's why you want to keep going until
[1:41:30] you're filled and when you're filled say
[1:41:32] Lord help me to grow when you make a
[1:41:35] mistake Lord here's my hand here's my
[1:41:38] hand the how you don't know how many
[1:41:40] times I've fallen oh my the Bible says a
[1:41:44] righteous man falleth seven times but he
[1:41:48] gets back up you know why there's
[1:41:51] something in him to get back up in
[1:41:54] am there's something hallelujah oh man
[1:41:58] the man that that got knocked down the
[1:42:00] most over an England in one of the
[1:42:02] boxing matches I forget how many
[1:42:03] hundreds of times he was knocked down
[1:42:06] because rounds were based on knockdowns

[1:42:11] but he got back up and he eventually won
[1:42:14] the
[1:42:15] fight you know why CU he had one more
