[37:07] you just a couple familiar scriptures
[37:11] very familiar scriptures we've
[37:13] heard all of our days you know living in

[37:19] never let never let scripture become
[37:21] common to you
[37:24] amen Luke 1729 and
[37:27] 30 but the same day that lot went out of

[37:40] when the son of man is

[37:47] 3:20 I'm not uh too skilled like brother
[37:50] Samuel yet I don't have the scriptures

[39:31] you're trying to do father in the name
[39:33] of Jesus Christ am amenallah
[39:37] amen you may be
[39:41] seated God's only provided place to
[39:44] worship brother Brandon was speaking in
[39:46] in the beginning of the service he goes
[39:47] I was sitting over there talking to my
[39:49] old friend brother Brown while the songs
[39:52] were going on and he said brother
[39:54] brandham I never seen till yesterday
[39:56] today what you've been talking about he
[39:59] said If people could just get into what
[40:01] you're speaking about said every
[40:04] obstacle would move out of the way
[40:07] that's exactly right that's right it's
[40:09] exactly right if you could just grasp it
[40:11] grasp it and could catch
[40:14] it and my my topic tonight what the
[40:18] Lord's just been dealing with upon my
[40:20] heart is don't miss your
[40:24] visitation and you know we're living in
[40:26] the last
[40:27] days and evil is all around
[40:30] us and
[40:32] um you know Satan has tried to turn our
[40:37] eyes upon what's going on around us you
[40:40] know Russia and Ukraine getting in a war
[40:44] you know is everything going on with
[40:46] Israel you know homosexuality is on the
[40:49] rise they're trying to push it upon us
[40:52] but brother brandom said you know those
[40:54] are just distractions and not to fear
[40:56] hear that he said it's just turning you
[40:59] away from what's really going
[41:01] on and he's he was just saying don't
[41:03] miss your visitation because this is
[41:06] life or
[41:08] death and we're trying to gain eternal
[41:11] life and make the Rapture because God's
[41:13] in the midst of us trying to reveal
[41:15] himself but Satan's always trying to
[41:18] distract us
[41:20] amen and uh so I just begin to just
[41:23] wanted you to think about these
[41:25] questions what is a
[41:27] visitation and who are you pre pre uh
[41:30] preparing for to
[41:31] come when you know who is coming are you
[41:35] in
[41:37] expectation and an important thing for
[41:39] when you're having a visitation you
[41:41] always want to know when what time are
[41:44] they
[41:45] coming what time are they going to come
[41:48] and how are they going to
[41:50] come God always visits in the same
[41:54] pattern he never breaks his his word he
[41:57] always he always comes according to
[41:59] scripture and that's the only way we'll
[42:02] know what time and when he's coming and
[42:05] what he's going to do and the people
[42:07] he's getting prepared
[42:09] for and he's always wanting us to look
[42:12] for his coming because brother brandham
[42:14] said he'll only come to those who are
[42:17] looking for him amen everyone's looking
[42:21] for a last sign you know in in a couple
[42:24] months there's that so eclipse going on
[42:27] millions of people are coming here you
[42:29] know they're thinking there's people at
[42:32] work you know just they know it's the
[42:34] last last day and they're just thinking
[42:36] this is a sign in the heavens and you
[42:38] know just looking at all the wars and
[42:40] rumors of wars and all this going on but
[42:43] brother brandham said the last sign to
[42:46] the Gentile
[42:48] age he said I just wonder if we're not
[42:50] looking too forward ahead for something
[42:53] that's right by us wonder if it could be
[42:56] the same way if we could pass by our
[42:59] opportunity remember as the day the old
[43:03] types as the types can never break the
[43:06] last sign According To Jesus he said as
[43:08] it was in the days of Sodom lot so shall
[43:12] it be in the days when the son of man
[43:14] not Son of God now when the son of man
[43:17] is
[43:18] revealed looking at here where it's
[43:22] settling
[43:23] today amen and and that's what a lot of
[43:26] people are looking for people are
[43:27] looking for Jesus to come down from the
[43:30] sky though we believe that but that's it
[43:33] is according to scripture but he has he
[43:36] can't break his pattern just just like I
[43:39] read that quote from brother brandom he
[43:41] can never break his word he always comes
[43:42] according to scripture everyone's
[43:44] looking for nail scars and a crown of
[43:48] thorns but he's coming in
[43:51] flesh amen and I just want to bring that
[43:55] out tonight
[43:56] what is the son of man we know it's a
[44:00] prophet um brother brandom said he was
[44:04] the son of man because he had to come to
[44:06] reveal himself to Israel as a prophet
[44:08] and they rejected it and that was the
[44:11] prophecy they they should receive him in
[44:13] in the name of the son of man a prophet
[44:16] because it was according to the word
[44:18] Deuteronomy 18:15 when Moses spoke the
[44:21] Lord your God shall raise up a prophet
[44:23] liken unto me and when he come he ident
[44:26] ID ified himself in his ministry as a
[44:27] man not a son of God Son a man God is a
[44:32] spirit and he revealed himself as son of
[44:34] man what he claimed to be and they was
[44:37] blinded and couldn't see
[44:39] it and it the son of man also means god
[44:43] coming down in flesh the spirit of God
[44:46] will come upon the Earth in a form of
[44:48] human
[44:49] beings God manifested in human flesh
[44:52] amen do you see it and would do the same
[44:55] thing that God did in human flesh at
[44:57] Sodom remember they were waiting for a
[45:00] promised son and right after that the
[45:02] promised son
[45:04] came and a lot of people ask you know
[45:08] why can't God just personally speak to
[45:10] me why a prophet why why doesn't God
[45:13] physically speak to me and if you look
[45:16] in the Old Testament just laying some
[45:18] Foundation here when Moses Moses came
[45:21] down from the mountain there was
[45:23] Thunders and Lightnings and the whole
[45:25] children of Israel was scared and they
[45:27] said unto Moses speak thou for us and we
[45:30] will hear but let not God speak with us
[45:33] lest we die and Amos 3:7 says surely the
[45:37] Lord God will do nothing but revealeth
[45:40] his Secrets unto the servants the
[45:43] prophets he wants to show he wants to
[45:45] uncover he wants to lead us
[45:48] amen amen and um who is this mzc and
[45:52] this is kind of my thought here of the
[45:55] the three comings of the son of man and
[45:58] taking the father dispensation the son
[46:02] dispensation and the Holy Ghost
[46:04] dispensation and that's the the three
[46:06] ways brother brandom said God will
[46:07] reveal himself God and imor who is this
[46:11] mzc he said God and imorph masked in a
[46:15] pillar of fire god and imor and A Man
[46:19] Called Jesus God and imor in his church
[46:23] God above us and the pillar of fire the
[46:27] father
[46:28] dispensation God With Us the son
[46:31] dispensation Jesus
[46:33] Christ God in us the Holy Spirit and if
[46:38] you just look at it with those three
[46:41] comings because God couldn't just come
[46:43] down and reveal himself because we
[46:45] couldn't handle it being in these beings
[46:48] this flesh so God had to slowly condens
[46:50] send down amen and in
[46:54] MDC uh but who is this mzc brother
[46:57] brandom said this man had no father no
[47:01] mother no beginning no ending he was a
[47:05] perfect being and that theophany just
[47:07] spoke grab some dust some dirt flesh
[47:11] that's what we made out of and he just
[47:13] stepped right into it with two other men
[47:15] and he began to walk to Abraham so that
[47:19] Pillar of Fire the father dispensation
[47:21] now and a perfect being brother brandom
[47:25] said that um brother Samuel and I were
[47:27] talking and you know I just like to grab
[47:30] some things from them and my
[47:31] father-in-law and just combined it into
[47:34] one and uh from my favorite preacher so
[47:36] hopefully he doesn't mind me stealing
[47:38] stuff but and uh so brother uh Samuel
[47:42] and I were just talking about it and um
[47:44] brother brandham said that notice if he
[47:47] had no beginning and no end that same
[47:51] God is still
[47:53] here what he did back then
[47:56] he's here today
[47:58] amen so I would just want to take the
[48:00] first dispensation MDC and a theophany
[48:04] body but then coming into flesh um in
[48:07] Genesis 18:1 you don't have to turn
[48:09] there but and it says and the Lord
[48:11] appeared unto him in the plains of
[48:13] mamory and and he and so Abraham and he
[48:16] sat in the tent Door In the Heat of the
[48:20] day and also too I would just like to
[48:23] have you keep a thought in your mind
[48:25] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[48:28] today and forever amen so just keep
[48:32] those Foundation of scriptures and in
[48:34] your mind as we go go through these
[48:37] things um and also don't miss your
[48:41] visitation and brother brandham said
[48:42] that during this time with Abraham
[48:45] Abraham just left all of his family God
[48:48] called him to be separated from all his
[48:50] family everything he ever knew knowed
[48:52] and um he started to walk by faith
[48:56] and uh he began to uh get some uh
[49:00] criticism from his wife um brother
[49:02] brandom said that day they had a fuss
[49:05] that morning and uh Sarah began to um
[49:10] now I know Sarah's a spiritual type of
[49:12] us but uh sometimes you like brother
[49:14] even Samuel said you got to you know
[49:17] sometimes you have to get off your type
[49:18] there so we're just going to look at
[49:19] what Abraham did versus Sarah amen and
[49:23] um so Abraham you know he was 100 years
[49:26] old Sarah was 90 years old and Abraham
[49:30] was always in expectation always
[49:32] preparing cuz he knew what God had
[49:34] promised him he knew he would be a
[49:36] father of many nations and he knew a son
[49:38] would come through him and through Sarah
[49:41] so he was always an expectation of that
[49:44] and uh so they began to have a fuss that
[49:46] morning Sarah was always looking down
[49:48] into Sodom where lot was with his uh
[49:52] Lot's wife you know she had the the
[49:54] latest hair dude she had the latest
[49:57] fashions um she always watched that the
[49:59] brother BR brandham called it a camel
[50:01] Caravan coming through with the latest
[50:03] fashions and that's what Sarah always
[50:05] had her mind on and that's what Satan
[50:08] always wants uh to uh distract us with
[50:10] is to get our minds on the world and to
[50:13] always miss what's coming right amen and
[50:17] um and brother Braham says but if she
[50:19] just knowed there was more than a
[50:21] caravan coming through there was a host
[50:24] of the Lord coming that W
[50:26] amen and uh so and also Sarah began to
[50:30] look at the latest fashions but she also
[50:33] began to say why why' you bring me out
[50:35] here you know kind of just like the
[50:36] children of Israel why did God bring us
[50:38] out here to just to die they're uh it
[50:41] was In the Heat of the day brother
[50:42] Braham said the the land was drying out
[50:45] all his cattle were dying um the
[50:48] herdsmen were being negative but uh he
[50:51] said poor old Abraham he just grabbed
[50:54] his chair
[50:56] and he grabbed his chair and put it
[50:58] right in front of his tent door and he
[51:01] bowed his head amen and he said now
[51:05] Satan was trying to block Abraham and
[51:06] Sarah because he knew that there was an
[51:09] Angelic visitation coming amen and then
[51:13] when everything Rises all out of order
[51:15] then we know something's wrong now I
[51:17] believe maybe if we listen to Satan we
[51:20] might miss miss it seeing it like Sarah
[51:23] did and as as
[51:26] Abraham sat his chair in front of the
[51:28] tent
[51:29] door um a lot of us men our our wives
[51:33] running their mouth and stuff like that
[51:35] we would like to you know bicker back
[51:37] and forth right and that's the carnal
[51:39] thing to do but uh brother brandham said
[51:43] he was always prayed up he was always
[51:46] praying to the Lord and that's why it's
[51:48] it's it's important to always being
[51:50] being in the spirit um to always be in
[51:53] expectation because you never know when
[51:55] your visitation coming and as brother um
[51:58] I'm sorry as Abraham was sitting at the
[52:00] tent
[52:01] door he just bows his head and begins to
[52:04] think about everything that God has ever
[52:06] done for him he begin to think about God
[52:09] Almighty and um and he said also notice
[52:13] he said brother B says I like that when
[52:15] Abraham just sat his sat his uh chair in
[52:18] front of the tent door he goes if you
[52:20] notice lot lot sat his chair at the gate
[52:25] and then he go because the tent door is
[52:27] access to your your dwelling place but
[52:30] the gate or I'm sorry the gate brings
[52:32] you out into the yard amen and that's
[52:35] that's the difference between the elect
[52:37] seat of God versus you know the the
[52:40] world they just want to keep Christ out
[52:43] in the front yard or in the backyard but
[52:45] we want the Holy Spirit to come into our
[52:47] lives
[52:48] amen
[52:51] Amen brother Braham said he kept himself
[52:54] in a spiritual at atmosphere all the
[52:56] time that he could recognize right from
[52:58] wrong all the time that's the way a
[53:01] Christian ought to do today is to keep
[53:03] yourself prayed up under spiritual
[53:06] atmosphere always never seeing never
[53:08] seeing the bad side looking to the good
[53:11] side you are children of God expecting
[53:13] His blessings and that quote just stuck
[53:15] out to me and it's I was listening to it
[53:18] today but that quote just stuck out out
[53:21] to me that never to look at the bad side
[53:23] always look to the good side and if you
[53:25] actually really think about it and get
[53:27] this Revelation that nothing bad ever
[53:30] happens to a son and daughter of God we
[53:32] may think something bad happens to us
[53:35] but the B the Bible says in Romans 8:28
[53:38] that and we know that all things work
[53:40] together for good to them that love God
[53:44] to them who are called according to his
[53:47] purpose amen there may be trials in your
[53:49] life you may be going through dark times
[53:51] just like Abraham where you just don't
[53:54] know where to turn
[53:55] things are drying up in your life you
[53:58] know family may be coming against you
[54:00] you may be you know your job may be in
[54:03] Jeopardy but that's just Satan trying to
[54:06] rob you of your blessing just like
[54:07] brother Brandon was
[54:09] saying and uh and just listening to that
[54:12] sermon again today is there anything too
[54:14] hard for the Lord I didn't catch it the
[54:15] first time but brother brandom actually
[54:17] mentions that verse we know that all
[54:19] things work out for the good to them
[54:22] that love God and I just thought it was
[54:24] a vindication if you could just catch
[54:25] that Revelation I I know we don't like
[54:27] tests and trials cuz it's against this
[54:29] flesh but there's something greater in
[54:31] US
[54:32] amen and brother Braham said she so
[54:35] Sarah she had herself all out of
[54:37] condition to receive to receive it when
[54:39] God brought it oh my don't never get
[54:42] that in your heart be open be ready she
[54:45] missed it she failed to see it Abraham
[54:49] out there waiting with
[54:50] anticipation you see it was made known
[54:53] to her it wasn't made known to her it
[54:55] was made known to them that was looking
[54:58] that's the way it comes yet to those who
[55:00] are
[55:01] looking so as
[55:03] Abraham bowed his head at the tent door
[55:06] he began to think on the Promises of God
[55:09] and when he raised his head he saw three
[55:11] men walking to him and brother brandom
[55:14] said there was there was a cry in his
[55:16] heart to go out and run to him and bow
[55:19] before him and he caught the revelation
[55:21] of not Lords like lot said but he said
[55:24] Lord
[55:26] yeah and when he bowed before him he
[55:29] didn't you know just speak to him just
[55:32] for a little bit and send him on his way
[55:33] he said come and stay let me cook for
[55:36] you I'll give you something to drink let
[55:38] me wash your feet just stay comfortable
[55:41] amen and that's what we need to do
[55:42] tonight is you know we don't need to
[55:44] leave him out in the front yard like lot
[55:46] did or in the backyard amen let him come
[55:49] inside you today
[55:51] amen hallu and uh so Abraham was looking
[55:54] for a sign you know of who this man was
[55:58] amen so this this man came in flesh and
[56:02] um as he sat down he called him by name
[56:06] Abraham where is thy wife and brother
[56:08] Ram said now how did this man know his
[56:11] name when before he was just called
[56:13] Abram and now he had a name change to
[56:16] Abraham and only one man knew that and
[56:18] that was Abraham so how did this man
[56:20] know his name and how did he know he was
[56:23] married and how and he said where is thy
[56:26] wife Sarah he didn't call her sari he
[56:28] called her Sarah so how did this man
[56:31] know amen it it just shows that there
[56:34] was more than a man
[56:37] amen so the the the son of man the that
[56:40] man that was sitting by the tent door um
[56:43] brother brandom dramatizes it his back
[56:46] towards uh the tent and Sarah began to
[56:48] ease drop and uh think about you know is
[56:53] this another man that you know Abraham
[56:55] just going to you know another fanatic
[56:57] guy you know just coming by you know but
[57:00] Abraham you know said this this is our
[57:02] visitation he he told her this is our
[57:04] visitation you know prepare some food
[57:07] amen and as as uh Sarah began to stay in
[57:10] her tent um she began to uh just
[57:13] listening to what the conversation was
[57:16] and this son of man was saying that you
[57:19] know I will I will return to you and and
[57:21] that according to the time of life and
[57:23] you you shall have that child and uh you
[57:26] know as we all know she she began to
[57:29] laugh and um as as she you know and then
[57:32] that son a man said why did why did your
[57:34] wife laugh with his back turned towards
[57:37] the tent he was outside she was inside
[57:39] and she didn't even laugh out loud the
[57:41] Bible says she laughed within her heart
[57:43] so who alone could know um that she
[57:47] laughed inside of her heart
[57:49] amen but we know that Sarah you know
[57:52] even though she lied face to face
[57:55] you know to God that you know she was
[57:57] part of the promise you know and that's
[57:59] you know and that and that's us you know
[58:00] all the times that you know we've fallen
[58:02] short and we've rejected God you know we
[58:05] we're we're connected to to our Abraham
[58:07] which is Jesus Christ
[58:09] amen but as as a son of man began to
[58:12] discern that was one of the signs the to
[58:16] discern and Abraham caught that sign
[58:19] amen and as we know I just uh want to
[58:22] stop there and as we know he received
[58:23] the the promised
[58:25] but shortly right after that that's when
[58:28] Sodom and Gomorrah was destroyed with
[58:30] you know fire and
[58:32] brimstone so that was the father
[58:36] dispensation now we're condenscending
[58:39] down from the father to the son
[58:43] dispensation so this the father
[58:45] dispensation the first one had no mother
[58:48] no father no beginning no ending but
[58:51] brother Bram said Jesus had father had
[58:53] mother had beginning and had an ending
[58:56] because he aged you know he he looked 50
[58:59] years old he had Mary and uh Joseph as
[59:01] his father and mother so
[59:05] um and uh just want to go with um
[59:09] keeping that tight but just remember to
[59:11] keep that Jesus Christ is the same
[59:13] yesterday today and forever in your
[59:15] hearts and so we all know that the the
[59:18] sign of that uh son of man is to discern
[59:21] the heart and the famous story was the
[59:23] woman at the well
[59:25] this this Jesus Christ came to the woman
[59:27] at the well and um this woman brother
[59:31] brandham said she she was a prostitute
[59:35] um she you know her morals were
[59:38] completely gone and she couldn't come to
[59:41] draw water um with the other women who
[59:44] were pure but this this woman at the
[59:47] well we don't know her name but she was
[59:48] not pure so she had to come in the
[59:51] evening time you know um to to collect
[59:55] that water and as she began to walk to
[59:59] the well
[1:00:06] um let me see she began to
[1:00:11] um and brother Bram said she was more
[1:00:13] okay here we are and she came upon there
[1:00:16] with a pot on her head no doubt she was
[1:00:18] going along thinking now the man that I
[1:00:21] married or got a hold last night I'm
[1:00:24] doubting him he's a man he acts funny I
[1:00:28] just don't know about him I haven't got
[1:00:30] a chance I'm out from society and I
[1:00:32] can't go to those
[1:00:34] churches they don't just look at them I
[1:00:36] don't know what to do I'm in
[1:00:39] distress and I've been reading in the
[1:00:41] Bible so she even though she was you
[1:00:44] know a prostitute had her life all all
[1:00:47] messed up in her darkest times she was
[1:00:49] still a Bible reader and she began to
[1:00:52] dwell on those things as she was walking
[1:00:54] to the well you know about about the
[1:00:56] Messiah coming and just like brother
[1:00:59] Bram said he always comes to those that
[1:01:01] are looking for him and she begin to
[1:01:03] think surely someday that Prophet will
[1:01:05] come on the scene now if they know now I
[1:01:09] know they've claimed that there is no
[1:01:10] such thing and this is so maybe a
[1:01:13] hundred years off or a thousand years
[1:01:15] off we've been looking for that for a
[1:01:17] thousand years and it's never happened
[1:01:19] yet so we ain't looking for it now
[1:01:21] everything
[1:01:22] is is so oh no we got churches and
[1:01:25] things we don't need nothing like that
[1:01:26] now so then she's going along there
[1:01:29] thinking about these things and you know
[1:01:31] when she began to think about him that's
[1:01:33] when he appears like we had last night
[1:01:36] when they was on the road to emus when
[1:01:39] she thought on those things she heard a
[1:01:42] man say bring me a
[1:01:44] drink so as she began to dwell on these
[1:01:47] things she was just so caught up with
[1:01:49] everything she heard a voice that said
[1:01:52] bring me a
[1:01:53] drink what about it in her Darkest Hours
[1:01:56] when her morals was all gone maybe a
[1:01:58] pretty a pretty little old lady been
[1:02:01] turned on the street to live like that
[1:02:03] sometimes it's not the little girl's
[1:02:04] fault it's her parents fault to let her
[1:02:06] go out like that and there she was maybe
[1:02:09] her little curls all hanging down she
[1:02:11] was depleted going along weary and
[1:02:13] nobody had anything to do with
[1:02:15] her the child and maybe a big story
[1:02:18] behind it anyhow I know one thing she
[1:02:20] heard she had read the Bible and she
[1:02:23] believed the Bible and there was was a
[1:02:25] little seed laying down in her heart she
[1:02:27] says if it ever happens I I'll know it
[1:02:29] she was predestined predestinated to
[1:02:32] that so as she heard this voice from
[1:02:35] this man bring me a
[1:02:38] drink um she knew he was a Jew uh I'm
[1:02:41] not sure how she knew that maybe just by
[1:02:42] the way he was dressed and she was a
[1:02:45] Samaritan and they just began to have a
[1:02:47] conversation she goes you know we don't
[1:02:49] have anything to do with the Jews you
[1:02:51] know and you don't have anything to do
[1:02:53] with us
[1:02:54] and uh she began so go as God was or as
[1:02:58] Jesus was speaking to her she he began
[1:03:00] to contact her spirit and
[1:03:03] um but uh brother brandom said if if you
[1:03:07] only knew who was talking to you to
[1:03:10] bring me a drink he said listen to the
[1:03:12] reply woman if you only knew who was
[1:03:14] talking to you oh my that's what it is
[1:03:17] today if you only knew who you were
[1:03:18] talking to you would ask me for a drink
[1:03:22] I'd bring you water or give you water
[1:03:24] you do not come here to draw and she
[1:03:27] began to say you know you have nothing
[1:03:29] to draw with but then he just began to
[1:03:31] tell her you know it's not this physical
[1:03:33] water I have something greater something
[1:03:35] that's Everlasting something where it's
[1:03:38] going to you know just um come bubbling
[1:03:41] out of your heart just like that spring
[1:03:43] that brother brandom talked about and so
[1:03:46] she began to have you know um something
[1:03:49] in there as you know brother brandom
[1:03:51] always says he always wants to talk to
[1:03:53] people to contact their spirit and uh so
[1:03:56] first she had a racist Spirit on her the
[1:03:59] Jews the Jews versus the
[1:04:02] Samaritans so then he began to talk to
[1:04:04] her even
[1:04:05] more and uh she had a religious spirit
[1:04:08] on her and she says you know our father
[1:04:11] Jacob dug this well so who do you think
[1:04:13] you know you are you know and and uh but
[1:04:16] Jesus be to say but whosoever drinketh
[1:04:18] of this water I shall give him I shall
[1:04:21] give him he shall never thirst but that
[1:04:24] that water I shall give him shall be in
[1:04:26] him a well of water springing up into
[1:04:28] everlasting life and as she heard that
[1:04:31] brother brandom said she humbled herself
[1:04:34] to the word as she heard those words she
[1:04:37] goes give me a
[1:04:40] drink I don't want you know and the
[1:04:42] woman saith unto him sir give me this
[1:04:44] water that I thirst not neither come
[1:04:46] hither to
[1:04:48] draw and as he began to contact her
[1:04:51] spirit as she humbled herself to the
[1:04:53] word now it gets down
[1:04:56] to um down deep down into her heart
[1:04:59] where no no no one would know this
[1:05:02] except God
[1:05:04] himself and the so this man said to her
[1:05:08] you know go get your
[1:05:10] husband and she said I don't have a
[1:05:13] husband and he said you you said well
[1:05:15] you know uh you have five and the one
[1:05:19] you're living with is not your
[1:05:21] husband so after six Church ages there
[1:05:25] came seven Church ages and standing
[1:05:29] before her was the Christ amen that's
[1:05:32] right that's right she and he brother
[1:05:35] bam says what happened she got all
[1:05:38] excited like this she got into distress
[1:05:40] she said sir I so being a Bible reader
[1:05:44] she said sir I believe I perceive you're
[1:05:46] a
[1:05:47] prophet and he goes and I know that when
[1:05:51] the Messiah cometh see she's expecting
[1:05:54] she's expecting for the Messiah he'll do
[1:05:56] these things what things to discern the
[1:05:59] intents of the heart he goes listen to
[1:06:02] that prostitute ill Fame woman she know
[1:06:05] more about God than half of those
[1:06:07] preachers in the United States she never
[1:06:09] said you're be elub a devil she said sir
[1:06:12] I perceive that you're a prophet now
[1:06:14] listen we know the Samaritans we know
[1:06:17] that Christ is coming we know who is
[1:06:19] called the Messiah is coming who is
[1:06:21] called the Christ's anointed one see and
[1:06:23] when he comes this will be a sign that
[1:06:25] he'll show he'll tell us these things
[1:06:28] you are a
[1:06:29] prophet but we are looking for a messiah
[1:06:31] when this Messiah comes he will tell us
[1:06:34] these things this will be his
[1:06:38] sign so
[1:06:39] her recognizing and being a Bible reader
[1:06:43] she knew about Amos 3:7 that you know
[1:06:46] all things will come to to the prophet
[1:06:48] so he began to discern our
[1:06:50] heart and um and she knew the word only
[1:06:54] comes to the prophets so she was she
[1:06:56] just thought this was just a regular man
[1:06:59] and going to be a forerunner of the
[1:07:02] coming
[1:07:03] Messiah and she expected him brother
[1:07:05] bran to say well the Messiah is coming
[1:07:08] pretty soon you know maybe in the next
[1:07:12] five years or 10 years I'm just a
[1:07:14] forerunner of him but he said I am he
[1:07:18] and as she heard those words then he
[1:07:20] called her then he called her I am he
[1:07:23] that speaks with you see she recognized
[1:07:25] it by the word of God he called her from
[1:07:28] her sins to a life and her name is in
[1:07:31] the Bible and she's got Immortal Life
[1:07:34] today he can call you the same tonight
[1:07:36] because he's the same yesterday today
[1:07:39] and
[1:07:41] forever so she began to break as she
[1:07:43] heard this these words I am he that it
[1:07:45] wasn't just a prophet it was God in
[1:07:48] flesh so now we're at the father now
[1:07:51] we're at the son dispensation God in
[1:07:53] flesh not just a prophet but it was the
[1:07:55] coming Messiah and she began to break
[1:07:58] all traditions of those days it wasn't
[1:08:00] right for a woman to go out into the
[1:08:02] street and woman of that type to talk to
[1:08:04] men but she but she's no one could stop
[1:08:07] her um someone he said try to stop her
[1:08:10] she had found something that was real
[1:08:12] and she said come see a man who told me
[1:08:16] everything that I've ever done amen that
[1:08:18] was the sign who told me everything that
[1:08:20] I've ever done and as we come so we have
[1:08:24] the father dispensation the son
[1:08:27] dispensation and now the Holy Ghost
[1:08:29] dispensation as the son of
[1:08:32] man but the same and I just want to read
[1:08:35] the the same scriptures we opened up
[1:08:38] tonight but the same day that lot went
[1:08:39] out of Sodom it rained fire and
[1:08:42] brimstone from heaven and destroyed them
[1:08:44] all even thus shall it be in the day
[1:08:46] when the son of man is
[1:08:49] revealed and you ask you know you might
[1:08:51] ask why do why do we you know got to
[1:08:54] know these certain things why do we got
[1:08:56] to know these signs and you know I just
[1:08:59] begin to think on that and I've heard
[1:09:01] this said many times but um and I was
[1:09:03] actually talking to my Grandma about all
[1:09:05] this stuff too because you know she's in
[1:09:07] a denomination and everything and she
[1:09:10] struggles with the godhead and all this
[1:09:12] and um but we were on a map or we were
[1:09:16] we were lost and we we were given a map
[1:09:19] but we didn't know where we were or
[1:09:21] where we were going but that's the true
[1:09:23] sign of a Prophet that not only does he
[1:09:25] show you where you are but he's pointing
[1:09:28] to you pointing you in the right
[1:09:29] direction
[1:09:31] amen and you say you know why why must
[1:09:34] we know these things because you know
[1:09:36] even the disciples in Jesus's time they
[1:09:38] missed the coming of John the Baptist
[1:09:41] they missed the coming of Elijah who was
[1:09:43] the Forerunner of Jesus Christ and uh
[1:09:47] that's how important these scriptures
[1:09:48] are and in Matthew 171013 and his
[1:09:51] disciples asked him saying why then say
[1:09:54] the scribes that Elias Elijah must first
[1:09:57] come and Jesus answered and said unto
[1:09:59] them Elias truly shall So speaking
[1:10:03] not past tense but shall future tense
[1:10:07] shall first come and restore not prepare
[1:10:11] but restore all things so it wasn't
[1:10:13] speaking that wasn't speaking of the
[1:10:17] John the Baptist because he was to
[1:10:18] prepare but I say unto you that Elias
[1:10:21] has come already and they knew him not
[1:10:24] but I have done unto him whatsoever they
[1:10:27] listed likewise shall also the son of
[1:10:29] man suffer them then the disciples
[1:10:31] understood that he spake unto them of
[1:10:33] John the
[1:10:34] Baptist and I just want to um kind of
[1:10:38] lay also some Foundation here of just to
[1:10:41] to prove who Malachi 44 is in in our in
[1:10:46] our day um Luke
[1:10:48] 117 um if you could actually just uh
[1:10:51] pull up Luke 117 on the screen but then
[1:10:54] everyone turn in their Bibles to Malachi
[1:10:56] 4 um 5 and
[1:11:01] 6 and this is just something that the
[1:11:03] Lord uh put or showed me not too long
[1:11:07] ago and um with everyone leaving the
[1:11:10] message and people leaving the message
[1:11:13] you know there was a Satan voice was
[1:11:16] saying out there that this coming in
[1:11:18] Malachi 4 was only to the Jews but I
[1:11:22] would just like to show something here
[1:11:25] it's kind of different but um I thought
[1:11:27] I would just do this just to it was a
[1:11:29] blessing to me so um so Luke as we read
[1:11:34] here um so everyone look at Malachi 4 um
[1:11:40] verse uh
[1:11:42] six and there's two turning of the
[1:11:45] hearts so fathers to the
[1:11:48] children put your finger on that
[1:11:51] one and the heart of the children to
[1:11:55] their fathers so put your finger on that
[1:11:57] one
[1:11:59] so now we look up at the screen here and
[1:12:03] he shall go before him in the spirit and
[1:12:05] the power of Elias Elijah and to turn
[1:12:08] the hearts of the fathers to the
[1:12:11] children now which one is that it's the
[1:12:14] first one fathers to the children so we
[1:12:17] know here by scripture that John the
[1:12:19] Baptist only fulfilled the first one
[1:12:24] this is speaking of John the Baptist
[1:12:25] when Gabriel comes to his his father so
[1:12:29] John the Baptist only fulfilled that
[1:12:31] first portion of Malachi 4 4 and5 the
[1:12:35] hearts of the fathers to the children
[1:12:37] you say you know what is the fathers to
[1:12:39] the children brother brandham said it
[1:12:41] was the old Orthodox Jews the
[1:12:45] fathers the law to that's going to a new
[1:12:50] message which was receiving the Messiah
[1:12:53] amen and then the second one the
[1:12:56] children to their to their
[1:12:59] fathers this um brother Bram said last
[1:13:02] day Children of the Kingdom going back
[1:13:05] to the
[1:13:07] Pentecostal uh original
[1:13:09] message but so you know I actually
[1:13:14] talked to a few people well no not a few
[1:13:16] but just one and there's other people
[1:13:18] who say this very same thing that this
[1:13:21] is still to the Jews and and that
[1:13:23] question was always on my mind you know
[1:13:26] and I still believe the message but I
[1:13:27] was like you know Lord you know give me
[1:13:30] something and you know brother BR says
[1:13:31] if you're not sure about something or
[1:13:33] you know just put it on the shelf and
[1:13:35] God will reveal it to you in his
[1:13:37] time so I have this marked down in my
[1:13:40] Bible and uh I just want to share it
[1:13:43] with you guys so keep your fingers on
[1:13:46] those two comings
[1:13:48] now now notice the first Elijah that was
[1:13:52] him
[1:13:54] the second was Elisha the third was John
[1:13:57] the Fourth was the seventh angel and the
[1:13:59] last Messenger to the church according
[1:14:01] to Malachi 4 and Revelations 10:7 now
[1:14:06] the fifth time was his Messenger to the
[1:14:08] Jews okay to the 144,000 to the Jews
[1:14:12] after the church a church is gone and
[1:14:14] brother Bron this is in the fifth seal
[1:14:16] and he goes I just feel a little funny
[1:14:19] he goes see he goes look if some thinks
[1:14:22] I want you to get this now if some still
[1:14:25] thinks that Malachi 4 to restore the the
[1:14:29] people to the same thing is going going
[1:14:31] down to those Jews and think it's the
[1:14:34] same let me just straighten you out
[1:14:36] here let me just straighten this out for
[1:14:39] you he goes just a minute see I would it
[1:14:41] would be a little bit confusing because
[1:14:43] remember Malachi 4 says return the faith
[1:14:46] of the fathers or or he's correcting
[1:14:49] himself or the children back to the
[1:14:51] father see back to the father he goes
[1:14:53] now let me show you the difference of
[1:14:55] this ministry so here's the here's the
[1:14:58] actually I'm going to open mine too here
[1:15:00] so here's the the two turning of the
[1:15:03] hearts if he comes to return so turn the
[1:15:07] heart of the fathers to the children we
[1:15:10] know that's John the Baptist so that's
[1:15:12] the law to the
[1:15:14] Messiah he goes if he comes to return
[1:15:17] the faith to the children back to the
[1:15:20] fathers he would deny Christ so if this
[1:15:23] second one was to the Jews the heart of
[1:15:26] the children it would read the heart of
[1:15:30] the children receiving the Messiah back
[1:15:33] to the law and he said he would deny
[1:15:35] Christ he would go back to the law right
[1:15:38] the fathers kept the law he goes do you
[1:15:40] get it if I had if I hadn't mentioned it
[1:15:44] it' been a little confusion to somebody
[1:15:46] but he told me to mention it so I did so
[1:15:49] I thought I would
[1:15:51] amen amen I hope everyone gets that amen
[1:15:55] that just was just a confirmation to me
[1:15:57] that that's not to the Jews that's a
[1:16:00] separate coming of Elijah because the
[1:16:02] first time the Messiah came the law they
[1:16:05] re They Crucified the Christ so if
[1:16:07] you're saying that this is to the Jews
[1:16:10] they're going back to the law which is
[1:16:12] they're going to crucify Jesus Christ
[1:16:13] again and that's just not according to
[1:16:15] scripture
[1:16:17] amen amen so as we're uh condenscending
[1:16:21] down so the father
[1:16:25] dispensation was
[1:16:27] perfect the son dispensation no he was
[1:16:30] perfect don't get me wrong but he still
[1:16:32] aged he still felt pain he had a
[1:16:36] beginning he had a father and a mother
[1:16:39] but now we're in the Holy Ghost
[1:16:42] dispensation and now God is coming down
[1:16:45] into
[1:16:47] us and just see how he slowly cond sends
[1:16:52] down
[1:16:57] amen and then
[1:16:59] um and we know the familiar scripture
[1:17:02] but in the days of the voice of the
[1:17:04] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:17:06] sound the mystery of God should be
[1:17:08] finished as he had declared his servants
[1:17:11] to the prophets he will be a prophet
[1:17:13] brother Braham said he will be a
[1:17:15] Vindicated as such by by God just since
[1:17:18] Jesus himself in the flesh won't be here
[1:17:22] to vindicate him as he did John it will
[1:17:25] be done by the holy spirit so that is a
[1:17:27] prophet's ministry will be attended by a
[1:17:30] great and wonderful
[1:17:31] manifestation and just coming down to my
[1:17:35] um my scripture that we opened up with
[1:17:39] behold I stand at the door and knock If
[1:17:42] any man hear my voice and open the door
[1:17:46] I will come into him and will Su with
[1:17:48] him and he with me so the first
[1:17:52] dispensation there was a coming of the
[1:17:54] son of man coming to Abraham's tent
[1:17:57] door that was the father
[1:18:02] dispensation the second
[1:18:04] dispensation he came in flesh
[1:18:09] again God above us now God With Us
[1:18:13] knocking at the woman of the the Well's
[1:18:16] heart but now we're here in the last
[1:18:19] Church age in the Holy Ghost
[1:18:22] dispensation
[1:18:23] so it's not good enough to just have the
[1:18:27] pillar of fire above us it's not good
[1:18:30] enough to just have the man with us but
[1:18:34] God is pointing us to God wants to dwell
[1:18:38] in
[1:18:39] man amen and he's standing at the door
[1:18:44] and knocking and brother brand says but
[1:18:47] what does Jesus want what what he wants
[1:18:50] to give you something what's what's the
[1:18:52] point of not knocking that's the reason
[1:18:53] he knocks he's got something for you for
[1:18:57] you there's nothing that could be
[1:18:59] greater than he's wanting to give you
[1:19:01] the Holy Spirit he's wanting to give you
[1:19:04] eternal
[1:19:05] life it's not just some uh beggar at the
[1:19:09] door it's not just some salesman trying
[1:19:12] to sell you
[1:19:13] something um it's it's it's the Messiah
[1:19:17] himself knocking at your door trying to
[1:19:20] get in but as brother you know as we
[1:19:23] heard many times uh brother Samuel say
[1:19:26] God is a gentleman he's he's brother
[1:19:29] brandom goes through that picture of the
[1:19:32] um Jesus knocking at the door and it
[1:19:35] went through the the critics and they
[1:19:37] said Hey where's the door latch but the
[1:19:39] painter said but the door latch is
[1:19:41] inside he's a gentleman he's just
[1:19:42] knocking at your door he's not going to
[1:19:44] kick the door down but he's just
[1:19:46] patiently knocking but brother brandham
[1:19:48] said you know that knock will start real
[1:19:51] loud but as as you keep turning it down
[1:19:54] it will slowly slowly get lighter
[1:19:58] lighter and lighter and I just I just
[1:20:00] pray that you would open your heart
[1:20:02] tonight
[1:20:05] amen and I just begin to think you know
[1:20:08] um just the the profession that I'm in
[1:20:11] you know I've gone to a lot of doors and
[1:20:14] um knocking on people's doors people are
[1:20:17] expecting me to come you know what's the
[1:20:19] purpose of a visitation you know they've
[1:20:21] called us so they expecting me to come
[1:20:24] because me being a plumber there must be
[1:20:27] something
[1:20:28] wrong but what what would be the purpose
[1:20:31] of them calling let's say they have a
[1:20:33] water leak in their house and it's
[1:20:35] flooding their
[1:20:36] basement here I come knocking at the
[1:20:38] door what would be the purpose for them
[1:20:41] to just
[1:20:42] look and tell me to go away when they
[1:20:45] got when they got a problem going down
[1:20:47] in their basement water going everywhere
[1:20:50] what would be the purpose of them to
[1:20:51] tell me to leave let's say they open the
[1:20:55] door what would be the purpose of me
[1:20:58] just standing there at the front doorm
[1:21:01] and just having a conversation with them
[1:21:02] when there's a a water leak in their
[1:21:05] basement damaging all their goods
[1:21:07] damaging their
[1:21:09] Foundation sooner or later that water is
[1:21:11] going to climb and it's going to flood
[1:21:13] the whole house but what good is it for
[1:21:15] me to stay at the front
[1:21:17] door if but that's that's what God wants
[1:21:21] to do he does brother bam said said
[1:21:23] you've only he goes I've I've let I've
[1:21:26] let the Christ in into my heart brother
[1:21:27] Brandon what are you talking about
[1:21:29] preacher he goes yeah but that's all
[1:21:30] you've done he goes you've left them at
[1:21:33] the front door he goes you've accepted
[1:21:35] him as your you know personal savior but
[1:21:38] he wants to be Lord of all right amen he
[1:21:40] wants to have complete ownership he
[1:21:42] wants to be your master he wants to and
[1:21:44] brother brandham talks about many doors
[1:21:47] inside the heart you know we have we
[1:21:49] have closet doors in our house we have
[1:21:51] you know um the bedroom door we have the
[1:21:54] bathroom door we have the pantry brother
[1:21:58] brother Bram said he wants to go to
[1:22:00] every every door in your
[1:22:05] heart and brother brandham said so that
[1:22:08] was just what I mentioned he wants to be
[1:22:10] become Lord of all Lord is ruler
[1:22:13] ownership he wants to own you for you're
[1:22:16] not your own you're bought with a price
[1:22:19] he wants to take control of you so you
[1:22:23] you know you can say well I don't want
[1:22:25] to be owned by anybody well you're
[1:22:27] either going to be owned by Satan or
[1:22:30] you're going to be owned by Jesus Christ
[1:22:31] amen
[1:22:36] amen just a minute preacher I opened my
[1:22:39] heart not too long ago not too long time
[1:22:42] ago and let the Jes Let Jesus in well
[1:22:45] I'm sure happy you did that and maybe
[1:22:47] that's just what you've done open your
[1:22:49] heart and let him in but this is all
[1:22:51] you've done God wants to do something
[1:22:53] else he goes and this what really stuck
[1:22:55] out to me today is God wants to do
[1:22:57] something else he goes look look in this
[1:23:00] scripture behold I stand at the door and
[1:23:01] knock but what does he want to do he
[1:23:04] goes look here in in the scriptures I
[1:23:06] stand at the door and knock If any man
[1:23:08] will open I will come in and suck with
[1:23:17] him now it's talking about having
[1:23:20] Fellowship right come in and S with him
[1:23:24] giving something to eat or him giving
[1:23:26] you something to eat giving you that
[1:23:28] Living Water
[1:23:30] amen so I just begin to think of the the
[1:23:32] son of man um so father son now we know
[1:23:38] that the we've always heard the son of
[1:23:41] man is you know brother brandham brother
[1:23:43] brandham which I'm thankful for you know
[1:23:45] that's that was the the ministry for
[1:23:48] brother brandham everyone everyone
[1:23:50] always reads Revelations 1 through or 10
[1:23:53] 1-7 you know in the days of the voice of
[1:23:56] the seventh angel you know the mysteries
[1:23:58] of God will will be revealed and you
[1:24:01] know I'm so thankful for that tonight
[1:24:03] but we always fail to keep
[1:24:10] reading in Revelations 108 and9 it says
[1:24:14] and the voice which I heard from Heaven
[1:24:15] spake unto me again and he said go and
[1:24:18] take the little book which is open in
[1:24:20] the hand of the Angel which stand upon
[1:24:22] the sea and upon the earth now the
[1:24:24] messenger is
[1:24:28] gone and I went unto the angel and said
[1:24:31] unto him give me the little book and he
[1:24:34] said unto me take it eat it
[1:24:38] up so see we're having we're having
[1:24:40] Fellowship here I will come in and Su
[1:24:42] with him so eat it up and it shall make
[1:24:46] thy belly bitter and it shall be in thy
[1:24:50] mouth sweet as honey
[1:24:53] you know so there's always a wrestle
[1:24:55] between the the word of God between your
[1:24:57] soul and the Flesh in Hebrews 412 for
[1:25:01] the word of God is quick powerful and
[1:25:03] sharper than any two-edged sword
[1:25:06] piercing see the belly bitter it's
[1:25:08] piercing all the way down even to the
[1:25:10] dividing of sunder of the Soul and
[1:25:13] Spirit see it it exposes and discerns
[1:25:16] your your sins it gets you really
[1:25:18] uncomfortable this word comes to make
[1:25:21] you sacrifice when someone rubs you the
[1:25:24] wrong way um when someone you know says
[1:25:28] something to you you you your flesh
[1:25:30] wants to go after you but that that
[1:25:32] belly is bitter um and the of the joints
[1:25:36] of the marrow and the is a desera of the
[1:25:39] thoughts and intents of the heart many
[1:25:40] times we have secrets in our heart
[1:25:42] things we we don't want exposed and
[1:25:45] speaking of
[1:25:46] exposed um when I was sick a few weeks
[1:25:49] ago um I got on Edie Bisal
[1:25:52] um Kick there um somebody posted all
[1:25:56] these Services of back in 1999 brother
[1:25:59] Samuel was actually there and I could
[1:26:01] see him you know shouting and stuff but
[1:26:04] you know and uh you know it's just those
[1:26:06] those Services were just so uh a
[1:26:09] blessing to me and what what stuck out
[1:26:11] to me was um the story of the soldier
[1:26:15] boy um he began to tell that story and
[1:26:19] he and uh brother Eddie Bisal said if
[1:26:22] there's one thing that I ever learned
[1:26:24] from that trip he goes Satan hates to be
[1:26:28] exposed and that that soldier boy was
[1:26:31] committing homosexual acts but once that
[1:26:33] was
[1:26:34] exposed you know that's when he was
[1:26:36] saying I'm I'm free I'm free I'm free
[1:26:38] and that's what the word is doing it
[1:26:41] discerns the the thoughts and the
[1:26:43] intents of the heart so I just want to
[1:26:45] say to you if if you're battling
[1:26:47] something in your life you know a
[1:26:48] besetting sin something that's just
[1:26:51] coming up over over over and over in
[1:26:53] your life um I would just suggest to you
[1:26:56] like brother Eddie Bisal said to just
[1:26:58] every time someone would come up in the
[1:27:00] prayer line brother brandom said you
[1:27:02] should see their face when that Spirit
[1:27:03] knows they're about to be exposed so you
[1:27:06] know if you're just struggling with
[1:27:08] something in your life you know um I
[1:27:10] have and um I would just you know tell
[1:27:14] you to just you know expose that thing
[1:27:16] get prayer you know come to brother
[1:27:18] Samuel have me or him pray for you and
[1:27:22] um
[1:27:22] you know that way you'll be have to have
[1:27:24] a victory in your life amen and this
[1:27:28] quote um is what stuck out to me today
[1:27:32] uh I stand at the door and
[1:27:35] knock now get yourself in a condition
[1:27:38] pull that heart open say Jesus if I if
[1:27:42] ever you worked on me my heart do it now

[1:28:02] have I Let You in everywhere have I Let

[1:28:08] and that that last phrase there really
[1:28:10] stuck out to me goes but have I Let You
[1:28:13] in everywhere to see you so you may have
[1:28:16] left them at the front door and that's
[1:28:18] why you know you may struggle with your
[1:28:21] life and you know say you know I have I
[1:28:24] have God in my heart but you know every
[1:28:26] time you know you know um a trial comes

[1:30:09] softly brother Bram says I challenge you
[1:30:11] let's all stand I challenge you to

[1:30:17] the form of the son of man and human
[1:30:20] flesh through the bride's body accept
[1:30:25] his call it's not just good to have God
[1:30:28] above us it's not good enough to have
[1:30:30] God with us but the only way you're
[1:30:33] going to make the Rapture is to have God
[1:30:35] dwelling inside of you that is the son
[1:30:37] of man the son of man wasn't just for
[1:30:40] brandom brother brandham but it's it's

[1:30:53] believeth on me the works that I do
[1:30:56] shall he do also and Greater Works than
[1:31:00] these shall he do because I go unto my
[1:31:03] father Jesus says I come from my father
[1:31:07] he came as a spirit he was a Spirit came
[1:31:10] from his father into flesh now he went
[1:31:12] to back to spirit amen but he came to
[1:31:15] dwell in in his bride amen and I just

[1:31:21] that you keep
[1:31:23] you know you keep seeing yourself and
[1:31:26] all your
[1:31:28] mistakes but have you really opened up

[1:38:53] spirit
[1:38:55] [Music]
[1:38:58] out you
[1:39:02] know it was wonderful tonight the Lord
[1:39:06] spoke to us
[1:39:09] am you know the things that brother
[1:39:13] Brian read that quote to start out with
[1:39:15] I I love that how the brother Brown had
[1:39:18] mentioned that in that meeting he said
[1:39:20] brother Brown if they can only see it
[1:39:23] then get into
[1:39:24] it you know it's it's just like when
[1:39:27] they troubled the water the angel an
[1:39:29] angel of the Lord would come down and
[1:39:31] Trouble the water at a certain season
[1:39:33] the Bible
[1:39:34] said they didn't know when it was going
[1:39:36] to happen they just had to be
[1:39:39] ready and when you think about it that
[1:39:42] the man
[1:39:44] himself that the Lord Jesus came to the
[1:39:47] same one who sent every Angel yes
[1:39:51] the same one who had touched so many
[1:39:55] came to this man who was there you you
[1:39:58] have to wonder and because you know in
[1:40:00] your own self that how often that that
[1:40:03] man must have thought as he told the
[1:40:05] Lord Jesus every time I'm getting ready
[1:40:07] to get in somebody gets in ahead of
[1:40:11] me but there was an expectation that he
[1:40:15] had in his heart for he
[1:40:18] knew I need to be touched by the Lord so
[1:40:22] he knew he was in the right
[1:40:24] place and how that God came and found
[1:40:27] him right where he was
[1:40:29] at I don't know there's when brother
[1:40:31] Brian was bringing that out about Sarah
[1:40:34] tonight and about the woman at the well
[1:40:36] reading those thoughts just exactly how
[1:40:39] brother Ram described Sarah in that
[1:40:41] message is anything too hard for the
[1:40:42] Lord if you think about it the on the
[1:40:45] road to Emmas as well we think so many
[1:40:49] times that it would be as though that
[1:40:52] our thoughts and our questions would
[1:40:54] push him away but yet when he
[1:40:59] comes what was a key point is that woman
[1:41:02] at the well humbled herself when she
[1:41:06] recognized she was willing to lay aside
[1:41:08] all of her thoughts all of her ideas
[1:41:11] same way on the road to EMAs same way
[1:41:13] with Sarah they were willing to lay
[1:41:15] aside everything and humble themselves
[1:41:18] and you know I believe with all my heart
[1:41:20] heart how the Lord has spoke to us once
[1:41:24] again here tonight the greatest thing
[1:41:26] that we can have is to Tabernacle the
[1:41:30] Living
[1:41:31] God and the prophet would make a
[1:41:34] statement like this in deity of Jesus
[1:41:36] Christ and say that many people he said
[1:41:39] as the Holy Ghost has been received but
[1:41:43] they think it's only church joining but
[1:41:45] he said God it's actually tabernacling
[1:41:49] deity you see it's it's taking what has
[1:41:52] come into your life and allow him to go
[1:41:55] deeper allow him to move deeper in your
[1:41:58] life allowing to move through every door
[1:42:01] you know the first door that he comes to
[1:42:03] is that door of
[1:42:06] Pride it's exactly
[1:42:09] right brother brah says he wants to
[1:42:11] humiliate us amen wants to get us to
[1:42:14] where our will is surrender to him now I
[1:42:17] don't I don't know about you I I
[1:42:19] actually
[1:42:21] early one Saturday morning actually we
[1:42:23] didn't even get to bed it was after the
[1:42:25] last I don't think it was the last youth
[1:42:26] meeting that I had I'm not sure but I
[1:42:29] get
[1:42:30] a Benjamin comes upstairs and thank the
[1:42:33] Lord he was still up at that time and
[1:42:34] said hey we got a problem in the
[1:42:37] basement and um well my wife and I
[1:42:40] worked because I didn't want to call and
[1:42:42] get him up at that time of the night but
[1:42:45] then he came over and like he said what
[1:42:47] what good would it have done to left
[1:42:48] leave him on the front door when I
[1:42:50] called called him ask him I was out
[1:42:53] front I had a shovel cuz I knew where
[1:42:55] the cleanout was I I wanted to see what
[1:42:58] was going on because of what I just had
[1:43:00] to clean up I wanted to know where is
[1:43:03] this at and I I can tell you friends
[1:43:06] that's where we want to invite him in in
[1:43:09] every area of our
[1:43:13] life that's what every area every door
[1:43:17] make sure that you haven't just invited
[1:43:19] him and he's just on the door step as
[1:43:21] Savior but let him be the Lord of every
[1:43:23] area of your
[1:43:25] life I like how brother Shane put it in
[1:43:27] his testimony at the last youth meeting
[1:43:29] he said you know he said when God got a
[1:43:31] hold of my life and I surrendered he
[1:43:34] said there is a savior he said I invited
[1:43:38] him into the door of Music invited him
[1:43:41] in the door of entertainment invited him
[1:43:43] to every door in my life and allow him
[1:43:46] to come
[1:43:48] down and God begin to move and in every
[1:43:51] channel in every area I tell
[1:43:54] you that's one
[1:43:56] thing that we can say here tonight is
[1:43:59] Lord I need more of
[1:44:02] you we don't want to miss our day of
[1:44:05] visitation you know to me when I hear a
[1:44:08] message like this I I don't listen to a
[1:44:10] message any message I don't know how
[1:44:12] many times I go over and over the same
[1:44:15] message sometimes before as I'm
[1:44:18] ministering but to me it just comes out
[1:44:20] more personal every time of what God's
[1:44:24] desire to do is to live his own life
[1:44:27] through
[1:44:30] us that's God's desire and it just just
[1:44:33] requires us
[1:44:34] yielding brother Brian brought that out
[1:44:36] of being just just allowing the spirit
[1:44:39] of God and be open with God say Lord
[1:44:41] I've got this I've got this besetting
[1:44:43] sin I have this in my life Lord I need

[1:55:14] in Rising of the
[1:55:16] Sun that little Eagle was down in that
[1:55:19] barnyard
[1:55:21] sending him a picture of an eagle would
[1:55:23] have never done
[1:55:25] it but Lord
[1:55:27] Jesus you
[1:55:29] came and you
[1:55:31] manifested not only who you
[1:55:34] are but who he
[1:55:37] was Lord that's what you've done Lord it
[1:55:40] say taken the revealing of the son of
[1:55:43] man to bring forth from us Lord who we
[1:55:49] really are
[1:55:50] are Lord that's you coming to Tabernacle
[1:55:55] inside of your people
[1:55:57] Lord Lord every
[1:55:59] scripture the Bible Lord promises after
[1:56:03] promises were
[1:56:05] made we're living in the moment and the
[1:56:08] hour where promises are being
[1:56:11] fulfilled the time Lord that the
[1:56:15] prophets and different ones have longed
[1:56:18] to see this this moment your Prophet
[1:56:20] called it the Golden Age of the
[1:56:24] Gospel Lord
[1:56:28] Jesus as your spirit Lord spoke out here
[1:56:32] tonight may we not miss it
[1:56:35] Lord even Satan's tricks to try to bring
[1:56:40] distractions
[1:56:42] Lord oh
[1:56:45] God may it be the sole priority of our
[1:56:48] life
[1:56:50] to be there
[1:56:52] Lord every single day
[1:56:54] Lord to live in that
[1:56:58] way that I know he's going to take me
[1:57:01] when he
[1:57:03] comes Lord we thank you for the grace
[1:57:05] that you've given to
[1:57:07] us thank you Lord for coming and how
[1:57:10] you've moved upon every one of our Lives
[1:57:13] to override our thoughts I'm so thankful
[1:57:17] there was something on the inside that
[1:57:19] was deeper than our intellect that could
[1:57:23] recognize your presence and submit to it
[1:57:27] Lord father thank you for your mercies

[1:57:49] not ready to go don't let them rest at
[1:57:52] night
[1:57:53] Lord I pray God deal with them at night
[1:57:57] deal with them through the day Lord may
[1:58:00] they get to such a place so miserable
[1:58:03] Lord so because there's nothing of this
[1:58:06] world that can offer any peace there's
[1:58:09] no peace outside of you Lord grant it
