up and down but maybe you'll be able to say you've got your exercise for the day you know I do have a quote for that too but brem says they go and they build all these big gyms and everything else and he says you know he says if well he said if that's all your God is is a big ball of hot air he said but he said you know it used to be when you went to the house of God you got all your exercise in amen it's a privilege to serve the Lord amen and it's just it's a it's something that's so real that it's a joy that even in even in the times in the midst of times of Despair when situations all around us um you know we really don't look so hopeful but I'm grateful there's a joy in the heart of a believer amen there's a there's a real Joy Amen in our lives you love the Lord amen and we just want to remind you as well of the upcoming meetings here at the end of the month uh Memorial Day meetings brother Nathan Bryant will be here with us and you've seen the announcement there on the board and did they make the announcement there'll be a uh meeting after they made that announcement okay for the Sisters to meet in the back conference room um so that will take place uh I want to just have a special prayer here in a moment for my father-in-law um brother Bill had mentioned it and um you know uh where he's uh facing open heart surgery here on Wednesday morning correct so Wednesday morning and you know we when he came up here well when they moved up here I should say and there in in 2020. you know there's things that when he came up here and he was with our doctor and so forth there's certain things that the doctors begin to kind of they begin to pick up on certain things and that was first of all with kidneys and um and you heard him give the testimony before because they had said his his kidneys were not real good or where they were at as far as a stage but you know uh it was in September of uh was it September of 2020 um I think it was brother Andrew was here ministering and um we were he had went to the doctor that week before and so forth they called him our doctor called him on a Sunday afternoon between services and and just told him said hey this is something that just doesn't happen his numbers either they went down or up whatever it was it was a good good thing as far as for the kidneys and so um you know then here just recently they um they had you know talked about some things they wanted to do some tests and so forth with his heart and and of course he don't mind me telling this you're part of the family you're going to get preached on but you know his whole thing is starting out you know sometimes we want to ignore things as though that if I ignore it it'll go away well no brother Branham even told us on how come overcome he says the doctor says you have cancer he says you don't say well no I don't have it no but the god in you is greater than the cancer because when we testify do we testify and say oh no the report was a lie the whole time no we testify and give glory to God why because we knew the report spoke truth but in US as a God who is greater than the circumstances so I was thankful when he uh relented and I did not have to go over and have any pastoral pressure or son-in-law Force upon him to get those tests we have a good relationship I love my in-laws and they tolerate me I'll say that but anyhow he went for that test and you know what the other day when they wanted to go in for the catheter and we had prayer there on Tuesday and I just you know I've had a piece throughout it throughout the time and and the peace you know you understand what I'm saying sometimes when you have peace it's not that I have a word from the Lord that this is how this is going to be it's just it's a piece I I don't know the outcome because sometimes when we have a piece and we we even have thoughts sometimes on how we want things maybe or men would like to hear it go this way we all do that right and um so but anyhow when the news came you know that it was going to have to have the open heart surgery you know you say brother Sammy where we at well I was just at peace because I know it was there was peace all along and I'm just thankful what I'm thankful for as I told him the other day I said I'm grateful how God so all how God so sovereignly moved everything because if you had been living still where you were there were things not being picked up and attended to like they needed to be so I thank God brother bam called doctors God's agents called him God's agent so I I know you know it's just like there's you know people want to talk about doctors and police officers and teachers in fact we could bring it all across the board you know waiters waitress all across there's there's always good and there's bad but you know I mean you don't you don't say I had a bad waiter I never go into another restaurant okay but anyhow you know and I think the doctor was a good doctor but you know I'm just God has everything in his in his purpose and so I just we want to have prayer for him and I don't mean to take up so much time I would do it for anyone because I've done that but I want us just to have a special prayer amen and just to pray over brother Tommy and I want you to also pray from a mother-in-law as well it's also a a great time as well we could understand that you know from that realm of a spouse where there can be a a lot of nervousness within it as you go into it but I'm just going to ask that we just join our hearts together that not only God will just be present there too direct the surgeon and all of that team and I believe he will but I'm asking that he'll just come in such a way to give them just such a arrest even in these next few days and of course I think my father-in-law gave you that testimony and how the Lord just spoke to his heart and and I tell you when they told me that the other night at the house I just started having a time you know I just it's just so wonderful you know I rejoice when you hear God bless his people it's just tremendous and so we want to just have special prayer amen for our brother and also for my mother-in-law that the God will just also just give her also I know she has a piece but you understand especially sisters you would understand that entering into this moment and I don't think anyone could probably enter into it as well as you could to enter in for prayer for her in this time as well so uh if we could I'd like to have a brother Tommy just come on and um musicians thank you this morning God bless you um Brothers I'd like the brothers to come and let's just let's have prayer here with brother Tommy and we're going to pray over a prayer cloth and um maybe mama don't you come on over here too as well and um we'll give you permission to hold his hand love you all Lord Jesus as we lord God come into this moment Lord knowing that father that you have never left us alone Lord You're mindful Lord of every single need and every step in our life Lord dear God we're thankful that Lord that you're right here with us to guide us and direct us through every moment Lord and I pray that father is here as he enters in Lord to this Lord pathway Lord your God with the surgery I pray that God that you would just move down in such a special way Lord we're asking that you would just guide and direct the Lord God the surgeons there that day Lord I pray that you would just move Lord in such a special way God of a healing and a recovery Lord God I pray Lord we're asking that Lord no matter what the Lord has even in the past oh god with these men that Lord that they have the talents and skills and abilities that you've given them but we ask that Lord that you'll be the cheap surgeon Lord God and we pray heavenly father that God you will just grant Lord just a real healing Lord through all of the process strength Lord God and Lord even in the days Lord God that our head Lord may you father I pray as you Lord have spoke to his heart Lord may you continue Lord to visit him Lord and give him strength Lord day by day Lord and I pray God for sister Linda Lord I'm asking that God that you would strengthen her Lord oh God May there be just such a peace Lord we ask oh God for that great opium lord of the lily of the valley oh God that has moved into our souls Lord that you would move Lord in a way oh god there would be such a peace Lord from him who is the Prince of Peace oh God lord to move Lord on the scene for this need Lord we just commit our brother Lord into your hands Lord and we're so thankful God for your oversight in our life we love you and we thank you Father in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you bless you love you love you amen oh amen let's um if we could let's we'll stand and want to read the word of the Lord I want to say God bless you amen I want to go to Hebrews chapter 11. and verse 23 is where I'd like to read from here and we were speaking about getting into that place last week of being anointed to serve the purpose of God and we begin to speak about Moses and I want to speak a little bit more if the Lord will help us this morning on this on this part of it with Moses but I'd like to take the thought and just pray the Lord will help us this morning that it would be a a real blessing and an edification or things that God has just spoken touched my heart in looking and coming into this here and we want to just let the Lord just ask that he'll have his way amen I want to just speak on that thought of influenced from another Realm in Hebrews 11 23 by faith Moses when he was born was hid three months of his parents because they saw he was a proper child and they were not afraid of the king's commandment by faith Moses when he was come to yours refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer Affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season is steaming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward by faith he forsook Egypt not fearing the Wrath of the king for he endured as seeing him who is invisible through faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of blood lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them and by faith they passed through the Red Sea as by dry land which the Egyptians are saying to do were drowned and I just I want to just read this little quote here a portion taking out we referred to it last week but it's one of those quotes that just as one of us something just to really chew on brother Brown says this and why Christ speak and he breaks in on this with talking about Moses and he says God has got a purpose of you being here if you can only be or get to that place how much trouble you save God and yourself too God's got a purpose now God's purpose I want to just say this before we begin God's purpose being revealed is not that you know every step of the way or even every Junction but God's purpose is that our lives would be yielded and surrendered to him because it's God knows what the purpose is and God is the one to fulfill that and achieve it through our lives as we'll yield to him so God's got a purpose and we just we're called just to yield to that may God bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated amen amen will you be in prayer this morning in second Corinthians 4 17 as we look at this point of influence from another Realm Paul says it like this for our light affliction and I say God I that's the place I want to get to is where I can call the tests and trials and things that comes light afflictions you hear what I said I said that's the place I want to get to I'm aiming there which is but for a moment now when Paul writing this he's not writing it to put himself above the people but remember this is the spirit of God that's coming down through a mortal that has met God face to face and these words are meant to capture our hearts that we can then look at things correctly that we see before us or that we're experiencing that in reality even when things seem as though they are going to overwhelm you or you may feel overwhelmed David said when my heart was overwhelmed lead me to the Rock that's higher than I for thou has been a shelter for me so this is the holy spirit calling us to recognize this is a light Affliction which is but for a moment but it worketh for us a far more exceeding an eternal weight of Glory how many know that the tests and trials that we go through as a Believer is what actually molds and shapes your character even where you're at in your journey because the Bible tells us that that all the way in Proverbs and Paul picks it up in Hebrews that there is no one no son cometh unto God but he is chastened he is tried and God deals with our hearts and the Bible says if we endure chastening then God deals with us as Sons so there's always there's tests that are always placed before us but I pray that God would help us to have this kind of a sight that where we can look at the things that are before us and say that's only for a moment if we can just look at the test or trial and recognize them just just say it in that way this is just a moment but the same sometimes there's been things that I've went through for a month or a month it's just a moment if we can just I'm not making light of that you understand but if we can just say this is for a moment to consider and weigh it against eternity no comparison Verse 18 while we look not at the things which are seen they're here before us we're not looking at them though and look means to where we become enamored or taken or occupied or our Mind's Eye everything is channeled into it we see them but but he says we are not looking at the things that are seen But at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal and I just say it like this when we consider the realm of influence and being influenced from another realm we realize that we are affected by the realm that we're born in and uh you know it's just like for example a person that is born in a certain country they begin to take on the customs and whatever of their country and certain things that will be done you know many times you've heard where there's been those that left here uh and they went over into another country and then they begin to take the ways of that country and they begin to be affected by the influence they were in right uh I think of it I'm just going to use your brother Joshua brother Joshua how many years you've been here now brother justway eight years but here just even a few years ago when he went back to his homeland there of Congo and I'm going to tell this he called me on the phone he had you know when he lived there you don't think about the driving how the driving's going on and some of you that's been in the third world countries you realize you know you just get in the car by faith and it's exactly right when he called he says I don't know I can do this you know looking at it right here and I said look I mean just give an example when I went to the other places Philippines or whatever I just tried to get in the back seat behind the seat so I don't see anything in front of me and I said one thing I'd do is say Lord this is as natural to them as us driving on the streets here and that's and that's how that I face it and I deal with it as well as to know that God has this therefore purpose so I want to just say that there are things that even like what brother Joshua he begin to be affected by the influence of how things are done here and the way you drive here sidewalks are not another place to drive on right I mean you know there's certain things and you you begin listen you know what I'm talking about where you live in certain places and even cities in the states here you can look at somebody and say what city are you from or what place are you from because there's an effect by the influences that are around and I really think in this hour that we're living in it has been almost a thing to wear because of the global interface it has become something that has worked to affect no matter if somebody lives in a big city or they live in a rural place and because of everything no more can you look at it and say wow those Styles they must be coming from a city no you see whatever images are coming on from that City or out here sometimes in farm country right the worldwide web where people getting stuck that's right but we're affected your influence the things you take upon customs and whatever more and we so we understand there's an effect and I want to just say it in this way that every one of us as believers through time through our lifetime have been affected and influenced by this other world and I'm talking about this this world that God by his grace has we have been birthed into this realm that's more real than the realm that we currently walk in in other words it's more real than these senses there's something that is more real that I haven't worked myself up you haven't worked yourself up but it's something that's more real than my seed my taste my feel my smell it's more real Than My reasonings my imaginations because when all of those things can only testify of what we see right here and the information that's taken in from things that are visible but there is a contact with another world and there's a different information there is revelation that's coming from The Unseen realm and when it's dropping into our hearts it affects our lives so much that people can look at us and they can look at you look at your decisions and say that don't make sense that don't sound right but what it is decisions you're making right now is under the influence of another Realm let me just continue to work with this because when we see this being affected and influence we are I believe this as Believers God even as we're coming to the point and place we come to it in our lives where where we meet the Living God almighty God who reveals and brings to us a reality of why that we could never settle into this world and I thank God for them we all try to as teenagers and everything else you try to fit in truth right you're trying to keep up why because that is what the world presents as a source of comfort if I can only get the latest style if I can only do this then I'll have comfort then I'll have peace but that's Satan's objective and we never overcome the world that way but the world actually overcomes and dominates our life right and we see it now even on the rise even within young people I I think over the past years and it's not in the in the poor communities it's among the very affluent communities the suicide rates and everything among young people and you know the things that are being said clear out there is things that are coming across from the internet and from media and whatever more let me just say this to you we are not exempt from those things that's why the token must be applied and when I say applied it's applied to every situation even for our children that don't have the Holy Ghost we apply the token as a filter for everything and judge it by the word so we're affected by that an influence to where we've become pilgrims and strangers Brethren would say it like this I want to read these two quotes to you so it'll further maybe come clear on the influence from another realm brother Ram said just below the regions of mortal beings lays the realm of demon power just above that lays The Souls of the unjust below it lays the very domain of Satan in hell then just above us lays the Holy Spirit then under the altar lays The Souls of the just men and the next is God himself so brother Brandon is laying it out of here we understand the seven dimensions time light and matter is where we live fourth dimension television raised the cell phone all those other things that are coming through Fifth Dimension is that of hell yeah is that right we're The Souls of the unjust the sixth Dimension is that of The Souls of the just and the seventh Dimension is where God is dwelling himself so here we are right uh smack dab in the middle that's how brother Branham is placing him just above us lays the Holy Spirit then under the altar lays The Souls of the just men the next is God himself one going downward one going upward the two Spirits are here on Earth influencing the people of this Earth true he goes on in demonology and he's talking about a channel and he says he goes into here uh where I want to start there where it says there's a channel like this and that's where Mortals live in here so there's a channel where Mortals live that's where that's where we live all Mortals live in it's a conglomeration of gaiety Blackness and sin and every once in a while you'll see a little white spot or a light and Jesus said you're a light that sits on a hill don't light a candle and put it over in a bushel how many knows that Paul said we were sometimes Darkness but now are you lighting the Lord what light are we talking about we're talking about God is light we're talking about God that has come to light up our life and every once in a while you see a little flicker of Darkness it would it would be like that we'd look there you know where you have in a very dark dark room and striking up a match well no matter how small the light is the darkness cannot overtake the light the light will pierce the darkness and to see that in the time and the hour and where we're living here the light of God that shineth forth that same light that John writes of that lighteth every man that cometh into the world this same light has lit the believer and that's what is among this conglomeration listen this Darkness I remember down in Egypt the Bible said there was a darkness that covered the land that could be felt it was pressure Isaiah 61 says gross Darkness shall cover the people well what is that gross Darkness it's demon powers but how are those demon powers in a place of influence upon people's lives because listen those Spirits were released in Revelations 9 the Bible said there was one that came falling this Angel didn't descend he got kicked out he was descending but he had a key to the bottomless pit and he loosened up and here we find there was a hundred thousand thousand demons that were released but when were they released against they were released against that of the Jews right there were men like Hitler and Stalin and brother Brown said they were channels that then Spirits could come through but God had to get his people back in the Homeland for the Messiah to be made manifest there is a promised visitation of a hundred and forty four thousand Hallelujah and the same thing now those Spirits you say well well you know Stalin and uh uh you know Hitler and all that you know the Bible said in Genesis 6 here's a repeat the Bible said in Genesis 6 that the Earth was filled in the days of Noah with violence through them do you realize the only way like in this building we the only way we get electricity here is because electricity has been brought to this building and it's wired up for it do you realize violence could have never got into the Earth those acts if there hadn't have been lives that were channels for that violence to come through and be made manifest I said God there was a man on Earth by the name of Noah may we be counted as channels like Noah where God said in the midst of this Darkness there is a man who found Grace in the eyes of the Lord that God would reveal himself and his plans before the impending of Destruction brother Graham said that's Christians in this conglomeration of this dimension of Mortals going this way downward and the next soul is The Souls of the unjust who died not knowing god the second is demons and the third in the Trinity is Hell unless souls and unjust Souls demons and Hell there's a trinity here one of them was caught into the third heaven talking about Paul the first is a ghost too the Holy Ghost so going this way it's the Holy Ghost below it's demon power right now the first is that goes to the Holy Ghost second is Angels third heaven itself now these mortals in this Dimension here is influenced either from there or from here so that's why that when we recognize in this time in this hour and where we are living as every uh child of God that has lived upon the Earth since the Fall In the Garden of Eden where there was Eve came under the influence of deception and she surrendered and look what it brought forth it brought forth a king is that right she came under that influence when was that influence doing it it talked to her it moved upon her listen it moved her by way of unbelief let me just say this unbelief is also an anointing as faith is an anointing unbelief is an anointing doubt is an anointing I'm saying this clearly it's not just when we say oh that's just a thought it's a spirit when something comes to you and wants to make you doubt it's a devil it may not be the Devil Himself but one of his imps but the thing of it is is to recognize what it is that it's a spirit that's coming against you and he's there to try to hinder he's there to try to torment he's there to try to tear you down and he would like you to get you looking at this realm right here in your five natural senses and in your spiritual senses what do I what must I do live by the sense of Faith that'll call those things that are as though they are none brother Samuel I may not feel it it don't matter if you feel it God said it it is true it is amen my feelings don't have nothing to do with it let me tell you when you make a stand for God and a stand for God's word you say what will happen I'll tell you what will happen when Stephen they were stoning him to death let me tell you the lamb himself stood up to welcome him home you may not be able to see it here in this Dimension with these natural eyes but let me tell you there is a cloud of many witnesses that have stood faithful through tests and trials and let me tell you something there's an action of the holy spirit all Heaven is behind this revelation glory be to God all these great qualities I I don't have time to spend upon it within Moses but every one of these great qualities of Faith as we read about in the scriptures are opening texts of these the faith that was within him as far as Moses himself he had so come under the influence of this realm that was leading upward although if we can say it like this Moses had not had his personal experience with God to where his faith would become anointed but he had a mother he had some parents and if you'll notice the opening scripture uh Brianna go back up to the very first scripture I read if you'll notice that opening scripture it starts out with by faith Moses when he was born and you would think wait a minute it speaks as though he was before he was born well as a real son and daughter of God we were we existed in the thoughts of almighty God and you look and say was hit three months of his parents Moses didn't hide himself three months but his parents were abiding in the promise of God and when God met his daddy Abraham and yoshabelle that they were so influenced by the Unseen realm their faith had already been anointed Moses Faith wasn't anointed but they became such channels of divine influence to where the promises of God Moses knew about him can I say it like this that Moses's parents were not dependent upon the pastor or the Sunday school teacher or somebody else but they said God you have given us this child and our life is going to be a source of influence if there's things they're going to know they're going to know about God's word I don't want them I don't want him to be tangled up with Egypt I don't want him to know about all the ways of Egypt I do not want him to look at excelling in the ways of Egypt I want to have Christ set before him at all times think about it he lived in Pharaoh's house but think about what was in Pharaoh's house his mama was there in Pharaoh's house she was an influence she did not encourage him in the ways of Egypt did he have to have an education sure but we recognize when you look what was the main undeniable Focus that was present there his mama was a Channel of influence of the supernatural that she had met somebody say preach we have such a stewardship and a responsibility that here is in this and I'll say what a privilege what a privilege but our lives can be a source of influence but I don't want to I don't I don't want it to be an influence that'll take somebody away but they want to be an influence that it causes lives to be challenged and I'm not talking about being put down I'm talking about encourage to recognize that God the way that God would work through a life like that and what's the objective what's the motive what's the main focus in our life oh brother Samuel you you just too much you just you lived in this should we do too much you talk you act like we ought to be monsters I'm not acting like we ought to be monks but I'm saying it ought to be such a predominance in our life I'm talking by the word of God that it should not be a question of who and what is first place in our life not what we say it's what we do and the church said we're influenced by realm leading upward notice and because of this influence Moses is steamed he didn't even have the Holy Ghost yet his faith wasn't even anointed but he has stinged the reproach for Christ to be identified remember out of the same window same window Pharaoh looked and Moses looked and Moses looked out the same window faith not anointed yet could look out there and he saw the people of God who gave him eyes to see things that way his parents preach somebody his parents in the word that was setting under listen we don't want to look around we should not be walking around as defeated Christians that's not how the word is guiding us it even doesn't matter where you're sitting at right now this morning we're here right now that we would go upward we want to be under the influence of an upward pull we're being pulled upward come up hither and we all have to deserve we have to reflect friends listen one of the greatest things I know everybody's got mirrors I know that but one of the greatest things that we could do is say God help me to really reflect down in my life and I really mean that that we pray God help me to reflect where I'm at everybody heard the story about the in-person new clothes well I don't want to have to tell it but somebody came and deceived him and had him walking out there completely nude and he thought he had on a good piece of garment I'm telling you we want to be sure when we're looking in the mirror of God's word lord it's an examination for my life I mean certainly we're not all sitting here this morning because we're right on man we're on a roll a plus Christians it's not because we're honor roll or a plus Christians we have come to the house of God not for our strong points to be highlighted but our weak places to be exposed why because God doesn't want us living beneath our privileges because who knows the choices and decisions that you have before you or your children are the rest and it's going to be very very crucial that you're under the influence of the right Realm and let me just say this Satan's Duty is to always bring you into this realm he can't bring you to Hell once you pass from Death unto life but his desire is to bring you right here and get so occupied remember when the prophet was standing there on the platform and that Maniac came up and he spit there in his face it's running down and here brother Brown feels it he sees it hears the threats all those things but then brother Adam says I chose to begin to think different thoughts and the police officers came out and said should we lay hands on him he said no this is not a flesh and blood Affair he realized though flesh and blood is standing before him that this man is under the influence of another Realm and when he made the challenge he did now notice the prophet said I chose to think different thoughts and the thoughts he began to think brother I've said instead of despising that man I started looking and saying no doubt he's a good man got a good home got a good family and this and that he don't want to be that way what was he doing entering in for intercession it invited the mighty conqueror the holy spirit because that man I don't care Brethren been a good boxer that man would have whipped him all over why he was anointed and inspired with demon power is that right but here the prophet chose and in the midst of that moment and here came the influence from another realm here came the chief Captain the Mighty God who was over and greater where even those angels and demons that had fallen and was anointing this man they were under that of the mighty creator that they had been created in the beginning but they fell and here was one with the greater Authority how can that be because a Son of God was standing there and yielded himself and there came an influence from another Realm I said God help us like that because the battles are always all around us oh my sometimes we can get so busy about talking about can you believe can you believe can you believe and when missing opportunities for the influence from another Realm because this is just a moment now it depends you can make it a lifetime but keep on talking about it dwelling on it make posters of I've been hurt posters of offenses posters of a and every time you go you're Waltz I'm talking about in here your walls become decorated with offenses Nobody Knows the devil no the devil don't do that it depends on whether or not that we will take that the high I said God let us live under that influence of that realm that can really bring real healing real Deliverance real truth to our lives so he had a he had a a choice Moses made a choice he had he esteemed the reproach of Christ greater riches in the treasures in Egypt because he had recompense unto the reward and to think how that Moses himself you know different statements here that I I just you know in Reading over of how that Moses his faith this Faith he was able even in that time as a young person by the grace of God to be able to look beyond all of the glamor of the world that was around him think about everything that was around Moses at that time everything that Egypt it was right there at his fingertips but Moses didn't pay any attention to it are you with me it didn't say he didn't see it he didn't give no time to it remember that's why the prophet said in greatest Bible fought don't stop to listen keep on going don't pay any attention to it the devil tells you you never get the Holy Ghost look beyond that God made the promise a man didn't make you that promise the prophet didn't make you that promise God made the promise and he sent a prophet in this hour to let you and I know what our real god-given rights are the devil can say you're no good you'll never be able or I just heard the prophet say yesterday morning in the token message he said no matter where you're at no matter what you've been in no matter the mess there has already been a perpetuation made for you that you can go free that's worship the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ and say I Ain't Gonna Worship in my mistakes I Ain't Gonna Worship my failures I am not going to worship all of the reasons why I can't he said I could he said it's mine and I'm going to take it news he looked Plum over into tomorrow you got to hide your eyes from this present world how do I hide my eyes by looking at the right thing you got to be looking and get occupied with the right thing and looking me on till tomorrow Moses couldn't look and realize judgment is coming upon Egypt his faith wasn't anointed yet but he had Faith within him what had increased that Faith to that place you say intellectual faith it was what had brought that about even the parents laying in and how that they were laying in the promises of God and reminding listen they would remind him God spoke to us and announced that your birth was coming on they could remind him the pillar of fire came in the room and hung over where you're at they could remind him that when all the rest of the children were being delivered to the crocodiles we were moved by the spirit of God because of what God spoke to us God opened up a way when we didn't even know how we were going to get through that time we thought for when there was a thought that went through our mind this here we are holding crocodile meat but there was something that rose up that rebuked that thought that wanted to come in our mind why because God had spoken who can but prophesied God spoke to us you're a proper child and you've been hit for three months and God revealed the hiding place and the hiding place is make an ark and Pitch it with tar you see we've had the trust in Moses for every step of your life we didn't know how things were going to be when you got in middle school but we've had to trust God but there's one thing about it think about it when they sent him off they did not become less of an influence they became more of an influence upon his life I tell you if his mom and daddy had succumbed to that of Egypt and they had fostered the pleasures of Egypt there's no telling what would have happened to Moses but they went right into the house of pharaoh right into Satan's Eden and they said there is a channel of what God has done for our life this is what the token is that you have confidence that what the same God has done for you and changed your life he will also change the lives of your children hello brother Samuel we cannot control the time I know that I realize that we do not control the time of oh my you know I should have done this and I should have done that listen friends I believe in youth camps I believe in getting together if there's only one thing we ought to be supporting we ought to be supporting where the young people are getting into the presence of almighty God now y'all believe that what's on my heart that's what's very important but I believe that if we just leave it to those types of things we miss the responsibility and Duty that God has called us to what if I as a pastor left you to just a place of just special meeting after special meeting you would go from Mountaintop to Mountain Top to Mountaintop and we never know how to live a real overcoming Christian life because fruit does not grow on the mountains but what happens on the mountains inspires you for the valley times it's where fruit comes out of your life that's where the fruit of what God has done in your life that's why with the ministering the word Let It Be an influence from that other realm that's influencing you when you come in here oh you might feel so down you might be looking at circumstances that are before you but here under the presence of almighty God the very thing that was gloomed begins to be pushed back what is that that is the light of almighty God the influence coming from another Realm encouragement Hallelujah he knew that judgment was coming his parents had told him that and that's why when they offered him positions you can be this you can do this they offered him but this is what he said I ain't a son of pharaoh I'm a son of Abraham you see there have been such a cultivation there have been such a brother sister that's just not in our home that's why the word the message of the hour has come to you and I it's to cultivate the Sons and Daughters of God what is it it's God moving Upon Our Own thoughts it's God moving upon our own lives that we're not looking in a mirror of defeated and always walking in Gloom but to recognize who you are and you're not the devil's punching bag You Were Meant to torment hell the Son of God was manifested to destroy the works of the devil and let me tell you the Bride of Jesus Christ is manifested to destroy the works of the devil the manifestation of Jesus Christ in your life is to destroy every whole Every curse every claim that's ever been on your family what's happened the abstract has come upon the sea to anoint your faith to look beyond all of the shortcomings look beyond all of the inabilities of life and say I am a super super human being come on I'm writing the word until that super sense has come we're just human beings but when faith has come there has been a super super sense that's moved in and now it is greater than every other sense and see that's the sense that's where that's where we want to live from like we're looking at on Thursday night I'm not a son of pharaoh when things come around I'm not a son of pharaoh I'm a son of Abraham well this is how our family always I'm not a son of pharaoh come on Friends oh brother Sammy you don't know brother Sammy how long my mom and dad have been in the message you don't know how how long well it don't matter how long the genes themselves are still sons of pharaoh come on we don't get where we are because of natural genes and we've said on a message Pew so long that ain't it that sin that sonship and daughter of God it come predestinated from before the foundation of the world amen and God never lost sight of you see what brother Samuel it's got to take God to bring that quickening it does it does take God to bring that quickening and sometimes let me just say it across the church sometimes even across the church it can take an eagle a long time to recognize they're an eagle it can take a long time but what's important is there's an influence from the other realm that is greater and more powerful and is able to break the yoke by the anointing of the Holy Ghost shedding down it'll break that yoke of depression it'll break that yoke that of doubt it'll break that yoke of despair [Applause] you see that Eagle Eye it lifts us above to be able to see tomorrow we all realize what what we deal with today is because of decisions from yesterday is that right lot himself did not he didn't pay attention to the decisions he was making it cost him it cost his family right I could talk about Jacob too in some of the decision but I'm going to do that today I I want to stay here but I'm just saying we realize decisions are important decisions are very important of our life now let me say something decisions themselves do not undo predestined predestination cannot be undone no more than it can be merited are you with me this is why brother bran says find the purpose that God has you here for and you'll save yourself a whole lot of trouble and God a whole lot of trouble because the predestination does not mean that it's going to keep me from every bad decision or decisions made because sometimes there's decisions that lives have to live with they've made decisions right it's like right now today here you are you can be completely full of the Holy Ghost and you make a bad financial decision guess what you got to deal with it you got to deal with it and it's a bad decision and you realize wait a minute how did this happen definitely I was not really submitting under the influence of the Holy Spirit boy it got quiet in here now glory be to God but friends it's so true in our lives why you say brother the same and where would that be in scripture okay I'll give you two places the Bible said stand you fast in the Liberty wherewith Christ and made you free and be not entangled again in the yoga bondage don't let things get you down here and bound in this world the Bible tells us Paul tells us in the book of Timothy that no man that woreeth a good Warfare a good soldier entangled himself with the Affairs of this life there are things that we have to attend to there's things in the natural I hate doing there's times I I I maybe shouldn't use the word hate but I don't know how to say it I mean I don't feel like you know I don't I don't enjoy making out certain bills or having to make you know call around and find out who's my electric supplier going to be and look I don't enjoy that right but I will tell you what I do I said God help me to make the right decision I'm asking him I want his Direction because sometimes those things of Life can get you so stressed out and that's what Satan's objective is because when you get stressed out you no longer are acting like a son and daughter of God you're acting like a son of pharaoh or a daughter of pharaoh but I'm saying how can you say that because there is one who's in control before there was ever a sin he was already a savior my father was ever a sickness he was a Healer it's like the Robin says brother Brown dramatized that from a story and he said these Robins are looking around they're humans and he said good Lord look at him high blood pressure and everything else and they're running around all stressed out he said I wonder you know when Robin looked the other said I wonder if they maybe they don't have a Heavenly Father Like We Do all right that's good now you know what I'm preaching is real these are things we have to battle against I'm trying to get somewhere we battle against this it isn't that all of a sudden we step over here and all of that battle is gone no now you're in a battle and the battle because really before you wasn't in so much of a battle you were pressing on with God but now every gun out of hell is trained on you but greater is he that's in you brother Samuel the devil's been bothering me good he don't got you he's been bothering Mike because you're tormenting hell what should you do give him some of his own medicine [Music] that's why Paul could say in second Corinthians 5 7 we walk by for we walk by faith and not by sight because faith can look at God's worst and it'll steam it Greater Moses saw a people with the promise Pharaoh looked down and said foreign worthless people worthless promise not Moses he had respect to the reward I want you to listen this I don't have this this quote up there but I want you to listen this statement this is very very important I'm going I'm trying to get somewhere here this morning Faith doesn't look at the present time I know sometimes that's the challenge like really the present time presently what we are facing presently what we're going through or presently decisions but listen Faith does not look at the present time let me just let me deal here Faith doesn't see this here Faith looks to what God wants and it works accordingly that's what faith does it sees what God wants and what God wants done and Faith operates through that so faith is a long-ring vision it don't lower its sight it holds to the Target so you see Satan's objective is to keep things in present time but Faith looks beyond the present and sees the future if I keep going this way that's why a person you can sit here today and whatever condition you're in if you remain in that condition you know where you'll be found if you're lost and without God if God listen if there's not a change that's made within that right now tomorrow is going to give witness of the decisions that was set before you today is that right but Faith does not become occupied or entangled in just present Affairs sometimes listen friends the enemy can get so much on he said she said and this and that and you know my family this and this and all those things are nothing but traps to get you entangled in present moments let me ask you this question you say brother Samuel the president's pretty real all right let me ask you this question do you think all your hurt and your offenses and all your complaints and everything you think that's going to be on the other side as soon as you step between Mortal and immortality you think you're going to be running down to say you never believe what so-and-so did to me you think you're going to be running for somebody Hey listen let me tell you what my boss did last week you ain't gonna care about your boss but you see listen friends I'm not saying situations aren't real we're saying don't let Faith come down here if you put your sights down here you're going to crash you're going to wreck you've got to set your sights up there and when you can't see in front of you there are Divine instruments that God has placed before us that we can fly through him by Divine instruments and when we can say I'm not real good at reading the instruments we can be guided by the radar of prayer and that's how Believers praying always without ceasing good preacher every day lunch box living faith is a long-range Vision it don't lower its sights it holds to the Target and use binoculars now brother Brian if you came in here with binoculars this morning and were looking at me I'd Wonder or him or Brother Richard I would really wonder why do you have binoculars on and looking up here at me right it don't make sense the reason you would say that is is because binoculars are not used to see objects that are close binoculars are used to see things that are afar off it's like it's brown it's got fur on it oh it's a lab it's a dog but then when you see a it's a deer how many points that have you see you you can't maybe see that far off but what does the binoculars take things that are a far off and brings it close to you so you start making decisions now by the things you're seeing before off and that's what the binoculars of Old Testament and New Testament as it's lined up together it lets us see there is no certainty in this world but what I see is a Rapture what I see is every promise of God what I see is every devil under my feet what I see is every devil conquered I see that through the victory of the anointing of the Holy Spirit coming upon the word brother Samuel I don't see it right now we don't see all things but I'm looking for out and say already conquered and what do you do walk towards what you're seeing and eventually my hope my faith will become sight eventually the binoculars at the change of the body get put down glory and be the god in the highest hallelujah oh my don't let the devil get their binoculars out of your hands it's like when Zach and I are in the booth you know I Gotta Wear I have to wear the glaring booth and uh blind I have to wear glasses and I don't know maybe some of y'all can help me but I'll tell you what looking through a binoculars I hate getting my glasses all fogged up sometimes I have to take them out and you know rearrange them and like and everything else and Zach Zaxby's are the one he's the very dad he's got the binoculars on he's looking at it Dad dad here's something coming here say oh Dad it's not don't worry and he's always looking through the binocular but I say it like this listen every one of us you have an access to a set of binoculars and don't let the devil get them out of your hand because if you get them out of your hand you'll start making decisions about things that you see right here and let me tell you something there is nothing in this world that's worth living for right now the pleasures of sin are but for a season it's just for a moment the Bible said life is but a vapor it passes by so quickly so you're not living for this moment you live for that world that's to come that's why brother Banner will make a statement like this he says as soon he said if you get into a church and hear a life you know and God's not really you to come to a place where that life is so settled out they're going to start looking at another place well they let the women cut hair over there they let them do this they do that and brother Adam said that paralyzes your faith because you start looking at other things you see what it is when you can look from church to church and compare Church to church that's because you never met Jesus I can't just say it very plain because once you ever meet the Lord God you meet the Lord Jesus let me tell you something there ain't no question if this message is the truth or not it's no question if it's Jesus Christ or not it's been made real in your life and let me tell you something he is enthroned in your heart over every devil over every Demon's sin has lost its hold there ain't enough Devils out of Torment that can ever take it out of your life hour of this revelation how do you do well you know even here this morning and no matter where a life is at you know how you make decisions brother Graham said there's a spirit in you that made a choice and he said the reason that spirit in you made the choice is because there was another spirit standing by you called the spirit of God that said raise your hand now I tell you that's how we start our journey but that's how it is with every single moment of our journey where the Holy Spirit it'll speak to our life and say this is for you it's coming right down your alley how many ever have things where you're maybe praying about and looking at and all of a sudden the holy spirit will come right down in a service he'll sweep right by it may not even been the exact words that you had on your heart are praying about but when that is finished there has been a relieving of like an oppression a Gloom a darkness and a how am I going to get through this right here what has happened there the spirit of God has come with the influence from another realm and the spirit inside of you has agreed with it and as a Son of God you are led by the spirit of God it leads you out of the darkness who glory be to God in the house and the influences Upon Our Life to make decisions you see Moses endured by seeing him that is invisible that's why there's a there's another realm that's real right here that's why that's why the Rapture ain't a place far off that's why Jesus ain't far off he's right here not in a corporate body he's right here that's why brother Brown said I cannot believe there's a house way I Yonder I believe if that house that God was speaking of is right here present right now what's he talking about Matthew it's not way out there we're seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus the Holy Ghost has come to tie you back in to your representation what is it it has come to do away with the chasm there's one standing in the Gap there is one who filled the breach there is one who have made up the Hedge who is it it is none other than Christ himself that has put his hands upon your life and it ties you right back into the word thank you brother Branson right here pressing with us now he said that's a place where the Mortal beings when we cease from this Miller mortal realm we step into immortality Yonder into a place and I believe that's where Jesus is today the resurrected Lord Jesus not out yonder somewhere a million miles away but right here pressing with us now you might say brother Samuel what does that have to do with me right now he ain't going to come any closer than what he is right now then let me tell you he said I'll be with you even in you to the end of the age he ain't just with you when you're in church he surrounds your life to influence your life to guide your life to move upon your life brother Samuel I hadn't even received the Holy Ghost yet let him keep on influence in your life and give yourself to the holy spirit that you keep on bumping into but let you know it deals with your life it bumps into your life calls things out of your heart what is it you're bumping into that realm that's right here that's more real than all the negative and doubtful thoughts sure brother Branson and soul is the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ right here he said it just like that fourth dimension where all them rays and like even of this of this right here you're hearing me through that voice but I have no connection to the system it's all waves these things are tuned right in I have this thing tuned right in set to a certain channel it's set on that to pick it up I have to set that and I have to set this by this mic pack and then you know what it does what is coming through here gets processed it's a wireless signal from here to there you say how can that pick it up it's built to receive the signal you could hook up another wireless unit this one right here is a sure you might hook up an AKG or hook up another one it wouldn't matter it will not work because it's got to work with the same brand it's got to be kind after kind and you see only this kind can pick up this kind and that's why the Lord Jesus only those of his kind can pick up the word of God there's something that's why Jesus said he could talk to the Pharisees and say hey he said you cannot receive me you do not you are not delighting in the word may manifest as your father Abraham did because ye Rejoice to see my day and he was glad but you have not the word abiding in you good Great China and he said what you are influenced from another Realm because that's the kind that's being influenced by kind right I'll say let me tell you something this morning what a privilege it is to be able to be influenced by the spirit of God and like when real influence comes it never leaves us where it finds us but Lord I want to move with that influence no matter if it's repentance water baptism Lord clean my life up fill me with the Holy Ghost Lord make me more like you I want to move under the influence of that other Realm I don't want to live under that that realm of influence that says you're all right here but you're good uh you know everything's all right not because that ending God coming to encourage me to settle down this is not the hour of settling down this is the hour to eat the Passover with the staff in your hands shoes on your feet loins girded and it's ready to go at a moment's notice brother Brown said here is the Lord Jesus standing in this room right here but the reason you can't see it is because your heart hasn't become tuned down to it you know I've looked at that quote many times and been thinking about how brother Brown will talk about how he'll go on to say you said like television picture she explains it being tuned down he said now television pictures our bodies are not set as instruments to pick it up but when our body becomes in tune with God becomes a part of him then our soul can pick up the power of the Holy Ghost to vindicate the presence of the Lord Jesus in all his power and omnipotence powerful tune down how do you become tuned down humbling ourselves to his voice the world is going so fast so fast so fast so fast everything was and what the spirit of God comes to speak to our lives to do what tune us down bring us back in tune I there's all sorts of frequencies trying to get at us wanting us to be in tune here and in tune there and in tune there and we go through and we feel all of those different pressures let me let me move on here just just real quickly to get get into this place here you realize that the Bible says it said he endured Moses endured now anybody knows when you say to endure something what does that mean gonna be some hardships right there's going to be some things or some real obstacles Moses endured as seeing him that is invisible now his Faith's been anointed but there's going to be some opposition some things that's going to come that's going to challenge that Faith but you know what it does it only shows that Faith that's already there it shows that it's something that cannot be overthrown that's why brother Brandon would make a statement he would say when a man ever catches a vision of the invisible God it stabilizes that man it'll stabilize him to know he's always prescient looking at the Unseen it stabilizes his actions in the time of distress and trouble it'll make him look upward and above the things that are happening around him because he's looking at the Unseen yet by promise would you turn in your Bibles with me I don't have this wrote down but I want you to go in your Bibles real quick now just just skip it I think we are aware the Lord just pressing these things on my heart once you go to Exodus 5 and I want you to look at verse 22 and 23 with me now here's Moses after he's come from out of the burning bush or come out and he's went back into Egypt with a message and here he is standing here veiling the pillar of Fire God has told him you're going to be a god in other words you'll be speaking with an authority that comes from another Realm they're going to look at your life and all they'll see is a mortal man Pharaoh is going to see a man who's got older but remember what he was like in his high school days he's only going to see you as a mortal but you have met the god of your fathers and there you are veiling the invisible God remember Moses right there in the presence of God at the burning bush remember hearing all his human weaknesses they are exposed in the presence of God God's not even having to call them out God's not even saying hey you can't talk real good and in that Moses everything he puts before God at that moment of why he's not going to be able to do it but you know what's happening if we could see it Moses is actually emptying up and that's all God wanted him to do he got him in the prince of God got him to a place to where he could just empty up I I just believe with all my heart God help me help us that we can turn aside when we come into services like this we come in throughout the Let It Be moments we can turn aside to where if there's been some conglomerations of the world and I'm talking about thoughts on our minds and everything else you know the the the the pressures but we can turn aside and our vision can be renewed I believe that's a place that we're at I want you to watch here here he goes down into Egypt in these two verses and Moses returned unto the Lord now this is after they stood before pharaoh and Moses has declared everything through Aaron remember what Pharaoh said to him he said hey you guys got too much time on your hands we're going to fill up your time you see who's trying to fill your time up it isn't God it's the enemy right and so to understand with that right there say God give me the wisdom that I'm not doing wtas now those you're not teachers you don't know wtas are near the end of the school year they're called waste of time activities seriously but you're trying to make things so productive like you're you know grades and everything else and I should have had young people close their ears first but uh I think it's a little different in middle school and high school I know that but you know as you get at any at any rate there's there's things that Pharaoh wants to Soul bombard and I'm telling you the spirits of this age wants to bombard Our Lives listen even with this Moses came down here Moses has been told by God everything that's going to happen and then here Pharaoh says you got too much time on your hands so we're going to try to take up some of your time you know why if we can get your mind off of victory and off of the promises of God you'll lose sight of it and the very thing when more came towards him what did they do they turned on Moses what in the world you come down here and you're a trumpet stir up all this disturbance against us right look what look what Moses said verse 22 and Moses returned unto the Lord and said Lord wherefore hast thou so evil entreated this people wow why is it that thou Hast sent me for since I came to pharaoh to speak in thy name he hath done evil to this people neither has thou delivered thy people at all but here's what I want you to notice he didn't take off running to the desert he had met God and even though God told him I'm going to harden Pharaoh's heart God already told him all this right but now Moses is in a place he doesn't know what's taking place see friends it shows you and I that even when we can receive a clear word from the Lord sometimes our thoughts about how things are going to be are not how God has in mind at all and that's what's going on with Moses right now Lord how about you send me down here I thought we I thought we was gonna I thought there was going to be delivered it's going to happen where he's going to say let's take up their time but he goes to the right source and if you'll notice the very next verse Exodus 6. then the Lord said unto Moses now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh for with a strong hand shall he let them go and with a strong hand shall he drive him out of this land and God spake unto Moses and sent unto him I am the Lord and I appeared unto Abraham unto Isaac watch this and unto Jacob by the name of God Almighty but by my name Jehovah was I not known to them what does Jehovah mean one who is existing right here with his family Moses you feel all alone but I'm right here with you I didn't save you I didn't give you an experience and then turn you on autopilot I'm right here governing in the Affairs of men I'm right here with you I'm your comforter Moses when a problem comes you don't understand run to me Moses talk to me Moses when things don't make sense talk to me but you'll read right here these two verses of scripture that we read you'll never find in anywhere else where Moses ever went to God like that again you know why he needed that moment to stabilize him brother Aaron it don't mean the pressure didn't come because here came one miracle Pharaoh's heart was heartened another one hardened another one hardened the more listen to me I'm closing the more Moses yielded to the voice of God in obedience the Lord spake unto Moses say this the Lord spake unto Moses do this the Lord what was he doing he was saying what the spirit was saying to say can we preach this for a minute that's why it's important he's the high priest of your profession that's why it's important when the word is coming and it speaks to your heart say what the spirit is saying say exactly no matter what you feel say exactly what it says the more Moses yielded in obedience the more it hardened pharaoh you wonder why things sometimes rise up against you rise up against us or things sometimes blind said you wonder why sometimes that is because there's a vessel of Mercy you yield more to the mercy of God and it only hardens others it hardens but it brings me to this statement right here and I'm going to read this here and I know I've said I'm closing I am on this brother REM says this two different times but yes last Sunday morning early when I was praying and the Lord dropped us in for this week here and this quote you're familiar with how many of you heard the state where brother Brian says when he talks about Moses he said I'm so glad that a man can live so close to God until the devil don't know what to do with it remember that brother Brown says in by faith Moses and also why Christ speak but he says it like this he said God plagued pharaoh with the voice of Moses I'm telling you you have been anointed to speak Samson was anointed to speak Joshua was anointed to speak Abigail when she did everything that was right and her husband her first husband was still living she went and put herself down in Repentance before David and then when David said Mercy has been found she went back to her first husband and said you're as good as a dead man what did she do she spoke the word and nabel's heart dropped within him you've been anointed to speak the word of God Anointed with the voice of God in your life to plague pharaoh well brother Samuel I don't feel I know there's some real super sometimes super spiritual feeling moments where we can speak some things and there's some other times where you don't feel so super spiritually anointed but you're speaking it because it is the word of God let the redeemed of the Lord say so say what the word has said about me and devil if you want to stick around go ahead and stick around and maybe I'm going to have this praise break in front of you I am going to rejoice in the table that is prepared for me in the presence of my enemies oh brother random say when you get to rejoicing in the presence of your enemies your cut begins to run over I am going to invite the presence of almighty God hallelujah hallelujah let's stand let me finish this fleas lies frog smoke he done everything till finally favor had to say get out is that the kind of testimony you want the devil to have about you we don't want the devil to have the testimony oh you don't want to worry about them they won't bother you wow they're all right just got to hit him with a little thought here and there and he'll be all right the rest they'll just they'll comb right down they'll settle right down no we need to press through that Darkness press through it with life what do you keep doing keep pecking at it keep chopping at it keep chopping at it keep chopping at it keep chopping at it keep chopping at it I'm talking about everyday living and I'm so glad that a man can so completely serve God till the devil don't know what to do with him completely it just means what he says I say My Confession that's what his confession is what is that that's a man that the devil don't know what to do with when you rely upon what the Holy Spirit has spoke to your heart and made you you rely upon the word the word comes and it corrects your life and you say Lord forgive me Lord I'm ready to rise up what is it it's one who is surrendering into the hands of God and the devil said I thought I could keep him trapped in that I thought I could keep them bound with that right there but realizing you're Rising under the influence of another Realm he just obeyed God so completely till the devil said get away I don't want to hear it no more brother Branham said you can do it so completely how many of you know words create an atmosphere the words we speak create an atmosphere oh my let us say what the spirit is saying when the spirit says repent I want to repent when the spirit brings it says speaks of cleansing we want cleansing when the spirit speaks of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's what to move into when the holy spirit says hey there's more for you there's more for me Lord God I want to go deeper to such a place to will Pharaoh the world finally says get out of here get out of here oh God help us let's pray father Lord I'm sure that every one of us no matter Lord where we would be at Lord right here this morning but God to be able to identify him with your word to be able or to have that objective that desire Lord and that within our lives to live so completely in your hands the Lord father in every one of these stages that we looked at like in Moses life there was Faith all along and Lord I didn't realize that sitting right here this morning and I'm certain Lord here and maybe streaming lives it's never maybe crossed all the way into that promise of the Holy Ghost where their faith has been anointed but father right here that faith that already would lay within them is being cultivated to a place to believe you for all things to realize that there's there's nothing no matter what kind of scarecrow or what the devil would want to ever try to put before him to try to hinder them but Lord God may they Lord rise with the authority in that word and to look to look Beyond present circumstances not to allow the world to take their eyes their attention their focus Lord I realize that every one of us we live in this world but we're not of it Paul would write of it that we would use this world without abusing it I pray that God that you would help every one of us maybe Lord and lives is like Moses he didn't go running back out into the desert there's times Lord were things that's been in our life that Lord God wants meeting you in that way that it stabilized us to know that you're always with us Moses didn't have to run back to the burning bush but the God that he met through that attraction was now dwelling with him and in him and all he had to do was go talk to you father it was a stabilizing in that moment and from then on when opposition arose Moses met that opposition by the standard of the word that was revealed call for fleas call for flies call for frogs he didn't even think how are fleas going to come how are flies going to come how are frogs going to come how he didn't he just he spoke it Lord now father it was you that stabilized him it's you that stabilizes your children [Music] and Lord I pray right here this morning may that be the confession from our lives Lord May our lives or be under that confession that yielded to you Lord we want to be so completely yielded to you to where the devil doesn't know what to do with us oh there's traps that's sure there's always a contest that's on always a battle that's going on the battle itself Lord does does not mean does not mean that Lord we're not yielded but the battle itself is to try to pull us out from under the influence of that Realm but may we lord God I pray this morning if there's one thing that Lord God is lives and hearts can be gathered here this morning to realize we'll never ever live Victorious with all the opposition that is in this realm if we walk and live by the visible but the way that we overcome is by faith it's the Lord God as Moses would look to you and surrender himself then his life became a channel and victory moved through each situation what I'd love to be able to stand here in in one way I'm sure all of us would to say we've never made mistakes we've never been out of the influence of that realm or but Lord there's times that we have Lord God where we've asked you to forgive us and maybe right here this morning hearts Lord that would just in this tenderness and sweetness of your presence or maybe all those wrongs have been made right but maybe it's an opportunity right here to say Lord I want to just come back under that influence Lord [Music] I want that the influence of that other Realm of the Holy Ghost to guide and direct me Lord [Music] every decision Lord help me help me to weigh everything in the balance of the word not to look at it not to even entertain my feelings but let me weigh it with the word of God granted Lord right here this morning we Face the Lord our jobs face everything that's around us family life Lord home life Lord jobs every situation Lord marriage on and on and on oh God we look to the Unseen this morning Lord this is where Lord we receive our strength this is what stabilizes us like it did Elisha when by the word of God he had already met you and though Elisha did not see them angels but he had a confidence he knew the god that it had been placed in the word that the angels of God are encamped around about them that fear Him and love him but he could pray he knew they were there he had a confidence in the word Lord that's what your Prophet told us Lord and look into the Unseen he had a confidence in the word that he could pray and you would loosen gehaza's eyes to where gehaza could see him now Lord I'm sure standing right here this morning maybe there's a situation there's a need May eyes be loosed to see the invisible God who's present mindful of our need mindful of the condition in our life mindful of situations oh granted Lord and yield yield to the word of God granted Lord You're our stabilizer you're our stabilizer Lord You're our strength Lord God our flesh the weakness of our flesh but there is such a stability that comes Lord in our lives because of you not because of us but because of you may we stand like Moses Lord May our voice be a plague to this world may it Lord him that it's a plague to the world may it be Lord is Mercy coming through to others Lord God sons and daughters that are still caught in this conglomeration of sin and darkness may it be a voice that proclaims Jubilee Liberty overcoming granted Lord through our lives through our actions through our speech Lord granted father we pray in Jesus name [Music] amen influenced by another Realm that's the realm I want to live by that realm been birthed by that Spirit that's where realm I want to live by on and on example is on and on Parts in the word but everyday life every day every day life we want to be influenced by that other Realm Hallelujah aren't you glad you know I'm glad God never gave up on me I'm glad God don't give up on none of his children God never gave up on Moses because Moses was a part of him and I just said you know as I've just looking and studying and moving through a lot of these things one thing that just so so oppressed upon my heart is one of the biggest lies sometimes that Satan wants to try to tell our young people middle age and I find it a lot among young people as though you don't have nothing until you get the Holy Ghost that ain't true Moses had these great qualities in him they had to be anointed by God the majority of our texts that we read out of Hebrews 11 was about a man before the holy ghost ever came he chose not to be a son of pharaoh why he was under the influence of another Realm and that's why I say that no matter where you're at in your journey let your life every one of us be influenced by the Holy Ghost what is it making a step closer until finally you stand there United with almighty God and then you know what you keep on uniting you keep on uniting you grow deeper and you grow deeper and you grow deeper you go stronger more and more and more and more and more like him because your new birth you're not born a mature son and daughter of God we're birthed and then we grow we develop we grow we develop we have stumblings but we grow and we develop and there's something that pulsates within us Amen to the word of God so be it Lord we have a witness in our life that there's something changed me I didn't change myself I wanted to change I I knew I needed him but I didn't change myself he changed me what is it that's the real sacred sins of God's grace don't you love him oh my I want to be so completely yielded go ahead brother Brian lead us in a song go ahead [Music] yes Lord [Music] Lord Lord is what set your me to the wind you can do not struggle it's my grace [Music] there are two [Music] Lords one by side more money take the word of God or what you [Applause] what you want foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] it will it will move through for you [Music] you set you away [Music] [Applause] [Music] in a Hospital [Music] second place what's your name what's your name what's your pride what's your Mountain that's much too oh [Music] you will fly set your wings to The Winds of faith [Music] the higher place

[Applause] [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] I'd like to see [Music] world to this world [Music] we have [Music] [Music] it is [Music] [Music] before so much [Music] [Applause] step of the way no matter where you're at in God remember it always takes faith he that cometh to God must first believe that he is Faith all along and God anoints that Faith then there's the invisible God behind that Faith motivating it and that's where we rely on like we looked at on Thursday night we don't rely on our reasonings we don't rely on our outside realm we've been in contact with another Realm and our faith is Anointed there's an anchor and that's where John could say whosoever is born of God overcometh the world and to overcome means to prevail conquer carry off the victory so there's opposition but opposition only proves what's in you and whosoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory even our faith faith is such a great thing faith is such a wonderful thing I'm so grateful I'm grateful for that influence from another Realm in this hour we live in the church world had it all sold sold up but God rent the Veil he rent The Veil that we now could come under the influence of that other Realm that he's the same yesterday today and forever we're not just coming to the rapture we are the rapture we're not just coming to a translation we're in the translation we've been translated from Death unto life and we keep on walking on with God where he leads me I'm gonna fall in every situation I'm going to let go of my own will in his presence Lord not mine will thine will be done it didn't mean that Moses didn't have troubles but Moses never questioned again why did you send me here but he stood right there and you know what God told him what to say sometimes you say Lord fill my mouth fill my mouth with what needs to be said here Lord sometimes I don't know what to say fill my mouth Lord and then do what speak for flies speak for fleas speak to that condition speak to that Gloom speak to that depression speak to that Temptation speak to that anxiety speak to other what are you doing you're speaking to everything that would rise up against the promise of God what are you doing you're yielding yourself to God you could I could we could all yield ourselves to our feelings because our feelings are real right but there's something more real than my feelings if I can just yield to that and say what he says say but the same I may not feel it yet I may not really fully believe it say it till you do believe it that's the words of the prophets say it till you do believe it and keep pecking at it keep punching at it oh my God what are you well you're a plague your voice is a plague to the devil because the devil trying to pour everything he can on you to try to get you discouraged and out here in this realm or in this realm you might feel you might feel down you have those feelings but on the inside there's something that's a bubbling and you just speak right out this is mine this is mine Gloom is not an atmosphere of a believer depression not mine anxiety not mine back trouble not mine hello somebody it's a voice coming against all of those things well I'll tell you we've been made more in conquerors if you just look into the mirror of what you are what God has made you look at it it'll build faith to pierce every Darkness you love him oh praise be to God praise be to God oh friends listen when we leave out of here and leave out of his presence we don't actually leave his presence we do it with one another but let's take this this is Victory this is Victory your feelings do not define you God's word has defined you of Who You Are live by what the word has made you you love him father thank you Lord for your word your presence has come to direct us Lord go with your children we would ask the Lord as we go our separate ways be with the sisters Lord in their meeting in the back what's over each and every
