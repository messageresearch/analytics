[32:11] whatever it might be God is
[32:14] faithful not only to lead you in that
[32:16] step but to lead you right there in that
[32:20] moment and he's right there with you you
[32:23] know when God brought Israel out of
[32:25] Egypt I don't don't think anybody
[32:27] thought about what are we going to eat
[32:31] how are we going to replace our clothes
[32:34] what about our
[32:36] shoes they didn't know that the journey
[32:40] itself was going to be over 40 years
[32:43] that's that wasn't God's choice but that
[32:46] was a decision they made but look even
[32:48] in those 40
[32:50] years they didn't even have to look back
[32:53] to the Red Sea although God said
[32:55] remember I brought you out of Egypt they
[32:58] could look at their garments their
[33:02] clothes they've not even worn
[33:04] out they could
[33:06] see the goodness of God the Mana that
[33:11] fell they didn't have to go look for
[33:13] water water came looking for
[33:16] them that that's that's all
[33:19] God not just speaking of Israel but God
[33:23] was relaying his thoughts about you and
[33:26] I
[33:27] it's like with Noah why would a man
[33:29] build an ark on dry land not in a
[33:34] shipyard because God didn't need to
[33:37] bring the ship to the water God would
[33:40] bring the water to the ship once again
[33:43] God expressing his thoughts to you and I
[33:47] it's the mercy of God I I'm grateful for
[33:50] that tonight when man fell in the
[33:52] beginning no way to get back to God God
[33:55] came and made a way back for you and
[33:58] I it's the grace of God and how thankful
[34:01] we are for his Mercy I'm grateful we
[34:03] don't have to look far but we can see
[34:06] him in our own
[34:07] life we see him we see this token
[34:10] working we see the living reality of
[34:12] Jesus Christ and that's worth everything
[34:15] that's precious amen don't you love him
[34:18] tonight amen it's so good to be together
[34:21] Amen in the presence of the Lord and
[34:23] it's good to have brother Timothy a
[34:24] Shong here with us tonight and we're not
[34:27] going to prolong we want to invite him
[34:29] to go ahead and make his way forward I
[34:31] want to remind you as I mentioned to you
[34:33] on Sunday about um the prayer request
[34:35] for brother joshu and sister Sharon um
[34:40] there when she has her
[34:41] interview uh coming up for um the
[34:45] admittance into the United States uh
[34:48] that's on the Wednesday before
[34:50] Thanksgiving which is November 22nd that
[34:53] we would be in prayer many of the things
[34:55] that we just was talking with brother
[34:56] way at the beginning of the week
[34:58] many of the things they know within that
[35:00] day and sometimes then there's papers
[35:03] that sent uh within a few days later so
[35:06] I told him I said you know what I said
[35:08] in the beginning first of all it's a
[35:10] miracle and second of all we're not
[35:12] going to stop praying until we see the
[35:15] feet on the
[35:16] soil amen so you know the the the Church
[35:21] of the Living God there in the book of
[35:22] Acts they were praying for
[35:24] Peter and the angel of the Lord let him
[35:26] complete out of the city then Peter
[35:28] comes and knocks on the door and I'm
[35:31] sure their response is many times like
[35:33] you and I they open the door and there's
[35:35] Peter Wham they slam the door Peter's
[35:38] ghost Peter's theophany he's he's on and
[35:42] an incredible we're praying and we have
[35:45] faith in what we're praying but when God
[35:46] answers it startles
[35:48] us I love I love how God included that
[35:51] in the book of Acts don't you God
[35:53] doesn't care about Humanity being seen
[35:57] because it's deity that we glorify it's
[36:00] Christ that we glorify amen so we want
[36:03] to remember that in prayer also brother
[36:04] Brian read that about sister Fay right
[36:06] now and um we just had had prayer with
[36:09] her over the phone just a few moments
[36:11] ago so just continue to keep her in
[36:14] prayer that's Sister carper's Sister
[36:16] some of you no doubt remember her from
[36:18] when she would come here also the
[36:20] meetings this weekend with Brother John
[36:22] Sanger it'll be the first time that
[36:24] brother John Sanger has been here
[36:26] perhaps for some of you it'll be the
[36:28] first time you've heard brother John
[36:29] Sanger and uh brother John just has a
[36:32] wonderful Ministry and uh very very
[36:37] visual so my boys are already looking
[36:39] and saying is he bringing a U-Haul truck
[36:41] with visual displays because brother
[36:42] John is just that kind of a minister but
[36:44] he's just has just such a wonderful gift
[36:47] and brother John has ministered in many
[36:50] different um youth functions as well as

[46:00] amorites dwell in the mountains and the

[46:15] Moses and said let us go up at once and
[46:20] possess it for we are well able to
[46:24] overcome it
[46:26] but the men that went up with him
[46:30] said we be not able to go up against the
[46:34] people for they are stronger than
[46:39] we and they brought up an evil reports
[46:43] of the land which they had search unto
[46:48] the children of Israel saying the land
[46:52] through which we have gone to search
[46:57] it is a land that heated up the
[47:01] inhabitants
[47:03] thereof and all the people that we saw
[47:07] in it were men of a great
[47:12] stature and there we saw the
[47:15] Giants the sons of
[47:18] anak which come of the
[47:20] Giants and we were in our own sight as
[47:24] grasshoppers
[47:26] and so we were in their

[47:33] his word shall we please be
[47:41] seated amen let's read 2
[47:48] Corinthians chapter

[48:09] sight in the book of the prophet Isaiah
[48:12] chapter
[48:14] 45 verse 22 the Lord
[48:18] said look unto me all ye ends of the
[48:24] Earth look unto me and be ye
[48:28] saved all the end of the Earth for I am
[48:33] God and there is none
[48:36] else
[48:38] amen hallelujah so we bless the name of
[48:41] the Lord again and uh I'm very grateful
[48:45] again to the almighty God for the
[48:46] opportunity given to me to be here and
[48:49] to Fellowship together with the Breen
[48:52] and I thank God so
[48:54] much that today by his grace I am
[48:57] standing on my
[48:59] feet last year I was here and I was very
[49:04] sick very very
[49:06] sick and I had to go through
[49:09] surgery and uh what they call it uh
[49:12] radical protonic prot Atomic uh uh
[49:16] surgery or whatever they call it and uh
[49:19] I have to deal with my
[49:21] prostate and
[49:24] uh yeah it was very very
[49:28] difficult somewhere last year or the
[49:31] year before
[49:32] yeah and I I I I was having problem I
[49:36] was not able to pee or want to go to the
[49:39] restroom and and there was nothing the
[49:42] urine not coming oh my it was very very
[49:45] difficult and uh I was just having pains
[49:49] and pains and pains and all sleepless
[49:52] nights and Sleepless days
[49:56] infections all kind of trouble so
[50:01] finally the Lord made a way for me to
[50:04] come travel back I mean travel to the US
[50:06] and uh that was in July last year July
[50:11] and I stayed for about 9 months in the
[50:14] US and I have to be seeing doctors here
[50:17] and there and finally they decided to
[50:20] do
[50:23] surgery because they said my Pro R has
[50:26] become so big and I was not able broken
[50:29] the chance or the way to urine so they
[50:32] have to do
[50:34] that and uh after that has been
[50:41] done complications came
[50:45] in and at a point I was not even able to
[50:53] walk I have to be using the
[50:58] we what they call it the Walker to be
[51:01] walking if I sit down I could not get up
[51:05] if I lie down I could not get up they
[51:07] have to pull me my wife has to pull me
[51:10] or my nephew has to PVE me or even to
[51:13] sit in the car I man to back able to sit
[51:18] down and then they have to I could not
[51:20] lift my leg like this they have to raise
[51:23] it and put it in and raise this and put
[51:26] it
[51:28] in ah it was it was just
[51:31] difficult but thank God for his
[51:34] grace that today I am standing on my
[51:38] feet by his
[51:43] grace I Knew You prayed for
[51:45] me and I thank you for your
[51:48] prayers that if you see me standing here
[51:51] is because you
[51:54] prayed and God answered your
[51:57] prayer he said
[52:00] God and is so good it's our savior is a
[52:04] God that answers
[52:06] prayer I work cath for nine
[52:09] months nine good
[52:12] months I could not PE on my own for 9
[52:15] months I was wearing the
[52:24] catheter and uh when they took it
[52:27] out I have to be wearing
[52:33] Pampers I'm saying that because God has
[52:36] done it to give glory to Jehovah
[52:40] God and for you to know that whatever
[52:42] your condition might be God is
[52:47] Mindful and
[52:49] it's he's still in the business of
[52:52] healing right
[52:54] amen and and is still working and is
[52:56] still
[53:00] alive so whatever your challenge might
[53:05] be look to the promise of
[53:09] God don't look at the
[53:13] circumstances or the
[53:17] obstacles look at the promises of God I
[53:21] remember when I went to the doctor in
[53:23] Ghana and the check the doctor I said oh
[53:26] there is cancer and is and I said no you
[53:29] don't have to worry just a little it's a
[53:30] little spot there it's not spread I said
[53:33] but I was not worried anyway because
[53:36] when he said that the only thing that
[53:37] came to me do you fear
[53:40] cancer because I know the prophet
[53:42] preached
[53:43] that and he told us there is no fear
[53:47] there is no virtue in
[53:51] fear so you don't have to fear no matter
[53:53] what they said to you even if you are
[53:55] going to die the next day there is no
[53:57] need to fear it's just to
[54:00] believe he a faith we sign the pardon
[54:03] for
[54:04] you Hallelujah and even when I was
[54:07] living Ghana because we told what should
[54:10] we do I said no I told my wife let me
[54:13] stay in GH I said no no you have to go
[54:16] and some but B coffee got to hear about
[54:18] it and then he has to call that look
[54:20] brother if you can travel out just
[54:22] travel leave and come we have the best
[54:24] doctors and we see whatever can be
[54:27] done and the doctor when I was leaving
[54:29] GH I told me you know people go to
[54:31] America overseas they do surgery and
[54:33] they come back and the rest of their
[54:35] lives they will be wearing Pampers here
[54:37] and
[54:39] there but I thank
[54:41] God God is good he took care of
[54:46] me and today by his grace I don't wear
[54:49] Pampers
[54:53] yes and I'm saying this because I said
[54:56] to God if you hear me if you work I will
[55:00] wherever I go I will
[55:03] testify I said I testify to the glory of
[55:06] God and to The Shame of the
[55:12] devil so when God does something for us
[55:16] he doesn't want us to keep it he want us
[55:18] to
[55:21] testify you have to testify sometime
[55:25] people get afraid of testifying because
[55:28] Devil comes and when you testify you'll
[55:29] be sick again this and and I said to
[55:32] Satan if I get sick again he will heal
[55:35] me
[55:36] again I don't have problem with that yes
[55:42] sir when I was going through the trials
[55:45] and I said brother BR I'm said until God
[55:47] has finished with you nothing can take
[55:49] you out of this life that's just what I
[55:52] believe if I drop that today because
[55:55] because God has finished with me but
[55:56] until then
[55:59] nothing so we should not be tormented by
[56:02] the fear of death because he has not
[56:05] given us the spirit to fear he has given
[56:09] the spirit of sons and daughters that we
[56:12] can cry AB
[56:15] father and I was saying to Brother Sam
[56:18] said God is so good and it's always it's
[56:22] always on time
[56:25] amen I was booked to go to the hospital
[56:29] to do
[56:30] cystogram when after the surgery and uh
[56:35] I went first after the surgery last year
[56:38] by this time I was very very sick J they
[56:41] did the surgery on the 14th of November
[56:46] so today it's I think
[56:48] 16th so last year by this time oh it was
[56:51] very
[56:53] difficult so I give God the praise and I
[56:57] give God the honor and I give God the
[57:02] Adoration and so when I went to do the
[57:06] cystogram and then they said oh no it's
[57:09] not where they Stitch they have to open
[57:12] here there there five spots
[57:17] yeah and then it's okay you have to come
[57:20] back in 10 days 10 days in 10 days come
[57:24] back and then we went myself and my
[57:27] wife and at this
[57:30] time my sister and my nephew that we
[57:33] were staying with in the house they've
[57:36] left us to Africa so just the two of us
[57:40] were at
[57:41] home and it happened we went to the
[57:43] hospital in the that morning very fine
[57:46] went there but then when I was put on
[57:49] the table I went on lie on the table for
[57:51] the cystogram the whatever SC was to be
[57:54] taken and all of a sudden I was
[57:58] shaking shaking the whole table was
[58:01] moving vibrating so what is happening I
[58:03] said I don't
[58:04] know I didn't know what happened from
[58:07] there
[58:09] again I only saw myself in the emergency
[58:14] room so my wife said they called they
[58:17] came and called said who brought Timothy
[58:19] as
[58:20] sh so said do the I was lying and then
[58:24] they came they tried to fix things on me
[58:26] and then at that time he said all my
[58:29] system begin to shut down everything was
[58:32] going down and the doctors were looking
[58:35] at her she was looking at them but she
[58:37] was just praying and somehow by the
[58:41] grace of God he begin to pick up again
[58:44] God they give dreams and things but
[58:46] nothing but at a point he begin to pick
[58:49] up again so we give glory to God and
[58:53] then
[58:55] God is so good I said if
[58:58] this situation that I fell in or went in
[59:02] if it had happened while we were at
[59:05] home it would have been very
[59:08] difficult because we were strangers in
[59:11] the place nobody was with us the closest
[59:15] brother that was with us was 45 minutes
[59:21] away and my wife would not have know
[59:23] even how to call 911 because we are just
[59:28] strangers and the condition would have
[59:30] put her in a very bad shape but God is
[59:34] always right he always ahead of the
[59:36] enemy that he made it to happen right
[59:40] before the
[59:41] doctors and so right there they move
[59:44] into the emergency
[59:46] room so you can't beat
[59:50] God he's so mindful of us
[59:58] praise the name of the Lord and there
[1:00:00] was scripture that comes to me and said
[1:00:03] this also shall
[1:00:05] pass this also shall
[1:00:08] pass and I remember the scripture that
[1:00:11] says and it came to pass and I will say
[1:00:14] to myself this also shall
[1:00:17] pass and thank God it came to pass
[1:00:23] amen God is
[1:00:26] mindful I stayed in the emergency for 6
[1:00:30] days when they did the surgery the next
[1:00:33] day I was discharged but this time I
[1:00:36] have to stay there for 6
[1:00:43] days God is so
[1:00:45] good that he saw me through because he
[1:00:49] saw that I will be here this
[1:00:52] evening so he SP my life to be here this
[1:00:56] evening to give this testimony to you
[1:01:00] that no matter your
[1:01:03] situation keep your eyes on the
[1:01:07] promise because Jesus Christ is the same
[1:01:10] yesterday today and
[1:01:13] forever just to encourage ourselves this
[1:01:16] evening let's speak on keep your eyes on
[1:01:19] the
[1:01:22] promise not the
[1:01:29] obstacles
[1:01:32] Hallelujah he
[1:01:35] said now what made Caleb so sure of it
[1:01:40] when the opposition was so
[1:01:43] great it is according to what you are
[1:01:47] looking
[1:01:48] at Caleb was looking at the promise of
[1:01:52] God the other
[1:01:55] was looking at the
[1:01:58] circumstance if you go to look at the
[1:02:02] circumstances or to
[1:02:05] look at what is around you you are sure
[1:02:09] to
[1:02:12] fail but you must never look at what is
[1:02:16] around
[1:02:18] you don't look at the circumstances or
[1:02:21] what is around
[1:02:23] you
[1:02:25] the Lord Jehovah said in the book of
[1:02:27] Isaiah look unto
[1:02:30] me or ye an of the earth and you shall
[1:02:34] be
[1:02:36] saved so in this hour that we are living
[1:02:42] in God is calling his
[1:02:46] children he believing people that we
[1:02:49] should look at him in
[1:02:53] this
[1:02:55] hour in this period when men's hearts
[1:02:59] are failing for
[1:03:01] fear
[1:03:03] when the leaders of this word heads of
[1:03:08] states and president are confused
[1:03:10] because nobody know what will be the
[1:03:13] next hour look at what is happening in
[1:03:16] Palestine Israel
[1:03:18] today nobody knows how it is going to
[1:03:21] end and Israel is God time
[1:03:26] peace whatever happens to Israel watch
[1:03:34] out praise the Lord and I try to find
[1:03:37] and look Brothers what brought Israel
[1:03:40] into this
[1:03:41] condition is because at that point they
[1:03:44] were
[1:03:46] divided the nation was
[1:03:49] divided because the whole world knows
[1:03:52] the security of Israel
[1:03:55] there is no nation that is security
[1:03:58] minded like
[1:03:59] Israel and everybody believe their
[1:04:04] agents what they can
[1:04:06] do but they were
[1:04:11] divided they were almost about to fight
[1:04:14] one another they were
[1:04:17] determined to
[1:04:19] fight because somebody is thinking oh
[1:04:23] this one is doing this because of this
[1:04:25] this one is doing because of that and
[1:04:28] sometimes our thinking our thoughts is
[1:04:33] wrong because sometime we think about
[1:04:36] ourselves oh this did that that did that
[1:04:39] he did this because of this he didn't
[1:04:41] greet me he didn't call me he didn't do
[1:04:43] this and that sometime that is just your
[1:04:46] thought
[1:04:49] right and when you conceive a wrong
[1:04:52] thought you will deliver a wrong
[1:04:56] life because whatever you conceive you
[1:04:59] give birth to
[1:05:00] it so the prophet say you just imagine
[1:05:03] that somebody hat you or somebody
[1:05:06] doesn't like you once you imagine that
[1:05:08] way you will see everything that
[1:05:11] way and then you will put meaning to
[1:05:16] things that is not
[1:05:18] so because whatever you conceive is
[1:05:21] whatever you give birth to
[1:05:24] so then if God speaks to a heart of a
[1:05:28] man there will never be bitterness in
[1:05:30] your
[1:05:31] heart there will never be hatred when
[1:05:34] God is on the scene when God is dealing
[1:05:37] with a man he feels your heart with
[1:05:43] love it takes away
[1:05:46] suspicions it takes away bitterness and
[1:05:53] Malice
[1:05:54] may the Lord help
[1:05:56] [Music]
[1:05:58] us let me read this quote
[1:06:00] here the prophet say I've never talked
[1:06:03] like this to a group of
[1:06:05] people but in this locality here and
[1:06:09] throughout the Nations is becoming now
[1:06:12] if the devil can keep us
[1:06:14] separated he's got us he's got us
[1:06:17] shooting at one
[1:06:19] another he's got a an open Target
[1:06:23] anywhere he wants to
[1:06:25] shoot and what is the use of shooting we
[1:06:29] are shooting one another
[1:06:32] see so he can just sit back and
[1:06:38] relax when we begin to shoot at one
[1:06:41] another he sits back and he relax yeah
[1:06:44] just do it for
[1:06:47] me the prophet
[1:06:49] said let me just give you if I have
[1:06:53] found
[1:06:54] Grace in your sight through God you take
[1:06:58] my word for this Brethren if you want to
[1:07:02] be a blessing and get a blessing when a
[1:07:07] man has done you wrong and he has
[1:07:11] absolutely justly I mean he's done you
[1:07:14] wrong and you know that he's done you
[1:07:18] wrong is done you evil don't mention
[1:07:22] that
[1:07:27] you take
[1:07:29] him to prayer before God and don't take
[1:07:33] it in a way of just a selfish and say
[1:07:40] well I'm supposed to do this but but
[1:07:45] stand with your shoulder to his
[1:07:49] shoulder and stand in the presence of
[1:07:52] God our Father
[1:07:56] a way a prayer should be made in the
[1:07:59] presence of God say father here is my
[1:08:02] brother and is justly he deserves
[1:08:05] punishment because he has done me
[1:08:10] evil I don't see why he did
[1:08:14] it then listen to this then let God go
[1:08:19] to talking to you when you have been
[1:08:22] offended when somebody has done you
[1:08:25] wrong and you go to God
[1:08:29] praying he said let God go to talking to
[1:08:32] you not to the one that has offended you
[1:08:35] but let God go to talking to
[1:08:38] you if it is your wife if it is your
[1:08:41] husband if it is your church member
[1:08:43] whoever it be or the pastor or the
[1:08:46] church member or a deacon or whatever
[1:08:48] let God go talking to
[1:08:52] you because some time we pray Lord let
[1:08:55] him see that he has done me
[1:08:59] wrong let him know that he's
[1:09:02] wrong let God go to talking to
[1:09:13] you and you will see maybe what that
[1:09:17] mans has been
[1:09:21] through the devil has Twisted up
[1:09:24] somewhere and cause him to do
[1:09:28] that you will see what that man what
[1:09:32] that woman what that brother has gone
[1:09:36] through the devil might have twist him
[1:09:38] in some way to cause him to react or
[1:09:43] behave that way towards
[1:09:46] you you will see maybe he has not seen
[1:09:50] it what but you will see after you have
[1:09:53] gone to
[1:09:55] prayer are we
[1:09:58] together are we together don't be afraid
[1:10:01] to say Amen to the word of
[1:10:05] God what about somebody ask a question
[1:10:07] you are not
[1:10:09] speaking huh are we together all
[1:10:14] right the prophet
[1:10:16] said though he is absolutely
[1:10:20] wrong though he is absolutely wrong
[1:10:24] before you leave the Throne of God you
[1:10:27] will be feeling sorry for that
[1:10:34] man you'll be feeling sorry for the one
[1:10:38] that has offended
[1:10:39] you you'll be feeling sorry for the one
[1:10:43] that has done you
[1:10:45] wrong when God talk to your
[1:10:52] heart
[1:10:54] you
[1:10:55] will be
[1:10:57] sympathizing with that
[1:11:02] brother and when you get back down to
[1:11:05] where to Earth again you will go over to
[1:11:08] that brother and shake his
[1:11:14] hands did you hear
[1:11:17] that you'll be feeling sorry for the man
[1:11:22] you'll be sympath
[1:11:24] with the
[1:11:25] man and you will go and Shakeen with the
[1:11:30] one that has wronged
[1:11:34] you this is difficult but that's the
[1:11:37] word of the
[1:11:42] lord we believe the Prophet this is the
[1:11:45] prophet speaking to
[1:11:47] us this is God's
[1:11:50] Prophet instructing us and remember he
[1:11:54] told us complete obedience to the word
[1:11:58] of God what would that do to us we give
[1:12:02] you the
[1:12:06] token and Jesus told us if we greet
[1:12:10] those who greet us alone if we do good
[1:12:12] to those who just do good to us alone if
[1:12:15] we love those who just love us alone
[1:12:17] what extraordinary things are we doing
[1:12:20] the Christian the believer goes the
[1:12:31] my you'll be sympathizing with that
[1:12:33] brother and when you are you are back on
[1:12:36] Earth again you will go over to that
[1:12:39] brother and shake his hand cuz you know
[1:12:42] what he has been
[1:12:44] through you can't stand with a MTAR in
[1:12:48] the presence of God and condemn anybody
[1:12:52] I don't believe NOS sir even if he is a
[1:12:56] rank
[1:12:58] Sinner and what about a brother that has
[1:13:01] made a
[1:13:04] mistake though I say he is
[1:13:07] wrong sometimes he is accus wrong when
[1:13:11] he is not
[1:13:19] wrong but if he is
[1:13:22] wrong
[1:13:24] well if we will take him to the throne
[1:13:28] of God stand there shoulder to shoulder
[1:13:32] with our brother knowing he is a mortal
[1:13:38] and maybe his destination rest upon our
[1:13:43] attitude towards
[1:13:48] him when we come back from the Throne of
[1:13:52] God
[1:13:53] you will realize that we are everyone
[1:13:57] guilty and we all need help from one
[1:14:03] another and the best way to do is
[1:14:08] pray amen may God help us not to be
[1:14:14] forgetful hearers of God's word or not
[1:14:17] just to sympathize with God's word but
[1:14:20] that we will be hearers and doers that
[1:14:23] God will give us Grace to obey his
[1:14:27] word and I've said Jesus said we should
[1:14:30] love our enemies and we should love our
[1:14:33] neighbors and love one another and I
[1:14:36] have said if you cannot love your
[1:14:40] brother your husband your wife oh
[1:14:44] whatever say as your wife as your
[1:14:46] brother as your sister then love him or
[1:14:50] her as your
[1:14:52] neighbor
[1:14:54] because he said love your neighbor as
[1:14:57] yourself if you cannot love him as your
[1:15:00] neighbor then love it as your enemy
[1:15:02] because he said love your
[1:15:08] enemies is it funny that's the word of
[1:15:11] God love your enemies so even if your
[1:15:15] wife becomes an enemy love her as an
[1:15:17] enemy we are not asked to hate our
[1:15:19] enemies we are asked to love our enemies
[1:15:30] praise the
[1:15:31] Lord Brother Brown told us love is the
[1:15:35] strongest
[1:15:36] force he said when it is put to test it
[1:15:39] will defeat the strongest
[1:15:44] enemy this is the word of the Lord to us
[1:15:47] remember God sends a prophet and the
[1:15:50] prophet brings the mind of God Amen
[1:15:55] the message that we have received today
[1:15:58] is to bring Christ in our lives amen
[1:16:03] that they can say and look at us and say
[1:16:05] that this man this woman this boy has
[1:16:11] been with Christ amen because when you
[1:16:14] stay with Christ your life will change
[1:16:18] amen praise the name of the Lord may God
[1:16:21] help us the hour is
[1:16:24] late look at the state Israel is in
[1:16:28] today
[1:16:30] since they became a nation 75 years ago
[1:16:34] nothing like this has ever happened to
[1:16:35] them for over thousand people to be
[1:16:38] killed on their own soil even in their
[1:16:42] Wars when they fought battles fought
[1:16:45] against Nations 13 Nations five nations
[1:16:49] nothing like this ever happened to
[1:16:52] them
[1:16:54] nothing like
[1:16:56] that in a day over a thousand people
[1:17:00] killed and those that were kidnapped and
[1:17:02] those that were raped and come
[1:17:08] on all because they were
[1:17:13] fighting they were
[1:17:15] divided and in their unguided
[1:17:19] moment the enemy came
[1:17:21] in so the enemy is always looking for a
[1:17:25] time to
[1:17:27] strike that's why we are taught to watch
[1:17:30] and
[1:17:32] pray because the enemy he's not
[1:17:36] sleepy he's not sleepy and he's not
[1:17:40] joing your enemy the Bible tells us our
[1:17:43] adversary the devil is working about
[1:17:47] raring like a lion seeking whom he may
[1:17:51] devour that's right true
[1:17:53] that's
[1:17:55] right so we are not on picnic we are in
[1:17:59] a
[1:18:00] battle Watch and

[1:25:21] they are holding on to that oh God give
[1:25:24] us Grace today to know who we are and
[1:25:28] hold on to God's
[1:25:32] promises if Israel will look at the
[1:25:36] obstacles the number of people that are
[1:25:38] against them almost the whole world is
[1:25:40] standing against them but if they will
[1:25:42] look at that they will never move but
[1:25:45] they don't look at that they holding to
[1:25:47] the promise that we are Abraham's seed
[1:25:52] we are God's children the only Jewish
[1:26:00] Nation don't look at the
[1:26:03] obstacles don't look at the
[1:26:06] circumstances look at the
[1:26:08] promise and remember this there is
[1:26:12] something about what you look
[1:26:15] at brother Bram said the eye is a
[1:26:19] gateway so what you look at affects you
[1:26:23] he does something in your
[1:26:28] life what cost the four if so he look at
[1:26:33] that
[1:26:37] three what he look
[1:26:39] at why do we have a lot of
[1:26:42] adverts bballs advertising this and that
[1:26:46] and that it has something to do it
[1:26:49] affects
[1:26:51] you
[1:26:53] so there is something about what you
[1:26:55] look at in the scripture somewhere I
[1:26:58] think in Genesis 30 somewhere there you
[1:27:00] know Jacob even play a
[1:27:02] trick with the animals the cattles or
[1:27:05] the sheep and things and that and he fix
[1:27:07] something in the Gess and he said when
[1:27:10] the strong sheep come to give birth it
[1:27:12] feels them that they will be looking at
[1:27:13] the purples or purp trees whatever he
[1:27:15] has made and when they look at it they
[1:27:17] birth it they give birth to what they
[1:27:20] were looking at
[1:27:24] I don't know how it happened but the
[1:27:25] Bible says so and I just believe what
[1:27:27] the Bible
[1:27:28] says so there is something about what
[1:27:31] you look
[1:27:34] at because it's a Gateway your eye is a
[1:27:41] gateway so God tells us look unto me all
[1:27:45] ye ends of the
[1:27:47] Earth God is the same with his word so
[1:27:51] look to the the word what is the word
[1:27:53] the promises that God has given
[1:27:57] us no matter the obstacles no matter the
[1:28:00] difficulties look to
[1:28:02] me look at the
[1:28:06] promise Moses God was sending into Egypt
[1:28:09] he said who am I to go to Pharaoh I
[1:28:11] cannot go they are looking for me they
[1:28:13] will kill me God said I will be with you
[1:28:16] and you will bring the children of
[1:28:17] Israel out of
[1:28:21] Egypt keep your eyes on that promise
[1:28:23] look at the promise Moses went out in
[1:28:26] the power of that promise that God gave
[1:28:30] him why did the spies
[1:28:33] failed because they were looking at the
[1:28:37] obstacles oh we saw the Anakin we saw
[1:28:40] yes of course the Anakin were there the
[1:28:44] jebusites were there the amorites were
[1:28:47] there God already told them I am giving
[1:28:49] you De
[1:28:51] Land God knew they were there see you
[1:28:54] cannot tell God what is there what is
[1:28:55] not there God
[1:29:00] knows and they begin to look at those
[1:29:03] ones instead of looking at the
[1:29:08] promise they forgot that it is not by
[1:29:10] might nor by power but by the spirit of
[1:29:12] the Living God you are not even supposed
[1:29:15] to look at yourself am you are look he
[1:29:18] said because he said in our eyes we were
[1:29:20] like grasshoppers yeah and that is what
[1:29:23] we were in their sight so what did I say
[1:29:27] you should look at yourselves or look at
[1:29:28] the enemy I said keep your eyes on me
[1:29:31] look onto me I am the Creator I am the
[1:29:35] Almighty I am God and I change it not I

[1:38:25] brother Joshua do you remember what the
[1:38:27] prophet said about me said what he said
[1:38:30] when we went to spy the land when the
[1:38:32] rest of our Breen said they could not
[1:38:34] take the land do you remember I brought
[1:38:36] Revelation as it was in my heart I spoke
[1:38:38] to Prophet
[1:38:39] Moses when the rest were afraid when
[1:38:43] they said we could not make it you
[1:38:45] remember I told Moses we are well able
[1:38:47] to possess to overcome it oh yeah I do
[1:38:51] where did he he was reading the message
[1:38:53] and he got that
[1:38:54] quote what the prophet said about
[1:38:57] him the message became oh no wonder the
[1:39:00] prophet said Children of the light keep
[1:39:02] walking in the light watch and see more
[1:39:06] unfold that has been in the scripture or
[1:39:09] the message of
[1:39:12] Moses for years 45 years it was there
[1:39:16] but one day the light shine across it as
[1:39:19] he was reading it
[1:39:21] wo this is me it's about me and right
[1:39:27] there he went to the prophet Joshua is
[1:39:30] said Joshua do you remember that time
[1:39:33] look at this here see this
[1:39:35] quote calb son of death or what the
[1:39:39] father's name yeah I've given you this

[1:39:56] at that
[1:39:58] time give me the
[1:40:00] land give me the promise give me the
[1:40:02] authority give me allow let me
[1:40:05] go and I you remember that time our
[1:40:08] brothers said the Anakin were there the
[1:40:10] Giants were there I don't care who is
[1:40:14] there God gave me the promise God said
[1:40:18] it I believe it amen hallelujah he was
[1:40:22] not looking at us he was not even
[1:40:23] looking at
[1:40:25] himself he was looking at the promise so
[1:40:28] don't be looking at yourself there is
[1:40:30] nothing there look to God look to the
[1:40:32] word because the word
[1:40:35] inspires the word anoints the word
[1:40:38] strengthens o Hallelujah glory to
[1:40:43] God look at the
[1:40:47] promise look at Jonah in the belly of
[1:40:49] the fish what did he they said I will
[1:40:51] not look at these things around
[1:40:53] me I will not look at these things
[1:40:56] around me he said these are lying
[1:40:59] vanities what the tie my leg or my hands
[1:41:01] I'm not going to look at that because
[1:41:04] when you look at that you'll be
[1:41:06] affected you'll be weakened you'll be
[1:41:10] discouraged so I'm not going to look at
[1:41:12] these things no no no I look at the
[1:41:15] promise I look at the promise Solomon
[1:41:18] said when we are in trouble and we tend
[1:41:20] to go and the temple and we pray he
[1:41:23] their prayer and he look at the
[1:41:28] promise in that condition and he was
[1:41:32] loose he was free he was
[1:41:36] delivered the Bible saying God spoke to
[1:41:39] the
[1:41:39] fish huh God spoke to the
[1:41:43] fish it's okay take him out now and the
[1:41:47] fish
[1:41:48] obey everything obeys God
[1:41:51] every Power OB obeys God every demon
[1:41:54] obey God whatever force is they obey God
[1:41:58] God spoke to the fish move
[1:42:01] out because Somebody Prayed because
[1:42:05] somebody looked to the promise the
[1:42:07] promise that can never fail promise that
[1:42:10] Solomon that backed made and God honored
[1:42:14] it because somebody hold on to that what
[1:42:18] about the promise that Jesus gave us
[1:42:20] amen
[1:42:23] what about what he has told
[1:42:25] us all the promise he given to
[1:42:28] us what are we doing with it and we want
[1:42:32] to blame God
[1:42:40] no I'm I'm trying to close
[1:42:43] because
[1:42:46] Hallelujah
[1:42:49] woo ah
[1:42:51] one time okay let me
[1:42:53] res the prophet was speaking about
[1:42:55] somebody here said now now what made
[1:42:58] calb and so sure of it when the
[1:43:01] opposition was so great it is according
[1:43:04] to what you are looking at Caleb was
[1:43:08] looking at the promise of God the other
[1:43:10] 10 were looking at the
[1:43:13] circumstances if you go to look at the
[1:43:17] circumstances or to look at what's
[1:43:20] around you you are sure to fil but we
[1:43:25] must never look at what is around
[1:43:30] you what if that man sitting there look
[1:43:34] at the
[1:43:36] opposition by his boy there a in
[1:43:40] that chair what if this nice clean
[1:43:43] looking man sitting back there in the
[1:43:45] wheelchair look at the circumstances
[1:43:48] what if the lady laying in the chair
[1:43:51] leaning back look at the circumstances
[1:43:55] what if this poor blind woman leaning on
[1:43:57] a
[1:43:59] shoulder of
[1:44:02] another thought of the
[1:44:05] circumstances the doctor has tried he
[1:44:08] failed he a man like I am you are and if
[1:44:12] you look at that then you are going to
[1:44:15] be failure to begin
[1:44:17] with but the Christian doesn't look at
[1:44:20] the
[1:44:21] circumstances he looks at the word and
[1:44:24] stands
[1:44:25] still God says so that settles it what
[1:44:29] if Abraham I look at the
[1:44:31] circumstances if the doctor examine your
[1:44:34] heart that kisss more people than
[1:44:36] anything else the doctor examined your
[1:44:38] heart and said you might drop at any
[1:44:42] time you got a mamama that's true if you
[1:44:45] look at that then you are defeated to
[1:44:50] begin with
[1:44:51] look what God
[1:44:55] Said one time when the test was on when
[1:44:58] the Covenant people had come up out of
[1:45:00] Egypt led by the Holy Spirit Moses the
[1:45:03] great leader and the spies had went over
[1:45:06] into the promised land 10 of them came
[1:45:09] back and said we cannot take it they are
[1:45:13] too great we are too small but there was
[1:45:16] two men Caleb and Joshua who had been
[1:45:20] over there and they steal the people
[1:45:23] first thing one saying this and one
[1:45:26] saying that one saying this why did you
[1:45:29] bring us out here and all kinds of
[1:45:31] things ah why why why why did you do
[1:45:35] this and why did you do
[1:45:36] that and calb seal the people before
[1:45:39] Moses and said we are well able to go
[1:45:44] over and take it because it depends on
[1:45:49] what you are looking
[1:45:51] at some of them were looking at the
[1:45:54] obstacle the great armies and the great
[1:45:57] Wars and the great giant size of people
[1:46:00] but calb was looking at the promise of
[1:46:03] God and it was the hour had come when
[1:46:07] calb had to get the people stay before
[1:46:10] he could tell them the promise of God
[1:46:13] and I think that's the very needy thing
[1:46:16] today is for the people to stand still
[1:46:19] and see what God has
[1:46:22] promised it's a day that God is
[1:46:25] fulfilling his promise these things must
[1:46:28] be they've got to come therefore we must
[1:46:32] see the Promise and stand still and what
[1:46:35] God's salvation move into it God always
[1:46:39] works according to his word hallelujah
[1:46:42] it depends on what you are looking at if
[1:46:45] you look at your afflictions you will
[1:46:47] never go any further but if you look at
[1:46:51] the promise of God you've got a right to
[1:46:56] every Redemptive blessing that God
[1:46:58] promised in his word is yours right the
[1:47:02] Christian always looks at the Unseen
[1:47:05] things every Redemptive blessing of God
[1:47:08] is
[1:47:10] unseen may God be with us my brothers
[1:47:12] and sisters stop looking around you stop
[1:47:17] looking at your afflictions like i s the
[1:47:19] text to one of our sisters in a
[1:47:21] challenge I said sister don't be looking
[1:47:23] at your enemies the people against you
[1:47:25] in the place of work in your office I
[1:47:27] said don't look at that look at the
[1:47:29] promise of God as long as your mind is

[2:05:32] tonight I've been blessed I've been
[2:05:36] blessed amen right right right here
[2:05:38] tonight once again the goodness of the
[2:05:41] Lord God speaking to our hearts speaking
[2:05:45] to our lives so personal remind
[2:05:48] reminding us who we are reminding us our
[2:05:52] position reminding us of how our
[2:05:55] approach with everything and you know
[2:05:58] what I'm thankful for is when we can
[2:06:00] look to the Lord God gives Grace for us
[2:06:05] to rise to what he's calling us
[2:06:09] to he don't just give us
[2:06:12] Grace for a mistake we've made but God
[2:06:16] gives sufficient Grace to we can rise
[2:06:20] above that he's the same God who breaks
[2:06:25] veils and just like he came tonight in
[2:06:29] the Simplicity of his word but God comes
[2:06:32] to break
[2:06:33] veils because sometimes there's things
[2:06:36] that we can as even the message started
[2:06:38] tonight we can begin to look at things
[2:06:41] through our own
[2:06:43] thoughts through our own
[2:06:47] veils and you know God has to break that
[2:06:51] Veil brother Bram himself when he went
[2:06:53] when there was those who were um he
[2:06:57] tells about it in the bruised serpent
[2:06:58] they were you know wanting to baptize in
[2:07:01] his name and other things and brother BR
[2:07:02] went right to him and brother Bram when
[2:07:05] he went to him he said he sat down with
[2:07:07] those Brethren and brother Bram said I
[2:07:09] showed him what I did not say he said
[2:07:13] but they wouldn't hear it and he said
[2:07:15] see the reason why because it was a
[2:07:18] spirit
[2:07:19] that was veiling
[2:07:21] them then brother brandham prayed this
[2:07:23] is what I love brother Bram comes back
[2:07:25] and tells us what happened is he went
[2:07:27] and prayed for those Brethren because he
[2:07:30] realized just sitting down and showing
[2:07:32] them what he said they had see the power
[2:07:35] of conception they had brought a
[2:07:38] conception that even though brother Bram
[2:07:40] didn't say it they had conceived their
[2:07:43] own understanding and it was a veil
[2:07:45] that's how powerful a spirit is
[2:07:49] brother ad said he went and he prayed
[2:07:51] for the Brethren he continued to pray
[2:07:53] and he said God broke that spirit and he
[2:07:56] said then they turned to him and they
[2:07:58] said when they came back a few days
[2:08:00] later what sure brother bradam you never
[2:08:02] even said those things no he showed them
[2:08:05] what he
[2:08:06] said but that Veil that spiritual Veil
[2:08:10] would not allow him to see it I'm glad
[2:08:12] that God still breaks
[2:08:16] Veils I'm glad that he aren't you I'm
[2:08:18] glad I'm glad he comes and breaks veils
[2:08:20] in our minds veils in our lives veils of
[2:08:24] things and I'm so thankful for his grace
[2:08:27] I tell you the Lord has really spoke to
[2:08:29] us tonight amen it was so
[2:08:32] good I uh when brother Timothy was was
[2:08:36] asking and saying it wasn't that we
[2:08:38] didn't agree with it we agree I was just
[2:08:40] trying to make sure I took in every word
[2:08:43] I wanted everybody to take in every word
[2:08:45] it it was good it was right down
[2:08:49] it was very good hallu amen it so good
[2:08:54] amen now now we have the wonderful
[2:08:57] privilege of taking it and living
[2:09:00] it this is where the rubber meets the
[2:09:02] road now to take it and apply it and
[2:09:05] live by it and let the word change our
[2:09:07] life that's what it's for that's why God
[2:09:10] came to speak to us tonight and I want
[2:09:12] to be like that little
[2:09:14] boy all the rest of had come and tried
[2:09:16] to win that bicycle they asked this
[2:09:19] little boy got on there he would not
[2:09:21] have been the pick to win the bicycle
[2:09:23] the guy was not a good biker yes but he
[2:09:26] rode that bike down the plank and the
[2:09:28] rest of the fellas around asked him what
[2:09:31] was your secret he said what it was is I
[2:09:34] never took my eyes off of the
[2:09:37] end I focused on the end you see how
[2:09:41] Satan wants to distract with try to get
[2:09:43] us to look this way look at this look at
[2:09:46] that look at this
[2:09:49] because soon as we get our eyes off of
[2:09:50] the Lord Jesus we fail that's the
[2:09:53] failure is getting our eyes off of him
[2:09:55] the other things are just results of
[2:09:57] that so may God help us to keep our eyes
[2:10:01] on him no matter your situation no
[2:10:04] matter the problem whatever it is even
[2:10:07] that is before you and that you're
[2:10:08] praying about Look to
[2:10:11] Him Look to Him scripture after
[2:10:15] scripture and how God has come right
[2:10:16] back around tonight and just admonish us
[2:10:20] to encourage us encourage Us in these
[2:10:24] things he's with us amen amen God
[2:10:29] there's one thing God cannot fail he
[2:10:32] cannot lie he's
[2:10:34] faithful amen let's just go to him in a
[2:10:38] word of
[2:10:40] prayer
[2:10:42] father how we want to say thank you
[2:10:45] tonight Lord for your mercies once again
[2:10:49] thank you Father for God how that you
[2:10:52] brought brother Timothy back to us

[2:10:57] God that truly the purpose of God just
[2:10:59] like your Prophet taught us Lord that
[2:11:02] nothing can take us out of this Earth
[2:11:04] until the purpose of God has been
[2:11:06] fulfilled and we rest upon your word
[2:11:09] Lord to know that we're here for that
[2:11:11] purpose because your Prophet also said
[2:11:13] that when that purpose has been
[2:11:15] fulfilled he said I don't want to stay
[2:11:16] here a moment longer
[2:11:19] [Music]
[2:11:20] Lord thank you
[2:11:22] Father for touching our
[2:11:25] brother Lord to raise him up Lord to
[2:11:29] give him the strength that Lord he would

[2:11:37] able Lord to testify and give witness
[2:11:40] Lord and father be a channel that you
[2:11:43] can Minister through to encourage us as

[2:11:54] Lord that we might see clearly oh God
[2:11:57] even circumstances things that you would
[2:11:59] know that would be around us even right
[2:12:02] now but God you are our a way maker and
[2:12:05] without you we have no eyes Lord it
[2:12:09] takes you coming to anoint our eyes that
[2:12:11] we might see clearly the way we need to
[2:12:14] see Lord so we thank you Father as we
[2:12:17] were reminded tonight tonight Faith
[2:12:19] anoints us Lord looking at the Word of
[2:12:21] Promise it anoints us and I'm thankful
