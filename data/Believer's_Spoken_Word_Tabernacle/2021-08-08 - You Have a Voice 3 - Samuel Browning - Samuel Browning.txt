times you would see when israel would come into the land here would come into shiloh and then eventually here the place of worship would be established there jerusalem brother brown would pick it up in a future home and why why little bethlehem and he said the church in this last day has not been called to a station we've not been called just a justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost we've been called back home amen there this message cannot be denominated it's the original life the original seed that's returned to the church of the living god so we're not just we're not called to a station we are called to rapture amen we're called to rapture amen don't you love him this morning imagine it's good to be in the house of the lord amen let's just go to the lord in a word of prayer heavenly father we just lord are just so thankful to have this privilege and opportunity that we can be able to be gathered together lord as brothers and sisters of like precious faith lord father we we just lord are so grateful lord that lord jesus for what you've done and for what you're doing lord that our eyes would be opened our lives being transformed oh god we thank you so much lord jesus and lord we just we just want to invite you in a further part of this service lord there's needs lord throughout this building perhaps some lord streaming by way of the internet or others that will archive it lord at a later time lord you're mindful of every need you're mindful lord we just dear god just ask right now thinking of sister michelle lord we just ask right now that you'll just make a visitation there lord to the home lord and i pray you would just just brood upon her body lord and just oh god set everything in its right order lord i pray oh god may you just move down lord just the peace of god just moving lord in a special way oh god to just lord just raise our sister up lord we ask these things lord because you told us to ask lord you said if we asked for a piece of bread you wouldn't give us a stone so we're asking lord according to your word and the promises that pertain to us as your children lord and lord we just ask now lord for each need that's here upon every heart lord you know lord we just lord desire just just to be yielded and just reserve ourselves to the leading of the holy spirit and i just pray that you'll just come lord in a very personal way this morning lord and just dear god just perform your word lord to every heart to every life to every need o god lord we just love you and we thank you father in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen if you'll turn with me in the scriptures to leviticus 25 and as you're turning there some of you probably have you've seen the announcement of [Music] benjamin's uh graduation party and that all are welcome that's on saturday october or not october goodness i've got it in front of me and i said october maybe i'm thinking about hunting already it's on august 21st on saturday august 21st and um all are welcome it would help if you uh rsvp and just so we know the amount of food to have the directions you've most of you been there to the heritage presbyterian church that's there off of route 58 right in amherst and the lord willing will have his graduation party to be just like a fellowship dinner so he wanted to make you aware of that also i understand that the young people maybe not all they had a wonderful time on the water yesterday canoeing was a canoeing brother shane kayaking okay if i would have been there i had to look for a boat with a motor no i i enjoy the boats and paddles i uh finley park has a nice little thing out there too sometimes you can rent some of the uh i don't think it cost you anything does it at finley park i think you you're able to do that but they they had a good time going up the black river there for a little bit and i know had a good time of fellowship the the boys were certainly talking about it when they got home and uh so we i know whatever goes on there it stays there so so i know there's some pictures that probably will be posted there on the facebook page and things like that but let's just turn to the to well you're already there in leviticus 25 and let's just read here a few verses of scripture and thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee seven times seven years and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years then thou shalt cause the trumpet of the jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month in the day of atonement shall you make the trumpet sound throughout all your land you shall hallow the 50th year and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you and you shall return every man unto his possession and ye shall return every man unto his family and a jubilee shall that fiftieth year be unto you ye shall not sow neither reap that which groweth of itself in it nor gather the grapes in it of divine undress for it is the jubilee it shall be holy unto you you shall eat the increase thereof out of the land in the year of this jubilee ye shall return every man unto his possession amen may god bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated just just drawn to this thought and we've been looking at this for a few services and there's a place we're trying to get to within it and but i want to continue to speak on that thought you have a voice because when you see here in the scripture god has given a direction that you shall cause the trumpet of the jubilee to sound and that then it's given a designated time of when that trumpet is to sound and i believe that if we could just move ahead just a few moments and just where we're going to work where we're working towards is the reality of us having a voice is where it's not just our voice as far as my voice that you would hear here or your voice or sound of it and somebody recognizes our voice but it's the voice of god's own life that sounds through our lives and that's that's where we're working to you have a voice because this liberty is not a liberty that is alone proclaimed in at a at a church or at the church though it is a place that we gather it's a place that the word of god is preached and it goes forth but your lives just like mine and everybody else is to be a life that proclaims that the liberty of jesus christ is here right now and true there's things that many can ask you and look at your life and sometimes you get questions such as where do you go to church or what do you believe or this or that and what they're asking about is the expression of the life that's being lived out and remember it's not altogether our words that actually have the greatest impact it's the life that speaks so much louder than the words because many times it's our life it's the things that we will will how we conduct ourselves in our life that draws the attention and it's actually drawing the attention to the right thing and that's to the lord jesus christ and these are things that you know when you think of the slave who was in the field and remember they came the one who wanted to purchase a slave they came by and they were looking there and they wanted to buy a certain one because they noticed that there were things about him that was standing out differently from others now it wasn't his color it wasn't his stature it wasn't his height it was his conduct that separated him from the rest of the slaves and so that conduct is the character of life that was being expressed and that's exactly the voice that god has called us to it's not our character that's on display it's the character of jesus christ that is moving and molding and shaping our character to announce that there is a liberty that is present upon earth right now that anyone who wants to be free can indeed go free now we know that everyone will not receive it everyone will not hear it even people who come and uh inquire of the things that sometimes are in our life sometimes it isn't right then and there that it that it they respond to it sometimes it's a period of time later but what's important is the seed itself that whatever the expression and what's going out of our life that it is seed and it's a seed of god because when seed when that seed of god of the word of character is sown then it invites a channel for the supernatural to move because whenever you know you get away from a person and whatever more and what they can go back and remember they may not altogether remember the words that you say but they remember the impression of the life and the spirit that is around your life and that's what has an impact on people's lives and so we recognize that in this time we do have a voice and i want to just lay some of these things in and just see how the lord will will take us and i don't want to go so quickly on this because there's directions there's things i want to move into here if the lord terry's even in to some coming services but to understand that as god places it here in leviticus 25 that there's an allotted portion that is given uh for every son and daughter of god that even when they were down there in egypt and here they were they were they were awaiting a promise of god to come their way israel was waiting then and there had to be a way that where they would be brought out of that bondage and god said i'll do it by a mighty hand and we recognize that then them coming into the land because god said i will come there and i will bring my people up out of the land of egypt and into the land of promise now we realize that redemption itself has two parts it's a coming out of and are going into and so it all is a work of god it's god working to draw us out and bring us in because as long as we're still closed off we can never be brought in so the word it comes to first of all it's proclaiming a liberty it's proclaiming a freedom and that begins to rise within a life to have faith in the word that we are hearing that we might come into this land and the land itself that we're speaking of i have a visual but i didn't send that to him we'll probably get to this but the land itself that we're referring to when you think of israel israel here is a little uh just a little speck of land if i can say it that way it doesn't look it doesn't look really big in in comparison to other land mass but god was so interested in that part and to see that within all that that part of the land of israel it was a type of our inheritance that's in jesus christ and he is the word and within that within that land of of israel each one of them were to have their parts that would be divided remember god told joshua that you're to divide uh the inheritance among the children of israel how would that inheritance be divided god didn't leave it to just joshua to try to figure it out it was divided by inspiration but it was not inspiration that was a apart from the word it was inspiration that was by the word remember when god lays all of this out in the book of numbers as he's coming through there that joshua and it says it just like this that that that joshua elias are the the high priest and the urim thummim this these shall divide to you the inheritance of the lamb because our inheritance it comes to us by the holy spirit which is also our great high priest and what is he ministering to you and i not a creed not a dogma not a false hope not a sensation he's ministering to you and i the true spiritual blessings that belong to us in christ jesus he's ministering to us the word so the inheritance of our inheritance does not come any other way but by the word of god this is why brother branham when he takes in the adoption series and you'll hear him come into places and say the mystery of god and when you hear that phrase the mystery of god it's speaking of the baptism of the holy ghost our inheritance the seal of the holy ghost it's speaking of all those things that are the same and he says the mystery of god cannot be taught or learned in a seminary the mystery of god is the sovereignty and the grace of god that is revealed to you and i and god reveals it in such a simple way that it bypasses the intellect of man but it comes to a generation that we might come into our position in christ so that when it's all said and done there's not one of us can take glory in ourselves we can say it's all god it's all god so it's an allotted portion that we are we are called to this is an inheritance that as a free-born son of israel he had an inheritance let's say that his family was judah within that allotted portion that was given to judah in the land of israel every family had their place in that family of judah or if they were out of the family of issachar they had their place in that portion of the land this is why no one can take your place and it is wide that it's so imperative that we come into our position because it all works the body of jesus christ let me say it in this way the body of jesus christ the members of the body of jesus christ do not operate independent from one another but rather it is an interdependent working of a sovereign work of the holy spirit in every individual life that places us in the body so that the hands are with the arm the arm is with the rest of you you understand what i'm saying so that it brings the entire body and the body itself is the word so this is how god is be and so with the body just like your hand or my hand or nose or whatever every part of our body it is to serve a function is that right even the parts that you're standing up here right now you don't see my heart i mean maybe unless i'm really you know a little nervous you might say man the tie's moving or whatever you don't see it but you know did you know it's operating i'm still standing here is that right respiratory system you know that it's working and operating because i've still got breath to preach right you don't see that but everything is working in a necessary manner to serve a purpose so that's a little bit of a vision of where we're going here this jubilee is to bring it's a liberty so the day of atonement when we look at this of how the trumpet was just the trumpet of the jubilee was to sound and was to proclaim that 50th year it was a proclaiming of liberty when it would be sounded but the day of atonement was every year at the appointed time are you with me the day of atonement there has been a ministry down through the ages that has continued to speak and declare that the lord jesus christ is our all-sufficiency are you with me but they can only declare according to the light that is revealed to them there was word when it started out on the day of pentecost it was a complete sounding it was a jubilee that was being sounded out at that time that was calling the sons and daughters of god to the promise that god had declared and made real in that hour this was this was the true pentecost but you're aware that here after you know uh 33 years and or after you know that that period of time then it goes into we enter into that first church age of that ephesian age and when it enters into there there's already been those parts where god remember as he said in the ephesian age i have somewhat against thee you see it's one of those things that we don't even want god to have one speck against us is that right we don't even want him to have somewhat because that somewhat she was already fallen why was she fallen because satan had come in to tamper with the real true experience of the depth of the life of jesus christ coming into a life how did satan tamper with that life by tampering with the prescription with the word is that right he began to just tamper with that a little bit because remember our inheritance comes by the word that this is why brother and sister that the holy ghost does not come outside of the revealed word of the hour a person can truly receive the holy spirit on their flesh and on their spirit justification sanctification but remember what jesus said he will send the promise of the spirit in my name and his name is his character is his word is that right this is how the holy spirit comes it comes through the word because the holy spirit is that earnest deposit of your inheritance and it comes to you through the word and so how by you hearing the word you're hearing the holy spirit speak to you this is your inheritance so even though the day of atonement every year there in the month of october or or you know the day when the month of october forgive me i i just let me just move with this a moment but the day of atonement would be proclaimed every year there and yet now god would have a special a lot of time that after seven sabbaths or after seven church ages there would come a sounding because the bible tells us in revelations 10 verse 7 that when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished so it was the finishing of the entire body every part coming into its position in the body and it is god his voice that sounds through and the finishing of the mystery of god which is our inheritance the baptism of the holy ghost the seal of the living god our position in christ as adopted sons and daughters of god so you you see that there is a reconciling that takes place and brother brown would always he he he says in uh christ a mystery he reads out of first colossians there and he's dealing with that reconciliation and he says i want you to know watch where this reconciliation went see the reconciliation just doesn't stop in us being reconciled to christ in this life but that reconciliation here we are to go into my father's house are many mansions see it's a calling from not only called us from a life of sin from under bondage into a liberty where we've received the spirit of that land which is an earnest of our inheritance but it's calling us into a full reconciliation to where not only our souls have been reconciled but to where that in our spirit which we receive the theophany in place of the human spirit and this body receiving a glorified body it's a time of reconciliation it's the word itself that has come to bring us back into our rightful position so brother branham would say it like this in the jubilee year and i'm just going to maybe skip down to the second paragraph i have there and he says when this jubilee year come by then the priest rode the land sounding the trumpet that's very important he just could not blow it in jerusalem because those out there in other places couldn't hear it you have a voice that voice of liberty reaches out to places my voice could never reach because it's not my voice anyhow it's not brother branham's voice it's the voice of god that was sealed within that voice and it's the same voice of god in the bride of jesus christ right now but samuel i can't put it all together it's not about that you can put it all together it's about is there a life that is lived in harmony with the word that is a voice that speaks louder than any placing together of scriptures and quotes and every other thing it's a life that's lived oh glory be to god this is our inheritance when this jubilee year come by then the priest rode the land sounding the trumpet and every slave that had been bought with a price and become a servant was given the privilege to be made free go back home again back to his loved ones he was redeemed back by grace he didn't have to pay anything his loved ones didn't have to pay anything it was an act of god oh what a beautiful illustration today that men and women in our country and everywhere else has sold their self out to sin drinking gambling carousing doing things that they ought not to do and become slaves to the devil so the priest would ride throughout the land now remember in the type as we were looking at and we read from the scripture that there is to be a fulfillment of the type in the antitype this priest could would sound he would ride throughout the land what was he proclaiming when he blew that trumpet it was announcing that the day of atonement that there had had been uh not only the blood of the heifer had been offered up you know for for his sins because this priest also had to offer it for his sins because he was born uh of a woman is that right this priest he was born of so he had to offer blood for his own sin then he would offer up then the a live goat for that of the of the people and then from the light goat he would put his hands upon the scapegoat we've heard of scapegoats right maybe you were used used as one at work or something but you've heard escape goats and this is where all the iniquities and the sins were cast upon that scapegoat and a fit man the bible says is to take that scapegoat not just to let the scape go like go out here in the parking lot no you take it to a land uninhabited because that scapegoat it bore the iniquities and the sins it bore everything from that year and that scapegoat would never come back into the camp of israel again out there in an uninhabited land you would never come back again no doubt there would be that of an animal a wild animal that would take it what did that represent that when a life has been made free by the blood of jesus christ there is a blood that's able to pack away every sin and change the nature so that you're never haunted anymore there's come such a separation down in the depths of your soul that you know i'm not the same man or same woman than i used to be my desires have been changed and it's christ he's everything he's the only thing i care about he's the only one i want to please he's my desire what is that that is then evidence that there has been a reconciling in that life so the priest himself would ride throughout the land and his blowing was announcing what the others couldn't see somebody in another place because they weren't privileged to go into the tabernacle they were not privileged to look and see all of this being offered up they couldn't see that but this sound let them know the blood's been shed the atonement all has been made there's a reconciling and you have been reconciled with it so the sound was actually the declaration the blood has been spilled and accepted and you have been accepted in by the blood you're free so the sound had a voice had significance it spoke that the blood had been shed and that you can go free but you realize that this was a type there must come that anatype and there had to come one who was free from the sexual birth it could not because you know man here he was man it had come to place to where there's no one was worthy no one could bring that really restoration no one no even though all of the holy prophets they were they were men that spoke as the spirit of christ would move upon them but it was still in the negative it can only come into the positive when the very spirit of christ that moved upon them in portion after portion after portion remember the people would fall they would call them back people would fall away they would call them back people would fall away they would call them back it only spoke that there was coming a real true jubilee to where god by his sovereign grace could bring his children into a place that's impossible to fall from he could bring him into a place of such divine security by the grace of god coming and being manifested in their life god was announcing that there is coming a time that this indeed will no longer be just a type but it will become a place of security so there had to come one who was free from sexual birth they had to come one that had the blood that had a power to loosen and to think you know when god made the first man he made him a son is that right adam was his created son but adam fell by disobedience is that right the bible says in timothy eve was deceived adam fell in disobedience adam was not ignorant of what was taking place he he was it was right out there disobedient and he went out there to take uh that place so that that it that that his wife would not be consumed now think of this here brother batman will lay this out in the message the token and he says therefore he says i don't have this i don't believe up there but he says therefore he says the whole human race that was born was in sin there was no way to come out every one of us were born in sin shaped in iniquity we come to the world speaking life there was no way oh brother samuel my parents were message believers you still came you still came with no way out as parents we we do what god has instructed and given us to do remember with with parenting and things there's all there's the part there's the two parts the moses and joshua moses statutes and judgments and commandments right boundaries are you with me but moses never took him into the land [Music] joshua takes him in the same joshua the same holy ghost that brought you in but you see when they came into the land what were they doing the fulfillment of the word that had been given to moses this is why it's important to lay in the word or lay the word in as parents not just speaking it but living it setting standards setting standards and it's not always about chapters and verses but even the standards of the word that's given and are everything we do our discipline and everything it should be centered upon the word because real true discipline is not about irritation at the moment true discipline brother bram tells us in the seventh church age discipline is with a vision in mind god is seeing our future and he's knowing if we don't get it corrected here when we get way on down the line it'll really be off so when god disciplines it's just like you know brother bram will bring it in other places you know you find the boy who's laying down on the floor throwing a temper tantrum in the you know in the in the store if that never gets corrected he may not lay in the floor with his wife and throw a temper tantrum but he'll actually have ways of getting his own way how can that be well you see there's certain things that are inherent of that first nature this is why the bible says that with the rod foolishness is driven out of the heart of the child god brings his word to do what drive out the foolishness of our heart because god realizes the actions the behaviors why it is the way it is is because foolishness is bound up in the heart but if it can ever it can get that foolishness driven out of the way this is why he that cometh to god must be must be first tried and chastened and the chastening never ends in our life but it's god working and bringing correction in our life and remember a person that refuses correction from the word is not a son but it's an illegitimate bastard-born one is that right that's scripture that's plain this is why it's a blessing to even be corrected and be able to be corrected because that's what sons and daughters do they receive the correction of the word oh my so you see it's god working in in such a divine way to bring us into this place brother brahman says now he says what happened is god came down and there's only one way to get him back that's to get him back a son again because there's no no one that was up on earth you had elijah you had a moses you had jeremiah you had all them but none of them could actually sufficiently pay the price for you or me because that was a polluted blood are you with me it was a polluted blood underneath that blood was still all condemnation there could never be be a loosening or freedom come so god had to get him back a son again so what god had to do was become a part of his own creation it was a fallen creation but god himself now steps forward and in fulfillment of his word that he said back there in eden i will make a way back for you he was announcing that your inheritance oh my will not be gone forever but i'm gonna bring you back to your inheritance i'll make a way back and when the lord jesus stood here he said i am the way the truth and the life so the way back is the very person of god himself come down there in the form of jesus christ god getting himself a son back again where the blood itself the creative blood of almighty god god spoke the word remember to mary and mary said how shall this be seeing i know not a man and he said the holy ghost shall overshadow thee so the very the very word of god has spoken the holy spirit came and brought the creation according to the word it was a body that was not linked or a part of that of mary or joseph are you with me it was not part of the polluted bloodstream that was here upon this earth but it was already under the freedom and liberty of the word oh my mama the word already had been spoken now god getting himself a son back and brother brahm said how can he do it when his own law stood there and said he's condemned we were all condemned is that right condemned there wasn't anybody can anybody stand up is anybody worthy can anybody do this can any can anybody take the book is anybody worthy nobody i mean brother branham steps back there in the message of breach and he lets us know the expanse you know we could have looked and said elijah he's a pretty good man jeremiah he's a pretty good man all of them were good men but not one of them qualified to be the kinsmen redeemer but the one who sent jeremiah the one who anointed jeremiah the one who spoke through jeremiah that same one wrapped up and gathered everything that he had spoke to jeremiah through abraham through noah through elijah three lashes through all of us he gathered all the loose ends and gathered them unto himself to reveal himself that indeed he's the same god all the way on down not a part of the rainbow but now the full covenant son is on the scene he gathers the word unto himself and what is revealed he reveals himself i was there in jeremiah was there an elijah i was there in moses everything identifies him so brother braham says then the father himself become one of us that's the real lamb jesus wasn't a second person if jesus is anything different from god we're still in our sins are you with me that that's not that we're still condemned you see then the father himself become one of us that's the real lamb that's his purpose he had in the mind and brother braham goes through of how that it's always been the lamb from the very uh onset right there in the garden of eden not to think of it that the first man the bible tells us in first corinthians 15 that the first man adam was made a living soul but the second adam was the quickening spirit the lord from heaven is that right almighty god come down you see it had to be god come down in the by his spirit the quickening power and he comes to the tabernacle that he has prepared according to his word you see this is why when you reach back to moses and moses is given a pattern on how to make the tabernacle it wasn't his idea it was god's idea so when god came on the scene and filled that tabernacle that was god saying now what was in my mind that has been spoken is now become manifested god is vindicating the revelation that was revealed to moses so it wasn't moses pattern it was god's pattern but we could preach it right down in our homes marriages everything else if you want god to come you operate according to his pattern godly god is moved when he sees his word that you see why the bride will be taken away in rapturing glory is because he's coming to what his word where the bride has come into the pattern of the word of that same pattern of the word that was delivered there on the day of pentecost and the same spirit of god that calls back the dew the dove calling who who who and brother rem says it becomes to that place to welcome back the lord jesus christ to take us from here in rapturing grace who has made us he has made us we're his workmanship we haven't put ourselves this way but it's yielding to the pattern of his word by his spirit that brings us in position like it did for elijah and the fire came down it's the same way for rapturing grace in our life what do i have to do brother samuel just keep yielding to the pattern amen the vision is sure i know it sure just as sure as the brown bear was there right the bam tells us that in the message countdown it was sure but you but it but he missed it because he wasn't where god told him to be that was an example for you and i you know i read that to you some thursdays ago this god that's why the rapture is a sure thing what must i do be in the place that god has us to be where is that in christ in christ amen so the greatest event that would take place would happen down at the river jordan here where the tabernacle here where the the vessel is surrendered and and and the spirit of god drawing upon the lamb of god remember it was the spirit of god that sought him out is that right brahman said it sought him out in perfect obedience it was the same quickening spirit that began to seek him out it began to draw him into this time into this place why it's time it's time for a further stepping in to that place of the word that's to be fulfilled and to be served in that hour there had already been the fulfillment of a virgin shall conceive is that right mary was as a seed of abraham a royal seed she believed what the angel said and just simply stood there upon the word that was spoken to her and god brought the word to pass in her life is that right then we find that here here stands the lord jesus and now here he is and the place of that of the word that's to be fulfilled the purpose of his coming now how the holy spirit has drawn him into this place and he walks down to the river jordan to be baptized of john why because he's to be the sacrificial lamb the lamb's got to be washed before it can ever be offered he didn't come to be baptized like you and i because he had to repent no he didn't have to repent he was the virgin-born son of the living god is that right he also came there because before the high priest can ever enter in to his service he's got to be washed and anointed by the prophet is that right so all of these things you see this isn't man's doing it's god arranging it what was a word that was then a vision now is becoming material and the places for where the glasses and the handkerchief and all those parts are to be god is orchestrating it all into its place what did the lord jesus have to do he just yielded amen don't worry this doesn't mean i'm going to be much longer the engine just got a little warm it felt a little good to me there for a while and but you know the greatest event that that took place i want you to listen to this in the message breach the breach brother brown sounds the sound he says there was a required a kinsmen redeemer and the kinsmen redeemer must be born of the human race here that leaves us on a limb why because nobody was worthy watch what he says but let me sound the trumpet to you this is not a church trumpet a church trumpet calls you to a church calls you to a man calls you to an idea this is not a church trumpet but sound the trumpet oh my and when the trumpet sounds it brings disturbance it brings war it brings interruption but to the believer oh my there's something greater than even all of the requirements that it's calling for to separate from father mother sister brother everything else there's a greater call that's going on and to the bride of jesus christ as a son and daughter of god what they are hearing is this is exactly what i've been longing for my whole life why because you are a part of the word that have been sounded in this hour because this word holds the very manifestation of the character and position in christ of who you really are that's why you can't get enough of the word sure we look at the word sometimes and say god help me lord help me to live in lord we look at it but you see there's a yearning there's a drawing on your life this word means more to you than anything else it means more than any relationship any friendship it comes to a place that anything that rises against the sounding of this trumpet you forsake it why this is your inheritance [Applause] oh my you don't go from slavery into slavery jubilee is not forcing you and beating you and this that's not the jubilee it's simply the sounding of the trumpet that it resonates down in the depths of the believer remember the example and i don't remember who it was but they gave the a book to the person they worked with and the person read the book and said that man called me a crow and the other the brother said it's funny when i read it call me an eagle [Applause] but samuel for some reason sometimes i hear a i hear about a crow but what's your heart say come on now let's pin this devil down amen brother samuel he tells me that that ain't god telling you that what must i do go by the desire that's in your heart the desire that's in your heart let you know that you are not a crow but you are an ego of the living god you've got a desire on the inside to serve god let me sound the trumpet to you the virgin birth produced the product the virgin birth produced our kinsmen redeemer none other but the almighty god become emmanuel one of us emmanuel the kinsman redeemer was met so you see how god makes a requirement and there's nothing we can do but then grace steps in and overshadows that law and produces the product i might just jump ahead just for a little bit so that i can so i identify even this what we just read you might look at it or anybody else could say well it's been preached down through time that jesus is the kinsman redeemer that's been preached and that's been preached and it has been preached there's continually been a sounding out oh this is the day of atonement the lord jesus christ paid the debt for our sins he paid the debt but you see there must come a sounding of jubilee that's not just causing us to look back in in a sense of where then we come into a church idea where a person can repent but never going on any further to a place of where they experience real true liberty and become yoked with the word of god so there had to come a sounding of the trumpet in this hour that was not tied to denominational theories of man this is why god could not open up the seven seals inside of a denomination he had to open them outside are you with me this is why coming out going in god could not open the seven seals in that of a denomination he had to open it outside and outside of the nomination outside of their theories outside of their thoughts god sounded forth his word and no there were many people who stood right around it set right behind it on the platform but it never had a meaning to their life i'm just going to tell something as it's coming to me right now one of the brothers when i was in arizona reminded me of this and i thought you know i forgot a little bit about that but you're aware when brother branham when he preaches what house will you build me and he preaches it at brother perry green's dedication brother brother brown gets up you know he's exhorting the people and and where we're at to me it's a very i to me it's a very prophetic message because it's a it's calling to us as children of god what house will you build me right he wasn't only dealing with uh uh uh uh the full uh working as a body in the local body yet brother branham speaks about that but he's dealing with that our lives must bear the flame of the hour then brother adam makes a statement and he says now i'm going to jack morris but he said you know brother jack doesn't see this message he said but i'm going to go down there he said i'm not going to preach doctrine he said but however he said if god leads me to do something i'll go ahead and do it now you're aware of those messages in 1965 in november on the wings of a snow white dove invisible union of the bride of christ i've heard but now i see i i know i'm forgetting one in there now you hear brother branham on one of those messages it might be on the wings of a snow white dove i can't remember exactly but you hear brother brown talking about how brother jack moore came to his room and brother branham wasn't in the room and brother jack moore got the wrong room and he's like my what what's going on you know what what's going on here you know and he's not even in the right room and and so they don't end up meeting and brother bram stands on the platform he said well brother jack you can you can take me out for a steak dinner another time the reason brother jack moore was coming is because they weren't going to let him preach no more but god had other plans [Applause] god had other plans amen you see even though others and look we don't look down on anybody because they can't see it because if there's no inheritance that's calling to them then there's nowhere to go but this this causes you see this is why this word doesn't call us to a station it calls us to our inheritance there's no stopping for you and i you might say brother samuel i just seem like that then i can't get content well you're content in that christ himself has changed your life but there's something moving within you that desires to be closer to be closer to be more like him and the word comes to you and it stirs up your life what is it you are being called by the spirit of god through the word to that other land you can't stop hallelujah you can't stop hallelujah so where are we now as we think of this here where are we now in luke 4 i'm going to read from here and try to bring this down to a place you see the scriptures brother brown would say it over and over when he preaches birth pains and this day this scripture is fulfilled you've heard him say it in other places every scripture has a compound meaning is that right so brother brown picks this up and he's reading this here in luke chapter 4 verse 14. jesus returned in the power of the spirit into galilee and there went out of fame of him throughout all the region round about and he taught in their synagogues being glorified of all when he came to nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and stood up for to read so jesus he was the word made flesh is that right and he went to church there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet isaiah i'm sorry i don't believe that this was by coincidence the priest might have said well i was going to read out of jeremiah but i was pulled to isaiah even though the priest couldn't understand what was taking place it was god directing it at that moment are you missing me and that was delivered unto him the book of prophet the prophet isaiah notice he didn't go get it it was delivered to him remember when brother branham stood there in the message birth pains looking through the scripture brother graham was asking and why that don't sound right that's that's not the right verse and he's trying to read that out of there and no brother jack what verse is that was how are they telling him 16 luke 6 you know john 16 21 well yeah certainly that's exactly right and brother brown turns and he's looking well then brother brown goes right well that's not it i tell you he said i don't know what's going on he said there's been a misprint in this bible yep sure the world there's been a misprint and here comes bishop stanley representing the church the church had held the word all that time and he takes his bible and he tells the prophet just be be still my son god will show you something here you see what's happening it's a repeat of luke 4. but luke 4 jesus when he read this he stopped right in the middle of isaiah 61 he stopped in the place before it read of the second coming or judgment why that was not the position in the first coming to be fulfilled but in this hour amen it's calling to jubilee and judgment is here judgment is coming let me finish reading here he found the place where it was written the spirit of the lord is upon can you you imagine this he's reading the word but it's not just reading it it's happening the spirit of the lord is upon me he's declaring what has been prophesied is now taking place [Music] what was something to come now is the spirit of the lord is upon me you see how he could declare his position in the word almighty when the spirit of god it comes upon you this is what it brings you can declare yourself in the word and say i know that my life it lines up with the word my desire on the inside it's jesus christ this is this is life to me this hasn't just been something that's given me good morality he is my life i am his son i am his daughter the spirit of the lord is upon me who's to me the me is the son and daughter of god on the inside because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to senate liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the lord and he closed the book gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all them were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears what was it the trumpet was sounding what was the trumpet it was the word delivered by the spirit of god that was quick in there in that moment and it was declaring what you have heard you now see it is standing right here before you this scripture that was word is now standing in flesh before you what was he declaring it was a transition from law to grace because the law can never make the word flesh but grace makes the word flesh that's why you and i are trophies of grace everything was met and satisfied in our passover the lord jesus christ he is that true atonement you see the sounding as we said moments ago when brother remember said let me sound that true trumpet to you remember i know i'm covering some ground here but in leviticus 16 where it speaks of the feast of the lord the passover is offered it's the passover lamb that is offered in that time it's the offering of that lamb that invites and makes way for the holy ghost to come the day of atonement when you read it in leviticus 23 it is not speaking of the fresh killing of the lamb but it actually the day of atonement is pointing back to that passover lamb that was already killed you see that's why the word the message that you and i have received it's not a new message this is why the opening of the seven seals is not something outside of the book it is what is inside of the book to where that satan has wanted to sew up that life and a real true experience with the lord jesus christ but god himself reserved a life and a vessel according to the word in this hour to sound out to you and i that's what the real gospel message is it is a message of loosening a message that calls us back to the true atonement we're not called to a church we're not gathered around a personality no sir the sounding of this word does not lift up a man the sounding of this word exalts jesus christ for he said if i be lifted up i will draw i will cause an inward impelling draw o men unto me men binds men to men under the spirit of fear amen but the love of god don't bind us it sets us free and love it don't bind us it unites us oh my how accurate the scripture is brother branham would say i don't i don't have this on there how the lord jesus stopped at that point in isaiah 61. he stopped right before that part of announcing of judgment there was a part that had to be fulfilled you see it was declaring at that time that the acceptable year the jubilee is on and the blood had not even been shed yet but you see what was taking place it was a manifestation the second adam was manifesting to the sons and daughters of god what they fell from they weren't back in there to see what took place in eden they weren't there when adam stood there and controlled the elements and said when stopping and this and that they weren't there to see it but god came down the inheritance of his own life of what belonged to a son and daughter of god you see it wasn't a position in a natural land it was life god's own life that we fell from and that life came down in an earthen vessel what was it doing it was declaring the time of jubilee is at hand that's what god did and is doing in this hour through the ministry of malachi 4. luke 17 and 30 revelations 10 7 it was the declaring the evidence of life brother ram stands there in this day the scriptures fulfilled he said it's not me that's doing this it's god performing his own word that he promised so what is our faith building you know how it is if somebody you know you've seen people heard of people that oh so and so pray for me they'll follow that person to the ends of the earth it won a bit more that person that healed you than nothing it's faith are you with me so in order to have real faith it takes a living god to come on the scene because we'll not make it by our own faith a church faith it's got to be the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me it must be that faith that comes into the church of the living god is that right oh glory brethren said think of it the messiah standing in the platform to identify himself with the word of promise for that age how strange the messiah standing up before the church and precious words went out of his mouth to preach the acceptable year of the lord he was the word made flesh to represent the jubilee was on i'm telling you you don't ever read about demon manifestation until the word's been made flesh when the word was made flesh what did it do it roused up demon manifestation you have legion you have the rest of them but you know what it is is the word is there to proclaim jubilee and there's a there's a heart that even though with legion being so far away but there was what he heard the woman with the issue of blood she heard blind bartimaeus he heard he was had was blinded what was it faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god they heard about it it stirred something in there that was greater that was greater than all the demons that had legion that and that which was when the heart of that woman it was greater than her issue of blood that which the blindness of blind blind bartimaeus hit with the stirring in his heart was greater than all the blindness that was about his life god was present to loosen liberty had come and let me say liberty has come freedom is here amen and let me just say not only here but here amen let me just bring it down now it was calling man that was under the first representation of the first adam that was condemnation but he was the second adam calling them to life now there was many religious men in that day when they heard it beelzebub ah fortune teller oh he's taking away our crowds now they could say they were seeds of abraham naturally speaking they were right they could say we've got inheritance right here some levites you know levites didn't have any inheritance they only were given the cities and things like that they could go through all that but they couldn't hear the true inheritance they couldn't hear it they called it every foul name is that right but then you take a woman that nobody wanted nothing to do with her that's right she had to go to the well it wasn't a convenient time i'd imagine it wasn't a choice time to be going to the well if you know what i mean you wouldn't want to be a one even if you were in desperate need at that time and maybe you were a woman it was virtuous you'd say i ain't going to well at that time because i don't want nothing to be thought about me but jesus said i've got need amen i got neat amen jesus came down to the well on a time that was not the most choice time by that of the world but it was in god's time amen everything was lining up we could say like this the stars were lining up everything was just lining up and he begins to come down there and they begin to speak and begins to talk to her and she begins to rehearse certain promises that she's known she has questions here stands the answer to every question here stands the satisfier to every longing little did she know she was going to go to that well that day and when she left she'd never be the same amazing she was all covered up with sin where nobody would have touched her they wouldn't have invited her didn't want to be seen around her but jesus came what happened to her when he said i am he that speaketh unto thee all the scriptures and all the promises she had and he came like the laundry ticket and gave her an experience according to the word she just didn't have the word anymore she had an experience that was matched in the word she left there and she began to proclaim come see a man that hath told me everything i ever done the rest of the religious at that day what did they do they crucified him they didn't want nothing to do with him we're talking about the people who knew the scriptures i'm talking about the people that on sunday schools charts charts had every gold sticker are you hearing me it's not to know the word is life it's not to know the testimonies of the prophetess life it's not to know the message as far as just knowing the quotes that's not it right it's to know him because when you know him then you've got everything amen he revealed he's right there to break off little by little by little as we have need of it lord i i don't understand this and here he is oh they're asking for revelation well who's the only one who can reveal only he can so when you're asking him lord would you reveal yourself more to me oh that draws him near he loves to come and reveal himself and his word and he just keeps breaking off peace after peace after peace after peace amen let's close there was a decision brother branham says that in this this day the scripture's fulfilled he ties us into that jubilee he says when the gospel is preached the acceptable time the time of jubilee anybody no matter who you are what color you are what denomination you belong to how far you've stooped in sin or what's wrong with you you can go free when you hear the gospel trumpets sound out you are free see the word isn't calling and saying you can be it's declaring you're free why the blood has already been shed the price for liberty has already been paid then then what must i do have faith in what he speaks unto you remember you come to heal up heal the brokenhearted bind him up he came to heal came to man minister healing to our lives so you can have the healing in our soul which is the greatest healing of all because you the soul then can never be sick again but some but you get sick in your body sometimes you get weary in your mind sometimes you get you get you get down you can get discouraged but remember part of this jubilee is you've got a right to healing you've got a right to joy that's right the bible says happy are the people who know the lord is that right a merry spirit it's like medicine that's the book of proverbs right but it talked about i don't remember the exact words but how you know a spirit that uh i don't remember the words forgive me but it's that which is the opposite that of mary it driveth the bones see this says exactly to think this is this is why god's desire through his word he god don't put us up somewhere and we're just but the word itself even as it's being spoken our hearts are being lifted are being stirred is being encouraged any darkness or doubt that's tried to encroach in upon your life it's being dispelled how is that happening faith rises to believe what he is saying concerning you it's god letting us know our inheritance he's letting us know this is what belongs to you you see there's there's nothing that that you have to settle for there's nothing short of full deliverance there's nothing short of full healing everything that god has for you the maturing in our life every part that pertains to us in our inheritance that god has brought us to we are to occupy and we shall occupy every part that he's called us to so what must i do get your eyes off of yourself don't put your eyes on yourself the sounding of the trumpet is to put such an awareness in our heart that he has become all things to us he has freely given us all things this is why that a person that's in need of the holy ghost you're not asking god for something that don't belong to you you're asking god for what belongs to you you're not in a stranger's house i mean if you came in my house probably you know you'd be polite and say bro sam i'd like to have a little bit of peanut butter i got a lot of that brother vivian i like peanut butter you could say brother sammy i'd like to have some peanut butter see you can ask me about that but what's different is is that when you know you're in a place you can go and get that peanut butter you're in a place where you can go not as a beggar not as a stranger brother samuel i really need healing you don't got to beg him for it that's right you know how much we pound it ain't how much we yell and then it's do we believe do we believe and if we believe we shall receive amen we've been called back to we've been called to an inheritance to possess all things that have been given to us as a believer in jesus christ so no matter what it is that if the enemy is trying to remember it you know this you've heard this not only it's been said across this platform whether it's been me or whatever other many other brothers has come across you and you've heard it other places too if you say the devil's telling me he's a liar just stop listening to him he might sound like he has a valid argument but he's a liar there's a greater voice than his voice he's a liar the blood proclaims freedom it proclaims liberty you've got a right to walk every day in your life with joy what do i do turn down turn his voice down and listen to god's voice have faith in what he has said concerning you and you'll find things that could trouble they'll be released they'll be released they'll be released be let go brother ram talks about that blood being shed and he said you know you're already free he said but many times he said people are still bound by creeds by what they think now i know throughout this building and no matter who will be streaming or any of us maybe you sat in the denominational church and maybe you didn't but god still works to break us free from our own thinking because where many times do we limit is in our own thoughts is that right but the word keeps proclaiming you're free you're free you're free is that right and it keeps proclaiming that to do what it's god moving to take our thinking we have to give that to him is that right we have to give that thinking to him because remember as we said here i think it was on thursday god don't bypass the mind and then go to the soul spoke the words original seed brother ram says you first agree with that word and you must accept it in the womb of your mind and it's the word that has life and he said then he said the word comes down into the soul and that brings new birth it's a word birth that's a real experience with god because a word birth it changes us from death unto life it brings about a life that now is lived by the word to where when the word comes across our pathway the desire within our life is when we're corrected be an unto me lord forgive me lord what is it it's that on the inside a desire to line up with the word amen let's pray heavenly father lord jesus you're you are the ever-present god lord declaring declaring to us the time the seas and the hour that we're living lord to rehearse it in our hearts and to declare to us lord god reminding us once again and lord perhaps there's some here this morning that lord they haven't heard that sound but there's a sounding of freedom that goes out to their life that lets them know that calls them to a place of surrender the holy spirit going with conviction lord to convict them of their wrong and to let them know there's a better way there's a better way there's a true way there's a right way life is present to release them lord i pray god if there would be one under the sound of my voice granted lord may they respond to that conviction of the holy spirit may they repent may they lay their life down like that slave that would be there in the field and he'd have to be working and working and working and he was under the voice of a master that master said do this he had to do it do this he had to do it do this even things he didn't want to do but the master was still making him do it but one day when they heard that sound they could lay down whatever tool whatever instrument whatever it was in their hand and they could walk from where they were and walk right back home what i pray this morning if there's one here or one streaming lord one that even might archive this i pray that god that it's you that's been set so evidently before us lord you that's been made so real to the heart because that's bring that conviction to draw him to that place to let him know the simplicity of surrender just surrender just just lay it down lay down the life completely and say god i'm coming home lord forgive me of my sins i want to be united with you i want to walk and enter in lord god to your presence i want to be united with you that life that is calling to me granted lord [Music] now i pray father for needs that are all

you [Music] that you would come and minister to that need minister lord to the heart behind that request lord god perhaps the need is for someone who's not even sitting here but lord we believe that the same holy spirit that's right here that's spoken to us through the word we believe dear god as sons and daughters of god that there's an authority that god that we can send the holy spirit out after him lord [Music] we can make lord acclaim and that the holy spirit would come and enforce that claim oh god i pray that you'll just move right now lord for each life lord whether lord it's healing of the body whether it's in their spirit i pray right now that god made you just move in such a special way and may we receive it lord may we welcome you may we invite your sounding to our life maybe god i pray right now that every voice of doubt and every voice of reasoning oh god may it just be cast down right now at the feet at the feet of jesus may it be every every voice lord that

hearts lord may it be a greater desire a greater yielding to say lord you're the one who has called me and brought me lord you're the one lord that has placed me lord in you now lord you're the same one who's maturing me lord let me just continue to yield to your presence surrendering to you lord all in the name of jesus christ amen and amen hallelujah oh hallelujah oh hallelujah glory be to god oh my i tell you just to realize where we're standing there there's nothing nothing too big for god that's just not a statement that's a reality there's no circumstance that's too great for god but just remember this every circumstance every situation is an opportunity for god to move the red sea wasn't great enough to stop jordan wasn't deep enough or flooded enough to stop him the lions weren't great enough to eat daniel the fire wasn't great enough to consume the hebrew children why because of god because of him so there's no circumstance even a circumstance that we know if thrown in the lion's den hey you're gone fire the man who threw him in the fire were consumed it was a situation that was greater than mortality could stand [Music] but god showed that there's no circumstance no situation no test no trial no obstacle that's too great for him [Music] so no matter what it is no matter what that need is i've given you scripture and we can go more and more and more but there's no obstacle nothing that's greater than god but samia i've got a need in my life right now why don't you go ahead and speak to that need speak to that obstacle that's in your life

surgeries two hip total total hip replacements two back surgeries that i can remember i think she had surgery on her sinuses and such we had two times she was in the hospital with kidney failure and chemical imbalance and suspend i think maybe like two weeks two to three weeks in the hospital with with that and uh one time in in icu with the aspiration pneumonia was uh was dead on the table and and they brought her back so was it just another fishing trip no it was for me it was just living proof we serve a god of restoration we serve a god of miracles so i just wanted to share that with you it's jesus christ the same yesterday amen today and forever and if we'll do that for a person just in the natural to have a body just it's something simple a little fishing trip what do you got on your heart today i mean brother samuel close that way and i i just i just like to reinforce that what what do you have you know on your mind on your heart you know god knows you know no matter what it

you're doing in all of our lives and lord the same god that let my mom walk back on that boat yesterday after so many years and so many trials and so many tests and surgeries lord is what you do in all of our lives lord there might be times when we're broken it might just be broken inside glory maybe it's broken emotionally or something our hearts broken for loved ones and different ones but lord you you promise that you will present to yourself a living a bride lord of perfect without spot or wrinkle and there's not going to be one person that's supposed to be there that's not going to be there not only that there's not going to be one thing inside of us lord you said you don't say a pure and spotless bride so we're not going to be presented to you with even one spot or one wrinkled
