[32:07] Mountains of Mercy
[32:14] zombies yes
[32:16] [Music]
[32:38] glory to God
[32:41] Hallelujah
[32:43] certainly not a fair trade
[32:46] for what we've received
[32:49] and what he what he took from us amen
[32:52] and he's the only one that could do that
[32:54] amen and I'm just so thankful to be a
[32:58] living testimony of What Not only he's
[33:00] done but what he's doing
[33:02] you know when we become Memorials of God
[33:05] we do not become stones that are just
[33:07] asphyxiated in one place but we are
[33:10] living memorials
[33:12] we are not we are not images that cannot
[33:15] hear nor speak nor see but to think of
[33:18] it brother REM tells us like this over
[33:20] and over in the message he says that you
[33:22] are God's image and you are God's ye and
[33:26] he says it like this in the message
[33:27] perseverance you are God's Idol but to
[33:30] recognize that it's not us just in one
[33:32] place but it's God's life being
[33:34] projected through you and I
[33:37] amen and I'm grateful to God that you
[33:40] know because those that have the idols
[33:42] they have to pack the idol they have to
[33:43] set the idol up and remember it was even
[33:46] when they took the ark the Philistines
[33:48] took the ark and they put it in the uh
[33:50] into the house of their God Dagon and
[33:54] Dagon had to Bow
[33:56] they found him on his face
[33:59] amen and I'm just grateful that it's not
[34:03] us packing Our God around but is God
[34:05] packing us around amen it's God he says
[34:08] I would live in you and I will walk in
[34:11] you and and move through our lives and
[34:13] that's a reality isn't it it's something
[34:15] that becomes more and more real and more
[34:17] precious and you know it just we see it
[34:19] it's God working and even a very simple
[34:22] very very simple way even some of the
[34:24] things that his brother Steve and I were
[34:26] talking about today we were just giving
[34:28] just speaking about the just the the
[34:30] person of Christ right here Among Us and
[34:33] moving in our lives and just how the
[34:35] Simplicity of things sometimes that we
[34:37] are even unaware of and we come back to
[34:41] it and you realize it was God all along
[34:46] and it's just you know without any time
[34:48] to give to that but yet you recognize it
[34:50] in in many situations that has just been
[34:53] the Lord and I I just believe that
[34:56] that's God's desire for us that we would
[34:58] move in that same way because it's not
[35:00] that we recognize that the third pool
[35:02] and these things it's not us working
[35:04] ourselves up into something
[35:06] but it's actually resting
[35:08] that's that's the real work of the Holy
[35:10] Spirit that's why he comes in the
[35:12] services the way he does that's why he
[35:14] works in our life daily is to bring rest
[35:16] to our lives you know how it is if we're
[35:20] frustrated about something of course
[35:21] nobody in here gets frustrated I know
[35:23] and you get anxious about something you
[35:25] know you know you're no good you might
[35:27] as well hang it up whatever you're doing
[35:28] while I'm fixing this wall hang it up if
[35:30] you're anxious you're frustrated hanging
[35:32] up you're not going to get nowhere you
[35:33] might as well go out take a drive go get
[35:35] a hamburger or something you're not
[35:36] going to do no good right but when when
[35:38] we're resting then you find that there
[35:41] are things that begin to happen and come
[35:43] together even in the natural
[35:45] how much greater in the spiritual
[35:47] amen I believe that with all my heart
[35:50] God's bringing us more and more even to
[35:51] that awareness within our lives that it
[35:53] is truly a rest it's us as brother Ram
[35:56] said it's us ceasing and it's God doing
[35:58] and so that's the thing that I believe
[36:00] tonight that as we've come together that
[36:03] there are things that God is going to
[36:05] even do tonight in our lives you may not
[36:07] feel you may not even see but there's
[36:10] things that are moving
[36:12] because if one grain of sand is moved
[36:15] it's a testimony the rest of the
[36:16] mountains on the way
[36:18] so there are things God is working even
[36:20] when we don't see it or feel it
[36:23] you know we appreciate those times but
[36:25] even when we don't God is working
[36:28] amen so we just want to be under the
[36:30] influence tonight of that amen so good
[36:32] to be in the house of the Lord it's good
[36:34] to have brother Stephen with us and
[36:36] maybe brother Alex if you can uh just
[36:38] look back there and just let him know
[36:39] we're ready
[36:40] and uh we're just uh thankful also to
[36:44] have uh brother Alexander here with us
[36:46] tonight and uh you know he was uh he had
[36:49] already mentioned that uh to me he was
[36:51] coming up and he wanted to come up and
[36:54] hear uh brother Stephen and so brother
[36:57] Alex has been over there in Uganda and
[36:59] so we're just glad to have him here
[37:01] brother Alexander he's a good friend of
[37:03] ours amen he certainly means a lot to us
[37:06] and we just so appreciate our brother
[37:08] and his family and uh but brother
[37:10] Stephen ibali comes to us from Uganda
[37:13] he's it's been about four about four a
[37:16] year five years now since he was here
[37:18] and uh brother Stephen I you know I've
[37:21] said it like this he uh it's not like he
[37:24] makes a large tract around everywhere
[37:26] but I you know I've said it like this
[37:29] when I talked to other brothers I said
[37:30] if he even I want him to preach for me
[37:32] but I said even if he didn't preach for
[37:34] me the fellowship
[37:36] I'm sitting under an oak tree
[37:38] I'm gleaning man God knows what we have
[37:41] need of
[37:42] but the do you know the ministry there
[37:44] are things that I told Brother Stephen
[37:45] from even years and years ago in early
[37:48] 2000 when he was coming we were
[37:50] fellowshipping on the opening of the
[37:51] seventh seal and things we were going
[37:53] through and you know it's just something
[37:54] as you see that all parts of the body
[37:56] God does not have one part that just has
[37:59] everything exclusively but God has
[38:01] everything to work together and that's
[38:03] how God has designed it God has made it
[38:05] so that we are not independent but we
[38:08] are interdependent
[38:11] and that's how God established the body
[38:13] it's an individual work but then we are
[38:15] in the we are interdependent and that's
[38:17] so it's so precious you know and so we
[38:19] appreciate brother Stephen and him
[38:21] taking time to be with us here and he's
[38:23] only in the states for a few weeks and
[38:25] so I I'll just say it like this before
[38:28] he ministers if we could have arranged
[38:31] this better and it's on my part uh we
[38:33] would have liked to just done even a
[38:35] Thursday and Friday and then brother
[38:36] Erickson could have had him on Sunday
[38:38] because the ministry how many of you
[38:41] remember brother Stephen being here
[38:42] before
[38:43] okay yeah all right just a few of you
[38:45] and I'll say what he said remember what
[38:47] he told us before he says you speak
[38:48] American I speak English
[38:53] is British so we just asked God to just
[38:57] prepare you know sometimes our you know
[38:59] we our words might sound different in
[39:01] their words but he's the same God that
[39:03] he came on the day of Pentecost the
[39:05] miracle was not in the speaking the
[39:07] miracle was in the hearing and even if
[39:09] you can perfectly understand even as you
[39:12] would understand me it still takes the
[39:15] Holy Spirit to loosen and open our ears
[39:17] and that's what we want tonight is that
[39:19] the Holy Spirit would come and just
[39:21] loosen our our understanding that we
[39:23] might receive from God tonight so
[39:25] whatever today has hold and whatever
[39:27] you're looking at tomorrow just lay it
[39:30] lay it and say God I come here tonight
[39:32] to receive from you because when you
[39:35] consider it God has the answer to
[39:38] address whatever that you are looking at
[39:40] and contemplating God already has the
[39:42] answer for it amen and so with that as
[39:46] we prepare to invite brother Stephen I
[39:47] want to say that it's brother
[39:49] Alexander's birthday
[39:51] you know he
[39:55] yeah
[39:57] and my guess was 60.
[40:00] so
[40:01] foreign
[40:03] but you don't look at Dave Beyond 60
[40:05] really
[40:07] you know brother Alexander just turned
[40:09] 40 so we say happy birthday brother
[40:11] Alexander
[40:15] and God bless you amen let's just let's
[40:18] sing that song Amen uh only believe as
[40:22] we turn the service here to brother
[40:23] Stephen and Stephen just take your
[40:25] Liberty brother you're at home
[40:28] we love you
[40:29] amen and just appreciate the word of God
[40:31] let's just open our hearts
[40:34] oh
[40:40] God
[40:44] [Music]
[41:10] all things
[41:12] [Music]
[41:19] Lord I did
[41:23] [Music]
[41:44] oh time
[41:47] [Music]
[41:55] always
[42:02] [Music]
[42:08] amen
[42:09] you may be seated
[42:12] I greet you in the precious name of our
[42:15] Lord Jesus Christ
[42:23] I thank God for
[42:26] the open door
[42:28] you know been here quite a few times
[42:32] when the senior Browning was still alive
[42:37] you know I've always been blessed being
[42:40] among your people
[42:42] amen
[42:43] um to us also nice to see brother
[42:46] Alexander he has been to my place
[42:49] so he will lead brother Samuel
[42:55] one of these days amen
[43:00] so as you had my name is Stephen I come
[43:03] from the eastern part of Africa
[43:06] and right now I want to give thanks to
[43:09] God
[43:10] because he has put the desire for the
[43:14] lost souls Upon Our Hearts
[43:17] and
[43:18] we are doing quite a bit of evangelism
[43:22] back home
[43:23] you know without you know
[43:27] ing we seem to think this message only
[43:32] belongs to us and our children
[43:35] yeah there are so many people who
[43:37] understand what are you doing
[43:40] but we are doing the best to get the
[43:43] Lost ship
[43:44] so that we get out of here
[43:46] so brother Alexander was asking me and I
[43:50] said come and see
[43:51] because what the Lord is doing is very
[43:54] hard for a man to perceive
[43:57] but out there people are hungry
[44:01] for the word
[44:02] they are really hungry
[44:04] you know they need something that they
[44:07] can hold on
[44:09] and so the Lord has given us the grace
[44:12] it's nothing to be proud of
[44:15] but it is something to thank God for
[44:19] amen so I appreciate brother Samuel
[44:23] letting me stand behind his desk here
[44:27] and I pray the Lord blesses him and
[44:30] bless the Sheep here bless his family
[44:34] amen so that he can be able to hold you
[44:39] know the fort
[44:40] to the coming of the Lord
[44:42] amen we just stand up and get into the
[44:46] scripture reading
[44:50] I turned
[44:52] to try to find my footing each time I
[44:56] come down here every preacher knows you
[44:59] got something put down
[45:02] but even how to approach it to begin
[45:05] with and my friend who has gone on to be
[45:09] with the Lord Brother Herod Hildebrandt
[45:12] used to say that the most difficult
[45:15] thing for him in the ministry is how to
[45:19] start and how to kill us
[45:22] I think brother Samia you agree with me
[45:24] you know how to start and how to close
[45:27] how to bring the thought into the minds
[45:30] of the people
[45:31] you see because once I fail on that then
[45:35] you are going to hear things that I'm
[45:37] saying but if I have the ability to give
[45:40] you the foundation of where I come from
[45:43] and where I want to go we shall be able
[45:46] to walk together tonight
[45:49] amen so just keep me in your prayers and
[45:54] that the Lord may speak to us
[45:56] we turn to the Book of Matthew chapter
[45:59] 20.
[46:01] is some bit of
[46:03] length reading
[46:05] but we shall read only the first verse
[46:10] and then we shall pray over the word
[46:14] Matthew 20 verse 1.
[46:17] he says for the kingdom of heaven
[46:20] is like can't a man that's a household
[46:23] which went out early in the morning to
[46:27] hire liberals into his Vineyard
[46:31] the kingdom of heaven
[46:34] not the kingdom of God
[46:36] less bad heads in order prayer precious
[46:40] Heavenly Father
[46:42] these are precious moments when
[46:45] your sons and daughters Lord are
[46:48] gathered in your presence
[46:50] further not for anything else but to
[46:54] hear your word
[46:56] sometimes Lord as ministers
[46:59] we find a difficult time to use the
[47:03] natural vocabulary to express
[47:05] Supernatural things
[47:07] but father I pray that you may come down
[47:11] give me the grace to take the word in
[47:14] such a way further that your children
[47:17] may be fed
[47:18] I commit the teaching of the word into
[47:21] your hands in Jesus name amen you may be
[47:26] seated
[47:27] so um
[47:30] tonight it's a privilege for me to be
[47:32] here
[47:33] as I already said but as we start
[47:36] getting into the word I just want to
[47:40] kind of follow with me
[47:42] because
[47:43] I tend to turn Junctions which I believe
[47:47] are very important in certain thoughts
[47:50] that I try to bring forth
[47:52] because I I don't just want to give you
[47:55] a fact I want to come with me and know
[47:59] how I get what I'm going to tell you and
[48:02] I trust that all of us together are so
[48:06] much studied in the message knowing the
[48:08] minister of brother Samuel that some of
[48:11] these things the Lord is going to just
[48:13] let them before us
[48:14] so now the scripture says for the
[48:17] Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a man
[48:21] that is a householder who went out early
[48:25] in the morning to higher liberals into
[48:27] his Vineyard okay so this Parable is
[48:31] speaking about the Kingdom of Heaven not
[48:35] the kingdom of God
[48:37] so the kingdom of God as the you know
[48:41] Lord Jesus already told us is within us
[48:45] yeah it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[48:48] but the Kingdom of Heaven comes by the
[48:52] stone cut without hands for us
[48:55] destroying the kingdoms of this world
[48:58] and when he comes he establishes a
[49:03] kingdom here on Earth that will be
[49:06] called the kingdom of heaven and he
[49:09] tells us each time we get into time of
[49:12] prayer we should always desire the
[49:14] coming of that Kingdom and I believe
[49:17] that every one of you is seeking to come
[49:20] out of this Dimension into that
[49:22] Dimension amen so he also taught us to
[49:26] pray daily as we just go before him and
[49:29] say Lord thy kingdom come amen we do not
[49:34] want the kingdoms of this world where
[49:36] the economies fail on different things
[49:38] and wicked men and some kind of one holy
[49:42] atmosphere around us you see every one
[49:45] of us desires to see the kingdom of
[49:48] heaven so now verse 2 says and when he
[49:52] had agreed with the laborers for a penny
[49:55] a day he sent them into his Vineyard
[49:58] and he went out about the third hour and
[50:02] so understanding I do in the marketplace
[50:05] you're not the word Idol in the
[50:08] marketplace the Lord wants us to be
[50:10] doing something all the time amen so an
[50:14] answer he didn't say that to them go ye
[50:17] also into the vineyard and whatsoever is
[50:20] right I'll give you and they went their
[50:23] way again he went out about the sixth
[50:26] hour and the ninth hour and did likewise
[50:30] and about the 11th hour he went out and
[50:35] found other stunning Idol and said unto
[50:39] them why stand ye hear all the day Idol
[50:43] and they say unto him because no man has
[50:46] hired us
[50:47] he has he says unto them go also into
[50:51] the vineyard and whatsoever is right
[50:54] that shall he receive so when even was
[50:59] come the Lord of The Vineyard says that
[51:02] to his Steward call the laborers and
[51:06] give them their higher beginning from
[51:08] the last until the first amen and when
[51:12] they came that we hired about the 11th
[51:16] Hour they received Every Man a penny
[51:20] so you know looking at the scripture
[51:23] that we have gone through I want to take
[51:26] a subject of the 11th Hour workers
[51:31] the 11th Hour workers all these men were
[51:37] hired for a uniform pay
[51:39] and you know everyone received a penny
[51:42] for the purpose because they were hired
[51:45] to attend at the bright tree Amen to the
[51:48] Harvest and the planet that they receive
[51:51] is eternal life amen so this means that
[51:55] what matters in our calling is not the
[51:59] volume of work we produce but how
[52:02] faithful we are to what the Lord has
[52:05] commissioned us to do
[52:07] amen is not how large your church is or
[52:10] how small your church is but how
[52:13] faithful to that colleague
[52:14] amen and brother Branham you know
[52:18] encourages us and says that best church
[52:21] that there was
[52:23] in the time of Paul was the Church of
[52:26] references and was only 12 people
[52:30] you know but that was the Church of
[52:32] adoption it was the example church at
[52:34] that time so and we talk about as we
[52:38] talk about the calling we don't just do
[52:42] the calling you know by way of the 540
[52:45] Ministry that the rest of them that are
[52:47] not in the ministry they do not have a
[52:49] calling upon their lives
[52:51] every one of us has got a purpose in the
[52:54] kingdom and God has a way he uses every
[52:57] one of us I remember brother Branham
[53:00] saying one thing that God can train a
[53:03] man for so many years only for a job
[53:06] that is going to do one day
[53:08] so now you find that all these other men
[53:11] who were standing Idol but you see they
[53:15] had the ability Amen to do what would be
[53:19] assigned to them so some came in the
[53:22] southern psalming the sixth seven some
[53:26] in the ninth hour but then there were
[53:28] those who came in the 11th Hour it seems
[53:32] like they got the skill only at work for
[53:35] one hour and then comes the kingdom of
[53:38] heaven
[53:39] okay so he says this I think we need to
[53:43] take this quote from the message
[53:45] influence he says now we find out though
[53:49] a good man blessed of God but if God
[53:52] blesses you stay in the category that
[53:55] God has called you in if it's a
[53:58] housewife remain housewife if it is a
[54:01] businessman in that business reflecting
[54:04] God and whatsoever God has called you to
[54:07] let it be that because he wants you to
[54:11] be a real housewife to reflect your
[54:14] influence upon another person that would
[54:17] want to be a good housewife if you are a
[54:20] good businessman let your life so be
[54:24] that it will reflect Jesus Christ in
[54:27] your business with honesty and integrity
[54:30] and with things that really mean
[54:32] something because somebody is watching
[54:36] your life you know we were just kind of
[54:40] having fellowship with brother Samuel
[54:42] and when you look at the armor of the
[54:45] Lord you see the gospel was given to the
[54:48] feet
[54:49] your feet showed with the gospel peace
[54:53] it was not given to the mouth actually
[54:56] the true gospel is the work of Our Lives
[55:00] so in whatsoever category you are the
[55:04] prophet says that you have got a
[55:07] responsibility Amen to shine Christ out
[55:11] and you are really shining him out not
[55:14] with the message of Luther not with the
[55:16] message of Wesley but the message of
[55:19] this hour you know that's what we need
[55:22] to reflect it's not just a matter of
[55:24] saying Jesus saves it's not a matter of
[55:27] just going around with Holiness I tell
[55:30] people that many times the thing that
[55:33] God desired throughout the ages is
[55:35] always Holiness but in the midst of
[55:38] Holiness there was always a message
[55:40] which was given
[55:42] amen yeah you know in the minister the
[55:46] Holiness there is always a message and
[55:49] so when we walk we don't walk the light
[55:52] of Luther we don't walk the light of
[55:55] Wesley we walk the light of this hour in
[55:58] the businessman or Bible teacher all a
[56:02] good parent whatsoever we are we are
[56:05] called to reflects Jesus Christ in a way
[56:09] to reflect him in the 11th Hour
[56:13] amen because somebody is watching your
[56:16] life you're influencing somebody God has
[56:19] to have the Real Housewife goddess of
[56:21] the real Teenage in school God has to
[56:24] have a real Minister a real businessman
[56:27] somebody that will reflect him because
[56:30] there they see in you Christ no matter
[56:34] what the rest of the world has got to do
[56:36] that has nothing to do with you amen so
[56:41] whatsoever office the Lord allows you to
[56:44] be in you are called and meant to be a
[56:48] steward of the definition of that office
[56:51] amen the definition of the housewife the
[56:55] definition as a businessman the
[56:57] definition as a past Minister whatsoever
[57:00] we are we are called to be stewards
[57:04] Amen to this mystery that we have been
[57:07] called to and then in First Corinthians
[57:10] chapter 4 verse 2 he says moreover is
[57:13] required in stewards that a man be found
[57:16] faithful
[57:18] amen a man be found faithful wherever
[57:21] God has blessed him so this stewardship
[57:24] is not monetary as we understand the
[57:27] stewardship sometimes but rather one's
[57:30] faithfulness to the mysteries of God in
[57:33] the area of his calling
[57:34] amen so he looks for faithful and wise
[57:39] stewards
[57:41] praise the Lord you're not there so wise
[57:45] and faithful Steward to the definition
[57:48] of the position in Christ where God is
[57:52] blessing them amen you know and he shall
[57:55] make them rule of his household to give
[57:58] their portion of meat in the season amen
[58:03] and in the commission the reward we
[58:07] praise the Lord you know it's just
[58:09] always the same whether you've been a
[58:12] you know a given five talents so you've
[58:15] been given two talents the reward is
[58:18] always the same amen there's no one
[58:21] going to get more or less it's always
[58:24] one penny and in that because God is
[58:28] only rewarding our faithfulness in the
[58:31] tellers that he has given to us he will
[58:34] say Well done good and faithful servant
[58:37] thou has been Faithful over a few things
[58:40] I'll make you ruler over many things
[58:42] that's the same thing he taught on the
[58:45] 105 and the same reward is given to the
[58:48] one of two now through the seven Church
[58:51] ages we have heard seven word Messengers
[58:54] all of them were given different
[58:57] assignments depending on the nature of
[59:00] the age where they were working
[59:02] amen so I want us to view these seven
[59:06] word Messengers as the I mean through
[59:10] the seven Church ages as the workers
[59:13] that were hired to Tender the bright
[59:16] tree
[59:18] okay because the master finds them calls
[59:21] them he says come and work he finds Paul
[59:24] he says come and walk he finds Iranians
[59:26] come and walk he's calling all this men
[59:29] and is calling them to the vineyard but
[59:33] then when God calls this man the mystery
[59:36] that He blesses in them gives them men
[59:39] that are going to be faithful with the
[59:42] message of that age
[59:44] so these men share of the anointing
[59:47] together with the messenger and the
[59:49] purpose is returned at the bright tree
[59:52] that everyone where he is you know the
[59:56] Lord gives him exactly the same sword of
[59:59] the spirit amen to guard the they mean
[1:00:02] the Bright Tree like he did give to the
[1:00:04] cherubims so our purpose the work that
[1:00:08] we walk amen should be such a way that
[1:00:12] we are careful about what we've been
[1:00:16] called to do to Tender to Divine I mean
[1:00:19] to the bright dream the prophet says
[1:00:22] Jesus said the man went out and worked
[1:00:25] and worked and another man went out in
[1:00:28] another hour and he works another man
[1:00:32] went out and worked and the one man went
[1:00:34] out at the 11th hour and when he stopped
[1:00:38] at the 11th hour he gave every one of
[1:00:41] them the same person
[1:00:44] then brother Branham brings in the
[1:00:47] thought of the seven Messengers being
[1:00:50] those men that are being called in he
[1:00:53] says Martin Luther that worked walked
[1:00:57] under Luther's dispensation and died in
[1:01:00] Grace other shouting methods you know so
[1:01:04] he goes on and goes on and goes on all
[1:01:07] these 70 men here they accorded to
[1:01:09] Tender come and work amen so when God
[1:01:13] calls us into Divine he has got a
[1:01:16] responsibility for everyone of us so
[1:01:20] when we come down here we need to say
[1:01:22] Lord what would you want me to do and
[1:01:25] when he takes you through the season of
[1:01:27] your sanctification and it takes you to
[1:01:30] the altar you need to be like Isaiah
[1:01:32] when he says whom shall I send
[1:01:36] you know you need to come out and says
[1:01:38] here I am I've received the
[1:01:40] sanctification I've been through the
[1:01:42] teaching of the one I'm ready to go he
[1:01:46] says he found them they were loitering
[1:01:48] and where I know
[1:01:49] amen so all these seven Messengers had
[1:01:53] to be faithful to the message of their
[1:01:56] season so that they could post
[1:01:58] Overcomers that would seed in the next
[1:02:01] stage
[1:02:03] are you together with me amen because he
[1:02:07] says to him that overcometh will I give
[1:02:10] to eat of the tree of life which is in
[1:02:12] the midst of the garden which means that
[1:02:15] when they labored in this age amen the
[1:02:19] reward was not enjoyed in that same age
[1:02:22] it was enjoyed in the second age
[1:02:25] that came after the age where they
[1:02:28] levered so now every Minister every
[1:02:31] messenger had to be faithful because he
[1:02:35] had to send Overcomers and this
[1:02:38] Overcomers with the remnant that were
[1:02:41] seeding the age that was going to come
[1:02:43] they become Seeds of Life
[1:02:46] amen so The Messengers were in the right
[1:02:50] hand of authority and they were drawing
[1:02:53] special anointing as privileges on
[1:02:56] return they would pass the same
[1:02:59] anointing to those who were faithful to
[1:03:02] the message of the day
[1:03:04] you know when brother Branham is talking
[1:03:07] about the Seven Stars in the right hand
[1:03:10] you should see yourself exactly in the
[1:03:13] right time because the same anointing
[1:03:15] that the messenger had when it comes
[1:03:18] down to minister it places the people
[1:03:21] into the right hand
[1:03:23] Amen brother Branham says that in
[1:03:26] patma's Vision he says and this Comfort
[1:03:29] is not to the seventh Church age
[1:03:31] Messengers only every True Believer is
[1:03:34] in the hand of God and he can grow from
[1:03:37] his love and power and receive the full
[1:03:40] benefit of all that God is to the
[1:03:43] believer what gives the messenger and
[1:03:46] How He blesses and uses the messenger is
[1:03:50] an example to all believers of his
[1:03:53] goodness and care to all members of his
[1:03:56] body
[1:03:58] that's how God has walked through the
[1:04:00] edges that in every age they've been
[1:04:04] Sons and Daughters of God who have been
[1:04:07] faithful to the message that has been
[1:04:10] given unto them and as they grow they
[1:04:14] grow towards the hardship of their their
[1:04:16] age
[1:04:17] you see what I'm talking about they grow
[1:04:20] towards the Friendship of their age and
[1:04:24] the headship could have been one of
[1:04:26] those seven spirits in Paul maybe in
[1:04:29] Iranians maybe in Martin but they always
[1:04:32] grow towards that and brother Branham
[1:04:35] says that this uh Rock Box you know has
[1:04:40] always been there it was upon every age
[1:04:43] and it was kept going up kept going up
[1:04:46] and as it was going up it was like
[1:04:48] imaginary pulling out the mature one of
[1:04:51] the earth to bring them to a level where
[1:04:54] he could be able to cap them
[1:04:58] okay now so you are not born in this
[1:05:01] light sometimes we say I wish I was in
[1:05:05] the days of Luther or if I was in the
[1:05:08] days of Wesley but this is our season
[1:05:12] amen and in this season we must fight a
[1:05:16] good fight
[1:05:17] to be faithful to the calling that God
[1:05:20] has given to us in this age amen all
[1:05:24] these seven Messengers came in their
[1:05:26] season to Tender the bright tree
[1:05:30] amen every one of them had his
[1:05:33] assignment every one of them had his
[1:05:36] message they kept away the bags amen
[1:05:40] that could come and maybe destroy the
[1:05:43] fruit eater whether you know the the
[1:05:45] leaves so you know they kept the Bright
[1:05:48] Tree watered and you know they manure
[1:05:52] the train they gave the the bright tree
[1:05:55] food induces
[1:05:58] amen because as we grow the principle of
[1:06:03] it is like the church it grows
[1:06:06] there was a message for the church and
[1:06:10] that every season and that was their
[1:06:12] food in the season
[1:06:14] amen so even we as we are growing as
[1:06:19] Christians you know the Holy Spirit
[1:06:22] knows how to provide food inducism
[1:06:26] we come to the same church and we are
[1:06:29] all under this Minister and we listen to
[1:06:32] the same message but as the holy spirit
[1:06:35] is speaking to us everybody is receiving
[1:06:39] food in his season
[1:06:43] depending at the level of maturity you
[1:06:46] see I'm a pastor back at home and after
[1:06:49] I preached and minister to the people
[1:06:51] everybody testifies different
[1:06:54] because out of it they are receiving
[1:06:57] food in their deuces
[1:06:58] it's like the same principle of the
[1:07:01] seven chair changes all of these Church
[1:07:03] changes were under one Minister and the
[1:07:06] minister was joined the apostle
[1:07:08] but you know all these seven churches
[1:07:11] there are different challenges had
[1:07:13] different victories and yet they were
[1:07:15] feeding from the same minister
[1:07:18] you see there is a way we need to be
[1:07:22] priests in the house of God that we may
[1:07:25] have the ability to access the throne
[1:07:29] amen and then God begins to feed us you
[1:07:33] know so that you know we just keep
[1:07:35] growing the same way the 70 churches
[1:07:38] just grows and then brother Branham says
[1:07:41] the same way he brings up a church age
[1:07:43] is the same way brings up individuals
[1:07:47] amen because it has to be that life
[1:07:50] growing in US
[1:07:51] the same life that kept going through
[1:07:54] the edges must take an opportunity and
[1:07:57] grow through the life of an individual
[1:08:00] so God gave these Messengers the same
[1:08:03] flaming sword which turns every way that
[1:08:07] he had given the cherubims to keep the
[1:08:10] way of the Tree of Life
[1:08:13] are you together with me so the
[1:08:15] cherubims were all around this tree and
[1:08:18] the Heart of flaming sword what were
[1:08:22] they doing
[1:08:23] they were keeping the way of the Tree of
[1:08:27] Life
[1:08:28] and yet we know the tree of life is the
[1:08:32] Lord Jesus Christ amen amen and today we
[1:08:36] know that he has been embodied in the
[1:08:39] bright body
[1:08:40] and then he gives anointed men through
[1:08:44] the seven churches and they are faithful
[1:08:47] helpers the kind of swore to keep the
[1:08:50] weight of the Tree of Life to guide The
[1:08:53] Life of Christ that you are seated in
[1:08:56] the body of the church
[1:08:58] amen so we have always received of the
[1:09:02] same anointing as brother Branham says
[1:09:05] this way he uses the messenger and the
[1:09:07] Earth is an example of his goodness
[1:09:10] towards us amen you know it's just kind
[1:09:14] of coming and tripping in here and
[1:09:16] tripping in here you see that's why all
[1:09:20] that brother Branham was supposed to do
[1:09:22] was to reveal Christ to us
[1:09:26] that what he saw we may be able to see
[1:09:32] are you together with me amen so that's
[1:09:35] why in Revelation chapter 10 amen after
[1:09:39] the seals were revealed and you know
[1:09:43] Revelation 10 7 the lutherans of the
[1:09:46] world were completely you know uh broken
[1:09:49] and the Word was no longer a mystery but
[1:09:53] the word became Christ revealed unto us
[1:09:56] when he comes down a little lower after
[1:09:59] the word has worked upon us he says go
[1:10:03] to the angel who stands on the land and
[1:10:05] the sea
[1:10:07] go to the same Source where the Prophet
[1:10:09] went because he brought the introduction
[1:10:12] of Christ was
[1:10:14] together with him amen some people think
[1:10:18] we need to keep going back to Revelation
[1:10:20] 10 7 but go to the angel the same angel
[1:10:24] that anointed Revelation 10 7 is the
[1:10:28] same angel that we need to go to
[1:10:31] because the way he used him is an
[1:10:34] example of his goodness towards us that
[1:10:38] we are also supposed to grow into the
[1:10:41] adoption because he has given us the
[1:10:43] example seed Christ in the son of
[1:10:46] magnesium
[1:10:47] amen so uh Revelation chapter 4 verse 6
[1:10:53] amen see what I'm saying here that we
[1:10:57] have received the same anointing amen
[1:10:59] that's what the messenger has received
[1:11:02] and they kept passing them down to the
[1:11:05] faithful Believers in every age
[1:11:08] amen and so when Malachi 4 was doing his
[1:11:13] work when he was finishing out
[1:11:17] you know when he begins to sound rather
[1:11:19] amen he calls the bright body out of
[1:11:24] organization and he says come up here
[1:11:29] so John ascends Beyond
[1:11:32] Church
[1:11:34] into the region of Bride
[1:11:37] and then we know that the wedding
[1:11:41] is done here but the supper is done up
[1:11:45] there
[1:11:47] so the calling out was to help us come
[1:11:51] into an invisible Union with the
[1:11:55] headstone
[1:11:55] [Applause]
[1:11:57] so come up hither what are we coming to
[1:12:00] we are coming before a throne
[1:12:04] we are coming before our presence we are
[1:12:07] coming before the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:12:09] himself that's why we understand that he
[1:12:13] had to come down on the sunset Mountain
[1:12:16] why simply because of one thing that
[1:12:20] they had to come a union
[1:12:23] amen so he says in Revelation chapter 4
[1:12:27] verse 6 I'm trying to piece up quite a
[1:12:30] few things and Before the Throne there
[1:12:33] was a sea of glass like counter-christa
[1:12:36] and in the midst of the throne and round
[1:12:38] above the throne where four beasts full
[1:12:41] of eyes before and behind and the first
[1:12:45] Beast was like a lion and the second
[1:12:47] piece was the Leica calf and the third
[1:12:50] Beast had a faces of a man and the
[1:12:53] fourth Beast was like a flying eagle
[1:12:57] amen so we see here that The Messengers
[1:13:01] didn't go out to watch over the bright
[1:13:04] tree with enticing words of man's Wisdom
[1:13:10] but they went into the demonstration of
[1:13:13] spirit and Power
[1:13:16] are you together with me you know and
[1:13:19] the pattern of it now
[1:13:22] is this
[1:13:24] that when the Lord was working with a
[1:13:29] particular season of The Seven Church
[1:13:31] ages
[1:13:32] he was sending a form of anointing down
[1:13:39] and we really see
[1:13:40] that when the seals were opening because
[1:13:45] somebody asked me you know that when I
[1:13:49] read the Seven Seals all I see is horse
[1:13:52] riders
[1:13:53] I said wait a minute
[1:13:56] you wouldn't see the horse rider unless
[1:13:59] there was one who was saying come and
[1:14:01] see
[1:14:05] you see because brother Branham says
[1:14:08] that Christ was the seals that was
[1:14:10] revealed
[1:14:11] but when people started the seals all
[1:14:15] that they see is arthritis
[1:14:18] but you see this is the principle of it
[1:14:20] that when the enemy comes up as a flag
[1:14:24] it is on God's Own responsibility to
[1:14:28] raise the standard
[1:14:30] so now the standard was not anointing
[1:14:34] that was among the people to make them
[1:14:38] aware even before the enemy would come
[1:14:40] and attack come and see come and see so
[1:14:45] the pattern here is that if you are
[1:14:48] Faithfully told the anointing of God to
[1:14:51] the messenger backs you up
[1:14:56] amen and this anointing is the Ford
[1:15:01] anointing through the seven churches
[1:15:04] we saw this anointing as a lion as a nox
[1:15:08] anointing and as a man anointing and as
[1:15:11] an ego anointing you know all these
[1:15:14] anointings are not literal the animals
[1:15:17] per se but they are literally using uh
[1:15:22] the kind of bees that Define the way the
[1:15:26] anointing worked in that seal
[1:15:30] you know just like a Christ would be
[1:15:33] called the Lamb of God
[1:15:35] but he was not that animal but the
[1:15:39] purpose of his coming and how he would
[1:15:41] perform his Redemption could only be
[1:15:44] compared to that lamp
[1:15:46] and then that's where Christ will be the
[1:15:48] Lamb of God so now we've been running
[1:15:51] through the seven Church edges by these
[1:15:54] four different anointings amen so
[1:15:58] Ephesus
[1:16:00] they share in the lion anointing come
[1:16:03] and see
[1:16:05] and then you're not the defense by the
[1:16:08] word against the Antichrist you know
[1:16:12] it was
[1:16:14] you know the lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:16:17] the word
[1:16:19] the king
[1:16:21] stands out in the face of his bride so
[1:16:25] the anointing of the age again of the
[1:16:28] attire was under the ox anointing okay
[1:16:32] it was the decades the light of the word
[1:16:36] had been extinguished it was Darkness
[1:16:39] the pressure of the Dark Ages was either
[1:16:42] Bend or be broken bow or die it was the
[1:16:45] Inquisition of the power of the Empire
[1:16:48] backing up a satanic worship brother
[1:16:51] Branham says and then God stepped up the
[1:16:56] anointing again
[1:16:58] at a higher level
[1:17:00] and then took the child to the anointing
[1:17:03] of a man anointing so the anointing
[1:17:07] opened by Luther
[1:17:09] 1995 reasons why Rome was wrong
[1:17:14] then declare that the judge shall live
[1:17:17] by faith
[1:17:18] and then the same anointing took an
[1:17:20] octave higher amen you know then
[1:17:25] you know the the church was able to come
[1:17:29] into the age
[1:17:35] sometimes when we speak about the age of
[1:17:38] the Flying Eagle there is a way that we
[1:17:42] really think that Pentecost was in this
[1:17:45] age too
[1:17:47] but platypus was part of the Reformation
[1:17:51] right
[1:17:53] are you together with me because that's
[1:17:56] your this year come out of 100 people
[1:18:01] the anointing of the Flying Eagle could
[1:18:04] only be in the bright age amen
[1:18:13] picked up those Force and now here we
[1:18:17] are in this last eight and we know that
[1:18:20] it has had two phases
[1:18:21] I'm trying to come up and share with oh
[1:18:25] praise the Lord amen
[1:18:29] then I get this off man oh
[1:18:34] What's Happening Here
[1:18:36] praise the Lord
[1:18:37] you see uh I want us to see that this
[1:18:43] Edge where we are it had to face the
[1:18:46] street
[1:18:47] there was a come out
[1:18:49] and then there is that going
[1:18:53] a part of the ministry oh brother
[1:18:55] Branham was the part of the calling out
[1:19:00] amen and again another part
[1:19:03] is about the going in
[1:19:05] helping us to cross the Jordan and
[1:19:09] become into our position
[1:19:12] and come into adoption it's come up
[1:19:16] either come out of our my people and I
[1:19:19] will show you things
[1:19:23] are you together with me come out of the
[1:19:27] suffered stick
[1:19:29] yeah
[1:19:32] and we come over at a higher level
[1:19:35] where specific
[1:19:37] amen didn't only have a suffered stick
[1:19:42] but he has a prophetic anointing to
[1:19:45] himself
[1:19:47] so we come up now into this kind of age
[1:19:51] let me see here what brother Branham
[1:19:54] tells us and father today we stand here
[1:19:57] by your grace and it's not because that
[1:20:00] is a special people but it's because
[1:20:03] just like the day of the lion or ox or
[1:20:07] the man is the ego time is the anointing
[1:20:10] of the hour it's the time that we are
[1:20:13] living in
[1:20:15] so is now identifies the age where the
[1:20:20] message now separates the people out of
[1:20:23] organization he is calling it the ego
[1:20:26] time the anointing of the hour
[1:20:31] is come and see
[1:20:36] come up either
[1:20:38] and I'll show you things that are going
[1:20:40] to be hereafter
[1:20:42] so he's now calling you into prophetic
[1:20:45] Edge
[1:20:46] and in 1964 then brother Branham
[1:20:50] identified this hour as the hour of the
[1:20:55] 11th Hour
[1:20:59] he says now the seventh Angels message
[1:21:02] is to open the mystery of the seals
[1:21:07] calling the 11th Hour Gentile workers to
[1:21:12] receive the same pay that's the first
[1:21:15] our workers got
[1:21:18] so we come all the way now so we come to
[1:21:22] the special time of the 11th Hour
[1:21:27] he says he so perfectly how the first
[1:21:31] our Messengers with the word with the
[1:21:34] gospel with the truth they came in at
[1:21:37] that day of Pentecost then there was a
[1:21:41] decade that blocked them out then that
[1:21:45] middle of the day Luther Wesley them
[1:21:48] came in and then there is to be an
[1:21:52] evening time message to receive the same
[1:21:57] thing that they did at the beginning
[1:22:01] so who are we here
[1:22:04] we are the 11th our workers
[1:22:08] amen we've not come in late but this is
[1:22:12] our season
[1:22:15] amen sometimes there is a feeling I wish
[1:22:19] I was there in the days before
[1:22:21] but it's more glorious now than it was
[1:22:25] there
[1:22:26] because there was the alpha but right
[1:22:29] now we've got alphanometer amen
[1:22:33] amen the two anointings is now linked up
[1:22:38] together we have the anointing of the
[1:22:40] 11th amen we shouldn't think we were
[1:22:44] born late this is our age and we need to
[1:22:47] take in the right anointing of the edge
[1:22:51] friends the reason why the people fail
[1:22:54] is when they coming down here we are in
[1:22:58] the Harvest but then the people go into
[1:23:01] the watering age
[1:23:03] okay
[1:23:06] are you together with me much as Paul
[1:23:10] listen now I'm trying to bring out this
[1:23:13] principle hope it becomes more clear
[1:23:16] much as Paul was born out of the
[1:23:19] discipleship season yet when he came he
[1:23:23] was in season
[1:23:27] he says in First Corinthians 15 4 he
[1:23:31] says and that he was buried and that he
[1:23:35] was again the third according to the
[1:23:37] scriptures and that he was seen of see
[1:23:40] first then of the twelve and that he was
[1:23:43] sinner of about 500 Brethren at once of
[1:23:47] whom the great apart remained unto this
[1:23:51] present day but some have fallen Asylum
[1:23:54] and after that he was seen of James then
[1:23:58] of all the apostles unless of all he was
[1:24:03] seen of me also as one that was born out
[1:24:08] of due time
[1:24:11] [Music]
[1:24:12] are you together with him you know
[1:24:14] because this rock box has been coming
[1:24:18] and growing together with the church
[1:24:20] like a dad such a magnetic anointing
[1:24:24] upon it that once it was hanging over
[1:24:27] the growth and the growing pyramid he
[1:24:30] had the ability to pull those that were
[1:24:33] this I mean predestinated for the next
[1:24:36] age he kept going out he kept going up
[1:24:39] when there was nothing more to pull he
[1:24:42] decided to see as a Capstone aboard the
[1:24:46] mature age
[1:24:48] amen so now let's take the prince for
[1:24:53] that the late bus we're also still in
[1:24:56] season
[1:24:57] they were just 11 hour workers for their

[1:29:05] about how people should be this and how
[1:29:09] people should do that and how people
[1:29:11] should have this and no this is not your

[1:29:27] amen the principles that the true bride
[1:29:31] of Christ was in the mind of God
[1:29:34] eternally do not express until each came
[1:29:38] forth in the designated season
[1:29:41] amen so this is your season To Shine the
[1:29:46] Light of Life to the world
[1:29:50] each member came forth as each member
[1:29:54] came forth brother Branham says it
[1:29:57] became expressed and took his position
[1:29:59] in the body
[1:30:01] not another man's place no sir but took
[1:30:05] his position in the body in the right
[1:30:08] season
[1:30:11] praise God so this should be known that
[1:30:17] we serve a God who works in the fullness
[1:30:20] of time
[1:30:21] he will never take you to Ali and he'll
[1:30:25] never take you in too late
[1:30:27] when the Lord calls you in that's your
[1:30:31] time that's your season and that's where
[1:30:34] your anointing is
[1:30:38] amen now Galatians 4 4 but when the
[1:30:43] fullness of time was come
[1:30:47] God sent forth his son made of a woman
[1:30:51] under the law
[1:30:54] he could not come in the days of
[1:30:56] Jeremiah not in the days of Ezekiel but
[1:31:01] in the fullness of time
[1:31:04] he goes to the marketplace and he picks
[1:31:07] out this one and picks out Columba and
[1:31:10] picks out to Martin and picks out Wesley
[1:31:14] is as true to the seven Church ages as
[1:31:19] it is true to every one of us in a local
[1:31:22] church
[1:31:25] amen when the fullness of time is come
[1:31:29] Genesis 3 15 count the seed of the woman
[1:31:34] Ephesians 1 10 that in the disposition
[1:31:38] of the fullness of time he might gather
[1:31:42] together anyone all things in Christ
[1:31:44] both which are in heaven and which are
[1:31:47] on Earth
[1:31:49] even in him it's always
[1:31:52] the fullness of time
[1:31:55] he works with the fullness of time
[1:32:00] there's this famous quote here that
[1:32:03] brother Branham uses it says the time
[1:32:06] was not at hard previously
[1:32:09] in the wisdom and economy of God this
[1:32:13] might the revelation
[1:32:15] though fully known to God could not come
[1:32:19] forth
[1:32:22] it had to be the fullness of time
[1:32:26] it could not come in the times of Wesley
[1:32:30] it had to come in the eyes
[1:32:34] where we had the ability to see
[1:32:41] praise the Lord
[1:32:43] he says thus we immediately learn a
[1:32:46] principle the revelation of God for each
[1:32:49] age can come in the age only and a
[1:32:54] specific time look at the history of
[1:32:57] Israel the revelation of God Moses came
[1:33:00] only to a specific time of history and
[1:33:04] even more specifically it come as the
[1:33:07] people cried under God Jesus himself
[1:33:09] come at the fullness of time he being
[1:33:13] the complete revelation of the godhead
[1:33:15] and in this age the revelation of God
[1:33:19] will come in due time it will not falter
[1:33:23] neither will it be premature think on
[1:33:26] this and heed it well for we are in the
[1:33:31] end time today
[1:33:35] what part of the Bible are we
[1:33:39] what chapter are we
[1:33:42] we are not in Revelation chapter one
[1:33:44] brother
[1:33:47] praise the lord we are the age that is
[1:33:52] presented Before the Throne
[1:33:55] John stood out there and right there is
[1:33:59] when things started to change for John
[1:34:04] amen so stand there and watch for your
[1:34:07] season because you were raised for a
[1:34:10] purpose in this season
[1:34:12] the message I mean the season
[1:34:17] under the gift must agree
[1:34:21] are you together with me
[1:34:23] the season and the gift must agree
[1:34:30] that's why this is not luda's age
[1:34:34] the gift and the season Mustang
[1:34:39] I'll give you a little more examples
[1:34:42] when the feast turns heard that they had
[1:34:45] anointed David King over Israel all the
[1:34:48] few things came to seek David
[1:34:52] and definitely acquired of the Lord
[1:34:54] saying shall I go up to the fifth times
[1:34:56] will you deliver them to my hands
[1:35:00] God pointed him to a season
[1:35:05] not that he was not able enough then but
[1:35:10] because he works by the fullness of time
[1:35:16] God taught him
[1:35:19] and let it be when thou hears the sound
[1:35:23] of going in stops of the marble trees
[1:35:26] that thing Thou shalt be step by soul
[1:35:30] for them shall the Lord God out there
[1:35:33] before thee to Smite the host of the
[1:35:36] fields
[1:35:42] you see time limits us he is going now
[1:35:45] to pray for the people
[1:35:47] and then he gets into place he has
[1:35:50] already seen a vision is until this and
[1:35:53] this and this is in place
[1:35:55] and result they are talking and talking
[1:35:58] and talking because they are seeing a
[1:36:00] vision and when he sees this Lord is in
[1:36:03] her position and this is in that
[1:36:05] position in the fullness of time
[1:36:10] yes okay
[1:36:12] God's Victor for us works in the right
[1:36:16] season
[1:36:18] you were designated to overcome but now
[1:36:24] regardless of how dark the age has been
[1:36:28] regardless of what comes out of hell
[1:36:32] because the leads off of Hell in this
[1:36:34] age
[1:36:35] brother you are destined
[1:36:41] amen
[1:36:43] [Music]
[1:36:47] it's closed my womb God has closed my
[1:36:50] womb but God was waiting for the races
[1:36:55] because Zachary and his wife Elizabeth
[1:36:58] were both righteous before God walking
[1:37:01] in all the Commandments and ordinances
[1:37:03] of God blameless
[1:37:07] but God works in the fullness of time
[1:37:12] they had no child because the Elizabeth
[1:37:14] was buried and they were both
[1:37:17] well-stricken in the ass amen could be
[1:37:21] in their thinking they thought they
[1:37:24] would never have a child but yet before
[1:37:27] God he was waiting for the season
[1:37:32] amen so the season had to link Mary's
[1:37:36] season because John needed a virgin born
[1:37:41] son to be his message
[1:37:43] [Applause]
[1:37:46] you see the word got the wax things so
[1:37:49] we got to be children of this age
[1:37:51] through the Preakness of the word of God
[1:37:54] to bring forth a child of this age the
[1:37:58] seed child Christ
[1:38:00] this is the season of the adoption of
[1:38:04] the sons of God
[1:38:07] amen and you know that anointing is ripe
[1:38:12] to produce that
[1:38:14] you are not out of season this is your
[1:38:17] season to manifest his life
[1:38:21] that's picture of a perfect man
[1:38:24] and while we stand here we can say this
[1:38:27] day this scripture is
[1:38:31] [Applause]
[1:38:38] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:38:42] Hallelujah in the Old Testament the
[1:38:45] people were living that prophecy but the
[1:38:48] season I did not come
[1:38:50] and when Jesus came he steps in the
[1:38:54] fullness of time and he says so that it
[1:38:57] shall be fulfilled that was written by
[1:39:00] light I mean uh Jeremiah the prophet so
[1:39:04] that it can be fulfilled that was spoken
[1:39:06] by a lie I mean by Isaiah
[1:39:10] because the season had come and then
[1:39:14] when we begin to see the promise of this
[1:39:19] hour and recognizing the time and by
[1:39:22] faith knowing you have been cold then
[1:39:26] that's where your purpose for the Earth
[1:39:28] is
[1:39:31] amen so we are living in the constant
[1:39:34] age the display of maturity
[1:39:38] praise God
[1:39:40] amen God is looking for sons that are
[1:39:45] going to reflect him because this is
[1:39:47] what this age requires
[1:39:50] amen and now he promised that the
[1:39:53] Mysteries that was hid in those churches
[1:39:56] would be revealed at the end of time and
[1:39:59] he lets us know now we are at the end
[1:40:03] time we are here now
[1:40:07] [Music]
[1:40:09] so when we go into the word what do we
[1:40:12] see
[1:40:13] we become students with word and then as
[1:40:16] we become students of the work line upon
[1:40:19] line line upon line the anointing keeps
[1:40:22] coming
[1:40:23] and then it strikes at a certain point
[1:40:26] and then Daniel Rises and he says this
[1:40:30] day this scriptures fulfilled seventh
[1:40:33] prayers is over we must come out of
[1:40:35] captivity
[1:40:37] in the fullness of time we begin to ask
[1:40:40] Lord what are we going to be what have
[1:40:43] we assigned for us what are we supposed
[1:40:45] to do as children of god let's go to the
[1:40:47] promise the message of the hour nobody
[1:40:50] should tell you who you should be you
[1:40:53] should go in the message of the hour
[1:40:56] discover who you are in the word of God
[1:41:00] then stand up and call for the anointing
[1:41:03] because we are living in the fullness of
[1:41:06] time
[1:41:09] Hallelujah in his coming Jesus himself
[1:41:13] come at the fullest of time amen and in
[1:41:17] this age the complete revelation of God
[1:41:19] comes in at the amen season
[1:41:23] it will not fault then there will need
[1:41:26] to be premature it comes at the amen
[1:41:29] season where all things are summing up
[1:41:33] amen where he has called the children
[1:41:35] and says this is your season
[1:41:40] I'm the amen
[1:41:42] no any other Church
[1:41:44] know any other messenger this is the
[1:41:47] amenh and I have called you to be an
[1:41:50] overcomer in this amen age and he that
[1:41:54] overcometh will like Grant to sit with
[1:41:56] me in my throne
[1:41:59] amen so in this age he's the amen the
[1:42:03] fullness of the Revelation in the
[1:42:06] fullness of time the Amen in the amen
[1:42:09] age
[1:42:12] here we are friends
[1:42:14] amen
[1:42:17] let's go through the I mean you know
[1:42:19] very well Revelation 3 14 are not at the
[1:42:23] end of the Church of the auditions right
[1:42:25] this thing says the amen the amen
[1:42:29] because we have come to the fullness of
[1:42:31] time time shall be no more
[1:42:35] the faithful the faithful because he
[1:42:38] never fails on any of his promises to
[1:42:40] the season
[1:42:42] amen and true witness
[1:42:45] true witness because he is not hiding
[1:42:49] himself behind any Shadows anymore
[1:42:53] I'm he that is true is Christ in
[1:42:57] Plainview now
[1:43:00] it's not Christ hiding behind the
[1:43:03] ministry of the son of man
[1:43:06] it is Christ's in plain view
[1:43:10] this is the season where we are so and
[1:43:14] this is what Lord this year has locked
[1:43:16] out they locked out the fullness of the
[1:43:19] godhead from the Buddha Believers so
[1:43:22] that he she could have the preeminess
[1:43:26] that's what they wanted
[1:43:28] they said I got the gold I got the
[1:43:31] wealth I have need of nothing
[1:43:37] the very seal of eternal life
[1:43:42] so the 11th Hour message the 11th Hour
[1:43:46] anointing and as we keep going people in
[1:43:50] this message don't know what they are
[1:43:55] dealing with
[1:43:58] it is the token himself
[1:44:01] that Lord this year locked out
[1:44:05] and I won't tell you that we are an
[1:44:08] octave much higher than Pentecost where
[1:44:12] the token himself becomes the amen
[1:44:15] message to every individual
[1:44:19] you must serve the ability to
[1:44:22] individually lay your hand on this
[1:44:24] message
[1:44:27] amen
[1:44:29] so let me just give you these quotes
[1:44:32] here I think I may not manage to bring
[1:44:36] the whole thing amen
[1:44:39] so now uh leodicia locked out the 11th
[1:44:44] Hour
[1:44:45] you know
[1:44:47] anointing
[1:44:52] because in this anointing
[1:44:55] is totally different it is come receive
[1:44:59] your reward
[1:45:01] I may not have the time to go into that
[1:45:04] but the season now
[1:45:07] is called them and let them receive
[1:45:11] their reward
[1:45:14] and brother Branham tells us
[1:45:18] that the reward of Naomi was a person
[1:45:26] did you get that
[1:45:28] amen that reward of Naomi was a person
[1:45:35] so what the rest of the people have
[1:45:38] walked out of it is the time of the
[1:45:42] reward and that reward is a person
[1:45:47] we come here to get United
[1:45:50] Water we were uniting with the passing
[1:45:54] of the Lord Jesus himself he has come
[1:45:57] down Among Us
[1:46:01] it's the invisible Union
[1:46:03] it's the presence of the person he's
[1:46:07] walking us back to Eden he has got us as
[1:46:11] his own Pride
[1:46:14] see I wish we had enough time to deal
[1:46:18] with this
[1:46:20] to realize the season Where We Are
[1:46:24] and the moment brother Branham says when
[1:46:28] we know who we are
[1:46:30] the Rapture will go
[1:46:35] Lord I must
[1:46:37] that will come to a point of knowing Who
[1:46:40] We Are and what season we are in
[1:46:45] less than
[1:46:50] he's good to us this evening
[1:46:55] this is the season
[1:46:58] this is the time
[1:47:01] we are not receiving portions anymore
[1:47:05] like there was a portion through the
[1:47:07] seven churchages
[1:47:09] he would come and say I am he I am here
[1:47:12] I am here
[1:47:14] but now
[1:47:16] the fullness
[1:47:18] is come down
[1:47:20] you know people seek for the perfume of
[1:47:23] the holy spirit with the Pentecostal
[1:47:26] Dimension what they are looking for is
[1:47:29] an anointing
[1:47:31] but we are far above the anointing
[1:47:35] seasons
[1:47:36] because the fullness of the person is
[1:47:40] here
[1:47:41] what we have now is the token amen amen
[1:47:47] this is our season
[1:47:50] I wish we could have got into time
[1:47:53] to know what our promises are and to
[1:47:56] know what the holy spirit is anointing
[1:48:00] for his people
[1:48:03] says call them it's reward time
[1:48:06] and they all come
[1:48:10] we are here
[1:48:12] we are in a certain presence
[1:48:16] the amen is here
[1:48:19] precious Heavenly Father
[1:48:22] Lord God some of these things
[1:48:25] we could be limited
[1:48:30] by the natural language
[1:48:33] but the way you work father is not
[1:48:36] through the intellect
[1:48:38] you've got a way how you can work these
[1:48:41] things into the hearts of the people
[1:48:44] I pray Heavenly Father
[1:48:47] that what you have spoken to us
[1:48:50] may it be hidden
[1:48:53] in the bottom of our hearts Heavenly
[1:48:55] Father
[1:48:56] that by grace
[1:48:58] the Reigns Lord God May Reign upon it

[1:49:12] that you may bless them
[1:49:14] they've hidden this word in their hearts
[1:49:17] and I trust Lord that as you fellowship
[1:49:21] with them
[1:49:22] they will say this day this scriptures
[1:49:25] fulfilled when they see this word become
[1:49:28] alive

[1:57:02] thank you Lord Jesus
[1:57:05] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:57:08] oh thank you Lord for this moment
[1:57:12] glory be to God
[1:57:14] thank you Lord Jesus

[1:57:21] blessed be the name of the Lord

[1:57:33] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:57:36] thank you Jesus thank you Jesus
[1:57:40] glory be to God
[1:57:43] there's truly never been a day like this
[1:57:45] day
[1:57:47] you know when you
[1:57:49] we look in the scripture and it's the
[1:57:51] announcement
[1:57:53] and it's calling it calls to us that's
[1:57:55] what the word calls to us arise and
[1:57:57] shine for thy light
[1:58:00] has come and the glory of the Lord has
[1:58:03] risen upon thee
[1:58:06] amen the messenger he received his light
[1:58:11] he shed that light and now that same
[1:58:14] light has come for you and I and that's
[1:58:17] why the scripture goes personally to us
[1:58:19] arise and shine
[1:58:23] not about what we feel like or what we
[1:58:25] think is what God's thoughts are
[1:58:27] breaking over our life
[1:58:29] and it's God's thoughts arresting our
[1:58:31] thoughts God's thoughts moving and us
[1:58:34] moving into that into that Realm
[1:58:36] to believe all things
[1:58:39] I think as we go through and we look in
[1:58:41] our lives
[1:58:42] you know you find of how brother Stephen
[1:58:44] kept on coming back to that because we
[1:58:46] can look sometimes and we can look past
[1:58:49] the Simplicity of God revealing himself
[1:58:53] in our midst and in our lives
[1:58:56] remember when brother Branham took that
[1:58:58] he many times a week just say God in
[1:59:01] Simplicity but that's not all of the
[1:59:03] title the title is God
[1:59:06] revealing himself
[1:59:08] in Simplicity and then through the same
[1:59:13] way then through our lives so it's not
[1:59:16] just something in but it becomes through
[1:59:19] and so when you we look and we we're
[1:59:21] seeing that every what God has provided
[1:59:24] for us right now everything that God has
[1:59:28] provided we and ourselves are not able
[1:59:31] in ourselves to do it but God has
[1:59:34] provided in this hour a people that that
[1:59:37] word it just will come like Abraham I'll
[1:59:40] do what you say Lord
[1:59:42] I'll do what you say and it come to
[1:59:45] finally to a place that Abraham walks up
[1:59:47] on the mountain and what Abraham could
[1:59:50] not do
[1:59:51] God did
[1:59:53] and I think of that song even Jehovah
[1:59:55] Rapha that that scripture is talking
[1:59:58] more that that of that Redemptive name
[2:00:00] is more than just about God healing our
[2:00:03] body
[2:00:04] is I'll just say it like this it's more
[2:00:06] than even God healing our soul
[2:00:08] it's God healing us of all complexes God
[2:00:12] healing us of every bruise and every
[2:00:14] Scar and everything through our life
[2:00:15] because those are all avenues that Satan
[2:00:18] would love to get into and block
[2:00:20] God's working but he's Jehovah Rapha
[2:00:24] and you know what he'll only be Jehovah
[2:00:26] Rafa to you when you have neither
[2:00:28] Jehovah Rapha
[2:00:30] and then when you have need of Jehovah
[2:00:31] Shema he will reveal himself as Jehovah
[2:00:33] Shema but it's the same God all the time
[2:00:36] it just depends on what you have need of
[2:00:38] and so it's our needs that brings the
[2:00:41] revealing of him on the scene
[2:00:43] oh my all that we have need of he's
[2:00:47] he's our moment this is our season
[2:00:49] this is a Time
[2:00:51] so I'd say just you know just just lay
[2:00:55] aside all the thoughts of that lay aside
[2:00:57] tonight I believe the word has just come
[2:00:59] to wash us
[2:01:01] to lay all of that aside that oh I wish
[2:01:04] I could have done this I wish I could
[2:01:05] have done this if we are in the season
[2:01:07] right now
[2:01:08] the past is the past and the only thing
[2:01:11] that we can do is be occupied with that
[2:01:14] of the present that'll lead us into the
[2:01:16] future
[2:01:17] amen and that's just how God works in
[2:01:19] our lives and I'm grateful he supplies
[2:01:22] what we have need of right now
[2:01:27] so that we can say in our lives this day
[2:01:29] this scripture is fulfilled
[2:01:32] amen don't you love him
[2:01:35] the uh the thing that just causes me to
[2:01:39] love the Lord even more
[2:01:42] is how simple he is
[2:01:44] it's just so simple
[2:01:45] he just work it's him working in our
[2:01:48] lives little by little by little
[2:01:51] God doesn't want to overwhelm us because
[2:01:53] we wouldn't catch it
[2:01:55] but God God does things and we catch it
[2:01:59] and he does it in such a way that we
[2:02:02] would catch it and recognize it's him
[2:02:04] and how many things you know when we I
[2:02:06] think of even some of the things when we
[2:02:08] look at it
[2:02:09] sometimes we get in a hurry don't we
[2:02:11] we're living in an age where everything
[2:02:13] is so instant I mean it's even more
[2:02:15] instinct
[2:02:16] you know
[2:02:18] if when you put something in on email if
[2:02:20] it doesn't come up that way if your
[2:02:21] website doesn't come up with it
[2:02:23] everything is so instant and yet that's
[2:02:25] not how the Holy Spirit works
[2:02:28] that's not even how the new birth works
[2:02:31] is the holy spirit working
[2:02:34] moving
[2:02:35] developing in our life
[2:02:37] where the brem said he comes in like a
[2:02:39] little white button and he spreads
[2:02:40] himself out
[2:02:42] what is it it's the same God working all
[2:02:45] the way through our lives
[2:02:47] it begins in justification same Holy
[2:02:49] Spirit working in sanctification same
[2:02:52] Holy Spirit and then into the baptism of
[2:02:54] all the same Holy Spirit same God all
[2:02:57] the time
[2:02:57] he's just like brother REM said more of
[2:03:00] him
[2:03:02] it's more of him
[2:03:04] and that's why God is working it's more
[2:03:06] of him it's more of him it's more I want
[2:03:09] more of him
[2:03:10] I want more of him I want more of him I
[2:03:13] want more of him
[2:03:15] amen do you love him tonight
[2:03:18] amen I tell you we have
[2:03:21] we have been fed tonight
[2:03:23] and the Lord has really spoke to our
[2:03:25] hearts and my just so appreciate that
[2:03:27] appreciate the gift amen and brother
[2:03:30] Stephen's life and we want to continue
[2:03:32] to remember them in prayer the brother's
[2:03:34] there and truly you've seen some of the
[2:03:36] magazines or the booklets that is put
[2:03:39] out
[2:03:40] by Cloverdale and brother Tim Dodd and a
[2:03:43] lot they're involved in that and you see
[2:03:44] that that's going on in Uganda
[2:03:47] it's a real Revival that is taking place
[2:03:50] there amen and so
[2:03:53] we just want to continue to pray for
[2:03:55] them and it's just been so good tonight
[2:03:57] you know I what I love about it is when
[2:03:59] we leave even out of the presence of the
[2:04:01] Lord here right now we're not really
[2:04:02] leaving out of his presence
[2:04:05] but as we take that word and just
[2:04:07] continue to meditate on it and I think
[2:04:09] of one of the things like the questions
[2:04:10] that was stated here tonight
[2:04:13] is to recognize we're we're here not by
[2:04:16] chance we're here
[2:04:19] by a divine plan
[2:04:21] and to say Lord what would you have me
[2:04:24] to do
[2:04:25] in this season
[2:04:27] what would you have me to do and just
[2:04:29] it's just that simple just be that
[2:04:31] simple before the Lord just to say God
[2:04:34] keep adding a line on top of line word
[2:04:37] on top a word in my life just Lord just
[2:04:39] just keep moving in me and you know the
[2:04:41] greatest thing we can do is surrender
[2:04:43] just like that
[2:04:44] allow God to keep working
[2:04:47] man let's just bow our heads in a word
[2:04:48] of Prayer
[2:04:49] Lord we
[2:04:54] Lord once again we find ourselves say
[2:04:58] thank you
[2:05:00] but feeling as though those words are
[2:05:02] not even adequate to describe
[2:05:05] the Thanksgiving that we have in our
[2:05:08] souls
[2:05:10] Lord it is truly
[2:05:13] a peace that passes all understanding
[2:05:16] it's a joy
[2:05:18] that the world has not given
[2:05:20] neither can the world or any test or
[2:05:23] trial of life ever take that Joy away
[2:05:26] because that Joy
[2:05:28] it's your life it's you
[2:05:31] you father you give us Grace Lord
[2:05:34] in every part of the Season that we're
[2:05:36] in
[2:05:37] Lord I pray that you would help us
[2:05:40] knowing that one of the great flaws that
[2:05:44] we have and we must overcome in our
[2:05:46] Humanity
[2:05:48] is that of impatience
[2:05:50] we like to see things quickly quickly
[2:05:52] quickly quickly quickly quickly
[2:05:55] but yet dear God as you would say in
[2:05:57] your word with patience possess you your
[2:06:00] souls
[2:06:02] patience
[2:06:04] is that virtue to wait upon God's word
[2:06:06] God has promised the word and in its
[2:06:09] season it will come to pass
[2:06:12] Joseph as a 17 year old boy went into
[2:06:15] prison
[2:06:16] and he had a promise of the word
[2:06:20] and yet not knowing what was going on
[2:06:22] while he was there in that prison and
[2:06:24] the Bible tells us Lord that the word of
[2:06:27] the Lord Tried Him
[2:06:30] until
[2:06:31] the season for it to be fulfilled
[2:06:35] so Lord the tested trials that have come
[2:06:38] our way now we know we have a sure word
[2:06:40] of Prophecy that we have received in our
[2:06:43] lives so every test every trial every
[2:06:45] part Lord right now
[2:06:47] may it bring us into that place like it
[2:06:50] brought Joseph
[2:06:52] to where Joseph came to such a place
[2:06:54] where he looked at himself as a total
[2:06:56] failure and then he could yield
[2:06:58] completely to you and as your Prophet
[2:07:02] said the gift you placed in him is the
[2:07:04] very thing you use to get him out of the
[2:07:06] situation he was in
[2:07:08] so Lord we believe that God is you
[2:07:10] working fully in our life
[2:07:12] that will bring the very change
[2:07:15] of the atoms of our body
[2:07:17] you know being the complete change Lord
[2:07:20] help us Lord not that we look down upon
[2:07:23] ourselves but that we recognize that
[2:07:25] without you we can do nothing
[2:07:28] that we're not going to move ahead of
[2:07:30] time be pushed or pulled but we are to
[2:07:33] follow you Lord
[2:07:35] knowing that God we are moved by thus
[2:07:38] saith the Lord
[2:07:39] and that Lord Your Grace would come to
[2:07:42] us as we see in the prophets meetings
[2:07:43] that even if we were to Lord it was
[2:07:47] going over our head you will call our
[2:07:49] name so that we do not miss
[2:07:52] the anointing
[2:07:53] that you have for us
[2:07:55] in this season
[2:07:57] what rest what peace what shalom
[2:08:00] oh God may you just continue to move and
[2:08:03] to work in our lives Lord
[2:08:06] we love you and we thank you
[2:08:09] and Lord like that of Hannah like that
[2:08:12] of Sarah
[2:08:13] like that of the others Lord
[2:08:17] once we have received the touch from you
[2:08:19] there is a groaning within our hearts
[2:08:21] there's a desire
[2:08:22] a longing for more of you along for the
[2:08:26] word
[2:08:27] to be fulfilled
[2:08:29] granted Lord we just want to give
[2:08:31] ourselves more to you and we want more
[2:08:33] and more and more and more of you Lord
[2:08:38] granted Lord we pray may you just
[2:08:40] continue to move Lord in every life
[2:08:43] every heart in a simple simple way
[2:08:45] because that's how you do Lord
