[34:49] out cruelty I had fainted unless I had
[34:53] believed to see the goodness of the Lord
[34:54] in the land of the living but wait on
[34:57] the Lord Lord be of good courage and he
[34:59] shall strengthen thine heart wait I say
[35:02] on the
[35:03] Lord amen if we could bow our
[35:06] heads and if you have a need this
[35:08] morning just make it known unto the Lord
[35:12] amen he's never present help in the time
[35:15] of
[35:16] trouble Heavenly Father we approach your
[35:20] throne this morning Lord with confidence
[35:23] father Lord that you see the very depths
[35:26] of our hearts Lord that your word is
[35:28] still a discerner of the thoughts and
[35:30] the intents of the heart father we
[35:32] approach you boldly father knowing Lord
[35:35] that all things are possible to them
[35:37] that believe father Lord that we can ask
[35:40] and believe and we believe that we shall
[35:42] receive that which we have asked Lord
[35:44] that if we seek we shall find Lord if we
[35:47] knock it shall be opened unto us Lord
[35:50] father if we ask for bread would you
[35:53] give us a stone father Lord but you are
[35:56] a mighty God and and we call upon your
[35:58] name this morning asking father that you
[36:00] just have your way in this meeting Lord
[36:03] praying that your spirit would just
[36:04] begin to come down and brw through this
[36:06] congregation father and minister to the
[36:09] needs of your children Lord and we'll be
[36:11] sure to give you the glory and the honor
[36:13] father as we commit this service into
[36:15] your hands in Jesus name amen you may
[36:19] have your seats this morning we're going
[36:21] to take a thought if we could out of
[36:23] that first verse and if we could take a
[36:26] title it be the strength of my life the
[36:29] strength of my life and when we talk
[36:31] about strength there's different types
[36:32] of strength you know there's the
[36:34] strength of the natural man the strength
[36:37] of of your muscles to be able to do a
[36:39] certain amount of work or lift a certain
[36:41] amount of weight you have a natural
[36:44] strength and brother Brandon would say
[36:46] that um that Christians sometimes would
[36:49] have a so-called religious strength
[36:51] where they would burn a candle every
[36:52] night amen or put their name on a book
[36:56] and and think that that they were
[36:57] getting strength from that it's the
[36:59] strength of Christianity so-called
[37:01] brother Brandon would say but what we're
[37:03] talking about like David would speak
[37:05] about is spiritual strength that the
[37:07] Christian has it's it's a strength that
[37:10] he could say the Lord is the strength of
[37:11] my life amen it's it's not the strength
[37:14] of your natural physique but it's the
[37:16] strength of of your spirit it's the
[37:19] strength that that allows you to
[37:21] overcome daily and and David would say
[37:23] the Lord is the strength of my life and
[37:26] if you look at the definition of of that
[37:27] word strength it's in one sentence the
[37:30] quality or state of being physically
[37:32] strong but another definition is the
[37:35] capacity of an object or substance to
[37:37] withstand great force or pressure amen
[37:40] and we're living in a time of great
[37:42] force and a time of great pressure uh
[37:45] the Church of the Living God is under a
[37:47] pressure amen and the world as a whole
[37:49] is under a pressure but but spiritual
[37:51] warfare uh the believer faces it every
[37:54] day and and and when you begin to come
[37:56] and maybe into even a closer walk with
[37:58] the Lord sometimes you face greater
[38:01] pressures and and greater trials amen
[38:03] because the Lord's testing his children
[38:05] and he puts you through the pressures
[38:07] but he's given you a strength to
[38:08] withstand the pressures and me to
[38:10] withstand would be to to remain
[38:12] undamaged by or to remain unaffected by
[38:15] me that you can go through a trial but
[38:17] but it doesn't damage you it it doesn't
[38:19] even affect you am mean like those like
[38:21] those Hebrew children would go through
[38:23] the fiery furnace and the smell of smoke
[38:25] wouldn't even be wouldn't even be on
[38:27] when they come through it and that's
[38:29] what it is to have a strength to
[38:30] withstand it's that you can come through
[38:32] something and remain unaffected you
[38:34] don't lose your faith you don't lose
[38:36] your joy you you don't lose your worship
[38:39] and me you still come to the house of
[38:41] God because it's a strength of your life
[38:43] that you're able to withstand as Paul
[38:46] would write take onto you the whole
[38:48] armor of God that you may be able to
[38:50] withstand in the evil day and having
[38:52] done all to stand amen for we are
[38:54] fighting a strong enemy but brother
[38:56] Brandon would say our Warfare is not
[38:58] carnal but it's strong Bringing Down the
[39:01] strongholds of the enemy amen I I like
[39:04] this brother brandom this a whole prayer
[39:06] but in this prayer brother brandom says
[39:09] that we father God we would not only
[39:11] pray for these here but for those
[39:13] stretched out across the world that are
[39:15] needy both spiritually and physically
[39:18] give to them oh Lord the desires of
[39:20] their hearts because thy children are
[39:22] struggling in these days he said the
[39:25] oppression of the enemy is so strong but
[39:28] Thou Art stronger for it is written
[39:31] greater is he that's in you that is than
[39:33] he that is in the world Amen and I just
[39:35] like the devil to hear that today I mean
[39:38] uh the devil is strong the oppression of
[39:40] the enemy is strong but God has said
[39:43] greater is he that's in you than he
[39:45] that's in the world and we serve a god
[39:47] that is stronger than any devil a god
[39:50] that is stronger than any Spirit than
[39:52] any opposition but he said I'll give you
[39:55] a strength that you might withstand
[39:57] because something about that devil he
[39:58] cannot withstand the word of God Amen
[40:02] brother Brandon would come into contact
[40:04] with with doctors of divinity and all
[40:06] kinds of things and and they would boast
[40:08] and they and they would Bluff and they
[40:09] would have a loud voice of opposition
[40:12] against him but whenever he would make
[40:14] the claim you come up here on this
[40:15] platform and you show me in the
[40:17] scriptures where I'm wrong they would
[40:19] they would never come in the presence of
[40:21] that word because Satan can't withstand
[40:23] the word am mean he he he's got a loud
[40:25] voice he he he's got got a scary voice
[40:28] and he's got a loud boast but he has no
[40:30] strength to withstand the word of God
[40:33] and mean that's why you as Believers
[40:34] when the Lord becomes the strength of
[40:36] your life you have an ability to
[40:38] withstand through the word every
[40:40] opposition every spirit amen out of hell
[40:43] and me every sickness that the devil try
[40:45] to throw against you you have an ability
[40:48] to withstand amen because God has
[40:51] provided a place for you to go and hide
[40:53] from the fiery darts of the enemy and me
[40:57] and the Lord is the strength of my life
[40:58] when David would write this if you look
[41:00] in the strong concordance what that word
[41:02] strength means it's a fortified place or
[41:05] or a fortress it's a defense and in
[41:08] Jeremiah it would even write oh Lord my
[41:10] strength and my Fortress and my refuge
[41:13] in the day of affliction mean God has
[41:15] provided for us a strength that would be
[41:17] like a fortress all around you and and
[41:20] that's why David could write in Psalms
[41:22] 27 that when the wicked even my enemies
[41:25] and my foes come against me he said who
[41:27] shall I fear is that the Lord is the
[41:29] strength of my life of whom shall I be
[41:31] afraid amen the believer's not been
[41:33] given the spirit of fear but that's why
[41:35] you can stand in the face of enemy and
[41:37] say I do not fear the wicked I do not
[41:40] fear my foes I do not fear my enemies
[41:43] because the Lord is my Fortress amen the
[41:46] name of the Lord is a strong tower that
[41:48] the righteous would run into it and they
[41:50] would be safe amen a a man that's born
[41:53] of the kingdom of God a man that's born
[41:55] of the Holy Ghost has not one thing to
[41:57] fear how many times when you turn on the
[42:00] tape you hear brother brandom saying if
[42:01] I could just get the fear away from the
[42:03] church if I could just get them to see
[42:05] who they are and and and and where
[42:07] they're standing then they then there
[42:09] wouldn't be any fear upon them and if
[42:11] you could ever get to that place to
[42:13] realize that you are HID away in the
[42:15] time of trouble and mean that when the
[42:17] world is falling apart all around us you
[42:19] don't have one thing to fear amen your
[42:22] future is clear amen it's secure Amen
[42:25] brother Brandon would come and preach to
[42:26] us the message modern events made clear
[42:29] by prophecy amen it wasn't modern events
[42:32] made confused by prophecy but when we
[42:34] look out at this world Amen and to the
[42:37] Natural man it would look like the
[42:38] future is so unclear everything is so
[42:40] unstable amen but we've received a
[42:43] Vindicated word which has brought
[42:44] Clarity Amen in modern events the what's
[42:48] going on in the world what's going on in
[42:50] politics am me we're not confused but
[42:52] it's clearer than ever before that we
[42:54] are living in the Vindication and
[42:56] fulfillment of the words of the prophets
[42:58] that have come before us amen it's clear
[43:01] modern events have been made clear and
[43:03] to those that are in The Fortress amen
[43:06] you have nothing to fear you are HID
[43:08] away amen the Rapture is our goal
[43:11] there's a Clarity there's an
[43:13] overcoming oh there's a hidden place you
[43:16] can go with the Lord and let off the
[43:18] pressures and withstand the pressure of
[43:21] this neurotic age amen but it's it's got
[43:24] to come through the Lord amen for for in
[43:27] Romans it would say that that for when
[43:29] we were yet without Strength In Due Time
[43:32] Christ died for the ungodly amen and so
[43:35] we didn't always have this strength amen
[43:38] this strength didn't always belong to
[43:40] the Church of the Living God but God
[43:42] made a a way that that that in his own
[43:46] strength of a natural man that he would
[43:48] be willing to walk that road to gotha he
[43:52] would be willing to take the humble road
[43:54] to Calvary amen and as he w walked that
[43:57] road the blood would drip down from his
[43:59] legs amen and that and that animal skin
[44:03] would slap against those bloody legs
[44:05] amen but brother Aaron what was
[44:07] happening was he was becoming weaker and
[44:09] weaker as that blood left his body as he
[44:12] would cry out my God why has Thou
[44:15] forsaken me and in the weakest condition
[44:17] that he would ever stand he was making a
[44:19] way that he would pour a strength back
[44:22] on the Church of the Living God and mean
[44:24] that you might have strength in this
[44:26] darkest stage that you would have
[44:28] something and mean that would hold you
[44:30] you would have something that would keep
[44:31] you in the darkest of hours but it would
[44:34] have to come from the supernatural
[44:36] strength of the Lord amen that he would
[44:38] provide a baptism of the Holy Ghost that
[44:41] he would pour out upon the church amen
[44:44] that you would have strength to overcome
[44:46] because we're in a contest amen and
[44:48] brother Brandon would preach a sermon a
[44:50] contest and he said a contest is the
[44:52] test of strength it said those Indians
[44:54] used to take a a rope all right like
[44:57] like a tug of war and and they would
[44:59] build a fire and they would get uh they
[45:01] would get um uh on both sides of the
[45:03] Rope you all you all know how tug of war
[45:05] works and they would build a fire in the
[45:07] middle and whoever would show the
[45:09] greatest strength would win and pull the
[45:11] enemy into the fire now brother br's
[45:13] showing us that there's a contest coming
[45:16] between Satan and the Church of the
[45:18] Living God he said it started in heaven
[45:21] uh Satan was kicked out and now he's
[45:23] trying to use all of his strength to
[45:25] pull God's children into the fires amen
[45:28] and he would be able to do it if we
[45:30] didn't have a greater force but God sent
[45:32] his word that that word and you would be
[45:35] a greater force that you could pull the
[45:37] enemy into the fires that he has created
[45:40] amen that what the enemy meant for evil
[45:42] God could work it together for your good
[45:45] amen and the strength of the word in you
[45:47] would be a greater strength than the
[45:49] strength of the enemy amen and it's not
[45:52] just the strength of a letter for the
[45:54] letter kth but the spirit giveth life
[45:57] when that word comes inside of your
[45:59] heart it brings a supernatural strength
[46:02] amen that'll give you an overcoming life
[46:04] it'll give you an overcoming power but
[46:06] it's got to be the word in you amen it's
[46:09] got to be uh you're fortified in the
[46:12] word of the Living God am mean am mean
[46:15] you train for battle amen learn learn
[46:18] learn how your enemy comes you learn how
[46:21] to counter attack you learn how to fight
[46:23] with the word of God and and with prayer
[46:26] and you learn that your own ability will
[46:28] never win the battle amen have you ever
[46:31] been there you Tred to do it in your own
[46:33] ability but you try fighting God's God's
[46:36] appointed way one time and you realize
[46:39] there's a different force on your side
[46:41] amen we we uh God because the one that
[46:45] won the battle in heaven amen the one
[46:48] that defeated Satan in heaven and cast
[46:50] him down amen but he didn't just cast
[46:52] Satan down into the Earth and leave us
[46:54] here alone but he came down himself amen
[46:58] he came down and put himself inside of a
[47:01] people inside of a bride amen and so the
[47:05] one that's already won the battle in
[47:07] heaven a amen it's a rigged fight amen
[47:10] if you'll just accept that into your
[47:13] heart if you'll just accept the same
[47:15] life that has already defeated Satan
[47:18] that life will never lose amen we have
[47:21] the brother Brandon would say and is
[47:23] anything too hard for the Lord we got
[47:26] the Mighty God for our God oh my David
[47:30] would write who is this king of glory
[47:33] he's the Lord strong and mighty amen
[47:36] he's the Lord Mighty in battle so lift
[47:38] up your heads oh ye gates even lift them
[47:41] up ye Everlasting doors and the king of
[47:44] glory shall come in who is this king of
[47:46] glory it's the Lord of hosts he is the
[47:49] king of glory amen brother brand say
[47:52] I've never seen him come into battle yet
[47:54] but what he comes out packing the
[47:55] victory amen in the same one that won
[47:58] battles in heaven and me he's winning
[48:01] battles through his church all
[48:02] throughout the ages and now we know that
[48:05] we are have the assurance that this
[48:08] battle we will win amen we're going to
[48:10] win Church the bride is going to win
[48:13] this thing we've already seen the back
[48:15] of the book amen and when the Lord is
[48:18] the strength of your life and when that
[48:20] strength comes into you you have the
[48:22] ability to strengthen others and me you
[48:25] know even how how the Lord would tell
[48:27] Peter after you are converted strengthen
[48:29] your brethren how could he strengthen
[48:32] his Brethren before he had been
[48:34] converted he didn't have anything to
[48:35] strengthen him with but after he went up
[48:38] to to to Pentecost amen he received
[48:41] something that he could strengthen his
[48:43] Brethren amen and and and as Christians
[48:46] we can draw strength from others amen
[48:48] you can draw strength from your father
[48:50] you can draw strength from your mother
[48:52] you can draw strength from your pastor
[48:54] but there's got to come a time in your
[48:56] life where you've got to receive a
[48:58] personal encounter and have a strength
[49:01] in your own
[49:02] life if you're just depending upon
[49:04] pastor's strength you'll get to a valley
[49:07] one time and realize that you don't have
[49:09] what it takes that you don't have the
[49:11] same thing that your pastor has but it's
[49:13] got to be a personal strength that that
[49:16] goes with you all the days of your life
[49:19] that's what David had Amen in in Psalms
[49:22] I it would take about all day to read
[49:25] how many times David talked talks about
[49:27] this but just to just for an example in
[49:29] Psalms 19 he would say oh Lord my
[49:32] strength and my redeemer Psalms 28 the
[49:35] Lord is my strength and my shield my
[49:37] heart trusteed in him and I am helped
[49:39] therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth and
[49:42] with my song will I praise him the Lord
[49:43] is their strength and he is the saving
[49:45] strength of his anointed Psalms 46 God
[49:48] is our refuge and strength a very
[49:51] present help and trouble Psalms 81 sing
[49:53] aloud unto God our strength Psalms 18
[49:56] the Lord is my strength and song and has
[49:59] become my salvation Psalms 144 blessed
[50:02] be the Lord my strength which teaches
[50:05] teacheth My Hands to War and my fingers
[50:07] to fight do you see a theme here all
[50:10] throughout David's life all throughout
[50:12] David's Ministry he was saying that
[50:14] there was only one source of his
[50:16] strength and that was the Lord the Lord
[50:19] was the strength of his life the Lord
[50:21] was his very present help in the time of
[50:23] trouble and so we realize something that
[50:25] that this bu building is not our
[50:27] strength am mean these pews are not our
[50:29] strength the music is not our strength
[50:32] all the form and all the church order
[50:35] and none of that is our strength but we
[50:37] have one source for our strength and
[50:40] that is the Lord himself the Lord
[50:42] himself is the strength of my life the
[50:44] Lord himself is the strength in My
[50:46] Darkest Hours amen it comes only from
[50:49] the Lord amen it doesn't come I mean the
[50:51] strength of this church isn't just
[50:53] brother Samuel the strength of this
[50:55] church isn't the mum Ians and the song
[50:57] leaders but the strength of this church
[50:59] is the Lord himself amen the god of
[51:02] Abraham Isaac and Jacob amen that Pillar
[51:05] of Fire is accompanying this message and
[51:08] as he comes into the services here and
[51:10] me he begins to breathe strength into
[51:13] into the congregation he begins to
[51:15] breathe strength over his children amen
[51:17] but don't mistake it for anything else
[51:19] but the Lord because he alone is the
[51:22] strength of this bride amen it's the
[51:25] Lord God has divided because you see
[51:28] when they were going to send the ark
[51:30] over the the flood in the days of Noah
[51:33] the Ark was made out of gopher wood amen
[51:36] and that gopher wood was a light uh uh
[51:39] very airy wood that that would soak up
[51:41] water very fast and so they would take
[51:44] that gopher wood and they would empty
[51:45] out all the resin out of it that that
[51:47] was in it in its natural condition and
[51:50] as it became emptied out anden if they
[51:52] would to float that over the water it
[51:54] would just soak up the water and it
[51:56] wouldn't stand a chance but that's why
[51:58] they would take the resin or the pitch
[52:00] and put it over that Ark and then it
[52:02] would become after it hardened up it
[52:04] would become as hard as steel anden and
[52:07] and that's the believer's life that you
[52:09] are just a light piece of wood and you
[52:12] can empty yourself out and you can you
[52:15] can be justified and Sanctified but you
[52:18] you're just then in a place that you're
[52:20] you're able to soak up but if you don't
[52:22] fill it with the Lord you you can begin
[52:24] to fill it with all kinds of other
[52:26] things but but if you fill that with the
[52:28] the pitch or the Holy Ghost then it will
[52:31] give you a strength to go over every
[52:34] trial and every test but God and so God
[52:37] has provided for us he knows our
[52:39] condition amen he knows our humanity and
[52:42] he has provided for us a strength that's
[52:45] why he promised us the baptism of the
[52:47] Holy Ghost Amen in Isaiah 28 it spoke
[52:50] that that there would come a rest that
[52:52] there would come a refreshing amen that
[52:55] was stammering lips and other tongues
[52:57] amen that it would it would write about
[52:59] it in the book of Isaiah that he will
[53:01] speak to this people and he said this is
[53:03] the rest wherewith you may cause the
[53:05] weary to rest and this is the refreshing
[53:08] and he was speaking of the promise that
[53:11] he would pour out the Holy Ghost on the
[53:12] day of Pentecost is that right amen
[53:15] where 120 empty vessels would come up
[53:17] into the upper room and they would be
[53:19] filled or endued with a power that would
[53:22] send them out where before brother brand
[53:24] would say how before you know they were
[53:26] just a bunch of cowards amen hiding up
[53:28] there in that upper room but when that
[53:30] that when that baptism Came Upon him
[53:33] they sent him out into the streets with
[53:34] the testimony it made them Witnesses of
[53:37] the great power of the Holy Ghost and
[53:39] brother BR talks about how the when the
[53:41] priest would come into his office in the
[53:43] Old Testament he would go behind the
[53:45] veil and partake of that original Mana
[53:48] amen but God has provided a holy ghost
[53:50] that would be a a manner that he would
[53:52] pour out upon his church and it wouldn't
[53:54] just be a mouthful but brother say A
[53:57] Soulful of the original Mana could come
[53:59] back upon your heart and mean that you
[54:01] could draw strength from the Mana of the
[54:04] Holy Ghost amen and if you look at that
[54:08] if you look at that scripture in Isaiah
[54:09] 28 uh before before it speaks of the
[54:12] refreshing in verse 5 it says in that
[54:15] day shall the Lord of hosts be for a
[54:17] Crown of Glory and for a diadem of
[54:20] beauty onto the residue of his people
[54:22] brother brandom says that that he is
[54:24] speaking of the great day when the
[54:26] witness would come he said what is our
[54:28] Crown he said the Holy Spirit crowns us
[54:31] he said a Crown of Glory and a diadem of
[54:34] beauty onto the residue of the people
[54:36] brother BR said the residue is the
[54:38] people that's left over he said he'll be
[54:40] a diadem or a Crown of Glory a diadem of
[54:42] beauty speaking of 700 years before this
[54:46] happened that the Holy Ghost would come
[54:48] but then it says for a spirit of
[54:50] judgment to him that's sitting in
[54:52] judgment and for strength to them that
[54:54] turn the battle to the gate and and he
[54:57] says them who is standing for him and
[54:59] with him this great spirit that's
[55:02] prophesied will be the strength of him
[55:04] that stands at the gate Amen in the
[55:07] battle he is our strength amen we rely
[55:10] upon him not upon culture not upon
[55:13] education not upon things of the world
[55:15] not by power not by might but by my
[55:19] spirit sayeth the Lord Brother B said
[55:21] the church rests solemnly in that he
[55:24] will be the strength of him that stands
[55:25] in the gate
[55:26] not his theological background not his
[55:29] denominations but the Holy Ghost will be
[55:31] his strength he will be the one that
[55:33] will stand at the gate he'll rely upon
[55:35] the strength of the Holy Spirit to turn
[55:38] the alien away amen amen it'll be this
[55:42] it'll be uh for strength to them that
[55:45] turn the battle to the gate I mean when
[55:47] you you're in a battle and it's going to
[55:49] take a strength to defeat uh the aliens
[55:52] that's a maybe an odd word but it's
[55:54] spoken of in the Bible even in Hebrews
[55:57] 11 when it's talking about The Heroes of
[55:59] Faith it said they quenched the violence
[56:01] of fire they escaped the edge of the
[56:03] sword out of weakness they were made
[56:05] strong waxed Valiant and fight turned to
[56:08] flight the armies of the
[56:10] aliens we in a battle against some
[56:12] aliens and those aliens are Philistines
[56:15] and a and ammonites and when they
[56:18] encountered these Giants in the land I
[56:20] mean they were aliens they didn't belong
[56:22] they were from they were in their land
[56:24] they were they were foreign they were
[56:26] from another uh they were trespassing am
[56:29] mean on land that belonged to the
[56:31] children of Israel but but out of
[56:33] weakness there would come a strength
[56:34] that they might turn the aliens away and
[56:37] that's going to be the key to the Church
[56:38] of the Living God that out of weakness
[56:41] that a church would be made strong amen
[56:43] God would choose those that are weak God
[56:46] would choose the Beggars God would
[56:47] choose those that the widows and the
[56:49] poor those that those that would be able
[56:52] to empty out of all the strength of
[56:54] religion and all the strength of of
[56:56] Creeds and dogmas and just empty
[56:58] themselves out and say Lord I I'm weak
[57:01] and I'm nothing like Moses and like
[57:04] Samson and like all these great Heroes
[57:06] throughout the Bible say Lord I have no
[57:08] ability and at that time the Lord would
[57:10] say but I have a strength that I will
[57:13] put in your life that will give you
[57:14] overcoming power and if you want to be
[57:17] strong in the Lord it'll have to come
[57:19] through a total death to your own self a
[57:22] total death to your own ideas amen a
[57:25] total death to everything you know about
[57:27] the word like Paul had to empty out
[57:29] everything he learned under his
[57:31] education and his teaching and he had to
[57:34] go spend some time with the pillar of
[57:35] fire on the back side of the desert and
[57:38] recognize that his strength wasn't
[57:41] enough but the but the Revelation from
[57:43] the Lord himself amen would far surpass
[57:47] anything that he could learn amen but
[57:50] but but he wouldn't come in strength and
[57:52] but he would come in weakness amen and
[57:54] deliver to us uh a word amen and Moses
[57:57] would come in weakness and God would use
[57:59] them to lead the children of Israel out
[58:01] out of Egypt amen but God God has given
[58:05] us a strength and and let me just say
[58:07] this amen it is enough hallelujah amen
[58:11] his strength is enough amen I I I think
[58:14] we've all experienced that if you've
[58:16] been serving the lord at any time and
[58:19] you've trusted him you realize that his
[58:21] strength is enough amen Elijah come up
[58:24] against Jezebel religion and systems
[58:27] amen and he was a lonely man amen until
[58:30] the Lord had to remind him that there
[58:32] was there was many others just like him
[58:35] amen but but the Lord would begin to
[58:36] reveal to them that my strength is
[58:38] enough Elijah man you don't have to get
[58:41] it from Jezebel you don't have to get it
[58:43] from Big churches and big numbers but I
[58:45] will be your strength oh my man when
[58:49] brother Brandon was here he went through
[58:51] the Palaces of Oral Roberts and Billy
[58:53] Graham but and he would get discouraged
[58:55] thinking my their Ministries came even
[58:57] off of mine amen but but but he would
[59:00] begin to look up to the Lord and the
[59:02] Lord would tell him but but but I am
[59:05] your portion amen and when the Lord is
[59:07] your portion it's enough amen you don't
[59:09] have to go look into other sources and
[59:12] mean you don't have to go look into
[59:13] other things but when you find your
[59:15] strength in the Lord and you begin to
[59:17] get settled that it is enough it'll
[59:20] bring a stability to your life because
[59:22] you'll stop looking Amen to other places
[59:25] you'll stop looking around and digging
[59:26] around that maybe you've missed
[59:28] something you haven't missed nothing if
[59:30] you've made the Lord your strength he
[59:32] will be with you in The Valleys he'll be
[59:34] with you in the mountains amen and this
[59:36] word is enough amen we don't have to do
[59:39] anything to alter it amen we don't have
[59:41] to look to to Dr dos and and any other
[59:44] voices but God's voice has come down
[59:47] into this age and me and it's and it's
[59:49] captured the attention of a bride that
[59:51] would say that Lord that is enough for
[59:54] me that is enough for my family amen you
[59:57] got to stop depending upon your own
[59:59] strength amen stop depending upon your
[1:00:01] own abilities amen but cast your cares
[1:00:04] upon Him and He will care for you and me
[1:00:07] we need not fight in this battle friends
[1:00:09] but stand still and see the salvation of
[1:00:12] the Lord am mean you've been trying to
[1:00:14] fight it in your own ability and you're
[1:00:15] losing every time but let go and let God
[1:00:18] take over amen he's the master of the
[1:00:20] wind he's the maker of the rain he's
[1:00:23] still walking among the Church of the
[1:00:25] Living God God am mean he's in the
[1:00:27] building this morning because he said he
[1:00:29] would be and we recognize his presence
[1:00:32] and we worship the god of our strength
[1:00:34] and say Lord you are all I need Lord you
[1:00:37] are enough for me you are everything
[1:00:40] that I have need of in this journey Lord
[1:00:42] and you will get me through every trial
[1:00:45] oh you got to put the blinders on and me
[1:00:47] and stop looking to the left or right
[1:00:49] and look to the Lord who will pick you
[1:00:51] up out of the
[1:00:52] Waves oh he is the Lord he is the
[1:00:56] strength of my life amen it's perfect
[1:00:58] strength through perfect weakness amen
[1:01:01] and if you feel weak this morning you
[1:01:02] are a perfect candidate for the Lord to
[1:01:05] be the strength of your life and lift
[1:01:07] you up into Realms amen of strength and
[1:01:11] and anointing oh en courage Hallelujah
[1:01:14] that's what he would do for all of his
[1:01:17] great Heroes throughout the Bible they
[1:01:19] were just men like you and me but the
[1:01:21] anointing of the Lord made the
[1:01:23] difference Amen brother Brandon would
[1:01:24] talk about Samson
[1:01:26] he said I said Samson was the first
[1:01:28] sermon that brother brandom ever
[1:01:29] preached he said cuz he always liked
[1:01:31] strength but he said I couldn't just
[1:01:33] imagine Samson being a I couldn't
[1:01:36] imagine him being a very strong man
[1:01:38] brother B say I imagine him being kind
[1:01:40] of frail and kind of weak amen because
[1:01:43] that way when the Lord would use them
[1:01:45] for such magnificent things that the
[1:01:47] glory would go to the Lord amen so there
[1:01:50] Samson stood frail and weak amen but the
[1:01:54] but but scripture would tell of great
[1:01:56] events of strength that would happen in
[1:01:58] his life and it would write how the
[1:02:00] spirit of the Lord came mightily upon
[1:02:02] him and he slew a lion right and he slew
[1:02:05] 30 Philistines and then one day he would
[1:02:07] pick up the Jawbone of a mule and slew a
[1:02:11] thousand Philistines and man can you
[1:02:13] imagine I'm sure those Philistines had
[1:02:15] come into contact with many men before
[1:02:18] and had and had slayed them amen with
[1:02:20] their Philistine weapons but when they
[1:02:22] come into contact with the anointing of
[1:02:25] the Lord they didn't stand a chance and
[1:02:28] mean a thousand Philistines would fall
[1:02:30] just like that under the anointing of
[1:02:32] the Lord that was upon Samson and mean
[1:02:35] it was because the spirit of the Lord
[1:02:37] would come upon him it was because
[1:02:39] Samson let something into his life and
[1:02:42] me Samson let in a hidden power am me
[1:02:46] and he let in a hidden power that would
[1:02:48] be greater than anything he could ever
[1:02:50] do with his own ability and mean but it
[1:02:53] was it it it was the Lord I mean it
[1:02:56] wasn't some magic trick it wasn't it it
[1:02:59] wasn't brother brand say it's not like
[1:03:01] rubbing a rabbit's foot it's not like a
[1:03:03] lucky horseshoe it is it is a hidden
[1:03:06] power that comes through a birth amen
[1:03:09] and that's the only way it comes amen
[1:03:11] that you have to let it in and you have
[1:03:14] to let in that hidden power and then
[1:03:16] brother brandom says that that that that
[1:03:18] just like Samson packing those gates up
[1:03:20] he said you will pack those Brazen gates
[1:03:22] to Calvary and it'll make you pray for
[1:03:24] your brother and your sister and mean it
[1:03:27] it it'll make your life come into come
[1:03:29] into line with this word and mean and
[1:03:31] you won't have to manufacture it you
[1:03:33] won't have to sweat it out and work it
[1:03:35] up but when that hidden power comes into
[1:03:38] your life it'll be just as easy amen
[1:03:41] sure you'll have hard days but the
[1:03:43] manifestation of the word will come
[1:03:45] forth out of your life because it's
[1:03:47] something that's on the inside working
[1:03:49] its way outside and me and making a
[1:03:52] difference in my life like that old
[1:03:54] Sunday school song it's Jesus on the
[1:03:56] inside working on the outside it's a
[1:03:58] hidden power oh that's what gives you
[1:04:01] the fruits of the spirit that's what
[1:04:03] gives you love that's what makes you
[1:04:05] receive the word for your day it's it's
[1:04:08] the Holy Ghost friends it's a hidden
[1:04:10] power and that's what Samson had that he
[1:04:13] would come and come against these
[1:04:16] Philistines and and carry those Gates of
[1:04:18] the city but one time there come a a
[1:04:23] lady there uh or or maybe not a lady but
[1:04:26] a a woman or or you know not not a good
[1:04:30] lady her name was Delilah you all know
[1:04:33] the story that's right amen she would
[1:04:36] come and begin to ask Samson Samson
[1:04:40] where does that great strength come from
[1:04:43] you see brother Brandon warned us of
[1:04:45] three things especially in the ministry
[1:04:48] and that was woman money and popularity
[1:04:50] he said you always got to guard those
[1:04:51] areas because we have scriptural
[1:04:54] examples how how um Samson fell because
[1:04:57] of woman and Saul fell because of
[1:04:59] popularity and balum fell because of
[1:05:01] money so you have to guard those areas
[1:05:04] anden so here comes a woman Delilah in
[1:05:07] and begins to talk to Samson and say
[1:05:09] Samson where does thy great strength
[1:05:12] come from and he would tell her uh if
[1:05:14] you do such and such and and she would
[1:05:17] do it and she would say the Philistines
[1:05:18] be upon the Samson and Samson would
[1:05:21] break free from the cords and she would
[1:05:23] say why don't you love me Samson don't
[1:05:26] tell me where does thy great strength
[1:05:27] come from and she kept asking them where
[1:05:30] does it come from and she kept coming
[1:05:32] and and bugging them and asking them
[1:05:34] where does thy strength come from and
[1:05:36] brother brandom compared that to the
[1:05:38] church ages he said that they would try
[1:05:40] to bind the Catholic church but he would
[1:05:42] raise up a Martin Luther that would
[1:05:44] break the cord then they would try to
[1:05:47] bind the Lutheran church but he would
[1:05:48] raise up a John Wesley that would break
[1:05:50] the cord amen and he would try to they'd
[1:05:53] get bound again but he'd raise up a
[1:05:55] pentac costal group that would break the
[1:05:57] cord but brother brandom said that that
[1:05:59] those same things would begin to bind
[1:06:01] the Pentecostal church and and what it
[1:06:03] reminds me of is it reminds me of those
[1:06:05] four bugs of death that brother brandom
[1:06:08] talks about coming in to eat the tree
[1:06:10] the tree of life and they started to
[1:06:13] come in and they would eat the leaves
[1:06:14] and and they would eat the fruits and
[1:06:16] then they would eat the bark but what
[1:06:18] were they really trying to get to
[1:06:19] Brother David they were trying to get to
[1:06:21] the lifeline of the tree they were
[1:06:23] trying to get to where the sap belonged
[1:06:25] because they were trying to get to the
[1:06:27] heart of the tree that they might kill
[1:06:29] it anden and and all throughout the ages
[1:06:31] they would try to come against
[1:06:33] justification and sanctification and
[1:06:35] they would realize that that there's
[1:06:36] there's something deeper than that and
[1:06:39] and all throughout the and Satan trying
[1:06:41] to get in and get to that strength anden
[1:06:43] so that's what Delilah would do to
[1:06:45] Samson she would start eating away at
[1:06:47] them and eating away and eating away
[1:06:49] until eventually Samson would give his
[1:06:51] heart to Delilah amen he had given his
[1:06:54] strength to God but he gave his heart to
[1:06:56] Delilah and Delilah discovered where his
[1:06:59] great strength laid he said I have been
[1:07:02] a Nazarite since my birth he said he
[1:07:05] said uh uh uh he said uh uh there's
[1:07:07] never come a razor upon my head and I've
[1:07:10] been a Nazarite to God from my mother's
[1:07:12] womb and if I be shaven then will my
[1:07:16] strength go from me and I shall become
[1:07:19] weak and be like any other man and so
[1:07:22] Delila called upon the the those men and
[1:07:25] they come in and shave those Seven Locks
[1:07:28] during the night and this time when she
[1:07:30] made the call Samson the Philistines be
[1:07:33] upon the he tried to get up and break
[1:07:36] free from those cords but he couldn't
[1:07:38] break free and and he wish not that the
[1:07:40] Lord had departed from him amen he he he
[1:07:44] no longer had the strength to meet the
[1:07:46] challenge of the hour amen but but but
[1:07:48] but when he stood up that time amen
[1:07:50] there was something that he couldn't
[1:07:52] break free from those bands because the
[1:07:54] Lord had Departed from him when he broke
[1:07:56] that Nazarite vow and mean he still had
[1:07:59] all of his natural muscles his framework
[1:08:02] was still the same but when the Lord
[1:08:04] departed he couldn't meet the challenge
[1:08:06] of the hour and me brother Brandon would
[1:08:08] speak about the they're building bigger
[1:08:10] churches and and they're getting bigger
[1:08:12] numbers and they're getting better
[1:08:14] dressed preachers and and with with
[1:08:16] curly hair and stand up there and and
[1:08:19] and be so elegant and so pretty amen but
[1:08:21] the Lord had departed from them and
[1:08:24] their strength had gone from them amen
[1:08:27] when they broke that vow with the Lord
[1:08:29] amen because you see something um
[1:08:31] brother Aaron amen you could stand up
[1:08:34] here this morning with all the muscles
[1:08:36] that you have am me and and you do
[1:08:38] Sports so you probably have to train and
[1:08:40] you probably build quite a bit a good
[1:08:42] strong muscle amen but if there was no
[1:08:44] life in your body amen you just stand up
[1:08:47] here at just a pile of bones and muscle
[1:08:50] and you wouldn't be able to lift nothing
[1:08:52] you couldn't lift an ant if there was no
[1:08:54] life in you to motivate that muscle am
[1:08:56] mean and so that's how it is in the
[1:08:59] spiritual and mean if you you can have
[1:09:01] all the numbers and you can have all the
[1:09:03] pews and you can have all the the
[1:09:05] million dooll buildings and beautiful
[1:09:07] things but if there's no Spirit there to
[1:09:09] motivate it and mean it's just a dead
[1:09:12] church amen it's just a dead Creed or or
[1:09:15] or Dogma amen and Samson here realizing
[1:09:19] that his strength wasn't enough to do it
[1:09:22] he's here realizing that the strength
[1:09:24] that he has Isn't Enough enough amen he
[1:09:27] begin to realize that just knowing all
[1:09:29] the quotes wasn't enough Samson begins
[1:09:32] to come into a condition of weakness and
[1:09:34] begins to realize that that just sitting
[1:09:36] in a message Pew isn't enough amen and
[1:09:40] but he realized something and that the
[1:09:42] mechanics wouldn't be enough but it
[1:09:44] would take a Dynamics to come upon the
[1:09:46] mechanics amen amen that it wouldn't
[1:09:49] just be enough to have the the mechanics
[1:09:51] but he would have to have the Dynamics
[1:09:54] amen is that right right this morning
[1:09:56] that that's what the church needed and
[1:09:58] all of its mechanics but we needed the
[1:10:01] Dynamics to come upon the church to make
[1:10:03] it live Amen to make that car start and
[1:10:06] take us where we needed to go amen it's
[1:10:09] going to take the word and the spirit
[1:10:12] and mean and and neither is it just
[1:10:14] enough to have the Dynamics me but
[1:10:16] brother Bron would say if I could ever
[1:10:18] get the fundamentalists and the
[1:10:19] Pentecostals together and mean because
[1:10:21] the fundamentalists know who they are
[1:10:23] and the Pentecostals have this great
[1:10:25] faith but if I could ever get him
[1:10:27] together amen look what look what God
[1:10:30] could do amen but he'll get them
[1:10:32] together in a bride amen she'll be both
[1:10:35] mechanics and Dynamics amen she'll have
[1:10:38] the word and spirit amen just like that
[1:10:41] shunamite woman when she come into
[1:10:43] contact with the Elijah Ministry she was
[1:10:45] in great disarray but when Elijah come
[1:10:48] into contact and she took care of Elijah
[1:10:51] anden God so blessed her that the cruci
[1:10:54] of oil would never run out in the barrel
[1:10:56] of meal would never run dry but she
[1:10:59] would have a word and spirit diet that
[1:11:01] would keep her all the way until the
[1:11:03] rain fell again upon the Earth and God
[1:11:05] has given this bride a word and a Spirit
[1:11:08] Revival and me it's spiritual food and
[1:11:11] due season it'll keep you until the
[1:11:13] Rapture and mean it'll give you what you
[1:11:15] have need of to get out of here if
[1:11:17] you'll just feed on the diet of the word
[1:11:19] of God and the spirit of God for you see
[1:11:22] God is a spirit amen but in the
[1:11:24] beginning was the word and the Word was
[1:11:27] with God and the Word was God anden you
[1:11:30] see God isn't just a dead letter but the
[1:11:32] Holy Ghost is the spirit of the word and
[1:11:36] when the spirit of the word comes into
[1:11:38] your life oh it won't just be it won't
[1:11:41] just be an empty anointing it won't just
[1:11:44] be an empty power but it'll be an
[1:11:47] anointing that will line you up with
[1:11:49] every word of this Bible it'll bring to
[1:11:51] pass the manifestation of sons that the
[1:11:54] world is GR moaning for Amen brother
[1:11:56] Aaron it'll fulfill exactly what's been
[1:12:00] prophesied over this
[1:12:02] bride but but the church rejected it and
[1:12:05] mean the church refused it and I can
[1:12:08] only imagine that this is the first time
[1:12:11] that Samson has ever felt fear I can
[1:12:14] only imagine that all of his life that
[1:12:17] Nazarite vow had been hanging over him
[1:12:20] brother Brian but here he comes into
[1:12:22] condition and I can imagine it's
[1:12:24] probably the first time he he's ever
[1:12:26] felt what it's like to be afraid the
[1:12:28] first time he he's ever felt what it's
[1:12:30] like Amen to suffer defeat and and not
[1:12:34] know and fear for the future and fear
[1:12:37] that the Lord was no longer on his side
[1:12:40] because he had forsaken his vow with the
[1:12:43] Lord you see his long hair was a
[1:12:46] Nazarite vow it was a sign of
[1:12:49] consecration brother B said long hair is
[1:12:52] a Nazarite vow it shows that you've cut
[1:12:54] yourself from the world to obey the
[1:12:57] word he would say long hair was a
[1:12:59] Nazarite vow of Samson but he would also
[1:13:02] say that a hair to a woman is a Nazarite
[1:13:05] vow just like the hair was to Samson and
[1:13:08] when a woman cuts off her hair she
[1:13:10] denies or Nazarite vow that she is a
[1:13:13] bride to Christ brother BR said a
[1:13:15] Nazarite is one that is consecrated for
[1:13:18] a purpose and Samson was consecrated to
[1:13:21] an age and a purpose so he had long hair
[1:13:24] and the woman that that's a child of God
[1:13:26] lets her hair grow to show that she's
[1:13:28] consecrated to every word of God brother
[1:13:32] BR said if she cuts it off I don't care
[1:13:34] how much she dances or sings in the
[1:13:36] choir or speaks in tongues or runs up
[1:13:38] and down or has all kind of Aid
[1:13:41] societies brother Brandon said she is
[1:13:43] dead that's thus saith the Lord the word
[1:13:46] of God 1 Corinthians 14 she denied her
[1:13:49] Nazarite vow and sold out to the God of
[1:13:52] this Modern Age and mean we see how
[1:13:54] brother would begin even to speak that
[1:13:56] that Pentecostal group was getting bound
[1:13:59] up with the same thing and me thinking
[1:14:01] that just because they spoke in tongues
[1:14:03] it was enough amen but there was nothing
[1:14:06] in them and they begin to chop off their
[1:14:08] hair they begin to put on garments that
[1:14:10] pertain to a man and they begin to shave
[1:14:12] off their Nazarite vow and me and me
[1:14:15] thinking that that it would that that
[1:14:17] that just because that maybe they did a
[1:14:19] certain thing that it was enough but but
[1:14:21] they only accepted part of the word but
[1:14:24] they rejected a message that would bring
[1:14:26] them to an adoption amen they rejected
[1:14:28] the adoption they rejected the word that
[1:14:31] would place them positionally in their
[1:14:33] land and and they refused it when it
[1:14:36] came oh my and they begin to brother
[1:14:39] brand would say committing spiritual
[1:14:40] fornications he said any word in the
[1:14:43] Bible That's rejected or if any
[1:14:45] self-interpretation is put to it it's
[1:14:48] absolutely rejecting and committing
[1:14:50] adultery against the god that is your
[1:14:52] husband amen Amen brother brother
[1:14:55] brother Brandon would begin to show us
[1:14:57] am mean that there is a bride and she is
[1:15:00] vowed to Christ and he said uh he said a
[1:15:03] woman shouldn't even wink at another man
[1:15:06] he said she shouldn't show any emotions
[1:15:08] towards another man and mean she
[1:15:09] shouldn't even wink because you know
[1:15:11] what the problem is it starts with a
[1:15:13] wink and then all of a sudden it it goes
[1:15:17] to a little text message it begins to
[1:15:20] escalate a little farther and and you
[1:15:22] find out that you're in a position that
[1:15:24] you that you ever thought you would be
[1:15:26] in me but it started with a wink and
[1:15:28] mean and now we're talking about
[1:15:29] spiritually now sometimes it starts with
[1:15:32] just a wink amen with with a false
[1:15:34] Doctrine or a false Spirit am me you
[1:15:37] just you just you just look at a website
[1:15:39] say I just want to see what this is all
[1:15:40] about and me I I don't believe it but I
[1:15:43] just want to know what it's all about
[1:15:45] and all of a sudden you begin to think
[1:15:46] oh I wonder I wonder I wonder if that
[1:15:49] fining boy ever did raise I wonder if
[1:15:51] that bridge ever did fall and you
[1:15:53] realize that the Lord has departed from
[1:15:56] you and you no longer have the strength
[1:15:58] that you once had and may because you
[1:16:00] begin to to to to wink at that that
[1:16:03] spirit and you find yourself in the lap
[1:16:05] of Satan amen and you no longer have
[1:16:07] your strength am me because you forsaken
[1:16:10] your Nazarite vow and you begin to shave
[1:16:12] away this word and shave away that word
[1:16:15] and shave away this quote and shave away
[1:16:18] this scripture and you begin to realize
[1:16:20] Lord where have you gone and that's
[1:16:22] where the denominations found themselves
[1:16:24] when brother Brandon was here he would
[1:16:26] begin to call out an indictment against
[1:16:28] them and say eobot is written on the
[1:16:30] door the presence of the Lord has to
[1:16:33] parted and me because you begin to shave
[1:16:35] off Luther's words and shave off
[1:16:37] Wesley's words and now you stand as a
[1:16:40] Shor as a Shor sister he would say a me
[1:16:43] where God gave you the word to be your
[1:16:45] strength but you begin to shave off this
[1:16:47] lock and shave off that lock and you
[1:16:50] stand without strength and me and he
[1:16:52] would begin to even rebuke the
[1:16:54] Pentecostals and even his own Tabernacle
[1:16:57] he would say brandom Tabernacle worldism
[1:16:59] is creeping in he said have you gave up
[1:17:02] your secret that you once had when you
[1:17:04] were wallowing in the sawdust and now
[1:17:07] the discernment of hearts are taking
[1:17:09] place and you sit there and you think my
[1:17:11] that's that's pretty good that's all
[1:17:13] right that and you sit there and he
[1:17:15] would begin to rebuke them and say
[1:17:16] worldly ism is creeping in amen and and
[1:17:19] your strength is departing from you amen
[1:17:22] but he would begin to speak about letter
[1:17:24] be free amen if she has the spirit let
[1:17:27] her alone amen and God has called us to
[1:17:31] a freedom in this message amen he's
[1:17:33] called us out of the chains of
[1:17:36] denominationalism and I say let her stay
[1:17:38] free amen let this bride stay free amen
[1:17:42] amen amen just because you sit in the
[1:17:44] message Pew that's not where your
[1:17:45] freedom lays but your freedom lays in
[1:17:48] the message himself which is Christ that
[1:17:51] the Lord has descended in this last hour
[1:17:54] in the strength has descended back into
[1:17:56] the church and I say let her stay free
[1:17:59] amen if we have to Worship in ten Pan
[1:18:01] Alley let us stay free and mean if our
[1:18:04] young people have to boohoo and snot all
[1:18:06] over the altar to get an experience with
[1:18:08] the Living God then I say let us stay
[1:18:11] free oh my if a move of God ever becomes
[1:18:14] a bad thing around this message we'll go
[1:18:16] out into the Wilderness amen we'll cry
[1:18:19] out with the rocks and the trees but we
[1:18:21] will not give up our strength to any
[1:18:23] spirit any devil we will not give up our
[1:18:26] anointing we will not give up anything
[1:18:29] that this Prophet taught oh my if it
[1:18:32] becomes a shameful thing to quote this
[1:18:34] Prophet then I'll go out into the
[1:18:36] Wilderness and I'll live on the
[1:18:37] riverbank but I will not forsake the
[1:18:40] strength of my life amen because when
[1:18:42] you find yourself in a trial you don't
[1:18:44] want to realize that your strength has
[1:18:47] departed and your Nazarite vow has been
[1:18:49] broken oh but I tell you when I find
[1:18:52] myself in a trial I want to know that
[1:18:54] the Lord is the strength of my life I
[1:18:56] want to know that the anointing of the
[1:18:58] Lord is able to rescue me because I know
[1:19:01] I don't have enough strength in myself
[1:19:04] oh oh brother Brandon would begin to
[1:19:06] even cry out hurt not the oil and the
[1:19:08] wine touch not my anointed don't you
[1:19:11] touch that oil of the Holy Ghost don't
[1:19:13] you touch that stimulation of Revelation
[1:19:16] oh don't touch my children don't touch
[1:19:19] my free bride oh we've got the oil
[1:19:22] brother and sister and we've got the
[1:19:24] wine and we're free in the Holy Ghost oh
[1:19:27] don't shave off one lock if you just
[1:19:29] stay with the message and me it'll keep
[1:19:32] you in the hour of trouble am mean this
[1:19:34] message is the strength of my life am
[1:19:36] mean this message is what will get us in
[1:19:39] a Rapture oh God's not looking for
[1:19:42] separators or God's not looking for
[1:19:44] mixers God's looking for
[1:19:47] separators you see a Nazarite is one
[1:19:49] that's consecrated for a purpose am me
[1:19:52] and if you don't devote yourself for if
[1:19:54] you don't devote yourself to something I
[1:19:56] mean what are you going to do are you
[1:19:58] just going to go around like a piece of
[1:20:00] Driftwood and think one day this is
[1:20:02] right and the next day this is right
[1:20:04] amen but God's got a Nazarite bride Amen
[1:20:07] in this bright age he's got a Nazarite
[1:20:10] bride that is consecrated to an age and
[1:20:13] a purpose and me we're consecrated to
[1:20:15] this age and we're consecrated to the
[1:20:18] purpose amen you are a separated people
[1:20:21] you are not like the denominations I
[1:20:23] hope they don't offend anybody but
[1:20:25] you're different and mean you are not
[1:20:27] the same we are not the same as the
[1:20:29] Methodist we are not the same as the
[1:20:31] Lutheran we are a called out people we
[1:20:34] are a separated people holy onto the
[1:20:37] Lord Brother Brandon would say come out
[1:20:39] from among them and be ye separate touch
[1:20:41] not their unclean thing we've been
[1:20:43] called out from that mess to a freedom
[1:20:46] and a liberty oh oh I'm so thankful that
[1:20:50] brother brandom came on the scene and
[1:20:51] told the truth and man he would say he
[1:20:54] would say brother BR even talking about
[1:20:55] cutting their hair he would say maybe
[1:20:57] sometimes M ministers hasn't got nerve
[1:20:59] enough to tell you he said this is one
[1:21:01] time you're going to hear it oh and he
[1:21:03] would begin to cry out against that
[1:21:05] Jezebel system he would begin to cry out
[1:21:08] against makeup and cry out against all
[1:21:10] these things and mean and I believe we
[1:21:12] still need man and to tell the truth I
[1:21:15] believe we still need people that'll
[1:21:17] stand up for the truth and mean I
[1:21:19] believe we can still call black black
[1:21:22] and white white and me I believe our
[1:21:24] young man can still dress like young man
[1:21:26] I believe our young sisters can still
[1:21:28] dress like young sisters and me we're
[1:21:30] not here to mix with this world we're
[1:21:33] not here to give into the peer pressures
[1:21:35] amen I I I know it's a lot of pressure
[1:21:38] amen for our young people to go into the
[1:21:39] schools and things but God has given us
[1:21:42] a spirit to withstand the pressures of
[1:21:44] the age and stand there as a witness if
[1:21:47] you're the only one stand stand alone
[1:21:50] for the message of the hour stand for
[1:21:52] the word of God stand for the spirit of
[1:21:55] God Amen don't bow down now amen don't
[1:21:57] give into the pressures now am mean
[1:21:59] we're just now close to home this is the
[1:22:02] time to stand like never before Oh and
[1:22:05] there's more for you than there is
[1:22:07] against you brother Shane if you'll
[1:22:08] stand for the Lord he'll stand for you
[1:22:11] and there'll be more for you than
[1:22:13] anything that comes against you and me
[1:22:15] in the hour of trouble you'll realize
[1:22:17] that there's a host of angels encamped
[1:22:19] round about you to see you through to
[1:22:21] Victory oh he's the god he's the god
[1:22:25] that we serve oh but the problem is
[1:22:30] brother man say let they let down the
[1:22:31] bars they let down the bars they
[1:22:33] compromis with sin let down the bars the
[1:22:37] Sheep got out but how did the goats get
[1:22:39] in he would say they let down the bars
[1:22:42] they begin to compromise just a little
[1:22:44] word here and a little word there and
[1:22:47] they realize that their that their
[1:22:49] pasture is full of goats oh and the
[1:22:53] sheep have gotten out
[1:22:55] and they might have a bigger
[1:22:56] congregation but it's a Congregation of
[1:22:58] goats and not of sheep oh they let down
[1:23:02] the
[1:23:03] bars you know I've got a little boy and
[1:23:06] and he's 14 months old so if any of you
[1:23:09] have had children you know what that's
[1:23:12] like and and he is getting into
[1:23:15] everything Oh my he gets into a c i mean
[1:23:19] you can't turn your head Harley and he's
[1:23:21] doing something getting into the
[1:23:23] cabinets and the cabinets out the
[1:23:24] cabinets is a big one because we don't
[1:23:26] have them locked so we probably should
[1:23:28] just lock them but we don't have them
[1:23:30] locked so every time he tries to get
[1:23:32] into them we have to get on to them and
[1:23:34] so we say you can't do that buddy and
[1:23:36] we'll go and we'll maybe give him a
[1:23:38] little SWAT and then he'll he they don't
[1:23:40] do nothing I mean you you don't want to
[1:23:44] hit him that hard but he just don't care
[1:23:47] he so he goes right back to there and
[1:23:50] after about the 50th time it would be
[1:23:53] easy to give up and just say okay buddy
[1:23:56] whatever you have rule of this home you
[1:23:59] you have rule of this place you you get
[1:24:02] into the cabinets go ahead and stick
[1:24:05] something in the outlet I don't care
[1:24:07] mean but what type of home would that
[1:24:08] produce mean if you just gave up and
[1:24:11] compromised and let him have rule over
[1:24:13] the home and and and what type of home
[1:24:16] will it produce if you start letting
[1:24:18] down the bars and letting a little bit
[1:24:21] of of this creep in and a little bit of
[1:24:23] that creep in am me and you don't want
[1:24:25] to take a stand against it amen because
[1:24:27] it takes effort and it takes it takes it
[1:24:31] takes sometimes a little bit of
[1:24:33] uncomfortableness Amen to stand up
[1:24:35] against something amen but but but
[1:24:38] sometimes you get to the place like
[1:24:39] Samson where you say just once more Lord
[1:24:42] I want my strength back I want my home
[1:24:45] back I want my family back I want my
[1:24:48] wife back I'm tired of this devil having
[1:24:51] full rain over my home but Lord forgive
[1:24:54] me for I've compromised forgive me Lord
[1:24:56] for I let down the bars but Lord restore
[1:24:59] unto me the strength that I once had
[1:25:03] hallelujah
[1:25:04] amen amen it would behoove us to not
[1:25:09] forsake the strength of our life am me
[1:25:13] if a man forsakes to walk in the
[1:25:15] sunlight he'll get
[1:25:17] weak and it shows that there's something
[1:25:19] mentally wrong with him when a man would
[1:25:22] go hide himself down in a cellar
[1:25:25] and refuse to walk in the sunlight that
[1:25:27] would give him strength and before long
[1:25:30] he'll become anemic he'll become weak
[1:25:33] and and and because he forsook it and
[1:25:35] brother random would say that you know
[1:25:36] if we forsake to walk in the light of
[1:25:38] the Lord if we forsake to walk in God's
[1:25:41] sunlight if we forsake the Holy Spirit
[1:25:44] if we forsake our prayer life amen you
[1:25:47] start to realize that you're getting
[1:25:50] weak amen but but we shouldn't refuse is
[1:25:54] the Lord that is our strength and and
[1:25:57] when
[1:25:58] Samson before we move on the thing about
[1:26:02] Samson amen Samson had had had forsaken
[1:26:06] his vow amen he say why are we so strong
[1:26:11] you talk about cutting your hair you
[1:26:12] talk about makeup why is it so strong
[1:26:16] because we're under a Nazarite vow amen
[1:26:19] and when Moses was Vindicated by the
[1:26:21] pillar of fire and mean shortly after he
[1:26:24] would begin to write don't you add one
[1:26:26] word or take one word from that which I
[1:26:28] have spoken unto you amen and there
[1:26:30] would come brother brandom Vindicated by
[1:26:32] a pillar of fire and he would say so say
[1:26:34] unto you don't you add one word don't
[1:26:37] you take from word you just say what's
[1:26:39] set on those tapes oh that's why we're
[1:26:42] under Nazarite vow I mean if you shave
[1:26:45] one word you'll find yourself in trouble
[1:26:47] I mean you I'd say this you don't even
[1:26:51] have to break out the scissors you can
[1:26:53] leave them in the ch for because when
[1:26:55] God gave us this message it was a
[1:26:57] perfect message amen amen legalism was
[1:27:00] already shaved off of this message I
[1:27:02] mean fanaticism was already shaved off
[1:27:05] of this message I mean and as Ministers
[1:27:07] of the Living Word of God and mean it's
[1:27:10] not my job to try to make it right it's
[1:27:12] already perfect it's only our job to
[1:27:15] give it to God's children in the purity
[1:27:18] of the word that the strength of it
[1:27:20] might come into their lives and produce
[1:27:22] an overcoming and amen but the but the
[1:27:25] but the hope that we have brother
[1:27:27] Brandon would begin to say is that while
[1:27:30] Samson was in that condition a new shock
[1:27:32] begin to grow backen and those Seven
[1:27:35] Locks amen begin to come back upon his
[1:27:38] head amen and brother Brandon would say
[1:27:41] now
[1:27:42] notice at the opening of The Seven Seals
[1:27:45] Revelations 10 the full word is to be
[1:27:47] born into manifestation again and
[1:27:50] Vindicated by the spirit of God in the
[1:27:52] full strength as it was when he was here
[1:27:55] on Earth manifested in the same way
[1:27:58] doing the same things that it did when
[1:28:00] he it was here on Earth amen Jesus
[1:28:03] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:28:06] forever oh I will restore saith the Lord
[1:28:11] amen amen it can look pretty dark but
[1:28:15] God has restored the strength to his
[1:28:18] bride amen he will have a bride that
[1:28:22] will stand in strength in honor and
[1:28:26] glory and she will not refuse the
[1:28:29] leadership of the Holy
[1:28:31] Ghost but you see those children of
[1:28:33] Israel got to a place one time where
[1:28:36] they looked out at that Philistine Army
[1:28:39] and they seen Kings leading them into
[1:28:41] battle and they thought my wouldn't it
[1:28:45] be nice to have a king like that to lead
[1:28:48] us into battle wouldn't it be nice and
[1:28:51] you see God was going to give him that
[1:28:53] and the man Christ Jesus but they begin
[1:28:56] to go ahead of the word and they think
[1:28:58] we want somebody like that to lead us
[1:29:00] into battle and Samuel Samuel's heart
[1:29:03] begin to break and they would say Samuel
[1:29:06] you've always been faithful you've
[1:29:07] always been good to us it's nothing
[1:29:09] against you it's just that we want a
[1:29:11] king to lead us into battle and Samuel
[1:29:14] was a prophet with the word of God but
[1:29:16] they begin to desire natural leadership
[1:29:19] to lead him in battle they said we still
[1:29:21] want the priest blowing the horns we
[1:29:23] still want we still want all of the
[1:29:25] order and all of the all of the form
[1:29:27] it's just that we want a natural
[1:29:30] leadership and when they begin to push
[1:29:32] out the leadership of the Holy Ghost for
[1:29:34] the natural leadership and mean it was
[1:29:37] just like Samson cutting off his hair
[1:29:39] and mean because Samson without that
[1:29:41] hair was just like any other man and
[1:29:44] this church was just without that
[1:29:46] leadership of the Holy Ghost was was
[1:29:48] just another church it's just like the
[1:29:50] world with God's name attached to it and
[1:29:53] so so there in this condition they begin
[1:29:56] to reject the king of Israel and begin
[1:29:59] to accept Saul as their King and so it's
[1:30:04] significant to me when David writes this
[1:30:07] the Lord is the strength of my life
[1:30:10] because as we begin to place ourselves
[1:30:11] in the picture that David was in amen
[1:30:15] Saul begins to become Anointed The King
[1:30:17] over
[1:30:19] Israel and in 1st Samuel 15 it's written
[1:30:23] of the the the story and so Samuel is
[1:30:26] sent to anoint Saul King over Israel and
[1:30:29] when Saul begins to rise to this
[1:30:31] position and Samuel comes in to anoint
[1:30:34] him and he he begins to say hearken onto
[1:30:37] the voice of the words of the Lord and
[1:30:39] Samuel begins to command them to go and
[1:30:41] smite amalec amen and destroy everything
[1:30:45] and spare them not and so Saul gathers
[1:30:48] the Army and lays in weight and and he
[1:30:50] begins to begins to get things in order
[1:30:53] for battle and begins to dismiss the
[1:30:55] kenites that were in the land because he
[1:30:58] didn't want them to get caught up in it
[1:31:00] amen because they uh from what I
[1:31:02] understand they had been good to Israel
[1:31:04] and so he he began to dismiss them and
[1:31:07] and and he lays in weit and when the
[1:31:09] amalekites come in the army of Saul
[1:31:12] begins to rise up and smite the
[1:31:15] amalekites amen and and they took King
[1:31:18] AAG alive in the best of the animals
[1:31:22] amen and and and when he did this the
[1:31:25] Lord repented that he had ever made Saul
[1:31:28] King because he didn't perform the
[1:31:30] Commandments of the Lord that the Lord
[1:31:33] had given him and it Grieves Samuel and
[1:31:36] Samuel came to Saul and man and just
[1:31:38] paraphrasing this it's powerful if you
[1:31:40] want to go read it but but Samuel begins
[1:31:43] to come to Saul and Saul says I have
[1:31:45] performed the Lord's commandment but
[1:31:47] then Samuel begins to say then then why
[1:31:50] can I hear sheep
[1:31:51] bleeding and why can I hear ox and lo if
[1:31:55] you perform my commandment then what is
[1:31:58] the sound and and Saul would begin Saul
[1:32:02] you see Saul would begin to explain that
[1:32:05] they kept him for
[1:32:06] sacrifice but you're all familiar with
[1:32:08] the scripture how obedience is better
[1:32:11] than sacrifice and that comes out of
[1:32:13] this this text here because Saul was
[1:32:16] supposed to kill everything and it would
[1:32:18] have been better if he would have just
[1:32:19] obeyed the Lord than to take to take him
[1:32:22] for sacrifices
[1:32:24] it would have been better if he would
[1:32:25] have killed King AAG than to keep him
[1:32:29] and to keep the animals for sacrifice
[1:32:32] and and so Samuel begins to tell him I
[1:32:34] will tell you what the Lord has said and
[1:32:37] he says when thou was little in thine
[1:32:38] own sight in verse 17 was thou not made
[1:32:41] the head of the tribes of Israel and the
[1:32:44] Lord anointed thee King over Israel and
[1:32:47] he says sa when you were little in your
[1:32:49] own sight you were exalted and mean but
[1:32:52] you see as we said before Saul fell
[1:32:56] because of popularity and he began to
[1:32:58] listen to the voice of the people
[1:33:00] instead of the voice of the Lord amen
[1:33:03] and he finds himself in a condition amen
[1:33:06] where the Lord you see uh we are just
[1:33:11] because the Lord has chosen us that's
[1:33:13] where our strength comes from but I'm
[1:33:16] aware that if the Lord would ever take
[1:33:18] his hand off of my life brother Dave I'm
[1:33:20] just like 84 cents of dust and C
[1:33:24] I have no good thing I brought nothing
[1:33:27] into this world and I'll take nothing
[1:33:29] out of this world brother Brandon said
[1:33:32] he would even see people have an
[1:33:33] experience with the Holy Ghost and get
[1:33:35] out on the field and totally deny it
[1:33:38] because of popularity amen amen but but
[1:33:42] we are not that big amen if you get to
[1:33:45] thinking you are big enough to have your
[1:33:47] own Ministry or have your own position
[1:33:50] amen you you got to come back and
[1:33:51] realize amen that you're that the only
[1:33:54] reason that you've been exalted to this
[1:33:57] position is the Lord anden and it's the
[1:34:00] Lord only that's the only good thing
[1:34:02] about me is the Lord it it's his
[1:34:06] election in my life amen and so Saul
[1:34:09] Samuel comes to Saul and says you know
[1:34:11] why didn't you obey and and and he
[1:34:14] Samuel begins to lay the news on to him
[1:34:17] in verse 23 he says because thou Hast
[1:34:19] rejected the L word of the Lord he H has
[1:34:23] also rejected Ed thee from being King
[1:34:25] and and and and and so Samuel said unto
[1:34:29] Saul Saul said I pray thee pardon my sin
[1:34:32] and turn again with me that I may
[1:34:33] Worship the Lord in verse 26 it says
[1:34:36] Samuel said unto Saul I will not return
[1:34:38] unto thee for thou Hast rejected the
[1:34:41] word of the Lord and the Lord hath
[1:34:43] rejected thee from being King over
[1:34:44] Israel and Samuel turned to go away and
[1:34:47] he laid hold upon the skirt of his
[1:34:49] mantle and it ran and Samuel said unto
[1:34:51] him the Lord hath rent the kingdom of
[1:34:53] Israel from thee this day and has given
[1:34:56] it unto a neighbor of thine that is
[1:34:58] better than thou and me you see now how
[1:35:01] David writes this the Lord is the
[1:35:03] strength of my life we're seeing a
[1:35:05] transfer now amen from the from from
[1:35:08] Saul to David Amen in in verse 29 it
[1:35:11] said and also the strength of Israel
[1:35:13] will not lie nor repent for he is not a
[1:35:16] man that he should repent amen and there
[1:35:20] on that scene Saul uh had forsaken the
[1:35:24] Lord and Samuel took his sword and
[1:35:26] Samuel come up to King AAG and in the
[1:35:29] presence of the Lord he slayed King AAG
[1:35:33] and he said because your sword has made
[1:35:35] mothers childless I will make your
[1:35:38] mother childless and he slew King AAG in
[1:35:41] the presence of the Lord I mean that may
[1:35:43] sound pretty strong but it was the
[1:35:46] obedience to the word of the Lord that's
[1:35:48] what Saul should have done in the first
[1:35:50] place amen amen but Samuel was obedient
[1:35:53] to the the Lord and here comes David on
[1:35:55] the scene and in Psalms 52 it it's a
[1:35:59] Psalm of David talking about when doag
[1:36:02] the Edomite came and told Saul and so
[1:36:04] and so in verse 7 it says
[1:36:06] lo this is the man that made not God of
[1:36:10] strength but trusted in the abundance of
[1:36:12] his riches and strengthened himself in
[1:36:15] his wickedness but I am like a green
[1:36:18] olive tree in the house of God oh I
[1:36:21] trust in the mercy of God forever ever
[1:36:23] and ever you see David was a man of
[1:36:26] Small Beginnings as well and me David
[1:36:28] was taken from the Sheep coat and made a
[1:36:31] a shepherd and a sheep coat to the king
[1:36:34] uh uh to a king in Israel you see David
[1:36:37] was a man of Small Beginnings but the
[1:36:39] difference was David didn't forget where
[1:36:41] his strength came from and me and I'm
[1:36:44] trying to draw a picture here David did
[1:36:46] not forget in the in his mistakes and
[1:36:49] his failures that his strength came from
[1:36:51] the Lord amen but his strength was the
[1:36:54] strength of Israel and mean in the book
[1:36:57] of Isaiah it would talk about how some
[1:36:59] TR about the strength of pharaoh and
[1:37:02] some trust in the shadows of Egypt amen
[1:37:05] but but it said therefore shall the
[1:37:07] strength of pharaoh be your shame in the
[1:37:10] Trust In the shadow of Egypt your
[1:37:13] confusion but David would write some
[1:37:15] trust in chariots and some trust in
[1:37:18] horses but but but we will not forget
[1:37:21] the name of the but we will remember the
[1:37:23] name name of the Lord Our God Amen do
[1:37:25] you see David's attitude some trust in
[1:37:28] the strength of pharaoh some trust in
[1:37:31] chariots and some trust in horses amen
[1:37:35] and some trust in Psychology oh and some
[1:37:38] trust in big churches and some trust and
[1:37:41] education but we will not forget the
[1:37:44] name of the Lord Our God oh my we will
[1:37:47] not forget where our strength comes from
[1:37:49] and in verse 29 it talked about the
[1:37:52] strength of Israel
[1:37:54] will not lie and it will not repent and
[1:37:57] me and that word strength is the only
[1:37:59] time in the Bible that it's capital S
[1:38:02] because that speaks to me that it is not
[1:38:05] speaking of the strength of Egypt it is
[1:38:07] not speaking of the strength of pharaoh
[1:38:09] but the reason it would be a capital S
[1:38:11] is because the strength of Israel is the
[1:38:14] Lord himself and mean it speaks to me
[1:38:17] that there is a deity that followed
[1:38:19] along and led the children of Israel and
[1:38:22] that was the strength of David's life
[1:38:25] that when he would write the Lord is the
[1:38:27] strength of my life he was speaking of a
[1:38:29] capital S the Lord himself is the
[1:38:32] strength of my life and it's the Jesus
[1:38:35] Christ that's the same yesterday today
[1:38:37] and forever oh it's the same strength
[1:38:40] that led the children of Israel out of
[1:38:43] Egypt it's the same strength brother and
[1:38:46] sister that Caleb could say I'm just as
[1:38:48] strong now as the day Moses called me
[1:38:51] it's the same strength that would lead
[1:38:53] Joshua through the Red Sea it's the same
[1:38:55] strength that would be with Moses and
[1:38:58] Joshua and Rahab and all the all the all
[1:39:02] the heroes throughout the Bible it was
[1:39:04] the strength of Israel that was with
[1:39:06] them in the Lion's Den that was with
[1:39:08] them in the Red Sea but oh I'm so
[1:39:11] thankful that Jehovah of the Old
[1:39:13] Testament is Jesus of the new Amen in
[1:39:16] the strength of Israel crossed over into
[1:39:18] the Gentile dispensation and it's the
[1:39:21] same strength friends that came down in
[1:39:23] the upper room and filled 120 vessels
[1:39:27] it's the same strength that came into
[1:39:28] the meetings with brother random and
[1:39:30] said I take every spirit in here under
[1:39:32] my control and me we have been given a
[1:39:35] word of strength we have been given a
[1:39:37] word of anointing and it's under that
[1:39:39] word of strength that they shall lay
[1:39:41] their hands on the sick and they shall
[1:39:43] recover in my name they shall cast out
[1:39:46] Devils amen casting out Devils doesn't
[1:39:48] just have to be a great event at the
[1:39:50] front of the church but while the word
[1:39:53] Goes Forth it has enough strength to
[1:39:56] Cast Away the spirits that are haunting
[1:39:58] your life and me this message still has
[1:40:01] enough strength to to to bind the
[1:40:04] spirits of confusion that would torment
[1:40:06] your mind oh it's the word of strength
[1:40:10] that would Cast Away spirits of anxiety
[1:40:12] that would Cast Away spirits of
[1:40:14] depression that would begin to reveal to
[1:40:16] you who you are and mean it's the
[1:40:18] strength of Israel that's the strength
[1:40:21] that's accompanying this bride
[1:40:23] oh it's the strength of my
[1:40:25] life it's the strength and his strong
[1:40:28] hand still reaches down his strong hand
[1:40:31] is still here in this meeting it still
[1:40:33] reaches down the same strength that
[1:40:36] plucked you up out of the Dust of this
[1:40:37] Earth that same strength canand your
[1:40:40] broken body that same strength is the
[1:40:43] strength that heals you the strength the
[1:40:45] same strength that called you is the
[1:40:48] same strength that keeps
[1:40:49] you for the Holy Ghost isn't just
[1:40:52] ownership young people the Holy Ghost
[1:40:55] isn't just ownership but it's keeping
[1:40:57] power and the same strength that called
[1:40:59] you it'll keep you when the Holy Ghost
[1:41:03] becomes the strength of your life he
[1:41:05] didn't just call you to lose you he
[1:41:07] called you to keep you amen and it's the
[1:41:11] strength that comes in the midst of
[1:41:14] Trials you see when brother brandom
[1:41:16] stood there and his wife lay and his
[1:41:19] baby laid in that morg and the devil
[1:41:22] came to him and said you you serve God
[1:41:25] and this is what he does you mean you're
[1:41:27] going to tell me you're going to serve
[1:41:28] him night and day and he'll lift up a
[1:41:31] blanket and reject your prayer and
[1:41:33] brother Brandon was left standing
[1:41:35] between two opinions and he would say he
[1:41:37] would say he was in a place between two
[1:41:39] opinions but he was lay his hands upon
[1:41:42] that baby and say the Lord gives and the
[1:41:45] Lord takes away and blessed be the name
[1:41:47] of the Lord hallelujah he didn't forget
[1:41:50] where his strength came from but he
[1:41:52] would say the lord gave is and takes and
[1:41:54] he said I felt relief oh my that means
[1:41:57] something to me because you know what
[1:41:59] the devil will come and try to whisper
[1:42:01] in your ear that if you just give up all
[1:42:03] of this and just go out into the world
[1:42:05] that you'll have relief but I'm here to
[1:42:07] tell you it is a Lie from the pits of
[1:42:09] hell and but when brother brandom took
[1:42:11] sides with Jesus he said I felt relief
[1:42:14] and the best way to get relief in your
[1:42:16] trial is just to take sides with Jesus
[1:42:19] and say Lord you give and you take away
[1:42:22] but Blessed Be the name of the Lord Lord
[1:42:25] I remember you're the strength I
[1:42:27] remember that you brought me out before
[1:42:29] and you'll bring me out again and like
[1:42:31] job could say the Lord gives and the
[1:42:33] Lord takes away blessed be the name of
[1:42:36] the Lord he didn't question God he just
[1:42:39] praised them and say Lord I trust you oh
[1:42:43] my my wife stood there in our youth camp
[1:42:46] the other day and if you're not familiar
[1:42:48] with her situation it was
[1:42:51] a the the devil was a attacking her with
[1:42:54] with seizures I mean it was
[1:42:56] non-epileptic but he was attacking her
[1:42:58] with seizures and she stood there in
[1:43:00] that camp and in the middle of seizure
[1:43:03] sometimes we'd have to carry her out and
[1:43:05] let her come out of it and get some
[1:43:06] strength back but there she stood ready
[1:43:09] to go in the prayer line and she stood
[1:43:11] there with strength and she stood there
[1:43:14] with with a with a something in her
[1:43:15] heart that said if I could just get in
[1:43:17] that prayer line and in the middle of
[1:43:19] Caesar I would watch her and and she
[1:43:21] would just lift her hands to the the
[1:43:23] Lord and begin to praise the Lord and
[1:43:25] mean in the middle of it she would just
[1:43:26] begin to confess and praise the Lord am
[1:43:29] mean and she gotten that anointing amen
[1:43:31] and things she had been carrying were
[1:43:33] broken off of her in an instant in the
[1:43:35] presence of the Lord amen but I'm
[1:43:37] telling you there's a time in the middle
[1:43:39] of a valley oh where the best thing you
[1:43:42] can do is say the Lord gives and takes
[1:43:45] away but blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:43:48] and me I may be in a valley but he's
[1:43:50] still God he's still worthy of my praise
[1:43:53] he's still worthy of our worship amen
[1:43:56] what are you going to do in the middle
[1:43:57] of your trial I think I'll throw up my
[1:44:00] hands and start praising the Lord amen I
[1:44:03] may be in a valley but I haven't lost my
[1:44:05] praise I may be in the middle of the
[1:44:07] darkest time of my life but I tell you
[1:44:10] the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob has
[1:44:13] not departed from me but the anointing
[1:44:15] of the Lord is in the building right now
[1:44:18] to set his children free you don't have
[1:44:20] to stay where you're at you don't have
[1:44:22] to stay in that prison anymore oh you
[1:44:25] may be down but I haven't lost my praise
[1:44:29] oh Satan you can't have my worship you
[1:44:32] can't have my praise you can't have my
[1:44:35] joy oh you say I'm in a battle brother
[1:44:39] Isaac but let the joy of the Lord begin
[1:44:42] to swirl through this building and the
[1:44:45] joy of the Lord is your strength and
[1:44:47] just all of a sudden you came in here
[1:44:49] dragging your feet but in the moment you
[1:44:52] say oh my it's the joy of the Lord and
[1:44:54] it's restoring unto me oh I've just
[1:44:57] begin to fight I've just begun to fight
[1:45:00] oh where is that Philistine where is
[1:45:03] that Goliath am mean where is that
[1:45:05] cancer where is that depression where is
[1:45:08] that anxiety you are defeated because
[1:45:11] God has come on the scene and shed of
[1:45:13] blood oh he's poured out a spirit of
[1:45:16] anointing that has set a bride free and
[1:45:20] he which the son has made free is free
[1:45:22] indeed
[1:45:23] so we're not going to look at the
[1:45:26] obstacles if you're looking at the
[1:45:28] obstacles you're looking at the wrong
[1:45:29] thing but brother Brandon would say we
[1:45:31] get Joy by looking at the word and so if
[1:45:34] you stopped looking at the word and
[1:45:36] started looking at the obstacle that
[1:45:38] might be why you lost your joy but look
[1:45:41] back to the promise and by his stripes
[1:45:43] you are already healed so why don't you
[1:45:46] praise him like you're already healed
[1:45:48] why don't you worship him like you're
[1:45:49] already delivered because it's just as
[1:45:52] sure to happen
[1:45:53] as the word of the Lord because his word
[1:45:56] cannot fail oh he said I'll be in ever
[1:45:59] presentent help in the time of trouble
[1:46:01] I'll be the Lily in your Valley I'll be
[1:46:03] the Opium I'll be the rose of Sharon I
[1:46:07] will not leave you nor forsake you oh
[1:46:09] you say Lord I'm afraid I made a mistake
[1:46:13] Lord I'm afraid that you're going to
[1:46:15] forsake me but oh David would write lord

[1:46:24] heaven you're there if I make my bed in
[1:46:26] hell you're there oh Hallelujah I'm
[1:46:30] talking about an everpresent God Amen
[1:46:32] Saul was rejected but David as a man
[1:46:37] after God's Own Heart would write surely
[1:46:39] goodness and mercy follow me all the
[1:46:42] days of my life and God would begin to
[1:46:44] speak to David that he would bring forth
[1:46:47] the temple through his son Solomon and
[1:46:50] he wouldn't forsake Him like he did Saul
[1:46:52] it's said I will not take my mercies
[1:46:54] from I will not take my mercies from
[1:46:57] them like I did Saul oh he said I will
[1:47:00] not forsake you oh Children of the
[1:47:02] Living God you are not a Saul you are a
[1:47:06] David and in the Valley of the shadow of
[1:47:09] death his mercies have never forsaken
[1:47:11] you he's an never presentent help in the
[1:47:13] time of trouble Hallelujah he's the god
[1:47:16] of the valley we have the Mighty God for
[1:47:18] our God we worship the mighty God we
[1:47:21] worship the strength of Israel oh oh do
[1:47:25] you feel it do you feel it do you feel
[1:47:28] the presence of the Lord and then in his
[1:47:31] presence you have a right to confess the
[1:47:33] word over the situation and let the weak
[1:47:36] say I am strong let the poor say I am
[1:47:39] rich Hallelujah stop confessing your
[1:47:41] problem and start confessing the word oh
[1:47:44] let the weak say I am strong let it come
[1:47:47] out of your own lips I am strong I am
[1:47:49] strong I am free I am delivered
[1:47:53] I've got my joy back I've got my peace
[1:47:56] back I've got my children back I don't
[1:47:58] even see them yet but I've got my
[1:48:00] children back
[1:48:01] Hallelujah they belong to you go ahead
[1:48:04] and claim your children go ahead and
[1:48:06] speak for your children go ahead and
[1:48:08] speak for your loved ones I'm telling
[1:48:10] you that there is a strong arm that is
[1:48:12] able to reach out to them and pull them
[1:48:15] back into the fold of the Living God he
[1:48:17] will not lose a one of his
[1:48:19] hallelujah oh if you're oh we are in the
[1:48:23] palm of his hand and Satan can't pluck
[1:48:26] us from the palm of the hand of the
[1:48:29] strength of Israel Hallelujah said I
[1:48:32] will not lose a one of mine oh glory to
[1:48:35] God I believe right now you can go ahead
[1:48:37] and thank him for the Holy Ghost you can
[1:48:39] go ahead and praise him you can go ahead
[1:48:41] and worship Him amen he has spoken it he
[1:48:45] will perform it oh he is the strength
[1:48:48] Giver Hallelujah let the weak say I am
[1:48:52] strong
[1:48:53] let the poor say I am rich let the bound
[1:48:56] say I am free amen because the right
[1:49:00] mental attitude towards any promise of
[1:49:02] God will bring it to
[1:49:05] pass sometimes you just have to adjust
[1:49:08] your attitude that's right you're taking
[1:49:11] the wrong attitude you're taking the
[1:49:13] attitude of what you're seeing with your
[1:49:15] natural eyes but change your attitude to
[1:49:17] what you see through the eyes of faith
[1:49:20] and let your attitude adjust to the word
[1:49:23] and when you get the right mental
[1:49:24] attitude it will bring to pass every
[1:49:27] promise in this Bible amen amen friends
[1:49:30] it's time you step into your position as
[1:49:33] a son or daughter of God you don't have
[1:49:35] to keep giving in to that same devil and
[1:49:38] mean when you are a son or daughter of
[1:49:39] God I mean brother Benjamin stand in
[1:49:41] your position and don't waver to the
[1:49:43] left or right but look in the eyes of
[1:49:46] that devil and say you are
[1:49:47] [Music]
[1:49:49] defeated oh but we are oh we are going
[1:49:52] on to Glory nothing can separate us from
[1:49:55] the love of God we have the good news of

[1:50:50] refill you with the Holy Ghost he is
[1:50:52] here here to give you the desire of your
[1:50:54] heart oh break out your slingshot and
[1:50:57] say Satan I'm coming after my sheep I'm
[1:51:00] coming after
[1:51:02] you you
[1:51:05] see brother brandom had a dream one
[1:51:08] time and there was a man and a woman
[1:51:12] that was supposed to be kind of like his
[1:51:14] mother and father although it
[1:51:16] wasn't and that man had a I forget
[1:51:20] exactly what it was it was a three a
[1:51:22] three edge of Club type of thing right
[1:51:25] and brother brand
[1:51:28] said he he this this man kept beating
[1:51:31] this woman up with this club and going
[1:51:34] around real boastful proud every time
[1:51:36] she try to get up he would beat her
[1:51:40] down and brother brandom said he he knew
[1:51:44] it wasn't right but he didn't want to he
[1:51:46] didn't want to approach it at first
[1:51:48] because he he felt like he couldn't take
[1:51:51] on this man he felt like he was too big
[1:51:53] and so brother brandom didn't approach
[1:51:54] it at first but finally he stood up to
[1:51:58] the man and said don't touch her don't
[1:52:02] you dare touch her oh and as he did he
[1:52:04] said my muscles begin to grow like a
[1:52:07] giant and then he begin to say don't
[1:52:09] touch or you have to deal with me and he
[1:52:11] said he begin to stand and all of a
[1:52:13] sudden his faith muscles begin to rise
[1:52:15] up like a giant amen and he begin to
[1:52:18] show us that that that that was a type
[1:52:20] of the church and a type of the
[1:52:22] denomination ational husband and mean
[1:52:24] beating her with that Trinity Doctrine
[1:52:25] and things and me and mean and what
[1:52:28] would have happened if brother Brandon
[1:52:29] wouldn't have stood up to that thing man
[1:52:33] what would have happened we'd probably
[1:52:35] all be here baptizing the Trinity this
[1:52:37] morning amen but he took a stand against
[1:52:41] that Trinity Doctrine the Lord and when
[1:52:44] he did it he realized he had greater
[1:52:47] strength than he thought he
[1:52:49] did amen and I say what would happen
[1:52:53] if we didn't take a stand against these
[1:52:56] things it it may get
[1:52:59] uncomfortable but what would happen if
[1:53:02] we stopped preaching against these
[1:53:04] things what would happen if we let down
[1:53:07] the bars and then all a sudden you're
[1:53:11] too scared to approach
[1:53:13] it but what would happen if you do take
[1:53:17] a stand and then all a sudden you
[1:53:20] realize okay
[1:53:23] I'm a lot bigger than this thing I'm a
[1:53:26] lot stronger than this thing
[1:53:29] amen it's a Time friends it's a time to

[1:53:47] lord it's the power of His might so be
[1:53:50] strong it's a time to be strong
[1:53:53] it's a time to be
[1:53:54] strong amen maybe you've maybe you've
[1:53:58] come to a place in your own life you've
[1:54:00] been scared to take a stand against it
[1:54:02] because you you think it's stronger than
[1:54:04] you you've been scared you're scared to
[1:54:07] approach it you sometimes wonder if you
[1:54:10] have the Holy Ghost or not but you're
[1:54:12] scared to take a stand against it
[1:54:14] because you don't you're worried maybe
[1:54:17] and you're you're you're worried you
[1:54:19] think it's bigger than you you're scared
[1:54:21] to take a stand against that depression
[1:54:23] against that anxiety that is so good
[1:54:25] you're scared to take a stand against
[1:54:26] that that lustful spirit because you
[1:54:29] think it's bigger than you amen but just
[1:54:33] one time say
[1:54:36] Lord I want my strength

[1:55:08] of the hour now is the rapture of the
[1:55:12] church and intellectual strength will
[1:55:15] never do
[1:55:17] it amen and denominational strength will
[1:55:20] never put you in it but but God revealed
[1:55:23] himself to Abraham at 99 years old just
[1:55:27] before the change as elshad ey that he
[1:55:31] could draw strength from
[1:55:33] elhi and and though he was weak in his
