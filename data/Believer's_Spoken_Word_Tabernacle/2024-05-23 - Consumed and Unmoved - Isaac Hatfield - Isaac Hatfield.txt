God and so we just greet you and if you have your Bibles we'll just go straight to the word we're going to turn first to Hebrews 12 and we'll have two two texts and then we'll have you be seated and we'll try to not keep you tonight Hebrews 12: 25-29 and then we'll turn to Matthew 17 we're missing having my wife here tonight but the the baby had to get tubes in his ears this week and so she's just taking it a little easy today but appreciate brother Ronnie helping us drive up here amen verse 25 see that you refuse not him that speaketh for if they escape not who refused him that spake on Earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from Heaven whose voice then shook the Earth but now he ha promised saying yet once more I shake not the Earth only but also heaven and this word yet once more signify the removing of those things that are shaken as of things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken May remain wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have Grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear for our God is a consuming fire Amen in Matthew 17 just the first eight verses here talking about the mount Transfiguration experim experience it says after 6 days Jesus taketh Peter James and John his brother and bringeth them up into and high mountain apart and was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun and his rment was white as the light and behold there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him then answered Peter and said unto Jesus Lord it is good for us to be here if thou Wilt let us make here three Tabernacles one for thee one for Moses and one for Elias and while he yet spake Behold a bright Cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased hear ye him and when the disciples heard it they fell on their face and were sore afraid and Jesus came and touched them and said arise and be not afraid and when they had lifted up their eyes they saw no man save Jesus only amen if we could bow our heads for word of prayer if you have a need tonight just lift it before the Lord and he sees he sees your heart Heavenly Father Lord we call upon your name tonight father for we realize Lord that we have no ability of Our Own Lord and Lord every human ability father would would get us nowhere but Lord we yield ourselves to you tonight asking Lord that you just take a hold of this service and use it for your glory in some way Lord just to speak to the hearts of your children father Lord that we may each leave here a little closer to you than when we came father I pray that you just Minister Lord bless this assembly father and those that maybe even couldn't be here tonight I pray you be with them where they're at father and encourage them along the way Lord as we commit this service into your hands in Jesus name amen you may have your seats as we just want to take a little thought out of that on consumed and unmoved uh consumed and on moved just some things that have been on my heart just been studying some on hear ye him and on the voice of the Lord and brother Brandon preached this service many times and he shows that it was a type of the coming of the Lord and here on Mount Transfiguration was a type of the coming of the Lord and he said it showed the order of the coming there was Moses which represented the dead Saints and Elijah represented the living Saints and then there stood Jesus glorified as a type of the coming of the Lord and he even would show that in the chapter just before that that it was written that there he said I say unto you there be some standing here which shall not taste a death till they see the son of man coming in his kingdom and he he showed that it wasn't that um that they would uh live to see the the Fulfillment of the coming of the Lord and its entirety because he didn't even say that all of you standing here he said there be some standing here which we'll see see him coming in his kingdom and those some that were standing there were Peter James and John and he was about to take them up on the mount and show them the order of the coming of his kingdom and there they would see him standing there and so and so he would begin to show us that you know in the order of his coming that there will be a Moses and Elijah and of course we know that that the the two prophets will go to Israel but also we've received an Elijah in our hour before the coming of the Lord he said behold I will send unto you Elijah and we've seen Moses and the type of Israel returning to her Homeland and and and we've seen those things happen in our hour but here he said he's showing them an order of the coming of the Lord but but then he would say it's also how the Bible all ties together he said he said and I know that the correct order of this scripture is the coming of the Lord but he began to take it also as a type of adoption how God took his son up onto the mountain and Peter called it a Holy Mountain but brother Brandon say it wasn't so much that it was a Holy Mountain but there was a holy God up on the mountain and as they gathered there God was adopting his son for for for he wasn't making him his son he was already the Son of God but he was adopting his son for he hadn't just been gatting about he hadn't just been going about just living any kind of life he had been about the father's business he he had been obedient only doing what the Lord commanded him to do and so God was about to adopt him on Mount Transfiguration and he brought three Earthly Witnesses up on the mountain Peter James and John which represent faith hope and charity and he brought three Heavenly Witnesses Moses Elijah and Jesus which represent law Justice and mercy and Peter got excited at the supernatural you see there Jesus was transfigured before him his face Shone like the sun a cloud overshadowed them and Moses and Elijah appeared and Peter got all excited at the Supernatural and said well let's build three Tabernacles one for Moses one for Elijah and one for Jesus but the problem was that Moses only represented the law and the law was only a policeman that could put you in jail the the law could only condemn you the law could only lock you up and put you in jail and so Moses uh P Peter wanted to build a tabernacle for the law but the law had no Redeeming Grace and and and the law had had a period of time where the voice of the Lord spoke out on Mount Si and he gave them the Ten Commandments and said take heed onto it said the law had a place there was a time when the voice of the Lord that rang out was ringing out the voice of The Commandments but but but the law was only a shadow of good things to come and and and but here was one coming on the scene who wasn't after just the law but he was after the order of MDC here here the one standing up on that mountain was one that was a priest not made after the law but after the power of an endless life and and when he came on the earth he would speak you know that it said that you shall not kill but I say that whosoever whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause is already killed and you shall not you shall not commit adultery but I say unto you whosoever lookth upon a woman you see here was coming one on the scene and he wasn't changing the law for for God's word cannot change but he come and he magnified the law and it was Jesus it was the Fulfillment of it coming on the scene and and so Peter said well let's build a tabernacle for Elijah but you see Elijah only represented God's justice you know there was a time where Elijah went up onto the mountain and the king of Samaria wanted him to come down off the mountain so he sent an army of 50 and said go on up and get Elijah off that mountain and so they went up and Elijah said if I be a man of God let fire fall from Heaven and consumed this Army and fire fell and consumed them and so the king said well it must have just been an electric storm and so he sent another Army and fire fell and consumed them and brother B said until he got tired of sending 50s and and that was God's justice that was what God's justice would do would would consume and Destroy and brother brand would say I don't want God's justice I want God's mercy I want God's love and God's grace and so but he said thank the Lord Before Peter could ever even get through saying that brother brandom said that God nipped it in the bud before he could ever even finish what he was saying there come a voice that rung out from heaven and said this is my beloved Son and whom I am well pleased hear ye him and when they looked back the law had passed away Justice had passed away and they looked and they saw Jesus only there he was standing on that mountain and everything had passed away and all they could see was Jesus and that's where you got to come in your life and that's the problem I think many times even around the message is that people only go far enough to see the law they only go far enough to see the Justice all they see is a set of rules that I got to dress a certain way I got to live a certain way if I don't read my Bible enough I'm going to go to hell and they live in a state of bondage and legalism because they never got far enough to see Jesus only they never got far enough to see Christ in this message but if you ever get far enough to see Christ to see a living reality and realize that this is God's love to you this is God's mercy that he's reached down in this generation to pluck you up out of your miserable condition it'll bring a liberty in your life you're not just consumed with a bunch of of legalism and and until you get a holier than thou attitude that I'm better than you because I've done more with my own works or or or or or just God's justice but you've looked and you've heard the voice of the Lord in this message amen you've heard more than the voice of William brandom but you've heard the voice of Jesus and you've looked and you saw one that's able to bring you into relationship where you're no longer just serving the lord because you have to not to go to hell but you serve him because you love him amen and you realize that you're saved by his grace you're saved by his blood you're saved by his sacrifice on Calvary oh and that sacrifice is the power that it takes to save you brother Brandon would begin to show us that salvation is not Jesus plus salvation is Jesus alone you don't look and see Jesus and the law you look and you see Jesus only and that is the basis that you are saved by it's not his blood plus your conduct brother Ben it's not your blood plus what you can muster up and do you're going to make mistakes you're going to be full of failures and you're going to get back up but but but but that your salvation is not based upon your Works your salvation is B based upon the blood and the power of the blood and the blood only oh and that'll bring a settl to your life if you can ever realize that that even in the midst of your mistakes and your failures that that does not change how God sees you oh brother Brandon would tell us that I believe if you if you are saved you will do good you you you you're not just going to you're not just going to disobey the Lord if you sin willfully then then there's something wrong but but but but it but that doesn't change how how you're viewed in the eyes of God oh you got to see Jesus only hear ye him and brother Brandon preached this message 20 times on tape that I counted and so he must have been trying to get something to us he said it's a small text but he said obedience to that will bring will bring a repeat of Pentecost he said why would you hear him because he's the only one that can save he's the only one that can heal he said I'm I'm the Lord and I heal all your diseases he he said he said he was uh wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities and the chastisement of our peace was upon him and by his stripes we are healed and he's the only one that can heal you that's why we want to hear him because because it's his voice that makes the difference he's the only one who has eternal life brother brenon said he's the only one who can beat you and stand between man and God and Bridge the way and make a way for you he said no law can can do it no judgment can do it no Works can do it it's nothing but the love of Jesus and so there's power in hearing him if you could ever hear him correctly it could be a word of Salvation that would pass you from death onto life it could take a man seeking the Holy Ghost and give him the Holy Ghost it could take a cancer ridden patient and make him so cancer free it could it could take blind eyes and open them it could take deaf ears and open it's the power of the word of God not just a dead letter but the word of God as it comes forth in power and demonstration and falls in the good ground of your heart it'll bring to pass exactly what it said it would do because it's it's God's word it's the it's a word of authority this voice that we have received is a voice of authority and and brother Brenham said after all he's the voice of authority and God himself witnessed so at this time when he said said hear ye him he said there's many doctrines there's many isms he he said but hear ye him because he's the voice of final Authority he's the one that'll speak he's the one that said the heavens and earth will pass away but my word will never pass away says so he you him he's the one to listen to you see there there's a lot of voices in this world there there's the voice of politics there's the voice of Hollywood there's the voice of the church that's just trying to get more members and brother Brandon would say there's the voice of the false prophet there there's all kinds of voices that have come into this age to try to distract you but when you realize that that voice is contrary to the word then you can recognize that it's the enemy trying to distract you that when the true voice comes that you wouldn't be able to recognize it or that you wouldn't listen to it but there is a voice of authority and when that voice ever once speaks it's the authority on the subject it's the yay and amen it's the finished work because it's the voice of God and when God speaks that settles it because his word is the power of authority and the Roman the Roman Centurion recognized that he recognized that he could say that I'm not even worthy that you come into my house he said but just speak the word only and my servant will be healed you know gyrus had said that if you could lay your hands upon my daughter but this man this man as a Gent and Jesus would commend him and say I haven't found so great a faith not even in Israel but he recognized what Authority meant and he as a man of authority could command his soldiers to go and they would go and to stay and they would stay and as a man of authority he recognized what a voice of authority would do and when he seen Jesus com into the midst he recognized if he could just speak a word if he could just say one word then that would settle it forever that would change it all you don't even have to come to my house just speak a word let let one word come forth from those lips of almighty God and that'll change everything that'll be the answer that'll be the final say over the situation and then I won't have to listen to any other voice because I'll know the answer and you may not be able to stop every voice from coming into your head but you can choose which one to listen to and you don't have to listen to any voice of the devil you don't have to listen to any lying vanity come back to the voice of God come back to the word of God and let that be your absolute let that be your Shield let that be your anchor in the times of trouble when the enemy comes in like a flood oh you say I don't have to listen to any voice that would try to persuade me to give up or try to persuade me to let down the guard or try to persuade me to let down the bar and just live a halfway life or or or just to just to not be so uh hard on the devil and to let let things come into your life but if it's contrary to the word then then don't take heed to that voice but take heed to the voice that has spoken from heaven for it's the voice of authority anden when he speaks that settles it but but but we've been told take heed see that you refuse it not amen and that's what he told us in Hebrews refuse not him that that speaketh and brother BR said hear ye himym it's a challenge it's a command it's a pardon it's all that you have need of if you'll just accept it in that way but brother Brandon would teach us and he would tell us a story many times about that young man who had been guilty and he was going to be executed and Abraham Lincoln wrote him a pardon but he wrote it and it wasn't on any fancy letterhead it was just on a piece of paper and he wrote a pardon to that young man but that young man didn't receive it because it didn't come the way he thought it would come and it wasn't on a pretty letter and he so he thought it must not be real and so he refused it and he was executed and they had to come to the decision that a pardon is only a pardon when received as a pardon and so brother Brandon would teach us that if you spurn Mercy there's nothing left but judgment so see that she refused not the voice but take heed to the voice of authority uh there was a boy one time and he was he was sentenced to the I believe it was to be hung and his mother felt so bad for him that she went before the governor and she crawled on her hands and knees to the governor and pleaded for his life and so the governor said okay I'll go down and I'll talk to them so the governor went over to the jail house he went in the cell with that young boy and he said young man can I speak to you for a moment young man I've got something to tell you can I speak speak to you but that young man said no can't you see I'm nervous can't you see I'm about to die I'm nervous can't you see and so the young man wouldn't give no time to the governor and so when the governor left he asked the guard who was that man he said it was the governor you you're so silly that the governor was in your cell and as he hung on that hanging block he was thinking oh the governor was in my cell but I refused to hear his voice and so the voice of authority has the ability to Pardon you but see that you refuse not him that speaketh and hear ye the voice of the Lord anden and this this in the days of Jesus he was preaching about how I am the door and I am the Good Shepherd and there he was preaching I have power to lay down my life and I have power to pick it up again and when he spoke that that said in John that there was a division therefore again among the Jews for these thingss and many of them said he hath the devil and is mad why hear ye him and E said these are not the words of him that hath a devil can a devil Open the Eyes of the blind oh there was a voice of authority on the scene and he was speaking forth a message I have power to lay down my life I have power to lift it up again I am the door I am the shepherd to the Sheepfold no man comes to the father but by me and they said he's a he's a man he's beab he's a man full of devils and there was a division among them oh my and we've had a voice of authority in this age he's come a mighty Angel has descended clothed with the cloud and brother brandom identifi that as the Supreme judge the supreme authority no other voice no other one like this and he come forth and yet still the question remains why hear ye him the devil still goes about like a roaring lion saying oh he was just a man oh he was just a Kentucky hillbilly oh it was just his opinion why hear you him why you hear him is because he's the voice of authority oh but there is a people that have heard the voice and they've taken heed to it and it hasn't sounded back in condemnation but it sounded back in pardon that you are the sinless Spotless bride you never did it in the first place you are free you are not guilty but I've called you out of denominations I called you to be my people oh and you heard the voice of par oh there was a division among them oh but you got to know what side of the Divide you're on oh I am not on the side of the divide with the critics that say he's full of devils but I am on the side of those that were beyond the curtain of time saying we are resting on it we are resting that you taught what Paul taught we are resting that this is a voice of authority and it's good enough to take care of my children and it's good enough to take care of my family and it's good enough to take care of my oh it's good enough to put me in a Rapture and that sounded back pardon on your life you are free you are no longer guilty come out of the jail cell you're free to worship you're free to live a holy overcoming life you're free to believe this message oh we are not on the side of the divid is the critic we are on the side of the believer and the voice that comes back over your life will not be a voice of judgment it'll be a voice of pardon oh it's a beautiful saying when the voice of authority becomes a voice of pardon he's the judge he has the power to to condemn and send you to hell but you received his word and it sounded back pardon you're free ah you never did it in the first place oh you don't have to carry that condemnation any longer there's no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus oh who walked not after the flesh but after the spirit and it was a voice of pardon it's a voice of authority and there's power in accepting that voice it's that voice that that's persuading you it's that voice that's that that's keeping you why we're still here why we're still pressing there's a voice persuading us you see in the Bible when when in the First Kings there's a story of of Ahab and Jehoshaphat and Micaiah and Jehoshaphat had joined ranks with Ahab and brother Brandon would say that's where he made his mistake he should have never joined up with Ahab but they joined together and they said a Ahab said well will you go down with me to ramoth Gilead and and you intellectually that was a good idea maybe because it did belong to them when Joshua had divided the land ramoth Gilead did belong to Israel and so they were going to go up and possess it but the thing was was that Ahab was was not living the way he should have and and if he would have just went back to the word and lived the right kind of life then maybe things would have been different but but he wasn't he wasn't living right and and there was a prophecy over his life that that Elijah had already prophesied that the dogs would lick his blood and so here he is saying will you go up with me to ramoth Gilead and there is Jehoshaphat and he said well let's consult the Lord about this and let's see what the Lord has to say and so there came 400 prophets and and and there they were saying go up and take it go up and take the land you know God is with you and and there zedekiah even came with two horns and he said by these and even even gave thus sayith the Lord by these we'll push back the Army by these we'll take the land but there was a Micaiah in the land and the thing about Micaiah was he he had already heard the prophecy of Elijah and so Mah as a as a true prophet of God could only stay with the word and so when they consulted Micaiah he he he said he said uh I see Israel uh Fallen you know I see them scattered like sheep and so there was Micaiah and he said you know that Ahab would be like I I told you you know he's always prophesying evil against me I I told you I didn't like this man he he never has anything good to say but but how could he when Elijah had already prophesied evil over Ahab and so we find that you just can't bless what God has cursed and so Micaiah could never bless Ahab when God had already cursed Ahab and brother Brandon when he was here he told us that America had rejected the the the the message and that they they would never have Revival and they were going into destruction and the young man got up behind him and said you know well brother Brandon may have said it was over for the Pentecost and things like that he said but it's not over for me and brother would say he just didn't know which end of the horn he was blowing out of because how could you bless what God had cursed and it's just the same for the positive that how can you curse what God has blessed and and balam found that out one time when he tried to curse Israel uh because BAC wanted them to come and curse Israel and then trying to curse them all he could do was bless them and all that ever came forth was blessings because you just can't curse what God has blessed amen so you got to find what side of the prophecy you're on you got to find where you're at in scripture and realize that no matter how many voices ever try to curse you if the voice of authority has ever once blessed you then you're blessed brother then you're then you're blessed sister if the voice of this word has called you blessed then no matter how many voices there's not enough voices in this world that could ever curse you and me because God has called you blessed and that's the voice that we're worried about and so Mah came up and prophesied and Ahab went up and he ended up dying up there in battle because that was what had been prophesied over his life but Micaiah said I I seen a vision of a lying Spirit coming up before the Throne of God and God would say that who shall we get to go down and persuade Ahab to go up to ramoth Gilead that he might fulfill what was spoken and so a lying Spirit came up from hell and persuaded those 400 prophets to prophesy a lie that he might go up oh are you hearing me and fulfill what what Elijah had prophesied you see Micaiah could only say what Elijah had said amen and Peter on the day of Pentecost when he got up he said this is that which was spoken of by the prophet Joel and he was quoting what the prophet had already said amen and so and so we stay with the prophet am mean we stay with the word and when he had done that the lying Spirit went up and persuaded Ahab to fulfill what was spoken over his life and so and so and so there's a spirit sent into this earth right anden but if a lying Spirit could persuade Ahab to fulfill prophecy then what about a bride amen that's been prophesied over that there would be a bride without spot or wrinkle that there would be a bride that wouldn't fall like e fell there would be a bride that was going to make it there would be a people that would go in a Rapture and me and you've not been persuaded by a lying Spirit but God sent a spirit of Truth into this age that's persuaded your life to come out from denominations come out from among every other voice and follow me amen and it's a voice that's persuading you amen when every other voice is telling you to quit amen every other voice is telling you just to give up and just just to stop where you're at amen but there's prophecy over your life it's becoming of you to stand it's becoming of you to fulfill all righteousness amen and you must fulfill what's been spoken over your life amen so God has sent a voice Amen to call you out and to lead you and to guide you and to persuade you keep pressing hold fast don't give up persevere now is not the time to lay down the sword now is not the time to give up amen do you hear the voice coming forth out of this message to keep pressing amen when brother Brandon went beyond the curtain of time there was a voice when we said do I have to go back and he said yeah but keep pressing keep pressing am mean there's a Heavenly voice that's persuaded you oh not to give up am mean it's what's persuaded you amen it's that voice that persuaded Rebecca am me it was the voice of elazer that she heard and it persuaded her to leave houses and lands to leave father and mother and we've you've had a voice come in this age it was the voice of elzer and it's persuaded you it's persuaded you to follow him oh and you say Lord to whom would I go I mean I I'm persuaded that you alone hold the words of eternal life where else could I go besides you Lord and it's tugging at you and it's persuading you amen you see Paul was a man persuaded he said I'm persuaded that he which has spoke it is able to perform it and the one that speaks is able to perform what he's spoken and mean you can sit there and worry about it all day long about how you're going to perform it and how you're going to manifest it but God's never called you to perform it God's just called you to believe it God's just called you to hold on to the promise because the voice that spoke it is the voice that will perform it oh he's a God that speaks and he's able to take care of his word and when it will not return void oh and he's the one that spoke this Rapture he'll be the one that will perform it amen and and he's not called you to man to manifest the word uh through your own ability but he's just called you to to to to not to to but just to manifest it as a vessel as a surrendered vessel and mean you don't have to manufacture it you don't have to you don't have to to work it up oh you're just like a sheep that bears wool and it just comes forth and manifest out of your life because that's who you are because you are a son and daughter of God you will manifest the word of God oh Paul would say I am persuaded that he's able to keep that which I've committed unto him against the day amen he's able to keep it that which I've committed unto him amen are you persuaded are you persuaded that that that that this voice is is a is a voice of authority amen then you have a then you can then you can commit something into his hands and let go and let God take care of Amen brother brandom told us that one of the the most powerful weapons in the hands of the church is a committal amen that you can commit something into the hands of God and he will perform it and me he will take care of it and and you sit and you lay awake at night worried about about your job and about your children and worried about your future and worried about this and that and you worry yourself to death thinking about all these things but just commit it into the hands of God Amen he spoke it and he'll perform it amen he'll take care of it oh you've held it in your hands long enough haven't you held it long enough uh maybe a mother here that you've held it so long till it weighs on you but but I am persuaded that this voice that has spoken he's able to keep that which he's that which you commit into his hands oh it's the voice of God and and we're persuaded and and that's why we persevere uh because it's this voice pulsating into our hearts and sometimes you get weary and sometimes you feel like throwing in the towel and and then you come to church on Sunday morning and brother Samuel's preaching away and all a sudden it becomes more than the voice of brother Samuel but God picks up that voice and begins to speak don't give up don't give in you're a Son of God keep pressing and all of a sudden that voice begins to persuade you to keep going oh it's not a lying spirit that we're persuaded by it's the spirit of God that's persuading our lives back to the voice we're not here to to to lift up ourselves we're here to lift up lift up the voice of God uh the Bible said if I be lifted up I will draw all men unto me and brother brandham said hear ye him he's the one that can save you he's the one that can heal you he's the one that's responsible for this he's the one respons responsible to his word he said preach it from the pulpit whatever wherever you are lift him up give him to the people hear ye him amen Amen brother Samuel we have no ability as humans to to fix problems and and to answer questions but we're here to exalt The Voice hearing him and if he be lifted up he can take care of every situation he can take care of every problem amen just hear ye him don't uh you got some come sometimes come to the place where you stop exalting the problem and you start exalting the solution you start exalting the voice and mean I don't understand it Lord but I'm listening I don't understand it Lord but I'm trying I'm trying to pay attention to your voice Lord what do you have to say about it Lord what do you think about it anden we're not here to lift ourselves up we're here to lift up the voice of the Lord because brother brandom taught us that a true Mount Transfiguration experience didn't glorify Moses it didn't glorify Elijah it only glorified Jesus Christ and a true Mount Transfiguration experience will only glorify Jesus Christ and a true adopted son or daughter is not here on the earth to build a kingdom for themselves oh you're not here on the earth to build up something for yourself look at me look at what I can do look at what I've done for the Lord but we're here to point to him and lift up Jesus Christ and say look at him hear his voice he's the one he's the one coming in power it's his kingdom that we're interested in oh hear ye him hear the word of the Lord and lift him up amen we're not here to establish ourselves we're here to establish the word of God in the hearts of the people amen that they might come into into a solid Church uh so that a young person that's so unstable could come to a place of rest to come to a place of solidness and never come through our ability it'll come through the word of the Lord amen we're about the father's business and that's to vindicate the word we've got one objective win souls we've got one mode of love one objective mind the father keep the word I mean that's our desire and if that's not your desire I mean you got to look at yourself say Lord what kingdom am I working for what what kingdom am I labor in for amen if I were just to get up here just to try to say look at me amen and try to build a kingdom for myself amen it in a blink of an eye it would crumble down again but if we labor for the kingdom of God I mean it's an eternal Kingdom that's why we're here to labor not just to not just to build numbers I mean if God does it that's great but but but the main thing is we want to get the people to Jesus we want to get them to an experience and we want to get them to a reality we want to get them to the kingdom of God we want to get them to a place where where if we never see him again on this Earth we know that we'll meet them in eternity and that's the kingdom that we're working for we're not working for the kingdoms of of our own selves but we're laboring for the kingdom of God Amen brother Brandon preached this message hear you him and one time he preached it in an arena and he he was talking about calling a prayer line and he said well we can't call a prayer line maybe because of of of the situation this is an arena and he said Brothers we'll be fighting Brothers tomorrow night but tonight is the house of God and that's the thing that a prophet could come on the earth and he could turn an arena into the church anden but what we never want us do is turn the church into Arena and turn it into a bunch of fighting and a bunch of bickering and a bunch of arguing but we're here to lift up the voice of the Lord we're here to lift up him he you him he's the Alpha and Omega he's the problem Sol is's a yay and amen oh lift up him and let him come down oh and take care of the problem oh it it's a word of Pardon amen it's a reality oh hear ye himen but we are but we are in a fight amen it's just that you got to learn how to fight amen some Sometimes some of us might be built a little bit a little bit quick to the gun and that's okay but you just got to yield that to the Lord amen and instead of using that on your brother and and you use it on the devil for Paul said we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places amen and Peter when he was on the earth there there he was and he was ready to cut off the ear of that Soldier amen but then he went up to the upper room and God sent down a power on his life and he he became became the spokesman for the day of Pentecost and brother Bram said we got to fight he said but pick up tonight and receive the Holy Ghost and defeat every devil of sin drunkenness whatever it is we've got him on the run to be conquered and he would tell us about Arnold Von Winkler how how how Arnold Von Winkler gave sticks and stones and and gave him to his army to follow him and fight but brother said we don't got sticks and stones but we got the word and the spirit anden and we're commanded to fight against this devil amen friends we we've got to fight we we've got young people that that need the Lord we've got people that that are in real battles and so and so we've got to fight we've got something worth fighting for anden we've got a kingdom worth laboring for that it's worth getting down on your knees and and saying Lord I need you right now Lord I'm in a real situation Lord and you've given me your word and you've given me your spirit so Lord I I've come to fight for fight for my promises I've come to fight Lord that you would that you would come in on the my behalf Lord and Rescue Me Oh in this dark trial uh you see it's becoming of you to fulfill all righteousness it's becoming of you to keep pressing you know when brother Brandon preached that message it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness there he was preaching that while his mother Lay Dying in the hospital and there he was and he would preach away and said but it's becoming of me now to stay with this word it's becoming of me now and he would come to that end of the service and say that the devil's been trying to get me out of this Pulpit all this time but it's becoming a me and he would begin to stand there as a Son of God in his position and say it's becoming of me now to stand for this word and amen it's becoming of you as Sons and Daughters of God to stay in your position oh the devil will try to persuade you out of your position try to persuade you not to come to church try to persuade you that that you're never going to make it or that this Holy Ghost isn't for you or that Joy isn't for you or that peace isn't for you oh that you're never going to rise to the level of a real son or daughter you'll never be able to be the type of Christian that your pastor is oh but take heed to the voice of the Lord that's persuading You Stand Fast oh don't leave your position oh and brother Brandon preached that message and he came back and preached the comforter that evening and he would say m Mama doesn't know it but he kept her alive amen Jesus was there taking care of Mama while brother brandom stood in his position amen and if you stay in your position as a as a son or daughter of God he's able to take care of every situation he's able to take care of your family he's able to take care of your loved ones he's able to take care of it oh he's able to take care just just commited onto him and stay in your position oh he'll take care of iten but we've had them we've had something that's come in this age and and there they were on that mount Transfiguration and what was Mount Transfiguration doing it it ended the struggle because God was establishing a kingdom and it would no more be just the words of the law and the prophets but here the fullness of the word was coming in their midst and and he was man esting and vdic vindicating the words uh that have been spoken by the prophets before him he was the manifestation of the prophet's words and here the prophet would would cry out thus sayith the Lord but now he would come on the earth and say I say unto you here he he was had come from partial realization brother BR say to perfect realization he in the in in the days of the Israelites they had Mana from heaven but Jesus was the the true bread from Heaven they had partial salvation under the blood of bulls and goats but here was the one that was would bring the fullness that he could enter in once and shed a blood for our sins and it would say Israel had light but now True Light had come now the Fulfillment of light has come and said Moses was a prophet but Jesus was the prophet amen David was king of Israel but Jesus was the greater David he he was theing king of kings and Peter wrote about this in second Peter 1 and said whever I will endeavor that you may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance for we have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but we're eyewitnesses of this Majesty for he received from God the Father honor and Glory when there came such a voice to him from the excellent Glory this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased and this voice which came from heaven we heard when we were with him in the Holy Mount and said we also have a more sure word of Prophecy where unto you do well that you take heed amen see that you refuse it not as onto a light that shineth in a dark place until the day Dawn and the day star arise in your hearts oh he said knowing that no Prophecy of the scriptures of any private interpretation you see up to that point there may have been people going about saying this is how the Messiah will come this is how it's going to be here's my interpretation of it I think this is how it's going to be but now they would no longer have to be held under the confusion of private interpretations because God interprets his word by bringing it to pass and here was the true interpretation of the word the Messiah had come God had answered their cry and they could not they could walk in the light of that Vindicated word and they would no longer have to be under confusion because the Messiah had come and that Vindicated word could consume their minds consume their lives amen amen something's going to consume Our Lives amen uh I think sometimes not all of it's bad but sometimes maybe uh uh Hobbies consume our lives and and certain things consume our lives but something's going to consume your life amen h as a human being and and there's going to be something that that has preeminence in your life but but I'm so thankful that that that Paul told us that our God is a consuming fire amen and fire is the most consuming thing that there is and and so brother brandom said we just need the fire he said let the fires go out in your church brother and the church is gone he said he would tell a story about this I believe it a Baptist preacher who had got saved and they were trying to tell him that uh you can't preach like that anymore he said if you don't quit preaching like that you're going to kill your church and brother B said he said look at here Elder he said any church that ever dies with Holy Ghost fire in it he said I'll climb them old Vines out there to the top of this Pinnacle lay my hands on it and say bless it is the law the dead defying the law he said they don't die they just get alive they die to the things of the world in order to come alive in Christ Jesus amen and fire has been God's program amen throughout the Bible in the Book of Genesis brother Paul that if they wanted to come into the garden and get to that tree of life they had to come by those cherubims right and those cherubims would hold that fiery sword and guard that tree of life and they would keep them out from that garden and now those chims are are not keeping us from that tree of life now they're ushering Us in amen but but they still have that element of fire because brother B would tell us that he said notice Holy Spirit fire guarding the gate he said and today that's what guards the gate he said if you're scared of Holy Ghost and Fire you'll never get in fiery the sword of God God is a consuming fire watching that tree guarding that tree of life anden and God Appears in fire god appeared in fire in the burning bush with Moses that right brother Aaron and go God God appeared in fire amen before Daniel and and the Dan of lions and those Lions wouldn't even touch him and that in the presence of that Pillar of Fire like that old song brother Brandon was saying it's the oldtime Holy Spirit and the devil Don't Go Near it that's the reason people fear it but it's good enough for me it's the fire of God and God Appears in it and he appeared in it on the road to Damascus amen he appears in Fire H but but it's a consuming fire and mean and the first time fire was mentioned in the Bible was when Sodom and Gomorrah uh uh it began to telling how they were judged as fire and brimstone fell upon him in judgment anden and Jude picked that up in in the book of Jude and and says even as Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities about them in like manner giving themselves over to fornication and going after strange flesh are set forth an example suffering the Vengeance of Eternal fire it's fire that completely consumes and and does away with anden and and but but when brother Brandon picked up that that verse on Eternal fire he said that is to be completely consumed and done away with man as we begin to draw it to a close here he is making this point that there is a a consuming fire but they would ask him about you know brother they would ask brother brandom about a question on eternal hell and I love his answer he said will it just be like regular Brimstone he said I believe it'll be a million times worse than that I I believe you couldn't describe it by fire by literal fire he said the only reason it's put by fire is that fire is the most consuming thing that we have it absolutely consumes and destroys everything fire does he said well then it'll be in there but you'll have a soul that'll have to be punished through some kind and then he stops and he says now we have to watch the word fire because the Holy Ghost is used the Holy Ghost and Fire cuz Holy Ghost Fire Burns sin out see and makes clean amen so you see friends there's going to come a time in your life where you'll have to come in contact with fire and you'll either be saved by fire or you'll be destroyed by fire but there is God's got of fire and mean and just as he'll use that Holy Fire to cleanse this Earth that a bride May dwell on it amen in in in the in the world that is to come so there is a fire that he sends down to clean out your heart and clean out your life that he may dwell in it and and God God still got a fire to consume sacrifices I still believe that you can lay yourself before the Lord as a sacrifice and he's still got a fire that he'll send down and he'll consume you as a pig and rebirth you as a lamb and rebirth you as a Son of God and that Fire released in the church amen will do more than any any program will ever do than any soup supper would ever do than than any psychology will ever do it's the fire of God God that will birth you into a Son of God it's not the it's not uh it's not some wild fire it's it's God's fire God's had a fire through all generations it's the same fire that Paul met it's the same fire that Moses met it's that same fire that's still in our lives today that comes and burns out sin and consumes you as a Living Sacrifice oh and it's a fire that'll keep you it's a keeping power in the heart of the believer and me brother bam say you can't burn it out and mean they tried to burn it out in the Hebrew children and me and they there was brother said how could fire burn fire and there was a fire in those children that couldn't be burned out no matter what trials they went through no matter but the bible say that they didn't even smell like fire amen and sometimes you go through a trial and as a real believer if you didn't tell somebody about it they would never know it because you don't smell like fire you don't look burn at all but there's a fire in you that has kept you through many trials and many tribulations he brother said you can't boil it out they couldn't boil it out of John uh in that vat of oil because he said how could you boil fire with fire there was a fire in John that no devil could boil out no enemy could take that from him it had been lit by God and it kept him through all of his days and me you can't blow it out and there's not enough cold spells to blow it out there's not enough indifference Sister Kim to blow it out there's not enough fighting and bickering to blow it out and mean it'll keep you in the midst of every trial and tribulation and mean there's not enough Winds of Doctrine to blow out the fire of God in his church amen amen because brother BR told us that when a man walks in the light the wind follows and me and when the children of Israel walked in the light brother there was a wind that came behind him and split that Red Sea wide open that they could walk through it and when men of God Walk In The Light there's a wind that follows and when we walk in the light of this Vindicated word there is a wind of the Holy Ghost that follows amen and that wind is greater than any wind of doctrine that wind is greater than any wind of adversity or any wind of Opp opposition it it's the fire of God that's consumed our lives and brother once you once been saved by fire you can't be destroyed by fire and me the fire of hell has no power over your life and me atomic fire can't hurt you once you've ever once been consumed by the fire of God anden judgment has no power over your life why is that because uh he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me shall not come into judgment shall not come into condemnation but has already passed from Death onto life when you heard this word it released a pardon over your life amen in judgment fire cannot ever affect you which have been consumed with the fire of God it's the same fire that's been through all the ages it's the same fire that was lit on that sacred altar brother Brandon would tell us about that he's like there here's this this lamp post it's not so much a candle because a candle fire doesn't last but he would begin to describe to us that God had had a lamp with with with seven seven different uh torches for The Seven Ages and God lit that fire uh the priest took that fire from the sacred altar which God had lit and they lit that first candle and brother Brandon said it was like the outpouring on the day of Pentecost and then they would take that first candle and light that second candle and the third and fourth and fifth and sixth and seventh and and God had seven Messengers assigned to keep that flame burning through those Seven Ages uh but you know when one age would come and that messenger would go off the scene they would denominate and that fire would go out and brother Brenham said they would have to pass the torch light to the next one and and they said the methodists you know they were doing good but they denominated and the fire went out and and the torch light went on but but friends now we're in the final age and there's not another age coming and so if we if if if we ever let the fire go out there's not another age coming to pick it up amen but I'm so thankful that God has predestinated a bride that that would not denominate that that that would not add or take away one word amen but but but but if if through all those ages denomination was what put that fire out and then God's got a prde on the earth and he's got a message on the earth that can't be denominated uh you know brother brenon would say that usually after about three years the message that would come would go off into organization he said but this one's been going for nearly 20 years he said and it's still going because this is the wheat now this is this can't be denominated and that was nearly 60 years ago so the same fire am mean that brother brandom enjoyed is the same fire that we're enjoying and it's never going to go out it's never going to diminish anytime that fire would would start to maybe get low that priest would just come by and pour more more oil in amen and God me and as brother Brandon would say that there there would be a wise virgin that would have oil in her lamp and and she would have the fire on that oil she would be able to reflect the word and you would be able to enjoy a Revival that would never end me because it's fed by the word of God and and and it makes you a a lasting people it makes you if this is a kingdom that cannot be moved brother Shane and and that kingdom is in you then that makes you unmovable amen you feel like I mean uh any day now I'm just going to I'm just going to crumble any day now I'm just going to come to my end and and maybe just any day now I I'll just my my Folly will be made known and and I'm just going to crumble but but that's not how this Kingdom Works friends when this kingdom is in you it's a kingdom that cannot be moved am me and before there ever was a world to fall apart before there ever was a denomination to fall apart you were in God you were in that unmovable one and so when he expressed you forth as an attribute in this age and then he birthed you into this Kingdom it's a kingdom which cannot be moved you can't not be shaken anden there may be a lot of voices trying to persuade you to to give up uh trying to persuade you that that that is it is this all really true uh can I trust it can I really trust it for my family can I can I really trust it oh but there's a jean seed in there that speaks back I've already taken heed to the voice I've already heard I'm satisfied I am persuaded that there is no other voice oh that I need to listen to but this voice amen there's a there's a lot I I I I know how how how the devil works sometimes I I mean I don't know if I've got him all the way figured out but but I know that he he likes to talk a lot and he'll get in your mind and he'll he'll try to talk and talk and talk but but but he has no place amen and you you have a right as a son or daughter of God to refuse that voice and say no I I've already heard the voice of the word and this voice says I've already made it this voice says that it's for me this voice says that that I I can't miss it I came from God and I'm going back to God this voice speaks better things over your life than what the devil will tell you take heed to the voice of the Lord hear ye him there's power in that voice there's power that it can lead you to an overcoming life it can lead you to victory you can live a stable life in the midst of instability in the midst of a world falling apart amen amen how many witnesses are here in the building that that this word brings stability to your life how many you you can see that that there is something about this I mean there's nothing stable about me there's nothing stable about about my mind about sometimes even my spirit it's up and down but there's something about this word that I've anchored into it's a stability it's a solidness it's an absolute amen amen and and and as the musicians come there's there's when you could look you could look at a picture on the wall of of a of a of a fire and you could look at that picture and you could say mama what's that fire all about what is that and it it's it's not a painting even of a fire it's not even someone's imagination it's it's a picture of a fire that actually happened and they say well you know few years ago we had this great big fire and it was it was so wonderful you say my that's nice I I'd like to enjoy that and and and you you go through that stage sometimes as a Christian where where you hear the pastor talking about it and and you hear about it but but but you say my I'd like to have that for myself and and so maybe you walk outside and just a just an illust just something that maybe the way my mind works and and you see a great big bonfire and you say my that looks kind of like that picture I'd like to I'd like to be a part of that and you walk out and my you get warm from that you get warm from that fire you say my this is just like that that this is this and it's a real fire fire and it keeps you warm but then the minute you walk away all of a sudden that warmth leaves you and you think my how could that be that fire is is so real and it's so warm but but but brother Brandon would take that and show it like like coming to a meeting you know and you come to a meeting and it's it's the fire of God is being poured out and it's it's real fire and it's it's real fire that's being poured out and touching lives and and and but sometimes I I I if you're if it's just uh you know maybe you're not all the way uh where you should be with the Lord then when you leave he would talk about how sometimes those those Campground cramps set in and and you think my I I wish I could just keep the victory I I wish I could feel that way all the time and it wasn't that it was fanaticism no it was real fire and you were really feeling that effect but but it you see how brother brand would take how the Pentecostals could have that baptism on the spirit and and and have it on their every day of their lives and go to hell and you think my how could that be but just like standing before a bonfire you could stand before that bonfire every day of your life and and feel warmth but the minute you walk away you'll get cold again but but but you're a you're you're a you're a three compartment individual right and brother Brandon would teach us that every every house really has three rooms you know you have your kitchen you have your living area and then you have your bedroom and so there's I talked to a buddy one time and he said that a house fire can be fully consumed within five minutes I thought my Moses spent five minutes in front of that burning bush and it did more for him than than anything in the world could ever do than 40 years in Egypt could ever do and it brought his stability to his life and then it said how most house fires start in the kitchen I thought my there's that there's that outer realm and and you feel that fire and but as that fire begins to Creep from that kitchen it begins to creep into that living room but if that fire ever once gets in that bedroom oh then brother it's a fully consumed fire it's a fully consumed house and and this fire that I'm talking about it's the fire of God anden and if that fire gets on your flesh it'll make you dress right it'll make you car of yourself right that fire gets in your spirit it'll make you act right it'll give you a good spirit it'll give you brotherly kindness it it'll give you Joy but that fire every once gets into that soul and brother you are you are sealed for eternity you you won't be shaken you won't be moved you'll believe this word all the days of your life because it's the fire of God Amen and and as we stand our feet amen amen that's my desire I know it's a little chopped up tonight but but maybe if I don't know if we know that song consume me Lord with the fire of your spirit and me that's my prayer and man no matter how far you get even if you have been sealed sometimes you just get a little you feel like you get a little cold sometimes you've had that fire for years and years and you feel yourself just getting a little bit distant from the Lord amen but when it come to that lampstand that high priest would come by and just take some oil and pour it in and I believe we have a high priest tonight oh and I believe he still has some oil he can come by he can give you a refilling amen he can restore your joy he can give you a stability amen let's sing it together me Lord with the fire of your spirit cons me Lord and make me more like you bre me Al and Bless The Broken Pieces Of My Life Let Me [Music] Be by oh consume me Lord with the fire of your spirit cons me Lord and make me more like here Break Me Lord and Bless The Broken Pieces Of My Life Lord let me be ear Lord by and don't cons me Lord with the fire of your

this this message is really is what it's all about it's a word of authority it's a word of Pardon it's a word of Grace you know it's all all it's all about how we receive it Hallelujah a lot of voices I I love how that brother Isaac brought that out that to recognize that as a Son of [Music] God you do not become a son and daughter of God and we've heard this for years right you don't become that on a certain day that's why the real reality you always have a charge over the enemy me amen it would not matter of the greatest thing that a person could even be bound with or going through you know there wasn't enough demons to keep a man that we don't even know his name but he was called Legion yes right brother BR said he made a decision that he wasn't going to let them Devils keep him from Jesus you see what it showed was as a Son of God has Authority even to make a decision that's how it is in every situation amen and it brings it back to where that all of them like brother Isaac was saying all of those no matter what voices are going through your mind let me tell you something God will never and has never told anybody you can't find me one scripture where God ever told somebody you're not a son he's not even the one who discouraged the 10 spies he never said nothing he never said he didn't love him they didn't believe his love for them yeah they didn't trust him but God never said that you said what are you saying brother Samuel is the voice that says speaks to you and it's a condemning voice that's not God's voice the voice of God will never condemn you he'll convict but conviction always shows you Calvary and Calvary always reveals who you are and Calvary always reveals the way out of whatever it is Calvary is the way out that we can follow him that's right through the blood no matter what the situation no matter what the need trial test habit Whatever It Is God has made a way and we just follow those bloody foot Footprints and this this word when God speaks a word like this you know God brings it he could have he could have let brother Isaac call out your situation or my situation or what's on my heart God could have done that but you see the spirit of Truth we're not in an age or a moment where the spirit of Truth is being introduced to the church he's here he's here and when he says when he said when he speaks he'll bring to our remembrance God speaks right over our life and we can go right down into it and it's as though we are here one onone and it's right here on the back wall now if God needs to call it out he can call it out but you see that Church of the Living God is no longer in an introductory stage to the spirit of Truth the spirit of Truth has come and Jesus Christ has been properly identified Among Us is that right God can use any gift that's true God will use he gets them out and use them as he needs them but the spirit of truth comes and to make known in our life and he'll speak to our hearts and all we have to do is yield amen and that word let me tell you I don't care what the enemy says I don't don't care what thought comes in your mind you take what God has spoken let every other word be a lie but let God's word be true amen God says God's word has never been defeated they'll never find a record where God's word Was Defeated When anybody let down on it that's when defeat come but never is there defeat in the word of God amen amen so let's hold to that amen when the word of God directed Samson go pick up that Jawbone the spirit of the Lord anointed him and directed him to pick that up and you know what that was the word of the Lord same thing with I with shamgar with the ox go the word of the Lord when God directs You by his word you take a hold of that word and stand there on your god-given ground and don't back down for one thing that word will see you through amen amen yeah brother Bram talked about that eagle being out there and all them chatter coming around of those Chipmunks he said I looked over at that eagle he wasn't a bit nervous brother BR said it like this in 64 questions and answers he said it's the same way it is he said as the eagle trusted those wings he said that's the same way this word will pack us away it'll Lift Us in situations it'll Lift Us in circumstances and it's lifting us and it's going to lift us into Glory Hallelujah this word has Authority has power in it and I believe we as a standing as the Church of the Living God we're sufficiently impressed amen with the word that's in our midst amen you Lov him tonight amen amen wasn't that wonderful amen what a wonderful word amen amen so appreciate that brother Isaac amen amen he uh let me know earlier in the day because I had told him I told him on Sunday night I said look whether you preach this Thursday I knew the I knew little Spencer had to get tubes in those ears on Wednesday I said look if you don't preach this Thursday you can preach next Thursday one or the other but it would help me out a whole lot this Thursday but uh you know one way or another I I just felt on my heart to have him here and have him ministered to us and I so appreciate amen what amen the word that God spoke to us tonight amen what an encouraging word amen let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer Amen brother Ronnie why don't you come and dismiss us in a word of prayer so glad
