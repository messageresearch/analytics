thank you [Music] so much more foreign [Music] we don't take that for granted [Music] it's just a real it's a real privilege to be able to gather together brothers and sisters of like Precious faith there's times that truly is just like a midweek service or other times that may not feel like it as times our flesh gets weak this is where we we have to press through obviously I know that there are times where there's different ones Among Us that they'd be here if they could be here and I don't mean they're not trying to single anybody out you understand what I'm saying it's just so that we we look at it in a manner that you know it's a real privilege to come together it's just something special about it you know I I'll be honest you know when we look at how special it is God never meant for any of us to be on an island to ourselves you know it's true it's an individual walk with God that's absolutely the truth it's a person identification we can go through the quotes and scriptures but God has said it that we are a body and we need one another and it's something special where the spirit of God just begins to move right here Among Us I'll tell you this right here I need the body of Jesus Christ I need my brothers and sisters I need one another I don't it's not necessarily that well I need to I need to hear somebody say this or something I need my brothers and my sisters if there's ever a time in an hour that we're living in we recognize that it's more precious to us right now than any other time amen this is a time where we're we're getting together we're getting ready to go home it's very precious the love of God in our hearts amen for one another to recognize the Living God right here Among Us what God is doing and it's just something very very precious that the Lord would allow us to be able to come together as a body be able to pray for the needs of one another you know of everything that we want to do and say and I I don't I'm not trying to take a time of just just giving words as it would come to me but let us not be so occupied with our own selves that we fail to look on the needs of others because that's the character of Christ that's the mind of Christ as Paul said in Philippians 2 look ye every man on one another needs this is an age it's it's things that's all around us not just the spirit of the age but even the pressures of the age sometimes and so move around us to where we're looking at our own needs we're praying just exclusively about our own needs but I can tell you this right now as a witness and I know there's others here tonight as well that when you begin to move Beyond just your own needs and just begin to pray and say you know I'm going to set that aside God already knows that I've asked about that but there's some needs right here there's other burdens that strike in my heart and you begin to pray for that you'll find a release for what you have need of in your life God has so said it that we're a body of believers that's why that even as we come to the house of God you know it's it's wonderful to come here and to set with one another maybe this is just a little bit don't mean to be touchy but just as it comes to me that God never intended for us just to come and set here but it's also to greet one another and I know some things you know come up but you know not just to rush right out after a service not just to run away but it's just to even shake hands or to greet somebody you know and say God bless you in the name of the Lord God bless you brother so and so God bless you Sister it's so good to see you it's just it's very it's very very important amen we're a body of believers you know you don't realize what sometimes well I think you do what that means when someone could just express that to you and they've gone out of their way to say God bless you amen we we are a body of believers man it's wonderful to be a part of the body of Jesus Christ I want to just say my just such a wonderful day we had on Sunday just a wonderful service and uh you know brother Carmen as I spoke to him we had to go quickly to the airport as soon as he got to the airport ran into things once again they were go here go there and there was all sorts of things that we just began to pray I said God you used your servant in a mighty way today Lord make a way for him Lord make a way for me he had to go on to Denver and we just are thankful God made a way for him one thing that brother Carmen he just continued also to say he was rejoicing you know and to see what God had done as well but you know he just kept on saying he said I felt no no drawback while the word was being delivered and I'll tell you what that's that's tremendous that's that's God at work within our lives and that's what we want to be we've not come here to be seen when we come to the house of God we've not come here to be seen we don't want to know how good we are we want to know where is our shortcomings the brand said that's what the preaching of the word is is to catch from where we are to where we ought to be because the word works the word moves the word performs sometimes those channels we've got to look into those channels and say God what's moving here in these channels where is this at and I'm glad that God is mindful of every single need may we always May our hearts always be in that place when we come to the house of God lord I want to hear I want to know what it is that you've got to say to me Lord because I want to be a better Christian when I walk out of there I don't want to be filled with with knowledge I don't want to be filled with with intellect I don't want to be filled with no I want to be filled and full of the Holy Ghost I want every channel to be open if there's something in the way then we want to pull down that stronghold we're trusting that the spirit of God will move right down into our lives and move in such a way that's with every service God searched Me Lord let the word just search me out let it just let it move through my life and when things come that way within a service you know sometimes the enemy after you you know you get out and Monday comes along sometimes it's not even until Monday but remember what brother Branham said he said just as much as Elijah got done and out from under that anointing and when the mind of Christ pulled back from him he ran he said this Satan will come and try to knock the confidence that God has instilled in you on a Monday morning see God's instilled that confidence in you and this is where you stand and you continue to pray and look to God and you make your confession and you stand on it whether in your seat or up here wherever it's at you stand upon that word don't back down from it one bit but you keep praying and you keep looking to God and you claim your deliverance because God is faithful amen is a faithful God and I just I believe that with all my heart I I'm a witness There Is Power there's power in prayer power and prayer prayer amen may God just just continue to direct us in that I want to just remind you brother Jerry will be here ministering for us this coming Sunday we want to remember him in prayer even as he's traveling up here and also remember myself I will be in Virginia this weekend Services there and just the Lord will just have his way Among Us so if you would just remember those Services as well and God will just move in a very very special way not only there but here also I know that the camp in Louisiana the youth is going on right now we want to continue to remember that in prayer God will just meet free with each and every every need that's gathered there a lot of pressures upon young people in this generation that God still the same God it's still the answer for every situation and every need amen let's just let's go to him in a word of prayer before we open to the word if you'd like to just stand just for a few moments whatever maybe a knee that's on your heart just let it be known before the Lord Heavenly Father Lord we're mindful Lord this evening then we're not alone you said Lord of two or three agree it's touching any one thing it shall be done that those two or three Lord be gathered in your name you would be right in our midst and Lord there's no greater Delight of our heart and Lord that you would walk right here in our midst this evening and Lord is a people and myself we reserve ourselves to you we've not come Lord tonight to be seen we come Lord present Our Lives to you as vessels God that you might minister to our hearts speak to every need that's gathered here Lord those that are streaming by way of the internet or will listen to it Lord will you just minister to the needs of your people whatever that is Lord that's behind that hand that request upon that heart even things that Lord that we may not even be aware of will you just come Lord because just a few words from you is all that we have made we ask it now Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen God bless you let's turn to Joshua chapter 1. Joshua chapter 1. sure is nice coming to church and Son's still out in it people little little things like that just really turned me around I just really enjoy that I don't know I'm sure many of you can testify I don't like when it gets dark at 4 30. feel like I've got a lot more to do in the day and it's dark at 4 30. but I'm glad when that gray sky starts breaking and all that Gloom and all that and the light just keeps pushing in and pushing in and pushing in amen well let's look here in Joshua chapter 1 and verse 1. now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of nun Moses Minister saying Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise and go over this Jordan thou and all this people unto the land which I do give to them even to the children of Israel every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that I have I given unto you I said unto Moses from the Wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the Great River the river Euphrates and all the land of the Hittites and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your Coast so there's no promise that is exempt but every promise in every word belongs to you and me as a believer if God has said it he's already obligated himself to it he's not a man that he should lie he won't go back on his word he's going to have to repent and say you know I didn't foresee certain things coming up no God made a promise and God keeps every promise here's verse 5 and we'll let you be seated there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee what a promise I cannot fail I'll I'll not just I'm not I can't fail go back on any promise and I'll not desert you oh oh glory be to God may God bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I just want to speak just a few moments here as we were talking about inquiring of the Lord we begin to look at that thought last week and I want to move into that here just a little bit more and looking into the Book of Joshua here because you recognize that not only is Joshua a type of the Holy Ghost the comforter the spirit of Truth it also has a type as we see as Believers of the end time messenger and it also holds the type of every Spirit-filled believer brother Branham would call to the believer the spiritual Joshua's and when we recognize as we look in here into the word that we will find as we find in in every part of it that God would would direct us as his children in everything that would be done in the land every battle that would be won would be because that they have sought the counsel and the leadership of almighty God it wasn't a question whether they could win but the question was how what approach do you want us to take not if we're going to win we're already promised victory that's a different way when you come in when coming into the land it's not if we will succeed or is there victory victory is certain but it's following the Lord every step of the way now notice here in verse 6 and these scriptures here not only tonight but in the other times we'll have a lot to to do with some things but verse 6 notice how God would admonish them Joshua because it's one thing to speak to a person and to let them know as I was with Moses so will I be with thee I won't fail you I won't forsake you but now God is speaking now directly to this promise this assurance and now how that a spiritual Joshua is to take their lives be strong and of a good courage For unto this people shall thou divide for an inheritance the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the laws which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest Prosper whether so ever thou goest so Victory is certain but it's victory through and by the word so to take heed to it to observe it to to observe it means to be very to look very carefully look into it and take heed from it don't don't turn from it but face it head on look at the word have the word before you because with that then you your way shall prosper wherever you go notice wherever thou goest so wherever God will lead us we can have a confidence he's leading us not out of the word but he'll always lead us into the word so it'll never be anything that we have to try to stretch and find things like puzzle pieces beating them in place and you know somehow try to vindicate that this is God's will no if we will observe the word in the word is the spirit of God who gave it that he will come forth and guide us and when that leadership comes from just written word to where the word itself now inspired to our lives and we become inspired then we Prosper whether so ever we go in other words our lives are filled with the wisdom of God and what is the wisdom of God it's the Holy Ghost so it's the spirit of God that is leading us and that's what God has given to the Church of the Living God to lead us we were not to be led by our natural senses a lot of things can seem reasonable to us God's letting Joshua know there's going to be a lot of things that don't make sense to the Natural mind but if you will just give yourself to the word the word has within it all that you have need of and that giving ourselves to it let's just step back a moment what would that mean to give ourselves to it it means as we are taking in of the word praying about the word if we can cut in on on Joshua how many times that Joshua would pray and we'll see this in the oncoming times that Joshua would look to the word of God know the promise of God is certain but he's asking God what is your direction into this situation how are we going to take this city so God so Joshua he's looking to God and knowing if I can just give myself to the word then the word has the answer God will speak to my heart he'll come right through that word that then where he leads me no matter if it makes sense to me or not I'm going to be able to stand and my way will be prosperous I I will actually be able to walk in discernment or this word also means to have insight or have that of a discernment regarding the situation and there's no way that we can have discernment without feeding on the word of God when we feed on the word of God the Bible says that you know strong meat belonging to them that are full age whose exercise whose senses are exercised to discern good from Evil how many times that Joshua with no doubt looking into the word would pray over that word and praying over that word and God will move and direct that spiritual Joshua for the need and what he's facing and what he sees before him now look look here in in verse 8 it says this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth that's a big statement there because knowing that this we recognize that the Bible itself is a book of Prophecy this was only speaking to what would come because this book of Joshua it actually speaks of the Spirit-filled believer who is in position in Christ in the Holy Ghost in the word that as a spiritual Joshua as he would say this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth and brother Branham would say it in this way regarding thy mouth he said what you're saying he said just don't read it and walk away but speak it live it and teach it so it's it's an all so the word is not just something that we are passing by we are hearing but the word is that which we are taking in and we are living by that word we are speaking that word and we are teaching that word so and the teaching is not and doesn't have to be you understand not limited to a preacher or a teacher but remember the spirit of God through our lives is an actual witness even in a testimony for how that we would take the word and speak the word now remember when Moses he spoke the word before he ever saw one movement before he ever felt one little bit of wind blow God told him to face the opposition and speak and go forward and there's things that as we speak speak is where we're taking that the word of God and acting on it by faith how many know that the word of God says that he is the high priest of our confession and to know that how Paul would write of that to the spiritual joshuas and and God would have his prophet in this hour and he would say you know he said right now what you might be in a position where you can take it and confess it and he said it might be that that has not dropped all the way down here he said but take that and you keep confessing it until you really do believe it because you know this is a word that a man never spoke if a man spoke this word then you're I could doubt it we could question it but when we know that this is God's word and God has spoken it it won't be a man fulfilleth it'll be God fulfilling his word and if we can just get into that place of the word and go ahead and speak what the word is saying concerning us then he as our high priest can begin to act upon what we are saying in that time oh my I think that's a very powerful reality of where in our life because let's be honest friends there's a lot of things that comes out of our mouth I'm not talking about cussing God delivered us of those things and took that out but you realize when you talk negative brother random said you're talking the devil's language and there's all we are in compass listen with two Realms of our life that are susceptible to negativity because two Realms of us that's all it can see that what we can hear within the Physical Realm and then what we can then move into that spiritual or that that of the mind and we can reason an imagination but there's another realm that's far greater than those other Realms and too many times we live beneath our privileges and we start living out here in these other Realms but we can never be successful we can never make our way prosperous if we live in the other realm but we must live in the realm of faith and I believe their spiritual joshuas that can look at the word and can look at that promise and say God I see this as a promise that you have made for me Lord it's something that's striking my heart right now and I may not have to be able to put my finger on it right now but it's a promise that God is making do you realize that that's something that God will do so that you and I can begin to pray about it there's things that God begins to deal with your heart so that you can begin to pray about it because you're praying for it it shows you mean business with God there's sometimes there's things that'll just drop in our lap in a service and then there's other promises that'll lay right before us and God wants to see how determined and how bad how much do you really want it God will bring us to a place to really asking after him not begging but asking him to fulfill his word oh glory be to God you know how it felt when you know your boy your girl would walk up to you and maybe you know even your wife well let's just put it like this and the pickle jar won't come open and she says here honey oh with your big muscles and you might not have a your muscles might be so puny but oh you reach in there and you get that pickle jar you're praying help me Lord let me loosen it and all you get it loosen and she says thank you thank you honey it's something that kind of just it can make you feel a little good now I know Nana probably some of you are like what are we talking about here but you know even when a little boy a little girl can come to their daddy or Mama and they can say something and they can begin to act on their behalf how much greater is it when we can go to almighty God and say Lord I am not self-sufficient but I am depending on you for every promise of God for you're the one to fulfill it Lord oh glory be to God this shall not depart out of thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then Thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then thus shalt have good success so that that word prosperous there is not the same word as Prosper above but it is a word that means that there will be an advancement or there will be a successful to bring it to a successful issue and there's not one of us that moves in a manner or or should that we're expecting failure because if you're expecting failure remember you only get what you expect as a man thinketh in his heart so is he right and anything that's that's not done in faith is sin is that right so it's where that God himself and remember there's only one source of faith faith don't come from mama daddy or nobody else faith comes from hearing the word of God are you right Mama might have a lot of good things to say Daddy might have a lot of good things to say but Faith cometh by hearing the word of God that's why we must ask and pray oh God Speak to My Heart Lord let me stay in a place that you can speak and minister to me because we realize in our journey we're not always on the up and up or in the times where we feel like shouting or on a Mountaintop but there's times when sickness comes there's times When Trials comes let's just put it simple there's times when our apple cart gets upset and we need a touch and direction from almighty God and God knew this would be here but now as a spiritual Joshua if you will take heed to this and don't let it don't just let the word be something you pass by don't just let it be something that moves past through you but let it be something you speak it you live it and you teach it because by meditating upon the word of God and taking that in dwelling upon that then you shall make your way prosperous there there will be a success and everything we can say that the success itself will be that of the word in our life is that right now truly there's a lot of things that we can say Lord I wouldn't have this job if you didn't leave me if you didn't direct me but we can only say that when we can actually testify that it hasn't taken us away from the word because if it's a job or something else a activity family whatever more if it takes us away from the word then we can't call that the blessing of God right because it'll never lead us outside of the word because when we're inquiring of God to pray about things and remember it doesn't matter how good it feels how good it looks but we always take it back to the word God has told Joshua here that a real spiritual Joshua is one whose life is regulated by the word of God it's observant with you not How Can You observe to do all that's in because there's a desire that's put in your heart to walk pleasing to almighty God that even when it gets hard and and you know you are given choices to go right or to go left but to just stand there at times and and you don't know which way to go but you stand having done all the staff you stand therefore and you look to God and say Lord I know that that's not your will and I know that that's not surreal I don't got to pray about that because it is there's things that's not even according to your word are you hearing me now but sometimes you've got to stand there and you say what do I do while I'm standing well the only way to stand is when you're on your knees praying that's the only way to really stand in the presence of God are you hearing me now because the Bible says do not come up to a high seed lest thou be told go down to the lower one but must you must go to the lower one and then let the king bid you into that place that is a higher sea so when we come to God In Prayer we are coming and looking to the will of God we're not trying to place ourselves or what we're looking at as the will of God but we want to know what is your will Lord oh glory be to God so notice verse 9 have not I commanded thee that that's a big big statement have not I commanded thee who is it that has given you this direction be strong and of the good courage Be not Afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee with us so ever thou goest what a comfort now what we just read here in verses 7 and verse 8. that's a spiritual Direction that's given for good success in a prosperous way all the way through there are battles to fight there are things to be overcome there are needs that are constantly before us to pray about let me just kind of set the stage we've got to be able to take and look at these needs and pray about them with a real faith because without faith prayer is a hope so and prayer is not a hope so prayer is a Divine communication between you and God prayer has to do with promises it has to do with needs it has to do with situations even things that arise in our life that come before us that we don't know exactly what to do but to be in a spirit of prayer do you realize it won't do you much good to even sit down with me or call me if you first have not been in prayer and I know sometimes there's things come up that's so distraught maybe it comes up on a moment's notice or whatever more but let me just say it like this it is important that we are in prayer it's important that we are seeking the mind of almighty God because we want to hear from God now I want you to notice the spiritual direction that Joshua has given in the Bible of numbers 27 this is is very very important because going in to the land we recognize that it's not just something that Joshua is just kind of like on his own and you do what you want to do but there is a direction and a leadership God is a god of order God only he operates by divine order now notice here in the Book of Numbers uh in chapter 8 or 27 and verse 18 right before this verse Moses knows he's going off the scene and Moses says asked God that the people would have a man before them that would be able to go out before him and be able to come in before them that the people be not as sheath without a shepherd now we can see that how what that really as it speaks of that that there as Moses was saying that then it would be the need for a leader one who would be there and there's one leader of the Church of the Living God and that's the Holy Ghost that's God himself remember he said if I go away the comforter cannot come but if I go away I will send the comforter to you and we know that God leads us he'll lead through offices through vessels is that right God will lead through the life of a husband and so forth but remember that leadership itself is not the position but the position should be reserved for the leader himself to guide and direct under the leading of the Holy Ghost is that right because brother Brandon would tell us in the church age book that God does not lead his church by men ruling over men but he said I believe there's men that God has sent to take charge but their leadership is not by that of their own flesh but it's by the Holy Spirit delivering the word so that the church is not led by a man's ideas or man's thoughts upon things but the cherish is led by the mind of Jesus Christ that moves down Among Us oh my what a comfort that is that the Holy Ghost is speaking right here to guide and direct us oh my what a paradox think of this in numbers 27 18 and the Lord said unto Moses take thee Joshua the son of nun a man in whom is the spirit and lay thy hand upon him and set him before Elias or the priest before all the congregation and give him a charge in their sight and thou shalt put some of thine honor upon him that all the congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient notice and he shall stand I want you to take close feed to this verse and he shall stand before Eliezer the priest who shall ask counsel for him after the Judgment of yurum before the Lord oh man at his word shall they go out and that his word shall they come come in both he and all the children of Israel with him even all the congregations so this leadership and Direction when Joshua would say we go out this way it's because that Joshua has gotten his leadership from the word of God flashing forth the direction so when he's saying something he's not saying it with a maybe think out Joshua comes up to the people and says in three days we're going over he didn't say it might open it might happen but he's speaking with the certainty can't you see what it means when we can come to God In Prayer in heaven fellowship and getting ourselves before the word and meditating and praying oh my then there will come an inspiration of the Holy Ghost that brings us certainty with those questions we have believing we need the direction we're to take there comes a certainty from the presence of God oh my you say brother Samuel sometimes why don't it happen well one of the time one thing is we don't always come and we don't always inquire when situations get hard we just we we get away from the word we get away from praying come on now I think if I got a little something like that I'd be asking my wife I'd be asking my husband I'd be calling another brother or sister don't dump them all on don't dump all your problems on them the Bible didn't say dump your cares on them and said cast your cares on him come on Friends if we could go to God in prayer and we're not going there bellyaching but we're saying God this situation right now it is it is bearing upon my spirit it's bearing on my mind but I know that even now Lord whatsoever thou says there's nothing can hinder this come on I'm talking to spiritual joshuas glory be to God and then there's other times we come and we've already got the answer and because we've got the answer the urum don't light up well I'm speaking but it's you're already closed off if you're closed off he can't speak to you but it ought to be in this way let me just say it in where the rubber meets the road it ought to be this way even if you are leaning and feeling that it's like this there still should be to our lives a comma that says God if this is not in the correct channel of your mind then Lord I'm remaining remaining and leaving myself open that you can lead me because the word is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart and I've come tonight Lord I've come in the morning I'll come I I need Lord the thoughts of my heart discerned I need Lord for those questions that are before me I need your leadership now notice here as we see it let me read that again verse 21 and he shall stand before Eliezer the priest who shall ask counsel for him after the Judgment of urum before the Lord and his word they shall go out and on his word they shall come in both he and all the children of Israel with him even all the congregation and Moses did as the Lord commanded him and he took Joshua and he sent him before Eliezer the priest and before all the congregation and he laid his hands upon him and gave him a charge as the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses oh my I just think of that little song that brother Brown sings in one of the last messages he speaks leadership and he sings a song it wasn't just I I sorry I don't believe things are just coincident but in the last song that sung it is till we meet again till we meet again God be with you till we meet again oh hallelujah it's a living God that you and I have not only been introduced to by the Living God we've been United to so that we might walk in that same promise as a spiritual Joshua you see that's the difference that's the difference because you know this is why when the spirit of God would come in this hour and it would deal with you know life's saying well I've been born again but the life don't dally with the word and when the word says this well I don't think you need to do that that's not a spiritual Joshua Paul said let anyone who is a spiritual Joshua acknowledge that the Commandments that I'm writing are the Commandments of the Lord in other words to recognize that I am his messenger I am his spokesman and the thoughts that are here within the word for your life that God is speaking through my life you see a spiritual Joshua that has been born of the spirit of God the spirit of Truth leads us into all truth not away from it see this is where thank God for his Mercy in this hour to bring a certainty in our lives you know some can look at this and they can look at the message and say well the message is hard well you know what standing in the Flames of hell it don't seem too hard because remember it's to be warned that what the church is saying well you can do this you can cut your hair you can do this and you can live any old kind of life oh you can do this you know every time you do it just repent and you know it's all right there ain't nobody can overcome that and and you know it's gotten more wicked but then that might that might be something that they think or they believe and the reason they would do that is because they don't know the Living God are you hearing me friends I'm talking about the Living God that's right here Among Us you can take a life you'd be pressed to find many that would be Sanctified outside in other ranks you'd be really pressed to find out are you hearing me many can look at certain promises and say I've got certain experiences and you can sit there and see their hair bobbed off you can see other things going on and you realize that's not the birth of the Holy Ghost because the new birth will always identify with the word of almighty God because the spirit of God will always submit itself to the word of God amen what shall I do bring Joshua before Eliezer oh my and Ellie easer shall stand there with the Europe there's only one thing that can make this word live and that is the Holy Ghost oh glory be to God so we're not out of Step we're right in step with what God has called us and directed us to do notice in numbers 34 17. these are the names of the men which shall divide the land unto you Eliezer the priest and Joshua the son of none incredible you don't read that in Joshua 1. what it says in Joshua 1 is Thou shalt be strong and courageous For unto this people shalt thou divide the land why would it include Elias or the priest here because the dividing of The Inheritance is by the word are you with me that's why the Holy Ghost it's not just an experience it's a word experience an experience from passing from Death unto life a life can have many experiences but there must be an experience where that life can say I know I'm not the same person that I used to be God has changed my life that's an experience oh my notice this in Joshua 14 1 and these are the countries same statement which the children of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan which elieza the priest and Joshua the son of none notice this unity and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel distributed for inheritance to them so the spirit of God will never lead us outside of the word never you see that's a principle that we should always live by and as Believers we will and if we fail to really inquire from God and look at the word you know sometimes there's things we can make some decisions and haste and sometimes there's decisions you make as you see that you don't always get to just say Lord forgive me you bear those decisions with you it's not God tormenting you but it just goes to show that just because we belong to God does not mean that every decision is going to be somehow on the mark that we go to make this decision and God's going to say no no no no no no no and God just picks us up and steers us the other way but this is where we should be as children of God it's knowing I might be going this way but I still want to keep looking to almighty God because God knows the path that I'm to take and I want to be in the center of his will I don't want to do nothing that's going to hinder down the road is that right oh my but so the spirit of the Lord it will never lead us outside of the word he's the spirit of Truth he comes to lead and guide us into all truth not away from it so remember as a spiritual Joshua this is not where a person gets down to pray and say well you know God has led me you know to go to the Baptist Church no God never LED you to do that well God has led me you know to to do this you can put whatever you want to put in there or God has led me you know to take this job and and all the and you hadn't prayed first of all you hadn't prayed about it oh come on I'm talking about spiritual joshuas that are not just walking around and I feel led I feel those are Pentecostal babies I'm gonna preacher now that's Pentecostal babies well I feel better I feel this or I feel this or I feel this as though if I say I feel you can't touch it but if the word touches it then what you feel better submit to the word because it is the word that has life is that right not I feel not I feel we can have a lot of feelings this morning when I let the dogs out I had a feeling I had a feeling all right when that wind smacked me right in the face I'm feeling all right when the rain hit me it was okay it was a feeling all right but you see our spiritual joshuas were not going by feelings I might feel a certain way but that's not the authority I want to know what does the word say about it well brother Samuel I don't got time listen if we want to be in the will of God we got time to say Lord what do you say about this if Paul would go down into the desert of Arabia for three years and he searched out the experience that he had right there he wanted to see that experience in the word what was it a spiritual Joshua because his spiritual Joshua knows his experience is of god it's a word experience that it's placed in the word then the channel of divine communication is opened mama mama oh glory be to God is present to vindicate it to override it see this is where it comes into that place to say Lord help me just to follow and to lord always put the word first because you see this is the ministry right here of Joshua of the Holy Ghost In Our Lives it's a Ministry of divine Vindication not only has God revealed something to us but he's there vindicating what he's revealed like the witness that came to Abel there's a witness that's moving in our life there's a living of that word there's a there's the proving of that word it's it's being lived out through our lives you understand what I'm saying just to agree with the message is not living it through your life just to know that brother Brahm is a prophet is not not with Divine vindication are you hearing me but remember as a spiritual Joshua you must go all the way with the word it's not enough even for our life to come to know that I've been brought out of Egypt and then there's a sanctifying in their life I no more smoke I know more drink I know any more do marijuana I know more Lester no more running around here and no more do this but all of that is preparation for the promise all of those are things right there that you are laying aside because you are expecting and looking for the promise you hear what I'm saying so it's not just enough sometimes I'm afraid sometimes that some some get comfortable with well you know I'll tell you what I was an awful bad rascal you might have been an awful bad Rascal but you may not be completely changed yet because when you're changed there is a real fire on the inside of your life it's not duck and indulging the word and well I'll bathe this one and I don't obey this one I'm talking about when there is that going on listen friends that's not to put anybody down but let's stand before the urum let's get before the lair because we want a word experience the Rapture is not for those who associate with a message or can agree with it or believe it it's for those who have become the message [Applause] then we're looking into the message then there's a relationship we're feeding on the word of God so it's placing with Joshua it's putting the word first I want you to think about this here when Joshua came down in Joshua three after he sends the spies out in Joshua too he already knows the land it belongs to him the report he hears that comes back in Joshua 2. I'm going to touch that tonight he already that's that's a testimony of what God already said where fear has fallen upon them but now in order to take that promise there must be the word that is placed first so now what God has instructed Joshua to do now he comes into the application of it and remember Joshua we looked at that on that Sunday sometime ago here of how when he came down to the Jordan he was at a time that it didn't make sense to cross it you see the word of God will ask you and I to do things that don't make sense I'm going to preach just as it's coming to me right now because I'm not going to apologize for it sometimes the word asks us to do things that our feelings don't want to do what will my family think if I don't do this they might think I'm not a real good friendly Lovie Debbie Christian if I don't do this I'll tell you what they'll think if you'll stand with the word and say no I can't do that because if I do that that's going to take me away from the word I'll tell you what they'll do they'll respect you because there's a backbone to stand on the word of God this all packed in here didn't know but it's been unpacked it's kind of like my wife when she puts some nice treats in my bag and packs it and I get them out in the hotel and say glory be glory be she included some of these things for me now these may not be glory be statements but they were actually they'll help you and I because putting the word first there are things that God will ask us to do that absolutely goes against our emotions you think the Lord Jesus wasn't tempted to heal everybody there at the pool of Bethesda one laying here stepping up pardon me stepping over that one stepping over that one stepping over that one brother Adam said human compassion would have healed every one of them but Godly compassion knew there was one who was there and stepped over this one over that one over this one over this one until it got to the one who was there do you understand if we can see that in that way we have not been brought here by human compassion human endowments it has been Godly compassion that God did not have on us because we deserved it we did not deserve the mercy of God we did not deserve the love of God he came looking for me [Music] [Applause] it doesn't make sense but if you put the word first well brother Samuel show me a chapter where it's written about the pool of Bethesda when you come to the pool of Bethesda chapter 5 and verse 33. maybe that's in the book of second opinions some of y'all heard that song The Book of second opinions when I heard that a brother sent that to one night I started listening I said dear Lord ain't that the truth if you ain't heard it you need to hear it you get a good kick out of it because sometime or another we've got our our new translation of the Bible and somehow it's got two two opinions in it or two Corinthians or second opinions in it but sometimes putting the word first is not something that's wrote out here Joshua couldn't there was not a chapter on how to cross the Jordan there's sometimes there's things in our life that we come to and we don't know how to face them as a spiritual Joshua I can say Amen to that don't know how to face it whether it's in our life in my home in the church probably my own life I don't know how to face it but I have confidence in the God who gave his word that he's still the same yesterday today and forever and if I can just get my thoughts out of the way sometimes with praying the biggest part of prayer is getting myself out of the way because sometimes they answer many times the answer doesn't even come when I'm on my knees or laying on my face or walking there and praying sometimes the answer doesn't even come right then you say brother Samuel what's all that sometimes that's just really getting us out of the way really praying until we're actually able to look in the mirror as we ought to look in the mirror and say you know Lord I realize this is my thoughts on it this is my feelings on it but Lord what do you say about it what do you say about this Lord you see in those times I think about and I'm just going to pull this up here tonight and close I think about how but Dr Sam Adair he came to brother Branham now you might look at this request and you know about it you might look at it and say well what what does that have to do with the promises of God well it has everything because don't forget God said when you have forsaken houses mothers lands Etc I will give you them in this lifetime and the lifetime to come you know how brother Brandon puts that in the message forsaking all because remember Peter asked himself Lord what will we get brother Brown says it like this I love it he said you know Jesus ain't going to be outdone the glory be to God no you ain't gonna outdo Jesus it ain't like the the relative the uncle he's going to one-up you at his wedding or his daughter's wedding you don't want nothing man they're going to bring instead of limousines they're going to bring chariots with horses one up one up one up no you're not going to outdo Jesus Dr Sam Adair here he was he said brother Branham I said Billy he said I need he said this lot has come open it's the only listen it's the only lot that I can think of in this city the Earth it's the only place that I can see where a clinic can go he said I've come to pray because let's go let's go pray they got down and prayed when they got it from praying where the brand told him said that ain't the place but the place that you're going to get and the clinic is this building right over here of this certain brick building on the street or whatever I remember seeing it when I was there a few years ago and he said that's the one you're going to get and remember what Dr Sam Adair said to him he said Billy it can't be that thing is locked up in court for 25 years he said I have tried to get it oh boy we could really preach this right now it's it's just like notice he tried to get it there's some things that we try to get and God lets us see that on our own human efforts we can't do it but even on things like this and he said now what's he doing saying in twits all tied up in court for 25 years he's speaking according to the senses that are there but he's not looking through faith but God has a prophet that's there that's able to see that's where you're going to Clinic it's going to be oh my and brother Graham said the only thing I know to tell you is you just believe it next morning next morning next morning next morning Billy he said I'm like the freeze to death over here what's the matter I just signed the papers for that clinic [Applause] it makes a difference when we inquire of the Lord and Joshua was one who inquired of the Lord to start it the word was going to be first oh I tell you friends these are the these are the kind of people that we want to be these are the kind of people people that follows according to the word of God this is why brother Branham would take in the church age book and brother Brandon would speak and he would talk about why the confusion has come around with the baptism of the Holy Ghost brother Ram you know in every age he lays that right in it just keeps on building and building and building and building Brother Brad makes a statement and I know there's no doubt probably people that's taken this off this way or whatever more but when brother Brown makes a statement and he says the problem for all this confusion is summed up in one word experience he said people have taken experiences instead of the word but he says we must go back to the Plumb line now brother Graham was not saying that a person doesn't need an experience but he's letting it be known that if it's in a word experience it's experienced from Death unto life well you might shout you might speak in tongues you might run I I don't know you you may you may not do none of that but the one thing about it is your soul has moved from Death unto life and it will be a life that the word itself will testify just like Jesus could say if you don't believe me believe it works out believe what you see coming through my life because it's an experience of the word you know how we need his leading in every in every part of our life it doesn't become less as we we get older in life you know as you get older and walking with the Lord you realize just how insufficient you really are and how much we really need you can look back on decisions and things that's come about in your life right now and you can look at things no credits you can take but you can say God help thank you for giving me Grace to be sensitive how that was done Lord I don't know you know sometimes we don't even realize maybe have the word has come to bring an influence Upon Our Life of who we're to marry or this or that and we don't even realize well how did this happen but you know as you're feeding on the word of God you're taking in the word observing to do all that he has said that word to observe means to look into it just take it in and as you're taking that end and knowing that as it's in thy mouth you're speaking it living it teaching you just so wrapped up in it then everything that the word has because let me tell you something your spouse as a real believer it's not outside the word it's in the word are you with me that's why I think uh brother Shane I may get this wrong the train sent me something years ago and I really liked it he said your mate ought to be so deep in Jesus you got how do I remember the exact words you got to look so deep in Jesus to find him you're just focused in that let me say that that ain't just about your mate that's about your job with your children with everything if friends if we will take this approach with everything in our life and really inquire of the Lord taking in of the word praying and just the answer don't come while we're on our knees don't don't get don't get down God answers prayer when you're sincere God can bring it right across the pulpit God can bring it right while you're listening to the message in your sincere God will answer let's pray Heavenly Father Lord Jesus thank you for your mercy Lord we look at this knowing as you've been even speaking to our hearts and some of the Sunday services and how that Lord we are in a place just like this Lord another Ephesians and here we stand Lord is spiritual joshuas Lord God all throughout or the building the internet and other places Lord may I pray I would ask first Lord if there's one that doesn't know you in that real personal way may they Lord just take the Simplicity that you've spoke tonight that God as they would come before that word give themselves to you Lord and with the strength and the power of almighty God that Lord is moving to draw upon their life they can lay down every habit they can lay aside every week and every sin that does so easily be said they can lay it down by the authority of almighty God Lord they can invite and say Lord I want that leadership in my life may you grant that Lord May granted Lord to hearts and lives if it's never come to that place if it's only been an emotion Lord and my I'm not against emotion Lord I'm probably Lord just considered to be an emotional guy in many regards but I just I just love you Lord I don't know how else to express it sometimes Lord I I know I even get beside myself Lord I'm out there in the yard or at home driving I know I'm not the only one but it ain't by emotion Lord but it's by an experience Lord we're a person has met you face to face like Joshua he would come before Ellie's or before the euro oh God there stands Lord the word to know that God that you bring a word experience in our life you you don't produce Lord where it's a life that's back and forth in the world and out of the world no no that's that that's not what the word produces but may they Lord just invite and say Lord let the blood go deeper in my life let it go down to that Realm where there comes a complete transformation oh God may they take the grace of God that nor maybe has wooed them Lord and moved them back lord moved them out of thoughts about and Lord things that maybe they've Lord been caught up in and Lord but may they recognize it's it's Grace that's coming Lord God their life might be United and yoked you the word the word father all throughout this building those that streaming on and on Lord we have before us many responsibilities decisions things of life and Lord We Believe dear God that you care and Papa we we don't want our own thoughts on it we want to know what do you think about it what do you say oh God a spiritual Joshua's Lord we want to follow you help us God I'm asking you to help each and every one of us Lord when the way he would get rough dreary decisions become times Lord greater and times the Lord decisions we just can't snap right off but it's things Lord we have to take before you in prayer God I pray if there's one thing that we would take out of this service Lord God here tonight I believe what you tried to get to us Lord is to really inquire of you because the Lord Jesus really really want our way to be prosperous not not more money no but prosperous in you that God to know that whatever you lead us to do then we can have a confidence and we can trust you that that even when times get rough and they get hard that you're the one who opened the door and you're the one who's leading us you'll never lead us where your grace can't keep us but you'll give us strength Lord you'll make a way that our life our spiritual walk does not diminish but it will continue to increase because that's what real Prosperity is is the success of the spirit of God moving through our life I think of how your Prophet could stand there in the message of the token and he could speak and testify he said the Lord Jesus himself he has had more success in the ministry he's given me than he did in his own Earthly Ministry and he drew us back he said notice I said he had more success Lord that's what we count as success it's not our gaining of this and gaining of that oh there's things in life Lord that you give us like Paul could say enjoy those things that God has given us things the Lord sometimes you give us we don't deserve we didn't Merit it we didn't earn it Lord but you do it just because you can do it and Lord we thank you for every every blessing but Lord most of all the desire that burns in our hearts is we want to continue to grow into that stature of a perfect man Lord as your Prophet could stand at the end of that message and say I trust that this congregation and myself with them will pledge that we will not stop but we will seek and pray until we see every one of these virtues flowing through my life and our lives together Lord God knowing that there is a growing a maturing spiritual success if there's any success to be had in Samuel's life and his success Lord in any other life that they can put their put their name to it let it be that it's the success of the Lord Jesus [Music] that he's the one that has helped me to get myself my greatest enemy out of the way so that he can have a good time so that the Lord can have a good time he can have good success help us Lord help us to Lord make every decision put it before you in prayer Lord knowing that the parts of our our natural makeup Lord sometimes we we feel so pressured sometimes we feel in such a hurry I think of it Lord when one brother had spoke to me looking for a home [Music] and Lord where the things we're going with the housing market expressed expressed to me Lord some time ago said by the time we find out if there's a house on the market there's already bids they're wanting you to make a bid before you ever go to it and this is what they said out of their mouth I don't like that because I want to pray over it I want to know what does God say about it Lord Jesus in situations in times like that I don't know I can't explain it but I believe God that Lord even in situations like that that you give us Lord such a special Grace the Lord God moving in fellowship with you that even in those times that we can look and say this is not normally the time frame that I would move in but it's the dove of the holy spirit that would move in that would give us such rest such peace say I'm leading you Lord we don't know we don't know Lord we we need you Lord I'm thankful that we can come to you in prayer you don't look at a need that we bring before you and say really Samuel you mean you would ask me pray about Lord over years ago when I would pray about Lord a vehicle what do I do Lord you don't come to me you don't say Samuel really you would pray to me about that no but Lord I know that you can see the future you know what we have need of or may have wants but you know what I need Lord God you know the desire of my heart I believe that's the desire of every other believer if it's something if I could have it but if it would hinder and get in the way of you I don't want it I don't want it I don't want it Lord I value your presence Lord too much I value Lord being in your will I value Lord your visitation I don't need and want to be weighed down with things Lord on my mind like that Lord and yet Lord we have pressures we have cares of life we have things that Lord that we're faced with that sometimes seems so great but Lord the difference is those are things when they come things that Lord that we never anticipated maybe it's not a reflection of a decision we made or something we did or failed to do God I'm so glad that in everything that we can look to you Lord granted Lord Jesus [Music] I'll tell you right here tonight as he brings it to my heart as our heads are bowed right here tonight whatever the need is that would be upon your heart maybe it's receiving the Holy Ghost I
