[34:59] opportunity to come together a man and
[35:02] to worship him and to hear from him this
[35:05] morning and just to invite him to move
[35:07] in a special way Amen in each of our
[35:09] lives and I believe that's what we've
[35:12] gathered here I just want to say as well
[35:14] just kind of on the tales of other
[35:16] things it's been mentioned Happy
[35:18] Father's Day to all the fathers amen
[35:21] that are out there and if you have your
[35:23] your father still here with you it'd be
[35:26] a good thing to really let him know
[35:28] amen and to give him a good hug I wish I
[35:31] could give my dad a hug
[35:33] yeah you know on a days like this and on
[35:35] times of course it's not just days like
[35:37] this there's many things right now that
[35:39] I come through many different times
[35:40] which dad was here right now I'd like to
[35:42] ask him about this I'd like to
[35:45] uh you know it's something about it you
[35:48] know with our our fathers when they've
[35:50] passed through certain Journeys
[35:53] and experiences in their lives and uh
[35:57] you know and that's something that's
[35:58] just so precious and we just God bless
[36:01] you each and every one because we
[36:04] certainly thank God for his grace in
[36:06] that also uh brother uh I don't even
[36:09] think that he's here this morning but uh
[36:12] so I have to maybe wait and do that on
[36:14] another time but I think is Matthew
[36:16] Bosley here
[36:18] this morning not here this morning well
[36:21] anyhow we'll have to make sure that
[36:22] that's done even next week or I'll get
[36:25] it when I get back but uh certainly
[36:28] brother Matthew he has graduated there
[36:30] from high school and we certainly
[36:32] appreciate that
[36:39] so we just God bless you thank you
[36:41] musicians I want to as we prepare to
[36:45] turn on the word of the Lord I just ask
[36:46] you to remember remember me in prayer
[36:49] this coming week
[36:51] fly to or I'll be flying to Australia
[36:53] for a youth a youth meeting and it'll be
[36:57] from
[36:58] pretty much when I hit the ground till
[37:00] when I leave and come back so only be
[37:04] gone just about a week actually a little
[37:05] bit more than that but they're a day
[37:07] ahead of time so we'll try to get in
[37:11] from that and uh
[37:13] then I just asked for your prayers
[37:15] because we have that and then I'm here
[37:17] for a week and then I've got a few
[37:19] services in the midweek I've got the byc
[37:22] in the morning so I certainly covet your
[37:25] prayers not just in strength in my body
[37:27] but God will just move in a special way
[37:30] I tell you I know a lot of people may
[37:32] want I've had other brothers say oh my
[37:34] you know if going to Australia
[37:37] and I said it I said look if you feel it
[37:40] on your heart I'll stand behind you
[37:41] because to me I don't like traveling
[37:43] things might be very beautiful but I'm
[37:45] I'm a guy that you know I like being I
[37:48] like being home and it's not just being
[37:51] home it's just there's there's things
[37:52] that you know uh within it I that's so
[37:56] there's a lot of times with the trip and
[37:57] you know I'm not interested in a trip
[37:59] I'd rather much more do other things
[38:02] than just setting for 20 some hours so
[38:06] uh I just covet your prayers and we want
[38:08] to see God move God knows what he's
[38:11] doing you know and sometimes the way the
[38:13] way that God chooses things I I don't
[38:15] even try I don't try to figure it out I
[38:17] don't try to explain it how God and why
[38:19] God would take a vessel from one place
[38:22] in the world and bring them here I don't
[38:24] even understand it from across the state
[38:26] God take one vessel bring another vessel
[38:29] and hear through that vessel God speaks
[38:31] something and it just quickens something
[38:33] in a life why is that that's God's
[38:35] Sovereign working it had nothing to do
[38:37] with the vessel it's all God
[38:39] and so we just I covet your prayers and
[38:42] asked that God just really pour out his
[38:45] spirit amen among the young people that
[38:47] are there and so brother Ronnie long
[38:50] will be here on Thursday and then
[38:51] brother Nathan Erickson will be here on
[38:53] Sunday and so I I know that you will be
[38:56] will be blessed and so we just want to
[38:59] look to the Lord amen uh let's go here
[39:03] to Second Peter chapter 1 verse 12.
[39:09] and I want to read just that one verse
[39:11] of scripture again
[39:13] that we began looking at
[39:16] last
[39:18] week
[39:30] Peter here
[39:32] writing
[39:34] under inspiration
[39:36] he says wherefore
[39:38] I will not be negligent to put you
[39:41] always in remembrance of these things
[39:45] though you know them
[39:47] and be established in the present truth
[39:51] I want you just to think of this there's
[39:54] though you know these things and there's
[39:56] certain things that Peter is speaking of
[39:58] then you see it in the preceding
[40:00] scriptures which I'm not going to touch
[40:02] on this morning
[40:04] and be established in the present truth
[40:07] that's very very important is to be
[40:10] established not in the past but be
[40:14] established in the present truth the
[40:17] scripture said walk in the lightest he's
[40:20] in the light
[40:21] then the blood of Jesus Christ his son
[40:24] cleanses us from all unrighteousness
[40:27] so we know that God is light is that
[40:29] right and so the light is God
[40:31] Illuminating God by his life
[40:34] Illuminating and that also is the
[40:36] revealing of the blood that's his Spirit
[40:39] coming among his children and so we to
[40:42] be established in the present truth and
[40:45] I can't think there'd be no greater
[40:47] desire in our hearts than to be
[40:49] established in present truth and that
[40:52] word established I read this to you last
[40:54] week but if you permit me just to read
[40:56] it once again the word established it
[40:59] means to establish or establish or be
[41:02] steadfastly set it's to make stable
[41:05] place firmly or set Fast Fix to set
[41:11] one's face steadfastly to keep the
[41:13] faiths turned and to strengthen make
[41:18] firm to render constant confirm in one's
[41:22] mind now there's many different uh ways
[41:25] within this same word as you see me
[41:27] reading here that can take it in the
[41:29] scripture but if we can say it like this
[41:31] there's a Resolute within the heart of a
[41:34] person it's where you've you're stable
[41:37] there's you know wins can come but down
[41:40] beneath you're stable
[41:43] situations can arise but there is a
[41:45] stability that's in your life and the
[41:48] face being steadfastly set and I
[41:51] referenced this the last time is like
[41:53] when the Lord Jesus was going he was
[41:55] going in the Fulfillment of the word of
[41:58] God and he had his face set to Jerusalem
[42:01] he was ready there was nothing that was
[42:04] going to deter him I believe that that's
[42:07] where the holy spirit continues to move
[42:09] in our lives as we walk on with the Lord
[42:12] is we it's not just something that just
[42:15] happens but we have to give ourselves to
[42:18] it and seeing the hour we're in seeing
[42:20] the the need and even in our lives and
[42:23] seeing within everything is where Satan
[42:26] would love to get our sights distracted
[42:30] on other things
[42:32] you may remember even Peter said oh not
[42:35] so Lord they're not going to do this to
[42:37] you and the Lord Jesus looked around and
[42:40] said get thee behind me Satan for thou
[42:43] art and offense unto me what was what
[42:46] was Satan trying to do was trying to get
[42:49] him to turn aside from the purpose that
[42:52] he was here upon Earth for
[42:54] amen but we thank God for his grace Amen
[42:58] to be established Amen in him let's just
[43:01] let's just go to him in a word of prayer
[43:03] this morning Heavenly Father Lord we
[43:06] thank you for these moments that you
[43:09] allow us to have and be gathered in your
[43:11] presence we pray that God that you'll
[43:13] just take control Lord in this in this
[43:17] service Lord may you just Lord anoint
[43:20] these lips of clay anoint our ears and
[43:23] our hearts Lord may you move Among Us in
[43:25] a very special way this morning Lord
[43:28] you're the one who knows the needs Lord
[43:30] of your children Lord there's things the
[43:33] Lord that you place Lord on my heart and
[43:36] things that come upon my heart but Lord
[43:38] you know Lord how everything is to be
[43:41] placed you know what needs to be said
[43:43] and Lord most of all Lord God that you
[43:46] just move Lord right up next to every
[43:49] heart and every life Lord and just make
[43:52] yourself Lord more real lord to each of
[43:54] our lives and may we walk out of this
[43:57] building Lord this morning Lord should
[43:59] you tarry Lord established and more
[44:02] established oh God in you father Lord we
[44:06] just give ourselves to you now Lord in
[44:09] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[44:11] amen God bless you as you're being
[44:13] seated
[44:15] amen I I want to
[44:19] just look at this this word and this
[44:21] this thought
[44:23] um
[44:24] just something that just resonating on
[44:27] my heart since somewhat in the first
[44:29] parts of May and just looking at it not
[44:32] knowing if we were going to speak on
[44:34] these things or not but just seeing even
[44:37] the need within this hour
[44:40] I believe that it's the objective
[44:43] of the Gospel is the is that there would
[44:46] be the establishment of the believer in
[44:49] Christ that's that's the goal is that we
[44:51] would be established in Christ and we
[44:53] would continue to be strengthened and
[44:56] continue to mature and grow in him it's
[45:01] something beware that in our lives you
[45:03] know from day to day sometimes and month
[45:06] to month we maybe don't see changes in
[45:09] our life but you just look over a little
[45:11] period of time and you can see how
[45:13] things change within your life over
[45:15] pictures and things like that and
[45:17] sometimes those aren't Pleasant places
[45:19] maybe to be able to visit because you
[45:22] realize oh my things are changing you
[45:25] know but when we recognize that within
[45:28] in it all that there's things that in
[45:30] our lives I trust that we're able to
[45:32] look back across our life and say I'm
[45:35] not the same person that I was before
[45:40] that God is moving God is working and
[45:43] I'm I'm I'm there's not only a different
[45:46] person but I'm I'm further up the road
[45:48] by his grace and things that where he's
[45:50] brought me through and that's always a
[45:52] comfort and encouragement because it
[45:54] shows you God's working in spite of what
[45:58] your thoughts are about things and
[46:01] that's what's very important and so
[46:03] God's desire is to bring us into that
[46:05] rightful position of every every son and
[46:08] daughter of God and I want to go to a
[46:10] scripture here in Luke chapter 6 and
[46:12] verse 46
[46:14] a common scripture reading we can find
[46:17] it even in the Book of Matthew but I
[46:19] want to bring it with the wording that
[46:21] is wrote here in verse 46 of Luke of
[46:24] Luke chapter six why call ye me Lord
[46:27] Lord and do not the things which I say
[46:31] whosoever cometh to me and heareth my
[46:35] sayings and do with them I will show you
[46:38] to whom he is like now notice coming to
[46:42] him hearing him and doing what he's
[46:45] saying
[46:46] now he's going to show us this what this
[46:49] man is like he's like a man which built
[46:52] a house and dig deep and laid the
[46:56] foundation on a rock and when the flood
[47:00] arose the stream beat vehemently upon
[47:03] that house and could not shake it for it
[47:06] was founded upon a rock but he that
[47:11] heareth and doeth not now here we have a
[47:15] contrast want both are hearing but now
[47:19] the second part is not doing what is
[47:22] being heard
[47:23] is like a man that without a foundation
[47:27] built and house upon the Earth against
[47:31] which the stream did beat vehemently and
[47:34] immediately it fell and the ruin of that
[47:38] house was great
[47:40] and I when we take of this scripture can
[47:43] we think of this here I you know my my
[47:46] my heart and my mind goes into that
[47:48] example that brother Brandon would talk
[47:50] about of that bridge that was built
[47:52] there in Sydney Australia where that
[47:55] there was a need to connect those two
[47:57] portions of land but they needed
[48:00] somebody to build a bridge that could
[48:03] that could span that and not just
[48:04] something that would go from one point
[48:06] to another but something that would
[48:09] actually hold something that would be
[48:12] solid something that would be able to
[48:15] handle the traffic and when I began to
[48:18] look at all of that brother Bram goes
[48:19] into it but I begin to look at it on my
[48:21] own and you find that when the man built
[48:24] this bridge matter of fact he built
[48:25] multiple bridges in Australia this man
[48:28] himself it was there would be four lanes
[48:30] of traffic on it and two lanes and two
[48:34] parts of it for rails one rail coming
[48:36] one rail going one rail coming talking
[48:39] about railroad cars and and a path for
[48:41] people to walk on and with bikes so
[48:43] we're talking a very massive wide bridge
[48:47] and the loads that would have to be on
[48:49] it and remember they there there was a
[48:52] need to build this bridge and brother
[48:53] Brahm kind of goes into the background
[48:55] of it and you can read about this that
[48:57] you know in order to actually build the
[49:00] bridge they had a choice they could
[49:01] either take a cheap route somebody that
[49:04] would just build it cheaply or they
[49:06] could take a route that it's going to
[49:08] cost them quite a bit and but when they
[49:11] chose that route it was going to cost
[49:12] them with this particular engineer but
[49:15] that man went down there and he blew off
[49:17] all the sand he because he had built
[49:20] upon sand just shifts you you know how
[49:22] it is when you could build a sand castle
[49:25] or you can build something in the sand
[49:26] in the beach out there in Lake on
[49:29] Lakeview Beach and you let the water
[49:31] come in pretty soon it'll wash
[49:33] everything away yeah it's only something
[49:36] that you could point out and say well I
[49:38] I know at one time I built a sandcastle
[49:40] so there but there's no evidence that
[49:42] remains that anything was there or you
[49:45] can take a wind that can come along and
[49:47] you know you heard of sandstorms it
[49:49] could just blow it anyway because sand
[49:52] was never meant to be a source of
[49:55] building anything on let me just tell
[49:58] you there's a part of you and I that is
[50:01] sand and that part within you and I as
[50:03] Mortals is that of that of our reasoning
[50:07] of our spirit realm because reasoning
[50:10] can shift and reasoning yet within the
[50:13] Mind itself remember brother Ram tells
[50:16] us the biggest part of our faith is
[50:19] intellectual faith and he would tell us
[50:22] this is how it works his faith Express
[50:23] he would tell us don't throw that
[50:26] intellectual Faith away he said for if
[50:29] you just would take a hold of that and
[50:31] continue to nurse upon the promises of
[50:34] God it will lead you to that faith of
[50:38] the Living God and so you know brother
[50:40] bam talked about the adopted baby and
[50:43] all of those things and and how that you
[50:45] know as someone who can't have a child
[50:47] the adopt a babysit and eventually after
[50:50] they've adopted that baby here they are
[50:52] they they have a child and we've seen
[50:54] that and here was a man that dug down to
[50:57] a foundation and when he when it came
[51:00] time to test this uh uh Bridge he had
[51:04] blasted he had sent dynamite and blasted
[51:06] it away and got down on the Rock and
[51:08] when it came time to walk across on that
[51:10] right there he was out in front and he
[51:13] told him I want every I want every lane
[51:15] filled I want locomotions on this and he
[51:18] was out in front because he was going to
[51:21] display that what I have declared and
[51:24] built I am here standing as a witness of
[51:28] what I have built and you see God
[51:30] himself when God gave his word and
[51:33] remember God is the word god came down
[51:35] himself and he just didn't send his word
[51:38] down like a trial like a scientist in a
[51:40] lab but God himself came down and took
[51:44] upon the fume and form and he stood and
[51:46] he let you and I know I will show to you
[51:49] I will lead you back to Victory and to
[51:52] show to you and how the very Assurance
[51:54] of the word of God a place where you and
[51:57] I could stand where Satan had moved him
[51:59] in the beginning from the word but here
[52:01] he came in a place to be able to
[52:04] establish the word none in a building
[52:06] somewhere because then remember there
[52:09] was a time where the ark went into the
[52:11] holiest of holies but that was only a
[52:14] time that God desired to establish his
[52:18] word in the very heart of the end
[52:21] individual
[52:22] now when we look at how Faith itself
[52:25] within it all Faith displays itself in
[52:29] how in that it hears and it acts and I I
[52:33] say it like this if there's no action
[52:35] upon what you're hearing then there's
[52:37] nothing moving and nothing transpiring
[52:40] an action doesn't mean altogether just
[52:42] saying well agreeing with it but it's
[52:45] allowing the word to come through your
[52:47] life and and giving yourself to the word
[52:49] praying over the word when you see your
[52:52] shortcomings and you see things that the
[52:54] holy spirit is bringing out in your life
[52:56] don't make excuses for it don't allow
[52:59] sand to to become a resting place but go
[53:03] to God In Prayer who in his infinite
[53:05] Mercy is speaking to your heart and
[53:07] dealing with your life and say God let
[53:10] it be Lord in my life Lord let that word
[53:12] become flesh inside of my life this is
[53:16] an ongoing walk with God this is not a
[53:20] walk with God where you have a One-Shot
[53:22] ill and you sit down and you wait until
[53:25] the change of the body
[53:27] that is not what the Rapture is about
[53:30] but it is a continual growing and
[53:33] maturing in Jesus Christ
[53:37] good morning
[53:38] that's what this word come to do a
[53:41] foundation is Lay but remember after
[53:43] what I just read to you a man who the
[53:46] man who hears who hears it who comes to
[53:49] him and he builds up and and he actually
[53:51] takes up on the word and does it he
[53:54] hears a man who built his house on a
[53:57] solid foundation but he just didn't have
[53:59] a foundation he built a house and so the
[54:02] whole part is that within that
[54:03] Foundation is that there would be a
[54:06] place that could solely rest
[54:08] when I was in Arizona and I just looked
[54:10] it up here early this morning it came
[54:12] back to me and I had some brothers that
[54:14] shared with me on some things that had
[54:16] taken place in a development in Utah and
[54:18] I looked at it here this morning and
[54:20] here you find that there were builders
[54:23] that had built on the on the edge of um
[54:26] you know like a a cliff a rock formation
[54:28] and they built there and one was a
[54:31] million dollar house another was 875 000
[54:34] home and both of these homes they had to
[54:37] remove the people in November and then
[54:41] by the time here after this somewhere
[54:43] just a month down the road the rolling
[54:44] of the the few part uh within the uh the
[54:48] year then they had to completely you
[54:50] know the houses just went right over the
[54:51] edge but what the people started
[54:54] noticing they started seeing cracks and
[54:56] I know they're settling that takes place
[54:58] but this was beyond settling there was
[55:00] cracks and everything all around the
[55:02] house in the in the flooring and
[55:04] everything that was going on and
[55:06] eventually they said hey this is not
[55:08] place that's suitable to dwell in I'm
[55:11] just going to say this to you right now
[55:13] when God builds a house they're in no
[55:17] cracks coming in that house
[55:19] when man builds a house there can be a
[55:22] lot of cracks come in it when we try to
[55:24] do it in our own self there's a lot of
[55:26] cracks can come in it but when God
[55:28] builds a house
[55:30] heavens and earth will pass away but my
[55:33] words shall never pass away because he
[55:36] said Upon This Rock I will build my
[55:40] church and the Gates of Hell shall not
[55:42] be able to Prevail against it why he's
[55:45] established
[55:48] now I want to just deal with this on how
[55:51] faith is
[55:52] faith is a substance faith is acting on
[55:56] what God is speaking his presence moving
[55:58] about our lives
[56:00] brother Ram says it like this he said we
[56:02] find he's talking about for healing he
[56:05] said we find most people are afraid to
[56:07] accept it and usually people who have
[56:10] faith is someone who has experienced
[56:13] faith so to have faith is usually
[56:17] someone who's experienced Faith well how
[56:19] did you experience faith if Faith itself
[56:22] has a source and that source is God
[56:25] when Moses got in the face of the
[56:27] burning bush he had an experience
[56:31] it was different than what his mama had
[56:33] told him because when his mama had told
[56:35] him and he could explain it real well
[56:37] but when push come to shove Moses's
[56:40] Faith boom it exploded it came into a
[56:44] crisis moment like oh what's going on
[56:46] why because it didn't happen the way
[56:50] that he thought it ought to happen you
[56:53] know what he was missing and experience
[56:56] with God
[56:58] people who have faith is someone who has
[57:00] experienced faith and when you accept
[57:02] Jesus as your personal savior there's
[57:04] not a way in the world for you to ever
[57:06] be saved only by your faith you had to
[57:10] accept it you had to believe it you
[57:13] could get down to the Altar and could
[57:15] cry all night long you could beat upon
[57:18] the Altar and scream until you could
[57:20] scream no more and still you're not
[57:22] saved you could feel real good and run
[57:25] all over the building shouting and still
[57:28] not be saved the devil can beat you
[57:31] around the stump on your feelings now
[57:33] I'm not going to ask you to raise your
[57:35] hand
[57:36] the devil could beat you around the
[57:39] stump on your feelings
[57:41] if I had to go now this brother but I'm
[57:43] talking if I had to go on by my feelings
[57:45] there'd be many times that I'd be all
[57:48] out of condition
[57:50] so you mean to tell me brother Branham
[57:53] that there's times that what you're
[57:55] acting on is certainly not your feelings
[57:57] if we could dive into this right here
[58:00] it's showing that there there might be
[58:02] times we feel really good feel on top of
[58:05] the mountain but we're not acting by
[58:07] that I know sometimes you think you are
[58:10] but you're not acting by that a real
[58:12] believer acts from a source that is
[58:15] hidden in an unseen Realm
[58:19] yeah
[58:20] because if you act by your feelings oh
[58:23] he said I'd be all out of condition
[58:26] and I don't rest on my feelings
[58:29] I rest upon the unconditional word of
[58:33] the Living God who made the Covenant
[58:35] with me if I would believe it it's not
[58:37] what I feel it's what I believe Jesus
[58:41] never did say did you feel it he said
[58:44] did you believe it Faith happens it's
[58:48] far beyond feeling I think that's a
[58:51] point to be emphasized Faith happens
[58:54] it's far beyond feeling
[58:56] just because you say well I don't feel
[58:59] anything what does feeling have to do
[59:01] with receiving the word
[59:03] God is speaking to your heart reach out
[59:06] and take that word and say thank you
[59:08] Lord and more word comes thank you Lord
[59:13] come on Friends there's times you go to
[59:15] work and you don't feel like going to
[59:16] work
[59:18] does that stop you from going to work
[59:19] preach with me now
[59:22] or my feelings what does have feelings
[59:25] listen I thank God for feelings I could
[59:28] go I could go a month or Sundays on this
[59:30] I thank God for feelings I'm glad he
[59:32] gave us feelings but he never gave us
[59:34] feelings as a place to rest and base our
[59:38] life on
[59:40] wow that Sands sometimes that sand feels
[59:44] good but there's other times that sand
[59:46] gets blown all around there's gotta be
[59:49] something deeper
[59:51] than my feelings
[59:55] Hallelujah
[59:59] you could feel tonight like you're saved
[1:00:02] and run around and praising God and the
[1:00:05] next morning you wouldn't have any
[1:00:06] feeling about it at all
[1:00:08] you'd say I'm lost again why feelings
[1:00:12] but when Faith takes hold
[1:00:15] that Jesus Christ This is how Faith
[1:00:18] takes hold that Jesus Christ God's son
[1:00:20] died in your stead and he become you in
[1:00:24] your sins that you in your sins might
[1:00:27] become him in his righteousness and
[1:00:30] accept him as your only perpetuation for
[1:00:33] your sins then Faith takes a hold and
[1:00:36] all Devils out of hell can't move it
[1:00:38] Faith endures Faith locks something it
[1:00:42] seals something that's what faith does
[1:00:45] by faith the elders obtained a good
[1:00:48] report
[1:00:50] they had to walk through adversity they
[1:00:52] had to press through storms they had to
[1:00:55] overcome mind battles they had to fight
[1:00:57] the same facts that you and I have to
[1:00:59] fight oh brother Samuel they don't have
[1:01:01] the pressures like we have today there
[1:01:03] hadn't been one more devil added it's
[1:01:05] the same devil he might come in many
[1:01:07] different forms but I want to remind you
[1:01:10] neither have we added another God he's
[1:01:13] still the almighty God
[1:01:15] [Music]
[1:01:16] he overcame then and he's an overcomer
[1:01:19] now
[1:01:20] [Applause]
[1:01:23] if a man has had Faith now watch this to
[1:01:26] accept Christ he walks up from the altar
[1:01:30] goes outside his associate says you
[1:01:33] haven't got nothing why your eyes are
[1:01:36] still blue that's the same old suit you
[1:01:39] wore in there why your nose is just as
[1:01:41] big as it when you went in your
[1:01:44] fingerprints are just the same there's
[1:01:46] no difference
[1:01:48] well duh God didn't come to try to give
[1:01:51] you a new eye color
[1:01:54] come on Friends
[1:01:57] he didn't come to to change you know
[1:01:59] your suit from a blue into a brown one
[1:02:01] sorry he didn't come to change your big
[1:02:03] nose from through a little nose
[1:02:06] but here's what it is but you know
[1:02:09] but you know there is a difference and
[1:02:12] in the ages to come in the days and
[1:02:15] weeks you'll prove that there's a
[1:02:17] difference because your faith will
[1:02:19] vindicate that you're a Christian notice
[1:02:21] not you your faith will vindicate if
[1:02:25] thou be the Son of God turn these stones
[1:02:28] in the bread your faith will vindicate
[1:02:31] you are a son and daughter of God
[1:02:34] are you hearing me
[1:02:37] Satan wanted Jesus to clown for him
[1:02:41] if thou be if thou be if thou be if thou
[1:02:45] be
[1:02:46] but Jesus knew where he was standing
[1:02:51] he was established
[1:02:54] you say it was established yes he'd just
[1:02:55] come out of the River Jordan
[1:02:57] he was always the word but when he
[1:02:59] walked up out of the River Jordan he was
[1:03:01] the word made flesh because it takes the
[1:03:05] quickening power to come and Quicken the
[1:03:07] word and make the Word Flesh in our
[1:03:09] lives
[1:03:11] are you here man I just don't want to be
[1:03:12] the word we want to be the word made
[1:03:14] flesh to where what is behind the veil
[1:03:17] describes and displays and manifests
[1:03:20] itself and that can only come by the
[1:03:22] quickening power of the Shekinah Glory
[1:03:24] almighty God coming down on the inside
[1:03:27] and he raises the Son and Daughter of
[1:03:30] God to a perfect complete manifestation
[1:03:33] of the glory of God in their life
[1:03:36] here he was standing quickening power
[1:03:39] had already come upon him and here he
[1:03:41] was here he was established established
[1:03:45] just like when God would speak of
[1:03:47] David's Kingdom and then when here it
[1:03:49] was established in Solomon's kingdom
[1:03:51] then it's established you see God gives
[1:03:53] his word now his word is settled is that
[1:03:55] right we looked at that last week's
[1:03:57] Psalms I believe it's 119. his word was
[1:03:59] already established from before the
[1:04:01] foundation of the world God's not coming
[1:04:03] down and changing it's already settled
[1:04:05] but God comes in order to establish that
[1:04:09] word to make it live and that it Finds
[1:04:12] Its Mark in the lives of his children
[1:04:15] the Bible said when David knew his
[1:04:18] kingdom was established when Solomon
[1:04:20] knew his kingdom was see there come a
[1:04:23] time to where they knew God the Bible
[1:04:24] said that the Lord had established him
[1:04:28] and then he could begin to act
[1:04:31] but you know there's a difference he
[1:04:32] says your faith will vindicate that
[1:04:34] you're a Christian how many knows that
[1:04:36] to be a truth every man and woman that's
[1:04:38] ever accepted Christ he says now watch
[1:04:40] our brother Ram will tie this in them
[1:04:42] with Divine Healing he said if you can
[1:04:44] step out and trust your Eternal
[1:04:46] destination upon your faith how much
[1:04:49] more can you step out with that little
[1:04:51] body of yours upon the same atonement
[1:04:53] that he was wounded for our
[1:04:55] transgressions and with his stripes we
[1:04:57] were healed now what's further random
[1:04:59] doing right here he's getting he's
[1:05:01] listen this is God's wisdom at work that
[1:05:05] when a lot of situations and let me say
[1:05:07] this sometimes a lot of a lot of water
[1:05:09] can pass under the bridge in our lives
[1:05:12] and then listen but you never ever when
[1:05:16] you have been born again of the spirit
[1:05:18] of God I'm talking about a real new
[1:05:20] birth that's what I'm preaching on you
[1:05:23] can never get away from that that is not
[1:05:26] something that you can ever hang up and
[1:05:28] oh my I got to put this back on you
[1:05:31] don't put it on it's what God has done
[1:05:34] in your life it's a new creation but
[1:05:37] sometimes we need to be reminded of
[1:05:40] where God brought us from from the
[1:05:42] simplicity D that's right there in our
[1:05:45] life and that's what the Holy Spirit was
[1:05:47] doing right there pointing them back to
[1:05:50] an experience they had because there
[1:05:52] were other needs such as healing in
[1:05:55] their life there might have been other
[1:05:56] needs domestically and everything else
[1:05:59] children so what does it do Point them
[1:06:01] right back to the grounds that they have
[1:06:04] as a Believer to the rights that have
[1:06:06] been given to him and granted by the
[1:06:08] holy ghost that they can stand upon that
[1:06:11] and realize the same God the same Faith
[1:06:14] he inspired me in that moment to walk
[1:06:16] step by step to come completely into
[1:06:19] Christ that it's God's work and the same
[1:06:22] God that did that he's the same God for
[1:06:24] the healing of my body he's the same God
[1:06:26] for my children he's the same God for my
[1:06:29] family he's the same God in every
[1:06:31] situation what is it it's Faith
[1:06:34] mastering circumstances
[1:06:38] Ephesians 3 16.
[1:06:41] here's Paul's prayer
[1:06:43] with the Ephesians
[1:06:46] that he would Grant you
[1:06:48] now Paul is laid out
[1:06:51] what has been committed
[1:06:53] the grace of God is committed unto him
[1:06:55] and then he goes in to see
[1:06:58] and he says that he would Grant you
[1:07:01] according to the riches of his glory to
[1:07:04] be strengthened with might by his spirit
[1:07:09] in the Inner Man notice strengthened
[1:07:13] to be established
[1:07:16] with his power
[1:07:18] by his Spirit where in the Inner Man
[1:07:22] not just in our mind
[1:07:24] not just in our spirit
[1:07:27] down on the inside
[1:07:29] because that's established if it just
[1:07:31] comes upon my spirit that's shifting
[1:07:34] Sands I can who glory to God in it and I
[1:07:36] can hold my but it's shifting Sands in
[1:07:38] just one it'll take a wind and it'll
[1:07:40] blow away
[1:07:42] water can wash it away
[1:07:44] you why are you saying Brother Sam
[1:07:45] you're talking about I'm talking about
[1:07:47] an experience where it's established in
[1:07:51] God
[1:07:54] that Christ May dwell notice how Paul
[1:07:57] would take this that Christ May dwell in
[1:08:00] your hearts by faith that ye being
[1:08:03] rooted and grounded
[1:08:06] in love
[1:08:08] where would he dwell in your hearts
[1:08:11] right he can dwell in a person's mind
[1:08:14] and somebody else will come along and
[1:08:16] talk you out of that
[1:08:17] right we've seen that happen friends
[1:08:20] why is it because it's just there in the
[1:08:22] intellect
[1:08:23] it's an intellectual Faith it's not a
[1:08:26] substance Faith by a Divine experience
[1:08:29] right notice that he might dwell in your
[1:08:32] hearts by faith that you being rooted
[1:08:35] and grounded in Love Now notice this
[1:08:37] with rooted and grounded
[1:08:39] how many how many ever seen plants
[1:08:42] before
[1:08:42] [Music]
[1:08:43] only about three of you four of you
[1:08:46] okay we've seen plants and and trees
[1:08:48] okay
[1:08:49] and this is how Paul Likens this
[1:08:51] dwelling in our hearts by faith that we
[1:08:54] would become rooted
[1:08:56] to cause to strike root to strengthen
[1:08:58] with roots to render firm to fix to
[1:09:02] establish cause a person or thing to be
[1:09:04] thoroughly grounded
[1:09:07] to be grounded in love notice grounded
[1:09:10] in love is to lay the foundation to be
[1:09:13] found make stable established ground or
[1:09:15] settle so it's in his love rooted and
[1:09:20] grounded in love
[1:09:21] you know when you plant a plant you can
[1:09:25] put that plant out put it in the soil
[1:09:27] and my it's a nice plant somebody can
[1:09:29] come right along and take that plant and
[1:09:31] just grab it by the hands if it hasn't
[1:09:34] been rooted right
[1:09:36] they can just grab it up and take it
[1:09:39] away to another location
[1:09:41] because it hasn't been rooted
[1:09:44] and do you realize even when you're
[1:09:46] dealing with even times I'm not going to
[1:09:48] give you a Horticultural lesson but I
[1:09:50] think how the scripture continues to
[1:09:51] talk about a man being planted talk
[1:09:54] about our lives being established do you
[1:09:56] realize that how when we look at many
[1:09:58] times of planting certain types of
[1:10:00] plants Shrubbery bushes and things like
[1:10:02] that that when you look within it you
[1:10:04] have got that you've got to water it but
[1:10:06] not water it by spraying it here on the
[1:10:08] leaves the leaves don't need the water
[1:10:12] but you've got to water it at the base
[1:10:14] but it don't take a a real
[1:10:18] massive flowing powerful water because
[1:10:21] that'll wash all the all the soil away
[1:10:23] that you've just put on the top of it
[1:10:25] but what it takes is it takes a slow
[1:10:29] steady stream of water why because it
[1:10:34] not only soaks that root ball of that
[1:10:36] tree but that water keeps going deeper
[1:10:39] and deeper in the ground you say why do
[1:10:41] you want the water to go deeper in the
[1:10:43] ground when the roots are still up here
[1:10:44] because you're trying to get it rooted
[1:10:47] and you want to teach the roots go deep
[1:10:50] for your source of water
[1:10:54] when I'm not here to water you you've
[1:10:56] got to have a hidden Source in the midst
[1:10:59] of drought in the midst of famine you've
[1:11:02] got to have a source that you're tapped
[1:11:05] into
[1:11:08] and that's why the Holy Spirit goes down
[1:11:10] very purposely in our life let me just
[1:11:13] tell you something it's that way in our
[1:11:15] life that just is not something that one
[1:11:18] time you reach a certain area it keeps
[1:11:20] going deeper and deeper and deeper and
[1:11:23] deeper
[1:11:26] the more that we stay under it
[1:11:32] verse 18.
[1:11:34] and may be able to comprehend notice
[1:11:37] this is part of it be able to comprehend
[1:11:39] with All Saints what is the breath and
[1:11:42] length and depth and height
[1:11:44] how many know it's a realm that the
[1:11:47] person of Jesus Christ is real
[1:11:49] that to be in Christ
[1:11:51] is to be in him
[1:11:53] it's a it's it's a reality it's not just
[1:11:56] a two-dimensional thing it's a reality
[1:11:58] it's a living reality a living God
[1:12:01] that's right here Among Us it's like
[1:12:03] Abraham when God would anoint his eyes
[1:12:06] that he would see Abraham everywhere you
[1:12:09] can see north south east and west I've
[1:12:11] given you this land I've given you all
[1:12:14] these things belong to you
[1:12:16] it's yours
[1:12:18] hold my and to know the love of Christ
[1:12:22] which passeth knowledge
[1:12:26] that you might be filled with all the
[1:12:28] fullness of God
[1:12:31] the passive knowledge can we say Amen
[1:12:34] that's what the no to know to experience
[1:12:37] the love of Christ
[1:12:39] because you can know about the love of
[1:12:41] Christ many many many people are
[1:12:44] thanking him for dying for their sins on
[1:12:46] Calvary but do not see the need of the
[1:12:51] Divine application upon their soul
[1:12:53] they look they looked to what was done
[1:12:56] and say thank you for saving me from
[1:12:58] your from my sins but do you realize to
[1:13:00] save you from your sins it means you are
[1:13:03] no longer dwelling there
[1:13:05] you've been delivered
[1:13:08] but you see listen friends the way that
[1:13:11] the teaching in things is so pervaded
[1:13:14] it's put Christianity as though that the
[1:13:17] work and the life of a Believer is
[1:13:21] something of self-will and
[1:13:23] self-determination
[1:13:25] do believe that we need to have a
[1:13:27] determination but not a determination
[1:13:30] that's relying on our own works I
[1:13:33] believe that we need to have works that
[1:13:35] are inspired by the Holy Ghost and that
[1:13:39] our determination is a determination
[1:13:42] from God's spirit by a Divine unction
[1:13:45] coming upon our life and pulsating in
[1:13:47] our life I do believe that because it is
[1:13:50] a well springing up within you
[1:13:54] right one brother random asks that
[1:13:56] little thing that little stream who what
[1:13:58] makes your bubble is it the deer that
[1:14:00] drink from you is it this is it that
[1:14:03] I'm going to tell you if that's all you
[1:14:06] can do is bubble when people are good to
[1:14:08] you or when they fit your cue or fit
[1:14:10] right in your frame let me tell you
[1:14:12] something you need a deeper experience
[1:14:14] with God
[1:14:16] but at the same you know that's kind of
[1:14:18] that's kind of straight I don't know how
[1:14:19] else to put it friends we're talking
[1:14:21] about being established if the least
[1:14:23] little thing comes up and man it upsets
[1:14:26] your apple cart and you're running here
[1:14:27] and you're running there you need to
[1:14:29] understand somebody else is not your
[1:14:31] problem you need to understand Barry is
[1:14:34] a greater whole that can come in your
[1:14:36] life and establish you as a son and
[1:14:39] daughter of God to where you have
[1:14:41] dominion over your own feelings will I
[1:14:43] feel bad sure there's going to be times
[1:14:45] you feel bad but you've got to have a
[1:14:48] hidden source
[1:14:51] something that passes knowledge
[1:15:00] and be filled with the fullness of God
[1:15:04] notice brother Ram takes us here in the
[1:15:06] five timer Church age and he takes these
[1:15:08] verses of scripture because he's he's
[1:15:09] going to contrast uh when he's talking
[1:15:11] about the the right on the depths of
[1:15:13] Satan and commentators just avoid that
[1:15:15] that whole line of the fatarian age and
[1:15:17] brother bear said it's really really
[1:15:18] simple he said you just have to contrast
[1:15:20] the depths of Satan to the depths of God
[1:15:22] and brother Ram goes into and he says
[1:15:23] when a man he's talking about these
[1:15:25] scriptures here out of the Tyrant age
[1:15:27] when a man experiences the depth of God
[1:15:30] in his life it is an actual personal
[1:15:34] experience of the spirit of God
[1:15:37] indwelling him and his mind is
[1:15:40] illuminated by the wisdom and knowledge
[1:15:43] of God through the word
[1:15:45] now I want you to understand that when
[1:15:47] he experiences the depth of God in his
[1:15:50] life it's an actual personal experience
[1:15:53] indwelling him and his mind becomes
[1:15:56] illuminated by the wisdom and knowledge
[1:15:58] of god notice this experience
[1:16:01] simple definition I know
[1:16:03] but experience it's a practical contact
[1:16:06] with
[1:16:07] an observation of facts or events
[1:16:11] it's an event or occurrence that leaves
[1:16:15] an impression on someone
[1:16:18] that's an experience
[1:16:20] it's a it's a practical observation a
[1:16:24] practical contact with and an
[1:16:27] observation of facts or events an event
[1:16:29] or occurrence that leaves an impression
[1:16:33] on someone
[1:16:36] second Peter chapter 1 verse 10
[1:16:38] wherefore the rather Brethren give
[1:16:40] diligence all carefulness
[1:16:44] to make your calling an election
[1:16:48] sure
[1:16:51] notice they admonition make your calling
[1:16:54] an election sure it's not for the pastor
[1:16:58] it's not for the church it's for in your
[1:17:00] own life and your own walk with God
[1:17:04] to make it sure that you know where
[1:17:06] you're standing
[1:17:08] then you know because there not only
[1:17:10] will be situations that will arise but
[1:17:14] here we are we're at the end
[1:17:17] we're at the time of rapture
[1:17:20] hope so is not good enough you've got to
[1:17:23] be sure be very very sure
[1:17:26] that your Anchor Holds and it grabs on
[1:17:29] the solid rock
[1:17:30] it's a time to be sure and let me tell
[1:17:33] you something you know how powerful it
[1:17:35] is when a person acts sure
[1:17:39] come on we've heard things you know and
[1:17:40] I know everybody has different makeups
[1:17:42] than men that person's awful confident
[1:17:44] in this and that let me tell you
[1:17:45] something I understand we all can have
[1:17:46] our own different makeups about things
[1:17:48] and and whatever more and and there's
[1:17:50] times God God places things out I can't
[1:17:52] even get into that you know God places
[1:17:54] things in certain positions I mean Paul
[1:17:56] couldn't be a pushover and be the
[1:17:58] messenger of the age
[1:18:00] he couldn't be some mealy mouth and
[1:18:02] wandering around and he's the messenger
[1:18:03] of the age it didn't mean he was an
[1:18:05] arrogant big mouth that's not what Paul
[1:18:07] was but Paul was a man that there was a
[1:18:10] confidence that was in him because God
[1:18:12] had revealed himself to Paul that Paul
[1:18:15] could stand in the midst even of Peter
[1:18:17] and call Peter down and said you're
[1:18:19] acting like a hypocrite right here in
[1:18:22] front of the rest of the Gentiles and
[1:18:24] when the Jews are coming down you're
[1:18:26] acting like this you're taking Listerine
[1:18:28] for your bacon breath you're throwing
[1:18:29] away the pork rib bones you're a
[1:18:31] hypocrite
[1:18:33] what was he doing he was calling Peter's
[1:18:36] actions to place because your actions
[1:18:38] are working to try to undo what God
[1:18:41] desires to do among the people
[1:18:44] Hallelujah that's for another day
[1:18:47] but you see the establishment of what
[1:18:50] God would call you and I too that we
[1:18:52] would have a sure walk when you walk
[1:18:54] sure it's just like when Joshua stood
[1:18:57] there before the walls of Jericho he
[1:18:59] drew his sword and he knew right then
[1:19:01] what God had told him not a man shall be
[1:19:03] able to stand before thee all the days
[1:19:05] of thy life that same Surety is when
[1:19:07] they failed at the Battle of Ahad that
[1:19:10] same Surety did not cause Joshua to say
[1:19:13] dear God what have we got ourselves into
[1:19:15] but that same Surety caused him to
[1:19:19] reflect in his own life it caused him to
[1:19:22] reflect in his own walk why there's a
[1:19:25] surety that I've met God this is what he
[1:19:28] said and he cannot fail his words can't
[1:19:31] fail so there ain't nothing wrong with
[1:19:33] God there must be something hindering
[1:19:35] the channel right here
[1:19:38] I tell you that's a mighty conqueror
[1:19:41] that's an overcomer right there you've
[1:19:43] got sheer ground to stand on and be able
[1:19:46] to examine Our Lives
[1:19:48] the Bible said second Timothy 2 19
[1:19:51] nevertheless the foundation of God
[1:19:53] standeth sure having to seal the Lord
[1:19:56] knoweth them that are his and let
[1:19:58] everyone that nameth the name of Christ
[1:20:00] depart from iniquity
[1:20:02] well listen God's a sure God isn't he
[1:20:07] you can you can rest on his word if God
[1:20:09] has said something in his word you can
[1:20:11] rest on it
[1:20:13] if there's something that gets in the
[1:20:14] way that you know any little thought or
[1:20:16] feeling Rises up in in the midst of
[1:20:18] about that a little fear remember that's
[1:20:20] only Satan trying to keep you back if
[1:20:22] there's something that's not right there
[1:20:24] in your life repent of it get it right
[1:20:26] get it under the blood so that you can
[1:20:28] lay a hold on the word that God is
[1:20:30] delivering what is it it's removing all
[1:20:33] obstacles that hinder faith
[1:20:38] God is a sure God
[1:20:41] is that right and he establishes his
[1:20:44] children in a sure work
[1:20:47] now notice brother Ram said this let me
[1:20:48] just let me just bear with me here just
[1:20:50] a little bit Louis Ram is talking about
[1:20:52] when Paul was was converted this out of
[1:20:54] the Hebrew series and brother Brown was
[1:20:56] talking about how that Paul you know
[1:20:58] before he ever you know begin to move
[1:21:00] forward on his experience because he had
[1:21:02] a marvelous experience how many know
[1:21:05] that Paul went away in the deserts of
[1:21:06] Arabia
[1:21:08] Paul just never ran from the light and
[1:21:10] said praise be to God I met the light
[1:21:12] but you see he took the experience he
[1:21:14] had now listen to me don't just skip
[1:21:15] this let this part sink deep
[1:21:18] Paul had an experience but Paul took now
[1:21:22] out into the desert and here he goes out
[1:21:25] and you know what it is the desert
[1:21:27] itself is where that there is no other
[1:21:29] distractions no other opinions we're I'm
[1:21:33] just going to lay myself before God
[1:21:35] because what has happened and what has
[1:21:37] been spoken Paul wanted to see it
[1:21:40] confirmed in the word because Paul
[1:21:42] listen would be an example of the
[1:21:45] Believers that their lives would be
[1:21:47] confirmed in the scripture
[1:21:50] is that right now watch this he says
[1:21:53] when you accept Christ just as your
[1:21:56] personal savior
[1:21:57] it is an experience now listen now I
[1:22:01] believe the joy of knowing your sin is
[1:22:04] Forgiven just Thrills your heart through
[1:22:07] and through so accepting him as a
[1:22:10] personal savior that is an experience
[1:22:13] too
[1:22:14] it Thrills your heart as a matter of
[1:22:16] fact you feel the Lord that you've been
[1:22:18] carrying lift up what is that that's
[1:22:20] forgiveness you've accepted him as your
[1:22:23] personal savior but remember he wants to
[1:22:26] be your lord
[1:22:29] but when this blessed Holy Spirit comes
[1:22:33] down that's an experience that new birth
[1:22:36] that you'll never forget you become a
[1:22:40] child of God and here is what does it I
[1:22:44] like this how do you know it brother
[1:22:46] Branham
[1:22:48] these are teaching lessons he said many
[1:22:51] people the methodists try to say they
[1:22:53] shouted when they got it well that's all
[1:22:56] right if you got it and shout it okay
[1:22:58] because you shouted wasn't a sign you
[1:23:01] had it because a lot shouted and didn't
[1:23:03] have it
[1:23:04] you see this isn't trying to destroy
[1:23:06] people is trying to establish people
[1:23:10] to establish our lives in Christ as Sons
[1:23:14] and Daughters of God the Pentecostal
[1:23:17] said they spoke in tongues they got it
[1:23:19] well that's all right if you speak in
[1:23:22] tongues and got it all right but you
[1:23:24] could speak in tongues and still not
[1:23:25] have it
[1:23:26] so you see after all it is the
[1:23:30] experience of passing from Death to life
[1:23:34] when all the old things die and All
[1:23:37] Things become new Christ becomes real
[1:23:40] now notice the experience of passing
[1:23:44] from Death unto life you take a seed a
[1:23:48] seed is dead but you plant that seed
[1:23:51] water that seed and then eventually
[1:23:54] through the water and the light that
[1:23:56] seed is quickened and begins to come
[1:23:58] forth sometimes before you ever see it
[1:24:02] it has already begin to sprout beneath
[1:24:05] the dirt but if it did it beneath the
[1:24:08] dirt guess what it's going to show above
[1:24:11] the dirt it'll keep on showing it'll
[1:24:13] keep on growing there'll be leaves it'll
[1:24:16] grow taller there'll be more flowers why
[1:24:18] because it's a work where it's no longer
[1:24:21] dead but it's come to life
[1:24:24] and Christ becomes real the old things
[1:24:28] drop away
[1:24:29] the old roots of carnal notice they
[1:24:31] didn't you know it didn't you know
[1:24:33] pulling off the leaves they just drop
[1:24:35] away why because there's no more there's
[1:24:37] no more Life Source to them
[1:24:41] the old roots of carnality you know how
[1:24:43] to dig a root out we used to take a
[1:24:45] grubbing hole and get down at it and dig
[1:24:47] it till there wasn't a speck left in it
[1:24:48] and they said if there be any root of
[1:24:51] bitterness spring up and you grub her
[1:24:52] out and that's what the Holy Spirit does
[1:24:55] root out all the roots
[1:24:59] dig them out pile it up burn them get
[1:25:02] rid of them then you got a good crop
[1:25:04] let me just say this with all from my
[1:25:08] heart if they're still with the things
[1:25:11] that you find in your life that you're
[1:25:13] still the same way
[1:25:16] friends that's not what God means by
[1:25:18] being established
[1:25:20] establish is not where you're in and out
[1:25:23] up and down one moment you're a Believer
[1:25:26] next moment you're not a Believer but to
[1:25:29] be established is where you're anchored
[1:25:31] in him
[1:25:33] and your life has been changed
[1:25:36] amen even your dog knows you've been
[1:25:38] changed your cat knows you've been
[1:25:40] changed your husband knows you've been
[1:25:43] changed your wife knows you've been
[1:25:44] changed everybody else knows you've been
[1:25:46] changed the people on Facebook know
[1:25:48] you've been changed
[1:25:50] [Applause]
[1:25:51] you know why because you're different
[1:25:54] and it's not a put on it's not picking
[1:25:57] off leaves it's new life has come in and
[1:26:00] that new life those leaves are not
[1:26:03] representative of the life that's in you
[1:26:07] it's an established life
[1:26:15] second Corinthians 5 17. I know this is
[1:26:18] very simple but you know what let's see
[1:26:19] I thank God for being this simple
[1:26:22] therefore If any man be in Christ he is
[1:26:24] a new creature old things are passed
[1:26:27] away behold all things are become new
[1:26:32] it didn't say you know everything
[1:26:35] but old things are passed away
[1:26:38] how are they passed away because out of
[1:26:40] here
[1:26:41] the past has come
[1:26:43] it's passed from Death unto life
[1:26:46] it's no longer the same now over and
[1:26:49] over throughout the scripture the
[1:26:50] testimony of the Lord has never been to
[1:26:54] build upon the old
[1:26:56] but upon the new
[1:26:58] right said you can't put new wine
[1:27:01] in all bottles
[1:27:03] it'll blow up
[1:27:05] you can't put a new piece in an old
[1:27:08] quilt it'll stick out like a sore thumb
[1:27:11] right
[1:27:13] so it's everything is building upon the
[1:27:15] new and that's why listen to me the new
[1:27:18] birth is not God cleaning up a man and
[1:27:22] building on the same Foundation it's God
[1:27:25] coming down and not only is he clean the
[1:27:27] person up but God destroys that first
[1:27:30] nature and he raises up that seed on the
[1:27:34] inside by his quickening power and that
[1:27:37] becomes the foundation of the new birth
[1:27:40] that becomes the faith of the Living God
[1:27:43] that grows in the Statue of a perfect
[1:27:45] man
[1:27:46] it's a foundation stone in our life
[1:27:50] so it's not the old man patched up and
[1:27:53] I'm gonna make it better and make it
[1:27:55] better and sometimes my heart and I
[1:27:57] don't sometimes you don't even try to
[1:27:59] get in and try to you know explain
[1:28:00] everything there's times to explain it
[1:28:02] but sometimes you realize when people
[1:28:04] look at things when I'm going to try to
[1:28:06] do better and I'm going to try to come
[1:28:07] to church and I listen I always
[1:28:09] encourage people you know what because
[1:28:11] if you at least come into the house of
[1:28:12] God I got confidence you're in a spot
[1:28:14] where God can deal with your heart but
[1:28:16] it ain't just come into the house of God
[1:28:18] it's it's deeper than I believe you got
[1:28:21] something in you you want to be in the
[1:28:22] house of God
[1:28:24] come on friends I'm preaching the word
[1:28:27] you want to be in the presence of God
[1:28:29] not the presence of a computer screen
[1:28:31] but the presence of God the Bible said
[1:28:34] for sake not to assemble yourselves
[1:28:37] together as the manner of some are right
[1:28:42] that's right I'm quoting now the prophet
[1:28:45] said you got the love of God in your
[1:28:46] heart you can't wait to them Church
[1:28:47] doors are open well I've got all this to
[1:28:50] do I'd be clearing out anything that
[1:28:52] hinders me from getting in the house of
[1:28:54] God
[1:28:56] where my boss needs me Jesus is Calling
[1:28:58] on your soul your family needs you to be
[1:29:01] a real solid a real stable and show them
[1:29:04] what it means to serve God and put God
[1:29:06] first above everything else in this life
[1:29:10] we're talking about truth that
[1:29:13] establishes
[1:29:17] amen Jesus said behold I make all things
[1:29:20] new
[1:29:22] the Rams asked this question
[1:29:25] at the instance of receiving the Holy
[1:29:27] Ghost
[1:29:28] or the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:29:30] is there any difference
[1:29:32] so when someone receives it at that
[1:29:34] instant is there any difference
[1:29:36] does a person speak with tongues if not
[1:29:39] always what manifestation is known
[1:29:43] brother Brian said well could you
[1:29:45] imagine a mother giving birth to a baby
[1:29:46] and not knowing it
[1:29:49] I love the simplicity
[1:29:51] she'd have to be conscious not to know
[1:29:54] it neither can you receive the Holy
[1:29:56] Ghost without knowing it now just watch
[1:29:59] now follow me now because if you stop on
[1:30:01] that statement
[1:30:03] you could be thinking about some sort of
[1:30:05] a sensation or an emotion
[1:30:09] I I believe in Sensations I believe in
[1:30:11] emotions but I don't believe that
[1:30:12] Sensations or emotions are the evidence
[1:30:15] because you can have a lot of sensation
[1:30:17] let me tell you something I had a
[1:30:18] sensation around the fire last night I
[1:30:19] got hot I got away from I had another
[1:30:21] sensation I got cold
[1:30:25] I got my emotions sometimes fluctuate
[1:30:27] sometimes I get angry and then other
[1:30:29] times I'm satisfied my emotions can go
[1:30:33] back and forth so I'm not resting upon a
[1:30:35] sensation listen I'm not against
[1:30:37] sensation I'm not against emotion but
[1:30:41] this is where it comes down to brother
[1:30:43] Brown says neither can you receive the
[1:30:45] Holy Ghost without knowing it so what is
[1:30:48] then am I looking for
[1:30:51] there's something takes place
[1:30:54] in you
[1:30:56] there's something that changes you
[1:30:59] your whole system your whole spiritual
[1:31:02] system is made new again you become a
[1:31:06] new creature in Christ as the Bible puts
[1:31:08] in a New Creation in Christ and you know
[1:31:10] it what is it the old things are passed
[1:31:13] away
[1:31:15] how to get you to look at something
[1:31:16] wrong try to put them pants on again try
[1:31:19] to put that makeup on again come on
[1:31:21] Friends try to do those things again
[1:31:23] what is it the appetite is gone
[1:31:27] because the things of the world has fled
[1:31:29] away what did that it's a work of the
[1:31:32] Holy Ghost in your life
[1:31:34] whether you had emotion or sensation
[1:31:36] it's a creative word by the creative
[1:31:39] power of almighty God that comes on the
[1:31:42] inside and transforms that life
[1:31:47] you know you know because why your whole
[1:31:50] system has changed
[1:31:52] anybody ever had anything changed where
[1:31:54] your appetite change for certain things
[1:31:59] somebody just said my appetite's just in
[1:32:02] gear right now buddy
[1:32:05] I've had certain things change
[1:32:09] certain things and right now that you
[1:32:11] know that I don't like no more
[1:32:13] then there's certain things that I just
[1:32:15] didn't used to like that I like
[1:32:19] I know it's a very simple natural carnal
[1:32:21] example but that's just as simple as
[1:32:24] when the New Birth has come
[1:32:26] there's things it ain't nobody had to
[1:32:28] tell you there's certain things that you
[1:32:31] don't want to do no more
[1:32:33] there's things I don't got to desire for
[1:32:35] no more
[1:32:37] it ain't no I hope I don't do it no more
[1:32:39] there ain't no desire no more
[1:32:41] because they can they get their own mind
[1:32:43] they could stack your closet full of
[1:32:46] them they could blast your computer with
[1:32:48] it but there's something on the inside
[1:32:50] that's greater than every Temptation
[1:32:53] what is that it's the solid rock and the
[1:32:56] whole of the establishing power of
[1:32:59] almighty God it's not on the outside not
[1:33:02] the things that inner man that defile
[1:33:04] him
[1:33:06] it's what comes from the inside
[1:33:09] that's why brother random says when you
[1:33:11] say I've got the Holy Ghost he said and
[1:33:14] there's still things in your life coming
[1:33:15] out against it makeup he says
[1:33:19] things you know your mouth and other
[1:33:21] things are coming out brother brain goes
[1:33:22] through a whole list and you must be
[1:33:23] born again when things are coming out
[1:33:25] that aren't right that's a signification
[1:33:28] it's not been established yet
[1:33:33] oh my
[1:33:35] there's got to be a settled assurance
[1:33:38] by the word of the Lord
[1:33:41] brother Brian just says it like this
[1:33:43] he quotes the scripture
[1:33:46] out of Hebrews 10 1. I'm coming down
[1:33:48] here
[1:33:49] for the law having a shadow of good
[1:33:51] things to come and not the very image of
[1:33:53] the things can never with those
[1:33:55] sacrifices which they offered year by
[1:33:56] year continually make the comers they're
[1:33:59] into perfect
[1:34:00] they offered them right and they had to
[1:34:04] offer them but once the perfect
[1:34:05] sacrifice came
[1:34:08] those sacrifices could never deal with
[1:34:11] the root cause
[1:34:14] there had to come the perfect sacrifice
[1:34:16] that all of them were pointing to
[1:34:19] for when for would they not have ceased
[1:34:22] to be offered if they made us perfect
[1:34:23] would they not have ceased to be offered
[1:34:25] because that the worshipers once purged
[1:34:27] should have had no more conscience
[1:34:30] desire of sins
[1:34:33] so the Perfection is where it removes
[1:34:36] the very desire
[1:34:38] every the desire has changed
[1:34:41] Christ is dwelling in the heart
[1:34:44] everything's about him
[1:34:46] your whole life is revolving around him
[1:34:49] decisions you make about him
[1:34:53] see that's why when there's things that
[1:34:54] God works in your life and our lives
[1:34:57] would grow and maturing you begin to see
[1:35:00] things more and more in a way
[1:35:03] that you realize being more and more of
[1:35:06] the importance
[1:35:07] of putting spiritual things first
[1:35:11] it's normally an appetite but there's
[1:35:13] things that you begin to see the effects
[1:35:15] of that
[1:35:16] brother Bram says this in Satan's Eve
[1:35:18] now I want you just to think of this for
[1:35:19] a moment
[1:35:21] brother Bradley's talking about that
[1:35:23] Tripper once Purge has no more
[1:35:24] conscience of Sin Sin
[1:35:27] has passed from him
[1:35:29] and this quote I referred this quote to
[1:35:31] you many times and this is always a
[1:35:33] quote that just I don't know how anyone
[1:35:35] could say that brother Bram didn't
[1:35:37] preach on the Holy Ghost but I
[1:35:38] understand what they're saying here let
[1:35:40] me read this he said I heard brother
[1:35:42] Neville say this morning someone might
[1:35:44] have been asking him why I didn't preach
[1:35:46] on the Holy Ghost and why I didn't do
[1:35:47] this here it is you have to remember
[1:35:49] this is 1965.
[1:35:52] people are caught here they are it's in
[1:35:54] a junction
[1:35:55] so you have individuals that are sitting
[1:35:57] in the Tabernacle remember the
[1:35:58] Tabernacle that a lot of you have people
[1:36:00] that was there that was Baptist
[1:36:02] right then you had people that come in
[1:36:04] with Pentecostal then you had people
[1:36:06] that come in who were methodists
[1:36:08] so you had you had such a part which was
[1:36:10] really representative of how God would
[1:36:12] be assembling his bride to himself
[1:36:15] but we would not hang on to our identity
[1:36:18] of Baptist Pentecostal methodists and
[1:36:21] Lutheran but we take the identity of
[1:36:24] Christ
[1:36:25] because we want we recognize his name is
[1:36:28] above every other name
[1:36:30] right because so when we see this
[1:36:34] brother Ram is dealing with this part to
[1:36:36] really to establish even the people
[1:36:38] there he says the Holy Ghost is the
[1:36:41] action
[1:36:42] in you
[1:36:44] it's a life not an emotion not some sort
[1:36:48] of a fleshly evidence
[1:36:51] but it is a person Jesus Christ the word
[1:36:55] of God
[1:36:56] established in your heart to Quicken
[1:37:00] every word of this age
[1:37:04] notice he's established in your heart
[1:37:06] and the word just keeps on becoming
[1:37:08] alive he's quickening every word he's
[1:37:11] quickening you're quick into the word
[1:37:12] it's a living reality you you're seeing
[1:37:15] the breath type depth you're you're
[1:37:16] walking in the love of God and it's it's
[1:37:18] a quickening he's established
[1:37:21] in your heart
[1:37:24] but the man says watch the Holy Ghost in
[1:37:27] action
[1:37:28] not so much in demonstrations
[1:37:31] but in action what it does according
[1:37:36] to the word
[1:37:39] that's real establishment
[1:37:42] it's an action that comes forth
[1:37:45] from within
[1:37:48] not many many demonstrations that can be
[1:37:51] done we believe in demonstrations the
[1:37:53] Bible said that the god that the the
[1:37:56] gospel came not in word only but in
[1:37:58] power and demonstration is that right
[1:38:01] it's the power of God coming down and
[1:38:03] working dealing with hearts brother
[1:38:06] Brandon put it as simply as like this
[1:38:07] where the sword of the Lord comes down
[1:38:10] and it cuts away unbelief from lives it
[1:38:13] cuts away diseases it cuts away Devils
[1:38:17] because do you realize a person might be
[1:38:19] Desiring to be saved
[1:38:22] but there's a spirit of unbelief that's
[1:38:24] got to be Cast Away
[1:38:26] they can desire certain things but
[1:38:28] that's why the preaching of the Gospel
[1:38:29] the sword of the Lord comes
[1:38:33] the spirits of unbelief it casts them
[1:38:36] away so that is the children of God we
[1:38:39] can rise right up into the promises of
[1:38:41] God maybe it's a spirit of Gloom a
[1:38:43] spirit of Despair Spirit of depression
[1:38:45] anxiety whatever it might be the word of
[1:38:49] God comes to deal with that so that you
[1:38:52] might be able to take a hold on the
[1:38:54] promise of almighty God
[1:38:58] it comes to establish us
[1:39:01] let me just stop there
[1:39:03] much more than I have here in front of
[1:39:04] me but
[1:39:05] we just stopped there
[1:39:08] becomes the word of God comes
[1:39:11] to establish us and to lead us and guide
[1:39:13] us into all truth
[1:39:16] when he has come
[1:39:18] he will lead and guide us into all truth
[1:39:22] it's an experience
[1:39:24] that establishes us
[1:39:27] you see
[1:39:29] if it's just if it's just taking
[1:39:32] knowledge of the message doctrines
[1:39:37] without an experience
[1:39:39] that house is headed for a great fall
[1:39:44] and I don't want you just to think about
[1:39:45] your own self but think about your
[1:39:48] family too
[1:39:50] think about others that are around you
[1:39:52] your children whether they're here
[1:39:53] whether they're grown
[1:39:55] it's important
[1:39:57] that in your life my life in our walk
[1:40:00] that not only are we established but we
[1:40:03] are continually being established
[1:40:06] in the word of God
[1:40:09] growing deeper not in our own reasonings
[1:40:13] but in the word of God
[1:40:16] amen God establishing us rooting us Paul
[1:40:19] would go on to say in another place
[1:40:21] rooting us establishing us strengthening
[1:40:25] us in our walk with God
[1:40:28] to be stronger today
[1:40:31] than we were before
[1:40:33] if God tarries to be stronger the next
[1:40:36] day
[1:40:37] to be stronger than next week by what
[1:40:40] by him
[1:40:42] as he comes to establish us to
[1:40:45] strengthen us and I look at this this
[1:40:47] right here when we begin looking at this
[1:40:49] last week
[1:40:52] because we you see such a thing with the
[1:40:54] with the unsettledness
[1:40:57] you see such things with unsettlements
[1:41:00] I believe it's a Time
[1:41:02] to be very settled
[1:41:04] I believe it's a Time To Know Who You
[1:41:07] Are
[1:41:09] who your father is and where you belong
[1:41:13] right I believe it's a time to be
[1:41:15] settled that we know in whom we have
[1:41:17] believed and our feet are on Solid
[1:41:20] Ground because when we are standing
[1:41:23] right there and we look it it does US
[1:41:25] good to look to see where our feet are
[1:41:27] standing because if you're not there
[1:41:29] this morning you'll want to get there
[1:41:32] you want to let the spirit of God come
[1:41:34] down and operate on your faith
[1:41:38] to where it becomes a faith that's set
[1:41:41] it's locked it's unmovable why because
[1:41:45] it's God's faith operating in your heart
[1:41:50] your feelings remember what I opened
[1:41:52] that with
[1:41:55] your feelings at times my feelings at
[1:41:57] times there's times that you don't feel
[1:42:00] like a good Christian
[1:42:02] you don't feel
[1:42:05] but it's not your feelings that's why I
[1:42:07] said there's got to be something deeper
[1:42:09] because the new birth is not something
[1:42:12] you can ever get away from
[1:42:14] it it ain't something that you say well
[1:42:16] you know I just I just ran out in the
[1:42:18] world and I'd say I was like this and
[1:42:20] all of a sudden I came back thank God
[1:42:22] that the new birth and the new birth
[1:42:23] don't do that
[1:42:24] sorry the new birth don't do that it is
[1:42:27] an anchor of the Soul you might have had
[1:42:31] a knowledge that you couldn't get away
[1:42:32] of the knowledge of the truth but the
[1:42:36] knowledge of the truth and the person of
[1:42:39] the truth
[1:42:40] is different
[1:42:42] it's to have an experience to know the
[1:42:46] love of God
[1:42:47] because people can have a knowledge of
[1:42:49] the truth
[1:42:51] and they can go every which way they can
[1:42:53] go on dance floors they can go
[1:42:54] everywhere out there and they've got a
[1:42:56] knowledge of it
[1:42:57] but if you got the personal truth on the
[1:42:59] inside you'll never want to go back out
[1:43:01] to a dance floor
[1:43:03] brother Samuel that's putting it off
[1:43:05] astray that's Solid Ground
[1:43:07] that's a place that you can put your
[1:43:10] faith on and you know in your heart
[1:43:12] there ain't nothing about a dance floor
[1:43:14] in my life there is nothing there
[1:43:16] there's no desire for it so you know
[1:43:18] what there's no fear of the world
[1:43:20] perfect love casts out all fear
[1:43:27] I'm not afraid of going back there's
[1:43:30] nothing to go back to how can you say
[1:43:32] that there's nothing in here that wants
[1:43:35] to go back
[1:43:37] I'm not connected with the world
[1:43:40] if you love the world or the things of
[1:43:43] the world the love of the father is not
[1:43:45] even in you
[1:43:47] that's why it's to be very sure and
[1:43:49] brother Brennan brings it right down in
[1:43:50] greatest about her thought he said if
[1:43:52] you're doing the right things only
[1:43:53] because it's right and you still have a
[1:43:55] desire for the wrong you're still not
[1:43:57] right
[1:44:00] that's why keeping the law ain't enough
[1:44:03] it's got to be something deeper than
[1:44:05] just what I know is right it's got to be
[1:44:07] a confession from the heart that Jesus
[1:44:10] Christ indeed is risen that he is savior
[1:44:14] he's Redeemer he's Lord and he's
[1:44:17] enthroned in my life
[1:44:19] [Applause]
[1:44:20] [Music]
[1:44:23] sure established
[1:44:25] because as we're established we grow
[1:44:29] and the spirit of God moving
[1:44:32] in our hearts and our lives
[1:44:34] and we're not the same
[1:44:36] we're not the same I can look back even
[1:44:38] years ago I can look back even a year
[1:44:39] ago I can look back on things I'm not
[1:44:41] saying this to brag because this I'm
[1:44:43] kind of ahead on things and layers of
[1:44:46] this but I will say this to you the Holy
[1:44:49] Spirit does not leave us
[1:44:51] as babies
[1:45:00] he don't leave us as babies
[1:45:03] but he wants us to grow up into him
[1:45:07] in all
[1:45:08] things
[1:45:12] what's he doing further establishing us
[1:45:15] what's he doing bringing Sons and
[1:45:17] Daughters of God into adoption
[1:45:19] into Authority
[1:45:22] confidence that's moving in our lives
[1:45:25] it's not that we don't have that
[1:45:27] Authority now as Sons and Daughters of
[1:45:28] God we do but you see it's all released
[1:45:31] not just wide open it's all based on
[1:45:35] character
[1:45:37] power without character
[1:45:41] so in order for increased power and
[1:45:44] authority it's increased character
[1:45:47] increased character increase suffering
[1:45:50] what does increased suffering mean it
[1:45:53] means from lives that are giving
[1:45:54] themselves more to God because many are
[1:45:57] the afflictions of the righteous
[1:46:00] and the Lord delivereth him out of them
[1:46:03] all
[1:46:04] right are you hearing me
[1:46:06] that's why sometimes as we said before
[1:46:08] we say tests and trials if your life is
[1:46:10] not walking on with God then I would not
[1:46:12] be calling it a test or trial it'd be
[1:46:14] looking at it as chastening from God to
[1:46:17] begin to examine our lives and say where
[1:46:19] am I at with God
[1:46:22] why so I can be clear I can be straight
[1:46:26] you love him
[1:46:28] established oh I know it may not have
[1:46:30] been a shouting and you know off the off
[1:46:32] the roof and everything I realize that
[1:46:34] and I'm okay with that because it's
[1:46:35] pastor
[1:46:37] I'm okay with that but I do know this
[1:46:39] right here my heart's desires for every
[1:46:41] life and for every heart to be
[1:46:43] established and continue to be
[1:46:45] established
[1:46:46] in him that our lives grow as
[1:46:49] individuals that Christ is enthroned in
[1:46:51] our hearts and I'd say to you this
[1:46:52] morning if your faith is not come to
[1:46:55] that place yet let God come down and
[1:46:57] operate on your faith be honest with him
[1:47:00] be honest with first of all if you can't
[1:47:02] be honest with yourself you'll never be
[1:47:03] honest with God
[1:47:05] but you've got to be honest with
[1:47:06] yourself there that I'm not there yet
[1:47:09] and maybe in your heart you're not even
[1:47:11] there yet in your heart but at least to
[1:47:13] be honest and say God
[1:47:15] get my heart to that place Lord help me
[1:47:18] Lord let my heart come into that place
[1:47:20] to where Lord it begins to really it's
[1:47:23] not just what's wrong but My Heart Lord
[1:47:25] God to be right to be longing after you
[1:47:28] Lord to come to that place to be broken
[1:47:30] Lord to where you can move
[1:47:33] amen and that's establishing in our
[1:47:35] hearts how the Holy Spirit moving old
[1:47:38] things are passed away
[1:47:39] I think it seem how he rooting things
[1:47:41] out in our life there's things that God
[1:47:44] Roots out in our life and he takes out
[1:47:46] in our life and things how the holy
[1:47:48] spirit continues to move and change us
[1:47:50] from Glory unto Glory
[1:47:54] he's doing that
[1:47:56] it's a continual work of the Holy Spirit
[1:48:00] moving in our life
[1:48:03] transforming US changing us from Glory
[1:48:06] unto Glory let's pray
[1:48:09] Heavenly Father
[1:48:14] Lord Jesus
[1:48:19] Lord how we we thank you
[1:48:21] God for them
[1:48:24] the simplicity
[1:48:27] Lord of your word
[1:48:30] Lord I pray his way
[1:48:32] think about Lord through
[1:48:34] this moment this service
[1:48:37] they just asked that God that
[1:48:39] if there's one Lord that's here
[1:48:43] the Lord has never
[1:48:45] come to that place of a real settledness
[1:48:49] in their heart Lord they've met you
[1:48:53] that Lord like you laid it out so clear
[1:48:55] here in the message
[1:48:59] but lord it's an experience that is
[1:49:01] known on the inside where the whole
[1:49:04] spiritual where the whole system changes
[1:49:07] on the inside
[1:49:09] owned leaves drop off not us plucking
[1:49:12] them off Lord
[1:49:14] father I pray God here this morning Lord
[1:49:17] would you just would you grant that Lord
[1:49:19] in a special way would you grant the
[1:49:21] courage
[1:49:23] in the hearts Lord of your children
[1:49:25] Lord if there's one that is not Lord
[1:49:30] experience that Lord father it doesn't
[1:49:32] matter Lord God of how old they are it
[1:49:35] doesn't matter how long that they've
[1:49:37] even been coming Lord you don't give
[1:49:39] your word to pick pick on us Lord you
[1:49:43] give your word Lord you speak to us that
[1:49:45] we might be established and that we
[1:49:48] might grow
[1:49:49] and Lord throughout this this life and
[1:49:52] this journey and realize Lord that today
[1:49:55] very much this morning we dealt very
[1:49:58] much Lord upon the beginnings
[1:50:00] but God
[1:50:02] we all want to continue to grow Lord
[1:50:06] to continue to be established Lord in
[1:50:10] you
[1:50:11] in your working
[1:50:12] in your leading Lord
[1:50:14] granted Lord I pray
[1:50:17] in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:50:21] amen
[1:50:23] amen and amen
[1:50:26] I can't think of any other
[1:50:28] any other Joy just sing whatever's on
[1:50:31] your heart I can't think of any other
[1:50:33] Joy or any greater Delight
[1:50:36] and see Christ established in our hearts
[1:50:39] and our lives
[1:50:42] you say why is that brother Sammy well
[1:50:44] I'll tell you why because I know there's
[1:50:45] a lot of adversities I know there's a
[1:50:47] lot of tests I know there's a lot of
[1:50:48] trial but it ain't just about tests and
[1:50:49] trials and adversity you're not you you
[1:50:51] we don't we don't serve God just so we
[1:50:53] can make it through adversity
[1:50:56] adversity comes
[1:50:58] if all we saw was adversity if we saw
[1:51:01] some of the tests that we had to go
[1:51:02] through at first
[1:51:04] if we've solved some if God let us know
[1:51:06] some of the things that we've passed
[1:51:07] through
[1:51:08] I'm sure we would have looked and we
[1:51:10] would have fainted
[1:51:13] yeah
[1:51:16] sure see that's why sometimes when
[1:51:18] sometimes a person looks at they look at
[1:51:20] serving the lord but they look at it in
[1:51:22] terms of I got to give this up and I got
[1:51:24] to give that up and I got you're looking
[1:51:26] at the wrong thing
[1:51:29] if you can ever get a real clear
[1:51:32] glimpse of calvary
[1:51:34] if you can ever get a real clear glimpse
[1:51:36] of him if that that person can just get
[1:51:38] a glimpse of him
[1:51:40] then everything else
[1:51:42] God will take care of everything else in
[1:51:45] your life
[1:51:45] as a love of God begins to work it's
[1:51:48] about a personal relationship
[1:51:51] with Jesus Christ
[1:51:53] it establishes in your heart
[1:51:56] establishes in our life and sure
[1:51:58] adversities will come sure tests and
[1:52:01] trials are disappointments will come
[1:52:03] offenses will come
[1:52:05] oh my
[1:52:08] but there's something there's an anchor
[1:52:10] that holds
[1:52:13] in the midst of it all
[1:52:16] stabilizes us
[1:52:18] it's a victory in our life
[1:52:22] brother Brown would say it like this in
[1:52:23] Jubilee year he says you can find that
[1:52:26] person he says they got victory
[1:52:28] he said on this day of the week Victory
[1:52:31] on that day of the week he said they got
[1:52:32] Victory when they're out of a trial and
[1:52:34] they got Victory when they're in a trial
[1:52:35] he said what is that he said that's not
[1:52:37] your spirit
[1:52:38] he said that's the Holy Spirit
[1:52:40] [Music]
[1:52:42] it's something he does within us
[1:52:45] I look at them I think God if I did I
[1:52:47] mean if I didn't have that that's what
[1:52:49] I'd want more than anything else I'd
[1:52:50] want that establishment in my heart I'd
[1:52:53] want to know in whom I have believed
[1:52:55] because it affects your relationships it
[1:52:58] affects everything else around you when
[1:53:00] you know where you're standing
[1:53:04] it affects everything because then you
[1:53:06] know what happens just just not even
[1:53:07] about what you say but just the
[1:53:10] atmosphere that then is around you
[1:53:13] it's changed
[1:53:15] it's a Son of God a daughter of God
[1:53:18] registers and atmosphere
[1:53:21] about your life it's the atmosphere of
[1:53:24] the Holy Spirit
[1:53:25] [Music]
[1:53:26] let me just say this to you
[1:53:29] even in your own life
[1:53:31] I believe God has spoke so deeply of
[1:53:34] what to look at even today maybe some of
[1:53:37] you struggled you've looked at things
[1:53:38] you've looked in your life and you're
[1:53:40] well how could I make this mistakes or
[1:53:41] how could I and listen friends I'm not
[1:53:43] talking about willful sin I'm talking
[1:53:44] about when you look down in your life
[1:53:47] to be able to see
[1:53:49] that your whole system has been changed
[1:53:51] the desires have been changed
[1:53:54] the things that once held you in bondage
[1:53:57] no longer hold you in bondage any longer
[1:54:00] things that once ruled you I'm not going
[1:54:02] to do this or I'm not going to look at
[1:54:03] that I'm not going to do this I'm not
[1:54:04] going to do that I'm not going to wear
[1:54:05] this I'm not going to do this I'm not
[1:54:07] going to say this I'm not going to oh I
[1:54:08] can't do that
[1:54:09] and you realize
[1:54:12] you don't have to be controlled
[1:54:15] no more
[1:54:16] [Music]
[1:54:19] God never made you to be the tale
[1:54:23] you're to be the head
[1:54:26] that's what he makes you to be
[1:54:29] and he works to establish you and to
[1:54:32] build you maybe there's areas in your
[1:54:33] life right here this morning you say God
[1:54:35] I need some building
[1:54:37] I need some establishing I need some
[1:54:39] further strengthening things that God
[1:54:41] deals with very very very personally
[1:54:43] why don't you just invite him walk the
[1:54:46] anointing
[1:54:47] of the holy spirit is here his word has
[1:54:49] went forth It's a time to reach into
[1:54:51] Grand take a hold of that word let the
[1:54:55] word take a hold of your life
[1:54:57] let it change you
