yes Lord precious price of love until Hallelujah amen aren't you thankful for that it's certainly good to be in the house of the Lord this morning meant good to be with each of you amen God has just blessed us with another opportunity to come together a man and to worship him and to hear from him this morning and just to invite him to move in a special way Amen in each of our lives and I believe that's what we've gathered here I just want to say as well just kind of on the tales of other things it's been mentioned Happy Father's Day to all the fathers amen that are out there and if you have your your father still here with you it'd be a good thing to really let him know amen and to give him a good hug I wish I could give my dad a hug yeah you know on a days like this and on times of course it's not just days like this there's many things right now that I come through many different times which dad was here right now I'd like to ask him about this I'd like to uh you know it's something about it you know with our our fathers when they've passed through certain Journeys and experiences in their lives and uh you know and that's something that's just so precious and we just God bless you each and every one because we certainly thank God for his grace in that also uh brother uh I don't even think that he's here this morning but uh so I have to maybe wait and do that on another time but I think is Matthew Bosley here this morning not here this morning well anyhow we'll have to make sure that that's done even next week or I'll get it when I get back but uh certainly brother Matthew he has graduated there from high school and we certainly appreciate that so we just God bless you thank you musicians I want to as we prepare to turn on the word of the Lord I just ask you to remember remember me in prayer this coming week fly to or I'll be flying to Australia for a youth a youth meeting and it'll be from pretty much when I hit the ground till when I leave and come back so only be gone just about a week actually a little bit more than that but they're a day ahead of time so we'll try to get in from that and uh then I just asked for your prayers because we have that and then I'm here for a week and then I've got a few services in the midweek I've got the byc in the morning so I certainly covet your prayers not just in strength in my body but God will just move in a special way I tell you I know a lot of people may want I've had other brothers say oh my you know if going to Australia and I said it I said look if you feel it on your heart I'll stand behind you because to me I don't like traveling things might be very beautiful but I'm I'm a guy that you know I like being I like being home and it's not just being home it's just there's there's things that you know uh within it I that's so there's a lot of times with the trip and you know I'm not interested in a trip I'd rather much more do other things than just setting for 20 some hours so uh I just covet your prayers and we want to see God move God knows what he's doing you know and sometimes the way the way that God chooses things I I don't even try I don't try to figure it out I don't try to explain it how God and why God would take a vessel from one place in the world and bring them here I don't even understand it from across the state God take one vessel bring another vessel and hear through that vessel God speaks something and it just quickens something in a life why is that that's God's Sovereign working it had nothing to do with the vessel it's all God and so we just I covet your prayers and asked that God just really pour out his spirit amen among the young people that are there and so brother Ronnie long will be here on Thursday and then brother Nathan Erickson will be here on Sunday and so I I know that you will be will be blessed and so we just want to look to the Lord amen uh let's go here to Second Peter chapter 1 verse 12. and I want to read just that one verse of scripture again that we began looking at last week Peter here writing under inspiration he says wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though you know them and be established in the present truth I want you just to think of this there's though you know these things and there's certain things that Peter is speaking of then you see it in the preceding scriptures which I'm not going to touch on this morning and be established in the present truth that's very very important is to be established not in the past but be established in the present truth the scripture said walk in the lightest he's in the light then the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all unrighteousness so we know that God is light is that right and so the light is God Illuminating God by his life Illuminating and that also is the revealing of the blood that's his Spirit coming among his children and so we to be established in the present truth and I can't think there'd be no greater desire in our hearts than to be established in present truth and that word established I read this to you last week but if you permit me just to read it once again the word established it means to establish or establish or be steadfastly set it's to make stable place firmly or set Fast Fix to set one's face steadfastly to keep the faiths turned and to strengthen make firm to render constant confirm in one's mind now there's many different uh ways within this same word as you see me reading here that can take it in the scripture but if we can say it like this there's a Resolute within the heart of a person it's where you've you're stable there's you know wins can come but down beneath you're stable situations can arise but there is a stability that's in your life and the face being steadfastly set and I referenced this the last time is like when the Lord Jesus was going he was going in the Fulfillment of the word of God and he had his face set to Jerusalem he was ready there was nothing that was going to deter him I believe that that's where the holy spirit continues to move in our lives as we walk on with the Lord is we it's not just something that just happens but we have to give ourselves to it and seeing the hour we're in seeing the the need and even in our lives and seeing within everything is where Satan would love to get our sights distracted on other things you may remember even Peter said oh not so Lord they're not going to do this to you and the Lord Jesus looked around and said get thee behind me Satan for thou art and offense unto me what was what was Satan trying to do was trying to get him to turn aside from the purpose that he was here upon Earth for amen but we thank God for his grace Amen to be established Amen in him let's just let's just go to him in a word of prayer this morning Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for these moments that you allow us to have and be gathered in your presence we pray that God that you'll just take control Lord in this in this service Lord may you just Lord anoint these lips of clay anoint our ears and our hearts Lord may you move Among Us in a very special way this morning Lord you're the one who knows the needs Lord of your children Lord there's things the Lord that you place Lord on my heart and things that come upon my heart but Lord you know Lord how everything is to be placed you know what needs to be said and Lord most of all Lord God that you just move Lord right up next to every heart and every life Lord and just make yourself Lord more real lord to each of our lives and may we walk out of this building Lord this morning Lord should you tarry Lord established and more established oh God in you father Lord we just give ourselves to you now Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you as you're being seated amen I I want to just look at this this word and this this thought um just something that just resonating on my heart since somewhat in the first parts of May and just looking at it not knowing if we were going to speak on these things or not but just seeing even the need within this hour I believe that it's the objective of the Gospel is the is that there would be the establishment of the believer in Christ that's that's the goal is that we would be established in Christ and we would continue to be strengthened and continue to mature and grow in him it's something beware that in our lives you know from day to day sometimes and month to month we maybe don't see changes in our life but you just look over a little period of time and you can see how things change within your life over pictures and things like that and sometimes those aren't Pleasant places maybe to be able to visit because you realize oh my things are changing you know but when we recognize that within in it all that there's things that in our lives I trust that we're able to look back across our life and say I'm not the same person that I was before that God is moving God is working and I'm I'm I'm there's not only a different person but I'm I'm further up the road by his grace and things that where he's brought me through and that's always a comfort and encouragement because it shows you God's working in spite of what your thoughts are about things and that's what's very important and so God's desire is to bring us into that rightful position of every every son and daughter of God and I want to go to a scripture here in Luke chapter 6 and verse 46 a common scripture reading we can find it even in the Book of Matthew but I want to bring it with the wording that is wrote here in verse 46 of Luke of Luke chapter six why call ye me Lord Lord and do not the things which I say whosoever cometh to me and heareth my sayings and do with them I will show you to whom he is like now notice coming to him hearing him and doing what he's saying now he's going to show us this what this man is like he's like a man which built a house and dig deep and laid the foundation on a rock and when the flood arose the stream beat vehemently upon that house and could not shake it for it was founded upon a rock but he that heareth and doeth not now here we have a contrast want both are hearing but now the second part is not doing what is being heard is like a man that without a foundation built and house upon the Earth against which the stream did beat vehemently and immediately it fell and the ruin of that house was great and I when we take of this scripture can we think of this here I you know my my my heart and my mind goes into that example that brother Brandon would talk about of that bridge that was built there in Sydney Australia where that there was a need to connect those two portions of land but they needed somebody to build a bridge that could that could span that and not just something that would go from one point to another but something that would actually hold something that would be solid something that would be able to handle the traffic and when I began to look at all of that brother Bram goes into it but I begin to look at it on my own and you find that when the man built this bridge matter of fact he built multiple bridges in Australia this man himself it was there would be four lanes of traffic on it and two lanes and two parts of it for rails one rail coming one rail going one rail coming talking about railroad cars and and a path for people to walk on and with bikes so we're talking a very massive wide bridge and the loads that would have to be on it and remember they there there was a need to build this bridge and brother Brahm kind of goes into the background of it and you can read about this that you know in order to actually build the bridge they had a choice they could either take a cheap route somebody that would just build it cheaply or they could take a route that it's going to cost them quite a bit and but when they chose that route it was going to cost them with this particular engineer but that man went down there and he blew off all the sand he because he had built upon sand just shifts you you know how it is when you could build a sand castle or you can build something in the sand in the beach out there in Lake on Lakeview Beach and you let the water come in pretty soon it'll wash everything away yeah it's only something that you could point out and say well I I know at one time I built a sandcastle so there but there's no evidence that remains that anything was there or you can take a wind that can come along and you know you heard of sandstorms it could just blow it anyway because sand was never meant to be a source of building anything on let me just tell you there's a part of you and I that is sand and that part within you and I as Mortals is that of that of our reasoning of our spirit realm because reasoning can shift and reasoning yet within the Mind itself remember brother Ram tells us the biggest part of our faith is intellectual faith and he would tell us this is how it works his faith Express he would tell us don't throw that intellectual Faith away he said for if you just would take a hold of that and continue to nurse upon the promises of God it will lead you to that faith of the Living God and so you know brother bam talked about the adopted baby and all of those things and and how that you know as someone who can't have a child the adopt a babysit and eventually after they've adopted that baby here they are they they have a child and we've seen that and here was a man that dug down to a foundation and when he when it came time to test this uh uh Bridge he had blasted he had sent dynamite and blasted it away and got down on the Rock and when it came time to walk across on that right there he was out in front and he told him I want every I want every lane filled I want locomotions on this and he was out in front because he was going to display that what I have declared and built I am here standing as a witness of what I have built and you see God himself when God gave his word and remember God is the word god came down himself and he just didn't send his word down like a trial like a scientist in a lab but God himself came down and took upon the fume and form and he stood and he let you and I know I will show to you I will lead you back to Victory and to show to you and how the very Assurance of the word of God a place where you and I could stand where Satan had moved him in the beginning from the word but here he came in a place to be able to establish the word none in a building somewhere because then remember there was a time where the ark went into the holiest of holies but that was only a time that God desired to establish his word in the very heart of the end individual now when we look at how Faith itself within it all Faith displays itself in how in that it hears and it acts and I I say it like this if there's no action upon what you're hearing then there's nothing moving and nothing transpiring an action doesn't mean altogether just saying well agreeing with it but it's allowing the word to come through your life and and giving yourself to the word praying over the word when you see your shortcomings and you see things that the holy spirit is bringing out in your life don't make excuses for it don't allow sand to to become a resting place but go to God In Prayer who in his infinite Mercy is speaking to your heart and dealing with your life and say God let it be Lord in my life Lord let that word become flesh inside of my life this is an ongoing walk with God this is not a walk with God where you have a One-Shot ill and you sit down and you wait until the change of the body that is not what the Rapture is about but it is a continual growing and maturing in Jesus Christ good morning that's what this word come to do a foundation is Lay but remember after what I just read to you a man who the man who hears who hears it who comes to him and he builds up and and he actually takes up on the word and does it he hears a man who built his house on a solid foundation but he just didn't have a foundation he built a house and so the whole part is that within that Foundation is that there would be a place that could solely rest when I was in Arizona and I just looked it up here early this morning it came back to me and I had some brothers that shared with me on some things that had taken place in a development in Utah and I looked at it here this morning and here you find that there were builders that had built on the on the edge of um you know like a a cliff a rock formation and they built there and one was a million dollar house another was 875 000 home and both of these homes they had to remove the people in November and then by the time here after this somewhere just a month down the road the rolling of the the few part uh within the uh the year then they had to completely you know the houses just went right over the edge but what the people started noticing they started seeing cracks and I know they're settling that takes place but this was beyond settling there was cracks and everything all around the house in the in the flooring and everything that was going on and eventually they said hey this is not place that's suitable to dwell in I'm just going to say this to you right now when God builds a house they're in no cracks coming in that house when man builds a house there can be a lot of cracks come in it when we try to do it in our own self there's a lot of cracks can come in it but when God builds a house heavens and earth will pass away but my words shall never pass away because he said Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not be able to Prevail against it why he's established now I want to just deal with this on how faith is faith is a substance faith is acting on what God is speaking his presence moving about our lives brother Ram says it like this he said we find he's talking about for healing he said we find most people are afraid to accept it and usually people who have faith is someone who has experienced faith so to have faith is usually someone who's experienced Faith well how did you experience faith if Faith itself has a source and that source is God when Moses got in the face of the burning bush he had an experience it was different than what his mama had told him because when his mama had told him and he could explain it real well but when push come to shove Moses's Faith boom it exploded it came into a crisis moment like oh what's going on why because it didn't happen the way that he thought it ought to happen you know what he was missing and experience with God people who have faith is someone who has experienced faith and when you accept Jesus as your personal savior there's not a way in the world for you to ever be saved only by your faith you had to accept it you had to believe it you could get down to the Altar and could cry all night long you could beat upon the Altar and scream until you could scream no more and still you're not saved you could feel real good and run all over the building shouting and still not be saved the devil can beat you around the stump on your feelings now I'm not going to ask you to raise your hand the devil could beat you around the stump on your feelings if I had to go now this brother but I'm talking if I had to go on by my feelings there'd be many times that I'd be all out of condition so you mean to tell me brother Branham that there's times that what you're acting on is certainly not your feelings if we could dive into this right here it's showing that there there might be times we feel really good feel on top of the mountain but we're not acting by that I know sometimes you think you are but you're not acting by that a real believer acts from a source that is hidden in an unseen Realm yeah because if you act by your feelings oh he said I'd be all out of condition and I don't rest on my feelings I rest upon the unconditional word of the Living God who made the Covenant with me if I would believe it it's not what I feel it's what I believe Jesus never did say did you feel it he said did you believe it Faith happens it's far beyond feeling I think that's a point to be emphasized Faith happens it's far beyond feeling just because you say well I don't feel anything what does feeling have to do with receiving the word God is speaking to your heart reach out and take that word and say thank you Lord and more word comes thank you Lord come on Friends there's times you go to work and you don't feel like going to work does that stop you from going to work preach with me now or my feelings what does have feelings listen I thank God for feelings I could go I could go a month or Sundays on this I thank God for feelings I'm glad he gave us feelings but he never gave us feelings as a place to rest and base our life on wow that Sands sometimes that sand feels good but there's other times that sand gets blown all around there's gotta be something deeper than my feelings Hallelujah you could feel tonight like you're saved and run around and praising God and the next morning you wouldn't have any feeling about it at all you'd say I'm lost again why feelings but when Faith takes hold that Jesus Christ This is how Faith takes hold that Jesus Christ God's son died in your stead and he become you in your sins that you in your sins might become him in his righteousness and accept him as your only perpetuation for your sins then Faith takes a hold and all Devils out of hell can't move it Faith endures Faith locks something it seals something that's what faith does by faith the elders obtained a good report they had to walk through adversity they had to press through storms they had to overcome mind battles they had to fight the same facts that you and I have to fight oh brother Samuel they don't have the pressures like we have today there hadn't been one more devil added it's the same devil he might come in many different forms but I want to remind you neither have we added another God he's still the almighty God [Music] he overcame then and he's an overcomer now [Applause] if a man has had Faith now watch this to accept Christ he walks up from the altar goes outside his associate says you haven't got nothing why your eyes are still blue that's the same old suit you wore in there why your nose is just as big as it when you went in your fingerprints are just the same there's no difference well duh God didn't come to try to give you a new eye color come on Friends he didn't come to to change you know your suit from a blue into a brown one sorry he didn't come to change your big nose from through a little nose but here's what it is but you know but you know there is a difference and in the ages to come in the days and weeks you'll prove that there's a difference because your faith will vindicate that you're a Christian notice not you your faith will vindicate if thou be the Son of God turn these stones in the bread your faith will vindicate you are a son and daughter of God are you hearing me Satan wanted Jesus to clown for him if thou be if thou be if thou be if thou be but Jesus knew where he was standing he was established you say it was established yes he'd just come out of the River Jordan he was always the word but when he walked up out of the River Jordan he was the word made flesh because it takes the quickening power to come and Quicken the word and make the Word Flesh in our lives are you here man I just don't want to be the word we want to be the word made flesh to where what is behind the veil describes and displays and manifests itself and that can only come by the quickening power of the Shekinah Glory almighty God coming down on the inside and he raises the Son and Daughter of God to a perfect complete manifestation of the glory of God in their life here he was standing quickening power had already come upon him and here he was here he was established established just like when God would speak of David's Kingdom and then when here it was established in Solomon's kingdom then it's established you see God gives his word now his word is settled is that right we looked at that last week's Psalms I believe it's 119. his word was already established from before the foundation of the world God's not coming down and changing it's already settled but God comes in order to establish that word to make it live and that it Finds Its Mark in the lives of his children the Bible said when David knew his kingdom was established when Solomon knew his kingdom was see there come a time to where they knew God the Bible said that the Lord had established him and then he could begin to act but you know there's a difference he says your faith will vindicate that you're a Christian how many knows that to be a truth every man and woman that's ever accepted Christ he says now watch our brother Ram will tie this in them with Divine Healing he said if you can step out and trust your Eternal destination upon your faith how much more can you step out with that little body of yours upon the same atonement that he was wounded for our transgressions and with his stripes we were healed now what's further random doing right here he's getting he's listen this is God's wisdom at work that when a lot of situations and let me say this sometimes a lot of a lot of water can pass under the bridge in our lives and then listen but you never ever when you have been born again of the spirit of God I'm talking about a real new birth that's what I'm preaching on you can never get away from that that is not something that you can ever hang up and oh my I got to put this back on you don't put it on it's what God has done in your life it's a new creation but sometimes we need to be reminded of where God brought us from from the simplicity D that's right there in our life and that's what the Holy Spirit was doing right there pointing them back to an experience they had because there were other needs such as healing in their life there might have been other needs domestically and everything else children so what does it do Point them right back to the grounds that they have as a Believer to the rights that have been given to him and granted by the holy ghost that they can stand upon that and realize the same God the same Faith he inspired me in that moment to walk step by step to come completely into Christ that it's God's work and the same God that did that he's the same God for the healing of my body he's the same God for my children he's the same God for my family he's the same God in every situation what is it it's Faith mastering circumstances Ephesians 3 16. here's Paul's prayer with the Ephesians that he would Grant you now Paul is laid out what has been committed the grace of God is committed unto him and then he goes in to see and he says that he would Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the Inner Man notice strengthened to be established with his power by his Spirit where in the Inner Man not just in our mind not just in our spirit down on the inside because that's established if it just comes upon my spirit that's shifting Sands I can who glory to God in it and I can hold my but it's shifting Sands in just one it'll take a wind and it'll blow away water can wash it away you why are you saying Brother Sam you're talking about I'm talking about an experience where it's established in God that Christ May dwell notice how Paul would take this that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love where would he dwell in your hearts right he can dwell in a person's mind and somebody else will come along and talk you out of that right we've seen that happen friends why is it because it's just there in the intellect it's an intellectual Faith it's not a substance Faith by a Divine experience right notice that he might dwell in your hearts by faith that you being rooted and grounded in Love Now notice this with rooted and grounded how many how many ever seen plants before [Music] only about three of you four of you okay we've seen plants and and trees okay and this is how Paul Likens this dwelling in our hearts by faith that we would become rooted to cause to strike root to strengthen with roots to render firm to fix to establish cause a person or thing to be thoroughly grounded to be grounded in love notice grounded in love is to lay the foundation to be found make stable established ground or settle so it's in his love rooted and grounded in love you know when you plant a plant you can put that plant out put it in the soil and my it's a nice plant somebody can come right along and take that plant and just grab it by the hands if it hasn't been rooted right they can just grab it up and take it away to another location because it hasn't been rooted and do you realize even when you're dealing with even times I'm not going to give you a Horticultural lesson but I think how the scripture continues to talk about a man being planted talk about our lives being established do you realize that how when we look at many times of planting certain types of plants Shrubbery bushes and things like that that when you look within it you have got that you've got to water it but not water it by spraying it here on the leaves the leaves don't need the water but you've got to water it at the base but it don't take a a real massive flowing powerful water because that'll wash all the all the soil away that you've just put on the top of it but what it takes is it takes a slow steady stream of water why because it not only soaks that root ball of that tree but that water keeps going deeper and deeper in the ground you say why do you want the water to go deeper in the ground when the roots are still up here because you're trying to get it rooted and you want to teach the roots go deep for your source of water when I'm not here to water you you've got to have a hidden Source in the midst of drought in the midst of famine you've got to have a source that you're tapped into and that's why the Holy Spirit goes down very purposely in our life let me just tell you something it's that way in our life that just is not something that one time you reach a certain area it keeps going deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper the more that we stay under it verse 18. and may be able to comprehend notice this is part of it be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breath and length and depth and height how many know it's a realm that the person of Jesus Christ is real that to be in Christ is to be in him it's a it's it's a reality it's not just a two-dimensional thing it's a reality it's a living reality a living God that's right here Among Us it's like Abraham when God would anoint his eyes that he would see Abraham everywhere you can see north south east and west I've given you this land I've given you all these things belong to you it's yours hold my and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge that you might be filled with all the fullness of God the passive knowledge can we say Amen that's what the no to know to experience the love of Christ because you can know about the love of Christ many many many people are thanking him for dying for their sins on Calvary but do not see the need of the Divine application upon their soul they look they looked to what was done and say thank you for saving me from your from my sins but do you realize to save you from your sins it means you are no longer dwelling there you've been delivered but you see listen friends the way that the teaching in things is so pervaded it's put Christianity as though that the work and the life of a Believer is something of self-will and self-determination do believe that we need to have a determination but not a determination that's relying on our own works I believe that we need to have works that are inspired by the Holy Ghost and that our determination is a determination from God's spirit by a Divine unction coming upon our life and pulsating in our life I do believe that because it is a well springing up within you right one brother random asks that little thing that little stream who what makes your bubble is it the deer that drink from you is it this is it that I'm going to tell you if that's all you can do is bubble when people are good to you or when they fit your cue or fit right in your frame let me tell you something you need a deeper experience with God but at the same you know that's kind of that's kind of straight I don't know how else to put it friends we're talking about being established if the least little thing comes up and man it upsets your apple cart and you're running here and you're running there you need to understand somebody else is not your problem you need to understand Barry is a greater whole that can come in your life and establish you as a son and daughter of God to where you have dominion over your own feelings will I feel bad sure there's going to be times you feel bad but you've got to have a hidden source something that passes knowledge and be filled with the fullness of God notice brother Ram takes us here in the five timer Church age and he takes these verses of scripture because he's he's going to contrast uh when he's talking about the the right on the depths of Satan and commentators just avoid that that whole line of the fatarian age and brother bear said it's really really simple he said you just have to contrast the depths of Satan to the depths of God and brother Ram goes into and he says when a man he's talking about these scriptures here out of the Tyrant age when a man experiences the depth of God in his life it is an actual personal experience of the spirit of God indwelling him and his mind is illuminated by the wisdom and knowledge of God through the word now I want you to understand that when he experiences the depth of God in his life it's an actual personal experience indwelling him and his mind becomes illuminated by the wisdom and knowledge of god notice this experience simple definition I know but experience it's a practical contact with an observation of facts or events it's an event or occurrence that leaves an impression on someone that's an experience it's a it's a practical observation a practical contact with and an observation of facts or events an event or occurrence that leaves an impression on someone second Peter chapter 1 verse 10 wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence all carefulness to make your calling an election sure notice they admonition make your calling an election sure it's not for the pastor it's not for the church it's for in your own life and your own walk with God to make it sure that you know where you're standing then you know because there not only will be situations that will arise but here we are we're at the end we're at the time of rapture hope so is not good enough you've got to be sure be very very sure that your Anchor Holds and it grabs on the solid rock it's a time to be sure and let me tell you something you know how powerful it is when a person acts sure come on we've heard things you know and I know everybody has different makeups than men that person's awful confident in this and that let me tell you something I understand we all can have our own different makeups about things and and whatever more and and there's times God God places things out I can't even get into that you know God places things in certain positions I mean Paul couldn't be a pushover and be the messenger of the age he couldn't be some mealy mouth and wandering around and he's the messenger of the age it didn't mean he was an arrogant big mouth that's not what Paul was but Paul was a man that there was a confidence that was in him because God had revealed himself to Paul that Paul could stand in the midst even of Peter and call Peter down and said you're acting like a hypocrite right here in front of the rest of the Gentiles and when the Jews are coming down you're acting like this you're taking Listerine for your bacon breath you're throwing away the pork rib bones you're a hypocrite what was he doing he was calling Peter's actions to place because your actions are working to try to undo what God desires to do among the people Hallelujah that's for another day but you see the establishment of what God would call you and I too that we would have a sure walk when you walk sure it's just like when Joshua stood there before the walls of Jericho he drew his sword and he knew right then what God had told him not a man shall be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life that same Surety is when they failed at the Battle of Ahad that same Surety did not cause Joshua to say dear God what have we got ourselves into but that same Surety caused him to reflect in his own life it caused him to reflect in his own walk why there's a surety that I've met God this is what he said and he cannot fail his words can't fail so there ain't nothing wrong with God there must be something hindering the channel right here I tell you that's a mighty conqueror that's an overcomer right there you've got sheer ground to stand on and be able to examine Our Lives the Bible said second Timothy 2 19 nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure having to seal the Lord knoweth them that are his and let everyone that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity well listen God's a sure God isn't he you can you can rest on his word if God has said something in his word you can rest on it if there's something that gets in the way that you know any little thought or feeling Rises up in in the midst of about that a little fear remember that's only Satan trying to keep you back if there's something that's not right there in your life repent of it get it right get it under the blood so that you can lay a hold on the word that God is delivering what is it it's removing all obstacles that hinder faith God is a sure God is that right and he establishes his children in a sure work now notice brother Ram said this let me just let me just bear with me here just a little bit Louis Ram is talking about when Paul was was converted this out of the Hebrew series and brother Brown was talking about how that Paul you know before he ever you know begin to move forward on his experience because he had a marvelous experience how many know that Paul went away in the deserts of Arabia Paul just never ran from the light and said praise be to God I met the light but you see he took the experience he had now listen to me don't just skip this let this part sink deep Paul had an experience but Paul took now out into the desert and here he goes out and you know what it is the desert itself is where that there is no other distractions no other opinions we're I'm just going to lay myself before God because what has happened and what has been spoken Paul wanted to see it confirmed in the word because Paul listen would be an example of the Believers that their lives would be confirmed in the scripture is that right now watch this he says when you accept Christ just as your personal savior it is an experience now listen now I believe the joy of knowing your sin is Forgiven just Thrills your heart through and through so accepting him as a personal savior that is an experience too it Thrills your heart as a matter of fact you feel the Lord that you've been carrying lift up what is that that's forgiveness you've accepted him as your personal savior but remember he wants to be your lord but when this blessed Holy Spirit comes down that's an experience that new birth that you'll never forget you become a child of God and here is what does it I like this how do you know it brother Branham these are teaching lessons he said many people the methodists try to say they shouted when they got it well that's all right if you got it and shout it okay because you shouted wasn't a sign you had it because a lot shouted and didn't have it you see this isn't trying to destroy people is trying to establish people to establish our lives in Christ as Sons and Daughters of God the Pentecostal said they spoke in tongues they got it well that's all right if you speak in tongues and got it all right but you could speak in tongues and still not have it so you see after all it is the experience of passing from Death to life when all the old things die and All Things become new Christ becomes real now notice the experience of passing from Death unto life you take a seed a seed is dead but you plant that seed water that seed and then eventually through the water and the light that seed is quickened and begins to come forth sometimes before you ever see it it has already begin to sprout beneath the dirt but if it did it beneath the dirt guess what it's going to show above the dirt it'll keep on showing it'll keep on growing there'll be leaves it'll grow taller there'll be more flowers why because it's a work where it's no longer dead but it's come to life and Christ becomes real the old things drop away the old roots of carnal notice they didn't you know it didn't you know pulling off the leaves they just drop away why because there's no more there's no more Life Source to them the old roots of carnality you know how to dig a root out we used to take a grubbing hole and get down at it and dig it till there wasn't a speck left in it and they said if there be any root of bitterness spring up and you grub her out and that's what the Holy Spirit does root out all the roots dig them out pile it up burn them get rid of them then you got a good crop let me just say this with all from my heart if they're still with the things that you find in your life that you're still the same way friends that's not what God means by being established establish is not where you're in and out up and down one moment you're a Believer next moment you're not a Believer but to be established is where you're anchored in him and your life has been changed amen even your dog knows you've been changed your cat knows you've been changed your husband knows you've been changed your wife knows you've been changed everybody else knows you've been changed the people on Facebook know you've been changed [Applause] you know why because you're different and it's not a put on it's not picking off leaves it's new life has come in and that new life those leaves are not representative of the life that's in you it's an established life second Corinthians 5 17. I know this is very simple but you know what let's see I thank God for being this simple therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new it didn't say you know everything but old things are passed away how are they passed away because out of here the past has come it's passed from Death unto life it's no longer the same now over and over throughout the scripture the testimony of the Lord has never been to build upon the old but upon the new right said you can't put new wine in all bottles it'll blow up you can't put a new piece in an old quilt it'll stick out like a sore thumb right so it's everything is building upon the new and that's why listen to me the new birth is not God cleaning up a man and building on the same Foundation it's God coming down and not only is he clean the person up but God destroys that first nature and he raises up that seed on the inside by his quickening power and that becomes the foundation of the new birth that becomes the faith of the Living God that grows in the Statue of a perfect man it's a foundation stone in our life so it's not the old man patched up and I'm gonna make it better and make it better and sometimes my heart and I don't sometimes you don't even try to get in and try to you know explain everything there's times to explain it but sometimes you realize when people look at things when I'm going to try to do better and I'm going to try to come to church and I listen I always encourage people you know what because if you at least come into the house of God I got confidence you're in a spot where God can deal with your heart but it ain't just come into the house of God it's it's deeper than I believe you got something in you you want to be in the house of God come on friends I'm preaching the word you want to be in the presence of God not the presence of a computer screen but the presence of God the Bible said for sake not to assemble yourselves together as the manner of some are right that's right I'm quoting now the prophet said you got the love of God in your heart you can't wait to them Church doors are open well I've got all this to do I'd be clearing out anything that hinders me from getting in the house of God where my boss needs me Jesus is Calling on your soul your family needs you to be a real solid a real stable and show them what it means to serve God and put God first above everything else in this life we're talking about truth that establishes amen Jesus said behold I make all things new the Rams asked this question at the instance of receiving the Holy Ghost or the baptism of the Holy Ghost is there any difference so when someone receives it at that instant is there any difference does a person speak with tongues if not always what manifestation is known brother Brian said well could you imagine a mother giving birth to a baby and not knowing it I love the simplicity she'd have to be conscious not to know it neither can you receive the Holy Ghost without knowing it now just watch now follow me now because if you stop on that statement you could be thinking about some sort of a sensation or an emotion I I believe in Sensations I believe in emotions but I don't believe that Sensations or emotions are the evidence because you can have a lot of sensation let me tell you something I had a sensation around the fire last night I got hot I got away from I had another sensation I got cold I got my emotions sometimes fluctuate sometimes I get angry and then other times I'm satisfied my emotions can go back and forth so I'm not resting upon a sensation listen I'm not against sensation I'm not against emotion but this is where it comes down to brother Brown says neither can you receive the Holy Ghost without knowing it so what is then am I looking for there's something takes place in you there's something that changes you your whole system your whole spiritual system is made new again you become a new creature in Christ as the Bible puts in a New Creation in Christ and you know it what is it the old things are passed away how to get you to look at something wrong try to put them pants on again try to put that makeup on again come on Friends try to do those things again what is it the appetite is gone because the things of the world has fled away what did that it's a work of the Holy Ghost in your life whether you had emotion or sensation it's a creative word by the creative power of almighty God that comes on the inside and transforms that life you know you know because why your whole system has changed anybody ever had anything changed where your appetite change for certain things somebody just said my appetite's just in gear right now buddy I've had certain things change certain things and right now that you know that I don't like no more then there's certain things that I just didn't used to like that I like I know it's a very simple natural carnal example but that's just as simple as when the New Birth has come there's things it ain't nobody had to tell you there's certain things that you don't want to do no more there's things I don't got to desire for no more it ain't no I hope I don't do it no more there ain't no desire no more because they can they get their own mind they could stack your closet full of them they could blast your computer with it but there's something on the inside that's greater than every Temptation what is that it's the solid rock and the whole of the establishing power of almighty God it's not on the outside not the things that inner man that defile him it's what comes from the inside that's why brother random says when you say I've got the Holy Ghost he said and there's still things in your life coming out against it makeup he says things you know your mouth and other things are coming out brother brain goes through a whole list and you must be born again when things are coming out that aren't right that's a signification it's not been established yet oh my there's got to be a settled assurance by the word of the Lord brother Brian just says it like this he quotes the scripture out of Hebrews 10 1. I'm coming down here for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers they're into perfect they offered them right and they had to offer them but once the perfect sacrifice came those sacrifices could never deal with the root cause there had to come the perfect sacrifice that all of them were pointing to for when for would they not have ceased to be offered if they made us perfect would they not have ceased to be offered because that the worshipers once purged should have had no more conscience desire of sins so the Perfection is where it removes the very desire every the desire has changed Christ is dwelling in the heart everything's about him your whole life is revolving around him decisions you make about him see that's why when there's things that God works in your life and our lives would grow and maturing you begin to see things more and more in a way that you realize being more and more of the importance of putting spiritual things first it's normally an appetite but there's things that you begin to see the effects of that brother Bram says this in Satan's Eve now I want you just to think of this for a moment brother Bradley's talking about that Tripper once Purge has no more conscience of Sin Sin has passed from him and this quote I referred this quote to you many times and this is always a quote that just I don't know how anyone could say that brother Bram didn't preach on the Holy Ghost but I understand what they're saying here let me read this he said I heard brother Neville say this morning someone might have been asking him why I didn't preach on the Holy Ghost and why I didn't do this here it is you have to remember this is 1965. people are caught here they are it's in a junction so you have individuals that are sitting in the Tabernacle remember the Tabernacle that a lot of you have people that was there that was Baptist right then you had people that come in with Pentecostal then you had people that come in who were methodists so you had you had such a part which was really representative of how God would be assembling his bride to himself but we would not hang on to our identity of Baptist Pentecostal methodists and Lutheran but we take the identity of Christ because we want we recognize his name is above every other name right because so when we see this brother Ram is dealing with this part to really to establish even the people there he says the Holy Ghost is the action in you it's a life not an emotion not some sort of a fleshly evidence but it is a person Jesus Christ the word of God established in your heart to Quicken every word of this age notice he's established in your heart and the word just keeps on becoming alive he's quickening every word he's quickening you're quick into the word it's a living reality you you're seeing the breath type depth you're you're walking in the love of God and it's it's a quickening he's established in your heart but the man says watch the Holy Ghost in action not so much in demonstrations but in action what it does according to the word that's real establishment it's an action that comes forth from within not many many demonstrations that can be done we believe in demonstrations the Bible said that the god that the the gospel came not in word only but in power and demonstration is that right it's the power of God coming down and working dealing with hearts brother Brandon put it as simply as like this where the sword of the Lord comes down and it cuts away unbelief from lives it cuts away diseases it cuts away Devils because do you realize a person might be Desiring to be saved but there's a spirit of unbelief that's got to be Cast Away they can desire certain things but that's why the preaching of the Gospel the sword of the Lord comes the spirits of unbelief it casts them away so that is the children of God we can rise right up into the promises of God maybe it's a spirit of Gloom a spirit of Despair Spirit of depression anxiety whatever it might be the word of God comes to deal with that so that you might be able to take a hold on the promise of almighty God it comes to establish us let me just stop there much more than I have here in front of me but we just stopped there becomes the word of God comes to establish us and to lead us and guide us into all truth when he has come he will lead and guide us into all truth it's an experience that establishes us you see if it's just if it's just taking knowledge of the message doctrines without an experience that house is headed for a great fall and I don't want you just to think about your own self but think about your family too think about others that are around you your children whether they're here whether they're grown it's important that in your life my life in our walk that not only are we established but we are continually being established in the word of God growing deeper not in our own reasonings but in the word of God amen God establishing us rooting us Paul would go on to say in another place rooting us establishing us strengthening us in our walk with God to be stronger today than we were before if God tarries to be stronger the next day to be stronger than next week by what by him as he comes to establish us to strengthen us and I look at this this right here when we begin looking at this last week because we you see such a thing with the with the unsettledness you see such things with unsettlements I believe it's a Time to be very settled I believe it's a Time To Know Who You Are who your father is and where you belong right I believe it's a time to be settled that we know in whom we have believed and our feet are on Solid Ground because when we are standing right there and we look it it does US good to look to see where our feet are standing because if you're not there this morning you'll want to get there you want to let the spirit of God come down and operate on your faith to where it becomes a faith that's set it's locked it's unmovable why because it's God's faith operating in your heart your feelings remember what I opened that with your feelings at times my feelings at times there's times that you don't feel like a good Christian you don't feel but it's not your feelings that's why I said there's got to be something deeper because the new birth is not something you can ever get away from it it ain't something that you say well you know I just I just ran out in the world and I'd say I was like this and all of a sudden I came back thank God that the new birth and the new birth don't do that sorry the new birth don't do that it is an anchor of the Soul you might have had a knowledge that you couldn't get away of the knowledge of the truth but the knowledge of the truth and the person of the truth is different it's to have an experience to know the love of God because people can have a knowledge of the truth and they can go every which way they can go on dance floors they can go everywhere out there and they've got a knowledge of it but if you got the personal truth on the inside you'll never want to go back out to a dance floor brother Samuel that's putting it off astray that's Solid Ground that's a place that you can put your faith on and you know in your heart there ain't nothing about a dance floor in my life there is nothing there there's no desire for it so you know what there's no fear of the world perfect love casts out all fear I'm not afraid of going back there's nothing to go back to how can you say that there's nothing in here that wants to go back I'm not connected with the world if you love the world or the things of the world the love of the father is not even in you that's why it's to be very sure and brother Brennan brings it right down in greatest about her thought he said if you're doing the right things only because it's right and you still have a desire for the wrong you're still not right that's why keeping the law ain't enough it's got to be something deeper than just what I know is right it's got to be a confession from the heart that Jesus Christ indeed is risen that he is savior he's Redeemer he's Lord and he's enthroned in my life [Applause] [Music] sure established because as we're established we grow and the spirit of God moving in our hearts and our lives and we're not the same we're not the same I can look back even years ago I can look back even a year ago I can look back on things I'm not saying this to brag because this I'm kind of ahead on things and layers of this but I will say this to you the Holy Spirit does not leave us as babies he don't leave us as babies but he wants us to grow up into him in all things what's he doing further establishing us what's he doing bringing Sons and Daughters of God into adoption into Authority confidence that's moving in our lives it's not that we don't have that Authority now as Sons and Daughters of God we do but you see it's all released not just wide open it's all based on character power without character so in order for increased power and authority it's increased character increased character increase suffering what does increased suffering mean it means from lives that are giving themselves more to God because many are the afflictions of the righteous and the Lord delivereth him out of them all right are you hearing me that's why sometimes as we said before we say tests and trials if your life is not walking on with God then I would not be calling it a test or trial it'd be looking at it as chastening from God to begin to examine our lives and say where am I at with God why so I can be clear I can be straight you love him established oh I know it may not have been a shouting and you know off the off the roof and everything I realize that and I'm okay with that because it's pastor I'm okay with that but I do know this right here my heart's desires for every life and for every heart to be established and continue to be established in him that our lives grow as individuals that Christ is enthroned in our hearts and I'd say to you this morning if your faith is not come to that place yet let God come down and operate on your faith be honest with him be honest with first of all if you can't be honest with yourself you'll never be honest with God but you've got to be honest with yourself there that I'm not there yet and maybe in your heart you're not even there yet in your heart but at least to be honest and say God get my heart to that place Lord help me Lord let my heart come into that place to where Lord it begins to really it's not just what's wrong but My Heart Lord God to be right to be longing after you Lord to come to that place to be broken Lord to where you can move amen and that's establishing in our hearts how the Holy Spirit moving old things are passed away I think it seem how he rooting things out in our life there's things that God Roots out in our life and he takes out in our life and things how the holy spirit continues to move and change us from Glory unto Glory he's doing that it's a continual work of the Holy Spirit moving in our life transforming US changing us from Glory unto Glory let's pray Heavenly Father Lord Jesus Lord how we we thank you God for them the simplicity Lord of your word Lord I pray his way think about Lord through this moment this service they just asked that God that if there's one Lord that's here the Lord has never come to that place of a real settledness in their heart Lord they've met you that Lord like you laid it out so clear here in the message but lord it's an experience that is known on the inside where the whole spiritual where the whole system changes on the inside owned leaves drop off not us plucking them off Lord father I pray God here this morning Lord would you just would you grant that Lord in a special way would you grant the courage in the hearts Lord of your children Lord if there's one that is not Lord experience that Lord father it doesn't matter Lord God of how old they are it doesn't matter how long that they've even been coming Lord you don't give your word to pick pick on us Lord you give your word Lord you speak to us that we might be established and that we might grow and Lord throughout this this life and this journey and realize Lord that today very much this morning we dealt very much Lord upon the beginnings but God we all want to continue to grow Lord to continue to be established Lord in you in your working in your leading Lord granted Lord I pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen and amen I can't think of any other any other Joy just sing whatever's on your heart I can't think of any other Joy or any greater Delight and see Christ established in our hearts and our lives you say why is that brother Sammy well I'll tell you why because I know there's a lot of adversities I know there's a lot of tests I know there's a lot of trial but it ain't just about tests and trials and adversity you're not you you we don't we don't serve God just so we can make it through adversity adversity comes if all we saw was adversity if we saw some of the tests that we had to go through at first if we've solved some if God let us know some of the things that we've passed through I'm sure we would have looked and we would have fainted yeah sure see that's why sometimes when sometimes a person looks at they look at serving the lord but they look at it in terms of I got to give this up and I got to give that up and I got you're looking at the wrong thing if you can ever get a real clear glimpse of calvary if you can ever get a real clear glimpse of him if that that person can just get a glimpse of him then everything else God will take care of everything else in your life as a love of God begins to work it's about a personal relationship with Jesus Christ it establishes in your heart establishes in our life and sure adversities will come sure tests and trials are disappointments will come offenses will come oh my but there's something there's an anchor that holds in the midst of it all stabilizes us it's a victory in our life brother Brown would say it like this in Jubilee year he says you can find that person he says they got victory he said on this day of the week Victory on that day of the week he said they got Victory when they're out of a trial and they got Victory when they're in a trial he said what is that he said that's not your spirit he said that's the Holy Spirit [Music] it's something he does within us I look at them I think God if I did I mean if I didn't have that that's what I'd want more than anything else I'd want that establishment in my heart I'd want to know in whom I have believed because it affects your relationships it affects everything else around you when you know where you're standing it affects everything because then you know what happens just just not even about what you say but just the atmosphere that then is around you it's changed it's a Son of God a daughter of God registers and atmosphere about your life it's the atmosphere of the Holy Spirit [Music] let me just say this to you even in your own life I believe God has spoke so deeply of what to look at even today maybe some of you struggled you've looked at things you've looked in your life and you're well how could I make this mistakes or how could I and listen friends I'm not talking about willful sin I'm talking about when you look down in your life to be able to see that your whole system has been changed the desires have been changed the things that once held you in bondage no longer hold you in bondage any longer things that once ruled you I'm not going to do this or I'm not going to look at that I'm not going to do this I'm not going to do that I'm not going to wear this I'm not going to do this I'm not going to say this I'm not going to oh I can't do that and you realize you don't have to be controlled no more [Music] God never made you to be the tale you're to be the head that's what he makes you to be and he works to establish you and to build you maybe there's areas in your life right here this morning you say God I need some building I need some establishing I need some further strengthening things that God deals with very very very personally why don't you just invite him walk the anointing of the holy spirit is here his word has went forth It's a time to reach
