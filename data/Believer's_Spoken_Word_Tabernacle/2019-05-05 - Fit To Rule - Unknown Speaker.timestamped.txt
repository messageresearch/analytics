[37:38] just speak your into heart and have your
[37:50] a man I believe he can speak just this
[37:53] morning Amen hallelujah give him praise
[37:57] amen hallelujah amen I believe we've
[38:01] received a word in this day a man I
[38:04] believe he wants to speak to us you know
[38:06] if one word from the adversary could
[38:08] cause every hospital every sickness
[38:11] every cemetery every funeral that was
[38:13] ever preached is because of one word one
[38:15] word from the enemy amen but if one word
[38:17] from God could come today what can he do
[38:19] in our lives he's more than able to give
[38:21] us exceedingly abundantly above anything
[38:23] we could ask her think I believe that
[38:25] he's greater today than that word that
[38:26] for cause to fall in the garden I
[38:28] believe is a grace here the Senate
[38:30] that's a present today that you can't
[38:32] fall from Amen because this bride the
[38:34] Prophet said she's predestinated not to
[38:37] fall hey man we've got a word today
[38:39] maybe just come and speak one word into
[38:41] our lives he could change everything
[38:43] this morning amen amen god bless she was
[38:46] good to see you we're just so happy to
[38:48] be with you again we just always
[38:49] appreciate the Spirit of God and the
[38:51] different ones here
[38:52] you brought them with you amen and
[38:55] that's what makes it special because
[38:57] when the service is over and we all go
[39:00] home today if the Lord should tarry
[39:02] maybe we will have to wait that long but
[39:04] maybe our loved ones come walk in the
[39:05] back door during the middle of service
[39:07] I'd be alright with that if we go home
[39:09] today man you take him with you and that
[39:11] that's what makes this special we can
[39:13] come here and we can sing and that's all
[39:15] good and fine but to know that he said
[39:17] he'd never leave us or forsake us he's
[39:20] he's not left us to lead ourselves
[39:21] around could you imagine trying to
[39:23] wander around find your own way through
[39:25] life on your own you know it would it
[39:28] would be a disaster you know just to
[39:31] think that even since old times they've
[39:33] had they they traveled by the Stars and
[39:36] the Sun and and and they we've always
[39:38] needed a sense of direction and how much
[39:40] more God has given us a man who wrote
[39:42] three Bibles is that right so God's
[39:44] never left us without a witness the
[39:45] Bible says and so we're so thankful for
[39:47] that and I just I just feel good to be
[39:51] here with you this morning
[39:52] and I'm gonna keep talking if I don't
[39:54] take my attacks so I'll have you open
[39:56] your Bibles here to Isaiah
[39:59] the 55th chapter and speaking of
[40:03] leadership I I was seeking the will of
[40:06] God which way to go and that's a good
[40:10] thing to do anyway
[40:11] I really didn't know even this morning
[40:14] is on the way here and this is just
[40:16] kinda the Lord brought me to and I pray
[40:19] to be a blessing to you Isaiah the 55th
[40:21] chapter we're gonna read the first four
[40:23] verses this morning and I want to talk
[40:26] about fits to rule where the RAM said
[40:31] that power without character is satanic
[40:34] amen the power with characters fit to
[40:37] rule I want to talk about that this
[40:39] morning we're looking at the first four
[40:40] verses the Bible says ho every one that
[40:43] thirst if come ye to the waters and he
[40:45] that hath no money come you buy any yeh
[40:49] come buy wine and milk without money and
[40:52] without price wherefore do you spend
[40:55] money for that which is not bread and
[40:57] your labor for that which satisfies not
[41:00] hearken diligently unto me and eat that
[41:04] which is good and let your soul delight
[41:06] itself in fatness
[41:09] he says incline your ear and come unto
[41:12] me here and your soul shall live and I
[41:16] will make an everlasting covenant with
[41:18] you even the shore mercies of David I
[41:21] could preach a whole nother sermon that
[41:22] was just a thought but this is what
[41:23] Christ has received the sure mercies of
[41:25] David God made a covenant with David
[41:27] that after his seed is that right after
[41:29] his seed he would put a one on the
[41:32] throne to rule over Israel Jesus being
[41:35] the son of David and I one look at this
[41:37] fourth verse this morning really for the
[41:39] text were taken here speaking about
[41:40] David the Bible says this about him
[41:43] behold I have given him for a witness to
[41:47] the people a leader and a commander to
[41:51] the people let's just bow our heads for
[41:52] a word of Prayer
[41:55] Heavenly Father were so thankful for the
[41:58] word which has been read this morning
[42:00] Lord to know that
[42:03] to know that men have suffered and died
[42:05] that they might preserve this by
[42:08] believing and even that we might have in
[42:10] our own language this morning that it
[42:11] might be made available to us known that
[42:14] the Catholic Church sought to keep it
[42:15] out of the hands of the people and
[42:17] different ones that were burned at the
[42:19] stake and they suffered Lord men and
[42:22] women who believe this war they watch
[42:25] their own children suffer and were
[42:27] tortured because they believe the words
[42:29] of this viable more than what a priest
[42:32] or an organization would teach them and
[42:34] to know that you preserved this Bible
[42:37] these scriptures for us down through the
[42:39] quarters of Time Lord it's a remarkable
[42:41] thing but Lord it's remarkable to me to
[42:44] think that as you preserve this word in
[42:46] this book this morning so to have you
[42:48] preserved your seed through ancestry and
[42:53] through down the corridors of time or
[42:54] maybe maybe bootleggers or whatever kind
[42:58] of a pass we come out of Lord we were a
[43:00] people who are not a people but you've
[43:02] made us the people of God and as we
[43:04] stand here we bear witness this morning
[43:06] that just as you preserved this
[43:08] scripture so to have you preserved that
[43:11] word that you placed in our lives father
[43:14] when we were wayward from me when we
[43:16] weren't looking for direction you come
[43:18] and you come to us or we weren't looking
[43:20] for you but you came and found us you
[43:23] left the 99 to come to us Lord when we
[43:26] were in darkness when we were in the
[43:28] miry clay and we made our bed in Hell
[43:31] Lord yet you were there with us and you
[43:34] found us and with a strong arm you drew
[43:37] us out and you brought us to this place
[43:38] you've set our feet upon a rock Lord the
[43:42] revelation of Jesus Christ in your
[43:45] people today lo we're so grateful for
[43:47] that
[43:47] and Lord I marvel as the scripture says
[43:51] to behold what manner of love you have
[43:53] for us Lord you loved us more than than
[43:56] just that they're just as a servant or
[43:58] just as a friend but you loved us to
[44:00] cause the sons of God behold now are we
[44:04] the sons of God and the Lord as I think
[44:06] of this great love that you would send
[44:08] your son to across to die for
[44:11] to know what you paid for a sort of I'm
[44:15] so persuaded this weren't Lord if you
[44:16] would do all that for us or you're not
[44:18] leave us to our own devices this morning
[44:20] but surely you would come and bless and
[44:23] speak to your people once again Lord you
[44:26] would meet us where I and you would lift
[44:28] us up a little bit higher because you
[44:30] desire for a people to go to rapture to
[44:34] overcome every darkness of Laodicea and
[44:37] never pass every device of the enemy
[44:39] that in the midst of Satan's eating he
[44:42] would draw pride for Jesus Christ and
[44:44] have preeminence lord I just pray right
[44:47] now that you'd come and take full
[44:49] control in the service Lord take these
[44:51] lips of clay and speak through them or
[44:53] take these ears and these hearts and
[44:55] these eyes and bear witness once again
[44:58] but the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[45:00] you know life is a gray and low we'll be
[45:03] careful to give you all the praise and
[45:05] all the glory for we asking the mighty
[45:07] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[45:09] and the bride says Amen god bless his
[45:13] you're seated talking about being fit to
[45:15] rule the idea of leadership you know
[45:17] brother Graham preaches on leadership
[45:18] and he you know he preaches the young
[45:20] people he preaches the businessmen and
[45:22] he preaches this different idea and he
[45:24] has it he says you've heard it preached
[45:26] certain ways before and he take a
[45:27] different I so there's so many aspects
[45:29] of leadership in our life amen
[45:31] and brother Brandon he makes the
[45:33] statement about leadership he said you
[45:34] know Moses because he said when we're
[45:36] from the time that we were born we're
[45:39] being led by something he said Moses
[45:41] when he was born he had a he had a godly
[45:43] mother how many's thinking for godly
[45:45] mothers a man I believe we got some here
[45:47] this morning I believe I got a wife
[45:49] that's like that he said he had a godly
[45:51] mother and she taught him that he was
[45:52] born to be a deliverer he was born with
[45:55] a purpose and I want you to understand
[45:57] brother Branham says a mommy before
[45:59] Matthew Mark and Luke and John get to
[46:01] him
[46:01] mommies there she's the fifth gospel and
[46:05] then so look it's not just a CEO and a
[46:07] business but leadership isn't if you're
[46:10] a mother or if you're somebody
[46:11] somebody's looking at your life
[46:13] somewhere a man somebody's watching you
[46:15] whether you realize it or not it might
[46:17] be in your home it might be a church it
[46:19] might be the job whatever it is
[46:21] somebody's watching this yep this was a
[46:23] mighty man he'd he got his didn't
[46:25] doctors his doctor his master's degree
[46:27] in engineering and warfare need he
[46:30] learned all these things and yet with
[46:32] all the education and then you know some
[46:35] people get scared of education what
[46:36] listen education is not the problem but
[46:38] it's what it leads you to amen because
[46:40] sometimes education will lead you to a
[46:42] spirit of education now I know all
[46:44] spirit of devil amen the brother bands
[46:46] is am NOT supporting ignorance I'm glad
[46:48] for the car I drove here this morning
[46:49] I'm glad for the for all the science and
[46:52] the medicine that we have I'm thankful
[46:54] those things amen
[46:55] but we have to watch the spirit of it I
[46:57] want you to understand that even though
[46:59] this man he was an educated man he'd
[47:01] been taught in the wisdom of the
[47:03] Egyptian and everything he'd learned yet
[47:05] there was something in his life that
[47:07] stuck with him from the time he was a
[47:09] little kid when he's a 40 year old man
[47:11] and he's successful he knows he's gonna
[47:13] have power and authority in Egypt he can
[47:17] look at the mud fields of Egypt and see
[47:19] a bunch of nobody's stopping money the
[47:21] tricks and there was something in his
[47:24] heart that Mommy played place there when
[47:26] he was just a little kid stuck with him
[47:28] there all his college and they're always
[47:30] learning and they're all successes in
[47:32] life then he was born to be a delivery
[47:35] to those people there was something that
[47:37] stuck with him he couldn't get away from
[47:39] it it's so working so burning his heart
[47:42] so he looked at those people they were
[47:45] owned bondage covered in mud and he
[47:48] esteemed the reproach of Christ greater
[47:51] than the riches of Egypt there was
[47:54] something that moved in his heart he
[47:56] said I've got to have what they've got
[47:58] this is a man that got everything in the
[48:01] natural he might have been a big
[48:03] celebrity nowadays their TV star a
[48:06] sports star and you think about young
[48:09] people they're looking to some sort of
[48:11] leadership so many people in the world
[48:12] mommy's always golfing daddy's always
[48:14] gone and they're trying to be like a
[48:16] celebrity they're trying to be like some
[48:18] great somebody they they're looking for
[48:20] leadership somewhere but God give you a
[48:23] fifth gospel God give us his word not
[48:26] the fashion ourselves after that but
[48:28] there's a reproach of Christ it's
[48:30] in Hollywood it's greater than raising
[48:33] that this country can offer you hey my
[48:36] my my we can look at this country we
[48:41] could well praise the Lord you can look
[48:43] at the last few actions you can look all
[48:45] over this country you look through the
[48:46] world and you can see what I'm talking
[48:49] about amen
[48:50] you have people that are in position of
[48:52] authority they've got an influence or
[48:55] maybe they've got Authority or whatever
[48:56] it is and they're in a position of
[48:58] leadership but they lack leadership
[48:59] ability so hell frizz or something all
[49:02] often cuz you done worked a job like
[49:04] that before
[49:05] hey listen I've had a lot of bosses and
[49:09] I'm not trying to be critical but I've
[49:10] had more bad ones than good ones jobs
[49:13] I've worked at they make I get a witness
[49:15] it meant a couple of year but you agree
[49:17] I mean I've had a lot worse listen man
[49:20] man he knows some money or you
[49:22] somebody's friend and he's in a position
[49:23] of authority but he lacks the character
[49:26] to rule or to lead hey man he lacks that
[49:31] that's something that was inside Moses
[49:33] that directed his heart toward God even
[49:36] when he was in the world when he was a
[49:38] great big somebody there was something
[49:39] in him that directed him back to God and
[49:41] we find people they've got every kind of
[49:43] motive and every kind of a reason for
[49:45] what they're doing whether it's money or
[49:47] popularity or women or whatever and they
[49:50] lock something to sleep that's directing
[49:52] them amen I believe there's one
[49:54] leadership that man needs amen
[49:56] and you can look through the history of
[49:58] humanity and find that man he's unable
[50:00] to lead himself and maybe he raised up a
[50:02] ruler maybe he's even a decent King or a
[50:04] decent ruler and what happens is after a
[50:06] while he dies he men well namesake my my
[50:10] daddy cuz we're great you named me after
[50:11] Alexander the Great had a lot better
[50:14] aspirations for me than I did Alexander
[50:17] the nobody whatever Hey and there's a
[50:20] man that you look at history and he
[50:22] conquers the known world by the age of
[50:25] 33
[50:26] well I'm 36 I'm still trying to mow my
[50:28] yard mowed and then I don't know what I
[50:30] go on half the time they meant strunk I
[50:32] pay my bills and here's the guy that has
[50:34] conquered the known world by the age of
[50:36] 33 and yet he dies in this whole kingdom
[50:38] and it's all achievement it
[50:40] it turns into nothing the only thing
[50:43] you've got to be thankful for today is
[50:44] that your Bibles in Greek because of him
[50:46] the originally Testaments in Greek came
[50:49] in because of that and then Amanda might
[50:51] have great charisma or maybe great
[50:54] talent and yet he lacks the character to
[50:57] be a real leader amen so why'd you say
[51:00] why you says because many times we talk
[51:02] about following brother Brant talking
[51:03] about leadership we try to follow the
[51:05] right kind of leadership hey man and
[51:07] what I want you to understand is if you
[51:08] follow the right kind of leadership you
[51:10] will have the same kind of character as
[51:12] that leadership Amen because a disciple
[51:14] that is perfectly trained he's just like
[51:17] his master so Jesus said is that right
[51:20] do you look at this man David I won't
[51:22] take this text because I like how God
[51:24] puts us in here amen he says this and
[51:26] the fourth verses is behold I have given
[51:29] him for a witness the people and the
[51:31] first thing I want you notice about
[51:32] David because God uses David is an
[51:34] example a man the first thing he says
[51:36] about David before he mentions his
[51:38] qualifications is as I have given him
[51:40] that's the very first thing he says I
[51:42] gave you David I gave David to the
[51:46] people for a reason I watch understand
[51:49] if you're sitting here this morning and
[51:51] you are a Christian God has a purpose in
[51:54] your life and it's more than just a warm
[51:56] appeal it's more than just to go work a
[51:58] job from 9:00 to 5:00 there's a gift and
[52:01] a purpose in your life and many times we
[52:04] let the cares of life distract us from
[52:06] the calling that God has placed in her
[52:08] life and then I think about the marvel
[52:11] of human potential just just in the
[52:12] natural you're looking at human being
[52:14] you know you yeah I think so many times
[52:17] you know the world's looking for a cure
[52:19] for cancer I was looking for the next
[52:20] big breakthrough in engineering
[52:22] something for all these different things
[52:23] and I wonder how many times are we
[52:26] guilty in this country of destroying the
[52:29] answer to what we're looking for watts
[52:31] in the womb think about what I'm saying
[52:34] out of this country millions of children
[52:36] murder before they're even born and
[52:38] maybe one of them has the potentials and
[52:42] then you look at a child and raising the
[52:43] wrong kind of a home they're raising a
[52:45] home with abuse and vice and how they go
[52:48] off wayward in life and they think maybe
[52:50] chotto move that child were placed in
[52:53] the right kind of a leadership the right
[52:55] common atmosphere might be the next
[52:57] great doctor the next great surgeon and
[52:59] what have they done they've destroyed
[53:01] the potential
[53:02] there's Gibson their life just in the
[53:05] natural that have been given to us and
[53:08] how much more is a Christian God has
[53:10] placed things in your life hey man don't
[53:11] you don't have to be the pastor to have
[53:13] gifted her life the manifestations of
[53:15] spirits given everything the Bible says
[53:17] the Prophet Eamon sisters you've got a
[53:19] purpose hey man hallelujah brothers
[53:22] you've got a purpose whether you're
[53:25] eight years old or eight years old God
[53:26] can use you
[53:27] I marvel at all the different times in
[53:30] the Bible God you know how many times in
[53:32] the Bible to take somebody's really old
[53:34] or really young and use them he'll take
[53:35] a Jeremiah it's just a child he'll take
[53:37] Moses and wait till he's 80 years old so
[53:39] now you're ready now you're ready for
[53:41] your work now you're ready for the
[53:43] minister hey man god you're not
[53:45] disqualified but your natural ability
[53:48] amen that's the best thing about the
[53:49] kingdom you're not disqualified by some
[53:52] natural barrier
[53:53] Amen all you need to have is the right
[53:56] character the right leadership if Christ
[53:59] is in your heart leading and guiding you
[54:02] he'll take you into all truth
[54:05] amen the Bible says they that are led of
[54:08] the Spirit they are the sons of God you
[54:11] believe that so if you're a son of God
[54:13] this morning if your daughter of God
[54:14] you've got leadership present in your
[54:16] life whether you always recognize their
[54:18] heart he's always there
[54:20] he's always leading he's always
[54:22] directing he's not left us on our own
[54:24] it's all right he's giving us gifts he
[54:27] gave gifts to the church like he gave
[54:29] David he gave gifts to the church he
[54:31] gave some apostles prophets evangelists
[54:33] pastors teachers
[54:34] why were they given for you brother the
[54:38] great gifting is alive what was he
[54:40] giving it was for you the gift was not
[54:43] for him you're not here from your own
[54:48] ambition God put you here for a reason
[54:51] you might have 10 talents you might have
[54:54] five you might be able to bang on a drum
[54:56] with it with a box wrench and that might
[54:59] be your only gift
[55:00] you got one Talent amen you can bury it
[55:02] in the ground or you can use it in the
[55:04] service of Almighty God I matter
[55:11] David's own life he was given he's a
[55:13] gift to the people I meant it's a type
[55:15] of Christ is that right I'll think about
[55:17] David here's a man the Bible says a man
[55:19] after God's own heart that's a pretty
[55:21] good testimony hey man I hope they they
[55:23] can say that about I hope God can say
[55:25] that about me
[55:26] that's good in my life there is a man
[55:27] after my own heart
[55:29] yeah David big mistakes come on summer
[55:32] that's all right hey man listen we all
[55:34] make mistakes huh that don't disqualify
[55:36] you he was given by God he was given by
[55:40] God now I'm not justifying his mistakes
[55:41] I'm not justifying his fail here but
[55:44] what I'm saying is God is greater than
[55:45] his failure God is greater than his
[55:47] mistakes
[55:48] God was greater than his humanity David
[55:51] hundreds of blood of bulls and goats
[55:53] what can he do for his bride
[55:55] let's gathered here this morning and
[55:57] don't matter what kind of a posse of God
[55:59] and don't matter what kind of a family
[56:01] you come from God can use him he can
[56:03] lead you this morning amen the Bible
[56:11] says I have given him as well a witness
[56:14] I'm looking this idea of a witness this
[56:16] morning in his own life the Bible says
[56:18] he was given as a witness you know I
[56:20] think one of the most obvious hallmarks
[56:23] of a good leader is somebody knows what
[56:24] they're talking about because a lot of
[56:27] them know amen
[56:30] you mean brother well I don't know I
[56:32] tell you why I'm in the Christian
[56:34] bookstore a little while but you can go
[56:35] in the Christian bookstore and you can
[56:37] find a hundred different books by a
[56:39] hundred different authors let's say a
[56:41] hundred different things they've all got
[56:43] their own idea and they're all trying to
[56:45] you know bestseller list
[56:46] hey man but how many machs you know in
[56:48] the talk around the premises and the
[56:51] first sermon on the message facing the
[56:52] substance he says we find many people
[56:54] talk a lot about faith but when it comes
[56:57] down to it they don't really know what
[56:58] they're talking about and then they
[57:00] don't stand up in a showdown hey man

[57:05] soldiers

[57:24] little boy he's a witness this morning

[59:01] David we've got to know that the Spirit
[59:04] of God bears witness with our spirit
[59:08] this is one thing if I get up here and I
[59:10] tell you God heals the sick well the
[59:13] Bible says God heals a sick let's sure
[59:15] what's another one I can tell you I've
[59:17] been in my life
[59:19] I've been sick where I didn't know what
[59:20] to do and the doctors didn't know how to
[59:22] move and I prayed and I seen God come
[59:25] down I know he's a healer I've seen him
[59:29] right hey man hey man I was talking I
[59:37] was talking to a gentleman here a while
[59:40] back this is a long story I'm gonna make
[59:41] it real short but this man is a the
[59:44] grand whatever the Jehovah Witness
[59:46] Kingdom Hall my town Pumbaa or whatever
[59:47] it is I know the call wizard it was here
[59:50] they're kind of weird name that God and
[59:54] he got my name when we were talking
[59:55] about the Bible and I was talking to him
[59:57] that Jesus Christ he's the same
[59:59] yesterday today forever he began to tell
[1:00:02] me how this part of my Bible don't mean
[1:00:03] that anymore this part my logo don't
[1:00:05] mean anymore I said well life God heals
[1:00:07] the sick is it God oh he don't do that
[1:00:09] anymore here that's not what God does he
[1:00:11] stopped doing that and finally I said I
[1:00:13] looked at him cuz he want him to listen
[1:00:15] to me and I wasn't really listening to
[1:00:16] him at that point when you tell me not
[1:00:20] to believe what the Bible says I usually
[1:00:21] shut down on you and I finally looked at
[1:00:24] that man said you know what I can take
[1:00:26] you to a little boy that was five years
[1:00:28] old and he was deaf and dumb and God
[1:00:30] opened his ears and God opened his mouth
[1:00:32] I can show you a man that was blind in
[1:00:34] his eyes and God opened his eyes I could
[1:00:36] take you to a woman she was crippled and
[1:00:39] God raised her up I can give you a
[1:00:40] testimony after testimony of God what
[1:00:44] I've seen in my life God do I said if
[1:00:47] you want I'll give you their emails I'll
[1:00:49] give you their phone numbers and you can
[1:00:51] calm up and you can let them know who
[1:00:54] they got healed by false doctrine that's
[1:00:56] just a psychology they just worked up
[1:00:58] and you like that now he let me know
[1:01:02] that you think the devil is more
[1:01:03] powerful and God yes for me and my house
[1:01:06] we're gonna serve this God cuz that same
[1:01:09] God that did that to that woman that
[1:01:12] healed that little boy that made them
[1:01:13] all he's the same daughter he's my body
[1:01:16] he's the same sin your mouth that's the
[1:01:19] kind of God I want to serve I'll tell
[1:01:23] you what he sound like some of the men
[1:01:24] that look at a glass that morning they
[1:01:26] got a big old devil
[1:01:28] it's time to switch gods it's time to
[1:01:30] get a real guard behind you the Holy
[1:01:32] Ghost and fire Jesus Christ the same I
[1:01:35] don't need a bunch of theology and a
[1:01:37] bunch of nonsense
[1:01:38] I'm not impressed by The Devil's bus
[1:01:40] this morning then wasn't impressed by
[1:01:44] the devil's bus hit men of God that was
[1:01:47] bigger than your eyes he was bigger than
[1:01:53] a lion bigger than all his problems
[1:01:55] bigger than all his fears and he knew
[1:02:00] that the God that stood behind him was
[1:02:02] greater than any prominent lay before
[1:02:04] him there wasn't about a bear or a lion
[1:02:07] or giant there was enough Philistines to
[1:02:10] make him back down he heard from God
[1:02:13] he'd been anointed to be a king and he
[1:02:16] knew God was faithful oh he knew he was
[1:02:24] called to it he knew he was called to be
[1:02:26] a king and there wasn't enough Devils in
[1:02:29] hell to stop it from coming to pass
[1:02:32] there weren't enough Spears of the camp
[1:02:34] of the Philistines just stopped him from
[1:02:37] being a king he's a witness amen see a
[1:02:45] witness he doesn't have to compel you by
[1:02:47] the threat of force enough to compel you
[1:02:50] with education they're learning he
[1:02:52] compels you by the conviction of his
[1:02:54] testimony that you know no matter what
[1:02:57] there's something to happen in that man
[1:02:59] there's something that happened that
[1:03:01] woman they know they met God on them
[1:03:03] sacred sands and you couldn't drag it
[1:03:05] out of them with enough wild annals
[1:03:07] there's not enough money you could pay
[1:03:09] them to make him deny the Lord they met
[1:03:11] something real and that's something to
[1:03:13] smoke back to them then nothing
[1:03:16] they run away they ain't giving up oh oh
[1:03:21] yeah that's what we need to do this once
[1:03:24] throw off their old wishbone and get a
[1:03:26] backbone in here some of us need to get
[1:03:29] the wishbone chuck it out the window you
[1:03:32] don't need a wishbone in church we're
[1:03:33] not praising some magic Genie somewhere
[1:03:36] we're not
[1:03:37] the dashing hope and so we serve a
[1:03:38] living God he's never failed it's never
[1:03:41] been defeated
[1:03:42] oh mama the Bible tells us
[1:03:50] listen everybody can have an opinion hey
[1:03:52] man the men all had an opinion but David
[1:03:54] had something else here vindication hit
[1:03:57] the life behind it to back it up hey man
[1:04:00] the Bible tells us in the book of Acts
[1:04:02] that Jesus Christ Jesus of Nazareth a
[1:04:04] man approved of God

[1:04:08] hanging on his wall hey mr. Greenhills
[1:04:12] lon he didn't have a card in his wallet
[1:04:13] saying I've been approved by God amen he
[1:04:16] wasn't on the up somewhere was a
[1:04:17] five-star review hey many didn't get
[1:04:20] some accolade from some website on
[1:04:21] Facebook the Bible says he was approved
[1:04:24] of God by signs and by one nation

[1:17:04] another your what was bought with the
[1:17:06] blood well shoot anyhow divine

[1:17:17] the Bible the Bible says that we stay to
[1:17:19] show ourselves to be a perfect name and
[1:17:20] God's approval the witness of the Holy
[1:17:23] Ghost what is it it's a seal that your
[1:17:25] faith is really accepted and when you've

[1:17:46] through the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:17:49] hey man I see a witness this won't come
[1:17:57] to this a witness what makes them
[1:18:00] powerful is their influence and then
[1:18:03] your witness is what kind of an
[1:18:04] influence you have on people that's why
[1:18:06] we have to be so careful with one
[1:18:07] another because listen you can murder
[1:18:08] somebody without a pro tonight without
[1:18:10] ever putting a knife in the back you can
[1:18:12] murder their influence hey man so we've
[1:18:14] got to be careful with one another
[1:18:16] because that witness or the influence
[1:18:18] that's part of what God has given them a
[1:18:21] man if I come before you this morning I
[1:18:23] preached and maybe I just preached a
[1:18:24] great sermon I'd like to do that one
[1:18:26] time just preach a great sermon I get
[1:18:29] done I go ahead I start smoking and
[1:18:31] saying every kind of thing in the world
[1:18:32] and this enough you would have no
[1:18:34] confidence in what I was saying
[1:18:36] even if it were true hey man because I
[1:18:41] ruined the witness or my influence now
[1:18:45] listen you've all got influence
[1:18:46] somewhere in your life you've got
[1:18:47] influence over somebody give you a
[1:18:49] witness as a gift for a reason and it's
[1:18:53] not for yourself amen
[1:18:54] people see something in you that's
[1:18:56] different the Roman centurion saw
[1:18:59] something in Jesus that was different
[1:19:02] and I'm bringing myself my second point
[1:19:03] here and he saw that this was a man with
[1:19:06] authority
[1:19:07] now David it says here he was giving us
[1:19:09] up to the other witness the people is as
[1:19:11] a leader not where leaders actually a
[1:19:13] sovereign or somebody it means a ruler
[1:19:16] somebody in a position of authority and
[1:19:18] this is what the Centurion saw in Jesus
[1:19:21] this is what David had him and he didn't
[1:19:23] make himself a king he didn't get a gang
[1:19:26] one day so we're gonna overthrow the
[1:19:28] nation we're gonna rule by by force from
[1:19:30] no God made him a king God gave him
[1:19:33] authority when Jesus come the Roman
[1:19:35] centurion said this is a man with
[1:19:37] authority I recognized it because I
[1:19:40] myself am a man under Authority amen so
[1:19:45] no she notices he has authority because
[1:19:46] he's a man under Authority I want you to
[1:19:48] think about I'm gonna segue here for a
[1:19:50] second I want you to think about this
[1:19:52] Roman centurion because Jesus
[1:19:54] compliments him with a really good
[1:19:55] compliment well the highest praises you
[1:19:58] could ever hear from the Savior ah he
[1:20:00] marveled that this man's great faith in
[1:20:04] men he said I've not seen such great
[1:20:06] faith not at all Israel see the secret
[1:20:10] his great faith was understanding
[1:20:11] Authority hey man he understood
[1:20:16] Authority he said I have men if I tell
[1:20:19] one to go guess what it goes I don't
[1:20:22] have to argue with him I left um six
[1:20:24] times I don't have to ride him up at
[1:20:26] work I don't have to reprimand him and
[1:20:29] off from a bigger race I come to go he
[1:20:32] does it I tell one to come any customs I
[1:20:34] say do this guess what he does you don't
[1:20:36] argue at me you don't fuss with that
[1:20:37] like some of us do wanna somebody like
[1:20:42] some of us do no let's just do something
[1:20:44] right now about that Lord listen if you
[1:20:46] understand Authority you do what you're
[1:20:48] told
[1:20:49] hey man listen if that's if that soldier
[1:20:51] didn't do what he was told he didn't
[1:20:53] just get a slap on the wrist they'd whip
[1:20:54] them or beat him they'd even killed him
[1:20:56] a man and this Roman sentries as I
[1:20:58] understand how authority works because
[1:21:00] I'm a man under Authority now notice we
[1:21:04] all love to have authority for a second
[1:21:09] we all love to wield authority jesus
[1:21:13] said that the Gentiles exercise dominion
[1:21:15] over one another
[1:21:16] we all love to be the boss we all love
[1:21:18] the wheel authority but nobody wants to
[1:21:21] listen to Authority hey man this roman
[1:21:25] centurion said i understand how
[1:21:26] authority works I'm a man under
[1:21:28] Authority these men don't listen to me
[1:21:31] because I'm smarter than them or because
[1:21:33] I'm stronger than them or because of
[1:21:36] whatever cuz I come up there a kind of a
[1:21:37] house they listen to me because I've
[1:21:39] been given a position by the authority
[1:21:42] it's over me unless if you're a son or
[1:21:45] daughter of God the Devils don't listen
[1:21:47] to you this morning because you're
[1:21:48] smarter than them the Devils don't have
[1:21:52] to flee when you command them because
[1:21:54] you're so strong or because you got the
[1:21:56] right kind of an Arsenal in their house
[1:21:57] but because you're under the authority
[1:22:00] of the king of kings and the Lord of
[1:22:02] lords you're a son you're a daughter of
[1:22:04] God amen
[1:22:05] you've been placed in the position of
[1:22:07] authority hey men when I listen if you
[1:22:13] have authority that means you have to
[1:22:14] submit see Authority is submission
[1:22:17] they're the two sides of the same coin
[1:22:18] you can't have authority without
[1:22:20] submission otherwise nobody submits to
[1:22:21] you so notice when a ruler has character
[1:22:26] they don't they don't wield their
[1:22:28] authority like a sword and Karen people
[1:22:31] down I think was Aristotle it was
[1:22:34] Aristotle said that he said he that
[1:22:36] cannot be a good follower cannot be a
[1:22:37] good leader and then let's say I met
[1:22:40] many people they want to run a church
[1:22:42] they want to run your life and they'll
[1:22:43] tell you how to run it to the quick to
[1:22:46] volunteer information about how to run
[1:22:48] your life and they want to tell
[1:22:49] everybody how to run their live and
[1:22:51] they'll tell her but in the church what
[1:22:52] to do and they're all old Hoss ain't
[1:22:53] even in order and they came to submit to
[1:22:55] God they can't sit under a pastor can't
[1:22:58] submit to Authority and I'm thinking why
[1:23:00] do I want to listen to you
[1:23:01] you don't listen
[1:23:03] hey Manuel we gots the fun part of the
[1:23:07] service hey man I mean I know I should
[1:23:14] be careful
[1:23:14] I know preachers like that they won't
[1:23:16] sit under a pastor but they want to
[1:23:17] preach to everybody and what kind of a
[1:23:20] model are you or what are you modeling
[1:23:22] to people if you can't submit to
[1:23:23] Authority
[1:23:24] why do you expect people to submit to
[1:23:26] you well sure hey man well the Apostle
[1:23:30] Paul dealt with that first Corinthians
[1:23:32] 14 verse 37 he said if any man think
[1:23:35] himself to be a prophet or spiritual let
[1:23:38] him acknowledge the things that I write
[1:23:40] unto you are the commandments of the
[1:23:42] Lord him in other words it everybody
[1:23:45] have their own Psalm their own time
[1:23:46] their own do their own their own thing
[1:23:48] and Paul said well that's fine but if
[1:23:51] you're gonna do that you have to
[1:23:52] acknowledge first this is the words of
[1:23:53] Lord I mean you can't come to vindicate
[1:23:56] a promise say well I got a better idea
[1:23:58] no you don't you might have a better
[1:24:01] idea than that man but you don't have a
[1:24:02] better idea than that saith the Lord and
[1:24:05] then people will come and they'll argue
[1:24:07] it's a word and they'll argue with a
[1:24:08] messenger they did the same thing in
[1:24:09] Paul's day and they'll argue with the
[1:24:11] word a little argument promote their
[1:24:13] idea they don't understand Authority
[1:24:16] they don't really have authority because
[1:24:18] they won't submit hey man listen when
[1:24:22] you I might I might share this before
[1:24:25] hey man but listen when you when you
[1:24:27] under my authority you're actually
[1:24:29] undermining your own witness it's true
[1:24:33] amen
[1:24:34] you think about David Luiz David because
[1:24:35] I'm preaching about David you think
[1:24:37] about David when he finds King Saul in a
[1:24:39] cave one day this man is ordained to be
[1:24:42] a king he's been anointed and he's
[1:24:45] wandered and he's fought Philistines
[1:24:47] he's been to Ziklag he's done all this
[1:24:49] and finally here's King Saul the only
[1:24:52] thing that's standing in his way they're
[1:24:54] taking the throne and he finds him
[1:24:56] sleeping in the cave and David has an
[1:24:58] opportunity to slay this man now listen
[1:25:00] this man tried to kill him more than
[1:25:01] once this man's been haunting him like a
[1:25:04] dog and chased him down he got every
[1:25:07] reason
[1:25:08] it's slang this man and he finds me cave
[1:25:11] he says I can't doing shall I touch the
[1:25:15] Lord's anointed him be blameless he said
[1:25:18] when he had yet not brother listen he
[1:25:20] understood that God had kept him in the
[1:25:22] wilderness God had anointed him God had
[1:25:25] preserved him when he fought Goliath
[1:25:27] when he fought the Philistines when he
[1:25:29] wasn't running from Saul he survived he
[1:25:32] overcome because that anointing on his
[1:25:35] life that was what given the power of
[1:25:37] her that's what made him a ruler her
[1:25:39] that's what give him a right to these
[1:25:41] things that anointing on his alive that
[1:25:44] was the only thing that made the
[1:25:45] difference and maybe it wasn't cause he
[1:25:47] was taller than the rest of his brother
[1:25:48] it wasn't all these other things Saul's
[1:25:50] hadn't show his phone everybody else a
[1:25:52] man but that anointing was the only
[1:25:54] thing that made the difference every
[1:25:57] spear and every giant every enemy could
[1:26:00] not overcome an anointing that was the
[1:26:03] power we say this way you know if you're
[1:26:06] talking about books or something hid
[1:26:07] plot armor he's the main character he
[1:26:10] can't die at plot armor then anointing
[1:26:13] kept and I was only the reason he stayed
[1:26:14] alive I'm a man and how I comes to saw
[1:26:17] but this man's also been anointed a lot
[1:26:23] of the groups that that preacher says I
[1:26:24] think he's wrong well he might be they
[1:26:26] still knowing it he's still called and
[1:26:31] you have to be careful I gotta be
[1:26:33] careful at the pulpit
[1:26:34] I don't undermine that guy or his
[1:26:36] influence because the same anointing
[1:26:38] that has me here is the same anointing
[1:26:40] which called him yeah he might be wrong
[1:26:42] at times Saul was wrong still anointed
[1:26:44] still called to be a king is that right
[1:26:46] it's not listen it wasn't David's job to
[1:26:48] get rid of salt God take care of that if
[1:26:50] he asked - hey man - under to come
[1:26:53] against Saul is to come against the very
[1:26:55] anointing that kept him alive it would
[1:26:59] be he would be under a be saying
[1:27:01] annoying was good enough for me but not
[1:27:02] for soft
[1:27:03] hey man he would be undermining the very
[1:27:06] authority that kept him it's powerful
[1:27:10] hey man praise the Lord I believe I
[1:27:14] believe or the RAM was that kind of a
[1:27:16] man a man
[1:27:16] he was sitting as a the Bible I'm sorry
[1:27:19] the Bible says that David was sent as a
[1:27:21] leader is that right brother brain one
[1:27:23] goes beyond the curtain of time the
[1:27:24] voice is speaking to him and he sees the
[1:27:26] people that are gathered and he said
[1:27:27] that you were sent to the earth to be a
[1:27:29] leader hey man I believe that man was
[1:27:32] anointed for that message a man I
[1:27:34] believe he's a seventh angel in the
[1:27:36] seventh Church age
[1:27:37] hey man he's more than just the teacher
[1:27:39] to me he's more than just a good Bible
[1:27:42] scholar look that's what so many people
[1:27:44] they look at this prophet that's why
[1:27:46] they argue with the word that's why the
[1:27:48] fight was a message because brother bran
[1:27:49] is just another man to them but to me I
[1:27:52] recognize that the anointing in his life
[1:27:54] that's the same anointing that's kept me
[1:27:56] that's kept you that's brought us here
[1:27:58] today and Who am I to speak against it
[1:28:02] Who am I to come against it well that's
[1:28:04] the very power that brought us here amen
[1:28:07] I think about that he's more than just a
[1:28:11] man he's a leader is that right
[1:28:15] so we have authorities all right we have
[1:28:17] a witness you know let me say it this
[1:28:19] way
[1:28:20] taught my undermining Authority if I go
[1:28:21] home and somebody my pastor preaches and
[1:28:24] every time he preaches I go home and I
[1:28:26] find something wrong I tell my wife and
[1:28:28] I tell my kids man he don't know what
[1:28:30] he's talking about
[1:28:31] I don't do this he don't know what he's
[1:28:33] talking about he's wrong list now after

[1:32:20] I want to talk about this last part here
[1:32:24] I like this he says give us a witness a
[1:32:28] leader and a commander to the people
[1:32:30] it's word for commander in the Hebrews
[1:32:32] actually a verb it's one who gives
[1:32:33] commands it seems kind of pedantic but
[1:32:36] it's actually what he's saying is it's
[1:32:38] someone who makes effectual commands a
[1:32:41] man it's a verb to someone who gives
[1:32:43] commands so an effective leader they
[1:32:45] have have influence they're a ruler they
[1:32:48] have authority you have Authority in
[1:32:49] your life you have influence but there's
[1:32:50] something else and I think many times
[1:32:53] this remote many of us fail amen he
[1:32:55] gives clear commands where he issues
[1:32:58] commands to the people amen
[1:33:00] so an effective ruler knows how to give
[1:33:02] direction that's what it is amen
[1:33:05] many times we're guilty of coming to
[1:33:08] church come to church and we'll warm up
[1:33:11] you will pray maybe we're doing all the
[1:33:13] right things but somewhere in our life
[1:33:15] we lost our ambition somewhere my life
[1:33:18] we lost our direction and we're just
[1:33:19] kind of floating through life hoping to
[1:33:21] make it by but a real leader a real
[1:33:23] ruler me and my home I have a
[1:33:25] having ambitions for my family for my
[1:33:27] children you know I got one he wants to
[1:33:30] go to space
[1:33:30] well well I'm gonna surpass that anyway
[1:33:34] Hey they have different dreams I have
[1:33:37] different ambitions they they do
[1:33:38] different things when in school
[1:33:40] differently amen that's not good and
[1:33:42] fine and whether they're well I won't
[1:33:45] want to be a doctor I mean a mechanic
[1:33:47] and need a lawyer there's somebody do my
[1:33:49] hair yeah then I'm set for life amen but
[1:33:53] what do they do that or whether they
[1:33:55] flip burgers or whatever happens a lot
[1:33:57] I've got one ambition for them that's
[1:33:59] more important than all those things I
[1:34:00] want them to be Christians I don't want
[1:34:04] them to live off my testimony I don't
[1:34:06] want just to go to church I want them to
[1:34:08] meet the same God
[1:34:10] then I'll mind on them sacred Satan's
[1:34:13] listen it's not always easy I'll give a
[1:34:17] testimony huh actually I've never I've
[1:34:19] never preached this before money give it
[1:34:20] here ma my one daughter she come up one
[1:34:22] time at an altar service I was preaching
[1:34:24] and she got down she started praying and
[1:34:26] God was just really deal with her I'm
[1:34:28] telling this for a reason I hope you
[1:34:29] catch this amen I don't claim to be an
[1:34:31] expert parent but this is just just me
[1:34:33] amen and she's down there praying and I
[1:34:35] went and I prayed with her and I almost
[1:34:37] stopped I said there there sweetheart
[1:34:40] now you don't have to cry more it's okay
[1:34:41] I stopped myself I stopped myself you
[1:34:46] know why because I realize not just
[1:34:47] about question Spirit of God God's deal
[1:34:49] with her and maybe she's going through
[1:34:51] things and God's trying to work in her
[1:34:53] life and if we're not careful we try to
[1:34:55] make their life easier for him we try to
[1:34:57] comfort them and we try to give them
[1:34:58] consolation and if we're not careful we
[1:35:00] let that take the place of the Holy
[1:35:02] Ghost being their counselor and the Holy
[1:35:04] Ghost given their comfort if we're not
[1:35:06] careful we'll do that I will rob her of
[1:35:08] that experience with my gnats you see
[1:35:11] philia loves one thing but a golf he
[1:35:13] loves a whole nother thing God let you
[1:35:15] go through trials gotta let you go
[1:35:18] through things he'll let you maybe just
[1:35:20] sweat it out sometimes and you think I
[1:35:22] always got to help me out maybe he's
[1:35:23] trying to get you somewhere maybe is
[1:35:25] trying to restore your sense of
[1:35:26] direction and then because it's not just
[1:35:29] given directions given the right kind
[1:35:30] interaction and sometimes God's got to
[1:35:32] get a hold of our attention and then
[1:35:35] that would have been the wrongs I
[1:35:36] I had to go and sit down cuz I watched
[1:35:38] filial love trying to take its place and
[1:35:40] know God's dealing with her and then as
[1:35:43] parents we've got to be careful what
[1:35:45] kind of a vision we put before our
[1:35:46] children amen
[1:35:47] hey man the Bible tells us that you know
[1:35:51] you know we look at Abraham and Abraham
[1:35:52] was chosen not because his people were
[1:35:55] the greatest people the Bible says even
[1:35:56] the weakest of all people do you know
[1:35:59] why God chose Abraham from all the
[1:36:01] people of the earth the Bible tells you
[1:36:02] why
[1:36:03] Genesis chapter 18 it says shall I hide
[1:36:05] from Abraham the thing which I do seem
[1:36:07] that Abraham shall surely become a great
[1:36:09] and mighty nation and all the nations of
[1:36:12] the earth shall be blessed in him watch
[1:36:14] this verse 19 for I know him that he
[1:36:16] will command his children and his
[1:36:19] household after him and they shall keep
[1:36:22] the way of the Lord to do justice and
[1:36:26] judgment why let the Lord may bring upon
[1:36:29] Abraham that what she has spoken of him
[1:36:32] God knew if I give Abraham a vision if I
[1:36:35] give him a direction he'll instruct his
[1:36:37] children he'll teach his children he'll
[1:36:40] train his household after him
[1:36:41] you said I don't know how well he did
[1:36:43] well let me tell you what he did when
[1:36:44] they well his wife Sarah died he went
[1:36:46] down and bought a field and the plains
[1:36:48] of Mamre bought a pot of land from the
[1:36:50] sons of Heth and he went and bought a
[1:36:52] place to bury her because he'd seen
[1:36:53] something he'd seen something that the
[1:36:56] Lord was gonna raise up a people one day
[1:36:58] there was gonna be a resurrection he saw
[1:37:01] taking place hey man so he goes he puts
[1:37:04] his wife in that field and his children
[1:37:06] after him go there and when Jacobs down
[1:37:08] in Egypt he said my children all kinds
[1:37:12] of darkness if you trade a child the way
[1:37:14] that they should go they'll not richer
[1:37:15] don't come up right amen
[1:37:18] he'll not depart when he's older your
[1:37:21] child might be in Egypt right now ha ha
[1:37:24] but there was something in Jacobs life
[1:37:26] through all this betrayal and all the
[1:37:28] nonsenses in his life there was
[1:37:30] something anybody was down there in
[1:37:32] Egypt so don't bury me down there
[1:37:34] how are they back where the resurrection
[1:37:38] we're gonna be when Joseph's getting
[1:37:39] ready to die
[1:37:41] he'd been instructed don't leave me down
[1:37:44] here you'll be here
[1:37:46] years but when you come up don't leave
[1:37:49] my bones down here in Egypt I savor him
[1:37:54] did a pretty good job they knew so much
[1:37:57] about her one to carry his dead bones
[1:37:58] cliff you're a promise through a woman's
[1:38:00] the promised land a man a hip her hair
[1:38:04] have instructed them hey man they knew
[1:38:06] there was a right place to be buried you
[1:38:08] know let's talk about Moses earlier I
[1:38:10] had this thought here just a few months
[1:38:12] ago Moses the age of 40 he goes to
[1:38:15] deliver the people of God and bring him
[1:38:17] out of Egypt and take him there with
[1:38:19] justice bones and all and he goes to do
[1:38:22] that when of course we know the story he
[1:38:23] fails and I thought to myself when I
[1:38:25] said what if he had succeeded what if at
[1:38:28] the age of 40
[1:38:29] he'd overthrown the Egyptians and
[1:38:31] grabbed all them people and he walked on
[1:38:33] the wilderness where was he gonna go
[1:38:38] he'd never been to the promised land he
[1:38:41] he didn't have a map he didn't have a
[1:38:44] compass or an asteroid what was he gonna
[1:38:46] do and then see he had to meet the
[1:38:48] burning bush first because that fire was
[1:38:51] what was gonna lead him to the promised
[1:38:53] land that's why we've got to meet that
[1:38:55] burning bush we can have all kinds of
[1:38:57] ideas we can make a bigger building we
[1:39:00] can get more people who without the Holy
[1:39:02] Ghost to lead us in the right direction
[1:39:04] how can we give the people the right
[1:39:06] direction
[1:39:08] many times as I said many times as
[1:39:10] leaders that's where we fail we fail to
[1:39:12] put a vision before the people this is
[1:39:14] what God wants for you without a vision
[1:39:17] the people perish hey man
[1:39:20] without a vision becomes an uncertain
[1:39:23] sounds I write with a if a trumpet gives
[1:39:25] uncertain sound if I'm up here and I say
[1:39:27] well God's real day is not the next I
[1:39:29] believe the message I don't that's it
[1:39:31] how can that take you anywhere
[1:39:32] that's an uncertain sound name ahead who
[1:39:35] how you gonna get ready for the battle
[1:39:38] hey listen it's the job of a leader you
[1:39:42] think about David when he was down there
[1:39:44] in cyclic David I'm talking about David
[1:39:46] this mornin a man when he's down there
[1:39:48] he's Ziklag
[1:39:49] and all them people come against him and
[1:39:51] then that feels she's had come they
[1:39:53] taking his wives they taking his
[1:39:55] children they taking all these things
[1:39:56] from him there wasn't one person that
[1:39:59] camp that was on David's side
[1:40:00] they all got mad at David and said you
[1:40:02] know what you let us down David and the
[1:40:05] Bible says he was greatly distressed
[1:40:06] because they took up stones well he
[1:40:10] didn't know he was preaching that Sunday
[1:40:11] the whole congregation was packing a
[1:40:12] bunch of stones man David you don't
[1:40:14] messed up we're gonna get you now David
[1:40:17] I knew you'd let us down he didn't know
[1:40:21] one person back him up but the Bible
[1:40:23] says he began to encouraged himself in
[1:40:26] the Lord bless the Lord O my soul and
[1:40:29] know that's within me bless His Holy
[1:40:31] Name bless the Lord O my soul and forget
[1:40:33] not all his benefits who forgiveth all
[1:40:36] thine iniquities who redeemeth thy lap
[1:40:38] with loving-kindness who healeth all
[1:40:40] that he began encouraged himself like he
[1:40:42] did there that day with song cuz it's
[1:40:46] his job he's the leader he's the one
[1:40:49] that's got to give them a direction when
[1:40:51] everybody else is discouraged how many
[1:40:53] times you come in here maybe you were
[1:40:55] discouraged
[1:40:55] maybe you're just so distraught listen
[1:40:58] well praise the Lord we all deal with
[1:40:59] discouragement you can admit it
[1:41:01] maybe you come in here so discouraged
[1:41:03] maybe maybe so defeated feeling as a
[1:41:05] Christian and the pastor get up and he
[1:41:07] began to preach something and before you
[1:41:08] know you hear your visions been restored
[1:41:11] and maybe that's what the devil wants to
[1:41:13] take from you first is your vision just
[1:41:14] like he did with Sampson a man he wants
[1:41:16] to take that vision listen if you're
[1:41:18] just going to work to make them living
[1:41:20] amen if you're just coming to church to
[1:41:22] be seen of people that's not gonna hold
[1:41:25] you but when but when the enemy is
[1:41:27] coming against you and your wife is gone
[1:41:30] your children are going everybody
[1:41:31] speaking
[1:41:32] yes you that's when it's the time to
[1:41:34] remember you super God you belong to a
[1:41:37] kingdom that cannot be moved it's
[1:41:40] greater him impulsive that none of these
[1:41:42] things move me
[1:41:43] he caught a hold of something he had a
[1:41:46] vision of a kingdom
[1:41:48] hallelujah some money he said Oh death
[1:41:51] where is lasting I'm persuaded there's
[1:41:58] nothing that can separate us from the
[1:42:00] love of God the man says this he says
[1:42:08] you know leaders sometimes got some
[1:42:10] leaders here this morning I believe him
[1:42:12] huh maybe you don't have an office or
[1:42:14] position but you got some leaders here
[1:42:16] this is you know leaders sometimes go
[1:42:19] through things that the congregation
[1:42:20] don't know what they're going through
[1:42:22] you pray for your pastor when you think
[1:42:25] of the promises God has made and why
[1:42:27] don't it come to pass they don't tell
[1:42:29] their congregation they don't tell the
[1:42:31] people they associate with but there's
[1:42:33] many frustrations in the heart of a real
[1:42:35] leader I believe David knew what that
[1:42:36] was like he says many times we're forced
[1:42:39] to do things and say things that we
[1:42:42] don't want to say in a real spiritual
[1:42:44] leader he's forced to do it he has to
[1:42:47] take his side and show his colors I'll
[1:42:50] take the way with the Lord's despise for
[1:42:52] you hey man brother Graham says they're
[1:42:57] same ham but listen I think this is I
[1:43:01] think it's important amen because like I
[1:43:05] said we're going through things and many
[1:43:07] times we're like that we there's some
[1:43:09] things you just can't tell people hey
[1:43:11] man there's just some things you just
[1:43:12] have to hide in your heart sometimes you
[1:43:14] got questions amen and that's the time
[1:43:17] to remember the vision that you're
[1:43:19] serving amen we're going to a future
[1:43:22] home we're going somewhere amen
[1:43:25] this isn't where it ends this isn't
[1:43:29] where it stops this isn't all it's meant
[1:43:31] to be the best these aren't just behind
[1:43:33] us we're going somewhere we're going to
[1:43:36] the promised land we're going to a land
[1:43:38] that flows with milk and honey
[1:43:43] sometimes we get discouraged even
[1:43:45] brother ben says this ever-present water
[1:43:46] from the rock he says I'm he says I'm
[1:43:48] supposed to they very odd person to many
[1:43:51] people
[1:43:51] he says I'm kind of odd to myself
[1:43:53] although I feel good about that he says
[1:43:57] because I tried to follow the leading of
[1:43:59] the Holy Spirit just as close as I can
[1:44:00] and that makes us odd see we do things
[1:44:04] that we sit down and we wonder sometimes
[1:44:07] why did I do such a thing
[1:44:09] I could sit there all day I've done that
[1:44:17] in my life before where it was a mistake
[1:44:19] I'm talking about when you know this God
[1:44:21] spoke to you why did I do such thing how
[1:44:23] did I ever do that and right then you
[1:44:25] may think you've done exactly what you
[1:44:28] should not have done but if you'll just
[1:44:30] be patient have faith and you're sure
[1:44:32] that God has led you to do it you'll
[1:44:34] find out it works just exactly right and
[1:44:36] many times we find that he says I know
[1:44:38] brother Neville has fought many times
[1:44:40] leaders and spiritual people realize
[1:44:42] that and then sometimes God will put you
[1:44:46] in the thick of it
[1:44:48] man and you you might I think I told my
[1:44:51] testimony when I when I was working in
[1:44:53] the factory and I quit to go overseas I
[1:44:55] went not I'd prayed about because I was
[1:44:57] quitting my job to have any prospects
[1:44:58] and I handed my resignation in I put my
[1:45:01] foot like three weeks they were actually
[1:45:02] shocked because everybody just walks out
[1:45:04] I put my two weeks in I knew God spoke
[1:45:07] to me and I hand that in and they tried
[1:45:09] to stop me I said no the Lord has called
[1:45:10] me to go such in such a place I walked
[1:45:13] out of there ten foot tall I'll be
[1:45:14] honest with you the next day I didn't
[1:45:16] feel that way next day I woke up and I
[1:45:18] was at home and said I just quit my job
[1:45:20] I've got nothing lined up when I come
[1:45:21] home what an idiot I'll tell you I'm
[1:45:25] counting how much money's in the bag
[1:45:27] trying to figure it out I'm like man I
[1:45:28] don't even know how many make it by the
[1:45:29] first month on your back didn't even
[1:45:31] know what I was gonna do and I'll be
[1:45:33] real honest with y'all just just between
[1:45:35] you me I felt like the biggest in the
[1:45:37] world
[1:45:37] I thought about go man officer problem
[1:45:40] from a job I'm still here let me stay
[1:45:43] hey man I didn't know he's feeling I got
[1:45:47] some frustrations but yet I knew that
[1:45:49] God spoke to me and right
[1:45:51] um it seemed like the biggest mistake of
[1:45:53] my life
[1:45:55] well my wife and kids are gonna start
[1:45:57] well as you can tell I didn't starve
[1:45:59] maybe I could have burnt a star a little
[1:46:01] bit more a man but I've never seen the
[1:46:03] righteous forsaken I've never seen a
[1:46:05] seed begging bread he was faithful I'm a
[1:46:08] witness
[1:46:09] hey man mom you think about that
[1:46:13] sometimes we get in the thick of it we
[1:46:15] think we made the biggest mistake the
[1:46:17] one God's got you exactly where he wants
[1:46:18] you god that's exactly what I want say
[1:46:21] man we've got to stand up to the enemy
[1:46:23] when nobody else wants to do it amen
[1:46:26] oh yeah I think I think they say that
[1:46:29] 90% of people do or 10% people do 90% of
[1:46:32] the work the most jobs anyhow that's
[1:46:34] about the truth of it amen somewhere in
[1:46:36] our life we've got to own up and be a
[1:46:38] real leader in a home whether it's your
[1:46:41] children your wife whatever it is amen
[1:46:43] we can't wait for somebody else to do an
[1:46:45] amen well that's where I come to my my
[1:46:48] finale here ain't man I was praying one
[1:46:54] time this is a few months back the Lord
[1:46:56] woke me up in the middle of night I was
[1:46:57] getting ready to preach somewhere and I
[1:46:58] woke up Sunday morning two o'clock in
[1:47:00] the morning and God was dealing me about
[1:47:02] Shammi our brother Ian preached about
[1:47:03] sharing guard and even preach it that
[1:47:04] day but I was just telling me about this
[1:47:06] and I was thinking about Shamgar
[1:47:08] you know we talked about this man
[1:47:09] there's one word in the Bible another
[1:47:10] brim heap dramatizes this one scripture
[1:47:12] on the Bible here's a man a judge of
[1:47:14] Israel and he's been called for a
[1:47:16] purpose amen
[1:47:17] you know it's funny cuz we read these
[1:47:19] stories in the Bible like the newspaper
[1:47:20] some time we don't always think about
[1:47:23] the backstory there and I thought about
[1:47:25] Shamgar I thought about myself as a
[1:47:26] young man oh you know when I first got
[1:47:28] married
[1:47:28] I met the girl my dreams and I had I had
[1:47:30] everything and I was just thinking about
[1:47:32] how you know we know things don't always
[1:47:34] end the way they start out and that's
[1:47:36] where we lose our vision sometimes and I
[1:47:38] was thinking about Shamgar he'd probably
[1:47:39] been raised in a farm
[1:47:40] taking care of the oxen and he meets the
[1:47:42] girl of his dreams hey man and they
[1:47:44] decide to get married one day and his
[1:47:46] family gives them big old shiny rocks
[1:47:48] gold for his wedding gift and he's out
[1:47:50] there moving the oxen and he's got he's
[1:47:52] a strapping young man and that's her
