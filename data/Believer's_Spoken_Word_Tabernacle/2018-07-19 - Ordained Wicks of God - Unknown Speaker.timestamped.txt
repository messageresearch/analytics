[35:00] amen amen
[35:04] may your loving tonight a man it's good
[35:08] to be a Christian let's go in our
[35:11] scriptures here in our Bibles to Isaiah
[35:13] chapter 60 verse 1 Isaiah chapter 60
[35:23] verse 1
[35:39] arise shine for thy light is come and
[35:47] the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee
[35:53] well behold the darkness shall cover the
[35:56] earth and gross darkness the people but
[36:00] the Lord shall arise upon thee and his
[36:03] glory shall be seen upon thee and the
[36:08] Gentiles shall come to thy light and
[36:09] Kings to the brightness of thy rising
[36:14] amen may God bless His Word and bless
[36:17] you as you're being seated it's a very
[36:23] familiar passage of Scripture and I
[36:27] trust it is but I trust it's not common
[36:30] to our hearts and you look at the words
[36:33] and how that the Holy Spirit were just
[36:36] so quick and the words to our hearts and
[36:39] the find of how that were spoken to
[36:43] within this within the scriptures to
[36:46] arise and shine and we know that it has
[36:51] to be that without without there being
[36:54] light to come there had to be something
[36:59] that could actually be illuminated
[37:01] something that could be brought to light
[37:04] and when we think of that we know that
[37:08] it is very personal our light has come
[37:10] just like God has visited every
[37:13] generation every age and God his word is
[37:17] what is light when God makes that word
[37:19] become light it becomes a reality and
[37:22] the purpose of that is to bring seeds is
[37:26] to bring life to his children that are
[37:29] here and ordained within this present
[37:32] time as it has been within every time so
[37:36] if there is the command that is given to
[37:38] arise and shine then it speaks that
[37:41] there must be material lives that can be
[37:45] yielded to be able to reflect because
[37:48] there's there's no other true light but
[37:51] him
[37:52] there's no other light that we are to
[37:55] reflect but him we're not to reflect you
[37:59] know as it were a church or a program
[38:02] yet our lives do reflect upon what upon
[38:06] this assembly is brother band will tell
[38:07] us and many times you'll speak of how
[38:10] that you know there were those within
[38:11] that community they went out and they
[38:13] ran up garage bills and different things
[38:15] like that and the brem said we went out
[38:18] and we took care of that so that it
[38:19] would not be such a reflection upon the
[38:22] church but we realize that the shining
[38:24] of this light and the reflection of it
[38:27] that there is a call to reflect the very
[38:30] life of the Lord Jesus Christ and that's
[38:33] that's really the desire that burns
[38:35] within our hearts we want to see him
[38:37] reflected and glorified in our lives in
[38:40] every way we want to see him on display
[38:42] and and if God is called for this and
[38:45] this word has laid here then it shows
[38:48] that God knows just like within every
[38:50] bed of time what is laying here and the
[38:53] material that he already has placed here
[38:56] in order for him by his presence to
[38:59] illuminate that material and bring it to
[39:02] life to reflect him in this hour so when
[39:05] we we look at this here you know it's
[39:08] much like when you think of it when
[39:10] Moses here you look at how that in Moses
[39:13] life when Moses when he had went up into
[39:16] the the mountain to receive the
[39:18] commandments of the Lord the Bible says
[39:20] when he came out of the presence of God
[39:22] that his face shone and you know that
[39:25] was an experience of how that Moses had
[39:28] come into the presence of God and he had
[39:31] been illuminated with the very word that
[39:34] God had for that time to be given out
[39:36] and then you you think you moved from
[39:38] that time and you moved to where you see
[39:41] Stephen when he's coming to a place to
[39:43] where his life has also been illuminated
[39:46] by the presence of God and the scripture
[39:49] would declare and record his countenance
[39:52] was as like that of a angel that shine
[39:55] it and and we look at it that the soul
[39:57] that this was God's desire that it would
[40:00] be by his word coming in and being
[40:03] livered and you know amazing Moses face
[40:06] would have never shown had it not been
[40:08] that Moses was ordained for that he was
[40:12] called into that place and he was also
[40:15] receptive you see all of those parts
[40:17] were working together so that it was
[40:20] God's light that was made to reflect if
[40:23] there's nothing within a person to
[40:26] reflect they cannot reflect light if
[40:28] it's not in a person to be able to
[40:31] receive light they can never receive
[40:33] that but if there's something that is
[40:35] within a person it is certainly not
[40:38] something that man has put there or that
[40:41] we have read ourselves to a place of it
[40:43] but it's what God has already ordained
[40:46] and it's God that brings it into a place
[40:49] to where that he himself can begin to
[40:52] take that part that's ordained by him
[40:54] that material that which he is placed
[40:57] there and he himself can begin to
[40:59] reflect his own life through that so
[41:03] when we we think of this within that
[41:05] scripture of how that you see Stephens
[41:07] life of how that his countenance was
[41:10] shining within that time and and the
[41:12] glory of God was was being made meant
[41:15] made manifest in his life and certainly
[41:17] the glory of God when we look at this
[41:19] scripture right here that is displayed
[41:22] here before us we see the condition that
[41:25] the world is in we see that condition
[41:28] and it's such a stark contrast as a
[41:30] matter of fact the darkness that is upon
[41:32] the world is not something that has come
[41:35] just all of a sudden but remember it has
[41:37] been seeds that was planted before
[41:39] that's now coming into a place of
[41:42] maturity but the same way holds true for
[41:45] the light upon the believer it has been
[41:48] seeds that have been planted and now
[41:50] those seeds are coming into fruition for
[41:53] whatever has been planted will be reaped
[41:57] is that right so now when we look at
[42:00] this and then thinking of this in the
[42:02] scripture I just want to take this
[42:04] thought just here tonight just a little
[42:06] bit and ask that the Lord will just help
[42:08] us here on ordained
[42:10] wicks of god-ordained wicks of God and I
[42:14] look at here in the scripture of
[42:16] Colossians 1 verse 12 Paul says giving
[42:19] thanks under the Father which hath made
[42:21] us meet to be partakers of the
[42:25] inheritance of the Saints in light who
[42:28] had delivered us from the power of
[42:30] darkness and hath translated us into the
[42:33] kingdom of his dear son he hath made us
[42:37] to be partakers of the inheritance and
[42:40] that that inheritance is is that of his
[42:44] own life this life that you and I have
[42:46] been made partakers up we understand
[42:49] it's not a church life this is not
[42:52] religion it's Christ's own life it's the
[42:56] Holy Ghost you and I have been made
[42:58] partakers of it to be made in the word
[43:01] made us to be fit we were not fit within
[43:04] ourselves we could not bring ourselves
[43:06] to our inheritance but God Himself
[43:09] become one of us and through the very
[43:12] offering up of the Lord Jesus we are
[43:15] brought back to our inheritance that we
[43:18] had in God from the beginning is that
[43:22] right but there has to be now when there
[43:24] is an inheritance you'll never know what
[43:27] rightfully belongs to you unless there's
[43:29] someone that can be Clare to you what it
[43:32] is that belongs to you but you've also
[43:35] got to be able to recognize that you're
[43:38] the one that is included in the writing
[43:40] and you've got to be able to recognize
[43:42] that to say what is being spoken that's
[43:45] for me now there might be others that
[43:47] will look at it and listen to it and it
[43:50] will never have a meaning to them but
[43:52] upon your heart upon my heart there's
[43:54] something about the word when it's
[43:56] spoken in this time in this hour it has
[44:00] an effect upon our life because it is
[44:02] our inheritance and to think that the
[44:05] Lord Jesus Christ he comes down and
[44:07] through those processes of bringing us
[44:10] to himself he calls us by faith is that
[44:13] right he sanctifies our life there's a
[44:17] cleansing of the blood hits a reading
[44:19] out of all the old habits and setting
[44:21] our mind and holding us and then he
[44:23] himself alone can come and step down and
[44:26] sit down to the midst of our life
[44:28] bringing us into that place
[44:32] think of this an inheritance of the
[44:35] saints that are in life every one that
[44:38] has walked where you and I are walking
[44:41] by God's grace Peter walk the same way
[44:44] Paul walk the same way that they were
[44:46] partakers of the same inheritance as a
[44:49] matter of fact Peter called it partakers
[44:52] of that divine nature so when we look at
[44:55] how that God has set forth here and we
[44:58] look at how that God has ordained for
[45:00] this moment I want to move over in the
[45:03] Book of Revelations and we know that the
[45:06] Book of Revelations itself it's a symbol
[45:08] there's many things throughout the
[45:10] scripture that are given as symbols
[45:13] there's ways how God Himself is even he
[45:16] wrote his Bible in the heavens you'll
[45:17] find Amos where Amos will be moved by
[45:20] the Spirit of God and he will tell the
[45:22] people of God seek after that of the
[45:24] seven stars and that of Orion God then
[45:27] writing it in the heavens and how that
[45:29] God was declaring even here within
[45:32] symbols of what had been down through
[45:35] the Old Testament and many of the old
[45:37] prophets have seen which we had spoke of
[45:40] here just some months ago but notice in
[45:42] verse 19 he says write the things which
[45:46] thou has seen and the things which are
[45:48] and the things which shall be Hereafter
[45:50] the mystery of the Seven Stars which
[45:53] thou sawest in my right hand and the
[45:57] Seven golden candlesticks the seven
[46:00] stars are the angels of the seven
[46:03] churches and the seven candlesticks
[46:05] which thou sawest are the seven churches
[46:09] if you remove the star you have no
[46:14] illumination to come to that church is
[46:17] that right a star himself is that which
[46:20] is in the right hand of God
[46:22] and it's set forth by God to that
[46:26] as is mentioned in each one of the
[46:28] letters down through of that in the Book
[46:31] of Revelations I don't mean to be
[46:33] redundant but I know that some of this
[46:35] might be new but to recognize that God
[46:37] from this time of the sacrificial the
[46:41] offering and the Ascension up to think
[46:43] of how that God has reserved within this
[46:46] time what was in his mind that he would
[46:48] call a Gentile bride he would call his
[46:53] people that which he has has already
[46:55] chosen before the foundation of the
[46:57] world and how that God has given their
[47:00] of the space of time that he himself by
[47:02] and through the Holy Spirit working to
[47:05] call his children unto himself and God
[47:08] has a program and his program it can't
[47:11] go outside of his program he hasn't he
[47:14] has a distinct program God if we want
[47:17] for rate within God's program then we
[47:19] received the true blessing of God
[47:21] because God is the one that puts his
[47:24] program over oh my and I look at how
[47:28] that this is his spoken of here within
[47:31] the Scriptures and brother Ron takes it
[47:33] like this in the Patmos vision and he
[47:35] says how thrilling it is to think of
[47:38] those seven lamps drawing life and light
[47:41] from the resources of that main bowl
[47:45] because they had their wicks dipped
[47:48] there in the thick of this that ball it
[47:52] was one ball that was poured into that
[47:54] one ball that was on top of the
[47:57] candlestick it says and that ball was
[48:00] filled with that oil after the very
[48:02] Ascension of the Lord Jesus Christ I had
[48:05] priests the Holy Spirit was poured back
[48:08] out it was poured out upon the Church of
[48:11] the Living God it was no longer just as
[48:13] David would know the Spirit of God and
[48:15] the prophets of old would know the
[48:18] Spirit of God moving on their life then
[48:19] pulling back moving upon their life then
[48:22] pulling back but the Lord Jesus himself
[48:24] was the first of this new race upon whom
[48:27] thou shalt see the Spirit descend and
[48:30] remained this same is he and this is
[48:33] exactly what would take place for every
[48:37] Jose and son and daughter of God where
[48:39] the Spirit of God descending and
[48:42] remaining by a real true new birth to
[48:46] think of this and this manner he poured
[48:48] out of his of his life and it goes on to
[48:52] say each church age Messenger is
[48:55] depicted here his life is on fire with
[48:59] the Holy Ghost his wit his life has been
[49:02] immersed in Christ through that wick he
[49:07] is drawing the very life of Christ and
[49:10] by it gives out light to the church what
[49:13] kind of a light is he giving the very
[49:16] same light that was in the first lamp
[49:18] that was lit and right on down the ages
[49:21] to the present time of the last day
[49:23] messenger the same life and the same
[49:26] light is manifested by a life that is
[49:30] hid with Christ in God now I want you to
[49:34] think of this this word through that
[49:36] wick he is drawing the very life of
[49:39] Christ and I want you just to think
[49:43] about I know it's a simple but just to
[49:45] think up on it just for a little bit
[49:47] because you see within our lives when
[49:50] we've been looking at the seven golden
[49:52] candlesticks and we've seen how that God
[49:54] placed it out there in a type in the
[49:57] tabernacle then we move over and we see
[49:59] it all the way down the old testament
[50:01] and into the new testament where it
[50:03] speaks that no man lied at the candle
[50:06] and then hide it under a bushel but he
[50:08] put a fit on a candlestick so there's a
[50:11] placement but to recognize God that God
[50:14] the God's whole working it's not that
[50:17] our life is concealed here within just
[50:20] these walls of this church that's not
[50:23] the goal is that it's it's easy let me
[50:26] say it like this it's easy and here to
[50:28] feel good or or to if we could say like
[50:31] this it'd be easy to live and maybe you
[50:33] know in a way of victory but this is not
[50:35] where God intends just for that life to
[50:39] be displayed but the Bible when he came
[50:41] down and he lit them candles or those
[50:44] wicks on the day of Pentecost remember
[50:46] he said you're to be witnesses on
[50:49] to me unto the uttermost parts of Judea
[50:54] Samaria
[50:55] beginning in Jerusalem so to where the
[50:57] Holy Spirit to think of this oh my of
[51:00] how that the Holy Ghost now in control
[51:03] of the Church of the Living God and how
[51:06] that God would take and guide and direct
[51:09] a Philip he would guide and direct
[51:11] different ones into places even to the
[51:13] place where Peter could open up and
[51:15] riding in the first part 1st Peter
[51:18] chapter 1 Peter an apostle and servant
[51:21] of God unto the elect saints of God into
[51:24] Cappadocia and all the way on through it
[51:27] was those who were elect and ordained of
[51:30] God and he said I've sent and I've come
[51:32] with this purpose in mind oh my I just
[51:36] you know and I think of it these wicks
[51:38] that are that are laid out here the wick
[51:40] itself is that predestinated seat of God
[51:43] it's predestinated of God you know you
[51:48] can't just make anything a wick not just
[51:51] anything will be a wick but there are
[51:54] certain materials that are ordained to
[51:58] be wicks there's certain things you know
[52:01] as it would be you can actually take a
[52:04] mop and you can take a mop and you can
[52:07] cut that mop and you can take that
[52:08] string when it better of cotton and you
[52:11] can actually take that and dip that one
[52:13] in an oil and let it sit in there in
[52:15] those old lamps you can set it there and
[52:17] let it be fed right up and it will not
[52:20] that string will not burn up but it
[52:23] actually has the ability within that
[52:26] string to bring up the oil and the fire
[52:30] itself is burning from the oil traveling
[52:33] through the wick glory be to God now to
[52:38] think of this of how these wicks and
[52:40] ordained and to look at it you find that
[52:43] how that God had each one of these men
[52:47] these seven stars that we're looking at
[52:49] it seven messengers and I want to kind
[52:51] of go back and forth in a reflection to
[52:53] just look at this tonight in comparison
[52:55] to our own lives
[52:56] it's ordained that wick when we look at
[52:59] that wick of God it is or day
[53:02] to draw from the very life of God
[53:05] through predestinated fibers that his
[53:09] life might be made manifest it's not
[53:12] it's not of who we are or who we've made
[53:15] ourselves but it is God's grace and
[53:18] here's working and what you think of
[53:21] this you were made you know there's a
[53:23] lot of things that you know that we said
[53:25] the oil you could have the oil but if
[53:27] they're said but if there's not the
[53:29] right material to absorb it it'll never
[53:31] do any good but there's got to be
[53:33] material that can absorb and you see a
[53:37] lot of with the preaching of the word
[53:39] the flow of the Holy Spirit it can there
[53:42] are some that are made to repel it but
[53:44] there are other hearts and lies that are
[53:47] made to absorb the working of the Holy
[53:50] Spirit that are made to absorb when God
[53:53] is expecting and expressing in that hour
[53:56] and it's something personal
[53:58] to our hearts that it's not something
[54:00] that we have done but it's ordained to
[54:03] it and it's absorbing right down on our
[54:05] fiber not even what sometimes you don't
[54:07] even feel it
[54:08] but it's being absorbed it's being
[54:10] absorbed sometimes you don't even
[54:12] recognize the absorption why because
[54:15] it's just simply part of who you are it
[54:19] absorbs through your life sometimes the
[54:22] manifestation of that you don't see it
[54:24] to some part on down the line oh my may
[54:27] God help us to ever abide within the oil
[54:31] amen
[54:32] think of this you're made to absorb and
[54:35] not repel made to absorb and not repel
[54:40] if you take out that wick think of this
[54:43] you take out the wick you've got oil and
[54:51] you've got fire but there's got to be a
[54:54] wick in between the wick in between it's
[55:00] only purpose it's only purpose is to
[55:02] bring the oil that is hidden draws it up
[55:07] that the light that is visible displays
[55:10] oil is down there
[55:13] so the wick itself is really not what's
[55:16] on display it is the fire itself that's
[55:20] on display and the oil itself it's
[55:23] manifested there has to fly the fire is
[55:26] the confirmation that oil is there you
[55:31] with me so this this wick when we look
[55:35] at it
[55:35] it's got to be something that can draw
[55:38] or else it'll just burn up it'll burn up
[55:42] it cannot it's not able to endure think
[55:45] of how that God laid this out even with
[55:47] the ark into saving of knowing this
[55:51] household in this time God God has laid
[55:55] the example you see all the way through
[55:57] the scriptures it is Jesus Christ we
[56:01] don't we don't just all of a sudden come
[56:05] to the realization of Jesus Christ in
[56:08] the New Testament but the New Testament
[56:10] reveals that Jehovah of the old is Jesus
[56:14] of the new and we see the type because
[56:17] this is a book of redemption so it's
[56:19] showing all of these things and
[56:22] depicting here even in the time of Noah
[56:24] where trees were cut down but there was
[56:27] another tree that was cut down the trees
[56:30] that were cut down made out of a gopher
[56:32] wood they were of a special wood but the
[56:36] way that they were they were very spongy
[56:40] type wood they were a wooden me sat like
[56:43] this that was soft for I love this they
[56:48] were soft you wouldn't listen to me
[56:51] you would not have chosen them to make
[56:54] an ark out of
[56:55] you wouldn't have done it but you see
[56:57] the mind of God is on display here
[57:00] because God has the nether tree to be
[57:03] cut down and that tree has sat in it it
[57:07] has life in it it has what the scripture
[57:10] calls pitch which is atonement and when
[57:13] that life comes out of that tree that
[57:15] SAP and now it is put upon the tree but
[57:19] you've got to do one thing first you
[57:22] to heat that pitch so that that pitch
[57:25] now can move upon those other woods that
[57:28] are empty but gopher wood it shows that
[57:31] in our lives it was ordained and made to
[57:34] be absorbent of the real pitch of
[57:37] Almighty God that there's only one way
[57:39] that we are saved only one way that were
[57:43] sealed away and that's by the pitch of
[57:45] Almighty God had it been any other type
[57:47] of wood it would have never absorbed it
[57:50] but when this gopher wood absorbed it it
[57:53] became from soft to hard it came to a
[57:57] place to where he could it could be
[57:59] shaped and formed and it would withstand
[58:02] the judgment the waters of judgment
[58:03] could could rock up against it but the
[58:06] waters of judgment could not penetrate
[58:09] that pitch oh my you see with the pitch
[58:12] itself is what was great
[58:14] it wasn't the wood that was behind it
[58:17] because the word that was behind it was
[58:19] soft and would have been overlooked but
[58:21] it was the pitch it was the pitch
[58:24] it's his life it's Christ's own life
[58:27] it's not the wick it's Christ
[58:29] it's Christ you know it's like the bush
[58:33] Moses came there before the presence of
[58:35] God and God was going to speak to him
[58:37] and Moses marveled that here the bush
[58:42] burned yet was not consumed it was on
[58:47] fire naturally
[58:49] in the end of thinking and reasonings of
[58:52] man we would say that that bush should
[58:54] have burned up but this was not a
[58:55] natural fire this was a supernatural
[58:58] fire God showed these natural types here
[59:02] with the candlesticks but yet it was
[59:05] speaking of a real true spiritual fire
[59:08] that it would be his life it's not a
[59:10] fire that's created by a man because I
[59:13] ran a fire created by man can be put out
[59:16] but a fire where it's God himself our
[59:19] God is a consuming fire the man cannot
[59:23] put that fire out when the fire of God
[59:25] has come down and lit your soul and
[59:28] nothing can put that out there's nothing
[59:30] that can extinguish it there
[59:33] big tests and trials and all those
[59:35] things that will come your way you're
[59:37] spearing might get weak but that fire on
[59:39] the inside you're a Christian today
[59:41] you're a Christian tomorrow you're a
[59:43] Christian on the mountain you're a
[59:45] Christian in the valley you're a
[59:47] Christian when everything's going right
[59:49] you're a Christian when everything's
[59:50] going wrong why because it's not your
[59:53] life it's him and when you think I can't
[59:59] make another step
[1:00:00] it's shows it's not you it's him I'm not
[1:00:05] going to ask hands of those that maybe
[1:00:07] felt that way tonight or who have felt
[1:00:09] that way or will feel that way because
[1:00:12] within it all God proves his
[1:00:16] faithfulness you know these strips wicks
[1:00:24] these wicks that were used you know
[1:00:27] where they got these wicks from they got
[1:00:29] these wicks from the robes of priests
[1:00:32] the priests once their old robe their
[1:00:37] robe had been used because they got a
[1:00:39] new robe in a year they would take the
[1:00:42] priests robe and they would cut strips
[1:00:45] cuz they were made out of linen and they
[1:00:47] would cut strips of the priests robe and
[1:00:50] those strips were called swaddling cloth
[1:00:53] and they would use swaddling cloth or
[1:00:56] wick and that is what was used in order
[1:01:00] to draw up the oil that was down there
[1:01:03] over to the fire that was above let me
[1:01:06] say this you don't remember it I don't
[1:01:10] remember it but we were in when he came
[1:01:14] our high priest to be identified here
[1:01:16] upon this earth you and I were
[1:01:18] identified within him we died with him
[1:01:23] we rose with him hallelujah we were
[1:01:27] identified with him and because we were
[1:01:29] identified when he took the body he sent
[1:01:32] back the Holy Ghost the other part of
[1:01:34] the contract and he lets him know these
[1:01:37] are chips off the master diamond
[1:01:39] these are wicks that are taken from my
[1:01:42] robe of righteousness they are
[1:01:45] identified by my presence they
[1:01:47] illuminated by my life they are
[1:01:50] substance of my substance they have come
[1:01:52] from me they are mine from his own life
[1:01:58] that's why our high priest is also our
[1:02:02] brother guru be to God hallelujah you
[1:02:07] love him amen
[1:02:10] here oh my brother Bama says not only
[1:02:13] can we speak thus of the messengers but
[1:02:16] every true believer is dramatically
[1:02:21] depicted here I love that dramatically
[1:02:24] depicted here it's a drama an act they
[1:02:28] are all drawing from the same source
[1:02:32] they have all been dipped into the same
[1:02:35] Bowl they are dead to themselves and
[1:02:39] their lives are hid with Christ in God
[1:02:42] they are sealed in by the Holy Ghost
[1:02:46] Ephesians 4:30 said grieve not the Holy
[1:02:49] Spirit of God whereby you are sealed
[1:02:51] until the day of redemption
[1:02:53] no man can pluck them out of his hand
[1:02:55] I've just listed let's just let's just
[1:02:57] look at this for a few moments no man
[1:03:00] can pluck them out of his hand their
[1:03:02] lives cannot be tampered with the
[1:03:06] visible life is burning and shining
[1:03:09] giving light and manifestations of the
[1:03:12] Holy Ghost notice their visible life the
[1:03:16] visible life is something that we see in
[1:03:19] one another is that right
[1:03:21] it's a visible life but behind that
[1:03:25] visible life there must be an inner
[1:03:28] invisible life the inner invisible life
[1:03:33] is hidden in God and fed by the Lord's
[1:03:37] word Satan cannot touch them not even
[1:03:41] death can touch them for death has lost
[1:03:44] its sting the grave has lost its victory
[1:03:47] thanks be to gum be unto God
[1:03:50] they had this victory
[1:03:51] in and through the Lord Jesus Christ now
[1:03:55] think of this there's nothing their
[1:04:02] lives could not be tampered with your
[1:04:07] life cannot be tampered with we're here
[1:04:13] upon this earth the purpose that we're
[1:04:17] here is to serve God and and and
[1:04:24] understand the serving God is not just
[1:04:28] about good morality it's deeper than
[1:04:31] that
[1:04:31] and when his purpose is being served
[1:04:34] that is a natural effect you don't have
[1:04:40] to worry about good morality that that
[1:04:42] comes out of the very life of Christ but
[1:04:46] we're talking about serving his purpose
[1:04:49] and recognizing who he is and yielding
[1:04:54] to his working and there's nothing that
[1:04:57] can take us out of this earth until that
[1:05:00] purpose deserved you think I want you to
[1:05:04] think of this think of how many times
[1:05:06] that Paul you've read this through the
[1:05:10] book of Acts and we don't even have to
[1:05:13] go to Paul we can go to the life of the
[1:05:15] Lord Jesus how many times the Bible says
[1:05:17] that they sought to take him the Bible
[1:05:20] said they took counsel to take him here
[1:05:24] he was even move right out of the crowd
[1:05:25] and they didn't get to him you're not
[1:05:30] going to tell me that they did not have
[1:05:31] guards and did not have people that
[1:05:33] would bid would have been adequate to be
[1:05:35] able to get to him but it shows you he
[1:05:37] was under the protection of the prophecy
[1:05:41] of the word he was dwelling in a place
[1:05:45] of safety there is nothing that could
[1:05:49] take him until the time it was to take
[1:05:52] him
[1:05:53] it shows God has appointed times you
[1:05:56] know if it's you and I looking and I
[1:05:58] want you to think of this because listen
[1:06:00] friends even sometimes when we come down
[1:06:01] to different things that take place with
[1:06:04] the physical realm surgeries and on and
[1:06:07] on and on the we can go through you know
[1:06:08] what there's many times unless you've
[1:06:10] got a direct word from God you've got to
[1:06:13] completely just trust in the Lord not
[1:06:14] knowing what's going to be the outcome
[1:06:16] of this are you with me it takes a real
[1:06:19] trust from God I I don't know what's
[1:06:21] going to be the outcome out of this but
[1:06:23] God knows this and so our faith is
[1:06:26] focused in God not in an outcome that we
[1:06:28] would want even though that would be
[1:06:30] fine but ultimately is Lord may you help
[1:06:34] us and may your will be done
[1:06:36] think about this of how that they is
[1:06:38] Paul and and different ones they could
[1:06:40] Paul so many times here he was a light
[1:06:43] unto the Gentiles a light unto the
[1:06:46] church and to think of this of how that
[1:06:48] Satan on everywhere and everywhere tried
[1:06:52] to come at him tried to take his life I
[1:06:54] want you to I want to ask you this did
[1:06:56] it look like a real mighty man of God a
[1:06:59] real Conqueror one who stood there and
[1:07:02] Devils were cast out and there a woman
[1:07:05] who was you know possessed with the
[1:07:07] devil and he could speak in and and
[1:07:09] loosen that spirit from her life and yet
[1:07:12] here he is escaping out of the midst of
[1:07:14] a city lowered in a basket it didn't
[1:07:19] look very glorious but nonetheless it
[1:07:22] was still God that deliver T you risk me
[1:07:28] it didn't look glorious when Paul used
[1:07:30] his Roman citizenship because you see in
[1:07:34] the book of Acts he didn't always play
[1:07:36] that card or use that Z it wasn't just
[1:07:40] saying he wasn't he listened to me he
[1:07:42] wasn't resting on that understand what
[1:07:45] I'm saying Paul wasn't resting on that
[1:07:48] he was a Roman citizen but it happened
[1:07:50] to be that the Spirit of God would even
[1:07:53] lead him in appropriate time and he
[1:07:55] himself would bring us out and say how
[1:07:57] can you do this to him who is a Roman
[1:07:59] citizen I'm asking you who was it that
[1:08:02] brought it to Paul's attention it was
[1:08:05] the same God that met him on the road I
[1:08:09] asked you who was it when Paul stood
[1:08:11] before the pharisees and sadducees
[1:08:13] brought into a council and paul stood on
[1:08:16] the wisdom of God and he split that
[1:08:19] assembly right in half here he he knew
[1:08:21] where they all stood but Paul began to
[1:08:23] take positions in the word that was the
[1:08:26] Word of God and he split that thing
[1:08:28] right down the middle because there's
[1:08:29] many of them Sadducees didn't believe in
[1:08:32] resurrection but the Pharisees did now
[1:08:35] I'm what I'm trying to say is it was the
[1:08:37] wisdom of God you don't know what kind
[1:08:39] of situations that you might be brought
[1:08:41] into and a person can say you mean to
[1:08:44] tell me that you don't believe in a real
[1:08:47] Pentecostal move now they might be
[1:08:48] saying it from an organization but you
[1:08:50] can say I sure do believe in a real
[1:08:53] Pentecostal experience I do believe in a
[1:08:56] God who still manifests himself in
[1:08:59] prophecy in dreams and signs and wonders
[1:09:02] and in tongues and interpretation and
[1:09:05] they're looking at you and said Myles
[1:09:06] this guy believes the same way we do but
[1:09:09] yet you don't believe according to
[1:09:10] organization you believe according to
[1:09:13] the Living God
[1:09:14] what is it the wisdom of God my Lord God
[1:09:23] helped me to stay out of the way help
[1:09:26] you to stay out of the way that he can
[1:09:28] know that don't let me do let me
[1:09:29] classify things to say Lord this is
[1:09:32] really super spiritual and Lord I don't
[1:09:34] know about that I that don't look the
[1:09:37] spiritual eye I just want to be led by
[1:09:40] him because in many of the things that
[1:09:42] are very spiritual we don't even feel
[1:09:45] him
[1:09:54] I wonder how we would be it's a bad
[1:09:56] enough when our fleets their flights are
[1:09:58] delayed at the airport when I had to set
[1:10:03] in an airport sometimes some of the rest
[1:10:04] of you my goodness I hope to get the
[1:10:06] mechanics up here from Atlanta and fix
[1:10:08] that Delta flight and bring this man how
[1:10:11] are we gonna get there how long natural
[1:10:15] part of us right
[1:10:16] we don't always go into the gear and say
[1:10:18] well you know the Lord landed the plane
[1:10:20] for the front we don't always go to that
[1:10:22] gear because sometimes that's not why
[1:10:24] that plane is like that sometimes it's
[1:10:27] just patience god help me one time my
[1:10:34] wife said I was supposed to fly out real
[1:10:36] early go to Arkansas and they canceled
[1:10:39] the plane or they they had to fly up
[1:10:41] people from Atlanta to work on it or
[1:10:43] whatever more and they said you want to
[1:10:45] fly over to Detroit because we can't fly
[1:10:47] this plane more than 9,000 feet in the
[1:10:49] air but we think you can do that as a no
[1:10:52] I'll just stay right here
[1:10:53] my wife said you want me to come get us
[1:10:55] and no I got my laptop I'll just sit
[1:10:57] here get me a coffee I'll study I said
[1:10:59] I'm fine I don't I don't want to run
[1:11:00] around I just wait here during that time
[1:11:02] when I knew this is that hit well God
[1:11:04] you knew I wasn't supposed to speak
[1:11:05] tonight I want to speak that night
[1:11:09] anyhow but I said God you know but I say
[1:11:13] that to you because you know what we're
[1:11:15] not always that way
[1:11:17] and I say word because I include myself
[1:11:19] with you we're not always that way but
[1:11:23] I'm grateful that God brings us to back
[1:11:26] to these places a visible life and the
[1:11:30] invisible life that invisible life on
[1:11:33] the inside that we're Satan cannot touch
[1:11:36] that life not even death or death has
[1:11:40] lost its sting I want you to think Billy
[1:11:43] bomb uses these words and he describes
[1:11:45] us remember this
[1:11:47] what is speaking of the messenger that
[1:11:50] wick that's in the lamp lamp of God that
[1:11:55] speaks of you and I as the believer
[1:11:58] under this message now once you watch
[1:12:02] how he speaks of this now I didn't put
[1:12:04] these up but I just want to refer to him
[1:12:06] think of this in the Book of Revelations
[1:12:09] it never called one of them by name
[1:12:12] there's not one of the name of the
[1:12:14] messengers they're written you see it
[1:12:18] didn't have their name their natural
[1:12:21] name did not have to be wrote God
[1:12:24] declares who His Messenger is he
[1:12:30] declares it by his presence by the word
[1:12:33] that is given to him it matches and is
[1:12:36] the very characteristic of that age and
[1:12:39] it's made manifest he doesn't come to
[1:12:42] convince the believer but he's ordained
[1:12:45] by God to bring the very believer and
[1:12:49] point them into the very presence of
[1:12:51] Almighty God to make God known to that
[1:12:55] age think about how Paul Paul would even
[1:12:58] speak of this in Philippians I believe
[1:13:00] it's chapter 1 where Paul was letting
[1:13:01] them know he said you are partakers of
[1:13:03] my grace to think of what God has opened
[1:13:07] it's God's water it's God's plan you see
[1:13:10] because how things run according to the
[1:13:12] the course and things get off and they
[1:13:14] get off of the program of God but God
[1:13:17] had already reserved seven messengers
[1:13:20] that were ordained that when the Spirit
[1:13:24] of God would move on their life they
[1:13:25] would call that church back to the Word
[1:13:28] of God back to a living reality back to
[1:13:31] an experience and it's something that
[1:13:32] nobody has to prove it to you or try to
[1:13:36] explain it to you it's something that
[1:13:38] just resonates within your heart it's
[1:13:41] something that a church never gave you
[1:13:43] that tall but it's something all of a
[1:13:45] sudden it illuminates to your life I'll
[1:13:49] tell you what I remember as a young boy
[1:13:50] you know it wasn't an odd thing to hear
[1:13:52] the voice of the Prophet playing in our
[1:13:54] home that one then I'll think that was a
[1:13:56] common thing it was a common thing for
[1:13:59] the tapes to be in the car I remember
[1:14:01] before you know when he used to be tape
[1:14:03] player was a was a what do you call it
[1:14:05] uh it's something you look for in a car
[1:14:07] when you bought it hey hey does it have
[1:14:09] cassette no it's just got am/fm radio it
[1:14:12] used to be a time so I remember dad
[1:14:15] carrying one of them on you know them
[1:14:17] because set recorders that had the
[1:14:19] bar on it you're flopping around like
[1:14:20] this had a little old what I'm saying I
[1:14:22] remember all of that I knew there was
[1:14:25] something about that but it wasn't real
[1:14:28] to me at that time but Who am I when
[1:14:31] everything lined up when all the stars
[1:14:34] everything lined up for what God's
[1:14:36] timing in everything from my life then
[1:14:39] everything came together
[1:14:41] then it became life it was no longer
[1:14:44] something that my parents believed or
[1:14:47] where I went to church we believe like
[1:14:49] this and we believe like this
[1:14:50] it didn't matter whether there had been
[1:14:53] a building or not it's something that
[1:14:55] resonated in my heart and it's something
[1:14:57] that said a man's are the truth that
[1:14:59] that is the word of the Living God it's
[1:15:02] something that rose up in my life
[1:15:05] hallelujah you always been tonight it's
[1:15:08] something that illuminated it's
[1:15:10] something that came to light and it
[1:15:13] began to manifest itself and how these
[1:15:16] men they were not called by name their
[1:15:19] strength their strength was from God
[1:15:22] they could have never done it without
[1:15:23] his strength as we just looked at Paul
[1:15:27] we looked at their and others who can go
[1:15:29] through there's no way they could have
[1:15:31] done it their strength came from the
[1:15:33] Lord oh my they were safe in his care
[1:15:39] nothing could pluck them out of his hand
[1:15:41] nothing could separate him from the love
[1:15:43] of God let it be sickness pearl
[1:15:46] nakedness famine sword life or death
[1:15:48] they were truly yielded to him and kept
[1:15:51] by his omniscience hmm the brand puts it
[1:15:58] like this
[1:15:59] he says the seven spirit-filled
[1:16:03] messengers are the lords they may be
[1:16:07] repudiated they may be questioned listen
[1:16:11] to this indeed to human minds they may
[1:16:15] not even seem to qualify
[1:16:18] but nevertheless they are the messengers
[1:16:22] for their age God could have chose men
[1:16:27] that would have fit the human mind for
[1:16:31] that age but remember God's not
[1:16:34] interested and he never matches that of
[1:16:38] the human mind what remember what what
[1:16:41] man calls foolish God calls great and
[1:16:46] what God calls great man calls foolish
[1:16:49] is that right think of this I think
[1:16:54] these words are fitting to understand
[1:16:56] don't just leave him for the messengers
[1:16:58] it pertains he's bringing this down to
[1:17:00] us to reflect on this to human minds
[1:17:03] they may not even seem to qualify but
[1:17:05] nonetheless they are the messengers for
[1:17:07] their age God used in Abraham he lied he
[1:17:11] used a Moses he rebelled a Jonah he
[1:17:14] disobeyed a Samson he sinned a David he
[1:17:18] murdered he also used a Joshua and a
[1:17:21] Joseph listen to this and those with
[1:17:24] severe blemishes far outnumber those
[1:17:28] whose histories seem to be perfect
[1:17:34] it would seem it would sing to the human
[1:17:39] mind but God would choose only those who
[1:17:44] was seemingly perfect and God has some
[1:17:47] of that sprinkled down through time are
[1:17:50] you with me that's why I remember Paul
[1:17:52] could say brother and he said you see
[1:17:54] after the flesh how that many noble are
[1:17:58] not called how many wise are not called
[1:18:01] how many mighty men after the flesh are
[1:18:04] not called but he said God had chosen it
[1:18:08] this is the thing God had chosen those
[1:18:11] things that are foolish those base
[1:18:14] things those weak things why did God
[1:18:19] choose that it was not because he chose
[1:18:22] how to do so that have just been a
[1:18:24] weakness on display but God chose
[1:18:27] because it's vessels lives wicks that
[1:18:31] can be yielded to him
[1:18:35] those with blemishes far outnumber those
[1:18:38] with perd that would seem to be perfect
[1:18:41] but all were and all are his none there
[1:18:44] deny that he used them by and through
[1:18:47] the Holy Spirit that he put within them
[1:18:49] to their own master they stood or fell
[1:18:52] and in them all was accomplished the
[1:18:54] sovereign will of God
[1:19:03] you look in the book of Judges and on
[1:19:06] down through the Scriptures God never
[1:19:09] chose it wasn't great people as far as
[1:19:14] by earth standards God chose people it
[1:19:20] was live
[1:19:20] listen he had already chosen look at
[1:19:22] Moses intellectual here was a sharp
[1:19:27] sharp man look at Paul sharp very
[1:19:31] intellectual Paul knew many different
[1:19:34] languages but look what Paul said I have
[1:19:38] learned to count vel those things but
[1:19:42] dung that I may win Jesus Christ Paul
[1:19:47] said I was a Pharisee of the Pharisees
[1:19:49] now look at this what was that because
[1:19:52] there were many Pharisees many men in
[1:19:55] that day who locked up the kingdom of
[1:19:57] God and would not allow the people to go
[1:19:59] into it but yet what was different about
[1:20:01] Paul it was the fibers that was on the
[1:20:04] inside what was it that was different in
[1:20:08] the city of Philippi
[1:20:09] there were fibers that were there within
[1:20:13] lives that the Spirit of God moving
[1:20:15] along it could be absorbed through their
[1:20:18] life to declare Jesus Christ I see who
[1:20:22] was it that led Lydia out by the
[1:20:24] riverside that day when pulling them
[1:20:27] made their way in the journey who was
[1:20:29] that better line that that was Almighty
[1:20:31] God that aligned it Paul here he is
[1:20:34] coming with the word and there were
[1:20:36] lives and hearts that could receive it
[1:20:40] you see it as we look at it even in a
[1:20:44] person who's smart listen friends
[1:20:46] sometimes even in our weaknesses we see
[1:20:49] with Paul we see with Moses these were
[1:20:52] very sharp men but yet they had to be
[1:20:55] come to a place of weakness in order
[1:21:00] that the fibers God could move and bring
[1:21:03] forth the fibers that was laying there
[1:21:06] you think about it even in the time even
[1:21:09] in the week things even in the weakness
[1:21:12] of our life it's God coming down because
[1:21:15] remember
[1:21:16] we can even allow our weaknesses to be
[1:21:19] excuses because when he Moses got in his
[1:21:23] presence Moses had all the excuses as a
[1:21:26] matter of fact brother Brad Musa like
[1:21:27] this he said he had seven arguments
[1:21:29] against God of why he could not do it
[1:21:31] you see what he tried to do
[1:21:34] Moses tried to do these things but when
[1:21:37] he got in the presence of God the
[1:21:39] presence of God made it very clear and
[1:21:42] Moses himself said I can't do this i
[1:21:45] can't Lord I can't I can't even talk
[1:21:47] right I can't do this now look at this
[1:21:50] God could not even allow those
[1:21:52] weaknesses to be an argument against his
[1:21:56] yielding but the presence of God moves
[1:21:59] into a place to where he will yield his
[1:22:03] weaknesses I read a statement here some
[1:22:11] time ago I think it to be a fitting
[1:22:14] statement humility is not thinking less
[1:22:22] of yourself but humility is thinking of
[1:22:26] yourself less now thinking less of
[1:22:31] yourself I'm a nobody I don't know the
[1:22:34] real truth about it is we will it don't
[1:22:36] believe all that about ourselves we need
[1:22:38] the help of God and I believe he's been
[1:22:42] helping us and he is helping us I just
[1:22:46] say it like that when we get to a place
[1:22:50] that we feel like we can do something
[1:22:52] right there God can't do nothing it just
[1:22:55] it stops right there but it's when God
[1:22:57] brings us to a place you know I find the
[1:23:00] longer that I go it's not a high the can
[1:23:02] pastor it's God is a pastor or both
[1:23:05] Simon didn't you know that from the
[1:23:06] beginning I did but yet I know it in a
[1:23:08] greater way I look at it now it's not
[1:23:11] odd there can be a husband but God is
[1:23:13] the one who brings forth that out of my
[1:23:15] life the same way with the father same
[1:23:17] way with the mother it's not even though
[1:23:19] the attributes are there but I'm
[1:23:21] trusting in him you understand what I'm
[1:23:24] saying it's trusting in him because
[1:23:26] without him we're nothing
[1:23:29] we're nothing without him and the Lord
[1:23:32] Jesus Christ Himself showing us as the
[1:23:34] high priest I can do nothing without him
[1:23:37] but to think of how that God has so
[1:23:41] brought in our life if we can look at
[1:23:43] what God has done through the messenger
[1:23:46] the same Holy Spirit we've been made
[1:23:49] partakers of you believe that same holy
[1:23:54] spirit the same spirit of God moving
[1:23:58] right here in services I'll tell you
[1:24:01] right now I believe with all my heart
[1:24:02] brother Branham would and would love to
[1:24:05] be able to come you know I trust you to
[1:24:07] be able to love to come here and preach
[1:24:08] to us listen to her you know brother Ram
[1:24:13] talks about going out to that trailer
[1:24:14] park you hear him in the first Shalom
[1:24:16] message he preaches didn't listen to
[1:24:17] power transformation brother Brown will
[1:24:19] refer that little group of people
[1:24:21] meeting in that trailer park right there
[1:24:23] he wasn't a massive crowd it was a small
[1:24:25] crowd it's not about number but it's the
[1:24:28] thing what he said he said I consider
[1:24:29] this like the backside of the desert
[1:24:31] where I can come he said and I can
[1:24:33] preach without people having
[1:24:34] superstitions because you cease to super
[1:24:38] specious thoughts can bind up the Holy
[1:24:40] Spirit but when the Holy Spirit the
[1:24:43] Bible talks about in the book of
[1:24:44] Thessalonians with the these'll and with
[1:24:46] the Thessalonians they received it not
[1:24:48] as the word of men but as it was the
[1:24:51] Word of God and the word Paul even
[1:24:53] admonished them he said prayed that the
[1:24:55] word would have free course that the
[1:24:59] word would have Liberty in our lives and
[1:25:02] our myths for this by this spirit by one
[1:25:04] spirit we're all baptized into one body
[1:25:10] all been made to drink into one spirit
[1:25:13] we are partakers of that same life no no
[1:25:17] our gift the gift within our lives that
[1:25:20] that to declare it's not in our life to
[1:25:22] declare as the star declared as far as
[1:25:24] to be a prophet but it is that prophet
[1:25:27] it came for a purpose and a reason to
[1:25:29] make Jesus Christ real to us in this
[1:25:33] generation it to lift up the standard
[1:25:36] that he's still the same God he he still
[1:25:40] gives a real true experience
[1:25:42] he's the same in every way in every
[1:25:44] aspect and then through that there is
[1:25:48] hearts and lives that believe that are
[1:25:51] touched by that our wicks that ordained
[1:25:54] to be able to express his life this is
[1:25:59] where Paul could say let me let me wind
[1:26:02] this down here this is where the Lord
[1:26:04] Jesus that scripture we looked at some
[1:26:07] weeks ago where he says let your light
[1:26:09] so shine before men that they may see
[1:26:15] your good works and glorify your
[1:26:18] heavenly father which is in heaven our
[1:26:22] good works Paul makes it very clear when
[1:26:26] we're speaking of this of the good works
[1:26:29] Paul makes it very clear what these
[1:26:31] works are it's not religious works I
[1:26:35] think it's a wonderful thing to hold a
[1:26:37] door open for somebody I think that's a
[1:26:40] very courteous thing I think it's a very
[1:26:42] courteous thing if you see someone in
[1:26:44] need that you're able to minister to
[1:26:47] their need but these works are not just
[1:26:51] works that all would be a religious
[1:26:55] practice but it's what is ordained
[1:26:58] already within our lives
[1:27:01] Paul said very clearly we are his
[1:27:05] workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto
[1:27:10] good works when when were when were we
[1:27:15] created in Christ Jesus unto good works
[1:27:17] this is through and by the new birth but
[1:27:20] what does the new birth release that
[1:27:23] which God hath before ordained that we
[1:27:27] should walk in them
[1:27:29] everything right there I think a brother
[1:27:33] branham was just reading across some
[1:27:35] things in the message a brother Brown
[1:27:37] find him saying over and over he said
[1:27:39] you get the people he said to the new
[1:27:41] birth to the indwelling of the Holy
[1:27:43] Spirit and the rest will take care of
[1:27:46] itself
[1:27:47] because it's a life working with in our
[1:27:50] lives it's not our power it's his power
[1:27:54] not our might not our strength is power
[1:27:57] think of this when they said what shall
[1:27:59] we do they asked the Lord Jesus
[1:28:01] what shall we do that we would work the
[1:28:03] works of God what's what he said believe
[1:28:07] this is the work of God that you believe
[1:28:10] on Him whom he had sent this is a work
[1:28:17] of God it's it's given to you to believe
[1:28:22] it's given to you and the light coming
[1:28:25] across the path it begins to move in
[1:28:28] your heart and bring you into that place
[1:28:31] that's why friends that when a longing
[1:28:33] is within a heart for God a church can
[1:28:38] never satisfy never just setting in a
[1:28:41] church can never satisfy it but it's it
[1:28:45] must it's a union with the Lord Jesus
[1:28:48] Christ to where it's United with him
[1:28:52] then that's a satisfying portion that's
[1:28:55] a that's a life it's satisfying and
[1:28:57] you're able to draw from him even when
[1:29:00] you're not sitting here you're tapped
[1:29:01] into that oil the fire of God is lit
[1:29:04] upon your life and you're drawing from
[1:29:07] him all that you have need of ordained
[1:29:12] unto good works that's close remember
[1:29:20] how the Scriptures they speak of James
[1:29:23] James and Paul speak of Abraham they
[1:29:27] take one man
[1:29:29] Abraham speaks of the faith that God saw
[1:29:36] stagger not Romans for stagger not their
[1:29:41] own belief but was strong giving
[1:29:43] praising to God
[1:29:45] he looked Paul was making known to us
[1:29:51] those things with God saw then James
[1:29:54] brings to the place to say show me your
[1:29:59] faith by your works they're looking at
[1:30:03] the same thing but it's a different
[1:30:07] angle you see whatever the life is the
[1:30:12] inner life it manifests the hidden life
[1:30:17] on the inside it manifests what was down
[1:30:20] there within Abraham's life when God
[1:30:22] spoke to his heart it began to reflect
[1:30:25] through his life his walk began to
[1:30:29] change
[1:30:30] he came out from where he was and he
[1:30:33] kept walking to the Lord who spoke to
[1:30:37] him I find it tremendous few weeks back
[1:30:44] I'm listening to the message for the
[1:30:47] brem says what Abraham did that day when
[1:30:51] he was down in Babylon he said they
[1:30:52] Abraham got out in a field and he prayed
[1:30:55] and he said this is what Abraham prayed
[1:30:58] he prayed and said Lord how you use Noah
[1:31:02] what you did through Noah you were that
[1:31:05] you were the Living God
[1:31:06] Lord will you manifest yourself to me in
[1:31:10] that way you see here Moses we realize
[1:31:14] this could have been handed down but
[1:31:15] that it just gripped my heart that day
[1:31:18] when I heard that absolute there's a
[1:31:20] point of reference something he could
[1:31:23] look it was there and said lord I
[1:31:25] believe what you did in Noah's day and I
[1:31:29] believe you're the same God and when he
[1:31:31] did that God spoke to him come out of
[1:31:36] this land
[1:31:37] come into the land then I'll show you
[1:31:42] and Abraham's works begin to declare his
[1:31:47] faith it began to express it it wasn't
[1:31:51] just works of just in ingest and just a
[1:31:56] level here of just things that we can
[1:32:00] just see you know here but it was it was
[1:32:02] a life that was actually being lived and
[1:32:05] being expressed in Abraham's walk oh my
[1:32:12] you love him tonight
[1:32:23] or Jesus
[1:32:29] lord
[1:32:33] you've what really directed us more to
[1:32:38] look not only at you care in your love
[1:32:43] for our lives but you have directed us
[1:32:47] Lord as we can see how that you have
[1:32:50] used God every one of your messengers
[1:32:57] your prophet told us like this that
[1:33:00] every true believer is in the hand of
[1:33:03] God and control from his love and power
[1:33:05] and received the full benefit of all
[1:33:08] that God is to the believer
[1:33:13] Lord sometimes
[1:33:14] [Music]
[1:33:16] within our lives Lord may be setting
[1:33:20] here tonight Lord we we need a
[1:33:23] deliverance in our lives lord like Paul
[1:33:25] did in some of the places he was in
[1:33:28] maybe a direction Lord trying to find
[1:33:31] the will of the Lord like Paul he the
[1:33:36] Bible said he is saying he tested to see
[1:33:39] whether to go into Asia we know what
[1:33:44] Paul eventually went into Asia but at
[1:33:47] that time where it speaks that there in
[1:33:49] the book of Acts he wasn't permitted to
[1:33:52] go at that time but rather he who was
[1:33:56] directed by You Lord to go I believe it
[1:34:01] was into Macedonia
[1:34:04] there was some sheep that were already
[1:34:06] there they were already sheep they just
[1:34:11] didn't know they were Lord Lord to see
[1:34:16] that it's you that directs your word
[1:34:20] your light your life across our path
[1:34:24] Lane Lord Jesus truly you display
[1:34:30] through all of this it's not the
[1:34:34] strength of the human instrument then
[1:34:39] Lord God in many cases the human
[1:34:41] instrument what you have called and
[1:34:45] ordained for their lives
[1:34:47] [Music]
[1:34:49] they're so incapable of doing it
[1:34:54] Lord you gave these examples of your
[1:34:59] working down through the Scriptures and
[1:35:01] how fitting in this our Lord that you
[1:35:05] make it known to us Lord because lord
[1:35:09] has were called and ordained in this
[1:35:11] hour to take a rapture nor Jesus it will
[1:35:17] not be our strength but not God it will
[1:35:22] be your supernatural working would that
[1:35:26] working Lord where you are working in
[1:35:29] our lives and working among us now Lord
[1:35:32] it will be come in a greater way your
[1:35:36] prophet tells us that Lord it'll be a
[1:35:38] refilling of the Holy Spirit what has
[1:35:43] worked while the whole time while that
[1:35:46] capstone has been coming down but I look
[1:35:50] at that Lord that it's not something
[1:35:54] where you'll overpower us No
[1:35:58] it's a yielding it's yielding Lord help
[1:36:06] us Lord within it that was not to make
[1:36:09] excuses of our weaknesses help us to
[1:36:14] recognize our weaknesses and to
[1:36:18] recognize that the God who is in us is
[1:36:24] greater than any weakness the Lord it's
[1:36:31] through our weakness your strength is
[1:36:34] made perfect for God our minds our
[1:36:41] finite minds cannot comprehend that but
[1:36:46] inwardly Lord we say Amen to it what
[1:36:52] perhaps here tonight there are wigs
[1:36:55] that are sitting here tonight that have
[1:36:58] never been lit but in their hearts or
[1:37:02] God striking Lord something that goes
[1:37:08] beyond Lord human reason and human
[1:37:10] understanding beyond explanations Lord
[1:37:15] Lord God where it can be from their
[1:37:17] heart Lord that can say that's a truth
[1:37:22] that's a truth Lord God this is for me
[1:37:28] this oil this fire it's for me Lord it's
[1:37:31] from my life Lord God had settled in
[1:37:34] their heart state they don't want just a
[1:37:36] church life but they want that life
[1:37:40] within him I pray tonight Lord would you
[1:37:43] just move for their requests in would
[1:37:46] move for their requests Lord you're the

[1:42:26] [Music]
[1:42:32] you know many of you no doubt you
[1:42:34] remember when the brand will give us
[1:42:37] that point regarding those that came to
[1:42:39] see Dwight Moody and that reporter
[1:42:42] showed up in that meeting and reporter
[1:42:45] said he's as bald as a pumpkin I said I
[1:42:49] don't see he said he stumbles stammers
[1:42:51] all over the place and spits and he can
[1:42:54] t pronounce his words right and
[1:42:56] everything else the brem said on that
[1:43:00] editorial he said Dwight Moody couldn't
[1:43:02] even read it he said but his man that
[1:43:07] was there with him began to read it to
[1:43:08] him you know the white moody just
