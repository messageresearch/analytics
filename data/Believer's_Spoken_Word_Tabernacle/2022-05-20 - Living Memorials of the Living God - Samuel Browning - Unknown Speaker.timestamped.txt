[36:14] but it's god in you
[36:16] and the same god who
[36:18] created
[36:20] in the beginning

[36:23] is living inside
[36:25] of his believing children

[38:38] i'd just like to say so appreciate

[38:54] amen i
[38:57] we streaming there the past
[39:00] two services
[39:02] i tell you
[39:04] i
[39:05] i said this it's just not the same it's
[39:08] not the same i mean the word is is
[39:10] wonderful but it's just it's not the
[39:12] same
[39:13] i'm just so glad that that's
[39:16] to me it's just not
[39:17] well i guess it's an option if you're
[39:19] sick but i just i i'm so glad that we
[39:22] get to come to the house of god
[39:24] amen because as we come to the house of
[39:27] god it's we are
[39:30] channels one to another and the spirit
[39:32] of god just moving here among us and
[39:35] that's something that just is so
[39:37] precious and just to see one another and
[39:39] be with one another and
[39:41] more likes of fire coming together
[39:44] oh my this is what god intended it to be
[39:47] amen
[39:49] so let's just look in joshua chapter
[39:51] four verse one
[39:53] and it came to pass when all the people
[39:55] were clean passed over jordan that the
[39:58] lord spake unto joshua saying
[40:01] take you twelve men out of the people
[40:03] out of every tribe of man
[40:06] and command ye them saying take you
[40:08] hence out of the midst of jordan
[40:12] out of the place where the priest's feet
[40:14] stood firm 12 stone so they're taking 12
[40:18] stones out of the jordan where the feet
[40:21] of the priest have stood
[40:22] and you shall carry them over with you
[40:25] and leave them in the lodging place
[40:28] where you shall lodge this night
[40:31] then joshua called the twelve men whom
[40:33] he had prepared of the children of
[40:36] israel out of every tribe
[40:38] of man
[40:39] joshua said unto them
[40:42] passover before the ark of the lord your
[40:44] god into the midst of jordan and take
[40:47] you up every man of you a stone
[40:50] upon his shoulder according to
[40:52] the number of the tribes of the children
[40:54] of israel
[40:56] that this and i want you just to look
[40:58] here in verse 6 that this may be a sign
[41:01] among you
[41:02] that when your children ask their
[41:05] fathers in time to come saying
[41:08] what mean ye by these stones
[41:11] then you shall answer them that the
[41:14] waters of jordan were cut off before the
[41:18] ark of the covenant of the lord
[41:20] when it passed over jordan the waters of
[41:23] jordan were cut off
[41:25] and these stones shall be a memorial
[41:27] unto the children of israel forever
[41:31] and the children of israel did so as
[41:33] joshua commanded and took up 12 stones
[41:36] out of the midst of jordan as the lord
[41:38] spake unto joshua according to the
[41:40] number of the tribes of the children of
[41:42] israel and carried them over with them
[41:45] unto the place where they lodged and
[41:48] laid them down there
[41:50] and joshua set up 12 stones in the midst
[41:54] of jordan
[41:55] in the place where the feet of the
[41:58] priest bear the ark of the covenant
[42:01] stood so they took 12 stones out
[42:04] and there's 12 stones that went in where
[42:06] the priest's feet stood
[42:09] so joshua let me read verse 9 again
[42:11] joshua set up 12 stones in the midst of
[42:14] jordan in the place where the feet of
[42:17] the priest which bear the ark of the
[42:19] covenant stood
[42:21] and they are there
[42:22] unto this day
[42:24] amen may god bless you bless the reading
[42:26] of the word as you're being seated
[42:29] i'd just like to speak just for a few
[42:31] moments on living memorials of the
[42:33] living god
[42:34] living memorials of the living god
[42:38] and we were looking at this here a few
[42:41] weeks ago and
[42:43] of how that coming into this place of
[42:46] promise
[42:47] and our promised land and how that
[42:49] joshua in coming into this the word
[42:53] itself
[42:54] is what was placed first
[42:56] joshua when he he put his his confession
[43:00] his confession was based upon the word
[43:03] that god
[43:04] was going to open up the jordan and make
[43:07] a way
[43:08] you know brother branham said it like
[43:10] this in the message of guide
[43:12] he said the pillar of fire
[43:14] led them all the way through the
[43:16] wilderness and he led them up to the
[43:18] promised land gate and that's as far as
[43:21] he was going to go
[43:24] to think that the pillar of fire now the
[43:26] pillar of fire didn't stay over there
[43:28] but you see and now it would come to a
[43:30] time where the pillar of fire has led
[43:32] them to the promise now it's time for
[43:36] the people of god to believe the word
[43:40] that god has spoken
[43:42] now we know that god's god always in
[43:45] fulfilling his word
[43:47] it takes the holy spirit to come to
[43:50] unctionize that word
[43:53] it takes god coming even upon hearts and
[43:55] lives that
[43:56] lives begin to hunger for the living god
[43:59] to come and and to move upon his word
[44:03] and to know that when we if we could
[44:04] just jump ahead just for a moment that
[44:07] that pillar of fire when joshua would
[44:10] meet him over in the land it was not a
[44:13] pillar of fire but god had come down in
[44:16] the form of the captain of the lord's
[44:18] host
[44:19] so it was the same god all along but how
[44:22] god will lead us to the promise now
[44:26] it was now time for as the word would be
[44:29] placed there first and the word itself
[44:31] when we think of the ark going forth
[44:35] into the into the waters and remember
[44:38] how that god had spoke through joshua to
[44:41] stay within a certain distance of that
[44:44] of the ark and stay behind it you've
[44:46] never passed this way before
[44:48] so the word was was opening up the way
[44:52] and you know when we look at this it the
[44:55] ark itself would speak that the word
[44:58] would be embodied it would be expressed
[45:01] that it's going to go into jordan to
[45:04] make a way to open up the way for the
[45:06] people of the promise to cross over it
[45:09] would be the way of the word and the
[45:12] path of the word that would open up the
[45:15] way into the promised land you think
[45:18] about it of how that when you know god
[45:21] when he comes to give leadership to our
[45:24] lives you know there's god will always
[45:27] his leadership always comes by his word
[45:30] and and the guide that god has given is
[45:33] the word itself being made manifest
[45:36] think think about when here they stood
[45:39] on the day of pentecost and they came
[45:41] out from the upper room and there were
[45:43] those that begin to ask questions what
[45:45] must we do to be saved and peter begin
[45:49] to express the word he's he's letting
[45:52] him know this what you are seeing is the
[45:55] promise that god has made in his word
[45:58] and that word has been fulfilled
[46:01] now when that word is being placed
[46:02] before the people it's now up to them
[46:05] will they follow the word of god on into
[46:09] the promise of god
[46:11] you see god in order to provide a god a
[46:14] person could look at the scriptures but
[46:16] the guide itself is when god comes down
[46:19] and gets into his word and makes that
[46:22] word alive makes it real
[46:25] it's just like when peter stood there in
[46:27] the house of cornelius now think of him
[46:29] the angel told cornelius uh regarding
[46:32] there is a man a simon you know a tanner
[46:35] by trade he he calls him out and tells
[46:38] him where to go and there's a man you
[46:40] know down there on the street of joppa
[46:42] and the thing an angel would tell him go
[46:45] down there and and require and ask of
[46:48] that man to come here
[46:50] and to stand in your house and to
[46:52] minister you're you're desiring to know
[46:55] more of god
[46:56] but i want you to go get in contact with
[46:58] peter
[46:59] because god had a representation of that
[47:03] word upon the earth and god has reserved
[47:06] it that the guide himself would be
[47:09] christ embodied in his people because
[47:13] when we think of the ark of the lord it
[47:16] god used that as a type to where it
[47:19] would be his very word his presence that
[47:23] would be abiding in the very heart and
[47:26] life of the believer it would be his
[47:28] word that would be dwelling within your
[47:31] life not a dead letter but a living god
[47:34] a living reality in your life to where
[47:38] peter could stand there and when he came
[47:40] to cornelius house and he said i'm here
[47:43] and cornelius said we're all gathered
[47:46] here and we are waiting to hear the
[47:49] words that god has given to you see in
[47:52] that moment the guide was standing
[47:55] present in peter's life
[47:58] to guide them into a place and the bible
[48:01] said while peter yet spake these words
[48:03] peter went through the prophecies of
[48:07] those things that concerned the
[48:09] fulfillment of the messiah and the
[48:11] coming of the holy ghost and peter
[48:14] preached that with a living experience
[48:17] in his life it wasn't something that was
[48:20] secondhanded but the guide himself was
[48:23] speaking through peter and was giving
[48:26] the leadership into the promise and the
[48:29] bible says that while peter yet spake
[48:32] these words the holy ghost fell upon
[48:35] them
[48:37] their hearts were made available to
[48:39] receive the word of almighty god so the
[48:43] guide itself is the living word of god
[48:46] made manifest
[48:48] so when we consider this in this hour
[48:52] brother branham would say it like this
[48:54] and i have heard but now i see
[48:56] he said you know thinking of the church
[48:59] he said you're looking at it with your
[49:00] own eyes the living word of god made
[49:04] manifest the promise of the hour in the
[49:07] last days
[49:09] looking with your own eyes at the living
[49:12] word being interpreted in natural form
[49:16] god among us
[49:18] so the people what what they are
[49:20] witnessing is when we talk about the
[49:23] promise of malachi 4
[49:25] that is a promise that god has made that
[49:28] he has come down to fulfill that promise
[49:32] and god will not fulfill it through any
[49:35] other way but through the life of a
[49:38] believer and god already had a channel
[49:41] when we look at that promise
[49:43] of malachi 4 you think a virgin shall
[49:46] conceive when you look at all of those
[49:48] promises
[49:49] god already had ordained vessels that he
[49:53] would use to manifest that word through
[49:56] in that time it would take a as as god
[50:00] would work through that and the things
[50:02] that were taking place in the ministry
[50:05] when we think of brother adam the
[50:06] ministry that was here as god continued
[50:09] to unfold his word in this hour it was
[50:13] more than just signs and miracles that
[50:15] were being done
[50:16] because let me tell you many of the
[50:18] pentecostals were stirred up about the
[50:20] signs and wonders but that's not what
[50:23] this message was about
[50:25] this message it came to bring a
[50:28] relationship between god and his people
[50:32] to where the people of god would
[50:35] recognize the living god in their midst
[50:38] and there would become a union between
[50:40] god and his children god would make that
[50:44] word so real he would make it manifest
[50:47] sure the signs and wonders they would
[50:49] confirm that he is here and if he is
[50:52] here then every promise that he's ever
[50:55] given in his word he's here to make good
[50:58] upon that promise let me tell you he's
[51:01] the same god right here tonight
[51:08] so here as god interprets it he
[51:10] interprets it by manifesting it
[51:13] now there's there's two memorials when
[51:15] we look at this here
[51:17] that i want to just kind of deal with
[51:19] here a moment
[51:20] do find that there's the 12 stones that
[51:22] come up that they're brought up out of
[51:24] the midst of jordan where the feet of
[51:27] the priest were at
[51:29] and then we have 12 stones that are put
[51:32] in where the priest's feet stood you see
[51:36] it shows one thing that that when we
[51:39] look at this and see the reality that
[51:42] there is no way
[51:44] that man could cross over into the
[51:46] promised land this was all a type about
[51:49] you as a believer crossing into the
[51:52] promised land of the word of god the
[51:55] holy ghost
[51:56] we could not get in there without the
[51:59] word himself coming down and becoming
[52:03] flesh the word had to become flesh the
[52:06] word itself had to bleed because a
[52:09] spirit can't do that but god had to
[52:11] become flesh he had to die there had to
[52:15] be blood that was shed and then he rose
[52:18] up on that easter morning now to think
[52:20] of this the word itself came down and
[52:24] took our place
[52:27] amen there was one
[52:30] who went and took our place in the
[52:33] judgment
[52:34] in death that we might take his place
[52:37] in other words we were those stones that
[52:40] were there in the river jordan
[52:44] but god came down and brought us out of
[52:47] jordan and there's one that stands there
[52:50] there's a memorial that stands there
[52:53] that i am your waymaker i'm the one who
[52:56] made a way for you when you couldn't get
[52:58] over there the ark itself the word
[53:01] became flesh to open up the way for you
[53:04] and i think about it that god would come
[53:06] time and time again in this generation
[53:09] and every time for a heart that desires
[53:12] to know god in a living reality
[53:15] to know god in a personal way there's a
[53:18] hunger that you didn't place within
[53:20] yourself and let me tell you something
[53:23] there is nothing of this world that can
[53:25] ever satisfy that thirst you can go from
[53:28] here you can labor after this you can
[53:31] labor after that you can go everywhere
[53:34] in the world but there is nothing that
[53:36] will place that rest of the holy ghost
[53:40] of you coming into a personal
[53:42] relationship with jesus christ it's god
[53:45] who placed that hunger there and blessed
[53:48] are they that hunger and thirst for
[53:50] righteousness for they shall be filled
[53:53] let me tell you something if you've got
[53:55] a desire to serve god that is greater
[53:58] than every devil out of hell
[54:02] you might say brother samuel i'm longing
[54:04] for the holy ghost but if you've got the
[54:06] least desire in your life it's greater
[54:09] than every devil
[54:11] because that desire is a heavenly desire
[54:15] and it's greater than every demon
[54:17] there's not a devil big enough strong
[54:19] enough bad enough or big enough that can
[54:21] hinder the word from coming to pass
[54:26] oh let's glorify almighty god
[54:29] hallelujah if you've got the least
[54:32] desire move on that pulsation
[54:35] brother samuel it's a small desire it's
[54:38] bigger than every devil
[54:41] [Applause]
[54:43] hallelujah all through this building
[54:45] right here the man standing right here
[54:47] it started from a small desire a desire
[54:51] that was tucked down
[54:52] way down in there oh there was darkness
[54:54] over it there was all sorts of things
[54:57] things of the world but there was a
[54:58] desire that one day i'm gonna serve god
[55:01] but i don't know how i don't know how to
[55:04] get there but he came to me there was a
[55:07] desire that was on the inside god put
[55:10] that desire there
[55:14] sunday school teacher didn't put it
[55:16] there
[55:18] daddy reading the bible listen to the
[55:20] message didn't put it there
[55:22] that desire came from the mind of god
[55:25] and it was here when i came into this
[55:27] earth
[55:29] it was a longing for a fellowship with
[55:31] almighty god
[55:34] brother samuel what should i do well you
[55:36] put the word first put your confession
[55:39] with the word
[55:41] before the jordan ever opened up the
[55:44] word had to be put first
[55:47] and joshua put his confession right upon
[55:50] the word
[55:51] think about it this the word was made
[55:53] flesh and took our place in judgment in
[55:56] death i think of the scripture here if i
[55:58] can cut in and read it of second
[56:00] corinthians 5 21 for he
[56:02] hath made him to be sin for us
[56:07] who knew no sin
[56:11] that we might be made the righteousness
[56:14] of god in him let me tell you
[56:17] the preaching of the gospel is not about
[56:19] a historical event
[56:22] but it's a living god who comes right
[56:24] here right personal right up next to us
[56:27] and there's a faith that begins to rise
[56:30] in our hearts that wouldn't that moves
[56:32] us beyond doubts
[56:35] it brings what is it listen friends it's
[56:37] not something that can be worked up it's
[56:39] not what a music does it's nothing that
[56:42] that old music music doesn't do this
[56:44] it's his presence that begins to warm
[56:48] our hearts it's his presence moving in
[56:51] our midst that begins to get our
[56:53] attention
[56:54] what is it it's the guide of the word
[56:58] himself
[57:00] oh glory be to god it becomes real to us
[57:02] that he's for me he is my liberty
[57:05] now think of this in verse 20 of joshua
[57:08] 4.
[57:09] and those 12 stones which they took out
[57:12] of jordan did joshua pitch
[57:15] in gilgame
[57:16] and he spake unto the children of israel
[57:18] saying when your children shall ask
[57:20] their fathers in time to come saying
[57:23] what mean these stones then you shall
[57:26] let your children know saying israel
[57:29] came over this jordan on dry land
[57:31] for the lord your god dried up the
[57:33] waters of jordan from before you
[57:36] until you were passed over as the lord
[57:39] your god did to the red sea which he
[57:41] dried up before us until we were gone
[57:45] over so the same
[57:47] experience of the same god
[57:50] who moved down upon the red sea
[57:53] and they went forth on dry ground
[57:56] god did the same thing
[57:58] one more time
[58:00] amen when there was no way that was open
[58:03] to them and the enemy was breathing down
[58:06] their necks
[58:07] god
[58:08] made a way
[58:10] how did he make a way speak the word and
[58:13] go forward
[58:14] his word opened up the pathway
[58:18] and that's the same way it it has been
[58:20] here with the jordan god come down once
[58:23] again and he makes his word alive and
[58:26] real the same experience of the same god
[58:30] that they walk across on dry ground
[58:32] think of this how the bible records it
[58:34] that the waters were stayed
[58:38] they were stayed
[58:40] it didn't become a pooling reservoir
[58:42] they were stayed how god stopped it
[58:46] where the waters stood up and they were
[58:48] able to walk down right through the
[58:50] midst of it maybe four or five hours
[58:53] with all those millions that crossed
[58:55] through there and had to pass through in
[58:57] that time but god stayed the waters why
[59:01] because it was a time for his children
[59:04] to cross into the promise
[59:06] god's still a waymaker tonight
[59:10] god's a waymaker tonight god knows how
[59:12] to bring a stay in your life god knows
[59:14] how to bring a stay in your family god
[59:16] knows how to bring a stay in your body
[59:19] god is still the same god
[59:22] oh glory be to god think of it that all
[59:25] the people of the earth might know the
[59:27] hand of the lord that it is mighty that
[59:30] you might fear that ye might fear the
[59:33] lord your god forever
[59:36] now think of it this in this word
[59:39] this word campaign if i can say it in
[59:41] that way
[59:42] this is god's word and it's the only way
[59:45] that god will ever fulfill his word
[59:48] is through believers
[59:50] is that right
[59:52] remember the pillar of fire was given
[59:54] direction through joshua
[59:56] and there the word of the lord went
[59:58] forth and there were believers in that
[1:00:01] day that god was going to prove his word
[1:00:04] through now think of this how brother
[1:00:06] braham says this in proving his word he
[1:00:09] says it like this he says it is by
[1:00:12] believers that he proves his word by
[1:00:15] he can only prove his word not by
[1:00:17] unbelievers it's only by the believers
[1:00:20] that he can prove his word no matter how
[1:00:22] much the rest of them claim to be oh i
[1:00:24] believe brother see if you do god will
[1:00:27] prove it so because we look and we see
[1:00:29] the others and how can we say then but
[1:00:32] you see it's by true believers that he
[1:00:35] proves his word
[1:00:36] not by those who say they believe but
[1:00:39] those who really believe it's by his
[1:00:42] believing children that he proves his
[1:00:45] word
[1:00:46] i tell you it can't get any more simple
[1:00:48] god only asked us do you believe
[1:00:52] do you believe me because if it is that
[1:00:57] is where it comes down it is faith that
[1:01:00] comes down into the finished work of
[1:01:03] almighty god but many times friends what
[1:01:05] hinders the belief is we've got too many
[1:01:08] things still lingering and clogged up in
[1:01:11] our life
[1:01:14] so many times there's things that can be
[1:01:16] unconfessed sin it could be things that
[1:01:18] you're looking at and if there's just a
[1:01:20] slight little bit of reason the slight
[1:01:22] little bit of doubt he can't work upon
[1:01:25] that but when he can just come into this
[1:01:27] place to where you can just take god at
[1:01:30] his word and really settle it i mean
[1:01:32] speak it out that i doubt my doubts i
[1:01:35] i'm nothing without you lord i i can't
[1:01:38] lord i need your strength lord i need
[1:01:41] your work of grace in my life almighty
[1:01:44] god
[1:01:46] amen as a believer inviting his presence
[1:01:49] you can't figure this out
[1:01:52] one thing that i should do the greatest
[1:01:54] thing you can do is throw yourself into
[1:01:57] the arms of the living god
[1:02:01] brother braham said he had believers the
[1:02:02] old crop had died off the unbelievers
[1:02:04] who said we can't take it he let every
[1:02:07] one of them perish every one of them but
[1:02:09] the believers who was left
[1:02:12] moses had been taken to glory and the
[1:02:14] unbelievers had perished in the
[1:02:16] wilderness and this was their children
[1:02:18] there were only two that crossed over
[1:02:21] and that was the believers joshua and
[1:02:23] caleb and i was talking about from that
[1:02:24] original group they was the believers
[1:02:27] they was the one who crossed over i want
[1:02:29] you to watch how he says this it's the
[1:02:32] only way god can do it is by his
[1:02:35] believing children
[1:02:37] his believers was the one that done it
[1:02:40] he used them to cross over
[1:02:45] how did god cross over cross over in the
[1:02:49] fulfillment of his word he used
[1:02:52] believers to cross over him
[1:02:55] oh glory so what were the believers it
[1:02:58] was the word made manifest
[1:03:02] it was the word finding a place in the
[1:03:06] heart of the believer that was opening
[1:03:09] the way into the land of promise
[1:03:12] because what good would it do for god to
[1:03:15] go in the promised land without his
[1:03:17] people
[1:03:18] but you see god has ordained that going
[1:03:22] into that of the land the promises would
[1:03:24] be made manifest through the lives of
[1:03:27] his children oh my oh it's god coming
[1:03:32] down and dwelling in the hearts and
[1:03:34] lives of his people he used them to
[1:03:38] cross over with now he says he does it
[1:03:40] the same way in every age he does it
[1:03:43] every time by the same method he has to
[1:03:46] take believers and in order to have
[1:03:48] believers to meet that word he's got to
[1:03:51] predestinate it to that age
[1:03:56] now i realize when we talk about when
[1:03:58] we're looking at this notice he's got to
[1:04:00] predestinate this thing to be there to
[1:04:03] meet the challenge of the age it just
[1:04:06] everything it shows there is nothing by
[1:04:09] chance with god
[1:04:14] right
[1:04:16] god predestinated god predestinated just
[1:04:19] as much as mary would be there at that
[1:04:22] time she was a predestinated ordained
[1:04:26] channel for isaiah 9 6 and isaiah 7 14
[1:04:31] to be fulfilled through
[1:04:33] nothing made her a greater candidate
[1:04:36] though she maybe went to sunday school
[1:04:38] let's say she was there at sunday school
[1:04:40] she memorized all the scriptures one
[1:04:43] good but that is not predestination
[1:04:46] predestination takes it away from any
[1:04:50] human merit
[1:04:52] the bible says in romans chapter 9 that
[1:04:55] before jacob or esau either had done
[1:04:58] anything god said jacob have i loved
[1:05:01] esau have i hated
[1:05:04] why because we're talking about an
[1:05:06] almighty god who can see the end from
[1:05:09] the beginning and know what our attitude
[1:05:12] and our response would be to the word
[1:05:15] oh my
[1:05:17] predestinated for this moment
[1:05:23] there was millions
[1:05:25] as they stood there and they rejected to
[1:05:27] go over into the promised land
[1:05:30] but god knew there were two
[1:05:33] joshua and caleb
[1:05:37] that they
[1:05:38] would be those
[1:05:40] that he would cross over him
[1:05:43] god would take their lives simply
[1:05:45] because they believed him
[1:05:49] and you know what belief has to come
[1:05:51] from it's trust and you know how you get
[1:05:53] trust by love
[1:05:57] faith worketh by love
[1:06:01] he's got to predestinate this thing to
[1:06:04] be here to meet the challenge of the age
[1:06:06] let me go on
[1:06:07] he said oh brother brown said did you
[1:06:08] get that did you feel it did you see it
[1:06:10] did you understand it that's what's
[1:06:12] happening today he's predestinated it to
[1:06:15] this by four knowledge when he
[1:06:16] predestinated in malachi 4 it's got to
[1:06:19] happen when he come over and
[1:06:21] predestinates anything to happen in his
[1:06:23] word he had to prove his word to be so
[1:06:26] and when he predestinates anything to
[1:06:28] happen and says it will happen he knows
[1:06:31] that seed will be there at that time he
[1:06:35] predestinated a bride she's going to be
[1:06:38] there going to be a rapture she's going
[1:06:40] to be there he predestinated it by his
[1:06:43] foreknowledge there's nothing somebody
[1:06:46] say this with me
[1:06:47] nothing going to stop it
[1:06:53] god's predestinated it
[1:06:55] nothing's going to stop it
[1:06:59] i'll tell you what those ought to be
[1:07:00] some words that we put up on our phone
[1:07:03] or tag up on our our refrigerator or tag
[1:07:06] up on your mirror when you get
[1:07:07] discouraged this is something you ought
[1:07:10] to say nothing's going to stop it
[1:07:14] god's word cannot fail
[1:07:17] brother samuel i see this going this way
[1:07:19] i see so and so going this way nothing
[1:07:21] can stop god's word from coming to pass
[1:07:24] that's where the question listen don't
[1:07:26] get your eyes off remember remember
[1:07:29] there were people who got their eyes
[1:07:31] where the church started going over the
[1:07:32] hill they got their eyes off of looking
[1:07:36] unto jesus
[1:07:38] are you hearing me now
[1:07:40] you see it wasn't a big group that went
[1:07:42] into the land
[1:07:44] it was believers
[1:07:46] and believers are not made believers by
[1:07:49] believers believers are believers
[1:07:52] and they've been believers all along
[1:07:55] are you with me the holy ghost doesn't
[1:07:56] make you a believer you are already a
[1:07:58] believer
[1:08:00] but the holy ghost raises up that seed
[1:08:04] on the inside that's why there's got to
[1:08:06] be a new birth a new creation on the
[1:08:09] inside then it is a work of almighty god
[1:08:12] on the inside
[1:08:14] god predestinated it
[1:08:16] amen when we came here we dropped from
[1:08:18] our mother's womb that seed was there
[1:08:22] within us
[1:08:24] amen it's an ordained channel of god so
[1:08:27] let me just say it in this way because
[1:08:29] there's nothing going to stop it you
[1:08:31] know this is why brother branham you
[1:08:33] know him talk he was talking to a group
[1:08:35] of people in the message of thy house
[1:08:36] when he was preaching in georgia and
[1:08:38] they had some different ones i asked him
[1:08:40] brother brown if you believe the coming
[1:08:41] of the lord is so close how in the world
[1:08:43] can you go off and fish and hunt like
[1:08:45] this you seems like you ought to be
[1:08:46] going like a house on fire brother bram
[1:08:48] said i've come to realize
[1:08:50] there's only so many names on that book
[1:08:53] and he said you know what there's one
[1:08:54] that's that's who's going to be there
[1:08:57] and god it wasn't brother brown became
[1:08:59] likes about it but what brother brown
[1:09:01] was saying is is that there's to listen
[1:09:03] that i'm not going to make anybody else
[1:09:05] make it
[1:09:06] that isn't ordained to make it
[1:09:09] are you hearing me now but the one thing
[1:09:12] that we want to do is encouraging life
[1:09:14] sure we want to encourage hearts we've
[1:09:16] got loved ones but let's encourage the
[1:09:19] believers that are moving on into the
[1:09:22] promises of god
[1:09:24] i want to encourage every heart that if
[1:09:26] there's a life that has not made us
[1:09:27] stand yet that they'll make a stand on
[1:09:29] the word of god that the holy spirit
[1:09:31] would strike their hearts and strike
[1:09:34] their lives
[1:09:37] but the proving grounds of god's word
[1:09:40] is channels
[1:09:41] that god's ordained
[1:09:43] to receive the lord remember there were
[1:09:45] four kinds of
[1:09:46] ground right
[1:09:48] the seed that went out
[1:09:50] some was on stony ground
[1:09:53] right
[1:09:54] some some came up there was thorns and
[1:09:56] thistles that came up choked it out but
[1:09:58] there was one that was called
[1:10:01] good ground
[1:10:03] and brother branham over and over works
[1:10:05] as faith express then in the message the
[1:10:07] rapture he says that is free prepared
[1:10:10] ground
[1:10:12] god he said ordained you to receive him
[1:10:15] in this generation
[1:10:18] so the recognizing of god
[1:10:21] is by a part within you just like inside
[1:10:24] of your cell phone there's something to
[1:10:26] recognize when i punch in numbers and
[1:10:29] call you it don't go to somebody else it
[1:10:32] goes to your phone
[1:10:34] are you with me that's how when the word
[1:10:36] comes by it's already dialed into the
[1:10:39] word the word already has your name
[1:10:42] wrote into it the word already has that
[1:10:45] part of what you've been longing for
[1:10:48] what you've been searching for that
[1:10:50] other part that comes together
[1:10:54] you're the vessel that god will prove
[1:10:57] himself through
[1:10:58] the believers the instrument that god
[1:11:00] performs
[1:11:01] his paradox through god think about it
[1:11:04] in your life in my life
[1:11:07] our lives
[1:11:09] are those things are is that which god
[1:11:12] proves he's still a deliverer
[1:11:16] god proves he's still a healer
[1:11:18] i don't want to get sick nobody wants to
[1:11:20] get sick
[1:11:22] is that right
[1:11:23] nobody wants to have a
[1:11:24] disease but god will take those
[1:11:28] opportunities remember nothing can come
[1:11:31] our way unless god permitted
[1:11:33] and god will take situations
[1:11:36] that others would collapse
[1:11:38] others would walk away others say i'll
[1:11:41] tell you what i just can't do with this
[1:11:42] if god take this i'll serve him
[1:11:45] you never was there in the first place
[1:11:48] are you with me
[1:11:49] but god takes lives and he'll prove he's
[1:11:52] a healer he'll prove he's a deliverer
[1:11:55] he proves in this hour that he still
[1:11:58] feels with the holy ghost
[1:12:00] he's proving his word through believers
[1:12:04] is that right i would say it in this way
[1:12:07] we are ordained stones
[1:12:11] god has stones that are set forth as a
[1:12:15] testimony and a witness just as much as
[1:12:17] those stones had to be there in the
[1:12:19] jordan to be brought up
[1:12:23] we were ordained
[1:12:26] though covered over with sin and mock
[1:12:29] and everything but we were ordained as
[1:12:32] stones to be testimonies as memorials of
[1:12:36] god's grace
[1:12:39] say brother samuel what does this have
[1:12:40] to do with prayer everything in the
[1:12:42] world
[1:12:43] because you can stand as a memorial and
[1:12:45] say what whatsoever we ask in his name
[1:12:50] he said he'll do it he's still a healer
[1:12:52] he's still a deliverer he still feels
[1:12:55] with the holy ghost we're able to stand
[1:12:57] there upon the promises of god we've got
[1:13:00] an open communication with god
[1:13:04] ordained stones think about it like this
[1:13:06] remember when the pharisees i'm just
[1:13:08] gonna just move here just to
[1:13:10] capture all of this when it came john
[1:13:13] the baptist standing there on the river
[1:13:15] jordan baptizing think about it here he
[1:13:18] is standing on the river jordan where
[1:13:20] they had crossed when he saw many of the
[1:13:22] pharisees and sadducees come to his
[1:13:24] baptism he said unto them old generation
[1:13:27] of vipers who hath warned you to flee
[1:13:30] from the wrath to come
[1:13:31] bring forth therefore fruits meet for
[1:13:34] repentance and think not to say within
[1:13:38] yourselves we have abraham to our father
[1:13:41] for i say unto you that god is able of
[1:13:44] these stones to raise up children
[1:13:47] unto abraham
[1:13:50] what's john taking them back to he's
[1:13:52] taken them back to that crossing of the
[1:13:54] jordan
[1:13:55] that god's able to raise up stones
[1:13:58] if you're not going to recognize him and
[1:14:01] yield to him god will raise up stones
[1:14:05] god will take lives that that you
[1:14:07] wouldn't even suspect but if you won't
[1:14:09] yield to him god's got some people that
[1:14:11] will yield to him
[1:14:15] i love how brother graham says it like
[1:14:16] this he said no matter what man thinks
[1:14:18] god's got a program and it's going to be
[1:14:23] fulfilled
[1:14:25] i don't care how many doubters rise i
[1:14:27] don't care how many websites
[1:14:30] i don't care god's word cannot fail
[1:14:35] god's word is being fulfilled
[1:14:38] no matter how much how many devils rise
[1:14:41] and whatever they want to say whatever
[1:14:43] they want to do but god's word cannot be
[1:14:46] stopped
[1:14:48] let me just say
[1:14:49] believers can't be stopped
[1:14:53] because it's not greater it's me it's
[1:14:55] greater is he that is in me
[1:14:59] [Applause]
[1:15:00] cancer might come upon some but he can
[1:15:03] but satan can't stop him
[1:15:07] diseases and everything else trials can
[1:15:10] come around but it can't stop a real
[1:15:12] believer they were a believer before the
[1:15:14] test they were a believer before the
[1:15:17] trial they're a believer in the test a
[1:15:19] believer in the trial and they'll be a
[1:15:21] believer afterwards
[1:15:26] hallelujah god will cross right through
[1:15:28] cancer right through them
[1:15:34] oh glory be to god it's going to be
[1:15:37] fulfilled
[1:15:38] oh my there there are testimonies
[1:15:40] remember
[1:15:42] that even when paul could write
[1:15:44] what if men what if some did not believe
[1:15:48] think about it when jesus was standing
[1:15:51] there it wasn't just him they didn't
[1:15:53] believe noah
[1:15:56] is that right in isaiah 53 says he is
[1:16:00] despised and rejected
[1:16:02] it was christ in noah that was rejected
[1:16:07] when they ran noah down they weren't
[1:16:09] running noah down they were running down
[1:16:10] jehovah
[1:16:12] when they ran down jeremiah they weren't
[1:16:14] running down jeremiah they were running
[1:16:16] down jehovah
[1:16:19] when they ran down moses they were
[1:16:21] running down jehovah are you hearing me
[1:16:22] now
[1:16:24] they couldn't recognize it and see it
[1:16:26] but it was god veiled in men
[1:16:32] is that right
[1:16:33] and that's always where man stumbles is
[1:16:36] man seeing beyond the veil of man
[1:16:39] are you hearing me you and i it's just
[1:16:41] like the veil that we have it's why it
[1:16:44] takes something greater than our veil of
[1:16:46] our human mind our human intellect our
[1:16:48] human spirit there's got to be a divine
[1:16:51] connection down there on the inside that
[1:16:53] we recognize it's god that's speaking to
[1:16:56] my heart it's god oh friends do you
[1:16:58] realize tonight if you can hear the
[1:17:01] voice of god you are the richest people
[1:17:04] on the face of the earth
[1:17:08] to be able to hear his voice
[1:17:15] his voice is not a kentuckian
[1:17:18] his voice was in that voice
[1:17:21] but that voice that was there is now in
[1:17:24] bright form
[1:17:31] glory be to god
[1:17:33] oh so what if some did not believe did
[1:17:35] that stop god
[1:17:37] god didn't say oh wait a minute they're
[1:17:39] not believing no there was an ordained
[1:17:41] remnant as a matter of fact there was a
[1:17:43] handful
[1:17:45] simeon
[1:17:47] anna
[1:17:49] there was just a few brother brown said
[1:17:52] that was god's church
[1:17:56] a handful it wasn't a big mega church
[1:17:59] in the message birth things brother ran
[1:18:01] brings it out it was a handful of people
[1:18:07] but they were waiting on the fulfillment
[1:18:10] of god's word
[1:18:12] and god came to him
[1:18:15] is that right
[1:18:17] they were ordained while the rest of
[1:18:18] them were rejecting
[1:18:21] but it didn't make god's word of none
[1:18:22] effect
[1:18:24] god had some vessels on earth that his
[1:18:26] word
[1:18:27] could have preeminence in
[1:18:31] think of this
[1:18:32] brother let me just pull from a few
[1:18:34] places he said
[1:18:35] god's able of these stones to raise
[1:18:37] children to abraham
[1:18:39] he said if the pentecostals he said
[1:18:40] they're not willing to take it on god he
[1:18:42] said will rise up out of the lutherans
[1:18:44] god arrives up from here he's pulling
[1:18:46] out stones
[1:18:50] he said god's able of these stones to
[1:18:51] rise children to abraham somebody's
[1:18:54] going to see the vision and take it on
[1:18:57] i'm talking about a living memorial of
[1:19:00] his presence
[1:19:02] oh glory think of this
[1:19:06] you might be feeling a little bit low
[1:19:09] you might be feeling me
[1:19:12] who am i
[1:19:14] look at all my weaknesses look at all my
[1:19:16] frailties look at all my failures look
[1:19:18] at all my mistakes
[1:19:20] what do i have to offer god
[1:19:24] but god listen to me now god placed
[1:19:27] within you
[1:19:30] what he needs
[1:19:33] and all it requires for us is to offer
[1:19:36] back to him
[1:19:37] what he's placed within us
[1:19:40] because the very thing that we look at
[1:19:42] and say it would disqualify
[1:19:45] but god looks down into our lives and
[1:19:47] says but the qualification
[1:19:50] is by my word
[1:19:53] i want you just to look at this a moment
[1:19:54] familiar scriptures but let me read it
[1:19:57] god in first corinthians 1 27 god had
[1:20:00] chosen
[1:20:01] the foolish things of the world
[1:20:03] to confound the wise
[1:20:06] think about it god had a man by the name
[1:20:07] of peter he couldn't read his name on a
[1:20:09] boxcar
[1:20:11] and god would call him to preach
[1:20:14] the gospel
[1:20:15] he would be filled with the spirit of
[1:20:18] almighty god he would be given the keys
[1:20:21] unlocking
[1:20:23] that gospel there to the jews and to the
[1:20:25] gentiles and ignorant and unlearned men
[1:20:28] the bible said they took notice they
[1:20:31] were ignorant and unlearned
[1:20:35] is that right
[1:20:36] moses didn't believe he was qualified
[1:20:38] when he got in the presence of god i
[1:20:40] can't even talk straight lord i'm a man
[1:20:43] of a slow tongue
[1:20:45] but god chose him
[1:20:48] god didn't choose you or i because of
[1:20:50] our natural abilities
[1:20:53] god had chosen the foolish things of the
[1:20:55] world to confound the wise
[1:20:58] and god had chosen the weak things of
[1:21:00] the world to confound the things which
[1:21:02] are mighty and base things which are
[1:21:04] weak things of the world and things
[1:21:06] which are despised have god chosen yea
[1:21:08] and things which are not to bring to not
[1:21:10] those things that are that no
[1:21:13] flesh
[1:21:14] should glory in his presence
[1:21:18] it's god who raises up
[1:21:22] it's god who has raised us up it's not
[1:21:24] us
[1:21:26] but god remember god has provided you
[1:21:29] couldn't have been born in any other age
[1:21:34] is that right
[1:21:36] david said in one psalms 139
[1:21:39] that my members were wrote in thy book
[1:21:44] before i ever was
[1:21:47] god told jeremiah
[1:21:49] i knew you before you were in your other
[1:21:51] mother's womb
[1:21:53] and i ordained you to be a prophet
[1:21:57] glory be to god
[1:21:59] this is not haphazard
[1:22:02] amen calvary was not a haphazard event
[1:22:04] where god came down and thinking well i
[1:22:07] wonder if somebody's gonna serve me or
[1:22:09] not he came as a redeemer and a redeemer
[1:22:12] is to redeem what belongs to one
[1:22:17] amen predestination opens up that it's
[1:22:20] god it's a program this is not a program
[1:22:23] that's just hanging out here in balance
[1:22:25] this is grounded firmly in god
[1:22:32] oh glory be to god
[1:22:34] think about that even thinking back back
[1:22:36] to the message brother jerry had
[1:22:37] preached about the plans that god has
[1:22:39] laid down for me the purposes and
[1:22:41] sometimes things in our life we can't
[1:22:43] figure out why did i go this channel or
[1:22:45] what i go this or what i do this and
[1:22:47] sometimes things that we look off and
[1:22:48] say well that was a waste but yet we
[1:22:50] don't understand everything but one
[1:22:54] thing that we can look at is to know
[1:22:56] that there is a purpose and a plan that
[1:22:59] god has for my life
[1:23:04] sometimes god has to get this going this
[1:23:06] way this going this way and get this
[1:23:09] going this way sometimes god has to let
[1:23:11] you make decisions and then bring you
[1:23:13] back to a starting point just to let you
[1:23:16] know that he cares about you he loves
[1:23:19] you and that you belong to him
[1:23:23] you might escape and might get away but
[1:23:26] you can never get away from the mind of
[1:23:28] god
[1:23:31] god raises up and god
[1:23:33] god takes what he wants to take god
[1:23:35] didn't have to ask anybody can i take
[1:23:37] moses
[1:23:38] god didn't ask anybody can i take mary
[1:23:40] god didn't have to ask anybody can i
[1:23:42] take a stephen god never had to ask
[1:23:45] anybody they were ordained channels
[1:23:48] for god to prove his word through
[1:23:51] god's got children brother brahm said
[1:23:53] he's still jehovah gyra
[1:23:55] he said if he's got to pull him from the
[1:23:57] streets
[1:23:58] he's got to take him from prostitutes
[1:24:00] he said god will raise up children
[1:24:02] because he's still jehovah gyra he said
[1:24:05] god has provided himself a message he's
[1:24:07] provided a messenger and god will
[1:24:10] provide the signs and wonders in his
[1:24:12] church
[1:24:15] think about that predestinated seed
[1:24:17] in john 6.
[1:24:19] think about it brother aaron here she
[1:24:20] was coming down to the well she went
[1:24:22] down just like normal any other day
[1:24:25] but little did she know that that day
[1:24:27] in that moment
[1:24:29] it was going to be a time where a stone
[1:24:31] was going to be raised
[1:24:34] oh my there was one who came down there
[1:24:37] to seek for her she was buried beneath
[1:24:40] all the darkness
[1:24:42] but down within her life
[1:24:45] there was an ordained channel to receive
[1:24:49] god
[1:24:50] let me tell you something her life where
[1:24:53] nobody would let her come around at the
[1:24:55] well when they were there but that
[1:24:57] channel in her life when she
[1:25:00] met the messiah
[1:25:02] the living word
[1:25:04] the guide that could take her from death
[1:25:06] to life the god oh he didn't have to
[1:25:08] hold a seminar on how to be a real lady
[1:25:11] she met him
[1:25:13] and the god took her from a life where
[1:25:16] she was at into a real place as a real
[1:25:20] woman
[1:25:21] whose testimony lives and rings
[1:25:23] throughout the gospel
[1:25:26] think about mary magdalene whom seven
[1:25:28] spirits were cast out
[1:25:30] she was an ordained channel
[1:25:32] that god would manifest his word through
[1:25:35] think about it brother shane when simon
[1:25:37] called him there at his house to make
[1:25:39] fun of him
[1:25:40] jesus kept that appointment at that
[1:25:42] place
[1:25:43] because he knew she was coming
[1:25:47] that appointment was not about simon
[1:25:50] that appointment was because he knew she
[1:25:53] was going to be there
[1:25:56] it was all divinely arranged
[1:26:00] glory be to god think about the woman
[1:26:02] caught in adultery
[1:26:04] oh my think about the situation that was
[1:26:07] there and how they brought her in there
[1:26:10] but little what a situation
[1:26:13] oh that could it seemed and it was so
[1:26:16] vile but right there in the midst of
[1:26:18] that situation
[1:26:20] she was able to receive the forgiveness
[1:26:23] of the word
[1:26:25] and rise up without one accuser
[1:26:29] the word
[1:26:30] dismantled every accusation
[1:26:34] that was against her what was it the
[1:26:37] living word
[1:26:38] moving down in the jordan
[1:26:40] to open up the way
[1:26:43] think about when paul was in corinth i'm
[1:26:45] coming down
[1:26:47] i wonder how much how paul no doubt was
[1:26:50] maybe he got discouraged when he was
[1:26:52] there because god had to tell paul
[1:26:55] paul i want you to stay right here
[1:26:58] because i've got much people
[1:27:00] in this city
[1:27:02] they don't know they're my people
[1:27:04] but i know them
[1:27:07] they don't know they're my stones but i
[1:27:09] know them
[1:27:11] i've got them right here in this city
[1:27:13] they're covered over
[1:27:15] oh they're some of them thieves and
[1:27:17] everything let me just read it first
[1:27:18] corinthians 6 9 know you not that the
[1:27:21] unrighteous shall not inherit the
[1:27:22] kingdom of god be not deceived neither
[1:27:25] fornicators idolaters or adulterers
[1:27:28] effeminate you know that means sissies
[1:27:30] nor abusers of themselves with mankind
[1:27:32] nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards
[1:27:34] nor revilers nor extortioners shall
[1:27:37] inherit the kingdom of god and such
[1:27:41] were
[1:27:42] some of you
[1:27:45] glory be to god stones that have been
[1:27:48] raised up
[1:27:50] but ye are washed you are sanctified you
[1:27:54] are justified in the name of the lord
[1:27:56] jesus and by the spirit
[1:27:59] of our god
[1:28:00] no wonder paul could speak to the
[1:28:02] ephesians as they were coming into their
[1:28:04] land and you
[1:28:05] hath he quickened
[1:28:07] who were dead
[1:28:09] in sin and trespasses
[1:28:12] walked according to the prince of power
[1:28:14] of the air
[1:28:15] carried about with all sorts of things
[1:28:17] think about in this age
[1:28:21] when god had people
[1:28:24] who could stand and look
[1:28:27] at the message the word that god was
[1:28:29] vindicated
[1:28:31] and would make a statement
[1:28:34] and say i wouldn't have nothing to do
[1:28:35] with that
[1:28:37] or i wouldn't feed that religion to my
[1:28:39] cow
[1:28:43] think of that
[1:28:45] where people could say well brother
[1:28:47] brown is a prophet when the anointing's
[1:28:48] upon him and the signs and wonders but
[1:28:50] don't you listen to his teaching
[1:28:55] and don't realize that the signs and
[1:28:56] wonders were only to confirm
[1:28:59] the word
[1:29:02] it was to confirm the word
[1:29:05] it's the voice of god
[1:29:08] that we have been brought in contact
[1:29:10] with
[1:29:12] a man to hear the voice of almighty god
[1:29:14] speaking to our lives
[1:29:16] think about it brother branham would say
[1:29:18] like this he said god's able to rise up
[1:29:21] stones he said if people won't receive
[1:29:23] it he said god will raise up apostle
[1:29:27] and bring opossum in
[1:29:29] if people won't receive it god will
[1:29:31] bring up god will raise up a little
[1:29:33] fishy let me tell you something that's a
[1:29:36] powerful powerful testimony right there
[1:29:39] amen you think think of that of that
[1:29:41] possum where it was a situation think of
[1:29:44] it now
[1:29:45] that brother branham was instructed put
[1:29:47] it out of its mind
[1:29:51] it won't make it it'll never survive
[1:29:55] it was rolled off
[1:29:59] but nothing
[1:30:01] is beyond
[1:30:03] almighty god
[1:30:05] he's able to rise up stones
[1:30:09] that little fishy
[1:30:11] when brother dave said there in the boat
[1:30:13] he said i guess you shot your last wad
[1:30:17] but god raised up that little fishing
[1:30:19] its intrus was pulled out
[1:30:23] it was a situation and look it's beyond
[1:30:25] hope just write it off
[1:30:28] but not to god
[1:30:31] not to god
[1:30:33] let me tell you something your situation
[1:30:36] is not beyond god
[1:30:39] there is nothing beyond god
[1:30:42] your loved ones it's not beyond god your
[1:30:45] children it's not beyond god i don't
[1:30:48] care what they're tangled up in it's not
[1:30:50] beyond god
[1:30:53] brother samuel you don't know what they
[1:30:55] might have said but think of what
[1:30:57] brother branham could say in the message
[1:30:58] paradox he said you can take somebody
[1:31:00] consent in a meeting tonight and
[1:31:02] criticize the working of what's going on
[1:31:04] but you let god get a hold of their life
[1:31:06] he said he'll take him from a critic to
[1:31:08] a believer what is that the sovereignty
[1:31:10] and the grace of almighty god
[1:31:13] i'm telling you we're believers
[1:31:15] there's nothing impossible with god
[1:31:19] nothing impossible with god and as a
[1:31:21] believer
[1:31:22] there's nothing impossible with you
[1:31:27] when god's word requires it
[1:31:30] he raises up
[1:31:32] what's needed
[1:31:34] to meet that challenge
[1:31:36] think about a memorial you know as we as
[1:31:38] i close here
[1:31:40] many memorials that could be built
[1:31:43] and there are sometimes we go and we see
[1:31:45] different memorials and sometimes those
[1:31:47] memorials are nice to see just reminders
[1:31:49] and things that we can have in this
[1:31:51] nation and different things like that
[1:31:53] even of
[1:31:54] times you know in the past few years
[1:31:56] when i've been able to go down into
[1:31:58] jeffersonville and the places and
[1:32:00] they've taken me around i've really
[1:32:02] enjoyed just looking back and different
[1:32:04] memorials of places and just standing
[1:32:07] there and and just kind of beholding you
[1:32:09] know there's not really
[1:32:11] i we would say markers and things like
[1:32:14] that
[1:32:15] but you know
[1:32:16] man will always raise up a memorial
[1:32:19] to something that you can go and look at
[1:32:22] and
[1:32:22] and you know within that memorial though
[1:32:26] if there's not something that's really
[1:32:28] eternal behind it
[1:32:30] it's only something
[1:32:32] of this life
[1:32:36] but you know
[1:32:38] i think of it in this way
[1:32:40] brother brown would take the example of
[1:32:42] of elisha when
[1:32:44] that axe head
[1:32:46] flew off
[1:32:47] of that
[1:32:49] that stick when they those prophets went
[1:32:51] to build a memorial they were going to
[1:32:53] build a school
[1:32:56] and it fell off into the water
[1:32:58] and they came and asked elisha they said
[1:33:00] elisha we need help we got to recover
[1:33:02] this axe head
[1:33:04] now that's impossible for an axe head to
[1:33:07] come up out of the water
[1:33:10] right
[1:33:11] i mean
[1:33:12] you brothers that are fishermen you know
[1:33:14] in order to get sometimes the bait down
[1:33:16] in the water you got to put sinkers on
[1:33:18] it
[1:33:18] to get it to go down to where you want
[1:33:20] it certain levels
[1:33:22] but to think of an axe head
[1:33:25] where elisha would say
[1:33:27] give me the stick
[1:33:30] and he would place that stick
[1:33:32] much we could speak about that
[1:33:34] but that axe head rose up
[1:33:38] brother brahem said what elisha chose to
[1:33:40] do rather than more erect a memorial out
[1:33:43] here
[1:33:44] he chose a greater memorial
[1:33:47] where there would be something that was
[1:33:48] beneath the water something that was
[1:33:50] dead
[1:33:51] and it would be raised back into
[1:33:53] position
[1:33:54] back to its purpose
[1:33:57] and this is what god when he takes a
[1:33:59] life
[1:34:00] and god raises that life from beneath
[1:34:03] the muck
[1:34:04] the gum
[1:34:06] everything of this
[1:34:08] world in this earth and
[1:34:10] from sin
[1:34:12] and you know what
[1:34:13] your life becomes a memorial
[1:34:16] it becomes a testimony
[1:34:18] it doesn't mean that everything's always
[1:34:20] went your way it doesn't mean that our
[1:34:22] lives are free from tests and trials as
[1:34:24] a matter of fact the test and trials is
[1:34:26] what really proves
[1:34:28] and shows a memorial
[1:34:31] because the tests and trials
[1:34:33] is what proves
[1:34:35] whether the gold is real or not
[1:34:38] is that right
[1:34:39] because if something can't be tested
[1:34:42] then it really can't be trusted
[1:34:44] but a real remor memorial is something
[1:34:47] that it can stand there
[1:34:49] and when everything is said and done
[1:34:51] when it's all finished
[1:34:53] there's a memorial that can stand as a
[1:34:55] testimony not only now
[1:34:57] but it stands as
[1:34:59] this
[1:35:00] is a real believer
[1:35:03] not that everything is just fine and
[1:35:05] dandy but you know what in everything
[1:35:09] god is first
[1:35:11] are you hearing me now
[1:35:13] that that in no matter tests and trials
[1:35:15] you think about this week you can see
[1:35:18] lives and knowing that there's lives
[1:35:20] that have gone through tests and trials
[1:35:22] and things come our way things that you
[1:35:24] you cannot even explain
[1:35:28] but a memorial is one that can stand
[1:35:30] there as a testimony and you know what a
[1:35:32] more memorial does just as much as if
[1:35:34] you would go
[1:35:35] into those areas where they have
[1:35:37] memorials and it points to you know
[1:35:39] george washington crossing the valley
[1:35:40] forge and all those different things
[1:35:42] that delaware all those things like that
[1:35:44] it'll point to an event
[1:35:46] that's the same way a memorial does
[1:35:48] in our life
[1:35:50] it points to a living
[1:35:52] christ
[1:35:54] a living event
[1:35:57] so that when your children say
[1:36:01] what mean these stones
[1:36:04] you can say
[1:36:06] it's god
[1:36:07] what god did for me
[1:36:09] he's the same god for you
[1:36:12] he's the same yesterday
[1:36:14] today
[1:36:16] and forever
[1:36:18] it's a living memorial
[1:36:20] of the presence of almighty god
[1:36:23] oh my let's just pray
[1:36:26] heavenly father
[1:36:31] lord jesus
[1:36:34] nothing lord that
[1:36:36] could be greater

[1:36:40] that god that you
[1:36:42] would raise up lord
[1:36:44] out of lives and
[1:36:47] hearts oh god to be
[1:36:49] a testimony
[1:36:50] in this hour to be a witness oh god
