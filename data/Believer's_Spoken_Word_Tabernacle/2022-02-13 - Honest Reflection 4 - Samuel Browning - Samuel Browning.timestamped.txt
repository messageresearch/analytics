[33:33] amen so good to be in the house of the
[33:35] lord once again
[33:38] be honest with you i
[33:40] this morning i said oh my goodness i
[33:42] looked outside
[33:44] and
[33:46] some some of you maybe many of you
[33:47] didn't say about it so thank you lord
[33:50] i was starting to see grass i wanted to
[33:52] see more snow
[33:53] but i didn't want to see snow
[33:55] necessarily on sunday morning
[33:57] and it just came so quickly and you know
[34:00] sometimes people ask you they say
[34:02] you get much lake effect snow and i
[34:04] guess i really don't understand all that
[34:06] so well
[34:07] this is really lake effect snow right
[34:09] here
[34:10] i know when the boys were traveling home
[34:12] last night from the
[34:13] youth banquet there in
[34:16] findlay
[34:16] they called me his dad the
[34:19] the ice and
[34:20] so forth so they just they got on up the
[34:23] road just a little bit and everything
[34:25] cleared and it's clear on the way home
[34:27] but everything's just so patchy but i'm
[34:29] glad that god allowed us to be here
[34:31] today
[34:33] i'm glad he made a way
[34:35] you know
[34:36] you know brother branham would say it
[34:37] like this
[34:38] and um
[34:40] you know he didn't he doesn't rehear he
[34:42] didn't mention it in a way that we put
[34:44] our lives at risk we understand that
[34:46] everybody has to use wisdom it's just
[34:48] like this kind of weather here you have
[34:50] different ones that travel from the snow
[34:52] belt
[34:53] everywhere else you know
[34:54] and you always have to just use wisdom
[34:56] because there's times that things happen
[34:58] like this that we're not even expecting
[35:01] you know to get but
[35:02] we're not southerners
[35:05] we we know how to drive in the snow
[35:09] i have different brothers talk to me
[35:10] about that but
[35:12] you know brother branham just gives such
[35:14] an
[35:15] encouragement he speaks he says
[35:18] you take he said a family that'll drive
[35:19] through a snowstorm to be in church he
[35:21] said you watch god reward that
[35:24] i don't believe brother branham was
[35:26] saying if somebody said i don't know if
[35:27] i could drive through a snowstorm or not
[35:29] the point being made was is that
[35:32] if you don't let anything stop you
[35:35] a lot of things that could try to stop
[35:36] us a lot of things try to hinder us but
[35:39] he said god will reward that
[35:41] once you think of this here
[35:43] just reading this just yesterday morning
[35:45] it's going through some things and study
[35:48] brother brown was talking about how that
[35:50] even when he was a sinner he wasn't even
[35:52] serving the lord and he speaks very
[35:54] clearly how he pulled in the traps at
[35:57] midnight he said i wouldn't fish
[35:59] wouldn't hunt
[36:00] he said i wanted to honor the sabbath
[36:02] now
[36:03] the brown wasn't even he wasn't serving
[36:05] the lord
[36:06] he made this statement after it he says
[36:08] god
[36:09] honored that
[36:12] and you know it's just little things
[36:14] that you you and i
[36:16] god entrusts to us to do
[36:19] and you know when we'll say god just
[36:20] help me to be sensitive to what the
[36:22] things that i'm to do and just to do
[36:25] what god's asked us to do in his word
[36:27] god honors that
[36:29] we're not looking for something but we
[36:31] just want to we want to please the lord
[36:33] and to think god would take notice
[36:36] and he honored that that the prophet
[36:38] went around and he pulled in all of his
[36:40] traps at midnight he went out and did
[36:42] all of that so there wouldn't be
[36:43] anything caught on the sabbath day or on
[36:46] sunday
[36:48] and i just happen to believe that god
[36:49] honors
[36:50] every sacrifice
[36:52] how many is a witness of that
[36:54] god honors that
[36:56] he honors that
[36:57] amen so let's just here this morning we
[36:59] we want to take the um
[37:02] the special offering for the building
[37:04] project and i know some may not be here

[42:37] [Music]
[42:49] let's look into the word of the lord and
[42:52] we'll go right to haggai chapter one and
[42:54] i'm just going to read a few verses of
[42:56] scripture from there
[43:22] we want to just read a few verses of
[43:24] scripture
[43:35] magi chapter 1 verse 1 it says in the
[43:38] second year of darius
[43:41] the king in the sixth month
[43:44] and the first day of the month came the
[43:46] word of the lord
[43:48] by haggai the prophet unto zerubbabel
[43:51] the son of shatil governor of judah and
[43:54] to joshua the son of josedec the high
[43:56] priest saying
[43:58] thus speaketh the lord of hosts saying
[44:00] this people say
[44:03] the time has not come
[44:05] the time that the lord's house should be
[44:08] built
[44:10] aren't you grateful for the word of the
[44:11] lord that comes to discern
[44:13] our hearts
[44:15] i'm glad it really comes to discern our
[44:17] hearts
[44:19] in verse 3
[44:20] then came the word of the lord by haggai
[44:23] the prophet saying
[44:25] is it time for you
[44:27] o ye to dwell in your sealed houses
[44:30] and this house lie waste
[44:33] now therefore thus saith the lord of
[44:35] hosts consider
[44:36] your ways
[44:38] you have sown much
[44:40] and bring in little
[44:42] you eat
[44:43] but you have not enough
[44:46] you drink
[44:47] but you are not filled with drink you
[44:50] clothed
[44:51] but there is none warm
[44:53] and he that earneth wages earneth wages
[44:57] to put it into a bag with holes
[45:00] thus saith the lord of hosts consider
[45:04] your ways
[45:06] go up to the mountain
[45:08] and bring wood and build the house and i
[45:11] will take pleasure in it and i will be
[45:14] glorified saith the lord
[45:16] you looked for much
[45:18] and lo it came to little
[45:21] when you brought it home
[45:23] i did blow up on it
[45:24] why
[45:25] saith the lord of hosts because of mine
[45:29] house that is waste and you run every
[45:32] man to his own house
[45:34] therefore the heaven over you
[45:37] is stayed from dew and the earth is
[45:39] stayed from her fruit
[45:41] and i called for a drought upon the land
[45:44] and upon the mountains
[45:46] and upon the corn and upon the new wine
[45:48] and upon the oil
[45:50] upon that which the ground bringeth
[45:52] forth and upon men and upon cattle and
[45:55] upon all the labor
[45:57] of the hands
[46:00] you know to the natural eye
[46:03] and just a carnal understanding
[46:06] it would just seem like
[46:08] why
[46:10] but this is the mercy and the love
[46:13] of almighty god
[46:15] this is god's love this is god's mercy
[46:18] to his children
[46:20] amen may god bless your word as you're
[46:22] being seated
[46:24] i want to continue to speak on this
[46:26] thought that the lord has inspired us
[46:29] here some weeks ago
[46:31] on honest reflections and i
[46:34] we could continue to title every service
[46:36] that way really
[46:38] because that's really what our lives
[46:41] what the word of god is intended for
[46:44] is that we would be able to really take
[46:46] account of our lives and really reflect
[46:50] we've
[46:51] we've not come here
[46:54] really when we gather together like this
[46:56] we we think of it brother branham
[46:58] wouldn't say it over and over he says
[47:00] you know we come and we worship and we
[47:02] sing songs he said but the main purpose
[47:04] that we come here this is the house of
[47:06] correction
[47:08] is it's a place where the word of god is
[47:10] to go forth
[47:12] and we
[47:13] with understanding that there's a
[47:15] there's a burden and there's a desire
[47:17] within our heart to walk pleasing to the
[47:20] lord
[47:21] and we're aware of the promises that
[47:24] apply to us and to this hour
[47:27] you see we're not a people that are just
[47:30] saying we believe that the lord is
[47:31] coming back
[47:33] because you can speak to many different
[47:36] individuals that could be into other uh
[47:40] denomination it could be in
[47:41] denominations and so forth and you'll
[47:42] hear many of them saying oh the things
[47:45] are getting bad and i tell you the lord
[47:47] is coming back soon they believe that
[47:50] let me say it like this
[47:52] there is a way into that preparation
[47:55] just as much as in his first coming
[47:58] there had to be a preparation for that
[48:01] first coming
[48:02] and god sent a message
[48:05] by the way
[48:06] of john the baptist john was the one
[48:08] that was identified in the scripture
[48:10] prepare ye the way of the lord
[48:13] that whole thing prepare you the way of
[48:15] the lord it's like going down a roadway
[48:17] and if there was boulders and everything
[48:19] else in that roadway this is the path
[48:21] the king is coming
[48:23] so if there's things in the way they
[48:25] need to be moved out of the way because
[48:27] he's coming this way
[48:29] and so god came in this hour
[48:32] and god has
[48:33] to overthrow creeds and dogmas and
[48:36] everything that would hinder and the
[48:39] real hindrance is that god coming by his
[48:42] word and bringing such an illumination
[48:45] that those things in our life we can
[48:48] recognize that by the grace of god and
[48:50] that our lives be cleared out because
[48:52] after all
[48:54] it is that pathway that god has come to
[48:57] speak to
[48:58] you see many many in that day they were
[49:01] religious and when john came on the
[49:03] scene many of them came and asked him
[49:05] are you here are you he
[49:07] many of them came religious in that day
[49:10] and they didn't repent at all
[49:12] and gee remember john said why are you
[49:14] coming out here and you know why have
[49:17] you come out and you see the purpose
[49:19] that they came was just to see what's
[49:21] going on
[49:22] they weren't it wasn't something that
[49:24] was yearning or drawing or pulling them
[49:28] of life calling to life
[49:30] and so the real pathway was not going to
[49:33] be through their life but there was a
[49:36] group of people believers lives that
[49:39] were upon the earth in that moment that
[49:43] there were those who were waiting like
[49:45] anna simeone but i also want to remind
[49:48] you that there were others like peter
[49:51] there were others like the woman at the
[49:53] well
[49:54] come on that would not have been people
[49:56] that everybody wanted to associate with
[49:58] let me say this their life what god had
[50:02] reserved that part of the word was a
[50:05] pathway that god was going to come
[50:07] through
[50:08] and so god works by his word to make get
[50:11] that pathway cleared out this is why
[50:14] when the prophet when he would speak the
[50:17] message greatest battle ever fought and
[50:19] he's dealing with getting the battle
[50:22] stopped on the inside first get that war
[50:25] get that victory on the inside then
[50:28] you've got the strength of that victory
[50:30] to fight every other battle that comes
[50:33] your way you've got you've got that
[50:36] which cannot be overcome because the one
[50:38] now inside of you is the one who
[50:40] triumphed over every principality
[50:44] over everything of death hell in the
[50:46] grave so no matter what would come your
[50:48] way you have greater receive that is in
[50:50] you than he that's in the world
[50:53] and this is why john would write
[50:55] whosoever is born of god overcometh the
[50:57] world and this is the victory even our
[51:00] faith
[51:01] and that faith in our life it's not
[51:03] really our faith that faith is the faith
[51:06] of the son of god
[51:08] just hear the prophet this week and he
[51:10] places it so clearly he says that faith
[51:13] that is within you that is the holy
[51:15] ghost so the holy ghost is the faith of
[51:18] god operating through our life
[51:22] i tell you greater is he that is in us
[51:25] that gives me strength that gives me
[51:27] that really gives me courage so the
[51:30] pathway and i bring it back to this
[51:32] place here here you and i are and we see
[51:36] the promise
[51:37] you know first corinthians 15 first
[51:40] thessalonians 4 but god reserved until
[51:44] this time
[51:45] to open
[51:47] that the pathway that preparation
[51:50] into the rapture condition he promised
[51:54] he would send malachi 4 the prophet in
[51:57] this hour and i want you to perk up here
[51:59] if you're wondering and you say why is
[52:01] it that god would have to send a prophet
[52:04] it's when men
[52:06] lose sight of the living god and though
[52:09] they can carry the word they get away
[52:11] from the word of the lord
[52:13] they get away from the reality of the
[52:16] living god let me just say something to
[52:18] you and i we know this when we get in
[52:20] the presence of almighty god it brings
[52:23] conviction it causes us to search our
[52:26] lives because the word alone you know
[52:29] there's things we can read in the
[52:31] scripture and it can speak to our lives
[52:34] but think about it in his presence and
[52:36] as we walk in his presence daily then
[52:39] when you open the bible then when you're
[52:41] listening to the message you're not a
[52:43] stranger you are in fellowship with him
[52:46] and you're fellowshipping even as you're
[52:48] listening to the message as you're
[52:50] reading in the scriptures as you're in
[52:52] prayer as you're meditating you're
[52:54] walking with him and fellowshipping with
[52:57] him and there is reflection that comes
[52:59] into our life
[53:01] to bring conviction there's things that
[53:03] we can it can come into our lives and
[53:05] we're asking god to forgive us and we're
[53:07] not sitting in a church service
[53:10] are you hearing me but you see all of
[53:12] these things work together
[53:14] all of them work together
[53:16] according to god's great plan and
[53:19] program
[53:20] so the way back for preparation it would
[53:22] be just like you know i don't know if
[53:24] you've ever uh
[53:26] watched how they do the preparation for
[53:28] the uh the astronauts and things like
[53:31] that but uh you know when i was young
[53:34] real little i didn't like the rides at
[53:36] cedar point i i hated heights i still
[53:39] really don't like heights
[53:41] you know but i'll do it because there's
[53:43] fuzzy things with antlers that come by
[53:45] that's pretty good
[53:47] but i don't like heights
[53:49] but i really didn't like those rides
[53:53] so one day you know here we are there at
[53:55] cedar point i'm getting somewhere
[53:58] we get into this we go into this imax
[54:00] theater that's there
[54:02] and they're playing this space you know
[54:04] how they train astronauts now if you've
[54:05] never been in one of the imax theaters
[54:07] it's one of those things like wraps
[54:08] around just like that and i i'm standing
[54:10] here i thought they got me on a ride
[54:13] there was things going on inside of that
[54:15] with that space training and you're
[54:17] jumping back oh you know my seat was
[54:19] rocking and because the training that
[54:21] they have to go through
[54:24] and there is such rigor that they have
[54:27] to do and there's a narrowing down the
[54:30] training they're going through there's a
[54:32] narrowing down in that training when
[54:34] initially starts with applicants and
[54:36] people that are coming there's a
[54:38] narrowing down it might start ever so
[54:40] big but it narrows down
[54:44] when jesus was here there was a
[54:46] multitude following him but after just
[54:49] one service
[54:51] 70 walked away
[54:54] and they said this is too hard
[54:59] they couldn't understand it
[55:01] but you know what the elect didn't
[55:04] understand it
[55:05] but they believed it
[55:08] they knew who they were in the presence
[55:10] of and that was enough
[55:12] you see it wasn't you our understanding
[55:15] our belief is not something that you
[55:17] can't explain as a believer
[55:21] you're a believer not because you
[55:23] understand it or can explain it you're a
[55:25] believer because you believe and god
[55:29] ordains you to believe
[55:34] and there's something that you could
[55:36] believe in this you know wherever that
[55:39] god would begin to deal with your life
[55:41] but there was a longing because you were
[55:44] ordained to be a part of the body of
[55:48] jesus christ the bride of jesus christ
[55:50] it's not taking away from all of those
[55:52] that are out there but there was a
[55:54] special calling upon your life that you
[55:57] could not be satisfied with just the
[56:00] things of just being around a church
[56:03] that's why even coming to this church
[56:05] there must be a longing in your life
[56:07] that it's got to be more than just being
[56:10] associated with the message or i know
[56:12] that god sent a prophet it's got to be
[56:15] something that's in your heart that
[56:17] there's a uniting there's a drawing
[56:19] there's a calling you say brother samuel
[56:22] how do i know that she examine your own
[56:24] life there's a desire that i am longing
[56:27] for reality
[56:32] there's a lot of things out there to be
[56:33] offered that could uh seemingly try to
[56:37] satisfy or appease the natural man but
[56:40] this way in this hour we're not just
[56:43] looking at uh you know all the rapture
[56:46] is coming upon us we right here in this
[56:49] hour god has kept a promise that he made
[56:53] in this hour he's jehovah jiren
[56:58] the same lamb of god that walked here on
[57:02] the shores of galilee that was ascended
[57:05] on high sent back the holy ghost in its
[57:07] fullness he promised i will restore i
[57:11] will restore what that early church had
[57:14] there at pentecost i will restore it
[57:17] wherein the fullness that i walk inside
[57:20] of my body he promised that
[57:24] and the same lamb that was there is the
[57:27] same lamb that's here right with us
[57:30] we're not here on a part of a lamb only
[57:33] on a portion of a lamb john said i
[57:36] turned to sea

[57:41] one that spake with me when he's hearing
[57:43] a voice as a trumpet there in
[57:45] revelations 5 john weep not for the lion
[57:49] of the tribe of judah has prevailed to
[57:51] take the book
[57:53] and to loose the seals thereof no wonder
[57:56] the prophet could say in this manner it
[57:59] is one of the most sublime acts why he's
[58:02] already paid for this book he's already
[58:06] paid the price the title deed it's
[58:08] already been settled of eternal life are
[58:11] you with me now he's coming now to take
[58:14] that book because there is a need for a
[58:17] change upon this earth every facet of
[58:20] this is promised to come in to the final
[58:23] stages of redemption for this earth for
[58:26] there shall be a millennium there shall
[58:29] be a future home and god has prepared
[58:33] the way for
[58:34] himself and you are part of that way
[58:40] what grace is given to us in this hour
[58:44] we're not just looking where many of the
[58:46] christendom is looking for oh i'm
[58:48] looking for him to come in the sky we
[58:50] realized well we're there they're
[58:52] looking for that but remember his coming
[58:55] right now this right now is the coming
[58:58] of the lord where he's coming in the
[59:00] fullness of his spirit
[59:03] is that right revelations 10 1 the
[59:05] mighty angel descended that is the holy
[59:08] ghost himself the angel of the lord he's

[59:13] coming to his temple
[59:18] hallelujah secret coming

[59:22] secret coming and he's coming to his
[59:24] temple to take his abode what is his
[59:27] temple his temple is his word you are a
[59:30] part of his word he's coming to raise up
[59:33] his word in our lives
[59:38] well glory be to god it's his working
[59:41] and we are a part of that working
[59:47] hallelujah
[59:49] this isn't even nowhere near where i'm
[59:50] going
[59:54] but it's right on where he wants to go
[59:59] privilege and desire we're not we're not
[1:00:02] we recognize that preparation has come
[1:00:04] to us right now
[1:00:07] right now
[1:00:09] is this time of preparation
[1:00:12] the confidence that god brings by his
[1:00:14] word
[1:00:15] calling us under the blood not calling
[1:00:17] us to a church calling us under the
[1:00:19] blood
[1:00:20] calling us to a real token life that's
[1:00:23] the mercy and love of almighty god
[1:00:27] now
[1:00:28] let me try to approach here the subject
[1:00:30] here
[1:00:33] this morning
[1:00:36] i i guess we could say that now as it
[1:00:38] just moves in upon me
[1:00:40] these people these believers that we're
[1:00:43] reading about
[1:00:45] they were not people
[1:00:47] who had started
[1:00:48] on their own
[1:00:50] without a vision they cannot come back
[1:00:52] sister surely god bless you
[1:00:55] good to see you
[1:00:56] we have not they had not come back into
[1:00:58] the land
[1:01:00] of the you know i think that's a good
[1:01:01] idea they weren't back there by that
[1:01:04] this was prophecy
[1:01:07] there were events taking place
[1:01:11] prophecy
[1:01:13] was there being interpreted in these
[1:01:15] events
[1:01:17] daniel had said as we read last week to
[1:01:19] refer back to that it would be
[1:01:21] troubleless times but you know it's just
[1:01:23] like this with our walk as a believer we
[1:01:26] realize i remember realizing you know as
[1:01:28] a young boy you hear about the
[1:01:29] persecution you're about tests we hear
[1:01:31] about trials but that's not the focus of
[1:01:33] serving god
[1:01:35] i mean it's just like somebody's saying
[1:01:37] oh you don't want to get married man i
[1:01:38] tell you marriage you know there's all
[1:01:39] kinds of trials you know this or that or
[1:01:42] you need to talk to somebody else
[1:01:45] sure does test and try but that's not
[1:01:48] the theme of it
[1:01:51] i think of what ruth bell graham what
[1:01:53] she wrote
[1:01:55] like this she said i wrote a diary
[1:01:57] regarding my sons
[1:01:59] and she called it the prodigals
[1:02:02] ruth bell grand brother billy graham's
[1:02:04] wife she said i wrote it down and i'm
[1:02:06] glad i did she said because when i began
[1:02:08] to go back and read concerning things i
[1:02:11] didn't remember it except i had wrote it
[1:02:14] down
[1:02:15] you see that's if that happens there in
[1:02:17] the natural how much more within our
[1:02:20] lives we're not focused upon oh
[1:02:22] persecution's going to come because if
[1:02:24] that's your focus you'll never go
[1:02:26] anywhere
[1:02:28] you'll stay away you won't give any
[1:02:30] confession to nobody
[1:02:33] but it begins with a confession that
[1:02:36] god has touched my life
[1:02:38] god has changed my life i'm a different
[1:02:41] person now
[1:02:43] don't let the devil silence that voice
[1:02:48] hallelujah
[1:02:49] you find that how this is not even the
[1:02:51] focus when they came back to the land
[1:02:54] that wasn't even the focus the focus was
[1:02:57] we've been inspired and directed by god
[1:03:00] to come back into the land and to build
[1:03:03] the temple of almighty god we've been
[1:03:05] commissioned by god what god spoke
[1:03:08] regarding in isaiah what he spoke in
[1:03:10] jeremiah we are part of that prophecy
[1:03:18] but this part that we read right here
[1:03:22] is the same people
[1:03:25] and as i told you here before or have
[1:03:27] said it just as going through this and
[1:03:30] just trying to just just take it in
[1:03:33] there's not a person that's here
[1:03:36] and i don't care
[1:03:38] where you're at in your walk with the
[1:03:40] lord i don't care how many years you've
[1:03:42] been serving the lord
[1:03:44] everyone comes through times
[1:03:47] of weariness and discouragement
[1:03:51] every one of us come through moments of
[1:03:53] things that we're trying to make sense
[1:03:55] of what's going on around us
[1:03:59] but we try to
[1:04:01] and yet
[1:04:02] sometimes the way we try to make sense
[1:04:04] of it
[1:04:05] is we try to do it by our own reasoning
[1:04:09] and any time you could we can just take
[1:04:11] this to the bank and cash it anytime we
[1:04:14] try to walk by our own reasoning
[1:04:16] we fail right there
[1:04:20] there's a lot of thoughts that can come
[1:04:21] into our mind let me just tell you
[1:04:23] something everything that crosses your
[1:04:24] mind
[1:04:25] is not
[1:04:27] godly
[1:04:29] oh blessed i don't have no wicked no no
[1:04:31] i'm saying everything that crosses your
[1:04:33] mind is not godly
[1:04:35] even the things that you've entertained
[1:04:37] so and so might think this about me
[1:04:40] so-and-so might be this well i wonder if
[1:04:42] everything that comes through your mind
[1:04:44] is not godly
[1:04:47] let me say it like this let's say even
[1:04:49] if it is so
[1:04:51] we want to say i'll take the other
[1:04:53] approach
[1:04:56] are you hearing me
[1:04:57] because if not
[1:04:59] it affects
[1:05:01] our life
[1:05:03] our walk with god
[1:05:06] now i want to just deal with this here
[1:05:07] just a little bit can you turn with me
[1:05:09] in the bible to hebrews chapter 12.
[1:05:12] and i want to just deal with here just a
[1:05:14] little bit
[1:05:16] this morning if the lord would help us
[1:05:17] and just give us just a few moments
[1:05:22] and i want to just
[1:05:24] be able to deal with the part and
[1:05:26] looking at the chastening of the lord
[1:05:30] and i want to look at that because we
[1:05:32] hear that word and as bible readers and
[1:05:34] and believers we hear that word
[1:05:38] and we want to just we want to look into
[1:05:41] this here just a moment so if we can
[1:05:43] read from verse 5 here
[1:05:45] here paul is writing this admonition he
[1:05:47] says have you forgotten the exhortation
[1:05:49] which speaketh unto you as unto children
[1:05:52] my son despise not thou
[1:05:55] the chastening of the lord nor faint
[1:05:58] when thou art rebuked of him
[1:06:02] and what god see when god begins to deal
[1:06:05] with the life each of our lives
[1:06:08] he begin to speak and there begin the
[1:06:11] chastening of the lord correcting things
[1:06:13] in our life
[1:06:14] things that we were giving ourselves to
[1:06:16] it could sit in a meeting and he's and
[1:06:18] he's dealing with dress he's dealing
[1:06:20] with how that sisters are to dress how
[1:06:22] brothers ought to dress how husbands
[1:06:24] ought to treat their wives wives and so
[1:06:26] forth and he's dealing with just
[1:06:28] everything and getting down to
[1:06:30] sin
[1:06:33] he has to he deals with things that gets
[1:06:35] down to you see what god comes down to
[1:06:37] deal with is things that know a person
[1:06:40] can say i'm a pretty good fellow i'm a
[1:06:42] pretty good guy i love the lord but the
[1:06:45] word of god comes down to expose and say
[1:06:49] but these works that are coming out
[1:06:51] don't testify with what you're saying
[1:06:54] and he doesn't come in that way to
[1:06:56] condemn us he comes to rebuke to bring
[1:07:00] chastening to do what so we know where
[1:07:02] we're wrong
[1:07:04] if you're working on a factory and you
[1:07:06] you have to make this part for let's say
[1:07:08] four trucks well if you're doing it
[1:07:10] wrong something needs to be calibrated
[1:07:12] on that machine or on the pumps brother
[1:07:14] keener something has to be calibrated if
[1:07:17] you see something coming down the line
[1:07:19] and say hey wait a minute here
[1:07:20] something's off
[1:07:24] well what's off i mean we're churning
[1:07:25] out the parts no something's off
[1:07:28] something needs to be retooled or
[1:07:31] recalibrated something needs to be
[1:07:34] looked at
[1:07:36] not just keep on passing it down and
[1:07:38] that's how the holy spirit comes and he
[1:07:41] deals with our life all along he's
[1:07:44] looking in our life because there's
[1:07:45] things sometimes that can get out of
[1:07:47] sync there's things when the preaching
[1:07:49] of the word goes forth it brings to our
[1:07:51] realization wait a minute here there's
[1:07:53] things that's just not lining up with
[1:07:55] the word of god
[1:07:58] now this is where verse 5 says faint not
[1:08:00] faintly oh there's no use even trying
[1:08:06] hey
[1:08:06] hey
[1:08:07] hey
[1:08:08] we're not we're not we're not we're not
[1:08:10] dealing with somebody who's flesh and
[1:08:11] blood
[1:08:13] i'm talking about one right now who
[1:08:14] loves us who cares about us and who has
[1:08:17] the strength that's needed to bring into
[1:08:20] our lives and bring that correction what
[1:08:23] needs to take place in our life
[1:08:28] don't faint when don't run away don't
[1:08:30] well i'm just going to stay away from
[1:08:32] church or i'm going to do this and don't
[1:08:33] faint when thou art rebuked
[1:08:36] for whom the lord
[1:08:39] loveth
[1:08:40] he chasteneth and scourgeth every son
[1:08:43] whom he receiveth
[1:08:46] now this is what he does to whom he
[1:08:48] loves
[1:08:50] now let me just say it like this god's
[1:08:52] not sitting around
[1:08:55] who can i chastise
[1:08:58] no
[1:09:01] god this isn't how he works
[1:09:02] but his love for us
[1:09:05] is for his word
[1:09:07] that he will not allow us
[1:09:09] to get off course without correcting us
[1:09:15] and and he sees that there are things
[1:09:19] that need to arise in our life or come
[1:09:22] at us and he permits
[1:09:27] he permits keep that thought in line he
[1:09:30] permits
[1:09:31] satan to come he permits satan to come
[1:09:34] with these things and all some of those
[1:09:36] things are necessary for the molding in
[1:09:39] our life brother brown would say it in
[1:09:41] this manner and i'm trying to just i
[1:09:42] want to just lay this in very clearly
[1:09:45] this morning he says the trials come to
[1:09:48] take the slowness out of us
[1:09:52] i mean friends let's just be honest
[1:09:53] we're still walking in these flesh
[1:09:55] bodies
[1:09:56] and god's provide here at tester trial
[1:09:58] he permits satan to bring our way to do
[1:10:02] what get slowness out of us because we
[1:10:04] can get a little slow in the things we
[1:10:06] become commonplace in the things of the
[1:10:09] lord and god will allow a tester trial
[1:10:12] to take the slowness
[1:10:14] out of our life he's not working against
[1:10:17] us
[1:10:18] he's for us
[1:10:22] but the correction that the correction
[1:10:24] that will come in our life it's just
[1:10:26] like things that you can see among your
[1:10:29] children
[1:10:30] that sometimes there's things they have
[1:10:32] to go through
[1:10:35] things they have to face
[1:10:38] there's adversities they must face it's
[1:10:40] part of the molding of character as well
[1:10:43] as the time that we sat down with them
[1:10:45] and we speak about certain things things
[1:10:47] of that pertaining to the season of life
[1:10:49] they're in now what you're doing now
[1:10:51] decisions now will affect here later
[1:10:53] there's things all of that must be taken
[1:10:55] care of in the season
[1:10:59] but there's things like i could tell you
[1:11:00] that you know one of one of my one of
[1:11:02] our boys there had went into a job
[1:11:06] and one of the jobs where he was at oh
[1:11:10] you know
[1:11:11] coming home and pouring the heart out
[1:11:13] and what was going on there i'll be
[1:11:15] honest with you
[1:11:16] let's just let's just take the jacket
[1:11:18] off and be honest
[1:11:20] my dander got a little riled in a
[1:11:22] christian way
[1:11:28] come on now don't you know don't sit in
[1:11:30] that pious and everything else i know
[1:11:32] you all
[1:11:35] but as i sat right there i had to bite
[1:11:38] my tongue because i felt like going down
[1:11:41] and saying who do i need to talk to
[1:11:50] but to recognize and i pray god help me
[1:11:53] because you know why this is not gonna
[1:11:55] be the last time that he's gotta face
[1:11:57] this right
[1:11:59] i don't care where you're working at i
[1:12:01] don't care what you're dealing with
[1:12:02] you're still gonna deal with people
[1:12:05] that's why people think
[1:12:06] going from this child to this y'all whoo
[1:12:09] glory i'm in green pastures now no
[1:12:11] there's rotten people there just like
[1:12:12] there were rotten people there
[1:12:15] and many times the problem oh boy we're
[1:12:17] going to preach now the problem ain't
[1:12:19] the people the problem is you
[1:12:22] whoo
[1:12:24] come on friends we'd have to look in an
[1:12:25] honest reflection if we keep having the
[1:12:28] same problems it's not the problems out
[1:12:31] there god's trying to say there's some
[1:12:34] things that need to be worked out of
[1:12:36] your life
[1:12:39] oh god say my co-worker's here god
[1:12:41] changed my boss over here god do this
[1:12:42] over here god do this over here god do
[1:12:45] this over here god said i put you there
[1:12:47] to mold you and shape you
[1:12:52] like brother banham asked god i think
[1:12:54] it's in the mess in the adoption series
[1:12:55] he was praying asking god lord i just
[1:12:57] want to go on
[1:12:58] and the holy spirit spoke back to him
[1:13:00] and said are you trying to dodge your
[1:13:02] trials
[1:13:05] see to me
[1:13:07] that clarity that
[1:13:09] transparency in the prophet's life i can
[1:13:11] identify with that
[1:13:13] because every one of us could be there
[1:13:15] every one of us can say you know what i
[1:13:16] just want to go ahead and go on home who
[1:13:18] wouldn't want to go and be with the lord
[1:13:21] but i don't want to walk around here
[1:13:24] with you know where i have to pick up my
[1:13:25] lips to step up stairs and everything
[1:13:27] else god never made us to be that way
[1:13:34] oh my
[1:13:35] i feel like i've just got a whole arcade
[1:13:37] in front of me now how am i going where
[1:13:39] do i go lord
[1:13:41] the bible says happy is the people who's
[1:13:45] god is the lord
[1:13:51] hallelujah or many other scriptures that
[1:13:53] we can go into there's a place to draw
[1:13:55] real happiness from a place to draw real
[1:13:58] strength from but i want you to notice
[1:14:01] this chastening notice in verse 7 if you
[1:14:04] endure chastening notice endure it
[1:14:08] endure it
[1:14:12] god deal with you as with sons for what
[1:14:14] son is he whom the father chasteneth not
[1:14:18] i think of
[1:14:19] the one
[1:14:20] son that came back and told me he said
[1:14:22] you know what i'm glad
[1:14:24] i'm glad that i stuck that out
[1:14:27] i'm glad
[1:14:28] i'm glad i stuck it out
[1:14:31] i was really glad too
[1:14:35] are you hearing me this morning
[1:14:37] this is right down with what goes in the
[1:14:38] lunchbox
[1:14:41] there's things sometimes that you you
[1:14:43] and i our flesh hear me now
[1:14:46] you think in our flesh think of this
[1:14:48] when god stood in the midst of the seven
[1:14:51] golden candlesticks and he's looking
[1:14:53] there in that sumerian age the age of
[1:14:56] bitterness
[1:14:58] age or organization was taking
[1:15:01] precedence and here god stands with two
[1:15:04] words in the midst of all their
[1:15:06] tribulations and he says i
[1:15:09] know
[1:15:12] i know
[1:15:14] i know what you're going through i know
[1:15:20] yes sir
[1:15:21] brethren now he said for the the
[1:15:24] untutored
[1:15:25] untrained believer they would think that
[1:15:29] it just ought to be as soon as
[1:15:30] something's taking place that god just
[1:15:33] steps right in and skims the tide you
[1:15:35] see every time we're looking for the
[1:15:38] same the same experience
[1:15:40] as the red sea
[1:15:43] are you hearing me now
[1:15:44] instead of looking for the same god
[1:15:48] look for the same god
[1:15:50] he's always the same his characteristics
[1:15:52] his nature has never changed
[1:15:58] when they went through the land and
[1:15:59] taking every city in the land every city
[1:16:02] the way they took it was
[1:16:05] it different different it wasn't all of
[1:16:07] a sudden a pattern like hey what's done
[1:16:09] here at jericho going to be done in a.i
[1:16:11] be done at the next city
[1:16:13] it wasn't the same way
[1:16:15] but it was the same god
[1:16:18] same god things coming you and i
[1:16:21] different things that we see but it's
[1:16:24] the same god
[1:16:26] he said i am the same yesterday today
[1:16:29] and forever
[1:16:31] hallelujah
[1:16:32] if you endure chastening if you endure
[1:16:35] it
[1:16:36] god dealeth with you as with sons for
[1:16:38] what son is he whom the father
[1:16:41] chasteneth not
[1:16:44] but if you be without chastisement
[1:16:47] where of all are partakers
[1:16:50] then are you bastards and not sons
[1:16:53] so correction can come
[1:16:56] even tests and trials can come
[1:17:01] sometimes the tests and trials will come
[1:17:03] and you know what the test and trial
[1:17:05] remember
[1:17:06] it's only to prove or show what's really
[1:17:09] there
[1:17:12] sometimes in our lives and i'm saying in
[1:17:14] our lives we can feel like i'm so weak
[1:17:18] but you're standing
[1:17:21] you're standing
[1:17:22] and it's not you that's standing
[1:17:25] it's god who's standing in your life
[1:17:29] what should i do stand with him who's
[1:17:32] standing for you
[1:17:36] hallelujah we're in that time of trouble
[1:17:39] right now
[1:17:40] hallelujah
[1:17:42] think of it where we are in
[1:17:44] moments and times
[1:17:47] uh just like this where
[1:17:49] you know people oh you know
[1:17:51] ah i'm not going back there i don't want
[1:17:53] to hear this or i don't want to hear
[1:17:54] that or what and it just walks on away
[1:17:57] it gets it gets too tight
[1:18:00] it gets too close
[1:18:02] but what we're talking about is your
[1:18:03] soul
[1:18:06] god's desire our desire is not to feel
[1:18:09] comfortable here in this life or in a
[1:18:12] condition that would be unpleasing or
[1:18:15] unsatisfactory
[1:18:17] to almighty god
[1:18:19] we want to walk pleasing to him
[1:18:23] hallelujah
[1:18:25] to walk to to serve him but think about
[1:18:28] it they who are without it and yet
[1:18:30] they're not really without the
[1:18:31] chastisement as far as like hearing it
[1:18:36] but it's whether they receive it or not
[1:18:41] see we can hear the correction of the
[1:18:43] word but are we receiving the correction
[1:18:46] of the word when we hear the holy spirit
[1:18:48] cry out and say you can't keep living
[1:18:50] that kind of life do we hear it and say
[1:18:53] yeah lord that's true or do we say god
[1:18:56] come and change my life lord
[1:18:59] [Music]
[1:19:00] we don't want to be hearers of the word
[1:19:02] and deceive ourselves like that's true
[1:19:05] god knows exactly where i'm at he does
[1:19:09] and even with things that would be
[1:19:11] taking place within our life we don't
[1:19:14] want to just come and acknowledge it
[1:19:16] amen
[1:19:21] lord i want to hear what you have to say
[1:19:23] and he says
[1:19:24] what he has to say concerning it and
[1:19:26] then you come back to him again lord i
[1:19:28] want to hear what you have to say
[1:19:30] he says the same thing
[1:19:32] lord i want to hear what you have to say
[1:19:33] no really to be honest you say lord i
[1:19:36] don't like what you're saying so i'm
[1:19:37] going to keep pushing the butt until i
[1:19:38] get a different response
[1:19:41] i'm going to tell you what balaam did
[1:19:42] balaam kept pushing the button
[1:19:45] till eventually god gave him the desire
[1:19:49] of his heart
[1:19:51] what balaam needed to do instead of
[1:19:53] pushing the bat and looking for a
[1:19:55] different response he needed to ask god
[1:19:58] to change his desires
[1:20:01] right away when the word said this is
[1:20:04] not the way that should have been enough
[1:20:07] hey balaam was a prophet not a true one
[1:20:10] come on now inspiration came down upon
[1:20:14] balaam's life is that right
[1:20:16] but down on the inside
[1:20:18] was not a heart that was surrendered to
[1:20:21] god balaam could surrender his tongue to
[1:20:23] god he could prophesy under inspiration
[1:20:27] and it was not balaam's intelligence it
[1:20:30] was god who would speak through balaam
[1:20:33] even regarding a star shall arise out of
[1:20:36] jacob but do you realize even that
[1:20:39] moment of surrender where that came
[1:20:42] through is not enough to stand for
[1:20:45] balaam
[1:20:46] [Music]
[1:20:49] are you hearing me
[1:20:51] because his heart
[1:20:53] was not inclined with the things of god
[1:20:58] oh my god's not obligated to come where
[1:21:01] god you come and you bless me in the way
[1:21:03] that i'm going no
[1:21:05] god said
[1:21:06] my way
[1:21:08] and i know you might think different
[1:21:10] about my ways but my ways are higher
[1:21:13] than your ways
[1:21:16] is that right
[1:21:18] notice
[1:21:20] verse 9
[1:21:21] furthermore we had fathers of our flesh
[1:21:24] which corrected us
[1:21:26] and we gave them reverence
[1:21:32] is that right
[1:21:33] what was the reverence we heeded to what
[1:21:35] they were asking
[1:21:40] there's a lot that goes with this right
[1:21:41] here in verse nine just as i'm reading
[1:21:43] just things just continue to open
[1:21:45] within this because
[1:21:47] all of this here here to give reverence
[1:21:50] it's even that who deals with
[1:21:51] relationship we could go on to this but
[1:21:53] i just want to stay focused here this
[1:21:55] morning is that okay
[1:21:58] shall we not know and shall we not much
[1:22:00] rather be in subjection
[1:22:02] unto the father of spirits and live
[1:22:06] there's things let's be honest
[1:22:08] that our mother and father corrected us
[1:22:10] on
[1:22:11] at that time
[1:22:13] at that time
[1:22:14] we thought
[1:22:15] this is over the top
[1:22:18] maybe i need to get some of the young
[1:22:20] people to give me some phrases you know
[1:22:21] like hashtag over the top
[1:22:25] and i don't see what's wrong with that
[1:22:28] i think you've been too picky right here
[1:22:32] so-and-so does this so-and-so does that
[1:22:37] right
[1:22:39] but the difference was here's the thing
[1:22:42] now now now listen friends i'm not
[1:22:44] talking about harshness or severity i'm
[1:22:46] what i'm talking about is is the
[1:22:48] correction
[1:22:49] when it came not only has it strayed
[1:22:52] into straighten things out and i'm not
[1:22:54] just talking about with things down the
[1:22:56] line like oh thank god that you know my
[1:22:58] dad gave me a weapon i wasn't in that
[1:23:00] bank robbery i know there's been those
[1:23:01] that have they've got that kind of a
[1:23:03] testimony they weren't out with certain
[1:23:05] boys at night my daddy was one of them
[1:23:07] he told his daddy i'm going out with
[1:23:09] those boys and my papal said no you're
[1:23:12] not
[1:23:13] 17 years old don't make a difference
[1:23:16] you're not going
[1:23:18] oh god give us more fathers like that
[1:23:21] i'm not talking about maybe exactly the
[1:23:23] way that my papal did it but let me say
[1:23:25] this to you right now they're under our
[1:23:27] roof the token is applied and we as for
[1:23:30] me in my house we're gonna serve the
[1:23:32] lord
[1:23:34] are you hearing are you hearing me
[1:23:36] we're not going to apply the token to
[1:23:38] the kitchen and you know to master
[1:23:40] bedroom and and on you know to the
[1:23:42] living room but you know we're not going
[1:23:44] to apply the token you know to your
[1:23:46] bedroom the token was to be upon the
[1:23:49] house
[1:23:53] true preached brother samuel
[1:23:57] and he's already taken this all along so
[1:23:59] we're just going to run with it
[1:24:02] there's things that he speaks to us now
[1:24:04] let's bring it down to a spiritual
[1:24:06] there's things that he speaks to you and
[1:24:08] i
[1:24:09] that sometimes there's things where god
[1:24:10] brings correction to our life we don't
[1:24:13] understand it
[1:24:15] we don't understand maybe why there be
[1:24:18] certain dissolving of certain
[1:24:19] relationships or why this has taken
[1:24:21] place or why that is taking place you
[1:24:23] understand i'm talking about relations
[1:24:24] with the things of the world and you'll
[1:24:26] find that there's things sometimes that
[1:24:28] we just can't understand let me tell you
[1:24:30] something i bet you abraham couldn't
[1:24:32] understand why is it this contention
[1:24:35] going on why can't we all just get along
[1:24:37] and why can't we all just hold hands
[1:24:39] around the fire and get along but god
[1:24:42] was there and he was going to bring a
[1:24:44] separation he was forcing abraham's hand
[1:24:48] to it because abraham was still packing
[1:24:51] around lot
[1:24:54] why human
[1:24:56] compassion
[1:24:58] that has got many in trouble human
[1:25:02] compassion
[1:25:03] that don't know how to separate human
[1:25:05] compassion from the love of god
[1:25:08] the love of god will have you do things
[1:25:11] even when it comes in discipline that
[1:25:13] your human compassion could say this is
[1:25:16] not how i want to do it
[1:25:18] are you hearing me now
[1:25:20] but the love of god will work in that
[1:25:22] strain because it is on a higher order
[1:25:29] it's like your children you can explain
[1:25:31] to them that the stove is hot but you
[1:25:32] don't sit down and have a
[1:25:35] science lesson with them now sit down
[1:25:37] i'm going to i'm going to sit down and
[1:25:38] explain this to us because most of us in
[1:25:40] here probably don't even know that now
[1:25:43] it's enough that you know now hot
[1:25:45] i ain't going near it
[1:25:49] and if you went near it and it's hot
[1:25:51] and you got too close you're going to be
[1:25:53] hot whether it's by the fire
[1:25:56] or the belt or the
[1:25:58] paddle or the
[1:26:02] are you with me this morning
[1:26:05] god
[1:26:06] brings correction
[1:26:10] and he wants he listen this isn't our
[1:26:12] things that comes around that god just
[1:26:14] wants us to look at and say man i don't
[1:26:16] know why in the world i don't know what
[1:26:18] i don't know this i god
[1:26:20] god desires because there's some times
[1:26:22] where we just don't understand you know
[1:26:23] brother brahm tells us like this with
[1:26:25] the chastening of the lord he says
[1:26:26] sometimes he said god will permit you to
[1:26:28] be put in a wheelchair
[1:26:31] god will be permit a sickness
[1:26:34] god will permit things just to see
[1:26:37] what kind of attitude you're going to
[1:26:38] take in it
[1:26:40] see god the molding of our character
[1:26:44] it works even to where our attitude
[1:26:46] about certain things
[1:26:49] is that right
[1:26:50] i mean sometimes when we go through
[1:26:52] things we'd like to say
[1:26:54] you know other well i guess others
[1:26:56] today's super bowl party we said i'm
[1:26:58] having a pity party
[1:27:01] just bring over the bones from the wings
[1:27:03] you know we're having a pity party
[1:27:05] come on friends i'm not saying that to
[1:27:07] put anybody down but you you know what
[1:27:08] i'm talking about
[1:27:18] shall we not be in subjection unto the
[1:27:19] father spirits and live just just submit
[1:27:22] and say lord
[1:27:23] that's what you're that's what you're
[1:27:25] saying that's what you're doing right
[1:27:26] now this is lord whatever's being done
[1:27:30] help me to receive
[1:27:32] what's going on right now
[1:27:34] if it's through a test if it's a trial
[1:27:37] correction that's coming to my life with
[1:27:39] things help me to receive
[1:27:42] what's taking place right now what
[1:27:43] you're going to what you're doing right
[1:27:44] now what's coming about
[1:27:46] to mold me
[1:27:47] for that next step
[1:27:50] for they verily for a few days chastened
[1:27:52] us
[1:27:52] after their own pleasure meaning desires
[1:27:55] and things that they've seen in our
[1:27:57] lives right
[1:28:00] you know it's just like when you see
[1:28:03] brother braham tells us he said you see
[1:28:04] a boy
[1:28:06] and he gets his own way right now
[1:28:09] he said i'd advise that young man to
[1:28:11] never get married
[1:28:13] until he meets god
[1:28:15] because he said the woman that he's
[1:28:17] married mary he'll make hell on earth
[1:28:18] for her
[1:28:23] come on now these are things what's he
[1:28:24] talking about character
[1:28:28] is to be able to look at these things i
[1:28:30] know sometimes these can be kind of
[1:28:31] touchy and and this and that but that's
[1:28:33] okay we won't be touchy
[1:28:37] sometimes we're looking at different
[1:28:38] things and it's important that within
[1:28:41] this that they did it for our own
[1:28:43] pleasure not about you got on my nerves
[1:28:45] that's not how god does it
[1:28:47] god brings discipline to our lives now
[1:28:50] hear me now on this
[1:28:52] god brings discipline because there is a
[1:28:55] purpose that he has called us to and is
[1:28:58] calling us to
[1:28:59] there's a job to be done
[1:29:02] and just like you brother said you know
[1:29:04] well
[1:29:06] plumbing school and some are you in and
[1:29:07] right now
[1:29:08] i mean they don't just let things slide
[1:29:10] right by and say oh you know what drake
[1:29:12] brian you guys man you guys you know if
[1:29:14] there's things they can see right now
[1:29:16] even things they've been through other
[1:29:19] plumbers will say hey let me just give
[1:29:21] you benefit from my mistakes when you
[1:29:24] see this go this way
[1:29:27] don't try this right here no you feel
[1:29:29] like you can do it but don't get
[1:29:30] yourself tangled up with this why there
[1:29:33] are things that they are speaking to us
[1:29:35] in that hour that's not a correction
[1:29:37] like a belt coming that's there trying
[1:29:39] to help us in the midst of that
[1:29:41] situation and that's even as the word
[1:29:44] comes across our pathway every service
[1:29:47] is not a correction like this
[1:29:51] are you hearing me
[1:29:52] oh my brother samuel's got the spiritual
[1:29:55] belt out no every service is not like
[1:29:58] that there might be correction that has
[1:30:00] to come in that channel that's true but
[1:30:03] there's other things in our life that he
[1:30:05] has to speak to us and we can say oh i
[1:30:08] need to correct this
[1:30:11] sometimes there's things that we have
[1:30:13] in our disposal like god has been
[1:30:15] preaching to us on prayer or speaking to
[1:30:18] us teaching to us
[1:30:20] it's already in our disposal
[1:30:22] but he's letting us know
[1:30:25] the great power within this tool this
[1:30:27] weapon
[1:30:32] they've done it for their own pleasure
[1:30:33] in other words things that they could
[1:30:34] see
[1:30:35] as a father could say i can't let the
[1:30:37] sun do like this because i tell you what
[1:30:40] if my son if he starts well he knows
[1:30:42] more than the teachers
[1:30:44] or my daughter knows more than the
[1:30:46] teachers and you back that up
[1:30:49] guess what eventually it'll go keep on
[1:30:52] going up the ladder
[1:30:54] and remember who's above all
[1:30:56] god
[1:30:58] we are living in a society right now
[1:31:02] come on now
[1:31:03] brother branham told us he said we talk
[1:31:05] about juvenile delinquency he said it's
[1:31:07] actually parental delinquency then he
[1:31:09] brought it on down he said it's actually
[1:31:11] pulpit delinquency you see correction is
[1:31:14] to begin at the house of god you know
[1:31:17] what it says that all of our lives our
[1:31:19] homes should be ordered by the word of
[1:31:22] the lord
[1:31:24] that's what it's to be under we need his
[1:31:26] guidance and his direction for our lives
[1:31:32] this is why god had back in the old
[1:31:34] testament
[1:31:35] they had the shackle of the sanctuary
[1:31:38] and that shekel
[1:31:40] was what determined the weight of
[1:31:42] everything else
[1:31:44] the shackle was not determined outside
[1:31:47] of the sanctuary the shackle is what was
[1:31:50] determined it was sat inside the
[1:31:51] sanctuary i say that shekel presented to
[1:31:54] you and i in this hour it was a shackle
[1:31:57] that had been shaved down and cut out it
[1:31:59] didn't hold the same power and the same
[1:32:02] way but god has raised up a true shackle
[1:32:06] of himself of his own person that it
[1:32:09] comes down to every life that you and i
[1:32:11] can walk with the token the baptism of
[1:32:14] the holy ghost the shackle of the
[1:32:16] sanctuary
[1:32:18] that when things are presented we can
[1:32:20] weigh it and say nope this
[1:32:23] seems pretty good but
[1:32:25] no no
[1:32:27] ain't working out
[1:32:29] this is a balance in case some of you
[1:32:31] didn't know i know oh that's nothing all
[1:32:33] i have is a smartphone but you
[1:32:34] understand
[1:32:35] the balance they put that shackle there
[1:32:38] and the shackle had a weight did it
[1:32:40] match the weight of rice or whatever it
[1:32:42] is they were weighing
[1:32:45] it was valued by the weight it's not by
[1:32:47] how it looked
[1:32:50] i could take two different balls up here
[1:32:53] and i could take them balls and i could
[1:32:54] have one here that's no more than one of
[1:32:56] them kmart or target balls or whatever
[1:32:58] you know the kinds in the racks that are
[1:33:01] we used to sneak around them
[1:33:04] if it was painted up like a bowling ball
[1:33:06] and then i had a real bowling ball here
[1:33:10] and then i looked at brother david i
[1:33:12] said
[1:33:12] you ready
[1:33:17] and then here it was
[1:33:19] i threw the ball
[1:33:21] that wasn't really a bowling ball but it
[1:33:23] looked like it
[1:33:24] he would brace differently
[1:33:27] and then when he
[1:33:28] this ain't the bowling ball but it
[1:33:30] looked like it
[1:33:32] you see god is not interested
[1:33:35] in just how things
[1:33:37] that it looks like it
[1:33:40] his image is what comes from the inside
[1:33:43] out in our life
[1:33:45] he works to bring forth that image
[1:33:47] that's why when when when when when
[1:33:49] they're taking the gold and the beater
[1:33:51] would beat the gold beat the goal beat
[1:33:52] the goal beat the goal beat the goal and
[1:33:53] he's doing it until he can finally see
[1:33:55] his reflection in it and then he knows
[1:33:57] it's pure
[1:33:59] that's why god comes and he works and he
[1:34:02] works and he works and he works and he
[1:34:03] works in our life until eventually it
[1:34:06] has the reflection
[1:34:08] of jesus christ
[1:34:12] let me just try to
[1:34:14] bring this down because it's just normal
[1:34:19] let me just try i want to wrap just this
[1:34:21] this portion up right here
[1:34:30] brother branham you hear brother branham
[1:34:33] on tape and i want you just to
[1:34:35] can i have just a few moments here i
[1:34:37] want to just deal with this part as
[1:34:38] we've been looking with the chastening
[1:34:40] part
[1:34:41] brother brandon will make a statement
[1:34:45] brother brown will say
[1:34:46] god
[1:34:48] chastened job and it's absolutely
[1:34:50] correct
[1:34:53] then brother brown will come back around
[1:34:54] and he'll say this is out of the evening
[1:34:56] messenger
[1:34:58] do you remember when job had all his
[1:35:00] trials he said
[1:35:01] that wasn't god chastening job but it
[1:35:03] was god approving his servant you said
[1:35:05] the same that's a contradiction no it's
[1:35:07] not
[1:35:08] chastening and here's what i want you to
[1:35:10] really focus in
[1:35:11] chastening has many folds to it
[1:35:18] as far as correcting if we're looking at
[1:35:20] correction under chastening god was not
[1:35:23] correcting job
[1:35:25] but he was chastening him god
[1:35:29] had allowed permitted
[1:35:32] permitted
[1:35:34] satan
[1:35:35] to come at him
[1:35:38] is that right he permitted it
[1:35:41] but it was not god correcting him
[1:35:44] it was god approving him or allowing to
[1:35:49] come out of his life what was job's
[1:35:51] testimony
[1:35:52] i know when all this is said and done my
[1:35:56] life shall come forth as pure as gold
[1:36:01] job do you understand everything that's
[1:36:03] going on no i don't
[1:36:04] but i know
[1:36:06] he's not the author of confusion
[1:36:11] joe what do you know i'm going to stand
[1:36:13] on what i know and that is my sacrifice
[1:36:16] is what he gave me and i presented that
[1:36:19] sacrifice according to his word and i'm
[1:36:21] standing on it by the authority of the
[1:36:24] revelation that's been given to me and
[1:36:26] that's where i'm going to stand
[1:36:29] do you understand everything else that's
[1:36:31] going on i don't understand it
[1:36:35] but i know him
[1:36:36] in whom i have believed
[1:36:40] god is silent brother bram said
[1:36:42] sometimes god
[1:36:44] is silent
[1:36:46] to see what kind of attitude we'll take
[1:36:50] we've all been there right maybe there's
[1:36:52] this morning certain things we're
[1:36:53] praying about and it seems like i don't
[1:36:54] see no answer i don't see no answer let
[1:36:57] me tell you something don't go looking
[1:36:59] for other answers in other places
[1:37:02] are you hearing me now let me tell you
[1:37:04] something i've had situations where you
[1:37:06] know even in the testimony and when i
[1:37:08] went into teaching that god spoke
[1:37:10] through somebody else that i don't even
[1:37:11] know as a believer but i didn't go to
[1:37:13] that man
[1:37:15] are you hearing me i didn't go to him
[1:37:16] and say hey what do you think ought to
[1:37:18] be i was looking to the lord and when
[1:37:21] you're looking to the lord and you stay
[1:37:23] in contact with god god can speak to you
[1:37:26] through different avenues
[1:37:30] but you'll recognize it as god
[1:37:34] are you hearing me
[1:37:36] you know you know exactly what i'm
[1:37:38] talking about you recognize hey this is
[1:37:39] god that's speaking
[1:37:43] how does that happen brother samuel do
[1:37:45] you have to be in contact with the voice
[1:37:48] of god
[1:37:50] and the voice of god is not a man
[1:37:53] the voice of god is the holy ghost
[1:37:57] he said he will lead and guide us when
[1:37:59] israel was coming into the promised land
[1:38:01] everybody who gave them bread and water
[1:38:04] or would help them along the way was not
[1:38:06] believers but they received it
[1:38:11] amen
[1:38:12] is that right
[1:38:16] jesus walking
[1:38:18] close
[1:38:19] to the lord walking in close fellowship
[1:38:22] with him this was not chastening or
[1:38:24] correcting
[1:38:26] but chastening of the lord has many
[1:38:28] folds there's tests
[1:38:30] there's trials
[1:38:32] there's persecution
[1:38:35] and there's correction
[1:38:38] right
[1:38:39] all four things
[1:38:41] and tests and trials things that come
[1:38:43] now look sickness can come
[1:38:46] as a test or trial
[1:38:49] right
[1:38:51] see what we're going to do about it
[1:38:53] but then also sickness can be
[1:38:57] come as a correction to our life
[1:39:01] is that right see this is where
[1:39:04] the three buddies of job
[1:39:08] they didn't understand the chastening of
[1:39:10] the lord
[1:39:11] the only thing they saw about chastening
[1:39:13] is you messed up
[1:39:16] who you really messed up man
[1:39:19] bad news bad news george
[1:39:24] they didn't understand that other part
[1:39:28] they didn't understand that there is a
[1:39:30] molding of character that through tests
[1:39:33] and trials and even in correction when
[1:39:36] we can receive what's taking place there
[1:39:39] is a greater reality that will move in
[1:39:43] our lives and we can see the love of god
[1:39:46] the reality of god and who we are even
[1:39:48] more clearly
[1:39:55] you see we've been called by god by the
[1:39:58] living god
[1:40:03] our purpose is not something just
[1:40:05] contrived in time no no
[1:40:07] no
[1:40:08] paul wrote to titus our purpose the
[1:40:10] calling
[1:40:11] was given before the foundation of the
[1:40:13] world
[1:40:15] and this is why that purpose
[1:40:18] that purpose is greater
[1:40:20] than any earthly purpose
[1:40:23] and i want you to hear me
[1:40:25] this purpose that god has called us for
[1:40:28] everything else comes out of there to
[1:40:31] see that this purpose is achieved not
[1:40:34] that other things come before it
[1:40:39] whether it's your job your occupation
[1:40:40] your family and god god did not give you
[1:40:43] your family for your family to become a
[1:40:45] hindrance
[1:40:47] god gave you your children to be a
[1:40:49] blessing
[1:40:50] and that you would raise them in the
[1:40:52] admonition of the lord be an example to
[1:40:54] guide and direct them correct them when
[1:40:56] they need to be corrected
[1:41:03] this is why friends
[1:41:05] when things are out of line in our lives
[1:41:08] and priorities become address adjusted
[1:41:10] we're talking about priorities now
[1:41:14] and the real focus and purpose becomes
[1:41:16] all together different
[1:41:19] than the chastening of the lord
[1:41:21] correction
[1:41:22] comes to our life
[1:41:24] what we read in our text
[1:41:27] where god told them to consider their
[1:41:28] ways
[1:41:30] this was the mercy and the love of
[1:41:33] almighty god
[1:41:36] these people were not lazy
[1:41:40] are you hearing me
[1:41:41] they didn't shut down and say
[1:41:43] we're going to wait for checks
[1:41:46] i'm gonna preach now
[1:41:48] because that's a spirit even that's out
[1:41:50] here in this age
[1:41:51] where nobody wants to work
[1:41:54] and not that any when you go to work and
[1:41:56] say hey man
[1:41:57] but we're thankful to have a job think
[1:42:00] we'll have bread on the table is that
[1:42:01] right
[1:42:02] we're thankful because we know god's
[1:42:04] provided that but that's not my focus
[1:42:09] they weren't they didn't shut down
[1:42:12] what happened is their strength and
[1:42:14] their zeal turned completely to the
[1:42:18] natural things of life
[1:42:20] that's the way it was in the garden of
[1:42:22] eden when the fall came they went to
[1:42:25] make something for
[1:42:26] themselves to try to stand in god's
[1:42:29] presence stand in the face of what was
[1:42:32] coming at them let me say this the
[1:42:34] natural things of life we can all
[1:42:36] testify to this it will only leave us
[1:42:40] empty it'll never meet the challenge of
[1:42:44] the hour
[1:42:46] you can't face the things and say man
[1:42:49] the heat's coming on it's not the time
[1:42:51] to get away from god it's not the time
[1:42:54] to let down on the things of god
[1:42:57] brother samuel satan seems like he's
[1:42:59] waylay in my family now's not the time
[1:43:02] to compromise now's the time more than
[1:43:06] ever to stand
[1:43:09] stand therefore and have your
[1:43:12] loins curd about with truth
[1:43:14] who's not compromising on it now is not
[1:43:17] that time
[1:43:19] amen
[1:43:21] priorities become adjusted because
[1:43:23] listen not one of us
[1:43:26] enjoy hardship
[1:43:30] you can lay me whether it's financial
[1:43:32] whether anything
[1:43:35] being misunderstood
[1:43:36] disagreements whatever none of us like
[1:43:39] that
[1:43:45] i'm gonna preach while it's coming
[1:43:47] well brother samuel that ain't bothering
[1:43:49] me
[1:43:50] you're not telling the truth
[1:43:52] because when it's down there inside of
[1:43:54] your crawl down inside of here you can
[1:43:56] say well that ain't bothering me but it
[1:43:58] comes out towards other people
[1:44:01] comes out towards other people
[1:44:04] come on friends
[1:44:05] that's why it has to be a work the holy
[1:44:08] spirit we gotta listen i'm not
[1:44:10] interested because god knows my weakness
[1:44:12] he knows your weakness
[1:44:14] the bible says all things are naked
[1:44:16] before him with whom we have to do
[1:44:19] so it's just like when god comes down
[1:44:21] and deals with our life he's not coming
[1:44:23] down to shame us but if we can stand up
[1:44:25] and stand up and say that's true lord
[1:44:28] and god will say that's my boy that's my
[1:44:31] girl standing right with the word of god
[1:44:33] and gotta go right to work in that in
[1:44:35] our life he didn't come down to condemn
[1:44:37] us but will we line up with that word
[1:44:40] and then it affects everything else
[1:44:43] around us
[1:44:44] sometimes we're carrying too much in
[1:44:46] here
[1:44:47] too much in here we start carrying
[1:44:48] around
[1:44:52] and then what happens starts trying to
[1:44:54] fulfill it with other things
[1:44:59] this wasn't what was coming on here what
[1:45:01] we just read in our text was not
[1:45:03] persecution
[1:45:06] oh
[1:45:07] we're being persecuted they were
[1:45:10] they were
[1:45:11] 15 years ago they were persecuted and
[1:45:13] that's why
[1:45:14] the enemy kept on coming at him
[1:45:17] pounding at him
[1:45:18] day by day
[1:45:21] you think when the enemy came to him
[1:45:24] you think that they just oh
[1:45:27] the enemy didn't show up today
[1:45:31] but some things that the enemy the
[1:45:32] adversary showed up when they hired
[1:45:35] counselors did you hear what the bible
[1:45:36] says hired counselors what's a counselor
[1:45:39] it's a wordy guy
[1:45:44] and satan's very wordy
[1:45:50] i'm not talking about somebody can just
[1:45:52] take up your time i'm talking about he's
[1:45:53] worthy he likes to use a word
[1:45:56] but he likes to spin it in his way
[1:46:00] well we're getting on him now boy
[1:46:02] somebody might as well say amen sick and
[1:46:04] bull we got him treed
[1:46:09] he likes to do that
[1:46:11] why because if he can get you into
[1:46:14] paying attention to that and heeding to
[1:46:16] that you find yourself just shut down
[1:46:21] that's a trap of the enemy
[1:46:24] he's not interested in saying well you
[1:46:25] know what well you got to go back to the
[1:46:27] world for me to be satisfied but if you
[1:46:29] just shut down he's like i got him
[1:46:32] they're not living victorious that's all
[1:46:33] i wanted
[1:46:35] but you were made to live victorious let
[1:46:38] me just say made for it you're built for
[1:46:40] the victory of god to be displayed in
[1:46:42] your life
[1:46:44] say brother samuel you don't know what
[1:46:45] test or what trials or what adversity
[1:46:47] i'm facing but let me tell you something
[1:46:50] nothing is greater than the one who
[1:46:52] descended down to the lowest parts of
[1:46:54] hell and took away the sin question out
[1:46:57] of your life and raised up on that
[1:46:59] easter morning and ascended above every
[1:47:02] triumph over every principalities and
[1:47:05] ascended on high brother not only did he
[1:47:07] defeat the unseen realm he conquered
[1:47:10] even the laws that said a man can't
[1:47:13] ascend
[1:47:15] he showed i'm god
[1:47:17] over my own laws
[1:47:20] [Applause]
[1:47:23] that's the kind of stuff you're made out
[1:47:25] of
[1:47:25] that's the kind of stuff that this god
[1:47:28] is
[1:47:33] they weren't being persecuted
[1:47:35] they were being chastened
[1:47:48] let me just close with this
[1:47:52] and we'll pick up
[1:47:54] lord willing
[1:47:57] i'd say this lord
[1:48:00] we must discern by the word of god
[1:48:03] this is why when we come to the house of
[1:48:05] god we we need to come to the house of
[1:48:06] god
[1:48:09] let me say this
[1:48:11] you need to be in the message of the
[1:48:12] hour
[1:48:16] well brother samuel i went and got a
[1:48:18] devotional from a bookstore you need to
[1:48:20] be in the message of the hour
[1:48:24] if you're more of a devotional than
[1:48:25] being in the message of the hour and
[1:48:27] getting into that you need to lay that
[1:48:28] aside you need to get into the message
[1:48:30] of the hour
[1:48:33] brother samuel i i don't understand it
[1:48:36] you cast down that evil one who's
[1:48:38] telling you that
[1:48:39] you know that it was god who sent this
[1:48:41] message
[1:48:43] this message is the revelation of jesus
[1:48:45] christ it's this message right here
[1:48:48] being ministered that's his presence
[1:48:50] that you sense
[1:48:53] i'm not knocking anything with devotions

[1:48:57] here all these other books and i'm
[1:48:59] studying this and studying that get into
[1:49:02] the message of the hour
[1:49:08] zealous for these things friends

[1:49:59] and there was a chief reaper
[1:50:02] who was over the rest that caught his
[1:50:04] descent
[1:50:06] the lord himself shall descend from
[1:50:09] heaven with a shout a voice and a trump
[1:50:11] of an archangel
[1:50:12] the chief reaper
[1:50:15] being the messenger of this hour caught
[1:50:17] that

[1:50:26] stay in this field
[1:50:28] glean
[1:50:30] from the word of the lord
[1:50:34] but some you saying other people don't
[1:50:35] have truth
[1:50:37] this word in this hour is an assembling
[1:50:42] of truth
[1:50:43] that have been scattered
[1:50:46] i don't have to assemble it
[1:50:49] it's already been assembled
[1:50:52] [Applause]
[1:50:56] i know where the asparagus is at
[1:50:58] i know where the cabbage is at
[1:51:00] i know where the spices is at it's all
[1:51:04] been stored up for right now
[1:51:08] oh there's a famine in the land there is
[1:51:10] for the hearing of the word of god but
[1:51:13] there's no famine among the bride of
[1:51:16] jesus christ
[1:51:19] amen there is strength there is food
[1:51:21] that's able to give you strength to fly
[1:51:24] above the things of the world the things
[1:51:26] that you battle with there is strength
[1:51:28] in this word
[1:51:36] i tell you friends what kind of people
[1:51:37] we would be
[1:51:38] if we really avail ourselves morning
[1:51:40] satan battles that
[1:51:43] but take back
[1:51:44] like god told us on thursday redeemed
[1:51:46] the time
[1:51:49] bring it back to yourself
[1:51:51] it's your time
[1:51:57] there's a brother here right now
[1:51:59] he had a property over there in
[1:52:01] south lorraine
[1:52:02] and there was a
[1:52:04] guy who wanted to build a garage
[1:52:07] you know there's
[1:52:08] got to stay within
[1:52:10] i don't know what it is now
[1:52:13] from a property line i don't know what
[1:52:14] it is brother joy but some you got to
[1:52:16] stay within a certain you know amount
[1:52:21] well this individual
[1:52:23] you know he wanted to put a garage right
[1:52:25] up on the property line or actually over
[1:52:26] the property line
[1:52:28] and the brother's like hey no no no no
[1:52:30] no no you can't do that you gotta abide
[1:52:31] by the law it says however many feet
[1:52:33] from that
[1:52:34] but you see what happens is if he
[1:52:36] wouldn't have stayed with that
[1:52:39] and checked on it
[1:52:41] eventually
[1:52:42] that man might have said you know what
[1:52:43] he's given up let's just build the
[1:52:45] garage on here
[1:52:48] and we can be honest there's things
[1:52:50] that can be built
[1:52:54] in our life and that's why the spirit of
[1:52:56] god would say give no place to the devil
[1:52:59] and sometimes when the spirit of god
[1:53:01] reveals things we say
[1:53:03] time for dynamite time for strongholds
[1:53:05] to come down
[1:53:07] time for strongholds to come down
[1:53:09] there's dynamite the dynamics of god
[1:53:14] to bring down strongholds
[1:53:22] this is why we need the discernment by
[1:53:25] the word of god
[1:53:26] and listen
[1:53:27] it's not just coming to church
[1:53:31] but it's recognizing that when we come
[1:53:32] to church and the word is being
[1:53:34] ministered and god deals with our heart
[1:53:38] to act upon that word
[1:53:42] act upon that word
[1:53:44] and as
[1:53:45] then
[1:53:47] you go out these doors
[1:53:49] you're walking in fellowship with him
[1:53:51] when you put on a tape
[1:53:53] you're going to read the scripture
[1:53:55] you're meditating on him hey this is
[1:53:57] between you and him
[1:54:00] this is between you and him this isn't
[1:54:01] between you him and brother samuel no no
[1:54:07] i don't cook it
[1:54:08] i just serve it
[1:54:12] right
[1:54:13] even though a lot of times the waiter of
[1:54:15] the waitress boy they're the ones that
[1:54:16] gets it
[1:54:17] because the cook
[1:54:19] why you sending this take out here like
[1:54:24] hey can you step out here a minute
[1:54:29] but he knows what we need
[1:54:33] and i say it like this
[1:54:35] i am closing
[1:54:36] i am
[1:54:38] this is why we need to
[1:54:40] be discerned by the word of god
[1:54:43] or we can become like these individuals
[1:54:45] that had gotten so far out of the will
[1:54:47] of god
[1:54:49] but here's what they thought
[1:54:51] they thought we just need to be more
[1:54:52] fervent
[1:54:54] man
[1:54:56] we're i mean i'm working more
[1:54:59] but the money ain't going this far
[1:55:01] i just got to put more into you know
[1:55:02] what we got to do more we got to do more
[1:55:05] we got to do more
[1:55:07] that was in them
[1:55:09] but because
[1:55:13] that they had succumbed to the pressure
[1:55:15] of the enemy
[1:55:17] by getting away from the strength their
[1:55:19] source of strength
[1:55:22] it had so changed their thought process
[1:55:24] to this ain't the time to build it
[1:55:27] instead
[1:55:29] we need to focus
[1:55:31] on our homes
[1:55:33] we need to focus on our lives
[1:55:35] see how it was a trap it was a trap
[1:55:38] how the enemy had so slightly diverted
[1:55:40] it
[1:55:42] if not for the grace of god
[1:55:44] these people would have continued in the
[1:55:47] same pattern
[1:55:49] but god's grace
[1:55:53] the word of the lord came to haggai
[1:55:56] and discerned
[1:55:58] what was going on but had them to
[1:56:00] reflect
[1:56:01] into their own lives
[1:56:04] you see
[1:56:06] if we were to ask them
[1:56:08] they said man
[1:56:09] i'll tell you what it's just true it's
[1:56:11] just
[1:56:12] well the enemy's just really no the
[1:56:14] enemy wasn't doing that
[1:56:17] you see sometimes the devil gets blamed
[1:56:19] for things
[1:56:20] that he ain't even doing
[1:56:25] well
[1:56:26] now god permits
[1:56:29] but satan what god was coming around
[1:56:32] here is there had to be correction
[1:56:36] because they had become occupied
[1:56:39] with things
[1:56:43] gifts
[1:56:44] instead of the giver
[1:56:46] things of life
[1:56:50] instead of him
[1:56:52] i want you to think of this as we close
[1:56:55] in matthew chapter 6
[1:56:58] where the bible says in matthew chapter
[1:56:59] 6
[1:57:01] it says
[1:57:03] take no thought
[1:57:05] you know the scripture what will i eat
[1:57:07] what will i drink sometimes those are
[1:57:09] things you
[1:57:12] you've got to consider
[1:57:14] right
[1:57:17] it's true
[1:57:20] you know i remember when my wife and i
[1:57:22] were first married i remember going
[1:57:23] through the checkout line and you get up
[1:57:25] there and
[1:57:26] gotta put this back put this back put
[1:57:27] that back and put this back i remember
[1:57:29] that
[1:57:30] there are those times
[1:57:35] but sometimes when we're looking at
[1:57:39] this right here
[1:57:40] jesus knowing i want you to think of
[1:57:43] this friends he's letting us know
[1:57:45] the gentiles seek after all this
[1:57:50] and notice he says gentiles
[1:57:53] oh israel doesn't seek after all that
[1:57:56] but remember israel had all they had the
[1:57:58] covenants the promise of adoption all
[1:58:00] those other things
[1:58:02] right
[1:58:05] but let me say this
[1:58:07] abraham was a gentile
[1:58:13] well samuel it says abraham the hebrew
[1:58:16] brother bram said he was a gentile
[1:58:18] he came out of a gentile nation chaldeas
[1:58:20] right
[1:58:21] well how could it be called hebrew
[1:58:23] because hebrew means one from beyond
[1:58:28] he received a call from another world
[1:58:31] from the living god and that's why he
[1:58:34] became a hebrew a real hebrew it's not a
[1:58:37] hebrew in flesh it's a hebrew in spirit
[1:58:43] and with being a hebrew and spirit we
[1:58:45] have promises
[1:58:48] we have great exceeding precious
[1:58:51] promises
[1:58:53] that our lives to be occupied with those
[1:58:55] promises and not with the things
[1:58:58] things of this worth because as jesus
[1:59:01] said seek ye first the kingdom of god
[1:59:03] and all of his righteousness let that be
[1:59:05] first
[1:59:07] and then all these other
[1:59:09] say it again
[1:59:10] things
[1:59:14] all these great things all this oh
[1:59:16] brother samuel this is so
[1:59:18] thin
[1:59:22] oh
[1:59:23] brother samuel this
[1:59:25] thing
[1:59:27] the kingdom of god is that which
[1:59:31] deserves the priority and the
[1:59:32] recognition in our life everything else
[1:59:35] falls under the category of things
[1:59:41] what is that
[1:59:42] thing thing
[1:59:45] almost like the dr seuss book thing one
[1:59:47] and thing two
[1:59:50] things
[1:59:53] i say god help us imagine
[1:59:55] let's just stop
[1:59:58] it takes me sometimes a longer time to
[1:59:59] come down here
[2:00:04] but let's allow the spirit of god listen
[2:00:05] friends let's let's just not move from
[2:00:07] this service here this morning
[2:00:10] and just let it be but let's just just
[2:00:13] be a service that oh my the presence of
[2:00:15] god but let it be examined in our life
[2:00:18] examination even right now examine as
[2:00:21] even we leave from this place
[2:00:23] and to ask and say
[2:00:25] are my priorities what they were
[2:00:28] a month ago
[2:00:30] are my priorities what they were a year
[2:00:32] ago
[2:00:36] you see god keeps bringing us back to
[2:00:37] this we're looking at a mirror
[2:00:39] not a picture
[2:00:43] god's dealing with us right now not on
[2:00:45] what we were a month ago
[2:00:47] he's speaking to us for what we are
[2:00:49] right now
[2:00:50] he's dealing with present
[2:00:53] situations
[2:00:55] you see he is i'm he that
[2:00:58] which is
[2:00:59] which was and which is to come
[2:01:02] he's the god who's able to point back
[2:01:04] and say this is what you were but
[2:01:07] somewhere between here and where you are
[2:01:09] now
[2:01:10] oh it's got in the way
[2:01:12] and he deals can deal with that
[2:01:14] in each of our lives
[2:01:16] we want him to deal with in our lives
[2:01:18] friends you can see right here with
[2:01:20] these believers that we read about here
[2:01:22] and reading and god's been having us
[2:01:24] look at this
[2:01:25] if not for the mercies of god
[2:01:27] these people would have worked
[2:01:29] themselves to death
[2:01:31] are you hearing me
[2:01:33] they weren't they weren't lazy they
[2:01:34] weren't slaughterful they were workers
[2:01:40] but satan
[2:01:42] through false accusations through
[2:01:45] weariness of persecution had caused them
[2:01:48] to divert their strength
[2:01:51] to the natural things of life
[2:01:55] and the natural things of life
[2:01:57] can never
[2:01:58] satisfy
[2:02:00] the spiritual man
[2:02:02] on the inside
[2:02:05] there's only one that can do that
[2:02:07] and that's
[2:02:08] our heavenly father
[2:02:14] he's mindful
[2:02:15] of our needs
[2:02:17] i say the greatest thing we could do is
[2:02:18] say god
[2:02:20] just examining my life and even as
[2:02:22] you should terry and i walk out of this
[2:02:24] building this morning
[2:02:26] i want to look in the word and look if
[2:02:28] the word cuts say amen to the word god
[2:02:34] i've not i've not started this in vain
[2:02:36] because i didn't start this work in my
[2:02:38] life
[2:02:40] he who began the good work in me shall
[2:02:42] perform it to the day of jesus christ
[2:02:44] and i'm going to let him do it
[2:02:46] i'm going to say amen to the word i'm
[2:02:48] going to stand on the word even when it
[2:02:49] cuts and it stings and i don't
[2:02:51] understand it but i'm going to stand
[2:02:53] on the word of god
[2:02:56] because when we stand there that day
[2:02:58] the toils
[2:03:00] of this life
[2:03:02] road will seem nothing
[2:03:05] when i get to
[2:03:07] the end of the way brother bill can sing
[2:03:09] it he can really sing it
[2:03:11] we should have him sing it right now
[2:03:14] the toils of this life
[2:03:16] will seem nothing
[2:03:18] when i get
[2:03:20] to the end of the way
[2:03:24] i say god let us just take it in right
[2:03:26] now
[2:03:27] let's just say lord thank you for your
[2:03:29] chastening thank you for correction
[2:03:31] thank you for the tests and trials thank
[2:03:32] you for
[2:03:33] like you did for these believers lord
[2:03:35] they didn't know what was going on
[2:03:36] around their life they they were
[2:03:38] probably calling it persecution i'll
[2:03:39] tell you there's just tests and trials
[2:03:41] that's coming my way no god was trying
[2:03:43] to correct them because they had got
[2:03:45] their priorities
[2:03:46] out of line
[2:03:47] and it was the love and mercy of god it
[2:03:49] wasn't god's god doesn't despise us god
[2:03:52] does not hate us you cannot change god's
[2:03:54] love
[2:03:55] for you
[2:03:58] you can't change his thought concerning
[2:04:00] you as a matter of fact he's never had
[2:04:03] a new
[2:04:04] thought
[2:04:08] our thoughts about ourselves have
[2:04:09] changed a lot
[2:04:11] right
[2:04:12] but let's let his thought
[2:04:14] affect our thoughts
[2:04:16] my thoughts are higher
[2:04:19] amen let's pray
[2:04:22] maybe you're sitting next to husband and
[2:04:23] wife or maybe a brother in front of you
[2:04:25] or beside you maybe just reach over a
[2:04:28] husband and wife maybe hand to hand and
[2:04:30] maybe brother to brother sister to
[2:04:32] sister and let's just let's pray
[2:04:36] it's really set in our hearts a real
[2:04:39] a real consecration a real determination
[2:04:42] right now that
[2:04:44] lord from this in this service of what
[2:04:46] you've spoke to our hearts in all these
[2:04:48] services
[2:04:50] we want to be honest in the reflection
[2:04:53] of what we're seeing in the mirror
[2:04:56] and lord
[2:04:57] we want to be
[2:04:59] what you've ordained for us to be
[2:05:02] we don't want that purpose to be
[2:05:04] clouded up and where we've allowed other
[2:05:07] things
[2:05:09] that are a part sometimes of the purpose
[2:05:11] and we've started to allow them to come
[2:05:13] ahead of you
[2:05:16] god i pray this morning lord jesus
[2:05:20] lord for each and
[2:05:22] every one of us and myself included lord
[2:05:26] father
[2:05:28] lord you know as i've looked over this
[2:05:30] lord for weeks and weeks
[2:05:33] when setting right back there lord one
[2:05:35] morning praying in the pew
[2:05:37] and you spoke this thought to my heart
[2:05:40] and as i've examined lord these things
[2:05:42] and just looking and
[2:05:44] certainly not seeing all of this here in
[2:05:46] it but
[2:05:47] i thank you for your mercy when i look
[2:05:49] at these believers here in haggai one
[2:05:53] there was a work that was started in
[2:05:55] their life
[2:05:56] and they became discouraged
[2:05:59] they began to let down
[2:06:02] well they didn't go back to babylon
[2:06:05] they didn't become as it were we could
[2:06:07] say
[2:06:08] sinful
[2:06:09] but unbelief
[2:06:11] had entered in
[2:06:13] and that's what you discerned in their
[2:06:15] life because they were it was unbelief
[2:06:17] in the word of god now
[2:06:20] the time has not now come
[2:06:22] but you discerned that lord and you you
[2:06:25] helped him
[2:06:26] you broke lord by the discernment of the
[2:06:28] word and they received that
[2:06:30] now lord i know there's lives right here
[2:06:32] this morning
[2:06:34] no doubt lord would stream this service
[2:06:37] that there's been a start in their life
[2:06:41] but they've not went all the way
[2:06:43] that's one part of this
[2:06:45] may they lord i pray this morning lord
[2:06:48] just recognize the lord how satan's
[2:06:50] desire has been to derail them
[2:06:53] there's been temptation that's come
[2:06:55] their life that's come their way
[2:06:58] and maybe they've heeded some to that
[2:07:00] temptation but may they not allow that
[2:07:02] failure lord to define them lord
[2:07:08] but may the lord god rise up lord jesus
[2:07:12] under the strength and the vision of the
[2:07:14] word of god
[2:07:16] and say lord
[2:07:18] you started this work in my life
[2:07:21] you're the same god who'll finish it
[2:07:23] lord and i give myself to you lord i
[2:07:26] rise back up in the name of the lord
[2:07:28] jesus christ
[2:07:29] i'm going on
[2:07:32] lord if we've not received the holy
[2:07:33] ghost may that be the press within their
[2:07:36] life that rises up in their soul to
[2:07:39] press on press on little lily press on
[2:07:43] to eternal life
[2:07:46] god i pray this morning lord
[2:07:49] throughout this building lord
[2:07:52] lives the lord
[2:07:55] that can look back maybe certain things
[2:07:57] priorities
[2:07:59] have gotten rearranged in their life
[2:08:04] and they know in their life
[2:08:06] and not what they were
[2:08:08] a month ago
[2:08:10] a year ago
[2:08:13] and we realized as believers lord
[2:08:16] we can't live off a past reputation
[2:08:20] is what is now in our life
[2:08:26] there's things lord that father in the
[2:08:29] past we we see it
[2:08:31] we're things that in the past
[2:08:34] where things would have been stood
[2:08:35] against her this is not done or this and
[2:08:37] then we find
[2:08:39] in present
[2:08:41] oh what's happened
[2:08:43] what's happened
[2:08:44] oh god
[2:08:46] we take of your mercy this morning
[2:08:49] not just not just your mercy lord not
[2:08:52] just saying oh god understands but no
[2:08:55] lord you're opening to us you're showing
[2:08:58] what's really lord what can be taking
[2:09:00] place around our life
[2:09:02] sometimes lord there's correction going
[2:09:04] on
[2:09:06] not always the sickness come for
[2:09:07] correction but sometimes you use it
[2:09:10] sometimes that's why it comes
[2:09:13] but lord i'm grateful you don't leave us
[2:09:15] wondering
[2:09:17] there's a discernment in this hour
[2:09:20] the sacrifice
[2:09:23] has been revealed and we recognize that
[2:09:25] the chastening of the lord is not
[2:09:28] only correction for wrong
[2:09:31] it's correction even
[2:09:33] admonition
[2:09:35] in the season we're in where the word
[2:09:38] will come to direct us for things that
[2:09:41] are to come
[2:09:42] in that coming day coming week coming
[2:09:45] season
[2:09:46] it's not always about where things are
[2:09:48] wrong
[2:09:49] [Music]
[2:09:51] oh god
[2:09:53] granted this morning lord throughout
[2:09:55] this congregation
[2:09:58] help us the lord i pray when as the
[2:10:00] chasing of the lord comes
[2:10:02] through tests and trials lord whether
[2:10:05] this morning it's test it's trial it's
[2:10:07] persecution
[2:10:09] there's correction lord
[2:10:11] but god we want to be in subjection
[2:10:16] we don't want to resist the correction
[2:10:19] we want to receive it lord
[2:10:22] we want to receive correction
[2:10:26] we want to receive it we don't want it
[2:10:28] lord and offer no excuses we want to
[2:10:30] receive correction
[2:10:35] help us lord help each and every one i
[2:10:36] know lord
[2:10:38] there's some setting here they're
[2:10:40] dealing lord with sickness in their body
[2:10:43] no doubt lord god there's things lord
[2:10:45] that
[2:10:46] this as far as with correction maybe
[2:10:48] they could relate to certain things but
[2:10:49] it has nothing to do maybe with
[2:10:51] correction in their life but father you
[2:10:53] don't leave us to wonder
[2:10:55] you minister so personally to our lives
[2:10:58] but we ask you lord for your grace
[2:11:01] now i pray father for us as an entire
[2:11:04] assembly
[2:11:05] [Music]
[2:11:06] dear god
[2:11:08] we cannot live on a picture
[2:11:10] of what we were a month ago
[2:11:13] what we were a year ago
[2:11:17] it won't do no good to complain about it
[2:11:19] your prophet told us complaining only
[2:11:21] weakens faith
[2:11:26] but may we lord god be his sons and
[2:11:28] daughters of god and look into the
[2:11:30] mirror of the word of god
[2:11:32] and say lord jesus
[2:11:35] if we've fallen short in an area lord
[2:11:37] forgive me help me to rise up lord god
[2:11:40] help me lord god to strengthen that area
[2:11:43] lord
[2:11:46] granted lord jesus
[2:11:49] help us lord god like the enemy was
[2:11:51] coming in against israel
[2:11:52] hezekiah begin to strengthen and fortify
[2:11:56] certain parts of the wall
[2:12:00] lord god as things come around it begins
[2:12:02] to show us
[2:12:03] maybe where there's little chinks in our
[2:12:05] armor
[2:12:08] gives us grace lord god to be able to
[2:12:10] tighten up the buckle
[2:12:12] lord help us i pray
[2:12:15] help us
[2:12:17] lord we're standing here the desire
[2:12:20] is one of these mornings
[2:12:23] that god when that sweep would come over
[2:12:26] the very atoms of these bodies would
[2:12:29] change
[2:12:30] just as the sweet come over our soul
[2:12:33] and brought a change
[2:12:36] in our nature
[2:12:38] we shall also change our vile bodies
[2:12:41] lord i asked father
[2:12:44] may we be able lord as children of god
[2:12:48] be able to say lord god
