[34:09] tonight
[34:10] amen brought your lick of fire with you
[34:15] amen you know I want to say first of all
[34:18] it's so good to have each and every one
[34:21] of you it's a real blessing to have the
[34:24] visitors here in our gates and what a
[34:27] privilege it is is amen it's just
[34:30] wonderful to see God's people amen that
[34:33] you would take time to come and share in
[34:37] this moment with us because after all
[34:40] when God has really spoke to your heart
[34:42] and touched your life you realize I'm a
[34:45] stranger and I'm a pilgrim in this world
[34:47] that's right and you realize that your
[34:49] real family is the family of
[34:52] God Amen it's just something to me it's
[34:55] always special with that you can meet
[34:57] somebody the very first time another
[35:00] believer but it's like you've known him
[35:02] forever and actually it's more than
[35:05] forever we go back clear back to the
[35:07] mind of
[35:10] God you've heard people sometimes say we
[35:13] go way back well we go way
[35:16] back and we go back to that reality of
[35:20] sons of God who were shouting for
[35:23] Joy amen I believe that we are the
[35:26] living Witnesses
[35:28] of what was in God's mind yes sir and
[35:31] we're expressing that Joy what the
[35:33] prophets longed for that's right amen
[35:36] they prophesied of Calvary prophesied of
[35:39] the
[35:39] Resurrection but it was also looking
[35:42] forward to this day when there would be
[35:45] an ending and a wrapping up of all
[35:47] things we know Israel is only waiting on
[35:49] us to get out of the way right and what
[35:53] a time that God has given to you and I
[35:56] in this hour I tell you you hear the
[35:59] prophet make these statements this is
[36:01] bride time that's right it's declaring
[36:04] that the word of God that has come in
[36:06] this hour it's come to lead us into full
[36:10] adoption that's the that's the that's
[36:12] the product of this word to bring forth
[36:15] Sons and Daughters of God a complete
[36:18] Union with
[36:19] God Amen and so when we think of that in
[36:23] this moment that hey we're living in a
[36:25] time that at any moment wow any moment
[36:29] you can look and see your loved ones
[36:31] appear we we're we're just we're that
[36:33] close we're living in that hour and God
[36:36] is working in everything and bringing it
[36:38] all together you know as I was just
[36:42] thinking of that when we think of that
[36:44] thought of bride time and just coming
[36:47] into this this service you know here
[36:50] tonight I just thinking of the word
[36:53] expectation and you
[36:55] know we always get what we
[36:58] expect and you know it's things that
[37:01] every one of us have gathered here there
[37:03] are needs that we have there are needs
[37:06] that maybe you have personally needs
[37:08] that maybe you're praying about for
[37:10] another loved one or someone God
[37:14] knows and I I think tonight as brother
[37:17] BR says if we can approach
[37:19] it fearfully and reverently and that
[37:23] means Lord if there's anything anything
[37:26] that I've said are done any unconfessed
[37:29] sin settle it right now settle it that
[37:33] the spirit of God can just move right
[37:35] down and meet and minister to every need
[37:38] this meeting I want you to think of this
[37:40] every one of us are here we may not be
[37:42] the same gathering on Sunday but I want
[37:45] you to think of it in this way make this
[37:47] meeting your
[37:50] meeting make this meeting your meeting
[37:54] don't let it just don't let it pass you
[37:55] by but God I've got needs there is an
[37:58] expectation that I have and I've come to
[38:00] draw from elhi
[38:03] tonight amen I believe that God has set
[38:07] aside a gift and it's not it's not
[38:10] brother Wendell but the gift lays there
[38:13] God knows he'll prepare a man
[38:14] experiences and all the way down through
[38:17] and things that God will show that man
[38:19] and even the the perspective and the
[38:21] angle God prepares it for just a
[38:24] moment and you know God does it in that
[38:26] way because God just doesn't give it all
[38:28] to just one man he could do that but God
[38:32] wants to show and continue to declare
[38:35] that he's God so God works through a
[38:38] many faceted body a five-fold Ministry
[38:43] and God comes and he brings his word and
[38:46] the prophet said when you've got a
[38:48] craving in your heart and there's
[38:50] something you begin to pray about he
[38:51] said you watch God will send a man to
[38:54] the pulpit that will begin to minister
[38:57] to The Desires in your heart and that's
[39:00] the moment at that time to reach up and
[39:01] say Lord I take it and to accept what
[39:05] God has for us here tonight you don't
[39:07] have to you don't have to barter with
[39:08] God he's already taken care of whatever
[39:11] your need is tonight he's already paid
[39:14] for he's already paid for it's just us
[39:17] to accept what he's already done and I
[39:21] believe that tonight I'll tell you the
[39:23] prophet told us to ask for big things
[39:26] I'm asking for big things I've been
[39:27] asking for big
[39:29] things praying for these meetings how
[39:32] many are asking for big things I'm
[39:34] asking for God to meet every single
[39:37] need I'm asking for God to fill every
[39:39] life with the Holy Ghost and Grant a
[39:41] refilling of his Spirit I'm asking God
[39:44] to heal every every disease every
[39:48] sickness amen amen and you know what if
[39:52] he does everything and does meets every
[39:55] single need it will not not diminish him
[39:58] one ioda he's still the same almighty

[1:05:43] the trustees musicians and just everyone
[1:05:49] Lord be welcome here this weekend
[1:05:52] father we'll give you glory and honor
[1:05:55] Hallelujah help us as we open your word
[1:05:57] and just ask that you would speak to us
[1:06:00] now in Jesus
[1:06:02] name can the church say amen
[1:06:05] amen I'd like to read in two places I'd
[1:06:08] like to look here in Mark the 17th
[1:06:11] chapter and the 20 or the the 11th
[1:06:14] chapter and the 22nd
[1:06:16] verse and um I uh this is a very
[1:06:20] familiar passage of
[1:06:22] scripture and then I'd also like to read
[1:06:25] in another very familiar passage and
[1:06:27] that is in Romans the 8th
[1:06:31] chapter and
[1:06:35] um we bring our greetings and love from
[1:06:38] our congregation there in in Pony
[1:06:42] Oklahoma and
[1:06:44] um uh there were several that wish they
[1:06:47] could have came and been a part but um
[1:06:51] we bring our greetings from
[1:06:53] them there remark 11 and 20 uh
[1:06:59] 22 and Jesus answering Sith unto them
[1:07:03] have faith in God for verily I say unto
[1:07:07] you that whosoever shall say unto this
[1:07:10] mountain be thou removed and be thou
[1:07:12] cast into the sea and shall not doubt in
[1:07:15] his heart but shall believe that those
[1:07:18] things which he saith shall come to pass
[1:07:21] he shall have whatsoever he
[1:07:23] saith therefore I say unto you to you
[1:07:26] what so what things soever you desire
[1:07:29] When you pray believe that you receive
[1:07:33] them and you shall have
[1:07:36] them can somebody say Amen to the word
[1:07:40] I'd also like to read here in the Book
[1:07:42] of Romans the 8th
[1:07:44] chapter
[1:07:46] amen and
[1:07:48] um we're going to start about the 11th
[1:07:54] verse PR the Lord amen amen and um and
[1:07:59] when you're there you can say amen amen
[1:08:02] all right it says but if the spirit of
[1:08:06] him that raised up Jesus from the dead
[1:08:11] dwell in you he that raised up Christ
[1:08:15] from the dead shall also Quicken your
[1:08:18] mortal bodies by his spirit that
[1:08:21] dwelleth in you therefore brethren we
[1:08:23] are not debtors we are matters not to
[1:08:26] the flesh to live after the flesh for if
[1:08:28] you live after the flesh you shall die
[1:08:31] but if you through the spirit do mortify
[1:08:33] the Deeds of the body you shall live for
[1:08:36] as many as are led by the spirit of God
[1:08:38] they are the sons of God for ye have not
[1:08:41] received the spirit of bondage again to
[1:08:43] fear but you have received the spirit of
[1:08:45] adoption whereby we cry ABA father the
[1:08:49] spirit itself bearing witness with our
[1:08:52] spirit that we are the children of God
[1:08:54] and if children than heirs HS of God
[1:08:56] join HS with Christ if so be that we
[1:08:58] suffer with him we shall also be
[1:09:00] glorified together for I reckon that the
[1:09:04] suffering of this present time are not
[1:09:06] worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:09:08] which shall be revealed in us for the
[1:09:11] earnest expectation of the creature
[1:09:15] waits for the
[1:09:16] manifestation of the sons of God can I
[1:09:20] hear an
[1:09:22] amen let's bow our heads once again
[1:09:25] father we want to thank you again for
[1:09:27] the reading of your word we're just
[1:09:29] asking Lord that you would just anoint
[1:09:31] it to our hearts in Jesus name we pray
[1:09:35] can the church say amen amen and amen
[1:09:38] God bless you you can be seated here
[1:09:40] tonight I want to minister this evening
[1:09:43] on a simple
[1:09:45] thought amen positioned to
[1:09:49] Reign position to rain now if we're
[1:09:52] going to do any kind of reigning God god
[1:09:55] reigns by
[1:09:57] faith God does not Reign by force he
[1:10:00] does not act he is he is the
[1:10:03] creator amen he is he is God that's
[1:10:08] right amen and when it says have faith
[1:10:11] in God if you were to look there in your
[1:10:13] margin on the side it says have the
[1:10:16] faith of God so we're going to speak
[1:10:18] tonight on that Faith because amen the
[1:10:23] scripture says faith is the substance of
[1:10:25] things hoped for the evidence of things
[1:10:28] that are not
[1:10:30] seen but without faith it is impossible
[1:10:34] to please him for he that cometh to God
[1:10:38] must first believe that he is and that
[1:10:41] he is a rewarder of them who diligently
[1:10:44] seek Him amen and so coming under the
[1:10:48] Authority or coming under the headship
[1:10:51] of the word be requires a surrendered
[1:10:55] heart and a faith that says I believe
[1:11:00] the
[1:11:01] word I'm not going by emotions I'm not
[1:11:03] going off of what amen a a certain this
[1:11:08] or a certain feeling here or a good
[1:11:10] service there or an anointed preacher
[1:11:12] here I have got one thing that I'm
[1:11:15] interested in I've got one thing that I
[1:11:18] must come to to grips with and that God
[1:11:23] never lies
[1:11:26] I can put my faith and my confidence in
[1:11:28] that amen everything else gifts will
[1:11:31] fail men will fail amen everything else
[1:11:34] will fail but God's word cannot fail
[1:11:38] there's no failing to it can you say
[1:11:41] amen and only faith can meet the
[1:11:43] challenge of the day amen faith is the
[1:11:46] only thing that can meet the challenge
[1:11:48] when the powers of Darkness are there to
[1:11:50] challenge your faith we need something
[1:11:54] that'll anchor us and that'll put us in
[1:11:58] that Bedrock solid position that God has
[1:12:01] ordained for his bride in this last day
[1:12:05] I say what an incredible day we live in
[1:12:08] amen we' you know we've seen the virus
[1:12:10] and the amen the economy tanking and we
[1:12:13] got a former president that you know
[1:12:15] they there you know he's in you know he
[1:12:17] he's he's uh uh you know in court and
[1:12:21] we've got uh uh you know we've got a
[1:12:23] president that we've got now wondering
[1:12:26] you know we we just amen we just there's
[1:12:29] just a lot of things to wonder about in
[1:12:31] life amen a lot of things to wonder
[1:12:33] about amen and and and you're wondering
[1:12:36] how am I going to raise a family how am
[1:12:38] I going to amen and the sad thing is is
[1:12:40] I found it lots of times in our in in
[1:12:43] the church I found a lot of of of of uh
[1:12:45] fear and and what if and and I don't
[1:12:48] know what I'm going to do and I don't
[1:12:50] know where we're going to do and amen
[1:12:52] and and and we we we we look at these
[1:12:54] things as if God can't take care of our
[1:12:56] battles and that God doesn't know that's
[1:12:58] going on I want to tell you God seen it
[1:13:00] before the world was ever created God
[1:13:04] seen God seen Trump God seen amen Biden
[1:13:07] God seen the virus God seen your economy
[1:13:09] God knows what job you're you're at God
[1:13:12] knows how to raise your family God knows
[1:13:14] how to Rapture you God knows how to
[1:13:15] bring you what can you say Amen but it's
[1:13:18] going to require a faith a confidence in
[1:13:20] God saying that God never fails he can
[1:13:24] somebody saying God cannot
[1:13:27] fail man it's a Beggar's mentality the
[1:13:31] hope that God will somehow feel sorry
[1:13:33] for us and have compassion upon us it's
[1:13:35] a Beggar's mentality to say if the angel
[1:13:38] of the Lord would just somehow stop by
[1:13:40] Ohio and help me here I want to tell you
[1:13:43] tonight God's got Sons God's got
[1:13:47] daughters that are here in Ohio that he
[1:13:51] is positioned to stand up on this word

[1:15:05] that but but but and he wants to dumb
[1:15:07] down the word of God for this generation

[1:15:41] would be nice amen we shall speak to
[1:15:45] this mountain and this mountain shall be
[1:15:50] moved now in the first
[1:15:53] Exodus Israel did not leave Egypt
[1:15:57] defeated in that first Exodus amen there
[1:16:01] was a spoiling of the
[1:16:04] enemy Hallelujah there was no weakness
[1:16:08] around among them the Bible says they
[1:16:10] all left and there was not one weak or
[1:16:13] feeble among them
[1:16:16] Hallelujah now now out of two and a half
[1:16:19] million people there had to been plenty
[1:16:20] of babies there had to been plenty of
[1:16:22] pregnant women there had to been a bunch
[1:16:23] of old people but the Bible says there
[1:16:26] was not one
[1:16:29] weak in the second in the second Exodus
[1:16:33] amen we found that the Son of God was
[1:16:36] there displaying his power and authority
[1:16:39] amen Jesus Christ was coming and leading
[1:16:42] them out of of of Judaism and showing
[1:16:46] them the power of a son in his
[1:16:51] position that's right amen hallelujah

[1:16:56] son who knew who he was I want to tell
[1:17:00] you when the Devils looked at that man
[1:17:01] he wasn't just seeing amen a man but it
[1:17:05] was God who put his authority Upon A man
[1:17:10] I want to say in this Third Exodus I
[1:17:12] might not be the Virgin born son of God
[1:17:14] but I am the redeemed of that virgin
[1:17:17] born son of God and I just want to let
[1:17:19] the devil know tonight that there are
[1:17:22] some people here on this Earth that is
[1:17:25] coming back into their position and they
[1:17:27] know who they are I'm telling you

[1:29:01] secret you missed a really good
[1:29:03] opportunity to

[1:29:10] says now he said this this boy could not
[1:29:13] the disciples had power Jesus gave them
[1:29:15] power to heal all manner of sickness and
[1:29:17] to cast out devils and to cleanse the
[1:29:18] lepers and raise the dead he gave them
[1:29:20] power but they didn't have the faith to
[1:29:22] operate the power they had
[1:29:24] and when they questioned Jesus and said
[1:29:26] well now why couldn't we do it now
[1:29:28] remember they had the word the word was
[1:29:32] flesh then and the word told them I give
[1:29:37] you
[1:29:40] power can you say amen amen then he
[1:29:44] stops he says amen I give you power and
[1:29:47] they had the power but they didn't have
[1:29:49] the faith to operate the word that was
[1:29:51] in them see what I mean Jesus had it he
[1:29:54] was the word and he had the faith and
[1:29:57] that's what he said would happen he said
[1:29:59] oh bring him here how long will I suffer
[1:30:01] you he had the Faith with his power how
[1:30:04] did he he says I can do nothing in
[1:30:06] myself why he relied upon what he was he
[1:30:09] relied in knowing that he was the word
[1:30:12] he had the faith in God who made him the
[1:30:15] word he was God Amen and and they he
[1:30:18] says they was in him and that give him
[1:30:22] Faith because he understood his position
[1:30:25] he knew what he was because the
[1:30:26] scriptures said that's what he was and
[1:30:29] here every scripture tied in to prove he
[1:30:32] was exactly what the scriptures said he
[1:30:35] would be he knew what he was he relied

[1:41:24] Devils knew who Jesus
[1:41:31] was in our first quote that we
[1:41:37] read they looked at Jesus and said well

[1:41:46] and us right we tried and tried and
[1:41:48] tried and tried and tried and stomped
[1:41:49] and tried and stomped we

[1:41:56] was he looked in scripture said amen

[1:42:02] for they had
[1:42:07] power but they could not
[1:42:10] recognize
[1:42:12] themselves Beyond sexual
[1:42:16] born
[1:42:17] humans Hallelujah but the new
[1:42:21] birth wipes out
[1:42:23] yes it
[1:42:24] does
[1:42:27] it the soul was not sexually born the

[1:50:32] speaking it's not me it's the father
[1:50:34] that dwelleth in me he doeth The Works
[1:50:36] see what I mean now the identification
[1:50:38] of a scripture Christian these words
[1:50:40] said Jesus these signs shall follow them
[1:50:44] that believe now you can call yourself a
[1:50:46] Believer a people and deny those words
[1:50:48] how can you call yourself a Believer and
[1:50:50] deny any of this word you can't do it
[1:50:52] you're not a Believer therefore the
[1:50:54] signs can't follow but because you are
[1:50:56] you just said uh you just accept what
[1:50:58] you want to believe and then let out the
[1:51:00] rest you don't believe it but you got to
[1:51:02] take the whole thing and believe it and
[1:51:04] when you truly believe not make believe
[1:51:05] but really believe then these signs
[1:51:07] shall follow them that
[1:51:09] believe
[1:51:12] hallu oh could you compare a Christian
[1:51:14] today with them Christians long ago that
[1:51:16] them disciples walk in the power of the
[1:51:18] spirit moved by the Holy Ghost amen just
[1:51:21] a a prisoner as I preached the other
[1:51:22] night a prisoner to the word and with
[1:51:24] the will of God he couldn't even move

[1:51:27] see a church rise like that and then he
[1:51:30] stops wouldn't you like to see a church
[1:51:32] rise like that and then he
[1:51:37] stops and he says I wish it could happen

[1:52:13] act like I'm at
[1:52:16] home some of those folks from home
[1:52:19] they're going that's the wrong thing to
[1:52:20] say
[1:52:22] amen that's right what was the first law
[1:52:25] of God
[1:52:27] faith that first law that first law God
[1:52:31] believe God
[1:52:33] seen God
[1:52:35] spoke it was
[1:52:37] settled can you say Amen am amen the
[1:52:42] scripture the prophet would tell us and
[1:52:44] who is God Amen how did he make it from
[1:52:46] he said I don't know there was nothing
[1:52:47] to make it from but he believed his own
[1:52:50] word and there was light right right
[1:52:52] amen and when you start believing your
[1:52:54] own
[1:52:56] word well glory to God the genetics of
[1:53:00] God are am am I going around in circles
[1:53:01] too much or am I doing okay here the
[1:53:03] genetics of God are on the inside of you
[1:53:05] and I want you to understand that when
[1:53:07] you you've got the genetics I don't I
[1:53:09] don't care amen every predestinated seed
[1:53:11] has got the genetics the problem today
[1:53:13] is is the church or the message circles
[1:53:17] have taken away the baptism of the Holy
[1:53:20] Ghost and we've been dealing with that
[1:53:21] in the church is back at at the church
[1:53:23] and he deals that amen with that in that
[1:53:25] second Church age he says we've got some
[1:53:28] that is in the fanaticism and they're
[1:53:30] putting it all on the
[1:53:32] gifts he says that could be or could not
[1:53:36] be the Holy Ghost we it's Satan can
[1:53:39] manifest he says but then others have
[1:53:42] put it all on
[1:53:43] experience and how many times have I
[1:53:45] heard message preachers preach against
[1:53:48] experience but go back and read it when
[1:53:50] brother Bram when he says away with EXP
[1:53:52] experience he's not even getting on to
[1:53:54] the Pentecostals he goes he says you
[1:53:57] won't go on from believing unto the Holy
[1:54:01] Ghost to receiving the Holy Ghost that's
[1:54:05] the full
[1:54:09] quote come on that's right these guys is
[1:54:12] preaching against experience as if it's
[1:54:14] a bunch of fanaticism that's not what
[1:54:16] brother Brandon was coming
[1:54:18] against that's right that's right he
[1:54:21] said we got too many former
[1:54:23] folks in here says I just believe and
[1:54:25] brother brandham dealt pages on
[1:54:31] that scripture after scripture after
[1:54:33] scripture after scripture on
[1:54:39] that so what we have today is a lot of
[1:54:44] seeds laying in a lot of wounds on that
[1:54:48] need some
[1:54:50] igniting and I want to tell you this
[1:54:52] evening yes sir if there's some people
[1:54:54] in here that don't have the baptism of
[1:54:56] the Holy Ghost on I want to tell you the
[1:54:59] baptism of the Holy Ghost is here for
[1:55:00] you tonight you can receive you say oh
[1:55:04] brother W I believe I listen we got to
[1:55:06] get past amen justification we got well
[1:55:09] I believe I have you received the Holy
[1:55:12] Ghost since you have
[1:55:15] believed the reason why the word isn't
[1:55:17] working in a lot of people because they
[1:55:19] ain't got the Holy Ghost
[1:55:22] that doesn't say the word's not in you
[1:55:23] you're elected you're predestinated but
[1:55:25] you need to get yourself into an upper
[1:55:28] room and get filled with the baptism of
[1:55:30] the Holy Ghost so that you can get
[1:55:32] ignited by the word of God so that the
[1:55:34] power of the Holy Spirit can flow
[1:55:36] through
[1:55:37] [Applause]

[2:08:57] about like a bunch of preachers

[2:09:01] they don't nothing

[2:09:38] these Seven Ages up to this point to get
[2:09:42] a
[2:09:44] people who will reflect who he is
[2:09:51] Hallelujah well glory to
[2:09:53] God isn't that just
[2:09:57] wonderful there is an authority hallu
[2:10:00] coming under that Authority brother
[2:10:01] Brandon would ask he man he says now I
[2:10:05] wonder if we're sufficiently impressed
[2:10:07] with the word in our
[2:10:10] midst I wonder if we're sufficiently
[2:10:13] impressed we talk about the
[2:10:15] word we debate
[2:10:18] it can you say
[2:10:20] Amen but he but he goes on and he says
[2:10:22] but the printed word he says the word
[2:10:24] that he's left behind on the printed
[2:10:26] page is a part of him and when you
[2:10:27] accept it by faith into a spirit filled
[2:10:30] life he goes on down and says there it
[2:10:33] is he is Spirit he is life that's
[2:10:35] exactly what the word is that's exactly
[2:10:36] what Jesus is he is the word so when a
[2:10:39] spirit born Spirit-filled man in faith
[2:10:43] takes the word into his heart places it
[2:10:46] upon his lips why that is the same as
[2:10:49] deity speaking Every Mountain has to go
[2:10:53] Satan cannot stand before that man can I
[2:10:56] hear a great big
[2:11:00] amen pretty plain and
[2:11:03] simple now as I
[2:11:06] close the
[2:11:08] word what did what did God what what
[2:11:11] when when brother when God was trying to
[2:11:14] show brother
[2:11:16] brandham what his message was and he was
[2:11:18] having a hard time understanding what
[2:11:21] what was the vision

[2:13:24] another five minutes yes sir he was he

[2:13:30] that there was not a sword found in all
[2:13:33] of the
[2:13:35] Kingdom the only swords that there
[2:13:39] were
[2:13:41] was uh uh
[2:13:44] Saul and
[2:13:46] Jonathan they were the only ones that
[2:13:48] had
[2:13:49] swords the Philistines had taken every
[2:13:54] sword every spear they had taken
[2:13:58] everything
[2:13:59] away from Israel
[2:14:02] right Saul had a
[2:14:06] sword but Saul was scared to use
[2:14:11] it and then you read the SC you read the
[2:14:14] story how that they were the Philistines
[2:14:18] there the Bible says there was not even
[2:14:20] a black Smith found in all of
[2:14:24] Israel if they needed anything sharpened
[2:14:27] or anything made they had to go to the
[2:14:31] enemy and you think the enemy is going
[2:14:33] to give them anything
[2:14:35] sharp the enemy is going to keep them
[2:14:37] beat
[2:14:39] down and the Bible says they were all
[2:14:41] gathered together boy saw that the
[2:14:44] Philistines were down there and the saw
[2:14:45] was scared and they he you know and he
[2:14:47] didn't know amen and he's calling them

[2:14:55] nothing to come on they were picking up
[2:14:57] little rocks like little

[2:15:06] retreating hul go back he looked down
[2:15:11] there and he saw
[2:15:15] Jonathan and his armor bear and if you
[2:15:19] read the story
[2:15:21] Jonathan looked to his armor bear and
[2:15:23] says I see those Philistines over there
[2:15:25] he says I think we can take them armor
[2:15:28] Bearer says well all I've got is your
[2:15:30] sword I ain't got I'm with

[2:15:37] think you can whoop him I'll be right
[2:15:39] there with

[2:15:46] got into the enemy's camp and they
[2:15:49] were who
[2:15:52] that's a southern
[2:15:54] whing they were whopping those demons
[2:15:59] Philistines they were flying every which
[2:16:01] time ding ding ding and Saul looks down
[2:16:05] there and he's trying to
[2:16:06] find the two missing
[2:16:09] Fellers and he says what on
[2:16:13] Earth is happening down there with the
[2:16:18] Philistines so good they looked around
[2:16:20] and they said say well Jonathan and his
[2:16:21] armor bear is missing

[2:33:12] so
[2:33:16] God I'm going to sing that last verse
[2:33:19] again
[2:33:21] you know we can we can really relate to
[2:33:25] that this is why God had to restore the
[2:33:29] word in this
[2:33:33] hour to break away all the
[2:33:36] veils of
[2:33:38] tradition everything that we thought
[2:33:42] about
[2:33:43] ourselves everything that we
[2:33:46] knew it had to be a voice that would
[2:33:48] come From Another
[2:33:51] World a voice of a seminary could never
[2:33:54] do it man's thinking couldn't do it
[2:33:58] there's nothing that can bring the
[2:33:59] liberating power like the voice of
[2:34:02] almighty God Amen and you know what that
[2:34:05] voice called him to do think about it
[2:34:07] that little Eagle he was an eagle the
[2:34:09] whole time but he had been trying to act
[2:34:11] like a chicken that's what he had been
[2:34:12] told to
[2:34:14] do but the prophet Ali says it's so
[2:34:16] simple he said when that that eagle he
[2:34:18] said he he never never never never
[2:34:20] forgot about him he said that eagle
[2:34:23] begin to Circle that
[2:34:25] barnyard maybe he took and preached 10
[2:34:28] parts and just kept on
[2:34:30] circling kept on circling because down
[2:34:33] there is an eagle and God in this
[2:34:36] generation God has circled over this
[2:34:40] generation you know what the thing that
[2:34:42] eagle had to do just like for you and I
[2:34:44] had to look up and there was something
[2:34:47] that caught its attention
[2:34:49] and that's why brother BR said in the
[2:34:51] rising of the sun he said just to talk
[2:34:53] about eagles or a picture of an eagle
[2:34:55] was not good enough it took the eagle
[2:34:58] himself to come flying over
[2:35:01] us that presence of God that you sense
[2:35:03] right here tonight that's the Great
[2:35:06] Eagle of God that's Jehovah Eagle
[2:35:09] stirring up the nest stirring your heart
[2:35:13] letting you know this is who you really
[2:35:16] are this is your true identity
[2:35:19] it's found in him you'll never find it
[2:35:21] in the world Amen the world always leave
[2:35:24] you searching and grabbing for the next
[2:35:25] thing but in him amen you'll find
[2:35:29] satisfaction because you find who you
[2:35:31] really are in him is
[2:35:36] rest I didn't know how to fly I didn't
[2:35:38] know where to start but you know what it
[2:35:41] starts with just like Mama Eagle said
[2:35:44] just get up just come on up here he
[2:35:46] jumped up on the fence post hey he made
[2:35:48] a start there you go he jumped up on the
[2:35:51] fence post she the encouragement kept
[2:35:55] coming
[2:35:57] eventually he was no longer on the fence

[2:36:01] air this is where he was born to
[2:36:04] fly listen you weren't Born to Live
[2:36:07] underneath
