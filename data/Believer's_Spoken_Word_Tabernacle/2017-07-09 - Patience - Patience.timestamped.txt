[38:56] brother and then each of us through the
[38:57] family just as I woke up on Tuesday

[39:39] Wednesday morning they're just in prayer
[39:41] and the Lord just really just begin to
[39:44] speak to my heart and I'll tell you

[53:54] of God amen
[53:57] perfect meeting your Bibles if you would
[53:59] to Hebrews chapter 6 I'd like to read
[54:02] Hebrews chapter 6 verse 11 through 15
[54:23] we desire that every one of you should
[54:26] shew the same diligence to the full
[54:29] assurance of hope unto the end that you
[54:33] be not slothful but followers of them
[54:35] who through faith and patience inherit
[54:38] the promise
[54:40] but when God have made a promise to
[54:43] Abraham because he could swear by no
[54:45] greater he swear by himself saying
[54:48] surely blessing I will bless thee
[54:51] multiplying I will multiply thee and so
[54:54] after he had patiently endured he
[54:57] obtained the promise now if you could
[55:00] turn me to Hebrews chapter 10 I want to
[55:03] read verses 35 and 36 cast not away
[55:14] therefore your confidence which hath
[55:17] great recompense of reward for you have
[55:20] need of patience that after you've done
[55:22] the will of God you might receive the
[55:24] promise you may be seated I want to
[55:32] speak on patience it's something we all
[55:37] have need of it's something that this
[55:42] world doesn't have the message of the
[55:48] Queen of Sheba brother Branham says the
[55:51] only way you can be saved is by faith
[55:54] you've got to look at the unseen and the
[55:59] whole armor of Christianity is
[56:01] supernatural how that a man can say that
[56:04] he believes in God and preaches in a
[56:07] church and says he does not believe in
[56:09] the supernatural when the full armor of
[56:11] God the full armor of Christianity is
[56:14] supernatural
[56:16] what is the armor of Christianity love
[56:19] joy peace longsuffering goodness
[56:22] meekness patience faith Holy Spirit all
[56:24] those things are supernatural what is
[56:27] love what is joy go down to the
[56:31] drugstore and buy me a quarters worth of
[56:33] it
[56:34] by me a quarters worth of patience I
[56:36] need it right now
[56:38] you can't buy love joy peace
[56:40] longsuffering goodness patience
[56:43] gentleness and faith you can't buy it
[56:45] it's supernatural and the whole armor of
[56:48] Christian is supernatural worth bidden
[56:54] by the scriptures to put on the whole
[56:55] armour of God be girded about the whole
[56:58] armour if we could if it can be bought
[57:06] then people would be buying it but then
[57:12] maybe not this world is set up on the
[57:16] one and everything faster faster faster
[57:18] faster faster I can remember with my
[57:24] first computer when I got it
[57:26] why it had to think a while when I was
[57:29] looking up something and I used to joke
[57:34] that there was a man in there
[57:36] chiseling everything out in rock how
[57:40] slow it was then I got a better computer
[57:45] and it was a little faster and then
[57:47] faster computers came out then the
[57:50] internet came out and it was on dial-up
[57:53] and sometimes you'd drop your connection
[57:57] but you'd have to if you researched
[58:00] anything and looked up anything it would
[58:01] be a while that it'd be searching before
[58:03] it could bring something up and then it
[58:05] would take a while to even load it and
[58:09] if it had pictures on it forget about it
[58:12] and then you know they developed faster
[58:16] and faster ways and yet people are still
[58:19] not satisfied they want it faster than
[58:22] fast I was standing in line at
[58:26] McDonald's one day and heard can people
[58:29] complaining because they weren't getting
[58:31] their food fast enough it's a fast food
[58:35] restaurant you're getting it as fast as
[58:37] they can put it out
[58:39] they're back there working you know but
[58:44] they wanted even faster maybe they
[58:48] should go to a machine where they can
[58:49] just put in money and pull out a
[58:51] sandwich or something but impatience and
[58:58] this young generation has come up why
[59:01] they're even more impatient they want to
[59:04] grow up right now they want to be out on
[59:07] their own right now they want to be have
[59:10] their say over what they're going to do
[59:12] right now
[59:14] they turned fifteen years old they want
[59:17] to be 18 and they can't wait until they
[59:21] get old enough to move out and be on
[59:22] their own and some of them will even do
[59:26] it before they get old mouth just can't
[59:30] wait I remember my grandmother telling
[59:34] me don't loose your life away and when I
[59:38] was 15 wanting to be 16 I didn't really
[59:41] understand what she meant by that now at
[59:45] the age of 54 I realized what she means
[59:47] if I don't wish your life away let's
[59:53] read from Luke 21 19
[1:00:12] Luke 21 verse 19 in your patience
[1:00:17] possess ye your souls in your patience
[1:00:22] possess you your souls it takes patience
[1:00:25] to have self-control takes patience to
[1:00:29] have forgiveness perseverance humility
[1:00:31] an impatient person does not possess or
[1:00:35] control their soul their soul is
[1:00:37] possessed by impatience anger greed
[1:00:40] revenge hatred doubt self caused
[1:00:43] ignorance and blindness among the things
[1:00:47] Christians may have to face our
[1:00:49] indifference on the part of others
[1:00:50] reproach misrepresentation intense
[1:00:55] hostility hatred even sometimes among
[1:00:58] relative family mistreatment
[1:01:04] this calls for endurance without this
[1:01:07] essential quality a person simply could
[1:01:10] not come into possession of eternal life
[1:01:14] this is because it counts what counts as
[1:01:17] the finish not the start
[1:01:21] jesus said he that endureth till the end
[1:01:24] for the random citizen to Philadelphia
[1:01:32] in church age is quoting from
[1:01:35] revelations 3 and 10 said because thou
[1:01:38] has kept the word of my patience I also
[1:01:41] will keep thee from the hour of
[1:01:44] temptation which shall come upon all the
[1:01:48] world to try them that dwell upon the
[1:01:54] earth what does he mean by the word of
[1:01:57] his patience Hebrews 16 13 through 15
[1:02:01] for when God made a promise to Abraham
[1:02:04] because he could swear by no greater he
[1:02:06] swear by himself saying surely blessing
[1:02:08] I will bless thee multiply and I will
[1:02:10] multiply thee and so after he had
[1:02:13] patiently endured he obtained the
[1:02:14] promise you see the Spirit is speaking
[1:02:17] about the Word of God which is given to
[1:02:19] us to wait for the fulfillment of the
[1:02:22] word required patience even as it did in
[1:02:25] the
[1:02:25] case of abraham he endured as seeing him
[1:02:29] who is invisible he was patient and then
[1:02:33] the word was finally fulfilled this is
[1:02:37] the way God teaches his people patience
[1:02:39] why if he fulfilled his word in physical
[1:02:42] manifestations the very instance you
[1:02:44] prayed you would never learn patience
[1:02:46] but would become more impatient with
[1:02:48] life let me show you this truth more
[1:02:51] fully Hebrews 11:17 by faith Abraham
[1:02:55] when he was tried offered up Isaac and
[1:02:57] he that had received the promises the
[1:03:01] Word of God offered up his only begotten
[1:03:04] Son there it is
[1:03:06] Abraham was tried after he received the
[1:03:09] word of promise
[1:03:10] most think as soon as we pray in Jesus
[1:03:12] name over the good promises of God that
[1:03:16] there could be could not be a trial but
[1:03:19] here it says that Abraham was tried
[1:03:22] after he received the promise God give
[1:03:26] us exceedingly great and precious
[1:03:27] promises he has promised to fulfill them
[1:03:30] he will but from the time we pray until
[1:03:33] the time we get the answer we must learn
[1:03:36] to receive patients into our souls for
[1:03:40] only in patience do we possess life
[1:03:43] there's where he's speaking about
[1:03:45] impatience possess we are souls may God
[1:03:49] help us to learn this lesson even as we
[1:03:51] know the people of the sixth age learn
[1:03:54] patience we read the history of the
[1:03:57] lives of these great Christians what a
[1:04:00] contrast we see between their lives and
[1:04:03] ours for they were so patient and quiet
[1:04:05] and today we are all but overcome and
[1:04:09] over in patience and haste it requires
[1:04:17] patience to be able to endure when
[1:04:21] you're going through a trial
[1:04:23] a test and you know these trials and
[1:04:26] tests there for character building there
[1:04:30] for training it is and sometimes it's
[1:04:35] for correction
[1:04:38] and when we're going through them we
[1:04:42] pray and we are looking for the end of
[1:04:47] it sometimes we wonder how long is this
[1:04:51] gonna take how long is he going to live
[1:04:54] or be in humans we would like it to be
[1:04:58] over quickly but to be Christians we
[1:05:04] must learn to endure and the only way
[1:05:07] you can learn to endure is for you the
[1:05:12] trial to be sometimes long for the
[1:05:16] testing sometimes for you the trial you
[1:05:20] don't see the end of it there are some
[1:05:24] times when your tribe buy something and
[1:05:25] as soon as you're being tried you can
[1:05:27] see the end you can see why you're being
[1:05:30] tried but there are other times you go
[1:05:32] through it to where you can't see the
[1:05:34] andum you don't know what you're
[1:05:38] supposed to learn from it yet
[1:05:40] and it takes patience to wait on God
[1:05:49] when we see someone in our family going
[1:05:53] through something I know myself I'd like
[1:05:55] to jump in and take care of it for them
[1:05:59] but or my church members in this in the
[1:06:03] congregation I'd like to just jump in
[1:06:07] and take care of it for but there's some
[1:06:10] times when there's nothing I can do
[1:06:13] there's times when I don't have the
[1:06:16] answer all I can do is pray for them
[1:06:22] sometimes you think well if I could just
[1:06:24] say something no sometimes it's best if
[1:06:27] you remain silent and just take it to
[1:06:30] the Lord in prayer because the whole
[1:06:32] thing is in God's hands
[1:06:36] and there might be times you think you
[1:06:40] know what you're doing but he knows what
[1:06:42] he's doing that's never a question and
[1:06:49] he knows God sees the beginning from the
[1:06:53] end and he knows it's the devil that
[1:06:58] comes to brains sometimes these
[1:07:00] temptations and these God allows him to
[1:07:04] bring these times of trials sickness
[1:07:09] sometimes can be a trial and you're
[1:07:13] praying and asking for a healing and you
[1:07:15] wonder how long is it's gonna last and
[1:07:18] you know that God can heal you instantly
[1:07:22] you know that God could perform a
[1:07:26] miracle he's the one that created these
[1:07:28] bodies and yet it seems like you're
[1:07:32] healing seems to be beyond you and you
[1:07:36] just wait on the Lord but I can tell you
[1:07:42] this every time that I've been through a
[1:07:45] test that dealt with my health I have
[1:07:49] come out learning something I have come
[1:07:54] out a better Christian I've come out
[1:07:57] stronger and I wouldn't trade to one of
[1:08:01] those times further or an easier route
[1:08:06] when I went through other trials I can
[1:08:11] look and say at times at the end of the
[1:08:13] trial say boy I hope I pass this one cuz
[1:08:16] I really don't want to go through it
[1:08:18] again I don't want to have to take a
[1:08:21] test over again hey older ministers done
[1:08:28] went on used to say that if you if you
[1:08:31] God gives you a test and you fell it
[1:08:34] well you'll just give it to you again
[1:08:37] until you pass it you just have to take
[1:08:40] it over again
[1:08:41] and I've watched people take the same
[1:08:46] test over and over and over when it's a
[1:08:52] testing of your where you're going to
[1:08:56] stand it'll come in different ways but
[1:08:58] it's still the same test when it's a
[1:09:01] testing of whether you're going to put
[1:09:03] family first or put God first different
[1:09:09] situations it'll come in different
[1:09:11] situations but it'll still be the same
[1:09:13] test when it comes to your faith it can
[1:09:26] come in many different ways it can come
[1:09:28] through illness it could come through
[1:09:29] finances it could come through so many
[1:09:31] different ways and yet it's the same
[1:09:34] test
[1:09:38] he's trying us and he's building
[1:09:42] patience to wait on him for the answer
[1:09:46] to wait on him to bring us through it
[1:09:52] I've been in the midst of a trial to
[1:10:01] where I would
[1:10:02] to put my own hand to it I would try to
[1:10:07] devise the way whereby it would be over
[1:10:14] and I would try to be very clever about
[1:10:17] it and then he wouldn't work out and I
[1:10:24] think Lord this would have been so much
[1:10:26] easier if you'd have done it this way
[1:10:29] but that's the human part of us Lord if
[1:10:33] you'd have done it the way I seen it
[1:10:34] we'd be over this by now
[1:10:39] but you see he's not worried about the
[1:10:44] test or the trial he's not worried about
[1:10:48] whether he can bring you through it or
[1:10:50] not what God is concerned with is what
[1:10:53] happens during it abraham was tried
[1:10:59] first to see if he would believe the
[1:11:03] promise and the promise was given there
[1:11:07] was a time of delay a time between when
[1:11:11] the promise was given and when the
[1:11:13] promise was fulfilled and during that
[1:11:16] time of the delay it's where a lot of
[1:11:19] people fail but he was tested first to
[1:11:24] see if he would believe the promise
[1:11:27] irregardless of what the circumstances
[1:11:30] said as he and Sarah grew older and they
[1:11:34] got beyond the ages of childbearing they
[1:11:40] were beyond the ages of the reproductive
[1:11:43] systems working but would he still
[1:11:47] believe the promise
[1:11:50] [Applause]
[1:11:53] the change in their bodies didn't come
[1:11:56] right away it came because they endured
[1:12:01] because abraham believed the promise and
[1:12:04] in believing the promise it brought
[1:12:07] about the fulfillment of the word but
[1:12:15] then after he received the promise
[1:12:18] sometimes we think I have to receive it
[1:12:20] then the trials over with no Abraham was
[1:12:26] tried even after he received the promise
[1:12:29] what was tried whether he would still
[1:12:33] believe Hebrews chapter 11 verse 8 by
[1:12:50] faith Abraham when he was called to go
[1:12:53] out into a place which he should after
[1:12:55] receive for an inheritance obeyed and he
[1:12:58] went out not knowing whether he went by
[1:13:01] faith he sojourned in the land of
[1:13:03] promise as in a strange land a strange
[1:13:06] country dwelling in Tabernacles with
[1:13:08] Isaac and Jacob the heirs with him of
[1:13:11] the same promise where he looked for a
[1:13:13] city which hath foundations whose
[1:13:15] builder and maker is God through faith
[1:13:18] also Sara herself received strength to
[1:13:21] conceive seed and was delivered of a
[1:13:23] child when she was past age because she
[1:13:26] judged him faithful who had promised
[1:13:30] therefore sprang there even of one and
[1:13:33] him as good as dead so many as the stars
[1:13:37] of the sky in multitude and as the sand
[1:13:40] which is by the seashore innumerable
[1:13:43] these all died in faith not having
[1:13:45] received the promises but having seen
[1:13:47] them afar off and were persuaded of them
[1:13:51] and embraced them and confessed that
[1:13:54] they were strangers and pilgrims on the
[1:13:56] earth
[1:13:58] Abraham knew that Isaac had come from
[1:14:05] the dead in the first place the God from
[1:14:09] the dead in other words their
[1:14:11] reproductive system was dead it was shut
[1:14:14] down on both of them and from that God
[1:14:20] still brought about the promise and
[1:14:22] brought about this son and Abraham seen
[1:14:27] the Bible says that if he could bring
[1:14:29] one from the dead he could raise him
[1:14:32] back up again and so when he was tried
[1:14:34] to see if he would offer his only
[1:14:37] begotten Son he was faithful and obeyed
[1:14:43] the word of the Lord and I'll tell you
[1:14:47] what you sometimes there is a there are
[1:14:50] tests like that
[1:14:52] where it seems like that all is going to
[1:14:56] be lost you look and you see all the
[1:15:00] things that God's given you and then
[1:15:02] sometimes you'll go through a trial
[1:15:04] where it seems like maybe it'll all be
[1:15:06] lost but there was a ram in the thing he
[1:15:15] was Jehovah Jireh
[1:15:18] he provided himself the sacrifice amen
[1:15:39] Psalms 105 19 says until the time that
[1:15:43] his word came the word of God
[1:15:46] tried him this is talking about
[1:15:50] referring to Joseph until the time that
[1:15:53] his word came the word of the Lord tried
[1:15:56] him speaking of Joseph Joseph you think
[1:16:05] about it you know the story he was taken
[1:16:10] by his brothers who were jealous of him
[1:16:12] envious of it and they sold him into
[1:16:17] slavery but something about Joseph
[1:16:22] Joseph never got down Joseph there was
[1:16:30] something about him that hope was always
[1:16:33] there hope of what that God Jehovah
[1:16:39] would take care of him Jehovah had given
[1:16:45] him dreams and in the dream his brothers
[1:16:49] were going to fall down before him
[1:16:53] Joseph believed those dreams he didn't
[1:16:56] know how they would come about and
[1:16:58] Joseph wasn't looking at the dreams in a
[1:17:01] way of trying to lift himself up he
[1:17:05] wasn't looking at the dreams in a way of
[1:17:07] having what we would call a big head
[1:17:09] than him wanting to see his brothers die
[1:17:13] before him he's looking at us God showed
[1:17:15] him something he didn't completely
[1:17:17] understand it or how it would come about
[1:17:19] but he believed that it would be Joseph
[1:17:22] had to keep faith through everything
[1:17:25] that he went through and every and the
[1:17:28] reason that you see kept faith was in
[1:17:31] every situation
[1:17:33] God still blessed him
[1:17:39] even when Potiphar's wife falsely
[1:17:43] accused him then he went to prison God
[1:17:49] still blessed him there and you look at
[1:17:58] it and say how was he ever going to get
[1:18:01] to the right hand of Pharaoh when
[1:18:05] Joseph's case the way up was down
[1:18:10] humility humble himself and he was
[1:18:16] patient to wait Joseph couldn't see what
[1:18:21] was going to happen from one situation
[1:18:23] to the next he didn't know when he was
[1:18:28] first given to Potiphar why as he was
[1:18:32] blessed Potiphar was blessed Joseph
[1:18:35] didn't see what the next step was going
[1:18:37] to be when he was thrown in prison he
[1:18:40] didn't know what the next thing was
[1:18:41] gonna be but he was patient and that he
[1:18:47] knew it was in God's hands and he
[1:18:49] depended on Jehovah you don't hear of
[1:18:54] Joseph crying in despair
[1:19:01] but Joseph helped everyone that he was
[1:19:05] around Joseph must have thought of
[1:19:11] others and not been a self-centered
[1:19:15] individual had he been self-centered
[1:19:17] Potiphar would have never been blessed
[1:19:23] but he wasn't self-centered that's
[1:19:28] something that this generation coming up
[1:19:31] is very so everything is about them
[1:19:41] every situation if they get around you a
[1:19:44] situation you're going through they'll
[1:19:45] somehow turn around to be about them
[1:19:51] not everything's about you
[1:20:00] where Joseph had fainted and he waited
[1:20:05] and then there was a time when God
[1:20:10] raised him up to be at the right hand of
[1:20:12] Pharaoh he was second in command in
[1:20:18] Egypt
[1:20:21] nube and then he couldn't see how the
[1:20:26] dreams were going to be fulfilled but
[1:20:31] then a famine came into the land to try
[1:20:36] the children of Israel and so because of
[1:20:46] Joseph's interpretation of Pharaoh's
[1:20:51] dreams he was able to store up grain for
[1:20:55] these seven years of famine you wonder
[1:21:00] during those seven years of plenty was
[1:21:03] it just plenty in Egypt or was it plenty
[1:21:05] everywhere I imagine it was plentiful
[1:21:14] everywhere because Jacob and his sons
[1:21:19] had no need to go anywhere else they
[1:21:26] must not have been very frugal
[1:21:29] during those years of plenty because
[1:21:33] when the years of famine came they had
[1:21:34] nothing and so the dreams came to pass
[1:21:42] in a way that none of them could have
[1:21:45] ever seen it happen
[1:21:51] was there to actually deliver them from
[1:21:56] their time of need the spoken word is
[1:22:03] the original seed brother branham said
[1:22:04] that's what's a matter today they don't
[1:22:07] want to wait for God's time they want to
[1:22:12] get something else and so the devil's
[1:22:15] got the wisdom right there to give it to
[1:22:17] them just couldn't wait I've got a
[1:22:25] little story here I read some years ago
[1:22:28] and if you'll allow me and bear with me
[1:22:33] it's something even the children could
[1:22:37] understand and I'll read it to you it's
[1:22:41] called the Frog and the toad and the
[1:22:44] flower garden here are some flower seeds
[1:22:51] plant them and soon you will have a
[1:22:53] garden said frog how soon toad acts
[1:22:56] quite soon said frog toad ran home and
[1:23:00] planted the flower seeds as fast as he
[1:23:01] could now see and start growing toad
[1:23:04] said as he walked up and down and up and
[1:23:07] down watching for signs of growth the
[1:23:09] seeds did not grow tongue cut down on
[1:23:12] his knees to get closer to the ground
[1:23:14] and said now seeds start growing the
[1:23:18] seeds did not grow maybe they can't hear
[1:23:21] me very good thought toad cold but his
[1:23:24] mount very close to the ground and
[1:23:26] shouted now seed start growing the seeds
[1:23:29] still did not grow frog come running to
[1:23:33] see what all the noise was about and
[1:23:34] toad explained about his seeds not being
[1:23:36] able to hear him
[1:23:37] problem said that's nothing to do with
[1:23:39] it just leave the seed alone for a few
[1:23:41] days let the Sun Shine on them let the
[1:23:44] rain fall on them and they'll start to
[1:23:46] grow soon enough as the darkness of
[1:23:49] night began to approach toad still could
[1:23:51] not see any signs of growth on the part
[1:23:53] of the seeds they must be afraid of the
[1:23:55] dark he thought I will read them a story
[1:23:58] so he got a candle for light and a book
[1:24:00] to read to the seeds so it's a calm
[1:24:02] there fear
[1:24:03] you read to them as the candle light
[1:24:05] cast around the mouth but still the
[1:24:07] seeds did not grow the next day told
[1:24:10] sang songs to the seeds to make him feel
[1:24:12] happy but the seeds didn't grow the next
[1:24:15] day he read poems to them to encourage
[1:24:16] their cultural awareness but the seeds
[1:24:19] did not grow the next day toad played
[1:24:22] music to make the seeds feel lively but
[1:24:25] still the seeds did not grow by the end
[1:24:28] of the day told was very tired and out
[1:24:30] of ideals of how to make the seeds grow
[1:24:32] he's head down to think about it at a
[1:24:34] last fell asleep sleep from exhaustion
[1:24:37] the Sun rose the next morning and found
[1:24:40] toes still asleep told slip all through
[1:24:42] today and all through the night the next
[1:24:45] morning he was awakened by frog and said
[1:24:47] look toad your seeds have started to
[1:24:48] grow toad looked and saw a little green
[1:24:51] shoots coming out of the ground and says
[1:24:53] it's about time they started to grow
[1:24:55] after all the hard work I've done now I
[1:24:58] have to do it all over again I suppose
[1:25:00] to get them to have flowers sometimes
[1:25:10] that's the way we sing we'll do this and
[1:25:15] we'll do that and we'll do the other and
[1:25:17] we'll do something else and we're trying
[1:25:19] to figure out how to to produce this
[1:25:24] answer to our problem but it's all you
[1:25:32] got to do is wait just as the seeds had
[1:25:39] the germ of life in them that that was
[1:25:42] all that was required to make them grow
[1:25:45] so is the seeds of the word I told you
[1:25:55] it was just a simple little story but
[1:26:02] here's some quotes do along with it when
[1:26:06] you sow a seed you don't dig it up every
[1:26:09] morning to see if it come to pass if you
[1:26:12] do your seed will never come up you got
[1:26:14] to plant it
[1:26:15] commit it to the earth and let
[1:26:17] alone it's up to nature God to water it
[1:26:21] and see that it produces is that true
[1:26:24] that's the way we receive every word of
[1:26:27] God causes the seed we receive it into
[1:26:30] our heart and committed to God and
[1:26:32] forget about it
[1:26:33] God does the rest of it cause he
[1:26:35] promised he would and show us the Father
[1:26:39] he says now when you bury a seed you
[1:26:40] farmers you take and go out there and
[1:26:43] plant your corn you don't go out every
[1:26:45] morning and scratch it up and say let's
[1:26:48] see now is it growing anything happened
[1:26:52] to it no put it back down late the next
[1:26:55] day you say I want to see if it's
[1:26:58] getting along all right scratch it up
[1:27:01] again it'll never grow like that well
[1:27:04] the thing you do with the seed you
[1:27:06] commit it to the ground and cover it up
[1:27:08] and that's all you can do about it it's
[1:27:10] up to God to do the rest of it well
[1:27:13] that's the same way it is with the Word
[1:27:15] of God if you'll take any divine promise
[1:27:17] of God laid in his Bible and put it in
[1:27:19] your heart and water it every day with
[1:27:22] the praises of God that's going to that
[1:27:24] it's going to come to pass it'll grow
[1:27:26] you don't have to quit if you don't quit
[1:27:30] fooling with it you'll just leave it
[1:27:33] alone don't say let me see can I move my
[1:27:37] finger any better today do I feel any
[1:27:39] better is my headache a little better oh
[1:27:41] no it'll never be that just committed to
[1:27:44] God walk away and leave it alone
[1:27:46] that's God's seed it'll grow every time
[1:27:50] you dig it up you delay it and he's
[1:27:56] talking about divine healing he says in
[1:28:01] doubt son of David have mercy on me says
[1:28:04] but we don't always know you know God's
[1:28:07] works in mysterious ways his wonders to
[1:28:09] perform
[1:28:10] now just commit them to God that's all
[1:28:13] you have to do don't put your hand on it
[1:28:15] anymore let God have it if you're going
[1:28:19] to do something about it then God will
[1:28:21] stand back and let you go ahead till you
[1:28:23] get finished
[1:28:27] but when you committed to God and let
[1:28:30] him have it then he will do it you just
[1:28:33] believe him and stand back and don't
[1:28:35] work but believe that's where grace is
[1:28:37] imputed for righteousness if you believe
[1:28:40] that God will I've been there when God
[1:28:47] stand back and say we'll go ahead and do
[1:28:49] what you're gonna do Jerry and then when
[1:28:54] I get to the end of it let's say well it
[1:28:56] didn't work and then where am I at right
[1:29:00] back at the start again
[1:29:05] where am I at right back to where I
[1:29:07] should have been committed it to God in
[1:29:09] the first place God in his people he
[1:29:19] says he can't do it until as long as
[1:29:22] you're holding it now I will see if I'm
[1:29:25] any better see if this will work you
[1:29:28] committed to him and forget about the
[1:29:29] rest of it go testify of things you
[1:29:32] don't even see you believe it it's not
[1:29:35] what you see it's what you believe
[1:29:37] that's how you're saved is by faith
[1:29:39] faith is the substance of things hoped
[1:29:41] for the evidence of things you don't see
[1:29:43] taste feel smell or hear you just
[1:29:47] believe it and act as though it was act
[1:29:52] as though it had already happened the
[1:29:59] word is a seed the seed is in the right
[1:30:01] kind of ground it'll grow you don't dig
[1:30:04] it up every morning to find out whether
[1:30:06] it's grown or not you just plant it
[1:30:07] committed to God leave it there that's
[1:30:09] the way to let it grow just leave it the
[1:30:13] way in the ground and that's where I'm
[1:30:15] it's supposed to be the ground of your
[1:30:18] heart
[1:30:18] faith is watering it hourly saying if
[1:30:21] God said so it's mine that's the way to
[1:30:24] do it
[1:30:27] he asked here how long does a baby cry
[1:30:33] until he gets what he's asked for
[1:30:39] God recommends this for his children God
[1:30:43] recommends this for his believing
[1:30:44] children he did not intellectual
[1:30:47] speeches not some theological teaching
[1:30:50] he wants you to cry out for your needs
[1:30:54] that's right crowd for it you're too
[1:30:56] stiff and starchy you'll never get it if
[1:30:59] you're ready to limber yourself up a
[1:31:02] little and cry God will give it to you
[1:31:04] he likes to hear his children cry cry
[1:31:06] your needs to God God wants it that's
[1:31:09] his provided way cry out that's the way
[1:31:12] the baby cries that's the way he wants
[1:31:16] you to cry cry how long how long does a
[1:31:18] baby cry until he gets satisfied that's
[1:31:22] the way the believing Christians should
[1:31:23] do God's child if you see God made the
[1:31:26] promise don't give up cry until it's
[1:31:29] answered cry until you see God vindicate
[1:31:32] his word when God vindicated it's
[1:31:35] working proofs it's here then you don't
[1:31:37] have to cry numb worn you've got it walk
[1:31:39] away and thanking for it until you do
[1:31:41] that scream out do you get it I like
[1:31:44] that persistent holding on not a
[1:31:47] high-bred plant not one that has to be
[1:31:50] babied petted and packed them around
[1:31:52] Christians are real genuine born
[1:31:55] articles of God they fight for their
[1:31:57] position and they fight til they're
[1:31:59] finished on this earth every move of it
[1:32:02] is a fight
[1:32:05] now this crying is not complaining seen
[1:32:12] folks go through trials or a time of
[1:32:16] testing testing to see if they'll
[1:32:19] believe for their healing and they'll
[1:32:25] call around and complain to everybody
[1:32:30] you ask them you ask them out in the
[1:32:34] parking lot how are you feeling and then
[1:32:35] you immediately wish you hadn't asked
[1:32:38] I like the testimony of the woman who
[1:32:48] said all is well even in death she
[1:32:54] testified all is well why it was
[1:33:00] committed to God she believed that if
[1:33:05] she could get to the prophet of God that
[1:33:08] God was gonna raise her boy back up so
[1:33:12] when she was asked how is it with you
[1:33:15] your husband and your child she said all
[1:33:17] is well it's always that way for the
[1:33:24] believer for the believer all is well
[1:33:29] all the time why because we're in God
[1:33:35] and He is give his angels charge over
[1:33:40] you to watch over you
[1:33:59] here with me to Genesis chapter 17
[1:34:03] wanted to read verses 1 3
[1:34:29] when Abraham was ninety years old and
[1:34:32] nine the Lord appeared to Abram and said
[1:34:35] unto him I am the Almighty God walk
[1:34:39] before me and be thou perfect now listen
[1:34:43] to this and I will make my covenant
[1:34:46] between me and thee who is gonna do it
[1:34:50] God and will multiply the exceedingly
[1:34:55] and Abram fell on his face and God
[1:34:57] talked with him saying as for me behold
[1:35:00] my covenant is with thee and thou shalt
[1:35:03] be a father of many nations neither
[1:35:06] shall thy name anymore be Abram but thy
[1:35:10] name shall be Abraham for a father of
[1:35:13] many nations have I made thee and I will
[1:35:16] make thee exceedingly fruitful was it up
[1:35:20] to Abraham no God says I will make you
[1:35:24] exceedingly fruitful I will make nations
[1:35:28] of thee and Kings shall come out of thee
[1:35:31] I will establish my covenant between me
[1:35:35] and thee and thy seed after thee and
[1:35:38] their generations for an everlasting
[1:35:39] covenant to be God unto them and to thy
[1:35:43] seed after thee and I will give unto
[1:35:48] thee and to thy seed after thee the land
[1:35:51] wherein thou art a stranger all the land
[1:35:53] of canaan for an everlasting possession
[1:35:55] and I will be their God it's not within
[1:36:06] our power anyway but he promised that he
[1:36:13] would take care of us he promised to be
[1:36:18] our Shepherd he's our Savior and he is
[1:36:29] faithful
[1:36:43] Genesis 48 verse three and four
[1:37:00] and Jacob said unto Joseph God Almighty
[1:37:04] appeared unto me that lust in the land
[1:37:06] of Canaan and blessed me and said unto
[1:37:09] me behold i will make thee fruitful and
[1:37:13] multiply thee i will make of the
[1:37:16] multitude of people and will give this
[1:37:20] land to thy seed after thee for an
[1:37:22] everlasting possession so we first read
[1:37:26] where he was speaking to Abraham and he
[1:37:29] was telling Abraham I going to do this
[1:37:33] and then in the fulfillment of that
[1:37:36] promise to the generations after Abraham
[1:37:38] he comes to Jacob and again says in
[1:37:41] rehearses what he had said to Abram
[1:37:44] years before I'm gonna make you fruitful
[1:37:50] I'm gonna multiply you exceedingly God's
[1:37:54] gonna do it who's gonna bring about the
[1:38:03] answer that we need God will now he's
[1:38:10] got many different avenues in which
[1:38:12] he'll bring it sometimes he can bring
[1:38:17] the answer through your pastor but then
[1:38:21] there's times when the answer is not
[1:38:23] going to come to you until the end of
[1:38:26] the time of testing and then you can
[1:38:31] look back and you see all there's what
[1:38:35] it was
[1:38:40] patience
[1:38:48] you imagine the patients that Noah had
[1:38:55] Noah was given the Word of God that he
[1:39:00] was gonna flood the earth
[1:39:02] and he was given instructions on how to
[1:39:04] build the ark detailed instruction and
[1:39:14] you know I think if it would have been
[1:39:20] maybe
[1:39:21] you or I in Noah's place Noah being
[1:39:25] human just like we are Noah had no idea
[1:39:32] that it was going to be a hundred and
[1:39:34] twenty years before it happened but Noah
[1:39:40] set forth to work on the ark like it was
[1:39:45] gonna happen tomorrow and he had
[1:39:51] patience because brother branham said he
[1:39:54] was mocked by the people brother branham
[1:39:58] gives an example of he says like mr.
[1:40:00] skeptic and mr. critic and they would
[1:40:06] come by and they would laugh at him
[1:40:08] because of what he was doing the work
[1:40:13] that he was doing and what he said was
[1:40:16] going to happen had never ever happened
[1:40:18] before in the beginning the earth was
[1:40:23] watered from a mist that rose up from
[1:40:24] the ground but now he said water is
[1:40:29] gonna fall from the sky and it's gonna
[1:40:36] rain so much that it's gonna flood the
[1:40:39] whole word and the only ones is gonna be
[1:40:42] saved as those that get in this art with
[1:40:44] me now God knowing the beginning from
[1:40:56] the end made room for eight people
[1:41:03] [Applause]
[1:41:04] but Noah still had to preach that to the
[1:41:09] people for a hundred and twenty years
[1:41:16] patient and on year 90 he believed it
[1:41:23] just as much as he did on day one not
[1:41:32] knowing that it was still yet going to
[1:41:36] be thirty more years before it happened
[1:41:47] how long 120-year as it was in the days
[1:42:03] of Noah so shall it also be in the days
[1:42:05] of the son of man I wonder when will be
[1:42:17] that time to where we're preaching the
[1:42:19] souls are in prison now you realize last
[1:42:28] one comes in then there's going to be a
[1:42:31] time when that part of the third pool is
[1:42:36] fulfilled
[1:42:37] I believe that in many instances there
[1:42:46] are people who hear and know about this
[1:42:50] truth and they've already rejected it
[1:42:55] they're in prison now they're waiting
[1:43:01] for the time of judgment that's all
[1:43:03] they're waiting for that's how close we
[1:43:08] are we've heard preaching that there's
[1:43:12] going to be a rapture and time has went
[1:43:15] on
[1:43:24] we don't know if there was anybody else
[1:43:28] that might have at first thought maybe
[1:43:32] he's right maybe snow was right maybe
[1:43:36] there's something to that but in the
[1:43:40] time of the delay they said no no he's
[1:43:47] not right there's nothing to it we've
[1:43:53] heard about a rapture coming for years
[1:43:56] we've believed I can remember as a
[1:43:59] little boy I never thought I would reach
[1:44:03] adulthood
[1:44:04] I thought the rapture was gonna take
[1:44:09] place already I can remember the time
[1:44:23] the world was where the United States
[1:44:28] rather was celebrating their 200 years
[1:44:34] 1970s thing and I can remember thinking
[1:44:39] we only got one more year and yet time
[1:44:46] went on and we're in the time of the
[1:44:51] delay right now the Bible said they
[1:44:56] would say the LORD hath delayed his
[1:44:58] coming and they would stray from the
[1:45:06] truth
[1:45:13] we were closer and what we've got to do
[1:45:19] is patiently endure because the end is
[1:45:25] near I don't know how they could go on
[1:45:32] much longer few days ago I was talking
[1:45:40] to one of my uncle's and he said I can't
[1:45:45] see it going on another 25 years here
[1:46:01] but we've got it in doer
[1:46:03] I don't know how long it's gonna be
[1:46:09] but in the same token we don't know how
[1:46:13] many more days we have as individual
[1:46:21] when is our time up
[1:46:24] when is it our time to go
[1:46:32] so endure be patient
[1:46:46] death we grieve we're grieving for our
[1:46:49] loss we're grieving for the times that
[1:46:53] we know that we're going to miss them
[1:46:57] knowing that we won't be able to sit
[1:47:01] down maybe and drink another cup of
[1:47:03] coffee with them we rise up they're not
[1:47:06] going to be there and we grieve but
[1:47:10] they're not grieving they have endured
[1:47:17] until their time and they are rewarded
[1:47:26] actually by being taken they're ready
[1:47:35] whenever I think of things like that I
[1:47:38] think of brother Branham and his first
[1:47:39] wife hope and I think of her having two
[1:47:45] young babies brother Ram talks about
[1:47:52] trying to warm up Billy Paul's bottle
[1:47:55] with his body
[1:47:56] yeah so Billy Paul was still young
[1:47:59] enough he was a baby and another baby
[1:48:03] sharing road and a young husband they
[1:48:09] were just a young married couple and yet
[1:48:13] she says to him why did you call me back
[1:48:23] something happened a few moments before
[1:48:30] that her mind may have been on those two
[1:48:33] children her mind may have been on her
[1:48:37] leaving her husband her mind me have
[1:48:39] been on those things but then after she
[1:48:42] catches a glimpse of that other side she
[1:48:45] says why did you call me back to me that
[1:48:51] says something about where we're going
[1:48:55] [Applause]
[1:48:59] and it says something about where our
[1:49:02] loved ones are I wouldn't want to call
[1:49:14] my dad back he suffered a lot the last
[1:49:21] few years I wouldn't want to call him
[1:49:24] back to that but through all his
[1:49:35] suffering he endured he was patient
[1:49:45] never complaining but patient we have
[1:49:54] need of patience the bottle that I
[1:49:58] encourage you with this message that was
[1:50:03] on my heart this morning let patience
[1:50:07] have it's perfect way in you tribulation
[1:50:15] worketh patience the Bible said amen I'm
[1:50:22] gonna close before I get into the next
[1:50:24] message
[1:50:38] I'll read this to you
[1:50:42] this is the message of getting in the
[1:50:44] spirit
[1:50:49] what we need today is back to the fruit
[1:50:53] of the Spirit love joy peace faith
[1:50:56] long-suffering God can send a gift among
[1:50:59] them and they will call it telepathy
[1:51:01] they'll call it the devil they'll call
[1:51:04] it something else if one church is
[1:51:07] sponsoring it the other one will pick it
[1:51:08] up it's all right now because this one
[1:51:11] had something to do with it it's no good
[1:51:13] oh my what a pitiful condition yes sir
[1:51:17] we realize that the fruit of faith the
[1:51:20] fruit of love joy peace longsuffering
[1:51:22] goodness meekness gentleness patience
[1:51:27] patience why they can't bear seven days
[1:51:32] with one another hardly seven hours
[1:51:34] sometimes not even seven minutes they'll
[1:51:38] jump up and round the church if you say
[1:51:40] something that's not exactly what their
[1:51:42] little pet theory is they got to get up
[1:51:46] and run out of the church over it oh
[1:51:47] they can't sit still in wait a minute
[1:51:50] they got to get out of there
[1:51:54] all that ain't what pastor so-and-so
[1:51:56] says hallelujah I don't have to listen
[1:51:59] to that no such stuff oh you miserable
[1:52:06] there you are go ahead patience
[1:52:23] now in closing I've got one thing that I
[1:52:29] can tell you that if you want to have a
[1:52:37] feeling of I can't hardly wait for
[1:52:40] something to happen let it be this you
[1:52:46] got tapes on what we believe you've got
[1:52:49] tapes on discipline in the church and
[1:52:52] how we behave ourselves in Church of God
[1:52:54] how we got to come in here together and
[1:52:56] sit in heavenly places don't stay home
[1:52:59] if God is in your heart you can't hardly
[1:53:02] wait for them doors to open out yonder
[1:53:05] to get in here to fellowship with your
[1:53:08] brothers and sisters if you don't feel
[1:53:12] that way I tell you it's time you got
[1:53:14] the brain because we're in the last days
[1:53:19] where the Bible exhorted us much more as
[1:53:22] we see the Day approaching
[1:53:24] to love one another with Christian love
[1:53:26] and divine love to assemble ourselves
[1:53:28] together in heavenly places and Christ
[1:53:30] Jesus and love one another this will all
[1:53:33] men know you're my disciples when you
[1:53:35] have love one for another
[1:53:37] that's right stay right together reminds
[1:53:45] me of brother Bentham saying the angel
[1:53:52] said to him when he was beyond the
[1:53:53] curtain of time says only perfect love
[1:53:57] and enter here something all these
[1:54:05] things is fruits of the spirit they all
[1:54:07] go hand in hand
[1:54:12] long suffering something we need to be
[1:54:16] with one another we're human we're still
[1:54:22] in this flesh let me make mistakes and
[1:54:29] we're not perfect and sometimes we say
[1:54:36] things and we didn't mean it to come out
[1:54:38] the way it came out sometimes we say
[1:54:44] things at the wrong times but be
[1:54:50] long-suffering love one another be
[1:54:54] patient with one another those dogs
[1:55:00] working on us all amen god bless you
[1:55:07] [Applause]
[1:55:44] what a word of encouragement
[1:55:50] you know I just take it how that God
[1:55:55] comes down through his word and he gives
[1:55:57] it's how God gives leadership you know
[1:56:03] the precious reality in this hour that
[1:56:05] we live in you think of the message
[1:56:07] where the Prophet speaks leadership and
[1:56:11] right before that he speaks on come
[1:56:14] follow down me it's still the message of
[1:56:16] leadership and brother Branham is
[1:56:21] cautioning even in that message come
[1:56:23] follow thou me he cautions even the
[1:56:25] young people he says I don't want this
[1:56:28] message to be intellectual I believe
[1:56:34] that's caution to all of our hearts and
[1:56:37] I believe that real leadership that real
[1:56:40] leadership becomes by this presence of
[1:56:43] the Lord coming down through his word
[1:56:45] because when you look in many times
[1:56:48] through the scriptures it says as it the
[1:56:51] promise and Joel - that he pour out his
[1:56:54] spirit upon all flesh young men shall
[1:56:57] dream dreams or prophesy they will
[1:57:00] mentioning dreams all of those things in
[1:57:03] there it the Spirit of God falling
[1:57:05] throughout this earth but yet God being
[1:57:10] mindful as the Lord took brother Jerry
[1:57:13] and God Reed made the promise known to
[1:57:17] Abraham he rehearsed it to Jacob he
[1:57:23] rehearsed it on down through and that
[1:57:26] saying God has been generation age after
[1:57:31] age rehearsing the promise that he made
[1:57:37] when the Holy Spirit comes down through
[1:57:39] the word it's not just a feeling it's
[1:57:43] not just something to wear that was a
[1:57:46] mine just-just-just forbidden and then
[1:57:49] the presence of God called my the Holy
[1:57:52] Spirit but it gives leadership and you
[1:57:55] say well how do you know that it gives
[1:57:56] leadership because we hear his voice
[1:57:59] it's not just something we feel we hear
[1:58:03] his voice and then we see as we yield to
[1:58:07] that and Submission we see that
[1:58:09] leadership that word takes preeminence
[1:58:13] in our lives
[1:58:14] to guide us from where our feelings
[1:58:17] might be thoughts might be even to guide
[1:58:22] you maybe even this morning from some
[1:58:23] that are here and where your soul might
[1:58:25] be but yet the voice of God speaks to
[1:58:28] bring things and bring you bring me
[1:58:32] where we need to be what do I have to do
[1:58:36] do the same thing that he has done once
[1:58:39] again this morning he has submitted
[1:58:41] himself to you the Lord of glory has
[1:58:46] come and submitted himself to your needs
[1:58:49] and my needs
[1:58:52] when God makes a promise in his word
[1:58:54] Ephesians 5 submitting yourselves to one
[1:58:57] another in the fear of God he gives his
[1:59:00] word is who he is
[1:59:02] so he came here this morning to submit
[1:59:07] himself to minister to our needs so what
[1:59:10] does that do to us it draws from us to
[1:59:13] say yes Lord be it unto me Lord God Lord
[1:59:18] if there's any cloud of doubt Lord God
[1:59:20] you are light the Rays or God of your
[1:59:24] presence as Moses could say the Lord
[1:59:28] bless thee the Lord keep thee the Lord
[1:59:31] make his face to shine upon thee that's
[1:59:35] our promise that's our promise if there
[1:59:40] be anything Lord at all that's out of
[1:59:42] line Lord Jesus forgive me Lord let it
[1:59:47] be brought back in line if there's
[1:59:48] anything that's hindering that patients
[1:59:52] that steadfastness to look at things the
[1:59:54] way that I ought to look at it
[1:59:56] Lord Jesus cleanse me Lord God allow the
[2:00:01] bathing of the word of the Holy Spirit
[2:00:03] to just move and just and do what he
[2:00:06] alone is able to do and receive it
[2:00:11] because that words already come the
[2:00:12] words already been washing take your
[2:00:15] opportunity this is your labor this is
[2:00:18] your Lutron this is your place that God
[2:00:21] has provided that you can bathe in this
[2:00:24] word this morning and bathe by the way
[2:00:28] by the way all trepidations bathe away
[2:00:31] fear bathe away doubt they the way
[2:00:34] anything that would hinder because the
[2:00:39] word Christ Himself standing in the
[2:00:41] midst of it is our absolute
[2:00:43] a minute he though the vision Terry it
[2:00:50] shall surely come to pass
[2:00:54] Amen God is faithful and you know I I
[2:00:59] couldn't help but think brother Jerry
[2:01:01] I've really enjoyed that story that toad
[2:01:03] in the Frog because what I thought of is
[2:01:06] this
[2:01:09] there's some times that we might not see
[2:01:11] results in the manner and in the time
[2:01:15] that we want to see him and when it
[2:01:18] doesn't happen in that way then Satan
[2:01:21] will come and try to try to poke doubt
[2:01:23] at you as to there's something wrong
[2:01:26] with you
[2:01:28] because he knows he's not going to be
[2:01:32] able to poke to you that there's
[2:01:34] something wrong with this truth but I
[2:01:38] tried to say there's something wrong
[2:01:39] with you so then what is what is this
[2:01:43] what is this whole objective to get you
[2:01:45] looking at you oh that's dangerous it's
[2:01:49] dangerous that's what happened with
[2:01:52] Bildad in life as and I don't remember
[2:01:54] the other fellas name that came to Joe
[2:01:55] or the gene they got the talking to him
[2:01:58] and all of a sudden they got Joe away
[2:02:01] from talking about his sacrifice Jobe
[2:02:05] started looking at himself trying to
[2:02:07] justify himself but I'm so glad that
[2:02:10] there was Ellie who became Ella who said
[2:02:16] I'll let all the rest of him speak
[2:02:18] because he said I thought those were
[2:02:20] ancient would have words of wisdom I let
[2:02:23] him speak
[2:02:24] God has led or everything speak but a
[2:02:27] lion came to roar
[2:02:29] and Ella who said I am clay as thou art
[2:02:33] clay I am in thy stead in the stead of
[2:02:37] God for thee amen
[2:02:40] he came to speak and prepare Joe for God
[2:02:45] to come down and speak to him it was
[2:02:47] gone all along it was God in Ella who
[2:02:50] God has prepared it's God moving it's
[2:02:55] God directing us sometimes and I think
[2:02:58] of that that story but Raven stuffed my
[2:03:01] hair the toad was wasn't singing over it
[2:03:03] and everything he was doing I've been
[2:03:09] told I've been told
[2:03:15] but when you look at it this is what I
[2:03:18] was was so inspired to my heart is just
[2:03:23] remain and just let the word by the
[2:03:27] Spirit of God have it's perfect work
[2:03:30] just keep laying under the word letting
[2:03:33] the word just move in your hearts move
[2:03:36] in our lives and watch God bring forth
[2:03:41] what he alone is able to do
[2:03:49] it's not our strength is history I'll
[2:03:52] tell you sister faith that we have to
[2:03:55] stand for this moment it's not something
[2:03:57] that we have given ourselves but it's
[2:04:00] God who has created and brought the
[2:04:04] faith that we need for this moment
[2:04:07] it's all sovereignly jehovah-jireh
[2:04:13] you're loving this morning
[2:04:16] just a greater dedication just let God
[2:04:21] fulfill his promise let it draw you when
[2:04:25] God has made a promise to your heart

[2:04:30] that promise

[2:04:35] Holy Spirit let him fulfill that promise

[2:06:53] things didn't either happen according to
[2:06:55] our way or our time but your grace just
[2:07:00] as it was to John with John speaking the
[2:07:03] word that was true but yet he had his
[2:07:06] thinking of how would come about and
[2:07:09] your prophets that he became offended
[2:07:13] but then you sent the word to say go

[2:07:23] these things that take place oh my lord

[2:07:30] become focused upon he is a cloud of his
[2:07:33] Eagle Eye you knew what was needed Lord

[2:11:49] [Music]
[2:11:51] to stop was over
[2:11:54] [Music]
[2:11:56] it's not because I'm good
[2:11:59] not because of grace not because I'm
[2:12:03] strong I just had
[2:12:09] ask me how it is but I'm still standing
[2:12:17] you wonder have made the stone
[2:12:26] I can boast of any special powers
[2:12:33] there's no secrets I just held on and
[2:12:41] the head gym store was sold
[2:12:48] I don't play to be a hero don't have all
[2:12:56] the answers

[2:13:06] now because I'm good happy cause and
[2:13:10] great now because I'm strong
[2:13:14] just
[2:13:16] [Music]
[2:13:24] I can tell the things finally happened
[2:13:31] I've got blessings now I can call my
[2:13:40] many times I wondered if I would make it
[2:13:48] slower you're in I just can't
[2:13:55] and
[2:13:59] [Music]
[2:14:15] the small
[2:14:18] [Music]
[2:14:22] not because
[2:14:24] [Music]
[2:14:37] that's beautiful isn't it
[2:14:39] I bet you thankful for God's grace
[2:14:46] hallelujah amen
[2:14:48] I thought about what brother Jerry what
[2:14:52] he mentioned here and with brother with
[2:14:56] his lot in Noah's life
[2:15:21] try to try to hinder and try to come in
[2:15:26] priorities things but always remember
[2:15:31] this life it's fleeting everything that
[2:15:38] you can have and whatever in this life
[2:15:40] nothing is worth the Lord not being
[2:15:45] first and I'll mean that with all my
[2:15:49] heart nothing is worth it if there's an
[2:15:53] ambition if there's any goal if there's
[2:15:56] any objective let it be one thing and
[2:15:58] that is the coming of the Lord live for
[2:16:05] it live for him each and every day and
[2:16:08] every moment so beside me I want this
[2:16:12] thing it's not worth it's not worth it
[2:16:17] if it comes between you and dedicating
[2:16:21] your life to the Lord fully but both
[2:16:25] Simon finally worked like for Sunday's I
[2:16:27] can have it you're out of the will of
[2:16:29] God
[2:16:30] that's thus saith the Lord God will
[2:16:33] never cause you to compromise his word
[2:16:37] never it's us sometimes it needs to come
[2:16:41] back to the place to say Lord I'm I want
[2:16:44] this but this is not according to what
[2:16:48] you have for me
[2:16:51] let him be first that's a principle he's
[2:16:56] first in all things and he said all
[2:16:58] these other things will be added unto
[2:17:01] you
[2:17:02] sometimes you seem like you got a lot on
[2:17:04] your plate he said I got this on my
[2:17:06] plate I got this on my plate I got this
[2:17:08] on my plate but remember if you
[2:17:10] sacrifice anywhere don't sacrifice on
[2:17:14] coming to the house of God you sacrifice
[2:17:18] meals sacrifice time of pleasure
[2:17:20] sacrifice every other thing but don't
[2:17:22] sacrifice come into the house of God
[2:17:25] because if God led you to that job and
[2:17:28] if God has opened a certain door for you
[2:17:31] you owe him everything that you are that
[2:17:36] he is first in everything because when
[2:17:39] you start taking back and taken away
[2:17:41] from it then what you're telling the
[2:17:42] Lord is is Lord I got this I got this
[2:17:47] but see you cannot overcome that
[2:17:50] principle seek you first God is faithful
[2:17:57] one thing for sure we know that we're
[2:18:00] not going we don't have an easy journey
[2:18:01] there's nothing easy nothing comes easy
[2:18:04] we fight for everything everything you
[2:18:07] fight for I would rather have the Lord
[2:18:11] standing with me than me trying to fight
[2:18:16] it on my own me man I just love him this
[2:18:23] morning amen we're gonna let you be
[2:18:27] dismissed in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:18:28] and let's sing that song as we are being
[2:18:33] dismissed in the presence of Jehovah
[2:18:39] hallelujah in the presence of Jehovah
