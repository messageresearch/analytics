our Lord amen amen how many has a need you like to oh knowbody lifted here praise the Lord amen God bless you brother Chris so appreciate brother Dave chest Jr don't we we certainly do amen and what a fitting song to open up with I guess I got two testimonies because uh I don't know if you've seen the flooding and such down in Tennessee but my cousin that goes down to brother Donnie Reagan's uh was one of the uh members that was rescued on top of the hospital he said that the water was up at like 75 ft at some places and uh by the time he got rescued it was about 2T from the top of the roof of the hospital and he had airlifted by a helicopter so um I'm just thankful for that and uh afterwards uh the CEO or or whatever the hospital that uh is a uh just open atheist um had uh told my told my cousins that to gather all the hospital staff and uh to say a prayer you know and said he just felt the presence of the Lord come down uh just in that that little area there and so I I believe there's good things going to happen out of that too and so I I'll try to be uh quick here but uh just wanted to give you a little update on Dad um he's he's actually being transferred to to rehab he spent the last uh three days in the three nights in the hospital um with recovery and such he came home for for one night and um it it was very apparent that that was not going to work out I mean real quick so uh the next morning um I got uh on the phone and was was trying to make calls and such to to try to get him back into rehab and um I'll just be honest with you that the first answer was a direct no this this can't happen you you you know when you left the hospital the case was closed and with Medicare and such once it's a closed case it's it's done you know um and then at some point um after a few calls we we they called back and said you need to take your dad to the emergency room and we'll reopen the case um he's got to spend three nights in the hospital and then go to a rehab facility from there so we uh loaded him up and and ironically the the physical therapist that was um scheduled to come that day he came and helped me get Dad back out of the house because I didn't know how I was going to get him out by myself so he was able to to get him out of the house so again the Lord just opening the the door to get him back into the hospital um and then so we get to the hospital and they're running all the checks and stuff and uh kind of a long story we were there for hours uh four or five hours and and then they came back in and said well everything's checking out good so we're going to send you back home and I'm like um that's that's not why we're here you know in kind of appealed again um you know and I told him you know that's that's why we're here CU everything is checking out well I know he's he's not injured in any way but you know he's still having a lot of trouble and he said well I can't make any promises but I'll go and I'll ask again you so he goes back um to the the director uh and about and it was another couple hours uh it was about 9:00 at night at this point uh they came back and said we're going to met him and take him up to a room and you know everything is is fine so um I'd just like to read a scripture that uh boy I've just I've just fell in love with this scripture um Isaiah 42 16 it says and I will bring the Blind by a way that they knew not I will lead them in paths that they have not known I will make Darkness light before them and crooked things straight these things will I do unto them and not forsake them I can't explain it my brothers and sisters but it wasn't just a director of uh the hospital and such that was making these decisions I could feel the prayers of the Saints and how it was your prayers that were interceding on on on my dad's behalf and how even when you know the answer was no I know your prayers were interceding and that answer got turned around and became a yes so I just wanted to say thank you from from my heart um I know it wasn't my prayers because I didn't have the energy I I was exhausted and and doing all that I can but uh I I could feel the prayers of the Saints just move in and and intercede so just wanted to say thank you and then through all this um I can tell you I I was actually really challenged by the Holy Spirit uh you know uh just started remembering the first works and my first love and how God was you know when when he first got a hold of my life uh he's just always the center of everything in every decision and every you know just everything you know God was always a center Center of of everything I did and every all the decisions I made and just some somehow there would be one compromise after another you know and then one decision would lead to another one and next thing you know you're just you're just falling away from that first love and that fervency and such and just feeling the prayers of the Saints and stuff it just really challenged me to get back to to my first love and H just that clearcut focus on God because I've come to realize the the way is straight and narrow but it is straight and it's our own self-will that pulls us off of the straight and narrow and the path becomes crooked but like the the scripture here says he God makes the crooked things straight and I believe through this experience that has also happened in my life where I didn't even realize how far I straight still love him still you know not uh like I'd lost my love but I had just lost the the ferency and and I was challenged by that just feeling the the prayer to the to the Saints and how that came about and how that used to be me you know I would always be quick to go to prayer whenever I I heard a need and such and ironically somehow labeled it as spiritual maturity that I didn't you know I was mature enough where I could kind of decide and choose which things were important which things I needed to pray about and and so I I let down the bars and and I would say well there was sheep out in the pasture so there was some good things that were happening but totally ignoring the goat that got in because I had let down the bar so it just really spent a time in prayer and and just asking the Lord to to take me back to that to that first love and just that fervency so I just wanted to make that confession to the Saints I'm sorry I um I just uh was really challenged and it was the Lord doing it wasn't me so wanted to say thank you for your prayers and I sure appreciate each and every one of you and the and the Saints here uh the body of Believers we have both young and old younger and Veterans uh I like brothers and sisters just how we pull together and and it's just my brother Samuel talked about you know the cast uh and and I could feel Satan wanting to uh uh make a break of Dad's situation but there was the cast of prayers that was around the Brokenness that was holding everything together it wouldn't let Satan take him above Beyond a certain bounds so there's also another cast of of characters in in in like a play we know we're in a great drama and I've just been praying to the Lord to take my place my rightful place back again in the cast of this this drama and to become uh back to the part of of this this body that that he needs me to be [Music] so I believe uh I believe that's uh that was a burden on my heart this morning so Dad's doing well appreciate you all I appreciate a pastor that I can have confidence in and just preaches the the pure word and and it's um most of all I appreciate the heavenly father the The Good the great shepher when we're when we're blind and we don't know what steps in front of us says right here in his word he'll lead us in the past He he'll make the light in front of us and like myself when when we get off and we make the way crooked he'll make the crooked things straight he'll do those things he won't forsake us we might be straying away a little but he knows how to get us back so thank you once again let's just go before him in prayer dear heavenly father we just Lord thank you Lord for being Lord such a wonderful a wonderful savior Lord wonderful Shepherd Lord the one we can lean on and depend on and you you're there for us Lord even when we're not there for you Lord you don't forsake us Lord Lord just kind of pour my heart out to the people Lord I just pray once again Lord just to get to that place Lord to get back lord to your feet Lord get back to the feet of Jesus Lord and just let my life Lord wash your feet Lord It's My Prayer just want to pray for these prayer requests Lord my mind's tired I can't remember them all Lord but I just pray Lord your blessings Lord on each and everyone I do remember Lord Brother Bobby Carper Lord and the just all the suffering things he's gone through Lord and we just pray Lord for you to move on the scene Lord and on his behalf Lord and Lord for each and every one Lord I just pray Lord for guidance and Direction Lord and just Lord that you would step in each and every situation Lord and become more real lord to to the individuals involved and Lord they would just draw closer to you Lord through each trial Lord through each test Lord and just draw us Lord closer to you to where lord it's just not something we go through but it's something that changes our lives and changes our Outlook and changes Lord

presence and and so thankful for his mercy and um thankful for all that he has brought us through am God is faithful isn't he amen he is is certainly that we have that testimony Amen in our hearts that God is indeed faithful and um I know the different requests I heard the requests that were being mentioned and um I know that uh different ones uh down there in from the storm that has come through um I know that they were really dealing with it in the eastern part of Tennessee and in the western part of North Carolina had a um text from Brother Barry there yesterday evening and uh there's places where the roads are just washed out and so um and then even um as Benjamin was letting me know that uh even there today like at brother Donnie's you know there's going to be with their service they're having a dinner afterwards and then also allowing people to use the facilities in order to take showers and things uh it's just been it's it's been quite a bit and so we just want to remember them in prayer and I I know you have been but I also remember this in prayer because there's a storm that's forming in the same pattern and so we want to just pray not only that God cause that to recede as far as the water levels that are there God would just continue to watch over his children but also that the Lord would just you know turn that storm I I I know where as as I was talking to him earlier this morning I said Lord I know we're we're in a stage of drought and there's a lot worse places even in Ohio that's worse than what we were our here um and yet even in those areas and they just I was a few years ago I don't remember the name of these hurricanes because they name every one of them but probably you'll remember it that when we we went to prayer because it was going to come on landfall in in Florida and it was such a high category I can't remember what the highest number is but but I know that not only were we as an assembly praying but I know there were many others around the world it was on the thread that I was on and God lessened that category from being such a devastating storm I tell you he's still in control of all things and so we just want to remember them in prayer that God would just just be merciful there in that in that situation amen so could we just maybe stand and we let's just offer a word of prayer and then ask God's bless blessing upon the word as we prepare to look into the word and amen how many are looking forward to the word amen amen I I'm looking forward to what what he has to say Amen I'm in his hands we're in his hands we've come here to hear from God Amen let's just let's just agree together and let's just approach the throne of God heavenly father there is so many things Lord to thank you for we lord if you you never did one more thing for us when you Lord made known by revelation of what you did on Calvary for us Lord and the effect Upon Our Life of that Revelation that lord it's had nothing to do with any of our righteousness or our goodness nothing that we could ever do or become on our own but rather to accept accept what you've done for us the way that's been made Lord that we lord might become partakers of that same divine nature oh I'm so thankful for that Lord Lord I I know there's been many needs in my life needs Lord in the lives of your children and even those that we are taking before your throne right now and father we just ask that you would continue to move Lord for every unspoken prayer request the request that Lord's upon the hearts of your children may you Lord I pray for the brothers and sisters Lord all the those that Lord that are throughout Lord that area in the South Lord that's just been affected oh God it it just Lord to think of it as I just Lord looking at some reports on little videos on YouTube last night and just looking at drone food footage and things like that and how that God that even some of the commentators and things are saying it's just it's the worst that it's ever been there's nothing like this that's on record Lord we're reminded Hallelujah there's a storm that's coming Lord not a storm in the natural but there's a storm that's on the horizon but you've made a preparation for us Lord we didn't find you you found us yes amen thank you Lord you led us brought us to yourself and you are our place of safety Lord amen oh God May every heart every life Lord right here this morning may there not be one Lord that would be found outside of that safety zone Lord God may it just be a just a a real prayer that entered into the heart is oh God let me be found in you Lord and Lord for this storm that's forming there Lord in the ocean right now and wanting to take take that same path father we're asking for your mercy hallu Lord we're asking for your mercy we're asking for Mercy Lord we've seen Lord how that God that you have taken storms hurricanes that's been such Lord a high category and you have reduced it Lord you see Lord every need and we just ask that God that you would just minister to your children Lord just move for that storm Lord I pray Lord for every other request we commit it to you our brother Bobby Lord you see Lord the battle ongoing in his body and just ask God for a complete deliverance and healing Lord of our brother Lord I'm not only asking for this moment but I'm asking for a complete healing [Music] Lord grant it Lord may you just have your way now Lord in this service give us the grace one more time together to step aside that you might have the right away Lord come speak to our hearts for we need to hear from you father help us Lord to get out of the way in the name of Jesus Christ thank amen amen amen amen amen God bless you as you turning in your Bibles to Hebrews chapter 11 I want to read some scripture there Hebrews 11 and verse s will begin there and I want to just say um I just want to say thank you in your sacrifice for your giving and continual giving and we're able to walk in on a nice parking lot and we thank the Lord for that amen and you know what when we're going in Rapture they can have it but in the meantime that's right while we're here I'm going to walk on it and every time I walk on it I'm going to be thankful say Thank You Lord For The Miracle I'm walking on Amen thank you Lord for being our provider I want to say also thank you to brother Richie he I I was in and out of the office over the past three days or three three weeks while all that was going on and the brothers the trustee Brothers had met I think it was back in August and we the changes that was made in order to have that come about and you know how it is you get ready to do anything and you always know there's going to be uh some obstacles you get down there and here we're a week away and you find out from the village they say oh no you you you have to put the apron in and you have to go back so many feet so that just kind of changed everything and I got the looking and I said well God's made a way let's just let's finish this thing out so we are just so thankful to the Lord you know God know God knows what we have need of and he knows just how to supply when we have need of it because we thought sure as the world when we stood out there next April or May that's when we'll be doing the driveway that's what we thought but God had an even an even greater miracle in mind and uh I tell you brother brother Richie has labored uh very much over here and with the construction of all that with the driveway and all that and I know it's been a lot of time that he's taken away from me his job and I want to say thank you brother Richie not and U brother Joey he's kind of been and seeming like in his element I know he's not here just keep him in prayer this morning but he's the one been working moving all these things around and um I tell you I don't think I I looked closely to make sure he didn't have a bow on that Bobcat when he was driving it but uh you know know he's I really appreciate that and um so also I think we're probably self-explanatory the fire pit we won't be able to have that this evening um you know the rain and and it's incredible because uh you know brother Shane had text me yesterday morning honest the goodness I don't know why I didn't get that text um when we were conferring about it or at least that's what he was sending me something and uh but you know I look at the weather forecast and I one time before dinner last night it says only 177% I was like wow man this is incredible the the rain's already come through it then late last night I get to look let me go back over 95% chance wow it's like politicians are politicians controlling the flip-flopping from one to the other I just wonder what's going on but uh anyhow uh we're the Lord I know the Lord will make a way for us to have that uh I thought if nothing else it'd just be good to come set on the parking lot yes sir but uh anyhow uh we we won't do that but Lord willing next weekend or next Sunday we'll have communion and foot washing on Sunday service there so we'll be getting that out to you uh let's read in the word of God and I apologize for keeping you standing so long uh in verse 7 by faith Noah being warned of God of things not not seen as yet moved with fear prepared an ark to the saving of his house by the which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith and by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went and by faith he sojourned in the land Land Of Promise as in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which hath foundations whose Builder and maker is God I I don't know if you ever caught this but look at verse 11 it doesn't say by faith but it says through faith also Sarah herself see Abraham it was Abraham's faith that produced the miracle and Sarah's life see it's not our faith you say is that scriptural well yeah Paul said the life that I live I now live by the faith of the Son of God who gave himself for me through faith also Sarah herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised therefore spring there even one even of one in him as good as dead so many as the stars of the sky sky in multitude and as the sand which is by the seashore innumerable these all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them AAR off and were persuaded of them and embraced them and confess that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth for they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country and truly if they had been mindful of that country from when they came out they might have had an opportunity to have returned but now they desire a better country that is in Heavenly wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God for he hath prepared for them a city amen may God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated and um I'd like to go ahead Brianna you can go and switch that over for me I'd like to just pick up here this morning and resume on this thought of between here and there and you know when we read here in the scriptures as we're reading in Hebrews 11 sometimes it doesn't there's not included I mean you could you could see why the Bible would have to we wouldn't be able to pack it around if it included all of the battles that took place once God revealed and made his will known to an individual it's always there's there's always every time when God speaks then a battle begins to set in remember the prophet would tell us there in the seals of how that every time that when a seal was opened that he said a trumpet was sounded and as soon as that trumpet sounded then war was declared and so every every time when God would would give his word and call his people back to the true atonement away away from the ideas of man as in every age there was always a battle that that follows the word being revealed and that's what we really want to deal with here today in this part of the journey which is not something all together new to us but it's things that God will would speak to us to make it very plain and helpful in our lives because sometimes there's things that we that can be ever so simple but we can we can Wonder and we can look at things and wonder perhaps why I don't see the word coming to pass in my life the way that I believe it should be and notice God's desire he's the one that brings the word to pass that's absolutely the truth we can do nothing without him but everything that God does does is God comes just like in a service like here this morning where we have gathered out from our homes and come together and God comes to speak to our hearts directly by his voice and minister to our lives in such a very personal way and I want you to think of even as we open this here in the scriptures of Noah and this is you know something to me we we've I've been there a few years ago this is this is down in Kentucky but you know it's a uh the think of this Arc to me it was very it's always been incredible to think of it but then as you stand there and you look at it and you are going through that and just to think of how all of this is done and you know this is one of the things I I watched it was a documentary years and years ago I think probably 20 some years ago almost 30 years ago of how that even the naval uh testing that that when they construct their ships they use the same dimensional uh are the same um I do I want to say it proportions that God gave within this pattern because they when they have have have put those proportions into their testing tanks it is deemed Unsinkable and so they have use that for every aircraft carrier for all of these things these same proportions and I I'll just say it like this it's just it's just one testimony if you're going to go to war go with the word because the word is Unsinkable the word is undefeatable that's right is that right so when we think of this with Noah and Noah prior to even entering the ark I mean you know brother Brandon tells us that Noah wasn't even an architect he was a farmer it would you know you would you would think that you know God perhaps you got the wrong address you meant this guy over here but God didn't mean it for anybody else but for Noah brother Bram described Noah as just a simple righteous man before this Revelation came to him brother Braham said he was just a simple man that would gather his family together they would pray they would have devotions and there was a burden upon his heart with seeing the condition of the world at that hour with with with sin in the world and he said it was God who moved and was moving Noah in that place to where Noah would actually receive a divine revelation from God now I want you to think of this it would have to be a revelation remember as we looked at it last week that faith is a revelation faith is sovereignly given you and I cannot work ourselves up into I'm going to get Faith or I'm going to get Faith No that faith is sovereignly given but what you and I are charged with or commissioned with is to be available as a channel to make sure that everything that all God has laid out before us to do that our life is lined up with that now there's many things friends around our lives we do not need someone to Stand Here a prophet to stand here and discern what is wrong in our life because the word is the discerner there are things that the scripture tells us that is written in the word of God as far as God's will what what comes down to is is whether or not not that we in our lives allowing the word of God even during our time of devotion getting into the message of the hour and really inviting God to examine Our Lives I'll tell you when we invite God to examine our lives and then if there's anything that's wrong the prophet said ask God to remedy it and then then our hearts become an open available channel for divine inspiration to fall into you see we God gives us his word that then as the word would come forth that Lord I want my life to be washed I want it to be clean I want it to be ready I want to be walking in Step because when faith is needed I want there to be a place I want to be in position for Faith to drop that's the same way it is for the Rapture the Rapture it comes just like it was in the time of Enoch it was that where Enoch was walking with God when Enoch was raptured it was just another day in the life of Enoch amen he walked with God it wasn't all of a sudden one day he got really serious and then boom Rapture no he walked with God Faithfully That's what the Bible said before his translation he had this testimony when before right before right so when we look at this you know Noah all of his inabilities uh my what God called him to do to construct and build an ark I mean he's a farmer but God God gave him this Revelation and through that Revelation Noah would stand and be persevering where where there was no matter any of his inabilities of uh you know maybe he couldn't even cut a board straight or you know let alone doing other things he he just God did not choose him because of his natural abilities but God chose Noah because already before the Foundation The World God already saw all of this in his mind and that word struck Noah's heart and Noah in order for this to come about Noah had to die to himself every day every through every challenge he had to die to himself when it got hard when the situations went he felt like perhaps like you and I do sometimes when we get in things over our head and we say you know what this Plumbing job is too much call a plumber I'm in over my head right now or call this or call this or call brother so so call this but you see Noah himself when God gives a revelation our dependency is on the one who spoke to us not on ourselves not on anybody else it's on God Amen is that right now he held to this Revelation and that Revelation you know it brought it brought Noah through and and God gave him Grace within it that to persevere beyond all of his understandings and I I want to to go on here to a place and just to say every time that God speaks to our heart every time when the word comes forth I I want God I I and my desire is Lord that you would reveal yourself to us Lord reveal what you what the furtherance of your will is for my life is that your desire and even as we're coming to hear the word of God there's right after even hearing the word of God now I know there's times where there's things that right here while the word is taking place sometimes there's things that we can see not only what takes place on the inside but then there's change that can take place just like that but let me tell you when God gives you his word it's the word that produces the change because it's the word that creates the atmosphere and even after you leave out of these buildings when you get out there on Monday morning the word that you have received there the test is going to come and say Lord help me Lord God let me die more to my will let me die more to myself that the word that you spoke might come to pass I want you to think of this here there this with Abraham the Bible says right after this when this we get a little Glimpse on this this is just on my heart on the between here and there we have a little Glimpse on this with Abraham where the Bible says by faith when he was tried he offered up Isaac and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son of whom it was said that in Isaac shall thy seed be called accounting that God was able to raise him up even from the dead from whence he also received him in a figure now I want you to think of this the resolve of Abraham's Faith now I want you to watch the Abraham's faith it there was a real true faith in Abraham all the time but that Faith had to mature and the only way that Faith matured was not god pushing him or pulling him he had decisions he had to make in his life and Abraham made some wrong decisions Abraham made some decisions where he got under the influence of others and some of the influence he got under was was his own feeling of compassion in the gate of his affection and he kept lot and his father with him is that right that's good this is why when God opens up Genesis 12 and the Lord had said not it wasn't a new message coming God was saying hey I'm pointing you back remember what I asked you to do do back here before you ever left the valley of shinar it's not been complete yet aren't you glad that God brings you in I back with his word and says wait a minute here the reason there's no progress the reason things sometimes aren't going forward is is we need to examine have I done all that God has asked me to do right up to this point you see we do not want to become under the spirit of this lady o seean age that just thinks that well I'm a part of a church and you say Well when we're around the message of the hour that Spirit don't stay out there that spirit it's a part of the lady oan age as to where then you know well we've got this knowledge and we know God sent a prophet and I know this Doctrine and I know that but remember God's not going to Rapture doctrines the only thing that's going to be raptured is our character and that character can only come to pass by the character of life that's on the inside of us listen when we're raptured the books and texts will be here my Bible will be here but what's going back is the Living manifested Word that's what he's coming for Hallelujah glory be to God Amen and Abraham what a faith it was such a resolve within his heart Abraham had become so in tune with God that that by of the surrendering of his will and that inner man that that the preeminence in his life was God's desire that that's not something that just it just happened and it didn't just happen from him sitting in a message Church it didn't happen just because you know he was sitting around and hearing wonderful Ministry that happened because Abraham was making a decision from within and laying his will on the altar right that's why when the word speaks to in order for the word to come to pass it requires sacrifice think of it in your life and my life how could we ever live this life that we have now I can't live this life you can't live this life it takes him to come inside of you and I it takes him to bring the real change on the inside it takes God to deal with the heart on the inner man on the inside then it's no longer I that liveth but it's Christ that liveth in me that's beautiful so how did that come by sacrifice right that we might live right now think of this the surrendering of his will you know when you look at this here in the scriptures and think of how that the Bible would tell us that you know over and over when you just just look at the thoughts on the heart and that's what God's after God's not after our mind Satan Satan chose the intellect now remember you can start with an intellectual Faith that'll bring you up to the Holy Ghost but the Holy Ghost is where it moves from intellectual Faith to a supernatural Faith down on the inside because an intellectual Faith you never want to just stay there but an intellectual faith is a start but God's desire is that we would be fully fully Sons and Daughters of God by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit that's the only thing that can bring a real change of our nature that's the only thing that brings a distance between that between that of the world and us that's got to be a death to self and Christ himself moving on the inside and raising up that new life that new man that only he himself can do is everybody with me so I want you to think of this that the Bible said that as a man thanketh in his heart so is he that's why we we've got to make sure that everything our heart is lined up with God cuz see whatever is in the heart will always come out right this is why when the Bible said as a man thanketh in his heart so is he when God went to choose a king he's not the one who chose Saul God simply said what you want I got the man that'll match what's in your heart come on he went Saul was not not a man after God's Own Heart that's what was in their heart and God warned them be careful of the desires of your heart of where to lead you to God even let them know this is your choice I'm not going to make it for you but I'm going to warn you what's going to happen to your children they're going to become enslaved in bondage they're going to be taken in I'm going to warn you of what's going to happen because the desire of your heart and look what happened the desire of the heart brought forth a manifestation now if that would take place in manifesting that what about when God brings forth in our life a real Godly desire amen what about when that desire when that word is dropped in our heart will it not produce what the word is called for when that desire is there that'll match I say God I want my heart's desire let Lord every desire in my life if there's something that's not right Lord I want the word Lord I want the word to clear it out make me aware of it Lord so I can guide to myself I don't want that thing coming forth in my life so to think when God God's desire for you and I and this is always God's desire every time God you look through Abraham's life Abraham comes into the land he don't know he's arrived in the land but when he comes into the land that that God said I'll show you God speaks to him and immediately Abraham sets up an altar you find it when God spoke to Gideon soon as God spoke to get here's an altar on on and on you find an altar you know why because the altar itself it speaks of sacrifice and it speaks of the sacrifice of these things right here our will and our heart notice when Gideon himself even when God spoke to Gideon and he put that he put that offering on the on the altar you know what yes the offering was consumed but do you realize that as that offering was being consumed what was also taking place in Gideon's life is more of Gideon's will was being consumed I said God consume every bit of us Lord I want the word to consume every bit of my life I I don't want to take it off my off the altar when it's venient but I want to leave my life on the altar I want to continue to die to myself this is where the Lord Jesus said we must bear that cross daily dying to ourselves daily oh God help us this is where this is where the battle would come in think about even the heart itself and how God's desire would be on that of the heart where even David would say don't only let the words of my mouth but the med meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight oh God even in Isaiah 53 when it would speak of how that God himself would look down upon the sacrifice and the Bible said he would see the travail of his soul you see God isn't isn't looking and all consumed with everything that's out here but God is consumed with what is on the inside this is why friends the message is not something that has come to move us in our thinking to give us some oh this is a better thinking and and this is some no the the message the word the gospel it comes to bring a change and a Deliverance it comes to deal with the heart because when God has the heart in his hand then everything else will change that's so good yes sir Hallelujah this is why when you think of this we're familiar with this when come here into the Garden of Gethsemane think of it right think of this I want you just to just pay close attention this now here in the Garden of Gethsemane God himself has stepped down to be our sacrifice Our Redeemer the one who would pay the penalty of sin's debt that he might release his life back into you and I now then remember what watch now the prophet tells us predestination because predestination is not you or I just getting you know one day we start thinking about God and we go to a Sunday school and all of a sudden we're reading and we're memorizing scriptures and then all of a sudden the seed is put in us that is not the Bible that's good is that right we were always his seed the the Bible tells us in Galatians 4 that you've re you've received the Holy Ghost because you are Sons Amen on and on we could go Paul wrote of on and on we get all the way through the scriptures it's not just isolated portions you say brother Samuel what are you saying that this is a drama that's being acted out and God himself when he came down he never came down in a halfhazard way he never came down with wondering will there be some individuals that will feel sorry for me and and you know they'll be moved they'll make a movie about me and people will be moved for just day week month whatever maybe somewhere actually they were moved to actually start going to church and give their life to God but he didn't come for that he came that he might redeem his children that were with him he forew in his mind that's why he came Hall so it wasn't a halfhazard event it wasn't just something that's just thrown up in the air god already laid out the plan plan the whole plan think about how the Lord Jesus here he is coming to this point in his ministry this is this is this is a climax in this Earthly Ministry and here he is coming and he prays three times this very prayer oh my father if it be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not as I will but as thou Wilt that that was not an act am God so condescended that he was able to feel the Bible said he learned obedience through the things that he suffered Hallelujah here he is he's feeling that pain because knowing what awaits him knowing the the test knowing what aits him with the with the calvary knowing what awaits with the cross but he knows he this is all the way down you read it in John 10 or John 10 John 12 you read all the way down the Lord Jesus even as he stood in Pilot's Hall this purpose has not been exempt from his life he has walked with this purpose the whole time it was this purpose that was in his heart that when Peter sought to lay hold and said it shall not be so Thou shalt not be crucified and he turned around and he said get thou behind me Satan right for thou you don't esteem the things of God it wasn't Peter Peter was not Satan but Jesus was able to discern the spirit that was trying to take him away from the purpose that he was called for oh God may God help us give us Grace continually in our lives to discern yes yes Amen brother Samuel my my boss no I want you to think how close to was Peter that's how close it was don't don't AR getting your mind on on somebody that's not what I've said that for I've said that for this for this point is so that you and I have to understand what God has asked us to do that's between you and God that's that's good Hallelujah there can be a lot of things that can come to try to reason you away from it because why that was that would have been better for who not for me that would have been better for the Lord Jesus if he would have taken that way went that way that would have been better for him in the sense of he wouldn't have had to Die the death that he died but he made a choice based on the word and when he made a choice based on the word it was a choice that held him and gave him strength to continue to submit himself to the will of God Amen yes and in this time this is where the Prophet speaks to us this is where that prevailing victory was at was where in gemane right Gethsemane the place of the olive press where all of the life is squeezed out Gethsemane is where he prevailed and overcame or you say oh no that that was on Easter morning that was only the manifestation that's right that's only a manifestation and let me tell you it started back even further than Gethsemane right or you say it his birth it went further back than that Hallelujah and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship him talking about that Beast that religious system whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world so where where did this all begin it again in the mind of God God was settled in his heart I'm going to do this before there was ever a devil God had already settled itall are you hearing me it was already settled this is why the very thing this is why Satan is always wanting us to get our attention away from the heart it's the heart that matters God sent a message to turn not our heads but our hearts back to him this is why so many times even as we we come sometimes in a service and oh how God Is So dealt with our hearts and my our hearts are so touched and so warmed then we get out of church goes maybe for days and maybe it goes for weeks and all of a sudden we find ourselves pulling back from what God is wanting us to surrender to that's so good this is why this is why that this is not a drive-thru Chick-fil-A has a very efficient drive-thru most efficient drive-thru okay I'm not trying to bring props for that company but this is not a drive-through I'll just be quite honest with you there's a lot of things in my life I'd love for it to be drive-thru I'd love to order it at one end and by the way have some more people out here so I can move quicker I got things to do I got Life to Live let me tell you something your life right here is not about you the life and the span that we have here you say how do I know I don't know our span between here and there I don't know I don't know how long that Dash is I don't know what that is until from now until the body change or you or I go beyond the veil of time I don't know what that is but in the meantime everything that matters what matters is what we have done for his kingdom because you can dig down and you'll find no notice the archaeologists dig down and they'll find the names of Moses they'll find the names of their pharaohs and everything else they're buried beneath the Earth but those that have surrendered their lives to God that's what lives on am I tell you friends I I mean this With all sincerity in my heart I could stand at a funeral and hear accolades after accolades that a person did but what everything that mean what means in my heart is do they know the Lord Jesus Christ in his resurrection power because everything else will not [Applause] matter this is what matters this time this moment that we have between here and there right I think of how that he gathered here was this was settled there I love how brother BR says this this this statement in Gethsemane he said Gethsemane laid just before him where that once and final all sufficient test must come when the burdens of the entire world laid upon his blessed shoulders there was no one in all Heavens or Earth could ever stood it but him and to know that all of the sins of past sins present sin sins future sins rested upon this decision so he didn't have to he don't have to come back if you made a mistake he don't have to come back and go to Calvary again when when he touched your life and made you aware that I am your sacrifice you know what he's doing he's not so much attaching attaching you to just a a place called Calvary he's taking you back to the mind of God where in his heart he made that decision that I will lay down down my life for you Calvary was a manifestation of what was settled in God's heart oh God let it be settled in our hearts I'm talking about friends even as we walk on with God as we move on brother bam said that was one of the greatest victories that Christ ever won or proved his messiahship notice one of the greatest ones you know we might look at that and say Well when he said not my will thine will be done the greatest victory that was won all the Demons of Torment was around to tempt him and try him why why to stop from what God's purpose was for him you think you think that you think even when we leave out of this place you think that the spirits don't want to try to gather sometimes you wonder why things you start feeling the way you do after you've left church you know we would love to be able to bottle this presence right here and let me just tell you this presence is not confined to this building he made a promise that he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you come on now you might say well brother Samu I don't see my life you know all the way tting up but if there's listen now if there's a desire in your heart to be fully fledged as a Christian that is the holy spirit up on your life that is creating that hunger and that thirst [Applause] Hallelujah his presence listen now all you say well I just want his presence to continue around my life I want that word because it will take his presence to bring it to pass as our will is continually surrendered to him sometimes the simplest of things of when we we can get we can kind of pull back yeah you know Jer Jericho was a great Victory right you have to be careful because after great victories is a Temptation for complacency yeah they came to Joshua and said everybody don't need to get out of bed this morning send a couple thousand up you said well that was because of achin remember what that spoke of When sin was in the camp When sin unbelief gets in the heart you say well what is unbelief and doing this and doing that listen there are many attributes of unbelief but one of the things always to evaluate is where is our trust and our Reliance are we relying upon oursel or relying upon my oh what a wonderful day in service the devil is going to be right on our tracks he's the devil's not looking at one thing and saying my what a wonderful service that was I'll just back away no he's going to tear right into you and I you might say brother Samuel I came to hear encouraging words God is speaking encouraging words he's letting you and I know that you know what the enemy you know this is what's been going on and Satan's desire is to try to knock everything out of you that God is wanting to put in you right there's no portion of the promised land that you'll ever take and it not be contested every inch that you have in God it'll always be contested is that right I want you to think of this there's where there's always some preparations let's get back to Abraham for for a moment there's always preparations and precautions that we have to take right remember how brother Bram talked about he said after you're prayed for he said what's the company you're keeping is that right he said because if you're not careful you get around people who don't believe in Divine Healing and all of a sudden that situation will come right back this is let me just say this very very clearly and the spirit of God is able to bring this to your heart if there's something you're battling with or you're struggling with don't yoke yourself up with like a self-help group of people with the same things you know why because it's Spirits Binding Together but yoke yourself to the word this is what God has said in his word and I'm going to stand with God I'm going to take his word I'm not I'm not you know looking down on somebody else I I just don't want to get around the same channels of influence amen that's right sometimes you see what it is we're we're wanting well well it's got to be done right here in the house of God there are things that God does right here and sometimes we get to such a place to where we we want things done and we get out of the presence of God and then we become seeking oh I I got to get into where wherever his presence is at I need to go here where the princess I got to go it's got to be so strong that's that's God only melting our will to his word there are many things that will take place in a moment in a twinkling of an eye but in this situation that I'm reading right here with Abraham this is a journey many times that you and I are on that when God speaks to us he doesn't do it right at that moment but he asks us will you surrender to my voice hey I'm with you I'm with you I want you to notice this when God asked Abraham and he asked him to take his only we read this in Hebrews but I want you to notice this are some things I want to draw your attention to God knew he said I want you to take thine only son Isaac whom thou lovest God's asking him to take the very evidence that he gave him and destroy it God's testing him to see what does he love most see God will allow situations God will sometimes will permit situations to come to test us do you love your job more than me that's so good wow do you love husband or wife or anybody listen friends I love my wife and I love my children but I do not love them more than I love God right that's good if they go on their merry way adios see you I'm not saying that to be cruel you say well brother Samuel you really can't say that I can say that but what's in my heart there's been friends that I've had that have walked away from this very truth and I wept right in my office floor when things that they expressed to me over the phone and I tried oh God trying to to minister to them and it wept I didn't even want to believe it that they were departing but you realize it's not my fortitude it's not it can't be your fortitude you understand it's got to be something deeper than your resolve it's got to be a divine revelation in your heart that's not an option that's a must amen amen Lord I've got to have this or I've got to know no I've got to have you amen it's your will it's your will because inside of his will that's where the blessings lay that's right that's where we're tested I want you to notice this Abraham in this scripture right here of of verse three after God telling him this Abraham rose up early in the morning Abraham didn't say I know what God's asking me to do I'm going to unplug the alarm clock he's making preparations and he's taking precautions are you hearing me now you say what kind of preparations is he making he's even chopped up the wood and said Isaac I want you to put this wood in a special little sack and if Mama asked us where we're going if she just happens to get a rouse you know how mamas can get they they can then my mothers once the children come along there's a feather can drop and Mama's up it says I want you to make sure just tell her we're going to go and worship now watch this he makes preparation you know for God he's taking Isaac he's taking the wood he's taking all this you know it's like this I know I may it may be a carnal example but you just have to take it as it comes it'd be like you and me and you saying let's meet for lunch tomorrow I okay and I know it'd be best if I left my wallet in the car and I can say my wallet's out in the car you know what I haven't made preparation but what it is I'm trying to go around I'm trying I know what's required but I know what I know what's possibly going to be required of me so so not let and not I don't I don't want to make that preparation but Abraham you see what all of this is it's not a show it's what is in Abraham's heart amen amen this is what's in Abraham's heart brother Bram says it like this I've always loved these quotes brother Bram says poor old Abraham he didn't want to wake Sarah up and tell her about it so he got up early and took the little boy and the two servants and their little mule and he chopped the wood and put it in a sack with something and took off into the Wilderness brother BR says in paragraph 13 3 he says you watch he said Abraham couldn't tell Sarah the wife that pretty little Jewish boy about 12 years old going to take him up and cut his throat that would have been a horrible thing to tell mama he couldn't tell her right he couldn't do it now you we could you know we could play the you know the part well that's your wife but you know there's some things the Bible says don't let your left hand know what your right hand's doing sometimes there's things that God is dealing with your heart on he doesn't want the rest of the world to know about he just wants your heart to be in tune with his voice and to be so consumed with Lord and your thy will be done in this earth even as it is in heaven God consume me that's the whole part when God speaks to us consume me Lord consume me there's many examples here I had many other examples within last week and I all of just had to get spaced out from last week and even some other examples that I have in here that should be very encouraging to us because sometimes we read and look I could go through things within Abraham's life you know of other times where Abraham himself and with Hagar and all of those things that come along interruptions along the way and in the journey but it never changed who Abraham was right is that right sure there's things that Abraham had to deal with he had to deal deal with ishma when all of a sudden Abraham came around and realized it was wrong God didn't take him down and say ishmael's gone nope God said no that I'm going to you know what as as a Son of God those are things that now you're going to have to receive my grace to be able to deal with some of that Harvest right everybody with me yeah this isn't a shouting message and I'm not really trying I'm not trying to work it that way I just want the word tow drop that's that's really what it is I want this word to drop because this is what translates out of even other services other meetings is what takes place within our will see I don't want to get under an anointing I don't want you to get under an anointing I want our will to be surrendered to the anointing of the person of Jesus Christ because anointing is not emotion not against emotion but I can give you a Litany of quotes but I'll give you one perfect quote why people are so tossed about to think about the title of that message brother Bram even after preaching it comes to the end of that message and he says think of it there was never a person more anointed than the Lord Jesus and he sat down and taught the word that's so good the prophet said see anointing isn't running all over that's good anointing is a supreme power in control knowing how and what to do that's real anointing yes sir so to think of this here I want you to think of this for a moment and brother brandham even in his life you know there's things there's examples even where God as he would you know with Abraham you know when Nehemiah came back in the land Nehemiah when he came back from Babylon he knew what he was commissioned to do build the walls but he didn't go right away and tell everybody right he went out and surveyed the walls himself first looked at him and then he went and told the Brethren so sometimes there's there's a season of when to make something known that's is that right and the Bible said when he did that then the scripture said that the hand of God was upon the people to strengthen them I want you to think of this some of the brothers remember when we were at the the men's meeting this is one thing that struck me with within this think about mishaa and Misha Walker Every most of as as as message Believers when you've read this even in the life story of brother bradam and you read this and you recognize of how that the prophet himself he has received my what a what a wonderful thing has taken place at Mishawaka he's seen those those gifts being in operation but what it was it wasn't so much the gift that he's attracted to but he sees within it there's one of them in the speaking in tongues and interpreting that one of them is a genuine Christian beneath the gift then he sends there and he sees that beneath the gift of another one this guy's a hypocrite his wife is you know I can't remember if his wife was a brunette and he's living with a blonde whatever was the Bible said gifts and callings are without repentance the rain falls on the just and unjust this is why this is why you never ever base your uh your your foundation and who you are upon a gift because the prophet tells us in Harvest times Satan can hand out gifts by the handfuls amen hallelujah is that right nobody could out preach Judas right he was a great preacher he had he shared understanding the prophet said in the Mysteries so it's not the gift but so often in our Humanity we can we can be so attracted by gifts that's so good now we love the supernatural but the supernatural should always be held to the word test I don't care who it is how long they've been around the message the supernatural should always be brought to the urum are you hearing me yes now notice this here here the prophet is standing and he has seen this this great display and of what has taking place and remember he gets all the contacts to go and you know Minister here minister there and man he's got you know he's he's got a a calendar full of going and ministering in those churches remember he was he was the one that went up there and you know he didn't want to go and Minister uh they were calling Billy brandom and the guy next to him you know say oh here he is when brother BR makes him known see God God was making a way but I want you to notice this here when you go when you look at this when he comes back he makes one mistake he comes back and like you and I have done sometimes we're so elated and we share things that we shouldn't share I've always marveled at this brother BR says it this way he says this is his mother-in-law all right yeah after he tells her what's going to what what they're going to be doing she says the very idea that you think you drag my daughter out among stuff like that sorry I have a little bit of chuckle there ridiculous that's nothing but trash that the other churches has throw out she said indeed you'll not bring my daughter out like that wait a minute it's my wife it's my wife you see another this is a spirit at work sure domineering are you hearing me now it's a domineering Spirit Y and I said but you know Mrs bubuk down in my heart I feel that the Lord wants me to go with them people she said you go back up to your church my goodness until they are able to afford a parsonage for you and act like a man that's got some sense sounds like she had a little bit too much Liberty you're not taking my daughter out there I said yes ma'am and I turned around and walked out hope started crying she said Billy regardless of what mama says I'll stay with you amen that's tremendous bless her heart she said oh that's all right honey brother Bram says I just let it go in other words all those invitations for a year I just let it go he was so excited it was in his heart I'm gonna go oh my this is wonderful what God has opened what God has revealed it's in his heart but now through his mother-in-law it's knocking it out of him he's allowing it of what God has put in him he's allowing this are you hearing me now right the humanity don't bother me and I just let it go she wouldn't let her daughter go with such people that CA it was nothing but trash and so I just kind of let it go it was the worst mistake I ever made in my life one of the worst what was the worst what was it you see if we could take this for an example brother Brandman over and over in my life story he would tell us use my mistakes as stepping stones of God's grace for you I can tell you friends every one of us we have not experienced this kind of extreme things but there's things that God has asked us to do or he said don't do or he say spoke to our hearts and when we don't continue in with it sometimes we can get around other people and you know I I don't know this is what was spoke to my heart and all of a sudden through from here to there what God has dealt with our heart and what our will and our heart has been put up on the Altar and yet through those conversations from here to there we actually don't arrive there what's in here it becomes lessened and lessened W and lesson how does that happen because you have to battle right through these Gates reasoning right well you don't think God would want you to do that you don't listen you have to come to this place and your walk with God your walk with God has to be between you and God Amen you want the we want the effectiveness in our lives we want Christ to be effective it has has to be between us and him through that then our lives become channels for God to operate through here is this battle let me let me just try to wrap this up here here's this battle three days I just just was just meditating and pondering on this and I've looked at these things here three days I mean why didn't God just say take him out back you're going to offer him up now I could preach on Mount Mariah and go into Mountain Zion I go into all that but I'm saying why did God we understand there was a type but why did God say three days journey why didn't he just say take him out back God was showing here even in a type even if was it come to our life he could have placed it God could have placed it ever so close it's like this why not there's things that here when we come to the house of God and I I'll be honest there's things as we come here look friends I don't want you to ever put that things are way out here and it has to happen days later but this is what you need to be looking for if we can maybe just really our our our our Focus be so tuned into this is God the most important thing whether the manifestation takes place now or later let my heart be inclined Amen to your your will amen like David said thou has said chase after me my heart set after thee will I seek oh God God Speak to My Heart Lord let my heart be moved into position Lord that's what I want today not my intellect let my heart be moved into that place to say y the challenge is great the requirement is great but God speak to my heart drop Into My Heart Lord what's needed but as I walk these days in this journey brother Bram would say it like this the message why Christ speak he says we see the message come forth we Ser that we see the church rise to a place on the wings of the Holy Spirit until the power of God Thrills every person in there the glory of God Falls around and signs and wonders take place less than a week Satan is permitted to come into that congregation God doesn't move and then say oh no no no no no no no you can't touch them you know what it is it's the word being tested where has the where is the word at if the word's only listen if the word's only as deep as in our intellect it can be talked out of us but if the word's got to make its way to our heart amen we've got to St stand there like a real Steward on the inside and close off every other gate sometimes we we look at things like examples I was giving you last week of how that between the here and there where the grizzly bear God brought forth a grizzly bear the sister I can't remember her last name but here she is passing through a prayer line dealing with anxiety and nervousness is so bad and the spirit of God standing right there says you'll find out in about a year and a half from now it'll break yeah wow now God could have broke that right there right do you know what that was showing God's Got Confidence he knew what lay in her if you could have asked her the same way you would asked me I would say Lord I don't know if I can make it for 18 months that's how my intellect would look at it that's how my flesh would look at it but God's looking deeper than the flesh he gave her a word and all of a sudden 18 months later she's driving in the car and the prophet said here the joy of the Lord filled the car and it broke I say when God has given you a word for healing don't ever turn that loose don't ever turn it loose because between here and there God will fulfill his word is that right the prophet when he came off of the mountain there and he says it on the wings of a snow white dove after God has revealed to him the deliverance and healing of your stomach trouble it's over it's finished and the prophet announces from the pulpit he said I'm not going to fear it no more he says God has healed me he didn't know that his healing was going to be coming in a few days but it wouldn't be on this side it would be on the other side God still kept his word yes he did true God still kept his word so Lord help us to leave our heart and our life there on the altar I want you to think of this here like with Abraham and I'm not going to I just refer to a few of these quotes that out of the same message Abraham's Grace Covenant you know brother brandom I love how the spirit of God will take us into these places to help us to see into this spot where you and and I are right the things we battle through after the word has been delivered to our hearts now on this 3day journey he leaves he leaves them and he tells those men this is what he tells them we just read it I and the lad are going to go Yonder and worship and come again brother Braham said the devil stood right beside Abraham and said you just told a lie the devil said you just told a a lie because God's asked you to offer him up but Abraham's Revelation is this is what God promised this is the evidence when God said I'll be the father of Nations this is the evidence right here and there's no way that God is going to take away this evidence but he'll raise it up let me tell you every time that God asked you and I to step into his word and surrender our will he'll always provide for you what is greater than what you walked up on Mount Mariah with hallelujah hallelujah Abraham walked down off Mount Mariah with a greater Revelation where the voice of God had said thy sea shall possess the gates of thine enemy hallelujah what put the RAM on the mountain Abraham's faith am Satan was trying to get him take your will off the altar take your heart off the altar but Abraham when all this was going on praise the Lord Satan speaking to him brother Braham said here's Abraham's response to the devil oh no it's not a lie there's something down in here that he tells me if I even have to kill him I've received him as one from the dead God could raise him back to Earth again the lad and I will return turn why because God already told me that through this land I will there will save Nations he changed my name put h on the end of my name you see what he's doing you see what he's doing he's doing the same thing that the prophet told us in spoken word or spiritual food and due season he said let this things that God is doing be accumulated in your heart right now let it build you up into the faith of this hour Abraham is reaching back that test that he facing right there where Satan is trying to get him and pull him back from surrender but he keeps on going back to the evidences this is what God did in my life this is what you this is what God did in my life God changed my name God brought me out of the year of Cales it was God's longsuffering for me when lot I let lot hang hang around and it was God's grace that allowed that separation to go he was able to go through evidences in his life that gave him strength that's right to continue to to submit himself to God's [Music] voice Braham said could you imagine what was slipping through Abraham's mind his human mind up there all of these things his intellectuals going on see his reasoning the reasoning coming in through the gate of reasoning how how's this going to be how you going to be a father man how you killed this boy that don't make sense you kill him God's asking you to do this how is this going to happen brother say he's going through all those intellects he's moving through all that he said but when the intellects begin to work there was a little buzzer on the inside that kept saying what did he believe me 25 years for though see that buzzer on the inside was that hid man of the heart when them when that wrestling match was going remember the prophet said you to have something on the inside that's able to break the toe hold of the devil ever felt like you've been in a place where you're ready to tap out oh yeah maybe for five of us we can go out in the parking lot and preach for five of us maybe at sometimes you've come to a spot and you feel like I'm ready to tap out it seems like how the enemy's got you you know in a headlock or he's got you in an arm bar he's got you in some way or maybe you're leg and you're getting ready to tap out but there's a hidden power on the inside that allows you to break that stro hold you know what that hidden power is it's the word of God to submit my will to God's Will and it breaks the hold of the enemy because greater is he that's in you than he that's in the worldall let me tell you what God has called you to do he's walking right with you he's leading you the whole way it was not when they got on Mount Mariah that God met him God was walking with them the whole time Abraham was fiing the whole time Abraham was casting down reasonings the whole time Abraham when things wanted to try to to come his way he stood on that word that's good yes sir that's so good say God God help us that this be the testimony in our lives we've had some Mission Walkers I've had some Mission Walkers yeah I remember one time God I just started preaching remember one time this is just this one of many man I I thought man here I am I'm going to preach and I was down down south and man I'm getting ready to go and all of a sudden the Holy Spirit on the way when I'm driving is telling me go over here to Jude and I want you to preach on this and I said I don't got no notes for that I don't got no notes for that I hadn't even sat down and real you know and you know what you say what did you do well I sat there and I battled and I wrestled in that hotel room you know what I did I preached a set of notes that I had and I didn't follow the lord it was one of the biggest flops and yet that service I had already preached it in other places that God had led me to preach it you know what it taught me it didn't mean that there still don't have those those times come but sometimes I wonder if that's why God will put it on me sometimes when right before I get ready to come out you'll change it and sometimes changing it it's only just I've got this but I know that inspiration is burning because it ain't about the length of notes you're always studying it's it's always be instant in season out of season ready for God to move but that's just one that's just one example it was like the same thing that were when God is this okay right it was like when God I you know 10 years ago when I stepped away resigned from teaching you know that very next year I called back my my principal and she said Sam she said we we could sure use your back here our scores have when it really went down she said you can come in and I'll tell you what she said you'll have you'll have a good you know we'll get you back on the salary you'll have insurance and and you know what you can name the hours you want all we want you to do is work on math through for the building man I thought about it the reason I thought about it was not because of those other things of insurance but I thought about it because the desire is you know you always like to help I like to see things go from here to there and you know to help and I said let me pray about it and I spoke to her and I said called her back about a week later I said Donna I said I'm not going to be able to do that and she said I understand I said you see I said everything that took place when I was there I was in God's will at that time right I said said that wasn't because of me I said I just happened to be a channel that God used God gave me wisdom I said but if I came back right now and it's not God's will I said it would be the biggest flop you ever saw I said it's not God's will for me to do that I said I'd love to help you out I would do anything I could and I'll tell you you know how it is when you're praying about things you come to a decision and sometimes you get you almost get scared because I'm looking at that part of it right there I'm like man I you know I have insurance again or you know you're looking at having you know the things some certain things and and you know the security and this and that you're kind of looking at different you're just kind of looking at things all around you and you almost you know you you you start almost trembling am I making the right decision am I making the right decision am am I doing the right thing but I tell you the more this is just from my heart that I from my heart saying Lord you know I want your will above everything that's right my wife was praying about it separately we had talked about it cuz that was going to be a decision there within the home and when we came back together and I told her I said this is where my heart's at on it and she said honey she said that's where my heart's on it too she said I know we're in God's will now I wish I could have that testimony for every single thing I'd really do you probably do too you've got some you've got some victories but we also have some Misha walkers in here too right but God would allow this example for you and I that you and I can see that through this whole journey there's going to be tests but let me tell you there's also Grace just like there was for the prophet there was Grace for him God never cast him away God never said you're not going to be my Prophet God never said I'm not going to use you no more that's not what God Said but what happened is is he had to recognize where he had went astray where he let his heart get away he had to recognize that and I'm glad that God I'm glad that he was man enough to allow us to read these things cuz he could have just edited it out where you and I did not see the humanity of the prophet he could have edited that out but God allowed that to be seen for you and I you know why because you and I go through the same battles I just say this to wrap to W wrap this portion up on this between here and there just on this message here the battle from when God speaks to our heart in a service whether it's a special meeting it's a service right here it's a moment at that time that God's drawing Upon Our Hearts and our heart that's the most important thing is Lord let my heart be surrendered whatever God's dealing with your heart just take it and I tell you just go to prayer about it you don't even you don't have to go out and and discuss it across the dinner just go to prayer about it begin to fellowship with God about it say Lord this is what this is what you're speaking to my heart I I don't want I don't want to result and go back to my reasoning I've I've done that too many times Lord i' I've resoled to this reasoning I've went to this and I've went to that I don't want to walk by my reasoning that's why God's calling us as Abraham's seed to separate from all of those Gates I don't want to be in influenced by my reasoning I don't want to be influenced you don't either Lord let me continue to die to myself the things that God asks us to do Lord I want it I want to continue to submit myself to your voice that has spoke to my heart that this word would come to pass in my life how many times let's just Tak it on a bigger Spectrum here how many times since God's got a hold of your life how many times the enemy's tried to talk you it's no use no use look at you you're a failure it's no use how many times he's tried to talk you out of what belongs to you right that's right he's tried to talk out of you what God has spoken into your heart you know they try to get you in a corner somewhere like somebody getting around say hey come here come here you hear hear this about the boss and like oh no come here come here you got to hear this come here you got to hear this well if it's So Glorious why do we got to go in another room see Satan you know what Satan likes to do he likes to get you isolated he like to get you in one of them closets where you can't even move your shoulders try to get you wedged in in your mind and try to lay everything out well if you do this you make this choice I tell you what oh man what this is going to happen for your family oh no say Lord if this is what you're leading and how you're leading me then give me the grace for this to come to pass and to stay with it amen is that your heart's desire oh God help us let us let us stay there on that place on the altar between here and there because one of these mornings one of these mornings will be changed in a moment and a twinkling of an eye you love him see sometimes this is why the things that even and just these are the things friends these these these thoughts that God has placed in my heart just sharing from my from my heart sometimes these are the things why sometimes we're we're we're the enemy who come around and and whisper in people's ears and they somehow lose interest oh well God's not interested in me and God doesn't care about me and my was in such a powerful service but look at me no no no no let me just say this and I and I say this without without anything to put any down but let's just put the devil on notice we don't have to have a pity party that's still about self that's that's right what to recognize is what God dealt with your heart on you got three days journey God deals with your heart to keep walking with him keep walking with him say I want to live the way he wants me to live I want to live I want to stay there I want my heart to stay there on the altar Lord I don't want to I don't want to I don't want to take my heart off the altar I don't want to take Lord things in my own hand because between here and there God provides what's needed you love him amen let's just bow our heads in word of prayer my I wonder how many would just want to be remembered in prayer this morning as we go to prayer Lord remember me remember me Lord remember my heart my life God bless you bless your hands Lord you know let's just go to prayer Heavenly Father Lord sometimes Lord in the ways that you choose Lord to speak to us and make yourself known to us lord it's well it just it's so beautiful Lord how that God you come to break every bit of confusion and frustration sometimes Lord on the things that we cannot see and don't understand on what's going on Lord but you father you help us to see in the simplest of our lives and our journey Lord how many times that Lord we've all had and we will continue to have Lord of this experiences every promise of God that we receive Satan will always be there to contest it thoughts Lord like went through Abraham's mind reasonings where Satan wanted to try to move into that gate of reasoning but Lord Jesus you're the very strength of our life Lord realizing Lord that when we have been right here Lord in a service in a moment in your presence it's a Time Lord where you will deal so personally with us Lord how many times Lord where we come into that place and our hearts are just come to a place of being prostrated in your presence Lord where you would move our hearts to that place and say Yes Lord not my will but thine be done Lord there was a battle in Gethsemane and there was a prevailing that was done there father all the way back lord to the mind of God to the very Heart Of God then Lord as it comes to our lives Lord there's times Lord we have to Lord throughout you showed us the second time not my will thine will be done a third time not my will thine will be done Lord let this cup pass from me [Music] Lord Jesus forgive us Lord where we've allowed oh God the enemy to have leverage we've pulled back on different things Lord the enemy could whisper things in our minds Lord sometimes maybe Lord like Lord how the enemy tried to whisper through through Peter don't no you don't need to go to Calvary Lord just like it was Lord through Mrs brombeck [Music] Lord one way Lord that you can hear that Lord a mother that was wanting the best interest Lord for her daughter but yet father what she wanted was not the best interest in your eyes the best interest Lord was for her daughter hope and brother brandom to be out on the field ministering the gospel that was the best interest Lord help us we lord are surrounded and encompassed with infirmities the carnality of this life sometimes Lord things that Lord Lord that when we lord God just rubbing shoulders every day sometimes the environments and the pressures Lord the pressures are so great nowadays they're greater than they've ever been Lord that's because Lord the darkness is being pressed together it always gets darkest right before the breaking of the day Lord the Rapture is upon us Lord I pray Heavenly Father May our hearts Lord God be found I want to be deeper Lord in you not in myself not in my will but in your will Lord Lord I pray right here this morning Father you know the needs throughout this congregation you know the hearts Lord I pray heavenly father that you would by your divine grace Lord may you move down lord in such a way Lord Lord if there's any harder life that's gotten off track may they Lord God receive your grace Lord father to be able to recognize the wrong and to step right back in line I'm minded Lord that the prophet in that vision and preview of The Bride there was some at the tail end the very last part they got their eyes on the world got their eyes on the church system got their eyes on the things of the world and they got out of Step but the voice of God called out get back in line Lord that's what you call to our hearts Lord sometimes Lord our hearts our emotions Lord some sometimes Lord the things Lord in our life can get so out of line Lord and we know it just doesn't happen Lord we know there's things that lead to that help us Lord just through the simpleness Lord of things that you've charged us with here this morning taking Lord preparations precautions laying Lord in your presence Lord father from what just started right here in the house of God where the spirit of God has moved upon our hearts Lord and our hearts are submitted to you Lord Jesus it don't have to be right here inside of these walls where manifestations take [Music] place we thank you for it Lord but we know it's not confined to these walls I'm thankful for every manifestation thankful dear God for every miracle that you have done even Within These Walls because some Lord maybe wouldn't have never seen it and we need that lord it's necessary but father the greatest value is to be able to take you at your word to obey your voice help us Lord whether we're on day one day two God help us he had to climb Mount Mariah he had to ascend through a rugged territory but father you were leading Abraham that's where you're leading us Lord as Sons and Daughters of Abraham help us Lord God give strength I pray throughout this congregation lord lord of things that maybe you've dealt with hearts here this morning I know you have Lord there's things Lord that you would have us go back in our minds maybe things that we've let up on Lord things that we should have Lord held to but father just like the prophet said how Satan he's permitted to come right after the glory of God with fall your Prophet would tell us in another place in the message how Satan will try to knock the confidence out of us that God has instilled in our hearts on that Sunday morning Lord help us help us Lord I pray help us Lord help us Lord Jesus we love you Lord how we appreciate you Lord for your mercies Lord like Abraham Lord he was looking he was looking for that [Music] mountain Lord when he saw it that's when Lord God they made their track up that mountain oh God what you've spoke to our hearts and youve called to our hearts may we look for that manifestation in our lives Lord maybe it's things Lord that you've spoken so clearly for us to lay aside to separate from Lord God you'll never ask us to do anything that you haven't already done you'll never ask us to do anything that your grace will not prove sufficient to see us through Lord help us Lord I pray God throughout the congregation Lord for the hands that were lifted up Lord for the hearts Lord that are here Lord may you minister to each of their lives minister to their hearts Lord touch them Lord strengthen them Father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ oh I want to leave the way he wants me to and I want to give oh my maybe if you like to stand there's just no more to give I want to love love till there just no more love for I could never never I love the you know even when you've made a statement some moments ago and it comes back to my heart my mind and I made this statement about if my wife or my children you know when you think about Abraham brother B knew he said regarding lot he said he knew how hard it was for Abraham he said so God helped him God helped him God gave him strength he loved lot things like I've talked about with with my boys and my wife it wouldn't be that I don't love them but you you understand what I'm saying it's where it's Lord It's You above everything else that that that's the way it has to be you know sometimes we can become so interested in trying to keep something you know let's just say for example let's say let's say it was one of my boys and my one of them going astray let's say that I went astray with them to try to somehow win them back I wouldn't win them back it would it would it would drive them further away matter of fact then the then then the effect would be in my life it would be the further effect in my on you said well then how do you win them win them by staying true to the Lord because that scripture I read right here the Bible Never Said by faith Abraham it says through faith Sarah received strength to conceive seed if there's going to be a channel for God to move through in my home Lord let me be that channel let me be that channel let me be that like like that garden hose that's hooked up out here in order to get that water in other places that hose is only a conduit that hose doesn't have any water in it it only allows the water that comes in to travel that's all it does Lord God let me just be a channel let me be an instrument that his life can flow through because you know what the same
