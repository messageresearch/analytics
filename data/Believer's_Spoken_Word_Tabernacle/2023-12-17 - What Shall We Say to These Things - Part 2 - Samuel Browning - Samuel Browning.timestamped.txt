[6:02] amen God bless you Saints uh just wanted
[6:05] to share a little testimony with you um
[6:09] you know how with the Christian walk we
[6:10] always go through just pressures and
[6:13] things but there's sometimes when Satan
[6:15] will lay a a special trap for you I mean
[6:18] a carefully laid trap and uh I had one
[6:21] of those at at work this week and and uh
[6:24] as we heard just a few weeks back at
[6:26] trap isn't meant just for to scare you
[6:29] or something it's meant to destroy you
[6:31] and and that's uh what happened to me
[6:33] this week uh at work just real carefully
[6:37] laid plan and usually they just things
[6:39] just happen real quick you don't even
[6:40] realize it and all of a sudden you're
[6:41] trapped and so I just wanted to share
[6:44] with you I I I know what got me through
[6:46] that trap was not myself uh it was it
[6:50] was the prayers of a a a faithful mother
[6:53] and dad who uh always is praying for me
[6:57] so that's right I I just wanted to share
[7:00] that especially with the young people I
[7:02] know that it can be tough a lot of times
[7:05] it just feels like you have pressures
[7:06] coming from every way and you know but
[7:09] it's such a blessing when you have a
[7:11] Godly mother and dad who who's praying
[7:14] for you because it's going to be those
[7:17] prayers who's going to keep control of
[7:19] the situation when you don't have
[7:22] control of the situation and I I can I
[7:24] could raise my hand and say that's
[7:26] that's the TRU I can say that for for
[7:28] for guarant
[7:29] I I know that day what happened and and
[7:32] it wasn't me or anything I did it was it
[7:35] was the prayers of mom and dad who who
[7:38] kept me through that so I just want to
[7:40] give some encouragement to the young
[7:41] people and then also for for all of us I
[7:44] I just believe we we kind of got
[7:45] marching orders on on Thursday night you
[7:48] brother Samuel said you know we we kind
[7:50] of had marching orders and and and I
[7:51] feel that way too just the time Lord you
[7:55] know if if if we're facing each other
[7:57] that means somebody's backs to the enemy
[7:59] you know and and I just feel it's time
[8:01] for you know for us to to go shoulder to
[8:03] shoulder get the enemy in front of us
[8:05] and just go forward I just feel that in
[8:08] my heart just wanted to to share that
[8:10] and we we just don't
[8:12] know what mind battles or what um traps
[8:17] the Satan might have you know laid for
[8:20] that for for anybody so um I just uh
[8:24] wanted to to share that and just say you
[8:27] know if I've ever wronged anybody or
[8:30] said anything wrong I I truly am sorry
[8:33] and I just ask you to please forgive me
[8:35] and uh I wanted to end with a read a
[8:40] quote here um if I can get my phone
[8:44] open
[8:46] uh so it's from uh brother Samuel had
[8:50] had
[8:52] uh said this or last week of God's WAP
[8:56] gift boy this this just really hit me me
[9:00] said the love of God how God unfolded
[9:03] himself and come at Christmas package
[9:06] was laid and straw the first thing he
[9:09] had was to press against his little head
[9:11] with straw and a dirty piece of swatting
[9:14] cloth wrapped around him the last thing
[9:17] he
[9:17] had was a thorn crown and a dirty rag
[9:21] wrapped over his eyes and hit on the
[9:24] head say if you're a prophet tell us who
[9:27] H you then T to a cross love reaching
[9:35] out we just bow our
[9:39] heads dear Lord Jesus we just come
[9:42] before you in prayer this morning Lord
[9:43] just want to just want to thank you for
[9:46] your kindness
[9:48] Lord love reaching out Lord just it
[9:53] really touched me Lord I just I thank
[9:56] you Lord for what you did on Calvary
[9:58] Lord Lord
[10:00] and just you all pray for for all of us
[10:03] Lord is in these times Lord just i'
[10:07] heard said that the crown of thorns that
[10:09] you wore was for our for our mind
[10:12] battles you had the stripes and the
[10:14] bruises but I I heard the Thorns was for
[10:17] our mind battles
[10:19] and those
[10:21] soldiers they may have thought that they
[10:23] were doing that for entertainment Lord
[10:25] but you had a purpose in it that that
[10:28] crown of Thorns had to stay on it
[10:31] couldn't drop off on the way you still
[10:32] had to go to Pilot's judgment Hall you
[10:35] still had to go down the Via delar Roa
[10:38] Lord and then falling and stuff and you
[10:40] couldn't let that Crown of Thorns fall
[10:42] off so you had them hit your head with
[10:46] the Thorns just to drive it deep to make
[10:48] sure it lasted all the way to Calvary
[10:50] cuz you knew we would have mind battles
[10:52] Lord all the way to the end it's the
[10:55] only thing you wore to the
[10:57] cross I just want to say thank you
[11:00] Lord just help us Lord and I just pray
[11:03] Lord
[11:05] that Lord for these
[11:07] requests the other thing that you did
[11:09] afterwards Lord you went down into the
[11:12] lowest parts of hell it says and you
[11:15] dropped all of our sins there you just
[11:17] left them there and as you ascended back
[11:19] from the lowest parts of
[11:21] hell I believe you looked every single
[11:24] demon in the face and gave them the
[11:26] chance to to say something to try to
[11:29] overcome you so you looked cancer in the
[11:32] face you looked diabetes in the face you
[11:34] looked them all in the face Lord and
[11:37] they had their chance individually and
[11:40] collectively and Lord not a single one
[11:43] could overcome you cuz you are Lord the
[11:46] one that heals all of our diseases Lord
[11:48] and not only physical or but but mental
[11:51] Lord you you you looked suicide in the
[11:54] face you looked at oppression and
[11:56] depression Lord lust and different
[11:58] demons Lord that would also come against
[12:00] US during this last day every single one
[12:03] of them there's just a lion I believe
[12:05] that's roaring in this day Lord just
[12:08] saying in the name of the Lord Jesus
[12:10] Christ let my people go just believe
[12:12] it's that time lord and
[12:15] just Lord there's also one other thing
[12:19] you had to wait for a few moments Lord
[12:21] because you had said in your word that
[12:24] there you was not going to lose one and
[12:26] there was still one up on the cross that
[12:28] you made a promised to a thief that was
[12:31] dying up
[12:32] there and you had said today you'll be
[12:35] with me in Paradise you had to wait for
[12:38] him to draw his last breath so he could
[12:40] go into Paradise so that you could then
[12:42] go up to Satan and say give me the keys
[12:45] and grab the keys of death and hell then
[12:48] go to paradise open the doors say let's
[12:51] go
[12:52] home so Lord we just you didn't lose one

[20:53] testimony I hope I don't

[20:59] for something that was very personal not
[21:02] even my Gomez knew about it but I prayed
[21:05] and I asked God for it every time I
[21:10] tried to go to Puerto Rico to be with my
[21:12] daughter God would just closed that door
[21:15] and I could not go in I would say okay
[21:17] it's not my time
[21:19] yet well as you know Zia I know you're
[21:23] watching and I'm sorry that I'll have to
[21:25] use your name that's my
[21:27] daughter
[21:28] I want to apologize to my daughter in
[21:31] front of my whole
[21:33] church because we tried to be too strict
[21:37] on
[21:38] her we wanted her to do everything just
[21:43] right and my
[21:45] daughter when she graduated she said mom
[21:49] she went with my mom and dad because we
[21:52] were straight I I just hope that it'll
[21:55] help other parents to have a little
[21:58] patience and wait on the Lord to change
[22:00] us do not change your children because
[22:03] God that's the Lord's job yes and I
[22:07] asked the Lord I said Lord all I want to
[22:10] do is lay on my daughter's arms and feel
[22:14] that she has forgiven me and my other
[22:16] two children
[22:20] also when I went and got to the airport
[22:23] I just laid in her arms and I just felt
[22:26] like it was God putting his arms around
[22:30] me and Sylvia I
[22:34] know that the most precious thing I did
[22:37] was to lay in bed by you listening to my
[22:41] church services with you I just couldn't
[22:45] believe it I said
[22:47] Lord this is a gift of gift I don't want
[22:51] no more gifts these are my
[22:54] gifts and I thank the Lord for it and I
[22:57] love my church and I love my people and
[23:01] I just and I just want my

[23:08] their heart like he has your daddy and I
[23:11] and we're po your daddy and I are very
[23:13] sorry that we were too strict on you so

[41:30] Minister while I'm ministering and um we
[41:33] just want to take every one of the other
[41:36] every request I know that that has been
[41:38] given I spoke with um brother Bobby and
[41:42] sister Michelle this morning and uh
[41:45] sister Michelle was just speaking of the
[41:47] pain actually at one point in time
[41:49] thought she was going to have to go to
[41:51] the ER last night and um brother Bobby
[41:55] had just been um up the whole time you
[41:58] know brother Bobby he deals with that
[42:00] that blockage and it comes quite
[42:02] frequently in his in his body and so he
[42:04] was up the whole night and um in a lot
[42:08] of pain and you know sometimes this is I
[42:11] just being just speaking from my heart
[42:13] that CU I know there's others even
[42:15] sitting here that's in pain and I know
[42:18] that you know sometimes there's things
[42:20] that you get woke up with a pain at
[42:22] night and sometimes that's that's what
[42:24] transpires and I think about about it
[42:26] and I look at it and I say Lord this
[42:28] what I'm feeling of discomfort that I
[42:30] have to wait for such a duration of time
[42:32] for that pain to go away wait for the
[42:34] Tylen all to kick in you know but it's
[42:37] in those moments I begin to think about
[42:39] others even more deeply and say
[42:42] Lord what I'm going through is a
[42:45] scratch compared to what they deal
[42:48] with Lord would you just just minister
[42:51] to them
[42:53] amen oh my don't you love the Lord
[43:00] amen probably the enemy in those times
[43:02] he thought man I gave him that pain I
[43:05] thought I was going to discourage him
[43:06] but instead you're looking around and
[43:08] say Lord so and so there brothers so and
[43:11] so sisters so and so Lord what I'm
[43:13] dealing with is a scratch and I really
[43:15] mean that I look at and say it's just a
[43:16] scratch of certain things but God is so
[43:20] good so good so good so good amen I'm

[45:11] that same quickening power Not only
[45:14] would go Lord when these are applied to
[45:17] the needs Lord that's been requested
[45:20] Lord but I'm asking Lord that you would
[45:22] come minister to every heart that's here
[45:26] because every need is just as important
[45:29] Lord you don't rank needs you Lord you
[45:34] could have listed all the diseases every
[45:37] need but you showed us that there's not
[45:40] one that's greater than the other we
[45:43] sometimes recognize Lord and hear
[45:45] certain things and the severity of it
[45:47] but you summed it up Lord by just simply
[45:50] saying I'm the Lord that Health all thy
[45:54] diseases it just lets us know what your
[45:57] thought is concerning it Lord and even
[46:00] in your word by his stripes we were
[46:03] healed amen Lord you just let us know
[46:07] that whether it's cancer whether it's a
[46:09] toothache that doesn't make any
[46:12] difference to you Lord You're Still God

[46:18] merciful you care just as deeply Lord
[46:21] God you come Lord to Lord to minister
[46:24] Lord to the Lord youngest child to even

[46:33] garment so would you help us this
[46:35] morning Lord that we can press Beyond
[46:39] this veil of Flesh go beyond Lord any
[46:42] barriers and this morning oh God lord to
[46:46] receive the very things that we have
[46:49] need of in our lives we ask that you
[46:52] just speak to us Lord in the precious
[46:55] name of Jesus Jesus Christ
[46:58] amen amen God bless you amen thank you
[47:02] musicians I want to go in the scriptures
[47:05] here this morning to 2 Corinthians
[47:07] chapter
[47:13] 4 and
[47:16] uh probably some of you seen the
[47:18] pictures sister Anna's at
[47:20] home and uh she had some real good
[47:24] care say Naomi was right there with her
[47:28] and uh so we just thank the Lord for
[47:30] that and we want to continue to keep her
[47:32] in prayer as well as uh continuing to
[47:34] keep uh brother Bill in prayer
[47:39] here Tuesday has a pet scan and then he
[47:43] uh he's going to leave us for a few
[47:45] weeks and go to
[47:48] Tennessee don't forget your
[47:53] passport I don't know if Tennessee is
[47:55] listed on the third world countryes they
[48:00] not but God is
[48:03] good if my brother hears that I'll know
[48:05] about
[48:07] it I'll just I'll just check and see if
[48:09] he's listening no he's in service right
[48:12] now but I want to I want us just to look
[48:16] at these scriptures these are scriptures
[48:19] as I had some of these as it were just
[48:22] um coming together there on Thursday
[48:23] night but I certainly did not know the
[48:26] direction I was going to take here this
[48:27] morning but just sensing that on
[48:30] Thursday night that I wasn't going to
[48:32] get there and we weren't finished but I
[48:34] want to start in with this and I want us
[48:36] I know a lot of times we quote these
[48:38] this scripture here but I want you to
[48:40] notice the context of it as we go
[48:42] through it in 2 Corinthians chapter 4
[48:45] verse 8 I want you to notice what's
[48:48] being
[48:50] said we are troubled on every
[48:53] side yet not
[48:57] distressed we are
[48:59] perplexed but not in despair now I want
[49:03] you to want you to watch this here Paul
[49:07] is speaking to what is around him but he
[49:12] is speaking when it comes to the second
[49:15] part this is my feelings on it I might
[49:19] be troubled on every side but here's my
[49:22] feeling I'm not
[49:24] distressed so it's balancing when things
[49:27] are around us we are perplexed but I'm
[49:31] not in
[49:32] despair
[49:34] persecuted but not
[49:36] forsaken cast down but not
[49:41] destroyed now let me read this to you
[49:44] may the Lord bless you as you're having
[49:45] your seats let me read these two
[49:47] scriptures out of the Amplified I want
[49:50] to keep you standing there but let me
[49:52] just read these two scriptures out of
[49:53] the Amplified to kind of even fur
[49:55] further setting in the context Paul said
[49:58] we are hedged in or pressed on every
[50:01] side troubled and oppressed in every way
[50:07] but not cramped or
[50:09] crushed we suffer embarrassments and are
[50:13] perplexed and unable to find a way out
[50:16] but not driven to despair we are pursued
[50:20] which persecuted and hard-driven anybody
[50:23] knows Paul Paul was pursued right Paul
[50:27] Paul was on The Hit List Paul had a
[50:30] whole group that was after him as it
[50:32] states in the book of Acts is that right
[50:35] they they were they were going to kill
[50:37] him but God made a way that that the
[50:39] little boy heard what was going on and
[50:41] came back and Paul said well this is
[50:43] what I want you to do you go and you go
[50:46] tell the Centurion right and so they
[50:49] went and they told the Centurion and
[50:51] then they they took Paul out another way
[50:53] but so Paul was definitely one who you
[50:55] could say he was pursued but he follows
[50:59] it but I'm not deserted to stand
[51:03] alone we are struck down to the ground
[51:06] but never struck out and destroyed so
[51:09] this is what I want to present to you
[51:10] before I continue reading was Paul in
[51:13] himself when he would say such
[51:15] statements as we are troubled on every
[51:19] side yet not distressed was Paul being
[51:22] negative when he spoke we're troubled on
[51:24] every side
[51:26] not all not at all sir he was stating
[51:29] present circumstances but those
[51:32] circumstances are not going to Lord over
[51:35] my
[51:37] feelings this is the
[51:39] balance now notice verse 10 let's go on
[51:42] always bearing about in the body the
[51:45] dying of the Lord Jesus that the life
[51:48] also of Jesus might be made manifest in
[51:51] our body for we which live are always
[51:55] Del delivered unto death for jesus' sake
[51:58] that the life also of Jesus might be
[52:01] made manifest in our mortal flesh so in
[52:05] other words as Paul said there's no
[52:07] other way for that character and that
[52:09] life to actually be further developed
[52:12] and expressed through our life than by
[52:15] the breaking down of our will and our
[52:19] Humanity so that Christ might become
[52:22] more visible good PR so the sickness is
[52:26] not against you but the sickness is only
[52:29] permitted by God that through it that
[52:33] through those moments as we are drawing
[52:35] our strength from the Lord that more of
[52:38] him will come on come on display in our
[52:41] life that our character will be further
[52:45] molded so then death worketh in us but
[52:48] life in you now I want you to watch this
[52:51] we having the same Spirit of Faith
[52:54] according as it is written I believed
[52:57] and therefore have I spoken we also
[53:00] believe and therefore speak knowing that
[53:05] he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall
[53:08] raise up us also by Jesus and shall
[53:12] present us with you for all things are
[53:16] for your sakes that the abundant grace
[53:19] might through the Thanksgiving of many
[53:22] redown to the glory of God for which
[53:24] cause
[53:26] we faint not but though our outward man
[53:30] perish yet the inward man is renewed day
[53:34] by day that's the secret of
[53:37] Victory Paul was not being negative when
[53:40] he said the outward man is
[53:43] perishing but he balances it with I'm
[53:47] receiving strength in the necessary part
[53:50] and place of my life in order to live
[53:54] Victorious
[53:55] amidst all of these conditions the
[53:58] inward man is what's being renewed day
[54:03] by
[54:04] day that's true so good that that right
[54:07] there we could preach that not just for
[54:09] when we're dealing with things and
[54:11] issues in our life but to know that
[54:13] every day it's a constant
[54:15] renewal just like in your body when we
[54:18] go to sleep and things like that but
[54:19] let's go on here verse 17 for our light
[54:23] Affliction which now listen if there's
[54:25] anybody that would have author's
[54:28] permission to write like this it's this
[54:31] man cuz I I think it's safe to say no
[54:34] one in here has ever experienced and
[54:38] went through what Paul went
[54:40] through the amount the the perplexities
[54:43] and the things that he went which he
[54:45] describes it in another place of what he
[54:47] went through so for him he's not making
[54:49] light of anyone else's Affliction he
[54:52] didn't say for your light Affliction but
[54:55] but he says our light
[54:58] Affliction this man has got to be
[55:01] looking at something else when he would
[55:03] call it a light Affliction now Paul De
[55:06] said I don't have any Affliction I I
[55:08] don't have none at all no it's a light
[55:10] Affliction that's right so he's not
[55:12] being negative when he's identifying the
[55:15] circumstances that are around him which
[55:18] is but for a moment worketh for us a far
[55:23] more exceeding an eternal weight of
[55:27] Glory while we look not at I I love this
[55:30] verse of scripture while we look not at
[55:34] the things which are seen now this whole
[55:37] phrasing while we look not at it deals
[55:40] with where our minds are
[55:44] centered while we look not at the things
[55:48] which are seen you can become so
[55:51] occupied with what we see feel
[55:55] and here all those things are real but
[55:59] none of those things should become the
[56:01] predominating factor of what we're
[56:04] looking
[56:05] at see that's where the spies were were
[56:08] defeated God never told them you you
[56:11] know you went over there you said
[56:13] there's Giants in the land you bunch of
[56:15] negative people there was no problem
[56:17] with that of them saying there were
[56:19] giants in the land God's not asked us to
[56:23] be Liars Pretenders or to ignore
[56:26] Hallelujah but God has asked us just to
[56:29] look at his word sometimes we' become so
[56:33] occupied with these things and ignore
[56:37] the right thing that is actually our
[56:40] Liberty and source of
[56:42] Victory so Paul look where he's at while
[56:44] we look not at the things which are seen
[56:47] But at the things which are not seen for
[56:52] the things which are seen are temporal
[56:55] but the things which are not seen are
[56:57] Eternal how many know that's a
[57:00] battle it's a battle when you have to
[57:02] look beyond what you feel what you see
[57:06] and what you
[57:07] think is that right this is a battle so
[57:09] Paul is writing it from even from that
[57:12] understanding so when we look at this
[57:15] Paul is not saying that we are to ignore
[57:18] the things that we see or the conditions
[57:20] we find ourselves in but we're looking
[57:23] to a source of strength the Unseen
[57:27] knowing that God is always present now
[57:31] look at this in second Corinthians
[57:33] chapter 6 I'm just trying to set some
[57:35] ground here in 2 Corinthians chapter 6
[57:38] verse 7 by the word of Truth by the
[57:41] power of God by the armor of
[57:43] righteousness on the right hand and on
[57:45] the left by Honor and dishonor by evil
[57:49] report and good report as deceivers and
[57:52] yet true watch this as unknown and yet
[57:56] known yet well known as dying and behold
[58:00] we live as chastened and not killed as
[58:05] sorrowful yet always
[58:08] rejoicing oh my goodness should Paul not
[58:11] have said we're
[58:13] sorrowful he's just stating
[58:16] conditions but what's important is what
[58:20] he looks and how he's approaching those
[58:23] conditions so in other words this was
[58:25] not the end of Paul's Instagram Facebook
[58:29] or SnapChat post all things are
[58:32] sorrowful Emoji upside down sad
[58:37] face that's good that way the young
[58:41] people understand what I'm saying there
[58:44] you as sorrowful yet always rejoicing
[58:50] amen because what where is their defeat
[58:54] in the Army of almighty
[58:57] God yes sir well I know this one passed
[59:00] from this I know this one pass they were
[59:02] not defeated the word of God was not
[59:04] defeated he is still the Lord that
[59:07] Health all thine
[59:09] [Applause]
[59:10] diseases it's where you've got where
[59:12] knowing God personally we don't always
[59:15] know the outcome or the will or this is
[59:17] going to happen this way this is going
[59:19] to happen this way do you have a direct
[59:21] word from God that it's going to come
[59:23] out that way you do not unless he has
[59:26] given you one but you do have the word
[59:29] that says by his stripes I am healed the
[59:34] pathway the journey I don't know the
[59:36] next step but I know he's leading me and
[59:38] I'm going to take his word because he'll
[59:41] show me where I need to put step by step
[59:44] by step by step by step of the way and
[59:47] that's how it is with every part of our
[59:48] walk as a Believer as sorrowful yet
[59:50] always rejoicing as poor yet making me
[59:54] any rich as having nothing and yet
[59:59] possessing all
[1:00:02] things all right Romans 8 verse 18 for I
[1:00:07] reckon Paul's Paul's not a southerner
[1:00:10] but the word reckon means I
[1:00:13] think this is how I
[1:00:16] think I for I reckon that the sufferings
[1:00:20] of this present time are not worthy to
[1:00:24] be
[1:00:25] compar with the glory which shall be
[1:00:27] revealed in
[1:00:33] US never forget when my dad was going
[1:00:35] through he had his open heart surgery
[1:00:38] and he was laying in the hospital there
[1:00:39] in in their and that of the um I can't
[1:00:43] remember what Vincent hospital I think
[1:00:44] that's what the name of it is I don't
[1:00:45] slips in my mind is that what the name
[1:00:47] of it was okay it's what it was well
[1:00:50] when they performed I never forget when
[1:00:52] we came up there the one NE one of the
[1:00:54] other other days and I came in there and
[1:00:56] they they had come into the room and my
[1:00:57] dad's blood pressure was way up and just
[1:01:00] man things were all Haywire well you
[1:01:02] know the nurses and everybody else
[1:01:04] trying to get it together but Dad after
[1:01:06] they left and they're doing some things
[1:01:08] he said here's what happened he said
[1:01:10] this is why that was going on like it
[1:01:11] was he said he said Satan he said he had
[1:01:15] begin to come and wanted to talk to me
[1:01:17] and said you know what your problem is
[1:01:19] this message you're standing
[1:01:21] for if you'll just pull back from it
[1:01:24] I'll let up on you
[1:01:28] wow you think words can't have an
[1:01:31] effect listen if Satan's Satan's
[1:01:35] thoughts coming that way can create that
[1:01:38] take the contrast God's words are
[1:01:41] thoughts of
[1:01:45] Peace so needless to say you know the
[1:01:47] outcome dad dead rebuked him and he fled
[1:01:50] and then all of that began to come back
[1:01:52] down what why do I say that as it comes
[1:01:54] to me right now because to recognize how
[1:01:56] many that when sufferings have happen
[1:01:59] happened they'll turn right away in the
[1:02:01] midst of suffering when that's the time
[1:02:03] you need to hold on that's right that's
[1:02:06] the time to say Lord if I don't feel
[1:02:08] like I've got a grip that I need then
[1:02:10] Lord get a grip on me the way it needs
[1:02:12] to be an anchor to where there's an
[1:02:14] anchor in the midst of this time so
[1:02:16] notice Paul said for I reckon that the
[1:02:18] sufferings of this present time are not
[1:02:21] worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:02:23] which shall be revealed in us once again
[1:02:26] is Paul being negative no he's
[1:02:29] identifying there are sufferings that we
[1:02:31] are suffering but they're not worthy to
[1:02:34] be
[1:02:35] compared Romans
[1:02:36] 8:31 what shall we then say to these
[1:02:40] things if God be for us who can be
[1:02:45] against
[1:02:46] us now it's better to have that word who
[1:02:49] then
[1:02:50] what because any what you say well a
[1:02:53] disease is a what no a disease is a
[1:02:55] spirit it's a
[1:02:58] who so this very thing no matter what
[1:03:01] opposition comes if God be for us who
[1:03:05] can be against us he that spared not his
[1:03:09] own son but delivered him up for us all
[1:03:12] how shall he not with him also freely
[1:03:16] give us all
[1:03:18] [Applause]
[1:03:20] things now think about it when you read
[1:03:23] the whole scripture the whole chapter as
[1:03:24] a Bible reader you know what Paul is
[1:03:27] saying here what shall we say our our
[1:03:29] thinking our consideration when we
[1:03:32] consider that we had not one spec to do
[1:03:37] with our choosing that it's God that
[1:03:40] chose us before the foundation of the
[1:03:41] world it's the holy spirit that has
[1:03:44] sought us out and even the weaknesses
[1:03:47] that are about our life that we don't
[1:03:49] even know how to pray yet the spirit
[1:03:53] helpeth our
[1:03:55] infirmities my Lord not only are we
[1:03:57] chosen our destiny is settled but there
[1:04:01] is a Divine accompaniment through this
[1:04:04] life that when I don't even know how to
[1:04:06] pray don't know what to say but the
[1:04:08] spirit maketh
[1:04:10] intercession with groanings that cannot
[1:04:13] be uttered so what are we going to say
[1:04:16] to these things I'll tell you what we'll
[1:04:18] say if God be for us who can be against
[1:04:22] us so I'd like to continue on that
[1:04:25] thought what shall we say to these
[1:04:30] things the message why it had to be
[1:04:33] Shepherds brother Brown says it like
[1:04:35] this he says you hear so much today
[1:04:38] about positive
[1:04:40] thinking you just put your mind on
[1:04:43] anything and think positive on it well
[1:04:46] the devil can do that there's only one
[1:04:49] thing that rules over all that's God's
[1:04:53] word
[1:04:54] if you are thinking contrary to the word
[1:05:00] forget your
[1:05:01] thinking how many have ever had to do
[1:05:05] that no that if Paul was here Paul would
[1:05:08] have his hands up
[1:05:09] too right sometimes our God will come
[1:05:12] around in such Grace and we realize wait
[1:05:14] a minute I'm thinking contrary to the
[1:05:17] word sister mey helped brother brandom
[1:05:19] there in some of those times too as well
[1:05:21] I can't go into all those examples but
[1:05:23] notice for get your thinking my think on
[1:05:28] the
[1:05:30] word finally brotherr Philippians 4:8
[1:05:33] finally Brethren whatsoever things are
[1:05:34] true whatsoever things are on Facebook
[1:05:37] no that leaves out Facebook
[1:05:40] honest whatsoever things are just
[1:05:43] whatsoever things are pure whatsoever
[1:05:46] things are lovely whatsoever things are
[1:05:48] of good report amen if there be any
[1:05:52] virtue right
[1:05:54] if there be any praise think on these
[1:06:00] things well I tell you if we had applied
[1:06:02] that scripture it' eliminate a lot of
[1:06:05] junk cuz there's a lot of stuff that
[1:06:08] absolutely does not satisfy that right
[1:06:11] there right is that right there's things
[1:06:15] that are true but yet there's also
[1:06:18] another part that has to go with it is
[1:06:20] it honest is it just is it pure is it
[1:06:25] lovely is it of a good
[1:06:28] report is there any vert if there has to
[1:06:30] be virtue in it strength from it amen
[1:06:34] and something that's praiseworthy then
[1:06:37] think on it well let's let's think on
[1:06:39] the word for a few minutes amen Hebrews
[1:06:42] 3
[1:06:43] 1 wherefore holy Brethren partakers of
[1:06:47] the Heavenly calling consider the
[1:06:51] Apostle and high priest of our
[1:06:54] profession Christ Jesus I don't believe
[1:06:57] Paul was just writing words here but I
[1:07:00] believe it was inspired by the spirit of
[1:07:02] almighty God the same spirit of God that
[1:07:05] inspired the writers to write before and
[1:07:08] the words and how that they would write
[1:07:10] I believe it was the same spirit of God
[1:07:12] that would Inspire the writers of the
[1:07:14] New Testament even in their choice of
[1:07:16] words and how that they themselves would
[1:07:19] Express for our walk with God I I don't
[1:07:22] believe that this is a message just to
[1:07:25] look over because how can you consider
[1:07:28] the Apostle and high priest of our
[1:07:30] profession and just be something that we
[1:07:33] skim by we can't he is our all in
[1:07:39] all everything that we have need of is
[1:07:44] in him even the answers that we have
[1:07:47] need of for what's facing us tomorrow we
[1:07:51] are trusting in his leadership and his
[1:07:53] guidance we see through the scripture
[1:07:55] that there were some who went out at
[1:07:57] different times they went away they felt
[1:07:59] like they didn't need to pray they
[1:08:01] didn't need to ask God about this thing
[1:08:02] and they went out there on their own
[1:08:04] what happened their water source was not
[1:08:07] available so they had to come right back
[1:08:10] to the word which if they would have
[1:08:11] began right in the beginning they
[1:08:13] wouldn't have been in that kind of a
[1:08:15] situation so I certainly believe if
[1:08:17] there's one thing that we would need to
[1:08:19] do God help us to consider that means to
[1:08:22] consider or to to attentively fix one's
[1:08:26] eyes or mind upon
[1:08:30] amen a profession and this word
[1:08:34] profession deals with and for sub
[1:08:38] subjectively or subject meaning one whom
[1:08:41] we profess to be
[1:08:43] ours and objectively it's a profession
[1:08:46] is the same word confession what one
[1:08:50] professes or confesses
[1:08:54] now you know what confess means confess
[1:08:57] means to say the same thing
[1:09:02] that's to say the same thing Isaiah
[1:09:06] 53:4 surely he hath borne our griefs and
[1:09:10] carried our sorrows yet we did esteem
[1:09:13] him stricken smitten of God and
[1:09:16] Afflicted but he was wounded let's just
[1:09:19] read this together but he was wounded
[1:09:22] for ours
[1:09:24] transgressions he was bruised for our
[1:09:27] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[1:09:31] was upon him and with his stripes we are
[1:09:39] healed in the message the principles of
[1:09:42] Divine Healing now I want you to watch
[1:09:44] how brother BR approaches this here he
[1:09:46] says the first thing a person does when
[1:09:49] they get sick maybe around home you have
[1:09:52] a few remedies and and things to
[1:09:55] try never forget how that uh brother
[1:09:58] brother Dalton would tell this testimony
[1:10:00] not not brother Elmer D but brother uh
[1:10:02] uh brother brother Jim Dalton how that
[1:10:03] he would tell the testimony you know at
[1:10:05] at the Tabernacle you have all the
[1:10:07] people that are coming through the
[1:10:08] prayer line at the Tabernacle across the
[1:10:10] platform and brother Dalton would tell
[1:10:11] this testimony of how he had his boy and
[1:10:13] his boy had a cough and you know he
[1:10:15] wanted his boy to be prayed for and as
[1:10:17] he came across the prayer line and he
[1:10:19] comes there brother Brandon pulls him
[1:10:20] aside he said now brother Ed he said you
[1:10:22] realize they sell C medicine down at the
[1:10:28] store oh brother Samuel that bothers my
[1:10:30] faith
[1:10:32] why why how can that be bothering
[1:10:36] Faith he wanted him yes he wanted his
[1:10:38] boy didn't want the cough to be no more
[1:10:40] but brother brandom is not saying that
[1:10:41] he didn't want to pray for him he prayed
[1:10:42] for him the little boy was made well but
[1:10:44] he's also helping brother Dalton to see
[1:10:47] even beyond that that there are certain
[1:10:49] things that can come along to assist God
[1:10:52] is the Healer medicine does not heal
[1:10:56] us is that right because brother B was
[1:10:59] referring to because all the definite
[1:11:01] the lot of the you know the heavy sick
[1:11:02] cases that were there now certainly I
[1:11:04] believe anybody has a cough here this
[1:11:06] morning I believe we lay hands on the
[1:11:07] sick and they shall recover so did
[1:11:09] brother Brandon believed that as well he
[1:11:11] was looking at the severity of the needs
[1:11:14] and how it was all lined up now watch
[1:11:16] this the first thing a person does when
[1:11:18] they get sick maybe around home you have
[1:11:20] a few remedies and things you try so if
[1:11:23] I don't think there's anybody here but
[1:11:25] maybe I don't know so if you're one of
[1:11:27] those people that feel like that somehow
[1:11:30] or another if you take Motrin or Tylenol
[1:11:32] or cough medicine that you've got a
[1:11:34] weakness of Faith I've just read to you
[1:11:36] a quote from the prophet of God that
[1:11:39] blows that out of the
[1:11:41] sky it's not ignoring faith is not
[1:11:46] ignoring are you hearing me David didn't
[1:11:48] walk down there and said we're going to
[1:11:50] ignore this giant how could he have
[1:11:52] ignored him and slow
[1:11:55] that's right faith is not ignoring no
[1:11:58] amen are you hearing me now now the next
[1:12:01] thing is maybe you call the doctor oh
[1:12:04] Lord have
[1:12:06] mercy that's the sensible thing to do if
[1:12:11] the doctor can't do no good then you've
[1:12:13] got a right to go to God that's what you
[1:12:17] should do call on God and God is the
[1:12:21] author of circumstance
[1:12:24] he can do when nothing else can do when
[1:12:27] man comes to the end on their line God
[1:12:30] can
[1:12:32] do aren't you glad you can say Amen to
[1:12:35] that whole
[1:12:37] quote oh praise be to God I'm glad we
[1:12:39] don't have to cherry pick quotes aren't
[1:12:42] [Laughter]
[1:12:45] you oh my now if I hurt your feelings
[1:12:48] put your feelings in way and just go on
[1:12:50] let's get let's get with it and never
[1:12:52] forget this this you people laying here
[1:12:54] sick and needy the right mental attitude
[1:12:59] toward any Divine promise of God will
[1:13:02] bring it to pass when you believe and
[1:13:05] take God at his word say it so believe
[1:13:11] it so and God will bring it to pass the
[1:13:15] right mental attitude towards any Divine
[1:13:18] promise of God will bring it to pass if
[1:13:20] you're a sinner look how simple this is
[1:13:23] if you're a sinner confess your sins
[1:13:25] believe that God saved you and then go
[1:13:28] testifying of it telling people you're
[1:13:31] saved it'll work
[1:13:34] righteousness after a while you'll be a
[1:13:40] Christian Hebrews 3 And1 Jesus Christ a
[1:13:44] high priest of our confession he is what
[1:13:47] we confess him to be and any Redemptive
[1:13:50] blessing that he died for he's sitting
[1:13:52] at the right hand of the father tonight
[1:13:54] to make good anything that you accept in
[1:13:59] him is there anything too hard for the
[1:14:02] Lord no nothing is too hard for the Lord
[1:14:06] amen now this word we think about it
[1:14:09] because this these phrasings of quote as
[1:14:11] I go through and looking at this of a
[1:14:12] right mental attitude it's to look at it
[1:14:15] correctly so we want to look at the word
[1:14:17] correctly to realize what God is saying
[1:14:20] to have the right approach even brother
[1:14:22] B says when you're com to approach the
[1:14:24] Lord don't even think you're better than
[1:14:26] somebody else or that God even owes you
[1:14:31] anything so to have the right mental
[1:14:33] attitude is to have the right
[1:14:37] approach so the attitude itself when we
[1:14:40] look at what that is that deals with a
[1:14:42] settled way of thinking or feeling about
[1:14:45] someone something typically one that is
[1:14:48] reflected in a person's Behavior that's
[1:14:52] so good so the right mental attitude
[1:14:54] will then it moves to become exhibited
[1:14:57] in our Behavior or shown Even in our
[1:15:01] Behavior this is what the prophet had
[1:15:03] just said you take God's word for
[1:15:05] healing you believe you say you're
[1:15:06] healed believe you're healed act like
[1:15:08] you're healed he said here you've repent
[1:15:11] you confessed your sins you believed
[1:15:13] you're saved then you continue to
[1:15:15] testify you're saved it will work
[1:15:17] righteousness not you will work
[1:15:19] righteousness but your confession of
[1:15:22] what he
[1:15:27] is now think of this here the Bible
[1:15:31] would say in in in third John chap 1:2
[1:15:35] beloved I wish above all things that
[1:15:38] thou mayest prosper and be in health
[1:15:41] even as thy Soul Prosper amen the
[1:15:46] message condemnation by representation
[1:15:48] brother Brandon praying saying our
[1:15:49] heavenly father we bring to you this
[1:15:51] great line of sick people God just thank
[1:15:54] many of these in here I trust that every
[1:15:57] one of them are your children born of
[1:15:59] the spirit washed in the blood filled
[1:16:01] with the Holy Ghost ready for the coming
[1:16:03] and Satan can't get to them that way to
[1:16:06] make them sin he can't get to them to
[1:16:09] make them doubt your word is wrong they
[1:16:11] go ahead and follow it just as to the
[1:16:14] letter but then he tries to come along
[1:16:17] and afflict their body because he knows
[1:16:21] that their bodies still
[1:16:23] sin but their soul is saved see that's
[1:16:27] why you never try to perfect this that
[1:16:30] that's not what you want to perfect the
[1:16:32] inside is what needs to be perfected and
[1:16:36] that Perfection that even isn't
[1:16:37] something that you have to do it's to
[1:16:40] accept what he has already made
[1:16:42] available he is our Perfection he's the
[1:16:46] one that brings that Perfection of life
[1:16:49] from out of us he's the one that gives
[1:16:51] us the strength to be able to subdue
[1:16:54] this body now think of it when he tries
[1:16:56] to come along and afflict their body
[1:16:58] because he knows that their bodies still
[1:17:00] sin but their soul is saved their bodies
[1:17:05] pardon me I forgot to put this on their
[1:17:07] bodies got to go back to the dust but
[1:17:09] their soul goes to God so he tries to
[1:17:13] afflict that part what he
[1:17:17] can what does he come to try to afflict
[1:17:20] what he can do you realize that's why
[1:17:23] even not only will he try to come to
[1:17:25] your body but even your human
[1:17:28] Spirit that's those two Realms are two
[1:17:32] Realms that are not
[1:17:34] converted but God's not interested in
[1:17:37] converting them but God sets forth his
[1:17:40] spirit in his word in that Soul quickens
[1:17:44] it and raises up a son and daughter of
[1:17:46] God like the scripture brother Brian
[1:17:48] read this morning he hath made us Kings
[1:17:51] and Priests out of the the same reality
[1:17:54] from our life we rule over sin the flesh
[1:17:57] the devil and the world and yet out of
[1:17:59] the same reality we also are priests
[1:18:03] that Worship the Lord so even when this
[1:18:06] guy is sad this guy on the inside has
[1:18:09] Joy when my spirit is weary but I'm not
[1:18:13] worshiping from my spirit or my flesh
[1:18:16] they are just simply instruments like
[1:18:19] this microphone is or like the
[1:18:21] tambourine or or these other instruments
[1:18:23] they are only instruments that allow me
[1:18:27] to express myself
[1:18:30] through oh I can already see already we
[1:18:32] need to say God help us not to allow our
[1:18:34] instruments to control Our
[1:18:39] Praise oh my oh my so he tries to
[1:18:44] afflict that part of what he can but I'm
[1:18:47] so glad that you included salvation for
[1:18:50] that body too the ear Earnest of our
[1:18:53] Resurrection the healing of our bodies
[1:18:56] and Lord on record today millions of
[1:18:59] souls millions of bodies that's healed
[1:19:02] so we know that you're
[1:19:03] God I love
[1:19:06] that 2 Corinthians 4 13 let's dive into
[1:19:11] this this scripture we pull from our
[1:19:12] text here we having the
[1:19:16] same Spirit of Faith now what's the
[1:19:19] spirit of Faith it's God's faith it's
[1:19:23] the spirit of God we having the same
[1:19:26] Spirit of Faith now what is Faith well
[1:19:29] faith is a revelation of the will of God
[1:19:31] is that right so I have I can have the
[1:19:34] revelation of the will of God which we
[1:19:36] should have what is the most important
[1:19:38] is the new birth it's the will of God
[1:19:40] for you to be born again it's the will
[1:19:42] of God for you to live for me to live
[1:19:45] victorious in this life and yet as I'm
[1:19:48] walking under that Dominion there are
[1:19:51] circumstances that can can arise attack
[1:19:54] my body things can come around that I
[1:19:57] myself do not have a direct word from at
[1:20:00] that moment but I have a word from God
[1:20:03] I've already been given by his stripes
[1:20:06] we are
[1:20:08] healed if you recall the prophet when he
[1:20:11] was speaking of that of Mark Mark 11 if
[1:20:14] you say to this mountain brother BR
[1:20:15] remember he said that is always a
[1:20:17] scripture that stumped me and he said
[1:20:19] I'd come to a spot to where I just had
[1:20:21] said that must have been prior to the
[1:20:24] atonement he said but has I begin to
[1:20:26] meditate it on on the words of that
[1:20:29] scripture in the woods that day he said
[1:20:31] the spirit of God begins to move upon my
[1:20:34] heart and I said well when they you know
[1:20:36] that that was just something kind of
[1:20:37] like what the prophets used to do and he
[1:20:40] said right then there was an anointing
[1:20:42] that came and that word struck me on
[1:20:44] what the prophets used to do what did
[1:20:47] the prophets do they did not speak
[1:20:49] according to their own thinking they did
[1:20:52] not we things it wasn't Isaiah saying
[1:20:54] how let me let me see how wonderful this
[1:20:56] could be here let me just say uh Behold
[1:20:58] a virgin shall conceive no as a matter
[1:21:00] of fact if God would have let Isaiah
[1:21:03] know a forehand he probably would never
[1:21:06] have said it but it is a moment of a
[1:21:09] word of God that drops down sovereignly
[1:21:13] you don't pray it down I don't pray it
[1:21:15] down it is sovereignly given by almighty
[1:21:19] God now I'm not going to preach on that
[1:21:21] this morning but it sets a little
[1:21:23] background here on that spirit that same
[1:21:26] Spirit of Faith you you already have it
[1:21:28] it's like many times where individuals
[1:21:30] will say well I wish I had Faith well
[1:21:32] listen you do have faith even without
[1:21:35] the spirit of God in a person's life you
[1:21:37] still begin with mental
[1:21:39] faith is that right still taking the
[1:21:42] word in that's what the prophet was
[1:21:43] talking about with taking that word and
[1:21:46] confessing it and then watch he said it
[1:21:48] will work righteousness it moves from
[1:21:50] just something that's mental to a real
[1:21:53] Supernatural Faith but yet in our lives
[1:21:56] of how that we walk in this present life
[1:21:59] to understand that we have faith
[1:22:01] remember the the uh the the little
[1:22:02] sister the stad cliff sister when she
[1:22:04] was troubled I've quoted this probably a
[1:22:06] hundred times from this pull pit but
[1:22:08] that little sister was so troubled when
[1:22:10] her baby when God said don't touch it to
[1:22:12] the prophet it's the hand of the Lord
[1:22:15] now you know when when she she was
[1:22:17] troubled like maybe you or I would be
[1:22:19] troubled with something and even the
[1:22:21] question that we could even think about
[1:22:23] in our life was this baby taken because
[1:22:26] I didn't have enough faith and brother
[1:22:29] bam turns around he says oh no sister St
[1:22:31] cff you have great faith I'm glad it was
[1:22:35] said like that he just didn't say you
[1:22:37] had Faith but you had great faith
[1:22:40] because when God decided to take your
[1:22:42] baby yet you are still standing
[1:22:46] steadfast and serving
[1:22:48] him that's great faith so great faith
[1:22:52] now listen if great faith is only
[1:22:55] measured by if we can walk out of the
[1:22:57] Lion's Den walk out away from The Sword
[1:23:01] then you've got to exclude some in
[1:23:02] Hebrews 11 cuz not all of them in
[1:23:04] Hebrews 11 walked out of the Lion's Den
[1:23:07] some of them said they were also
[1:23:09] tortured to
[1:23:11] death oh brother Samuel that's a downer
[1:23:13] shouldn't be a downer it was God God
[1:23:15] they were serving the purpose and the
[1:23:17] will of almighty God see friends we do
[1:23:21] not want to create our own well this is
[1:23:23] how it's going to be that's not you
[1:23:25] God's not asked you to create your own
[1:23:26] world and try to step into it he's
[1:23:28] already created a place that you and I
[1:23:31] can step into as a matter of fact there
[1:23:34] for a vision to break before us of a
[1:23:37] perfectly whole person and the prophet
[1:23:39] said you see yourself there and walk
[1:23:42] step by step by step until you become
[1:23:45] that
[1:23:46] person might be a lot of things along
[1:23:48] the road right might be a lot of things
[1:23:50] that that person will have to go through
[1:23:52] maybe they'll have to go through test
[1:23:54] maybe they'll have to go through
[1:23:55] confessing after after time and time
[1:23:57] again might be a lot of medicine they'll
[1:23:59] have to take might be different things
[1:24:01] they'll have to do but you know what
[1:24:02] it's not one spec less of a mighty
[1:24:05] Miracle by a mighty God that's
[1:24:10] right oh Hallelujah we having the same
[1:24:13] Spirit of Faith according as it is
[1:24:15] written I believed and therefore have I
[1:24:17] spoken we also
[1:24:20] believe and therefore
[1:24:23] speak knowing having this assurance that
[1:24:26] he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall
[1:24:29] raise up us also by Jesus and shall
[1:24:33] present us with you so we have an
[1:24:36] assurance God is going to deliver us
[1:24:41] from the
[1:24:42] circumstance I've got an assurance on
[1:24:45] that I'm speaking Paul can you tell us
[1:24:47] how I don't know how can you tell us
[1:24:48] what's going to come I don't know what's
[1:24:50] going to come next but I know that as he
[1:24:52] has raised us up already we who were
[1:24:56] dead in sin and trespasses I don't know
[1:24:59] how he's going to do it I don't know
[1:25:00] what he's going to do I don't need to
[1:25:02] know the plan I just know The God Who
[1:25:06] holds my life In His
[1:25:08] Hands that's my
[1:25:16] Assurance that's why it's so important
[1:25:18] in us taking in the word of
[1:25:21] God brother BR says see he comes back to
[1:25:24] that throughout the message remember we
[1:25:27] what I read to you in the opening quote
[1:25:28] of about that a positive thinking we're
[1:25:31] not against positive thinking but
[1:25:34] positive thinking you must think on
[1:25:35] positive things brother B says positive
[1:25:38] faith comes from positive a positive
[1:25:40] Source there's only one positive Source
[1:25:44] not my idea your idea but
[1:25:47] God's right this is this is our positive
[1:25:49] Source this is the word of God where we
[1:25:52] draw our strength from now think about
[1:25:55] it our word the word of God brother R
[1:25:57] would would put it so simple in our
[1:25:59] lives he would say that sometimes
[1:26:00] there's things that you know he said
[1:26:02] maybe he said we're standing in here and
[1:26:04] we've got doubt in here and the doubt
[1:26:06] that we have in here he says and yet
[1:26:08] we're trying to reach out and take a
[1:26:09] hold of a promise we can't do it that
[1:26:11] way you know friends listen this is one
[1:26:13] thing that I am so thankful for more and
[1:26:16] more over the years as I've studied the
[1:26:18] message and look at it that the message
[1:26:20] ain't like putting uh I on a messed up
[1:26:23] cake you saying what do you mean by that
[1:26:26] we're not putting icing over man's
[1:26:29] theology but God has went to the very
[1:26:33] root of it I don't care what kind of
[1:26:36] icing you put on it you could have I
[1:26:38] love buttercream icing Lord have mercy I
[1:26:41] love that stuff you could put that on
[1:26:43] the you could put that on maybe a cake
[1:26:45] that's eaten with mold and everything
[1:26:46] else you've ruined the
[1:26:51] frosting God not what this message did
[1:26:54] are you hearing me now neither it it
[1:26:57] showed us the pattern neither does God
[1:27:01] just come and smear things over on our
[1:27:03] lives that's why the new birth is not a
[1:27:06] Reformation not a smear over on the
[1:27:09] outside the new birth begins on the
[1:27:14] inside is that right that's where real
[1:27:18] healing takes place is on the inside and
[1:27:21] he works to the outside so when we can
[1:27:24] receive the word of God that's the only
[1:27:26] thing that has life in it now what
[1:27:29] catches the word it has our spirit
[1:27:31] catches the word it comes into our mind
[1:27:35] but it's not our mind that has the power
[1:27:38] it's the word that has the transforming
[1:27:41] power in it and we can let that word as
[1:27:44] the prophet tells us let that word drop
[1:27:47] all the way on down and then it'll clean
[1:27:50] out anything that needs to be cleaned
[1:27:54] out that's my
[1:27:56] desire that's my desire because we we
[1:27:59] don't get answers any other way so to
[1:28:02] think about this without maybe dwelling
[1:28:04] on that so much here this morning but I
[1:28:07] want to just this is a quote here that
[1:28:09] I've sent this a lot of times to many
[1:28:10] different brothers and different ones
[1:28:12] that been dealing with different things
[1:28:13] even in overseas and other places too
[1:28:16] but I I this came to me as I was praying
[1:28:18] I didn't have this down but yesterday
[1:28:20] morning as I was just praying and
[1:28:21] looking to to the Lord Lord what would
[1:28:23] you have me to say and as I begin to
[1:28:25] look over it he brought this quote back
[1:28:27] to me and I want to read it to you
[1:28:28] brother B says let us pray and know and
[1:28:31] lay hands on you anointing you with oil
[1:28:34] and watch what God will do no matter
[1:28:38] what the
[1:28:40] circumstances Jesus said in mark 11:24
[1:28:44] he said if Thou shalt say to this
[1:28:45] mountain be plucked up and cast into the
[1:28:48] sea and don't doubt in your heart but
[1:28:50] believe that what you say shall come to
[1:28:53] pass Thou shalt have what you say now
[1:28:57] brother said let me quote the Lexicon on
[1:28:58] that the original Greek here's the way
[1:29:00] it reads if Thou shalt say to this
[1:29:03] mountain be ye lifted up and thrown into
[1:29:07] the sea and don't doubt in your heart
[1:29:10] but believe that what you have said is
[1:29:13] coming to pass you can have what you say
[1:29:18] Amen that phrase is a huge phrase
[1:29:22] amen but this time you mean us to move
[1:29:24] mountains we have been restored back to
[1:29:27] where Adam fell from as Sons and
[1:29:30] Daughters of God and let me just say
[1:29:32] this to you it's not the physical
[1:29:34] mountains that I am bothered with it's
[1:29:37] not physical mountains you're bothered
[1:29:39] with are you hearing me now it is not
[1:29:41] physical storm so much that you're
[1:29:44] bothered with although God may have
[1:29:46] dropped inspiration on your heart for a
[1:29:48] need or or something that has come about
[1:29:50] in your life but then when when I look
[1:29:52] at the prophet speaking at that
[1:29:54] snowstorm to me it was not God letting
[1:29:57] me know Samuel this is what I want you
[1:30:00] to consecrate yourself for is be ready
[1:30:03] when snow storms God knew he'd be
[1:30:05] picking the wrong guy cuz I love
[1:30:08] snow but what was God
[1:30:10] saying that there will be storms come in
[1:30:13] your life that the forecast says you
[1:30:17] better get out of here quick that the
[1:30:19] forecast says this is going to happen I
[1:30:22] see the events woo it's getting cold in
[1:30:24] here now oh the wind is blowing there
[1:30:26] are storms that want to arise in your
[1:30:30] life and God took a prophet to show you
[1:30:34] and I what the rest of the
[1:30:36] crop Sons and Daughters of God and where
[1:30:39] God would bring you and I to is that
[1:30:42] right there's storms in our life there's
[1:30:45] things that come up in our
[1:30:48] life think about this is to me this is a
[1:30:51] v some of the this is such a powerful
[1:30:53] statement right here that brother R
[1:30:54] makes in this quote don't doubt in your
[1:30:56] heart but believe that what you've said
[1:30:59] is coming to pass hallelujah it's in
[1:31:03] that time frame right there is when the
[1:31:06] devil wants to
[1:31:08] work when the second miracle that was
[1:31:10] done in
[1:31:11] Canaan there was another man not the
[1:31:14] Roman centurium but a different man
[1:31:16] accounted in the Book of John he wants
[1:31:19] the Lord Jesus to come to his house this
[1:31:21] man wants him to come to his house and
[1:31:23] the Lord Jesus said I I you know I I can
[1:31:25] I'm not able he said but let me just
[1:31:27] let's just let's just send the word and
[1:31:29] the man retakes that and receives the
[1:31:32] word so it doesn't come the way he's
[1:31:35] asking for it he wants Jesus to come to
[1:31:37] his house but Jesus is unable physically
[1:31:42] to get there but he says I'm going to
[1:31:44] send my word because that's who I am
[1:31:48] Hallelujah and the Bible says that as
[1:31:50] the man went went on he believed and
[1:31:54] those in his house come running when as
[1:31:56] he got near home and he asked them what
[1:32:00] hour did he begin to
[1:32:04] amend
[1:32:07] amend meaning turning for the better he
[1:32:12] didn't ask him what hour did he get up
[1:32:14] and go out to the garden and start
[1:32:15] gardening no what hour did he amend
[1:32:18] that's why the prophet said if you can
[1:32:20] only move your finger think you move
[1:32:23] it then once you move this then you move
[1:32:26] another one then you move another one
[1:32:29] then you move another one then you keep
[1:32:31] going is that right oh but Lord have
[1:32:35] mercy if it don't all happen at once I I
[1:32:37] didn't get nothing that ain't the word
[1:32:39] of
[1:32:41] God sometimes friends what's happened is
[1:32:43] as we get defeated in our own
[1:32:47] thoughts that we have interpreted or
[1:32:50] placed and then then the enemy wants to
[1:32:53] come around and said see God don't keep
[1:32:54] his word I'm telling you right now God
[1:32:57] keeps his word there's been things I'll
[1:33:00] just be honest there's been things that
[1:33:01] didn't happen the way I thought it was
[1:33:02] going to
[1:33:04] happen but you know what God fulfilled
[1:33:07] his
[1:33:08] word hallelujah Benjamin had a had a
[1:33:11] growth right there many of you remember
[1:33:12] it as a as just a real real little baby
[1:33:14] had a growth we went through prayer line
[1:33:16] after prayer
[1:33:18] line that's right nothing wrong with a
[1:33:21] prayer line to me I I go I would have
[1:33:23] went through another
[1:33:24] one well but the same it must have been
[1:33:26] your faith wasn't right well you know
[1:33:28] you you question that you look at it
[1:33:30] because we we read you know you know how
[1:33:32] it is we can read in the word of God and
[1:33:34] then Satan has a way of trying to get in
[1:33:36] there and what what's he trying to do he
[1:33:38] wants to isolate
[1:33:40] you as though you're some strange odd
[1:33:43] bird and it's something weird why it
[1:33:45] ain't happening to you and he'll lead
[1:33:48] you out to this one little little
[1:33:50] private little little secluded spot and
[1:33:53] then want to drop it on you you must not
[1:33:55] be a
[1:33:58] believer all right let's pin him
[1:34:04] in I'll never forget the one night we
[1:34:06] were sitting back there my dad was
[1:34:08] ministering we had already went over to
[1:34:10] the Cleveland Clinic cuz they were going
[1:34:11] to do a surgery and remove that remove
[1:34:13] that that tumor that growth they were
[1:34:15] going to remove it right there doctor
[1:34:17] had got up they had to put him asleep
[1:34:19] cuz he was such a little guy they had to
[1:34:20] put him asleep so they could do the
[1:34:21] x-rays and things and here you have your
[1:34:23] little lifeless honey how old was
[1:34:26] he two two years old so here he was and
[1:34:30] I remember just sitting there in that
[1:34:31] little room where they have you waiting
[1:34:33] my knees were touching to bed and I'm
[1:34:34] looking at him there and I'm praying I'm
[1:34:36] looking to the Lord and the Lord I'll
[1:34:38] never forget where the Lord spoke to my
[1:34:39] heart and he just spoke to me simply
[1:34:41] like this he said it he said in this
[1:34:43] manner he said you know it's as great a
[1:34:46] miracle even if it comes through this
[1:34:49] way it's still me
[1:34:53] that never has ever left me Hall that's
[1:34:57] good because all healing comes from God
[1:35:01] now that's what the prophet has told us
[1:35:02] and we see it in the scripture right
[1:35:06] amen even haki used figs maybe that
[1:35:09] would have been the essential oils of
[1:35:10] that
[1:35:12] day even Hezekiah used figs is that
[1:35:16] right but all healing comes from God but
[1:35:18] I never forget when Dad was preaching in
[1:35:20] here my wife we were sitting there and
[1:35:22] my wife said you know she said honey she
[1:35:24] said uh she said why don't we go ahead
[1:35:26] you know cuz scheduled surgery was
[1:35:27] scheduled they had done all that prep
[1:35:28] work did a X-rays and stuff like that so
[1:35:30] why don't we go ahead and have him
[1:35:31] prayed for and I looked there I
[1:35:33] said okay okay I had thought about it I
[1:35:36] said okay let's let's go ahead so I walk
[1:35:38] up here I'm standing right here was
[1:35:40] right here and the deacons had come
[1:35:41] around at that time and I'm standing
[1:35:43] right here and my dad begins to pray and
[1:35:46] out of my
[1:35:48] mouth I'm not praying God to help him
[1:35:51] through the surgery but what came out of
[1:35:53] my mouth was thanking God for his
[1:35:58] healing I didn't make that happen I
[1:36:02] didn't will that to happen in my heart I
[1:36:05] was already accepted no less of Faith
[1:36:10] this must be the Avenue Lord you want us
[1:36:11] to go Hallelujah
[1:36:14] hallu but sitting at the dinner table
[1:36:17] there I think a week later I looked over
[1:36:19] at the dinner table I said honey
[1:36:21] I said that that thing's going down
[1:36:23] ain't it look at I think it's going down
[1:36:25] she stopped she turned around she said
[1:36:28] it is it's going down I said praise the
[1:36:30] lord well his surgery you know was still
[1:36:33] like a week or a couple weeks out from
[1:36:35] that right there and here we we contined
[1:36:37] to look at it that thing went down to
[1:36:39] where it completely was gone from his
[1:36:41] body
[1:36:44] hallu what was that sovereignly given by
[1:36:49] God it was brother Samuel's nothing it's
[1:36:53] God sovereignly dropping down and giving
[1:36:56] a word it wasn't brother Samuel standing
[1:36:59] here and saying I don't want my boy to
[1:37:01] go through a surgery Lord you come down
[1:37:03] and heal him NOP that would have been
[1:37:05] the wrong
[1:37:06] approach Lord we don't have time to go
[1:37:08] through a surgery
[1:37:13] sorry I understand how pressures and
[1:37:16] things feel but I don't really think
[1:37:18] anybody has any time to go through
[1:37:20] anything right I don't think anybody has
[1:37:22] any time I don't think anybody says hey
[1:37:23] you know what I got time for a surgery
[1:37:25] this coming month I don't think anybody
[1:37:27] say thinks that but you see it's careful
[1:37:30] on our
[1:37:32] approach to the word of
[1:37:34] God oh my when you say to this mountain
[1:37:39] be moved and it stands there well it
[1:37:42] didn't
[1:37:45] happen oh it did happen oh I love that
[1:37:49] when you said mountain move may be one
[1:37:52] little significant grain of sand turned
[1:37:55] loose out of the hundreds of billions
[1:37:58] and billions of tons one little grain
[1:38:01] moved but it's begin to take place hold
[1:38:05] that faith and watch that
[1:38:08] mountain
[1:38:10] [Applause]
[1:38:13] disappear now I love this part of the
[1:38:16] quote here Thou shalt say in thine heart
[1:38:20] disease
[1:38:21] move from my child disease move from my
[1:38:26] body in the name of the Lord Jesus and
[1:38:28] don't doubt right there the good germs
[1:38:32] take on a new armor and a new weapon and
[1:38:35] the enemy begins to back
[1:38:44] up oh the enemy ain't run no he just
[1:38:46] backing up but let's keep him backing up
[1:38:49] that's right amen
[1:38:53] he is defeated because Christ in the
[1:38:55] drinking of his myrr at Calvary defeated
[1:38:57] the devil and every one of his powers
[1:38:59] and he stripped him of everything he had
[1:39:02] and he's nothing but a bluff and he can
[1:39:04] go through with it if he can he'll do
[1:39:07] it Hallelujah Hebrews 4:14 everybody all
[1:39:10] right seeing then seeing then that we
[1:39:14] have a great high priest that is passed
[1:39:16] into the heavens Jesus the son of God do
[1:39:19] you understand what that means he's Rose
[1:39:22] above every principality not did he not
[1:39:25] only did he conquer the underworld he
[1:39:28] has conquered both invisible and visible
[1:39:33] Realms he has ascended above it
[1:39:36] all Hallelujah that's why Paul could say
[1:39:40] we're persecuted but looking above that
[1:39:43] I'm not
[1:39:45] forsaken cast down but I'm not forgotten
[1:39:49] am see
[1:39:52] then that we have a great high priest
[1:39:54] that is passed into the heavens Jesus
[1:39:56] the son of God let us hold fast our
[1:40:01] profession it means to take a hold of it
[1:40:03] to seize it not to discard it but to
[1:40:06] keep it
[1:40:07] carefully and
[1:40:10] Faithfully Hebrews
[1:40:13] 1023 how how do I keep that carefully
[1:40:16] and Faithfully even watching amen where
[1:40:20] you would go with it
[1:40:21] now I don't think I
[1:40:24] mean I don't think any sister that has
[1:40:26] white shoes on would have like a white
[1:40:28] dress and everything else I don't think
[1:40:30] they're going to be wanting to walk back
[1:40:31] through those
[1:40:34] woods I don't think so cuz I can tell
[1:40:37] you right now as soon as you get off
[1:40:38] that sidewalk back there right beyond
[1:40:40] that fire fire pit a little bit you go
[1:40:42] to
[1:40:44] sinking you want waiters you want good
[1:40:46] hunting boots on when you go back there
[1:40:48] ain't that right brother Joey H it's
[1:40:50] it's water back
[1:40:52] there that's no joke but it's what are
[1:40:55] you saying that you wouldn't take what
[1:40:57] God has given you which is greater than
[1:41:00] any outfit of white a word that God
[1:41:03] would give you in this service and then
[1:41:06] take it and just get around the wrong
[1:41:09] company and allow the things to start to
[1:41:13] take it right out of
[1:41:15] you you've got to guard what God gives
[1:41:17] you guard it a word from the Lord guard
[1:41:21] it Mary heard what the shepherd said and
[1:41:24] the Bible said she
[1:41:26] pondered she kept those things in her
[1:41:31] heart Hebrews 10:23 let us hold fast the
[1:41:35] profession of our faith without wavering
[1:41:40] amen for he this is why this is how this

[1:42:44] by a word from the
[1:42:47] Lord oh they're just working themselves
[1:42:50] up that's just nothing but fanaticism
[1:42:53] there is a whole banquet of quotes that
[1:42:55] I could quote and keep you here for days
[1:42:58] and you know this as Believers you
[1:42:59] listen to it on the tape I hope you
[1:43:01] don't turn the tape over after brother
[1:43:03] brandom finishes preaching because it's
[1:43:05] just getting it it's moving in even
[1:43:06] deeper and there's a lot of nuggets that
[1:43:09] are dropped in there along the way a lot
[1:43:12] of real good counsel that's dropped into
[1:43:15] those moments now notice what he's doing
[1:43:17] he's instructing this lady I want you to
[1:43:20] think about it he's not saying when when
[1:43:22] he's looking at it he's not saying that
[1:43:25] if lady if you go from here and you
[1:43:27] continue to take your medicine if you
[1:43:29] going and do that you're being negative
[1:43:31] that's not what he's saying he's not
[1:43:33] saying if you go from here and the next
[1:43:35] day when you wake up you say my I got a
[1:43:37] little pain in my back that's not being
[1:43:39] negative but what you do after that and
[1:43:41] say but by his stripes I am
[1:43:45] healed Hallelujah I might feel a little
[1:43:48] bad right back here but right here I
[1:43:50] tell you what I buy his straps I'm
[1:43:52] Healed what is it I'm not having a
[1:43:55] negative testimony I see the Giants I'm
[1:43:58] not saying there ain't no Giants there
[1:44:00] but I'm saying if God be for us who can
[1:44:04] be against
[1:44:06] us hallelujah
[1:44:11] hallelujah that's why sister d a lot of
[1:44:14] you know brother and sister D you you
[1:44:15] heard it on tape you remember that they
[1:44:17] own Brown Supply down there in Lima some
[1:44:19] of the brothers brother and them retired
[1:44:21] from their Brown Supply in those places
[1:44:23] down there that brother Dow you'll hear
[1:44:25] Brother Ram talk about him on tape and
[1:44:27] you remember that sister da came through
[1:44:28] the line and she began to get real sick
[1:44:30] after going to one of the meetings there
[1:44:32] at the Tabernacle they were always
[1:44:33] around where brother Brown was at and
[1:44:35] she got real sick and all of a sudden
[1:44:37] brother Brown he saw he saw her getting
[1:44:40] real sick and brother Tom called up
[1:44:41] brother Brown he said brother Bram he
[1:44:42] said Mama's getting awful bad she's
[1:44:44] getting over sick and brother B said
[1:44:45] hold on he said hold on minut wait a
[1:44:47] minute he said just wait a minute he
[1:44:49] said um he said brother Tommy said ask
[1:44:51] your mom if she stopped taking her
[1:44:52] medicine so brother Tom L said mom he
[1:44:55] said Mama he said did you stop taking
[1:44:56] your medicine she said well yeah she
[1:44:58] said I came across the platform and and
[1:45:00] the Lord spoke through the prophet and
[1:45:02] said I'm Healed brother Bram said you
[1:45:04] tell her not to stop taking that
[1:45:06] medicine but in time her body will bear
[1:45:09] the testimony of it aren't you glad for
[1:45:12] that
[1:45:12] witness oh I I know these things maybe
[1:45:15] aren't WR but I appreciate them
[1:45:17] testimonies and that part of balance you
[1:45:19] say why do you appreciate that because I
[1:45:21] know how the devil wants to try to wear
[1:45:23] out God's people and wants to tell you
[1:45:26] you don't have faith or this or that or
[1:45:29] the other but God said you
[1:45:32] [Applause]
[1:45:38] do all right dive into another one he
[1:45:42] said now he says you look at your
[1:45:44] symptom and you look at your Sy you say
[1:45:46] well look here I was prayed for for a
[1:45:49] crippled hand my hand ain't ain't no
[1:45:50] better that's no sign you're not healed
[1:45:54] that's right God said so that's it no
[1:45:57] matter what that hand takes place it's
[1:46:00] what God said yes so my hand still
[1:46:03] crippled but that that that doesn't take
[1:46:05] preeminence over what God Said what God
[1:46:09] Said is What I believe and it's going to
[1:46:11] bring this in
[1:46:14] line hallelujah it's what he said it
[1:46:17] ain't from my hand it's what God Said I
[1:46:19] accepted it and I'll stay with it that's
[1:46:22] all he could open up it can open up
[1:46:24] today tomorrow might be 25 years let
[1:46:27] your testimony be
[1:46:31] positive you know funny thing about it
[1:46:33] is brother Brown would refer to Abraham
[1:46:34] and he preached on Abraham's life all
[1:46:36] the way through the message and yet when
[1:46:38] people begin to testify positive you get
[1:46:40] classified as a
[1:46:42] cook the mess all the way through the
[1:46:45] message oh but brother Samuel Abraham
[1:46:48] had a word from God he didn't know how
[1:46:51] and all the points of how it was going
[1:46:53] to come but he took one word and walked
[1:46:56] with that word just like you as a child
[1:46:59] of Abraham by his stripes I'm Healed
[1:47:03] when the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is
[1:47:05] mine you take a promise of God with a
[1:47:07] right mental attitude toward it and you
[1:47:09] walk as a child of
[1:47:12] Abraham so when Abraham went and paid
[1:47:14] the bill remember what the prophet said
[1:47:16] when they went to the hospital
[1:47:18] dramatizing it what did Abraham and
[1:47:20] Sarah what were they called
[1:47:24] CS
[1:47:26] nuts this old couple yeah father of
[1:47:30] Nations how's it
[1:47:32] coming how's it going for you
[1:47:36] all how's the registry coming over at
[1:47:40] uh doubts are
[1:47:45] us that's
[1:47:49] good watch this the friends these are
[1:47:51] simple words but I pray God help us
[1:47:54] there there's a reason God would bring
[1:47:56] this to us and give us Direction in this
[1:47:58] hour every time you get sick when you're
[1:48:00] prayed for and you go out and get a
[1:48:02] little sick and you say well I guess I
[1:48:04] lost my healing then your testimony
[1:48:08] becomes negative and Jesus can't say no
[1:48:12] more for
[1:48:14] you now you hear what he's saying he's
[1:48:16] not saying that you don't say well you
[1:48:18] know what my that pain in my back is
[1:48:20] still there but he's My Healer not that
[1:48:22] pain in my back I must not got healed I
[1:48:24] must not got a touch from God and then
[1:48:26] you know what it didn't work no that's
[1:48:29] when your testimony becomes
[1:48:34] negative he's the high priest of your
[1:48:36] confession sitting there making
[1:48:38] intercessions on your confession what
[1:48:40] you
[1:48:42] believe Brianna go to paragraph 39
[1:48:44] please you've got to have your testimony
[1:48:47] and your confession positive
[1:48:50] not according to my feelings but
[1:48:54] according to what he
[1:48:58] said I tell you it's easier to read
[1:49:02] it it's easier to sit here and say Amen
[1:49:04] to
[1:49:05] it but you know what this is this is
[1:49:07] equipping you and reminding you of what
[1:49:09] armor you
[1:49:11] haveall that your feelings are not
[1:49:15] you feelings are things that are real
[1:49:18] that's around you but there's a greater
[1:49:19] reality amen hallelujah those feelings
[1:49:23] are just
[1:49:27] temporal that which is eternal is right
[1:49:30] there as well you got a choice on what
[1:49:33] you're going to look
[1:49:34] at is that right now notice this I I
[1:49:38] love this quote too everybody all right
[1:49:41] now healing is not something that you
[1:49:43] just say well yeah I believe it I
[1:49:46] believe it now that's all right if
[1:49:48] that's the best you can do just mentally
[1:49:50] or just say well yes I I see it I
[1:49:52] believe it I accept it I love this you
[1:49:54] see you see God's desire to make a way
[1:49:57] yeah everybody hearing what I'm saying
[1:50:00] like God did in the Old Testament he
[1:50:01] said if you can't bring a lamb bring a
[1:50:03] turtle dove God's interested I want you
[1:50:06] to get what you need so I provided so if
[1:50:10] a person brother Ram says if that's the
[1:50:12] best that you can do just mentally he
[1:50:15] never said don't do anything at all he
[1:50:18] never said that he said if that's the
[1:50:20] best that you can do just mentally or
[1:50:22] just say well I see it I believe it I
[1:50:24] accept it then if you accept it on those
[1:50:27] basis keep saying it over and over say
[1:50:32] it out loud say it over and over just
[1:50:35] keep saying it I'm Healed I'm Healed say
[1:50:38] it until you actually believe it and
[1:50:41] when you believe it then it's going to
[1:50:43] take
[1:50:44] place boo

[1:51:15] promises that Belong To Me Oh They'll
[1:51:19] shuffle through they'll Loop they'll
[1:51:21] repeat over and over and over and over
[1:51:25] and a matter of fact I might put a
[1:51:27] little step to it might put a little
[1:51:29] dance to it I'm
[1:51:30] [Applause]
[1:51:35] Healed oh brother Samuel that's just
[1:51:38] emotional workup maybe for you it
[1:51:43] is but I've see people get excited and
[1:51:46] expressive at things that absolutely
[1:51:48] have no life
[1:51:50] and would criticize the moving of
[1:51:57] God can I read the rest of the testimony
[1:52:01] or the
[1:52:01] quote don't have a negative
[1:52:05] testimony every time you confess well I
[1:52:09] still feel bad today now watch that's
[1:52:12] not the negative part it's this next
[1:52:15] little clip I
[1:52:18] guess I you you could finish that so if
[1:52:22] you well I I you know how are you
[1:52:24] feeling well I still feel bad but he's
[1:52:28] my
[1:52:29] healer what are you going to do I'm just
[1:52:31] going to set him right out in the edge
[1:52:32] of my tent and I'm going to watch for
[1:52:35] him I still I maybe still have the pain
[1:52:38] but you know what I'm going to watch for
[1:52:39] him cuz by his stripes I'm
[1:52:43] Healed see it's when we put the next
[1:52:46] part on there well I still have I still
[1:52:48] feel bad I guess
[1:52:52] you go right straight back in the same
[1:52:53] rut you was in the beginning there's not
[1:52:55] a man or woman in here that is baptized
[1:52:57] with a holy spirit but what would start
[1:52:59] your confession I believe I've lost the
[1:53:02] Holy Spirit I believe it's gone from me
[1:53:05] you'll go right
[1:53:07] down listen he says you'll never live
[1:53:10] above your confession Jesus is the high
[1:53:13] priest of our confession he said any
[1:53:16] scholar knows profession is confession
[1:53:18] too now sitting at the right hand of the
[1:53:21] father to make intercessions upon what
[1:53:23] our confession he can't do nothing for
[1:53:26] you until first you confess he's done
[1:53:33] it I want you to watch as as I'm going
[1:53:36] through these quotes you understand why
[1:53:38] even today purposely I haven't dealt
[1:53:40] with that of Mark of Mark 11 injectivity
[1:53:43] how the Lord has brought it here and
[1:53:44] there but this is not talking about when
[1:53:46] a word is dropped down such as as just
[1:53:50] speak the word when squirrels were
[1:53:52] spoken to existence that's sovereignly
[1:53:54] given but this right here is an access
[1:53:57] to the promises that we have and we take
[1:54:00] those
[1:54:02] promises and we look to the Lord if God
[1:54:05] gives us a direct word so be it but
[1:54:08] either way God's going to keep his word
[1:54:11] because any direct word he's going to
[1:54:13] give will never take away from the word
[1:54:17] he's already given hallah is that right
[1:54:21] it's like we talked about on Thursday we
[1:54:22] do general orders until specific orders
[1:54:25] come when you accepted now watch this
[1:54:28] this is how simple it is I love this now
[1:54:31] he says now I'm not saved tonight
[1:54:34] because I get happy and Shout that isn't
[1:54:37] it I'm not H I'm not saved because the
[1:54:40] gift of God works through me I'm saved
[1:54:43] because I have met the conditions that
[1:54:46] Jesus Christ required from me I'm saved
[1:54:49] according to the Bible not because I
[1:54:52] feel like I'm saved right I don't know
[1:54:56] about you sometimes my feelings are not
[1:55:04] there feelings but you this this is
[1:55:07] where we learn to live not by our
[1:55:09] feelings don't get me wrong I like
[1:55:12] feelings oh brother Samuel I don't ah
[1:55:14] you're
[1:55:17] lying I love to feel the presence of God
[1:55:20] I love I love that feeling on a mountain
[1:55:22] top I don't like feelings in the
[1:55:25] valley I I just don't like them but you
[1:55:28] know what I've learned that the valley
[1:55:30] does not have to dictate or allow my
[1:55:32] feelings to control my
[1:55:37] life sometimes it's things that we have
[1:55:39] to press beyond what we don't feel like
[1:55:42] do the opposite of what you don't feel
[1:55:45] like well I don't feel like going to
[1:55:48] church press beyond that because you
[1:55:51] sure didn't get that thought from
[1:55:53] God I mean God didn't tell you you just
[1:55:56] stay home tonight rest in your recliner
[1:55:58] God didn't tell you that how could he do
[1:56:00] that he's speaking contrary to his
[1:56:03] word are you hearing me church sometimes
[1:56:06] we just have feelings well you know I
[1:56:08] feel and I feel but look at this I'm not
[1:56:10] saved because I feel like I'm saved
[1:56:13] Satan can whip you around the stump on
[1:56:16] your feelings but he can't when it's
[1:56:18] thus sayith Lord he can't wait across
[1:56:21] that that'll defeat him now he says when
[1:56:24] you believe you were saved sitting in
[1:56:26] your seat wherever you was you accepted
[1:56:28] it and begin to confess and tell people
[1:56:31] you were saved you kept on saying I'm
[1:56:35] saved the people said watch this there
[1:56:38] ain't no difference in you but you
[1:56:40] believe there was and you kept with your
[1:56:42] confession and after a while it worked
[1:56:46] righteousness all your neighbors
[1:56:48] everybody knows you're saved now because
[1:56:51] you believed it you confessed it what
[1:56:53] happened what changed you he's the high
[1:56:55] priest of your confession setting at the
[1:56:58] right hand of the father making good on
[1:57:00] what you're
[1:57:03] confessing Lord I'm just no good he just
[1:57:06] sits
[1:57:08] there well what are you doing I can't
[1:57:10] intercede on that cuz that's not my
[1:57:13] thoughts that that's not my thoughts
[1:57:15] concerning you
[1:57:17] right well Lord I I don't I don't think
[1:57:19] I'll ever get
[1:57:21] healed he just sits why that's not his
[1:57:24] word he's already given his word
[1:57:27] concerning you and he ain't going to
[1:57:29] change his
[1:57:32] mind Glory blessed be the name of the
[1:57:35] Lord I feel like
[1:57:38] running
[1:57:39] Hallelujah now watch this he said it's
[1:57:41] the same thing about healing so listen
[1:57:43] if you're sitting here this morning and
[1:57:45] you're in need of Salvation take what
[1:57:47] has just been read to you quote after
[1:57:49] quote I could give you many more it
[1:57:50] starts with you taking the word and
[1:57:53] beginning to confess it you say but
[1:57:55] brother Samuel I still got this sin in
[1:57:57] my life I've still got that quit looking
[1:57:59] at your
[1:58:00] symptoms they are lying
[1:58:04] vanities look at the word of
[1:58:06] [Applause]
[1:58:09] God brush the seaweed back get it out of
[1:58:12] your mouth and keep on saying he is my
[1:58:15] savior he is my redeemer he has saved me
[1:58:19] he is my deliverer he's my chain
[1:58:23] breaker Hallelujah let the redeemed of
[1:58:27] the Lord say
[1:58:28] [Applause]
[1:58:35] so the
[1:58:36] Lord that's the same thing it is by
[1:58:39] healing you accept him as your healer
[1:58:42] renounce your
[1:58:48] feelings what's that mean renounce your
[1:58:50] feelings it means if your feelings was
[1:58:52] sitting beside you right there you say
[1:58:55] no longer I ain't saving this seat for
[1:58:57] you you know what I'm saying you know
[1:58:58] how your buddies wanting lunch you know
[1:59:01] you put your milk over here put this
[1:59:04] over here and you save your seats what
[1:59:06] you need to do is when symptoms feelings
[1:59:08] want to say can I sit beside you nope no
[1:59:11] room for you
[1:59:14] here no room for feelings
[1:59:18] here healer renounce your Fe healer
[1:59:22] always says accept him as your healer
[1:59:23] renounce your feelings it's not by
[1:59:27] feelings it's by
[1:59:29] faith say you're healed believe you're
[1:59:34] healed act like you're healed
[1:59:38] associate with those who believe in
[1:59:41] healing and God will bring you right out
[1:59:45] to a perfect soundness of health will
[1:59:48] not fail
[1:59:53] so you mean to tell me that just like
[1:59:57] even Brother Carlos when you went
[1:59:58] through the operation for the cancer
[2:00:00] that was there in your body you went
[2:00:02] through with a confession the Lord is my
[2:00:04] healer there was still a little spot
[2:00:07] that was there that they did radiation
[2:00:09] for how many days 36 36
[2:00:13] days and through it all the Lord is my
[2:00:18] healer what was it claiming God's
[2:00:23] promise standing on God's promised word
[2:00:26] so he wasn't lying when he said I am
[2:00:30] healed he wasn't
[2:00:32] lying yeah I know and yes I got to go
[2:00:35] through this radiation if that's what
[2:00:37] listen if God don't want me to go
[2:00:38] through it then God will stop
[2:00:41] it I can't control that that's in God's
[2:00:45] hands remember healing comes in one of
[2:00:48] four ways it's either like that of the
[2:00:50] lion where you stand with a boldness on
[2:00:53] it and God's giving you word or it's an
[2:00:56] ox we don't like the ox anointing but
[2:00:59] that's passing to the other side to our
[2:01:00] healing then there's also the man
[2:01:03] anointing that's medical Medical Science
[2:01:06] but there's also the eagle
[2:01:10] Miracle still God the whole time I can't
[2:01:14] control that I'll be honest with you I'm
[2:01:16] just you know I'm just being straight
[2:01:17] out with you there's many times would
[2:01:19] love for everything that comes my way
[2:01:21] it' be an eagle
[2:01:22] anointing but there's sometimes that God
[2:01:25] said there's still too much Samuel
[2:01:28] there and God's got to mold some things
[2:01:31] out not that I'm bad not that I you're
[2:01:34] better than me it's just God working on
[2:01:36] me just like he works on
[2:01:39] youall but what is it all along taking
[2:01:42] the promise of God and standing on that
[2:01:48] promise huj I'm
[2:01:51] Healed I think of brother Ron Spencer
[2:01:54] every Monday morning when he has to go
[2:01:57] and get expected to see if there's any
[2:01:59] more spots on the skin by a whole team
[2:02:02] of doctors and then scans that he has to
[2:02:04] go through over and over but yet through
[2:02:07] it all you'll see brother Ron stand
[2:02:10] right there and say I believe tonight I
[2:02:12] can walk out of this meeting completely
[2:02:16] whole are you hearing me it's not
[2:02:19] negative I realize the circumstan are
[2:02:21] around but in it all I'm not
[2:02:24] defeated I am not
[2:02:28] defeated Hallelujah you see sometimes
[2:02:30] it's us recognizing on how to balance
[2:02:32] and where we get so entangled in our
[2:02:35] mind I don't want to have a negative
[2:02:37] testimony think back to the text that I
[2:02:39] read you Paul was not negative when he
[2:02:43] said I'm
[2:02:45] perplexed but I'm not in despair amen
[2:02:50] he spoke of the conditions that was
[2:02:53] surrounding but he declared my feelings
[2:02:57] are not ruling this
[2:03:00] situation Paul where's your secret
[2:03:02] source of strength I'm drawing from The
[2:03:04] Unseen realm pulling it down into my
[2:03:08] life amen receiving
[2:03:10] strength amen would you stand with
[2:03:13] me I want you to do something here with
[2:03:15] me I
[2:03:16] just my there's
[2:03:22] many many powerful wonderful quotes that
[2:03:24] there's a lot more you could read but I
[2:03:26] only grabbed took certain ones I felt
[2:03:28] like that would help us the Lord pressed
[2:03:32] on my heart to do and but I want you to
[2:03:34] think of this when brother Bram he asked
[2:03:36] you know how many times brother brandham
[2:03:37] through the meetings would ask
[2:03:39] individuals and people he would he would
[2:03:41] let them know he said that you know I'm
[2:03:43] going to pray a
[2:03:45] prayer and I want you to repeat it
[2:03:49] pray it after
[2:03:52] me and brother Brown would say that and
[2:03:54] then he would tie that into to like the
[2:03:56] Roman nobleman speak the word
[2:03:59] only brother Brown would you know in
[2:04:01] many different places in the message he
[2:04:02] would say that and he would you know
[2:04:04] speak of how he say surely says I I
[2:04:06] should know what it takes to defeat
[2:04:08] Satan but he says I want you to repeat
[2:04:11] ran out of the message the living Jesus
[2:04:13] Christ he says I want you to pray it and
[2:04:16] repeat it I'll just
[2:04:19] repeat it you pray it I think this would
[2:04:23] be fitting starts out with the next
[2:04:25] thing almighty God I think it'd be
[2:04:28] fitting if we do this right here this
[2:04:30] morning now I'm not just doing this just
[2:04:32] as a
[2:04:34] routine I believe right here that God
[2:04:37] still answers
[2:04:39] prayer sure does I believe God still
[2:04:42] answers prayer amen hu can we can we go
[2:04:46] through this together almighty God God
[2:04:49] the author of Life Giver of every good
[2:04:53] gift look down upon me now in Mercy see
[2:04:57] my sickness and my conditions and Look
[2:05:01] Into My Heart Lord if there be any
[2:05:04] unbelief oh God take it from me now for
[2:05:08] I believe thee help thou my unbelief I
[2:05:13] am now coming with a sincere heart to
[2:05:16] accept my healing now make may my faith
[2:05:20] be sufficient to receive it in Jesus
[2:05:23] Christ's name I ask
[2:05:29] it Hallelujah brother Bram says as your
[2:05:33] heads are bowed and your eyes are closed
[2:05:35] he says I want you to imagine what Jesus
[2:05:38] is doing right now the Holy Spirit
[2:05:41] wooing over you his mercies and power
[2:05:45] coming into your body right now make
[2:05:48] making you well the angels of God are
[2:05:53] hovering around
[2:05:55] you I believe that's a
[2:05:59] declaration if there was a sister just
[2:06:02] one of them where I'm s right here where
[2:06:04] she was looking at the picture in the
[2:06:06] hospital she had the picture right there
[2:06:09] of the pillar of fire taken in the
[2:06:11] Houston Coliseum and she just began to
[2:06:14] look at that and begin to
[2:06:16] think upon the Lord she said brother
[2:06:19] brandham I can't explain it she said but
[2:06:21] that same Pillar of Fire came out of
[2:06:24] that picture and moved right through
[2:06:26] this
[2:06:27] room she walked out of there a well
[2:06:34] woman it's what we're looking
[2:06:37] at it's what we're looking
[2:06:40] at I am not going to give symptoms the
[2:06:44] time of day that's right no sir are you
[2:06:48] hearing me
[2:06:49] symptoms are not going to become
[2:06:50] something to our sure we feel pain we
[2:06:53] feel these things but it's not going to
[2:06:55] dictate by God's
[2:06:57] grace Our
[2:07:00] Lives you agree with that say Lord by
[2:07:03] your grace amen listen friends no matter
[2:07:05] where you're at this morning even for
[2:07:07] that of what God gave us even about
[2:07:10] salvation about the promise of the Holy
[2:07:12] Ghost listen I could have read countless
[2:07:14] quotes here of the Prophet approaching
[2:07:16] in that way you must take the word and
[2:07:19] believe it and I love how he said it he
[2:07:22] said if you can just take it on that
[2:07:24] basis then you take it and say it over
[2:07:27] and over and over say it out
[2:07:31] loud why would he say say it out loud
[2:07:34] you realize this is not the intelligence
[2:07:37] of a man who didn't even have a seventh
[2:07:39] grade education these things that I'm
[2:07:41] reading right here right now science has
[2:07:44] just finding out about in the past years
[2:07:47] right what when brother would preach of
[2:07:49] the the the conscience and subconscious
[2:07:52] and deal with that and tell us it's the
[2:07:55] guy down here on the inside that runs
[2:07:57] the ship so why is he saying say it out
[2:08:00] loud over and over and over why it's not
[2:08:04] me trying to talk down Satan is trying
[2:08:06] to get this guy down here to say all
[2:08:09] right let's pull out of the dock let's
[2:08:11] go

[2:09:52] morning he knew that Jericho was the
[2:09:55] first place to take but he didn't know
[2:09:59] how it was to be
[2:10:01] done but he
[2:10:03] went and he began to
[2:10:06] meditate away from all the
[2:10:09] noise and he met the
[2:10:12] chap the captain of the Lord's host
[2:10:17] Hallelujah it was when you made yourself
[2:10:21] known of who you were that Joshua laid
[2:10:25] down
[2:10:27] all of his thoughts laid down any idea
[2:10:30] laid down at all and say what would you
[2:10:32] have your servant
[2:10:35] Do Lord Jesus I feel this
[2:10:41] morning I feel I feel like Lord just
[2:10:45] like Joshua felt that morning that's not
[2:10:46] making me or these people anything
[2:10:48] anything else Lord but I believe you're
[2:10:50] the same God cuz there's things Lord
[2:10:52] that we we're just being honest Lord we
[2:10:54] don't know we know you've given us your

[2:19:05] just felt this was a good time to give
[2:19:07] it when we were young Christians just
[2:19:09] coming into the light and God's changed
[2:19:11] our life was doing some wonderful things
[2:19:13] for us so at this point or Christine
[2:19:19] some of you know her was just a little
[2:19:20] baby and had her in a little crib
[2:19:24] and uh she's good healthy woman now and
[2:19:27] they go to church that brother Chad's in
[2:19:29] Lia
[2:19:31] but she couldn't keep her food down and
[2:19:34] she would just kind come back up come
[2:19:37] back up and so we took her to the doctor
[2:19:41] and they found obstruction in her vow
[2:19:44] and we got a picture of her it's was
[2:19:47] just just a little skeleton there
[2:19:50] so I said when he we I did the surgery
[2:19:54] and that did good they got the
[2:19:55] instruction but then there was a great
[2:19:57] big hernia coming up on that baby's
[2:20:00] stomach and we back to see him and I
[2:20:04] said Doctor can can this Heria go away
[2:20:08] and he said no these kind will not go
[2:20:10] away he said we have to wait till this
[2:20:12] baby gets some strength and then we
[2:20:14] we'll operate on it and I said well
[2:20:17] doctor we're Christians we're going to
[2:20:19] have this baby prayed for he just looked
[2:20:22] at me so we Tu her back to Virginia
[2:20:25] because just I told you was young CH was
[2:20:27] looking for a church that believe this
[2:20:30] message but brother Mitchell that he's
[2:20:33] was healed on this day the scriptures
[2:20:35] fulfilled the Lord called him out he was
[2:20:37] coal Min and had a tumor on his lung and
[2:20:40] God healed him well he prayed with the
[2:20:42] baby we took her back to Ohio took her
[2:20:46] back to the doctor and the hernia was
[2:20:48] gone so thank God and he said I don't
[2:20:53] understand this so he flipped her on the
[2:20:55] Bott of her foot to make her cry cuz he
[2:20:57] thought maybe that'll make that come up
[2:20:59] there and it wouldn't he said shuck his
[2:21:01] head said this is something to be
[2:21:02] studied and I said I was thinking you
