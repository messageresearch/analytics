atmosphere oh god we're you lord our present lord jesus all things are possible lord to them that believe lord jesus we're just here lord to present ourselves this morning lord there's not one of us that has gathered here that would come here to be seen but lord we've come to hear from you there's needs that we have lord in our lives lord we believe dear god that you are mindful right now this moment lord that god even how that you would so set and so direct lord every part of this service lord for your will god there's a thought lord there's a lot of purpose that you have and lord the greatest desire of us is just to move into that channel all of us together lord god from song leader musician congregation speaker lord it's just to come into that channel oh god david would speak of that channel in many different ways he would speak lord of of the shadow of your protection lord you've been rude in the time lord of the song of solomon and how that lord as the bride we would find oh god our our protection lord in the shadow of your presence and lord we believe god we're in the shadow of your presence and we just lord want to receive oh god the strength the nourishment what you have for us lord lord we lay aside oh god the thoughts and the cares of this life because lord in truth we can't change them on our own lord but father we can just the lord yield our lives as instruments to you you lord are able to change and take situations that seem and look to be impossible lord for the lord it's not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the lord that this mountain shall be removed and lord we believe that oh god we just desire to enter into that channel let the lord the holy spirit just to have the right away so lord we ask them if there be anything that we have said or done lord any lord thought lord anything in any way lord we confess lord our sin and our unworthiness lord and we look to you o god that here as we've gathered in this moment that our lives would be further changed oh god in your presence lord granted lord we pray may you just move lord among us in a special way god to every heart lord oh granted we pray father we love you and thank you in jesus precious name amen amen if you'll turn with me to first john chapter 2 amen god bless you it's certainly good to be in the house of the lord and good to have visitors here with us amen trust you've just come to receive from the lord i want you just to just a few things to be aware of is we have a fellowship dinner that's planned for the 24th of this month sister soriano will be coming to visit us here and she'll be with us here for a week so she wanted to come and visit and uh i'm just so thankful that was one of the things upon our hearts that god would make that possible it's going to be different for all of us because we're used to seeing brother roell with her but you know i look at the part of it and i spoke to sister cindy at many different times leading you know when brother rowell was going through all of that and then even after and it's true uh but brother brown tells us he said it wouldn't be the ministry would not be what it is and that of a good man without a good woman to stand behind you and there's much much sacrifice that that went into that and so we just want to take that time that's why we even purposely we wanted another fellowship dinner but we really tried to work for it around that time so when she is here that you'd have an opportunity to to talk to her so if you talk beyond 10 minutes we're going to hook you away i'm not going to call nobody's name out now no but we want you to have time of fellowship with her you know things that you can say you know to her because they've certainly been brother roel and the ministry has certainly been a blessing to us here in the assembly and um also i want you just to keep in prayer brother nathan erickson will be standing in here this coming thursday for me and we'll be there leave out with paul benjamin are leaving out with me here after the service we have the services they started there yesterday and then we have services there monday through thursday a part that that we have and i certainly covet your prayers i really mean that i have a quote here i would read it but i don't for sake of time and you realize that that your prayers it's part of the ministry that god has given and and brother branham in this statement if i could if i would read it but he goes on to say he says it will be because of your prayers there will be a reward on the other side and i know we're not doing it for reward it's just it's to understand we're a part of this together if you would know me i'm i'm i haven't even left and i'm homesick already you say you're only going to indiana well i'm i'm a homebody god has a way of making you a pastor you know and i i just i so it's it just asks that you just pray for us that god will just move direct every part every service for his glory and i certainly appreciate that brother richard was telling me the other i'm going to tell this on brother richard this don't have anything to do with his age or anything like that but he's still a young man but he saw brother samuel he said i was already praying for you last week i said those prayers weren't in vain they weren't in vain because of the studying and the preparation and things you know that uh going into that and it's just been months just leading into this so we just i appreciate those prayers and um we just love you amen miss you so you only be one service but i miss you i already miss you right now i love you i love you in the lord and think about the privilege we're going to have to spend eternity together amen all the all the toils of this life will seem nothing when we get to the end of the way amen may god bless you richly first john chapter 2 verse 12 i write unto you little children because your sins are forgiven you for his namesake i write unto you fathers because ye have known him that is from the beginning i write unto you young men because ye have overcome the wicked one i write unto you little children because you have known the father i have written unto you fathers because you have known him that is from the beginning and i have written unto you young men because you are strong and the word of god abideth in you and you have overcome the wicked one amen may god bless the reading of the word as you're being seated just look for his direction in here this morning and as we look here into this scripture as we were moving in this a few weeks ago i'd like to continue to speak on that thought i write unto you fathers and realizing that when john would write this under inspiration of the holy spirit that god is setting forth the the full counsel that would be in the body of jesus christ at that time and in the every every local body i think about this when i look at this scripture as it comes to me and i think about brother branham's burden when this message would come and when you know there was the chur there was the tabernacle there in jeffersonville where he could freely go and you know minister deliver the word of the lord he had some other open doors that he could go to you know even when brother branham was very very cautious he taught us a lot and this is probably maybe for ministers that certain areas you just be very sensitive and watch for even when brother branham went to jack brother jack moore's he he never just took a pulpit for granted or is just an open opportunity he said many times as he went there in those last services in 65 he says you know he says they it hasn't really struck brother jack and they really don't grasp what this message is but he but brother brother branham went there and he says you know i try not to speak things you know that would be of such depth or or different things like that when i go he says but then again he says however god will lead and that's what we ultimately look to is the leadership of the holy spirit and i say that with this mind you know there's probably not i don't know i don't want to just say this but there are some areas where sometimes we have maybe more churches than other other areas but i'll say this in this way when we look at and think that there are many many lives that i would say in this manner that we can look and say they are truly fathers in this message it's not that they're fathering children of their own seed because we've had that right we've had movements where they put out their teaching and all it is all it does is produce it produces the image of that individual and that's no different from you know a baptist producing a baptist pentecostal pentecostal so we don't want to be we don't want to be a reproduction or reproducing of ourselves we want we want christ to be reproduced in the lives of the people that's why every life every heart that would stand even behind the sacred desk of almighty god and and even in our homes we want our lives to be as eunuchs to where that life itself we have no seed or no agenda of our own our only ambition and our only desire is to see jesus christ glorified and that's the focus when it's all said and done and i i just say you know i think of different brothers that's went on home to be with the lord i think of different ones uh you know that we're with i think of my own uh my own dad there was so many different things that even on his uh you know this will be five years since he's passed it i remember speaking to him not knowing that it was going to be the last hours that i would actually see him but i i i spoke to him in that time and i said i'd come back from a i'd come back from a gathering and it was so pressed on my heart and i just told him i said dab i want to thank you i said for not only your stand for this message but more importantly i want to say thank you for the example that you showed what this message is i said that twice and it was the last times that i hugged my dad i didn't know it it would be that that particular day but i'm saying in this way thank god for fathers and i don't want to just leave it out there that it's fathers that it would be as far as ministers or i i want to bring it down to this right here and bringing it down to even in this even in this local assembly god desires that there are fathers and i believe we have some fathers fathers to where there's lives that are are balanced in the word of god it's not pulled this way or that way but are balanced able to see things to where growth is taking place looking at things and looking past things and able to be an encouragement to be an example to be a help and because as a father you've passed through some of those some of those pathways and and it's not just age that does it it's experiences and here here is what paul is writing or john is writing of that i write unto you fathers because you have known him and that word no it deals with i love how it splits it up and i referred to this to you before between the greeks the greeks was always about knowledge what they know and they could re they could put back out but that's not how the jews know it the jews look at knowing and this is how jesus and how john by the spirit of god was was impressing it that was to know something you do not actually know it until it becomes outworking in your life so what's it speaking of is you have known the father in other words there's a relationship there i don't know i don't know exactly how far i'll get on this this morning but you know the relationship that is the purpose of the gospel of jesus christ it's not rules it's not do's and don'ts i understand when god first gets a hold of a life there's things you're looking at when we don't do this and i don't do that remember those are all parts of the working of the holy spirit bringing you to awareness but the whole thing that it's leading to is a relationship with almighty god that's the power that's why that when god came down and became flesh is that he might pay the price break down the middle wall of petition what was between us and him that sin debt that was separating there from being a real union the holy spirit could move upon the lives it did the holy spirit moved even upon the lives of the prophets it would move upon them pull back it would move upon them pull back but now when he god himself comes down here at the river jordan now is an opening of what adam lost in the beginning upon whom thou shalt see the spirit descending and abiding upon there was the announcement that now that relationship of god like david would write where mercy and truth are met and hugged and kissed together it was writing of how that relationship was now going to be restored it would be god living in the life and the heart of an individual to where it's not what i know here but the knowing of it is that life living itself out through me [Music] and this is what this is why when paul would write of this and i i mentioned to this the last time and i just want to say this again it is in every assembly we see it no matter where you go there's going to be fathers there's young men there's children and that you can apply that and take it even out of the male aspect and place it within a congregation there's all different levels of maturity that is taking place and it's not up it's not up to you and i to walk around and say well that's a child and you know this one's toddler this no with this responsibility that every one of us have in this hour with cultivating what we have right here in our midst and it's not one who's above another and higher up but when you really recognize you know let me just say this as it comes some there can be a life that says well i'm a father and people ought to be following me that's not a father you might be you might have been around the message for a long time but a father is one who's able to condem sin it's where pride itself is is out of the way it's it's not about self like i have something i can really help this church and i can't no that's not a father but a father sees is able to be sensitive seeing the need knowing the time frame the age the things some of the even the things that a person would go through and how that they're able to move and to help them paul wrote of this to titus of how the older men were to help the younger men is that right that's right he also wrote how that you know the older sisters are to help the younger sisters i think we could pause here just for a moment to where it comes to reflection and say god am i doing my part because this whole assembly this this part god didn't put us anywhere else he placed us right here this now becomes a responsibility a burden of what can i do oh my i write unto you fathers and so we see that of the fathers as that of of one that you know is maturity then with equity and justice and judgment and and i i think of how that when i was looking here in the scriptures and i referred to this quote the last time out of the token where you'll notice how that it was jacob who gave the direction to the household to get yourself ready get prepared for the crossing jacob was actually making ready little did he know it but he was going to have a meeting with god he knew he was back in the place where god had visited him right and the god of bethel so now jacob takes that direction to give leadership to the household same way that joshua did when joshua called there of the heads of the tribe he gave direction to them concerning the application of the token and of the life it shows a responsibility that we have within our lives now i i want to read here from the scripture in joshua chapter 4 verse 21 and here as paul or joshua would write here and he would speak unto the children of israel now this is after they crossed the jordan and he would say when your children shall ask their fathers in time to come saying what mean these stones so i want you to catch this this is a a supernatural working that these believers have been a part of there are many within here right now that they were some of those who their parents had said we can't go over in the land the land will just swallow them up but now after those 40 years had passed away those had died off that you know had stood in opposition to the word there there were those because there were some fathers who stood with the word you understand sometimes we get to looking at all the negative but there was some positive there as well the positive might not have been the big in number but god don't need numbers god only needs lives that are surrendered god can do more with one life that's surrendered than it can with ten thousand bodies it's a surrendered it's all of the surrendered effort notice when they would come across what a supernatural working here that has taken place let me finish reading it then you shall let your children know saying israel came over this jordan on dry land for the lord your god i want you to catch this this is what you're to let the children your children know when they come to that time and they ask this question this is what you're to say for the lord your god dried up the waters of jordan from before you in other words you wouldn't be here if god had not made a way is letting them know it's not by chance you were born in this land it's not by chance you were raised in this message it's not a chance with god god has made a way hallelujah you weren't born in egypt and i'm not going to take you back to egypt i'm not going to let egypt come in the house are you hearing me now that's your responsibility i write unto you fathers oh glory be to god oh my for the lord your god hallelujah dried up the waters of jordan from before you until ye were passed over as the lord your god did to the red sea which he dried up be from before us until we were gone over in other words he's the same god under the same conditions he'll act the same way he'll do the same thing because he's jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever did you see this is the responsibility i write unto you fathers that there is such a reality that jesus christ is the same it's not enough to have it on a tape case not enough to have it on the back of the book not enough that it lays inside of the bible but it's got to be inside our lives [Applause] it's gotta be god with skin on that jesus christ is the same that the people of the earth might know the hand of the lord that it is mighty you're catching this the hand of the lord god uh when you look in the scriptures the personification how god you'll see that the hand of the lord the army of the lord all of a saint what it shows this is god making contact with his subjects the word becoming flesh the word becoming visible the word becoming manifest and we know that the hand of the lord is his strength and his power [Applause] that it is mighty that you might fear the lord your god forever in other words no matter where you're at in your generation no matter what things that you've been through it still holds to be the same way he's the same lord jesus i know there's a lot of things that's rose up in this earth and in this world that we're living in it's a lot of the same spirits that everyone has fought there's a lot of different modes a lot of different media a lot of different ways it comes but let me say this there is no nothing that is too great that god won't part the way am you saying brother samuel we don't just say that listen in this home right here this is what just was writing to that you let god be the center of everything in your life daddy i've got a test today that's no big that's not too big for god i've got a situation at work that's not too big for god come on somebody oh daddy i feel like quitting no god's a mighty god god's a waymaker oh i'm rejected ruth felt rejected but god's a waymaker hallelujah i'm like esther but god's a waymaker you know what's showing them that he's a mighty god in the face of opposition he's a mighty god hallelujah oh my in other words this the word itself let me say it like this the word would be such a part of their lives if this was what in speaking in joshua 4. this is not where the word is a switch where we turn it on on thursday if you do when we turn it off and turn it back on on sunday that's not what that's that don't result because if that in itself the children will never ask the children you see when it says what mean if these things some of them would not even live close to gilgal you know what gilgal is beginning that the children must see they need a beginning they need an experience with god there's got to be a rolling away of the reproach of egypt so there to be such the presence of almighty god within that home that doesn't mean you're walking on the water let me just try to just try to move that don't mean you're walking on the water that don't mean that fish are being created and god can do what he wants because he's still god let me tell you something friends he i've seen him a provider we can look all around this assembly here and there's testimonies on things like that you can't limit god but let me just tell you let me just give you a little personal testimony when there's things that's done like that in my home i look around and not only during devotion time i'll i'll draw the attention to it but as i'm standing right there there was something that came up here you know in in a way and benjamin happened to be coming in the kitchen that evening and i had this paper is this all right i had this paper from my from my insurance company and i thought this says on here they're not going to cover my roof anymore it's over i thought well they're not going to cover that it's over 15 years old now mind you mind you i already had a guy that had come out because there had been a lot of damage on them roofs out where i live i didn't know i wasn't getting no drops i thought everything good they went and inspected it and there was wind damage all over my roof and hail damage now after it's already been approved and the roof and all that other stuff see i'm reading that paper forgive me i had to read it five times because i wasn't getting what it was saying i thought i was being penalized because they were paying for a new roof for me and i went from there and i wasn't even looking for a new roof but brian fit have been left up to me look i i got everything laid out in front of me here i'm looking at the regular services counseling here and meetings i have coming up that is on the back burner i'm just being honest we all do stuff like that right probably still got the same you know shower you're trying to fix you've been promising you're going to fix it anyhow we won't go there because we want this to be positive but you know what i'm saying and i stood right there and i was reading it and to realize here on july 1st they would no longer have covered my roof because it was over 15 years old i stood right there and i after reading it fifth time benjamin walked in there i said ben listen while i read this and i'm going to explain it to you and i went through and i said this is what i'm saying he's jehovah jireh even in daddy's ignorance my ignorance push it on back i can't i want that on my mind right now i don't want to even though it's not me putting it on but i don't want to interact with people right now and all these bids and i don't want to deal with that right now i'll get to that you know in july probably july come i kick it to august because there's things there i'll kick it to this month eventually i've been kicked in next year and didn't say i'll give you that example because it's important we are we are believers friends we expect and we look to god even when we don't realize things are taking place he's still jehovah jireh and you call that attention why there's going to be times in his life that what he's got to rely on is jehovah chara is my provider [Music] he's bigger than what my outlook is on things he's greater than what i can see it's pointing them to the care of almighty god if you'll just walk with god god said i'll bless everything else you won't have to focus on this and focus on that i know sometimes there's still things you know brother brian we gotta fix i thought he was gonna bless this and then well he does he blessed us with other brothers or we can say how do i repair this toilet come on now and i wasn't just taught my brother brian your brother drake it's before they got into being you know the plumbers and things like that those guys probably look at me if i call them about something oh man brother samuel this little simple abc thing here no i don't bug him too much so it's something that the word i want to say like this i'm writing to your father's what a charge that's what joshua was telling them these memorials that are here i want it to be such within your heart in your life to when it comes to that time they ask what does this mean something that just it just turns it up what does this mean now let me go to hebrews chapter 7 and verse 5 and here the bible says verily they that are the sons of levi who receive the office of the priesthood have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law that is of their brethren though they come out of the loins of abraham but he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of abraham and blessed him that had the promises and without contradiction the less is blessed of the better and here men that die receive tithes but there he receiveth them of whom it is witnessed that he liveth and as i may so say levi also who received tithes paid tithes in abraham for he was yet look where he was at he was yet in the loins of his father when melchizedek met him this was think of this god already had a lot of it in other words let me just step back just a moment this is where the predestination and sometimes i don't know why that seems you know to be such a hard difficult word it's in the scriptures but predestination is where we have we have to come back and you look back into the very foreknowledge of almighty god and as you look back into that of the foreknowledge of god this is where election steps in and foreknowledge only looks it directs to the destiny that's before us in other words my children came from my loins they were not outside of me god has an elect group of people listen there's going to be listen now there's going to be others saved not in the bride but there's going to be millions say matter of fact in the mother's day message brother branham makes this statement he said there'll be people there that you didn't even think would be there i could go through different testimonies as the brothers gave me things you know and then the things in the life there of brother branham as well and different i'm not going to do that but i'll just say it in this way you know it's not up to me or you to decide who's who and and whatever i'm glad about that our desire our job is just to go is to serve the lord in our lives just love him and let his loving life flow through us let me say this to you if someone is not ordained for for the election i trust that that life that moving through my life and your life would have such an effect on them that they would be all that god has them to be come on now brother bram said the man's a catholic man if he's trusting in the church he's lost but if he's trusting in jesus christ he's safe [Applause] now there ain't just one place i can go over and over throughout the message with that that's why oh my goodness this is why that you know when we're speaking to others i don't want to tremble them if there is something that's moving and i can see there's a little opening there's little things that we can give little things to see is there a hunger for more if there's not has the prophet told us from the scriptures let edom alone he said let the methodists alone. you've got to call for a cross jordan you go across jordan [Applause] you see what liberty that brings in our life then i mean we already have liberty if we've been born again but it takes away our own self-made homemade stress they're not seeing this and they're not saying this and here we are i'm gonna have coffee with them and we're so tensed up we're ding ding ding ding ding ding ding i'm getting my quotes prepared let me just tell you what happens the atmosphere of the holy spirit is killed right there what should i do just be available just be available if god leads you to say something then say something sometimes we feel i'm going to preach now sometimes we feel that it's the things that we say it's more than what you say it's the atmosphere and the way you live hallelujah i'll just give this testimony my brother aaron sister man to set in here when they first came over and they had a and we invited them over i don't know what year that was that's a long time ago i remember that chocolate cake we had that night though remember that one addie was in a carrier we came over that night now i'm praying in my heart because i i know that god's dealing with hearts i'm praying lord what do you want me to do well that night and they could probably tell you about this there's not that i know of not one scripture or not one thing that i made and approached them but there was testimonies and i said the lord directed this if the lord willing the lord made a way everything was about him i didn't do that purposely come on friends sometimes if we're not careful we'll feel like well i let the lord down no just yield the bible says take no thought what you shall say it'll be given to you if the word if you lay in the word the word itself is in here it'll come together [Applause] hallelujah [Music] he was yet in the loins of his father when melchizedek met himself the same approach of abraham recognizing melchizedek and once you think of this when all the slaughter they were coming back and here all those kings were gathered they were all gathered together kings remember kings are those of great highly influence everybody call them influencers now they were all gathered into king's dale on the web are you hearing me now so here all these kings all these influencers all these big people but abraham in the beginning went after lot with the right purpose the right motive to bring him back he was not there because of the riches or that someone could add to him abraham knew what i have no man has added it to me when god spoke to me and god called me and i wasn't you know i didn't see everything i didn't make all my steps right right away but where i am right now it's his leadership it's his care it's his blessing upon my life i have not rested are you hearing me on the arm of flesh i have rested on the one that spoke to me [Applause] and when he spoke to me he breathed into my life there was a strength there was a confidence that went beyond my reasoning abilities to leave the livelihood of god making to leave your kindred your family all these things to leave that but it shows the effect of the word as it impressed upon abram's life god starts are you hearing me now watch how god started with abraham abraham wasn't if i could say in this way at the moment when he left the ur of kandi he wasn't fully converted but you see it isn't just something you pick from over here pick it up and drop it down there god works i hope you're catching me now god works god works all along the step of the way just like when abraham abraham went his way he came under hard time came under pressure went down there into gorier you know the stories came back god never in any way notice god's presence pulled back but now god allows a situation and there's think of this now there is that which is present that would cause abraham to look back to the land i've got to get back to the land he knew that in the land there was acceptance that's what god gave originally if i can get back to the land and when he got back to the land the bible says the lord appeared to him [Music] god didn't say well you did what i told you not to do so silence i'm going to give you the silent treatment now he did when he was down there guerrero because he can't talk to him when he's out of the will of god see the atmosphere was not right but you see what had been impressed upon his life and god knowing what's there god's got confidence in his word and sometimes when the actions themselves do not match but god looks beneath the actions and he said it's my word that's down there that's the same way in each of our lives we might as well preach our actions have not been a hundred percent right on come on friends paul said i gotta die daily but all along the journey god's desire is to bring us into that place that he's prepared for us [Applause] my but let me pause on that here this morning because we could just labor there but notice this same approach of recognizing melchizedek bestowing the the tenth the most choice part in other words what is this is this is that of which is the most of value to bestow honor upon let me say this that meeting that that abraham had there among all the other kings would be also reflected in his home i'm not talking about because he had his picture taken i'm not talking about because well he could just talk about about that event but abraham after meeting their melchizedek now god had appeared himself in there of a bodily form but notice how did now did abraham bestow this upon his children because abraham in his life and in his walk was to keep that christ would be the center of it all so it's not just something of a past it's not just a memorial but in order to look back to that memorial in other words where abraham's children grandchildren rise up and say i want to meet that same one papa that you met i want to meet that same one daddy that you met because melchizedek didn't stay on a plane preach with me now melchizedek the bible says he was the king and priest of that city jerusalem that was the earthly jerusalem the prophet picks it up in the message shalom he said what it was he was put out of the city the way christ in the last days has been put out of the church hallelujah our lives have been made a place for melchizedek to come and dwell our homes are made a place for melchizedek to come and dwell because that's the word the king of salem salem means peace but if you don't got the peace giver you have no peace hallelujah think of this levi let me come back to the to the statement there levi paying tithes to melchizedek just didn't happen in other words this spoke of what every one of the sons of abraham would do when they would meet god personally right now i'm on the job i'm going to just kind of trying to slow down but we'll see i want to just drive this point home it didn't just happen it just didn't well if they're elected well if they're predestinated you sound like god's a gambler shame on you god's not a gambler when god sets forth his word he's active with his word when god with his children he's active with his children god said i'm invested in my children my children are going to know my name my children are going to know my ways my children are going to know me [Applause] i'll text bomb their phone my children are going to know me no they need something for me they're going to know me they're going to know me in many different ways you see because i'm not only jehovah jireh i'm jehovah rafa [Applause] i'm jehovah's sitconu i'm jehovah shalom they're going to know me because all these things throughout their life and their walk they are going to know me i am going to manifest that i am the all-sufficient one it just didn't happen like with abraham god just didn't say and speak to abraham and then just say we'll put it on autopilot buddy and you just make it there no god dealt with and worked with and ministered to abraham [Music] sometimes let me just say this sometimes when we look at the word the word being impactful remember brother brahma will tell us like this he said you might have had a man he said that preached the word to you and that man no longer follows this word power transformation he said but remember it wasn't the man that changed your life it was the word of god that came forth it's the word that holds transforming power in it say brother samuel what he's saying that as a parent as believers as brothers and sisters we glorify in the lord jesus christ we know this word is effective the word is a seed that the sore went forth to sow it has within it the power of almighty god to bring it to pass in its season and it's time oh help me preach i might just have to water it a little bit i might have to water and say hey you want to go fishing tomorrow i would do too maybe you can call down there and get me out of some meetings you say how are you watering that right there because i'm watering it that seed by a relationship as well that's how god waters his word not everything happened in abraham's life right away but god was right there because it's the presence of god that brings the word of god to past i write unto you fathers [Applause] everything everything if you could talk with abraham and abraham repair appeared on uh good morning shalom if abraham appeared on there and you asked abraham abraham you know we got all these parenting magazines around and we got this one and we got that one and we got this and you know it tells them to do this and tells them to do that abraham what would you say the most important thing is i would say the most important thing is in everything let it be centered around if christ is a centered then let everything you do or say be set up and pointing with an expectation for their meeting with melchizedek because i can provide them with clothes i can provide them with a house i can provide them with water to drink but it will take him to provide the bread and the wine that they have needed to live victorious so what is it not putting the emphasis on the wrong things not putting the emphasis on the material things but the emphasis is on the spiritual things now listen friends these things that god's bringing them we're bringing them and they rejoice our hearts and even sometimes as they're cutting our lives but it ought to be things that we we want to take into our lives and really reflect and reflect and say god change me evaluate things it's in my life if my priorities are wrong if i've got the wrong order then let it be lined up everything that we're doing is focused upon that meeting with melchizedek well brother samuel i can't i can't cause them to meet melchizedek but you are missing me now before the lord jesus came that was a promise of the coming messiah isaiah 7 14 isaiah 9 6 on and on we can go with prophecies genesis 3 15 all those were prophecies right but there was also a prophecy that lay in the word that before and in the midst of that coming there would be one who would be a forerunner and the one who was a forerunner would receive the holy ghost in his mother's womb and what was the purpose to do prepare the way of the lord that's parenting i write unto you fathers that's also that's to every one of us as you work as we work in this assembly and others and listen listen i'll just say it like this okay i look at it i am not i know there can be pride that god lord i know there's no doubt there's still pride in my life that you're working out but let me just tell you something i want god to work and move through every individual and i'll tell you this right now my children it ain't that oh it's all got to come from me they they they they're they're with me but i believe that there are examples there's effects of this word all around brother samuel how do you feel i trust you feel the same way these young people when they come to my house i look at them as my children i don't care if i don't see them they're called out in prayer daily and if i find out where they work i'm going even when i find others i find out where they work and their backlash i just met one i usually walk on the trail uh out there at a certain park and i kept looking at this this one uh a lady i kept looking at her i thought who in the world that looks like mindy that looks like her you know brother joey's sister wow it looks like her so finally the other day paul's i said hey hold on a minute is your name mindy she said yes what'd you do stand there and talk to her i found out some that worked in a certain kitchen somewhere you say you just like to eat no i went there at times and i didn't eat nothing but i found out that they worked there i'm not just trying to do something friends i didn't go there every day but sometimes what people need is a personal contact with jesus christ not just tracks not just tracks not just the bible they need the bible walking in flesh i write unto you fathers see what god's trying to help within lives so you don't feel oh i didn't say something i didn't quote this i didn't come right out and say you must be born again oh i praise god i told them that no no god's trying to get us away from those condemnation of well i didn't say this and i didn't say this oh i must be a compromiser you're not a compromiser the word of god means everything to you [Applause] it's opening that channel we all listen friends we all learn and we're all here growing we're not here well i'm this and i'm no no we're all here to learn father every one of us every one of us lord every one of us oh i'm so thankful he continues to teach me how to be a better daddy how to be a better husband how to be a better pastor there's things that god has opened up and i thought good lord i was causing myself so much stress well maybe nobody else ain't been nobody else but i'll tell you you know what i'll tell you what it really about called i'm ready to do a praise break when those things happen like that and i see it you know why it's deliverance of self who did brother branham say is the one that gets in the way william branham not brother branham william branham was made to claire he never said brother branham gets in the way william branham gets in the way we can put our name there too now notice this the bible says in genesis 18 17 our glory and the lord said now i want you to think back now to this we're looking at israel melchizedek and notice how god appears in genesis 18 verse 17 and the lord said shall i hide from abraham that thing which i do saying that abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him for i know him now notice this i know him he's not just talking about like an acquaintance or you know me and brother joshua we met we met here some years ago how many years have been now seems like forever but how many years i mean that a good way i mean a good forever sometimes you know people five minutes seem like forever six years then what god's talking about with abraham oh that i just met him he knew him before the foundation of the world what he knew him he knew him now it has become into an expression i know him who's he talking about abraham his son his child [Music] that he will command his children and his household after him that they shall keep the way of the lord to do justice and judgment that the lord may bring upon abraham that which he hath spoken of him now i want you just to think of this here just for a moment let me just i i wasn't going to pull this up but i want to just refer to it i'll probably pick it up again and the next time in genesis 12 verse verse 1 and the lord said unto abram get me out of that country and from thy kindred and from thy father's house unto a land that i will show thee and i will make the make of thee a great nation this is what i'm going to do i'm not asking your permission this is what i'm going to do this is what i know of you abraham might have been looked at and said this package you got the wrong house my wife's barren god said you can't rts this package i'm gonna make now did abraham understand that no but he had faith in the i am who was speaking it isn't that he understood how all of this was going to come to pass [Applause] understanding will come in its season and its time as we have need of it ah corey ten boom's father corey timberland when she was young and she said you know she wanted to hear about the birds and bees and she was what about this with the birds and beasts she did she didn't know boy what a what a day to live you know to where that mom and dad are the instructors and i believe we we we we are to be intentional of these things while we're going there we might as well go oh that's taboo brother samuel well if you don't talk about it in the right time tell me who is [Applause] oh brother samuel i don't believe that's real spiritual hebrew series brother branham would gather on a sunday afternoon all the young men together one one sunday and he spoke about those things [Music] then the next sunday get all the young ladies together and speak about it i'm telling this message it's come with direction and leadership [Applause] he's here to lead us all the way but he's wanting you and i i have no hands but your hands no feet but your feet and corey tim boom when she asked her father that little just way her daddy had this suitcase was right there next to him it was heavy and so he said courtney he said can you can you pick that up for daddy and corey she went over she said she said daddy i can't it's too heavy for me he said honey what you've asked daddy about right now it's too heavy for you but when it's time we'll sit down and talk about it catching you see all these things it isn't like oh let's lay it out what time should it be the times vary i don't know we're going to go here all the time the time is very but this is you say well how do i know that's why living close to your children that's why living close to your children a shepherd ought to smell like the sheep. absolutely i don't believe i'm going to preach i don't believe a pastor ought to be just a figure that shows up but i don't do it because well i just believe it that way i love and i'm not saying other brothers listen friends sometimes maybe a brother there are certain things they have to put in place maybe would say different things you understand don't put no judgment on anybody i'm just speaking right here to me i enjoyed that and i believe i'm just going to say i believe every other one does too you love being with the people of god there's nothing greater i love than fellowshipping with god's children especially you all there's no other place i'd rather preach and minister right here but it's to it's to get right down with it and you know when we're looking at things and we're talking with one another because let me tell you something you'll never help nobody if they don't know you don't love them i don't know where time goes do you don't worry we're not an eternity sometimes you think let me just refer let me refer to this right here in verse two and i will make of thee a great nation and i will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing this word blessing it is a different word usage than blessed but blessing means the source of blessing god was speaking to abraham and let him know you are the channel that i'm gonna come into your household i am the vine you are the branches you are going to be the doorway that the blessings of god all that i have pronounced it's gonna come through your life it won't be not you doing it i will make i will make i will make so you open the door and invite me in and i do what you can i'm the one who brings the word to pass thou shalt be a blessing a source of life so now because of that then we when we read let me go back to verse 19 of genesis 18 for i know him he will command his children and his household after him that they shall keep the way of the lord to do justice and judgment and the lord that the lord may bring upon abraham that which he has spoken of him so there's going to be more channels that'll be sources of blessing right through abraham's life it didn't just happen it didn't just oh oh melchizedek who's melchizedek oh the prophet oh what's a prophet let me just say this and i'm not here to step on toes maybe it'll stomp on a little bit but if your children sitting here if they don't know about the message you didn't just bring them to sunday school or a youth meeting and drop them off it's your responsibility i'm preaching straight now i ain't saying you got to stand up in your living room you got to have a podium and you start preaching i tell what i'm saying but i'm saying that these are things right now that ought to be in the home hearing the message should not be a foreign thing it should not be a foreign thing where your your children know this is daddy's prayer time this is mama's prayer time are you hearing him he's not putting on a show it might not be a foreign thing again we can quiet now but that's all right that's all right it's a truth well you know if they want to know about it they can just they can just listen to a tape it ought to be something that that it should not be foreign in other words not just waiting till they come to the house of god we're talking about marriage oh i'll wait for brother salmon to go over you ought to be instructors on that as well watching over that well my this is that's a total difference you understand we are keepers my brothers and sisters i'm not talking about that in our perfection don't anybody just start hanging your head i'm talking about a responsibility that we have we must be intentional let me close with this your attitude towards christ out of the hebrew series will make a great impression on what your children will be now he didn't just say all that i say all that you say all that you well i no it's your attitude let me just say what attitude is attitude it's a way of thinking feeling that's reflected in a person's behavior church again man if i could just stay home tonight or stay home today you know i tell you yeah my my back's hurting me well usually mine does and my hip does and other things at times too i'm not making a lot of anybody's you understand because i know there's i know there's some right here that that set with it that very serious but you understand your children are only going to do what you do can i give you a little testimony here you know i've mentioned different things about brother ron spencer and you know brother ron dealing with stage four brother ron was going down there and there's been times on the sunday mornings when i've i've just felt led on my heart to text him on a sunday morning and right then there's a time of sickness and things and but here he was he was getting ready he had to go preach a meeting and i think it was a it was a saturday night service there brother sean martin's meeting he had to pull over on the road eight times and threw up eight times and they said you know are you sure he said i'm he said i'm going to stand there and preach he said because satan knows if all it takes is eight times for me to throw up and i won't come to church he'll make sure eight times will be brother say we're saying what are you saying i'm trying to show you this is not dna of spencer it was not dna of brother branham it's not your dna or my dna i'm talking about there are things that we've got to override our flesh our feelings brother branham said his flesh came to him and said your throat's a little scratchy tonight why don't you stay home brother brown says i rose up on the inside i promised brother neville that i would be there look we're only going to get whatever seeds we sow in let me just try to finish this quote we'll pick it up next time your attitude towards christ will make a great impression on what your children will be your life that you live before your family will make an impression on what your children will be notice the things that brother branham is dealing with it's the life that's lived before not just what we say but the life that's lived before and i can tell you this message will produce a life not a conforming you can conform to this message and still not have the real life this is not a conforming or reforming message it's a message from the throne of god listen god had a channel in this age like he had of abraham a channel that was ordained in the word that would be a channel that the source of blessing could move through to this age aren't you glad but now from that there's now there's channels that god has that has received of this life not just received books not just receive tapes not just receive knowledge of it but receive a change on the inside of their lives and are a manifestation of this word that's a source of blessing it becomes a channel for god to move through for god to work through our attitude will affect our children that's what lays the impression that's why not just the things that we do or we say but we do don't do as i say only but do as i do remember the little boy here's a little boy was walking he was doing this his daddy looked behind him and said what are you doing junior what are you doing he said daddy i'm just following your footsteps daddy was stumbling around drunk falling in the snow bank falling that snow bank he said daddy i'm just following your footsteps i can only follow the footprints that you make for me make sure every footprint is pointing till melchizedek if your life is heading this way this morning you don't have to keep going that way god is not here to bury you in oh i failed here i failed it that's not what god is doing let me tell you something esther you can arm yourself [Music] armed with what with the baptism of the holy ghost and where the enemy has tried and said i'm going to slay all of your kindred on this day but here esther was moved if i die i die but i'm going to get to his throne there's a need mordecai told her mordecai said if you're not going to be the channel god ain't going to let his word be defeated he'll find another channel that's right in the word what did it do it rolls up esther realized wait a minute i am placed here for such a time as this [Applause] [Music] if i perish i perish she went in and became a channel of deliverance for her people [Music] that one move hung haymon on his own neck that one move where he said i'm going to kill their children i'm going to get in the households i'm going to destroy one move [Applause] the very gallow he made little did he know he was going to be hung on that rope [Applause] what rose the boldness and the strength and the courage in esther the word of the lord that would remind her who she was and with that god's word is certain if you're not going to be a channel in other words this is why the scripture reads it deliverance shall arise from another place one way or another god's gonna deliver his people [Applause] so i say why not now why not us why not me why not right now let our attitude let everything rise let it rise within our hearts i write unto you fathers you see friends it's a moment it's a time to just pause and just to stop and just to think and consider because if you're headed this direction you don't have to keep heading that direction you said brother samuel how do i stop repent and really repent real repentance is not i'm in a mess boy i've got all this in my life look how my life that ain't repentance that's called worldly sorrow pitying yourself i've got to preach it as you bring it to me that's scriptural paul called that worldly sorrowing and there's times listen there's times where we get in our penny parties but that ain't repentance repentance is where there's a the bible said godly sorrow in other words you're looking unto him and you realize what he has done for you even when you have not acknowledged him that he has watched over your life he has kept you alive for this moment that you might have another opportunity to receive his grace [Applause] that brings godly sorrow to realize me little me lord jesus what you did for me now you're coming to the revelation of jesus christ it's starting to break the effects of it is starting to move what it's pointing and recognizing him who bore my shame jesus yes show us the father and it sufficeth us have i been so long with you when you have seen me you have seen the father oh how i love him how i adore him what condensation bringing us redemption that in the dead of the night with not one faint hope inside god gracious tender laid aside his splendor stooping to woe to win and save my soul hallelujah his presence and that in just something back 2000 years ago that was acted out from the mind of god he's a messiah right here this morning the living god the holy spirit the same almighty god the father revealing himself in this hour to turn our lives and our hearts unto him and for every one of us that god man what's a complete relationship and for every life to think or we can stop and i believe it's i believe it's for our lives as a believer is to let our lives be examined by the word and say god if there's something not hitting the mark i'm not i'm not come here to be telled what a good guy i am right we've not been come to told we are short we want our shortcomings showed up right we're family here come on we're family we want the word of god to come down i want my shortcomings to be exposed because the same one who's exposing them he's a faithful father he not only deals with where we're at the prophet said but catch us where we need to be in other words he's not one who says what you did that defines who you are that's who you'll always be but i'm i'm no longer i no longer i've grown up and you get my kindergarten picture no longer matches me that ain't how god looks at things god don't put you in a box and say this is who you are but the word moses changes us shapes us there's things that we even look at differently right now than we did in the past you know why because of his grace no wonder david said i want to abide in your tabernacle i want to behold thy beauty of that character of that glory of thy person that i might inquire in your temple then i might say lord as you reveal on yourself lord change my life lord i give myself to you lord just continue to give ourselves to him i will make of thee i will make of thee i will make of thee god what do i have just be it just be a channel just be a channel just drink drink push out i'll do it it'll be me doing it oh don't you love him i'll tell you in this hour that's a thing that we can say is that lord beyond any words see god didn't just give us a word in this day he came he came the amen came the amen is here he he didn't just give us a word but it's a life a life that's been laying i'd say oh god let my attitude lord let it be so centered lord upon you i want him to evaluate every part of my life brother sister this is not just things that i preach this is my experience that's right when i'm looking and i i want i want everything to be lined up i want it to be lined up with the word of god and you know what it's not me trying and stressing and this and that but it's yielding to him and let me tell you something through prayer and just feeding on the word there's things that god will bring and he'll mold out and he'll deal with your life as you continue to seek after him he does it he does it let's pray heavenly father lord knowing that god you're mindful of our needs this morning lord you know everyone that's gathered here you know those lord that even whether they're streaming or would be lord of archival later you know lord you know and father we pray god here this morning we ask lord according to your word that lord jesus may your will be so done in our lives lord i pray that god you're just just for every heart that's gathered here lord i you know their need you know right where it's at lord lord i pray may this be a moment for lives if they really don't know you lord maybe they know about the message they know about the prophet they know but they really don't know you may this be lord a moment that that becomes real to them that i need to know the lord jesus and to realize lord it's your desire to know them that's your desire and that's what's greater and it's your desire that's stirring up that desire within them lord may they yield to your presence lord may they yield and say be it unto me lord according to your word lord if it's a pouring out of their heart and their life and just say lord remake me remold me lord oh god come lord and i just surrender my all lord right where they're at oh god just lord a real a surrendering and a pouring out of their heart to you lord

it's the way it is as an assembly oh lord you know lord and i just let the people might understand you know that we're not minimizing lord the word that comes forward here but to recognizing that it's more than just ministering lord but father it's a life to be lived lord it's reaching out lord god it's lord i believe with all my heart sometimes lord that we're not even aware of it we get caught in this veil of time and lord become so occupied with self that lord we lose sight of the purpose of what you've called us and placed us here for lord i pray that god help every one of us lord may lord that lord as we leave even this service this morning there would be such a stirrup on our hearts that lord would cause everyone lord as they would enter into their prayer closet this week and say lord just teach me lord show me lord god direct me lord in my footsteps lord that in my life that lord i want to be a channel of blessing lord not that not that i would be highlighted but i want lord what you are what you've done for me i just want to be a channel like like a microphone that's used in church it's not that microphone it only is a channel that allows that voice to come through lord this is our desire lord and i pray god throughout this building may we lord no matter how old we are how young we are it doesn't matter lord that maybe as young men or young ladies are sitting here and

don't feel like updating it some i don't know what's gonna happen i don't know what's gonna happen you know i might look at this other app date and other you know it says well if you update right here you know they'll be able to see your face through a mask i might say i don't pertain to me but there's also parts i know when it comes to apple i don't know about android but apple there's stuff in there with security stuff that it does it's good you know what it takes sometimes it takes like 15 minutes see we got a fast internet connection we're like do you need me to help you hurry it up and
