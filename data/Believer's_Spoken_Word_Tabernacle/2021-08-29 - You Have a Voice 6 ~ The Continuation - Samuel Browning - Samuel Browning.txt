cold [Music] [Music] is [Music] is [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] the anchor [Music] amen aren't you grateful for that anchor amen it's an anchor that grips within the veil that no matter what trouble and no matter what goes on it's our stabilizer amen it's more it's more precious to us today than it was before because we see the the effect the reality of the anchor of that life you know theology can never bring that but it's only his life his life will anchor us in the word to where that when we don't know what's going on or which way to turn but we know that god cannot fail that he'll keep every word and every promise and we just stand on that you know it wasn't up to david even though david was he was an expert in swinging the the slingshot he was he was an expert at that he was very good at it but it wasn't it wasn't david that slew goliath it was a supernatural anointing that was upon david that was able to direct that stone to the forehead of the giant it looked like a flesh and blood affair but it wasn't it was spiritual a lot of things we look at sometimes seem like flesh and blood affair but it's not it's spiritual it's spiritual amen we i heard there are different requests that were made many that were made mentioned here and we want to just just continue to remember brother roell in prayer and just been many many great victories along the way and where he is so we just want to continue to keep him in prayer that god will just continue to strengthen him and there also if you would like to give towards this they've they've incurred there's quite a bit of medical expenses that's just been incurred and there's some things we've just already sent over there just for the the week that he's been in there and actually a few weeks and so just if you'd like to contribute to that just put that in the missions box and we'll see that gets directly over there for them um so we just want to continue to remember them in prayer [Music] also remember i know the request that was made known here regarding the the hurricane many of you have known about that that's coming in and there in louisiana and i just just had received a text from brother tim pruitt and them they're not they're not going to be lord willing won't be affected by it but you know there's other there's other places that are that are the southernmost part and so there has been some things that brother tim was talking about they were kind of dealing with some of the covet and things like that so we just want to just remember them in prayer just remember also that that that particular place as we just look to the lord knowing that that that hurricane and that's coming in and we just want to ask for the mercy of god i think many of you probably heard seen clips or whatever more and you just see just the just the mess catastrophe over there in afghanistan i tell you what a shame i don't know how to say what a shame and i just my heart is just my heart's been so heavy because you know just to see you know in the case that where you have lives that are just left and you know there's many that are standing there i don't know any message believers there's a lot of things that some as far as with brothers we're just kind of just contacting around in that but there's there's others who are walking in what light that they do have there's some that are leaving and there's others that are they're going to stay because they've made a declaration i want you to think of this they made a declaration to stay many of them because they said how else can the light be spread i'll tell you friends you have these are examples and situations of individuals that it's deadly for them to come out of their homes but they've come into contact with the measure of light that they have to be able to stand and be a witness say may god help us because right here we've got it easy we have got it easy sure we've got battles we've got temptations we've got things all around but there's not one of us that had to go outside of our house today and worry is there somebody watching us or do they have us on a are we on the you know notorious hit list or no we're not on that but what grace has given to i believe i believe there's such an accountability to us may we just put everything we have into it amen for the opportunity god's given us in this hour and i would just ask you just to keep continue to keep just even that that situation in prayer as well god just be merciful uh i just i think it's just been a lot on my heart and i've thought about that i've talked about it with our family just even devotion i said i just it's just very heavy to me it's very very heavy when i see that and so but we know we do know this reality this world is not our home and we know that soon and very soon amen the kingdoms of this world will become the kingdoms amen of the lord and his christ amen that we we shall rule and reign here a thousand years in the preparation then for the future home so we we have everything in the world to look forward to amen so may we you know take the true example and like moses and them stood there when they offered moses and them and said you can go ahead and go moses stood there and said will not leave one behind not one may that be the very issue from our hearts not one behind lord not one behind amen amen you love the lord this morning amen we're just living and really for the world it's very it's a very dark time but this is an awesome time to be serving god it's an awesome time to be serving god amen let's just let's just turn our hearts to the lord if you'd like to stand with me as we go to isaiah 53 and uh i'm just gonna read just a verse of scripture from here and uh i know that this chapter is a very familiar chapter to you and that's it's not i'd love to read the whole chapter i just would ask that you do that maybe sometime in this week but just to draw from this here and this portion and i'm just going to read the first verse and draw from here for a text and to recognize this was a prophecy hundreds of years before where isaiah himself what he would utter would be against his own human senses are you catching me it was against his own human senses this is why he was caught up above his human senses because no human sense reasoning all of those spiritual gates none of them could have ever expressed behold a virgin shall conceive none of them could have expressed what was seen here it had to be the supernatural god that would catch isaiah up isaiah was gifted to be caught up to see this and you know as you read it here in the scripture this is not read in a manner of will be shall be is to come this is mentioned in he was wounded past tense by his stripes we were healed because in the mind of god the lamb was already slain from the foundation of the world this is only the outworking of the word even as it's taking place even right now so verse one let's read let's read this if we could in isaiah 53 verse 1 who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed read that again who hath believed our report i'd like to say this to you that when we have believed the report of the lord it shows itself in the strength in our lives then it's no longer we're not reading this as a letter well isaiah wrote this under the spirit of god but now we say who hath believed our report because the same spirit that moved upon the prophets that caught isaiah up to speak this the same spirit of god that moved and created that that body to come and to dwell in that his own life and then to offer that up for us now that life come back into us then we are identified within this scripture who hath believed our report we don't have a different report is that right paul warned he says you better not have a different gospel it better be the same gospel the same report the same original report amen i'd like to speak to you this morning if the lord would help we're looking at that thought on you have a voice but i want to really narrow it in on and just speak on the continuation the continuation let's bow our heads our word of prayer heavenly father lord we thank you so much for your mercy thank you lord for this this lord awesome moment lord that we are living in in this time lord when we look and we see you dear god just see the very richness of your presence lord just dwelling right among us lord and moving and vindicating yourself to be the same what a peace and what a joy lord your presence oh god in our lives it brings to us oh god lord we thank you father that while there is darkness all around us a darkness as the bible said that can be felt but we're grateful that there's light in our dwellings lord father that's a work of your grace lord that's not anything that we had anything to do with that's just the unmerited grace of god and lord we just pray this morning that you would come lord for each one of these needs lord even many needs that we've mentioned lord lord needs and things that's just so lord heavy on our heart lord we pray that god that you'll just lord move in a very special way o god and father just minister to each of those needs each of those lives lord i pray that god that you'll just now come through your word and just speak to our hearts in a very personal way this morning we need to hear from you lord i pray that god it will not be the voice of a man that we would hear because that could help no one but may it be your voice lord jesus that god will just come and speak to our hearts we pray we love you and thank you now lord in the name of jesus christ amen and god bless you as you're being seated this this very this very word and very term who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed brother brown would just say it just as simple as this in god hiding and revealing in simplicity and he would just say it to believe the report is the evidence that the arm of the lord has been revealed because the arm of the lord is the very strength and the might of almighty god and so we realize that and you you think many times there is a personifying in the scriptures it will say the hand of the lord the arm of the lord and on and on it speaks of god's dealing with man and god becoming present god condescending god coming down and we know that it was necessary that god himself would come in such a manner in order to impart his strength and his life into you and i and so when we we look at this i want to bring into the scripture that we're familiar with in hebrews 13 8 where the scripture says jesus christ is the same yesterday and today and forever that that scripture is not just something that we see on a tape case it's not just to be a scripture that we know and can recite and finish the rest of it but it's to be a living expression it's it's to be a living reality in and through our lives he's the same in principle in strength in everything because he's god and he changes not whatever he did he still does today and whatever he's doing today if there's a tomorrow he's going to continue what he's always done when the same conditions are met he's the word and he cannot fail and god hiding in some publicity brother branham says do you know the early christians according to the ancient history of the early church they carried crosses on their backs wherever they went to signify and identify themselves as christians now the catholics claimed that that was them of course they claimed they was the first ones but the catholic church wasn't even organized then but christians packed the cross he said you've heard people say cross back you refer that to catholic it is the real catholic the universal holy ghost church of the world correct we are catholic we are the original catholic the bible believing catholic they are the church catholic the organization we are free from that we are the continuation of the doctrine of the apostles we are the continuation of the baptism of the holy ghost and all the things that the early church stood for and the catholic church has none of them so to see that within it the continuation that we recognize that it's satan's desire was to always to come and to try to break a continuity but god has made a promise in his word then i will restore saith the lord and to recognize that in in this in the time and the hour that we're living in a continuation of something is is the re is when we look at this in the term of the gospel and of the word it is an action or a carrying on this is what continuation it means it's a process of things being content continued on let me just say it like this there are some things that we can look at in our lives that need to be continued and then there's other things that need to be discontinued is that right the spirit of god comes in such a way to deal with our lives in such a manner to not only bring conviction into our lives of things that are not approving of the spirit of god but he also comes to bring strength and deliverance that we might live above that so that it's not us actually overcoming but it now is the spirit of god in us that's already overcome the world that's overcoming the world whatever he's dealing with in our life and so there is the con the continuation and notice how that that here luke when he would write in acts chapter 1. in acts chapter 1 verse 1 the bible says the former treaties have i have i made o falafelus of all that jesus began both to do and teach until the day in which he was taken up after that he through the holy ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen to whom also he showed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs being seen of them 40 days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of god and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from jerusalem but wait for the promise of the father which saith he ye have heard of me for john truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days hence when they were therefore come together they asked of him lord wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to israel and he said unto them it's not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father hath put in his own power but you shall receive power after that the holy ghost is come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me i really want to draw upon that you shall be witnesses unto me he is letting it be known that your life will become a reflection and that which will also be uh the carrying of the true report that when others that are in bondage and others that are enslaved there's gonna be a liberty a power that sounds through your life and it'll be that power sounding in your life that'll make known to the people that liberty has truly come and they themselves can be a partaker of it so we recognize that within this that even as we see this you shall be witnesses unto me not drawing somebody to a church not drawing them to a creed but get them to him you see that's what a real real witness is a real witness is one that desires to bring one into the presence of the lord jesus christ because he's the only one that can change a life there's a lot of things that we could share and give and you know don't do this and don't do that and and the reality of it is is that it has to come about where there comes a change in the nature on the inside to where god moves down to take the want to and the desire of the world that then he moves on the inside and you become united with him in a union amen is that all right not just a good moral person we believe in that i hope you understand what i'm saying it sanctifies our life but the evidence of the holy spirit is you're in the word it's where you're united with the word he's your everything where he is you are ye shall be witness unto me now notice both in jerusalem in judea in samaria you can put your home in there your workplace in there your community in there your street in there and unto the outermost part of the earth you see he's done what he needed to do the lord jesus has done what he needed to do now he's announcing to them that through the power of the holy ghost operating through sons and daughters of god it will bear witness of me in all of the places that i will send you it's with the purpose of drawing lives to himself and the bible said when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up in a cloud received him out of their sight and you see even when you look at that in verse nine if i could just make a few comments just as it comes to me you remember the bible here they were they were standing and they were watching this i mean they've seen a lot of supernatural events their life has been had they have witnessed supernatural after supernatural after supernatural not just not just before the crucifixion but after the crucifixion here they are getting ready to go fishing and he is there on the shore bidding them to come brother braham says every turn of the way here it was there he was it was the supernatural he was showing himself alive and then here as he ascends up there uh as they are gathered there together and notice that when the bible says here they were they were beholding this and they were looking and and they were no longer fearful they were filled with joy but the angels had a message for them the angels let him know that you need to get to jerusalem and you need to receive the promise that he has brought to you the message is great but the message is here for a purpose that we might be filled with the holy spirit are you with me not just to look up on something and say wow my what no it's to get into the place because the message is the call to get under the blood the lord jesus had roles and he had gathered them to the promise they had a sure expectation when they came back to jerusalem it was not a maybe so it was not a hope so they went there with joy the bible says because they knew that the promise that was made that god himself has come to vindicate it and make it real to their hearts that this is for you they went there with joy because they know it's certain let me just say this with every promise of god when it comes to the holy ghost when it comes to healing when it comes to it's a certain promise if you can believe it's certain it's a certain promise there was a call that they must get beneath the blood they had to enter into the life of the holy ghost it was not going to be enough for them just to simply talk about it there would not be enough that they would be able to talk about the lord jesus and you know be able to well we can rehearse when he did this or we did that it was not enough there was no longer it was not enough to talk about the message they had to get beneath it all of those things were a sign to them that your day of freedom is here all of that was a sign your day of liberty is here this is why brother branham could say in the message token and when he preaches the message desperation and he points and he brings the people to a place he said now look the token has been here all along he's the one who's been working all the miracles all the signs everything that you've seen done we've seen it right here before us but now is the time to come under that token that life see it's the call and assembly we've been brought together been drawn to that of the lord jesus christ now to think of this here this this sounding of the acceptable year in the very life as we've looked at this over a number of services where the lord jesus was walking here upon this earth he manifested that this indeed is the acceptable year the spirit of the lord is upon me we've went through that in the scripture he went and they were the sick were healed those were demon possessed they were devils were cast out lives were changed that that their life had had such a bad reputation of like the woman at the well and you know legion he could never get free on and on we could go those who didn't even have eyes eyes were created those who had infirmity in their life here they are they receive strength and woman who has stooped over and doubts she can stand up straight who was that that was doing that that was almighty god in the fulfillment of his word and that word was sounding out in that hour and it was founding a liberty to the hearts and lives of the people according to the word for the scripture said he bore our sicknesses he bore our infirmity here he was standing as the lamb of god that was declared by revelation to take away the sin of the world it was announced that this is the one this is the messiah and here is he standing here within that time he also could announce to the believers in that hour in john 14 12 verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also he wasn't talking about meat baskets fruit baskets cheese and cracker platters he wasn't talking about working down at the local homeless shelter come on now he wasn't talking about all those things those are works of the flesh you can't work your way into the kingdom of god the bible says that we would labor to enter into his rest but it's not our works the labor is us dying to ourselves that's the real labor right there is us coming to a place to no longer love this life above the life that's presented to us that's the real labor that's the victory right there and he made a way that we can come in to that victory and live by that victory as he said he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and greater works than thee shall he do because i go unto my father and whatsoever you ask in my name that will i do that the father may be glorified in the sun notice that the father may be glorified in the son if you shall ask anything in my name i will do it now brother branham brings it like this in the resurrection of jesus in 1956 he said now remember his corporal body is the high priest that's sitting before the throne of god with the blood making intercession his spirit called the holy spirit is here living with us in our spirit doing the same things carrying on the ministry that he started my my mind you see he started this ministry in his own earthly body and he finishes this ministry in the body of believers the bride of jesus christ redemption was started we're reading isaiah 53 but remember there has to be a finishing up of redemption when the last name is called is that right there's only so many names on the lamb's book of life there's no there's no no record in the scripture that names are being compiled right now but what it is is the lamb's book of life it's the word that's being sounded out the character of life that is actually being sounded out that gets the attention of those that are wrote in the lamb's book of life it has a meaning to our life this is why the response the response is not something within us that just well this sounds good or this makes sense it goes much deeper than that it's more than just something that makes sense it becomes a life that you can't explain neither is it something that you're trying to live but now it's christ inside of you living out his own life that's what the real new birth is it's not our struggle to live right no it is a yielding to the life within us are you hearing me that's where the battle's got to get stopped first the war's got to get stopped right there in the soul well i don't do this and i don't do that but if you still have the desire to do it you're still not right god comes down to deal with the desire so we're not living under that part of fear but now the desire within is to completely please him oh my that's what the spirit of god he comes down within our life to continue the same ministry that he started and i just say it like this that ministry never changed that ministry god never intended that that ministry would ever change it's the same ministry it's the ministry of the lord jesus christ and what he did in that earthly body he does in this same body same lord jesus now notice he said and he said i will be with you to the end of the world things that i do shall you also unto the end of the world and he said now to the newcomers find out what he did what did he do did he claim that he was a great healer bring me this man let me show you you how i heal them that wasn't god that wasn't christ no no he said i can do nothing in myself but he said it's not me that doeth the works the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works so then the works would be that of the word being expressed in our life where it's not us trying to live according to the word let me just stop here just for a moment there are things that god can deal with a life no matter where you're at in your journey yes you should want to have your heart inclined to the word but what i'm trying to present you this morning is is that the new birth itself is more than our strength within it because let me tell you something the bible says in isaiah 40 that there is more strength that's needed than our natural strength because it says even the strength of the youth will faint oh if i had a stronger mind and a stronger resolution it's no match for the devil our strength is no match for the devil but his strength is perfect his strength is perfect his strength is what it is in our life that holds as an anchor it's a substance it's a reality it's his strength that moves on the inside of us i can do he says it's not me that doeth the works of the father that dwelleth in me notice the works that are being done is that word that's being expressed out of that life you see when we look at this in mark chapter 16 verse 14. think of those works of the word being expressed through the life you know it's not something where we're looking at the word and i'm trying to do this and i'm really trying to do this but we recognize that it must be christ it must be the living god to fulfill this word in our life it's just like you know as a person as god begins to deal with that life and and they come along there's a portion of the word that then can begin to be expressed through justification sanctification and then on into the baptism of the holy ghost but the works of the word is that of christ expressing his own life through you and i in mark 16 verse 14 notice hear the lord jesus he's gathered them together and he said afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they set at me and abraded them with with their unbelief and hardness of heart because they believed not which had seen him after he was risen and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature brother ramble pick it up over and over he said he didn't say teach he said preach because the preaching is the demonstration of the power of god that'll move down into a life to bring real conviction and god will demonstrate himself in his word go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up servants and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so then after the lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sat down on the right hand of god and they went forth and preached everywhere the lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following amen here here is the living god that has come down he's paid the price and now has send it up and we understand as believers we're not talking about a right hand like somebody has a right hand we're talking about power he said all power in heaven and earth is given unto me amen there's nothing above him there's nothing greater than him you know there's no circumstance no situation that's greater than jesus nothing is bigger than him he he he descended to the lower most parts of hell and he deposited sin and every accusation that can ever be laid upon you he deposited it right there in hell and he rose up on that easter morning and he had presented himself as the sacrifice there before the father and then he came back and he begins to gather there of his children and begins to rehearse the promise to them and then as they are receiving of that promise now it is the same god now dwelling in a mini-membered body satan thought he had problems when he was here remember he said i thought i had you when when when the lord jesus here descending there down into hell remember satan said i thought i had you when i got abel thought i had you when i got ezekiel why why did he think he had him because it was the spirit of christ in every one of them but jesus was the fullness of the godhead bodily it was not a part it was not a portion it was the very fullness of god himself come down it didn't take away from jeremiah didn't take away from ezekiel but his coming it further identified that their position of where they were all along they were standing in the sacrifice in their day in their age and he came at that appointed time and remember the same one where that that satan thought i had him i thought i've got him but now he says now i've got you but what satan failed to recognize is you're not just dealing with a man that has been born under sexual desire this blood did not come from sexual desire this is the blood of god that's why brother branham would drive it in in the very first part of the revelation of jesus christ and he would drive it in and he would say it so clearly he said it is the blood of god the blood of the lord the blood of christ he said don't let anybody tell you he's a second person or a third person or he's not god he said jesus is god because it's the blood that we are saved by if the prophet took that much time within that point and he would have strictly adjure you and i he says now that you've been delivered from that don't ever let anybody drag you back into creeds and traditions and dogmas of man again don't ever let that happen the blood makes us free men and women the blood pays the price for you and i that blood was shed that he could announce to satan when he showed up there in hell he could say my blood that is purchased everything is still hot upon the ground everything has been paid off every debt every lien you know what he was declaring that there is not one thing though the devil could try to say you've done this and you've done that you might have done that you might still be living in that but there's a blood right has already spoken that says i've already paid the price don't let the devil hold it over your head any longer what do i do receive your liberty amen that's why the whole report is the report of a finished work hallelujah jesus christ as he stood there oh my has here the son of almighty god standing there as a representation of all the adam lost in the fall has been restored i want you to listen to this this statement in the revelation of jesus christ brother braham said now i want you to remember this christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts this is important christ in in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts but the book of revelation shows how that the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and powerless it exposes satan revealing his works his attempted destruction of god's people and the discrediting of god's word right down to the time he's cast into the lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand that he's trying to do what discredit the report satan is in opposition against the report he knows this is what satan knows satan's not a dummy he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for and that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit satan will be powerless before her he will be as definitely thwarted today as when christ withstood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes satan hates revelation but we love it with true revelation in our lives the gates of hell cannot prevail against us but we will prevail over them what is it that prevails it's his strength it's the revelation of jesus christ in our lives that's prevailing no matter what test comes your way no matter what trial comes your way no matter what situation comes your way listen they tried to boil the holy ghost out of john they put him in a vat they put him in the isle of patmos come on somebody you talk about oh i gotta have the right circumstance to serve god quit being a weakling and a yellow belly and just man up to the gospel and say jesus christ i need a real death in my life i need a real visitation because we're talking about men and women down through the scriptures they didn't have an easy path to hold it wasn't something that was just like everything rolled out for them they stood there with a ruggedness of faith they stood there because it was not their own strength it was the strength of almighty god we're going to stand in the presence someday of individuals like that let me just tell you something in standing in their presence you will see individuals that you'll say my they were weak but they were weak and earthly strength but the strength of god is what was on display in their lives are you with me amen because the reality is i don't want to stand there and say you know what if things would have been easier in 2020 and 2021 steve and i have stood like used to it nope come on friend we ain't going to stand there like that we're going to stand there like that it's standing there in the matter pressures and things come about our life but when it's just like in a marriage you don't enter into a marriage and think about oh my this guy might get ugly i mean she might get plump this might happen or that might happen if you're doing that you're thinking the wrong kind of thoughts you know that we are aware there might be tests and trials that will come down the road there are situations that will change but in the midst of that time your love grows greater because you didn't marry flesh you marry the character are you hearing me now we're talking about the lord jesus christ if all you can do is look at it and say all the hardships and i don't know if i can do this and i don't know if i can do that you need to fall in love with the lord jesus you're too in love with yourself oh lord if you ever fall in love with him you'll lose sight of yourself i'm talking about christ coming into the true church we can't put christ on and take him off put him on thursday take him off on friday put him on on sunday take him off on monday it's christ that is on display in the true church of the living god amen i tell you friends when we look at it that way you might look at your life and feel like well i don't feel like i've done much or i don't feel like i've done this or or whatever more but you look at your constancy constant standing upon the word of god standing there believing the word of god through thick and thin no matter if all hell breaks around breaks loose around you you're still standing there are you hearing me i'm talking about a strength i'm talking about the arm of the lord that you realize it's not i that's living it's christ that liveth in me glory be to god something that gives you strength to get up the next morning amen oh my so this continuation it's the same lord jesus working through a mini membered body now i want you just to look at this here because when we take look here in the message the token brother brahma is dealing with this and he takes an awful lot of time as you know uh especially there in the message in jeffersonville that if you haven't listened to the message the token preaching 63 of september 1st i i would really encourage you to go back and listen to it again and if you just listen to it listen to it again there's a lot i'm drawing from here brother brahma goes back and i did goes back to exodus 12 and he remember where they were to take a lamb ever all the way through all the way through the scripture it is the innocent sacrifice that's provided for the guilty they did not provide for their own guilt when things when the fall took place in eden god slew an innocent one and threw the clothing so that they could come under that those garments and come in his presence all the way through it's been the sacrifice of an innocent one for the guilty and there in exodus 12 he said take the lamb slay the lamb and you take the blood and you put the blood upon the lentils of the doorpost now see everybody walking by that house knew that that home was under the blood is that because there was no guess like i wonder if the blood it was right there on the doorpost amen is that right it wasn't a guest they they had to apply it they had to do that moses gave the message god gave to moses but they had to take that message then they had to apply it there's only one way to escape the judgment you've got to apply it is that right now notice he's talking back to that time he says now a blood identified the believer so when they could come by the door oh there there's a believer how do you know because the blood's on the door so it identified the believer because the life had gone out and could not come back so he had to have a chemistry he had to have like a paint a blood a chemistry that showed that life went out see how god would start with that of the blood because there had to be the blood provided to pay the ransom before the life could ever come now notice this he says now he had to have like a paint a blood a chemistry that showed that life went from it now the very spirit itself is the token the holy spirit itself is the token not the blood the blood was shed at calvary that's true but the blood as far as it is went back into the elements from which it came from the food that he lived on but you see inside that blood cell was a life that started the blood cell to moving the chemistry had no life in it itself and therefore it could not move but when the life come into the chemistry of the blood it formed a cell it formed its own cell then cell after cell then it become a man and that man was god emmanuel in flesh but when the life returned back the chemistry went out now notice he says but the token is the holy ghost upon the church that they see christ that they see christ so we're not walking around upon our lives and now i've got blood smeared upon me no it's the chemistry went back to the earth the chemistry that blood was the ransom he had to remember the bible in isaiah 53 he shall make his soul and offering for sin everything was settled right there there had to be a payment a ransom made and the debt was settled is that right now the same holy spirit that lived and formed that blood cells the same god that was there in that body is the same god that then came into his earthly body body of believers and begins to sound out the same liberty they see christ oh i love that mama it has to be because a woman and her husband become one they become one and so does the bride and christ become one the ministry of the bride and the ministry of christ is the same if there's any difference it's not the ministry of the bride and it's not the ministry of jesus christ it cannot change at all now remember he refers back to acts 1 1. these former treaties of theophilus have i wrote to you that jesus began to begin to do and continues to do his death didn't stop him no sir he returned again not a third person but the same person returned again in the form of the holy ghost and to continue the work on and continues on said the book of acts jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever that's the token that's the sign amen it's the same god moved back into an earthly body the same person returned in the form of the holy ghost to continue the work out now notice to continue the work on and continues on said the book of acts now in first corinthians 12 12 for as the body is one and half many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is christ remember he said upon this rock i will build my church not peter he couldn't build his church on the shifting sands of man he can't build it upon the sexual birth he only builds his church by that of the new birth by that of himself coming in and bringing out in our lives what is always there for as the body is one and half many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is christ for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body oh my i love that you see their their takes uh as far as the brothers we sit here by our own strength and put people down in the water and bring them up there's not one person there's not one man nobody can baptize somebody into christ this is a work of baptism that he does personally it's a personal experience and this baptism is not like this because here a person can be baptized right here and you know maybe they don't go on they come they go in the water and they come up our lord showing a clear conscience towards god but when you are baptized by the spirit of god you're no longer the same person you see we're talking about something different than just an anointing we're talking about the holy ghost that comes upon that word that makes that word live where our life begins to dovetail with the word is that right for by one spirit we are all baptized into one body let me just as it's coming to my mind you know the word baptized there i like how the uh many of you heard this many many times but it's like you take the example that they'll give in this word is like you take a cucumber how many of you like pickles man i like them not sweet ones but i like deals that was opinion that one does sayeth the lord that's just so you understand that but i've never taken a cucumber and said i want a pickle on my hamburger and took that cucumber and cut it up it's not a pickle are you hearing me i don't want it i want a pickle well brother sammy you know what a pickle is no it's not a pickle is a pickle it once was a cucumber but once it's gone through the hot water still is a cucumber is that right it's been baptized in that hot water still a cucumber whoa can come out of the hot water still a cucumber but once it goes into the vinegar once it goes into the solution it changes it it's no longer a cucumber it's a pickle never can be a cucumber again that's what the genuine baptism on the holy ghost does it doesn't leave you of the world it changes your life forever that's why we are new creatures in christ jesus for the body is not one member but many notice he talking about the body now when you look at this how brother rams ask this question the question answers on the seals and i want to get to to a place here he said is the bride of christ and the body of christ the same good question is the bride of christ and the body of christ the same he said yes sir now brother brad said you know i don't want to get started well i'll start preaching a sermon on this but i want to show you when god gave adam his bride from his side he said she is flesh of my flesh and bone of my bone when god give christ his bride look at these words when god give christ his bride the spirit gave the flesh the bride so it's the spirit of god that has went forth to deal with our life call us to repentance that's that's a work of the holy ghost and then the holy spirit works in our life to do what brings sanctification is that right then the same spirit of god works in our life to come into a place of complete death now he steps in to unite with that seed that was there all along amen what's the what's done that the spirit so now it's not listen to me now the flesh itself the flesh itself only becomes the visible the visible part to declare that the invisible god is there so the flesh is only declares the amorphy of god where has god in morphed at god sets down in that of the seed the seed is quickened we were dead this is why brother baby tells us he says that soul that come from god that's the real gift because it's that that receives you see it receives the life of god god does not come down and clean up our old nature and say you know what i'm gonna make mark a good guy then i'll come and unite with him you can't make mark a good guy i don't care how you beautify him up richie samuel dave paul any of you i won't call sister's name because i want things to be good but you understand you can't beautify it up good enough for jesus to say yep it's good enough it has to come to a place of death to where it dies to that old nature and then that seed that's been laying there dormant the whole time lacking genesis 1 underneath the darkness and void and then he comes by his spirit and he raises up that life on the inside and you can say i am a new creation in christ jesus because he unites with his word what is his word himself he comes to unite with himself [Applause] what did that the spirit presents christ his bride so this is why that even on our natural body my hands are to glorify him even my earthly body is to be yielded as members to in righteousness is that right things that maybe you know used to come out of here even things sometimes they enter their and you say man i'm going to tell son and all of a sudden here the spirit of god are raised why because you are bought with a price you're not your own you are on the slave market come on we were a slave to sin but there's one who came and he bought us from the market took us out of the market and the spirit of god places us in him you can never be sold into slavery again [Applause] you're free the spirit of god it presents the bride so the bride is not the work of a church it takes the spirit of god he's the one assembling the many members of his body now not every member is the same feet hands on and on we can go no we know that in our own body but yet each one has its peculiarities god has set them in there particularly everything is to declare him my hand does not work against my body is that right my arm does not look over and say you know what you used me so much here you were out here the shovel you didn't use this guy you use the left one hear the right one lifting all this something lifting bricks up and everything else huh see this guy he can't go over there and say ah i'm not going with you tomorrow if he's part of my body he's going to go with me come on somebody you see when we've been baptized into the body of jesus christ the spirit brings us into a harmony we're not our own brother simon it's like you know i ever look at your hands and things like that sometimes you got certain toes that are crooked or certain fingers that are crooked man i can just straighten that thing out or maybe you got a nose that you want to reduce in size or you got something else or what i want to do this or i want to do that or i've done but you know what everything is placed there for a purpose and we need one another let me just be very very clear there might be things that well this is a little crooked or that's a little crooked that we need the christ in one another did you hear what i said we need the christ in one another we don't need everybody to be the same we don't need everybody to be brother joey or everybody to be brother we don't need that god don't want that we need the christ in one another now notice what jesus had said here in john 17 20 i want you to watch this this ministry here of the bride jesus said in john 17 20 neither pray i for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through their word so this same word of liberty this same report is going to be sounding out through a body amen here he is intercessory prayer i'm not just praying for them but for those who will believe on their word that they may be one notice what this prayer is that they may be one as thou father see this is not a oneness that spoke of like well the pentecostals get together with the baptist and no no no that's ecumenical that's that's carnality of man this is the oneness that jesus spoke about that they all may be one as thou father art in me and i in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou hast sent me and the glory which thou gavest me i have given them and that they may be one even as we are one i in them and thou in me that they may be made perfect in one and that the world look how it goes again that the world may know that thou has sent me and has loved them as thou hast loved me our lives he prayed for this oneness for that same life to be inside of you and i that what would that do that would vindicate that indeed that jesus christ is lord it would be it would be a declaration in our life you see it's more than just words it's what our life gives a testimony of where people ask and say hey where do you go to church at and you realize hey it's more than just church sure you want to bring you want them to come to a place where they can really hear the gospel not here uh follow these five steps to be a better you or or you know no you want to do where they come to a place to meet the lord jesus that they receive that same victory in their life you want them to meet the one that you've met and has changed your life and what better an example what better life than one who's a true witness it declares in our life that he is lord it declares that indeed he was a sacrifice our life declares that liberty that freedom that we live by now here peter let me just skip to a place here in acts chapter 2 i had the whole chapter but i've just i'll just move through a certain place here is peter he begins to sound out on the day of pentecost god coming to honor his word when the bible says when the day of pentecost was fully come i want you to think of this there were the bible says there were devout jews gathered from all nations to jerusalem what did they come there for the feast of pentecost what you think about this some of them gathered there under a form there were others gathering that day in an expectation for it to move from a type to the antitype to the real thing are you with me here they were all the jews there were jews from every nation how how god had it so fit in that hour jews that they those that this was their native language this was their native land and this was their pamphlet all those things that you can read in the scripture but when the holy ghost came the bible says it filled the not only the house where they were sitting but a cloven tongue of fire each of them received a lick of fire received a portion of god's own life and it sat upon them oh my there wasn't going to be a leaving it sat upon them it came to make alive the word and the promise they were now witnesses of the resurrection not by just what they had seen with their eyes but now in their own lives there was a witness that i was once dead but now i've been quickened my life has been changed completely that revelation of jesus christ was so deep in their life to where now when peter steps out there and all of these jews are gathered around he begins to declare to them from the scripture notice where the spirit of god took them are you hearing me the spirit of god didn't take him to a feeling we believe in feelings are you with me but he didn't take him to a well i know this is this because of this feeling no no no what happened to him brought him right into the word because it was a word experience come on friends a real genuine holy ghost experience will never deny the word it'll never back up from the word it'll never make excuses around the word but a real true baptism of the holy ghost unites us with jesus christ in the same ministry of his power and glory [Applause] the spirit of god raised up in them just like it did when jesus said the spirit of the lord is upon me peter was declaring in that time what you're wondering about and you're wondering are they drunk but i want to let you know this is that which joe prophesied what authority did he have he had authority from on high he was declaring the report of the lord the rest of them here they are what did they say man we know these are all galileans why their dialect betrayed them is that right just like somebody you know how y'all their dialect betrays them man or somebody they want some water or some quarter or your dialect betrays you you're with me you betrayed where you're from their dialect betrayed them as galileans but remember it was not that of a galilean voice it was that of god's voice sounding throughout their lives they weren't speaking in a different tongue they were speaking in their own tongue but the spirit of god was interpreting in their hearing how hear we every man in our own tongue the miracle wasn't the speaking the miracle was the hearing when the priests rode the land in the jubilee the miracle wasn't the sounding the miracle was the hearing where those who were bound could hear this is my liberty this is my freedom let him not happen here hear what the spirit said to the church glory be to god they identify these wonderful works of god that are being expressed we hear them we we hear the wonderful works of almighty god oh man i think of how that peter oh i love how the bible speaks of how he lifted up his voice and i just got to keep on going but peter comes into this place in acts 2 29 and i must read this one to you he said men and brethren let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch david that he is both dead and buried and his sepulcher is with us today therefore being a prophet and knowing that god has sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his loins according to the flesh he would raise up christ to sit on his throne he's seeing this before spake of the resurrection of christ that his soul was not left in hell neither his flesh did see corruption let me just say what did this this one let me tell you who's the one speaking here earthly speaking this man couldn't read his name on a boxcar are you hearing me this is not the intellect of peter lining up prophecies it's the spirit of god oh brother saying i don't understand this i don't understand that don't let the devil waste your time trying to get you around i don't understand this don't understand that but do exactly what the prophet said pray for revelation it's not our natural mind that makes sense of it it takes the spirit of god who directed peter to the word the spirit of god directed him to the word hallelujah there's men are you with me the pharisees those men knew the prophecies and yet they could look at a prophecy being fulfilled and call it bl's above you're a samaritan that has a devil it showed that learning and intellect and reading and theology will never be what god accepts i'll tell you this it brings it down to this right here it wouldn't matter if you're that if you're illiterate it wouldn't matter if you can't read it wouldn't matter nothing like that at all what it comes down to it takes the holy spirit of god to come and to reveal himself to you in the word oh it takes it away from a church it puts it back into the hands of the lamb of almighty god i tell you that ought to change the way that we pray about things it changes the way we try to go about handling things it's not us brother and sister but let's look to the god who can direct in the word who fulfills his word who brings his word to pass let's invite him the arm of the lord to break every power to shatter every chain to deliver all the oppressed amen to loosen our children [Applause] are you with me this morning hallelujah and here's what peter could say this jesus hath god raised up whereof we all are witnesses therefore being by the right hand of god exalted and having received of the father the promise of the holy ghost he hath shed forth this which ye now see and here what was it the report the same life that lived in the earthen tabernacle the creation of god now that same life lives in the continuation of the creation of god lives that are created anew by the holy ghost you might say as a sister my i don't seem like i can put the word together and seem like i can do this and do that don't don't don't busy yourself with that even as a brother well i don't know if i can don't busy yourself with that what do i busy myself just say lord let my life be such an example let my life be a place that you can display yourself because it people are not after doctrine they want reality they want to know the lord jesus christ the one who can take their life and transform it people are tired of church they don't want church i don't blame them i don't want church either we want the lord jesus christ he's more than life to us hallelujah and peter could say he could say in this manner when they it was done speaking in verse 37 when they heard this they were pricked in their heart see the the word proclaiming liberty it identified the condition they were in by making them known this is what god intends you to be it brought conviction to their heart and here's what they asked what shall we do peter gave the great prescription repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are far off even as many as the lord are god's call and with many other words did he testify and exhort saying save yourselves from this upward generation then they that gladly received his word were baptized and the same they were added unto them about three thousand souls the word went forth not all responded as a matter of fact some of them they mocked them they laughed at them but there were others that when the word was sounding out it pricked their heart it dealt with their heart you see this is what the spirit of god does it deals with our heart it doesn't come by look he's not the spirit of god's not a condemning spirit but he comes to let you and i know you can be free and not you can be but it's to tell you you're free it's to accept what the liberty in christ jesus to accept that liberty and he announces that there they were moved you see this is why it takes the spirit of god just moving throughout the life you live the ministering of the word as it goes forth all of these parts is to bring about that pricking of the heart the conviction because if a man is never convicted he's wrong he can never get right is that right this is why the scripture said that the backslider is right in all of his ways right in his ways his own ways he justifies everything he's got everything's right this is right this is right this is right this is right this is wrong this all those things but when a man has come in contact with god and it can see his life to see where it's at and what god has called him to be and then can accept it can accept and just literally just like i have this handkerchief here you let go of sin just like that how do i let go of it repentance it's like real true repentance is dying out to self amen then the promise is sure it's always been sure you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost think of that same report that same report sounds out right here this morning many you know i think of when brother brother dave junior stood up here a couple weeks ago and gave the testimony regarding his mom sister shirley and brother dave has given testimony each each time but some of the things you don't you know you don't even realize that people sometimes are all together going through you don't realize as they as they've been sitting here sitting here is probably many many of us i know this that for many of the servers before it was sitting here in pain all sorts of discomfort not just for days now this isn't lifting sister shirley up but i'm just talking to you about the caliber and the quality of the life that's there are you hearing me we're talking about but it goes throughout this assembly when i i could right now it could stand right now and say if you if god has touched your body and healed you stand to your feet there's no doubt throughout this building right here i don't think there'd be one sitting down what is that that's a witness of the report i could ask in this building how many have received the holy ghost could stand and be as a testimony that my life has been changed and i am united with jesus christ i'm no longer the same person amen my life has been changed what is it it's a witness of the report somebody's been delivered and they can stand and say i once i once was bound but now i'm free what is it it's a witness of the report now let me just say that that witness of the report in lives throughout this building is something to bring courage to each and every one no matter where you're at in your journey i want you to understand that there is no flesh in this building that is greater than another flesh there's not one person here that's greater than another person there's only one great one among us and that's the lord jesus christ and simply put what he did for others he'll do for you he's the same yesterday today and forever that's why you can pray for your children and have the confidence that the same god that changed me because you knew five steps to a better you wouldn't change you who changed you the lord jesus so your confidence is lord the same one you're the same god who changed my life you're the same god to get a hold of my children you're the same god to get a hold of a husband or wife or you're the same god what's your confidence in is the work of the report in your own life amen press on let's pray heavenly father dear god we realize lord as we stand here lord in these moments oh god to be a partaker of your life lord of the liberty and the freedom from condemnation lord of freedom from lord the dominion of sin lord jesus as paul would write of it lord we are your workmanship we're not our own lord we've been bought with a price the continuation it's you it's you lord continuing your work your life your purpose through our lives lord father help us lord help us to get out of the way help us lord to just be healed even more so [Music] surrender to you lord lord i know that across this building there's needs upon hearts lord from the request that i heard before service and i know that even beyond those requests that are placed here lord there's there's burdens there's cares there's needs lord now father we just ask lord god that you had just moved down lord god on behalf of each one of those needs just speak lord to every heart lord and i pray that god throughout this building lord jesus the report that it rings out lord through our life god may it be lord a real witness for that's what it's called to be the life is a witness of the liberty in christ jesus lord if there's one heart here this morning that doesn't know you in that way father i pray that god while in the sweetness of your presence that god they would be just drawn to a place of surrender they'd like to make that consecration to you really lord from the depths of their heart to be united with you fully i pray that god knowing that lord when a heart has repented when a heart lord has walked o god into your word lord jesus as you said when we repent and are baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ shall receive the gift of the holy ghost because lord that's the desire is to be united with you lord [Music] we're not here because we were looking for a church we're here because of you [Music] because of you lord to be united with you father that lord where you are that's where we want to be lord lord i pray this morning god let the simplicity the simplicity of the gospel just move to that place in the very depths lord of each and every life lord those are some that are suffering lord are sick in their body not just not just here but lord and others lord around the world god we think of brother o'ell and we ask lord that the same angel the lord had just continued to move lord over every part of our brother lord father from the lungs to the kidneys lord heart every part lord of his being granted lord we we believe in a complete a complete work lord we're standing lord for that lord we thank you father for touching brother bill lord the strength oh god lord just moving lord for his need thank you for moving lord god for the needs of your children lord that's gathered here lord and i pray that god for any lord that might be in their body lord that is suffering this morning the lord would take that promise and to know that you are our high priest the lord by your stripes we are healed we believe that lord father we stand upon that word and we ask oh god the same holy spirit lord just moving down lord to bring our body in subjection to our confession lord we pray granted lord we love you lord this morning dear god [Music] in the name of jesus christ will be worth it when we see jesus [Music] they'll seem so small when we see christ [Music] [Applause] so [Music] oh when we see jesus [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] glimpse

[Music] let's see that he's alive and well amen would you like to stand with me amen he's alive and well living in me to tell the world that he's still the same amen it all it's what it all boils down to is that it's the life of jesus christ on display in our lives when the spirit of truth has come he'll lead and guide us into all truth he guides us into into all truth he directs us just just as he came drew the disciples who were wandering they were kind of going their own way but here he came as the great shepherd and he began to gather him up and then he began to make known the promise to him and then as he made known the promise to him here they are gathered in to christ it was him drawing his children together so then their lives remember when they would look at even see peter in them the bible said they took knowledge they were ignorant and unlearned is that right they could look at them and say these are ignorant and unlearned men but they took knowledge they had been with jesus his life was so impressed upon their life until they knew they've been with jesus [Music] it just there's a difference he makes in our life can you say amen he's the one who makes the difference just as the spirit of truth guided them into the promise then look what had happened as we seen here in the scriptures it guides them right into identifying what took place was joel 2. what david spoke by the spirit of god this is what is taking place see the spirit of truth guided them into all truth amen this is what the same holy spirit that's what it does in me and you it guides us into all truth is that right it guides us into the word and we can look and see the word coming to pass in our own life sometimes it's hard to see but then sometimes you get alone with god in prayer and you can you see things in your life you know you're not the same but then you see things that god will point out sometimes in prayer some things you're praying about and god makes known to you this is what was taken place in your life it's me that's holding you it's me my victory coming through your life and then lord hear the very thing i'm praying about is coming to pass but you know it happens so simply it happens in our life and it's not something that we're aware of that it when it's happening but after it happens he makes it known it's jesus he's alive and well oh he's alive and well living in me to tell the world that he's still the same he's the same yesterday [Applause] [Music] jesus is alive and well [Music] [Applause] [Music] he's the same yesterday [Music] is more time oh he's alive and well living in me to tell he's the same yesterday [Applause] one more time one more time oh he's alive [Music] [Applause] [Music] the world [Music] that he's still the same for he's the same yesterday and forever [Music] [Music] making a difference in my in my life [Music] [Music] is [Applause] [Music] making a [Music] a difference [Music] [Applause] in my life [Music] [Music] hallelujah [Music] oh
