[44:15] of that in prayer and um how many
[44:18] enjoyed the fellowship on that was able
[44:20] to be here on on Sunday man that was
[44:23] good wasn't it that was really good it
[44:25] would have been better with hot dogs but
[44:27] it was good
[44:30] minus the nitrate hot dogs it had been
[44:33] good with with hot dogs
[44:36] but uh uh we just we we thank God for
[44:41] that and I I'm just grateful because it
[44:43] wasn't a big thing to have to clean up
[44:45] and I just appreciate brother Shane
[44:46] putting all that together and you know
[44:48] building the the fire pit and doing all
[44:50] that and it just was a it was a great
[44:52] time and so Lord willing the calendar
[44:54] will be coming out for October and we'll
[44:57] have another one there in October a
[44:59] weather permitting so
[45:01] let's look here in the word of the Lord
[45:03] I don't I'm sorry I don't mean to just
[45:05] keep you standing I just wanted to go
[45:06] over those things I hope you remember
[45:09] them but uh
[45:11] Job chapter 1 verse 13.
[45:14] I want to cut in on this part of it
[45:17] um where Satan has
[45:21] has received permission from God and God
[45:25] has has pulled back the Hedge
[45:28] around job's life
[45:30] uh with all things that are around his
[45:34] life and Satan's not coming in this
[45:36] moment to touch his body or to afflict
[45:39] his body he's just going to touch what's
[45:40] around him and he's got permission to do
[45:43] that because Satan can't do that until
[45:45] he first gets permission
[45:47] we we hear these things and we've heard
[45:50] them over the years and it's very true
[45:52] that Satan can't do one thing unless he
[45:56] first gets permission from God
[45:59] and that's a real rest to a believer
[46:02] because in the midst of that time when
[46:05] everything's going on that we can't
[46:06] explain we know that wait a minute here
[46:09] God's in control
[46:10] I might feel like things are out of
[46:12] control but God's got it in control
[46:15] and he who's in control has me
[46:19] so verse 13 and there was a day when
[46:21] when his sons and his daughters were
[46:23] eating and drinking wine in their eldest
[46:25] brother's house and there came a
[46:27] messenger unto job and said the ox were
[46:29] plowing and the asses feeding beside
[46:31] them and the sabians fell upon them and
[46:34] took them away yea they have slain the
[46:38] servants with the edge of the sword and
[46:41] I only am escaped
[46:44] alone to tell thee and while he was yet
[46:47] speaking there came also another and
[46:50] said the fire of God has fallen from
[46:52] heaven and hath burned up the sheep and
[46:55] the servants and consumed them and I
[46:59] only am escaped alone to tell thee while
[47:03] he was yet speaking there came also
[47:06] another and said the Chaldeans made out
[47:09] three bands and fell up on the camels
[47:12] and have carried them away yea and slain
[47:15] the servants with the edge of the sword
[47:17] and I only am escaped alone to tell thee
[47:21] and while he was yet speaking there came
[47:23] also another and said thy sons and thy
[47:27] daughters were eating and drinking wine
[47:28] in their eldest brother's house and
[47:31] behold there came a great win from the
[47:33] Wilderness and smote the four corners of
[47:36] the house and it fell upon the young men
[47:38] and they are dead and I only am escaped
[47:42] alone to tell thee let me just stop here
[47:45] just for a moment
[47:47] how many knows that when you have you go
[47:49] to file an insurance claim if lightning
[47:51] strikes your house they call that an act
[47:53] of God
[47:55] that's the biggest lie there is
[47:58] it's not there's not an act of God God
[48:00] is not in destruction
[48:04] are you hearing me God's not in
[48:06] destruction so we recognize that these
[48:08] things even when brother Bram talks
[48:10] about that wind we were looking around
[48:12] on Sunday came up where where Satan blew
[48:15] his poison breath the waters were only
[48:18] responding to that poisoned breath of
[48:20] Satan and Satan's desire was to try to
[48:23] drown the disciples but Jesus came to
[48:26] them
[48:26] so when we we look at this we know that
[48:29] here are the things that are taking
[48:31] place and I can't help as I read through
[48:33] this we hear the phrase if you haven't
[48:35] you stick around uh Hillbillies long
[48:38] enough you'll know it and that is when
[48:39] it rains it pours
[48:41] sometimes they'll say it's raining cats
[48:43] and dogs you know it just it just seems
[48:45] like it just keeps coming and this is
[48:46] what's happening with job it just keeps
[48:48] coming One messenger after another you
[48:50] finally wonder if job didn't want to say
[48:51] I'm not even going to look out that
[48:53] window
[48:55] I'm not even going to answer the door
[48:57] let's not even answer the phone
[49:00] verse 20. then job arose
[49:04] and rent his mantle and shaved his head
[49:06] and this is what I want you to
[49:07] concentrate on these verses and he fell
[49:09] down upon the ground and worshiped
[49:12] and he said naked came I out of my
[49:15] mother's womb and naked shall I return
[49:16] thither the lord gave and the Lord hath
[49:20] taken away
[49:21] blessed be the name of the Lord
[49:25] in all this job sinner
[49:28] nor charged God foolish
[49:32] God will help us I'd like to speak a
[49:35] little thought on appropriate response
[49:39] may God bless you bless the reading of
[49:41] the word as you're being seated
[49:43] I realize that when this
[49:47] looking at this here over
[49:50] the past
[49:51] few weeks and just with
[49:54] really just the thoughts of where we've
[49:56] been dealing with on purpose and passing
[49:58] and some of that that's really the file
[50:01] I've been working out of and when I got
[50:03] to looking at this this struck my heart
[50:06] and just kept coming at times in prayer
[50:08] and then even as I was praying here and
[50:10] just waiting on the Lord and I want you
[50:12] to understand when I we take this child
[50:15] title of appropriate response
[50:19] it's God's desire in every service and
[50:22] in every way he wants to lead us
[50:26] God's desire is never to dictate to us
[50:29] what needs to be done
[50:31] but he wants to lead us
[50:33] and that's that's what the holy spirit
[50:35] is he's a leader he's the spirit of
[50:37] Truth he's sent to lead and to guide us
[50:40] he's never the Holy Spirit brother Brown
[50:43] would describe he's a gentleman
[50:45] he's timid
[50:47] and brother Branham would speak of you
[50:49] know of how that we were to respond or
[50:52] to conduct ourselves he would talk about
[50:54] even in a service and so forth and so we
[50:57] recognize he's always a gentleman God
[50:59] never desires to force anybody into
[51:02] anything because if it's a force then
[51:05] it's not a love and it just it has to
[51:07] continue to be a force if you're if you
[51:10] serve him under a threat then it's
[51:12] always got to be a new threat and
[51:13] another threat and God doesn't operate
[51:16] that way but God's desire when he
[51:19] manifests himself and makes himself
[51:22] known to you and I now it can strike
[51:24] fear in our hearts but it's not a fear
[51:27] of a slavish sphere it's a fear his
[51:30] presence when he comes it what the fear
[51:34] that would come about our life is that
[51:36] him uncovering where you realize we are
[51:40] standing in the presence of almighty God
[51:43] and that there is nothing that is hidden
[51:47] from him it's as though that when as
[51:50] when he comes and it's not as though it
[51:52] is as it's though it's as though that
[51:55] whatever is upon your heart what is upon
[51:57] your life it's as though somebody has
[51:58] wrote it on the screen and that's
[52:00] because the word is a discerner of the
[52:04] thoughts and intents of the heart
[52:06] it's as real as you know I I've seen it
[52:09] over the years of you know uh is a
[52:12] ministering and you know and just
[52:14] sometimes the different reports you know
[52:16] no matter here or other places and every
[52:18] Minister could say the same no doubt
[52:20] that you know you have things that say
[52:21] well you seems like you were set in our
[52:23] conversation it seems like you were
[52:25] setting our table but we all realize
[52:27] it's not a man that was sitting at our
[52:30] table it was God
[52:32] and to recognize we have an All-Seeing
[52:36] Eye that's watching us and God himself
[52:39] knows every thought of our heart
[52:42] David even is assured Solomon when he
[52:46] was entering in to this place of
[52:49] leadership and kingship he in assured
[52:52] him not only should you serve him with a
[52:55] perfect heart but I want you to know God
[52:57] understands your imaginations he wants
[53:01] he wanted Solomon to know you're going
[53:02] to have questions but I want you to know
[53:04] God understands so don't allow the enemy
[53:09] to tell you Solomon that God doesn't
[53:11] understand God does understand
[53:14] one of the biggest things that Satan did
[53:17] when he came to Eve in the garden he
[53:20] couldn't tell he could not tell Eve that
[53:23] there wasn't a God but the way that he
[53:25] did it was just with flipping those
[53:27] words where he now begins to move yeh
[53:31] hath God said and he places it God an
[53:34] object of worship Elohim the
[53:37] self-existent one which is a powerful
[53:39] Revelation but God had revealed himself
[53:42] as Lord God one who is existing with his
[53:47] family but now Satan is wanting to take
[53:50] him back into a place to make it that
[53:53] this is this God that you're walking
[53:55] with that has given you promises he's so
[53:58] far off and so distant from you he can't
[54:02] even relate to you he can't even
[54:04] understand you and that was a big lie
[54:08] that Satan told because the only thing
[54:11] that she had to do I think back now as
[54:13] it comes you know so even as we Minister
[54:16] over the years but I really like our
[54:17] brother Trevor even said it here that
[54:19] night back in January that he should
[54:21] have just put the brakes on when Satan
[54:23] was saying all this and said you know
[54:25] what I'm gonna go ask my father about
[54:28] this
[54:29] it's just cut to the chase you wanted to
[54:31] say this and that let me just go talk to
[54:33] him because it's not your word that
[54:36] matters it's his word that matters
[54:38] because it's not I don't live off of
[54:41] your word that's death but I'm gonna go
[54:43] see what he says you'd like to go with
[54:46] me you're more than welcome but I'm
[54:47] gonna go see what he has to say because
[54:50] it's his word that he has given and he
[54:53] knows every Junction and every moment
[54:58] many times that's where we can get off
[55:00] within our own minds and our own
[55:02] thinking and we get off into you know so
[55:05] many different circumstantial things
[55:07] that we can get off into ourselves but
[55:09] when we are when we're looking at this
[55:12] and that of appropriate response I just
[55:15] upon my heart looking at this this how
[55:19] job in the midst of this in verse 20 and
[55:22] verse 22 uh you know everything that has
[55:26] come all around him has been touched you
[55:30] know the ten sons and you know all the
[55:33] daughters and all of them have this
[55:35] young children they've been touched they
[55:38] hear the sabians have come the Chaldeans
[55:41] have come a great wind has come a fire
[55:43] has come all of this consuming has come
[55:47] and there's no doubt there was a flood
[55:50] of emotions and responses that could
[55:55] have come forth in this moment
[55:58] remember the Bible says that the
[56:02] prophets of old were men subject to like
[56:05] passions such as we are
[56:09] there's nobody's DNA that's superhuman
[56:13] nobody
[56:15] the Holy Ghost does not when he comes
[56:18] does not change this to a glorified
[56:20] condition
[56:22] it's the Holy Spirit coming on the
[56:24] inside that now there is an anchor
[56:27] there's a new creation there's a new
[56:30] life it's the love of God that is
[56:32] pulsating in our life and it's by that
[56:35] strength and that strength alone that we
[56:37] live and we conduct Our Lives
[56:42] and when we see this job when this
[56:45] strikes
[56:46] he falls upon the ground he rents his
[56:49] mantle shaves his head and he begins to
[56:51] worship and the testimony is naked I
[56:55] came into my out of my mother's womb
[56:56] naked shall I return thither the lord
[57:00] gave and the Lord hath taken away
[57:01] blessed be the name of the Lord it shows
[57:04] that everything that is around us there
[57:08] are many things that are temporal it can
[57:10] be gone just like that
[57:12] all right
[57:13] just like that it can be gone because
[57:16] there's no promise of those things of
[57:19] riches or wealth or houses or lands or
[57:22] cars or anything else and for that
[57:24] matter as we've been looking at there's
[57:27] a purpose that we're called to serve
[57:30] within this life
[57:32] is that right
[57:34] I think when brother random talks about
[57:36] his family and the life story it just
[57:39] was striking as I'm just going through
[57:41] some of those things just you know
[57:43] listening here a little bit even this
[57:45] morning and brother Brown makes a
[57:47] statement like this it would preach but
[57:49] I'm not going to preach that now but if
[57:51] brother Branham talks about the family
[57:53] and the children he said those are the
[57:55] real things of life
[57:57] his family
[57:59] the relationship with it's not even
[58:01] things that are that are the real things
[58:03] things material things are not the real
[58:06] things of life it's family it's one
[58:09] another it's persons that's what's real
[58:13] right outside of the reality of God in
[58:16] our life These are things that is around
[58:19] us
[58:20] that's real
[58:23] so there's a lot of emotions and
[58:25] responses that can come let me just run
[58:28] through a few of them we'll see what we
[58:29] can get to tonight but there's a lot of
[58:31] emotions that can come from trials and
[58:35] tragic events and sometimes tragic
[58:37] events
[58:39] it's not just an accident it's not just
[58:41] an accident in a factory it's not just
[58:43] sometimes a tragic a tragic event can be
[58:46] all of a sudden there's a diagnosis of a
[58:48] disease
[58:50] and it just it all of a sudden something
[58:52] comes up and it just it's like it could
[58:54] take the wind right out of yourselves
[58:56] right there's a lot of emotions and a
[58:59] lot of feelings that can come our way
[59:01] anger
[59:03] fear
[59:04] worry
[59:06] doubt bitterness
[59:09] and Malice
[59:13] right
[59:14] now with all of those things you know as
[59:18] they go I don't want to try to just
[59:19] elaborate on all of that but sometimes
[59:22] we we those those things can come
[59:25] emotions that will try to come our way
[59:27] and I want to take you back into a place
[59:30] here that brother Branham I was reading
[59:32] this a few uh Sundays ago when brother
[59:34] Brown remember he was talking about the
[59:36] tragic accident that had happened where
[59:39] the lady her neck was broke instantly
[59:42] and brother band was talking about this
[59:45] and he remember he had a box of candy
[59:47] sitting right there on the table she
[59:48] just had made for him a few days ago
[59:52] and so brother bam is talking about and
[59:54] he's speaking of purpose speaking of
[59:56] that tragedy and and those things and he
[59:58] says he now he picks it up here a few
[1:00:01] Services uh later uh at the end of um in
[1:00:04] December of 63. it's all in that within
[1:00:07] just a couple weeks later and he says he
[1:00:09] says we have something a little sad a
[1:00:10] little something on the sad side this
[1:00:12] morning and he refers to the Coates
[1:00:14] family and how that they're all there
[1:00:16] and you know he says
[1:00:18] here was brother and sister coats and
[1:00:21] you know they were on the road home the
[1:00:22] other day from over in the west and
[1:00:24] someone slid on the road and killed
[1:00:26] sister coats instantly and program talks
[1:00:29] about seeing that box of candy that was
[1:00:32] there now let me just say this sister
[1:00:34] coats was 70 years old but it doesn't
[1:00:36] matter how old she was
[1:00:38] it was a sudden event that took place
[1:00:41] she had no other health issues going on
[1:00:44] brother Brown says you know he says I
[1:00:47] was just talking to her two girls just
[1:00:49] now in the room there and brother coats
[1:00:52] her husband is sitting here this morning
[1:00:54] he's got some broken ribs and I called
[1:00:56] him in the hospital where he was
[1:00:58] hospitalized over in Missouri and his
[1:01:01] ribs broken things but he certainly had
[1:01:04] a real courage a real Christian knowing
[1:01:08] that his little Queen is not dead she is
[1:01:11] Alive forevermore with Christ and there
[1:01:14] will be a uniting time now notice how
[1:01:16] brother Batman was saying he spoke to
[1:01:18] the husband when he's in the hospital
[1:01:19] with broken ribs he survived it but he
[1:01:21] says he had a real courage a real
[1:01:23] Christian knowing that his little Queen
[1:01:25] is not dead she's alive forever more
[1:01:27] with Christ and there'll be a reuniting
[1:01:30] time and brother Bram goes into quoting
[1:01:32] that of job and bringing down the
[1:01:34] purpose of of Nature and how we've
[1:01:36] looked at that the flowers serving the
[1:01:37] purpose there'll be a resurrection again
[1:01:39] and he says now brother coats he
[1:01:42] addressed him he says God bless you he's
[1:01:44] that I'm so happy to know that that seal
[1:01:49] of god holds in the hour of trouble
[1:01:54] he said I'm glad to know the Seal of god
[1:01:57] holds in the hour of trouble now let me
[1:01:59] just say this without elaborating on it
[1:02:01] when Jesus prayed for Peter he did not
[1:02:05] say Peter I'm praying that you don't
[1:02:07] fail he knows we are human we fail but I
[1:02:11] prayed for thy faith
[1:02:14] that thy faith fail not
[1:02:18] because Humanity will fail
[1:02:23] humanity is weakness Paul described this
[1:02:26] Humanity as an Earthen vessel like that
[1:02:29] of a piece of pottery that you don't set
[1:02:33] it down too hard it'll crack
[1:02:37] right
[1:02:38] but inside of that we have this
[1:02:41] Excellency
[1:02:42] and the Excellency is that the power of
[1:02:45] God that's dwelling on the inside of our
[1:02:47] life
[1:02:48] so the Highlight is not the outside
[1:02:51] the Highlight is who's on the inside
[1:02:55] so it's not me or you holding ourselves
[1:02:58] together it's Christ in us the hope of
[1:03:02] glory holding us together
[1:03:04] when God wrote to Joshua throughout and
[1:03:07] said don't be afraid don't be dismayed
[1:03:09] kept on repeating those words the word
[1:03:11] dismayed means to be shattered in many
[1:03:14] pieces
[1:03:15] so who is it that keeps you and I
[1:03:18] together that when the enemy wants to
[1:03:21] come with fear because he does
[1:03:24] things would like to strike fear because
[1:03:26] worry worry is a product of fear right
[1:03:30] and and what keeps you and I together is
[1:03:32] the Excellency of the power of God that
[1:03:35] is dwelling within our life that holds
[1:03:37] everything together the love of God so
[1:03:39] he said I'm so happy to know that the
[1:03:41] Seal of god holds in the hour of trouble
[1:03:44] and he says I I know what you're going
[1:03:46] through because I went through something
[1:03:47] similar years ago I want you I want to
[1:03:50] read this here to you
[1:03:52] this is one of the places I you know you
[1:03:55] think about many times and I don't want
[1:03:58] you to read into this in any way but uh
[1:04:00] brother Brown makes a statement
[1:04:02] referring here to sister coats and he
[1:04:03] says Lord he's praying he says we want
[1:04:06] to thank you for the memory of sister
[1:04:07] coats and what a precious dear sister
[1:04:10] and now the time comes that when we live
[1:04:12] our life our Span in life that's been
[1:04:15] lauded to us and we must cross the river
[1:04:17] we thank thee because that she did not
[1:04:20] have to suffer so I want you to notice
[1:04:22] how he's directing it we're finding
[1:04:25] things we can give things she didn't
[1:04:27] have to suffer and watch what he says
[1:04:29] concerning that there must not have been
[1:04:31] anything against her here that she had
[1:04:34] to suffer for
[1:04:36] she just went straight into the arms of
[1:04:39] God just in a moment
[1:04:42] and when I ask you not to read into that
[1:04:44] don't read into it and say oh I know
[1:04:46] brother so and so and says don't read
[1:04:48] into that
[1:04:49] because even some even within this when
[1:04:52] we see sometimes where there's things
[1:04:53] that can go very quickly we can't apply
[1:04:56] this right here and say hey there wasn't
[1:04:58] any suffering it went straight into the
[1:05:01] Arms of Jesus if I can say it in this
[1:05:03] way brother random made it clear Stephen
[1:05:06] never felt one rock
[1:05:09] he stepped right into that other body
[1:05:15] it was already present
[1:05:18] Hallelujah
[1:05:20] nothing is not somewhere a far off
[1:05:23] you realize brother Rambo says oh God
[1:05:25] let think he calls a glorified body in
[1:05:27] the early in in a message he says oh God
[1:05:30] let that glorified body move up next to
[1:05:32] him tonight and give him a charge Lord
[1:05:36] is a representation
[1:05:39] when this message when you've heard this
[1:05:41] message and left the other thing and
[1:05:44] it's become Eagle food to you you have
[1:05:46] heard from
[1:05:47] you would be awesome
[1:05:48] what is your theophany it's your
[1:05:51] representation Before the Throne of God
[1:05:54] that's why God the Holy Spirit ties you
[1:05:58] into that representation
[1:06:01] it ties you into there so now in this
[1:06:03] life you're living under the influence
[1:06:06] that Seed Life Is Coming forth you're
[1:06:09] living and manifesting in this Dimension
[1:06:12] another influence of another dimension
[1:06:15] yes a dimension of heavenly places that
[1:06:19] the believer has moved into
[1:06:21] Hallelujah
[1:06:24] so he says
[1:06:26] hear her hear Lord her husband her
[1:06:29] children are here this morning Lord
[1:06:30] right back to their poster Duty how we
[1:06:33] thank you for that Gallant Faith the
[1:06:35] faith of our fathers living still
[1:06:37] instead of dungeon flame and store sword
[1:06:40] we thank thee for all these things so
[1:06:42] brother random is pouring those things
[1:06:44] out and I just look at that like job
[1:06:46] when job when all of this took place
[1:06:49] job bowed his head and he worshiped
[1:06:53] he worshiped God
[1:06:55] I I just say God let this become near to
[1:06:58] us and gathered into fifth rib these are
[1:07:01] not things tonight that we're speaking
[1:07:03] of that just like oh I'm going to learn
[1:07:06] to be better this way that's not what
[1:07:08] this is I'm speaking of an expression of
[1:07:11] life
[1:07:12] what you what we see job expressing when
[1:07:16] he worships is because job was already
[1:07:19] walking by revelation of the sacrifice
[1:07:24] that God had made known to him and job
[1:07:28] said per Adventure my children have
[1:07:30] sinned maybe they feel like they have
[1:07:31] and they're entitled to certain things
[1:07:33] that's a sin so I'm going to cover that
[1:07:35] with a burnt offering and I'm going I
[1:07:38] know that God has made a way for this so
[1:07:41] I am going to offer that sacrifice
[1:07:47] that was job's that that's where job was
[1:07:50] standing so even though his heart was
[1:07:53] ripped out
[1:07:57] if you want to ask job job what matters
[1:08:01] more Joe could tell you that
[1:08:03] cattle
[1:08:05] I've got that back before
[1:08:07] right like remember brother Dao came to
[1:08:09] brother Branham at the end you know his
[1:08:11] life and brother down could say Hey
[1:08:13] brother brother down knew how to make
[1:08:14] money
[1:08:15] it was a businessman brother down from
[1:08:17] down to Brown Supply in in Lima Ohio
[1:08:19] brother Dao and sister down who passed
[1:08:21] on sister doll was a nurse down there
[1:08:23] now your brother Brandon he he knew
[1:08:25] brother down knew how and God blessed
[1:08:28] him but you see when when we look at
[1:08:30] this what was the most value was that of
[1:08:32] his children
[1:08:34] I can't get into this tonight
[1:08:37] but sometimes we give we can give job's
[1:08:39] wife a bad rap but those were her
[1:08:40] children too
[1:08:43] I can't touch that tonight but there's
[1:08:45] you see within this
[1:08:47] notice that all of this all of this
[1:08:50] that's around
[1:08:51] and notice let me get to the scripture
[1:08:53] here in Romans 8 35 who shall separate
[1:08:57] us from the love of Christ
[1:08:59] who shall shall tribulation distress
[1:09:03] persecution famine nakedness pearl sword
[1:09:07] all of those things
[1:09:09] none of them are welcoming to us
[1:09:13] anybody have a welcome mat for
[1:09:14] tribulation
[1:09:17] if you do you need prayer
[1:09:19] distress anybody like distress
[1:09:22] no
[1:09:24] you can take the you can take the DI off
[1:09:26] and I don't like stress
[1:09:29] persecution anybody like persecution new
[1:09:33] famine I can tell we don't like that
[1:09:35] nakedness Pearl or sword as it is
[1:09:38] written for thy sake we are killed all
[1:09:41] the day long for whose sake
[1:09:44] for his sake
[1:09:47] for his sake
[1:09:49] trials is not God coming against us
[1:09:54] Satan has got permission and it's not
[1:09:57] God doing it
[1:10:02] right
[1:10:03] we are counted as sheep for the
[1:10:06] slaughter now if you parallel that
[1:10:08] scripture think about with the Lamb of
[1:10:10] God
[1:10:11] he had to surrender his life in order
[1:10:15] that that life might be manifest In You
[1:10:19] and I
[1:10:21] and the same way in our life this is why
[1:10:24] the circumstance and things comes around
[1:10:27] us is so that that life might be made
[1:10:30] manifest through our lives
[1:10:35] because there's just no other way for
[1:10:37] our our character to be developed
[1:10:40] nay in all these things we are more than
[1:10:42] conquerors through him that loved us for
[1:10:45] I am persuaded that neither death nor
[1:10:47] life nor angels nor principalities nor
[1:10:50] powers nor things present nor things to
[1:10:52] come nor height nor depth nor any other
[1:10:54] creature shall be able to separate us
[1:10:56] from the love of God which is in Christ
[1:10:58] Jesus our lord notice a Common Thread in
[1:11:01] here the love of God
[1:11:06] that the love of God is the most
[1:11:09] prevailing power because the love of God
[1:11:12] is the Holy Ghost
[1:11:17] if you take away Divine love you have no
[1:11:20] brotherly love
[1:11:22] right
[1:11:24] and it's divine love it's love that this
[1:11:28] scripture that you and I can read and
[1:11:30] and draw strength from and say thank you
[1:11:34] Lord amen thank you Lord and and lay our
[1:11:37] lives on it we have this because one
[1:11:40] loved us
[1:11:42] and laid his life down for us
[1:11:45] and manifest his love to you and I
[1:11:50] what is it that caught you and I
[1:11:53] it wasn't oh they teach this they teach
[1:11:56] that it was the love of God that caught
[1:11:59] us
[1:12:00] that's what catches The Sinner
[1:12:03] not telling them this doctrine that
[1:12:05] Doctrine this Doctrine this Doctrine but
[1:12:07] the love of God
[1:12:11] God help us
[1:12:12] I don't want to go in that in that area
[1:12:14] but sometimes we need to we need to
[1:12:16] change and recognize that what this
[1:12:18] message has come to do is not produce
[1:12:21] doctrines
[1:12:23] it came to manifest Jesus Christ in
[1:12:27] flesh
[1:12:28] it's Jesus in your flesh
[1:12:33] Jesus that just cares
[1:12:39] hmm
[1:12:41] Hallelujah
[1:12:43] glory be to God
[1:12:46] charity the Bible says never failth
[1:12:49] a lot of things can fail
[1:12:53] a lot of things can fail but charity
[1:12:55] never fails
[1:12:57] the love of God never felt when we fail
[1:13:00] yet charity never fails
[1:13:03] right when we've had certain feelings
[1:13:06] but charity never fails because remember
[1:13:07] it's charity that is the creative power
[1:13:10] of God in our life
[1:13:14] but the man remember I'm talking about
[1:13:15] in his own walk with his own life
[1:13:18] and in the life story
[1:13:21] he was talking about remember he'd
[1:13:22] referred to brother Coates I'm glad that
[1:13:24] the Seal of god holds in that time and
[1:13:25] in that hour and he says you know
[1:13:28] remember the brand was asked the
[1:13:29] question brother Bram did you keep your
[1:13:30] religion during that time when brother
[1:13:31] Brown Lost
[1:13:33] his his wife
[1:13:35] lost his daughter
[1:13:39] and brother Brown says no he kept me
[1:13:43] and brother bran talks about that
[1:13:44] hardest hour that struck his life to
[1:13:46] where he had prayed
[1:13:48] for
[1:13:50] his daughter remember God took his wife
[1:13:53] even when he prayed for his wife
[1:13:56] here came the sheet down Black Sheep
[1:13:59] here came when he prayed for his
[1:14:01] daughter God that you would just Lord
[1:14:03] don't take her don't take her
[1:14:06] down came that black sheep
[1:14:09] now brother Branham talks personally for
[1:14:12] his own life he doesn't he's not saying
[1:14:14] this to give and to give that this
[1:14:17] applies to everybody as far as that this
[1:14:20] is what goes on but what brother Branham
[1:14:23] at that moment
[1:14:24] he realizes later on and realizes what
[1:14:27] has taken place when God had called him
[1:14:30] to go out
[1:14:31] and hold those revivals
[1:14:34] his mother-in-law Hope was going to go
[1:14:36] with him and his mother-in-law said
[1:14:38] you're not dragging my daughter around
[1:14:40] in that trash
[1:14:42] that's what she called the Pentecostal
[1:14:43] people
[1:14:47] and then you've seen the example here of
[1:14:49] brother Branham you know because the
[1:14:51] think of it pressure right
[1:14:53] it means the wrath of a mother-in-law
[1:14:55] you know
[1:14:59] but you understand
[1:15:00] you're the pressure that's an example
[1:15:02] for you and I brother Brown picks up
[1:15:04] that and he's telling you and I let it
[1:15:06] be stepping stones of God's grace
[1:15:08] because there's pressure we see that
[1:15:10] even in his ministry there's always
[1:15:12] pressure that comes pressure doesn't
[1:15:15] stop when all of a sudden we get 21
[1:15:17] years old pressure doesn't stop it keeps
[1:15:20] coming our way
[1:15:21] it don't matter how old you get you
[1:15:23] still feel pressure
[1:15:36] hope this is all right
[1:15:40] ma'am said Satan came up to me so here
[1:15:42] he said God wasn't going to speak to me
[1:15:45] he said so Satan came right but Stood
[1:15:46] Beside Me
[1:15:50] he said and Satan begin to
[1:15:53] tell me hmm
[1:15:55] what have you done you've went and
[1:15:57] prayed for people all night long
[1:16:01] you've sat in the chair and you've
[1:16:03] prayed and you've went and
[1:16:04] the labor and matter of fact your your
[1:16:07] wife you prayed about her he wouldn't
[1:16:09] answer you
[1:16:11] prayed about your you know your dad your
[1:16:14] daddy died your brother died just like
[1:16:17] that one right after another
[1:16:19] what's Satan doing he's building the
[1:16:21] case
[1:16:24] now Satan has come right up there to
[1:16:25] stand right next to him
[1:16:27] and brother Brown begins to talk about
[1:16:29] how that that gate of reasoning because
[1:16:31] we are three
[1:16:33] room house
[1:16:35] flesh spirit and soul
[1:16:40] that's why that the real the Holy Spirit
[1:16:44] the baptism of the Holy Spirit God
[1:16:47] then just our flesh
[1:16:50] it's got to be Deeper Than A Feeling
[1:16:52] which really turns in also to a spirit
[1:16:54] it's got to be deeper than just an
[1:16:57] emotion
[1:16:59] it's got to come down to that inner most
[1:17:03] realm because that's the Abiding Place
[1:17:08] that's where New Life takes place
[1:17:12] that's where New Creation takes place
[1:17:14] we're not against emotion I'm not
[1:17:16] against emotion you understand what I'm
[1:17:18] talking about it's very clear throughout
[1:17:21] the message of where our basis and our
[1:17:23] evidence has got to come back to where
[1:17:26] the sin question on the inside has been
[1:17:30] settled
[1:17:33] and then that's the anchor that we have
[1:17:36] in our life
[1:17:37] Satan stood right there next to the
[1:17:40] prophet and began to accuse God and
[1:17:44] brother Brahm said he couldn't tell me
[1:17:46] that there wasn't no God
[1:17:49] a new banner I had seen him
[1:17:51] I knew him
[1:17:54] but what he tried to tell him was he
[1:17:56] doesn't love you
[1:18:01] he don't care about you
[1:18:04] I hope you're understanding me Satan is
[1:18:07] an opportunist
[1:18:14] somebody can get in a car accident
[1:18:16] this guy's an opportunist let me strike
[1:18:19] fear
[1:18:21] somebody can have an accident at work
[1:18:23] let me strike fear
[1:18:25] right
[1:18:26] you're going to get to fear where it can
[1:18:28] absolutely paralyze ain't letting nobody
[1:18:30] Drive
[1:18:33] come on friends let's be real
[1:18:36] it can go on and on something can happen
[1:18:39] heart attack everybody starts feeling it
[1:18:41] oh my goodness oh my goodness What's
[1:18:43] Happening Here what's happening come on
[1:18:45] we've been there we've been there
[1:18:47] we've been there back in 2005. we've
[1:18:49] been there
[1:18:50] right what is it Satan is an opportunist
[1:18:53] I'm not saying we don't get things
[1:18:54] checked out but I'm trying to say Satan
[1:18:57] is an opportunist he wants to bring
[1:19:00] certain emotions
[1:19:06] because God doesn't bring anger
[1:19:09] God doesn't bring bitterness
[1:19:12] God doesn't bring malice
[1:19:14] God doesn't bring worry
[1:19:17] brother Adam tells us Satan and his imps
[1:19:20] bring those things
[1:19:22] but how do they bring them
[1:19:24] how does the cancer get started one
[1:19:27] little Bruce cell
[1:19:29] and then I just brother Brian explains
[1:19:31] that that life just slips right in there
[1:19:33] and it just starts building and building
[1:19:35] and building
[1:19:37] there's Satan's standing right next to
[1:19:39] the prophet
[1:19:41] and the different
[1:19:43] things that he's saying
[1:19:45] that brother Brown said
[1:19:47] even at that moment in the different
[1:19:48] places there in the message I know
[1:19:50] you're familiar with this
[1:19:51] when he's he says
[1:19:53] the reasoning the reasoning in the
[1:19:56] spirit Realm
[1:19:58] is agreeing with everything that Satan
[1:20:00] is saying
[1:20:02] are you hearing me these are the words
[1:20:03] of the prophet
[1:20:05] he said everything he was saying was the
[1:20:07] truth
[1:20:11] you couldn't deny it
[1:20:13] your daddy's gone your Mama's Gone your
[1:20:15] Baby's Gone
[1:20:16] your brother's gone you've prayed for
[1:20:19] people walk the streets and came in
[1:20:21] Wheels the morning put on your clothes
[1:20:22] slept in them for a couple hours and
[1:20:24] went back out to work the rep said
[1:20:26] everything everything he was saying he
[1:20:28] said now see everything here right there
[1:20:30] in that reasoning in that Spirit Realm
[1:20:34] and he said I was about ready to say
[1:20:37] I quit
[1:20:39] in another place brother Brown picks it
[1:20:41] up and he says I was getting ready to
[1:20:42] say well if that's the way he's going to
[1:20:44] be
[1:20:46] all right
[1:20:48] come on now
[1:20:51] you packed that same old boy around too
[1:20:55] if that's the way he's going to be what
[1:20:57] was Satan doing he's coming on those
[1:20:59] outer two Realms if that's the way he's
[1:21:02] going to be that's why your flesh you
[1:21:03] don't ever trust your flesh your flesh
[1:21:07] is not your buddy
[1:21:11] that's why Paul could say who will
[1:21:13] deliver me from The Wretched Man that I
[1:21:16] have I thank God through Jesus Christ
[1:21:21] Paul knew his deliverer it was Jesus
[1:21:24] Christ
[1:21:26] he can say with my flesh I serve I
[1:21:28] served that of the law of sin but inside
[1:21:31] there is another law
[1:21:33] and there's a war that goes on and
[1:21:35] brother Brown called it a constant War
[1:21:40] when a Believer has been quickened
[1:21:42] there's some new ownership on the inside
[1:21:44] we're not going by the influences of the
[1:21:46] world
[1:21:47] we've got different desires
[1:21:49] are you hearing me
[1:21:52] so here in the midst of that time he
[1:21:55] stands brother Brown says and brother
[1:21:57] Bram just says it just just clearly just
[1:21:59] like this he says
[1:22:01] but something he says
[1:22:03] something and when I was getting ready
[1:22:06] to say that if that's the way he's going
[1:22:08] to act then I won't serve him he said
[1:22:10] but there was something
[1:22:12] came from somewhere else way down on the
[1:22:16] inside and it said who are you to begin
[1:22:19] with
[1:22:21] the lord gave and the lord taketh away
[1:22:25] see that's the Inside Man
[1:22:30] that Inside Man
[1:22:32] is the product
[1:22:34] of the new creation
[1:22:37] of the Holy Ghost
[1:22:39] it's our anchor
[1:22:41] it's our absolute
[1:22:44] you're hearing me
[1:22:45] it's the absolute because what is on the
[1:22:49] inside of you is not different from the
[1:22:51] word but remember what is in you is the
[1:22:54] Holy Ghost and he is the word
[1:22:56] it is the word wrapped up in your life
[1:22:59] Jesus said my word is spirit and life
[1:23:02] it's an absolute working in our life
[1:23:05] right
[1:23:07] and what does an absolute do you judge
[1:23:09] All Things by that absolute
[1:23:11] when something comes a thought comes you
[1:23:14] bring it to the Judgment seat of the
[1:23:17] absolute to a real believer that's born
[1:23:19] of the spirit of God that
[1:23:21] it's not out there but the Judgment seat
[1:23:23] what you see what John saw in heaven is
[1:23:26] inside the believer
[1:23:29] the Judgment seat is there right there
[1:23:32] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:23:36] so here are
[1:23:38] for brother Branham
[1:23:41] actually in another in one place here
[1:23:43] let me pick it up here in another
[1:23:46] is it just just looking at a few things
[1:23:48] here
[1:23:49] and brother Brandon was looking remember
[1:23:52] he was crying out to God this is days
[1:23:54] later
[1:23:56] okay this is days later this is after
[1:23:58] the hospital thing I'm referring to this
[1:24:00] is days later
[1:24:02] that here he is in the midst of these
[1:24:04] days
[1:24:06] they just can't he's still thinking I
[1:24:09] can see my wife being taken
[1:24:11] but my baby
[1:24:13] I can't understand that
[1:24:16] now you and I we let's let's just let's
[1:24:18] just Fellowship on this because this is
[1:24:19] exactly where you and I get to on things
[1:24:22] we can come to a place and here we are
[1:24:24] it's just like it's
[1:24:25] it's settled
[1:24:28] and then we can get and we can start
[1:24:30] thinking about things
[1:24:32] and brother Brown starts thinking about
[1:24:34] it I said I couldn't understand that
[1:24:36] about my baby
[1:24:37] I can understand about my wife
[1:24:40] he's not charging God foolishly he just
[1:24:43] can't understand what's going on
[1:24:46] you know I understand my wife but my
[1:24:49] baby now remember within this he goes
[1:24:52] here's from a questioning and as he's
[1:24:54] thinking on that he becomes very
[1:24:57] despondent which who wouldn't be
[1:24:59] despondent or have the temptation to be
[1:25:02] despondent or depressed or down or in
[1:25:05] despair who wouldn't
[1:25:11] foreign
[1:25:12] it's not saying that Oh Brother Sam you
[1:25:15] know we ought to be full of joy joy is
[1:25:17] something on the inside
[1:25:19] because there's sometimes that this
[1:25:20] doesn't reflect what's on the inside
[1:25:22] even in the midst of Heartache there's
[1:25:25] joy on the inside the joy of the Lord is
[1:25:28] our strength
[1:25:30] what Joy is that that I know in whom I
[1:25:33] have believed
[1:25:35] and I'm persuaded he's able yeah that's
[1:25:38] the joy of the Lord
[1:25:41] that inside of this booth this temporary
[1:25:44] housing there's a real joy that God has
[1:25:47] brought here
[1:25:48] that I pass from Death unto life
[1:25:52] I don't know what's going on here I
[1:25:53] don't know what's going to come next but
[1:25:55] I know where I'm going
[1:25:57] I know where I'm come from and I know
[1:25:59] where I'm going between the here and
[1:26:00] there don't know all of that but I know
[1:26:02] where I'm going
[1:26:04] that's the joy of the Lord
[1:26:07] and that's where we draw from that's
[1:26:10] Wells springing up within us
[1:26:14] Rivers out of his belly Shuffle rivers
[1:26:16] of Living Water and here brother Branham
[1:26:18] comes into that place
[1:26:22] and brother Brown remember he's telling
[1:26:25] us here
[1:26:26] as we were looking at last week
[1:26:29] and he says it like this concerning let
[1:26:31] me as I go into this he says no matter
[1:26:33] how much we cry out we think this that
[1:26:36] or the other nothing can take us until
[1:26:38] God is finished with us and I'm so glad
[1:26:40] to know this he said sometimes you feel
[1:26:43] like as I did one time I put a pistol
[1:26:46] against my head to commit suicide but I
[1:26:48] couldn't do it
[1:26:52] are you hearing me
[1:26:53] I took my glove off no this is when he
[1:26:56] took my glove off he's thinking about
[1:26:58] Sharon he's thinking about hope he's up
[1:27:01] there working on the power lines
[1:27:04] he's had to crawl you know when brother
[1:27:05] Brown walked in power lines he did what
[1:27:08] now the helicopters do
[1:27:10] when he would walk that
[1:27:12] and look at him I went right through
[1:27:14] those areas and pointed out houses he
[1:27:15] would stay
[1:27:17] he's up there near one of these where
[1:27:19] all of these vaults are passing by
[1:27:22] and it strikes him brother I'm saying I
[1:27:24] don't even know what in the world got in
[1:27:25] my head
[1:27:26] he said and here I looked at that
[1:27:29] and I took my glove off
[1:27:31] I said Sharon
[1:27:33] I'll be with you Daddy I'll see you in
[1:27:35] just a few moments
[1:27:36] see just in that I could preach that
[1:27:39] that debunks that Roman Catholic
[1:27:42] falsehood that suicide sends you to hell
[1:27:46] come on somebody
[1:27:48] Saul didn't go to hell
[1:27:51] Samson didn't
[1:27:53] come on somebody see that's that that's
[1:27:56] not that's not biblical that's Roman
[1:27:58] Catholic tradition
[1:28:05] and brother Brandon when he's going to
[1:28:07] do it he's apologizing to God God I'm
[1:28:09] sorry I'm a coward I'm coming this way
[1:28:11] I'm sorry and brother Bram tells us he
[1:28:14] says if it had not been
[1:28:17] for that gift in my life he said I
[1:28:19] probably wouldn't have been here
[1:28:21] now let me just say this that gift in
[1:28:23] our life God's got a purpose for each of
[1:28:25] Our Lives
[1:28:29] and I hope you understand these very
[1:28:31] things where I'm going that there is
[1:28:33] something that we're trying to look at
[1:28:35] here and how God is just so pressed this
[1:28:36] is here you take a situation that has
[1:28:39] taken place and here of what is tried to
[1:28:42] come and move there even upon the
[1:28:45] prophet and he's brother Brown he's he's
[1:28:47] speaking of this here how he retched out
[1:28:49] to grab that line with his hands he says
[1:28:52] and here I was he says I was about gone
[1:28:55] myself he says like Elijah I was under a
[1:28:58] juniper tree it's hard
[1:29:07] I'm not trying to get us into a
[1:29:08] confession service but it's hard
[1:29:12] there's things that's hard
[1:29:15] right brother Brown's not trying to
[1:29:17] elevate that that's not what he's doing
[1:29:19] he's not saying let's Elevate but he's
[1:29:21] what is the ding thing that he's
[1:29:23] pointing to is that we come into
[1:29:25] situations like this emotions can come
[1:29:28] around within our life he said but he
[1:29:31] says I got to a place I was so beside
[1:29:33] myself I tried to make a gun shoot my
[1:29:36] brains out but it wouldn't do it there's
[1:29:38] work to be done something has to be done
[1:29:41] God wasn't finished he'll always take
[1:29:44] care of you that was a reality that the
[1:29:47] prophet came to
[1:29:49] think of God's grace hadn't come to him
[1:29:52] and he would have just been and remained
[1:29:54] in that stupor
[1:29:57] would he have had a right
[1:29:59] sure he would have had a right but there
[1:30:02] was a strength from an unseen realm that
[1:30:06] he tapped into as the Son and Daughter
[1:30:08] of God let me say it like this things
[1:30:10] can come our way but those things do not
[1:30:14] define who we are as Sons and Daughters
[1:30:16] of God depression can come your way
[1:30:19] anxiety can come your way but it doesn't
[1:30:22] Define who you are because that CG on
[1:30:26] the inside there is no weakness
[1:30:31] our natural family tree is flawed it's
[1:30:36] filled with weakness but there is no
[1:30:39] weakness in the DNA of almighty God
[1:30:44] are you hearing me
[1:30:46] brother Randall would pick it up and
[1:30:47] spoke a word's Original Seed and he
[1:30:49] would let us know he said if this
[1:30:52] natural family tree that I'm of has
[1:30:54] certain strains what about he said that
[1:30:57] tree of life but I've been born of that
[1:31:00] life it has strings of predestination
[1:31:04] [Music]
[1:31:05] damn it yes
[1:31:08] Hallelujah
[1:31:12] sometimes
[1:31:14] We can question ourselves
[1:31:16] I'm just speaking these just as the Lord
[1:31:18] has given these to me here over the
[1:31:20] weeks sometimes we can question
[1:31:22] ourselves
[1:31:26] we're not questioning God
[1:31:28] we question ourselves
[1:31:31] what's wrong with me
[1:31:33] I prayed nothing happens
[1:31:39] of course the devil's always there to
[1:31:40] give you encouragement you know
[1:31:44] the devil's never there to Build You Up
[1:31:46] incredible how the devil wants to build
[1:31:48] up people lives that really aren't right
[1:31:51] with God and then he wants to try to
[1:31:54] come and tear down lives and bring every
[1:31:55] accusation against hearts and lives that
[1:31:58] are right on with God
[1:32:00] are you with me
[1:32:04] you never found God rising up against
[1:32:06] the ten spies and say you guys are a
[1:32:08] bunch of unbelievers you guys are God
[1:32:09] never does that
[1:32:12] God never did that it manifested what
[1:32:15] they were
[1:32:16] when the circumstance came and presented
[1:32:19] itself adversity brought out what was in
[1:32:21] him the whole time
[1:32:25] is that right
[1:32:27] so we can question ourselves and
[1:32:28] circumstances let me give you an example
[1:32:30] because remember we were talking about
[1:32:31] this last week on the Untouchable that
[1:32:34] that there's nothing that can touch Our
[1:32:37] Lives
[1:32:38] unless God first permitted nothing's
[1:32:40] going to take us from here unless God
[1:32:42] first permits it
[1:32:43] and I was speaking of brother brother
[1:32:45] Bill and I were fellowshipping at the
[1:32:48] uh fire pit there and I was telling him
[1:32:50] after the service there on Sunday I was
[1:32:52] just kind of just thinking about one
[1:32:53] particular occurrence because when you
[1:32:55] we take that statement of nothing
[1:32:58] nothing's going to take us out of the
[1:32:59] Earth
[1:33:00] uh before that purpose has been served
[1:33:05] and yet you remember the situation
[1:33:06] brother Brown will talk about it at
[1:33:08] length in the Hebrew series uh and then
[1:33:11] he'll also talk about it after that
[1:33:12] there was a minister
[1:33:14] and brother Brown talked about that
[1:33:15] Minister had become so discouraged
[1:33:17] and when he became so discouraged he
[1:33:20] brother Ramsay brother Bram calls him
[1:33:22] out in a couple different messages
[1:33:24] and uh remember he he he he sent the
[1:33:27] worker because he had a garage and
[1:33:29] brother went to Brother Ramsey said
[1:33:30] brother Ramsey said hey he said I want
[1:33:32] you to come and go to memes with me he
[1:33:33] said no Billy said I don't serve God no
[1:33:34] more
[1:33:36] but the man said what would you say nice
[1:33:39] I don't serve God no more Billy so
[1:33:41] brother Brown walked brother Brown
[1:33:43] walked away and brother Ben went home
[1:33:44] and like anybody else you know and
[1:33:46] things come like that you think maybe
[1:33:48] not just hearing things
[1:33:50] you know maybe I didn't have a you know
[1:33:52] the fourth shot of espresso today I need
[1:33:54] that something's not clicking right
[1:33:57] so brother Brandon went back and he said
[1:33:58] brother Ramsay said I you said something
[1:34:01] a while ago he said you know earlier
[1:34:03] today he said you said you weren't
[1:34:05] serving God no more he said that's right
[1:34:06] Billy I'm not
[1:34:09] but the RAM said surely you don't mean
[1:34:11] that
[1:34:12] and brother Ramsay said I do
[1:34:15] brother Ramsey had went and he sent this
[1:34:18] boy that was working for him and the boy
[1:34:20] gave the testimony he had sent this boy
[1:34:22] over across the river to give him a case
[1:34:23] of beer and bring it back and when he
[1:34:26] went to gold and drink that here he was
[1:34:29] under a car
[1:34:31] the car smashed it
[1:34:33] and brother Brown takes that up and
[1:34:34] brother Brown said see
[1:34:36] he said if you want heed to God's
[1:34:38] correction
[1:34:39] he'll have to take you home early
[1:34:42] now don't read into that
[1:34:44] you understand me don't read into that
[1:34:47] but it just goes to show if we heed to
[1:34:49] the correction of the Lord how important
[1:34:51] brother Brahm is dealing with that with
[1:34:52] correction of tests and trials and when
[1:34:54] those things come it we also that's
[1:34:56] something we need to heed to as well
[1:34:58] because here's the point God won't lose
[1:35:01] one
[1:35:03] God won't lose one but I don't know
[1:35:05] about you but I don't want my testimony
[1:35:07] to be on the side that you know what God
[1:35:08] had to bring me home early because I
[1:35:10] want to listen to him
[1:35:14] well that's free
[1:35:17] here's a little here's a little lady
[1:35:18] because we talked about being you know
[1:35:20] questioning sometimes here's a little
[1:35:22] lady and she had a dream
[1:35:24] and in this dream she dreamed that the
[1:35:26] devil had come up to the side of her bed
[1:35:28] and she he looked over and heard began
[1:35:30] to make all kinds of faces at her and he
[1:35:33] said I got you now
[1:35:36] she said something just happened to me
[1:35:38] brother Brandon she said I jumped up out
[1:35:40] in the dream I jumped up out of the bed
[1:35:42] and I said get out of here devil in the
[1:35:43] name of Jesus and I started running him
[1:35:45] and he run out of the house she said I
[1:35:48] don't understand what that means
[1:35:51] Brian said then the holy spirit being
[1:35:53] present he gave the interpretation he
[1:35:55] said it was a little while after that
[1:35:57] dream
[1:35:57] her husband had a heart attack
[1:35:59] and when she's seen her husband fall
[1:36:02] he's an aged man heavy man his hands
[1:36:04] went back and his eyes said death come
[1:36:06] to take him but God wasn't through with
[1:36:09] him now watch what happened and that
[1:36:11] little woman's Faith raised up and said
[1:36:13] I won't stand for it I call for his life
[1:36:16] in the name of Jesus Christ brother
[1:36:18] Brown said what it was the sixth sense
[1:36:21] rose up at that crucial moment that time
[1:36:24] that give her faith
[1:36:27] it wasn't that oh she had this Sixth
[1:36:31] Sense and she overwrote no it was it was
[1:36:34] not God's will for him to go at that
[1:36:37] time and there was an anointing that
[1:36:39] struck there
[1:36:41] it wasn't her speaking
[1:36:44] that anointing struck in that moment and
[1:36:46] says get out of here I won't settle for
[1:36:49] this
[1:36:51] God's watching over it that's why God
[1:36:54] anoints
[1:36:55] his body his people he anoints your life
[1:37:00] because remember we're not going
[1:37:02] anywhere
[1:37:03] until he's finished
[1:37:08] let me close on this one
[1:37:11] I remember the stats Cliff baby
[1:37:15] their sister Stancliff she gives the
[1:37:17] book profit visit South Africa to the
[1:37:19] doctor
[1:37:19] the baby's dying
[1:37:21] the baby dies
[1:37:23] the doctor reads the book well in the
[1:37:25] meantime whenever
[1:37:26] and he he showed you this doctor
[1:37:29] believed he says we're going to leave
[1:37:31] this baby in the oxygen tent I'm not
[1:37:33] going to say nothing and we're going to
[1:37:35] wait for brother Brown to come here
[1:37:37] for him to pray
[1:37:39] because he believed it just like sister
[1:37:40] stats with brother Brown prays this baby
[1:37:43] is going to be well
[1:37:46] and it comes back to a simple principle
[1:37:50] the son can do nothing
[1:37:53] but what he seeth the father doing
[1:37:57] so when prayer is offered in the sick
[1:38:02] get well
[1:38:03] it's God's will being done
[1:38:06] we're always in God's will when we're
[1:38:08] praying for health
[1:38:10] are you hearing me
[1:38:12] and it's God that anoints and inspires
[1:38:15] you never know it can be your faith out
[1:38:17] there in praying and there might be some
[1:38:18] right here and your faith
[1:38:21] is what's touching the Throne of God for
[1:38:22] this need
[1:38:27] and here with sister stats Cliff which
[1:38:28] this question can come
[1:38:31] she she hear the baby you remember the
[1:38:33] the Lord spoke to brother Brahman said
[1:38:35] don't
[1:38:37] don't rebuke that
[1:38:40] because that's the hand of the Lord
[1:38:42] it's pretty hard to understand didn't it
[1:38:48] it's very hard to understand
[1:38:53] so he got her on the phone
[1:38:56] he said no he said God has called your
[1:38:57] baby sister stats Cliff now see he was
[1:38:59] going to fly to Germany
[1:39:01] and this is what she said
[1:39:04] was it brother Branham my weakness of
[1:39:06] Faith every time I read this and I think
[1:39:09] about this it just it just strikes me
[1:39:13] was it my weakness of Faith see it's a
[1:39:15] question
[1:39:18] was there something I did
[1:39:20] was that that I know was I not fervent
[1:39:23] enough with God
[1:39:24] was it something that I
[1:39:27] I'm talking about floods of emotions
[1:39:30] that can come
[1:39:37] said you have great faith
[1:39:40] because you prayed for your baby and you
[1:39:43] and your husband held on to it God
[1:39:45] raised the baby and he refused to do it
[1:39:48] because he knows what's best and still
[1:39:52] you love him that's real faith
[1:39:58] Hallelujah
[1:40:01] that's real faith
[1:40:03] can we read the rest of it anybody when
[1:40:06] mountains are moving and things can have
[1:40:08] faith but let it go backwards one time
[1:40:10] and see how it works that's when you
[1:40:13] prove whether you've got faith
[1:40:15] or not
[1:40:18] remember the situation I just closed
[1:40:20] there
[1:40:21] remember the situation of the brother
[1:40:24] Billy Paul would tell the testimony
[1:40:27] there was a young boy
[1:40:29] young man
[1:40:31] he he went on home to be with the Lord
[1:40:36] and they called brother Branham in the
[1:40:37] hotel room and brother Brown was praying
[1:40:39] but then said let me let me let me talk
[1:40:41] to father
[1:40:43] so brother Brian begins to pray
[1:40:46] but then calls him up calls the calls
[1:40:48] the brother back up and he says to him
[1:40:50] he says now he says if you if you want
[1:40:52] me to
[1:40:53] he said I can ask for him to come back
[1:40:57] he said but if it was me
[1:40:59] I would leave him right where he's at
[1:41:04] does that make it easy on this side no
[1:41:09] but what it says is
[1:41:13] there waiting
[1:41:17] and like David when David remember when
[1:41:20] the baby had passed away the baby had
[1:41:23] died David got up he got cleaned up he
[1:41:26] stopped his fast David why are you
[1:41:28] stopping everything right now and David
[1:41:30] said
[1:41:31] because he said I cannot bring him back
[1:41:34] here
[1:41:35] but I can go where he is
[1:41:39] and God's
[1:41:41] [Applause]
[1:41:43] Gods can go
[1:41:47] it's about him who made a way
[1:41:51] he's made a way for you and I it's why
[1:41:54] we love him this is where it comes down
[1:41:56] to no matter tribulation famine whatever
[1:41:58] more it's the love of Christ there's a
[1:42:01] lot of things that can come our way but
[1:42:03] the love of Christ it holds it
[1:42:05] strengthens there it's a typos it's an
[1:42:07] anchor it's an absolute it's our
[1:42:10] strength that we draw from in the midst
[1:42:13] of that time
[1:42:15] just like brother Branham when he stood
[1:42:17] there after him you know with the the
[1:42:19] voltage line and and here he is on the
[1:42:21] ground and he goes home that day and
[1:42:23] he's just you know
[1:42:25] later he goes in and he says you know
[1:42:27] you're hearing that song about the wagon
[1:42:29] wheel and things out west immediately
[1:42:31] hear God
[1:42:32] here
[1:42:33] and a dream brother Bram calls it at
[1:42:35] that moment it goes into
[1:42:37] and he sees this Wagon Wheel and sees
[1:42:41] this wagon you know the schooner and
[1:42:43] here he sees this
[1:42:45] beautiful young lady walk up
[1:42:49] how you do
[1:42:50] how you do ma'am
[1:42:52] you didn't recognize her
[1:42:56] she was a baby
[1:42:58] when she left
[1:43:01] but she said Daddy
[1:43:03] don't you recognize me
[1:43:08] Sharon honey
[1:43:09] he said yes
[1:43:11] yes
[1:43:12] mamas of home she's doing well
[1:43:16] Hallelujah
[1:43:24] little babies over here
[1:43:25] sorry she died she passed as a little
[1:43:29] one but she went right into the prince
[1:43:31] of God because in God's photo album he
[1:43:34] takes a picture when we're at our Prime
[1:43:40] you're talking about a youth meeting
[1:43:41] we're going to
[1:43:45] what a youth meeting
[1:43:47] and the good thing about it is is we're
[1:43:49] not just going to be changed back young
[1:43:50] because we would be Youth and have the
[1:43:52] same issues we have now
[1:43:54] but it's complete change
[1:43:58] is complete change
[1:44:01] of glory be to God
[1:44:03] many emotions can come
[1:44:07] bitterness anger worry all let's not be
[1:44:10] we're not going to be coy a lot of
[1:44:12] things can flood in
[1:44:15] a lot of things can come our way with
[1:44:17] certain things when things come about
[1:44:20] but remember
[1:44:22] we have an absolute we have an anchor
[1:44:25] we have one that we can go to and if you
[1:44:28] don't have that tonight you need to make
[1:44:30] reservations
[1:44:32] and you need to ask God lord I need that
[1:44:34] absolute in my life
[1:44:36] I need that anchor that in the midst
[1:44:38] when everything else is going on there's
[1:44:40] something that holds me Steady in the
[1:44:43] midst of it all
[1:44:44] because the church won't do it
[1:44:47] just knowing the message won't do it
[1:44:49] you've got to have a relationship with
[1:44:51] Jesus Christ
[1:44:53] and it's an anchor that holds you that
[1:44:55] no matter what comes or goes it's an
[1:44:58] anchor that holds you
[1:45:01] well I'm thankful tonight for we can
[1:45:03] draw from that anchor aren't you
[1:45:05] amen musicians if you come
[1:45:08] let's sing that song Hold to God's
[1:45:10] unchanging hand hold to God's unchanging
[1:45:13] hand remember tonight as we're looking
[1:45:15] at this appropriate response God is Not
[1:45:18] dictating to us he's not demanding or
[1:45:20] commanding but God is leading us and
[1:45:23] directing us that no matter test of
[1:45:25] trial no matter what comes that even in
[1:45:28] the midst of this in the midst
[1:45:30] of even a tragic and tragedy and in the
[1:45:33] midst of things
[1:45:36] that we can worship
[1:45:39] and to recognize that God is in control
[1:45:43] he's overall it's my worship listen to
[1:45:46] me now my worship's not based on what I
[1:45:48] understand
[1:45:50] because brother Branham tells us I read
[1:45:52] that quote to you a couple weeks ago in
[1:45:53] 1964 message Shalom he said sometimes
[1:45:56] people ask the question why he said I've
[1:45:58] asked the question why
[1:45:59] he said but what I had to do he said
[1:46:01] when my family
[1:46:02] my wife and my children he said I just
[1:46:04] had to put my hand in his hand and say
[1:46:06] Lord I trust you
[1:46:08] I trust you
[1:46:13] I think I was reading here today I've
[1:46:15] just I've been studying a lot just in
[1:46:17] within that and
[1:46:18] just with the over the past few days
[1:46:20] just with just with things
[1:46:22] concerning even around this and how the
[1:46:25] Lord has taken different angles on it
[1:46:26] and just to see how that the enemy will
[1:46:29] would so come there was one sister in a
[1:46:31] prayer line
[1:46:32] she had comments and here the Holy
[1:46:34] Spirit came right down and discerned
[1:46:37] what the nervousness was in her life
[1:46:40] the nervousness was a product
[1:46:42] because she had been told
[1:46:45] your son is missing in action
[1:46:49] and here's what the Holy Spirit tells
[1:46:51] her he says sister
[1:46:53] you go
[1:46:54] he said and don't you take no for an
[1:46:57] answer
[1:47:00] you understand what I'm saying
[1:47:02] Satan is an opportunist
[1:47:05] that sister didn't wasn't dealing with
[1:47:07] nervousness maybe before but it's an
[1:47:10] extreme right now because she's been
[1:47:12] told
[1:47:13] your boy's missing in action
[1:47:15] but here came the word of the Lord don't
[1:47:19] you take no for an answer
[1:47:21] let me say this to you
[1:47:25] I did I did a funeral here
[1:47:27] well some years ago maybe 10 years ago
[1:47:29] now
[1:47:31] I think 11 years ago
[1:47:33] and you had here I am a funeral and you
[1:47:35] know I'm ministering this funeral and
[1:47:37] you don't you have situations where
[1:47:39] individuals that it was brother Rodney
[1:47:42] and I'm standing here at that funeral
[1:47:44] and I realize here I am I'm in a room
[1:47:46] full of of people and that was it a
[1:47:48] Methodist Church or out there in Oberlin
[1:47:50] Church all around
[1:47:52] and I'm in the middle of it and I and
[1:47:54] the Lord just strikes and I took the
[1:47:57] subject Lord remember me
[1:48:00] and I realized all of them coming up
[1:48:02] here were talking about the Glory Days
[1:48:04] of basketball okay it's wonderful it's
[1:48:06] fine I mean there were you know maybe it
[1:48:08] was the only winning season Overland had
[1:48:10] I don't know Seasons but you understand
[1:48:12] there's there's camaraderie that I get
[1:48:14] that
[1:48:15] and all the all the different accolades
[1:48:17] and things but one thing I I this was
[1:48:19] pressed on my heart I said do you
[1:48:21] realize that the thief on the cross
[1:48:24] if you want to ask the people
[1:48:27] around him and said what do you think
[1:48:30] about this man all they knew is what led
[1:48:33] to that moment
[1:48:34] but what they didn't know was the last
[1:48:37] moments of his life was the most
[1:48:39] important moments
[1:48:43] you don't know what the last moments are
[1:48:46] come on somebody
[1:48:48] when he sat right there in that moment
[1:48:50] Lord remember me when you come into
[1:48:54] Paradise
[1:48:59] Hallelujah and I said it just like this
[1:49:03] I said there are many there's things
[1:49:05] that you know and I was even speaking
[1:49:06] there about brother Ron yes and you know
[1:49:08] but the but the brother Rodney I know I
[1:49:11] know when God touched his life I know
[1:49:13] when God started dealing with his life I
[1:49:15] know how God started moving in his life
[1:49:16] and you know he kind of when he kind of
[1:49:18] kind of was drifting back your living
[1:49:20] God just brought her right back in line
[1:49:23] God knows what he's doing
[1:49:27] and I can share it like this even when I
[1:49:29] went to see him the first time brother
[1:49:32] Rodney I never went up there to preach
[1:49:34] to him
[1:49:35] I said I'm standing here as a buddy
[1:49:38] I said I've come because you're my
[1:49:40] friend and I come to pray for my friend
[1:49:42] I go there to preach to him
[1:49:44] I didn't go there to tell him you need
[1:49:45] this you need to do this you need to do
[1:49:47] that
[1:49:48] he needed Jesus
[1:49:51] he needed to experience the love of God
[1:49:55] are you hearing me now
[1:49:57] oh God May that may that be within
[1:49:59] that's what this that's what the world
[1:50:01] is dying for the love of God's Not A
[1:50:03] compromising love is not a sugar sappy
[1:50:05] thing
[1:50:06] it's expression that I care about you
[1:50:09] because Jesus cares about you
[1:50:12] Hallelujah glory be to God

[1:55:02] your hosts
[1:55:03] [Music]
[1:55:16] I wish sister Bethany was here tonight
[1:55:18] I'd ever sing that song I never lost my
[1:55:21] praise
[1:55:22] amen what a fitting song I never lost my
[1:55:25] praise
[1:55:27] those circumstances come those
[1:55:29] situations that
[1:55:30] I never lost my praise
[1:55:33] you know part of the worship and when it
[1:55:35] says job out on the ground and job
[1:55:37] worship laid down his mantle he took he
[1:55:40] laid it all down and he worshiped
[1:55:44] what all the words that job said at that
[1:55:46] time I don't know
[1:55:48] but just simple worship would just say
[1:55:50] Lord
[1:55:52] you were in control Lord
[1:55:56] I don't know what's taking place but
[1:55:58] you're in control
[1:56:00] worship is not just confined to certain
[1:56:02] words of Hallelujah
[1:56:04] thank you Jesus worship is every day of
[1:56:08] our life
[1:56:09] it's an expression
[1:56:12] Lord I don't know what's taking place
[1:56:14] but I know you're in control
[1:56:16] I don't know all of this that's out here
[1:56:18] but
[1:56:18] I know that that burnt offering that you
[1:56:21] revealed to me is there's an acceptance
[1:56:24] there
[1:56:25] I don't know everything else around but
[1:56:27] I've Got Confidence
[1:56:28] in what you've revealed to me Lord
[1:56:30] because that's the only sure thing that
[1:56:32] I have right now there's a lot of
[1:56:34] speculation there's a lot of things
[1:56:36] coming Lord but there's one thing that I
[1:56:38] can worship I can worship in that
[1:56:41] assurity that Assurance of that
[1:56:44] revelation
[1:56:46] oh my
[1:56:48] how powerful Revelation really is
[1:56:52] it's a source to draw from in the midst
[1:56:56] that strength you realize that it's
[1:56:58] something that's strength that others
[1:57:00] can look at you they can look at how in
[1:57:02] the world are you making it how are you
[1:57:04] doing it
[1:57:06] it's because of him
[1:57:08] brother Brian sings that song it's
[1:57:09] something about you know I've it's not
[1:57:11] something that I've done or something I
[1:57:14] held on it isn't because of some I'm
[1:57:16] some great hero or you're some great
[1:57:18] hero or somebody else isn't it that
[1:57:20] [Music]
[1:57:21] the hero is the Lord Jesus
[1:57:24] he's my hero
[1:57:26] amen he's my big brother
[1:57:29] God came down and become kinfield
[1:57:33] is one we can lean on
[1:57:35] draw strength from
[1:57:38] you know what brother Jesus he
[1:57:39] understands us
[1:57:41] because the Bible says he was a man
[1:57:44] acquainted
[1:57:45] with sorrows
[1:57:50] he knows
[1:57:51] thank you
[1:57:52] as a matter of fact brother Brandon when
[1:57:54] I was studying that he says nobody
[1:57:57] could ever experience
[1:57:59] the grief
[1:58:00] that he experienced
[1:58:03] it shows he said that it was more than a
[1:58:06] mortal man
[1:58:07] to be able to endure that kind of grief
[1:58:12] think of it all the sin
[1:58:15] was laid upon him
[1:58:18] past present and future and not just the
[1:58:21] sin but all the mockery
[1:58:24] all the accusation all the criticism on
[1:58:27] and on and on but aren't you glad that
[1:58:29] he bore it
[1:58:31] aren't you glad he took it
[1:58:33] aren't you glad that he prayed
[1:58:35] nevertheless not my will thine will be
[1:58:37] done
[1:58:37] I'm glad he did it
[1:58:39] so that you and I we might be a partaker
[1:58:41] of that life right now that gives us
[1:58:43] strength
[1:58:45] there's something greater in US
