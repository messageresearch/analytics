[34:24] we're still kickin and but he was out
[34:28] our way here this last year and June so
[34:32] enjoy just I guess I've told it more
[34:36] than one place that that Samuel Browning
[34:39] is the best kept secret the message I
[34:43] really think you ought to preach every
[34:45] convention and just a fantastic
[34:49] fantastic brother and I've told this to
[34:53] many people probably never tell it to
[34:55] him so if he gets the archive bill he'll
[34:57] know but there's a few people in the
[35:01] world that I can just sit around and
[35:03] talk to for endless hours but brother
[35:07] Samuel from the day I met him just week
[35:11] and I just can't get away from him he
[35:13] just he's always got something
[35:15] interesting he's always he never loses
[35:17] my attention and we just kind of see
[35:19] things eye to eye and I just appreciate
[35:21] him and so glad there and I found out
[35:24] that he comes from good good souring his
[35:28] family it was just amazing I never
[35:31] really got to spend a lot of time with
[35:32] our dear brother Browning but with the
[35:36] sister Pat we've had a marvelous
[35:38] marvelous visit and just well I just
[35:41] know where he got it a man just can sit
[35:43] there fellowship with that sister all
[35:45] night and sister Kim came over well we
[35:48] just we brought in the new day I'll tell
[35:50] you it just seemed like every day it was
[35:51] a wonderful fellowship the food oh my
[35:55] word
[35:58] just I don't know I don't know if I'll
[35:59] be able to act the the same ever again I
[36:02] don't know just just really really felt
[36:06] like we were treated like kings and
[36:09] queen and my just a real real blessing
[36:14] so we just want to thank you and thank
[36:16] the family everybody for their
[36:18] hospitality and and just to come into
[36:22] the presence of the Lord you just don't
[36:24] I don't want it to just just a word of
[36:28] encouragement a word of admonition this
[36:31] morning don't let it become common just
[36:34] and entertain this sweet spirit always
[36:37] you just well I can tell you you just
[36:41] don't know what you got sometimes since
[36:43] so it's just really good to be in a
[36:46] lively church and we just appreciate
[36:48] that so much this morning and so I
[36:54] suppose if you have your Bibles this
[36:56] morning and would like to stand as we
[36:58] read the work I'd like for you to go
[37:00] with me into the book of Acts chapter 2
[37:04] and no doubt every Sunday school student
[37:09] could quote these scriptures by heart
[37:12] but we don't probably preach from them
[37:16] like we should but just a bit of a
[37:22] thought that came to my heart and so
[37:25] we'll just try to move with this as best
[37:28] that we can we're in Acts chapter 2 and
[37:31] there we want to begin reading at verse
[37:33] 37 Acts chapter 2 and verse 37 now when
[37:38] they had heard this they were pricked in
[37:39] their heart and said unto Peter and
[37:41] under the rest of the Apostles men and
[37:44] brethren what shall we do then Peter
[37:49] said unto them repent and be baptized
[37:52] every one of you in the name of Jesus
[37:54] Christ for the remission of sins and you
[38:00] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[38:04] for the promise
[38:08] can you say that with me the promise
[38:10] it's a promise is unto you and unto your
[38:16] children and to all that are afar off
[38:20] even as many as the Lord our God shall
[38:25] call let's pray together father we thank
[38:29] you Lord this morning O God for this
[38:32] this great word Lord that is before us
[38:35] no doubt that men have embraced these
[38:40] scriptures down through the annals of
[38:42] history Lord we realized that that it's
[38:49] a time-tested memorial and that when men
[38:55] and women would believe these things
[38:57] that they would receive the very benefit
[39:01] of the promise Lord and so Lord we just
[39:05] ask you today Lord as we humble
[39:08] ourselves before your mighty hand Lord
[39:11] and we come to bless your name and to
[39:15] honor this day this Day of Resurrection
[39:20] Lord the rest of the world is going in
[39:25] saying it's falling apart but father
[39:28] here this morning there is a little
[39:31] elect lady today Lord that has gathered
[39:34] to honor the resurrection - to bestow
[39:38] all of her praise upon the the one who
[39:42] is all deserving the Lord of glory the
[39:45] very mighty God so we praise you today
[39:49] we worship you we pray father that you
[39:52] will now take these scriptures and
[39:54] thoughts Lord and quotes that we have
[39:58] and Lord may you begin to weld them and
[40:03] blend them Lord and homogenizer God into
[40:06] our hearts the very meanings and Lord
[40:10] the very power and the very spirit of
[40:13] these words may they become real and
[40:15] living to our hearts as we give you all
[40:17] the things and praise
[40:19] Jesus lovely name god bless you friends
[40:23] you can have your seats this morning we
[40:24] what to I don't know why but it to pray
[40:32] it if my eyes start leaking and so and
[40:36] but we want to also while we're here
[40:40] just for some foundational scripture
[40:45] text I would like for you to look with
[40:46] me also in the book of Hebrews chapter
[40:49] six and while you're turning there I'll
[40:58] tell you a little story happened one
[41:00] time there was a fellow he was of some
[41:05] Spanish or Latin descent and so he had a
[41:08] bit of an exit and he had actually said
[41:13] some things that we were in quite
[41:15] agreement with but my my son was
[41:19] listening to him preach and we got home
[41:21] and we really are away home and my wife
[41:24] asked me says well what about this and
[41:25] what about this and my son Ian really
[41:27] never ever says anything about spiritual
[41:31] things or anything like that and he just
[41:34] piped up he said he said I knew that man
[41:37] was off I said what I said I didn't know
[41:45] he was paying attention you know and he
[41:49] said I said whoa please Sonny expound
[41:53] upon this upon this great discernment
[41:55] that you have and he said well he I knew
[41:58] when he couldn't say Hebrews he said he
[42:00] booze he said I knew he was off right
[42:03] then I said oh my goodness I said
[42:07] sometimes that's about as far as our
[42:08] discernment go
[42:10] and so but it's Hebrews and so we're
[42:15] here there in chapter 6 this morning and
[42:19] I also want to read out of the book of
[42:23] Philippians so we won't be done with our
[42:25] Bibles here for just a bit I want to
[42:27] read out of Hebrews chapter 6 and verse
[42:30] 1 and I just just what I'm doing here is
[42:33] showing that there's not a contradiction
[42:36] from Acts chapter 2 as we move on into
[42:40] Paul's writings here and as we begin
[42:43] reading in verse 6 he says therefore
[42:45] leaving the principles of the doctrines
[42:48] of Christ let us go on into perfection
[42:51] not laying again the foundation of
[42:54] repentance from dead works and of faith
[42:57] towards God of the doctrine of baptisms
[42:59] and laying on of hands and of the
[43:02] resurrection of the Dead and of the
[43:05] eternal judgment he said but this we
[43:08] will do if God permit it so it wasn't
[43:12] saying that we're doing away with them
[43:14] but we're just not going to go back
[43:16] because he's going to take the Hebrew
[43:17] Church on into some deeper doctrines but
[43:22] he said but we will do this if the Lord
[43:25] permits we'll go back and lay these
[43:27] things again because that's how people
[43:29] learn is that right about schoolteachers
[43:32] we know we learned by repetition is that
[43:35] right by by Rhian stilling those same
[43:37] rudimentary thoughts over and over and
[43:40] then adding to them and go back and go
[43:43] through those same elementary thoughts
[43:45] again and then add to them so you don't
[43:47] so Paul was not saying we're doing away
[43:49] with them but that we he didn't have the
[43:53] the he wasn't going to spend a lot of
[43:56] time on that presently because remember
[43:58] he was writing this out as a letter and
[44:00] so he says these are things that we do
[44:02] believe but and then he went on into the
[44:06] greater applications of the scriptures
[44:08] there so he began to deal with some
[44:10] election and so forth
[44:13] thereon later in the chapter now if you
[44:15] go over into the book of Philippians
[44:18] want to kind of amplify this a bit
[44:22] further and we're in Chapter three and
[44:26] there we want to begin reading at verse
[44:30] 12 Paul writing to the Philippians rich
[44:37] here he says not as though I had already
[44:40] attained either this is Philippians 3
[44:43] and 12 he says not as though I had
[44:47] already attained either
[44:49] we're already perfect but I follow after
[44:52] if that I may apprehend for that which
[44:56] also I an apprehended of Christ Jesus
[44:59] brethren I count not myself to have
[45:01] apprehended but this one thing I do
[45:04] forgetting those things which are behind
[45:06] and reaching forth unto those things
[45:09] which are before I press towards the
[45:13] mark pressed towards them the mark for
[45:18] the prize of the high calling of God in
[45:22] Christ Jesus amen so now we have we have
[45:26] this little foundation that we've built
[45:29] here that we have a promise of God and I
[45:34] want to title the message this morning
[45:37] back to basics and so here we find that
[45:43] the Apostle Peter here at the inaugural
[45:46] sermon of the church brother BAM tells
[45:48] us this was the birthplace of the New
[45:52] Testament church was on the day of
[45:54] Pentecost and so we find that when the
[45:56] power of God had fallen and been dude
[45:59] with him with power from on high
[46:01] they came forth in acts 2 and they were
[46:04] they were shouting and praising God and
[46:08] speaking in tongues and and glorifying
[46:10] God and and then there was such a
[46:13] manifestation of the Spirit in these
[46:16] people's lives and so we realized that
[46:19] brother Branham tells us that he is the
[46:21] same yesterday today and forever he's
[46:25] the same in every respect I've ever said
[46:28] seen of discrepancy
[46:29] and every respect outside of the
[46:32] corporate body amen the same yesterday
[46:35] today and forever if you teach or preach
[46:37] anything other than that that is a seat
[46:39] of discrepancy so we look back and see
[46:42] what the first church was and then we
[46:44] begin to realize that we're many times
[46:47] far cry from what that first church was
[46:50] but we but but as Paul said here I'm
[46:53] laying aside all the things of my past
[46:56] and I'm pressing for the mark of the
[46:59] high calling in Christ Jesus we want to
[47:02] go back we want to we want to teach the
[47:05] deeper things we want to go many times
[47:06] and and expound on the on the on the
[47:09] greater revelations of the hour and the
[47:11] time that we live in which is 100%
[47:14] needed I believe that we should do it on
[47:16] a regular basis that's why we have a
[47:18] fivefold ministry that's why we have
[47:19] teachers and pastors that can do these
[47:21] things but sometimes the Evangelist has
[47:24] to come by and take us back to those
[47:27] those the basics and take us back to the
[47:29] the things because we got new people we
[47:32] got young people we've got people that
[47:34] are just gave their heart to the Lord
[47:36] and now they they need to be brought
[47:38] back into the end of them into the
[47:40] stream with the rest of us that have
[47:41] been around so long and got all Moss
[47:43] backed and sit on our pews so long that
[47:46] you know we just you know we don't we
[47:48] wonder sometimes why our children won't
[47:51] come to the island walk to the altar
[47:52] well I believe that we should lead my
[47:55] experience and lead by example amen and
[47:57] so sometimes I think that the reason
[47:59] that young people don't get a real fire
[48:01] baptism is because old people are not
[48:03] willing to lead and show the way
[48:05] amen amen myself in and so we just you
[48:10] know you just sometimes you just gotta
[48:12] you just got a set an example and blaze
[48:15] the trail for him like we were saying
[48:17] the other day now
[48:20] here was this Paul was preaching these
[48:24] things and showing that were that were
[48:27] not to do away with those things we're
[48:28] not to just be we don't get beyond those
[48:31] things but you know we find that the
[48:34] Bible says that we should repent every
[48:38] one of you well we don't ever stop
[48:41] repentance you know and I found that
[48:44] repent many times is misinterpreted
[48:46] because the word repent is a roman drill
[48:50] command that means about-face that's
[48:52] literally what it means to go the other
[48:54] way but well it's it's just many times
[48:58] it's it's lost in that interpretation oh
[49:01] well I was doing this and now I'm gonna
[49:03] do something different well no not
[49:05] altogether that way because repentance
[49:07] is an ongoing experience that every
[49:11] believer will have until the very time
[49:13] that they die or they receive a body
[49:16] change in and I found that the
[49:18] repentance if we could really understand
[49:21] repentance it is the condition of your
[49:25] conscience in the presence of God and so
[49:29] whenever a person and will take their
[49:32] conscious and they come into that
[49:33] presence and they begin to realize I've
[49:36] been doing this and I've been doing that
[49:37] and I said this and I thought that and I
[49:39] acted like that and then that begins
[49:41] that sets that that conscience becomes
[49:44] convicted and that then you turn from
[49:47] those things where you change that
[49:49] attitude that is a that is a great form
[49:52] of repentance it's something that must
[49:55] be done on a daily hourly
[49:57] moment-by-moment basis they keep
[49:59] yourself clean in the presence of God
[50:01] now it's not like the denomination is
[50:03] taught that if you went one mile over
[50:05] the speed limit and you wrecked your car
[50:06] and died and right there that you go to
[50:08] hell immediately they don't that's so
[50:11] that's so beyond what Paul was trying to
[50:13] say here and so we find out that when a
[50:15] person has truly repented and has been
[50:18] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[50:21] Christ and and they've been filled with
[50:23] the Holy Ghost are born again they're
[50:24] there there are new creature in Christ
[50:26] Jesus they've passed from death unto
[50:28] and then they can no more die than God
[50:31] Himself can die they can't be lost any
[50:34] more than God can be lost you're saved
[50:37] you're sealed into the day of redemption
[50:39] is that it and so the the fear is gone
[50:42] but we still want to be right we still
[50:46] want to live right we want to live holy
[50:48] in that holy spirit allows us to do
[50:51] these things now from the message
[50:57] fellowship we're gonna take a bit of a
[51:03] turn here he says God chose a place a
[51:05] place I like this called Adam and Eve
[51:10] and shed the blood of an innocent one
[51:13] and covered them with the substance of
[51:15] this innocent one with the blood upon
[51:19] them and that was the basis that men
[51:24] could talk to God and hear his word and
[51:28] and get his word was under the shed
[51:33] blood and so when we realized that
[51:36] repentance and remission from sin for
[51:39] the Bible says that you'll be be
[51:42] baptized in the name of Lord Jesus
[51:43] Christ for the remission of your sins
[51:46] well we it's not that the water remitted
[51:50] your sins but it's that you're going to
[51:53] the water to identify yourself in his
[51:56] death burial and resurrection and the
[51:58] supreme sacrifice that the Lord Jesus
[52:01] Christ made that day on Calvary and you
[52:04] go down in representation Andry
[52:07] repentance you're sorry for your sins
[52:09] you're you're turning from a life of sin
[52:12] to make Christ your Lord and King and
[52:14] then you go down in baptism typing the
[52:17] death you're raising again in a type of
[52:20] his resurrection and then he himself
[52:23] identifies your faith and since back the
[52:26] Holy Ghost upon you the gift of the Holy
[52:29] Ghost it's a gift a free gift you did
[52:32] not deserve it you did not do anything
[52:33] to earn it but it's God's grace amen the
[52:37] unmerited love in favor of Almighty God
[52:41] and bestows upon you the very life amen
[52:44] that was in him and if that life
[52:46] Amen that brought him out of the grave
[52:48] if it Wells in you in a quicken your
[52:51] mortal body hallelujah in this life and
[52:56] in the world to come brother madam uses
[53:02] this place in the message fellowship
[53:07] that we read as the approach to God he
[53:13] said it's our approach that matters it
[53:17] means everything and so we find today
[53:20] when young people go for a interview
[53:25] they go in there and they got you know
[53:28] gauges that look like a toilet bowl in
[53:30] their head and you know big ol rings in
[53:33] their ears and you know they got studs
[53:36] in their nose and in their cheeks and
[53:38] you know they got dreads hanging down
[53:40] their neck and they want to go get a job
[53:42] and and a natural leader or boss or or
[53:48] superintendent or whatever just anyways
[53:51] for them called it slop dough what a
[53:55] language yeah just a slop goal just just
[53:58] you know sauntering in there and just a
[54:01] slob and think that you're going to get
[54:04] anywhere with that and so if you're
[54:07] taught from your earliest times of
[54:10] applying for position of any kind of a
[54:13] job and you know that you go dressed
[54:16] accordingly you find out what is
[54:19] acceptable with the type of you know if
[54:21] I was running a framing crew and I was
[54:23] building houses and I had a young man
[54:25] come up to me with a shirt and tie on
[54:27] and you know a real nice pair of you
[54:28] know Pierre Cardin slippers on or
[54:33] whatever you know I just don't think I'd
[54:36] really want that man on my framing job I
[54:38] just don't think that's the way to come
[54:41] that way
[54:41] maybe with a nice flannel shirt on and
[54:43] some blue jeans and a pair of work boots
[54:45] and you know a shake my hand
[54:47] give me a good grip and I said well that
[54:49] feller he knows how to work you see he
[54:51] would even get my attention you see but
[54:54] if it gives me a little limp and wrists
[54:55] like that hey coming on my job I'm
[54:57] telling you right now and so it's your
[55:00] approach you see and so if you were
[55:03] going to get an executive job then you
[55:04] may want to dress in a shirt and tie in
[55:06] and look look the part and because
[55:08] you're in a more of an executive type
[55:11] position but but Bevin talks about the
[55:15] approach to God he said oh you come in
[55:18] there and say old daddy Oh God you know
[55:21] I said you're not going to get anywhere
[55:23] with the Lord to approach to God and so
[55:27] that's why repentance was the very
[55:31] rudimentary the very foundational the
[55:35] very matrix of our Christian experience
[55:39] was repent they said men and brethren
[55:42] what shall we do he said repent every
[55:46] one of you well I find that that if we
[55:49] can truly find that place of true
[55:52] heartfelt godly sorrow and we could turn
[55:55] our heart to God and come to him
[55:58] repentant and and in truly truly
[56:02] submissive to the Holy Spirit you
[56:04] wouldn't have to agonize at an altar
[56:07] that you wouldn't have to go through 25
[56:10] camp meetings in two or three or four
[56:12] dozen preachers laying hands on you if
[56:15] you come the right way friends and truly
[56:18] submit yourself to God and bow before
[56:21] him and true heartfelt repentance Amen
[56:25] the Holy Ghost is already on the way
[56:29] [Applause]
[56:37] in the Bible we find in Exodus chapter 3
[56:41] that Moses had an approach and he came
[56:49] brother the Bible says in Exodus 3 verse
[56:52] 4 he says when the Lord saw that he
[56:56] turned aside to see God called to him
[56:59] out of the midst of the bush and said
[57:01] Moses Moses and he said here am I now
[57:07] when Moses said here am i he wasn't he
[57:12] wasn't at describing the geographical
[57:17] GPS location of where he was standing
[57:20] because God already knew where he was
[57:23] standing and so but what Moses was
[57:28] saying when he said here am I is that
[57:32] I'm not concerned about my Geographics
[57:36] I'm not I'm not concerned about my my um
[57:39] location God already knew where it was
[57:43] but what what he was identifying back to
[57:48] God was his condition and his position
[57:53] here in my Lord I'm I realized that I'm
[57:58] in the presence of something
[58:00] supernatural I mean I'm here Lord in a
[58:03] position to submit to whatever this
[58:07] voice is saying I'm in a condition to
[58:11] hear and to receive instructions Moses
[58:17] said and and Moses said unto God this is
[58:22] later in verse 11 he says Who am I and I
[58:26] thought this was striking as I looked at
[58:28] it because Moses said Who am I and when
[58:34] God spoke back to him he said I am he
[58:37] just reversed it said I am and
[58:41] Moses said Who am I but he says Who am I
[58:45] that I should go unto Pharaoh whom that
[58:47] I should bring forth the children Israel
[58:50] out of Egypt
[58:51] look at his this is his approach because
[58:54] now then the Lord's telling him I'm
[58:55] going to use you I'm gonna keep I'm
[58:57] gonna take you and I've seen that I've
[58:58] heard the cries of my people and I've
[58:59] seen the the persecution that they've
[59:02] received under their taskmasters and I
[59:04] know all these things and I've heard
[59:05] their cries and I'm going to send you
[59:07] down there he said but Who am I that I
[59:10] should bring forth the children of
[59:11] Israel out of Egypt verse 13 it says and
[59:15] Moses said unto God behold when I come
[59:17] unto the children of Israel and shall
[59:19] say unto them the god of your father's
[59:21] has sent me unto you and they shall say
[59:22] unto me what is his name and what shall
[59:24] I say unto them and God said unto Moses
[59:28] I am that I am and he said thou shalt
[59:33] say unto the children of Israel I am
[59:36] hath sent me unto you and so now that
[59:40] when Moses now we just kind of
[59:43] extrapolate here from from this point
[59:45] and we get down and now Moses brother
[59:48] BAM talks about him you know he was God
[59:49] it was veiled in Moses as a wonderful
[59:53] statement he said Moses became God and
[59:55] that God now dwelt in Moses and Moses
[59:58] was the veil that God lived in and he
[1:00:00] come down and got his wife he got his
[1:00:02] son and he got on a donkey and they went
[1:00:04] on their way down there he got his stick
[1:00:06] and they said Moses where are you going
[1:00:07] so I'm going down to Egypt to take over
[1:00:09] and he said a one-man invasion Airi
[1:00:13] force and so here it goes Moses he's on
[1:00:15] his way down there now when he gets
[1:00:18] there the very thing that he said to the
[1:00:20] Lord what was going to happen happened
[1:00:23] because he said he said the Lord your
[1:00:26] God has sent me to deliver you and they
[1:00:29] said well what is his name and he said I
[1:00:32] am that I am
[1:00:33] now then Moses now takes on the very
[1:00:37] first person of God he didn't say he is
[1:00:40] that he is or he was that he was or he
[1:00:43] will be that he will be know that Moses
[1:00:46] then becomes a very mouthpiece of God
[1:00:50] Lord told him he said you'll be God to
[1:00:53] Aaron and Aaron will be your prophet and
[1:00:55] so then here comes Moses I am that I am
[1:00:58] has said now we be proved that this
[1:01:01] warned that he was sent by was the one
[1:01:03] who sent him because now what does he do
[1:01:06] he begins to turn snake because he was
[1:01:09] given a sign did he sign in the hand a
[1:01:11] sign then he was by this stick that he
[1:01:13] had was turned into a serpent and
[1:01:16] leprosy and these curses that these
[1:01:18] plagues that would come by his very
[1:01:21] spoken word and so now then he became
[1:01:24] the very representation or as we could
[1:01:28] say the ambassador of Almighty God now
[1:01:32] then when an ambassador goes to another
[1:01:34] country and he goes there with what they
[1:01:38] call diplomatic immunity he is not he is
[1:01:42] in the country but he's not under the
[1:01:46] jurisdiction of that country he is under
[1:01:50] the jurisdiction of the country from
[1:01:52] whence he came hallelujah oh let me tell
[1:01:56] you Moses come down to Egypt as an
[1:01:59] ambassador of Almighty God he came down
[1:02:03] there with the very word of the king of
[1:02:05] the land from whence he came he came
[1:02:07] down there with the power and the
[1:02:09] authority to do whatever so ever that
[1:02:12] God had commanded him to do to set those
[1:02:15] people free he was ordained
[1:02:18] hallelujah of Almighty God to go down
[1:02:21] there and use whatever force necessary
[1:02:23] Oh glory to God Moses came down there is
[1:02:27] a weapon of mass destruction he came
[1:02:30] down there bearing Haman chemical
[1:02:32] biological and nuclear warfare he wasn't
[1:02:36] going to go down there and shoot him
[1:02:37] with a BB gun or a little bow gun or
[1:02:40] something like that no sir he went down
[1:02:42] there and drop anthrax on he did I
[1:02:46] looked it up in the thing that the
[1:02:48] burning on their head same word anthrax
[1:02:50] he wasn't joking around he's trying to
[1:02:53] drop in fire bombs napalm started coming
[1:02:56] out of heaven
[1:02:57] he started dropping it on their crops
[1:02:58] and on their fields out of a clear blue
[1:03:01] sky hail came down and burned like fire
[1:03:05] Moses was under the authority of the one
[1:03:10] who had sit here are you with me today
[1:03:13] church
[1:03:15] glory to God oh my you might help me a
[1:03:20] little bit getting warm up here dear
[1:03:26] moody tells a story about a young man he
[1:03:30] was a dual citizen of both the Great
[1:03:33] Britain and of the United States he had
[1:03:36] hired on to a merchant ship that worked
[1:03:42] in the the western Atlantic Caribbean
[1:03:46] theatres there they were good merchants
[1:03:49] work all down through there they back
[1:03:52] and forth across the Atlantic and one
[1:03:56] time there was the ship was accused and
[1:04:00] was identified as a pirate ship and the
[1:04:04] whole crew was taken captive by the
[1:04:07] Cuban Navy and they were brought and put
[1:04:12] in jail in Cuba and so he was been tried
[1:04:20] and convicted of piracy and even though
[1:04:25] he was a merchant he was an innocent man
[1:04:27] he did not was not a pirate but they
[1:04:29] tried him convicted him and sentenced
[1:04:33] him to death by firing squad and so
[1:04:37] during the time of his trial he was able
[1:04:41] to get a message out that could get to
[1:04:44] either the British or to the American
[1:04:47] consulate and to send help because and
[1:04:51] so the the American I believe it was
[1:04:54] consulate maybe both were able to come
[1:04:57] and hurt his case he was able to prove
[1:05:00] his innocence II to both American
[1:05:04] consulate and the British Consulate and
[1:05:06] they went to appeal his case to the
[1:05:08] Cuban government the
[1:05:10] Cuban government said that they're that
[1:05:12] they're a decision and that their their
[1:05:16] their sentence was final and that this
[1:05:20] man would be shot regardless of what
[1:05:22] they said they got a word back to the
[1:05:27] arm the United States and to Great
[1:05:31] Britain Great Britain and to tell the
[1:05:35] authorities that there was a man of both
[1:05:39] nation national citizenship that he was
[1:05:44] going they were going to shoot this man
[1:05:46] and that he was an innocent man and that
[1:05:49] he was a a citizen of the United States
[1:05:52] and of Great Britain and so the day came
[1:05:58] that he was to be executed and they they
[1:06:03] carried him led him down to the to the
[1:06:06] place of the wall where they were going
[1:06:07] to execute him by firing squad and so
[1:06:14] the man you know he had made his appeal
[1:06:16] he had done all that he could do and
[1:06:20] they they bound his hands behind his
[1:06:23] back and they led him to the place of
[1:06:25] execution
[1:06:26] they gave him his last words and they
[1:06:31] put a basically a hood over his head and
[1:06:38] stood him there and they began to the
[1:06:41] drum began to sound and the soldiers
[1:06:45] began marching into the the arena to
[1:06:49] perform the execution
[1:06:51] and as they get to this certain place
[1:06:54] they stop the procession they're
[1:06:58] standing there with their weapons in in
[1:06:59] in in in arms at port they're ready and
[1:07:03] they're giving the final prayer the far
[1:07:07] last rites the friar was there going
[1:07:10] through all the things and then they
[1:07:14] give the command to to take aim and as
[1:07:18] they begin to take aim or they say ready
[1:07:23] and they ready themselves and they drew
[1:07:26] it at about that time two men came
[1:07:29] running into the arena both of them
[1:07:32] streaming with their national flags and
[1:07:35] they ran to the man and the American
[1:07:38] grabbed the American flag took old glory
[1:07:42] hallelujah and wrapped the man in the
[1:07:45] American flag and the British man
[1:07:47] wrapped him amen in the British flag and
[1:07:51] they stood back and said fire all this
[1:07:53] if you dare
[1:07:55] Oh hallelujah amen and they put their
[1:07:59] weapons down because the Cubans did not
[1:08:02] warrant both nations amen the rulers of
[1:08:05] the sea and the rulers of the land they
[1:08:08] didn't want those two armies in their
[1:08:10] backyard
[1:08:11] Alleluia why because those ambassadors
[1:08:14] have the word of their nation fire
[1:08:18] Oh hallelujah
[1:08:23] well let me tell you came in one day
[1:08:25] Adams race Oh Adams race was was under
[1:08:30] execution orders remember Jesus came
[1:08:33] amen and he wrapped his blood and his
[1:08:36] rooms of righteousness around his little
[1:08:39] head oh why because he was a prisoner
[1:08:53] who had made his appeal when you repent
[1:08:57] of your sins you've made your appeal
[1:09:01] [Music]
[1:09:02] Amen now it was up to the nation from of
[1:09:07] his citizenship oh I'm not a citizen of
[1:09:12] this world any longer
[1:09:13] I've changed my residence I'm a citizen
[1:09:17] of glory and then I'm a citizen of the
[1:09:21] kingdom of God and now because I've
[1:09:26] changed my citizenship it's up to my
[1:09:29] nation to protect me it's up to my
[1:09:32] nation to rescue me it's up to my nation
[1:09:36] to save me oh you had to deliver me and
[1:09:40] to restore me back to my homeland oh
[1:09:46] praise be to God hate me what did he do
[1:09:49] but he ran out to him and greeted his
[1:09:52] son and wrapped his robes around him
[1:09:56] oh he said now prepare the banquet board
[1:10:04] but remember this man was blind in a
[1:10:08] hood over his head his hands were bound
[1:10:11] and he was helpless when we can get to
[1:10:14] that condition friend that's when God
[1:10:17] can do the most for you when because
[1:10:21] Paul said he said I sought the Lord I
[1:10:24] sought him for all these things and
[1:10:26] because of this thorn that was in my
[1:10:28] flesh and this messenger of Satan was
[1:10:30] sitting there to buff at me I saw the
[1:10:32] Lord thrice and the Lord spoke and said
[1:10:35] my grace is sufficient my face is
[1:10:39] sufficient in your weakness you're made
[1:10:44] strong Alleluia o my prophet of God says
[1:10:52] in this poor and sick and crippled up
[1:10:54] world is waiting for deliverance he said
[1:11:01] and they're looking at a signpost have
[1:11:04] mercy a signpost a signpost is nothing
[1:11:12] but a sign to prove the commission so
[1:11:19] when you're out here you see the sign
[1:11:21] over here that says there's so many
[1:11:23] miles from Lorraine or Sandusky er you
[1:11:26] know Cincinnati or Toledo or wherever
[1:11:28] you're headed you don't run out there
[1:11:31] and embrace the signpost I'm here I'm
[1:11:38] here I'm here you know it's at fifteen
[1:11:41] miles you still got a ways to go so
[1:11:45] that's what really I was saying here he
[1:11:48] says there he says there look there
[1:11:50] waiting for deliverance and looking at a
[1:11:53] signpost
[1:11:55] have mercy a signpost is nothing but a
[1:11:59] sign to prove the Commission
[1:12:04] so brother moon shows us that there was
[1:12:06] a sign he said and the sign was at one
[1:12:10] place he said the cross and the Bible
[1:12:13] were at another place he said in the
[1:12:14] middle was the words of the Commission
[1:12:16] oh my so now we begin to look at what is
[1:12:22] the Great Commission we can go
[1:12:25] throughout all the Gospels and we can
[1:12:28] find where the Bible tells us in Matthew
[1:12:30] 28:19 go into all the world and preach
[1:12:34] the gospel baptizing them in the name of
[1:12:37] the Father and of the Son and of the
[1:12:38] Holy Ghost and then we come over and we
[1:12:41] read our acts 2:38 which clarified what
[1:12:43] Jesus was saying based on one who had
[1:12:46] the keys of the kingdom and it comes and
[1:12:48] tells him to repent exactly what Jesus
[1:12:51] had told him to do he went and preached
[1:12:53] and exactly word for word we find over
[1:12:56] and that Jesus also tells him and in
[1:12:59] Luke's Gospel he tells him the same
[1:13:00] thing and we can spend a lot of time
[1:13:05] just going verse by verse over these
[1:13:07] things and so this this commission the
[1:13:09] Great Commission was given to the church
[1:13:13] and in mark 16 there which will read
[1:13:18] some of these as we get a little further
[1:13:19] down the road he said but the to prove
[1:13:22] the Commission brother man says there is
[1:13:25] a new ministry it's just been revealed
[1:13:29] to me pray for the sick get the people
[1:13:35] to believe you God can never leave that
[1:13:40] that's his commission no matter what
[1:13:43] goes on how much I fail I fail miserably
[1:13:46] I should never have went ahead with in
[1:13:50] signs that wasn't the will of God but
[1:13:53] God has blessed it anyhow but I'm ready
[1:13:56] to leave this mountain I want to go
[1:13:59] across Jordan I want to carry the
[1:14:02] Commission get the people to believe you
[1:14:05] so now that so we saw that brother
[1:14:08] Branham was given a commission what was
[1:14:11] the Commission now the the he says here
[1:14:15] was a commission I charge you
[1:14:17] were God and the elect angels and Jesus
[1:14:21] Christ the Commission was pray for the
[1:14:25] sick the question was insufficient to do
[1:14:31] it for this cause you were born this is
[1:14:35] the means of your peculiar look to
[1:14:38] peculiar birth and life that you are to
[1:14:41] pray for the sick if you'll get them to
[1:14:45] believe you and be sincere when you pray
[1:14:48] nothing shall stand before your prayer
[1:14:51] not even cancer
[1:14:55] alright so now we have so we're reading
[1:14:58] about brother brown's commission and and
[1:15:02] so then he says but they won't believe
[1:15:04] me he said I'll give you as Moses was
[1:15:06] given two signs I'll give you two signs
[1:15:09] and so then those signs became the thing
[1:15:12] that the people began to look at and
[1:15:14] that's why they could get healed and
[1:15:16] when the discernment came they believed
[1:15:18] they got healed the discernment came
[1:15:20] they believed that got healed he took
[1:15:21] him by the hand see the bumps on his
[1:15:23] hand go all these things he said it was
[1:15:25] this this and this they would believe
[1:15:26] he'd grabbed their hand again it would
[1:15:28] be gone they got healed he would
[1:15:30] prophesy and discern their thoughts and
[1:15:31] intents that their heart they got healed
[1:15:33] they believe they believe believe
[1:15:33] believe they would come to that they
[1:15:35] would come to the platform ascend up he
[1:15:37] was just going to want to pray for him
[1:15:38] they're just going to pray for you I'm
[1:15:39] just gonna pray for it they come through
[1:15:41] the line and as he would pray he would
[1:15:43] say now that I'm just gonna pray for
[1:15:44] said no no brother Branham but my case
[1:15:46] is special I have a special need I have
[1:15:50] a very special need I need you to I need
[1:15:52] you to use one of those gifts and that
[1:15:54] they were looking for those signposts
[1:15:57] and not looking at the word the
[1:16:00] Commission was to preach the gospel the
[1:16:05] good news read the word but they didn't
[1:16:08] want that they wanted a sign so then he
[1:16:10] would perform the sign and then they
[1:16:12] would get well they would go off the
[1:16:13] platform the next one comes and said but
[1:16:15] my case is just as important as his case
[1:16:17] and so he'd have to do it again and he
[1:16:19] said about six of those that he said
[1:16:21] they'd have to carry him out the
[1:16:22] platform he said how many thousands of
[1:16:25] people didn't get prayed for because
[1:16:27] they look to the sign
[1:16:30] he said oh he said he said he said how
[1:16:33] cruel was that for me to allow them to
[1:16:36] cause me to use the gift he said I even
[1:16:39] became to her relied on it myself he
[1:16:43] relied on that to pray for the people
[1:16:45] but the word was give the people to
[1:16:48] believe by how by preaching the gospel
[1:16:52] important that we understand something
[1:16:54] here because this was not just an
[1:16:58] individual Commission given to one man
[1:17:00] called William Brennan I've got a Bible
[1:17:04] full of places where the Bible tells me
[1:17:07] to go and preach to be in season and out
[1:17:10] of season to lay hands on the sick and
[1:17:12] they shall recover to get the people to
[1:17:14] believe if we can preach the gospel he
[1:17:18] that believeth and is baptized shall be
[1:17:20] saved he that believeth and is baptized
[1:17:24] shall be healed
[1:17:27] shall be delivered a men shall be it's
[1:17:30] the same word to the same people even
[1:17:33] just that we don't have this Messiah son
[1:17:36] operating in my life does not change the
[1:17:38] Word of God because when we begin to
[1:17:41] look at a signpost we'll never get to go
[1:17:44] where we're supposed to be he said we
[1:17:50] got a man can do a trick with his hand
[1:17:53] oh you ought to see it we got a man that
[1:17:56] can take a stick and make a snake out of
[1:17:59] it come and see that was just a signpost
[1:18:04] wasn't no different than in our day and
[1:18:09] God forbid then it becomes the same
[1:18:13] thing today oh well we just you know oh
[1:18:16] we just can't let the you know the
[1:18:18] pastor pray for us we're gonna have that
[1:18:20] evangelist oh he's just this that now or
[1:18:22] we got to go to some Kant lenient we've
[1:18:24] got to be under seven or eight days of
[1:18:26] meetings and it's got to become so
[1:18:27] electrified and everybody's falling out
[1:18:30] in the aisles before we can get healed
[1:18:34] I would I would that we could have
[1:18:38] little sister had he right walk in the
[1:18:40] building she didn't need all that she
[1:18:45] heard the testimony she said ain't
[1:18:47] nothing but the truth and God gave her
[1:18:49] the soles of her t cents hello oh my I
[1:18:56] think that we need to get back to basics
[1:18:59] hey hey hey man we've been circling this
[1:19:02] mountain a good while my brother man
[1:19:04] says I want to get away from this
[1:19:05] mountain I went across Jordan he said I
[1:19:08] want to carry the Commission get the
[1:19:10] people to believe you we got a man that
[1:19:14] could do a trick with a hand with the
[1:19:16] sticks and that was just a signpost that
[1:19:19] wasn't the Commission they wasn't
[1:19:22] waiting for a signpost god help us they
[1:19:25] were waiting for deliverance the
[1:19:28] children of Israel down there weren't
[1:19:29] waiting for a man to come down there and
[1:19:30] do a trick with a stick that's the way
[1:19:34] they interpreted it that's not what it
[1:19:36] was that was a sign to them to show them
[1:19:39] that hey yes the I am is here the I am
[1:19:43] is here but how much greater in the hour
[1:19:46] that we live in that if we can come and
[1:19:48] show you infallibly by the Word of God
[1:19:50] that you can be healed you can be
[1:19:53] delivered you can be saved and set free
[1:19:55] filled with the Holy Ghost based on the
[1:19:58] written word of God
[1:19:59] he said that was given to the church to
[1:20:02] prove that Satan could be defeated
[1:20:04] anytime anywhere and under any
[1:20:06] circumstances we have the greater when
[1:20:13] we don't wait I don't believe we've had
[1:20:15] our sign was a Malachi 4 prophet he came
[1:20:19] we saw the sign this message is the
[1:20:21] truth I don't need any more signs once I
[1:20:25] passed that first sign since so many
[1:20:27] miles you know the Lorraine or Sandusky
[1:20:31] or where we're going I don't need that
[1:20:32] sign no more huh I got onboard
[1:20:36] navigation tells me where I'm going oh
[1:20:41] my baby what is our boy
[1:20:44] navigation it's called GPS God's
[1:20:47] position sensor Oh My gods position
[1:20:53] satellite hallelujah it's telling us
[1:20:55] it's a guy that's the holy gold he said
[1:20:58] the Holy Ghost will lead God and direct
[1:21:01] you into all truth and I've got I've
[1:21:04] seen the signpost I know where I've been
[1:21:07] I don't know where I'm going Oh but let
[1:21:10] me hear the Commission going to all the
[1:21:13] world and preach preach preach with all
[1:21:16] that's in you hallelujah
[1:21:21] he said in these signs will follow them
[1:21:24] that believe you see get the people to
[1:21:28] believe and the science will follow
[1:21:35] you were to pray for sick people if
[1:21:38] you'll get them to believe you and be
[1:21:40] sincere when you pray nothing she'll
[1:21:43] stand before your prayer not even cancer
[1:21:49] it's time to get our eyes off of the
[1:21:52] signpost and get to looking at the
[1:21:54] Commission what was the Commission the
[1:21:57] Gospel he that believeth amen in his
[1:22:01] baptized shall be saved is the word Sozo
[1:22:07] means both salvation and healing it was
[1:22:12] all it was a complete Amen it was a it
[1:22:15] was a it was a like we're sharing with
[1:22:17] brother Paul there's a whole life
[1:22:18] package hey man it said but it's blessed
[1:22:22] assurance its whole life it even has
[1:22:25] roadside assistance any man hallelujah
[1:22:30] it won't just get you in the grave it'll
[1:22:32] get you out praise the Lord brother BAM
[1:22:41] speaking of had he right I just want to
[1:22:42] inject this she said brother Branham
[1:22:45] that's nothing but the truth
[1:22:47] she didn't just say it from here or from
[1:22:51] here but God spoke it out of her heart
[1:22:57] amen she didn't say it from here she
[1:22:59] said it from here they said but God
[1:23:01] spoke it from her heart
[1:23:02] oh my think about it friends now no I I
[1:23:07] brought you to a place and these are all
[1:23:10] loaded statements everything I've said
[1:23:13] up to this point is loaded very loaded
[1:23:16] because we want to see that God did him
[1:23:19] to sign he sent in today's of Moses
[1:23:21] Synod in our day that the Commission was
[1:23:24] given we have a great Commission we have
[1:23:27] that we have the Bible all of these
[1:23:29] things are pointing us to the very self
[1:23:31] same thing but then we come down to the
[1:23:34] Book of Revelations in chapter 10 and
[1:23:36] the Bible says in the days of the voice
[1:23:38] of the seventh angel and we find that it
[1:23:42] didn't say in the days of the seven
[1:23:43] angel or there be a lot of us they would
[1:23:46] be in a world of hurt
[1:23:47] you see but he said in the days of the
[1:23:49] voice and so there and then brother
[1:23:51] family what was the first thing that he
[1:23:53] speaks when it first recorded words that
[1:23:55] we have as they've just got some of
[1:23:57] these new recording gadgets that's what
[1:23:58] he said first words that we have and the
[1:24:00] message there about these recording
[1:24:02] gadgets now what were they for they were
[1:24:04] for a season and a time and the very
[1:24:07] fact that the voice could be recorded
[1:24:10] would be a sign to an electric of people
[1:24:13] because there would be an electro-pop
[1:24:15] people that would be looking for the
[1:24:18] voice they weren't looking for the man I
[1:24:21] don't need the man to come back I don't
[1:24:22] need discernment I don't even need the
[1:24:25] Lord Jesus himself to come and stand
[1:24:27] here oh you're a stretch no because
[1:24:30] brother Branham said if he was here he
[1:24:32] couldn't do anything more for you than
[1:24:34] he's already done brother Branham
[1:24:37] couldn't lead us any more to the message
[1:24:39] if he was standing here if he did have a
[1:24:42] return ministry he wouldn't have
[1:24:44] anything to say because in the days of
[1:24:47] the voice and then the voice of the
[1:24:51] seventh angel the mystery singular of
[1:24:55] God would be finished finito completo
[1:25:01] huh it'd be over finished doesn't need
[1:25:05] any more we've got all we have need of
[1:25:12] my thing is they said well we got to get
[1:25:14] beyond brother Brennan I was like I
[1:25:17] don't make sense because how can you get
[1:25:22] beyond if you've never got to I can't go
[1:25:31] beyond I never got to let me get what
[1:25:34] that prophet had let me walk in the
[1:25:37] shoes that he walked in hey man let me
[1:25:39] walk in the spirit in the fellowship and
[1:25:41] the approach to God that he had when I
[1:25:43] can walk like that then I'll get the
[1:25:45] results that that man gone
[1:25:47] [Applause]
[1:25:52] but what he said I'm ready to leave the
[1:25:55] mountain I want to go across Jordan I
[1:25:59] want to carry the Commission but you got
[1:26:02] to get the people to believe and so then
[1:26:05] we come and the Bible says in mark 16
[1:26:08] and verse 15 afterward he appeared unto
[1:26:11] the eleven as they said at me tinha
[1:26:14] watch this is this is monumental and and
[1:26:18] in the Bible says that he abraded them
[1:26:22] with their unbelief and their hardness
[1:26:25] of heart because they believe not on
[1:26:28] them which had seen him after he was
[1:26:30] risen and so now we have an hour day we
[1:26:35] had I witness 'as they saw the minute
[1:26:38] miracles the signs of wonders everything
[1:26:40] that happened in brother Browns life we
[1:26:41] have the tapes we have the audible
[1:26:45] personal testimonies of a man that that
[1:26:49] saw the unbelievable things done in our
[1:26:52] day there's no reason for me to doubt
[1:26:56] those things I don't have to doubt that
[1:26:58] brother Branham could call you out of
[1:27:01] the back row when he couldn't even see a
[1:27:03] little boy laying down in the back row
[1:27:05] on the floor and have the prophet of God
[1:27:08] reach out there and tell him and say
[1:27:11] mister mr. farmer you've been
[1:27:14] wondering if this ministry was true he
[1:27:17] said but I tell you you have a son he's
[1:27:20] there beside you the boy was laying on

[1:32:54] don't need I don't need a sign
[1:32:56] oh I you know I was I was wondering if
[1:33:02] I'd even tell this but I Philippe
[1:33:04] necessary I had just gotten saved and I
[1:33:08] started going I just started preaching
[1:33:10] just within just a couple of just a
[1:33:12] short time I was going to Arizona State
[1:33:14] pin and I was I was preaching there to a
[1:33:18] group of what they call the outside
[1:33:20] trustees these guys that could leave and
[1:33:21] come back but they had to come back
[1:33:22] every night and they were but they were
[1:33:24] read they were resident there in in the
[1:33:27] what they called the outside trustee
[1:33:29] unit at the Arizona State pin and I was
[1:33:33] I walked to the pulpit there was a group
[1:33:37] of men there probably twelve fourteen
[1:33:38] men there was a couple of brothers that
[1:33:40] came with us that were just there to
[1:33:42] support and play music and so forth
[1:33:44] walked into the
[1:33:46] the little fellowship there and I walked
[1:33:49] up and took my text and I was sitting
[1:33:51] there and all of a sudden it was though
[1:33:53] my eardrum had broken it was like I'm
[1:33:58] just like there's a hissing vibration
[1:34:01] noise in my ear and I was like oh my
[1:34:03] goodness and I just got up there to
[1:34:05] preach Oh huh oh my how can't preach
[1:34:07] like it I can't even talk hardly it was
[1:34:09] just a excruciating pain and I said
[1:34:12] brothers y'all have to pray for me
[1:34:13] something just happened to my ear
[1:34:15] feels like a broken speaker it's very
[1:34:17] painful and and I just I don't think I
[1:34:20] can go like this and there was a brother
[1:34:22] sitting there his name was David Fritz
[1:34:24] some of you may know him he went to
[1:34:27] Tucson Tabernacle for years and years
[1:34:28] he's retired now his precious brother
[1:34:30] brother David Fritz and brother David
[1:34:34] says brother Dale he says I've got the
[1:34:37] same thing in my ear he said I broke my
[1:34:38] eardrum on the job here just while back
[1:34:40] he said been suffering with it for a
[1:34:42] long time I said brother I never had
[1:34:44] nothing wrong with my ear in my life
[1:34:46] I said you pray for me and I'll pray for
[1:34:48] you and we believe God will heal us he
[1:34:51] said I believe that so we got her I laid
[1:34:53] my hand on his ear he laid his hand on
[1:34:54] mine we started praying a couple of
[1:34:57] seconds later both of our ears popped
[1:34:58] and we never had no trouble ever again
[1:35:01] huh
[1:35:06] I've never had nothing wrong with my ear
[1:35:08] before but it was a sign well I forgot
[1:35:12] about it I just loved it ago I never I
[1:35:14] never I never looked for those kind of
[1:35:16] things ever again in my life years later
[1:35:18] let's like 2007 there's 1983 or for
[1:35:23] somewhere along in there or late 83
[1:35:26] early 84 all the way 2007 I go to the
[1:35:31] Egypt I'm in the I'm in the in the Great
[1:35:33] Pyramid we go down all the way down the
[1:35:35] bottom got there my translators with me
[1:35:37] he's a brother from Lebanon named Pierre
[1:35:40] we went down the bottom we're on our way
[1:35:42] back out of there we're about halfway
[1:35:44] out and you got to bend over coming out
[1:35:46] of that tunnel coming up out of there
[1:35:47] and we're crawling her way out of there
[1:35:48] about halfway up he blows the LCL ACO
[1:35:52] LLC whichever one it is on the outside
[1:35:53] of his leg right here blows his knee out
[1:35:55] I mean he was like he's down on his knee
[1:35:58] crippled he's hurtin I mean he can't his
[1:36:01] big guy kinda like me and and so he
[1:36:03] can't and he was just crawling out of
[1:36:06] that out of the bottom of that tomb we
[1:36:09] got him up there and literally had to
[1:36:10] give him a shoulder so he could get him
[1:36:12] back to the car
[1:36:13] he stayed like that for oh that was on a
[1:36:17] Monday and all day Tuesday he just laid
[1:36:20] in bed iced his leg couldn't get around
[1:36:22] Wednesday we had church service that was
[1:36:25] the last service that I would be there
[1:36:26] and I had to fly out and he was our only
[1:36:28] translator and so he goes to the service
[1:36:31] and he's literally uh you know just
[1:36:33] crippling you know having it I think
[1:36:34] it's sound actually how to help him in
[1:36:35] the church
[1:36:36] he's in there and he's down in the
[1:36:38] basement of this church or this hotel
[1:36:41] and there's a basement conference room
[1:36:43] where we were at well I'd get there
[1:36:45] mother Tony admin gives me a ride over
[1:36:47] there we get out I'm getting out of the
[1:36:49] car I step out of the car
[1:36:50] and my knee blows out and I'm like oh
[1:36:56] what in the world
[1:36:57] and so I'm crippling my way down and but
[1:37:00] I had told Pierre about what happened
[1:37:03] back all them years ago I had forgot
[1:37:05] about it wasn't even in my mind I was
[1:37:07] tube Livius I thought oh here we go
[1:37:09] broke my leg you know I get in there and
[1:37:12] when I walk in the room I look up and
[1:37:15] peers jumping over to me and I'm jumping
[1:37:17] over
[1:37:17] to him and I said brother Pierre I
[1:37:20] believe God's fixing to do something I
[1:37:23] said your knee hurts right here he goes
[1:37:26] yes sir I said the same God that healed
[1:37:28] that boys ears go fix him to heal your
[1:37:30] leg
[1:37:30] we laid hands on each other both knees
[1:37:32] pop same time we jumped around the place
[1:37:35] shouting horrified why it was a sign it
[1:37:42] was a sign but I'm not looking at the
[1:37:45] sign the same God that gave the sign
[1:37:48] Amen is still here today whether I feel
[1:37:51] anything that I don't feel anything he's
[1:37:53] still the same Jesus well needless to
[1:37:58] say that thing has happened to me
[1:38:01] multiple times since then it waited such
[1:38:04] a long time probably because I didn't
[1:38:06] have the character to handle something
[1:38:07] like that I don't know that I do now but
[1:38:11] it still happens from time to time I'll
[1:38:14] get this unexplainable pain in my back
[1:38:18] upset stomach unexplainable just before
[1:38:22] and then all of a sudden somebody will
[1:38:23] come with that very issue and God heals
[1:38:25] them every time it's not failed once the
[1:38:28] one time it didn't happen immediately it
[1:38:30] was because the sister said God don't
[1:38:32] heal that way she said God don't heal
[1:38:36] that way and I felt better said I knew
[1:38:40] the Lord healed her but she walked away
[1:38:42] Oh still hurting and everything and in
[1:38:44] her mind she said God don't heal that
[1:38:46] way she went home put on the tape and
[1:38:49] brother Branham says on the tape God can
[1:38:52] heal you anywhere she jumped up said
[1:38:56] praise God she was oh my leading into
[1:39:08] this
[1:39:08] oh my these signs will follow them that
[1:39:13] believe in my name they'll cast out
[1:39:16] Devils they'll speak with new tongues
[1:39:19] they'll take up serpents if they drink
[1:39:21] any deadly thing it shall not hurt them
[1:39:23] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[1:39:25] they shall recover
[1:39:27] I didn't say anything about feeling a
[1:39:29] pain or having a gift or a discernment
[1:39:31] or sign in the hand or anything it just
[1:39:33] says they believe lay hands on the sick
[1:39:37] and they shall recover
[1:39:39] that's why brother Branham could say
[1:39:41] reach over and take your neighbor lay
[1:39:43] your hand on your neighbor there and
[1:39:44] pray a group prayer he said and then
[1:39:47] come back weeks later he said the
[1:39:48] testimonies would just come rolling in
[1:39:50] rolling in of all the people that got
[1:39:52] healed how many times brother man talk
[1:39:55] about the different ones about little
[1:39:57] rate Rebekah setting up there seeing
[1:39:59] that woman that need to be prayed for
[1:40:00] and said she needed it but she couldn't
[1:40:02] get up she couldn't raise her hand said
[1:40:04] daddy you couldn't see her no way and so
[1:40:06] he said she had such a burden on her
[1:40:07] heart said the very next night she
[1:40:09] brother Branham called round could even
[1:40:10] see her so where she was said she got
[1:40:12] she had a prayer car but she couldn't
[1:40:14] something hit maybe she didn't get a
[1:40:16] repair Kardon and she couldn't be seen
[1:40:18] but brother BAM still called her out
[1:40:20] because of Rebecca's prayer so now as I
[1:40:29] get ready to close these signs signpost
[1:40:36] brother Graham called him these kind of
[1:40:39] things they were to get the bear said
[1:40:41] what was it it was the healing was given
[1:40:44] as the bait on the hook
[1:40:48] he said they see the bait they take the
[1:40:51] bait and you get him with the hook so
[1:40:54] the healing and all these things all
[1:40:56] this the supernatural and so forth that
[1:40:59] there's many that saw those things that
[1:41:01] never ever serve God brother Bennett
[1:41:05] said that many times believers would
[1:41:07] come through the the the prayer line and
[1:41:09] not get healed he said but prostitutes
[1:41:13] could come and they would leave healed
[1:41:15] and never give their heart to the Lord
[1:41:17] he said that's when he had to change his
[1:41:19] ministry
[1:41:21] why because people would operate in
[1:41:23] faith and get healing but what was the
[1:41:27] greater healing was the salvation of
[1:41:29] your soul because Abraham said over and
[1:41:32] over he said a person can get healed
[1:41:35] today and die and go to hell tomorrow or
[1:41:39] that same disease can come back on him
[1:41:41] they'll die later of the same disease
[1:41:43] because they they they didn't do what
[1:41:46] the scripture showed them so it was more
[1:41:50] important to get right with God than any
[1:41:54] other thing now in the days of the voice
[1:42:05] brother Branham makes a statement he
[1:42:07] says now the words of Jesus it was
[1:42:12] referring back to the words when he
[1:42:13] spoke to the rich young ruler and said
[1:42:15] follow me he said those words are going
[1:42:18] around the earth and they've never
[1:42:21] stopped they said and those words come
[1:42:24] to each and every one of us so those
[1:42:27] words are still being uttered through
[1:42:29] the scripture through the preaching
[1:42:31] through the he said they're just in the
[1:42:33] out there and the Airways that we have a
[1:42:35] machine now that can pick it up and call
[1:42:36] it radio and TV so forth but in that in
[1:42:40] that dimensional room
[1:42:41] this word follow me is still out there
[1:42:44] it's still going around and around the
[1:42:47] earth every word that Jesus spoke is
[1:42:50] still out there going around the earth
[1:42:52] every sermon that every gospel preacher
[1:42:55] has ever preached is still out there
[1:42:57] going around the earth that day it's
[1:42:59] just still going and going and going
[1:43:01] brother Brown said that every a wicked
[1:43:05] thing that you ever thought Amen is out
[1:43:09] there on a magnetic tape he said the
[1:43:12] Bible says that you'll have to give an
[1:43:14] account for every idle word you've ever
[1:43:18] spoken it's still out there it's going
[1:43:21] around and around and around and he said
[1:43:23] on that great magnetic tape in that day
[1:43:25] he said it'll be played back to you
[1:43:27] I got quiet that's what he said the
[1:43:36] Bible said Jesus said it argue with him
[1:43:38] and so now then there's so so so because
[1:43:43] of that then when those prayers those
[1:43:45] that I'm just I'm pointing to something
[1:43:48] here this is like I said it's loaded
[1:43:49] because those prayers those blanket
[1:43:54] prayers that brother Branham prayed as a
[1:43:58] seventh messenger which is identified in
[1:44:01] the scripture that said in the days of
[1:44:04] the voice and so now then we don't have
[1:44:08] the means to play back the words of
[1:44:13] Jesus all we have is just the Bible
[1:44:14] record of it but there's many sermons
[1:44:18] that Jesus preached that we'll never
[1:44:20] hear just read over there in the pen I
[1:44:23] think it's John 4 where he goes over to
[1:44:26] Samaria and he discerns the thought of
[1:44:29] the of the of the of the Samaritan woman
[1:44:31] remember the story he tells her all that
[1:44:35] was in her heart and everything she
[1:44:36] never doubted about how many husbands
[1:44:37] that she had and she says sir I believe
[1:44:40] you're a prophet he says that's true he
[1:44:42] said women Messiah cometh he'll do these
[1:44:44] things that are me the Bible says she
[1:44:47] left her waterpot she went down into the
[1:44:48] city remember the story the part you
[1:44:51] probably don't remember because you just
[1:44:54] got the part of the broom tells but she
[1:44:57] went down into the city brother and said
[1:44:59] the whole town got converted secondarily
[1:45:01] from her testimony all right so she went
[1:45:06] down there the town comes out believes
[1:45:09] on the Lord Jesus because of her
[1:45:10] testimony but then the Bible says I bet
[1:45:13] you don't remember this that he they
[1:45:15] constrained him to stay with them
[1:45:18] he constrained that they constrained him
[1:45:21] to stay with him and he stayed two more
[1:45:23] days and went after two days of
[1:45:25] preaching to him then they said we
[1:45:28] believe not because of the woman's
[1:45:30] testimony but because of what he said
[1:45:33] [Applause]
[1:45:34] Oh hallelujah let me tell you those
[1:45:37] words are still going around the world
[1:45:40] What did he say I don't know but
[1:45:43] whatever it was it made them people
[1:45:45] believe hallelujah and so now my thought
[1:45:51] is we're getting back to basics here
[1:45:54] because we need it well sometimes we
[1:45:58] just get so caught up in the ethereal
[1:45:59] and you know we get it we get so afraid
[1:46:02] of of what the devil's throwing on us
[1:46:04] and you know conspiracy and global
[1:46:06] warming and you know and all these
[1:46:07] things
[1:46:08] well we've proven infallibly by the Word
[1:46:12] of God that there is global warming amen
[1:46:18] it's not a new doctrine it's been around
[1:46:21] for a long time Peter said that the
[1:46:24] earth shall burn with fervent Heat
[1:46:27] global warming the Bible says and when
[1:46:32] that fourth angel loses amen he's going
[1:46:35] to he's going to let his plague out on
[1:46:37] the Sun he's going to burn the people
[1:46:39] that's global warming sound like to me
[1:46:43] I'm just not going to be here to see it
[1:46:47] but we'll walk out on the ashes amen
[1:46:50] after it's all over so so in the days of
[1:46:55] the voice this voice is continuing it
[1:46:59] goes around the world it's playing every
[1:47:01] day somebody's house is playing one of
[1:47:04] these tapes but what I thought was
[1:47:11] God spoke to the Prophet and told him if
[1:47:18] you can get the people to believe
[1:47:20] nothing will stand in the way of your
[1:47:24] prayer and I thought well we go over
[1:47:28] into John 17 and we read Jesus's prayer
[1:47:32] and it's still in effect we read a
[1:47:35] sermon and the sermon is still in effect
[1:47:39] what about a prayer are those prayers
[1:47:44] still in effect I say they are I say
[1:47:50] they have to be because he said in the
[1:47:52] days of the voice and that voice is
[1:47:54] still playing he said rapturing faith
[1:47:57] lays and those messages what was it it
[1:48:01] was when he began to pray for the people
[1:48:03] and they got well in there but now we're
[1:48:06] playing the tape back just like we read
[1:48:08] the Bible back we read the Bible back we
[1:48:11] hear a sermon preached we get faith it
[1:48:13] raises our faith we receive our promise
[1:48:15] we get healed we get delivered we get
[1:48:18] set free we get saved we get it whatever
[1:48:20] we come for whatever your uh your how
[1:48:24] does he say that the right mental
[1:48:25] attitude towards any promise of God will
[1:48:27] bring it to pass in your life that's not
[1:48:30] poetic license friend that's the Sante
[1:48:32] Lord hallelujah so then the prophet
[1:48:36] comes and he says Heavenly Father oh
[1:48:39] it's a prayer he's praying he doesn't
[1:48:44] call anybody by name here it's just a
[1:48:47] blanket prayer and if you can believe it
[1:48:50] today this same prayer is in effect it's
[1:48:56] the Great Commission if you can believe
[1:48:58] that God sent a prophet and that Malachi
[1:49:00] 4 and revelations 10 was for you and you
[1:49:04] can believe than anything that that
[1:49:07] prophet said
[1:49:09] we'll come to pass in your life Patti
[1:49:12] right did it
[1:49:12] he wasn't quoting scripture he was just
[1:49:15] telling about a personal testimony she
[1:49:17] said that ain't nothin but the truth and
[1:49:18] God spoke out of her if you can believe
[1:49:24] like she believed God will speak out of
[1:49:26] you too Heavenly Father the hour is here
[1:49:32] he said the building's warm but it's
[1:49:36] time the time has come watch what he
[1:49:39] says
[1:49:40] I remember once our dear Lord when you
[1:49:43] looked up and said father the hour has
[1:49:45] come so if he could say the hours come
[1:49:49] and God would move on the time when the
[1:49:53] Lord Jesus spoke if you think Jesus
[1:49:55] didn't get his prayers answered
[1:49:56] hello it was God he said he always hears
[1:50:01] me yeah well brother Ram said when you
[1:50:05] pray through the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:50:06] God doesn't hear you he hears him so now
[1:50:09] who's praying you or him so God always
[1:50:13] answers his own prayers so when you pray
[1:50:16] God hears if you pray through the blood
[1:50:18] you have to hear you the hour is here
[1:50:23] the building's warm but the time has
[1:50:24] come I remember dear Lord when you

[1:50:33] Jordan the hour has come for the
[1:50:38] following the way of the church
[1:50:40] hours come the hour has come that
