Bibles this morning let's turn to Colossians chapter 1 we certainly want to welcome each and every one of you thankful to the Lord for His grace and providing for us another opportunity to be able to be together once again a man and to to hear from him and I believe that's what we're our purpose is here in coming they managed to be able to hear from him amen Colossians chapter 1 I want to begin reading in verse 12 I'm just gonna read a few verses and then we'll let you be seated here in verse 12 giving things unto the Father which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in life who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sin who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature for by him we're all things created that are in heaven that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist we could be talking about none other than God himself which is the Lord Jesus Christ amen and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence Amen let's just bow our heads in a word of Prayer Heavenly Father Lord what a privilege that we have to be able to come together Lord we are just Lord asking that Lord as we are assembled in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ the Lord if there be anything that would be contrary Lord to that precious name Lord we pray that God that right now Lord that it would be dismissed Lord God from the midst of your children Lord and may father you just moving among us in a real special way this morning Lord and just speak to every heart and each life Lord I believe that that's that's the purpose that's the desire Lord and your God to see how that you're able to move upon Lord God every life and every heart and speak to us Lord according to the level of understanding Lord that each of us would have Lord your God to know that your purpose Lord is that our lives would be change Lord and continually Lord to being transformed and changed Lord God into your image Lord I pray that God that you'll just Lord move Lord upon our lives and our hearts this morning for Lord we know that it's impossible for us to leave out of here the same way we come in the Lord we either leave closer to you or relief farther away but God we're purposed in our hearts Lord because Lord God it's your purpose Lord that we would be drawn closer to you Lord so help us Lord to receive of that word lay ourselves Lord upon the altar Lord and O God that you would move in a special way Lord and father Lord from our lives that there would come forth fruit Lord that you are calling for and desiring Lord and that your life Lord is present to enter John's Lord to release that for father we just give ourselves to you now Lord and what a Lord we're looking to you Lord for all things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen may God bless you as you're being seated this morning I want to continue reading there I also want to make mention to you which I think probably brother bill already shared with you is that we have the fellowship dinner here right after the service Morse's people and if you need to know the directions or the address you can see one of the brothers one of the Deacons we certainly would love to be able to have each and every one of you and get a time just to sit down and fellowship you know sometimes there are the days and times around us it is it gets very busy and it's sometimes it is uh a rare thing for us to be able to all sit down and be able to be together you know in a time like that and I think it's a wonderful thing that God would provide for us that were would be able to do that amen so whatever time that would you would have I believe it would be not only a blessing to us but also to you as well so let's look here in the scripture in I want to continue reading here in verse 19 for it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him I say whether they be things in earth or things in heaven so the death on the cross not only the blood and as he descended there into hell it not only took care of what was before him but it took care of all that was in the past and it took care of all of those who had been waiting under the revelation that God had given to them of the Lamb and they were walking by the lamb in that hour that word when it came to fulfillment in that time they were tied to that word although they hadn't lived in the fullness of it but they were tied to it in the part that had been made known to him so when the fullness itself had come on display then it was time for all of those parts to come together and assembly in Redemption and I believe we're living in that hour right now amen when all parts are being assembled unto himself I believe this with all my heart that the opening of this word that when the very the Spirit of God that when we read there in Revelations 10 when that mighty angel descended him and he opened and his mouth and he roared as a lion roar it's a it's a time of authority and to see that that friends I believe that it's something that went beyond just in these realms I believe it's more than just when we look at it and we we're able to thank God to have it there to listen to the message on tape and to read it but let me tell you that the real sounding of the word it is a supernatural sounding it goes forth and it begins together just like it did for those animals that in the time of Noah no one ever had to go and round him up but the word supernaturally begin to call him into position and in that same God even where the Prophet could make a declaration when he would say that the sounding of the trumpets and he was prepared to preach that message on the trumpets but he just couldn't find unease about it but the Spirit of God made it known to him they've already been preached supernaturally and to find that how that that word that was laying there benetiz was ordained for Israel and this time for Israel to be gathered back home that word begin to emit and sound within this time in this hour there's so many things that are taking place all at once but to see how that it's supernaturally that beyond that of just the natural hearing there is a voice that's going out and the Spirit of God is calling to his children and bringing us right into position right in life the only thing that we have to do is yield to that voice my mom who oughta be to God that's breaking over a little bit on midweek but it's such a wonderful thing to see this that it's him who is in control of all these other things you you realize dreams that this world is moved by voice this world is moved by by a spirit that's behind it and and you see that even in this hour it's a blessing it's a blessing reality that if you can look in your life and you feel that pull in your life of the Spirit of God and you can find the Spirit of God moving you and you're in this hour it's a blessed reality that you can recognize your day and your message and to recognize that the message that the Lord God had delivered to us in this hour amen it is a message truly that brings you and I into Liberty and with not only glory right now but to look to that glory that is to be hallelujah this is not this is not just the all of it but we know that there is to come a full deliverance of moving from this life into that life glory be to God my man notice in verse 21 he says and you I just may stop here with reading and move on into the message a little bit more and you that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works yet now hath he reconciled so at one time within our lives there by that mind that nature that was within us that nature that first birth was alienating us from who we really were it was alienating us from God but only he and he alone could come only he could reconcile bring into harmony that which was there all the time Paul goes on and you know Paul's letting it be known of the position that God has as has called him to and how that God's desire in verse 22 that in the body of his flesh the Lord Jesus through death to present you holy and unblameable and run reproval in his sight Paul continues about that full reckons reconciliation in that expectation of the gospel that translation and Paul would go on to speak of how that the the Ministry of reconciliation in another place was committed unto Him and Paul would speak that how that his is was was given to him by God and verse 25 this dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of God even the mystery which have been hid from ages and from generations but now is made manifest to his Saints that mystery of God's own life which is your true life is our true life this mystery of God the mystery of God itself is God's own life it is not a certain mystery it's the mystery of Christ himself moving into the believer that's the true mystery of God is the real true baptism of the Holy Ghost that's why that the Prophet could say in the adoption series there is not a theology on seminary that can handle nor hold nor disclose the mystery of God but the mystery of God is disclosed by Christ himself he has messengers he has servants but it's him that is disclosing the mystery of God and it's the mystery of God that sweeps upon the heart of the elect and draws us back into that position that God has given us before the foundation of the world this is the true riches you could be as poor as jobs Turkey this morning you could be poor but with Christ in you you're rich this is the true riches it's the REE greatest riches because you have received that which is greater than the even silver or gold that pass away but the blood of Jesus Christ that happened shared that opening of that blood cell has released alive that has come back to you and released you and there's true riches in your life you're living by riches you know you have to have substance to live by is that right so here this rich is this life this is true riches my how country that is with what the world presents even from you see from the very beginning of how the Satan approached Eve everything was trying to a cause and draw her in to operate by her own senses and what you can see and feel and taste let me say this as a believer all of these things around us sometimes they seem so real it seems such a reality but in the midst of it all like Jonah by the grace of God were able to look at those things by his word and say I don't care how much things that he would try to speak truth it's all lying Vanity's Jonah wasn't this wasn't mind over matter when Jonah lived in that realm he had to pick seaweed out of his face he had to you know wipe off his face from whale bile and he stood there because how could he stand there and say it's all line vanities because there was a promise by God's Word and Jonah knew he was standing there by a divine appointment and you are not standing here this morning by coincidence it is a divine of [Applause] things can arise all sorts of things but yet in the midst of it be thou not just me neither be thou afraid but be of a good courage hallelujah a true riches that we have received in this hour and to see that where it leads us to what an expectation we have as believers you understand sometimes expectations help you to get through things sometimes there's things that you can have maybe before I'm and you have a great taxing time ahead of you but maybe you have something planned as a family and and this is coming up or you know if I can hear at the end of the week mine and you know you go through all this and you know you're going to be doing this as a family or or this you know or you've got maybe for some of us just as simple as there's a certain dinner planned on a certain night of the week you know what I mean the certain two way you like the fish fixed or whatever morning huh I can't wait for this and you know some things is just so simple with my point is within it friends is that even within that realm expectations something to look forward to it keeps you moving through all everything else that's here how much greater for us as believers that through the midst of everything that is here there is a great expectation that has entered into our heart that we shall be changed I believe I'm one of them and I believe I'm looking at people this morning that are not going to experience death I believe that we're living in that hour the Word of God declares that in this hour that we're living in a menace a promise of a of an assurance that has come to us but Christ Himself making that known to us it gives us strength to face the things of the day because we have an expectation that this world is not my home I'm just passing through the Prophet and he lays it like this and I want to just just really move into this and my thought this morning I want to continue to pick that up on reunited with another nature and I want to deal with that but I want to work with with two words and those words are delivered and translated when we look at this I want to first of all just kind of laying back in a purpose there's a purpose for everything that God does there's a purpose God does not does not operate without a clear true purpose which is a motive an objective there's that which which which moves God so to think that here within this his coming to the earth the Prophet would say in 1958 and I just want to read a few places to you I trust you'll bear with me he says the scientific world stands speechless on it no one can come he said except my father draws him first Jesus didn't die to save the entire world he wanted to but he died to save those who God by foreknowledge knew would be saved not all men will come to him remember the scripture says in the book of Peter God is not willing that willing is not the same as his will that's willing his he doesn't want no one to perish and if his life is within us that's the same desire we have so this is where in the men in the message Lamb's Book of Life the Prophet says Jesus was slain or he says the Bible said that Jesus here was was slain before the foundation world was ever laid he said oh and he goes let me go on he says what he said Jesus was slain before the world even had the first speck of Bertling now you know that scripture revelation 13:8 the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world when you go to see see a play you're not going to see someone then all of a sudden is handed lines and you have to start at Libby I've been in them kind of situations I'm not a object beyond I'm not a good actor how was it I'm not a good actor at all you know but when you're in those kind of situations you know they put you in roleplay here real quick and somehow you got to be able to enter in you know try to capture whoever this is that you're stepping into their shoes you got to try to be you know somebody else to step into their shoes that is not what the drama and the plan of God is it was already laid out in the mind of God and everyone has their part within this play there is no trying out for roles there is no well you know it's open casting who wants the lead role that lead role has already been established a man in each junction of time when the curtain would close and one would begin to declare this is what you're about to see God already had them set apart that they would declare when the curtain opens this is what you see which is now prophecy what will now be made manifest before you a man they themselves are the seven stars in the right hand of God amen so here the whole plan has been laid out it's it's simply God in an hour he is declaring to the children of God that have lived down through time this is your role this is your part and the actual abilities that are needed to fulfill that role the individuals lack entirely and God himself has seen it fit that way then it would not be according to our own abilities but God calls those who have no abilities upon their own and I'm talking about an ability to fulfill his word but God does that that he might receive the glory through our life I'm grateful for that because you look even in that you take meals such as Apostle Paul who had great astounding abilities but God will use Paul and and let Paul be set forth for our example too even when we would have abilities it's to submit all those things to God and say Lord without you I am nothing [Applause] the Lord Jesus had all knowledge friends all he had knowledge he had knowledge of the written word but you know it took the Spirit of God to quicken that word to him and to make it a lot even to be able to express what needed to be expressed at the right time and what needed to be expressed through manifestation at the right time all of those things who are set forth by God himself so the only thing that that we have to do is say what do you understand what are your main movements in this and it's like somebody directly apply said no no no no you're not entering in right now you're not getting into it you know it's got to be more huh I'm glad that God sometimes says he need more feeling in your life you need more expression in your life it's like somebody strung over the door I'm so happy to see you it's so good to see you here today it's wonderful nothing no you need some more feeling in your life but you know what he's not asking us to create that feeling but by his presence he descends and brings out of us the feeling that's needed to fulfill that part gets him himself bringing out what's necessary and then he turns around and says you're an overcomer and it's him that brought out of us what needed to be come out of us it's all to his glory amen so here Jesus was slain before the foundation before the world even had the first speck of dirt laid Jesus was already slain amen he says you know that he said God before knowledge when he was the word in the beginning he perceived the thought and now it's just a thought then he spoke and it shall be and Jesus was slain the very minute God spoke the word the very minute is spoke the word he was already slain the Word of God is sure when God's Word has been spoken it's made sure it's him oh my oh my that applies us so much let me move on here he says for four thousand years later he come and paid the price that God had already done back here by his word he had to come all Devils in hell couldn't keep him from coming God had already spoken that word was laying there that word had to be fulfilled there wasn't enough Devils that could stop backward from be fulfilled because when God spoke the word it was already finished it had materialized but it was already finished and if all the Devils out of hell could not stop the groom from coming all the devil's of Hell cannot stop his bride [Applause] life of his life we are filming right form they meant that's the power of this word God is not then all of a sudden disclosing word that he has not already declared but it's this hour just like in the book of Genesis where the Prophet said many think God is repeating himself God is not repeating himself God is merely declaring what I have said it is now the hour for it to come forward and that's exactly with the word has has been spoken in this generation it is called declaring it is this time for the world to come forth and he sends his word in this hour what word that word of himself but he's already declared and you and I are a part of that word listen the devil tried the devil thought he had to remember he thought he had him enable remember how the Prophet would dramatize that he came again stable then he came against Jeremiah on and on what was it it was showing that one that would be tied in with God into that original sender that sacrifice with God that life would permeate listen friends it would be the same life that would be pulsating through you and I as the believer and Satan has always been after that life but you cannot distinguish God they might take a natural life as far as in this realm where we're living but you have not destroyed you have not taken that son and daughter away the only thing that's happened is they have went into a place after serving the purpose and they are dwelling there in the presence of God just like the Saints of old were dwelling in Paradise they were awaiting for the time glory be to God think of it he said before the foundation of the world God wrote your name in the Lamb's Book of Life by his spoken word and set Christ the sacrifice to buy to redeem the same group that he had wrote their names in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world so you see that the purpose in the coming was to redeem a sacrifice that was needed in order to buy back in order to pay the price in order to remove that separation that was between God and men that which was hindering fellowship and bring us back into that place that God intended for us to be glory be to God and now in the message when their eyes were opened he says and now if you were in the quickening at his beginning talking about in Christ that's what he come to redeem and your name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life in his thinking at the beginning and he come to redeem all names that's in that book no more not one more just what was in there and when the last name is redeemed he takes his book and claims what he has redeemed he's only they're still seating a synod upon the mediatorial work because he's waiting for that last name to be splashed in the bleach they meant for that last one to come into manifestation I'll tell you how close where the Prophet was was resting within that lookout that he was so in his own heart so alarmed there in souls in prison now he's making us aware of the hour of the time that we are living in in this hour this is a time of going home I tell you let me just say it right now with expectation don't even have an expectation of coming back to church on Thursday or on Sunday and what I mean by that is is don't live your life and bypass god's visitation we're thinking I've got another chance I've got another opportunity but this is the day of salvation this is a moment but all things ought to be settled this was a to let God have his way in your life how many times the Prophet would say it in total deliverance he said look he said you're still smoking them cigarettes he said but he said if you think by any means that well I'll come back on Wednesday night I'll come back on Sunday night he said it'll linger on with you but when you get to that point of life and death where I've got to have this Lord more than anything else I need deliverance he said when you get serious with God then God will come down and meet you right there on those conditions through expectations he's coming this is his purpose of the entirety of redemption is the Lord God laying aside his splendor I trust those are not just words to us but he laid aside his splendor when the Lord Jesus walked here upon this earth there were many miracles and signs and wonders that is true but remember his coming was miss the Prophet tells us 99% missed it in mountains mist is coming why it went over their head yet they have the word in front of them they've been reading the word they've been singing the word they've been all of these things but you see it shows that it's all of those things are wonderful I think it's wonderful to read the word and give ourselves to the word but I just say it like this friends there are things that when we read or you look across you don't understand don't try to classify it just say Lord I commit it into your hands if it is something that I need and it is something that's important then you will supply all my needs and you'll give me the understanding that I need in the right time in the right season is that right we're not lacking for anything God knows just exactly what we have neither he knows just your address he knows what you have need of in your life he's laying aside his splendor my you know when you think of that of how that God chose to do it I'm glad that God came to where he came I'm glad he didn't come where it was great kingly robes on and great you know where it was you know someone that had the same theological and intellect as that of the Pharisees I'm glad it wasn't that way you look at how God would choose to do it friends I you know I'd say what brother say no this is just your thought maybe it is but I look in this hour how that God would choose to use a messenger in this hour that was not intellectual but one who would intent I only be able to stand there think about that wasn't nothing to glory in that you only had a seventh grade education but it showed this message is not the thoughts of man it is not man's thoughts it is God's thoughts of his work man has held his word down through the ages but there's a difference in having his word and knowing his thoughts his mind men have taken words and listen now by their own evil desires subverted words to try to match and complement and okay their evil desires but God releases his thought and in his thought his his own desire his own nature his own life and it doesn't cover over it lets you and I evolve into the realms that God intended for us to walk in that's God's thoughts hallelujah God's thoughts take hold on our life I always think of the Prophet there I could just imagine here you're standing in Philadelphia and why I wanna what a message to preach mighty God unveiled before us in the Philadelphia you ever think about that brother John here he is in Philadelphia where was what was Philadelphia where the great battle was wrong and he would step back with him there that great Liberty Bell and he would say oh think of the tonight the message of the hour the expressed thoughts of Jehovah what is it was the scriptures that are laid here for this hour and Christ himself has come down and rung that word with a certain sound to our eyes and of trolling you and I to himself amen his word always finds its mark always finds his children yes sir notice of how that God laid aside that great splendor God never comes to hell of a flesh but let me just move on here his objective in to redeem is not just to leave you I want you to think of this for a moment how many times out here in the natural I just I've seen a documentary here of a individual where their brother had got out of a prison and the individual had got out of prison and we're talking about it was the whole thing dealing with documentary it was they were talking just things on miracles in their lives and this kind of struck me in I'm just looking at this and as I'm looking at it what what had taken place they let this individual out of out of incarceration they had been incarcerated for many things when they let him out they just gave him a little bit of money and just turned him on the street now I know we can look at that you know you can look at that and I can look at that we can say well I mean there ought to be thankful they're free but the point of it is is that the individual not getting the help they needed they needed help mentally and then what ended up happening is the sister here their sisters and one of the sisters took this individual in her home her brother and because her brother was not balanced the right way he ended up killing her you know I didn't even you know I'm just looking at it didn't strap me to this right here of the things I've been dwelling on God does not just release you and leave you he don't just deliver you he translates you they don't just say hey you're free and then you're looking at which way do I go what direction do I do what's that gonna make next what agency do I go to how do I go to apply for this he don't just leave you like that they man he said I will not leave you comfortless I'll not leave you like a group of orphans amen the house of God is not the house of an orphanage [Applause] his we're sons and daughters are born when sons and daughters well we're the genes of his own life or brought to life with the faith of that I my heart just broke you know and here the individual of the family they're having to deal with what has taken place and be able to forgive you know their brother and forgive those other things and that had been taking place and I you know just taking overhead of God would just quicken it to me right now God does not leave us in that place [Music] let's look at this for a moment the scripture tells us here in the book of Hebrews it became him he meant Almighty God it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things a man this is not this is not a second person and I'm just saying this Lister and some of these things I are not new to you but for all I believe it's to be rehearsed as well as for any that would be new we are not redeemed by second person it was God Himself become one of us God created a body he pitched this tint he created this body to come and step into it with the purpose of death he purposed that that's the whole purpose here the virgin birth there that blood cell could not be a blood cell that was already of a blood that was here it was a polluted blood people were still held in bondage but it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things in bringing many sons unto glory already sons but he's come to bring them to glory and there's only one that can bring sons to glory and that's he himself he met he comes to bring not just not just release but to bring you and I to glory bring you and I into that place that he has for us into that final full reconciliation to where that the reconciling of our soul leads to the reconciling of our bodies and the reconciling of the redeemed ransom all down through the ages and bringing many sons under glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings amen for both he that sanctifies and they who are sanctified are all of one for which calls he is not ashamed to call them brethren God came down and became my brother that's kinfolk he came down and became my brother we were always related are you with me he manifested an attribute of himself that was always there to be savior to be deliver all those things my condition your condition it brought him on the scene to manifest those attributes amen we did not become all of a sudden kinfolk we were always careful and that's why he came was to get his kin he came to get his sons and daughters now notice this verse 12 saying I will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee and again I will put my trust in him and again behold I and the children which God hath given me now notice as it goes on to say in verse 14 for as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage not to think of how this and there's things let me just move on here in just focusing on this purpose of being delivered and translated because when we find that here the Lord Jesus stands in Luke chapter four and he begins to declare when the book the scroll of Isaiah is given to him you know God knew exactly the timing he knew exactly what scroll was needed to be delivered God knew what was going to take place in that moment Jesus didn't walk in and say can I have the scroll of Isaiah it was delivered unto Him God had everything that priests they might hear they were selecting of a certain scroll that morning they didn't realize it but even in that moment it was God that was Orcas reading and bringing them to that and if we can have that realization friends that these things are not happening by chance didn't let us have grace to receive those things and say Lord you who are ordering all things let me receive and recognize and be moved but what you are doing right now Lord I don't want to be deaf to it I don't want to be ignorant to it I don't want to be complacent about it I want to move within it this rook was delivered unto him and he he opened the book but he did more than just open the pages they had opened the book many times but this opening was a different opening he took the same scroll they had read from but that scroll become all together a new scroll it was in his hands when that scroll became middle how did it become new because what was prophesied and that which had been written declared from the mind of God here God who's reflecting his mind down through earth it was God Himself standing there in a corporal body and declaring in this hour this scripture is fulfilled in this hour Amen what authority to point in this hour and say this scripture is being fulfilled he could say the Spirit of the Lord is upon me here's the purpose remember the purpose of his coming the Spirit of the Lord in verse 18 is upon me because he hath anointed me he hath anointed me fourth purpose lucky anointed Aaron lucky anointed his sons they are anointed for a purpose there's not anointing just to come and do whatever they're anointed to serve you and I have been anointed to serve the Living God amen we've been called chosen set apart and anointed by the Holy Ghost to serve the purpose of God in this hour hey man glory be to God he said he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted hallelujah to preach deliverance to the captives this is greater than any natural national force amen this is the lord of glory sounding forth here he is and recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised this is what the Spirit of the Lord moving and bring in an anointing listen friends it doesn't an reconcile a person to a church it reconciles us unto Jesus Christ her ulis me that's where the declaration of a true Messenger of God he could stand there and say there's one desire that I have and that's to see a true relationship between Jesus Christ and his people that was the thrust that's the desire and that's the same burden is that same relationship would so permeate and hold in our lives what you thankful to God for that I'm telling your friends I'm thankful to God for that it's time and I hear the message when I'm reading the word I said take your God that you're sent a word in this hour that was free from denominational influence now let me tell you something even thoughts where you go back and you can study things on the message where the Prophet said I used to think oh my that is a wonderful phrase I used to think there are a lot of those in your lives I used to think I used to believe I used to feel what was it it was the power of Revelation appointed to this hour and it breaks all that darkness and that denominationalism why because it's a cloud of darkness and gloom it is not the true light you know how the Prophet could say I would have made a mistake but he came in the room that same pillar of fire that same pair of eyes and know this is a time for deliverance the understanding back then was fitted for that time but now here's an understanding there must come in this hour a sounding that brings liberty you love him hallelujah oh my think of what took place here at the River Jordan the Prophet said heavens and earth have met God and man is reconciled I restored Eden has begun and all the curses gone that's the greatest thing I was there look the Prophet tells us that's the greatest event is that right but at the opening of the seals he said this taking the book is the most sublime act the greatest act leads to the most sublime it must first be a reconciling there that leads to a full reconciling and calling of all those that are redeemed unto himself it's God making a way for himself to come forth well I says just like all the curse of sin is gone when the Holy Ghost accepts you so you don't accept it it accepts you see cause it's God's attribute in that beautiful you say well brother Samuel didn't know I I thought I accepted it it's him that accepted you but remember he comes and he deals with our hearts and our lives because even in our own spirit we couldn't get along with ourselves much less get along with God but God never said you got to get a new heart a new spirit on your own he said I'll give you what I gotta do just surrender to him I'll give you a new heart I'll give you a new spirit and then I put my spirit in you and calls you to walk in my statutes so it's him receiving us receiving us back to what he already knew and that is breaking upon our lives listen that's why when Paul look how Paul would pray in the first part of Ephesians in the first part of Ephesians 3 Paul would pray this way in the book of Thessalonians and in the chapter 1 Paul would pray this way in the first part of those chapters the Lawsons one an intercessory prayer that's prayed that the people would come to the depth of understanding of what God has done that's why the Prophet could stand there and Christ the mystery said oh he said I'm sure he said I don't understand it the way I need to understand it but you know what God makes it known in his time my question is do you have a desire is a hungry is a desire to know more more who more of him more of him a man oh my you see this this word it comes it removes you and I from just knowing knowing this is the truth it reveals the truth in us glory be to God see if the Holy Ghost means God's Spirit is the attribute the thought of God has accepted you because you are deigned for that purpose yet you was born in sin but God had that attribute and here you expressed yourself on earth and he comes down and get you he comes down and gets you so the purpose of his coming is to come down and get us see you're back here here is where you belong see sin has lost its power the desire of sin has gone from your heart when the Holies parrot comes in let's say no I still fall short but that the wind bring the Holy Ghost has come in the desire of sin is gone from your life you see that's where the Prophet could say in the message thirsty said you know what you are by the desire within your heart amen and only let only let Christ Himself interpret that to you glory be to God Alleluia that's why we want to look in the mirror of his word and then we don't we don't want the Eve's interpreter we want the Holy Spirit to interpret his word in our life is that right listen to me now the word of reconciliation God reconciles that soul unto himself and when the soul has been reconciled it will lead this body into a complete state of reconciliation Amen you're perfect from within God gives you that perfection within to do what bring that outer man in subjection and it's a declaration of his victory in your life are you with me Amen we're at one time there was no struggle in your life you walked according to the Prince of power the air but now something happened then been chained there something moved there's a repulsion against those things somebody with me now oh brother Samuel this don't bother me then there's something wrong sin everything around it bothers the unbeliever bothers the believer there's no desire within your heart for those things you don't even like to stay in a place even in a a break room where you know such things where that things could be said they may not even know that well I don't know if this could be said you don't even want to be around those things why you've been made free and that same God that has made you free is building you up from glory unto glory unto glory hallelujah glory be to God oh my you are a restored person this word restored means you are brought back I know it's simple you are you've written a return to a former conditioned place or position Amen you have been given something that was previously stolen taken away or lost it's back to the original owner let me just let me move with this here this word in Colossians 1:13 can I have just a few more moments verse 13 let me just trying to lay this in here who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son to be delivered as he had drawn us to himself he has rescued us not get a mission where there are people that are taken captive home I think of that one time where they had those you know them hostages were captured and they called them Assad in there of Israel and they went right in there I think it was Libya or whatever more I tell you they pulled right up in there and I remember Sadie's bins and everything else and they had everything and right down to the detail of those men that were in there holding those hostages captive they knew exactly they had the prints they had all this stuff when they went in there they took care of business and those who were held hostage were freed I'm gonna tell you I believe it was more than the intellect of the Mossad I believe that it was God who is with Israel it's God testified I whoever bless you be blessed whoever cursed you will be crushed that applies to you the son and daughter that applies to you you are blessed of the Lord when God has put his blessing of his spirit upon your life and raised you up there is nothing that can stand against the elect of God yes sir everything is precise and its director God himself knew exactly where to go when he came down everything was already laid out he went straight to the head of the serpent men had men all laid out and he came to liberate the captives to heal the brokenhearted amen to bring strength to those who were bruised you know there was a young there was a woman here in John 6 notice this ministry of the acceptable year going forth and here the Lord Jesus he meets this woman there by the well she had been coming to that well been coming to that well but this day this was gonna be a new beginning for her life she was not gonna leave from that well the same way that she came there but through the word the prophecy that had been given for that hour here stands the Messiah and it begins to speak to her notice all this cloud and gloom everything that was covering her life was not who she was if he would have tried to focus on repairing that she too walked away from there the same way are you with me it's not listen friends there are serious needs but the gospel has come to bring what is needed and when God God is alone himself is the one who brings the healing work it's not Reformation or reforming but he brought by the word by the word he stirs her to a place to where she begins to ask him about worship that was God's desire he was seeking for true worshipers to worship Him in spirit Ruth she being an election of God when the Spirit of God moving across God's desire becomes reflected in her request she's requesting what God wants to bring forth in her I see leaves they're delivered and translated she's been moved from one kind of a life to another when God came down to Egypt he came down into Egypt there with a message when he met Moses there and revealed himself in the promise of his word what did God say he said I am come down to deliver them right now come I'm gonna send you I've come to deliver them and bring them up unto a good land see the word had already been spoken it's a good land there should have been no question about the land are you with me but God allows the here go up and see the land but the land has already been declared God has said it's a good land hey man what God has said has spoken it is sure it is true but you see there were many who had been delivered out but they never got translated come on somebody they came out and they walked in the wilderness but then it came to a spot they did not recognize that this message was not Moses message he was an instrument but this was the Lord God revealing himself by his promise and the same God who made this promise real and alive as a same God who would put them in that place you know what that was that was their inheritance by then walking away they declared we have no inheritance here there's got to be something that registers within a heart of a believer and you recognize it just like what God is troweling a person and to himself he's drowning them to recognize there's something that's lacking in their life they might have been a church member for year after year after year but there's something that's missing in their life and they need a real experience with Almighty God and what is it that's something that gives them that but I know that I have there a place a body that is waiting on me I'm not talking about all the lives that Satan wants to tell you I'm not talking about all the things when he wants to tell you well it's not for you it's for everybody else he's a liar you need to stand on that word there can you say stand on what word stand on the word that has been made real and flesh in your life Amen that you know right now you're not walking by mommy and daddy's understanding but you haven't understanding that has come from God that this message is a living reality of the Lord God that had made himself known to me it's not something that's come from a pastor but it's God himself they didn't recognize that but there were those who were delivered and translated they had to wait a little bit on their translation but they had the promise it's coming how you know it's coming I've been delivered I've been delivered I'm gonna be translated there Robert I've been set free I know I'm gonna be translated hey man I know I've been resurrected I'm gonna be raptured is that right Jesus was resurrected and he ruptured his own body whoo what is it a type of his pride in this our resurrection power raising the bridle and the rapture its health from a resurrection in yourself to the rapture and change of the body hallelujah so that coming on the messiah and redeemer was to deliver and translate the people is coming from the natural land into the baptism of the Holy Ghost and from there here we stand in this hour to translate us to take us out of denominationalism to translate us from this spiritual land into that land what land in my father's house are many mansions that same killer fire has returned once again the first Exodus that pillar of fire was here the second Exodus the pillar fire was here and the pillar fire had been gone from the church but now it returns great signification in this hour listen to me he appeared through many lights and many dreams down through the church ages are you with me he appeared to Abraham in lights and dreams and visions and things but in the end time the pillar fire comes on the scene once again but it's time to be led out of this old world out of this old past house aren't you glad he just doesn't deliver you and leave you and that right but here even in the departing than one of the departing messages God be with you till we meet again leadership leadership has come is that right the leadership of the person of eternal life himself Jesus Christ Oh glory be to God my delivered and translated here think of this here how that you have those within the hour like you take Ruth Ruth was delivered and she was translated she were delivered from from that nation that she walked in her first husband he died she comes into the land with Naomi but then she can never be translated without boys but Boaz the Lord of the harvest comes on the scene and the chief Reaper notice Boaz doesn't go to anybody else but the chief Reaper you don't just go around and ask him all the others who is this he comes to the chief Reaper who is she the chief Reaper knows who she is the chief of chief Reaper says this is Ruth what's he doing he's presenting Ruth to him longer it be to God Alleluia and Ruth is translated oh my she was already always she was ordained there in the economy when you read Matthew chapter 1 when the Bible says the generation of Jesus Christ not generations the generation of Jesus Christ she's translated not all of a sudden inserted she was always there in that whole lineage the whole time but now she's been translated to where what is laid within her can now begin to express itself it's positioning Rahab she was delivered she received a word of impending judgment there right there are messengers who win and they were packing the message of Joshua is there right they were packing a message that held within it the inheritance they're packing a message that helped within it power authority to place and here she is an alien she's without the economy of Israel she absolutely has not one promise that she could lay hold upon in that land but little did she know that she also is a part of the economy of God and God sees to it that his word of deliverance comes to her heart and she receives that word and applies it listen friends it's not how much you know just apply what God had showed you apply what he showed you be faithful in that and watch as you apply that word God will bring you along amen and here when all of the walls came down here she meets and marries salmone he's not just delivered she's now transferred she's come what from one place into another at one place she was an outcast but by a word that came to make her ready a word that came to make her ready she received that word and that word made her ready he delivered her so she could be translated glory be to God the desire from being delivered to being translated Sarah was delivered and translated also now right I'm done let's tan once again I don't get to the place we want but God knows I want to get to where he wants is that right that's where I want to get to where he wants I trust that this morning we can see you can see more of yourself see you and me all we know is our first birth as far as we have all this recollection and you see everything but God God makes way and makes known to you that your new birth it was not coincidence it was not accident it was not something that anybody cultured in to you or schooled into you it was predestinated into you by the hand of God God came and sought you out he delivered you he broke the power of darkness from around your life and translated you into the kingdom of his dear son and as being and dwelling in the kingdom of his dear son you are a ruler you understand that you're a ruler we are made kings and priests unto our God by the blood of Jesus Christ yes sir you and I are called not only to offer worship unto the Lord as priests unto God priests are what set aside for service right to offer unto God but we're also Kings as well earthly man tried to mix that office you can't mix it or an under earthly strength it must be a divine strength right Uriah being a king tried to intrude into a priests office can't do it it must stay in his position but you and I here we are by the grace of God through and by the Prince of the kings of the earth we're not intruding into something we are thorned into this kingdom we are born kings and priests not what we made ourselves it's not something that we all of a sudden I want to be this it's God opening and bringing us into that place that he always had for us and that kingship is a ruling over sin flesh the devil the world it's a reality it's a truth you see Sarah in her life here look how the word came to Sarah God's dealing with Abraham he's dealing with Abraham's life but then Sarah Sarah herself had to be delivered and when she was delivered she came remember here the word comes and the word always exposes our humanity our weakness is that right that's what I want the word to do I don't want the word to tell me how strong I am because that that's not true I want the word to show me where my weak places are so that those weak places can be submitted to him so that he might become strong in him you say well but if you're weakened and wouldn't be natural God would be strong in it no not if pride tries to cover him but see when pride gets removed and recognized he's here to help us then we can submit those weaknesses that he might be strong those no longer something we're trying to hide and protect but we submitted unto God but here the word of the Lord comes and Sarah's she says how is this gonna be is she's still thinking on a natural earthly level but the word has come to lift her out of that realm and here she comes and we find where there is a change within Sarah not only is her name been changed I noticed Nelly has her name been changed but now what God will do is bring forth from within her that removal of what she didn't think possible God brought forth you with me think about what the Spirit of God has spoke to us even on faith my brother Jerry stood right here faith possessing the unknown are you with me this time I know I got faith faith is an unconscious thing hey there's another I know remember how many times where people are sitting there out there over and over and and God would allow those things to be recorded in tape he says you were healed just moments ago sister I said you didn't know you had that he didn't know that God knew Sara didn't know she had that much faith but God knew but what did the world do it didn't condemn her he lifted her lifted her by what by her union with the word that had come in that hour she received that faith that had come through Abraham she received it and this is where the scripture could say she judged him faithful through those Sarah past age was delivered she was normally delivered she was translated this is God's desire for us it's God's desire he don't just leave us he doesn't just deliver us and then just leave us just say well you're delivered know if the word comes to put us into position it comes to place us in him it comes to declare and live itself out through our lives when God anointed Joshua and Joshua moved by then it's that same inspiration that fell upon Jacob that had fallen upon those Hebrew mothers that had been clear back there from the foundation row they were in that same channel of divine inspiration and so there was impartation that was taking place of the inheritance that belonged to her that's why it's a car in different ones they can never take another place another person's position in the body it's by the allotment and choosing of Almighty God and it comes forth in that time in that season is that right you see that delivery that's where the Prophet would bring us into this place and he would tell us concerning even in this hour this is an hour where it's not just the chemistry but it's the time personal life of Jesus Christ Mini as he said can live he said this is an hour what a great is that a great deceiving hour many can live above drinking and smoking and adultery and all those things he said and still not with it how could they be not with it because listen by grace through faith are you saved they're safe they're free from those things but to be translated is where that this this Christ this Living God has become real to you it is the word of this hour you look for it all brother Simon what would be the evidence the Prophet stands and Feast of Trumpets he says that hearing that word listen not just hearing it and saying oh yeah I believe it yeah I agree with it but hearing where it is that which has made person you he said and that is the evidence of the Holy Ghost to do what receive it what is to receive it to make it yours this is mine this is my inheritance this is my inherit this is your inheritance all all that God is I was he poured into Christ all this is God's desire for us delivered in translating walking in a newness you can never go back to the same where place you were and one of these days we'll never come back you know what this might be the final service it might be the final service it might be the final moment all better say you're trying to scare me that shouldn't scare you we're not trying to play spooky games like around the fire something like that no no we're not talking about that I'm saying that this is an hour of preparation and God has sent for the word of preparation like he did to Rahab like he did for Ruth like he did for Sarah God prepares for himself let's bow our head anyone want to be remembered in prayer Heavenly Father Lord you you see the needs Lord Father behind the hands Lord we're thankful we we rejoice Lord and what you have done and what you are doing Lord we are so thankful God for your word that you but send down here Oh God and you would speak to us Lord this is words of comfort words of strength Lord even Lord one that doesn't know you it's a word not that a word lacks power it's a word of strength Lord that father as we can receive of the word God Lord and yield to that Lord and say be it unto me according to that word your God to know that that word as it is received Lord right there in that moment can Lord bring the deliverance that's needed and translate that life all together father Lord Jesus as you separate Lord you move upon our lives Lord separating us all god from the fashions of this age and of this world separating us O God from all of these things and the uncleanness lord god of this age Lord father the desire Lord we want to walk worthy of the vocation of which we are called life as Paul would speak to those Lord God has been placed in the land in our inheritance he would be mindful Lord to tell us by the leadership of the Spirit of God how we ought to walk your prophet Lord picks that up Lord God through the message of the adoption series and speaking God of how that we are to walk in this land in our inheritance I pray Heavenly Father that if there is one that's here Lord that doesn't know you this morning I pray that God through the word may they Lord God I pray that Lord that they have been brought to a place Lord yielding in their life been brought to a place to say yes Lord I want to be that Lord I want to be that kind of a man that kind of a woman Lord won't grant that word Lord

determined and so Lord determined with submission Lord that we might receive more of you Lord I want more Lord of you as the Prophet Lord said there in the message images of Christ he said oh my I

drama the unfolding of it Lord and and and we're looking at it and we're seeing the word that's to be fulfilled we're minded to understand that beside that word is in parentheses Lord with that italicized print that gives the unction of how that word is to be carried out and father we sense the unction in a heart Lord that God it is not us to carry it out but Lord it is us to yield and you
