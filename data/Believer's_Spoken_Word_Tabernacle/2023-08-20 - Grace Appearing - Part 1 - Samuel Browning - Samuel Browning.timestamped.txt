[33:19] dress
[33:21] dress like such a love
[33:24] such wondrous love
[33:30] [Music]
[33:36] like this
[33:41] amen
[33:43] can you say Amen to that
[33:46] well that was weak you must not have had
[33:48] your Wheaties this morning I said isn't
[33:51] that wonderful
[33:53] amen the love of God Amen how wonderful
[33:56] he is amen how great how great is his
[34:00] mercy and his grace to us
[34:02] amen we're just going to let you have
[34:04] your seats here just for a moment
[34:06] um
[34:08] sorry I don't mean to have you uh up and
[34:11] down and uh
[34:13] but I want to say that it's just a
[34:16] the Lord has given us such a wonderful
[34:18] day and a wonderful time here to be
[34:21] together this morning and just so
[34:24] appreciate amend the worship and knowing
[34:27] that that God is in control amen every
[34:30] time that we come together there's
[34:32] something that is good that's going to
[34:35] happen
[34:36] amen and sometimes it's not always
[34:38] together what we feel or what we see but
[34:40] he never did ask us do you feel it or do
[34:43] you see it
[34:44] do you believe it
[34:46] because the word has power transforming
[34:49] power within it that when that word is
[34:51] received the word will perform what it
[34:55] said it will do in our lives and you
[34:59] think of that even in many different
[35:00] instances in the prophets meetings where
[35:04] he would speak concerning that there
[35:06] were people sitting there who even in
[35:09] the midst of that moment thought that
[35:11] they did not have the faith that was
[35:13] needed to receive their healing
[35:15] but then how you would hear the prophet
[35:18] would say you didn't think you had
[35:20] enough faith for your healing it just
[35:23] goes to show us more and more very
[35:26] simple things that we hear but you know
[35:28] they become more endeared to our hearts
[35:30] that it's not us and that doesn't mean
[35:33] that we just you know just sitting
[35:35] around it just shows the supernatural
[35:37] just God just engaging and just get
[35:39] focused on him and when we're focused on
[35:42] him there's a direct connection between
[35:44] that inner man and him
[35:46] Supernatural things that's taking place
[35:49] beyond what we even and ourselves think
[35:51] because sometimes we think it's all
[35:53] about our mind but God looks upon the
[35:56] heart
[35:57] then you find different ones that
[35:59] brother Brahm said they they were the
[36:01] same way in the meeting and he said
[36:02] after the service after the meeting was
[36:04] over days later they witnessed the
[36:07] effect of the word in their life and
[36:10] they were healed
[36:11] amen the same way that brother Branham
[36:14] when he prayed for different ones at the
[36:15] end of the adoption series and they're
[36:17] Desiring the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[36:19] he said you just keep your eyes on and
[36:21] he said and you'll see it he said you'll
[36:23] watch your life and how that your life
[36:26] will change amen because it's a promise
[36:28] that God made
[36:30] and that's what we're focused on is him
[36:32] and that's that's the whole purpose when
[36:34] we when we come together like this it's
[36:37] that we might see him
[36:40] that's the whole purpose that we've come
[36:42] together we want to see him we want to
[36:44] draw from him we all have needs in our
[36:47] lives and we need to hear from him
[36:50] and we've come here I believe every one
[36:52] of us we've come with the purpose I
[36:54] trust we have and that desire is this
[36:56] Lord I want to be more like you amen I
[36:59] want my life to be further changed I
[37:01] want everything to be in line with you
[37:04] Lord
[37:04] and we certainly I want to leave as a
[37:07] better Christian than when I came in
[37:09] here amen with a greater determination
[37:11] Amen on my heart and life and and so
[37:14] this morning I I know that um
[37:18] for parents and things like that we had
[37:20] canceled the youth meeting there at our
[37:22] home the other
[37:23] uh on Friday evening and uh it certainly
[37:26] wasn't because of uh my wife or anything
[37:28] we just thought there's been a lot
[37:30] that's dealed with sickness you know
[37:32] after camp and it's not just here I know
[37:33] that you know if you're over there for
[37:35] brother Nathaniel's different ones um
[37:37] and you know we were some together on
[37:39] Monday evening and you know they were
[37:41] talking about some of the sickness and
[37:43] things they had just been through and so
[37:45] it's just kind of everywhere and
[37:49] um you know so my wife you know this
[37:51] morning she wasn't she hadn't been uh
[37:53] really kind of battling throughout the
[37:55] week but you know sometimes you have
[37:56] drainage and things like that and so I
[37:59] know different ones and uh but she's not
[38:01] here with me and I told her this morning
[38:03] you know she had was able to go to the
[38:06] clinic and and see them you know when
[38:08] they first opened and uh so I I just
[38:11] really miss it when she's not here with
[38:12] me I love all of you all I love seeing
[38:15] you but there's just nothing like having
[38:17] my wife with me
[38:19] it's just like when I say when I go to
[38:21] different places to Ministry just
[38:23] something about it I like having her
[38:25] here with me and so we just want to just
[38:28] just keep her in prayer in different
[38:30] ones and and also I think was there a
[38:34] prayer request for sister Michelle I
[38:35] don't know who read them okay so we want
[38:38] to keep her in in prayer because of the
[38:41] infection that's there in her toe that
[38:44] that um
[38:46] where the bleeding on her toe uh you
[38:50] know cut something a pretty deep cut and
[38:53] it's it's traveling there up the lake
[38:54] and so they put you know how when they
[38:56] put that Mark there on the leg and it
[38:58] doesn't look good but we you know
[39:01] she's in good hands because she's in
[39:03] God's hands and so we just want to just
[39:05] continue to keep our sister in prayer
[39:07] the Lord will strengthen her in a very
[39:10] uh a special way that God will touch her
[39:12] and I know that brother Bobby and
[39:14] Chrissy have also been dealing with some
[39:17] things as well we want to just say to
[39:21] sister Judith and brother Vivian and I
[39:24] know that brother Constantine's not here
[39:25] but they you heard the request on
[39:27] Thursday and they they
[39:30] um I don't want to say they lost their
[39:31] father I want to say that their father
[39:33] went on home to be with the Lord because
[39:36] when they're serving the lord we don't
[39:38] lose anything
[39:39] they're they're there standing in God's
[39:42] presence and I was speaking you know
[39:44] just even to Sister Judith the other day
[39:46] and then even with
[39:48] brother Vivian brother Constantine just
[39:50] uh expressing things to them as well
[39:53] that you know their father he was he was
[39:55] 84 is is that correct
[39:57] your father was 84 years old
[40:00] 82. and uh so and he was pastoring and
[40:04] he had pastored for I think 20 years
[40:07] and so
[40:08] um you know I just think of that holding
[40:12] this message this glorious gospel and uh
[40:15] you know brother Branham said it like
[40:17] this and I I don't want anybody to
[40:19] interpret this in the wrong way but in
[40:20] there's a man that can turn on the light
[40:22] there was a sister who passed away very
[40:25] suddenly like that and brother Bram says
[40:27] what that is he says he said it must not
[40:30] have been anything that was against her
[40:33] because God gave Grace just to slip
[40:35] right out now that doesn't mean that if
[40:37] anybody has to suffer that there's
[40:39] something against her but I think you
[40:41] know what is it that if God would allow
[40:43] someone to even if there's something to
[40:46] linger you know what it does it causes
[40:48] us to examine everything and you know
[40:51] what that is that's the grace of God
[40:53] that's the grace of God and you know to
[40:56] me if someone if it they're in a place
[40:58] and they're dying and they're passing
[41:00] and it comes to that place and they
[41:01] reach out and say
[41:03] forgive me and the reaching out to this
[41:05] hey forgiveness is something that is
[41:08] resides in the heart of the believer
[41:10] that's what Paul said is that true it's
[41:12] Christ in us and so to me that's that's
[41:15] tremendous you know and to me that's
[41:17] God's grace it's the grace of God for us
[41:19] to even exit out of this body in that
[41:21] way but I I just want to say that to
[41:23] them we we love you all and we're
[41:25] continuing to pray amen God would
[41:28] strengthen them because sister Judith
[41:30] also just recently here within under two
[41:33] years you know she had lost her husband
[41:34] and so we just want to remember them in
[41:38] prayer that God will continue to
[41:40] strengthen them during this time
[41:42] and give them strength throughout these
[41:45] moments and I think that I know that God
[41:47] does give us the strength that we have
[41:49] because we're going to admit you know
[41:50] they will miss them just like when we
[41:52] miss loved ones they'll miss them on
[41:54] this side but there's a comfort that we
[41:56] can draw from to know they're standing
[41:58] right there amen as a matter of fact
[42:01] just that moment there's just that quick
[42:03] of a changing of a dimension it goes
[42:05] that quick it moves into that place and
[42:07] so I was telling sister Judith the other
[42:09] day I said I wonder I said of all the
[42:12] different ones converts and different
[42:14] ones that we're waiting at the river
[42:16] for when your father crossed
[42:19] amen I still think of that sister
[42:21] Miranda when you didn't know that my
[42:23] father was passing that night and you
[42:25] had a dream that brother Louis came to
[42:27] you and he was all dressed up and you
[42:29] said Louie where are you going he said
[42:31] I'm going to a special men's meeting
[42:33] tonight
[42:37] amen
[42:39] scripture you know the Bible said Jacob
[42:41] he will be gathered with his people and
[42:44] God makes a way and you know it's just
[42:46] brother Bram says God knows that
[42:47] Crossing is going to be hard he said but
[42:49] God just makes a way and brother Branham
[42:52] expressed it in this way and and I think
[42:55] of my dad sitting there and when he had
[42:58] that little that drainage of his lungs
[43:01] remember you said it felt like a little
[43:02] bee sting brother Brown talks about how
[43:04] that even when we pass from Death it's
[43:06] just a quick little sting and we're gone
[43:09] I'm glad that he took the big sting out
[43:12] of it aren't you
[43:13] [Applause]
[43:15] but while we're here in this life amen
[43:18] while we're here we're going to keep
[43:20] pressing and there's a desire in your
[43:22] life you say I I want to stay right here
[43:24] you know well there's work for us
[43:26] there's work to be done amen and the God
[43:28] desires to do more in our life we've all
[43:31] here for a purpose and and so we want to
[43:33] serve that purpose I just want to also
[43:35] welcome visitors that we have here Josh
[43:38] and Mariah God bless you good to see you
[43:40] amen and sister Mr pansy God bless you
[43:43] and the sister Doris
[43:46] no
[43:47] two
[43:51] forgive me
[43:53] you all look so much alike
[43:57] so I guess you can't blame one another
[43:58] on that you just got to blame Mom and
[44:00] Dad right
[44:01] but that's a compliment as well I I just
[44:04] my mind was thinking I knew that it was
[44:06] from here but God bless you Sister Wilma
[44:09] it's so good to have you here with us
[44:10] amen and uh different ones amen God
[44:13] bless you I want to have um if we could
[44:16] I want to have special prayer with those
[44:19] of of teachers that we would have here
[44:21] today
[44:22] and as our students and different ones
[44:25] are preparing to go back to school and
[44:27] my we certainly need the grace of God
[44:29] Amen as they're walking amen the
[44:32] students teachers and parents and you
[44:35] know throughout the time you know I know
[44:37] even as a parent I thought that when you
[44:40] know I stepped away from teaching I
[44:42] wouldn't look forward to the end of the
[44:43] year I still look forward to the end of
[44:45] the school year I look forward to a
[44:48] great anticipation so but you know I
[44:53] think you know certainly it's the grace
[44:54] of God and you know I think of how when
[44:56] Moses when his his mother you know she
[45:00] she nursed him for those three months
[45:03] but there was a promise that God gave
[45:05] her
[45:06] and when she committed Moses there upon
[45:10] that in that little Ark she sent him out
[45:12] upon the Water but she had a comfort
[45:15] because she held a promise that an angel
[45:17] of the Lord had come there
[45:20] to her husband and had confirmed that
[45:22] promise and so she had a comfort I tell
[45:25] you there's a lot of there's a lot of
[45:27] things if you dwell on it that's out
[45:28] there in the world that can be very
[45:31] scary
[45:32] I know we have some Public School
[45:33] homeschool and so forth college but let
[45:36] me just say this to you just keep your
[45:38] eyes on him
[45:40] as you walk in those schools as colleges
[45:42] and so forth Just say God help me to get
[45:45] what I need to get
[45:48] and then just to move on
[45:50] Lord I don't want to get caught up in
[45:52] the things that are around but let me
[45:53] help me to keep my eyes on you and let
[45:55] my light let the light of Christ shine
[45:57] through me amen because that's a
[46:00] wonderful thing that God would work
[46:03] through your life and and that's what we
[46:05] want we want to just ask God's blessing
[46:07] and protection and sometimes there's a
[46:09] lot of things that might seem like you
[46:11] know especially with the day and age
[46:12] that we're living in sometimes there's a
[46:15] awful
[46:16] lot it's like awful lot of junk that you
[46:19] have to weed through it'd be like
[46:21] somebody bringing you a steak and you
[46:22] remember how they used to put parsley on
[46:24] your plates maybe there's a restaurant
[46:27] that still does that to me I always
[46:28] thought it's
[46:30] I didn't order it because you were
[46:31] putting parsley odor because it was
[46:32] steak
[46:34] but it'd be like having a whole plate of
[46:36] parsley
[46:38] and one little piece of steak
[46:40] I'm not going to eat the parsley get it
[46:42] off the plate and it's the steak
[46:44] so there might be many times in classes
[46:47] and a lot of things there could be a
[46:49] whole lot of parsley
[46:51] you say God help me to get that little
[46:52] piece that I need
[46:54] because God knows what he listen God
[46:56] knows what he's placed in you as young
[46:58] people and those skills that are there
[47:00] God's already placed them in there and
[47:03] it's not a teacher or anybody else that
[47:04] puts them it's just God coming it makes
[47:06] you aware of those things that's already
[47:08] into you as much with scripture I could
[47:10] preach on that but it's very true and so
[47:13] when we look at this let's just look to
[47:15] God and I ask that if the different ones
[47:18] teachers parents students
[47:20] if you'd like to come forward right now
[47:22] unless let's just have a time of special
[47:25] prayer together and I'd like all of you
[47:27] to to join in with us Amen in prayer
[47:31] amen
[47:35] amen amen let's just as we all just join
[47:39] together

[47:45] and that's it just come on him

[47:51] amen
[47:52] I sure loved you all
[47:55] amen
[47:56] God bless you amen

[51:01] Hallelujah
[51:02] if we could let's just stand
[51:11] I just like to go to
[51:15] Titus Chapter 2.
[51:37] and I'm just going to read their
[51:41] at verse 11.
[51:45] I want to say also sister Caroline
[51:47] forgive me I said here and I have seen
[51:48] you even
[51:50] smiling as I've been talking throughout
[51:52] welcome home
[51:54] welcome home brother Alex God bless you
[51:57] it's good to have you here too
[51:58] amen
[52:01] verse 11.
[52:06] verse 11 of Titus Chapter 2.
[52:13] for the grace of God
[52:15] that bringeth salvation
[52:19] hath appeared
[52:21] to all men
[52:23] teaching us that denying ungodliness and
[52:28] worldly lust we should live soberly
[52:32] righteously and godly in this present
[52:36] world
[52:37] looking for that blessed hope
[52:40] and the Glorious appearing of the great
[52:44] God and our Savior Jesus Christ who gave
[52:48] himself for us that he might redeem us
[52:52] from all iniquity
[52:55] and purify unto himself
[52:59] A peculiar people zealous of good works
[53:04] amen may God bless you and bless the
[53:06] reading of the word as you're being
[53:07] seated
[53:10] probably with all the up and down you
[53:12] feel like you've got your exercise
[53:15] maybe that'll give you another excuse
[53:17] for another role or another hamburger
[53:19] today
[53:22] but I just want to
[53:24] just speak here
[53:26] actually fought the title that it was
[53:28] going to take
[53:30] but the Lord just seemed to just just
[53:31] just change some things a little bit
[53:33] here this morning in prayer not so much
[53:37] that what I have before me but the
[53:39] thought
[53:40] within behind it
[53:42] and I want to just speak here this
[53:45] morning just really drawing from these
[53:47] verses of scripture
[53:49] upon the thought of Grace appearing
[53:53] Grace appearing
[53:55] and in Titus 2 11 I'm going to read this
[53:59] from the Amplified version here and it
[54:02] simply means for the grace of God this
[54:05] is how that verse is written for the
[54:07] grace of God his unmerited favor and
[54:11] blessing has come forward which means it
[54:16] has appeared for the deliverance from
[54:20] sin and the Eternal salvation For All
[54:25] Mankind
[54:27] so
[54:28] that when we look at this of Grace
[54:31] itself and that of appearing the word
[54:34] appear here it means to to to give light
[54:39] to something or to bring to light or to
[54:42] appear or become visible
[54:45] you know many of you have seen this out
[54:47] here right now if you look sometimes
[54:49] during the day at certain times of the
[54:51] month you you can be looking in the sky
[54:53] and all of a sudden you'll see oh there
[54:55] there's the moon and it's pretty faint
[54:57] but it's you can see it but as the as
[55:00] the time goes on and the day is passing
[55:03] the moon itself will come into that
[55:05] place of an evening where it's very
[55:07] visible and so when we're looking at
[55:09] this here of the grace of God the grace
[55:12] of God appearing is where God's grace
[55:14] itself becomes visible and so to become
[55:18] known or to clearly show oneself and
[55:23] Paul picks this up in second Timothy
[55:25] chapter 1 and verse 8 and he says be not
[55:29] therefore ashamed of the testimony of
[55:33] Our Lord nor of me his prisoner now I
[55:37] want you to understand that Paul's when
[55:39] he's talking of the testimony of Our
[55:41] Lord
[55:42] he's not speaking of just someone giving
[55:46] testimony of works that were done in the
[55:50] life of the Lord Jesus but he's dealing
[55:52] with the testimony of Our Lord speaking
[55:55] of God's own life of what he did in the
[56:00] body of Jesus Christ in that Corporal
[56:03] body he is doing the same thing and has
[56:07] witnessed the same thing through that
[56:10] Ministry and so as you have believed be
[56:14] not therefore ashamed of the testimony
[56:16] of Our Lord because Satan would not care
[56:20] how much that we could speak or just to
[56:25] a rehearse testimonies of the of him of
[56:29] God's grace appearing to us or to the
[56:33] lives of others but what Satan wants to
[56:35] keep every life from is Grace appearing
[56:39] in you
[56:40] that's his that's his desire is to hold
[56:44] that back and so notice the testimony of
[56:47] Our Lord nor of me his prisoner so we
[56:50] all know that it's never been that
[56:52] Christ himself uh and when I say Christ
[56:55] I'm talking of the anointing all the way
[56:58] down the scripture says even in Isaiah
[57:00] 53 he is despised and rejected now this
[57:05] is before the manifestation in that
[57:08] Corporal body that we know as Jesus
[57:10] before the human name was ever expressed
[57:13] but it was always despised every time
[57:16] that Christ himself would begin to
[57:19] reveal himself it was a portion that was
[57:21] revealed in Noah he made himself known
[57:24] through Abraham all the way down and as
[57:27] he was making himself known through each
[57:29] of them it was the Believers the elect
[57:32] of that hour that were affected by that
[57:36] appearing and at that appearing they
[57:39] themselves not only witness that
[57:42] appearing but they became partakers of
[57:45] that appearing in their own lives they
[57:48] became a part of the grace that was
[57:50] appearing to them so this is where Paul
[57:53] said do not be ashamed of the testimony
[57:55] of Our Lord nor of me as prisoner but be
[57:58] thou a partaker of the afflictions of
[58:01] The Gospel According to the power of God
[58:05] who hath saved us and called us with a
[58:09] holy calling not according to our works
[58:14] now remember brother Brandon when we
[58:16] were dealing with some weeks ago in the
[58:19] depths of God's grace when we were
[58:20] speaking upon that you or I when God
[58:24] deals with our heart it's not us trying
[58:26] to Merit God's grace
[58:29] there's no way possible that you and I
[58:32] can Merit anything of God
[58:36] the grace of God is that which is we are
[58:40] undeserving but God steps forward to
[58:44] make himself known and then we believe
[58:48] that expression
[58:51] is that right that's that's the true
[58:54] works within it all because a person can
[58:57] work and work and work and work and they
[58:59] can do a lot of works but they're still
[59:01] empty on the inside the Rich Young Ruler
[59:04] was that way he was very empty he said
[59:06] there's one thing that I lack yet he had
[59:08] done a lot of he had done all of the all
[59:10] of the Commandments and but yet he
[59:12] realized he was lacking and what he was
[59:14] lacking was the most important thing and
[59:16] that was the Living God he was lacking
[59:20] eternal life so it's not Paul is not
[59:23] speaking against work he's just saying
[59:25] God did not look down and call you and I
[59:29] because of our works so God's Not In
[59:33] other words if I can give this simple
[59:34] illustration you know I remember being
[59:37] in uh uh uh you know in elementary
[59:39] school and sometimes you know there were
[59:41] a few things here or there you know that
[59:43] you could be you know kind of good at
[59:45] you know in different things and and so
[59:46] you know when they line you up on the
[59:48] wall and back then in those days we had
[59:50] three recesses where I went and man that
[59:52] was a blessing uh you know we had
[59:54] 15-minute recess and then the recess
[59:56] after lunch but my point I'm getting to
[59:58] is that many times you know we I enjoyed
[1:00:00] playing football during that time you
[1:00:02] know and then enjoyed playing kickball I
[1:00:04] always enjoyed those two things but you
[1:00:06] know when we would go to to to start
[1:00:08] lining up you know they line you up on
[1:00:10] the wall kind of like gym class and they
[1:00:11] say Okay count off you know a b a b or
[1:00:14] whatever more and you know sometimes you
[1:00:16] see the a b a b and you know how it is
[1:00:18] that people they go
[1:00:21] if you give the kids long enough they'll
[1:00:23] sort themselves out so while they hey
[1:00:25] switch places with me here switch places
[1:00:26] with me here you know because they're
[1:00:28] looking at and I want this person on my
[1:00:29] team Hannah I want this person on my
[1:00:31] team or or you know that then this one
[1:00:33] you know or if you're just chosen you
[1:00:34] know they have two people and they pick
[1:00:36] the teams I'll pick this one and this
[1:00:37] one then and you know you what you're
[1:00:39] trying to do is you you're wanting to
[1:00:41] try to assemble the best team
[1:00:43] and I I use that example to say it like
[1:00:46] this that God himself did not Choose You
[1:00:50] and I based on any works or abilities
[1:00:56] that's Romans 9 according to the
[1:00:58] election of God before Jacob or Esau any
[1:01:03] had done anything
[1:01:06] God chose Jacob before the foundation
[1:01:10] world and that choosing is actually
[1:01:14] Jacob was in Christ the whole time Jacob
[1:01:19] was ordained to be part of the
[1:01:22] expression of God's grace and that's why
[1:01:25] brother Brandon when you hear him preach
[1:01:27] the message Masterpiece and he's dealing
[1:01:28] with the four pedestals that the actual
[1:01:32] body is built upon and you know those
[1:01:34] those four pedestals that are there
[1:01:37] where you have that of you know of um uh
[1:01:39] it goes through of of of the the
[1:01:42] election of God and then dealing in
[1:01:45] Abraham and then the love of God in
[1:01:46] Isaac and then he comes to Jacob and he
[1:01:49] says and Jacob represents the grace of
[1:01:51] God and I like how brother Graham says
[1:01:52] he said anybody reads the life of Jacob
[1:01:54] you got to know the grace of God and I'm
[1:01:58] not just talking about before he
[1:02:00] wrestled with the angel I'm talking
[1:02:01] about after he wrestled with the angel
[1:02:04] too and then you have the fourth part
[1:02:06] Joseph is perfection that's where the
[1:02:08] body it rests upon those upon that
[1:02:12] pedestal and so we recognize that Jacob
[1:02:14] even like that the grace of God came to
[1:02:17] him and then that Grace appeared not
[1:02:20] only appearing to him when it came to
[1:02:22] Bethel but then that Grace moved down
[1:02:25] into Jacob's life and it brought a
[1:02:27] transformation to where that Prince that
[1:02:30] Israel on the inside became revealed and
[1:02:34] it took the presence of the Angel of the
[1:02:36] Lord moving in Jacob's life now I want
[1:02:38] you to notice this that lay in Jacob the
[1:02:41] whole time
[1:02:43] but it took a time to wear that
[1:02:46] everything around Jacob Laban
[1:02:48] father-in-law all those right there he
[1:02:50] saw their countenance changed towards
[1:02:52] him it was God calling him back to the
[1:02:55] place of Bethel where God had in his
[1:02:58] grace had made himself known to Jacob
[1:03:01] Jacob didn't go to Bethel because he
[1:03:04] thought I'm going to go seek God no he
[1:03:07] was tired on his journey going to get a
[1:03:10] wife
[1:03:11] right and into him Bethel was like
[1:03:13] Bethel is be like any other city that we
[1:03:16] would think of but you see God had a
[1:03:19] special appointment for Jacob and it was
[1:03:21] the grace of God not any of Jarrett
[1:03:24] Jacob's merits that God's grace stepped
[1:03:27] on the scene and made himself known to
[1:03:29] Jacob that I am the god of thy father
[1:03:32] Abraham
[1:03:33] then he calls him back to that place and
[1:03:36] Jacob is in a place where he comes into
[1:03:39] desperation that there there is a need
[1:03:42] in his life in other words if I can say
[1:03:44] it like this Jacob was tired of being
[1:03:47] Jacob
[1:03:50] that that
[1:03:51] of Israel lay in his life the whole time
[1:03:55] is that right because when he wrestled
[1:03:57] with the angel of the Lord the scripture
[1:04:00] says that he blessed him there when
[1:04:03] Jacob asked for who are you tell me your
[1:04:08] name I want to know who you are and
[1:04:12] remember he touched him and he said he
[1:04:14] blessed him there it was not talking
[1:04:16] about a physical location God blessed
[1:04:20] him there it was in that area of his
[1:04:24] life though the blessing had been
[1:04:26] pronounced over him by the prophet of
[1:04:29] the hour Isaac is that right the
[1:04:31] blessing had been pronounced over him
[1:04:33] but he had to come into the realities of
[1:04:38] that blessing and Jacob was desperate
[1:04:41] and there in his life upon that part
[1:04:45] that was from God there he blessed him
[1:04:49] there
[1:04:51] and then Jacob's life becomes a display
[1:04:55] of God's grace walking in flesh
[1:05:00] I may be a little ahead of myself but
[1:05:02] I'm just following him I it's not about
[1:05:04] me it's about him so not according to
[1:05:06] our works not according to our own Works
[1:05:09] everybody with me
[1:05:10] but according to his own purpose
[1:05:14] Grace
[1:05:18] remember as we said before in depths of
[1:05:20] God's grace God's Grace has been
[1:05:22] standing for us even before we even
[1:05:25] recognized it
[1:05:27] it's been standing and even with things
[1:05:30] that we in ourselves were not even fully
[1:05:32] aware of yet Grace was standing there
[1:05:34] and waiting and it was holding for you
[1:05:36] and I
[1:05:39] because why God won't lose one
[1:05:43] why because you have to understand
[1:05:45] you're not something separate from the
[1:05:47] word you don't all together on a certain
[1:05:49] day become the word but when the Holy
[1:05:52] Spirit comes then you become the word
[1:05:54] made flesh
[1:05:57] it's the quickening power that comes
[1:06:01] upon your life to transform your life to
[1:06:04] bring that word life into expression
[1:06:08] so you you as the prophet puts it like
[1:06:11] this in Christ the mystery says when he
[1:06:14] has taken the book he said remember you
[1:06:17] are the words of the book
[1:06:19] [Music]
[1:06:20] so when God is taken here now in this
[1:06:23] hour the lamb taking the book it's
[1:06:26] signifying of Christ taking a hold of
[1:06:29] the life of the believer in this hour
[1:06:31] and it's not just he doesn't
[1:06:33] individually but it's also Christ
[1:06:36] himself coming to take a hold of his
[1:06:39] bride and let me tell you the whole that
[1:06:42] Christ has upon our life is not like the
[1:06:45] hold of a man but it is the hold of his
[1:06:48] Amazing Grace it is the love of God that
[1:06:52] is shed abroad in our hearts it's Christ
[1:06:55] himself stepping forward
[1:06:59] so it's according to his own purpose and
[1:07:02] Grace so there is none of us that have
[1:07:04] any bragging rights on our own selves
[1:07:08] notice he which was given us in Christ
[1:07:11] Jesus before the world began
[1:07:17] but is now main manifest so what was
[1:07:22] it's just like the things that we're
[1:07:24] seeing now the things you see in your
[1:07:26] life the appearing of Christ in your
[1:07:28] life this this was already in Christ
[1:07:32] Jesus before the foundation of the world
[1:07:36] what is it it's gone unfolding himself
[1:07:43] and when he unfolds himself
[1:07:46] it's very key as I was speaking to the
[1:07:48] older youth Terror at the Youth Camp
[1:07:50] even in their individual life and
[1:07:52] bringing it down to practicalities that
[1:07:55] God himself does and all of a sudden
[1:07:57] just unroll everything but it's slowly
[1:08:00] unfolds itself
[1:08:02] it's God slowly unfolding himself in
[1:08:05] your life
[1:08:08] but now now it's made manifest by the
[1:08:11] appearing notice by the appearing of Our
[1:08:15] Savior Jesus Christ who hath abolished
[1:08:19] death
[1:08:20] and hath brought life and immortality to
[1:08:24] light through the gospel
[1:08:27] now I want to just say it in this way
[1:08:30] when we look at it if I can go go here
[1:08:34] in the Scriptures it referring back to
[1:08:38] in John chapter 1 verse 11 it says he
[1:08:41] came unto his own and his own received
[1:08:44] him not
[1:08:46] now remember he was neither
[1:08:48] Jew nor Gentile in blood
[1:08:52] right but he came through he came
[1:08:55] according to the promise that was given
[1:08:59] clear back there in Genesis 3 15.
[1:09:02] that promise was that behold uh it comes
[1:09:06] more you remember it continues to come
[1:09:07] with greater clarity as it did in Isaiah
[1:09:10] Behold a virgin shall conceive is that
[1:09:12] right and so we're finding this promise
[1:09:15] see here God made a promise now let me
[1:09:18] just say this when God makes a promise I
[1:09:20] know it's very simple and I know that
[1:09:22] these are things that many times we can
[1:09:24] just uh I want to say it in the right
[1:09:26] way can just rehearse these things out
[1:09:27] of our mouth but many times it's to come
[1:09:30] back to the simple parts that when God
[1:09:32] has made a promise God is Not relying on
[1:09:37] any human
[1:09:39] instrumentality to help him out
[1:09:43] that's why the fall happened in the
[1:09:46] beginning that's why Ishmael came along
[1:09:48] On and On anytime human instrumentality
[1:09:52] and you might say well why would human
[1:09:54] instrumentality hey the prophet tells us
[1:09:57] in the message Shalom he tells it in
[1:09:59] perfect Faith he goes to it in greatest
[1:10:01] battle of thought perfect strength
[1:10:03] praying all the way through you'll hear
[1:10:04] of how that sometimes when he says a
[1:10:07] person sees the miraculous or the
[1:10:10] supernatural or they see this take place
[1:10:12] and they reach out and say I can do that
[1:10:14] too what then what is failing to
[1:10:17] recognize is is that yes there is a
[1:10:19] potential but if that's what God has for
[1:10:22] you to do it will not be you doing it
[1:10:25] it'll be you yielding and God doing it
[1:10:28] through you
[1:10:30] that's Grace
[1:10:34] hi
[1:10:36] so he came to his own in his own
[1:10:38] received him not they when he as he
[1:10:41] stood there they didn't want anything to
[1:10:42] do with him the Pharisees and on and on
[1:10:44] they don't want nothing to do with him
[1:10:46] even the way that he came and he came
[1:10:48] according to his word Behold a virgin
[1:10:50] shall conceive and you would look at him
[1:10:52] you would think why would God say it in
[1:10:55] such a way like that well it's very
[1:10:56] simple because why would be the need for
[1:10:59] the Virgin birth it's to undo that
[1:11:02] sexual Affair that was back there at the
[1:11:04] beginning
[1:11:05] because it couldn't it couldn't come
[1:11:07] Redemption could not come through and by
[1:11:10] a sexual blood that was already polluted
[1:11:12] that's why it took God himself creating
[1:11:15] a blood cell
[1:11:17] that was separate from the
[1:11:19] instrumentality of man why because human
[1:11:23] received if it was a blood of any other
[1:11:25] man I don't care how righteous they are
[1:11:26] you would still receive their weaknesses
[1:11:29] but inside of this Blood it was an
[1:11:32] innocent blood Peter called it the blood
[1:11:35] of Christ
[1:11:36] John would rank by inspiration in divine
[1:11:39] revelation that this blood has brought a
[1:11:42] perfect loosening to our lives in other
[1:11:45] words this Blood was so perfect that it
[1:11:48] was able to dismiss the accusations of
[1:11:52] the accuser and through the Holy Spirit
[1:11:55] coming according to that word when
[1:11:58] raised the faith of the people to
[1:12:00] believe I am free
[1:12:05] it's Grace appearing
[1:12:09] but as many as received him that's
[1:12:11] what's important
[1:12:12] as received him to them he gave power
[1:12:17] now that word is the right to become the
[1:12:21] sons of God they they already were but
[1:12:24] now you have a right that's administered
[1:12:27] to you
[1:12:27] it's like things you find out on your
[1:12:29] contract and your job or things you find
[1:12:31] out on your home insurance policy things
[1:12:34] that you didn't know that you had and
[1:12:36] someone makes you aware of the rights
[1:12:37] you've got just because they make you
[1:12:39] aware of the rights you got don't mean
[1:12:41] you have them and when it's made known
[1:12:43] it's a moment to pursue what is
[1:12:46] rightfully yours
[1:12:48] right oh let us not forget the Lord and
[1:12:51] all his benefits
[1:12:52] is that right notice which were born not
[1:12:55] of blood nor of the will of the flesh
[1:12:57] nor of the will of man but of God once
[1:13:00] again it's not the instrumentality of
[1:13:03] man many times we want to see we want to
[1:13:05] see our loved ones we want to see our
[1:13:07] children we want to see other ones we
[1:13:09] want to see we want to see them saved
[1:13:13] but remember it is not our human
[1:13:16] instrumentality that does it but to say
[1:13:19] God lead their heart to the place Lord
[1:13:21] Lord give me the leadership that's
[1:13:24] needed help me Lord to restrain and know
[1:13:27] when to say and when not to say
[1:13:30] you're saying why because if you do it
[1:13:33] or I do it guess what then we're their
[1:13:35] savior
[1:13:36] and then we've got to prop them up we've
[1:13:38] got to keep them up and we that that's
[1:13:40] the problem that's that's where church
[1:13:42] program has gone wrong is they they want
[1:13:45] to to to bring people in by program but
[1:13:48] God already has a program and that
[1:13:51] program is repent be baptized in the
[1:13:54] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[1:13:56] of your sins and you shall receive the
[1:13:59] gift of the Holy Ghost that's God's
[1:14:01] program
[1:14:04] and verse 14 and the word notice this
[1:14:08] was made flesh and dwelt Among Us the
[1:14:12] word
[1:14:13] it didn't just come and go come and go
[1:14:16] but the word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:14:20] Among Us
[1:14:21] the prophets had experienced the
[1:14:23] anointing and then it wouldn't leave off
[1:14:25] of them then it would come back upon
[1:14:27] them then it wouldn't leave off of them
[1:14:29] but here whosoever thou seeth the spirit
[1:14:32] descending and abiding upon the same is
[1:14:38] he
[1:14:40] what is it God was declaring now through
[1:14:43] Redemption Redemption is revealed
[1:14:45] through the spirit descending and
[1:14:48] Abiding and when his Spirit abides it
[1:14:53] cannot do anything different
[1:14:55] than his nature
[1:14:58] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:15:00] among us and we beheld his glory
[1:15:06] full somebody say fool of Grace and
[1:15:10] Truth
[1:15:13] so if there's anything that's full of
[1:15:15] grace and it ain't speaking truth it
[1:15:18] ain't the word
[1:15:20] I don't care why many scriptures they
[1:15:22] can give you
[1:15:24] but if that truth is not calling you to
[1:15:26] a true life of the word it's Error
[1:15:30] I don't care how you feel remember when
[1:15:33] the words made flesh it's full of grace
[1:15:35] and truth
[1:15:37] is that right and truth it is corrective
[1:15:40] truth is there to elevate to bring forth
[1:15:43] that which is really true
[1:15:46] right because all the perversion in all
[1:15:49] of the acts that we see is only a
[1:15:52] perversion of the truth
[1:15:54] so he came to undo the perversion and
[1:15:58] the hold of that that we were held in
[1:16:02] so the word being made flesh this is who
[1:16:05] he was and remember when he came because
[1:16:07] I want you to see to believe the
[1:16:10] manifested word of God brings forth the
[1:16:13] ordained effect of the word of God in
[1:16:14] our lives remember it when they said to
[1:16:17] him uh they're asking him uh um uh in
[1:16:21] John 6 uh that we might what must we do
[1:16:25] that we might work the works of God see
[1:16:27] they're seeing the works of God they saw
[1:16:30] this man who was crippled get up on the
[1:16:33] Sabbath day they have witnessed the
[1:16:35] healing of God they have witnessed the
[1:16:37] miraculous of God listen they knew there
[1:16:40] when nobody else could do this but
[1:16:42] almighty God
[1:16:45] that testimony came Nicodemus came by
[1:16:47] night but like the prophet said at least
[1:16:49] he got there
[1:16:51] is that right at least he got there he
[1:16:53] said we know that thou art a teacher
[1:16:55] come from God
[1:16:58] right and that understanding is what
[1:17:01] condemned that whole group
[1:17:03] because they saw the manifestation as
[1:17:06] Paul calls it the knowledge of the truth
[1:17:09] and they failed to walk in it just like
[1:17:12] the spies that went over in the land
[1:17:14] they saw the land but they failed to
[1:17:17] walk in it
[1:17:18] let me tell you something when you've
[1:17:21] when you've come face to face with the
[1:17:22] grace of God and you turn away from it
[1:17:25] there is no more repentance for sins
[1:17:29] brother Samuel that's pretty strong it
[1:17:31] was pretty strong when the prophet
[1:17:33] preached Abraham's Grace Covenant
[1:17:34] confirmed in Middletown Ohio and the
[1:17:37] prophet said I have witnessed in here he
[1:17:39] said lives that should have responded to
[1:17:42] the word of God he said but they have
[1:17:44] rejected it and turned it away they have
[1:17:47] been face to face with the truth brother
[1:17:49] and sister I don't have that Vision to
[1:17:52] be able to see that but I do know and
[1:17:54] understand this that it's something that
[1:17:56] we cannot just set on the fence and
[1:17:59] watch and wonder you've got to make a
[1:18:02] move one way or the other if it if
[1:18:05] you're for it be for it if you're
[1:18:07] against it be against it
[1:18:09] [Applause]
[1:18:11] you gotta make up your mind
[1:18:13] mama can't do it for you Daddy can't do
[1:18:16] it for you
[1:18:18] oh praise the Lord
[1:18:21] when they came to it notice they came
[1:18:24] standing there and they said Jesus said
[1:18:27] for you to believe he said here's the
[1:18:28] work of God believe on him whom he hath
[1:18:31] sent
[1:18:32] that's the work of God to believe
[1:18:35] do you understand what that means that
[1:18:37] means that you and I are not able in
[1:18:39] ourselves to believe without the work of
[1:18:42] God
[1:18:43] it takes the Holy Spirit moving Upon Our
[1:18:46] Lives to to ignite to believe and to
[1:18:49] recognize that I believe
[1:18:54] and what did they say our fathers ate
[1:18:56] man in the wilderness
[1:18:59] it was excuses
[1:19:01] they ain't man in the wilderness
[1:19:03] and Jesus said and they're everyone dead
[1:19:06] he wasn't talking about in the grave
[1:19:08] he's talking about
[1:19:10] eternally lost
[1:19:12] they send away their day of Grace
[1:19:15] they rejected the grace of God
[1:19:18] so to see that where where it's at they
[1:19:21] are they're they're eternally separate
[1:19:23] because they've rejected the full
[1:19:24] working of the spirit of Grace remember
[1:19:26] the last message we were speaking on
[1:19:28] that they did despite unto the spirit of
[1:19:31] Grace
[1:19:32] it was God's grace wanting to take him
[1:19:34] into the land
[1:19:35] is that right it's God's grace that
[1:19:37] wants to take you into the promises
[1:19:40] that's the grace of God now notice and
[1:19:43] they manifest but you see coming to the
[1:19:45] uh a Promised Land the Manifest his
[1:19:47] victory through them now Zechariah 4 and
[1:19:50] verse 6. it says you remember when he
[1:19:53] saw the seven golden candlesticks that
[1:19:55] were there which are representative of
[1:19:58] God's working through seven Gentile ages
[1:20:01] and Zachariah is is taken by the angel
[1:20:04] of the Lord to look upon this and he's
[1:20:07] asked the question what are these and
[1:20:08] Zechariah being a prophet cannot speak
[1:20:11] unless understanding is given to him
[1:20:14] directly so the angel answers him and
[1:20:17] speaks unto him this is what you are
[1:20:19] seeing in those seven golden
[1:20:20] candlesticks this is the word of the
[1:20:24] Lord unto zerubbabel saying not by might
[1:20:27] nor by power but by my spirit saith the
[1:20:31] Lord of hosts who art thou old great
[1:20:34] Mountain before zerubbabel Thou shalt
[1:20:36] become a plane and he shall bring forth
[1:20:39] The Headstone thereof with shoutings
[1:20:41] crying Grace Grace unto it so who where
[1:20:47] in this and this ministry of zerubbabel
[1:20:50] which is a type even of this last day
[1:20:52] Ministry where where the Church of the
[1:20:55] Living God is built Back Again by the
[1:20:58] power of God and as the word is speaking
[1:21:02] the word that's being spoken to this
[1:21:05] body that's upon Earth is a word that is
[1:21:08] come with shoutings of Grace Grace unto
[1:21:11] it and the grace that is coming is that
[1:21:14] the headstone himself the word is coming
[1:21:17] and is standing here in our midst it is
[1:21:20] the grace of God that has appeared to
[1:21:23] you and I that's what this message is it
[1:21:27] is the shoutings of God's delivering
[1:21:30] Grace Upon Our Lives
[1:21:32] it is the Jubilee that is announced in
[1:21:35] this hour it is God declaring where the
[1:21:38] book has been taken and loose it is
[1:21:40] declaring we have arrived at the end
[1:21:43] this is the end time this is what all of
[1:21:45] them have waited upon they have longed
[1:21:48] for this moment to appear
[1:21:51] and let me just say this just as much as
[1:21:53] the prophets have longed for this moment
[1:21:55] to appear what do you think that
[1:21:58] hungering was inside of your life what
[1:22:01] is the hungering inside of your heart it
[1:22:03] is for Grace to appear and let me ask
[1:22:06] you who put that Grace there God put
[1:22:09] that Grace there it was Grace that put
[1:22:12] it there
[1:22:14] it's Grace that put it there
[1:22:17] you couldn't have done it I couldn't
[1:22:19] have done it on my hook I didn't put it
[1:22:21] there
[1:22:22] Sunday school didn't put it there thank
[1:22:24] God for all of that but it was God that
[1:22:27] put his seed inside of you and me
[1:22:37] if you haven't listened that message of
[1:22:39] Grace in a while I'd encourage you to
[1:22:41] listen to in 1961 in August I I've been
[1:22:44] listening to a lot and I spirit of God
[1:22:46] just Hereafter studying many of these
[1:22:49] things before even before Camp the Lord
[1:22:51] just told me go back and listen to it
[1:22:52] again I said okay and uh I just listened
[1:22:56] to this statement here in the message of
[1:22:57] Grace brother about him here at the end
[1:22:59] of it in prayer he said oh Jesus Messiah
[1:23:03] of God thou art ever near the people are
[1:23:07] aware that you are the Son of God that
[1:23:10] you are here now your great signs and
[1:23:13] wonders are being proved bless them
[1:23:15] Father bless them I pray now let me just
[1:23:19] pause here for a moment
[1:23:20] for the mind that would wonder and say
[1:23:22] how can he say that the Son of God that
[1:23:26] the Messiah that he is now here
[1:23:28] you have to understand
[1:23:31] Jesus did not send
[1:23:33] to the woman at the well
[1:23:35] north of Philip nor to Nathanael he did
[1:23:37] not send them a picture and say look for
[1:23:40] this guy when he steps off the airplane
[1:23:43] right I've had Brothers overseas and
[1:23:45] different ones and so when I'm stepping
[1:23:47] off the plane I kind of let them know
[1:23:48] I've got on a green jacket and I maybe
[1:23:50] wear you know something kind of bright
[1:23:51] I've got a red hat on or something like
[1:23:53] that and I'll just let him know because
[1:23:55] you know one thing it was somebody in a
[1:23:57] picture don't always look the same when
[1:23:58] they come out you know
[1:24:00] that's why I don't ever marry anybody by
[1:24:02] a picture
[1:24:04] you never know what's been photoshopped
[1:24:07] but she God didn't send down a picture
[1:24:09] as far as a picture for somebody to look
[1:24:11] for oh he'll be about this height he'll
[1:24:13] have on a beard he'll wear sandals his
[1:24:15] robe will be about like this and this
[1:24:17] will be that's not how they would
[1:24:18] recognize him remember the Believers
[1:24:21] recognize him as he appears to them in
[1:24:24] the Fulfillment of his word as a matter
[1:24:27] of fact to the believer in the flesh
[1:24:30] itself their mind can look at that flesh
[1:24:33] and say can this be that man can this be
[1:24:36] that person but there's something that
[1:24:38] goes beyond our flesh what is it it is
[1:24:41] God contacting that part on the inside
[1:24:44] that's causing you and I to believe so
[1:24:47] it's not flesh and blood hath not
[1:24:49] revealed this unto you but my Father
[1:24:52] which is in heaven it is a supernatural
[1:24:55] word of the Living God so how did that
[1:24:58] woman at the well know that he was the
[1:25:01] Messiah
[1:25:02] she didn't have a picture of him
[1:25:06] hearing me Church
[1:25:08] but there was promises in the word
[1:25:12] there was promises
[1:25:14] and she knew enough when Messiah cometh
[1:25:18] this is what he will do
[1:25:22] why because his nature never changes I'm
[1:25:25] God and I change the heart she knew
[1:25:28] he'll come according to the word
[1:25:31] and when he began to move according to
[1:25:34] the word and Discerning the thoughts of
[1:25:36] her heart she began to say I perceive
[1:25:39] thou art a prophet he continued to make
[1:25:41] himself known to her what was it Grace
[1:25:44] appearing to her
[1:25:46] when she left that well
[1:25:51] are you hearing me now she left all her
[1:25:55] self-help books there
[1:25:56] [Applause]
[1:25:59] preach brother Samuel I think I will
[1:26:02] she laughed
[1:26:04] very stages to be a better woman
[1:26:08] she had met the god
[1:26:10] who takes a life of a love of woman
[1:26:14] and makes a Proverbs 35 31 godly woman
[1:26:18] out of her what was it she recognized
[1:26:22] the grace appearing to her she didn't
[1:26:25] deserve it
[1:26:28] but Grace came to her
[1:26:30] and that Grace appeared she received it
[1:26:35] and then she becomes a trophy of God's
[1:26:39] grace
[1:26:40] [Music]
[1:26:44] you never catch her doing those things
[1:26:46] again
[1:26:48] you know why she received the grace
[1:26:54] don't wrestle with it receive it
[1:26:59] don't wrestle with it receive it
[1:27:02] is that all right
[1:27:04] notice
[1:27:05] brother but I'm saying watch this oh my
[1:27:07] can I I bless them Father bless them I
[1:27:10] pray
[1:27:11] may they right now believe with all
[1:27:13] their heart that you the Messiah is the
[1:27:16] one standing here
[1:27:18] no one could do that you see what he's
[1:27:20] pointing to
[1:27:21] what's been taking place with healing
[1:27:23] nobody can do that
[1:27:26] hey friends let me say it to you like
[1:27:28] this
[1:27:29] the Bible says the books could not
[1:27:30] contain
[1:27:32] right them the Miracles and the Wonders
[1:27:35] the signs that were done in the ministry
[1:27:38] in his Earthly Ministry
[1:27:40] is that right and the prophet could
[1:27:42] stand there and declare and say he had
[1:27:45] success
[1:27:46] had more success in the humble Ministry
[1:27:50] he gave me than he did in his own
[1:27:54] Earthly Ministry and brother Brahm stops
[1:27:56] and said notice I said he
[1:28:00] he he's had more success oh my
[1:28:05] God my it's just hard to stay focused
[1:28:07] here and not run and preach and my mama
[1:28:10] you understand friends who it is that's
[1:28:13] in our midst
[1:28:14] [Music]
[1:28:16] it's not just a good service who's in
[1:28:19] our midst
[1:28:21] I'm telling you it's Jesus Christ the
[1:28:23] son of God
[1:28:26] it's the Messiah the anointed wire of
[1:28:29] this hour
[1:28:30] [Applause]
[1:28:32] [Music]
[1:28:33] Hallelujah and if you keep trying to
[1:28:35] figure it out you're going to miss it
[1:28:37] it ain't to figure out it's to believe
[1:28:40] and if you don't believe be honest and
[1:28:43] say help thou my unbelief
[1:28:49] no one could do that that's humanly
[1:28:51] impossible Lord Miracle to see the power
[1:28:54] of Messiah come into a little humble
[1:28:57] place like this
[1:28:59] because that you promised it Lord how
[1:29:01] many have you been to Brandon Tabernacle
[1:29:03] before
[1:29:05] I was there just to pre just a a couple
[1:29:08] years ago and I was there and we spent a
[1:29:10] couple hours in there my brother took us
[1:29:12] around and it was just us me and my
[1:29:15] family
[1:29:15] and um
[1:29:17] that isn't anything that I could arrange
[1:29:19] that just God arranged that and uh you
[1:29:21] know and you hear Brother Brown talking
[1:29:23] about how that when they added on and
[1:29:24] everything and the brother was walking
[1:29:26] us through of where where the boundaries
[1:29:27] were
[1:29:28] wow and how small it was before they
[1:29:31] even added on it's already a simple
[1:29:33] little place
[1:29:34] is that right it's already a simple
[1:29:36] little place but to see the boundaries
[1:29:38] of how small that it was even before
[1:29:40] this is when brother Brown's preaching
[1:29:41] this 1961 they hadn't even had it on yet
[1:29:44] but God had already been moving before
[1:29:47] 1961. you see what you say brother
[1:29:49] Samuel he's saying that the Messiah of
[1:29:51] God is there what were the seals for it
[1:29:54] was to uncover The God Who was already
[1:29:57] here all the time
[1:29:59] that's why the prophet could say I
[1:30:01] believe it's in 1957 he said my Ministry
[1:30:03] is to now declare the son of man is here
[1:30:06] now
[1:30:08] that's 1957.
[1:30:11] why he's a focus there is that Inspire
[1:30:14] that inspiration this is what the
[1:30:17] ministry of Malachi 4 is for is to
[1:30:20] declare he is now here and that's a
[1:30:23] Ministry it's in the Bride of Jesus
[1:30:25] Christ to declare that he is now here
[1:30:28] not just here in this building but in
[1:30:31] fact Tabernacle in that Tabernacle in
[1:30:33] that Tabernacle in that Tabernacle
[1:30:35] declaring he's here and if he's here
[1:30:38] while doing everything is possible
[1:30:44] the miracle to see the power of Messiah
[1:30:47] come into a little humble place like
[1:30:49] this because that you promised it Lord
[1:30:51] because your grace oh look at this
[1:30:53] statement this just sent me around for
[1:30:55] Loops because your grace is here to
[1:30:59] Grace us
[1:31:03] how many want to be graced
[1:31:06] how many been graced Lord I want more of
[1:31:08] that Grace
[1:31:11] because your grace is here to Grace us
[1:31:13] because that it's your promise to do it
[1:31:16] you have done it
[1:31:18] we see that you don't leave your people
[1:31:25] he's done it
[1:31:27] he's the one who's promised it he's done
[1:31:29] it and he's the one who does not leave
[1:31:31] his people
[1:31:32] now watch here even when we look the
[1:31:35] manifestation of God's grace as we've
[1:31:37] been looking is that of that of the
[1:31:39] appearing of God's grace is God coming
[1:31:42] to fulfill his promise
[1:31:46] but you know you know how it is when
[1:31:48] when you have every one of us got alarms
[1:31:50] on our phone now probably right I got so
[1:31:52] many things that go off and sometimes I
[1:31:53] wonder is that alarm to remind me of
[1:31:55] another alarmer anybody else like that I
[1:31:57] don't know I mean I got my my fingers
[1:31:59] filled with reminders and markers on my
[1:32:01] calendar but you know what that is when
[1:32:02] that goes off and it comes across
[1:32:04] between you know what that's the new
[1:32:06] reminds you there's an event you're
[1:32:08] supposed to be at
[1:32:10] and let me just say this the grace of
[1:32:12] God Appears to let us know the hour has
[1:32:16] arrived
[1:32:18] Our Moment has arrived oh that's why God
[1:32:22] can make a declaration this is bride
[1:32:25] time this is that time this is the
[1:32:27] Fulfillment of the word of God because
[1:32:30] remember how many men when God made a
[1:32:32] promise that Israel was sojourn in a
[1:32:34] Strange Land for 400 years
[1:32:35] you remember that and God said I'll
[1:32:37] deliver him with a mighty hand is that
[1:32:39] right
[1:32:40] now remember God himself said what would
[1:32:43] take place and they went down there and
[1:32:45] they went down there and they became
[1:32:47] slaves is that right things change you
[1:32:49] know the situation they forgot who
[1:32:51] Joseph was and pharaoh and all those
[1:32:52] things rising up but all that was also
[1:32:55] working in in conjunction with the
[1:32:57] promise of almighty God because God made
[1:32:59] a promise and though 400 years had
[1:33:01] passed and now even when Moses came on
[1:33:04] the scene remember in his own efforts he
[1:33:08] heard about the promise he had been
[1:33:11] taught that promise from when he was
[1:33:13] very young thank God for a Godly mother
[1:33:16] that would rehearse the promises of God
[1:33:18] you know that's only our responsibility
[1:33:20] as parents our responsibility as parents
[1:33:23] is not to save them it's not to fill
[1:33:25] them with the Holy Ghost but it is to
[1:33:27] rehearse the promises of God keep him in
[1:33:29] an atmosphere in our home and in other
[1:33:32] meetings and right here within the
[1:33:33] assembly keep them in as much under the
[1:33:36] influence of almighty God until they
[1:33:38] come to a place like Isaiah did said woe
[1:33:41] is me for I'm a man of unclean lips and
[1:33:44] I dwell among unclean people if there's
[1:33:46] anything that ever brings our young
[1:33:49] person or anybody else to the
[1:33:51] recognition that they are a sinner yet
[1:33:53] takes the presence of almighty God
[1:33:57] is that right now notice this it would
[1:33:59] take God's presence coming to fulfill
[1:34:01] that word and hear Moses 40 years later
[1:34:04] 440 years now here he is he goes to try
[1:34:08] to you know to to to to to bring him out
[1:34:11] but all he does is kill one Egyptian
[1:34:16] nothing
[1:34:18] and yet you can ask Moses Moses what are
[1:34:20] you trying to do well I'm trying to
[1:34:22] fulfill the promise but the problem was
[1:34:25] his human instrumentality
[1:34:29] now what he needed was is a fresh
[1:34:33] visitation to the throne of God
[1:34:36] he needed his vision renewed
[1:34:40] he needed to meet God personally and
[1:34:44] that God would confirm it because in the
[1:34:46] presence of God Moses offered God all
[1:34:50] kinds of excuses of why he was an unfit
[1:34:54] subject why because in the presence of
[1:34:57] God the very thing that he tried to use
[1:35:00] to free Israel it became nothing but a
[1:35:04] failure in the presence of God his human
[1:35:07] weaknesses stood out and that's what he
[1:35:10] tried to offer God but God didn't want
[1:35:12] his human weaknesses to operate the
[1:35:15] promise God said I am come down to
[1:35:19] deliver my people
[1:35:22] is that right so then we find Moses
[1:35:25] going back into Egypt there and when
[1:35:28] Moses goes back in remember that in
[1:35:30] itself it was God's grace to his people
[1:35:32] let me read Hosea 12 13 and by a prophet
[1:35:36] the Lord brought Israel out of Egypt and
[1:35:39] by Prophet was he preserved
[1:35:42] Exodus 13 3 I love that Moses said unto
[1:35:45] the people remember this day in which
[1:35:48] you came out from Egypt out of the house
[1:35:51] of bondage for by strength of hand the
[1:35:54] Lord brought you out from this place
[1:35:58] now the scripture just said over in
[1:36:00] Hosea by a prophet but what was it it
[1:36:03] was the word of God in fulfillment God's
[1:36:07] grace had appeared to them
[1:36:10] and they receiving that Grace they
[1:36:13] received the strength that comes with
[1:36:15] that to walk out of Egypt God dismantled
[1:36:18] every oh my every demon power that
[1:36:21] wanted to raise up every complex every
[1:36:24] anxiety every fear everything that
[1:36:26] wanted to rise up and try to speak
[1:36:28] against us you're not worthy of this you
[1:36:31] can't go you've been in bondage to this
[1:36:33] you've done this over and over and over
[1:36:35] but the grace of God appeared to them
[1:36:38] and Grace overruled it moved beyond all
[1:36:41] their failures their shortcomings their
[1:36:43] human instrumentality and they believe
[1:36:46] the manifestation of God's grace and
[1:36:49] what did it do it broke every hole that
[1:36:51] was upon their lives
[1:36:53] [Applause]
[1:36:59] Hallelujah
[1:37:01] so every time that a message has come
[1:37:04] that message has always come with grace
[1:37:06] mercy and deliverance
[1:37:10] right we're already in trouble we need
[1:37:13] help
[1:37:15] you got a flat tire you don't need
[1:37:16] somebody to come along the roadside and
[1:37:18] say you got a flat tire duh I know that
[1:37:21] you need a message of grace and mercy
[1:37:25] and deliverance
[1:37:27] let me just say it to you like this so
[1:37:29] you understand it I speak that statement
[1:37:31] as he gives it to me that this word is
[1:37:34] not a word that has come to condemn you
[1:37:37] or put you down
[1:37:39] but it's a word that has come with grace
[1:37:43] to be able to separate you from the real
[1:37:46] you on the inside
[1:37:47] [Applause]
[1:37:49] are you hearing me it takes God's grace
[1:37:52] to make you and I aware of the condition
[1:37:55] that we're in in this hour
[1:37:58] is that right it took God's grace
[1:38:00] appearing to make you and I aware of the
[1:38:03] condition that we were in and God's
[1:38:06] light listen now God's light shining so
[1:38:09] bright it shows the contrast of where
[1:38:12] you and I were at as the word of God is
[1:38:15] being preached it shows the contrast
[1:38:18] even though in a life that can seem to
[1:38:21] be so wholesome and good but when God's
[1:38:24] grace is appearing it shows that there
[1:38:26] is a true Grace a true goodness that
[1:38:30] comes alone from almighty God
[1:38:39] ma can you imagine otherwise standing
[1:38:41] there on that day you would say Lord you
[1:38:43] know you really didn't need to come
[1:38:46] you really didn't need to change you
[1:38:47] shed your blood
[1:38:49] you know it's kind of a waste of time
[1:38:50] for me because I was already good
[1:38:52] I I was able to live a really good life
[1:38:56] well by the Samuel he came to shed his
[1:38:58] blood from him well then why did he why
[1:38:59] did you need his blood to be shed for
[1:39:00] you
[1:39:03] come on now
[1:39:04] let's dive a little deeper can we a few
[1:39:06] more moments here notice this Isaiah and
[1:39:09] not Nehemiah chapter 9 verse 27 I know
[1:39:11] something to me feel like it's dangerous
[1:39:12] but let me just let me just dive here
[1:39:14] just a few moments here notice in
[1:39:16] Nehemiah chapter 9 verse 27 Nehemiah
[1:39:19] picks this up and he's talking about how
[1:39:21] Israel would get back into situations in
[1:39:24] their lives and he says therefore thou
[1:39:27] delivers them into the hand of their
[1:39:28] enemies who vexed them why did God
[1:39:30] deliver his people into the hands of
[1:39:31] their enemies because they disobeyed him
[1:39:34] right they walked contrary to his voice
[1:39:37] it wasn't God being a mean
[1:39:40] I'm gonna get you no God God a matter of
[1:39:43] fact pleaded with them
[1:39:45] don't go this way
[1:39:48] but they went anyhow
[1:39:50] they went anyhow they ignored it and
[1:39:53] overrode it and over you know eventually
[1:39:55] once you override something long enough
[1:39:57] it becomes faint
[1:40:01] one excuse after another excuse after
[1:40:04] another excuse after another excuse
[1:40:06] after another excuses it diminishes the
[1:40:10] intensity
[1:40:11] of the first moment of conviction
[1:40:15] let me just say this this is why the
[1:40:17] scripture says today is the day of
[1:40:20] salvation
[1:40:21] this is the moment for whatever is
[1:40:24] needed in your life this is the moment
[1:40:26] that God is inspiring his word to your
[1:40:29] heart it's the time to act
[1:40:33] are you hearing me
[1:40:34] let me come down here
[1:40:36] and in the time of their trouble when
[1:40:38] they Cried unto thee thou hurtest them
[1:40:40] from heaven and according to thy
[1:40:42] manifold mercies thou gave us them
[1:40:45] saviors
[1:40:47] who saved them out of the hand of their
[1:40:51] enemies now who were some of these
[1:40:53] saviors well the prophets down through
[1:40:55] the time then you had also the judges
[1:40:57] Samuel Samson Gideon right they became
[1:41:02] savior well how did they become saviors
[1:41:05] how how did that how did that happen
[1:41:07] it's because God called them his grace
[1:41:11] appeared to them I don't have time to go
[1:41:13] through every one of those examples but
[1:41:15] God's grace appeared to them like he did
[1:41:16] to get in and he gets he brings Gideon
[1:41:19] to where Gideon himself comes to
[1:41:21] separate himself from all that he's ever
[1:41:23] known about himself from every fear and
[1:41:25] complex that's been over his life
[1:41:27] because my family is the smallest family
[1:41:28] and on and on and on he brings him to a
[1:41:30] place to where everything is broken from
[1:41:33] around his life to where Gideon can
[1:41:35] fully believe God and when Gideon begins
[1:41:38] to move in the grace that has appeared
[1:41:40] to him then Grace begins to sound out of
[1:41:43] his life and you find that that is a
[1:41:45] courage that moves into Israel to get
[1:41:48] behind and move in the grace of almighty
[1:41:50] God and what does God do God moves to
[1:41:53] cause the midianites to flee from the
[1:41:56] country is that right it was the same
[1:41:58] thing with Samson it's the same thing
[1:42:00] with with Elijah even when Elijah did
[1:42:02] that on Mount Carmel that was God's
[1:42:04] grace coming down upon Mount Carmel and
[1:42:08] what did it do the prophet told us there
[1:42:10] were seven thousand when Elijah thought
[1:42:12] at that moment I'm the only guy you ever
[1:42:14] felt all alone
[1:42:16] yeah sure we all have Elijah even in
[1:42:19] that moment of fulfilling the word of
[1:42:21] God he felt all alone because afterwards
[1:42:25] when the mind of Christ had lifted off
[1:42:27] of him he fled and he went in the cave
[1:42:29] and remember he told God I am I the only
[1:42:33] one who is left but God let him know hey
[1:42:36] I've got seven thousand reserved to me
[1:42:39] that have not bowed a knee unto Baal
[1:42:42] well Lord I didn't see them I know you
[1:42:44] don't but that's why I needed you to
[1:42:46] stand there and allow my grace to appear
[1:42:49] because the appearing of my grace upon
[1:42:53] the altar was apart from all the
[1:42:56] teachings of Baal from everything they
[1:42:58] were doing it was me confirming my word
[1:43:01] my grace and it has given courage to the
[1:43:05] seven thousand to rise up out of their
[1:43:08] foxholes and dims and caves it has given
[1:43:12] them courage to stand for me
[1:43:15] that's what the grace of God has done in
[1:43:18] this hour
[1:43:19] right what sent T.L Osborne to brother
[1:43:21] branham's address and asked him and said
[1:43:23] brother random he said what do I have to
[1:43:26] do he said in order he said when I'm
[1:43:28] praying he said in this to take place he
[1:43:31] said in this way he said you think God's
[1:43:33] called me he said to a Ministry a
[1:43:35] praying and brother bran said well
[1:43:36] brother he said if you're called to
[1:43:37] preach the gospel you're called to pray
[1:43:39] for the sick
[1:43:40] and remember brother did the T Osborne
[1:43:42] show I'm just going to go home and nail
[1:43:43] myself up in a closet you know now
[1:43:45] remember brother T Osborne had never
[1:43:47] seen these types of things before
[1:43:48] remember I don't know if you've ever
[1:43:49] seen it on YouTube where T.L Osborne
[1:43:51] gets up and he said we as Pentecostals
[1:43:52] were used to The Stomping and the and
[1:43:54] the everything he said and brother Brown
[1:43:56] stood right there and just said come out
[1:43:57] of him
[1:43:59] he said we were waiting somebody's got
[1:44:01] to be shook
[1:44:02] something's got to happen
[1:44:04] right but he said no what you say what
[1:44:07] was that it was the grace of God that
[1:44:09] appeared
[1:44:11] listen to me
[1:44:13] when you are set free it is not God
[1:44:17] overpowering it is God speaking to you
[1:44:21] to let you know your rights and that's
[1:44:23] why I say to you right here this morning
[1:44:25] when you can receive the grace of God
[1:44:28] appearing to you for your need you can
[1:44:30] say sickness you're under my feet habits
[1:44:34] you're under my feet be setting sin
[1:44:36] you're under my feet I need the Holy
[1:44:39] Ghost so discouragement and complex
[1:44:41] you're under my feet what was that it's
[1:44:45] God's grace
[1:44:46] [Applause]
[1:44:47] that comes to you and I to cause us to
[1:44:50] believe
[1:44:52] [Applause]
[1:44:54] he sent saviors to save him out of the
[1:44:58] hand of their enemies now let me ask you
[1:45:00] a question
[1:45:01] if this this this said he was a savior
[1:45:05] what if when he came to Gideon
[1:45:07] they're still in the hand of the
[1:45:08] midianites
[1:45:10] what if Gideon walked up to him and said
[1:45:12] I'll tell you what y'all boys need to do
[1:45:15] y'all just need to act like you're not
[1:45:17] in bondage
[1:45:21] you need to be nice to these midianites
[1:45:25] you know what you'd say what you should
[1:45:28] say that ain't a savior
[1:45:30] because a savior is a deliverer
[1:45:36] you know what that's what you'd say
[1:45:37] you'd say that's a man that's trying to
[1:45:39] pump me up prep me up and everything
[1:45:41] else that ain't what God comes to do he
[1:45:43] comes to bring you from the whole
[1:45:48] of your enemies
[1:45:51] one of these days
[1:45:54] remember receiving the end of our
[1:45:56] Salvation one of these days
[1:45:59] oh wretched man than I am who shall
[1:46:02] deliver me
[1:46:05] The Wretched Man that I look at every
[1:46:07] day in the mirror The Wretched Man that
[1:46:09] I look at but who shall deliver me God's
[1:46:12] Saving Grace sweeping over and there'll
[1:46:14] be a change come over us
[1:46:18] oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:46:21] notice the scripture says
[1:46:24] and he shall bring forth a son
[1:46:27] and thou shalt call his name Matthew 1
[1:46:30] 21. Jesus
[1:46:32] for he shall save
[1:46:34] his people
[1:46:36] from there
[1:46:38] sins
[1:46:40] [Music]
[1:46:43] now he's done this is careful he didn't
[1:46:46] say he would save him in their sins
[1:46:49] save them from their sins
[1:46:53] for he shall save
[1:46:56] his
[1:46:57] people
[1:46:59] already were his people
[1:47:02] before the foundation of the world
[1:47:05] just like when God went down he never
[1:47:07] came down and said I wonder what nation
[1:47:09] there's got some people in it that want
[1:47:10] to go free no is Egypt had Israel in
[1:47:13] bondage and God said I got a promise in
[1:47:16] my word and I'm coming to fulfill that
[1:47:19] promise
[1:47:21] and when Grace appeared
[1:47:24] it led them forth from their task
[1:47:27] Masters
[1:47:33] Satan got to sitting around a little bit
[1:47:36] Pharaoh did and said
[1:47:39] man who in the world's going to do all
[1:47:40] this work now
[1:47:44] good Lord
[1:47:45] we know the Egyptian sure ain't gonna do
[1:47:47] it
[1:47:48] they're just sitting at home and waiting
[1:47:49] on something to come I wonder what's
[1:47:51] going to happen here
[1:47:54] if they were looking around
[1:47:57] finally you know what it is
[1:47:59] God said I'm going to get me Glory upon
[1:48:01] him
[1:48:02] the taskmasters they were still alive
[1:48:07] and that spirit of fear said I'm gonna
[1:48:08] get him
[1:48:10] that Spirit anxiety said I'm going to
[1:48:11] get them that Spirit Allah said I'm
[1:48:13] going to get them
[1:48:14] come on now he said I'm going to take
[1:48:17] after him what was it but you see God
[1:48:19] was alluring Satan because he had
[1:48:23] overtaken them and had them in bondage
[1:48:25] before but God was alluring them to a
[1:48:28] place where he was going to execute
[1:48:30] judgment
[1:48:32] thank you
[1:48:36] brother and sister let me tell you if
[1:48:39] you hear the hounds of Hell behind you
[1:48:41] don't turn around and look at them stand
[1:48:43] still and see the salvation of our God
[1:48:49] the devil tells you I'm gonna take you
[1:48:51] back over he's a liar
[1:48:54] you stand your ground
[1:48:56] [Music]
[1:48:57] but there's something in my way he's a
[1:48:59] Waymaker
[1:49:01] the same Grace that appeared to raise up
[1:49:04] a prophet against his own will the same
[1:49:07] Grace that provided a pillar of fire the
[1:49:10] same Grace that has come down and called
[1:49:12] you out that same Grace will take you
[1:49:16] all the way
[1:49:22] stand still and see the salvation of our
[1:49:26] God
[1:49:29] Hallelujah let's stand
[1:49:34] I want to keep preaching you know that
[1:49:42] sometimes I wish we had a night service
[1:49:43] don't get nervous
[1:49:45] but I know I know God knows what we need
[1:49:47] and that's what I ask him for
[1:49:50] but let me just
[1:49:53] as they stood there to Red Sea
[1:50:00] I want you to notice this
[1:50:02] I want you to listen carefully because
[1:50:03] this speaks to you and I
[1:50:05] Moses stood there
[1:50:07] and he told the people
[1:50:09] fear not
[1:50:11] for the Egyptians you see today
[1:50:15] you'll see him no more
[1:50:19] when Moses turned to speak to God
[1:50:22] or Moses why cry unto me
[1:50:26] you speak that the people go forward
[1:50:29] and when brother Brown preaches that
[1:50:31] message in 63 in July very very very key
[1:50:34] place
[1:50:35] he says see it shows
[1:50:38] the humanness and the human
[1:50:40] instrumentality one moment prophesying
[1:50:45] you see prophecy was not Moses working
[1:50:47] up like glory to God this is known
[1:50:50] it spoke out of him
[1:50:53] spoke out of him
[1:50:55] fear not the Egyptians that you see you
[1:50:59] shall see no more
[1:51:01] but when he turns around God recognizes
[1:51:03] why are you crying unto me he could pick
[1:51:07] that up within Moses and what was God
[1:51:09] reminding him God reminded him of his
[1:51:12] Commission
[1:51:14] let me tell you something there might be
[1:51:16] things traps and other things that have
[1:51:18] tried to come along the way but I want
[1:51:20] to remind you you have been commissioned
[1:51:24] and remember that the God who called you
[1:51:28] The God Who Sanctified you the God who
[1:51:32] has failed you listen even you might be
[1:51:34] back here under justification but
[1:51:35] remember The God Who justifies you the
[1:51:39] God who calls your heart to turn to him
[1:51:41] is the same God that will take you on
[1:51:43] every step of the way
[1:51:45] what do I do stand still and see the
[1:51:47] salvation of our God that don't mean
[1:51:49] keep moving it means Look to Him and
[1:51:52] trust in him who will not leave you he
[1:51:54] had brought you this far he'll take you
[1:51:57] safely home he's The God Who made the
[1:51:59] promise he's The God Who fulfills his
[1:52:01] promise
[1:52:02] [Applause]
[1:52:07] Moses he held up that Rod you know what
[1:52:09] that Rod represented the deity of Jesus
[1:52:12] Christ
[1:52:12] praise God praise God it represented the
[1:52:15] name of Jesus Christ given to the Church
[1:52:17] of the Living God
[1:52:19] let me tell you there's not a situation
[1:52:21] or a problem
[1:52:22] That's too great for the name of Jesus
[1:52:25] Christ
[1:52:27] you got to be setting sin in your life
[1:52:29] hold the name of Jesus Christ over it
[1:52:33] Hallelujah you got a problem in your
[1:52:35] life if fear wanting to come back a
[1:52:37] complex maybe that's built around your
[1:52:38] life then nobody loves me and I think
[1:52:40] so-and-so is half mirror or brother
[1:52:42] Samuel is always preaching on me I see
[1:52:43] it when he looks at me take the name of
[1:52:45] Jesus Christ and hold it over that thing
[1:52:47] and say you ain't going to take my
[1:52:49] Liberty you ain't gonna take my joy
[1:52:51] you ain't gonna stand here and try to
[1:52:53] bring torment to me because torment
[1:52:54] ain't in the house of God it's a lying
[1:52:57] spirit
[1:52:59] there's joy in the house of the Lord
[1:53:01] there's freedom in the house of God
[1:53:03] there's liberty if there ever was a
[1:53:06] place to receive Liberty it's in the
[1:53:08] house of God that when you walk out of
[1:53:10] here this house of God walks out with
[1:53:13] Liberty
[1:53:19] and he held that name right there but
[1:53:21] Joshua he didn't take it down
[1:53:23] he held it amen
[1:53:29] and in East Wind you know an East Wind
[1:53:31] was it's a resurrection wind
[1:53:38] the same wind that blew in on the day of
[1:53:40] Pentecost
[1:53:47] he started partner
[1:53:48] now I I I don't know if it happened just
[1:53:50] like it did on Ten Commandments as far
[1:53:52] as all at one I don't know that
[1:53:55] but what I do know is what the Bible
[1:53:57] tells us
[1:53:58] is that they walked on dry ground
[1:54:04] but Simon what are you saying I'm
[1:54:05] telling you that every place that God
[1:54:06] opens for you
[1:54:09] you rebuke that line spirit that says
[1:54:11] you're going to sink
[1:54:12] you're walking on Solid Ground
[1:54:18] the grace of God reveals that well I'm
[1:54:21] afraid I might not be able to do it I'm
[1:54:23] afraid if I'm baptized I may not be able
[1:54:24] to live right I'm afraid if if I confess
[1:54:27] that the Holy Ghost is mine that the
[1:54:29] enemy is just going to gonna just take
[1:54:30] right after me
[1:54:32] God has given you Solid Ground
[1:54:35] amen to walk on and say it's mine
[1:54:41] it's mine
[1:54:43] Liberty is mine
[1:54:45] Freedom From Fear is mine
[1:54:49] I don't have to live in anxiety
[1:54:53] I can live in Freedom
[1:54:56] I don't have to live under a tormenting
[1:54:59] spirit amen are you hearing me now
[1:55:03] listen to him now
[1:55:04] you don't have to live that way but you
[1:55:07] can put your foot on dry ground
[1:55:11] as he's opening the way
[1:55:13] walk in it
[1:55:15] that's Grace
[1:55:16] that's Grace and let me just tell you
[1:55:18] throw down every thought that wants to
[1:55:20] rise and remind you
[1:55:23] of all of your failures your previous
[1:55:25] fears trepidations throw it down it's
[1:55:30] Satan's tactic
[1:55:33] to try to hinder you from receiving
[1:55:36] God's grace I'll tell you right here
[1:55:39] this morning there's Grace
[1:55:43] there's Grace
[1:55:44] for healing
[1:55:46] there's Grace for deliverance

[1:55:57] that's him
[1:55:58] amen that's him
[1:56:00] you haven't worked yourself up it's him
[1:56:03] it's responding to his presence
[1:56:06] amen that's the same way that man was in
[1:56:08] the pool when it was stirred step in it
[1:56:10] that's God's grace when the man could
[1:56:13] not get there to that pool
[1:56:16] he said I have tried
[1:56:19] how many years
[1:56:21] I've tried
[1:56:22] I've tried
[1:56:26] I wonder if he just had finally given up
[1:56:29] hope
[1:56:30] he looked at his condition
[1:56:32] he looked at it
[1:56:34] how am I going to ever get there before
[1:56:36] anybody else my condition
[1:56:39] but Grace
[1:56:44] appeared
[1:56:46] and asked him will thou be made home
