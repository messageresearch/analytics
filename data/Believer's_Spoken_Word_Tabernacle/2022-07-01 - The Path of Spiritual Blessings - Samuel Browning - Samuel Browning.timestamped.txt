[38:21] deuteronomy chapter 28 i will say it's
[38:23] just
[38:24] it's good to be in the house of the lord
[38:26] and
[38:27] amended now
[38:28] i just know i
[38:30] heard
[38:31] even the reports
[38:33] the service here on sunday and just a
[38:35] wonderful
[38:36] it meant a wonderful service and we
[38:38] certainly thank you for
[38:40] your prayers there
[38:42] as we were
[38:43] with brother ray erickson and the
[38:45] assembly there and just ask that you'll
[38:46] continue to keep them in prayer many of
[38:49] you
[38:50] were aware of the couple that was
[38:53] that had passed on in that house
[38:56] explosion and then on sunday evening
[38:59] there was
[39:00] also a family that was involved in a
[39:03] head-on collision
[39:04] and
[39:05] the the brother the young man went on
[39:08] home
[39:09] he passed away so
[39:12] and just to keep the families in prayer
[39:14] and the church because they're certainly
[39:16] certainly been dealing with a lot and i
[39:18] can i can say this that um
[39:21] even as we were there on on sunday you
[39:23] you know that there is
[39:25] the strength of the lord that is really
[39:28] there with them and
[39:31] just to see god's comfort and
[39:34] just just how how that the lord just has
[39:38] been helping them along and we we have
[39:41] that you know no no i'm glad that that
[39:43] that god not only
[39:45] ministers to give us uh real comfort in
[39:48] our soul but then even at times when our
[39:50] spirit needs healing he's there to heal
[39:53] our spirit
[39:54] just as much as to heal our body and so
[39:57] we're thankful for that and we just want
[39:59] to continue to remember them in prayer
[40:00] and
[40:01] also
[40:02] i know i heard the testimony that was
[40:04] given
[40:06] for for sister linda and
[40:09] that she's back home now and she was
[40:11] really
[40:12] well of course you can imagine after
[40:14] five months in the hospital uh someone
[40:17] she's very very thankful
[40:19] and uh she just
[40:21] to me it's just a miracle all the way
[40:23] through i don't
[40:24] i you know i've spoke to some and i
[40:27] don't i don't want to take a lot of time
[40:29] here tonight
[40:30] um but i just it's just a miracle just
[40:32] from just the moments of seeing her at
[40:34] first and then
[40:36] to where everything has come to and we
[40:38] just give god all the praise on our
[40:40] glory
[40:41] and um
[40:42] let's just look here in the word in
[40:44] deuteronomy chapter 28 and i'm not going
[40:47] to have you stand for the whole part
[40:49] i'll just we'll just read a couple
[40:50] scriptures and then we'll let you be
[40:52] seated here tonight
[40:55] in in deuteronomy chapter 28 and verse 1
[40:58] and it shall come to pass
[41:00] if thou shalt hearken diligently
[41:03] unto the voice of the lord thy god
[41:06] to observe and to do all his
[41:09] commandments
[41:11] which i command thee this day
[41:13] that the lord thy god will set thee on
[41:17] high
[41:18] above all nations of the earth
[41:21] and all these blessings shall come on
[41:24] thee
[41:25] and overtake thee if thou shalt hearken
[41:28] unto the voice of the lord thy god
[41:32] amen may god bless you and bless the
[41:34] reading of the word as you're being
[41:35] seated
[41:41] if you notice as we read here in verse 1
[41:44] and verse 2 i'd like to speak tonight
[41:47] subject i've been trying to get to uh
[41:50] and then tonight hopefully it just leads
[41:52] a conjunction in between
[41:54] but um
[41:55] the path i want to just speak on tonight
[41:58] the path
[41:59] of spiritual blessings
[42:01] the path of spiritual blessings
[42:04] and when we
[42:05] look here in verse 1 and in verse 2
[42:09] if you notice that when god pronounces
[42:12] this of of the blessings that the
[42:15] blessing of the lord if you look here in
[42:18] verse 2 it says all these blessings
[42:21] shall come on thee and overtake thee if
[42:24] thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the
[42:28] lord thy god so the blessing of the lord
[42:32] it travels through the word of the lord
[42:35] the blessing of the lord doesn't will
[42:37] not come in any other way but through
[42:40] his word
[42:41] and to see that within just verse one
[42:44] and verse two it's
[42:46] hearts that and lives that are
[42:48] hearkening not just
[42:50] it first starts with agreeing with the
[42:52] word
[42:53] but it's more than just agreeing with it
[42:56] it's the le it's to give our lives to
[42:59] that word and let that word change our
[43:02] lives
[43:03] so the so the blessing of the lord as it
[43:05] comes through the word and in verse 3 i
[43:08] want to go on and read it says blessed
[43:10] shalt thou be in the city blessed shalt
[43:13] thou be in the filled blessed shalt thou
[43:15] be the fruit of thy body and the fruit
[43:18] of thy ground and the fruit of thy
[43:21] cattle the increase of thy kind and the
[43:24] flocks of thy sheep blessed shall be thy
[43:28] basket and thy store
[43:30] blessed shalt thou be when thou comest
[43:33] in and blessed shalt thou be when thou
[43:35] goest out
[43:36] and the lord shall cause thine enemies
[43:39] that rise up against thee to be smitten
[43:43] before thy face
[43:45] they shall come out against thee one way
[43:48] and they shall flee before thee
[43:51] seven ways
[43:53] so there's going to be opposition in the
[43:55] midst of all the blessings there is
[43:58] going to be oppositions
[44:00] because this land of promise that we are
[44:02] speaking of we know we're reading here
[44:05] god gave that land of canaan as a type
[44:10] in the natural of what the real promised
[44:12] land is to the believer is the holy
[44:16] ghost
[44:17] and god has as let it be known there is
[44:20] going to be opposition in other words
[44:23] satan is going to challenge every
[44:27] single blessing and everything that god
[44:30] has for you and i there's going to be
[44:33] opposition before us but we have this
[44:36] promise here the lord shall cause thine
[44:39] enemies
[44:40] not not our our great ability our great
[44:43] military strategy but god shall cause
[44:46] thine enemies that rise up to be smitten
[44:49] before thee and notice they will flee
[44:52] before thee seven ways it'll be a
[44:55] complete victory not partial anything
[44:57] that god does is not a partial doing
[45:00] when god when god moves on the scene to
[45:02] fight the battle
[45:04] god brings a complete deliverance a
[45:07] complete victory
[45:09] so no matter you you might be looking at
[45:12] something even tonight but remember this
[45:14] is part of the blessing that even when
[45:17] as you might see one pathway going and
[45:19] one pathway going there is a complete
[45:23] victory that god has and for every
[45:27] situation that arises we might see
[45:29] little by little sometimes things just
[45:31] doesn't go right away but we have the
[45:34] promise that god has given us he said i
[45:36] will dismantle every enemy that rises up
[45:40] against you
[45:43] verse 8 the lord shall command the
[45:45] blessing upon thee in thy storehouses
[45:49] and in all that thou settest thine hand
[45:52] unto
[45:53] he shall bless thee in the land which
[45:55] the lord thy god giveth thee
[45:58] the lord shall establish thee and holy
[46:01] people unto himself as he hath sworn
[46:04] unto thee
[46:05] if thou shalt keep the commandments of
[46:08] the lord thy god
[46:09] and walk in his ways let me just let me
[46:12] just stop here just for a moment
[46:14] god's desire was that israel
[46:18] would have a heart it would be in their
[46:21] heart to do
[46:23] the will of god
[46:25] and notice the law itself the law being
[46:28] given thou shalt do this
[46:30] thou shalt not do this thou shalt not do
[46:32] this that was not god's
[46:35] perfection or what god desired is that
[46:39] man would just live by the law but god's
[46:41] desire knowing that when man fell in the
[46:44] beginning it was inwardly there had to
[46:47] come about a change on the inside to
[46:51] where it's more than us just not doing
[46:53] this because i shouldn't do that but it
[46:56] god's desire was i want to make it i
[46:59] want to bring it to where now there's a
[47:01] change on the inside to where the very
[47:04] desire of the heart of the individual is
[47:08] changed so that the keeping of the word
[47:13] is not you and i trying to keep it and
[47:17] listen that's all part of a of a stage
[47:19] of the journey are you hearing me
[47:21] god begins to deal with the life that's
[47:24] all part of the stage of the journey
[47:27] justification sanctification baptism of
[47:30] the holy ghost but in this where his
[47:33] where his life comes down on the inside
[47:36] it brings it brings a complete
[47:39] transformation in that life and the path
[47:43] of spiritual blessings is heeding the
[47:46] word of god he's yielding to it it's not
[47:48] us trying to figure it out that's many
[47:51] times where we fail we try to figure it
[47:53] out listen let's just be honest now it's
[47:56] this thing that has got us in trouble
[47:59] the fall itself happened by reasoning
[48:02] with the word of god god made a promise
[48:05] and all he asked them to do was believe
[48:07] it
[48:08] and believe it is is to look to god to
[48:11] fulfill it in his season
[48:13] not for us to make it come to pass but
[48:16] notice where in the beginning the
[48:18] failure came when they begin to reason
[48:21] with the promise of almighty god reason
[48:24] with the word and all god asks you and i
[48:26] to do is yield to his voice be diligent
[48:30] to observe what it is that he's speaking
[48:34] every promise to the ages is he that
[48:37] hath an ear
[48:39] everybody has ears
[48:41] is that right
[48:43] but when it says he that hath an ear
[48:45] it's speaking more than these ears right
[48:46] here but it's speaking to that on the
[48:49] inside of that heaven hath in here let
[48:52] him hear what the spirit saith to the
[48:55] churches
[48:56] that it's not it's not man but it's the
[49:00] holy spirit that's speaking to where a
[49:02] life begins to awaken to the voice of
[49:04] god
[49:07] notice this in verse 10 and all the
[49:09] people of the earth shall see that thou
[49:12] art called by the name of the lord and
[49:15] they shall be afraid of thee
[49:18] and the lord shall make thee plenteous
[49:21] in goods in the fruit of thy body in the
[49:24] fruit of thy cattle in the fruit of thy
[49:26] ground in the land which the lord swear
[49:29] unto thy fathers to give thee
[49:32] let me just say it like this
[49:35] this all of these promises that god has
[49:38] given
[49:39] is not the reason why a life serves god
[49:45] are you hearing me
[49:47] it's like when you go to sign up for a
[49:49] job there's such a thing called french
[49:51] benefits
[49:53] is that right
[49:55] you know as a teacher i couldn't ask
[49:56] much when i went for the interview but
[49:58] when i went for the interview of an
[49:59] administrator that's different
[50:02] you start asking them here do i have
[50:04] pick up on the pickup in other words i'm
[50:06] not paying for my retirement but there
[50:08] you are kicking in the part that i
[50:09] normally would kick in
[50:12] are you hearing me there's benefits
[50:14] french fringe benefits
[50:17] things that come with it and it's just
[50:19] part of the package and that's what god
[50:21] is saying many of these things we've
[50:23] read about right here are natural
[50:25] blessings and god has said i'm your
[50:28] caregiver i'm your caretaker i'm jehovah
[50:31] jireh if you'll just hearken to my voice
[50:34] i'll see that the things in the natural
[50:37] or their blessings will be poured out so
[50:39] that your focus is not on the natural
[50:42] things of life
[50:45] when israel got away from the voice of
[50:48] god that's when they had to start
[50:49] focusing on the natural things of life
[50:52] this is where they started to worship
[50:54] other gods
[50:56] trying to find on their books trying to
[50:58] find other things and find other ways
[51:00] but god has one program
[51:02] it's a simple program
[51:05] all that god asks us to do is believe
[51:08] and yield to his voice and give
[51:10] ourselves to him
[51:13] and he'll take care of everything else
[51:18] and the lord shall open unto thee his
[51:22] good treasure the heaven to give the
[51:24] rain unto thy land in the in his season
[51:27] and to bless all the work of the hand
[51:29] and thou shalt lend unto many nations
[51:31] and thou shalt not borrow and the lord
[51:34] shall make thee the head and not the
[51:37] tale i'm not going to be able to get
[51:38] here tonight and thou shalt be above
[51:40] only and thou shalt not be beneath that
[51:44] if thou sh now hearken unto the
[51:46] commandments of the lord thy god which i
[51:49] command thee this day to observe and to
[51:52] do them thou shalt not go aside from any
[51:56] of the words which i command thee this
[51:58] day to the right hand or to the left to
[52:02] go after other gods to serve them
[52:06] what an application
[52:09] that remember
[52:11] that even the dying to ourselves when
[52:14] we've come face to face with the word
[52:16] it's a dying to ourselves
[52:20] when the word is dealing with our life
[52:22] even in the initial parts where god is
[52:25] dealing with the life and justification
[52:28] and sanctification and the baptism of
[52:31] the holy ghost it's requiring a dying
[52:34] out to self
[52:37] and then when that takes place on the
[52:40] inside then we have a strength a power a
[52:44] life on the inside there is a new desire
[52:48] on the inside the desire to please the
[52:51] lord
[52:52] and by that desire to please the lord
[52:55] then comes the fulfillment of the
[52:56] scripture paul could say i die daily
[53:01] it's not struggling against sin it now
[53:03] comes to a place of things that could be
[53:05] absolutely lawful but we look at it and
[53:09] evaluated of is this going to take me
[53:12] out of the will of god how is this going
[53:15] to affect my family how's this going to
[53:17] affect my life you see now everything is
[53:20] everything all of our ambitions and all
[53:23] of our dreams have now come subject
[53:26] under the headship of the word
[53:29] and we can look to him and say lord if
[53:32] my dreams do not fit your program though
[53:35] i may desire to be this or do this or do
[53:38] that i want your will above my will
[53:43] that's the victory of gethsemane
[53:45] nevertheless not my will thine will be
[53:49] done
[53:50] [Applause]
[53:52] and what blessing that you and i
[53:55] have received because of that victory
[53:58] we now have received are you hearing me
[54:01] now we have received that same
[54:04] life that same quality of life inside of
[54:09] us to where that you and i have strength
[54:13] to yield our will to god's will
[54:20] oh hallelujah
[54:22] so the blessings of the lord are tied to
[54:25] obedience
[54:26] it's obedience to the things of god
[54:29] the bible said he giveth the holy ghost
[54:31] to them that
[54:33] obey him
[54:35] it's obedience it's simple obedience is
[54:37] simple obedience is not trying to figure
[54:39] it out obedience is simply do what he
[54:42] has said do
[54:44] don't turn from it to the right or left
[54:46] in other words don't reason here or
[54:48] reason here don't try to pass it
[54:51] because to try to pass around it then is
[54:54] to remove from the path of spiritual
[54:58] blessings
[55:02] now i want to just just taking this part
[55:05] here
[55:06] on you and i being partakers of this
[55:09] resurrection life and i want to just
[55:12] kind of cap back over a few things from
[55:14] last week i i just just feeling pressed
[55:16] in my heart here on saturday morning and
[55:19] i want to read this here on joshua 5 and
[55:21] 8 where they crossed they've crossed the
[55:24] jordan into the land
[55:27] there is memorials that are set up and
[55:30] here there is instruction by god that
[55:34] joshua was to make
[55:35] sharp knives and circumcise the children
[55:39] of israel again
[55:42] all part of this so that they might be
[55:44] partakers in other words they can't have
[55:48] the identity of egypt upon their life
[55:53] they can't be identical egypt is a type
[55:55] of the world not a location are you
[55:57] hearing me now
[55:58] it's just like in the scriptures when it
[56:00] says babylon the babylon the great is
[56:02] fallen in the book of revelations it
[56:04] ain't talking about a physical place
[56:06] it's talking about a spiritual condition
[56:10] a spirit of religion that is permeated
[56:13] throughout this entire world
[56:17] and you can see the effect of her
[56:19] religion
[56:21] it's a gathering listen now there's a
[56:23] gathering going on the gathering in the
[56:26] dispensation of the fullness of time
[56:28] fullness of times mean at the completion
[56:31] of the gentile ages
[56:34] it's a gathering and the bible said the
[56:36] gathering shall be unto him unto jesus
[56:40] christ himself
[56:42] the very fullness of god himself in the
[56:45] fullness of time and yet while that
[56:48] gathering is going on remember there was
[56:50] a jacob and an esau there was an abel
[56:53] and a cane
[56:54] is that right there was always twins and
[56:57] while that gathering is going on there's
[56:59] a gathering also that is taking place
[57:02] through that mother
[57:04] are you hearing me now
[57:06] it's a gathering that's going on it's
[57:08] permeated through all the
[57:10] world
[57:12] her religion now what has her religion
[57:14] produced it's a gathering
[57:17] just like you and i have been gathered
[57:19] spiritually in christ right no matter if
[57:22] you're in costa rica no matter if you're
[57:24] in honduras no matter if you're in
[57:25] lorraine no matter if you're in lima no
[57:28] matter if you're in christ that's the
[57:29] place to be
[57:31] because in christ is the place of
[57:33] rapture is that right
[57:35] so it's not a physical location it's a
[57:38] spiritual location
[57:40] where the promise of rapture is
[57:44] in christ
[57:46] right
[57:48] and notice how do we get into christ we
[57:51] come into christ by one spirit first
[57:53] corinthians 12 by one spirit we are all
[57:57] baptized into
[58:00] one body
[58:02] right
[58:03] and yet that's now on the contrast the
[58:06] spirit that's out there it's a gathering
[58:09] and she's gathering it through her
[58:11] teaching
[58:14] are you hearing me now
[58:16] she's gathered through her three chord
[58:18] her three chord teaching teaching in the
[58:21] name of father son and holy ghost
[58:25] well i don't know this this is not here
[58:28] but he knows where we're going and
[58:30] that's why that when you look at that
[58:32] all throughout the bible says that she
[58:35] has daughters
[58:39] now what are those daughters those
[58:40] donors are a product of what she is
[58:44] those that have forsaken the way of the
[58:47] lord
[58:48] is that what the bible says in the book
[58:50] of proverbs that she hath forsaken the
[58:53] paths of her youth
[58:55] are you hearing me now she had forsaken
[58:58] that she went she went in air went in
[59:00] perverseness now notice the gathering of
[59:03] her it is a cage full of every hatred
[59:08] and unclean foul bird
[59:12] this is a gathering she's gathering all
[59:14] the spirits all of these all of the
[59:16] peoples of the earth is being gathered
[59:19] together
[59:21] oh but we want to be gathered to the
[59:23] right place
[59:25] the world council of churches is
[59:27] gathering
[59:28] but this is god has sent a word in this
[59:31] hour because let me tell you something
[59:33] there is judgment on that image
[59:37] daniel pronounced it under the spirit of
[59:39] god and saw judgment come into that
[59:41] image that there would be a stone that
[59:44] would be cut out of a mountain without
[59:46] hands oh glory and the prophet said in
[59:49] this hour god in his grace had sent a
[59:52] message that he would catch you and i
[59:55] before that stone would smack the image
[59:58] that we can flee to him
[1:00:01] who is that stone that stone is christ
[1:00:05] jesus
[1:00:08] it's that revelation of christ
[1:00:13] that smites the image that breaks the
[1:00:15] yoke that that that that that does away
[1:00:19] with that foundation
[1:00:23] oh my
[1:00:26] oh my my my
[1:00:28] now here these partakers of resurrection
[1:00:31] life
[1:00:33] god as as it said in verse 8 and it came
[1:00:35] to pass when they had done
[1:00:38] circumcising
[1:00:40] all the people that they abode in their
[1:00:42] places in the camp till they were whole
[1:00:44] and the lord said unto joshua this day
[1:00:48] have i rolled away the reproach of egypt
[1:00:52] from off you
[1:00:56] well it was joshua that made short
[1:00:58] knives but he was obedient to the voice
[1:01:01] of god
[1:01:03] so god was letting him know because you
[1:01:05] have yielded yourself to my word
[1:01:08] this was not an easy thing to ask for
[1:01:11] but there's got to be a circumcision
[1:01:13] coming the camp
[1:01:15] are you hearing me i'm just going to be
[1:01:16] playing it would be painful for a little
[1:01:18] child
[1:01:20] but for grown men notice it shows what
[1:01:22] the word requires
[1:01:25] this is separating from egypt it's a
[1:01:28] cutting away but notice when it's all
[1:01:30] said and done
[1:01:32] god has placed it that this is my work
[1:01:35] that i have come down and i have rolled
[1:01:38] away the reproach of egypt from off you
[1:01:41] you know what you said brother samuel
[1:01:42] what would that mean when he would come
[1:01:44] to stand in battle they would know that
[1:01:47] i am standing here as a covenant jew i
[1:01:50] am in the covenant of abraham
[1:01:52] how are you in that covenant god himself
[1:01:55] has come down and god performed a
[1:01:58] circumcision on my life
[1:02:01] [Applause]
[1:02:02] they can say all you've got's a man's
[1:02:04] word no this ain't a man's word it's
[1:02:07] god's word there was an authority an
[1:02:10] anointing that came behind that word
[1:02:12] that they could say i am no longer bound
[1:02:15] to my first birth i'm no longer bound to
[1:02:18] egypt
[1:02:28] god removed
[1:02:30] the reproach the unbelief of egypt
[1:02:33] the world from off their lives now this
[1:02:35] is only a type
[1:02:37] of what the holy ghost comes to do
[1:02:40] in the life of the believer
[1:02:45] when god had called them into the land
[1:02:47] remember there were spies that went over
[1:02:50] and there was a great deal of them that
[1:02:52] said
[1:02:53] we can't take it
[1:02:55] and we've heard this over and over
[1:02:57] they can't we can't take it they came
[1:02:59] back over across the land even there
[1:03:01] were those
[1:03:02] who said give us our inheritance on this
[1:03:05] side
[1:03:08] you can read in the new testament of
[1:03:10] those and the effect of those staying on
[1:03:12] this side of jordan
[1:03:14] come on the tribe of god
[1:03:16] are you hearing me
[1:03:17] it was of the gatherings where there was
[1:03:19] that demon-possessed man
[1:03:21] there's an effect of staying out of the
[1:03:23] promise
[1:03:26] and they did not want to go on in to the
[1:03:28] promise of god they let me just say it
[1:03:30] plainly they were fine with being where
[1:03:34] they were they had come out of egypt
[1:03:36] they had walked through the red sea and
[1:03:38] here they were they were fine hate let
[1:03:41] us just dwell right here this is an okay
[1:03:43] place to raise our family we can have
[1:03:45] you know our cattle we can have all of
[1:03:47] this they settled down right there even
[1:03:50] in the midst of the 40 years they had no
[1:03:53] ambition
[1:03:56] i'm talking about spiritual ambition
[1:03:59] to go over
[1:04:01] even when they went even when god and
[1:04:04] and spoke to them that you must pass
[1:04:07] over with your brethren and you must
[1:04:09] fight alongside with them and once the
[1:04:12] land is subdued then you can return back
[1:04:15] across jordan and go back to your
[1:04:18] inheritance
[1:04:19] even seeing think of this these people
[1:04:23] saw giants whipped in the land
[1:04:28] they saw him taken down
[1:04:31] they had testimonies moses held a
[1:04:33] testimony meeting in the second third
[1:04:35] fourth honor remember which chapter of
[1:04:37] deuteronomy and begin to let them know
[1:04:39] that there were others that were not of
[1:04:41] the election but they had taken down
[1:04:44] giants
[1:04:45] you know why god gave them that portion
[1:04:50] are you hearing me now
[1:04:51] this is why you know there there be
[1:04:54] those that cannot see and walk within
[1:04:57] the light of the word but you know if
[1:04:59] they're able to live according to the
[1:05:01] portion that all that god has given them
[1:05:04] they will be blessed within that
[1:05:06] part are you hearing me but after seeing
[1:05:10] all these things supernaturally what god
[1:05:12] is doing it still did not rise anything
[1:05:15] within them i tell you friends if there
[1:05:17] ever ought to be an hour of real
[1:05:19] spiritual ambition
[1:05:21] this is the hour for spiritual ambition
[1:05:24] this is not the hour to become
[1:05:26] complacent this is not the hour to let
[1:05:30] down your garden let me say it very
[1:05:31] clearly it is not the hour to be
[1:05:34] occupied with the distractions of the
[1:05:37] enemy
[1:05:39] you cannot fight the devil by veering
[1:05:42] away from the word
[1:05:44] the only way you can ever fight satan is
[1:05:48] standing upon the word of god you might
[1:05:51] say i feel so weak let me tell you
[1:05:53] something the weakest christian that'll
[1:05:55] stand on the word of god it's more than
[1:05:58] a match for hell
[1:06:00] because it's the word
[1:06:04] every failure has taken place when god's
[1:06:07] children when one has let down on that
[1:06:10] word when satan can somehow get him to
[1:06:12] think or feel that their weapon is not
[1:06:16] greater he's disarmed him right there
[1:06:21] incredible to have a sword in your hand
[1:06:23] and yet be disarmed to not have
[1:06:24] confidence to use it
[1:06:27] that's satan's desire
[1:06:31] oh but we want to we want to be we we
[1:06:33] don't want to be caught listen friends
[1:06:35] in this hour if there ever was a time we
[1:06:38] need this is why we need the discernment
[1:06:40] of the holy spirit
[1:06:42] even as i heard the prayer go up tonight
[1:06:44] and i i believe our prayer should be in
[1:06:46] here tonight god let that discernment of
[1:06:48] the holy spirit ever pulsate my life
[1:06:51] lord as i'm reading the word as i'm
[1:06:53] listening to the message when i'm in
[1:06:54] prayer lord god i'm trusting in you
[1:06:57] remember brother branham said that that
[1:06:59] white horse rider as it was he said
[1:07:01] satan oh he said he can outdo the
[1:07:03] theologian he said but there's one that
[1:07:05] he cannot outdo and that's the holy
[1:07:08] ghost
[1:07:09] that's why we were made to be led by the
[1:07:12] spirit of god we do not trust our flesh
[1:07:15] or our abilities or how much we know we
[1:07:18] want the spirit of god to speak to our
[1:07:21] lives
[1:07:23] let me tell you something whether you
[1:07:25] know it or not you're still living in
[1:07:26] these flesh bodies it's easy for things
[1:07:29] to become common
[1:07:33] it's easy we have to battle against that
[1:07:36] we have to battle against things getting
[1:07:38] to a place to where now we become
[1:07:40] covered around with the veil of
[1:07:43] complacency then you know i'm all right
[1:07:45] and you know i believe that god sent a
[1:07:47] prophet i'm in the message i i really
[1:07:49] believe that that god's done a work in
[1:07:50] my life but when god has done a work in
[1:07:52] your life it is not so that you become a
[1:07:55] spectator
[1:07:56] it's now there are promises to be taken
[1:08:01] there's mountains to be taken they're
[1:08:03] cities to be brought down
[1:08:06] we're not we're not to be spectators now
[1:08:09] that the holy ghost has come that's the
[1:08:12] weapon that we needed to take down the
[1:08:15] giants that's the weapon that's needed
[1:08:18] to take every promise of god
[1:08:23] we need it
[1:08:24] but the veil of complacency i say oh god
[1:08:27] tonight let that veil of complacency let
[1:08:30] it be exposed tonight lord
[1:08:33] i say for every one of us oh god let it
[1:08:36] be exposed because we want to be people
[1:08:39] in this hour a pulsation of spiritual
[1:08:42] ambition
[1:08:44] what is it we've got a promise in this
[1:08:46] hour we're not preaching a promise to
[1:08:49] come we are preaching the promise of the
[1:08:51] coming of the lord the rapture it's upon
[1:08:54] us we have stepped into the cycle of
[1:08:58] that word
[1:09:00] do you realize we are experiencing the
[1:09:03] benefits
[1:09:05] the benefits of stepping into the cycle
[1:09:08] that has been opened to you and i
[1:09:12] is that right the prophet told the
[1:09:14] prophet was told by the angel of the
[1:09:16] lord before the for this great momentous
[1:09:19] decision that thou hast made it is my
[1:09:22] decision and you have made this decision
[1:09:26] this choice because of that a huge
[1:09:28] portion of heaven awaits you
[1:09:34] not just something over there
[1:09:37] we are recipients
[1:09:39] of the effects of that choosing right
[1:09:42] now
[1:09:43] brother samuel what did i have to do
[1:09:45] with it it was your choice but remember
[1:09:48] you came under the influence of the mind
[1:09:51] of almighty god
[1:09:52] [Music]
[1:09:56] when jacob spoke there in the book of
[1:09:58] jail genesis and jacob could say to this
[1:10:01] tribe you will be here and this tribe
[1:10:04] you will be here and this tribe you will
[1:10:06] be there it was not a maybe soul it was
[1:10:09] a certainty by divine inspiration that
[1:10:13] was tied into the names of those tribes
[1:10:17] and when joshua stepped on the scene
[1:10:19] what did he do he moved into that same
[1:10:21] channel of inspiration that here were
[1:10:24] the people that was promised now was
[1:10:27] coming into the effect of that promise
[1:10:32] or if we could say it tonight the cloud
[1:10:34] of many witnesses are looking over the
[1:10:36] banister of time
[1:10:38] do you realize why this book when this
[1:10:39] book has become open it's a cloud of
[1:10:42] witnesses now it's the voice of god
[1:10:46] that has thundered through every type in
[1:10:49] the scripture
[1:10:53] don't seal it up any longer but take the
[1:10:55] seals off of it
[1:10:57] amen let the seven fenders let the voice
[1:11:00] of god begin to speak it's god's voice
[1:11:02] it speaks through esther god's voice
[1:11:04] speaking through rebecca it's god's
[1:11:06] voice speaking through esther it's god's
[1:11:08] voice speaking through david and what
[1:11:10] does it say it is saying that my life
[1:11:14] was the prophecy concerning your life
[1:11:20] i wish i could preach how i really feel
[1:11:27] that's a friend this is the reality of
[1:11:29] where
[1:11:30] that we are living at
[1:11:32] in this hour
[1:11:35] it's a precious reality
[1:11:37] that god
[1:11:39] has committed
[1:11:41] into our lives into our hearts
[1:11:43] let me read here a portion of the
[1:11:45] scripture
[1:11:47] in colossians chapter 2 verse 10.
[1:11:51] and i read i read out of this one last
[1:11:52] week but i want to just read this this
[1:11:54] portion
[1:11:55] and ye are complete
[1:11:58] in him
[1:12:01] in him we are complete
[1:12:05] you see that that part that was that god
[1:12:08] placed within you
[1:12:10] that seed there was there was a thirst
[1:12:12] that you had for god
[1:12:15] and only he could satisfy that
[1:12:18] that seed was a womb
[1:12:20] a place that was jehovah jireh prepared
[1:12:23] for himself
[1:12:26] are you with me now that he himself now
[1:12:29] when he pours in his life and his spirit
[1:12:32] through the redemptive work of calvary
[1:12:35] now the holy spirit coming down what
[1:12:37] does it do it quickens that seed it now
[1:12:40] brings forth a new creation
[1:12:45] not the old man made over
[1:12:51] not a new coat we don't need a new coat
[1:12:55] you have to put a new man
[1:12:57] in that old coat
[1:13:01] because you can put a new coat on him a
[1:13:02] new shirt on him but he still has the
[1:13:04] same desires
[1:13:06] but if you'll deal with the desires on
[1:13:08] the inside
[1:13:10] then that change on the inside will
[1:13:14] manifest or declare itself through the
[1:13:17] old coat
[1:13:22] and you're complete in him
[1:13:25] i love that but i
[1:13:27] oh my we we're complete in him he is our
[1:13:30] perfection all that we have need of is
[1:13:34] in him
[1:13:35] is that right and we're in him and he is
[1:13:37] in us
[1:13:39] which is the head oh my of all
[1:13:42] principality and power in whom
[1:13:45] in whom also ye are circumcised with the
[1:13:48] circumcision made without hands
[1:13:53] so now this is not a circumcision by man
[1:13:57] which was given in a type
[1:14:00] in the old testament
[1:14:02] circumcision declared everything that's
[1:14:05] in the covenant belongs to you
[1:14:09] is that right
[1:14:10] you are part of the fellowship of the
[1:14:12] mystery you now have fellowship in the
[1:14:16] mystery fellowship in the covenant
[1:14:20] you see this is what they were asking
[1:14:22] for on the day of pentecost
[1:14:24] what must we do to be saved
[1:14:27] in other words let me just try to bring
[1:14:28] it down in layman's terms what have we
[1:14:30] got to do to be a part of this
[1:14:34] they saw something
[1:14:36] but they needed they knew there was
[1:14:38] something that was real that was there
[1:14:41] and they wanted to know what must we do
[1:14:43] to be saved
[1:14:46] and the prescription was given
[1:14:49] repent that's first of all
[1:14:54] and be baptized in the name of jesus
[1:14:58] christ for the remission of your sins
[1:15:02] is that right now peter had the keys
[1:15:04] there
[1:15:06] that's the revelation of father son holy
[1:15:09] ghost
[1:15:11] is that right he's what is he doing he's
[1:15:13] showing this is the path into spiritual
[1:15:16] blessings
[1:15:19] now that goes together repent and be
[1:15:22] baptized in the name of jesus christ for
[1:15:25] the remission of sins in other words the
[1:15:28] cutting off of all the past sins
[1:15:34] right
[1:15:35] but he's still got to deal with that sin
[1:15:38] nature
[1:15:40] see he forgives you of all all the past
[1:15:43] sins everything that was done in the
[1:15:45] past it's all forgiven
[1:15:47] but now when the holy ghost has come
[1:15:50] it brings forth that life on the inside
[1:15:54] to where the desires
[1:15:57] are no longer there
[1:16:01] it's a new
[1:16:02] creation
[1:16:05] that's
[1:16:06] the capping work of the holy spirit
[1:16:10] can i take my time here a minute
[1:16:13] i should be able to in the pastor
[1:16:15] but justification that's a work of the
[1:16:17] holy spirit it's not a man bringing
[1:16:20] bringing conviction to your heart it's
[1:16:22] the holy spirit
[1:16:24] that leads you lead it's the goodness of
[1:16:25] god that leads us to repentance
[1:16:28] then a further work of the holy spirit
[1:16:30] brings us to sanctification what is
[1:16:32] sanctification when we think differently
[1:16:37] you think differently about sin
[1:16:40] it's a it's a purging where there's
[1:16:42] things that i'm not doing this and i
[1:16:44] don't do this and i can't do that and i
[1:16:46] can't and we're saying i can't do this
[1:16:48] and i don't want to do this because we
[1:16:49] really we don't want to be displeasing
[1:16:52] to the lord
[1:16:54] but then there's a further work of the
[1:16:57] holy spirit a capping a capping is a
[1:17:01] finishing work to where he comes down
[1:17:04] and he brings a change on the inside
[1:17:08] where that seed that is laid there is
[1:17:11] now brought forth to life
[1:17:13] and so it's no longer you and i
[1:17:16] looking at well i i'm not not supposed
[1:17:19] to do this or i shouldn't do that but
[1:17:21] now there's a desire to fully please the
[1:17:24] lord
[1:17:32] in whom you also are circumcised
[1:17:34] with a circumcision made without hands
[1:17:39] so it takes the holy spirit
[1:17:41] to take the word
[1:17:43] and and bring the word to become a sword
[1:17:47] the word is a sword is it not
[1:17:49] but remember it's only as strong as the
[1:17:51] hand of faith that'll yield it
[1:17:54] right so there had to come a faith
[1:17:59] there had to come a faith that was able
[1:18:02] to handle the sword of the word in order
[1:18:05] to bring forth what the word was calling
[1:18:08] for
[1:18:10] god promised he would restore the faith
[1:18:15] he's restored that
[1:18:17] there was a vessel that was chosen and
[1:18:20] ordained by god to be moved into that
[1:18:24] realm that faith to where the word
[1:18:26] itself would be able to move in down to
[1:18:30] a life to cut away egypt
[1:18:34] in other words
[1:18:36] no
[1:18:36] lien of
[1:18:38] debt
[1:18:40] satan has not one lien
[1:18:43] on a born-again christian
[1:18:47] are you hearing me now he has not one
[1:18:49] lien
[1:18:50] because you can have a deed to a house
[1:18:54] deed to a property and you know you got
[1:18:56] a deed to it but there might be liens
[1:18:58] against it so-and-so ain't paid that
[1:18:59] twenty thousand dollar water bill
[1:19:02] right they'll back taxes on it did you
[1:19:04] got a deed to the land but you got liens
[1:19:06] against it
[1:19:08] the deed comes with believing the word
[1:19:13] but the holy ghost is the abstract that
[1:19:16] goes down and clears off every debt that
[1:19:20] was ever against you
[1:19:26] in whom we are circumcised with the
[1:19:28] circumcision made without hands in
[1:19:31] putting off this is what paul was
[1:19:33] talking about in putting off the body of
[1:19:35] the sins of the flesh by the
[1:19:37] circumcision of christ he's speaking of
[1:19:39] that old nature that's what the new
[1:19:41] birth
[1:19:42] comes for is to do away with that old
[1:19:46] nature
[1:19:49] we i've used this example over and over
[1:19:51] you know what happens if you snap off a
[1:19:53] weed
[1:19:57] you come to find out quickly why they
[1:19:59] got little tools that got that little
[1:20:00] splitter on them right there
[1:20:02] because you know why sometimes you got
[1:20:04] to get down in there and get them when
[1:20:05] they got a taproot or they've got those
[1:20:07] those other spread out route you got to
[1:20:09] get in there and get it because if you
[1:20:10] don't get it it's going to come back
[1:20:13] it'll look pretty good for a while but
[1:20:14] it'll come back
[1:20:17] circumcision by the spirit of god it
[1:20:20] goes to the root
[1:20:23] now notice
[1:20:24] buried with him in baptism wherein also
[1:20:27] ye are risen with him through the faith
[1:20:30] of the operation of god through the
[1:20:32] faith of the operation of god that's the
[1:20:34] holy ghost who hath raised him from the
[1:20:37] dead so when the holy ghost has come
[1:20:40] we are risen with him
[1:20:43] where are we risen with him
[1:20:45] in spiritual places
[1:20:48] where are we risen with him above every
[1:20:51] devil
[1:20:53] above every disease
[1:20:56] oh brother samuel we're still in this
[1:20:57] body but he has triumphed over satan's
[1:21:02] trinity
[1:21:04] death hell and the grave
[1:21:07] he rose up and said i was he i am he who
[1:21:10] was dead and am alive forevermore
[1:21:13] [Applause]
[1:21:14] he was given testimony that there were
[1:21:17] more that's going to come forth
[1:21:20] they are dead right now but they're
[1:21:22] going to come forth he went talking
[1:21:23] about out of the graveyard this is where
[1:21:26] he goes on to say in verse 13 and you
[1:21:29] being dead in your sins and the
[1:21:32] uncircumcision of your flesh this is
[1:21:35] where we were held
[1:21:37] we were dead that seed that was laying
[1:21:40] there the whole time
[1:21:44] but yet could not be manifest as a son
[1:21:46] of son or daughter of god
[1:21:50] the uncircumcision of our flesh hath he
[1:21:52] now hath he quickened together with him
[1:21:54] having forgiven you all
[1:21:56] trespasses blotting out the handwriting
[1:21:59] of ordinances that was against us which
[1:22:01] was contrary to us took it out of the
[1:22:03] way nailing it to the cross and having
[1:22:05] spoiled principalities and powers he
[1:22:08] made a show of them openly triumphing
[1:22:10] over them in it
[1:22:12] how sad it would be to read this and put
[1:22:15] it all back there on jesus and not to
[1:22:17] recognize that what he's did he made a
[1:22:20] pathway that you and i can come into
[1:22:23] this victory
[1:22:24] and it's not me that it's not my victory
[1:22:27] it's his victory living inside of my
[1:22:30] life
[1:22:32] we are victorious because he
[1:22:35] has
[1:22:36] overcome and because he has overcome now
[1:22:40] with that life inside of you and i we
[1:22:43] are made more than conquerors
[1:22:46] not just a conqueror
[1:22:49] napoleon was a conqueror
[1:22:52] the right hitler was a conqueror many
[1:22:54] were conquerors but it's more than
[1:22:57] conquerors because the ground that god
[1:22:59] has given us there is no retreat
[1:23:02] there is no losing this crowd when that
[1:23:05] victory has come we are more than
[1:23:08] conquerors we're not going back because
[1:23:10] there's nothing to go back to our lives
[1:23:13] have been changed we are more than
[1:23:16] conquerors
[1:23:17] [Applause]
[1:23:18] our victory has come the right way
[1:23:23] our victory did not come by drunkenness
[1:23:25] and people making deals in the back room
[1:23:28] but our victory came
[1:23:32] because our heavenly father
[1:23:35] came down
[1:23:37] in the body of flesh
[1:23:39] [Applause]
[1:23:43] the great creator became my savior
[1:23:48] and all god's fullness dwelleth in him
[1:23:52] he came down
[1:23:55] and he prevailed
[1:23:57] he overcame
[1:23:59] he was pulled against his will
[1:24:03] are you hearing me now
[1:24:05] there was a war that went on in
[1:24:06] gethsemane
[1:24:08] preach with me now we're going somewhere
[1:24:10] there was a war in gethsemane
[1:24:14] in the garden there was a war
[1:24:17] remember there was a war in the garden
[1:24:19] in the beginning
[1:24:22] and that war was lost there but in
[1:24:24] gethsemane
[1:24:25] [Applause]
[1:24:28] in this garden
[1:24:30] [Applause]
[1:24:32] may i say to you in this garden
[1:24:36] because he prevailed there in that of
[1:24:39] the oil press
[1:24:41] where his life was surrendered out now
[1:24:44] we the garden of god what is it it's
[1:24:48] christ
[1:24:49] prevailing
[1:24:51] in his garden
[1:24:52] [Applause]
[1:24:54] nevertheless not
[1:24:56] my will thine will be done
[1:25:00] is that not daily
[1:25:05] but what is it
[1:25:06] greater is he
[1:25:08] that's in the garden
[1:25:11] more than conquerors
[1:25:18] it's the life of the word
[1:25:21] that's moving within our lives notice
[1:25:23] this is the badge
[1:25:25] a believer this circumcision
[1:25:27] it's the badge of believers
[1:25:31] because this circumcision is the baptism
[1:25:34] of the holy ghost
[1:25:38] is that right it's the sign paul would
[1:25:41] write
[1:25:42] in romans 4 11 he received the sign of
[1:25:46] circumcision a seal of the righteousness
[1:25:49] of the faith which he had yet being
[1:25:52] uncircumcised
[1:25:54] so the faith itself
[1:25:56] it was stimulated
[1:25:59] now let me just go back a little bit
[1:26:05] in the message faith is a victory
[1:26:07] brother branham says abraham
[1:26:09] heard
[1:26:10] what god had done in the days of noah
[1:26:15] are you hearing me now what do you say
[1:26:17] but the same thing ain't written in the
[1:26:18] scripture but let's look at it here
[1:26:20] all right because you realize that enoch
[1:26:22] all of this here
[1:26:24] enoch was still around when adam was
[1:26:26] living
[1:26:27] they were in the coffee shop together
[1:26:29] he could hear adam talk about how the
[1:26:31] presence of god came down
[1:26:33] i mean it had to be a coffee shop but
[1:26:34] you understand what i'm saying
[1:26:37] but abraham brother abraham said what
[1:26:38] abraham did he heard
[1:26:40] and what god had done with noah
[1:26:43] and what it was about is how god had
[1:26:45] made himself so real he said to abram
[1:26:48] ask god lord make yourself real to me
[1:26:52] like that
[1:26:55] i'll tell you this brings it down to
[1:26:56] where you can put it in your lunch box
[1:26:59] he heard
[1:27:01] he heard what god did through noah and
[1:27:03] it caused him to say lord speak to me
[1:27:06] like that
[1:27:10] and he did and the lord said get thee
[1:27:12] out of thy kindrigan
[1:27:14] [Music]
[1:27:16] abraham did not do everything all at
[1:27:18] once but let me tell you something he
[1:27:20] made a move
[1:27:23] oh preach with me now he made a move
[1:27:27] there had to be some that he brought
[1:27:28] with him they had to pass away god had
[1:27:31] to allow things to arise then what
[1:27:33] everything was happening is god was
[1:27:36] stirring and stimulating his faith in
[1:27:38] the promise till eventually he would
[1:27:41] come to this place
[1:27:44] when he would meet god
[1:27:46] in genesis 17
[1:27:50] and god would let him know i am the
[1:27:52] almighty god
[1:27:56] walk before me and be thou perfect
[1:27:59] how can a man be perfect in himself he
[1:28:02] can't
[1:28:04] but if god opens up the way
[1:28:08] there's only one thing with god is
[1:28:10] perfection
[1:28:12] god was declaring i'm the life giver
[1:28:16] i'm the almighty god
[1:28:19] and the covenant that god said i'm gonna
[1:28:21] make my covenant with you
[1:28:24] now remember his covenant was i have
[1:28:26] already i have already i have already
[1:28:29] god had confirmed it now god what he
[1:28:31] confirmed he's going to vindicate it
[1:28:34] personally to abraham he's letting
[1:28:36] abraham know that what i confirmed back
[1:28:38] there are you hearing me now how i came
[1:28:40] down on the houston coliseum i confirmed
[1:28:42] my word what i've revealed and
[1:28:44] vindicated now i've come to you
[1:28:46] personally that i'm calling you i've
[1:28:48] come down to knock on your door can brew
[1:28:52] put you in the covenant with me
[1:28:56] when god comes down on the scene like he
[1:28:58] did with gideon god sent his word
[1:29:02] there was a prophet on the scene is that
[1:29:04] right
[1:29:05] after the prophet passed off the scene
[1:29:07] the angel of the lord that accompanies
[1:29:09] the message was still right there to
[1:29:11] take the message
[1:29:13] because that message god is not gonna
[1:29:15] let that message fall to the ground
[1:29:18] that message is gonna find its way into
[1:29:21] the heart of the elected gideon had
[1:29:24] heard it gideon was sitting in the
[1:29:26] meetings but now it came time for a
[1:29:29] personal visitation
[1:29:32] get in you've got to pass through the
[1:29:33] little room
[1:29:37] it's a personal visit in other words
[1:29:39] there's got to come to where that this
[1:29:41] message is not just something that's
[1:29:44] outside here but that message now it
[1:29:47] moves into your heart get in to where
[1:29:49] that your life begins to reflect my
[1:29:52] desire my ambition
[1:29:56] god said thou mighty man of valor and
[1:29:58] gideon turned around and said who else
[1:30:00] is here besides me
[1:30:03] because you want to know why gideon did
[1:30:05] not see himself as a mighty man of valor
[1:30:09] but god wasn't looking at his flesh
[1:30:11] anyhow
[1:30:15] what god was seeing down on the inside a
[1:30:17] mighty man of valor is a life that can
[1:30:20] be touched and will yield to the voice
[1:30:22] of god and will ask god to come and
[1:30:25] fulfill his word he will just take
[1:30:28] something presuming but it'll say if god
[1:30:31] be with us then where be all the
[1:30:33] miracles
[1:30:34] get in saying i just don't want to hear
[1:30:36] it i want to see it in my life
[1:30:40] god said that's it right there go in
[1:30:43] this thy night
[1:30:46] what's his might it's the strength of
[1:30:48] the lord confirming his promise
[1:30:54] glory be to god
[1:30:57] get in had a moment right there
[1:31:01] thou shalt smite the midianites
[1:31:03] as one
[1:31:05] man
[1:31:08] the angel of the lord brought that
[1:31:10] message it's a message of unity
[1:31:13] to the promise of god
[1:31:17] oh lord have mercy there's all sorts of
[1:31:20] golden nuggets on those blank spots
[1:31:26] but let me just try to to bring this
[1:31:28] this point down here
[1:31:30] where abraham was at
[1:31:33] think of this in our lives this this
[1:31:35] circumcision
[1:31:38] remember
[1:31:39] god let it be known that there's going
[1:31:41] to be opposition there's going to be
[1:31:43] things that will come when they would
[1:31:44] get over into the land
[1:31:47] they now was a dispossessing of all the
[1:31:50] inhabitants
[1:31:54] but they couldn't do it without the
[1:31:55] promise of god in their life
[1:31:59] you'll never be able to dispossess the
[1:32:01] inhabitants
[1:32:02] without the promise of the holy ghost
[1:32:05] in your life
[1:32:08] yet
[1:32:09] it takes the promise of the holy spirit
[1:32:12] listen friends there's battles that all
[1:32:14] throughout this building right here
[1:32:15] tonight
[1:32:17] when we cross over into the land of
[1:32:20] promise
[1:32:21] into the baptism of the holy ghost it
[1:32:23] doesn't do away with wars and battles
[1:32:26] are you hearing me now
[1:32:28] where the war in the battle stops
[1:32:31] is on the inside
[1:32:34] are you hearing me
[1:32:36] because that's the battle you need to
[1:32:37] get stopped first
[1:32:39] once that victory's won there then
[1:32:41] you've got the victory that'll it'll
[1:32:42] prove through every other victory
[1:32:44] every other battle it's strength it
[1:32:46] gives you strength faith is
[1:32:48] the victory
[1:32:50] that overcometh
[1:32:52] the world oppositions are there
[1:32:56] things are there before us
[1:32:58] but it's
[1:32:59] faith
[1:33:00] that is the victory
[1:33:04] faith that is the victory
[1:33:06] now i wish i could just
[1:33:09] i wish i could just keep preaching here
[1:33:13] but let me just try to
[1:33:17] finish this part up here a little bit
[1:33:18] and we're not even going to get to that
[1:33:20] but
[1:33:21] i want you to think of this
[1:33:24] abraham
[1:33:26] brother brown would place it like this
[1:33:27] in the message confirmation and evidence
[1:33:32] and
[1:33:33] i know this is very simple
[1:33:36] but when abraham was getting old
[1:33:39] and the bible said that his body was as
[1:33:41] good as dead what you think
[1:33:43] he met el shaddai
[1:33:46] or he met the same god
[1:33:49] that he had met in other places
[1:33:53] through vision
[1:33:55] dreams
[1:33:56] lights are you hearing me
[1:33:58] see god has many listen
[1:34:01] god gives you many experiences
[1:34:05] and you might and sometimes we well you
[1:34:07] know i've had this experience and it may
[1:34:09] not be the capping experience but don't
[1:34:12] despise it
[1:34:14] let it build your faith
[1:34:17] because listen let me tell you something
[1:34:19] not everybody has them experiences
[1:34:25] it's only when god deals with you know
[1:34:27] why the presence of god comes around
[1:34:28] your life
[1:34:29] is because it takes the presence of god
[1:34:32] coming around to start to awaken the
[1:34:35] seed
[1:34:36] even though it doesn't maybe quicken it
[1:34:38] right away it takes the presence of god
[1:34:41] to begin to awaken the seed to the
[1:34:45] promise of the one that is right there
[1:34:48] before them
[1:34:50] [Applause]
[1:34:56] that's why brother bram could say he
[1:34:58] said a son of god talking about the
[1:34:59] eagle in the chicken yard talking about
[1:35:01] the prodigal son he said ex-son of god
[1:35:04] can go a long time
[1:35:07] before recognizing who he is
[1:35:11] it's why staying in the presence of the
[1:35:13] word oh my
[1:35:15] lord have mercy friend this is the
[1:35:17] simplicity of the obedience if you'll
[1:35:19] stay under the presence of the word the
[1:35:21] god who's dealing with your life the
[1:35:24] same god who's dealing with your life
[1:35:26] he's not an indian giver he's not there
[1:35:28] to play with your emotions the god who
[1:35:30] deals with your life is there to move on
[1:35:33] your life and do a real work on the
[1:35:36] inside
[1:35:37] i'm telling you there is nobody that's
[1:35:39] more true than jesus
[1:35:42] [Applause]
[1:35:44] i can promise you things and i'll have
[1:35:46] to text you and say can't make it
[1:35:48] brother ray sorry not able to do it
[1:35:50] today but not jesus
[1:35:53] he don't have he's not looking for an
[1:35:55] excuse
[1:35:57] he don't have to say can't meet that one
[1:35:59] he knows and he keeps every appointment
[1:36:03] [Applause]
[1:36:05] your situation is not too big for him
[1:36:11] he blotted out all
[1:36:14] he triumphed over all principalities
[1:36:17] [Applause]
[1:36:22] hallelujah
[1:36:26] abraham getting old
[1:36:27] his body his body brother joshua was
[1:36:30] speaking contrary to the promise
[1:36:35] maybe his hunch got gotten more maybe he
[1:36:38] was having to do the arthritic stretches
[1:36:40] getting out of bed
[1:36:43] oh
[1:36:45] where are you at now well half hour
[1:36:47] after waking up sitting on the side of
[1:36:48] the bed now
[1:36:51] his body was as good as dead now we know
[1:36:53] that was life he could not reproduce any
[1:36:55] more children
[1:36:57] but you understand
[1:36:58] his body was as good a dead in other
[1:37:00] words
[1:37:01] god let abraham get to a place that he
[1:37:03] has he brings every seed of abraham
[1:37:07] to where god says i don't need your help
[1:37:12] this birth this birth this
[1:37:14] transformation it's not you doing
[1:37:16] something i do not need your help i
[1:37:19] don't need you to manufacture something
[1:37:21] i just need you to get to a place to
[1:37:23] where you realize i can do nothing
[1:37:26] without him
[1:37:30] and god said praise god i've got him
[1:37:32] right where i want him now let me make
[1:37:34] myself known as el shaddai
[1:37:37] you're weak i'm strong
[1:37:41] [Applause]
[1:37:43] hallelujah
[1:37:44] he reveals himself that i'm stronger
[1:37:47] than any habit i'm stronger than any
[1:37:49] desire i'm stronger than any family
[1:37:51] strength i am greater than every
[1:37:54] affliction i'm stronger than any bruise
[1:37:57] that happened in your life i'm greater
[1:37:59] than any broken heart i am greater
[1:38:03] i am your provided
[1:38:14] lamb i didn't have to preach i believe
[1:38:17] i'd run
[1:38:18] [Music]
[1:38:24] he was good as dead can i read this to
[1:38:26] you brother braham said he was good as
[1:38:28] dead but he could look down to this sign
[1:38:31] in his flesh and know that it was god's
[1:38:33] token that he'd keep his word
[1:38:35] circumcision
[1:38:36] look at the evidence and say god made
[1:38:40] the promise
[1:38:41] look at the evidence in your life and
[1:38:44] say god made the promise
[1:38:46] because it's the holy spirit that brings
[1:38:48] it to pass he's the enforcer of the word
[1:38:53] sarah said i'm 90 and i'm far past any
[1:38:56] act of life but then abraham could turn
[1:38:58] and look you catching this sarah could
[1:39:00] say this but abraham had a place to turn
[1:39:03] and look to oh my we're not looking way
[1:39:06] off in some distant land we're looking
[1:39:08] unto jesus and might i say this i don't
[1:39:11] have to look to this building i'm
[1:39:14] looking to the living lord jesus that is
[1:39:16] veiled inside of our life it is the seal
[1:39:20] of the living god the holy spirit has
[1:39:22] brought thee i was the i am and that i
[1:39:25] will be to be present in our lives
[1:39:29] i'm not looking somewhere else
[1:39:32] i'm looking to jesus
[1:39:35] a lot of discouraging things can stand
[1:39:37] right before us
[1:39:40] the enemy will come at you one way
[1:39:44] but he said i'll smite him in your
[1:39:46] presence
[1:39:48] david said thou hast prepared
[1:39:51] a table
[1:39:52] in the presence of mind enemies
[1:39:57] [Applause]
[1:39:59] what's a table it's where you eat
[1:40:03] we are feasting on the work of all
[1:40:07] almighty god
[1:40:13] sarah said this is not possible it's too
[1:40:16] old you can listen whatever your need is
[1:40:19] you can put that right in there the
[1:40:21] doctor said this my husband said this my
[1:40:23] wife said this my family said this my
[1:40:26] boss said you can put anything you want
[1:40:28] in there my children are this or put it
[1:40:30] all in there but abraham
[1:40:33] could turn and look at the evidence
[1:40:36] you've got something to look at
[1:40:39] don't you let the devil steal your eyes
[1:40:41] and focus them on those things
[1:40:45] hallelujah
[1:40:46] i'm speaking denied by inspiration
[1:40:49] stand still and see the salvation of the
[1:40:53] lord
[1:40:57] those egyptians
[1:40:59] that you see and that you hear
[1:41:05] you ain't going to see them no more
[1:41:06] after this day
[1:41:10] stand still
[1:41:12] and see the salvation of the lord
[1:41:15] i'm talking about the blessings of the
[1:41:17] lord this is the pathway in the victory
[1:41:20] the pathway of our rejoicing
[1:41:24] oh god
[1:41:25] abraham could turn
[1:41:27] and look at the evidence that god had
[1:41:30] said and said this is a token and
[1:41:32] abraham could give glory to god and be
[1:41:35] stronger than ever
[1:41:37] because it was a token a confirmation
[1:41:40] that god was going to grant it to him
[1:41:45] he could look at the unfailing work
[1:41:48] of el shaddai
[1:41:50] in his life
[1:41:54] he was drawing strength
[1:41:57] from the strength giver
[1:42:00] situation presented itself brother dave
[1:42:03] that was there to challenge
[1:42:05] challenge the promise in his life
[1:42:07] the promise that god give remember
[1:42:10] he turned and looked at the evidence in
[1:42:12] his life and said but god made the
[1:42:14] promise
[1:42:17] satan can say you're not going to make
[1:42:19] it you can turn to the evidence in your
[1:42:21] life and say god made the promise
[1:42:27] it don't have nothing to do with your
[1:42:28] feelings
[1:42:31] i'm thinking about the prayer letter
[1:42:33] right now that the prophet sent out he
[1:42:34] said it's time for you to doubt your
[1:42:36] doubts
[1:42:39] and to believe god's word and to begin
[1:42:42] calling anything contrary as though it
[1:42:45] were not that's abraham's seed
[1:42:47] oh brother samuel that's make believe it
[1:42:49] ain't make belief
[1:42:51] because we realize who art thou on great
[1:42:53] mountain before zerubbabel thou shalt
[1:42:56] become a plane
[1:42:59] you know what that is an announcement of
[1:43:00] of the
[1:43:01] working of the holy spirit that would be
[1:43:04] present in the sons and daughters of god
[1:43:07] in the last day there would be great
[1:43:09] mountains and great opposition but there
[1:43:11] is a greater one than the mountain that
[1:43:14] is before you and that is almighty god
[1:43:17] el shaddai you can look at the evidence
[1:43:20] in your life and say god made the
[1:43:22] promise
[1:43:24] i'm not here by myself
[1:43:27] you're not by yourself
[1:43:29] he said i'll be with you
[1:43:32] even in you
[1:43:34] to the end of the age
[1:43:37] [Applause]
[1:43:38] [Music]
[1:43:42] can i read one more
[1:43:45] same message
[1:43:47] now look
[1:43:48] back where you once were
[1:43:51] look where you've raised up to now
[1:43:53] you died with christ you were buried in
[1:43:56] his name you raised with him in
[1:43:58] resurrection spiritually tonight
[1:44:00] according to the word we are now risen
[1:44:02] with him sitting in heavenly places in
[1:44:04] christ jesus and every conquered devil
[1:44:07] under the feet of him sitting in the
[1:44:09] living presence of the lord jesus
[1:44:12] oh
[1:44:14] if that ought to give you a hold on
[1:44:15] something
[1:44:16] to see him with that same evidence that
[1:44:19] same faith that was once delivered to
[1:44:21] the saints now in operation doing the
[1:44:23] same things today that it always did see
[1:44:26] the appearing of the lord jesus among us
[1:44:29] and looking back
[1:44:31] and see where we once were
[1:44:34] and now where we are now
[1:44:38] see we're not looking back
[1:44:41] like lot's wife
[1:44:43] [Applause]
[1:44:44] lot's life was looking back to what she
[1:44:46] was still tied to
[1:44:52] she she turned her head but it was
[1:44:54] stealing her heart
[1:44:56] and eventually she's turned out as an
[1:44:58] overcomer
[1:44:59] she started out as an overcomer but
[1:45:02] eventually
[1:45:03] she started hearing cries coming from
[1:45:05] sodom
[1:45:06] things have started tugging on her
[1:45:09] till eventually
[1:45:10] she turned around
[1:45:12] and looked back
[1:45:15] and she became a pillar of salt
[1:45:17] this is why jesus
[1:45:19] we utter those three words
[1:45:22] remember
[1:45:23] lot's
[1:45:25] wife
[1:45:27] she started out an overcomer
[1:45:30] but eventually
[1:45:32] the world overtook her
[1:45:36] you know why
[1:45:37] because she didn't keep going on
[1:45:42] it's obeying the voice of god
[1:45:45] it's keep moving on
[1:45:48] walk in the light as he's in the light
[1:45:52] see we look back to where we once were
[1:45:54] see when we we look back we're not
[1:45:56] looking back with a longing to go back
[1:45:58] god remember god would tell israel
[1:46:00] remember where i brought you from
[1:46:02] that's part of battle plans let me tell
[1:46:04] you something that's part of battle plan
[1:46:06] when you can look back and realize wait
[1:46:08] a minute i didn't get my i didn't bring
[1:46:10] myself out god brought me out
[1:46:14] oh brother samuel that's pretty simple
[1:46:16] the same god that brought you out there
[1:46:18] the same god brought you where you are
[1:46:19] now is the same god that'll take you on
[1:46:23] you see what it does when you look back
[1:46:25] you're it's faith in el shaddai who's
[1:46:28] present in your life
[1:46:31] and that's why even when you're
[1:46:33] approaching the baptism of the holy
[1:46:35] ghost where god has brought you from the
[1:46:37] same god that brought you and turns your
[1:46:40] heart some of you wouldn't even sit in a
[1:46:41] meeting like this
[1:46:43] you might have been raised around it but
[1:46:45] you didn't want you didn't want nothing
[1:46:46] to do with you were out there sowing
[1:46:47] your wild oats and everything you had
[1:46:48] another i don't want nothing to do with
[1:46:49] that or what what turns you around
[1:46:54] help me preach now what turns you around
[1:46:56] god turns you around
[1:47:00] you got to get pointed in the right
[1:47:01] direction you pull up to somebody and
[1:47:03] say hey you know what um
[1:47:06] i'm lost honey okay where are you going
[1:47:09] that's the first thing they're going to
[1:47:10] ask you right where are you going
[1:47:13] well i'm trying to get to so and so and
[1:47:15] so and so
[1:47:16] and they'll tell you all right
[1:47:18] you need to go make a left right here
[1:47:20] and you go down this way you see what it
[1:47:22] is they've got to get you going in the
[1:47:23] right direction
[1:47:25] you and i were headed in the wrong
[1:47:27] direction
[1:47:29] but god's the one that brings us and
[1:47:31] points us in the right direction and the
[1:47:33] same god that does that remember it's a
[1:47:35] path into the spiritual blessing that
[1:47:38] same god he's right there walking with
[1:47:41] you to guide you all the way
[1:47:47] man
[1:47:50] i'm not a man of myself but
[1:47:53] lord have mercy
[1:47:55] we were dead then and now we're alive
[1:47:58] and as sure as we were dead and buried
[1:48:00] with him we've raised with him in the
[1:48:02] resurrection for we've raised up from
[1:48:04] down there
[1:48:06] oh brother brandon said i feel religious
[1:48:08] now we're dead in our lives as hidden
[1:48:11] god through christ and sealed by the
[1:48:12] holy ghost i look back and i see where i
[1:48:15] once was
[1:48:16] that william branham died 32 years ago
[1:48:20] and now we're a new creation in christ
[1:48:22] already raised with him and sitting with
[1:48:25] him now in heavenly places with the
[1:48:27] authority of his promised word that
[1:48:29] every devil is subject to us
[1:48:33] in my name
[1:48:36] they shall cast out devils
[1:48:41] in my name
[1:48:43] it's the presence
[1:48:45] of god
[1:48:47] in the life of the believer
[1:48:52] you see
[1:48:53] this evidence
[1:48:55] is just where we come to as paul could
[1:48:57] say
[1:48:58] in philippians 3 3 for we are the
[1:49:00] circumcision
[1:49:01] which worship god in the spirit
[1:49:05] and rejoice in christ jesus
[1:49:08] and have no confidence
[1:49:10] in the flesh
[1:49:14] you see with this circumcision
[1:49:17] of jesus christ
[1:49:19] we're united with him in a union
[1:49:24] remember
[1:49:26] here within the old testament
[1:49:28] that circumcision it pertained to the
[1:49:30] male
[1:49:31] every male child right
[1:49:33] but the only way
[1:49:35] that that of
[1:49:36] of the female could become into that of
[1:49:39] the covenant it came through marriage
[1:49:42] it came through a union
[1:49:45] are you hearing me there's many places
[1:49:46] in the scripture we could go to even
[1:49:48] when the daughters of zelaphia zolofi
[1:49:51] had
[1:49:51] their father passed away
[1:49:54] right he had no sons
[1:49:56] so what happens to his part in the
[1:49:58] inheritance
[1:49:59] and that inspiration moved upon the
[1:50:01] daughters of zelafia you know they they
[1:50:03] could have sat there and said well we
[1:50:05] don't our dad didn't have no sons there
[1:50:07] isn't you know our inheritance is gone
[1:50:09] you say brothers tell me what was that
[1:50:11] it was more
[1:50:12] it was more than just a natural desire
[1:50:16] it was the inspiration of the holy
[1:50:18] spirit that moved upon those daughters
[1:50:21] and they asked shall our fathers
[1:50:24] inheritance pass away
[1:50:27] our father who stood with caleb and
[1:50:30] joshua
[1:50:32] he agreed that the land was for us
[1:50:35] oh they had a testimony in their home
[1:50:37] our daddy stood with this message our
[1:50:40] daddy stood with this word
[1:50:46] moses took it before god
[1:50:48] and when he took it before god
[1:50:50] god said
[1:50:51] that's right
[1:50:53] but the only way
[1:50:55] they can have of that inheritance they
[1:50:57] must marry
[1:50:59] within their own tribe
[1:51:01] because you see that land cannot pass
[1:51:04] from one tribe to another
[1:51:08] what god has in ordained for you cannot
[1:51:12] be passed to another
[1:51:14] it's been ordained for you
[1:51:18] spiritual blessings in christ jesus
[1:51:22] this is our inheritance
[1:51:25] and through union
[1:51:27] we come into our inheritance
[1:51:30] that union
[1:51:32] is the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:51:34] that union is the circumcision
[1:51:37] that union is the seal of god
[1:51:40] that union is the new birth
[1:51:48] let's pray
[1:51:52] heavenly father
[1:51:55] as you spoke lord by inspiration through
[1:51:58] david
[1:52:02] that lord the path of life thou wilt
[1:52:05] show me the path of life
[1:52:08] and in thy presence
[1:52:10] at thy right hand
[1:52:13] our pleasures
[1:52:15] ever more in the fullness of joy
[1:52:19] not the joy that the
[1:52:21] world would give
[1:52:23] but a joy
[1:52:26] that you give lord
[1:52:28] that joy that is
[1:52:30] it was wrote
[1:52:32] in the time of nehemiah
[1:52:34] the joy
[1:52:36] of the lord
[1:52:37] is our strength
[1:52:40] lord
[1:52:41] the joy of the lord
[1:52:44] it's our strength
[1:52:47] in these temporary dwellings
[1:52:50] in these temporary booths
[1:52:52] in these tabernacles it's the joy of the
[1:52:55] lord
[1:52:57] the lord is
[1:52:58] you wrote here in the word where the
[1:53:00] blessings would overtake
[1:53:02] the blessings
[1:53:04] of the lord the blessing travels through
[1:53:07] the word
[1:53:08] lord
[1:53:09] as david could make that request lord
[1:53:12] this is the very desire of our hearts
[1:53:14] lord order my steps in your word lord
[1:53:19] david the lord would express through the
[1:53:21] psalms he was expressing
[1:53:23] what we as lord as believers that have
[1:53:25] been born of your spirit when david
[1:53:27] would say teach me lord
[1:53:29] quicken thy word to my heart lord teach
[1:53:32] me lord your word
[1:53:34] david was calling upon you lord that
[1:53:37] that word that you would come you would
[1:53:40] quicken the lord you would teach him
[1:53:42] lord that that word
[1:53:44] would come to pass in his life
[1:53:47] david was speaking under inspiration for
[1:53:50] what would be restored through the lamb
[1:53:53] of god
[1:53:54] where lord
[1:53:57] you would stand there upon earth and say
[1:54:00] the son can do nothing in himself
[1:54:03] but what he sees the father doing
[1:54:05] that doeth the son likewise that was
[1:54:08] restoring back that was a restoring back
[1:54:11] to us
[1:54:13] the lord would not be
[1:54:15] us learning
[1:54:17] from the hands of a man you use men but
[1:54:19] it's you it's not man man cannot give
[1:54:22] understanding to man
[1:54:25] it's you lord you're the teacher you
[1:54:27] gave yourself lord to the church
[1:54:32] you're our tutor you're a comforter lord
[1:54:35] that god it's you that comes lord and
[1:54:38] and reveals your word and lord we're
[1:54:42] we're asking o god that you'll continue
[1:54:44] to reveal your word to our hearts lord
[1:54:48] like david can say their lord in the
[1:54:50] psalms
[1:54:51] teach my hands lord to war
[1:54:55] teach us lord like joshua went up before
[1:54:58] jericho he was asking you teach my hands
[1:55:02] to war in this battle lord
[1:55:06] oh father i pray tonight lord
[1:55:10] as we're standing here lord in your
[1:55:12] presence and
[1:55:14] lord jesus
[1:55:16] every need that's gathered here lord
[1:55:20] may hearts that
[1:55:22] lord that you've touched and and stirred
[1:55:24] but maybe they haven't come to that
[1:55:26] place yet but lord i can rejoice with
[1:55:29] them that they've repented they've been
[1:55:32] baptized in the name of the lord jesus
[1:55:34] christ we can rejoice that lord they're
[1:55:36] standing there and there's a
[1:55:38] sanctification moving in their life we
[1:55:41] can rejoice in that but god we rejoice
[1:55:44] and with also an encouragement to say
[1:55:47] press on to perfection
[1:55:50] let let god finish the work in your life
[1:55:54] let just just keep continue to yield to
[1:55:57] his voice continue to yield to him and
[1:56:01] things that are not under understood and
[1:56:03] you say i maybe don't understand but
[1:56:05] when you hear his voice speaking to you
[1:56:07] invite him to say lord
[1:56:10] come
[1:56:10] abide in my home and teach me lord
[1:56:15] take lord the bread and break it lord
[1:56:19] lord reveal this word to me lord come
[1:56:22] lord make yourself real lord to my life
[1:56:25] to my heart
[1:56:26] lord oh granted lord
[1:56:30] father
[1:56:32] hearts and lives lord
[1:56:34] those lord those of us lord that dear
[1:56:37] god have come lord into that
[1:56:39] circumcision by the grace of god we
[1:56:41] didn't bring ourselves there
[1:56:44] we didn't make ourselves good enough
[1:56:47] we couldn't lord
[1:56:50] lord it's like abraham when he come to a
[1:56:52] place
[1:56:53] where he was as good as dead
[1:56:56] and you stepped on the scene lord
[1:56:59] i pray heavenly father tonight o god
[1:57:03] that lord throughout this building lord
[1:57:06] there's no doubt lord what you said in
[1:57:08] the word
[1:57:10] where it spoke there that particular
[1:57:12] scripture the lord
[1:57:14] will cause
[1:57:16] will smite thine enemy that would rise
[1:57:18] up before you
[1:57:21] lord
[1:57:22] every devil
[1:57:25] every sickness
[1:57:27] every disease
[1:57:29] lord i i all i know is to say how you
[1:57:32] came to the prophet because i could stay
[1:57:34] here all day and try to name off
[1:57:35] everyone
[1:57:36] but when you came to the prophet
[1:57:39] and that serpent lord came there on the
[1:57:41] roadway
[1:57:43] it said speak the word and bind him.
[1:57:46] and it said
[1:57:47] it's this
[1:57:48] and
[1:57:49] all else is bound
[1:57:52] that's the authority because it's not a
[1:57:54] man's word
[1:57:56] it's you lord the head
[1:57:59] the head the author
[1:58:02] you've come to your body
[1:58:04] the marriage of the lamb
[1:58:08] is come

[1:58:16] that you're our husband

[1:58:21] head
[1:58:24] the key of david

[1:58:45] i'm your strength when you feel like you
[1:58:47] can't make another step where you you
[1:58:49] are weak i i'm your strength
[1:58:52] oh dear heavenly father
[1:58:55] granted tonight lord
[1:58:58] lord we're not going to look at the
[1:58:59] opposition like like abraham lord as you
[1:59:02] spoke through your prophet right there
[1:59:04] sarah said i'm too old abraham
[1:59:07] but god
[1:59:09] oh jesus
[1:59:11] abraham
[1:59:13] yielded himself to be a channel he could
[1:59:15] not change
[1:59:17] serie i
[1:59:18] it had already been spoke to him you
[1:59:20] called her sarah but she needed to have
[1:59:22] that revelation on her own
[1:59:25] abraham did not go into the tent and try
[1:59:27] to convince her but god he became a
[1:59:31] channel
[1:59:33] a channel that lord god that you could
[1:59:36] move down lord in a visitation and deal
[1:59:39] with sarah's heart lord
[1:59:41] though her name that had been pronounced
[1:59:44] over her sarah but oh god that was to
[1:59:47] awaken that one on the inside that would
[1:59:50] that would yield to the breath of
[1:59:53] almighty god
[1:59:55] oh lord god it was to call the eye to a
[1:59:58] place in syria's name to where i would
[2:00:01] come to a place of submission and
[2:00:04] agreeance with the word to realize i
[2:00:07] can't do this
[2:00:09] then
[2:00:11] the same one who brewed upon the earth
[2:00:14] in the beginning luak
[2:00:17] elohim
[2:00:18] could breathe
[2:00:20] there into sarah's life
[2:00:23] oh glory be to god her name was no
[2:00:26] longer sharia she was identified by the
[2:00:30] breath of almighty god
[2:00:32] glory be to god
[2:00:36] is that not what you did father when you
[2:00:39] called your disciples together in john
[2:00:41] 20 you called them together after the
[2:00:44] resurrection and the bible said you
[2:00:46] breathed upon them and said receive ye
[2:00:49] the holy ghost you was announcing to
[2:00:51] them that the coming of the holy ghost
[2:00:54] was the breath of almighty god
[2:00:57] hallelujah the same one that could
[2:01:00] remove the eye from your name
[2:01:03] and place the h
[2:01:06] the one with uplifted hands
[2:01:09] hallelujah
[2:01:11] who swore by him there is no one greater
[2:01:14] glory be a god in the highest
[2:01:16] oh jesus
[2:01:20] abraham
[2:01:21] could turn his eyes
[2:01:24] and we as your children tonight
[2:01:26] can turn our eyes
[2:01:29] from all
[2:01:31] all objects
[2:01:33] of unbelief
[2:01:34] words of doubt
[2:01:36] we got an evidence to look at

[2:01:43] we could go over there to israel i'd
[2:01:45] like to go there someday we could go
[2:01:47] there and we could look at an empty tomb
[2:01:49] but we've got a greater evidence
[2:01:53] than an empty tomb
[2:01:55] we've got the evidence
[2:01:57] that he who was dead is alive
[2:02:00] forevermore
[2:02:02] because i was dead
[2:02:04] i was once dead
[2:02:06] but now i am alive i have been quick and
