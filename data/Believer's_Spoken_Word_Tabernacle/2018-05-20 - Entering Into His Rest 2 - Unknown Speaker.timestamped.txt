[43:47] life
[43:48] thank you for those beautiful songs
[43:50] girls that was that was wonderful I love
[43:52] having a family that can sing they just
[43:56] add so much to a service and we
[43:58] appreciate them
[44:00] you never come and be with us today like
[44:03] you to turn in your Bibles this morning
[44:05] if you would to Hebrews chapter four and
[44:08] I want to continue on with the thought I
[44:11] was on back a couple months ago when I
[44:13] was here of entering into his rest and
[44:17] I'm going to put this part to enter into
[44:21] his rest part two and I want to leave
[44:26] some things in here today that perhaps
[44:28] would be a help to some and and perhaps
[44:32] maybe someone you know it might benefit
[44:35] from these thoughts today of entering
[44:37] into his rest let's read together let us
[44:41] this is Hebrews 4:1 let us therefore
[44:44] fear lest a promise being left us of
[44:47] entering to his rest any of you should
[44:50] seem to come short of it for unto us was
[44:54] the gospel preached as well as unto them
[44:56] but the word preached did not profit
[44:59] them not being mixed with faith in them
[45:04] that heard it for we which have believed
[45:07] to enter into rest as he said as I have
[45:11] sworn in my wrath if they shall enter
[45:14] into my rest although the works were
[45:17] finished from the foundation of the
[45:21] world
[45:22] let's pray Heavenly Father we want to
[45:26] thank you dear God for the privilege of
[45:30] being here this morning
[45:31] I thank you for strengthen our bodies
[45:33] Lord to come to the house
[45:35] God and to serve you and to love you
[45:38] Lord we can't thank you enough father
[45:40] for what you've done and what you've
[45:42] given us we pray today God you just
[45:44] bless us now as we break bread together
[45:47] come and speak to our hearts Lord we
[45:50] pray from your book I have your
[45:52] preeminence and everything that's said
[45:54] and done here today where we give you
[45:56] the praise and the honor and the glory
[45:58] and we ask it all in Jesus name Amen the
[46:02] church said amen amen god bless you you
[46:05] may be seated so I want to continue on
[46:09] if I can with the message the thought of
[46:11] entering into his rest our text that we
[46:14] read here said we should fear lest we
[46:19] come short of it notice it didn't say we
[46:24] reject it we deny it or we refuse it
[46:32] it just said to fear lest we come short
[46:36] that simply means to stop short or not
[46:39] to go far enough not to enter in so I
[46:44] want to back up if I can this morning
[46:46] and just I'll regroup a little bit and
[46:48] this is more of a teaching service this
[46:51] morning than evangelistic so you have to
[46:54] put on your thinking caps a little bit I
[46:55] have a lot of scripture that I want to
[46:58] get to today as we bring this thought
[46:59] out and there's this purpose for it so
[47:02] if you've got a pen and paper you might
[47:04] want to write them down that way you'll
[47:06] have them to go back and reference and
[47:10] if you can keep up that's good otherwise
[47:12] they they put them on the screen so I
[47:14] think that's a wonderful thing so let me
[47:16] just recap a little bit of what we
[47:17] talked about when we were here the last
[47:19] time we started out you remember talking
[47:21] about the crazy world that we live in
[47:24] and how the world is falling apart we
[47:27] talked about the message letting all
[47:29] pressure how that everybody's running
[47:31] and rushing and going everywhere and
[47:33] going nowhere and it's an age of nervous
[47:34] tension causing us two things to do
[47:37] something wrong or to act out of place
[47:39] we said that's just what the devil wants
[47:41] us to do he wants to get us off balance
[47:43] so we'll do something wrong or we're act
[47:45] out of place that's his job so he tries
[47:48] to keep us
[47:49] nervous upset and get to a place that we
[47:54] can't we can't function properly the
[47:56] pressures of this age you said was three
[47:59] things riches soft living and nervous
[48:06] tension that's the pressures of this age
[48:10] the pressures of riches you can't you
[48:14] can't make it with one job anymore
[48:15] Hartley too many pressures gotta have
[48:20] this got to have that got to keep up
[48:22] with the Joneses it's got to keep up
[48:23] with mom and dad got to do what
[48:24] everybody else is doing
[48:26] Satan they'll put everything you can on
[48:28] you to think you've got to have the best
[48:29] of everything and you got to do
[48:30] everything everybody else is doing and
[48:32] that's just not true
[48:35] you are you and we love you for who you
[48:37] are doesn't matter what you have hello
[48:41] hey man amen I love it don't you
[48:44] so we want to look at it today and how
[48:47] that the whole earth is acting acting
[48:49] out of place we talked about 6cl opens
[48:52] with a great with a great earthquake in
[48:54] birth pains and what's with us going
[48:55] through and the storms my goodness said
[48:58] that have rocked this world the floods
[49:00] the the fires the hurricanes the the
[49:04] tornadoes the earthquakes and now
[49:05] volcanoes erupting just about everywhere
[49:10] around around the world just and that's
[49:13] the sixth seal coming the sixth seal is
[49:15] a tribulation and it opens with a great
[49:19] earthquake eden ow california could go
[49:23] we don't know any day
[49:26] it could happen but the bride is not
[49:29] focusing on the 60 the brides focusing
[49:35] on the Seventh Seal which is the coming
[49:38] of the Lord amen we talked about the
[49:42] mystery of God how that's Christ in you
[49:44] the hope of glory we talked about the
[49:46] fivefold ministry and their purpose to
[49:48] bring us to perfection we talked about
[49:50] adopting age and they placing those sons
[49:53] and daughters and talked about
[49:54] manifesting time and the whole whole
[49:56] creation is groaning in travail 2 for
[50:00] the sons of God to be manifested in
[50:03] saij that we're living in because it's
[50:04] manifesting time the fruit is on the
[50:06] vine the lovely the one is coming in
[50:08] plain view we're looking at these things
[50:11] today as we watch them we've read from
[50:13] jehovah-jireh we found out that he said
[50:16] now here he is among the church today
[50:19] made flashiest church he gave us the
[50:22] main over the earth and we ran an
[50:25] adoption part for he said for the
[50:26] manifestation of the sons of God when
[50:28] true sons born sons filled sons speak
[50:31] and their word is back say to this
[50:34] mountain brother I desire so and so I'm
[50:38] a believer in Jesus Christ and I give it
[50:41] to you in the name of the Lord Jesus
[50:42] Christ there's a manifestation he said
[50:46] Wow different than what we thought in
[50:48] Pentecost there's a manifestation I give
[50:52] it to you in the name of Jesus Christ
[50:54] I'm a son of God I'm a daughter of God I
[50:57] grant it to you
[50:59] well my crops are burning about I send
[51:01] you water in the name of the Lord bless
[51:03] your crops we talked about the 5
[51:06] manifestations of the third pole in
[51:08] brother branham's life talked about the
[51:10] storm on Colorado you remember we talked
[51:13] about the fish it got his life back we
[51:15] talked about the squirrels that were
[51:17] created we talked about Hattie right I
[51:20] can't spend a lot of time on this now
[51:21] because I got to go through the whole
[51:23] message here so I'm I'm trying to hurry
[51:24] long we talked about we talked about
[51:26] sister Hanny right when she said that's
[51:29] nothing but the truth about the
[51:30] Randleman and we talked about sister
[51:31] branham's tumor and how that it was
[51:33] healing we said it wasn't a bunch of hit
[51:35] and miss stuff going on but every time
[51:37] we said before brother Branham used the
[51:39] manifestation of that third Pole every
[51:41] time God spoke to him first and told him
[51:46] to speak so it's not a you know show
[51:51] it's not something just hit and miss
[51:53] that's going on there were that were
[51:55] they were trying to trying to do this
[51:56] God speaks and we answer he said here in
[51:59] the Perkins Church it said they they
[52:01] have thus saith the Lord or they keep
[52:03] still
[52:05] what is that maturity I didn't say they
[52:10] weren't bright if they kept still I just
[52:11] said they either have thus saith the
[52:13] Lord or they keep still why because
[52:14] they've learned all
[52:16] speak when he speaks you know that's
[52:20] when I get in trouble is when I talk and
[52:22] I shouldn't talk he told me to say it
[52:27] first thing that's your yea be yea and
[52:31] your nay nay not oh I could say things
[52:38] but I better not in a message why are we
[52:42] so tossed and I kind of added this in
[52:44] there he said and one day he entered
[52:48] into the temple and he picked up the
[52:50] scroll in red the Spirit of the Lord is
[52:53] upon me for it's anointed me to preach
[52:55] the acceptable year and to bind up the
[52:57] broken hearts of the heal the sick and
[52:59] give sight to the blind and now we would
[53:02] think if such an anointing was on him
[53:05] they'd been prophesied eight hundred
[53:07] years before that he would come and here
[53:10] is with that type of an anointing the
[53:13] full blessing an anointing of the Lord
[53:15] upon him we would want to run all over
[53:18] the building we'd want to scream and run
[53:20] a holler but the Bible said he laid down
[53:24] the scroll and he sat down remember it
[53:29] said the eyes of all them in the
[53:32] synagogue were fixed upon him he spoke
[53:36] for the rents they spoke these precious
[53:37] words this day this scripture is
[53:45] fulfilled in your ears identifying who
[53:48] he was and identifying the age that
[53:49] we're living in brother Branham said
[53:53] that's that's the precious words he said
[53:57] that's that's what he'd done under the
[53:59] anointing he didn't run scream shout
[54:03] listen God's not deaf you don't have to
[54:06] scream Devils out and the devil's not
[54:09] deaf either when that maniac up there in
[54:13] Washington come to tear brother ban him
[54:15] apart and it charged the platform
[54:17] brother Ram stopped the policeman and
[54:19] said let him come remember that come
[54:24] right up in front of him like he was
[54:25] going to beat and he did done it before
[54:26] the preachers he was gonna do it again
[54:28] brother
[54:29] just under his breath talked to him and
[54:30] said because you challenged a subtle god
[54:33] you're gonna fall at my feet nobody hurt
[54:36] hardly anybody ever heard that and a man
[54:39] went down boom you don't have to yell it
[54:42] you've got the authority according to
[54:46] the Word of God to speak the word in the
[54:53] Intervale preached up here in Sturgis
[54:56] Michigan 56 we learned that there were
[54:58] three courts the inner court and the
[55:02] outer court the inner court and the Holy
[55:03] of Holies and we learned that in the
[55:06] outer court the the firmament Sun the
[55:10] Moon the Stars that's what gave
[55:12] lightning on the another court and some
[55:14] days would be rainy some days would be
[55:15] cloudy some days the Sun would and shine
[55:17] that's a lot of people are there
[55:19] Christian Walker's right there they
[55:21] don't have any victory if it's not
[55:23] sunshine a little bit of rain and they
[55:26] just cloud up and want to cry themselves
[55:28] I think we've got enough rain I'd do a
[55:32] little crying I say how sorry about the
[55:33] head but but you know you you you you

[55:57] offered and then the seven golden
[55:58] candlesticks was there and that was an
[56:00] artificial light sometimes those lamps
[56:03] would get filmed over sometimes they
[56:04] they'd go out the wicks would go down
[56:06] somebody would have to come in the
[56:08] priests would have to community you have
[56:09] to fix them again and get them going
[56:11] again because of an artificial light
[56:13] that's why our experience is sometimes
[56:15] it's artificial if everything's burning
[56:17] good everything going great we're
[56:18] feeling good but get a little low and we
[56:20] get a little low and all of a sudden

[1:01:16] Jehovah God on earth as a fugitive a
[1:01:19] pilgrim in the land that he created
[1:01:21] rejected and pushed and laughed at
[1:01:23] scoffed at a stumbling stone to the
[1:01:26] unbeliever a rock of offense a devil to
[1:01:29] the righteous world but to the eternal
[1:01:31] sign to the believer God with us that's

[1:02:11] have come whatever he wished you but he
[1:02:13] chose to come as Abraham's seed amen
[1:02:17] Abraham super seed because they got what
[1:02:21] supernatural power supernatural signs
[1:02:24] with a supernatural belief in a
[1:02:27] supernatural word from a supernatural
[1:02:29] God you talk about super who is it whoa

[1:03:38] example when he was lost by his father
[1:03:41] and mother he looked about to find him
[1:03:42] and they found him in the temple What

[1:04:24] keep on keeping on and you keep serving
[1:04:26] God and you don't give up and you don't
[1:04:28] turn back and you don't run there's
[1:04:33] something super about you that's you're
[1:04:36] overcoming and you're doing doing it the
[1:04:39] right way
[1:04:44] so why next slide why do we suffer so
[1:04:52] why are we already feeted depressed
[1:04:57] rather fighting and laboring and working
[1:05:01] so hard to achieve it's because we're
[1:05:05] not resting Church we're not resting we
[1:05:11] need to walk into that holy place and
[1:05:12] let the curtains drop around us and the
[1:05:14] whole world seal you out the whole world
[1:05:19] on the outside you're living in this
[1:05:21] your kind of glory there's something
[1:05:23] going on inside that has never gone on
[1:05:26] before and you are feeling the presence
[1:05:28] of God in all the turmoil and all the
[1:05:31] Satan's Eden that he's got out there you
[1:05:34] are living a victorious life because
[1:05:36] Jesus Christ has come on the inside of
[1:05:38] you and baptize you with the Holy Ghost
[1:05:40] and the Spirit of the Living God is
[1:05:42] living inside of you hey man all right
[1:05:54] so what I want to say then is the Holy
[1:06:00] Ghost is our rest today it's not a
[1:06:05] Saturday or a Sunday Sabbath it's the
[1:06:09] Holy Ghost and I want to get into that
[1:06:11] because we're precious friends that are
[1:06:13] seventh-day adventists people that love
[1:06:16] us and we love them some of my grandkids
[1:06:18] have gone to seven Adventists school I
[1:06:21] have a granddaughter this teaching there
[1:06:23] now in their school there's some good
[1:06:26] people there and and they love the Lord
[1:06:29] some of them really do I've good people
[1:06:32] that are that are Jewish people
[1:06:35] Messianic Jews that believe in Christ
[1:06:38] and they're trying their best but
[1:06:40] they're still living under that Old
[1:06:44] Testament of sabbath-keeping
[1:06:49] being Saturday so I'm not you you do
[1:06:54] what you want to do let me just say this
[1:06:56] for the sake of the tape and who might
[1:06:57] hear it I'm not condemning that I'm just
[1:07:01] saying I want to share with you what I
[1:07:03] feel the scriptures say about it and
[1:07:05] about how that we need to move into a
[1:07:07] rest that'll bring rest to your soul not
[1:07:12] just the body because it's the inside
[1:07:16] that's the important part is that right
[1:07:18] we need rest for the body yeah I don't
[1:07:21] think there's anything wrong with taking
[1:07:22] a rest day I wish I could take a rest
[1:07:25] day and not have to worry about it
[1:07:27] you know you know what maybe you don't
[1:07:30] work on Saturday maybe Saturday is your
[1:07:32] day off but then there's that list
[1:07:36] there's that honey-do list for Saturday
[1:07:40] for you honey do this and hon do that
[1:07:44] and hon you this and do that so honey do
[1:07:46] list you thought you were gonna kick up
[1:07:49] feet up just rest but Saturday is okay
[1:07:53] Saturday won't work for you so we're
[1:07:55] doing on Sunday we do it Sunday Sunday
[1:07:56] can they arrest but you got to get up
[1:07:59] you get are you ready for church I've
[1:08:01] come to the house of God what you should
[1:08:03] do because we're on to the resurrection
[1:08:05] but then we get involved with everything
[1:08:07] else and so many other things we're
[1:08:08] fellowship and so on so it's cognitive
[1:08:09] this has got or your Monday nothing
[1:08:17] wrong with taking some rest we all could
[1:08:19] use rest because we get so busy in this
[1:08:23] crazy world but I want to talk about our
[1:08:25] real rest I want to talk about our real
[1:08:28] Sabbath if you don't mind and share some
[1:08:31] things from my heart and for the sake of
[1:08:33] the tape that I'm making here today as
[1:08:35] well as it is sharing with others so
[1:08:37] let's let's enter into this as we look
[1:08:40] at this today in Hebrews chapter 4 this
[1:08:46] is where we read the rest in him
[1:08:51] because he's our Sabbath so let's go
[1:08:53] back to our scripture now and just take
[1:08:56] a quick little look here I'm not a I'm
[1:08:58] not a teacher I'm not by any means a
[1:09:01] final voice on anything at all I just I
[1:09:04] like to take Scripture and bring it
[1:09:08] together and let it speak for itself I
[1:09:16] like to do that and then I like to bring
[1:09:20] the message dovetailing reading with it
[1:09:24] to show that it was backed by a prophet
[1:09:28] and it's tough saith the Lord because
[1:09:32] that's what the Word of God is so why
[1:09:36] aren't we so tossed why is your life in
[1:09:40] an uproar are we resting I think we get
[1:09:48] too busy I think we get too busy
[1:09:51] sometimes for the Lord how's your prayer
[1:09:54] life ouch you know I think we just get
[1:10:02] too busy Church we got to back up and
[1:10:05] take time and say Lord and forgive me he
[1:10:08] loves to talk to you he loves to sit
[1:10:11] with you he loves you know as a parent
[1:10:13] you love your children to come and just
[1:10:15] said talk it doesn't have to be deep
[1:10:20] subjects and deep conversations but just
[1:10:22] you know mom I really love you and I
[1:10:25] appreciate all your done mother just
[1:10:28] feels real good dad you're a fine
[1:10:32] example I appreciate you dad well son I
[1:10:35] appreciate you too you turned out pretty
[1:10:37] good thanks to your mom you know it's
[1:10:42] just taking time to talk to the father
[1:10:50] and I didn't speak back I longed for
[1:10:57] those times and we just don't do it
[1:11:01] enough I'm guilty we just don't do it
[1:11:05] enough because we get caught up in this
[1:11:07] rat race caught up in two things of the
[1:11:11] world that's going on but let me go
[1:11:12] through this I've got to I've got to
[1:11:14] read quick and you've got to listen fast
[1:11:17] all right I usually go about 220 miles
[1:11:23] an hour when I'm speaking in gust up to
[1:11:26] 440 so just listen
[1:11:28] I'll speak quick and you listen fast let
[1:11:32] us therefore fear you know to be afraid
[1:11:34] to besieged siege by alarm lest a
[1:11:39] promise being left us remember what he
[1:11:42] said the prompt for the promise is unto
[1:11:43] you and to your children and to all that
[1:11:45] our far-off events the minions the Lord
[1:11:47] I got your call what was that the Holy
[1:11:48] Ghost so let's be careful let's watch
[1:11:52] let's let's be a little alarmed by this
[1:11:54] that a promise being left us of the Holy
[1:11:57] Ghost of entering into his rest and that
[1:12:01] word rest there means a calming of the
[1:12:03] winds a resting place a heavenly
[1:12:06] blessing us to make quiet or just to
[1:12:09] rest
[1:12:11] that's what the holy ghost wants to do
[1:12:13] in your life wants to settle you so you
[1:12:16] stopped long enough to have this
[1:12:18] relationship and this atmosphere around
[1:12:21] you to where it doesn't matter what's
[1:12:25] going on out here you're at rest you're
[1:12:29] at peace your homes got order to it
[1:12:32] your family's standing together because
[1:12:37] we let everything come in and it just
[1:12:40] shakes all of that can you say Amen
[1:12:43] it really does it shakes all of us so
[1:12:47] watch what he says here for unto us was
[1:12:50] the gospel preached as well as under
[1:12:52] them but it did not profit them they
[1:12:55] didn't get anything out of it what it
[1:12:56] wasn't useful to him wasn't advantageous
[1:13:01] not being mixed with faith revelation
[1:13:04] they didn't have a revelation so they
[1:13:05] could understand heard the same word
[1:13:08] that we hear done that but they didn't
[1:13:10] have any understanding to it
[1:13:12] for a we which have believed to enter
[1:13:14] into rest we enter into rest as he has
[1:13:17] said as I swore to my wrath if they
[1:13:19] shall enter into my rest my rest he said
[1:13:22] although the works were finished from
[1:13:24] the foundation of the world I like that
[1:13:30] the Bible said he was a lamb slain from
[1:13:33] the foundation of the world it was all
[1:13:36] completed it was all done we just got to
[1:13:38] do our part we got to live our part of
[1:13:41] it amen
[1:13:42] can you say Amen for his sake in a
[1:13:45] certain place verse 4 for he spake in a
[1:13:47] certain place of the seventh day on this
[1:13:49] wife and God did rest the seventh day
[1:13:51] from all of his works and in this place
[1:13:53] again if they shall enter into my rest
[1:13:55] seeing therefore it remaineth that some
[1:13:57] of us enter in and they to whom it was
[1:13:59] first preached entered not in because of
[1:14:01] unbelief talking about the Jews and
[1:14:03] again he limited a certain day saying in
[1:14:05] David throughout the Psalms today after
[1:14:07] so long a time is it has said if they
[1:14:10] will hear my voice harden not your heart
[1:14:14] for if Jesus had given them rest if he
[1:14:16] to give him a day Saturday Sunday then
[1:14:19] would they not have afterwards spoken of
[1:14:21] another day there remaineth therefore a
[1:14:24] rest
[1:14:25] the people of God and for he that is
[1:14:28] entered into his rest his rest
[1:14:31] he keeps emphasizing that he also has
[1:14:34] ceased from his own works as God did
[1:14:36] from his amen
[1:14:40] talking more of just a 24-hour day rest
[1:14:43] entering into his rest ceasing from our
[1:14:46] labors let us therefore a labor to enter
[1:14:49] into that rest that is lest any man
[1:14:56] should seem to she'd fall after the same
[1:14:59] example of unbelief so let me just say
[1:15:03] something to the law and the
[1:15:05] commandments was only a shadow and a
[1:15:12] type of the real that's all the Old
[1:15:15] Testament was it was a shadow of the New
[1:15:17] Testament of what was going to come in
[1:15:20] yet people get so hung up on Old
[1:15:24] Testament teachings and laws and
[1:15:27] ordinances and and things in the little
[1:15:31] church in our in our area they love the
[1:15:34] bunch of people they're there because
[1:15:36] himself a Messianic Jew he's got a
[1:15:38] worldwide ministry he's a great orator
[1:15:41] great speaker great fella but he's he's
[1:15:44] into all the all all the ordinances all
[1:15:47] the old feast and all those things he
[1:15:50] wants to do them and still you know as a
[1:15:52] Christian talk about Christ which is
[1:15:55] which is okay I don't want to condemn
[1:15:57] that but friends we've been set free
[1:16:01] ordinances and all the things in the Old
[1:16:03] Testament they were they were nailed to
[1:16:05] the cross and let me just say it like
[1:16:08] this once Christ came that changed
[1:16:13] everything once he gave His life as a
[1:16:22] sacrificial lamb which was a type of
[1:16:26] that land back in the days when they
[1:16:28] Slade Slade the lamb and Slade the ox
[1:16:30] and if for the sins of the people now
[1:16:32] the real sacrificial lamb came and gave
[1:16:35] His life and were under a new covenant
[1:16:39] wonder new testament for a testament is
[1:16:43] only enforced after the death of the
[1:16:45] testator and now it's a new day so let's
[1:16:56] go Hebrews 7 and verse 19 said it like
[1:16:58] this for the law made nothing perfect
[1:17:02] but the bringing in of a better hope did
[1:17:06] by the which we draw nigh unto God
[1:17:12] Christ our land changed everything
[1:17:14] Church and if we're going to be
[1:17:17] believers of Christ we've got to believe
[1:17:19] what he did because we're still trying
[1:17:23] people are still trying to do it by
[1:17:25] works and it ain't gonna work if there's
[1:17:27] anything we can do to make ourself
[1:17:29] perfect then Christ died in vain hey man
[1:17:35] he was 10 verses 1 to 6 for the law
[1:17:39] having a shadow of good things to come
[1:17:42] and not the very image of the things can
[1:17:45] never with those sacrifices which they
[1:17:47] offered year by year continually make
[1:17:50] the comers thereunto perfect there's no
[1:17:52] perfection in the law you can keep it by
[1:17:57] the letter but there's no perfection in
[1:17:59] the law verse 2 said for then would they
[1:18:04] not have ceased to be offered if there
[1:18:06] had been perfection they wouldn't have
[1:18:08] to do it over and over and over and over
[1:18:09] and over and over and over and over
[1:18:11] because the worshiper once purged should
[1:18:15] have had no more conscience of sin but
[1:18:18] they did and every year they had to come
[1:18:20] back and do the same thing over again
[1:18:21] and over again but Christ died once for
[1:18:24] all think a minute
[1:18:28] I love it don't you verse 3 said but in
[1:18:33] those sacrifices there there is a
[1:18:36] remembrance again made every year for it
[1:18:39] is not possible that the blood of bulls
[1:18:41] and of goats should take away sins
[1:18:44] listen friends only Jesus can satisfy
[1:18:47] your soul
[1:18:48] there's nothing else is the answer to
[1:18:53] everything where for first five when he
[1:18:55] comes into the world he says sacrifice
[1:18:57] and offerings out what it's not but a
[1:18:59] body esta prepared me Who am I I'm
[1:19:02] coming as a sacrificial lamb I'm there's
[1:19:04] a body is given to be a sacrifice in
[1:19:08] other words he was born to die that was
[1:19:09] his purpose in coming he was born to
[1:19:12] give his life to you and I can have life
[1:19:15] in burnt offerings and sacrifices for
[1:19:18] sin thou has had no pleasure a man that
[1:19:23] didn't answer it
[1:19:24] listen we got good friends out here and
[1:19:27] I want to help him I want to just let
[1:19:29] him know you know why we're different we
[1:19:32] just differ I don't get it differ
[1:19:36] nothing wrong with that but the truth of
[1:19:39] the matter is if we're going to believe
[1:19:41] the Bible let's believe the Bible let's
[1:19:45] believe all it said I like to live by
[1:19:50] the Ten Commandments I'd like to do that
[1:19:54] God I can't keep them ain't good enough
[1:20:01] yeah well I bless God I'm a Ten
[1:20:05] Commandment well that's fine you ever
[1:20:08] lied
[1:20:14] well meaty tell him I'm not here
[1:20:27] see now Christ came and from that time
[1:20:36] on until now it's all about him are you
[1:20:40] listening to me friends it's all about
[1:20:42] him let's go to Colossians chapter 7
[1:20:46] chapter 2 I'm sorry
[1:20:48] Colossians chapter 2 verse 19 this is
[1:20:51] teaching I'm sorry I'm not shouting and
[1:20:53] running in the aisles I'm not sorry I'm
[1:20:55] not doing that I mean for your sake I
[1:20:56] mean I'm not I'm not walking the back of
[1:21:00] the Peters here today this is good stuff
[1:21:05] though you say man for in him dwelleth
[1:21:09] the fullness of the Godhead bodily in
[1:21:11] who in Christ the fullness of the
[1:21:14] Godhead bodily and we are complete in
[1:21:17] him oh wait a minute what about what
[1:21:20] about the ten commandments what about
[1:21:21] the law no we are complete in him we're
[1:21:26] completing him which is the head of all
[1:21:32] principality and power in whom also ye
[1:21:35] are circumcised with a circumcision made
[1:21:37] without hands in the putting off of the
[1:21:40] body of the sins of the flesh by the
[1:21:42] circumcision of Christ buried with him
[1:21:45] by baptism wherein also ye are risen
[1:21:48] with him through faith and the operation
[1:21:51] of God who has risen from the dead and
[1:21:53] you being dead in your and your sins and
[1:21:56] the uncircumcision of your flesh he hath
[1:21:58] quickened together with him having
[1:22:01] forgiven you all trespasses
[1:22:06] how many reckon that means all yeah I
[1:22:14] think it means all so who is gonna
[1:22:19] condemn me who's going to tell me that
[1:22:23] I've got trespasses going on
[1:22:25] no he forgave me all my trespasses
[1:22:28] doesn't matter what the devil says
[1:22:30] doesn't matter what the accuser says I'm
[1:22:33] sorry he's forgiven me all yeah but you
[1:22:34] don't keep Saturday I know I don't keep
[1:22:36] Saturday I don't keep Sunday either like
[1:22:38] I should but I'll tell you why I go to
[1:22:40] church
[1:22:41] a little bit it's not about a day it's
[1:22:45] about him it's about the Holy Ghost of
[1:22:48] being filled with the Holy Ghost and him
[1:22:50] giving you rest for your soul here's the
[1:22:54] answer it's all about him Church first
[1:23:03] word was I at what verse 13 okay verse
[1:23:07] 14 blotting out the handwriting of
[1:23:10] Ordinances oh my that was against us
[1:23:16] people think the law is a wonderful
[1:23:17] thing it wasn't for a wonderful thing
[1:23:19] I'll explain to you why it was given
[1:23:22] here in a little bit and that that it's
[1:23:24] not to be observed now it's over
[1:23:26] whew that's pretty good statement okay
[1:23:29] let's just let the word say it okay
[1:23:30] sorry
[1:23:31] blotting out the handwriting or nurses
[1:23:33] that was against us which was contrary
[1:23:35] to us and took us out of the way nailing
[1:23:38] it to the cross and having spoiled
[1:23:42] principalities and powers made a show of
[1:23:44] them openly triumphing over them in it
[1:23:47] let no man therefore judge you in meat
[1:23:50] or in drink or in respect of hot and
[1:23:54] holiday or of a new moon or of a Sabbath
[1:23:58] days let no man judge you because the
[1:24:07] teaching a lot of it folks in the
[1:24:10] seventh day if you don't keep Saturday
[1:24:12] then then that's that's the important
[1:24:15] about sin almost that's you're not going
[1:24:17] to make it that's a seal the seventh day
[1:24:18] Saturday to them keeping the Saturday
[1:24:20] then is is is is a seal of God is what
[1:24:23] they say but that's not true the seal of
[1:24:28] God is the Holy Ghost
[1:24:33] and I don't it's fine if people want to
[1:24:36] worship on Saturday I don't have a
[1:24:38] problem with that thank God their
[1:24:39] worship and they want to worship every
[1:24:41] day amen
[1:24:45] so he said that let no man judge you a
[1:24:48] meat and drink respect to a holiday or a
[1:24:50] new moon or over Saturdays which are a
[1:24:53] shadow of things to come but the body is
[1:24:57] of Christ the shadow they're an image
[1:25:07] that's what a shadow is this an image of
[1:25:09] the real it's not the real you could
[1:25:14] come up to get me want to just hurt me
[1:25:17] and destroy me in see me walking down
[1:25:20] the street and they're my shadow going
[1:25:21] along there you could do whatever you
[1:25:23] want my shadow you could stab it and
[1:25:27] beat it and shoot it and kill it but are
[1:25:29] you gonna die cause it's only a shadow
[1:25:34] it's not too real it's a shadow of what
[1:25:39] was coming it's not the real image it's
[1:25:44] the shadow of the real image amen and
[1:25:48] you know when the real shows up the
[1:25:50] shadows gone who wants to talk to a
[1:25:54] shadow
[1:25:57] oh hey watch now that's bless your heart
[1:26:01] Galatians chapter 3
[1:26:03] halation chapter 3 Christ has redeemed
[1:26:06] us from the curse of the law that
[1:26:11] curtain where curse means doomed doomed
[1:26:18] that's what the law did it doom people
[1:26:22] Christ has redeemed us from the curse of
[1:26:27] the law being made a curse for us as
[1:26:29] written cursed is every one that hangeth
[1:26:31] on a tree that the blessings of Abraham
[1:26:33] might come on the Gentiles through Jesus
[1:26:35] Christ that we might receive the promise
[1:26:38] of the Spirit through faith
[1:26:44] you see the dispensations changed when
[1:26:48] Jesus Christ came to dispensations
[1:26:50] changed it had changed from the law and
[1:26:52] all the ordinances and all the rituals
[1:26:54] and all the Jews had done for all those
[1:26:56] thousands of years it had changed now to
[1:26:59] a body to a young Jewish boy walking in
[1:27:06] shoe leather and they couldn't handle it
[1:27:16] and yet that body that young man stood
[1:27:19] there one day and he said except you
[1:27:22] believe that I am he you're gonna die in
[1:27:28] your sins this is tough stuff this is
[1:27:33] real stuff this is a baby talk this is
[1:27:38] real meat this is straight talk if
[1:27:44] you're not accepting Jesus Christ and
[1:27:47] you've got a problem and the problems in
[1:27:50] your heart all right can I continue yes
[1:27:57] I can thank you where is that what verse
[1:28:01] verse 19 wherefore then serveth the law
[1:28:07] what was the purpose why did it all come
[1:28:10] it was added because of transmission
[1:28:15] they couldn't live right they couldn't
[1:28:17] do things right their innocence he was
[1:28:21] gone in the garden they didn't make it
[1:28:24] under human government in those days so
[1:28:26] God sent the law because of all their
[1:28:29] transgressions it wasn't a good thing
[1:28:34] but it was something he had to sin to
[1:28:36] bring him in check for the things that
[1:28:40] were doing wrong well we have something
[1:28:43] that brings us back in check today it's
[1:28:45] called the holy spirit that'll check you
[1:28:49] and watch you and keep you day by day in
[1:28:52] your walk with God I love him don't you
[1:28:58] church we're for service the law ed
[1:29:02] because your transgressions till until
[1:29:04] the seed should come to whom the promise
[1:29:07] was made and it was ordained by angels
[1:29:10] in the hand of a mediator between God
[1:29:15] and man
[1:29:18] 4:21 said is the law then against the
[1:29:21] promise of god god forbid for if there
[1:29:24] had been a law given that could have
[1:29:26] given life verily righteousness should
[1:29:29] have been by the law but before faith
[1:29:33] came before faith came we were kept
[1:29:40] under the law shut up unto the faith
[1:29:44] which should afterwards be revealed
[1:29:50] wherefore the law was a schoolmaster
[1:29:53] oh my you know a school masters are
[1:29:57] their little tough dudes the classroom
[1:30:01] they keep you in line we had one like I
[1:30:06] forgot her name no goodness sakes I
[1:30:08] thought I'd never forget her name I
[1:30:10] think it was mrs. I think was mrs. bath
[1:30:13] she was anything but a bath but if you
[1:30:17] are paying attention and you had your
[1:30:20] head down and you had your hand anywhere
[1:30:23] she could get to it she had a ruler she
[1:30:26] carried around the classroom and she
[1:30:29] would go Shrek
[1:30:30] oh and she didn't care that she was a
[1:30:37] schoolmaster she was a test master she
[1:30:44] was a jailer she was a tyrant she was a
[1:30:47] warden she was a good teacher the law
[1:30:54] here's what the law was don't get so
[1:30:58] hung up on the law it wasn't the real
[1:31:02] thing it was given it's a schoolmaster
[1:31:06] wherefore the law was a schoolmaster to
[1:31:08] bring us unto Christ which we might be
[1:31:15] justified by faith that we might be
[1:31:17] justified by faith but after faith come
[1:31:20] we are no longer under
[1:31:26] master we're graduated some of us quit
[1:31:35] you ate it I didn't put some yes but we
[1:31:38] graduated we're on school why do you
[1:31:41] need a schoolmaster now that you're out
[1:31:43] of school you don't need somebody to
[1:31:46] crack your knuckles but yet God gives us
[1:31:50] leadership of the Holy Spirit that says
[1:31:56] wait a minute you shouldn't do that
[1:31:59] what was that thought to her thinking
[1:32:01] you better watch that better change that
[1:32:04] you better not go there
[1:32:06] we're still under leadership we've still
[1:32:11] got guidance but now it's the Holy
[1:32:13] Spirit and it's guided by love is guided
[1:32:17] by by the presence of God and in the
[1:32:20] will of God and I don't have any idea
[1:32:22] where their what I did with my eyes okay
[1:32:25] let me look here where am I at guys what
[1:32:27] am i reading from do you know well where
[1:32:29] for Orpha but after about their faith
[1:32:31] has come then we are no longer under a
[1:32:33] schoolmaster were set free from the law
[1:32:37] that's plain isn't it it is to me maybe
[1:32:41] I'm not seeing something but I I want to
[1:32:44] second Corinthians 3 second twenty three
[1:32:46] but if the administration of death now
[1:32:49] that's the law the administration
[1:32:51] administration of death written and
[1:32:55] engraved in stones what was written and
[1:32:57] engraven stones the Ten Commandments is
[1:32:59] that right if the administration of
[1:33:02] death written and engraven in stones was
[1:33:04] glorious so that the children really
[1:33:06] could not said vastly look about the
[1:33:07] finished of Moses for the glory of his
[1:33:09] countenance which glory was to be done
[1:33:11] away how shall not the ministration of
[1:33:15] the Spirit the Holy Ghost be rather
[1:33:17] glorious more perfect more glorious
[1:33:22] if the administration of condemnation
[1:33:24] law be glory much more the ministration
[1:33:27] of righteousness Christ exceeding glory
[1:33:30] for then that which was made glorious
[1:33:32] had no glory in the respect by reason of
[1:33:35] the glory that Excellus for if that
[1:33:38] which has done away was glorious
[1:33:40] much more that was remaineth is glorious
[1:33:44] seeing then that we have such a hope we
[1:33:48] use great plainness plainness of speech
[1:33:52] not as Moses which would have a low risk
[1:33:54] face then the children of Israel could
[1:33:56] not steadfastly look to the end which is
[1:33:59] abolished but their minds were blinded
[1:34:02] for until the day this day remain as the
[1:34:07] same veil on taken away at the reading
[1:34:09] of the Old Testament the veil which veil
[1:34:13] is done away in Christ he changed it
[1:34:17] altered if you're still living under Old
[1:34:22] Testament law you haven't accepted
[1:34:25] Christ as your sacrifice as your lamb as
[1:34:30] your deliverance as a better thing we
[1:34:37] had the law but we were hoping something
[1:34:39] better would come along and God knew it
[1:34:43] would because he was a lamb slain from
[1:34:44] the foundation of the world this was all
[1:34:46] in his plan it was his plan for Israel
[1:34:49] to go through this he was his plan for
[1:34:51] the fall he was the plan for redemption
[1:34:53] it was a plan for Christ to come
[1:34:55] he was the plan for the Holy Ghost to be
[1:34:56] given it's a plan for you to be sitting
[1:34:58] here today in the anointing of God he
[1:35:02] had a plan he said but even until this
[1:35:06] day when Moses is read the Vedas upon
[1:35:08] their heart verse 15 verse 16
[1:35:09] nevertheless when it the heart shall
[1:35:11] turn to the Lord the veil shall be taken
[1:35:15] away the law will go and Grace will come
[1:35:20] and then you're free
[1:35:23] you're free Paul said the Apostle Paul
[1:35:29] says all things are lawful unto me but I
[1:35:33] won't be a brought into bondage of any
[1:35:35] of it
[1:35:35] all things are lawful but all things are
[1:35:38] not expedient I'm free
[1:35:47] Christ has set me free he who the Sun
[1:35:50] sets free is what friend heed you're not
[1:35:53] bound to keep things
[1:36:04] look at when Christ came when Jesus came
[1:36:08] memory said he said when he came he said
[1:36:10] I'm not coming to destroy the law but I
[1:36:12] come from a fillip member he said that
[1:36:13] he was a field fulfilling of the law we
[1:36:17] came to this earth
[1:36:25] he magnified the law that's the way I
[1:36:27] want to say it I can say it changed it
[1:36:30] because he did change it but he
[1:36:31] magnified it this is where he says in
[1:36:35] Matthew 5:27 28 Matthew 5:27 28 but she
[1:36:40] have heard that it had been said by them
[1:36:43] of old thou shalt not commit adultery
[1:36:45] but I say any who so ever look at upon a
[1:36:49] woman to lust after her has committed
[1:36:50] adultery with her already in his heart
[1:36:54] what did you he magnified it though the
[1:36:57] law said thou should not commit adultery
[1:36:59] but it stopped there it was a physical
[1:37:01] act but now Jesus brings it over and
[1:37:04] said this is a condition of the heart to
[1:37:07] lust after her already in his heart
[1:37:12] there's an adult right now so he main
[1:37:16] defined look what he said he goes on
[1:37:17] here in same chapter verse 22 21 22 look
[1:37:21] what he says here you have heard that
[1:37:22] have been said of them of them all thou
[1:37:24] shalt not kill
[1:37:25] but whosoever shall kill shall be in
[1:37:27] danger of the judgment but I've said
[1:37:28] unto you whosoever is angry with his
[1:37:30] brother without a cause this in danger
[1:37:32] of the judgment that were anger looked
[1:37:34] our word up anger anger one time anger
[1:37:37] is a struck it means it means a strong
[1:37:40] hateful hating strong hey who sever
[1:37:44] strongly hates another the same as a
[1:37:49] murdering spirit killing spirit what did
[1:37:55] he do he magnified it but I see a new
[1:37:57] whosoever is angry with his brother
[1:37:58] without a cause shall be in danger of
[1:38:00] the judgment whosoever shall say to his
[1:38:01] brother Rick and the only taxation I
[1:38:03] could come up with modern was idiot
[1:38:05] don't call your brother an idiot he may
[1:38:08] be one we're gonna call him man which be
[1:38:12] in she'll be in danger the consequence
[1:38:14] never say thou fool shall be in danger
[1:38:16] of the Hellfire you don't call your
[1:38:18] brother a fool your brother's not a fool
[1:38:20] you may do foolish things but he's not a
[1:38:22] fool because The Fool has said in his
[1:38:23] heart there is no God
[1:38:25] that's a fool a man
[1:38:31] so what is the real rest what is the
[1:38:33] real thing here then can I go just a
[1:38:35] little bit longer okay I'm not preaching
[1:38:42] I'm trying to teach a little bit all
[1:38:47] right let's look here Matthew 11
[1:38:51] beginning in verse 28 let's look at the
[1:38:55] real rest now come unto me all you that
[1:38:57] labor and heavy laden and I will give
[1:39:00] you rest another word for rest of
[1:39:01] Sabbath in other words that I looked at
[1:39:06] that rest it means to cause the cease
[1:39:08] from labor to recover to collect to draw
[1:39:14] strength to refresh to keep quiet and
[1:39:18] calm take my yoke upon you and learn of
[1:39:22] me for I am meek and lowly in heart and
[1:39:24] you shall find rest unto your soul rest
[1:39:31] unto your souls for my yoke is easy and
[1:39:35] my burden is light it's not a
[1:39:40] schoolmaster
[1:39:44] it's not a hard thing it's a joyous
[1:39:48] thing I'd be kidding you on a little
[1:39:51] further here Romans chapter 13
[1:39:53] let me look he with me beginning
[1:39:56] conversatio low man anything but to love
[1:39:58] one another for he that loveth another
[1:40:00] hath fulfilled it's a law what what love
[1:40:10] fulfills a lot Wow
[1:40:14] for this first night thou shalt not
[1:40:18] commit adultery thou shall not kill thou
[1:40:19] shalt not steal what is that that's the
[1:40:20] law then commander thou shalt not bear
[1:40:22] false witness thou shalt not covet and
[1:40:24] if there be any other commandment it is
[1:40:27] briefly comprehended in to this saying
[1:40:29] thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
[1:40:31] love worketh no ill to his neighbor
[1:40:33] therefore love is the fulfilling of the
[1:40:36] law it fulfills it all right so he goes
[1:40:47] on now Isaiah Isaiah brought it out in
[1:40:51] Isaiah 28 you know what we're getting to
[1:40:55] the rest for precept must be upon
[1:40:57] precept precept upon precept line upon
[1:40:59] line line upon line here a little there
[1:41:00] little for with stammering lips and
[1:41:02] another tongue will I speak under those
[1:41:04] people for whom he said this is the rest
[1:41:06] this is the rest this is the rest where
[1:41:08] anybody cause the weary to rest then
[1:41:10] this is the refreshing yet they would
[1:41:12] not hear they won't accept it wondering
[1:41:16] except the Jews would not accept the
[1:41:18] Holy Ghost they would not accept the day
[1:41:19] of Pentecost they would not accept
[1:41:21] Christ coming
[1:41:26] because for them to have done that would
[1:41:30] have undone all that that they had done
[1:41:34] for years not realizing that was just
[1:41:38] there until this came this is the real
[1:41:42] deal
[1:41:44] Christ superseded everything modern term
[1:41:52] he trumped everything he was the real
[1:42:00] deal
[1:42:07] all right so the Holy Ghost is our rest
[1:42:10] today
[1:42:11] acts 2 I'm not gonna read this I'm not
[1:42:13] gonna read this next that's cool because
[1:42:15] you know it the day of Pentecost when
[1:42:17] the day of Pentecost was fully come here
[1:42:18] in the upper row remember and they and
[1:42:19] they spoke with tongues as the Spirit
[1:42:20] gave them utterance I'm not gonna read
[1:42:22] that one so why do we gather on Sunday
[1:42:24] then why are we different than the
[1:42:29] seventh-day Adventists and in the Jewish
[1:42:31] faith why do we gather on Sunday and not
[1:42:35] on Saturday well two reasons that I can
[1:42:39] say it's off the top of my head number
[1:42:44] one reason is to is to honor the
[1:42:45] resurrection
[1:42:48] once Christ came and rose on the first
[1:42:52] day then Christians honor the
[1:42:57] resurrection of Christ and so we meet on
[1:43:01] Sunday for that purpose Luke chapter 24
[1:43:05] verses 1 to 3 Luke 24 verses 1 to 3 now
[1:43:10] upon the first day of the week very
[1:43:12] early in the morning they came unto the
[1:43:14] sepulchre bringing the spices which they
[1:43:16] had prepared and certain others with
[1:43:18] them and they found the stone rolled
[1:43:20] away from the sepulchre and they entered
[1:43:22] into the fowl not the body of Christ
[1:43:23] I'll not the body of our Lord Jesus he
[1:43:26] is not here verse 6 he is not here but
[1:43:28] he is risen
[1:43:29] remember how he spake unto them when
[1:43:32] they were yet in Galilee he is not here
[1:43:35] he has risen the second reason we meet
[1:43:37] on Sundays because all the early church
[1:43:39] met on Sunday all the Apostles all the
[1:43:43] disciples they all met on Sunday
[1:43:48] Acts chapter 20 verse 7 back to chapter
[1:43:51] 20 verse 7 and upon the first day of the
[1:43:54] week when the disciples came together to
[1:43:56] break bread Paul preached unto them and
[1:44:01] continued his speech until midnight
[1:44:03] 1st Corinthians 16 one and two all right
[1:44:06] can I just finish this now please I'm
[1:44:10] doing real good
[1:44:11] time-wise it just seems like it's longer
[1:44:14] because I'm not walking the aisles but I
[1:44:19] want to lay this in here and what this
[1:44:20] is good solid teaching because I love I
[1:44:24] love people I love the folks that we
[1:44:28] know that our friends of ours in the
[1:44:31] 7-day administers they're good friends
[1:44:33] and they love our family we love them
[1:44:36] and and a precious friend Sherry's got a
[1:44:39] landlady this of Messianic Jew she's a
[1:44:41] precious lady I wouldn't want to hurt
[1:44:44] them for anything in the world but
[1:44:45] there's truth is truth whether it's for
[1:44:48] me or whether it's for anybody out the
[1:44:50] truth is truth and I want people to know
[1:44:52] the truth
[1:44:54] so I speak it from my heart first within
[1:44:59] 16 verse 1 now concerning the collection
[1:45:02] of the Saints as the offerings the tithe
[1:45:08] said I this is Paul as I have given
[1:45:14] order to the churches of Galatia as I
[1:45:19] whose thing is it was Paul think he is
[1:45:25] this that they're gonna come on the
[1:45:26] first day of the week dictate the
[1:45:29] collection what about Saturday
[1:45:32] who was Paul well he only wrote 14 books
[1:45:37] of the New Testament he only said except
[1:45:42] you were if an you were an angel from
[1:45:44] heaven or an angel from heaven come
[1:45:46] preaching any other gospel than what I
[1:45:48] preached unto you let him be accursed
[1:45:50] whoa
[1:45:53] this guy's got some macho body this is
[1:45:58] the real deal here
[1:46:00] amen amen
[1:46:07] now
[1:46:13] so concerning the collections of the
[1:46:14] Saints as I have given you order to the
[1:46:18] churches of Galilee even so do ye upon
[1:46:21] the first day of the week that every one
[1:46:24] of you by lay by him in store as God has
[1:46:28] prospered him that there be no
[1:46:31] gatherings when I come day your ties 10%
[1:46:38] you give listen if you're not doing that
[1:46:42] then you're not you're not fulfilling
[1:46:44] the the word of the Lord you know
[1:46:51] because that that 10% of what you earn
[1:46:54] is not yours that's the Lord's it's not
[1:46:59] brother Sam's that's the Lord's we paid
[1:47:02] into the storehouse of the law of the
[1:47:04] Lord in God has a man there to take care
[1:47:06] of it
[1:47:07] he has a ministry there has a Levite
[1:47:10] there that takes care that the Lord's
[1:47:12] money hello
[1:47:15] if trustees that take care of of the
[1:47:18] building and the things that go on with
[1:47:19] the funds that come in to to support the
[1:47:21] church so we're not doing that then
[1:47:25] we're not doing the law we're going to
[1:47:26] do the word either as it is spoken here
[1:47:29] so the Sabbath I love this little
[1:47:32] statement the Sabbath actually was made
[1:47:35] for man and not man made for the Sabbath
[1:47:40] we should be held under bondage
[1:47:44] by the Sabbath because we're free
[1:47:50] all right look at mark - mark - there's
[1:47:54] 23 mark 2 verse 23 are you with me can I
[1:47:56] go do something I know I can I had quit
[1:47:59] CNN mark 2 verse 23 fur came to pass
[1:48:04] that he went through the cornfields on
[1:48:06] the Sabbath day and his disciples begin
[1:48:08] as they went to pluck the ears of corn
[1:48:10] on a Sabbath day and the Pharisees said
[1:48:12] behold why do they on the Sabbath day
[1:48:15] that which is unlawful it's not lawful
[1:48:17] to do that any centre to them have you
[1:48:20] never read what David did when he had
[1:48:23] need and they were hungered he and them
[1:48:26] that with him
[1:48:26] how do they win into the house of God in
[1:48:29] the days of the abbot are the high
[1:48:31] priests and did eat the shewbread which
[1:48:33] he is not lawful to eat but for the
[1:48:35] priests and he gave also unto them that
[1:48:38] were with him and he said unto them the
[1:48:40] Sabbath was made for man and not man for
[1:48:45] it's therefore a blessing that occurs
[1:48:48] people make it a curse if you don't keep
[1:48:50] it your gun no that's not why was there
[1:48:55] was there to help you that's what the
[1:48:59] Holy Spirit is there for the Son of Man
[1:49:03] is Lord also of the Sabbath 1st
[1:49:11] Corinthians chapter 6 verse 12 and 13
[1:49:16] Paul said all things are lawful unto me
[1:49:18] but all things are not expedient all
[1:49:19] things are lawful with me but I would
[1:49:20] not be running the power of any all
[1:49:22] things are lawful unto me but all things
[1:49:24] are not expanding all things are lawful
[1:49:25] unto me but all things edify it not now
[1:49:28] I'm not gonna elaborate there's a lot
[1:49:30] more scriptures that we could bring here
[1:49:31] of teaching that Paul talked about the
[1:49:33] things sacrificed to idols and all these
[1:49:35] things and he said we're free we're free
[1:49:37] from all that but don't use your Liberty
[1:49:42] as an offence
[1:49:47] you respect people respect but don't
[1:49:51] flaunt your liberties
[1:49:53] don't say haha I don't have to do it no
[1:49:56] have the right spirit be careful how you
[1:50:00] present things you know something I've
[1:50:03] even heard people say well you don't
[1:50:05] want to talk to them they they rejected
[1:50:07] the message years ago maybe they didn't
[1:50:09] maybe they rejected how it was presented
[1:50:14] hello
[1:50:16] maybe that's the problem not not the
[1:50:18] message but how its presented because
[1:50:21] sometimes people get pretty rough with
[1:50:23] it people made it no I'm not gonna you
[1:50:29] know I'm not gonna say there's not
[1:50:31] problems problem children I would say
[1:50:33] that way they come along well that
[1:50:38] church over there you don't go to that
[1:50:39] church they got no ain't no different we
[1:50:42] got to people are people there are
[1:50:45] humans are humans everywhere that's
[1:50:51] another subject all right
[1:50:55] first Corinthians 6:12 all things are
[1:51:01] lawful but all things are not explained
[1:51:03] all things lawful I'm sorry all things
[1:51:05] broad okay first Corinthians 10 in 2003
[1:51:08] did I read all that already I read all
[1:51:10] that already alright let's go I'm gonna
[1:51:13] I'm gonna close with this part here I
[1:51:15] think so I want to look at brother
[1:51:21] branham's convictions about Sunday
[1:51:24] because I I really I'm going to say from
[1:51:26] my heart too I think sometimes we we
[1:51:29] forget that it should be a we should
[1:51:33] honor the resurrection not just not just
[1:51:36] from 11:00 to 1:00
[1:51:41] stepping out of my authority here
[1:51:43] brother Sam's gonna have to really
[1:51:45] really get me when he gets back but this
[1:51:48] is me I feel like we we shouldn't just
[1:51:51] honor the resurrection on Sunday morning
[1:51:55] when we're in service but I think we're
[1:51:58] too easy to get lacks with the rest of
[1:52:01] the day and get going do things that
[1:52:03] perhaps we shouldn't be doing
[1:52:07] take a rest day take a day talk to your
[1:52:11] children be a family fellowship with
[1:52:14] people but don't just turn it into
[1:52:17] another day that's me now and brother
[1:52:22] branham he had kind of had a conviction
[1:52:23] about him so I'm gonna read here from
[1:52:25] questions and answers number two this is
[1:52:30] co D 1964 and I'm just gonna read you
[1:52:36] listen as I read this now you say
[1:52:40] brother Branham you hunt didn't you ever
[1:52:44] hunt on Sunday well let me tell you
[1:52:47] something I'm not patting myself on the
[1:52:49] back here with of this but I'm not a
[1:52:52] sabbatarian now I believe the Holy
[1:52:54] Spirit is our Sabbath I believe that I
[1:52:57] believe we should honor that
[1:53:00] resurrection as a memorial
[1:53:02] that's a memorial that if you honor any
[1:53:06] day honor the resurrection now there's a
[1:53:10] no no law on keeping any certain day
[1:53:12] because you enter into the Sabbath of
[1:53:14] peace when you enter into him I've got
[1:53:18] that question here that I'm going to
[1:53:19] answer pretty soon anyhow if the Lord
[1:53:22] willing and about what the Sabbath day
[1:53:25] and I'll explain it God willing
[1:53:27] and now notice remember this see when I
[1:53:29] was a little boy right up here in Utica
[1:53:32] you I can't even cross that Youkilis I
[1:53:36] don't know what it is live down on the
[1:53:38] road I was about 14 years old I wasn't
[1:53:40] rapping for a living the only thing I
[1:53:43] had to help to get bread in our house it
[1:53:47] was catching skunks muskrats and possums
[1:53:50] I loved trapping
[1:53:52] I had to do it I go to school smelling
[1:53:55] like a skunk I had only one pair of
[1:53:58] clothes and that's all I had could wear
[1:54:00] and that's all I had mom would take it
[1:54:02] and wore some worth them often and
[1:54:05] washed them and put them back on and now
[1:54:08] that's how I went to school little boy I
[1:54:11] was standing right up there one night I
[1:54:15] said I I got them traps set out there
[1:54:18] around waffles up above that I leave
[1:54:22] every morning about two o'clock in the
[1:54:24] morning with my lanterns I'd run those
[1:54:26] traps and then get back here in time to
[1:54:28] go to school I catch a rabbit I got 15
[1:54:31] cents out of it I get a box of shells
[1:54:33] out of that and maybe kill two three or
[1:54:35] four rabbits that what we didn't have to
[1:54:39] to make some biscuits and rabbits why
[1:54:42] the gravy for supper I've sell the
[1:54:44] others and maybe get enough to to get
[1:54:46] some bread or some meal some flour to
[1:54:48] make gravy I didn't know what whether
[1:54:51] you had that light like that or not I'd
[1:54:53] set it trout lines on the river and go
[1:54:56] down there and get them fish and sell it
[1:54:57] for ten cents a pound set my trout lines
[1:55:00] and I didn't have no boat I'd swim out
[1:55:03] to the log get in the water river and
[1:55:06] still cold and put my bucket and I'm
[1:55:13] gonna have to read over here get on to
[1:55:15] the river and put my bucket a bait in
[1:55:18] there out there in the log and paddle
[1:55:20] and paddle like that and my naked body
[1:55:22] in the river in run and had me a string
[1:55:25] on the side tie my fish up see them old
[1:55:28] catfish fitting me in the legs going
[1:55:31] along they're like you know what catfish
[1:55:33] fitting is yeah hey man no calf it's got
[1:55:38] fins no stick them in you if they get
[1:55:41] close to him
[1:55:41] okay keep going next slide but look a
[1:55:45] mini at night when I had was out then
[1:55:47] that river eleven o'clock but look a
[1:55:51] Midianite I went out in that River at
[1:55:53] eleven o'clock and shake every bit of
[1:55:56] bait off that line if I couldn't catch
[1:55:59] enough in six days I didn't want the one
[1:56:03] that come on the seventh
[1:56:05] stood there in the rain one night I came
[1:56:08] just seeing myself yet standing there
[1:56:10] leaning against I was a sinner but I was
[1:56:13] standing leaning against the pole like
[1:56:15] this the door it was pouring down rain
[1:56:17] and pretty near eleven o'clock and I'd
[1:56:20] be late tonight but I'm going to spring
[1:56:22] every one of those traps I won't catch
[1:56:26] them on the Sabbath i said i won't i
[1:56:28] won't set them traps god honors that go
[1:56:31] ahead and do also do you teach that we
[1:56:36] must we must need not keep sunday or any
[1:56:40] whole holy day or working or like
[1:56:44] working and fishing on sunday i believe
[1:56:48] yours for the brand now i believe it's a
[1:56:50] sin to hunt to fish and hunt and work on
[1:56:55] sunday when you can go to church and i
[1:56:59] believe you're transgressing the laws of
[1:57:01] god if there's a commandment to session
[1:57:04] yes sir
[1:57:05] there is now in the old testament we had
[1:57:08] the type of the sabbath day is all right
[1:57:10] and then jesus did not come for you to
[1:57:13] keep the sabbath day days the old
[1:57:17] sabbath day was Saturday which was the
[1:57:19] end of the week sunday is the eighth day
[1:57:21] the first day of the week with Jesus
[1:57:23] rose on I do not believe it's right now
[1:57:26] if you're a way in a wilderness
[1:57:28] somewhere and you're out there and
[1:57:30] hunting trip and there's no church
[1:57:31] around you think like that and there's
[1:57:33] nothing you can do and if you're fishing
[1:57:35] I believe that would be all right and if
[1:57:37] you around in the city or around in the
[1:57:39] church is going on you should attend
[1:57:42] church you should attend church now that
[1:57:52] was further Brandon's convictions so
[1:58:00] what do you saying by the time I'm
[1:58:03] saying we need to know our word we need
[1:58:08] to believe it we need to stand on it
[1:58:13] when did drawing I had to him you know
[1:58:15] he's done so much for us
[1:58:20] now I got about 14 pages maybe not quite
[1:58:26] that many but almost left of just two
[1:58:32] places for the Rams answering that
[1:58:34] question on the Sabbath day not gonna
[1:58:36] read every day I'd you liked but it was
[1:58:46] it's important enough for me to say this
[1:58:51] we need to take check where we are in
[1:58:56] our spiritual walk with God because I
[1:59:01] got to tell you this morning he loves
[1:59:02] you he loves you above and beyond
[1:59:07] anything you could comprehend and he's
[1:59:11] done so much for you he's given so much
[1:59:16] to you and you really need and I really
[1:59:24] need to let him know how thankful I am
[1:59:29] for truth because you shall know the
[1:59:34] truth and the truth shall make you free
[1:59:40] I'm glad I'm glad I'm not under law I'm
[1:59:45] good cuz under the law there were so
[1:59:48] many things I mean my mind just can't
[1:59:52] comprehend all the things over there and
[1:59:56] just to know that he came to set us free
[2:00:01] I'm thankful you have been a great
[2:00:05] audience
