[47:29] that's so good to us isn't he
[47:32] and I which reminds you of the communion
[47:36] service next week next Sunday and um
[47:39] just to be in prayer and keep that in
[47:42] mind as well
[47:43] I also want to
[47:45] say here this morning we certainly want
[47:47] to welcome the
[47:49] Aaron Basics here with us and from there
[47:52] from brother Nathan Bryant's assembly
[47:53] there in Indiana and uh just just good
[47:56] friends and they came to spend some time
[47:59] with us this weekend so that means a lot
[48:02] amen and so we so enjoyed the fellowship
[48:05] that we've had with him here throughout
[48:08] yesterday and then the opportunity for
[48:10] them to be here with us and it's just
[48:12] been a real privilege to get to meet
[48:15] them and to know them from the times
[48:17] when we our paths at crossword brother
[48:20] Nathan and uh just it's just wonderful
[48:23] how God brings friends in your life
[48:25] isn't it
[48:26] you know I say this often and uh you
[48:28] know sometimes we I can if you wasn't
[48:32] like this as a young person will you
[48:33] forgive me and Overlook it you know but
[48:35] you know sometimes as a young person and
[48:37] things and sometimes those things can
[48:39] continue on when we're older we always
[48:41] want to I would like to be friends with
[48:43] this person I want to be friends with
[48:44] this person and we're always looking and
[48:46] but you know maybe that person maybe the
[48:50] things right then and there maybe things
[48:51] don't aren't going to be complementary
[48:53] but to understand that when God brings
[48:56] friends together
[48:58] I believe friends are predestinated
[49:01] I believe that you know and I believe
[49:04] that when we bring friends together I
[49:06] believe it's not a one-way Street I
[49:08] believe it's two-way
[49:09] God told Abraham he said you'll be
[49:11] blessed and you'll be a blessing
[49:13] amen so it's wonderful isn't it when God
[49:15] brings our Pathways across and it just
[49:18] God knows what we have need of you know
[49:20] and I tell you that's that's a glorious
[49:22] Revelation when we can come to that and
[49:24] just say hey you know what God knows
[49:26] what I need the people that he brings in
[49:28] into our lives and us into their lives
[49:31] and we're we're part of a body amen and
[49:34] we just I'm just so thankful for that
[49:36] and I I just thank God for his grace and
[49:39] so we just appreciate the song service
[49:43] this morning and the the specials and so
[49:46] if you would turn with me First Peter
[49:48] chapter 5.
[49:51] yeah
[49:54] I want to read just uh from this verse
[49:56] of scripture here just a
[50:01] once again here this morning
[50:08] in in First Peter 5 and verse 5
[50:15] amen God bless you
[50:18] my brother and sister keener's daughter
[50:20] I forgot your name I'm sorry
[50:22] God bless you Emily I I knew that I
[50:25] forgot it forgive me
[50:26] you know you would think being a school
[50:28] teacher this guy would remember names
[50:30] but I I had to carry a a list of people
[50:33] from my classroom for a month before I
[50:36] got their names so I wish I was better
[50:40] with that so that's why we give our
[50:42] secrets away that's why I went oh God
[50:44] bless you brother
[50:48] but I'm glad we got Grace for one
[50:50] another amen if there you got to have a
[50:52] lot of Grace with me but that's one area
[50:54] you really have to and I have to have it
[50:56] for you as well so I'm glad that God
[50:59] knows my name and he knows your name
[51:01] aren't you glad for that amen I'm glad
[51:04] about that amen verse 5.
[51:07] likewise you younger submit yourselves
[51:10] unto the Elder
[51:12] yay all of you be subject one to another
[51:17] I want you just to think of this for a
[51:19] moment when you see these words subject
[51:21] here and as it's used in the scripture
[51:25] um it's not a demand
[51:27] it is it is God's divine order that it
[51:31] would come out of a surrender that's
[51:34] what this word subjection is where it's
[51:36] a a surrender
[51:38] and so that's what it is it's not so yea
[51:42] all of you be subject one to another
[51:45] and be clothed with humility
[51:48] for God resisteth the proud and giveth
[51:51] grace to the humble
[51:54] humble yourselves therefore under the
[51:57] mighty hand of God that he may exalt you
[52:02] in due time casting all your care upon
[52:07] him
[52:08] for he careth for you
[52:11] amen God bless you bless the reading of
[52:14] the word as you're being seated
[52:15] I I just like to continue
[52:18] the thought here this morning on Grace
[52:23] to the humble we've been looking at the
[52:25] grace of God here for some time and um
[52:28] I want to just go from this scripture
[52:30] and
[52:31] just recognizing and looking within it
[52:35] the promise and this is us this is a
[52:38] promise that not only has God made in
[52:41] verse 6 over and over through the
[52:44] scriptures you'll find it worded time
[52:47] and time again James The Book of
[52:49] Proverbs and so forth
[52:51] but you you find this that there's
[52:53] always it's a very simple principle but
[52:55] it's always it always in every case of
[52:59] everyone down through the heroes hall of
[53:03] fame in Hebrews 11. everyone that we've
[53:06] ever heard about in Sunday school Gideon
[53:08] David and so forth these were always
[53:11] everyone that's ever been used of God
[53:13] this has been the principle that they've
[53:16] come to and you know I want to say it in
[53:19] this way
[53:20] it has to be God's grace
[53:23] to lead us to the place of humility that
[53:27] God recognizes
[53:28] and so it all puts it back to it's not
[53:31] anything that we can do we we are
[53:34] insufficient in ourselves but it's God
[53:36] by his grace that is all sufficient to
[53:39] lead us to the place that we need to be
[53:43] and when we can see this that it's
[53:46] always been God fulfilling his word in
[53:48] his time and season in verse six I want
[53:50] to just let me read it once more time
[53:52] humble yourselves therefore under the
[53:56] mighty hand of God and that is that's
[53:59] God revealing himself god making himself
[54:02] known personally to you and to me that's
[54:06] God's desire is to make himself known to
[54:09] you and I God God's not like you know
[54:12] someone where you go to see him and you
[54:14] probably never see him they just you
[54:16] know maybe a higher up in a company or
[54:18] whatever and they send out their little
[54:20] guys or whatever they are go see them go
[54:22] see what they want and go take care of
[54:24] them and this and that and you know the
[54:26] only thing you see of them is a picture
[54:27] oh they're the CEO of the company and
[54:30] they're this and I'm not saying all are
[54:31] like that but you understand what I mean
[54:33] God's not that way God matter of fact
[54:36] God don't want anybody else taking his
[54:40] message to you other than himself you
[54:43] might say well what's the use of
[54:44] preachers well listen the Bible says how
[54:47] can he pray preach unless he be sent how
[54:51] how is he sent he sent by the same Holy
[54:53] Ghost so it must be the spirit of God
[54:56] delivering the message and so that's
[54:58] what we must have as the spirit of the
[55:00] Living God and then what is that when
[55:02] God comes and deals with our heart
[55:04] that's the mighty hand of God dealing
[55:06] with our life and at that moment when we
[55:08] just surrender to that then it's when
[55:10] God moving in our lives he in his own
[55:14] due time will exalt exalt Us in his own
[55:18] due time and what he'll exalt is what we
[55:21] couldn't even see in our own selves but
[55:23] he knows as laid there the whole time
[55:24] just like the seeds that he planted in
[55:27] Genesis before Genesis 1 their seed was
[55:30] laying already in the earth and only
[55:32] thing that had to happen is is get rid
[55:34] move back all the darkness move back all
[55:37] of those things in order to bring forth
[55:39] what was there and God knows how to
[55:41] bring break back all the darkness and
[55:43] things out of our life so I want to go
[55:45] to Isaiah 57 15 and read here in the
[55:48] scripture
[55:50] and draw just continue to work with this
[55:52] point in Isaiah 57 15.
[55:56] it says for thus saith the high and
[55:58] lofty one that inhabiteth
[56:01] eternity whose name is Holy I don't know
[56:03] about you but when you first if you just
[56:05] read those first few words high and
[56:08] laughter you would think you know you're
[56:09] going to see someone who comes out as
[56:14] that's our thoughts of things
[56:16] see these are thoughts these are things
[56:18] that the word comes to deal with is our
[56:20] thoughts about things
[56:22] but notice God's thought about what is
[56:26] high and lofty
[56:29] I whose name is Holy I dwell in the high
[56:34] and holy place with him also that is of
[56:39] a contrite and humble spirit
[56:43] so now here we have the view that that
[56:45] which is high and lofty that which is
[56:47] mighty is that which is of a contrite
[56:51] and a humble spirit
[56:54] and you would think well a mighty God
[56:57] The God That Could part the Red Sea I
[57:00] know and that same God would come down
[57:02] and make known that he cares enough
[57:04] about your situation
[57:07] to speak to your heart to move upon your
[57:10] life that's what makes him God to me
[57:13] that he's willing to become that little
[57:15] that simple and God to manifest himself
[57:18] in his might that not only does he know
[57:20] my problem he cares about me but he's
[57:23] able to do something about it
[57:25] so I want you to think of this I dwell
[57:27] in the high and holy place with him also
[57:29] that is of a contrite and humble Spirit
[57:31] to revive the spirit of the humble and
[57:35] to revive the heart of the contrite ones
[57:39] I want you to listen to this this
[57:41] statement brother Brown makes in in the
[57:44] message love and he this is in regards
[57:47] to when he's walked into the pasture
[57:49] where that bull has rose up that had
[57:52] killed a man just the you know the just
[57:54] weeks ago and brother Brandon was
[57:57] unaware that this bull was in that
[57:59] um uh posture that was there and you
[58:02] know here's brother Bradley walks in
[58:04] there and I want you to notice what he
[58:05] says he says so here I was standing
[58:07] there and that's all I could do I
[58:10] thought well I certainly will do this
[58:12] how not go down a coward I'll go down
[58:15] showing my love of God in my heart to
[58:20] break in on this brother Branham at
[58:21] first when he tells us over and over in
[58:23] different places all throughout the
[58:25] message that that at first what came Was
[58:27] Fear
[58:29] to be natural
[58:30] now come on I know people sitting right
[58:33] here that don't act like it could be a
[58:35] little ant crawling on the ground
[58:38] I ain't gonna call no names now
[58:42] but let alone you say why because
[58:44] there's certain things that can that can
[58:45] bring you know fear within you you know
[58:47] you you get a call you know in the in
[58:49] the middle of the night you know or you
[58:51] have a you know if you know you're a
[58:53] mama and you get a call you know from
[58:54] your son and you here you are you let
[58:56] them know the plans of everything for
[58:58] the evening you get a call oh my
[58:59] goodness what's going on and then you
[59:01] realize the call was where was the
[59:02] peanut butter at mom you know
[59:05] some things that kind of alarm you
[59:07] is that right
[59:09] yeah I said mamas because usually dads
[59:12] are kind of like they'll be all right
[59:15] be all right
[59:17] be all right Band-Aids in there buddy
[59:21] peroxide if you need some in there it'd
[59:23] be all right that's that's that's dads
[59:25] but aren't you glad that God God is Not
[59:28] Just God is not just like that but God
[59:30] also He's our mother
[59:33] the holy spirit is our mother same God
[59:36] is that right to move and brood over our
[59:38] life
[59:39] so I'm just so thankful God cares aren't
[59:42] you uh so when we look at this brother
[59:44] Raymond's talking about how that even in
[59:46] that moment of where he he made a choice
[59:48] to change his thoughts because fear was
[59:51] gripping but you see this is to me a
[59:54] principle of how that when we look at it
[59:56] perfect love casts out all fear it
[59:59] didn't say that fear wouldn't come so if
[1:00:01] the devil wants to run you down of well
[1:00:03] does Fear come your life or fear has
[1:00:05] come about a doctor's report or fear
[1:00:07] listen that doesn't mean nothing about
[1:00:09] your soul
[1:00:11] are you hearing me fears can come the
[1:00:13] difference of the fear of the soul is
[1:00:15] where you don't know where you're
[1:00:16] standing with God and where you would be
[1:00:17] what if your life was required at this
[1:00:20] moment where would you stand before God
[1:00:23] you see it to live with that kind of
[1:00:25] assurance and it affects everything else
[1:00:26] in your life when you have the love of
[1:00:28] God As a matter of fact then you have
[1:00:30] the strength to overcome and subdue
[1:00:32] every fear that wants to come in
[1:00:35] so here the prophet was standing there
[1:00:37] in that moment and he says I'll go down
[1:00:39] showing my love of God in my heart and I
[1:00:41] look back at that bull and all of a
[1:00:43] sudden something happened now this
[1:00:46] sounds kiddish it sounds like a little
[1:00:49] baby talk but that's what the trouble
[1:00:51] with us tonight we tried to be an adult
[1:00:55] in God when we ought to be babies in God
[1:00:59] we know so much God dwells in the center
[1:01:05] of humility and simplicity
[1:01:09] don't never forget to Heavenly say Lord
[1:01:12] thank you for the reminder this morning
[1:01:15] thank you for the reminder let you know
[1:01:18] hey if we've got if we've got these
[1:01:21] things coming up notifications on our
[1:01:23] phone maybe this would be a good
[1:01:24] notification to come up regularly
[1:01:27] throughout the day
[1:01:28] don't never forget that I looked at the
[1:01:32] bowling of anything I could have cried
[1:01:34] for him why I thought poor creature well
[1:01:37] how wrong I am
[1:01:39] now ordinarily
[1:01:41] I wouldn't feel that way about it
[1:01:47] in the tremendous how God in that moment
[1:01:50] noticed just a thought changing of our
[1:01:54] thoughts to what is true I'm not going
[1:01:57] to go down as a coward I am going to go
[1:01:59] down with the love of God in my heart
[1:02:03] and that brother bam tells us even when
[1:02:05] the maniac came across the stage
[1:02:06] thoughts came in his mind
[1:02:09] are you with me this morning brother Ram
[1:02:11] says he sized him up in one place
[1:02:15] okay he wasn't sizing him up to see what
[1:02:16] kind of size suit he wore he was sizing
[1:02:19] him up there was still part of that of
[1:02:21] that Boxer that was still there but you
[1:02:23] see he chose to think different thoughts
[1:02:25] that's exactly the phrase that brother
[1:02:27] Brahm uses he says I chose to think
[1:02:30] different thoughts it's a choice
[1:02:34] it's a choice
[1:02:35] what a powerful thing A Simple Choice
[1:02:39] hey this Choice let me just say in
[1:02:41] reality this choice is more simple than
[1:02:43] what you're going to choose to eat after
[1:02:45] church
[1:02:47] it's real simple
[1:02:48] notice in Matthew 11 28 Jesus said come
[1:02:52] unto me all ye that labor and are heavy
[1:02:55] laden and I will give you rest
[1:02:58] take my yoke upon you and learn of me
[1:03:03] for I am now watch this for I am meek
[1:03:07] and lowly humble in heart
[1:03:11] and you shall find rest unto your souls
[1:03:13] for my yoke is easy and my burden is
[1:03:18] light
[1:03:20] Samuel it's such a burden to serve the
[1:03:23] Lord you haven't come to this place yet
[1:03:26] because this yoke is not a yoke of
[1:03:30] bondage it's a yoke of divine love
[1:03:33] it's where everything that happens in
[1:03:36] life every test every trial it's all
[1:03:40] laced with the love and grace of
[1:03:42] almighty God
[1:03:44] it's where it's no longer his his his
[1:03:47] his word is no longer Grievous
[1:03:51] oh I have to do this oh we have to do
[1:03:55] this and if I don't do this what are the
[1:03:58] people at the church going to think are
[1:03:59] you
[1:04:00] first of all you're looking at the wrong
[1:04:02] person
[1:04:03] people you're looking at the wrong thing
[1:04:05] it's him it's about him
[1:04:09] he says come unto me not come unto it
[1:04:12] come unto me and I will give you rest
[1:04:16] for your soul so here brother Brown
[1:04:19] takes this and this this this quote I've
[1:04:22] just been pondering here over a few
[1:04:24] weeks and just just struck me how
[1:04:26] brother Brown said it and he's talking
[1:04:27] about how that even when the Lord Jesus
[1:04:30] was taken up to mount Transfiguration
[1:04:32] and we recognize at that moment here at
[1:04:35] the cloud overshadow here was Moses
[1:04:37] Elijah here was also the disciples and
[1:04:40] here there is the adornment there where
[1:04:43] his raiment did shine it's the adoption
[1:04:45] ceremony it's the placing of a son at
[1:04:50] that moment and brother Brown makes this
[1:04:52] statement and he says he says what he
[1:04:54] says what God was doing he says God
[1:04:57] never asked anybody to do anything that
[1:05:01] he doesn't do himself
[1:05:03] so let me just make it very simple it
[1:05:06] would be like
[1:05:08] if when the boss asks you to sweep the
[1:05:10] floor if the boss himself is not willing
[1:05:13] to sweep the floor and hasn't swept it
[1:05:14] before
[1:05:16] see God doesn't ask you to do something
[1:05:18] that he himself
[1:05:21] doesn't do
[1:05:23] he's our example aren't you glad that's
[1:05:26] why when God came down and became flesh
[1:05:28] it was not another set of Commandments
[1:05:30] no we didn't need another word we needed
[1:05:32] one to come and manifest and fulfill the
[1:05:36] word that was given
[1:05:39] Hallelujah
[1:05:40] God never asked anybody to do anything
[1:05:43] that he doesn't do himself that's the
[1:05:46] reason I love this that I believe in the
[1:05:50] deity of our Lord Jesus Christ that he
[1:05:53] was more than a man he was more than a
[1:05:56] prophet yet he was a prophet yet he was
[1:05:59] a man but he was more than that he was
[1:06:01] Emmanuel he was God manifested in flesh
[1:06:04] and I believe it that's exactly what he
[1:06:06] was because any man or a prophet or an
[1:06:09] ordinary person would be born like we
[1:06:11] are and we're still in our sins but you
[1:06:13] see he was born a virgin birth and no
[1:06:16] one had nothing to do with it but God
[1:06:19] himself the god the Creator overshadowed
[1:06:22] the Virgin Mary and created in her a
[1:06:26] blood cell what did Mary finally have to
[1:06:30] come to be it unto me according to Thy
[1:06:35] Word
[1:06:38] not me not my thoughts about it but Thy
[1:06:40] Word
[1:06:44] John 1 18 no man think of this no man
[1:06:48] hath seen God at any time
[1:06:51] the only begotten which is in the bosom
[1:06:54] of the father he hath declared him
[1:07:00] but Branham says it like this and sir we
[1:07:02] would see Jesus
[1:07:03] let me know what you think of this he
[1:07:05] didn't even have a place to lay his head
[1:07:08] he didn't even have a place that would
[1:07:10] be uh what we would describe as a proper
[1:07:14] birthing place
[1:07:16] a proper place to be born it would seem
[1:07:18] this is the king of glory this is not
[1:07:21] this is not the second in command it was
[1:07:24] God himself stepping forth to redeem you
[1:07:27] and I
[1:07:28] am that's what he did in the beginning
[1:07:30] is it not God didn't send a different
[1:07:33] Spirit to come and Brew The Brood over
[1:07:35] the Earth God himself who spoke his word
[1:07:37] came himself and brought back the
[1:07:39] darkness in order to bring forth life
[1:07:42] and when the fall took place in Eden God
[1:07:45] didn't send an angel in his dead God
[1:07:47] came down
[1:07:49] God investigated
[1:07:52] Hallelujah and when it was all said and
[1:07:55] done God himself took his finger and
[1:07:57] spelled out l-o-v-e I will make her way
[1:08:00] back for you
[1:08:03] foxes have dens the scripture tells us
[1:08:09] he had nothing
[1:08:11] I'm talking about
[1:08:13] the busty one he who dwells in a high
[1:08:15] and holy place
[1:08:17] he had nothing he demanded nothing when
[1:08:20] he came
[1:08:21] because why he's here for one purpose he
[1:08:24] is the word he comes to fulfill the word
[1:08:26] and manifest the word that's the whole
[1:08:28] and full Council
[1:08:32] very simple
[1:08:34] statement here
[1:08:36] he come out of the message he come to
[1:08:40] show
[1:08:41] what God was
[1:08:46] that speaks to me
[1:08:49] listen he didn't just he didn't just
[1:08:52] come here and say Hey listen
[1:08:54] I don't have time for all this stuff I'm
[1:08:56] here I'm here to go to Calvary
[1:08:58] but along the way
[1:09:00] it was every fulfillment of every word
[1:09:03] of God
[1:09:05] the sick were being healed and the Bible
[1:09:07] says that it might be fulfilled
[1:09:09] he hath bore our sicknesses
[1:09:14] he took time Brother Richard to look at
[1:09:17] the Widow of name where she was grieving
[1:09:20] her son was being carried if we could
[1:09:22] say it in a beer which would maybe be
[1:09:24] like that of a hearse a casket here it
[1:09:26] is it's being carried he took notice
[1:09:30] of her Brokenness
[1:09:32] and he was moved the Bible said he
[1:09:35] groaned within himself
[1:09:37] and he spoke
[1:09:40] and that that life came back into that
[1:09:43] young man
[1:09:44] he cared enough
[1:09:46] we're a young man
[1:09:47] the eyes came back into not just came
[1:09:50] back but eyes were created there in the
[1:09:52] sockets
[1:09:53] the man who was born blind
[1:09:56] those that were lepers think about it
[1:09:58] those were lepers
[1:10:01] he came down and he he was concerned
[1:10:04] you might say brother Samuel he would
[1:10:06] come to me listen and I want you to
[1:10:09] understand this in the right way when he
[1:10:11] came down to the pool of Bethesda he had
[1:10:14] to step over a lot of people not on him
[1:10:17] over him because in this Mass
[1:10:21] of humanity that was sick and laid out
[1:10:25] he was sent to that pool
[1:10:28] s and me his human compassion would have
[1:10:31] healed everybody
[1:10:34] that's why this message it's for
[1:10:37] everybody brother bam says it's for
[1:10:39] everybody if they will receive it
[1:10:42] this message is not barrier lines
[1:10:45] denomination lines and this it's not
[1:10:47] it's Christ
[1:10:49] it's Christ being revealed it's will you
[1:10:52] receive him
[1:10:53] [Music]
[1:10:58] and he went to that man and that man
[1:10:59] walked away from there and he did not
[1:11:02] have anything left to remain to come
[1:11:04] back to
[1:11:08] those that were sick those that were
[1:11:10] hungry
[1:11:11] okay we could talk about one thing of
[1:11:13] being of the sickness but what about
[1:11:15] those who are hungry he took notice
[1:11:18] they're hungry we need to give them
[1:11:20] something
[1:11:23] well why don't we just close the meeting
[1:11:25] and send them home because we sure don't
[1:11:26] have enough
[1:11:28] right human thoughts would have thought
[1:11:30] that
[1:11:31] but Jesus wanted to express
[1:11:34] I am your caretaker
[1:11:37] I am your provider when you're locked in
[1:11:40] on the word and you're locked in on me I
[1:11:43] will provide all that you have need of
[1:11:47] I'm mindful of every detail even the
[1:11:49] things that you don't deem spiritual you
[1:11:52] are my children you are my spiritual
[1:11:55] sons and daughters and I am your
[1:11:57] provider
[1:12:02] he come to show what God was
[1:12:07] anything that's high and haughty
[1:12:11] somebody say it with me
[1:12:13] isn't God
[1:12:17] let me read it again anything that's
[1:12:19] high and Hardy
[1:12:22] God is low and humble
[1:12:27] now let me just tell you humble is not
[1:12:29] you drawing your attention to yourself
[1:12:32] well I've got holy pants and I've got
[1:12:35] friends you know my skirts friends and
[1:12:37] you know I'm not keeping my hair and and
[1:12:39] this and that no what you need to get
[1:12:41] cleaned up
[1:12:42] and there's people that'll help you with
[1:12:44] different it that ain't it ain't why you
[1:12:46] let in you making yourself look humble
[1:12:49] come on friends you understand what I'm
[1:12:51] saying
[1:12:52] that ain't what it is we're talking
[1:12:54] about a humility on the inside in your
[1:12:57] show
[1:12:58] [Music]
[1:12:59] because the Pharisees were humble on the
[1:13:02] outside
[1:13:04] and Jesus said you've omitted the way
[1:13:07] the Earth matters of the law
[1:13:10] you've even gave a tithe on Anderson
[1:13:12] mint and cumin but you omitted the most
[1:13:15] important thing love mercy and faith
[1:13:18] [Applause]
[1:13:21] it's not just what you see on the
[1:13:24] outside
[1:13:25] but God is a god of humility that
[1:13:28] manifests himself God is a spirit and
[1:13:31] they that worship Him must worship Him
[1:13:33] in spirit and Truth God is low and
[1:13:36] humble and that's what made him God
[1:13:39] oh something that comes low not them
[1:13:42] that goes High
[1:13:44] so God doesn't dwell in hierarchies and
[1:13:46] things oh I'm glad
[1:13:48] he dwells in humility
[1:13:51] the way up is down humble yourself and
[1:13:56] you'll be exalted exalt yourself and
[1:13:58] you'll be humble that's right God knows
[1:14:01] how to do it and has done it and
[1:14:02] continues to do it for every one of us
[1:14:08] listen what are you saying that when God
[1:14:10] Saves us cleans our life up and fills us
[1:14:13] with the Holy Ghost he doesn't step away
[1:14:16] as one who doesn't care he's right there
[1:14:19] with you he said I'll never leave you
[1:14:21] I'll never forsake you he's the same God
[1:14:24] moving and molding and moving in our
[1:14:27] life to do what bringing us into a
[1:14:29] further place of humility
[1:14:32] because every time for the word to come
[1:14:35] forth and be expressed it will always
[1:14:36] come to pass because we have been able
[1:14:39] to Humble ourselves
[1:14:42] and that takes God's grace so you have
[1:14:44] to remember humble yourself before God
[1:14:47] don't
[1:14:49] try
[1:14:50] to think
[1:14:52] your own thoughts
[1:14:55] think his thoughts amen
[1:14:57] amen Hey listen your your mind is your
[1:15:00] is known it's called No Man's Land
[1:15:02] all right
[1:15:04] now don't interpret No Man's Land as
[1:15:05] being an empty space
[1:15:08] you know a Happy Meal without the
[1:15:09] contents that's not what we're saying
[1:15:11] but no man's land means if
[1:15:15] your mind will only be filled with what
[1:15:18] you fill it with
[1:15:20] us oh the devil no no no no the devil
[1:15:22] can only put in your mind what you allow
[1:15:24] to be put in your mind
[1:15:26] oh the devil been telling me last month
[1:15:28] he told me this like you're like you're
[1:15:30] guiding me around your mind like you've
[1:15:32] been stuck in his boxes well the devil
[1:15:34] told me this over here come over here I
[1:15:36] want to show you what devil told me over
[1:15:37] here the devil told me this right here
[1:15:38] hold on a minute he got a good one in
[1:15:39] this box right here the devil said this
[1:15:41] right over here he said this on let me
[1:15:42] see what he said it he said it back on
[1:15:43] September 15th 10 30 a.m in the morning
[1:15:45] when I woke up he said this yep it's
[1:15:47] right there in that box third one down
[1:15:48] hitting an amazing we can remember every
[1:15:51] single word of a liar
[1:15:53] and God's word is truth
[1:15:58] well brother Samuel he's speaking about
[1:16:00] my failures but your failures are not
[1:16:02] who you are
[1:16:06] the word listen to me this word of an
[1:16:09] open book never came to reveal or redeem
[1:16:12] the Fallen character it came to redeem
[1:16:15] that character that name that life that
[1:16:19] was in God the whole time
[1:16:25] Philippians 2 5. let this mind
[1:16:30] be in you which was also in Christ Jesus
[1:16:35] who being in the form of God thought it
[1:16:38] not Robert to be equal with God but made
[1:16:40] himself of no reputation
[1:16:43] and took on him the form of a servant
[1:16:45] and was made in the likeness of men
[1:16:49] now usually anybody who
[1:16:52] you know brother man talks about the
[1:16:53] person who made the false teeth or
[1:16:55] artificial leg or all there's a lot more
[1:16:56] things now
[1:16:58] they're people of reputation
[1:17:01] I know there's individuals sitting right
[1:17:03] here that are inventors in this
[1:17:05] congregation right here this morning
[1:17:07] and I say this I can say it real simply
[1:17:10] that are not the kind of people you
[1:17:12] wouldn't know about unless they unless
[1:17:13] you really probed and talked to him
[1:17:15] I'm not gonna call their name
[1:17:18] but you see it's kind of different when
[1:17:20] you have somebody else who's invented
[1:17:21] something
[1:17:23] and then they want to
[1:17:24] they got their own horn
[1:17:30] dude
[1:17:34] the man who invented the wrapper for
[1:17:36] bubble gum
[1:17:37] [Laughter]
[1:17:39] life-changing man
[1:17:41] life-changing whoa
[1:17:46] you say brother Samuel let me tell you
[1:17:49] you know why this you know where this
[1:17:50] Lays
[1:17:52] this lays from that first birth
[1:17:55] because the whole enticement was
[1:17:58] you'll be as God
[1:18:03] it's an enticement
[1:18:05] that's why it continually dying to
[1:18:09] ourselves
[1:18:11] and took on him the form of a servant
[1:18:14] one who's given to another's will and
[1:18:17] was made in the likeness of men and
[1:18:19] being found
[1:18:21] in fashion as a man
[1:18:23] he humbled himself
[1:18:26] and became obedient unto death
[1:18:29] even the death of the cross
[1:18:31] what did he pray in the garden
[1:18:34] three times
[1:18:35] nevertheless
[1:18:37] not my will
[1:18:39] but thine will
[1:18:41] be done
[1:18:43] three times
[1:18:45] it wasn't an act it wasn't a formality
[1:18:48] it was a wrestling match
[1:18:52] God's will he knew the purpose he knew
[1:18:55] what he was here for
[1:18:58] right even the previous chapters in John
[1:19:00] 12 he says now is my soul trembled
[1:19:03] trembled he knew where he was facing
[1:19:06] knew what he was coming for he knew the
[1:19:07] death that awaited him
[1:19:10] he knew that he wasn't ignorant of that
[1:19:12] and here he was if it's possible let
[1:19:15] this cup pass from me
[1:19:16] let it pass on to someone else
[1:19:19] but here the wrestling you see what it
[1:19:22] is even though he asked if it's possible
[1:19:23] let it be Pastor somebody else he
[1:19:25] couldn't get away from the will of God
[1:19:28] that he was always a part of
[1:19:31] are you hearing me now that's the same
[1:19:33] way it is in your life in my life you
[1:19:35] can't get away from the will of God of
[1:19:38] what God has willed to be about your
[1:19:40] life as a Believer as the Son and
[1:19:42] Daughter of God
[1:19:44] I don't even care where you're sitting
[1:19:46] at here this morning you can't defeat
[1:19:48] the will and purpose of almighty God you
[1:19:51] belong to God God's going to get you
[1:19:55] and he's not going to get you with an
[1:19:56] iron fist or a big arm he's going to
[1:19:59] bring you in a place of humility the
[1:20:02] same way he came
[1:20:04] nevertheless
[1:20:06] not my will
[1:20:08] thine will be done
[1:20:12] look what a victory that brought right
[1:20:14] when that was that just that that's that
[1:20:17] that that Victory hell
[1:20:21] received a torment in its own Chambers
[1:20:26] Satan was being cast out by the Finger
[1:20:28] of God
[1:20:30] of lives
[1:20:32] and Maniac could gather they were being
[1:20:34] cast out
[1:20:35] but now here comes the word and takes it
[1:20:38] right down
[1:20:39] to the chambers of hell he went through
[1:20:41] the lowest parts of hell
[1:20:43] right he he who knew no sin became my
[1:20:46] sin
[1:20:48] that we might be made the righteousness
[1:20:50] of God in Christ
[1:20:52] he deposited he took it down there and
[1:20:54] stripped Satan of his power and his
[1:20:57] authority he took his keys to his own
[1:20:58] house
[1:21:00] how would you like it today if you had
[1:21:02] to ask me for keys to get in your house
[1:21:06] you said brother Samuel that's silly no
[1:21:08] it's not you know what that speaks of
[1:21:09] that the devil don't have no power or no
[1:21:12] dominion over you he's only lying to you
[1:21:15] to try to make you think like you can't
[1:21:18] serve God you can't do this you can't
[1:21:20] live Victorious he doesn't have the keys
[1:21:23] he's been stripped of it
[1:21:26] brother the shine has a rose
[1:21:29] [Applause]
[1:21:30] [Music]
[1:21:33] Galatians 3 13 Christ hath redeemed us
[1:21:37] from the curse of the law being made a
[1:21:40] curse for us for it is written cursed is
[1:21:43] everyone that hangeth on a tree
[1:21:45] that The Blessing of Abraham might come

[1:22:41] attention on him or what my mind got to
[1:22:44] do with it and we're dealing with that
[1:22:46] your mind's got a lot to do with it

[1:23:42] looking unto Jesus the author and
[1:23:45] finisher of our faith
[1:23:48] oh my who for the joy that was set
[1:23:52] before him
[1:23:54] endured the cross
[1:23:56] despising the shame and is set down at
[1:24:01] the right hand of the Throne of God
[1:24:02] think of this he endured the cross
[1:24:04] despising the same
[1:24:06] the Bible said he was led as a lamb
[1:24:09] to the slaughter
[1:24:16] he did not fight going to Calvary
[1:24:19] he surrendered
[1:24:22] he was led
[1:24:24] fell many times that we know how Simon
[1:24:28] had to pick up and help him
[1:24:30] but needless to say he was carrying the
[1:24:33] cross that was needed
[1:24:36] is that right
[1:24:38] he despised the shame what kind of kind
[1:24:40] of shame that he despised by his FES
[1:24:41] because he himself became stripped till
[1:24:46] there was nothing else to be taken off
[1:24:50] it was not a loincloth there were not
[1:24:53] things wrapped around you say why would
[1:24:54] God do that because it was only
[1:24:56] displaying where you and I would have to
[1:24:59] come to a place to where we would be
[1:25:01] stripped of every single thing in our
[1:25:05] lives amen and sometimes the things that
[1:25:08] we don't even want to be stripped of I
[1:25:10] don't want nobody going there I don't
[1:25:12] want nobody judging this I don't want
[1:25:13] this I don't want that but you see he
[1:25:15] himself went to a level of shame that
[1:25:18] the vilest of Sinner no matter what
[1:25:21] you've done God himself came down and
[1:25:24] paid the price for your Redemption
[1:25:27] oh what love of God how rich and pure
[1:25:32] he came to the death of shame that
[1:25:35] nobody could say Lord you don't know my
[1:25:38] situation I was a this or I did this or
[1:25:41] I did that he
[1:25:43] went to the lowest
[1:25:44] [Applause]
[1:25:47] he bore our shame nakedness you know why
[1:25:51] that's what happened in the garden
[1:25:53] nakedness was discovered
[1:25:57] but aren't you glad there came one
[1:26:00] what Satan could not see there was
[1:26:03] fixing to come this same garment that
[1:26:05] had adorned the son of the Living God
[1:26:07] this same garment was fixing to be
[1:26:10] handed back to the Church of the Living
[1:26:12] God to the redeemed of the Lord Satan
[1:26:15] couldn't understand it why because
[1:26:17] Satan's pretense or everything that he
[1:26:19] dwells on is pride
[1:26:22] but he who is high and lofty the high
[1:26:25] and Holy One dwells in the center of
[1:26:29] humility
[1:26:30] and simplicity
[1:26:33] he defeated Satan's plan and Kingdom
[1:26:38] by humbling himself
[1:26:40] to the word
[1:26:43] aren't you glad
[1:26:45] this is why brother Bam's simple
[1:26:47] statement that day on Calvary this is
[1:26:49] one of those statements to be good put
[1:26:50] on the refrigerator because we visit
[1:26:51] there enough
[1:26:52] have your day Calvary it's a good one
[1:26:55] have your day your debris and God will
[1:26:57] have his
[1:26:59] work because you can't go and go to
[1:27:00] Calvary and come out of stuffed shirt
[1:27:03] you can go to Calvary and continue to
[1:27:05] hold your own ideas
[1:27:07] now I believe we need more trips to
[1:27:09] Calvary
[1:27:10] but you hear me I believe that God I
[1:27:12] want another trip to Calvary I normally
[1:27:14] won the trip that changes my life but I
[1:27:16] want to continue to be changed
[1:27:18] continue to be changed yeah I want to be
[1:27:20] changed So eventually this body
[1:27:24] has come to a place to match what's on
[1:27:27] the inside
[1:27:28] to repressing to that of the Rapture
[1:27:31] that here that those are alive and
[1:27:33] remain we take our glorified body and
[1:27:35] merge with our theophany and there we
[1:27:37] stand the redeemed soul theophany and
[1:27:39] glorified body
[1:27:43] I don't know about you but I I I'm I'm
[1:27:45] longing to put off this guy
[1:27:51] aren't you glad you won't have to just
[1:27:52] block his number block his text he'll be
[1:27:55] gone
[1:27:56] he'll be gone
[1:27:58] now to sight out of mind
[1:28:01] have your day at Calvary and God will
[1:28:04] have his way with you he said let me
[1:28:05] quote that again have your day at
[1:28:07] Calvary and God will have his way with
[1:28:09] you now these thoughts that we think
[1:28:12] about how many believe your thoughts
[1:28:13] matter
[1:28:15] sure they matter
[1:28:17] it's like one of the things where we get
[1:28:18] ready to go when when I play football
[1:28:20] one of the things we did in our coach in
[1:28:22] our locker room he played the same
[1:28:24] things all the time I remember the guy's
[1:28:25] name the guy it wasn't it wasn't Rudy or
[1:28:27] nothing like that but it was some guy
[1:28:28] who played knows tackle for Michigan I
[1:28:30] know that may be a bad word to speak
[1:28:31] here but he he played for it he played
[1:28:33] for Michigan as a nose tackle the guy
[1:28:34] shouldn't even been on the field and
[1:28:36] coach Cook played this thing four years
[1:28:38] straight before every game
[1:28:40] it was about it's about a guy brother
[1:28:42] Joy who should not have been on the team
[1:28:43] he was he wasn't giving a scholarship
[1:28:45] was told there ain't no way you're gonna
[1:28:46] make this team you're not going to do
[1:28:47] this you're not gonna he kept coming he
[1:28:49] kept coming he kept working he kept
[1:28:50] working kept working no doubt he had to
[1:28:52] work he had to work a lot harder and
[1:28:53] you're hearing this being told over and
[1:28:54] over you think well why would that be
[1:28:56] before a game because we weren't allowed
[1:28:57] to talk we weren't allowed to laugh
[1:28:58] there better be and I'll be nothing
[1:29:00] going on in pregame dinner or at the
[1:29:02] locker room it was complete silence get
[1:29:03] your thoughts on what you're planning to
[1:29:06] do
[1:29:06] on the business you're planning to take
[1:29:08] care of tonight you get your thoughts
[1:29:10] focused
[1:29:13] to me I think that was pretty good
[1:29:15] application
[1:29:16] you know you'll either be victorious in
[1:29:18] your thoughts or you'll be defeated if
[1:29:19] you go out thinking you're going to
[1:29:21] fight listen not just an opponent out
[1:29:22] here but if you go out of here today
[1:29:24] saying I'll never be here I'll never
[1:29:25] think this listen you are defeated by
[1:29:28] your own thoughts
[1:29:30] your thoughts don't you realize how
[1:29:33] powerful the mind is
[1:29:39] by the time did you ever get tired of
[1:29:40] hearing that no matter of fact I could
[1:29:42] probably repeat a lot of it over those
[1:29:43] times but I never got tired of repeating
[1:29:45] it because to me it always spoke about
[1:29:47] here was an individual who was the
[1:29:49] underdog absolutely impossible and when
[1:29:52] everything was wrote off but he kept
[1:29:54] being perseverant what that spoke to me
[1:29:56] is when a play don't go your way on the
[1:29:58] field get back up again and let's get
[1:29:59] more yardage when this doesn't go your
[1:30:01] way they score Hey listen I'm not trying
[1:30:03] to educate you about football I'm trying
[1:30:05] to tell you there's adversity that comes
[1:30:07] along in our life
[1:30:09] but adversity does not define you if you
[1:30:12] let it
[1:30:14] oh I'm a failure get back up again
[1:30:16] you're not a failure you might have
[1:30:18] failed but you're not a failure a
[1:30:21] failure is one who refuses
[1:30:24] to go on
[1:30:26] you don't know how many times I've
[1:30:28] failed well let me tell you his grace is
[1:30:30] so much greater than all your failed
[1:30:32] attempts because he's still dealing with
[1:30:35] your life
[1:30:37] [Applause]
[1:30:38] and I'm telling you if there's anybody
[1:30:40] here that's keeping track of your
[1:30:42] attempts they need a trip to Calvary
[1:30:46] because evidently they've forgotten the
[1:30:48] grace of God that's put up with them
[1:30:52] oh my Lord have mercy
[1:30:55] Jesus Christ the same listen this he
[1:30:57] says you you know he don't always come
[1:30:59] the way we think he's going to come
[1:31:03] this Falls crossed everything
[1:31:05] baptism of the Holy Ghost or healing on
[1:31:07] he don't come the way we think he's
[1:31:09] going to come
[1:31:10] he comes so humble
[1:31:14] the people has got it all fixed up the
[1:31:18] way they
[1:31:19] want him to come
[1:31:22] ah
[1:31:23] and we walk over humility and there's
[1:31:28] where you find God isn't that powerful
[1:31:30] we walk right over God
[1:31:33] and he's right there we're looking up
[1:31:36] here
[1:31:37] and Brother Band tells us we walk right
[1:31:39] over
[1:31:40] God why
[1:31:42] God makes himself
[1:31:44] humble
[1:31:46] in the Fulfillment of his word that
[1:31:48] brings us to a place to where where the
[1:31:51] Cardinals even getting on our knees and
[1:31:52] enough you've got to get down
[1:31:55] to see him
[1:31:58] well what is that getting down it's
[1:31:59] where it getting down in our heart
[1:32:03] getting down in our life how do I get
[1:32:05] down get away from your own
[1:32:07] thoughts
[1:32:10] scientists today can send a man into
[1:32:12] space in an orbit and walk over a blade
[1:32:15] of grass that he knows nothing about
[1:32:19] oh you got to humble yourself to know
[1:32:21] God you've got to get rid of
[1:32:25] your own ideas you talk about spring
[1:32:27] cleaning
[1:32:30] how many those words are talking about
[1:32:31] spring cleaning
[1:32:32] some of you realize when the basements
[1:32:34] were flooded and how terrible all those
[1:32:36] things were some weeks ago but some of
[1:32:37] you realize you know what she'd been
[1:32:38] doing this a long time ago should have
[1:32:40] been getting rid of this really didn't
[1:32:41] need this been keeping this been keeping
[1:32:42] that what was that that was a sweatshirt
[1:32:44] I wore in high school but honey you're
[1:32:45] 63 years old it's beyond I mean it won't
[1:32:47] even fit you it might be going around
[1:32:49] your arm right now but I doubt you down
[1:32:51] you can even get it over your head I
[1:32:52] mean why in the world you're keeping it
[1:32:54] for
[1:32:55] right but you see aren't you glad
[1:32:58] friends that there's sometimes things
[1:32:59] that we'll hold on to and we don't think
[1:33:02] too much about but God will come down
[1:33:03] and start dealing with and said hey we
[1:33:05] need to get this area cleaned out well
[1:33:07] why does he want to get it cleared out
[1:33:08] because he wants to fill it up with more
[1:33:09] of himself
[1:33:10] [Applause]
[1:33:12] oh Hallelujah you've got to get rid of
[1:33:15] your own ideas and just open up your
[1:33:17] heart and Life to him then he will make
[1:33:20] himself known to you you see we're
[1:33:23] either Victorious or defeated often
[1:33:26] times in our minds by the thoughts we
[1:33:28] allow to enter in
[1:33:30] you know we may say what do my thoughts
[1:33:32] what do they have to do with Grace and
[1:33:34] humility anytime you entertain a thought
[1:33:36] that is not the word of God it leads you
[1:33:40] away from God's desire
[1:33:42] what do you mean by entertainment I'm
[1:33:45] talking about where you let it dwell and
[1:33:47] you think on it
[1:33:50] and you start thinking on it guess what
[1:33:53] you'll start acting based on that
[1:33:57] it'll start affecting your walk with God
[1:34:02] it'll even start affecting your
[1:34:05] confession
[1:34:07] all from a thought
[1:34:10] you started to entertain
[1:34:12] listen in the beginning Satan came to
[1:34:15] Eve Eve knew God's revelation the Lord
[1:34:18] God has said but just a few moments of
[1:34:20] talking he had her breaking that
[1:34:23] revelation of Lord God
[1:34:25] yea hath God said
[1:34:29] just a few moments how powerful
[1:34:32] thoughts are so don't ever underestimate
[1:34:33] I'll tell you I'm a message believer
[1:34:35] glory to God there ain't nothing of this
[1:34:37] world going to face me and this and that
[1:34:39] you know what that's called Pride
[1:34:43] that's a homemade recipe that don't
[1:34:45] belong even in a mason jar
[1:34:49] well anytime you entertain a thought
[1:34:51] that's not the word of God it'll lead
[1:34:52] you away from God's desire but away from
[1:34:55] submission to his will
[1:34:58] let me tell you we are insufficient
[1:35:00] without God's grace in our lives
[1:35:03] the Bible said second Corinthians 10 5
[1:35:05] everybody okay
[1:35:07] second Corinthians 10 5 casting down
[1:35:09] imaginations means throw it down
[1:35:12] not just like you're putting a box or
[1:35:14] something that's oh this is this is
[1:35:16] fragile I've carried these thoughts with
[1:35:18] me all my life
[1:35:19] I've been told this all my life so be
[1:35:22] careful this is fragile
[1:35:24] I may have to come back to this and rely
[1:35:26] on it sometime
[1:35:29] throw it down
[1:35:31] because these things were not the
[1:35:33] creation of God
[1:35:35] let me tell you something Satan comes
[1:35:37] around and has every one of our lives
[1:35:39] from when we've been little young and
[1:35:41] all the way through still we battle
[1:35:43] against complexes
[1:35:45] and sometimes here we are we are not
[1:35:47] even aware of the complexes that we
[1:35:50] still have in our life you say what is a
[1:35:52] complex it's a way of thinking
[1:35:55] a way of thinking about things
[1:35:57] and God works to continue to dismantle
[1:36:00] those things aren't you glad
[1:36:02] God don't come around like I'd be coming
[1:36:04] into your basement said all right hey
[1:36:05] come on now let's get down here and
[1:36:07] clean this junk out
[1:36:10] junk I may have had it for 50 years but
[1:36:13] it ain't junk buddy
[1:36:17] what would you think about that
[1:36:19] first of all you'd say you know what
[1:36:21] just going back home I'm not interested
[1:36:23] here because there's going to be things
[1:36:24] you're going through there's no
[1:36:26] consideration
[1:36:28] that ain't God
[1:36:30] God will work a Month of Sundays he'll
[1:36:34] work years
[1:36:35] intricately taking apart a complex
[1:36:39] in our lives
[1:36:42] and if God would be that patient with
[1:36:44] you and I
[1:36:46] Lord help me to be patient while you're
[1:36:48] working on others
[1:36:50] you see the things God teaches us even
[1:36:52] by the experiences in our own life
[1:36:54] casting down imaginations and every High
[1:36:57] thing that exalteth itself against the
[1:37:00] knowledge of God and bringing into
[1:37:01] captivity every thought Through The
[1:37:04] Obedience of Christ Isaiah 55 7 let the
[1:37:07] wicked forsake his way and the
[1:37:10] unrighteous man his thoughts and let him
[1:37:13] return unto the Lord and He will have
[1:37:15] mercy upon him and to our God for he
[1:37:18] will abundantly pardon
[1:37:20] for my thoughts are not your thoughts
[1:37:26] come on Friends some of you won't
[1:37:27] believe any of these characters that are
[1:37:30] so-called politicians you wouldn't dare
[1:37:32] to quote them as though that their word
[1:37:34] is in stone and this and that you know
[1:37:36] it they're nothing but a bunch of liars
[1:37:39] they can't help but it's a spirit that's
[1:37:40] on them
[1:37:42] it's a spirit upon this nation of
[1:37:44] falsehood
[1:37:44] [Music]
[1:37:46] and yet you wouldn't quote them and yet
[1:37:48] you'll quote the father of Lies
[1:37:53] will dwell upon him I'm not shaming you
[1:37:56] I'm trying to get you to see friends you
[1:37:58] wouldn't even quote somebody out there
[1:38:00] but yet you'll entertain those things
[1:38:02] you know why we'll do it it's because it
[1:38:05] seems like it's truth but you've got to
[1:38:08] realize there's a time when facts are
[1:38:10] not the truth
[1:38:14] are you with me the fact was Goliath was
[1:38:17] out
[1:38:17] in as far as physically he outmatched
[1:38:20] David that was a fact
[1:38:22] but the truth was
[1:38:24] God what's with David
[1:38:25] [Music]
[1:38:27] when they came to the promised land
[1:38:29] facts were the laws were big the walls
[1:38:33] were strong absolutely they were
[1:38:35] outmatched these people were Fighters
[1:38:37] those are facts but the truth is God Is
[1:38:40] With Us
[1:38:42] you need with why we must have the word
[1:38:45] of God the person of Truth to separate
[1:38:49] facts from truth
[1:38:52] or by the time you don't know what I'm
[1:38:53] bound with that's a fact but the truth
[1:38:55] is
[1:38:56] you are a son and daughter of God the
[1:38:59] truth is he paid the ultimate price for
[1:39:02] you
[1:39:04] truth is he shed his blood for you
[1:39:06] that's the truth the facts of your life
[1:39:10] right now mean nothing
[1:39:12] in terms of the truth it might be a fact
[1:39:15] I'm bound with this or I'm bound with
[1:39:17] that or I'm bound with that that might
[1:39:18] be facts but the truth is he
[1:39:21] whom the son is set free is free indeed
[1:39:25] what matters is the truth not your facts
[1:39:30] are you hearing me
[1:39:31] for my thoughts are not your thoughts
[1:39:33] neither are your ways my ways saith the
[1:39:35] Lord Jeremiah 29 11 for I know the
[1:39:38] thoughts that I think toward you saith
[1:39:40] the Lord thoughts of peace and not of
[1:39:43] evil
[1:39:44] to give you an expected end
[1:39:48] well brother Sammy I've had this started
[1:39:49] it's going to seem like I'm going to be
[1:39:51] able to make it that didn't come from
[1:39:52] God
[1:39:55] that didn't come from God
[1:39:59] I know you know sometimes we because we
[1:40:01] talk about the mind so much
[1:40:03] and yet sometimes we act as though that
[1:40:05] well I'll just say we maybe in general
[1:40:06] maybe you don't maybe you're beyond that
[1:40:08] but I find this that we still deal with
[1:40:10] this same principle over and over that
[1:40:12] sometimes we can disregard the mind as
[1:40:14] though when it the mind don't matter
[1:40:16] nothing at all you don't need nothing to
[1:40:17] do with the mind what you really need is
[1:40:18] the New Birth the new birth does not
[1:40:20] bypass the mind
[1:40:24] when he first came to Mary she was
[1:40:26] troubled in her mind the Bible said
[1:40:28] troubled means cast doubt how can this
[1:40:31] be
[1:40:32] but what did he do the word kept
[1:40:35] dismantling
[1:40:37] all of that that was there the word
[1:40:39] never came to her and said well I'm
[1:40:41] surprised at you you know you've read
[1:40:42] the message all these years you've said
[1:40:44] in a message Church all these years look
[1:40:47] at you all these years wow that have
[1:40:49] been encouraging wouldn't it
[1:40:51] I don't really loosened her up wouldn't
[1:40:53] it it tightened her up matter of fact
[1:40:54] she may not have even stayed there
[1:40:56] it has shamed her that he wanted God
[1:40:59] God's not interested in shame in people
[1:41:00] come on friends God don't want to guilt
[1:41:03] you into serving him
[1:41:05] I know there's a lot of movies sometimes
[1:41:07] it's made in oh my this passion and oh
[1:41:10] my it just made me now I'm not saying
[1:41:12] God can deal and sometimes God can get a
[1:41:14] hold of people's lives and they'll walk
[1:41:16] on from those things that's not what I'm
[1:41:17] saying I'm saying he can do that but
[1:41:19] sometimes listen God's not trying to
[1:41:21] guilt you like I try to make brother
[1:41:23] Joshua feel bad because he's not here
[1:41:25] early and getting chairs set out and
[1:41:27] doing this and I try to guilt him into
[1:41:30] it it's not in his heart
[1:41:32] you can't guilty if you're guilt him
[1:41:34] it'd be like somebody saying you know
[1:41:35] you ought to go call your grandma you
[1:41:36] really want to call your grandma you got
[1:41:37] to call your grandma you know your
[1:41:38] grandma's trying to shame on you man you
[1:41:39] gotta turn on your ground what's the
[1:41:40] last time you talk to Grandma don't you
[1:41:41] love your grandma come on buddy don't
[1:41:43] you that's called guilting
[1:41:45] guilty and guess what Grandma knows
[1:41:47] you've been guilted into it
[1:41:52] us into serving him
[1:41:54] he wants us to serve him
[1:41:56] because we love him
[1:41:59] so if you're feeling well I'm feeling
[1:42:00] guilted you've got the wrong feeling
[1:42:02] forsake it let that feeling go and
[1:42:05] realize the love of God is not come to
[1:42:07] guilt you the love of God is called to
[1:42:09] draw you
[1:42:12] aren't you glad for that
[1:42:14] it's what brother Adam says it must be
[1:42:16] talking about the word it must be
[1:42:17] accepted in the mind then it's believed
[1:42:21] with the heart then the word of God
[1:42:23] becomes a reality then every sense of
[1:42:27] soul and body is just scoured out with
[1:42:30] the Holy Spirit then your sense of God
[1:42:33] your conscience of God everything that's
[1:42:35] Godly flows through you there's not a
[1:42:37] doubt anywhere there's nothing
[1:42:40] can rise up
[1:42:43] he goes on to say
[1:42:44] if you'll come and you'll keep their
[1:42:47] memories and conscience and everything
[1:42:50] thinking about it
[1:42:53] well I might fail
[1:42:56] it might not be right
[1:42:58] don't you do that at all
[1:43:01] let's say how in the world does this
[1:43:02] have to deal with humility do you
[1:43:05] understand where this even starts with
[1:43:07] you letting God's thoughts have first
[1:43:09] place over your own thoughts
[1:43:12] you'll never get to first base without
[1:43:15] this this is for everything in life's
[1:43:18] journey
[1:43:19] God deals with our life
[1:43:21] so that our thoughts might be let go of
[1:43:24] and sometimes we're almost like the guys
[1:43:25] you know that are 15 years old still
[1:43:27] sleeping with teddy bears we're holding
[1:43:28] on to it I've been sleeping with this so
[1:43:30] long I know I don't have a nose on I
[1:43:32] don't have an eye on it I know I've been
[1:43:33] I've been with it so long but you can't
[1:43:34] take this I I'm going to take it to
[1:43:36] college but I'll hide it under the
[1:43:37] blanket and I won't let nobody see it
[1:43:39] we've had it for so long it's become
[1:43:41] almost a security blanket
[1:43:43] there's things about our lives we've
[1:43:46] held on to that God said you don't have
[1:43:48] to hold on to it any longer
[1:43:51] you don't need a teddy bear I am your
[1:43:53] culture
[1:43:55] come down to dwell with you and to walk
[1:43:57] with you as a matter of fact I will be
[1:43:59] your friend and we'll stick closer than
[1:44:02] a brother
[1:44:06] and he could say I'm not ashamed to be
[1:44:09] identified with you I'm not ashamed to
[1:44:11] walk with you but Lord You're Still
[1:44:14] these things are still being worked out
[1:44:15] my life I know and the only reason
[1:44:17] they're worked out because I'm walking
[1:44:18] with you
[1:44:19] I'm not ashamed I'm gonna keep walking
[1:44:21] with you Lord will you lead me to
[1:44:23] humbling you all the way into surrender
[1:44:25] but just stay with me let's just keep
[1:44:26] putting Footsteps in front of footsteps
[1:44:28] in front but that's the goal yeah but
[1:44:29] we're going to get there not by jumping
[1:44:31] not by skipping not by hopping not by
[1:44:32] Rolling step by step by step by step by
[1:44:35] step by step by step
[1:44:40] you throw aside everything
[1:44:43] and open up the channel
[1:44:46] Lord I tell you I went by through as I
[1:44:49] drove through Lorraine over the past few
[1:44:50] weeks brother Joy I mean I've seen a lot
[1:44:52] of stuff out on the curves even where I
[1:44:54] live I said man I mean to tell you I've
[1:44:56] seen people it just broke my heart
[1:44:57] coming home from the office there a few
[1:44:59] weeks ago and I seen these people they
[1:45:00] must have been well into their 60s I
[1:45:02] just felt my heart just broke for him
[1:45:03] their whole driveway was filled up and I
[1:45:05] knew that all come out of the basement
[1:45:08] and to think about how that within this
[1:45:11] right here of God would speak to our
[1:45:15] lives to throw everything else aside
[1:45:19] to empty it up
[1:45:22] oh God help us
[1:45:24] is that what you want this morning
[1:45:26] that's what I want everyone else throw
[1:45:29] aside everything and open up the channel
[1:45:31] and say this is important and say God
[1:45:35] your word is eternally true and it's for
[1:45:38] me
[1:45:39] not just its return eternally true but
[1:45:42] it's for me
[1:45:43] it's for me
[1:45:45] if the whole church fails if the whole
[1:45:49] world fails yet I can't fail because I'm
[1:45:54] taking your word
[1:45:57] Bears your battle
[1:46:03] can I go one more point
[1:46:07] in Exodus 3
[1:46:09] .
[1:46:10] verse four and five
[1:46:13] God comes here's Moses standing here
[1:46:16] Moses here just a great example of this
[1:46:19] Moses has known of the promise of God
[1:46:21] known of God
[1:46:23] that here he comes after these 40 years
[1:46:27] of tending sheep
[1:46:30] and here he turns aside brother Aaron on
[1:46:33] a familiar path he's walked before I
[1:46:35] mean he's walked this path he knows it
[1:46:37] he don't need GPS he can find his way
[1:46:39] out of the woods he knows his path this
[1:46:42] tree that tree all that stone that no he
[1:46:43] knows it he's walked it
[1:46:45] but isn't it something how God comes
[1:46:47] where fat paths that we've walked that
[1:46:50] are familiar to us but when he comes
[1:46:53] it becomes more than a familiar moment
[1:46:58] God wasn't worried about oh I got to put
[1:47:00] this billboard down here I got to do
[1:47:02] this I got to put arrows going like this
[1:47:03] God just moved down
[1:47:06] in his presence
[1:47:09] and Moses caught sight
[1:47:12] of a bush
[1:47:14] that burned yeah it wasn't consumed
[1:47:19] it just arose his curiosity but the
[1:47:21] Curiosity was is that on the inside
[1:47:23] something was rising up
[1:47:26] I must turn aside and see this it
[1:47:29] started with him
[1:47:30] turning aside
[1:47:32] and getting off of that path
[1:47:34] that he had been walking on
[1:47:37] because that path he had walked a long
[1:47:39] time
[1:47:39] and when he got off that path
[1:47:42] he came up in God's presence
[1:47:45] and the Lord said put off
[1:47:49] thy shoes
[1:47:51] for the place you're standing
[1:47:53] is Holy Ground
[1:47:55] this word to put off think of it God
[1:47:59] never asked him you know how brother
[1:48:00] Bram will dramatized this God never
[1:48:02] asked him what do you think you need to
[1:48:04] put off Moses
[1:48:06] what do you think well Lord I think I
[1:48:09] could give this up I mean it's kind of
[1:48:10] like you know people giving to charity
[1:48:12] they never give their favorite shirt to
[1:48:13] charity
[1:48:15] right
[1:48:17] or they'll never do this
[1:48:19] they give things that they no longer
[1:48:22] want right
[1:48:27] well you know I'm hitting it
[1:48:30] we we don't give away the things that we
[1:48:32] want
[1:48:33] right we've got the certain kind of
[1:48:35] donuts that we like we make sure
[1:48:38] [Laughter]
[1:48:41] giving away Secrets now I don't do that
[1:48:44] I said get down flesh
[1:48:49] oh Jesus
[1:48:51] put off that shoes from off that feet he
[1:48:54] didn't ask him
[1:48:55] Moses what if Moses would have said Lord
[1:48:57] I'll tell you what I do I'll take off my
[1:48:58] hat
[1:48:59] anyone asked
[1:49:02] but to put off think of what this word
[1:49:04] put off means this just started early
[1:49:06] this morning just started striking me to
[1:49:08] put means to slip off drop off clear
[1:49:11] away to clear out completely
[1:49:14] clear entirely
[1:49:19] well Joshua he had to unloosen them
[1:49:24] and take them off it wasn't just enough
[1:49:27] just to unloosen
[1:49:30] now I know I got slip-ons
[1:49:32] these are lazy man shoes I'm not lazy I
[1:49:34] just don't like timeline but
[1:49:36] these things here and I don't like them
[1:49:38] when they come untied when I'm preaching
[1:49:39] so that's why I wear them
[1:49:40] but he had to unloosen them
[1:49:42] now let me ask you this question
[1:49:44] why did God have him take his shoes off
[1:49:50] brother Bram tells us he said because
[1:49:52] God could tell him now I got you
[1:49:54] standing on ground now
[1:49:57] got you out of your shoes
[1:49:59] your ways
[1:50:01] your thinking that's right that's right
[1:50:03] I got you out of it and I've got you
[1:50:05] standing on ground right now
[1:50:08] Moses
[1:50:10] had been stripped for 40 years
[1:50:13] and now in the presence of God he
[1:50:16] realized
[1:50:18] can't do
[1:50:19] what God is calling me to do and I know
[1:50:21] I'm called to do it but I can't do it
[1:50:24] God said you're right where I want you
[1:50:29] let me just close with on this
[1:50:32] that very word to loose
[1:50:36] the Bible in the book of Acts Brianna if
[1:50:39] you find that acts chapter 7 it's down
[1:50:41] there somewhere
[1:50:43] this same scripture is quoted
[1:50:48] put off
[1:50:49] thy shoes from off thy feet for the
[1:50:52] place where thou stand is is Holy Grail
[1:50:55] it was an invitation to Humble himself
[1:50:59] in the presence of God
[1:51:01] because God was going to exalt
[1:51:04] the son
[1:51:06] of promise
[1:51:08] the son
[1:51:09] that which God thought when he spoke
[1:51:12] that word
[1:51:13] but God had to get him to where he got
[1:51:16] out of his shoes
[1:51:17] got out of his thoughts
[1:51:19] and this whole word put off right here
[1:51:21] my
[1:51:24] this in the Greek
[1:51:26] it means like things that have been
[1:51:28] compacted together
[1:51:30] and so interwoven so tightly
[1:51:33] you know there's things sometimes I know
[1:51:36] there's fishermen sitting here
[1:51:38] some of us that want to be
[1:51:41] do you know how it is
[1:51:43] listen your fishing line gets tired
[1:51:44] tangled up we know how it is you can
[1:51:47] spend all day out there on the boat
[1:51:48] trying to get it untangled right or you
[1:51:50] can just go hammer them pliers
[1:51:53] snip
[1:51:54] let it go is that right
[1:51:57] snip Let It Go
[1:51:59] let's get another one we'll string this
[1:52:00] up again I can't untangle it everybody
[1:52:03] knows what it is it's always that joke
[1:52:04] about you look like you're trying to
[1:52:05] untangle fishing line
[1:52:08] let me just tell you something
[1:52:10] there ain't nothing not one of us
[1:52:13] can untangle and could untangle Our
[1:52:16] Lives
[1:52:18] all the complexities of things that's
[1:52:20] been down through there but God
[1:52:22] this word put off right here in the
[1:52:24] Greek you see that first beginning up
[1:52:26] there l-u-o Louisville it's the
[1:52:29] beginning of the word that we know as
[1:52:31] Lutron which is washing of water
[1:52:35] by the word
[1:52:37] how does God loosen up
[1:52:41] these things were so intricately
[1:52:44] tied together in our life but Samuel
[1:52:47] even after we've been born again oh yeah
[1:52:49] God's still working on us he's still
[1:52:51] working on us what's he doing by his
[1:52:53] word he's washing us by the water of the
[1:52:57] word to do what he's loosening up it's
[1:52:59] like if you're dirty what do you do if
[1:53:01] you're dirty you go get some water
[1:53:03] why do you get the soap I want to smell
[1:53:06] good that ain't why you use soap I know
[1:53:07] they put the good fragrances in them but
[1:53:09] you use soap to do what lather up and
[1:53:12] bring something that'll loosen it and
[1:53:14] allow the water to wash away the dirt
[1:53:17] and there ain't nothing like the washing
[1:53:19] of Water by the word something that gets
[1:53:22] right down in there between us and what
[1:53:24] we think is us and the word said that
[1:53:26] ain't you that ain't you because that
[1:53:29] ain't me and you are me that ain't that
[1:53:31] ain't us so what does the word do the
[1:53:33] word gets right down in there to where
[1:53:35] you and I can separate we separate to
[1:53:38] that of the word and the washing of
[1:53:41] Water by the word just
[1:53:44] washes it all away
[1:53:48] true don't you love him amen what's he
[1:53:51] doing
[1:53:52] he's doing
[1:53:54] what only he can do
[1:53:55] we are his
[1:53:58] workmanship
[1:54:00] he's washing us
[1:54:02] little by little it's not me saying come
[1:54:04] on brother Joshua come on man come on

[1:54:37] comes say I take the word forget my

[1:54:46] take that
[1:54:47] oh brother Sammy you don't want people
[1:54:48] yeah I want you to live by the word
[1:54:50] because when the word comes in you let
