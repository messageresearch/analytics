need and we'll be careful to give you all the praise for it and the lovely name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen god bless y'all good to see you be back in this side of the world in a while trying to figure out what it was and well I got old sin sin so I forgot and so glad sister Kim and brother Samuel got to come out and see me there so we was happy to have him last this last June and we had a wonderful time and there was real blessing to us and we just appreciate you letting them come out our way on the old dry climate you know he needed some of this moisture and then to make it over our way praise the Lord bring you greetings from the Saints down Beaufort South Carolina and also from the Saints out española New Mexico we kind of dual residence right now just Lord keep us on the road most of the time about about of it I guess we're we're try residents today we're resident here so we're we're Ohioans today and and was Canadians yesterday so you just never know where you're liable to find us in this evangelistic journey appreciate the singers and the musicians and as if you have your Bibles they'd like you to go with me over in the Book of Micah and bit of a strange little text but it's been a real blessing to me as I've studied these things and and we get bit of a different situation we get opportunity to speak two times to the same group of people we don't get that very often so usually it's just in today and out tomorrow so we get to hang around and preach again on Sunday so that's at least at this point that's the way it is with the Lord willing and you know we might get the word that we didn't do such a good job tonight and then they have to send us on down the road you know and tell us to go back where we come from so but we'll do our very best to be a blessing to the bride of Jesus Christ here in Micah it's a bit of background on this I I don't know how you all are with with Old Testament especially in the minor prophets they were a little there they are still even a bit intimidating for me to read because there's so much out that I don't understand and so much of it that that brother branham didn't deal with and for my sake if he didn't deal with that I'm pretty much ignorant and so but and so sometimes you know you just have to wait and and so as I was feeling like the Lord led me over here and I was reading and so I had to pray before I read it because many of the things in Micah are historic they have already happened there it's already fulfilled prophecy and then there's other things in there that make absolutely no sense whatsoever to me as just as a 21st century Gentile gospel preacher I don't I don't it doesn't you know I don't have that kind of an education I suppose and so we just have to pray and you just pray Lord along the way as we read these things then if you give us if you're quicken it to us and and so then there's we have a lot of tools and things that are on our disposal different commentaries and Bible you know search engines and all kinds of you know you know commentaries and things that we can that we can use this as study guides but ultimately they were not prophetic they were just you know the origins and things and so we're thankful that God sent us a prophet in the last days so he could come and tie up all the loose ends of all those things that they left undone and so some of the things that they said was was good material it was good it was good it was a it was as it were a good rope amen and but the Prophet had to tie up the loose parts and that's what we're so thankful for and so as I come into the Book of Micah needless to say there was some of those things that I was able to understand and read commentaries and kind of get some some bearing on it but ultimately there's still a lot of it that it's got big holes as far as my understanding but I came to this one verse of scripture and it was like it just jumped off the page and I liked it when it happens like that and I didn't altogether know exactly what I was reading but I knew that the Lord was in it and so we was able to just pray and and and I read a couple of things and then I began to see something there and it's just really been enlightening and helpful to me so hopefully it'll be the same for you I want to begin reading at verse 12 of chapter 2 Micah chapter 2 and we begin reading at verse 12 Micah here the the prophet we realized that he was a poor man like amos but he was a contemporary with isaiah and so isaiah prophesied with the among the very affluent and the wealth and dignitaries and kings of that time he was isaiah was a friend of the king uzziah and at the same time that he was prophesying or at least to a different group of people different class of people will you had this man Micah and so Micah comes here in verse 12 and he says I will surely assemble Oh Jacob all of thee I will surely gather the remnant of is I will put them together as the sheep of Borgia as the flock in the midst of their fold they shall make great noise by reason of the multitude of men the breaker is come up before them they have broken up and have passed through the gate and are gone out by it and their king shall pass before them and the Lord on the head of them may the Lord bless the reading of the word this evening as you have your seats would like to take my text out of the 13th verse there it says the breaker is come up and I'd like to title the message this evening the breaker my studies I found that this one of those commentators spiros Oh deities he's a Greek theologian and he was a it was a Bible scholar and it was actually the editor of my Study Bible and he makes a statement there that the breaker which really means the one who breaks open is a reference to Israel's Messiah and so then as we we we now have put a title here the breaker that this word breaker actually should be capitalized in your Bible there and senator the lowercase but it should be capitalized you can go in other places in the Bible where it speaks of the branch and they capitalized that and and different places like that throughout the the rod of Jesse and they capitalized that and and different places through the Bible then it speaks of them and gives title to the Messiah and they would capitalize it here they fail to do so but I believe that we have that because if it's a if it's a person place or a thing according to the last time I was in English class which is well it wasn't really quite your business and was a long time ago we knew that a person place or a thing but if it was a proper noun it had to be if it dealt with the name of a person or a place then it had to be capitalized so we can say here that this the breaker if it was referencing the Messiah then we would surely want to capitalize it he meant and so here this breaker has come up and so as we look at this fellow we find that he is one who breaks open one who from the New International Version the Bible says the one who breaks open the way will go before them and they will break through the gate and go out they will amen so we have this one that would lead the way that would break open or break through and there would be some that would go through with him the king which the king and the breaker are synonymous to each other that their king would pass through before him the Lord at their head so this this brick her this one that was going forth or the one that would burst out and it actually speaks of the one who would break forth from the womb and so we see that that this is a very type of the Lord Jesus that that he broke through from the wound amen that he was that he was one prophesied that a virgin would conceive and she would bear a son and this son would break forth and we realized that this word is um the the Hebrew word is the word is I think I haven't written here yes it's Forres @ph Oh are easy which is if you'll have your Bible scholars you'll understand that that's close to feriss ferriss as though as the twin brother that was born of Tamar I believe it was and that he put his hand forth before his brother and they tied a scarlet thread around it so he broke forth they met and so they named him Farrah's and so this word the breaker here is Forres or the one who breaks forth from the womb the one who would break through or break down that would make a breach or to break into to break open hallelujah - to break up and to break into pieces to break out violently upon as though like a plague in the days of David we need when he called for the the mercies of God rather than the wrath of man and so that he but uh but of the the plague broke out and on the people it was violent it was a violent breaking out upon the people and then finally it means to break over as in the limits and so when when the cup would get to the very top and as it would get to that you know however if your watch there the water when it gets to the milk came and when it gets to the top of the glass it kind of looks like it goes up a little bit further than the top now they call that that gripping around the the seal of them other of the the mouth of the jar the the glass there and you kind of mounds up a little it kind of and your way home I put too much milk in there and and so that's when you get down and sort of put off there right quick before it runs all over the place well that little mounding up there is what they call it it's capillary action is the actual scientific term of it but it's it's gripping it's it's it's it's attracted to it but then finally gravity takes over and it breaks forth and it goes all over the counter and all over moms forward there you go and so so it's a breaking over or when you go past the limit ie speed limits things like that sound barriers speedling those barriers that there that are there so we we see that this is this breaker that we're speaking of we find that the scripture actually speaks of one that would actually come before him he said I'll send you the messenger before me and it speaks of John the Baptist the forerunner of Christ and he was under the spirit of Elijah and he was to come he was to break or to prepare once and they would actually go where there was no trail there was no road there was no passage there before and these men would survey the land and try to make the most direct route that they could find and so they would survey the land to build a railroad or whatever it might be and they were the they were the Trailblazers these were the ones that that actually surveyed the way across from the east coast to the west coast what we find that that's the the arm the purpose of John the Baptist was to clear the way and it speaks of the one that would make way for the for the Lord and he would and it speaks of an of an oriental custom of how that they would send men before to kick the rocks and the logs and everything out when the king was riding on his coach they would fill in the holes and they would they would they would you know cut down the humps and whatever so his chariot would ride smoothly and these were the ones that were the breakers that went before Oh hallelujah if you help me a little bit we'll breach here and so John the Baptist was one that cleared the way for Christ by his doctrine and by his baptism Malachi 3 from the New Living Translation I like this he says look I am the mess I am sending my messenger and he will prepare the way before me then the Lord you are seeking will suddenly come to his temple the messenger of the Covenant whom you looked for so eagerly is surely coming says the Lord of heavens armies hey man Oh hallelujah it was the Lord of hosts hey man his armies were coming with him and he was going to go on before them the Bible says amen and their King and their Lord would be at their head we find that up in the North Country in the Arctic Circle I've been up along the Bering Straits and up along in there and those those typically salt water doesn't freeze but because the land it's so cold up in the in the Arctic Circle and then also in the Antarctic as well that this water actually separates and it freezes and it becomes very thick but yet they have to have passage into certain villages and so forth and and so what they have to have is they have to have a specially-designed ship amen and this ship is called an icebreaker it has a special hull that is a reinforce they meant it has a special engine amen this dynamo that's inside of it well it's got an it's got a super power amen it's not really designed for anything other than to make away amen hey so that the ship coming behind it that is bearing the precious cargo would it be able to make a way into the village or into the place Oh mine so God sent and Elijah prophet in the days of the Lord to make way for the Lord to prepare the way before him why because there was coming a ship after him hey man who was bearing precious cargo that way before him hallelujah oh I'm so glad for this icebreaker amen he come in the spirit of Elijah amen to make way for the Christ amen we find that Christ Himself is also best represented as this breaker because he broke through from the world hey man he broke through from the world to identify himself as the virgin born son of God but we find that he also he began to break through the Judeo systems in the law had he been to break through through insanity and sickness and diseases all he broke through Haven in through his personal ministry we find that he was then he was betrayed of his familiar friend and he was crucified but the Bible says Amen Jesus of himself since highly my life tailed and I will pick it back up again hey then hold on he said you put me in the term but in three days how rise again hey hey man oh why because he was he was lord over heaven and earth he wasn't Lord of the living amen and he was Lord of the day why nothing could hold him and we find on Easter morning oh my he broke out at the rising of the Sun this tomb couldn't hold him death couldn't hold take over man we find that this this action of his breaking forth from the tomb that he broke through and vanquished all enemies Bible says that he conquered death he conquered sin he conquered sickness he conquered hell and he conquered the grave amen the Bible says that he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men hey man and he that descent he that I sent at first descended he went down and broke through amen the doors of hell huh hey man he went down there he went there for a reason and that was to deposit all of my mistakes all of my sins all of my parts and failures he took them down there and put on all the devil's doorstep hey man and then he came out and he broke through paradise and he led captivity captive amen oh my he went all the way up into Heaven's heaven and he broke into heaven hallelujah oh my he went up there and said lift up your gates the everlasting gates and let the King of glory come in hey Danny come leading the way into heaven's gates amen we find that he he broke through all the troops of hell oh that brother man said they had a conference down in hell oh I'm so glad we had a prophet in our day that had the ability to look into hell and listen in how the devil's conversation had hey man in the devil said he spoke to death he said we've got to stop him we've got that we've got to end this now you've got to end his ministry right now because if you don't were finished amen oh my he knew that he had to he had to he had to stop this virgin born son of God but we find that brother branham tells us that there was a man in the sky believe it was in Switzerland by the name of Arnold Van Winkle Reid and Arnold knew that they couldn't defend themselves against the German army but he's had with this day I give my life for my own countrymen and he ran into the thickest part of the spears and he embraced the spears and said make way for liberty hallelujah the man said we had one a man named the Lord Jesus Christ who ran into the thickest spears of death and hell and he embraced them and said make way her for Adams race hallelujah he said now come on boys let's try to drive him to the fighting walls Haven because Christ has gone before us and has broke through amen to heavens Joy's and endless days he broke through all difficulties Amen that lay in the way of the salvation of his people there was so much in the way but he kicked all the roadblocks out he rolled all the big stones out all so that you and I we would have all let me tell you friends one day the Lord Jesus was hanging there above the above the earth and beneath the heaven heaven couldn't receive him because he bore the sins of the world heaven didn't want are held in warning Amen because hey man he was a virgin born son of God also there he hung between heaven and earth while there he was beaten beyond human recognition he had bled out oh he was dehydrated he was dying of hypothermia oh he was he was he was he would had blood loss sleep deprivation all all these things were upon him blunt-force trauma all the medical things that were upon him he was hanging there but right at the right at the precipice of life and death and as he's hanging there between malefactors there is one on his right amen and the one on his right said he was he said he started praying he said Lord when you come into your kingdom remember me no not you had thought that the Lord Jesus at the weakest moment of his earthly ministry at the very weakest at the very frailest at the very point of death he would have thought that he said just can't you let me die in peace can't you just let me just finish my course is it good is it too much to ask just to let me alone oh but let me tell you huh hey buddy you looked over to that pay for the ride hey man oh Jesus and and he brought that man who was at the Greek of Hell at the brink of death and any in his weakest moment that his frailest moment is a mortal on the earth I've been hanging there Oh amen he told that young man he says this day you'll be with me in paradise think about it kid if he do that then at his weakest moment what can he do for you even here to narrate as a mighty Conqueror when he conquered 70 know as the brake car ended up the one who is broken sleep oh that's right Jesus that's what I'm talking about yeah Alleluia brother Brendan makes a statement oh he said he bore his children upon his shoulders because it was the strongest part of his body they bore the children on his shoulders but with his finger the Lord I'm talking about the one a man who has your soul in his care the one has had a man that no man can you take you away from me aim at all that the father is giving me they will come to me and I won't lose a one-up oh but he gets rid of Devils with his finger but he bears you on his shoulders or into God a man he broke down the middle wall of partition but the ceremonial law between Jew and Gentile they rent the veil all about how to run away brother I was just riding the tube and it wasn't even in this pattern of songs that he sang this evening I wrote down the tomb he goes the term now is empty huh oh you think god I need control either way just win in the Easter morning huh now what right what about that on I just couldn't leave it I said there it is he broke off the yoke of sin and Satan under the hall set them at liberty and that was his resurrection he broke us under the cords of death the watchman brother mem says he says then then when he died for our sins come through the way of paradise and taken the waiting souls and broke through every spiritual power that the devil had bound the earth with and made a streak so that the sunlight of God's eternal grace could shine upon those who were willing to receive it oh there was an age of darkness it was called the seventh age it was called Laodicea amen it was it was called the days of Sodom and Gomorrah it was called the days of Noah amen it was the day that we live in amen and the Lord Jesus Christ made a streak amen so that light could shine into our age and so that those Amen that they could receive eternal grace amen and so that that light would shine upon those who are willing to receive it so glad for that this evening we find that he was the breaker according to the scripture of stony hearts oh we're talking about our hearts our lives the Bible says that he would take away amen at a heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh amen brother that said the reason that he done that is so that you can even get along with yourself huh think about that so ornery you can't even along with yourself but he said he'll break the stony heart hallelujah he would come and give you a heart of flesh he said then I will give you my spirit hallelujah oh my and so here it is to break these stony hearts sometimes we get so hard in our spirits we become spiritually calcified amen in calais so to the point that we can't even be moved by the moving of the holy gold hold that I say God come and break this old stony heart come and make me a heart of flesh maybe somebody that can be sensitive to the moving of the spirit break away all this crust oh let me be that eagle amen and find a stone of Revelation and begin to beat my head a minute until I get all the world and everything broken off so I can set my wings amen to the wings of the wind the scripture says to break up the fallow ground well if we're not farmers then that probably doesn't mean a whole lot to you but what fallow ground is is that you come in in the wintertime and you set your Ripper's real deep and you go through and you break up the deep the ground real deep and you leave it broke up so that the frost can get down because the frost will get down below what you broke break up in this country up to three feet deep and when it does that ice will get down into that ground and when it thaws it an ice expands the dirt and it breaks it even deeper so you can actually a magnified benefit that once you've broken the ground then the frost will actually give you an additional so many feet of broken earth and the reason they do that is so that the so that it will retain water so it will fluff the earth up so you can have a good ground to plant the seat but we find that as I have they broken that all up and they come back through maybe the next year they don't plant but what they'll do is they'll go over that that of that busted soil act that and they'll run what they call a hero and a heroine all the dirt clods and fill in all the gaps and everything and make a nice level field out there but but now that ground is what they call fallow in other words it's ground that's been plowed and left gold for a year but it's unimproved n't bow if your spiritual this evening amen so what we find that many times is that as that we've been plowed we've set in church we had come under the effect of trials and tribulation and it's an added benefit the Bible says to that count it all joy amen so it's joy to go through trials even though we don't enjoy it but yet it has it's it's its effect on us but then you know so then after a little while we sit in church and it gets all leveled off in there and it's all been leveled down and Herald out and oh we're just we're just a beautiful field of church members oh my oh we got our church order in man down pat we're just oh we're just a beautiful field but it's unimpressive it's never had a crop sown in it and so the Bible then comes back and says hey you've got to go break up the fallow ground now you've got to go through and you've got to put it in wind rows you got to come through there and plant the seed in it you've got to drill the seed into the soil and and and rake this he did otherwise it's just a dirt field brother Graham said eventually he said it'll just be a patch of weeds he said there you go a bunch of this is his words not mine a bunch a world record weeds I have never seen a weed competition at the fair if they had some I believe I could win that competition because out where I live in New Mexico we grow some big old tumbleweeds bigger this desk here oh they're a beautiful thing absolutely worthless cows won't even eat all they do is roll around not my fences dinner but all there's a week oh my and that's where a lot of a lot of us get to we're just world record weeds hold that we need to tear up the fallow ground we need that have the breaker the country and showing us seeds of righteousness seeds of joy and peace maybe that we could bring forth fruit in our season hallelujah he is a chain breaker hallelujah chains of bondage bondage of spiritual unbelief the Bible says that they would have a form of godliness but denying the power thereof those chains need to be broken off of God's people there they have a form of godliness they come to church set on the Pew pay their tithe check the preachers hand that's all well and good we appreciate that but it's never going to get you into heaven or but we need a chain breaker to come to break the chains of spiritual unbelief we need a chain breaker to come and break the chains of our own thoughts the Bible says lean not to your own understanding so many times we think we just gotta outsmart the the preacher we gotta outsmart the pastor we gotta outsmart the prophet so many times people wonder well brother baron admit this and brother in a minute then well I just ain't got that smart yet I'm sorry I just want to say what he said and say it the way he said it and we'll put words in his mouth break the chains of tradition jesus said you by your traditions make the Word of God of none effect people become so bound in tradition they've become so traditional in their ways brother man said we need to get out of church order long enough to get somebody saved oh man I think there ought to be you know there ought to be shouting there ought to be running the house and speaking in tongues and glorifying God in the Church of the Living God in this hour that we live in but we get so bound down in our tradition then you've got the other side of it that says you didn't even have a church service unless somebody speaks in tongues and then all they do is just speak in tongues they got identified but nobody else did barbarians Bible says so then we come break the chains of death spiritual death the Bible says he that liveth in pleasure is dead wow she liveth even that's not just the sisters that's that's the church amen all they're so wound up in there and they're in their entertainments and their sports and all their fashions and all these other kind of things they're so caught up in those things to where the very fact that they can't even let them that their their hearts become calloused and condemn them and so that they can't even have a move of God in their hearts oh but my Bible says that even the dead heard the Sun of golf we may break the chains of death natural death he meant so many times we've heard him oh well you're gonna die you've got this disease or you got that disease I don't have to accept that I'm gonna break the chains of death you know but I said we don't fear cancer we don't fear heart and diabetes and all these other kind of thing we don't fear those things though we hey we might die that tomorrow I don't know but I'm not afraid of it amen the chains of death and hell have been broken when he said it's finished when he said it's finished it was finished he breaks he's the breaker tonight and he breaks cycles family cycles there's so many times that families have these inherent behaviors that will handed down brother never said you've got that anger from your own core you got that you've got that spirit like that of a critical he said some of you talked about that boy that he that his mother was a German and his father was an Irishman poor fella you know and so he had one attribute that was from his mother that he that he was just uh I believe he was some about reading reserved and that he there was something bad that he that he wasn't ever he something some about that he that he went back on the on his engagement with a girl that's what brought the whole thing up and then the other side of it was his father's side I believe was that he was he was an Irishman start getting real angry and he said but our son is it was raised in church but then said that doesn't have anything to do with it he said he's got to be born again that's the only thing that will break those family cycles country cycles real instead of the United States was a haha and Germany was all in order and and and and in other countries Heather all the way talk about the Canadians being a very reserved and very formal they ever tell you not all Canadians are that way the Lord's broke some chains we was in a Canadian church this last weekend had a glory time it got well it got out of hand I'm telling you it was good we had church we had altar call and people got delivered and set free and hey man they got the screaming and shouting act like a bunch of Pentecostals and uh well I actually kind of got pretty happy myself so what was it he was a breaker chain breaker a cycle breaker I like this one the Bible says in Book of Daniel that there was a mountain that rose up out of the earth and it speaks of an image and that image for them tells us there was those Gentile ages was in that image had the head of gold that babylonian kings and then went down through the the the medo-persians and then it come down to the greeks and then down into the romans and then it was mixed with iron and clay down at the feet he said that was both Protestantism and Roman ISM there was this image there he said but then this mountain rose up and there was a there was a stone that was cut out without hands he said and that stone came rolling down the mountain and struck the image in the feet oh let me tell you he's an image breaker hallelujah I want you to see something here that that stone brother branham's head he said that stone was Christ and that and watch what he says here when that stone struck the feet he said that's when we go out of here hallelujah or utopic I use a gravity breaker hey bet he's a he the dimension breaker oh hey oh he's going to break through amen these dimension of these earthbound dimensions and go into that next dimension amen were the dead in Christ will rise and he'll come back among us and oh my that will get our body change the Bible said he ascended on high and gave gifts unto men this is from Hebrews there was an atmosphere hung over the earth of darkness of gloom and death and weary and the prayers couldn't come up because the atonement wasn't made but he broke through that veil he opened up the way he broke the veil of sickness broke the veil of sin he broke the veil of weary amen anybody had a had a veil of weary Hunnam oh he broke oh I like this one he broke the veil of depressed Haven that's your prophet friends hey man you feel depressed he broke that veil you don't have to stay that way he broke every veil made a highway for the wayfaring walking up the Kings Highway oh my when he passed the moon in the Stars and on and on he breaks the grip all the grip of Satan that has around us how many times you just feel like he's just got his grip around his throat and you can't get away he's choking you down with there with condemnation and sin and then in the world and lust and all these kind of things he's got you by the throat and you just can't get away he's a great prank her tonight will break the grip of you'll break the grip of sin and sickness Satan and the hardest one is he'll break the grip of self the worst condemnation is self condemnation my Bible says who condemned it was a question does God know he's the one that justifies you he's the one that takes away your sin that forgives you freely forever hallelujah but it's self self you've got yourself in a strangle oh I did this I know I doesn't that no I you know I just can't never you know I've sinned away my day at Grace and all these kind of old men read the word my Bible says he is just and sure to forgive you of your sin if you can pass your sin otherwise the blood of Jesus Christ was without was that without value you cheapen your Redeemer you imagine to cheapen the blood of Christ something so worthless that it couldn't forgive you well let me tell you it's priceless amen is priceless this given for worthlessness I meant because I was without worth but the brother Brad said that he looked upon me and the the purchase of the blood became more valuable than the blood itself he broke barriers oh my brother BAM talks about the the the the this the sound barrier from perseverant but that says and maybe there will be someone with faith enough to break through the barrier yonder that sound barrier that sin barrier that unbelieving barrier break through that to where all things are possible amen oh my I might have told you this story but you've probably got some age on you by now and you forgot and or some of you was little babies back then and you so you don't remember either so if you remember while you was in that sweet spot and you just have to bear with the rest of us but what I took my family to Six Flags Over Texas a big amusement park and because my family for whatever reason had to come from their mother's side they loved to ride them roller coasters and I know it come from their side because I just took here a few years back my wife and my mother-in-law the Universal Studios and they rode roller coasters all day long I'm talking about an old gray-haired grandma needless to say I didn't stay and I just got my fishing boat and I went to the lake and sit out there was nice and calm hey man but anyways so I took them to this here huesemann park and there was a they just kept telling me daddy was right on this you know this Texas giant over here and let's ride the spider-man and let's ride on this make me sick I don't do well and so far I've seen this one said it was a it was a flight simulator where you could break the sound barrier well I've seen that I said man I'll go on that one that's it you know I you know it's just a simulator we can handle that and there was an O dad that's it boring we don't want to go in there and write that I said well have you gonna ride with me you gonna ride this one and so anyways we went over there well it was a line to get in the place and there was already a viewing going on and so we had to stand out on this side while you sat on this side waiting there's a little monitor up there and there's this man comes out there in a red jumpsuit he's a some sort of a pilot or whatever and and so he comes out there and he says he starts telling about the history of flight well I don't think he's reading a message or something you know he's talking about how do they get up to a certain speed and the plane was going to fall apart I don't say that's what the Prophet said yeah I have a limited education and so he's talking about all this things he said he said those early pilots and men of the early days of aeronautics that they would get up to this the speed of about 750 miles an hour and it was like the plane was going to come apart and they would get afraid and they would pull off the throttle because they believed this is what they said this is their their language was that they believed that there was a demon in the sky and there was afraid of that demon well I'm starting to get happy okay he's speaking my language demons and sound barriers and you know all these kind of things and someone say home my brother and so anyways he's uh so he's telling this story and about this this certain pilot I forget his name I should remember it I've studied it many times but I can't remember his name but anyways he got this certain plane and he got up there and out over this I think was a Salt Flats out there and in California and he flew that plane and he broke the sound barrier oh there was a sonic boom and everything and he went out beyond it and he tells a story about it as limited this power and all this man brother you know we got in church all of a sudden and uh and so I'm said that's good that's good that'll preach right there yes sir and so you know I'm gonna go along with that well then then he he capped it off and he should have said this because the screen zooms in on his face and he looks down at us you're fixing to ride on one of the why don't they said fix him probably something like that and he said he said you're about to ride on a state-of-the-art 3d surround blah blah blah and all the technology that was into this simulator and you're going to experience what it's like to go past the speed of sound and and I'm going a men got a witness and then he says do you have what it takes to beat the demon they should have said that oh Jesus I said amen amen well my wife got read my kids started turning around old God you know here's Dada Dada Dada I couldn't help myself if it's so good Oh get me in there oh I wouldn't a philip looking experienced this man and and and and so we went through the whole thing it wasn't all that great but really you know because I mean we experienced all them we never got that far off the ground that's why I'm talking now and it was just a simulator well I needed a stimulator big difference and so so brother Brown takes this and says do you have what it takes to break through that sin barrier well in ourselves we don't in our in myself I don't have the power but he has the power and we pairing that the technology by them said what do you see happening in the natural is what God is doing in the supernatural so if what God if man has broken those sound barriers Haven and God has a way he has a vehicle he has a device that will get you and I beyond that barrier so that everything else is behind us hey man so that we're looking limitless power oh my he says we're told that when a plane passes the sound barrier it's unlimited in its speed and power God if we could break through the power of unbelief miracles and things and promises of God are unlimited for all things are possible to him that believes he breaks through fails he's broken every barrier every veil nothing could hide his presence when people gets hungry in their heart there's a veil ready to be broke you can just depend on that rent every veil by his great holy spirit oh my are you hungry tonight though you just are you just looking for God to come on the scene and break the veils of unbelief break the barriers of sin break the chains of bondage amen to break the grip of Satan he says since the crucifixion when that veil was rent from top to bottom for that generation Jesus was that God veiled when he died at Calvary God sent fire and lightning and ripped that veil from top to bottom that the mercy seat was in plain view but they were too blind to see it as Paul said when Moses is read yet that veil is still on their hearts oh brother sister that's what the Jews did when the veil was rent and brought into plain view hanging on the cross he was in plain view but they couldn't see it could it be possible that the Gentiles has done the same thing Oh God when they've had the church ages the son of God but when ow the veil of denominations and things this veil of tradition that we've got since Pentecost when the church traditions has been rent the things of the the people has said in the days of miracles is past and the things that God has took the veil off of it and brought it into plain view and they're ready to crucify and again just exactly like they did so now we come to a place where brother hams tell us that they had the Church of God that the Son of God through the church agents but then right at the when it was time of restitution has come upon them and the time of the other of the of the the the the comforter that kind of the consolation as Simeon said he was looking for the consolation of Israel and here was Christ had broken the veil of the matrix and had come the child to be circumcised of the eighth day and here comes Simeon honey took that baby in his horns and he said yeah I can depart in peace a man Eric and departed Peaks brother Eamonn why him because Haman I have seen thy salvation what was it it was a changing of the administration's was a changing and so brother Ron says we've had the church the son of God down to the church ages he said but when those denominational systems are condemned huh he said it'll be word and word only he comes over one page later and says I condemn those denominational systems I indict them for the second crucifixion of Christ and so what they didn't recognize what happened when the veil back in the days of the Lord Jesus was writ and the Paschal Lamb was hanging out of the cross and they crucified the Lord of glory or but let me tell you he's breaking through another veil here to the Holy of Holies hallelujah or what is it but the denominational systems haven't seen it they've rejected it but now he's breaking through another veil oh man what was it it was Malachi for look hey man this is from the new living I'm sending you the prophet Elijah before the Great and dreadful day of the Lord so we see something here Malachi 3 was before the Lord Himself Malachi 4 is before the Lord's bride home I want to introduce Christ want to introduce the bride hallelujah oh but what was Malachi 4 as John was sitting in that day as an icebreaker to make way for Christ then so is brother Branham said and this day to break through the denominational systems to set us free from from the so that the god of history can become the god of the present as Malachi 3 made way for the ship of Christ to bring forth precious cargo amen to deliver the people from their sins so did brother Branham come to break the ice amen to break through so that the ship called the old ship of Zion who's carrying precious cargo even you even you amen so he can make its way into the portals of glory he said otherwise I've come and smite the earth with the Curtis well if you look at the at the amplified version of that you find that he is going to smite the earth with a curse that's inevitable it's already been spoken it's already been pronounced but I send you Elijah the Prophet amen to restore your hearts back to the faith of the Apostolic fathers so that you can put forth another branch home and to bring forth a rapture amen and then the curse will come in the Great Tribulation glory to God he's breaking he's broke through amen oh my he broke through the veils he broke through the barriers oh my he broke the grip hallelujah oh my he's here tonight that same Jesus oh my my mind goes back to a day when there was a couple of disciples and they were the Apostle Paul had got a vision from God to go to Macedonia and so he told his partner there brother Silas he said I've got a mission from the Lord I got to go to Macedonia they said well brother Paul go anywhere you want to go you know after all you know you've got the message all right so they got over there they wasn't there no time they was thrown in jail well Paul so much for your vision you know well you missed it on that one here we are in jail they're probably going to kill us hang in there on old rusty chains cockroaches and rats and every other kind of thing and human wastage all around them and the stench of death and oh my just a horrible place and so now then they got to a certain place it looked like it was all all bit lost and so midnight came around Paul says well let's just praise Him let's just praise him in the night so just when all things go wrong that's the best time to just praise the Lord amen so Paul got the singing down at the cross from a savior died Dowler for sin oh my alleluia after a little while the Silas got to singing it after a little while they they got to swinging on the chains hallelu oh my they got to singing I'm one of the eminent and all these people may not learn it being all that got to be it didn't happen they got singing I'll fly away after a little while there that day it just got wild in there and then what happened hey man the breaker came he started breaking up the jail hey shower breaking up the earth he's heard of the things started falling down around their ears oh if it wasn't good enough was going to die in prison now we're going to die in earthquake Haven just keep singing Silas hey oh you got a singing I'm feeling so much better hey man talking about this good old way and after a little while the chains broke off of them the prisoners was all let go what wasn't hate when they had a jailbreak please God whoa kayla was gonna kill herself and powerless stored they said don't do yourself no harm the breakers here believe on the Lord and you and your whole house will be saying [Applause] whatever has you bound whatever lie the devil's told Amen the breakers here
