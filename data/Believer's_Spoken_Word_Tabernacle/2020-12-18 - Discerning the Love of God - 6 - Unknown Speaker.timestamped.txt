[35:31] shall Thou shalt love thy neighbor and
[35:33] hate thine enemy but I say unto you love
[35:37] your enemies bless them that curse you
[35:40] do good to them that hate you and pray
[35:43] for them which despitefully use you and
[35:46] persecute you that ye may be the
[35:49] children of your father which is in
[35:51] heaven for he maketh his son to rise on
[35:55] the evil and on the good and his and
[35:58] sendeth Reign on the just and on the
[36:01] unjust for if ye love them which love
[36:04] you what reward have ye do not even the
[36:08] publicans the same now I want you to
[36:09] notice what he just said here in verse
[36:12] 45 that ye may be the children of your
[36:15] father which is in heaven for he maketh
[36:17] his son to rise on the evil and on The
[36:21] Good The Rain he sends on the just and
[36:24] on the
[36:26] unjust so he doesn't just this section
[36:30] gets rain and this one doesn't get rain
[36:33] this one gets Sun this one doesn't get
[36:35] sun but even in how that the sun would
[36:39] come upon the earth and the rain here
[36:42] how that God is pulling from that
[36:44] example in nature of how that we ought
[36:48] to express the love of God or how I
[36:51] should say it is to be expressed through
[36:53] our life it's okay if you want to say
[36:56] help me Lord
[36:58] verse 46 for if you love them which love
[37:01] you what reward have ye do not even the
[37:05] publicans the same and if you salute
[37:08] your brethren only what do you more than
[37:10] others do not even the publicans so be
[37:14] you therefore perfect even as your
[37:18] father which is in heaven is
[37:21] perfect may God add his Blessing to the
[37:23] word as you're being
[37:25] seated we certainly know that this
[37:27] Perfection that God would call us to and
[37:30] bring us to it's the Perfection of his
[37:33] own life to where through and by the
[37:36] grace of God we are led to repentance
[37:39] and how the spirit of God would move to
[37:42] bring about a a change in our life to
[37:46] where his life coming to Quicken that
[37:50] seed that life that is within us so it's
[37:53] no longer our righteousness but it's the
[37:56] righteousness of God God that is working
[37:58] through us so it's the Perfection of God
[38:02] this Perfection that the Lord Jesus is
[38:04] speaking of when we read through all
[38:06] these scriptures this absolutely is
[38:09] impossible for a mortal man or a human
[38:13] being to actually do this in a way that
[38:16] would be acceptable unto God outside if
[38:19] it being God within that life that would
[38:22] actually Empower a life to be able to
[38:25] tap in to this reality of where those
[38:29] who would speak evil against you yet
[38:32] you're able to pray for them to where
[38:34] that you're able to salute those who
[38:37] have not been uh real kind or have not
[38:40] been good to you and to salute them is
[38:42] to be able to Greed them those are
[38:44] things that goes completely against our
[38:46] flesh and in the reality of it is even
[38:49] when you've been born again of the
[38:50] spirit of God sometimes more than others
[38:53] but we find that within it even when
[38:54] you've been born of the spirit of God it
[38:56] is not something that is to go about
[38:58] Loosely in our life that we just take
[39:00] for granted that this is just something
[39:03] that as though that there would be no
[39:05] challenges we realize even after being
[39:07] born again you are still veiled within
[39:10] this body this is why brother bradam
[39:12] over and over when he would preach the
[39:14] messages on Divine love divine love and
[39:16] Sovereign Grace just that whole Cannon
[39:18] of messages and I don't know how many
[39:20] times I've listened to those messages
[39:22] and preaching on love and different
[39:24] aspects of it throughout the years and
[39:26] yet so many times as you come into it
[39:29] there's things that that you look at it
[39:31] and it will be just so inspired to your
[39:33] heart and it's just a little nugget that
[39:35] would minister to our lives in such a
[39:37] way brother brand would place it in this
[39:39] manner you know even when he talked
[39:41] about the maniac in Oregon coming on the
[39:43] stage and you know the bull and the
[39:45] pasture and the bees we're many of us
[39:47] are familiar with those stories of of
[39:51] the reality of God taking a hold in
[39:54] those times now remember brother B will
[39:57] tell tell us over and over he said oh if
[39:59] I could just live in that something that
[40:02] came down upon me and he would talk
[40:05] about that oh if I could just dwell
[40:07] there within that and you know there is
[40:10] many of us here that no doubt perhaps to
[40:13] every believer you've experienced things
[40:15] in your life where the love of God has
[40:18] come down and he's taken control maybe
[40:20] it's a situation that you really don't
[40:22] want to deal with maybe it's something
[40:24] that you realize this could be very
[40:26] contentious or hostile or there could be
[40:29] things that would just blow up and
[40:31] you're praying and here you are you're
[40:32] going into it oh God help me Lord help
[40:35] me not to speak my own words because
[40:37] remember brother Rand would say many
[40:39] different places even when it came to
[40:41] that Maniac in Oregon brother Ram says
[40:44] when there were when those challenges
[40:45] were made toward him think of it this
[40:47] man walked up up here under the
[40:49] anointing of an evil spirit and he
[40:52] called him a hypocrite called him said
[40:54] you're nothing but but an actor in many
[40:56] different words and spit right in his
[40:58] face but yet brother Bram said instead
[41:00] of despising that man I said I love that
[41:03] man now to think about this there was an
[41:06] atmosphere and I want you to catch this
[41:08] if brother Bram himself was not in
[41:10] contact with God the way he ought to be
[41:13] there could have been a different
[41:14] outcome in that
[41:16] situation because for you and I these
[41:18] are things that we must keep ourselves
[41:21] in the love of God because you and I do
[41:24] not know the situations even that we're
[41:26] going to encounter brother Brandon when
[41:28] he walked into that meeting he had no
[41:30] idea that that Maniac was going to come
[41:33] when he walked into that Pastor had no
[41:35] idea that that bull or even in his
[41:37] backyard with those bees and you think
[41:40] of it that within knowing that brother
[41:42] Bram even said in those times if I had
[41:44] known H like with the bee if I had known
[41:47] I would have went out there with a spray
[41:48] can and taken care of them ahead of time
[41:51] but you see situations that come our way
[41:54] we do not know what's coming but God
[41:56] knows what's coming
[41:57] and everything that God permits it's not
[42:00] about the other person it's about the
[42:02] molding of our character and our life as
[42:05] a matter of fact that these elements
[42:07] that we read about these attributes of
[42:10] love that they might become more
[42:12] preeminent in our life and the only way
[42:15] that love itself will grow and abound
[42:17] and it becomes more preeminent is by the
[42:20] opposition or the trials or things that
[42:22] come our way that actually bring about
[42:25] and cause growth because you and I
[42:27] cannot do this on our own but it takes
[42:29] us giving ourselves to God let me just
[42:32] encourage you not when the situation has
[42:35] come but brother bam said let us live in
[42:37] an atmosphere he said where it's an
[42:39] atmosphere of compassion an atmosphere
[42:42] of consoling an atmosphere that is ready
[42:45] at that moment in other words a life
[42:47] that is yielded and ready for God to
[42:50] step down and take over in that moment
[42:52] because that's what we need is a God to
[42:55] come on the scene but Sovereign Grace
[42:58] and take over in these times I tell you
[43:00] it's been so precious when I've
[43:02] witnessed that in my own life of
[43:04] situations and things and times and I
[43:06] tell you when it comes like that you
[43:08] just feel like there's just Supreme
[43:10] control at that moment because you
[43:12] realize there's one he's got it all in
[43:14] control and there's no the the nerves
[43:16] are gone fear is gone everything else
[43:19] concerning the situation it's just a
[43:21] wonderful place because you just know
[43:23] that God has it right in control it's
[43:26] just so wonderful F and then what a
[43:28] privilege we have as Believers to enter
[43:30] into this and so indeed the scriptures
[43:33] that we read we know that it is indeed
[43:36] possible and all things are possible
[43:38] with God and to Believers this is also
[43:41] possible 1 Corinthians 134 I want to
[43:44] read and and upon this scripture charity
[43:47] suffereth long and is
[43:50] kind in the Amplified it says it like
[43:53] this love endures long and is patient
[43:57] and kind these are some of the things I
[44:00] want to just move back into here tonight
[44:02] and deal a little bit more if God would
[44:04] help us with this suffering long and
[44:07] then into the part there uh of that of
[44:09] of kind and notice as it's mentioned
[44:12] here it endures long and is patient and
[44:17] is kind now this suffering long when we
[44:20] look at it here in the Scripture it
[44:22] means to be of a long Spirit it means to
[44:26] be patient
[44:28] in bearing the offenses and injuries of
[44:31] others to be mild and slow to punish now
[44:34] these scriptures that I opened up with
[44:36] here tonight in Matthew 5 if you look at
[44:38] those scriptures you would look and say
[44:40] well that's with people that are are
[44:42] without those are people that uh would
[44:45] not even maybe profess to be Believers
[44:48] or would not even symbol a symbol Among
[44:50] Us right here and then we read here in 1
[44:53] Corinthians 13:4 it doesn't make a
[44:56] difference difference here the love of
[44:58] God doesn't make a difference in saying
[45:01] that you're to be this way toward just
[45:03] those of the household of faith but the
[45:05] Bible says be patient toward all men and
[45:09] these are all these are the attributes
[45:11] remember brother BR would saying like
[45:13] this he says when he's picking up the
[45:15] thought of Faith being seen and he would
[45:17] say and seed is not ever the Shu he said
[45:20] faith in your heart is what God sees but
[45:22] he says your actions is what others see
[45:25] that's why he says You must love one
[45:27] another and by this shall all men know
[45:30] that you are my disciples you see when
[45:33] we look at this and seeing that it's
[45:35] slow to punish or to avenge the wrong
[45:39] you know longsuffering itself is one of
[45:41] the fruits of the spirit it's one of the
[45:45] fruits and to think of it fruit itself
[45:47] when we look at this to be longsuffering
[45:50] there there would be there would be no
[45:52] manifestation of longsuffering needed if
[45:55] there wasn't conditions that merited for
[45:58] longsuffering to display itself a person
[46:01] could say oh I'm longsuffering I suffer
[46:03] long I have I I'm just have so much of
[46:06] that but yet unless that is actually
[46:09] what is displayed in the midst of trial
[46:12] or adversity or when offenses come then
[46:16] it's not longsuffering you see these
[46:18] fruits of the spirit many of them are
[46:21] what are born or manifest in the time of
[46:24] adversity it's a time you know how it is
[46:26] when offense come the offenses can sting
[46:29] offenses can hurt and you can't sit here
[46:31] and say Well it don't bother me you're
[46:33] not being honest there are things that
[46:35] bother us if somebody says something
[46:37] about us or we're misunderstood or
[46:39] something is perceived wrong it bothers
[46:42] us what does it bother it bothers this
[46:44] guy right here but there's a part of it
[46:47] there that on the inside that really can
[46:49] if we can reach out to God and say Lord
[46:52] help me Lord in the midst of this time
[46:54] and help my brother help my sister and
[46:57] see when we look at this the slowness
[47:00] into avenge any wrong then we can find
[47:03] that the fruit of the spirit there of
[47:06] longsuffering will come out now you see
[47:09] it it entails uh uh uh that of offenses
[47:12] and you remember the Lord Jesus himself
[47:15] he said offenses will
[47:17] come offenses come from outside offenses
[47:22] come from
[47:23] inside you see the enemy does not care
[47:27] he will take into account any situation
[47:30] and this is where we need discernment of
[47:33] the love of God because situations come
[47:36] in that we can dig our heels in and yet
[47:39] when we dig our heels in we're losing
[47:41] sight of really what the focus is all
[47:43] about because let me just be very honest
[47:46] and very plain with you everybody that
[47:48] even comes here to this assembly or that
[47:50] even would be Associated around the
[47:52] message of the hour is not believers
[47:57] woo sometimes you might say well isn't
[48:00] everybody that know sometimes there are
[48:02] situations that come where you have
[48:04] lives that they will never be Believers
[48:08] you'll have make Believers you have
[48:09] those who do not go on and get sealed
[48:12] and with the Holy Spirit and yet here we
[48:14] are walking among them and yet within
[48:17] this here this will take the baptism of
[48:19] the Holy Ghost a new birth whereby a son
[48:22] and daughter of God is actually able to
[48:24] manifest the love of the father that's
[48:27] been bestowed upon them nothing else can
[48:30] do this outside of a son and daughter of
[48:32] God and it's not the ability or that of
[48:35] the son and daughter of God it is that
[48:38] where God's love pulsating through that
[48:40] life to reflect this so offenses are
[48:43] going to come there's no way to avoid
[48:45] offenses coming I know that may not seem
[48:48] real encouraging but the reality is if
[48:50] you think back to what we were looking
[48:51] at last week you have access when you
[48:54] have been born of the spirit of God
[48:56] you've got access to the Fountain of God
[48:59] you're tapped into a place a resource
[49:01] that gives you the strength to be able
[49:03] to address these
[49:05] things remember the enemy he he don't
[49:08] care he'll do anything he can to take
[49:10] you off track in any way he'll let
[49:12] things come he'll try to bring in try to
[49:14] bring in things and disagreements and
[49:16] whatever more and we find that you know
[49:18] but charity itself as it speaks in this
[49:21] scripture it is slow to write the wrong
[49:26] in other words words it's merciful it
[49:29] doesn't say that what has been done is
[49:32] not wrong it just it expresses that
[49:36] charity is slow to come and write the
[49:39] wrong meaning as it is of a long Spirit
[49:43] now look at this in the scripture in
[49:45] Psalms 145:8 this is a quality of the
[49:48] Lord himself the Lord is gracious and
[49:51] full of compassion slow to anger and of
[49:55] great Mercy
[49:56] now this here David would write of this
[49:59] in a few different places he would refer
[50:02] if I can just refer to them without
[50:04] reading tonight he would refer to even
[50:07] the Journey of how God brought Israel
[50:10] out of Egypt and even when God would
[50:12] Proclaim his name to Moses one of the
[50:16] very first attributes that God would
[50:19] display is he is the god who is
[50:22] longsuffering and of great mercy and it
[50:25] goes on to say you know uh keeping Mercy
[50:28] for thousands and and will by no means
[50:30] clear the guilty now think of this God
[50:33] himself if if it was not longsuffering
[50:36] there would not even be a chance or an
[50:38] opportunity for somebody to get right if
[50:42] the moment that you and I think about it
[50:44] we are born in sin shaped in iniquity
[50:47] come to the world speaking lies if there
[50:49] was no long suffering the very moment
[50:52] whatever that when the age of
[50:54] accountability sometimes it comes in
[50:56] earlier life the especially in the Agee
[50:58] we're living in where they begin to
[51:00] recognize what's right and what's wrong
[51:02] at the very slightest thing when you say
[51:04] something that's not right or a lie is
[51:07] told and something begins to move at
[51:09] that part by that nature of that first
[51:11] birth and it moves at that moment if
[51:14] there was no longsuffering you or I
[51:17] would have no opportunity at all but God
[51:22] is longsuffering as a matter of fact you
[51:24] might have been a skeptic you might have
[51:26] actually been one who said well I don't
[51:28] know anything about this maybe even as a
[51:30] young person or an older person there
[51:33] could have been something that remember
[51:34] even brother brandham had friends that
[51:36] would speak and even the Infidel when he
[51:39] went to visit him there in Indiana he
[51:41] said the problem I've got with you
[51:43] preachers is you're baring up the wrong
[51:45] tree but you see look at the
[51:47] longsuffering of God the longsuffering
[51:49] of God did not strick that man down he
[51:52] was wrong he should have never spoke
[51:54] that way but the longsuffering of God
[51:56] what did it do it created an opportunity
[51:59] for the mercy of God to move down and to
[52:03] rescue that Soul that's what
[52:05] longsuffering is all about it's not
[52:07] about you it's not about me it's about
[52:10] the other person and you realize
[52:12] sometimes suffering long is not even
[52:14] about that person per se it might be
[52:17] somebody else's watching you on the job
[52:20] somebody else is watching you in the
[52:22] assembly and they're watching the way
[52:24] that their life is conducted listen
[52:26] people will not read the Bible but
[52:28] they'll read your life because what it
[52:30] is it takes the spirit of God inside of
[52:33] your life to give the Bible a real
[52:36] reality and bring it from a letter into
[52:39] a manifestation and people will watch
[52:41] and they will look at a living reality
[52:44] so without longsuffering there is no
[52:46] opportunity for
[52:48] forgiveness when God remember when God
[52:51] had told Moses step aside and I'm going
[52:53] to kill him here was the anger of God
[52:56] but notice this mercy longsuffering and
[53:00] compassion was made manifest through a
[53:04] mortal it was manifest because it was so
[53:08] resided in Moses heart notice Moses gave
[53:12] place to God God became the preeminent
[53:15] one in his life Moses was so I hope
[53:18] you're catching this he was so in
[53:20] wrapped in the promise until as he was
[53:24] so wrapped in the promise coming out of
[53:26] the presence of God he did not side with
[53:29] God and say you know what let's kill
[53:30] every one of them that's right me and
[53:32] you've had a good time man look how good
[53:34] we are I mean what a wonderful time
[53:36] these sorry people just wipe them off
[53:39] but no being in the presence of God the
[53:41] right way come on now not just going
[53:44] down on your knees and praying but
[53:46] really breaking into the channel there
[53:48] to really get Before the Throne of God
[53:51] to where you are affected in a way when
[53:54] you come out of there it's the long
[53:56] suffering of God an atmosphere of your
[53:58] life where there's a consoling you
[54:00] cannot go into prayer where you're
[54:02] looking down at somebody and come back
[54:04] out you might say well I've done that
[54:06] that's because you didn't pray all you
[54:07] did was a ritual when you really get
[54:10] into prayer you begin to lose sight of
[54:13] yourself you lose sight of your feelings
[54:17] you lose sight and you begin to get a
[54:19] focus on him and the right focus on
[54:22] other
[54:23] people you see this is why many things
[54:25] exist people people pray but they don't
[54:28] pray they never get anywhere in prayer
[54:32] well help me preach you see the reality
[54:35] is Moses had come out of the presence of
[54:38] almighty God you see what a what a
[54:40] wonderful thing how God when instruct us
[54:42] and guide us within this to show us that
[54:45] there is an outlet there is a place that
[54:48] we can go in God to where God is able to
[54:52] turn everything our thoughts our
[54:54] attitude even in the situation
[54:56] when we've been hurt and we get to we
[54:59] get to praying and go in there to a
[55:01] place to where we come out and it's no
[55:03] longer about
[55:07] us oh god brother Samuel what would the
[55:10] purpose of that be if Moses had not had
[55:13] that there would have been no going
[55:15] forward you see this is where the
[55:18] responsibility Falls for every one of us
[55:20] do you want to see the assembly go
[55:21] forward do you want to see the work of
[55:23] God go forward do you want to see it in
[55:25] your own life do you you want to see it
[55:26] in your family you see you control that
[55:29] you have a part to play in that this is
[55:32] where it's very vital and very important
[55:34] because if we get to looking at one
[55:36] another you say well this one makes
[55:38] mistakes brother Rand would pick it up
[55:40] in 64 questions and answers and say you
[55:42] make mistakes also so it behooves us to
[55:46] be able to look at it and say God help
[55:48] me help my brother help my sister this
[55:50] is not where we come come along and you
[55:53] know become a bunch of sorry people
[55:54] where well nobody can over come anything
[55:57] that's not what we're talking about
[55:58] we're talking about having Grace in our
[56:01] heart and being full of the mercy of
[56:03] almighty God as God could see the cross
[56:06] in Moses and could not step over it I
[56:09] pray oh God let it be the cross you see
[56:12] in me because remember he cannot and he
[56:15] will not walk over the cross he will not
[56:18] walk over his
[56:19] word this is why as brother R said when
[56:22] God is moving he said you put the word
[56:25] before him he said God won't cross over
[56:27] it you see this is a place that we have
[56:29] Lord this is what you've called me to as
[56:32] a Believer Lord this is my desire Lord
[56:35] help me Lead Me Lord God that I can be
[56:38] free of these feelings these thoughts
[56:40] Lord Jesus help me Lord to enter in ask
[56:43] him for help he will guide you he will
[56:46] help you in these things notice this
[56:49] here God would remember in Psalm 78 how
[56:53] that the scripture would say verse 38
[56:55] but he being full of of compassion
[56:57] forgave their iniquity and destroyed
[56:59] them not yay many a time he turned his
[57:01] anger away and did not stir up all his
[57:04] wrath for he remembered that they were
[57:07] but flesh a wind that passeth away and
[57:11] cometh not
[57:13] again you know it's something that when
[57:15] you can we can go back and reflect on
[57:17] the longsuffering of God that has come
[57:20] to
[57:21] us Paul would write in 1 Timothy 1:15
[57:24] this is a faithful saying and Worthy of
[57:26] all exception that Christ Jesus came
[57:28] into the world to save Sinners of whom I
[57:30] am chief how be it for this cause I
[57:33] obtained Mercy that in me first Jesus
[57:36] Christ might show forth all
[57:38] longsuffering for a pattern to them
[57:41] which should after would believe on him
[57:43] to life Everlasting no wonder Paul could
[57:46] write of an experience of the kindness
[57:49] of Jesus Christ being expressed to his
[57:52] life no wonder Paul could write with his
[57:55] Gra love wherewith he loved us look how
[57:59] Paul could write and say in capturing
[58:02] the longsuffering of God realizing this
[58:04] was a man who was persecuting the Church
[58:07] of the Living God he said I blasphemed
[58:10] in ignorance Paul knew what the
[58:12] longsuffering of God was he could bring
[58:15] that to mind so when Paul was writing
[58:17] this by inspiration as the spirit of God
[58:20] would Inspire him and say admonish the
[58:23] Believers admonish the children of God
[58:25] that they would be longsuffering
[58:28] encourage them you know we need
[58:29] encouragement we need to be reminded of
[58:32] these things Lord let me be encouraged
[58:34] in these things Paul himself was one
[58:37] that he could look back and say God I
[58:40] didn't deserve how that you were of a
[58:42] long spirit with me if you would have
[58:45] Avenged me upon me speedily the wrong I
[58:48] was coming I H stood there and I held
[58:51] the coats of those who stoned Steven
[58:54] Lord you could have Avenged me but the
[58:56] longsuffering of God why why was God
[58:59] longsuffering because there was a vessel
[59:01] of Mercy that was
[59:04] there no wonder you know brother Ram
[59:07] would put it like
[59:09] this in spoken words original see let me
[59:11] just referred to it for time brother
[59:14] Bram said somebody came to
[59:16] me and they told me somebody had said
[59:19] something bad about me first of all that
[59:22] was
[59:24] dumb I just I forgive me I don't know
[59:26] how else to say it but the Bible says
[59:29] you're not to be a tail
[59:31] Bearer Oh Brother s you don't know what
[59:33] Brother s so said I don't care what
[59:34] brother so and so said hello you make
[59:38] sure that you're a conduit for life not
[59:41] trash preach brother Samuel you see they
[59:44] came and told brother Brandon this now
[59:46] evidently the person you know even with
[59:48] learning this right here they came to
[59:51] brother Bram and brother brandham
[59:52] mentioned you know in that time brother
[59:54] Bram says oh forgive
[59:56] it and the man looked at brother randam
[59:59] said how in the world can you do that
[1:00:02] they spoke against you and against your
[1:00:05] family brother Ram takes it like this
[1:00:08] and he's dealing with predestination in
[1:00:10] this quote in spoken word he said what
[1:00:12] it is he says if I looked down here all
[1:00:16] the time I would get off
[1:00:20] track but he says what you have to do
[1:00:22] you've got to look to the end and he
[1:00:25] says like this that was predestinated to
[1:00:28] give me a
[1:00:30] trial see it's to recognize in that way
[1:00:35] how could brother Rand was this because
[1:00:36] there was some great genetics in the
[1:00:38] brandom family you know better than that
[1:00:41] because you know about the genetics that
[1:00:43] was there when the teacher gave him a
[1:00:45] string to tie around his finger to help
[1:00:47] him control his temper eventually he
[1:00:49] just threw the string down he needed
[1:00:51] something greater than any mediation of
[1:00:53] man he needed a mediator he need needed
[1:00:56] the Lord Jesus to come down and bring a
[1:00:58] real salvation and a real New Birth in
[1:01:01] his life to give him power and authority
[1:01:04] now to look at this here how that he
[1:01:06] would look at it and I think that we can
[1:01:08] draw from this in this manner that it's
[1:01:10] Satan's desire to get our Focus off of
[1:01:14] the
[1:01:16] end that's his desire because wherever
[1:01:19] you get focused you'll find your
[1:01:21] affections you'll find your emotions
[1:01:23] you'll find your dinner table talk
[1:01:28] James 1 verse 19 wherefore my beloved
[1:01:31] Brethren let every man be swift to hear
[1:01:36] slow to speak I know very
[1:01:39] simple two
[1:01:41] ears one
[1:01:42] mouth some may be bigger than others but
[1:01:45] two ears one mouth Swift to hear
[1:01:49] slow to speak slow to wrath for the
[1:01:54] wrath of man worketh not the
[1:01:57] righteousness of
[1:01:59] God he that is slow Proverbs 14:29 he
[1:02:03] that is slow to wrath is of
[1:02:05] great understanding but he that is of
[1:02:09] hasty Spirit
[1:02:11] exalteth Folly remember this is a
[1:02:15] quality of God to be slow to
[1:02:18] anger Proverbs 15:18 a wrathful man
[1:02:22] stirreth up Strife but he that is SL W
[1:02:26] to anger appeaseth Strife this word
[1:02:30] appeases is the same word that describes
[1:02:33] the rest that came into the promised
[1:02:34] land when the land had
[1:02:38] rest notice in the scripture in Proverbs
[1:02:42] 16:32 I know I'm moving along but he
[1:02:44] that is slow to anger is better than the
[1:02:49] mighty
[1:02:51] wow better than the mighty so whoever
[1:02:54] the mightiest would be Mighty in this
[1:02:56] here in the Hebrew is strong a strong
[1:02:59] one my you know it's always showed to be
[1:03:02] great strength and strong one when we
[1:03:05] can get our point across or to avenge
[1:03:08] our wrong sometimes the avenging of our
[1:03:10] wrong is we just got to get our side out
[1:03:13] hello
[1:03:14] somebody it's the avenging of wrong but
[1:03:17] so so the slow to wrath is this possible
[1:03:20] sure it is now I realize I realize as I
[1:03:23] speak here tonight that depending on the
[1:03:25] back ground and the makeup and I'm
[1:03:27] talking to those who are born again
[1:03:28] there can even be struggles within these
[1:03:30] things of where there can actually be
[1:03:33] somewhat of a battle where different
[1:03:35] ones would fight but greater is he that
[1:03:37] is in you when you know your weakness
[1:03:39] don't let the devil beat you up about it
[1:03:41] just keep it covered by the blood of
[1:03:43] Jesus Christ just stay in that place to
[1:03:46] say Lord I need you you see God allows
[1:03:48] those things about you and I to where we
[1:03:50] don't get too puffed up and too big and
[1:03:53] to where that we get to say I got this I
[1:03:55] can handle this on my own no we don't
[1:03:57] got this he's got
[1:03:59] us so notice he that is slow to anger is
[1:04:02] better than the mighty and he that
[1:04:05] ruleth his Spirit than he that taketh a
[1:04:10] city it's one thing to take a city
[1:04:13] that's a great feat but it's another
[1:04:15] thing to be able to rule
[1:04:18] it the gates that come
[1:04:21] in in our spirit think of how Paul would
[1:04:24] write and say in in Romans
[1:04:26] 6 let not sin therefore
[1:04:30] reign in your
[1:04:32] members rain meaning to exercise a
[1:04:36] kingly
[1:04:37] influence when a wrong has been done
[1:04:40] without without getting a thing out if
[1:04:42] you begin to give it place in your
[1:04:43] spirit and in your mind you find it
[1:04:45] start building and it starts to affect
[1:04:47] everything about your life it can affect
[1:04:51] even how you respond to somebody else
[1:04:53] that has nothing to do
[1:04:56] with the person who wronged
[1:04:58] you oh God help us to rule our
[1:05:01] spirit help us to rule it help us to
[1:05:04] have like Nehemiah where they had they
[1:05:06] assembled there of the gates there in
[1:05:09] the wall where the gates were burnt down
[1:05:11] Nehemiah made sure that those Gates were
[1:05:13] restored may God help us that those
[1:05:15] Gates will stand like Nehemiah where
[1:05:18] Nehemiah could say you're not coming in
[1:05:19] on the Sabbath day and sailing inside of
[1:05:22] Jerusalem and if I catch you standing
[1:05:24] outside the gate I'm going kill you
[1:05:26] don't you come around the city in the
[1:05:28] time of the Sabbath let me tell you
[1:05:30] something the Sabbath is not a day of
[1:05:32] the week for us it is the rest of the
[1:05:34] Holy Ghost and we have authority to say
[1:05:37] I don't want none of that stuff here
[1:05:39] you're not coming into any of my inlets
[1:05:41] you're not I don't even want to see you
[1:05:43] around my
[1:05:46] city so here it's not quick to respond
[1:05:49] this is what it would mean to suffer
[1:05:51] long not quick to respond so we we must
[1:05:54] be built up in the grace of the Lord
[1:05:57] Jesus Christ you ever find how easy it
[1:05:59] is to forgive people or to allow
[1:06:01] offenses to pass if you've been in
[1:06:02] really in prayer with God when you've
[1:06:04] really been in fellowship with God it's
[1:06:07] one of those things that really I mean
[1:06:08] people could say things to you but there
[1:06:10] your heart is so filled with the love of
[1:06:13] God it's just like something it just
[1:06:14] almost like it reverberates right off of
[1:06:17] you it's something about it that you you
[1:06:19] you there's something that's so much
[1:06:20] greater y'all don't think I'm talking
[1:06:22] fantasy do you how many know what I'm
[1:06:25] talking about out where you come into a
[1:06:27] place and here maybe you come out of
[1:06:29] your prayer time or out of you know
[1:06:31] studying or looking at things and you
[1:06:32] come out of there and there's not one
[1:06:34] little thing that can poke within that
[1:06:36] you know where you've been you have not
[1:06:38] been just in your bedroom or your prayer
[1:06:40] closet you have passed from this Earth
[1:06:44] you have went Before the Throne of
[1:06:46] almighty God you have been affected like
[1:06:49] Moses was affected oh God let us make
[1:06:52] more trips there
[1:06:56] this is where we need to live now notice
[1:06:58] here so to how we look at this you know
[1:07:01] to be quick we're you know in a time and
[1:07:03] an age and you know it's been as we read
[1:07:05] in the scriptures here you know quick to
[1:07:08] avenge wrongs and things you know I got
[1:07:11] to say this or I got to say that and we
[1:07:13] find out that even uh with people that
[1:07:16] maybe they got a small mouth here but
[1:07:18] they got a big mouth on Facebook or they
[1:07:20] got a small mouth here and a big mouth
[1:07:22] on
[1:07:23] Twitter and they want they want let
[1:07:25] everybody know their opinion you know
[1:07:28] that's like this that's like me walking
[1:07:30] out in the parking lot and you chasing
[1:07:32] me down to tell me what you think about
[1:07:35] my tires I really don't
[1:07:38] care I don't want to know your
[1:07:42] opinion if I asked for it then I'd ask
[1:07:46] for
[1:07:47] it woo that's
[1:07:51] free see quick responses you find things
[1:07:54] where where where people can be it's
[1:07:56] such you know revengeful and you know
[1:07:59] saying this and man they got to get
[1:08:00] their point across here and get their
[1:08:02] point across there but Samuel I've got
[1:08:04] people like that on my Facebook what
[1:08:06] should I
[1:08:08] do by the love of God defriend
[1:08:13] them because if it's going to Rouse
[1:08:15] chaos and turmoil look these are things
[1:08:18] that we have to know as Sons and
[1:08:20] Daughters of God that I don't want that
[1:08:22] stuff coming into my home I don't want
[1:08:24] it into my mind I I don't want it into
[1:08:26] my life I have got enough challenge with
[1:08:28] this guy right here I do not need
[1:08:31] firewood from anywhere else I don't need
[1:08:34] seeds from anywhere
[1:08:37] else this is why brother Randon when he
[1:08:39] would talk about brother Veil remember
[1:08:41] in Christ the mystery and here they were
[1:08:42] in the blue barar now all of a sudden
[1:08:44] you know something opens up about the
[1:08:46] tax case again and brother Veil you know
[1:08:49] pipes up at that moment and he and he
[1:08:51] says my goodness he says brother R when
[1:08:53] people were talking about him he said
[1:08:55] how in the world can you let people talk
[1:08:57] to you like that and brother BR says
[1:08:59] brother veale he said a very smart and
[1:09:01] intellectual man he said I think he's
[1:09:03] been dealing with these intellectual
[1:09:05] people so long he just knows how to lay
[1:09:07] the word in there till they don't know
[1:09:08] where to stand he said but he's a little
[1:09:10] too quick on the
[1:09:16] trigger I and you know brother Bale he
[1:09:19] said my I said that takes an awful lot
[1:09:20] of Grace to think like that and brother
[1:09:23] Brown would tell him he said but he goes
[1:09:25] in to how remember the crippled man when
[1:09:28] David was walking out of the Kingdom
[1:09:29] being exiled and that crippled man spit
[1:09:32] on David and brother Bram would say it
[1:09:34] in that manner he said notice how David
[1:09:37] said let him alone remember somebody
[1:09:39] said shall I take his head off and David
[1:09:42] said let him alone the Lord told him to
[1:09:45] do that that was a test for David David
[1:09:48] was tested all along that was a test for
[1:09:53] David brother r said the Lord has told
[1:09:57] them to do that oh my I I I just I
[1:10:00] believe this is what I believe I believe
[1:10:02] the caliber and the quality of the Holy
[1:10:04] Ghost that was manifest in a Son of God
[1:10:07] the prophet of God in this age I believe
[1:10:09] that same thing about my Holy
[1:10:11] Ghost I believe that this is one who has
[1:10:14] come to maturity one who showed
[1:10:17] demonstrated manifest before us of what
[1:10:20] a real Son of God
[1:10:22] is oh my you know you want to be like
[1:10:25] the one remember who had asked uh
[1:10:28] remember he had a debt in Matthew 18 he
[1:10:31] had a debt he owed he owed he owed a lot
[1:10:33] of money a lot of tal talents I think it
[1:10:35] was 10,000 and his lord said pay
[1:10:38] up and what did he say have patience
[1:10:41] with me suffer long with me and the Lord
[1:10:45] was moved with
[1:10:48] compassion and He restored to him
[1:10:50] everything that he had sold from him
[1:10:53] family house so forth and he said I will
[1:10:56] repay thee but that same man turned
[1:10:59] around he had a
[1:11:01] servant that owed him a couple talents
[1:11:04] it wasn't like what he owed the Lord he
[1:11:06] owed the Lord 10,000 his his servant his
[1:11:09] servant owed him too or five and he
[1:11:13] grabbed the guy by the neck pay me what
[1:11:15] you owe
[1:11:17] me and they got around back to the Lord
[1:11:21] wait a minute this man asked for
[1:11:23] patience from you I gave you patience
[1:11:27] suffered long with
[1:11:29] you but now you want this the man was
[1:11:33] thrown into the prison right until he
[1:11:37] repented of
[1:11:39] that sometimes torment is a rod of
[1:11:43] Correction are you with me see the mercy
[1:11:46] of God will not allow one of his
[1:11:48] children to get by with
[1:11:51] misbehavior he won't allow that to
[1:11:53] happen brother Bram takes us into that
[1:11:54] real deep in the in the Hebrew Series in
[1:11:56] many places over and over how God will
[1:11:58] not lose one even if one of his will not
[1:12:01] come to correction brother Ben told us
[1:12:03] he said God will take him on home if he
[1:12:05] won't be
[1:12:07] corrected notice let me get this last
[1:12:09] part here 1 Corinthians 13:4 it
[1:12:12] suffereth long and is kind
[1:12:17] my so to suffer long this charity
[1:12:20] suffereth long we're talking about an
[1:12:22] inward work we're talking about an in
[1:12:25] power that manifests itself not slow to
[1:12:30] wrong but is also
[1:12:34] kind that's a simple word is't it it's
[1:12:37] like one of those words that you're
[1:12:39] taught when you're real little it's a
[1:12:42] word that we taught in Sunday school
[1:12:46] it's a word that we taught
[1:12:49] preschool and God is still teaching
[1:12:53] us amen notice in Proverbs 31 notice
[1:12:58] what it speaks concerning this type of
[1:13:00] the Bride she is strength and honor are
[1:13:04] her cloth and she shall rejoice in time
[1:13:07] to come she openeth her mouth with
[1:13:10] wisdom and in her tongue is the law of
[1:13:17] kindness no man can Bridle the
[1:13:22] tongue but God can
[1:13:26] God
[1:13:27] can and I can tell you if you've got a
[1:13:29] if you've got a bad where it just seems
[1:13:32] like you're you're ready to spout and
[1:13:33] ready to say but Sam what's the remedy
[1:13:35] well if you're not born again get born
[1:13:37] again but but if but if you are that's
[1:13:40] been settled in your heart then just
[1:13:42] remember keep it covered with the blood
[1:13:44] of Jesus stay in his presence and say
[1:13:46] Lord strengthen me Lord help me Lord
[1:13:49] Jesus you see it's speaking the truth
[1:13:52] and love we would find that through the
[1:13:54] scripture because because you know it's
[1:13:56] out of the heart that the mouth would
[1:13:58] speak this is what Jesus said bless them
[1:14:01] that curse you pray for them that
[1:14:05] despitefully use
[1:14:07] you I think that's
[1:14:10] a nobody likes feeling
[1:14:13] used nobody does nobody like even
[1:14:16] somebody who is the most generous person
[1:14:18] in the world you can
[1:14:21] tell pray for them who would
[1:14:23] despitefully use
[1:14:26] you think of this in first 1 Peter
[1:14:29] chapter 3: 8 finally be ye all of One
[1:14:33] mind having compassion one of another
[1:14:36] that means it's reciprocated back and
[1:14:38] forth love as Brethren be pitiful be
[1:14:43] courteous this means be kind not
[1:14:46] rendering evil for evil or railing for
[1:14:50] railing Oh my he would have to write
[1:14:52] this to Believers yes because also
[1:14:56] remember not all there are
[1:14:59] believers and sometimes even a believer
[1:15:02] can get into the wrong
[1:15:04] influence not rendering evil for evil or
[1:15:07] railing for railing but
[1:15:10] Contra blessing so instead of evil for
[1:15:13] evil do the opposite bless knowing that
[1:15:18] ye are there unto called that you should
[1:15:20] inherit a blessing for he that will love
[1:15:23] life and see good days anybody love
[1:15:27] life oh brother Samuel I hate life you
[1:15:30] need
[1:15:31] prayer you need prayer oh brother Samuel
[1:15:34] I just want the Rapture to come I hate
[1:15:36] this life you need prayer because you're
[1:15:38] to enjoy this life I'm not talking about
[1:15:41] the things of the world but I'm talking
[1:15:44] about this life your husband your wife
[1:15:46] your children your grandchildren you're
[1:15:49] not to wish away this life that is not
[1:15:52] what the coming of the Lord is all about
[1:15:55] it's to live and to enjoy Paul would
[1:15:58] write to enjoy in the book of Timothy to
[1:16:00] enjoy those things that God has given to
[1:16:03] us to enjoy life to have joy we ought to
[1:16:06] have joy in this life not just well Lord
[1:16:09] I have joy when you transform my body
[1:16:11] you're missing something you're to have
[1:16:13] joy right
[1:16:16] now this Joy leads into that Joy it's
[1:16:20] this joy that makes us look with a real
[1:16:23] expectation and and a real Earnest in
[1:16:26] our life it's that joy that gets a hold
[1:16:28] of somebody's attention and says my
[1:16:31] goodness what is it that's about your
[1:16:36] life doesn't mean that you're skipping
[1:16:38] down the street the joy of the Lord is
[1:16:40] our strength meaning that you know where
[1:16:42] you
[1:16:43] stand you know what he has done in your
[1:16:46] life and this is real Joy you might be
[1:16:48] in the midst of chaos you might be in
[1:16:50] the midst of the hardest trial but yet
[1:16:52] you've got joy you can conduct yourself
[1:16:55] with joy why because as a Son of God and
[1:16:59] a daughter of God you know who you are
[1:17:02] it isn't that you know the outcome of
[1:17:03] the trial it isn't that you know how
[1:17:05] things are going to come out that's not
[1:17:07] faith faith is my life is in his hands I
[1:17:11] trust him
[1:17:13] completely for he that will love life
[1:17:16] and see good
[1:17:18] days oh my let
[1:17:22] him refrain his Young from
[1:17:28] Evil and his lips that they speak no
[1:17:35] gu anybody love
[1:17:37] life you want to see good
[1:17:41] days and don't speak
[1:17:45] evil let our lives be so full of
[1:17:50] God to what we're speaking about is him
[1:17:56] and no matter the conversations of the
[1:17:58] day it always comes back to
[1:18:01] him to him what he's showing us what
[1:18:04] he's speaking to us what he's doing let
[1:18:08] him notice this es skew evil that means
[1:18:11] to go out of the way go out of the way
[1:18:13] of evil to turn oneself away from it let
[1:18:15] him escue evil and do good and let him
[1:18:18] seek peace and ensue it brother would
[1:18:21] say it just like
[1:18:23] this he would speak in this is your life
[1:18:26] worthy of the Gospel talking about us
[1:18:29] being in love to in love with your
[1:18:33] enemy somebody would call you Holy
[1:18:36] Roller and he said be careful be
[1:18:38] careful but when you really find
[1:18:40] yourself in love with them regardless of
[1:18:42] what they do you still love
[1:18:44] them then you begin to find and your
[1:18:48] patience gets from about that long till
[1:18:51] they just don't have no
[1:18:53] end how many say Lord give me more
[1:18:56] patience right
[1:19:00] now give me more patience then what what
[1:19:04] is it that brings Patience Test trials
[1:19:10] offenses this is letting patience have
[1:19:12] her perfect work so notice patience will
[1:19:15] grow it starts out as brother Bram would
[1:19:18] illustrate it maybe I can just jump in
[1:19:19] it starts out about this long but thank
[1:19:22] God it's that long and then it'll grow
[1:19:24] to this long long then to this long and
[1:19:27] then to this long what is it it's
[1:19:30] growing it's a fruit of the spirit that
[1:19:33] is growing in your life notice it'll
[1:19:36] just to ain't no end and anybody just
[1:19:38] keeps saying things about you well I
[1:19:40] don't care what they say don't get
[1:19:42] stirred up look at this if you get
[1:19:44] stirred up you better go
[1:19:48] pray
[1:19:51] first well how would I know if I'm going
[1:19:53] to get stirred up check your spirit and
[1:19:55] how you think about approaching them
[1:19:57] right now when the way you feel right
[1:20:00] now if you feel all anxious and all
[1:20:02] tensed up right now go pray first go
[1:20:05] pray first because all it's going to
[1:20:07] take is somebody to let a spark off and
[1:20:11] it's this is wisdom here slow to wrath
[1:20:15] what should I do if I'm feeling that go
[1:20:17] pray
[1:20:19] first for you talk to them again don't
[1:20:22] get into fusses
[1:20:26] let me just move on here there's a lot
[1:20:28] but let me just move on this is where
[1:20:32] even the Lord Jesus when he would speak
[1:20:35] in Luke chapter 6 once again just like
[1:20:38] what in Matthew love your enemies do
[1:20:41] good and lend hoping for nothing again
[1:20:43] and your reward shall be great and you
[1:20:46] shall be the children of the highest for
[1:20:47] he is
[1:20:49] kind unto the unthankful and to the evil
[1:20:55] now you might as well be honest when
[1:20:58] you've done what you've done and
[1:21:00] somebody says I don't like this this is
[1:21:03] what we're having this is all we've got
[1:21:05] this is what it
[1:21:08] is be kind to the
[1:21:11] unthankful we're living in an age right
[1:21:14] now Paul talked about these Peerless
[1:21:15] times where men would be unth
[1:21:21] thanful unthankful where it's just like
[1:21:24] everything thing is given to us well
[1:21:26] this is just how it ought to
[1:21:28] be it's unthankful it's a spirit that
[1:21:31] has moved even upon the
[1:21:34] world brother Bram even warns to the
[1:21:37] Believers of how the coldness of the
[1:21:40] spirit he said this Spirit many have not
[1:21:42] recognized it in these last days is that
[1:21:46] coldness of the love of God coldness
[1:21:49] moving
[1:21:51] in be he is kind unto those unthankful
[1:21:55] and to the evil my my my be ye therefore
[1:21:59] merciful as your father also is merciful
[1:22:02] brother would say it like this even
[1:22:04] though you may be an unbeliever or
[1:22:06] skeptic that don't keep me from loving
[1:22:08] you I do it anyhow CA it's not me that
[1:22:13] does the loving now let me just inject
[1:22:15] something
[1:22:16] here this love that he's getting read
[1:22:18] that he's talking about is not something
[1:22:21] that walks around and just puts its
[1:22:22] hands and says I love you
[1:22:25] if it's not down here you're a
[1:22:28] hypocrite
[1:22:30] hello do you going to have people that
[1:22:32] want to draw you out well if you really
[1:22:34] have the love of God this is what you'll
[1:22:35] do because many people only know a
[1:22:38] sensual fleshly emotional intellectual
[1:22:43] level they don't know the real love of
[1:22:45] God but notice I do it anyhow cuz it's
[1:22:49] not me that does the loving it's the
[1:22:52] Lord Jesus in my heart that makes me
[1:22:55] love you and me as a man I wouldn't do
[1:22:59] it I'd want to know why when and
[1:23:04] how why should I love him when and how
[1:23:09] as a man but he in me makes me something
[1:23:13] that
[1:23:14] overrides and moves Us in those
[1:23:17] times you know how it is when people
[1:23:19] would
[1:23:20] say you're going to let the boss talk to
[1:23:22] you that way you're going to let so and
[1:23:25] so I mean you know how it is it it goes
[1:23:27] from the middle school classroom or
[1:23:29] cafeteria it travels into the locker
[1:23:31] room then you find it in the workplace
[1:23:34] instigators hello somebody
[1:23:37] instigators what is that demonic
[1:23:41] anointing trying to instigate stir
[1:23:45] something
[1:23:46] up notice he says but Christ in my heart
[1:23:50] says this is me I died for that person
[1:23:54] no matter what you do I still love you
[1:23:56] anyhow not from my lips from my heart
[1:24:01] and every Christian does the same thing
[1:24:03] as long as Jesus abides in the
[1:24:07] heart now let me just let me just try to
[1:24:10] just wrap this part up
[1:24:12] here there really no way to do it but
[1:24:14] let me find this point right here to try
[1:24:16] to close
[1:24:18] on brother
[1:24:20] brandham had been in a meeting
[1:24:24] and uh spirit of God was moving
[1:24:27] discernment was taking
[1:24:30] place how that the Lord would come in
[1:24:33] the service as you know and
[1:24:36] do what needed to what he would come and
[1:24:39] perform his word there was a man who was
[1:24:42] there who was the a Lutheran who was the
[1:24:45] dean of a college and being the dean of
[1:24:48] a college what he said at that time what
[1:24:50] did he say he he wrote a letter to
[1:24:53] brother Bram and said I drove all this
[1:24:57] way to come and hear a
[1:25:03] soothsayer and he began to criticize
[1:25:06] brother brandham horrible in the
[1:25:11] letter I want you to think of this the
[1:25:14] impact of suffering long let me just
[1:25:17] paraphrase some of these points I didn't
[1:25:19] include it to be displayed I just want
[1:25:22] to read over it
[1:25:24] and he called him a polished up
[1:25:28] soothsayer and he be to refer I've been
[1:25:31] preaching before you were ever
[1:25:34] nursing so brother Braham said I I wrote
[1:25:37] him a letter
[1:25:39] back he said he called me brandom he
[1:25:42] wouldn't even call me brother in that
[1:25:44] letter but brother Bram said I still had
[1:25:47] respect for
[1:25:49] him I said dear precious brother no one
[1:25:53] could preach the gospel 50 years and yet
[1:25:56] disrespect Christ I wouldn't think
[1:25:59] so you see he's a man brother talking
[1:26:02] about that man he's a man he's not made
[1:26:05] out of sawdust he's a human
[1:26:10] being and I wrote him a nice letter
[1:26:14] back he had told me the very idea of you
[1:26:17] standing up there I drove 15 miles
[1:26:19] through a blinding snowstorm to hear a
[1:26:22] man of God and what that I find but a
[1:26:24] polished up
[1:26:27] soothsayer now let me just pause right
[1:26:29] there right there we could say as
[1:26:33] brother Brown would go on to
[1:26:34] quote Jesus said if you speak one word
[1:26:37] against the son of man it'll be forgiven
[1:26:40] but to speak one word against the Holy
[1:26:41] Ghost it'll never be forgiven you in
[1:26:44] this life or in the life to come now
[1:26:48] wonder brother bam writing this and he
[1:26:50] refers to that scripture but
[1:26:52] notice the long
[1:26:55] suffering that is mixed within
[1:26:59] it I forgive you for that brother he
[1:27:02] writes about what people has they seen
[1:27:05] Jesus Christ doing the same thing as he
[1:27:07] did in his
[1:27:09] day and I said you know what good has
[1:27:13] your 50 years done but he said in the
[1:27:16] letter but I know you didn't mean that
[1:27:19] from your heart this what brother Bram
[1:27:21] said to the man I know you didn't mean
[1:27:23] that from your heart I just don't think
[1:27:25] that a man could talk about Jesus for 50
[1:27:27] years and preach for him and being a
[1:27:29] dean of a college could talk about Jesus
[1:27:31] like that you're just excited and don't
[1:27:35] understand it what's brother Bram doing
[1:27:38] love is making
[1:27:41] excuses I hope you understand me
[1:27:44] sometimes you know how it is a parent
[1:27:46] can make excuses for their for their
[1:27:48] kids this is not what we're talking
[1:27:50] about here wrong has been done sometimes
[1:27:53] parents can make excuses for their kids
[1:27:55] and you got to keep making them the rest
[1:27:56] of their life are you with me they keep
[1:28:00] coming back to you Lord mommy daddy make
[1:28:02] an excuse for me it's so and so's fault
[1:28:04] and it's this and it's oh you're right
[1:28:06] honey it's their fault they should have
[1:28:07] never you know you're just an Angel
[1:28:11] that's that's the kind of excuses we're
[1:28:12] talking about those are lies those
[1:28:13] aren't excuses you're lying to them
[1:28:15] they'll have problems in their marriage
[1:28:17] if they get married they'll have
[1:28:18] problems all through their life you know
[1:28:20] why you've painted him up to be an angel
[1:28:22] and you've made him a devil
[1:28:25] maybe we should stop long ago here
[1:28:28] notice you're just excited and just
[1:28:31] don't understand it see he's given it
[1:28:33] the benefit of the doubt this is what
[1:28:36] love
[1:28:38] does later he wrote me a letter and he
[1:28:42] said I apologize for that I hear you're
[1:28:45] coming to
[1:28:46] Minneapolis now he invited brother
[1:28:48] brandham to come to the college he said
[1:28:50] brother Bram we want to have dinner with
[1:28:52] you and I want you to come he kept
[1:28:55] saying brother Aon brother Ram kept
[1:28:57] repeating in this message he even stood
[1:28:59] up at that banquet he had dinner and he
[1:29:01] talked about he made known what he had
[1:29:03] said and he said I'm so sorry that I
[1:29:06] said that and he spoke to brother Bram
[1:29:09] he said brother Bram he
[1:29:11] said help us to see it he said we want
[1:29:14] to see a move of God
[1:29:16] here help us we want to see the Holy
[1:29:20] Ghost teach us brother BR you see his
[1:29:23] teaching
[1:29:25] is the reason he was saying what he was
[1:29:29] saying brother randam stood there in
[1:29:31] that time and just begin to talk to him
[1:29:32] you know brother Ram will tell this
[1:29:33] story in many different other places
[1:29:35] they were a college where they had to
[1:29:37] grow their own food their crops and
[1:29:38] brother Bram takes them in the process
[1:29:40] of that stock of corn growing up into
[1:29:43] that place of
[1:29:44] maturity brother R deals with it have
[1:29:47] then how the Holy Ghost would come Faith
[1:29:49] he said faith is a wonderful thing you
[1:29:51] need Faith you must have faith he that
[1:29:53] cometh to God must must first believe
[1:29:54] that he is and he's a rewarder of them
[1:29:56] that diligently seek him it must be by
[1:29:58] faith you are justified by faith but God
[1:30:02] must come and honor that
[1:30:05] faith and right there at that banquet
[1:30:07] table you've heard brother bam tell it
[1:30:10] 400 students and the dean said we want
[1:30:14] to receive it brother random right now
[1:30:16] what do we do he said get out of your
[1:30:18] chairs turn around get on your knees he
[1:30:21] said and put your back to the table and
[1:30:22] start to pray brother br we walked
[1:30:24] around that room and we laid hands on
[1:30:26] over 400 he said every one of them got
[1:30:29] the baptism of the Holy Ghost now this
[1:30:32] is what I want to ask you what if
[1:30:34] brother brandom would not have suffered
[1:30:38] long those students would have never got
[1:30:41] what they needed that man would have
[1:30:43] never got what he needed but suffering
[1:30:46] long slow to avenge the
[1:30:50] wrong what did it do it gave an
[1:30:52] opportunity that that man beneath as
[1:30:55] brother bam says you were just excited
[1:30:57] you didn't understand I pray God help me
[1:31:03] help us I would rather be able I would
[1:31:06] rather you know this is scripture on
[1:31:08] down in through this 1 Corinthians 13 on
[1:31:10] Love It is there for us to be able to
[1:31:12] make excuse I don't understand why
[1:31:15] brother did there are places in the
[1:31:17] scripture where correction indeed has to
[1:31:19] come in the church there are things that
[1:31:21] has to be repented of but there's got to
[1:31:23] to be the heart that is there that's
[1:31:26] willing to receive that life or that
[1:31:28] heart or when the person would come to
[1:31:31] make the wrong
[1:31:34] right it has to be there so all of this
[1:31:38] as brother brandham I think of it if he
[1:31:40] if he had stood in that manner my what
[1:31:43] would have happened we' have never read
[1:31:45] about
[1:31:46] this that man might have been cut
[1:31:49] off see this is why brother Brian would
[1:31:53] tell us
[1:31:54] your
[1:31:55] attitude toward that person could affect
[1:31:59] their Eternal
[1:32:02] destination so God help
[1:32:06] me Brother Sam you need the Lord to help
[1:32:08] you every day every day every day of my
[1:32:13] life every day I need his help I told
[1:32:16] you last week I told you before when I
[1:32:19] how many times have ministered on things
[1:32:21] and in with these parts right here but
[1:32:23] I'll tell you it's not a time that I
[1:32:24] don't read over it and I don't go
[1:32:26] through it even in studying that I find
[1:32:28] myself saying Lord help me help me Lord
[1:32:32] Jesus oh it isn't that we're constantly
[1:32:35] failing it isn't that but it's seeing
[1:32:38] our need of more of him I want more of
[1:32:43] him I want to live more in that presence
[1:32:46] this is my access this is the control is
[1:32:49] when he's got more control of me more
[1:32:52] control of a situation let him have more
[1:32:54] control over you let's pray Heavenly
[1:32:58] Father dear God we love you tonight Lord
[1:33:03] we just appreciate you thank you for
[1:33:06] your mercy thank you Lord for speaking
[1:33:08] to our
[1:33:09] hearts such a simple way that Lord I
[1:33:13] pray that you would help us tonight Lord
[1:33:16] as you've spoke to us you have not
[1:33:18] you've not left us on our own but you
[1:33:21] have allowed us to see that God this
[1:33:24] indeed it is possible I know that Lord
[1:33:28] not only for myself but speaking across
[1:33:30] to my brothers and sisters here we've
[1:33:32] witnessed this Lord we witnessed the
[1:33:35] love of God the
[1:33:37] charity that of God in our life moving
[1:33:41] in these times Lord I pray that you
[1:33:44] would just continue to teach us
[1:33:47] Lord help us father Lord we even in
[1:33:51] times that we live in now sometimes Lord
[1:33:54] when situations and things arise and
[1:33:56] they come Lord there there's nothing
[1:33:59] that Lord that you would let us know
[1:34:01] well this is coming or or this offense
[1:34:03] is going to come or this is going to
[1:34:05] come because even if you did even if you
[1:34:09] did we need
[1:34:11] you help us Lord Jesus help us Lord that
[1:34:15] we might be so hidden in you help us
[1:34:19] dear God to keep these areas of our life
[1:34:21] covered with the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:34:24] Christ help us Lord I
[1:34:27] pray dear God to bear this fruit
[1:34:32] Lord Lord Jesus it'll take more than
[1:34:35] just reading the
[1:34:36] word it'll take more than just listening
[1:34:39] to
[1:34:39] tapes it'll take more than just setting
[1:34:42] under good
[1:34:44] preaching it takes time alone with
[1:34:48] you as your Prophet would tell us he
[1:34:51] said you can do a lot of things too much
