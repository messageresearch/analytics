brother George Smith here with us and just just to really appreciate that the Lord has made a way for our brother to be able to be here with us first time that brother George might be with us but many of you you know you've seen him and with in different videos and different things that he's done and some of you maybe have even seen some of them read some of the different works and different things that's been put together that's been centered around the message and you see a real burden that brother George has always had and that was just to see that the message would would go forth and we're just thankful for that and we just we just want brother George to be able to come and we're just so thankful for him and it's late wife sister Rebekah what a what a great blessing that that they they have been and they are to our lives and we're just so thankful for that tonight I just couldn't help it brother Randy when I was hearing that song the message of his come and you know there's one person I was thinking of there's one person who can sing that song and nobody else can sing that song you know I'm thinking about brother Ferguson but he's but he's on the other side tonight he's

amen brother George why don't you come on brother hey man we want brother George's to take his liberty tonight amen and to see people that come out on cold weather it's almost as cold where I come from but we're just thankful to be here we had to reschedule once we're not gonna let the devil get us down again but if you have your Bibles let's open our stand and open our scriptures to Acts chapter one and appreciate the music you got some real good musicians here family straightened out here in a minute Acts chapter one and verse six this is after the resurrection it says when their their former come together so they didn't stay home did they they got together get that straight they came together and they asked of him saying Lord well at this time well you know at this time restore again the Kingdom of Israel now here's people that's been walking with him and this is the biggest question they could come up with it's just like us they had wives and mother-in-law all in and stuff and they they had this political question unbelievable and he said it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father had put in his own power but you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me both here in Jerusalem over there in Judea over in Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth all the way to Ohio it didn't come in a parachute somebody had to come over here and bring the gospel amen and it's still going on tonight let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you for your grace to us tonight we thank you that we can be surrounded by people that our blood washed people that enjoy the presence of the Lord the good music and Lord we just pray that you would come amongst us now make yourself real to your people Lord as we go down the memory lane one more time to relate the history the things that have come our way we pray that it be a blessing to someone the Lord that we could have fellowship around your word and the Lord that we could go from here and say it was good to be in the house of Lord be with each one you're the one that can bless you're the one that can reward the sacrifice help us in Jesus name Amen you may be seated so I'm not an entertainer although it's okay to laugh in church okay we're not legalists we're not you know those other kind of people but I'm just trying to be a faithful witness of a mighty message that we have and from this scripture that we read it does the same thing about an attorney Jesus Christ is our attorney and he's the only righteous one and it doesn't say anything about a judge we're not to be you know we're not judging things we are fruit inspectors we see things that aren't right we just you know try to help it we don't have all the answers the pastor didn't have all the answers and so we a a lot of times you know when we're at especially in the summertime when the windows are open we're at the house and we hear the neighbor talking on the phone and so we only hear half the conversation right but we are the wise and prudent people of the 21st century so we we make up the rest of it and then we pass judgment and then we get ourselves in a lot of trouble so we're not attorneys we're not judges we're only witnesses and to be a witness you had to be there now what somebody told you about but you have to have the experience yourself so we trust that you can learn something from what we're gonna speak here tonight just gonna kind of get together get acquainted you know that you can fill in the blanks and take away the cobwebs of some of the things you've heard or what you don't understand about the testimony but I'm the eagle that was born in the Baptist chicken yard I wasn't born in the Eagle Nest like some of you I wasn't born in the Catholic nest how many was Baptist be honest a few honest people but we trust that you'll learn something that we can you know be the overcomers that the word says we are now we're not going to be here all night we'll be out before before 10:30 promise because we're gonna come back tomorrow night right Lord will oh yeah so don't try to say it all tonight but my parents were both Americans got to set that straight especially for the Latinos here and the people in South Carolina that said well it's okay mixed marriage because man brother branham gave his daughter to Mexican no that's not the way it worked my father was from Kansas City Missouri and my mother was from Tucson Arizona but my grandfather came from England you know just like me okay so they met in Bible School over in California way back they were married in June of 1944 and immediately went to Mexico because there still is today tribes of people around the world they don't have any idea of Jesus Christ here we come to church you know three times a week we hear it on the radio TV every place but there's places that don't know the gospel yet and there's places that don't even have a written language so back then there was more they've made a lot of progress but they they joined up with the Wickliffe Bible Translators and went into Mexico to find this tribe up in the mountains of Chihuahua which is about 300 miles south of El Paso and they went up in there not knowing one word of Spanish much less that other language and they went as far as the truck would go then they got on these horses that they had hired and went for days up into the mountains now today there's roads go through there but this is almost hundred years ago and so they were up there trying to locate these people and first you have to establish a dictionary they have nothing written it's only verbal you know and so they would have to you know point to something how do you say this and try to sound it out and make up well that takes a long time I'm an eyewitness that my father wasn't that patient and take my word for but he was up there for probably three years and so as happens in new homes the baby's going to be born well they came back on the horses came back out of the mountains instead of going up into the United States they went to the headquarters of that outfit down in Mexico City and that's where their first child was born in late August 1945 that was me so we got that straight eventually I was the first of ten children yeah and so there was five boys and five girls God knows what he's doing you can hear on tape or the brim says God provides for what he sends well by 1952 my father had moved to the east coast of Mexico over by the Gulf of Mexico and that's where I started the elementary school because that's where we lived and so here I was in the school with Mexicans and and I was the only guy that spoke English course I spoke Spanish by then to some you know raised right with him and this was all God's plan of getting a foundation in two languages and my mother not knowing why but she she had a rule at the house and that was in the house you speak English and out there he speaks Spanish now we did not know the word discrimination yet okay so relax it was simply to keep the languages separate all you people Frederico Lord help you but you have to keep the languages separate now I didn't know why back then but then later we'll get to the story why it was important so here I was the missionary son you know with my brother and sisters at the time and and every service every three times a week at least we're in churches right on the front bench and eventually when I was about nine years old I realized that the gospel it wasn't just for all these people was for me too you know because the scripture says that all have sinned all the Smiths children all the brownie children all the brand until drew they've all sinned and in short of the glory God's glory God's over there we can't get there without Jesus Christ so that was my first revelation and so I received the Lord Jesus the Savior and I was baptized in the Baptist Church on Easter Sunday of 1955 now you already know how old I am amazing I still remember all this right now but the Lord's been good to us well we were like say it was in elementary school all Spanish my mother was teaching us at home a little bit of home school but when I got out of the sixth grade my parents made an executive decision without consulting me and they sent me to Texas to live with the family of Baptists and seventh grade on you know well that was interesting so we lived in several places and finally in January of 62 I ended up with my grandfather in Tucson Arizona and so we were in school there and I was like halfway through the 10th grade I think but no when I went there and so this was a big school there's like 2,500 kids and and this is way back you know 60 to 63 when the girls were skirts no shorts at school there was respect it's a different world today you all know that now back then it wasn't though there wasn't the choice issue so we have home school though there's no whole school there wasn't part of the plan there was Christian school the Baptist Church had a Christian school eventually but the the thing was that my dad had this idea first of all he he said we have a democracy here I have the vote no simple now somehow he raised ten children with no rock-and-roll no premarital sex no drugs so he had something going you know and so uh we he had this idea of the the Christian school which so those were his friends that operated the Christian school but he said you know what I see is that when when kids go to the public school they're gonna hear things they shouldn't hear they're gonna get their lunch stolen their things are gonna happen and you you kind of you know gear yourself for it but you go to the Christian school some of the same things happen but you don't expect it there so the solution is family prayer and then no matter where the kids go they're gonna be okay and no television okay so being in high school I had a lot of friends and at the time I was the what do you call it the assistant choir director at the at the Baptist Church and I was in school it's amazing news Akande so forth so all of a sudden in January of 63 I started I saw this other girl at school you know somebody who was different and so I had a lot of friends and so this one girl that I knew she said now you're you're so picky you know you we noticed you don't hardly date anybody and when you do it's only one date and so but we know just the girl for you and so I said well where is she well she so they're getting on the bus and so the next day I'm at Rebecca Branham and sure enough most beautiful lady on the planet you know and so you know how it is you know how was you stop shopping right that's the one and so um and so I found out that her her own she had an older brother Paul this could be a problem but then when I met him he was a skinny kid like me it didn't matter and so she just when I met her then she said well we have to meet my dad okay well being the missionary's kid I had met a lot of preachers so I mean another preacher wasn't a big deal well the miracle is that God had moved these people from Indiana to Arizona 1800 miles away and put him a block and a half from my house so that's more evidence of predestination I didn't have to go hunting it was right there so so I go up in meet Reverend Brenham and he was very nice he was in the backyard didn't have a shirt on he was working with the plants or something and and she disappeared she left us alone Wow and so um we we talked a little while and I don't know what he said I didn't record that didn't think he knows no pictures but when we finished talking I was there for a purpose and I wanted to date his daughter and here I was about 17 years old and so in the process of this few minutes talking he said well sure you know I had permission well at that point I had the victory but he had the problem because there were some other guys that were kind of waiting their opportunity and believe it or not one of them was our friend Mike Seaver he looked a lot different than 63 but anyway yeah I didn't find that out there bout five years ago and so and so what I what I found out a long time later in that short conversation he was deserted me what just discerning what he was looking at right he was er not passed the whole future and that's why he could confidently say yeah you can go out with her so since you guys aren't prophets then don't be trying that you will fail okay so let's move along here and so also I didn't have a fancy car I just had it I had a five year old Ford pickup they didn't have dual cab back then I didn't have electric windows didn't have a lot of things I don't think you had turn signals you know and and I thought and her brother had this brand-new red Chevy oh I look pretty bad but her dad had a Ford station wagon so even down and the fact is that when they first moved Arizona they lived in an apartment farther away but when I met them they lived like a block and a half from my house but when they moved from Arizona from Indiana to Arizona they had already lived in the same house since 1948 till 1962 and during that time of course life was you know has a certain rhythm and the church and the family and friends and so forth and the piano teacher was across the street so every time when everybody went in Rebecca would come home from school she would practice her piano it was just a short you know kind of like the organ is just a spinet piano it wasn't big piano so when they moved Arizona they moved by vision they didn't take a vote we think I would go no they he said we're going so they left they didn't know how long they're gonna be gone it's all they took was their clothes so they get to Arizona and there's no church there's no friends there's no trees there's no piano well it didn't take her very long to find out that the girl at the corner had a grand piano and her mother was a piano teacher so she would gravitate down there when she could and and so then that's the girl that actually introduced us anyway so one day brother branham is taking his family to supper and he's you know they got three children so he looks in the back seat his station wagon there's only two where's Rebecca well she's at the corner figure up down there so he stops at the corner to pick up Rebecca to go to supper and this is before I met him and so he he goes up to the door and he hears this music well yeah there was two girls on one piano and play it and so Rebecca comes down on the bass and the other girl was up at the top of the piano and so he knocks on the door real loud now this wasn't down at the cross and there wasn't any of those songs we just sang it was a movie theme you know and so he knocks on the door and so eventually she comes to the door and now he didn't sure his belt off why when they get you no he was a balanced individual he knew how to treat people okay so all he said was it's time to go so we go she didn't hear another word about her for two months now when you hear about it on tape and think 64 he tells about some of this stuff he tells about how all the music and you think she's you know rock and roll band someplace no they're just do girls not piano but he tell us about the piano and how that all you know the world and he says but then she met George and he's a Christian huh so I was part of the picture didn't even know it you know and so what happened so during that time to transition from you know the piano to go into church with me because there was no church I was taking her to the Baptist Church yeah and so he was happy that she was in church sometimes he went with us yeah William Brandon went to Baptist Church because there wasn't any other Church there and he could say meant a part of the word so when you're on vacation in Florida you don't think there's a church around there's a church on every corner yeah just going through worship the Lord it's okay let your light shine and so I heard I was taken to church and he was he was thankful you know well life goes on and early June of 63 he's gonna he had a service in Tucson you can hear it on tape and so first time I'm seeing this you know now in the meantime he didn't give me a big stack of tapes to listen to he didn't give me an hour read this book no he just he could see that there was a seat in there there was gonna blossom out you know eventually and so he was very patient and so here I'm in this service and for the first time I'm seeing the ministry Wow different you know we don't do this the Baptist Church but it's all Bible there you couldn't you couldn't couldn't stick a pin anywhere and so I remember going home that night and and I said Lord this is either just straight from you or it's the greatest deception ever hit the planet you know but it was of God and God began to you know open my mind and to see that it's all Bible and of course I here I am the firstborn of this missionary family and they've got plans that I should go to Bible School and go in the same steps that they've been in and you know and here I'm taking this detour how others start wringing their hands what do we do you know of course they knew this name see I never heard that name before I did you know a lot of people today don't know about the name of William Branham well I had never heard that name so I wasn't scared of him and in here I was dating his daughter and my parents well they're trying to be nice because they know it's real they could see the reality of it but yet they can't just pitch in with it because they're good Baptist you know you got relatives like that and so they had a little bit of problem with that but when he was home he would take time to explain things you know we could talk about scriptures and things he loved to talk about the scriptures so he was a real friend and I was always welcome at their house I didn't have to sneak in the back door and come to the front door you know and so you might say well what attracted you to this ministry well it wasn't sitting in the benches watching the miracles you know I enjoyed that but what I saw in it was the fact that by the time I met this man I had already read my entire Bible twice now you can read your Bible this year if you just get your priorities straightened up they got they got a list over there at the Bible bookstore it's on the Internet you read certain verses every day by Christmas you've read it all so I had done that and he enjoyed reading or talking about the scriptures so what I saw in this man was somebody that was actually living the spirit of the Scriptures not because he went to Bible School but because it was real God was living through the man you know and so that's that was what I tracked me to this and so in like in 64 I think it was that I I wrote my letter you know resignation to the Baptist Church thank you very much but take my name off I got better things to do and so of course I enjoyed seeing the supernatural I wasn't trying to figure out how to do it it's just a blessing but the fact that it was the same spirit because you know brother Branham says you want to God read your Bible and pray we might get into that tomorrow with some more clues you know but one thing that I learned along the way was what I call the prophetic dimension now we have the scriptures where where Elijah and his his helper they're you know they were in the house and he says then go outside and see what's going on it goes out there there's all these horsemen all these soldiers and guns you know their spears and things and he comes banks is all we got a problem and all these people out there and now I didn't get all upset and smack him no he just put his hand on it the Lord opened young man's eyes and so he goes back out all those angels come from they were there all the time it's another dimension you know we can't see in that dimension because we're not geared for it but it is real and so brother Brent lived in that dimension over half of his time you go come you know and so because he was built that way so it's just something faster than the bench were in now but for example when he was in in Houston in the in the meeting there in January of 1950 it was a 10-day meeting and during this time there was the Baptist preacher that thought it was his job to prove that this was all false and that nobody should be listening and no they could've been a bunch of noise so brother Bosworth who's helping brother Branham at the time said that you know we need to we need to answer this man when you do it we need to do something because people are getting upset and brother Brent said no we're not gonna waste one night on one guy when hundreds need to be prayed for him and so brother Bosworth finally convinced him that he could handle it very carefully so brother Brent said okay go ahead and but don't you know so doesn't get ugly so fine so they they program this this meeting and where they had a building for eight thousand now they got a building for thirty thousand because a lot of people came to town to back up divine healing you know they want to see the show you know well the the night of the meeting brother Branham was gonna stay in hotel okay you guys take care of that I'll be back tomorrow well but the Holy Ghost says no you must go okay so he goes to church him and his brother and his wife and little Rebekah four years old hmm very important so they're going there now he says he disguised himself somehow I don't know what he looked like or what he did but somehow he got in there nobody knows him he goes way up in the balcony where he can see down the aisle and he's up there with his family and so this is going on down here and on the platform and we're kind of putting several tapes together to get the whole story here but he was up there watching and on the platform brother Bosworth says to the to the Baptist he said now I've got one question the 7 compound names of Jehovah in the Old Testament a Redemption can we place those on Jesus Christ yes or no Oh think about this if I say no then there's no salvation and if I say yes that incorporates divine healing so he was a little bit of a bind you know well they had their bit of an argument and so finally at the end brother Bosworth says I believe are the rims in the building somewhere so he can come down and dismiss the audience so when he gets up now first of all you got to remember Rebecca is 4 years old it's the first time that she had sat with her dad in church all the other services she's sitting there with her mom and these other little girls who sit another daddy's lap her daddy's up here so here she is proud as all get-out you know and so then he gets up to come down here well he puts her in his seat and so she could see down here you know and so he comes down carefully he says on tape that there were so many sick people there he said cases that would make the heart or an Iron Man melt that's pretty serious that's not toothache you know and so um he said in 500 Usher's made a way for me to get down here okay well he gets down here and of course they had the professional photographers over here taking pictures because the Baptist was supposed to win and pictures would be the proof and you know he's right so they're taking pictures well as he's speaking the pillar fire comes in now on some tapes he sounds like there were some people that saw it but most of them didn't but we have the picture so when these guys go to develop their film that's the only picture they came out amazing okay so time goes on years later Rebecca's listening to the tape like like you would and she says to her mom now you know mom I was there and you were there did you see those five hundred Usher's I didn't see them and her mom says those weren't rushers those were angels well that's interesting so so then brother Branham you know he tells later he says you know the it's it's best if you have the picture because the real thing could come in here you guys could fool you so it's best to have that picture now the people that make fun of it well they're just signing their ticket to go somewhere else you know and there's one to tape or I think two or three occasions when he tell them tell us about this that he's got this lady coming in the prayer line and she's got her picture that she bought out front you know her Bible and he says oh I see you have a picture so he starts talking to her about the picture to establish the you know the relationship there in the discernment and he says um you know I've got a I've got a testimony on my desk at home where this lady was in the hospital and she was dying but she had that picture on the nightstand and by the hospital bed and the lady's testimony is that as she was praying the light comes off the picture came over her and she was healed went home now that's happened a lot of times throughout these last 50 years in different places so it is quite important but that's just one one case of the prophetic dimension where he could see things that you can't see brother Brennan explains that for example I see a prophet is also a seer so a seer can can look and see things and come back and tell us like when there's a big construction site they don't want people you know nose in and getting in a way they put the big fence around well a prophet seer can couldn't look over the fence and see this stuff okay now the challenge is I got to go back and tell these people but how much of this do I tell them and what words do I use and so that's what this message is all about where brother bran was relating to you what the whole picture is about okay there was another occasion when in 1960 when is when his mother-in-law died now we all know that the mother-in-law his most precious person because of one for the mother-in-law we wouldn't have the beautiful wife right okay so the mother-in-law dies and so there they have the funeral of course wanted to be the good husband you know do everything right he's got his wife there and she's crying you know at the house and he said well honey what's wrong well bill she's so far away and everything he says no look I can't open your eyes you just have to believe me she's sitting right there on the sofa they're always far away is you want to put them in another place he says when you when you die and go to heaven you've got a million miles away right there just another dimension I'm saying well on December 29th of 1963 I visited the random Tabernacle for the first time and because you know when you're in love now we're all in love with her wife right you should be I'll come back with marriage counseling but when you're in love and your girl goes away for two weeks it's like five years just as you can see the end of it so I hitched a ride here they're either going away for Christmas in 1963 and so I hitched driving some other believers and I showed up you know Sunday morning the church and so he's preaching and and so then during the lunch time you know between services we went to lunch and and of course he knew that we Rebecca and I both were in music program at school and they in a church so he said look George tonight at the service I want you to sing me sing at the brand of tabernacle yeah I want you to say well what would I say well we're gonna have a prayer line tonight so it'd be nice if you sang that song then Jesus came well I've never heard that song and Rebecca had never played it but we learned it and you know she played and I sang that night he was very proud that his little girl had played in church because she was playing a lot of classical music and so here she was in church but anyway then he came out and preached look away to Jesus yeah well time goes on 1964 we graduated from high school together and it's very proud day because you know here our parents were sitting there together and a whole thing about graduation and he said finally a brand of us graduated because before that they were all they've quit school and went to work you know so here one graduate is very very proud day for him in July of 64 you can hear the tape of the mighty God unveiled in Philadelphia now when you went to church with brother Branham you know when you rode in the car then you would get there and church is already going on he would come in time to you know preach she's not going to be there for all the preliminaries so when they get there well it's it's it's brother Branham and Billy Paul and then Rebecca and her friend Betty well so they get here and there's no chairs so it was a big hotel so up in the Meza net you know like in the Florida half up there they had some like a railing so they put some chairs up there so Rebecca and her friend they sat up there and watched so when brother n came in it had a big long table and all Roberts were speaking before he did so brother brems sits down beside him you know beside the beside the podium and while brother Roberts is speaking brother bran reaches out and just kind of touches his coach you know and so then he gets up and preaches that mighty message and so then as they're leaving to go back to the hotel Rebecca says I saw what you did and he said oh assist that was the nicest coach you know probably some $1000 sitting at the time and he looked down he had on his his you know 2995 from Sears and the coat didn't match the pants you know what it wasn't supposed to be like your pastor I mean that we did this on purpose but but his visit was just a shade different one was darker brown or whatever and he felt kind of embarrassed but the point is the they're both ministers both both sent from God but one had a gift the other one actually had something to say but the appearance wasn't all that great he just had to say something yeah it's not a message whereas old Roberts had to have everything just perfect and all gold-plated and everything and it was a gift but it wasn't to perfect the bride you know so some of those things that that you know I learned along the way another place you'll find where brother M says now he was in a big High School Auditorium you know big curtains behind him and at the end of the service he said now I want to show you the reason for the success of these meetings which everybody thinks it's the great gift and because he's a prayer warrior which is true but he said I want to show you the reason so they really stood the curtains and back here behind the curtains was old John Ryan out there stretched out praying yeah so those are some of the things that that I learned along the way and it just makes the message more real you know now we do have to say a few things about the courtship it or I can tell you all the secrets we couldn't have dates during the week because we were in school you know and when we did go out and she had been by 11 o'clock and so I think it was either the first of the second date that you know we've been out and they come home and so they lived you know you know an apartment and so I just kind of there's no traffic you know 10:30 at night so I just kind of eased up parked on the wrong side of the road and so we're just sitting there talking a little bit well here comes this car with the bright lights on and so I blast the bright lights and the lights go down wouldn't you know it it's brother branham holding right behind me in part you know he had a lot of grace but you know a lot of people found out that he had a telephone obviously you know but back then we didn't have the wireless and we didn't have our little little friends there you know home and so we only lived a block and a half away but we still like talk on the phone just what people are and so at my house we had the black phone on the wall with a dial you know and he had to kind of see wouldn't be the best time because my dad had this of course raising all his kids he said now look the telephone is not for visiting telephone is only for communication okay got it but when he needed to visit that was different so I had to kind of gauge my time when I could use it you know so at the prophets house brother branham's house they had they had the phone but it was the touchstone you come out with that now wow that's nice but it's still stuck to the wall you didn't have the wireless and so a lot of people found out his number and they would call for everything I mean he had a lot of patience because you know I don't care what color car you buy or you got to think we'll go to the dentist you know there's some common sense that he used but he was really nice but you don't he got fed up too so he's looking at the phone one day well on the bottom of the phone there was this dial he could turn if you turn to one way the ringer got louder if you turned guiltily it the ringer goes off well guess what he turned it off so when when somebody's calling you can hear ringing here but you can't hear ringing over there because it's turned off and he he just had the idea that well they'll figure it out and they'll call Billy Paul get an appointment you know they're supposed to but Rebecca says well what are we going to do you know I said it's real simple you set your watch just like mine right there okay now I'll see the things are okay at my house but you know it's seven o'clock I'm gonna call you now phone's not gonna ring thanks to your dad but if at seven o'clock you pick it up I'll be there so she'd pick it up and you know real quietly cuz nobody heard the phone ring hello and so I had this big little long cord so she'd go off and hide in the closet we could have some privacy so love conquers all now I had this like say had this 59 Ford truck okay it was not brand new but it was clean you know well Road ramen is kindness he said where he's my car well he had this 1955 Cadillac brought along as this building is wide you know and it had a big v8 engine and we had to buy the expensive gas for it yeah thirty-six cents a gallon we could put twenty-two cents a mike truck you know and okay the reason he had this Cadillac he wasn't a person he liked a car that would be functional he traded his Ford station wagon every two years because of high mileage he liked something that's gonna work well the Christian businessmen bless their heart they thought that he should have a Cadillac he kept on no I don't want a Cadillac well brother organ bride who is the International treasurer of the organization he would get his new Cadillac every year you know October or so and so when he was getting DLitt when he got delivery of his 1956 Cadillac he got two of his flunkies they said no take this car from California driver to Jeffersonville and don't talk to nobody just give them the keys and come home okay so they take the car and they take it over there and and so brother Ren comes home the week or so later Wow where'd this car so he puts it in the garage you don't nobody see it it puts in the garage is there for like six months until he put a little piece in the paper yeah I'm gonna be driving this blue and white car and it's not bought with your money there was a gift and kind of disclaimer read on well so that's what they drove out to Arizona along with the station wagon and so we could you know we take it on a date well it's huge car and so you know with the expensive gas but that we could drive it to church and things you know news it was nice and flashing but Rebecca told him one time about being in a restaurant they were in a restaurant eating lunch one day and so as they're sitting there with over to another table was a policeman and he had ordered his food so what by the time is just as his food is coming to the table his radio started blasting and he was needed so he dropped everything and took off the lights flashing and so everybody's kind of nervous and brother Graham said it's nothing to worry about over there a few blocks little boy fell out of a tree and broke his arm he's gonna be okay so Rebecca said no we knew that everybody's daddy didn't do that yeah but okay we come to May of 16 in 1964 the Lord showed him that you're gonna stay here you know you need to find a house and settle down here in Arizona so he started looking for a place and he said the Holy Ghost directed him right to the just one house it's on a cul-de-sac and this old fella had built these three houses and not finished and then kind of a what'd he call it where you finish it yourself gonna get a better price well you I'll expect homes so he he saw this house and instead of the eaves going off you know like this building here where it blocks the view the eaves went up in other words there was a slanted roof and you can see the mountain so well so he liked that and it had space out there to build on the dinner room that he always wanted so he really liked it and so as they're making the deal he's standing in the doorway looking out in the the builders the outside looking in they're standing there talking well Joseph's about seven or eight years old at the time and so he's running his finger up the door jamb you know like kids do and headed for the you know the where the lock goes in so brother Bray understand they're talking and as he's talking he reaches in takes out his knife keeps talking to a man he just sticks there in that hole he comes out with a scorpion and joseph was headed right for it you know so that's that other dimension see he knew it was there he knew how to get to it a lot of that kind of stuff happened a lot of times there was a case when in Jeffersonville the church that one of the members live next door to a church Christ man so he's always asked him you need to come to my church this Sunday you don't come well finally one Sunday the church Christ man says okay I'll go with you tonight so they come to church and it was communion night okay so closed communities when it's just us well open can be used if you say you're a Christian you've received the Lord then you can come down have communion also if you don't even go here so they have open communion and so they're all you know that rose standing there taking the communion and this mr. Hill the church Christ man his testimony is that as he's standing there with his friend and you know in the communion line he heard brother Neville say to brother Branham brother Branham we ran out of wine what we're gonna do that's kind of embarrassing you know and so brother Brent says well we'll just pray that's no problem so mr. Hill you kept one eye open see what's going on and so as brother brems praying the little church little glasses filled up with wine not from water from nothing you know and so so then we get into 1965 I get the may of 65 okay I didn't have I didn't have a job I didn't have a car I didn't have a house didn't have any money but I thought I needed a wife you know I was young I've learned a few things these years but anyway so I go up to talk to brother bran of course had to figure out when he's home when he's not real busy you know on stuff and so we go in we talked for a while and just the two of us and so he's tell me all about the meetings and all the different places he's been the bunch of stuff and so finalists in the program this is all wonderful but I've come without you know particularly thing I wanna talk about oh hold that be well he's looking right through me you know and I said well you must have noticed that I really like your daughter and I'd like them I'm here to ask for your permission your blessing that we could get married oh then things changed he said no look I'm gonna give you permission to be engaged but don't even think about marriage until you both have the baptism the Holy Ghost because you see all these other cases around here well let it be a lesson well from that I've come up with a saying today that I tell girls everywhere there's worse things than going through life single just look around okay well so that was in May and then in June they took off again for the summer you know jeffersonville and that's when he preached the anointed ones at the end time I was sitting like from here to the Oregon Washington preach that but it's just going over you know years later when it started make sense and so I you know again I hits back there and so I was there for a couple of weeks when he's preaching some of these messages so we come down to April first I'm sorry August first which was a Sunday and I knew we were going to be going to to back to Tucson I was gonna ride with him going back and I said you know I asked him that Sunday afternoon I said now would it be possible that there's time for you to baptize me correctly before we go back to Arizona oh sure well he'd been waiting almost three years for that you know and so there was a he was glad to do it well so we go down Monday morning and he asked his brother brother doc to get few witnesses to be sitting out there and so we come into the back street he didn't have a shirt on he's a little bit embarrassed because a couple of ladies there and so he baptized me correctly in the tabernacle well it turns out that's the last person he baptized we didn't know that then you know and so now we're back in Tucson August of sixty-five and by then I had the baptism I had the girl you know pretty much secured and and and had a car a nice car used cars and so we're driving around one day in the car and I don't know how we got to the subject but he says no George if you ever get the opportunity to go to Israel your Bible will be a brand-new book well that's interesting but I wasn't thinking about Israel I'm saying about the girl it got to be honest so sure enough eight years later after a whole lot of things happen we went the first time in Israel Wow the Bible's real here's what happened you know here's Sea of Galilee here's all this all these things and so he was I think he was seeing something wasn't just you know vain words he was seeing something then get me started well so I went the first time in 73 and in 1984 we started taking you know small group so this past November at strip number 37 so we know where everything is and how many wants your pastor to go [Laughter] we're gonna have to do better than that but it's it's a real blessing to go over there now fact his brother Bram never went Israel there's no evidence they everywhere now he'd read about it he knew people from there but when we're over there and when we might no play a portion of a tape or something well the Israeli guide says he was never here huh he talks like somebody's been here a hundred times he's describing things in detail you know and so he says yeah he's a prophet no doubt yeah so the he's seen these stuff by vision so when you hear him tell things on tape he's not making it up now he wasn't a religious person but he was he was a natural-born Irish storyteller they can get into the colors and you're right in the driver's seat but he's seen things he's seeing all those things well in September of 65 we were in the meeting and in Phoenix because he preached a lot of times in Phoenix for the Christian businessman well so at this meeting in Phoenix sister Rebecca had a real good friend her name is back then was sure and Riley and so Sharon's dad was a song leader or something and so they were friends a similar age and so Rebecca comes into the big hotel lobby there where the meeting was and she's flashing her ringing on and and so Sharon says but Rebecca he's Baptist or she fell to tell that guy she was seeing was an atheist but and so Rebecca says yeah but Danny likes him there's the end of the argument you know excuse me ma'am well the fact is that in September of 65 I'll see all during since since the beginning 65 they're working on this house but in the carpet and painting a bunch of different things well brother Perry greens mother living in Beaumont Texas was a seamstress so she got involved making all the drapes for the house so in September brother Perry was out in Tucson putting it the drapes and have had some services so brother Branham says to him not to me but he said to brother Perry it looks like this kid's gonna be my son-in-law why don't you take him home and pray for the Holy Ghost now why didn't brother Brennan just put his hand on me be done with it it wasn't God's plan God has a way of doing things and only he can arrange the details so brother Greene says so are you working no well come on home with me well how many of you knew brother Perry yeah well the way he would tell things sound like he had this big ranch you know he had nothing we we get down there and he lived in three rooms behind the church you know so anyway my room didn't have air conditioning that's when I learned about humidity Beaumont Texas summertime and so about the second or third day that I was there brother Richard Blair came over from Louisiana to use brother Perry's phone to call brother Branham about some problem so when he called in brother brand was already out of the house but they promised when he comes back he'll call you so these two guys are sitting there by the phone waiting most of the day I was over in my room reading my Bible and so at some point I thought yeah but it was thought to be praying maybe we could just pray together I didn't know why it was there nobody told ah nobody told me I was there I was just there as a visitor and I thought it'd be good if we prayed so we go into the Sunday School room we kneel down at a branch we're praying and while we're praying it seemed like that the sky was was you know when it's cloudy and then there's the rays of light come down through the clouds well that's what it seemed like I could see in my mind you know and so one of these rays is coming to me well just within a half a minute the phone rings well so we were finished praying so brother green goes answers phone and it's brother Branham calling for the Blair but he said but first let me talk to George so I took the phone and greeted him he said Oh George let me be the first in congratulating you on receiving the baptismal Holy Ghost oh so that's what that was and he knew that was he knew I was pretty hard-headed you know and he was helping me out to identify what had happened well so all these years later it's not so much his words about it but the fact that God is actually doing something and it's better every day you know well so I was that was one of them so it's in Texas well the next day I get a letter from my mother or a call from my mother in Tucson and she had a letter from President Johnson that they needed me in the US Army oh okay so I went back home flew home and within a week I was a soldier with Holy Ghost so God does everything right on time you know yeah and well so I'm in a diamond down there in Louisiana and in Fort Polk and then in the army and brother brems preaching in November there in Shreveport so Rebecca come down we went up there to the meetings well on Saturday I had a few minutes with him now at that point I was just a just finishing basic training I didn't know what they were gonna do with me if I was gonna be you know what and and there's some hot spots on the earth you know there was Selma Alabama and there was Watts California and there was Vietnam and so I you know whatever God wanted I didn't care but I just you know I just wanted him to pray so I'm just talking to him he didn't even pray he said don't worry footsteps of the righteous ordered of the Lord well the burden rolled off I got back to the army they made me a cook so I could I can take care of me and a few others you know well so that was November of 65 and then then in December well then the family's gonna house is finished now still an apartment so the family is going to go back to two of Indiana for the Christmas holidays but they're gonna leave Rebecca in Tucson to move all the stuff into the new house so when they come back from Jeffersonville they go right to the new house that was the plan so I was home for like two weeks for Christmas from from the army and so brother brems gonna leave now when he travelled he'd like to leave early he didn't care everybody goes to sleep all day he wants to get there so at six o'clock he's moving and and so another thing is that he if he was traveling by himself or was a Billy Paul he was just wear some blue jeans and boots or something you know didn't matter but if he's traveling with the family he'd dress up a little better you know find her clothes and another thing is that when he when he packed his suitcase the Bible is always the last thing in because he says on tape nothing goes on top of a brother that's God's and print and we don't put nothing on top so I wasn't gonna get him at five o'clock and go say goodbye I was gonna go in the night before you know so I went up the evening before and so I'm in the room with him and and I noticed on the chair by the door was the was the the blue jeans it was rougher clothes and such was his way of doing things that I had to ask why why is this how come he wear these clothes well a guy never knows when he might have car trouble well I knew that this guy never had car trouble because he kept it in perfect condition so I didn't say anything he didn't say anything but within 24 hours he was in a bad head-on collision in West Texas and so we were out eating it we were guests at brother Perry house that evening when we got the call and so on Sunday we flew over there you know because the wreck happened on Saturday evening so on Sunday we flew over and we were there at the hospital and he was in intensive care and had to trake Ian's they couldn't talk at the head bandaged there's a pretty bad situation and the of course there's people everywhere you know there's quite a few people there was no cell phone so they're putting coins in the phone and reporting back home what they seen heard and a lot of opinions going on and oh it can't happen and this and that well I'm just watching all this and so I'm in the intensive care where he was there was 12 beds and I got in to see him once because you'd only be in there like five minutes you know and so after during the days that he was there all the other eleven beds got well moved on but on the evening of December 24th God said that's enough took him home and it was very traumatic we didn't expect that but God knows what he's doing because while he was here we were just going to this meeting and that meeting and watching nobody's paying attention what he said you know the church age book had just come out and it came out in December and he left within 30 days so wasn't even people studying that yet and there was there was no folios there was no computer you know these big old tapes and and it goes by you think you heard something and maybe you didn't you didn't well anyway he he definitely suffered a lot but God had a plan you know and the fact that he left on that day well that was God's plan we were like the disciples wouldn't despondent know now what I'm gonna do nobody's could take its place you know that's when we had to get Benny you know get serious every guy that's got to pray for himself now we got to get serious okay what did he actually say I mean it's glorious message from God well let's see what he said but he said right on this one tape said you're going to find out one of these days that when you go to heaven you don't fly off somewhere else you're still right here just in another dimension faster than this okay so then they they transported the body over to Jeffersonville and we flew over there I couldn't stay for the funeral because it wasn't a blood relative I had to get back to the army so on the December 29th they had the funeral but sister Brandon was hurt so bad in the accident she couldn't decide whether the burial should be in Tucson or in Jeffersonville you know there's no life out there or what the church is and so the funeral director said don't worry I can play shank take care of you know when you all decide then we'll have a burial well you know the word says in 2nd Timothy 1:7 for God has not given us the spirit of fear but of power love and a sound mind and in Philippians and the peace of God which passes all understanding all past all the things you can understand shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus so we learn to listen and we learned to pray and I wasn't there they're there they're out there by their self you know I was far away in the army and so God was on the scene and then so I mean I mean you know the army learned how to cook which it's a whole other story but they're good recipes just got people don't care you know so when I'm finishing the cook school part then I've got my papers where I'm going next well I knew God had done something for me and I knew God Sutton did something for Rebecca so I thought now's the time to pop the question I stood in line at the army base but my quarters in called her and I said hey yeah let's get married next Tuesday ok let's do it so I went home and we had a private ceremony at the house with the families and then we took off on a honeymoon back to Jeffersonville where they've got the burial planned for Monday August the 11th there April the 11th and so we're there for that now that Monday was a rainy day okay and Billy Paul had always kept a relationship with his grandmother sister hopes mother but she was a very difficult person very hard never went to church never saw her cry just you know well those kind of grandmas so when he's going to the burial he takes his two little boys and leaves him with his grandmother while he goes with his wife to the burial just a couple blocks away and it's raining so when he comes back to pick up his little boys for the first time he sees grandma wiping her face she said even the heavens weep for that man so we left that day flew to California and on the 15th of April I flew off to Vietnam for one year no phone no Skype no vacation only letters so when you get a letter oh oh I get those letters not to smell let me know there were two me there weren't all those other guys I'd golf someplace now to open up room read it myself I could read between the lines if that was the only communication we had these guys today they got skypes like they're living across the street you know so anyway I came back from the Army and I finally got out in October of 67 and immediately went to work with translating the message for spoken word got busy with translation process and I didn't know a lot of you know I didn't know everything at that point I had to I had to do some studying and okay the accident goes here the comma goes here and you know to make something readable for all those people out there that want to know what he said it's one thing to open your Bible yeah God says you sent a prophet well there is okay what do you say well if you don't have anything to give them you know so missionary working incorporates a lot of stuff so um and we're not like the the people that come to buy - to your door you know I'm talking about we're not out to get everybody in this church we're just looking for those Eagles that are out there don't know there he goes and so the life is what shows they want to know why do you have long hair well don't be telling brother Graham said so that's no that's that's not that's not a good answer you got to go on first Corinthians you got to know this scripture says we are scripture believers and see when we go to Israel here we are here's the the the Orthodox ladies they dress just like you they have a nice long here all the little girls have pleated skirts beautiful people and then there's all these stupid Christians that are dressed any which way you know and then there's us so they wonder who are you people you look like our people so I finally realized the right answer we are the Orthodox of the Protestants oh okay yeah okay so we're married like saying that was March 30th of 1966 and so then I was gone okay okay so gonna fast-forward 40 years okay now we moved over to Tennessee in 1999 and so within a couple of years Rebekah start developing what ended up being a tumor so she finally found a doctor that would take care of it and so she had a cancer operation and she's very sick so the tumor was attached to the kidney so when they took the kidney and the tumor out her besides a football so then she only had one kidney well this went on and by 2006 she was quite ill she had been through three or four major operations and you got to realize this wasn't just somebody down the street this is a lady that had been living with William Brannon for 20 years she knew what faithless you know what miracles were and so but I can see that each day things were getting worse when everything could medically and everybody was praying you know and so I said no look you know that God could heal you but you'd like new you know what miracles are but if God chooses to take you then you just get with your dad wait for me there okay well within a few days we had a call from a sister back in West Virginia and friend of the family and so she said you know today I was getting up from lunch and it's getting up from the table and there was a vision right there you know and she said in this vision I can see brother Brandon preaching and all these people he's preaching faith and there's prayer line everything's going on and in the midst of it he points to me yeah one dimension to the other a new little sister thank you for praying for my daughter Rebecca until George not to worry everything's gonna be okay well then you start paying attention you know and so and he said you know Hebrews 13:8 is still in effect yeah well sure enough October went by November 28th the Lord called her home we have the funeral on December 4th and I remember saying Lord you see my situation keep me busy keep me balanced keep me focused so we've been very busy and trying to stay focused on the resurrection and stay balanced because there's all kinds of things to you know take off and so God knows what he's doing and you know for every one of us there's a line in the road someplace now we don't know where it is we've heard about a guy that died at 22 years old this morning that's terrible some people you know if you get the paper you know they didn't all die 96 and so there's a line for each one of us you just got to stay ready you see and we won't go past that line now we were married for just over 40 years and three children got three grandchildren and we moved to several different places but the fact is that the missionary work is still going on there's a lot of work to do you know I was over in Africa a few years ago here's the church huge Church Sunday School 4700 people present that's 4700 Bibles 250 oh man we gotta help these poor people you know so I was talking to the pastor he said no look you see this church we're building this church capacity 7,000 people this is with our money we have money and it's not drywall it's all over enforce concrete so there's plenty of money here he said and they sell Bibles right there these people can't read because when they're 78 years old they're already out there scratching for diamonds it's such an area you can't just buy a ticket and go there you have to have a letter invitation stamped and sealed to even buy your ticket in the first place so very interesting area well anyway so I'm preaching to these 6,000 people on Sunday because more came in you know it's kind of like here they weren't all here 7 o'clock were they and so we sold like 6,000 people and speaking through a translator and so as soon as we finished the pastor jumps up he says now wooden brother George is coming back but does anybody have any questions you can imagine so they started giving their questions and in the translation and translation of the question they were no hurry to go didn't matter if I was starving they didn't they weren't hurry and so the only question I remember this one sister passed up a question well since the Lord took your wife why you still wearing the ring they notice everything you know and so I said that's because my commitment to Rebekah wasn't until death do you part is for eternity okay okay so God is definitely keeping us busy there's a lot to do but my humble advice for you married people make her laugh at you every day just keep her happy I didn't always do it but it's the way it works and you know people are watching your life they were their watch and they see what happens you know and we see that there was people in brother Browns day that that caused him a lot of grief because they thought he was Jesus Christ and they even start baptized in his name and bunch of stuff well and we want to kind of put them down but is anybody confused you with Jesus Christ this week if they Wow there goes an angel you know so the scripture says by this shall all men know that you're my disciples it's not if you weren't across not if you got a certain belt buckle know the life and the love you have one to the other so they're watching as we have loved one of the other they know that Christ is with us now I got a friend out in in Arizona he doesn't speak very good English at all so we always communicate in Spanish but he called me one one Sunday morning or earlier it was then summertime there's three hours difference and so he was crying I said what's wrong and he said well I just woke up I had this had this dream and said in this dream I was in heaven I was talking about LeBron him we were talking sin away he doesn't speak Spanish you don't speak English yeah but we were communicating real well so it's another language some kind and so we were talking and he said that as they were talking he was noticing it right there with brother Brown was this girl you kept looking at her Wow that's Rebecca and she gave him big smile on she said you tell George I'm right where he told me to wait though it is real yeah so we'll talk more about the missionary work tomorrow maybe his Lord tarries but it's wanted to share this one quote here with you brother Roman says years ago there was a writer Fanny Crosby and she was blind and she didn't sell her birthright to the world she you know she was a different kind of woman and said they came to see her one day and they said why don't you write modern poetry and write songs for in the entertainment world and she said I give all my talent to God oh you believe that there'll be a heaven and that you're gonna be there oh yeah yeah I'm going I'll be there and he said when you get there if you're still blind how will you know him she said I'll feel the nail scars in his hands and she got up went into the other room and then when she did she raised her hands and begin to praise God and when those people have left in other words you know that mustard changed did a song struck her she said I shall know him I shall know him and redeem by his side I shall stand of course we all know the song he says and today brother sister she's walking the streets of glory with far better sight than anybody on earth ever had she sees him she knows him and is standing redeemed by his side and if I would ask her tonight Fanny Crosby what does Christ mean to you now he said she would sing this song for me something like this past me not the gentle Savior that's what he means to the believer so if the song leader can come up and help us musicians will sing that song past me not o gentle Savior and Lord bless you and we will see you back here tomorrow Lord willing pass mean arnold gentle say maybe you're [Music] my home [Music] and why ah [Music] they're what call me too

never so we ride [Music] ah Oh [Music] Oh [Music] No hallelujah why don't you stand with me tonight Amen whatever your need is fall out to him now [Music] I [Music] [Music] and why Oh [Music] praise the name of the Lord you know I was preaching and some services here back in the first the other part of last year and was a brother I walked into his office and I seen this this little the picture that he had and I said man I really liked that and he said I had that made and I said man I really like that he said well you know what you can take it with you I wonder what I loved on it was is there as it said it says we don't change the message the message changes us you see we we speak of this and this terminology message seems to be a new that terminology and you know people in the world and the church will say well what do you mean about message but the reality is it's not a new message it's the same original message of Calvary it's the message of the true atonement it's not what has God all mixed up and polluted and convoluted with things but it's the same original message and that is of God's life being placed back inside the worshiper aren't you grateful to God amen that our eyes have been opened that God would bring us back into a place to where we can have a real relationship with him you know it's it's one of the things the Bible says that that in they that call upon the name of the Lord they shall be saved but how can they how can they call in whom they have not heard how can they call in whom they have not heard they they must hear first of all and to think of that that ministering of the name is not just saying the name of Jesus Christ but it's that living person his character that's his name when that comes down there's no mistaking of them something of an imagination it's his life it's him that's being introduced aren't you glad aren't you glad it's not it's not some idea of a man that we introduced - no no this this messaging is not the ideas of William Brennan this message is a message of the expressed thoughts of Jehovah that's exactly what it is amen ministering to you and I and you know what means something to you and I because we were and our thoughts of God it's not something that we can explain we can't explain why we believe it oh well you know by the salmon I believe it because I've read it and this makes sense that's all intellectual that's all intellectual God doesn't make sense I'll just put it to you like that it's not something that makes sense we don't become believers because it makes sense there's a necessary step but we are believers true believers when we have been born of the supernatural that's where it becomes a living reality within us aren't you grateful you know the Bible says in mark chapter 16 I'm not gonna preach but in mark 16 it says he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but you know that baptize there is not just talking about water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that's the same word that's used when my candor would use it when it says by one spirit we are all baptized into one body that's a baptism up here there's men that can stand here and they can put you down as you submit to it but there's only one that can put you in the body by the spiritual baptism and that's Almighty God himself aren't you glad he's never too busy he's never missed one baptism he's never had the Deacons do it he's never had other men it's only him that can do this aren't you grateful for that amen the Shepherd the Prophet tells us the Shepherd is always present when they use our given birth amen don't you loving tonight and then you appreciate amen the testimony and the word of the Lord that we share amen tonight amen we certainly do we appreciate that Lord willing tomorrow night at 7 o'clock let's let's come back expecting tomorrow night at 7 amen we're just so glad to have amen brother Randy will you come dismiss us an order prayer amen so glad to have brother Randy here with us tonight amen brother Randy's just back from India and then we certainly appreciate the sacrifice amen glory to God let's bow our heads to the Lord Jesus dear Heavenly Father as our brothers were talking I was just pondering Lord the predestination the destination is a thought Lord that is much confusing to many people but Lord desire brother Smith was talking here tonight about his life story and about the events that had taken place Lord he's talking about predestination or there's nothing out of order everything is all going according to your pet plan because the Bible says that all things work amen according to those that are called Lord Jesus according to your purpose all things work to the good the only reason why we're here Lord is because you called us out of darkness the only reason why we're here in the body is because you placed us here in the body there was a Time Lord when we didn't know you but you knew was and you knew Lord the time would come that you would call us from the places that we were at as Abraham was there in ur of Chaldees you had a predestinated plan for him and you called the amount of herb telling him that there's another place that I want you to be you brought him into that promised land and there in that land Lord Jesus is where he stood and met you and you revealed yourself to him you have done the same thing for us Lord and we're so grateful we're grateful that you came to us Lord and that you didn't pass us by but you came into our lives the draw is closer to you thank you Lord Jesus thank you for this time to be in the house of God thank you for this time Lord Jesus of your love and mercies to us we pray Lord you blessed this assembly bless the pastor best our brother george smith's the lord in other testimonies we've heard Lord are our hearts have been touched by the events that we've heard even in recent times we pray Lord God that you'll continue to walk with us and guide us Lord have your well done in our hearts and lives as we commit ourselves into thy hands and the lovely name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen you say cancel one another's you're being dismissed in the name of the Lord they may God bless you tomorrow night at 7 o'clock [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] she says son [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] spread your way [Music] don't let your
