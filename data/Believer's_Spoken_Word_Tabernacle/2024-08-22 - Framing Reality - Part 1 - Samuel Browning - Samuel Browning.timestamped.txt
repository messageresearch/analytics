[33:43] for um be sister Irma and uh sister
[33:47] Carmen uh their father and as well as
[33:52] his brother Carlos's father-in-law and
[33:54] so um they had asked if if I would do
[33:57] the service and so uh we're going to
[34:00] have it here uh it won't it won't be a
[34:03] viewing or anything like that of the
[34:04] body it'll just be a service that we
[34:07] will have here and so we want to
[34:10] continue to keep them in prayer as well
[34:12] as a family uh through this time that
[34:15] the Lord would continue to strengthen
[34:16] them as well as that the Lord would just
[34:19] continue to move and and to deal with
[34:22] hearts as well and we're so thankful to
[34:24] know that we do have a comforter amen
[34:27] and I I still never I tell you since the
[34:31] time when my when my dad had passed away
[34:33] you know many times I had entered in you
[34:36] know you enter in to pray for others
[34:38] who's lost and you can feel it there are
[34:41] many that have went on from the assembly
[34:43] right here that my it just so it gripped
[34:46] me and would touch me in such a way uh
[34:48] but I never forget the part that when my
[34:51] dad when the Lord had taken my dad and I
[34:53] you know you just I was in complete
[34:55] shock I was just numb and uh
[34:58] but I never forget it was a few mornings
[35:01] two or three about three or four
[35:02] mornings
[35:03] later I remember when I woke up that
[35:05] morning and when I woke up it was a
[35:08] release and I looked over and I touched
[35:10] my wife I said honey I said this is the
[35:13] prayers of the Saints and I never forget
[35:16] that it was so Supernatural of that and
[35:18] so every time now when you know you have
[35:20] experienced that in someone that has
[35:22] experienced the loss that's how I pray
[35:23] Lord do for them what you did for me
[35:26] Lord and you know it just it allows you
[35:28] to be able to pray in that manner You'
[35:30] you've been through those things and I
[35:31] know many of you have already been there
[35:33] and uh but we just want to pray and
[35:36] enter in on their behalf as well also um
[35:40] this coming weekend uh Lord willing we
[35:43] my wife and I we will be gone we have a
[35:45] a marriage banquet to minister at and
[35:47] then on a Sunday service brother Boaz
[35:49] Romero he'll be here on that on this
[35:52] Sunday to stand in for us it's kind of
[35:54] hard to get not that brother Boaz the
[35:57] second but uh it's kind of hard to get
[35:59] brother Steven now that he's
[36:01] pastoring so brother Steven had talked
[36:04] to me on the phone and you know uh he
[36:06] said Brother Sam I still would like to
[36:08] come you know to minister I said hey
[36:09] you're always welcome but I understand
[36:11] you got to get settled in the saddle but
[36:13] you know you just let me know and uh but
[36:16] we so have appreciated brother step
[36:18] being here and you know the ministry
[36:20] that God has allowed us to to bring in
[36:23] and to and it's been a blessing to our
[36:25] lives and I'm so thankful for for that
[36:28] amen so let's look here and I know i'
[36:30] we've read from this and I believe we're
[36:32] coming to the to the end here of the job
[36:35] 23 um so I want to read a few scriptures
[36:38] then we'll just let you be seated in job
[36:41] 23:1 it says then job answered and said
[36:43] even today is my complaint bitter and my
[36:47] stroke is heavier than my groaning all
[36:50] that I knew where I might find him that
[36:54] I might come even to his seat and I
[36:56] would order my cause before him and fill
[37:00] my mouth with arguments now he wasn't
[37:03] talking about being contention
[37:05] contentious but job's know knows where
[37:07] he's standing with God I there's nothing
[37:10] that I've that's kept back there's
[37:12] nothing that he hasn't asked me to do
[37:14] that I haven't done but job's asking and
[37:17] I wanted you to catch that in verse
[37:18] three when he says oh that I knew where
[37:20] I might find him that I might come even
[37:22] to his seat and I want you just to take
[37:24] a hold of that verse tonight to see that
[37:27] in theid midst of even the tests and the
[37:29] trials there is an
[37:31] immovable desire in his heart for the
[37:35] Living God Amen may God bless you and
[37:38] bless the reading of the word that's
[37:42] good in verse 5 job said I know the
[37:45] words which he would answer me in other
[37:47] words I I would understand and
[37:50] understand what he would say to me if I
[37:51] can just get in his presence that's
[37:54] where understanding will come remember
[37:57] even there was one who was the lead
[37:59] musician in David's time ASF and ASF
[38:03] remember he watched a lot of things
[38:06] taking place how the wicked would
[38:07] Prosper the Bible says even when he got
[38:11] his eyes on looking at the wicked and
[38:12] how they're prospering and and asf's
[38:14] testimony is my foot had almost slipped
[38:17] because he got the looking at the wrong
[38:19] thing but he says when I came into the
[38:21] house of God then I understood the end
[38:25] of the wicked so you know there's
[38:27] nothing like being in God's presence you
[38:29] know there's a lot of things we're
[38:31] understanding that's where understanding
[38:33] comes is you know it's times when we're
[38:35] in prayer times when we're in meditation
[38:37] even when maybe you're in the most
[38:39] obscure moment maybe you're right on the
[38:41] job you're just thinking upon the Lord
[38:43] or maybe you're doing your your daily
[38:45] activities or you come or you're in the
[38:47] house of God and that understanding
[38:49] strikes but you know just when you come
[38:51] into His presence there's understanding
[38:53] that comes to our life and a strength
[38:56] and job says in verse six will he plead
[38:58] against me with his great power no but
[39:01] he would put strength in me you see job
[39:03] knows him he he he's not going to he's
[39:05] not going to destroy me but he would
[39:08] give he would put strength in my life
[39:10] and you know the prophet would take this
[39:12] scripture over and over and and point us
[39:14] to this reality that as we come to the
[39:17] end of the trial we are actually
[39:20] strengthened and made more stronger amen
[39:24] and he goes on to talk about there the
[39:26] righteous might be dispute with him so
[39:28] should I be delivered forever from my
[39:30] judge and in verse 10 if I can just skip
[39:34] to that he says behold he knoweth the
[39:36] way that I take when he hath tried me I
[39:39] shall come forth as gold my foot hath
[39:43] held his steps his way have I kept
[39:48] that's observed and and not declined
[39:50] neither have I gone back from the
[39:52] Commandment of his lips I have esteemed
[39:55] the words of his mouth more than my
[39:59] necessary
[40:01] food now verse 16 job said for God
[40:06] maketh my heart soft and the almighty
[40:10] troubleth me remember Satan is making
[40:13] job think right that it's his God that's
[40:17] doing this to him but it isn't God doing
[40:21] it it's God permitting it is that right
[40:25] Satan's doing it and the prophet tells
[40:27] us in three kinds of Believers I think
[40:29] it's very key that in that message that
[40:31] the prophet would make that statement
[40:33] and he says as long as Jo as Satan could
[40:37] make job believe that he had him whipped
[40:40] but I want you to notice this right here
[40:43] he was still a
[40:45] Believer you cannot separate a Believer
[40:48] from his
[40:50] God you might get him confused in his
[40:52] mind you might trouble him in his Spirit
[40:55] but when that Soul has had fellowship
[40:57] with God Amen that's
[41:01] it so these are where testimonies that
[41:04] you find that even in the midst of all
[41:07] that is taking place and even the
[41:09] accusations where Satan is coming and
[41:12] job is thinking that it's God doing it
[41:14] yet you could not touch or tamper that
[41:18] desire because that desire is not
[41:21] Earthly that desire Came From Heaven it
[41:26] was deposited in his life I could read
[41:28] many scriptures more where job talks
[41:31] about my my tears I poured out before
[41:33] God his desire was
[41:38] unmovable I want you to capture that
[41:40] here in verse 17 he said because I was
[41:43] not cut off before the darkness neither
[41:46] hath he covered the darkness from my
[41:49] face he's talking about death and to see
[41:51] death and destruction all around
[41:54] me and so I want to just look at a
[41:58] thought beginning here
[41:59] tonight um because what I can see is I
[42:02] have just a couple parts on it but I
[42:04] want to deal with a thought on framing
[42:08] reality framing reality because
[42:11] sometimes realities of things and how
[42:13] things really are can seem like it wants
[42:16] to somehow Escape us but you know God
[42:19] has a way to frame reality and put it
[42:22] into to perspective there's one who
[42:25] knows our thoughts
[42:27] he knows he knows even the decisions
[42:30] that we have before us the Bible says
[42:32] and we Are Witnesses of this out of
[42:34] Hebrews 412 that the word of God is
[42:38] alive it's a discerner of the thoughts
[42:42] and intents of the heart and I'm
[42:44] grateful for that because even the
[42:46] things that we're contemplating or
[42:47] thinking on or even reasonings or
[42:50] imaginations or things that we can have
[42:52] even in our mind I'm thankful that the
[42:55] word of God comes write down and is
[42:58] there to discern and actually frame
[43:02] what's really the
[43:05] truth and so where job is at within this
[43:09] he's standing and of many scriptures we
[43:11] could uh pull from on this right here
[43:13] he's standing there's an
[43:15] unmovable Faith that's there within his
[43:19] soul but yet in the midst of it this is
[43:21] what I want to hone in on in the midst
[43:23] of it his weariness and tiredness in his
[43:28] body and his spirit is where Satan is
[43:31] beginning to Buffet him in his thinking
[43:35] you see Satan has assailed against him
[43:37] but yet you can't he couldn't turn job
[43:39] from from that rock solid confession he
[43:42] had remember job had a grip on God by
[43:45] divine revelation divine revelation of
[43:48] knowing god in a personal way does not
[43:52] mean that we understand everything
[43:54] that's going on it doesn't mean that
[43:57] fears and doubts and things cannot come
[43:59] in our mind no it only means there's an
[44:01] anchor that even when the waves come
[44:04] there's an anchor that holds us from
[44:07] within the veil hallelujah hallelujah so
[44:11] it all comes back down to the glory
[44:13] belongs to God Amen he is my anchor he's
[44:17] the one that is holding me and that's
[44:19] why Paul could write and say for I am
[44:23] persuaded that neither height nor depth
[44:27] nor life and nor Darkness nor things
[44:30] present nor things to come nothing shall
[44:34] be able to separate us from the love of
[44:37] God out of Romans 8 what a declaration
[44:40] very familiar scripture to us but
[44:42] there's a there's a Resolute notice all
[44:45] of these things can come around but
[44:47] there's I'm persuaded nothing shall be
[44:51] able to separate us from the love of God
[44:53] he didn't say I'm persuaded that nothing
[44:56] will happen around me I'm not I'm I'm
[44:58] not persuaded that I'm going to do
[45:01] everything exactly right and hit
[45:02] everything right on the mark and cross
[45:05] every tea and Dot every eye but I'm
[45:07] persuaded that in the midst of
[45:09] everything that comes that it's unable
[45:12] to be separated from the love of
[45:15] God and this is why Paul could even
[45:17] speak of the suffering that he was
[45:19] dealing with because of preaching the
[45:22] Gospel of Jesus Christ and you know
[45:25] we're witness of this when you are
[45:27] making a stand and you're you're walking
[45:29] for the Lord the Bible says that you
[45:32] know many are the afflictions of the
[45:33] righteous but the Lord delivereth out of
[45:36] them all any that live Godly in Christ
[45:39] shall suffer
[45:40] persecution and Paul Paul throughout his
[45:43] whole Ministry you find this and you
[45:46] find uh throughout every life of of
[45:48] every believer yet that within
[45:51] everything Paul could say though all of
[45:53] these things I've suffered I'm not
[45:55] ashamed right I'm not ashamed I'm not
[45:58] turning back I'm persuaded yeah I I'm
[46:02] Resolute in whom I have believed I'm
[46:05] persuaded he's
[46:07] able not that I'm able He's Able amen
[46:12] hallelujah to keep that which I've
[46:15] committed unto him against that day amen
[46:18] so this weariness that tiredness and you
[46:21] know that can come around within our
[46:24] mind when you you go through a time of t
[46:26] testing and trying Even in our lives
[46:29] sometimes just through the busyness and
[46:32] and just through the toils and and
[46:34] tormos of life we have seasons of life
[46:37] where it seems like there's not enough
[46:39] hours in the day it seems like there's
[46:42] not enough time around us and we're
[46:45] we're looking and then on top of that
[46:47] there's this situation you have to tend
[46:49] to and and then there's this situation
[46:51] and that's just simply summed up in one
[46:53] word
[46:54] life and here we are one walking in this
[46:58] life we experience Joys we experience
[47:00] disappointments and yet within it here
[47:03] as we're walking and through tests and
[47:05] trials it can come to a spot to where
[47:08] that in our very spirit in our mind in
[47:11] our body we're wearied we're weak we're
[47:14] depleted you you know anytime you ever
[47:16] go through something I think many times
[47:18] that to me is you know when I've had to
[47:20] set maybe within a hospital with my wife
[47:23] or or someone or whatever more sometimes
[47:25] even just that part part of being there
[47:28] and you're you know here you are you're
[47:29] in prayer you're on the edge of your
[47:30] seat or whatever and you can come out of
[47:32] all that and you're even a great deal
[47:34] more tired than if you physically had
[47:36] labored because
[47:38] mentally mentally and the strains and
[47:41] the tensions that that come and pressure
[47:44] is all around us and you know what just
[47:46] because that we here are a part of what
[47:49] God is doing in this end time and have
[47:51] received the Seal of the Living God
[47:52] we're not exempt from feeling pressure
[47:55] and let me just say this to you we're
[47:57] not exempt from responding in the wrong
[48:00] way the prophet laid it out he said
[48:02] there's pressure here pressure there he
[48:04] said right here Christians ref they feel
[48:07] it and all of us act out he said we get
[48:09] under pressure he says it's
[48:11] everywhere but there's a place where we
[48:14] can let off the
[48:16] pressure doesn't mean we're not going to
[48:18] feel it we'll feel it but there's a
[48:20] place where we can go to am and this is
[48:23] where when I think of this with the
[48:25] weariness of where that job was at there
[48:28] was an there was a a immovable desire
[48:32] that was unable to be moved and I want
[48:34] you to catch that and this is what I
[48:35] want you to lock on that desire that was
[48:38] unmovable is that very type in the life
[48:42] of a Believer when they have been sealed
[48:45] by the Holy Spirit there is a desire for
[48:49] the Living God that pulsates above
[48:53] everything it's a desire that even when
[48:56] I don't
[48:57] understand what's taking place but my
[48:59] love for him I can be disappointed in
[49:03] myself I have been and no doubt if God
[49:05] carries I will
[49:07] be but I've never been disappointed in
[49:11] God I might not certain directions that
[49:14] are taken it may not make any sense to
[49:17] me whatsoever there's been many things
[49:19] the way God has taken the course of many
[49:21] things that I would have never ever
[49:24] looked at it in that way or thought that
[49:26] Avenue was going to be taken but you
[49:28] know what God was do working on one
[49:31] person and maybe working on others but
[49:33] God was letting Samuel know I'm the one
[49:35] who's leading and I'm going to make it
[49:38] known that it's me and me alone that
[49:41] this is not something that you have
[49:42] figured out some bridge that you have
[49:45] crossed but I'm the one that's leading
[49:47] and in order for me to do that you've
[49:48] got to trust me
[49:51] completely don't lean on the arm of
[49:54] Flesh don't lean on Pharaoh's chariots
[49:56] let me bring Pharaoh's chariots our
[49:58] reasoning our imaginations the ways that
[50:01] we've always gone I don't want to lean
[50:03] on the arm of Flesh I want to lean on
[50:05] that Everlasting
[50:09] arm here was
[50:11] Elijah a man used a great man that had
[50:15] been used of God As a matter of fact God
[50:17] would use that Spirit five times in the
[50:21] scripture and here was Elijah after a a
[50:24] momentous day that had taken place on
[50:28] Mount Carmel everything that Elijah had
[50:31] done he had the Bible said according to
[50:34] Thy word oh Lord even the timing and
[50:37] waiting and after everything had taken
[50:40] place on Mount Carmel God had shown up
[50:43] in a mighty way it had been such a such
[50:47] a wonderful moment the prophet called it
[50:49] like this a red letter day how many of
[50:53] you had red letter days I like red
[50:56] letter days I do I you know I'd say well
[50:58] brother Samy you ought to like the black
[50:59] ones as well just as much well look I
[51:02] you know I like I don't I like red
[51:03] letter days black letter days are
[51:05] necessary for red letter days to come
[51:08] but I really like red letter
[51:11] days but if every day was a red letter
[51:13] day I probably wouldn't appreciate him
[51:15] very
[51:16] much but you know it's after them red
[51:19] letter days is where Satan wants to try
[51:22] to come because you see what in order
[51:25] for something to become a red letter day
[51:27] it's where you have given yourself
[51:30] completely to God where God has spoke to
[51:34] our life you know God it's things that
[51:36] that we our lives God has dealt with us
[51:38] like Elijah said I've done all of this
[51:40] according to thaty word it's when God
[51:42] can completely get us under his control
[51:44] and you know how it is when you're
[51:46] waiting on an answer or you're praying
[51:48] and you're seeking after the Lord and
[51:50] all of those things when when for a
[51:52] believer that means more than anything I
[51:54] want his leading and and you're doing
[51:56] everything you're getting into the word
[51:58] you're praying and you know you're
[52:00] reading in the Bible you're you're
[52:02] staying in that place knowing that I
[52:04] need for God to lead me and speak me
[52:07] speak to me I I want to be sensitive so
[52:09] where just the slightest little nudge
[52:11] I'll catch it and then you know after
[52:14] that nudge has come when the leadership
[52:16] has come and then after the event has
[52:18] taken place then our physical bodies are
[52:22] the ones that
[52:24] experience where we've kept it in a
[52:26] place of waiting on the
[52:29] Supernatural are you with me let me just
[52:32] bring it down to you every one of us
[52:34] have been in a meeting you know here we
[52:36] when we have special meetings here you
[52:38] go to meetings you know elsewhere and
[52:40] it's a it's the reason it's called a
[52:41] special meeting is because it's special
[52:44] it's a time of of of coming together and
[52:47] a time of Revival it's a time of
[52:50] refreshment it's intended to be that way
[52:53] it's a time for our faith to be built
[52:55] and s to be rekindled God has it that
[52:59] way for a purpose but you'll notice that
[53:02] every time when you can come out of
[53:04] something like that my this is exactly
[53:07] where the enemy wants to hit right after
[53:09] that you know why because our physical
[53:14] body our mind and our
[53:18] spirit have been
[53:21] worn that's good
[53:24] point I know we experiened these things
[53:26] even just from
[53:28] daytoday life I know we experien these
[53:32] things but I want you to understand and
[53:34] looking at this here tonight may God
[53:37] help me to just get out of the way that
[53:40] just to be able to speak this this
[53:42] thought that he laid on my heart there
[53:45] and that is when Elijah come to this
[53:48] place he he runs when Jezebel says I'm
[53:51] going to kill you this is a man that had
[53:56] faith
[53:58] now let's just step back for a minute
[54:00] and you see now a man running behind
[54:02] bushes and running for his life and
[54:05] telling Gesa you stay here at BBA I'm
[54:08] going on this was a man that just said I
[54:11] just got to get
[54:14] along and what's he running from he's
[54:16] running from the thre the threat of
[54:19] Jezebel she said I'm going to kill you
[54:22] this is the man who has just seen the
[54:25] mighty hand of God hallelujah and you
[54:29] say how could he take off and run like
[54:32] that the prophet tells us in the seven
[54:34] seal he says what it is he said it's
[54:36] that when the supernatural comes in
[54:39] that's the mind of Christ that drops
[54:41] down Hallelujah but he said when that
[54:43] pulls back he said then Elijah in his
[54:46] natural way of thinking did not know how
[54:50] to think so he took off
[54:52] running now we can shame Elijah all we
[54:55] want
[54:56] but if there's a fire in your house
[54:59] guarantee you're going to run out if you
[55:01] don't something's wrong with
[55:03] you right if you know there's something
[55:06] bad wrong in a situation and you see
[55:09] something say hey something don't look
[55:11] right what's going on in this store or
[55:13] out in the parking lot you're foolish to
[55:15] walk on in there right is that right so
[55:18] we we have a certain part that's about
[55:21] us and Elijah he takes off running why
[55:24] why when he comes to such a place he's
[55:27] tired he's weary he's worn his nerves
[55:31] the prophet said are on
[55:34] edge he's been used of God and now he's
[55:38] in a place to where he's asking God like
[55:43] job just take my
[55:45] life I ain't no better than none of my
[55:49] fathers just take my life I want to I
[55:51] want to go on I want to just I I I don't
[55:54] want to I don't want to stay here he's
[55:56] he's feeling after such an event and his
[56:00] testimony is now this is what he
[56:02] believes to be the truth because let me
[56:04] say this Elijah in that service he did
[56:07] not see an altar
[56:08] filled he did not see he saw the miracle
[56:11] of the fire come down but he did not see
[56:15] anything as far as out of the rest of
[56:18] the people yes there were those who
[56:20] would take that that direction to take
[56:22] these prophets of B and slay them but
[56:25] yet he did not see anything that would
[56:28] make him think that he wasn't the only
[56:32] one but his statement to God when God
[56:35] asks what are you doing
[56:40] here he said because he goes into this
[56:43] I'm jealous for the Lord I've done this
[56:47] and this is what they've done they've
[56:49] thrown down thy altars and all of this
[56:51] rebellion and all that's been done well
[56:53] God knew all of that that's why God sent
[56:55] him with a message was to call them out
[56:57] of
[56:58] that are you hearing me God sent the
[57:00] message not to not to just not to bring
[57:03] judgment on them but to call out of
[57:06] those things where they were halted
[57:08] between two opinions God sent a message
[57:11] with a certain sound to bring a courage
[57:16] Hallelujah for hearts to stand out but
[57:18] he didn't see the 7,000 but God saw the
[57:22] 7,000 what he thought was reality I'm
[57:25] the only one I'm the only one I I won't
[57:28] ask you but it's not fun to feel like
[57:31] you're all
[57:32] alone sometimes you're in the midst of a
[57:35] trial or a test or a situation and
[57:38] sometimes you can look and you can look
[57:39] around it seems like everybody else is
[57:41] Happy everybody else is full of joy and
[57:44] you feel all
[57:46] alone let me just tell you something
[57:49] you're not
[57:52] alone your feelings yes there are
[57:55] feelings that are there but God has a
[57:58] way of coming down and framing reality
[58:01] for what it really
[58:05] is he tells he tells Elijah I've got
[58:10] 7,000 that haven't bowed a knee to Bell
[58:13] hallu I've got 7,000 I I you didn't see
[58:16] them but what you became a channel you
[58:19] surrendered yourself to me and you
[58:22] became a channel and the fire of God
[58:24] came down through the word you don't see
[58:26] them but let me tell you something what
[58:28] was able to be achieved there has put a
[58:31] courage in their heart and they're
[58:33] standing for the
[58:36] truth he was encouraged but yet God had
[58:40] a way of ministering to the needs within
[58:43] his body he was you know John was the
[58:46] same way how many know this is you know
[58:48] here you have that same characteristic
[58:50] Same Spirit of Elijah John when he got
[58:55] into that prison
[58:57] he got his eye filmed over but I want
[58:59] you to catch his Eagle Eye he was still
[59:02] an eagle though your eye might get
[59:05] filmed over you're still an
[59:08] eagle there's a place that can bring you
[59:11] back to the vision and the sight that
[59:13] you once
[59:15] had and here when the Lord Jesus when he
[59:18] heard of what John had asked he never
[59:21] shamed John in the presence of his
[59:23] disciples because why he had sent John
[59:27] with that message the almighty God had
[59:30] sent John with that message to introduce
[59:33] them to the Messiah then a way would be
[59:36] made so he'd let him know this is what's
[59:38] needed show John what you have
[59:41] seen take it back to him and they
[59:45] communicated that to John and John that
[59:48] broke the film on John's
[59:51] eye you know where that film was at on
[59:54] his eye John thought things ought to be
[59:56] going
[59:58] differently out of the message forsaking
[1:00:00] all brother Brown takes that beatitude
[1:00:02] blessed are blessed is he that's not
[1:00:04] offended in me he said John was offended
[1:00:07] because he didn't see things happening
[1:00:09] the way he thought they ought to
[1:00:12] happen sometimes we can sit in the
[1:00:14] service and we can say well I think it
[1:00:16] ought to be this way or I think it ought
[1:00:18] to be this way and we miss what God is
[1:00:21] wanting to do for us individually am we
[1:00:25] can get we get and you see that's a trap
[1:00:27] of the enemy our minds if we we're not
[1:00:30] careful when we come in here and listen
[1:00:33] we don't want our minds let loose we
[1:00:35] want to be focused and say Lord I want
[1:00:37] to be zeroed in upon what it is that you
[1:00:40] want to say to me Lord I want to be
[1:00:41] attended because when we come into this
[1:00:44] place it's a very peaceful place but let
[1:00:46] me remind you all the way through the
[1:00:48] scriptures even when God had called
[1:00:51] together the summons there and the sons
[1:00:53] of God were summoned remember Satan came
[1:00:57] in that congregation as
[1:00:59] well Satan is permitted to come evil
[1:01:03] spirits are committed to are permitted
[1:01:05] to come evil spirits are not out there
[1:01:07] they're in here to try to detract our
[1:01:09] minds that's what we've been ministering
[1:01:11] on with the greatest battle ever fought
[1:01:13] the prophet tells us even a little girl
[1:01:16] that's suffering with sickness he said
[1:01:18] Satan is trying to battle at your mind
[1:01:21] to keep your mind off the word of
[1:01:24] God he'll battle at your
[1:01:27] mind but we've come here with this
[1:01:30] sayith the
[1:01:31] Lord we've come here and gathered
[1:01:34] together as Believers this is not a time
[1:01:37] of rest it's a time of battle it's a
[1:01:39] time of War we got to fight to keep my
[1:01:42] mind right fight to keep my thoughts
[1:01:47] right oh my and God knows how to bring
[1:01:51] refreshment and strength to our
[1:01:54] minds he doesn't he didn't shame Elijah
[1:01:59] for getting and feeling the way that he
[1:02:01] needed to feel he didn't he didn't shame
[1:02:04] him so how could you feel this way look
[1:02:07] what You' done he didn't shame him he
[1:02:10] knew he was tired he needed a rest you
[1:02:13] know what God has a special
[1:02:17] ICU for those who need a real rest
[1:02:20] treatment God knows when we get
[1:02:24] overworked listen friend
[1:02:26] we're living in a day and age that as
[1:02:28] far as punches Satan punches
[1:02:32] constantly we're living in a time where
[1:02:35] you're in the battlefield and the
[1:02:36] battleground of the mind it's
[1:02:39] constant but I want to remember he took
[1:02:42] the crown of thorns for your mind
[1:02:46] battles Satan is always there to try to
[1:02:49] contest everything in every move of God
[1:02:52] but this is where with the scripture
[1:02:54] that Paul would write of how that be
[1:02:57] that for we want not to swow to our
[1:02:59] flesh cuz we'll reap that but we want to
[1:03:01] swow to the spirit we shall reap that of
[1:03:04] the spirit and notice that even within
[1:03:07] that in Galatians 6:9 Paul would write
[1:03:10] let us not be weary in well doing for in
[1:03:13] due season we shall reap if we faint
[1:03:17] not now in another place in the
[1:03:19] scripture that I don't have up here Paul
[1:03:21] writes of this same portion of being not
[1:03:24] weary and well-doing and he's dealing
[1:03:26] with how that the church in thessalonica
[1:03:28] is to stand against people who are busy
[1:03:31] bodies instead of them working and
[1:03:33] beginning making a living so they can
[1:03:35] eat they're just mattering in
[1:03:37] everybody's
[1:03:38] Affairs and Paul's talking of how to
[1:03:40] keep that in check and the Very the
[1:03:42] statement he leads after this is be not
[1:03:44] weary and well-doing why because to
[1:03:47] standon listen to me now to stand for
[1:03:49] what's right and to stand for what's
[1:03:51] truth even though there's something
[1:03:53] within you that is standing standing in
[1:03:56] the midst of it but to stand right there
[1:03:58] and to yield your lives to yield your
[1:04:00] mortal bodies it depletes the very
[1:04:03] strength out of our bodies and out of
[1:04:06] our minds that is so
[1:04:08] true probably every one of us in here
[1:04:12] managers casew workers people who are
[1:04:16] supervisors parents maybe can look and
[1:04:21] say I'm tired of repeating myself I've
[1:04:24] told those guys that five times
[1:04:26] times every month the beginning of the
[1:04:29] month I have to say it I've had to say
[1:04:31] this over and over and finally you just
[1:04:35] say why you get weary at even standing
[1:04:39] for what's right doesn't mean you're a
[1:04:42] compromiser righten some of you smiling
[1:04:45] I know we pick plucking chords now it's
[1:04:48] true mom mom get tired of you know
[1:04:51] telling here uh you know kids to do this
[1:04:53] and do this and you know do this and do
[1:04:55] that and finally you know it just it
[1:04:57] gets to a time you can you go for so
[1:04:59] long and then through the cares and
[1:05:01] toils and pressures of life you get
[1:05:04] weary now listen when my soul my soul
[1:05:08] has never been wearied your Soul's never
[1:05:12] been weary but my spirit has been
[1:05:14] wearied my body has been
[1:05:18] wearied I'm not just talking about when
[1:05:20] we've been sick we felt that when we've
[1:05:22] been sick but even sometimes just the we
[1:05:26] in our minds and our spirits but I want
[1:05:29] to tell you you're not
[1:05:32] alone thank you I want you to think of
[1:05:35] this message I'm going to start right
[1:05:36] here the message perfect Faith
[1:05:41] right right and the prophet goes in to
[1:05:43] talk about his own life a little bit
[1:05:46] right he says I get spells
[1:05:49] too I get
[1:05:51] moody I get to a spot he said what gets
[1:05:54] me is when where I get to those spells
[1:05:57] when I get
[1:05:58] all
[1:06:00] overworked and Satan comes telling me
[1:06:04] nobody cares for you you really haven't
[1:06:07] got a friend in the world now notice
[1:06:10] what gets me is when I get all
[1:06:13] overworked he's talking about this body
[1:06:17] and in his Spirit not talking about his
[1:06:20] soul but what gets me when I get overw
[1:06:23] work then Satan you know you see Satan
[1:06:25] is an
[1:06:26] opportunist he's a buzzard he's a
[1:06:31] vulture he's an opportunist that
[1:06:33] anywhere he can find a place to sleep to
[1:06:37] slip in listen when did he come and
[1:06:40] tempt the Lord Jesus not when he was at
[1:06:43] his
[1:06:44] strongest
[1:06:46] weakest 40 days of fasting come on just
[1:06:49] came right out of a red letter day the
[1:06:53] heaven had open Dove descended down this
[1:06:56] is my beloved Son in whom I'm well
[1:06:58] pleased led up into the Wilderness to be
[1:07:00] tempted of the devil but it wasn't until
[1:07:03] after 40 days when he was at his weakest
[1:07:06] moment amen true and then Satan said get
[1:07:10] the Bell please I'm ready to
[1:07:14] go but the Lord Jesus showed you and I
[1:07:18] listen he did this for you and I so that
[1:07:21] he might be a faithful and merciful high
[1:07:24] priest not just somebody who knows it
[1:07:26] but has experienced it when we are at
[1:07:29] our Wit's End when our weariness and the
[1:07:32] tiredness of our body through the
[1:07:34] perplexities of life but yet a Believer
[1:07:37] is a Believer at all
[1:07:40] times and the weakest of Christians the
[1:07:43] weakest of Christians is still more than
[1:07:47] enough and match for the enemy because
[1:07:51] we're not standing on our own we're
[1:07:54] standing on his word we may not even
[1:07:56] have the strength to frame the words
[1:07:59] exactly or muster them out but there is
[1:08:02] a voice behind our voice and Satan must
[1:08:06] respect that because that voice is the
[1:08:09] voice of the blood it's the voice of the
[1:08:12] word it's the voice of Jesus
[1:08:15] [Applause]
[1:08:16] [Music]
[1:08:22] Christ brother Rand when does he when
[1:08:24] does Satan seem like he's coming at when
[1:08:26] I get
[1:08:32] overworked remember I love this remember
[1:08:36] same quote I'm not immune to to to the
[1:08:40] Temptation I got to overcome
[1:08:45] that it a that ain't going to ever come
[1:08:47] overcoming don't mean that you don't
[1:08:49] have to over that well once I've
[1:08:51] overcome it it'll never come again no
[1:08:52] Satan he just he continued to come but
[1:08:54] you've got to overcome it you see that's
[1:08:57] real overcoming too you might say well
[1:09:00] I'll tell you what I I I'll be out there
[1:09:02] to walk walk on the water listen it's
[1:09:04] real overcoming in your life as a
[1:09:06] Believer to walk above those Temptations
[1:09:10] right and say I I know in whom I have
[1:09:13] believed and I'm persuaded He's Able
[1:09:15] notice I got to overcome that then when
[1:09:17] I look back and I see something like
[1:09:20] this what is he talking about where
[1:09:22] Satan has said you don't got a friend in
[1:09:23] the world and he brother B is just said
[1:09:25] in the beginning that quote I see many
[1:09:27] of you that's traveled a long distance
[1:09:28] you stayed over for the Sunday night
[1:09:30] service and he's he's just talking about
[1:09:32] that and now when Satan has said you
[1:09:33] don't got a friend in the world watch
[1:09:35] what the prophet does he said when I
[1:09:37] look back and see something like this I
[1:09:40] put it right back in his face and I say
[1:09:43] what about that no don't run in the
[1:09:45] corner what about that come back here
[1:09:50] unpack your tail from between your legs
[1:09:52] I want you to look at this
[1:09:57] somebody sends you a text that says I'm
[1:09:59] praying for you you call that devil out
[1:10:01] of the corner and say what about this
[1:10:04] devil nobody loves me nobody cares about
[1:10:07] me no no don't you run away what about
[1:10:13] this what are you doing framing
[1:10:20] reality here's the Lord Jesus in the
[1:10:22] back of the boat What a Mighty service
[1:10:24] they've just had
[1:10:26] Miracles that's been done many that were
[1:10:28] healed of unclean spirits my red letter
[1:10:32] day but here he is laying in the back of
[1:10:34] the boat the prophet says in Rising
[1:10:36] gyrus his daughter he said how the devil
[1:10:39] of the sea sworn they drowned him while
[1:10:41] he was laying back there tired he said
[1:10:43] you know the devil takes advantage of
[1:10:45] you when you get tired or worn out he
[1:10:48] does you the same way you just get a
[1:10:50] little tired and wore out and get
[1:10:52] discouraged he caught Jesus right at
[1:10:54] that weak spot got tired and weary he
[1:10:57] was laying back in the back of the boat
[1:10:59] rocking around and the disciples came
[1:11:04] don't you care that we
[1:11:07] perish I don't know about you but
[1:11:10] sometimes there's things that where I
[1:11:12] know brothers and ministers they they'll
[1:11:14] get ready and they'll take a nap before
[1:11:16] they preach I I can't do that personally
[1:11:18] because sometimes those little things of
[1:11:20] naps I feel like probably some of you
[1:11:22] can relate to me those naps you can cut
[1:11:25] out of and I feel like I got swimmy head
[1:11:28] I feel like I can't even get thing my
[1:11:29] thoughts together it's like one of those
[1:11:32] times you don't feel like you could even
[1:11:33] talk at the dinner table now that's just
[1:11:35] me that may not be you that that's fine
[1:11:37] that ain't nothing spiritual that's just
[1:11:39] something I know about me right but I
[1:11:41] wonder when you and I have been tired
[1:11:43] and somebody comes to wake us and here's
[1:11:46] a serious matter sometimes it's a little
[1:11:48] hard to get
[1:11:49] awake right especially when his body
[1:11:53] remember God came down and became one of
[1:11:55] of us and so experienced what it was
[1:11:59] when the supernatural moving in this
[1:12:02] veil of
[1:12:03] humanity he experienced what it was like
[1:12:07] remember how brother Bram would tell us
[1:12:08] over and over through the message deep
[1:12:09] called to the Deep he would tell us even
[1:12:11] on that what you see there in Washington
[1:12:13] DC and he would tell us oh considering
[1:12:16] of how he said even Daniel and different
[1:12:18] ones he said when they would experience
[1:12:20] visions and how that Daniel said he was
[1:12:22] troubled in his head many days
[1:12:24] afterwards
[1:12:25] right because of the impact of how the
[1:12:28] Supernatural and what has moved down
[1:12:30] upon upon their life and then even
[1:12:32] considering the Lord Jesus where he
[1:12:34] would get tired and he would get worried
[1:12:36] and brother Bram said and he was the
[1:12:38] Virgin born son of God made in the
[1:12:40] likeness of sinful flesh like us but he
[1:12:42] experienced that weariness and that
[1:12:45] tiredness in his body now there's ways
[1:12:48] of how that the enemy when he will come
[1:12:51] you know I find over and over in the
[1:12:53] things when I go through and I study
[1:12:55] you'll find that when brother Bram will
[1:12:57] talk about nervous conditions and
[1:12:58] nervous things you'll talk about even
[1:13:01] sometimes of our sisters going through
[1:13:02] certain things and over and over you
[1:13:04] find a lot of times in the discernments
[1:13:06] of things of how that the enemy will
[1:13:08] attack during the evening time the
[1:13:10] prophet said I see you he said oh he
[1:13:12] says you get that weary feeling you get
[1:13:15] really weary in the evening time you get
[1:13:18] really tired around that time and he
[1:13:22] talking about a nervous condition that
[1:13:24] you know that what in order to kind of
[1:13:26] deal with that and maybe the season of
[1:13:28] life that they're in but what I'm saying
[1:13:30] is that how Satan will so attack in
[1:13:33] certain times why why wouldn't Satan let
[1:13:35] me ask you this why wouldn't Satan
[1:13:37] attack in the morning
[1:13:39] time you're
[1:13:41] rested right he giveth his beloved sleep
[1:13:44] for night owls he giveth his beloved
[1:13:47] sleep right now notice well but but the
[1:13:50] whole point is this is the rest and
[1:13:52] refreshment Even in our body
[1:13:56] but how Satan would come and he'll plan
[1:13:58] his attack for that weakest moment let
[1:14:01] me tell you something you and I both
[1:14:03] know there's times and situations that
[1:14:05] you and I don't have control over of
[1:14:07] where we're standing in certain times
[1:14:08] and situations and we know sometimes
[1:14:11] when maybe that our threads are a little
[1:14:13] bit thin that's a time that we need to
[1:14:15] say Lord I need more help now than I
[1:14:18] ever have Lord my threads are so thin I
[1:14:20] I I don't want the wrong character
[1:14:22] anything to be expressed Lord I want
[1:14:25] that of you Lord God breath me the
[1:14:27] coating on the threads give me the
[1:14:30] strength and fortitude I need to make it
[1:14:32] through this meeting through this moment
[1:14:34] through this interaction God give me
[1:14:36] what I
[1:14:39] need now notice how Satan will attack
[1:14:42] it's amazing how that he'll come and you
[1:14:44] know he'll work on certain ways like
[1:14:47] what he did with Elijah he told Elijah
[1:14:49] you're the only one he made him feel all
[1:14:51] alone after a great event had taken
[1:14:53] place and he's tired and his weary Satan
[1:14:55] can come with in so many different ways
[1:14:58] and tell us so many different things and
[1:15:00] you know what it can seem very real let
[1:15:02] me tell you what Elijah was experiencing
[1:15:04] he would have argued you face to face
[1:15:06] because he stood in the face of God and
[1:15:07] said I'm the only
[1:15:10] one now did anybody tell Elijah hey hey
[1:15:13] hey hey hey hey before you go in that
[1:15:14] cave I want you to know you're the only
[1:15:17] one he couldn't say that right but in
[1:15:21] his mind right that's what he thought
[1:15:25] and what he thought affected his
[1:15:29] actions so Satan knows just how to plant
[1:15:33] in your mind he knows how just all of a
[1:15:35] sudden he can plant a little seed plant
[1:15:38] a little doubt even while the word is
[1:15:40] coming forth he can want to try to plant
[1:15:42] a little seed of Doubt get you doubting
[1:15:45] and thinking and get you focusing in
[1:15:47] upon yourself why because God is
[1:15:49] ministering a word that would be fitting
[1:15:52] to our lives but he wants to distract us
[1:15:55] from what we need to be focusing on and
[1:15:58] he can get us so much there's times he
[1:16:00] could get us so far in the corner that
[1:16:02] we almost feel like I I don't know
[1:16:04] what's a use of even being here I tell
[1:16:06] you I how you feel so isolated you see
[1:16:09] any thought that ever comes from the
[1:16:11] enemy right is an isolating thought but
[1:16:16] what comes from God will always draw you
[1:16:18] in to the word see I want scripture for
[1:16:21] that when the spirit of Truth has come
[1:16:23] he will lead and guide you into all
[1:16:26] truth Jesus said come unto me all ye
[1:16:29] that are heavy laden and I will give you
[1:16:31] rest the word of God the spirit of God
[1:16:34] draws you unto himself he reconciles us
[1:16:37] unto himself not excludes
[1:16:41] us not trying to exclude and get us over
[1:16:43] in a corner and then just start way
[1:16:45] laying on us so if you don't mind
[1:16:47] tonight I'd like to take a few moments
[1:16:49] and just whay on the
[1:16:51] devil in the message or the private
[1:16:54] interview was Sister Bruce and I think
[1:16:57] I've told you this as a church over the
[1:16:58] years this message when your private
[1:17:01] interview it's right before he preaches
[1:17:02] the Masterpiece this particular
[1:17:05] interview was not what sister Bruce
[1:17:07] called brother brandham called it
[1:17:10] because sister Bruce was one who had
[1:17:11] such an instrument brother brma actually
[1:17:13] when he's talking and praying for her
[1:17:16] he's saying I don't they said I've
[1:17:18] prayed and asked God not to take you cuz
[1:17:19] you're such a value to this church he
[1:17:23] repairs her life to like that of dorcus
[1:17:25] of old in the in the in the book of Acts
[1:17:28] and remember and here it was with sister
[1:17:30] Bruce she was actually the one going
[1:17:32] around to different ones and saying I
[1:17:35] wish I had what you had oh I wish I had
[1:17:37] what you had now she had I'll tell you
[1:17:39] the way sister Bruce was used and you
[1:17:41] know some insights of these testimonies
[1:17:43] that had been shared with me over the
[1:17:45] years it was actually a brother after I
[1:17:47] preached some certain things that
[1:17:48] actually got up before the congregation
[1:17:50] and told him afterwards do you realize
[1:17:51] who called this interview it wasn't
[1:17:53] brother brandom it was Sister it wasn't
[1:17:55] sister Bruce it was brother brandham
[1:17:57] brother brandham heard that she was
[1:17:58] going around saying that and so he
[1:18:00] called the interview I'm glad the word
[1:18:01] knows when to call an interview aren't
[1:18:04] you aren't you glad when our thoughts or
[1:18:06] our doubts or anything can be a certain
[1:18:08] way and the word just shows up and
[1:18:09] you're like how did he know that well
[1:18:12] well not a man knew that but God knew
[1:18:14] that and God called an
[1:18:16] interview and so sister Bruce you know
[1:18:19] she's seen so many miracles praying for
[1:18:21] people in the hospitals and people being
[1:18:23] healed and getting up God used her in a
[1:18:24] Wonder ful way but here she is still
[1:18:26] she's standing in this place and she
[1:18:28] says sister Georgie Bruce says brother
[1:18:30] brandom most of all I want the
[1:18:32] experience that I've been sealed in the
[1:18:35] Holy Ghost and if God will reveal it to
[1:18:37] your heart well it wasn't so important
[1:18:40] that it was revealed to brother bram's
[1:18:42] heart it's important that it's revealed
[1:18:44] to her heart you know even after what
[1:18:47] God does in your life it's got to be
[1:18:48] revealed to you what he's already done
[1:18:51] and you know what you can't you got to
[1:18:52] look at the right kind of evidence
[1:18:56] you got to look at the right evidence
[1:18:57] the word
[1:19:00] evidence oh he says I believe with all
[1:19:03] my heart you're a real Born Again
[1:19:04] believer sister Bruce how could that
[1:19:06] Spirit just leave now watch this when
[1:19:09] you get sick you get weary and you're a
[1:19:14] nervous type person she says yes and you
[1:19:18] keep getting things on your mind little
[1:19:21] bitty things and it just keeps building
[1:19:24] up both both ways right it's like you go
[1:19:27] to the flea market buy a little bit buy
[1:19:29] a little bit more buy a little bit more
[1:19:32] buy a little bit more no sister Elia
[1:19:33] don't don't you spend a loud Amen on
[1:19:35] this one buy a little bit more buy a
[1:19:36] little bit more and for you know it the
[1:19:41] garage now listen to me stay with go
[1:19:43] back with me on this right here it
[1:19:46] starts brother Aron with just little
[1:19:48] bitty things he just say a little bitty
[1:19:51] little bitty and eventually little bitty
[1:19:53] things add up
[1:19:55] adds
[1:19:57] up notice you get somebody watch watch
[1:20:00] how watch how she's made up now you get
[1:20:02] somebody on your heart you want to pray
[1:20:04] for him you get up and you'll pray for
[1:20:06] him you can't rest till you get that
[1:20:08] person prayed for that's you then take
[1:20:11] on the other side Satan maybe will
[1:20:14] present something and out this way and
[1:20:16] you're a nature and God works and Satan
[1:20:19] works then when Satan tries to make you
[1:20:22] believe that you are not you you keep
[1:20:25] building this and maybe this and this
[1:20:28] don't look at yourself yes
[1:20:33] sir that's a word from a Vindicated
[1:20:36] Prophet yes sir they might as well say
[1:20:38] private interview with Samuel browny
[1:20:41] private interview put your name on there
[1:20:43] private
[1:20:45] interview notice how she's made up
[1:20:48] notice the word is not going to come and
[1:20:50] just change how she's natured her
[1:20:54] temperament
[1:20:55] God's made her that way for a reason
[1:20:58] sometimes we we we we in our lives oh I
[1:21:01] I don't want to be this way I want to be
[1:21:03] that way I want to be oh I wish I could
[1:21:05] be like so and so we'll never be like so
[1:21:07] and so God don't want us like so and so
[1:21:09] he don't have two thumb prints that are
[1:21:11] exactly alike you say what is it that
[1:21:14] God's wanting he's wanting us to realize
[1:21:17] our humanity and our need for him to be
[1:21:20] in full control in our
[1:21:23] life David said I'm fearfully and
[1:21:25] wonderfully made and the prophet is
[1:21:27] going down through here the word is
[1:21:29] Discerning and letting her know this is
[1:21:32] how you're made up now as a daughter of
[1:21:34] God right this is how you take
[1:21:38] Dominion God puts people on your heart
[1:21:40] and it builds and builds till finally
[1:21:42] you said I'm going to the hospital to
[1:21:43] pray for him and he says now Satan sees
[1:21:46] how you're natured and he'll put
[1:21:48] something and keep putting something
[1:21:49] putting something and fin you're like
[1:21:52] I'm not even I'm not even sealed
[1:21:55] I'm I'm not even a believer I don't got
[1:21:56] the same experience that everybody else
[1:21:57] has I don't have this now you see what
[1:21:59] she's looking at she's looking in that
[1:22:02] time frame of other things that she's
[1:22:04] seeing and wanting and evidence that
[1:22:08] she's had an
[1:22:09] experience and the prophet La down in
[1:22:12] this interview takes her into a place
[1:22:14] this is normally how you would be you
[1:22:16] would love to do this cut your hair and
[1:22:18] do all these other things he said but
[1:22:20] you was like that but something changed
[1:22:21] what what was it that changed those
[1:22:23] desires she said Christ that that's your
[1:22:26] answer that's your answer right there
[1:22:29] see she had the answer the whole time it
[1:22:32] just was revealed in the presence of the
[1:22:34] word of
[1:22:35] God hallelujah so even how we're natured
[1:22:39] in a certain way brother B will pick
[1:22:40] this up in other places in the message
[1:22:43] of how that we can be natured a certain
[1:22:45] way and how that he says here we can
[1:22:47] have this depending on how a person is
[1:22:49] natured they can actually get something
[1:22:51] on their heart from the inside
[1:22:53] conscience that is actually been reborn
[1:22:55] by the spirit of God and know that it's
[1:22:57] absolutely scriptural it's what God
[1:22:59] wants me to do and he says on the
[1:23:01] outside conscience how they're made up
[1:23:03] the B the star they're born under the
[1:23:04] birth path he said Satan will come and
[1:23:06] stand on that outer conscience and begin
[1:23:08] to pound at them and pound at him and
[1:23:11] pound at him and try to get him away
[1:23:13] from that and he said what a times many
[1:23:15] times he said we give heed to that on
[1:23:17] the outer
[1:23:19] conscience let me just tell you this
[1:23:21] right here I don't know how many times
[1:23:22] that the enemy has wanted to sweep
[1:23:24] around on me and say you know what you
[1:23:26] need to you need Don't Preach this you
[1:23:28] you oh the people aren't going to get
[1:23:29] that oh you know what he'll come over
[1:23:31] here on the other oh that's so simple
[1:23:33] that's so shallow you don't need you say
[1:23:35] brother Samuel oh that that must all
[1:23:37] that must be so easy well I know who's
[1:23:39] talking to me but you know sometimes
[1:23:42] it's almost like you've got a you're
[1:23:44] waiting you're listening because
[1:23:45] constantly I'm looking for God what is
[1:23:48] your mind you know you've experienced it
[1:23:51] right here we're walking right out of
[1:23:53] that offense minutes before I walk out
[1:23:55] there's times where God will change
[1:23:57] things on
[1:23:58] me why he does it that way I don't know
[1:24:01] maybe it's because just to teach me and
[1:24:04] let me to see that he that my dependence
[1:24:06] is upon him doesn't mean that I won't
[1:24:08] come around and preach these other
[1:24:10] things in their season and their
[1:24:13] time but the battles that we have to go
[1:24:15] through you have to go through that's
[1:24:18] right I mean why you going to church

[1:24:37] when a person you know he goes to talk
[1:24:39] about evidences and he says it in
[1:24:41] question and answers part three he says
[1:24:43] I don't care how much you spoke in
[1:24:45] tongues how much you jumped and how much
[1:24:47] you did this or that or the other
[1:24:49] whatever you've done it wouldn't me a
[1:24:51] thing if the Holy Spirit wasn't in there
[1:24:53] to condemn you on the things that's
[1:24:55] right and wrong aren't you glad there's
[1:24:58] something on the inside that says uh-uh
[1:25:00] that ain't right you can try to override
[1:25:02] that but let me you cannot shake that
[1:25:05] uncomfortable feeling why it's the
[1:25:07] spirit of God that's bringing conviction

[1:26:57] desperation preached the evening after
[1:27:00] he preached the token message in
[1:27:02] Jeffersonville that morning and spoke
[1:27:05] about the assurance that has come Among
[1:27:07] Us the token the necessity to have the
[1:27:09] token how God has so laid that burden on
[1:27:11] his heart that we must have that token
[1:27:15] for Rapture showing that the blood's
[1:27:18] been applied we can't even get on the
[1:27:20] highway unless we've got the token like
[1:27:22] I mean you couldn't even make it into
[1:27:23] secure security you could get into the
[1:27:25] security line at the airport but you're
[1:27:27] not going to get in and through that
[1:27:30] line without a
[1:27:32] ticket you got to have a ticket and when
[1:27:35] you got a ticket then you can pass
[1:27:37] through security that ticket will tell
[1:27:39] you your gate of departure right and
[1:27:42] that's what the token is that's what the
[1:27:44] Holy Ghost is it's your assurance I've
[1:27:47] got a spot reserved on that flight
[1:27:49] that's
[1:27:50] [Applause]
[1:27:51] right my place is reserved on that
[1:27:55] flight glory be to God now notice this
[1:27:59] when brother B has just brought the
[1:28:00] Assurance of this and he speaks to the
[1:28:03] people in the beginning of desperation
[1:28:05] just a little bit of counsel and he's
[1:28:07] talking with them of the assurance that
[1:28:09] has been brought our way by that token
[1:28:12] and what that means to have it applied
[1:28:14] that you have been accepted when the
[1:28:16] Holy Ghost has come upon you it shows
[1:28:18] you've been accepted and then he says
[1:28:21] this very statement in paragraph 18 of
[1:28:23] desper ation now he says Now not no
[1:28:26] certain evidence you say brother brandom
[1:28:28] he said I feel it in your
[1:28:31] minds why will I know or How Will I Know

[1:29:22] God come on back here devil I got one
[1:29:24] more I got a lot more but I got one more
[1:29:27] after preaching it is the rising of the
[1:29:29] Sun that morning the prophet starts out
[1:29:33] does God change his mind about his word
[1:29:36] and he begins to just encourage the
[1:29:39] people about that message it is the
[1:29:41] rising of the sun I tell you
[1:29:43] what it was like one brother was we were
[1:29:45] talking and fellowshipping you know
[1:29:47] together and he was talking about where
[1:29:48] he had been over there and overseas
[1:29:50] ministering and and he began to quote
[1:29:52] the message of the rising of the sun he
[1:29:53] finally stopped in the middle of the
[1:29:55] quoting and he said look he just asked
[1:29:57] the brother he said don't interpret this
[1:29:58] have you ever listened to his the rising
[1:29:59] of the sun
[1:30:01] no well how in the world can you
[1:30:03] interpret for
[1:30:05] me you see what I'm saying that's a
[1:30:08] that's a key message it is the rising of
[1:30:10] the sun that's what it's a key message
[1:30:15] it's a message where the picture gets
[1:30:17] turned
[1:30:18] right Hallelujah I'm not just talking
[1:30:21] about that of that that cloud in Sabino
[1:30:24] that's one way where the Prophet said we
[1:30:26] got to turn it the right way but God
[1:30:28] turned the picture in you and me he
[1:30:30] turned it the right way so that you and
[1:30:32] I can see I was always a son and
[1:30:34] daughter of
[1:30:37] God we weren't looking at it right we
[1:30:40] were looking at it like if I can just be
[1:30:41] worthy if I can just get good enough if
[1:30:44] I can just do the right thing and God
[1:30:46] takes the word and says hey you're
[1:30:48] looking at it the wrong way let me turn
[1:30:50] it to the right woo
[1:30:54] it was on the right he pardoned the
[1:30:58] thief hallelujah
[1:31:00] [Applause]
[1:31:01] [Music]
[1:31:03] hallelujah where did that weariness go
[1:31:06] hallu hallu where did that weariness
[1:31:10] [Laughter]
[1:31:12] go oh my here it is does God change his
[1:31:15] mind about his word he just preach it's
[1:31:18] a rising of the sun he said now look he
[1:31:19] said I apologize for that long message
[1:31:21] this morning I don't feel bad
[1:31:24] I didn't want to wear out your patience
[1:31:25] and then come at it again tonight but I
[1:31:27] wanted to get that message to you that
[1:31:29] you are a part of this resurrection and
[1:31:32] don't worry about it no more just
[1:31:36] Rejoice over it there is nothing nowhere
[1:31:41] can separate you from it nothing
[1:31:44] eternally secured in the kingdom of God
[1:31:47] when God has stamped his seal upon you
[1:31:50] you're to the end of the destination
[1:31:52] when the government puts a seal Upon A
[1:31:55] package the railroad puts a seal on the
[1:31:57] door and that car cannot be tampered
[1:31:59] with until it reaches its
[1:32:02] destination let me pause here for a
[1:32:04] moment the prophet says in an earlier
[1:32:06] message he said Satan can come and Buzz
[1:32:08] at that seal tease at that seal and want
[1:32:10] to just try to come at it but he cannot
[1:32:12] tamper with that
[1:32:15] [Applause]
[1:32:17] seal that is so good when God puts his
[1:32:22] seal upon a man and the seal is the holy
[1:32:25] spirit when he seals a man like that he
[1:32:28] is gone to his eternal destination never
[1:32:32] no more can he ever go back anymore cuz
[1:32:35] remember Ephesians 4:30 grieve not the
[1:32:37] holy spirit of God whereby you are
[1:32:39] sealed for all time see you're sealed
[1:32:41] forever you're sealed eternally into the
[1:32:43] kingdom of God by the Holy Spirit now
[1:32:45] think of
[1:32:50] that I got some shouting shoes on right
[1:32:53] now
[1:32:54] now watch the devil will punch at you
[1:33:00] and he'll say everything to you and
[1:33:03] accuse you and try to make you think
[1:33:07] that you're
[1:33:08] not let's read the last part together
[1:33:11] but don't you listen to him right if
[1:33:16] he's been a liar once he's still a
[1:33:19] liar a liar is a liar is a liar
[1:33:24] now you know watch how me now how do I
[1:33:26] come back with this now you know you've
[1:33:29] passed from Death unto life you know the
[1:33:31] things that you once loved you don't
[1:33:34] love no more you know that you have
[1:33:37] believed every hallelu word of
[1:33:47] God what a reality to be framed with sir
[1:33:51] Psalms 273 I think I think this is
[1:33:54] phenomenal of how that this would be the
[1:33:57] scriptures and I'm only going to use two
[1:33:58] of them out of here but what would be
[1:34:00] used for the text of the
[1:34:04] Rapture though a host verse three should
[1:34:07] encamp against
[1:34:08] meall my heart shall not
[1:34:14] fear Body Spirit all fearful things can
[1:34:17] come through there but my heart shall
[1:34:20] not fear praise God I know in whom I
[1:34:23] have believed
[1:34:25] amen I know that I've met God's
[1:34:28] requirements I know the Grace has been
[1:34:29] given I'm able to look and see what I
[1:34:31] was before and what I am
[1:34:33] after oh
[1:34:36] Hallelujah though War should arise
[1:34:39] against
[1:34:40] me in
[1:34:42] this will I be
[1:34:44] confident one thing have I desired of
[1:34:50] the Lord and that will I seek after that
[1:34:54] I may dwell in the house of the Lord all
[1:34:57] the days of my life to behold the beauty
[1:35:00] of the Lord and to inquire in his
[1:35:04] Temple this is where my confidence is in
[1:35:08] what the
[1:35:09] desire that's in my
[1:35:12] heart because the desire that's in my
[1:35:15] life tells me who's on the control tower
[1:35:19] of my soul that's a direct quote
[1:35:22] Hallelujah
[1:35:24] two different control Towers there's a
[1:35:25] control tower for the flesh sometimes
[1:35:28] you know you get to a place like right
[1:35:30] now my mouth is a little dry it could
[1:35:32] use a drink but I'm not going to take
[1:35:33] one right now the body is letting me
[1:35:35] know hey hey hey you need to get a drink
[1:35:37] need to get a drink need to get a drink
[1:35:39] right the body calls for certain things
[1:35:41] hey it's cold you need to get a blanket
[1:35:43] I know some people live in blankets but
[1:35:45] it's cold you need to get a blanket
[1:35:47] right your body sends you
[1:35:50] signals and the prophet takes that same
[1:35:52] thing and then he'll flip it right
[1:35:54] around and he says your soul is also
[1:35:57] calling for Spiritual
[1:35:59] things that's so good see the desire
[1:36:02] that rises up within us get into the
[1:36:05] word Lord I I want to get in your
[1:36:07] presence Lord I I want to I want to move
[1:36:09] deeper Lord with you a desire this is
[1:36:12] what David this is his confidence David
[1:36:14] notice his confidence isn't that I've
[1:36:15] hit every tea I've dotted every I've
[1:36:17] done all this no no neither is he
[1:36:21] calvinist but he's a balanced man man
[1:36:24] he's looking at the desire in his
[1:36:27] heart he's looking at the desire in his
[1:36:30] life God has change the desires of my
[1:36:33] life David what is it everything is
[1:36:35] surrounding you how in the world are you
[1:36:37] going to face that enemy and here's how
[1:36:40] this is my confidence one thing I've
[1:36:43] desired to dwell in the house of the
[1:36:45] Lord I want to be wherever he's at I
[1:36:49] want to behold the beauty in his Temple
[1:36:51] I want to see his face
[1:36:54] I want to Behold Him I don't care about
[1:36:56] anything else all of that has faded
[1:37:02] away you love
[1:37:04] him the worshippers once
[1:37:07] purged has no more
[1:37:10] desire of
[1:37:12] sin it's gone right aren't you thankful
[1:37:16] for the mercy of
[1:37:17] God hallelujah let's stand
[1:37:27] maybe as they play something softly let
[1:37:28] me read this quote to you 1954 questions
[1:37:31] and
[1:37:33] answers how many remember them three
[1:37:35] little monkeys yeah make sure I get it
[1:37:38] right hear no evil see no evil speak no
[1:37:43] evil brother brand refers to them in
[1:37:46] this quote and he's referring back to
[1:37:49] that and he says now
[1:37:50] see just keep your mind pure
[1:37:54] and on
[1:37:55] Christ that's a
[1:37:58] job because there's a lot of filthy
[1:38:00] thoughts can go through our minds
[1:38:02] there's a lot of Filth there's a lot of
[1:38:03] junk there's a lot of things can go
[1:38:04] through our minds is that
[1:38:07] right and Friends listen don't just
[1:38:09] classify filthy some other way there can
[1:38:10] be accusations can go through our minds
[1:38:12] against a brother or against a sister
[1:38:14] that's not Purity can right God never
[1:38:18] legislates an accusation against a
[1:38:20] brother or sister that's right into our
[1:38:22] mind
[1:38:23] one of the quick ways that we know where
[1:38:25] that come from is look how it begins to
[1:38:27] change and affect our
[1:38:30] attitude that's good watch this I'm
[1:38:34] talking about framing reality now just
[1:38:37] keep your mind pure and on
[1:38:40] Christ now he said if you don't watch
[1:38:43] you'll get yourself into a place if if
[1:38:45] you keep thinking on that I said don't
[1:38:47] think on it and what's he telling them
[1:38:49] not to think on you can't live so
[1:38:52] perfect till you don't make that mistake
[1:38:57] now
[1:38:59] wow so you mean if I'm thinking my
[1:39:03] thinking is I'm going to live in such a
[1:39:05] way I'll never make a mistake or never
[1:39:09] make a mistake
[1:39:10] again you're not living in
[1:39:13] reality but the holy spirit is trying to
[1:39:16] frame reality for us right he said you
[1:39:20] can't live so perfect till you don't
[1:39:22] make that mistake now don't you think
[1:39:25] you'll ever get that way cuz you won't
[1:39:29] you're not sinless and you're certainly
[1:39:32] will get off their track and on this and
[1:39:35] on that but a man that's once knocked
[1:39:38] down how many he's been knocked down
[1:39:41] before probably could raise both my
[1:39:42] hands and and feet as
[1:39:45] well if he's a real Soldier he'll rise
[1:39:48] up again Am Lord let me rise and try
[1:39:51] again what is that desire
[1:39:56] desire but a coward as soon as he sees
[1:39:58] he he makes his first little mistake
[1:40:01] like I said this morning the bug and the
[1:40:03] water spider they'll crawl right back
[1:40:05] out into the water again he just can't
[1:40:08] stand
[1:40:10] it see that's something where you can
[1:40:13] see this with job though job's thinking
[1:40:16] is
[1:40:17] wrong but what you find there's a desire
[1:40:20] in his heart that is unch
[1:40:25] changing he wants to get before God I
[1:40:27] want to talk to him I don't know what's
[1:40:30] taking place but I know if I can just
[1:40:31] get in his presence I'll understand his
[1:40:34] words I I'll know I I I don't I don't
[1:40:36] know what's going on but I know if I
[1:40:37] could just get there and I know he won't
[1:40:39] come against me with his power but if I
[1:40:42] can just get in his
[1:40:44] presence he'll put strength in
[1:40:48] me and job over and over many more
[1:40:51] scriptures I could have rehearsed right
[1:40:53] through for you to show that desire that
[1:40:56] job had that in the midst of even
[1:41:00] accusations his desire was to get before
[1:41:04] God he said I'll maintain my
[1:41:07] ways a hypocrite will not be ex but be
[1:41:10] accepted he said he shall be my
[1:41:12] salvation look at that that desire that
[1:41:15] within the midst of it a test or trial
[1:41:18] could not knock that desire out of
[1:41:21] him once that desire every one of us
[1:41:24] listen I remember when I had a desire to
[1:41:26] serve God as a young boy 13 years old
[1:41:29] but I also remember then when that
[1:41:31] desire thank God where did that desire
[1:41:32] come from it come from from God's own
[1:41:36] mind but once it came to that appointed
[1:41:39] time God leading to that place and now
[1:41:42] he comes to Quicken and bring that
[1:41:44] desire to where that desire is no longer
[1:41:47] like a seed that's
[1:41:49] underneath darkness and Gloom and void
[1:41:52] but once that that quickening power
[1:41:54] comes what does it do it comes upon that
[1:41:56] seed and that seed has what's needed to
[1:42:00] respond to the transforming
[1:42:03] power and what does it do that old
[1:42:07] ruling nature that was there is Cast
[1:42:08] Away the desires of the world is cast
[1:42:11] away and that seed doesn't start out as
[1:42:15] a fully mature plant but it's been
[1:42:19] quickened and it begins to
[1:42:22] grow it begins to grow he teaches us we
[1:42:27] fall we get back
[1:42:29] up he works with us we we begin to learn
[1:42:33] certain things sometimes maybe certain
[1:42:35] Pathways we walk we keep falling and
[1:42:37] falling and falling finally he gives us
[1:42:39] and the grace we realize so Lord help me
[1:42:41] I'm tired of making this same
[1:42:43] mistake what is it how do I keep falling
[1:42:45] in that same way sometimes it isn't
[1:42:48] altogether that God strips something out
[1:42:50] of us as far as like takes our very
[1:42:52] temperament and says come here Aon let
[1:42:54] me just rearrange you no sometimes what
[1:42:56] God has to do is like what he did for
[1:42:58] sister Bruce this is how you're made up
[1:43:00] right and you need to understand
[1:43:03] it God works with you like this and then
[1:43:07] the enemy will work
[1:43:09] in so you're made like that you know
[1:43:11] what you know what he's saying brother
[1:43:12] Aaron he's letting sister Bruce know as
[1:43:14] a daughter of God you're in
[1:43:16] control you're in
[1:43:19] control discern when them spirits come
[1:43:21] when those those times times come but
[1:43:24] it's true like we started out tonight
[1:43:26] preaching this Veil man this Veil this
[1:43:29] Veil is the
[1:43:30] one my soul has never got tired but I'll
[1:43:33] be honest with you there's been
[1:43:35] sometimes where I get I just get
[1:43:37] tired there sometimes my eyes will get
[1:43:39] so weary and things from reading and
[1:43:41] look at sometimes we get tired I know
[1:43:43] how it is even in a service sometimes we
[1:43:45] can come out of a service or a meeting
[1:43:46] you think
[1:43:51] woo I don't know about you sometimes on
[1:43:53] a Sunday service we get done with a
[1:43:54] Sunday service and all of a sudden after
[1:43:56] eventually things start continuing to
[1:43:58] come down come down come down you
[1:44:00] [Music]
[1:44:02] realize I was in places where Mortals
[1:44:05] don't
[1:44:08] walk and that inside part here we were
[1:44:11] sitting in Heavenly places and these
[1:44:13] bodies then after we after everything
[1:44:16] comes back down these bodies oh my we
[1:44:18] feel the effects of it don't we
[1:44:20] sometimes you just don't feel it on
[1:44:21] Sunday afternoon sometimes you feel it
[1:44:22] on Monday feel it on Tuesday is that
[1:44:26] right come on whether you're a preacher
[1:44:28] or not you feel it when you really get
[1:44:29] into a service right that's true but
[1:44:33] aren't you
[1:44:34] glad that we have a
[1:44:37] resource we get weary God doesn't shame
[1:44:40] us if you're in a place of weariness
[1:44:43] maybe in weakness maybe feel down
[1:44:47] listen God's not going to shame you and
[1:44:49] I sure ain't going to shame you but I
[1:44:51] will say this God still has has angels
[1:44:53] with soft
[1:44:54] hands you still have Angels ah they can

[1:45:19] think I just heard somebody say this a
[1:45:22] little bit ago comes to me I I just feel
[1:45:23] to say it right now cuz sometimes we
