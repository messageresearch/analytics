[37:18] you father how we think you Oh God Lord
[37:23] from the very depths of our heart Lord
[37:25] this is not just words of a song it's
[37:29] the very desire of a hardwood is to
[37:33] withhold nothing no chamber no area but
[37:38] at all things Lord God every part of our
[37:41] life being reconciled to you and father
[37:47] in every area every part Lord just as it
[37:49] was in the tabernacle in the temple
[37:53] every part every little thing was
[37:57] important if even to the snuffer dish
[37:59] Lord to every thing was of significance
[38:04] Lord and surrendered and purposed for
[38:07] your service
[38:08] granite Lord this is our desire Lord in
[38:12] all things Lord may you Lord just move
[38:15] through your word by your spirit tonight
[38:17] further draw us Lord away drawn Lord
[38:22] after you
[38:25] granny Lord we just pray that you'll
[38:27] just combine speak to our hearts Lord
[38:31] Lord God let us be hidden behind the
[38:34] cross smooth father God may you just be
[38:37] lifted up Lord ministered every life in
[38:41] every heart Lord every knee Lord
[38:42] Oh God we just commit ourselves in your
[38:46] hands look have your way now father we
[38:49] pray in the name of the Lord Jesus
[38:52] Christ
[38:56] let's turn to Ephesians 1 good to be in
[39:01] the house of the Lord Jesus chapter 1
[39:07] read just that portion of Scripture here
[39:12] are the places tonight we want to come
[39:20] back and we want to look in these steal
[39:23] water knowing that sheep and sheep sheep
[39:29] will drink from still waters where they
[39:32] can they can see their reflection he
[39:36] meant and we want to look into the Word
[39:39] of God and see ourselves even more
[39:42] clearly amen you know that's that's
[39:46] really important when you think of the
[39:51] slave who when they went and looked upon
[39:54] that plantation you're familiar with the
[39:57] story there was a character that stood
[40:01] out that they wanted to buy but he
[40:06] couldn't be bought as far as this right
[40:10] here he had been sold but who he was
[40:14] could not be bought good he couldn't be
[40:19] bought out for anything and when you
[40:22] look at that what was it that cost him
[40:25] remember they said does he have it
[40:26] easier you know movies paraphrase was it
[40:28] easier in life that he had better milk
[40:29] did he sleep in a better place it had
[40:31] nothing to do with his physical
[40:33] surroundings or whether it was he knew
[40:38] his daddy was a king back
[40:42] and that that personal understanding and
[40:48] knowledge of truth it had such an effect
[40:50] on his conduct and that's the thing I
[40:54] believe is all my heart that is sons and
[40:56] daughters of God the more and more as
[40:58] we're looking in the Word of God I'll
[41:01] tell you as we're looking at this and
[41:03] letting God minister to our life sin
[41:09] it's delivered to know who we are
[41:15] [Music]
[41:16] verse 3 blessed be the God and father of
[41:21] our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed
[41:25] us with all spiritual blessings in
[41:27] heavenly places in crime
[41:29] according as he hath chosen us in him
[41:33] before the foundation of the world that
[41:36] we should be holy and without blame
[41:40] before him in love having predestinated
[41:44] us unto the adoption of children by
[41:47] Jesus Christ to himself according to the
[41:51] good pleasure of his will to the praise
[41:54] of the glory of His grace wherein he has
[41:59] made us accepted in the beloved we'll
[42:04] just let you be seated and we'll
[42:06] continue read here may God bless the
[42:08] reading of his word let's continue here
[42:11] in verse 7 in whom we have redemption
[42:17] through his blood the forgiveness of
[42:20] sins according to the riches of His
[42:22] grace wherein he hath abounded toward us
[42:25] in all wisdom and prudence having made
[42:29] known unto us the mystery of his will
[42:32] according to his good pleasure which he
[42:36] hath purposed in himself that in the
[42:40] dispensation of the fullness of times he
[42:43] might gather together in one all things
[42:45] in Christ both which are in heaven and
[42:48] which are on earth even in him in whom
[42:51] also we have obtained an
[42:53] Aaron being predestinated according to
[42:56] the purpose of him who worketh all
[42:59] things after the counsel of his own will
[43:04] that's a very weighty and powerful
[43:09] statement there at the end and I want to
[43:11] just begin to look at a little bit of
[43:14] that tonight in that latter part that
[43:18] being predestinated according to the
[43:20] purpose of him who worketh all things
[43:23] after the counsel of his own will let me
[43:28] just go on here in verse 12 down to
[43:30] verse 14 that we should be to the praise
[43:33] of his glory who first trusted in Christ
[43:35] in whom ye also trusted after that you
[43:39] heard the word of truth the gospel of
[43:41] your salvation in whom also after that
[43:44] you believed you were sealed with that
[43:46] holy spirit of promise which is the
[43:48] earnest of our inheritance unto the
[43:51] redemption of the purchased possession
[43:53] unto the praise of his glory when we
[43:58] look here in these scriptures we begin
[44:02] to recognize that all that is spoken
[44:08] here it is God's solemn choosing it's
[44:14] God's doing we understand that it wasn't
[44:18] as we've looked at election and I may
[44:21] mention this some months ago when I had
[44:24] last time we spoke here on a Thursday
[44:26] that election and choosing is not like
[44:30] we remember picking teams in elementary
[44:34] school where you kind of get to know who
[44:38] can kick the kickball who can throw it
[44:40] who can catch it and you know you kind
[44:42] of avoid you you kind of avoid that they
[44:46] kind of get picked last and some of us
[44:50] may have been picked last down here we
[44:55] would even be when it would maybe even
[44:57] come to church standard or what would be
[45:01] considered to be high standard moral
[45:05] people be picked
[45:07] would have been picked last but God in
[45:10] his choosing is not choosing based on
[45:13] what he sees now God doesn't even elect
[45:18] and choose based on your decision that
[45:21] he had foreknowledge of your decision
[45:22] that's not even election you recognize
[45:26] that's still Arminianism that's not
[45:28] election but election is before he was
[45:32] even God he chose you before there was
[45:37] even a decision you made because if God
[45:39] chooses you based on him knowing your
[45:42] decision
[45:43] it still is you had something to do with
[45:44] it but election is not based on even God
[45:49] looking and saying I know what they're
[45:51] going to do but God does know what his
[45:55] children are going to do because they
[45:57] are his children they will respond to
[46:02] him as he makes himself known to them so
[46:07] the choosing of God when we're looking
[46:10] at this in the entirety of the scripture
[46:12] and brother Branham addresses this he
[46:14] says sometimes predestination he says
[46:17] sometimes people get the wrong thought
[46:19] on it as though that it's God that's
[46:22] gonna just do everything and pull you
[46:25] through a pipe but he said that's not
[46:28] the view of predestination at all
[46:30] predestination is even when you look at
[46:33] a seed that you plant out here it's
[46:36] already within it to be a tomato plant
[46:38] the Sun and the water coming upon it
[46:41] does not make it a tomato plant it only
[46:44] at the cent of water at the feeling of
[46:47] the warmth it begins to move and release
[46:50] the germ within it that was always there
[46:54] and so God Himself sending his word
[46:57] sending his life sending his presence
[47:00] God knows where each and every one of us
[47:03] were at he didn't lose one of us even in
[47:06] the bed of time where we would be in
[47:08] even when you look even sometimes in the
[47:11] greatness of the situations the mess and
[47:14] everything else but God himself knew and
[47:17] God knows that beneath
[47:19] in that seat though yet you'd be a seed
[47:21] in that seed is germ life are you with
[47:25] me in rising of the Sun the Prophet said
[47:27] the life is there in that seed but it
[47:30] needs the quickening power of God to
[47:34] come upon it to release that seed so
[47:36] then here God moves by our way but yet
[47:40] God can't believe for us that's where
[47:43] the scripture says of the gospel of our
[47:45] salvation when you heard it you
[47:47] recognize it to be the word of truth you
[47:49] said I believe that but yet even in the
[47:51] believing of that right there you've
[47:53] drawn to something it's something that
[47:54] begins to move upon your life and
[47:57] there's a warmth there's the scent of
[47:58] water it's something that begins to
[48:01] unfold to you this is what I'm looking
[48:04] for
[48:04] you begin to even say this is true yet
[48:07] you you don't even know what truth is
[48:09] but you begin to say this is it and here
[48:12] God is moving the whole time yet he
[48:14] won't believe for us but he stirs up and
[48:17] by moving of his word upon our life here
[48:21] then we come to a place and say I
[48:24] believe Lord and we start walking and
[48:26] you start walking in the word and as
[48:28] you're walking in the word the word is
[48:30] sanctifying the word is cleansing you
[48:33] you find things begin to move and drop
[48:35] away from your life what is that that's
[48:37] you yielding to God's voice and it's God
[48:40] sovereignly doing the work amen when we
[48:44] talk about sanctification it's walking
[48:46] on in you know sometimes people come to
[48:49] a place and they just want to stand
[48:50] still when I'm gonna get rid of this and
[48:52] I'm gonna get rid of this you have to
[48:53] keep walking in that light you've got to
[48:57] keep walking towards him you don't ever
[48:59] come to a place where you stand still
[49:01] and start well I'm gonna get rid of this
[49:02] and I'm gonna get rid of this let the
[49:04] Spirit of God that deals with your heart
[49:06] to get rid of this lay that aside that
[49:08] is him speaking lay aside every way
[49:11] every sin that does so easily beset us
[49:13] it's a blessing to even be stirred to
[49:16] desire to walk past those things that's
[49:18] God moving in your life what must I do
[49:21] yield to his voice and walk to him and
[49:25] you'll find that the same one who calls
[49:27] you strays your heart of that same one
[49:30] saint of
[49:31] as you cleanses you and that same one as
[49:34] you keep moving he brings you to a place
[49:36] that he himself remains known to you you
[49:40] are accepted in the beloved and you are
[49:44] always accepted but you and I have to
[49:47] come to that realization that I am
[49:50] accepted in him I was accepted in him
[49:53] before the foundation of the world
[49:57] I was identified there in the Lamb that
[50:00] was slain the lamb was slain with me and
[50:02] mind oh that God has done every little
[50:06] detail has been done with you and I in
[50:08] mind all the way through this great book
[50:11] of redemption this is God he's pouring
[50:13] out detail in this hour that you are not
[50:16] living in and how the Spirit of God
[50:18] moves upon the word to do what gives
[50:21] strength to you and I it's rapture and
[50:23] grace it's God that is providing for you
[50:27] and I strengthened this hour by pulling
[50:30] up these things right out of scripture
[50:32] that speak of the mystery of your life
[50:34] it's God's work it's God's work it's God
[50:39] moving in his time so what do we have to
[50:42] do wield to it is that right so here we
[50:48] are in the message adoption the Prophet
[50:51] says it like this he says he says see
[50:54] what kind of an inheritance being
[50:57] predestinated according to the purpose
[50:58] of him who worketh all things after the
[51:01] counsel of his own will
[51:03] before he was a Papa before he was gone
[51:06] before he was a savior before he was a
[51:09] healer before all this he predestinated
[51:12] put the lamb's name on the book look
[51:15] down through by his foreknowledge and
[51:17] seen your name and put it on there - we
[51:23] are identified when the Lambs name was
[51:26] put on our name was put on our
[51:31] identification is in the lamb who is the
[51:34] lamb it's God revealed from word to
[51:38] flesh
[51:39] it's Almighty God the deity that was in
[51:42] heaven came down to earth when we were
[51:46] could not man could not redeem himself
[51:49] you could not redeem yourself I could
[51:51] not redeem myself but God Himself the
[51:54] whole plan wins back to himself that
[51:58] there is nothing there's no one can do
[52:01] this but him let me say this very
[52:04] clearly there's only one who is
[52:07] responsible for the very perfection and
[52:10] the rapturing of his pride and that is
[52:13] him he is personally committed God never
[52:21] has ever got into anything that he said
[52:24] oops I bit off more than I could chew
[52:26] he has never because he already knew but
[52:30] what God knows has beneath all of the
[52:33] faults and everything the baggage that
[52:35] we've come with in life complexes and
[52:37] everything else God has confidence that
[52:39] his word will indeed prevail it's not an
[52:44] excuse for all these other things but it
[52:46] is the power that is residing in the sea
[52:49] that when the quickening power comes on
[52:51] it it will grow into the image and
[52:54] likeness of him who it is of whether
[53:00] Samuel X is very positive
[53:01] the gospel is positive it didn't say
[53:07] that he had he have begotten us into a
[53:09] onto it unto a deep discouragement he
[53:13] had begotten us unto a lively hope sure
[53:18] things come our ways that get us down
[53:20] and get us discouraged that's exactly
[53:22] right but that's why we need the
[53:23] ministering of the word that's why we
[53:25] need the fellowship among brothers and
[53:27] sisters that's why we need to walk on in
[53:29] the word that's why you want to pray
[53:31] even when you don't feel like praying
[53:33] even when you don't feel like coming to
[53:35] church when it's not convenient it is
[53:37] for our good not our flesh it's the man
[53:41] down on the inside
[53:43] the flash profit is nothing but the
[53:48] Inside Man is what's fed see the more
[53:53] you feed that Inside Man the more he's
[53:56] fed on the word the more he executes
[54:00] dominion over the outer man so what is
[54:10] it
[54:10] after a while we come in the world borne
[54:12] by sinful parents we walk around on the
[54:14] world you know first thing you know like
[54:16] that little hook nose Jew Paul you know
[54:18] and he was carrying out and the first
[54:19] thing something said here here here here
[54:21] I love that great theological term here
[54:26] you are walking about upon this earth
[54:27] and something comes along said give you
[54:29] here some of the begins to get your
[54:32] attention you begin to recognize there's
[54:37] there's something that's ministering to
[54:39] the longing and craving of which I have
[54:41] never felt a piece for I've never found
[54:46] anything but yet then begins to move
[54:47] upon your life and he says I have a
[54:50] father we begin to come predestinated us
[54:53] to our inheritance in him which was
[54:55] predestinated to us we inherited it
[54:57] before the foundation of the world
[55:02] because we realized Jesus never gave us
[55:05] our inheritance my inheritance was
[55:11] always right the jury preached about it
[55:16] on Sunday we were speaking about a
[55:17] funeral that inheritance always was
[55:19] eternal life what the Lord Jesus came is
[55:23] to step down and make a way that we can
[55:26] go to our inheritance for he is the way
[55:31] to that inheritance so through him we
[55:35] have obtained and that word obtained
[55:37] means to take by possession what is
[55:41] rightfully ours that which has been
[55:44] designated to us just like in the land
[55:47] that scripture when it says obtained
[55:48] when it's talking about even the
[55:50] possession that was in the land of
[55:52] promise God knew exactly where this one
[55:54] tribe would be this tribe would be this
[55:56] tribe
[55:57] be and God supplied and ensured that
[55:59] even when that that particular head of
[56:02] the tribe was coming forth the Spirit of
[56:05] God moved upon those mothers as they was
[56:07] giving birth and their name held the
[56:10] mystery of their positioning in the land
[56:13] they men and that name when we're
[56:16] looking at the revealing of his name and
[56:18] his name is called the Word of God as
[56:21] his name is revealed you and I are
[56:24] identified within him and it positions
[56:27] us in Christ is that right we come into
[56:33] a place to where the Bible is no longer
[56:35] just a book it's not just a letter it's
[56:37] light it holy it's it's it's truly we're
[56:42] not just saying this it's a love letter
[56:44] it holds a mystery we can we can read
[56:47] about answer if we see ourselves we read
[56:49] Nehemiah was he ourselves we don't see
[56:53] it in terms of history of a day gone by
[56:55] we see it that it's God's leadership and
[56:58] guidance and every part of it is rich in
[57:00] their and expressed that even now it's
[57:02] yet still even though packed in but yet
[57:05] it prophesied of this hour is that right
[57:11] now watch this here in the scripture I
[57:13] want to just I want to go in back into a
[57:16] few places here tonight and I want to
[57:19] come back into a few places with this
[57:22] and showing if we haven't been able to
[57:25] get to a place to where to show how God
[57:28] work as all things after the counsel of
[57:30] his own will sometimes when God is
[57:35] moving it's not just some time when God
[57:39] is working everything after the counsel
[57:41] of his own will there are times that it
[57:45] looks like it's defeated there are times
[57:50] that God is having steps to be taken
[57:53] that looks like why is this step being
[57:57] taken now this is within every aspect of
[58:01] our life this is where the trust itself
[58:05] trusting in the Lord who's leading and
[58:07] guiding our pathway
[58:09] God knows our knee he knows what we have
[58:15] Nita God even knew exactly what to say
[58:17] he knows even what to say God already
[58:20] had my already knew
[58:22] concerning the service he knew what
[58:23] words to say he already knew what I need
[58:29] would be sometimes when we're looking at
[58:33] it it don't seem like him now let me
[58:35] just qualify this statement as well
[58:38] sometimes there's things that are in our
[58:40] life where the judgments and decisions
[58:42] that we've made that are they're just
[58:45] flat-out mistakes I mean I don't care
[58:48] what kind of spirituality you try to
[58:49] sprinkle on they still have the stink of
[58:53] our own decisions our own will you
[58:56] understand you know it's just a mess
[58:59] nobody wants to learn no but so we we
[59:01] understand but the Bible does tell us in
[59:03] the book of Romans that all things work
[59:05] together for the good he didn't say
[59:09] everything is good
[59:12] you didn't say everything's good I'm not
[59:15] going to ask how many in here like
[59:16] chocolate cake but you're not gonna find
[59:20] those of you like chocolate cake say man
[59:23] I love flour just give me a cup of flour
[59:25] no sir you better put eggs with that put
[59:29] butter with that put everything else you
[59:30] need with it in order to bring out the
[59:33] chocolate cake but all things work
[59:36] together I don't want just an egg and
[59:42] you tell me it's chocolate cake
[59:46] sorry we're back to food examples
[59:53] watch how the Scriptures speak this and
[59:57] I want you to see how God sovereignly
[1:00:01] watches over to bring about bring the
[1:00:06] past his word in our life here when we
[1:00:13] look at at this place here in Romans
[1:00:17] chapter 9 Paul deals with the election
[1:00:21] of God he's speaking of this and he says
[1:00:25] within it not as though the Word of God
[1:00:28] had taken an effect for they are not all
[1:00:29] Israel which are Israel neither because
[1:00:33] they are the seed of Abraham are they
[1:00:34] all children but an Isaac shall thy seed
[1:00:37] be called
[1:00:38] and as Paul goes on he says they which
[1:00:43] are the children of flesh these are not
[1:00:45] the children of God but the children of
[1:00:46] the promise are counted for the seed but
[1:00:50] this is the word of promise at this time
[1:00:51] will I come and Sarah shall have a son
[1:00:54] and not only this but when Rebekah also
[1:00:57] had conceived by one even by our Father
[1:00:59] Isaac but the children being not yet
[1:01:01] born neither having done any good or
[1:01:04] evil that the purpose of God according
[1:01:07] to election might stand not of works but
[1:01:10] of him that call him it was said unto
[1:01:17] her the elder I want you to catch this
[1:01:20] here it was said unto her the elder
[1:01:22] shall serve the younger
[1:01:27] as it is written Jacob have I loved but
[1:01:31] Esau have I hated
[1:01:37] think about this for a moment when
[1:01:41] Israel was in a situation where they
[1:01:46] called into question God's law they
[1:01:52] called God's love into question it
[1:01:54] wasn't God's love but it what it was
[1:01:58] that called it into question was their
[1:02:00] thinking
[1:02:03] how they thought God's love ought to be
[1:02:07] think of this here it is in the very
[1:02:09] first part of Malachi but you think the
[1:02:13] spiritual condition of the people the
[1:02:16] spiritual condition and and they begin
[1:02:19] to call and question the love of God and
[1:02:21] God for them and God refers them back to
[1:02:25] this place you see Conn doesn't come
[1:02:27] around and say ah you know I love you
[1:02:29] you know I love you you know I love you
[1:02:31] you know I love you God takes them to
[1:02:33] proof because God follows his own word
[1:02:37] in the book of John that said let us not
[1:02:40] love in word a deed only but it's
[1:02:43] expressive because love is not an idea I
[1:02:48] hope you with me now love is not a
[1:02:51] concept love real real love is a person
[1:02:59] not a concept it's not an idea
[1:03:01] it cannot remember even the man who
[1:03:04] wrote there on the on that wall there in
[1:03:07] that insane or in the asylum that place
[1:03:10] you your mind cannot even fathom and
[1:03:13] comprehend the love of God and God
[1:03:16] reminds Israel during this time and you
[1:03:19] know what I'm glad that God reminds you
[1:03:23] and I he'll remind us where he's brought
[1:03:27] us from he'll remind us of his care
[1:03:29] he'll remind us how he's watched over
[1:03:31] I'm glad for that because sometimes we
[1:03:35] forget but God don't forget and you
[1:03:37] begin to see that the experiences and
[1:03:40] the tests and the trials and everything
[1:03:43] he brought you for he wasn't just a
[1:03:45] bunch of happenstance and things falling
[1:03:47] around God was showing himself
[1:03:50] personally to you that he is committed
[1:03:53] and dedicated to his word and you are a
[1:03:57] part of his word
[1:03:58] [Applause]
[1:04:02] glory be to God
[1:04:08] Malachi moana says I have loved you
[1:04:11] verse 2 saith the Lord yet you say we're
[1:04:13] in hostile of this was not Esau Jacob's
[1:04:18] brother saith the Lord yet I loved Jacob
[1:04:26] God is he goes into these things I just
[1:04:30] I don't want to continue to read through
[1:04:32] that but God begins to make known of
[1:04:35] what happened with Esau because the Esau
[1:04:39] choice but then God also let it be known
[1:04:43] because of the choice that Jacob made
[1:04:46] but how did Jacob make the choice that
[1:04:49] he made it's because that choice was
[1:04:53] already made by God that's why when the
[1:04:57] person says I chose to serve God no you
[1:04:59] didn't you only reflected the choice God
[1:05:02] made that's all you did because if it's
[1:05:06] you and God said alright you're gonna
[1:05:08] serve me
[1:05:08] I'll predestinate you you still got
[1:05:10] glory in it but because before any
[1:05:14] choice any decision why are we that of
[1:05:18] election because we are of God's own
[1:05:20] loins my children are not my children
[1:05:25] because they would do this and they
[1:05:26] would do that and they would do this and
[1:05:28] they would do that they come from my
[1:05:30] loins and that's where the choosing and
[1:05:33] election of Almighty God it's not about
[1:05:36] what you can do or what you would do it
[1:05:39] was God chose you because you are a part
[1:05:42] of him and it unfolds in time now watch
[1:05:52] this here let's just watch watch God's
[1:05:55] care I want you to watch this grande
[1:05:57] just does not give his word and he
[1:05:59] doesn't watch over it he watches over
[1:06:01] his word he watches over he watches to
[1:06:04] see that that word is fulfilled that's
[1:06:06] why it is so crucial that's why the call
[1:06:10] is be in Christ's
[1:06:13] amen it's God working God moving God
[1:06:16] drawing
[1:06:17] what's God how he watches over his seed
[1:06:20] the scriptures they they tell us here in
[1:06:23] the book of Genesis and I I'm just gonna
[1:06:25] refer to a few places here and some of
[1:06:29] this a little bit of review but I just
[1:06:31] can't get away from there's just such
[1:06:32] inspiration I tell you it's just been
[1:06:35] flowing over weeks and I thought I was
[1:06:37] just gonna be able to fly to Connecticut
[1:06:39] on my own because you begin to see the
[1:06:43] sovereignty of God and God watching over
[1:06:45] everything because here when in the
[1:06:48] situation where here Rebecca she is
[1:06:52] brought to Isaac and Isaac the scripture
[1:06:54] said begin to entreat the Lord and he
[1:06:56] began to make supplication and asking
[1:06:59] God who you know to give children that
[1:07:01] his wife would be able to conceive when
[1:07:04] the scripture tells us in verse 22 of
[1:07:06] Genesis 25 that the children struggled
[1:07:09] together within her Anna and she said if
[1:07:12] it be so why am i thus and she went to
[1:07:15] inquire of the Lord you know that's what
[1:07:17] that there is a lot of things we could
[1:07:18] stop on that verse there was something
[1:07:21] going on within her she didn't put a
[1:07:25] fuss of paints a post on Facebook come
[1:07:29] on somebody about everything that was
[1:07:31] going on with him she inquired of the
[1:07:34] Lord
[1:07:35] you know why Rebecca knew that he holds
[1:07:39] the mystery of my life when I was down
[1:07:42] there and it was God the angel of the
[1:07:44] Lord that led me to the well at the time
[1:07:47] when Eliezer came there it was God that
[1:07:50] arranged all that time so she recognizes
[1:07:52] that there's nothing by chance was God
[1:07:55] what's she doing she knows her life it
[1:07:58] has been planned out by Almighty God so
[1:08:00] she's looking to him who has set the
[1:08:03] plan that he would reveal to her what is
[1:08:05] taking place right now it wasn't
[1:08:11] comfortable she was struggling within
[1:08:13] but she inquired of the Lord he has the
[1:08:17] answer
[1:08:18] the you it's me it's okay sometimes
[1:08:21] they're going you can talk with people
[1:08:22] and that's all you end up getting is
[1:08:24] people's ideas
[1:08:25] come on somebody all you end up getting
[1:08:28] this peoples doctrine ooh hallelujah but
[1:08:33] she went and inquired of the Lord to
[1:08:38] hold it be to God and the Lord look at
[1:08:41] this God honored this and the Lord said
[1:08:44] unto her two nations are in thy womb two
[1:08:48] manner of people shall be separated from
[1:08:50] thy bowels and the one people shall be
[1:08:53] stronger than the other people and the
[1:08:54] elder shall serve the younger and when
[1:08:56] her days were to be fulfilled behold
[1:08:59] there were twins in her room and the
[1:09:01] first came out red all over like a hairy
[1:09:03] garment and they call him Esau and after
[1:09:05] that his brother came out in his hand
[1:09:07] took hold on Esau's heel and his name
[1:09:09] was called Jacob and he saw was
[1:09:10] threescore years old when she bare him
[1:09:12] and the boys grew now think of this it
[1:09:16] begins to talk about Esau cunning hunter
[1:09:18] man of the field Jacob was a plain man
[1:09:22] dwelling in tents lazy you recognize
[1:09:32] this well you know it God showing you
[1:09:35] don't merit it no matter how good a
[1:09:39] person is you can never merit the grace
[1:09:43] of God Esau was a much better man now
[1:09:54] that don't mean don't clean your house
[1:09:57] they don't mean brothers no you can go
[1:10:00] around and not pick up your clothes come
[1:10:02] on now don't be thinking like praise the
[1:10:05] Lord I can be a slob now no daddy what
[1:10:08] we're talking about you still be a real
[1:10:10] godly woman a real godly gentleman that
[1:10:16] all right think some of you got nervous
[1:10:18] I had to put that in the sisters are
[1:10:21] getting nervous the brothers were
[1:10:22] getting nervous we're almost going to
[1:10:23] have marriage counseling here but the
[1:10:26] ball is grew and Isaac loved Esau
[1:10:30] because he did eat of his venison but
[1:10:33] Rebekah loved Jacob I want to just just
[1:10:36] come in on this just for a few moments
[1:10:38] here's Rebecca she's a spiritual woman
[1:10:44] she catches as we seen back in Genesis
[1:10:48] 24 the time to come to the well of water
[1:10:52] she's moved upon by the angel of the
[1:10:55] Lord now being spiritual doesn't mean
[1:10:59] that things always stand out but there's
[1:11:02] something that within that can witness
[1:11:04] there's something here
[1:11:06] blue ram tells us that Abraham saw them
[1:11:10] three walking he said Abraham thought
[1:11:12] something was spiritual about them it
[1:11:16] was something resonated with an Abraham
[1:11:18] there's something about him he he didn't
[1:11:24] I didn't say anything to Abraham Abraham
[1:11:26] said my lord he bowed himself down he
[1:11:30] was made known to him here is Rebekah a
[1:11:33] spiritual woman God reveals to her
[1:11:37] what's going on inside her there's a
[1:11:43] struggle and God reveals it God reveals
[1:11:45] to her the Younger shall serve or the
[1:11:49] elder shall serve the younger
[1:11:50] and wants you to think of this Rebekah
[1:11:54] knows this and here are both boys let me
[1:11:59] ask you do you think Rebecca treated
[1:12:01] them any differently you think she gave
[1:12:05] let's say hot eggs the jacob cold eggs
[1:12:09] the esau
[1:12:15] No as far as a mother would go she was
[1:12:19] there too mother
[1:12:20] each one of them when he saw fell off of
[1:12:24] the bike with training wheels she kissed
[1:12:28] his boo-boo are you with me
[1:12:32] she even what was revealed to her listen
[1:12:35] friends this is what I'm trying to say
[1:12:37] what was revealed held grace in it grace
[1:12:40] took effect in her heart and life and
[1:12:42] grace would not allow anything you buy
[1:12:48] that would hinder the promise that's why
[1:12:53] when we went off when the Prophet tells
[1:12:55] us it's we need to pray for revelation
[1:12:58] he said it's more important to you than
[1:13:00] perhaps you realized it's not talking
[1:13:03] about knowledge real revelation is the
[1:13:06] divine imparting of Almighty God it's
[1:13:10] God unfolding himself to you and I and
[1:13:13] when that happens and as God is doing
[1:13:15] that you recognize how little you are
[1:13:19] you recognize it's not you that's done
[1:13:22] it because all of our studying and
[1:13:23] everything it won't it won't unearth
[1:13:26] it's God see then what does that do its
[1:13:31] grace working in our life
[1:13:32] so here's Rebecca here she is as moving
[1:13:35] in this time well I believe it on my
[1:13:38] heart she kept in her heart what was
[1:13:41] spoke to her she pondered those things
[1:13:43] in her heart she thought about them what
[1:13:46] God had said that the elder shall serve
[1:13:48] the younger
[1:13:49] she thought of that and to think of how
[1:13:51] that when you look at this when you look
[1:13:53] at this thought Isaac Isaac loved Esau
[1:13:56] because he did eat of his venison or
[1:13:58] Rebecca loved Jacob the message is
[1:14:02] broadcast to all is that right all who
[1:14:06] come within ear of hearing it but it is
[1:14:09] the elect to whom it is revealed though
[1:14:12] although many can hear but the message
[1:14:15] comes with the intent to lay claim on
[1:14:18] the elect
[1:14:21] so here's Jacob when we look at it here
[1:14:25] obtaining the birthright Jacobs burst
[1:14:29] is against your birth order my birth
[1:14:34] order was against me but there's a lot
[1:14:38] God was telling Israel in the book of
[1:14:40] Malachi look when everything was against
[1:14:43] Jacob I was for Jacob and I am still for
[1:14:49] Jacob hey men see it would have seemed
[1:14:55] that everything working all things after
[1:14:57] the counsel of his own will he would
[1:14:58] have seemed when we look at it because
[1:15:00] the birthright belongs to the firstborn
[1:15:02] it would just make sense naturally that
[1:15:05] Jacob would be the first one born but
[1:15:08] God's showing a mystery God showing the
[1:15:10] mystery in your life in my life that the
[1:15:14] first birth in our life was not Jacob
[1:15:16] the first birth was Esau but that which
[1:15:21] is down there hidden beneath is Jacob is
[1:15:25] the elect of God and without the Lord
[1:15:31] Jesus Christ the light of God the gospel
[1:15:33] coming along I pass away we don't stand
[1:15:37] a chance
[1:15:38] but God watches over his word here comes
[1:15:47] here I want you to think of this friends
[1:15:49] these are not things just by chance that
[1:15:51] Jacob stint tends to be out sodding
[1:15:53] pottage here he is sodding apologies
[1:15:57] he's make repairing this he knows what
[1:15:59] time that that that Esau is coming in
[1:16:01] from the field you can say well look he
[1:16:03] was planning that but I'm asking you who
[1:16:05] moved upon Jacob to do that who moved
[1:16:11] upon him God why was that because Jacob
[1:16:15] had a value of the birthright he was
[1:16:19] seeking after that birthright joka Jacob
[1:16:22] wanted the Holy Ghost more than anything
[1:16:25] he meant more to him if has the perfect
[1:16:27] places that it's true it meant more than
[1:16:30] anything job whatever the Holy Ghost
[1:16:33] meant everything
[1:16:36] to Jacob when did Jacob get that
[1:16:40] valuation of the birthright so you can
[1:16:46] see when Esau comes in and he says give
[1:16:49] me some of your father's I'm not ready
[1:16:51] to faint
[1:16:53] but as Jake as they sell me this day by
[1:16:59] birthright they're right tell me this
[1:17:05] day that birthright and Esau despises
[1:17:09] the birthday prophet does this
[1:17:11] birthright have for me you see what
[1:17:12] Jacob is what he saw was doing he was
[1:17:14] looking at the birthright but he was
[1:17:17] putting his own physical needs above the
[1:17:22] birthright
[1:17:23] oh if I get this or if I you know if I
[1:17:29] receive the Holy Ghost what could happen
[1:17:30] god it takes God to bring a person
[1:17:33] beyond that to bring them to a place to
[1:17:37] where they need that more than they need
[1:17:39] their own pride what if I if I if I
[1:17:44] begin to do this if I really begin to
[1:17:46] sell out it takes God to bring a person
[1:17:48] into that place but he saw it looks at
[1:17:52] it is then what what good what good will
[1:17:54] it do me you know the difference between
[1:17:55] Jacob and Esau Esau had no vision he had
[1:18:01] hair he had in his possession but he had
[1:18:03] no vision that's a difference we know
[1:18:07] one is not just having the word but the
[1:18:09] have vision is to have faith in that
[1:18:12] word because faith gives sight beyond
[1:18:16] Esau did not have any vision beyond that
[1:18:20] temple Esau was interested in satisfying
[1:18:23] himself he was interested in living for
[1:18:27] himself
[1:18:28] let me say this is why even when the
[1:18:31] Prophet says Esau was never a type of
[1:18:33] carnal church members that are never
[1:18:36] able to climb into the promise you know
[1:18:38] what the whole secret is is because I'm
[1:18:40] not willing to die when you're willing
[1:18:42] to fully surrender a person that's
[1:18:44] willing willing to fully surrender God
[1:18:47] will fully come in when a person gets
[1:18:50] Astrid God comes down is that right
[1:18:56] I think of how even the scripture says
[1:19:01] that that Esau he sold it look how Paul
[1:19:04] would speak about it for one morsel Paul
[1:19:08] speaks of the menial thing that he cast
[1:19:10] aside his birthright for this a mere
[1:19:13] pleasure of the world he cast it aside
[1:19:18] but for Jacob he valued it why did he
[1:19:22] value it because within him Jacob was
[1:19:27] elect did he have the birthright no but
[1:19:31] he was going to obtain it I want you to
[1:19:36] watch this how's it for the RAM place
[1:19:38] isn't the calling of Abraham
[1:19:40] I hope this touches your heart the way
[1:19:42] it's just touch mine these are familiar
[1:19:44] and statements the Prophet make Abraham
[1:19:47] is election
[1:19:48] don't forget this anyhow Abraham is
[1:19:50] God's election Isaac his justification
[1:19:53] Jacob grace anybody would know I believe
[1:19:56] in grace see what God did for Jacob and
[1:19:58] Joseph perfection he goes in the message
[1:20:03] Israel in the church are three said
[1:20:05] called election and Abraham
[1:20:07] justification and Isaac Grace and Jacob
[1:20:09] anybody that ever read Jacobs life no
[1:20:12] you have to believe in grace it's grace
[1:20:14] in Jacob they're right grace as we said
[1:20:21] is unmerited grace is what's provided
[1:20:26] God provided for Israel lamb prophet and
[1:20:32] a pillar fire is that right that's what
[1:20:36] grace did but in order to come under
[1:20:40] grace you have to receive great after
[1:20:44] receive the leadership of what grace is
[1:20:47] pointing you to is that right it was God
[1:20:51] letting him know this is their exodus
[1:20:53] out of Egypt
[1:20:54] grace lets them know they don't know how
[1:20:56] to get out but grace provides for them
[1:21:01] the way out
[1:21:04] so grace isn't has it's been such a
[1:21:07] mockery of way grace has been painted in
[1:21:10] this day it's not just new to this day
[1:21:13] the scripture speaks up in the book of
[1:21:15] Jude they turned the grace of our God
[1:21:18] into lasciviousness disgrace because
[1:21:23] real grace is not God wholeness eyes
[1:21:26] eyes closed but grace is him providing
[1:21:30] what's needed for us and we accept what
[1:21:35] grace provided and come under it over
[1:21:45] and over you hear the Prophet make the
[1:21:46] statement the Israel made their rational
[1:21:49] mistake rational mistake who keeps on
[1:21:53] going because what did they do they
[1:21:56] failed to walk in what God had provided
[1:22:00] it's the tendency within man to want to
[1:22:05] do something clear from back and in Eden
[1:22:08] making aprons of fig leaves wanting to
[1:22:14] do something instead of walking in what
[1:22:16] God that's why it's important than what
[1:22:19] God is opening within his word walk in
[1:22:22] it listen friends just to say that was a
[1:22:24] good service and you walk and you don't
[1:22:26] pray over it you don't give yourself to
[1:22:28] it you're not walking in it you're not a
[1:22:30] recipient of grace that's the destitute
[1:22:33] despite under the spirit of grace it's
[1:22:35] the spirit of grace that brings the word
[1:22:38] to us it's continent deals with our life
[1:22:41] it's up for us to submit ourselves to
[1:22:43] what grace has provided pray over those
[1:22:46] things you're not a stretch to say Lord
[1:22:48] let the word that has come that brings
[1:22:50] such positivity and makes known to us
[1:22:53] that authority Lord let it rain in my
[1:22:55] heart that I have an effect on my
[1:22:59] conduct have an effect on my mind have
[1:23:01] an effect on my behavior I have an
[1:23:03] effect on my objectives have an effect
[1:23:05] on my vision the wife was meant and sent
[1:23:09] to bring an effect and that effect as to
[1:23:14] where it becomes Christ displayed
[1:23:16] Christ shown in our lives we don't want
[1:23:19] to just talk about Christ understand to
[1:23:22] talk about just to talk about this
[1:23:24] message is not to go into rapture it
[1:23:27] must be applied daily living janely hour
[1:23:31] after hour moment after moment it's
[1:23:34] meant to be applied my where's tango
[1:23:48] what's this God working everything after
[1:23:52] the counsel of his own will the
[1:23:54] scripture says in Genesis 27 1 and it
[1:23:58] came to pass then when Isaac was old and
[1:24:01] his eyes were dim so that he could not
[1:24:04] see he called Esau his eldest son and
[1:24:06] said unto him my son and he said behold
[1:24:09] there I am behold now I am old and I
[1:24:12] know not the day of my death and he
[1:24:14] doesn't want to do going on the field if
[1:24:17] the venison prepare it and my soul may
[1:24:20] bless thee before I die the scripture
[1:24:23] says that in verse 5 Rebekah heard when
[1:24:26] Isaac's picked the east on Isaac is an
[1:24:33] instrument of the Lord you believe that
[1:24:36] God's prophet but the scripture says it
[1:24:40] came to pass that Isaac's eyes read them
[1:24:48] the blessing of the birthright it's that
[1:24:53] time
[1:24:54] look how God is working everything after
[1:24:57] the counsel of his own will
[1:24:58] he's moving everything in position it
[1:25:01] would look like why is I said going
[1:25:03] blind right now this is the time you
[1:25:04] ought to have his eyesight but God knows
[1:25:06] he know he's God's prophet but yet he's
[1:25:09] still a man
[1:25:10] blood said I'm not gonna let him use his
[1:25:12] eyesight and his intellect to make a
[1:25:14] choice hey man because my thoughts are
[1:25:18] higher than your thoughts so what was
[1:25:21] not going to do that God's choice would
[1:25:24] be made known by his personal presence
[1:25:26] and vindication he would not be by the
[1:25:29] natural oh my it would not be the
[1:25:33] natural I say of the Prophet but it was
[1:25:35] a spiritual eyesight
[1:25:38] I'm telling you brother and sister that
[1:25:40] is what you and I are under and have
[1:25:42] come under is not the natural eyesight
[1:25:45] of a man
[1:25:46] have been a prophetic eyesight God fight
[1:25:49] in line with his word and the Spirit of
[1:25:52] God has moved right down there and we
[1:25:54] can see ourselves in the word it's not
[1:25:57] the intellect of man we would not have
[1:25:59] been chosen but God said I chose you not
[1:26:05] my intellect not by the natural eyesight
[1:26:07] but by him chosen us before him in love
[1:26:16] Isaac didn't discern but God discerned
[1:26:20] it was Jacob remember how that Rebekah
[1:26:24] here she tells she tells Jacob what to
[1:26:27] do what's God doing working everything
[1:26:31] after the counsel of his own will God
[1:26:34] already is the choosing Jacob is to
[1:26:38] receive the birthright blessing if we're
[1:26:41] looking at this unfolding right even if
[1:26:43] you're not a fingernail chewer you'd be
[1:26:45] chewing them boy this is running close
[1:26:48] but God has Rebekah there and he's given
[1:26:55] that word to Rebecca and Rebecca is able
[1:26:58] to catch what Isaac is saying and she
[1:27:01] makes it known to Jacob go do this Jacob
[1:27:04] go get a kid out of the flock bring it
[1:27:07] to me I'll prepare it I know what spices
[1:27:09] and by the way go get goodly garments of
[1:27:12] Esau and put on goodly garments and by
[1:27:14] the way mother wonder what they're gonna
[1:27:16] say yeah my brother's a hairy man she
[1:27:19] and she want us to do put goat hair upon
[1:27:21] him hey man she's risen every piece of
[1:27:25] the offering that's gonna go before
[1:27:27] Isaac hey man here is Jacob coming in
[1:27:31] there what's he doing he's submitting
[1:27:33] himself it's God working all things
[1:27:35] after the counsel of his own will
[1:27:37] remember he says hello mother I can't go
[1:27:40] in there
[1:27:41] what did she say son my son hearken unto
[1:27:45] my voice what authority obey my voice
[1:27:49] she said for thy curse be upon me what
[1:27:53] is that it's the Spirit of God the Holy
[1:27:56] Spirit screaming out in Atonement
[1:27:59] I bore your judgment I bore your curse I
[1:28:03] bore your shame
[1:28:06] amen when you were away without
[1:28:08] fellowship but I have sought you out you
[1:28:11] are called the city shout out backing
[1:28:15] and drew you into myself
[1:28:17] what's Jacob doing he's walking with
[1:28:20] what is provided he's being told what to
[1:28:26] do they come out of the Upper Room the
[1:28:35] word stirs the hearts what must we do to
[1:28:39] be safe see the desire was to be saved
[1:28:45] there's leadership there what's God
[1:28:48] doing watching over his word here's the
[1:28:52] eunuch down there reading in the Book of
[1:28:55] Isaiah he's longing to understand
[1:28:59] longing for life what is God doing
[1:29:03] watching over his word God catches
[1:29:06] Philip away takes him down there and
[1:29:10] Philip draws near and says do you
[1:29:12] understand what you're reading
[1:29:15] there's no who's the Prophet speaking of
[1:29:18] himself for another God used his body to
[1:29:25] do what give leadership to his elect
[1:29:33] it's gone working in the simplicity and
[1:29:36] the sovereignty working all things after
[1:29:38] the counsel of his own will you know how
[1:29:42] the story goes on that we went through
[1:29:44] this here I'm just reviewing here
[1:29:46] tonight it's setting some stages for
[1:29:48] some things with Jacob's life but that
[1:29:50] you can see that it is indeed the grace
[1:29:53] of God that's within Jacob's life
[1:30:01] when you see after that even esau when
[1:30:06] he comes in he realizes jacob's already
[1:30:09] been there but then here Esau comes in
[1:30:13] and afterwards he's asking don't you
[1:30:16] have a blessing for me he just wants a
[1:30:20] blessing that's there really that's the
[1:30:22] only reason he looked at the birthright
[1:30:23] but he didn't have the right value of
[1:30:27] the birthright understand what I'm
[1:30:31] saying he didn't have the right value of
[1:30:34] the Holy Ghost to Esau the Holy Ghost
[1:30:40] was just enough to make him get happy at
[1:30:42] church I just want to get happy enough
[1:30:46] to where I dance I shall I feel good
[1:30:50] Jacob had a longing to be changed it's a
[1:30:58] different a different approach a
[1:31:01] different value that's why in our lives
[1:31:05] how precious it is if you find in your
[1:31:09] heart a value or the Holy Spirit a value
[1:31:13] for the Word of God Lord let your word
[1:31:17] live in me let it change and transform
[1:31:22] my life Lord from glory unto glory the
[1:31:29] scripture tells us here I'm done
[1:31:38] it's made known to Rebecca or what Esau
[1:31:43] has said that he's going to do to Jacob
[1:31:46] and Rebecca is fearful once you catch
[1:31:51] this she's fearful
[1:31:53] look at the wisdom of God here the
[1:31:57] wisdom of God is moving and it would
[1:32:01] look like no why is Jacob being sent
[1:32:04] away but there was why there was elected
[1:32:13] one that he had to get moved around and
[1:32:19] so here it's put up on Rebecca's heart
[1:32:23] she talks to Jacob but then she goes to
[1:32:25] Isaac you've got the town
[1:32:28] talk to Isaac tell him not to take I'm
[1:32:30] fearful unless he'll take one of the
[1:32:33] daughters from around here if you look
[1:32:37] what but you look what was in East halls
[1:32:39] heart the whole time he came out because
[1:32:43] the scripture says when Esau heard what
[1:32:46] Isaac and them had said unto Jacob
[1:32:50] regarding the wife he went and took a
[1:32:53] woman of Canaan or was it he despised he
[1:32:59] just didn't despise it here but it came
[1:33:00] into manifestation he despised it he
[1:33:04] despised Jacob but God had his hand on
[1:33:09] Jacob's life the birthright and already
[1:33:16] come in as far as the pronouncing upon
[1:33:19] his life by his father that order was
[1:33:24] according to God's choosing God moved
[1:33:28] everything right in line you know
[1:33:31] friends sometimes I put it just like
[1:33:35] this here without I don't want to go any
[1:33:36] further but I want you to think of this
[1:33:39] sometimes even when you bring this down
[1:33:41] to your own natural life
[1:33:42] if listen if the preaching of the word
[1:33:44] of God if it stays just in a manner to
[1:33:46] where it's just doctrinal level then it
[1:33:49] never gets down to the application
[1:33:52] understand what I'm saying it's like we
[1:33:55] could preach on we preach on the white
[1:33:56] horse rider preach on the on the red
[1:33:58] horse rider and the black horse rider
[1:33:59] but I don't want to just leave him out
[1:34:01] here in doctrine it comes down into your
[1:34:05] online our lives person the word brings
[1:34:11] discernment and there's times that
[1:34:14] sometimes there's things happen and
[1:34:17] places and things going on that we may
[1:34:20] not be able to make sense of but like
[1:34:24] what Rebecca did she inquired of the
[1:34:28] Lord she didn't tell the Lord stop this
[1:34:33] gorgeous she wanted to know first of all
[1:34:35] what's going on you know what that was
[1:34:40] it put her open for the Lord to speak to
[1:34:43] God is working everything after the
[1:34:46] counsel of his own will I don't mean to
[1:34:52] belabor that scripture but I'm going to
[1:34:55] because it is evident within Jacob's
[1:34:58] life it's evident in each one of their
[1:34:59] lives God is moving
[1:35:01] everything's sovereignly according to
[1:35:04] his own will sometimes our pathways
[1:35:10] those we come in contact with things
[1:35:13] that take place do you realize your
[1:35:15] tests and trials they're not the happens
[1:35:22] then tests and trials are not by boy
[1:35:25] what did i do what did I do to deserve
[1:35:28] this
[1:35:29] I should have been to lunch early today
[1:35:30] now at the end of the line I got the
[1:35:31] leftovers no that's not what testing
[1:35:35] trials testing trials think of how that
[1:35:38] the Prophet by the Spirit of God put him
[1:35:39] before us he said personal temptation
[1:35:44] it's the same enemy that we faith we're
[1:35:48] all tried we're all tested it's the way
[1:35:52] that he comes and he comes because even
[1:35:56] Satan studies and knows yet what he
[1:36:02] doesn't know
[1:36:04] is that real reality on the inside but
[1:36:10] through every test and through every
[1:36:12] trial its Christ in us who rises it's
[1:36:21] him working everything you believe that
[1:36:24] I want to be sensitive to his voice
[1:36:27] sometimes where we see the Spirit of the
[1:36:29] Lord moving through Rebecca the
[1:36:30] spiritual woman a type of a spiritual
[1:36:33] Church of the Living God
[1:36:34] she's catching at that moment what needs
[1:36:37] to be done and she's moved what's God
[1:36:40] doing watching over his work aren't you
[1:36:43] thankful for them not to think of how
[1:36:46] that God has watched over his work that
[1:36:48] same God he knows your need knows your
[1:36:51] situation knows mine isn't that
[1:36:53] wonderful
[1:36:54] and he's already provided all that we
[1:36:58] have to do is walk way that he is laid
[1:37:01] out before let's pray Heavenly Father
[1:37:07] Lord as we just come before you lord

[1:37:16] God as we look Lord upon your word Lord

[1:37:25] Lord that we begin to speak about in
[1:37:28] Jacob's life and seeing that Lord that
[1:37:31] as we've looked at it that the blessing
[1:37:34] belongs to the blessed the Lord it's you

[1:38:36] things that Lord that you've set forth

[1:38:53] his fears were addressed

[1:39:01] we know that that's a type of the Holy
[1:39:03] Ghost in the Church of the Living God
[1:39:06] speaking Lord to our hearts speaking or
[1:39:09] God to our lives Lord and removing Lord

[1:43:56] lady
[1:44:03] me
[1:44:07] and
[1:44:13] [Music]
[1:44:17] I want you to think of this when we
[1:44:20] speak of the submission to the Lord and
[1:44:22] to the presence of God how God would
[1:44:24] bring direction or life it's the Lord
[1:44:26] I just wants you to have complete
[1:44:28] control I may have that desire look at
[1:44:35] what Jacob did he let God have complete
[1:44:38] control by listening to what God was
[1:44:43] saying and then walking in it see God
[1:44:48] can't have complete control if he
[1:44:50] doesn't have complete control
[1:44:55] if God doesn't have control if you say
[1:44:57] Lord I just want you to have control
[1:44:59] we're just standing there and God
[1:45:01] doesn't have control but control is us
[1:45:03] yielding he wants us to cube to you that
[1:45:09] as we yield to him then he takes control
[1:45:13] he's a gentleman
[1:45:15] God will never and you know this you'll
[1:45:17] never tamper and touch any life without
[1:45:21] give being given permission plucky
[1:45:25] little song did brother Jerry sings
[1:45:27] there's a room in my heart where even I
[1:45:28] wouldn't go I had some things in there I
[1:45:30] didn't want no one to know
[1:45:32] but then he handed me the key with look
[1:45:34] of the look of love on his face
[1:45:36] I said I'll make you clean let me in
[1:45:39] your secret place it's letting him have
[1:45:43] control so when the word touches our
[1:45:46] hearts as it does that's letting God
[1:45:48] have control take that word and say Lord
[1:45:52] be it in me Lord be it unto me let thy
[1:45:56] will be done
[1:45:58] in my life and submit to him pray over
[1:46:01] give yourself to it that's letting God
[1:46:03] have control and you'll find like Jacob
[1:46:06] here comes with the goat hair here it
[1:46:08] comes with all these things seem God but
