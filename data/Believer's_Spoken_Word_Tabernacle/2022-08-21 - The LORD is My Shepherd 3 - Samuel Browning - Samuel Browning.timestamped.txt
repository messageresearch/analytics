[39:37] in that way they have the regular Sunday
[39:40] morning service and then we're going to
[39:42] have a Sunday afternoon service for the
[39:44] young people I've contacted the
[39:47] different
[39:48] um the different assemblies around here
[39:51] and just feeling that burden on my heart
[39:53] for a few years now
[39:55] because there's a need
[39:57] for to have that so the Lord willing and
[40:00] when I say young people I know if I have
[40:02] you know I know if I made a statement
[40:04] hey there's going to be ribs for young
[40:06] people here I'm sure there'd be a lot of
[40:08] young people
[40:10] showing up so we want to you know this
[40:13] is the thing
[40:14] you know with with our young people I
[40:16] want to do everything I can not just for
[40:18] our young people but for everybody
[40:20] but the young people deserve a fresh
[40:22] chance for a Revival in their life
[40:25] I have Revival you have Revival

[40:31] I'm going to plug for everything
[40:33] everything along the way Amen to be here
[40:36] to pray and to press on those meetings I
[40:38] I don't ever want to get to a place in
[40:40] my walk or my life to say I don't need
[40:42] no more of that
[40:44] I need more of God
[40:46] I need more of God and I know we feel
[40:48] that way we want to just be a help and
[40:50] you know if you're able to be here I
[40:52] want you to understand it's not just
[40:54] exclusively just for the young people
[40:56] but it will be centered in that way but
[40:58] I know how you know when I've said in
[41:00] youth meetings been Retreat or I've sat
[41:03] there when others are you know
[41:06] ministering with or I'm listening to

[41:15] inspiration and just just coming so God

[41:19] are and so I just want to encourage you
[41:21] in that that's you know

[41:26] invited the different churches that are
[41:29] that are around here uh for that

[41:52] continue to remember her in prayer she's
[41:55] getting stronger day by day and you know
[41:58] she's been getting in and out of the
[42:00] house and walking around and she's just
[42:02] itching to get back here to church and
[42:05] so uh you know she thought for sure that
[42:07] you know she would have been back here
[42:09] already I remember the first day when
[42:11] they were supposed to uh let her out of
[42:14] the hospital
[42:15] she uh they let her out and they sent
[42:17] her to the rehab and you know and just
[42:20] all that and and then they you know let
[42:22] her know hey you're not going to be able
[42:24] to do this man she was disappointed but
[42:26] about that time you know we were talking
[42:28] on the phone I said hey none of this has
[42:30] taken God by surprise
[42:32] right none of it has taken God there's
[42:34] little kinks along the way but we have a
[42:36] sure promise you know we may not know
[42:39] all this but we know God is in control
[42:41] so we want to continue to remember her
[42:43] in prayer and I know you are also um
[42:46] remember continue remember uh brother
[42:48] and sister Monica kobias in prayer that
[42:51] the Lord will just continue to touch and
[42:53] to to strengthen them I just need a real
[42:55] a real touch from the Lord so just ask
[42:58] you to just continue to keep those needs
[42:59] in prayer and other needs here in the
[43:01] assembly let's let's pray for one
[43:03] another
[43:03] amen as one another comes to our hearts
[43:06] says we're a body
[43:07] amen and so at this time I just would
[43:11] like to ask the the parents and children
[43:14] college students and just to come and we
[43:18] want to have prayer and you know we
[43:20] certainly believe in the protection of
[43:21] the Holy Spirit
[43:23] you know when when I was going to
[43:26] college one thing I asked I said God
[43:29] if you just I'm trusting you just to
[43:32] help me to get what I need to get
[43:34] just to be able to get that you know in
[43:36] any way we want his protection and I
[43:39] want you to know as as young people and
[43:42] as
[43:43] that you know when you walk into that
[43:45] school
[43:46] and you walk into that classroom I want
[43:48] you to know
[43:49] that the Lord Jesus is right there with
[43:51] you
[43:52] every day when you you walk in there and
[43:55] maybe you know you don't go to school
[43:58] maybe your home homeschooled or wherever
[44:00] I I what I encourage you to always
[44:03] invite the Lord Jesus
[44:05] you know you just um it'd be like you

[44:09] sometimes you stood around and maybe
[44:11] there's food on the table but nobody's
[44:13] invited you to take some
[44:15] you know it's but that that's something
[44:17] we realized that I didn't even you know
[44:18] sometimes it just slips our mind that I

[44:54] we've got a banner the scripture said
[44:56] that he would be a wall of fire around

[48:00] there's quite a number of you but if you

[48:13] in contact with brother Drake and we'll
[48:15] just kind of we'll go from there
[48:18] that
[48:19] so Psalms 23
[48:21] verse 1.
[48:28] and I know brother Brian he
[48:31] I know that that that's okay that's all
[48:34] right
[48:36] it's
[48:39] if you don't have your Bible I guess you
[48:41] have your phone
[48:45] Psalm of David in Psalms 23 1 the Lord
[48:48] is my shepherd
[48:52] amen I shall not want.
[48:57] he maketh me to lie down in Green
[48:59] Pastures he leadeth me beside the Still
[49:02] Waters
[49:03] and he restoreth my soul
[49:07] he leadeth me in the path of
[49:09] righteousness for his namesake
[49:11] yea though I walk through the valley of
[49:13] the shadow of death I will fear no evil
[49:15] for thou art with me thy rod and thy
[49:19] staff they comfort me
[49:22] thou prepare us a table before me in the
[49:26] presence of mine enemies thou anoint us
[49:29] my head with oil and my cup runneth over
[49:32] surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[49:35] me all the days of my life
[49:37] I will dwell in the house of the Lord
[49:41] forever
[49:43] amen may God bless you as you're being
[49:45] seated
[49:48] I want to read this
[49:51] this quote to you
[49:53] out of Satan's Eden and I want to
[49:57] just draw your attention to there in
[50:00] Psalms 23.
[50:01] and perhaps you've noticed that and
[50:04] you've seen that already but
[50:06] in every one of those of scriptures I
[50:10] want you to notice that David is
[50:13] expressing the Lord is my shepherd that
[50:17] God is a personal God
[50:20] there is no other God besides him
[50:25] he's a living being
[50:29] he's not a thought he's a person
[50:33] he's not an idea he's a person
[50:38] and that is something that's so real of
[50:41] the relationship that God has desired
[50:45] and has set forth for our lives and here
[50:47] out of the message Satan's Eden brother
[50:49] Branham would say it in this manner and
[50:51] he would say I heard brother Neville say
[50:55] this morning someone might have been
[50:58] asking him why I didn't preach on the
[51:00] Holy Ghost why I didn't do this now this
[51:03] quote I referred me quote it to you many
[51:05] times but I've always Marvel that found
[51:08] that someone could charge brother Brown
[51:10] and was not preaching on the Holy Ghost
[51:13] but you realize God was setting the
[51:17] understanding of what the Holy Ghost
[51:19] really is
[51:21] so you had a blending in where things
[51:23] were at because the holy ghost coming in
[51:25] this time that bran would call into one
[51:28] place it's the our triumphal Capstone
[51:31] that's coming down upon Our Lives
[51:34] to recognize the Sons and Daughters of
[51:37] God that God has ordained that we would
[51:40] receive that life now he goes on to make
[51:42] this statement he says here it is the
[51:45] Holy Ghost is the action in you it's a
[51:49] life not an emotion not some sort of a
[51:53] fleshly evidence but it is a person
[51:56] Jesus Christ the word of God
[52:00] established in your heart to Quicken
[52:03] every word of this age
[52:07] I want you to catch what he said it's
[52:09] the person of Jesus Christ
[52:11] established in our hearts so it's not
[52:15] one who it's not coming and going but
[52:18] he's taken his rightful position
[52:21] and so he's established in your heart to
[52:24] Quicken every word of this age
[52:28] Lutheran says now watch the Holy Ghost
[52:30] In Action not so much in demonstrations
[52:32] we we believe in all the demonstrations
[52:35] he said but watch him in action not so
[52:37] much in demonstration but in action what
[52:40] it does according to the word
[52:43] now in first Samuel chapter 13 in in
[52:46] verse 8 when we look here in the
[52:49] scriptures I want to just pull from this
[52:51] point
[52:53] and here in verse 8 and the Bible says
[52:56] in first Samuel 13 8 and and and and he
[52:58] tarried seven days according to the set
[53:00] time that Samuel had appointed I'm sorry
[53:03] I know I'm so used to this I didn't even
[53:05] give you time to turn to it
[53:07] but let me let me just let me just speak
[53:09] about it here just for a moment go ahead
[53:11] and turn to first Samuel 13. and as you
[53:13] turn in there here is a situation that
[53:16] Samuel
[53:17] in the under when the time when when
[53:19] Saul was to be anointed that Samuel had
[53:23] told Saul that you're going to go before
[53:27] me to gilgal
[53:29] and I'm going to come there
[53:31] at seven days and we're going to offer
[53:34] burn offerings and sacrifices and Pete
[53:37] all peace offerings and and and and your
[53:39] seven days you're going to tarry until I
[53:41] come to you
[53:42] and then God will show you what to do at
[53:45] that time so there's things that God's
[53:47] going to continue to to open to you what
[53:50] net what he has for you the next step of
[53:52] the journey and so the Bible speaks to
[53:55] us here in first Samuel 13 verse 8 and
[53:58] he carried seven days according to the
[54:00] set time that Samuel had appointed but
[54:03] Samuel came not to gilgal and the people
[54:05] were scattered from him and Saul said
[54:08] bring hither a burnt offering to me and
[54:10] peace offerings and he offered the burnt
[54:12] offering and it came to pass that as
[54:15] soon as he had made an end of offering
[54:17] the burn offering behold Samuel Cain and
[54:21] Saul went out to meet him that he might
[54:22] salute him and Samuel said what hast
[54:26] thou done and Saul said because I saw
[54:29] that the people were scattered from me
[54:32] and that thou came us not within the
[54:34] days appointed and that the Philistines
[54:36] gathered themselves together at mcmash
[54:38] therefore said I the Philistines will
[54:41] come down now upon me to gilgal and I
[54:44] have not made supplication unto the Lord
[54:46] I forced myself therefore and offered a
[54:51] burnt offering
[54:53] now notice these next verses this is
[54:55] where I want to draw from and Samuel
[54:57] said to Saul thou Hast done foolishly
[55:02] thou Hast not kept the Commandment of
[55:05] the Lord thy God which he commanded thee
[55:10] now remember now God's spokesman was
[55:13] Samuel
[55:16] when Samuel had told him go ahead to
[55:20] gilgal and I'm going to be there in
[55:23] seven days
[55:25] this is where it was a need of
[55:28] discernment that this is not Samuel's
[55:31] thoughts or oops Samuel messed up here
[55:35] it was to recognize Samuel was
[55:39] Vindicated by God
[55:42] and what he said was not his own ideas
[55:45] so when we try to look at it or assault
[55:48] try to try to look at it through his own
[55:49] ideas
[55:51] he could start to look around and here
[55:53] we are at day seven but if God has
[55:58] spoken
[55:59] then God will fulfill his word
[56:07] that's certain
[56:10] God has never got impatient one time
[56:15] that's us
[56:17] we battle impatience even after the Holy
[56:21] Ghost has come
[56:23] that's a war of bringing our own lives
[56:28] subject to the word it's something we
[56:31] must do constantly
[56:35] when they went to go remember what Jesus
[56:38] told them go tarry in Jerusalem he let
[56:42] him know go wait now in this day and
[56:45] time where you and I are living we're
[56:47] not waiting on the Holy Ghost to be
[56:49] poured out he's here
[56:51] he's here but it is necessary to wait
[56:55] according to his word and know that what
[56:58] God has spoken through his Prophet which
[57:02] is not a different message but it calls
[57:06] us back to the original message back to
[57:09] the original outpouring of the Holy
[57:11] Ghost that we can have the same results
[57:14] and same assurance
[57:17] you might have been tearing for
[57:20] days maybe weeks or but you're not waste
[57:22] not waiting on God if the real waiting
[57:26] is is us coming to a place to say God
[57:30] let every part of my life be lined up
[57:33] with you
[57:34] and God gives Grace that our lives that
[57:37] here was the word is coming that our
[57:39] lives might be lined to his will
[57:42] I want you to think of this for thou
[57:45] thou Hast not kept the Commandment of
[57:47] the Lord thy God which he commanded thee
[57:49] for now with the Lord have established
[57:52] thy kingdom upon Israel forever but now
[57:57] thy kingdom shall not continue the Lord
[58:00] hath sought him a man after his own
[58:03] heart and the Lord hath commanded him to
[58:06] be Captain over his people because thou
[58:09] has not camped that which the Lord
[58:12] commanded thee
[58:15] remember in the scriptures as it speaks
[58:18] of in the book of Isaiah then
[58:21] even how the young who are strong and
[58:24] full of Viber and vigor but even in this
[58:28] day
[58:29] they would faint
[58:31] because even their natural strength is
[58:34] not enough to withstand this forces of
[58:38] the enemy in this hour
[58:40] it's not enough it said they would faint
[58:43] but it says that they that will wait
[58:46] upon the Lord
[58:49] shall renew their strength
[58:52] and shall Mount up with wings as an
[58:55] eagle
[58:57] if there's ever a time that that
[58:59] scripture would apply it applies in this
[59:02] hour
[59:03] this is the hour where God has granted
[59:07] wings of the Holy Spirit to back us back
[59:11] into the Homeland to back us back into
[59:14] the promises of God we can't get there
[59:16] on our own but God has supplied of his
[59:19] own self in this hour himself that would
[59:22] back us into the promises of God not my
[59:26] strength but his strength
[59:29] amen the very closing scripture in
[59:32] Psalms 27 which is the chapter of the
[59:35] Rapture wait on the Lord and He Shall
[59:39] strengthen thy heart be of good courage
[59:41] and he shall strengthen the heart let me
[59:44] tell you something anytime that you are
[59:46] waiting on the Lord let me tell you how
[59:48] you wait on him you wait on him with
[59:52] complete assurance that what he said he
[59:56] will do and as you're waiting there go
[1:00:00] ahead and start worshiping him and
[1:00:03] thanking him for what he's promised
[1:00:05] because heavens and earth will pass away
[1:00:08] but my word shall never fail amen God
[1:00:13] don't ever have to take back one word
[1:00:15] that he ever said amen what he said he
[1:00:18] will fulfill in his own season it may
[1:00:22] not come according to my mind or my
[1:00:25] thinking or how that I but I do anything
[1:00:27] about that it's about what God God has
[1:00:30] said and let me be faithful in waiting
[1:00:33] and worshiping and confessing that God
[1:00:36] is in control and this is my promise
[1:00:44] we've reflected on some questions here
[1:00:47] over the past weeks who is your king
[1:00:50] aren't we you know are we under the
[1:00:52] headship of the word of God where where
[1:00:55] it's not we're not under the control of
[1:00:58] anybody else but it's the word of God
[1:01:00] that is moving and directing our life
[1:01:03] and and there's a you know there's the
[1:01:05] the submissiveness in our heart that
[1:01:07] when the word says anything there is and
[1:01:10] a man that ushers from our life and are
[1:01:15] we who is who is our leader where are we
[1:01:17] taking our cues from it's very important
[1:01:19] I I know these are reflective questions
[1:01:21] but this is what God had given that you
[1:01:24] and I would look at and I want you to
[1:01:27] think about it in this day that how did
[1:01:29] God told Saul it because Saul had
[1:01:32] disobeyed one commandment to wait upon
[1:01:36] God then God said at your kingdom will
[1:01:39] not be established in other words there
[1:01:41] is not going to be any continuation of
[1:01:44] your kingdom your kingdom itself I would
[1:01:47] have made it sure I would have
[1:01:49] established it I would have made made it
[1:01:51] strong
[1:01:52] that comes back to one thing you know
[1:01:55] when God when he moves into our life
[1:01:57] brother Brown says it like this in the
[1:01:59] Messiah and just give me just a few
[1:02:01] moments to kind of lay this in the
[1:02:03] background brother Brown said you know
[1:02:04] when a man gets saved a light comes into
[1:02:07] him the light comes into him is about
[1:02:09] like this little white button on my
[1:02:12] shirt so it'd be about like that
[1:02:15] comes in like a little white button
[1:02:18] and how that you and I are made up of a
[1:02:20] system of Tabernacles we are we are
[1:02:23] flesh you got five senses to your flesh
[1:02:25] right
[1:02:26] then we have Spirit there's five senses
[1:02:28] to our spirit conscience memory reason
[1:02:30] affection
[1:02:31] but then there's soul
[1:02:34] and the soul is the nature of the spirit
[1:02:38] the soul is what God comes to deal with
[1:02:42] right
[1:02:44] that's what God comes to deal with is
[1:02:46] deal with that life
[1:02:48] now
[1:02:49] within that there's only one way brother
[1:02:53] Brown would put it like this there's
[1:02:54] only one way for God to come into you
[1:02:57] and the Shekinah Glory to come into your
[1:03:00] life and that is it comes through
[1:03:04] self-will
[1:03:06] What What In Our Lives if you say well
[1:03:09] self-will that that's what's got in
[1:03:12] trouble along it's in trouble when it's
[1:03:14] not yielded to God
[1:03:18] because here in the Garden of Gethsemane
[1:03:21] remember the Lord Jesus he said
[1:03:23] nevertheless not
[1:03:24] my will
[1:03:26] thine will be done
[1:03:29] so it's always surrendering of our will
[1:03:31] but now how that God will come in and
[1:03:33] take over in the control tower of our
[1:03:36] life that's the only way brother Brown
[1:03:37] says is through that of self-will but he
[1:03:40] says when a man is born again with the
[1:03:42] spirit of God God Spirit dwells in him
[1:03:44] and he can let that Spirit grow and take
[1:03:48] out all the roots of bitterness and
[1:03:50] press God's way through him again then
[1:03:53] he will come right back to the same
[1:03:55] condition that he was in the Garden of
[1:03:58] Eden he goes on he says now that light
[1:04:01] or that eternal life is the light of God
[1:04:03] that dwells in the man and if he will
[1:04:06] yield to the spirit more he becomes
[1:04:10] unmanned sinner-like and becomes more
[1:04:13] Godlike
[1:04:15] can I repeat that
[1:04:17] if he will yield to the spirit more he
[1:04:21] becomes unmanned sinner-like and becomes
[1:04:25] more Godlike
[1:04:27] now the key here is yielding that that's
[1:04:30] the whole key in serving God
[1:04:33] is yielding to him
[1:04:36] it's not what you or I can do but it's
[1:04:41] yielding to his working
[1:04:45] that's part of the waiting it's yielding
[1:04:48] and it's looking to him and asking God
[1:04:51] this this should be something that that
[1:04:53] we can say in our lives over and over
[1:04:55] and daily Lord let my desires be lined
[1:04:59] up with your desires
[1:05:01] Lord let my ways be your ways
[1:05:07] my thoughts your thoughts let them be
[1:05:09] high Lord because they're higher they're
[1:05:10] greater than mine Lord Lift Me Up Lord
[1:05:13] let me operate in that channel and in
[1:05:16] that realm you know that's the promise
[1:05:17] let this mind be in you as it was in
[1:05:21] Christ Jesus
[1:05:23] that's the promise now notice in James
[1:05:27] chapter one will you turn with me there
[1:05:28] and James won some of these I do want
[1:05:30] you to read with me in James chapter 1
[1:05:32] and verse 21 a familiar uh scripture
[1:05:36] passage here
[1:05:44] now notice in James chapter 1 and verse
[1:05:48] 21
[1:05:49] and James is admonishing and speaking to
[1:05:52] this wherefore lay apart all filthiness
[1:05:56] and superfluity of naughtiness now
[1:05:59] notice
[1:06:01] what James is speaking
[1:06:04] is not a mind over matter
[1:06:07] but the gospel
[1:06:09] every one of them remember uh Peter
[1:06:12] wrote he says that what that we have
[1:06:15] preached that gospel by the Holy Ghost
[1:06:18] sent down from heaven
[1:06:21] and when the Holy Spirit comes and
[1:06:23] ministers the word it does not reveal to
[1:06:27] you that you are some trodden down
[1:06:30] person that oh I can't do anything but
[1:06:33] he lets you know that even the devil
[1:06:36] that's plaguing you or it's a sickness
[1:06:39] or whatever bondage God wants you to
[1:06:42] know you are a son and daughter of God
[1:06:46] in charge
[1:06:47] foreign
[1:06:49] let's put it right down where it belongs
[1:06:52] you don't become a son and daughter of
[1:06:54] God on a certain day
[1:06:56] you were always the Son and Daughter of
[1:06:59] God
[1:06:59] [Applause]
[1:07:00] Galatians 4 he hath sent forth his
[1:07:04] Spirit into our hearts why because we
[1:07:07] are Sons not because we were somebody
[1:07:10] special or my family or that it's the
[1:07:13] grace of almighty God
[1:07:16] that God sucked you and I out God
[1:07:19] brought us to himself
[1:07:21] and so James is letting you and I know
[1:07:23] if you can just take a hold of that this
[1:07:25] morning and say God let that drop down
[1:07:27] to the fifth rib that you have been put
[1:07:29] in charge and when the Holy Spirit is
[1:07:32] here speaking his word and he's
[1:07:34] energizing it and confirming it to your
[1:07:36] life can I say it in this way you can go
[1:07:39] ahead and step out on that word because
[1:07:41] you've got more than a preacher standing
[1:07:43] by your side you got more than a prophet
[1:07:46] standing by your side you've got
[1:07:48] almighty God that's letting you know
[1:07:51] what you are in charge and capable of
[1:07:53] doing you can tell that devil get out of
[1:07:57] here
[1:08:03] wherefore lay apart oh filthiness and
[1:08:07] superfluity of naughtiness and receive
[1:08:10] with meekness
[1:08:12] the engrafted word that inborn that
[1:08:15] implanted word which is able to save
[1:08:17] your souls now with meekness
[1:08:21] you know the Bible said Moses was the
[1:08:23] meekest man of all the Earth
[1:08:26] yet we also know that
[1:08:29] quite a paradox
[1:08:30] because we also know that also it's got
[1:08:33] a little besetting sin there
[1:08:35] is that right
[1:08:36] did you see to be the meekest man in the
[1:08:38] earth what does meekness mean
[1:08:40] meekness Brothers say it mean to be
[1:08:42] simple
[1:08:43] and when you look at the word meek in
[1:08:45] the Scripture it means to give place to
[1:08:48] Moses simply when he came before The
[1:08:52] Burning Bush he gave place to God
[1:08:56] that's real meekness is not arguing with
[1:08:59] God but give place to the word
[1:09:01] just get placed to it you're saying you
[1:09:04] can look at you and I and look we're
[1:09:05] different in our personalities or make
[1:09:07] us but one thing you want to make sure
[1:09:09] is is that your personality your makeup
[1:09:12] is under the control of the Holy Spirit
[1:09:15] because if it's under the control of the
[1:09:17] Holy Spirit there is no more excuses
[1:09:21] well I am this way because of this or
[1:09:23] because of that you've got a greater
[1:09:26] Authority that has authorized you as the
[1:09:29] Son and Daughter of God to recognize the
[1:09:32] devil has no power over me
[1:09:36] [Applause]
[1:09:38] we might as well have church
[1:09:41] receive meekness receive it with
[1:09:43] meekness give place to it I'm going to
[1:09:45] say God I just want to give place to you
[1:09:47] I want to give place to the word I just
[1:09:50] want to give place to it it's not up to
[1:09:52] me to make it work he's the one that
[1:09:54] will work it out all I got to do is give
[1:09:57] place to it
[1:09:58] [Applause]
[1:09:59] [Music]
[1:10:02] because somebody wants to you know you
[1:10:05] know you're going to put maybe you know
[1:10:06] something new in your kitchen or you
[1:10:08] know a new instrument or one I don't
[1:10:10] need to know how to play it but just
[1:10:12] make room for it somebody will play it
[1:10:15] the word of God God will make sure it
[1:10:17] comes out in our life the right way
[1:10:19] verse 22
[1:10:21] but be you doers of the word and not
[1:10:24] hearers only
[1:10:26] deceiving your own selves
[1:10:29] now think of that how a deception
[1:10:32] that is a deception that's not out here
[1:10:34] but it's a deception Within
[1:10:36] because being a hero of it but not a
[1:10:39] doer
[1:10:40] for If any man be a hearer of the word
[1:10:42] and not a doer he is like unto a man
[1:10:45] beholding his natural face in a glass
[1:10:47] for he beholdth himself and goeth his
[1:10:50] way and straightway forgetth what manner
[1:10:53] of man he was now what that word
[1:10:55] straightway forget is he just
[1:10:58] just as quick as it comes it's gone
[1:11:02] it just the Bible is just being just you
[1:11:04] know it's like it's not important
[1:11:06] anything that's important
[1:11:09] we'll put it down on a reminder
[1:11:12] right
[1:11:14] sometimes there have been a lot of
[1:11:16] things I forgot that's important and I
[1:11:18] forgot to put it down on a reminder sure
[1:11:20] everybody else has to right
[1:11:22] sometimes we can look at things how in
[1:11:24] the world you forget this forget that I
[1:11:25] don't know it's but anyhow any thing
[1:11:28] when it comes down to it when God has
[1:11:30] spoken we want to be attentive and give
[1:11:33] place to that word in our life
[1:11:36] not being a forgetful not being a
[1:11:39] forgetful hearer just caring not even
[1:11:41] caring about but we want to give care to
[1:11:44] that word you say what kind of care you
[1:11:45] want to should we give to that word well
[1:11:47] as a child of Abraham when the word came
[1:11:50] to Abraham Abraham said go make a calf
[1:11:53] ready
[1:11:54] Sarah make some make some good old
[1:11:56] cornbread not the yellow stuff get the
[1:11:58] white buttermilk kind make that for him
[1:12:03] get some buttermilk out here too he'll
[1:12:05] get to dip it in
[1:12:06] get that out here and because what is it
[1:12:08] going to do we're going to entertain
[1:12:10] almighty God
[1:12:13] you say entertain him it's not just here
[1:12:16] God has not come to entertain us he
[1:12:18] doesn't come to entertain you he comes
[1:12:21] that we might entertain him and you know
[1:12:23] what happens if you don't entertain him
[1:12:25] he'll go on
[1:12:28] he'll go on
[1:12:30] but whosoever looketh into the perfect
[1:12:32] law of Liberty
[1:12:34] and continueth therein he being not a
[1:12:37] forgetful hearer but a doer of the work
[1:12:39] this man shall be blessed in his deed
[1:12:44] now brother Brown would say it like this
[1:12:46] and spoken words original CDs he's
[1:12:48] speaking of of of of of of of the coming
[1:12:50] of the Holy Spirit and he says now you
[1:12:53] could say brother Brahm I believe every
[1:12:55] word of it he said but don't you back up
[1:12:56] when you get to your tradition you stay
[1:12:59] right with the word and stay with that
[1:13:02] and watch what happens
[1:13:04] oh Lord I believe it now notice what he
[1:13:06] says he said say it this oh Lord I
[1:13:10] believe it send the Holy Spirit
[1:13:15] then watch then if he goes to bearing
[1:13:19] record then you know you got it not by
[1:13:22] some sensation the Devils do that not by
[1:13:25] some miracle the Devils do that but by
[1:13:28] your constant belief in the word of God
[1:13:31] and the life that you live never deny
[1:13:35] nothing that makes the word notice that
[1:13:38] makes the word becoming flesh
[1:13:41] flesh in you
[1:13:46] now Saul we read here Saul had an
[1:13:48] opportunity to be established by God
[1:13:52] and you know the is to be established by
[1:13:56] God
[1:13:56] it comes
[1:13:58] by buying through obedience to the word
[1:14:01] of God that we are established and
[1:14:04] recognized as a Believer you see when
[1:14:07] God has said something
[1:14:09] in his word that he will establish
[1:14:12] something
[1:14:14] what God is letting it be known that I
[1:14:17] will make that sure I will make it
[1:14:21] positive I I will make it a positive
[1:14:24] reality to you
[1:14:26] now think of this in the scripture you
[1:14:29] can read of this you know of the how the
[1:14:31] Bible would record of how that God has
[1:14:34] created the heavens and he formed the
[1:14:36] Earth and made it and he established it
[1:14:39] in Jeremiah 51 15 said he hath made the
[1:14:43] Earth by his power he hath established
[1:14:47] the World by his wisdom and has
[1:14:50] stretched out the Heaven by his
[1:14:53] understanding so God has established
[1:14:57] every Star the Sun the moon God has
[1:15:01] established everything remember that was
[1:15:04] his first Bible and God has established
[1:15:07] it you know they give out voices
[1:15:09] they they they they they they they say
[1:15:12] the same thing you know they never said
[1:15:14] anything differently they still say the
[1:15:16] same thing so when God establishes
[1:15:19] anything it is something that is sure it
[1:15:23] is something that that is steadfast it
[1:15:25] is something that is absolutely
[1:15:27] unmovable
[1:15:29] if you or I try to make something we can
[1:15:32] make something as sure as we think we
[1:15:35] can make it they did that to the tomb of
[1:15:38] where the Lord Jesus was buried they
[1:15:41] made it as sure this is a scripture as
[1:15:43] they possibly could and as sure as man
[1:15:47] could make that God showed that there is
[1:15:51] nothing sure in man but the word of God
[1:15:55] is more sure than any word of a man
[1:15:59] all right
[1:16:00] and God loosened that hole that was upon
[1:16:04] that tomb so when God has said something
[1:16:06] he will stand behind it
[1:16:09] in the Bible when John Jehoshaphat one
[1:16:11] of the places in the scripture when
[1:16:13] Israel was going out to battle and here
[1:16:15] they were in front of the enemy here's a
[1:16:18] testimony of the of the Holy Spirit
[1:16:20] coming through in that hour believe in
[1:16:23] the Lord your God and so shall you be
[1:16:27] established believe His prophets so
[1:16:30] shall ye prosper
[1:16:33] now if you go with me to the Book of
[1:16:36] Romans
[1:16:37] and I want to just look in here just a
[1:16:39] moment
[1:16:40] and as you're turning there
[1:16:42] the Bible when you look at the
[1:16:45] establishment and how God would
[1:16:48] establish things the Bible said that all
[1:16:50] Israel knew
[1:16:51] from Dan to Beersheba that Samuel was
[1:16:55] established to be a prophet of the Lord
[1:17:00] there was no question in that
[1:17:02] he was established not by man he was
[1:17:06] established by God
[1:17:08] you know he he was there and Eli was
[1:17:11] there but it wasn't Eli that established
[1:17:13] him
[1:17:14] Eli gave him good advice at first where
[1:17:16] Eli said and perceived it was God
[1:17:19] speaking to him as a little boy he had
[1:17:21] only 20 months he says is just when you
[1:17:23] hear his voice again just present
[1:17:26] yourself and say here I am oh my oh God
[1:17:30] help us to be little children in that
[1:17:33] way
[1:17:33] we want to be we want to be you know
[1:17:36] understanding but God help us to be
[1:17:39] children in that we steal can hear his
[1:17:41] voice and present ourselves before him
[1:17:44] and say Here I Am Lord you've called
[1:17:46] you've spoken Lord say on your servant
[1:17:49] is here
[1:17:51] Samuel was established to be a prophet
[1:17:53] of God now notice in Romans chapter 1 in
[1:17:55] verse 11 remember how Paul was wanting
[1:17:58] and Desiring to go to bed of Rome you
[1:18:01] see it was a burden of the Lord to take
[1:18:03] this gospel because God had made himself
[1:18:06] known to Paul and it was Paul according
[1:18:09] to God's working in his life that there
[1:18:11] was a desire that was not a man-made
[1:18:14] desire it was a desire of almighty God
[1:18:17] an achievement that God had before the
[1:18:20] foundation of the world there were
[1:18:21] hearts and lives to be reached by the
[1:18:24] gospel and Paul could say in verse 11 of
[1:18:26] Romans chapter 1 for I long to see you
[1:18:29] that I may impart unto you some
[1:18:33] spiritual gift to the end ye may be
[1:18:36] established now anyone talking about
[1:18:39] tongues we believe in tongues he wasn't
[1:18:41] talking about interpretation he's
[1:18:43] talking about the Unspeakable gift and
[1:18:46] that is the Holy Ghost I desired that I
[1:18:50] might impart some spiritual gift to you
[1:18:52] that you might be established because
[1:18:54] that is the only that is the true gift
[1:18:58] of almighty God that will establish you
[1:19:00] and I it sets us firm within the word of
[1:19:04] God because after all Paul's desire was
[1:19:07] is he said is that when I've come among
[1:19:09] you it's not with enticing words of
[1:19:12] man's Wisdom in other words I'm not calm
[1:19:14] among you that you would look to me for
[1:19:17] anything but I have come among you under
[1:19:19] the burden and desire of almighty God
[1:19:22] that your faith would stand and rest in
[1:19:25] the power of God
[1:19:27] what a burden to operate by now notice
[1:19:30] in Romans 16 if you want to turn over
[1:19:31] there just for a moment and I'll then
[1:19:33] after that I'll just refer to a few
[1:19:35] other places in the scripture but in
[1:19:37] Romans chapter 16 I I love this
[1:19:39] scripture the chapter before Paul has
[1:19:42] just set forth as a reminder of the
[1:19:45] authority that God has given to him as a
[1:19:47] minister to the Gentiles
[1:19:49] oh my notice in Romans 16 25 now to him
[1:19:55] that is of power to establish you oh
[1:19:59] glory be to God aren't you glad that
[1:20:03] there is the power not just a power but
[1:20:06] the power of the Living God that's able
[1:20:09] to establish you and I
[1:20:11] that which is able to make firm and to
[1:20:14] make sure we're we're not hoping we're
[1:20:16] not wondering but it makes sure it
[1:20:19] establishes us in Christ
[1:20:21] according to my gospel in the preaching
[1:20:24] of Jesus Christ according to the
[1:20:26] Revelation notice now according to my
[1:20:28] gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ
[1:20:30] according to the revelation of the
[1:20:32] mystery which was Kept Secret since the
[1:20:35] world began but now is made manifest so
[1:20:40] what was sealed up is now made manifest
[1:20:43] and by the scriptures of the prophets
[1:20:46] according to the Commandment of the
[1:20:48] Everlasting God made known to All
[1:20:50] Nations for The Obedience of Faith to
[1:20:52] God only wives be glory through Jesus
[1:20:55] Christ forever
[1:20:57] now Paul would go on even in a few
[1:21:01] places I'd just referred to you don't
[1:21:02] have to turn there but he would speak to
[1:21:04] the the Ephesians and remember he would
[1:21:07] let him know of of the grace what has
[1:21:10] come to them you see he would let he
[1:21:12] would let him know in Ephesus you are
[1:21:14] you are called to be Saints now remember
[1:21:16] these people in Ephesus had received
[1:21:19] there you know there had there had been
[1:21:21] an outpouring of of the Holy Spirit
[1:21:24] there in Ephesus that had brought them
[1:21:26] in to the body of Jesus Christ now as
[1:21:29] Paul is standing there he's praying and
[1:21:32] he says I've been praying that God would
[1:21:35] strengthen you so there's evidently
[1:21:36] there's lives that needed to go on into
[1:21:40] establishment now just stay with me a
[1:21:42] minute and Paul was praying and asking
[1:21:44] and knowing that it is God that will
[1:21:46] strengthen you in your inner man that
[1:21:49] you might be rooted and grounded in
[1:21:53] faith
[1:21:55] I don't know about you you know when you
[1:21:57] uh you get ready to plant something and
[1:21:59] you you know your things that you you
[1:22:01] you get into and you plant many times
[1:22:04] you plant a tree a shrub or whatever
[1:22:05] more you know about the first year
[1:22:07] sometimes the first two years you've got
[1:22:09] to water that thing
[1:22:11] every every three you know every three
[1:22:13] days if you got hydrangeas you know
[1:22:15] hydraneous if they'll let you know you
[1:22:17] might try to wait three days but they'll
[1:22:18] let you know by their leaves you know
[1:22:20] them big beautiful bushes with the white
[1:22:21] flowers or whatever you call them or
[1:22:23] whatever more but you know the thing of
[1:22:25] it is they have to come into a place of
[1:22:28] get established you talk to any Nursery
[1:22:29] landscape or whatever more and they tell
[1:22:31] you they must get established now in
[1:22:34] order to get established there's got to
[1:22:36] be rain that would water them in well
[1:22:39] what's the whole purpose of that until
[1:22:41] they eventually tap in to the source of
[1:22:44] water that is beneath the ground that
[1:22:48] you or I can't see where they're not
[1:22:49] just waiting on a rain to come by but
[1:22:52] they've got tapped in and they are
[1:22:54] established no matter what storm comes
[1:22:56] no matter what comes their way they have
[1:22:59] now become rooted and established and
[1:23:02] built up
[1:23:03] yeah
[1:23:05] and this is where Paul has has said that
[1:23:08] my prayer is that the spirit of God
[1:23:10] would strengthen you in the inner man
[1:23:13] that you would be rooted and grounded in
[1:23:16] love
[1:23:17] second Corinthians chapter 1 verse 21
[1:23:19] now he who establishes us with you in
[1:23:23] Christ and hath anointed us as God who
[1:23:26] also has sealed us and given us the
[1:23:28] earnest of the spirit in our hearts in
[1:23:31] Colossians 2 Verse 6 he says as ye have
[1:23:33] therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord
[1:23:35] so walk ye in him everybody say walk
[1:23:39] walk rooted now this is the way you walk
[1:23:42] rooted and built up in him so there is a
[1:23:47] strengthening of the holy spirit that
[1:23:49] comes into our life bringing us from
[1:23:52] death unto life that Roots us and
[1:23:54] grounds us in Christ and then through
[1:23:57] that rooting and grounding we are
[1:23:59] continually rooted and grounded you know
[1:24:02] your roots can't stop growing
[1:24:05] if your roots stop growing you're in
[1:24:07] trouble
[1:24:09] right Roots you say how do the roots
[1:24:12] grow roots are seeking for moisture
[1:24:16] roots are not thinking I'm gonna have to
[1:24:19] get out here to hold this plant in place
[1:24:20] the roots go to the water and by them
[1:24:24] going to the source of water it causes
[1:24:27] them to get a greater hold there within
[1:24:31] the Earth that when the storms come
[1:24:33] they're able to stand there oh Glory
[1:24:35] that's the same way it is with you and I
[1:24:38] this is why seeking after God and asking
[1:24:42] God let the roots go deeper let my walk
[1:24:45] go deeper let my life go deeper Lord let
[1:24:48] me have more of the Holy Ghost let me
[1:24:50] have every feeling of the Holy Ghost
[1:24:52] Lord what is it it's growing deeper
[1:24:58] glory be to God
[1:25:00] rooted and built up in him and
[1:25:02] established in the faith as you have
[1:25:04] been taught abounding abounding
[1:25:05] abounding therein with Thanksgiving
[1:25:08] and in the urgency of the moment we're
[1:25:10] living in in James 5 8.
[1:25:12] be also patient that means steadfast in
[1:25:16] waiting
[1:25:17] with an assurance an enduring
[1:25:19] Assurance be you also patient establish
[1:25:23] your hearts
[1:25:25] now notice what it says establish your
[1:25:28] hearts
[1:25:28] how do we establish our hearts that
[1:25:31] means we have access to that which is
[1:25:35] able to establish us
[1:25:38] Hallelujah to establish our hearts why
[1:25:41] because the coming of the Lord draweth
[1:25:44] nigh
[1:25:47] now let me just say it like this so
[1:25:50] as we were looking at that that
[1:25:52] statement where brother Barnabas looked
[1:25:55] at
[1:25:55] where the Holy Ghost is the person of
[1:25:58] Jesus Christ established in our heart
[1:26:03] quickening every word of this age to our
[1:26:07] life in other words making it alive to
[1:26:09] us and Us Alive to it
[1:26:12] so it's not just something we know
[1:26:15] is what we are yielded to
[1:26:18] and what God operates through us
[1:26:21] now let me tell you just as much
[1:26:23] as God's desire because Satan's a
[1:26:26] copycat
[1:26:28] right that's what he does he just copies
[1:26:31] the things
[1:26:32] that what God
[1:26:34] what God does
[1:26:36] and Satan's attempt intent is to
[1:26:40] establish himself
[1:26:43] the Bible makes that clear in second
[1:26:44] second Thessalonians chapter 2.
[1:26:47] and it speaks of
[1:26:49] the one that that false prophet
[1:26:54] that Beast
[1:26:56] even him who's coming is after Satan so
[1:26:59] notice Paul is saying that the way he's
[1:27:02] coming is after Satan so by the
[1:27:06] characteristics the way his approach is
[1:27:09] you're able to know that Satan let me
[1:27:12] preach where I'm on it
[1:27:14] do you realize that when Israel saw
[1:27:17] uh the king and this King it was a king
[1:27:21] of the children I believe the Iman I
[1:27:24] can't remember the name uh exactly but
[1:27:25] when they saw that King remember his
[1:27:28] name was nayash the king and they saw
[1:27:32] him when he came out his word his name
[1:27:34] nahash means servant
[1:27:37] and when they saw serpent King that put
[1:27:41] in their hearts we need a king
[1:27:43] and it was in that same verse of
[1:27:46] scripture that that serpent said I'm
[1:27:49] gonna put out your right eyes if you
[1:27:51] don't surrender
[1:27:53] little did Israel know that by giving
[1:27:56] heed to the serpent just looking upon
[1:27:59] Him by standing still for just a minute
[1:28:03] where did he fail when she stopped to
[1:28:07] listen
[1:28:10] when she stopped to listen
[1:28:13] remember brother random takes an example
[1:28:14] of a young lady who's been delivered
[1:28:18] she was a Dancehall Queen
[1:28:20] and she went over there and she come
[1:28:22] around there and she got around that
[1:28:24] dancehall and she said well yeah oh I
[1:28:26] remember me and Leah boy you know that
[1:28:28] that musical It really used to get me it
[1:28:31] don't bother me no more brother bam said
[1:28:32] aha you only think it don't
[1:28:37] she got over there around it and she
[1:28:39] started thinking let me tell you you
[1:28:41] know why she started thinking and
[1:28:42] calling back all those things where her
[1:28:44] and Lee that man they want all those
[1:28:46] different conferences or championships
[1:28:49] or dance dance offs you know why she got
[1:28:51] the thinking on it because she got under
[1:28:53] an atmosphere that started to deal with
[1:28:56] her painting I'm telling you you got to
[1:28:58] be careful where you go the things you
[1:29:01] entertain because there are atmospheres
[1:29:04] and spirits and remember every word is
[1:29:07] there is a spirit being carried with it
[1:29:14] she started reminiscing before long
[1:29:17] she was on the dance floor in the arms
[1:29:19] of a man
[1:29:22] all because
[1:29:23] have got this
[1:29:25] I've got this I don't think this is
[1:29:27] where atmosphere and influences take
[1:29:30] hold and remember it was a spirit
[1:29:33] brother random didn't just talk to her
[1:29:35] when she came there and knocked on his
[1:29:37] door remember what it was when he prayed
[1:29:40] there was a spirit that came out of her
[1:29:43] that was of a bat with long hairs
[1:29:46] remember the man who was drunk he
[1:29:47] sobered up real quick
[1:29:49] right what was it it was an evil spirit
[1:29:55] that she gave heed to listen to me are
[1:29:58] you telling us that we ought to be
[1:29:59] afraid but what I'm trying to tell you
[1:30:01] is is you know things that you should
[1:30:04] not be entangled with and Tangled Up
[1:30:07] with the Bible stands Stand Fast in the
[1:30:10] Liberty where with Christ has made us
[1:30:13] free and be not entangled again with the
[1:30:17] Yoke of bondage
[1:30:19] sometimes I know we take the scriptures
[1:30:21] and I believe the quote that the bride
[1:30:23] is an invincible Army
[1:30:25] but I don't believe that it just makes
[1:30:27] us nonchalant
[1:30:29] well I don't have to worry about nothing
[1:30:32] I've got it on to control no when you
[1:30:34] meet him you realize he's what I need
[1:30:37] the Lord is my shepherd
[1:30:41] daily Moment by moment
[1:30:45] he knows where I need to be feeding he
[1:30:48] will direct me to Green Pastures and he
[1:30:51] will bring me by Still Waters to let me
[1:30:55] see myself in the reflection of the word
[1:30:58] and remind me of who I am and strengthen
[1:31:02] me
[1:31:06] so Satan's desire is to establish
[1:31:09] himself
[1:31:11] in the hearts and the way that he did
[1:31:13] this Brethren would pick this up in
[1:31:15] Satan's Eden in that same message and
[1:31:17] say the way that he did he came among
[1:31:19] those rabbis and Pharisees and different
[1:31:22] ones and he told them now the scripture
[1:31:24] that he's talking about of the promise
[1:31:27] and the Fulfillment of Isaiah 9 6 and on
[1:31:30] and on all those scriptures that was
[1:31:31] spoken Messiah Satan told those rabbis
[1:31:34] and Jews now that's absolutely the word
[1:31:36] it's absolutely the truth but this man
[1:31:38] ain't the man
[1:31:43] so he then couldn't tell them rabbis and
[1:31:45] Pharisees that it's not the word
[1:31:49] but what he told him was
[1:31:51] this ain't him
[1:31:55] but you see God always will identify
[1:31:59] himself
[1:32:00] by his same characteristics
[1:32:03] and if you'll notice how the Lord Jesus
[1:32:05] approached it
[1:32:07] the Lord Jesus is not a god of force
[1:32:10] Satan is the god of force
[1:32:14] God don't God hadn't forced himself on
[1:32:16] nobody God Don't Force you and I to
[1:32:19] believe God didn't force them no think
[1:32:21] of this after the resurrection of the
[1:32:24] Lord Jesus the Lord Jesus never said
[1:32:26] where is pilate that old unbeliever and
[1:32:30] the rest of them right now I'm gonna go
[1:32:32] prove to them exactly
[1:32:35] guess what it had done no good
[1:32:40] but who he raised for
[1:32:43] he came and found
[1:32:45] he didn't go back up there they didn't
[1:32:47] believe him the rabbis didn't believe
[1:32:49] him he didn't go up there and try to say
[1:32:51] now let me prove this to you this and
[1:32:53] that it was not approving time for them
[1:32:56] he was proving his word to whom I to his
[1:33:00] believing children
[1:33:03] and there were Believers that were
[1:33:05] gathered there in that hour of the
[1:33:07] resurrection and that word and events
[1:33:10] that they could not understand and
[1:33:12] little things they were seeing here or
[1:33:14] there but now when he comes and makes
[1:33:16] known that I am he that was dead and I'm
[1:33:20] Alive forevermore it stirs something up
[1:33:23] inside of them what is it it's the chief
[1:33:26] Shepherd that is coming to call his
[1:33:29] sheep
[1:33:31] foreign
[1:33:33] remember to establish himself and
[1:33:36] brother Brian would say it like this
[1:33:38] in that same line of thought
[1:33:40] he said you know
[1:33:42] you know Satan has worked
[1:33:44] you know to establish this deception
[1:33:47] through Ministry
[1:33:49] right the Bible says Satan has ministers
[1:33:53] right false workers
[1:33:55] they're not lazy people they work
[1:33:57] false apostles
[1:33:59] right ministers
[1:34:02] of light
[1:34:04] transforming themselves into Ministers
[1:34:07] of life this is more understanding
[1:34:10] let me tell you something any more
[1:34:13] understanding that don't require
[1:34:15] something out of your life ain't of God
[1:34:20] because every understanding that comes
[1:34:24] from God is going to require you and I
[1:34:27] to die to ourself
[1:34:31] that's why real Revelation is not head
[1:34:34] knowledge real Revelation is the
[1:34:36] impartation of the spirit of God it
[1:34:39] moves down into our life you can't even
[1:34:41] explain it brother said here you are
[1:34:43] under the preaching of the word and he
[1:34:45] said something begins to drop out of
[1:34:48] Eternity and it begins to come down and
[1:34:50] he said here it drops into your life and
[1:34:53] he said here where you were down you
[1:34:55] feel strong and where you were sad you
[1:34:57] feel happy he said your strength and why
[1:34:59] you have received a visitation from The
[1:35:03] Unseen realm I'm telling you God knows
[1:35:06] your address and he drops Revelation
[1:35:09] just as we have need of it
[1:35:13] Hallelujah and Satan's desire to try to
[1:35:17] establish himself
[1:35:23] that's why we stand I said we we stand
[1:35:27] against every opposing spirit
[1:35:30] we stand against every tradition if it's
[1:35:32] our own tradition
[1:35:34] if it's our own families thought about
[1:35:36] her her own Trinity we stand against
[1:35:38] everything that's against God
[1:35:40] [Applause]
[1:35:40] [Music]
[1:35:42] Hallelujah
[1:35:44] We're not gonna let the enemy establish
[1:35:47] or well I believe it this far we'll do
[1:35:49] this but we believe God and we know that
[1:35:53] God's desire is to so fully establish
[1:35:55] himself in our lives
[1:35:58] Hallelujah this is why the word must be
[1:36:02] established
[1:36:03] now think about this brother Brown would
[1:36:06] say it like this he said in the
[1:36:07] establishing of that word you got to
[1:36:09] take out all the unbelief
[1:36:12] and establish the kingdom of God in a
[1:36:14] man's heart now it's not just all the
[1:36:16] attributes of sin all those got to be
[1:36:18] gone
[1:36:19] right well we just read and lay apart
[1:36:22] all that
[1:36:24] and the unbelief you see what what
[1:36:26] allows and an attribute of sin to remain
[1:36:31] to remain as a threat of authority
[1:36:34] because of the unbelief that's there
[1:36:36] sometimes we're looking to the wrong
[1:36:38] Source instead of looking to he is the
[1:36:42] source of my life
[1:36:44] he is my delivery he is my savior he is
[1:36:49] my strength he is my conqueror I'm
[1:36:51] talking about him you are not being
[1:36:54] identified or introduced to an idea an
[1:36:57] idea can go home with you but the person
[1:37:00] of Jesus Christ will lead you he'll
[1:37:04] guide you he Shepherds your life
[1:37:07] yeah
[1:37:09] so all the beliefs got to be taken out
[1:37:11] so that the kingdom can be established
[1:37:14] in our heart
[1:37:16] oh my
[1:37:18] now think of it in this manner
[1:37:21] God through Paul
[1:37:23] would also let us know you've been
[1:37:25] chosen
[1:37:28] and upon this is the kind of Truth and
[1:37:30] Paul said but God from the beginning
[1:37:32] chosen you to Salvation through
[1:37:35] sanctification of the spirit and belief
[1:37:37] of the truth you didn't choose yourself
[1:37:41] God chose you let me tell you this way
[1:37:44] is new to you but God has chosen you to
[1:37:48] Walk This Way
[1:37:51] and his choosing is greater than your
[1:37:55] will
[1:37:56] because even before you fully surrender
[1:37:59] it's the choosing of God that's breaking
[1:38:02] over your life by the quickening power
[1:38:05] that's coming to lead you and guide you
[1:38:08] what is it it's God coming to fulfill
[1:38:12] his word as he said he would do it
[1:38:16] the Lord is my shepherd
[1:38:21] he called you by our gospel Paul said to
[1:38:25] the obtaining of the glory of our Lord
[1:38:27] Jesus Christ
[1:38:30] now let me just
[1:38:31] throw down here just a moment
[1:38:34] but the RAM takes us in the adoption
[1:38:35] series
[1:38:37] now remember he's just come from Beyond
[1:38:39] the curtain of time and here he is he's
[1:38:42] preached rejected King he's dealing with
[1:38:45] this what has come to reign
[1:38:47] over
[1:38:49] the church world
[1:38:50] what is already there you know even the
[1:38:52] reality of Pentecost
[1:38:56] yeah I'm talking about Pentecostal
[1:38:58] organization not panic because real
[1:38:59] Pentecost is God that's simple Pentecost
[1:39:03] is God
[1:39:06] Hallelujah
[1:39:08] oh glory be to God now know that brother
[1:39:10] said like this he said God took you into
[1:39:12] the body of Christ after you proved
[1:39:14] yourself
[1:39:15] Sanctified yourself with your good
[1:39:17] behavior and obedience to the Holy
[1:39:20] Spirit no matter what the world says
[1:39:22] so see God takes you after there has
[1:39:26] been a sanctifying of your life
[1:39:29] whether that takes us in the future home
[1:39:30] it was sanctifying is even where you're
[1:39:33] thinking that has changed toward the
[1:39:36] things of the world
[1:39:38] there there is that you you do not you
[1:39:40] Lord I don't want to do those things
[1:39:42] that are wrong I don't want to do those
[1:39:43] things or please you see what is it it's
[1:39:45] more of the same holy ghost that has
[1:39:49] brought conviction upon your life to
[1:39:51] repent of your sins and be baptized in
[1:39:55] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:39:57] more of the Holy Ghost has come to your
[1:39:59] life now remember he don't strip it out
[1:40:02] of you and I but he comes to present
[1:40:04] himself in revealing that I am your
[1:40:08] sanctifier and it's up to you and I to
[1:40:10] give place to the word in our life
[1:40:13] is that right now notice he said you've
[1:40:16] come into the body of Christ after
[1:40:17] you've Sanctified yourself with your
[1:40:19] good behavior and obedience to the Holy
[1:40:21] Spirit can I pause here just for a
[1:40:22] moment thank you I will
[1:40:25] but many times when we're looking at you
[1:40:26] know and even when a life can start out
[1:40:28] in serving God they've repented
[1:40:31] I trust you have
[1:40:32] because if you're not repented that's
[1:40:34] ground one
[1:40:35] well I come to church all my life that
[1:40:37] ain't repentance
[1:40:39] no more than a dog going to the same dog
[1:40:41] house he's always been in
[1:40:42] repentance is where you're convicted
[1:40:45] that I'm wrong
[1:40:46] [Music]
[1:40:48] I need the Lord Jesus Christ as my
[1:40:51] savior
[1:40:53] this is not a Reformation we're not
[1:40:56] trying to reform people
[1:40:59] that's not what the gospel is well I'm
[1:41:01] going to make you a better person got
[1:41:03] that not the gospel
[1:41:05] remember him who has the power to
[1:41:07] establish you the power to make your
[1:41:10] walk steadfast and and firm in him
[1:41:16] that same God comes
[1:41:18] and where's things that you can know in
[1:41:22] your life and you say I'm not going to
[1:41:23] do this let me say I'm not going to wear
[1:41:25] pants no more because that's not
[1:41:27] according to the word of God let me tell
[1:41:30] you something when you're praying and
[1:41:31] you're asking God Lord take that desire
[1:41:33] out of my life
[1:41:36] come on as it's coming take it out of my
[1:41:38] life God don't want you looking at
[1:41:41] something and saying well I have to do
[1:41:42] this and I have to do that it's God's
[1:41:45] word
[1:41:46] the Bible said that the women are to
[1:41:48] dress in modesty that means free flowing
[1:41:51] garments
[1:41:53] thank you
[1:41:54] well that ain't how this church teaches
[1:41:57] that I can't help how any other Church
[1:41:59] teaches it but there is one king that we
[1:42:02] have and that's the king of the Lord
[1:42:04] Jesus Christ and if he won't keep that
[1:42:07] word and stand on that word then how can
[1:42:09] we have taken away from his word
[1:42:12] man has done that under the inspiration
[1:42:15] of Satan
[1:42:17] doctrines of devils
[1:42:20] Satan don't care how religious you are
[1:42:24] as long as you don't get the life
[1:42:29] I know there's a lot more than just
[1:42:30] wearing pants and everything else but
[1:42:33] there's a lot more in the Holy Spirit
[1:42:34] brings us to that reminder and to those
[1:42:36] attentions of those things even within
[1:42:38] our life but notice I want you to hear
[1:42:40] about this but of them said you know he
[1:42:41] said what I'm going to rub it real hard
[1:42:43] he said but I don't mean to be rude but
[1:42:46] he said don't don't I don't want you to
[1:42:47] you're really going to think I'm mean
[1:42:49] but I don't want to be but he said what
[1:42:51] worries me
[1:42:52] is to take people and preach to them
[1:42:55] this God sent truth and they'll turn
[1:42:57] right back around and just keep on doing
[1:42:59] the same thing
[1:43:01] and say they got the Holy Ghost
[1:43:06] he said that just nearly ruins you
[1:43:09] that can't be friends
[1:43:11] you can't keep doing the same things and
[1:43:13] claim you've got the Holy Ghost
[1:43:16] the whole let me tell you something the
[1:43:17] Holy Ghost will never leave you bound
[1:43:20] when the Holy Ghost has come into your
[1:43:22] life I'm talking about with the baptism
[1:43:24] of the Holy Ghost where there's a change
[1:43:25] that comes on the inside of your life
[1:43:27] not just a sensation not just a feeling
[1:43:31] but the real person of Jesus Christ you
[1:43:35] now are under new ownership
[1:43:39] well brother Samuel I'm still bound the
[1:43:41] Holy Ghost brings liberation
[1:43:44] oh we're getting quiet now
[1:43:47] but he sets us free
[1:43:50] are you hearing me now and there can be
[1:43:53] traps but I think we need to be careful
[1:43:54] what we're calling a trap might actually
[1:43:57] be bondage
[1:44:04] but we have an answer
[1:44:07] I say we got an answer
[1:44:09] don't you ever let Satan diminish that
[1:44:11] answer
[1:44:13] that answer is Jesus Christ is the same
[1:44:15] yesterday today and forever
[1:44:19] is that all right because you see when
[1:44:22] God has come let's look at the scripture
[1:44:24] Romans 8 chapter uh Romans 8 chapter
[1:44:27] verse 10 if Christ be in you the body is
[1:44:30] dead because of sin but the spirit is
[1:44:33] life because of righteousness but if the
[1:44:36] spirit of him that raised up Jesus from
[1:44:38] the dead dwell in you he then raised up
[1:44:41] Christ from the dead shall also Quicken
[1:44:43] your mortal bodies by his spirit that
[1:44:46] dwelleth in you
[1:44:48] a brother random he he gives the example
[1:44:50] and we're talking and thinking about
[1:44:53] how God the power to establish us
[1:44:56] and that of God coming to establish and
[1:44:59] move in our life
[1:45:01] I believe with all my heart I believe
[1:45:03] you would agree with me God's desire is
[1:45:05] that every one of our lives would be
[1:45:07] established and we would continue to
[1:45:09] grow in him
[1:45:12] that's God's desire
[1:45:14] there is there you know let me just let
[1:45:16] me just bring this example brother
[1:45:18] Branham when he's he's looking at the
[1:45:20] quickening power of God which is the
[1:45:23] Holy Ghost and how that Paul had right
[1:45:25] here if if that same spirit that raised
[1:45:28] up
[1:45:29] Jesus from the dead dwell in you it
[1:45:32] shall also Quicken your mortal body in
[1:45:34] other words that life inside of you like
[1:45:36] we read the quote at the beginning his
[1:45:38] life inside of you it quickens you to
[1:45:42] the word in other words makes it alive
[1:45:45] it's not you or not me performing the
[1:45:48] word it's Christ operating through a
[1:45:52] love affair
[1:45:55] it doesn't mean that I'm well let me
[1:45:57] just get in this quote
[1:45:59] because I'll get to my punch line later
[1:46:01] here in a minute
[1:46:02] but you see brother bam says here's an
[1:46:04] Evidence
[1:46:05] of whether you have it or not talking
[1:46:07] about the Holy Ghost he said if that
[1:46:09] Spirit was in Christ is in you it'll
[1:46:11] Quicken you to the word now remember he
[1:46:13] quickens us to the word we can be around
[1:46:14] the word but not quickened to it
[1:46:17] right the disciples were around it they
[1:46:19] believed it right he proved hey what
[1:46:22] what Zechariah said this happened that
[1:46:24] the shepherd had been smitten and you
[1:46:26] were scattered all those things he began
[1:46:28] to prove to them the scriptures they
[1:46:30] were around it the whole time but now
[1:46:32] came time for their lives to be
[1:46:35] quickened because you know why they
[1:46:37] would not be able to make or to live out
[1:46:40] that testimony of Jesus Christ which is
[1:46:43] the spirit of Prophecy which is the
[1:46:45] identification of the Resurrection
[1:46:49] unless they were quickened by the same
[1:46:53] quickening power
[1:46:56] Hallelujah now think of it brother
[1:46:58] Graham said Jesus himself being a man
[1:47:02] he said he had to receive that
[1:47:04] quickening power in order to Quicken the
[1:47:07] promises unto him let me pick that up in
[1:47:09] a minute
[1:47:10] so it must be the quickening power that
[1:47:13] would come upon our life now brother
[1:47:15] look at this very close example he said
[1:47:18] if if the spirit that that comes upon
[1:47:21] you if it quickens you away from the
[1:47:24] word then it isn't the spirit of Christ
[1:47:27] now I want you to think of what he just
[1:47:29] said here because he says until that
[1:47:31] moves you in the word
[1:47:34] my sheep hear my voice and they shall
[1:47:37] live by every word of God you see when
[1:47:39] the quickening powers come now brother
[1:47:40] Ram talks about this example how many
[1:47:42] remember the dream he talks about that
[1:47:43] his mama had of the woman wearing
[1:47:44] high-heeled shoes
[1:47:46] and here was this you know his mama had
[1:47:48] the dream and brother said she wasn't
[1:47:50] much of a dreamer but here she had this
[1:47:52] dream of a woman wearing high-heeled
[1:47:54] shoes there's a lot within that I could
[1:47:56] preach on that after studying on those
[1:47:57] things like that because it's just
[1:47:58] incredible what what that all ties into
[1:48:01] of high heels and things like that but
[1:48:02] you know to look at this here here the
[1:48:05] woman she starts out and here's what she
[1:48:07] knows brother Brown said there were
[1:48:09] three steps that she had to come up and
[1:48:11] those three steps before she got into
[1:48:14] onto that pearly Highway that way that
[1:48:17] was there and he said now that's my
[1:48:19] message my message is justification
[1:48:21] sanctification by the blood and the
[1:48:24] baptism of the Holy Ghost and he said I
[1:48:26] was in the dream and he said I had spoke
[1:48:29] to that woman and I spoke to the rest of
[1:48:31] them and I said that you must come these
[1:48:35] three steps in order to walk that way
[1:48:38] now watch this watch the statement here
[1:48:40] and here this lady came by and when he
[1:48:44] spoke to her notice she was on her way
[1:48:47] and the Holy Spirit through the prophet
[1:48:49] caught her and said wait a minute sister
[1:48:52] you can't walk that Highway like that
[1:48:56] you can't do it thank God for that
[1:49:00] thank God for though let me tell you
[1:49:02] something the Holy Ghost is not here
[1:49:04] picking on you and trying to tear you
[1:49:06] down he's trying to take blinders off
[1:49:09] he's trying to shred veils because why
[1:49:13] he wants a relationship with you more
[1:49:16] than you desire it
[1:49:21] and he took all over and said hold on a
[1:49:23] minute you can't Walk This Way
[1:49:26] with them high-heeled shoes on
[1:49:30] and here's what she said she looked
[1:49:32] around at the rest of the women churches
[1:49:35] don't believe him he's a Madman don't
[1:49:38] believe him I'll show you I can be now
[1:49:40] listen to these statements I'll show you
[1:49:42] I can be justified Sanctified and filled
[1:49:45] with the Holy Ghost and still walk that
[1:49:48] now when brother Brandon's talking about
[1:49:49] being full of the Holy Ghost here
[1:49:51] he's not talking about where there's
[1:49:53] been a conversion on the soul
[1:49:58] but the brand tells us Demas was a
[1:50:01] Spirit-filled man
[1:50:04] does God change his mind he said Balaam
[1:50:06] was a Spirit-filled man
[1:50:10] but they weren't converted
[1:50:12] see the new birth is where there's a
[1:50:15] change on the inside not to where you're
[1:50:17] living under and anointing under a
[1:50:20] demonstration under an emotion but
[1:50:22] there's a life on the inside
[1:50:26] oh you hearing me now but you see where
[1:50:29] this woman she should have been what
[1:50:31] submissive to the word of God but
[1:50:34] instead she said I'm going to prove you
[1:50:36] wrong
[1:50:37] and brother Brown said now watch what
[1:50:38] brother Ram did I just let her go
[1:50:41] I couldn't do no more about it couldn't
[1:50:43] stop her you see God has not called us
[1:50:46] to try to arm wrestle and wrestle people
[1:50:48] and persuade people and this and that
[1:50:50] when Paul said I am you know trying to
[1:50:53] persuade you Paul was not trying to let
[1:50:55] me put a salesman's pitch on it what
[1:50:57] Paul was saying is I am yielding my life
[1:51:00] to Jesus Christ that he might come on
[1:51:03] the platform that he might speak the
[1:51:05] word because if there's any persuasion
[1:51:07] as far as breaking of hell it's got to
[1:51:10] be him but if he can't break the veil
[1:51:13] then there's then he can't be broken
[1:51:16] home and glory be to God if there's a
[1:51:19] veil to be broken and there's a
[1:51:21] pulsation in your heart that says Lord I
[1:51:24] want to know you then there is a veil to
[1:51:26] be broken there's a God to energize your
[1:51:29] life to break that Veil
[1:51:32] and this is what she did she jumped up
[1:51:34] on the highway
[1:51:36] and she looked at the other sisters the
[1:51:38] other churches see I told you
[1:51:40] brother Brandon gets us to the scripture
[1:51:42] of Isaiah 5 9 where they would want
[1:51:44] mincing feet and outstret outstretch
[1:51:46] your neck see that's in the scripture
[1:51:47] the high-heeled shoes
[1:51:50] now notice she started up that highway
[1:51:52] just as hard as she could run and after
[1:51:54] a while the road got narrower and
[1:51:56] narrower she started feeling and reeling
[1:51:59] and mincing like that and off she went
[1:52:02] now look look pretty good at first
[1:52:06] but eventually it got narrower
[1:52:11] the trials
[1:52:13] the tests
[1:52:15] it got narrower
[1:52:17] and because she wasn't established
[1:52:20] off she went
[1:52:22] you can look and say when she was
[1:52:24] walking on the highway but she didn't
[1:52:25] come the pathway that God had provided
[1:52:29] look brother Brown says see she obeyed
[1:52:31] just one word everything but just one
[1:52:35] word he said sure Pentecostal women can
[1:52:37] be saved Sanctified and filled with the
[1:52:38] Holy Ghost and then fail and man shall
[1:52:41] not live by bread alone but by every
[1:52:43] word that proceeds out of the mouth of
[1:52:45] God she failed she if she would have
[1:52:48] went on in all right but she failed to
[1:52:51] listen telling her what was ahead
[1:52:57] let me say it in this way
[1:53:00] you can see within that life
[1:53:03] she
[1:53:04] was telling the word
[1:53:07] what she was going to do
[1:53:10] and she was telling the word I don't
[1:53:12] need to do this
[1:53:14] remember what she said you're just a
[1:53:16] Madman
[1:53:17] you're overboard
[1:53:19] but brother Brown said eventually he
[1:53:21] said when she fell off
[1:53:23] and he said one of the most horriblest
[1:53:25] screams you ever heard
[1:53:28] you know why she was taking it for
[1:53:30] granted but there was a voice that came
[1:53:33] to her and let her know you're not going
[1:53:36] the right way
[1:53:40] and that's where the Holy Spirit he'll
[1:53:42] come and deal with our life we should
[1:53:44] never be ashamed to reflect in our own
[1:53:47] life
[1:53:48] friends you understand what I'm saying
[1:53:50] we're not looking at it today in your
[1:53:52] life and I'm asking you to question your
[1:53:54] experience but I am noticing that the
[1:53:57] Holy Spirit when he does come he will
[1:53:59] bring reflection in our life just don't
[1:54:02] take an emotion don't take a sensation
[1:54:05] don't even take an affiliation don't
[1:54:09] even take years that you've been around
[1:54:11] the message don't even take your
[1:54:14] knowledge don't take anything less
[1:54:18] been the full word of God the quickening
[1:54:21] power
[1:54:22] [Applause]
[1:54:31] let me just say it like this
[1:54:34] can I have a little bit more
[1:54:37] brother Ben said the Holy Ghost is a
[1:54:38] person let me go back to that quote I
[1:54:40] read in the beginning it's the action in
[1:54:42] you it's alive not an emotion not some
[1:54:44] sort of fleshly evidence but it is a
[1:54:46] person Jesus Christ the word of God
[1:54:49] established in your heart
[1:54:52] to Quicken every word for this age
[1:54:56] not just some of the words but he's
[1:54:59] there to Quicken every word
[1:55:02] make it alive to you and I
[1:55:06] that quickening power that lifts us from
[1:55:10] death unto life
[1:55:11] that same quickening power that comes
[1:55:14] forth that brought us out of the bar
[1:55:16] rooms wherever you were brother Graham
[1:55:18] said it was the quickening power that
[1:55:20] went out there and found you and began
[1:55:22] to speak to you that quickening power
[1:55:25] began to clean your life up and that
[1:55:27] same quickening power changed you and
[1:55:30] that same quickening power will raise
[1:55:32] you up one of these days
[1:55:37] David said it like this in Psalms 119
[1:55:40] turn away mine eyes from beholding
[1:55:42] vanity and Quicken thou me in thy way
[1:55:45] establish Thy word unto thy servant
[1:55:47] which is devoted to thy fear turn away
[1:55:51] my reproach which I fear for the
[1:55:53] Judgment for thy judgments are good
[1:55:55] behold I have longed after thy precepts
[1:55:58] Quicken me in thy righteousness
[1:56:01] another scripture is all right Psalms
[1:56:04] 119 88 Quicken me after thy loving
[1:56:07] kindness so shall I keep the testimony
[1:56:10] of thy mouth forever O Lord Thy word is
[1:56:13] settled in heaven thy faithfulness is
[1:56:15] unto all generations thou Hast
[1:56:17] established the Earth and it abideth
[1:56:19] they continue this day according to
[1:56:21] thine ordinances for all are thy
[1:56:24] servants
[1:56:26] I will never forget thy precepts for
[1:56:29] with them thou has quickened me
[1:56:35] David said in Psalms 40.
[1:56:37] he said I waited patiently for the Lord
[1:56:40] and He inclined unto me and heard My Cry
[1:56:44] he brought me up also out of a horrible
[1:56:46] pit and out of the Maori clay and set my
[1:56:49] feet up on a rock and established my
[1:56:52] Goings
[1:56:53] what did this the quickening power of
[1:56:56] God
[1:56:58] you know God's desire was to get this
[1:57:01] quickening power to you and I
[1:57:05] David had experiences with the
[1:57:07] quickening power of God but he could not
[1:57:10] have what you and I are privileged to by
[1:57:14] the new birth
[1:57:16] are you hearing me
[1:57:17] none of the prophets were privileged
[1:57:19] because that had to come through the
[1:57:22] Redeemer
[1:57:23] the Redeemer anointing the Redeemer word
[1:57:26] it came to release that of redemption to
[1:57:31] bring back what rightfully belonged to
[1:57:33] him
[1:57:34] and in order to get the brother-in
[1:57:36] center like this in order to get this
[1:57:37] quickening power into you and I he had
[1:57:40] to become flesh he had to pay the price
[1:57:42] through the shedding of his blood that
[1:57:45] then that same life could come to you
[1:57:48] and I
[1:57:49] and what would it do it does not raise
[1:57:51] up our Natural Life
[1:57:53] he raises up that which he has sowed
[1:57:58] of himself into our life
[1:58:01] and he raises that life up
[1:58:04] right just like that of a baby that's in
[1:58:07] the womb that baby begins to grow after
[1:58:11] that conception it begins to do what
[1:58:13] multiply sell on top of cell on top of
[1:58:16] cell
[1:58:17] and it's growing in that womb mama mama
[1:58:19] nourishes it she takes care of it Daddy
[1:58:22] makes the midnight runs does whatever he
[1:58:24] needs to do in order to get the
[1:58:26] nourishment and what's needed and what's
[1:58:27] called for and what's he doing that
[1:58:29] because there is a life that is in that
[1:58:31] womb that is calling for that
[1:58:33] nourishment
[1:58:34] and that's the same way that it is in
[1:58:37] the life of of an individual where there
[1:58:40] is a nourishing to the life that's on
[1:58:43] the inside now let me tell you something
[1:58:44] Sports will never feed that life on the
[1:58:47] inside
[1:58:48] news will never feed that life on the
[1:58:50] inside
[1:58:52] come on somebody
[1:58:54] yeah you know uh you know I you know I
[1:58:57] I'm going to look at this and I'm going
[1:58:59] to relieve you you do not relieve or
[1:59:01] relax by by taking in things of the
[1:59:05] world
[1:59:08] and I thought we were smarter than that
[1:59:12] come on Friends
[1:59:14] well I'm just going to relax now you
[1:59:16] know we're not against relaxing
[1:59:18] hello don't go don't get clamped down on
[1:59:20] me now but we recognize that there are
[1:59:22] things that how there's got to be a
[1:59:24] nourishing and a nurturing of that life
[1:59:27] that is on the inside of us and remember
[1:59:30] the Holy Ghost if you have been born
[1:59:33] again now listen one of the key
[1:59:35] attributes it's not just what I don't
[1:59:37] smoke no more I don't drink no more I
[1:59:40] don't run around no more I don't look at
[1:59:42] this on the internet no more I don't do
[1:59:43] that it's no thank God there is a
[1:59:45] sanctifying but when the Holy Ghost has
[1:59:48] come it is a union with you and Jesus
[1:59:52] Christ if it's not a love affair then
[1:59:55] you've never been born again
[1:59:58] oh
[2:00:01] now can you get called yeah you can get
[2:00:04] cold and the Holy Spirit will correct
[2:00:06] you
[2:00:09] now you ain't gonna pound on me now are
[2:00:11] you you make it harder than the last bit
[2:00:13] I got to preach here then
[2:00:15] but it's a received from God and say
[2:00:17] Lord I want to know you more
[2:00:20] I want to know you more because when the
[2:00:23] quickening power has come it does not
[2:00:25] bring us into listen friends I'm afraid
[2:00:28] too many times that people have become
[2:00:30] in love with the church they've been
[2:00:32] become listen I thank God that people do
[2:00:35] want to come here
[2:00:37] are you hearing me this is not a this is
[2:00:39] not a church of the open diction
[2:00:41] dictator that is just dictating what you
[2:00:43] do and you do this and you do that I
[2:00:46] believe that it's the holy ghost that
[2:00:48] bursts people into the kingdom of God
[2:00:50] it's not a pastor it's not a man it's
[2:00:54] Jesus Christ
[2:00:56] I believe that with all my heart
[2:00:59] I know that to be the truth I'm witness
[2:01:02] to that
[2:01:05] thank God people do want to come around
[2:01:11] but you know what God knows who belongs
[2:01:13] to him
[2:01:16] God knows who belongs to him
[2:01:18] sometimes I wonder if we are too busy
[2:01:21] trying to cram down the word down
[2:01:22] people's throat to forget and say wait a
[2:01:24] minute here let's nurture those who are
[2:01:26] receiving it
[2:01:31] come on Friends
[2:01:33] it's not that we don't reach out to one
[2:01:35] another but you understand what I'm
[2:01:36] saying sometimes we get to focusing on
[2:01:39] the wrong things I never forget my
[2:01:40] brother when he had that whole thing of
[2:01:42] a had illiterate Rottweilers there at
[2:01:44] that time and he took him into the Vet
[2:01:45] you know there are them babies and they
[2:01:47] had they I mean just where the vet had
[2:01:48] to come actually when those when those
[2:01:50] pups were born and he got out there and
[2:01:52] with those pups and the way they were
[2:01:54] there was couple there that were
[2:01:56] actually just laying there there you
[2:01:57] know they hadn't hadn't been breathing
[2:01:59] and all that sense of birth and so forth
[2:02:01] and you know my brother got over there
[2:02:02] on him and the bet the vet was telling
[2:02:04] me when all this had happened said here
[2:02:06] I want you you need to be rubbing all
[2:02:07] these puppies because they'd come early
[2:02:09] you need to be rubbing and warming them
[2:02:10] up you need to be doing this right here
[2:02:11] and he was doing it he was doing it and
[2:02:13] then he was drawn to these two and he
[2:02:15] kept on rubbing these two he kept on
[2:02:16] rubbing these two he kept on rubbing
[2:02:18] these two eventually the vet came to him
[2:02:20] and said put them down
[2:02:23] focus on these
[2:02:25] these have already passed
[2:02:33] are you hearing me don't let the devil
[2:02:34] interpret anything to your mind what I
[2:02:37] am speaking to you clearly is let's
[2:02:39] focus on the things of almighty God
[2:02:43] is the one who takes the word and brings
[2:02:46] it into our hearts and our lives it's
[2:02:48] gone let me tell you something friends
[2:02:49] that's why we don't write nobody off but
[2:02:52] we need to focus on the things of
[2:02:55] almighty God
[2:02:58] there
[2:03:04] is
[2:03:08] I hope it's all right
[2:03:13] but Brian said it like this he said that
[2:03:14] Earnest of the quickening power is the
[2:03:17] potential that's there in your life
[2:03:20] the quickening power of your
[2:03:22] resurrection and he said you're on your
[2:03:24] way now by the quickening power you're
[2:03:26] on your way you're growing to a full
[2:03:29] Resurrection no tree just comes up
[2:03:31] overnight it's got to grow as we grow in
[2:03:34] the grace and knowledge of God you are
[2:03:36] baptized into the Holy Spirit and he
[2:03:39] said we just keep growing we keep
[2:03:41] growing we keep going on and on and on
[2:03:43] and on the word keeps quickening and as
[2:03:46] you come to the first limb second limb
[2:03:47] third limb on up it keeps quickening and
[2:03:49] quickening and the spirit of God keeps
[2:03:51] quickening to you
[2:03:55] now think of this
[2:03:57] David would write over and over and over
[2:04:00] because
[2:04:01] of the quickening power of God and some
[2:04:04] of them I read to you there's more I
[2:04:05] could read to you and David would write
[2:04:08] about in the time of his afflictions
[2:04:10] David would say this three different
[2:04:11] times concerning his affliction
[2:04:14] that this is my comfort when I am
[2:04:16] Afflicted that Thy word has quickened me
[2:04:22] that's one place to draw your comfort
[2:04:24] from the word has quickened me
[2:04:28] Psalms 119 107 I am Afflicted very much
[2:04:31] Quicken Me O Lord according unto Thy
[2:04:36] word now notice he's comforted by the
[2:04:38] quickening that has come into his life
[2:04:40] and now through that quickening he's
[2:04:43] asking he's asking God Quicken me
[2:04:46] according to your word
[2:04:48] Psalms 119 and verse 53 he said consider
[2:04:52] my Affliction and deliver me for I do
[2:04:54] not forget thy law plead my cause and
[2:04:57] deliver me and Quicken me according to
[2:05:00] Thy Word
[2:05:03] I think of this
[2:05:05] David in each of those he's asking God
[2:05:09] to further Quicken him
[2:05:12] David is not in a place of saying
[2:05:15] Lord I've reached the summit
[2:05:18] but David said I know there is comfort
[2:05:20] that I draw from how you have quickened
[2:05:22] me according to your word I can draw
[2:05:24] Comfort now what Comfort does David draw
[2:05:26] that Lord you will Quicken me in mine
[2:05:30] affliction
[2:05:31] you will give me Deliverance in mine
[2:05:35] affliction you will strengthen me in
[2:05:38] mine affliction
[2:05:39] when's the last time we've asked God
[2:05:41] Quicken Me Lord
[2:05:44] Quicken me
[2:05:46] you can't find a message
[2:05:49] even after the seals and you start
[2:05:52] dealing with the word quickening it
[2:05:53] comes later on within them it's always
[2:05:55] through but brother Brown you'll hear
[2:05:57] him in the opening parts of the message
[2:05:59] quickness Lord
[2:06:01] Quicken more of the word to us
[2:06:04] quickness Lord what's he doing Lord make
[2:06:07] it alive to us make it more real to us
[2:06:10] Lord cause it to stand out more in our
[2:06:12] life that's what I pray
[2:06:14] I normally pray for my life I pray for
[2:06:16] the whole assembly God Quicken us more
[2:06:19] Quicken us more Lord Jesus Quicken us
[2:06:23] more
[2:06:24] let me just come back to something in
[2:06:26] case that's laying on somebody's mind
[2:06:28] we're not forgetting about anybody
[2:06:30] don't you let the devil get on I'm going
[2:06:32] to come back and address it because it
[2:06:34] keeps coming here
[2:06:35] you don't you let the devil beat you
[2:06:37] over that well brother Samuel don't care
[2:06:39] about this and but or so-and-so don't
[2:06:40] care no what I'm saying is is that
[2:06:42] sometimes we get to focusing on things
[2:06:45] instead of focusing on what God's doing
[2:06:49] are you hearing me in other words we got
[2:06:52] too many negative nancies around
[2:06:54] not enough positive peats
[2:06:57] are you hearing me I understand there's
[2:06:59] negative all around but why do I do you
[2:07:02] think I want a fellowship on negative I
[2:07:04] don't want a fellowship on negative
[2:07:06] I know there's problems all around but
[2:07:09] let me tell you something that's greater
[2:07:10] than every problem and it'll take care
[2:07:13] of every situation in this church and
[2:07:17] that's Jesus Christ
[2:07:19] he didn't say if the negative be lifted
[2:07:22] up he said if I be lifted up
[2:07:29] too many times we're giving ourself to
[2:07:31] the negative things
[2:07:35] come on we're not Balaam looking at the
[2:07:37] hinder parts
[2:07:39] [Applause]
[2:07:41] come on somebody
[2:07:42] we've got a mighty God in the camp
[2:07:47] I'm saying there's no situation I have
[2:07:50] watched God in the past years there is
[2:07:53] no situation that is wrote off in the
[2:07:56] presence of almighty God
[2:07:59] no situation
[2:08:01] God has turned lives around situations
[2:08:04] around he's brought lives back into to
[2:08:08] walk in the truth and give them a real
[2:08:10] experience
[2:08:15] there's nothing beyond God
[2:08:18] I tell you what we need to be praying is
[2:08:20] Lord Quicken us Lord Quicken us Lord
[2:08:23] Quicken us according to your word
[2:08:26] Quicken us a pire lord Quicken us a fire
[2:08:32] we're under a quickening message
[2:08:35] Hallelujah that makes the word alive
[2:08:38] that establishes us
[2:08:45] and we need to be exercising in our
[2:08:47] lives say Lord
[2:08:49] establish Me Lord
[2:08:51] let my life scriptures I could continue
[2:08:53] to read to you about God
[2:08:56] being faithful
[2:08:58] David Paul would say like this the Lord
[2:09:01] is faithful who shall establish you and
[2:09:05] keep you from all evil
[2:09:07] what's he doing putting our focus in him
[2:09:11] it's our focus in him just like we've
[2:09:12] been covering in the midweek service
[2:09:14] that Joshua did not know how that he was
[2:09:17] going to build walls were going to come
[2:09:18] down but what he needed was his what
[2:09:22] came and that was the Lord
[2:09:26] are you hearing me friends yeah
[2:09:30] that's I'm telling you he's here I'm
[2:09:32] trying to tell you there's somebody
[2:09:33] closer to you than your pastor
[2:09:35] I'm trying to tell you there's somebody
[2:09:36] who go with you I'm trying to tell you
[2:09:38] that there's somebody that when you talk
[2:09:40] to him if you just pour out your heart
[2:09:42] before him he will come
[2:09:46] he'll do for you what nobody else can do
[2:09:49] for you
[2:09:50] I'm only trying to point you to him he's
[2:09:53] the one that's here
[2:09:56] he's the one that's right Among Us he's
[2:09:58] the one that's changed your life he's
[2:10:00] the one that fills with the Holy Ghost
[2:10:01] he's the one that's been Healing The
[2:10:03] Sick he's the one that's been delivering
[2:10:07] we don't need to make anything happen
[2:10:09] all we need to do is wait with an
[2:10:12] assurance
[2:10:14] an assurance that God answers and
[2:10:18] fulfills every word
[2:10:23] and he'll establish you
[2:10:25] and he continues to establish you with
[2:10:29] every word
[2:10:31] as you're growing it's the quickening
[2:10:34] power of God at work in your life
[2:10:38] quickening quickening quickening
[2:10:41] quickening
[2:10:46] but you have to give place to the word
[2:10:50] say Lord
[2:10:52] make it alive to me
[2:10:55] make it real to me Lord
[2:10:58] in your prayer life Lord Quicken me like
[2:11:00] David all those in Psalms 119 you can go
[2:11:01] through them Quicken down me according
[2:11:04] to Thy Word
[2:11:05] praying and asking God Quicken me
[2:11:08] brother Brown said it like this on three
[2:11:10] kinds of Believers he said the same God
[2:11:12] that quickened me from Death unto life
[2:11:14] one of these mornings
[2:11:17] he said that quickening will come
[2:11:19] and pack me into the prince of God
[2:11:22] you see that we're under a quickening
[2:11:24] message that is not stopping it's
[2:11:27] quickening us on up
[2:11:29] that's why within our lives we step back
[2:11:32] and are waiting
[2:11:34] as God establishes our life establishing
[2:11:38] Us in the word it's God quickening us
[2:11:41] and realizing God has put it into our
[2:11:43] hands God's put it into your hands not
[2:11:46] mine but see when the word comes forth
[2:11:47] it stirs something up in US what is it
[2:11:50] it stirs something up maybe there's
[2:11:52] things that has got clouded up but he
[2:11:54] stirs that up in our life and like David
[2:11:56] you might be afflicted maybe you're
[2:11:58] Afflicted in your body Afflicted in your
[2:12:00] mind Afflicted in your spirit but you're
[2:12:02] Afflicted but you can say God quickened
[2:12:04] thou Me Lord
[2:12:06] and that's what that's what brings
[2:12:08] healing that's what brings difference
[2:12:09] that what's that's what brings
[2:12:11] everything of God to you and I
[2:12:14] personally is the quickening power of
[2:12:16] God
[2:12:17] they call it out there in the world they
[2:12:19] call it an aha moment in the classroom
[2:12:21] oh you can see your students go hahaha
[2:12:23] oh I got it let me tell you something
[2:12:25] the real aha moment
[2:12:27] is the quickening power of God
[2:12:32] and God's quickening that word
[2:12:33] quickening it clicking it
[2:12:37] that's how I want my prayer life to be
[2:12:39] how about you
[2:12:43] God let that be a part of regular verb
[2:12:45] vocabulary a lot Quicken that to me even
[2:12:47] while the words being preached and that
[2:12:49] word's coming forth quicker than that to
[2:12:50] me Lord Quicken it to me Lord Quicken me
[2:12:53] to hit Lord make it alive in my life
[2:12:55] Lord God if it comes my way and there's
[2:12:57] something that he says Samuel you've got
[2:12:59] this in the room I want to make room for
[2:13:01] it
[2:13:02] you know what I mean it's like your
[2:13:04] sister say oh we need this new design
[2:13:06] right here and your husband says where
[2:13:07] are we going to put it down on the wall
[2:13:11] where are they going to put it at
[2:13:13] right that means something's got to go
[2:13:16] you've got to make room for it
[2:13:18] we're the same God that's wanting to
[2:13:20] make a deposit he's also the same God
[2:13:23] that will give you the strength to make
[2:13:26] room for it
[2:13:28] he ain't wanting you to put it somewhere
[2:13:30] in a closet and save it for some garage
[2:13:32] sale you'll never have in your life he's
[2:13:34] wanting you to get rid of it the word
[2:13:36] wants to make room for its help it's
[2:13:39] that little white button on the inside
[2:13:43] it's crawling it's pushing out on the
[2:13:46] inside what's it happening there's a
[2:13:48] nurturing it's being fed on the word of
[2:13:52] God
[2:13:52] [Music]
[2:13:54] starts out that way
[2:14:00] but I believe it's bigger today
[2:14:04] and I'm going to keep feeding until it
[2:14:06] gets bigger
[2:14:09] you know you know how much I want to
[2:14:11] feed it I want to feed it to where it's
[2:14:12] pressing out
[2:14:15] eventually you can just start seeing in
[2:14:17] my life like a little baby on the inside
[2:14:20] when my mom when I'm not my mom when my
[2:14:23] wife was carrying our boys you know
[2:14:25] there's times when you know you could
[2:14:26] see the Kapow or the power I don't know
[2:14:29] which one it was foot or fish whatever
[2:14:30] it was but you could see it oh you feel
[2:14:32] that kick oh you feel that right there
[2:14:34] oh you feel that what was it it was a
[2:14:36] life on the inside identifying itself
[2:14:39] that I'm alive Oh Glory oh we had to
[2:14:42] start with at first was a little picture
[2:14:46] Glory Be Todd oh I know they say oh you
[2:14:50] got the little bump now you got the
[2:14:51] little Bob but all you started with was
[2:14:53] a picture and that picture you could see

[2:27:24] people say different things such as
[2:27:25] we've reached the summit and your
[2:27:27] Prophet would say it in this way
[2:27:30] he said there is no Summit in God
[2:27:33] and we know we're living under a
[2:27:35] Capstone Ministry but that Capstone is
[2:27:37] him
[2:27:38] the Eternal one
[2:27:40] there is no beginning or ending in him
[2:27:45] then Lord we can continue to ascend

[2:28:32] and say Lord I forsake man I just lay it
[2:28:34] down remember the same year it's that
[2:28:36] simple that's what he said he said lay
[2:28:38] it aside and if he said lay it aside
[2:28:40] then he's the one that's giving you
[2:28:41] authority to do it as John said I turned
[2:28:45] to see the voice that's taken to me look
[2:28:48] at the voice that is speaking to you and
