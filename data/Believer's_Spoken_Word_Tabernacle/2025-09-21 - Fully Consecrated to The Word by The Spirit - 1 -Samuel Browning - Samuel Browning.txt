How many loves when God goes down into your life and individually it's speaking to everybody but you know he's individually speaking to you. Let's just pray that word of God speak this morning as a pastor comes. I'm finding myself at a loss for words. And the funny thing is it's okay. The last thing I need is to be heard but to hear what you would say. Word of God speak. Would you pour down my grave, washing my eyes to see your majesty to be still and know your in this place. Please let me stay and rest in your holiness. Word of God speak. Yes, Lord. [Music] Finding myself. I believe that this morning, Lord, in the midst of you, beyond the music, beyond the door.

Word of God speak. Oh, word of God speak. Would you pour down my grace, washing my eyes to see your majesty to be still and know that you're in this place. Please let me stay and rest in your holiness. Word of God speak. So sing that as brother S. Holy Spirit rain down. Let's all stand as brother S comes. Holy Spirit rain [Music] down rain down. Oh, and friend, how we need your touch again. Holy Spirit, rain, rain down. Glor down. Let you powerful. &gt;&gt; Let your voice be heard. Come and change our hearts as we s [Music] rain rain down. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Certainly there's no greater desire, amen, that we would have that he would just move among us in a special way. &gt;&gt; Amen. That the Holy Spirit would just so saturate our hearts and our lives aresh and we would leave from this place this morning should he tar different people than when we walked in. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just more of less of us and more of him. And uh I certainly believe and I think we can agree together he's able to do the exceeding abundantly above all that we could think or ask. &gt;&gt; You believe that this morning? &gt;&gt; You know even every time when we come to the house of God, you know every service is always unique. Every service is unique. Every service is different. But you know what really makes the service is the expectation. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's the Holy Spirit just moving in our midst. And where there's an expectation in our hearts. And I pray that I pray that if any of that has been lost, may the Holy Spirit come &gt;&gt; with a great raise and warmth of his love and rekindle &gt;&gt; that in our lives. Because we are people of an expectation all the way down through the ages. &gt;&gt; They have lived for his coming. They did not know. Paul did not know that the coming of the Lord was not in his day. &gt;&gt; He said, "For we shall not all sleep." &gt;&gt; Paul was looking for the coming of the Lord in his generation. The prophet said, "Every one of them went into the grave running in stride with that message. Yes. &gt;&gt; And when the resurrection comes, they're not going to miss a beat. They'll come right They'll come out running right right in the stretch. &gt;&gt; They were people of expectation. &gt;&gt; They were believers. They had battles just like you and I do. We have to battle through commonality and commonness of life. We have to battle to where that the pressures and everything of life, it would like to try to pull from us an expectation to where we would just become ritual. And you know what can do that? Just life. Just allowing things to get between us and God. But I say, God, let everything be cleared out of the way. there's anything that is working to try to hinder that and take that out of the way. That's God's desire is that our hearts would be filled with such an expectation that in our hearts not just for a service here this morning but for every day of our life to expect his coming to expect God and to just expect him to move upon our lives and to speak to our hearts. There's no greater to me, friends. There's no greater pleasure than to be in his presence &gt;&gt; and that he would speak to our hearts and our lives. There's no And you know what? That's not something that's just confined here to this to this walls just here with this week. Just to give you an example, and I know you could share with this. I'm just driving and I'm on my way here and there's a message and I actually thought I had turned to listen to another message because I had to do a few tasks while I was on my way here. And I'm listening and I'm thinking, "Wow, that message is almost Brother staying out with starting out with some of the same things that I've been listening to out of this particular message over here." And I thought, "Wow, that's just more." And I thought, well, when I get to a stop, I can grab some of that and put that into another study. And I began to realize that message didn't kick over to the message that I was wanting to listen to at that moment. It reverted right back into the message that I had already been listening to a couple times through the week. And right there in that moment, the Holy Spirit just spoke something to my heart. And I pray that God will allow me at some point to share this with you. But it spoke to my heart. And I tell you, the presence of God just come right there &gt;&gt; in that car. And I just begin to worship. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you wish you had a self-driving car. Just begin to worship. Begin to thank God for his goodness. It wasn't just about the thought. It wasn't just something to speak, but what it was about was it was about him &gt;&gt; and him and who he is &gt;&gt; to me. What he is to me and what his desire is in our lives is that everything that he would remain completely the the full view of our lives. Amen. So good to be together together uh here this even this morning and so glad to have brother James, brother Justin, and good to have each and every one of you. Amen. Good to have brother Bobby and sister Michelle and Chrissy here with us this morning as well. Amen. It's good to be in his presence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so let's just look to the Lord in a word of prayer before we turn into the scriptures. I want to say musicians, thank you so much. Amen. Let's just go to the Lord in a word of prayer here. Our heavenly father Lord as we just oh God are so thankful Lord for these moments that you Lord permit and you just give to us Lord allow us to come and Lord we thank you for the Lord the strength and the fortitude Lord to press beyond Lord our flesh our feelings beyond every thought for Lord we know that Lord there is a blessing Lord that is for us Lord from you. Lord, sometimes when we come here, Lord, as we come with tests and trials, as I heard brother Brian mention, sometimes Lord, with the pre pressures and the cares of life that we go through and Lord, yet if there wasn't the pressures and the cares, Lord, when we look at in our lives, Lord, perhaps Lord, we would not be as Lord fervent as we need to be in seeking you. And this is why that Paul would even write of this. Lord, we bear about in our body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life of the Lord Jesus might be made manifest as well. And Lord, we are certainly do not count ourselves or think that we are able to bear these burdens or these pressures. But Lord, we allow and we go to you in prayer for we know that you are the way maker. Lord, you're the one to make a way through every circumstance and situation of life. And Lord, we ask only that you would just give us the grace, Lord. And may our vision be unhindered, Lord. May, Lord, it be focused upon you. And may we see you clearly, Lord. For truly, Lord, you're not absent. You've not, Lord, become disinterested, Lord, but yet you're standing right in the midst of your church, Lord. You're directing and governing over all the affairs of men. Father, you are our husband, our bridegroom, Lord. You are our lover, Lord, our savior, our redeemer. You care, Lord, for us, Lord. You watch over us, Lord. And we're so thankful for that. And we would ask that God, that even here this morning, Lord, may you just come, Lord, according to every heart and every need. Lord, we just give ourselves to you Lord unreservedly, not as not only as speaker but as hearer. I pray that God that may everything Lord Jesus just be Lord such a clear and an open channel to you and Lord if there be anything Lord in any channel of our lives that would be hindering Lord may you Lord bring that forth Lord direct it because our desire Lord is to bear fruit Lord to bear that expression oh God of of your own life there's no greater there's no greater name that we could be called than to be known as Mrs. Jesus Christ, a real Christian, a real believer. Lord, as the prophet said, if you love me, call me brother. Lord Jesus, we just ask here this morning that you'll presence will just sweep through this congregation, Lord. Move, Lord, upon every heart and every life. And Lord, we just ask that you would direct your word, Lord. And just give me, Lord, just even the direction I need, Lord. Oh God, under the inspiration that you've placed on my heart, I stand here, Lord, just as your servant, Lord, and a servant to your people, Lord. May you come, Lord, I pray, and minister to every need and every heart. May the love of God, so Lord, take a hold and wrap our hearts and draw us closer to you, Lord. I pray we commit this service, Lord, into your hands. And just ask God for your blessing now upon the word in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to go into the word here into Leviticus chapter 8. And I'm going to ask you to keep your Bibles handy because I'm not going to I did not put up every single places and portions of scripture that I'm going to refer to here this morning. And I want to kind of build a little bit of a um of a background uh and where that we are going. And there's no way uh that with this particular uh subthought I'm I'm not going to get close. I'm not going to get finished here this morning. I know that. But we'll get to where he wants us to get to. And so in Leviticus uh chapter 8 and verse one, now this this whole uh portion of scripture, the whole chapter 8 is the installing of priests into the priesthood. Not only the high priest but the priest. And we recognize that our high priest is the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And I want to just make this very clear that the Lord Jesus Christ is not a different person than God himself. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It's very key. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God restored in this hour the revelation of the Godhead. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God brought that about not just to um you know just to tickle our ears or not just to be something that's good or to be something to bait it or to be something to look down on someone else. I believe we understand that. But God revealed that revelation of the Godhead. It reveals who you and I really are. &gt;&gt; That's right. And it brings to light in this hour where the bride body that's been been in building all the way through is coming to a time of the capping where the headstone. We've received the message of the capstone, the message of the headstone. And what God is doing is bringing a people into that place of maturity. So here's a bride body that's been going on down through the ages. And now God through through his word is bringing a people together that they might see God's full intended purpose that God would dwell supremely in his bride body. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; I know that might seem like a mouthful, but we'll just try to get through that within this time. Leviticus chapter 8 and verse one. And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, and I think that's key. God didn't deliver this to anyone else. &gt;&gt; It's to Moses. &gt;&gt; Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, the anointing oil, and a bulock for the scent offering, and two rams, and a basket of unleavened bread. and gather thou all the congregation together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. And Moses did as the Lord commanded him. And the assembly was gathered together unto the door of the congregation. And Moses said unto the congregation, this is the thing which the Lord commanded to be done. Amen. May God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated. I want to just in speaking of of of these things and how that the priest would be installed. I want you to remember, we've read, we've touched certain scriptures throughout for the past few weeks and touched on a few things where Peter would write, "You are a royal priesthood, a chosen generation." And he would say, "You a spiritual priesthood." and how that not only you would be a part of the building of the body of Jesus Christ of how that a spiritual house, a spiritual dwelling place. So a a temple where God would would reside in in the life of his children. And that's where that's where the revelation of the Godhead comes in to be able to see and recognize. when we can see and recognize who who Jesus was, how God came down and became one of us that it was that same example that God desires to dwell the same way within our lives. &gt;&gt; And so that same that that same deity, that same that same uh quality of himself would would so reside within our hearts. And this is why that when we see this of the Godhead, we recognize that Jesus is not the second person of the Godhead. And I know these are very uh simple things but you know uh sometimes how that the uh our minds sometimes and how within this hour can become construed and I'm not necessarily saying our minds but I'm saying it for the the the whole and the benefit of all of us to recognize that when John would write by the spirit of God he would speak of the love of God and the spirit of God and where we would stand in God and he would say that we are in this world now as he is. And to recognize that it's it's where the perfection of the sacrifice of the blood of the lamb and the life that was in that blood has now come back upon the worshipper and brought the worshipper into this place of fellowship with God that God intended man to dwell with. Now within this part here, I what I want to speak on is is fully consecrated to the word by the spirit. And I want to go just a few moments here. I want to go back into Hebrews chapter 7 if you'll turn there with me. And as I said, there's few places I'm going to ask you to turn in your scriptures here this morning. I have it here in front of me, but I just I would rather turn to it. Um, sometimes it's some of those points where I just want to just move in here. Uh, and just to pick up a few things and I want you to see that with Paul himself. And when Paul, it could be none other who wrote the book of Hebrews. And it's not Paul's intellect, but remember the Bible says that men, holy men of old, were moved upon by the Holy Spirit. And they would write under divine revelation, God bringing and tying things together. And Paul being the messenger to that first age, Paul being uh the prophet of of God in that hour, Paul would be able to take that and show that of law and grace and how that the law had been completely fulfilled through the grace of Jesus Christ. and then be able to present this to you and I. And I want to say this that Paul, we we we we we have such a uh I believe a settleness here in our hearts to recognize that when Paul would write of these things and write all the way through the book of Hebrews, if we can sum everything up in the book of Hebrews, Paul is simply only declaring the position where the Lord Jesus has been exalted to that he's above it all. Amen. &gt;&gt; That it is very the very God become one of us. It's God become flesh. It's God become one of us. He he is the exalted one that's in our midst. He is the word. He's the living God. And Paul Paul catches this. Now remember Paul his the revelation that Paul has. Paul saw him. The prophet would say this over and over and point this out because it's very key. Paul saw him after his death, burial, and resurrection, and after the Holy Spirit had come. Paul met him after he had returned back to a pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; God condescended all the way down for redemption because in just that form of pillar of fire, he couldn't redeem you and I. &gt;&gt; But God had to now come all the way. He comes all the way down. And now that pillar of fire had become a man, &gt;&gt; right? It's just like when they came to the river Jordan, the pillar of fire led them all the way up to the river Jordan. But when they came across the Jordan, the pillar of fire revealed itself as a man, &gt;&gt; captain of the Lord's host. That's right. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; I'm here to lead all the way. So now that within this of the pillar of fire, now coming back within the finished work of redemption because when he uh purged our sins, the Bible said he has sat down on the right hand of God. And we understand that right hand means power and authority. And he is there until his enemies of being made his foottool until although that Paul would say we see not all things yet, but we see Jesus. And that's what's important even when it comes down even into our lives that you may not see everything about in your life that you desire to see and want to see. But I'll tell you, it won't come any other way except by the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; And when I'm talking about the Lord Jesus, I'm not talking about the the body. I'm talking about the spirit of the living God. Because when Paul met him on the road to Damascus and he said, "Lord, who are you?" He saw that light, Paul understood enough that when that light appeared, it's God making himself known to his people and he said, "Who are you?" He said, "I am Jesus whom thou persecutest." &gt;&gt; So how God came down and remember that body is God's body. God created that body to come down and pay the price for you and I. &gt;&gt; Remember the prophet tells us in the token, he says in order for redemption to come, God had to get himself a son back again. And the only way that could happen is is God would have to create and bring forth a body. And God created that body by his word. &gt;&gt; Mary did not help it. Mary did not assist it. Mary did not lend an egg to it. It was indeed the creation of almighty God. Do &gt;&gt; you know how glorious that is that there could come through and through his life that you and I could be brought to a place to be so loosened and so free from our own family tree to be so loosened and to be free from any defilement of sin and unbelief through and by that one and perfect offering and the Holy Spirit coming into our lives to make that real. You are free. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's how glorious the offering of the Lord Jesus Christ is. &gt;&gt; There's no other there's no other greater name, no bigger name than the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Paul said, "Who are you?" He said, "I'm Jesus." &gt;&gt; Whom thou persecutest. Now Paul comes in here in Hebrews 7 and we referred to this even a few weeks ago and then last week and Paul picks up about this mysterious one who is is is it reveals himself as Melzdc. And notice how Paul uh points this out in Hebrews 7 that this one who met Abraham and whom Abraham gave a tenth of all here here he is the king of Salem, king of the most high God. And here first being by interpretation, verse two, king of righteousness, after that king of Salem, which is king of peace, without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like unto the son of God, abideth a priest continually. So God come down in veiled himself in light in the &gt;&gt; which is no marvel because the Bible says when the fall took place in the garden it says that they heard the voice of God walking &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; God dwells in a body and so here God dwelling here in theophony ex revealing himself to Abraham in that hour. Now I want to just I want to tie this in here. Without father, without mother, there can leave no doubt of who this is. &gt;&gt; There's only one eternal one. &gt;&gt; Is that right? And that's God without father, without mother. Is that right? But now so within this but with when he met Abraham this way as he met Abraham even standing before his tent door he could not redeem Abraham then because he had to come through and by a woman. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Is that Galatians 4? &gt;&gt; God in order to redeem us who were under the law. We couldn't get out of it. We were held guilty. We were even though as we were offering the blood of the lamb but the blood of the lamb, the blood of bulls and goats was not a perfect lamb. It could not take away the desire of sin, we would allow us to stand in God's presence, but it could not deal with the where the real problem was at. &gt;&gt; And I'm glad that God provided a blood that could deal with the with the real issue. &gt;&gt; How we thank God for forgiveness. how we thank God for the grace of God and we need it. But I want to say this to you this morning. Don't live beneath your privileges to where you have to say, "Well, I'll always have this habit or this besetting sin or this." No, you need to understand the blood of Jesus Christ is a perfect blood. Amen. &gt;&gt; It was shed to free you, to loosen you to where that you would be able to claim and bring down into your life what he has provided for you and I. &gt;&gt; You don't have to be if you're a servant to anything, servant to an attitude, servant to a complex, you're living beneath your privileges. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Soon as God reveals it, stand against that thing and say, "I resist you, Lord. forgive me for allowing that to reside in my life that way. &gt;&gt; That is so good. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Paul would go on to write considering how great this man is. But &gt;&gt; let me just let me move here into the scripture and let's move here to verse 17 or verse 16 or maybe 15. And it's yet far more evident for that after the similitude of Melzdc there ariseth another priest. Notice after the similitude Melzdc was made like unto the son of God. So when you're thinking of son of God don't think of flesh think of theophony think of light. Are you with me? Now God come down and God through the creation there creates a body that he himself might come for the purpose of redemption. And this is where the scripture says that he was made after the similitude of Melzdc. There ariseth another priest. Who is that priest? The Lord Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; who is made not after the law of a carnal commandment but after the power of an endless life. For he testified, thou art a priest forever after the order of Melzdc. For there is verily a disanoing of the commandment going before, for the weakness and the profitableness thereof. For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did by the which we draw nigh unto God. And in as much as not without an oath, he was made priest. For those priests were made without an oath, but this with an oath by him that said, "The Lord swear and will not repent. Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melzdc." Brother Ram said Jesus could give his life. This man couldn't because he was life. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; He's not separating the two. He's showing us the same God come down. God condescending all the way down. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because now notice as we see this this this this Melazdc by so much was Jesus made assurityity of a better testament. And he goes on in verse 23, they were many priests and they were suffered not to continue by reason of death. But this man because he continuthth ever hath an unchangeable priesthood. Oh, I love this. He is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him. &gt;&gt; He's not a way. &gt;&gt; He's the way. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The way was kept all the way when he placed the flaming the the cherubam with the flaming sword. The way was kept white. God was saying, "I'm going to make a way back for man to come back from where he fell from." All right. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And so now notice what a what a to me I love that scripture. He is able to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them. Let me just say this for you and I that not only when his blood was shed did he go back through and intercede for all of them. Listen, he descended to the lowest parts of hell. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. And he came there and rising up with the proof of his own blood and paradise which was a holding place. It was not hell. It was a holding place that was reserved there in the bosom of Abraham where the promise was to come of the redeemer. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; And when he comes there he's able to present and say I have paid the price. I have loosened and taken care of the debt. and what was against them where they they followed me by the revelation of the blood of bulls and goats. But now waiting for that perfect lamb. I am that perfect lamb. &gt;&gt; Do you understand what the authority of that word was in Jesus third pull ministry? It was to declare I am he. I have done the work. I am finished. He was to reveal himself as the mighty conqueror. the one who has taken care of the sin problem and the sin issue. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says it's to the eternal lost, but it's for the elect. &gt;&gt; The manifestation of this word is not to show everybody how wrong they are. That's not what he's saying in that statement. Others can see it, but they don't recognize who it is, what it is, and what we're called to. &gt;&gt; But I say, "Blessed are your ears that hear. Amen. &gt;&gt; Blessed are your eyes that see. &gt;&gt; Not just to be a part of a church. &gt;&gt; Not just to be a part. The message is not a movement. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The message is the voice of God coming straight from the throne. Get under the blood. &gt;&gt; Because you're not safe in a church. The only place of safety is under the blood where the Holy Spirit has sealed you in. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; For such a high priest became us, who's holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, made higher than the heavens, who needeth not daily as those high priests to offer up sacrifice first for his own sins, and then for the peoples. For this he did once when he offered up himself. He did not offer himself up because of his own sins. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Those priests made by a carnal commandment that of the law, they had to offer sacrifices because they were standing in need. &gt;&gt; That's why there's no holy man. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; There is no holy man. There's not this personal. There's no personality when when we stand in Revelations 5 and we see from Revelations 5, Paul pointing it out in Hebrews 12 that there's only one that that is to be seen and to be visible and to be known that in him is all that I have need of and that is worthy is the lamb. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; That's what this message come to do. The message did not come to to bring us in and you know here we become you know oh so isolated. We're not isolated &gt;&gt; by our own thinking. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's what denominations are. I'm not throwing down. Remember there's good people in there but they isolate. Well, you can't fellowship with them because of this and and they believe this and you can't do this and you can't do that. I say God, God has raised the standard to where the bride is not walking in fear of denominational spirits, but the love of God is so pulsating in her heart because she knows who he is and what he has done. And she resists that dominate denominational spirit that would want to put walls and fences and barriers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's so good. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes. And notice the scripture here, verse 28, for the law, I love this, maketh men high priests, which have infirmity, weaknesses, but the word of the oath which was since or before the law maketh a son who is consecrated forever more. &gt;&gt; So what what has made him the word for that's who he is? It was the word that was made flesh. &gt;&gt; And so when we're speaking of this, when Paul would write in Hebrews about the blood of Jesus and we speak about the blood being applied to your life, there's no way it could be. There was not enough literal blood to go around. But to understand that blood was shed because it was needed for the remission of sins and the life that was in that blood is what comes to draw upon the worshipper and bring us under the blood in fellowship. &gt;&gt; That is so good &gt;&gt; because outside of the blood there is no fellowship. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So to be fully consecrated to the word by the spirit. This is why Paul would write even in Hebrews 10 that brethren we have boldness in verse 19 to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus. You know the one thing it wasn't Paul it was God moving through Paul. Because when the prophet stood in this age, remember when he was taking beyond the curtain of time and he's standing there, I want you to understand that wasn't just a light thing. When he stood there, he he stands there in that moment and and after it's even been echoed in his to him, it's going to take perfect love to get here. This is what you call perfect love. And remember, the prophet asked this question. He did not ask, will I have to give an account? Will Martin have to give an account? Will Luther have to give an account? Will Wesley have to give an account? Will Pentecost have to give an account? He asked the question, "Will Paul &gt;&gt; be judged?" &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That's very good. &gt;&gt; Listen, you know why? Because every one of those I just named has other messengers are declared to be messengers or stars in the right hand of God because their ministry patterned Paul's ministry. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It's a pattern. God doesn't leave us open and say, "Well, you know what? Just create a new pattern now. Just create a new pattern." That's where Listen, man does that when they're not brought in contact with the Holy Spirit. But the Holy Spirit does not leave us up to drawing our own patterns or what's acceptable. You and I cannot even conjure up or come up with what's acceptable. Listen to me now. The prophet in this age did not come up with what was acceptable. But God took a man who was ordained for this position and his eyes were open to see beyond emotion, see beyond church doctrine. He was lifted up into the heavenlies to behold Jesus [Music] &gt;&gt; beyond denominational ideas &gt;&gt; beyond the isms of man. &gt;&gt; I say who did that? The Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; It was Christ himself that lifted up through that gift that he could see beyond traditions and isms. Well, what about so and so? What about what so and so said? What about what they said? If you're going to a book review, who you going to listen to? Somebody trying to interpret the book or the author? &gt;&gt; If the author is there, you'll say, "I don't have time for this. I can go straight to the source to know what his thoughts were when he was writing this." And that's why Paul met the pillar of fire. And the pillar of fire was greater than any rabbitic tradition. It was greater than the phariseic knowledge. It was greater than any saddism. And what was it? The pillar of fire took Paul clear back to the mind of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's the same thing now in this generation. &gt;&gt; The pillar of fire has returned. That's why we're not referring back to oh so and so. Oh, well so and so. The pillar fire has taken us back to the mind of God. Taken us back to the doctrines of the apostles and the prophets. Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone. It bypass seminaries, bypass denominationalism. Why? You're not being called to be consecrated to become a a member of a church. &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why, well, I'm a message believer. What makes you a message believer? &gt;&gt; Well, I have pictures. &gt;&gt; They have pictures in Washington, DC. &gt;&gt; Others have pictures. &gt;&gt; Well, I have books. There's men who don't even want to stand for this word. They have these books. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; In their ministerial libraries. That's not only makes you a message believer, but what makes you a message believer is Christ himself declaring that you have received the message and the message has been made known in your heart by the Holy Spirit. It's the Holy Spirit that makes the difference in your life. It's not because I can talk the jargon, not because I can hit certain phrases, cliches, and make things and fit this in. That's not it at all. Oh, it's because I can tie this and tie that. Remember Judas, the prophet said, was a preacher second to none. &gt;&gt; The man had a ministry. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Judas wasn't a fly by night. Judas wasn't somebody standing up and serving Campbell soup. This guy could preach. Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's why that even when Paul would write, "Though I can understand all mysteries." &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Many will come to me on the day, did I not prophesy in thy name?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Oh my. So notice when all of this is is is the Lord Jesus who is being exalted here. So when Paul would write of this even in Hebrews 1, in Hebrews chapter 1, it says, "God who in sunundry times and in diverse manners spake in times past unto the fathers by the prophets." So how did God speak to the fathers? By the prophets. &gt;&gt; And why did God send a prophet? God sends a prophet to call him back to the word. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to understand, brother Brandon says they had the law, but they didn't have the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; What is the word of the Lord? It's God's minds, God's thoughts. It's the revelation of the spirit that comes to make this live. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; And bring the people into that place with the word that God has ordained it to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Samuel, what are you saying? I'm saying when the word of the Lord has come through and by the prophet, it overrides reasoning. &gt;&gt; That's right. It sure does. &gt;&gt; You're not serving God by reasoning. &gt;&gt; If you're serving God by reasoning, it's dangerous, friends. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's to be outside of the veil. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm a pretty good guy. Hey, the rich young ruler was a real good guy. &gt;&gt; He stood right in the presence of the word himself, and the word himself couldn't even put a finger on his life. He said, "I've kept every one of those ten commandments." &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; But he lacked something. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? It's more than just, well, I have this down. I have that. But it's got to it's got to come to a place, you know what? At least that young man, he was honest enough to admit, I'm lacking something. What I need is eternal life. I need something to make this word live inside of my life. Amen. &gt;&gt; But when the word came to honor his honesty and touched his life, &gt;&gt; it was too much. &gt;&gt; It's too much. &gt;&gt; I have to cut this. Oh, I have to get rid of this. The Bible said he walked away &gt;&gt; sorrowfully &gt;&gt; because he had great possessions. &gt;&gt; I say this to you. I wonder how much his possessions meant when the Bible says he lifted up his eyes in hell. &gt;&gt; Cuz you know what? You can't take any possession with you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something, friend. Hell is a real place. &gt;&gt; It was It was made for the devil and his angels. It was not made for any any human being. &gt;&gt; You say, "Why will human beings be there?" Because they've rejected &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't choose what parts of him you can. What parts you want to receive. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's like a person that gets married simply because the man's got a good paying job. &gt;&gt; That's false. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You didn't marry him. You married his money. Are you hearing me? Well, well, I love the Lord Jesus. But what what do you love about him? Because if you don't love his word, if his word is, well, I you don't need him. We don't need to do this or we don't need to do that. Then something about it, you're wanting to be married to him and even to claim that, but yet not really wanting him, but wanting some of his attributes. Oh, I want his grace. I want his mercy. But do you want him? &gt;&gt; That's so good. &gt;&gt; I don't want to be tied down. I don't want I don't want to be having children and where the word bringing forth in my life and separating me from who I am and and I don't want that kind of a life. I want to be free. &gt;&gt; It depends on what your definition of free is. &gt;&gt; I'm as free as I can be this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; But I can tell you, I was a man prior to June of 1995, there was a man that was bound. &gt;&gt; Could not get free. Tried, but could not get free on my own. But when he came, &gt;&gt; that's right. &gt;&gt; I've never been ashamed. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I say that because of him. I'm not ashamed of him. How could I be ashamed of him for what he has done for me? &gt;&gt; You know, Jesus said, "If you're ashamed of the Son of Man and his words in this generation, he'll be ashamed of you." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, it doesn't cost you anything. Even as young people, it doesn't cost you anything. you you'll not get you'll not get you'll not get anything thrown at you any tomatoes when they ask you where do you go to church if you said I'm a Baptist or I'm a this okay they they know that &gt;&gt; but when you say well we follow the revealed word of the hour &gt;&gt; and God has sent a prophet in this hour uhoh now &gt;&gt; you're getting off your rocker &gt;&gt; you know what's happening you're now being faced with an with with a put will Do you bear the reproach from this word? &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; You see the what it is is that it's comfortable to be identified with dead religion, but when it comes down to the living God, that's where it gets uncomfortable. &gt;&gt; Thou being a man maketh thyself God. &gt;&gt; The Pharisees were comfortable in their religion. And the prophet said they didn't know the God of Moses. They only knew the history of the God of Moses. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, it's got to be more than knowing the history of the God that worked in William Brandham. But the same God that worked in William Brham is the same God that wants to work inside of your life. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Don't make this message. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Well, we're going to get somewhere here. In Hebrews 1 at sunra spake unto the fathers through the prophets hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of all things by whom also he made the worlds. You could go on and read that when he says by his son listen the body has already went on &gt;&gt; but his son that pillar of fire is still here. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Because it was not the flesh body that created the worlds. Ephesians chapter 2, who created all things by Jesus Christ. Who is Jesus Christ? The word. Who is his son? The word. &gt;&gt; Right? John picks that up. When we're talking about the Son, we're talking about the word. When we're talking about the word, we're talking about God. We're talking about the spirit. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The body there, the body has been raised up. But who is it that came and gathered the disciples and imparted himself on the day of Pentecost? It was the son of God, &gt;&gt; the Holy Spirit, their inheritance being dispersed to their life. The coming of the Holy Spirit falling on this one, on that one, on this one, on that one, quickening them &gt;&gt; into the body. &gt;&gt; And he's speaking through your life. He's still speaking. And you know what? He's not speaking a new message. &gt;&gt; This message that God sent to you and I, it's not a new message. &gt;&gt; It's a restoration message. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Some of you that go to some of these car shows, you know this well enough. Some of you could look at this car and think, "Wow, they used to have it at Osborne Park in Sunduski. Wow. Ain't that ain't that really nice? Open that Ford. Show me what kind of an engine. Well, what is it? It's a Chevy engine. &gt;&gt; That's not a restoration. A restoration is restore it back to its original with every original part, including even the doorork knobs. &gt;&gt; God has not left this up to man to patch this and patch that and patch this and patch that. The bride is not a patchwork a bride. She is a bride that is made up with the elements that went out of his side. The blood, the water, and the spirit. She is a bride that is made up word on top of word on top of word on top of word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's so good. &gt;&gt; Well, they don't have this certain part down at the part store. Well, let's find somebody who does. &gt;&gt; That's so good. Maybe you've got to go to somebody's junkard, what they classified as junk. &gt;&gt; We don't need this oddlooking stone. &gt;&gt; We don't need this cornerstone. Who put that oddlooking stone in here? But you what you find down there in that junkyard, you find something that is precious and it fits back in with the restoration. It's not what man calls foolish. What man calls great, God said it's foolish. Amen. &gt;&gt; My I haven't even got beyond the title slide here. &gt;&gt; This is why Paul would write, "We've been called to Mount Zion." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A blood that speaks better things. This blood is speaking. What What is it that's speaking? the chemicals, all of that that comprised of his blood. God created that blood. That blood went back down in the ground. But the life that was in that blood, God's own life, that life has become the blood. &gt;&gt; And it is the life that is calling out to you and I. Don't stay away. &gt;&gt; There's fellowship. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; There's reconciliation. &gt;&gt; That's right. Now when we come into this here of being fully consecrated to the word, I want you to see how that within it. Remember when Jesus came to Nicodemus, he said, let me just refer to this, except a man be born of the water and of the spirit. He can in no wise enter. So there's a way to enter into fellowship with God. The water by the word, &gt;&gt; right? coming by the word, it'll lead us in into that into water baptism. The water being the word, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; See the now and the spirit. So, no way to enter in, but by the word and the spirit. So, not just the spirit because listen now, I can't get all the way into this here this morning, but you can read Leviticus 8 when you you get home. The priests were not anointed. And I'm talking about Aaron's sons until the blood had been applied. The anointing did not go upon them until the blood was applied. This is why the spirit of God only comes to a heart that's taking that word. &gt;&gt; See, it's not something, oh, it's just an osmosis. It's just, no, no. God has a provided way. If we come to we come unto God by him. So to take to take that word, the Holy Spirit cannot come until the word's been applied. But let me just say this to you. The word can be applied so quickly, so simply. The prophet even says it like this. He says, "God can come right in this service while the word's being preached and a person can move right through justification, sanctification, and baptism of the Holy Ghost just like that." &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? So, we're not trying to set up a timeline. We're just all of this that we read in our text. It all is speaking of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? So now as as he would bring them here and let me just try to move into this place coming coming to this this part of it that when the priests were brought here um let me refer back pull this up again when God spoke to Moses of what to say to Aaron everything that was brought the garments Aaron didn't make his own garments &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; God made them and they were made by the wisdom of God. Yeah, &gt;&gt; those garments would reflect God, would reflect his nature, &gt;&gt; would reflect his humility, would reflect his righteousness. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So, it wasn't Aaron bringing to God what he thought was necessary. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; God has given this declaration through Moses to tell Aaron and his sons. God said in Numbers three, I'm going to take all of the the tribe of Levi unto myself rather than the firstborn of the children of Israel. They they'll redeem it, but I've brought all that of Levi unto me. God speaking of how that he would take even unto himself, even from among the peoples, an elect predestinated royal priesthood, a chosen generation, and God would bring us to himself for what purpose? to serve his will. &gt;&gt; That's right. Right. &gt;&gt; I want you to think of this here. These priests when Aaron and his sons came, they did not nor did they have the ability to consecrate themselves. Just listen to me for a few moments. It was done by another. &gt;&gt; That's good. Moses was standing in thestead of God. But Moses was not standing there as though it was Moses consecrating him. It was the word of the Lord that Moses had surrendered himself to. So it was the word coming through the prophet that would actually initiate and bring them through and into consecration. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's good. He was God's representative. So all this speaks of the redeeming work of Christ from the sacrifice, the clothing to the anointing oil that sat on the priest in the service because to worship blood was required through a sacrifice to enter. You you can't worship without there being a sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? God set said set all the requirements and he would be the one that would ultimately fulfill them. Jesus would say no man come unto the father but by me. &gt;&gt; Right? He would say I am the door of the sheepfold. &gt;&gt; If any man enter by me, &gt;&gt; he shall go in and out and find pasture. &gt;&gt; Right? He said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life." Jesus was revealing who he was. He was and he still is the I am that I am. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; No man can come unto the father unless come unto me unless the father draw him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You see, even in all of this right here, to have that that that that beauty that stands out before us, I think of where my dad would, you know, my dad, I would be sitting on the the couch and this is, you know, I was going through some real rough times in my life and uh so forth and just, you know, it's just so intertwined with the things of the world and things, you know, as just a young man and 17, 18 years old and so forth. And I remember him looking at me, you know, and no doubt I don't know how many sleepless nights and how he cried him and my mom and all those other things cuz you never want to see your your your child just being just taken away seemed like and and through the through the the confines of life and and so forth. And he would look at me and he said, "Son," he said, "Do you believe this message?" I said, "Dad, absolutely I believe this message." And he would he would lower his head and he said, "No, you don't. because if you did, you would live it. &gt;&gt; That boy, you know what? I knew what he was saying. I knew he wasn't putting me down, but I knew what he was pointing out is that when you say you believe something, it won't just something come from here. It'll come out of here. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. &gt;&gt; You understand me? That's why the prophet in unveiling of God, he says it's got to be more than just something we say we believe it, but it's got to be Christ identified in us. And you know what? When you believe it, unbelief flees from your life. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; Hey, Bri, you need you need things the way God works to get lives cleaned up. But don't just focus on little things here or there. You focus on him. He's the one that'll take care and clean the things up and direct you in your life and give you the power that'll break every spirit. &gt;&gt; Let me just tell you, fashions are not just something. They're devils. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Habits are spirits. &gt;&gt; Come on, friends. I'm not throwing off on anybody. I'm telling you, you got to call it for what it is. That's why you when you can't get free of something, it's a spirit. &gt;&gt; We don't need flesh and blood. Flesh and blood cannot take care of it. A spirit must be cast out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the preaching of the word is here to bind the Satan. &gt;&gt; What's tormenting the mind, tormenting the life, hindering and wanting to keep a hold and oppressing and tormenting. But the gospel is the good news to say you are free. &gt;&gt; But you've got to act on it. Amen. &gt;&gt; You've got to want to be free. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; To be fully consecrated to the word by the spirit. Consecration is an action. It's an action. This word, it's an action of making something sacred. Ordaining someone or to consecrate is to ordain someone to a certain office. Now, I want to just pick this up here. The Bible says that Moses brought Aaron and his sons and he washed them. I want you to just stay with me here just a moment. He washed them. And when Moses as he came and he brought Aaron and his sons, all of the congregation, all of Israel is beholding this before the door of the tabernacle. So what what's being done is before they can ever enter in even into the tabernacle, before they can even enter in, it all starts. This is part of the entering in is submitting to the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; See, God's laying down a a type of what will be fulfilled as the Holy Spirit has been poured out in redemption. This whole chapter, friends, speaks and brings us clear through the clear through the church ages. But I want to just deal with this part here in verse six. And he washed them with water. And notice when he he washed them with water, God spoke this. But I want you to hear I want you to listen to me. It would require Aaron and his sons to be able to hear personally what God had spoke to Moses. &gt;&gt; Because secondhanded revelation will never bring submission. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because revelation deals with the heart. You see, it's why you try to when I'm trying to talk somebody in and I I I know that many times as we we work and you labor and we work to disciple and we should but to always remember this that it is not by words that we're going to persuade people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not by words that you'll get them into position. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; There's good things with Bible studies and all that and I I've done that. I believe in that. But I want you to understand it's a condition of the heart. The heart, the Bible says, he that hath an ear, let him hear. &gt;&gt; Not somebody else and tell him what he heard. &gt;&gt; But God through a prophet in this age, he told you as as Moses was telling Aaron and his sons, this is what's to this is what's to be. And he brought all that was needed there to consecrate them. You know what Aaron and his sons had to do? They had to believe it. &gt;&gt; And to simply, as Paul says in Romans 12, to simply present themselves there before the before Moses. Moses representing the word. Is everybody with me? &gt;&gt; Moses, I'm not talking about a man where a man is washing you in. Well, let's see if you'll fit our doctrine. Let's see if you'll fit our thinking. This is not this word is not a man-handled word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God never come to make a bunch of branomites. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Thunderites or whatever more, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Peruites or thisite or this or this or thisite. Those itites happen when Satan gets in there. &gt;&gt; Satan's eating. The prophet says that he says Satan is interested in establishing his own image in the people. &gt;&gt; But the real ministering of the word by Jesus Christ through a faithful minister is not that you become little Samuels. I don't want you to be little Samuels. &gt;&gt; I want you to be real Christians. Amen. &gt;&gt; Bloodbought, word solid, spiritfilled, walking with the seal of the living God upon your life. Little &gt;&gt; Messiah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you're only known by this church, you're living beneath your privileges. &gt;&gt; You can't hide, friends, behind a title. You can't hide behind a ministry. You can't hide behind pictures. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? That's why the Holy Spirit searching us out. He's not here to condemn. He's here to draw us out. Come out here where I can wash you. &gt;&gt; From what? Yourself. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Wash you from all your thinking. Wash you from all your previous ideas. Wash you from behold of sin upon your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How are we washed? by the washing of water &gt;&gt; by the word. &gt;&gt; They come here and Moses happened to watch this. Listen to me. This is why it's very important. And I'm going to just say some things here. You might say, "Brother Sammy, this is your own personal belief maybe." So, but I don't believe someone steps out of preaching in a Baptist pullpit and starts preaching in a message pullpit &gt;&gt; because they may not even be called to do that. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? You say, "What has to be made?" Got to be made a search for qualifications first of all. &gt;&gt; But the other part of it is they may not be ordained for that. &gt;&gt; But let's just say they are. What's important is is that set in the word until you and the word have become one and it's washed you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen friends, he's still changing us. But no man should stand up here unless he's met God face to face. And he knows where he's standing because the message of the hour will always elevate Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; The message of the hour never came to mix Pentecostalism. No. &gt;&gt; It never came to mix church of Christism. &gt;&gt; It never came to me mix baptism. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; The message of the hour is the pure unadulterated word of God by divine interpretation. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the word that God promised in this hour cuz there's a bride &gt;&gt; to be dressed in resurrection garments. &gt;&gt; And before she can have on those resurrection garments, she's got to be washed. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why this message, I want you to think now. Don't let it be disjointed. Think about the scriptures I've just touched with you in Hebrews. &gt;&gt; Who is this? This pillar of fire, the blood of Jesus, the spirit of God, the son of God, the Holy Spirit. It's God. God's own life. Who is this Melzdc? Who is this that has come down? &gt;&gt; Who is this that's washing you and I? Who is this that's separating you, separating us? It's not us. Listen, I believe that we make declarations and when God deals with your heart, you should separate from unbelief. Well, I'm just going to wait till God takes it out of my heart. He's trying to &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't be lazy. &gt;&gt; Good. I'm I'm standing on your word. I no longer want this in my life. Whether it's makeup, whether it's fashion, whether it's less, whatever it is, I no longer want this in my life. You're taking your stand with the word. &gt;&gt; And you watch the Holy Spirit. He's the amen to the word. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm still battling with this. It's not his fault. &gt;&gt; I'm not saying that to put anybody down. You understand what I'm saying? I know it's going to get hot and thick. We maybe need to buckle up for just a moment. But I'm trying to let you know you're not helpless. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If God be for us, who can be against us? [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; I mean, here, what if Moses, he lets us be known? And let's say, let's say here's the door. They're to come to the door. Who's the door? The word. Maybe Aaron and them come there and they look his sons. My man, that's that's some nice water you got there. &gt;&gt; That's some good water. It doesn't matter how it does not matter how much Aaron and his sons could talk about the water. &gt;&gt; You know who made that water possible? Let's move ahead to the antitype, the Lord Jesus Christ. You know who made it pos possible that you and I could be washed thoroughly cleansed? The Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; It wasn't good enough just to look at it and think, "Wow, that's wonderful. Wow, that's beautiful. My, that's nice." It was meant to get into, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Like the man who was bound with the infirmity. He couldn't get to the water, &gt;&gt; but the one who sent the angel &gt;&gt; came to him. &gt;&gt; He brought the virtue of the water to him. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Yes. &gt;&gt; So here, Aaron and his son. But you know what? Listen to me now. &gt;&gt; Before they could be washed, they had to be stripped. There's nobody in here takes a bath wearing, you know, go into bath with your clothes on. &gt;&gt; You got to be stripped. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm using words, you know, I'm using right down the scripture and message terminology. &gt;&gt; The prophet brings it on down and he brings us in in this. I want you to listen this. He said, notice the dressing of this high priest before he could enter the veil. He had to be stripped and dressed right to go in. That's what the church today needs is a stripping off of all these little cults and things and dressed in the righteousness of Jesus Christ and ready to enter in. That's the same for every priest, every son and daughter of God. We must be stripped. Right? &gt;&gt; Now, let me just tell you something. &gt;&gt; Moses was a gentleman. The word is a gentleman. &gt;&gt; Moses didn't sit there and rip their clothes off of them. &gt;&gt; But you know what happened? Faith cometh by hearing. &gt;&gt; They had to have faith in the word that they were hearing that this word itself and what it was calling them to as waters of separation to separate from unbelief. and they had to be willing to stand there and be stripped in order to be washed. Now, let me just let me give you a few examples here. Moses, here he comes. He has he's he has so much theology, so much ambition. My what a what a wonderful young man. Listen friends, the young people this message wonderful. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not just saying that. I mean that. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Well, sure. Well, you don't you don't know this. You don't know that. Well, I I I just choose not to look at the hinder parts. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Sorry. I'm not up on the mountain with Balam. I'm down in the camp with the pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; Don't mean to be sarcastic, but Paul was sometimes. &gt;&gt; You see, it just depends on where you're at. If you're up there seeing everybody's faults, come away from Balum. &gt;&gt; Come away from Balum. Balamism is trouble. &gt;&gt; The doctrine of Balum is trouble. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; You got to get down in the camp where the pillar of fire and there is a power in order to cover sin and deal with sin. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? That's why even as a congregation, we're not sitting here ignorant that there's not problems and issues here. But you've got to be locked in to know there is one that is here among us that's able to deal and settle every situation. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You've got to be settled on that. Look unto Jesus. &gt;&gt; You need help with your young person. You need help my home. I need help here. I need help here. Look to Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh God, I pray that's who has set before us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Here is Moses and God said, "Take off your shoes. &gt;&gt; I don't even want anything between your feet and the ground." The prophet said, "I want your feet on the ground." &gt;&gt; He had to strip down. &gt;&gt; You know, Moses was being stripped of his theology. &gt;&gt; Those 40 years, his ambition was being stripped from him. &gt;&gt; God allowed all that time walking around, walking around, walking around. Right? &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something, friends. Let me say this to you. God won't fight with nobody. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; God won't fight with nobody. He waits till you finally get tired of trying to do it yourself. &gt;&gt; And when you get tired of doing it yourself, he'll say, "I've been here the whole time. &gt;&gt; I've been watching over you the whole time. &gt;&gt; I'm going to let nothing touch your life. Nothing can pluck you out of my hand. But just because you're written in my hand doesn't mean you can bypass the process. You still got to be washed by the word. And it's because you are an elected of God. You will long to be washed by the water of the word. &gt;&gt; Cuz the rest of churches and everything else, I don't need to do that. &gt;&gt; That's not necessary. &gt;&gt; Oh, God looks on the heart. He does. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And whatever's in the heart will come out. &gt;&gt; Come on, friends. &gt;&gt; Moses had to be stripped of his own ideas. &gt;&gt; He had to be loosened. And let me just say this. The Bible tells us in Hebrews 4:12, everybody all right? that the word of God is sharper, more powerful than any sharp two-edged sword. It it it cutting us under, dividing them bone from the moral, and we stand naked before him. &gt;&gt; There is no, in other words, there's nothing hidden from him. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Do you understand when the word is revealing and what we're seeing in our own lives, you don't want to just walk out of here and think and reason away. Don't allow the enemy to reason away. But everyone should come to such an effectual part in your life. God, I want to be more like you. My my life has been searched. I don't want to just look in the mirror and walk away and be talked out of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Moses had to be stripped. He had to get to a place to where he had no ability that he could rely on. You know, Joseph, Joseph had to be stripped. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, you might say, "Well, Joseph, he he was perfection." That's true. That type stays where it's at until we get off of it. &gt;&gt; All right? You got to know when to get on and get off, &gt;&gt; right? But the prophet tells us that Joseph felt like he was a great guy. &gt;&gt; See what it was. He could say, "Oh, no. I don't feel that way." But he was letting it linger. And God saw him entertaining that. He saw where that was at. He felt like he was a great guy. And God allowed him to get to a place, the prophet said, until he seen himself as nothing but a total failure. &gt;&gt; And when he said he got to that place and brother Bam stands out and says, "Glory, a total failure." Amen. &gt;&gt; Then the remembrance came. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; To the man who had held the cup whose dream had been interpreted by Joseph. &gt;&gt; His failed me, king. This has just come back. You know why? It was his time. &gt;&gt; See, God has everything in time. It wasn't like God was just waiting around. Come on. Come on. The wine. The wine guy. Come on. Come on. Come on. God was working on Joseph. God works on both ends. Yes. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? God works on both ends. &gt;&gt; Yes, he does. &gt;&gt; And when Joseph was was ready, &gt;&gt; that's right. &gt;&gt; He comes out of the dungeon, it's made known. &gt;&gt; He shaves himself. He's washed and he puts on different garments. Why? He's getting ready to go before &gt;&gt; Pharaoh. That's right. &gt;&gt; See, the washing and the changing, getting ready to go before someone, it's part of the approach. Same thing with Ruth. When God spoke through Naomi to Ruth, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; remember she told Ruth, "Before you go down to the boyas, wash yourself. &gt;&gt; Get all that stuff off your face. &gt;&gt; Get all that stuff out of your life." &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Come on, friends. &gt;&gt; Clean up and put raignment on and go down to the foot of the cross. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, does Paul, where was Paul? Paul was coming. Paul had everything down, man. He was a Pharisee of the Pharisees. He had everything right down to the line. He Paul could set it all out there, been taught by Gilia, and yet he was persecuting, standing against the very one that he had read about, &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; he could quote scriptures about, but because his eyes were not opened. But there on that road to Damascus when his eyes became opened, &gt;&gt; let me tell you what opened his eyes. That pillar of fire, God coming down, Paul was on a mission &gt;&gt; to arrest and persecute more to the death. &gt;&gt; But God intervened. &gt;&gt; And when God intervened in Paul's life, Paul at that moment, and I quoted it to you at the beginning, who art thou, Lord? He said, "I'm Jesus whom thou persecutest." &gt;&gt; What happened to Paul? Paul was willing, now watch when this revelation struck Paul's heart. &gt;&gt; Paul was willing to turn loose of where he had been tied to. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He said, "What would you have me do? Go into a street called Straight &gt;&gt; and it'll be told you what to do from there." &gt;&gt; His eyes scaled over. And God has a man by the name of Ananas. Yes. &gt;&gt; And he tells Ananas, "Go lay your hands on him &gt;&gt; that his eyes be healed. &gt;&gt; They be opened, right?" &gt;&gt; And that he received the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; See, that moment where he met the where he saw the pillar of fire, that was not when Paul was filled with the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; That's when it became absolute. That's when it became pearl of great price. He's willing to sell everything and become yolked to this. See, God reveals himself. God makes himself known. And that's why blessed are your eyes. Blessed are your ears that hear. And when you can see, hey, he's worth it all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you can see it's him and you're willing to let go, it's not God taking this and God ripping this and God ripping this and God ripping this and God's ripping this out and God's ripping this out. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God's not a monster. &gt;&gt; It's not him ripping anything out. All right. &gt;&gt; It's where him revealing himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And as you recognize him, it loosens. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a loosening. There's a confidence. Listen to me. That comes through the washing of water by the word. It washes your conscience. &gt;&gt; It comes to It comes to to separate you. It comes to draw you unto himself. It comes to loosen. And you know what? It's not a fight. It's a letting go. &gt;&gt; It's a letting go. Now, &gt;&gt; I know we always want to we always want to come back to the Jacob wrestling, and that's true. But who was Jacob really wrestling with? Well, he was wrestling with the angel of the Lord. No, no, no. Think deeper. Who was he really wrestling with? &gt;&gt; Himself. &gt;&gt; Himself. That's what it is. And when Jacob got tired of being Jacob, that's when victory came. That's right. &gt;&gt; God leads us to a place to where we're tired of being us. You know what? I'm tired of this. I never forget. I stood in Brother Bill's basement and my you know, I I I just all I could say in that moment, I said, I'm tired of living this kind of life. &gt;&gt; Tired of it. All these the promising this I'm going to be better at this and do this and do that. I'm tired of living this kind of life. Even God was dealing with my heart even even leading up to that time, letting me see certain things about the world. Let me see certain things &gt;&gt; about situations in the world. &gt;&gt; And I would speak to others. But yet be right back out. Be right back. Be right back. Plans for that night. Plans for this. Plans for that. Plans for this. But it's got to come to a place to where we're tired of it. &gt;&gt; Let me just say this to you friends. &gt;&gt; This is not just something if you can, you understand this. You have access to this labor not only as one who is coming into a place to come into fellowship with God and to be washed by the word to be clothed with the garments of the word but you have access that when the toils of life when circumstances of life when you've fallen in a trap when you've made a mistake let me just tell you something one a mistake does not define you. &gt;&gt; Willful sin is so much different than a mistake. Oh, brother Simon, I still feel I have the desire. You'll always have the desire in your flesh. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; The spirit, Galatians 5, the spirit, capital S, lustth against the flesh. &gt;&gt; The flesh against the spirit. &gt;&gt; Now, this doesn't sound like I'm preaching this, but it has to be gone to give that revelation. And it's something from the inside to where you know I'm free. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're God's free man. &gt;&gt; But you still need that washing of water by the word. That's why we're sitting here this morning. It's your the washing of water by the word that comes down and not only will bring conviction and deal with situations in our life, but it's here to loosen us. &gt;&gt; Anybody know what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; You go through life, you journey through life. As you're walking through life, you know what? You you need the cleansing power. &gt;&gt; And you know where that cleansing power comes from? As a dove filled with the spirit of God, it comes from the inside out. You say, "How does that come from the inside out?" By you surrendering to the inside man. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And say, "I'm going to I'm not going to I'm I'm going to stop trying to live out here in the spirit realm and reason it all out and make sense of this and make sense of that. Come back to your God-given ground." Amen. &gt;&gt; So, how do we come how do we come in? I know I just I haven't very got very far here this morning, but I want you to see this. It's a washing of water by the word loosed when Ruth came in there. When Esther came, when Esther before she could go in before the king, &gt;&gt; she had to be washed. All right. &gt;&gt; They even took them for a period of time where they stayed there &gt;&gt; before they would come into that place before they had their night with the king. But when Esther's time came, Esther was unlike the rest of them. The rest of them told the king's chamberlain, which is a type of the Holy Spirit, "We'll take this and this and that, and I'll wear this, and don't you touch and say nothing else." &gt;&gt; You know, I'm quoting scripture. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He was a that that that he was a type of the Holy Spirit, the king's chamberlain, the word, the the the messenger here speaking in that time. But Esther said, "You know what? He wants &gt;&gt; you. Show me the attire &gt;&gt; that I need to go in before the king." &gt;&gt; She, what did she do? Forfeit her rights. &gt;&gt; She surrendered her rights in entering. &gt;&gt; And the king had delight in her. Why? What was it? Was it because of all the garments and everything? My No, she listen. As far as how that many of them smelled Oh, listen to me now. I've got to stand on this point. They all had to pass through a certain ritual of purification. &gt;&gt; They all had the same smell. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; But the difference was one had an odor from her heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. to where it was not just something on the flesh, &gt;&gt; something that was just an anointing that that that fell on Sunday and lasted through a portion of Sunday on Monday and Tuesday, but this was something that was down on the inside of her heart. The Bible said she had a meek spirit. [Music] &gt;&gt; That was the difference. That's where God, that's where King of Azarus, a type of Christ, of Almighty God, he had delight. What was it? It was the &gt;&gt; of her heart. &gt;&gt; He had delight. &gt;&gt; Let's stand now. I want to just say this to you. Brother Brown makes this statement and I want to I want to read this because I want to say to you where the real key is willingness. Willingness. And I think that's pretty clear throughout. I want you to understand this, friends. I'm not here to preach a sermon. I'm not here to try to put something together. But this one thought as we've been dealing with this on a priest through the very life of Ruth. I just gave that scripture. Ruth was brought into that place. Wash thyself. Put on raignment and get down at his feet. Come there all the way through the scripture. But the very thing that was tied to and drawn to is because we're not going in the rapture because we feel the anointing. &gt;&gt; You can have this is listen to me now. This is why the prophet said you can have it the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; every hour of your life and be lost and go to hell. He didn't say that one time. He said that multiple places. And actually, it's said all the way through the message. It's just it's phrased a little different when he's telling people, "Don't hold to gifts. Don't hold to sensations. Don't hold to emotions. Don't hold because I've done this, because I've done that." &gt;&gt; The whole thing is to getting people anchored in the word. That's where the bride is. &gt;&gt; Because that's your place of rest. That's your place of solidness. But when when brother Brown makes this statement that you can have it every hour of your life and still be lost and go to hell is because if it's just out here on the flesh and I'm talking about spirit realm &gt;&gt; that's why the prophet says in Christ revealed in his own word he said you can love God and still be lost. Well, how could I love God and still be lost? Because it's not with his love. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; His love is only penetrated to the spirit and it's just where we're taken with, oh, I love God. Hey, listen. Let me just say this to you. I I I want to say this in the right light. In one way, in one way, in one way, it's almost a breath of fresh air to hear certain things coming out of the White House and to hear certain testimonies, to hear certain things and then you see this, oh, among all these athletes, among all these things, and I don't follow all this, but I want you to understand, I want you to understand this, but it's more than just being enamored with a person. Are you hearing me? I'm not downplaying anything. You understand what I'm saying? I mean, I'll take those things coming out of the White House rather before I'll take the transgender and all the funny business and everything else. &gt;&gt; I'm not trying I'm not I don't want to get in divisive things you but I think we can fellowship as believers. You would at least prefer that over top of the other stuff. But what I'm trying to say is is that if you look look look everything even that's happening right here there's things you find are congealing darkness is pressing and that's why the prophet said that darkness is pressing even all of those systems together and they don't even agree with one another. &gt;&gt; But it's darkness that's pressing it all together. But it's the spirit of God that's uniting his people together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, God has brought us brought us to a place who whosoever would hear his voice, let him come. Let him be washed by this word. Let the word wash him. That's why I say friends, listen. This is why I I say this and I say it over and over. If you haven't, which you should have heard this already and should know this already, this is a message church. This is not a Pentecostal church. This is not a Baptist church. &gt;&gt; What are you What are you saying? I'm saying that the message that we are preaching is the message that God has sent in this end time. &gt;&gt; This is the approach to God. &gt;&gt; It's revealing the path of the blood. How to get to God in fellowship. Thank God that the others that we can know know him as savior. I thank God for that. I listen I don't have no problems with with with that of inspiration pouring over from the lamb's book of life onto the book of life. But listen, I'm not called to preach to the book of life. I'm called &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; to preach to those who are in the lamb's book of life. &gt;&gt; But I'm called to express grace to all. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; I'm called to express grace even to lives that would be on the book of life. Because let me tell you something. Wherever that name is at, they cannot move from one book to the other. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; That's why in our lives, we're not we're not trying to make anybody something or this or that. But listen, you've got a call on your life. It's up to you to respond to that call. &gt;&gt; It's up to me to respond to that call. &gt;&gt; It's up to you to say, "As for me in my house, we will serve the Lord. As for me in my house, &gt;&gt; we will serve the Lord." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To be washed by the water of the word. And then to take the clothing of the word as the prophet says it like this. He says, "I'm trusting him someday. I don't know when for a crowning of my ministry. I've stayed as true as I could be. I don't know what it'll be. I don't know when it will be. Just when he's ready, I am. I don't care. I hope he'll he will crown my ministry of this of letting me take the clothes of the word and dress his bride in the cloth of the word and for his righteousness. So it whatever that dressing of the word that word being being dressed in that you laying aside our righteousness laying aside our ideas and I'll just be honest with you friends even as God brings us and we have stepped even into a place to where the blood's has been applied. The anointing has come and we are filled with the spirit of God. But we find from the working of the Holy Spirit in our life, he's still working to loosen us &gt;&gt; from within. &gt;&gt; Ideas. &gt;&gt; Come on. Some of you know exactly what I'm talking about. Ideas. Sometimes it wasn't even what you heard preached. Sometimes it has been. Sometimes you've you've had what in your spirit realm of how something's been presented in your conscience and it's taken you decades. &gt;&gt; It's not that it took God decades. It's that God's trying to work to get us to just let it go to do what? Burn that old leaven. &gt;&gt; Some some have served God almost with a with a slave mentality &gt;&gt; instead of as a son. &gt;&gt; Oh, if I mess up, he's going to get me. God's not out to get you. &gt;&gt; He is in one way. He was out to get you. He brought the blood to you. &gt;&gt; He was out to get you. He drew you to himself. And he's out to get you to take you in rapture. But he's not out to get you the way that you think. &gt;&gt; He's not against you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's for you. &gt;&gt; And I want to say, Lord, like Peter, wash me completely. And Jesus said once you've been washed you don't need to wash but your hands and your feet &gt;&gt; doings &gt;&gt; goingings &gt;&gt; how often every &gt;&gt; day &gt;&gt; that's why even we come and sit here washed by the washing of water by the word oh how God deals with our life he deals with certain things and what's he doing as we're we're standing with that word and submitting to it that word is bringing separation. &gt;&gt; You just you're sitting right there and you're saying, "Amen." And what's happening? The word, like brother Bram says, "Oh God, may the sword just move through us this morning." Just piercing as the word's being preached and separating us, Lord, &gt;&gt; right in our life, just separating from all unbelief. What's the word doing? It's pressing it back. &gt;&gt; Being washed right where we're sitting and listening to the word. It's just that simple. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just letting it. Let the word wash. Let the word have its way. Lord, separate me from all unbelief. Separate me, Lord, unto yourself. How many say, "Lord, that's my desire." &gt;&gt; I mean that. &gt;&gt; I mean business. The rapture. The rapture is everything. &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. &gt;&gt; I want to be a real son and daughter of God. And I'm not saying that we're not, but I say for every one of us, let that be such an evaluation. If you haven't stayed or stood underneath the word and let the word wash you, I say, "Come." And I want to leave you with this thought. The Bible says whosoever may come, but it didn't say whensoever. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, today is the day of salvation. &gt;&gt; Whosoever, not whensoever. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We don't want to just look at the door and look at the water and just look at the message and oh my, what a wonder get in it. Let the word wash you. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you the word the word will separate you from your anxiety. &gt;&gt; Yes, it will. &gt;&gt; It'll separate you. And I'm not saying you have anxiety because you ain't been washed by the word. Understand what I'm saying? I'm telling you that this word, it will wash you. It'll separate you. &gt;&gt; It's able. It's able to come and put a separation between you and the torment of your past. &gt;&gt; That's the power &gt;&gt; of this word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know why? Because God wants you to be free to worship. &gt;&gt; Let's just pray. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, how we our Lord are so appreciative of your mercy and your grace to us, Lord, right here, Lord, even in this assembly, Lord, as you've touched our lives, our hearts, and you've drawn us, Lord, to to come together and how we thank you for this the fellowship of the Holy Spirit through the word. Oh God, I I thank you, Father, for this living word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, I see nothing but you. That's all I see is Jesus. I just see you, Father. I see you high and lifted up. I see you Lord above every situation. I see you Lord exalted in in my heart above unbelief. Lord we see you father. How we want to say thank you. That's before we even make any request. I just want to say thank you because Lord, like the song that was wrote by inspiration, not even in my wildest dreams that I think I'd see such things &gt;&gt; has the coming of the Lord the rapture mystery. &gt;&gt; Lord God, it wasn't us. It wasn't us that found you. It wasn't us that found this message. It's you that came looking for us. I thank dear God a few weekends ago, 43 years ago, right over here, Lord, at the little YMCA right off of Tower Tower Boulevard was a little man by the name of James Browning would have a burden, Lord, upon his heart that yet he's not the one who rented that place another did. But Lord God, you used and worked through him within that meeting on that Labor Day weekend where hearts were restored back to the Lord that had fellowshipped under this message. Oh, they weren't out in the world running around. No. But Lord God, you drew them. And at that same meeting, I think of different ones like Sister Joe, Brother Herb, different ones, Lord, that were drug dealers, things throughout this city and you touched their hearts. Lord God, this work is not the work of a man. You raised this up, Lord. You didn't split it. You raised it up. It's your work. It's not a man's doing. Yet, Lord, you've worked through man. And it's been your word. A word, Lord God, that you would send, Lord God, to bring people not to where it would just reflect a man. Lord God, I don't want my image. I know my dad, Brother Browning, he never wanted his image to be reflected in people. Lord God, we've ran across that. We've seen that sometimes Lord certain things you can get around and you start listening and you'll start hearing certain phrases being said and these phrases and all of a sudden and then you start watching closely and then it'll become almost like exclusivity and you realize wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute we're called to freedom not to be excluding but to freedom in Jesus Christ. But Lord, I want to say thank you. I want to say thank you. Thank you for this word that you've sent, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord God, thank you Lord for the message to be preached in purity, in power, and a demonstration. Thank you, Lord God, for each and every one of the gifts that you've allowed us to bring right through here, Lord, and be a blessing to us as an assembly. I thank you, Father, for the burden that you placed there, Lord, upon my dad's heart, Lord God. I I thank you, Father, for this word. Thank you, Lord God, for sending the prophet in this hour. But Lord, if my thanks was just limited to that, it still would not be to the degree of thanks that we should have. But Lord God, the greatest thanksgiving and way of thanks is to surrender ourselves to you, Lord. Lord God, it's more than talking about the past. It's more than talking about the pastor, more than talking about the prophet. But Lord God, it's to really get under the blood and get in fellowship with you. It's more than being associated with a church, Lord God. There should be a real association with you through and by the new birth. Lord God, may every young person, Lord, that's in here, Lord Jesus, there'll not be any rapture, there'll not be one go in the rapture without the Holy Ghost. And Lord, I pray as each one, Lord, as we've looked here in the scriptures and just Lord, not even getting into that place yet, but to know that God, there is a a process that you move through for the anointing to come upon our lives. Lord Jesus, you sent a word in this hour, Lord, to break the confusion. Even that statement I made moments ago, Lord God, that your prophet would make in those last few messages before he left the scene about having the Holy Ghost every hour of our life and still be lost and go to hell. That statement, Lord, is a som sombering statement and it should sber us. It should sober hearts, Lord God, but sobering to a place, not to where that it's left open to where we're somehow talked into a corner because Lord, the devil can never take from us what you've given to us. He can never break that seal. But the Lord, the coming of the Holy Spirit was more than just to be an anointing, Lord God, that we would even be under and cry and say, "Thank you, Lord." It was more than just an anointing that would make us, Lord, just for a season of time, just Lord, to be better. But Lord God, the anointing was meant to go to that soul and change the desire to where it's not just something, Lord, that we're just coming upon us and leaving, coming upon us and leaving, but Lord God, where the dove abides, it's abiding in our life by the new birth. Lord, I pray I pray God for each one. Lord, you know, I've not said these things even here this morning to be harsh, to be crude. If I have, I need to be at the altar. But Lord, I've said it from my heart, Lord, as you would lead me. I want to see each one walking in the inheritance that you have for them, Lord God. that Lord Jesus were every lie that the enemy would want to hang over, every reasoning or anything Lord that would want to hinder them or keep them back from the real life of God. Lord, a life like your prophet said, a priest of God, spending our lives in your service, worshiping you in spirit and in truth, interceding and petitioning, offering up spiritual sacrifices from the fruit of our lips. Lord, help us. May each and everyone, Lord, everyone, every one of us, Lord, I pray God, if there's one here this morning that's just, Lord, God looked upon the message, but has never come to a place to really stand and let the message of the hour, the word of God, wash them. Grant it, Lord Jesus. May they see May they see you. That's what I pray, Lord. I pray out of this service they've seen you Lord seeing that it's your desire Lord wasn't Moses his idea to Aaron and his sons but it was your word and they submitted to it grant it Lord I pray right here this morning may you Lord God I pray just drawing every heart and every life Lord into full consecration Lord continue to speak to our hearts Lord even Lord as this service Lord and at some point, Lord, that the last song will be sung, the last note will be played. But I pray, God, may the word that's been spoken, may it resound in our hearts. Even when we would leave out of here, Lord God, may the word keep on moving, Lord, and keep penetrating. Keep dealing with lives and hearts, Lord God. For Lord, we're living in a very late hour, Lord God. We're living in a place, Lord, we can't stand on our own works. When they came before that door, they had to be willing to be stripped of their own righteousness. Nothing of our rags of what we could do, but it's to accept your righteousness, Lord, to let ours down and be washed. And then after the washing, we can be clothed. Oh God, help us, Lord. Help us, Lord Jesus. You know every need that's here this morning. Maybe there's one, Lord, that's sick in their body. They've got an infirmity, Lord. Something, Lord, that's plaguing. And maybe, Lord, in their spirit or their mind. Lord God, I pray may the Holy Spirit just go right now, Lord. May the great washing of water by the word just go forward right now, Lord. I pray God as they're they're willing Lord their hearts Lord are open to you Lord this morning Lord may the spirit of God like the great pillar of fire that stood between the Egyptians and that Israelite army God may you just go and stand between them and that sickness Lord that disease that affliction Lord that mind battle Lord God may you minister Lord to them right now I pray grant it Lord fill every heart Lord I pray every heart Lord into that place of a condition that you might feel them. Lord God, bring them to that place of willingness, of surrender. Granted, Lord, I pray and make us, Lord, with my hands up, I ask you, make me more willing, Lord, where the prophet would say in the last part of recognizing your day and its message, he said, "Oh God, let there be a revival come in me, Lord. Lord Jesus, let them make me more willing. Make me, as he said, more humbler, make me more of a servant. Grant it, Lord God, I pray. Help us, Lord, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Go ahead, brother Brian. More. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord Jesus. my love. The more that I release my cares, the more it takes control. The more that I can humble myself, the more he lifts me up. And every day I live, Lord, I love you more. And it gets easier to understand my &gt;&gt; this road down. No more bravery. Oh, wondering. &gt;&gt; I'm standing on solid ground to my future home and the voice I hear is yours. &gt;&gt; Every day I live. Lord, I love you more. Oh, it's the more &gt;&gt; and the lighter. &gt;&gt; Yes, it is the more &gt;&gt; it's the more tasty. Oh, and the more that I can humble myself, &gt;&gt; the more lift me up. Every day I live. Lord, I love you more. &gt;&gt; The problems I had yesterday. Yes, Lord. [Music] So [Applause] are now my &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; To my future home. And the voice I hear is yours alone. Every day. Oh Lord, I love you more. The more I surrender, &gt;&gt; more. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, what a blessing it is &gt;&gt; to have a heart &gt;&gt; with willingness to surrender. Lord, I surrender. The more that I can humble myself and every day, &gt;&gt; oh Lord, I love you more. Remember, brother Brandon standing there in things that ought to be. Think about this washing of water by the word. He begins to speak to us about that going beyond the curtain of time and he says in that things that ought to be he says you know he says used to think he said we'd just be spirits floating by and I'd never be able to shake brother Neville's hand &gt;&gt; right but this is what he says and things that ought to be he says but since the opening of them seven seals &gt;&gt; yes sir We know that's not the truth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You see, the opening of the seals never took anything away from him going beyond the curtain of time, but it only vindicated all the way through and he could see this is a place. And what it did, it made that even that much more clear as the prophet was walking on in my father's house as many mansions theophony. What What are you saying, brother Sam? I'm saying that the prophet as he stood there, he was willing to be washed when he told us, "Don't have a period after what you believe. Have a comma." &gt;&gt; We believe all of this and all that he will continue to reveal. &gt;&gt; The prophet was an example of a believer walking into perfection. Amen. &gt;&gt; That had come through a perfect sacrifice and coming into perfection as the word separating. It's incredible when you used to go and you look how the prophet you just type in the table app. I used to think a lot of things you would find I used to think. Well, who changed the used to think? Because the prophet tells us in the message prisoner God loosened Moses from his previous thinking. Who was it that loosened the prophet from his previous thinking? Hey, he would have been just like you and I. Unless God came and revealed, we'd have still been going by our own thinking. But aren't you glad that God continues to come by your way and my way &gt;&gt; and loosen us from our own thinking. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for that? I am. &gt;&gt; Let me make this comment before we go as well too about that anointing of the Holy Spirit. The difference is when it's just on the spirit, there's still all the desires within that life and it'll all come out still. And that's why brother Bram says, he says, you can take one. He said, they spoke with tongues. And he said, yet they're wearing shorts, they're cutting their hair, they're painting their face and doing all this and run. He said, and you try to tell them they don't got the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; What are they basing it on? The anointing of the Holy Spirit. But look at you. What's different about your life? Even when you're walking maybe tomorrow when you walk up, you wake up tomorrow, you're not going to feel like the presence you feel right here, right? Maybe maybe right now. I know sometimes when we wake up, we do sometimes that happens. &gt;&gt; But but what's difference is is that even when you don't feel his presence, you have the confirmation of his word in your life. Lo, I am with you always. Amen. &gt;&gt; You say, "How do I know that?" Look at the life that's being lived. No matter where you put your no matter where God put you, Daniel was still a believer &gt;&gt; in Babylon. &gt;&gt; You I don't care where you put Daniel, put him in a lion's den, he's still a believer. &gt;&gt; No matter where you put him, &gt;&gt; the situations don't change. You know why? Why is that? It's not because Daniel was some great man. &gt;&gt; It's because there was a great God. &gt;&gt; Amen. who was living according to what could be lived in that hour. And Daniel didn't even have the Holy Ghost like we have the privilege of heaven. &gt;&gt; But he was able to live an overcoming life. &gt;&gt; Aren't you grateful for the grace of God? &gt;&gt; Thankful for God's mercy. It settles us, friends. It settles us. And when we're settled, it affects how we walk in this life. It affects how you approach situations. It affects how even you approach the the mundane tasks of life cuz you're approaching it knowing that you've got all of heaven behind you and you've got a rest and you're in that rest. Don't you love him this morning? &gt;&gt; I know I've kept you here. I've kept you a little longer. I didn't I know now you say we're used to it. But I trust with all of it. I trust. I trust. Oh God, we stand there even now. Lord, may our lives be fully consecrated to the word by the spirit. That's what I want, friends, with all my heart. Lord, if there's something I'm not seeing as I ought to see it, I want to see it the way you want me to see it. I want to see it the way you want me to see it. I want to see myself more clearly the way you see me, Lord. That's that's what I want to delight in. I want to see see myself how you see me. That's what I want to walk in. Don't you love him? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Could we just pray together before we go? Lord Jesus, what a beautiful atmosphere, Lord. Just a sweet, sweet presence. And I know Lord some have had to leave for other appointments and things. May you be with them Lord upon the roads. Others Lord are standing right here. No doubt. I know Lord we get tired. We get weary in our bodies. Many times Lord I know that even in myself Lord I I pay for it in my own body. Oh God. But how we thank you for your presence. We thank you for your word and Lord with every one of our hearts Lord. Everyone Lord that gathered even right here this morning. Those that would Lord have streamed it, those that would archive it. Oh God, may the Holy Spirit just just so pierce every one of our hearts. Lord, that's what you're coming. That's what you're coming back for is a bride who is the word who has become the word by the spirit. Fully consecrated to that word by the spirit. Not by any idea but by you, Lord. That's why our worship daily, our thanksgiving is unto you, Lord. Grant it. Grant every every one of our hearts, Lord, every each and every one of our lives, Lord, we want to walk on. We want to just draw closer to you, Lord. As the song says, let all the things of this world fade away. &gt;&gt; Lead us, Lord God, into even into a a greater surrender. May, Lord, our hearts remain humble. Oh God, may we Lord Jesus just veil ourselves Lord against this against the spirit of the age. Oh God Lord Jesus by taking your word cuz we need you Lord. We need you. You're our life. You're our everything. You're everything to us Lord. You've given us life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're our lifegiver, Lord. [Music] Bless your children, Lord. Give strength to each and every one, Lord. Watch over us on the roads. Be with us through this work week, oh God. And Father, just continue to draw us closer to you, Lord. Oh God, as we're just listening to the message, Lord, and just Lord, getting into the word and just saying, "Lord, speak to my heart, Lord." As we open the Bible, Lord, speak to my heart today, Lord. Give me this day my daily bread. As we're listening to the message, Lord, give me the portion, Lord, that's allotted to me, Lord God. Just draw me closer to you, Lord God. Anything that's between you, Lord, and me. Whatever I've allowed, because it's not you. Whatever I've allowed, Lord, God, reveal it, Lord. Wash it away, Lord. Cleanse it, Lord. I want my heart and my mind to be just stayed upon you. Grant it, Lord, we pray. be with Lord Jesus each and everyone in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. God bless you. Would you shake hands with one another as you're being dismissed? We love you in the Lord. Lord, I give you my heart. Give you my soul. I'll live for you alone. &gt;&gt; Every breath that I take, every moment I wait, have your way in me. &gt;&gt; Oh yes, Lord. This is my desire to honor you, Lord, with all my heart. I worship you for it's all I have within. All I have, Lord, I give you. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; All that I adore is in you, [Music] Lord. I give you my heart. I give you my soul. I live for you alone. Every breath that I take, every moment I'm awake, have your way in me. And this is my desire to honor you. Lord, with all my heart I worship you. All I have within me, I give you praise. All that I adore is in you. Lord, I give you my heart, give you my soul. I live for you alone. Every breath that I take, every moment I'm awake, have your way in me. Oh Lord, I give you my heart. I give you my soul. I live for you alone. Every breath that I take, every moment I'm awake, have your way in me. Lord, I give you my heart. Give you my soul. I live for you alone. Every breath that I take, every moment I'm waiting, [Music] have your way in me. [Music]
