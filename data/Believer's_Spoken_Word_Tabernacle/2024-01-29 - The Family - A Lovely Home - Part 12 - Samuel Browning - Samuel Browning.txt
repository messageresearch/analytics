prayer and let's just let's pray together that the Lord will just just help us to say what needs to be said and to hear amen those things that he would say to us this morning Father what a privilege it is Lord that you have given to us Lord in this hour Lord I think of the scripture Lord where it would say let us have Grace that we might serve him acceptably Lord you have truly given us Grace in this hour Lord you have shown us your way Lord you have made known unto us the path of life and you have given us life oh God God oh no wonder David Lord could write thy loving kindness is better than

it'll have to be you to come and to bring it Lord and we just want you Lord I could think of No Greater privilege than just to be a yielded vessel Lord so may you just take control Lord I'm standing in need of you we're standing in need of you Lord Jesus gr It For Your Glory we pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen you love him this morning amen amen don't you turn and just greet someone and say welcome to the house of God Amen welcome buddy amen if we could let's turn to Psalms 128 and just have a few verses of scripture here that we're going to read and amen Psalms 128 and verse 1 it says a song of degrees now these are Psalms when it these words when it says just song of degrees it's not just words that are just thrown in there these this is one of the Psalms that when Israel would come together to worship there were three times a year three different festivals that they were to come together Passover Pentecost and Feast of Tabernacles and the Bible says that they would come and present themselves before the Lord and so as they were journeying to Jerusalem and we know that even in Jerusalem it's higher Heights remember remember how brother Brandon would always joke around with that he'd kind of tease a little bit and he would talk about the different brothers that were in outside of Tucson and he says now down in Jericho you remember as he says that he said but up at Jerusalem Jerusalem was higher is a city that was that was higher and that was that was even speaking of the the heights of really that that New Jerusalem amen the the spirit of the Living God brings you and I into in Heavenly places but I'm grateful aren't you grateful in our journey with the Lord that our journey is not going down we're going up we're going up up up up in the preview of the Bride we're not going down we're going up up up up up doesn't matter the test or the trial that comes it doesn't even matter the hiccup in the journey we're going up that's right amen if if you stumble get up and keep let's go up let's go up amen so my we let's read verse one then blessed is everyone that feareth the Lord that walketh in his ways for Thou shalt eat the labor of thine hands and happy shalt thou be and shall be well with thee thy wife shall be as a fruitful Vine by the sides of thine house and thy children like Olive plants round about thy table verse four behold that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the Lord the Lord shall bless thee out of Zion and thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life yay Thou shalt see thy children's children and peace upon Israel amen may God bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I just like to continue I thought maybe just to get a little shot in the arm here we it's been um many years as as I used to do and I know uh family services and uh we spoke on the family last week and just filling a burden uh on my heart and I've been praying for quite some time and um I just wanted to kind of uh just felt to go ahead and and take another service here because by God's help I would like to do uh this monthly that's what really the burden is upon my heart uh because I I believe it's such a need um God himself if you'll notice that the lord always makes things very simple for us uh we're living in a time that where when you think of the the message the token uh we realize that the token itself is the Holy Ghost it's God's own life being living in and living out through yielded vessels that speak of redemption and then through all of that remember it's to apply the token to apply that that life that the living reality of Jesus Christ to our lives and then to every situation and everything that we come into we want to invite the Lord Jesus into it you'll never ever go wrong in your life we could never go wrong when we invite the Lord Jesus into our lives and into every situation every decision you'll never be wrong as long as you invite him in that's right I and I believe that it's something that's more than just a symbol I believe it to be a reality when this nation first started they left a chair open at the table and that chair was designated they said said for the Lord Jesus it was to it was to note that what we are doing is under the influence of the holy spirit because remember when we look at at everything I believe that that's where God brings us to is this word in itself we we hear the word uh the message preached uh of a thinking man's filter in this hour and I believe that with all my heart that the word itself is to be the filter in everything that we do we say and we pass everything through it if it won't make it through the word well we don't want it anyhow we just we just want the Lord Jesus we we want him we just want more of him I don't want to have just a little bit I want more of him that that's the only thing that satisfies that in my life amen once you get a taste of the Lord the Bible said taste Taste of the Lord and see that he is good and once you taste of him well you really get a good dose of him you just become compl completely addicted to Jesus you you just become a fiend you can't get enough of him amen it's all about him so we you know that is scripture the Bible says that the bereans the Bible says they addicted themselves to the word of God is that what it says in the book of Acts so I want to just speak here just a few moments on on a lovely home and um we were looking at last week on a Godly order and I want to just bring a few more things here uh this this morning and begin even in the message of of influence and I I want to just kind of preface it don't put that up there yet I want to kind of preface it in this way of that um you know when we're looking at the reality is that the word itself and I maybe I want to give this to you up front and let this be in the centermost part of your mind of the of really the the thought that's really bearing upon my heart is that the word itself that God meant his word to come into flesh and be expressed through flesh remember brother Bram takes it in souls in prison now and he says since Calvary he says he has made us partners with him in Redemption we are co-workers with him this is why let this mind be in you which is in Christ Jesus uh brother Bram says in one place you know in the message divine love in Jeffersonville he says you say brother brandham I pray for The Sinner and brother Bram says well uh you know it's got to be more than that he says do you love them enough to make contact with them do you love them enough to make contact with them and he says it like this do you love them enough to win them to Christ uh that's what divine love is it it goes beyond just praying for him but to win them and I look at there are so many examples that what I I'm trying to get to is that the word itself what God does what he has sent here in the message of the hour that message is no longer just it's not just on books it's not just on tapes that message is living in the hearts of God's people and with that message living in the hearts of God's people we now become responsible that that word that that message that that life would move forward that's so good are so are you hearing me oh yeah so we we don't we we we know there's a responsibility that when we have come in contact with the word of God and I I want to read this this here out of the out of the message influence um brother Brandon says now he says a home he said if we made a home more lovely children wouldn't want to run away make things more for them where they feel welcome and nice and comfortable at home now nowhere if you're reading into this scripture compromise or this quote compromise you're reading it wrong he's not saying bring sin in the home because they're they're unconverted no that's that's not it at all but it's it's there with the love of God in your soul when you when the love of God is burned a passion you know when somebody is passionate about something it is effectual now don't don't confuse passion with fanaticism right not the same thing at all passion is a living reality that where where life they are are so taken and there is there is a an atmosphere that's created it with the love of God is in our heart it it cannot help but to create the atmosphere of life itself is that right I pray God will help me to make this clear of what he's put on my heart brother BR says make things more for them where they feel welcome and nice and comfortable at home where home they can't hardly wait till they get there and that's the way home should be that's good now I want to just say just to start off that the presence of the Lord is what makes the home you you always want your home and your life to be a place that the holy spirit is always welcome amen he's welcome to come at any time which he he want him to be dwelling there but he's welcome in every room in every area and every part in every life he's welcome he's first place and I would say it just in this way right here that as we look at it and thinking about well the presence of the Lord because uh to understand maybe a little bit more where I'm going with this it we you want brother bam brings us down in choosing of a bride and if you catch what he's talking about in that in that time he not only talks about the choosing of a mate but then he also parallels that with choosing a church now we realize that that's all well that's our choice that's right but then brother bam tells us in the message the breach once you've been redeemed you no longer want your own choice so what is he meaning by that is he saying that we don't choose no what it is is Lord I want your choice and when I see your choice that's my choice yes sir that's what I choose so it's it's siding with that and you say is that scriptural well yes because when David was leading the children of Israel before he was ever King he was actually anointed king but it had not come into the place cuz Saul hadn't passed off the scene but when but when David came to that place to where at Hebron those of Israel gathered around David after Saul had passed and said thou was he who led us in and out to battle notice they recognize you are God's anointed all along we've recognized it throughout right and so what were they saying when they were saying we're voting on what God has Vindicated that's that that that's the voting that's the choice I I want to choose what God chooses because he's been my choice I I don't want anything else but him because I know if I choose him and what where God is vindicating and what God says and what God declares for my life when I've got a decision before my home before my life I want to know what does God say about it amen that's what I want to know because whatever he says about it I want his choice because in his choice is life in his choice is where he himself will sustain me and Preserve me he'll keep me he'll bless me he'll guide me he'll Lead Me amen that's what I want so the presence of the Lord is very important and so when we look at that we recognize that the presence of the Lord let me come back to my point that the presence of the Lord is very important the prophet says that you're you the church that you choose to fellowship with and that fellowship with is that it is the presence of the Living God who is there there the word of God is preached in its power and its Authority and Jesus Christ is still alive and well that's the church that's what he says that's what you choose many other things we could say but let me just say this that is wonderful and that is glorious and that is something that we take very seriously but our responsibility does not just stop there with coming to a place where where the presence of God is at where the atmosphere is at it now becomes That Glory coming down in us and now we take that home and we minister to our families so in other words it's not just bring the family to church my what a dynamic service May the presence of the Lord that's only part of it that's only a part of it that's very important it's very important but it's only a part of it so here let's go back to our text in Psalms 128 ver1 blessed is everyone that feareth I want you to notice these two words feareth the Lord that walketh in his ways now that word to fear it means to Revere or reverence not not something to where oh I'm walking I I I'm afraid I I don't I think I think you know God would be I don't want you know I don't want God to be mad I don't want to go to hell that's that's a slavish fear that fear has torment but we're talking about a reverence you say what does reverence look like where you honor his word above your own ideas where you honor his word above your own thoughts where you deny your own reasoning if your reasoning is not with the word deny [Applause] it Hallelujah that fearth is to reverence the Lord how do we reverence him we reverence his word right right we're not just people walking around that in our mind we walk in the imagination of our hearts that well I you know I I just I'm fearing the Lord no there's a way to know that is that is my life lining up with his word right I I I want to make sure I haven't created my own Bible version you know the anatot an I don't know if I'm saying it right however you say that word annotated version you know it and you put your own name there you know I don't want the king SV I don't want the King Samuel version N I don't want that I want King Jesus blessed is everyone that fearth the Lord and that walketh in his ways and that word walk look at this word very very simple word but notice to reverence notice how it comes over into walking which is to go to walk to come to proceed depart move and the man of life and you say well which one is it it's all of it because I don't want to go where he's not at and where he leaves I leave that's the manner of life he he's revealing himself to you and I it's very incredible when you uh look in the message and if you just type the search in that we might know that I that we might know and you find that it's it begins to be stated almost every single C service once the seals have been opened and it is it is an opening part of the prayer Lord may you come and Reveal Your word that we might know how to live and conduct ourselves as Sons and Daughters of God in this hour we no we're not being instructed by by by by the thoughts of a man we are being instructed by our heavenly father when you read of the tutorship in the scripture the holy spirit is not the third person of the godhead the holy spirit is God himself that came down paid the price in the body of the Flesh and came to you and I watch this with fear Psalms 111 verse 10 the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom that's that's the that's the starting point is the fear of the Lord and good understanding have all they that do his Commandments his praise endureth forever Proverbs 1:7 if I go too quick for you and you want want these I'll send them to you the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge but fools despise wisdom and instruction I'm not a fool that's so good verse verse 10 of Proverbs 9 the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom now you know all of those parts when you read that scripture real true wisdom is what comes from above it's pure full of mercy so what is the real wisdom of God it's the Holy Spirit right right because remember that when you have the parable of the foolish and wise virgin the wise had what oil in their lamp they were filled with the wisdom of God for the hour they were living in so to have to the beginning the the fear is the beginning of of wisdom the fear of the Lord Lord is the beginning of wisdom so we start first of all has God even deals with our lives God deals with our hearts it starts first of all with being reverent to his word you realize that doesn't start after a person gets the holy ghost that begins before they ever get the Holy Ghost right many times we put too many things on well when they get the Holy Ghost the everything will just you know just straighten up and and it's true the Holy Spirit comes in but remember he equips you to begin to handle things your life but what he does as the spirit of God begins to move across the life it is what it is bringing us to a place of reverencing the word that's what leads to repentance that's what leads to sanctification and ultimately for the same Grace The Same Spirit more of it coming in that of the baptism of the Holy Ghost so notice and the knowledge of the Holy is understanding now this knowledge this word knowledge it means discernment or perception now I know in the hour we're living in as I said I think last week it'd be very you know we could simply compare ourselves to lady oia and to others out there and say I'm a pretty good guy I mean you know I don't have purple hair or pink hair or green hair or you know a nose ring or I don't have this or I don't have that and you can feel pretty good but that's not discernment discernment is not just what's right and wrong discernment is what's right and almost right right amen that's what discernment is the difference between what's right and almost right notice in verse two well this is verse 2 and three of our text these are results of the man now have you noticed it never said blessed is the woman Yet the woman is blessed is that right a woman I realize sometimes in singlehood and everything else it all applies to our life but when you think of it even as family that how that it would be a blessing and here's the result of it from a man who fears the Lord and walks in his way Thou shalt eat the labor of thine hands why because he's going to be working in continuity with the will of God how can you how can you go wrong when you're working outside of God's will you can't but when you're working in harmony with God's will this is the result of it God said you don't have to worry about the natural I will take care of that as you're lined up with my will right right now that don't mean that you're going to be able to set at home and draw stimulus checks you know spiritual stimulus checks I'll just set at home you know and drink sweet tea and we'll just wait for the checks to come in and you know automatic deposit let me see if something deposited in my account no we're going to have to work we'll have to labor but our works and our labor is not in a way to try to obtain God's favor it is a direct result because we have received and been shown favor from God that's right is that right so now for Thou shalt eat the labor of thine hands happy shalt thou be and it shall be well with thee you realize in that verse right there oh my I got to go on verse three thy wife shall be as a fruitful Vine by the sides of thine house and thy children like Olive plants round about thy table this this is the result of the Simplicity of fearing the Lord and walking in his ways so lovely when we look at that that quote that we were referring to lovely itself is Godly that's what real lovely home it's a Godly home that's what lovely Thou Art altogether lovely his life and this is the reality is is that think about it in the reality if someone were to see you or see me would they themselves be able to see a life filled with joy that's good Oh Brother Sam but you don't know because no amen remember verse one said blessed is he that fearth the Lord and walketh in his ways that's the prescription for real Joy not somebody done somebody wrong song somebody somebody no no listen this is you understand what I'm saying here this morning is that you yourself have a liberty that you can live with real joy in your life where you're not under the control of the thoughts of this or this disappointment or what's going on at work but there is a place and a source of real joy and that place is in Jesus Christ and if you have been birthed by the spirit of God you've got the joy of the Lord in your soul you might go through times of discouragement you might go through times when things don't go your way but you've got a joy that the world didn't give and the world can't take it away this is not not a joy that's man-made this is a joy that's been deposited by God's own life living inside of you that's real Joy it's a strength and a confidence in what we believe in notice brother B goes on in here in the message influence and he says I think today we have such a juvenile crime wave Across the Nation but really he says I think it started in the home I think the parents begin to let go and if the children have been raised up in a good old-fashioned Godly home I don't watch this I don't say it would be all over certainly not but it would certainly give that child the right kind of influence brother Samuel I don't let my C I don't let my children just go everywhere really how far and where do they go on their SM smartphone see this scripture this this quote that I'm preaching right here many of these quotes right here see we can just set right here within that and man I that that don't hit me that don't hit me listen friends we're not here to pick out and pick AA pick apart faults we're here to grow in the grace of God we want the spirit of God to call out Satan's attempted destruction of God's people so to put it in perspective let go is not sharah if they're predestinated it's just let let the chips fall where they may no that's not godly at all God never I'm quoting now in many places in the message your salvation the prophet said was not a halfhazard affair amen God never treated it like that even in dealing with you you realize that's where Calvin got off Calvin got to a place you remember this in the seals brother Bram tells us that Calvin got off because he went too far on eternal security which a truth but he went too far on it where they stopped having revivals they stopped repr preaching the cross they stopped getting out and drawing the people in to where preaching by the word the Bible the word of God is meant to go forth it's meant to be sounded out but instead with Calvin and them they took it to such an extreme well who's ever going to be there is going to be there wrong absolute error is that right there's a truth but that truth would clear out on a limb now notice what brother B goes on to say to me when I'm reading these quotes I'm reading them in my own for my own life and the responsibility amen I think many times that homes that children has been brought up wrong turned loose on the street and just lived for themselves while the mother stays in a barroom and the father and so forth they don't take care of this children now you could read this in a different way maybe you say brother Samuel I don't go to a barroom but if you have your own little cubby hole and your place that I'm just going off and I'll let the rest of the family do whatever you're going off to yourself and God never meant you meant for you to have a family and then to go on autopilot is that right is he not a friend that does what sticketh closer than a brother and if if you say am man it helps the medicine it really helps it go down really helps it go down is that right well brother Samuel do you know they're they're kids you're the adult right think about what God did for you and I God never said well I'm God they need to come up where I'm at no he came down where we were and he came down to such a place the prophet tells the story of the king who came down among his subjects that he might understand us better is right oh I'm glad for that aren't you I'm glad that when I when I go to him when he se's right there he don't say whoa wow what are you talking about Samuel my no he knows because he has had a sensible experience that's what the word tempted means he's been through it aren't you glad for that Hallelujah now notice many times brother B when he has just read this part let's go to the third quote there he says another thing they don't love it and give it the affections to take it up it's young you've got to teach it to love and respect and to read the Bible read the yes sir Lord have mercy isn't there just an update through apple.com may maybe it's message the message.com I'll get an update for there I'll just take my my children I'll take my three boys and I'll just plug them in right there and all of a sudden it'll be the color will turn and sink sink sink sink sink see it don't work that way does it we are that source of connection am as parents in the life we are that Source we are that channel you say the holy spirit is he operates through the agency of man that's right is that right he operates through the agency of man now they might be ever so little they might be this size and this is where that we have to pray and say Lord teach me and show me with the word that's coming forth right now how do I approach this situation by the word amen what do I say and when do I say it right now sometimes listen friends we need we need the Lord's help we need his teaching we all come from all different types of backgrounds we come from all sorts of different ways but we want to know his ways Lord I want to know how that you approach these things Lord how should I approach this with my family notice you've got to teach it to love and respect and to read the Bible Hallelujah you know one thing it was mention I'm just going to mention I thought it was a good point I was at one point in time I was in a meeting and and a brother made a good point that I never had really never had really considered too much before but I thought about it a lot and I know we have listen we have the Bible on our phones Bible on our computer Bible on my iPad I've got the Bible around I'm thankful I've got on all those devices but you know one thing they mentioned they said what about your little kids even if you're reading the Bible but you're reading it on your phone right and they don't see you open the Bible are are they going to know the difference in saying that is having devotional time is good pre are you hearing me are they going to know the difference with that you say well brother Samuel they they ought to know it know you've got to be clear it's got to be intentionally clear is that all right woo Proverbs 22:6 is it hot in here is it just me I know it's hot in here we could probably cook some stuff in here verse six train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it now notice that train up a child in the way no we don't we don't make them but we train them up we show them we direct them train them up in the way they should go and when he is old he will not depart from it right so it's a time of such molding and such Impressions look at Ephesians chap 6 and verse4 the Bible says bring them up the latter part of that verse bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord and then they Amplified just so I don't have to Define every word rear them up tenderly in the training and discipline and the counsel and admonition of the Lord right well Brother Sam how do would I even begin let's just say respect how do I teach them Respect by you respecting all the rest of your brothers and sisters by you respecting Your Wife by you respecting your husband by you respecting one another right is that right now brother brandom teaches I tell you a powerful message you Ain listen to in a while the message respects but you remember the reason those little kids said what they did about Elisha and called him an old ballhead the prophet said is because their parents were talking about Ela now I'm just going to say it like this talking about other ministers other Ministries I don't care if it's wrong is wrong to me don't do it in front of your children don't do it because there might be a portion out of that that could be able to be a help you see it's teaching that respect to rever this is why the prophet could say even when he saw people that would get out of order in service and other things brother B says I'll never speak against it he said because it is the holy spirit even though it may not be in order order are you hearing me now there's what what does it did it say that brother was brother Bram saying he wasn't going to teach it bring the balance on it he no brother R was saying that at all he's saying that while while you see something that's out of order he said don't ever question ansers 59 don't ever disrespect the Holy Spirit are you hearing me oh my so we always we that that teaching of respect it's things that we in our lives how do we respect the message of the hour how do we respect the Bible how do we express love from one to another you see what I'm saying it's got to be something to where that our life should be the absolute picture or Canvas OR betrayal of what the love of God is in this hour you agree with that now notice this remember I read you this quote last week out of the message Elisha the prophet he said if a picture of a ship will impress boys to become Navy men remember them them five boys who became Navy men just just by looking they every morning every night they went to bed looking at that picture and when they woke up they saw that picture of a of a vessel on the sea all five of them went in to become Navy men and the prophet ends that story with he says if a picture of a ship will impress boys to become Navy men Sailors of the sea what ought the picture of the Lord Jesus Christ do always have the right thing before your children that's why listen when and I know when we have to give you know and different things come up listen all of that with smartphones and phones all that stuff was brand new for us I'm talking for me you got young ones right now different ones that raising families and and I mean it started a lot of times before they were born smartphones were already here the phones and the what I'm talking about is all the access and thing that's out there already and listen to me don't just look at somebody else and say well they were this age or they were this old you have to know your children you say is that Bible Jesus said he knows his Sheep by name meaning their characteristic are you hearing me it's established also with with a trust it's something that even with little things you might say brother Samuel do you really have to say this I believe I do as he's bringing it to me I think it ought to be open enough to where that it's not just something that it's off boundaries you should know what's going on on that phone one of the conferences I was at some years ago little ones that were six years old they caught things to where they were looking at things on their laptop and the mother said that's impossible the only time she has this is when she's sitting by me on the couch doing homeschooling you understand I mean you know how it was I mean you can give probably the littlest one in here give them something right man they know how to get around on things don't they they could teach us older ones something they just just sit down a minute I'll teach you how to do it they may not even be able to see Dad D yet but they can there's just something about it innate that they just kind of move right to it is that right that's why there's things at times I have to ask my boys hey hey how do how do I do this how do I clip this or but always having I I believe we ought to be that that involved and invested that's not distrust that's watching over even our home oh my man I I tell you where do you where where does time go it doesn't mean that we stand at the door like Hitler hand over your phone and they March off to the bedroom I I'm I'm saying that not not to be funny it maybe kind of helps you to break up a little bit but to understand friends that these things are not applied in a dictator way it's with a genuine love and trust a trust a trust a trust always have the right thing before your children bring up a child in the way that it should go bring it up and teach it right it certainly won't depart from it now I referred here um in the other the last week I referred and I just wanted to just show this to you here the prophet is referring go ahead and and and move me over here on this please brother brandham refers to this picture and this the Hoffman's head of Christ and you know brother brand would say many times you said I can tell a lot by a home when I go into it and what's around and what's on the walls and things and when you look at it you see how that brother Brandon would talk about in spiritual food and due season of how that the presence of the Lord and how that the coming of the Lord and in the picture he would refer to this picture right here that was taken there on Sunset mountain and he would refer to that which you realize on the in the magazine it was turned the other way because it's Christ looking down to the Earth but that event that took place and yet the prophet here would refer that and said regarding this picture right here he said you know he said I never had seen this picture till I had come into the office of Billy Sunday in his Tabernacle long time ago he said I never seen that picture of the Hoffman's head he said but when I saw it in his office he said that is exactly how he looked when he appeared to me right there in that lot where Parkview Junior High School is is that right and this is the statement that he made he says my house has never been without one of those pictures since it's pretty powerful statement now when you think of even that right there brother Randon would even take it in this time in this hour and he would talk about even even the pictures and he would talk about the picture that we recognize here this is taken in Houston Texas when the challenge was put onto the ministry of of of the Lord Jesus in this hour and how that when we look at this you know when we look at this right here let me see if I can get this off of here when I look at this picture here uh I'm not my my eyes well that's good my eyes do not just stop right there with brother brandham that right there when Brother brandham Talks of this picture he says he had his picture taken with us and what I'm talking about that Pillar of Fire that logos of God the word of God God's thoughts the same Pillar of Fire that led them out of Egypt the same Pillar of Fire that led them all along what did it do it took them out of Egypt and into the the promised land is that right now brother R will talk about this this picture right here and he speaks of how a lady and I'm just just dropping the because I made a couple statements last week and I wanted to be very clear about it brother BR says how this little lady had this picture he said most people put it in a frame and and put the story behind it and he says out of he said here he said what took place he said a little lady was in the hospital and she was dying he said the doctor had given her up with cancer he said and this is her testimony that she said the pillar of fire came out of that picture and hung over her and he said in two days she was dismissed from the hospital that was the testimony that he received he said now look he he says it like this I'm just going to read this and you listen to what he says he said she just looked at it and believed he said now we know to look at it any other way would be idolatry we wouldn't do that it's not the picture it's what it represents so you understand [Laughter] that all right you can switch me back to the notes now so when we look at this in Psalms 127 coming back to our scriptures I I tell you I really believe with all my heart you you can say whatever you want to say about me but I'll tell you those are pictures that I do have in my home because I'm not ashamed of all first of all to be identified with the message of the hour and I'm not just talking about having a picture of it but I have experienced that same Reality by the pillar of fire that brought this message I'm not ashamed of it it's not just something that hangs in my office or something that hangs in my home it's what I am a partaker of the reality of Jesus Christ in this hour Hallelujah the Lord is that all right now you say brother Samuel what what what about there a picture well I'll tell you what I've got enough confidence to believe that if it has already when even brother B said them tapes were being played there in Jamaica he said how that the pillar of fire came out came over and hovered right over that tape player as that tape was being played out I'm going tell you something I want the pillar of fire to be welcome to deal with every one of my children I want the pillar of fire to be ever so welcome when needs and situations come I need him because I need his leadership and guidance in my life Lord teach me thy ways Psalms 127:1 except the Lord build the house they labor in vain that build it except the Lord keep the city The Watchman waketh but in vain notice this in verse 49 of Acts 7 this is what the Lord here as he would speak even regarding the house that was going to be built by by Solomon what house will you build me what a question what house will you build me and it goes on to express you know in that scripture of that my hands have made all these other things my hands have made this my my hand all of the materials that that are used my hands have made these things so it isn't something that we in ourselves want to do of an Earthly origin but what we realize that as we're walking here in this earth that there is a desire that I desire to reflect the Heavenly in the Earthly so in order for that there has to be an opening a channel a connection Lord I I need that Reflection from Heaven to come down and Tabernacle and reflect through this earn vessel is that right now notice this here when you think of it the Bible says in Exodus 258 when God was speaking to Moses and let them make me a sanctuary that I may dwell well among them now you know think about it couldn't God have just come down and put it all together he could have man he could have spoke it it just come together is that right it it could have happened that way but God shows that there's a part in it that every vessel every life were entrusted with certain things like you might have the black onx stones and you might have the goats hair and you might have the you know the the you know the diamonds you might have the you know the topaz and you know God never said hey you give topaz and hey you give black onyx and hey you give God never had to say one thing all he did was unfold the vision and it had an effect on people's lives to surrender the gifts that God had already put in their life ain't that powerful that you look for Lord how can I serve you he's already put it within you all you got to do is surrender when when you surrender and say Lord I just surrender to you even as it goes little by little Lord let everything let your life so overtake me I I want to be more overtaken by am notice that I may dwell among them according to all that I show thee after the pattern of the Tabernacle and the pattern of all of the instruments thereof even so shall you make it so we understand that it's the right materials placed according to the blueprint and how that God think about when God came down and inhabited that Tabernacle think about how when God came down that itself when God came and and dwelt there above that Tabernacle in the wilderness that was God saying you've done exactly what I've told you to dolu now you think there wasn't some times where there might have been thoughts of here and there well this may not you know this this a little too detailed go it's just a little too much God's presence only recognizes himself and when he comes he's recognizing his word oh God let everything Lord within me let it be set in order according to your word Lord is that your desire Lord let it be Lord notice this you know when you think about even when we were looking at you know and the consecrating and the ring around the gift of God that we were talking about with the Queen of Sheba uh the last time and looking at how that you know coming around it we we recognize that it's not just when we talk about WAP ing around the gift of God we're talking about the Holy Ghost we're not just talking about where we come and we sense his presence but we're real rallying around it is where we surrender our lives and give oursel to him and that that same presence comes into our life and changes us and gives direction to our lives that's the real rallying around the gift of God that's how we rally around his presence ah night look at this in the message taking sides with Jesus now we got to think of young people brother BRS I want you to notice what he says he's he's speaking to a group of Brethren here in this message this is a Brother's meeting actually this message right after brother Brams preached restoration of the brid tree and he says we got children and most of us people here married men has children well what about them that's coming on now he's talking to brothers who are believing and walking within the message of all that God has shown at that time but he's directing their focus we've all got children that's coming on what about them now watch how he apply app applies this here he says like I used to kick up down here and throwing about them throwing and casting Nets on the river and pulling out them perch and the drinks and drunkards and things and I've seen them piled up high as this ceiling here big fine perch laying there and the stink would be all around the river I went down as the game War to make them stop it I got a letter it said I got a letter that said leave them alone what are you going to do it belongs to Kentucky so you getting the gist of it that people were going beyond their limits they just were fishing and fishing and going Beyond and brother Bram was a great game more and went down to make him stop that you know throwing stuff in the river and everything else but he got a letter from the state and said stand down don't do nothing now Kentucky Warden can't come over here because he's out of his territory Indiana Warden has nothing to say into it because the water belongs to Kentucky there you are nothing can be done now watch as he says this he's applying this I've got a boy coming on that would like to fish why they put his paper in the P paper if he caught a chub 20 years from now let that go on like that those Nets and traps and everything else what he's saying is is if he catches something that's common right now to catch he would he would picture would be in a paper because it's rare right see it been the over fishing so now he's bringing this and applying it it's practically getting that right now what's the matter you've got to think of these that's coming on now he brings it back to as our children our families we've got to think of the other that's coming on behind us now let me just pause here for a moment you might be sitting here and say well I no longer have children here these are messages on family apply to the whole entire assembly it applies we we have a responsibility as an entire assembly right you as fathers have responsibilities to ensure that your home and your household is pointed and moving in in the right direction I have a responsibility for this household to make sure it's pointed in the right direction yeah it's a big responsibility pray for me I pray for you I trust you do we've got to think of the others that's coming on behind us these young people and so forth and a place for our children our daughters we don't want them out in the world in these things like that we want them girls raised up like their mothers we've got to make arrangements for that and if there is no tomorrow we don't know that if there is no tomorrow we haven't done nothing but been at the Master's business and been found at our post of Duty when he does come we have our responsibility so now with the word that's been entrusted to us it's our responsibility making arrangements for our children coming on making arrangements for our children's children brother Samuel I I believe the Rapture is going to come any day I do too but remember plant potatoes that's right you may not Harvest them but plant them this is this is responsibility arrangements for things that's coming on of preparations making those arrangements in the life not only as brother B would deal with that that that of of what is before us with a place and a house of worship but in every everything that we're doing making an arrangement now notice this here in numbers 152 I've got one more one more area I want to deal with here in numbers 152 the Bible says the children of Israel shall pitch their tents every man by his own camp and every man by his own standard throughout their host but the Levites shall pitch round about the Tabernacle of the testimony that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the children of Israel and the the Levites shall keep the charge of the Tabernacle of Moos of of of testimony brother Brian go to those slides one more time switch over to that that area right there just reach over there and hit that for me I just want to show this the the picture here of that and you're you're familiar with this and what I I want you to think about when you're looking at this picture I wonder many of us how many seen this picture before very very familiar with this there's many other pictures out there but the visual part of it when it speaks of how that their t were to be pitched around the Tabernacle in the wilderness and what's very important with it it's not just that they would be around where the Tabernacle of the Wilderness or the Tabernacle the testimony because what this speaks of is it speaks of God's Dwelling Place in the heart of man it speaks of Jesus Christ that Tabernacle because you and I are the Tabernacle of the Living God we're also stoned in Lively stones in that in that Temple is that right now to think that every everyone underneath under their family they were to they were to pitch their tent now I want you to think of it just like this this is a simple picture but you'll realize when you look down on this Tabernacle here that how that each one of them and each one of them tribes of how it was so placed around the Tabernacle so what was at the center they were looking and beholding the Tabernacle of the Lord that's what was before him now it wasn't enough for them just to say you know what I'm going to bring my tent and I'll put it wherever I want to put it nope you have to be positionally placed that's right is that right has to abide by that standard right is that right has to abide there and the other thing of it is is that when they pitched they did not it was not just an option of you just put your door and face anywhere you want to face you know I mean just no everything was orderly their door to their tent faced the glory of God so no matter where you came from Dad facing the glory of God Mom facing the glory of God in the glory of God this home's facing the glory of God it's facing it's keeping him in view if he becomes just a peripheral don't make that decision bring it back to him and let him be the focus for everything in your life he's to be the center of our conversations the center of all of our doings is that right the center and de see what a blessing that is as we read in our text the opening of that what a blessing that is when he is the center now I want you to think how brother Bram when he brings us here in what house will you build me and I I'm coming down here I'm trying to to bring it down here to a place but when brother Bram preached is that message what house will you build me and I mentioned to you last week if you hadn't listened to that message please listen to it it's 28 minutes long but it's it's a it's a powerful message it has such an Direction cuz when the title is given what house will you build me it's speaking individually what house will you build me individually it's speaking as a church what house will you build me it's speaking of the entirety what house will you build me I know whatever it is and I think we can join together on this whatever it is in my life I want him to be able to dwell I want him to be able to say I feel at home with Samuel I feel at home with his decisions I feel at home because I want to be influenced by him don't you now don't get quiet on me friends well I've made a wrong decision don't don't don't don't let the enemy beat you up you've got an opportunity right here right now don't miss the things that God has given and speaking to our Hearts right now is that right now notice this brother Brandon's whole burden when he even preaches this he's letting him know because a church has just been started right there brother Perry green has just moved up there from Texas it's been a burden brother Bram said the main thing that's burdened my heart is there was no place here in Arizona for the people to come and worship now watch as he says this he says if God has spoke to brother and sister green to come here and has opened a place where our children instead of on Sunday morning riding their bicycles on the streets and running around they have a place to come to worship instead of us sitting around and listening to something we've heard on the radio which is all right but we as this group of people we have a message for this day we believe that God has given us a message and he talking about brother Perry green left everything that was dear to him to come to the desert just to support what God is giv giving to us now he said I believe watch this it's not only should be in our hearts it should be our duty to back him up amen how many say Amen to that so it's not just say in my heart but it's Duty what what's in my heart to come out everything that we can to attend the services to come here to worship and to make this a place where God can reveal to us the things that he has for us to reveal now I certainly believe in a nice building I thank God that he's given us a nice building thank the Lord today for the oven we're in but I thank God for for for a nice place to worship but do you realize we could have all of this right here and still not have him what makes this a nice place to come and worship by consecrated hearts amen is that right a consecrated life individually daily in our walk with God our desire to please God and remember don't don't as I said comparison we don't want to compare ourselves not only do I not want to compare myself with the world God never called you and I to compare ourselves with one another that's right we're to look and let our lives be evaluated by him by the word alone Lord what do you say about my life right now notice this he says where God can reveal to us the things that he has to reveal to us and as his word said the message brother brother green said the message doesn't come to me through the giving of the inspiration as it as it does to maybe to some of us but he said I am here to back up what God has given let me just tell you that's what I'm here to do anybody else with me I'm here to back up what God has given Oh Brother Sam I got to prove it why waste your time God's already done [Applause] it God's already proved it why don't you just give yourself to him and let him prove it in [Applause] [Music] you that he's the same yesterday today and forever I'm here to back up what God has given what a statement and I believe if we will all cooperate together we'll put our hearts to it amen Brianna go down to the last quote in that message please where it starts out I begin brother Bram now notice he's he's he's been watching the people that's gathered out there remember he told people don't come out here where I'm at at Arizona he told him that but now he's seen people that followed him I mean listen friends think about if you or I were there think about the ministry and what you've seen will you tell me you wouldn't be tempted to go either it's true it's true look at this he sees them all as they just he says I see things we all we we need a little bit of picking up in our life as he said the previous paragraph but he says I begin to I begin to feel us all reclining and getting away from the spirit it's become too natural a thing to us we must Worship in the spirit not only our message should be the flame of the hour it should be the flame in our hearts not just the flame of the hour in our hearts it's got to be in our hearts or we can't rightly present it to the people the spirit has to pack the message itself now I just thought kind of like a little bonus here because I know how brother Bram talked about this with when he was very burdened about the those Gathering out there in Arizona in question answers 1964 he said I was called in on something like this the other day he's talking about it I don't know if I put that in there or not pardon me sometimes I shorten these things up yeah brother br's talking about how how ministers were complaining to him and saying brother brandom you know you people that come out here to follow they don't even go to church now brother BR says look you need to go to church he said but you don't accept what they are teaching you their Dogma spit that out right he's talking about being about about being an example now notice what he says regarding this he says Put them kids in Sunday school somewhere and you go to church don't set at home go fishing and hunting and things like that on Sunday you say well I'm not a legalist well you better be in that manner for a while woo Glory well you better be in that manner for a while dishonoring the resurrection of Christ you go to church somewhere another one question ansers number two I believe that I believe we should honor that Resurrection as a memorial let me just finish this trying to finish this part out here every time when the camp in numbers 2 and verse 17 the Bible says that the Tabernacle the congregation Shall Set forward with the camp of the Levites in the midst of the camp as they encamp so shall they set forward every man in his place by their standards so the only direction that we're to have is forward I'm not going backward I'm going forward it's where when God would tell them to set up the camp listen they would have to pack that up everyone had a charge to pack it up and move it to a certain to wherever the pillar of fire LED them and said let's stop right here then the Levites would go everyone that had a specific charge and responsibility would begin to unpack unfold and begin to set up that Tabernacle and then every one of them that had been marching in line they once again just like we showed on that picture they would set up around the Tabernacle according to where they belonged and in their standard and beholding the glory of God think about how crucial it would be
