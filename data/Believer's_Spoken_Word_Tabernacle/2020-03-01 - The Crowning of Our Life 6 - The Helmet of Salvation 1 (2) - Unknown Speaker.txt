with us this morning may the Lord bless you may God bless each and every one of you I heard where they had where the bill had a birthday now you know brother bill was born on February 29 so every four years you have a leap year so if you do the math and you know would divide it out he's somewhere you know around in there maybe I don't know maybe he's close to 20 don't look a day over 17 we certainly love you brother bill appreciate you we want to have a special prayer here this morning brother Richard had given this to me and they it wasn't in in the prayer request basket back there I guess at the time but we want to have prayer for his son Joshua and Jamie that's the father and mother of little Ileana and and makai their son the Richard was riding on here lead they had got together with them at Rachel's house yesterday evening they were there in body but not in spirit they're hurting very bad which the only thing that probably I know some of you brother bill sister Mary there might be some others that maybe have had a loss too into this same connection but we all have experienced loss some of us in different degrees and we were very much aware of the waves that come at first those waves are so they're so there's so much and I myself and my heart I can't imagine what it would be of that of a child because with my dad you know my dad was my buddy but yet there were times believe it or not even though we live next door to one another I didn't see my dad until I got into the office here sometimes on a Thursday night and so you know it was you already had your own family and you're still going so it wasn't like you're there every day or someone you're caring for but I think of that and I'm sure you have too and we just want to keep them in prayer and really just just take it on our hearts because as we mentioned there'll be I did mention this obviously at the funeral service but I thought about this very much and for those that's had loved ones passed away there's always going to be a first there'll be a first birthday the first Thanksgiving a first Christmas there'll be a lot of firsts there'll be a first family reunion everything a lot of firsts that are without them and so we just we really need to keep them in prayer because we're Joshua and Jamie are at they do not have that hope that you and I have and so that they they need the help of the Lord and I would say it like this that God would minister to them a comfort and a protection to keep the enemy at bay I believe we've gotten the word of the Lord to keep the enemy at bay that the Lord Jesus himself would go right there and to deal with their hearts let him know he is the comforter let him know that he cares this just bow our heads Heavenly Father our hearts Lord as an assembly this Lord the need and the prayers Lord it's been before us continually Lord not just in prayer meeting Thursday nights and Sundays but God upon the hearts of your children Lord in this moment and throughout this time even from the time they're in may as a people Lord it became our child it became Lord Jesus as many times we'd pray our little darling Lord and dear God the older Lord is we're not the father and the mother but we carried this burden in prayer standing with brother Richard and sister Maria standing with the family Lord and Lord they're in need right now Lord there's no way in my heart that I could Lord say that that I understand to that level our Lord as far as sympathy but we can have empathy Lord some Lord that God have experienced it Lord are able to move Lord into that realm of of intercessory prayer Lord God Lord in a greater measure than then Lord many of us but I believe it on my heart that Lord is your children we're praying as a body Lord and God whatever vessel that you would use whatever prayer we believe that God that it's the prayers all together Lord that are offered up as we read in the Book of Revelations Lord there was not one prayer distinct from another but every one of the prayers that had been prayed Lord was offered up together Lord and father were just Lord coming to you Lord as priests that have been the Lord redeemed by the blood of the Lamb Lord and we offer Lord God unto you this morning and asked that you administer Lord in a special way to Joshua and to Jamie God were praying Lord that God there would be a shield of protection Lord that father that you would Lord protect them during this time of grieving Lord a time when something Lord so great as this Lord as your prophet would speak to us Lord in the message from that time to know that things like this GOG it consoled drive people Lord Lord to do certain things but we Lord are claiming O God a promise Lord and we ask God for your divine protection Lord over their lives and over their hearts Lord I pray God that Lord that through that under that protection that you would deal with their hearts Lord you know how to reach their hearts Lord that you would reveal yourself Lord that you are the one Lord Oh God who can give them a peace Lord from the heavy burden Lord you're the one Lord that can comfort them for you are the comforter Lord we just ask this morning or gob that your presence Lord that you go there Lord God and arrest their hearts Lord God dear Lord God and Lord it strengthen their spirits Lord in their minds or God and may it be the Lord God turned to you you know how to get the attention Lord of each and every one of your children Lord we pray as well Lord from Makai Oh God that your protection upon his life Oh God and I pray Heavenly Father that Lord you would deal with his heart as well Lord Lord we're looking to you Lord in a special way Lord and we believe these things Lord we ask it now Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen praise the Lord can you say praise the Lord maybe for sake of time this morning let's just go to one verse of scripture in Ephesians 6 we're speaking of the picking on the whole armour of God which is the full Word of God which is the full life of God amen which is to be born again is to have the Holy Spirit where Christ is seated in power in our life and so notice in verse 17 is where we want to go this morning and take the helmet of salvation and those and the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God I want you to notice how these are wrote in the scriptures you will see that all of this armament it comes in the complete package of the Holy Ghost but yet God would point out to us as in the manner that we are to take it use it let us know what it's about and notice he would say we already have the helmet of salvation but it would say take the helmet of salvation this is a great need for our lives take the helmet of salvation god bless you as you're being seated I want to just jump right in here to this scripture this morning and looking at this part of our armor we truly the-the-the-the desire that we would have in our hearts is that the lord as david would say in the scriptures that the Lord teaches my hands to war in another place David would say he teaches my fingers to fight we certainly need the leadership of the Lord and we need his direction and instruction in our life and I look at this thought on the helmet of salvation and we know that the helmet itself is that which would cover over it covers over the head it covers over the mind and when we look at this I want to just take this this direction here this morning as the Lord has as just-so pressed on my heart and to recognize in Isaiah 59 15 where it speaks of how that our Lord Jesus himself when God came down and dwelt in a body of flesh he himself hell had with on him this same armour verse 15 it says yay truth faileth and he that departed from evil maketh himself a prey and the Lord saw it and it displeased him that there was no judgment and when we look at this within the scripture this this scripture you can bring this color over to revelations 5 and and so forth we're seeing truth faileth and when when truth when when as it says truth is faileth and it displeased him that there was no judgment because the scripture said that at a time has come that judgment must begin in the house of God is to be able to lift what is upon the life of of the people and put it back on the one the accuser from the beginning there's got to be one to do that and the law could not do it man could not do it but at God becoming flesh verse 16 and he saw look at this and he saw that there was no man and wondered that there was no intercessor therefore his arm brought salvation unto him and his righteousness it sustained him now would add this in verse 17 for he put on righteousness as a breastplate and an helmet of salvation upon his head he's talking about the Messiah the Lord Jesus Christ and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing and was clad with zeal as a cloak verse 18 according to their deeds accordingly he will repay fury to his adversaries recompense to his enemies to the islands he will repay recompense so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West and his glory from the rising of the Sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a stand against him and the Redeemer shall come to Zion and unto them that turned from transgression in Jacob saith the Lord as for me this is my covenant with them saith the Lord my spirit that is upon thee and my words which I have put in thy mouth shall not depart out of thy mouth nor out of the mouth of thy seed nor out of the mouth of thy seed seed saith the Lord from henceforth and forever now what here what we've just read a portion here in this of the scripture it has dealt with God already seen the need remember before the foundation of the world and Isaiah remember Isaiah being caught up and seeing it on Isaiah 53 he speaks under inspiration and everything that is spoken is that is rendered in a past tense he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities because you see it was already settled from the mind of God what we are witnessing is the unfolding of God's mind of his heart of his word even in this time in this hour and when we look at this in the scripture here you find just in these allotments of Scripture there is a purpose and if I can say it like this when he came he comes to finish what he's already finished I said he comes to finish what he's already finished his finishing is bringing to pass what has already finished his salvation is solid it doesn't stop with the Gentile bride for out of zion shall de delivery come it reaches back over to the Jews in the revealing of his power which is the opening of the fountain in the house of David and it sets forth the Millennium where death is rendered conquered manifestly put underfoot and issues in a new heaven and a new earth a complete restoration it continues to unfold these scriptures I read is a continual unfolding he came here with righteousness as a breastplate and a helmet of salvation the message of Malachi for the prophet of God that was given in this hour is the message of the new birth for the elect for the Jews and for the earth it's the announcing birth pains are at hand so to think of it let's look here as he came with the helmet of salvation let's look at the the approach and how his life was in Luke 4 verse 18 he said the Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord this was already wrote in Isaiah 61 remember Jesus the fulfillment of God's Word is God fulfilling through the lives through the life of the Lord Jesus through the lives of his of his people he fulfills his word and that's the greatest thing that we can ask for is God to fulfill his word and to think of it these were not just random scriptures that were being pulled out but when that scroll was delivered to him the Bible said he found where it was written he knew the scripture in Isaiah but we're here what it was the inspiration of the hour that was sealed in that part of the scripture that inspiration when that word was opened that inspiration came and anointed him whom the word was speaking of and so he could only speak what the word spoke matthew 1:21 and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name Jesus for he shall save he people from their sins not in their sins from their sins very important points he doesn't say the end he saves from he saves his says salvation of the Lord it is to take from the condition where a person is that saving is to take from where a person is and to transport them how does he do that he loosens us from the tie of that all nature through and by the birth of the Holy Ghost in our life Luke 2:14 and he said unto them how is it that you sought me now here he is young boy 12 years old father didn't even do well in him at the time no earthly wisdom of his own but notice what's fake what's fake out of him is the representation and the identity of who he was whis you not that I must be about my father's business I want you to catch these words I must be about my father's business John 5:17 jesus answered them and said my father worketh hitherto and I work he would go on to say in verse 19 verily verily I say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do for what things soever he doeth these also doeth the son likewise remember Jesus alive among the Pharisees these guys could quote the law they could quote the Psalms they could quote the prophets but Jesus his life was a mystery to them you know why they knew all of that but they did not know the god of Moses and even with those who were waiting there were many who were waiting that they were in a condition that would seem hopeless but it was not a condition that was hopeless because he was coming to bring deliverance as a matter of fact the purpose and the focus of the ministry was to bind up the brokenhearted was to set at liberty them that are bound wants to release captives that had been hold and this was the whole burden there that was poured out in the inspiration notice he says in John 9 for I must work the works of him that sent me while it's day the night cometh when no man can work you catch that I must work the works of him as long as I'm in the world I am the light of the world let me just say it like this nothing could deter him from the purpose even his own self are you with me even his own will could not deter him from the will of God he was crawled in a body of flesh you know the body of flesh was garments of vengeance the enemy looked at it and the scripture tells us there were no beauty that they should desire the enemy looked Satanist looked em said just like Abel you know I got Abel just like Ezekiel I got them what he didn't know this one is clothed with garments of vengeance but it is not how the world looks at vengeance he was coming with vengeance to take care of that sinful nature that had come about because of the fall he came and he donned himself with the body he made in the likeness of sinful flesh what was that garments of vengeance he came with business on his mind I can't do nothing now I got business on my mind hallelujah he was so subjected to feel all that we feel and deal with and he overcame his will by surrendering and subjecting himself to death in humility not begrudgingly verse 37 of John 18 you see this is what this this what I'm reading is the effect of the helmet of salvation the direction the leadership John 18:37 Pilate said unto Him are thou a king then jesus answered thou sayest that I'm a king to this end was I born and for this cause came I into the world that I should bear witness unto the truth and every one that is of the truth heareth my voice even standing in the midst of judgment Hall all the way through it wasn't all of a sudden where the purpose just kicked in his life it was it was a housed it was moved with the purpose when you looked at the life of the Lord Jesus it was a life as we just took a few selective scriptures here to show you what he was occupied with was not people's opinions of him people's thoughts of him although they wanted to give their opinions they said all sorts of things about him he was despised and rejected but he did not let himself get caught up in that did he feel that he felt that pressure it was a temptation to try to somehow prove who he was but he realized it was not within him that would have been pride because pride would have led him to try to assert himself but instead God had come down in such a measure that God was able to experience a battle that you and I face on a day-to-day basis where we have to submit ourselves getting away from our pride and in humility submitting ourselves to the word oh he went to Calvary with the helmet of salvation on he had a perfect faith in the perfect God of what the word had said about him he took the promises you see Jesus was not Jesus was not let me just put it to you like this Jesus just did not have him and I don't mean this to be a funny but Jesus did not have if I can bring it down to where we're at Jesus reading of the scripture was not just taken a slip off the table of our daily bread Jesus in the word was not just waiting on there to be a scripture text to him in the morning and he read well I did in my daily Duty that is not how Jesus lived his life he laid himself in the word and when it came time for the spirit to quicken the where he was directed to that word and that word it was there made manifest in his life what was it it was the helmet of salvation these promises were quickened to him when he would walk to Calvary think he would reach back look at the quickening power of God the quickening power of God it overrides the even the the the man or the vessel because here he goes and he stands and he says destroy this temple and I will raise it up again in three days Harry comes going to Calvary he reaches back and takes where David has said in Psalm 16 I have set the Lord always before me because he is at my right hand I shall not be moved therefore my heart is glad and my glory and my glory rejoices my flesh shall rest in hope now let me read it to you how Peter picked it up there and the inspiration that he that is that it would come there on the day of Pentecost and Peter would would would would pick up that scripture I just read and I think it's very important here he said for David in verse 25 of Acts - for David speakers concerning him I foresaw the Lord always before my face David when you were sick yeah I saw him always before my face David when you were in the midst of the trial yep always before I've been made no detours and try to find out where I left it he was always before me the only way baby can you testify well sure the only way that I made it for every test and every trial is when I kept my eyes on him I've put him before I put him over I foresaw the Lord David how were you able to walk and taste a life I foresaw the Lord how are you able to walk David in the face of lions in the face of the enemy how is it that you are able to muster strength to run from soul get out of this situation get out of that situation how is it that you are able to be able to prevail amongst a rebellion that came in your family I foresaw the Lord always before me you want to win the bike don't you if you want to win the bike don't take your eyes off the prize the enemy's objective is to get our eyes here and there but you remember you take your eyes off the destination you end up in detours may the Lord help us notice I've forced hauled the Lord always before my face for he is on my right hand in other words he is seated in power in my life that I should not be moved therefore this is why my heart did rejoice but David didn't you go through some more things yes but my heart was rejoicing rejoicing for the sickness rejoicing for the tests no how is rejoice see because I know this is not my end this is not my destiny I foresaw the Lord always before my face I'm talking about the helmet of salvation and my tongue was glad hallelujah how many say lord help me help me let my tongue be glad let my confession be positive but saying I don't feel no stop that it ain't about what you feel it's about the Word of God that every man's won't be aligned that includes my own you hear me that includes your thoughts and your feelings your word is alive but I take God's Word I'll take God's Word above what you want to suggest to me on thoughts and feelings I will take his word and with his word if there's anything that comes into my mind that's contrary I will cast out now I'm not going to ask her to leave we follow the scripture casting out Satan has me has gotten used to being cast out he was cast out kicked out of heaven he come down to earth come on friends we're not making deals with 'evil is to cast him out we're not trying to reform Devils were anointed by God to cast out Satan let me tell you even like the word is being preached right now gavels are being cast out devils of doubt and unbelief Devils of torment careful's of anxiety Devils of oppression Devils of sickness Devils of disease are being cast out by the power of the word of the Living God amen we have on us the helmet of salvation the doctor says you're going to die but the word says I cannot die I'm alive in him [Applause] kind of look at that helmet of salvation that's a good antiviral program you put that on brother it's got Norton beating everything else of course you just get some other brand you won't have to worry about that but you understand what I mean you put that all and it actually will be a protection the Word of God will filter and not allow anything to come in there moreover also my fresh my flesh did rest in hope because thou wilt not leave my soul in Hell neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption thou has made known to me the ways of life thou shalt make me full of joy with that countenance first Peter for one for as much then as Christ have suffered for us in the flesh arm yourselves likewise with the same mind that word arm means a military expedition not a parade for he that has suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin but he should no longer live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lust of men but to the will of God let me just say it to you very clearly this morning God's salvation does not end with you just getting a cleaned up life it isn't just let me just back up a moment it isn't just for you to feel the load of sin lifted from your life but it's to get that which brought the sin about to get that in line with God and there is a not one person that can do that on your own but you can submit and that's what it has to come by a fool surrender God just didn't save you salvation is not just for you to come to a church I'm just going to be frank this morning you can come to this church and still be lost and go to hell because if you're trusting on just coming to a church you're lost but there's got to be a trust and an anchor in Jesus Christ and let me just tell you something very personally you might have been a pot addict you might have been a drunkard you might have been a fornicator and adulterer or a monger and thanks be to God that he's lifted you from that life but that still is not enough it's got to go deeper to where he becomes your life to where you arm yourself with this mind we're not here just to try to make better people this cost for is to change lives to where Jesus Christ becomes seated in power in this life and where that same life that lived in the body of flesh and said well I might be I may be I will know I must be about my father's business hey we can offer you a better living out here oh hi okay oh that's gonna take me away from the house of God sorry I must be about my father's business I must watch the works of him well it is day Romans 13:11 you see when we're looking at this is to realize that this helmet is made out of brass help me Jesus it's made out of brass it is notice the helmet of salvation the knowledge of knowing this my healing comes from the Lord my salvation comes from God my experience matches the word not the church's idea the word I'm covered over a protection the helmet of salvation deliverance brother Brent said you take that then you go marching forward in Romans 13:11 and knowing the time that now it is high to awake out of sleep for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed verse 12 the night is far spent the day is at hand let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of light let us walk honestly as in the day not in rioting and drunkenness not in chambering and wantonness not in strife and ending but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ and make not provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof don't give the devil an inch not even a millimeter 1st Thessalonians 5 6 therefore let us not sleep as others do but let us watch and be sober for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that be drunken are drunken in the night but let us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love and for an helmet the hope of salvation I want you to catch this Paul in this writing here does not go to list every part of the armour but think how he ties it back in to that of Isaiah 59 where the Lord Jesus he took upon himself a breastplate as righteousness the helmet of salvation because remember the breastplate is not one piece it's two pieces it breastplate is having love and faith together Oh hallelujah so here you have love and faith together and when love and faith get together then you can have hope but without love and faith there ain't no hope I won't hope are you with me love and faith calling together because what think of where we're at we are children of the day the night is far spent just as much as he our bridegroom adorned these garments on Isaiah would be moved by the Spirit of God to pick this up and catch it happy the a very initiation of redemption and notice in this time of a climax or a finishing of redemption we are admonished to adorn the same garments that he was adorned with you know what it speaks of it is rapture time it is time where the body has growth from the feet through the two eyes it's all the way up the eyes have come now the intelligence has entered into the body like Ezekiel's dry bones they have been brought together by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and put Inquisition and the adornment on our lives is righteousness as a breastplate it is the helmet which is the hope of salvation for God verse 9 for God hath not appointed us to wrath but saying I'm just waiting on this to come I went on there I'll tell you when I'm waiting on I'm waiting on what the word said for he hath not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ I thought we already had salvation but we are looking for the end of our salvation we have received the beginning of it where our souls have been delivered from the hold of darkness upon our life and the date start has arisen in our heart the day has already moved in our life we're only waiting for the ending of our salvation or the redemption of the body that which will match what God has done in our soul hallelujah he's not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ you know what I would do I would say I know where I'm going I am redeemed let the redeemed of the Lord think so no say so I am redeemed you wake up in the morning is this the day listen what do you mean is this the day I don't want to get fired I don't want to lose my pension I don't you're looking at the wrong you're looking at the wrong thing your hope is in the wrong thing your hope is in the things of carnality and if your hope is there you'll find yourself dreading you'll find yourself just barely moving along that's why you've got always foresee the Lord before you and we need help sometimes because we walk in this humanity but arm yourselves with that same mind that you will not live you are live your life according to the lust of the flesh you know in that scripture right there many people say well I don't smoke I don't drink I don't do none of those other things anymore praise be to god i've been delivered but yet they talk negative they gave up the dead as far as swearing what would be set out there but they still swear they talk the devil's language I'm no good I'm weakened faith and that's exactly what the Prophet said he said when you gonna talk and negative and saying my faith is really weak he said you're talking the devil's language how about speaking of pure language we've been given a pure language now come on friends don't freeze up on me now Oh blue semi you just don't know what I'm going through you just don't know no but what the Spirit of God is trying to do is help you not remove you from your trial not remove you from you know what you're going through but it's trying to give you an expectation to get your eyes off of the circumstance and get your eyes back on the deliverer he who will save you oh this is what he did he died for us that whether we wake or sleep we should live together with him either way I'm a winner I said either way we're a winner God has answered and will answer and does answer and continues to answer every prayer Maude let me just say how could get going on that prayer here if it is just a wherefore here's verse 11 where for because of this comfort yourselves together I'm gonna send you you know yeah that's what I need I need the comfort of the Lord that's not what he's talking about he said you have access to the comforter these are words that are ministered for your comfort comfort see comfort she owes I am this is a word for you to take and say this is my consolation come on now the Bible speaks the breast of her consolation what does that do a baby does not stop crying because it's nursing it stops crying because it's next to the heartbeat of the mother Oh hallelujah wherefore comfort yourself together and edify one another even as you also do this is what that word hope put on notice how Paul would write here by inspiration put on the helmet which is the hope of salvation this word hope here it is to anticipate usually with pleasure I think it's safe to say you have a contrast to that nobody is anticipating tomorrow morning in the job with pleasure no doubt we're thankful we got jobs right thankful thankful we had jobs but I would say nobody well maybe not I don't know some people might have because you know how it is sometimes it's up and down there's certain times you're like wow and then there's other times and God just happens to go through that law of pro and Collin but this is one thing that we can anticipate with pleasure it is an expectation of good hope and in the Christian sense joyful and confident expectation of eternal salvation if in this life we only have hope we are among most men miserable now notice this hope itself hope is something that was not meant just to be out here loosely hope is something that perhaps we'll look at it here and another time hope is governed as we would see within that verse of scripture we were reading with the breastplate of love and faith Paul would pick it up and write and say that with these right here we have faith hope and charity Paul would write by inspiration and he would not put hope before faith but he would put faith and then right after faith he would write Hulk and with love because love is the predominating force that produces faith and remember blue Graham said faith is burly faith just as brother Brent would say like this I think it's fitting he said it's like that of where he said it's God it's a chest that's hair on it he said but hope all he said hope is a beautiful timid little thing it's got its place he said because if you take a man that's got such Ralph faith man he said like you'll hear some of them that said they got bored old faith he said what happens they ruined their influence among the people because it's not tempered with hope well we'll say that we'll save that you see this is part of our adornment this is part of our garment so to have hope hope itself is not something of just you know like if I come to you or you come to me and say well you know I'm here I'm hoping man I'm hopefully gonna get my dinner right today I'm hoping this is not what hope is hope is not something or you just turn up say well you know I don't know that's not what hope is hope remember faith is the substance of things hoped for I probably gonna need this now notice this in the scripture there must be the armor of the light divine revelation hallelujah now what's report Paul is writing about this here in the book of Acts but it's where Paul remembers being brought before the the the the Pharisees and the Sadducees the governors and his ten before Felix stands before Agrippa and Paul begins to express in these things you know where he would speak and looking at the congregation of the Sadducees and Pharisees Paul just looking at that and he thought man there is a lot of these guys here let me just split them wide open Paul said I'm a Pharisee I believe in the resurrection of the Dead immediately he had some Pharisees that rose up and said man you Sadducees you guys don't believe she's already where the word is working to divide and conquer come on it's just like you can be gathered together with Baptist Pentecostal Methodists and whatever more and you can say I believe the moment I believe that was saved and me do you have some rise up and say oh no not that at all you've already started dividing a conquer and then you go on and say and I also believe there is sanctifying power in the blood of Jesus Christ dividing and conquer you go on to say I believe in a genuine that ISM of the Holy Ghost dividing and conquering and you go on to bring it down to the place that I believe the same Holy Spirit in that is living now inside of my life inside of his body in the fulfillment of the last day promised it's dividing and conquering no repeater God now notice in I in acts 24 24 here is Paul standing before Felix he said I confess unto thee that after the way which they call heresy so worship I the God of my father's believing all things believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets it wasn't that those guys didn't believe the writing they just didn't believe the writing because when it was fulfilled and came off the page they didn't believe it they rejected it and notice Paul says and have hope toward God which they themselves also allowed that there shall be a resurrection of the dead boast of both of the just and unjust he goes on to say here in acts 29 5 which knew me from the beginning if they would testify that after the most straightest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee and now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers unto which promise our twelve tribes instantly serving God day and night you see what polls identify the real true message of God when the revelation stretched the heart of the believer it doesn't take you out of the Bible it puts you right in the scriptures that's the real true revelation of the message in every age it puts us in the scriptures so if there's something that needs to be an addendum you better get rid of that addendum Hunter which promised our 12 tribes instantly serving God day and night hope to come for which hopes sake King Agrippa I'm accused of the Jews see remember the Jews they sought not the righteousness of God by faith they sought it by works is that right you see that shows there was an absence of the light of divine revelation and with that right there it hindered their hope they were blinded for the very thing that they were hoping for you see this show their hope their hope was putting it way out there it's going to come this way it's going to come that way our expectation is of the Lord but it's I mean how you gonna know when it's fulfilled just as I know that when it's been fulfilled that he put the seal on my soul he will declare himself so I would just say like this an encouragement don't miss your answer I said don't miss your answer we are yoked to the word think of how Paul would write this in acts 28 24 this calls therefore I have called for you to see you and to speak with you because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain but you and I are not bound with a man may chain Paul though his hands were bound but Paul was speaking of a greater hold in his life I'm a prisoner of Jesus Christ hallelujah as they would write in the Old Testament prisoners of the hope of Israel gonna be the job we are not yet - the word under man-made bondage of fear you can do this if you do this if you don't do that I tell you let's go no we're not bound in that way that's not what the word is let me just tell you something this morning right here there's nothing's I don't want you to do something because of what I preach I preach God's Word what need to do is say lord help me to die to the world take the world out of my life not all my I can't have this one if I go there like this brother sand is gonna preach on me brother sender is gonna do this but this ham is gonna do this no ask God for something much greater say Lord take the shame from my soul take the world out of my life lord I need deliverance some 130 verse 5 i wait for the lord my soul of wait and in his word do i hope my soul waited for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning I say more than they that watch for the morning Oh David's making an emphasis here I'm telling you I'm watching more for him and I'm watching more for the morning are you are you watching more for him than the growth of your 401k preach brother Sam are you watching more for him than your next job promotion come on now are you watching more for him than being occupied with things that are you looking for him above everything else then I'll say he'll guide you through everything that is before you let Israel hope in the Lord for with the Lord there is mercy and with him is plenteous Redemption and he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities notice how even wrote the Spirit of God breaking over and Isaiah it would write and seem as though that it would be speaking to Isaiah as his servant but yet to recognize it speaking to the Spirit of Christ that is veiled within Isaiah and he would write under the prophecy of the Spirit and he said it is a light thing that thou should us be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to restore the preserved of Israel I will also give thee for Allah to the Gentiles that pound may us be my salvation unto the earth Paul would write in this in Ephesians 1 verse 17 the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of glory who may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him that the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what is the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us were who believe according to the working of his mighty power he would go on to say in Ephesians 4:4 there is one body and one spirit even as ye are called in one hope of your calling remember we were without hope he came to redeem Israel but the mystery that was hidden in there the mystery in the seventy weeks of Daniel the mystery that was there would be a calling out of a Gentile bride as Joseph was rejected of his brother and Joseph was there in Egypt he was given given given a Gentile bride a man and it was there all glory it was there within that Gentile bride there were children that came forth by the name of the NASA and Ephraim the think of it if you can have things in your life Manasseh means for God the one who has caused me to forget I tell you a real birth can cause you to forget your past a real birth can bring healing in your life if you've got hurt in your life say Lord give me a man ask the Lord give me a Manasseh one that has caused me to forget the hurt the rejection the displacement give me healing Lord give me my Manasseh Lord we didn't have no hope but the blood of Jesus Christ has made us nigh Rahab didn't have a hope but Simone brought or not Ruth didn't have a hope but beau has brought her nah this is why Paul could ride in first Timothy 1:1 Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Savior and Lord Jesus Christ which is our hope Titus 1:1 Paul a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ according to the faith of God's elect and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness in hope of eternal life which God that cannot lie promised before the world began listen while you reading the scriptures because this is what he had me to do because if you can recognize and see that your life down here is not just something that began down here but it was there in the mind of God before the foundation of the world your life and my life Psalms 139 oh how wonderful and marvelous are thy thoughts concerning me O Lord I am fearfully and wonderfully made that means marked out with a distinction there are predestinated boundaries that my name is set in not one of the tribes of Israel I was ordained in Christ before the foundation of the world and God sent aware to call me out of Egypt and bring me into the promised land of his word in hope mbuto expectation of eternal life which God that cannot lie promised before the world begin you know if that does it causes you to rise up and say hey the trouble that's before me God already knew about you the devil can say yeah but do you know this is your own choices truth but he's plenteous in Redemption what are you doing I'm talking about the helmet of salvation Oh [Applause] Jesus hallelujah verse three but hath ndu times look at this but hath in due times manifested his word through preaching which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Savior Paul would write in second Corinthians 3:12 regarding the revelation in his heart the ministration of the spirit of how that his heart the veil had been removed from his heart he would say seeing them that we have such hope we use great plainness of speech that means boldness confidence confidence yes because you can see everything and all that you have need of is in him and he is in you Galatians 5 5 for we through the spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith Paul Peter would write 1st Peter 1 verse 3 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which according to his abundant mercy has begotten us again the word begotten again means born again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time I've got an invitation to a wedding but not as a guest you've got an invitation to a wedding not as a guest we're going to the wedding supper because the Uniting has come I'm not looking to see I'm Missy what table I'm at I'm at table 1 or table 2 or table 3 no no we're we're at the bridal party table we're at the bridal party table glory be to God in the highest hey man he has he has birthed us into a lively hope Paula Peter would write on who barely was for Dane before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these last times for you aren't you glad what he already knew concerning you aren't you glad he manifests his thoughts aren't you glad he declares his thoughts aren't you glad that he makes love to you aren't you glad that he sweeps around with his presence and lets you know I love you I've never lost sight of you those things would want to come between us I've always loved you I sought you out you always were mine he manifests in a service like this for when we're going through things what he's already for ordained that we would stand victorious but he would come down brother Carlos and manifest himself and say keep your head up son greater is He that's in you you're more than a conqueror they they just word from anybody this is the mighty Conqueror talking who by him do believe in God that raised him from the dead and gave him glory that's your faith and hope might be in God hallelujah glory be to God in the highest Paul would go on to write about this let me just kind of move here Paul would write about this the hope that's reserved he would Paul would write of it in the first part of Colossians Paul would bring it down into the place through Colossians that place of how that God in verse 27 of Colossians one to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory Christ in you what is it you have been best to a lively hope we're not going out of this service with a manner of will angle handle prompts tomorrow ain't gonna handle from neither are we going out of here looking for problems we're looking for deliverance no sir I'm not looking for defeat we're looking and expecting victory Bruce and I pray for this and it didn't come to pass God always answers his prayer brother madam said if I prayed for ten thousand tonight and every one of them died I'd be standing on the platform tomorrow night ready to pray for the sick why God word can't tell I have hoped in thy word sure none of us thought it would go this long right nobody thought we'd still be here but you know what that don't change our expectation it's it's me it's sweeter now than it was before through every test and every try brother Santa I believe this message more than I ever did it just keeps unfolding cuz it gave me life it is my life the book is open seals are taken over and evolved of it taken off in my life I'm seeing myself brother in the book you're seeing yourself in the book what's happening the clarity of the Holy Spirit anointing our eyes to see ourselves clearly what is the helmet of salvation we know who we are we know and only I believe and we are persuaded that he that he that he is able to keep that which he committed against their day pardon me for a minutes like a boxer in the corner and our corner ain't throwing in no town [Applause] we're not looking for an excuse how many more seconds when we go out there one thing about it oh lord have mercy one thing about it brother Joey our corner that's got our back he's right there with us he said I'll be with you even in you to the end of the age I'll be right there in your life your flesh contacting you're no match within your flesh to contact the devil but Christ in you is greater than any demon it's greater than any sickness it's greater than any trouble what is Christ in you the hope of glory 1st Thessalonians 1 2 we give thanks to God always for owed for you all making mention of you all in our prayers remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labor of love and patience of Hope notice the three together and patience of Hope in our Lord Jesus Christ in the sight of God and our Father knowing brethren beloved your election of God knowing where it's personal to you that I am I was always a son of God I was always a daughter of God your sisters knowing your election noticed this knowing of our election notice for our gospel came not unto you in word only but was also in power and in the Holy Ghost and in much assurance this gospel didn't come to just run Goliath back out of your life it came to take the last head off it came to bring deliverance to Israel it came to bring deliverance to your life as you know what men are a man we were among you for your sake no in your election it was not you it was God who got a hold of you it was God who drew you you didn't read yourself into this message it was God by His grace that has revealed himself to you it is God by His grace that has brought to you life and you realize this message did not come across your path way back Oh incidence it was not accidental when Jesus delivers a package he knows exactly where it's supposed to go you were living in one address but it was that package that would put you in your rightful position at the right address so that every other thing it is founded in Christ Jesus that is your position and as the son of God and a daughter of God we have access to the throne knowing your election brethren as brother William pray here this morning we're not coming Lord to beg that would that would be dis complimentary to him but we come and say my father our Heavenly Father what a privilege it is to know that by divine revelation give me just a little bit more time okay it's just just a little bit more and you became followers of us and of the Lord having received a word in much affliction with joy of the Holy Ghost so that you were in samples or examples to all that believe in Macedonian and Acacia for from you sound that out the word of the Lord not only a Macedonian acacia but also in every place your faith to God word is spread of it spread abroad so that we need not to speak anything for they themselves show us what manner of entering in we had unto you and how you turn to God from idols to serve the living and true God let me just say this this testimony they had in their life what somebody seen a picture in their wallet he wasn't because somebody come on now preach with me they wanted to call somebody seen a picture on their wall it's because the same God who came down and had his picture taken with us is now living in our fish they were testifying of this it wasn't so well let me bring it to my pastor you know he's a real man of God nothing wrong with that thank you for the compliment I trust that's well how you feel I trust that that's the reality not about feeling but that you realize that it's called he's the one that's feeding you but let me just tell you and drop it down real clear you need to have a testimony not a testimony that's important people to brother Samuel not a testimony that just stops and points people said well you know we just believe this and we believe God sent a prophet the testimony in your life he it ought to be a testimony that says the promise that God has made in his word he has come back and he has fulfilled that promise and that same God is living through my life without us even speaking that ought to be the testimony for from you sounded out so if the life expression in your home or anywhere else has left anybody's mind where you would think man it's kind of foggy man I don't know maybe maybe people looking at my life they wouldn't know where I stand well you know I go to brother Sanders Church that don't mean nothing where do you stand in Christ if your identity is only here in this church you got problems you need to have your identity the whole preaching of the gospel is that you would be identified in Christ Jesus there's some friends I'm not against you I'm here to minister to help you that you would have the real hope in your life where a faith loud that would got it notice verse 12 and to wait for his son from heaven whom he raised from the even Jesus which delivered us from the wrath to come 1st Thessalonians 4 I would not have you ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout that's the message that's the Living bread of life that is his own life with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore comfort one another with these words Tidus would write under inspiration see ya this same what we're seeing is the same inspiration these are not new scriptures to us as Bible readers but there's a there there is that which God is making very clear to us when the Lord Jesus came he had righteousness as a breastplate he had on the helmet of salvation what when that word and the promises they were quickened to him he went about the father's business it was a life that was occupied with a fulfillment of the word not that he could bring it to pass but he said it's not me that doeth the works but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works and so that same life moving within you and I it has moved every age what we just read here Paul did not say of those that are lay down there in that lay do see an age those that are down there that are alive and remain Paul didn't write it that way he said though we are alive and remain we shall not hinder Paul preached it as every believer they preached it that the coming of the Lord was in their day and it could happen at any time and the faint the Spirit of God would give them that urgency but you and I we're not preaching of something looking ahead as far as out there to a promise there is a declaration by the fulfillment of the word that gives us a real hope by real faith that the rapture is not something out there but the rapture is in us now we have been brought into the rapture cycle this is the call we of her behold the bridegroom cometh [Applause] this is the call knowing the time brethren our salvation is nearer than when we first believed and all of these here they were right I want to read these okay I just have to read this in Titus what's this because in the Word of God we find strength for the grace of God Titus 2:11 that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world looking for the Blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the Great God and our Savior Jesus Christ who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a peculiar people zealous of good works Timothy Titus 3:3 for we ourselves also were sometimes foolish disobedient deceived serving divers lusts and pleasures living in malice and envy and hateful and hating one another but after the kindness and love of God our Savior toward man appeared not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to His mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost which He shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior that being justified by His grace we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life when you have received the baptism of the Holy Ghost you have received the earnest the earnest of your salvation receive the earnest the downpayment that says Healing has come to my soul I'm no longer sick aren't you worried about this virus no I got a good anti-virus I got inoculated aren't you worried about germ warfare no I already received the antidote I've already been inoculated by the baptism of the holy ghost it's not a life of up and down in in and out it's a life where we have been inoculated by the power of Almighty God it is not me that's overcoming it is Christ in me that's already overcome and manifesting his overcoming power through my life as I surrender to him he manifests his overcoming power in my life so the test the trial whatever it is that you'll be facing look at the consolation you don't have to look way out there for the answer he's already put the answer in you I can't get to that this morning he's already put the answer in ya when he gave you the Holy Ghost he already gave you the answer to every question to every situation come on now all that you have need of is in you because you are in him and he is in you abide in me and my words abide in you ask what you will and it shall be done I believe that with all my heart I believe there's Hart sitting right here right now Becca just right now just from your heart no matter what it is you could look in your heart and say Lord I accept you right now as my Lord and Savior Lord I accept you that has been touching my heart in my life right now right now in your heart you can say Lord I received the Holy Ghost Lord Lord I receive my healing because it's made that personal and that real to you Alleluia the trial you're going through the test you're going through but you might wonder where is the end of it don't be look to the end of the test say lord help me to get my eyes back on you but better say no how am I gonna get through this you were sometime disobedience you were sometimes we were bound in worldly lust we were bound in these things but then he came loose em away you dumb up the hope of salvation knowing my protection my deliverance cometh from the Lord how's this gonna happen he is my deliverer I will hope in his world I will wait on the Lord I will look to him and his job was standing there not knowing what was going on and around him the inspiration would strike job and job would would stand up at that time and say though the skin worms would destroy this body yet in my flesh I shall see God there was a hope that came into job's life he was in the midst of despair Joe had faith God had already bragged on him come on somebody God had already bragged on him this tests and trials weren't coming his way because Joel was well he was out of the will of God and he was out of this and he was out of that we've been delivered from church age thinking come on somebody it was to recognize notice listen to me Joel got away from his faith but his faith never got away from him come on somebody in the valley he restoreth my soul yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow that diamon a those ain't funeral-home scriptures those are scriptures from my life they ain't scriptures I need for somebody to read over me if I told by the way of the grave that's a testimony to me right now the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want [Applause] hallelujah he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside the still waters sometimes the troubled waters it's hard to see herself but then every once while he brings us by still waters and we can look and say yep that's me son of God who does that the Lord is my shepherd right in the presence of mine enemies he prepares the table here known as my head with oil my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me chase after me all the days of my life the prodigal son couldn't outrun him you see we're talking about the helmet of salvation is to see when God in His salvation there is no weakness there's no cracks in this armor this armor is sure it's been tested so what are you saying I'm saying this right here let me back up and get it what brother David said in Psalms 138 6 though the Lord be high yet he hath respect unto the lowly but the proud he knoweth afar off though I walk in the midst of trouble thou wilt revive me thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of vanya of mine enemies and thy right hand shall save me horror lament David he is testifying before the hand has ever picked him up open Sena you know I wouldn't want to bring reproach on the Lord I would want your testifying of a finished work he comes to finish what he's already finished come on somebody already in Romans 8 already in the presence of God he sees you as a finished product come on man we have predestinated them a also called then they are called he also justified those who justify he's already glorified brother Brenner picks it up in Jehovah Jireh he said see God already sees you as a finished product that's why the Spirit of God moves in your heart and in my heart that it will not allow us to be complacent if you find your life where you're complacent this morning let me just tell you just tell the devil get out of here I ain't gonna be your servant no longer I ain't just sticking around and being a church member you're not keeping me from my rights as a believer there is a longing in my heart I wanna know God personally I want to have that deliverance in my heart personally no sir there's a yearning there's a deep that's calling to the deep inside of my soul there is a longing you're not keeping me from my redemptive rights I am claiming my redemptive rights the Lord verse 8 will perfect that which concerns me the mercy or Lord endureth forever forsake not the works of thine hands if you're here this morning and you don't have this hope that I'm talking about it's available to you but Simon how much money no no it's without money or price you could put up all the money you want to go excavate if you could have all the gold that there is even in the earth you'd never be able to buy it well what was it that bought it for me he who came and put on the garments of vengeance he clad himself with zeal the zeal of the Lord of Hosts hath performed this he came to seek you out if you don't have that hope this morning you can have it it's available to you this morning if you've got a need in your body this morning for healing it belongs to you not out there right there faith is starts there scripture now faith yes hope says right now hope says not tomorrow when hope is governed by faith that's produced by love hope says right now but you don't feel no different not about my feeling I'm standing on what he said and if there what nobody else sitting in the congregation this morning God would have took the man of God and spoke that to me because this was for me that's knowing your election that's knowing what belongs to you you got need of deliverance minutes would be setting sin that's in your life maybe there's a weight that's been holding you down I'm not trying to work you up I want you to stand on word I want you to know that greater is He that's in you than he that's in the world I want you to know that he tramped over every principality there was I want you to know there wasn't a sickness there wasn't a disease that he didn't conquer he himself bore our infirmities I don't care what kind of virus it is if it's Jupiter virus corona virus or whatever it is there is nothing that is greater than him and the Lord who forgiveth all thine iniquities and healeth all thy diseases [Applause] let's pray Heavenly Father right now this morning Lord with the helmet of salvation Lord I've preached this morning and I've preached Lord with the helmet of salvation your children my brothers and sisters that God would be part of this local body local platoon that's part of the great army of God around the world half within us and on that helmet of salvation Lord whatever the need is that has come up upon their heart right now may they just serve Lord may their faith may it just rise and accept it may they deny every bit of feeling if any symptom anything that would arise may they not even be focused on that may they be focused on your word of promise if there's one here this morning without that hope and you just want to make it known to the Lord by an uplift at hand say Lord I want that hope Lord I want that hope god bless your hand he sees you he cares god bless you he cares about you remember you lift your hand you just you hold that in your heart that promise belongs to me Jesus came personally to my heart he came to my puke god bless your hands he came personally to me god bless your hands now you take that promise you you receive that promise god bless your hand son hallelujah god bless you you take that promise father right here this morning as you said in your word that the kingdom of God it cometh without observation nor do where you pass right into a life you're the one Lord our lives our hearts were so hardened my heart was hardened there's not a person in here Lord God that our hearts weren't hardened that's where you had to give us a new heart had to give us a new spirit and then you promised that you would cause your spirit to come and dwell in the middle of our lives father these hands that were lifted up your god there's young boys Lord sitting right here 13 years old raise their hand because they believe that this promise is for them it's made so real to their heart the presence of Jesus Christ that hope of salvation Lord God they want that hope Lord - the Lord be seated in power in their life we're not God there's Lord there's older ones that raise their hands you know each and every one of your children nor Jesus I pray that God as they raised their hand they defied gravity they define Lord every thought that would try to come against him Lord may be thoughts that were trying to tell him everything that would be hindering to him maybe we're trying to tell him why they can't but Lord God there is an overwhelming prevailing power of the inspiration of the Holy Ghost it's the inspiration Lord the year of Jubilee Oh God that Lord Jesus has moved upon their heart Lord God that Lord Jesus would move Lord to believe that the promise is for me though I may have been sitting here for years but this is my promise I want that hope Brannen Lord God they've raised their hand Lord to you Lord is your prophet told us we know it to be the truth the Shepherd the chief Shepherd is always on duty when it comes to Lambs being born Lord God granite right now Mayim their heart Lord there'd be such a birth that is taking place Lord God that would move in their hearts with such determination of the grace of God to look to you
