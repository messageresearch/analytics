Hallelujah God bless you family it's good to be together again amen just want to greet you in the name of of the Lord Jesus Christ and and it's always just an honor to be here feels like a homecoming every time that we can be together and so uh just been uh just uh been looking forward to this time and uh looking forward to what the Lord has in store amen we'll just go right to the word of God so I don't keep you [Music] today 1 Corinthians chapter 12 verses 18 to 25 [Music] amen trust the lord to bless brother Samuel on his trip out west and uh use him in the meetings there it's always an honor and privilege to be able to fill in at home so that he can go Amen brother Josh isn't it your birthday this weekend happy birthday amen God bless you 1 Corinthians 12:8 the Bible says but now hath God set the members every one of them in the body as it hath pleased him and if they were all one member where were the body but now are they many members yet but one body and the eye cannot say unto the hand I have no need of thee nor again the head to the feet I have no need of you nay much more those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary and those members of the body which we think to be less honorable upon these we bestow more abundant honor and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness for our comely Parts have no need but God hath tempered the body together having given more abundant honor to that partch which lacked that there should be no Schism in the body oh yes Lord but that the members should have the same care one for another amen could we also read Ephesians chapter 3 before we pray [Music] Ephesians chapter 3: 8-9 he says uh unto me who am less than the least of All Saints is this Grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles The unsearchable Riches of Christ and to make all men see what is The Fellowship of the mystery and here's where I want to take my text this word Fellowship is often translated as economy it's a word that means it speaks of an interchange it speaks of a of a of sort of a group experience where everybody contributes and everybody receives it's the economy of the mystery so I'd like to preach this morning on God's economy Amen to make all men see what is the fellowship or the economy of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hidden God who created All Things by Jesus Christ amen let's just pray Heavenly Father Lord I I pray Lord as we look into your word this morning Father you just come amongst us Lord and I just I just feel in my heart Lord that you got something very specific Lord you want to accomplish this morning Lord I I feel the push I feel the drive Lord of your purpose today I pray Lord you would just connect the dots today Father we're helpless in our human Lord to cause anything to happen today but Lord we're just fully trusting in your spirit to Quicken The Word of Life father Quicken our ears to understand Lord anoint us we pray that Lord we could just have a Clear Vision I pray Lord if there'd be someone here today Lord battling father with those thoughts of insufficiency Lord insecurity Lord uh uh uh uh inferiority father Lord may you just Minister by Your Word until each one of us Lord would leave this place with a boldness father knowing where we stand stand Lord in your purpose and your predestinated calling for this day Lord knowing that each one has value in your economy Lord we just commit ourselves we commit this service to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you as you're seated today amen good to be with you again last time we were together uh a few months ago I was ministering on uh on it's not robbery and if you if you don't remember that I don't blame you that's been a few months longer than I usually remember what's been preached lately but but uh this is a little bit of a part two to that thought and along in those lines and and uh just to recap that for a moment we find that that uh that there's this great mystery amen that's unfolding right in this present day amen right in this Leo ofan age there is a there is a there's this great drama that God has has instituted and and uh and God we find us changes Mass from ages to ages to uh tell this great story of redemption and acted out and caus us to just to just uh be able to receive the revelation of of what was in his heart and and uh and and and his love for for his Fallen sons and daughters and his desire to restore us back to fellowship it's a it's a great drama and and and and Christ is revealing this drama amen but today he's masked not in a messenger not in a prophet not in the body that he walked the shores of Galilee but today he's wearing the mask amen of individual human beings in this time amen that were predestinated to stand here you were predestinated to sit here in church this morning Amen to receive the revelation of this message it would open your eyes to realize that you're not just witnessing this drama but you're actually playing it out because God the great actor is getting behind the mask of your life of your body and he's and that what you are experiencing in your Christian Life is only is is further unveiling the mystery that was in him before the foundation of the world is that right amen it's a mystery amen but it's a many-membered mystery and it's a and it's unfolding in many lives and many situations and many people amen that God is revealing himself through the Bride of Jesus Christ amen and that's the that's the full revelation of this message is not just God revealing himself in in a prophet or the ministry amen of a Kentucky hillbilly but but but uh he's got some Ohio Hillbillies amen and and he's got some farmers and he's got some Factory workers and he's got some mothers and he's got some engineers and he's got some maybe he's got some lawyers even amen that that that he has called and he has chosen them for this day so that he could amen the things that he thought in his mind before the foundation of the world could become a spoken word reality in this day amen and that is what you were called to be you are called to be the Fulfillment of the mystery of God Amen this mysterious purpose that he had in his mind before the foundation of the world Amen are we on the same page there amen amen and so that makes you as an individual a very very special person and it makes the role that you play in the kingdom of God very very vital and very very important because this mystery we find in the scripture amen is going to be an economy amen it's going to be an economy and and the uh uh you know we live we know naturally how the way that we think of an economy you know we're we're living in one wherever human beings are gathered together there's an economy right there's a there's a sell there's a trade and there's a there's a buy and there's a sell and amen and and there's there's an interchange you know that and you'll find that you know uh you cannot separate yourself from it right you can't you can't just decide well I'm just G to I'm just going to you know forget the whole economy I'm going to go start a homestead somewhere and you know I'm going to grow all my own food and do all those kind of thing no somewhere or later you're going to find something that you lack isn't that right amen sooner or later you're going to have to run down to Walmart and get something for your little Homestead or or you're going to have to pay taxes to somewhere you can't get away from it right amen because that's it it takes everybody to make an economy work you know when you get into your car somebody had to mine the ore and somebody had to refine the iron and somebody had to drill the oil and somebody had to put it together and somebody had to do the paint job and somebody everybody had to contribute something is that right amen and you've got to work and you've got to earn and you've got to be part of this thing so that's the great thing about an economy participation is not an option amen and that goes for naturally speaking but that's spiritual too brother sister particip ipation in the economy of the mystery of God is not an option it's going to take you it's you can't just sit around and be a consumer amen you've got to supply something Amen to the economy of God you're you're raised up for a purpose you don't just come you God didn't just raise you up to sit in church and hear singing and hear preaching and consume teaching and consume Ministry and consume gifts amen but he called you to be part of this assembly Amen to be to live in this time and have the spirit of God within you to make you part amen of the revelation of the mystery of God there are things that he put in you and he and he instilled them there amen and he took little little pieces of his mystery and he hid it in individual lives amen so that when we would come together every joint would Supply and it would create the body of Christ living on the earth fulfilling himself and revealing himself oh my amen participation not an option brother sister brother BR said that you you you say me yeah no you were a son or a daughter of God before there was a moon stars or a molecule amen you were Sons and Daughters of God because you're only a physical manifestation of the attributes that were in God at the beginning amen for there's only one form of eternal life and that was you before amen that was you before amen the only form of eternal life you were in the image of God you were made and he said you were manifested for the glory and the fellowship ship of God hallelujah amen and therefore as sure as your Gene had to be in your father before your natural birth he said your spiritual Gene it had to be in God because you're an expression of the attributes of his thoughts before the foundation of the world Amen I like what brother Bram says right here he says no way around it there's no way around it participation is not an option brother sister amen when God thought you in his mind before the foundation of the world and chose you in himself amen then there was no helping it there was no avoiding it you might have fought with it you might have ran from it amen but there was an appointed time and an appointed place when what was in God's mind would become spoken word and he would Quicken it to pass in your life and make you part of the revelation of who he is you're not a nobody you're not just a consumer you're not called to just be a benchwarmer you're part of the revelation of God hallelujah amen no way around it you've got to be part of the unveiling amen and especially in this day you can't get around it brother sister sooner or later what is in you has got to be manifested because the seventh Angel's message is to reveal the whole mystery the whole mystery amen amen it's the so we're living in that time we're living in the big reveal amen It's the final unmasking every single attribute has got to be revealed manifesting time one way or the other whatever seed is in you is going to prove itself it's going to bear fruit amen oh my but brother sister amen there was a mystery to be revealed in this end time and do you realize that the that the ministry of the seventh angel was to reveal all the mysteries of God Amen but see just the Seven Seals and the third pole and the right water baptism and the revelation of the godhead that wasn't all the mystery that was in God Amen but you know there were many attributes that were in him at the beginning one of them was named Ry Hernandez Hallelujah don't you you believe that brother Ray I believe that I believe that God had an attribute in him before the beginning now right now it does not yet appear what Ray Hernandez will be but it's more clear now than it was at the beginning amen cuz it's been spoken hallelujah amen there was an attribute called Nathan Ericson now Nathan Ericson is not what he ought to be Nathan Ericson's not definitely not what he wants to be amen but neither am I used to be what I used to be but I'm becoming what I was amen because there was a picture in the mind of God and he forsaw me he forsaw you he knew what he wanted to get out of you he knew the purpose for which he would raise you up amen it was a mystery then but it's not a mystery now brother sister and the sooner or later we wake up to what this message is trying to get across amen and I realize that it's not just a revelation of Doctrine it's not just a revelation of what church you should belong to or what prophet you should listen to but it is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to the individual Hallelujah where he become where he reveals himself to you that you have been raised up in this day amen to unveil an attribute of the mystery of God Amen and what we didn't know about God yesterday we know a little more today because it's been spoken and it's being lived out right in front of us in brothers and sisters and even in ourselves what a beautiful message amen hallelujah the mystery revealed now brother Bram said now the lamb he begins to explain that there's a time of intercession right amen and and how the lamb is he's at that throne and he's pleading and pleading the blood you know and and and and he's doing a work of intercession amen for for everyone amen but you see he's still he's still on The Mercy Seat he's still on The Mercy Seat why amen you ever ask yourself I preached many times you know you got to think sometimes what are we still doing here Jesus Christ died for our sins 2,000 years ago he shed his blood for all sin for for all mistake he don't have to come back and die again with by one sacrifice amen he has ripped the veil amen and restored us back amen it's it's it's a it's a perfect sacrifice so why 2,000 years later are there are we still here and time's still going on and world events are circling around us what's it all about brother sister a mystery amen because when Jesus Christ walked the Earth and even when he hung on the cross the mystery wasn't finished then it wasn't finished when he went to the Grave amen but when he fell down on the day of Pentecost and begin to in inhabit amen individual Tabernacles with with aspects or attributes of his glory when he busted that Pillar of Fire up and put it into men and women age after age building back to what the Bride of Jesus Christ amen amen like Eve was a mystery in Adam the bride was a m mystery in him but we're living in the day amen when the mystery amen is finished it's open it's revealed you say what was God thinking about before the foundation of the world look in a mirror hallelujah hallelujah amen so he's doing a work of intercession for all these years why because the mystery never stopped unfolding amen and it hasn't stopped yet brother sister because brother Bram said as long as there were names on that book he said there he knew there were names in there that were put there from the foundation of the world and as long as those names have never been manifested on Earth as yet he had to stay there as an intercessor as long as there was one name that had never been declared Christ had to stay there as an intercessor and take care of that name Hallelujah there's no way around that brother sister if you're on his book you're going to have to be expressed amen you're going to have to come forth that's why he couldn't come 2,000 years ago that's why he didn't come in 1977 cuz there were more names on the bookall amen but here we are amen the bride the the literal spoken word seed bride Hallelujah and he said Christ stays there as an intercessor to take care of that name I'm so glad about that that he takes care of those names brother sister he takes care of you he takes care of me not cuz we deserve it not because we return the favor with a perfect religious life but because of a Eternal thought that was in his mind you can't be separated from him amen if you were in his mind that you're in his mind for eternity all of God's thoughts are Eternal and if you and if you were divorced from him he would not no longer be a perfect God so he's jealous that's why he's jealous over you that's why many things you didn't deserve amen amen like they say uh Grace is when you don't deserve something and but you get it anyway Mercy's when you did deserve judgment but you didn't get it amen there were things we didn't deserve things we did deserve amen but grace and mercy has kept you and watched over you why amen because the mystery of God has got to be told it's got to be revealed amen if we could tap into the spirit behind this message then we would see the Zeal of God to perform this amen we would begin we would understand more clearly what it is that drives us to him amen what it is that what the passion in the heart of God to see himself revealed and manifested in individual lives we would understand more his love for us if we would just listen to his word and realize amen that every name every name's got to be manifested every seed's got to be bear fruit Hallelujah no way around it amen so you can't be a halfway you can't just be halfway in this message halfway out a this is an Allin this is a this is to the end my friend amen it's got to be manifested it's got to be fulfilled Hallelujah there's there's a there's a sovereignty of God behind it taking us to our destination you say oh brother Nathan I made a mistake I got out in the permissive will of God brother Bram said amen that the permissive will of God will always come back to glorify his perfect will amen you think you're strong enough in your humanity and your error and your failure and your weakness to get past the grace of God Amen the grace of God is an omnipotent Force amen and it is driving driving driving down through the pages of History so that the mystery of God could be fulfilled and revealed in this end time Hallelujah he won't lose a one he won't lose one of those names you got to realize amen what this is all about friends amen you you if you're one of his children he's taking care of that name see this message isn't just about joining a church it's not about putting your name on a book somewhere amen you got to get a revelation by this message that your name's on that book amen and by that Revelation you realize amen that you're the spoken word of God uh a word is a thought expressed amen we're taught these things amen but that's the problem is that we talk about it talk about it talk about it but this is a reality my friends we can talk talk talk about well we got the word the word the word amen we have the word amen but don't you realize you're the word amen you're the word you've been expressed there's a purpose behind it amen there's something that was sent for and it won't return void it's got to be manifested brother sister brother Bram says notice the word had to be manifested and when the word had to be manifested he said God always sends a prophet to manifest that promise because the word of the Lord comes to him he talks about Moses was called to the job and nobody else could do it Hallelujah nobody else can do it amen hallelujah I I I I just feel led to Branch off here for a minute see the word has got to be manifested amen let's let's just uh let's just understand that clearly today that God sent a message into this world Amen not just to not just to gather a new following not to just be a new church to join but to manifest something actually to manifest someone Amen to to manifest itself amen and so the message when it's taught right preached right amen when it when it's when it's carried right when it's believed right it manifests itself and that manifestation is the Vindication that it was the word of God Amen and so what we want to know is that we are manifesting the word so we say well you know we got all the word on on uh uh uh we got all word on on on the real baptism of the Holy Ghost and what it looks like and what it feels like and what it should be amen but at the end of the day friends amen do we have an atmosphere in the church where a young person amen can get the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen we say well we can we can take the word we can teach deliverance we can explain it all you know we can we can we can put it in its right priority you know Rejoice not that devils are subject to you but your names are written on the land's book of life but at the end of the day friends can we manifest the word and get the people delivered that are bound amen or else what are we doing here on Sunday morning amen we say well you know I got this quote and that quote on worship and this quote on that quote on what songs you should sing and this quote and that quote on Dancing in the spirit amen but can you Worship in this church amen do they dance in the spirit in this church amen that's the question can we manifest the word can at the end of the day is there a real manifestation that goes with it and because if it's a word of God it'll speak for itself God will God is his own interpreter God will bring his word to pass amen so we look for him to fulfill it amen but if there's no fulfillment then we begin to say well what are we missing here and usually what we're missing is amen the understanding amen that it's not a mystery up here somewhere being revealed but it's a mystery right here amen that it's an individual experience of the Revelation manifestation and fulfillment of the prophetic word of God hallelujah amen and nobody else can do it if God called a person for a job to do brother Bram said no one can take its place he said there's no one can take your place with your peculiarity now we're all peculiar is that right I know some of us more than others but see there's nobody can take your place there's nobody can take your peculiarity hallelujah amen brother Bram says now brother BR you know this is a prophet who can get real honest about his complexes amen and and uh and and his inner feelings and things he gets real honest with us he says how often I've wondered I would like to take oral Robert's place my or how I would like to take Billy Graham's place there would be somebody like that but you know what brother Bram said he said I can't be Billy Graham but neither can Billy Graham be me amen I can't be Oral Roberts but Oral Roberts can't be me and he said you are each one set in God's economy just for its place one will Fast all the time and commune with God another one will cast out Devils cuz this one's fasting but it's the whole body of Christ working together that's the unity amen that's the unity we're looking for amen it's not to make me the same as that one or that one the same as me it can't be that way but let me fulfill my role amen let you fulfill your role and it makes the body of Christ Living acting and doing Hallelujah friends like just like see brother BR references there a woman come to him and said brother brandom you know I I don't know if I if I really have the goods cuz I've been praying and fasting and fasting and praying and fasting I praying I've never cast out one devil and he says well sister that's not it he said you're supposed to do the fasting and praying so that I can cast out the Devils amen amen now there's yeah how many how many people sitting uh dozens of people gathered here together amen we don't need a 100 pastors and Believers spoken word Tabernacle we don't need 100 song leaders we don't need 100 deacons we need a body is that right amen and see when you realize that you got a place in the body of Christ what it should mean to you is amen it should be so special to realize that nobody can take your place amen and that if you're peculiar if you're unique amen if you're one of a kind amen then it's only because God wanted a one of a kind he wanted a one in a million he wanted a one in a billion Amen to take their place in the body of Christ and fulfill their purpose amen so that when you put the body together you got nothing less than Jesus Christ in flesh again walk in the face of the Earth amen Amen brother brand could not be Oral Roberts and he couldn't be Billy Graham but they couldn't be brother brandham hallelujah amen I I understand that as a young Minister amen when there's ones that we look up to you know there's ones that are here like brother Samuel I wish I could preach like brother Samuel I wish that I could teach like brother Samuel and have that that gift of an order and that eloquence that he has and that wonderful you know speaking voice and I love that but you know something friends I really like being Nathan Ericson amen this something I share with our young people you know that that that that for our young people to realize you know because I know what it is to be a young person amen I went through my teenage years and I know what self-loathing is and I know what it is to hate who you are and wish you were somebody else and wish that you were different and have all those complexes and insecurities and inferiorities and all those things I went through that brother sister I didn't always feel this way amen but when the message opened up to me amen it became such a revelation amen tell you know what it's not Christian To Love Yourself Christians don't love themselves right but a real true Christianity amen you can love being yourself you can have such a revelation of purpose in your life God's choosing of you amen God's election of you can be so real until you wouldn't trade places with anybody amen I love being Nathan Ericson I love doing what I was called to do amen why amen cuz I can see the mystery unfolding I can see the election of God can you see it today amen yes sir I'm a part of my savior I'm a part of his word I can see who I am hallelujah hallelujah the whole body of Christ working together you are an authentic amen you are a you are a one-of a kind creation of God's expression and God doesn't do anything halfway God doesn't make halfway preachers he doesn't have make halfway mothers he doesn't make halfway deacons he doesn't have make halfway worshippers he don't have make halfway singers God doesn't do anything halfway amen but whoever he calls amen he perfects and he glorifies and he positions and he uses woo Hallelujah he reveals himself through you amen I know I've already preached this here but I'll call it to your remembrance that brother brandham said he said that God wants to uh he wants to dwell with you with your temperament and we say my temperament you know I live with this guy I I don't know about that he said with your temperament he wants to do the kind of things he would do through you he wants to think the kind of thoughts that he would do through you you know where immediately our human Minds go we go to the humanity we go we go look we look at the flesh we look at the unworthiness that's immediately where our minds goes but brother Bram says I know it sounds awful but it's right but it's right oh brother sister Hallelujah he said you're each one set in God's economy just for its place one fasts and communes another one casts out Devils but it's the whole body of Christ working together brother Braham said your name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and he said the color of hair you have have the color eyes you have the stature that you're in God didn't want you to be tall Brother Ray he chose the stature that you're in he said God seen you before the foundation of the world and he seen you a human being like you are now I know we think we than God spun the wheel and there was a big list of names he spun the wheel and went and you and and you just got lucky and he chose you by a lot no friends God had a picture of you in his mind amen a perfect picture you before the foundation of the world he knew he he designed you he knew what you would look like he knew the things that you would go through he knew what you would face all these things were contained in the forn knowledge of God Amen but the election of God wiped away all your cuckle BT p and the predestination of God has secured your future amen you're contained he thought of you he holds you he numbered you he chose you hallelujah what a beautiful thing amen right down to the color hair you would have if you got and the color eyes that you have and the stature that you're in he saw all of that friends amen he he he he saw you in that for knowledge he said put that one on my book that one's going to stand the test Hallelujah put that name on my book not so you'd be like everybody else or that you would conform to some some other image but that he could perfect himself in you perfect the Revelation in you to a Perfection that another and no other human being could manifest it the way you can manifest it cuz it's just to you as an individual friends if that really sinks down amen you'll stand with security like you've never known in your life amen that he designed you I just I love this quote about he picked your the color your eyes and your hair and all those kind of things you know I grew up hearing brother Ron Spencer preach youth meetings you know in that era where he would go to youth camps and things I've heard brother Ron read preach me this quote probably a couple hundred times but you know it takes a little while took me a little while to believe it a't that right and that's why these things bear repeating sometimes because it takes us a little while to really believe it friends but I would just say Lord don't let me leave this place without a firm grasp amen without a revelation a Rock Amen something Anchored In My Soul Brother Nathan's talking about me that there's a higher power Amen in this universe that fornew me he saw me he designed me he's selected me and he has filled me and spoken his word into me to make me a revelation of the whole thing and my part in the Symphony of God is important Amen brother Bram he remember unveiling God he talks about that that bail maker and how you know he he said uh each Bell has got to ring different from the other you know and you mix them different some have some have more iron some have more steel some have more brass just to get just the right amen just to get the he knows the noise noise he wants to get out of it he knows the tune he knows how to shape it he knows how to put you through the fire Amen to get that sound out of you that he wants that's what all the trials that we go through it's all just shaping all those fiery you know the fiery environments amen and things that we have to pass through amen Fire Can't extinguish fire but what he's doing is amen he's shaping us he's molding us amen cuz he wants to get a sound out of you and it won't sound like the pastor it won't sound like the Deacon but it'll harmonize amen it'll fit the scale amen it'll put you right in the same Symphony he even says he bred this one to that one he bred this one to that one can you think about your grandfather's grandfather's grandfather and the wars that they went through and famines and plagues and all those kind of things and accidents that could have happened to them and those near misses and near-death experiences and they wondered what it was all about but God knew what it was all about he knew maybe in a 100 or 200 years amen that the seed lion would have to come to produce his instrument amen his his his his Masterpiece amen and then he would take that Masterpiece which is you and he knew how to shape it he knew how to knock the rough edges off of it he knew what what temperature of fire that you could take amen just to get the right ring out of you amen I make you part of the Symphony of God till he said Till brother Bram said he got exactly what he wanted now if that could settle in today you say what brother Nathan I'm this I'm that I'm that he got he gets exactly what he wants oh trust him friends he knows amen amen he know exactly what he wanted you say well you know you you so you're in this Symphony of of God now some people are playing that lead violin you know somebody somebody they got the trumpet solo and then there's another guy he sits there for two hours and then he pulls out the triangle and hits it one time but brother sister it's not a symphony it's not a symph symphony if he misses that beat amen and that's what it really that's really what true Christianity is you're not trying to be the best you're not trying to be the lead man you're not trying to be in the spotlight all the time it's just say Lord lead me by your spirit and don't let me mobat amen would just let me be right on Queue and do what I'm supposed to do and fulfill my purpose and be what you called me to be amen then I'm just as much a part of this beautiful Symphony amen as the one who's in the spotlight as the one who gets the attention the one who gets the Applause amen but it means just as much amen if God wanted you to play that triangle then he'll get what he wanted see the problem is we look in the mirror and we don't see what we want amen but see God is getting what he wanted amen again and who is this mesic brother Braham says your eyes your stature whatever you was you were in his thinking at the beginning and the only thing that you are is expression after he thought it he spoke it and here you are I just love that he thought it he spoke it and here you are he you say brother Nathan I don't know about this I don't know about that I got this problem I'm going through that issue I'm into these circumstances oh friends he thought you and he spoke you and here you are amen so just let the word of God do its thing just trust that seed that's on the inside of you amen just keep it in the right atmosphere it'll grow it'll push out it'll bear fruit God will make it beautiful in his time hallelujah it's not it's not it's not just nothing it's not just our words and our Ambitions it's the word of God and it does not return void but it shall accomplish that which he sent it and brother Bram says God is Sovereign in his choosing did you know that he said God is Sovereign who was back there to tell him a better way to make the world who would dare to tell him he was running his business wrong you think than God doesn't isn't in control of this economy amen he knows how to run the business friends and as I've preached many times some of you would have tried to tell them some of us would have tried to tell them well you should it should be this way it should be that you should add a little more you should add a little more of this a little more of that oh no he knows the recipe amen he knows what he's doing he knows how to run his business so why is it that we always put what we think over what God thought amen come on friends and your daily life amen when you rather you listen to a voice of condemnation instead of a word of forgiveness a word of justification but we'd rather take our thought of condemnation amen we'd rather take you know God gives us a thought of purpose he gives us a word of purpose of calling of glory amen and we would rather take a complex we would rather listen to our thought of inferiority oh friends amen we got to stop putting our thoughts amen above what he thought amen but oh just to know amen what this message was sent to identify to you amen you it's an eagle scream to you when you get a revelation of this message you're hearing from Earth the opony and it's telling you don't worry little son don't worry little daughter don't worry little Eagle you came from me and you'll accomplish the purpose you got all you're my son you're my daughter you've got all of my potential Hallelujah you're his thought friends so you're Eternal you're special you're powerful Hallelujah brother Bram says that power that you have in you now it could make a new world that's a reality it could make a new world Amen because we're always thinking of our thoughts of well you know this one's big and I'm little and that brother he's got a great gift and I don't and this and that Amen brother Braham said that God doesn't have little weak spots and big heavy spots that are powerful now not everybody's going to speak a new world into existence amen see that power is in you but that's not what it's given for is that right you know if God gave us everything we ever prayed for you ever just think about that you know it would take us about 2 and a half minutes to rip this planet apart with with enforcing our will amen but see but there's so much power in you that whatever he inspires you to do amen then then With God all things are possible and you can do all things through Christ who strengthens you amen there's nothing that can stand in the way of the purpose God has for you but your purpose won't be my purpose and my purpose won't be your purpose it'll be what he raised you up for amen the reason he spoke you into existence but see there's no little weak spots that's in our thinking it's not in God's there's no big heavy spots that are powerful he said the least little touch of God is omnipotent that means all powerful the god that's in you brother if you got you say brother Nathan I got the littlest Mark of deity in me I got less Holy Ghost than anyone else in the body amen I'm just the skin on the bottom of the little toe well praise the Lord you're right down where the action is you're the closest one to the foot of the devil amen all powers of hell are beneath you if you're in the body of Christ you're not half powerful you're all powerful omnipotence is in you Hallelujah glory be to God Amen Hallelujah he said he's seen something to me he's seen something in you he had a reason to save you oh my think about this he said look at the people that are unsaved today look at the millions he could have took beside you oh if that don't humble you down but he took you no one can take your place you're in God's economy nobody can do it that's his love to you Hallelujah that's God's economy now now God's economy God's ways are are higher than our ways his thoughts are higher than our thoughts so to we have to we have to be retrained by revelation we got to to be reprogrammed to think in terms of God's economy because this mind will never do it this carnal mind is enmity with the plan of God it cannot see purpose it cannot see value it cannot see predestination it can't see those things all it can do is measure by human measurement amen so see you got to you got to learn to think in terms of God's economy can we just slow down teach on that for a minute God's economy now now see we live in a natural economy amen and it everything has a value we think about that concept of value you know it's a a powerful thing to think about how it's value and not just value but relative value relative value in other words this thing will have this price and this thing will have this price this this organ and this piano each have a value they have a price and one is more than the other probably the piano amen it's it's got a higher value than that one and so you know yeah this thing has value but when you compare it to the piano it it's not as valuable right it's relative it's all in comparison is that right amen and and and our society that we're Liv in the the world that we're raised in is obsessed with relative value it's obsessed amen with worth it's obsessed with these things it's baked right into our human nature now if like I said just teaching now if it's all right but you know uh uh uh you're take a you ever take a economics 101 in school and some of you kids are going through high schoool and college and thing you sit through economics 101 they first thing they explain to you is about you know they're talking about currency and value and barter and a barter economy and they say oh way back sometime you know they didn't have money hadn't been invented yet so they would just barter and this guy would say well I got a cow and I'll trade my cow for your 10 chickens you know and I got a camel and I'll trade it for your daughter or whatever and and and so and and the barter economy and then eventually you know they figured out they could come up with this thing called money that would represent and that and then that you know that took the the place of a burter economy and you know this very interest to me it's very interesting you might not care just take it for what it's worth but there's never been in all of history and anthropology and archaeology and all those studies they don't know they don't actually know of any society or civilization that ever existed that didn't have money that didn't have currency that didn't have this concept right at the root of it of value and things need to be bought and things be do you know what that tells me that tells me that this this value idea is not just you know some cerebral thing that that that some some something that you know some arbitrary thing that we just invented one day but the concept of value the thought of value goes way down deep to the roots of the human heart I'll tell you goes way back and I believe it goes all the way back to the Garden of Eden amen when Adam had something of Great Value but it was lost friends and ever since Adam lost the garden amen there's been something a desire at the in every human heart they know that they're Fallen they know they need redeemed they know they're unworthy and they need to be bought back every human being intrinsically knows that they they are unworthy and that they're of and they're undervalued and that they need to be redeemed amen whether it's it's conscious or subconscious or at whatever level to be human amen is to doubt your own value is to know that you're unworthy it's to know that you need Redemption can you see that amen but see and that's why in this in the economy of this world Amen you'll always come up lacking listen young people in this world no matter what you achieve amen no matter no matter what you are no matter how attractive how talented how successful you are in this life you will be compared and I know the pain uh uh I know the pain of uh of being a young person being compared to this one and being compared to and comparing yourself and feeling like you're of no value and feel feeling unworthy that's human nature to be under that and you'll always be compared you know that you can you could just make up your mind one day I'm going to be a great piano player and you just sit down and every day you practice put in 10 hours a day of practice practice for 20 years and and just hit the ceiling of your potential as a piano player and sure enough there'll be some 8-year-old in China on YouTube who can just play circles around you and no mat see you're going to be compared and you're going to come up lacking in this life but God's economy glory to God God's economy doesn't look at relative value at all it does not compare you it does not hold you up it does not it does not it does not measure you against a standard God's economy doesn't look at relative value God's economy looks at Eternal value amen and and eternal value is all one all of One Price amen it's eternal life amen there's only one eternal life it's deity it's God Amen your part of him or you're not but if you are then you're of Eternal value Eternal value amen and and and and eternal value doesn't measure it doesn't compare you don't come up lacking you're identified in him in his life in his nature in his attributes his substance Oh Glory friends Hallelujah you're not uh you're not measured by what other people think about you in this economy Amen in God's economy amen you're measured by your con connection to eternal life amen I I believe I preached this before but it Bears repeating in this economy in this human world we have inflation oh yeah we got currencies and we got markets and things and you got to go down and pay $12 for a dozen eggs and and eggs aren't worth $12 the value doesn't match the price but that's the price that has to be paid because of because you know because of all the crazy stuff that happens in our economy amen but see in God's economy there's no inflation the value is the price I said the value is the price amen and if you're a recipient of the grace of the sacrifice of the blood of God then your price your value your worth is the life of God's own son the blood of God was shed for you that's your value it's not inflated oh he didn't get ripped off God knew the price and he knew the value he would receive back and he considered it worth and the great thing about eternal value is it only if one of us if Just One of Us in this building if Just One of Us in this world was part of his thinking at the beginning then he would have died he would have walked up that hill and carried that cross and hung on that tree for one for one amen cuz it's Eternal value to him without it he's not God without you he's not perfect he is not complete until the story of redemption is fully manifested and revealed and he can reconcile you to himself he would have died for one he would have done it you say for me brother Nathan just for you just for you amen oh my amen you think do you think God shed his blood out of obligation no sir he shed his blood because of Desire because of desire you see Eternal value so what I'm preaching to you is not just some kind of a feel-good Joel hting kind of a you know just a a some kind of a a mega churchy Veggie Tales kind of a water down you know oh you're very special and and you know God loves you so much friends because it's not catch this now it's not because I love you as a human being and in my human love I assign you value because we're fellow Christians and we Fellowship Church to church not that I assign you value no in God's economy you are value you are value and if I stopped loving you and if brother Samuel stopped loving you and if your family stopped loving you and if the world rejects you amen you are still valuable you are still worthy amen why because God counted you worthy amen when he came to hang on that tree and shed his blood for you amen it's his desire it's his will it's his evaluation of you amen then why do we argue with the blood of Christ amen why would we disrespect his grace amen by by arguing and holding up our thoughts of insufficiency and our thoughts of guilt and shame throw it all away brother sister and accept the evaluation that God has offered you accept your Eternal value accept Grace Hallelujah you are value you are value amen no matter how great or small anyone around you is no matter what you see we see Great Men great women we see we see great things and we see big eyes and little use we see all those things don't look at that friends that's all in the human way of thinking but if we could really see God's economy amen when we would never doubt our value you know brother Braham said trying to do God a service he said sometimes great guys get together and you hear him say oh great so and so and great so and so our great you know this great one that great one he said don't ever do that there's no great ones Among Us there's only one great one and that's God we are brothers and sisters he said I don't care if you're pastoring a church that's got five people in it that don't make you little that makes you a brother amen he said God doesn't have little children and big children he just has children they're all the same amen he said and God himself came from the ivory palaces of Glory to become one of us now who's the big one amen not come down here to take the form of a priest but a servant and he washed the very clay that he created the feet of his Apostles and others now who's great friends and see in our way of thinking we think well this this is this message it's all about great brother so and so and great brother so- and so and this great church and that great ministry and that great program and great great great all friends amen but what's really great is just to be part of this thing what's really great is to be a brother or sister Amen in the body of Christ part of this great Eternal mystery that's unfolding there's only one rank in the body of Christ that's footwash flunky and no matter how big you are how small how rich how poor amen how how famous how unknown whatever you are brother sister amen there's one rank in the body and that's footwash flunky amen because brother Braham said this Holy Ghost it'll make a silk suit hug Shear sear sucker trousers amen it'll take a brother or sister from any class from any race from any background whatever tradition you came out of friends Amen in this message we are one amen and we can embrace one another and be one with another in Christian love amen and there will always be nonsense there always be politics there will always be fighting amen but beyond all that friends there's a message hallelujah amen there amen the great assessor has come down amen with an open book of evaluation this ain't no Kelly Blue Book amen but this is this is the L's Book of Life and he opened it to us in this age and showed us our name Hallelujah he said you're a part of me you're my blood red ruby Hallelujah you're the ultimate symbol of value to me for you are my bride your bone of my bone your Flesh of My Flesh Spirit of my spirit Power of my power Hallelujah see that's the way that we got to think now now listen amen now brother brandom himself uses we'll use that phrase he'll say our great brother so and so or one of the great generals Among Us and and things like that and he would use us saying so so don't get the idea that it's not like God doesn't have those kind of men it's not like God doesn't have you know Ministries that are known Ministries that are unknown Ministries that travel Ministries that don't travel amen people with great recognized talents people that people people that aren't as recognized some are in the spotlight some are not amen that's how the body's made up amen shall the head shall the ear say to the foot I have no need of thee amen it's not going to all be the same and the reason these things are put in the word amen is not to just change the order of it but to change our evaluation of it it's not that we're all the same in the body of Christ but we're all valued the same we're all valued the same that's why the Bible said the ones that we think we think they of less honor we bestow more abundant honor and the want parts that look uncomely we consider them oh my that they are more beautiful amen so so you can't hold this revelation of go of in jealousy because if they got any jealousy in you amen then you're right back in the realm of of relative to Value amen Petty jealousies and things because daythan and cor could preach what I'm preaching and they say well Moses he's trying to make himself big something and everybody looks at Moses and everybody everybody talks about his ministry and they never talk about me you know and and oh he Moses thinks he's such a big shot and those Petty jealousies would actually prevent the Revelation meanwhile you got a Joshua he says yeah let Moses be the greatest man he could be let me sit at his feet and that's why Joshua could be a successor and why Joshua could accomplish his purpose friends amen cuz you can't receive this Revelation in jealousy can you see what I'm saying amen so big so don't take this as a amen when you when you when you get a revelation that everybody in the economy of God has valued the same and hasn't of purpose of equal value don't use it to attack your brother don't use it to tear down your sister it shows you got don't have the Revelation yet amen but it makes us hold up our head and stand up strong amen and say I am part part of this thing amen I am called to be part of the revelation of the of the mystery I can accept headship I can accept Ministries amen might go further than me and do more than me but like I said I like to be Nathan Ericson and I like to be what God called me to be and do what he called me to do that's what I like to be and I'm thankful amen just for his calling for his grace and I can see the value I can see the value and I don't depend on what anybody else recognizes or what anybody else thinks isn't that a beautiful place to live imagine free of jealousy free of of what everybody else thinks free of scrutiny free of comparison free of oh my free of judgments and dramas and all those kind of things oh friends this truth will set you free amen this this look friends who could preach adoption like brother Brandon maybe I've already preached this here uh like I said we might repeat some things I just go in the way I feel to go but brother Brandon think about it now if you that if if if God had come down in the 1960s to any of these great charismatic leaders you know all these televangelists and divine healers and all these guys that were raising up God could have went to any of them and said I chose you in this age and you're going to preach the mystery you're going to open up the mystery of adoption to the world you're going to be the one you're going to be one who preaches the manifestation of sons and what would it have been what would have been for any of those guys I won't name names but you know what it would have been it would have been a worldwide media phenomenon it would have been that guy would have been on TV all around the globe emptying out hospitals and walking on water and doing all those things you know there would have been no place for you there' have been no air time for me or for you no friends amen but God sends a prophet to preach the revelation of adoption and he preaches the series on adoption and he says look if you're a farmer if you're a housewife if you're a factory worker if you're whatever you are just be the best best thing that you could be just be you and and he said and your positional placing makes you part of this great adoption amen and you're manifesting the attribute of God that's in you in a way that nobody else can do and you're irreplaceable what a beautiful message friends there's room for you in this message there's room for me amen there's room amen it's not all great ones amen it's not all spotlights but it's just a daily Christian Life knowing that everything that you're going through and everything that you're facing and the story that is unfolding in your individual life is a part of the Great drama amen it's a it's an indispensable Irreplaceable amen uh invaluable part of the economy of God brother br's preaching on that strippling David what that means to our young people that's you know don't let anybody despise your youth amen don't let anybody well you say say well brother Nathan I might not be young in years but I'm young in the kingdom of God I only got saved a year ago or a month ago and don't let anybody despise your youth amen oh my friends amen just live for Christ you got a purpose in the church like the one who sat there 50 years and some people sit in a church 50 years and they never do anything for the Lord and so you say well I just got here but oh friends we'll get to those 11,000 workers in a minute but let me read this beautiful quote from great warrior David brother Bram they he's dealing with this he says well brother brandom I wasn't called to be a preacher he said you might be called to be a housewife but you got your position in Christ by the Holy Ghost you're just as much David as the rest of them was hallelujah amen friends amen I know I know I I I I understand somewhat what it what it is to be a woman that believes this message to be to be a girl or to be a woman or a real lady of God Amen and I I I know you don't get treated right sometimes I know that you you don't get appreciated even by brothers and sisters sometimes you feel undervalued amen many all of you felt undervalued at some point or another just cuz you're a woman amen but just to see this message amen that that if you're called to be that housewife you're just as dripping with the anointed oil amen as every Prophet priest amen everyone in the five-fold ministry to think if we could just get a revelation amen of our position of our calling Amen to think that God if we could just see it right to see that God has raised up women in this time amen that he could fly them in the face amen of the enemy coming in like a flood and make you the banner of his Holiness and example of real Christian character of what a feminine amen attribute of God is supposed to look like the Fifth Gospel the word made flesh Hallelujah nobody can take your place not in God's economy Hallelujah every joint supplies so nobody in this body is without a purpose hey amen so you can't just be a consumer every joint supplies you can't just be like in our natural economy you can't just sit on your couch all day and eat Cheetos got to go to work got to go to work amen you got to supply something you've got to contribute something to this world Amen it's the same in God's economy you can't just be a consumer and praise God you don't have to be amen God didn't call anybody to the bright of Jesus Christ just to warm up you and never do anything for the Lord but he called each one with a unique amen and a and a purpose of Great Value you say well this one's got that H that one received that that's what the parable of the talents is all about one gets 10 one gets five one gets one the way we count we think we think uh we think well if I only get one then what's the point oh well don't bury that thing amen Faithful is he he that's faithful with little God gives much is that right and so the problem is not not with the word it's not with your calling it's with our attitude about it amen say well I wanted to be this and I wanted to be that oh friends I'm just glad I'm in this thing what is the mystery behind this message it's Christ in you amen so the mystery is amen is not what's being revealed to your life what's being revealed through your life that's the real mystery what do do Christ what does Dei look like in you I want to know I want to see it oh friends and we're seeing it more day by day Hallelujah you look at those 11th Hour workers you know and we know the story it was the ones that came last they got the same reward the ones who came right at the end so some guy's been working all day you know how you'd feel you've been working all day long you get a hundred bucks and a guy showed up five minutes before closing he gets a hundred bucks amen and it seems unjust amen that's how that's how it looks to be part of this layout of seeing bride in 2023 the prophet came 60 years ago and we're living in overtime we think amen and and we're looking at this and and just just let this unfold to us now but see the master he says I'll call whoever I want to call and I'll pay him whatever I think they're worth amen he he said he said you look you be content it's many are called but few are chosen those that God has chose he promised a wage he promised a wage you said oh brother Nathan it's a this is a bride age then there should be a bride wage there should be a bride manifestation there should be a movement there should be something going on let me maybe go at it this way you know what I hope I'm not repeating myself again but but but I heard something one day just stuck with me brother where uh it was one of those times in the economy when there the UN employment rate was really high nobody could find a job you know and uh a little different from right now but it was one of those times and and uh and I heard somebody saying Well everybody's saying there's no work there's no work brother bill there's no work out there no work for me he said but when you look around at the world bridges are falling apart little kids are going hungry people are homeless there's Wars there's famines there's sickness there's all this stuff there's plenty of work to be done in this world he said there's just no jobs and so the moral of the story is never confuse a job with work friends now that's so that's so spiritual don't you ever think just because you're not a deacon or because you're not a preacher or because you don't have a a position in the body of Christ or because people don't recognize or people don't acknowledge what you're doing amen we we need some people that don't care about any of that but somebody who cares about the work he said the the the harvest is great but the workers are few what we got is a lot of employees amen we got a lot of people around the kingdom of God not my job not my job not my job but is there somebody who just wants to work is there somebody who cares about the work cares about the cause somebody who says I don't care if I go unrecognized I don't care if I never get my five minutes in the spotlight but let me do something for the kingdom of God God let me make a difference God let me let me let me change it for the better let me leave this message better than it was when I got here let me do something for you Lord let me work oh that's burning away in my heart friends I I want to do a work for the master I want to do a work friends and if we if we believe this message right amen there's a work for you to do and nobody can take your place and nobody can be a substitute for you Hallelujah you say there's no time brother Nathan the Lord might come tomorrow there's no time they had time to work you know there was time to work in brother brandom's day my parents had time to work my grandparents had time to work but you know I mean the look at what's happening in the world and look at Russia and look at all this and I there's no time for me brother Nathan we're out of time brother Bram said he said if I knew the Lord was coming tomorrow but my roof needed fixing he said when the Lord came back I'd be up there hammering on my roof amen and friends that's what I want to be that's what's in my heart I know the Lord could come tomorrow but there's time I believe there's time there's not much time but there's time amen for me to do something for him there's time for me to fulfill my purpose there's time young man there's time young woman amen don't sit around amen and wait oh my oh my there something there's something in my heart today surging in the rain saying God don't let me miss my opportunity amen don't let me waste the prime of my life let me do something for the kingdom of God let me do something not for the recognition not for the relative value but for the Eternal purpose of God cuz one day that's the only thing that'll matter anymore one day all our evaluations and all of our comparisons and all of our relativity will all perish and all that will be left amen is what we did for him oh friends what a beautiful thought though amen that all this toil that we do down here all the things that we do that don't matter you know I I I work for blue origin and I just don't believe the Lord raised me up to helping people go to space I don't believe that's my purpose in life but you know it pays the bills and it feeds my family and we understand those natural things but oh but thank God for a message amen which comes down and reveals to the individual says you're made for more than that you're more than that career you're more than that house you're more than that mortgage you're more than that than that than you're more than any of that relative value you're you're part of me part of my plan part of my purpose Hallelujah want to be like oh oh friends we're living in a time of Exodus and won't it be wonderful amen when we hear that trumpet sound amen I think of those children of Israel those hammers amen those pitchforks those things that They Carried and they labored for some Pharaoh Egyptian worldly system all of those years amen they could throw those things down and March past those pyramids and March past those sphinxes March past all those things that they built for pharaoh and March right out of there Hallelujah say I'm going to something greater than this over there I'm going to work and nobody will take it from me I'll build and nobody else will inherit I'll plant nobody else will eat it oh friends Eternal value Eternal purpose Eternal worth hallelujah hallelujah that cruel Taskmaster now now if the Lord's been dealing with you in this service you got those complexes you lack that self-worth you got that inferiority complex it's eating you up and you're so consumed with the comparison and looking at this one and that one and measuring against and all those things oh my isn't that such a cruel Taskmaster isn't that such a cruel devil that rides on your shoulders he says yeah you're not as good as that one you're not as pretty as her you're not as talented as him you're not as comparison worthlessness unworthiness shame complexes insecurity what a cruel Taskmaster you know what we ought to do this morning we ought to throw a revolution amen we ought to go on strike would you just like to do that would you stand your feet today and how many would truly in your heart say Lord I want to repent of my worldly thinking my human thinking Lord I I want my thinking to be in terms of God's economy Lord I I want to throw down those thoughts of condemnation I want to throw down that Spirit of unworthiness all those complexes all those things Lord I don't want to carry out the door I want to throw my hammers down and walk out of my Egypt would you like to do that that's what the message was sent for that's what God sent me I believe to minister to you today to tell you that you're free from that thing you're free there's a place there there there there's a reality that you can live in where you don't have to be compared you don't have to be measured and come up wanting amen it's Eternal value Eternal worth amen part of him if he's worthy then you're worthy if he's righteous you're righteous if he's valuable oh then you're valuable if the precious blood of Jesus is worth anything then you're worth everything to him let's bow our heads now as they just play something softly now amen just by an uplifted hand Lord change my thinking give me a real revelation of my eternal value hands all over the building my hands raised to him let's pray together Church heavenly father thank you thank you for this word Lord Lord which has been an
