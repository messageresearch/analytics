[37:23] I can see brother Shawn as is correct
[37:26] and I saw brother Alex and just happy to
[37:28] let them down at the men's meeting and
[37:30] and you all made me feel very welcome
[37:34] and so I can tell brother Sam that he'd
[37:39] be proud of you and just a real warm
[37:42] spirit and I appreciate that and I know
[37:45] your pastor will too so if you got your
[37:51] word there opened up your sword we'll
[37:55] just start at let's start at verse 2
[37:59] Grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[38:02] through the knowledge of God and if
[38:04] Jesus our Lord we're at 2nd 2nd Peter 1
[38:08] in verse 3
[38:09] according as his divine power hath given
[38:11] us all good things that pertain unto
[38:14] life and godliness through the knowledge
[38:17] of him that hath called us to glory and
[38:20] virtue and I want you to just catch that
[38:22] because there's there's really important
[38:27] keys in here that'll give us believers a
[38:30] real rest and I want to I just want you
[38:33] to catch him according as his divine
[38:34] power his divine power have given us if
[38:39] I give you something
[38:40] I'm giving you a gift I'm not gonna
[38:42] expect it back I'm giving it it's yours
[38:46] all good things
[38:48] let's see has given us all things that
[38:51] pertain unto life and godliness through
[38:53] the knowledge of him that hath called us
[38:55] to glory and virtue whereby are given
[38:58] given again that we're given unto us
[39:00] exceeding great and precious promises
[39:03] that by these these promises you might
[39:07] be partakers of the divine nature having
[39:09] escaped the corruption that is in the
[39:11] world through lust and beside this
[39:14] giving all diligence add to your faith
[39:16] virtue to virtue knowledge and to
[39:20] knowledge temperance and to temperance
[39:22] patience and to patience godliness and
[39:25] to godliness brotherly kindness to
[39:28] brotherly kindness charity for if these
[39:30] things be in you and abound they make
[39:33] you that you that ye shall neither be
[39:35] barren nor unfruitful and the knowledge
[39:38] of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that
[39:40] lacketh these things as blind and cannot
[39:42] see afar off and hath forgotten that he
[39:45] was purged from his old sins wherefore
[39:47] the rather brethren giving diligence to
[39:49] make your calling and election sure for
[39:52] if ye be if you do these things ye shall
[39:55] never fall the Lord had his blessing to
[40:00] the reading of the word you can have
[40:01] your seats so my heart this morning is
[40:09] just to continue on it'll never be the
[40:14] same with your pastor being out but my
[40:19] heart is that he would find things in
[40:22] order and decently and my heart is that
[40:26] the sheep be fed the Sheep be fed sheep
[40:29] food I'm not interested in and you
[40:32] knowing me more though we want that also
[40:37] as fellowship but in in regards to the
[40:41] Word of God it's it's to connect your
[40:44] heart with the heart of God and not
[40:47] myself so I just appreciate the
[40:49] opportunity and bring greetings from
[40:52] back home
[40:53] also so we've read here in second Peter
[40:56] and you're all probably familiar with
[40:59] the message stature of a perfect man
[41:01] and I'd like to speak with you a little
[41:04] bit out of that this morning and in that
[41:10] message the profit keeps commenting and
[41:12] he in kind of laying the foundation and
[41:15] also towards the end he he's constantly
[41:18] saying the believers desire is to be
[41:21] closer to God the believers desire is to
[41:24] be like Christ and we can all say Amen
[41:27] it's a true believer that is our desires
[41:30] but the question we all have and the
[41:34] reason that we're here this morning is
[41:35] how do we get there what do we need to
[41:38] do what that's what we're striving for
[41:42] but how do we get there what do we do
[41:43] what is the secret to manifesting
[41:45] Christ's in our living and our everyday
[41:48] life because that's what that's what we
[41:50] desire the Prophet also says in the
[41:52] beginning of the statue of a perfect man
[41:54] he says my whole subject this morning is
[41:56] based on faith and that's going to be an
[41:58] important part of this my whole subject
[42:01] this morning is based on faith in
[42:03] another spot he says faith is the key
[42:05] it's the key to unlocking the door to
[42:08] stepping into that stature and he says
[42:12] all Christianity all you are all you
[42:14] ever will be is based upon faith in the
[42:16] word and how true it would be because in
[42:20] these in the opening of 2nd Peter here
[42:22] Peters telling us by these great and
[42:25] precious promises do you I guess I'd ask
[42:29] you the question do you see the Word of
[42:31] God as promises to you are they are they
[42:34] precious to you we they become precious
[42:38] and more and more as time goes on and
[42:40] maybe as we get older in our walk and
[42:42] older and life you realize that you
[42:45] realize the older you get the more you
[42:47] don't know and you would think it would
[42:50] be the opposite you know as a young man
[42:52] you would say well I don't really know
[42:53] anything but most times what we find as
[42:55] young men think they know everything and
[42:57] not no offense to my young brothers you
[43:01] know I've been there and and you know
[43:04] even even
[43:05] now there might be things that I I think
[43:07] I might know a little bit but but I come
[43:10] to know more and more I realized that
[43:12] you know I really don't know a whole lot
[43:13] and and that's actually a key that you
[43:17] know the opposite of this world the
[43:19] Prophet taught us you know I forget his
[43:22] exact words but he said just just don't
[43:23] know a whole lot just don't know a whole
[43:26] lot and so completely opposite to this
[43:28] world but we want to know these precious
[43:31] promises we we must know them because by
[43:35] knowing them and getting closer to God
[43:38] that's going to build our faith faith
[43:40] cometh by hearing and hearing by the
[43:42] word so as you as you hear these
[43:44] precious promises your faith something
[43:47] on the inside will reach out and grab a
[43:50] hold of them you might not feel like
[43:53] you're there yet this morning and you
[43:55] may feel the farthest thing from them
[43:56] and you say brother Brandon I don't I
[43:58] don't feel like these are mine yet just
[44:00] just just stand and wait be steady be
[44:05] steady stand still and so I just want to
[44:11] take it down and I always I always get a
[44:14] little fearful that I'll read too much
[44:16] but I just I just want to kind of give
[44:19] you in laying a foundation for this my
[44:23] mind set and in getting on this I've
[44:25] been preaching this back home when I'm
[44:28] called on to preach there and I just I
[44:31] was asking the Lord I just read you a
[44:33] couple quotes here the Prophet said and
[44:36] I heard a voice and this is out of
[44:38] rejected King and I heard a voice then
[44:40] that spoke to me that was in the room
[44:43] said this is what you preached was the
[44:45] Holy Ghost this is perfect love and
[44:47] nothing can enter here without it now
[44:50] this is when he goes beyond the curtain
[44:52] of time I am more determined says than
[44:55] ever in my life that it takes perfect
[44:57] love to enter there there was no
[44:59] jealousy there was no tiredness there
[45:01] was no death sickness could never in in
[45:04] in their mortality could could never
[45:07] make you old and they could not cry it
[45:10] was just one joy and we're striving to
[45:15] to be Christ here on earth but we're
[45:17] striving for the redemption
[45:19] of our bodies for for that great
[45:22] combination of things that climax in in
[45:25] the rapture and that's our heart's
[45:27] desire and and I guess I see you know
[45:30] these young brothers on the front row
[45:31] you know there there is life ahead of
[45:34] you
[45:34] there is years ahead of you things you
[45:36] want to accomplish but I'll tell you
[45:38] there's nothing in this life that will
[45:41] compare to to what's over there waiting
[45:43] for us
[45:44] there's absolutely method so set your
[45:49] ambitions and work towards those things
[45:51] that's good we would encourage you to do
[45:53] that but don't ever let it cloud your
[45:56] vision so that to the heavenly vision
[45:58] but so the key to getting over there is
[46:01] perfect love nothing will enter here but
[46:04] perfect love and in birth pains he says
[46:07] because now this is the prophecy that
[46:10] was given over brother Branham because
[46:11] thou has chosen the narrow path the
[46:13] harder way thou has walked of your own
[46:16] choosing thou has picked the correct and
[46:18] precise decision and it is my way
[46:20] because of this momentous decision a
[46:23] huge portion of heaven awaits thee and
[46:25] now I you know you would think of that
[46:28] as as as landscape you know this plot of
[46:31] land over here is your portion but
[46:34] that's not what this is referring to I
[46:35] found in studying it's actually your
[46:38] portion of the word your portion of
[46:41] heaven your portion of huge portion of
[46:43] heaven of the word awaits thee what a
[46:46] glorious decision now has made this in
[46:48] itself is that which will give and may
[46:50] come to pass the tremendous victory and
[46:53] love divine and another spot he says
[46:56] it'll bring to pass their tremendous
[46:58] victory and love their mind however it
[47:01] was said this that put yourself there
[47:04] put yourself there if nothing but
[47:07] perfect love divine love will enter them
[47:09] there but then these decisions this will
[47:12] bring a victory and love divine in our
[47:16] decisions and and I believe that that's
[47:18] not just a promise to the Prophet I
[47:20] believe as the bride that he was sent
[47:22] for we can latch on to that this is our
[47:26] tremendous victory in love divine so
[47:29] love divine character is a
[47:31] three amen so I asked the Lord and just
[47:41] trying to approach this this subject on
[47:43] love divine the Lord what's what's the
[47:46] starting place this just seems like such
[47:48] a such an important subject such a such
[47:52] a tremendous thing and I and then in
[47:55] prayer it just came back in and it was
[47:58] the stature of a perfect man because in
[48:00] verse seven after he lists these seven
[48:04] virtues he says and then charity and the
[48:09] Prophet says charity caps it charity
[48:13] caps the perfect man and so what's the
[48:16] foundation is is these virtues these
[48:19] things must be flowing from our life we
[48:21] must have them in them for that divine
[48:23] love for that victory and love divine to
[48:25] come forward the these you cannot have
[48:28] you cannot be lacking in these things so
[48:32] our nature is changed by receiving his
[48:34] nature so how do we get there our
[48:36] natures reciept change by receiving his
[48:39] nature then after we receive his nature
[48:41] we are to give diligence the scripture
[48:43] says to adding to our stature to
[48:45] becoming the perfect man Christ but the
[48:49] but there's something you must
[48:50] understand in our desire to become the
[48:54] perfect man Satan is going to fight you
[48:57] every step of the way that goes without
[49:00] saying I know but it's an important
[49:02] element because you make mistakes and
[49:05] you'll fall short and and you'll have
[49:08] shortcomings and and you'll you'll
[49:10] you'll have those times where you just
[49:13] sit there and put your hands over your
[49:15] face and say God how did I get here what
[49:18] did I what did I just do what did I just
[49:19] say why Lord and the believers gonna
[49:22] examine themselves where did that come
[49:24] from Lord why why did that manifest
[49:27] itself that way this isn't this isn't my
[49:30] heart but but Lord searched me Oh God
[49:33] then we then we we can we can step into
[49:36] that pray or as David prayed and it's
[49:38] not a it doesn't become a song it
[49:41] becomes our prayer search me O God and
[49:44] all my heart I pray
[49:47] you're a 3-part being two parts of that
[49:51] is unsaved so in the odds of say a
[49:58] sporting event we would we would want to
[50:01] play a little one-on-one okay well for
[50:07] whatever reason this is set up this way
[50:09] your your your partner that you're going
[50:12] to be playing against just invited a
[50:15] buddy over and now it's going to be two
[50:17] against one it seems unfair but the
[50:21] thing is is that when you receive the
[50:23] nature of Christ that's everything you
[50:25] need your skill level is going to be so
[50:29] far beyond those two parts you're gonna
[50:33] win the end of the game has already been
[50:36] determined amen and that's going to flow
[50:39] from the inner man not not the part not
[50:42] the part that you see okay it's not the
[50:45] part that you see it's the inner man
[50:47] that you don't see and you might not
[50:49] feel like you're there this morning you
[50:51] might feel so far away from it but I'll
[50:53] tell you if you have a desire to become
[50:56] the perfect man or perfect woman of
[50:58] Jesus Christ
[50:58] that's all that's what you need that's
[51:01] that should tell you that there's
[51:02] something on the inside of the inside so
[51:09] if you in the back there if that picture
[51:12] we can come up if you have that I just
[51:16] want to show you this so I'm sure many
[51:21] of you have seen this before but you
[51:25] know I wish so bad I could have been
[51:26] there in that in that service because
[51:28] he'll point to it and he'll refer to it
[51:31] the Prophet does and boy I just I wish I
[51:33] could see exactly what he's what he's
[51:35] pointing at but you get an idea and and
[51:38] you know God protects his word so I just
[51:41] believe that we can catch that by
[51:42] revelation so if you just leave that up
[51:44] just for a moment and then and then you
[51:46] could shut it off so notice it's a
[51:49] pyramid to this thing to this stature
[51:51] the Prophet uses a pyramid and it would
[51:54] seem peculiar to use this but
[51:58] again in studying this you know just
[52:01] asking the Lord why you know why is it
[52:04] this way you'll notice how a pyramid
[52:08] gets smaller up at the top and it
[52:11] becomes it becomes tighter it becomes
[52:15] more honed okay it's coming to a point
[52:20] to be capped now if you want to shut
[52:26] that off to preserve the the bulbs on
[52:28] that that's fine lots of people have
[52:30] faith in various things that foundation
[52:33] is faith you have to have that
[52:35] foundation a lot of people have faith
[52:38] there's there's we might not say it's
[52:40] the right kind of faith but they have
[52:42] faith in something and many people have
[52:46] faith in God okay we could say they have
[52:49] faith in God but so that's why I believe
[52:53] that it's such a wide base not only a
[52:56] wide base is good for building off of
[52:58] but I believe that there you could say
[53:01] that there's there's a greater category
[53:03] of a group of people that would fall
[53:05] into this if that's all right to say
[53:09] sincere people believing having faith
[53:13] because they believe what they say is
[53:15] right there their faith produces a
[53:18] sincerity just just like us okay so now
[53:22] we can put us all on the same playing
[53:23] field but there is a distinction between
[53:26] the bride as you move towards the top of
[53:30] the pyramid next is virtue and virtue
[53:33] the Prophet says his power or strength
[53:35] if you remember when the woman touched
[53:37] the hem of His garment he says I felt
[53:39] virtue go out of me it was strength he
[53:42] felt himself get weak it was it was it
[53:45] was power leaving him and she received
[53:48] her healing now another interesting
[53:50] thing about this is you have faith on
[53:52] the bottom in in love at the top to cap
[53:55] it and it and it seems like as you study
[54:00] this it's almost like faith and the
[54:03] Prophet says this he says it comes up
[54:06] it's like he says refers to the bride
[54:08] tree he said it just seems to come up
[54:10] through the whole thing
[54:11] but as faith is pushing up from the
[54:14] bottom it's almost like charity is
[54:16] reaching down from the top grabbing a
[54:18] hope and pulling it up and you'll notice
[54:21] you know the pyramid is so perfectly
[54:23] formed and I try to pay attention to the
[54:26] time my getting and getting excited now
[54:28] so so you'll see the the pyramid is is
[54:34] so perfectly is so perfectly honed and
[54:38] shaped that you can't even fit a razor
[54:40] blade through it and it's interesting I
[54:43] was thinking about this I'm just just
[54:46] here for this service and I and I
[54:48] thought you know each of these just just
[54:50] seemed to mesh so perfectly you almost
[54:53] can't have one without the other it's
[54:56] one again one's reaching up and the
[54:58] others reaching down and they grab a
[55:00] hole and just kind of pull up and cinch
[55:02] it tight and it's it's performed and
[55:05] it's because I guess is because it's
[55:08] performing one being its its building
[55:10] one being its it's gonna be one one
[55:14] perfect man one perfect body and so
[55:18] that's why I believe it's it's happening
[55:19] that way and so I'm saying all this for
[55:24] a purpose hopefully it's not just
[55:25] rambling here so and you'll see faith
[55:32] faith and then virtue these are so
[55:34] perfectly in order faith and virtue so
[55:37] faith is going to come up so that
[55:39] there's power to heal there's there's
[55:42] there's power behind the faith and a lot
[55:46] of people a lot of people can have power
[55:47] power power too you could say power to
[55:50] heal power to bring an anointing down in
[55:53] a service power to bring an anointing
[55:57] and then there's they're speaking in
[55:58] tongues and and many congregations are
[56:01] feeling the same thing we feel here this
[56:03] morning but the one thing that they're
[56:05] lacking is power to live in overcoming
[56:07] life and that's that's what we want
[56:10] virtue for and by you living an
[56:13] overcoming life the Prophet talks about
[56:16] a lily upon lily and he says you know
[56:18] the the passerby is they behold it and
[56:23] it's beautiful and that Lily gives of
[56:25] itself freely in it and it's its power
[56:28] you have to have power to give to others
[56:30] and by you living and overcoming life
[56:32] somebody's gonna look on your life and
[56:35] say hey I can live it - amen I can live
[56:39] it - so now it's not only power for
[56:42] yourself it's virtue for others it gives
[56:45] out to to others watching your life but
[56:49] you see that group gets smaller it gets
[56:53] smaller your manner of conversation is a
[57:01] pretty big giveaway I want to focus this
[57:03] morning on temperance when we get to it
[57:05] but I just these are so good I can't let
[57:07] all of them go so your manner of
[57:13] conversation and this will make sense in
[57:15] a minute is a pretty big giveaway for
[57:17] people to know whether or not they can
[57:19] draw from your life by what comes out of
[57:22] your mouth
[57:23] you know when when the scripture talks
[57:24] about conversation it's more than what
[57:26] comes out of your mouth it's a life
[57:31] virtue it doesn't complain when others
[57:34] draw from it it's there to freely give
[57:37] so next next is knowledge and knowledge
[57:42] to me it seems I found is a pretty
[57:45] important element here and but it also
[57:51] seems to be where many people stop is on
[57:55] knowledge you can talk to somebody and
[57:59] boy they can they can lay it out they
[58:02] can you know maybe they could lay out
[58:04] the mysteries better than you could and
[58:06] and there's just they have a way with
[58:09] words and they seem so intellectual but
[58:11] what what what came to mind and maybe I
[58:14] heard this before I don't know but I
[58:16] just haven't written down that there's
[58:18] three kinds of knowledge
[58:22] worldly knowledge or intellect
[58:25] and and really God doesn't need to be in
[58:29] that they can have that and be super
[58:32] smart you know we would say engineers
[58:36] and architects and and those kind of
[58:39] things but really whatever you do for a
[58:41] living you might have a knowledge in
[58:43] that that somebody else doesn't have so
[58:45] you have a form of knowledge there's
[58:48] another kind of knowledge knowledge of
[58:53] God okay now understand what I'm saying
[58:56] knowledge of God you might know who he
[58:59] is somebody might know who he is they
[59:02] know of God they've they've they've
[59:04] heard of this man called Jesus before
[59:06] okay you understand what I'm saying but
[59:10] there's a deeper kind of knowledge and I
[59:12] believe that this is what this kind of
[59:13] knowledge is and that's that's an a
[59:17] heaven-born knowledge it's it's knowing
[59:22] God by revelation you could say knowing
[59:27] knowing the scripture would say you know
[59:31] talk about a man and he and he knew his
[59:33] wife it's an intimacy and can you
[59:36] understand it's an intimacy and it's
[59:42] revelation there's a there's a group
[59:45] that'll be set aside again why we're
[59:48] getting smaller on this pyramid is
[59:50] because there's a smaller group that
[59:52] God's going to share his heart with and
[59:54] it's going to be an intimate
[59:55] communication amen job said I have heard
[1:00:01] but now I see this last one has love in
[1:00:06] it okay and you'll start seeing how love
[1:00:09] just just kind of starts trickling down
[1:00:12] in here to bring these up the Prophet
[1:00:19] there says it's it's knowledge to judge
[1:00:21] right from wrong to judge that the word
[1:00:23] is right to believe the Word of God when
[1:00:26] you could punctuate the Word of God with
[1:00:28] Amen something that's coming from your
[1:00:30] mouth okay from your heart but out of
[1:00:34] your mouth so we're up at temperance
[1:00:38] and it's getting smaller now there seem
[1:00:45] to be some kind of breach here again
[1:00:48] like I said many people can can fit into
[1:00:51] that knowledge category a lot of people
[1:00:52] have knowledge but there seems to be a
[1:00:54] breach and going forward on to on to
[1:00:58] temperance and let me just catch my
[1:01:02] place here forgive me
[1:01:07] so once it crosses once you once you
[1:01:14] start building off of knowledge you
[1:01:17] start coming into something that that it
[1:01:20] starts getting into a behavior okay then
[1:01:23] I believe this is important it expresses
[1:01:28] the nature of Christ you you you no
[1:01:30] longer you can have faith and and I
[1:01:33] believe it will manifest itself but it
[1:01:35] could be it's not really seen I don't
[1:01:37] see your faith virtue it might manifest
[1:01:41] itself in something visible but I don't
[1:01:43] see you have virtue I don't see you have
[1:01:45] knowledge but temperance I'm gonna
[1:01:47] notice okay temperance I'm going to
[1:01:51] notice it you'll start expressing it the
[1:01:58] breach I believe is that true revelation
[1:02:00] I believe it's true revelation has love
[1:02:05] and grace in it you'll never you'll
[1:02:07] never have a revelation and belittle
[1:02:10] somebody else who maybe doesn't have the
[1:02:13] revelation you have with revelation
[1:02:16] comes humility and and and you'll notice
[1:02:20] that starts separating categories now
[1:02:23] that starts separating people out of
[1:02:25] what true knowledge is they may seem
[1:02:28] like they have a form of it but it's not
[1:02:30] the truth and and I wonder if we can
[1:02:35] just turn with me here to first
[1:02:37] Corinthians 13
[1:02:51] first Corinthians 13 and verse one are
[1:02:59] you getting something this morning okay
[1:03:02] amen
[1:03:03] first Corinthians 13 verse one watch
[1:03:07] this now though I speak with the tongues
[1:03:10] of men and of angels and have not
[1:03:11] charity I am becoming a sounding brass
[1:03:14] or a tinkling cymbal really if you don't
[1:03:18] mind me using the expression this person
[1:03:21] who who can do this and not have charity
[1:03:24] is just annoying and they're just what
[1:03:27] they're saying it just becomes annoying
[1:03:29] and though I have the gift of prophecy
[1:03:32] and listen now and understand all
[1:03:34] mysteries and all knowledge and though I
[1:03:37] have all faith so we just covered the
[1:03:40] bottom of this pyramid and have not
[1:03:44] charity I'm nothing and though I bestow
[1:03:49] all my goods to feed the poor and though
[1:03:51] I give my body to be burned and have not
[1:03:53] charity it profiteth me nothing now I
[1:03:56] want you to just catch something and
[1:03:58] I'll make a point here and move on
[1:03:59] charity suffereth long and is kind now
[1:04:05] when you see that pyramid in in the
[1:04:08] stature what's in it brotherly kindness
[1:04:11] charity suffereth long it's patient so
[1:04:16] you start seeing over here in this love
[1:04:18] chapter can't remember how I got here
[1:04:20] those questions about love what is that
[1:04:23] I loved of mine you start seeing these
[1:04:27] things pop up in the stature of a
[1:04:29] perfect man but what the difference is
[1:04:32] and in this may or may not excite you
[1:04:35] just at this moment but over there in
[1:04:38] that stature these are all nouns okay if
[1:04:41] you look at them they're nouns okay a
[1:04:44] noun is just it's it's what it is it's
[1:04:46] it's a thing it's it's a it's a speaker
[1:04:49] it's it's a bench right over here and
[1:04:52] charity when in this love chapter when
[1:04:54] it's when Paul speaking of charity
[1:04:55] they're actually verbs
[1:04:57] it's an action ok so knowledge you can
[1:05:01] have knowledge and great but without
[1:05:04] chair
[1:05:05] it's it's just annoying right but there
[1:05:08] has to be a power behind it that's
[1:05:10] actually expressing it that's actually
[1:05:13] doing something for the kingdom of God
[1:05:16] so so we're at temperance and I just add
[1:05:25] a little something here and I'm just um
[1:05:28] just trying to decide whether to go into
[1:05:31] it now we're not your forgive me I'm a
[1:05:36] I'm a young minister I'm young in the
[1:05:40] ministry so just bear with me a lot of
[1:05:48] veterans who have paved the way I'm
[1:05:51] gonna go I'm will go ahead and go into
[1:05:53] it cuz this has been pressing on my
[1:05:55] heart and I just found this some time
[1:05:57] ago and I tell you it just it really
[1:05:59] says a lot to a body of believers where
[1:06:03] the random says and this is I believe
[1:06:06] it's Christ the mystery love one another
[1:06:08] above everything love one another don't
[1:06:12] no matter what the devil tries to say I
[1:06:15] want you to listen closely okay now
[1:06:18] you're all one great big sweet group now
[1:06:21] but remember my warning see Satan won't
[1:06:24] let that stay that way no sir
[1:06:28] he'll shoot everything if he has to
[1:06:30] bring somebody in to make his target
[1:06:32] he'll bring some critic or unbeliever in
[1:06:34] and set him down and because and caused
[1:06:37] him to fellowship with you under the
[1:06:38] quietness and things and then he'll
[1:06:40] shoot that guy with some kind of a
[1:06:42] poison stuff and he'll start through the
[1:06:44] church with it now just bear with me
[1:06:48] I do believe the Lord will help me tie
[1:06:50] this in he'll start through the church
[1:06:55] with it don't you take sides with it
[1:06:57] don't you have nothing to do with
[1:06:59] anything else you stay right loving and
[1:07:02] sweet and kind to one another
[1:07:03] pray for that man or that woman that
[1:07:06] he'll be saved too or that woman or
[1:07:08] whatever it is just pray for them and
[1:07:10] stick with one another and stay with
[1:07:13] your pastor
[1:07:15] see he's the Shepherd and you give him
[1:07:18] respects listen now he'll lead you
[1:07:21] through and cuz he's ordained of God to
[1:07:26] do so now I'm gonna get ahead of myself
[1:07:29] a little bit and I just want to read a
[1:07:31] little bit further but I just this has
[1:07:33] been pulsating on my heart and you know
[1:07:38] you forgive me but it's a sweet group of
[1:07:41] people so I don't know if this is for
[1:07:43] somebody for someone something down the
[1:07:45] road or what it is but he says you're
[1:07:49] your shepherd your pastor he's ordained
[1:07:51] to lead you through now we're talking
[1:07:54] about temperance and temperance is you
[1:07:57] would think of something as as
[1:07:59] temperance as in not not drinking
[1:08:02] temperance do you stop drinking
[1:08:04] you would think tempers but temperance
[1:08:06] the Prophet says is self-control but
[1:08:10] what interested me was there's a lot of
[1:08:12] things you know and he mentions you know
[1:08:14] controlling your temper and things but
[1:08:16] what he talks about the most is your
[1:08:17] tongue and your conversation and that
[1:08:21] and this is this is where I'm getting
[1:08:22] into my thought for the day finally
[1:08:25] because you watch is the Prophet here he
[1:08:28] says he'll he'll Satan he'll bring
[1:08:31] somebody in he'll sit them down they'll
[1:08:33] start fellowshipping and then they'll
[1:08:34] inject the poison and how is somebody
[1:08:38] going to inject the poison it could be
[1:08:40] with an attitude a little bit but
[1:08:43] eventually it's going to start spilling
[1:08:44] out of their mouth and I'll tell you one
[1:08:47] thing that I found is that that poison
[1:08:51] will start attacking the pastor because
[1:08:53] he's ordained to lead you through and so
[1:08:56] if Satan can attack the pastor and get
[1:08:59] you to look outside of that or get you
[1:09:01] to get something to raise up against him
[1:09:03] then you're defeated and and that you
[1:09:07] know we've seen divisions we've seen
[1:09:09] we've heard of them and in many think
[1:09:11] church splits and things and and many
[1:09:13] times probably it could be back to
[1:09:16] somebody talking too much
[1:09:17] can you say Amen and so you know maybe
[1:09:22] the older ones you're established and
[1:09:24] and you don't need this but for you
[1:09:27] younger ones you watch what you say
[1:09:29] especially towards the pastor but not
[1:09:31] just the pastor now this is the body of
[1:09:34] Christ so if you speak against one
[1:09:36] another you're actually speaking against
[1:09:38] Christ can you say Amen and so these are
[1:09:43] very very important things because they
[1:09:46] can cause so much detriment and you
[1:09:49] might have you might have knowledge you
[1:09:53] might have faith you might have a gift
[1:09:56] of healing you might have that virtue
[1:09:58] flowing through your life but if you
[1:09:59] can't control this little member the
[1:10:02] Paul says you're nothing so we want to
[1:10:08] be careful and you know I just I just
[1:10:12] say I just want to tell you I appreciate
[1:10:14] you you the pastor's office is beautiful
[1:10:18] and you know I believe I believe you
[1:10:20] made it that way for them and I just
[1:10:21] want to say thank you because it's
[1:10:25] important it is important it's it's
[1:10:28] something special so now do you remember
[1:10:32] that congregation says amen the enemy
[1:10:35] will come and when he does just clinch
[1:10:37] that much closer together and the one
[1:10:40] that the devil is using for an enemy
[1:10:42] will either get out or come in and be
[1:10:44] one of you that's all pray for him don't
[1:10:48] never clan among you or talk make
[1:10:51] yourself clannish we are one I couldn't
[1:10:54] say left hand I'm mad at you I'm going
[1:10:56] to take you away cuz you're not a right
[1:10:58] hand
[1:10:58] he's my left hand I want him to stay
[1:11:01] there even the little tip of my finger I
[1:11:04] want to stay right there
[1:11:05] every little part of the body stay right
[1:11:08] there and God wants us as a body of
[1:11:10] believers to stay right exactly with one
[1:11:13] another right at with one another so you
[1:11:16] may feel little and insignificant don't
[1:11:20] feel that way you you might be in in the
[1:11:24] analogy here you might be a little tip
[1:11:26] of the finger but I like the tip of my
[1:11:29] finger you know we know people who have
[1:11:33] who have they've lost it you know
[1:11:36] whether it's through a door or whatever
[1:11:38] it is you know a saw there's a lot of
[1:11:41] construction
[1:11:42] I just pray the Lord keep the tip of
[1:11:44] your finger cuz we like him but the
[1:11:51] bigger picture here is is the body of
[1:11:53] Christ it's it's the body you know if
[1:11:57] one of you you notice one of you is kind
[1:12:00] of stepping back a little bit and
[1:12:03] there's a little bit of distance reach
[1:12:04] out to him reach out to him and try to
[1:12:07] encourage them try to bring them back
[1:12:08] amen
[1:12:12] all right I'm just gonna continue on
[1:12:19] because this has some good things and I
[1:12:21] think the pastor would appreciate it and
[1:12:23] now you've got tapes on that you've got
[1:12:25] tapes on what we believe you've got
[1:12:27] tapes on discipline in the church how we
[1:12:29] behave ourselves in the church how we
[1:12:31] got to come here together and sit
[1:12:33] together in heavenly places if you look
[1:12:35] at well let me just continue and then
[1:12:37] I'll make that comment if God don't stay
[1:12:41] at home if God is in your heart you
[1:12:43] can't hardly wait for them doors to open
[1:12:45] out yonder to get in there to fellowship
[1:12:48] with your brothers if you don't feel
[1:12:50] that way then I tell you it's time you
[1:12:52] get to praying if you look at coming to
[1:12:55] church is just coming to church it's
[1:12:58] just no I got to get up and go to church
[1:12:59] again you're looking at it wrong when we
[1:13:02] come the scripture says we're seated now
[1:13:05] in heavenly places right now right when
[1:13:09] you congregate together that's that's
[1:13:10] you're bringing a little lick of fire
[1:13:12] and you come together and you make one
[1:13:15] big bonfire we're coming into the colder
[1:13:17] weather and we like to be warm
[1:13:19] bring your lick of fire together that
[1:13:21] encourages you we just had a campout and
[1:13:24] you know the story of that that pastor I
[1:13:28] don't know it real well so I'm gonna
[1:13:29] paraphrase a little and if I get it
[1:13:31] wrong forgive me we'll catch the thought
[1:13:33] behind it and the pastor comes to this
[1:13:35] gentleman this brothers house who hasn't
[1:13:36] been around
[1:13:37] quit quit coming or not coming around
[1:13:39] much and the pastor comes in and they
[1:13:42] sit down and I don't think they said
[1:13:43] much they're just looking at the fire in
[1:13:45] the fireplace and when a piece of the
[1:13:48] log a coal or an ember fell out and it
[1:13:51] fizzled out it quit burning and it just
[1:13:54] kind of smoldering and smoking
[1:13:56] and the pastor got up and he picked it
[1:13:58] up with the tongs and put it back into
[1:14:00] the fire and when he did it caught it
[1:14:02] ignited the pastor went back and sat
[1:14:05] down got up and said god bless you and
[1:14:10] walked out it just preached the
[1:14:12] fireplace just preached the whole
[1:14:14] service everything he wanted to say was
[1:14:16] just said by the fire and so this
[1:14:18] happened at the at the campout we had
[1:14:21] this piece of law you know not not too
[1:14:23] thick but about like that falls out and
[1:14:26] immediately it goes out it quits glowing
[1:14:29] and it's just a little bit of smoke and
[1:14:30] then the smoke disappears and so I kind
[1:14:35] of grabbed it and I threw it back up in
[1:14:36] there and as soon as I did I mean as as
[1:14:39] soon as it it's like it almost got just
[1:14:40] close to the fire and it ignited and
[1:14:42] then I took a log that had it been on
[1:14:45] the fire okay you catching when I'm
[1:14:48] laying down here and I picked up a log
[1:14:51] to add to it and as soon as it got on
[1:14:54] the fire it sat there for a minute and
[1:14:55] it was it caught fire that quick and so
[1:14:59] it is important to come to church you
[1:15:03] you'll fizzle out just like that log
[1:15:06] that Ember you'll fizzle out and die
[1:15:09] spiritually keep coming to church the
[1:15:14] Fellowship of the Saints is important
[1:15:26] okay I think we'll just
[1:15:34] can we keep going in this do you mind
[1:15:36] okay because we're in the last days
[1:15:41] where the Bible exhorted much more as we
[1:15:44] see the Day approaching to love one
[1:15:47] another with Christian love and divine
[1:15:48] love to assemble ourselves together in
[1:15:50] heavenly places in Christ Jesus and love
[1:15:53] one another this will all man know that
[1:15:56] you are my disciples when you have loved
[1:15:58] one for the other that's right
[1:15:59] stay right together if the brother you
[1:16:01] think he's wrong or the sisters say Lord
[1:16:04] don't listen now don't let me never have
[1:16:09] the root of bitterness spring up because
[1:16:11] it'll affect him it'll affect that
[1:16:14] brother it'll take Christ right out of
[1:16:16] my life
[1:16:17] that poison acid of malice and jealousy
[1:16:21] and hatred that will just take the Holy
[1:16:23] Spirit right away from you it will run
[1:16:26] him from the Tabernacle here speaking of
[1:16:28] Christ it'll kill the Spirit of God or
[1:16:32] drive it away from here it'll hurt your
[1:16:34] pastor it'll do everything seed don't
[1:16:38] you do that you just wax that much
[1:16:40] closer together drop take the buckle as
[1:16:43] the brother testified of the other night
[1:16:45] just that buck was on the whole armor of
[1:16:48] God just pull her up tighten it up
[1:16:50] move right up close to one another love
[1:16:52] one another anyhow listen where he goes
[1:16:54] talk nice about one another say nice
[1:16:58] things about one another and then God
[1:17:01] will bless you interesting all from the
[1:17:06] little member here goodness time is
[1:17:12] going
[1:17:17] let's let's turn to James together
[1:17:27] I've got some encouraging things at the
[1:17:29] end here I want to get to but there's so
[1:17:31] much air left
[1:17:40] James chapter 3 will read verse 2 I told
[1:17:50] you what the Prophet said about
[1:17:51] temperance and I have it read it yet so
[1:17:52] hopefully you're with me are you there
[1:17:57] so you men amen
[1:17:58] verse 2 for in many things we offend all
[1:18:02] If any man offend not in word the same
[1:18:07] is what a perfect man and able also to
[1:18:15] bridle the whole body now I'm gonna put
[1:18:17] this little drop this little thing and
[1:18:19] I'm not gonna read the next verse but it
[1:18:20] talks about bridling a horse and maybe
[1:18:22] somebody knows I don't have a horse so
[1:18:26] if you have I'm sure you know more than
[1:18:28] I do but as I was studying these things
[1:18:31] I found it interesting to find that a
[1:18:34] course is Bridal if that horse is
[1:18:37] trained correctly okay that that bit
[1:18:40] that's in the horse's mouth you know if
[1:18:42] you ever ridden a horse in in you know
[1:18:45] in ironing experience who don't write
[1:18:47] him much you might when you want the
[1:18:49] horse to turn you'll pull real hard you
[1:18:51] know you'll you'll kind of really pull
[1:18:53] back or however you want to do or when
[1:18:55] you want the horse to stop whoa and
[1:18:57] you'll kind of try to lift its head up
[1:18:59] but actually a horse the most sensitive
[1:19:02] part of its body is right around its
[1:19:05] mouth and it comes they kind of come
[1:19:07] through the nose the nerve endings and
[1:19:09] right around the mouth and so really you
[1:19:11] could turn that horse if it's properly
[1:19:13] chained and the in the writer is is
[1:19:16] knows what they're doing you can turn
[1:19:19] that horse by just lifting one finger
[1:19:21] and pulling that rein out a little bit
[1:19:23] that horse will feel that that touch and
[1:19:26] it'll turn and so James uses that as as
[1:19:31] I guess if I'm saying it right an
[1:19:33] analogy to get his point across it's
[1:19:36] it's by just a bit we're able to turn
[1:19:39] this whole massive body okay so let's
[1:19:43] let's read here verse 13 who is a wise
[1:19:47] man and endued with knowledge among you
[1:19:49] let him show out of a good conversation
[1:19:51] his works with meekness of wisdom
[1:19:54] but if ye have bitter envying and strife
[1:19:56] in your hearts
[1:19:58] glory not and lie not against the truth
[1:20:01] this wisdom descendeth not from above
[1:20:04] but is earthly sensual and devilish for
[1:20:08] we're envying and strife is there is
[1:20:10] confusion and every evil work but the
[1:20:12] wisdom that is from above is first pure
[1:20:14] then peaceable gentle and easy to be
[1:20:17] intreated full of mercy and good fruits
[1:20:19] without partiality and without hypocrisy
[1:20:23] why because you can say something and
[1:20:25] that's not what's really on your heart
[1:20:28] and a lot of times you might be able to
[1:20:31] slip by but in the words of the Prophet
[1:20:34] by-and-by it'll manifest your heart will
[1:20:38] manifest and the fruit of righteousness
[1:20:42] is sown in peace of them that make peace
[1:20:44] so it's interesting he's talking about
[1:20:47] our mouth he's talking about our words
[1:20:49] and and we can make peace okay that's
[1:20:54] I'm gonna have to skip some of this I
[1:20:55] believe
[1:21:01] you know there's there's there must be
[1:21:07] discernment in our conversation and I
[1:21:14] believe that this is a key element of
[1:21:16] temperance
[1:21:16] there must be discernment somebody might
[1:21:19] ask you a question but you need to be
[1:21:22] discerning of the spirit behind that
[1:21:24] question you need to discern your own
[1:21:27] heart of why you're saying what you're
[1:21:29] saying what's what's your motive what's
[1:21:33] your objective because it is important
[1:21:36] that's that's hypocrisy in your heart if
[1:21:38] you're saying one thing but in your
[1:21:40] heart you're meaning another and we all
[1:21:42] do it
[1:21:42] just be honest we're all in the flesh
[1:21:46] amen
[1:21:47] I raise both hands I'd do it we don't
[1:21:49] want to if a believer doesn't want to
[1:21:52] but but we do do it
[1:21:54] so Ephesians 4 and I was gonna read it
[1:21:58] but I'm just gonna skip it for time sake
[1:22:01] well I guess I'm gonna read it that
[1:22:04] don't corrupt communication proceed out
[1:22:06] of your mouth but that which is good to
[1:22:09] the use of edifying that it may Minister
[1:22:11] grace into the ears corrupt something
[1:22:17] that's corrupt is is it's of no use
[1:22:20] that's of no use edifying is building up
[1:22:24] let that which is edifying come out of
[1:22:27] your mouth you know you got you all have
[1:22:30] been doing beautiful work here I just
[1:22:31] admire and this is just gorgeous and you
[1:22:35] know as as you kind of board you may be
[1:22:37] you know you're gonna cut a board and
[1:22:38] put up the wall there and so you cut it
[1:22:40] and you have a little piece left over
[1:22:41] it's it's corrupt there's no use for it
[1:22:45] you throw it away but you're building
[1:22:47] you're building something and and Paul
[1:22:52] says here we want to build it and throw
[1:22:54] away the excess throw away what's not
[1:22:57] needed what's not edifying amen
[1:23:09] let me just um are you all doing okay
[1:23:16] okay I believe this this is important to
[1:23:20] hit also so in talking about our
[1:23:23] communication our conversation we live
[1:23:26] in the 21st century I think we're still
[1:23:29] there there's a lot of new forms of
[1:23:34] communication email texting I won't I'm
[1:23:41] gonna say social media and I'm gonna try
[1:23:42] and stay off of it because I I do see
[1:23:47] the benefit of it I do see the benefit
[1:23:49] of texting but if that's all you're
[1:23:52] doing you're losing you're missing an
[1:23:54] important element called relationship
[1:23:57] yes we text one another yes there's
[1:24:00] there's social media to you know stay
[1:24:03] connected in things but it's it's it's a
[1:24:06] false sense if that's all you're doing
[1:24:08] you need you need interaction you need
[1:24:11] to get together they meant it's an
[1:24:13] important part but so we can talk about
[1:24:16] the Prophet talked about our tongue but
[1:24:19] we're living here some I think it is 50
[1:24:22] years later we need to bring it up to
[1:24:26] speed we need to bring it up to our time
[1:24:28] so now you can you can text and that
[1:24:31] person doesn't see your body language
[1:24:32] they don't hear the tone of your voice
[1:24:35] so it's a lot easier to try and sneak
[1:24:39] something in to manipulate to show
[1:24:44] yourself friendly but in your heart you
[1:24:45] can't stand that person it's a lot
[1:24:50] easier nowadays so we have to bring it
[1:24:53] up to speed we have to bring it up to
[1:24:55] our day and and don't get me wrong I I
[1:24:57] have like I said I have seen social
[1:25:00] media be a good tool but most of it the
[1:25:05] rest of it as a garbage can and we'll
[1:25:11] still be friends after that
[1:25:17] there should be some benefit from the
[1:25:19] conversation there should be some
[1:25:22] benefit from what you're posting on
[1:25:24] Facebook there should be some benefit or
[1:25:27] whatever other forms of social media I
[1:25:29] know there's snapchat and things you
[1:25:31] know that the you know young people hope
[1:25:36] that you that us older ones don't start
[1:25:38] catching on to the new what's new
[1:25:39] because then if we don't say it they can
[1:25:41] let it slide a little bit but there's
[1:25:43] snapchat Twitter all those things we'll
[1:25:45] just throw it all in so so you can't get
[1:25:48] around it there should be some positive
[1:25:54] deposit something edifying something
[1:25:57] that builds up we're gonna have listen
[1:26:00] we're gonna have we don't we don't have
[1:26:03] to how do I want to say this there's
[1:26:07] gonna be like conversation okay and you
[1:26:10] shouldn't feel bad for that the problem
[1:26:14] and where we need to examine ourselves
[1:26:15] if it's if it's always like if you can't
[1:26:19] go deep why can't you go deep you need
[1:26:22] to examine yourself why can't you go
[1:26:24] deep why can't you talk about deeper
[1:26:25] things why you know if someone says hey
[1:26:28] how you doing and oh good and then you
[1:26:30] you know you're throwing a joke why'd
[1:26:32] you do that it it may seem I'm not
[1:26:37] trying to go off on some psychology
[1:26:40] thing okay I'm asking you because
[1:26:43] nowadays there's so many there's so many
[1:26:46] hurts and things that that do affect our
[1:26:48] spiritual walk and and they do affect
[1:26:50] our our unity and so and I don't know
[1:26:54] I'm just letting it flow now so you know
[1:26:58] why why do you do that why do you put up
[1:27:00] a wall you should examine your
[1:27:03] relationships what what walls are around
[1:27:07] you and and and be prayerful what can we
[1:27:09] do to bring those walls down because I'm
[1:27:11] going to tell you this as we as you as
[1:27:14] you climb this pyramid what do we get
[1:27:15] into brotherly kindness we get into
[1:27:18] charity
[1:27:18] it's expressions you're gonna be in
[1:27:21] heaven with one another okay we're going
[1:27:25] to be
[1:27:26] we're part of the kingdom of God now but
[1:27:29] we're going to rule and reign over there
[1:27:31] with one another I don't think we should
[1:27:35] have the mindset that just because we
[1:27:37] know that one day we'll be over there
[1:27:39] and everything's perfect over there What
[1:27:41] did he say only divine love enters over
[1:27:44] there so if only divine love goes you
[1:27:47] must have something now right we must
[1:27:50] have love divine now and we want those
[1:27:52] things pulsating in our heart we want to
[1:27:55] be the stature of a perfect man and a
[1:27:57] perfect woman now so I just ask you a
[1:28:06] challenging question ask yourself how
[1:28:10] much would you have to talk about if you
[1:28:13] didn't talk about others or negative
[1:28:16] things and keep that in mind when we
[1:28:20] converse okay now I don't think I'm
[1:28:26] gonna get to reading in out of the
[1:28:27] stature of a perfect man where he talks
[1:28:30] about temperance but it go go if you get
[1:28:33] the opportunity go and look just for
[1:28:35] times sake I'm going to admit it here go
[1:28:38] look up where he talks about temperance
[1:28:39] where he introduces it it's real short
[1:28:41] it's some but it's it's solid it'll make
[1:28:45] you think okay but I just want to give
[1:28:48] some encouraging things now alright so
[1:28:55] in second Peter are you with me for a
[1:28:57] little bit longer in second Peter he
[1:29:01] says give diligence and add so if you're
[1:29:05] like me my personality is okay then then
[1:29:10] man I fail every day how do I add how do
[1:29:14] I give how do I give diligence to this
[1:29:16] thing what do I do
[1:29:17] watch these words giving all diligence
[1:29:20] add me Lee interest oneself more
[1:29:26] earnestly
[1:29:27] oh wait wait wait on the Lord interest
[1:29:32] oneself most eagerly you're seeking
[1:29:35] you're desiring your heart is to be the
[1:29:37] stature of a perfect man and woman
[1:29:40] desire earnestly furnish add or minister
[1:29:46] nourishment unto in other words feed
[1:29:52] your experience what do you do what do
[1:29:55] you do what's your part in building the
[1:29:58] stature what's your part to come into
[1:30:00] the image of Christ feed on the word
[1:30:02] feed on the word he says now remember
[1:30:06] the black bird with peacock feathers he
[1:30:09] says in the earlier on he said so you
[1:30:10] know some people can can have these
[1:30:12] things and they exhibit them and and
[1:30:13] they don't actually have the nature of
[1:30:15] Christ in them it's like a it's like a
[1:30:17] black bird trying to put peacock
[1:30:19] feathers so that's what he's referring
[1:30:20] to here don't forget them see don't try
[1:30:23] to add it till you're actually born
[1:30:25] again because it won't work you can't
[1:30:28] make it work it'll crumble somewhere but
[1:30:32] when you get down here
[1:30:33] a genuine born-again dove that you don't
[1:30:36] add nothing it adds to you and comes up
[1:30:40] all right
[1:30:41] coming into perfection now says this
[1:30:44] always put in before you remember it was
[1:30:47] he that made the promise and God is able
[1:30:49] to keep everything he promised if you
[1:30:52] see it in the Bible and you believe it
[1:30:54] then forget it that's all it's all over
[1:30:56] have patience if you've done what he
[1:31:01] said and it seems like it went wrong
[1:31:03] stand still be patient the key always
[1:31:07] set him before you and there's only one
[1:31:12] thing you can to tune up that's the
[1:31:14] scripture to tune you up the Holy
[1:31:17] Scripture in the scripture to you bring
[1:31:19] you directly into the target again
[1:31:20] that's right he says a living power
[1:31:24] coming from a living God making a living
[1:31:26] a living man a living image in the
[1:31:29] stature of God what are all these things
[1:31:31] it takes you completely out of the
[1:31:33] equation be patient stand still keep him
[1:31:39] before you if you're if you're do we
[1:31:43] have hunters in here any hunters a
[1:31:46] couple okay
[1:31:50] we'll say we'll make it we want to grab
[1:31:53] everyone here you're driving down the
[1:31:55] road you're driving down the road and
[1:31:59] we'll say we'll say there's a building a
[1:32:02] mile ahead and you're driving towards
[1:32:05] that building you need to keep that
[1:32:08] building in your sight and then your
[1:32:10] focus the whole time in order to get
[1:32:12] there drive towards that building like
[1:32:14] this and get there you know the the
[1:32:18] vehicle just the tires and things
[1:32:22] that'll throw you off you won't hit your
[1:32:24] target if you keep Christ before you
[1:32:26] keep walking forward keep your eyes on
[1:32:29] Christ you will succeed you will make it
[1:32:33] this stature will manifest itself in
[1:32:36] your life I want you to be encouraged
[1:32:40] this morning and then he says and I'm
[1:32:45] getting ready to close if the musicians
[1:32:47] want to go ahead and come on up you
[1:32:51] could stand to your feet and then we
[1:32:56] ourselves can prostrate ourselves give
[1:32:58] ourselves up until God takes his
[1:33:00] transfusion to the name of Jesus Christ
[1:33:02] because there's no other name under
[1:33:04] heaven whereby man can be saved and
[1:33:06] transfers the life of Christ into us
[1:33:08] then we have this kind of faith the
[1:33:11] faith that Christ had and then when we
[1:33:15] can get so transfused by his power that
[1:33:18] we die to our own thinking so the last
[1:33:21] party says give ourselves up this time
[1:33:24] he says die to our thinking and our
[1:33:26] faith becomes a genuine faith hallelujah
[1:33:29] then the life of Christ is transfused
[1:33:31] into us we become living creatures of
[1:33:33] God a dwelling place where the Holy
[1:33:36] Spirit can send his radiant blessings
[1:33:38] down through there and we're in the
[1:33:39] stature of Christ
[1:33:43] so it's Christ in you that it almost
[1:33:46] seems it almost seems hard to fathom but
[1:33:52] it's Christ in you manifesting himself
[1:33:55] through you all's you have to do is is
[1:34:00] you know brother Branham said a gift is
[1:34:02] getting out of the way that's all you
[1:34:06] have to do just get out of the way it's
[1:34:10] learning how to get out of the way die
[1:34:14] to your own thinking give up your own
[1:34:17] thinking when you see a promise in the
[1:34:20] word and it says or you hear the
[1:34:23] prophets say you are the sinless bride
[1:34:25] of Jesus Christ your thinking is gonna
[1:34:28] come in Satan's just gonna Satan's just
[1:34:30] gonna try to try to throw something out
[1:34:32] in front of you
[1:34:33] yeah that's everyone but me everyone
[1:34:36] else at church
[1:34:37] that's your promise that's yours
[1:34:42] by faith take a hold of the precious
[1:34:46] promise and it'll manifest itself in
[1:34:49] your life and if you say brother I don't
[1:34:52] have that faith this morning I'm
[1:34:54] struggling I'm struggling stand still be
[1:35:00] still it's so contrary to everything in
[1:35:02] this life be still be patient
[1:35:07] I brought I brought a little
[1:35:09] illustration for you I hope you don't
[1:35:14] mind standing while I finish up here but
[1:35:16] it just it just helps get the blood
[1:35:20] flowing so in here is dirt Potter dirt
[1:35:25] okay try and do this can you all see the
[1:35:30] pot somewhat okay this is the outer man
[1:35:35] okay you can't see what's inside of this
[1:35:38] I can't see you look in the mirror every
[1:35:42] day you don't know what you don't know
[1:35:44] you can't see yourself I mean you see
[1:35:46] you see the outer man but you don't see
[1:35:48] the inner man right so but if you take
[1:35:52] this and we in well most a lot of people
[1:35:57] like apples some might not and we're
[1:36:02] gonna examine the heart and maybe the
[1:36:08] apple you know it's got a little
[1:36:10] puncture hole over here it's got it's
[1:36:12] got a little bruise on it it's got it's
[1:36:15] got some spots where it might have
[1:36:16] fallen maybe they picked it up off the
[1:36:18] ground it was dirty and they washed it
[1:36:22] okay it's the outer part but in this
[1:36:28] Apple I can get it here
[1:36:35] in this Apple is a seed in this seed is
[1:36:41] all the virtues of the perfect man I
[1:36:46] mean in this seed is all the apples that
[1:36:51] will ever be produced by this scene now
[1:36:56] I'm gonna plant the seat in this dirt
[1:37:00] okay so I just put it into an atmosphere
[1:37:06] and I'm gonna bring a little water of
[1:37:09] the Spirit on it and now it's 1237 I
[1:37:18] don't know how long you guys usually go
[1:37:19] to but we're all gonna sit down until
[1:37:24] this starts growing we all know that we
[1:37:33] will never leave probably not even next
[1:37:37] year we'll still be sitting here waiting
[1:37:39] for this thing to grow this is a growth
[1:37:43] and this is what I want I want to bring
[1:37:46] this point out first of all in this seed
[1:37:49] is all the virtues of the perfect man
[1:37:53] the second thing you need to realize is
[1:37:56] that it is a growth and it's a process
[1:38:00] you would think I would was completely
[1:38:04] insane if I was serious and said let's
[1:38:06] wait until this grows because we know
[1:38:08] that it's a process it's a process why
[1:38:11] is it important to come to church
[1:38:13] because there's an atmosphere it's for
[1:38:16] your benefit why it's it takes an
[1:38:19] atmosphere on this seat it takes it
[1:38:22] takes the light of the word on the seat
[1:38:25] it takes being in the atmosphere of the
[1:38:27] Holy Spirit raining down on it to get to
[1:38:29] bring the life that's inside of it out
[1:38:32] so be encouraged stand still
[1:38:37] get in the atmosphere get quiet before
[1:38:41] the Lord and grow
[1:38:44] you might not see it we don't see this
[1:38:47] growing but maybe in a few days that
[1:38:50] seed would start to rot the outside and
[1:38:53] it would start to it would start to
[1:38:55] change its the transforming by the
[1:38:57] renewing of your mind you say man ah
[1:39:00] quit talking here
[1:39:06] can we just bow our bow our heads here a
[1:39:09] moment
[1:39:18] and maybe
[1:39:24] maybe here this morning maybe you see
[1:39:31] the promises of God you know you you
[1:39:35] heard this morning that there's a
[1:39:37] stature there's a life that God's
[1:39:39] looking for and maybe you feel far away
[1:39:43] from it maybe the devil comes up and he
[1:39:47] says you know what that's not for you
[1:39:50] you'll never obtain it I want to come
[1:39:54] together in prayer and ask that the Lord
[1:40:00] would help you to see past that all's we
[1:40:05] can do is believe there's nothing more
[1:40:10] with it
[1:40:13] it takes Christ so don't look at the
[1:40:18] outer man look to the look to your heart
[1:40:23] this morning
[1:40:24] that there's a desire to become the
[1:40:27] stature of Christ just hold that in your
[1:40:32] heart as we pray our dear Jesus I come
[1:40:36] before you Lord and father so many times
[1:40:42] Lord I wonder God after preaching your
[1:40:46] word Lord if I got out of the way and I
[1:40:52] wonder Lord if I just hope and pray
[1:40:55] father that I did and that your bride
[1:41:00] here was edified this morning Lord
[1:41:07] sometimes when we hear these things we
[1:41:08] can feel so far from the mark especially
[1:41:11] if we made a mistake during the week but
[1:41:15] father under the sound of my voice now
[1:41:19] God I just we want to bring those things
[1:41:21] before your throne
[1:41:24] if we made a mistake God we confess it
[1:41:27] now father and we pray Lord for your
[1:41:31] forgiveness if we fed on something wrong
[1:41:36] Lord during the week and it didn't edify
[1:41:40] us Lord but it opened the door for the
[1:41:43] enemy to come in forgive us father Lord
[1:41:47] our hearts aren't to do those things but
[1:41:49] Paul said that he finds that there's two
[1:41:52] laws working in him this is the law of
[1:41:56] sin where he does the things that he
[1:42:00] doesn't he doesn't want to do and he
[1:42:03] doesn't do the things that he wants to
[1:42:05] but there's another law and that's the
[1:42:08] law of the Spirit of Christ and by that
[1:42:13] law we can overcome
[1:42:16] father I pray God help us to overcome
[1:42:19] today Lord let your sheep have been fed
[1:42:24] let them see God that they just need to
[1:42:28] sit sit still be still keep coming the
[1:42:35] church keep supporting their pastor
[1:42:41] supporting one another Lord Father I
[1:42:46] pray that a unity would be amongst this
[1:42:48] congregation Lord like no other
[1:42:52] pretty father that if any visitors would
[1:42:55] come that they would see Christ that
[1:42:59] that power of Christ and overcoming
[1:43:03] lives lord help your sheep today my
[1:43:10] heart Lord is that they would be edified
[1:43:13] they would be encouraged
[1:43:17] that if they were corrected they would
[1:43:18] take the correction and that you would
[1:43:22] help them change Lord because we can't
[1:43:23] do it in ourselves give us power to
[1:43:27] change to control our tongues Lord we
[1:43:32] ask these things now be with each one
[1:43:35] Lord be with me with brother Sam Lord
[1:43:39] and this other brother overseas God
[1:43:41] bring them back safely and Lord protect
[1:43:45] their families here a home Satan attacks
[1:43:48] the hardest when when they go and I just
[1:43:52] pray a hedge of fire around him in the
[1:43:55] name of Jesus Christ
[1:43:57] water your seed now in Jesus name
