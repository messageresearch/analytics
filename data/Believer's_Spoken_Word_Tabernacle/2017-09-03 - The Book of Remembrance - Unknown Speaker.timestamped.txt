[39:28] praise the Lord let's just bow our heads
[39:31] and a word of Prayer before we go to
[39:32] scripture this morning
[39:33] Heavenly Father Lord we approach you
[39:37] reverently Lord God as we stand behind
[39:39] this sacred desk they're gone and father
[39:43] we realized the responsibility Lord the
[39:45] lays upon our strollers or but I asked
[39:49] Lord that you help me to yield to you
[39:51] that you may be able to come and speak
[39:54] or to be an encouragement to the people
[39:56] dear God Lord made me renew ourselves
[39:58] today dear God I pray father for your
[40:02] guidance more than I pray Lord for every
[40:05] heart that's here this morning dear God
[40:08] that you will speak to them and help
[40:10] them I pray in Jesus Christ's name Amen
[40:15] and I want to read this morning from the
[40:18] book of Malachi chapter 3 I want to read
[40:23] verses 16 through 18
[40:39] amen
[40:45] then they that feared the Lord speak
[40:49] often one to another and the Lord
[40:51] hearkened and heard it and a book of
[40:55] remembrance was written before him for
[40:57] them that feared the Lord and that
[40:59] thought upon his name and they shall be
[41:03] mine saith the Lord of hosts in that day
[41:06] when I make up my jewels and I will
[41:10] spare them as a man spareth his own son
[41:13] that serveth him then shall ye return
[41:17] and discern between the righteous and
[41:20] the wicked between him that serveth God
[41:24] and him that serveth him not a man you
[41:27] may be seated I want to speak on this
[41:35] morning as book of remember book of
[41:40] remembrance it says here that those that
[41:46] feared the Lord spake often one to
[41:49] another and God hearkened and heard it
[41:54] and wrote it down in the book of
[41:56] remembrance God remembers what you say
[42:01] about him God remembers what you think
[42:06] about him it says
[42:15] for them that feared the Lord and
[42:17] thought upon his name
[42:19] those who think upon his name realize
[42:23] the power that we have in the name of
[42:27] Jesus that in that name anything we
[42:33] asked in that name God hears them
[42:38] there's power in his name and during
[42:44] this time that Malachi is writing here
[42:47] was a very sinful time in Israel and the
[42:55] priests had forsaken their duties and
[43:00] the the majority of Israel had went in
[43:07] the ways of sin and adultery and that in
[43:13] but there were some that stood faithful
[43:17] and stood true and they feared the Lord
[43:21] the Bible says and they and they spoke
[43:24] often one to another about him it's good
[43:28] to testify about the Lord and the things
[43:31] that he's done it's good to bring that
[43:35] to our remember for us too and also to
[43:38] bring it to the remembrance of others
[43:40] that our God is a good dog he's good all
[43:44] the time
[43:45] even in the hardest trials he's still
[43:49] good even in the worst seems of times of
[43:53] our lives God is still there he's still
[43:58] good he's the one that's able the only
[44:01] one capable of delivering us and our
[44:05] times of lead it's good to testify and
[44:09] God writes this down in a book of
[44:13] remembrance
[44:14] there's many books or spoke up that are
[44:17] going to be open at the judgement
[44:18] throughout the Bible these different
[44:21] books are spoke of David even speaks of
[44:23] a book of tears but there's different
[44:26] books there's a book of life and the
[44:30] Bible tells us there's a book that will
[44:32] be open that will in the days of
[44:36] judgment that will people will be judged
[44:40] according to their works by what is
[44:43] written but this is a book of
[44:45] remembrance that the Lord writes so that
[44:49] he has a book that remembers your praise
[44:55] to him remembers your conversation of
[45:00] him remembers your thoughts how that you
[45:05] when you're alone would take time to
[45:09] meditate upon the Lord
[45:10] that's wrote down and he remembers it I
[45:17] want to turn to first Corinthians
[45:21] chapter four and I want to read verses
[45:25] 14 through 17 and I want to look at
[45:30] something about remembering
[45:41] first corinthians chapter 4 verse 14 i
[45:44] write not these things to shame you but
[45:48] as my beloved sons I've warned you were
[45:52] though ye have ten thousand instructors
[45:54] in Christ yet have you not many fathers
[45:58] for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you
[46:01] through the gospel wherefore I beseech
[46:04] you to be followers of me I I can't help
[46:10] when I read that verse in this church
[46:16] but to think of brother brownie he
[46:22] fathered us into the gospel
[46:32] wherefore I beseech you be followers of
[46:35] me for this calls have I sent unto you
[46:38] timotheus who is my beloved son and
[46:42] faithful in the Lord who shall bring you
[46:45] into remembrance of my ways which be in
[46:49] Christ as I teach everywhere in every
[46:52] church now he didn't say that Timothy
[46:56] was going to bring them and remembrance
[46:58] of his of his words but of his way the
[47:08] way he handled the situations that how
[47:14] he dealt with people how he dealt with
[47:17] the churches in certain situations as we
[47:23] go to putting quotes together of this
[47:25] message with the scriptures it's very
[47:29] important to remember the character of
[47:33] the man that brought the message and
[47:38] that's what Paul is speaking of here
[47:40] that Timothy is not just going to bring
[47:43] them into remembrance of what Paul said
[47:46] but he was going to bring them into
[47:48] remembrance of the character of the man
[47:51] who spoke Paul said I've said Timothy
[48:00] not just to quote the message say what
[48:02] he said but to point to the character
[48:06] behind the life the character of the
[48:09] life behind the quote turns me to 1st
[48:16] Thessalonians chapter 2
[48:21] verse nine first this only is chapter
[48:25] two verse nine
[48:34] for ye remember brethren our labour and
[48:37] travail for labouring night and day
[48:40] because we would not be chargeable unto
[48:44] any of you we preached unto you the
[48:47] gospel of God Paul was reminding them of
[48:52] the vocation which he done among them he
[48:57] said I want to let you know I didn't do
[49:00] it for money I didn't do it for
[49:03] popularity and I was not there to bring
[49:07] a weight on you these are important to
[49:12] not only remember what the man preached
[49:14] but the way in which he preached it
[49:26] turn over to the third chapter of first
[49:28] Thessalonians 3rd chapter 6 verse
[49:49] but now when timotheus come came from
[49:54] you unto us and brought us good tidings
[49:57] of your faith and charity and that he
[50:00] had good remembrance of us always
[50:02] desiring greatly to see us as we also to
[50:06] see you Paul didn't say I'm happy to
[50:10] hear that you're quoting what I wrote it
[50:15] was it's important to say what Paul said
[50:17] it was to the people then it is today
[50:21] remember from brother Branham went
[50:24] beyond the curtain of time and they told
[50:26] him said you'll be judged first and then
[50:29] if you're accepted which you will be
[50:32] then your people will also be accepted
[50:35] and brother Branham asked the angel said
[50:37] will Paul have to stand that way and he
[50:40] said yes he would he said well praise
[50:42] God I I said what Paul said so it is
[50:48] important what Paul wanted the people to
[50:52] also remember he wanted them to remember
[50:54] him not just a message but remember him
[51:00] because the man and his message are one
[51:08] when you sever the message from the
[51:11] character that God brought it in through
[51:13] the man you've missed the message what
[51:16] is what was the message
[51:18] it was Christ and when you sever the man
[51:24] from his message you've missed it
[51:26] you've missed the message which was
[51:28] priced the message of our time is
[51:32] becoming be so different sometimes
[51:36] through the people becoming different
[51:39] than the character in which it was
[51:40] delivered we need to remember what kind
[51:45] of man brother Branham was we need to
[51:50] remember that the prophets life was a
[51:54] reflection of the character of the
[51:57] message
[52:01] message is more than just books and
[52:04] paints and quotes it's a life and that
[52:11] life has been projected to us to have
[52:19] the letter but not the spirit and
[52:22] character is death this message must be
[52:29] more to us than just saying what he said
[52:31] must be more than books tapes and quotes
[52:33] it must become our life not the life and
[52:39] character of a man
[52:41] meaning not imitating brother branham
[52:45] but the character of the message which
[52:49] is Christ living in you I have a quote
[52:57] here I want to read from the resume of
[53:00] the ages church age book and I want you
[53:03] to in this to receive what kind of a man
[53:08] it was that brought us this message and
[53:13] I want you to see he's not one to
[53:15] desired great wealth or great
[53:17] accomplishments or achievements but he
[53:22] desired to be a help to the people he
[53:27] says here not for one moment do I bring
[53:29] a message to people that they may follow
[53:32] me or join my church or start some
[53:35] fellowship or organization I've never
[53:39] done that and will not do that now I
[53:42] have no intention in those things but I
[53:46] do have interest in the things of God in
[53:48] people and if I can accomplish this one
[53:51] thing I'll be satisfied that one thing
[53:54] is to see established a true spiritual
[53:58] relationship between God and men wherein
[54:02] men become new creep creations in Christ
[54:06] filled with his spirit and live
[54:08] according to his word
[54:12] now there may be some of you here this
[54:15] morning that are like me you grew up on
[54:21] the coast maybe some of you though have
[54:27] been here and you can say well it's I've
[54:29] been in this message for years but are
[54:38] we remembering the spirit in which the
[54:41] message came
[54:48] turns me to the first Timothy chapter 4
[54:51] I want to read verses 1 through 6
[55:26] now the spirit speaketh expressively in
[55:29] the latter times some shall depart from
[55:32] the faith giving heed to seducing
[55:34] spirits and doctrines of devils speaking
[55:39] lies in hypocrisy having their
[55:41] conscience seared with a hot iron
[55:43] forbidding to marry and commanding to
[55:47] abstain from meats which God hath
[55:49] created to be received with Thanksgiving
[55:50] of them which believe and know the truth
[55:54] for every creature of God is good and
[55:57] nothing to be refused if it be received
[56:00] with Thanksgiving for it is sanctified
[56:03] by the Word of God and prayer if thou
[56:07] put the Brethren in remembrance of these
[56:09] things thou shalt be a good minister of
[56:12] Jesus Christ nourished up in the words
[56:15] of faith and of good doctrine whereunto
[56:18] thou past attained he's telling Timothy
[56:24] stir up their memories
[56:26] stir it up back to the faith stir it not
[56:31] to the law and the works and deeds of
[56:35] the law but stir it up to the grace of
[56:38] God stir it up that they that they
[56:42] remember always giving Thanksgiving unto
[56:45] God for all things in which they
[56:48] received stirring up their memories to
[56:51] the message that was bribe now to her to
[56:59] me to 2nd Timothy chapter 1 verse 2
[57:04] through 6 2 Timothy my dearly beloved
[57:10] son grace mercy and peace from God the
[57:13] Father and Christ Jesus our Lord
[57:16] I thank God whom I serve from my
[57:20] forefathers with the pure conscience
[57:22] that without ceasing
[57:23] I have remembrance of thee in my prayers
[57:27] night and day greatly desiring to see
[57:30] thee being mindful of thy tears that I
[57:34] may be filled with joy when I call to
[57:37] remembrance the unfeigned
[57:39] faith that wood is in thee with dwelt
[57:42] first in thy mother grandmother Lois and
[57:46] thy mother Eunice and I am persuaded
[57:49] that in thee also wherefore I put the in
[57:53] remembrance that thou stir up the gift
[57:55] of God which is in thee by the putting
[57:57] on of my hands he's telling Timothy you
[58:03] need to be reminded of the vision of
[58:06] this messy
[58:08] he's tell him you need to be reminded of
[58:11] arc of your call and of your purpose we
[58:16] need to be reminded we all have a
[58:19] purpose they say I don't know what my
[58:24] purpose is to serve God to testify of
[58:30] his name to spread the good news you
[58:35] don't you don't have to have any special
[58:39] qualifications to spread the good news
[58:43] when Jesus appeared unto the woman at
[58:49] the tomb and said go tell my disciples
[58:54] she didn't have any special
[58:57] qualifications or special talents but
[59:04] she was instructed to go tell my
[59:06] disciples and Peter that I have arisen
[59:15] amen
[59:17] were to all give testimony that he is
[59:20] alive today that he lives within our
[59:23] hearts and that his works are it's not
[59:27] just us remembering things of the
[59:31] Scriptures but remembering things that
[59:34] has happened in our own lives
[59:36] remembering the faith that we had at the
[59:40] beginning remembering the faith in which
[59:43] we started out with I am
[59:49] going to call to your remembrance some
[59:52] of you something very simple showing of
[59:56] faith one time there was two sisters
[1:00:00] from this church they were working in
[1:00:04] the kitchen the camp-meeting
[1:00:06] in Michigan and they dropped the stem
[1:00:11] from the coffee pot down in the pipe and
[1:00:17] didn't know how to get it back and one
[1:00:21] of them said well I read in the Bible
[1:00:23] where God had an axe head to float when
[1:00:29] the Prophet stuck his stick in the water
[1:00:31] let's just lay hands on this pipe and
[1:00:34] pray God would have that stem to float
[1:00:35] up to the top I'm sure you know what
[1:00:40] happened that stem of that that car got
[1:00:44] floated up to the top of that pipe and
[1:00:46] they pulled it out that's just simple
[1:00:49] faith taking God at His Word if God
[1:00:53] could do it then he's the same yesterday
[1:00:56] today and forever
[1:00:59] he can do it now if he touched the life
[1:01:03] back then and changed it he can change
[1:01:06] the life today if he healed someone from
[1:01:13] a sickness in the past he's capable of
[1:01:16] healing them if you'll only believe
[1:01:19] today he was reminding Timothy we're not
[1:01:30] here to have a big church or big numbers
[1:01:35] he said we're here to bring the message
[1:01:40] of Christ to the people we're not here
[1:01:46] to impress people with our ministry
[1:01:49] we're here to help the bride get ready
[1:01:52] to go into rapture
[1:01:55] we're not here to argue debate and fuss
[1:01:59] over quotes were here to produce Christ
[1:02:04] [Music]
[1:02:07] old God remind us of what you called us
[1:02:11] to remind us amen of why you sent the
[1:02:19] message and why you opened our eyes to
[1:02:21] it remind us that we were in a age that
[1:02:28] was wretched poor and blind remind us
[1:02:33] you didn't have to open her eyes the
[1:02:36] song says you could have easily passed
[1:02:38] us by for the age we were living in was
[1:02:41] rich and poor and blind oh but then we
[1:02:46] heard recognizing your day oh yeah God
[1:02:55] opened our eyes not to a man but to
[1:03:03] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:03:06] and forever and the thing that we must
[1:03:12] see in the man who brought the message
[1:03:14] is that he had the character of Jesus
[1:03:17] Christ
[1:03:20] that's the same character we're to have
[1:03:23] I want to be like Jesus as song says
[1:03:32] amen
[1:03:39] hooking second Timothy chapter 2 verse
[1:03:46] 13 through 15
[1:04:01] listen carefully to this if we believe
[1:04:06] not yet he abideth faithful he cannot
[1:04:11] deny himself of these things put them in
[1:04:18] remembrance charging them before the
[1:04:21] Lord that they strive not about words to
[1:04:25] no profit but to the subverting of the
[1:04:28] hearers study to show thyself approved
[1:04:31] unto God a workman that needeth not to
[1:04:34] be ashamed rightly dividing the word of
[1:04:36] truth Paul is reminding Timothy people
[1:04:44] will sometimes fall short sometimes
[1:04:49] they'll make mistakes but they are the
[1:04:56] people of God those that are sealed with
[1:05:01] the Holy Ghost though they make mistakes
[1:05:04] God cannot deny himself for it's himself
[1:05:10] that is in you hallelujah
[1:05:16] and he says put the people in
[1:05:20] remembrance of the word put them in
[1:05:23] remembrance what that if any man sin we
[1:05:27] have an advocate with the father amen
[1:05:33] remind them that their security is not
[1:05:35] within themselves hallelujah it's not
[1:05:41] security within our own righteousness
[1:05:44] for our righteousness the Bible says as
[1:05:47] filthy rags but that our security is in
[1:05:51] Christ who was the worthy one who was
[1:05:55] slain for our sins for all the sins of
[1:05:59] the world
[1:06:03] remaining it's not their works
[1:06:10] but it is the grace of Almighty God
[1:06:22] let's look in first Corinthians chapter
[1:06:24] 16
[1:06:51] verse 10
[1:06:59] now timotheus come see that he may be
[1:07:03] with you without fear for he worketh the
[1:07:09] work of the Lord
[1:07:10] as I also do he's telling the church
[1:07:16] here in Corinth you can trust Timothy he
[1:07:21] work at the same work as I do he'll
[1:07:24] carry on the work in like character he
[1:07:31] didn't say they were exactly like in
[1:07:33] flesh but he's saying that the character
[1:07:38] of the working of the work of the Lord
[1:07:42] is the same they can receive Timothy
[1:07:50] without fear they can know that the same
[1:07:56] God that was working through Paul was
[1:07:58] working through Timothy amen the same
[1:08:03] Holy Ghost that was leading the one was
[1:08:07] leading the other as well that this
[1:08:12] Minister this pastor Timothy was
[1:08:17] following in the character of the
[1:08:21] messenger olympians chapter 2
[1:08:34] verse 19 through 22
[1:08:45] but I trust in the Lord Jesus to send
[1:08:49] timotheus shortly unto you that I also
[1:08:53] may be of good comfort when I know your
[1:08:55] state for I have no man like-minded who
[1:09:00] will naturally care for your state for
[1:09:04] all seek their own not the things which
[1:09:07] are Jesus Christ but you know the proof
[1:09:10] of him that as a son with the father he
[1:09:14] hath served me in the gospel it was not
[1:09:20] that Timothy would have to report back
[1:09:22] to Paul the state of the church but Paul
[1:09:25] had confidence in Timothy knowing how
[1:09:29] Timothy would conduct himself and how
[1:09:32] Timothy would can would react and how
[1:09:35] Timothy the character of the Christ that
[1:09:39] Timothy had he knew that once Timothy
[1:09:41] got there no matter what had been going
[1:09:44] on no matter what state they previous
[1:09:46] had been in that they would come into a
[1:09:49] state of peace that he would lead and
[1:09:53] guide them and bring them into a well
[1:09:55] state
[1:10:05] turn me to Hebrews chapter 13 I want to
[1:10:13] read verses 7 and 8 I believe
[1:10:48] remember them that have the rule over
[1:10:50] you who have spoken unto you the Word of
[1:10:54] God whose faith follow considering the
[1:10:58] end of their conversation Jesus Christ
[1:11:02] the same yesterday and today and forever
[1:11:07] he was reminding the church remember
[1:11:11] them to have the rule over you now that
[1:11:14] rule over you doesn't mean ruling as a
[1:11:16] king or ruling us some monarch but that
[1:11:23] the administration of Christ's headship
[1:11:27] was coming through that vessel and he's
[1:11:32] saying you can follow their faith
[1:11:37] because you can consider the end of
[1:11:40] their conversation you can consider
[1:11:43] their character their life and you can
[1:11:53] consider if they went on before us where
[1:11:55] they went
[1:11:56] I don't want to go there too so follow
[1:12:05] in the faith consider the conversation
[1:12:08] what was their conversation that Jesus
[1:12:11] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:12:13] forever now let's look in Philippians
[1:12:17] chapter 1
[1:12:25] Philippians chapter 1 I want to begin
[1:12:28] reading verse 1 really exclusively down
[1:12:31] through verse 11 Paul and timotheus the
[1:12:38] servants of Jesus Christ to all the
[1:12:41] saints in Christ Jesus which are in
[1:12:44] Philippi with the bishops and deacons
[1:12:47] grace be unto you and peace from God our
[1:12:51] Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ I
[1:12:54] thank my god upon every remembrance of
[1:12:58] you always in every prayer of mine for
[1:13:01] you all making requests with joy for
[1:13:05] your fellowship in the gospel from the
[1:13:08] first day until now being confident of
[1:13:11] this very thing that he which hath begun
[1:13:14] a good work in you will perform it until
[1:13:16] the day of Jesus Christ even as it is
[1:13:21] meat for me to think this of you all
[1:13:24] because I have you in my heart in so
[1:13:28] much as both in my bonds and in the
[1:13:33] deference and confirmation of the gospel
[1:13:36] ye all are in partakers of my grace for
[1:13:45] God is my record how greatly I longed
[1:13:49] after you all in the bowels of Jesus
[1:13:53] Christ and this I pray that your love
[1:13:56] may abound yet more and more in
[1:13:59] knowledge and in all judgment that ye
[1:14:02] may approve things that are excellent
[1:14:05] that you may be sincere without offence
[1:14:09] until the day of Christ being filled
[1:14:11] with the fruits of righteousness which
[1:14:13] are by Jesus Christ unto the glory and
[1:14:16] praise of God I'm sorry I mispronounced
[1:14:22] the word there it should be in defense
[1:14:24] and confirmation of the gospel
[1:14:31] Paul was telling them I am in
[1:14:40] remembrance of you and here you can
[1:14:46] trust assure that he instructed Timothy
[1:14:49] to be in remembrance of the people
[1:14:53] remember the work of God in their lives
[1:14:57] remember that that he that's begun the
[1:15:00] good work is able to perform it until
[1:15:03] the day of Jesus Christ he's able to
[1:15:06] bring it
[1:15:06] he doesn't just start the work in US but
[1:15:08] he's gonna bring it to perfection he's
[1:15:16] telling them these churches are already
[1:15:18] they were already established they lay
[1:15:20] claim to Paul as their father in the
[1:15:22] gospel but Timothy still had to remind
[1:15:27] them of the faith and of the word that
[1:15:30] had been delivered by the messenger but
[1:15:34] I like that Paul says I am I think my
[1:15:40] god every members of you and that I
[1:15:43] think of you all because you are in my
[1:15:46] heart
[1:15:50] ministry such as this ministry that not
[1:15:57] only the ministry that you have here now
[1:15:59] currently but the ministry which
[1:16:02] established this church had you in their
[1:16:06] heart I know that brother browning when
[1:16:13] he began to see the different ones that
[1:16:15] had come in under his ministry coming
[1:16:19] back to serve God and did rededicate
[1:16:23] their lives to God it brought joy joy
[1:16:25] why because you were always in his heart
[1:16:34] paster never forgets
[1:16:37] anyone that his ministry has died they
[1:16:42] stay in his heart - a manner of which
[1:16:46] constantly prays for his people he prays
[1:16:52] knowing the struggles that you have God
[1:17:00] has made the pastor in such a way that
[1:17:03] the pastor can see beyond what just we
[1:17:11] present and see what we really are
[1:17:14] discernment of the word and when he sees
[1:17:21] us struggling he don't condemn us but he
[1:17:26] takes our names before God in prayer
[1:17:39] part of me heard me the second Peter
[1:17:42] chapter one
[1:18:12] now in this chapter Peter is speaking
[1:18:19] here about our walk of faith that we
[1:18:27] have been given exceedingly great and
[1:18:33] precious promises that we might be
[1:18:38] partakers of the divine nature and he
[1:18:42] reminds the people give all diligence
[1:18:45] verse five and besides this give all
[1:18:51] diligence add to your faith virtue and
[1:18:55] to your virtual knowledge and to
[1:18:59] knowledge temperance and to temperance
[1:19:01] patience and to patience godliness and
[1:19:05] to godliness brotherly kindness and to
[1:19:08] brotherly kindness charity that's love
[1:19:12] for if these things be in you and abound
[1:19:16] they make you that ye shall neither be
[1:19:19] barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge
[1:19:23] of our Lord Jesus Christ but he the lack
[1:19:28] of these things is blind and cannot see
[1:19:30] afar off and hath forgotten that he was
[1:19:34] purged from his old sins wherefore the
[1:19:39] rather brethren give diligence to make
[1:19:42] your calling and election sure for if
[1:19:45] you do these things you shall not fail
[1:19:47] for so an entrance shall be ministered
[1:19:51] unto you abundantly into the everlasting
[1:19:53] kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:19:56] Christ wherefore I will not be negligent
[1:20:00] to put you always in remembrance of
[1:20:03] these things though you know them and be
[1:20:06] established in the present truth Peter
[1:20:11] saying though you know these things that
[1:20:14] you're establishing the present truth
[1:20:17] that perhaps you know the quotes just as
[1:20:22] well as I do
[1:20:25] you read your Bible and the Spirit comes
[1:20:31] upon you when you read your Bible and
[1:20:33] quickens that word to you even though
[1:20:37] you know I'm still gonna put you in
[1:20:41] remembrance of these things to always
[1:20:44] keep them before you we should never we
[1:20:55] come to hear someone preach I've set and
[1:20:58] I've heard preachers begin to preach and
[1:21:01] of course I know what they're preaching
[1:21:03] I already know it I already understand
[1:21:06] it but I don't sit there and say well I
[1:21:07] know this I know that I'm not one of
[1:21:12] those that meets the preacher in the
[1:21:14] back and tells him what he left out and
[1:21:16] what he should have said
[1:21:25] but I I sit there and say god there's
[1:21:27] something else that you're gonna show me
[1:21:30] today from this I'm gonna see something
[1:21:33] else I'm gonna be encouraged you know
[1:21:40] there are times when I get discouraged I
[1:21:43] get down as a person and my wife
[1:21:48] encourages me and you know what she
[1:21:52] encourages me with the word that well
[1:21:56] you know the word yes I do there's times
[1:21:59] I need to be putting remembrance of it
[1:22:01] there's times you need to be putting
[1:22:04] remembrance of it when you're going
[1:22:05] through something and needed leverage
[1:22:08] you need to be put in remembrance that
[1:22:10] he is a deliverer sometimes you need to
[1:22:14] be putting remembrance of the arrow of
[1:22:16] deliverance not just striking three
[1:22:20] times but strike that bang until you
[1:22:23] free Alleluia even though we know it's
[1:22:37] good to be putting remember say I've
[1:22:43] heard the message of the rapture it's
[1:22:45] still good to preach about the rapture
[1:22:48] hallelujah it's encouraging look we we
[1:22:54] have enough voices out in the world that
[1:22:58] we that we have to hear and there's
[1:23:02] always a voice of our enemy sometimes
[1:23:05] speaking over our shoulder trying to
[1:23:08] discourage us one time I was on a Sunday
[1:23:17] morning someone came in and came to me
[1:23:24] and where I was studying and said about
[1:23:27] remember their brother who hadn't been
[1:23:28] coming to church and it just struck me
[1:23:32] and so I made a phone call
[1:23:37] to that particular individual that
[1:23:40] Sunday morning and I said you've been
[1:23:45] listening to the devil all this time
[1:23:47] that's why you're out of church it's
[1:23:50] about time now you recognize this is the
[1:23:53] voice of God telling you to get up get
[1:23:54] ready and go to church
[1:24:00] [Applause]
[1:24:02] he got up got ready in Cambridge Church
[1:24:04] I wouldn't say you do that as a practice
[1:24:08] I just felt led of God to do that when
[1:24:10] you felt led of God to do something
[1:24:11] don't matter how strange it might seem
[1:24:13] do it but no it's the Lord leading you
[1:24:23] okay second Corinthians chapter 7 no I'm
[1:24:28] reading a lot of scriptures today
[1:24:29] haven't you turned a lot in your Bible
[1:24:32] it's just the type of message I have
[1:24:34] today
[1:24:47] second corinthians chapter seven verses
[1:24:50] 13 through 15
[1:24:56] therefore we were comforted in your
[1:25:00] comfort
[1:25:01] yeh and exceedingly the more joy we for
[1:25:05] the joy of Titus because his spirit was
[1:25:09] refreshed by you all where I have
[1:25:12] boasted anything to him of you I am not
[1:25:17] ashamed but as we speak all things to
[1:25:20] you in truth even so are boasting which
[1:25:23] I made before Titus is found a truth and
[1:25:28] his inward affection is more abundantly
[1:25:31] toward you whilst he remembereth the
[1:25:34] obedience of you all how was fear and
[1:25:36] trembling he received him paul had
[1:25:41] bragged to titus about this church that
[1:25:44] he was sending him to in in corinth he
[1:25:48] had bragged about it he had bragged
[1:25:50] about how they would react when Titus
[1:25:53] preached to them he bragged about the
[1:25:57] Liberty that Titus would feel in that
[1:26:00] particular assembly he bragged about the
[1:26:04] anointing and spirit and power of God
[1:26:06] that would be there among that assembly
[1:26:10] and he told he more or less was telling
[1:26:14] Titus you're gonna have a wonderful time
[1:26:17] over there preaching to those people
[1:26:21] they all align and identify with the
[1:26:24] word as you speak it you know when the
[1:26:31] word of God comes forth were to want to
[1:26:37] be sensitive to the spirit the word when
[1:26:41] it's coming forward even the times when
[1:26:43] it's been correction we can say ok now
[1:26:46] that was for me I want to be that
[1:26:50] sensitive don't you I don't want to be
[1:26:52] the type that's always saying that's for
[1:26:55] him that was for her that was for them
[1:26:57] over there I come under out of this
[1:27:02] unscathed no but I want to look what is
[1:27:06] God's saying to me
[1:27:08] I want to identify with the word I
[1:27:14] wanted to find myself in what is being
[1:27:18] preached titus goes to preach there and
[1:27:25] guess what the church encourages Titus
[1:27:30] Titus is blessed by the people by their
[1:27:35] reaction to the word and it stirs his
[1:27:39] affection toward the people and he says
[1:27:43] I love to go there and preach you know
[1:27:52] churches are remembered according to how
[1:27:55] they received ministry how they respond
[1:28:00] to the preaching of the word and I'll
[1:28:02] tell you something not only are they
[1:28:05] remembered by the ministers that come
[1:28:08] with those ministers passed on the word
[1:28:12] a the church up there in Ohio is a good
[1:28:17] place to go preach
[1:28:19] you're not having to plow the field all
[1:28:22] by yourself they got some people that
[1:28:27] are a menu they've got some people that
[1:28:29] are there to get into the spirit and you
[1:28:33] know it isn't always how loud or vocal
[1:28:36] you are although I enjoy that but as I
[1:28:40] scan the people as I'm preaching there
[1:28:43] there are times that something and you
[1:28:47] might pull my attention directly do you
[1:28:51] what is it the only thing I can say is
[1:28:54] you pulling on the Lord you pulling on
[1:28:57] that word you've come here to say God
[1:29:00] what did you have for me today there's a
[1:29:07] brother in our church he's visited here
[1:29:10] before he's not very vocal and he's not
[1:29:13] you know real loud or anything but at
[1:29:18] home
[1:29:19] when he gets excited he'll and I know
[1:29:25] he's right there with me so it's it you
[1:29:31] know it's encouraging when the people
[1:29:35] help you preach what we call it I went
[1:29:39] to a church one down one time down in
[1:29:41] Okeechobee Florida and this church
[1:29:50] wonderful group of people and I preached
[1:29:54] and they pulled and I preached and they
[1:29:56] pulled and I preached Napal and after
[1:30:00] the service one of the brothers said we
[1:30:01] took it kind of easy on you tonight we
[1:30:03] didn't want to scare you
[1:30:05] [Laughter]
[1:30:20] first Thessalonians chapter 1 verses 2 &
[1:30:24] 3
[1:30:43] we get thanks to God always for you all
[1:30:45] making mention of you in our prayers
[1:30:48] remembering without ceasing your work of
[1:30:50] faith and labor of love and patience of
[1:30:53] Hope in our Lord Jesus Christ in the
[1:30:56] sight of God and our Father he's talking
[1:31:01] about about this church in Thessalonica
[1:31:05] that he remembered their work of faith
[1:31:11] how that they you would come into the
[1:31:16] service as the Prophet said many times
[1:31:20] there is such a Bank of faith here in
[1:31:23] this place that anything is possible and
[1:31:30] he's talking about their labor of love
[1:31:32] and their patience of Hope Paul
[1:31:37] remembers these things look churches are
[1:31:41] remembered among the ministry I've
[1:31:45] preached in places where I got up to
[1:31:48] preach and after I read the scripture I
[1:31:52] started praying within myself Oh God
[1:31:54] helped me make it through this because
[1:31:58] it was like I was preaching just two
[1:32:01] pews and not that you ever go around
[1:32:06] talking bad about anyone but you never
[1:32:11] meant sometimes you never mentioned
[1:32:13] those churches at all
[1:32:17] but you mentioned the ones that are
[1:32:21] encouraging the ones that are good and
[1:32:25] easy to preach to the ones who have can
[1:32:31] join with you their faith with yours to
[1:32:36] make all things possible in the service
[1:32:45] all right turns me to Hebrews chapter 10
[1:32:48] I want to change gears here a little bit
[1:32:52] looking at my time and it's running now
[1:33:19] verse
[1:33:21] 31
[1:33:28] is a fearful thing to fall into the
[1:33:31] hands of the Living God
[1:33:32] but call to remembrance the former days
[1:33:35] in which after ye were illuminated you
[1:33:39] endured a great fight of afflictions I
[1:33:45] want us now to take and recall in our
[1:33:49] life when we first got saved when God
[1:33:56] first opened our eyes to this truth how
[1:33:59] we felt how charged we were how that we
[1:34:09] couldn't wait to share it with someone
[1:34:11] else and the times when we shared it and
[1:34:16] it was just stopped abruptly that didn't
[1:34:19] discourage us we found someone else to
[1:34:21] share it with
[1:34:23] we were not ashamed of of it we wanted
[1:34:27] to tell people about what God had did in
[1:34:30] our lives the Bible in Revelations talks
[1:34:36] about them to people leaving their first
[1:34:40] love you know I've seen couples and as
[1:34:50] they got older more years of marriage
[1:34:53] that they became common to one another
[1:34:58] then I've seen couples that the more of
[1:35:02] the longer they were married the more in
[1:35:04] love they became and that you know I'm
[1:35:15] thankful that eyes of love looked beyond
[1:35:17] our fault our fleshly human father any
[1:35:25] man and I think then about our walk with
[1:35:29] the Lord
[1:35:30] how that how often do we tell him I love
[1:35:34] you Lord
[1:35:35] is it just a church how often do we
[1:35:39] thank him how often do we do it and what
[1:35:43] do we still feel what we felt that first
[1:35:47] time when he came into our hardest that
[1:35:50] joy kind of lujah sometimes the people
[1:35:58] first come to Christ well too much
[1:36:02] church know they can't get enough they
[1:36:05] can't wait from one service to the next
[1:36:07] to get back would beware of that cooling
[1:36:13] off the time when the doors open and
[1:36:19] you're not there because this or that
[1:36:22] the other came up what should be first
[1:36:28] in our life its Christ amen I understand
[1:36:34] that there are are times legitimately
[1:36:38] but you can't make it but you know
[1:36:41] within your own heart whether it is or
[1:36:43] not so you know what I'm talking about
[1:36:49] the mess of what house will you build me
[1:36:52] says I know that each of one of you if
[1:36:55] you feel like I do I am so hungry to see
[1:36:58] the Spirit of God moving I just can't
[1:37:01] hardly stand it some experiences I just
[1:37:05] had up in the mountain just to feel that
[1:37:07] once again
[1:37:09] that's something that when I was first
[1:37:11] Saved that was so glorious to my heart
[1:37:15] and we can come into a place we can set
[1:37:19] and we can see it among us that we are
[1:37:23] drying as we sit here in the desert
[1:37:27] I get among my brethren they talked to
[1:37:29] me and I talked to them and always in a
[1:37:32] little way of watching filling out their
[1:37:34] with the spirit as it was to see just
[1:37:37] the condition of that brother to see
[1:37:38] what's wrong I begin to feel it's all
[1:37:42] reclining getting away from the spirit
[1:37:45] it's become too
[1:37:48] real thing to us we must worship in the
[1:37:51] spirit where this where the Spirit of
[1:37:53] God is not only our message should be
[1:37:58] the flame of the hour but it should be
[1:38:00] the flame in our hearts it's got to be
[1:38:04] in our hearts or we can't rightly
[1:38:08] present it to the people the spirit has
[1:38:12] to pack the message itself
[1:38:19] remember the tenderness is sweetness we
[1:38:22] had in God you know he hasn't changed
[1:38:29] he's still the same as he was the day
[1:38:34] you got say but sometimes we go through
[1:38:39] defeat we go through battles where we
[1:38:44] feel like we failed we've defeated burn
[1:38:48] me the First Samuel can you give me a
[1:38:50] little more time
[1:38:51] I usually preach real short so you can
[1:38:55] bear with me this morning I'll take up
[1:38:57] some of the time I left off before First
[1:39:01] Samuel Chapter seven
[1:39:19] in verse 11 through 13
[1:39:27] and the men of Israel went out of miss
[1:39:30] book and pursued the Philistines and
[1:39:33] smote them until they came under Beth
[1:39:37] car then Samson took a stone and set it
[1:39:41] between mesma and shin and called the
[1:39:45] name of it evany sir
[1:39:47] the named Ebenezer means a stone of help
[1:39:52] saying here two hath the Lord helped us
[1:39:56] so the Philistines were subdued and they
[1:39:59] came no more into the coasts of Israel
[1:40:02] and the hand of the Lord was against the
[1:40:04] Philistine all the days of Samuel now
[1:40:09] the people of Israel before the days of
[1:40:12] Samuel had suffered some great defeats
[1:40:14] at the hands of the Philistine and they
[1:40:21] had had about twenty years prior to
[1:40:25] Samuel they had had a great battle in
[1:40:28] this same exact place and they had lost
[1:40:32] the Ark of the Covenant to the
[1:40:34] Philistine and so when they came to this
[1:40:41] place what would be in their members
[1:40:43] would be of a defeat but God gave them
[1:40:50] something to remind them of victory in
[1:40:56] the same location Lord I've lost battles
[1:41:02] here before but now in this time of
[1:41:06] victory I'm putting down a stone I'm
[1:41:08] putting down and ebenezer to remind me
[1:41:12] of victory I want to remember the
[1:41:15] victory and Samuel put the stone of
[1:41:22] ebenezer there to remind the people of
[1:41:27] victory that God was still able to bring
[1:41:32] victory to them that it wouldn't just be
[1:41:35] residing in their minds times of defeat
[1:41:38] friends look
[1:41:39] you need to celebrate your victories
[1:41:44] celebrate them with praise celebrate
[1:41:47] them with spreading the news of your
[1:41:50] victories amen
[1:41:53] and not something to just recall from
[1:41:58] years back but something maybe you can
[1:42:04] recall from this morning David said
[1:42:11] restore unto me the joy of my salvation
[1:42:17] getting lost in salvation he just lost
[1:42:20] the joy of it he just wanted the joy of
[1:42:23] it to be restored restarted me the joy
[1:42:26] of when I first got saved
[1:42:29] Amen restore that exuberance I had Amen
[1:42:36] that excitement I had restore that
[1:42:42] feeling that you felt so close to Christ
[1:42:47] but you felt so thankful that you were
[1:42:50] right there realized that he what he had
[1:42:54] delivered you from this life of sin that
[1:43:00] you can look now in your life and see
[1:43:03] that he is forgiven you he's still the
[1:43:06] same cop the God that culture years ago
[1:43:09] he's still the same God to you today and
[1:43:13] he's had mercy on you
[1:43:14] many of these call back why because he
[1:43:19] belong to him he's not gonna let you go
[1:43:23] [Applause]
[1:43:30] it says here than what here in style
[1:43:32] Elijah now with every head bowed and all
[1:43:36] eyes closed this is lady the church
[1:43:39] members would you raise your hand and
[1:43:41] say god remember me put me in the cleft
[1:43:44] speak to me and it's still small voice I
[1:43:47] want to hear a still small voice that
[1:43:50] will anoint me and will send me
[1:43:52] to my post of duty a different person
[1:43:55] just as true as I'm standing here god I
[1:43:58] believe that you're calling your church
[1:44:00] into a cave now to speak to them and
[1:44:04] Lord it doesn't altogether have to be a
[1:44:07] made cave like the Prophet hid in but it
[1:44:11] could be a little cave in our memory it
[1:44:14] could be a cave in our soul where we can
[1:44:17] move back stop and take inventory and
[1:44:20] look around and then listen to see what
[1:44:22] we hear and then take us from here this
[1:44:26] morning this woman lured to the cave and
[1:44:31] made this convention not altogether
[1:44:35] breaking - a great shot in Jubilee but
[1:44:38] made it break also into an experience
[1:44:40] into us of repenting into a revival and
[1:44:44] spirit and men's hearts that revives
[1:44:47] them and brings them back to God again
[1:44:50] and to that sweet humble experience like
[1:44:53] the night that we were saved Lord
[1:45:16] brother Brian
[1:45:23] just bow our head Heavenly Father
[1:45:29] Lord Jesus thank you for your word today
[1:45:36] Lord for bringing to our remembrance
[1:45:39] these things Lord reminding us of the
[1:45:42] character in which this message had been
[1:45:44] delivered to us and then Lord for
[1:45:48] bringing to our remembrance Lord Jesus
[1:45:51] the experience that we had with you Lord
[1:45:57] I asked God
[1:45:58] may Lord that your presence now as it's
[1:46:01] been with us in the singing as it's been
[1:46:03] with us in the preaching may it now Lord
