[43:58] [Music]
[44:00] Lord this is our desire
[44:05] and it's our longing Lord
[44:08] stay Lord in your presence
[44:10] [Music]
[44:13] oh God
[44:17] realize the Lord that it's just not
[44:20] confined to a building
[44:23] but your desire Lord as you expressed
[44:28] that you would desire to walk in a spot
[44:34] to live Lord so completely in our lives
[44:38] just like Isaiah when he went into the
[44:41] temple that day
[44:44] though he was a prophet all along
[44:47] but that day
[44:49] there came a change in his life
[44:52] there came an influence oh God
[44:55] from another Realm
[44:58] the Living God made himself known in
[45:01] that moment
[45:03] Isaiah stood with discouragement
[45:07] he had saw failure before him
[45:10] but God there was something within him
[45:12] and that is part of yourself that he
[45:16] made his way to the temple if there was
[45:18] going to be an answer that would come
[45:19] his way it would have to come from God
[45:22] and you directed him Lord to that place
[45:27] and he saw you in a way
[45:29] they never saw you before
[45:32] it affected his life
[45:34] like never before
[45:38] and it brought forth a confession
[45:41] a repentance
[45:43] whoa is me
[45:46] for I am undone
[45:49] I'm a man of unclean lips
[45:52] but God wants the confession came
[45:56] here came a seraphin one that ministers
[46:00] the lord of the offering
[46:02] a higher order
[46:04] it took not just any coal
[46:08] but alive cold
[46:11] oh God placing it upon the lips
[46:14] of the prophet
[46:18] God you brought a cleansing
[46:20] in his life
[46:22] just a moment in your presence
[46:26] then he could rise with the confidence
[46:28] when the voice would speak
[46:31] who will go for me
[46:34] oh God what a confidence comes a good
[46:37] courage comes from confession
[46:41] cleansing then commissioning
[46:44] oh God that's your order that's your
[46:47] order
[46:49] that's your order to redeem your
[46:52] children that's your order Lord that
[46:54] your word would go forth Lord in our
[46:56] lives we stand here this morning Lord
[47:00] God
[47:01] that full awareness your desire is to
[47:05] walk
[47:06] in US Lord
[47:08] not just to be the presence that we
[47:13] sense here
[47:16] in this moment that we have set aside on
[47:19] a Sunday and on a Thursday
[47:22] your desire is to so live in the midst
[47:26] of our life oh God
[47:28] Amen to shake the uppermost seat in our
[47:31] life to be the sole influence
[47:34] of our life that our life oh God would
[47:37] be the word of God wrapped
[47:40] and made flesh Granite Lord may this
[47:44] once again this morning

[48:58] three years
[49:00] Brothers of Paul if you'd come and
[49:02] Benjamin or Benjamin and Paul whoever
[49:04] wants to go first
[49:06] from the testimonies from the men's mini
[49:07] isn't it just a wonderful presence of
[49:09] the Lord here
[49:11] man I'm just so thankful that he
[49:14] he comes
[49:16] a manner
[49:17] it's just he comes you know and when he
[49:19] comes he comes to move he comes to work
[49:22] he comes to minister to our lives don't
[49:25] you love him all everything every song
[49:28] that's been sung everything is all with
[49:30] the preparation even for these moments
[49:32] right now of what God is going to do
[49:35] you believe God's going to do things
[49:37] here this morning I believe that I
[49:40] believe that amen that's why we've
[49:41] gathered here we're expecting that
[49:44] Brothers if you'll come just briefly
[49:46] here I don't know just take the wireless
[49:48] mic if you don't mind
[49:55] God bless you all uh I just wanted to
[49:57] mention really quick
[49:59] um about the men's meeting it was a real
[50:00] blessing for me um a lot of you know the
[50:03] brothers a lot um I think all of them
[50:10] anyway I think all of them can agree
[50:13] that uh it was a good experience uh
[50:15] really good teaching
[50:16] um
[50:17] but I think sometimes a lot of people
[50:19] maybe can think that you know
[50:22] you know maybe you don't need it or
[50:24] maybe it's not you know if it's like
[50:25] extra outside of like your own home
[50:27] church but sometimes it takes those
[50:29] extra meetings sometimes that can make a
[50:32] difference and there's different
[50:34] perspectives you can get too from
[50:36] different ministers like my brother Tim
[50:38] Dodd was preaching on the infinite
[50:39] there's different there's different
[50:41] angles that he brought out of who God is
[50:44] and when you see it it's like
[50:47] whoa you know because it's the simple
[50:49] stuff because like growing up the
[50:50] message it's always the simple stuff
[50:51] that blows over your head and you you're
[50:53] like oh really like that's how it works
[50:55] though you know but it's amazing I just
[50:57] thank the Lord that he was able to show
[50:59] some things to me in the men's meeting
[51:00] and
[51:02] just help help me my journey things that
[51:04] I'll have with me you know Lord willing
[51:07] for the rest of the way so I just you
[51:09] know I wish you all would show up Amanda
[51:11] the sisters can't but I wish you always
[51:13] I wish those who could would show up you
[51:15] know
[51:16] um it'd be a real blessing for you and
[51:18] uh I just love you all God bless you
[51:25] and uh well I'll tell you what I can
[51:28] agree with Benjamin and many different
[51:30] others that win it just uh was just a
[51:32] real blessing to be there and for myself
[51:35] I was edified by it and I was just I was
[51:39] really blessed and for me I think the
[51:41] whole time I think before I went there I
[51:43] just I was an expectation you know just
[51:46] to hear from God you know just to
[51:49] receive some from the Lord and really
[51:50] that's what we all had that's really
[51:52] what our desire was is that we wanted to
[51:54] hear from the Lord and for me like what
[51:56] he was mentioning there with uh with
[51:59] brother Tim Don when he uh spoke on the
[52:01] infinite God of and it just it's just it
[52:04] was just such a powerful message you
[52:06] know I mean it was just like it was in
[52:08] one of those morning sessions you know
[52:09] it was like sessions that were I mean
[52:11] there was all day I mean Saturday it was
[52:13] like every day you know like the whole
[52:15] day it was just sessions after session
[52:17] but I I just but the amazing thing about
[52:19] it was we weren't tired
[52:21] you know we weren't tired and we were
[52:23] just like cleaning into strong strength
[52:25] and uh it just it was just really good
[52:28] and everything and he uh brother Tim
[52:30] when he was dealing with the infinite
[52:31] God of how that there's being that God
[52:34] is infinite that there's nothing too big
[52:37] for God it was not too small for a guy
[52:39] and that just that spoke to me that
[52:41] spoke to me that he knows you know from
[52:43] our end to our beginning or beginning to
[52:45] our end you know and that he knows he
[52:47] even knows like he even mentioned he
[52:49] gave an example of how that for even a
[52:51] flea that even knows
[52:53] um how like how a fleeve and bats its
[52:55] eye and of course we all know how a
[52:57] small flea is you know a pretty small
[53:00] little guy you know he's able he's able
[53:03] to like you know uh watch him as he pass
[53:05] his eyes and that's how much to think
[53:07] that that God that knows that that
[53:09] Creator cares about you
[53:11] and he wants a relationship with you and
[53:13] that's just oh that's so wonderful it's
[53:15] just so powerful and I just was really
[53:18] blessed and of course you know when
[53:20] you're down south
[53:21] um you know they'll come up with phrases
[53:23] they'll call you buddy and different
[53:25] things I don't know him from Adam you
[53:27] know but I'm like well that's okay I
[53:30] guess I guess I mean whenever you call
[53:32] me buddy or whatever but I guess I'm
[53:34] your buddy today or whatever but anyway
[53:37] it was uh it was just we just had a real
[53:39] good time it's a real good fellowship
[53:41] and uh just really enjoyed the word and
[53:43] and also you know just like to encourage
[53:46] uh just each and every brother to make
[53:48] it down there it's it's definitely worth
[53:50] the trip it's it's it's worth the eight
[53:52] hours for sure I promise you
[53:55] even you know you can sleep all the way
[53:57] if you want that don't matter just don't
[53:59] just don't be sleeping while you're
[54:00] driving
[54:01] anyway uh yeah but it was just all good
[54:04] and I just want to give God glory that
[54:06] Amanda I received something from the
[54:08] Lord that that week and amen so amen God
[54:11] bless you
[54:11] [Applause]
[54:23] I had to write all my stuff down because
[54:25] I can't remember it the young guys yeah
[54:28] my young buddy over here so uh just a
[54:33] little scripture to part of a scripture
[54:34] to start out with is
[54:36] uh the beginning of Proverbs 1 8 says my
[54:39] son hear the instruction of thy father
[54:41] to me uh that's that's what these men's
[54:44] meetings are it's it's not it's not
[54:47] really a men's meeting it's more like
[54:49] the Holy Spirit just pulling you close
[54:51] you know and sitting down right beside
[54:53] you putting his arm around you and and
[54:55] just uh giving you it's like a private
[54:59] interview with him uh in my opinion so
[55:04] um I wanted to you know all the services
[55:06] were so good I just I wanted to get up
[55:08] and give a little sampler like of of
[55:10] each service but uh it'd be like
[55:13] standing at the Grand Canyon you know
[55:15] and like taking a picture and then
[55:16] showing you the picture just it just
[55:19] doesn't do it justice you know but uh
[55:22] uh brother Samuel last year actually
[55:24] spoke on uh being intentional and I saw
[55:28] you know during during these meetings
[55:30] that it was actually the holy spirit
[55:33] that that was actually very direct uh it
[55:35] was very intentionally
[55:37] um during these meetings and brother
[55:39] Berry actually made a couple of
[55:41] statements um
[55:43] he opened the
[55:45] the first service uh right before he
[55:47] opened in prayer
[55:49] he gave these instructions on kind of
[55:52] how to pray for the services and he says
[55:55] this statement said take your need to
[55:58] the Lord and don't pray in general
[56:02] pray specific and ask God for things
[56:05] that are very real in your life
[56:08] and that just echoed I think just kind
[56:10] of from the previous you know just be
[56:12] intentional and I think these men's
[56:13] meetings
[56:14] are a chance to just be very intentional
[56:17] very specific uh with God and
[56:20] each service was unique
[56:23] uh and direct and in its own way and and
[56:27] I honestly think every uh single person
[56:30] in a tendency I mean from the ministers
[56:32] on down to I believe every brother was
[56:35] ministered to uh directly at one point
[56:38] another I I just can't imagine anybody
[56:40] even was able to leave that type of
[56:43] atmosphere without their life being uh
[56:45] untouched
[56:46] the the ministry team is just absolutely
[56:49] phenomenal
[56:51] and uh I I honestly left with a deeper
[56:54] respect how God can take
[56:56] um
[56:57] you know different preachers from all
[56:59] different areas and different age groups
[57:01] even different races different
[57:02] backgrounds and just have them speak
[57:05] something unique but also speak in
[57:08] unison and that just really came out in
[57:11] these meetings and each sermon was
[57:13] powerful to me but
[57:16] kind of in my humble opinion I I feel
[57:18] our pastor just preached an outstanding
[57:21] message to me and uh
[57:24] and it wasn't just because like it was
[57:27] brother Samuel but I watched like the
[57:28] Holy Spirit just take that instrument in
[57:30] his hand and just
[57:32] strike the bow and just played a song or
[57:35] a sermon that was just absolutely
[57:38] beautiful and I in my opinion after the
[57:41] sermon the Holy Spirit was just so real
[57:43] and in the room and just so sweet and
[57:46] soft and uh
[57:48] brother Barry came up again after after
[57:50] that sermon
[57:52] um
[57:53] and we sing a couple of songs but he
[57:55] still was kind of almost at a loss for
[57:57] words just because the presence was at
[57:59] Sweden
[58:00] he ended that service with this
[58:02] statement
[58:04] my he said
[58:06] you just think it can't get any better
[58:09] you think that God can't get any more
[58:11] personal
[58:12] you think God can't get any closer you
[58:15] think God can't dig any deeper and then
[58:19] he does
[58:20] he just knows how he's the great
[58:23] physician
[58:24] so I thought that that statement just
[58:26] kind of encapsulated
[58:28] the men's meetings what it's all about I
[58:31] mean just when you you know you just
[58:34] think that he had already done all he
[58:37] could do and then he just gets a little
[58:39] more personal a little more deeper he
[58:41] just digs a little farther
[58:44] and he just knows how to do that and it
[58:47] just goes back my son hear the
[58:49] instruction of thy fathers so
[58:52] I'd like to to take just the last few
[58:55] moments and actually uh Echo um brother
[58:57] Paul what he said about the expectations
[59:00] and I felt
[59:02] just a great expectation going into the
[59:04] meetings I mean uh brother Steve and I
[59:06] talked about that for weeks ahead the
[59:08] days prior and I'd heard brothers from
[59:11] other assemblies just talking how they
[59:12] just just felt that you know God was
[59:15] going to move in just a a special way uh
[59:18] and just do something very special in
[59:20] the meetings and
[59:22] so that our expectations going into the
[59:25] men's media I think for for many of the
[59:27] brothers were was just at a high even
[59:30] going into the meeting but uh
[59:33] one thing caught my attention almost
[59:35] immediately
[59:37] and there was someone else with the even
[59:39] greater expectations for these meetings
[59:41] than we had and that was the Lord Jesus
[59:43] Christ
[59:45] and brother Samuel kind of alluded it to
[59:47] alluded to it uh
[59:49] I don't know what time he arrived but
[59:51] the Lord God was already in brother
[59:53] Samuel driveway before we even started
[59:55] to gather
[59:58] he ushered us into our vehicles and he
[1:00:00] personally escorted us down to the
[1:00:02] meetings where he guided our fellowship
[1:00:04] all the way down
[1:00:06] in fact I mean I would estimate probably
[1:00:09] at least 75 percent of the things we
[1:00:11] talked about in the car and on the way
[1:00:14] down was brought out in the meetings at
[1:00:16] one point of another I mean so the Lord
[1:00:19] was just ministering you know directly
[1:00:21] to us
[1:00:22] uh just the whole time
[1:00:26] and he brewed it over us on the way home
[1:00:29] kind of kind of like a tidal wave the
[1:00:31] the sermons and such was kind of like
[1:00:33] the waves crashing ashore and then on
[1:00:35] the way home you know he's seen the
[1:00:36] tidal wave how it just keeps going
[1:00:38] Inland and it just keeps flowing and
[1:00:41] flowing and that's that's what it was
[1:00:43] for us on on the right home it was just
[1:00:46] the Holy Spirit uh just brooding over
[1:00:48] our lives and
[1:00:50] and then it just uh
[1:00:52] during the conversation on the way home
[1:00:54] it just
[1:00:55] it just became very real to me that this
[1:00:58] was more than a men's meeting this had
[1:01:00] been a Divine appointment with God
[1:01:03] Almighty there's just nothing less of
[1:01:05] that so if
[1:01:06] the Lord would tarry for for another
[1:01:08] men's meeting
[1:01:10] I would highly encourage all the
[1:01:13] brothers who have the ability to go to
[1:01:15] the men's meeting to go
[1:01:17] and as men just take the chance
[1:01:20] to have a Divine appointment with the
[1:01:23] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:01:25] and have this chance to become be
[1:01:27] intentional and deliberate and specific
[1:01:29] and personal with him
[1:01:32] he'll be delighted to have you and he
[1:01:34] will make you feel welcome
[1:01:37] amen
[1:01:38] God bless you
[1:01:39] [Applause]
[1:02:16] let's go to Zechariah Chapter 4.
[1:02:21] back there
[1:02:22] this morning
[1:02:24] I think there was also a mention about
[1:02:26] the fire put the fire pit Fellowship
[1:02:29] here at uh 5 p.m this evening I just
[1:02:33] certainly looking forward to that
[1:02:36] you read an announcement about that
[1:02:38] video okay
[1:02:40] well chairs firewood
[1:02:53] Zechariah Chapter 4 and verse 1.
[1:02:57] I know we read these scriptures last
[1:02:58] week but we just really hardly didn't
[1:03:01] get
[1:03:02] too far at all and just upon the thought
[1:03:04] of it
[1:03:05] and I I want to speak continue on that
[1:03:09] thought to see where the Lord allow us
[1:03:11] to get to on overcoming opposition
[1:03:15] overcoming opposition
[1:03:18] verse 1 says and the angel that talked
[1:03:21] with me came again and wake me as a man
[1:03:25] that is awakened out of his sleep
[1:03:29] and said unto me
[1:03:31] what seeth thou and I said I have looked
[1:03:34] and behold a Candlestick all of gold
[1:03:37] with a bowl up on the top of it in his
[1:03:40] seven lamps thereon and seven pipes to
[1:03:43] the seven lamps which are upon the top
[1:03:45] thereof
[1:03:47] and two olive trees buy it one up on the
[1:03:51] right side of the bowl the other upon
[1:03:54] the left side thereof now all of this is
[1:03:57] symbol it's there we understand that
[1:04:00] this was in the Tabernacle of in the
[1:04:05] wilderness remember Moses had been
[1:04:07] caught up and Moses caught the vision
[1:04:10] of of the Tabernacle of God and how that
[1:04:14] that was to be prepared on Earth and all
[1:04:16] of this was representative and a type
[1:04:19] the whole Tabernacle of God
[1:04:23] is man
[1:04:25] God's purpose is to dwell in man
[1:04:32] that's where all that's the where the
[1:04:34] whole mystery comes back to is God's
[1:04:37] purpose to dwell fully in man
[1:04:41] so when we see of these symbols as we
[1:04:44] see here
[1:04:45] what Zachariah is the Angel is Awakening
[1:04:49] him to see these things now notice in
[1:04:52] verse 4 and so I answered and I spoke to
[1:04:55] the angel that talked with me saying
[1:04:57] what are these my Lord
[1:05:00] then the angel that talked with me
[1:05:03] answered and said unto me knowest thou
[1:05:06] not what these be and I said no my Lord
[1:05:11] then he answered and spake unto me
[1:05:14] saying this is the word of the Lord unto
[1:05:18] zerubbabel saying not by might nor by
[1:05:23] power but by my spirit saith the Lord of
[1:05:28] hosts so God is clearly declaring
[1:05:34] strength human strength is not enough
[1:05:37] and it is not acceptable unto God
[1:05:42] even
[1:05:43] itself might is another form of strength
[1:05:47] it's not acceptable unto God because it
[1:05:51] can never accomplish the work of God
[1:05:55] so it's not our might it's not our
[1:05:57] strength because the reality is our
[1:05:59] might and our strength it fails
[1:06:03] right this is why we have to have more
[1:06:06] we we take our will and yield our will
[1:06:10] to the will of God because God's will
[1:06:12] will never override our will it's our
[1:06:15] will being surrendered to the will of
[1:06:18] God that's the key to Victory
[1:06:22] yeah so not by might nor by power but by
[1:06:28] my spirit saith the Lord of hosts
[1:06:32] who art thou o great Mountain
[1:06:36] before zerubbabel Thou shalt become a
[1:06:39] plane
[1:06:41] and he shall bring forth The Headstone
[1:06:43] thereof with shoutings crying Grace
[1:06:47] Grace unto it moreover the word of the
[1:06:51] Lord came unto me saying the hands of
[1:06:53] zerubbabel have laid the foundation of
[1:06:55] this house his hands shall also finish
[1:06:58] it and thou shalt know that the Lord of
[1:07:02] hosts hath sent me unto you for who hath
[1:07:05] despised the day of small things for
[1:07:08] they shall rejoice and shall see the
[1:07:11] plummet in the hand of zerubbabel with
[1:07:14] those seven they are the eyes of the
[1:07:17] Lord which run to and fro through the
[1:07:19] whole Earth
[1:07:20] amen may God bless you bless the reading
[1:07:22] of the word as you're being seated
[1:07:26] we certainly can see that
[1:07:29] in the symbols that are laid out here
[1:07:32] before us
[1:07:33] go out when he was expressing in his
[1:07:36] desire is that
[1:07:38] it would it would take
[1:07:40] it would take God's own life
[1:07:43] coming into a man into a woman and God
[1:07:47] through his life God brings a change in
[1:07:51] that life
[1:07:52] where it's it's not the person
[1:07:55] trying to do right and we all have been
[1:07:58] there we can try to do right I've had
[1:08:01] individuals text me and you know
[1:08:04] different things over the time here and
[1:08:06] not not setting here but texting me and
[1:08:08] I'm trying to get this right and I'm
[1:08:10] listening to this podcast and I I have
[1:08:12] to just come right back and just add the
[1:08:14] one thing as I look right right at and I
[1:08:16] say there's good intentions but you're
[1:08:19] trying to get the cart before the horse
[1:08:22] there's nothing you can do outside of
[1:08:25] being born again
[1:08:29] God never intended that it would be you
[1:08:32] or I handling the word you you or I
[1:08:35] could become a pretty good person we
[1:08:37] could live a good moral life we can live
[1:08:39] clean we could live above sin and still
[1:08:42] not be born again
[1:08:46] are you hearing me now
[1:08:48] uh we're this is a reality that it's
[1:08:51] it's God wanting to reveal himself
[1:08:55] in us and through our lives and so when
[1:09:00] we see this it's not by might it's not
[1:09:03] by power it's not by efforts and that is
[1:09:05] within everything in our life even after
[1:09:08] the Holy Spirit has come into our life
[1:09:11] by way of the new birth
[1:09:14] it still is a bringing to a reality
[1:09:17] within us it's not your power it's not
[1:09:21] your might it's our surrender
[1:09:25] yes sir it's his Spirit accomplishing
[1:09:29] his work in our lives
[1:09:32] and that's why that when even Nicodemus
[1:09:35] can come and Nicodemus could say do you
[1:09:37] expect a man how can a man enter into
[1:09:39] his mother's womb because Jesus is
[1:09:41] talking about being born again he wasn't
[1:09:43] talking about another natural birth
[1:09:45] because another natural birth would have
[1:09:47] the same problems
[1:09:50] so there's got to come a birth something
[1:09:52] that is a part or separate different
[1:09:56] from the natural birth and that requires
[1:10:00] the supernatural birth of the Holy
[1:10:03] Spirit
[1:10:04] God's own life see this is why you
[1:10:08] remember the scriptures that we referred
[1:10:10] to last week out of First John chapter
[1:10:12] four beloved try every spirit
[1:10:16] because it says many false prophets
[1:10:19] false preachers have went out into the
[1:10:22] world and he says we try every Spirit
[1:10:25] not just looking at the flesh but we
[1:10:27] tried the spirit because if it denies
[1:10:30] that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh
[1:10:34] it's not of God
[1:10:36] you realize the agnostics only want to
[1:10:39] make it just a man many just want to say
[1:10:41] well you know Jesus was just a man but
[1:10:44] you see what that is it's not the people
[1:10:46] it's spirits that are upon them to try
[1:10:50] to hold them back from a reality because
[1:10:52] if you have it that God has become flesh
[1:10:56] then it means the way has been opened up
[1:11:00] for you and I there's absolutely no
[1:11:02] excuse
[1:11:04] and it begins to bring what an
[1:11:06] accountability a responsibility in other
[1:11:09] words as pilate stood there that day and
[1:11:13] pilate his wife told him don't you have
[1:11:15] anything to do with this just man I had
[1:11:16] a dream don't touch him don't do nothing
[1:11:18] with him and so what did he do he wanted
[1:11:21] to wash his hands of the situation but
[1:11:25] no matter how much he washed his hands
[1:11:28] he could not get the blood off his hands
[1:11:32] he was responsible
[1:11:35] you know where a person that says well
[1:11:37] I'm just not going to make a decision
[1:11:39] you're making a decision
[1:11:41] every day of your life every service
[1:11:43] you're making a decision I'm making a
[1:11:46] decision it's not a choice or we're no
[1:11:49] choice zone no we're making choices
[1:11:51] every service every day
[1:11:55] so when we consider that pilate remember
[1:11:59] throughout his life the man tried he was
[1:12:02] always profusely as as history records
[1:12:05] trying to wash his hands you know why he
[1:12:08] had come face to face with the just one
[1:12:11] he had come face to face with one that
[1:12:15] stood before him and he could see
[1:12:18] through their lives this is a perfect
[1:12:21] and just man
[1:12:24] are you hearing me now
[1:12:26] it's got to be more than just seeing the
[1:12:29] message as perfect and just
[1:12:32] [Applause]
[1:12:34] are you hearing me it's got to be more
[1:12:37] than just that's a good message that's a
[1:12:39] perfect message that's a just message
[1:12:41] but yeah it has to come to a place what
[1:12:45] does this have to do with me
[1:12:53] because it's Jesus on our hands
[1:12:56] you know we think about the
[1:12:58] accountability that you and I will have
[1:13:01] within this hour it's a high
[1:13:02] accountability
[1:13:04] that we will have brother Samuel that
[1:13:06] scares me sometimes we need to be shook
[1:13:07] in our boots
[1:13:09] because we get the spirit of this age is
[1:13:11] such a you know a Syrah Saran just going
[1:13:14] with the flow and you know and don't
[1:13:17] judge me and this is that this is the
[1:13:19] whole Spirit of the age but God's word
[1:13:22] is a judge
[1:13:24] and you know what I'm thankful for that
[1:13:27] because the Bible tells me that when I
[1:13:30] am judged his desire in our life if I
[1:13:33] can accept it in the right way his
[1:13:35] desire is that I would not be condemned
[1:13:37] with the world
[1:13:42] so when we say this
[1:13:45] the scripture in verse 7 says who art
[1:13:48] down I want you to catch this who art
[1:13:52] thou oh great Mountain it's not a what
[1:13:56] it's who right it's a spirit
[1:14:00] it's Satan
[1:14:03] who art thou oh great obstacle or
[1:14:06] opposition
[1:14:09] is not just thoughts it's spirits
[1:14:14] you realize habits are spirits
[1:14:19] I've gotta I could quote it on the
[1:14:21] direct quote on this but you recognize
[1:14:23] habits are spirits
[1:14:26] people driven to to do things and moved
[1:14:30] about things where does that influence
[1:14:32] come from it's a spirit
[1:14:35] that's why a habit is not just let's
[1:14:38] look at the wall and we're going to
[1:14:40] change this around and we're going to do
[1:14:41] this and you know I'm gonna it's habits
[1:14:44] are not broke without anything apart
[1:14:47] from the Holy Spirit
[1:14:51] is that right
[1:14:52] if all of these things that brother
[1:14:54] random covers it whether it's clothing
[1:14:56] whether it's drinking whether it's less
[1:14:58] all of those things as he covers in that
[1:15:00] quote it's all spirits that are habits
[1:15:03] and the only thing that can break that
[1:15:05] is the Holy Spirit
[1:15:08] yeah
[1:15:10] are you hearing me
[1:15:11] it's very real
[1:15:13] demons are very real
[1:15:16] demons are not bad thoughts demons give
[1:15:19] bad thoughts
[1:15:21] the Holy Ghost is not a good thought the
[1:15:24] Holy Ghost is a person
[1:15:28] [Applause]
[1:15:30] who art the whole great Mountain what
[1:15:32] difficulty or obstacle because before or
[1:15:35] in the presence
[1:15:37] observable Thou shalt become a plane
[1:15:41] cerebrumable being a type of Jesus
[1:15:44] Christ
[1:15:46] are you with me
[1:15:47] it's very important for me to lay these
[1:15:50] things in zerubbabel was not just was
[1:15:53] not just an instrument that was being
[1:15:55] used by God there it was the type of
[1:15:58] Jesus Christ and let me go on to say it
[1:16:01] it's a type of Jesus Christ in the body
[1:16:04] of his bride
[1:16:07] [Applause]
[1:16:09] when the word finds its place in our
[1:16:12] life there's not a devil that can stand
[1:16:16] before you
[1:16:18] Hallelujah I don't care what's been in
[1:16:21] your past I don't care what's been in
[1:16:23] your childhood I don't care what injury
[1:16:25] has come your way I don't care what
[1:16:27] wound I'm not making light of it I'm
[1:16:29] saying that when the word is come in its
[1:16:32] rightful place and if it's there it's to
[1:16:35] recognize when I bring that to the word
[1:16:41] when I bring it to the word bring my
[1:16:43] life to the word it might require you
[1:16:46] and me dying to ourselves more
[1:16:50] the word is not just something we're
[1:16:52] accumulating and packing in the word is
[1:16:55] what wants to flow through us and
[1:16:58] release what God already has within us
[1:17:05] oh my These Are Spiritual powers that
[1:17:08] work
[1:17:10] this is why that Paul I read this I
[1:17:13] don't have time to read these scriptures
[1:17:15] but Paul would refer
[1:17:17] in the Ephesians 6 put on the whole
[1:17:20] armor of God
[1:17:22] it's not an outside armor it's an inner
[1:17:25] armor
[1:17:27] the armor of God is the word of God
[1:17:30] it's not a ladder it's a spirit of God
[1:17:35] it's a spirit of God his word wrapped up
[1:17:38] inside our life by the baptism of the
[1:17:40] Holy Ghost
[1:17:42] now why is that because
[1:17:44] that we might stand against the Wows of
[1:17:47] the devil let me just say this to you in
[1:17:49] case you don't know Satan is constantly
[1:17:52] on the onslaught and an attack against
[1:17:55] the work of the Holy Spirit
[1:17:57] no matter what he's done so far in your
[1:18:00] life whether you've went all the way
[1:18:01] into the new birth or it's just become
[1:18:03] justification or sanctification he is
[1:18:07] against the work of the Holy Spirit
[1:18:12] it's a spirit these you and I walk
[1:18:15] around and we can try to manipulate you
[1:18:18] know sometimes you'd see how they you
[1:18:20] know it's like with psychology wanting
[1:18:22] to manipulate people in their minds
[1:18:24] manipulate things and we'll just change
[1:18:27] this and and alter this
[1:18:29] you recognize that it's not psychology
[1:18:32] can never produce a real change in a
[1:18:36] person's life
[1:18:38] if it could have then God when he became
[1:18:41] flesh he should have sent a psychology
[1:18:43] book
[1:18:44] I'm not against psychologists but I'm
[1:18:46] trying to say if we're relying on that
[1:18:49] instead of the Holy Spirit we've got our
[1:18:51] rest and our hope in might and power and
[1:18:54] it'll never work
[1:18:56] because the Devil is a smart shrewd
[1:18:59] fellow he's more subtle than everyone
[1:19:03] there's only one that can outdo the
[1:19:05] devil and that's the Holy Ghost
[1:19:10] the holy spirit is not he does not come
[1:19:13] to shame us he comes to break the hold
[1:19:17] that Satan would want to have Upon Our
[1:19:20] Lives
[1:19:23] Hallelujah do you realize sitting in a
[1:19:25] service like this here this morning do
[1:19:27] you realize
[1:19:28] that there are two spiritual powers that
[1:19:30] work right now
[1:19:34] let's not be coy it's not just the
[1:19:36] spirit of God in this place right here
[1:19:38] right now
[1:19:39] remember when the sons of God come to
[1:19:42] worship you've heard it we're preached
[1:19:44] it on the Thursday nights brother
[1:19:45] Connery was just here on Thursday night
[1:19:46] when the sons of God Came To Worship
[1:19:49] Satan never said oh I'll stay home and
[1:19:51] stream that
[1:19:55] Satan said I'm streaming that I'm going
[1:19:59] are you hearing me now
[1:20:00] so here what we find is two spiritual
[1:20:03] Powers right here at work even in a
[1:20:07] meeting and while it's going on
[1:20:10] you know why it's a war it's trying to
[1:20:12] get positioned Satan wants to get
[1:20:15] positioned God's designed to get
[1:20:17] positioned let me just say this to you
[1:20:19] Satan is no match for God
[1:20:26] he's no match for God
[1:20:28] [Applause]
[1:20:33] the right here gathered what is it faith
[1:20:37] doubt there's paddling that's going on
[1:20:40] it's Satan that's wanting to tear down
[1:20:43] and move around and all of those things
[1:20:45] this is why the battles that we face
[1:20:48] it's not against flesh and blood
[1:20:51] you let a person make a decision to
[1:20:54] serve God and you watch all hell will
[1:20:57] come against them
[1:20:58] wife will raise up husband will raise up
[1:21:00] family will raise up it's not the people
[1:21:03] it's demon spirits
[1:21:05] that's inspiring them
[1:21:09] that's exactly why it is this is why
[1:21:12] that when a person I sit here and watch
[1:21:14] this that when a person can start to get
[1:21:16] close to God something will raise up and
[1:21:18] say if you keep going there if you keep
[1:21:21] doing that I'll leave you it becomes a
[1:21:23] real Showdown
[1:21:25] let me tell you something nobody's yoked
[1:21:28] up in hell
[1:21:29] let me just be honest with you there
[1:21:31] ain't no buddies in hell
[1:21:34] oh there is in hell is a lot of finger
[1:21:36] pointing
[1:21:37] wives will be pointing the finger at the
[1:21:39] husband you didn't leave the home right
[1:21:44] you didn't tell me when my dress wasn't
[1:21:46] appropriate you didn't Point me you
[1:21:48] didn't sit down with me and the husbands
[1:21:50] will sit down and say well you did this
[1:21:52] and you did that and husbands will look
[1:21:54] around to their buddies
[1:21:56] but there won't be no buddies in hell
[1:22:01] come on now
[1:22:02] and everybody believe hell's a real
[1:22:04] place
[1:22:05] hell ain't no figment of imagination if
[1:22:07] it is Heavens a figment too
[1:22:11] Heaven Ain't a figment Heaven is real
[1:22:14] [Applause]
[1:22:18] I mean they go to heaven
[1:22:20] cause they say they believe the message
[1:22:21] does not mean they go to heaven just
[1:22:24] because they're a good person does not
[1:22:26] mean they go to heaven heaven let me
[1:22:28] tell you something hell is filled with
[1:22:31] good people
[1:22:32] [Applause]
[1:22:35] brother Sammy I need some scripture glad
[1:22:37] you asked
[1:22:38] the Rich Young Ruler the Rich Young
[1:22:41] Ruler he stood before the presence of
[1:22:44] Jesus Christ and he stood right there
[1:22:47] and Jesus said what must I do to inherit
[1:22:50] eternal life he knew I know all about
[1:22:52] the message I know all about this a
[1:22:54] matter of fact I Rejoice around the
[1:22:56] message but he lacked something in his
[1:22:59] life
[1:23:00] it's more than just rejoicing around
[1:23:02] this message it's more than that you've
[1:23:05] got to have the substance it's got to
[1:23:07] take the spirit of God inside of your
[1:23:09] life
[1:23:11] the devil's not afraid because you
[1:23:13] recognize William Branham it was a
[1:23:15] prophet of God the devil's not afraid
[1:23:17] that you can just Rejoice at quotes on
[1:23:20] Sons and Daughters of God with before
[1:23:21] the foundation of the world but what he
[1:23:24] wants to do is keep it back from you
[1:23:26] rising up and saying that's me
[1:23:29] that's me
[1:23:30] [Music]
[1:23:32] I know you might look at me and say how
[1:23:34] could we be rejoicing and not saying
[1:23:36] it's me
[1:23:41] because
[1:23:43] spirit will come around
[1:23:45] and want to point things out
[1:23:49] why you are not worthy
[1:23:51] condemnation in your life where you know
[1:23:53] I'm not there yet what the message is
[1:23:56] calling for
[1:23:57] I believe this message I love this
[1:23:59] message but I'm not there yet
[1:24:02] you understand what I'm saying
[1:24:06] we're not talking about I don't think I
[1:24:08] should have to make this disclaimer I'm
[1:24:10] not talking about making this perfect
[1:24:11] but neither am I going to make excuses
[1:24:14] for this guy
[1:24:17] you understand like my dad told me when
[1:24:19] I was growing up boy you don't get out
[1:24:21] of bed don't expect to know for me to go
[1:24:23] into school
[1:24:26] of course after that car got taken and
[1:24:27] everything else you know don't expect
[1:24:29] that you're on your own
[1:24:31] you ain't sick get out of the bed so in
[1:24:33] other words quit writing excuses for
[1:24:36] this guy
[1:24:38] who do you think it is that tells you oh
[1:24:40] you're too bad to come to church or
[1:24:42] you're to this and you know you feel too
[1:24:45] bad and you who you think tells you that
[1:24:48] oh boy we're preaching now do I have to
[1:24:50] come down there and preach in the house
[1:24:52] I walk down the pews if I have to
[1:24:55] get about uncovering Satan
[1:24:59] we give him too much room the Bible said
[1:25:02] give no place to the devil
[1:25:07] friends it's things you're looking back
[1:25:09] to other examples let me tell you
[1:25:10] something you need to look back and
[1:25:12] deeper than just Mom and Dad because Mom
[1:25:14] and Dad might not be the example you
[1:25:16] need to look at you need to look clear
[1:25:18] back into Jesus Christ the Lamb's Book
[1:25:22] of Life
[1:25:23] [Applause]
[1:25:25] amen
[1:25:28] I'm talking about battling demon Spirits
[1:25:31] you're saying the song This Means War
[1:25:35] right right
[1:25:36] it's overcoming opposition and we don't
[1:25:38] overcome opposition by patting it around
[1:25:41] we've got to face the issue
[1:25:45] amen the word brings us to face the
[1:25:49] issue
[1:25:50] I want to face issues my flesh don't
[1:25:53] want to face them
[1:25:54] but my son but on the inside of the son
[1:25:57] and daughter of God I want to face him
[1:25:59] you know why because I realize it's
[1:26:02] Satan's desire to keep me back
[1:26:05] from all that God has for me
[1:26:09] so we're not wrestling against flesh and
[1:26:11] blood we are wrestling against Spirits
[1:26:13] principalities powers in Heavenly places
[1:26:17] and to understand that within this that
[1:26:20] Satan as Peter would write for you and I
[1:26:24] in verse 8 of First Peter 5 be sober
[1:26:27] it means being and be in her right mind
[1:26:33] I know we just kind of take that for
[1:26:34] granted but do you realize
[1:26:37] everything that's coming right through
[1:26:38] even Airwaves and everything else is
[1:26:41] there
[1:26:42] as the prophet could put it in this
[1:26:44] phrase to want to poison
[1:26:46] our minds
[1:26:50] I know it gets easy we talk about oh
[1:26:53] that person out there with blue hair oh
[1:26:56] boy it's so ungodly but remember I ain't
[1:27:00] talking about the people out there
[1:27:01] I'm talking about right here
[1:27:04] the Bible said that judgment it's time
[1:27:07] that judgment began at the house of God
[1:27:10] because we can feel pretty comfortable
[1:27:12] in looking at somebody else out there
[1:27:13] and say praise God you know I ain't like
[1:27:15] that that's called Pride
[1:27:17] and you know what pride is it's homemade
[1:27:21] it's got a homemade recipe you make it
[1:27:23] and you look down on somebody else and
[1:27:25] judge your life by somebody else that is
[1:27:28] not what a son and daughter of God does
[1:27:30] we do not judge our life by the world
[1:27:32] you judge your life by the word by the
[1:27:35] Holy Spirit as he's speaking to our
[1:27:37] lives
[1:27:39] I tell you he'll bring correction he'll
[1:27:42] bring out a vacation and if you're allow
[1:27:43] him to he will enable you and equip you
[1:27:47] with strength to stand against things in
[1:27:50] your life
[1:27:52] but see what Satan wants to do is get on
[1:27:55] your shoulder and you get offended
[1:27:59] oh I'm offended
[1:28:01] you hurt my feelings
[1:28:03] you hurt you know what that is that's a
[1:28:05] spirit of this age people's rights
[1:28:09] well let me just say this is clear
[1:28:10] you've got a right to go to hell too
[1:28:14] it's your right
[1:28:16] boy I thought we were having fire pit
[1:28:17] afterwards
[1:28:19] the preacher here
[1:28:21] come on friends let's listen God's not
[1:28:23] against us
[1:28:25] he's for us it's overcoming opposition
[1:28:28] does anybody like staying in the same
[1:28:30] place I don't want to stay in the same
[1:28:32] place because that's not moving on with
[1:28:34] God that's become bachelin that's become
[1:28:37] hypocrisy we want to move on with God in
[1:28:40] the power of almighty God in the power
[1:28:43] of His might
[1:28:45] what ordained from that brother joy to
[1:28:47] move
[1:28:48] when the Holy Spirit is here to move
[1:28:51] upon our life it's a time to move
[1:28:54] you realize the spirit of God through
[1:28:56] the prophet could say that when the Holy
[1:28:58] Spirit is here to inspire you he said
[1:29:02] confess what he is saying because God is
[1:29:06] here to make your body obey your
[1:29:08] confession who art thou old great
[1:29:11] Mountain because Aruba boy
[1:29:13] Thou shalt become a plane
[1:29:16] so we recognize the battle that set in
[1:29:19] in a ray all around us
[1:29:23] now this battle when we look at it as we
[1:29:26] mentioned of it last week
[1:29:29] of how Paul would Express
[1:29:33] to the church there
[1:29:35] in second Corinthians 11 3 I just want
[1:29:37] to jump to this scripture I fear less by
[1:29:41] any means as the serpent
[1:29:44] that was a vessel right
[1:29:47] the serpent was a vessel
[1:29:49] the serpent can say I'm one of God's
[1:29:51] creations
[1:29:53] come on now
[1:29:54] he won the slithering snake the Bible
[1:29:57] said he was a beast of the field
[1:30:01] are you with me he lost his position
[1:30:03] because of what he yielded himself too
[1:30:10] Hallelujah
[1:30:11] so if one yielding themselves in that
[1:30:14] way can go into a fall condition what
[1:30:17] about a child of God that will yield
[1:30:19] themselves to the word of God
[1:30:22] it'll take you back into your rightful
[1:30:26] position
[1:30:29] I fear less by any means as the serpent
[1:30:31] beguiled Eve through his satility so
[1:30:33] your minds somebody say they're with me
[1:30:36] your minds
[1:30:38] should be corrupted
[1:30:40] from the Simplicity that is in Christ
[1:30:45] so Satan's attack is there at the mind
[1:30:50] brother Sammy I thought it was there at
[1:30:52] the soul the Battleground is the mind
[1:30:55] the Battleground is no man's land
[1:30:59] are you with me the Battleground is
[1:31:01] where spiritual Powers they test their
[1:31:04] instruments
[1:31:09] Hallelujah they parade their nuclear
[1:31:11] submarines down through your mind
[1:31:14] come on let's just use some present
[1:31:16] figures
[1:31:18] they're flocked That's what Satan wants
[1:31:20] to do in the mind don't you realize that
[1:31:22] when David came out there to face
[1:31:24] Goliath David never said man you're
[1:31:26] pretty good with the slingshot but what
[1:31:28] goliath said to David was he said you
[1:31:31] ain't nothing but a youth
[1:31:34] right right you're ready
[1:31:37] there ain't nothing to you but that's
[1:31:40] just what you can see in the visible
[1:31:41] room
[1:31:44] you see Goliath wasn't gifted to see the
[1:31:48] supernatural Realm
[1:31:50] he was being influenced by demons but he
[1:31:54] couldn't see what David was standing and
[1:31:57] representing my my if his eyes could
[1:32:01] have been opened he would have solved
[1:32:03] the same Myriad and host of angels
[1:32:06] because when David said I'm not coming
[1:32:09] at you in the name of a church in the
[1:32:12] name of a family I'm not coming to you
[1:32:14] in the name of a Doctrine I'm coming to
[1:32:17] you in the name of the Lord of hosts
[1:32:22] the Lord is mighty in battle you know
[1:32:25] what host means it means that which is
[1:32:27] indivisible and unseen Realm
[1:32:32] the angels of God were gathered there
[1:32:39] you're nothing but a youth
[1:32:41] I will lift you I will I will feed your
[1:32:43] carcass
[1:32:45] to the foul there what's he trying to do
[1:32:47] get in his mind
[1:32:49] getting his mind
[1:32:51] that's the same way listen to me now
[1:32:53] that's the same way he'll come to every
[1:32:55] one of us
[1:32:56] no matter what it is you're facing
[1:33:00] you'll try to come in your mind I don't
[1:33:02] care if it's sin I don't care if it's
[1:33:03] disease I don't care if it's
[1:33:04] condemnation that didn't matter what it
[1:33:06] is he'll try to come in your mind
[1:33:10] and what he's pointing to is physical
[1:33:13] stature he's pointing to your abilities
[1:33:16] but not by power
[1:33:18] not by might
[1:33:21] but by my spirit saith the Lord
[1:33:25] and if we can recognize that the spirit
[1:33:28] of God is here I'm a Child of God
[1:33:32] well that should have been a little bit
[1:33:34] more amen
[1:33:35] I'm a Child of God
[1:33:38] I am redeemed let the redeemed of the
[1:33:40] Lord say so let the wheat say I am
[1:33:42] strong
[1:33:44] well I'm weak I'm not even going to come
[1:33:46] to church that's the dumbest decision
[1:33:47] you could ever make
[1:33:51] sorry just shooting plane
[1:33:54] don't even make sense that's like saying
[1:33:56] you know I'm hungry but I ain't gonna
[1:33:57] eat
[1:33:58] how foolish is that
[1:34:01] it's a place to get strength from it's
[1:34:03] not this building
[1:34:06] are you hearing me
[1:34:08] it's drawing strength from El Shady eye
[1:34:12] that's why we come and We Gather here in
[1:34:15] this place
[1:34:21] and God rewards sacrifice
[1:34:24] I said God reward sacrifice
[1:34:26] and just to check it where is your
[1:34:28] sacrifice at
[1:34:30] [Music]
[1:34:32] are you sacrificing for the right things
[1:34:36] or some people you couldn't keep them at
[1:34:38] home for a social event
[1:34:42] oh dear God they wouldn't miss a social
[1:34:43] event but church becomes optional
[1:34:47] I'm telling you what it is your backslip
[1:34:52] there's another spirit
[1:34:53] working on your life
[1:34:58] honey maybe we just be the ones
[1:34:59] fellowshipping around the fire tonight
[1:35:01] you preaching
[1:35:03] that's good do you think God's against
[1:35:05] you
[1:35:06] you think I'm against you
[1:35:08] not at all it's not you it's a spirit
[1:35:12] you see God has equipped that part of it
[1:35:15] to see there's times that you can't see
[1:35:17] things about your life but thanks be to
[1:35:20] God that God knows and he sees about our
[1:35:23] life and God doesn't say Joshua you're
[1:35:26] not worthy of me that's not what he does
[1:35:28] but he comes down to do what deal with
[1:35:31] the opposing spirit
[1:35:34] it's running to oppose the work of the
[1:35:38] holy spirit in your life
[1:35:41] that's why he would want you just to
[1:35:42] settle for some cheap counterfeit
[1:35:47] like we were talking to the young people
[1:35:50] I'm speaking to them on Friday night
[1:35:51] well we were collectively together had
[1:35:54] just a wonderful time there on Friday
[1:35:56] night with famine we were just right
[1:35:58] there together sitting around and
[1:35:59] speaking but just as we speak about
[1:36:01] things I said you look at influences
[1:36:04] back there we can talk about Elvis
[1:36:06] Presley you had young people there that
[1:36:09] were looking at Elvis Presley say well
[1:36:11] he's a Christian
[1:36:13] so because somebody says they're
[1:36:15] Christian does that make them a
[1:36:16] Christian
[1:36:16] no
[1:36:18] knew
[1:36:20] what makes a Christian a Christian
[1:36:23] well because they reflect god well I
[1:36:25] know some people that can reflect
[1:36:26] attributes they can be kind
[1:36:30] you know maybe the seventh day of the
[1:36:32] week but they can be kind
[1:36:37] no what separates
[1:36:39] it makes a real Christian is the Holy
[1:36:42] Ghost
[1:36:43] that's why brother Brandon could tell us
[1:36:45] in the Holy Ghost series he said there's
[1:36:46] a difference between just a Christian
[1:36:50] and a holy ghost-filled Christian
[1:36:53] because the Holy Ghost feel Christian it
[1:36:55] is Christ on the inside living out his
[1:36:59] life you think a real Christian don't
[1:37:01] have trials and tribulation and trouble
[1:37:03] and have to battle against coldness sure
[1:37:06] but there is an effer present God that
[1:37:10] is there within their life there's a
[1:37:12] desire that beats for God a desire that
[1:37:15] longs for God a desire that says I can't
[1:37:18] get enough of him I need more of Jesus
[1:37:22] foreign
[1:37:23] that's what the real Holy Ghost does it
[1:37:26] gives you a desire for God
[1:37:31] not just well I'm good enough I don't
[1:37:33] drink no more I don't smoke no more I
[1:37:36] don't look at stuff on the internet no
[1:37:37] more no the Holy Ghost is there to live
[1:37:41] inside of you
[1:37:43] [Music]
[1:37:49] Lord God is dealing with opposing
[1:37:52] spirits
[1:37:54] yeah that's true
[1:37:58] when God sends his word
[1:38:01] it comes straight from his throne
[1:38:05] he maketh his angels
[1:38:11] flames of fire
[1:38:15] that's Hebrews one he maketh
[1:38:19] flames of fire
[1:38:21] what if fire is it it's the fire of God
[1:38:25] it's the same consuming fire God has a
[1:38:27] consuming fire the same fire that
[1:38:29] consumed the sacrifice is the same fire
[1:38:31] that came and got in them on the day of
[1:38:33] Pentecost
[1:38:36] but the Samuel why is that important I'm
[1:38:38] glad you asked that
[1:38:46] you ever take a balloon
[1:38:47] maybe you did you didn't I hate loud
[1:38:49] noises so I always hate it when they
[1:38:51] want to do stuff like this
[1:38:52] but they take a balloon and just fill it
[1:38:54] up with hair and you put it over heat
[1:38:56] a flame what's it going to do
[1:39:00] come on man say it with confidence
[1:39:02] what's it going to do
[1:39:08] I'm going to take you around back after
[1:39:10] church
[1:39:14] it pops right you put a flame on it on a
[1:39:16] balloon it pops
[1:39:18] but you know if you take that same
[1:39:20] balloon and you put water in it
[1:39:22] and you hold it over a flame it won't
[1:39:24] pop
[1:39:26] you know why it don't mean that he ain't
[1:39:27] there but it's got something inside it
[1:39:29] that's able to change the temperatures
[1:39:31] it's got something inside of the table
[1:39:33] to adjust the Temptations
[1:39:37] that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:39:41] it don't mean that we're not over the
[1:39:42] Bunsen burner and the Flames going but
[1:39:44] we've got something inside us that's
[1:39:46] able to move when Satan comes this way
[1:39:48] it's able to water moves this way what
[1:39:50] is it it's a holy spirit because this
[1:39:52] right here alone not by power not by
[1:39:56] might it would pop
[1:39:58] without the water of the Holy Ghost
[1:40:01] that's why we must have the Holy Ghost
[1:40:06] by my Spirit saith the Lord of hosts
[1:40:10] God sends his spirit
[1:40:14] he sins
[1:40:15] his angels now Satan's got angels too we
[1:40:17] talked about that last week right
[1:40:19] Satan's got angels too and they're not
[1:40:21] lazy they are they're workers
[1:40:23] the Bible calls them deceitful workers
[1:40:27] transforming themselves into Apostles of
[1:40:29] right
[1:40:32] this is new understanding
[1:40:36] if it doesn't match with a word
[1:40:42] are you hitting me this isn't just
[1:40:43] something we're looking at out here
[1:40:45] examining in here
[1:40:48] does my reasoning match the word of God
[1:40:50] if it doesn't get rid of it if my
[1:40:53] imagination does not match God's word
[1:40:55] get rid of it
[1:40:58] yeah and you know what I'm grateful that
[1:40:59] the spirit of God he maketh his angels
[1:41:01] flames of fire that the spirit of God
[1:41:03] can come and minister to you and I as
[1:41:05] Sons and Daughters of God and reveal
[1:41:07] Satan's attempted destruction of Our
[1:41:10] Lives
[1:41:11] the Bible said that be sober and
[1:41:13] diligent
[1:41:15] because your adversary
[1:41:17] not your buddy
[1:41:19] right not your friend on Facebook or
[1:41:22] Instagram or SnapChat or whatever
[1:41:25] no no your adversary
[1:41:28] I think we all agree the devil's an
[1:41:30] adversary
[1:41:31] but remember
[1:41:32] he goeth about like a roaring lion
[1:41:36] seeking whom he may devour
[1:41:39] his duty his job is to destroy God's
[1:41:44] creation Satan would love nothing more
[1:41:47] than to destroy your life
[1:41:50] he would love nothing more than for you
[1:41:52] to stop right where you're at
[1:41:58] but like Elijah or Elisha told gehazer
[1:42:02] remember when the sunamite woman came
[1:42:03] she said I've got a knee my child is
[1:42:06] dead we laid him in the upper room The
[1:42:08] Prophet's chamber he's dead I put him up
[1:42:11] there
[1:42:15] and Elisha told Geezer you take this
[1:42:17] staff and you go
[1:42:19] and I don't want you stopping I don't
[1:42:21] care who comes in your wake don't you
[1:42:22] stop for nothing
[1:42:25] you know what that's saying you've got
[1:42:27] authority to override every opposition
[1:42:33] you've got authority to override every
[1:42:37] obstacle why you've got a prophet's word
[1:42:39] that has come from the Throne of God
[1:42:43] what is it it's the king's message it's
[1:42:46] the king's scepter
[1:42:48] [Applause]
[1:42:49] it's the scepter of the King You've Got
[1:42:52] authority to say get out of my way devil
[1:42:56] if it's condemnation get out of my way
[1:42:59] you say how do I say get out of my way
[1:43:01] repent
[1:43:04] that's saying get out of the way
[1:43:06] don't just push him back because he'll
[1:43:09] be right there to greet you when you get
[1:43:10] out
[1:43:14] steam out
[1:43:16] and that's why God sends his servants he
[1:43:20] maketh his and his ministers
[1:43:23] angels
[1:43:25] angels
[1:43:27] ministering spirits that do what
[1:43:30] Minister the spirit of the word
[1:43:34] not just the word because the word alone
[1:43:38] killeth but the spirit giveth life
[1:43:42] see the ministering of the spirit of the
[1:43:44] word what does it do it opens up the
[1:43:47] vision over our life
[1:43:49] to where you can look
[1:43:51] and Satan can point out all your faults
[1:43:54] all your failures
[1:43:57] let me tell you something you can sit
[1:43:58] right here this morning and say
[1:44:00] he's preaching all over me and not
[1:44:02] preaching all over you
[1:44:04] it's God wanting to free you
[1:44:10] now if you want to live by kerosene lamp
[1:44:12] that's your choice
[1:44:14] but you don't have to live by a kerosene
[1:44:16] lamp
[1:44:17] there's electricity here
[1:44:21] there's a power here that can light your
[1:44:23] life up
[1:44:25] that'll illuminate your life like never
[1:44:27] before don't let the devil crouch in on
[1:44:29] you well you believe the message you've
[1:44:32] believed a message for a long time you
[1:44:34] remember no we match it with the word of
[1:44:37] God what does your life say right now
[1:44:40] with the word of God
[1:44:42] does your word does your life say Amen
[1:44:45] to the word of God
[1:44:47] if it doesn't the a manner is here
[1:44:51] if you've got cold the a minor is here
[1:44:55] come on Fred don't you hang your head
[1:44:57] because well I'm so sad I got down I got
[1:44:59] cold that's a spirit wanting to anoint
[1:45:02] you with self-pity reject that Devil
[1:45:05] he's wanting to hold you back
[1:45:09] what do I do stand face to face because
[1:45:12] that is death stand under the anointing
[1:45:16] of life and say Satan
[1:45:19] you that wanted to hold me back
[1:45:21] your scheme is exposed what are you
[1:45:25] going to do stand on the Lord's Side
[1:45:30] because he is the captain of our
[1:45:33] salvation
[1:45:34] you know what salvation is Deliverance
[1:45:38] he's the captain of our deliverance he's
[1:45:41] a five-star general
[1:45:43] he's never lost a battle
[1:45:47] the Simplicity that Satan would love to
[1:45:50] corrupt the minds from
[1:45:52] is that true Liberty
[1:45:54] that's in Jesus Christ
[1:45:57] and let me tell you something
[1:45:58] he conquered every demon I could read a
[1:46:01] Litany of scriptures I could cover we
[1:46:03] could get covered up in scripture right
[1:46:04] here I don't have to read them over and
[1:46:07] over through the script because it's
[1:46:08] true he is above every principality
[1:46:13] every Power
[1:46:16] I don't care what new disease comes up I
[1:46:19] don't care what Greek letter they put on
[1:46:21] it I don't listen friends we're talking
[1:46:23] about the word of God
[1:46:26] why are you hearing me
[1:46:28] you know it's one thing it's one thing
[1:46:30] when things come our way and then we're
[1:46:32] faced with it within our own home
[1:46:37] right
[1:46:38] we're faced with they win our own home
[1:46:40] but what are we going to do about it
[1:46:44] Satan comes and wants to make an attack
[1:46:47] it doesn't matter who who you are it
[1:46:50] doesn't matter if it's me
[1:46:51] you think Satan is trying to send the
[1:46:53] tax right here
[1:46:55] it wants to send a tax
[1:46:57] because if he can get a leader a
[1:46:59] Shepherd weakened man he can have Heyday
[1:47:01] with the flock
[1:47:04] oh my
[1:47:06] same thing in your lives Brothers as
[1:47:08] husbands
[1:47:10] fathers grandfathers same thing in this
[1:47:13] church
[1:47:17] talking about angels you know what we're
[1:47:19] under right now the anointing of the
[1:47:22] Holy Ghost
[1:47:24] that's who's Discerning your heart
[1:47:27] that's who's Discerning your life
[1:47:29] don't worry because brother Samuel you
[1:47:31] know me I don't got Facebook I don't
[1:47:33] want it
[1:47:34] I don't have Instagram I don't want it
[1:47:38] I have to speak to the young people and
[1:47:40] work with them on those things I don't
[1:47:42] want the stuff you know why I don't got
[1:47:44] time for it
[1:47:49] because you probably got family like I
[1:47:51] got
[1:47:53] that if you look at their trash book I
[1:47:55] mean their Facebook page all it is is
[1:47:57] trash
[1:47:59] and all them spewing all their their
[1:48:02] political stuff here and there not as
[1:48:05] Sons and Daughters of God
[1:48:09] brother random said what where your
[1:48:11] Uzziah failed is he got caught up in
[1:48:13] politics the church is not a political
[1:48:17] machine
[1:48:19] we do not live Victorious because of
[1:48:21] politics
[1:48:25] Trump did not help us live in Liberty
[1:48:28] it's because the Council of God was his
[1:48:32] present that our lives would move under
[1:48:35] the influence of the Holy Spirit
[1:48:37] [Music]
[1:48:40] Lori hey
[1:48:43] that's awful strong brother Sammy I love
[1:48:46] my country I think you'll love it more
[1:48:48] than you love God
[1:48:51] shame on you
[1:48:53] where have you fallen from
[1:48:59] you know and all about it ain't gonna
[1:49:00] straighten it all out
[1:49:03] the thing you need to be ready for this
[1:49:05] life is not about this life
[1:49:08] this life are you hearing me it's not
[1:49:11] about this life
[1:49:12] this life is about the next life
[1:49:17] [Applause]
[1:49:23] of assemble what are you saying don't
[1:49:24] give me an excuse for what you're
[1:49:26] indulging in
[1:49:29] because the reason you're indulging it
[1:49:30] because you're lacking spiritually
[1:49:34] and you know what you've got to find
[1:49:35] someplace something to fill that void
[1:49:39] come on some people they will find the
[1:49:42] god of sports to fill their void
[1:49:45] right even if it is ungodly people
[1:49:48] come on I don't have to leave and go 30
[1:49:51] some miles from here you know what I'm
[1:49:52] talking about
[1:49:56] and put the god of sports
[1:49:59] you know why you know what that is
[1:50:01] there's a lacking it shows there's a
[1:50:03] place in your life that God wants to
[1:50:05] feel
[1:50:08] it oh brother Samuel I don't believe
[1:50:10] God's against Sports well I never said
[1:50:12] God was against sports but sometimes
[1:50:15] those things get said like that
[1:50:17] to just make room
[1:50:21] how much room is it in your life
[1:50:25] getting quiet now how much room
[1:50:27] [Applause]
[1:50:28] you know more about their stats and
[1:50:30] everything else and hadn't even prayed
[1:50:32] and listened to a message
[1:50:33] [Music]
[1:50:35] I'm talking about spiritual opposition
[1:50:39] don't you realize Samson the Philistines
[1:50:43] are upon you
[1:50:45] thank you
[1:50:47] you know I've already left the notes
[1:50:49] long time ago
[1:50:53] I'm talking about who likes our old
[1:50:56] great Mountain you've got to face that
[1:50:58] mountain stop letting the devil put it
[1:51:00] off letting him some shove it to another
[1:51:03] service do you realize if you and your
[1:51:06] mind entertain a thought I'll do it on
[1:51:08] Thursday I'll get it next week
[1:51:11] brother Branham takes us right into the
[1:51:12] message of by faith
[1:51:15] faith is the victory he said if Satan
[1:51:17] can get you to think that he said you'll
[1:51:19] get up from this Altar and walk out the
[1:51:21] same person
[1:51:23] it's got to become between life and
[1:51:25] death I would not be too ashamed to say
[1:51:28] God I need more
[1:51:32] oh brother the same night he went to the
[1:51:34] altar ones what's stopping you from
[1:51:36] coming again
[1:51:38] God never took the altar out of church
[1:51:41] all the altars in my heart the altars in
[1:51:43] my mind are you using it
[1:51:47] are you using it
[1:51:49] God never took this out you can never
[1:51:51] have more enough of the Lord oh I got
[1:51:54] enough that's what the spirit of this
[1:51:56] age says I'm rich increased with goods
[1:51:59] and I Don't Need No More Jesus
[1:52:02] but they'll say they love Jesus right
[1:52:05] give them a few scriptures because
[1:52:07] remember Jesus says the word may flesh
[1:52:08] is that right give them a few scriptures
[1:52:10] and see if they love Jesus because Jesus
[1:52:12] ain't something different from his word
[1:52:15] that's what Satan's desire has been to
[1:52:18] corrupt the mind
[1:52:21] because you know why the real gospel
[1:52:23] brings Liberty to your life
[1:52:27] he ascended far above every principality
[1:52:30] every Power
[1:52:33] and it's his anointing
[1:52:35] that comes to break
[1:52:37] the yoke
[1:52:42] that same Pillar of Fire
[1:52:46] he's here
[1:52:48] well bless him you're just saying it no
[1:52:50] he's here
[1:52:51] he's here
[1:52:53] he's here
[1:52:54] he's the one he's the one that brings
[1:52:56] the message
[1:52:57] he's the one that inspires me I don't
[1:53:01] I don't apologize for that right as
[1:53:03] Believers we know that and we expect it
[1:53:05] who you think it is that moves you to
[1:53:07] pray
[1:53:08] who do you think it is that moves you to
[1:53:10] read
[1:53:11] who do you think it is that moves you to
[1:53:13] you know what it's been a while I've let
[1:53:15] some things creep into my life who do
[1:53:17] you think it is that moves
[1:53:20] to that place let me tell you who it is
[1:53:23] it's the angel of the Lord
[1:53:26] and he's wanting to influence your life
[1:53:27] you know why so that you don't become so
[1:53:30] bound up so Twisted so tied up because
[1:53:33] let me tell you something if you can
[1:53:34] look back
[1:53:35] a few months ago or a year ago and you
[1:53:37] can say man I ain't as ferving as I was
[1:53:39] before there's Grace right here this
[1:53:42] morning
[1:53:44] I said did you hear me there's Grace
[1:53:45] right here at this moment
[1:53:47] there's a there is a strength with the
[1:53:50] spirit of the Lord in our life because
[1:53:52] it's safe to desire he wants to get us
[1:53:54] all just settled down
[1:53:56] that's been his trick down Through the
[1:53:59] Ages is to get them all settled down in
[1:54:02] Zion
[1:54:04] get everybody settled down you know in
[1:54:06] the message that they had received in
[1:54:07] that day they get settled down they get
[1:54:10] comfortable and let me tell you
[1:54:12] something this is right here where the
[1:54:14] devil's fighting
[1:54:16] and one of the things right now we could
[1:54:18] look at and say well I'll tell you I'm
[1:54:19] still in church I still believe the
[1:54:20] message I still that ain't what that is
[1:54:22] not what oh well I must be going
[1:54:24] everything must be going on good Satan
[1:54:27] is fine with you just being
[1:54:30] just a warm body on a pew
[1:54:33] he's okay it don't disturb him if you
[1:54:36] say you believe the message that don't
[1:54:37] bother him
[1:54:38] yeah right right matter of fact he won't
[1:54:41] even send his alarm clock on it and get
[1:54:43] out of bed
[1:54:44] he don't bother him that you can quote
[1:54:46] the message
[1:54:48] but what'll get him up off of his bed
[1:54:51] is when that life goes to start living
[1:54:53] through you
[1:54:58] some of you know right where I'm at on a
[1:55:00] quote
[1:55:01] brother bam tells us when the day of
[1:55:03] Pentecost had fully come Satan didn't
[1:55:04] even get out of his bed
[1:55:07] and they were filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:55:08] but Satan didn't even get out of the bed
[1:55:10] but when the man at the gate called
[1:55:12] Beautiful got healed what was it it was
[1:55:14] the life
[1:55:15] working in the body
[1:55:18] that same life that overcome every demon
[1:55:21] spirit and every Spirit had to bow in
[1:55:24] subjection to the authority of Jesus
[1:55:26] Christ he got upset when that Authority
[1:55:30] was working in the body
[1:55:32] because the whole purpose of redemption
[1:55:34] is that he might dwell inside of his
[1:55:37] creation
[1:55:41] it's the anointing that breaks the yoke
[1:55:45] it's anointing
[1:55:48] let me read this to you in closing
[1:55:52] it's just a
[1:55:53] wow
[1:55:55] a quote right here that I want to read
[1:55:56] to you
[1:56:00] the ram says a sinner I don't have it in
[1:56:02] there don't look for it brother Brown
[1:56:04] says this a sinner comes to the Altar
[1:56:06] and says brother Branham
[1:56:08] I want you to pray for me I want to be
[1:56:09] good I want you just to pray for me and
[1:56:11] you go back in your seat
[1:56:14] whether I'm saying on the next the next
[1:56:15] night
[1:56:16] he said I'll say how many wants to be
[1:56:17] saved
[1:56:19] he said here the same man stands up you
[1:56:21] want to be saved young man yes sir well
[1:56:23] why don't you get saved
[1:56:25] I don't know
[1:56:26] he said see the devil's holding that boy
[1:56:31] he wants
[1:56:33] to do right
[1:56:35] are you hearing me he wants to do right
[1:56:43] but there's a spirit a power
[1:56:46] that won't let him do right
[1:56:50] he wants to do right but there's a power
[1:56:53] that won't let him do right
[1:56:56] another man said oh Hallelujah here it
[1:56:58] is no wonder God would let a true man of
[1:57:01] God
[1:57:02] he would never let him say that he could
[1:57:04] heal somebody because Christ done that
[1:57:06] when he died are you catching what's
[1:57:07] saying here
[1:57:09] no man heals you
[1:57:12] it's not the man's hands it's not even
[1:57:16] the man's prayer
[1:57:19] it's your faith in a finished work
[1:57:25] man amen all right
[1:57:29] this is about the Simplicity of Christ
[1:57:32] I couldn't save nobody no one else could
[1:57:35] save anybody but God and he said and God
[1:57:38] can't save you because he's already
[1:57:41] done it
[1:57:46] you see it be like you trying to pay a
[1:57:47] hospital bill that somebody's already
[1:57:48] paid
[1:57:51] you've got to come to terms somebody
[1:57:53] paid my debt oh yeah somebody paid what
[1:57:58] was to stand against me what the devil
[1:58:00] would try to use against you and say
[1:58:02] you're not worthy
[1:58:04] but Christ already paid the way
[1:58:09] he already made a way that's why he
[1:58:11] comes to deal with you God is not
[1:58:14] dealing with your life because he can't
[1:58:16] help you he's dealing with your life
[1:58:18] because he is the worthy one
[1:58:22] to help you
[1:58:26] he's already done it the only thing you
[1:58:27] have to do
[1:58:29] is accepted and you know that's the
[1:58:31] hardest thing
[1:58:33] that's the hardest thing
[1:58:34] is for us to accept it it requires us to
[1:58:36] surrender
[1:58:37] to accept it
[1:58:39] not sit around and try to well let me
[1:58:41] accept it
[1:58:43] now come on let's not make this as hard
[1:58:45] if I had you know 20 in my wallet I'd be
[1:58:48] happy but if I had twenty dollars in my
[1:58:50] wallet and I pulled it out
[1:58:52] I'm sure if I went to pull that out
[1:58:55] your Lord I'd have to have armor bearers
[1:58:56] to protect me
[1:58:58] right
[1:58:59] pulling out in today's economy and it
[1:59:01] may burn up in your hand
[1:59:04] but I've had 120 Bill 100 bill you know
[1:59:06] what and I said you know what
[1:59:08] I want you to take this
[1:59:10] and I want you to go buy lunch today
[1:59:12] with this
[1:59:14] you know what I guarantee and you might
[1:59:16] say Oh Brother Sam that's that's all
[1:59:17] right but it really in your heart like
[1:59:18] pray you don't put our heck in his
[1:59:19] wallet I'm not just trying to be humble
[1:59:21] because on the second time around I'm
[1:59:22] Gonna Take It
[1:59:27] yeah true right yes sir sometimes we
[1:59:30] think being humble is saying Lord I'm
[1:59:31] not worthy that ain't being humble
[1:59:33] that's called being prideful
[1:59:35] and that's a spirit of pride
[1:59:38] that I can help myself know we need his
[1:59:41] help
[1:59:43] brother Banner will put it just like
[1:59:45] this he said there's an old God
[1:59:46] dishonoring proverb that said God helps
[1:59:49] those who helps themselves he said
[1:59:51] that's a lie God helps those who cannot
[1:59:53] help themselves
[1:59:56] God don't shame anybody because of the
[1:59:58] condition they're in but he lets them
[2:00:00] know I am your Waymaker I am your
[2:00:03] deliverer I am the one that comes the
[2:00:06] loose and the holds upon your life
[2:00:10] Hallelujah that's not the anointing of
[2:00:12] an evil spirit that's the anointing of
[2:00:14] the Holy Spirit
[2:00:16] is the angels of God that are set and
[2:00:18] rather around you this morning that's
[2:00:20] nudging you and saying this is for you
[2:00:28] back him a hundred dollars
[2:00:31] Mr Amanda I think you would maybe you
[2:00:33] you would take it and say I'm going to
[2:00:34] go to lunch with that
[2:00:36] I'm sure you wouldn't be going to
[2:00:37] McDonald's either
[2:00:38] yeah
[2:00:40] I better not say anything about
[2:00:41] McDonald's but
[2:00:42] 100 I guarantee what you do you don't
[2:00:45] you think you know what I'm gonna go
[2:00:47] somewhere and I'm gonna get me a good
[2:00:48] steak
[2:00:49] right
[2:00:50] as soon as that touched your hand like
[2:00:52] that you'd start thinking about them
[2:00:54] rolls that butter that steak and all
[2:00:57] those things that you could
[2:01:01] and do you realize
[2:01:03] to accept Jesus Christ
[2:01:05] to accept what he's already done for you
[2:01:08] is easier than that yeah
[2:01:12] it's just what must I do just as much if
[2:01:15] I wanted to give you that hundred
[2:01:16] dollars you wouldn't sit there with your
[2:01:17] hands in your pockets
[2:01:19] you know what you do
[2:01:23] right come on now
[2:01:26] you'd reach out and take it that's what
[2:01:28] you have to do with the word of God
[2:01:31] when the word of God is coming forth
[2:01:33] God's dealing with their life they'll
[2:01:34] sit with your hands in your pocket but
[2:01:36] reach out and take it bring it home
[2:01:38] it'll change your life it'll change your
[2:01:41] mind it'll change your nature it'll
[2:01:44] change your desires it'll change you
[2:01:46] from sickness to hell
[2:01:47] [Applause]
[2:01:51] truth
[2:01:56] he said I was saved 1900 years ago
[2:02:01] I just received it and I just accepted
[2:02:03] it
[2:02:05] I was healed
[2:02:06] 1900 years ago you got a disease or an
[2:02:09] infirmity or something's bothering you
[2:02:10] in your body
[2:02:11] you were healed
[2:02:14] before the foundation of the world
[2:02:19] you said brother Samuel
[2:02:21] right there you just read 1900 years ago
[2:02:24] that's when Isaiah 53 was manifested
[2:02:27] right
[2:02:27] but when Isaiah stood right there the
[2:02:29] spirit of God picked him up and he said
[2:02:31] he was
[2:02:34] wounded
[2:02:37] I might not be that smart but I know was
[2:02:38] it's past tense
[2:02:40] you know why from the mind of God it was
[2:02:43] a finished work
[2:02:45] and if the devil couldn't stop that bear
[2:02:48] he can't stop it here
[2:02:54] what do I do accept it foreign
[2:03:00] right now in this presence
[2:03:03] where the spirit of God is present to
[2:03:06] break every spirit
[2:03:08] right now you know you know there's
[2:03:10] things that's lifted oppression from off
[2:03:12] of your life
[2:03:14] what are you saying brother Samuel I'm
[2:03:16] telling you a spirit
[2:03:18] that's wanted to keep you back but right
[2:03:20] here under the anointed preaching of the
[2:03:22] word of God it's done something for you
[2:03:25] then more pictures can do you could look
[2:03:27] at the mirror all you want to look at
[2:03:29] and all you'd see is the same sorry old
[2:03:31] person that can't do nothing about his
[2:03:33] ways but right here in the presence of
[2:03:36] God there is a mirror that you can look
[2:03:39] into it is a mere a perfect Liberty a
[2:03:43] mirror of the glory of God not a mirror
[2:03:46] where you see yourself as a defeated
[2:03:48] helpless worthless being but you see
[2:03:51] yourself as a son and daughter of God
[2:03:55] amen then I'm not worthless
[2:03:59] I'm somebody
[2:04:02] he came all the way from Glory from me
[2:04:06] he shed his blood for me
[2:04:09] he sent the Holy Ghost for me
[2:04:15] he came to break the hold of opposition
[2:04:18] from around my life
[2:04:23] the brand goes on to say and I'm closing
[2:04:25] right here
[2:04:27] he said but once that spirit
[2:04:30] is broken right around that young man's
[2:04:32] life
[2:04:35] then it can be saved
[2:04:38] what is it it's a spirit
[2:04:41] but God has sent his word
[2:04:46] to cast out
[2:04:47] the unclean spirits
[2:04:50] I'll go ahead and put the devil on
[2:04:51] notice again he ain't welcome here
[2:04:57] every sinner is welcome because there's
[2:04:58] one that can change you just like he did
[2:05:00] me but I'll put him on notice the devil
[2:05:02] ain't welcome
[2:05:05] when the devil gets upon the Sheep you
[2:05:07] ain't welcome these are God's sheep and
[2:05:10] God's put their heart within me for his
[2:05:11] sheep for his children you ain't welcome
[2:05:13] here
[2:05:14] you ain't welcome we ain't giving you
[2:05:16] any room we're not giving you any place

[2:05:20] here to call you out

[2:06:33] can come and hit you with depression he
[2:06:36] can come and try to hit you with anxiety
[2:06:38] that don't mean you're not a Christian

[2:06:43] privileges that ain't to shame you

[2:11:59] this moment
[2:12:01] lives Lord that can really fully repent
[2:12:04] not just be sorry for a condition
[2:12:06] they're in but really really look at you
[2:12:10] and say Lord forgive me of my sin
[2:12:14] I Lay My Life down lord
[2:12:16] and Lord my strength is nothing I can't
[2:12:19] do it Lord
[2:12:21] my power is nothing I can't do it Lord
[2:12:24] I can't do it Lord I've tried to fill my
[2:12:28] life with devotionals or this and that I
[2:12:30] can't do it I still find I'm lacking I'm
[2:12:33] empty
[2:12:34] I need you Lord
[2:12:36] God May there not be
[2:12:39] we dismiss every Spirit of pride
[2:12:44] God want to hold any life back may they
[2:12:46] Lord just move right into your presence
[2:12:50] Lord of life that Lord that can really
[2:12:52] as a son and daughter of God look in
[2:12:54] their life and say you know what
[2:12:57] I'm not where I used to be
[2:13:00] I've gotten cold
[2:13:02] I'm letting little things move into my
[2:13:05] life
[2:13:06] and what's happening is the more I let
[2:13:08] things like that move in it's crowding
[2:13:10] out Jesus
[2:13:13] it's got to where that Jesus is not the
[2:13:15] priority in my life
[2:13:17] I don't make the same sacrifices the
[2:13:20] same effort that I used to make
[2:13:23] instead I find myself making excuses
[2:13:26] well he ain't here to shame you but I'm
[2:13:28] telling you how that you can look and
[2:13:31] say God
[2:13:32] you're a restorer Lord
[2:13:35] I'm asking you to restore the joy
[2:13:38] of thy salvation in my life
[2:13:42] like they looked in the Book of Joel
[2:13:44] they did not have any drink offering or
[2:13:46] any meat offering the vine and the and
[2:13:49] the fields were all bare they had
[2:13:50] nothing to bring to the house of God
[2:13:52] they had no joy
[2:13:56] the reason is is they had become
[2:13:58] neglectful little by little it don't
[2:14:01] start out real big it starts out little
[2:14:03] by little by little by little by little
[2:14:05] by little by little
[2:14:06] the same way that God builds himself in
[2:14:08] your life little by little by little
[2:14:10] Satan takes away little by little by
[2:14:12] little by little why is he doing that so
[2:14:14] he can go unnoticed
[2:14:19] but right now in his presence
[2:14:21] the restore
[2:14:24] is in the building
[2:14:27] one to restore you
[2:14:30] one that's here
[2:14:32] that you can say Lord
[2:14:35] let me just move out
[2:14:39] all of the things that's accumulated in
[2:14:41] my life things that I've allowed
[2:14:44] because you find once you start giving
[2:14:45] room to something there's always
[2:14:47] something more you've got to lay in
[2:14:49] there it's just what it is is we're
[2:14:51] actually replacing the
[2:14:53] what you really need
[2:14:56] you know how they tell us Medical
[2:14:58] Science and things they can say a person
[2:15:00] will drink pop and everything else but
[2:15:01] what you really need is water
[2:15:04] all those other things they do not
[2:15:06] satisfy your thirst
[2:15:09] this is why you feel empty look what
[2:15:11] Satan wants to do to you
[2:15:13] he wants to do that to where then you
[2:15:15] feel so condemned
[2:15:17] to where you don't even feel like you
[2:15:19] can stand in the presence of God I say
[2:15:21] right now why don't you take the sight
[2:15:23] of the Lord right now
[2:15:25] just say Lord Jesus you're a restorer
[2:15:28] Lord I've drifted but I want to come
[2:15:31] right back in Lord to your presence
[2:15:33] I want to come back into that fervancy
[2:15:35] Lord there's some things that I know
[2:15:37] I've got to clear out and set aside but
[2:15:39] I want to be fervent
[2:15:42] I want to make the rapture
[2:15:45] I don't want to live a life that's
[2:15:47] tribulation bound I want to live a life
[2:15:49] that's rapturing
[2:15:53] Grant it Lord Jesus help us Lord
[2:15:58] granted Lord for those that Lord are
[2:16:00] suffering in their body
[2:16:01] maybe they're suffering Lord they've
[2:16:03] suffered in their mind but right here
[2:16:04] this is the day this is the moment of
[2:16:06] Liberty Lord
[2:16:08] father where the spirit we're Satan
[2:16:12] is Cast Away
[2:16:15] or they can rise
[2:16:17] rise
[2:16:19] in that Liberty Lord
[2:16:21] because we're the spirit of the Lord
[2:16:23] there is Liberty
[2:16:25] Lord God you don't condemn us you don't
[2:16:27] shame us
[2:16:28] but you come Lord to manifest yourself
[2:16:32] through our life how many throughout
[2:16:34] this building Lord Jesus I think
[2:16:36] you know Lord I've done it many times
[2:16:38] when somebody sometimes the Lord has
[2:16:40] come maybe it's been a situation on the
[2:16:42] job they can speak to me Lord and I know
[2:16:44] that God that you have given counsel and
[2:16:46] wisdom right through this channel but
