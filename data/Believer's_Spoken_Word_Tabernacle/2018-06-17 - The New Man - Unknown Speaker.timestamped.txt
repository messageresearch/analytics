[32:58] love the Lord this morning sure is good
[33:02] to be in the house of the Lord we feel
[33:06] like we're already in August
[33:08] these temperatures I'll tell you the way
[33:10] they are you know but certainly good to
[33:14] be a Christian just say to each and
[33:19] every one of you especially to our
[33:21] fathers to stay god bless you richly
[33:23] amen
[33:24] just what a what a real privilege it is
[33:27] and just so thankful you know when we
[33:30] come into these times that how God by
[33:33] His grace has given to us the influence
[33:36] that's needed in this hour that we might
[33:39] truly be real representatives of him you
[33:43] know you think of it in the scripture
[33:44] there are so many so many different
[33:47] principles that are laid out in the
[33:48] scripture
[33:49] there's many principles that even this
[33:51] nation itself it's still it's run by
[33:54] many principles they get from the
[33:56] scriptures and yet they don't know him
[33:59] and I don't say that with any slight but
[34:02] what I'm saying is is what I've said
[34:04] many times times that I've set and
[34:06] counseled with people that don't even
[34:08] come here to this assembly they don't go
[34:10] anywhere but they've come and they've
[34:11] set and they've asked that I would
[34:13] counsel them and the things that I would
[34:15] mention to him was I said you know you
[34:16] can follow these principles right here
[34:18] in the word and they'll work for you but
[34:21] how much greater it is if you get he who
[34:24] is the principle man I said he he's the
[34:28] only one that can really make these
[34:30] seeds flourish in your life and that's
[34:33] the truth and we so we thank God for
[34:35] that because there's things that we can
[34:37] look at and we thank God for each and
[34:39] every one the influences that the Lord
[34:41] has brought into our lives that's been
[34:43] godly and we thank God for the influence
[34:45] of the Holy Spirit that has changed us
[34:48] and continues to change us amen don't
[34:51] you love him this morning
[34:52] amen well let's look into the word here
[34:56] and may God bless you thank you
[34:58] musicians want to look here in Luke
[35:06] chapter 5 this morning if the Lord will
[35:09] help us
[35:33] we'll begin at verse 36 and if if we
[35:36] could let's just have a word of Prayer
[35:37] first and then we'll we'll read the
[35:39] scriptures together
[35:41] Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we are just
[35:46] so thankful Lord you truly the Lord have
[35:50] made it real to us or that you are our
[35:53] Father and we are your sons and
[35:56] daughters Lord Lord I think of how that
[36:00] your prophet and made mention of this in
[36:02] the message Salome
[36:03] he said you're proving this to us
[36:07] because you have and are changing us
[36:11] from the things of the world to love you
[36:15] Lord God we see that change that has
[36:18] taken place and we in our hearts Lord
[36:22] that transforming power working in our
[36:25] lives Lord and father we just pray this
[36:28] morning that oh god may we be further
[36:32] changed Lord oh God from glory unto
[36:37] glory you you know Lord what we have
[36:40] need of Lord you know the needs in our
[36:43] lives Lord and father we just ask that
[36:46] you Lord would help us to be sensitive
[36:49] Lord because you have every answer Lord
[36:52] you're the answer to all of life's
[36:54] questions in every situation so lord
[36:57] help us to be steel Lord and just to be
[37:01] able to hear from you lord what it is
[37:04] that we need to hear father may you move
[37:06] among us in a real special way this
[37:08] morning Lord may our hearts be warmed
[37:11] Lord in your presence we pray and father
[37:13] we would ask all of these things for
[37:16] your glory in the name of Jesus Christ
[37:18] amen amen
[37:21] Luke chapter 5 verse 36
[37:26] and he spake also a parable unto them no
[37:30] man putteth a piece of new garment upon
[37:34] an old if otherwise then both the new
[37:38] maketh Arendt and the piece that was
[37:42] taken out of the new agree if not with
[37:46] the old it realized as the Lord Jesus is
[37:50] dealing with this here it's not so much
[37:53] that it is that the cloth itself or
[37:56] maybe the coloration would be different
[37:58] but that the new itself when it would be
[38:00] put into the old when it would go
[38:03] through all the other processes the
[38:05] washings and everything else it itself
[38:08] would not mesh and agree and hold the
[38:11] same qualities that would actually be
[38:14] present in the other garment and most of
[38:17] you know this if you've ever tried to
[38:19] somehow maybe your favorite shirt or
[38:21] whatever it is you've tried to somehow
[38:23] arrange things to where that you can get
[38:25] this repaired or maybe it's a piece of
[38:27] carpet or whatever more you know it just
[38:29] never really meshes just right the
[38:31] fibers just aren't right so here this is
[38:35] where the Lord Jesus is letting us know
[38:37] that it's not just putting something on
[38:40] the old because he won't agree verse 37
[38:44] and no man putteth new wine into old
[38:50] bottles so he's taking the same thought
[38:52] else the new wine will burst the bottles
[38:56] and be spilled and the bottles shall
[39:01] perish so God's not interested in
[39:04] blowing things up he's interested in
[39:06] saving you with me he never came to blow
[39:11] things up he came to save but new wine
[39:16] must be put into new bottles and both
[39:21] are preserved no man also having drunk
[39:26] old wine straightway desireth knew for
[39:28] he saith the old is better may God bless
[39:32] you bless the reading was worse or being
[39:33] seated
[39:35] I'd like to speak to you this morning on
[39:38] the new man the new man this parable we
[39:45] we see that it has been recorded in each
[39:50] one of the Gospels except that of John
[39:53] and we we look at it at how that the
[39:57] Lord Jesus would speak of this and the
[39:59] people within that time those he was
[40:02] speaking to would have an understanding
[40:04] to what he was saying we sometimes look
[40:08] in our language of how things are
[40:09] recorded or documented and we look into
[40:13] it and it would be kind of hard if we
[40:14] left the term bottles and just left it
[40:18] in that terminology because you would
[40:20] look at it well if I put something in a
[40:22] bottle the bottle itself no matter if
[40:24] the bottle is old or new the bottle will
[40:26] be able to hold the contents but this is
[40:30] not speaking of a bottle glass bottle
[40:32] that we would look at but it is actually
[40:34] speaking of wine skins and wine skins
[40:37] were that which is made out of leather
[40:39] which leather meaning that of animal
[40:42] hide so when we think of it that it's
[40:46] hides of an animal typically it was
[40:48] animals that were either a goat or
[40:51] either a sheep and when you look at it
[40:54] that many times within this it was just
[40:56] looking at many different pictures of it
[40:58] it was it was many times left within the
[41:01] shape you could actually see the actual
[41:03] form of the animal hide itself because
[41:07] the hide being taken off the animal it
[41:09] no longer had all the contents on the
[41:11] inside the only thing that was needed or
[41:14] wanted was that hide and so they would
[41:17] take that hide they would bring it down
[41:18] from the neck and you know up from a
[41:20] certain part on all the legs and they
[41:23] would actually close off certain parts
[41:25] and almost all of these openings they
[41:27] would close them off and that would it
[41:29] would just look like it here it is it's
[41:31] just hanging upside down and what it
[41:33] looks like it looks like you could see
[41:35] you'd say hey what kind of animal is
[41:38] that hanging there well it was a sheep
[41:41] it was a goat it was a living animal at
[41:44] one time because you're able to identify
[41:46] the
[41:47] or that you still can see but yet
[41:50] everything that is there within that has
[41:53] been completely removed but now that
[41:55] wine has been put in place that the wine
[41:57] itself the juice that they freshly taken
[42:01] that the that the wine itself
[42:02] unfermented might begin to ferment
[42:06] inside of that wine or inside of the the
[42:08] animal skins itself and I look at this
[42:11] in the terms of the scriptures here in
[42:14] Ezekiel 36 I'm just going to go through
[42:16] a few scriptures here in the beginning
[42:17] and you see how that God Himself would
[42:20] speak to Israel and we know that it
[42:23] prophetically it speaks to you and I as
[42:24] well in verse 24 of Ezekiel 36 God said
[42:28] for I will take you from among the
[42:31] heathen and gather you out of all
[42:33] countries and will bring you into your
[42:34] own land then will I sprinkle clean
[42:37] water upon you and ye shall be clean
[42:40] from all your filthiness and from all
[42:43] your idols will I cleanse you a new
[42:46] heart also will I give you and a new
[42:49] spirit will I put within you and I will
[42:54] take away the stony heart out of your
[42:56] flesh and I will give you and heart of
[42:59] flesh and I will put my spirit within
[43:02] you and cause you to walk in my statutes
[43:06] and ye shall keep my judgments and do
[43:10] them now there's honor in in this whole
[43:13] reading of what we've just looked at
[43:15] there's not one thing within there that
[43:18] has spoken about you or me doing
[43:21] anything but remember in order for God
[43:24] to do this this is what he himself I
[43:27] will take away the stony heart I will
[43:31] give you a heart of flesh and I will
[43:34] give you a new spirit and then I will
[43:36] put my spirit within you you know all of
[43:39] this in order for this to take place
[43:41] remember God will never he does not
[43:44] force himself upon anyone so in order
[43:48] for this I will it requires that God
[43:51] moving on our life and that you and I
[43:54] are yielding to this that his work might
[43:57] be done it comes
[43:59] to it we in our lives we truly are his
[44:02] workmanship and this is where that even
[44:04] where God would would call a person and
[44:07] you know to think of how that you know
[44:09] many of us can remember it when God
[44:11] first dealt with your heart and and here
[44:14] are a heart in her life the way it was
[44:16] and the Spirit of God would call to us
[44:18] and you find quickly you repent of your
[44:21] sins and as you repent of your sins and
[44:23] you accept the Lord Jesus as your Savior
[44:25] you actually feel a release or a lifting
[44:29] because he already is the sin bearer
[44:33] he's already taken away the sins of the
[44:36] world he paid the price for that so you
[44:38] feel that release but yet the individual
[44:41] can still go around and and they still
[44:43] have all the desires in their life but
[44:45] then God also has said how we'll give
[44:48] you a new heart so there it meant there
[44:51] begins to be a changing of the mind
[44:53] itself setting the mind in order of
[44:56] holiness there's things that thoughts
[44:58] and things that begin to change within
[45:00] your life as God Himself is cleansing
[45:03] that heart and that life it's him doing
[45:06] the work that he himself might come in
[45:09] and then dwell in the middle or in the
[45:12] midst of our life and when that comes
[45:15] his spirit is placed within us then
[45:18] that's where that new birth that changes
[45:20] on the inside and he's living and
[45:23] dwelling behind his veil right there in
[45:27] the midst of our life and through that
[45:29] then there is his life that's permeating
[45:32] and moving out through the other courts
[45:34] of our life it's a great change because
[45:37] the things that you can look at in your
[45:39] life that I'm sure we can fellowship on
[45:42] this morning that there is no way that
[45:44] you could be able to do and live the way
[45:47] that you live if not for the mercy of
[45:50] Almighty God and God brought a change
[45:53] within your life listen friends our best
[45:55] efforts and our best days will never cut
[45:58] it but it has to be a change and God by
[46:02] His change coming on the inside then
[46:04] once he gets on the inside then as he
[46:07] continues to move
[46:08] removing his life all the way through
[46:11] you and I it's a continual dying can you
[46:15] say you man so this is his workmanship I
[46:18] will put my spirit within you in Titus
[46:22] 3:5 not by works of righteousness which
[46:24] we have done but according to His mercy
[46:27] he saved us by the washing of
[46:31] regeneration and renewing of the Holy
[46:34] Ghost it's God releasing upon the seed
[46:39] the what is needed in the hour in order
[46:43] to bring the seeds of God to a complete
[46:46] birth and it's a it's a renewing of the
[46:49] Holy Ghost it's a washing of
[46:51] regeneration where the holy spirit
[46:54] through the word is going to bring about
[46:56] that transformation within the heart and
[46:59] within the life look how he puts it here
[47:01] in Romans 12:1 I beseech you therefore
[47:04] brethren by the mercies of God that ye
[47:07] present your bodies a living sacrifice
[47:11] holy acceptable unto God which is your
[47:15] reasonable service and be not conformed
[47:18] to this world but be transformed by the
[47:22] renewing of your mind that you may prove
[47:26] what is that good and acceptable and
[47:29] perfect will of God
[47:31] but then puts it like this in God's
[47:34] power to transform
[47:35] he said he longs to have fellowship with
[47:38] you he is longing for you he wants to
[47:42] transform you by the renewing of your
[47:44] mind not to the church or to the
[47:47] denomination but to his word which you
[47:51] are a part if that desire is in you you
[47:55] see the desire is not something that is
[47:58] given to us as far when we come to that
[48:02] around the word but it's a desire that
[48:05] is always there within us that nothing
[48:08] else could satisfy this is why the
[48:11] Prophet tells us and the message
[48:13] identification he sold that desire
[48:16] within you and he himself made a way
[48:19] that that desire
[48:21] come to a fulfillment all the way
[48:23] through this building there are a lot of
[48:25] things that perhaps some of you are
[48:26] desiring to do maybe desiring to do
[48:29] certain things around your house
[48:30] desiring to you know little things
[48:33] within the natural but yet you know that
[48:35] just desiring to do it and it being done
[48:38] is really two different things but what
[48:41] God Himself did not just leave you and I
[48:43] listen to me now he did not just leave
[48:46] you and I with just a desire to be a
[48:48] Christian but that desire has come into
[48:51] a full reality within our heart by a new
[48:54] birth to where that it is the very
[48:57] spirit of righteousness that's working
[49:00] on the inside and this is why the
[49:02] scripture can declare whosoever is born
[49:05] of God cannot commit sin because the
[49:10] seed of God remaineth in him you
[49:13] understand what the word commit means it
[49:16] means to be a practitioner you and one
[49:19] time lived in those conditions but you
[49:24] no longer live there there is you you
[49:28] are you have changed there's been a
[49:31] transformation that has taken place
[49:38] blessed are they that do hunger and
[49:40] thirst for righteousness for they shall
[49:44] be filled for the RAM picks it up in
[49:49] another place and God's power to
[49:51] transform and it's in prayers that all
[49:54] God transform us today by your power by
[49:59] the renewing of our mind to turn from
[50:02] the meager elements of this world now
[50:05] unto the Word of God and may we be
[50:08] renewed by the transforming power of God
[50:13] upon the seed that's in our heart so the
[50:19] transforming power it's come from God
[50:23] that renewing of the Holy Ghost that
[50:25] washing of regeneration that is the
[50:28] inspiration the water that is poured out
[50:32] that what is need
[50:34] in order to release the germ that's on
[50:38] or the inside of that seed and bring it
[50:41] to life so pour out of that transforming
[50:44] power upon the seed that's in our heart
[50:48] you see God's the whole the whole thrust
[50:51] of redemption itself is God coming down
[50:55] to claim what belongs to him
[50:59] and this redemption of the soul then it
[51:05] is a deposit and a down payment that
[51:08] this body shall also be redeemed one day
[51:14] we're going to put off this thing
[51:17] one day we'll never walk around with
[51:20] that that that's human spirit that we've
[51:22] had there will no longer walk we will be
[51:25] there within a three-room house but
[51:26] we'll never be there in that human
[51:29] spirit with all of those memories and
[51:31] everything else of all your failures and
[51:34] ever you'll never be there and the body
[51:36] itself you're not just going to get a
[51:38] new body I told you the other day
[51:40] you need more than just a young body I
[51:42] need more than just a young body
[51:44] I need the buttons changed in this body
[51:47] there is a buttons that came with this
[51:50] body because of the first birth and them
[51:53] buttons are still there are you with me
[51:56] they're still there this body is sins is
[52:00] that were the Jews it was it was
[52:02] strictly written that you cannot take of
[52:06] an old hide and put new wine in it they
[52:09] they strictly wrote it because they're
[52:12] the old hides could not contain they
[52:16] were not flexible they could not
[52:18] actually be able to contain what would
[52:21] take place when that new wine was put on
[52:24] the inside so this when Jesus is
[52:26] speaking this they're aware of what he's
[52:29] talking about but what he's calling them
[52:31] to is there's got to be a transformation
[52:34] there's got to be a change now notice
[52:37] how he goes on to say here but new wine
[52:40] must be put into new bottles and both
[52:44] are preserved now think about this
[52:48] when we look at it of how that in midst
[52:52] of it held that when you think of how
[52:53] that the manor itself would fall within
[52:56] the wilderness at that Manor being a
[52:59] type of the Holy Ghost they were sent
[53:02] together out and go gather that manner
[53:05] and remember the manor itself by the
[53:08] time of the evening that manna would
[53:11] already have maggots in it now when you
[53:14] look at it there's nothing wrong with
[53:16] the Holy Ghost nothing wrong at all
[53:19] but what manna fell on the first day the
[53:23] priests that were were commanded by God
[53:26] to go out and to take an Omer full of
[53:29] that original manner now this is not
[53:32] something that was a original manner
[53:34] that had to be replenished but it was
[53:36] the original outpouring of that manner
[53:39] and they were to take that Omer and they
[53:41] were to take the omer of manna and put
[53:44] it into the holiest of holies you know
[53:48] that manner inside the holiest of Holies
[53:50] it never got maggots in it it never
[53:53] contaminated that experience was just as
[53:57] fresh and true and genuine it didn't
[54:00] matter how long and with that experience
[54:02] was the same you see it matters where
[54:05] the Holy Ghost falls so when we talk
[54:09] about the Holy Ghost and we recognize
[54:11] that's why the word when God sent a word
[54:14] in this hour it's a word that would come
[54:17] that would release the Holy Spirit back
[54:19] into the Church of the Living God that
[54:22] Christ himself might have preeminence
[54:24] and lead the people of God and bring you
[54:27] and I into a real true birth according
[54:30] to the part that's allotted to us within
[54:33] the word to be fulfilled in this hour it
[54:35] is the Holy Spirit doing the work and it
[54:39] takes the power of the moisture of the
[54:42] Holy Ghost coming through the word to
[54:45] bring about a change because remember
[54:47] it's not a man's idea when God sends a
[54:50] messenger on the scene a messenger is
[54:53] not coming with his own thoughts or his
[54:55] own ideas he is a star in the right hand
[54:59] of God and he's
[55:00] electing that same life of the true
[55:03] atonement there's no variation in it
[55:05] it's being reflected right down into the
[55:08] Church of the Living God the age and
[55:11] that life that's there is to capture the
[55:14] elect of God within that hour you
[55:17] believe that the holy spirit is sent for
[55:20] the see that's the whole the whole part
[55:23] of how that the manna itself so when you
[55:25] look at this that the Spirit of God
[55:28] moving down and moving down to where
[55:31] that it would fall into new bottles new
[55:36] wineskins so that both are preserved
[55:39] remember as I said moments ago God's not
[55:42] interested in bringing ruin to a
[55:44] person's life that in God's that is
[55:48] that's a God's Way you see let me say it
[55:51] like this God he did we understand he
[55:55] doesn't force himself upon anybody and I
[55:59] don't believe that we also force
[56:02] ourselves upon anybody if there's people
[56:04] out there in your workplace your family
[56:06] or whatever more listen to me don't try
[56:08] to force what understanding that God has
[56:11] given to you first of all like we looked
[56:13] at here on Thursday night your first of
[56:15] all a billboard and the Prophet clearly
[56:19] said we're not salesmen you know what I
[56:23] mean
[56:24] I don't want to labor on that but we're
[56:26] billboard let it let a life be shown and
[56:28] wait till God opens the door let there
[56:32] be an answer I believe that was on my
[56:33] heart but we're to move by the unction
[56:36] of the Holy Ghost don't you allow Satan
[56:37] to put guilt upon you you can operate by
[56:41] guilt and end up bring an offense it's
[56:45] operated by the love of God and grace
[56:47] then is provided for the here so then
[56:51] when we're looking at it it's God's
[56:53] desire that within notice that the new
[56:56] wine and the new bottles that both of
[56:59] them are preserved to think of it that
[57:01] when that new wine is poured out when
[57:04] there are new bottles that are set aside
[57:05] for it that wine is actually preserved
[57:09] and the bottle is preserved whereas if
[57:12] it was old bottles and you put new
[57:14] while in there those skins have lost the
[57:17] oil they they have served their purpose
[57:19] and they're brittle they cannot be
[57:21] flexible that cannot be stretched they
[57:24] cannot be moved but that's why it must
[57:26] be new bottles let me tell you something
[57:30] if God brings forth new wine then God is
[57:33] the one who knows there is going to be
[57:35] new bottles because he's ordained new
[57:38] bottles to receive new one hallelujah he
[57:43] will not his word will not return back
[57:45] to him void so to preserve this is to
[57:49] preserve a thing from perishing or being
[57:52] lost and this is how that God God keeps
[57:56] his word God keeps his word he keeps it
[58:00] in her eyes the Prophet put it just like
[58:01] this his rights are protected on earth
[58:04] not my copyrights his rights are
[58:07] protected by Holy Ghost filled people
[58:10] there are lives that he has changed and
[58:13] they look upon that word and they're
[58:16] standing there in that word and said
[58:17] this is what God has said this is God's
[58:20] word he's still the same God in this
[58:22] generation and they stand upon that work
[58:25] that is horns on the lamb his protection
[58:29] of his rights on earth don't you want to
[58:32] be that aren't you glad you are that to
[58:35] be a vassal that he can move through and
[58:38] move upon our lives preserve that we
[58:41] would be preserved to think of it that
[58:43] when God has done this work you can no
[58:46] more die than God could die you are
[58:50] sealed until the day of your redemption
[58:52] you don't become unsealed you're sealed
[58:56] until the day of your redemption let's
[58:59] look at this a little bit an anointed
[59:00] ones at the end time the Prophet tells
[59:03] it like this he's talking about how they
[59:05] teach a historical God and trying to
[59:07] live in the past and well Wesley said
[59:09] so-and-so or so-and-so said so-and-so
[59:11] you're refusing the promised word of the
[59:15] day the manna that's clearly identified
[59:19] of the day they try to put their old
[59:21] Lutheran Baptist Pentecostal ones in our
[59:26] new bottles it don't work and our new
[59:30] wine in their old bottles won't work so
[59:35] let the old wine for old bottles but
[59:38] there's new wine for new bottles if they
[59:43] try to put this new wine in the
[59:44] nomination their folly is made manifest
[59:48] they can't do it it blows her up now
[59:51] what'd you think of this just for a
[59:53] moment remember God's desire is not just
[59:57] that there would be demonstrations but
[59:59] his desire would be a living action of
[1:00:03] his life within us how much you think of
[1:00:05] this I could speak I could pull out a
[1:00:07] lot of different things and and speak of
[1:00:09] this and say this will say that and it
[1:00:11] would demonstrate that I am a son of of
[1:00:14] James browning it would demonstrate that
[1:00:16] but God doesn't want demonstrations as
[1:00:19] far as that's the only thing that I live
[1:00:21] by
[1:00:21] God wants there to be a living action in
[1:00:25] our lives of the person of Jesus Christ
[1:00:27] this is why the Prophet himself was
[1:00:30] accused of not preaching the Holy Ghost
[1:00:33] and in Satan's Eden he said I understand
[1:00:35] there's people right around the
[1:00:37] tabernacle that has said why don't
[1:00:39] brother ban a preach on the Holy Ghost
[1:00:40] he said here it is it's the person of
[1:00:43] Christ within you quickened to every
[1:00:46] word for the age he said don't watch so
[1:00:49] much on demonstrations but watch the
[1:00:51] action of the person inside of you
[1:00:56] glory be to God if I'm going and
[1:00:59] somebody's kidnapped don't just send me
[1:01:01] and show me garments of that person if
[1:01:03] I've got to pay a ransom I don't want to
[1:01:06] just see garments of it oh I know he
[1:01:08] wears that shirt I know she does this
[1:01:10] now I want to see the person when I see
[1:01:14] the person I know it's still good rule
[1:01:18] repeater God Oh hallelujah
[1:01:21] so to think of how that God has given
[1:01:24] the strength of what has been needed for
[1:01:27] each day and for each hour we thank God
[1:01:29] for that thank God for the outpouring of
[1:01:31] the Holy Spirit down through the ages
[1:01:33] but remembering that even within that
[1:01:36] word that that God would desire that the
[1:01:39] people
[1:01:39] would walk on to think of how that God
[1:01:41] in every generation
[1:01:43] he's never opened his word inside of an
[1:01:47] organization another very simple but the
[1:01:50] reality is God does not open his word
[1:01:53] inside of an organization and you
[1:01:55] realize friends that where does
[1:01:57] organization stem from it stems from the
[1:02:00] very mind a mind of man it stems from
[1:02:04] carnal nature Luther did not start the
[1:02:08] lutheran denomination Wesley did not
[1:02:11] start the Methodist the right
[1:02:14] they were fallen angels who came behind
[1:02:16] that and then they themselves begin to
[1:02:19] move upon that but yet those who are
[1:02:22] danger life they move on in that life
[1:02:25] this goes the same way God will not move
[1:02:28] in organizational thinking that I'm
[1:02:31] dissing friends this is where it
[1:02:33] pertains to you and me God will not move
[1:02:35] if our minds gets in any way to
[1:02:38] organizational thinking oh I tell you I
[1:02:40] desire with all my heart God let it be a
[1:02:43] renewing Lord God I don't trust myself
[1:02:46] and if you trust yourself you're in bad
[1:02:49] trouble
[1:02:50] we need a renewing of the Holy Ghost
[1:02:53] no wonder the prophets said we've been
[1:02:55] saved we've been filled with the Holy
[1:02:57] Ghost now he said we need the mind of
[1:03:00] Christ to move in our renewing of our
[1:03:03] minds we need that Oh glory be to God
[1:03:08] what does it take to make a Christian
[1:03:11] life what's up brother BAM says this
[1:03:13] here may every heart he said go out of
[1:03:16] here singing with the mainspring of
[1:03:19] their soul the Holy Spirit and the
[1:03:21] pulsations of their heart as it beats
[1:03:23] all may their souls jump and spring and
[1:03:28] stretch to the Word of God as new
[1:03:32] bottles with new wine with a new hope
[1:03:34] with a new faith with a new spirit and
[1:03:37] God's Spirit in the middle of it the
[1:03:40] life pushing on them
[1:03:43] it's wonderful to jump
[1:03:46] but it's wonderful to shout but there's
[1:03:51] also times we need to stretch oh my is
[1:03:56] wonderful when it's it's going down oh
[1:03:59] it was sweet in my mouth that it gets
[1:04:03] down in the belly it's time to stretch
[1:04:05] this is where it comes to live it out in
[1:04:08] the word time to stretch oh my in the
[1:04:13] impersonation of Christianity the
[1:04:15] Prophet said think of it like this he
[1:04:17] said what he said I see what Jesus meant
[1:04:20] there if you put new wine unfermented
[1:04:23] one into a bottle like that and that new
[1:04:27] wine had life in it and it went to
[1:04:30] working and fermenting it would burst
[1:04:36] when they put that wine it's not for a
[1:04:39] minute it's freshly squeezed juice but
[1:04:45] when it gets inside of the animal hide
[1:04:47] the reason it needs new bottles is
[1:04:50] because there is a need for flexibility
[1:04:53] there's a need for stretching because
[1:04:55] what is taking place on the inside of
[1:04:58] that hide there is a change that's
[1:05:01] taking place what are that grape juice
[1:05:03] that it was placed within there
[1:05:05] freshly squeezed from the fruit of the
[1:05:08] vine oh my it's freshly squeezed and as
[1:05:11] it moves in there there is a
[1:05:12] transformation that is taking place to
[1:05:15] where that grape juice on the inside
[1:05:17] actually begins to become fermented and
[1:05:21] it actually moves within its potency and
[1:05:24] it's proof it don't get weaker it gets
[1:05:27] stronger you realize that the real holy
[1:05:30] spirit within our life it doesn't get
[1:05:32] weaker it gets stronger the Prophet
[1:05:35] tells us like this and the message
[1:05:36] Messiah he said when the holy ghost has
[1:05:39] come in he comes in like a little white
[1:05:42] button he said like a little white ray
[1:05:44] of light and it begins to grow in our
[1:05:47] life and begins to push out all these
[1:05:50] other things it's growing within us as
[1:05:54] it's growing within us how does it grow
[1:05:57] it's got to be a
[1:05:58] building of our lives on the inside now
[1:06:01] think of this how that God himself
[1:06:03] remember the life moving upon the sea
[1:06:06] God's desire is to dwell within the
[1:06:09] human heart this is God's desire this is
[1:06:12] where God sets up his residency he never
[1:06:14] dwelt in the outer Court he never dwelt
[1:06:17] within the holy place he dwelled in the
[1:06:20] holiest of Holies where he came down and
[1:06:23] where he told Moses I will meet you in
[1:06:25] there
[1:06:25] I will commune with you and there it was
[1:06:28] there that God the Shekinah glory would
[1:06:30] take up his residency in the innermost
[1:06:33] part and that is the same way that he
[1:06:36] does within you and I so this new bottle
[1:06:38] this new skin is not a changing of this
[1:06:41] skin but God himself knows the the real
[1:06:45] reality of this skin I just got to get
[1:06:48] to the inside and when I bring about the
[1:06:50] change on the inside to wear that I take
[1:06:53] out a stony heart and I put in a new
[1:06:56] heart then I myself can move on in the
[1:06:59] inside and be able to live out my life
[1:07:03] from within them and eventually from
[1:07:07] with inside this new wineskin on the
[1:07:10] inside I'll eventually get a new skin
[1:07:13] out here glory be to God so we become
[1:07:20] flexible because oil is still in the
[1:07:23] skin now look at this in in Ephesians
[1:07:26] chapter 2 verse 14 the scripture says
[1:07:29] for he is our peace who hath made both
[1:07:33] one and has broken down the middle wall
[1:07:36] of partition between us having abolished
[1:07:40] in his flesh the enmity even the law of
[1:07:43] Commandments contained in ordinances for
[1:07:46] to make in himself of twain one new man
[1:07:51] so making peace that he might reconcile
[1:07:55] both unto God in one body by the cross
[1:07:57] having slain the enmity thereby so the
[1:08:02] price was already paid as we've been
[1:08:04] looking at that price was paid he died
[1:08:07] just simply put it how the prophet put
[1:08:09] it he said he died
[1:08:10] that you and I might die he died but you
[1:08:15] and I might die if that had not been a
[1:08:17] surrendering and a death there's no way
[1:08:19] that you and I could die but because he
[1:08:24] died it makes way through the life
[1:08:27] through the water that is there that
[1:08:30] this ransom this price has been paid and
[1:08:33] now the Holy Ghost can flow in renewing
[1:08:37] and bringing about the change in our
[1:08:39] life to where it comes into a complete
[1:08:42] birth and I'm so glad it don't just stop
[1:08:45] there he's working in our life he's
[1:08:48] changing us from glory unto glory Oh
[1:08:52] glory
[1:08:53] we're not deceived to think that all of
[1:08:55] a sudden once we've been born again I'm
[1:08:57] all of a sudden a fully perfect man we
[1:09:00] have been born as a child and we grow
[1:09:03] and we grow and we grow there's child
[1:09:06] training there's training I'll tell you
[1:09:08] what we're going to need training we're
[1:09:10] going to need guidance of the Holy
[1:09:11] Spirit every moment that we live here in
[1:09:14] this life we're going to need correction
[1:09:16] by the Holy Ghost because there's still
[1:09:18] two parts of us that have not been
[1:09:20] redeemed but that inside man has been
[1:09:23] redeemed and that inside man is the one
[1:09:26] who feeds on the Word of God and that
[1:09:29] inside man is the one that looks to that
[1:09:31] outside man and says shut up you're
[1:09:34] going with me no wonder Paul said I
[1:09:36] bring my body in subjection that word
[1:09:41] subjection there means to beat it black
[1:09:43] and blue glory be to God so he made one
[1:09:51] new man we've seen this he's the
[1:09:54] beginning of this new creation and verse
[1:09:58] 17 came and preached peace to you which
[1:10:01] were afar off and to them that were not
[1:10:03] for through him we both have access by
[1:10:06] one spirit unto the Father now therefore
[1:10:09] ye are no more strangers and foreigners
[1:10:12] but fellow-citizens with the Saints and
[1:10:15] of the household of God don't you think
[1:10:18] God for that
[1:10:19] think of how Ruth must have felt when
[1:10:21] she came into the land she's watching
[1:10:23] everything that
[1:10:24] taking place she's made a decision to
[1:10:26] come but oh how the Holy Spirit begins
[1:10:30] to woo and move in her life and then
[1:10:33] when there is a uniting with Boaz oh ma
[1:10:35] she's no longer a stranger but now she
[1:10:37] is a fellow citizen she was one without
[1:10:40] the covenants now she is in the Covenant
[1:10:42] by a real true spiritual marriage think
[1:10:45] about Rahab after the walls have fallen
[1:10:48] down and here she is there is nobody to
[1:10:50] testify against her there is absolutely
[1:10:52] no witnesses to say been there in the
[1:10:55] wind when they are standing up that day
[1:10:57] - Miriam if there is any calls why these
[1:10:59] two should not be joined in matrimony
[1:11:01] please let him speak at this time but
[1:11:04] all the voices that was against her had
[1:11:07] been silenced hey man the shout had
[1:11:12] brought down the walls and it's silenced
[1:11:15] all the voices that was against her
[1:11:17] there was no one there
[1:11:19] to accuse her and in the midst of that
[1:11:21] time here she is through and by her
[1:11:24] union with Salman she's brought into
[1:11:27] citizenship through and by the spiritual
[1:11:29] ordained channels of marriage you also
[1:11:34] seen how Jezebel tried to enter in
[1:11:36] Jezebel did not enter in through the
[1:11:38] right spiritual channels it looked as
[1:11:40] though it was but yet it was not she and
[1:11:43] they have come together for political
[1:11:45] purposes oh ma what a what a what a
[1:11:49] detriment look at this in verse 20 you
[1:11:52] are built upon the foundation of the
[1:11:55] apostles and prophets Jesus Christ
[1:11:58] Himself being the chief Cornerstone you
[1:12:00] see this is why if a person looks at
[1:12:03] their foundation and they look at where
[1:12:05] it is within their life and then they
[1:12:07] look and say well I don't believe God
[1:12:09] does this anymore I don't believe we
[1:12:10] need this anymore I don't believe these
[1:12:12] things then you need to check what
[1:12:13] foundation are you standing on because
[1:12:16] the Holy Spirit listen to me now the
[1:12:18] Holy Spirit is a placer he will place
[1:12:22] you he's the only one that can place you
[1:12:24] in the body he's the only one that can
[1:12:27] establish you and I he's the only one
[1:12:29] that can settle us he's the only one
[1:12:31] that can really truly ground you and I
[1:12:34] you believe that the whole
[1:12:36] spirit does not produce wandering the
[1:12:38] Holy Spirit brings settled miss he is
[1:12:41] the very rest the Sabbath of God to
[1:12:44] bring rest in Christ and to bring rest
[1:12:47] and placement even in this life so to
[1:12:51] think of this here this is how God works
[1:12:53] you you see it all the way through the
[1:12:55] Old Testament I don't have time to deal
[1:12:57] with all of that but you see how that
[1:12:59] the Holy Ghost will work within this
[1:13:01] that replaces us upon the foundation you
[1:13:04] see friends this is why that that many
[1:13:07] times down through that the whole ages
[1:13:09] where spirits have wanted to come in and
[1:13:12] try to move people away from the word
[1:13:15] and where they're standing oh let me
[1:13:16] tell you something a real true messenger
[1:13:19] never ever has ever taken anybody away
[1:13:22] from the scriptures it has never taken
[1:13:25] anybody and said this doesn't need to be
[1:13:27] anymore
[1:13:27] listen man none on the contrary a
[1:13:30] messenger sent by God is one sent from
[1:13:33] God with a message and if he's got a
[1:13:36] message there's an intended audience for
[1:13:39] that message that's going to hear it and
[1:13:41] heed to it and they by listening to that
[1:13:44] word coming under submission and
[1:13:46] obedience to that word are established
[1:13:49] in Jesus Christ that's a real purpose of
[1:13:52] a message so when people say I don't
[1:13:57] believe in certain things no more
[1:13:58] eugen to check your foundation verse 21
[1:14:02] in whom all the building fitly framed
[1:14:05] together the whole building not just us
[1:14:11] Ephesus all the way on down its fitly
[1:14:16] framed together groweth unto a holy
[1:14:20] temple in the Lord in whom he also are
[1:14:24] builded together for in habitation of
[1:14:27] God through the spirit hey men look at
[1:14:31] this and he of Ephesians chapter 2 verse
[1:14:33] 10 for we are his workmanship listen all
[1:14:41] of us have thank God for the ministry
[1:14:42] ministries know know that you said under
[1:14:44] maybe a ministry that here you were in a
[1:14:46] camp somewhere one or more thank God for
[1:14:48] that ministry and how it helped you
[1:14:50] but remember it was still the Holy
[1:14:52] Spirit's not a man it's the Holy Spirit
[1:14:54] that moves it's him doing the work upon
[1:14:59] our lives we are his workmanship created
[1:15:04] in Christ Jesus unto good works my
[1:15:08] created on in Christ Jesus unto good
[1:15:12] works which God hath before ordained
[1:15:16] that we should walk in there Omaha I
[1:15:18] think of how the Prophet at the end of
[1:15:20] rising of the Sun all he says how are we
[1:15:23] going to do this how is this word going
[1:15:25] to be glorified within us he said I'll
[1:15:27] tell you how we're ordained for that
[1:15:30] word to be glorified through our lives
[1:15:32] it's us taking a hold of that word it's
[1:15:36] not by my efforts it's by my yielding
[1:15:40] not my efforts not my Aegis MMus but his
[1:15:46] presence comes to say just rest
[1:15:53] this word created it means to make
[1:15:55] habitable it's the same word that's used
[1:15:58] the linkage is used in terms of
[1:16:01] proprietorship where it's not a
[1:16:03] partnership it's a proprietorship the
[1:16:06] one who owns the business he's the
[1:16:08] stockholder of the business he's the
[1:16:10] worm that is absolutely responsible for
[1:16:12] any loss in the business he's
[1:16:14] responsible for all the gain in the
[1:16:16] business he is sole proprietor and the
[1:16:19] Holy Ghost oh my
[1:16:21] he hath created we are under the sole
[1:16:24] proprietorship of Almighty God in Christ
[1:16:27] Jesus he is responsible fooling for our
[1:16:31] lives
[1:16:32] no repeater God it's not me that's
[1:16:35] responsible he's responsible are you
[1:16:39] with me he's responsible when there's
[1:16:41] something that's needed in my life maybe
[1:16:43] it's something I need to make right
[1:16:44] maybe something you need to make right
[1:16:46] you realize he's responsible to bring
[1:16:49] about in my life to where there's
[1:16:51] awareness of it and there's also that
[1:16:53] where it's able to stretch and be able
[1:16:56] to make it right
[1:17:00] cuz this old flesh better you don't like
[1:17:02] the stretch but it ain't the flesh
[1:17:04] stretching it's a hard he put in there
[1:17:09] you know her to be to God
[1:17:11] notice this Ephesians 5:23 let's look at
[1:17:14] this a little more for the husband is
[1:17:16] the head of the wife even as Christ as
[1:17:18] the head of the church and he is the
[1:17:21] savior of the body Colossians 1:18 he is
[1:17:26] the head of the body the church so the
[1:17:30] church is his body but it's not this
[1:17:34] body his body remember Adams body that
[1:17:38] which have become out of him his
[1:17:41] attributes his gene that which God
[1:17:44] opened up the side of Adam and he took
[1:17:47] out of Adam a helpmate and when he
[1:17:49] brought her to him she's bone of my bone
[1:17:52] flesh of my flesh she shall be called
[1:17:55] woman because she was taken out of man
[1:17:59] she is the womb that he might reproduce
[1:18:03] himself in don't you realize that it is
[1:18:05] that see that cell that was ordained of
[1:18:08] God that was the womb that Christ
[1:18:11] Himself was able to bring forward and so
[1:18:15] his image on the inside amen that heart
[1:18:20] that new bottle that he could put that
[1:18:22] new wine on the inside makes you jump
[1:18:25] sometimes makes you shout sometimes and
[1:18:28] other times it gives you the ability to
[1:18:30] stretch once you're glad for that he's
[1:18:36] the head of his jeans his body his
[1:18:39] attributes 2nd Corinthians 5:16
[1:18:41] wherefore henceforth know we no man
[1:18:44] after the flesh he ain't though we have
[1:18:49] known Christ after the flesh yet now
[1:18:51] henceforth know we him no more same old
[1:18:56] temple but new creation on the inside
[1:19:03] his fourth we know no man after the
[1:19:05] flesh therefore if any man be in Christ
[1:19:11] he is a new creature old things are
[1:19:17] passed away behold all things are become
[1:19:21] new
[1:19:23] glory be to God look at this now in the
[1:19:27] message Great Commission he said when
[1:19:29] you're sick in your physical body until
[1:19:32] this body has been redeemed it's subject
[1:19:35] to sickness again but it's got to die
[1:19:37] it's got a parish so did the soul have
[1:19:40] to perish the thoughts the soul is the
[1:19:43] nature of the spirit and those thoughts
[1:19:45] and so forth in you had to perish before
[1:19:49] the new man could be born into you to
[1:19:53] make you a new creature in Christ
[1:19:57] brother Bram is dealing with with a
[1:19:59] brother here in Word made flesh India
[1:20:03] trip I know many of you have no doubt
[1:20:05] you've read this and this brother he's
[1:20:08] he's searched all over the place
[1:20:11] something has touched his heart how God
[1:20:15] touched his heart and touched his life
[1:20:17] and he searched all over the place
[1:20:19] I I want Christ I want Christ so you
[1:20:23] know he went to this camp they said you
[1:20:25] got to speak in tongues they went to
[1:20:27] this camp you got a shout you meant he
[1:20:28] went all these all these different
[1:20:30] places and finally they told him they
[1:20:32] said look you need to go see brother
[1:20:34] Branham you need to see a Prophet's what
[1:20:36] you need I'm glad we all needed to see a
[1:20:40] prophet in this generation I said we all
[1:20:42] needed to see a prophet in this
[1:20:44] generation to be able to take us in the
[1:20:46] pathway of the new birth aren't you glad
[1:20:49] and here he stands and brother BAM
[1:20:51] begins to explain it in this way he
[1:20:54] talks about he says now for you he said
[1:20:56] in your life he said you don't need a
[1:20:58] prophet he said what it was that he said
[1:21:00] that in your life he said at one time
[1:21:03] you were this certain certain way and
[1:21:04] and you used to do those certain things
[1:21:06] he said what happened to that he said
[1:21:07] well brother and me said it just changed
[1:21:10] he said it just gone from my life
[1:21:11] brother said you you you normally said
[1:21:14] these things would be done
[1:21:15] he said but something has taken place he
[1:21:18] said see brother he said you've had it
[1:21:20] the whole time he said the problem was
[1:21:22] you just wasn't straightened out
[1:21:25] in the beginning you realized this is
[1:21:28] why what I'm saying we needed a prophet
[1:21:30] within this hour listen friends there's
[1:21:32] only one true reality that'll tell you
[1:21:34] whether you've got the Holy Ghost or not
[1:21:36] the message will clearly reveal that to
[1:21:39] you and I it will make it known through
[1:21:42] our lives I know that sounds awful
[1:21:44] simple but brother Graham goes into and
[1:21:46] he puts it like this before I read you
[1:21:48] the quote he said now think of a pig now
[1:21:50] every one of us have seen pigs and and
[1:21:52] sheep and things like that and maybe you
[1:21:54] grew up on a farm or whatever if you
[1:21:56] took a pig you could scrub that pig up
[1:21:58] man you could I mean buttermilk bathe
[1:22:01] them and everything man put a bow tie on
[1:22:03] them you could do everything with that
[1:22:05] pig but that pig the first moment you
[1:22:08] lift that door be cracked that pig will
[1:22:12] be right inside there there's fresh mud
[1:22:16] out there and I'm in here you see why
[1:22:19] it's still a nature you can clean it out
[1:22:24] but it's still the nature but the first
[1:22:27] crack that pig will be gone if it'll
[1:22:29] take right back out because it's still a
[1:22:31] nature within it it can't help that it's
[1:22:34] a nature that was there but you take for
[1:22:36] example the spirit there if we could say
[1:22:39] like this of a lamb you would take out
[1:22:41] the spirit of a lamb and you put that in
[1:22:43] a pig you might see that outer form of a
[1:22:46] pig but you'll never catch that pig if
[1:22:48] it's got a lamb spirit on the inside it
[1:22:51] will not be rolling around in mud it
[1:22:54] will not be longing to go back out there
[1:22:56] you might see the form of a pig but you
[1:22:58] think something's different about this
[1:23:00] pig what's different about it if we can
[1:23:03] say we know how animals don't have souls
[1:23:04] but its spirit is different and that's
[1:23:06] the same way within a you and I as a
[1:23:10] believer there had to come a change of
[1:23:13] nature on the inside if it wasn't the
[1:23:16] change of nature
[1:23:17] it's things were just kind of looking at
[1:23:19] it and just being haled around but
[1:23:21] remember he gives us a new spirit you
[1:23:24] feel the release he gives us a new heart
[1:23:26] that's flexible that when the word
[1:23:28] is being preached that you can say a
[1:23:30] man's or the word that then he might put
[1:23:33] that new wine only inside of his life
[1:23:36] and then that life going to work and
[1:23:39] living itself out through you Oh glory
[1:23:42] be to God and this is where the Prophet
[1:23:45] said his thoughts talking to this man he
[1:23:47] said what happened his thoughts changed
[1:23:49] something does it for him as a man
[1:23:52] thinketh in his heart Christ the Creator
[1:23:56] come to him in a steel form and created
[1:24:01] truth came to him in a steel form and
[1:24:05] created his own spirit took the man's
[1:24:09] nature away to love dancing and the
[1:24:12] world and carrying on and from that time
[1:24:14] he just laid it aside and was hungry
[1:24:18] after God God was in him all the time it
[1:24:22] was God in the beginning
[1:24:23] hearing recognizing acting on the Word
[1:24:26] of God the libram says this is what's
[1:24:28] the matter today you can't get up at the
[1:24:31] altar and say well hallelujah hallelujah
[1:24:34] Lord I want the Holy Ghost hallelujah
[1:24:36] hallelujah
[1:24:37] no but brothers sister when the Holy
[1:24:40] Ghost has inspired that word to you
[1:24:43] you'll get it before you leave your seat
[1:24:45] something in you will burn up hallelujah
[1:24:53] it's got to be the inspired word even
[1:24:56] when a person when would would would be
[1:24:58] inspired to come here and to pray
[1:25:00] whether it's here or in the other
[1:25:02] meeting it must be the word that is
[1:25:04] inspired to your heart but your ass it's
[1:25:06] the word dealing with the heart it's the
[1:25:09] word dealing with the life I think
[1:25:14] sometimes we've made too many things
[1:25:15] traditions we've made things traditions
[1:25:19] we've made it in in manners of things
[1:25:21] aware well it has to be in a church and
[1:25:23] it has to be in an altar it has to be
[1:25:25] there
[1:25:25] listen friends there's many many quotes
[1:25:27] and it's understanding how the Holy
[1:25:29] Spirit would bring all of those things
[1:25:31] together the Holy Ghost in this hour
[1:25:33] never spoke through the Prophet to
[1:25:36] create a tradition
[1:25:38] let me tell you what the real experience
[1:25:40] does you know that you've passed from
[1:25:42] death unto life it because it's more
[1:25:46] it's more than a sensation it's
[1:25:47] something that you realized hey you know
[1:25:49] what there's a greater working on the
[1:25:51] inside of me like that little spring the
[1:25:54] Prophet talked about and said why are
[1:25:55] you bubbling the way you bubble is it
[1:25:57] because the deer come and drink from you
[1:25:59] is it because this happens and he said
[1:26:01] if it had a voice it would say no it's
[1:26:03] not because you not because any of the
[1:26:05] animals there is a force that is behind
[1:26:09] me that's a real reality you know you
[1:26:14] know you pass from death unto life
[1:26:17] Christ has become alive he said the
[1:26:20] preacher won't have to tell you to do
[1:26:22] this and that the old leaves will just
[1:26:26] pop off I like these simple terms the
[1:26:31] old leaves will just pop off and new
[1:26:34] leaves will come on they've never seen
[1:26:36] new leaves sometimes I go out and look
[1:26:39] at even looking at the little plants
[1:26:41] it's done you see them little things
[1:26:42] sometimes I wonder deer been chewing on
[1:26:44] them I'm looking at them and I think
[1:26:45] we're that deer is that nubbins there
[1:26:46] but you know them little things are
[1:26:48] wound up so tight but give it a little
[1:26:51] bit of water keep on giving a little bit
[1:26:54] of water and that life you'll eventually
[1:26:56] start seeing it moving out there and
[1:26:58] there they leave starts swelling up a
[1:26:59] little bit more so you know that ain't
[1:27:01] no nothing
[1:27:02] there's a leaf coming on there and as it
[1:27:05] keeps going sucking in that water or you
[1:27:07] don't see it you don't hear it bringing
[1:27:08] in that water
[1:27:09] that's an invisible something that's
[1:27:11] going on on the inside a man
[1:27:14] there are capillaries that are ordained
[1:27:16] within that tree the root system that's
[1:27:19] below the ground is actually drawing
[1:27:21] like a straw it's drawing the nutrients
[1:27:24] and the water up into itself it is
[1:27:27] producing that's going on and you start
[1:27:29] to see that belief it's opening up old
[1:27:33] leaves plop
[1:27:39] all things pass away well do I have to
[1:27:43] pluck the leaves off no no the life
[1:27:45] moving within your head oh it causes the
[1:27:48] old leaves to plop off and then new
[1:27:51] leaves come on the tree it's inspired to
[1:27:54] you then oh my then they have just a
[1:27:58] little bit more time Kenna let's go to
[1:28:00] Ephesians four let me skip a few places
[1:28:02] here I'm coming down I know you're used
[1:28:05] to hearing that your private thing yeah
[1:28:07] right
[1:28:11] verse 20 of Ephesians 4 I'll skip a few
[1:28:14] verses here here Paul is speaking to the
[1:28:16] ephesian church and he's speaking of how
[1:28:19] he's admonishing them in the difference
[1:28:20] of how that they should not walk in the
[1:28:22] vanity of their mind as other Gentiles
[1:28:25] he says in verse 20 you have not so
[1:28:28] learned Christ if so be that you have
[1:28:31] heard him and have been taught by him as
[1:28:33] the truth is in Jesus that you put off
[1:28:37] concerning the former conversation the
[1:28:42] old man the old man which is corrupt
[1:28:47] according to the deceitful lust and be
[1:28:52] renewed in the spirit of your mind
[1:28:57] and that you put on the new man I love
[1:29:01] this put on means sink into sink into
[1:29:10] your memory Elijah was ordained by God
[1:29:14] to take the mantle that was upon the
[1:29:17] Elijah and finish out what God had told
[1:29:21] Elijah God never gave any new commands
[1:29:23] it was the finishing out of what had
[1:29:26] been given five things that Elijah was
[1:29:29] to do Elijah was the vessel that carried
[1:29:32] out the majority of that is that right
[1:29:35] God's ordained way the words going to be
[1:29:37] fulfilled because it wasn't man that was
[1:29:40] fulfilling it it's the same spirit of
[1:29:42] god through yielded vessels that's why
[1:29:44] in this hour it's not a new message that
[1:29:46] we didn't need a new message right now
[1:29:48] we don't need a new message we don't
[1:29:49] need one there's the same spirit of god
[1:29:51] that is spoke
[1:29:52] the word that is making that word come
[1:29:55] to pass and live out in our lives it's
[1:29:58] not us doing it brother brand me wooden
[1:30:00] brother branham doing it he said I'm
[1:30:02] just happened to be here when he comes
[1:30:04] he's letting us know it's a yield at all
[1:30:07] of those statements are letting you and
[1:30:08] I know it's a yield it surrendered life
[1:30:11] and God begins to move down and move
[1:30:14] right through there now look at this put
[1:30:16] on this to sink into it lashes they
[1:30:18] didn't cut down the road they didn't cut
[1:30:21] down the mantle but Elijah had to grow
[1:30:25] into it you don't tailor the this robe
[1:30:30] this mantle is not tailored it's not oh
[1:30:33] let me see let me get a measurement here
[1:30:34] and let's see do you want your how do
[1:30:36] you want your trouser sir do you want
[1:30:37] him with a brake on the front brake on
[1:30:39] the back you want a flat do you want
[1:30:40] cuffs in them how do you want how do how
[1:30:44] do you want to know this is where our
[1:30:47] lives are tailored we're ordained to be
[1:30:51] conformed to his image so he helps us to
[1:30:57] wear that we grow into this this is put
[1:31:01] on means to sink into that you put on
[1:31:04] the new man which after God is created
[1:31:08] in righteousness and true holiness in
[1:31:14] that wonderful this new man now here
[1:31:18] that new bottle now it has new wine on
[1:31:22] the inside it's a new creation not not
[1:31:25] of the old creation but of a new
[1:31:27] creation let's look here in Colossians 3
[1:31:30] verse 8 Paul picks us up again
[1:31:32] on the old man and the new man verse 8
[1:31:37] but now ye also put off all these anger
[1:31:47] wrath malice blasphemy filthy
[1:31:53] communication out of your mouth this is
[1:31:59] skin stretching
[1:32:02] put off these currently no I'm talking
[1:32:06] about its stretching it calls you to
[1:32:09] stretch malice isn't and what you say
[1:32:12] malice is things you think is that right
[1:32:16] I'm not going to ask you how many's had
[1:32:17] to repent of that but even Paul when
[1:32:20] Paul would in another place ravine out
[1:32:21] of Ephesians four Paul was admonishing
[1:32:23] the saints of God he's not speaking to
[1:32:26] unbelievers he's not speaking to the
[1:32:28] make believers this is to the believers
[1:32:30] who have access to the divine nature of
[1:32:34] God because it's dwelling on the inside
[1:32:36] of them they have a power and authority
[1:32:38] to put these off also if they've got
[1:32:42] authority to put them off where would
[1:32:43] these things be coming from not from the
[1:32:47] new bottle with a new wine but it's
[1:32:50] still out here this thing where Paul
[1:32:55] could say I pack it around when I would
[1:32:56] go to do good evil is present is that
[1:33:01] right look at this put them also off so
[1:33:05] we've got to have strength and authority
[1:33:05] to be able to do this verse nine why not
[1:33:09] one to another seeing that you have put
[1:33:13] off you have put off the old man with
[1:33:17] his deeds and have put on the new man
[1:33:21] which is renewed in knowledge after the
[1:33:25] image of him that created him where
[1:33:29] there is neither Greek nor Jew
[1:33:33] circumcision nor uncircumcision
[1:33:35] barbarian Scythian bond nor free but
[1:33:39] Christ is all and in all verse 12 oh boy
[1:33:50] here's some real stretcher put on
[1:33:54] therefore as the elect of God now wait a
[1:33:58] minute I've already put on the new man
[1:34:00] but now put on sink in into therefore as
[1:34:05] the elect of God holy and beloved boughs
[1:34:10] of mercy kindness humbleness of mine
[1:34:14] meekness long-suffering bow say help me
[1:34:18] Lord help me Lord Jesus help me help me
[1:34:22] to sink into sink into what is it submit
[1:34:25] to it you or me neither one is going to
[1:34:31] be able to stop you don't stop thoughts
[1:34:33] from flying in you don't stop that but
[1:34:38] you can stop them from roosting and this
[1:34:42] is where the scripture can say this to
[1:34:44] me when I read these scriptures right
[1:34:45] here this is an access that belongs to
[1:34:47] the elect of God it is an access that we
[1:34:51] have as the elect of God put on holy
[1:34:54] vows of mercy
[1:34:55] this vows of mercy it speaks of the
[1:34:58] spleen in our life to where there can be
[1:35:01] damaged blood cells and things that's
[1:35:03] moving through our body but that spleen
[1:35:05] will catch damaged cells and it will
[1:35:09] capture them they can't pass through
[1:35:12] certain channels it will capture them it
[1:35:15] sends them off into a certain place and
[1:35:17] they go through a recycling because they
[1:35:21] will not be allowed to continue on in
[1:35:22] the body that way Oh God I thank God for
[1:35:28] the real bowels of Mercy within our life
[1:35:31] and we're really yield to it friends and
[1:35:33] really yielding to this it helps us that
[1:35:35] thoughts and feelings and no matter
[1:35:38] what's been said or what's been done how
[1:35:40] he can help you and I so that damage
[1:35:42] cells are not passed through the rest of
[1:35:45] our body forbearing one another and
[1:35:53] forgiving one another if any man have a
[1:35:56] court against any even as Christ forgave
[1:36:04] you so also do this a powerful statement
[1:36:13] he didn't say just forgive even as even
[1:36:18] as to the same
[1:36:21] the same depth how can you and I do that
[1:36:25] can you do it can I do it no I'm just
[1:36:30] saying for you you can't do it neither
[1:36:33] can i this is where we have to sink into
[1:36:36] these places we have to sink into it
[1:36:40] the salmon sometimes thoughts come but
[1:36:43] it's not about the thoughts coming
[1:36:45] remember reject them things right back
[1:36:46] out when in your heart your heart has
[1:36:49] been cleared your heart has been
[1:36:51] purified
[1:36:52] hey listen Satan will try to stir up
[1:36:54] things again in your mind but this is
[1:36:56] where that in when it comes in that's
[1:36:59] already under the blood you're not
[1:37:01] bringing that up against my brother
[1:37:02] against my sister you're not bringing
[1:37:04] that up you're not no no no this is
[1:37:11] where we need stretching this isn't
[1:37:15] jumping and above all these things sink
[1:37:25] in to put on charity which is the bond
[1:37:30] of perfectness and let the peace of God
[1:37:36] rule in your hearts to the which also
[1:37:42] you are called in one body and be
[1:37:45] thankful
[1:37:49] here's a key right here for the sinking
[1:37:51] in to let the word of Christ dwell in
[1:37:57] you richly you know you want every part
[1:38:05] of your life you want these things to be
[1:38:08] really under the governance and
[1:38:09] subjection of the Holy Ghost this is a
[1:38:12] key right here letting the word dwell in
[1:38:16] us richly in all wisdom not just word
[1:38:21] dwelling in us but in wisdom
[1:38:24] remember what wisdom not earthly earthly
[1:38:28] wisdom is sensual earthly wisdom sides
[1:38:31] but that wisdom that comes from above is
[1:38:34] full of mercy that wisdom itself Held's
[1:38:41] within it virtue for you and not to be
[1:38:45] able to live it gives us strength
[1:38:47] oh my sometimes these things come around
[1:38:50] our way come on not just once in a while
[1:38:53] this is everyday everyday living
[1:38:58] stretching you know when you read
[1:39:01] scriptures like this we read them about
[1:39:06] forgiving there's gonna have to be
[1:39:08] incidents that come to test you on it
[1:39:11] test me on it God does not give it he
[1:39:14] just did not admonish us in this way
[1:39:16] because well you'll be immune to it
[1:39:18] you'll never have any problems you've
[1:39:20] been born again I don't have to deal
[1:39:22] with any of this it where my soul my
[1:39:25] soul your soul you've been born again of
[1:39:28] the Spirit of God my soul has never ever
[1:39:30] held anything against anybody but my
[1:39:38] mind
[1:39:40] and in my spirit and in my heart been
[1:39:44] many times cleansing cleansing sometimes
[1:39:49] there's things that we need to be
[1:39:50] cleansed of that were not even aware of
[1:39:52] it but you get before God in prayer and
[1:39:56] the Holy Ghost can move right down and
[1:39:57] say this is still in your heart you had
[1:40:04] him do that to you he's praying about a
[1:40:08] situation at one time oh god I was
[1:40:10] really crying out to God about a
[1:40:12] situation and the Holy Spirit just came
[1:40:14] right down and met me right there in the
[1:40:16] room and said before this can never
[1:40:18] happen you got to change your heart
[1:40:22] right there it was right there as soon
[1:40:24] as he spoke that to me it was release
[1:40:26] right there as soon as I could say that
[1:40:29] it was release right there because I
[1:40:32] realized it wasn't this person or it
[1:40:35] wasn't this it was here it was here but
[1:40:40] thank God thank God for His grace that I
[1:40:44] could stretch it could be moved thank
[1:40:48] God when the Holy Spirit can move down
[1:40:50] upon our life and say hey hey it's not
[1:40:53] that individual
[1:40:54] it's your bitterness Oh God Lord Jesus
[1:40:58] you see friends this is why we we need
[1:41:01] we need him to speak to us because so
[1:41:05] easily things can we can get to looking
[1:41:07] at things in one Avenue in one angle but
[1:41:10] all my how that when he comes and he
[1:41:12] speaks to us he's able to reveal and go
[1:41:15] in there to a depth and we see it as we
[1:41:18] ought to see it and when we see it like
[1:41:21] that and let it in and let it take it
[1:41:23] say Lord come Lord Jesus the reality is
[1:41:28] I know it simple I know it's a simple
[1:41:30] point we cannot do this
[1:41:34] in our own strength we cannot but the
[1:41:40] same me I've been born again of the
[1:41:41] Spirit of God that's why you need his
[1:41:44] strength
[1:41:46] we need his strength and he helps us to
[1:41:50] sink into that clothing there might be
[1:41:52] things you're looking at and you see
[1:41:54] overcoming oh my for many of us it's not
[1:41:57] about drinking it's not about smoking
[1:41:59] it's not about running around but
[1:42:01] overcoming is still putting our arm in
[1:42:06] one sleeve and giving our hand into his
[1:42:12] hand and let him put it in the other
[1:42:14] sleeve
[1:42:15] that's overcoming overcoming is not me
[1:42:20] and you muscle in our way into it
[1:42:22] overcoming it's saying here Papa you got
[1:42:26] my hand you teach me Lord how to do this
[1:42:32] help me know how to do it Lord and
[1:42:34] that's all he wants it's sinking in to
[1:42:39] this cloth this clothing this garment
[1:42:42] let me tell you something
[1:42:43] you're ordained to wear this garment yes
[1:42:46] you are you are deign to wear it this

[1:43:05] are deigned for this robe oh my what
[1:43:12] love say Lord

[1:43:22] create tenseness he comes to move and
[1:43:27] COO upon our lives but for the Bram said
[1:43:30] it like this he said standing right here

[1:43:36] been filled with new wine and they're
[1:43:38] standing here because they believe that
[1:43:41] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[1:43:42] they shall recover
