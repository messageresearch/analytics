[32:20] the the ministry there's there's some
[32:24] mighty things going on
[32:25] not just in the word that they're

[32:29] lives there's something
[32:30] they're going deeper and if and if you

[32:34] if you know how this works in the
[32:35] economy of god if they're going deeper

[32:47] helping them any way i can so
[32:49] get behind him support him support the
[32:51] word
[32:52] support him with your presence here and
[32:56] i could just go on and on in those
[32:57] things but we'll we'll go to the word
[32:59] here
[33:00] numbers 22 41 i'm going to bounce around
[33:03] a little bit just to lay a foundation
[33:05] and it came to pass on the morrow that
[33:07] balak took balaam
[33:08] and brought him up into the high places
[33:11] of baal
[33:12] and fence he might see the utmost which
[33:15] is the end part of the people
[33:17] and then if you could go to numbers 23
[33:20] and verse 13.
[33:24] 23 and verse 13 and balak said unto him
[33:27] come i pray thee with me unto another
[33:29] place
[33:30] from whence thou mayest see them thou
[33:32] shalt see but the utmost part of them
[33:35] and shall not see them all and curse me
[33:37] them from thence
[33:39] now i want to go to verse 16.
[33:43] and the lord met balaam and put a word
[33:45] in his mouth
[33:46] and said go on again unto balak and say
[33:49] thus
[33:50] and when he came to him behold he stood
[33:53] by his burnt offering in the princes of
[33:55] moab with him
[33:56] and balak said unto him what hath the
[33:58] lord spoken
[34:00] and he took up his parable and said rise
[34:02] up balak
[34:03] and hear hearken unto me thou son of the
[34:05] poor
[34:06] god is not a man that he should lie
[34:08] neither the son of man that he should
[34:10] repent
[34:12] hath he said and shall he not do it
[34:15] or hath he spoken and shall he not make
[34:17] it good
[34:18] behold i have received commandment to
[34:20] bless and
[34:22] he hath blessed and i cannot reverse it
[34:25] he hath not beheld iniquity in jacob
[34:28] neither hath he seen perverseness in
[34:30] israel
[34:31] the lord his god is with him in the
[34:33] shout of a king
[34:34] is among them god brought them out of
[34:37] egypt and he hath
[34:38] as it were the strength of a unicorn
[34:41] surely there is no enchantment against
[34:43] jacob neither is there any divination
[34:45] against
[34:46] israel according to this time it shall
[34:49] be said of jacob and of israel
[34:51] what hath god wrought and notice that's
[34:54] not a question that's an exclamation
[34:56] mark
[34:57] behold the people shall rise up as a
[34:59] great lion and lift up himself as a
[35:01] young lion
[35:02] he shall not lie down until he eat of
[35:04] the prey and drink the blood of the
[35:06] slain
[35:07] i want to turn over real quick to john
[35:10] 15
[35:12] john chapter 15
[35:15] verse 15.
[35:26] jesus speaking says henceforth i call
[35:28] you not servants
[35:30] for the servant knoweth not what his
[35:32] lord doeth
[35:33] but i have called you friends for all
[35:36] things that i have heard of my father
[35:38] i have made known unto you ye have not
[35:41] chosen me but i have chosen you
[35:45] and ordained you that ye should go and
[35:48] bring forth fruit
[35:49] and that your fruit should remain
[35:52] whatsoever you shall ask of the father
[35:54] in my name he may give it to you
[35:56] let's pray one more time lord jesus we
[35:59] ask you god to just take your word now
[36:02] and plant it in our hearts
[36:03] help me god to get fully out of the way
[36:05] that you could speak
[36:07] i ask it in jesus christ's name amen
[36:10] amen you can be seated
[36:14] i know i'm reading a lot of scriptures
[36:16] here at the beginning but i just want to
[36:17] read one more ephesians 5
[36:21] because i just want to lay a foundation
[36:24] for what i have on my heart
[36:25] and this is really speaking everything
[36:29] that i want to say here but
[36:31] we'll just expound a little bit
[36:34] ephesians 5 verse 25 brothers i added
[36:37] this one in the back so
[36:38] sorry about that husbands love your
[36:42] wives even as christ also loved the
[36:44] church
[36:44] and gave himself for it and i thought
[36:48] well we could take a sermon on that and
[36:49] switch gears but we'll just leave that
[36:51] alone
[36:53] but notice as christ also loved the
[36:56] church and he gave himself for it verse
[36:58] 26 that he might sanctify and cleanse it
[37:01] with the washing of water by the word
[37:04] that he might present it to himself a
[37:06] glorious church
[37:08] not having spot or wrinkle or any such
[37:11] thing but that it should be holy
[37:14] and without blemish notice he's going to
[37:18] watch over this bride so closely that
[37:21] one day
[37:22] he's going to present himself a glorious
[37:24] church
[37:25] he's going to present himself a church
[37:28] and if he's going to present the church
[37:30] to himself
[37:31] he's saying here i'm going to provide
[37:33] the work that's going to present the
[37:34] church
[37:35] in this way and so i want to take a
[37:38] thought this morning and i and i didn't
[37:39] have a title until the back and i don't
[37:41] even know that it's a good title but
[37:43] i want to call it a work god hath
[37:45] wrought despite the utmost parts
[37:48] and we'll go into this further a work
[37:50] god hath wrought
[37:51] despite the utmost parts and um
[37:55] a brother gave me a book i'm a bit of a
[37:57] perfectionist
[37:58] um a bit as a is quite an understatement
[38:01] i'm a pretty big perfectionist i like
[38:03] i just like things now you're going to
[38:04] think well he was in the back with a
[38:06] white glove
[38:09] i promise i wasn't i'm a big
[38:13] perfectionist and
[38:14] and and uh you know it's got it's it's
[38:16] blessings it's curses it's good
[38:18] it's bad and and i i expect a lot of
[38:21] myself
[38:22] sometimes that extends to others i i
[38:24] just i just have
[38:27] a lot of times too high of expectations
[38:30] and when you're that built that way uh
[38:32] you set yourself up for a lot of
[38:34] disappointment too
[38:36] so um so a brother i was talking with
[38:38] him just
[38:39] just having some fellowship and he said
[38:40] well i i got this book a couple years
[38:43] ago he said i'll give it to you well
[38:45] he ordered it and it was a used book and
[38:47] so he handed it to me and he said
[38:48] i just want to let you know i the
[38:51] highlights in it were not
[38:52] mine for you he said they were it was a
[38:54] used book they were there before
[38:57] but it's it's about this perfectionist
[38:59] and i'm a slow reader and things so i
[39:01] i'm not too far
[39:02] in it but something that's really spoken
[39:04] to me that so far as
[39:06] the guy laying a foundation the author
[39:08] is and he's saying
[39:09] you know we live we live in a world that
[39:12] is
[39:12] is expects perfection it's
[39:15] it sets a bar of perfection that is very
[39:19] difficult to reach
[39:20] whether it's in your your job uh
[39:24] your job may set a standard of
[39:25] perfection that
[39:27] you know really you just you can't do
[39:29] anything to please the boss
[39:30] nothing you do is going to be good
[39:31] enough or what you do you know it
[39:34] hey that's great but let's do better you
[39:37] know the company is always going to be
[39:38] looking for
[39:39] how we can do better and you know if
[39:41] you're a business owner i i guess that's
[39:43] what makes a successful company but
[39:45] you know you have a world of of it's
[39:47] it's competing for things and
[39:49] unless you set a bar of perfection
[39:52] that's way up here
[39:53] you're not going to be used very much
[39:55] because people are demanding perfection
[39:57] because
[39:57] they have things like you know the the
[40:00] the
[40:01] you know fixer-upper show and and uh
[40:04] joanna gaines and all these things and
[40:06] and you know you have you have fashion
[40:08] that is is
[40:10] expecting perfection out of you if you
[40:12] wear something that's a little outdated
[40:14] you're looked at funny you know you got
[40:16] to keep up with the times you got
[40:17] you know and my goodness you know
[40:20] brothers and sisters
[40:21] as christians will never meet that bar
[40:23] because we're just old-fashioned anyway
[40:25] in in the way we believe in things and
[40:27] the way we dress is so they say
[40:29] um i i think that you know a sister that
[40:32] dresses modest is a beautiful thing in
[40:33] the sight of god and should be in the
[40:35] side of man
[40:36] but you know it's just an appreciation
[40:38] that we have for our sister so thank you
[40:40] sisters for dressing modestly and
[40:42] don't feel like you have to go out and
[40:44] reach that bar because
[40:45] you know one thing you'll never attain
[40:47] it it's always moving but the second is
[40:49] that's not true beauty anyway
[40:51] what you see in in the magazines and
[40:53] things in in in fashion world that's all
[40:56] it's either airbrushed on or it's
[40:58] computer it generated
[40:59] and so it sets this this this vision
[41:03] before you of perfection that
[41:05] is just listen it's it's fake
[41:08] it's fake perfection you'll never
[41:10] accomplish it because they take it and
[41:11] they
[41:12] throw it through a computer and that's
[41:13] what they do with it
[41:15] magazines set the it's it's a perfect
[41:18] picture
[41:19] it's it's so perfect they but they set
[41:21] it up that way that wasn't you know that
[41:23] that lady had to clean her house
[41:24] and and pick up the the kids toys in the
[41:27] yard before they could even take that
[41:29] picture and
[41:30] maybe they bring things in and set
[41:31] things up to to add a little bit to it
[41:33] to make it look so perfect and appealing
[41:35] to you
[41:36] and then you have you know this the the
[41:38] models and things you have
[41:40] hollywood and in in the news you have
[41:43] the news in
[41:44] in in in politics you know politics with
[41:47] this whole covet thing
[41:48] you'll you'll never and now you know now
[41:51] i hear of people
[41:52] you know they'll beat you up if you if
[41:54] you're not complying with the the
[41:56] standards and things that
[41:57] you know it's just it's just the times
[41:59] we live in and it's and it's a bar of
[42:01] perfection
[42:02] that you you just you'll never you'll
[42:04] you'll
[42:05] you'll meet it and then it'll move
[42:08] and if you meet it again it'll move
[42:10] again and so
[42:12] sometimes as family members you know
[42:14] again i mean being a perfectionist
[42:15] sometimes as
[42:16] a father i can demand i can extend that
[42:19] perfection on my children or my wife i
[42:21] can
[42:22] and you know we do that to our families
[42:24] we can do it in the church we can expect
[42:27] perfection out of out of imperfect
[42:29] people
[42:31] you're dealing with imperfect people in
[42:33] an imperfect world
[42:34] despite what the front satan wants to
[42:36] put on it but
[42:38] it's it's a perfection that that you
[42:40] you're you're expecting
[42:42] out of imperfect things so we put high
[42:46] expectations on ourselves which as i
[42:48] said it sets us up
[42:49] for for many disappointments can you say
[42:51] amen
[42:54] so we went on we went on a vacation and
[42:56] and you know i'm just going to drive
[42:57] this home a little bit we went on a
[42:59] vacation and you know we're sitting
[43:00] there we're camping and
[43:02] as we're sitting around the campfire
[43:03] you're watching you know trucks and
[43:05] campers go out you know and you're kind
[43:07] of admiring and things and i don't know
[43:09] what it was but it was like all the
[43:10] trucks and campers that pulled in
[43:12] afterwards got bigger and newer and
[43:14] nicer
[43:16] and better and you know it was a real
[43:18] test in
[43:20] uh uh discontentment it was
[43:24] you know the there's you know it's it's
[43:26] i i'd like to have a truck i've been
[43:28] wanting a truck for some time but just
[43:30] different circumstances and things and
[43:32] finances you know you try to get it all
[43:34] set up just right but then
[43:35] you know well maybe i can settle for
[43:37] something a little bit less than what i
[43:39] want but then you see
[43:40] something like you know the brand new
[43:42] f350 pull in pull in a
[43:45] four-story camper and you're like man
[43:47] that'd be good to have you know
[43:49] but it but you know it sets this bar
[43:51] that really
[43:52] i mean i'm not it's not out of god's
[43:54] reach but really it's out of my means
[43:56] right now and so
[43:57] i could go buy that but i'd have to you
[43:59] know sell my home and go live strictly
[44:01] in that but
[44:03] you know you you but you there's a
[44:06] feeling in this world i've always
[44:08] you gotta keep up with the joneses you
[44:10] gotta you know somebody you know
[44:11] somebody in the church gets a new
[44:13] vehicle and you're like man i'd sure
[44:14] like that you know and then
[44:16] and then your your eyes become you know
[44:18] it kind of becomes the star in your eyes
[44:20] and you know you're just you didn't
[44:22] realize how hard that they've worked or
[44:23] how long
[44:24] you know young brothers that brothers
[44:26] you know in his
[44:27] 50s 60s he's put in his time and and he
[44:30] deserves the truck now you know so
[44:32] uh don't don't try to match up you know
[44:35] i think i said it last time to the young
[44:36] couples you know you'll spend the first
[44:38] five years this is a dave ramsey thing
[44:40] he said you'll spend the first five
[44:42] years
[44:43] trying to live up to the standard to to
[44:45] where your parents are
[44:46] but the problem is is you didn't see
[44:48] everything that they had to go through
[44:50] because you were blind to it growing up
[44:51] because mom and dad just provided it
[44:54] you just got to enjoy it so you want to
[44:56] can take that enjoyment and continue
[44:58] that into your marriage but you don't
[44:59] realize you're not thinking
[45:01] that that took them a long time i'm
[45:03] really preaching to myself here getting
[45:04] convicted
[45:07] you know that took a long time for them
[45:09] to get to so you know
[45:11] brothers and sisters my my young friends
[45:13] you know just keep keep going forward
[45:15] keep
[45:15] keep doing what you're doing and and you
[45:18] know pray and god will bless you it
[45:19] might not be today you might have to
[45:21] settle for something that that might be
[45:23] in our to what we want less but you know
[45:26] just
[45:26] just keep going at it and god will bless
[45:28] you with it one day he said seek ye
[45:30] first the kingdom of god
[45:32] and then these things will be added unto
[45:33] you so seek that first my young brother
[45:36] and sister be faithful in the little
[45:37] things and god will bless you and much
[45:41] so and i want to encourage you to i'm
[45:43] kind of all over the place but i just
[45:45] i've had a lot on my my mind here lately
[45:47] but you know
[45:48] getting to take this little time of rest
[45:50] you know it was a it was
[45:52] it was a time to really unplug and and
[45:54] you know in this age of perfection and
[45:57] along those lines
[45:58] you know i want to encourage each of us
[46:00] young and old and
[46:02] ministry the the ones in the back the
[46:04] ones cleaning the church
[46:05] the ones you know just whatever you're
[46:07] doing if you if you
[46:09] if you don't necessarily have a job in
[46:10] the church and you just come and you
[46:12] pull on the gift
[46:13] you still have a job and daily living
[46:15] and things and and you really need to
[46:16] unplug from that because
[46:18] because because this life demands
[46:20] perfection
[46:22] and because we are imperfect beings it
[46:24] makes us tired
[46:26] it'll drain you and you really have to
[46:29] unplug from that and you know we would
[46:31] go
[46:31] different places my wife and i just to
[46:33] get a little rest and things but
[46:34] but i i never really unplugged like i
[46:37] did this last
[46:38] this last week and until now because
[46:42] we went our phones were out of data um
[46:45] because i just i don't want to pay too
[46:46] much so i you know we share just
[46:49] like two gigabytes of data which is
[46:51] really low but
[46:52] you know it gets us by but anyway so but
[46:55] you know it
[46:56] so that ran out the we didn't get good
[46:58] reception because we're back in the
[47:00] woods so we didn't have connection to
[47:01] the wi-fi we didn't have the data
[47:03] and i'll tell you what and and my pastor
[47:06] said you know brandon
[47:08] just shut your phone off put a message
[47:09] on there that you're out of town
[47:11] you can get a hold of me if they need me
[47:13] but just just
[47:14] shut her down and i took him up on it
[47:16] this time i always thought that i did
[47:18] that but i really did it this time
[47:20] and i'll tell you what i finally relaxed
[47:22] and i'll
[47:23] listen a couple of times i saw the news
[47:26] and i could feel myself start like
[47:28] getting nervous and i just thought no
[47:29] you know what just just
[47:31] unplug from it all just unplug from it
[47:33] all and i want to
[47:34] encourage you to do that brothers when
[47:36] you go out on vacation you do not need
[47:38] to keep your phone on
[47:39] that's right my wife is taking good
[47:42] notes right now
[47:45] i'm thankful my family got to come with
[47:47] me i haven't been able to yet so
[47:52] i appreciate them she she really puts in
[47:55] the sacrifice so thankful
[47:56] thankful for that but you know you you
[47:59] really
[48:00] it's you're i don't want to i don't want
[48:02] to be mean but i'm going to say it
[48:03] straight you're not that important
[48:06] shut it down you are important but
[48:10] not important enough that you can't shut
[48:13] your phone off or
[48:14] or at least you know put it on vibrate
[48:16] put it in airplane mode do not disturb
[48:19] throw it down
[48:20] don't connect to the wi-fi don't look at
[48:22] the news
[48:23] the world's going to go on without you
[48:25] you know but
[48:26] shut it shut it down and
[48:29] brothers and sisters i'm gonna okay so
[48:31] we got the brothers i'm gonna get the
[48:32] sisters but i know the brothers are just
[48:34] as guilty so we'll
[48:35] stay on this remember i only read the
[48:37] scripture about christ laying down his
[48:39] life for the
[48:39] for the for the bride so that was
[48:41] talking about the husbands we didn't get
[48:42] to the sister so
[48:44] here you are brothers but to unplugged
[48:47] from the social media
[48:49] listen social media people enjoy
[48:53] looking at your photos and things they
[48:54] enjoy seeing about your life i'm sure
[48:56] but
[48:57] but though life will go on for them
[48:59] without you
[49:01] and and you know especially if you're a
[49:02] business owner or something you know
[49:04] these things are important but just
[49:05] get away from it for a while and and
[49:08] you know i i had a couple of things that
[49:10] i wrote here
[49:12] if you're depressed get off the social
[49:14] media
[49:15] if you're anxious get off the news if
[49:18] you're stressed
[49:18] shut your phone off for an evening say
[49:21] well i can't go out of town right now
[49:23] well do it for the evening i promise you
[49:27] just listen try it if it doesn't work
[49:30] you can come back and tell me i'm wrong
[49:34] one day might not be enough sometimes it
[49:37] takes a couple days okay i'm not i'm not
[49:39] trying to make excuses for myself if you
[49:41] want to come back and tell me i'm wrong
[49:42] but i'm telling you
[49:43] sometimes we're so plugged into things
[49:46] in in this
[49:46] this realm of perfection that's demanded
[49:49] of us that
[49:50] that we just it takes us a couple days
[49:52] to unwind and get out of it
[49:55] take it for what it's worth but i
[49:57] promise you it'll help you
[49:58] you know jesus said that he got god gave
[50:02] us a day of rest
[50:03] and he did that for a reason because he
[50:05] knew the human body
[50:07] amen he knew the human body you say well
[50:09] brother you're preaching psychology no
[50:11] i'm preaching the creation of god
[50:14] god the creator knew that that we
[50:16] weren't meant to be
[50:17] to be it it is but we're not meant to be
[50:21] in this fast-paced environment this rat
[50:23] race that's that's why you have
[50:25] anxiety and and that's why brother
[50:27] branham said it'll be complete neurotics
[50:30] because it's just there's such a demand
[50:32] on you and there's
[50:33] and and i'm so totally taken too long on
[50:37] this worst part
[50:40] but i i pray that this helps you and i
[50:42] pray that encourages you you know i
[50:43] especially i see the young faces and
[50:45] and i just say you know if you can get
[50:47] this now you know you'll be so much
[50:49] better off later
[50:51] just just establish these things in your
[50:53] home now amen and
[50:55] and as your family grows you'll see the
[50:58] importance of these things
[51:02] when you tell yourself you can't do it
[51:04] you can't unplug
[51:05] you'll know that these things are
[51:06] controlling you instead of you
[51:09] controlling it
[51:10] paul wrote all things are lawful but all
[51:14] things are not edifying and profitable
[51:16] for my good
[51:18] all things are lawful he said but i
[51:20] won't be brought under the power
[51:22] and that word power actually means a
[51:24] slave of any
[51:25] right so if you say brother i can't do
[51:28] it i just can't do it well
[51:29] just simply know that you have become a
[51:32] slave to that thing and you have to ask
[51:33] yourself that question do you want to be
[51:36] a slave to anything
[51:38] or do you want to just be a slave to
[51:40] jesus christ amen
[51:43] so
[51:48] are we all familiar with the story of
[51:50] balaam
[51:51] is anybody not so if you if you're not
[51:53] i'd encourage you to read numbers 22 to
[51:55] 25
[51:56] because i just want to draw some things
[51:58] out of here for a moment numbers 22 and
[52:00] verse 5.
[52:05] i want i just want to pull a couple
[52:07] things out of here
[52:18] numbers 22 verse 5 he sent messengers
[52:21] balak did
[52:22] therefore unto balaam the son of beor of
[52:25] pathor pethor which is by the river of
[52:28] the land of the children of his people
[52:30] to call him saying behold there's a
[52:32] people come out from egypt
[52:34] behold they cover the face of the earth
[52:37] and they abide over against me
[52:39] now i want i want to i i've got this
[52:41] highlighted because i want you to notice
[52:42] the testimony that the children of
[52:44] israel have they cover the face of the
[52:47] earth
[52:49] they didn't really right at that time
[52:52] they didn't really they had just come
[52:53] out of egypt they're traveling
[52:55] on into the wilderness and but this is
[52:57] the testimony of god before the people
[53:00] round about is that this people is so
[53:02] great that they cover the face of the
[53:03] earth
[53:04] and he's calling for balaam come because
[53:06] they their theirs they're set against me
[53:08] come now
[53:09] therefore i pray thee curse me this
[53:11] people
[53:12] for they are too mighty for me so that's
[53:15] the testimony of the people of god
[53:17] they cover the face of the earth they're
[53:19] so mighty they're too mighty for me
[53:23] pear adventure i shall prevail if you
[53:25] curse these people i'll prevail
[53:27] that we may smite them and that i may
[53:29] drive them out of the land
[53:30] for i walk which means i perceive i
[53:33] understand and know that
[53:35] listen now watch his words he whom now
[53:38] blesseth
[53:38] is blessed and he whom now cursed is
[53:41] cursed
[53:43] but i want you to watch the first thing
[53:46] in here
[53:47] so we talked about the testimony that
[53:49] that is going before the children of
[53:51] israel the what
[53:52] what god the work that god's doing in
[53:54] the people
[53:56] and then i want you to notice that balak
[53:58] is is appealing to balaam he's trying to
[54:00] appeal to him
[54:01] and he's trying to puff him up and he's
[54:04] trying to set
[54:05] a bar of perfection before him
[54:10] and he says the people who
[54:13] you bless are blessed and the people who
[54:16] you curse
[54:17] are cursed but i want you to notice in
[54:21] genesis 12
[54:22] and verse 1 you don't you don't have to
[54:24] turn there
[54:26] genesis 12 and verse 1 now the lord had
[54:28] said
[54:29] unto abraham abram get thee out of thy
[54:32] country and from thy kindred and from
[54:33] the father's house
[54:35] unto a land which i will show thee and i
[54:37] will make of thee a great nation
[54:39] and i will bless thee and make thy name
[54:42] great and thou shalt be a blessing
[54:45] watch now this is god talking and i will
[54:48] bless them that bless thee
[54:49] and curse them that cursed thee and in
[54:52] thee shall families of the earth be
[54:54] blessed
[54:56] so god god is the one who said this
[54:59] first
[55:00] now i don't know if balak caught wind of
[55:02] that if he knew this part of the
[55:04] testimony of the children of israel
[55:07] or or what it was but notice he twists
[55:10] the words
[55:11] god said i will bless who bless you i
[55:14] will curse who curse you
[55:16] balak is saying balaam who you bless is
[55:20] blessed and who you curse is cursed
[55:23] but watch numbers 22 and verse 12 god
[55:26] even told balaam the truth
[55:28] and god said unto balaam thou shalt not
[55:30] go with them
[55:31] thou shalt not curse the people for they
[55:34] are blessed
[55:35] in other words i have blessed them you
[55:38] cannot reverse that
[55:44] and then they testify to balak numbers
[55:47] 24 and verse
[55:48] 9. he couched he lay down as a lion
[55:52] and his great lion who shall stir him up
[55:54] blessed is he that blesseth thee
[55:57] and curseth is he that curseth thee
[56:00] so god's reiterating this through the
[56:02] prophecy he takes control of balaam's
[56:04] vocal cords and he's
[56:05] and he's telling them look i've blessed
[56:08] them
[56:09] and who blesses them is blessed who
[56:11] curse them is cursed
[56:12] and yet balak and balaam are trying to
[56:15] get this curse
[56:16] out knowing the truth that it can't be
[56:18] done
[56:20] god set it up listen we're we're set up
[56:23] on the basis of god's word
[56:24] god set this up on the basis of his word
[56:27] that who i bless is blessed who i curse
[56:30] is curse
[56:30] and no man can undo that and so there
[56:34] so the word of the lord is coming to
[56:36] these men trying to get them to
[56:37] understand look
[56:38] you're you're beating against the air
[56:41] it's not going to work try as hard as
[56:43] you want to
[56:44] but it can't be done so
[56:51] balak in our opening scripture balak
[56:54] took balaam
[56:55] to look at the worst part of god's
[56:57] people
[56:59] he took him and he and he wanted he said
[57:01] that that end part that
[57:03] utmost part that's that's the worst part
[57:05] it's the back
[57:06] side of the people he said i don't want
[57:08] you to overlook the whole thing
[57:10] i don't want you to see the the
[57:12] beginning from the end i don't want you
[57:14] to see it's just
[57:15] this part that lags behind a little bit
[57:17] they're the worst among them
[57:18] so i want to come i want to show you
[57:20] their bad parts i want to show you this
[57:22] bad side because if you see this side of
[57:24] them
[57:24] surely surely you'll be able to curse
[57:27] them
[57:28] surely this god will let you curse this
[57:30] people
[57:31] if you see all the things if you see
[57:34] their worst parts
[57:36] satan is the accuser of the brethren he
[57:40] constantly tries to show god our utmost
[57:42] parts
[57:43] now listen i have a very bad memory so
[57:46] if i say anything here that you heard me
[57:48] say before
[57:49] just a minute okay
[57:53] but satan's the accuser of the brethren
[57:55] and so satan's always trying to say hey
[57:56] did you look what they did
[57:58] did you look what she did did you did
[58:00] you look at
[58:01] look you know they know that they
[58:03] shouldn't be looking in the fashion
[58:04] magazine at that
[58:05] and and really wanting to be that but
[58:08] look at look at
[58:09] you see what you see what she's looking
[58:10] at look did you see what he did he he
[58:13] blew off the handle
[58:14] did you see that he's got an anger issue
[58:18] look at that this is the worst parts of
[58:20] them god you've got to see this people
[58:22] just give up on them
[58:26] let me have them fully how can you say
[58:29] this is your people look at the bad
[58:31] parts look at these parts so this is
[58:33] what balak is trying to do to get to get
[58:36] balaam to get god really to be able to
[58:39] let balaam curse this people
[58:42] the prophet of god said the utmost parts
[58:44] were their worst parts
[58:45] the things that they've done wrong these
[58:47] are all things i pulled out that he
[58:49] talked about
[58:50] the the utmost parts he called them the
[58:52] rotten parts
[58:54] the lowest and little parts the bad
[58:56] parts the scattered parts
[58:58] they they were at the end they're
[59:00] they're scattered a bit they're not
[59:02] keeping up with the group maybe
[59:04] you know and and here he is here listen
[59:07] now
[59:07] if you think you're the weakest of
[59:09] christians here's
[59:11] here's satan here's here's bala saying
[59:13] hey
[59:14] come around look at look at this one
[59:16] lagging behind a little bit
[59:18] don't don't look at the rest of them up
[59:20] there look at this one
[59:22] look at this brother not living like he
[59:24] should just yet he's still going to
[59:26] church yeah i know that but
[59:27] but look at him look at him he might be
[59:30] trying but he's failing don't you see
[59:32] the failures
[59:34] don't you see the the the they're the
[59:36] weakest among the christians
[59:38] but then we have a prophet come in our
[59:40] day who says
[59:42] when the weakest of christians get down
[59:44] on their knees satan trembles
[59:45] [Applause]
[59:50] i'm giving you a different testimony of
[59:52] this morning
[59:53] i'm giving you a different testimony
[59:55] despite what you may think of yourself
[59:58] despite what satan tells you you are i'm
[1:00:00] trying to tell you what god says you
[1:00:02] are.
[1:00:06] satan shows god our lowest moments the
[1:00:08] times we give into the flesh the places
[1:00:11] where we're little in or have a lot more
[1:00:14] growing to do
[1:00:15] the places that make us feel bad about
[1:00:18] how our walk with the lord has been
[1:00:20] right listen anybody else have those
[1:00:22] because i'll
[1:00:23] if i could raise both my feet too i
[1:00:25] would
[1:00:26] and and and you know and satan knows
[1:00:29] that that
[1:00:29] satan knows my bent and that
[1:00:31] perfectionism i
[1:00:33] hopefully that's the best thing to call
[1:00:34] it it's the best i know
[1:00:36] satan knows that i'm bent that way so
[1:00:38] he's constantly bringing things up he's
[1:00:40] constantly leaving my
[1:00:42] my utmost parts before me he's
[1:00:44] constantly taking me back to
[1:00:46] the mistakes i've made he's constantly
[1:00:49] bringing up these things and and i
[1:00:50] imagine it's the same for you
[1:00:52] imagine he's constantly he wants you to
[1:00:54] focus on those things the places where
[1:00:56] you feel small
[1:00:57] in in your walk in the lord the places
[1:00:59] where you know that you need to be doing
[1:01:01] better
[1:01:02] but you you're just you're still
[1:01:04] struggling in that area
[1:01:07] you're still fighting now if you're
[1:01:08] giving in listen you're just giving in
[1:01:11] but if there's something in your heart
[1:01:13] and and you're just
[1:01:14] you're saying but god i don't want to be
[1:01:16] that way but you find yourself
[1:01:18] doing it and you say but brother you're
[1:01:19] supposed to be preaching the gospel in
[1:01:21] christianity
[1:01:22] i am because paul said the things that i
[1:01:24] don't want to do i find myself doing
[1:01:27] and the things that i want to do i can't
[1:01:29] seem to do
[1:01:31] so don't look at me in a pious attitude
[1:01:34] and say well
[1:01:35] you brother or these brothers and
[1:01:37] sisters because i can tell you you got a
[1:01:39] religious spirit
[1:01:43] if you're feeling that way because i am
[1:01:45] preaching the gospel
[1:01:47] and if you feel that way about your
[1:01:48] brothers and sisters then go tell paul
[1:01:52] go tell the prophet paul that he was he
[1:01:55] was a heathen
[1:01:56] go tell him that he didn't he can't say
[1:01:58] those things and be a christian
[1:02:00] but i will preach to you that there is a
[1:02:02] power in the gospel
[1:02:04] that if you stay with it just like i
[1:02:06] said with the natural things that you
[1:02:08] have in your heart's desire
[1:02:09] if you'll stay with it then you will get
[1:02:12] there by the grace of god
[1:02:13] because remember it's a work of the holy
[1:02:15] ghost it's not a work of yourself
[1:02:18] it's not something you can do within
[1:02:20] yourself go ahead and try and try you
[1:02:22] may but you'll wear yourself out doing
[1:02:24] it
[1:02:25] you have to be completely reliant on the
[1:02:27] holy spirit
[1:02:28] you have one thing that you got to do
[1:02:30] and that is surrender
[1:02:33] and listen i'll give you a quote you can
[1:02:35] go look it up i can't tell you where
[1:02:36] it's at but i found it and it ministered
[1:02:38] so much to me
[1:02:39] he said the woman wrote in questions and
[1:02:41] answers 1964. i can tell you that much
[1:02:44] a woman a woman writes in because he
[1:02:46] says i don't i don't know who you are
[1:02:48] but then the prophet starts speaking to
[1:02:49] a woman so i guarantee you that was a
[1:02:51] woman that wrote that question in
[1:02:54] and she says i i have a problem
[1:02:56] submitting
[1:02:57] do i have an evil spirit and he says
[1:03:00] why do you have problem submitting it's
[1:03:03] just like and he goes into this thing
[1:03:05] and again
[1:03:05] taking it from the woman's standpoint so
[1:03:07] i know he knows this was a woman
[1:03:09] and he said it's like sister you
[1:03:11] spending all your life
[1:03:13] trying to keep yourself pure and chaste
[1:03:16] and then one day you take a husband and
[1:03:18] you get married
[1:03:19] and then you give yourself fully over to
[1:03:22] him
[1:03:22] everything that you kept chase and pure
[1:03:25] all this time
[1:03:26] in your single years you give fully over
[1:03:29] to him in your married years and he said
[1:03:31] it's just the same with god
[1:03:33] it's just that simple you just give
[1:03:34] yourself over to him
[1:03:36] you just it just depends on what you
[1:03:38] yield to
[1:03:40] i i'm trying to think out how to break
[1:03:42] that down more but you yield to it you
[1:03:44] give in to it
[1:03:45] it depends on what you give into and
[1:03:47] then he answers the question
[1:03:49] do i have an evil spirit and he said no
[1:03:51] i don't think you have an evil spirit
[1:03:53] but that is an evil spirit that tells
[1:03:55] you you have an evil spirit
[1:03:58] isn't that good and i'll tell you
[1:04:01] because listen
[1:04:02] satan will look at the things that you
[1:04:03] do wrong and he say boy you took on a
[1:04:05] spirit
[1:04:07] girl you got a spirit right there right
[1:04:09] right here back at this date this time
[1:04:11] back when you did this
[1:04:12] okay so god delivered you of that but
[1:04:14] you did it over again over here so you
[1:04:16] took a spirit here okay god
[1:04:18] forgave you for that you're moving on
[1:04:19] with christ but you did it over here
[1:04:20] again so
[1:04:21] so you took on a spirit there and
[1:04:23] eventually you might take on a spirit if
[1:04:25] you keep down that path but i'm telling
[1:04:26] you
[1:04:27] it's the devil that makes you think that
[1:04:28] you took on a spirit
[1:04:31] amen
[1:04:35] but god responds
[1:04:40] he says you come here and show me their
[1:04:42] lowest parts
[1:04:44] but then he tells he tells balaam we'll
[1:04:46] read it in a quote here in a minute
[1:04:47] and he says but this is god's response
[1:04:50] to the prophecy of balaam
[1:04:52] he says you came to show me their lowest
[1:04:54] parts
[1:04:55] but i'm looking at them from the heights
[1:04:58] i'm looking at them from beginning
[1:05:00] to the end
[1:05:04] god's second blessing so so this is the
[1:05:06] second time that balaam and balak tried
[1:05:09] this
[1:05:09] and this is the second blessing that god
[1:05:11] tells about the children of israel
[1:05:14] it was one of justification god looking
[1:05:17] at his people through an atonement
[1:05:19] brother branham said they had a smitten
[1:05:21] rock that god was looking at them
[1:05:23] through
[1:05:24] they had a brass serpent that god was
[1:05:26] looking at them through
[1:05:28] and sometimes we look at each other the
[1:05:30] way balak showed balaam
[1:05:32] the children of israel the way satan
[1:05:34] looks at us and i really i
[1:05:38] sometime maybe for back home this was
[1:05:40] just a fresh thought that i've been
[1:05:42] thinking on so you're getting it for the
[1:05:43] first time so
[1:05:45] good or bad but i want to hone this a
[1:05:49] little bit more
[1:05:50] sometime about about the body of christ
[1:05:53] and how we view each other
[1:05:54] we've hit on that quite a bit this
[1:05:55] morning so i don't think i'll go on it
[1:05:57] more but
[1:05:58] but i just think it's really important
[1:05:59] you know we can it being in a local body
[1:06:02] and i think you should be in a local
[1:06:04] body i think you should find
[1:06:05] a a church to call home i think you
[1:06:07] should find a pastor to call pastor
[1:06:10] i i believe that those things are
[1:06:11] important for you
[1:06:13] and and and and you know it's something
[1:06:15] that that man has put there in that area
[1:06:18] to help
[1:06:18] see you through to heaven we we all want
[1:06:21] to make it to heaven and
[1:06:22] god puts a man he puts a local body
[1:06:24] there he puts people in that body to to
[1:06:27] send you an
[1:06:28] encouraging text to to talk to you and
[1:06:30] to give you a smile and things and to
[1:06:32] encourage one another
[1:06:33] god sets up the body of christ that way
[1:06:35] and sometimes
[1:06:37] we can we can look at each other
[1:06:39] especially in the local body and we get
[1:06:40] so carnal with it
[1:06:42] and and you know i'll just be honest
[1:06:44] sometimes in positions in church
[1:06:46] especially
[1:06:47] you get you get carnal and there's
[1:06:48] carnal impersonations brother branham
[1:06:50] called it and
[1:06:52] you get in this carnal mindset you know
[1:06:54] don't try to bring your job
[1:06:56] not that god wouldn't use what what he's
[1:06:58] called you to do in the natural sense
[1:07:00] to to help out in the church but don't
[1:07:02] bring that
[1:07:03] that work worldly work mindset into the
[1:07:06] church because it doesn't work here
[1:07:08] that's not how god set this up you don't
[1:07:10] well i because i do this at work i
[1:07:13] i gotta do this at church well it might
[1:07:15] not be that way
[1:07:17] your pastor might not set it up that way
[1:07:19] he might he might not want you to be
[1:07:21] fully how you are at work
[1:07:23] helping in the church is that okay but
[1:07:26] but you know we get we get carnal
[1:07:28] and and we get in this mindset and then
[1:07:30] we start looking at each other through
[1:07:31] this
[1:07:32] through through the utmost parts there's
[1:07:34] a scripture that that our pastor was
[1:07:36] speaking on and he and it says looking
[1:07:38] beyond the flesh
[1:07:40] we have to look beyond the flesh at one
[1:07:42] another because we are imperfect human
[1:07:44] beings
[1:07:44] because we are in this flesh we are
[1:07:46] going to make mistakes we are going to
[1:07:48] have times where we
[1:07:49] we we disappoint one another and we
[1:07:51] offend one another a little bit and
[1:07:53] things and
[1:07:54] you know we need to forgive forget and
[1:07:56] move on
[1:07:57] amen
[1:08:04] so we see each other's fleshly parts and
[1:08:07] then we can draw conclusions about one
[1:08:08] another
[1:08:09] and then we run each other down to
[1:08:11] others and that that shouldn't be so
[1:08:13] we shouldn't do that but see
[1:08:18] what that's compared to here because god
[1:08:20] doesn't look at you
[1:08:22] that way and he doesn't want us to look
[1:08:24] at each other that way
[1:08:26] amen so i want to take this thought of
[1:08:30] of god looking at this people
[1:08:34] and and he says i don't even see
[1:08:38] let's let's go to numbers 22. just pull
[1:08:40] it up so i
[1:08:41] catch it right
[1:08:51] let me make sure i have that right i'm
[1:08:53] sorry numbers 23
[1:08:57] numbers 23 19.
[1:09:09] verse 21 i'm sorry
[1:09:13] well let's just catch 20. i'm that's
[1:09:16] it's all so good he says behold i
[1:09:20] i uh behold i have received commandment
[1:09:23] to bless and he hath blessed
[1:09:26] why did he do that because god said
[1:09:28] those who i bless will be blessed and
[1:09:30] those who i curse will be cursed
[1:09:33] but watch now he says balaam saying and
[1:09:36] i cannot reverse it
[1:09:38] no matter how hard i try i cannot
[1:09:41] reverse
[1:09:41] this blessing now i'm not talking about
[1:09:44] the children of israel here i'm talking
[1:09:45] about you
[1:09:47] i'm talking about you your life your
[1:09:49] family the people sitting next to you
[1:09:51] the people over in in petersburg
[1:09:54] michigan
[1:09:55] uh the the body of christ god
[1:09:58] this blessing on this people cannot be
[1:10:01] reversed
[1:10:03] the blessing on your life i want you to
[1:10:06] make that personal
[1:10:07] the blessing on your life cannot be
[1:10:10] reversed
[1:10:13] verse 21.
[1:10:16] he listen this is how god sees israel
[1:10:19] and this is how god sees you he hath
[1:10:22] not beheld iniquity in jacob
[1:10:26] listen jacob as a man was a shyster
[1:10:32] he was no good just a liar
[1:10:37] and and yet god said jacob have i loved
[1:10:40] and esau have i hated
[1:10:43] and here he's saying i hath not beheld
[1:10:46] iniquity
[1:10:46] in jacob and it's not just that jacob
[1:10:49] it's the children of israel now the
[1:10:51] descendants of jacob
[1:10:53] and he's saying i don't even see these
[1:10:55] things that you're trying to tell me and
[1:10:58] and and that can't be reversed
[1:11:02] and then he says neither hath he seen
[1:11:05] the perverseness
[1:11:06] of israel perverse is a is a is a big
[1:11:09] word
[1:11:10] right
[1:11:13] hope i don't get myself in trouble if
[1:11:15] somebody you know we
[1:11:17] we they're designated a pervert that's
[1:11:20] going to be hard for them to get by
[1:11:22] right i mean that's just you're always
[1:11:25] going to look at them that way
[1:11:27] right i mean that that's like one of the
[1:11:29] worst things you could be called today
[1:11:32] but god says for
[1:11:36] art for us for me the times that
[1:11:39] have been perverse in my life god says i
[1:11:42] don't even see it
[1:11:43] right i don't even see it now i want to
[1:11:45] i want to
[1:11:47] shift gears here or take this a little
[1:11:49] bit deeper matthew 26 are you with me
[1:11:52] matthew 26 verse 27. you don't got to
[1:11:55] turn there if you don't want to
[1:11:57] um they're pulling it up quickly for us
[1:11:59] and he took the cup and gave thanks
[1:12:01] and gave it to them saying drink ye all
[1:12:04] of it
[1:12:04] now watch for this is my blood of the
[1:12:07] new
[1:12:08] testament testament is a covenant this
[1:12:10] is a new covenant this is a new thing
[1:12:12] that god is saying i'm doing
[1:12:14] right and remember what god blesses
[1:12:17] can't be reversed
[1:12:19] this is my blood or the new of the new
[1:12:21] covenant which is shed for many
[1:12:23] for the remission of sins
[1:12:26] so again just pulling in the body
[1:12:30] here so we have christ telling his
[1:12:32] disciples to drink of something that is
[1:12:34] representative of his blood
[1:12:36] it's the life-giving source which is the
[1:12:38] blood
[1:12:39] of his body he says
[1:12:42] his blood is shed for remission of sins
[1:12:44] now i something about the human body
[1:12:46] that's fascinated me
[1:12:48] is i can't remember the name of the
[1:12:51] position in the medical field but when
[1:12:52] they're doing a a
[1:12:54] an open heart they actually shut down
[1:12:57] the heart
[1:12:58] they they they bypass the lungs
[1:13:01] and all they do is they run the blood
[1:13:04] through a machine
[1:13:05] that puts some oxygen in it and it just
[1:13:07] keeps cycling it
[1:13:09] and it's running through your body so
[1:13:10] this thing essentially becomes the heart
[1:13:13] but they shut down the breathing
[1:13:16] they shut down basically everything else
[1:13:18] the only thing keeping you alive
[1:13:20] the life-giving resource is the blood
[1:13:23] amen so the life is in the blood take
[1:13:26] all the blood out of you
[1:13:27] and you're dead there's no life there
[1:13:30] right
[1:13:30] so you understand it it had to be blood
[1:13:33] it's the life-giving resource it's so
[1:13:37] jesus is saying i'm going to shed my
[1:13:39] blood and this is going to be for
[1:13:40] remission of sins
[1:13:44] so it's it's it's a it's a in and in
[1:13:46] communion it's a symbol it's it's that
[1:13:48] you're identified with christ
[1:13:50] partakers of him with the body in other
[1:13:52] words you're identified or showing
[1:13:54] you're plugged into christ in his body
[1:13:56] where the life is
[1:13:57] bringing everything under the blood and
[1:13:59] brother branham said it's a showdown
[1:14:01] nothing standing between you and the
[1:14:02] savior
[1:14:04] but we we realized i'm just saying that
[1:14:06] to say how important the blood is
[1:14:08] in in this remission of sins okay
[1:14:11] remission is a release from bondage
[1:14:15] or imprisonment it's a release from it
[1:14:19] it's forgiveness or pardon of sins it's
[1:14:22] letting them go
[1:14:23] as if they had never been committed
[1:14:26] watch the power of the blood
[1:14:28] watch this blessing that's been
[1:14:30] pronounced on you
[1:14:32] by jesus christ himself that cannot be
[1:14:34] reversed
[1:14:37] it's forgiveness it's pardon it's
[1:14:39] letting it go as if it was never
[1:14:40] committed it's remission of the penalty
[1:14:42] it's deliverance
[1:14:43] it's liberty it's divorcement
[1:14:46] of sin divorcement
[1:14:50] it means that sin has expired
[1:14:54] it's dead and it's not
[1:14:57] it's it's to not discuss the topic
[1:15:00] now i want catch this now i hope you're
[1:15:04] catching what i'm saying
[1:15:05] this is the blood the power of the blood
[1:15:07] of jesus christ in your life that god
[1:15:10] said
[1:15:10] i'm going to die my blood is for
[1:15:13] remission of sins
[1:15:15] and when you believe that this is the
[1:15:18] benefit that you get
[1:15:20] your debt that you could not pay
[1:15:24] has been completely washed away
[1:15:28] and not only that but god's saying i
[1:15:30] don't want to talk about it no more
[1:15:32] this is a topic that we're not going to
[1:15:34] discuss anymore
[1:15:37] so that's why brother branham could
[1:15:38] bring out that this goes in the sea of
[1:15:41] god's forgetfulness
[1:15:43] this is justification just as if you
[1:15:45] never did it in the first place
[1:15:47] and god is saying i don't want to talk
[1:15:49] about it
[1:15:51] so we we satan continually brings it up
[1:15:54] and then we continually bring it up to
[1:15:56] god and god's saying hey
[1:15:58] i don't want to talk about it it's under
[1:16:00] the blood forget it
[1:16:04] the italians say forget about it
[1:16:08] i don't want to talk about it no more
[1:16:10] and
[1:16:11] and it's a it's a divorcement now one
[1:16:13] thing that i thought about when i was
[1:16:15] when you know i was studying this is
[1:16:17] divorce you know nowadays
[1:16:19] divorce is just not what it used to be
[1:16:23] divorce and and if you've been divorced
[1:16:26] there's situations that come up and
[1:16:28] and i'm i'm sorry sorry for you
[1:16:32] and and and i just i i really am my
[1:16:35] my parents are divorced and it's it's an
[1:16:37] awful thing
[1:16:39] but divorcement nowadays
[1:16:42] seems to be some strange thing where you
[1:16:45] still stay in contact you're still
[1:16:47] buddies
[1:16:48] um you still get along because you've
[1:16:50] been married all that time
[1:16:52] but yet you're divorced and i don't
[1:16:54] understand that
[1:16:57] but it's why why get divorced in the
[1:17:00] first place
[1:17:03] but when this divorcement that god's
[1:17:06] talking about
[1:17:07] is a complete cutoff it's it's death
[1:17:10] it's just
[1:17:11] it's it's a you know divorce is a death
[1:17:14] that never dies nowadays
[1:17:15] because it's something you always you
[1:17:17] always go through there's always
[1:17:19] situations come up where you do have to
[1:17:21] maybe communicate or something and
[1:17:22] it's just it never ends
[1:17:26] but death you might mourn that person
[1:17:29] but there's but there's
[1:17:32] i think how to say this there's a little
[1:17:36] bit of closure to it
[1:17:38] right and so this is the divorcement
[1:17:40] that god's talking about
[1:17:42] is it give up a debt to neglect that
[1:17:45] uh it's it's not to hinder it's to
[1:17:47] depart and leave so all mutual claims
[1:17:50] are abandoned
[1:17:51] satan has no claim over you when you
[1:17:53] when you apply the blood
[1:17:55] that there is no sharing of you at that
[1:17:57] point god says they're all mine
[1:18:00] this is the blessing that i've spoken
[1:18:01] over them and i don't want to hear about
[1:18:03] it
[1:18:05] it's it's it's a break of it says satan
[1:18:08] you have no claim on them any longer
[1:18:11] it's to go away and leave
[1:18:13] someone behind not taking him as a
[1:18:15] companion
[1:18:16] you know if you if you if you've sinned
[1:18:18] in your past you've done something
[1:18:20] awful and you've repented and brought it
[1:18:22] under the blood
[1:18:24] leave that companion back there walk on
[1:18:26] with christ
[1:18:27] don't take him with you quit carrying
[1:18:29] the load jesus listen
[1:18:31] god is giving you permission to let it
[1:18:34] go
[1:18:36] he's given you permission to let it go
[1:18:43] hebrews 9 22 and without shedding of
[1:18:45] blood is no remission
[1:18:47] and then scofield writes the sin of the
[1:18:50] justified believer
[1:18:51] interrupts his fellowship it does
[1:18:52] interrupt fellowship if there's sin in
[1:18:54] your life
[1:18:55] then you can't have complete fellowship
[1:18:57] the way god wants to have fellowship
[1:19:00] but is forgiven upon confession
[1:19:04] always on the ground of christ
[1:19:06] propitiation sacrifice now
[1:19:08] i'm going to get into some scriptures
[1:19:10] are you still with me i have no clue
[1:19:11] what time it is
[1:19:12] boy we've been going a long time
[1:19:17] um i want you to catch a couple things
[1:19:21] though
[1:19:22] first john 1 verse 6.
[1:19:34] first john 1 verse 6.
[1:19:43] okay if we say that we have fellowship
[1:19:47] with god and walk in darkness we lie and
[1:19:50] do not the truth
[1:19:51] but if we walk in the light as he is in
[1:19:53] the light we have fellowship one with
[1:19:55] another
[1:19:55] and the blood of jesus christ his son
[1:19:58] cleanseth us
[1:19:58] from all sin not from some of your sin
[1:20:02] from all of your sin if we say that we
[1:20:06] have no sin
[1:20:07] we deceive ourselves and the truth is
[1:20:09] not in us if we confess our sins
[1:20:12] he is faithful and just to forgive us
[1:20:14] our sins and to cleanse us from all
[1:20:16] unrighteousness
[1:20:17] if we say that we have not sinned we
[1:20:19] make him a liar and his word is not in
[1:20:21] us now
[1:20:21] that's not saying that's not reversing
[1:20:23] what i'm saying
[1:20:25] that's saying i i that's acknowledging i
[1:20:28] am a sinner
[1:20:29] and i do need the blood of jesus christ
[1:20:31] if you didn't sin then there's no use
[1:20:33] for the blood
[1:20:34] but if you acknowledge that yes i have
[1:20:37] sin and i do need the blood of jesus
[1:20:38] christ is what he's saying
[1:20:40] then he goes on he says my little
[1:20:43] children these things
[1:20:44] write i unto you that ye sin not and if
[1:20:46] any man sin we have an advocate with the
[1:20:49] father
[1:20:49] jesus christ the righteous and he is the
[1:20:52] propitiation for our sins
[1:20:55] and not for ours only but also for the
[1:20:57] sins of the whole world
[1:20:59] so notice the reach and the depth that
[1:21:01] this blood goes
[1:21:04] amen and i want to just grab verse 12.
[1:21:07] i write unto you little children because
[1:21:10] your sins
[1:21:11] are forgiven you for why
[1:21:15] for his name's sake god didn't just set
[1:21:18] this up
[1:21:19] based on good behavior okay i'll forgive
[1:21:22] them
[1:21:23] and then they sin and okay now you're
[1:21:26] out
[1:21:26] then you repent okay you're back in no
[1:21:29] he's he put some skin in the game
[1:21:32] he said i'm gonna set this up based on
[1:21:34] what i'm doing for you
[1:21:36] i'm gonna set it up because this is my
[1:21:38] name at stake
[1:21:40] so you have you have i just want you to
[1:21:43] catch us this morning you have such an
[1:21:44] outstanding blessing over your life
[1:21:48] that i don't care how you feel about
[1:21:51] yourself
[1:21:52] i i do but i don't it doesn't matter in
[1:21:55] the end
[1:21:56] it doesn't matter what the devil says to
[1:21:59] you it doesn't matter what other people
[1:22:01] have said to you
[1:22:02] or about you you have such a blessing
[1:22:05] over your life and it cannot be reversed
[1:22:10] amen boy i've got a lot on my fork yeah
[1:22:17] proverbs 24 16 for a just
[1:22:20] man falls seven times and rises up
[1:22:24] again but the wicked shall fall into
[1:22:26] mischief
[1:22:28] so the justified man doesn't matter how
[1:22:32] many times you fall
[1:22:33] get back up get back up
[1:22:37] get back up if you fall get back up
[1:22:40] it doesn't matter how many times you
[1:22:42] fall jesus what i just shared with you
[1:22:44] jesus does not keep record of that
[1:22:46] he only sees you standing that's the
[1:22:50] only way he wants to see you is to see
[1:22:52] you standing
[1:22:53] amen now brother do you got that
[1:22:57] picture
[1:23:04] i want to show you something and then
[1:23:05] we'll expound on this because
[1:23:08] this is really something i believe that
[1:23:11] that satan has done
[1:23:15] through so brother branham talks about
[1:23:18] the doctrine of balaam the scripture
[1:23:20] talks about that
[1:23:21] brother branham expounds on it for us
[1:23:24] right so revelation speaks of the
[1:23:26] doctrine of balaam
[1:23:28] but brother branham said that you can't
[1:23:30] you know nicolaitanism is
[1:23:31] is conquering the laity it's a group of
[1:23:34] men a hierarchy
[1:23:35] see that's why that's why the workforce
[1:23:37] doesn't work in the church
[1:23:39] there is no hierarchy now i say that the
[1:23:42] pastor is the pastor
[1:23:44] right every church is sovereign so don't
[1:23:47] say i'm saying anything
[1:23:48] different but i'm just saying it's it's
[1:23:50] this hierarchy that men
[1:23:52] puts up and and it's it's to have rule
[1:23:55] over people and and
[1:23:58] you know we find it in the catholic
[1:24:00] church we find it in the different
[1:24:01] denominations but it's not to enter
[1:24:03] that's not the way that god wanted it
[1:24:05] set up
[1:24:07] and so you have this doctrine of the
[1:24:10] nicolaitanism
[1:24:11] which means to conquer the laity and
[1:24:12] then you have so once you conquer the
[1:24:15] laity you have to have a tool to do it
[1:24:16] by
[1:24:17] and it's the doctrine of balaam it's
[1:24:19] it's man's ideas
[1:24:21] it's man injecting it's man it's man
[1:24:24] adding and taking away from the word to
[1:24:26] to
[1:24:26] to have this conquering authority over
[1:24:28] the people to hold them
[1:24:30] it's what satan does to you in your mind
[1:24:32] it's the battle of the mind that's
[1:24:33] exactly what the doctrine of balaam is
[1:24:35] is to get you think something
[1:24:37] about yourself other than what the word
[1:24:39] says
[1:24:41] so man has taken this thought of penance
[1:24:45] and and this is a man-made thing this is
[1:24:48] a man-made doctrine it's a doctrine of
[1:24:50] balaam
[1:24:51] that man has to do something in order to
[1:24:55] gain
[1:24:55] acceptance with god in order to gain
[1:24:58] forgiveness of sins
[1:24:59] but we just read in the word that when
[1:25:01] you confess your sins he's faithful and
[1:25:03] just to forgive you your sins
[1:25:06] he doesn't say that you have to go and
[1:25:08] walk from the back of the building
[1:25:10] up to the front on your knees he doesn't
[1:25:12] say that you have to go
[1:25:14] stand up on your head up against the
[1:25:16] wall
[1:25:18] he doesn't say that you have to go light
[1:25:20] a candle or that you have to go burn
[1:25:21] incense
[1:25:22] he doesn't say there's blessings when
[1:25:25] you pay your tithes
[1:25:26] but you don't it's not even something
[1:25:28] that that i
[1:25:29] i want to say this right but it's not
[1:25:31] something that god requires of you
[1:25:34] for your salvation you cannot buy your
[1:25:36] way into heaven
[1:25:39] give that's great that's charity you
[1:25:41] should do that
[1:25:43] but don't expect god to gain favor with
[1:25:46] god because
[1:25:47] you give a lot of money if you give a
[1:25:50] million dollars
[1:25:52] if you had a million dollars and you put
[1:25:55] a million dollars in the tithe plate
[1:25:57] especially so everyone can see not i
[1:25:59] know it's just you're on the front row
[1:26:01] brother
[1:26:03] and and you know jesus used a sister
[1:26:05] that gave what was it two pennies
[1:26:08] and he said she gave more than all of
[1:26:09] you
[1:26:11] so if this sister gave two pennies
[1:26:15] to the brother next to you is million
[1:26:17] dollars
[1:26:21] there there's no difference it doesn't
[1:26:23] this one doesn't give
[1:26:24] favor because he gave more money it's
[1:26:27] the condition of the heart that god's
[1:26:29] looking at
[1:26:30] in the giving but god's looking at the
[1:26:32] blood
[1:26:34] amen so this thing of penance now i was
[1:26:37] talking
[1:26:38] with in some fellowship and a brother
[1:26:40] said he said there's no penance
[1:26:43] in true repentance and so i got to
[1:26:45] looking at the word and it just
[1:26:47] it just something god dropped in my
[1:26:48] heart i believe and this is what came to
[1:26:50] my mind
[1:26:52] and you see the word penance you can
[1:26:54] take the letters out
[1:26:56] and make it say penance but what do you
[1:26:58] have to remove to get there
[1:27:01] you have to remove the cross you have to
[1:27:04] remove the word of god you have to
[1:27:06] remove
[1:27:07] the blood amen
[1:27:10] in order to get a man-made doctrine of
[1:27:12] penance
[1:27:13] so i'm telling you this morning i want
[1:27:16] you to be free
[1:27:17] from any bondage from any anything that
[1:27:21] satan
[1:27:21] or man has put on you because this is
[1:27:24] the truth of the matter
[1:27:26] that there is no penance and repentance
[1:27:29] penance gets us looking at ourselves and
[1:27:31] makes us look back
[1:27:32] rather than looking forward repentance
[1:27:35] gets us looking at
[1:27:36] christ into and and to get up and keep
[1:27:39] pressing toward the mark of the high
[1:27:41] calling of god
[1:27:42] in christ jesus any spirit that would
[1:27:46] require penance of you is an antichrist
[1:27:48] spirit
[1:27:49] and i'll say that as loud and boldly as
[1:27:52] i can
[1:27:52] that is an antichrist spirit
[1:27:56] god hates what balaam did even told
[1:28:00] him god told him the angel of the lord
[1:28:03] stood before the donkey
[1:28:04] and he said your way is perverse before
[1:28:07] me
[1:28:09] he told balaam that
[1:28:12] anything that takes man away from the
[1:28:14] truth of the matter
[1:28:15] is despicable in the sight of god
[1:28:19] so don't listen to man who puts you
[1:28:22] under a doctrine of penance
[1:28:24] it's false teaching
[1:28:28] if our heart condemns us god is greater
[1:28:31] than our heart
[1:28:32] that's first john 3 20. then it says if
[1:28:35] the son of
[1:28:36] uh if the son therefore shall make you
[1:28:38] free
[1:28:39] you shall be free indeed john 8 36
[1:28:43] can are you still with me a little bit
[1:28:45] longer it's 12
[1:28:47] 30 so i think i've gone exactly an hour
[1:28:52] brother said this is the message of the
[1:28:54] hour
[1:28:59] just a little bit longer i promise i'll
[1:29:01] go quick
[1:29:04] god is not a god of guilt i just
[1:29:07] this is this is what god laid on my
[1:29:09] heart as i'm getting to the meat of it
[1:29:11] now
[1:29:11] after now if i was a better preacher
[1:29:13] maybe
[1:29:15] god is not a god of guilt he's not a god
[1:29:17] looking to make life more difficult this
[1:29:19] is something god's been speaking to me
[1:29:21] personally
[1:29:22] he don't god's not out to make life more
[1:29:24] difficult and make you live under a
[1:29:26] cloud of confusion and condemnation
[1:29:29] and guilt and fear he said he came that
[1:29:32] you might have
[1:29:33] life and have it more abundantly and i
[1:29:36] and i don't know how to say that too
[1:29:37] much different than what i just did
[1:29:39] but it i i just want to i
[1:29:42] i just that's what my heart is beating
[1:29:45] at right now amen
[1:29:47] is god is not a god who makes you feel
[1:29:50] guilty
[1:29:52] he's not a god who beats you over the
[1:29:54] head he's not a god who set
[1:29:55] some some hierarchy or some system in
[1:29:59] place
[1:29:59] that that you just can't live up to that
[1:30:02] is not what god had in mind
[1:30:04] that's why i'm trying to tell you that
[1:30:06] god died he shed his blood
[1:30:08] so that you could have a blessing that
[1:30:10] cannot be reversed
[1:30:12] and and it's just our fleshly in our
[1:30:15] flesh and our thinking
[1:30:17] and and sometimes our expectations of
[1:30:19] one another
[1:30:20] that just it just makes us think this
[1:30:23] way
[1:30:25] listen a lot of people and brother
[1:30:27] branham said he thought this way too a
[1:30:28] lot of people
[1:30:30] still today say well god is an angry god
[1:30:34] of the old testament but jesus loves me
[1:30:37] but if you know your scripture and if
[1:30:40] you'll pray for revelation
[1:30:41] you'll see that god and jesus are the
[1:30:43] same
[1:30:44] god just changed who he was he changed
[1:30:47] his mask as it were
[1:30:49] he came in the flesh they're the same
[1:30:50] the holy spirit it's not three persons
[1:30:53] it's three offices i am a father
[1:30:56] i am a son and i'm a husband it's the
[1:30:59] same thing with god i am one person not
[1:31:01] three
[1:31:02] amen i know you know that here but i'm
[1:31:05] just
[1:31:06] it it's it's just you can't separate god
[1:31:09] like that and then brother branham comes
[1:31:11] and he brings the revelation
[1:31:13] jehovah of the old is jesus of the new
[1:31:16] year it's the same person so so
[1:31:19] god who may have appeared angry at times
[1:31:21] listen i just read to you in numbers and
[1:31:23] god is giving a blessing
[1:31:26] that that's not an angry god that's a
[1:31:29] god who loves his people and who's for
[1:31:31] them amen
[1:31:36] so we can't hold things over our own
[1:31:38] head and we can't hold things
[1:31:40] over other's head god never demanded
[1:31:43] sinless
[1:31:44] perfection now i know that i knew it
[1:31:47] would get quiet right there
[1:31:49] god does not demand sinless perfection
[1:31:51] out of you
[1:31:53] he had to provide the way
[1:31:57] that is a man-made doctrine when god
[1:32:00] said be
[1:32:00] perfect as my father is perfect that
[1:32:03] perfect is not the perfection that this
[1:32:05] world has set up
[1:32:07] or that man in balaam's doctrine has set
[1:32:09] up
[1:32:10] that means he's speaking of a growth
[1:32:14] and it's a growth into maturity he's
[1:32:17] speaking of adoption when he says that
[1:32:19] he's not telling you you have to be
[1:32:21] perfect today if you're not perfect
[1:32:23] until you're perfect
[1:32:25] god doesn't accept you that's not what
[1:32:28] jesus said
[1:32:29] he said he said my children my brothers
[1:32:32] he called them friends and john
[1:32:34] listen this is what's so beautiful
[1:32:36] that's why i read john 15
[1:32:38] is because he said i'm i'm not calling
[1:32:40] you servants anymore i'm calling you
[1:32:42] friends because i'm revealing
[1:32:43] everything that the father is saying to
[1:32:45] you and this is a revelation that god
[1:32:47] has revealed
[1:32:48] that you don't you don't have to live
[1:32:50] under condemnation
[1:32:52] you know i he says i've done this it's
[1:32:55] it's a it's a it's a growth it's i'm not
[1:32:58] demanding perfection from you i've
[1:33:00] provided the perfection for you
[1:33:02] all you have to do is walk in it amen
[1:33:07] he said he would never put on us more
[1:33:09] than we can bear he'll never
[1:33:11] ask of you more than what he can supply
[1:33:14] we say well that it's just too great
[1:33:16] this trial is too great and we and we
[1:33:18] kind of keep
[1:33:18] in that mindset and that's how we look
[1:33:20] at that scripture but really
[1:33:23] god can put as much on you as long as he
[1:33:25] provides for you what you need
[1:33:27] amen he said let us go over from point a
[1:33:31] to point b from one thing to another
[1:33:34] from glory
[1:33:34] to glory and not one will be plucked
[1:33:37] from my hand
[1:33:43] let me just jump here if the musicians
[1:33:46] want to come
[1:33:52] listen when we look at this this
[1:33:54] doctrine of balaam where it's brought up
[1:33:55] and god says i hate it
[1:33:58] is in revelations when he's talking
[1:34:00] about the church ages
[1:34:02] and just showing that god will always
[1:34:04] provide the way
[1:34:06] he's always made a way he it's it's
[1:34:08] based on
[1:34:09] what he's done not what you've done when
[1:34:12] he says that
[1:34:12] in the church ages he also says to him
[1:34:15] that overcometh
[1:34:17] and it's god providing the way through
[1:34:19] he didn't say that as a distant god
[1:34:22] looking down
[1:34:23] on the uttermost parts it's
[1:34:26] he says it when he's walking in the
[1:34:28] midst of the candlesticks
[1:34:30] he's right there he's right with us
[1:34:33] walking
[1:34:33] through the age he's right there with us
[1:34:36] his blood is still on the throne
[1:34:38] his blood is still on the mercy seat
[1:34:40] despite what anyone would say
[1:34:42] god is still his blood is still just as
[1:34:46] powerful today as it ever has been
[1:35:00] i want to catch one
[1:35:03] i'll read those last two quotes real
[1:35:05] quick brothers
[1:35:12] it says all right the church seems to
[1:35:14] have almost
[1:35:15] completely been cut off just a little
[1:35:17] dwindle talking about through the church
[1:35:19] age
[1:35:21] and they had got away from the great
[1:35:23] spiritual meetings and were kind of
[1:35:25] relying upon works
[1:35:27] god don't want us to rely upon works
[1:35:30] that's a sign of organism organization
[1:35:33] we take miss jones over some wood and
[1:35:35] we'll take so and so their children over
[1:35:37] some clothes and that's all right
[1:35:39] but don't you depend on that don't you
[1:35:42] do that brother
[1:35:43] that's good deeds a good citizen a good
[1:35:46] decent citizen will do that
[1:35:48] but what it takes to be a christian is a
[1:35:50] born-again experience
[1:35:52] the baptism of the holy ghost all right
[1:35:55] dwindled off they was resorted to works
[1:35:59] instead of love and faith
[1:36:01] getting them more and more all the time
[1:36:02] as it went on
[1:36:04] i've got some scriptures here that i'm
[1:36:06] just don't don't have time
[1:36:08] to read but you know the scripture by by
[1:36:10] faith are you saved
[1:36:13] not of works lest any man should boast
[1:36:16] but it's by grace it's by faith and what
[1:36:18] god's done for you
[1:36:20] amen paul wrote to the galatians who
[1:36:25] hath bewitched you
[1:36:29] that ye should not obey the truth before
[1:36:31] whose eyes jesus christ hath been
[1:36:32] evidently set forth crucified among you
[1:36:36] this only what i learned of you receive
[1:36:38] ye the spirit by the works of the law or
[1:36:41] by the hearing of faith
[1:36:44] it's not by the law it's by faith
[1:36:47] [Music]
[1:36:48] and how do you get faith you say brother
[1:36:50] i just don't have the faith
[1:36:52] faith cometh by hearing and hearing by
[1:36:54] the word of god
[1:36:56] that's why i tell you i'm not trying to
[1:36:59] to
[1:36:59] attach you to some church or to some to
[1:37:02] brother sam
[1:37:03] or some other minister or anything but
[1:37:06] i'm trying to attach you to jesus christ
[1:37:08] and you come
[1:37:09] because this is where the word is
[1:37:10] preached and if the word is preached
[1:37:13] your faith will be lifted
[1:37:14] that's just how god set it up
[1:37:20] amen let's skip that last quote i just
[1:37:23] feel to stop there so i i pray this was
[1:37:27] a blessing to you
[1:37:28] and i pray that you could see because
[1:37:30] it's just
[1:37:33] laying maybe a long foundation but that
[1:37:35] especially that last part is just what
[1:37:37] started burning in my heart for you
[1:37:39] this this morning is just to really
[1:37:44] to really see that anything that makes
[1:37:46] you rely on works
[1:37:49] is a doctrine of man and and i'm telling
[1:37:52] you
[1:37:52] if you don't believe me go read get your
[1:37:54] bible and do a little study
[1:37:56] because god says i hate that i hate the
[1:38:00] thing that takes you off of the true
[1:38:02] word of god
[1:38:04] amen you can stand to your feet
[1:38:07] and i sure sure appreciate you
[1:38:12] and i and i know brother sam would be
[1:38:14] very happy with the things
[1:38:15] way things operate here and you always
[1:38:18] make me feel real welcome
[1:38:19] and and i just really appreciate you all
[1:38:23] and you're
[1:38:24] you can see the desire to serve god in
[1:38:26] your eyes
[1:38:28] each one of you so i don't know what
[1:38:30] you're going through
[1:38:31] i don't know what you've been through i
[1:38:34] don't know what your past is
[1:38:35] i do care for you so when i say i don't
[1:38:37] care i don't i don't mean it
[1:38:39] that way but what i'm trying to say is
[1:38:43] it's remitted
[1:38:47] if it's not bring it under the blood get
[1:38:50] it under the blood this morning
[1:38:51] listen you don't don't come confess it
[1:38:53] to me
[1:38:54] i'm not the mediator confess it to god
[1:38:58] he's the one that his his what he did
[1:39:02] he's the one it's his blood on the cross
[1:39:05] it's his blood that stands between that
[1:39:08] mad main thing of penance
[1:39:10] and makes it repentance something he
[1:39:12] doesn't want to talk about
[1:39:13] anymore so get it under the blood and
[1:39:16] move on
[1:39:17] that seems so easy but
[1:39:21] it it is yes it is it's just this flesh
[1:39:24] that gets in the way
[1:39:26] [Music]
[1:39:29] i'm not a good singer so i'm gonna i'm
[1:39:31] gonna say my prayer here
[1:39:33] and turn the service over but if you
[1:39:36] need prayer i'm happy to pray with you
[1:39:38] i'm happy to put my faith with yours if
[1:39:41] if you
[1:39:42] you know don't don't come confess to me
[1:39:45] what you did wrong
[1:39:46] but if you need me to pray with you i'd
[1:39:48] be happy to do that
[1:39:50] amen let's bow our hearts together lord
[1:39:53] jesus
[1:39:54] we come before you and lord it's it's a
[1:39:58] sacred thing for me god
[1:40:00] for a minister to to hand over his
[1:40:03] congregation for a service
[1:40:05] that means to me a world
[1:40:08] because he has confidence and trust in
[1:40:11] me
[1:40:12] not in me but the gift in me lord and i
[1:40:14] just pray that i've surrendered and i've
[1:40:16] yielded
[1:40:17] to you fully so that you could speak i
[1:40:21] just still feel that
[1:40:22] last part burning in my heart god
[1:40:25] and and i just pray lord maybe i should
[1:40:28] have
[1:40:28] spent more time on it i didn't realize
[1:40:30] i'd spend so much time on the first part
[1:40:32] but
[1:40:33] i just pray that your word would go
[1:40:35] forward
[1:40:36] lord even maybe things that i i didn't
[1:40:38] get to read lord that you would just
[1:40:41] lord reveal to your people that you
[1:40:43] would just settle in our hearts god i
[1:40:45] need it too lord i'm not
[1:40:47] i'm not preaching something i'm not
[1:40:49] living
[1:40:51] lord or something i'm living higher than
[1:40:54] but i need it too lord i know you know
[1:40:57] my my nature and makeup more than even i
[1:40:59] do
[1:41:00] and i need these things lord just drop
[1:41:02] this revelation into every heart
[1:41:05] lord there's a lot of different
[1:41:07] situations on in here i know about
[1:41:10] and so i just pray lord that you would
[1:41:13] lord there may be some fighting what's
[1:41:15] been said this morning
[1:41:18] there may be many saying that that can't
[1:41:20] be true
[1:41:21] that doesn't apply to me but father
[1:41:25] you know god every name on that book
[1:41:29] and i pray that you would reveal to them
[1:41:31] lord this morning that their name is on
[1:41:33] it
[1:41:35] for that's what jesus you said to the
[1:41:38] disciples when they came back rejoicing
[1:41:40] saying we cast out devils and things
[1:41:44] he said don't rejoice of that but
[1:41:46] rejoice because your name is on the book
[1:41:49] if anyone is downtrodden this morning
[1:41:51] lord
[1:41:53] under that cloud of of shadow of the
[1:41:55] enemy
[1:41:57] then i pray god that you would show them
[1:42:00] that there are blessed people
[1:42:01] [Music]
[1:42:03] show them that revelation this morning
[1:42:05] in jesus christ's name
