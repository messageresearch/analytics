[32:47] [Music]
[32:56] forgiven
[33:00] ESS
[33:03] been washed
[33:08] [Music]
[33:11] praise the Lord Jesus
[33:14] good to be a Christian isn't it
[33:17] it's good to serve the Living God what a
[33:20] privilege he's given us Amen in this
[33:22] hour amen we are our very privileged
[33:25] people
[33:26] amen and we don't take that lightly it's
[33:28] not
[33:30] like anything that we have done I think
[33:32] of how that God
[33:34] would speak in the book of Deuteronomy
[33:36] to Israel reminding
[33:38] them of what he did in bringing them out
[33:41] of Egypt God was letting him know you
[33:43] know because there was
[33:46] those that brought back an evil report
[33:48] and Israel wandered for 40 years in the
[33:52] wilderness it still it didn't diminish
[33:55] the promise of God one bit
[34:00] when God makes a promise God keeps his
[34:04] promise
[34:06] and I'm grateful for that
[34:09] because we can all Fellowship around
[34:11] this thought we've had our thoughts our
[34:13] ideas or whatever but in the midst of it
[34:16] all because you see the same thing in
[34:17] Abraham you see it all the way through
[34:19] that's just not an isolated event but it
[34:22] shows to you and I
[34:24] and what a rest this brings to us is the
[34:27] prevailing power
[34:29] of Revelation that God will and he does
[34:33] fulfill every word
[34:36] and I don't care how much unbelief Paul
[34:38] writes of this in the Book of Romans
[34:40] will unbelief hinder God no
[34:44] though many did not believe will it
[34:46] hinder got no no it's not going to stop
[34:48] God
[34:49] God is moving with a purpose
[34:52] and so then when we we come into that
[34:54] place God would remind Israel
[34:58] that the reason you're here
[35:01] is not because you and yourself are
[35:04] better than somebody else but he lets
[35:06] them know the reason you're here and
[35:08] what I've done is because a promise I
[35:10] made to your fathers and what was that
[35:13] promise that's his word
[35:16] and he is the word is that right that's
[35:18] why brother Bram says that when anything
[35:20] comes up and he's taking us from Moses
[35:22] where Moses stood there and when the
[35:24] people had sinned and Moses did Moses
[35:28] put himself
[35:29] in the breach for the people
[35:32] now who was that it took more than a man
[35:35] because of a man before ran
[35:37] is that right when when they when they
[35:40] came against Moses down in Egypt he ran
[35:42] but there was something different about
[35:43] Moses life now it was Christ
[35:47] in Moses
[35:49] I tell you I this is this is you know to
[35:52] say well brother Sammy this might be
[35:53] your thought or your idea no I believe
[35:55] this is the word of God you talking
[35:57] about a one great display of Redemptive
[35:59] Grace I
[36:01] that right there
[36:03] is one I would rather have in my heart
[36:05] and in every heart here than if we could
[36:08] sit here and testify I walked on the
[36:10] water I did this I did that but if we
[36:11] can have her my heart I stood in the gap
[36:15] how can we stand in the gap
[36:19] because it must be Christ in us standing
[36:22] he stood for us now he and us we yield
[36:26] to him and he stands
[36:28] amen
[36:30] and that's why coming back to that place
[36:32] brother ramp said see when God has made
[36:34] a promise in his word he said like Moses
[36:37] Moses put God's word right in his
[36:39] pathway God was going to come down and
[36:42] smite Israel but he said God Moses put
[36:45] the word in God's pathway and God will
[36:48] never overstep his word
[36:51] why I'm gone and I change not he comes
[36:55] to fulfill it not overstep it not bypass
[36:58] it no matter what is going on no matter
[37:00] what situations where others could in
[37:03] this age that God would speak and
[37:05] require and speak to you and I of a
[37:08] brotherly kindness of a perfect love in
[37:11] an age when hatred is so rampant
[37:14] right
[37:16] but who can do it you and I would not
[37:17] have wrote the surrounding backgrounds
[37:20] for this to be the setting for that to
[37:23] be made manifest
[37:24] but the Difference Maker is who it is in
[37:27] US
[37:28] doing it
[37:30] that's all the difference in the world
[37:33] amen don't you love him this morning
[37:36] amen and amen so I want to just mention
[37:40] to you today is that the Christian
[37:42] family event the RSVP if you haven't
[37:45] signed up out there on the on the table
[37:48] please do that at the end of the service
[37:50] because at that point then I have to
[37:52] take it and we've got to I've got to
[37:54] process through a lot of things before
[37:56] then I start
[37:57] um opening it in in for the other
[38:00] churches because as I told you before I
[38:02] just can't we can't uh just wide open it
[38:06] uh open it wide because there's only
[38:09] seed we're only going to be seated for
[38:12] 200 and there's got to be working room
[38:14] in there and that's what we've spoke to
[38:16] them and so keeping it in that manner
[38:20] um also the fellowship dinner
[38:22] and before I make that a comment um the
[38:25] Christian family event the reason when
[38:27] brother Barry and I just took the
[38:29] guidelines that he had given within that
[38:30] and asked them the questions on who
[38:32] should be there and I think I mentioned
[38:34] this to you uh over the past two weeks
[38:36] uh the reason is the that when we say in
[38:40] it should be a 20 years old and up and
[38:43] really with children because it's not
[38:45] it's not like an actual service and we
[38:48] just want you to be able to be attentive
[38:50] and interactive with things that are
[38:52] going on so we're not just running
[38:54] around like like at a fellowship which
[38:56] we all well I've done when I had little
[38:58] ones and some of you that have little
[39:00] ones and so if you're I mean if you have
[39:03] little ones that are running around if
[39:05] you uh wood if you can find a babysitter
[39:09] and that's why we've let it be known
[39:11] here weeks in advance to try to get that
[39:13] orchestrated because it's not going to
[39:16] be it's not going to be like a
[39:18] fellowship dinner but it's going to be
[39:19] an interactive and a working
[39:22] time that's there and you might say
[39:25] working time every one of you probably
[39:27] every one of us have been to things even
[39:29] on our jobs trainings right
[39:32] hello anybody ever been to trainings on
[39:34] that you didn't go to sleep on me
[39:35] already my timer's not even started yet
[39:38] this does not count
[39:39] [Laughter]
[39:42] but we've all been to that right
[39:44] yeah the only thing different about this
[39:46] is a lot different for if you were like
[39:48] me when I would go to the trainings and
[39:50] uh when I was teaching you know you when
[39:52] you're first I was the the new guy on
[39:53] the Block you you have to learn who to
[39:55] sit next to and who not to sit next to
[39:57] because you've got some people in there
[39:58] they want everybody else to be quiet
[40:00] like teachers everybody to be quiet when
[40:01] I'm teaching in the class if you're
[40:02] doing I'll send you the office and you
[40:04] want to get up and say why don't we send
[40:05] you to the superintendent's office
[40:08] because you can't seem to zip it when
[40:10] everybody else is presenting you know I
[40:12] I've looked at that so you learned to
[40:14] kind of who to sit next to and who not
[40:15] but there's been in trainings and things
[40:17] like that at times where there's you
[40:18] know your information and thing is going
[40:21] on and then it's broke out and then it's
[40:22] coming back and forth and um so we we
[40:26] are we just want to be able to do that
[40:28] we could have done it right here in the
[40:30] in the assembly and just allowed the
[40:32] ministering just to take place right
[40:33] here but we want it to be in that manner
[40:36] to wear that even where it's open with
[40:37] questions and answers and you can write
[40:39] anything down and that pertains to that
[40:42] that would be beneficial so we just want
[40:46] to say that the fellowship dinner will
[40:50] be on Sunday February 19th so that's two
[40:53] weeks from today Lord willing will have
[40:55] a fellowship dinner the email has been
[40:58] sent out for February and there's also
[41:00] upcoming events that have also been laid
[41:03] out in there for the calendar I'm not
[41:07] going to ask how many read your email
[41:09] and I know there's been a little bit of
[41:10] with that of the email sister Roseanne
[41:13] takes care of that for us but she's
[41:15] there's been a lot that she has uh been
[41:18] really juggling even with some
[41:19] Transitions and things like that so
[41:21] that's why that maybe in January we
[41:23] didn't get a calendar it was posted on
[41:25] the board in there so if there's
[41:27] anything at all hey these things we take
[41:30] a lot of pictures with them
[41:32] am I right
[41:34] I mean when I go to a parking garage at
[41:36] a hospital anymore as soon as I get out
[41:38] of the car
[41:39] level three snap
[41:42] that's the last thing I'm thinking about
[41:43] is where I parked at so that's what I do
[41:46] why you do that so I'm not going to be
[41:48] the last guy there walking over every
[41:49] floor that's why I do it
[41:51] so uh oh brother Sammy you come up with
[41:54] a good night no I borrowed that from
[41:55] somebody else but even if you you go in
[41:58] the in the restroom there and you see
[41:59] the calendar in there you can take a
[42:01] picture of that and then get the things
[42:02] into your uh calendar there so you're
[42:05] well aware of what's going on and I also
[42:07] want to say
[42:09] um to the the brothers I just I wish I
[42:13] could have been there I'd worked to try
[42:15] to set myself as much as I could to be
[42:17] there yesterday morning and I didn't
[42:19] want to text you at the time it I knew I
[42:21] wasn't going to be there because it was
[42:22] about 3 A.M Saturday morning and
[42:25] um Benjamin Had injured his his foot and
[42:29] so coming back out of emergency room and
[42:31] things and I just I wanted to be there

[42:47] don't know exactly who's responsible for
[42:49] that but I say God bless you amen
[42:51] because you say well how could that make
[42:53] your heart feel well same way when
[42:55] brother Branham in the beginning of the
[42:57] first Shalom message he preaches he was
[42:59] so thankful he said I see some of you
[43:01] have brought lunches here and you're
[43:03] going to fellowship with one another
[43:04] after the service oh he said that makes
[43:07] my heart feel good
[43:09] right
[43:10] amen well there wasn't a real strong
[43:12] Amen on that but uh
[43:15] but the grace of God helps us to
[43:18] overcome self doesn't it
[43:20] amen so I I like I said I just want to
[43:24] say to the brother and I appreciate that
[43:26] and Lord willing uh you know we'll be
[43:28] able to be there the next time because I
[43:30] certainly want I I certainly want to

[43:35] uh you for the brothers God bless you
[43:38] carry on amen carry on and say it's it's
[43:41] wonderful so without taking any more
[43:44] time and I've taken some unless if we
[43:47] could stand and we want to turn to the
[43:49] word of God
[43:50] and um
[43:54] we just want to turn our hearts here and
[43:59] just this morning
[44:00] amen
[44:05] brother Ryan is Maddie here today she is
[44:07] okay so it's good to have
[44:09] and I'm sure sister Rachel's here too so
[44:12] it's good to have
[44:14] uh brother Ryan sister Rachel and Maddie
[44:17] back here the this morning and so
[44:19] thankful for how God has just brought
[44:21] her through and good to see each and
[44:22] every one of you some of you from
[44:23] vacation I haven't seen some of your
[44:25] faces but it's good to be gathered here
[44:28] together amen John chapter 17 verse 20.
[44:34] Hallelujah
[44:36] neither
[44:37] pray I for these alone
[44:40] but for them also which Shall Believe on
[44:44] me
[44:45] through their word now we know that
[44:48] our word cannot be a different word but
[44:53] it must be his word that draws and
[44:56] causes Hearts to be moved toward him so
[44:59] neither pray I for these alone but for
[45:02] them also which Shall Believe on me
[45:04] through their word I was included in
[45:07] that prayer how about you
[45:11] and this is where it may be that they
[45:14] all may be one
[45:16] as thou father art in me and I indeed
[45:22] that they also may be one in us that the
[45:28] world may believe that thou Hast sent me
[45:34] and I want you to catch this this is the
[45:37] heart of God
[45:40] loves Unity
[45:43] God loves Unity but remember he likes
[45:47] Unity that's true
[45:50] remember he came down upon the Tower of
[45:54] Babel and smote all of that but what
[45:56] they were able to achieve by just being
[45:59] unified but I'm grateful there's a
[46:02] greater power than the intellect of man
[46:04] that's uniting us together it has to be
[46:07] look how different we are right look how
[46:10] much grace we need for one another is
[46:12] that right
[46:13] my verse 22. and the glory which thou
[46:17] gave us me
[46:19] I have given them
[46:22] so that Glory that has come that has
[46:25] unfolded in my life of that of who I am
[46:29] that they may be one even as we are one
[46:34] so that same Glory I've given them and
[46:36] here it is in verse 23 i in them
[46:40] and thou in me that they may be made
[46:43] perfect in one and that the world may
[46:46] know that thou has sent me and has loved
[46:49] them as thou has loved me
[46:52] thank you Lord let's just bow our heads
[46:54] just for a moment of Prayer
[46:56] Heavenly Father
[46:58] Lord we're gathered here this morning
[47:01] Lord
[47:02] and we're in need of your grace Lord
[47:05] we're in need Lord of you this morning
[47:09] that you would just Lord come Among Us
[47:13] Lord
[47:14] come to every every life and Lord Grace
[47:18] that Lord that every door might be open
[47:20] Lord and that you would just speak and
[47:23] Minister Lord to every need that's
[47:26] gathered here Lord father we need your
[47:29] grace this morning Lord we ask that you
[47:32] will come Lord and take control Lord in
[47:36] every in the furtherance of this service
[47:38] Lord as we give ourselves to you in
[47:41] Jesus precious name amen amen God bless
[47:44] you as you're being seated
[47:47] I want to just take back and read just a
[47:50] few
[47:51] places out of the message Oneness and I
[47:53] mentioned that to you last week that if
[47:55] you haven't listened to that message
[47:57] Oneness if you
[47:58] would do so that's drawing quite a bit
[48:02] from there
[48:03] but the theme runs through the whole
[48:05] message it runs through the whole Bible
[48:07] so it's it's the theme the theme doesn't
[48:10] change the theme is Jesus Christ the
[48:13] same yesterday today and forever that
[48:15] that doesn't mean that doesn't change
[48:17] the veils or The Masks the form the
[48:22] vessels change but he never changes
[48:25] so he's the theme all the way through it
[48:29] so then but the Brahman says Jesus
[48:32] prayed that the church and he would be
[48:34] one like he and the father were one that
[48:36] the church we as members of the body of
[48:39] Christ would be one together just like
[48:42] he and the father are one and then he
[48:45] quotes the scripture from John 14 and at
[48:47] that day we would know that he was in
[48:49] the Father the father in him and he and
[48:52] us that together we were one
[48:55] what a union a Oneness that would be to
[48:59] see God in his church till every member
[49:03] is just perfectly in harmony with each
[49:07] other and God that's the church that
[49:11] Jesus is coming for that's when his
[49:13] prayer will be answered that we will be
[49:17] one
[49:18] and I even as I read this here
[49:22] the only thing that can ReSound from my
[49:24] heart is is oh
[49:26] how it will take and is taking the grace
[49:30] of God
[49:31] to achieve this
[49:33] man cannot achieve this
[49:36] this is God's achievement
[49:40] but you say what is our part in it our
[49:42] part is to yield and allow him to do
[49:46] what he has ordained to do
[49:50] amen and I'll tell you it's supernatural
[49:53] you you know many times we think and we
[49:55] should uh and we consider the Red Sea we
[49:58] consider the Jordan but remember
[50:00] this Bible the Holy Spirit Has Lifted it
[50:03] from just a book of History which it
[50:06] does contain history history and lives
[50:09] and events but it makes it known that
[50:11] he's the same God of what he did there
[50:14] and sometimes we can look at it in our
[50:16] in our own life but remember the same
[50:18] God that opened the Red Sea that made
[50:20] them made a way where there wasn't no
[50:23] way where their back was up against the
[50:24] wall our backs were against the wall and
[50:27] if we can we really look at it in this
[50:30] manner that we need the same God
[50:32] continually moving in our life to open
[50:36] and to make a way because when it all
[50:39] comes down in our un individual life in
[50:43] the local body in the body around the
[50:45] world there's not one man not one person
[50:48] that can take credit for what has been
[50:51] done but it is all to the glory of
[50:54] almighty God
[50:56] remember those that will stand and say
[51:00] Lord didn't I do this didn't I do that
[51:03] that's after the Rapture that's standing
[51:06] at the white Throne judgment and
[51:09] presenting to God that this is why I'm
[51:12] worthy I preached I did this I did that
[51:16] but you see for the bride for his wife
[51:20] the I on Syria's name got taken off
[51:26] amen by the coming of the Glorious
[51:30] revelation of Elohim himself
[51:33] hey let me tell you there's nothing that
[51:35] could remove the eye out of you and I
[51:37] except the greater eye
[51:40] amen it's the only grounds of Fellowship
[51:44] that God has ever laid down for himself
[51:46] and his church is the Oneness of himself
[51:49] in the people that's the only grounds of
[51:53] fellowship and the only way that you can
[51:55] have those grounds is by Union to be
[51:58] United with him forever
[52:01] and we read this last week this is God's
[52:05] Oneness when the spirit that you got
[52:08] agrees with this word
[52:13] there's a lot we could preach just from
[52:15] on that part but it's more than you or I
[52:18] just standing here and saying yep
[52:21] everything I've not made any mistakes
[52:23] I'm not no but to agree with the word of
[52:26] God is where the spirit of God within us
[52:29] then it's lining with the word even when
[52:31] the word comes across to correct us it
[52:34] recognizes the word and agrees with it
[52:38] are you hearing me now
[52:40] and Manifest this word and makes this
[52:44] word power to act the same way it did
[52:48] there and brother Brian said let's say
[52:50] it together so let's let's do that let's
[52:52] say it together Oneness with God is to
[52:56] have God's spirit in you agreeing with
[53:00] the word all the word the whole word and
[53:04] to make it manifested in power I want to
[53:08] just deal with this desire and purpose
[53:10] because when Jesus is praying it's what
[53:14] a what a um uh a layout of how that we
[53:18] are to pray because remember the
[53:20] disciples even had asked him the time
[53:22] teach us how to pray and prayer itself
[53:25] was to be solemnly
[53:29] uh uh overshadowed with the desire for
[53:33] God's will to come down for his will to
[53:37] be done in our life that's what prayer
[53:39] was all about is thus submitting to the
[53:42] will of God and I know we have requests
[53:44] that we have to make we we have needs
[53:46] you we read requests right here before
[53:48] uh the assembly you take up the prayer
[53:51] request and you're praying and I'm
[53:53] praying and you know whether it's in our
[53:55] prayer closet even throughout the day is
[53:57] different needs texts and so forth so
[53:59] there's always requests and petitions
[54:02] that we have and needs and there's
[54:04] things that that we might we would
[54:06] desire to see in our life and it's the
[54:09] holy spirit that stirs these things up
[54:11] in our lives to begin to ask for God to
[54:16] fulfill his word in our life
[54:19] and it's something that we give
[54:22] ourselves to
[54:24] it's something to be diligent about so
[54:26] Jesus
[54:28] is praying here he is at this moment he
[54:31] is praying for the work of what God's
[54:36] desire has been from before the
[54:39] foundation of the world and that is that
[54:43] God might dwell fully in his children in
[54:47] that of redemption he had that in Adam
[54:49] and Eve he was dwelling in them they had
[54:52] his holy image in him is that right
[54:55] that's what they had but when they
[54:57] sinned they got away from the word that
[55:00] Holy image it left their life right but
[55:05] within that now what was in God the
[55:09] whole time to be a savior to be a
[55:11] redeemer to be and deliver all those
[55:13] attributes were within him all the time
[55:16] now the condition is what calls for
[55:20] those attributes to be made manifest and
[55:24] God would show it down through the
[55:26] scriptures in type he would all the way
[55:30] through I don't have time to deliberate
[55:31] on that but God desired first of all to
[55:35] express himself in other words they had
[55:39] down through the scriptures you could
[55:41] there hear us through Isaiah hear us
[55:43] through Jeremiah hear us through Abraham
[55:45] all of these that were down through the
[55:47] scriptures and it was just a portion of
[55:50] God revealing himself like a rainbow a
[55:53] rainbow is divided up into seven colors
[55:55] is that right and each one it's a
[55:57] portion that is made in there but where
[56:00] all of that those divided colors they
[56:03] come together other and it actually is a
[56:05] part and makes that of white light or
[56:07] white light broke apart is those seven
[56:10] colors is that right and that's how God
[56:13] even through the church ages they each
[56:16] had their dip of the Holy Spirit but at
[56:19] the end time it would not just be one
[56:22] color but it would be everything has
[56:26] been brought together to manifest the
[56:29] Living God and he would descend as he
[56:32] did in Revelations 10 with the Covenant
[56:35] rainbow around his head and he's a
[56:39] covenant-keeping god it would be the
[56:41] fullness of Jesus Christ once again on
[56:46] display through the ministry of Malachi
[56:48] 4 and now in a bright body
[56:52] it could never have moved to a bright
[56:54] body without being manifest through
[56:57] Malachi 4.
[56:59] that's God has a way because what it was
[57:02] what did he call us to it never called
[57:05] us to brother Branham it never called us
[57:07] uh to a church but what was it it was
[57:10] God stepping down and God issuing a
[57:14] bridegroom call to the Bride of a
[57:18] message that would have an effect upon
[57:20] Rebecca and would call her to the True
[57:23] Image and character that God ordained
[57:27] for her to be
[57:29] that's why Paul could say that there is
[57:32] a crown a new body a theophany laid up
[57:36] in glory for all of those who love his
[57:40] appearing not his coming his appearing
[57:42] but see is appearing in this hour it's
[57:45] not his Corporal coming it is the coming
[57:48] of the fullness of the Holy Spirit once
[57:52] again now in Bride form
[57:57] so first he is to express it's he wants
[58:01] to reveal himself
[58:04] and so now once he's revealed let me
[58:08] just uh as it comes to me to make this
[58:10] uh statement regarding that
[58:13] uh
[58:14] when you those brothers that were
[58:16] traveling to Sandusky yesterday
[58:19] um you saw the first sign if you were
[58:21] coming from here you saw the first sign
[58:23] that would have spoke of Sandusky and
[58:26] then the hearing it would have been
[58:27] right past Baumhart Road I know that
[58:29] because I used to travel that to work
[58:30] and you would know that now when you see
[58:32] Sandusky wrote on the sign you do not
[58:35] stop at the same
[58:37] right the sign tells you keep going
[58:41] the sign says you're headed the right
[58:43] way
[58:45] and here you fine going from 33 miles at
[58:47] that marker then you'll find yourself
[58:49] going further on down the line and here
[58:52] it comes it's no longer 33 miles it's
[58:54] closer why because of the direction that
[58:58] you're headed till eventually you make
[59:01] an exit into Sandusky and that's what
[59:04] the sign of Malachi 4 was it was a sign
[59:09] to let us know Jesus Christ is the same
[59:12] yesterday today and forever his Nature
[59:16] has never changed his power has never
[59:19] changed is that right because the same
[59:22] God that can stand right there and move
[59:24] down through a veil and say I see you
[59:27] over here this was what was wrong in
[59:29] your life but in the name of Jesus
[59:31] Christ you are healed and Cancers would
[59:33] drop diseases would drop you know what
[59:36] that was speaking of that there was an
[59:38] ever-present power to change the life of
[59:41] a believer that changes from Death unto
[59:44] life it shows us there's a present power
[59:46] that is here to change our bodies oh my
[59:50] it shows there's a present power that
[59:53] can deal with situations
[59:56] they're not alive
[59:59] I say glory be to God In the Heights
[1:00:04] what's your confidence brother Samuel my
[1:00:07] confidence is in the Lord
[1:00:08] [Applause]
[1:00:10] I tell you that no bones about it my
[1:00:13] confidence is in the Lord what are you
[1:00:15] going to do about this my confidence is
[1:00:17] in the Lord
[1:00:18] [Applause]
[1:00:20] right
[1:00:22] the second part is that he might have
[1:00:24] the preeminence now you Bible readers
[1:00:26] you know I'm going drawing even from
[1:00:28] Colossians 1.
[1:00:30] from where the Prophet had preached
[1:00:31] Christ the mystery and that preeminence
[1:00:35] is to where that he would Express
[1:00:37] himself
[1:00:39] through us
[1:00:41] and then that would lead to a restoring
[1:00:43] of the Kingdom to its rightly position
[1:00:45] let me just say this before I go any
[1:00:47] further the kingdom of God
[1:00:50] has come in to the Life by the baptism
[1:00:54] of the Holy Ghost
[1:00:56] then through that that moving into our
[1:00:59] life what does it do it directs us and
[1:01:02] moves us we are delegates of that
[1:01:05] Heavenly Jerusalem
[1:01:07] it is an announcement you realize in our
[1:01:11] life when the token life is on display
[1:01:13] it's an announcement to Satan one more
[1:01:17] time I'm going to remind you through
[1:01:19] another life you have been defeated
[1:01:23] the keys were stripped off of your side
[1:01:26] and then God lays claim on another and
[1:01:30] displays his grace through their life
[1:01:32] and what is it it's a testimony devil
[1:01:35] listen up you lost again
[1:01:38] oh he's on the losing side he's not on
[1:01:42] the win inside
[1:01:44] amen we're on the winning side and the
[1:01:47] wind inside is the Lord's Side
[1:01:49] [Music]
[1:01:54] Glory
[1:01:55] so secondly is to have the preeminence
[1:01:58] in his body of Believers that is his
[1:02:02] bride that he might live in people
[1:02:07] now you understand that here we are I
[1:02:11] want to read this to you out of the
[1:02:13] message things that are to be
[1:02:15] maybe to draw from here this morning
[1:02:19] speaking of this portion of scripture we
[1:02:22] read out of John 17.
[1:02:24] Jesus only asked for one thing
[1:02:27] in his prayer to the father
[1:02:29] you know what that was
[1:02:31] one thing after all of his sacrifice
[1:02:33] that he did here on Earth the life that
[1:02:36] he lived
[1:02:38] the path that he walked he asked for one
[1:02:41] thing
[1:02:43] that where I am
[1:02:45] they may be also
[1:02:49] but something he could have asked I know
[1:02:51] he could have asked for a lot of things
[1:02:52] I know he could have asked according to
[1:02:56] his physical needs
[1:02:57] [Applause]
[1:02:59] he could have asked according to his
[1:03:01] Spirit if we could say that were things
[1:03:03] where he was put he could have asked for
[1:03:05] that
[1:03:07] right
[1:03:09] but not this is what I'm saying when you
[1:03:12] consider how he was praying listen his
[1:03:15] reproach the mocking the spitting
[1:03:18] everything criticism that did not cease
[1:03:22] or lessen the closer he got to Calvary
[1:03:26] it intensified
[1:03:29] and that's why brother round could take
[1:03:31] us in the message identification and he
[1:03:33] says oh I see him going up to that and
[1:03:35] they said carrying the cross of the
[1:03:37] mountain I see one little blood spot now
[1:03:39] it's joining together with another one
[1:03:41] another one oh he finally his back is
[1:03:43] covered over with blood and he said oh
[1:03:45] how Satan no doubt looked at that and
[1:03:47] said there ain't no way that could be
[1:03:49] the Son of God because the Son of God
[1:03:51] wouldn't stand there and take that but
[1:03:53] brother Graham said oh yes a Son of God
[1:03:56] will when the Son of God knows he's
[1:03:58] doing the will of God he will stand
[1:04:01] there and he knows it's just the devil
[1:04:04] trying to get him out of line
[1:04:06] that's why when Peter rose up and Peter
[1:04:09] said they ain't gonna crucify you Jesus
[1:04:12] never said the Lord rebuked you Peter
[1:04:14] but he said Satan the Lord rebuked you
[1:04:17] because he knew it was Satan trying to
[1:04:20] hinder him from the plan and program of
[1:04:23] God
[1:04:24] tell you we ought to call the devil's
[1:04:27] name we ought to call here we ought to
[1:04:29] call him down
[1:04:32] I'm here for one purpose and that's to
[1:04:35] serve God
[1:04:37] and devil even get in my way I'm gonna
[1:04:39] put my feet on your neck I'm gonna take
[1:04:42] your head off
[1:04:45] well I'll do this and I'll do that but I
[1:04:47] ain't giving up
[1:04:50] let me tell you when the enemy has come
[1:04:53] around and whatever more I'll tell you
[1:04:55] what I've said in prayer I say it right
[1:04:57] out in prayer I'm going to turn up my
[1:04:59] praise you think I'm going to hold
[1:05:01] something back I'm going to turn it up
[1:05:03] I'm going to pray more I'm going to
[1:05:04] study more I'm going to be more diligent
[1:05:06] you're not shutting me down
[1:05:08] [Applause]
[1:05:10] how can you say that because there's
[1:05:12] something on the inside that's moving me
[1:05:16] he is the strength of my life
[1:05:19] [Applause]
[1:05:25] Jesus only asked for one thing in his
[1:05:27] prayer to the father
[1:05:28] you know what that was one thing after
[1:05:30] all the sacrifice that he did on Earth
[1:05:32] the life that he lived the path that he
[1:05:33] walked he asked for one thing and that's
[1:05:35] where I am they may be also he asked
[1:05:39] for our fellowship
[1:05:43] Lord have mercy he asked for our
[1:05:45] fellowship and we was guilty as a fox in
[1:05:48] a hen house
[1:05:49] but he wasn't he wasn't asking to join
[1:05:51] up with the fox he was asking to join up
[1:05:54] with his children
[1:05:57] he was asked for our fellowship and
[1:05:59] that's the only thing he asked the
[1:06:01] father in prayer was your companionship
[1:06:03] forever
[1:06:04] oh my I didn't notice brother Brown says
[1:06:06] then how much at the end of that
[1:06:08] paragraph then how much
[1:06:09] should we
[1:06:11] desire him
[1:06:13] he desired this this was a request
[1:06:17] now watch brother Brown says oh
[1:06:19] if you really are born of the spirit of
[1:06:22] God that means everything to you
[1:06:27] it ain't some Book of Rules you don't
[1:06:30] live any laws and so forth you live by
[1:06:33] the grace of God the spirit of God
[1:06:38] so it's God's desire
[1:06:41] that now comes down
[1:06:44] into the very heart of the believer
[1:06:48] Hallelujah
[1:06:50] what was once in his mind is now
[1:06:53] in the heart
[1:06:54] of his children
[1:06:58] what Grace
[1:07:00] who put that there not me
[1:07:02] not you
[1:07:04] he did that
[1:07:06] we're his workmanship
[1:07:12] Hallelujah
[1:07:15] Romans 2 11.
[1:07:18] for there is no respect the persons
[1:07:22] with God
[1:07:24] now I want you to watch how Paul goes
[1:07:26] into this in verse 12.
[1:07:27] regarding this no respecter of persons
[1:07:30] for as many as have sinned without law
[1:07:33] shall also perish without law
[1:07:36] and as many as have sinned in the law
[1:07:40] shall be judged by the law
[1:07:44] so the holy spirit is letting it be
[1:07:47] known it basically we could just put it
[1:07:50] right here there's no excuses
[1:07:53] that's just what it took away there's no
[1:07:56] excuse of God there's no respect to a
[1:07:58] person those that have perished without
[1:08:00] the law and then Paul's letting them
[1:08:02] know just because you've got the law if
[1:08:04] you're not walking in it you're also
[1:08:06] going to be judged
[1:08:09] is that right
[1:08:12] for not the hearers of the law are just
[1:08:16] before God
[1:08:17] but the doers of the law
[1:08:20] shall be justified
[1:08:22] for when the Gentiles I love this
[1:08:25] scripture which have not the law
[1:08:28] do by Nature the things contained in the
[1:08:33] law these having not the law are a law
[1:08:38] unto themselves
[1:08:41] now notice what he's saying the Gentiles
[1:08:44] which don't have the law but are doing
[1:08:46] by Nature
[1:08:49] that which is contained in the law
[1:08:54] so it's by Nature now as it goes on
[1:08:57] which show the work of the law written
[1:09:02] in their hearts their conscience also
[1:09:06] bearing witness and their thoughts the
[1:09:09] meanwhile accusing or else excusing one
[1:09:11] another in the day when God shall judge
[1:09:15] the secrets of men by Jesus Christ
[1:09:19] according to my gospel
[1:09:22] so to do by Nature now remember under
[1:09:25] the law
[1:09:26] man was judged righteous
[1:09:30] even based on of he did this and I did
[1:09:33] this and I did not do that
[1:09:35] but because remember Romans 8 the law
[1:09:39] was weak through the flesh
[1:09:43] but God was going to make a way that
[1:09:48] that law that word his nature would come
[1:09:52] into a people and it would not be uh
[1:09:57] just a keeping of laws but what it would
[1:09:59] be it would be the righteousness of God
[1:10:02] not because of what a man is doing but
[1:10:05] because of the nature that is within him
[1:10:09] you're with me we could spend we could
[1:10:11] go through the whole scriptures on that
[1:10:12] first John second John third John on and
[1:10:15] on but notice notice by Nature because
[1:10:18] now it is the righteousness of God
[1:10:21] within the heart of man acting himself
[1:10:23] in and through man and you know at one
[1:10:27] point our natural desire was to want to
[1:10:30] do the things of the world
[1:10:32] right that was natural that's why
[1:10:35] brother Brown tells us he said you take
[1:10:37] a young person he said unconverted he
[1:10:40] said that rock and roll he said we'll
[1:10:41] catch him sure is the world
[1:10:43] why because it's the nature that's there
[1:10:47] that's why I didn't come follow me when
[1:10:49] he's speaking to a small group of
[1:10:51] graduates and he says you know he said
[1:10:54] it wouldn't matter if you took this
[1:10:56] young person and put him in a remote
[1:10:58] Indian Camp whatever is on the inside is
[1:11:02] going to come out
[1:11:04] right that's why and that's why it's got
[1:11:07] to be a change on the inside
[1:11:10] are you hearing me now
[1:11:12] because it's not just being conformed to
[1:11:15] the message to all the you know we do
[1:11:18] this and we don't it's it's deeper than
[1:11:20] that it's gonna be a life on the inside
[1:11:24] is that right amen and that can only
[1:11:26] come by the new birth so your natural
[1:11:28] desire is to cut your hair your natural
[1:11:30] desire to wear shorts paint your face
[1:11:32] natural desires to be intellectual smart
[1:11:34] man know something better than the other
[1:11:36] so I mean my person may not have you
[1:11:39] know well this and that but but if it if
[1:11:41] this is still there a smart man you got
[1:11:43] to know something better than somebody
[1:11:44] else that's still part of the natural
[1:11:47] sinful desire
[1:11:49] are you hearing me now I'm quoting out
[1:11:51] of invisible Union
[1:11:52] because remember that's what it was that
[1:11:54] Drew the fall it's what Satan was
[1:11:57] wanting to present to Eve because you
[1:11:59] know it's there to love the world the
[1:12:01] things of it to desire it but something
[1:12:03] happened in our life what was it that
[1:12:05] changed us not our efforts or our works
[1:12:08] we do have to yield ourselves to God
[1:12:10] God's not going to pull us and and we
[1:12:12] you know are sitting around like dead
[1:12:13] weight that ain't yielding but when we
[1:12:16] yield we're you were moved by the love
[1:12:18] of God and God is drawing us and and
[1:12:20] bringing us to himself there's a
[1:12:22] yielding to the work of Calvary that the
[1:12:25] spirit of God might come forth in our
[1:12:27] life in Romans 8 10 notice this if
[1:12:30] Christ be in you
[1:12:32] the body is dead because of sin but the
[1:12:36] spirit is life because of righteousness
[1:12:41] so the only way Christ can be in US is
[1:12:44] the body is dead
[1:12:46] my now we've worked with this a little
[1:12:48] bit last week the body is dead what is
[1:12:51] Paul dealing with he's talking about
[1:12:53] that first nature
[1:12:56] right because there's people that could
[1:12:58] remember me from high school or before a
[1:13:01] lot of times you got to show them
[1:13:02] pictures because I had hair back then
[1:13:04] right
[1:13:06] but you know the thing of it is is that
[1:13:08] the same body
[1:13:10] but what's different is what's on the
[1:13:12] inside
[1:13:14] that's real Christianity
[1:13:18] are you hearing me now what's on the
[1:13:20] outside what's on the inside so if
[1:13:22] Christ be in you the body is dead
[1:13:25] because of sin but the spirit is life
[1:13:28] because of righteousness
[1:13:31] is that right
[1:13:33] so the nature because remember the
[1:13:36] nature of the spirit is the soul
[1:13:38] remember it wasn't our body that died it
[1:13:42] was in our spirit that died but it was
[1:13:44] that soul that died
[1:13:48] that nature but you say well why did
[1:13:50] that have to die because remember God
[1:13:52] won't marry us when we've got a living
[1:13:55] husband
[1:13:56] come on now Romans 7. he's got to follow
[1:13:59] his word there's got to be a death not
[1:14:02] just a divorce because a divorce that
[1:14:05] God can come back again
[1:14:07] whether he's 15 years in the message 20
[1:14:09] years in the message 30 years in the
[1:14:11] message if he's never dead and just
[1:14:14] divorce he'll come back
[1:14:16] hello now you know I'm preaching to you
[1:14:19] now it might get hard but let's get
[1:14:21] through it now
[1:14:22] but you see not notice this but if the
[1:14:25] spirit of him that raised up Jesus from
[1:14:29] the dead dwell in you I love that he
[1:14:32] that raised up Christ from the dead
[1:14:34] shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by
[1:14:37] his spirit that dwelleth in you did you
[1:14:39] catch that raise you up raise you up
[1:14:41] when the Holy Spirit is come and he's
[1:14:44] dealing with your life the holy spirit
[1:14:46] is not putting you down he's trying to
[1:14:49] lift you up
[1:14:51] it's sin and traps of the enemy that's
[1:14:54] got you where you're at but the
[1:14:56] quickening power of God comes by to do
[1:14:59] what encourage you to try to lift you up
[1:15:01] there is no other spirit that can lift
[1:15:05] you up in the right way to the right
[1:15:07] position outside of the quickening power
[1:15:10] of almighty God I'm not talking about
[1:15:13] lifting you into a church I'm talking
[1:15:15] about lifting you into position in
[1:15:18] Heavenly places
[1:15:20] and the same way it raised him up on
[1:15:23] that Easter morning is the same way
[1:15:25] it'll raise in an Easter in our lives
[1:15:29] therefore Brethren now because of this
[1:15:33] we are
[1:15:34] debtors but not to the flesh
[1:15:37] to live after the flesh
[1:15:40] so the flesh is going to try to exact
[1:15:42] some things
[1:15:44] but you're not in debt to it
[1:15:46] you've got to remember there's there
[1:15:48] there has to be a Liberty on the inside
[1:15:51] are you hearing me now and if you live
[1:15:54] after the flesh
[1:15:55] you shall die
[1:15:57] but if you through the spirit
[1:16:01] do mortify the Deeds of the body you
[1:16:04] shall live
[1:16:06] everybody with me
[1:16:08] not through our efforts but through the
[1:16:10] spirit
[1:16:12] what are you talking about I'm talking
[1:16:14] about a son and daughter of God that he
[1:16:16] is ruling and reigning oh brother Samuel
[1:16:18] we're going to do that in the Millennium
[1:16:19] I'm telling you right now there won't be
[1:16:21] no Millennium for you if you don't have
[1:16:23] it here and ruling over it right now
[1:16:27] because it's got to take a quickening
[1:16:29] power that brings this guy in subjection
[1:16:32] to the word
[1:16:33] man come on now
[1:16:35] because you let somebody cross you the
[1:16:37] debt of the flesh will raise right up
[1:16:39] get even with them is that right but
[1:16:42] there's got to be a greater power on the
[1:16:45] inside that says shut up get back here
[1:16:48] that is not Who We Are
[1:16:49] [Applause]
[1:16:51] come on Friends
[1:16:52] [Applause]
[1:16:54] my Lord have mercy
[1:16:56] we did not when we got the Holy Ghost
[1:16:58] this did not become a glorified body
[1:17:03] you have got to bring it in subjection
[1:17:06] please tell me what do you say I'm
[1:17:08] saying that every thought is to be
[1:17:11] judged by the word of God
[1:17:15] bring it subject to the Judgment seat of
[1:17:18] Christ and if you've got the Holy Ghost
[1:17:20] he's in you
[1:17:21] [Music]
[1:17:23] whom I mortifying the Deeds of the body
[1:17:26] ye shall live
[1:17:28] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[1:17:31] God they're the sons of God now watch
[1:17:34] your brother around brings us he said
[1:17:35] this outside is sin
[1:17:37] now let me just sometimes I don't feel
[1:17:40] like I have to quantify it to I
[1:17:42] shouldn't have to to a group of
[1:17:43] Believers but I do not believe stuff is
[1:17:45] saying well you know I I'm born again on
[1:17:48] the inside but this outside you know he
[1:17:50] just that's that's not true
[1:17:53] because what you're saying is there's a
[1:17:55] power on the outside that's greater than
[1:17:57] what I got
[1:17:59] I just read a scripture if the spirit
[1:18:01] that raised up Christ from the dead
[1:18:04] dwell in you
[1:18:06] not on you not around you not a feeling
[1:18:09] it's got to be in You by an inborn
[1:18:12] nature
[1:18:16] [Music]
[1:18:17] this outside is sin see it's to
[1:18:20] recognize what it is
[1:18:22] that right when we can really recognize
[1:18:24] what that is over the same I thought
[1:18:26] we're preaching on Oneness with God
[1:18:27] working in us that's right have to do
[1:18:29] that before I can never get to the body
[1:18:31] because you know why we need to
[1:18:32] understand ourselves
[1:18:35] so we can be able to help and to
[1:18:37] understand one another because we sure
[1:18:39] need the grace of God for ourselves and
[1:18:41] we need the grace of God for one another
[1:18:43] is that right I think of how the prophet
[1:18:46] said in the message of Grace he said oh
[1:18:47] it taken Grace to hold Jehovah's family
[1:18:50] together
[1:18:52] the grace of God and we sure need God's
[1:18:55] grace don't we this outside is sin that
[1:18:57] what that means is is that I do not
[1:18:59] trust this guy
[1:19:01] right I don't trust him
[1:19:05] I'm not afraid of him but neither do I
[1:19:07] trust him
[1:19:08] is that right
[1:19:10] do you know that you know your body is
[1:19:13] sin that's the reason don't try to
[1:19:16] perfect that body it's sin
[1:19:20] do you know that it was born in sin
[1:19:22] shaped in iniquity come to the world
[1:19:24] speaking lies and that soul is the same
[1:19:27] way until the soul died and then was
[1:19:31] born again of God then that Soul can't
[1:19:34] die the soul that Sinners shall die but
[1:19:36] he that believeth on me has everlasting
[1:19:37] life then there is an immortal life
[1:19:40] watch out brother and places this then
[1:19:42] there is an immortal life living in that
[1:19:46] body
[1:19:47] so the body is not the immortal life but
[1:19:51] Immortal Life Has Come and is projecting
[1:19:54] itself through this body and this body
[1:19:58] is sin wow
[1:20:00] but Samuel what a contrast I agree what
[1:20:03] a contrast
[1:20:05] right what a contrast to think the glory
[1:20:09] of God the glory that would be unfolded
[1:20:11] to you and I that would uncover and
[1:20:14] reveal who you and I are that portion of
[1:20:16] God coming to you and I have the Holy
[1:20:18] Spirit to bring about the new birth on
[1:20:20] the inside what does it bring forth a
[1:20:23] son and daughter of God and here is a
[1:20:26] son and daughter of God which is who you
[1:20:28] really are you're not really the person
[1:20:30] that you brush his teeth comb his hair
[1:20:31] if you've got it that is not the real
[1:20:33] you when you have been born of the
[1:20:35] spirit of God the real you this is only
[1:20:37] the veil that is used to display the
[1:20:41] invisible son or daughter of God an
[1:20:44] attribute that came from his thinking
[1:20:45] and has been projected into a body of
[1:20:48] time
[1:20:49] is that right
[1:20:51] so here it's Immortal Life living in a
[1:20:54] body what a contrast
[1:20:55] and it's a continual contrast is that
[1:20:58] right
[1:20:59] it's a continual contrast in our life
[1:21:01] when the spirit of God has moved into
[1:21:03] our life now notice that's like a stream
[1:21:05] coming from heaven and that's where it
[1:21:08] had to come from like a core on the
[1:21:12] inside of a man
[1:21:13] now what's at the core that's the seed
[1:21:16] right and you get the seed the seed is
[1:21:19] what will produce more of the same kind
[1:21:22] right so that life coming down into the
[1:21:25] core which is where the seed which is
[1:21:27] where the heart of it is at now notice
[1:21:29] that stream coming from heaven like a
[1:21:31] core on the inside of a man that's the
[1:21:33] part that's Godly that operates this
[1:21:36] body
[1:21:38] we could just stop right here and have a
[1:21:39] prayer meeting
[1:21:40] and say Lord
[1:21:42] if it's not there in me yet
[1:21:44] Let It Be
[1:21:46] and Lord where it is in my life let me
[1:21:49] yield to The Godly part
[1:21:51] because The Godly part has never led me
[1:21:54] wrong once I've been born of the spirit
[1:21:56] of God that Godly part has never made me
[1:21:58] never let me wrong you know what I've
[1:22:00] never had to ask somebody to forgive me
[1:22:02] for something The Godly part did because
[1:22:05] The Godly part didn't do it
[1:22:07] wow am I preaching to Angels this
[1:22:09] morning are you all just shell-shocked
[1:22:17] listens to sin but you see what it is
[1:22:19] neither is it remember as he said don't
[1:22:22] try to perfect this body
[1:22:24] because you can try to perfect this body
[1:22:26] you've got this down this down this down
[1:22:28] and yet you're missing what's the most
[1:22:30] important thing is on the inside
[1:22:33] you can have all the other right and if
[1:22:35] you don't have the life on the inside
[1:22:36] you'll never come up
[1:22:39] is that right now watch before this body
[1:22:42] can ever be perfected in other words
[1:22:44] changed the spirit will bring it in
[1:22:48] submission to God so you realize what
[1:22:50] the Rapture is it's a final subduing of
[1:22:54] our body to the promise and glory of God
[1:22:57] that is already dwelling in our lives
[1:23:00] because the Rapture is not going to be
[1:23:02] like wow this is an amazing day
[1:23:03] everything's just right the toast came
[1:23:05] out right Pop-Tarts are just right this
[1:23:07] morning mine's got frosting all over him
[1:23:09] man I mean she fixed the eggs perfect
[1:23:11] this morning my goodness that you know
[1:23:12] the workers got donuts and I got the
[1:23:14] freshest one let me tell you something
[1:23:15] there can be perhaps on the Rapture
[1:23:17] morning it might be one of the worst
[1:23:19] mornings that you have been faced with
[1:23:21] trials that have been all around you but
[1:23:24] what will it be it will be another day
[1:23:26] in the life of a Believer where you have
[1:23:29] looked around at trials where you have
[1:23:31] looked around at things around you and
[1:23:33] said ain't gonna hold me back ain't
[1:23:35] gonna stop me I'm gonna go on whether I
[1:23:38] feel like praising him or not I'm gonna
[1:23:40] praise him I'm going to declare he is
[1:23:42] worthy what are you doing I'll tell you
[1:23:44] what you're doing Enoch you're taking
[1:23:46] another step you're going beyond your
[1:23:49] feelings you're going beyond your
[1:23:51] thoughts how am I doing that because the
[1:23:54] quickening power within you keeps
[1:23:57] quickening Quicken and Quicken and
[1:23:58] quicker
[1:24:02] wow
[1:24:04] takes you right away don't it because
[1:24:06] sometimes we come into a service let's
[1:24:08] just bring it down here sometimes we
[1:24:09] come into a service and my if it seems
[1:24:11] like the song leaders had the struggle
[1:24:13] if it seems like the keys aren't hitting
[1:24:15] right if it just seems like well this is
[1:24:18] too loud and that's too hard and that's
[1:24:20] too cold and what you come to church for
[1:24:22] anyhow
[1:24:24] huh what do we come for anyhow
[1:24:28] but listen
[1:24:29] this goes to show you and I what if and
[1:24:32] we are battled within a service
[1:24:36] come on even when you go out into other
[1:24:37] meetings or whatever more
[1:24:40] right see somebody or whatever more and
[1:24:42] God dealing with hearts and so forth but
[1:24:44] notice what is it you don't allow that
[1:24:46] to hold you back
[1:24:49] are you hearing me Church
[1:24:51] what is it it's an overcoming power that
[1:24:55] is moving within you to overcome your
[1:24:58] feelings your flesh your thoughts
[1:25:01] there's got to be a greater is he that
[1:25:04] is in me
[1:25:07] my
[1:25:08] bringing me in submission to the word of
[1:25:11] God so you know what that causes me to
[1:25:12] do that if tomorrow morning I wake up
[1:25:14] and guess what
[1:25:16] my coffee just doesn't taste just right
[1:25:18] I'm not going to say
[1:25:23] steamed milk was on top instead of the
[1:25:25] bottom and building it up
[1:25:27] can't be a Rapture Day oh no on the
[1:25:29] contrary because remember when God
[1:25:31] visited Abraham's tent the prophet said
[1:25:33] in the tent that morning Abraham and
[1:25:36] Sarah had just had a little fuss
[1:25:41] but I can't keep he can't keep God away
[1:25:44] from fulfilling his word
[1:25:46] listen what are you saying I'm telling
[1:25:48] you that you shouldn't let buses keep
[1:25:50] you from church you shouldn't let well
[1:25:52] things didn't go right at home don't let
[1:25:54] anything Satan will do anything to keep
[1:25:58] you away from the promise of God but the
[1:26:01] promise of God Is So Much Greater why
[1:26:03] because he who made the promise is
[1:26:08] faithful
[1:26:11] and he abides faithful
[1:26:15] even when we don't
[1:26:20] but before this body can ever be
[1:26:23] perfected the spirit will bring an in
[1:26:25] submission to God
[1:26:28] now you think you have to do that
[1:26:29] preachers have to do that as well too
[1:26:33] it doesn't get any easier
[1:26:35] everything has to go all of us we all
[1:26:37] have our sacrifice to make how many
[1:26:39] knows it's true sometimes it's easier in
[1:26:41] the house of God sometimes it's easier
[1:26:44] to press through sometimes you have the
[1:26:45] song Services where it's almost like
[1:26:47] somebody just went to act like they were
[1:26:49] going to touch the piano and man it's
[1:26:50] just like
[1:26:51] and it isn't the piano it's the spirit
[1:26:53] of God but what created that oh my
[1:26:55] neighbor no not your neighbor oh brother
[1:26:57] no I'm not brother so and so you had a
[1:26:59] spirit of expectation
[1:27:02] and whatever you come expecting that's
[1:27:04] what you're going to get
[1:27:10] but the spirit will bring us in
[1:27:12] submission to God watch this it'll
[1:27:15] let me make sure I get my glasses on
[1:27:16] make sure I gotta read this right
[1:27:19] it'll War
[1:27:21] all the time
[1:27:23] a constant
[1:27:26] Oh My Flesh just loves to pray
[1:27:28] I hate to call you a liar but I'm going
[1:27:30] to call you a liar
[1:27:32] on my flesh just love me no it is in my
[1:27:35] flesh My Flesh at times don't want to
[1:27:37] study My Flesh at times don't want to
[1:27:39] Pray My Flesh at times don't want to get
[1:27:41] in to the message my flesh sometimes
[1:27:43] maybe don't want to shake this hand or
[1:27:45] shake that hand or do this come on now
[1:27:47] I'm preaching to you but what is it
[1:27:49] there's something there on the inside
[1:27:51] that moves us forward
[1:27:55] all right
[1:27:58] oh brother Samuel you're just too plain
[1:28:00] well we need plainness in this hour
[1:28:02] because the devil is not laying
[1:28:04] underneath the cloak the devil is very
[1:28:06] intentional in shoving his agenda down
[1:28:08] people's lives
[1:28:10] and I believe we're living in the hour
[1:28:12] of the revealing of the son of man each
[1:28:13] time to be intentional it's time to
[1:28:16] speak it plain
[1:28:17] is that right there ain't no holier than
[1:28:19] thou there ain't no person up here here
[1:28:21] that's better remember it is all in need
[1:28:24] of The Sovereign Grace of God to Reign
[1:28:26] Over in our life you say what do you
[1:28:28] mean by that when you can really see
[1:28:30] that in your own life then you can have
[1:28:32] Grace for somebody else in their life
[1:28:36] preach brother Samuel think a will
[1:28:41] Paul said we'll never get more than him
[1:28:44] he said when I would do good
[1:28:47] what did he say
[1:28:49] evil is near me
[1:28:52] and that's a part-time
[1:28:55] sometimes
[1:28:57] what's it say
[1:28:58] constant War
[1:29:00] so if the devil ain't taking off no days
[1:29:03] what does that say
[1:29:06] hey the devil's faithful man
[1:29:09] come on now the devil listen the devil's
[1:29:11] faithful he comes right around he's
[1:29:13] faithful to come faithful you know what
[1:29:15] listen he does the same thing he's
[1:29:17] always done
[1:29:18] he tries to do the same things only he's
[1:29:20] Faithful is that right
[1:29:22] if the devil can be that faithful and
[1:29:24] you and I have a greater spirit inside
[1:29:26] of us the spirit of God because it
[1:29:28] wasn't the devil that made God it was
[1:29:29] God that created the devil
[1:29:31] is that right and you've got the deity
[1:29:33] of Jesus Christ in you
[1:29:35] hello
[1:29:36] your brother Samuel what's the problem
[1:29:39] right here right here we baby this guy
[1:29:43] too much
[1:29:44] we say he's our worst enemy oh boy
[1:29:48] but don't touch him
[1:29:52] see sometimes we really don't believe
[1:29:53] what we're saying we say God help me
[1:29:55] Lord
[1:29:57] because he is he's our worst enemy
[1:30:00] now if you're already there you pray for
[1:30:01] us sorry folk that we'll get to where
[1:30:03] you're at okay
[1:30:05] because I'm so glad that when God gave
[1:30:07] you the Holy Ghost he gave you a
[1:30:08] glorified body but that ain't the truth
[1:30:11] First Corinthians 4 20. remember not a
[1:30:13] license to sin it's got to be the spirit
[1:30:15] of God on the inside notice First
[1:30:17] Corinthians 4 20 for the kingdom of God
[1:30:21] is not in Word
[1:30:23] but in power
[1:30:26] it's not the message Oneness what's what
[1:30:28] he says here the kingdom of God is God's
[1:30:30] word me power what is the kingdom of God
[1:30:32] it's within you the Kingdom's in you
[1:30:36] now watch the statement and when the
[1:30:38] word comes in there
[1:30:43] notice where when it comes in there what
[1:30:45] was the there
[1:30:47] not just here
[1:30:49] but it will start there in the mind is
[1:30:51] that right
[1:30:52] amen that's how the new birth comes it
[1:30:53] starts in the mind first agreeing with
[1:30:55] the word accepting opening the mind
[1:30:58] which is the womb opening up and
[1:31:00] allowing the word to come in beginning
[1:31:02] to accept the word of God agreeing with
[1:31:04] the word of God what God has said and
[1:31:06] then allowing the spirit of God to come
[1:31:09] behind and bring the word down to its
[1:31:12] rightful resting place
[1:31:14] now I want you to keep this in mind as
[1:31:16] we'll talk about these things for a few
[1:31:17] minutes when we're talking about the
[1:31:19] word I am talking about this but we're
[1:31:21] not all together just talking about this
[1:31:24] we're talking about the person of the
[1:31:26] word himself
[1:31:29] is that right when the Lord Jesus came
[1:31:31] if there would have been one prophecy
[1:31:33] unfulfilled or was something in his life
[1:31:36] that was not hitting up with the
[1:31:38] Fulfillment of the word he would not
[1:31:40] have been the Messiah
[1:31:43] are you hearing me now he could have it
[1:31:45] could have been 99 and nine tenths it
[1:31:47] would not have been the Fulfillment of
[1:31:49] the word
[1:31:50] but it had to hit on perfectly
[1:31:54] is that right because it is the word
[1:31:56] himself
[1:31:58] and when the word comes in there what
[1:32:00] does that word what does this word begin
[1:32:02] oh I love this it turns itself into
[1:32:06] Power making it say just exactly what it
[1:32:11] said you say you can't say it says this
[1:32:15] and it says that and make it work
[1:32:19] so
[1:32:20] splashing quotes
[1:32:23] splashing scripture to make it fit your
[1:32:25] life it won't work
[1:32:28] I'll be on the days of splicing tape but
[1:32:30] you can't Splash quotes either picking
[1:32:32] out our favorite quotes and favorite
[1:32:33] things it's got to be a life that lines
[1:32:35] up with the word
[1:32:37] is that right because that's what it's
[1:32:38] about it's about a Word in Life notice
[1:32:40] you can't say it says this and it says
[1:32:42] that and make it work you've got to say
[1:32:46] the same thing it says that makes a
[1:32:49] confession not saying well it's polished
[1:32:51] up here a little and I'll have more
[1:32:53] wisdom and I'll be in better
[1:32:54] understanding over there no what it has
[1:32:56] to be is the Amen on the inside
[1:32:59] expressing the word of God
[1:33:02] is that right
[1:33:03] oh bless Samuel that's awful time you
[1:33:05] remember how brother Ben tells a story
[1:33:06] about them recruits when they come into
[1:33:08] basic training and he talks about how
[1:33:10] them sergeants will just rake them good
[1:33:13] man getting them out of the bed kicking
[1:33:15] the can down and everything getting
[1:33:16] right in their face and oh I know now
[1:33:17] that everything's become a bunch of
[1:33:18] sissies you can't get in their face and
[1:33:20] you can't correct people and you can't
[1:33:21] do this and you can't do that I know
[1:33:23] that stuff started way back there but
[1:33:25] you understand you got all these things
[1:33:27] that's come all the way down and brother
[1:33:28] Brown lays it down in this way he said
[1:33:30] you take that recruit oh my he'll say
[1:33:32] that's Sergeant oh here he comes again
[1:33:34] this Sergeant's so nitpicky he wants her
[1:33:36] boots looking like this and he wants to
[1:33:38] see his reflection he wants my rifle
[1:33:40] like this he wants you why do you think
[1:33:42] that he's doing that do you think that
[1:33:44] Sergeant is doing that because he just
[1:33:47] wants to do that because he's picking on
[1:33:49] you now maybe you will think that if
[1:33:51] you've had somebody pick on you
[1:33:54] but that's where you're going to need
[1:33:55] the grace of God to say help me get over
[1:33:57] this thought
[1:33:58] because if not you'll put everybody else
[1:34:01] back in the box of anybody who's got any
[1:34:03] little bit of 40 over you you'll put
[1:34:05] them right back there but there is a
[1:34:06] true Authority
[1:34:08] is that right but when it comes down to
[1:34:10] the battlefield and they're crawling
[1:34:12] underneath them bullets and then bullets
[1:34:14] are shooting over and they're running
[1:34:15] let me tell you something brother
[1:34:16] Brandon said it very clear and I know
[1:34:18] there's been those who stood in the
[1:34:19] battlefield sitting right here this
[1:34:20] morning you know what they are not
[1:34:22] complaining about that Sergeant then you
[1:34:24] know why because they have been prepared
[1:34:26] for the battle and let me tell you
[1:34:28] something the preaching of the Gospel of
[1:34:31] Jesus Christ what is it doing it is
[1:34:33] preparing you for a battle we must be
[1:34:36] able to stand in the end time having
[1:34:39] done all to stand stand therefore handle
[1:34:43] your lines gird about with truth yeah
[1:34:46] Hallelujah it don't take patch on the
[1:34:49] back and well you're a good guy you're a
[1:34:51] good messy believer you can know it
[1:34:53] takes it down let the word bring
[1:34:55] discernment in our life
[1:34:57] if we need to be born again let's line
[1:35:00] up with a word if there's something in
[1:35:02] our life that's not right let's line up
[1:35:05] with the word let's bring in its
[1:35:07] subjection to the word of God
[1:35:10] why because whatever is said here must
[1:35:12] be said from here
[1:35:14] that's a True Confession
[1:35:18] Hallelujah going down to paragraph 89s
[1:35:20] Mr Brianna what is it
[1:35:23] he said you've got to get with the word
[1:35:25] and get yourself
[1:35:27] killed out
[1:35:29] wow get with the word
[1:35:32] and get myself killed out
[1:35:35] when's the last time you ever wanted to
[1:35:38] get with somebody who was going to kill
[1:35:39] you
[1:35:42] come on I'm not mentioning words we're
[1:35:44] not mixed when's the last time you would
[1:35:46] go but you see what it is
[1:35:48] he doesn't approach you that way
[1:35:51] it's the love of God drawing you to what
[1:35:54] Calvary
[1:35:56] well brother Samuel he went to Calvary
[1:35:57] for me he did because without him going
[1:36:00] to his Calvary we could never go to our
[1:36:03] Calvary
[1:36:04] because Jesus wrote about our cross a
[1:36:07] whole lot more
[1:36:08] than he ever did about his own
[1:36:10] take up your cross and follow me right
[1:36:13] Paul writes of it over and over through
[1:36:15] the scriptures Galatians Romans on and
[1:36:17] on why because it is a crucifying of
[1:36:21] self
[1:36:22] you've got to get with the word and get
[1:36:24] yourself killed out
[1:36:25] and I'm persuaded
[1:36:27] that many of us friends have received
[1:36:29] the Holy Ghost
[1:36:31] but we just receive enough holy ghost in
[1:36:35] US
[1:36:36] to make us to a place
[1:36:38] where we don't want to lie
[1:36:40] we don't want to steal
[1:36:42] we don't want to do anything
[1:36:45] brother brown one's saying we just don't
[1:36:46] want to do anything he just says we
[1:36:48] don't want to do anything I mean he
[1:36:49] means I want to do nothing wrong
[1:36:51] but God wants to fill every fiber of his
[1:36:54] church
[1:36:57] can we say Amen
[1:37:00] not just enough not just I got enough I
[1:37:03] got enough I got enough I got enough I
[1:37:05] had enough
[1:37:06] well I don't wanna I don't you know I
[1:37:08] quit smoking but be careful that quit
[1:37:10] wasn't you quitting
[1:37:11] because if it's you quit and that's a
[1:37:13] new spirit
[1:37:15] is that right but see just to receive
[1:37:17] just enough I don't I don't want to
[1:37:19] receive just enough
[1:37:21] I know what he did in my life it's not
[1:37:23] just enough it's something about it when
[1:37:24] God begins to touch and draw upon your
[1:37:27] heart what is it it's the love of God
[1:37:28] this is not listen a church this is not
[1:37:31] a church demand it is Christ himself
[1:37:33] where he said if I be lifted up I will
[1:37:37] draw all men
[1:37:40] unto me
[1:37:42] it's him that's drawing us on it's him
[1:37:45] that's encouraging you and I it's God
[1:37:47] that gives you and I the grace for
[1:37:50] ourselves
[1:37:51] to get killed out
[1:37:54] let me just try to finish this quote
[1:37:55] here
[1:37:57] but God wants to fill every fiber of his
[1:38:00] church
[1:38:01] he wants to feel your thinking
[1:38:03] he wants to fill your mind
[1:38:06] he wants to fill every bit of you and
[1:38:10] just make you completely totally dead to
[1:38:15] yourself
[1:38:16] or to your thinking
[1:38:21] I don't know about you but I could say
[1:38:23] Lord
[1:38:24] I need another refilling
[1:38:28] it's one feeling when you have been
[1:38:30] filled with the spirit of God that
[1:38:32] listen when the spirit of God when
[1:38:34] there's been an initial feeling a real
[1:38:36] birth on the inside listen the things of
[1:38:38] the world is gone and it puts your
[1:38:40] desire completely toward Calvary but
[1:38:42] what does it do there's a longing for
[1:38:44] more of God
[1:38:47] it's like when they talk about
[1:38:48] individuals and they have to be so
[1:38:50] careful at the hospitals I think about
[1:38:52] you know I've never never had it but I
[1:38:54] think about the times that probably
[1:38:55] you've heard brother Jewell talk about
[1:38:57] this and brother Jewel Forney when right
[1:38:59] before God had got a hold of his life
[1:39:00] and you know the ways and things like
[1:39:02] Eddie was running and Manny had shot
[1:39:03] himself right through the leg and so
[1:39:05] forth and here he was in the hospital
[1:39:07] and he said I'll tell you he said they
[1:39:09] started letting that morphine drip down
[1:39:11] because he was in such excruciating pain
[1:39:13] and he said you know what he said I find
[1:39:16] myself he said very quickly I became
[1:39:18] addicted to that morphine in there I
[1:39:21] began to ask them nurses I need some
[1:39:23] more I need some more you know how now
[1:39:25] they'll give you those little pumps
[1:39:27] and they give you like a joystick you
[1:39:29] can you can rapid fire it but it's only
[1:39:31] going to release so much at a time
[1:39:35] I pray God
[1:39:36] he's put it in our hands
[1:39:39] he's put in her hands the Holy Ghost is
[1:39:41] just not limited
[1:39:42] it's not limited of what it can do and
[1:39:45] what he desires to do in your life but
[1:39:47] he wants to fill every fiber
[1:39:49] he wants to fill every fiber I'll tell
[1:39:51] you what I do I just I keep on I keep on
[1:39:53] pressing I keep on moving forward and
[1:39:55] say Lord every fiber of my life if I'm
[1:39:58] not there yet that's what I'd be asking
[1:40:00] God not just casually but to see the
[1:40:03] hour demands it
[1:40:05] the time we're living in requires it
[1:40:08] this is token time
[1:40:11] it's not enough for a church we all can
[1:40:14] see that it's not enough to be around
[1:40:16] something it's not enough to know it we
[1:40:18] have got to have the word on the inside
[1:40:21] of us it's got to be a personal
[1:40:24] experience between us and God where we
[1:40:27] are no longer the same people
[1:40:30] is that right notice this totally dead
[1:40:33] to yourself or to your thinking just so
[1:40:37] surrendered in God
[1:40:39] till his words
[1:40:41] just living
[1:40:43] right through you
[1:40:44] and you don't know nothing else but
[1:40:46] God's word
[1:40:48] just stay right with his word
[1:40:50] it is life
[1:40:52] the kingdom of God
[1:40:54] this is what Jesus prayed for
[1:40:57] he prayed that this Oneness would be in
[1:40:59] our life where
[1:41:00] that he
[1:41:02] would dwell
[1:41:05] in every individual child of God
[1:41:10] he this is the very desire of God
[1:41:15] what was Jesus it was the heart of God
[1:41:19] on display
[1:41:21] and the display was for Oneness
[1:41:25] a Oneness
[1:41:26] how are they going to be one
[1:41:28] the glory you have given me
[1:41:31] I have given them
[1:41:34] that same Glory that has brought forth
[1:41:36] the manifestation of the word in my life
[1:41:38] revealed as the Son of God that same
[1:41:43] life that same Glory
[1:41:45] I have given to them the Holy Spirit had
[1:41:48] not even been poured out yet but their
[1:41:50] eyes were being opened did they
[1:41:52] understand they didn't even understand
[1:41:53] the events that was taking place right
[1:41:56] then
[1:41:57] but remember God's word would be
[1:41:59] fulfilled God would gather his children
[1:42:01] up that was confused at what had
[1:42:03] happened I don't understand why did this
[1:42:05] happen we thought he was the one that
[1:42:07] should have redeemed Israel what's going
[1:42:09] on here I don't know what's taking place
[1:42:11] but what did he do as a faithful
[1:42:13] Shepherd fulfilling his word he went and
[1:42:16] he gathered his sheep
[1:42:18] and directing them to the promise
[1:42:21] of Pentecost
[1:42:23] when that life
[1:42:25] would be poured out
[1:42:28] that's what he directed him to that now
[1:42:30] that God himself this desire that God
[1:42:33] would now come back in to dwell inside
[1:42:36] his people
[1:42:38] think about it
[1:42:41] filling every fiber of their being
[1:42:45] because the holy spirit will come and he
[1:42:47] he'll deal with our life he brings about
[1:42:48] repentance what's he doing he's moving
[1:42:51] into where it's touching our heart it's
[1:42:53] causing us to do what instead of walking
[1:42:55] this way repentance comes and there's a
[1:42:59] real turn that's what repentance is
[1:43:00] you're no longer going that way
[1:43:03] right what do I do let him feel some
[1:43:07] more fibers
[1:43:09] well what's filling more fibers where he
[1:43:11] he cleanses the desires
[1:43:14] he puts he changes your thinking
[1:43:17] about things of the world
[1:43:20] he changes your thinking
[1:43:22] about that of sin and unbelief I don't
[1:43:24] want to do that I I don't want to do
[1:43:26] this I don't want what is that he's
[1:43:28] feeling more fibrous
[1:43:32] are you hearing me now
[1:43:34] new heart new spirit
[1:43:37] but he said
[1:43:39] I will put my spirit in
[1:43:42] well brother Samuel why did he give me a
[1:43:43] new spirit because you couldn't even get
[1:43:45] along with yourself
[1:43:48] you know I'm quoting that across many
[1:43:49] quotes right now we couldn't even get
[1:43:51] along with ourselves much less God
[1:43:54] he had to give us a new spirit and then
[1:43:56] he comes by his spirit
[1:43:59] and sits down in the middle
[1:44:02] and he begins to control
[1:44:05] and feed from that innermost part God
[1:44:07] wants to fill
[1:44:09] every fiber
[1:44:11] until it's him being reflected in US
[1:44:17] I said granted Lord Jesus
[1:44:20] granted Lord God fill every fiber of me
[1:44:23] feel every fiber Lord I need more of you
[1:44:27] I need more of you
[1:44:28] I I want more of the Holy Ghost
[1:44:31] I want more I want a refilling
[1:44:33] I don't want just enough I need it
[1:44:36] say brother Samuel why do you need it
[1:44:37] because I still pack this sticky guy
[1:44:39] around I need more of Jesus
[1:44:42] I need more of him
[1:44:45] but the Samuel what does that do for you
[1:44:47] I'll tell you what it does for me
[1:44:48] instead of allowing stuff to get stuck
[1:44:50] on me so easily having a refilling of
[1:44:53] the Holy Spirit allows things that want
[1:44:55] to get stuck on me and allows it to keep
[1:44:58] moving on why because that's the power
[1:45:01] of the revealing of the Holy Ghost
[1:45:03] but Samuel I want scripture for that
[1:45:05] Jude
[1:45:07] my beloved
[1:45:10] keep yourselves in the love of God
[1:45:14] that's responsibility I'll be the same
[1:45:17] in my path no you keep yourselves in the
[1:45:21] love of God
[1:45:22] building yourselves up on your Most Holy
[1:45:26] Faith what's the most Holy Faith not
[1:45:29] your faith it's God's faith behind your
[1:45:31] faith so what is it it's building the
[1:45:34] stature of a perfect man it's Christ
[1:45:36] coming forth in our life it's growing
[1:45:38] more into His Image so building
[1:45:41] yourselves up how do I build myself we
[1:45:44] have access
[1:45:45] to the word of God that's been stored up
[1:45:48] we have access to the nutrients in this
[1:45:51] hour God knew there would be a battle in
[1:45:54] this hour and God has provided what you
[1:45:57] and I have need of
[1:45:59] the battle might look great but what do
[1:46:01] I do build myself up
[1:46:04] on your Most Holy Faith
[1:46:07] praying in the Holy Ghost
[1:46:11] oh Jude knew what he was talking about
[1:46:13] why he roped up that book and said how
[1:46:17] good that you would earnestly contend
[1:46:19] for the faith that was earnestly
[1:46:22] delivered to the Saints what is the
[1:46:25] faith it's God's own life the baptism of
[1:46:28] the Holy Ghost I would you would
[1:46:30] earnestly contend for it you knew what
[1:46:33] it was to fight for the right things
[1:46:37] God don't let me be caught fighting for
[1:46:39] the wrong things let me fight for the
[1:46:40] right things if I'm going to give my
[1:46:42] energy I want to be fighting for the
[1:46:44] right things
[1:46:46] are you hearing me
[1:46:49] Feel Me Lord afresh
[1:46:53] Feel Me Lord afresh
[1:46:55] amen
[1:46:57] brother Samuel I just feel like if I've
[1:46:59] gotten maybe a little bit loose that's
[1:47:01] where brother Brown describes he says
[1:47:03] you take that buckle and he said when
[1:47:05] you feel like you've got a little lacks
[1:47:07] in your Christian walk just tighten up
[1:47:10] the buckle
[1:47:12] come on now I'm quoting to you
[1:47:14] tighten it up and say Lord I need a good
[1:47:17] refilling of the Holy Ghost
[1:47:19] why because I'm on a journey
[1:47:22] I'm not eating this word preparing to
[1:47:25] stay here in Egypt I am eating this word
[1:47:28] I have been dressed I have been clothed
[1:47:30] I have been anointed and I got Baroda
[1:47:33] but deity of Jesus Christ and I'm here
[1:47:36] I'm ready at a moment's notice
[1:47:39] to be caught away
[1:47:41] I'm eating this word I'm expecting as
[1:47:44] I'm eating this word as I'm feasting on
[1:47:47] this word it might be what I'm setting
[1:47:49] to church it might be why I'm listening
[1:47:50] to a message it might be while I'm at
[1:47:52] work and I'm meditating on the things of
[1:47:54] God and hear the sweep of the Holy
[1:47:56] Spirit comes over
[1:47:58] what happens Enoch I'm gone
[1:48:02] we're gone
[1:48:03] [Applause]
[1:48:06] don't let nothing
[1:48:08] nothing
[1:48:09] stop you
[1:48:12] well I don't know if I don't let nothing
[1:48:14] stop you
[1:48:17] nothing holds you back
[1:48:20] if you don't have it press in and get it
[1:48:23] press in why it's time to make sure you
[1:48:26] got oil in your lamps
[1:48:28] it's time to make sure you got oil in
[1:48:29] your lamps it's time to make sure
[1:48:31] they're trimmed and burning why because
[1:48:33] the bridegroom announcement has already
[1:48:36] been made
[1:48:39] we're at the Midnight Hour
[1:48:42] we don't know how many more days how
[1:48:44] many more services how many more times
[1:48:46] that's why it's time to say nothing else
[1:48:49] matters
[1:48:51] when we stand there on the other side
[1:48:53] that day and stand in the love of God I
[1:48:56] ask you right here this morning tell me
[1:48:58] when we stand there on the other side if
[1:49:01] you plan on being there you've got to
[1:49:02] have that life in you right now but when
[1:49:04] you get there on the other side the
[1:49:06] things that seem to matter right now
[1:49:08] will not matter
[1:49:12] so if they won't matter then
[1:49:14] why let them matter now
[1:49:21] how should I pray
[1:49:24] Our Father Who Art in Heaven have it be
[1:49:29] thy name
[1:49:31] thy kingdom come
[1:49:34] thy will be done
[1:49:36] in Earth even as it is in heaven
[1:49:42] give us this day our daily bread
[1:49:46] lead us not into temptation
[1:49:50] is that right
[1:49:53] forgive us
[1:49:55] as we forgive those who trespass against
[1:49:58] us
[1:49:59] and Deliver Us from Evil
[1:50:01] for thine is the kingdom the power and
[1:50:06] the glory forever and ever amen
[1:50:13] so how should I be praying
[1:50:18] let that character from the other side
[1:50:22] move down here Lord
[1:50:25] because what happens then it sweeps away
[1:50:28] all the this really matters
[1:50:31] it sweeps it away
[1:50:33] sweeps it away I tell you friends when
[1:50:35] we find the ones out but the same what's
[1:50:37] the secret what's the secret in your
[1:50:39] life as a pastor the Holy Ghost
[1:50:41] that's what's a secret is is staying in
[1:50:44] his presence even when you don't know
[1:50:45] what to do oh that's especially the time
[1:50:47] when I don't know what to do is to stay
[1:50:49] in his presence and let what let him
[1:50:52] sweep let him move let him direct
[1:50:54] because this is not my church it is not
[1:50:56] my body I know it gets referred to over
[1:50:58] to the Samuel's Church it ain't my
[1:51:00] church it's his church it's his body you
[1:51:03] are not Redeemed by my blood or by my
[1:51:05] sweat we have been redeemed by the blood
[1:51:07] of Jesus Christ we are the his purchase
[1:51:10] he has rants from his blood for you and
[1:51:13] I and sent the Holy Ghost to call us to
[1:51:17] himself
[1:51:19] oh what Glory
[1:51:21] what Glory
[1:51:23] how precious I say Lord
[1:51:26] refill a sword
[1:51:30] for hearts it's never been filled film
[1:51:32] Lord let them see that real Victory
[1:51:34] that'll stabilize their lives let them
[1:51:37] see that rather say no what must it be
[1:51:38] it's got to be something you desire
[1:51:39] you've got to see your need you've got
[1:51:41] to see the part like Jacob saw in his
[1:51:43] own life Jacob realized he had had an
[1:51:46] encounter with God but that one
[1:51:48] encounter did not change him he was
[1:51:50] still Jacob he still pulled the same
[1:51:52] kind of deals he still acted the same
[1:51:54] way he was a deceiver is that right but
[1:51:58] when he came back and what was it it was
[1:52:00] God that told him let everything else
[1:52:02] turn around him labor who had been his
[1:52:06] buddy his father-in-law his countenance
[1:52:08] changed toward Jacob and Jacob God spoke
[1:52:11] to him and said come back to the land of
[1:52:13] Bethel you know what it was you might
[1:52:15] sit here as a young person or as an
[1:52:17] older person and you say I've
[1:52:19] experienced God before in my life that
[1:52:22] experience was necessary because why you
[1:52:24] can come back to a place and say Lord I
[1:52:27] experienced you this way I know you're a
[1:52:29] living God but I need you to change me
[1:52:32] from Jacob to Israel
[1:52:34] [Applause]
[1:52:36] what is it you know there's a living God
[1:52:38] he's touched your heart he's touched
[1:52:41] your life but Lord I want to meet the
[1:52:43] god of Bethel
[1:52:45] the god that can change that of Jacob
[1:52:48] and bring forth Israel
[1:52:59] what a mighty God we serve
[1:53:02] oh
[1:53:04] I'll tell you it's a quickening power
[1:53:07] comes to do what to Lift Us

[1:53:14] lift up
[1:53:15] lift up your life lift it up to the Lord
[1:53:19] and say the Lord take me Lord take all I
[1:53:22] am let the consuming fire of the Holy
[1:53:25] Spirit Lord let it come down for our God
[1:53:29] is a consuming fire but the Samuel what
[1:53:31] must it be it's got to be where you are
[1:53:33] tired of trying to dress Jacob up trying
[1:53:36] to make Jacob livid trying to make Jacob
[1:53:38] do right and making excuses for all of
[1:53:40] Jacob's habits and say Lord I just need
[1:53:44] you Lord I'm tired of being Jacob
[1:53:47] I want to be changed
[1:53:50] that's the promise that belongs to us
[1:53:54] hallelujah how will it come you'll have
[1:53:56] to press that means it'll have to be
[1:53:58] with all that's within your heart that
[1:53:59] you want it because when you want him he
[1:54:01] said if you seek me with all your heart
[1:54:04] then I will be found
[1:54:08] of you
[1:54:10] let's pray
[1:54:12] Lord Jesus
[1:54:16] Lord
[1:54:17] our commitment Lord is always to follow
[1:54:21] your leading that's our desire Lord
[1:54:24] father
[1:54:25] you see Lord Jesus right here this
[1:54:28] morning there Lord we are sitting here
[1:54:30] not as a people without needs but rather
[1:54:33] Lord we are a people that are very
[1:54:36] we're very needy Lord
[1:54:39] and father
[1:54:41] there's lives and hearts Lord no doubt
[1:54:43] setting here
[1:54:45] some streaming some will archive it
[1:54:48] Lord I pray that God as you
[1:54:50] in other situations Lord where we've
[1:54:53] witnessed you never even let boundaries
[1:54:55] distances Dwelling Places you never let
[1:54:58] that stand in the way for a heart that's
[1:55:01] really crying out and hungering for you
[1:55:03] Lord I pray right here this morning Lord
[1:55:05] May there be such a determination that
[1:55:08] would strike a Heart Lord
[1:55:10] that father as they can look and see
[1:55:13] that God how that you are making
[1:55:15] yourself known by by the revealing of
[1:55:18] your word your character your nature and
[1:55:20] what you're calling to Lord in each of
[1:55:23] Our Lives that Lord it would rise within
[1:55:25] their hearts Lord to really surrender to
[1:55:27] you Lord May Lord it not leave them Lord
[1:55:31] may it be Lord that of it real
[1:55:33] determination like Jacob oh God the
[1:55:36] wrestling outlord was where Jacob was
[1:55:39] dying to himself
[1:55:42] that Lord you might fully bless him
[1:55:47] and change him
[1:55:49] Grant him Lord
[1:55:52] and I pray father this morning
[1:55:55] Lord throughout this building
[1:55:58] once the Lord of heart
[1:56:01] and a life has met you
[1:56:03] well we're not just courting anymore
[1:56:08] but Lord we've been United
[1:56:11] in a union
[1:56:13] as bride and groom
[1:56:16] and what you prayed for
[1:56:18] I would
[1:56:20] that where I am
[1:56:22] they may be also
[1:56:25] Lord that desire was not just to dwell
[1:56:28] in the future home
[1:56:30] but Lord it was to dwell in Heavenly
[1:56:33] places right now in Christ Jesus
[1:56:38] and that was a prayer you asked for our
[1:56:41] fellowship
[1:56:42] you asked for our companionship
[1:56:46] and Lord it truly is a delight to our
[1:56:49] hearts when we think of that
[1:56:51] but I'm sure Lord
[1:56:54] just as within every marriage every
[1:56:55] husband and wife we know how that is
[1:56:58] here sometimes the Lord the cares of
[1:57:00] life
[1:57:01] sometimes Lord things that we don't
[1:57:03] realize little things can slip
[1:57:05] little things Lord of just Lord little
[1:57:08] gestures and little things Lord of time
[1:57:12] we just Lord not meaning to
[1:57:15] but in the course of this life we can
[1:57:18] become so busy
[1:57:19] and where we have to sit down sometimes
[1:57:21] and say
[1:57:23] hey who are you
[1:57:27] and we have to become Lord reacquainted
[1:57:30] oh we've said at the dinner table
[1:57:31] we talked
[1:57:34] we've sat down and maybe just passing by
[1:57:37] drinking coffee with one another
[1:57:39] but Lord
[1:57:41] sometimes Lord as we realize wait a
[1:57:43] minute in the busyness of life
[1:57:46] we need a heart to heart
[1:57:48] and Lord Jesus
[1:57:50] foreign
[1:57:52] that's the Lord in our lives Lord
[1:57:55] as we come into those places and you
[1:57:58] don't you don't come Among Us like this
[1:58:01] to condemn us but you come Among Us the
[1:58:04] Lord
[1:58:06] to whisper
[1:58:08] to speak to us
[1:58:10] to draw us Lord
[1:58:12] out of a Gloom
[1:58:14] to draw us
[1:58:16] Lord we can Lord we rise from our hearts
[1:58:18] and say Lord
[1:58:19] have I been neglecting you
[1:58:22] have I been letting the Lord just for
[1:58:24] passing by and things just kind of
[1:58:25] passing by but you come and say hey we
[1:58:28] need a heart to heart
[1:58:30] we need a heart to heart no wonder in
[1:58:32] the Song of Solomon it said let us flee
[1:58:34] away into the hills let us take our
[1:58:36] loves hither
[1:58:38] Lord a place
[1:58:40] where we can get away a place of
[1:58:42] solitude a place
[1:58:44] where we can just begin
[1:58:46] to have our hearts just hearing one
[1:58:48] another
[1:58:49] Lord I know that happens Lord God
[1:58:52] father in every marriage Lord It's work
[1:58:55] it's not something that's automatic it
[1:58:58] takes work
[1:58:59] it takes work and it's not something
[1:59:01] that Lord God that we don't like doing
[1:59:04] but Lord Jesus it's what we we love it's
[1:59:07] like Jacob
[1:59:08] when you look at how Jacob served for
[1:59:10] Leah
[1:59:11] he thought he was getting Rachel
[1:59:14] but then when he realized he'd got Leah
[1:59:16] he asked why have I been deceived
[1:59:19] but Laban told him and said it's not
[1:59:20] proper us to give the younger before the
[1:59:22] older
[1:59:24] so as he had labored for Leah she being
[1:59:27] a type of the Old Testament
[1:59:29] but here Jacob
[1:59:31] he was made known for seven years you
[1:59:33] must also labor for Rachel and I think
[1:59:36] of what the scripture said it seemed as
[1:59:39] but a few days to him because of his
[1:59:43] love
[1:59:44] for Rachel
[1:59:46] Lord Jesus
[1:59:48] the same to your bride and Lord from our
[1:59:51] hearts
[1:59:52] this is our desire Lord
[1:59:55] it's not lord it's not living by a law
[1:59:58] it's not I have to do this and I have to
[2:00:01] do this and I've got to go to church
[2:00:03] I've got to do this and I've got no Lord
[2:00:06] I pray God let it be this morning Lord
[2:00:10] if there's one that the Lord is still
[2:00:12] under that part of it would you grant
[2:00:15] them Lord the grace
[2:00:16] to move Lord from that place of just
[2:00:19] where it's miserable Lord and let them
[2:00:21] see let them experience the joy Lord God
[2:00:24] that presence that the Lord is all
[2:00:26] around their lives right now that is
[2:00:28] what you desire to do is dwell in their
[2:00:32] lives Lord God to where it's not I have
[2:00:35] to uh I have to but Lord it raises from
[2:00:38] the inside I get to I love to it's my
[2:00:43] desire to
[2:00:45] and it's through that Lord that brings
[2:00:47] this flesh into subjection it's through
[2:00:51] that desire of that inner man on the
[2:00:53] inside that gives an order to this body
[2:00:55] and says I need to borrow your knees
[2:00:57] because I'd like to pray
[2:00:59] it gives an order to this body I need to
[2:01:02] borrow your hands to raise and surrender
[2:01:04] to gesture how my heart is on the inside
[2:01:06] I need to borrow your lips to speak out
[2:01:09] of praise that's from within me I need
[2:01:11] to borrow your feet to get to church I
[2:01:14] need to borrow I need to borrow your
[2:01:17] eyes to read the word of God I need to
[2:01:19] borrow your ears to read the word of God
[2:01:21] I need to this is my desire
[2:01:27] granted Lord God I prayed this morning
[2:01:29] Lord
[2:01:30] right here Lord in her heart to heart
[2:01:32] moment with you Lord that we're Lord

[2:01:38] granted Lord we pray for
[2:01:42] us granted Lord God May Lord refill Lord
[2:01:45] our hearts Lord

[2:01:55] we let too much space of time go between
[2:01:58] Lord it should be daily Lord God lord
[2:02:02] daily Lord God that we ask for refilling
[2:02:04] Lord what it means in our lives Lord God

[2:02:10] hearts Lord it gives us Grace and
[2:02:12] strength it helps us the Lord to look at
[2:02:15] things Lord God not through our own eyes
[2:02:17] not through our own intellect not their
[2:02:20] own reasoning it helps us to look

[2:02:40] desired
[2:02:42] and that's what I'm going to seek after
[2:02:45] that I may dwell
[2:02:47] in the house of the Lord
[2:02:50] forever
[2:02:52] to behold
[2:02:54] the beauty
[2:02:56] of his Tabernacle

[2:03:35] that character of the word that I'm
[2:03:36] beholding Lord I want to see it Lord God
[2:03:40] living in my life Lord I want to see
[2:03:43] more of you Lord and less of Samuel Lord
[2:03:46] more of you Lord God
[2:03:49] where you said ask the father anything
[2:03:51] in my name and I'll do it
[2:03:54] granted Lord we pray
[2:03:56] in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:04:00] thank you Lord
[2:04:01] Hallelujah
[2:04:03] well let me just sing something what's
[2:04:05] on your heart
[2:04:06] amen if you'd like to stand you're more
[2:04:07] welcome to
[2:04:09] Ola can we just worship him a little bit
[2:04:13] let's just let the Holy Spirit just let
[2:04:15] him just saturate down how brother
[2:04:17] Brandon would speak so many times
[2:04:19] in the message
[2:04:21] how that after the word had went forth
[2:04:23] in the reign of the Holy Spirit just
[2:04:25] coming down said brother Samuel why why
[2:04:27] would that be so important well I'll
[2:04:29] tell you why because the word is a seed
[2:04:32] and that seed is went forth
[2:04:35] but you see on the outside of that seed
[2:04:36] it's got a coat on the outside that
[2:04:39] needs to be broke down
[2:04:41] see I don't I don't want to leave here
[2:04:42] with just a seed
[2:04:44] but I want the moisture of the Holy
[2:04:46] Spirit that's here present that's
[2:04:47] brought the word I want him to start
[2:04:49] breaking down
[2:04:50] Lord God let it break down and you
[2:04:52] realize it's not the word that needs to
[2:04:54] be broke down it's my will
[2:04:56] it's my will because the word don't need
[2:04:59] no Perfection the word is perfect but
[2:05:00] what I need is it's the word
[2:05:02] Lord let my will be broke down
[2:05:05] let my will be broke down let my
[2:05:07] thoughts about it be broke down let my
[2:05:10] thoughts rot about this Lord let it just
[2:05:12] saturate you know what it is it's a jump
[2:05:14] start that's what it is
[2:05:17] many times those of you know you've
[2:05:19] taken seeds maybe in school when I had
[2:05:21] to do with the kids you'd put them in
[2:05:23] them brown paper towels
[2:05:25] and you put them little bean seeds in
[2:05:27] there and you'd soak them overnight
[2:05:30] and by the next time the next day you
[2:05:34] come in and those seeds
[2:05:37] you'd be able to start peeling
[2:05:39] the outer coating off
[2:05:41] and it's almost like a translucent a
[2:05:43] transparent you know you can't
[2:05:44] completely see through it but it's like
[2:05:46] that coating on the outside it starts
[2:05:48] coming off
[2:05:51] and so then as you keep it in that
[2:05:53] brown paper towel or it don't look like
[2:05:56] much but you see what that towel does it
[2:05:58] keeps moisture around that seed
[2:06:01] and eventually what happens we would
[2:06:03] open up them paper towels like that and
[2:06:06] you would see a little part of green
[2:06:08] that had started to come out of that
[2:06:10] little bean seed
[2:06:12] but the same how did that happen it was
[2:06:13] in it the whole time
[2:06:15] but what it is something kept the
[2:06:17] moisture around it
[2:06:20] and that's what the Holy Spirit does in
[2:06:22] our life
[2:06:24] it's keeping that moisture around the
[2:06:25] word
[2:06:27] Lord let the word come forth let that
[2:06:29] germ of life let that expression come
[2:06:31] forth Lord
[2:06:33] I just want to stay in your presence
[2:06:36] and we know his presidency we don't
[2:06:38] leave when we leave the church we don't
[2:06:40] leave his presence
[2:06:41] question when we leave one another we
[2:06:43] don't leave his presence he said I'll be
[2:06:45] with you even in you to the end
[2:06:48] and you know even when you clock in at
[2:06:50] work
[2:06:50] you don't have to leave his presence
[2:06:52] he's right there with you
[2:06:54] Jesus doesn't stop at the locker while
[2:06:57] you walk in the plant
[2:06:58] if he's in you he's in you
[2:07:02] you know what that means you can have
[2:07:03] fellowship with him
[2:07:05] at all times
[2:07:06] invite his presence at all times what is
[2:07:09] it doing it's breaking down our will
[2:07:14] so what that the word itself
[2:07:16] might come forth don't you love him
[2:07:20] Hallelujah go ahead brother Brian lead
[2:07:22] us
