amen well we just think full vengence God has given us an opportunity to be able to gather here tonight and we sent out the the email we got that sent out today and I wanted just to kind of address a few things here and the Lord willing on the services on Thursday and Sunday and probably speak on some things that are relative even to and some and some encouragement and guidance for in these times that we are we are in I want to let you know as a church this is not a time of persecution okay this is not a time of persecution as a matter of fact brother Branham would even tell us in the end the question is an answer 64 he's asked a question he gives a very short answer to it and he's asked the question will the church the bride go through persecution like the early church did where the remm said no that's exactly what he said because the promise that we are looking for is rapture and that's could come at any moment we are not waiting as the people of God for this event to take place or that event to take place there's one event but we've been caught up in and we are under anticipation that if any to be caught away of everything within this that we right now are working to try to comply the government has not asked us to do this as far as to mandate that they could have very easily have done that especially you know some of the measures that the state of Ohio has already taken some of the first out of the states to have done that there are certain states that don't even have any reports of this cases of the virus and and we know that you know regardless of of what what is done I think that it would be the best in our interest to comply to what they are asking in this right here as citizens of this country never forget one thing that happened and I always thought this has been one of those experiences that has always stayed with me brother bill was there with me as well as a brother herb and it was in the time when we were in Honduras and a situation we were supposed to have won over the final meetings was in Ermita that night and different ones were travelling even behind us from Tegucigalpa all the way to our Mita we got there and when we turned down in a road you've heard me tell the story we turned down in a road and a man had just shot a man right in the head and he falls out of the truck no maybe no further from us - with him where sister Caroline and sister need are setting but for me I've never seen anything like that in my life I think the only gun I seen was maybe a water gun let alone something like that and I never in and it's so nonetheless it just really you know unnerved everybody and we that was right next to the lane that was next to the the church courtyard how its set up we backed out of there and and thankfully the Lord just watching over us even there we were able to pull into the church and people begin to gather and and just a wailing I never heard wailing before in my life people just started gathering in the I've got bigger and bigger and they're the pastor in in there Mita was he was there and and that different people were coming together and I never forget brother browning what he mentioned in that time he let the brother know he said look he said I don't think it would be wise for us to have service tonight he said but let's do this one thing he said let's just very solemnly not loud but let's just those who were there let's just gather together offer prayer for that family he said because it won't and he said for them here we would be in here rejoicing and there he said the whole community is right there wailing you don't want to add contention and strife two things and so I've always looked at that example and just as the Lord was just kind of quicken it to me you know in different times and and even right now I know that we walk in that we go around parking lots and sometimes you see where there's still cars that are out and things like that and people have to attend to different businesses and so forth but I think it would be the best thing after prayer just looking at it that we just we just comply with it they've asked for 15 days and and and thank God one thing i thankful for is that we already have the capabilities to at least do the streaming so I'll be standing here the Lord willing we'll have a song service and and I'll minister the word of the Lord during this time and the Lord willing we should be able to resume because they've only given the 15 days we should be able to resume on Thursday April 2nd the other the other part within it is that we've mentioned that within prayer request if there's any to be submitted because I'm not just talking to it those who are here I know online if there's prayer requests to be submitted just submit them through the email address we gave and that will that will then be read during the services because we want to bring those before the Lord in prayer as well as continue on as usual if there's anything with Facebook any urgent prayer requests we want to be able to bring that before the Lord and the Saints of God is and you can you could contact my wife she can get that posted there right away also I had mentioned on there you know I'm thankful that we're able to do the streaming and those things we've never had to do anything like this before I really don't I don't I don't recall anything we've ever had to do like this so it's kind of some uncharted waters but but God is faithful to help us and navigate through them I'm just glad that we can still maintain in contact and be able you know to deliver the word of the Lord even during this time and tried to stay as much as we can connect it together as a body of believers and I know it's not the same even at times where I've not been able to be here and I've had the stream it's it's it's not the same and it certainly won't be the same with me preaching the pews because I'm not I'm used to preaching to a lively congregation that really just pulls on the on the word of the Lord and just really loves the Lord and so I believe God will help us and give us what we have need of to encourage us in this time I tell you I think God has really just like the service here on Sunday it was as every service but it was so timely of what the Lord would Minister to our hearts because you and you look at the scripture that brother and Nathan was reading there and I just had told him before I said you know when I walked up here I said I had on my mind to talk to the people about peace I said but I just couldn't get to it but you see God knows that inspiration and no doubt that inspirations what's on your heart - I told him I said I just had that those hold those scriptures I had just rehearsed those scriptures before praying for brother the other night over the phone and and we just thank God for His mercy just God is so he's so personal I don't know how many times we say that but I still I just I'm always amazed and I love to see how God just comes by with her special delivery you think Lord there's another special package for me yep another one another special delivery with your name on it it's just so precious and you know I think tonight brother Mark Schaefer we want to continue remember him in prayer he's at home and the Lord has has been with our brother there's been some bumps in the road but yet nothing that takes our eyes off of the final expectation of complete healing amen the scripture said they shall recover it didn't talk about all the little things in between but we have to promise they shall recover and in a recovery is healing and for sister barb here we thank God for His mercy just touching sister barb and we with just everybody that knows just been rejoicing and and and how did the Lord move for her she was sitting in a doctor's office and then before she ever seen the doctor she said I believe my heart I believe it's right back in line right now and God just put her on her her her heart right back in line let me just say this to you right now and that go and that came out like that among other testimonies you watch what God is doing and will continue to do in the midst of even times like this he shows his love and his care amen sometimes well you know it was a no for sister barb here it comes down to maybe like the last moments or the last hour but God's always right on time and you know these are witnesses and testimonies for us that no matter what we might be praying for is nothing is is is we're not down to the finish until God until God steps in until God says and so we just look at that sometimes they don't come in the time we're looking for it but nonetheless as a believer we know when we've prayed and asked the Lord we know expect those things that we prayed for and God is always so faithful with that also in that email I mentioned and I want to mention to to everyone we you know over the course of the time there are things that are still necessary that even when we're not here on a regular basis we're the church things are still running to maintain curtain current temperatures and things like that so in gave an address where we would have a box that at least secure so in order to continue to support the ongoing expenses even during this these times here I know some people you know they they maybe they do all of their tithes and offerings right the first of the month or somebody does in a second however you do it if need be during that time don't forget to continue to support the church if you've already done what you normally do during during a month well then you you know this wouldn't apply to you but if at any rate you're able to send them to that address right there so and I want to say it like this you know this is not what we did with this right here we certainly somebody said brother send me are you afraid no I'm not afraid at all I'm not afraid I think God what peace what comfort you know are you worried about you know if they don't have a hand sanitizer wipe when you go to to put your hand on the shopping cart no no I'm not at all because it not that we're being ignorant of it but we understand that within everything that we're looking to the Lord in prayer because I don't have no doubt I mean you know the hand the cart might have been sanitized and I may have that white but who knows who I'm walking next to in the store who knows what they have who know and this has been going on I mean this isn't just something you know we're talking about something now but in everything let us remain steadfast to trust the Lord I just give you a little testimony you know my wife and I we we went out you know on on Monday which you know we have our groceries or we'll pick them up there you know once out of the week we for us we kind of just we just do the weekly shopping trip you know and uh because maybe my taste buds can change from week to week and so you know we we do that put our menu together and then we just she orders the stuff and gets it from the store they weren't doing that this week you know for us to pick it up and sometimes that's worked out good for our schedules because she can call me and say hey will you stop and pick this up and they just put it in your trunk for you that's kind of nice you know but anyhow they're not and I understand all that but you know we were just looking at it and I told the boys on Sunday night I said you know because for them and this was all ties in for them I told them I said you know I think I said in our praying and said we need to really evaluate how we're praying I said because we I was praying for them and not for the rest of the school kids there's there's a part of it that probably with teaching how if I was still teaching how to did a little praise break at first but I'd have been a little bit upset because when it gets down to the testing time I didn't want no days out of school but for them in college where they're at they wanted to be there they wanted they they just felt hey I want to be there to where I can interact with them and so we were kind of praying in that direction but then when I started looking at it I said you know we I think we need to pray and like you this in this manner and that is look for the Lord just to guide us through this time because we don't have any timelines on this we have right now the 15 days that they just came out with but other than that we just need the Lord to guide us through it and look for the blessing within it and I tell you what there's been blessings already that for them by God's grace that's been coming out but then the part with the shopping when a wife and I were able to go to the store and you and you know it was just a first I didn't know I was gonna see I thought boy is it gonna be just bare shells everywhere you know I didn't know and and and of course and our Walmart that's normal but and we went in how we we got out and and and and we went to to target there she said let's just try there I said well okay so we got in there I'll tell you what we found what everything we had meet up on our weekly list now that may not seem like much but for me it was a whole lot because it just shows that you know what I have found even before this term of coronavirus or whatever more that every time that we've had a need God has supplied that need and they've been something that sometimes that you know might seem silly to you but there's certain times I don't want to pay a price on a certain shirt or a time and I just don't want to pay it I just said Lord well you you know what I have need of it you just provided and you know what there it'll be clearance and they get a good price and I just think God for it I've really prayed that way and so God is faithful God is faithful through it all we just wanted we want to stay focused and just look to him the Lord was certainly and he is making a way through through all of this and through it all within our lives we cannot determine what the world is doing but in our lives in our hearts we can look to the Lord for the blessing that God has in it for our lives of how that our lives might be further enriched by his presence how that he'll make his word even more real and more sure in our lives so this is certainly not the the streaming is certainly not the ideal setting for us to have a service but I'm thankful we've got this option I really am I'm thankful that God has provided that and we'll have that that running and if anybody has any you know questions you can submit that question you know does anybody have any questions here tonight about anything yet for the Ritchie well the next prayer meeting is March 31st and I just I think we'll just have to see where where where that's at because actually I think that's the 15th day if I'm counting it right so we'll just have to see whether or not we have that I'm kind of looking at we'll just definitely have I think probably we may have to cancel that one I'm not sure and do this the first Thursday we can meet it is April 2nd as a congregation so as a whole congregation those are listening those who will hear it those are here Lord willing April 2nd on a Thursday night we should be able to resume completely meeting back here all together yes good question anybody else did I leave anything out you usually catch everything anybody got anybody else got a question and all it will be recorded and they will be streamed the services so it'll be both it won't just be stream but it also be recorded as well yeah yeah well not all but you know you you'll be able to step in yeah yeah yeah well we won't do that no we'll just stay with it cuz you have to be here and you know probably between you and Paul just have to take it brother bill has to be here he wouldn't know what to do if he can't be here like all of us but I mean bill might be sitting out in the parking lot at 8:30 in the morning just set here I'm just picking with him but I know brother bill he he called me from the church here on Monday morning he was already over here so I just wanted we're allowed to to to have that we've got the different trying to cover the different areas back there to for for these types of gatherings so that's a good question better bill anybody else okay well let's take their requests here to the Lord in prayer brother Danny I don't know if you wrote did you write a request in here okay go ahead why don't you go and say okay okay yeah yeah you know you you you you know yeah you you know yeah yeah you know yeah you yeah you know it's true that a lot of what we see around us where people are being driven with fear and it's it's a shame that those things are allowed to go on in in that you know because you see things I guess in my mind I think of it people buying things that they know there's no way in the world they can use perishable goods and how many of that's gonna how many how much that's gonna get thrown away and people are gonna end up being in debt because they've you know come under fear and these different things like that it's a real I tell you as a people of God it's a time to really to be thankful that we have a place of rest and that we have that to rest in the Lord to know that it's God that is our provider let me just tell you before Corona was it before that that word coronavirus was ever out there before and these other things let me tell you something it wasn't giant ego or Walmart or Target or anybody else that provided your food God has provided our food and that's the real reality and because our wisdom it's God that's provided for us and so you know with that we want to continue to remember I remember the different ones that are even I think of the government's the teachers and the different ones that are attending two different things leaders and things they've got to make decisions and as I continue to quote that to you scriptural pray that we might be able to live peaceably and we understand that so we want to remember Phillip that's was the what brother Danny had mentioned with Phillip his son and had a heart attack the stent did not take and so they blew that out and he's no visitors or anything like that but we want to continue remember Phillip in prayer and we want to remember for the Danny's mother prayer that's suffering from Alzheimer's remember her in prayer I think also for I don't know if it's in here in the in the writings but my father-in-law and mother-in-law they're they're trying to sell their place you know they already have a place up here and they're trying to sell their home down there and so they have a viewing that's coming right now I think was tomorrow morning so we want to just pray that the God will just send the right buyer for them so that they can be able to be here though the full time so we want to remember them in prayer this is a says of prayer for ministers and congregations during this

those people in India China different places okay we have that already let's pray for brother herb he's not feeling well he's congested and weak and sister Rita requests prayer for her loved ones also we want to continue remember lost souls back sliders and and loved ones that you oughta just move upon their hearts as well also pray for sister Maria's she's home and not feeling well so we were in the store the other day and you know my wife I had to sneeze so you know that's not unusual for me that happens no matter what time of the year it is and watch it you know what they have everybody you know looking or whatever well I mean I you know I just found but you know I don't I always cover up you know and things but you know it's just something like this that people are just kind of they are it's let's pray that God will just just help every one of us and I believe even as we were talking with our children and different ones just help each and every one as we're looking to the Lord you know that God will just continue to strengthen us so we've gotten many requests here and is there any others that I that maybe came on your heart you happen to think of during the time brother bill okay yeah yeah let's continue pray for brother Donny Reagan as and also brother Ron Spencer as well go on to just continue to be with them brother Richard yeah brother Carlos Cruz young yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah we're already living in a time where people are looking for stability they look for stability and that and you know the peace of God it's an atmosphere of God about our lives and people are already looking for reality and for stability in lives then even in situations that arise like this may God help us too and in this time that even through this right here to reach that lives might be reached and God is faithful he will see us through let me read this to you let me just read this to you you'll probably hear it from me again but let me read it to you here meant so much to me I happen to think of it today because there's some other things that that even my wife and I had to send out and we had to cancel some other things that we were part of and putting on and we had to send this out so I sent this out to a group of pastors here today and I just brother branham made this statement as this quote came to me brother Branham had made this statement a spiritual fruit in due season he said we feel like that we're going through a great time of distress and trials perplexity of the time and distress between the nations and all kinds of things happening and sometimes I get engulfed everywhere I look it's like I'm on in a ship out on the sea and I've been given charge of the boat how we gonna make it and here comes one with a white cap a hundred times bigger than my ship but will crest every one of them every one we are more than victors through him the captain the chief captain has got ahold of the string on the end of this ship you'll pull it through we'll crest every one of them amen I believe that don't you Amen aren't you glad he's got a hold on your life I'm so glad about we let's take these requests to the Lord in prayer tonight and we spoke just a little bit longer to you into every one than what we normally I would normally would but let's just take these to the Lord in prayer I want to say to each and every one of your congregation we love you god bless you and Lord willing we will be gathered together here on Thursday evening via streaming and Sunday and then next week as well so may God richly bless you and let's just take these requests to the Lord in prayer and just look to the Lord to meet each and every one of these needs we got so much to be thankful for amen god bless you
