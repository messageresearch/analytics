[35:29] being there on Sunday
[35:31] she said
[35:34] she said will you stand with me I want
[35:35] to give my testimony
[35:38] and she had already told me before she
[35:40] said when because she knew I was out a
[35:42] little bit and she said when you I'm not
[35:44] going to give my testimony till you're
[35:45] there and so the enemy wanted to raise
[35:49] his ugly head again
[35:51] on uh what date was that in Linda was
[35:54] that yesterday we talked on the phone we
[35:56] had prayer
[35:57] okay and my days are off it was

[36:21] I hope I can not cry

[36:30] in
[36:32] a lot of them told me they didn't think
[36:35] I was going to make it
[36:37] and when I did
[36:40] the nurse said I want to hug you
[36:44] I didn't think you make it
[36:46] and I say you could hug me
[36:50] and all through I lost my voice my
[36:54] hearing
[36:55] but I just prayed continually
[36:59] in myself
[37:02] and I kept saying
[37:05] I believe your report
[37:10] I believe your report
[37:13] and I would talk to him
[37:16] in silence
[37:18] over and over
[37:21] he's blessed me he gave me a miracle
[37:26] oh it tore me down he's building me back
[37:31] up
[37:34] I had a beautiful family he blessed me
[37:38] with
[37:39] to be right with me when I would say I
[37:43] can't do it I want hospice
[37:47] my daughter would say no Mommy
[37:50] she cried
[37:52] I asked to learn let me stay for my
[37:56] family
[37:57] because I wanted to give up
[38:01] the Lord held me
[38:03] he didn't let me give up he held me he
[38:08] he hugged me
[38:13] he's glorious I could never thank him
[38:16] enough
[38:18] never
[38:20] praise him enough
[38:24] oh he brought me through so much there's
[38:27] too much to say
[38:29] right near death they thought they lost
[38:32] me once
[38:33] they did but he was hugging me
[38:38] they could not lose me
[38:44] thank you for all your prayers
[38:48] thank you
[38:50] I would have never made it I think
[38:52] without prayer
[38:54] I know I wouldn't I talked to him in
[38:58] silence

[39:01] constant because I could not speak I
[39:04] lost hearing and speech
[39:07] for a while
[39:11] but praise the dear Lord Jesus he is on
[39:15] the throne

[39:31] way or another
[39:33] because I was starting to get sick sick

[45:25] amen and amen
[45:28] amen let's turn in our Bibles to Romans
[45:30] chapter 8.
[45:34] amen
[45:54] Romans chapter 8 I'm just going to read
[45:56] a few verses of scripture here verse 31.
[45:58] down through verse 34.
[46:03] Romans 8 31 it says what shall we say
[46:07] to these things
[46:09] if God before us
[46:12] who can be against us
[46:15] he that spared not his own son but
[46:19] delivered him up for us all how shall he
[46:23] not with him also freely give us all
[46:28] things
[46:29] who shall lay anything to the charge of
[46:32] God's elect
[46:33] it is God that justifies
[46:36] who is he that condemneth it is Christ
[46:39] that died yea rather that is risen again
[46:42] who is even at the right hand of God who
[46:46] also maketh intercession for us
[46:50] amen may God bless you bless the reading
[46:52] of the word as you're being seated
[47:00] I'm just going to speak your thought the
[47:02] Lord just is so oppressed on my heart
[47:04] and while I was speaking here on
[47:06] Thursday the inspiration just came right
[47:08] in the midst of that service and then he
[47:10] just and then it just continued to just
[47:13] pick that up on things on Friday morning
[47:15] and I want to just speak on this thought
[47:17] I'm still here
[47:19] he's not finished
[47:22] I'm still here he's not finished
[47:27] the way he came on Thursday night within
[47:29] it was that it was him speaking I'm not
[47:33] finished yet
[47:35] some of you no doubt whether you
[47:37] streamed or you were here you caught
[47:38] that part and how that that transition
[47:40] was in there and you know you just just
[47:43] obey him so I'm still here he's not
[47:46] finished
[47:47] and that was something that I thought
[47:50] Aunt Linda that when you text me I had
[47:53] already been studying this was or had
[47:55] already been here at the church for a
[47:58] number of I don't know hour hours or
[48:00] already more and I thought when she
[48:01] texts me about being here on Sunday and
[48:04] here the Lord's already laid this here
[48:06] on my heart but it's for all of us
[48:08] I mean who can arrange this but God
[48:12] so when you draw this from some of the
[48:15] places on Thursday evening where brother
[48:18] Branham is speaking of this on all
[48:20] things because we we has freely given us
[48:23] all things and one of the things that he
[48:26] has given us is he has even given us
[48:29] death
[48:30] even death as brother Bram says even
[48:33] death we possess death he said think of
[48:37] it possess death he says yes sir it
[48:40] Minds us now remember the minds us of
[48:43] God before us who can be against us he
[48:46] hath free he had delivered his son
[48:48] freely delivered him for us so the whole
[48:52] the whole purpose he's delivering
[48:54] himself that the word itself might come
[48:57] to pass in our life that's the whole
[49:00] work of redemption so now he says yes
[49:03] sir it Minds us so it's minding the
[49:06] purpose of God he said well Glory I done
[49:09] forgot about the explosion of the gun
[49:12] remember brother Branham had had a gun
[49:14] that they had bored out the the barrel
[49:16] for him and brother Branham went out to
[49:19] shoot that gun in the range and the gun
[49:21] itself exploded when he went to shoot it
[49:24] and he talks about how the boat on that
[49:27] gun actually flew clear down to the deer
[49:30] concert Innovation club that was quite a
[49:32] ways away and the barrel shot out 100
[49:34] yards and he says I'm just he's thinking
[49:38] about that explosion that just had
[49:39] happened he says Why didn't it kill me
[49:42] because he couldn't that's why God
[49:46] wasn't ready
[49:48] he could come as much as he want to but
[49:52] he can't take you
[49:53] Glory he said I paid my debt to that a
[49:56] long time ago and when I believed on
[49:58] Jesus Christ who's Alive forevermore now
[50:02] death listens to what we say
[50:05] he said you say brother Branham a
[50:08] possessor of death he said absolutely
[50:10] Paul said that he we possess it when
[50:14] they were fixing to cut off his head he
[50:16] could say oh death where is your sting
[50:18] where is your sting show me where you
[50:20] can scare me death said I'll squeeze you
[50:23] down I'll put you in the grave you'll
[50:25] rotten canker he said but oh thanks be
[50:28] to God who gives us the victory through
[50:30] our Lord Jesus Christ yes sir death Hell
[50:33] In The Grave I possess it all because he
[50:37] conquered it all for us I'm a possessor
[50:40] all right
[50:43] that's good freely giving us all things
[50:47] to where that death death even Minds us
[50:50] because there is a purpose in our lives
[50:55] to be fulfilled
[50:57] now when we look at this brother Brandon
[51:00] when you know make also the statement if
[51:02] you'll just bear with me a moment to
[51:03] just kind of lay this and he's talking
[51:05] about this once again and he says how he
[51:08] says Satan tried to kill me but he can't
[51:12] do it until God is ready for me to come
[51:14] home then I'm ready to go at that time
[51:16] now watch what he says there's some more
[51:19] sick to be prayed for or something to be
[51:22] done
[51:23] now notice here he is he's locked in I'm
[51:26] still here he's not finished yet
[51:30] Hallelujah he goes on in another place
[51:33] and he makes a statement God wasn't
[51:35] through with me yet
[51:37] he says it in another place he says
[51:39] after this explosion the doctor says to
[51:42] him I don't see how your head or
[51:44] shoulders can be on after that explosion
[51:47] so brother bam said I feel by that that
[51:50] the Lord wasn't finished with me yet and
[51:54] maybe he wants me to try to speak a
[51:57] little bit more for his people to try
[51:59] and help and he said I'm here to do all
[52:01] I can do to make life a little easier
[52:03] for you and to try to help the best that
[52:05] I know how so you'll pray for me I'm
[52:07] sure so here he is placed in this he is
[52:10] looking at God spared my life and he's
[52:14] here it is captured knowing Satan would
[52:18] have taken his life but he recognizes
[52:21] within that I'm still here God's not
[52:25] finished
[52:26] so it wasn't I'm just I'm still here and
[52:29] then goes to look at Earthly things that
[52:31] I can still do Earthly things I can
[52:33] still fulfill my bucket list that's not
[52:36] what it's about
[52:38] he said I'm still here he's not finished
[52:41] with me yet because our life is not
[52:44] about us
[52:45] our life's not about us
[52:47] that's what that's what Satan brought to
[52:50] Eve in the beginning is to bring and
[52:53] introduce an anoint with selfishness to
[52:57] where we live for self
[53:00] but because God himself came down and
[53:04] paid the price of redemption blood was
[53:06] shed that now when you and I can be
[53:09] dealt with our life surrendered and the
[53:12] Holy Spirit coming in to bring forth a
[53:16] new man a new woman a son and daughter
[53:18] of God on the inside that then is
[53:21] delivered of selfishness we have to
[53:25] battle it daily but we are delivered of
[53:28] it from within our life from within that
[53:31] new birth because our desire is to do
[53:34] only those things that please him
[53:40] so when we recognize I'm still here he's
[53:43] not finished yet
[53:46] so it's about him why I'm here it's
[53:49] about him
[53:51] so let me just say it in this way Satan
[53:54] would love to send us to a premature
[53:57] grave
[53:59] let me just work with this thought just
[54:00] for a few moments you remember when the
[54:03] disciples
[54:05] Jesus sent them away and they were gone
[54:07] away in a ship to the other side this
[54:10] was after the feeding of the five
[54:12] thousand
[54:14] and they get on the the sea
[54:17] and then there Rises a storm on the sea
[54:21] and brother Bram goes in to describe
[54:23] this Forest that how that Satan begin to
[54:27] blow his poison breath upon the Water
[54:30] because he was going with an intention
[54:33] I'm going to sink them
[54:35] I'm going to drown them
[54:37] and so the waters were responding to
[54:41] that poison breath that's being blown
[54:43] upon them of Satan but remember here in
[54:47] the midst of that time the Bible tells
[54:50] us that Jesus came to them walking upon
[54:55] the Water
[54:57] he came to them and they began to cry
[55:01] wow what is this is it a spirit but he
[55:04] made known to them it is I be not afraid
[55:10] Satan wanted to sink them he wanted to
[55:13] drown them he wanted to take them to a
[55:16] premature grave we without me having to
[55:19] really Define premature we realize that
[55:22] it's something ahead and Before Time
[55:25] so his desire was to do that and but
[55:29] remember when we think of the Lord Jesus
[55:31] brother Brown would point it out he said
[55:33] how did he climb the ramparts of Glory
[55:36] he is seated there at the right hand of
[55:39] God seated in power and authority he's
[55:41] watching over his church uh you know
[55:45] even when they took Peter that time and
[55:47] they were looking like it looked like
[55:49] Peter's life He's Surely a goner but God
[55:53] wasn't finished with Peter yet and it
[55:55] was the church notice how God is working
[55:58] the church is praying for life we are
[56:01] always in the will of God when we are
[56:04] praying for life
[56:07] okay
[56:08] are you hearing me we're always in God's
[56:10] will when we're praying for life it
[56:11] doesn't matter what the situation looks
[56:13] like we are always in God's will when we
[56:16] are praying for life
[56:19] I go through many examples there but
[56:21] brother Brown's Ministry but in any and
[56:23] any rage hear that hear the disciples
[56:26] were praying they had gathered there and
[56:28] they were praying and remember the angel
[56:31] of the Lord went and went right to where
[56:33] Peter was at and loosened him from the
[56:36] inner prison
[56:39] and led him out of the city and then
[56:43] directed him back to the house there and
[56:45] when Peter went and he knocked there at
[56:47] the house remember as he's there you
[56:50] know they've been praying for it but
[56:52] it's so overwhelming to them they opened
[56:54] the doors Peter oh there must be what is
[56:57] this you see what it shows you and I
[56:59] that even in the humanity sometimes
[57:01] we're praying but it shows there's
[57:03] something deeper than our Humanity
[57:05] that's praying it's a son and daughter
[57:07] of God that's on the inside as a matter
[57:09] of fact when we pray in the name of
[57:11] Jesus Christ it is Jesus himself praying
[57:14] through US ask the father anything in my
[57:17] name and I'll do it they were astonished
[57:20] oh my goodness the prayer has been
[57:22] answered in this way
[57:24] [Music]
[57:26] Hallelujah they thought for sure Peter's
[57:28] already entered into the theophany and
[57:30] come back to visit us but it wasn't that
[57:32] way God was not finished with Peter yet
[57:37] Hallelujah so when we see this Brethren
[57:41] would talk about them on the on the on
[57:42] the sea and he said how the devil he saw
[57:46] God saw that the devil was about ready
[57:48] to get him and he said the devil is
[57:50] about ready to get you off brother I'm
[57:52] talking he says it's just about ready
[57:54] you're going to a premature grave some
[57:57] of you going as a sinner if you don't
[58:00] repent
[58:01] some of you will go premature because
[58:04] Satan sickness has set in and gripped
[58:07] the life out of you
[58:10] now notice what he's saying he's saying
[58:13] that there that there is a premature
[58:15] grave and he said some of you are going
[58:17] to go that direction as a sinner if you
[58:20] don't repent
[58:22] I think as a church we should know but
[58:25] sometimes we have to in mind of what is
[58:28] repentance repentance is just not
[58:31] sitting in a church repentance is not
[58:33] just acknowledging what's truth
[58:35] repentance is where you are crying out
[58:38] to God forgive me Lord I am a sinner and
[58:42] I need saving
[58:45] that's repentance it doesn't matter how
[58:47] good you are because no matter how good
[58:50] we are our goodness is nothing but
[58:52] filthy rags in his sight
[58:56] the Bible tells God had commanded man
[58:58] everywhere to repent
[59:01] that's one of the greatest things that
[59:04] God ever brings along our pathway is
[59:06] repentance
[59:08] that's what Jesus Christ being set forth
[59:12] when he's preached in the reality of his
[59:14] person it's something that grips your
[59:17] heart it's not listen we all can be here
[59:19] and we all have experience no doubt you
[59:22] can come across and people sometimes
[59:24] they are repentive but the repentive is
[59:26] not godly repentance they are worldly
[59:29] repentive in other words they're just
[59:32] sorry for the situation they're in oh my
[59:35] wife left me or this happened to me oh
[59:37] this is so terrible and it is terrible
[59:39] but that's not repentance
[59:42] repentance is you recognize I need God
[59:48] I need God
[59:50] Hallelujah
[59:52] sometimes God will allow situations to
[59:55] bring us into a place drive us to where
[59:58] the purpose now can be fulfilled
[1:00:01] notice in future home brother Brian once
[1:00:03] again I want you to watch High words
[1:00:05] this year he said Lord we pray that you
[1:00:07] would forgive our sins and maybe turn
[1:00:09] our attention toward the Eternal things
[1:00:11] and the life that lays Beyond this
[1:00:13] Mortal reach we pray that you'd give us
[1:00:16] your directions of how we must turn and
[1:00:18] what we must do in the future even in
[1:00:20] the presence now he said Lord there's
[1:00:22] many sick and needy in the land listen
[1:00:24] to this and they haven't completed their
[1:00:27] Journey
[1:00:28] and our great enemy not only our enemy
[1:00:31] but your enemy has come to beset them
[1:00:35] and to stop their life and descend them
[1:00:38] to a premature grave and we're asking
[1:00:41] for them today that you and your mercy
[1:00:43] and Grace Lord will extend their days to
[1:00:47] the allotted time
[1:00:50] and you would think wait a minute here
[1:00:52] God we're praying and asking God to
[1:00:56] extend our days until the allotted time
[1:00:58] that's why when even when you see sister
[1:01:01] Linda standing right here when she tells
[1:01:04] you they would get given up on her
[1:01:09] are you hearing me even when she said uh
[1:01:12] you know I was ready tell them call
[1:01:14] Hospice as a matter of fact she said
[1:01:16] that
[1:01:19] but prayer went up
[1:01:22] prayer went up
[1:01:24] did you hear me prayer went up
[1:01:27] you want to know if God answers your
[1:01:29] prayer look what was standing in front
[1:01:30] of you
[1:01:32] God answers your prayer well you say
[1:01:34] that was brother and sister so and so
[1:01:36] you tell that lion devil to get off your
[1:01:38] shoulder
[1:01:40] that's right brother Sammy I'm not that
[1:01:42] strong a Christian let me get some
[1:01:43] quotes going right now brother random
[1:01:45] told us that he said God showed you and
[1:01:48] I that when the weakest Christian would
[1:01:51] go to their knees in prayer Satan
[1:01:54] trembles
[1:01:56] let the devil say you're nothing but a
[1:01:58] weak Christian but I got a great big God
[1:02:02] he's done a great work in my life he's
[1:02:05] working in my life it's not me answering
[1:02:07] prayer I'm looking to him
[1:02:11] he's the one that directs the issue
[1:02:14] you just ought to square your shoulders
[1:02:16] back and say food devil
[1:02:20] come on Friends
[1:02:23] Hallelujah so we'll extend their days
[1:02:26] remember job said that our days are
[1:02:29] determined our months are with thee
[1:02:33] there was God
[1:02:35] God has that all set forth as far as
[1:02:38] this this journey in time
[1:02:42] God has that
[1:02:43] we can't cross those bounds but remember
[1:02:46] what job would say turn from him
[1:02:49] turn from him that that he might
[1:02:51] accomplish his day as a hireling as a
[1:02:56] servant
[1:02:57] and we certainly are thankful for the
[1:02:59] mercy of God that realizing why we're
[1:03:02] here I'm still here he's not finished
[1:03:07] God did not keep me here so that all of
[1:03:09] a sudden I'd Excel to be the CEO of the
[1:03:11] company that's not why I'm here that's
[1:03:14] not why you're here
[1:03:15] oh God has kept me here that you know
[1:03:17] that I might purchase a big Ranch that's
[1:03:19] not why you're here
[1:03:22] I we are here because he's not finished
[1:03:29] there's a script apart in this drama
[1:03:32] that only you
[1:03:36] are the one
[1:03:37] that can fulfill it
[1:03:39] because it's him fulfilling it through
[1:03:41] you
[1:03:42] and you can't go off stage until this
[1:03:45] part has been fulfilled
[1:03:48] so our being here now I want to just
[1:03:50] draw this in very clearly our being here
[1:03:53] is all centered around the purpose of
[1:03:56] God
[1:03:58] in fact brother Brandon would say it so
[1:03:59] clearly indeed if Jesus Christ if we
[1:04:02] fail
[1:04:03] if in this lifetime everything else that
[1:04:06] we do and we fail to repent and be born
[1:04:09] of the spirit of God he said we have
[1:04:12] failed the purpose that God brought us
[1:04:14] on Earth for
[1:04:16] that's the purpose to be to be born of
[1:04:20] his spirit so when the purpose of God is
[1:04:22] fulfilled then we go home that's why
[1:04:25] sometimes we can't understand I could go
[1:04:27] through a litany no matter you know from
[1:04:29] ages and things like that that you and I
[1:04:31] could look at and think that doesn't
[1:04:33] make sense
[1:04:35] I mean from servants and ministers and
[1:04:38] young people you could think of things
[1:04:40] it doesn't make sense
[1:04:42] right Sister Mariah if I'm not mistaken
[1:04:45] it comes to my mind now there was just
[1:04:46] uh wasn't in the 28 at the end of 2019 a
[1:04:50] young sister in Arkansas was lost in a
[1:04:52] car accident well how old is she
[1:04:55] 16. I slipped my mind there's those
[1:04:59] things because I remember standing there
[1:05:01] youth retreat praying for the groups of
[1:05:03] sisters that had come from that and
[1:05:05] different ones and how that they you
[1:05:07] were dealing trying to deal with those
[1:05:08] things along with other things that were
[1:05:10] taking place at that time our mind our
[1:05:12] mind cannot comprehend sometimes because
[1:05:15] when we're looking at the purpose even
[1:05:18] in all of our efforts we look at the
[1:05:20] purpose sometimes in our own humanity
[1:05:23] and look let's just be honest and be
[1:05:25] real okay we love the fellowship of one
[1:05:28] another
[1:05:29] even though the purpose of God is
[1:05:31] finished and that one has went on that
[1:05:33] steel does not replace us calling him on
[1:05:36] the phone texting them and saying hey
[1:05:37] meet me for a coffee that does not take
[1:05:39] that away
[1:05:41] but it's something we're able to draw
[1:05:42] strength from
[1:05:44] we're able to draw strength from to know
[1:05:47] that the purpose of God has been
[1:05:50] fulfilled I can't understand it there's
[1:05:52] no way I would even try to to try to
[1:05:55] explain those things even when like I
[1:05:57] said it comes to ministers and
[1:05:58] everything else and so forth that it's
[1:06:00] went on to me in my own mind certain
[1:06:03] things would not make sense but it's in
[1:06:05] God's Great economy
[1:06:07] so while we are here why are we here we
[1:06:10] are here to serve God's purpose now
[1:06:12] brother Brown would bring this out in
[1:06:14] the message things that are to be and
[1:06:16] speak of how that our life has been
[1:06:18] pre-planned by God and brother Bram will
[1:06:20] pick that up and he'll deal with how
[1:06:22] that in our lives that we were within
[1:06:24] our father and our great great
[1:06:26] grandfather remember the scripture tells
[1:06:28] us that when Abraham met Melchizedek the
[1:06:31] Bible picks it up in Hebrews 7 and tells
[1:06:33] us that while Levi was yet in the loins
[1:06:36] of Abraham and Levi that was his great
[1:06:39] great grandfather but it was attributed
[1:06:41] that he paid tithes unto Melchizedek so
[1:06:45] it was recognized that when it would
[1:06:47] come to pass he would also recognize God
[1:06:50] in his generation as well it shows that
[1:06:53] as brother Brown would tie that in our
[1:06:55] life was pre-planned but in order for
[1:06:58] that to come forth in order for our
[1:07:00] lives to come forth brother Raph says
[1:07:03] you were in your father you didn't know
[1:07:05] it neither did you know him at that time
[1:07:07] but then you were put in the betting
[1:07:09] ground in the womb of mother through
[1:07:11] holy wedlock and then you become a
[1:07:14] person expressed in the image like your
[1:07:16] father then there's fellowship and it
[1:07:19] goes on speaking of how God's eternal
[1:07:22] life moving in to your life and he said
[1:07:24] there's a Son of God you had to be in
[1:07:27] him always that Gene of your life
[1:07:29] spiritual life tonight was in God the
[1:07:32] Father before there was even a molecule
[1:07:34] and you're nothing but the manifestation
[1:07:36] of the gene of life that was in God as a
[1:07:39] Son of God now you're expressed after
[1:07:43] his word has come in you notice this
[1:07:46] you're expressed after not before after
[1:07:50] his word is come into you to light up
[1:07:53] this age you are the expression God's
[1:07:57] life in you because you are a son and
[1:07:59] daughter of God he said you get what I
[1:08:01] mean you are now in the lock into this
[1:08:03] right here you are now made you're
[1:08:06] setting in in this church tonight
[1:08:08] because your duty is to express God to
[1:08:13] this nation this people and this
[1:08:16] neighborhood where you associate
[1:08:19] your duty
[1:08:21] my duty is to do what Express God
[1:08:28] to express God
[1:08:31] now faith brother Brown would pick this
[1:08:32] up again in modern events being clear by
[1:08:35] prophecy and he's dealing with how that
[1:08:37] Moses was born with a purpose and he's
[1:08:39] bringing it on down into our lives and
[1:08:42] he's talking about that that Fellowship
[1:08:44] between we were always in our father he
[1:08:46] said but our father could not have any
[1:08:48] fellowship with us from a matur Earthly
[1:08:49] father he said you were there but you
[1:08:51] didn't know it you knew it not but you
[1:08:53] was manifested that he might fellowship
[1:08:56] with you so there's no way then for him
[1:09:00] to have the fellowship with you until
[1:09:03] you are manifesting but we were in God's
[1:09:07] thinking in his thinking we aren't we
[1:09:11] will always were the Eternal thoughts of
[1:09:13] God because his thoughts of himself yeah
[1:09:17] when God thought of you and me what God
[1:09:20] was thinking of is himself becoming
[1:09:24] tangible
[1:09:26] it wasn't God existing with his family
[1:09:29] it's God becoming his family
[1:09:33] hallelujah it's Jehovah Jireh moving and
[1:09:37] drawing and operating and moving into
[1:09:40] the lives that he has already ordained
[1:09:44] it's just like when you're getting ready
[1:09:46] to let's say buy a piece of furniture or
[1:09:48] you're gonna you know maybe there's a
[1:09:50] certain picture you're looking at or
[1:09:51] whatever more and yeah you know what you
[1:09:53] try to do is you try to make room
[1:09:56] I guess you do you try to make room for
[1:09:59] it why because you've already got it in
[1:10:01] mind you know today's the day we're
[1:10:02] bringing that picture home you know
[1:10:04] husband may not know why is this wall
[1:10:05] Bear right here ah there's something up
[1:10:07] the sleeve there's a picture coming to
[1:10:09] that wall now you look in our lives
[1:10:11] there was a place that was already
[1:10:14] reserved to recognize and receive God in
[1:10:18] this hour that place was God himself it
[1:10:22] laid there is a seed as a dormant but it
[1:10:25] was a womb a prepared ground that God
[1:10:28] had made ready that he would receive him
[1:10:30] in this hour in order to be displayed
[1:10:33] because God coming into our life is not
[1:10:36] something that gets put on the back
[1:10:37] shelf but when God comes into the Life
[1:10:39] by a real born-again experience Our
[1:10:42] Lives become the display case of Jesus
[1:10:46] Christ in this hour
[1:10:48] are you with me
[1:10:51] Hallelujah and there is a fellowship
[1:10:53] with him now brother I'm saying it like
[1:10:55] this if you're a son and daughter of God
[1:10:57] you were in God all the time he knew
[1:11:00] what bed and time you'd be planted so
[1:11:02] now you're made a creature a Son of God
[1:11:05] manifested son or daughter of God you
[1:11:08] ready for this
[1:11:10] hello
[1:11:11] you're manifested son and daughter of
[1:11:13] God to meet the challenge of this hour
[1:11:17] to vindicate the true and living God of
[1:11:21] this hour the message that's coming
[1:11:24] forth in this time
[1:11:27] that's what you have been ordained for
[1:11:29] now you and I on our own can't meet the
[1:11:31] challenge but when him he has come in
[1:11:35] and we are made a new creature there has
[1:11:37] stepped in by the new birth it is God
[1:11:40] operating through his word Heaven and
[1:11:42] Earth will pass away but my words shall
[1:11:45] never pass away it is God vindicating
[1:11:48] his word in this hour it's one thing for
[1:11:51] somebody to say this message has been
[1:11:53] revealed to me but it's another thing
[1:11:56] when you can have a Vindication in your
[1:11:58] life this is why when the prophet would
[1:12:01] start with the seals he said not only is
[1:12:03] he here revealing these seals but he's
[1:12:06] here vindicating it and he continues
[1:12:09] that same pattern all the way through
[1:12:11] and lets you and I know if there is a
[1:12:14] true Revelation then it must be followed
[1:12:16] by a true vindication
[1:12:19] very much
[1:12:21] who's vindicating it it's God
[1:12:24] vindicating his word
[1:12:26] Hallelujah Brian give me a little bit of
[1:12:29] more juice up here
[1:12:31] so the whole purpose
[1:12:33] of being here
[1:12:34] is to express God
[1:12:41] but Sammy you mean my whole purpose
[1:12:42] ain't to build up my 401k no I mean the
[1:12:45] Bible tells us The Prudent man looks
[1:12:46] before the future but your life is not
[1:12:48] wrapped in your 401k
[1:12:50] if it is you might want to make sure
[1:12:52] you've got some beneficiaries listed
[1:12:53] there because you may not get a chance
[1:12:55] to enjoy it that's not to scare you but
[1:12:58] do not plan on things that are so
[1:13:01] fragile
[1:13:04] do not plan and we shouldn't make plans
[1:13:07] but do not invade you say well how can I
[1:13:10] not make plans and yet not invest well
[1:13:12] when we're investing we have to
[1:13:13] understand what is it that should be the
[1:13:16] number one investment in our lives
[1:13:20] what's the number one investment seek ye
[1:13:23] first the kingdom of God and his
[1:13:26] righteousness that's not a One-Shot deal
[1:13:28] that keeps on moving in our lives
[1:13:31] brother random when he said I'm still
[1:13:33] here he ain't finished
[1:13:36] not that I'm not finished not that oh
[1:13:38] you know what I'm still here you know
[1:13:40] what I'm not finished I wanted some more
[1:13:41] barbecue I wanted some more steak I
[1:13:43] wanted some more and that's not why God
[1:13:45] extended his life
[1:13:47] he's realizing it why how does he
[1:13:49] realize this because he has been born of
[1:13:52] the spirit of God and what motivates his
[1:13:55] life you say that's because he was a
[1:13:57] prophet then you're telling me he has a
[1:13:59] different life in him than what you and
[1:14:00] I have access to I don't believe that I
[1:14:04] believe the same way that word the way
[1:14:06] that life operates there it'll operate
[1:14:08] in the rest of the body and not only do
[1:14:10] I believe it I am a witness of that I'm
[1:14:13] an experiencer of that that it operates
[1:14:15] in our lives that even when I don't feel
[1:14:18] like it there is something that's
[1:14:20] bubbling up within my soul that helps me
[1:14:23] and says you need to pray boy you need
[1:14:26] to read boy you need to listen to the
[1:14:28] Earth you need to call this you need to
[1:14:30] do this even when my flesh says
[1:14:33] against it
[1:14:35] not against the word but there's
[1:14:37] something that rises up
[1:14:42] aren't you glad there's something that
[1:14:44] can Rise Up In You
[1:14:46] then when there's things that could be
[1:14:49] we could say relatively harmless but the
[1:14:51] spirit of God can rise up in you and say
[1:14:54] be careful
[1:14:55] don't get entangled
[1:14:58] don't get entangled
[1:14:59] because why you ever see anybody fishing
[1:15:01] with a tangled up line
[1:15:03] what's the first thing you do
[1:15:05] foreign
[1:15:09] let's restring this thing and knot it up
[1:15:11] and get the things on there right it
[1:15:13] can't it's hard to fish with a tangled
[1:15:15] up line that's the same thing it's hard
[1:15:17] it's hard to be a fisherman with a
[1:15:19] tangled up line it's hard to serve god
[1:15:22] with a tangled up life
[1:15:25] come on now now listen don't go pointing
[1:15:27] fingers at somebody else oh if it
[1:15:29] weren't from my husband if it weren't
[1:15:30] for my don't blame nobody else on you
[1:15:32] being Tangled Up
[1:15:33] do you realize you can live just as
[1:15:35] Victorious as you desire to live in
[1:15:37] Christ
[1:15:38] stop letting the devil tell you that the
[1:15:41] atmosphere is out here if you've entered
[1:15:43] into the holiest of holies what
[1:15:44] difference does it make if the sun is
[1:15:46] shining what difference does it make if
[1:15:48] the candles get blown out in the Holy
[1:15:50] place you've been lit with the Shekinah
[1:15:52] Glory of Almighty gods
[1:15:56] don't you let the devil tell you your
[1:15:58] Victory is dependent on this you have
[1:16:01] access to Victory in Jesus Christ
[1:16:05] Hallelujah notice how Paul could write
[1:16:09] this in first Timothy chapter 4 and he
[1:16:12] would write of how in his time this is
[1:16:15] preparing for departure and Paul would
[1:16:17] say at my first answer no man stood with
[1:16:19] me all men forsook me I pray God that it
[1:16:22] will not be laid to their charge
[1:16:24] notwithstanding the Lord stood with me
[1:16:26] and strengthened Me That by me the
[1:16:29] preaching might be fully known and that
[1:16:32] all the Gentiles might hear and I was
[1:16:35] delivered out of the mouth of the Lion
[1:16:38] how many knows God still delivers from
[1:16:40] the mouth of lions
[1:16:43] blind Devils lined
[1:16:46] God still delivers from the mouth of the
[1:16:49] light what was the Lions to do to try to
[1:16:51] consume him
[1:16:52] try to take his life prematurely
[1:16:55] but notice where his testimony is God
[1:16:58] delivered me from the mouth of lions
[1:17:03] Verse 18 I love this and the Lord shall
[1:17:06] deliver me from every evil work and will
[1:17:11] preserve me unto his Heavenly Kingdom
[1:17:13] now when Paul writes this remember he's
[1:17:16] just wrote about this above how that he
[1:17:18] was stoned and left for dead he was also
[1:17:20] telling them hey you might want to watch
[1:17:22] out put a bulletin on the on on the
[1:17:24] church bulletin board and put the guy's
[1:17:25] name under there Alexander the copper
[1:17:27] Smith because he did me much harm
[1:17:29] wisdom would say you know what wherever
[1:17:32] he's at right there just kind of go
[1:17:33] around it
[1:17:35] not Shun from it but see God is alerting
[1:17:37] the church in that hour but Paul after
[1:17:40] he's wrote this when Paul was stoned for
[1:17:42] death who delivered him God delivered
[1:17:45] him
[1:17:46] just what Paul was talking about
[1:17:47] Deliverance Deliverance wasn't that God
[1:17:50] was just picking him up like a puppet
[1:17:52] and he wasn't going to have no trials he
[1:17:54] didn't have no heartaches remember Paul
[1:17:55] wrote in the scriptures what I read to
[1:17:57] you on Thursday he wrote to those in
[1:17:59] Corinth I was in death plural often
[1:18:04] off it wasn't just a one-time deal if
[1:18:07] Paul if we were given testimonies in
[1:18:09] church whoever who's had a near-death
[1:18:11] experience you would be able to say you
[1:18:13] know what sorry the rest of y'all Paul
[1:18:15] took up the whole testimony service
[1:18:18] because it had been Time and Time and
[1:18:20] Time and Time Again well no doubt
[1:18:21] sitting right here today there's been
[1:18:23] people been delivered from near-death
[1:18:24] experience there's no doubt even things
[1:18:27] that we and I don't even know of and you
[1:18:29] might say why me I'll tell you why
[1:18:31] you're still here because he's not
[1:18:32] finished with you
[1:18:34] I'll tell you what I can answer that
[1:18:36] question you're here because he's not
[1:18:38] finished with you maybe you're not ready
[1:18:40] to go and God has paired your life
[1:18:42] because you're not ready to meet him
[1:18:45] you're still here he's not finished with
[1:18:48] you yet
[1:18:48] [Applause]
[1:18:49] Oh Glory and the Lord will preserve me
[1:18:52] unto his Heavenly Kingdom this is why
[1:18:54] when brother random would pick it up
[1:18:56] about the wise men and he would talk
[1:18:57] about how the wise men brought those
[1:18:59] three gifts they traveled through all
[1:19:01] those lands where the ishmaelite bandits
[1:19:03] were and when you think of it how they
[1:19:05] traveled through all that it is really
[1:19:07] quite mind-blowing when you consider how
[1:19:10] that they went through all of that with
[1:19:12] these gifts and the treasures that they
[1:19:14] had but yet and not being robbed what
[1:19:17] was that it was the hand of God upon the
[1:19:21] gifts that they had are you hearing me
[1:19:24] now in Washington the men so much as it
[1:19:27] was the gifts they held
[1:19:29] they were inspired by God to bring those
[1:19:33] gifts oh help me now they had had a
[1:19:36] prophet down there and Daniel if you
[1:19:39] were to ask Daniel Daniel could sit
[1:19:41] there and Babylon and say I don't even
[1:19:42] know I'm here I don't know why God has
[1:19:44] brought me here I don't know why God has
[1:19:46] given me favor here while the rest of
[1:19:48] the Hebrew is there why has God giving
[1:19:49] me favor here brother Brian goes in to
[1:19:51] tell us because Daniel was there with a
[1:19:54] message knowing there would be those
[1:19:56] there in that time and Daniel was
[1:19:59] announcing to them there is a coming
[1:20:01] Messiah and a star shall arise out of
[1:20:05] Jacob and that word alone that would be
[1:20:07] there through that time would be
[1:20:09] something that would set within the
[1:20:11] hearts from this generation into that
[1:20:13] generation until there was a group of
[1:20:15] wise men that would be inspired by the
[1:20:18] inspiration of God that was being poured
[1:20:21] out upon that generation and they were
[1:20:24] moved to come with these gifts
[1:20:28] um
[1:20:32] but the Bram says do you understand it
[1:20:34] why God he said has watched over this
[1:20:37] gift
[1:20:39] in this lady of cnh
[1:20:41] he said he says to your church church do
[1:20:44] you understand it why God has watched
[1:20:46] over this gift now this is at the end of
[1:20:48] 63. this is a almost a year later after
[1:20:50] explosion seals have been opened and
[1:20:53] he's announcing to the church trying to
[1:20:54] get him to see hey when we look back
[1:20:56] here at the wise men and see how God
[1:20:58] watched over them all the ishmaelite
[1:21:00] bandits and everything else but they had
[1:21:02] a gift something that God had put in
[1:21:05] their hearts that would declare who he
[1:21:07] was frankincense in service the gold
[1:21:09] deity that have murdered the bitterness
[1:21:11] of death all of those gifts would
[1:21:13] declare him on Earth let me tell you
[1:21:15] something you are ordained by God in
[1:21:18] this hour you are ordained to declare
[1:21:22] almighty God while the rest of the world
[1:21:25] could say he still is not the same uh
[1:21:27] you know these things in sin and
[1:21:29] sickness all it's too deep it's too bad
[1:21:32] but there is a God that your life gives
[1:21:35] a testimony and a witness and Satan
[1:21:38] would love to Snuff it out Satan would
[1:21:40] love to take it but he can until that
[1:21:43] purpose has been served years purpose
[1:21:46] and serving to God you may not realize
[1:21:48] it it might be to your neighbor it might
[1:21:51] be to that factory worker someone along
[1:21:53] the way but God is so fit in it that
[1:21:56] your life is purposed here
[1:21:59] to declare him
[1:22:04] that's why brother Brandon could say
[1:22:06] that's why God has protected it the way
[1:22:10] he has and he will protect it until his
[1:22:13] purpose is served
[1:22:18] now remember in the scripture where it
[1:22:20] speaks to you and I in second
[1:22:22] Corinthians chapter 5 that if this
[1:22:25] Earthly Tabernacle this body that we're
[1:22:29] in that's so frail
[1:22:30] if it be dissolved we have a tabernacle
[1:22:34] already waiting
[1:22:37] it'd be like for those of you who were
[1:22:39] selling your house and you purchased
[1:22:41] another house
[1:22:42] what you're doing is is simply changing
[1:22:45] addresses
[1:22:46] you're moving from one house into
[1:22:49] another house
[1:22:50] so moving from your Earthly house into
[1:22:53] that house that's already been prepared
[1:22:56] for you now I don't want to deal with
[1:22:57] that this morning but in the meantime
[1:22:59] notice how Paul would write of that that
[1:23:01] what we are going to in other words we
[1:23:03] have everything in the world to look
[1:23:06] forward to
[1:23:07] are you with me now listen let me just
[1:23:09] let me just put this on that does not
[1:23:11] mean that we walk around here in life
[1:23:12] and say oh Lord I I just want to go home
[1:23:15] I want to just Lord I want to go home
[1:23:17] and be with you and your wife said honey
[1:23:19] come sit down on the couch with me no I
[1:23:21] just want to go home and be with the
[1:23:22] Lord that's part of the work
[1:23:26] come on now the body calling you know
[1:23:29] call hey come on let's let's sit down
[1:23:31] for some fellowship but no I just want
[1:23:32] to go home to be with the Lord
[1:23:35] we want to go home and be with the Lord
[1:23:38] but God has never anointed you to go to
[1:23:42] a premature grave God has never anointed
[1:23:45] you to wish your life away I know look
[1:23:49] look when job was going through things
[1:23:51] job got to a spot in his test and his
[1:23:54] trial shows the weakness that can come
[1:23:57] in our Humanity when Joe can say oh I
[1:24:01] wish the day had never come that they
[1:24:03] said a man child is born
[1:24:06] job even with a trial that took place
[1:24:09] his breath to his wife became strange
[1:24:14] you know what I'm speaking of it became
[1:24:16] strange there was nothing there between
[1:24:19] the trial was so overwhelming
[1:24:22] but God in his grace
[1:24:26] God and His grace are you hearing me now
[1:24:28] job didn't know what was going on but
[1:24:30] the prophet tells us he stood
[1:24:31] flat-footed that didn't mean he ran
[1:24:33] everywhere else he stood flat-footed but
[1:24:35] God has brought me this far I don't know
[1:24:37] what he's doing right now but I am going
[1:24:39] to wait on him
[1:24:41] I'm gonna wait on him
[1:24:45] Hallelujah
[1:24:47] so in the minion in the meantime in the
[1:24:50] meantime when all of this is taking
[1:24:52] place we recognize this you see this is
[1:24:55] why the Liberty God has not anointed us
[1:24:58] to go in that way
[1:25:01] are you hearing me Church listen all out
[1:25:04] here in this world it isn't just here
[1:25:06] all around us depression and anxiety and
[1:25:10] everything oppression all those things
[1:25:12] are around it's not just you know where
[1:25:15] Satan coming you know a children of God
[1:25:19] hello
[1:25:20] but what I'm trying to tell you by his
[1:25:22] spirit is that you're here he's not
[1:25:25] finished yet
[1:25:27] you've got a right to back that devil up
[1:25:29] and say wait a minute here I'm not
[1:25:31] wishing my way along my life away God's
[1:25:34] got a reason that I'm here there's a
[1:25:37] purpose that I'm to serve
[1:25:40] are you with me all these things is real
[1:25:43] depression's real anxiety is real but
[1:25:45] let's not make it a poster God on our
[1:25:47] walls
[1:25:48] are you hearing me church we don't want
[1:25:51] to worship those things oh brother Sammy
[1:25:53] if you only understood it I may not
[1:25:54] understand it to the level of self but
[1:25:57] neither do I minimize it but I am going
[1:25:59] to exalt the Lord Jesus because I know
[1:26:03] that he's the one that helps you he
[1:26:05] helps me daily
[1:26:08] and these the one we need to have
[1:26:10] confession for I don't feel like that's
[1:26:12] the very time you need to confess
[1:26:17] so Paul is saying let me just read what
[1:26:20] Paul goes into in second Corinthians 5 6
[1:26:23] we are always confident knowing that
[1:26:24] while we are at home in the body and
[1:26:26] absent from the Lord we walk by faith
[1:26:29] and not by sight we are confident I say
[1:26:31] willing rather to be absent from the
[1:26:33] body and to be present with the Lord
[1:26:36] wherefore we labor
[1:26:39] that whether we
[1:26:41] that whether present or absent we may be
[1:26:43] accepted of him for we must all appear
[1:26:46] before the Judgment seat of Christ this
[1:26:48] is not the white Throne judgment the
[1:26:50] Judgment seat of Christ is where we all
[1:26:52] appear before
[1:26:53] and give account that everyone may
[1:26:56] receive the things done in this body
[1:26:57] according to what he hath done whether
[1:26:59] it be good or bad
[1:27:03] I want to hear him say
[1:27:05] well done
[1:27:07] right
[1:27:08] I don't want to be like the teacher
[1:27:09] handing back and say hey why'd you skip
[1:27:11] these problems
[1:27:12] well those problems are too hard
[1:27:15] I want to get done I want to go to
[1:27:17] recess
[1:27:18] I want to go lunch that's the most
[1:27:19] important thing for school lunch right
[1:27:20] pizza day
[1:27:23] walking taco
[1:27:28] I know my lunch stuff from school
[1:27:33] and the teacher looks and says what are
[1:27:34] you doing
[1:27:39] we don't want God to stand there on that
[1:27:41] day and say hey not in fear of us being
[1:27:44] turned away at the Judgment seat of
[1:27:46] Christ but God's saying
[1:27:48] why did you why did you why did you not
[1:27:50] press a little bit more
[1:27:53] why did you let little things get in
[1:27:54] your way
[1:27:56] hello
[1:27:58] that's part of the Judgment seat of
[1:28:00] Christ I'm not preaching on that today
[1:28:01] but there's a part of it because
[1:28:02] sometimes we just think man everything
[1:28:04] is gone no we'll give an account
[1:28:08] oh God help us I want him to say Well
[1:28:11] done
[1:28:12] but I don't want to hand him a multiple
[1:28:14] choice for C is the only one circled
[1:28:17] likelihood sees the right answer I I
[1:28:19] there's going to be things on there
[1:28:21] problems I'll have before me brother Ray
[1:28:24] that I will not know the answer to some
[1:28:26] of them I'll have to pray and wait and
[1:28:29] wait and wait I'll come to church
[1:28:31] expecting the answer I'll pray I'll put
[1:28:34] on a message I'll be sitting there and
[1:28:36] I'm waiting for the answer and sometimes
[1:28:37] the answer comes in a way that I'm not
[1:28:40] even expecting but thanks be to God he
[1:28:42] alerts me to it oh
[1:28:44] letter A
[1:28:47] thank you Lord and we normally thank God
[1:28:49] for the answer but we're thankful Lord
[1:28:51] thank you for helping me to
[1:28:53] just be patient Lord thank you for
[1:28:55] helping me to not look around and man
[1:28:56] everybody else going out to recess I'm
[1:28:58] the only guy in here right now
[1:29:02] this is why when brother Bram said we he
[1:29:04] said we want that report to go back to
[1:29:06] Papa and that report to go up that your
[1:29:09] son his whole thoughts is upon you he's
[1:29:13] trying to do everything he tries to do
[1:29:14] is try to please you he's so interested
[1:29:16] in your affair till it's hard to hold
[1:29:19] him down
[1:29:23] help us Lord
[1:29:25] I'd rather be just a little overzealous
[1:29:27] about the father's Kingdom than to have
[1:29:28] no Zeal at all for it I'd rather
[1:29:31] overwork brother Brandon says there's a
[1:29:33] Church of Christ preacher said one time
[1:29:34] I'd rather wear out than rust out that
[1:29:37] is a lot of Truth he said I'd rather die
[1:29:39] in the harness he said you can't do
[1:29:41] anything any worse
[1:29:43] then neglect to try
[1:29:46] it's like you telling somebody hey you
[1:29:49] know maybe they could use your skills at
[1:29:50] this job oh no they couldn't they could
[1:29:52] they couldn't at all they they don't
[1:29:53] they don't pay enough they couldn't do
[1:29:54] this how do you know well you know they
[1:29:56] call so and so they go how do you know
[1:29:58] well because you know how do you know
[1:30:02] you don't know
[1:30:04] hello somebody
[1:30:07] Hallelujah you can't do nothing any
[1:30:11] worse than neglect
[1:30:13] try
[1:30:14] in other words I'd rather die trying
[1:30:19] are you hearing me I'd rather die trying
[1:30:22] let us do all we can with what you have
[1:30:26] to do with
[1:30:28] so God doesn't want you and I looking at
[1:30:30] somebody else oh if I could only preach
[1:30:31] like that brother or if I could only
[1:30:33] sing like that sister or if I can only
[1:30:34] testify like that brother if I
[1:30:36] be who God Made You
[1:30:38] because God's made you that certain way
[1:30:40] for a certain reason
[1:30:45] Hallelujah
[1:30:47] this is why look what Look What the Lord
[1:30:48] Jesus would say remember when they went
[1:30:50] to Gold let me just kind of move through
[1:30:52] these quickly when the Lord Jesus they
[1:30:53] went and here he is getting ready he's
[1:30:55] gone he's had a had a meeting there with
[1:30:57] a woman at the well and you know the
[1:30:58] things that took place there uh they
[1:31:01] went to go get some food some meat
[1:31:03] and when they came back the Lord Jesus
[1:31:07] here he is they were asking him eat
[1:31:09] master and the Lord Jesus said I have
[1:31:13] meat to eat that you don't know of
[1:31:15] they started looking around what's he
[1:31:17] talking who came in did he get me did he
[1:31:19] have some did he have something put in
[1:31:21] the backpack was there something who who
[1:31:22] came and fed him he was he was letting
[1:31:25] them know there's something higher than
[1:31:28] natural meat
[1:31:30] there's something there's a higher
[1:31:32] purpose than natural purposes
[1:31:36] are you with me
[1:31:37] he said my meat is to do the will of him
[1:31:41] that sent me and to finish his work
[1:31:46] in John 5 36 he said I have a greater
[1:31:49] witness than that of John for The Works
[1:31:51] which a father hath given me to finish
[1:31:52] the same works that I do bear witness of
[1:31:55] me that the father hath sent me so had
[1:31:59] given me to finish now notice how is he
[1:32:01] finishing these works now remember Jesus
[1:32:04] is not walking around just doing as he
[1:32:06] pleases
[1:32:09] are you hearing me he's not just walking
[1:32:10] around you know I think I'll heal this
[1:32:12] one you know what I think I'll go down
[1:32:14] there to Lazarus house you know what I
[1:32:16] think I'll go over here to the pool of
[1:32:18] Bethesda Jesus was not walking like that
[1:32:20] this was a restoring
[1:32:22] of what was lost in Eden
[1:32:27] where man had gone out from under
[1:32:30] the full preeminence of God in his life
[1:32:35] and here he is as a son of God
[1:32:38] the Son of God Jesus answered John 5 19.
[1:32:41] you're familiar with it verily verily I
[1:32:43] say unto you the son can do nothing of
[1:32:44] himself but what he seeth the father
[1:32:46] doing so what was coming to pass was
[1:32:48] what he was seeing the father doing then
[1:32:51] do what the son likewise so here look
[1:32:53] think of this you think Satan wasn't
[1:32:55] trying to distract him
[1:32:58] hello
[1:32:59] you think Satan wasn't trying because
[1:33:01] you and I look at things and we think
[1:33:02] man I feel like I've battled
[1:33:04] distractions I feel like the enemy comes
[1:33:06] at me he faced that same thing so don't
[1:33:09] let the devil run you down
[1:33:11] he faced that same thing he faced
[1:33:14] Temptation such as you and I face
[1:33:17] sometimes we look at Temptations and
[1:33:19] we're thinking about all the wrong
[1:33:21] immoral things even the temptation to be
[1:33:24] less diligent
[1:33:27] dilatory just uh you know
[1:33:30] you know
[1:33:31] it's the program of God I'll make it I
[1:33:34] just you know we become that we battle
[1:33:36] through those Temptations
[1:33:39] Jesus had to battle those same things
[1:33:41] distractions to try to do what
[1:33:44] let's just be simple so everybody
[1:33:46] understand it he gives me an example I'm
[1:33:47] going to give it you ever been in a game
[1:33:49] with somebody or been some event
[1:33:51] and you got somebody sitting next to you
[1:33:53] and wants to talk your head off and
[1:33:54] you're there to watch the game
[1:33:57] and they're talking about this and

[1:35:11] to lead this guy to a body change
[1:35:15] I've got to listen to the Inner Man

[1:35:53] distraction to try to get us distracted
[1:35:56] from seeing what's going on now he'll
[1:35:58] come in very steadily he'll come in very
[1:35:59] slowly with things that can seem so
[1:36:02] harmless things that you and I we would
[1:36:04] not question is sin not so whatsoever
[1:36:06] but if he can just somehow get our
[1:36:08] attention just for a little bit
[1:36:10] maybe it's things where family man and
[1:36:12] family families right in line in order
[1:36:14] with God but maybe it sings within those
[1:36:16] things that can be where they're not
[1:36:18] sinful but he just says all I got to
[1:36:20] have is just a moment to keep them
[1:36:21] distracted
[1:36:24] but I'm grateful to God let's just brag
[1:36:26] on him I'm grateful to God that there's
[1:36:29] a greater attraction
[1:36:31] and I'm grateful that there is the grace
[1:36:33] of God that when we have become a little
[1:36:35] bit distracted I'm grateful for God's
[1:36:37] grace that will preach Andre sit down
[1:36:39] and say hey boy get back in step
[1:36:42] get back in Step listen it's not you
[1:36:45] keeping you it's God keeping you
[1:36:48] I'm still here because he's not finished
[1:36:55] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh like
[1:36:58] brother Adam said he said God I said I
[1:37:00] never believed the church was a
[1:37:02] haphazard event Jesus never came to
[1:37:04] Earth in a haphazard way he never died
[1:37:06] in a haphazard way he came for a purpose
[1:37:09] and that purpose was to fulfill the
[1:37:10] Commandment of God that he might
[1:37:12] purchase to himself a church without
[1:37:14] spot wrinkle
[1:37:16] or blemish
[1:37:19] now that same
[1:37:21] what we read in earlier scriptures
[1:37:23] reflects through the bride
[1:37:25] he said I'm come
[1:37:26] the reason I'm here I've got a work to
[1:37:28] do my meat is to do the will of him that
[1:37:31] sent me to finish his work
[1:37:33] you see here was an anointing of his
[1:37:35] life the Redeemer anointing is the
[1:37:37] Redeemer about a redeemer anointing is
[1:37:39] anointing now as it moves in this hour
[1:37:42] is to finish the work
[1:37:45] the Bible said in Romans 9 28 for he
[1:37:48] will finish the work somebody said he
[1:37:51] will
[1:37:53] say it like you believe it he will
[1:37:57] he will finish the work and cut it short
[1:38:00] in righteousness because a short work
[1:38:03] will the Lord make upon the Earth that's
[1:38:05] this message of the hour
[1:38:08] Philippians 1 6 being confident of this
[1:38:11] very thing that he which he done a good
[1:38:13] word
[1:38:16] till the day of Jesus Christ so what are
[1:38:20] we going to do Hebrews 12 1 wherefore
[1:38:23] sing we are compassed about with so
[1:38:25] great a cloud of witnesses let us lay
[1:38:28] aside every weight and the sin which
[1:38:31] does so easily be sent us and let us run
[1:38:33] with patience the race that is set
[1:38:36] before us looking unto Jesus the author
[1:38:40] and finisher of our faith
[1:38:44] now says let us run the race
[1:38:47] of what patience
[1:38:50] endurance
[1:38:53] so things hardships and different things
[1:38:56] will come but run the race with patience
[1:39:00] and sometimes there's trials that comes
[1:39:01] our way
[1:39:03] and when sometimes things comes our way
[1:39:05] it's God letting us know there's some
[1:39:07] things you got in your life
[1:39:09] that you think are pretty valuable
[1:39:11] but God begins to let light be shown
[1:39:13] upon it and you realize
[1:39:17] but this is heavy this this thing's
[1:39:19] weighing me down keeping this bitterness
[1:39:21] in my life man it's weighing me down
[1:39:22] it's keeping me out of Fellowship this
[1:39:24] lack of forgiveness Lord have mercy I
[1:39:26] got to get this thing out of my life
[1:39:27] what is it it is God bringing light upon
[1:39:31] that so that you and I might release
[1:39:33] that weight
[1:39:35] hello now because why it's a finisher
[1:39:38] anointing Upon Our Life That's the
[1:39:41] anointing of this hour the hands of
[1:39:44] jerubbabel have laid the foundation his
[1:39:47] hands shall also finish it we are living
[1:39:50] in the finishing time this is a
[1:39:53] finishing message the mystery of God
[1:39:55] should be finished it is the finisher
[1:39:58] anointing of the Redeemer in our midst
[1:40:02] it's what keeps moving you and I
[1:40:07] the Bible when we read that hear that
[1:40:08] song I Feel the pull then the other one
[1:40:10] brother Paul wrote something keeps
[1:40:12] holding me it's wrote with the
[1:40:15] expression it's God at work in our life
[1:40:18] [Applause]
[1:40:20] Paul could say in Acts chapter 20 verse
[1:40:23] 24 none of these things move me neither
[1:40:26] count I my life dear to myself so that I
[1:40:29] might finish
[1:40:31] my course
[1:40:33] Paul said I can't take Timothy's course
[1:40:35] I can't take time discourse
[1:40:37] I've got to finish my course
[1:40:41] my course I've got to finish it and so
[1:40:43] all these things that are happening Paul
[1:40:45] we're coming after you Paul we're going
[1:40:46] to kill you Paul we're going to do this
[1:40:48] Paul we're going to do that Paul what
[1:40:49] did he say because there was an absolute
[1:40:52] he was so yoked with the word of God he
[1:40:55] said I don't even count my life dear to
[1:40:57] myself in other words I've esteemed the
[1:41:01] working of almighty God more than my own
[1:41:04] life
[1:41:07] foreign
[1:41:10] so that I might finish my course
[1:41:13] what's that what's that say

[1:41:43] Lord
[1:41:43] understand we all go through things
[1:41:46] I'm not diminishing anyone listen
[1:41:48] friends I'm not putting anyone up
[1:41:50] diminishing yours or putting I'm not
[1:41:52] doing that at all but I'm trying to say
[1:41:54] do you realize it may not be a Bible
[1:41:57] verse or a quote that gets your family
[1:41:59] it might be the joy of the Lord matter
[1:42:02] of fact I'm sure that's what it'll be in
[1:42:04] your life
[1:42:07] this message is not a book it's not a
[1:42:10] tape
[1:42:11] it's Jesus Christ
[1:42:13] your duty my duty is to express God
[1:42:22] if you're not full with joy you need to
[1:42:24] come back and get a refilling
[1:42:27] and you know what even if it went down
[1:42:30] about that much I'd say it's a good time
[1:42:32] for a good refilling
[1:42:33] [Applause]
[1:42:36] it's time for a good refilling
[1:42:39] oh yeah
[1:42:40] absolutely friends listen the joy of the
[1:42:43] Lord doesn't mean bubble dancing I
[1:42:45] believe in being I and listen friends I
[1:42:47] believe in being enthused about the
[1:42:48] things of God but the joy of the Lord
[1:42:50] that even in the midst of trial there is
[1:42:52] a joy that passes your understanding
[1:42:54] it's a joy what is it it's the strength
[1:42:57] not your strength not your DNA it's the
[1:43:00] strength of almighty God that in the
[1:43:02] face of adversity that you know who you
[1:43:05] are you know in whom you believe it
[1:43:08] stabilizes you in the middle of that
[1:43:10] situation
[1:43:11] I'm still here
[1:43:13] he's not finished with me yet
[1:43:19] Hallelujah
[1:43:21] I want to be able to stand like Paul
[1:43:24] on second Timothy 4. 6 I'm now ready to
[1:43:27] be offered
[1:43:29] that word offered means
[1:43:32] It's My Life
[1:43:34] to be poured out
[1:43:36] as a drink offering
[1:43:38] I'm ready
[1:43:40] for my lifetime you know why
[1:43:42] because that's what Paul's life was
[1:43:45] that's not just Paul
[1:43:47] that's the call of every believer
[1:43:50] it's pouring out our lives
[1:43:52] for him
[1:43:55] oh if brother Brandon was here I'd just
[1:43:58] do something good for him
[1:43:59] he said if you want to do something good
[1:44:00] for me do something for one of my
[1:44:02] children
[1:44:04] I'm not his I'm not his physical child
[1:44:05] but I am a product of this message
[1:44:09] amen the Holy Spirit has come and
[1:44:11] brought forth and brought forth what a
[1:44:13] son and daughter of God
[1:44:15] and we want to we want to do something
[1:44:16] good sometimes we're looking oh I want
[1:44:18] to do this what for
[1:44:24] do unto the least of these my brother
[1:44:27] then you have done it
[1:44:28] unto me
[1:44:32] I wonder if when we stand before the
[1:44:34] Judgment seat of Christ
[1:44:37] and we stand there and the Lord says
[1:44:39] I tried to anoint you
[1:44:41] to call that brother
[1:44:44] come on friends I'm not trying to be
[1:44:45] getting scared I'm just preaching this
[1:44:46] right now
[1:44:48] I wonder if we can say oh but Lord but
[1:44:50] but you said you were too busy
[1:44:56] I'm still here
[1:44:58] he's not finished with me yet
[1:45:01] he's not finished
[1:45:03] as far as being finished my life as far
[1:45:05] as capped off yeah but that doesn't mean
[1:45:07] that everything's oh I've been sealed
[1:45:09] that no no it's now now what's happened
[1:45:11] when the Holy Ghost has come it is power
[1:45:14] for
[1:45:15] service
[1:45:17] not power for sin
[1:45:19] power for service
[1:45:23] I have fought a good fight I have
[1:45:25] finished my course I have kept the faith
[1:45:31] let me read you one more scripture
[1:45:34] I don't know this scripture this
[1:45:35] scripture has stood out to me for years
[1:45:36] I don't know maybe I'm just simple that
[1:45:39] way but a scripture out of First
[1:45:40] Corinthians 15 where we look behold I
[1:45:43] show you a mystery
[1:45:45] we shall not all sleep
[1:45:48] and you read through all that glorious
[1:45:51] transformation of the body of Believers
[1:45:54] oh my the moving from the terrestrial to
[1:45:58] the celestial and we read of all that
[1:46:00] the very last verse
[1:46:02] let's read it verse 58. therefore
[1:46:07] my beloved brethren
[1:46:10] be ye steadfast
[1:46:12] unmovable
[1:46:15] always
[1:46:17] abounding
[1:46:19] in the work of the Lord
[1:46:22] for as much as you know that your labor
[1:46:25] is not in vain
[1:46:27] in the Lord
[1:46:30] I look at that scripture I've looked at
[1:46:32] that for over and over in that chapter
[1:46:36] Paul
[1:46:39] is riding with an inspiration that what
[1:46:42] we're looking for
[1:46:44] we've got a great expectation
[1:46:46] but until that moment
[1:46:49] let's be unmovable
[1:46:51] let's be steadfast
[1:46:54] are you with me let's be steadfast
[1:46:56] unmovable
[1:46:58] not compromising
[1:47:00] and abounding growing
[1:47:04] abounding in
[1:47:06] the work of the Lord
[1:47:09] he's not I'm still here he's not
[1:47:12] finished
[1:47:13] what is it there's work
[1:47:15] to be done
[1:47:18] oh brother Sammy you're right I've got
[1:47:20] to really work on my 401k I've got no no
[1:47:22] no you're missing the point
[1:47:24] you're missing the point
[1:47:27] if you focus on the right things first
[1:47:29] everything else God will direct you on
[1:47:31] that
[1:47:32] are you hearing me but if you get that
[1:47:35] ahead of God oh friends that's a
[1:47:36] dangerous scenario
[1:47:38] it's got to be God's kingdom first it's
[1:47:40] got to be that spiritual meat first and
[1:47:42] notice abounding in the work of the Lord
[1:47:46] for you know that your labor is not in
[1:47:49] vain in the Lord
[1:47:51] how many remember this that little lady
[1:47:53] and I'm closing here on this let me
[1:47:55] remember that little lady
[1:47:57] she got on her heart
[1:47:59] to do something for the Lord
[1:48:02] and what she wanted to do what came on
[1:48:05] her heart she was a wash woman
[1:48:10] and she got on her heart to go rent this
[1:48:12] stable This Barn
[1:48:15] and clean it
[1:48:19] she got in there and she cleaned it out
[1:48:20] of all the manure all the straw
[1:48:24] she got in there because a burden was on
[1:48:27] her heart
[1:48:28] to have a meeting now she wasn't the one
[1:48:30] who's going to conduct the meeting but
[1:48:32] she got on her heart to rent that place
[1:48:34] and clean it
[1:48:37] and they had a brush Harbor meeting
[1:48:39] right there that in that night
[1:48:43] and you know who came out of that
[1:48:45] meeting here came in here came in a boy
[1:48:47] with long hair bibbed overhauls and fell
[1:48:50] across the altar by the name of the
[1:48:52] white Moody
[1:48:56] you know her name no we don't
[1:48:58] don't know her name but
[1:49:01] here here She was she got a burden and
[1:49:04] think of it she's serving the lord all
[1:49:06] these I don't know how long of a time
[1:49:08] all those years but at that moment here
[1:49:10] everything just moved in and hear what
[1:49:13] came out of that
[1:49:15] a Dwight Moody
[1:49:17] who won
[1:49:19] countless Souls to the Lord as an
[1:49:22] instrument used
[1:49:24] by God
[1:49:27] no doubt there was times that she might
[1:49:29] have Brethren picks it up in Victory Day
[1:49:30] or that day on Calvary she might have
[1:49:32] looked down in her life I'm just a wash
[1:49:33] woman what can I do look at me am I I
[1:49:37] can't even speak writer I can't do this
[1:49:39] right I look we all have our flaws
[1:49:44] all right we all let me just put it this
[1:49:46] way we all have our excuses of why God
[1:49:49] can't use us
[1:49:51] right it'd be like me holding up my iPad
[1:49:53] and show you how many pages that I'm
[1:49:55] staring at you go oh my goodness don't
[1:49:57] worry I Don't Preach out of that many
[1:49:58] pages but you'd look at oh my goodness
[1:50:00] that's sometimes when we get before God
[1:50:01] and we offer him all the excuses of why
[1:50:03] we can't do it but remember it ain't
[1:50:05] your abilities it's doing it
[1:50:07] are you hearing me I'm still here not
[1:50:10] because of my abilities
[1:50:12] you're not here because of your
[1:50:14] abilities
[1:50:15] I'm still here
[1:50:17] because he's not finished
[1:50:22] God bless you brother Liz I'm still here
[1:50:26] because he's not finished
[1:50:28] then I would say like this even here
[1:50:30] here's another day here's another moment
[1:50:32] Lord what would you have me do today
[1:50:35] help me Lord today I would just start
[1:50:37] the day out I would start out like that
[1:50:39] Lord help me today Lord
[1:50:41] if there's things the Lord that I need
[1:50:42] to unpack out of my life weights things
[1:50:45] that's weighing me down things that that
[1:50:47] I've allowed to come in that's weighing
[1:50:49] down my family weighing this down Lord
[1:50:51] help me I don't want these weights that
[1:50:53] start slowing me down
[1:50:55] I want to run this race with patients
[1:50:58] because we are the final
[1:51:01] runners
[1:51:03] you can look behind you there ain't
[1:51:05] nobody else behind you the batons in
[1:51:07] your hand but there's a cloud of many
[1:51:09] witnesses
[1:51:12] and that cloud of many witnesses could
[1:51:14] testify and say
[1:51:15] he did it through me he used me despite
[1:51:19] all of my weaknesses despite all of my
[1:51:21] flaws and my failures he received the
[1:51:24] glory through my life I stand as a
[1:51:28] witness and what is it it's the word in
[1:51:30] this hour where the seals have been
[1:51:32] taken off and there is voices
[1:51:36] yeah of many thunderings that are saying
[1:51:40] you can make it
[1:51:43] keep pressing keep pressing
[1:51:50] I'm still here
[1:51:52] he's not finished
[1:51:54] [Applause]
[1:52:00] Hallelujah
[1:52:02] maybe for him maybe this morning he want
[1:52:04] what he wants to do is he wants to
[1:52:06] finish your life he wants to cap your
[1:52:08] life with the Holy Ghost
[1:52:10] maybe this morning is to bring your life
[1:52:12] into a place of repentance and then
[1:52:15] again it's to encourage our lives that
[1:52:17] to continue and say hey don't allow
[1:52:19] those distractions in your life things
[1:52:22] that he brings up I don't have to call
[1:52:23] him out but he by coming right up next
[1:52:26] to you there's things that you can
[1:52:28] realize this is holding me back this is
[1:52:30] holding me back and it ain't somebody
[1:52:32] else it's me allowing it to hold me back
[1:52:36] because really holding you back is about
[1:52:39] putting a restraint on God and you can
[1:52:41] look at and say don't need this I don't
[1:52:43] want no restraints on Jesus
[1:52:47] let's pray
[1:52:51] Heavenly Father
[1:52:54] Lord Jesus
[1:52:56] I'm still here
[1:52:58] you're not finished Lord
[1:53:01] throughout Lord this building here this
[1:53:04] morning
[1:53:06] God
[1:53:08] even those that would be streaming those
[1:53:10] that Lord would archive it later on I
[1:53:12] believeth on my heart
[1:53:14] Lord Jesus you
[1:53:16] have called and spoke to our hearts
[1:53:19] every one of us we even see a testimony
[1:53:22] stand before us Lord how that you so
[1:53:24] arranged it
[1:53:28] knowing Lord that even in my heart I
[1:53:30] started over here to study on something
[1:53:32] Lord that you had put on my heart just a
[1:53:35] week and a half ago and so forth that's
[1:53:36] been continuing with the thought that
[1:53:39] you moved that Lord that inspiration
[1:53:41] moving
[1:53:42] Lord these moments are pre-planned by
[1:53:46] you
[1:53:47] I'm still here
[1:53:49] you're not finished
[1:53:51] now Lord I pray that God that your mercy
[1:53:55] will move Lord as you have been through
[1:53:57] this service
[1:53:59] God May hearts and lives Lord may we
[1:54:01] lord earnestly reflect upon our life and
[1:54:05] see the purpose Lord what we are here
[1:54:08] for Lord
[1:54:09] God I pray right now if there is a heart
[1:54:12] that does not know you Lord
[1:54:14] Lord maybe they know about you but
[1:54:17] they've never really repented Lord never
[1:54:19] really surrendered their life to you to
[1:54:22] say Lord I am a sinner Lord I need you
[1:54:26] Lord God lord I want you Lord Jesus to
[1:54:29] be my savior Lord Lord I want Lord I
[1:54:33] want that work I want that reality lord
[1:54:35] I can't explain it all but God that
[1:54:37] peace that I sense that that reality
[1:54:39] Lord God that is moved Lord and tugged
[1:54:42] upon my heart that's what I desire Lord
[1:54:44] I want you
[1:54:47] granted Lord may they realize maybe not
[1:54:50] knowing all the times that Lord where
[1:54:52] Satan has
[1:54:54] conspired to take them to a premature
[1:54:56] grave that may they take this
[1:54:58] opportunity because after all that's
[1:55:01] what life is life is an opportunity
[1:55:05] it's an opportunity Lord to serve you
[1:55:09] to serve your purpose we don't know how
[1:55:11] long our Earthly purpose is
[1:55:13] Lord just as on Friday when speaking to
[1:55:16] the young people
[1:55:17] speaking about Garnet Peak Lord where
[1:55:19] the Prophet would take and speak of
[1:55:21] Garnet's life Garnet was an 18 year old
[1:55:23] boy when he passed away
[1:55:25] and to thank Lord God of in his life
[1:55:29] polio had come into his life
[1:55:32] your Prophet was able to tell us it was
[1:55:33] polio that drove him to you
[1:55:36] to where that Lord God he could come to
[1:55:38] that place of what's a real purpose in
[1:55:40] life
[1:55:42] Lord God
[1:55:44] his Earthly Journey was finished
[1:55:47] purpose
[1:55:49] at 18 years old
[1:55:52] but the purpose of God had been served
[1:55:56] and Garnet was awaiting and went on to
[1:55:58] heaven
[1:55:59] Lord Jesus
[1:56:02] may we take Lord God that opportunity
[1:56:04] this morning
[1:56:06] I pray father for our lives Lord there's
[1:56:08] lives no doubt sitting here this morning
[1:56:10] Lord that the desire that you would have
[1:56:12] we're still here
[1:56:14] because you're not finished
[1:56:16] there's a further work Lord a further
[1:56:18] step in our life a further yielding to
[1:56:21] you Lord God
[1:56:22] more than Lord just of repentance but a
[1:56:26] life that Lord God as it you begin to
[1:56:29] move and to clean that life Lord God as
[1:56:31] they begin to yield Lord to your
[1:56:33] presence and
[1:56:34] God you begin to clean that life and to
[1:56:37] the place Lord to where
[1:56:39] that you cap it
[1:56:41] with your presence with your spirit
[1:56:44] to where their life Lord becomes a full
[1:56:46] expression of you
[1:56:49] Lord we'll never be perfect in ourselves
[1:56:51] but it becomes a Perfection of your own
[1:56:54] life working through us
[1:56:56] not what I not not Lord God
[1:56:59] Desiring of things of the flesh but as
[1:57:01] Paul would write where we walk after the
[1:57:03] spirit the desire is to please you Lord
[1:57:05] God
[1:57:07] Lord I pray that you'll help every one
[1:57:08] of us in here Lord
[1:57:10] knowing Lord God that it's Satan's
[1:57:12] objective and desire
[1:57:14] he would love Lord to distract us from
[1:57:16] the purpose that we are here for
[1:57:18] but God we're under the we're under the
[1:57:20] finishing message
[1:57:22] we're under Lord God the finishing
[1:57:24] anointing
[1:57:25] God let it move in our hearts Lord God
[1:57:27] may it move in our lives Lord Jesus
[1:57:30] maybe things have come around that we've
[1:57:32] allowed Lord God to get in the way Lord
[1:57:34] forgive us Lord I pray
[1:57:37] help us Lord God as faithful Runners
[1:57:40] help us Lord that God what you have
[1:57:42] spoke to our hearts we know what the
[1:57:44] weights are
[1:57:45] sin that does so easily be said is Lord
[1:57:47] God let us Lord take under the authority
[1:57:50] of your voice and lay it aside right
[1:57:53] here this morning Lord
[1:57:55] let our hearts be United Lord with you
[1:57:58] Lord with your desire with your will
[1:58:01] God I pray that Lord
[1:58:03] help us to run
[1:58:05] not as distracted people
[1:58:08] but it's people that are running with a
[1:58:10] real Divine attraction in our lives Lord
[1:58:13] may you give strength Lord and courage
[1:58:15] May Lord God his Hearts would look to
[1:58:18] you may you restore
[1:58:20] their Joy Lord as Paul could say I'm
[1:58:23] here to finish my course with joy
[1:58:26] may the Lord God realize they're still
[1:58:29] here I think Lord is what my Aunt Linda
[1:58:31] said right here her request the Lord God
[1:58:33] when she was asking you for her healing
[1:58:35] she said I want to live for my family
[1:58:38] I want to live for them
[1:58:41] Lord God it's her heart's desire
[1:58:44] is to see them Lord God walking Lord in
[1:58:47] the light of this hour
[1:58:49] oh granted Lord God we're still here
[1:58:53] Lord we're not here Lord to make more
[1:58:55] money we're not here Lord to do things
[1:58:58] Lord God that would extend the Earthly
[1:59:01] Kingdom no no no no no no
[1:59:05] I'm still here
[1:59:07] you're not finished
[1:59:09] so Lord our hearts cry out Lord
[1:59:13] what would you have me do
[1:59:15] help me Lord to be
[1:59:17] more surrendered help me Lord
[1:59:20] help me not to be distracted Lord help
[1:59:23] me not to become so busy
[1:59:26] with my life
[1:59:28] that I look
[1:59:29] not upon the things of others
[1:59:34] because that's not what you did
[1:59:37] having cares having needs yet Lord God
[1:59:41] you looked upon the needs of others
[1:59:45] what God is you were bringing to my
[1:59:47] attention even last week and I think as
[1:59:49] I was Lord walking here in the middle of
[1:59:51] this aisle Lord God and praying
[1:59:53] and it struck my heart
[1:59:56] that the things that we do
[1:59:58] it's not about us
[2:00:00] it shouldn't be
[2:00:02] it shouldn't be whether I fell a ship or
[2:00:05] not well I don't need Fellowship but
[2:00:06] maybe my brother needs Fellowship
[2:00:08] maybe my sister needs encouragement It
[2:00:10] Ain't About Me
[2:00:12] it's about
[2:00:14] the body
[2:00:16] because the body
[2:00:18] when Paul came there on the road to
[2:00:21] Damascus you said why do you persecute
[2:00:24] me he's talking about the body
[2:00:26] it was Christ in body form Lord that's
[2:00:29] the same way now help us the Lord this
[2:00:32] flesh the Lord God is so weak we're not
[2:00:34] here to brag it up but it's true Lord
[2:00:36] and forgive us many times Lord God we
[2:00:39] have succumbed to that Lord God instead
[2:00:42] of pressing Beyond it
[2:00:44] this is not an easy walk it's not
[2:00:46] something Lord that comes easy as a
[2:00:48] matter of fact the further we go in time
[2:00:50] the more that we will have to press
[2:00:53] like never before
[2:00:56] press to pray press to read press to be
[2:01:01] in the house of God press to be in
[2:01:04] Fellowship we will have to press harder
[2:01:07] and harder and harder
[2:01:09] help us Lord I pray help us Lord
[2:01:13] God give us Lord may we lord receive
[2:01:16] lord of the strength the right influence
[2:01:18] Lord help us God I pray
[2:01:21] because we're still here
[2:01:24] you're not finished
[2:01:26] Lord maybe I have overlooked a line on
[2:01:28] the script
[2:01:29] maybe there's a part on the play I
[2:01:32] Remember in school sometimes Lord when
[2:01:34] they would tell me what my part is and
[2:01:35] we would read around the classroom and
[2:01:37] I'd try to find all my parts so I did
[2:01:39] not look foolish if I missed it and I
[2:01:42] looked through there and try to pick out
[2:01:43] all my parts in that in that textbook
[2:01:46] but sometimes Lord it'd get to a spot
[2:01:48] and I thought
[2:01:53] they look at
[2:01:57] you realize at that moment
[2:01:59] or that what's happening is that part I
[2:02:02] thought I had all those parts
[2:02:04] and I missed a part
[2:02:07] Lord help us
[2:02:10] help us Lord give us Grace
[2:02:12] for every part Lord
[2:02:15] every line maybe it's not even a line
[2:02:19] maybe it's just an expression
[2:02:22] Lord I'm convinced with all my heart
[2:02:24] it's not so much words
[2:02:27] it's the expression
[2:02:29] of Jesus Christ
[2:02:32] that gets the attention of others Lord
[2:02:35] help us Lord
[2:02:36] May Our Lives
[2:02:39] preach Faithfully
[2:02:41] may it preach Faithfully Jesus Christ
[2:02:45] help us Lord
[2:02:47] and they say Lord help me
[2:02:49] help me Lord help me Jesus
[2:02:55] [Music]

[2:03:10] purpose Lord I'm still here

[2:14:09] [Music]
[2:14:39] new
[2:14:41] [Music]
[2:14:42] that was
[2:14:44] [Music]
[2:14:55] staying some of you may not remember it
[2:14:57] but
[2:14:58] back on Wednesday evening
[2:15:01] I got home and I was laying there and
[2:15:04] I went back and I wanted to see that
[2:15:06] service not the service but I wanted to
[2:15:09] see the service where Ryan had come up
[2:15:12] for prayer when he got on from that
[2:15:13] internship
[2:15:15] and I went back and I started listening
[2:15:17] to that part of it and I clipped it out
[2:15:20] and that's the very song We were singing
[2:15:23] you made a way
[2:15:26] and when as we were closing that song
[2:15:28] out you made a way
[2:15:30] you see him coming right into the
[2:15:32] picture frame
[2:15:33] to stand right here
[2:15:36] brother Brian started singing the song
[2:15:38] he's got it all in control
[2:15:40] I had that song in my heart and I was
[2:15:42] going to tell brother Brian sing this
[2:15:44] song
[2:15:45] you can catch it on video I looked at
[2:15:47] him and I said that's what I had on my
[2:15:49] heart here was brother Ryan standing
[2:15:51] right there in that moment
[2:15:52] asking God
[2:15:54] to help me with this coming semester
[2:15:57] that the Lord would help me
[2:16:00] I wanted to be with me brother Samuel
[2:16:03] and we had prayer and that song God's
[2:16:06] got it all in control
[2:16:09] you know you might be standing here
[2:16:10] today as all of us were maybe there's
[2:16:12] others he's still the Waymaker
[2:16:15] you might wonder in your life this
[2:16:17] morning how could I how could I ever get
[2:16:19] me on this thing or this or that but
[2:16:22] he's a savior he made a way and the
[2:16:25] goodness of God leads you to repentance
[2:16:28] see God Made A Way
[2:16:31] and he dealt with Ryan's heart
[2:16:35] oh I'm so glad about that aren't you
[2:16:37] because it's one thing for God to deal
[2:16:39] with our hearts it's another thing to
[2:16:40] receive it
[2:16:42] but he received
[2:16:44] the way that God had made
[2:16:47] and I think about that how pressing it
[2:16:49] is
[2:16:50] if you're standing here this morning you
[2:16:52] haven't made that decision
[2:16:54] this is a moment to make that decision
[2:16:56] you're still here because he's not
[2:16:59] finished
[2:17:01] he wants to finish he wants his purpose
[2:17:05] to be fulfilled in your life
[2:17:08] and he wants to fulfill it
[2:17:11] I'll tell you he'll do for your life
[2:17:13] what you could not even dream possible
[2:17:20] Satan comes as a thief and Robert to
[2:17:22] kill and to destroy
[2:17:25] but he said I'm come
[2:17:27] that you might have life
[2:17:29] and have it more abundantly
[2:17:33] that's beyond imagination
[2:17:36] what you can even imagine
[2:17:39] glory be to God
[2:17:41] I'm glad he's a Waymaker this morning
[2:17:43] aren't you he's a Waymaker
[2:17:47] oh Hallelujah I know in this in this
[2:17:50] lifetime I know I could speak with
[2:17:51] family I won't be able to pick up my
[2:17:53] phone on the morning say hey how's this
[2:17:54] going
[2:17:55] and I get a text back from him but the
