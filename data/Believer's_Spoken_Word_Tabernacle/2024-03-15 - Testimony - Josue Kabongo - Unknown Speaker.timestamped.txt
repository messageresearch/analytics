[28:51] brother that I don't know really if um
[28:53] anyone here has met him but he and I
[28:55] were together in um uh
[28:58] Mexico there last year in the meetings
[29:01] and then uh he attends brother Ron
[29:04] Peterson's church I had um been with
[29:08] um we had had some fellowship there
[29:12] before uh when we were in Arizona at one
[29:14] time his brother Warren I can't
[29:16] pronounce his last name he's from the
[29:18] Philippines but he's been in uh Arizona
[29:20] for a number of years really good
[29:22] brother but he he had text me uh last
[29:25] week and asked that we'd keep him in
[29:29] prayer he's going to
[29:31] Pakistan um and you know there's two
[29:33] things going on right now there's the
[29:36] holidays for their beliefs Ramadan and
[29:40] then also the approaching of Easter so
[29:44] uh he's going there to be with a
[29:47] Brethren he said his expectations are
[29:49] real high and and brother Warren he's
[29:51] went into some he's went into some tight
[29:54] places already um but the brother Warren
[29:58] has a just a wonderful Ministry and so I
[30:01] know you may not know him but I'm asking
[30:04] that you'd keep him in prayer I I can't
[30:06] pronounce his last name and uh but I
[30:09] know brother Warren and I know he
[30:10] certainly would appreciate that I told
[30:12] him we'll be bringing it before the
[30:13] church and we'll try to bring it up
[30:15] again on Sunday and then next Thursday
[30:17] he's going to be there for a few days
[30:19] and so we just want to be praying for
[30:22] him I also want to ask you to pray for I
[30:25] know I you've been praying for it I I
[30:27] appreciate the request that's been going
[30:29] up for uh the different needs um that
[30:33] have been around that are not even a
[30:34] part of our assembly but they're on our
[30:36] hearts like uh brother Ron Spencer and
[30:39] uh sister Ruth Hoyer and I know there's
[30:41] many others that um are dealing with
[30:45] cancer that we may not even know by name
[30:47] but God knows them and they're just as
[30:49] important as of these other request
[30:52] that's that's made known and we want to
[30:54] just continue to keep each one of them
[30:57] in prayer as well is Brother Bill that
[30:59] the Lord would just completely restore
[31:01] his voice back you know the doctors
[31:03] they've said that that that would be but
[31:07] we are I I told him today when he would
[31:09] came in the office but I was here
[31:10] earlier and left and I said sounding
[31:14] it's coming back but we want to keep our
[31:17] brother in prayer the Lord will just
[31:20] continue to strengthen him and what I've
[31:22] asked for is that God would just so
[31:23] completely restored he'll be able to
[31:25] stand right here and sing again amen
[31:28] I mean to me
[31:30] there's to me there's just nobody can
[31:33] sing hymns like brother Bill and I I
[31:37] really mean that he's got a he's got a
[31:39] real gift with that and um so we just so
[31:43] appreciate that my neighbor Gabe um my
[31:47] wife had a chance to speak with his wife
[31:50] the other day and
[31:53] um uh just asking that you would keep
[31:55] them in prayer i' just been just so that
[31:57] you understand my heart I've I've
[32:00] not I've not intruded I've not tried to
[32:03] knock any doors down or walls down I've
[32:05] continued to let them know I'm here for
[32:07] you we're here for you but I know right
[32:10] now that there's a lot he's 49 years
[32:13] old his name is Gabe
[32:15] Vasquez and uh you know it's a miracle
[32:19] right now that he's still alive they
[32:21] only gave him three to four weeks a
[32:23] couple months ago and so he's coming
[32:25] into his last chemo treatment
[32:28] and um it's a lot a lot of questions
[32:31] they have on their on their heart my
[32:33] wife was expressing that as far as with
[32:36] from his wife and I know she's wanted me
[32:40] to talk to him but she's wanted the door
[32:42] to open his wife has and you know I just
[32:45] I've just been praying about I'm asking
[32:47] you to help me
[32:52] pray I know he told me before he said
[32:54] Sam he said with the first go around he
[32:56] said it said it brought me closer to the
[32:59] Lord but you know he's in a place right
[33:02] now that a lot of questions of why you
[33:05] know where sometimes where a person can
[33:07] be almost a little
[33:10] bitter but I'm asking you to just keep
[33:12] him in
[33:14] prayer I've a lot of things I have on my
[33:17] heart and things but I'm just looking
[33:18] I'm waiting I'm looking to the Lord and
[33:21] I just want to be mindful of his leading
[33:23] I've got some things I don't want to say
[33:25] it out right now I want to keep it close
[33:27] to my heart heart but would you just
[33:29] continue to keep that in prayer I know
[33:31] you have been but
[33:35] just just want to see the Lord move for
[33:37] him whatever whatever the way I I want
[33:41] everything to be ready there and love to
[33:44] see nothing more than the Lord just
[33:47] completely
[33:48] restoring that's what it really is I'm
[33:50] just praying
[33:52] for but
[33:54] um tonight if we could just stand
[33:56] together and
[33:58] I certainly appreciate the musicians and
[34:00] before I ask brother joshu he's I know
[34:03] he's got some on this presentation but I
[34:06] just want to read one verse of scripture
[34:10] as our brother would prepare to come and
[34:14] I've asked brother joshu to share his
[34:16] testimony tonight we he was going to try
[34:19] to share it in one time that we had
[34:22] together with a testimony service but it
[34:25] just didn't work out for him to be here
[34:26] and as a matter of fact
[34:29] fact um it needed some more time and
[34:33] I've heard I've heard bits and pieces of
[34:36] his testimony but there's things that I
[34:38] had not
[34:39] heard until we were setting back in
[34:42] January 1st at sister Judith's
[34:46] house and
[34:48] um that right there was something I
[34:51] looked at and I said this we we it needs
[34:53] to be shared every every testimony is
[34:56] important but I want you to look at this
[34:59] tonight as we turn to Psalms 139 thank
[35:03] you
[35:04] musicians Psalms 139 and then I'm going
[35:07] to just we just turn it right over to

[35:25] uh you can come on up here

[35:35] prolonging uh anything right here uh

[36:14] substance yet being unperfect in other
[36:17] words had not been completely come into
[36:19] form and manifestation and in thy book

[38:53] why don't you turn around and shake
[38:54] hands with
[38:56] someone
[39:26] the
[39:45] okay God bless
[39:47] you
[39:48] um before I start I just want to
[39:56] uh
[39:58] langage I might lose the process of
[40:02] thought through what I'm going to say
[40:04] throughout this testimony so um just
[40:08] understand that and uh other thing is
[40:10] that I'm not good a public
[40:13] speaker uh if I mispronounce something
[40:17] uh please bear with me um as Brother Sam
[40:22] uh Samuel said uh last year I had this
[40:25] burden in my heart to share what God has
[40:29] done in my life but
[40:32] um uh it's been years actually God doing
[40:36] something I'll be like oh God if you do
[40:38] this I'll testify if you do this for me
[40:42] I'll testify but all this thing
[40:45] accumulated that I forgot I didn't have
[40:48] enough time but since last year when we
[40:51] were going through the immigration
[40:54] process for my wife um that's when I
[40:57] start heing uh feeling this burden to
[41:00] share all that God has been doing um so
[41:05] it's going to be very lengthy also bear
[41:08] with me on that I just want to bring in
[41:12] some more details that this can help
[41:15] somebody who might be going to the same
[41:18] thing
[41:21] um so the uh testimony I'm going to give
[41:24] tonight is going to have two parts
[41:27] one is uh about all everything you guys
[41:33] know about my wife what God did last
[41:36] year so that's what I want to start with
[41:39] because it's a little shorter than the
[41:42] whole testimony so uh that's why you
[41:46] want to uh call Sharon to come here and
[41:50] uh so I can uh glorify God and then uh
[41:57] uh together with you people of God
[41:59] because you prayed it's also the answer
[42:01] to your
[42:09] prayers so uh in
[42:13] 2001 that's uh when uh after school and
[42:17] starting working that's when I start
[42:19] looking for uh somebody to get married
[42:22] to so I went around uh according to what
[42:26] I thought was normal to do uh and uh
[42:31] through the leading of Brother Sam but
[42:35] after few
[42:38] trips uh that were not successful so I
[42:41] start having this burden uh to uh go
[42:46] back uh home in Congo to get married
[42:49] there but I resist that I didn't I
[42:52] didn't like that at all because I knew
[42:56] the and out of immigration system and
[43:00] I've been through that before I didn't
[43:01] want to go through that again and it's
[43:04] uh more expensive and somebody abroad we
[43:08] don't know who they are what's going on
[43:10] so I resist that for a long time but uh
[43:15] as the burden was growing so I pray that
[43:18] God if this time I'm I'm making this
[43:21] trip uh somewhere else I was going I
[43:24] believe in Kentucky if things don't go
[43:28] the way I think should go then I will
[43:31] know that it's a sign from you that I
[43:33] have to go back to Africa so I went uh
[43:38] uh with uh one of the brothers uh who
[43:41] prays in uh um Lima we made a trip to
[43:48] Kentucky
[43:50] um uh on our way back that's when I
[43:54] realized that uh maybe
[43:57] this time you might be the best but
[44:01] after a few
[44:03] weeks uh that's when the person I was
[44:07] interested in uh said that uh he was not
[44:11] going to work so I was like either way
[44:15] it's God's will because it's the prayer
[44:18] that is being answered also so that's
[44:22] when I start uh talking to Sharon uh in
[44:27] Congo Sharon is a daughter of my former
[44:33] Pastor when I used to be there uh she
[44:36] was younger when I
[44:38] left uh but uh when I start thinking
[44:43] about who am I going to talk in Congo
[44:45] and all that I spoke with her dad so uh
[44:50] she was also finishing her high school
[44:53] and
[44:54] everything that's how we start talking
[44:57] of Sharon
[44:59] but we didn't know how things were going
[45:01] to end uh because I did some research uh
[45:07] about the immigration process how things
[45:10] uh work with fiance or marriage things
[45:14] like that so the information that was
[45:18] there at the time was that within a year
[45:22] somebody who fiance can bring uh who is
[45:24] fiance to a foreign uh uh person can
[45:29] bring them back in the
[45:31] US so that's how I decided that we can
[45:34] go ahead and uh bring her up here as a
[45:37] fiance so we can get married in the
[45:40] church here but um things didn't turn
[45:44] out as we expected because the pandemic
[45:49] the covid pandemic didn't do Accord to
[45:52] us uh there was like a big backlog of uh
[45:56] cases at the the uh immigration uh
[45:59] offices that to treat the cases that
[46:03] were being introduced it was taking so
[46:06] long because they were treating the
[46:08] cases that were there before so that's
[46:11] uh how we cut uh delayed so long so we
[46:17] just kept praying that uh God would make
[46:19] a way so that they can tweat our case
[46:23] give us the answer so I think everybody
[46:27] in this church prayed for that also uh
[46:31] until uh God answered but you know
[46:36] sometimes uh God want to see how patient
[46:40] we are but uh you most of the time we
[46:44] fall short on that uh because we are
[46:47] human
[46:48] but
[46:50] uh I decide that before it's taking too
[46:53] long so I'm going back to Congo just get
[46:57] married and uh come back and wait uh
[47:01] until the immigration answers the
[47:04] request so I went there in uh February
[47:08] of uh
[47:10] 2022 uh I believe yeah that's where when
[47:14] we get we got married in Congo um in the
[47:18] church there so even though I had wished
[47:21] to have the uh wedding ceremony here so
[47:25] it was against my wish but God knew
[47:29] everything uh I went there we got
[47:33] married so I spent one month there uh
[47:37] the in March I came back the same day I
[47:39] cut here that's when I got the uh email
[47:43] from the immigration that they answered
[47:47] the request uh positively so now uh
[47:53] after that there was another process to
[47:55] go through the case to be sent to the um
[47:59] National visa
[48:00] center uh where the case number will be
[48:03] assigned before it sent to the Embassy
[48:06] in Congo where Sharon is or was and uh
[48:12] it took also like almost three months to
[48:16] get the cas to the um National visa
[48:20] center and we were hope that that summer
[48:23] she would come here after the case
[48:26] reached the
[48:28] Embassy to our big surprise when the
[48:31] case reached the
[48:33] embassy uh we couldn't get the
[48:35] appointment we they told us that there
[48:39] is no uh like open space for appointment
[48:44] for
[48:46] interview at this time we were like
[48:48] desperate because uh they were given the
[48:52] same reason that the covid uh made the
[48:56] thing more iated and for that specific
[48:59] uh counil in Congo they had stopped
[49:03] tweeting cases of uh fiance
[49:07] visa so we were like there was no uh
[49:12] hope that anything would come out there
[49:16] because they
[49:17] said the only possible availability for
[49:22] interview would be in
[49:24] 2025 so we we were all shocked and
[49:30] uh despair settling and all that but
[49:34] again we turn to the prayers here every
[49:37] Thursday every Sunday here everybody was
[49:40] praying and uh from the bottom of our
[49:42] heart we say thank you again and uh we
[49:46] know that God answers prayer that's uh
[49:51] uh what happened that after uh three
[49:56] three month from June to September we
[50:00] didn't hear nothing and uh we prayed we
[50:03] prayed until in June uh in September we
[50:07] got a opening that they would answer
[50:12] they will give us the interview in in
[50:17] November this was like a big surprise
[50:21] because uh I did also research uh in the
[50:25] at the council us Council in Congo uh
[50:29] even with people who did the student
[50:33] visa to come here to study it was the
[50:35] same answer the availability would be
[50:38] until
[50:39] 2025 so we were like there was no hope
[50:43] ins sight but God made a way
[50:47] that uh through his power he opened the
[50:51] Kate for us so that she can have the
[50:54] interview she did it she cut the
[50:57] interview done I was there and uh uh
[51:01] they granted her visa to come here and
[51:04] we cut here so since then I've been
[51:07] trying to uh testify of what God did but
[51:11] I didn't have time uh last time I was
[51:14] going to do it during the testimony
[51:16] session here but I got uh booked at work
[51:21] and I was not able to so this is to say
[51:24] that um there is no need to be in a
[51:28] despair because we have a God that can
[51:32] do what men cannot do so we want to uh
[51:38] give glory to God because he's worthy of
[51:41] it so thank you so much again God bless
[51:45] you for praying for my wife so you can
[51:48] go back I wish she could speak English
[51:50] would talk by herself
[51:55] but
[51:58] yeah
[52:00] so all is just uh one of the path uh of
[52:08] B uh a everything that God has been
[52:12] doing in my life and this was like the
[52:15] last episode if it was a series it would
[52:18] be like episode one two
[52:21] three
[52:23] so yeah so from uh the beginning uh that
[52:29] I made this slide so that he can uh help
[52:33] us because I can lost the idea of what
[52:36] I'm trying to do so
[52:41] uh so I just want to read uh we can read
[52:45] together uh so um that's Psalms 22
[52:51] 2225 I will declare thy name onto my
[52:55] brethren in the midst of the
[52:57] congregation will I praise thee he that
[53:00] fear the Lord praise him all ye the seed
[53:04] of Jacob glorify him and fear Him all ye
[53:09] the seed of Israel for he hasn't
[53:13] despised or AB the Affliction of The
[53:17] Afflicted neither has he hid his face
[53:21] from him but when he Cried unto him he
[53:25] heard my my praise shall be of the in
[53:29] the great congregation I will pay my
[53:32] vows before that fear them that fear the
[53:36] lord that fear
[53:39] Him this uh scripture is uh what um
[53:47] inspired me to share it's uh because uh
[53:53] we we are human we have more tendencies
[53:56] to be
[53:57] ungrateful uh but uh God calls us to the
[54:02] opposite side of that to be grateful and
[54:05] if God does something uh we need to make
[54:10] it known to others not only to let them
[54:14] know that we are special no it's because
[54:17] to let them know that there is a God
[54:19] that is able to do uh things that are
[54:23] Beyond us so um
[54:27] going back to my uh
[54:30] uh uh Early Childhood that's where I
[54:33] want to start just to set the uh the
[54:36] step footstep of uh how thing unfold
[54:40] afterward is that uh I didn't have a
[54:44] very uh good
[54:47] uh or happy childhood because from the
[54:51] beginning it's been uh all
[54:55] always uh series of hardship poverty uh
[55:01] suffering uh uh a lot of things that I
[55:06] canot give details of everything but um
[55:11] as you can see that from early on I
[55:14] didn't grow up for my parents uh my dad
[55:19] I didn't see him at all so I just heard
[55:21] that he passed away I was baby or
[55:24] something like that uh and uh my mom um
[55:29] she didn't have a stable place to stay
[55:32] also so I was staying with my
[55:35] grandparents uh I didn't see her much
[55:39] neither so because she was uh
[55:43] elsewhere but at age 8 around 8 she
[55:47] start getting sick and sicker also and
[55:51] uh so forth around age nine she went on
[55:55] and passed away so I stayed with my
[55:59] grandparent I saw her uh dying so
[56:04] nothing that could be done no uh money
[56:08] to give her like good health care and
[56:12] all that she also had a baby which uh
[56:16] was uh around 2 years old or 3 years old
[56:21] and uh because when she passed on the
[56:24] baby you know when a baby lose the mom
[56:28] they they sometimes they can't handle it
[56:31] well uh she start getting sick also
[56:36] and
[56:37] uh we didn't have money my grand parents
[56:41] didn't have money to uh bring her to
[56:43] hospital either so uh she suffered I was
[56:47] watching and looking as she was dying
[56:50] slowly and uh she went on and died uh
[56:57] we couldn't even afford the cemetery so
[57:00] they had to bury her behind the house uh
[57:04] so that's uh from then I was
[57:09] very
[57:11] uh uh in
[57:13] hopelessness I was becoming very
[57:17] isolated I didn't want to do anything
[57:19] with anybody you want to share anything
[57:22] I was just kept to myself uh very inter
[57:26] so uh I very very introvert so it was
[57:33] not because I didn't have something to
[57:35] share but it was just because it was too
[57:37] much so I couldn't uh um
[57:41] so that's when my grandparent decided to
[57:45] uh leave the big city where they lived
[57:47] went to the village and uh together with
[57:50] me they took me there uh they did that
[57:53] the field work farm work
[57:57] uh to meet their needs at the same time
[58:02] um I start going to school in this
[58:05] Village uh so I do the field work of
[58:10] them and pay my school because in Congo
[58:12] we are not so privileged to study for
[58:15] free you have to walk uh pay the the
[58:19] school for yourself if you don't pay so
[58:22] the government doesn't care so I did
[58:25] this few filled uh work and paid uh my
[58:28] school as the time went
[58:31] on and that's when I uh found out that
[58:37] um the way to escape this feeling of
[58:42] hopelessness and uh the isol isolation
[58:45] and everything so I really fell in love
[58:48] with school in a way that I could miss
[58:52] everything but not school because that's
[58:53] where I was in company of other student
[58:56] and uh so I really liked school a lot it
[59:01] was one of the mechanism to uh num the
[59:05] the hurt I had and uh also my
[59:08] grandparents were Pentecostal believers
[59:13] they prayed in Pentecostal church so uh
[59:17] I went to church with them and uh I
[59:20] really to escape again beside the school
[59:24] I'm not sure if this is fine um yeah uh
[59:29] so I really became also more involved in
[59:33] uh that church or Pentecostal church
[59:36] because they had a lot of praying a
[59:38] session of fasting and praying or that
[59:42] so it was an an opportunity for me to
[59:44] express what I was feeling in me in
[59:46] prayer so I was praying a lot and um
[59:51] staying a lot in uh in the church um
[59:56] because just to escape all this uh thing
[59:59] going but uh it didn't uh help a lot but
[1:00:04] he did for the
[1:00:07] time
[1:00:09] uh a certain point there was
[1:00:15] a uh campaign Evangelical Evangelical
[1:00:19] campaign where people came uh in the SE
[1:00:23] in the village with uh
[1:00:27] a big organization organizing a
[1:00:29] preaching session so we didn't know who
[1:00:32] they were so we turn out that it was
[1:00:35] message uh Believers from the big city
[1:00:39] that came in this The Village to do the
[1:00:42] campaign to bring in uh new
[1:00:46] Believers so at this time my
[1:00:50] grandparents were were the one who
[1:00:52] attended that Campa campaign at jco uh
[1:00:57] because believe it or not there was a
[1:01:00] big reputation in Congo that those who
[1:01:03] believe the message where um I'm not
[1:01:07] sure how you say it in English people
[1:01:09] who worship aen uh idolatry something
[1:01:13] like that so a big stigma if you believe
[1:01:17] the message they look up ah he worships
[1:01:20] a men uh and uh there was so many
[1:01:25] Catholic Church
[1:01:26] um also Pentecostal church around so
[1:01:30] nobody had much to do with the message
[1:01:33] churches but uh it turns out that it was
[1:01:37] because people didn't know actually the
[1:01:40] content or content of the message they
[1:01:45] just heard uh they didn't know what is
[1:01:47] inside the message actually that's uh
[1:01:51] why people held this belief but after
[1:01:54] this campaign and uh the preacher that
[1:01:57] was there uh was uh had the gift of
[1:02:00] healing so people saw really that God
[1:02:03] can walk mightly uh like right now
[1:02:08] because we used to you know go to church
[1:02:11] pray fast and do all these things but
[1:02:15] seeing God working uh like in real time
[1:02:20] was like strange to people but when they
[1:02:23] saw that people start believe in the
[1:02:27] message so uh my grandparent along them
[1:02:31] they believe the message I was still in
[1:02:35] a Pentecostal church so because I didn't
[1:02:39] want to
[1:02:40] be uh uh labored as a man
[1:02:45] worshipper
[1:02:47] so uh but from time to times
[1:02:50] because
[1:02:52] uh
[1:02:53] uh what we call children rights how you
[1:02:57] call child rights or you know the right
[1:03:00] of children uh it's not
[1:03:03] as exalted in cono as it is in here so
[1:03:07] sometimes they will be like you go to
[1:03:09] church today with us or you don't
[1:03:11] eat okay
[1:03:13] so I have them to go uh with them
[1:03:18] so uh from the time to time when I got
[1:03:22] there uh they preach uh it was like a
[1:03:25] Sunday
[1:03:27] school I feel like the teaching was
[1:03:30] pretty good but the the prayer part
[1:03:36] because I was so attached to the
[1:03:37] Pentecostal church I didn't feel the
[1:03:40] prayer the the warmth of praying like
[1:03:43] the way I was in the Pentecostal church
[1:03:46] because we didn't have time it was like
[1:03:48] uh Sunday school so no time for that it
[1:03:51] was just teaching and letting you go uh
[1:03:55] but then time the teaching took over my
[1:03:59] uh uh assumptions my uh belief like this
[1:04:05] is pretty actually good so comparing to
[1:04:08] what we're doing in Pentecostal church
[1:04:10] and this St teaching so I become pretty
[1:04:15] much uh
[1:04:17] convinced but I was not concerned I was
[1:04:20] like ah it's good but
[1:04:24] uh uh then then at the same time years
[1:04:28] went on like two years until when I got
[1:04:31] almost in uh High School one year before
[1:04:34] high school uh that's when I became con
[1:04:38] convinced that this is the best is the
[1:04:41] truth so there is no way that I can be
[1:04:45] uh foot in foot out so I need to uh
[1:04:49] become uh involved so uh at the time I
[1:04:55] got also High School
[1:04:58] uh and this high school I went on was
[1:05:03] a Catholic church
[1:05:06] school so in a Catholic Church you have
[1:05:10] to attend the mass uh or you you're not
[1:05:15] part of the school so and at the same
[1:05:19] time I became very involved in message
[1:05:22] the message and that's when I get in
[1:05:25] this school
[1:05:26] where they forc me to go to the Catholic
[1:05:29] church every Thursday and every uh
[1:05:32] Sunday Thursday morning because they had
[1:05:35] the mass before school you go to the
[1:05:36] mass and you go to the school meeting
[1:05:39] and then you go to the class if you
[1:05:42] don't attend this mass at the morning
[1:05:46] meeting at the like school assembly
[1:05:50] they'll call you up front and they'll
[1:05:52] beat you until you
[1:05:54] bleed and uh
[1:05:56] so that's uh how it was and this
[1:06:01] happened I couldn't uh do that because I
[1:06:05] knew what the Catholicism was and what
[1:06:10] the message says about it so when I go
[1:06:13] to school I don't attend the mess I get
[1:06:16] beaten every week I'm like so this is
[1:06:19] becoming too much it's either I stick
[1:06:22] with this or I give it up and uh but if
[1:06:27] I give it up where else I could get a
[1:06:29] good education because it was the best
[1:06:32] school in the city the town uh that had
[1:06:35] good reputation uh uh and this was uh
[1:06:39] what you call here equivalent of 11th
[1:06:42] grade at the beginning that's when it
[1:06:44] became more severe so uh one day I got
[1:06:49] beaten so I made up my mind that morning
[1:06:52] that uh this is it so I'm not going to
[1:06:57] uh come to the school again uh I had to
[1:07:00] quit and go to a public
[1:07:03] school uh a public school which didn't
[1:07:06] have a good reputation compared to uh
[1:07:10] Catholic school so uh when I got there
[1:07:14] um many people knew me because I had
[1:07:18] also relatively good reputation in the
[1:07:21] school because of uh good grades and
[1:07:23] every that uh people were disappointed
[1:07:27] to see that I was leaving but I didn't
[1:07:29] have Choice um some of two other brother
[1:07:34] two other person that really trust me
[1:07:38] decide to live at the same time with me
[1:07:40] for some
[1:07:41] reason so I uh went to this school the
[1:07:46] following year which was like the year
[1:07:50] of graduation from high school in Congo
[1:07:53] we have the system of national
[1:07:55] examination uh naal which means uh the
[1:07:59] in 12th grade they send this exam at the
[1:08:02] end of the year you do it so they sent
[1:08:06] the uh examination to the capital
[1:08:10] somewhere where they uh give the uh
[1:08:15] correction and then they publish who has
[1:08:18] uh succeeded or who has failed the year
[1:08:22] then they have to restart again so at
[1:08:25] this time I didn't have a mean to repeat
[1:08:29] any class because I didn't have money I
[1:08:32] didn't have a I had to succeed and
[1:08:35] finish because if I don't finish uh I
[1:08:39] not be able to afford the next year to
[1:08:41] repeat the
[1:08:43] year but when I left went to this uh
[1:08:46] other school uh and we did the final
[1:08:50] exam the national
[1:08:52] exam so my generation from the Catholic
[1:08:57] church that was in 12 gr that Year
[1:09:01] everybody failed except one person who
[1:09:03] was not as bright as we
[1:09:06] thought and uh but where where I went
[1:09:10] which was didn't have good reputation so
[1:09:13] uh we passed almost at 85 87% of person
[1:09:19] I'm like wow so that's why I was
[1:09:23] thinking for the scriptures says
[1:09:26] whosoever believes on him shall not be
[1:09:29] ashamed
[1:09:31] so it was that if I didn't believe in
[1:09:35] God H to stand by what was right to
[1:09:38] leave this school I was going to fail
[1:09:41] together with this generation and uh
[1:09:45] then but God didn't leave me he made a
[1:09:48] way that uh I was able to
[1:09:53] succeed so
[1:09:57] that's a small detail of my uh childhood
[1:10:01] growing up until things went South uh
[1:10:07] that's uh What uh will lead us to how I
[1:10:12] get to United States because even
[1:10:15] growing up I had ambition you know you
[1:10:18] were in a village you studying you feel
[1:10:20] like you are people think you are smart
[1:10:23] but there is no way you can get ahead
[1:10:26] because in K it's not how smart you are
[1:10:29] it's who you know or how much money you
[1:10:32] have to succeed in life uh but here I
[1:10:36] was in Village but I had ambition in me
[1:10:40] I I want to become this I want this this
[1:10:43] but there is no way to get to that uh
[1:10:46] but uh God knew everything from the
[1:10:50] beginning so uh that's uh
[1:10:56] After High School though I stayed in the
[1:10:58] village uh one of my uncles who had some
[1:11:01] business in the city called me to walk
[1:11:04] with him but I knew that he's not
[1:11:08] believer and his wife was uh even more
[1:11:12] not believer uh they could have a bad
[1:11:15] influence on me I may not uh progress
[1:11:19] well so I refused I stayed in the
[1:11:21] village doing field
[1:11:23] walk uh given that I was close to the
[1:11:27] church where I was uh praying uh and I
[1:11:30] was also helping the pastor of that
[1:11:33] church um like a treasure uh keeping the
[1:11:38] church finance and things like that yeah
[1:11:40] I was helping that way and also teaching
[1:11:43] Sunday School uh
[1:11:46] so until two years later uh I start now
[1:11:52] uh leaving the village going selling
[1:11:55] stuff stuff
[1:11:56] around
[1:11:58] uh and it led me to go uh to
[1:12:03] this uh place I'm going to show you now
[1:12:06] so this is how it all
[1:12:09] started uh we I left the village now I'm
[1:12:13] around the country Selling Stuff buying
[1:12:16] stuff and everything so uh originally uh
[1:12:21] on this map this is in Congo this is
[1:12:24] where I'm from
[1:12:25] right there where uh the light is that's
[1:12:29] my Province so it's 26 province in total
[1:12:33] so I'm from here but as I was doing
[1:12:36] these things uh I found myself up here
[1:12:41] you can see the distance so I was there
[1:12:45] uh selling things uh because when I left
[1:12:50] here first I went to the capital city
[1:12:53] kinasa where I bought Stu and went
[1:12:56] through the this is Congo
[1:12:58] River this is the Congo River so I went
[1:13:02] through this River to this part of the
[1:13:05] Congo where I sold things and bought all
[1:13:08] the stuff were going back to kinasa
[1:13:12] still on the Congo
[1:13:13] River
[1:13:16] so uh you can do your Google search you
[1:13:19] find out that Congo River is a second in
[1:13:22] the world or something like that
[1:13:24] powerful long and very can be also very
[1:13:28] dangerous um
[1:13:32] so uh on this was on October 28th in
[1:13:38] 2009 that's when this uh event happened
[1:13:43] so I uh was in
[1:13:46] this uh on this River in something
[1:13:50] called a barge I'm not sure if you know
[1:13:52] the barge it's uh a big metallic case
[1:13:57] pushed by a marine engine
[1:14:01] so we had our Goods in this barge and uh
[1:14:07] selling back to
[1:14:09] kinasa but it happened that uh we were
[1:14:15] in the wrong place at the wrong moment
[1:14:19] how so we came with the budge somewhere
[1:14:24] here from here from here we came from on
[1:14:28] the river to somewhere here that's where
[1:14:32] they accosted I believe that's how you
[1:14:35] say it they accosted the barge to change
[1:14:38] the engine or to maintain the engine and
[1:14:41] everything uh so we have to spend the
[1:14:44] night on this
[1:14:46] place um without us knowing that at the
[1:14:51] village where we had we had were both uh
[1:14:57] accosted there was like a tribal
[1:15:02] conflict going on the
[1:15:03] village uh it was a inter Community uh
[1:15:07] fighting going on it's been boiling on
[1:15:10] for a long time but this day was
[1:15:13] actually the fiful day or uh Dreadful
[1:15:17] day
[1:15:20] so that's when we slept there it was a
[1:15:23] Wednesday night so now on Thursday
[1:15:27] morning that's when the fightings broke
[1:15:30] out in these two Villages so one of the
[1:15:34] Village People came to this village
[1:15:36] where our boat was and uh start fighting
[1:15:40] so they killed almost everybody or the
[1:15:45] majority of the Village
[1:15:48] um they killed a lot of people and came
[1:15:51] back when they finish in the village
[1:15:53] they took over so now they came to the
[1:15:55] river which is like their po or where
[1:15:59] the people come with goods and all uh
[1:16:04] put their goods in the ships to ship
[1:16:06] them away yeah yeah Port so they came
[1:16:12] now to the port and our B was are casted
[1:16:17] and we are it's like on a river so you
[1:16:19] don't know where to go it's uh if this
[1:16:22] side is water and this is the village
[1:16:24] where they killing people so you stuck
[1:16:27] there there's nowhere to go that's how
[1:16:30] we stayed
[1:16:32] there uh as they came they were shooting
[1:16:36] everybody who was moving anything that
[1:16:39] moves they shoot they kill um so they
[1:16:43] came they approached us it was around
[1:16:45] 9:00 a.m. in the morning so they start
[1:16:48] shooting from AAR
[1:16:51] so uh the only place to hide was like
[1:16:54] the stack of corns in uh in uh what you
[1:16:59] call uh in bags and there's corn in bags
[1:17:04] and uh Cava and other goods St stacked
[1:17:08] up in on the BGE so you can hide under
[1:17:11] each one of these things uh but I head
[1:17:15] somewhere I sat down like and the pile
[1:17:19] of cones and my knees to my chest just
[1:17:23] not to be seen
[1:17:26] so unfortunately I saw them coming and
[1:17:30] uh this one person had a rifle and he
[1:17:35] went down in one knees
[1:17:37] and and he shoot so I didn't know if he
[1:17:42] he pointed at me I saw he pointed at me
[1:17:44] but I didn't know uh I didn't hear the
[1:17:47] pain or anything so that's when I see
[1:17:51] one of my leg falling down I'm like
[1:17:56] I'm sitting down but my leg is falling
[1:17:58] down what's happening I look like this
[1:18:01] it was um
[1:18:03] blood going all over and my leg was
[1:18:06] laying down I couldn't I'm like
[1:18:09] o now um I got shot so uh as I'm trying
[1:18:15] to because I didn't even feel pain at
[1:18:17] first so uh when I try now to scream or
[1:18:22] cry after I felt the pain that's when I
[1:18:25] realized that I had a lot of bones in my
[1:18:27] mouth like bones in mouth what happened
[1:18:31] again so I had reflex to touch my head
[1:18:34] just to make sure that my uh uh skull
[1:18:38] was not uh blown up but my head was
[1:18:42] intact so I touch my mouth that's when I
[1:18:46] heard my lip laying on my uh uh Shen
[1:18:50] here so turns out that the bone I heard
[1:18:55] in I felt in my mouth was like my teeth
[1:18:59] that c blown out by a
[1:19:03] bullet so I was here uh uh I'm like this
[1:19:09] is it so it's over
[1:19:15] uh but
[1:19:17] uh uh there was nothing I could do at
[1:19:20] this time other than cry to God I really
[1:19:24] cried at that time because uh the what
[1:19:27] they were doing that was that when they
[1:19:30] shoot people people fall down and they
[1:19:33] will come uh if you you didn't die they
[1:19:36] will cut the uh the throat so they can
[1:19:40] finish you so when they came almost
[1:19:45] about to come over the
[1:19:49] barge uh God
[1:19:51] intervened
[1:19:53] so God
[1:19:55] J that there was one of their member of
[1:20:00] the army or their Rebel group came from
[1:20:03] the village running and yelling very
[1:20:07] high and
[1:20:08] screaming uh they because they had a
[1:20:10] chief somebody in higher rank who were
[1:20:13] like leading the battle here there and
[1:20:16] he came yelling that uh the chief says
[1:20:19] to stop stop stop killing and preserve
[1:20:23] the ammunition
[1:20:27] wow they were like because this is the
[1:20:30] buge and they were like at the door of
[1:20:32] this church coming in that's when this
[1:20:35] men came in yelling and
[1:20:38] screaming so uh for some reason they
[1:20:42] stopped uh carrying people throat that
[1:20:45] were because they had machetes and
[1:20:47] knives and the
[1:20:49] rifles um they stopped and they now
[1:20:54] start just collecting people valuables
[1:20:57] uh like uh if you have money they come
[1:21:00] they take it they take everything and
[1:21:03] uh so when uh they reached the barge
[1:21:08] where I
[1:21:09] was uh there was like so many people
[1:21:12] other other people that were also shot
[1:21:14] dead the one that were living that were
[1:21:17] still alive on that b were like uh five
[1:21:21] that were shot with me but the rest were
[1:21:24] dead like that were shot
[1:21:27] also uh the one that were left alive
[1:21:32] were some of the people from The Village
[1:21:35] Who had who knew each other with these
[1:21:37] people prior to this
[1:21:39] conflict
[1:21:42] so uh this was like uh almost after
[1:21:48] 12 we start they they shed me around 9
[1:21:52] so at 12: after they were they still
[1:21:55] collecting things taking every uh money
[1:21:58] everything they had to take so and the
[1:22:01] time went
[1:22:02] on now they didn't know what to do with
[1:22:05] me
[1:22:06] because uh this is not the first time I
[1:22:09] have an accent because at that in that
[1:22:11] region I had an accent because I was not
[1:22:14] from that region for so it's where am I
[1:22:20] uh so it's uh from here to there so they
[1:22:25] speak so many different dialects and and
[1:22:29] when I speak I have a big accent so
[1:22:32] nobody doesn't recognize me from their
[1:22:34] region like so where is he from so some
[1:22:39] they start speculating about where I'm
[1:22:42] from and uh so that was one of I believe
[1:22:47] maybe one of the reason they didn't
[1:22:49] finish me because they identified me as
[1:22:52] not a threat to them
[1:22:57] so um as they start now trying what to
[1:23:01] do with me um a small uh canoe came
[1:23:05] around a for those who don't know
[1:23:09] African Cano it's like this uh but it
[1:23:14] was much smaller uh but in this Cano
[1:23:18] they had to transport two uh two people
[1:23:24] let's see
[1:23:24] three people it was one person who used
[1:23:28] to walk on that Port of uh entry uh to
[1:23:33] the Village from a he used to be a uh
[1:23:37] government agent so he had also a good
[1:23:41] reputation so they want to save him
[1:23:43] because he was shot also and he survived
[1:23:46] he was shot in the right arm uh he
[1:23:50] survived he survived and they want to
[1:23:53] save him
[1:23:55] uh now they like and one of other person
[1:23:59] whom they knew also they want to save
[1:24:02] this two people but uh that's when they
[1:24:05] cut this canoe to C them across the the
[1:24:09] river because the village was bound down
[1:24:11] so there was no way to take care of them
[1:24:15] but the only way to save them was to go
[1:24:18] across the river right here this is the
[1:24:23] Congo RC where I'm from and this is in
[1:24:27] green is another Congo a smaller Congo
[1:24:32] uh it's another country but it is
[1:24:34] separated by Congo
[1:24:37] River right there so this all events are
[1:24:41] happening here so we have to cross the
[1:24:44] River from there to here uh in hopes to
[1:24:49] find uh medical care but uh that that's
[1:24:55] when they put these two people in the
[1:24:57] canoe and they about to leave so when
[1:25:01] they about to leave that's when I start
[1:25:02] screaming more I'm like if I stay here
[1:25:06] so I'm done um so I screamed even more
[1:25:12] they like they didn't know what to do
[1:25:13] with me because they did stop killing
[1:25:16] people so it's like okay the only way
[1:25:19] what we can do for him is to put him
[1:25:21] with these people and uh cross the
[1:25:25] uh the
[1:25:26] river that
[1:25:30] uh when they decided uh to put me in the
[1:25:35] same boat with these people and
[1:25:39] uh to send me across the river of these
[1:25:43] people uh to get the um first aid that's
[1:25:48] when I think that Psalms 234 to5 says
[1:25:54] yay though I walk through the valley of
[1:25:56] the shadow of death I will fear no evil
[1:26:00] for thou art with me thy Road and thy
[1:26:03] staff they comfort me thou prepare a
[1:26:08] table before me in the presence of my
[1:26:12] enemies because they were the one who
[1:26:15] were meant to finish me but they were
[1:26:18] the one who helped me to go across and
[1:26:23] got saved
[1:26:25] so that scripture came alive right
[1:26:30] there so uh when I got uh to get uh on
[1:26:36] this canoe it was because the weight was
[1:26:39] too much five people in this canoe was
[1:26:43] like uh we could think
[1:26:46] also uh but because it's Congo River is
[1:26:50] Big it's like uh more than uh to cross
[1:26:53] it's like up to 00 meters to cross
[1:26:57] across the
[1:26:59] so uh they went back and forth among
[1:27:03] themselves to be to agreed as to put me
[1:27:07] in this canoe or not after back and
[1:27:10] forth they decide to put me in and this
[1:27:14] canoe almost s was like a small part
[1:27:17] like this that was left above the
[1:27:19] water and uh we crossed the river
[1:27:24] we cut the other side of the river
[1:27:28] almost around 4:
[1:27:31] p.m. uh uh what we found there was even
[1:27:36] worse because people from all water
[1:27:38] ports around the cities were crossing
[1:27:41] there people that were shot didn't die
[1:27:44] uh they were in this V so we cut we
[1:27:47] found even more people there that were
[1:27:49] already shut and uh laying all over the
[1:27:53] places there's no hospital there is no a
[1:27:56] nurse or a doctor it's like there was
[1:27:58] only one nurse actually who didn't know
[1:28:01] what to do now because he's used to
[1:28:03] treat like small cats from people Fe
[1:28:07] treat fever and things like that but now
[1:28:09] he has like uh uh these people shut all
[1:28:13] over so he's he doesn't know what to do
[1:28:16] he's just going by people he empathize
[1:28:19] with trying to keep them like T nor to
[1:28:23] helm come the
[1:28:25] pain so we were just laying there
[1:28:28] knowing not what to
[1:28:29] do and uh the pain was so much
[1:28:35] that I didn't even know where I was
[1:28:38] again or what was going on I didn't feel
[1:28:40] pain no more so I was just
[1:28:43] there until uh almost uh 5 6ish p.m.
[1:28:50] that's when uh at the same time when
[1:28:53] these things were going G on the North
[1:28:55] the news went across the river that the
[1:28:59] massacre is happening so the United
[1:29:02] Nation heard also the same news they
[1:29:05] sent a motorized boat uh to the north
[1:29:09] through the water so when they reached
[1:29:12] there uh they found us and uh they start
[1:29:15] picking up people to rescue them to
[1:29:17] bring them to the uh cities where there
[1:29:20] was aspiro and things like that so the
[1:29:25] uh picked me up uh it was almost at 6:00
[1:29:29] p.m. that's uh when uh I realized that I
[1:29:34] almost died or something because I
[1:29:37] didn't know where I was I didn't know
[1:29:39] what was happening just as as at one
[1:29:42] point that's when I felt pain when I
[1:29:45] felt pain I trying to to scream in pain
[1:29:49] because my leg was dangling like this
[1:29:52] sorry this thing so loud
[1:29:56] okay so my leg was dangling so it was
[1:30:00] like so much pain and uh the sight
[1:30:05] movement you can feel like every nerve
[1:30:07] in your body screaming
[1:30:10] so when I felt this pain I screamed so
[1:30:14] that's and open my eyes so one of the
[1:30:18] people around me was like shocked he was
[1:30:21] like you really still alive
[1:30:25] like what do you mean that's in my
[1:30:29] heart so that's when I realized that
[1:30:32] maybe I was out already and uh didn't
[1:30:35] know that but just when he said that and
[1:30:39] I because when uh he said that I found
[1:30:41] myself on people shoulders to carry me
[1:30:45] to the boat that's when oh I'm on people
[1:30:48] shoulders um I got to the boat um and
[1:30:52] they sent uh brought us to a bigger city
[1:30:55] we got there around 8:00
[1:30:58] p.m. there was a big city um big
[1:31:02] hospital but no medical
[1:31:05] equipment so we we spent a night in this
[1:31:08] hospital without care so what they did
[1:31:11] was just uh because my leg was so
[1:31:14] dangling so they just put two planks of
[1:31:17] wood along my leg and tied it up so that
[1:31:21] it doesn't move as much um
[1:31:25] I we spent a night there the following
[1:31:28] day uh to evening again that's when they
[1:31:32] picked us up to another bigger
[1:31:36] city we cut there at night and
[1:31:41] uh it was also a big hospital nice
[1:31:44] hospital with medical equipment but no
[1:31:48] doctors so we spend the night in this uh
[1:31:52] Hospital
[1:31:54] um
[1:31:56] but uh at this time already I
[1:31:59] was um almost rotten because nobody
[1:32:04] could come to that door if I'm here
[1:32:06] nobody could come to that door because
[1:32:09] the smell was so bad he was like R was
[1:32:13] like past everything going on so uh
[1:32:17] there was no almost no hope at this
[1:32:19] point because we like what's the point
[1:32:24] uh there was no point but uh God in his
[1:32:28] big plan he
[1:32:30] says the plans he has for us is the plan
[1:32:34] of success and not the plan uh that to
[1:32:40] harm us so um in his plan he has already
[1:32:45] prepared that's uh what I say
[1:32:50] here after these three Hospital almost
[1:32:54] with no medical care the fourth day this
[1:32:58] big city we cut in was called info um
[1:33:02] and uh God Made A Way in a way that in
[1:33:05] that same city there was a small
[1:33:08] hospital that small hospital was founded
[1:33:11] by an American
[1:33:13] missionary uh uh missioner how you say
[1:33:17] yeah so this American missionary you can
[1:33:21] find him on we on Google he
[1:33:24] had a calling to co to Congo brazaville
[1:33:28] to help people through the uh Health
[1:33:32] Care he is a doctor so uh he had found
[1:33:36] this small hospital and each year they
[1:33:39] are a volunteer from around the Americas
[1:33:43] like United State and the South America
[1:33:46] who called there to volunteer uh helping
[1:33:50] people uh with different cases that are
[1:33:53] not treatable by African means so when
[1:33:58] they uh that that same year that same
[1:34:01] night when we C in info that's the same
[1:34:05] night that a team from here uh from
[1:34:09] America cut in this in that hospital to
[1:34:14] volunteer and uh he happened to
[1:34:18] be uh he happened to be a special
[1:34:30] orthopedists so that's why I called them
[1:34:33] Angels sent from
[1:34:36] God so uh that's uh when they heard this
[1:34:43] that this team arrived almost the same
[1:34:45] night as we the same night we got also
[1:34:47] in that City so in morning they sent
[1:34:50] request to see if they could come to the
[1:34:53] this hospital and treat us so um but
[1:34:58] they didn't want to come to this one
[1:35:00] hospital because maybe they were not
[1:35:02] familiar with the instrument there but
[1:35:05] they request that they bring us to that
[1:35:07] small hospital where they
[1:35:09] were so when we got there it was also at
[1:35:15] night that's why I said like fourth day
[1:35:18] after being shot no medical care that
[1:35:22] were appropriate so
[1:35:24] uh that's when we got there we were many
[1:35:27] people and uh they had to do what they
[1:35:29] could do um to save whom they could save
[1:35:35] and uh and the only way to save some was
[1:35:40] amputations so they amputated almost
[1:35:42] everybody in before me that went in to O
[1:35:47] because they couldn't save the infection
[1:35:49] was so much um uh so so when my time
[1:35:55] came and my case was even more worse
[1:35:57] because it was in the thigh uh in the
[1:36:00] thigh for those who are familiar with uh
[1:36:04] um physiology and everything there are
[1:36:06] more fat more um creas in the thigh than
[1:36:10] other part like arms and cough so when
[1:36:15] you have infection in the thigh it's
[1:36:17] more uh difficult to to control then if
[1:36:22] you have it elsewhere
[1:36:24] so at this time my infection was so
[1:36:27] spread that he went way back in the
[1:36:30] bones and and infection in the bone it
[1:36:33] is almost impossible to treat also yeah
[1:36:37] so that's
[1:36:39] uh everybody went before me and got
[1:36:42] amputated so I was like now I'm going to
[1:36:46] be
[1:36:47] amputated uh that's why you see at the
[1:36:50] beginning I talked about a uh Dreadful
[1:36:54] day or a faithful day Dreadful day
[1:36:59] because I was so afraid of become Ang
[1:37:05] kept from when I was young so I would be
[1:37:08] like if I con Street see andap people I
[1:37:12] would be feeling so bad I be like trying
[1:37:15] to help everybody who but I was thinking
[1:37:19] as a young person if ever I become
[1:37:22] handicapped there was no o to leave I
[1:37:25] have to kill
[1:37:27] myself but now I was before that same
[1:37:32] fact that in next few minutes I'll be
[1:37:36] amputated and
[1:37:38] uh it was worse than knowing that I cut
[1:37:42] shot and then uh when I cut in over for
[1:37:47] some reason this
[1:37:50] doctor
[1:37:52] um
[1:37:55] that's uh after surgery one of the
[1:37:57] surgeries because I'm going on to have
[1:38:00] more surgeries
[1:38:02] so uh for some reason this doctor
[1:38:05] here is the one the chief
[1:38:09] orthopedist uh Dr ol he was accompanied
[1:38:13] by this Dr Carlos and there is another
[1:38:17] doctor who is not in a picture here but
[1:38:19] him is the founder of this uh small
[1:38:23] Hospital over
[1:38:25] there so when I went in a they did
[1:38:30] surgery and for some reason they decide
[1:38:33] not to amputate me I'm
[1:38:36] like this C to be card because there's
[1:38:41] no there was no explanation and uh
[1:38:44] beside me there was only one other
[1:38:46] person that was not
[1:38:47] unrated uh him had just a shot in the
[1:38:51] lower part of the lake in the cough and
[1:38:54] it was like the bullet like went through
[1:38:58] the bone but the bone was not broken in
[1:39:01] half yeah that's why he didn't get
[1:39:03] amputated but he had also infection but
[1:39:07] because he was in the lower part of the
[1:39:08] bone of the leg was not as bad um so
[1:39:13] when they preserved my leg it was like
[1:39:16] the only way to do this is like intense
[1:39:19] antibiotic treatment so that's why they
[1:39:23] did um the picture is not as clear if
[1:39:27] you see that there is like two barel of
[1:39:30] fluid those flu are not like the IV
[1:39:33] fluid as we have them even though I was
[1:39:35] having the IV flu IV antibiotics but was
[1:39:40] like irrigation this antibiotic
[1:39:43] irrigation uh it ca right inside my leg
[1:39:47] to irrigate the leg and there is a
[1:39:49] collection back on the
[1:39:52] side so
[1:39:54] is like 24 hours just running there and
[1:39:58] cleaning and being collected at the same
[1:40:01] time I'm getting also uh antibiotic
[1:40:05] through IV and other means so this went
[1:40:08] on for
[1:40:11] months so after this first surgery it
[1:40:15] didn't succeed the infection was not
[1:40:18] controlled so they brought me back in
[1:40:20] the war again after few weeks uh no
[1:40:24] change because the infection was so much
[1:40:27] spread inside the bone that antibiotic
[1:40:30] didn't do
[1:40:31] nothing so
[1:40:34] um eventually the doctor the team that
[1:40:37] came did leave went back to America uh
[1:40:42] and uh I was just with uh uh him uh Dr
[1:40:47] Joseph
[1:40:49] Harvey
[1:40:51] so uh he continued the antibiotic
[1:40:54] treatment as he saw that there was no
[1:40:58] success he decide to go in and cut the
[1:41:04] parts of the bone that were infected to
[1:41:08] stop the
[1:41:10] spreading so uh he brought me to O he
[1:41:14] cut the bone at the end of surgery he
[1:41:16] showed me like big out of the bones I'm
[1:41:19] like wow this is my bone here
[1:41:24] uh
[1:41:26] so he did that and brought the two ends
[1:41:29] of the bond together in hope that he can
[1:41:32] uh grow and heal each
[1:41:35] together um and uh I had a a device
[1:41:40] called external fixer I think you guys
[1:41:43] are familiar with that I had this thing
[1:41:46] the whole
[1:41:48] time
[1:41:50] so afterward after months and months of
[1:41:53] treatment without success that's when uh
[1:41:57] I had decided that I had to go somewhere
[1:42:01] else but you can wonder how uh who
[1:42:05] helped me through all this process uh uh
[1:42:11] I didn't have nobody no one I was in a
[1:42:15] foreign country I was bed bound I was uh
[1:42:20] I didn't know even much of languages
[1:42:24] spoken around so I
[1:42:26] was throughout cared for by God himself
[1:42:35] because because from the first city we
[1:42:39] cut in uh after we got picked up by the
[1:42:43] un uh that came with a motorized boat in
[1:42:47] that City there was one person who
[1:42:50] didn't know me nothing but just because
[1:42:55] he heard my story that I'm far away from
[1:42:58] my uh Province and um I have nobody here
[1:43:03] to care for me so this individual decide
[1:43:06] to leave everything that he had to
[1:43:10] accompany me
[1:43:11] everywhere that's
[1:43:15] him is somebody I never knew I never
[1:43:18] seen he just decid to leave all that he
[1:43:22] was doing and start working with me
[1:43:24] throughout these whole
[1:43:27] hospitals until the day I left brazille
[1:43:30] to come here to America we were still
[1:43:32] with this person so there
[1:43:35] is uh nothing that can explain that
[1:43:39] water than the hand of
[1:43:41] God so uh after I left uh uh bra uh left
[1:43:47] in Fondo this uh uh doctor this is just
[1:43:52] some of the pictures for what the care I
[1:43:56] was getting there this is the medical
[1:43:59] team this is one of the victims this is
[1:44:01] another victim that got amputated you
[1:44:03] can't see his arms but his arm is
[1:44:07] amputated and uh this is medical staff
[1:44:10] and this is the team that took care of
[1:44:14] us so um after I left there I was
[1:44:19] transferred to
[1:44:20] brazaville uh still in the care of
[1:44:24] United Nation um usually uh United
[1:44:28] Nation when they take people as refugees
[1:44:30] they are in a camps like it's Collective
[1:44:34] treatment you don't get special
[1:44:36] treatment because you're not special
[1:44:39] than anybody but God made me special not
[1:44:43] because I was
[1:44:47] special so um these people took care of
[1:44:51] me in a way that when I cut you
[1:44:53] brazaville I was loded in a hotel for
[1:44:56] more than a year and they paid
[1:44:59] everything um and I took uh I cut a
[1:45:05] health
[1:45:07] treatment the first one was another
[1:45:10] surgery they did
[1:45:12] surgery uh in brazaville but they
[1:45:16] couldn't control the infection because
[1:45:19] at the same
[1:45:20] time the lake was like has a hole from
[1:45:24] top to bottom and the infection was
[1:45:26] pouring from both sides so um the only
[1:45:30] thing that was holding the leg together
[1:45:32] was fixer the external fixer but in
[1:45:36] brazille the doctor was thinking if this
[1:45:39] thing stays in for too long it can cause
[1:45:42] something even worse so now we have to
[1:45:46] take the fix out to give the bone the
[1:45:51] time to uh heal from
[1:45:54] infection and then uh they took the
[1:45:57] fixer out my legs was like stayed like
[1:46:02] this he said instead of leaving it like
[1:46:05] this let's put a cast on he put on a
[1:46:08] cast and uh uh left a hole on top and
[1:46:12] bottom to give space for infection
[1:46:17] drainage but after few months is like
[1:46:21] it's uh it's not helping because the
[1:46:23] bone didn't heal uh so he took the cast
[1:46:28] out so then I have only a broken leg
[1:46:32] walking around with it on
[1:46:36] crutches so at this point there was no
[1:46:41] other uh in there hope inside because
[1:46:46] everything that could have been done has
[1:46:48] been done and at this time I'm going to
[1:46:51] be to content
[1:46:53] with uh working on crutches the rest of
[1:46:57] my life with a broken leg and infection
[1:47:01] running through it
[1:47:03] so I got so
[1:47:07] discouraged and so despair that I didn't
[1:47:10] see the mean of living again because I
[1:47:13] knew that I'm in a foreign country
[1:47:15] nobody to lean on so there's nothing I
[1:47:19] can do physically to help myself for
[1:47:21] future for anything things so all this
[1:47:25] brought me down bad so I was
[1:47:32] like when I compare my situation with my
[1:47:35] ambitions and everything I'm like
[1:47:38] no no no way to live like this so one
[1:47:42] day I DET that I was going to end my
[1:47:46] life so I was in my uh Hospital uh uh
[1:47:52] Hotel hotel
[1:47:54] room uh but at the same time I was going
[1:47:57] I uh going to a a church that was around
[1:48:00] the the block where I
[1:48:04] lived uh I was going there that's where
[1:48:08] I
[1:48:09] met uh this
[1:48:12] pastor uh he a pastor Bosworth both of
[1:48:18] he went on to pass away uh last uh last
[1:48:21] two years in 2020
[1:48:23] one uh he he passed away but he was a
[1:48:30] person that God used to preserve my life
[1:48:33] at that
[1:48:35] time because when
[1:48:38] after uh deciding that I'm going to end
[1:48:41] my life I'm like but I still love God so
[1:48:46] I have to go to church and then see what
[1:48:49] happened after
[1:48:51] that I went to church that Sunday
[1:48:54] morning
[1:48:55] uh when they start we sang and
[1:48:59] everything when he went up to the pet to
[1:49:02] start preaching so he called my name and
[1:49:05] said uh he need to see me after the
[1:49:09] service so I didn't know what was going
[1:49:13] to happen after the service that's when
[1:49:16] we sat down with him and he told me that
[1:49:19] God told me that you want to
[1:49:23] commit
[1:49:25] suicide I'm like what how did you know
[1:49:30] that and he said so why do you want to
[1:49:33] commit
[1:49:35] suicide and he went on to uh talk to me
[1:49:39] uh to encourage me and showing me
[1:49:43] scriptures that's when I gave up on that
[1:49:46] uh
[1:49:50] idea
[1:49:51] so is to say that uh in every step of
[1:49:55] the way God has always always somebody
[1:49:58] or some instrument to help you get to
[1:50:02] the uh your
[1:50:05] destiny
[1:50:06] so at this
[1:50:08] time uh we we start praying again so
[1:50:13] that God can make a way for me to get uh
[1:50:18] health care I needed but the only what I
[1:50:21] mean was to go abroad
[1:50:23] to the West here or Europe Canada
[1:50:26] Australia where there is like Advanced
[1:50:29] science to to treat but how would you
[1:50:32] get there no way so there's no money
[1:50:36] there is no somebody you know so that's
[1:50:40] when I met with somebody else who told
[1:50:42] me that you could request from un uh for
[1:50:47] you to be transferred from your where
[1:50:50] you are to another country I'm like how
[1:50:52] is that possible it's like yeah they can
[1:50:55] okay let's put Faith on it and uh go
[1:50:58] forward so uh but for un to act they
[1:51:03] have to have a proof material of proof
[1:51:06] that where you were at the time they
[1:51:08] cannot treat you so uh now it was
[1:51:13] another battle that opened up because I
[1:51:15] had to get a official document that
[1:51:19] testify that everything has been done
[1:51:22] there is
[1:51:23] no help for him here he has to go
[1:51:28] elsewhere that's when I start uh going
[1:51:31] after the chief uh physician of the the
[1:51:36] Congo the the Congo is like
[1:51:39] a like a chief of cabinet somebody who
[1:51:43] works in the Ministry of Health so who
[1:51:47] can provide a
[1:51:49] document but to get to them it's a big
[1:51:54] big process is like it's like going to
[1:51:58] see the president
[1:52:00] himself so we went back and forth with
[1:52:04] my physician he's like for to see him
[1:52:07] he's somebody who travels who he doesn't
[1:52:10] have time to see anybody like uh
[1:52:12] somebody like a patient no you have to
[1:52:16] to be somebody in the ring to see them
[1:52:19] like who can do go see him for me no
[1:52:22] nobody so we start praying so that God
[1:52:25] can make a way for me to see
[1:52:28] him so we prayed prayed prayed until at
[1:52:32] the end God opened the door again and uh
[1:52:36] we went to see this person he was just
[1:52:38] right after the minister of the health
[1:52:41] things like that so he uh I talked with
[1:52:46] him and then he wrote this letter which
[1:52:49] I brought to the
[1:52:51] UN and and uh explained to them that I
[1:52:54] then I WR I made the formal application
[1:52:58] demanding uh resettlement so uh for
[1:53:02] people who are familiar with the un u uh
[1:53:06] organization resettlement is when they
[1:53:09] decide to take you from one uh place
[1:53:12] resettle you to another place uh uh
[1:53:15] because of your safety or things like
[1:53:19] that so but this one was not going to be
[1:53:23] based on Health Care uh
[1:53:26] resettlement that's uh when
[1:53:32] um uh I cut this document and uh did the
[1:53:38] application but through these old
[1:53:40] things what I saw was like
[1:53:44] uh what helped me uh sustain uh what
[1:53:49] sustained me was more of broadly love
[1:53:53] I was caring from people in the church
[1:53:57] uh people
[1:53:59] who really embraced me like uh even
[1:54:04] though I didn't know anybody but they
[1:54:06] were there to support and everything so
[1:54:10] that's when I really and God helped a
[1:54:13] lot also so he said be still and know
[1:54:16] that I am God I will be exalted among
[1:54:19] the heaven I will be exalted in the
[1:54:21] Earth
[1:54:26] so the UN in Congo worked with a n n is
[1:54:34] uh I think you guys familiar with n is
[1:54:37] uh self organizations that works
[1:54:41] independently from the
[1:54:43] government so uh this NGO was called um
[1:54:49] uh medic fre who African Physicians or a
[1:54:54] physician from Africa something like
[1:54:57] that so this NGO was working with uh
[1:55:03] unhcr uh in a way that when there is
[1:55:06] refugees who are sick so un would give
[1:55:10] this people this uh patient to this NGO
[1:55:14] for them to take care of them and then
[1:55:17] do the report to the uh un uh for the
[1:55:22] financing
[1:55:24] purposes and then when I cut this letter
[1:55:28] from the doctor so un told these people
[1:55:32] to follow my
[1:55:34] case uh that they can go up to the end
[1:55:38] uh to get me approved for um
[1:55:43] resettlement
[1:55:44] but for some reason uh as you know when
[1:55:49] God is in the move the devil also is in
[1:55:51] the move
[1:55:53] so uh the devil was not happy so happy
[1:55:56] that the light was pointing at the end
[1:55:59] of the tel so uh some of the people in
[1:56:04] this NGO start putting blocks in the
[1:56:09] process until to the point that uh
[1:56:13] because when there is a request such
[1:56:16] like this the UN would uh present the
[1:56:20] case to countries who are in a
[1:56:24] partnership with them most of them is US
[1:56:27] Canada and European countries and
[1:56:30] Australia so they are in a partnership
[1:56:32] with un if un has refugees who need uh
[1:56:36] resettlement for safety reason or health
[1:56:39] reasons you will present the case to all
[1:56:42] these countries so there's one that is
[1:56:45] going to accept say okay we want this
[1:56:48] patient to come here and we can take
[1:56:51] care of them
[1:56:53] so my Cas was already sent out to the uh
[1:56:56] countries that would
[1:56:58] accept uh but at the same time I was
[1:57:01] just waiting for a delegation to come
[1:57:03] see me and we go from
[1:57:05] there but these people went on to tell
[1:57:10] the UN HCR that no he's healed he
[1:57:14] doesn't need any he care so no need for
[1:57:17] his
[1:57:20] settlement so like
[1:57:23] wow this
[1:57:25] is uh I got
[1:57:28] troubled because there was no way that
[1:57:31] could be true but uh at the same time uh
[1:57:35] in Exodus 14 13-4 it says and Moses says
[1:57:40] unto the people fear ye not stand still
[1:57:43] and see the salvation of the Lord which
[1:57:46] he will show you to you today for the
[1:57:50] Egypt Egyptian whom he have seen today
[1:57:53] he shall see them again no more
[1:57:58] forever for whereas ye have seen the
[1:58:01] Egyptian today the Lord shall fight for
[1:58:04] you and you shall see hold your
[1:58:09] peace so that's uh when God intervened
[1:58:14] again and uh I presented the case to the
[1:58:19] UN when uh uh when they told me that you
[1:58:21] are are healed and everything so I
[1:58:24] presented the facts and uh letter and
[1:58:26] everything so I told them that these
[1:58:28] people have to show you also the same
[1:58:31] evidence that uh some health authority
[1:58:35] showed them that I'm Healed so that you
[1:58:37] can decide uh so unfortunately for them
[1:58:42] they didn't have any material
[1:58:45] proof so that's when they got in big
[1:58:48] trouble after me actually when I left so
[1:58:52] because they wanted to uh interfere with
[1:58:56] the care of a patient so which is not
[1:58:59] good for business with un so um that's
[1:59:05] uh how uh the hand of God was showed
[1:59:08] again shown again in this
[1:59:12] situation so
[1:59:15] um through this all is not just saying
[1:59:19] I'm not saying it just to
[1:59:23] uh for some certain reason it's for
[1:59:25] somebody who might
[1:59:27] go be going through the same things or
[1:59:31] orse they may know that there is no
[1:59:35] thing that is impossible for God and if
[1:59:38] God has already uh made a way for you no
[1:59:42] matter what will arise uh God will come
[1:59:45] to the uh to the finishing of that
[1:59:49] purpose so that's in
[1:59:52] 2015 that's when I got here um from the
[1:59:58] Congo uh I
[2:00:00] was
[2:00:02] uh surprised to see that God had already
[2:00:07] prepared a new
[2:00:09] family not only uh physical or caral
[2:00:13] family also Christian
[2:00:15] family so I was there
[2:00:20] uh
[2:00:23] got a new family when I as soon as I
[2:00:25] landed from the airport I saw these
[2:00:28] people welcoming me whom I didn't know I
[2:00:31] didn't heard about them and everything
[2:00:34] and uh they took me right straight to
[2:00:36] their house and uh since then they've
[2:00:40] been like a family to me as you can see
[2:00:45] them over there they've been here a few
[2:00:48] times some of them and uh uh uh to show
[2:00:53] that even though I lost my parent early
[2:00:56] a in age
[2:00:58] didn't grow up with the feeling of being
[2:01:01] loved as a child and everything but this
[2:01:05] family showed me more than I could
[2:01:08] expect they really really love me more
[2:01:12] it go beyond I don't know if people who
[2:01:15] are raised with parent uh can feel that
[2:01:18] but if you have your parents say thank
[2:01:20] you to God because not having your
[2:01:24] parent early in age it's a feeling that
[2:01:27] only somebody who experienced that can
[2:01:31] explain but if you have parent please be
[2:01:35] thankful to God and say thank you um so
[2:01:39] this that's when I feel that feeling
[2:01:42] that people who have their parent can
[2:01:43] feel also is when I got uh this
[2:01:47] family because we have they believe some
[2:01:51] they believe they are Baptist they live
[2:01:54] believe something different I believe
[2:01:56] the message and we lived in the same
[2:01:58] house but we wouldn't know that we have
[2:02:03] different beliefs so they showed me real
[2:02:08] love
[2:02:10] so not only uh through with them I went
[2:02:14] through three other surgeries here as
[2:02:17] you know when I got here in 2015 I got a
[2:02:20] surgery in in uh June or uh in
[2:02:25] June that was just to control my
[2:02:28] infection and to get the bone I the leg
[2:02:32] to be able to work again because I've
[2:02:34] been on crotches for six years uh prior
[2:02:38] to that
[2:02:40] so um I get the first I got the first
[2:02:44] surgery they did uh were able to put a
[2:02:47] plate inside and control the infection
[2:02:50] and I was able to walk but we fa a
[2:02:52] shorter leg so I was uh liming so the
[2:02:57] only way for me to walk on my two feets
[2:03:00] or to have a lifted um heel yeah that
[2:03:06] big shoe I used to wear so that's how I
[2:03:09] was able to work uh and uh and also
[2:03:15] believe it or not that doctor that that
[2:03:17] that did that Sur told me that you'll be
[2:03:20] happy with this for rest of your life
[2:03:22] that's because there is no technology
[2:03:24] that can help you cow your leg again I'm
[2:03:30] like doesn't matter now I can walk
[2:03:33] that's all I wanted so but I didn't give
[2:03:38] up my uh my faith in the ability to walk
[2:03:43] on my uh both feet with same length
[2:03:47] because God when he start doing
[2:03:50] something he would not leave it
[2:03:52] unfinished he will go it to the
[2:03:56] end so this was already God in move
[2:04:01] so when he told me this I doubted but
[2:04:05] I'm like since he is the certified uh
[2:04:08] physician so I going to hold on that for
[2:04:10] now but I'll not give up fighting so uh
[2:04:15] God also intervene that he left that
[2:04:18] hospital then when I went for one of the
[2:04:21] follow up I met one of his assistant who
[2:04:25] took over him and uh presented him with
[2:04:28] the cas I'm like uh what's what are the
[2:04:32] possibilities to get my leg lengthen
[2:04:35] again he's like oh you know what uh
[2:04:39] actually there is this new technology
[2:04:41] that just got popular now it is that
[2:04:45] they can put a a rod inside your bone
[2:04:49] and get your I'm like is that really yes
[2:04:52] but at the time I was not uh I didn't
[2:04:56] have a good insurance because the
[2:04:58] government assur
[2:05:00] insurance is selective there is certain
[2:05:03] cases that they don't they don't cover
[2:05:06] and but at the time I was still on
[2:05:08] government insurance but I was in school
[2:05:12] I'm like for now my purpose is to finish
[2:05:16] school get uh private insurance and I
[2:05:20] have to get this thing
[2:05:23] done and God also intervened through the
[2:05:26] schools I finished and uh went back to
[2:05:31] him and uh he said um we can do it but
[2:05:35] I'm not very experienced in this domain
[2:05:39] but I know somebody who is more
[2:05:42] experienced than me uh that can help you
[2:05:46] I'm like okay um you can refer me to
[2:05:49] them he said yes uh
[2:05:52] he happened to be that he worked at the
[2:05:55] uh uh University Hospital and uh at this
[2:05:59] time I was I was already applying the
[2:06:02] job at the
[2:06:04] uh and I can't accept that uh and the
[2:06:09] same time I can't accept at the uh
[2:06:12] that's the same time I went to see this
[2:06:14] doctor that was a
[2:06:17] specialist and uh he said yes he can do
[2:06:21] it
[2:06:22] uh but I had to be like one year at work
[2:06:26] before I can leave for like medical
[2:06:29] reasons and things like that so one year
[2:06:32] later he was able to do the surgery and
[2:06:36] put in the
[2:06:37] rod uh to lengthen the leg so uh which
[2:06:43] was another miracle
[2:06:45] because
[2:06:47] uh putting a rod in your bone that is
[2:06:50] going to craw to make your leg leg
[2:06:53] longer is something I've never heard of
[2:06:56] so for me it was hand of God again so
[2:07:00] it's something to be thankful to God so
[2:07:03] that's why I testify that God he can
[2:07:06] heal by
[2:07:07] Miracles um but he can also heal by the
[2:07:11] hand of mens but through all the glory
[2:07:15] come back to him
[2:07:17] am so um and last year that's when when
[2:07:21] they were able to take out the rod out
[2:07:24] of my bone so I have my both legs same
[2:07:28] length I can
[2:07:33] walk
[2:07:36] actually uh so actually I can challenge
[2:07:39] anyone to you to a
[2:07:41] Race So that but is to say that God is
[2:07:48] faithful God who amen who whose eyes are
[2:07:52] on The Sparrows he watches us so that's
[2:07:56] why I want really to be thankful because
[2:08:00] in through all this also God provided
[2:08:03] people that were there to support so it
[2:08:08] is
[2:08:11] oh is the battery
[2:08:14] okay of
[2:08:18] on
[2:08:20] Okay so this is the family that
[2:08:23] supported me throughout this process
[2:08:26] again through
[2:08:28] prayers
[2:08:30] encouragement uh it's more valuable than
[2:08:35] anything I can uh count on so it
[2:08:40] is uh with
[2:08:43] uh all all of my heart I say thank you
[2:08:46] to each one and each of you for all the
[2:08:49] effort you've done supporting me through
[2:08:51] the prayers through the enouragement
[2:08:55] everything uh I I can't call names here
[2:08:58] it's going to be too much so God bless
[2:09:00] you it's uh been a good um support and
[2:09:06] uh all
[2:09:08] the this is also another testimony that
[2:09:11] not knowing English not being out being
[2:09:15] out of school for so long and being able
[2:09:17] to come back study finish and start
[2:09:20] working
[2:09:22] it's not that I'm very smart now far
[2:09:25] from that God helped me through also
[2:09:28] your support so I really want to say
[2:09:32] thank you to you uh for all that uh so
[2:09:37] as I said here from patient to caregiver
[2:09:40] so I was cared
[2:09:43] for for so many years so now God has
[2:09:47] given me the opportunity to care for
[2:09:49] other people amen so
[2:09:51] it's uh those are the testimony
[2:09:57] so we need just to trust in God in
[2:10:01] everything that's uh because there is
[2:10:05] without all without God all this will
[2:10:07] not be able to from the human uh
[2:10:11] conception it's almost impossible but
[2:10:15] seeing what God has made has done we
[2:10:18] have more reason to trust him so it's
[2:10:23] uh
[2:10:25] um God the things I've said here that
[2:10:29] God has done in my life uh he can do it
[2:10:33] to each and
[2:10:34] everyone if you trust in him in the same
[2:10:39] way because brother Bram says here
[2:10:43] um for the first part of Psalms there he
[2:10:47] says our fathers trust in thee they
[2:10:49] trust and thou
[2:10:52] deliver uh Juds delivered them they
[2:10:55] cried onto thee and were delivered they
[2:10:58] trust in thee and were not
[2:11:00] confounded so God will never let you
[2:11:03] down for any reason so brother Braham
[2:11:06] said on went on to say listen to this if
[2:11:10] God doesn't act the same when this uh uh
[2:11:15] when the same circumstances AR arise
[2:11:18] then God is guilty of being partial to
[2:11:20] his people
[2:11:22] God's sovereignty demand demand uh
[2:11:26] sovereignty demands of him to walk in
[2:11:28] every case like he did the first case or
[2:11:33] he was wrong when he walked in the first
[2:11:35] case if God doesn't act in the same way
[2:11:39] he did the same way he did on the first
[2:11:41] case he will if he will act different to
[2:11:46] the second case then he acted wrong when
[2:11:49] he acted on the first case if God healed
[2:11:53] the sick in the Old Testament is cut to
[2:11:57] do in the New Testament and today or he
[2:12:01] did wrong when he healed them back there
[2:12:04] he is Hebrews chapter
[2:12:07] 45 got to act the same every time and he
[2:12:12] will do it when the same Faith meets the
[2:12:16] condition the fault is in us not in God
[2:12:21] for we see him on
[2:12:24] some and many work many work create
[2:12:28] outstanding
[2:12:29] Miracles we know it the critic cannot
[2:12:33] say it's not so for we see it amen uh
[2:12:38] prove it and there it
[2:12:43] is so it is uh God is uh is not partial
[2:12:51] amen as if your faith meets the same
[2:12:55] demand same requirement God will act so
[2:13:00] um it
[2:13:04] is
[2:13:09] um that's the point of this testimony so
[2:13:13] um he it for me he will keep doing it
[2:13:17] what he has done is what I have said
[2:13:20] here is just little part so many other
[2:13:23] things I could say but the purpose of
[2:13:25] time I have to stop here and want to say
[2:13:30] keep trusting God is able to do anything
[2:13:34] so God bless you for all your prayers
[2:13:37] and all your support I hope uh I'll keep
[2:13:42] getting uh strength from all this
[2:13:44] testimonal as well God bless
[2:13:50] you
[2:14:04] we just stand I just want to sing song
[2:14:06] sing with our voices Ben if you just
[2:14:07] want to jump on the piano real quick
[2:14:10] let's sing this song and then I'm going
[2:14:11] to ask brother Josh way to pray if
[2:14:13] you've got a need or request on your
[2:14:15] heart I I think about how when brother
[2:14:18] brandham talked about the the mother
[2:14:20] when she was led of the Lord to pray for
[2:14:23] the little child and she prayed and
[2:14:27] brother brandham when that lady came
[2:14:30] with a baby up to the
[2:14:32] platform the Holy Spirit announced that
[2:14:34] your baby was already healed when that
[2:14:36] sister prayed for him and brother bradam
[2:14:39] he pointed out to us and he said what it
[2:14:41] is he said that mother that sister was a
[2:14:44] mother she would have more of a
[2:14:47] compassion and a sympathy and been able
[2:14:50] to reach for that child than what I
[2:14:53] would and I believe that was same thing
[2:14:55] with each of us as we've gone through
[2:14:57] certain things and we hear request
[2:15:01] mentioned that is a testimony that's not
[2:15:05] just what God has brought us through but
[2:15:07] it's a witness what God has done for one
[2:15:11] he'll do for another and God puts you
[2:15:14] and I into a place to where we're able
[2:15:16] to step into the shoes and pray for one
[2:15:19] another that's right so every every
[2:15:22] circumstance test trial so forth It's
[2:15:25] Not only God molding and making us but
[2:15:27] it's where we come more in tune to be
[2:15:30] more of an
[2:15:31] intercessor as a spiritual priest for
[2:15:35] one another I want to just sing this
[2:15:37] song just just the course one time
[2:15:39] through

[2:15:47] way when our backs were against the
[2:15:51] wall and it looked to see if he
